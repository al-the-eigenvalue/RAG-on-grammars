another clause (as in (107) above), and (110) below. The use of a reportative
construction seems to serve a function of making the command more ‘soft’, or more
polite:

As seen in (110) above, constituent order in negative imperatives clauses is
typically verb final; and whenever both the subject and object are overtly expressed
through a lexical noun or free pronoun, the order of subject and object is inverted
from the typical SOV basic order in Kakua, resulting in OSV (although speakers
accept other orders). The change of the preferred order into an OSV order is typical
for imperative clauses cross-linguistically (c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97).
12.13 Responding to imperatives
Responses to imperative clauses are constructed like responses to questions
(described in §12.10 above under interrogative polar and content questions).
̃̂ ‘yes’, or
Commands are usually responded to with the particle (interjection) hɨhɨ
another particle with affirmative meaning (see Chapter 3 for a list of particles and
interjections in Kakua), such as da! ‘thereǃ’, among others. Additionally (as with
questions), imperatives can be responded to by repeating the predicate of the
imperative clause in a declarative construction. Example in (111) below illustrates a
response to a command:Basic clause structure and types of clauses341waj-kan=héʔ

Negative responses to a command are also constructed like negative responses
to questions. A negative response may involve repeating the predicate in the
imperative clause, adding the negation marker -kan as illustrated in (112):

12.14 Summary
This chapter describes the basic clause structure in Kakua. A minimal clause
contains at least one predicate. Given that cross-referencing proclitics can stand for
the subject NP of the clause, the overt expression of the subject NP is not obligatory
in order to form a clause. In basic clauses involving predicates with semantically
transitive verb roots, the object argument NP generally precedes the predicate of the
clause. Most other clause types also prefer the basic SOV order of constituents. An
exception to this is the imperative clause, which prefers an OSV order.
The basic clause structures of copula constructions (affirmative and negative
copular clauses), predicative possessive clauses, comparatives, verbless clauses, and
basic locative clauses were described in sections §12.2 to §12.7 respectively. It was
also shown that nonverbal clauses represent a common strategy in Kakua to express
equative copular meanings.
This chapter ended with a description of the structure and coding of
declarative, interrogative and imperative (both affirmative and negative) clauses in
§12.10 and §12.11. Kakua declarative clauses represent the default type of clause.
Additionally, there is a morpheme which expresses an imperative mood for
when the request is to perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The origin
of this morpheme is obscure, and a diachronic explanation is still to be found in
order to have a more accurate approach to analyze the form. Future research,342A Grammar of Kakuaincluding perhaps a comparative analysis between Kakua, Nɨkak and other
neighboring languages, will undoubtedly presents us with fascinating hypotheses on
the origin of this form.","[360, 361, 362, 363]"

Basic clause structure and types of clauses
12.0IntroductionThis chapter describes the basic clause structure and the different clause types
in Kakua. Section §12.1 provides an introductory overview of the minimal
requirements to form a clause. Section §12.2 gives a description of copular
constructions involving predicative and existential copulas. In addition to affirmative
existential copulas, Kakua also has a negative existential copula; this type of negative
existential is described in §12.3. Section §12.4 gives a description of predicative
possession. This is followed by a description of comparative constructions in §12.5,
and non-verbal predicates expressing equation in §12.6. Finally, §12.7 provides a
description of the basic locative constructions.
This chapter concludes with a description of Kakua clause types, presented in
4 subsections: declarative clauses in §12.9; interrogative clauses, both polar and
content interrogatives, in §12.10; imperative clauses in §12.11; and negative
imperative clauses in §12.12. Responses to imperative clauses are described in
§12.13, and a summary is found in §12.14.
12.1Minimal clauseA basic sentence in Kakua is composed of at least one independent clause.
An intransitive clause is minimally composed of a predicate (with optional
indexation of the subject by means of a cross-referencing proclitic), as in (1); or an
optional subject NP and a predicate, as in (2), where the subject NP typically
precedes the predicate (SV). Transitive clauses minimally contain a predicate;
additionally, transitive clauses typically contain an overt object NP (though not
obligatorily); the subject NP is optional, and it may be indexed on the predicate by
means of cross-referencing proclitics (3), which are themselves also optional (see
Chapter 11 for description of criteria governing the occurrence of proclitics). In
transitive clauses, the object NP typically precedes the predicate of the clause (SOV)

12.2The affirmative existential copular verb hɨmThe affirmative existential verb hɨm is used in predicative and existential
copular constructions to encode existence, and also permanent states and attribution,
as discussed in this section. Equative constructions in Kakua use a different strategy,
and are formed by the juxtaposition of the NPs without the use of the existential verb
hɨm (see §12.6 below). Note that the verb hɨm ‘exist’, which is referred to as a copula
here, can function as a predicate on its own, whereas the canonical definition of
copulas expects copulas to not be able to function as predicates on their own right;
see Hengeveld (1992). Examples below illustrate copula constructions in Kakua,
using the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ in its different functions to express permanent
states, existence/location, and attribution:

Kakua does not differ from that shown for other types of verbal constructions
(intransitive, monotransitive, ditransitive), in which the verb is (preferably) in final
position, being preceded by the object and the subject/agent arguments: SOV( cop).
Thus, a copular construction is also preferably of the type SOV. The copular verb in
Kakua takes all of the verbal morphology (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of verbal
morphology). This include interrogative mood (14) and tense and aspect (14)-(17)
(see also the examples above in this section), cross-referencing proclitics,
morphemes indicating evidentiality, as in (16), and nominalizers, as in (17):

inherently negative stative verb wîʔikan denoting the meanings of ‘not to have or not
to exist’. This form can be further analyzed into two morphemes, a verb root wîʔiand the verbal negation suffix –kan. However, the root wîʔi- is obligatorily bound
and cannot occur without the negation suffix –kan, and this verb is thus considered
to be a single negative existential expression. The negative existential verb, like other
Kakua verbs, takes all the verbal morphology available to verbs in general: crossreferencing proclitics (18); TAM affixes (18)-(20), evidentiality prefixes and/or
enclitics (as in (18)-(20)), and derivational suffixes to form adjectives (21):

Additionally, it can form an utterance on its own, and is often sufficient as a
negative response to a question (of the English type ‘no’) as exemplified below:

Although the affirmative existential verb hɨm can also be negated by attaching
the negation suffix -kan to it, Kakua speakers strongly prefer using the negative
existential wîʔikan, when the predicative or existential clause is negative. NegatingBasic clause structure and types of clauses319the verb hɨm (hɨm-kan ‘be/exist-NEG’) with the intended meaning of ‘not exist/not.be’
is qualified by most speakers as odd and is corrected to wîʔikan.
12.4Predicative possession constructionsKakua has two main strategies to express possession. Firstly, the juxtaposition
of the possessor and the possessed NPs, with the possessive marker -ǐʔ suffixed to
the possessor NP for alienable possession, and without the possessive marker for
inalienable possession (see Chapter 5). Secondly, possession can be expressed by
means of a predicative construction (i.e. predicative possession). Predicative
possessive constructions involve the stative possessive verb bibùʔ ‘have/possess’.
The constituent order in predicative possessive constructions is consistent with
Kakua’s preferred SOV order. Thus, the possessor, most often animate, precedes the
possessed NP (usually inanimate), and the verb is at the end of the construction.
Constructions using this verb are illustrated in examples (23)-(26) below:

‘the child has a cold’
As seen in the examples above, the predicative possessive verb ‘have’ bibùʔ
takes the common verbal morphology (e.g., subject cross-reference proclitics, tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality). The possessed NP of a predicative possessive
construction is not case marked, even when DOM criteria apply (see Chapter 6).","[335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340]"

Question-word interrogative clauses elicit specific information (as opposed to
‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers sought in polar questions). Content questions are formed by
using the relevant question word (the question word can occassionally be omitted,
see below). A list of interrogative words (discussed in Chapter 7) is given in Table
12.3. These interrogative words are derived from the interrogative stem de- (see
Chapter 7 for an extensive description of interrogative pronouns and other question
words).

In content interrogatives the question word (whether an interrogative pronoun,

Note that, as illustrated in example (75), content questions can optionally take an
interrogative marker:332A Grammar of Kakua70) dedě=tiʔ

Note one question word dêʔe has two meanings, ‘who’ and ‘where’ (examples
(76)-(78)). Its interpretation is based on inference driven by context. The
interpretation of the question word dêʔe ‘where/who’ as ‘where’ in (82) below, for
example, is inferred by speakers based on context.

Content questions are typically answered with a (declarative) clause, or with
a single word that provides the particular information solicited.
Polar (yes-no) questions can be responded to positively in two ways: with the
̃̂ ‘yes, aha’ (84)-(85) or by repeating in a declarative form the
affirmative particle hɨhɨ
verb phrase that appeared in the interrogative (86)-(87). Subjects are frequently
dropped, as in (84) and (86).

Kakua does not have a dedicated ‘no’ particle. The negative existentialwîʔikan serves as an expression of clausal negation. Alternatively, negation can also
be expressed by the verbal suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’ (for verbal negation).
Either of these two can be used when responding negatively to a question. A
negative response to a polar question can be done by repeating the predicate of the
interrogative clause and adding the negation suffix -kan/-kap (88), or with the clausalBasic clause structure and types of clauses335negative expression wîʔikan (89). A negative response to a content question can
include the expression of negation wîʔikan (89):

interrogative clauses. Content interrogative clauses demand a full declarative clause
as a response, or just an NP.
12.11 Imperative clauses
Imperative clauses in Kakua are formed by reduplication of the last vowel of
the verb root of the predicate of the imperative clause. The reduplicated vowel
receives an obligatory high tone. The imperative suffix is then by default represented
as -Ṽ́ , where the quality of the vowel is the same as that of the last vowel of the
verb root. This is illustrated in examples (90)-(105):
90) ɲi=tɨ ̀j-huj-ú
2PL=be.good-listen-IMP
‘listen carefully!’
91) hemʔ-é
eat-IMP
‘eat!’336A Grammar of Kakua92) wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-á=buhú
1SG=OBJ tell-IMP=DIR
‘tell me’5
Like all Kakua clauses, imperative clauses in Kakua are typically verb-final.
Kakua often omits the overt expression of subject NP arguments (although their overt
expression is considered acceptable by speakers, they judge them to be redundant),
for they are usually referred to by means of cross-referencing proclitics on the verb
predicate. Imperative clauses in Kakua tend to omit the subject argument of the
clause more often than other clauses (a cross-linguistic common characteristic of
imperative clauses; c.f., Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171; Aikhenvald 2010:92-97, and
Chapter 2 of the same book). The omission of the subject argument of the clause
occurs more frequently with 2SG forms than with 2PL forms; however, this omission
can be said to be facultative, since instances of the 2PL where the subject argument
is omitted can also occur when context is sufficient to allow for it. The verb root
plus the imperative marker -Ṽ́, without need of further affixes or clitics, can function
as an imperative clause by itself (also a cross-linguistically common feature of
imperative clauses Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171). If additional TAME distinctions
occur, they form a separate clause. Imperative clauses without an overt proclitic are
interpreted by default as having a second person singular subject (93)-(94). Examples
(95) and (96) illustrate imperatives with overt 2PL and 2SG proclitic pronouns
respectively:
93) fwɨb-ɨ ̃́
return-IMP
‘come back!’
94) ɲaw-á

construction at the end of this section.","[351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357]"
"Basic clause structure and types of clauses325The locative enclitic, as illustrated in the examples above, attaches to the head
noun of the locative NP. The locative-marked NP tends to occur in initial position
(preceding core arguments). However, it can also be seen in the examples above
(e.g., (41) and (44) that an alternative placement of the locative adjunct is possible).
A second set of constructions expressing locative meanings are those
involving a positional verb, in which the verb specifies the location/position of the
nominal. This verb often appears as part of a serial verb construction (see Chapter
9). Constructions of this type do not require the locative marker =bǔ. Examples are
given in (46)-(47) below:

Table §12.1 below gives some examples of positional verbs. A list of
positional verbs can be found in Chapter 8. Note that these verbs express inessive
and adessive locative meanings not expressed by the locative clitic case marker =bǔ.

independent clauses in Kakua. Declarative clauses are described in §12.9, followed
by a section describing interrogative polar and content questions (§12.10). Section
§12.11 provides a description of affirmative imperative clauses and §12.12 of
negative imperatives. These sections show that these types of clauses differ in their
possibility of encoding evidential categories.
All of these clause types have dedicated markers, as given in Table 11.2
below. Additional description and exemplification of these markers are also
presented in other chapters. Chapter 10 on TAME describes the meanings of these
markers in the context of other markers encoding mood, e.g., frustrative, dubitative,
and other moods. Chapter 8 gives a basic template of the verb and describes the
syntactic position of these markers within the verbal word.

12.9Declarative clausesDeclarative clauses in Kakua are those expressing statements (in the sense of
Palmer 2001:65). Declarative clauses are morphologically marked by the clitic =na.
Note, however, that in many cases the declarative marker does not occur. The criteria
predicting the omission, or facultative marking, of the declarative clitic, are left for
future research.
From a formal perspective declarative clauses do not have special
phonological features (like, for example, dedicated intonation, or other phonological
traits to be found exclusively in declarative clauses) nor do they have a special
constituent order. Declarative clauses can express affirmative or negative statements,
as seen in the examples in (48)-(49) below:

12.10 Interrogative clauses12.10.0 Interrogative clauses
Kakua has two main types of interrogative clauses: Content (or questionword) interrogative clauses, and polar (yes-no) interrogative clauses. Content
questions (§12.10.2 below) are formed by using interrogative pronouns or other
interrogative words like interrogative demonstratives and/or adverbials (see Chapter
7 on interrogative pronouns and question words). Polar interrogative clauses
(§12.10.1 below), on the other hand, are morphologically marked by the clitic =nit.
Interrogative clauses contrast with declarative clauses in that the declarative marker
=na does not occur in interrogative clauses. They do not differ from declarative
clauses in word order. Also no particular intonational pattern is required to
exclusively mark interrogative clauses (although in future work intonation patterns
in interrogative clauses should be looked at carefully).. Interrogative clauses can be
both affirmative and negative. When negative, the verbal predicate must be marked
by the negation suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’, or the negative existential wîɁikan ‘not.exist’
is used. Compare the following examples:

that interrogative clauses have not been found to occur with the entire range of
evidentiality distinctions (I have found them occuring only with the inferred
evidential markers). Further research should focus on specifically testing for
acceptance of each of the evidential markers in interrogative clauses and explore the
reasons why some (at least the inferred category) are allowed to occur whereas other
categories are not. Examples (55) above and (58) below illustrate interrogative
clauses occurring with the inferred evidential. It is interesting to note that evidential
markers can occur in interrogative clauses, even though one might think that
evidential marking presupposes assertion.
Additionally, the interrogative marker can also co-occur with the dubitative
mood suffix -hi ‘DUB’ in the same clause, as illustrated in (60) below. See Chapter
10 for further descriptions of interaction of the interrogative mood with evidentiality
and other mood markers.

Polar interrogative clauses and content interrogative clauses differ in that
polar questions must obligatorily be marked with the interrogative mood clitic =nit,
while in interrogative clauses formed with question words, the presence of = nit is
optional, and it is most often omitted.","[345, 346, 347, 348, 349]"
"Basic clause structure and types of clauses337Imperatives can also be used to give commands to other than a 2 nd person
(singular or plural) participants. This is done by adding the appropriate proclitic
pronoun in the imperative construction:
97) mi=Ɂên-é
3SG.F=see=IMP
‘may she see!’
98) mi=têw-é
3SG.F=work=IMP
‘may she work!’
Constituent order in imperative clauses is somewhat different from that in
declarative clauses. Imperative clauses do have a verb final order. But if the subject
argument is fully expressed by an NP, then the subject argument most often
immediately precedes the verb. It then follows the object rather than preceding it as
in other clauses, with an OSV order as the result. The fronting of the object argument
in an imperative clause is not an uncommon cross-linguistic feature of imperatives
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97). This ordering of imperative clauses in Kakua is
illustrated in examples (99)-(101) below:
99) kan=diʔ měm
3SG=OBJ 2SG

clauses in Kakua is the reported evidential =wɨt, possibly together with the prefix
t- ‘EVID’ (prefix of second hand, nonsensorial evidentiality. See Chapter 10 on
evidentiality) to express that the order has been given by someone other than the
speaker. The use of the reported evidential marker usually serves also to attenuate
the force of the command, making it a more polite imperative. This is often used
when directing orders to elders (102)-(103). Note that the additional evidentiality
specification forms a separate clause, so cannot be directly combined with the
imperative verb:338A Grammar of Kakua102) ma=tʃɨd-ɨ ̃́,

itself, and all of these distinctions form a separate clause. Cross-linguistically
speaking, this is not an uncommon characteristic of imperative clauses (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985).
An additional construction expressing imperative solicits the addressee to
perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The form of this imperative is
-áʔbuhú and it is glossed here as ‘IMP2’. In constructions using this morpheme, the
subject is always a second person, and its overt expression may be omitted. See
examples (104)-(105) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’. This
form can only code a ‘beneficial’ imperative, and no other benefactive or dative like
meanings can be drawn from it.

105) kǎn=diʔ ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
3SGM=OBJ take.out-IMP2
‘take (it) out for him’
Synchronically, -áʔbuhú is considered here to be one single morpheme.
However, because of the phonological (syllabic structure, vowel harmony) structure
of Kakua words, it is likely that that -áʔbuhú is historically at least a complex form.
The etymology of this imperative is not transparent.6
It might be a lexicalized combination of a morpheme -áʔ and the directional clitic=buh ‘DIR’.
The first element could be a phonologically reduced form of the negative suffix -kan, or it might
correspond to a morpheme that is no longer used in synchronic Kakua. Note that the negative suffix
doesn’t support a semantic motivation for this ‘beneficial’ imperative. Perhaps, the source of the proposed
first element -áɁ, expressed similar semantics of performing an action on behalf of a third party.
Nonetheless, there is no evidence neither in Kakua nor in its sister language Nɨkak that allows me to
strongly claim this hypothesis. The second element of this form would be the directional clitic =buh
‘DIR’, displaying the addition of a reduplicated vowel and high tone, i.e. the regular way to form
imperatives -Ṽ́. I propose the directional clitic as the most likely source of this element in this imperative
marker because of the semantics of this clitic, which comes from a verb root meaning ‘to perform an
action from a distance’ (see note at the end of Chapter 8 regarding the fuzzy verbal-directional identity
6Basic clause structure and types of clauses33912.12 Negative imperative
Negative imperative clauses require the negative imperative suffix -kabuhú.
This is also clearly a complex morpheme, historically derived from at least two
morphemes. The first part of this morpheme can be identified as the negative suffix
marker -kan/-kap. The second part, however, is less clear, and can have at least two
interpretations. Firstly, it may relate to the directional clitic =buh ‘DIR’, or to the
emphasis function of the clitic =bǔ ‘EMPH’ (see Chapter 8), plus a reduplication of
its vowel. As for now, I have no strong evidence for either of these hypotheses, but
what is clear is that (as with the second imperative described in §12.11 above), given
Kakua’s phonological and morphological rules, this particular negative imperative
morpheme can be considered historically as a complex form.
The negative imperative morpheme must immediately follow the verb root
(to which no affirmative imperative can be attached): (PN)=Verb-kabuhú :
106) ma=ʔɨm-kabuhú
2SG=be.afraid-NEG.IMPER
‘don’t be afraid!’of this morpheme). Thus, performing on behalf, or for the benefit of somebody else can be equated to
performing an action from a distance. Whenever the clause refers to this specific semantics of performing
an action for the benefit of somebody else, the imperative is expressed with this obscure morpheme
-áʔbuhú, thus it is considered here as one single complex morpheme. In constructions using this
morpheme, the subject argument of the clause is always in the second person, and it may be omitted. See
examples (i)-(ii) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’:

take.out-IMP2
‘take (it) out for him’
Since it seems to have a beneficial encoding (perform for the benefit of someone else), the following
considerations might be relevant for a future study of this imperative: i) Kakua does not have a dedicatedmarker for benefactive roles (see discussion in Chapter 6), ii) many Vaupés languages also do not have
dedicated markers for benefactive roles; iii) Kakua does not have a dative case marker (another possiblesource for the development of a benefactive encoding of a form). If the source were a dative case marker,however, it would be necessary to explain why and how a case marker becomes a verbal morpheme; iv)
many Vaupés languages have been described to lack a dative marker; v) Nɨkak, Kakua’s sister language,has been described as making five case distinctions, among which a dative; vi) Kakua, as many of its
neighboring groups in the Vaupés, makes three morphological distinctions, for case: Object arguments,Locatives, and Comitative and Instrumental; vii) Nɨkak’s dative marker is -éʔ (see Mahecha 2009); viii)
there is a regular sound correspondence of Nɨkak /e/ to Kakua /a/. This may be relevant for the complexbenefactive imperative form in Kakua -áʔbuhú; ix) because of Kakua’s phonological (syllabic structure,
vowel harmony) and morphological rules, we know that -áʔbuhú imperative is a complex form.","[357, 358, 359, 360]"

with the same hosts as the declarative marker =na; that is, interrogative =nit can
occur with predicates, as well as with nouns (including pronouns, demonstratives),
and with adjectives. Examples (59)-(62) below illustrate polar interrogative clauses.
Examples (59)-(60) show affirmative polar interrogative clauses. Negative
interrogative clauses are illustrated in (61)-(62):̃̌

Common greetings in Kakua are similar to polar questions, but the
interrogative marker =nit is often omitted in these. These greetings do not elicit
information, as they refer to an action for which the speaker has clear direct evidence
and thus doesn’t require an answer. Note that, since the declarative marker can be
omitted in declarative clauses, the type of clauses presented below can alternatively
be analyzed as declarative clauses. The examples below illustrate a morning greeting
(65) and arrival greetings (66)-(67):330A Grammar of Kakua65) ma=hâ

66) ma=hɨw
2SG=arrive.here
‘have you arrived?’
67) ma=tɨ ̃̂j
2SG=be.good
‘how are you?’ (lit. you good)
Departure greetings do require the interrogative clitic. Example (68)
illustrates the typical greeting directed towards those who are leaving. Again, it does
not elicit information, as it is used even when the process of leaving is taking place
in the presence of the speaker.
68) ma=beh=nit
2SG=go=INTERR
‘are you leaving?’
Another exception to obligatory marking with the interrogative clitic =nit in
polar questions occurs in traditional Kakua storytelling. This practice requires one
or more “responders” whose role in the event is to respond to the person telling the
story. The response often consists of repeating the last sentence of the main narrator.
This “response” can be understood as a question,4 but the interrogative marker =nit
is not required. Example (69) below comes from a story-telling event of a folktale.
Speaker A is telling the story, and speaker B is the designated “responder”. His or
her duty is to ask questions to the speaker while the story is being told. Speaker B
asks the questions without using the interrogative marker =nit. When inquired about
this, speakers reported that everybody assumes that the denominated “responder” is
asking questions, and therefore the use of the interrogative marker =nit was
considered redundant (although possible):4I assume this because it is the only accepted translation that speakers give, and also because themain narrator gives an affirmative answer. Also, when having conversations in Spanish with me, theKakua speakers will use the same formula, though in Spanish they will use the interrogative intonation to
indicate that the repetition of the sentence said by one of the speakers represents a ‘rhetorical question’,
or just a figure of speech.","[349, 350, 351]"
"110
c)3.3A Grammar of Kakua
Morphologically, most of Kakua’s morphology is expressed through verbal
morphemes in the verb phrase. Morphological marking of tense, aspect, mood,
voice and other elements, like polarity, all occur in the verb phrase.","[131, 132]"

Another example of a morpheme that occurs in different positions is the samesubject morpheme –nit/=nit. Although this morpheme occurs predominantly in
position 8 (as presented in Table 8.4), I have found a few instances in the corpus in
which the same-subject marker occurs after the assertion mood enclitic, as in (16).
It is not clear why the same-subject morpheme occurs in this position in these
examples:
16) bɨ ́dʔ-tû=ka=nit

‘he arrived and stopped, and held (the panflute) vertically (against his body)’
I will proceed now to illustrate the use of some morphemes in each of the
slots shown in Table 8.4.
Position 1: Proclitics
Kakua (virtually always) indexes the subject argument of the clause by means
of cross-referencing proclitics (see Chapter 6 for description of subject indexing on
the verb and exceptions to its obligatoriness, and Chapter 11 on alignment). These
proclitics agree in number and person with the subject argument of the clause, and
also in gender for 3rd person singular subjects (often no overt subject NP is needed).
Example in (17) below illustrates the use of a 1st person singular subject proclitic
with no overt subject noun phrase:
17) baj-ni-bit
wã=hêjʔ
be.small-ADJVZ-DIM 1SG=know
‘I know a little bit’
Position 2: Prefixes: evidentiality
Prefixes encoding evidential and aspectual meanings occur in the second slot
of the verb word. These prefixes cannot occur without a preceding proclitic. One of
these second position prefixes t-/ti- encodes secondhand evidentiality, expressingThe verb: morphology and structure247that the statement was not sensed, directly heard, or witnessed by the speaker. This
evidential prefix often occurs together with the reported evidential enclitic in the
same word (see Chapter 10 for the description of evidentiality in Kakua). An example
is given in (18):ʔã=ti-beh-ep=wɨt=hĩ

18) tʃèj kãk
night
person 3SG.M=EVID-go-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST LONG.AGO
‘Long ago, a person went out at night (it is said)’
Other meanings that are expressed by prefixes occurring in this slot are:
inferred evidentiality t-/ta-, as illustrated in (19) and (20); habitual aspect, as in (21);
and non-visual evidentiality (see examples in Section §10.6).̂ ã=diʔ

3PL=HAB-tell-NEG=REC.PST
1SG=OBJ
‘They didn’t tell me’ (I assume since they usually don't tell me)
Position 3: Prefix: reciprocal and reflexive
Position 3 can be filled only with the reflexive/reciprocal prefix mǐk-. This
reflexive/reciprocal prefix can fill the pre-stem position required by verb words
without needing to be preceded by a proclitic. Example (22) below illustrates the
reflexive/reciprocal prefix being preceded by a proclitic (position 1) and an inferred
evidential prefix (position 2):
22) ʔĩ=t-mǐk-pâʔ-ap=hĩ
3PL=INF.EVID-RFLX/REC-break.in.half-PST=REM.PST
‘They broke themselves apart’ (they took different paths by themselves)
The prefix mǐk- ‘RFLX/REC’ in Kakua is the only morpheme that changes the
valency of the verb to which it attaches. It serves to encode both reflexive and
reciprocal meanings. These are illustrated in (23) for the reciprocal meaning, and
(24) for the reflexive meaning of the prefix:248A Grammar of Kakua23) fĩ=mǐk-fwãʔ=na=ka
1PL= RFLX/REC-find=DECL=ASS
‘We meet each other, my relative!’ʔinwɨʔá

tree-CL:pointed=COM 3SG.F=EVID-RFLX-hit/whip-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
‘she whipped herself with a vein (it’s said)’
Whether this prefix expresses reciprocal or reflexive depends on the context.
With a singular subject, as in example (25) (see also example (24)), a reciprocal
reading is not possible. Verbs with plural subjects, as in (26), on the other hand, can
have either a reciprocal or a reflexive meaning. The context determines the
interpretation as either one or the other:

ʔĩ=t-mík-bûd=be
3PL
3PL=EVID-RECIP-cut=REC.PST
‘they cut each other’ or ‘they cut themselves’
Verbs that include the reflexive/reciprocal prefix can drop the subject proclitic
if reference is sufficiently clear from the context, like with other verb forms. This is
illustrated in (27) below:
27) victor-ĩʔ
Victor-POSSmik-wěʔe=namɨ=bǔ=hĩhouse=LOC=REM.PSTREFL/RECIP-chat=DECLfĩ=hɨm-ɨp=hĩ1PL=exist-PST=REM.PSTfĩ=tʃãhãp=hĩ1PL=PROG=REM.PST
‘we were at Victor’s house, chatting (among ourselves)’Additionally, the reflexive/reciprocal prefix can have a use different from the
encoding of reciprocal or reflexive meaning. Instead, it can have an intensifying use,
similar to ‘self’ in English. This is illustrated in the following example:
28) ma=mǐk-wẽp-hâ=na
2SG=RFLX/RECIP-be.strong-wake.up=DECL
‘eat your breakfast yourself’
Position 5: Suffixes: imperatives
Position 5 can be filled by affirmative imperative -V́, the negative imperative
-kabuhú, and the imperative on the benefit of someone else -Ɂabuhú. The differentThe verb: morphology and structure249imperative suffixes in this slot cannot co-occur. Examples in (29) and (30) illustrate
verbs inflected for imperative mood (for more examples of imperatives, including
the imperative for the benefit of someone else, see Chapter 12):
29) ma=jàp-ʧɨ ̂jʔ-beh-é
2SG=pass-step.on-go-IMP
‘walkǃ’
30) ma=tîw-kabuhú
2SG=play-NEG.IMP
‘Don’t play!’
Note that both the imperative and the negative imperative suffixes occur in
final position in the examples presented above. I do not have evidence in my corpus
to tell whether these suffixes can occur together with other suffixes or if their position
is later within the template.
Position 6. Suffixes: general past, immediate future, and distant future
Position 6 is filled by suffixes indicating tense distinctions (past, and future).
These morphemes are all mutually exclusive. Examples (31)-(32) illustrate these
suffixes. The different tense markers are further described in Section §10.1:
31) wã=ʔip
kaʔ-bit
ʔã=hɨw

1SG=ASS 1SG=pray.on-FUT
‘I will pray (make a prayer)’
Position 7: Suffix: negation
Position 7 is filled only with the negation suffix -kan/-kap as illustrated in
(33) and (34) below. Example (34) shows how the negation marker occurs after the
general past tense suffix that occurs in position 6:
33) kǎn=diʔ wã=pĩ-dɨw-kan=hĩ
3SG=OBJ 1SG=HAB-carry-NEG=REM.PST

3SG.M=EVID-scream-grow-PST-NEG=EVID=REC.PST
‘maybe he didn’t scream’250A Grammar of KakuaPosition 8: Suffix: Subordinator
The subordination marker (described in more detail in Chapter 13) occurs
suffixed in position 8, preceding dubitative and desiderative suffixes (position 9), the
frustrative enclitic (position 10), and the declarative mood marker =na and the
interrogative mood marker =nit (position 11). Note that the subordinator suffix –ni
~ -nit, is homophonous with various other forms in Kakua: same subject clitic =nit,
interrogative =nit, adjectivizer –ni, agent nominalization –ni, and the collective
plural marker –nit.
Examples (35)-(36) below provide illustrations of the use of the subordinator
suffix. A more extensive description of this subordinator suffix (and the type of

Position 9: Suffixes: mood
Slot 9 of the verb word is filled by the dubitative suffix. Dubitative is
illustrated in (37):
37) ʔĩ=t-hěmʔ-hip=tagǎ
3PL=EVID-eat-DUB=INF.EVID
‘perhaps they ate (it looks like it)’
The dubitative marker frequently co-occurs with evidentiality markers (most
commonly with the inferred evidential marker. See Chapter 10 for the description of
the evidentiality system), and also with the frustrative marker (see example (41)
below).","[267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272]"
"10.4.2 Interrogative mood =nit
The interrogative marker in Kakua serves to express questions (polar
questions, see Chapter 12 section §12.10 for the description of polar and content
questions). An interrogative implies a “non-assertion” (see Palmer 2001:52-53), and
as a type of illocution, it represents an ‘unqualified question’ without necessarily
implying the speaker’s commitment, attitudes or even expectations towards the
answer. The interrogative marker is mutually exclusive with declarative and
imperative illocution markers.
The interrogative marker in Kakua is the clitic =nit ‘INTER’, and although its
most common host is the predicate (verb; as in Table 10.3 above), as in example
(53), the interrogative marker can also attach to other parts of speech such as
pronouns (54), nominalized or adjectivized verbs (55), or NPs (56):

do not undertake here a discussion of the differences between quotative and reportative evidentiality,
given that there is no distinction between these two in Kakua.
9286A Grammar of KakuaThe interrogative illocution can be combined with other modality markers,
like the dubitative, as in the following example.10
57) ma=beh-hin-kan=nit
2SG=go-DUB-NEG=INTERR
‘aren’t you going?’
Unlike declaratives, the interrogative marker can occur in clauses marked with
inferred evidentiality:
58) měm
ma=ta-naʔa-beh=ta=nit
2SG
2SG=EVID-want-go=INF.EVID=INTERR
‘maybe you want to go?’
Interrogative clauses, and how responses to them are formed, are further
described in Chapter Section §12.10.
10.4.3 Imperative mood: –Ṽ́ ‘IMP’, -kabuhú ‘NEG.IMP’, and -ʔabuhú ‘IMP2’
The last category of illocution is the imperative mood. The imperative mood
expresses commands. Commands in Kakua can be expressed by three different
markers that encode specific types of commands. A positive command, which is
marked with the suffix -Ṽ́, a negative command, marked with the suffix -kabuhú,
and a command that solicits an action to be performed for the benefit of someone
else, marked with the suffix -ʔabuhú.
Like declarative and interrogative moods, the imperative moods can serve
to form types of clauses. The host of the imperative suffixes is the predicate (or verb
as in Table 10.3). Examples of these three imperative markers are given below:
59) kan=diʔ měm
3SG=OBJ 2SG
‘leave it!’ma=fwẽh-é2SG=leave-IMP60) ma=beh-kabuhú
ʔĩ=pĩ-nih=na=wɨt=hĩ

61) kǎn=diʔ
ʔɨ ̃̂b-áʔbuhú
3SGM=OBJ
take.out-IMP2
‘take it out (for somebody else)’
Note that, unlike the interrogative, the dubitative modality does not express a question, given
that the category of modality, as adopted here from Hengeveld (2004), does not have the ability to form
clause types. A question is a type of clause, whereas the dubitative modality expresses doubt, and not
necessarily a question. See the description on dubitative modality in §10.5.1 below.
10Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality287Usually additional modality (and tense and aspect) distinctions are not
expressed in imperative clauses. Whenever the clause is further specified for these
distinctions, the TAME markers occur on another element of the clause, which can
take all of the needed TAME morphology:

"320A Grammar of Kakua12.5Comparative constructionsThe function of comparative constructions in Kakua is to assign the relative
position of two referents on a predicative scale. Comparative constructions,
according to the terminology used in Stassen (1985), involve the following elements:
the standard of comparison (the NP indicating the object that serves as the yardstick
of the comparison); the comparee (the object that is being compared); the parameter
(the property on which the comparison is based), and the index (referring to the type
of comparison). The last two, i.e. the parameter and the index, are referred to as the
scale.
Kakua comparative constructions include those in which the scale of
comparison expresses standards referred to as being less than, more than, and equal
to the compared entity. In these types of constructions, the scale is expressed by verb
roots, without additional TAME morphology, affixes or proclitics. In these cases, the
verb root by itself indicates the scale of comparison. Examples (27)-(29) illustrate
the use of the verb tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’ not functioning as a predicate, but as a scale for
comparison. The order of constituents in comparative constructions is as follows: the
comparee precedes the standard, and the position of the scale of comparison (e.g.,
tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’) is free.

comparison meaning ‘be less than’. Note that in these examples, as in (27)-(29) above
and (30) below, the verb expressing the scale for comparison does not take additional
TAM affixes and its function within the clause is not that of a predicate, but of a
scale of comparison:Basic clause structure and types of clauses

be.alike this.F
‘like this short, the younger brother was shorter (than the older ones), just like
Chavela’
Semblative comparison, in which the standard and the comparee are
conceived to be of equal degree on a given scale, are formed by using different
particles encoding meanings such as ‘be alike’, ‘like this’, ‘and so like this’, ‘be
equal’, ‘be similar to’. Choosing one particle or another depends primarily on
whether or not the speaker can physically signal the relative dimension of the
standard of comparison, and on the physical proximity of the speaker to the standard
of comparison. For example, if the speaker points to a tree in the distance as the
yardstick for comparison of height, then the particle paniʔna ‘and so like this’ (or its
shortened allomorph panʔ) would be used. This particle is also used whenever the
standard of comparison is not visually accessible. If instead the speaker physically
touches the yardstick of comparison, or uses gestures to indicate its dimensions, then
most often the particle mɨn ‘be equal’ is used.
Example (30) above, highlights the use of particles mɨn ‘be equal’, and paʔniʔ
‘be alike/be like this’. During the utterance of the first line in the example, the
speaker was indicating how short the younger brother is with a hand gesture, by
placing one hand below with the palm of the hand facing upwards, and the other
hand higher up with its palm facing downwards. In this case the speaker uses the
particle mɨn ‘be equal’. Then, the speaker pointed at Chavela (a young girl listening
to the conversation), expressing that ‘the younger brother’ in the tale was about her
size; for this comparison the speaker uses the particle paʔniʔ ‘be alike/be like this’.
Additional examples of semblative comparatison are given in (31)-(33) below.
A further description of Kakua’s particles, including the ones occurring within
comparative constructions, can be found in Chapter 3.

The superlative, describing a situation in which the comparee has the highest
degree among the standards of comparison, is expressed by using the noun niʔat
‘all/everything’, as in (34), or by using an emphasizing construction, as in (35),
where the nominalized verb jǔb ‘be true’ serves to express that the referent of the
noun keh ‘fish’ is the biggest among the referents of the standard of comparison
noun bita ‘others’. These examples additionally illustrate that the noun phrase
expressing the standard can be case-marked. Maybe this indicates that the standard
is regarded as a syntactic object. There is no explanation why it is that sometimes
comparees are object marked while other times they are not (the animacy hierarchy
governing DOM does not seem to predict object marking in these cases).

(36)-(39) below illustrate verbless clauses:

Note that an alternative analysis of these constructions may seem to be that
the copula has been omitted, i.e. as ‘zero copula’ construction. According to the
standard definition of copula constructions (Hengeveld 1992, Pustet 2003, and
especially Stassen 1994), a ‘zero copula’ type of construction presupposes that there
is a syntactic slot that is otherwise filled by another element, or in which a copula
occurs optionally under certain grammatical criteria. The examples shown in this
subsection, however, are not considered here as copula constructions with a zero
copula, because it is not the case that in these constructions a syntactic slot remains
empty in a restricted context, while alternating with an overt copula in some other
contexts. The examples presented in this section do not have alternatives with an
overt copula.
Additionally, the simple juxtaposition of related elements in Kakua is a very
common strategy to express many different types of relations (e.g., derivation of
nouns Chapter 5, possession Chapter 5, coordination of clauses Chapter 13). It should
not be surprising then that expressing these more ‘permanent’ states of being (as
opposed to the less permanent states of being illustrated in the examples in section
§12.2) also appeal to the juxtaposition of elements as a way to express these more
permanent states of being.
12.7Basic locative constructionsA basic locative construction (or BLC), as defined in Levinson and Wilkins
(2006:15), is a type of construction that predominantly “occurs in response to a
Where-question”. There are two different options for expressing locative relations in324A Grammar of KakuaKakua. One is by means of the locative clitic =bǔ,1 the other by means of positional
verbs (of which Kakua has an extensive set). This section describes these two types
of basic locative construction. Further information on the locative marker =bǔ and
its functions is found in Chapter 6 on grammatical relations and case marking.
Chapter 8 provides more information on the semantics of positional verbs in the
context of the description of Kakua verbs.
The locative marker =bǔ serves to express a variety of locative meanings,
among them allative ‘to/into’ and ablative ‘from’. Positional verbs cover inessive
‘in’, and adessive ‘on’ locative meanings. Examples (40)-(45) below illustrate the
stative locative, and the allative and ablative locative meanings expressed by the
locative clitic =bǔ :2

imperative clauses respectively. Negation is also described in Chapter 12).
In the characterization of the morphological markers of illocution, Hengeveld
notes that “by their very nature, basic illocutions [this is declarative, interrogative
and imperative, KB] are restricted to independent sentences and quotations. This
feature will be of help in distinguishing illocutionary from modal categories”
(Hengeveld 2004:1191). This is, however, not a characteristic of the morphological
markers of illocution in Kakua, for these markers are not restricted to independent
clauses and may occur in subordinate clauses (see example (47) below, and Chapter
13, for examples of declarative marker occurring in subordinated clauses).
The different markers of illocution mood in Kakua are summarized in Table
10.3 below.

"10.2.1 Habitual aspect: prefix pĩThe verbal prefix pĩ- encodes habitual aspect. Semantically, it refers to an
event or situation that occurs habitually or frequently for an extended period of time.
The semantics of this prefix conforms to the general definition of habituality, as
given in Comrie (1976:27f): “the feature that is common to all habituals […], is that
they describe a situation which is characteristic of an extended period of time, so
extended in fact that the situation referred to is viewed not as an incidental property
of the moment but, precisely, as a characteristic feature of a whole period.”
Sentences marked with the habitual prefix are translated with the similar habitual
adverb in English ‘usually’, or ‘always’. Some examples follow:Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality27527) niʔat=diʔ
wã=pĩ-hêjʔ-kan=ka
every=OBJ
1SG=HAB-know-NEG=ASS
‘I usually don’t know’
28) wã=pĩ-ʔɨm=na=ka
1SG=HAB-be.afraid=DECL=ASS
‘I’m always afraid’
Perhaps related to what its semantics encodes, indicating that something
occurs in an extended period of time, the habitual prefix in Kakua also implies some
level of assumption by the speaker. For example, although its main semantics is that
of habituality, the speaker expresses a certain attitude towards the veracity of the
proposition when using the habitual prefix. In other words, because the habitual
prefix conveys that a given situation usually occurs in a certain predictable way, the
speaker is also encoding a degree of confidence towards the content of the
proposition, because she assumes that, given the habituality of the situation, it is
assumed to occur (or have occurred), as is being stated.
Perhaps because of this, the habitual prefix does not co-occur with the
reported or the inferred category of evidentials, since its implication of assumption
would be incompatible with inferred or reported meanings. Inferred or reported
evidentialities do not imply that the proposition occurs as such ‘in the majority of
cases’ (Dahl 1985).1 An ‘assumed-like’ encoding, on the other hand, will imply that
the assumption is being made on the basis of a regularity, or ordinary occurrence of
a situation in such a way that it leads to assume or express the habituality of such a
situation. In other words, the habituality of the situation makes that situation
predictable.
Note that the habitual prefix in Kakua does not necessarily encode that the
proposition must always be true, or that things always happens as is being stated. It
is an unasserted assumption that the stated preposition habitually occurs as such.
Perhaps this also explains why it is that the habitual prefix can cooccur with the
assertion (illocution) mood marker. Given that by using the assertion mood marker
the speaker full asserts the situation being expressed (see the description of the
semantics of the marker of assertion in Kakua in §10.5.3 below), the habitual marker
can be said to be also compatible with a ‘real’ world assertion (examples of the cooccurrence of habitual and assertion markers can be seen in (27) and (28) above and
(29) below).
The habitual prefix expresses propositions anchored to non-future tenses. The
explanation behind this can be that it would be rather difficult to predict that an event
Here I follow Dahl’s (1985:96f) definition of habitual aspect as a category of which the use
“indicates that what is expressed in the sentence took place in the majority of those occasions”.
Note also that although the habitual marker, as presented here, includes some kind of evidential
meaning, it doesn’t strictly convey a default ‘assumption’. The habitual prefix encodes primarily
habituality, and it shouldn’t exclude or be incompatible with an evidential specification.

"9.1Serial verb constructionsSerial verb constructions (henceforth SVCs) are constructions consisting of
two or more verb roots in sequence such that they represent one single clause. In
such a construction, there should be no other element (grammatical nor lexical) in
between the verb roots.
Haspelmath (2014) has proposed a series of descriptive generalizations for
SVCs across languages. Loosely following these, I propose in the following list the
defining properties specific to SVCs in Kakua:
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
v)
vi)Components of a SVC in Kakua may not be negated separately .
Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same tense value and may not be
given different tense values individually.
Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same aspectual value and may not
be given different aspectual values individually.
Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same mood value and may not be
given different mood values individually.
Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same evidentiality value and may
not be given different evidentiality values individually.
Components of a SVC in Kakua share the same argumentsI proceed now to provide examples in order to illustrate each of these
properties of SVCs in Kakua:
i)Components of a SVC in Kakua may not be negated separately :The scope of negation in Kakua is the entire clause, and no element smaller
than a clause may be negated. In SVCs then, the scope of negation runs over allVerb serialization259elements (all verbs and other morphology) within the SVC, rather than over one
single verb of the SVC. See examples (4)-(5) below:1

‘I don’t know, don’t talk’If one verb of the construction were to be negated separately, the resulting
interpretation of the utterance changes drastically. Compare (4) above to the elicited
variant in (6) below:

‘you don’t know, can (you) pass to the other side (if you go) underneath me?’Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same tense value and may not be
given different tense values individually.ii)The tense suffixes in Kakua are past –Vp, immediate future –min, and general
future –bip (see also Chapter 8 for verb morphology in Kakua and Chapter 10 on
tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality). These markers are always suffixed closest to
the verb root of the clause (see Chapter 8 for a full template of verb morphology). If
in a SVC, the tense suffix will attach to the last verb root in the construction.
Crucially, the scope of tense is over the entire set of serialized verbs. See examples
(7)–(8) below:

The construction in Kakua, however, is conceived as a SVCeven though the translation in English fails to express this. Negating each of the verbs in the constructionseparately would require the overt marking of the negation suffix -kan to occur on each of the verb stems

Introduction: Kakua and its speakers
1.0IntroductionKakua is an Amazonian language spoken in the linguistic area of the Vaupés,
in Northwest Amazonia, eastern Colombia (the Ethnologue/ISO 639-3 code for
Kakua is cbv; the WALS code is cac).
The language is a member of the small Kakua-Nɨkak language family.1 Its
speakers live in inland forest settlements. Two main settlements are home to most of
Kakua’s approximately 250 speakers. The largest of these two settlements is
Wacará2, with 183 individuals.3 Wacará is located between the Vaupés and the
Querarí Rivers in Colombian territory approximately 100 kilometers to the east of
Mitú, near the Brazilian border (see Map 1 below).
The second bigger Kakua settlement is Nuevo Pueblo, which is an inland
forest village between the Vaupés and the Papurí rivers. The number of inhabitants
of this village is approximately 40 ~ 45 individuals.
About 10-15 other speakers of Kakua live scattered either in villages inhabited
by speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages (a neighboring language family), or on
their own in remote interfluvial settlements.
The present work undertakes a grammatical description of the Kakua
language. The description is based mainly on dialects spoken in the Kakua village
of Wacará. Kakua is divided into two main dialect areas (see §1.6 below), in each of
these areas, there are some clan-specific varieties.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"
"106A Grammar of KakuaOnly nouns can be possessed (alienable/inalienable possession. Possession is
described in Chapter 5). Example in (29) below illustrates possession on a
nominalized verb. Example (30) shows possession on a noun:

The strategy for negation in nouns differs from that of verbs in that verbal
negation is marked with the negation suffix -kan, while the negation of nouns is
expressed through existential negation,3 as in (31):
31) kět webit wîʔi-kan
yegěʔ wîʔi-kan
3PL child
not.exist-NEG
clothes not.exist-NEG
‘They don’t have children and don’t have clothes’
It is also an exclusive characteristic of nouns that they can be modified by
numerals, or take quantifiers. Additionally, numerals and quantifiers can themselves
function as head of noun phrases.
Finally, noun compounding is a productive strategy in Kakua of derivation or
to express possessive relations. Noun compounding is described in Chapter 5.
The following list summarizes the main properties of nouns in Kakua.
Properties summarized in (a)-(c) are exclusive to nouns; these properties also apply
to derived nouns, but the underived noun roots are most relevant for establishing the
difference between word classes. Properties summarized in (d) and (e) are properties
shared between nouns and verbs.
a)Semantically: they refer to human beings, places, things, animate & inanimate
entities, abstract notions
b) Syntactically: nouns function as heads of noun phrases. Noun phrases can
function as arguments. Inflection for case occurs only on the noun phrase and
on adjectives, and on verbs only when they are functioning a complements (see
Chapter 13 on complement clauses).
c) Morphologicallyː there is a smaller repertoire of bound morphology that can
combine with nouns than the repertoire of morphology that combines with verbs.
The morphology of nouns includes the marking of number, shape and/or case.
Nouns do not take prefixes.
3Negation, both verbal and existential negation, is described in chapter 12.","[127, 128]"
"10.6 Evidentiality
10.6.0 Introduction
In this section I present the complex evidentiality system of Kakua, which
differentiates between visual, non-visual, inferred, assumed and reported
evidentiality.
In Kakua, the different evidentiality-marking morphemes serve to indicate a
number of ways in which the speaker relates to the proposition. Whether or not the
speaker is revealing a commitment to the veracity of the proposition is less relevant
than is expressing the source from which the speaker presents the proposition. In
other words, although it is true that evidential markers reveal “the extent to which
the speaker is committed to the truth of the proposition”, as in Bybee et al.’s
(1994:179) definition of epistemic modality, indicating the source of information (as
in Aikhenvald 2004:3 definition of evidentiality) seems to be the primary meaning
of Kakua’s evidentiality markers. Thus, I assume here that evidentiality in Kakua
serves to express information source, though it may also imply epistemic modality.
The latter is, however, not its primary function, given that evidentiality in Kakua can
also, but not exclusively so, encode the commitment of the speaker towards the
validity of the proposition. In this sense, the primary function of evidentiality in
Kakua is to provide information source, and only optionally it can also provide a
truth value of the proposition (epistemic modality).
The different markers encoding evidentiality, and their semantics and
morphosyntactic hosts, are summarized in Table 10.5.",[314]
"264A Grammar of Kakua9.4Serial verb constructions versus coordination of clausesAlthough many examples of SVCs are translated as coordinated constructions
in English (and Spanish as well), SVCs and coordination are clearly formally
different in Kakua. While SVCs present a string of verb roots having the same tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality values (TAME henceforth), and negation values marked
only once, coordination in Kakua is formed by the juxtaposition of verbs, where each
verb represents a coordinated event and is marked separately for TAME and negation
values.
See examples (21)-(25) below on coordinated constructions, and compare
these to those shown for SVCs throughout the previous subsection. Note that each
coordinated event takes TAME or negation individually, even when the values are
the same for the entire construction. Example (21) shows a sequence of coordinated
events. Note that each predicate bears its own marking. Verb roots are given in
boldface:

‘(The firefly) fell inside (the firewood) and let out smoke and it lit the fire’
Similarly, consider the examples in (22)–(23) below, illustrating coordination
constructions, in which the SVC clauses are marked individually for TAME. Note
that although the subject argument is not indexed in both predicates of the two
coordinated SVCs in examples in (22) and (23) (because of discourse related criteria,
see Chapter 6), unless specified with different or same subject markers, the
coordinated predicates share the same argument:

Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality
10.0 Introduction
Situating an event or state in time, both externally and internally (via
expression of tense and aspect, c.f., Comrie 1976, 1985; Dahl 1985; Bhat 1999;
Timberlake 2007), and expressing the different perspectives of the speaker toward
the event (via expression of mood, c.f. Bhat 1999; Hengeveld 2004; Timberlake
2007), is achieved in Kakua by verbal morphemes. Some of these can also occur
with other hosts, as will be indicated below for each of the morphemes.
This chapter deals with the description of the semantics encoded in the
different morphemes that serve to express the speaker’s attitudes towards events or
states, and the general means to express location in time in Kakua. The meanings
involved are treated under the headings of tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality
(henceforth TAME).
Tense distinctions are described in §10.1. The general characteristics of
aspectual distinctions in Kakua are described in §10.2. The categories of mood are
described in §10.3. Section §10.4 and §10.5 focus on the specific characteristics of
illocution and modality, respectively. Finally, evidentiality is dealt with in section
§10.6 of this chapter.","[284, 285, 286, 287, 288]"
"Introduction: Kakua and its speakers3The morphology of Kakua is highly agglutinative (especially in its verbal
morphology), with a combination of head and dependent marking. The language is
predominantly suffixing, with a few prefixes occurring exclusively on the verb.
Kakua has cross-referencing proclitics that agree in person and number with the
Subject/Agent argument of the clause. Third person singular referents have,
additionally, gender agreement of feminine or masculine. Roots are often
compounded to form new words.
Parts of speech in Kakua can be divided into open classes (nouns and verbs),
and closed classes (adjectives, adverbs, numerals, interjections, and other particles).
Kakua nominal categories include number, classifiers, diminutive and
augmentative distinctions, and case marking. Nominalization is a highly productive
strategy to derive nouns from verbs. Animacy is particularly relevant for the system
of differential object marking and differential number marking. There are no
prefixing positions in the noun template, unless additional derivational processes
have been applied (Chapter 4).
Nouns can be further subdivided into alienable and inalienable classes, as
is evident from the system of possession marking (Chapter 5).
Most of Kakua morphology occurs in the verbal construction. There, prefixes,
suffixes and enclitics encode all of the tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality (TAME)
distinctions (clitics conveying TAME distinctions can also occur on other word
classes). Likewise, valency changing morphemes, verbal negation, cross-referencing
proclitics, and many markers of discourse also occur in the verb construction. Verb
roots can group together in a very productive grammatical strategy of verb
serialization.
Kakua’s most common constituent order is verb-final (S)OV, although other
orders are also allowed. It has a nominative-accusative alignment system.","[24, 25]"

sequencing of events is tɨtimaʔ ‘then’. In example (45) below the adverbial particle
links a nominalized subordinate clause (see below) to a main clause:

‘Today I’m better, after she gave (me) her medicine, I am better finally’
Additionally, Kakua has a set of other adverbial particles (see Chapter 3,
section §3.3.6 on adverbs) that can serve as temporal adverbial linkers between a
main clause and a subordinate clause.

Purpose adverbial clauses can take the potential morpheme pînaɁ ‘POT’.
Unlike the other subordinate clauses, purpose adverbial subordinate clauses follow
the main clause. The potential morpheme pînaɁ ‘POT’ does not have any evident
etymological source. The fact, however, that it forms adverbial clauses that are
different from all other ones in that they follow the main clause, may suggest a
historic development of pînaɁ ‘POT’ that is different from other Kakua particles.

Also in the absence of adverbial particles, the nominalization of the predicate
of the subordinate clause is used in Kakua as a type of adverbial subordination to
describe a result or a process together with its result. Note that nominalization is a
common strategy that South American languages use to create subordinate clauses
(van Gijn et al. 2011:3). In Kakua, nominalizations can function in the same way as
other subordinate clauses, where the adverbial subordinate clause precedes the main
clause being modified. The subject of the nominalized verb is also the subject of the
superordinate clause. Examples are given below:̌ ʔɨ=tʃaʔ

A causal relation between two events can be expressed in Kakua by a
predicate construction with the verb root hîb. The use of this verb to express a causal
relation seems to be falling out of use, and only a few older people still use this verb
with a meaning such as ‘do as a consequence of’. Some speakers reported still
knowing and using this verb with such a meaning; however, they still attributed the
correct use of this verb to the older generation. Also, while in an elicitation session
with an elderly speaker, the young men accompanying the session would inquire
about the meaning of hîb when used by the older speaker. The following example
illustrates an instance where the verb hîb is used to express a causal relation:

‘Since he fell asleep, the jaguar ate him’
Younger speakers make use of some of the adverbial strategies in order to
construct causal relations, but more often by linking clauses via bare verb roots
(described in 13.4 above), resulting in constructions like the elicited example in (52)
below:
52) ʔã=t-ʔɨw-ɨp=be
3SG.M=EVID-sleep-PST=REC.PST,ʔã=t-hěmʔ-ep=wɨt=beʔɨwɨsleephiwjaguarkǎn=diʔ3SG.M=OBJ3SG.M=EVID-eat=REP.EVID=REC.PST

ate him)368 A Grammar of Kakua13.9 SummaryKakua has different mechanisms of expressing the relation between events:
i)
ii)
iii)Verb serialization, which serves to express events that are
conceptually integrated into a bigger event (described in Chapter 9)
and which is not a combination of clauses,
coordination, which serves to express a symmetrical relationship
among different independent clauses (described in §13.1 in the
present chapter),
subordination, which expresses a dependent relationship among the
combined clauses (described from §13.2 onwards in the present
chapter).","[385, 386, 387, 388, 389]"

A few examples above have illustrated the declarative occuring with the
marker of assertion =ka (e.g., (46), (48), and (50)), this serves to illustrate how
clauses with the illocution marker for declarative can be further specified for
modality.
Likewise, the declarative marker can also occur in sentences marked with the
reported evidential. This is the only evidential category with which the declarative
can co-occur (be it marked by the reportative enclitic =wɨt ‘REP.EVID’, or with the
second-hand evidential prefix t- ~ ti- ‘EVID’, as long as the sentence represents
reported information. Sentences of inferred evidentiality cannot contain the
declarative marker.8 See §10.6 below for a description of the different evidentiality
distinctions). The following examples illustrate the occurrence of the declarative in
reportative sentences:
51) kět=diʔ

‘She asked them, where are you all going?’
I believe that one possible explanation for this is that perhaps the inferred evidentiality category
reduces somehow the degree of assertion of a situation. The situation is more likely to be asserted if the
speaker has either full commitment towards the veracity of it, or if the commitment towards the veracity
of the situation falls completely onto someone else. Thus, if the sentence is marked for reported
evidentiality, the responsibility of what is being asserted is not entirely on the speaker’s behalf, but on
somebody else’s. An inferred statement, on the other hand, implies the speaker’s own inferences as regards
the situation and may compromise her reputation if the situation is asserted based on inferred grounds.
This may also serve as another argument suggesting that the declarative marker has some kind of
evidential function.

The ability of the declarative marker to occur in reportative sentences is

environments in which a declarative marker can occur. 9 More discussion of
declarative clauses is found in Chapter 12.","[304, 305, 306]"
"Chapter 3
Types of morphemes and word classes
3.0IntroductionThis chapter presents an overview of the major word classes in Kakua. These
are divided into open classes and closed classes of words. The defining grammatical
features of these word classes are established by syntactic, semantic, and
morphological criteria. The word classes in Kakua include nouns, verbs, a small set
of adjectives, a small group of adverbs, a group of particles, and a large number of
grammatical, bound morphemes.
The intricateness of Kakua’s grammar is due, for the most part, to its
morphological complexity. Kakua morphology is highly affixing; most affixes are
post-stem (suffixes), as is characteristic of the languages spoken in the Vaupés
linguistic area (c.f., Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999, Payne 1990, Aikhenvald 2002b,
2012). Prefixing occurs in the verb phrase only and the number of prefixes in Kakua
is far less than that of suffixes (see Chapter 8). Compounding in Kakua occurs very
productively as a strategy of derivation, possession, or as a strategy to form new
(lexical) meanings.
The verb morphology in Kakua is by far more complex than the morphology
of nouns, regarding both inflection and derivation (cf., Chapter 8). A detailed
discussion of inflection and word class-changing derivational processes related to a
specific part of speech can be found in later chapters where for each part a thorough
description is given.
Kakua syntax, on the other hand, is more simple and straightforward. The
preferred order is SOV, although alternative orders are often allowed (see Chapter
12).
The word in Kakua consists of roots (at least one is obligatory) plus other
optional elements such as prefixes, a large number of derivational and inflectional
suffixes, and other formatives, such as clitics. Some discourse-related morphemes,
namely particles serving as intensifiers, or adverbial particles, also cliticize to
preceding hosts. For an overview of the definition of the Kakua word see Section
§3.1 below.
The first aim of the present chapter is to offer an overview of the main types
of morphemes of Kakua. Note that this chapter provides only a basic description of
the main concepts that help define Kakua’s parts of speech and different
morphological categories. Secondly, this chapter describes Kakua’s open and closed
word classes. Open and closed word classes in Kakua differ in that open word classes
admit new items, whereas the closed classes, on the other hand, strongly resist the
introduction of new items.","[115, 116, 117]"
"10.5 Modality
10.5.0 Introduction
As argued in §10.3 above, modality refers here to a semantic category of
mood, differentiated from illocution in that modality can be used by speakers to
modify speech acts (as in Hengeveld 2004:1090), and that these modality markers
do not form clause types. The different grammaticalized markers of modality in
Kakua are presented in this section. This category consists of three distinctions:
dubitative (§10.5.1), frustrative (§10.5.2), and assertion (§10.5.3). The markers
encoding evidentiality distinctions are presented separately in the subsequent section,
§10.6. Table 10.4 summarizes the different markers encoding modality.

The dubitative modality expresses doubt as a subjective approximation of the
situation on the part of the speaker. The speaker indicates that she has a certain
degree of doubt regarding the veracity of the proposition. This semantics of the
dubitative marker in Kakua conforms to the typical characterization of what a288A Grammar of Kakuadubitative modality marker expresses (see Hengeveld 2004:1197 for one definition
of dubitative modality).
The marker for dubitative modality has two (dialectal) forms: -hin and -hip,
and is glossed ‘DUB’. One form, -hip, is used exclusively by two clans (tõjdaʔwã
‘bitter manioc’ clan and Ɂɨ ̃́ɁwẽɁwã ‘children of blowgun’ clan), while the rest of the
clans seem to use exclusively the -hin form of the dubitative in the same contexts
where -hip is used by the above mentioned clans. I present examples below of this
dubitative marker using data transcribed only for those clans that use the -hin form.
Some of these examples were elicited to ask for the possibility to use the form -hip
instead of -hin. Speakers accepted both forms, though emphasizing that the form
-hip will be the one used by individuals of a different clan (referring then to the clans
tõjdaʔwã and Ɂɨ ̃́ɁwẽɁwã).

3PL=EVID-be.deep-eat-DUB-NEG=INFERR=INTERR
‘perhaps they did not invite (her) to eat?’
It is important to note also that often the form -hin, undergoes a phonetic
reduction to -hĩ. This usually occurs when the dubitative marker is followed by a
clitic having a nasal consonant in the onset position: -hin=C+N  -hĩ=C+N. In these
cases, the vowel in the dubitative marker retains the nasal quality of the morpheme.
I note that this is the most common phonetic realization of the dubitative
marker in the context mentioned above. However, I have also noted instances in
which the dubitative marker remained -hin even in contexts when it was followed
by a nasal consonant. This is left for future reasearch. Finally, I have not tested this
for the cases of the variant of the dubitative form -hip, and a study on the different
dialectal variations in Kakua will perhaps provide an explanation regarding the status
of the -hip form of the dubitative. An example of the dubitative form, phonetically
reduced to -hĩ ‘DUB’ is given below:
65) jěb
ɲi=t-naʔa-hĩ=nit
2PL
2PL=EVID-want-DUB=INTERR
‘do you (all) want, perhaps?’10.5.2 Frustrative mood =jɨʔ
The frustrative marker =jɨɁ indicates that the event encoded by the verb did
not occur as expected, or was not fully realized as intended. It can also indicate that
the action was fully realized but without the intended outcome. I thus follow here
the definition of frustrative proposed by Overall (forthcoming: 3), as a grammatical
marker expressing “the non-realization of some expected outcome implied by theTense, aspect, mood and evidentiality289proposition expressed in the marked clause.”. The frustrative marker is presented as
an enclitic; however, as seen in Chapter 8, the frustrative can also occur as a suffix,
as in (66), or even detached from any preceding element, as in (68), as discussed
below.
66) ɲi=beh-hin-jɨʔ=na

to go on upriver’
68) nih=na
jɨɁ=na
say=DECL FRUST=DECL
‘he said (but failed to accomplished what was said)’
The marker is a suffix in (66) because it precedes the declarative marker,
which is in the first enclitic position of the verb template (see Chapter 8). In (68) it
is a morpheme detached from the preceding elements, because each element of the
clause is taking a declarative marker of its own. The declarative marker is never
marked twice in the same word. When the clause is marked for evidentiality, the
frustrative marker will follow both the declarative marker (as opposed to what is
shown in (66) and (67) above), and the evidential marker. This is illustrated in (69)
below:
69) Ɂĩ=tiɁ-nih=na=wɨt=jɨɁ=hĩ
3PL=EVID-say=DECL=REP.EVID=FRUST=REM.PST
‘(it is said) they said but weren’t heard’
As discussed in Müller (2013:106ff), and Overall (forthcoming:7), frustrative
marking does not necessarily overlap with an incompletive meaning, but instead
refers to a situation the outcome of which is contrary to expectations, where the
situation may or may not be completed. Likewise, the frustrative marker in Kakua
refers to the speaker’s expectations regarding the outcome of the proposition, and,
although the frustrative is normally used in propositions that are fully completed, it
is not contradictory with a progressive or telic aspect (§10.2.2 and §10.2.3 above
respectively). An example of Kakua telic aspect co-occurring with the frustrative
mood is given below:290A Grammar of Kakua70) wã=pĩ-tʃap̃̂ -fɨʔɨ=jɨɁ=hĩ
1SG=HAB-make.prayer-TEL.PROG=FRUST=REM.PST
‘I still prayed vainly’ (I used to pray vainly and still am praying)
Kakua has another form that expresses meanings similar to the frustrative
marker =jɨɁ, but that usually functions as a verb,11 not as a grammatical morpheme.
This is the verb najɁ ‘to want to do something but not to be able to’. It is described
here as a ‘borderline’ form between a verb and a functional morpheme, particularly
because of i) its semantics when functioning as a verb versus when used as a
functional morpheme, and ii) because of its morphosyntactic position when
functioning as a verb, different from that when it is a functional morpheme.
When functioning as a verb, it encodes ‘wanting to perform an event but not
being able to’. When used as a functional morpheme, it conveys that the ability for
performing an event is no longer present, but it is possible to achieve such ability
again. Then it is glossed as ‘WANT.TO’, and functions morphosyntactically as a clitic
(or as a suffix, as future research will have to show), as in the elicited example in
(71). In this example, najʔ conveys that there was the ability to blow, and now the
ability is not there but can be recovered. The ‘blowing’, as opposed to example (72)
below from natural speech, did not occur in vain:
71) wã=pĩ-pɨwɁ-ɨp=najɁ=hĩ
1SG=HAB-blow-PST=WANT.TO=REM.PST
‘I used to be able to blow’ (can’t blow now but can try to do it)
As mentioned above, najɁ is not incompatible with the frustrative marker, and
its function is not that of encoding frustrative. This is illustrated in the following
example. Note that the occurrence of the frustrative marker indicates that although
there used to be an ability to perform an event (blowing as part of a shamanic healing
prayer), both the blowing and the ability to perform the blowing do not have the
expected outcome: ‘blew in vain’, and ‘had the ability but that ability can no longer
be recuperated’):
72) wã=pĩ-pɨwɁ-ɨp=najɁ=jɨɁ=hĩ
1SG=HAB-blow-PST=WANT.TO=FRUST=REM.PST
‘I used to be able to blow in vain’ (used to blow in vain but now I can’t and
can’t try either).
Note also that the form ‘WANT.TO’ follows the functional suffix -Vp ‘PST’.
Given that there are no infixes in Kakua (or grammatical formatives that can
intervene between two stems), the form najʔ can have two potential analyses: i) it is
Note that having both a verb and a grammatical functional status is also found for other
morphemes in Kakua, such as the directional morpheme =buh ‘DIR’, which when functioning as a verb
means ‘to do an action from far’, and the reported evidential =wɨt ‘REP.EVID’, which is also recognized
as a verb meaning ‘to command’. See Chapter 8 for a brief discussion.
11Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality291a formative (suffix or enclitic), or it is a verb stem which should be analyzed
separately from the preceding construction as follows (where the verb najʔ lacks the
cross-referencing proclitic):
73) wã=pĩ-pɨwɁ-ɨp
najɁ=jɨɁ=hĩ
1SG=HAB-blow-PST
want.but.can’t.do=FRUST=REM.PST
Intended meaning: ‘I used to be able to blow vainly’ (used to blow vainly but
now I can’t and can’t try either).
When the possibility of stating the sentence in (73) above was checked with
native speakers two things happened. Firstly, speakers hesitantly accepted the
construction but evaluated it as strange. Secondly, speakers tried to make sense of
the construction but the meaning changed quite a bit: the frustrative marker had
scope only over the verb najʔ ‘want but can not do’, and not over the verb pɨwɁ
‘blow’. Thus, the meaning of the construction was given as: ‘I used to blow
(successfully), and I used to want but can’t do blowing, but now I don’t want and
can’t do.’
Examples (66) to (73)above show that there is a fascinating field awaiting to
be explored regarding not only the semantics of a contra-expected outcome of a
situation, but also regarding the development of grammatical morphemes in Kakua
expressing modality distinctions.","[308, 309, 310, 311, 312]"
"3.1Overview of types of morphemes3.1.0 Overview of the morphosyntactic characteristics of the types of morphemes
This section summarizes the main characteristics of the different types of
morphemes in Kakua.
Syntactically, morphemes in Kakua can be divided into two basic types of
morphemes: free morphemes and bound morphemes.
Free morphemes are monomorphemic roots, which may represent nouns,
adjectives, adverbs, or particles. Verbs, on the other hand, cannot occur as free
morphemes (exceptions to this are discussed in Chapter 8 where a full description of
Kakua’s verbal morphology is given).
Bound morphemes can be subdivided into three types: i) roots, ii) affixes, and
iii) clitics. Bound roots have lexical semantic content, whereas formatives (affixes
and clitics) tend to have a more abstract grammatical content. Some formatives,
nonetheless, have a clear lexical source from which a grammatical function has been
derived, and both the semantic meaning and the grammatical function can still be
identified.
Most of the grammatical morphology in Kakua occurs after the stem. Thus,
the set of suffixes and enclitics is larger than the set of prefixes and proclitics.
Affixes can be further subdivided into inflectional and derivational affixes.
Derivational affixes are optional whereas inflectional affixes are obligatory.
A list of the different types of morphemes in Kakua is seen in Table 3.1

morphemesAs opposed to the free morphemes and bound roots, affixes and clitics cannot
function as heads of phrases. Those morphemes that can function as head of phrases
are understood as words, whereas affixes and clitics form the set of formatives in
Kakua. The morphosyntactic characteristics of these formatives are described in
§3.1.2 below.
The semantics and morphosyntax of the different word classes in Kakua are
described in §3.2 and §3.3 of this chapter.","[118, 119]"
"3.1.1 Identifying affixes and clitics
A property common to affixes and clitics is that there are no pauses in
between these formatives and their hosts. The main syntactic characteristic that
differentiates affixes from clitics in Kakua is that clitics, unlike affixes, can attach to
different hosts. The ‘freedom of host selection’ is a defining characteristic of
prototypical clitics cross-linguistically (cf. Bickel & Nichols 2007: 174, see also
Haspelmath & Sims 2010: 197ff.). Affixes, on the other hand, have a much more
restricted syntactic distribution and are, for the most part, exclusive to a particular98A Grammar of Kakuaparts of speech. An overview of some of the clitic morphemes and their hosts is

Some morphemes, described here as clitics (such as the case of the clitic=buh ‘action from far’, which encodes the meaning of an action that is performed
from a distance far from the actor) do not satisfy the criteria of freedom of hostTypes of morphemes and word classes99selection. However, they are still being described as clitics here, because they occur
after a string of clitic positions of their host. Thus, describing them as affixes would
fail to account for the identity of the morphemes (clitics) which precede these set of
clitics which do not have freedom of host selection.
The status of case markers as clitics vs. affixes will be discussed in some
detail here, as one example how clitics can be distinguished from affixes in Kakua.
Case markers have freedom of host selection in that they attach to nouns and
adjectives (which share some, but not all characteristics of nouns, see section 3.3.5).
On the other hand, case markers may only occur on verbs if these are in the
subordinate clause (see Chapter 12 for a description of subordinate clauses in
Kakua). Case markers also display a greater freedom of movement than affixes in
two further respects. Firstly, they can occur on only one element of the noun phrase,
rather than on each individual elements of the noun phrase (examples (4)-(8), which
can be the second (4)-(6) or the first element (7).

Normally, the remote past clitic occurs at the very end of a construction. These
examples are not common. I only have gathered a few. One such is:

(long ago when the eclipse was passing) they asked the dead cadaver’ (Spanish
‘el cadaver finado’)Affixes, unlike any other type of morpheme in Kakua (this includes clitics
and all of the word classes), can have syllables without onsets (see Table 3.3 below),
or consist of just a consonant (Table 3.4). Also, only affixes can have unspecified
vowels in their underlying structure. Thus, they allow for the copying of the vowel
quality of the host to which they attach. As mentioned above, affixes do not have
freedom of host selection. A list illustrating some representative examples of suffixes
in Kakua and their hosts is given in Table 3.3 below:

While both nouns and verbs have suffixes specific to these word classes,

some representative examples of Kakua’s prefixes, their function and their forms:

violate the phonological restriction in Kakua that disallows consonant clusters. Note
that exceptions to phonological restrictions in Kakua occur for other affixes as well
(e.g. vowel copying and the onset-less syllables mentioned above). In what follows
of this section, I present a set of three enclitics that can attach to various word classes
to express emphasis or intensity of that constituent. These forms are: = jǔb, which
serves as an intensifier to nouns, with the semantic meaning of ‘truly’, or ‘really’.
Example (9) illustrates this verb root jǔb ‘be true’, from which this intensifier
derives, occurring within a verbal construction. Example (10) shows the function of
=jǔb as an intensifier of a pronoun:
9) panʔni=tiʔ

‘once the fire was on, (I) burned him really’kàwburnThis intensifier has freedom of host selection, and it can as well occur with
another adverb, intensifying the meaning of the adverb to which it attaches. This is
illustrated in (11) below:

are full of the intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ. Its meaning is that of an affirmation
such as ‘truly’ or ‘exactly’. This intensifier =ti can also occur with both, nouns and
verbs:̌ ʔ=hĩ=tiʔ

The intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ occurs commonly in interrogative clauses,
with interrogative pronouns and question words, and in adverbial particles such as
paniʔ=tiʔ ‘and so=INTS’, tɨt=tiʔ =ma ‘then’, and with the adverbial particle

Nouns and verbs conform the two open classes of words in Kakua.
The elements of the open word classes in Kakua have, in principle, an
unlimited membership. That is to say, the open classes of words in Kakua may
include not only native words, but also readily accept borrowings, calques, and any
other type of new lexical items such as words newly formed by semantic extensions
or by the lexicalization of formerly more complex words (e.g., historical compounds
that have undergone morphological and/or phonological fusion to form one complex
lexical item).
The main element of the members of open classes is a noun or verb root that
heads the noun or verb phrase accordingly.
Roots can be further divided into those that can occur as free elements and
those that are obligatorily bound with inflectional or derivational morphology
(Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the different free and obligatorily bound noun roots. Verb
are described in Chapters 8 and 9).
In this study a free morpheme is understood as an element that is
phonologically independent, i.e. it is not obligatorily bound to another free
morpheme or to other bound morphology in order to form a full word.
A major distinction between Kakua noun and verb roots concerns the
morphology each of these requires. Kakua nouns are formed by a free root that can
occur without the need of additional morphology. Verbs, on the other hand, require
for the most part a more complex morphology.
The main semantic, phonological, syntactic and morphological characteristics
of Kakua nouns and verbs are described in the following subsections. Subsection
§3.2.1 describes these main characteristics that define Kakua nouns. §3.2.2 deals
with the main properties that characterize verbs.","[119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"236A Grammar of KakuaPhonologically, the characteristics of verb roots are not unique to the class of
verbs (see the description of the defining characteristics of the different parts of
speech in Chapter 3). Verb roots, as roots in the language as a whole, must be
minimally monosyllabic, and maximally bisyllabic. Roots bear lexical tone, and all
of Kakua’s tonal inventory is exhibited in verb roots (as shown in 1 below):
1) jùjjûj
jǔj‘have diarrea’
‘massage while praying’
‘be dripping’Although a verb word may be composed of several roots (see Chapter 9 for verb
compounding and serialization), and these roots may present different tonal values,
the verb word as a whole has a characteristic intonation, with a high pitch at the
beginning of the word that gradually falls towards the end of the word. Thus, if a
verb word is composed of more than one root, the highest tone pitch for the second
root is invariably lower than the highest tone pitch of the first root (this is discussed
in detail in Chapter 2 on Kakua phonology regarding downdrift).
Verb roots are also lexically specified for nasality or orality, as another general
characteristic of Kakua roots that is not unique to verb roots. As briefly introduced
in Chapter 2, verbs are distinguished from nouns primarily on semantic and
morphosyntactic grounds, rather than phonological (see the overview in Chapter 2
on the parts of speech and their basic characteristics).
Semantically, verbs roots refer to actions (e.g., ʧaǩ̃ ‘bite’), processes (e.g.,
mǒp ‘to rot’), and temporal or permanent states (e.g., paʔ ‘be.like’; hěp ‘be.jealous’).
In other words, Kakua verbs prototypically express relations that are anchored in
time, processes or actions, or more general atemporal states of being such as dɨ ̀ ‘be
red’, nɨmʔ ‘be below’, etc. States denoting inherent or temporal properties are usually
expressed by descriptive verbs. The verb word may function as the predicate of the
clause.
Related to its characteristic of being a heavily agglutinative language, Kakua
verb roots tend to encode only one relatively simple meaning each, while complex
meanings are created by combining various verb roots (see discussion in §8.3 below
for each of these verbal morphemes).
Syntactically, the predicate tends to be the last constituent of the clause
(SOV). It is, thus, easy to recognize the verb word within a clause: it is the
morphologically most complex word, and the one that normally occurs in the last
syntactic position of the clause. The verb word by itself can also be sufficient both
as the predicate and as the only constituent of the clause, as is further discussed in
Chapter 11 on clause structure. Two examples are given in (2) and (3) below.
Example (2) illustrates the predicate occurring in its most typical final position.
Example (3) illustrates the predicate as sufficient to function as a clause in itself:The verb: morphology and structure

section will first address the semantics of verbs with regard to transitivity; after these
transitivity distinctions have been addressed, this section will describe the different
types of verbs with regard to other semantic features, specifically the semantic
subclasses of verbs, such as descriptive, stative, positional, and motion verbs. Other
verbal constructions and their semantics, such as verb serialization and
compounding, are dealt with in Chapter 9.
With regard to transitivity, verb roots can be identified as being inherently
intransitive or transitive (mono- or ditransitive) verbs, judging by the number of
arguments that they can take. This distinction, however, is not very straightforward
and the lexical transitivity of verb roots is often difficult to establish. This is because
arguments do not have to be overtly expressed whenever these arguments have been
previously mentioned in the discourse. This applies particularly to the overt
expression of object arguments. Subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb,
and only with restricted exceptions these are not overtly expressed. The rules
governing the optionality of cross-referencing subject proclitics are discussed in
Chapter 6.
Example (4) below illustrates this problematic classification of verbs roots
according to their lexical valency. The example is extracted from a conversation in
Kakua, shows a semantically transitive verb bɨ ́dʔ-tû ‘add.onto-hold.vertically’, where
the object argument is not expressed. However, since the argument to which the verb
is referring had been previously stated, the sentence is perfectly grammatical in
Kakua discourse:
4) bɨ ́dʔ-tû=ka=nit
add.onto-hold.vertically=ASS=S.Sʔã=t-hɨjbi-ɲɨʔ-ɨp=wɨt=hĩ3SG.M=EVID-arrive.here-stop-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
‘he arrived and stopped, and held (the panflute) vertically (against his body)’238A Grammar of KakuaThe use of another semantically transitive verb with and without an overt
object noun phrase is illustrated in (5)-(6).

‘Te went to bathe (it is said)’
3SG.F=OBJ 3PL=EVID-bathe-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
‘they bathed her (it is said)’Example (7) illustrates the semantically ditransitive verb hɨ ̂t ‘show’. With this
verb also, not all arguments need to be overtly expressed. Here, only two overt
arguments occur: the proclitic for 3SG.M ʔã= referring to the subject argument of
the clause, and the object kǎn=diʔ referring to the indirect object (recipient)
‘shaman’. The direct object (theme), tɨb ‘pain’, is dropped since it had been
previously established in the discourse:
7)kǎn=diʔhɨ ̂dɁɨ=kaʔã=t-beh=tagǎ3SG.M=OBJ
show=ASS
3SG.M= EVID-go=INF.EVID
‘perhaps he went to show (his pain) to him (the shaman)’As discussed in Chapter 8, Kakua does not mark subject arguments with
morphological case, but rather they are indexed on the verb. Other arguments
(objects), receive the case marker =diʔ ‘OBJ’. The marking of case for object
arguments, however, is governed by differential object marking rules (c.f., §8.3), and
thus, some arguments that function as objects may lack case markers. Therefore, the
presence or absence of object case markers on arguments is not a reliable indicator
of the transitivity of the root. Example (8) illustrates the verb ‘eat’ hěmʔ, where the
object argument is not morphologically marked for case, which is one of the formal
cues that help identify the valency of verb roots, here camouflaged by the absence
of such marker on the object argument:
8)Katerinetʃɨ ̂Katherine pineapple
‘Katherine eats pineapple’mi=hěmʔ=na=ka3SG.F=eat=DECL=ASSAs seen in the examples above, defining transitivity values of Kakua verbs is
complicated by the omission of arguments, on the one hand, and optionality of case
marking, on the other hand. Intransitive verbs can thus be identified as those that can
maximally take one (subject) argument, and no object arguments, while mono- and
ditransitive verbs can be identified as those that can take one or two object
arguments, keeping in mind that these do not need to be overtly expressed, and if
they are, they do not need to be marked for object case. Given the possible omissionThe verb: morphology and structure239of object arguments, mono- and ditransitive verbs can also be called ambitransitives,
i.e. verbs that may behave both like intransitive and transitive verbs.","[257, 258, 259, 260, 261]"
"The coordination of clauses in Kakua is most commonly expressed by the
simple juxtaposition of the coordinated clauses. Additionally, for some types of
coordination, such as disjunction (§13.1.2) or adversative coordination (§13.1.3),
there are morphemes that serve as coordinators between the related elements.
Subordination of clauses in Kakua uses five main mechanisms: morphological
marking with the subordinator -ni ~ -nit ‘SUBR’ (to form relative clauses §13.6), the
repetition of the verb root of the predicate of the main clause (§13.4 and §13.7), the
use of adverbial particles (§13.7), and the nominalization of the predicate in the
subordinated clause (§13.7). Additionally, to form complement clauses the
juxtaposition or the embedding of the complement clause within the main clause is
sufficient. These mechanisms are used to express the three main types of subordinate
clauses: complement, relative, and adverbial clauses (see Table 13.1 above).
Switch reference markers serve to link clauses in a way that the maintenance
or switch of the subject of the following clause is indicated (§13.3 of this chapter).
Tail-head linkage is another strategy used in Kakua to link clauses (§13.4). As with
the switch reference markers, tail-head linkage is not only used for linking a
subordinate clause to a main clause, but also as a strategy of clause combining in
general, with a focus on the temporal succession of the linked elements.",[389]
"Types of morphemes and word classes1253.3.7 Particles
Particles form a small but very heterogeneous classes of words. Particles are
a group of words that –like most adverbs, adjectives and nouns- can occur as
utterances on their own. Unlike adverbs and adjectives, these words do not function
as modifiers.
Particles do not take any type of derivational or inflectional morphology.
They do not compound together with other elements. Particles are monomorphemic
words.
Particles can be used as minimal expressions, responses, or reactions in a
discourse. This heterogeneous class of words includes discourse elements like the
hesitation particle nép ‘who was it now?’, or discourse tags like bat ‘dude’, hɨʔ̌ ‘and
what do you knowǃ’, expressions of astonishment like hiw
̌ ‘no wayǃ’; and
interjections like ʔagá ‘ouch!’. A list of these particles is given in Table 3.12 below:

"Complex Clauses36313.7 Adverbial clauses
Clauses which modify the verb of the higher clause or the higher clause in its

"Alignment and word order309Compare this to the construction in (14), where the clause is formed by a single
predicate with the proclitic wã= ‘1SG’, indexing the subject argument of this
intransitive clause:
13) kǎn
ʔã=ʔêw=na=ka
3SG.M
3SG.M=sing=DECL=ASS
‘he is singing’
14) wã=pĩ-ʔɨm=na=ka
1SG=HAB-be.afraid=DECL=ASS
‘I’m always afraid’
Subject arguments can express the semantic roles of agents or experiencers.
Examples (15) and (16) show subject arguments of stative verbs in which the subject
arguments have the semantic role of ‘patient’, a prototypical semantic role of subjects
of stative verbs:
15) wěm
wã=pĩ-hêjʔ-weʔe-kan=be
1SG
1SG=HABT-know-NEG=REC.PST
‘I used to know’
16) wěm
bɨ
wã=tʃù-fwɨʔɨ
1sg
today
1SG=rest-TEL.PROG
‘I am, today, still resting’
Subjects of intransitive verbs of motion or active verbs prototypically have
the semantic role of agent. This is illustrated in example (17) below:
17) kǎn
ʔã=t-fwɨ ̂b-ʔǎb-beh=na
3SG.M
3SG.M=EVID-follow-go.up-go=DECL
‘he went back up again’
Finally, subjects of intransitive clauses involving verbs of mental or emotional
processes (or verbs of perception) prototypically have the semantic role of
experiencers. Examples (18)-(20) below give an illustration of these types of clauses
in Kakua:
18) kǎnʔ
mi=pĩ-tîk=na=ka

Examples (12)-(20) above illustrate the expression of subject arguments in
intransitive clauses, showing that, although the subject noun phrase does not receive
morphological marking to indicate its grammatical function (i.e. no subject case
marker), the verb usually takes a cross-referencing proclitic encoding person and
number properties of the subject argument.
The expression of subject arguments in transitive clauses is illustrated in
examples (21)-(22), which show that the subject arguments are morphologically and
syntactically expressed in the same way as the subject arguments in the intransitive
clauses presented in (11)-(20) above. In (21) the subject argument expressed by the
NP wã=ʔibi ‘my uncle’ is the instigator of the action expressed by the transitive
verb tɨh ‘kill with blowgun’ performed on an object argument with the semantic role
of patient, which is morphologically marked with the object case marker =diʔ:
21) wã=ʔibi
wɨbɨ=diʔ
1SG=uncle bird.sp=OBJʔã=t-tɨh=na=tagǎ3SG.M=EVID-kill.with.blowgun=DECL=INF.EVIDtʃãhãpPROG‘my uncle must be hunting Curassow (bird.sp)’
Example (22) shows a similar type of clause, where the subject argument is
expressed both by the NP hiw ‘jaguar’, and indexed on the predicate with the
proclitic ‘3SG.M’, agreeing in person, number and gender with the subject argument:
22) hiw
mɨhiw=diʔ
ʔã=t-tʃãk=na=wɨt=be
jaguar dog=OBJ
3SG.M=EVID-bite=DECL=REP.EVID=REC.PST
‘the jaguar bit the dog, it is said’
The syntactic position of subject arguments in intransitive and transitive
clauses is preferably sentence-initial (see above). Additional examples are given in
(23)-(24), displaying constructions involving verbs of perception or mental
processes. In (23) the subject is a lexical noun cross-referenced on the verb by the
proclitic ʔã= ‘3SG.M’. In (24) the subject argument is a pronoun and is also crossreferenced on the verb:

through an NP, but indexed on the predicate of the clause only. In this case the
resulting constituent order is O s=V. Example (26) further illustrates the same order,
where the noun wãp ‘white capuchin’ is the object of the verb fwãʔ ‘find’, and the
subject is expressed by the proclitic fwĩ= ‘1PL’:

Kakua marks its object arguments with the case marker enclitic =diʔ on the
object NP, i.e. a dependent-marking strategy, in terms of Nichols (1986). Unlike
subject arguments, object arguments are not indexed on the verb. Examples (27)(28) below illustrate object case marking:
27) měm=be
2SG=REC.PST
‘you taught me’wěm=diʔ1SG= OBJ28) wěm

different semantic roles.1 This is examplified in (29)-(32). (See further discussion on
semantic roles and object marking in Chapter 6). Example (29) shows an object
1See the comment in Chapter 6 regarding the possibility that the object marker =diɁ might haveother functions than marking object arguments, as it also occurs on noun phrases expressing source/goal,
as well as on other NPs that are not core arguments.","[329, 330, 331, 332]"
"128A Grammar of KakuaBound noun stems are almost all obligatorily possessed. These include, but
are not restricted to, nouns with human referents, like kinship terms, but also nouns
denoting body parts, parts of a bigger entity, hunting and personal instruments. Also
included in this group of obligatorily bound noun stems are a large number of nouns
referring to inanimate entities which must be specified by a shape classifier suffix.
The nature of these nouns is further described in Chapter 5 (on compounding,
classification, and possession of nouns in Kakua), which also includes a discussion
on the status of classifiers. Bound nouns thus require a possessive pro-form
preceding the obligatorily bound noun (see Chapter 5 for a description of possession
in Kakua, obligatoriness and the alienable/inalienable distinctions).
Kinship terms in Kakua, for example, are obligatorily possessed.
Furthermore, they are possessed via a strategy of inalienable possession in which
they take a proclitic pronoun, and not possessive pronouns (see Section §7.1 in
Chapter 7 for a description of pronominal forms in Kakua):
1)a. wã=ipb.Ɂĩ=hî

‘their son in law’mi=nɨm
3SG.F=daughter
‘her daughter’2)a. *ipb.*hî*nɨm1SG=father
‘my father’fatherson.in.lawc.daughterNouns that can occur as free forms without need of additional morphology
include proper names, nouns referring to animals, vocative forms of kinship terms,
elements referring to parts of the natural environment (e.g., dirt, star, sun, dawn),
and some objects that do not need to be specified by shape classifiers.
3)a. bɨ ̌bʔ4.2Noun template‘louse’b.ʔîm‘lake’c.Ɂetá‘grandmother.VOC’Nominal morphology in Kakua is by far less complex than verbal
morphology. Kakua nouns never take prefixes. With the exception of proclitics
(including possessive proclitics which obligatorily precede bound nouns), the
morphology of nouns in Kakua is exclusively post-stem, and this includes suffixes
and enclitics.
Free noun roots can stand on their own as the only obligatory element to form
a noun word in Kakua, unlike verbs (see §3.1.1 and Chapter 8 for verb morphology).
Free nouns roots can also function as arguments of a predicate or as an attributive
modifier of another noun.
Of all of Kakua’s word classes, only nouns can be specified for possession.
Nominal negation is expressed through existential negation constructions (see
Chapter 12, §12.7 for a description on existential negation constructions).","[149, 150]"
"10.5.3 Assertion mood =ka ~ =kɨ
The clitic =ka expresses assertion by the speaker. By using this clitic, the
speaker expresses her attitude towards the situation, in a sense that it is the speaker
herself who takes responsibility for stating the situation.
This enclitic of assertion has two forms =ka and =kɨ. Kakua speakers of
Nuevo Pueblo use the form =kɨ exclusively. Kakua speakers of Wacará, on the other
hand, use both =ka and =kɨ. The form=ka is used as the general assertion marker.
The form =kɨ appears to have a deictic meaning as well, indicating a spatial distance
between the speaker and the hearer. Thus, the difference between the example from
a text in (74) and the elicited example in (75) is that in (74) the speaker is in close
spatial proximity to the hearer, while in (75) the speaker is presumably speaking
from a distant point. The deictic distinction is not commonly marked, and because
of this I describe the form =ka as the ‘default’ form of the assertion marker.

The marker of assertion, as seen in example (76) above, can occur in
situations anchored in a future tense. In these cases, the assertion marker is
acceptable if the future situation is likely to take place, given that the assertion
marker encodes a situation to which the speaker is committed.
The assertion marker can also co-occur in situations that are further specified
for evidentiality, specifically with the reported evidential marker (§10.6.6). InTense, aspect, mood and evidentiality293principle, the assertion marker does not occur with the past and present forms of the
inferred evidentiality marker (see §10.6.5 below), this might have to do with the fact
that inferring that a situation has occurred (inferred evidentiality), doesn’t represent
the confidence needed for the speaker to commit an assertion towards the situation.
An alternative analysis for the assertion marker possibly having fused with the
inferred evidential marker is presented §10.6.5 below (although an inference in the
future tense can be marked with the assertion marker).","[312, 313, 314]"
"13.1.3 Adversative coordination
Adversative expressions encoding an emphatic meaning of opposition are
marked with the particle ʔubuʔhéʔti ‘but/although/on the other hand’. Its polysyllabic
form suggests that it is historically complex, but the etymology of this word remains
unclear.3 Some examples of the use of this adversative particle are given below:3Hypothetically this form may be analyzed as follows: ʔu-buʔ=héʔ=ti ‘?-?=INTS=INTS’.

In addition to the adversative particle ʔubuʔheʔtiʔ, Kakua also uses
juxtaposition to express adversative relations. Although this is more limited, and the
adversative coordinator connector ʔubuʔheʔtiʔ is preferred, a few instances of
juxtaposition with an emphatic adversative meaning are found within the corpus.
Example (13) below illustrates this adversative reading of the juxtaposed
construction. Note that in this construction the emphatic clitic =bǔ is used to encode
a contrast between the emphasized elements (see Chapter 3 for a discussion of the
emphatic semantics of =bǔ):

It is noteworthy that there is a strong awareness among Kakua speakers about
using the ‘correct’ evidential marking for each situation. The following episode that
occurred during my fieldwork illustrates how important evidential marking is in
Kakua speech. The following example comes from a conversation after watching a
documentary movie about the Nɨkak. Here the speaker is telling what he saw the
night before in the movie. Since this was a movie, choosing the correct evidential
marker is non-trivial, especially because the speaker himself had seen the Nɨkak
people before when they were brought to the Kakua village in the late 1980s. Thus,
he appears to have regarded the images in the movie as projections of situations in
the real world. However, a movie, or a photographic image, is not regarded as a
direct visual experience, but as information experienced through some other sensorial
means. The speaker hesitated on what evidential marker he should use, and, as seen
in the example below, he repeats the same predicate ( ʔĩ-t=jǎk-bâbʔ-bâbʔ=hĩ
3PL=EVID-cook-drink-drink=REM.PST ‘they cooked and drank’) various times until
he finally decides that expressing the proposition as visually experienced, without
any formal marking, is the most accurate way to tell his version of the story. The
text continued with the speaker only using the visual (unmarked) form.","[323, 324]"
"Elements of the noun phrase223The motivation for proposing a source relating to a meaning of ‘be.together’
plus an additional morphological element, relies on two facts: i) many Eastern
Tukanoan languages have a clear etymological source for the numeral ‘four’ with a
meaning similar to ‘having a companion’ (see Huber & Reed 1992 for Eastern
Tukanoan languages Tatuyo, Barasano, Tuyuka, Yurutí, Makuna, Piratapuyo,
Siriano, Karapano). Thus, extrapolating this logic to the Kakua term for ‘three’, it
could be translated into ‘that who does not have a companion’. ii) This directs the
hypothesis of thinking that possibly the form was constructed from a, previously,
complex compound involving the negative existential morpheme wîʔi-kan ‘not.existNEG’, or the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ which was attached to the verb péh meaning
‘be.together’, or ‘be friends’. Example (37) below was found in a Kakua text, in this
case, not referring to the numeral three in itself, but to an odd numbered item. Here
the speaker was counting pairs of seeds, when one seed was standing by itself in the
line of paired seeds:
37) bǐʔ
othertibseedʔã=t-péh-wíʔi-kap=wɨt=hĩ3SG.M=EVID-be.together-NOT.EXIST-NEG=REP.EVID=REM.PST
‘one seed was odd (didn’t have a partner)’
Forms for numerals 6-20 are based on terms for hands, feet, fingers and toes,
added to the terms for numerals one, two, and three. These are shown in Table 7.6
below.
Note that in the glosses given for these lexemes, sometimes the plural
morpheme given is the animate plural -wã (e.g., ʧênewã ‘two’) or the inanimate
plural -na (e.g., ʧênna ‘two’, ʧênenamîk ‘four’). The use of either plural animate or
plural inanimate is determined by the animacy of the enumerated noun: if it is
inanimate (ʧênna mɨ ̃̌ ‘two houses’) the plural form used in the numerals is the
inanimate plural -na ‘IN.PL’. If it is animate (ʧênwã kãk ‘two persons’) the plural
form used in the numeral is the animate plural suffix -wã.

‘with two hands and two feet like this’As seen in the forms given in Tables 7.5 and 7.6 above, Kakua does not have
any special morphology for higher numerals. Instead, compounds of verb or noun
roots, and other additional morphology not specific to numerals or quantifiers are
used form these.
Although Kakua speakers have reported that this numeral system can be
extended to numbers higher than 20, by adding terms of body parts of other
individuals (‘two hands and two feet and one hand from another person’), in actual
practice any quantity beyond five is expressed by using Spanish loans, as in (38) and
(39):

between the numerals one and two. Even though one would expect the use of one
finger for one, and the gesture in picture 1 for number two only, the gesture in Picture

"The verb: morphology and structure251Position 10: Suffixes: aspect and modality
The last suffix positions is filled by the telic progressive aspect suffix -fɨʔɨ,
indicating that an event is still ongoing but has a terminal point, as shown in (38)(40), or the frustrative suffix -jɨʔ as in (41) below (recall that the frustrative marker
can occur as a suffix, but also as an enclitic when the clause contains the reported
evidential. See also examples (45)-(46) below. The telic progressive aspect is further
discussed in Chapter 10):

Position 11: Enclitics: sentential Mood
Position 11 is filled by enclitics marking sentential (illocutionary) mood.
Example (42) shows the interrogative mood marker filling position 11. The
declarative mood marker also occurs in this position (see examples (38)-(41)) and is
in complementary distribution with the interrogative marker. A more extensive
description of these markers is given in Chapter 10 and 12.

marked by =wɨt, inferred evidentiality marked by =tâ, and inferred future
evidentiality marked by =dê (see more in Chapter 15). Examples (43) and (44)
illustrate two of the three evidentiality markers that are mutually exclusive in position

This position can only be filled by the frustrative enclitic =jɨʔ and only if
the clause contains the reported evidentiality marker =wɨt in slot 12). See example
(45) below and note that the frustrative enclitic occurs after the reported evidential
marker. This order was tested with speakers, who were prompted with the structure
in (46), where the frustrative enclitic precedes the reported evidential marker, and
judged this as unacceptable.

Intended meaning: ‘They wanted to stay and couldn’t’
Position 14: Enclitics: Tense and mood
This position is filled by three enclitics that cannot co-occur with each other.
These enclitics indicate recent past =be ‘REC.PST’, remote past =hĩ ‘REM.PST’, and
assertion mood=ka.
There are two forms of the assertion marker. The form=ka of the assertion
marker is used as the default. When the event being referred to is marked with the
assertion mood and takes place close to the speaker, the default form =ka is used.
When the event needs to be specified as taking place at some distance from the
speaker, the form =kɨ is used instead. This deictic distinction is made only by Kakua
speakers from Nuevo Pueblo belonging to clans descending from clans in Wacará.
The form =ka is not used by Kakua speakers of Nuevo Pueblo, and instead only the
form =kɨ is used with no deictic value.
Example (47) illustrates a statement uttered while the speaker is distant from
the event being referred to (the event being that a person is approaching). The clitic
is glossed here as ‘ASS.DIST’ assertion distant). In (48), instead, the speaker refers to
the same event, but this time it is taking place close to the place where the speaker
is uttering the statement. The clitic is glossed here as ‘ASS.PROX’, assertion

Additional illustrations of this deictic encoding of the forms =ka and =kɨ
of the assertion marker are given in (49)-(50). The form in (49) is used as a farewell
greeting when the speaker is close to the addressee. The form in (50) is used when
the speaker is waving goodbye from a distance to the addressee:
49) beh=na=ka
go=DECL=ASS
‘I leave’

Position 15: Enclitics: directional, intensifier, and switch reference markers
The last slot of the verb word may be filled by enclitics encoding several
different meanings. These enclitics express additional information to the verb word:
the intensifier enclitic =bɨká (51); the enclitic =buh which provides modal
information about the clause, glossed here as an action done from far away, as in
example (52); and the different-subject enclitic, as illustrated in example in (53). The
enclitics occurring in this slot cannot co-occur.

variety of heterogeneous semantic distinctions. Many TAME specifications are
encoded by verbal affixes, while others are encoded in clitics that have freedom of
host selection, but also often occur on the predicate of the clause in Kakua (see Table
3.2 showing enclitics and their different hosts presented in Chapter 3).
It is important to note that there are a few apparent counterexamples to the
morpheme ordering given in the template above. These concern the ordering of the
reportative evidential clitic =wɨt ‘REP’ and the directional clitic =buh. Both of these
markers have a clear lexical origin, as can be seen in the following examples:
54) nǎwʔ-beh=na

‘(the jaguar) he fell on the floor’ (and died finally).bɨkáEMPHExample (54) shows the use of wɨt as a lexical verb with the meaning
‘command’, while (55) illustrates the use of buh as a verb meaning ‘do from far’. In
(54) wɨt must be a lexical verb as it occurs with a temporal suffix, while in (55) buh
must be a lexical verb as it is part of a serializing construction. In some cases the
two clitics seem to preserve part of their lexical behavior. This is shown in the
following example:3
56) tʃúh-at=tɨt,

‘(they) after bathed her, they cut her hair’In this example the two elements buhu and wɨt are followed by the remote
past clitic =hĩ, which shows that they are not in their regular position: wɨt (position
12) should not be preceded by buhu (position 15), and buhu (position 15) should not
be followed by =hĩ (position 14). Examples like these have a straightforward
3Note that a vowel is inserted in the form buh as a phonetic strategy to avoid consonant clusters,as described in Chapter 2.","[272, 273, 274, 275, 276]"
"10.6.2 Nonvisual evidentiality
Nonvisual evidentiality in Kakua is a category which indicates that the
situation was experienced by the speaker on a firsthand basis through sensorial means
other than visual. Nonvisual sensorial means include those of smelling, hearing,
tasting, or feeling through the skin. As opposed to the reported category, which refers
to a situation in which a speech report concerning the event was heard, ‘hearing’ in
the nonvisual category implies that the speaker directly heard the situation taking
place. To indicate nonvisual evidentiality, the prefix ĩ- is used (as shown in (87)
above), and it is glossed here as ‘NON.VIS’. This form does not occur very often in
my data.13 It was given to me especially in elicitation sessions, but in texts of
conversations, narratives, etc., its occurrence is very limited. Some examples are
presented below in (88) and (89) from natural text, and in (90) from elicitation:

90) ʔã=ĩ-hɨw
3SG.M=NON.VIS-come=DECL=ASS
‘he is coming’ (His noise gives him away, the speaker can hear him coming)
Perhaps an evaluation of the different speech genres or speech situations, such as conversations,
narratives, etc, and their interaction with different tenses, can give a clearer picture regarding the use of
this evidential marker.
13Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality297One’s own personal states, such as feelings, or thoughts, however, are not
marked with this nonvisual evidential prefix. Instead, the unmarked form (visual) is
used. This seems to be the opposite of the common prediction of the nonvisual
category in some of the Vaupés languages (see for example Ramirez 1997 for
Tukano, Epps 2008 for Hup).
As the examples above show, the use of this nonvisual evidential is not
restricted to the first person, as it can refer to situations being performed by a third
person (as in (87) and (90) above). In these examples the event is being undertaken
by a third person, but the evidential indicates that the speaker is basing her
knowledge of the situation on her own sensorial experience of the situation taking
place, that is, the speaker hears the event taking place and presents it as such, though
the event is not being carried out by the speaker herself.
In some languages with evidentiality systems, the nonvisual evidential is
derived from verbs of perception such as ‘hear’, or ‘see’ (c.f., Aikhenvald
2004:174f). The nonvisual evidential marker in Kakua does not have a clear
etymological source, either within Kakua or in Nɨkak. In Nɨkak no such category has
been reported, nor are there verbs in Kakua meaning ‘see’ or ‘hear’ that could be
related to Kakua ĩ-, in the data that I have gathered for Kakua.
Finally, it is also important to note that a nonvisual category encoding
information which was directly experienced by the speaker (by sensorial means
different from visual), has been described for many languages of the Vaupés area
(c.f., Barnes 1990 for Tuyuca, Ramirez 1997 for Tukano, Aikhenvald 2003, 2004 for
Tariana; Epps 2008 for Hup among others). This brings up the possibility that the
nonvisual evidential prefix in Kakua might reflect an areal feature. If there is a
correlation of the nonvisual evidential in Kakua with those of its neighboring
languages, I propose that it is likely that the prefix was already in the language before
Kakua came in contact with Tukanoan languages. Perhaps the prefix had a different
meaning, but in any case I am more inclined to think that the form itself is unlikely
to be to a borrowing. I propose this for two reasons:
i)on the one hand, the few (identifiable) morphological borrowings in
Kakua (with the exception of the terminative preposition pɨ ‘TERM’, see
Chapter 12), correspond to forms that occur after the stem, primarily
because most of the languages spoken in the Vaupés area do not have
prefixing positions;14 thus, if the nonvisual prefix in Kakua were to
correspond to a borrowing from a neighboring language, it would be
somehow strange to adopt it as a prefix in Kakua, instead of as a poststem form if it came from a suffix. If it came from a prefix, it would
be easily identifiable from the source language.
Kakua has a limited number of prefixes, and at least one of them (the
habitual marker) can be said to be a form inherited from proto Kakua-ii)Gómez-Imbert, in personal communication, mentioned that Barasana (ET), for example has
some prefixing positions. It is not, however, a widespread pattern of languages spoken in the Vaupés,
which are mainly suffixing languages.
14298A Grammar of Kakua
Nɨkakan. It will be difficult to strongly support an argument in which,
instead of considering prefixing forms as a shared feature in the protolanguage, these prefixing forms in Kakua were to be considered an
innovation entering Kakua through contact with neighboring Vaupés
languages, when what has been noted mostly is that Kakua has
borrowed quite a few suffixing or post-stem forms.","[317, 318, 319]"
"3.2.2 Verbs
Verbs form the second open word class in Kakua. In general, the verb part of
speech is formed by lexical items that function as heads of verb phrases.
Semantically, in accordance with the typologically expected semantics of verbs (see
Schachter & Shopen 2007: 9-13), Kakua verbs express actions (e.g., ʧǎk ‘bite’),
processes (e.g., mǒp ‘to rot’), and temporal or permanent states (e.g., paʔ ‘be.like’;
hěp ‘be.jealous’). In other words, Kakua verbs prototypically express relations that
are anchored in time, processes or actions, or more general atemporal states of being
such as dɨ ̀ ‘be red’, nɨmʔ ‘be below’, etc. States denoting inherent or temporal
properties are usually expressed by descriptive verbs (see Chapter 8 for a detailed
description of verbs).
The semantic concepts expressed by verbs differ considerably from those
expressed by nouns. Based on semantics itself, verbs and nouns can be identified as
two different parts of speech. Morphological and syntactic properties of verbs are
addressed below in this section.
Unlike nouns, verb roots in general cannot appear as free forms, i.e. cannot
be uninflected. With the exception of some specific contexts in which verb roots can
appear as free forms, verbs always require minimally a mood suffix (the exceptional
contexts in which verb roots can appear as free forms are discussed in detail in
Chapters 8 and 9).
All of the tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality distictions are encoded in
verbal morphology, but note that some of the enclitcs encoding tense, aspect, mood
and evidentiality can also occur on other parts of speech.
A verb root must always be specified by mood (enclitic), and when the
specific semantic and discourse related criteria are meet, the proclitics must always
precede the verb root. Verb roots occurring as free elements have a very restricted
range of contexts, one of them being citation forms (example 26, further below). In
general, verbs in Kakua consist of at least one root plus an obligatory mood (e.g.,
declarative) clitic. A detailed description of verb morphology and structure is given
in Chapter 8.
In addition to the obligatory morphology, verbs generally take proclitics that
agree with the subject argument of the clause. For this reason, an intransitive verb
marked with a person and number proclitic and a mood enclitic can serve as a
complete sentence on its own:108A Grammar of Kakua32) wã=beh=na
1SG=go=DECL
‘I am leaving’
A simplified verbal template is given in figure 3.2 below. Obligatory elements
are in bold.
Figure 3.2 Simplified verb template
{PN=prefixes-reflexive/reciprocal prefix-root(s)-suffixes=clitics}
Example (33) below illustrates the syntactic positions of morphemes in the
verb template (highlighted in bold is the morphology other than verb roots):

‘(it is said) She pulled him up, got him out (and) let him lying there (on the
floor)’
Syntactically, verbs can head verb phrases that can function as predicates.
Verb phrases in Kakua are preferably clause final. Examples (34) and (35) below
illustrate verbs in their most common clause-final syntactic position:

1PL=HAB-tighten-step-set.on.standing.up=EMPH
‘we will always only leave it clogged’ (the sewing machines)
Additionally, verb roots can succeed each other as a string of verb roots
creating a complex description of one single main event. This concatenation of verb
roots, or verb serialization, seems to be fairly widespread among the VaupésTypes of morphemes and word classes109languages as a strategy for encoding a set of actions occurring as one single event
(c.f. Aikhenvald 2002b, Aikhenvald 2006, Epps 2008, Aikhenvald 2012).
Example (38) below illustrates an instance of a sequence of verbs interpreted
in Kakua as all describing a single event (refer to Chapter 9 for description of verb
compounding and verb serialization in Kakua).
38) wã=jabʔ-ʔǎb-beh-hɨ ̂d-fwɨ ̂b-beh=nit=puʔba
1SG=to.pass-go.up-go-go.around.in.circles-turn-go=SS=EMPH
‘I passed, went up and around and came back there, for realǃ’
In section 3.2.1 above on the description of nouns, examples were shown to
illustrate the derivation of nouns from verb stems (nominalization of verbs, see
example (28) above). This derivation of nouns allows for verb roots to occur in other
non-verbal constructions. An additional example of nominalization of verb stems is
given in (39) below:
39) mi=iʔ-wɨn-at
3SG.F=POSS=die-NMLZ
‘her death’
Case marking morphology is exclusive to nouns and can only attach to verb
stems once these have been nominalized:

a)Semantically, verbs denote relations anchored to temporal and atemporal
processes, actions, or temporal or permanent states.
b) Syntactically, verbs can function as head of verb phrases that can themselves
function as predicates.","[129, 130, 131]"
"10.3 Mood: illocution and modality
The modal categories in Kakua are very versatile and encode many more
distinctions than any other category related to the event or situation encoded by the
predicate.
While tense and aspect deal with temporal particularities of a proposition
(‘external temporal constituency’ and ‘internal temporal constituency’, respectively,
as in Comrie 1976:3), mood deals with finer specifications regarding the status of
the proposition, reflecting a speaker’s attitude towards the proposition, “not directly
concerned with situating an event in the actual world, as conceived by the speaker”
(Hengeveld 2004:1190). Consequently, mood in Kakua is described here as the
morphological category that is not anchored to an expression of time, but rather it is
concerned with expressing “the status of the proposition” describing the event (I
follow here Palmer’s 2001 general definition of mood). This is to say, mood in Kakua
conforms to a cross-linguistic grammatical category that expresses something about
the speaker’s view of the proposition (c.f. Bybee 1990, Palmer 2001, Hengeveld
2004 for discussions of mood).
Hengeveld (2004) proposes a subdivision of the category of mood into
illocution and modality, illocution being “instances of specific types of speech acts”,
while modality is “concerned with the modification of the content of speech acts”
(Hengeveld 2004:1190). In the subsequent sections I follow Hengeveld’s division of
mood, and describe separately illocution and modality as categories of mood in
Kakua. The motivation for adopting Hengeveld’s division of mood categories is
mainly a semantic one. Dividing the mood markers in Kakua into two groups helpsTense, aspect, mood and evidentiality281to better describe their semantics: illocution markers are ‘unqualified’ expressions
of the speech acts, whereas modality markers do express the type of relationship,
expectations, or attitude of the speaker towards the content of these speech acts
(modality can “modify the content of the speech acts” ibid). Additionally, only the
group of illocution markers can constitute types of clauses. The same cannot be said
for the modality markers, which do not form types of clauses (there are no clauses
such as ‘frustrative clauses’ or ‘dubitative clauses’).
The semantics of these categories are described in the subsequent sections.
Section §10.4 describes grammatical morphemes encoding illocution, 5 and section
§10.5 describes the different morphemes expressing modality. Evidentiality is
presented separately in §10.6. Note that all three categories are considered to be part
of the overall mood category in Kakua.
A formal distinction between illocution and modality, as presented in
Hengeveld (2004), is that “in the expression of illocution the morphological category
of mood has to compete with word order and intonation as markers of particular
subdistinctions, whereas modality is expressed by mood markers only” (Hengeveld
2004:1190). As shown in the subsequent sections, although one of the illocution
morphemes comes along with a particular intonation, it is not necessarily the case
that illocution morphemes in Kakua, as opposed to modality morphemes, compete
in terms of word order and intonation with other subdistinctions. Rather, I will say
that the primary distinction between illocution markers and modality markers in
Kakua, is that, as stated above, illocution markers have the ability to indicate a clause
type, whereas modality markers does not.
Morphosyntactically, it cannot be said that there is a distinction that
characterizes one or the other type of mood. Although most of these markers have
their own dedicated morphosyntactic slots, and while most occur following the stem
(as suffixes or enclitics), there are some in prefixing position (specifically
evidentiality markers).","[301, 302]"
"350 A Grammar of Kakua13.2 Subordination
The combination of clauses in an asymmetric relation in Kakua is realized
through five main strategies. These are presented in the following table, indicating
which strategy is used for which kind of subordination:

xAs shown in Table 13.1 above, these five different subordinating strategies
are used to form three types of subordinate construction in Kakua. A canonical
description of subordination regards it as a particular type of combination of clauses,
such that one of them is syntactically and semantically dependent on the other (c.f.,
Langacker 1991, Cristofaro 2003). The subordinate clause functions as a constituent
of the higher clause. This presupposes a distinction between main clauses and
subordinate clauses. I follow here the general definitions of these three types of
subordinate constructions as defined in e.g. van Gijn et al (2011:3), Cristofaro
(2003), and Haumann (1997): complement clauses, which function as arguments of
the verb of the superordinate clause, are described in §13.5; relative clauses, which
function as modifiers of a noun phrase in the superordinate clause, are described in
§13.6, and adverbial clauses, which modify the verb of the higher clause or the higher
clause in its entirety, are described in §13.7.
As shown above, subordinate clauses in Kakua can often be identified by
morphological cues (suffixes, clitics, particles, or even verb roots): i.e., there are
morphological elements that serve to identify the subordinate clause in a complex
clause construction (Table 13.1). These elements, as introduced in Table 13.1, haveComplex Clauses351different syntactic positions with regard to the subordinate clause. They can be in
initial position of the subordinate clause (as with the temporal adverbial particle
tɨtimaʔ ‘then’), be cliticized to an element of the subordinate clause (as with switch
reference markers when used to link adverbial subordinate clauses, see §13.7 below),
suffixes (as with the subordinator suffix -ni, see §13.5 and §13.6 below), or as postor prepositions (as with the potential particle pînaʔ ‘POT’ see §13.7 below).
As presented in Chapter 11, the preferred order of constituents in Kakua is
that in which the predicate of the clause is in final position (S)OV. Adjuncts and
subordinate clauses tend to occur embedded in the main clause (see, however,
examples of exceptions to this in §13.4 for tail-head linkage, and in §13.5 for
complement clauses). The internal structure of the embedded clause also tends to
maintain the preferred OV order. Thus, in an asymmetric combination of clauses
(subordination), there are going to be two predicates, one pertaining to the
subordinated clause, and another one pertaining to the superordinate clause. A
structure similar to the following is typical for an asymmetric combination of clauses
in Kakua, where the square brackets refer to the subordinate clause in the
construction: (S)[(S)OV]OV.
The subordinate clause furthermore in the majority of cases precedes the
element that it modifies or is an argument of in the main clause. Thus, complement
clauses (§13.5) in the majority of cases precede the predicate of the main clause, as
follows: (S)[COMPLEMENT]V (see discussion of exceptions below). Likewise, relative
clauses (§13.6) tend to precede the N they modify, but relative clauses may also
follow their head. Example (14) illustrates a complement clause that precedes its
head, the predicate of the main clause.
14) Tê wěm=diɁ
[Marcela Ɂãhɨmat=diɁ] Ɂã=nǎwɁ-ap=be
Te 1SG=OBJ
Marcela
be.married=OBJ 3SG.M=tell-PST=REM.PST
‘Te tells me [that Marcela got married]’ (Ɂãhɨmat ‘be.married’ Ɂã=hɨm-at
3SG.M=exist-NMLZ)
Before turning to the specific description of the different types of subordinate
clauses in Kakua (complement, relative and adverbial clauses), the following
subsection, §13.3, focuses on the description of markers of switch reference in
Kakua, which play important roles in both main and subordinate clauses. A
subsection discussing bare verb roots, as introductory elements to subordinate
clauses, is given in §13.4. Finally, descriptions of complement clauses, relative
clauses, and adverbial clauses are given in §13.5, §13.6, and §13.7 respectively.
Causal constructions, which involve the use of a finite verb (and perhaps more
recently the repetition of a bare verb as a linking strategy to express causation), are
decribed in §13.8.","[370, 371, 372]"
"Finally, the conjunction of NPs, as with the conjunction of predicates
presented in (1)-(5) above, is also realized by the simple juxtaposition of theComplex Clauses347conjoined NPs. This is illustrated in (7) below (some other examples were given in
Chapter 5). The coordinated juxtaposed NPs are boldfaced:
7) tʃênewã=wɨt=hĩ
two=REP.EVID=REM.PSTʔã=ʔwěbʔheɲě3SG.M=older.brotherʔã=ʔɨ ̂dhĩ3SG.M=younger.brother
‘there were two of them (it is said), his older brother and his younger brother’13.1.2 Disjunctive coordination
Coordinated clauses expressing disjunction have two possible realizations.
They can be marked with the morpheme o (a loan from the disjunctive conjunction
o in Spanish),2 or by simple juxtaposition (asyndetic coordination). The use of
morpheme o as a marker of disjunction seems to be used more frequently among
younger speakers of Kakua. The simple juxtaposition strategy as a form of
disjunction is a more frequent strategy, especially among elder speakers.
Example (8) below comes from a conversation with one of the eldest Kakua
men. He does not use an overt marking for the disjunctive construction. The
interpretation as a disjunction is given by context. A conjunctive reading (‘and’) is
also possible, but in the example below, the speaker interpreted from the context that
the reading of the sentence should be that of disjunction:
8) wîʔi-kan
not.exist-NEGměm2SGhêjʔ-kan=na=kakětknow-NEG=DECL=ASS 3PLhêjʔ-kan=na=kaknow-NEG=DECL=ASS
‘no, you don’t know, or they don’t know (the story)’Example (9) shows the disjunction of NPs, also without a connector, although
the interpretation is that of a disjunctive construction:2The use of o as a disjunctive connector is found in many other languages of the Vaupés, whichmight suggest that its use in Kakua came from contact with perhaps Tukanoan languages (although itmust ultimately have a Spanish source). However, its predominant use by younger speakers in Kakua,
might also suggest that it was borrowed directly from Spanish.","[367, 368]"
"356 A Grammar of Kakua
beginning (the ‘head’) of the following sentence (c.f., Hopper 1979, Stirling 1993,
Guillaume 2011:110).10
Kakua uses tail-head linkage as a way to temporally connect sentences or
clauses together, to recapitulate parts of the previous sentence or clause that sets the
(simultaneous) beginning of the following sentence or clause. When using a predicate
as a ‘linker’ (or connector of a chain of clauses or sentences), most of the verbal
morphology can omitted, but it is not obligatorily omitted. The only verbal
morphology that must be omitted with predicates when these are functioning as
linkers are cross-referencing proclitics. Suffixes and enclitics, on the other hand,
seem to be allowed in these connecting predicates. An example of the repetition of
a predicate as a linking strategy is given below (see also example (20) above). The
translation given to the connecting predicates is usually that of ‘while VERBing’, or
‘once VERBed’, or ‘after VERBing’. The connecting predicate is boldfaced:
24) dettũp ʔã=t-jâj-ap=wɨt=hĩ
jâj=na
liana 3SG.M=pull-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST pull=DECLɲâw-ɲàʔ-berun-jump-gokǎn3SG.M
‘he pulled a liana, (after) pulling he ran off’
An interesting characteristic of this repetition of the predicate as a linking
strategy in Kakua is that many examples show the repetition of the object argument
as well. Examples of this are given in (25)-(26) below:
25) ʔã=ta-hɨjbi
ʔibi-bâdʔdaʔ
3SG.M=EVID-arrive.here uncle-deceasedhɨjbiarrive.herenɨmaʔbeh=nago.with.company=DECLʔã=ta-ʔɨbɁ-ɨp=hĩnaʔ-bâdʔdaʔ=diʔfwĩ=ʔin3SG.M=EVID-take.out-PST=REM.PST mom-deceased=OBJ
1PL=mom
‘the deceased uncle arrived here, arriving here with company he took our
deceased mom’10Some authors, e.g., Seifart (2010b) for Bora, include not only predicates, but also other linkingelements (such as pronouns) in the description of ‘tail-head linkage’ for specific languages.","[376, 377]"
"13.6 Relative Clauses
Relative clauses are clauses that modify an NP of the main clause (c.f.,
Keenan 1985, Van Valin 2005:183-224). In Kakua, relative clauses differ from
complement clauses in that they are marked with the relativizer suffix –ni/-nit12 (here
glossed as SUBR ‘subordinator’) that attaches to the predicate of the relative clause.
The relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. 13 When the relative clause is
modifying the object argument of the main clause, the object marker may also occur
on the relative clause (e.g. (35) below). The relativized noun phrase can be the
subject, or object (as in (35)-(36) below) within the relative clause. There is no
relative pronoun in Kakua, and as the examples below show, the subordinator suffix
marks the predicate of the relative clause:
34) [fin
yesterdaytêw-ni]work-SUBRnewěmanɁã=wɨn-at3SG.M=die-NMLZɁã=beh-ep=be3SG.M=go-PST=REC.PST
‘the man [who worked yesterday] died’ (the man who worked yesterday went
to his death)
35) [ʧɨ ̂=diɁ
pineapple=OBJhěmɁ-ni]=diɁeat-SUBR=OBJɲɨj=diɁopossum=OBJɁĩ=mâw-ap=be3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
‘they killed the opossum [that ate the pineapple]’12Note the (near) homophony of this morpheme with other functional morphemes in Kakua: theinterrogative clitic =nit ‘INTERR’ (Chapter 8), agent nominalizer suffix -ni ‘A.NMLZ’ (Chapter 4),collective plural -nit ‘PL’ (Chapter 4), and same subject clitic =nit ‘S.S’ (Chapter 8 and section §13.3
above). The homophony of morphemes in Kakua has been seen also for other morphemes (e.g., declarative=na, inanimate plural number -na; emphatic =bǔ and locative =bǔ). The extent to which all of the
-ni/=nit forms might have a historic relation hasn’t been explored yet. Finally, the variants -ni ~ -nit as
complementizer suffixes seem to have free variation even within one and the same speaker. Since I did
not test for a context in which one form would be preferred over the other, a more systematic study should
be undertaken in future research on Kakua.
13According to Dryer (2013), relative clauses preceding the noun are rather uncommon outsideof Asia. He also points out that typologically languages in which the relative clause precedes the noun are
also verb-final languages, which is true for Kakua.",[381]
"1.6Kakua dialects and clansKakua is subdivided into two main dialect areas: the Kakua spoken in the
areas surrounding the village of Wacará, and the Kakua spoken in the areas
surrounding Nuevo Pueblo. These two areas have some degree of dialectal variation
occurring mainly in their lexicon and phonology.
The most salient phonological differences that I was able to perceive are a
correspondence between the Wacará́ [ʧ] to [ts] in Nuevo Pueblo, and Wacará́ [a] to
Nuevo Pueblo [ɨ]. The first of these two correspondences occurs everywhere in the
lexicon where these sounds are found. The second correspondence occurs mainly in
the following: Wacará kǎnɁ ‘3SG.F’ and -kan ‘NEG’, corresponds to Nuevo Pueblo
kɨnɁ ‘3SG.F’ and -kɨn ‘NEG’. It also occurs with the assertion marker, which for Kakua
of Wacará is =ka, while for Kakua of Nuevo Pueblo is =kɨ.11 A discussion
11 Note that /a/, /ɨ/ and /k/ are attested phonemes in both dialects. With further research ondialectal variation it would be interesting to test if at some point there was a diachronic process in whichIntroduction: Kakua and its speakers17regarding differences in deixis between these two forms of assertion marking is
found in Chapter 8.
Additionally, the Kakua people of Nuevo Pueblo express a spatial or temporal
deictic difference in the assertion clitic. Whenever the referent is located or the event
is occurring near the speaker, the assertion form of the clitic is =ka ‘ASS.PROX’;
when the referent is located or the event occurs further away from the speaker, the
assertion form is =kɨ ‘ASS.DIST’.
Another phonological difference between the Kakua spoken in Wacará and
the Kakua spoken in Nuevo Pueblo, is that the Wacará varieties have completely
merged the /o/ and /u/ phonemes into one single /u/ phoneme. The difference is
maintained in the varieties of Kakua spoken in Nuevo Pueblo.
Given that my work concentrated on the village of Wacará, at this point I
cannot provide further details on dialectal variation. For example, no grammatical
features such as morphosyntactic or further phonological features were studied
during the time when the data for this grammar was being collected.
In each of the dialect areas, different clans also have different clan-dialect
variations. This was not studied either. Below I only list the clans of speakers of the
Kakua spoken in Wacará.́ Some of these clans, such as the hɨ ̌wɁwã clan are originally
from the area of Nuevo Pueblo, and speakers of this clan, though having been born
in Wacará, still use many of the dialectal differences (lexical and phonological) found
in the Kakua variety spoken in Nuevo Pueblo.
All Kakua clan names are invariably marked with the plural number marker
for animate entities –wã ‘PL.AN’:

it was said, are the ones who still speak like the forefathers, with strong tonal
distinctions and a slow paused speech, the tõjdaʔwã clan “almost don’t erase sounds”
when speaking.
a merger of /ɨ/ and /a/ occurred in one dialect, conditioned by preceding /k/, giving birth to the sole form
=ka in the variants of Kakua spoken in Wacará, and keeping the difference of =ka ~ =kɨ in the variants
of Kakua spoken in Nuevo Pueblo.","[38, 39]"

"5 This is a distinct group from the Bará people, speakers of an Eastern Tukanoan language of theVaupés, spoken in the Pirá-Paraná region. The etymology of this ethnonym is not clear4A Grammar of KakuaThe Kakua people have been locally referred to as Makú de Cubeo, Makú de
Desano, or Makú de Wanano, or generally as ‘Makú’. In the literature, they have
also been referenced as Bará (Silverwood-Cope, 1972) and as Cacua.
The term ‘Makú’ has been used by the River people in the Vaupés region to
refer to any forest-dwelling group of people, or people from the forest in general,
regardless of their ethnicity or language (c.f., Jackson 1983:149, and other
discussions found in Ospina 2002 for Yuhup, and Epps 2008 for Hup. See also V.
Martins 2005 on reference to the ‘eastern Makú’ branch, and Mahecha et al. 199697 on additional discussion of the term Makú. Epps & Bolaños submitted, offer also
discussion of the term Makú used as a linguistic classification to group many
unrelated forest-dweller peoples). The term Makú in itself has a very strong
pejorative connotation, and is even used as an insult among peoples in the region.
The term probably has an Arawak origin with the meaning of ‘those who do not talk’
or ‘do not speak’ (e.g. Arawak Baniwa-Curripaco ma-aku ‘NEG-speak’; see KochGrünberg 1906:877; see also discussions in Martins & Martins 1999: 251, Ramirez
2001a:198, Epps & Bolaños submitted. See also Ospina 2002:16 for alternative
suggestions on the origin of the ‘Makú’ term).
As opposed to the ‘forest people’, the ‘river people’ live along the main rivers
or main streams and cultivate large agricultural fields (compared to that of the
Makú’s). Their protein sources are obtained primarily from fishing, and this has
made them experienced river navigators able to face the wild rapids of the Vaupés
River.
Forest people, in turn, are expert navigators of the land. They are perceived
as quick and silent in the forest and able to face long nights walking and sleeping in
the forest without being noticed by the river peoples. Their experience with water,
however, is less developed and constantly invites mockery from the river peoples.
Forest people are both feared and looked down upon by River peoples.
Because they are considered to be socially inferior, they are hardly considered worth
referring to. However, because of their astuteness when dealing with the inhospitable
forest, the same river people who look at them with pity, fear them as well.
Because the Kakua people have relied strongly on hunting and gathering for
their subsistence they are also called ‘Makú’ (as mentioned, the term ‘Makú’ is
applied to all the hunting-gathering forest peoples of the region). Different from most
of their neighbors, peoples from Eastern Tukanoan and Arawak speaking groups, the
Kakua peoples have a highly mobile lifestyle, engaging in long trekking, and hunting
trips that can last from one day to many months. Additionally, family groups often
organize trips to visit other family members either to the village of Nuevo Pueblo,
or to inland places where they spend time together, hunting and gathering forest
goods. These trips may last a few months, or even years.
The connotations of the term ‘Makú’ is thus negative now and as far as we
know has always been so. In the broader social context of Colombia, being
indigenous is synonymous to being an inferior person, poor and naïve. Calling
someone an Indian in the urban context has very negative overtones. When
indigenous peoples in the Colombian Vaupés become aware of the social
embarrassment entailed in being indigenous, they claim not to be so, replying oftenIntroduction: Kakua and its speakers5that the ‘Makú’ people are the real Indians, and not them (“indio yo? no, indios los
Makú, yo no!”).
I have also witnessed a fight among children in an Eastern Tukanoan village
of Desanos, where the ultimate insult culminating the fight was when one of the
children involved called the other one ‘Makú’, reinforcing his insult saying “you are
just like those Kakua savages!”
Likewise, in many of my trips to the area, whenever I have told people that I
frequently visit the Kakua people, I am questioned with high astonishment: why do
I want to visit forest people? and what is really so interesting about them? The
implication is as if they were almost animal-like creatures.
When I first visited the Kakua village of Nuevo Pueblo, I was greeted by the
Kakua in the Desano language.6 When I replied back speaking in Kakua people
looked at me with disbelief and insisted a few more times in Desano. Once it was
clear to them that I could not understand a word of Desano, the first person
addressing me stepped back and with a look of unpleasant surprise on her face she
asked again, this time in Kakua, “are you really understanding our language? Can
you really not understand the language of the patrons?”. This seems to have been a
big disappointment not only for the Kakua people, but for the Desano people as well.
Many times during my stays in Nuevo Pueblo I was addressed in Desano, and people
seemed not to be able to get over the fact that I could not speak Desano but was
trying to make my way into Kakua.
Finally, from my own observations in the Tukano village of Piracuara at the
basin of the Papurí River, the Hup people –also considered Makú, and with whom
the Kakua people of Nuevo Pueblo have social relationships and even some cases of
intermarriage– represent the more numerous population in the village. Nonetheless,
the Tukanoans maintain control and make primary decisions in this village. At the
local school, children are given meals twice daily during the school program. The
Hup children will only eat after the Tukanoan children have already eaten and been
served. This serves as a good illustration of the lower class position of the ‘Makú’
people vis à vis their regional neighbors.
These experiences are not very different from what has been documented in
the ethnographic literature of the peoples of the area. For example, Jackson
(1983:159) mentions specific cases when the ‘Makú’ are referred to as animal-like
creatures.
The ‘Makú’ people overall are considered to have a socially inferior status,
and their socio-economic relationship with the other indigenous groups of the area
(Eastern Tukanoans and Arawak groups) is clearly unbalanced.
6 The Kakua people of Nuevo Pueblo have had intense contact interactions with the Desanopeople in the nearby village of Wainambí. In fact, people from Wainambí may ‘make use’ of the Kakuas
as they wish. If the Desano people are in need of force of labor, for example, they don’t ask for a favor
from the Kakua; instead, they demand the number of Kakua people that they need and give them directions
on what to do. Kakua people from Nuevo Pueblo refer to the Desano people from Wainambí as their
patrons.","[25, 26, 27]"
"10.6.3 Second-hand evidentiality
The categories of visual (unmarked) and nonvisual, described above, can be
described as firsthand evidential categories. Additionally, Kakua has two other
categories which indicate that the proposition was not directly experienced by the
speaker. These two categories of ‘second-hand’ evidence express inferences and
reported evidence. Each of these has specific morphemes, =ta (with its allomorph
=tagǎ) and =dê for inference (§10.6.4 below), and =wɨt for reported evidentiality
(§10.6.5 below). These two second-hand categories may co-occur with a prefix,
which indicates inferential evidentiality in general, without specifying whether or
not this inference is based on some else’s report or not, and which can be used on
its own. The co-occurrence of the second hand prefixes and reported or inferred
envidentiality clitics is not obligatory.
This prefix has three allomorphs: t- ~ ti-, and t- ~ ta- and are all glossed as
‘EVID’. The forms t- ~ ti- co-occur with the reported evidential clitic =wɨt, and the
forms t- ~ ta- co-occur with the inferred evidential clitics =ta, =tagǎ. Both prefixing
forms ti- and ta- typically undergo a phonological reduction to t-. It is possible that
in a future stage of the language the difference between the two forms ti- and ta- will
be lost, and only the form t- will survive to encode second-hand evidentiality, where
further specification for inference or reportative will be required (as it is in
synchronic Kakua). Moreover, the difference between ti- and ta- is only rarely made
by elder speakers, and younger speakers only use the prefixed form t- for both
inference and reportative evidentiality. Thus, because of this possible future path
towards a neutralization of the prefixed forms into one single ‘second-hand’
evidentiality marker in need of further specification, I propose that these are
synchronically different markers, but will at some point merge together into one.
Even for the elder generation that still makes the difference between ti- and
ta-, the difference seem to be made exclusively when a clitic of inference or
reportative is not present. In the remaining cases when the clitics for inference or
reportative are marked, then the prefixing forms ti- or ta- seem to be more rarely
marked fully as such, and are rather found as t-.
A few examples are shown below. More examples of the co-occurrence of
the second-hand prefix with clitics of inference or reported evidentiality can be found
below in §10.6.4 and §10.6.5 respectively.",[319]
"116A Grammar of KakuaIn Kakua, most attributive or quality meanings are expressed through
descriptive verbs. A small set of words which are not verbs and can be used directly
in attributive modification, however, can be identified.
The small set of adjectives in Kakua is formed by a total of four adjectives.
Morphologically, these words can take both verb and noun morphology.
Syntactically, the adjective words have a fairly free order and the modifier can occur
either preceding or following the modified noun.
The adjectives have a likely etymology in verbs, as discussed at the end of
this section. The four Kakua adjectives are given in (53) belowː
53) hàphâp
bɨdǐ
jehěp‘tall/up’
‘new’
‘big’
‘bad’All other qualities or attributive meanings in the language are expressed by
descriptive verbs. When a descriptive verb is used for expressing an attribute or
quality, the verb root is marked with the adjectivizer morpheme –ni following the
modified noun in juxtaposition.
The class of adjectives is distinct from verbs and nouns. Unlike verbs,
adjectives can occur as free morphemes without the need of derivational morphology
to function as modifiers of nouns. Unlike nouns, adjectives can take all of the verbal
morphology, and may function as heads of verb phrases.
The syntactic position of the four adjective words in Kakua is apparently not
fixed, and whereas some speakers prefer an N Adj order, others have no clear
preference for either one, accepting both as being just as good. It must be said,
however, that allowing for either order to occur is much more common in elicitations
than in natural texts, where the modifier tends to follow the modified noun. This
might be explained in that the four adjectives in Kakua have an etymological source
in verbs, and Kakua is predominantly a verb-final language.
The examples in (54) and (55) below illustrates a case in which the same
speaker uses indistinctly both Adj N and N Adj orders in the same narrative text:

When descriptive verbs function as attributive modifiers, they are adjectivized
by the adjectivizer suffix –ni.
The following examples in (59) and (60) below illustrate this adjectival
function of descriptive verbs. Note also the order of constituents where the predicate
remains in final position whereas the adjectivized verb precedes the verb phrase.

regional languages (see also nominalization via compounding of classifiers to verbs described in chapter4), these adjectives can also occur as head of a NP without the classifiers, as can be seen in example (4)above.","[137, 138, 139]"

De Vries (2005:376f), in a typological study of tail-head linkage in Papuan
languages, reports that in some of those languages, instead of repeating the last
predicate of the ‘tail’ clause, the tail-head linkage is formed by using a verb meaning
‘do’ or ‘be’ (translating into ‘having done that/so’ or ‘being so’). This type of linkage
strategy de Vries labels ‘generic verb linkage’.11 Similar to this, Kakua often uses
the verb pêa ‘finish’ as the linking ‘generic’ verb instead of repetition of the same
predicate in the ‘tail’ clause is used. This strategy in Kakua serves as a temporal
linkage of clauses, indicating the temporal sequence of the events. The translation
given in these constructions is ‘after finishing VERB’, referring to the completion of
the event expressed by the predicate of the ‘tail’ clause. See the following example:

THIS=OBJ
be.good-be.good=DECL
‘to this base of the blowgun hammer until it exits across, finishing, do well this
one’

"120A Grammar of Kakuaa separate class from verbs and nouns. Finally, adjectives in Kakua can function as
verbs, taking all the available verbal morphology, suggesting that adjectives in Kakua
have a verbal origin.
The same argument given above to account for the derivation of the adjective
words hâp ‘new’, and hap ‘tall/up’, can serve to explain the diachronic development
of the adjective word jehěp ‘bad’. It could be argued that jehěp ‘bad’ is a lexicalized
form from the verb jěh ‘be.damaged’ plus the general past marker –Vp: jěh-ep
‘be.damaged-PST’. Because of phonological processes, the realization of a rising tone
in a bisyllabic morpheme is assigned to the last syllable, and thus, the tone of the
verb root jěh ‘be.damaged’ has its realization in the last syllable when it has been
lexicalized as a bisyllabic adjective jehěp.
The word jehěp can function as an adjective or as a verb, as shown in (70).

Perhaps the least etymologically transparent of the four adjectives in Kakua
is bɨdǐ ‘big’. However, even when its source is not clear, the fact that it can occur
both as a verb and as a free form (adjective), without the need of the adjectivizer
marker –ni, can serve as a sign to suspect its verbal origin. I acknowledge, however
that it is cross-linguistically common for adjective to share properties with either
nouns or verbs. My argument is based on the large number of descriptive verbs that
in Kakua serve to describe properties of nouns.
The examples in (71)-(73) below illustrate the adjective bɨdǐ ‘big’ used as an
attributive modifier (with animate and inanimate entities):

Like some verbs, the adjective bɨdǐ can also function as an adverb. When
functioning as an adverb, bɨdǐ occurs at the beginning of the clause, as in examples
(74) and (75) below, and its semantic meaning is that of ‘very much’:Types of morphemes and word classeŝ

The main features of the closed class of adjectives can be listed as follows:
a) Adjectival concepts in Kakua are generally expressed through descriptive verbs.
b) Attributive modification is expressed by adjectivized verbs, noun compounding
or noun classification.
c) The adjectivizer suffix is –ni. It can be attached to (descriptive) verb roots to
form adjectives. When attached to other verb roots (other than descriptive
verbs), it can also function as agent nominalization.
d) The adjective or adjectivized element has free syntactic order, although normally
it follows the modified element, it may also precede it.
e) The four adjectives identified in Kakua are items expressing the notions of ‘big’,
‘tall/up’, ‘new’, and ‘bad’. These four forms can be used as free forms (as
attributive concepts or modifiers), or as heads of a predicative construction.
f) The four attested adjectives do not take pronominal prefixes.
g) They share a number of features with verbs and some other features with nouns.
Unlike nouns, adjectives can take verbal morphology and can be nominalized.
And unlike verbs, adjectives can take nominal morphology.
h) Adjectives are synchronically monomorphemic, but some are probably
historically derived3.3.6 Adverbs
Like in the case for quality or attributive modification, modification of verbs
and clauses in Kakua is mostly expressed by verbs. However, there is a set of words
that are not verbs and that can also serve to modify verbs and clauses. These adverbs
are morphosyntactically different from verbs and nouns.
Although most members of this set of words have a clear etymological source
in verbs, they can be morphosyntactically distinguished from verbs in that they can
occur as free morphemes, whereas verbs must always occur with additional
inflectional morphology (see Chapter 8 for discussion of the exceptional cases when
verb roots can occur as free morphemes).
Most adverbs can constitute a sentence on their own, like nouns. Unlike
nouns, however, some adverbs cannot take case marking. Also, unlike nouns,
adverbs can take verbal morphology.
On the basis of their syntactic behavior adverbs can be divided into two sets.
A set of adverbs that occurs at the beginning of the clause they modify, and a set of
adverbs that occur as particles at the end of the clause that they modify.","[141, 142, 143]"
"13.1 Coordination
13.1.0 Introduction
The structure of a coordinated construction is in itself a symmetrical structure
(c.f., Cristofaro 2003). This means that, as opposed to subordination (§13.2-§13.7),
in a coordinated construction the coordinated elements do not depend either
grammatically or semantically on each other; i.e., the elements of a coordinated
construction may function as independent clauses on their own (c.f. van Gijn et al
2011:1-24; Cristofaro 2003). Kakua uses mainly two strategies to coordinate
independent clauses: i) juxtaposition, ii) the use of morphemes which serve as
indicators (coordinators) of the relationship between the coordinated clauses. As
opposed to verb serialization, coordination in Kakua serves to express different1The use of the term ‘coordinator particle’ instead of simply ‘conjunction’ is preferred herebecause the term ‘conjunction’ is used here for one of the types of coordination (§13.1), contrasting with,
e.g., ‘disjunction’, or ‘adversative’ types of coordination.",[364]
