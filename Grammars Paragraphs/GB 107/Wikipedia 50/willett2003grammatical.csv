7.5 Negation
Payne (1997:282) describes a negative clause as “one which asserts that
some event, situation, or state of affairs does not hold”. A pan-Salish analysis of
clausal negation has appeared in H. Davis 2001 where three major patterns of
negation are identified in the family. As H. Davis indicates, Nxa?amxcin
exemplifies two patterns.",[335]
"Pattern A consists of a negative particle followed by anominalized clause, as shown in the following examples:

I didn’t eat.",[335]
"W.4.92lat= nim’asAll three of the above clauses contain the negation particle Jut followed by a
nominalized predicate.",[335]
The negation particle Jut appears at thebeginning of the clause followed by a nominalized predicate.,[343]
"W.9.16lutW.1.37Like (206) to (208), the above clauses contain both the negation particle Jut and
a predicate marked for irrealis mode. In (209) to (211), however, the predicate is
not nominalized.",[343]
"H. Davis’s pattern C involves the negation particle lut followed by an

"This is a feature distinguishing the two patterns of negation inIn H. Davis’s 2001 analysis, Pattern A negation is comprised of thenegation element followed by a nominalized clause.",[344]
"Selkirk recognizes an “apparent need for particular rule statements; a
general X’ schema for compounding does not adequately characterize the
compounding possibilities found in English” (p.13). Anderson claims that
compounds are created by a set of word structure rules which “have much the
same form as phrase-structure rules, but apply only to lexical categories. Word
Structure Rules operate to specify the internal constituency of lexical categories
and (optionally) their heads” (p.299). Both Anderson and Selkirk agree that
these rules must be specific enough so as to rule out any gaps present in the
compounds of a language. Possible stem combinations as well as the feature of
“headedness” are very much language-specific, therefore what is available in the
grammar of a particular language should be encoded in its word structure rules.
For example, a compound of the lexical category verb comprising a verb stem and
a noun stem would be realized by the following Word Structure Rule:dg)VoOVNThe word structure rule in (1) indicates that a verb stem and a noun stem can
combine to form a single lexical item of the category verb. The head of the
compound is underlined.
The semantic interpretation of a compound is closely tied with the conceptof head.",[350]

CD.7Having briefly introduced several grammatical points in relation to the
noun phrase (determiners, demonstratives, oblique, locative and genitivemarking), I now turn to the structure of Nxa?amxcin clauses, starting first with
simple clauses in the following section.
5.3 Simple Clauses
Nxa?amxcin falls under the traditional classification of ‘polysynthetic’.
Words in polysynthetic languages are typically long and morphologically
complex, with a single word being able to express the full semantic content of a
complete sentence in a non-polysynthetic language.","[105, 106]"
"10
components of the grammar, either in the sense of being two separate ‘places’
where words and sentences respectively are derived, or in the sense of being two
(at least partially) distinct sets of principles (Sproat 1985; Baker 1988[a])”.
Instead, she claims that both words and sentences can be formed within a single
modular framework with the appropriate principles. The formation of words can
be accounted for (with some modifications) within the X-bar framework proposed
for the formation of clauses by Jackendoff (1977), Chomsky (1981) and Stowell
(1981).","[22, 23]"
"Viewpoint aspect, mood, temporal marking, negation, non-declarative operations—yes/no questions, imperative, prohibitive—and
nominalization are also discussed.
A description of the three different types of compounds found inNxa’amxcin—two involving free stems and the third (known as lexical
affixation) comprising a free stem and a bound stem—is provided along with the
corresponding word structure rules responsible for these compounds.",[3]
"W.7.186com’d4l
justnowwwawlx
talk-(3AB)
W.11.1.1The particle sa?k generally surfaces with a post-vocalic glottal; however, as
example (138) indicates, the glottal is omitted in some cases.
7.3.4Probability
Probability is generally subsumed under the label epistemic modalitywhich Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994:179) describe as follows:
Epistemic modality applies to assertions and indicates the extent to which
the speaker is committed to the truth of the proposition. The unmarked
case in this domain is total commitment to the truth of the proposition, and
markers of epistemic modality indicate something less than a total
commitment by the speaker to the truth of the proposition.",[331]
"Section 7.3briefly addressed the category mood, more specifically the operation marking
irrealis along with various particles used to mark potential, deontic and
probability.",[348]
"W.4.90The above examples illustrate prohibitives that follow the A pattern for negation
marking as described in H. Davis 2001.",[343]
"Given this definition one might expect to find simplyimperative and negation marking as the morphological realization of prohibitives
in Nxa?amxcin.",[342]
"324
The exact difference between pattern A and C negation in Nxa?amxcin
remains to be determined.","[336, 337]"
"The nominalizedpredicates in (206) to (208) are marked irrealis as required for prohibitive clauses.
The following examples illustrate prohibitives that follow H. Davis’s C
pattern of negation:

Examples (103) and (104) suggest that the following word structure rule ispresent in the language:(105)VoVVThe rule in (105) indicates that two verb stems can combine to form a complex
verb stem.
In the previous section we saw consistency between word structure rules
used to form a?-, unmarked and right-edge bound stem compounds.",[376]
"Temporal markers indicating past and future were discussed insection 7.4 followed by negation in 7.5. Three operations subsumed under the
label non-declarative—interrogative (yes/no questions), imperative and
prohibitive—are the focus of section 7.6. Finally nominalization, previously
discussed as a derivational operation in chapter 6, is considered as an inflectional
operation in section 7.7.
The following chapter addresses compound formation in Nxa?amxcin, a
process that takes place before any derivational or inflectional operations are
realized.",[348]
"92.78115
Both (155) and (156) are intransitive constructions and we see the wa particle
surfacing to the left of the subject NP.(157) and (158) contain transitivepredicates and the wa particle surfaces to the left of the object NP.
Topical object constructions are interesting in that the reverse is true.

the suffix -wa (reduced to -u when unstressed).","[127, 128]"
"331
7.7 Nominalized Constructions
In section 6.5.1.1 I discussed the derivational operation of nominalization
which was marked by the prefix s-. This operation can also take place at the level
of syntax and appears to be triggered by certain syntactic contexts.
As pointed out in section 7.5, negation can trigger nominalization of the
negated predicate.

"The first, and probably most common interpretation, is that ofrepetition, which can be expressed in a number of ways.",[285]

Conversely, it is possible for a form to be present without any associated
meaning.",[35]

indicators of potential mood, as discussed in section 7.3.2.
Having provided a brief outline of mood in Nxa?amxcin, I now turn to a
discussion of the temporal markers.
7.4 TemporalIndications of past and future in Nxa?amxcin come from temporal markers.
It is generally assumed that there is no category tense in Salish. This assumption
is largely based on the fact that unmarked clauses can have a past or present
interpretation.",[332]
"If we compare bivalent active clauses with the bivalenttopical object construction we find that the distribution of the particle wa is the
exact reverse.",[167]
"W.11.8.117These examples are almost identical, but there is a reverse order of the mood and
temporal particles. This is the case for other mood particles as well, as variations
in ordering can be found throughout the data.",[330]
"In the following section I turn to a discussion of the particle wa and its
distribution in both simple clauses and fronting constructions.
5.6 The Particle wa
The particle wa has previously been referred to as an absolutive marker by
Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998) and Willett (1996). Willett has specifically
argued that wa optionally surfaces when a maximal projection has an absolutive
case feature.",[127]
"In example (53), the Ist person sg.subject is marked by the intransitive clitic kn. Again, there is no overt intransitive
subject pronoun.
When overt noun phrases are expressed, the basic transitive word order is
VOS, although there is some flexibility of word order as shown in the following
examples:

"CW&B1996:12In (203) both the lexical suffix =atx” ‘house’ and the independent noun
stax”tox™il ‘houses’ appear in the same clause filling the same argument role.
However, stox”tox”il must be marked oblique by the particle t. Otherwise the
construction in ungrammatical. The same is true for example (204) whichcontains the lexical suffix =atp ‘tree’ and the noun c’aq’atps ‘his fir tree’. In
order for c’aq’dtps to appear in this construction it must be marked oblique.
The contrast in doubling facts between Nxa?amxcin bound stems and
Mohawk incorporated nouns suggests that the syntactic structures of the clauses
in these two languages are different.
8.4.4.2.2 Stranding
Baker (1996:308) states that incorporated nouns “can be modified by
elements that appear outside of the verb”.",[422]
"5.5.2 Quasi-Clefting
Kroeber (1999:365) describes quasi-clefting in Salish languages as
“fronting constructions in which the residue takes the form of some type of
subordinate clause other than a headless relative clause; the difference from
relative clauses may be in the inflection or in the initial particle or both”.
In Nxa?amxcin, quasi-cleft constructions are formed with a clefted element
appearing in initial position, followed by one of the subordinating particles, tu? or
ci, followed by a relative clause which is optionally marked by the oblique marker
t. This is schematized in (113):(113)NP;suB(t)pl_i]Pj
Some examples of quasi-clefted transitive subjects are given below.

"Heprovides a number of syntactic and semantic tests as a guideline for
distinguishing between N+V combinations that are formed in the syntax and
those that are formed in the lexicon.
Baker claims that true noun incorporation is found in polysynthetic
languages—languages that are subject to the Morphological Visibility Condition(MVC) (1996:286):
(194)Morphological Visibility Condition

morpheme in the word containing Y.",[417]
"They both contain the predicate ‘towait for’, but the speaker in (544) uses the prefix k’#- while the speaker in (545)
uses the prefix kt-. Examples (546) to (548) also illustrate the positional meaning
associated with k’?-, but the speaker has chosen to use k#- instead.
Like the positional prefix k-, the prefix k’?- can surface on predicates
involving some kind of communicative event, the following example:
(549)k?tk*dncntx’
k?4-k”an=cin-nt-x”
POS-grab=language-TR-(3AB)-2sS
You repeated what he said. / You answered him.6.6.1.5 n-/naThis positional prefix, which Kinkade (1999) glosses as ‘into, onto’, is the
first in this list of locatives to involve two variants: na- and n-. It is not clear
which of these is underlying, but their distribution is predictable.
Examples (550) to (552) below illustrate both forms of the n(a)- positional
prefix:
(550) kn_—naq’iltc’a?
na-q’il=atc’a?
Iss + POS-ache=inside

"Although bake isclearly an independent form in the language and -er and -s bound affixes, with
respect to word formation each of these forms are considered to belong to one
group. They are all minimal forms, hence they are all morphemes.
The next major assumption of a morpheme-based approach to word
formation is that all morphemes constitute signs, meaning that all features of a

CD.26As we will see in section 5.6, the position of the particle wa in (21) suggests that

predicate.

Oblique marking appears with noun phrases that do not have any direct

7.3 Mood
According to Bybee (1985:28), mood “refers to the way the speaker
presents the truth of the proposition in the discourse and real-world context”.
The operations that actually fall under this definition can vary from one author to
another.","[322, 323]"
"Kroeber (1999:33-36)The general claim is that at the lexical level there aretwo distinct categories [+V, -N] and [-V, +N], even though these categories may
have fewer properties distinguishing them from each other than in other language
families.
While the general debate has focused on nouns vs. verbs, the status of
adjectives in the grammar is also questionable.3Consider the followingNxa?amxcin examples:

marked for irrealis mood.",[342]
"In direct active clauses, this particle marks the object of transitivesand the subject (with some possible restrictions) of intransitives.",[167]
"The others — potential, deontic, and probability — are marked byparticles, small (mono or bisyllabic) words which Kinkade (1981b:32) notes “may
not be inflected and, in Salishan languages, may not be predicative”.
7.3.1IrrealisIrrealis is a highly productive category in Nxa?amxcin and any thorough
analysis of its distribution spills over into the syntax of the language. In his
discussion of realis/irrealis mode, Payne (1997:244) gives the following definition:
A prototypical realis mode strongly asserts that a specific event or state of
affairs has actually happened, or actually holds true. A prototypical irrealis
mode makes no such assertion whatsoever. Irrealis mode does not
necessarily assert that an event did not take place or will not take place. It
simply makes no claims with respect to the actuality of the event or
situation described.
Irrealis examples are often glossed in the Salish literature as ‘unrealized’ (e.g.
Kinkade and Mattina 1981, Kinkade 1996a) or as ‘future’ (e.g. N. Mattina1999a).given below:
