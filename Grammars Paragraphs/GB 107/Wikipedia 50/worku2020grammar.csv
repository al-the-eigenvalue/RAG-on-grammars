"533Chapter 1313.1NegationIntroductionTypologically, negation constructions in Mursi show various striking features. In
Mursi, a number of different negation strategies may be employed to negate verbal
constituents. The strategies vary depending on grammatical systems or categories such
as aspect, mood, and person-subject. For instance, a verb in the imperfective aspect can
be negated by bound circumclitics while a verb in the perfective aspect is negated by
independent perfective negative particle ŋànì <NEG.PERV> ‘not, not yet, still’ plus by
the negative enclitic =ó attached to the perfective verb root. For instance, a verb in the
imperfective aspect can be negated by bound circumclitics [ŋà=…=ó] ~
<ŋà=ROOT.IMPERV=ó>, while a perfective verb can be negated by independent
perfective negative form particle ŋànì <NEG.PERV> ‘not, not yet’ and by the negative
enclitic attached to the root ~ <ŋànì k(V)-ROOT.PERV=ó>. So, when the negative is a
perfective verb, only the negator enclitic =ó will be utilized. A further interesting point
here is that in a negative imperative, only the negator proclitic ŋà= will be used thus
the enclitic =ó can be replaced by markers of other grammatical categories appropriate
to that slot such as number and verb-final suffix.
The grammatical function of the k(V)- prefix when negating a perfective verb is to
refer to first person subject. Besides, the subjunctive which often times applies to the
third person irrealis mood can be indicated by the same prefix. This prefix cannot occur
if the negated verb involves second person subject.
Furthermore, negative declarative clauses have an obligatory SV/AOV constituent
order, in which negated verbs always occur clause-finally. This is confined to the
negative clause constituent order, which is different from the affirmative canonical
534constituent SV/AVO order. The negation system that operates in the imperfective
aspect will have AO[Neg=V=Neg] while the perfective aspect have AO Neg.PART
[V=Neg].
Therefore, this chapter provides a detailed account of negators which occur in bound as
well as independent forms. Accordingly, bound negators are discussed in §13.2
followed by various independent negator words or particles in §13.3.","[556, 557, 558]"
"12.5 Polar questions
The term polar question is a more appropriate label than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ question (Dixon
2012: 377). As Dixon argues, some languages may lack words ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in their
lexicon and Mursi is one of them. Instead Mursi utilizes default interjections, negative
particle word/particle or copula verbs ― see the examples given in (12.43a-c).

Like in interrogative words, in polar questions, a constituent which is the focus takes
sentence-final position. In other words, it is the constituent with a raised intonation that
is expected to take the focus position and this could be by moving the constituent to the
right most slot of the clause ―for example kíɲáŋ in (12.43a). In polar questions, if the
sentence involves copula verb, obviously the copula complement will be a constituent
upon which a high pitch rests, as in (12.43c).

studentIn almost all cases, the syntactic order of constituents of declarative sentence and polar
questions are exactly the same. The English equivalents to the Mursi interjections in
above examples will be ɪmm ‘no’ and ɪɲɲ ‘yes’. It is quite common for interjections to
have a different phonology. For instance, both of these interjections contain a short
central vowel which is not part of the sound system of the language and may have a
monosyllabic VCG shape (where G stands for geminates).
When a intransitive clause is set to indicate a polar questions, it is on the intransitive
verb that the high pitch level can be shown, ― otherwise the verb remains high-toned
in most cases.

Positive declarative sentences are not the only syntactic structures that have identical
order of constituents with polar questions, negative declarative sentences have also
identical order. Thus in negative polar interrogative and negative declarative sentences,
the verb is placed in focus position at the end of the sentence, as in (12.45a-b).

The fact that both positive and negative polar interrogatives are equivalent in a way

CUASEkéQOUTNow the negated verb is within a direct speech report and has been negated in the same
way as a negative imperative, which is formed using imperfective verb root preceded
by negative imperfective proclitic ŋà= followed by singular imperative suffix -i. The
direct speech introduced by the quotative marker ké is a negative imperative given to
second person singular addressee.
Negative relative clauses in Mursi follow the same syntactic pattern of affirmative
relative clauses. It is very plausible to assume that almost all negative relative clauses
come out of noun modification forms structured by a gapping strategy.

In (13.9a), the second person singular bound pronoun suffix is -i and it undergoes a
vowel height harmony change. So i has became e following the negator enclitic =ó. In
negative conditional clauses, the verb of the subordinate clause cannot be negated,
rather the perfective negative particle ŋànì always occurs preceding it. As can be seen
in the examples above, it makes sense for conditional clauses to operate depending on
imperfective aspect because the propositions they contain are often hypothetical. It is
also highly likely the case that the negation in imperfective aspect indicates a given
action is not going to happen. Considering this we may assume that subordinate
conditional clause verbs therefore, will obviously occur in the imperfective aspect.
However, this is not the case in Mursi. In Mursi, the subordinate conditional clause
can contain the negative word ŋànì followed by a verb in subjunctive form. Like in the
imperative constructions, person cannot be marked on the subjunctive form when the
subject is second person. Person on the subjunctive form may be shown by various
forms of the verb root itself. Regarding this, Randal (1998: 248) pointed out that there
may be a possibility that historically the negative marker was a verb. This is due to the
fact that, when the main verb is negated it appears in the subjunctive form, which
usually cannot mark the main verb of the subordinate clause. At this point, it is
appropriate to mention that proclitics in Mursi can form a grammatical word while
539enclitics cannot. I hypothesise that the negative perfective particle ŋànì ‘not yet’ may
be a derived grammatical word that got its modal dependent form from the negative
marker proclitic ŋà= ― plus a copula verb *an and singular imperative suffix *i. But
this has to be proven, which I guess is a matter of time. In the meantime, the following
structural similarities have been found in negative jussive and negative interrogative
constructions using a copula verb, as in (13.10a-b).

‘Let him not become/be (!)’

NEG.IMPERV=COP.IMPERV-SG

‘Shall he not become/be?’
In Mursi, the negative word ŋànì whether imperfective or perfective, always occurs
before the main verb. Arguably, Dixon (2012: 95) puts it, ‘Cross-linguistically, there is
a strong tendency for negative particles to occur early in the clause’.
Therefore, in (13.9a-b), the negative particle ŋànì comes in the subordinate clause
following the object or immediately following conditional/temporal marker húllí and is
followed by the main clause which contains a negative imperfective main verb. Note
that, however, a perfective verb root can never be combined with the imperfective
negation proclitic ŋà=.
In addition, negation in the imperfective aspect can be used to ask rhetorical
questions in a way that also indicates the sarcastic attitude/characters that people may
show or possess.

‘Am I not a student?’
The speaker does know that he is indeed a student, so everybody knows this fact. But
he is talking as if his studentship as well as the education he got is a joke.
540The other interesting but unusual behavior of the bound imperfective negator is in the
imperative clause. Imperative clause in Mursi is formed by attaching the negator
proclitic ŋà= to an imperfective verb. The negator enclitic =ó cannot be used in the
negative imperative clause construction. The template of a negative imperative
construction is as follows:
ŋà=ROOT.IMPERV-i…..singularŋà=ROOT.IMPERV-o…..plural(13.12) a. ŋà=ɓág-í

‘You (pl.) don't eat!’
d. ŋà=čóll-ó
NEG.IMPERV=sing.IMPERV-PL
‘You (pl) don't sing!’
On the other hand, positive imperative is formed by using a perfective verb root.
Besides, singular cannot be on the verb, while plural is usually marked on the verb by
copying the vowel of the verb root. This means that there are distinct number markers
being utilized by negative and positive imperative clauses ― negative imperative -i
(singular) and -o (plural); positive imperative unmarked (singular) and -V (plural). Once
again, vowel coalescence may happen between the first person plural bound pronominal
O argument suffix -i and singular negative imperative –i, as in (13.13b-c).

A k(V)- prefix for first persons and independent personal pronouns for all other nonfirst persons may be employed in S function. Yet the morphology of this negative
lexeme is very odd and does not have consistency; it even resembles verbs which have
irregular inflectional nature. Despite its morphology, the inherently negative verb imag
behaves the same way as negated verbs; it usually takes clause-final position. When it
is being passivized, it will have a meaning ‘unknown, not known’, as in (13.34).

13.6 Indefinite-like words
Mursi lacks independent negative indefinite words in its negation constructions. Not
only in Mursi but also across world’s languages, negative indefinite words are rare (cf.
Dixon 2012: 121). However, this doesn’t mean that they don’t exist along other negator
particles. For instance, Mursi has two indefinite-like words: àhìtí ~ [àhì-ti] <thing.SGINDEF:NRSTR> ‘thing’ and hírkóna ~ [hír-kón-a] <person-one-INDEF:RSTR> ‘someone,a certain person, anybody’. When they are being used with the negative existential
lexeme níŋɛ̀, they may convey negative indefinite meanings ‘nothing’ and ‘nobody’
respectively. The negative existential níŋɛ̀ can potentially occur anywhere, but usually
in its typical clause-final position.

In (13.36b), the third person pronoun in the complement clause can be an optional
element as long as the argument is cross-referenced on the verb. Thus it doesn't cause
a difference in meaning if deleted.

The suffix -a is a restrictive/indefinite nominalizer at phrase level. Without -a hirkon means ‘twenty’

One without the negative existential word has been found ― hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j ~ <person.SG
INDEF one> ‘no one’ (Lit. a certain person). Literally, both hírkóná and hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j wouldmean ‘one/(a certain)person. However, there is one major distinction between the two,
i.e. hírkóná is a compound word indefinite pronoun derived from the indefinite generic
noun hírí ‘man’ and from indefinite pronoun kóna ‘another/certain’ (a grammaticalized
number word kón ‘one’). Whereas hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j is derived from the same generic noun hírí
plus a non-grammaticalized number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j ‘one’ (cf. Jesperson 1917). Compare
the indefinite pronoun hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j of the following examples with one hírkóná shown

The negative interjection ɪmm ɪmm ‘no’ can be used for answering a yes/no question.
But an important point that we may have to notice here is that the non-repeated form
ɪmm does not provide the intended negative meaning. Instead the ɪmm form alone is556used to answering a yes/no question positively or it would mean ~ ‘yes’, as in (13.39cd).

As can be clearly shown in (13.39a-b), ɪmm ɪmm can be used to negate a full question
sentence because oftentimes part of the question or at least the predicate will be
repeated as part of the answer. It is common and natural to get such repeated forms
from the class of interjection and being used as negators.","[576, 577, 578, 579, 580]"

In (13.13b-c), the vowels coalesce into a single high front vowel. There are other
multiple morphophonological processes that take place while forming negative
hortative clauses. The first person plural inclusive negative hortative has a template of
ŋà=k(V)-ROOT.IMPERV-Ø while first person plural exclusive negative hortative has a
template ŋà=k(V)-ROOT.IMPERV-(t/n)o.

b. ŋà=kò-hòɲ-nò
NEG.IMPERV-1.HORT-come.IMPERV:PL-1pl.EXC.SU.IMPERV
‘Let us (exc.) not come!’
The change arises with the formation of first person plural inclusive negative hortative
form when being used as indirect negative imperative. In this case, the hortative form
may convey a negative obligation meaning. The following examples demonstrate this
fact:
(13.15) a. ŋà=kì-ʃì
NEG.IMPERV=1.HORT-listen+PL.INC
‘Let us (inc.) don't listen!’ (Lit. ‘We (inc.) will not listen!’)

‘Let us (inc.) not wait!’
c. ŋà=kò-hòɲ
NEG.IMPERV=1.HORT-come.IMPERV:PL
‘Let us (inc.) not come!’
As can be shown in (13.15a-c), the hortative forms are not marked for plural number
even if all are types of imperatives, i.e. non-canonical negative imperatives. (13.15a)
has a consonant-final verb root ― ʃíg, then /g/ becomes [Ɂ], and finally it will be deleted542as it gets less audible word-finally. It appears that the more harsh the imperative is, the
shorter the forms tend to appear. Outside this, plural number marking on non-canonical
negative mild imperatives is straightforward; (i) by copying the vowel of the verb root,
or (ii) by inherently plural form of the verb. Some examples are given below:
(13.16) a. àggè
ŋà=kì-ʃìl-ì

NEG.IMPERV=1.HORT-stand-PL.INC
‘Let us (inc.) not stand!’
b. ŋà=kè-hèj-ò
NEG.IMPERV=go.IMPERV:PL-VFS
‘Let us (sg.) not go!’
Singular forms are indicated by the suffix -i, which is identical to first person singular
bound pronominal S/A argument marker.
(13.17) a. ŋà=k-èʤ-ì

‘Let me not kill!’
b. ŋà=kùùn-ì
NEG.IMPERV=1.HORT.come.IMPERV-SG
‘Let me not come!’
Note that singular and plural number marker of suffixes may come to be identical;
especially, whenever the verb root contains the high front vowel where plural number
marker is derived.
13.2.2 Perfective verb negators
Verbs that have perfective aspect can be negated by the independent perfective negator
particle ŋànì ‘not yet’ and by the negator enclitic =ó attaching to a perfective verb root.
Negated perfective verbs in first and third persons take a prefix k(V)-. This prefix is
used as person marker for first person S/A argument while as subjunctive marker for
third person. (13.18) below illustrates a 'typical' example of negation of the perfective
aspect verb and literal meaning of the negator particle ŋànì.

However, some verb roots that have the same root shapes/forms both in imperfective
and perfective aspects may also insert [t] (as in (13.19a), but not [ɗ]. Nasal ending verb
roots may epenthesize [n] in the same way as [t/ɗ]. The negative particle ŋànì always
precedes the perfective aspect verb root, and provides a full account of an action that
has not yet happened/taken place but may happen at some point of time in the future.

As it is shown in (13.20a-b), negative perfective construction in the third person
requires subjunctive mood, which is always indicated by attaching a k(V)- prefix to the
negated perfective verb root. In terms of taking a k(V)-, the subjunctive of the negative
perfective is almost identical with first person subjects, hortative-jussive, and passive
constructions.
Negative perfective verbs in the second person do not require this subjunctive prefix,
as illustrated in (13.20d-f). In addition, in (Turton et.al 2008: 81), hula was glossed as
‘when’, but not as a temporal interrogative word. It is identical with the
temporal/conditional húllí ‘when/if’, and only differs in having a geminated lateral due
to the high vowel. Above all, in (13.20f), the aspect of the main clause and the
subordinate clause is identical, which is not always the case in conditional clauses
where aspect of the main and the subordinate clauses differ sometimes. Note that
complement strategies in Mursi do not always show clear indicators of
complementizers. The absence of any such indicator (as in (13.20f) can be regarded as
one type of complementization strategy.
However, since most of the time complement clauses utilize a perfective verb in the
subjunctive mood plus an eroded verb from sé ‘say’. Reason and/or purpose clauses
545may sometimes use purpose clause marker particle ɓá ‘place, cause’ which occurs
following sé. Apart from this, in most cases both affirmative and negative complement
clauses will have similar syntactic structures plus utilize identical subjunctive verb
forms. See also the examples given below:

In (13.21a), both perfective negative particle and negated imperfective aspect are within
the main clause which have a function of denoting that the situation will likely never
happen. On the other hand, (13.21b) is a statement of fact although the verb in the
complement clause hasn't been set in subjunctive form. In the imperfective aspect, a
complement clause does not occur with the perfective aspect negator ŋànì, as in

As is shown in (1.5b), in an AOV order, due to strict orders of constituents, negated
verbs need to be moved to a clause final positions, and arguments in A/S function are
often forced to appear at clause-initial position. In (1.6a-b), the nominative case system
of Mursi operates based on an OVA/VS constituent order. Thus post-verbal subjects in
this constituent order are morphologically and formally marked by marked-nominative
case suffix -o, for a transitive post-verbal subject argument marker (A) (as in (1.6a-b)
Mursi marks both the head noun and the dependent form. There are morphological
markers for the head noun and for the dependent (modifier) called ‘restrictive and nonrestrictive modification’ form. As a head and dependent marking language, all
dependents or modifiers, except number words and quantifiers are required to indicate
their dependency relation with the head nouns they modify always by an overt
morphological inflection: -a (for restrictive) and -i [-ti] (for non-restrictive). This
dependency phenomenon between head nouns and dependents is widely known as
'Construct-Form' (CF) by some Semitists. In Semitic languages this phenomenon is also
known by a different term ― ‘construct state’. In fact, other terms are also used: ‘status
constructus’ (Tucker and Bryan 1966), ‘modified noun form’ (Reh 1996), and
‘construct form’ (Creissels 2006). In Mursi, both the head noun and the dependent can
be marked by the same dependency modification markers: HEAD.NOUN-a DEPENDENT
11(MODIFIER)-a (restrictive) or HEAD.NOUN-i [-ti] DEPENDENT (MODIFIER) (-i [-ti])
(nonrestrictive).
In Mursi, within NPs, head nouns are obligatorily marked by restrictive (as in (1.7))
and nonrestrictive (as in (1.8-1.9) forms because head nouns are required to fulfill the
role of head nouns on the basis of internal structure of NPs.

The underived adjective bú functions as an intensifier, not as a modifier. Thus the
(1.8)relationship of the head is directly with the quantifier, i.e. mɛ̀rì. However, within a
similar NP construction, if bu functions as quantifier, any other modifier following it
may not be marked by a nonrestrictive modification marker, as in (1.10).

In this grammar, as far as this marking is concerned, instead of the term constructform, I prefer to call it ‘modification marker’ (see details of it in Chapter 4).
The same noun modification markers apply in possessive constructions when
indicating possession/ownership in light of the head and/or possessed (D) and the12dependent and/or possessor (R) dependency relationship within the syntactic frame of
‘NP-internal possessive construction’. Accordingly, Mursi has five NP-internal
possessive construction types: one structure where R (the possessor) and D (the
possessed human/animate/inanimate item/object are simply juxtaposed within NP ―
and four other distinct structures where D is followed by R. A possessive relationship
that can be expressed by a juxtaposed possessor and possessed is very different from
all other possessive relationship construction types. Morphologically, both possessor
and possessed nouns do not take any markers. This means that, the possessed item is
not marked by ‘restrictive/nonrestrictive modification or ‘relator suffix -a. The same is
true for the possessor, which does not take any marker including the genitive case, for
example, híríR sáràD <man.SGname.PL> ‘The man’s name’. There is no marking oneither the possessor or the possessed. The noun sárá ‘name’ is an inherently plural noun
in Mursi and has no singular counterpart, but the meaning hasn't been affected and still
has a singular interpretation. The remaining four types of possessive constructions
within an NP involve POSSESSED(D)-a R{where the R is a POSSESSOR-GEN (as in (1.11)
or a POSSESSIVE PRONOUN (1.12) or a PERTENSIVE MARKER (1.13)).

As we can see in the examples shown above, the modification marker or the relator
suffix attached to D should always be identical. The fifth type of ‘NP-internal
possessive construction’ in Mursi is called ‘Noun modification construction’ (NMC).
It is normally the same as with the three NP construction types mentioned earlier, i.e. a
13structure where D is followed by R. Yet it stands apart from all previously mentioned
possessive construction types because it may involve a series of intermediate possessors
(Rs)/modifiers. Therefore the D and the intermediate R’s are marked by restrictive
modification marker/relator marker -a while the real possessor is marked by the
genitive case marker. The restrictive modification marker/relator marker -a is marked
on both NP constituents (the possessed/head noun and on the intermediate
possessors/modifiers) (see more in Chapter 4). Welmers (1973) used the term
‘associative construction’ in reference to nouns which express a wide range of semantic
relationships with other nouns occurring as modifiers within the same NP. See the
following examples.

How aspect is shown in Mursi has been mentioned earlier, so here I focus on mood
category. The mood category of Mursi includes imperative, hortative, jussive, reality,
and subjunctive. All are expressed by inflectional markings on the verbs. Only the
hortative and the jussive moods can be marked by an optional morphological particle
aj/aɲ. In Mursi, the imperative mood refers to a command given to an addressee (the
second person). The verb utilized in the positive imperative construction must always
occur in the perfective aspect. The negative imperative construction utilizes a verb in
the imperfective aspect. However, in both constructions number can be marked on the14verb. The plural suffix -V is marked on the verb to denote plural addressee while the
bare perfective verb root in its own indicates singular addressee. Person of the subject
is unmarked. Verb-final suffixes -a (for singular), -ɛ (for plural) and a variant of both,
-o can be added to a clause-finally occurring verbs of the imperative constructions.

Unlike the positive imperative, the negative imperative utilizes an imperfective verb
root and different number suffixes ― despite both being commands used to deliver a
speaker's intent that a certain course of action must be carried out within a specified
period of time. The negative imperative utilizes the imperfective negative proclitic ŋà=,
imperfective verb root, and two invariable number suffixes -i (for singular addressee)
and -o (for plural addressee). See the examples below.

The hortative and the jussive in Mursi are non-canonical imperative moods directed
to first and third persons and can be used to denote a mild command. Like the canonical
imperative, positive hortative and jussive moods utilize a verb in the perfective aspect
for positive whereas negative hortative and jussive moods utilize a verb in the
imperfective aspect. An interesting prosodic feature here is that a grammatical tone will
be used to distinguish between the hortative and the jussive form. The hortative mood15takes a low-toned prefix hortative k(V̀ )- and a low-toned verb root. It may optionally be
preceded by a free form high-toned hortative particle áj [áɲ] (as in (1.22).

The jussive mood refers to a command directed at the third person. The jussive mood
marker prefix k(V)- and the verb always carry a low-toned melody. Besides, the jussive
marker prefix (k(V)-) will not be marked when the negated form is used (as in (1.25c)).

Subjunctive is one of the three moods in Mursi which are expressed by the irrealis(1.25)morphological marker within the perfective aspect. Subjunctive, like the other two
irrealis moods (hortative and jussive), utilizes a prefix k(V)- and a perfective verb root.
(The details await us in Chapter 7.)
Adjectives are one of the three open word classes of Mursi. Adjectives are open
classes by derivation. Based on the morphological properties they display, Mursi
adjectives can be divided into two major categories: underived (tííní ‘small’ and bùì
‘big’) and derived (Type I― mainly from stative verbs; Type II ― derived from stative16verbs and from other word classes through productive and unproductive morphological
derivations). The two underived adjectives display sound iconicity. This phenomenon
is an association between sound and meaning. Dixon (2010:69) pointed out that a high
front vowel i is often naturally associated with a little/small object and a high back
vowel u with a big/large one. Adjectives always bear the general adjectiviser suffix -i,
regardless of each adjective's morphological property. Syntactically, adjectives can
modify the head of an NP, fill the head of an intransitive predicate slot (as in (1.26)),
fill copula complement slots, denote degree of the compared quality in comparative
constructions, and function as manner modifiers. The adjective class of Mursi covers
all semantic types that can be conveyed by adjectives.

Reduplication is the only way of marking number on underived adjectives (as in
(1.27 and 1.28)). Only the underived adjective can take degree of magnitude markers:
free form gòɗé (gèɗé) (diminutive ‘very small’) and the suffix -sís (augmentative ‘very
big’).

As Mursi is a free-constituent order language, the order among adjectives within NPs
and in sentences is relatively free. As to the ordering of adjectives within NPs,
throughout the adjective chapter and this grammar, no more than two adjectival
modifiers are available. The details of adjectives are the topic of Chapter 8.
Mursi has four valency decreasing and four valency increasing derivations. The
valency decreasing derivations are passive, antipassive, reciprocal, and reflexive.
17Benefactive, applicative/comitative, causative, and directional/motion increase the
number of core arguments. Each valency changing derivations may employ more than
one strategies, for example, the reciprocal derivation has four different possibilities
while reflexive derivation has at least two possibilities (these are topics that have been
discussed in detail in Chapter 9).
Grammatical relations in Mursi are marked by constituent order and case. However,
case-marking is often employed depending on constituent order system of the language.
Mursi is a nominative-accusative language. Although Mursi utilizes case-marking, it is
also a head-marking language that has cross-referencing bound pronominal forms to
indicate grammatical relations. As a head-marking language, it has participant reference
markings on the verb which predominantly indicate grammatical relations. This
operates by indexing bound pronominal A and O argument affixes on the verb. In
ditransitive clause constructions, argument indexing on the verb often operates
according to referential prominence scale hierarchy and verb-adjacency constraint
principles (see more on grammatical relations in Chapter 10).
Mursi has sophisticated and elaborate comparative construction techniques.
Comparative constructions explicitly indicate participants being compared and
parameter of comparison (often adjectives). Index of comparison may be indicated by
attaching a benefactive/dative marker suffix to the element of the parameter of
comparison, i.e. ‘comparative-benefactive’. Mursi has a total of seven types of
comparative constructions: mono-clausal, phrasal plus mono-clausal, bi-clausal (are of
two type TYPE I and TYPE II), connector ɓá ‘place’, hɛ́kó…tɛ̀b ‘same…as’/hɛ́tɔ́…tɛ̀b
‘be.same…as’ (‘as…as’), and one additional strategy. (Chapter 11 offers more
interesting details on comparative constructions.)18Mursi has both question types: content questions and polar questions. Content
question words (mostly pronominals) usually occupy clause final argument slots. As a
language with an AVO canonical order of constituents, all Mursi question words occur
immediately following the verb, i.e. a syntactic position available for grammatical
objects. Moreover, sentence-final positions, syntactic slots for core and non-core
arguments, may typically function as focus-bearing positions when filled by question
words. On the other hand, a polar question in Mursi can be formed either by raising
the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at end of a clause or by placing noninterrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement (see details in Chapter 12).
Typologically, negation constructions in Mursi show various striking features. In
Mursi, a number of different negation strategies may be employed to negate verbal
constituents. The strategies vary depending on grammatical systems or categories such
as aspect, mood, and person-subject. For instance, a verb in the imperfective aspect can
be negated by bound circumclitics whereas a verb in the perfective aspect is negated by
independent perfective negative particle ŋànì <NEG.PERV> ‘not, not yet, still’ plus by
negative enclitic =ó attached to the perfective verb root. Interestingly, negative
declarative clauses have an obligatory SV/AOV, constituent order, for which negated
verbs always occupy clause-final positions. This is a syntactic phenomenon that works
only for order of negated predicates in negative clauses, which is different from the
affirmative clauses in a canonical constituent order SV/AVO and from clauses having
a marked-nominative and case marked S/A subjects OVA (in a transitive clause) VS (in
an intransitive clause). Many more interesting features of the negation system are
discussed in Chapter 13.
Mursi has the following main clause types: conditional, temporal, speech report
clause, complement clause, copular clause, and obligation/deontic clause. Each clause19type may utilizes one or more varieties of clause combining/linking strategies. In Mursi,
clauses can be combined or linked by the following four major clause combining
techniques: subordination, complementization, relativisation, and coordination. For
instance, a speech report clause in Mursi is introduced by the quotative marker ké
<QUOT> ‘that’. It always precedes the speech verbs such as élí 'call' and sé 'say'; but it
may precede or follow the speech report. ké also functions as complementizer, so the
term ‘quotative-complementizer’ would best explains it.
In some circumstances, it is important to take into account that certain clause types
may follow strict subordination rules. Thus, for instance, a conditional clause
construction must contain the conditional particle hùllì ‘if, when’, which almost always
occurs at the beginning of the subordinate clause; whereas a constituent that occurs at
the subordinate clause-final position is being marked by the subordinate clause marker
enclitic =jè [=è] (as in (1.29)).

"13.8 Tracing and linking negators
While different types of negators constitute the negation system of the language, it is
yet possible to trace the origin of the form which recurs in some of the negative
particles. Some of the negator forms are attested in a number of Surmic group languages
while few forms were also attested outside the group. In view of Mursi negators, there557is relatively compelling evidence in the negator proclitic ŋà= which in one way or
another is the origin for the rise of the following independent negative forms:
(i)/ŋàánó/ ~ [ŋà=Ɂán=ó] (see §13.9). The same morphological process, cliticization,
should have applied to Chai verbs because Chai has almost identical
morphological verbal negation process to Mursi. However, Last and Lucassen
(1998) didn't adequately describing the exact morphological process that has to
be employed in the negation system of the Southeasten Surmic languages. Due to
this, in their grammatical sketch of Chai language, the negator enclitic =ó has
been presented as being a final suffix -o.(ii)/ŋànì/ may well be reconstructed from the negator proclitic ŋà= and the
imperfective copula verb an <COP.IMPERV>. The morpheme i which occurs
following the copula could possibly be a singular number marker ― ~ [ŋà=án-i].
The existence of i possibly as a sole singular number marker suggests that the
particle has no self-standing form and cannot be inflected for further grammatical
categories including for plural number.(iii) The negative existential-locative imperfective verb /níŋɛ̀/ has the same forms for
third person singular and plural. It perhaps developed from the locative suffix ni
added to the negator proclitic ŋà= and the singular positive existential verb /íh/
<exist.SG.IMPERV> which always has [i] realization due to recurrent deletion of
glottal fricative /h/ word-finally ― /h/ ~ Ø.
Finally we will get a form níŋai [ni-ŋà=i] <LOC-NEG=exist.IMPERV:SG> which I
believe developed into a fully fledged verb form níŋɛ̀ ― ‘x’ at/in is not
present/exist’ or ‘x’ not at/in ‘y’ or ‘x’ without ‘y’. But what we cannot be certain
of is that it can inflect for person like any other regular verb. Contrary to the
claim made above, this suggest that níŋ could be a root form rather than a derived558form from different grammatical categories. An in-depth study is required in
order to identify its actual form. Last and Lucassen (1998: 420) claimed that níŋɛ̀
would perhaps be a negative copula. It is a hypothesis that makes sense until
disproved by new evidence.
(iv) The contrastive clause marker particle ŋànìjè looks like a derived form because
the form in itself gives a hint it may be from ŋànì and from the subordinate marker
enclitic =jè. Also, in most cases, the element that follows this contrastive
marker is the main clause.
Therefore, in all negator forms listed above, there is one constant form recurring, i.e.
/ŋa/ ~ [*ŋa/*ŋà=/*ŋ/. In fact negators have not been given proper place and attention
by some Surmic language investigators. Due to this, a number of inconsistent and
incoherent negator markers have been reported in different literatures.
For instance, the Mursi main negators ŋà= and =ó undoubtedly have clitic status while
in Chai (another Southeastern Surmic group language), ŋa has been reported as an
independent particle (Last and Lucassen 1998: 418). Last and Lucassen also reported
another independent negative particle ŋásò. However, such form has not been found in
my corpus so far, despite it being an acceptable morphological form in Mursi. If any
such form exist in Mursi, it is undoubtedly reconstructed from two clitics ― the negator
proclitic ŋà= and from floating emphatic enclitic =so.","[580, 581, 582]"

12.4 Tag questions
Tag questions may carry the expectation of confirmation (cf. Dixon 2012: 396). Tag
questions in Mursi are formed by initial declarative clause (the anchor) followed by
adjoined interrogative clause (the tag). Tag questions are normally different from polar
questions in that the tag clause is absent in polar questions. Moreover, the truth value528of the propositions that the answers of polar questions may contain can be fully stated.
It doesn’t matter whether the answers are positive or negative.

The operator verb in both declarative and in the tag clause is a copula verb in

and the raised intonation onto the entire tag clause are main operators which help to
achieve the question.","[550, 551, 552]"

Negative forms utilize imperfective verb roots and at the same time do not take the

348In (7.69a), the suppletive verb root indicates plural while the motion suffix -áná in
(7.69b) occurs only as the third person singular and first person plural inclusive
indicator. Negated verbs always take the sentence-final position, thus the postposition
word is now preceding the predicate, as can be seen in (7.69b).
To sum up, the second person singular form of the canonical imperative is one of the
shortest formally marked forms in the language ― rɛ (wait.PERV:IMP) ‘wait (sg.)!’ and
the second person plural form of the canonical imperative is the shortest of all
morphologically marked forms. The perfective verb root alone can denote an abrupt
command directed to second person addressee. All inflectional morphology of the
canonical and non-canonical (hortative/jussive) imperative can be exhaustively marked
on the positive as well as on the negative imperative verb from slot 1, 2, 7, and 14.
Moreover, both canonical and non-canonical imperatives can be negated in the same
way as declaratives but indeed imperatives differ in one way, that is, imperatives can
be negated just by the proclitic marker ŋà=. Regarding the marking of negation on
imperatives and declaratives, a comparative summary is given in Table 7.34 below.

Subjunctive is one of the three moods in Mursi which are expressed by the irrealis

irrealis moods (hortative and jussive), utilizes a prefix k(V)- and a perfective verb root.","[370, 371, 372]"

As it is shown in (13.1 and 13.2), the negators (circumclitics) occur on both sides of the
(13.2)verbal predicate, which is a clause final constituent. The negative clitics in Mursi attach
only to the verb, and certainly do not attach to other constituents other than the verb.
For negated predicate, aspect can be shown in multiple ways ― by the negator proclitic,
by verb root, and by bound pronominal S/A argument suffixes.

‘S/he doesn’t want’
As elaborated in (13.3-c), Mursi may arguably employ an obligatory double negation
in the imperfective aspect, where two negator clitics simultaneously code
predicate/clausal negation. If a bound pronominal for the S/A argument is marked by
536zero morpheme, a few verb roots that end in the alveolar nasal [n] may undergo a
compensatory lengthening process, as in (13.3c). In (13.3c), ŋàhínómay be realizedas [ŋahinno] in surface form. When the S/A argument is first person plural inclusive,
eventually there will be a tendency for a sequence of vowels to co-occur, as in (13.4).
In this case, t is epenthesised to avoid sequence of vowels as well as to mark plural
number.

‘We (inc.) will not kill the pig.’
When the verb acquires identical root form in both imperfective and perfective aspect,
(13.4) a.the negator proclitic becomes the sole grammatical morpheme which shows aspect of
the verb. The first person plural exclusive bound pronominal S/A suffix -o often
fuses/coalesces with the negative enclitic =ó as in (13.4b).
b. ŋà=kó-jóg=ó
NEG.IMPERV=1SU-speak=1pl.INC.SU.IMPERV.NEG
‘We (exc.) will not speak; we (exc.) don’t speak.’
Underlyingly, (13.4b) will be realized as <ŋà=kó-jóg-o=ó>. Despite these rare and
specific morphophonemic changes, in other forms of the negation of declarative
clauses, the interaction of verbs and negator clitics show consistency regardless of the
form of verb roots. Examples strengthening this fact are given below.

Thus, all, vowel-final verb root (13.5a), vowel-initial verb root (13.5b), and derivational
morphemw suffixed verb (13.5c) operate freely without morphophonemic processes.
537The obligatory double negation system that is used for the imperfective aspect can be
transformed into an optional triple negation system. The optional triple negation system
can be achieved by combining the imperfective verb root with the preverbal perfective
negation word ŋànì. Thus, the optional preverbial negative word ŋànì together with the
negator circumclitics on imperfective verbs forms the triple negation system.

Therefore, both examples, the optional preverbial perfective negative word ŋànì has a
meaning of ‘still’. ŋànì also has a 'persistive marker' function in other grammatical
constructions. The occurrence of the perfective negative ŋànì and the imperfective

13.3 Negating a copula clause
Mursi copula verbs can be negated in the same way as regular verbs. Thus copula
clauses are also negated in the same way as verbal clauses. In copula clauses, the
copula complement indicates either identity or attribution, as in (13.27a-c).

Since all negated constituents in Mursi take clause final positions, copula complements
in negative copula clauses will move to clause second position and thus take the549syntactic slots next to the copula subjects. The third person copula verb form has the
invariable form a.
It has two negative varieties: (i) ŋaano ([ŋaɁano] ~ <ŋà=án=ó>) (13.27a) which
indicates that it has been a consonant-final root at an early stage of the language, and
(ii) ŋajo ([ŋajo] ~ <ŋà=á=ó>) which shows it is indeed an uninflected form of a.

the instance in which the tag forms occur with independent pronouns can be
substantiated by the fact that the sentences (but not the tags) involve non-copula verbs.

With regard to scope, it is worth mentioning the distinction between the negative clitics
and negative copula forms in sentences. The negator clitics ŋà= and =ó have scope
over the predicate of a clause while the negative copula forms in Table 13.3 above have
sentential/clausal scopes. The third person negative copula form ŋàánó {ŋàɁánó or ŋàjó
~ [ŋà=á=ó]} can negate almost any sentence/clause and therefore has a scope that
extends beyond negating a single constituent of a sentence/clause. So ŋàánó/ŋàjó can
be called sentential/clausal negator.
13.4 Negative existential verb níŋɛ ‘not present’
The negative verbal lexeme níŋɛ ‘not present, without’ is used to negate existential or
locational clauses. níŋɛ̀ is an impersonal form that functions as a general negator of
existential or locational clauses regardless of person or number of the subject.

It can inflect for person of the S argument but in a rather unique way. Only bound
pronominal O argument markers can be marked on it. The alveolar nasal n is inserted
between the root-like form of the negative existential verb and participants that occur
as direct objects.

imperfective and the perfective aspects are almost identical in a number of ways. There
are however two exceptional differences, ― (i) the forms in the third person display552inflected and uninflected forms, and (ii) those in Table 13.4 take verb-final suffixes
because they are intransitive verbs in the imperfective aspect whereas those in Table
13.5 take portmanteau suffixes. At a first glance, these portmanteau suffixes look like
those that are copied from the vowel of the verb root, for instance, the suffix -i. But
they are not applicable to all and do not show any consistency throughout the paradigm.
Therefore, regarding the nature of these portmanteau suffixes, further study is
needed. Note that the negative existential verb níŋɛ̀ has a positive counterpart which
exhibits inherently singular and plural forms in its roots. Most importantly, this negative
existential verb does occur anywhere in the clause where it is deemed necessary. Some
examples are given below:

"3297.3.1.3 Mood
The mood category of Mursi includes imperative (7.3.1.3.1), hortative (7.3.1.3.2),
jussive (7.3.1.3.3), reality status (7.3.1.3.4), and subjunctive (7.3.1.3). All are expressed
by inflectional markings on the verbs. Only the hortative-jussive mood can be marked
by an optional free morphological particle aj/aɲ. All utilize affixes with the exception
of the negative imperative that utilizes the negative proclitic. All mood constructions
utilize the perfective aspect verb roots.
7.3.1.3.1 Imperative
As Aikhenvald (2010: 2) puts it, ‘imperative mood is the commonest way of expressing
commands in the languages of the world’. In Mursi, the imperative mood refers to a
command given to an addressee (the second person). The verb utilized in the positive
imperative construction must always occur in the perfective aspect. The negative
imperative construction utilizes a verb in the imperfective aspect. However, in both
constructions number can be marked on the verb. The plural suffix -V is marked on the
verb to denote plural addressee while the bare perfective verb root on its own indicates
singular addressee. Person of the subject is unmarked (always second person). Verbfinal suffixes -a (for singular), -ɛ (for plural) and variants of both -o can be added to a
clause-finally occurring verbs of the imperative constructions.
In an instance when there is difficulty in making a distinction between imperfective
and perfective aspects of the verb roots, one form of the root may be taken and can be
glossed as perfective.
Table 7.30 below presents the template of imperative on mood in Mursi and the verb
forms and inflections utilized in the positive and negative imperative constructions.","[352, 353]"

‘Kill yourself!’ (Lit. ‘Die yourself!’)A non-canonical imperative form can also be used for persons other than the
addressee (Aikhenvald 2010: 47). Mursi utilizes a non-canonical imperative
constructions by a morphological marking on the verb. The hortative prefix k(V)(where V́ carries a High tone) for first person and the jussive prefix k(V)- (where V̀
carries a Low tone) for third person are used to carry out commands other than to the
addressee. However, the real non-command forms of the hortative and jussive
constructions make use of the free form particle aj/aɲ in addition to the k(V)- form
prefixes.

have optional free subject pronouns that occur preceding the whole structure of both
mood forms. This is however not possible in command forms ― maybe in a very rare
case for first person singular, where the first person pronoun may follow the
imperative-hortative structure, as in (7.43a).

In fact, in Mursi, the second person singular imperative form shows a similarity in
prefix with the first person plural inclusive hortative form49. The motion suffix -a
indicates the direction of the action of the addressee whether buying or selling, in the
otherwise unidentifiable verb tal ‘buy, sell’. This motion suffix can only be used in the
perfective aspect.
Like the various number and verb-final marking suffixes which are only used in the
imperatives, the benefactive suffix -ɛsɛ also functions only for positive imperative.
Declarative and other types of sentences utilize the other variety of this suffix, i.e. ɛ̀sɛ̀n.

put.PERV-BEN:IMP sheep enclosure in-OBL
‘Keep the ram in the enclosure!’The interaction of imperative and aspect resides in the distinction between positive and
negative imperatives. This is due to the nature of negative imperatives which require
an action to be acted upon immediately at the time the speaker commands, what to do
right at that moment. The reality status which the positive imperative (realis) and the
negative imperative (irrealis) is also related to the speaker’s intention and rationality,
― whether a command is to be carried out, will be performed immediately, or shall be
delayed seems to be a key point to be taken into account. Thus from a reality moodburtɔ ‘many days ago, more than 2-3 days ago’ is a time word which also functions as demonstrative
manner adverb, i.e. <past mentioned; referential demonstrative>.
49
Furthermore, first and second person singular subjunctive forms tend to be identical, for example,
kaiɲo ‘I may giving’ kaiɲo ‘You (sg.) may giving’.
48336point of view, negative imperative expresses the speaker’s intention that the action not
be carried out immediately.
Unlike the positive imperative, the negative imperative utilizes an imperfective verb
root and different number suffixes ― despite both being commands used to deliver a
speaker's intent that a certain course of action must be carried out within a specified
period of time. The negative imperative utilizes the imperfective negative proclitic ŋà=,
imperfective verb root, and two invariable number suffixes -i (for singular addressee)
and -o (for plural addressee). See the examples below ― singular addressee (7.45a-c)
and plural addressee (7.46a-c).

"341But if a hortative/jussive mood is used to give a command and request at the same time,
that requires a hortative/jussive answer, a copula comes at the beginning of a sentence.
Just for the purpose of Mursi grammar, I labeled the function of this copula as
‘anticipatory request-reply’ marker, as in (7.56).

Finally, there are still a few verbs that do not distinguish between singular and plural

indicate number.

Commands can be directed at first person (‘me’, ‘us’) and third person (‘him’, ‘her’,
(7.57)‘them’) (Aikhenvald 2010: 47). Commands directed at first person are known as
hortative §7.3.1.3.2, while those that are directed at third person are known as jussive
§7.3.1.3.3. In Mursi, both constitute the irrealis mood.
7.3.1.3.2 Hortative
The hortative in Mursi is a non-canonical imperative mood directed towards first person
and can be used to denote a mild command. As seen on Table 7.31, hortative is part of
the irrealis mood and only utilizes a perfective verb root. This is due to the fact that the
irrealis in general signals some degree of completeness while on the other hand the
basic assumption of the imperfective aspect signals incompleteness. The hortative form
takes a low-toned prefix k(V̀ )- and is optionally preceded by a free form high-tonedhólóʔ ‘music’ refers to song and dance (cultural form of singing and dancing) and it is a noun, while
čólló ‘sing’ only refers the action of singing and dancing (it is a verb).
53342hortative particle aj [aɲ]. As in many verbal inflectional prefixes of Mursi, the vowel
of the prefix k(V̀ )- is copied from a consonant-initial perfective verb root's vowel. The
hortative template is illustrated below.

epenthesised -t. Verb-final suffixes -a, -o and -ɛ can be suffixed to a perfective verb
root (for first person) and after inclusive/exclusive markers (for both first person plural).
The verb-final suffix -ɛ is often suffixed to plural forms.

Negation on hortative is marked in the same way as on the canonical imperative forms.
The difference is that the verb turns into imperfective aspect when negated, as can be
shown by the negative hortative template below.

As it is illustrated in (7.60a-c) above, the particle aj/aɲ has no function in the negative
hortative construction. Thus, it is excluded from all types of non-canonical negative
imperative constructions. The distinction between the two hortative particles aj and aɲ
is not clear at this stage (also occurring with jussive forms) but both forms seem to be
associated with the idiolect and stylistic preference of speakers.

However, there is viable evidence that both hortative and jussive forms which take
aj/aɲ particles tend be used for polite requests other than orders or commands. Besides,
in a rare instances, a verb tends be uninflected for person in a hortative form but can be
344inflected for person when it is in a jussive form. When such instances occur, the person
can be shown by a personal pronoun function as in O function or an associative word
kàrì ‘together, with’ may be used. Compare the following hortative forms (7.62a-b) and
jussive forms in (7.62c-d).

The first person plural hortative form in (7.62b) does not distinguish between inclusive
and exclusive. As we have seen in (7.51), imperative use of a morphologically deficient
verb or of a verb whose semantic origin is a non-verbal, tend to behave differently when
used in imperatives. The reduplicated kɔ́bkɔ́b ‘quick’ is a derived adverb from the verb
root kɔb ‘to follow’, has a secondary function as a verb ‘hurry’. It doesn’t take any
verbal inflection in its reduplicated form. Neither indicates aspect or number. As shown
below in (7.63b-c), the first person singular and plural hortative forms are
indistinguishable.

person subjunctive forms, ― because second person subjective verb forms tend to

7.3.1.3.3 Jussive
The jussive mood refers to a command directed at the third person. Jussive and
hortative moods of Mursi are similar in many ways except for the following
properties of the jussive:
(i)the jussive mood marker prefix k(V)- always carries a low-toned melody,(ii)the jussive marker prefix (k(V)-) will not be marked when the negated form
is used,(iii)number will not be marked on the singular form of the jussive mood while
number can be shown on the singular of the negative jussive form, and(iv)the singular of the negative jussive form may take the verb-final suffix of
the non-imperative moods, i.e. -ɔ̀, whereas the plural of the negative jussive
form takes the common verb-final suffix of the non-canonical imperative
forms, i.e. -ɛ.","[364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370]"
"13.1Bound negatorsBound negators in Mursi are circumclitics in which the imperfective verb root is nested
within the ŋà=VERB.ROOT=ó circumclitic negation marker. They are realized as the
proclitic ŋà= (on verbs in imperfective aspect) and as the enclitic =ó (on verbs in the
imperfective and perfective aspect). Thus all bound negators are discussed in separate
subsections below ― circumclitics as negators of verbs of the imperfective aspect
§13.2.1 and an enclitic negator of verbs in the perfective aspect §13.2.2.
13.2.1 Imperfective verb negators
Verbs in the imperfective aspect can be negated by using two negator clitics ŋà= and
=ó. Due to the fact that they are applied to a single constituent simultaneously on the
verb, they can be called double negation (markers). For the interpretation of the proclitic
ŋà= two paths were followed depending on the aspect of the verb being utilized: (i)
negative imperfective <NEG.IMPERV=> when procliticized to the host (an imperfective
verb), and (ii) negative perfective or just negative when procliticized to a perfective
imperative verb form host. The latter has been elaborated on in the section dealing with
interaction of negation and imperative.",[558]
"2.8 Clitics
Clitics are morphological elements which do not have the full set of properties of an
independent (phonological) word, and may form a phonological unit with the word that
precedes it or follows it (Matthews 1997: 56 cited in Aikhenvald (2003: 42). Above all,
Aikhenvald (ff.42) points out, ‘clitics are prosaically deficient or unusual in certain
ways’. Mursi has seven clitics and each has its own syllable (including C ‘consonant’)
and morphosyntactic function: demonstrative, definite, negative, number, subordinate,
emphatic, and discourse particle. Of the seven morphosyntactic functions,
demonstrative and negation are shown by circumclitics. In Mursi, circumclitics
(proclitics combined with enclitics) can form independent phonological words. This
means, both the demonstrative and negation circumclitics can form independent
phonological words having the same semantic category as the one they form when
attached to their hosts (see example 2.88). Table 2.10 below illustrates syllabic shapes
of Mursi clitics.",[135]
"616ashamed’ is an idiomatic verb ― literally meaning ‘to eat (feel) shame/shy’. The above
example is not the only instance where this contrastive coordinative marker
semantically behaves like as cause-result (adversative) linker, but it often denotes the
same semantics especially when it is placed at clause initial position.

stage is that the contrastive coordinative marker ŋànìjè may no longer have an
adversative function when being used at the left most periphery of a given discourse
but rather functions as a coordinative particle (see the example given below).

Disjunctive clauses can be indicated by various ways but primarily by disjunctive
coordination (conjunction) markers wo [óó] ‘or’and rarely by kóó ‘or’. Both disjunction
markers can also be combined with other epistemic modality marking particles such as

In (14.104a), the copula subject stands for both copula complements conjoined by the
disjunctive marker. As can be seen in (14.105b), normally it is possible to convey the
same meaning without the disjunctive marker, i.e. by adding a copula verb to second
copular clause. It logically makes sense since the propositions in both do not normally
hold true or false ― as they are question types that seek confirmation and whose answer
can be either a ‘yes-no’ type or repeat the whole clause, or just repeat the subjectless
copular clause form (á čàllì/á gɛ̀rsì).
As listed in Table 14.3, the primary disjunctive marker óó and that of kóó can be
combined with the dubitative marker ka to indicate clauses coordinated in alternative
conjunction ways. The dubitative marker is always a peripheral constituent, ― it may
either occupy the position available before a clause or appear at the right edge of a
619clause (see also Chapter 12, §12.3). Their combination enables us to form a nonequestion type alternative conjunction construction between two clauses and NPs, i.e.
either…or type coordination. This type of coordination is often called correlative
coordination. On the basis of the current observation, the following templates have been
proposed:
i.[káCLAUSE1ii.","[639, 640, 641, 642, 643]"

Purpose clauses which are introduced by commutative/applicative marking devices,
may depend on other higher level discourse organization to clarify their meaning.
Broadly speaking, the semantics of the above clauses may seem largely determined by
the context in which they are being used. In addition to the above expressions, purpose
clause can also be shown without any subordination or linking particle at all but by
using the imperfective aspect form of the desiderative verb hin ‘want’. hin expresses
desire or intent of speaker and often has identical aspect with the verb of the main clause
(as in (14.29a).

‘I went to the river in order to wash my clothes.’
(Lit. ‘Wanting to wash clothes, I went to wash clothes; or I want to wash
clothes so I went to wash clothes.
In the example shown above, the first clause is a positive purpose clause, which also
functions as complement of the main clause even if the main clause itself has another
complementizer, i.e. kúčúrí (‘to wash’). The fact that kúčúrí along with rúmíɲá forms
a nominalized possessive phrase O (‘my washing of clothes’). Note that 'to wash cloth'
and 'wash one's own body' are separate verbs in Mursi, the latter oɲ is more often used
579in intransitive sense. The other complementizer is the motion towards (ventive) suffix
-áná (a full form, i.e. the form attached to an imperfective verb in the third person
singular root form). When used in non-main clauses, hín may often seems to have the
nature of nonfinite verbs (an uninflected form). It, however, as seen above is a fully
inflected verb containing person and number markers for the sake of showing samesubject clauses.
The auxiliary sé ‘say’ in (14.30) occurs in uninflected form and cannot be marked for
person but just be used as a complementizer of the negative purpose clause (intention)
‘in order not to forget’.

14.2.2.5 Concessive clauses
A concessive clause is a clause which makes a concession, against which the
proposition in the main clause is contrasted (Thompson 2007: 262). Concessive clauses
in Mursi can be shown by concessive clause subordinators: ŋànìjè ‘however, but’, ŋànì
‘not (yet)’, and kó húllí ‘even though, even if (Lit. ‘and if’).

(Lit. ‘If it becomes the case that I do, I would like; however, there is no long
time.’)
In most cases, the verb of the subordinate and the main clause occur in subjunctive
mood. The verb daʃi has an invariable verb root form in both aspects. But subjunctive
mood normally applies only to verbs that are in the perfective aspects. Thus, as can be
seen from the example above, the verbs in both clauses are in perfective aspect, in an
580ideal state to attach subjunctive/irrealis markers. Semantically, (14.31) is also more of
a conditional-like concessive clause.

"56014.2.1 Conditional clause
A conditional clause mainly presents hypothetical proposition which may or may not
happen in the main clause (apodosis) depending on the condition in the subordinate
clause (protasis). The subordinate clause of a Mursi conditional construction must
contain the conditional particle húllí ‘if, when’, which almost always occurs at the
beginning of the subordinate clause. The following template shows the actual syntactic
structure of the subordinate clause of the conditional construction:
if (CONDITIONAL)
…….‘X’=jè/=èhúllíSUBORD:CLwhen (TEMPORAL)
Accordingly, ‘X’ represents any constituent that appears at the end of a
dependent/subordinate clause. Therefore a constituent that occurs at the subordinate
clause-final position is marked by the subordinate clause marker enclitic =jè (following
vowel-final) and =è (following consonant-final constituent).

‘If I go to Addis Ababa, I will study Amharic.’Note that in Mursi, an allomorph of the oblique case marker suffix =jè and the

undergo fusion. I would say it is highly likely that the fusion process is occuring. In
most cases, both the subordinate and the main clauses will have the same aspect, as in
(14.2). This does not mean necessarily that is always the case. The verb of the561subordinate clause may be in perfective aspect and an imperfective aspect verb may
predicate the main clause, as in (14.3a).

1sgIn fact, the change in aspect of the verb in the subordinate clause will have an effect on
the semantics, which is different from the formal semantics of a subordinate conditional
clause. The subordinate clause in (14.3a) may be expressed in an equivalent but less
formal way ― ‘as long as’. So it may also mean ‘As long as he is gone, I shall stay
here’. The subordinate verbs of conditional clauses usually utilize perfective aspect.
Even the copula predicate has to occur in perfective aspect when used in the subordinate
clause in the stative intransitive sense ‘be good’, as in (14.3b).

"2796.8 Additional suffixes
Grammatical number can be shown by various suffixes on verbs and adjectives. In the
imperative construction, only plural number is shown on perfective verb roots.
Person/subject cannot be marked on the imperative forms. Number of addressee can be
marked on the verb by a vowel suffix -V (vowel-copying) which is usually identical
with the vowel of the verb root.

However, there is a difference between positive and negative imperative constructions.
In the negative imperative construction, singular addressee can also be marked on the
verb root but in the imperfective aspect. Unlike in the positive imperatives, vowel
copying is not applicable in the negative imperative constructions. The suffix -i marks
singular addressee whereas -o marks plural addressee, as in (6.70a-d).

slightly different number-marking suffixes. Two derived adjectives of dimension and
two adjectives of colour take an overt plural number marking. These four adjectives
take the plural suffix -a. This is a plural suffix usually marked on nouns that belong to
CATEGORY III in the marked plural system. What is unusual about this plural suffix isthat it has allomorphs [-ta] and [-na].

6.9 Number-determined suppletive verb forms
Including Africa, number-determined suppletive forms of verbs are found in a wide
range of languages (Dixon 2012: 63). Baale (a Southwest Surmic language) has similar
verb root alternation system to indicate number on verbs (Yigezu and Dimmendaal,
1998: 302). In Mursi, a few verb roots can undergo suppletions three to four times.
Number-determined suppletive verb forms usually operate in accordance with the
aspectual system of the language. Five verbs with number-determined suppletive forms
have been found ― four intransitive verbs (one verb of existence, one verb of posture
and two verbs of motion) and a ditransitive verb ‘give’.

A common similarity of these question words is that they all occur sentence-finally.
They can question core and non-core arguments. In referring to non-human participants,
both ɔ̀ŋ ‘what.OBJ’ and ɔ́nɔ́ŋ ‘what.NOM’ also share certain syntactic properties, for
instance, both occur in O function and can be copula complements immediately
following regular or copula verbs. The question word ɔ̀ŋ normally refers to non-human
object participants while ɔ́nɔ́ŋ refers to non-human subject participants.

In both (12.1a-b), ɔ̀ŋ is in O function following the transitive predicates. In (12.1b),
since the interrogative word has taken over the sentence-final position, the oblique
argument is put in sentence-initial position. In addition, the verb root tál ‘buy, sell’ does
not distinguish between imperfective and perfective aspects. So, the second person
bound pronominal suffix -o performs the temporal duty of the verb. Following a copula
verb, the interrogative ɔ̀ŋ can fill a copula complement slot as predicate nominal, as in
(12.2). Since post-verbal position is associated with focus, and content questions
typically also have similarities with focus constructions.

research. On the other hand, ɔ́nɔ̀ŋɔ́ ‘with.what’ as pointed out above is a question word
that may be used to ask about an instrument used. The instrument function is indicated
in two ways: (i) by an oblique case marker suffix -ɔ, which is added to the form ɔ́nɔ̀ŋ
and yelds the instrumental form ɔ́nɔ́ŋ-ɔ́, and (ii) by a multifunctional free from particle
kó (has an instrumental or a comitative linker function in the examples below).

instrument/the means by which the cause happened, thus kó has a secondary function.

The question word ɛ̀nɛ̀ŋ ‘how?’ is used to question the method in which an action is
carried out. In addition, it may be used for asking about the name of a person or location;
and occasionally to refer to the amount (quantity) of referents.

Depending on the discourse context in which they occur, both expressions are
ORc. wàappropriate even if (12.9c) is more appropriate than (12.9b), because it is expressed by
a predicate rather than by deverbal noun/NP. (12.9b) explicitly shows person and
number of human participant of the discourse who is being questioned. Thus, obviously
the second person singular is the addressee questioned. One can also ask for the name
of a person or location, as is shown below (as in (12.10a-b)).

reason why a certain incredible situation happened. kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ has stylistic dominance over
tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ ‘why?’, which is the only sentence-initial interrogative word. See example 12.13
below (repeated from 7.24).

‘‘‘Hih!’’ why did you (sg.) eat a crocodile? Also you (sg.) ate a monitor lizard,

As the form points out, kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ is composed of purpose-like preposition particle kɛ and
the formative ɔ̀ŋ ‘what’, the combination of the two obviously did produce a meaning:
‘for what’. For instance in (12.14), the question sentence seeks an answer for the reason
why the human participant stayed long. However, (12.14) can also be used to question
by which method the participant being questioned used to stay.

An interesting scenario is found in (12.15) where kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ is used with tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in the same
interrogative sentence.

‘Why did he bring an accusation against him?’
The fact is that both occur in their designated syntactic slots. The enquiry here should
be regarding the function of each reason interrogative words. tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ always occurs
before a verb sentence-initially and has a semantic scope over the entire sentence. So
tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in (12.15) has the function of questioning the whole motive of the sentence in a
single explanation. On the other hand, since kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ is a bimorphemic form with one of
its component being ɔ̀ŋ ‘what’, it makes sense for its meaning to express inquiry of the
515purpose 'for what'. As Aikhenvald (2015: 278) states, ‘interrogatives in many languages
do not form one word class in terms of their morphological categories and syntactic
functions’. Mursi adheres to this assertion, for the reason that membership of
interrogative words to one particular word class seems always to be problematic as they
are made up of more than one component. Besides, interrogative words such as kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ
and tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ can belong separate syntactic categories despite sharing the same semantics.
The fact is that this view does not include the interrogative pronouns of the language.
Of the syntactic deviation of tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ from the other question word members, not much is
known at this stage. However, a piece of information has been stated from (Dixon 2012,
Li and Thompson 1981) may indicate the syntactic nature of tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in relation to other
languages. A good example is Mandarin Chinese where a single question word can
mean ‘how’ and ‘why’. In Mandarin, ‘why’ is a sentential adverbial requesting the
respondent to provide a semantic frame for the entire sentence’ (Dixon 2012: 414). In
addition, it can be moved to the beginning of the sentence if the interpretation intended
to be delived is ‘why’.
In light of this, tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ in Mursi behaves the same way as in Mandarin. The real
semantics of ‘why’ can only be delivered by tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ and certainly not by kɛ̀ ɔ̀ŋ. The verb,
mostly, occurs in the irrealis mood. As can be shown in the following sentences, the
interrogative word tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ is fronted for emphasis, when it enquires about the reason why
certain actions took place and expressing a strong rebuke.

In addition, as shown in all of (12.16a-c), sentence-final NPs are marked by a definite
marker enclitic =ŋà. Note that definiteness in Mursi is phrasal-marked at the end NPs
or on constituents that occur at the end of a sentence. tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ can rarely occur sentencefinally, but only in special circumstances, as in (12.17).

When there is a topic or a pre-posed thematically prominent participant marker at the
beginning of a sentence, tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ becomes a sentence second constituent (as in (12.18).

12.2.4 òrì ‘where’ and ɓónnój ‘where’
The interrogative words òrì ‘and ɓónnój have one meaning ‘where’. Both are used to
ask questions eliciting answers which would fill the local adverbial slots of a clause.
No locative or oblique case marker is possible to attach to these two location question
forms. The choice of the local interrogative word may depend on the point of reference
of a known location within the speaker’s view, or a location which is not known by the
speaker. The examples given below illustrate this further: òrì (12.20a-c) and ɓónnój

Syntactically, Mursi adverbs may split between sentence-initial and sentence-final
positions. Most manner adverbs occur sentence-finally, even if few of them can occur
at initial positions. The same syntax applies to locative adverbs. Nevertheless, the
clause-final slots occupied by the local interrogative words òrì ‘and ɓónnój in the
examples illustrated above are slots which could be filled by demonstrative formative
type locative adverbs.","[533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542]"
"5.7 Predicative possessive construction
A possessive relationship can be established within a clause, in the form of predicative
possession (Aikhenvald 2013: 27). Predicative possessive construction in Mursi can be
expressed by the verb lɔ̀m ‘have/hold/grab’ (§5.7.1), existential verb íh ‘exist’(§5.7.2),
and an invariable copula verb á <COP.3.IMPERV> (for both singular/plural) (§5.7.3).
5.7.1 With the verb lɔ̀m ‘have’
The verb lɔ̀m ‘have’ is a transitive verb, has no perfective form and can never be used
in command and passive constructions. A possessive construction produced with the
help of this verb may be translated as in English ― RA have/hold/grasp DO (cf. Dixon2422010: 299) (where subject of the transitive verb lɔ̀m (A) is the same as the possessor
(R); and the object (O) is the same as the possessed (D)). The possessed noun can be
any simple or derived noun or any possessable object in O slot.

In (5.44), the adjective čàllì ‘good’ (whose origin is a stative verb) is nominalized by
nouns of state marker suffix -in; thus it is a noun.
5.7.2 With the existential verb ih ‘exist/present’
The verb of existence has four different roots, each of which comes carrying a
grammatical information such as person and aspect. What makes the existential verb
different from the verb ‘have’ is that the verb ‘exist’ is an intransitive verb used with D
in S function, and then the R becomes a peripheral NP often marked by the
preposition/comitative particle kó ‘with’ or oblique case marker -ɔ/-je attached to D. A
positive existential possessive predication will have the following schema: D exists
with R or D exists for R, as in (5.46-5.49).

These existential possessive predication constructions shown above can be expressed
by the negative counterpart níŋɛ̀ ‘there is not; not present/exist’. The negative
existential possessive construction is used to express the absence of the D. In Mursi,
all negated verbs including the negative existential verb always occur at clause-final
positions. This generates another existential predicative possessive schema: R-D
NEGATIVE.EXISTANCIAL. Some examples are provided as follows:(5.51) [àɲè]R

5.7.3 Using a copula verb
Possessive relationships can be expressed with a copular construction (Dixon 2010:
302; Aikhenvald 2013: 29). The copula verb in Mursi inflects for person and number,
and alters its root form for aspect. However, a possessive relationship through a copula
construction can only be shown by one specific copula verb form, i.e. the third person
imperfective form á <COP.3SG/PL.IMPERV>. Accordingly, a possessive relationship
construction using this copula verb may yield the schema: D (copula subject) COPULA
VERB R (copula complement).","[265, 266, 267, 268]"

The suffix -ni is a discourse resolution marker but it does not function as an
independent particle. This discourse resolution marker suffix is also found in the
Tirmaga language and has two functions (Bryant 1993: 41). The two functions of -ni in
a narration are: (i) it indicates the resolution of a dilemma or goal, and (ii) it shows the
state of equilibrium has been reached at the conclusion of an episode. In Mursi, -ni
indicates a result or a solution which has taken place after a serious of complicated
actions or events.
In narration, it indicates a settlement or an end of a situation with a positive outcome
after a long standing conflict or situation. Examine the following examples.

In both (3.148) and (3.149), the resolutions are outcomes or answers to the question
‘‘so what finally happened?’’. The story behind these two examples is that inThe verb ‘to touch’ is iɲana, and has a root form <iɲ>. In (xxx), there was the first person plural
object suffix -i but has been already assimilated into the root.
24184Mursiland, following the harvest season which takes place twice in a year (DecemberJanuary and June-July), the ɗɔ̀ŋà (middle aged boys) go in large groups into the
cultivation areas and collect the decapitated sorgham stalks (ólʃó). The age grade of the
boys who collect the sorghum stalks is found in Text I (Appendix I). When the
collection of the sorghum stalks is over, the ɗɔ̀ŋà, who collected the stalks, kneel in a
compact group at the tree, facing the rórá (senior), who accuse them, of failing to carry
out the duties of their age grade. This can be very serious if they attack girls while
collecting sorghum stalks because this is not showing sufficient respect to their
‘fathers', the rórá. Therefore this offence becomes ‘Kili’ (as in (3.148)) or it becomes
the issue of the tɛ̀ró (age grade for young men) who attacked the girls (as in (3.149)).
The particle čii is usually used in ironic expressions which indicate astonishment
about something very small. It may be used as a diminutive marker particle and can
appear between the head noun and the modifier within an NP.

3.3.7 Interjections
Mursi has a fair number of interjections which form a small closed class of their own,
a heterogeneous class of words. They mainly serve to express human emotions and
feelings. Unlike other closed word classes in the language, interjections lack fixed
syntactic functions slots. However, a few of them may have clause-initial preferences.
Below is Table 3.15 containing a list of Mursi interjections.

different from the regular internal phonological structure of words. As we recall, both
consonant and vowel length do not exist in Mursi. Phonetic based consonant and vowel
length may, however, exist word-medially. Examples depicting the use of interjection
are provided below.

3.3.8 Ideophones
Mursi ideophones form a separate class of onomatopoeic words. They primarily denote
meanings of actions usually being expressed by action verbs. Aikhenvald (2015: 200)
pointed out that ideophones are ‘sound-symbolic: their phonological form resembles
the sound or impression associated with the action or with the referent’. All Mursi
ideophones, at least the ones listed in Table 3.16 below, consist of mono- and disyllabic
morphemes. Some may occur in inherently reduplicated patterns. jágjágjág seems to
be exceptional in that it has a triplicated pattern.","[205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210]"

farAs illustrated in (10.47a-b), locative case marking suffixes are attached to nouns
referring to both non-specified and specified/specific static places. The other rare as
well as controversial locative marker is morpheme -ni. At this stage I was unable to
make any assertion about its grammatical status ―whether it is a locative case or some
sort of locative suffix. Last and Lucassen (1998) have claimed that the suffix -ni in Chai
(a dialect of Tirmaga, a Southeast Surmic group language) is a locative particle.
However, Bryant (2007: 42) rejected the claim made by Last and Lucassen. Bryant has
noted that -ni is not a locative particle in Tirmaga rather it has a discourse function on
its own. As evidence for this, he presented -ni which can occur where there is no
anaphoric reference to a previously mentioned location. In addition to this, he also
added that anaphoric references to a previously mentioned locations are found in
Tirmaga without the locative suffix -ni.
Mursi and the two languages mentioned above together constitute a single dialect
continuum, and these languages in fact display almost identical grammatical structure
with Mursi. The evidence stated by Bryant about the suffix -ni as having a discourse
function is plausible, but it cannot prevent the suffix -ni from being a locative marker.
484However, what I have observed in my corpus is that the locative suffix -ni often occurs
on postpositions but it does not occur on simple nouns. See the examples below:

The genitive case in Mursi is a case which is marked on nouns or on any other categories
that modify heads of NPs. In particular, common nouns can be modified by other nouns
with a genitive case form. All the modifying nouns must occur in genitive case form
while the head noun must be marked with a modification form (see Chapter 4; §4.2.3).
The morpheme -ɲ is a general genitive case marker suffix and has a number of other
allomorphs.

48610.4 Adpositions
Mursi postpositions are monomorphemic particles suffixed with case markers.
Phonologically, they can be made of two types: simple monomorphemic monosyllabic
roots (as shown in Table 10.4 below; from tójé to rɔɲɔ) and monomorphemic roots in
disyllabic CV1CV1C shapes. Note that the syllable shapes of both types were presented
without their respective case suffixes. Some members of Mursi postpositions are relator
nouns and often occur with an oblique case extensions. Postpositions normally occur
in two forms ―as particles and as particle plus suffixes.

negation of possessionMursi, as it is dominantly a postpositional language (except sábɔ̀ ‘front’ both
postposition and preposition; wùrɛ́ɔ́ ‘behind’ prepositions), it does not correlate with
Greenberg’s Universal principle II. Both sábɔ̀ and wùrɛ́ɔ́ are multifunctional words
such as postpositions (following nouns), as adverb or ordinal number (following some
selected verbs), and as preposition (when used as time words). Thus, in relation to noun
and verb modifier, they may occur in different syntactic positions in a clause.
Greenberg’s universal principle II states that in languages with postpositions, the
487genitive always precedes the governing noun (Greenberg 1966: 45). The fact is that
Mursi is a typical postpositional language but the genitive always follows the noun.
However, Greenberg‘s principle 27 highly correlates with Mursi, it says, ‘if a language
is exclusively suffixing, it is postpositional (p.57)’.
With regard to their morphological status, it is not easy to state whether these
postpositions (other than the grammaticalized body part nouns in the form of relator
nouns) were all once independent forms or bound to nouns as the genitive case markers
on dependents.

Furthermore, as shown in (10.52), postpositions may occur with oblique markers (as in
(10.52a-d) or without them (as in (10.52e-f). The co-occurrence of postpositions and
case markers is not always clear. In (10.53a) below, at first glance, the postpositional
particle bàì looks like a verbal word. The fact is that it is not a verbal word, but it may
488be used as a lexicalized verb form ‘to sit’. Even if this is the case, in some previous
linguistic works on Southeast Surmic languages, this particle is mentioned as an
independent verbal word. The verb ‘to sit’ in Mursi can be referred to by the existential
verb íh ‘to exist/(be) present’ with three term root suppletions /changes depending on
person and number. Postpositions can be moved to a clause-initial position when they
occur with negated verbs, as in (10.53a).

Even if the repetition of bai is not clear as in (10.53b), the relational concept of ‘under
(something), down, below)’ can be shown by repeating it. More interestingly, the literal
expression of the possessive NP (‘your seats’) presents additional evidence to what was
already noted above that bai can serve as the verb (secondary) only when there is no
verb dedicated to the meaning 'sit/stay/exist' in the clause. Therefore, the literal meaning
of ɓáá kɛ̀lčàɲà is ≈ (‘a place for (the purpose of) sitting’) ― (10.53c).

Here, the verb ɛ́l (‘exist.IMPERV.PL’) is prefixed with a passive marker k(V)- and
suffixed with an instrumental nominalizer marker čaɲ. Tentatively, I regard the passive
prefix form k(V)- to be the domain of the emergence of the multifunctional particle
ké/kó (preposition, instrumental, coordinative conjunction, etc.). Note that -ča is a
comitative marker with additional meaning of reason-applicative or purpose. Thus then,489in (10.53c), bàì has a unique postposition function. See further elaborations of the

With regard to the different morphological forms and syntactic position possibilities of
postpositions such that additional spatial relation specification and respective meaning
variation of them appear to be of not much significance. In spite of this solid fact, minor
semantic variations may exist when oblique case marking suffixes are directly attached
to oblique arguments and when oblique case markers attach to normal postposition
particles. For example,

meaning in (a) is, that it tells the specific place of the item. In (10.55b), the oblique case
is attached to the noun and appears in its general function. In this case, the oblique case
marker does not supply specific spatial relation information in relation to the exactness.

10.5Verb-final suffixIn the attempt to understand how different grammatical constituents interact within
sentences or clauses, we shouldn't forget that some minor but important morphological491forms such as verb-final suffixes that might contribute certain pragmatic and semantic
roles in various types structures in which they occur. The verb-final suffix, an
obligatorysyntacticrequirementforaffirmativedeclarative,imperative,hortative/jussive, and negative clauses, is a morphological element that occurs often on
clause-final intransitive verbs.

(unpredictable)(S)VThe verb-final suffixes do not occur on the verb if there is another constituent that
follows the verb. They basically allow the verb to be a focalized constituent. The verb
which contains verb-final suffixes may be the only clausal constituent. At least in
relation to some other constituents in a clause, for obvious reasons, there will be no
constituent other than the verb which is to be made a focal element.

In (10.58c), the verb precedes the object ― which also shows that sentential/clausal
focus always occurs on the element that will take the last position of the clause. The
492preverbal object in (10.58c) is an optional element for the topic under discussion, thus
it is only the verb-final suffix (focus marker) which is always obligatory especially if
the verb is the sole constituent in a clause.

As shown below, the verb-final suffixes in the imperative clauses have predictable
morphological manifestations, except the -o (as in (10.60b). Even for the suffix –o, a
tentative suggestion can be made, i.e. following verb roots that end in vowels.

Comparative construction is a grammatical means of showing two or more items in
order to note similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2012: 343). In order to
make a comparison between two items, there must be at least one quality (essence)
which could be used as a parameter, and that the two items share in common. In other
words, comparing of two or more items involves quality association, an indispensable
approach which would help us to understand where the difference between the items
lies or to what extent/degree the difference between the items in comparison is viable.
One cannot compare two items unless there is at least a single difference in quality
between them, thus the difference comes by means of associating the two items.
As suggested by Dixon (2012: 344), a prototypical comparative construction has
three elements ― the comparison of participants (COMPAREE and STANDARD OF
COMPARISON), the property (PARAMETER of comparison), and the INDEX of comparison.","[506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518]"

Unlike in declarative sentences in which both subjects of intransitive and transitive
verbs are obligatory marked on the verb, imperative sentences always drop markers of
both subjects. In addition, in Mursi, both subject and the object of a transitive verb are
cross-referenced on the verb. Semantically, object of a transitive verb and the recipient/
beneficiary of a ditransitive verb are regarded as primary object, thus, they are crossreferenced on the verb. In the positive as well as negative imperatives, subject of any
337transitivity class is not required, only object arguments are obligatorily marked on the
verb.

There is also an interesting interaction between imperatives and adverbial words (time
and locative). Time words (adverbs) often occur at the beginning of a declarative
sentence.

Locative adverbs are demonstrative constructions referring to distance. Distance

(Lit. ‘in the future morning’)The temporal function of mɛ́á would make sense and be clear if a time reference is seen

Example (7.105) shows a past time reference and refers to a sitation that already took
(7.105)place exactly on the same day, today. In fact it is the tense marker be that made it
possible for us to understand that the whole expression is about something that
happened at some point in the past but has now become a reference to the present
moment. Thus, as shown in (7.105), the past time reference has a distant past temporal
marker bè as its main meaning, and the present time marker mɛ́á indicates that the
temporal situation of past is seen in relation to the present moment.

Even if the meaning and the function of mɛ́á is mostly a momentary temporal deictic
center, its meaning sometimes can be fluid and depends on other relative time contexts.
On the other hand, mɛ́á can be changed into an absolute tense marker in order to express
the time of utterance referring only to today. This is possible by attaching the deictic
clitics to mɛ́á, resulting in two other temporal markers that would help in locating events
that occurred on the same day as the speech events: ŋàmɛ́árɛ̀ and ŋàmɛ́á.

Except for reported speech, one cannot use these two temporal words when speaking
of a past and future time. The two are used as reference or deictic points of a present
moment ‘now’ and ‘today’. Attempting to establish a distinction between ŋàmɛ́árɛ̀ and
ŋàmɛ́á can be complex and irrelevant because there is no clear boundary where the two
precisely denote location in time within ‘today’. Imagine how nonsensical it would be
to try to understand the meaning of the example below in a way other than ‘now/today’.

The addressee is second person thus it is not marked for person in Mursi. If the
addressee is plural, then a plural number marker is added to the verb after the object
marker. The verb ‘to tell’ is a ditransitive verb so it requires two object arguments.íh is an transitive verb in singular form and requires a conjunction particle kó in order to show
reciprocal/joint action.

As illustrated on above examples (7.109a-d) ŋakàlìkena and ŋàhùllùnù have a
d. bècomparable temporal functions in that both locate a situation with the same/exact
moment of the situation.
All these temporal words operate based on the notion of time and deixis vis-à-vis
an established present moment as a reference point. The deictic circumclitics in Mursi
can be viewed in terms of temporal operators in addition to their function in denoting
degree of distance of the speaker in reference to the hearer. They may also serve either
to refer to a speech situation as the reference point as discussed in examples above
(present location and time of speaking), or to refer to a reference point other than the
location and time of speaking. The demonstrative proclitic ŋà= provides a definite
sense to the reference point while the two enclitics (=á ‘near’) and (=ùnù ‘far’) serve
to denote the degree of remoteness from the present moment. Some examples are give
below.

374Being be able to speak about ‘today’ as yesterday is quite an interesting temporality
notion. As shown in (7.111), it is possible to talk about 'today' while being ‘in
yesterday’. A reported speech construction may not be even necessary.
The interaction of aspect and tense is necessary within the main clause where both
are expressed in a way appropriate to the temporal condition of the main clause. This
is the case below in (7.112), where the aspect on the verb of the main clause is
imperfective, but the entire temporal situation of the clause expresses something that
happened in the distant past.

In relative clauses, time words always occur at the beginning of the clause following
the gapping relative clause construction which is always indicated by zero marking.
When the the relative clause and main clause share the same common argument, which
often precedes both clauses, time words may also appear at the beginning of the main
clause. An example of such instance is given below.

ŋànì ‘not yet, still’
The form (ŋànì) often occurs in negative declarative mood preceding the perfective
verb root (see Chapter 13). In the subjunctive mood which expresses the action that has
not yet taken place but that could happen in the future, it occurs before the subjunctive
verb form.

húŋ ‘already’, ‘just, simply’
As a temporal marker particle, húŋ bears the meanings ‘already’ and ‘just’. By carrying
these two meanings, it often takes the position available immediately after the nominals.

Note that the combination of tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ+húllí <why+if> in (7.119b) is a subordinate clause
form which is used to denote ‘wish’. In (7.119b), húŋ follows the predicate, thus it
functions adverbially.
táá ‘already’
The polysemous particle táá has two functions. It can be used as an expectation
temporal word ‘already’, and can also function as an uncertainity marker ‘maybe’. The
examples given below are those that deal only in its temporal function.

7.3.1.5 The completive particle ɓòì
Completive aspect expresses the completion of an event (Payne 1997: 240). In Mursi,
completive aspect can be indicated by the multifunctional particle ɓòì ‘all, at all,
completely’ which usually occurs at the end of the clause following the predicate. In62Although -ča still functions as an instrumental marker suffix, in some cases, it still occurs with some
lexicalized verbal words. Thus, it appears that -ča is on the way of losing its morphological productivity
leaving some verbal words in unsegmentable forms.","[393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401]"

This is a grammar of Mursi (ethnologue code ISO 639-3 muz), a Surmic language which
belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language family. This grammar is the first detailed
description of Mursi language written based on an immersion fieldwork in the villages
of the Mursi community between 2017 and 2019. Consequently, a considerable amount
of examples incorporated in this grammar came from the data collected during the two
years which mainly include an extensive corpus of texts from different genres. This
grammar is also based on a linguistic analysis theoretical framework called Basic
Linguistic Theory (BLT). Following BLT, this reference grammar has incorporated
fourteen chapters covering the phonology, morphology and syntax of the language. The
result is thus a full documentation for the speakers of this little-known language. It is
also a valuable source material for linguists and anthropologists who are interested in
ethnocultural documentations, and for typologists who are interested in the areas of
descriptive and comparative studies of the Surmic Group languages.vTable of Contents

numbering around 7,500 (Population Census Commission, 2007), who live in the
Lower Omo Valley (5° 20' N and 6° 14' N), Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples
Regional State (SNNPRS), Ethiopia. The Mursi are called by alternative names: Murzi,
Murzu, Murutu (see Map 2), Meritu, Dama, and Mùnɛ̀n. The Amhara (the so-called
highlanders or kúchúmbáj by the Mursi) call them Mursi and their language mursiɲa.
Their southern neighbors (the Nyangatom) call them ɲikalabɔŋ1 and their nearest
neighbours the Bodi (Me’en) call them Dama. However, the Mursi2 call themselves
mùn and their language mùnɛ̀n. They speak Mursi (Ethnologue code ISO 639-3 muz),
a Surmic language which belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language family. Their territory
has a size of 2,000 km2 – and is located in the South Omo Zone of Southwestern
Ethiopia. They live in four villages, namely: Mákkí (also known by the Mursi as
Mákó3), Móyzó, Bóngózó, and Rómós (Hayl-Wuha) (see Map 3). These villages lie
between two rivers, namely: the Omo (known to the Mursi Wárr) to the west and the
Mago to the east – and are surrounded two National Parks named after these two rivers
(Omo and Mago) ― see Map 1.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"57114.2.2.3 Causal
Events can also be related to each other through causality by temporal antecedence
marker words with their consequents. In terms of clausal and of maybe subordination
strategies, the causal-consequent clauses are structured almost in the same way as
clause types above. The major difference between causal and other types of clauses is
that causal-consequent circumstances or relations are overtly shown by causalconsequent connectors. These causal-consequent connectors are wùrɛ́ɔ́ ‘after, later’,
ŋàhùllùnù ‘(and) then, after that’, ŋànìje ‘therefore, thus, because of this’, and nà
‘therefore’.

Note that not all the connectors listed above necessarily indicate causal relationships.
But since most of them are temporal adverbs, the temporal order (= the chronological
order of the events in the antecedent and the consequent) would likely suggest the
intended clausal relationship. Likewise, in (14.17), wùrɛ́ɔ́ merely shows a temporal
sequence, not a causal relationship. In causal-consequent clause relations, the aspect of
the verb in the cause/subordinate and the one in the consequent/main clause may vary.
The latter frequently contains imperfective aspect verbs.

‘And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.’
(Lit. ‘And then (and at that time) by of having wind, the sea water trembled.’)(14.18) nàbèThe real causal meaning in (14.18) that tells us the cause of the sea arousal is the
trembling of the water caused by wind, shown by causal marker ba ‘place/cause’.
However, it is possible to indicate this causal-consequent relation without the causal572phrase ba (lɔ̀m) ‘by having’, that is, as long as ŋàhùllùnù is in the causal clause along
with the causal object ŋɔ̀jɔ̀ and occurring prior to the consequent clause. Then two
clauses can optionally be coordinated by the clausal coordinative conjunction nà.
The other cause-consequent marker is ŋànìjè, as we remember from negation Chapter,
is a derivation, ― from the negative perfective ŋànì (or one can call it contrastive
marker particle ‘not yet’ or persistive ‘still’) and the subordinator enclitic =jè.

As it is clearly illustrated here, when ŋànìjè occurs between the two clauses, ― the first
one is the general causal clause while the second is the consequent clause. Mursi has a
complex and unclear distribution of participant nominalization markers some of which
appear to have an agent nominalizers (referring to the actor) and yet others have the
causer agent nominalizers (see Chapter 3). The preposition kó has various functions, ―
the one in causal clause kó1 shows purpose, kó2 preposition, kó3 instrumental, and kó4
could refer to source.
The clause coordinative conjunction nà may also be used to expresses relation of
causality as in (14.20a-b).

3sgtíríbí is a loan word from the Amharic ~tɨrf ‘enough/additional’, and now has a
determiner role in the NP. The absence of the labiodental frication /f/ in the language
has caused the changed into a bilabial stop /b/. Despite the fact that the coordinator is
being used as causal marker, it is the first clause that is treated as the cause for the latter
action.
The temporal/conditional marker húllí itself can also be used as reason marker if it
occurs at its typical syntactic position within the subordinate clause. However, this time
its original temporal/conditional meaning 'when/if' may be modified to a reasoncentered one, ‘since’, and it could semantically be extended into ‘because’. The
example given below tells us this fact.

57414.2.2.4 Reason clause
Reason and purpose clauses are almost identical structurally, but the purpose clause
may be indicated alone without needing a grammaticalized cause marker particle ba ~
ɓa ‘place’. As Heine and Kuteva (2002: 239-40) suggested, a nominal word for ‘place’
can be grammaticalized into cause marker in certain languages. The original locative
meaning will be transformed into causal marker through a gradual process ― which
supposedly denotes the following meanings:
[‘place’ > ‘in place of’ > ‘instead’ > ‘because (of)’ > ‘therefore’ (rarely)]
The following five remarks can best manifest the characteristics of reason clauses as
well as their syntactic temple:
i.bá/ɓá always occurs preceding the causer (sometimes tense marking particles
may intervene between the two).
ii.A purpose clause can have an optional (ii) template but requires the reason
applicative/commitative marker suffix -ɛ for all persons except for first person
plural exclusive and second person plural which are indicated by čo.
iii.The subordinate clause which contains the reason clause may precede or follow
the main clause.
iv.The preposition particle ké may occur in a reason clause, where it precedes the
causal bá/ɓá and shows purpose when reason and purpose are expressed in a
single clause.
v.A reason clause has an obligatory template:
[bá/ɓá…CAUSER…VERB-REASON(=SUBORD)], or along with purpose marker ké
[ké bá/ɓá…CAUSER…VERB-(REASON) (=SUBORD)].","[594, 595, 596, 597, 598]"

nouns3.2.2VerbsA verb in Mursi can make up a full-fledged complete sentence. Such a sentence can
have two objects when a ditransitive verb is being used. Verbs have up to fourteen slots
for verbal grammatical categories. Of these, three are prefixal slots while the rest are
suffixal. Mursi verbs obligatorily are inflected for bound pronominal S/A and O
arguments (participant reference), aspect, mood, motion/direction, valency-changing
derivations, and negation (see §7.3.1 of Chapter 7).
Valence and negation are discussed in Chapter 9 and Chapter 12 respectively. Except
for tense and reflexive action that are expressed by separate grammatical words, all the
other components of non-spatial and spatial setting in Mursi are expressed in the
inflectional system. Moreover, two verbal grammatical categories ― causative and146negation have double markings. The former may be shown by circumfixes while the
latter by circumclitics.
Interestingly, there are a few instances in which the size of the morphological
categories which a single verb root can take, and the syllable shape of the verb root
itself correlate. For example, monosyllabic verb roots usually take as many inflectional
categories as they can. Disyllabic verb roots take less inflections compared to
monosyllabic verb roots. There are a dozen trisyllabic verb roots which take fewer
morphological categories. Ideophone-like verbs may take just one, or sometimes may
not take any verbal morphological categories at all. They rather use auxilary verbs in
order to indicate grammatical information they carry.
However, as exceptions, there are a few monosyllabic and disyllabic verb roots
which take a prefix and just one or two suffixes at a maximum. Verbs such as élí ‘call’,
the auxiliary verb sé ‘say’, an existential verb íh ‘exist, present’, the verb lɔ̀m ‘have’
and polysyllabic ideophone-like verbs are among those that take few inflectional and
derivational categories (see §7.2 and §7.3 of Chapter 7). Although phonological
features cannot serve as criteria to distinguish the verb class from other word classes,
certain phonological features are confined to only verbals. For example, the majority of
Mursi verbs have monosyllabic CVC consonant-final roots. In addition, full suppletion
of roots for a particular grammatical category is a sole feature of the verb class (see
§7.3.1.2.2).
Mursi has also five inherently number-determined verb roots: áʤ ‘give’, kún ‘come,
bring’, ɔ́k ‘go’, íh ‘exist/present’, and ésé ‘sit’. Plural arguments involved in these verbs
are: O arguments for first verb while S arguments for the rest four verbs. All five of
these verbs distinguish aspect by multiple root alternations. That means that each of
these verbs undergo three to four root alternations (§7.3.1.2.7).","[168, 169, 170]"

There is however a difference when first and second person free pronouns are used in
O function. First and second person singular free pronouns are more definite than third
person pronoun singular, which is also used as a dummy/impersonal pronoun. At the
same time, first and second person free pronouns have bound pronominal suffixes
which look like shortened forms of these free pronouns. Moreover, Dixon (1994: 95)
noted that there is a tendency for cross-referencing systems to be normally pronominal,
which have developed from free-form pronouns at some early stage of the language.
This seems to be true for Mursi, for which the first and second person singular bound
pronominal object suffixes -áɲ [-óɲ] <1sg.OBJ> and -iɲ <2sg.OBJ> appear to have
evolved from àɲè ‘I/me’ and ìɲè ‘you (sg.)’. Note that both the third person free
pronouns have no such bound pronominal morphological suffixes to cross-reference
third person O arguments on the verb.
When first and second person pronouns are in O function in AVO order, as can be
seen in the examples given below, bound pronominal O and A argument markers are
attached to the verb. When both subject and object bound pronominal suffixes occur in
a transitive clause, the object pronominal suffix always precedes the subject pronominal
suffix.

In (10.6a), only the perfective bound pronominal suffix -a for the third person A
argument is cross-referenced on the verb while no bound pronominal marking for the
third person O argument is cross-referenced on the verb. Since there is no
morphologically bound pronominal marking for the third arguments in O function, the
constituent order we see in (10.6b) could be unusual with respect to O slots in negated
clauses. Mursi has the non-canonical AOV/SV constituent order for negative clauses,
as it is shown in (10.7).

But, due to the absence of a bound pronominal O argument marking morphological
form on the verb, the negative clause in (10.6b) has no option but to behave the same
way as a clause in the AVO constituent order.
Furthermore, the fact is that most interrogative words in Mursi are pronominal (10.8a)
or pro-phrasal (10.8b). They often occur at clause final slot of the AVO canonical
order― in O function.","[480, 481, 482]"
"102In addition, despite it being functionally limited to certain grammatical categories such
as number and person, Mursi also exhibits grammatical tone. Some examples are
presented as follows.

b. /kìlòj/

HH ‘small stream (pl.)’Apart from the examples illustrated in (2.79) depicting the function of tone as a
grammatical number marker, grammatical tone can also be used to distinguish between
first person and third person subjects in hortative-jussive constructions. In other words,
grammatical tone distinguishes between hortative and jussive moods.

As can be shown in (2.80a-b), the hortative form takes a L-toned verb root or on the
prefix k(V̀ )- because the V is direct copy of the verb root’s vowel plus tone. On the other
hand, the jussive form always carry a H-toned verb root. Both constructions can
optionally be preceded by a free form hortative-jussive particle aj [aɲ]. This particle
always carries an opposite tone of the verb root, for which the two tones form a tone
polarity. Compare examples (2.81a) and (2.81b-c).

"Moreover, sentence-final positions,syntactic slots for core and non-core arguments may typically function as focus-bearing
positions when filled by question words. By using Mursi content questions words, one
can question the referents of clause final argument slots (NPs), location, time, quantity,
and so on. On the other hand, a polar question in Mursi can be formed either by raising
the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at end of a clause or by placing noninterrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement.
Besides, Mursi does not adhere to Greenberg’s Universal Hypothesis 12. Greenberg
predicted that VSO languages always have interrogative words sentence-initially. In
Mursi and in other Southeastern Surmic group languages (AVO), interrogative words
always occur sentence-finally. Syntactically, as long as the O argument a is sentencefinal constituent, the difference between VSO [VAO] and AVO is not significant in
interrogative constructions. Of all interrogative words, tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ ‘why’ deviates from the
sentence-final pattern. The interrogative word ‘why’ has two varieties, one of which,
tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ, can be placed at sentence-initial position when used in some rhetorical questions.
In the light of the two straightforward question construction formation types and other
less common strategies of interrogatives, this chapters presents a detailed discussion of
508the structure of questions of the language. Thus, in the subsequent sections, content
questions (§12.2), non-interrogative particles (§12.3), polar questions (§12.4), and
other questioning strategies (§12.5) in the language are discussed in detail.
12.2 Content questions
Content question words normally fill both core and non-core argument slots. Since
question words occur at clause-final argument slot within strict constituent order, the
original constituents at the clause-final slot can be placed at clause-initial position.
Moreover, content question words are ‘pro-phrasals’ therefore they may come with
marked case and modification forms (cf. Mütze 2014). Content question words are of
two types: question words and interrogative pronouns. This distinction is based on the
properties that question words often display whenever they fill the non-question words’
syntactic slots, because both types of question words can fill whatever position is
natural for the non-question words corresponding to the same slot.

§12.2.8One basic observation that can be made from the forms of question words in Table 12.1
is the reoccurrence of /n/ and /g/ to distinguish between singular and plural numbers.
Typologically, the n/g(k) singular versus plural alternation is one of the most common
areal features, not only in Surmic languages but also in most languages of Eastern
Sudanic. Besides, except the interrogative tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ that can occur only sentence-initially,
all the rest of the interrogative words always occur at sentence-final positions.
Regarding the morphological status of interrogatives, some appear to have
originated from one common form ɔ̀ŋ even if it is not easy at this stage to trace back
how they fused in such way. Especially, many of the question (interrogative) words
appear to have the formative ɔ̀ŋ or -ɔŋ, may be at some point in early stages of the
language. Yet it is possible to analyze some of them as separate forms or morphemes,
for which each segmentable unit will carry its own independent grammatical meaning.
For example, the interrogative word ɔ́nɔ́ŋɔ́ ‘with what?’ is derived from the non-human
A nominative form ɔ́nɔ́ŋ ‘what?’ and the oblique case marker suffix -ɔ. The
interrogative ɔ́nɔ́ŋ itself appears to be a derived form possibly from nɔ̀ŋ ‘3sg’ (or third
person impersonal pronoun) (see Table 12.1) and the nominative case marker -ɔ (as
prefix). As the forms themselves hint, a number of such plausible explanations could
be presented in order to trace back the origins of Mursi interrogative forms,―but they
may not consist of more than three formative.
Last and Lucassen (1998: 415) noted that the form */a-ŋa/ ‘what’ (with a copula)
have been attested in Proto-Nilotic. They also suggested that this could be one of the
oldest question word formation within the Eastern Sudanic language family. For
instance, present-day languages such as Luo (a-ŋɔ ‘what’) and Päri (a-ŋo ‘what’, a-ŋa
‘who’) have maintained the proto-forms.","[531, 532, 533]"

hózò‘hunger’Mursi nouns can be grouped into three types based on how they mark the nominative
case. The three types stated below are based on the way singular nouns behave in
relation to the nominative case. Nouns in the plural form take the invariable
nominative suffix -u.
(i)Type I ― nouns that take the nominative case suffix -o (singular) and -u
(plural),(ii)Type II ― nouns that take the nominative suffix -j (singular) and
-u (plural), and(iii) Type III ― nouns that mark/indicate nominative case by final segment reduction.
For instance, mɛ̀dɛ̀rɛ̀/mɛ̀dɛ́r ‘sheep/sheep.NOM’, rɔ̀sɔ̀/rɔ̀s ‘dog/dog.NOM’, tɔ̀ŋɔ̀/tɔŋ
‘goat/goat.NOM’, gùʃùrɔ́/gùʃùr ‘hyena/hyena.NOM’ and so on. The segment which
is often reduced from noun roots is the vowel -ɔ, in most cases from nouns that477end in this vowel. The case of -ɛ reduction from the animate noun mɛ̀dɛ̀rɛ̀ may be
taken as an exceptional case, if this is the only instance, but we can't be sure at
this stage. See the examples given below:

argument is cross-referenced on the verb. Had it been the NP in O function as a pronoun,
its argument would also being cross-referenced on the verb. In the non-canonical
constituent order (VS/OVA), also an order which enables both intransitive and
transitive subjects be topical/focal, constituents are marked by nominative case.
However, unlike human subjects, non-human post-verbal subjects are subject to
segment reduction, usually for nouns that end in -ɔ. Previous knowledge of the478language's constituent ordering system might help, otherwise it would be difficult to
distinguish the subject from the object in clauses such as (10.35a).

In (10.35a), it is the constituent word order that identifies the two arguments which
otherwise are almost identical and both arguments can equally share the same bound
pronominal suffix which is cross-referenced on the verb. In (10.35b), it is the
nominative case that identifies both arguments that come with strict ordering of the
post-verbal S/A argument.
Nouns that take nominative case morphology may also occur independent of the
strict ordering of post-verbal S/A. In this case, they may occur in NPs that are topical
as well as focal within a clause, as in (10.36).

Even non-animate nouns can behave like subjects as long as they are taking the
nominative case. As can be shown in (10.38), hózò ‘hunger’ is the agent while the first479person object pronominal suffix attached to the verb is the object. It can literally mean
‘I am hit by hunger’.

10.2.3 The non-canonical order (AOV)
The third and the strictest constituent order in the language is AOV. In an AOV order,
due to strict orders of constituents, where negated verbs need to be moved to a clause
final positions, arguments in A function are often forced to appear at clause-initial
position. Unless in few exceptional constructions, this applies to all negated verbs
regardless of the type of clauses or moods in which they belong.

As shown in above negative declarative clauses, both A and O arguments precede the
verbal predicate. Note that in the negative perfective aspect, the third person S/A
argument is marked on the verb as subjunctive marker in the same way as first person480subjects, i.e. k(V)-. The second persons are marked differently from first and third
person subjects, so they do not make use of the k(V)- prefix (as in (10.41)).

Furthermore, the position the O argument in AOV ordered clauses may vary when it is
a pronoun and when it is a simple or common noun. When the O argument is a pronoun,
it has been observed that there is a tendency for the O argument to follow the verb
regardless of the aspect and transitivity (transitive and ditransitive) value of the verb.

As it is shown in (10.42a-c), all arguments in O function are pronouns, for which at first
ORc2.glance it appears to be the case that this applies when the O argument is a pronoun. But,
the second option in (10.42c1) shows that the O argument can also be between the
perfective negative particle ŋànì and the negated verb. In other word, the O argument
now comes in its typical AOV order. From argument structuring point of view, the O
arguments can be optional constituents as long as they are indexed as pronominal forms
on the verb. Otherwise in clauses such as (10.42c2), they can be very ambiguous
especially when the A equals O both in person and number.","[499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504]"

"547With regard to these negative relative clause formations and the semantics which can
be associated with them, the following points need to be taken into account:
(i)Since Mursi is a language that has no grammatical gender, gender related
constructions can be substituted by appropriate nouns or natural gender
displaying words. Thus hírí ‘man’ in (13.25a) may refer to both genders but
it usually refers to a masculine ~<3sg.M>. The noun hòja ‘female’ in
(13.25b) displays feminine ~ <3sg.F>. In fact, hírí alone may be used to refer
to a male referent.
It can refer to a female referent when some natural gender referring nouns
are attached to it. The other justification may be the fact that personal
pronouns cannot be modified (maybe only if they are in relative pronoun
forms).(ii)In order to be modified, the head noun must occur in noun modification
form by carrying appropriate restrictive marker which signals that the
modifier should also have the same form. Thus, both the head and the
modifier relative clause must carry a restrictive modification marker suffix
-a. In a modifier relative clause, the restrictive marker suffix -a not only
functions as restrictive modification marker but also functions as verbal
nominalizer. As can be shown in the above examples, it always attaches to
the right edge position of the verb root.(iii)The restrictive modification plus nominalizer marker -a will always changes
the verb into participle form and the entire construction into nominal phrase.(iv)Subjunctive forms in Mursi always can come in the irrealis mood, therefore,
the verbs always have a perfective aspect. Besides, first and third persons in548the subjunctive forms are shown by k(V)- prefix. As usual singular number
is being shown on the verb itself, whereas plural number is marked by [t/ɗ].
(v)NP heads in demonstrative constructions can be modified but they do not
take a noun modification marker suffix -a, they are already in modification
form. Due to this, the restrictive modification/nominalizer cannot be
attached to the perfective negative verb root (as in (13.25c)).","[570, 571, 572]"
"1.2Linguistic profile of MursiThe linguistic typological profile of Mursi is similar to a certain degree to the Surmic
group languages, particularly to the Suri language. The summaries given below concern
the phonological, morphological and syntactic typological features of the language.
With respect to phonology, Mursi is a language with a fair number of phonemic
distinctions; it has a total of twenty-nine phonemes: twenty-two consonants (see Table
2.3) and seven vowels (see Table 2.6). Mursi, to a certain extent, stands apart from the
rest of the Southeastern Surmic Group languages (particularly from its closely related
languages Chai and Tirmaga), because it does not have the following consonant
phonemes: voiceless bilabial stop /p/, the palatal implosive /ʄ/, and the velar implosive
/ɠ/. The occurrence of the glottal stop is limited in all positions in a word. Due to its
limited distribution, its phonemic status is questioned by some Nilo-Saharan scholars,
but particularly by people who worked on the Southeastern language groups.
However, especially at the level of a phonological word versus a grammatical word
identification, vowels are highly complex, because Mursi vowels undergo a number of
morphophonological processes; including extensive vowel coalescence, harmony,
copying, deletion, change, subtraction and so on. The vowel copying is one of the most
widely spread and recurring morphophonological phenomenon in the language, and it
can occur as a single, double, triple, and quadruple vowel copying term (see Chapter 2;
§2.5.6.5). Vowel height harmony and vowel fronting harmony may also create a high
degree of complexity in the analysis of the properties of vowels. One similarity between
consonants and vowels is that both could have lengthened segments, but length in both
7is phonetically triggered by certain prosodic and phonological processes such as:
lengthened consonants at syllable boundaries and historical intervocalic consonant
deletion.
The maximal syllable template is CVC. A great majority of Mursi verb roots have
monosyllabic CVC shapes. Mursi has also two register tones: High and Low. Both are
contrastive and play significant roles both at the lexical and grammatical levels. It is
worth to note that grammatical tone plays a significant contrastive role in certain
morphological categories such as number, person, and mood.
In terms of morphology, Mursi has three open word classes ― verbs, nouns and
adjectives; and twelve closed word classes: pronouns, adverbs, adpositions
(postpositions and prepositions), question words, number words, quantifiers,
connectors, discourse particles, interjections, ideophones, and expressives (discussed
in detail in Chapter 3).
Mursi is an agglutinating language with some degree of fusion; it is highly synthetic
(up to seven morphemes per word). Mursi is a predominantly suffixing language. Verbs
have up to fourteen slots for verbal grammatical categories. Only a maximum of three
pre-root slots can be available for both inflectional and derivational markers to be added
to the verbal roots at a time (usually a negation marker proclitic followed by suffixes
marking subject, causative, aspect, mood and so on). Generally, as in most members of
the Surmic group languages, Mursi has few slots for prefixes. A Mursi post-verbal root
slot can host a maximum of five suffixes or a combination of both suffixes and an
enclitic. For example, verbal affixes appear roughly in the following order:
(1.1)ŋà=kó-jóg-ón-óŋ-Ø=ó-ɔ̀
NEG.IMPERV=1SU-tell-MT-2pl.OBJ-1pl.INC.SU.IMPERV=NEG-VFS
‘We (inc.) will not tell (it) to you (pl.).’Except tense, which is marked by two relative time referring particles (wa ‘recent past’;
be ‘distant past’) and by other separate time words, bound pronominals S/A and O
8arguments, aspect, mood, motion, and most valency and voice changing devices are
marked on the verb by inflection and derivation.
Morphologically, nouns can be defined as words that obligatorily inflect for number,
case, definiteness, and can occur with deictic categories. Nouns could have up to ten
affixal slots for nominal grammatical categories. There is only one pre-root slot for
deictic category and nine other post-root slots, of which four are shown by enclitics.
Number on nouns can be shown in a number of ways and by two types of morphological
forms: suffixes and clitics.
As many Nilo-Saharan languages, Mursi has a complex number marking system.
Thus nouns are divided into four sets based on how they mark number: ‘replacive’,
‘marked plural’, ‘singulative’, and ‘suppletive’. Some nouns utilize a tripartite number
marking system; ‘river’ kíɗó (singular), kíɗóì (singulative) and kíɗɛ́n (plural). A few
other nouns may utilize more than one plural suffix: ‘silver bracelet’ érésí (singular),
érésíó (plural) and/or érésíɲá (plural). Interestingly, close kinship nouns stand apart
from the rest of noun types in that they can be marked by a special plural number
marking suffix -čo. A total of about 70 portmanteau number markers are found in the
language, and all are suffixes (see Chapter 6). Nominal morphological categories
usually display the following affix-clitic orderings.

‘Those (field) watchings (vigils)’There are four morphological categories that can be encoded through double marking:
two on verbal words and two on nominal words. Of the four, two are encoded through9circumclitics (negation on verbs in the imperfective aspect and demonstrative system
on nouns). The third grammatical category, which is shown by double marking is
causative. Thus, causative derivation in Mursi can be shown by morphological markers
circumfixed directly to the verb root. The fourth grammatical category to be shown
through double marking is genitive case. It is a very rare feature in that it is the only
grammatical category in the language to be indicated by an identical marker in a
successive manner, as in (1.4)

people-RSTR
big.PL-RSTR local-GEN-GEN
‘Village elders’ (Lit. big (pl) people of the local area’)Mursi utilizes a complex aspect marking system, and aspect falls broadly into two
categories: imperfective and perfective. Roughly, aspect can be shown on verbs in the
following ways: by bound pronominal subject marking suffixes and by a number of
different verb root alternations and a morphological phenomenon. The verb root
alternation is quite complex and roughly one-third of Mursi verbs have different root
forms for imperfective and perfective aspects. This includes full suppletion, partial
suppletion, final consonant reduction/deletion, final syllable reduction, and multiple
alternation. There is also one morphological phenomenon, i.e. prefixing t(V)- onto verb
roots in the imperfective aspect (see Chapter 7; §7.3.1.2).
Mursi is a nominative-accusative language and has a canonical constituent order
AVO (for a transitive clause) and/or SV (for an intransitive clause). Core-arguments in
this constituent order are functionally-unmarked. In addition to this, depending on
clause types and pragmatic context, two other constituent orders are also utilized: an
AOV order (in negated clauses) (as in (1.5b)), and an OVA in a transitive clause and
VS in an intransitive clause where post-verbal subjects (S and A) are marked for
nominative case (as in (1.6)).","[30, 31, 32, 33]"
"Thegrammaticalization process which generates these indefinite pronouns is more or less
the same as that which generated those mentioned earlier. In addition, Aikhenvald
(2015: 195) noted that indefinites can be the basis for negatives. Likewise, àhìtì
‘nothing’ and àhìtì ɗɔ́nɛ́j <[thing.SG-RSTR one]NP> ‘nobody’ are among those
indefinites whose meaning may also denote negation (see also §13.6). In the following

3.3.1.6 Relative pronoun
Mursi has two relative pronouns that are derived from specific pronouns in §3.3.1.2.
They are ìní ‘who/that/which (sg.), and ìggì ‘who/which (pl.)’. Even though both can
function pronominally, they are not prototypical relative pronouns. Both can be
head/common argument of a relative clause. As a derived subclass of pronouns, they
are morphologically deficient thus they must always occur with the non-restrictive
marker suffix -i. Carrying the non-restrictive marker suffix may enable them to accept
a wide range of modifiers from various word classes to modify the head. In other words,161with the help of these relative pronouns, any clause having a relative clause structure
can modify the head, as illustrated below.

3.3.2 Adverbs
Adverbs in Mursi are members of a small closed word class and whose main syntactic
function is modifying verbs. Five subclasses of adverbs have been found in Mursi:
manner (§3.3.2.1), time (§3.3.2.2), frequency and degree (§3.3.2.3),
emphatic/intensifiers (§3.3.2.4), and locative (position and direction) (§3.3.2.5). Not
all adverbs occur simply in natural adverbial forms. Some can be formed from
adjectives with the help of the general adverbializer suffix -o[-no]. Some have
identical forms with adjectives. They can only be distinguished from adjectives by
their syntactic functions or by the syntactic slots they occupy in a clause.","[183, 184, 185]"

As we can see in (14.107b), the coordinand to be referred to by the second coordinator
is not mentioned, thus the second coordinand can either be recoverable from the context
(small or …?) or has been substituted with the expression ―‘small or comparable’.
A similar meaning may be expressed with the correlative type disjunctive coordination,
by placing the disjunctive coordinator kóó before the first coordinand and by negating
the second coordinand. I called this one a kóó…NEG type.

621In addition to the correlative coordinator 'either…or', Mursi has a system to express
'neither…nor' . This type of correlative coordinator is often used in contrastive negative
coordination. In this type of coordination, two negated coordinands will be coordinated
by kóó ([‘X’ NEG+verb or NEG+verb]).

over cattle looting and grazing land. So, then he suddenly became emotional and started
telling the story with an irony by involving himself as first speaker.

7.3.1.2 Aspect
Mursi utilizes a complex system of aspect marking that can be subsumed within two
broad categories: imperfective and perfective. Regarding these two notions, a
straightforward definition is as follows. Perfective indicates ‘the view of a situation as
a single whole, without distinction of the various separate phases that make up that
situation; while the imperfective pays essential attention to the internal structure of the
situation’ (Comrie 1976:16).
In light of the above holistic definition of imperfective and perfective, Mursi sets
certain mood and voice categories into one of the two aspectual categories. For instance,
an imperfective verb root is used for negative imperative mood while the perfective
verb root is used for positive imperative, hortative/jussive and subjunctive moods. The
passive voice also utilize the perfective verb root. All categories of mood are discussed
in §7.3.1.2.
Aspect in Mursi is mostly associated with full verb root. Aspect is shown on verbs in
the following ways ― (i) by bound pronominal subject marking suffixes (§7.3.1.2.1)
and (ii) a number of different verb root alternations and morphological phenomena
(§7.3.1.2.2- §7.3.1.2.7). Each of these aspect marking categories clearly indicate the
imperfective and perfective aspectual distinctions.","[335, 336, 337]"
"519For example, ɓónnój in (12.22) does not refer a particular place or location so it may
mean also ‘what’. Compare the following examples : the answer to question (12.22) a
question of its' answer could generate a particular location, and (12.23) may not
necessarily have such interpretation.

12.2.5 ísɔ̀ŋ ‘how many/much’
Any sentence containing the quantitative interrogative word ísɔ̀ŋ ‘how many, how
much’ is one that questions a quantifiable, countable/non-countable, number of
referents.

In fact, the noun gáwá ‘price’ (lit. ‘market ≈ week’) has contributed to the meaning of
‘what’. In the absence of gáwá, this sentence would be ‘how many pencil’ ― just
referring to the quantity instead of the price. The difference between these two
meanings of the question word ísɔ̀ŋ ‘how many’/’how much’ requires further study. If
the question is presented as in (12.24b), the possible replies would involve a lexical
520number word either as copula complement or as modifier of a head noun within NP, as

During my long corpus collection in the Mursi community, one important point that I
(12.25) a.learned from Mursi speakers is that their preference for specific types of grammatical
constructions out of many other types mostly depends on stylistic and ideolectal
differences. For instance, (12.25a1) is more preferred than (12.25a2). In addition to
‘how many’, using ísɔ̀ŋ, one can ask questions such as ‘how much’ and ‘how old’.

12.2.6 nɛ̀ŋ and nój ‘who’
The interrogative pronouns nɛ̀ŋ and nój refer to the identity of human referents. The
interrogative pronoun nɛ̀ŋ can occur in O function either following a main verb or a
copula verb. There are two main syntactic slots in which nɛ̀ŋ occurs: direct object of a
521transitive verb and extended argument of a ditransitive verb. nɛ̀ŋ may not be marked
for object case by an overt morphological form because it is inherently an object form
in its own right.

In (12.29), nɛ̀ŋ is in peripheral function and represents a human referent participant in
the joint action carried out with the A. When a joint state/action involves an
intransitive verb, inherently plural verb form may be used, as in:

On the other hand, the interrogative pronoun nój may occur at the same syntactic
position of the nɛ̀ŋ, but in a different function. nój mainly has a human reference
when it occurs in nominative form.

Mursi does not have an interrogative word dedicated for ‘which’. However, nój may
also be used to enquire ‘which’ type of questions. Dixon (2012: 411) noted that ‘who’
can only be used as head of an NP. It could replace ‘which’ as in ‘which X’ if ‘X’ is a
noun with human reference (as in (12.32)).

As it is shown in (12.32a), the number of the referents has been indicated by the verb
to be (also singular existential verb form). Besides, nój is not a modifier since there is
no noun to be modified. However, in (12.32b), the plural specific/relative pronoun is in
a modified form and the modifier could be any noun since the modification/relator
marker attached to it is non-restrictive. Further study is needed to see whether nój is
used to refer to non-human reference.The singular counterpart of (12.32b) is as follows.

Both interrogative pronouns with human referents were used in the above examples.
The function of the interrogative pronoun nɛ̀ŋ in both constructions is simply part of
the language's question construction strategy. Finally, nój may be used to ask about a
non-human referent, as in the example given below.

The suffix -e attached to the interrogative pronoun is unusual and/or has unclear
function. In most cases, second person singular subject suffix is omitted if a motion
suffix is attached to the verb.
Note ―I mentioned earlier that Mursi lacks an interrogative word for ‘which’.
Although my position is still the same, two unusual forms that appear to have a
'which' reading have been attested in my data. They are inój ‘which.SG’ and gioj
‘which.PL’. As shown in the examples given below, both interrogative forms can refer
either to a human referent or a non-human referent.

In Turton and Bender (1976: 540), the two have been mentioned as ainoi (singular)
and agyoi (plural). They are alike with the forms in (12.35a-c) despite a slight
difference from Turton and Bender's suggestion. The segment a of the ainoi and agyoi
is a copula verb ― and the final segment is approximant rather than a high vowel.
Despite the fact that in Mursi there are some fused grammatical forms which require
further investigation, in fused form gìój in (12.35b), the form -ój is a nominative case
marker; since it follows the copula verb.
12.2.7 nì and gì ‘whose’
The interrogative pronouns nì and gi are singular and plural possessive forms of ‘who’.
Both nì ‘who.GEN.SG’ and gì ‘who.GEN.PL’ occur in modifier position within an NP.
Consequently, any noun that may replace these two possessive interrogative pronouns
is required to occur either in genitive case form or in possessive form. The head noun
form remains unchanged, ― it always occurs in modified/modification form.

The possessive interrogative pronouns nìnì ‘who.PRO.SG’ and gìgì ‘who.PRO.PL’ appear
to have CV duplicates of the genitive forms ― nì and gì. The major difference the
genitive forms is that both nìnì and gìgì can occur in full pronoun forms. This means
they may occur as modifiers of NP heads, but in order to stand on their own as predicate
nominals or as copula complements, they do not necessarily require to occur in genitive

number clitics (as proclitic as well as enclitic) ― in which they indicate only the
526grammatical number of referents (possessors) and the possessed items. They can be
segmented into separate pieces of morphemes. They can even be glossed in almost
equivalent way as possessive pronouns.
12.3 Non-interrogative particles
Non-interrogative particles have different grammatical functions in the language. In
interrogative sentences having non-interrogative particles, the particles (see below in
Table 12.2) can be in a particular discourse context, for instance if the information was
known and in circulation for some time in the past, and/or if the information is believed
to contain hidden facts in a way that creates an exclamative or a dubious situation.

where interrogative sentence construction is possible without a verb overtly stated. In
addition, the uncertainty particles ká ‘perhaps’ and tá ‘maybe’, which are not
interrogative words on their own, but they may denote interrogative sense in the

"3.2.3AdjectivesAdjectives comprise the third largest open word class in Mursi. Adjectives comprise an
open class just by derivation. Without their derived members, adjectives would have
formed a closed class consisting of just two members ― tííní ‘small’ and búí ‘big’. Due
to their phonological and morphosyntactic properties they display, I have labeled these149two adjectives as 'underived'. Thus the two form one of the smallest subclasses of
words in the language (see §8.2.1 & §8.3.1).
Adjectives share a number of grammatical properties with nouns and verbs. For
example, adjectives may be marked for number in the same way as nouns. When
modifying the head of an NP, they may take nominal grammatical categories such as
case and definite markers, as in (3.57).

grammatical properties with verbs than nouns. Both adjectives and verbs share the
following categories: bound pronominal S/O arguments, passive-nominalizer,
comparative-benefactive (own term), negation and verb-final suffix. The following
examples clearly show the grammatical categories that both adjectives and verbs have
in common (repeated from §8.4.2)

Syntactically, adjectives can modify the head of an NP, fill the head of an intransitive
predicate slot, fill copula complement slots, denote degree of the compared quality in
comparative constructions, and function as manner modifiers.
The adjective class of Mursi covers all semantic types that can be conveyed by
adjectives. A total of about 160 adjectives have been identified in this study (see
Chapter 8).

question words, number words and quantifiers, connectors, interjections, ideophones,

"452Chapter 10
10.1Grammatical RelationsIntroductionGrammatical relations in Mursi are marked by constituent order and case. According to
(König, 2006:657f.; Dixon 1994:63ff), Mursi is a multilayered language in that it
utilizes a constituent order AVO/SV (neither the A nor the S arguments can be
unmarked for nominative case) and the OVA/VS order in which post-verbal A and S
arguments are for marked-nominative case. However, case-marking is often employed
depending on the constituent order system of the language. Mursi is a nominativeaccusative language. Although Mursi utilizes case-marking, it is also a head-marking
language that has cross-referencing bound pronominal forms to indicate grammatical
relations. As a head-marking language, it has participant reference markings on the verb
which predominantly indicate grammatical relations. This operates by indexing bound
pronominal A and O argument affixes on the verb. In clauses with ditransitive verbs,
argument indexing on the verb often operates according to referential prominence scale
hierarchy and verb-adjacency constraint principles.
There is no single rigid and imperative approach of analyzing the relations of
constituents within individual languages from multiple but plausible morphogical,
syntactic and semantic approaches. This is often possible, however, if and only if the
analysis make sense for a particular instance such as to indicate relation of constituents
within a clause. And above all, if the analysis conforms to the basic grammatical
properties of the language under description. While the treatement of case marking
strategy in Mursi largely depends on syntax, the discourse prominence of arguments
such as animacy and definiteness are indispensable tools that enable us to understand
the way in which pronouns and nouns function in clauses.
453For example, free pronouns in the S or A function of the canonical constituent order
SV/AVO will in no way be marked for case, nor will it trigger any morphological
markings which may indicate the relation of constituents in a clause, whereas in a noncanonical OVA/VS constituent order, pronouns in S/A are marked for nominative case,
thus now encode further pragmatic function, i.e. focus/topic. For example, in a copular
clause, the first person plural pronoun in CS function precedes the copula verb, as is
always the case in the canonical order ―àggè kánó ‘We (exc.) are’. Or to turn this into
a question clause, the copula verb should be moved to a clause initial position, i.e. kánó
àggè? ‘Are we?’. But, to put the focus on the CS, the same pronoun but in nominative
case form will be inserted between the copular verb and the unmarked form pronoun,
as in (10.1).
(10.1)k-án-ó
1SU-COP.IMPERV-1pl.EXC.SU
‘Who are we?’àggè-ò
1pl-NOMàggè?
1plSince the copula verb is now at clause initial position, the marked-nominative pronoun
is in line with the principle of ‘‘case after the verb’’, in contrast to ‘‘no case before the
verb’’.
For what appear to be due to the morphosyntactic and pragmatic interaction of
constituents in the non-canonical order, post-verbally Mursi nominals in markednominative case form can often function as either topical-S or topical-A.
In this chapter, among many, are two major topics which have been discussed in
detail, each of them are typologically rare and could perhaps be typical features of
Mursi. These are Noun Modification Construction and marked-nominative case. The
noun modification construction system of Mursi is the bearer of genitive case, whereas
the locus of marked-nominative case and other grammatical cases that mark both core
and non-core constituents is in the canonical and non-canonical constituent orders. Thus
454this chapter of grammatical relations shall present various morphosyntactic topics
which particularly deals with constituent order (§10.2), case marking (§10.3),
postpositions (§10.4), and verb-final suffix (§10.5).
10.2 Constituent order
Mursi has three types of constituent order: canonical AVO/SV, non-canonical OVA/VS
where the A/S is marked with morphological marked-nominative case suffixes, and
non-canonical OAV (a somewhat a strict constituent order of negation). With respect
to grammatical relations, each is dealt with in subsequent sub-sections below.","[475, 476, 477, 478]"
"2.7.3.1 Compounds
Mursi has a few compounds―mainly noun-noun and noun-quantifier. A compound
word is one grammatical word consisting of two phonological words. Compounds can
easily be recognized as having two forms either from the same word class or from two
different word classes, and by bearing no dependency markers (relators). For example,
the restrictive and non-restrictive relators -a and -i/-ti on the head of an NP. Mursi has
five types of compounds ― noun-noun, noun-verb, noun numeral/quantifier, adjectiveadjective, and adverb-adverb.
(2.83)(2.84)(2.85)noun-noun
a. /sábáwànné/[sábá-wànné](head-pain)‘headache’b./dóríkέŋɔ́/[dórí-kέŋɔ́](house-belly)‘floor’c./dórítàrár/[dórí-tàrár](house-roof )‘thatch’noun-verb

b. /čáhɔ̀lí/
(2.87) adverb-adverb
a. /kàlìkɛ̀ŋɔ̀/
b. /hàlíɓɛ̀lè/109In compounds, as they are typically composed of more than one phonological word,
word boundary associated phonological rules may apply to the last syllable of the first
compound word. For example in (2.85b), the noun zùgò ‘people, the final vowel may
be elided at any time. So, the root zùg undergoes a lenition process /g/→[Ɂ] followed
by deletion of /g/ because */Ɂɗ/ clusters cannot be permitted in any environment (recall
deletion and lenition rule in §2.5.3). Finally, we will get the truncated form zù.
Compounds are the only one which raise mismatches between the two word types.
In Mursi, two clitics can make up one grammatical word, however, they do not form a
separate phonological word on their own. Only the two circumclitics (of demonstratives
and negations) seem to be eligible for coming together and form a full-fledged
utterance.
(2.88)a. /ŋà=Ø=á/
DEM=Ø=NEAR
‘Here’→ [ŋáà]b. /ŋà=án=ó/
NEG=COP.IMPERV=NEG
‘It is not’→ [ŋà=Ø=ó] ~ [ŋà=Ɂ=ó] ~ [ŋájò]In (2.88a), there will be no nominal form which intervenes between the demonstrative
proclitic ŋà= and the distal marker enclitic =á, whereas in (2.88b), a copula verb root
in the imperfective aspect has intervened between the negation circumclictics. The
glottal stop /ʔ/ is inserted between the boundary of the two clitics, nonetheless it is
pronounced as a lamio-palatal glide <j> in fast speech. In addition, tone assignment to
a floating clitic is another issue for further study.
2.7.3.2 Reduplication
Reduplication is not productive in Mursi. However, there a few reduplicated words,
mainly occurring in two types ― those that are composed of two phonological words110but form one grammatical word, and those that constitute one phonological word and
one grammatical word.
(2.89)a. /kɔ́b/ ‘follow’
/kɔ́bkɔ́b/ [kɔ́b.kɔ́b]
b. /dàrì/ ‘to move secretly’ /dàrdàr/
[dàr.dàr]
c. /kɛ́ɗ/ ‘cut’
/kɛ́ɗúkɛ́ɗú/ [kɛ́ɗú.kɛ́ɗú]
d. /jàg/ ‘return (tr.)’
/jágájágá/ [jágá.jágá]
e. /búí/ ‘big (sg.)’
/bíbí/
[bí.bí]
f. /tííní/ ‘small (sg.)’
/tíítí/
[tíítí]‘quickly’
‘to steep downhill’
‘cut in to pieces’
‘go back and forth’
‘big (pl.)’
‘small (pl.)’g. zùwò
[ɗɔ́nɛ́.ɗɔ́nɛ́]
people
one:REDUP
‘Everyone’ (Lit. people one-one.)
As it is shown in the examples above, reduplication can be full (as in (2.89a-b), where
a full and unreduced phonological word form is copied. Or it could be partial (2.89c-d)
which involves segment reductions from the coda of the first phonological word. In the
case of full reduplication, monosyllabic verb roots are reduplicated whereas. in partial
reduplication vowel alternation and even deletion may take place. In (2.89a), the high
back vowel /u/ is deleted and instead replaced by the general adjectivizer suffix -i, i.e.
búí > bí. Since the reduplicated form bíbí+í > bíbí constitutes one grammatical word
instead of two, therefore, it takes only one adjectivizer suffix at a time. Likewise,
without a change in functional meaning, the numeral ɗɔ́nɛ́j ‘one’ (2.89e) is used as a
numeral. Note that ɗɔ́nɛ́j ― may sometimes appears in its full form, but drops the
approximant /j/, depending on the speech speed of speakers.
The second types are those with inherent reduplication consisting of one
phonological word and one grammatical word. They cannot be decomposed into two
distinct phonological words. Hence, phonological and grammatical words coincide.

‘become loose’As we can see in both examples (2.90), they are morphologically deficient in that they
do not take grammatical markers. Therefore, inherently reduplicated verbs may require
an auxiliary verb sé ‘to say’ (2.90a) or some other support verbs. Not all of these
inherently reduplicated words clearly indicate boundaries of the reduplicants. For
example, ɓíɓíʃí and ɓɛ́ɗɛ́ɗɛ́g could have had *ɓiʃɓiʃi /*ɓɛɗɛgɗɛg, but co-occurrence of
consonant cluster restrictions are to be taken into account. Accordingly, neither *ʃɓ nor
*ɗg cluster is allowed in any environment. Someofthesemanticsthatthereduplicated grammatical words could carry are repetition, plurality, and distribution.","[132, 133, 134, 135]"

14.3.1.2 Contrastive coordination
In Mursi, clauses can be coordinated by the contrastive coordinative marker ŋànìjè ‘but,
however’. The contrastive coordinator ŋànìjè always occurs at clause medial position,
and its primary role will be introducing a contrastive proposition. The examples
illustrated below are repeated from (14.32) and (14.12).

615As is shown in (14.93 – 14.94), the contrastive coordinator is a clause medial
constituent, and usually introduces a counter-proposition or counter-presuppositional
proposition that is contrary to the first clause. Since negative and contrastive clauses
tend to often be similar in Mursi, whenever the first clause is negative, ŋànìjè whose
function is marker of a contrastive in the second clause may indicate a counterexpectation of the first clause, ― or add a contrastive emphasis by focusing on the
second clause.

D,I,+,O2.4Syllable structureThe maximal syllable template is CVC. A great majority of Mursi verb roots have
monosyllabic CVC shapes. Just very few monosyllabic verbs may optionally contain
CVC1(C2), where C1 stands for the liquids and nasals ― gɛ̀rs ‘bad’ and báns ‘fly, stand
up’. Apart from these two, four other basic syllable shapes have been identified: V, VC,
CV, and CVV. Of these, the CV is the most frequently occurring syllable shape in the
language. The distribution of CVV syllable shape is very much limited, only confined
to few words containing phonetic vowel length (see §2.3.7). Some discourse particles,
interjections, and ideophones may contain syllable shape which are quite different from
those of regular word classes, for example ɪmm ‘no (disagreement marker)’ and ɪɲɲ
‘yes (disagreement marker)’ (see also §2.3.3). This is, however, the norm with
discourse markers and ideophones. Deviation in the syllable shapes of small and closed
word classes is often triggered when liquid and nasal consonants occurring at the coda
position.
2.5Phonological processesMursi has most complex sound processes which touch on almost every aspect of the
grammar. Although some sound changes may be irregular as they pass through a
number of phonological processes, the majority of the sound changes often have rules
by which they are governed. Some may seem common and areal. For example, many
of the word-final consonant deletion rules typically apply to both Southeastern as well
as Southwestern Surmic languages. Quite a few of the common phonological processes
are specific to the individual language thus only apply to Mursi. Therefore the
subsequent sections provide detailed account of the phonological processes which
occur in simple words as well as in morphologically-complex forms.","[99, 100]"
"147The syntactic criteria are the primary ones which clearly distinguish the verb class
from other open and closed word classes. Syntactically, all Mursi verbs are categorized
into the following four transitivity classes: intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, and
ambitransitive (also known as ‘labile’). The first two transitivity classes will account
for nearly all of the verb classes. Only three ditransitive verbs have been found in my
corpus: áʤ ‘give’, jóg ‘tell’ and ɗól ‘show, announce’ (see Chapter 10). Mursi has quite
a few labile verbs. Verbs such as táb ‘deceive/lie’ has ‘labile’ (A-S) nature of its own.
Interestingly, verbs with a VC syllable shape are associated with labile nature (S=O and
A=S) (see §7.2.2.1). Verbs can function as head of a transitive as well as intransitive
predicates. The only other word class which functions as head of a predicate is an
adjective. But adjectives which do so belong to one particular subclass of adjectives,
i.e. only those that are derived from stative verbs can function as head of an intransitive
predicate.
Based on semantic criteria, Mursi verbs can mainly be divided into two subclasses:
active and stative. Aikhenvald (2015: 91) noted that active verbs are those that primarily
denote a process or a volitional activity. They include motion and posture verbs. These
types of verbs form the largest subclass of verbs in the language. On the other hand,
stative verbs are those that mainly denote states ― mɔ́ɗɔ́s ‘be tired’ múɲús ‘be angry’,
lɔ́tɔ́g ‘be wet’, ɗɔ́rɔ́s ‘dry’ and so on. Mursi stative verbs are the major source for
more than one-third of derived adjectives (see Chapter 8). Moreover, stative verbs are
usually associated with heads of intransitive predicates ― as a verb subclass and as an
adjective subclass (derived adjectives).
Other small closed subclasses of verbs are copula verbs (§7.3.1.2.9 and §14.2.5) and
auxiliary verbs (§7.3.1.2.10). Both these two subclasses are morphologically deficient148in that they only inflect a few verbal categories. Copula verbs may be inflected for S
arguments, negation, and mood (only subjunctive), as in (3.55).
(3.55)àɲè ŋà=k-án-í=ó
1sg NEG=1SU-COP.IMPERV-1sg.SU.IMPERV=NEG
‘I am not’Therefore, a copular clause consists of a predicate (semi inflected copula verb for these
three categories), and two core arguments ― copula subject (CS) and copula
complement (CC). As pointed out by Dixon (2012: 159), copula constructions primarily
indicate five major semantic relations: (i) identity, (ii) attribution, (iii) possession, (iv)
benefaction, and (v) location.
In Mursi, the first four relations can be shown by copula verbs. Like copula verbs,
auxiliary verbs can be inflected for bound pronominal S/A and O arguments. In addition
to these, an auxiliary verb may be inflected for mood (passive and hortative-jussive).

‘But, while we are collecting, and if they come and take the stalk things
that are ours…’ (KW 0:48:2)7.3.1.2.9 Copula verbs
Copula verbs in Mursi share a number of morphosyntactic properties with regular verbs
and occupy the verbal position like any other verb in the canonical constituent order CS
COP CC. However, when copula verbs function as predicates in a copular clause, theybear a number of special semantics associated to their syntactic position. The
morphological property of copula verbs is discussed below. Copular clause is discussed
in Chapter 14. Except for third person, copula verbs are also inflected for person and
number like regular verbs.

form of the imperfective aspect while te ‘was, became’ is the base form of the perfective
aspect. We know that the third person singular subject suffix is not marked on verbs in
the imperfective aspect. In such cases, there may be a possibility of deletion of the
base's final segment (alveolar nasal) word-finally, i.e. /an/ ~ [a]. However, this only
makes sense for the third person singular form of the imperfective aspect. Interestingly,
when the third person form is negated the real form emerges. Compare the following
examples:

‘They are not’As we see (7.28b2), the negated form of the third person copula verb is the real form
and it occurs as ŋàánó [ŋàɁánó]. The glottal stop /Ɂ/ is often epenthesised between a
proclitic that ends with a vowel and a root that begins with the same vowel. Whereas in
(7.28c2), the copula form ŋàájó often occurs in free and lexicalized form and there is a
tendency to epenthesise the palatal approximant /j/ to block a sequence of three vowels
when segmenting is required. In fast speech, however, only ŋàjó is recognized and it327can be used as independent (free-form) negative copula word/particle denoting a
meaning ‘not, it is not, are not’7.3.1.2.10 Auxiliary verb
In a number of Semitic, Cushitic and Omotic languages of Ethiopia, the verb ‘say’ has
wider functions among which is that it can be used to derive verb idioms and can be
conjugated with other verbs as an auxiliary verb. Apparently, similar functions of the
verb ‘say’ are attested in some Nilo-Saharan languages of Ethiopia, at least in the
Southeast Surmic group ― Mursi and Suri (Chai-Tirmaga-Me’en). The verb sén ‘to
say’ appears to be the base form in the imperfective aspect. It is inflected for bound
pronominal S/A and O arguments but it doesn’t take full verbal inflections. For
example, it cannot be negated and used in imperative construction. When an imperative
form is needed, there is another verb which substitutes and is used to deliver a
command, i.e. ― jog ‘say, speak, tell’.

cases, they are often marked for person and number of the subject while the main verb
that follows can be fully marked for the necessary agreement inflections. The semantics
associated with auxiliary verbs include the expression of desire, intent, perception,
uncertainty and so on.

CVVOne indication that clitics are prosodically deficient is that the phonological properties
which apply to enclitics may not apply to proclitics. For example, vowel height and
rounding harmony rules apply to enclitics, however, they do in no way influence
proclitics. No Mursi affixes exist that I know of which are exempted from these two
vowel harmony rules. Table 2.11 is a comparative summary between clitics and affixes
on the basis of phonological properties they display.

Table 2.11. Phonological properties of clitics and affixes
2.9 Special phonology
Interjections, ideophones and expressives may have forms that are quite different from
the regular internal phonological properties of words, especially with regard to syllabic
structure. As we recall from §2.3.3 and §2.3.7, Mursi has neither consonant length nor
113vowel length. However, phonetic length of both types exist in the language. The former
type is trigged by gemination whereas the latter is due to an intervocalic consonant
deletion. Contrary to this, we may find that the consonant and vowel lengths
interjections, ideophones and expressives are not phonetic neither. Table 2.12
demonstrates the peculiar sound and sound patterns displayed in interjections,
ideophones and expressives.

Table 2.12. Phonology of interjections, ideophones and expressivesFor example, in Table 2.11 above, expressives can easily be recognized by having
simple monosyllabic patterns composed of C1VC2 (CVʃ ) shapes (where C2 stands for
voicless postalveolar fricative [ʃ]). There are no such phonological restrictions on any
other types of word classes as to what a word must include or exclude at the wordfinal positions.
2.10 Female register
There are quite rare and peculiar differences between female and male speech registers
in Mursi. The speech registers in Mursi happen mainly due to physiological effects in
speech production. It is a peculiar instance in which Mursi's female or male speech
114production physiological organs are partially affected by their traditional practices such
as body beautification, body scarification, and body ornamentation. Yigezu (2001:203)
has noted two traditional practices in the Chai people: (i) the lip-plate piercing tradition,
which was imperative for any girl attending puberty, but currently is optional tradition
being practiced by girls of the same age; (ii) the cultural practice of removing the lower
incisors in both ― female and male. Like the Chai society, the Mursi have similar
traditions traditional practiced by both sex groups. In terms of typological similarities,
there is no language closer to Mursi than Chai.
In Chai, as Yigezu (2001: 208) noted, three possible strategies are employed in
compensating for the loss of the lower lip: (i) place of articulation is maintained if the
manner changes, (ii) manner of articulation is maintained if the point of articulation
changes, and (iii) both the place and the manner of articulation change. Yigezu has also
mentioned three consonant changes happen based on the three ways of compensating
for the loss of the lower lip: (i) Strategy I ― [b] > {β}, [ɓ] > {w} and [β] > {ф, (ii)
Strategy II ― [b] > [d], [ɓ] > [ɗ], [s] > {θ}, [p] > [t] and [m] > [ŋ], and (iii) Strategy
III ― [b] > [ð].
In Mursi, as shown in these Categories, the alveolar fricatives /s/ and /z/ can undergo
a simplification process to their dental allophone counterparts [θ] and [ð]. The voiceless
alveolar fricative /s/ becomes [θ] word-initially and intervocalically (Strategy I)
whereas its voiced counterpart /z/ becomes [ð] intervocalically (Strategy III): /s/→ [θ]
/ {#__ or V__V} (/sízzì/→[θízzì] ‘three’, /kásáj/→[káθáj] ‘sand’; and /z/ → [ð]/ V__V
(§2.5.4). Strategy I is directly associated to Mursi‘s lenition rule, in which,
intervocalically, the voiced bilabial stop /b/ lenites to the voiced labial fricative [β] and
the bilabial glide [w]. The general morphological process that explains lenition of /b/
intervocallically is called intervocalic spirantization; and has a rule: /b/ → [β/w]/ V__V115(see §2.5.3). The rule that governs Strategy III is available in §2.5.4. Similar to Chai,
in Mursi the production of the following consonant sounds are partially affected by the
lower lip piercing tradition (cf. Yigezu 2001: 203-221; 2005: 241-257; Lüpke (2010:
6ff.); see also §1.7.3.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"
