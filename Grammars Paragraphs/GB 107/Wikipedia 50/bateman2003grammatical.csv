A tone 4 is used on statement particles in Iau to indicate that the speaker is not using the
statement to control the conversation and is not giving information that is directly about the
topic. A tone 4 is frequently used on statements of opinion, reactions to previous statements or
side comments. The following is an example.
A. Bv⁷ te⁷
ae⁶
to⁹.
this husband Neg-RES.PUN RHr-SC.A.DT
She has no husband!
B. Y⁵
Au⁷ i⁸si⁴ba⁷ be⁷
to⁴.
Exclam 3S big
is-TOT.INC RHr-SNC.NA.NDT
But, she is already grown.
The statement above is taken from a conversation about the marital status of various people. The
statement above is a surprised reaction to the previous speaker's statement that the girl in
question is not married. The statement marked by tone 4 is not directly about the topic of the
marital status of various people. The speaker is giving it as a reaction and reason why he said
what he said, but is not using it to oppose the hearer or to control the topic, so he marks it with a
tone 4.
10.2 Responses And Exclamations
Iau has a variety of particles used to indicate positive and negative responses. The following is a
list of positive response particles and their meanings.
di⁴ to³ Yes, of course that's right.
di⁴ y³ Yes, that's right.
di⁴ da⁷by⁹ Yes, didn't you know that?
di⁴ be⁷de⁷ to⁴ Yes, that must be right /Yes, that seems right.
e⁸fe⁹ Yes, that's right.
by⁷by⁹ That's true. /That's the way it is.
ay⁸ Yes, I will; Yes, I understand; Okay
dy⁴ dy³ Yes, you go ahead and do that.
The following is a list of negative response particles used in Iau and their meanings.
Bai⁶e³ No, that's not right; No, I won't.
Ba⁶⁻³ No; Well, actually....
bav⁵ I don't know.
The final group of response particles listed below are used to express the speaker's feelings in
response to a given situation.
Y⁶!`expresses displeasure'
Y⁵! `expresses need to comply with speaker opinion /proposal'
Ai⁶av²! `a lament, response to something negative'
Y⁹v⁶ ` Oh!Oh! ('A⁹ bai⁸si⁷ to⁹’ I slipped/fell)
The exclamation y⁶! indicates displeasure over something that has happened. It is heard
frequently in the village when an owner returns to find that a dog has eaten his food, or when a
child has gotten into mischief. The speaker uses the particle y⁶ to announce and assert his
displeasure to the community at large.
The exclamation particle y⁵ emphatically emphasizes the speaker's viewpoint or the need for the
action he is proposing. The following is an example taken from a conversation between a health
worker and a villager reporting to the health worker about a man with a bad cut.
A. Fi⁴au⁷ di⁸ be⁹ y⁴.

Exclam-SC.A.NDT Oblig lift
da⁸
ba⁷
ka⁷ dy³.
carry-RES.DUR come-TOT.INC Emph Imp-RS.SA
Well then lift him up and bring him (here).
By using the particle y⁵, the speaker indicates that the situation requires action. The speaker takes
control of the conversation by ending the discussion of symptoms and changing the discussion to
what should be done about the problem.","[125, 126]"
"46Tone 5
Tone 5 has a different temporal viewpoint from tone 9. It points forward to future time as the
time of realization of the action or fact. It can talk about a pending situation in the past or one
that is future pending.
The following example is about an intended action and whether is was true and about to be
fulfilled or not. The tone 5 on the particle dy indicates that it was in fact an intended action and
about to be fulfilled at the time under discussion (past).
Di⁹y³, to⁸ bv⁶ di⁷
se⁴
dy⁵ .
Yes
pig 1s kill-TOT.INC Int-URLZ IrPnd-NPresFACT
Yes, it was a fact that I was about to kill the pig.
The example is about a frustrated action. The question being answered it. Was it a fact that you
were about to kill the pig yesterday but you were interrupted. The speaker uses the final particle
dy⁵ with a tone 5 non present fact marker. It was indeed a fact yesterday, but no longer is true
that he is going to kill the pig.
By far the most common occurence for the tone 5 epistemic modality morpheme is on the
intention particle se⁵. It is the most common tone on statements of intention.
A⁹ ui⁸
bv⁸ i⁷
se⁵ .
1s house to go-TOT.INC Int-NPresFACT
I am going to go to the house.
Tone 5 meaning non-present fact, also occurs frequently on negatives as a emphatic contrastive
negative. that is is not at all, didn’t at all ,
Ba⁶⁻³ y⁸ to⁶
a²
i⁷
ae⁵.
No 1P Contr land-by go-TOT.INC Neg-NPresFACT
No, we did not (emphatic contrastive) go by land at all.
The non-present orientation of tone 5 enables it to act as an emphatic contrary to expectation on
negatives. The speaker here is refuting a wrong assumption for the other speakers in the
conversation.
The following example is of tone 5 on the di particle. It marks the totally bounded definite event
as not true at present.
Da⁷ ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸
di⁹
di⁵ ?
dog this who NMkr hit-TOT.PUN PBd-NPresFaCT
Who shot at /hit this dog?
In the sentence above there is no one hitting or wounding or killing the dog at present. But there
is some evidence someone has, or some information about something having happened.
Tone 6
Tone 6 establishes a propostion as fact in the immediate temporal context. The following is an
example using tone 6.
Au⁷ so⁶ ae⁶
y⁹.
3s child Neg-C.FACT Info-SC.A.DT
She has no children.
The negative particle with a tone 6 means `there is or there are none'. In the negative statement
above, tone 6 indicates that the proposition `She has no children' is an immediate fact, ie a fact
at speech time.
Tone 6 only occurs on the negative particle. Although tone 6 immediate/current reality only
occurs on negatives. It does occur on a several temporal adverbs which all have to do with the
current temporal status or the previous situation. It seems that on these particles the tone has a
similar meaning a current immediate situation.
da⁶ now
u⁶ before now
i⁶ now for a short time (‘I⁶ bv⁸ bai⁷ de⁸ dy³’ means wait a minute /Iwill be right with you.)47Tones Viewing An Unrealized Proposition As Possible or Hypothetically Possible (7,4)
Both tones, 7 and 4 view the action as unrealized.
Tone 7
Tone 7 when it occurs on postverbal particles usually establishes a hypothetical fact as
illustrated below:
Da⁹ ka⁶di⁸ be⁷
di⁹
y⁹ da⁹
2p many is-TOT.INC PBd-FACT Nomin 2p
di⁸
di⁷
y⁹.
kill-RES.DUR PBd-HYP Info-FACT
If you had been many, you could have killed it.
On negative particles, tone 7 ‘hypothetical’ means “could have been, but wasn’t, or never would
be. The following is an example.
Ty⁷ bi⁷si⁹

di⁷ y³.

2S take-TOT.INC PBd-HYP Inf-SNC.A.DT
If you had not killed that person, then you could have taken me (as wife).
In the example below, the proposition marked by tone 7 is not totally negated. It is a possible
reality even though the speaker is negating it.
Si⁶tai⁹si³ bv⁶ to⁶ o⁷
ai⁷.
widow 1S Cntr take-TOT.INC Neg-HYP
I don't think I will ever take a widow (as wife).
In the final example, an indirect request, the speaker views the realization of the proposition as
desirable and possible as marked by the tone 7 reality status morpheme.
Sy⁹ di⁹ bi⁷si⁹ a⁹ ti²
di⁷
y³.
Obl 2S one 1S give-TEL.DUR PBd-HYP Info-SNC.A.DT
You should give me one if you will.
Tone 4
Tone 4 marks and unrealized action as pending. It is viewed as about to be fulfilled. This comes
out in various ways when combined with various post verbal particles.
This following sentence repeated from above, illustrates the use of a tone 4 epistemic modality
marker on an intention particle to mean “about to”
Di⁹y³, to⁸ bv⁶ di⁷
se⁴
dy⁵ .
Yes
pig 1s kill-TOT.INC Int-URLZ IrPnd-NPFACT
Yes, it was a fact that I was about to kill the pig.
The se particle above marks plans and intentions. The tone 4 epistemic modality morpheme
indicates that the realization of the intention was pending but not yet implemented. In this case it
is translated as ‘about to’ (when interupted.)
The following is an example of a pending realization tone 4 morpheme on the inceptive
unbounded particle ay.
Ty⁷ ai⁷bv⁹ te⁷bv⁹ a⁹fa³

Why have those people gathered?
Ty⁷
ui⁸
o⁸sy⁹ davy⁹
ay⁴ .
person house 1sPos build-TOT.PUN DIBd-URLZ
They are about to begin building a house for me.
The unrealized action of the tone morpheme 4 on the unbounded a particle, results in the
meaning, “still doing /doing again”. The speaker is exasperated, thinking the person would have
finished doing the activity by now.","[46, 47, 48]"
"44Evidential Particles
Evidential particles in the Iau verb phrase evaluate the truth properties of the proposition they
mark and also the information source, marking what is commonly known or given information.
The following is a list of evidential particles that occur following the verb with some sample
sentences. Da, bede, fi, da⁷by³, di⁷dv³,

combination with the negative ae⁷ means it should never should have been a reality.

Epistemic Tone Morphemes
The set of epistemic tone morphemes in Iau view the temporal and realis occurrence conditions
of the verbal situation and evaluate it according to degrees of factiveness or realization. They
also comment on the temporal characteristics of that reality, These same status morphemes occur
on stative, negative, modality, status and evidential particles.
T2 Meanings of Status Tone Morphemes on Iau .
Tones Establishing A Proposition As Fact (9,5,6)
Tones 9, 6 and 5 establish the proposition as fact.They vary in terms of when that proposition is
being viewed as fact. Tone 9 is by far the most common FACT establishing tone on the Iau postverbal particles. Tone 5 is next because it occurs so frequently on intention statements.
Tone 9
Tone 9 is inherently totality of the action /proposition and punctual viewpoint. So it views the
situation as a fact at some time (past, present, future, or hypothetical) in order to comment on it.
The following examples of tone 9 on the particles di, be and se illustrate the use of the epistemic45modality tone morphemes to assert or establish a proposition as a fact at some time in the
discourse.

In the example above, the factivity of the proposition has been called into question. The tone

fact.

In the example above the making of knives is regarded as a fact. The particle be which marks a
continuative situation that has now been stopped, indicates that the time period for the act of
making knives was in the past.
The following is an example of tone 9 on a negative:
Negative FACT: `did not, will not, is not, do not'
Di⁹ to⁶ ba³tu³ sa⁸

2s Contr corn eat-RES.DUR Neg-FACT Uncer-RS.SA
You do not eat corn do you?
The sentence about is a yes no question where the assumed answer is “No”. The negative
proposition “you do not eat corn” is viewed as fact by the speaker, as indicated by the tone 9
marking on the negative. The yes-no question particle gives the person the option of refuting or
clarifying the assumed fact.
Tone 9 can also occur on unbounded habitual or general truth statements

5.1.3.2 Epistemic Modality:Status and Evidential Particles
Epistemic modality is a sub-type of linguistic modality that deals with a speaker's
evaluation/judgment of, degree of confidence in, or belief in the knowledge upon which a
proposition is based. In other words, epistemic modality refers to the way speakers communicate
their doubts, certainties, and guesses—their ""modes of knowing"".
Status
Evidential+T² Cl
Temp Bound +T²
di,be,ay,a
da+status tone
dybe+status tone
In Iau following the negative slot in the verb phrase, there is a slot for status particles and after
that a slot for evidential particles. These particles comment on realis properties of the marked
event, the characteristics and degree of definiteness of it’s occurrence, mark the speakers
evaluation of its truth and relationship to common knowledge.
The following are some examples.

5.1.3.1 Negatives
Negatives in Iau are marked either by the particle ’ae’ ‘state of non-existence”. or the particle
‘ai’ ‘(cause) become or irrealis non existent’. These particles immediately follow the verb or the
verb and the clitic stative particle if present. The following are some examples.

The first sentence above is an example of a simple negative statement, `The actor did not do x.'
The next two sentences, in addition to the negative particle ae also have the contradictory particle
to⁶ indicating that the speaker is contradicting or refuting previous information in the discourse.
The final sentence is an example of a negative negating a stative verb.
The addition of the status /epistemic modality tone morphemes to the negative particles
distinguishes eight different kinds of negatives in Iau. Each of these negative types is illustrated
in a sentence below.

In Iau there are two different ways that a command can be passed through a intermediary. The
following examples illustrate these two ways.
1. Au⁷ sy⁹ i⁷
bv³.
3s shld go-TOT.INC Request
He should go. /(Tell him) he should go, if he is willing.
2. Y⁸ boi⁸

to⁴.
come-TOT.INC Imp shld happen RfHr-SNC.NA.NDT
We are going to get firewood. You are supposed to come /should be coming too./(She said)
you have to come too.
The first example above passes the command along in the form of a polite request. The bv³
particle in Iau is used to request permission or instruction from the hearer as to what he wants to
be done. The second example above uses the particle di²⁻⁷ to indicate that the speaker and the
originator of the command expect the hearer to comply but feel that the hearer may be resistant.
The verb is marked by the command particle dy.
9.8 Requests for Permission or Direction
The bv³ particle in Iau is also used to mark requests for permission to do something or requests
for the hearer to tell the speaker what the speaker should do. the following are some examples.
1.A⁹ i⁷
bv³?
1s go-TOT.INC Rqst
Shall I go? /May I go?
2.A⁹ te⁸bai⁵ ui⁷
bv³?
1s where stand-TOT.INC Rqst
Where shall I stand? /Where do you want me to stand?
In both of the examples above the speaker is giving the hearer the opportunity to tell him what
he, the hearer, wants the speaker to do.
9.9 Prohibitions
Prohibitions are negative commands. They command the hearer not to do something. In Iau
prohibitions are marked by two different particles that occur together, dy⁴sy⁷ meaning `shouldn't'
and day³ meaning `negative command'. The following prohibition is an example.
Di⁹ dy⁴sy⁷ i⁷
day³.
2s shldnt go-TOT.INC Prohib
Don't go! /You shouldn't go!
Iau also has statements which are used as indirect prohibitions. These statements are marked by a
contrary to desire particle fe in Iau. The negative obligation particle dy⁴sy⁷ `shouldn't' can also be
used in these statements. The following are some examples.
1.Si⁸a⁷da³ doe⁷
fe⁷⁻⁸.

2.Ty⁷ dy⁴sy⁷ y⁸ di⁸

They might kill us (and we don't want that to happen).
The examples above are used in contexts where the speaker is protesting against or rejecting a
proposed action because he foresees an undesirable consequence.
9.3 Statements
Statements in Iau that convey information to the speaker can be marked by a number of sentence
final particles that indicate the speaker's attitude toward the information content of the sentence.
The following is a list of the Iau statement marking particles.
y
iyan answer, opinion, observation, announcement
speaker is an expert, hearer is ignorant
120to
e
byinformation is being used to refute or contradict the hearer
information is being used to explain or justify another statement
information in the sentence is a prediction speculation or recommendation based
on knowledge or experience
ba /be
probable or possibly true information
The statement particle y is the most commonly occuring statement particle in Iau. The particle y
marks answers, opinions, observations, comments, announcements, and statements of wishes or
desires. The following are some examples.
1A. Di⁹ te⁷bv⁸ i⁹
a³?

Our women quickly get married (ie marry young).
The particle iy is used when the speaker feels that he has expert or `inside' knowledge in contrast
to the hearer who is ignorant on the subject. The following sentence is an example.
Ba⁶⁻³ da⁶ a⁷se⁹

Man tie to-TEL.DUR MUbd-FACT is-TEL.INC InfoU-SNC.ADT
Well, our (women) wait and then (later) they are married.
The example above is taken from the same conversation as the previous example. The first
speaker has given information about marriage customs in his culture. The following speaker
gives information about a contrastive custom and indicates that this is contrastive inside
knowledge as compared with what the hearer knows by using the particle iy.
The particle to in Iau is used to indicate that the speaker is using the information in the sentence
to contradict the hearer in some way or he is expressing surprise or shock. The following are
some examples.
1.Bv⁷ te⁷ ae⁶
to⁹.
this man Neg-FACT RHr-SC.ADT

2.Ai⁶av²! Dy⁴ so⁶ av⁷bv⁹ bv⁸ fe⁷su⁷
to⁴.
Exclam then child his
for feel pity RHr-SNC.NA.NDT
That's too bad! I'm shocked and sorry for his children.
In the first example above, the speaker is contradicting the previous speaker's assumption that the
woman is married. The particle to indicates that she is not just informing the hearer that the
woman is not married but is also indicating that the previous speakers question is not relevant
because the assumption on which it was based is wrong. The second example illustrates the use
of the particle to to indicate that the speaker is shocked or surprised by the news he has heard.
The Iau particle e is used to indicate that the speaker is using the statement to justify or explain
his action. The following conversational excerpt illustrates the use of this particle.

The final particles in Iau verb phrase are deontic modality particles which express mood and
illocutionary force.

Contrary to opinion,
emphatic Given/Known
InfoThe segmental mood particles that fill the mood/illocutionary force slot in Iau are used to
indicate the speakers intention regarding the information role of his proposition in the
conversational discourse.They have to do with speaker hearer relationship and intent towards
each other as well as the content of the proposition expressed. The intent may be to convey
information, opinion or assert a fact. It may be to ask for information or it may be to obligate
either speaker or hearer to action. A promise or statement of intent is used by the speakers to
obligate themselves. A command with various levels of mitigation of that command is an attempt
by the speaker to obligate the hearer. Following the mood slot is a slot used by the speaker to
convey that the information is or should be already known to the hearer. It is in effect an
intensifier of the command, promise or statement being made.
Segmental Mood Particles
. These mood particles are optional in Iau. They occur mainly in dialogue in conversations, and
as embedded dialogue in narrative or other discourse genre. When the speaker's primary focus is
to convey the information in the proposition, no mood particle is used. When the speaker uses a
mood particle, he is not only conveying the information in the proposition, he is also conveying
information about the dynamics of the conversational discourse and his relationship to the hearer.
The following sentences illustrate this.
A⁹ a⁷se⁹
u⁶
fvy⁶.
1S SeqMkr before bathe-RES.PUN
I have already bathed before (you /now). /I bathed earlier.
A⁹ a⁷se⁹
u⁶
fvy⁶
to⁹.
1S SeqMkr before bathe-RES.PUN RHr-SC.ADT
I have already bathed (It is not as you seem to think).
In the first example, the speaker sees the hearer obviously on her way to bathe and volunteers the
information that she, the speaker, has already bathed. In the second example, the role of the
proposition in the discourse is to refute an assumption or previous statement of the hearer that the
speaker still needs to take a bath or is going to bathe.
The segmental mood particles in Iau can be classified according to two basic functions. One set
of particles marks propositions whose role is to give information to the hearer. The tone
morphemes on these particles indicate which participant in the opinion of the speaker is
controlling the conversation and also what the relationship of the information is to the discourse
topic.
The second set of particles marks propositions whose role is to elicit a response from the hearer.
These are imperatives of varying illocutionary force and question markers. The tone morphemes51on these particles indicate the degree of speaker authority, the degree to which the speaker needs
or anticipates hearer response, and which participant controls the realization of the proposition.
The meanings of the segmental mood particles are discussed below. The meanings of the tone
morphemes are discussed in the following section,

Tone Class Resultative Verbs (6)The resultative punctual tone, forms the last class of Iau verbs. The resultative verbs focus on the
result of an action. They are inherently undergoer or experiencer focus, as illustrated by the
following examples:
di⁶ get /be startled
bai⁶ beach /put to shore (a canoe)
e⁶ to exclaim,cry out
(a⁵) tai⁶ touchdown!/has landed (plane)
bav⁶ wither and die (plant)
kavy⁶ wiggle/move (eg a rock)
These verbs do not have any other variant tone in their class. Whether in combination with
various epistemic and deontic modal particles, and negatives, and in medial verb clauses as well
as main clauses, their tone does not change. They view the action as punctual and resultative.

6.1 Constituents Of Iau Clauses10
The layered clause structure presented in Van Valin (1993) is a helpful model for discussing
clause constituents and their ordering in Iau. In Van Valin's model, the clause constituents are
defined semantically rather than grammatically. The clause consists of three layers, nucleus, core
and periphery. Each layer is separated from the others by operators. The operators are particles
carrying grammatical categories such as aspect, modality, directionals, negation, evidentials and
mood . The operators are juxtaposed to the clause level constituents they modify or operate on.
For example nuclear operators are located at boundaries between nuclear and core constituents.
Likewise core operators are located at boundaries between core and peripheral constituents, and
peripheral operators are located at the clause periphery. Each of the three clause layers and their
operators will be discussed below.",[71]
"1169.1.9 Questions about Descriptions
Iau has a variety of ways of asking for a description of an unknown object. The following
questions can all be asked to elicit a description of an object.
1.Kei⁹ bv⁷ te⁸de⁹?

What is a turtle? (more of a request for explanatory discourse –includes description)

9.2 Commands In Iau
Commands are one of a class of utterances used to get the hearer to do something for the
speaker. Requests, wishes, desires, suggestions, and prohibitions are examples of other kinds of
utterances that are used to express what the speaker wants the hearer to do in a less direct way
(mitigated commands). These utterances all differ in the degree of obligation that the speaker
places on the hearer. Iau has several different kinds of particles and tone morphemes that are
used to express varying degrees of obligation. Each of the different types of commands will be
discussed and illustrated individually below.
9.1 Simple Commands
A simple command in Iau is formed by adding the command particle dy³ following the verb and
by changing the verb stem tone. The following command is an example.
1.I⁷
dy³.
go-TOT.INC Imp-SA.RS
Go!
The verb i⁹ `to go' usually has a tone 9 on it. In commands, just like yes-no questions, the tone 9
is changed to a tone 7. Tone 7 means that the action is either incomplete or that it has not
happened yet. Tone 5 verbs change to a tone 4 and tone 3 verbs change to a tone 8. These tone
changes are illustrated in the commands below.
1.Au⁷ foi⁴
dy³.
3s tell-TEL.INC Imp-SA.RS
Tell him!","[116, 117]"
"Coordinate NP’s in the LDP slot
Coordinate noun phrases can also occur in the LDP as illustrated by the following examples
from narrative texts.
Example 1
Ty⁷ bo⁴ be⁷,
boi⁸ av⁷bv⁹ bv⁸ke⁷ y³ av⁷bv⁹ bv⁸ke⁷ a⁷se⁹ ...

be⁷⁻⁸de³ da⁷ be⁷⁻⁸de³ a⁷se⁹ ...
bow and
net bag and
dog and
SqMkr
(He got) his bow, his dog and and his net bag.
The examples above show two types of coordinate noun phrases in LDP's.
6.1.5 THE SPACERS
As shown in the sections on the LDP above, each LDP can be followed by a spacer, a pause, or a
potential pause. Most of the examples of spacers in the preceeding sections have been with the
sequence marking particle a⁷se⁹. But other core markers are also used in the spacer slot.
The following are used as spacers in Iau.
Modality Markers:
sy⁹ Obligation
dy⁴sy⁷ (+Mood day³) Prohibition, shouldn't do it
(presuppostion)
Negative:
to⁶ (+Negative) Deny /Negate False Presupposition
Intraclausal Relators:
sa⁴ Contrastive Action
sa⁴dy⁴ Contrastive Result /Resultative Exhortation
sa⁴dy⁸ Exhort Contrastive Action based on previous Grounds
Grant Permission for Contrastive Action
be⁸sy⁹ Exhortation/Action Proposal -Based On Grounds Already
Presupposed
Focussed Event -Result of Previous Means Eventline
or of Collateral Results

be⁴dy⁴ Event is Result of Previous Reason Eventline
Event is Conclusion /Exhortation on Basis of Previous83Grounds
Temporal Adverbs:
be³di⁹ later /Future
u⁶ before /Past
da⁶ now /Present
Event Sequence Marker
a⁷se⁹ SqMkr
6.1.5.1The Sequence Spacer a⁷se⁹.
In addition to it's spacer function and topic introducing function, the a⁷se⁹ particle is used in Iau
in discourse to mark events that are in a sequential relationship either to each other or to the time
of speaking as illustrated in the following examples.
Sequence Example 1
Di⁹ _a⁷se⁹_ taui⁷ di⁸ ba³?
you SqMkr make Bd ?Mkr
Have you _already_ made it?
Sequence Example 2
a. Ty⁷ fv⁷ ae⁶
da⁸dv⁹
person canoe NegExist MClCj
b. _a⁷se⁹_ bv⁸ i⁷ da⁸dv⁹
SqMkr for go MClCj
c. _a⁷se⁹_ tay⁵ davy⁹.
SqMkr scaffold build
a. When a person does not have a canoe, then b. he goes to (a canoe
tree) c. and builds a scaffolding.(1st step is cutting down a tree for the canoe)
As illustrated in example 1, the a⁷se⁹ particle marks the event as occuring prior to speech time. It
can be translated `already'. Example 2 shows the a⁷se⁹ particle marking a procedural eventline. It
marks the first event and all subsequent events on the eventline.
The a⁷se⁹ particle is used in combination with the temporal adverbs u⁶ `before' and be³di⁹ `after'
to mark chronological gaps in the eventline.
Example 3
a. Y⁸ da⁷ da⁸ i⁷ se⁵
we dog take go intend
b. dy⁴da⁸dv⁹ y⁸ _a⁷se⁹ u⁶_ di⁹ bay⁵.
IndClCj we SqMkr before food give
When we are going to take a dog hunting, then we _first_ give him some food.

Tone 9 in the first column of the chart above indicates that the Speaker considers himself to be
the participnt controlling the discourse topic and the information about discourse topic.
Furthurmore, tone 9 on a statement mood particle indicates that the speaker is asserting the
information as nuclear or core information about the discourse topic.
Statements marked by tone 9 are used in conversational discourse on answers that challenge the
information content of the question or answers that assert the speakers control of information
unknown to the hearer. The following sentence is an example.
Dy⁴ so⁶

de⁹?
then child how many Sta-FACT
Spkr 1 And how many children does he have?
So⁶ ai⁶
y⁹.
child Neg-RES.DUR Info-SC.A.DT
He has no children.
In the example above, Speaker B uses a tone 9 on the statement mood particle y to indicate that
he intends to challenge the basic assumption of Speaker A and assert contrastive information
about the discourse topic.
In contrast to tone 9 in the first column of the chart above, tones 3 and 8 in the second column
indicate that the speaker does not control discourse topic or the flow of information about
discourse topic. The information content of the statement, however, is being asserted about
discourse topic. Most answers to questions in Iau are marked by a tone 3 on the statement mood
particle as illustrated by the following example.
Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶
ba⁷
ba³?

Spkr 1Is the plane coming tomorrow?
Di⁹y³. Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶ ba⁹
a⁹
y³.
yes plane tomorrow come-TOT.PUN DUbd-FACT Info-SNC.A.DT
Spkr 2 Yes, the plane is coming tomorrow.
In the example above Speaker 1 marks hi2answer to Speaker A's question with a noncontrolling
tone 3 morpheme. The tone 3 morpheme indicates that while Speaker 2 is asserting the
information in the statement about discourse topic, he is not the participant who is controlling
discourse topic or the flow of information about discourse topic. He is responding to Speaker 1
by providing the requested information.
Tone 3 morphemes can also be used on statements that give furthur information on an already
introduced topic as illustrated in the following example.
Ay⁸ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ fv⁷ doe⁷

yes Benjamin plane see-TOT INC Neg-RLZ SubClCj
dy⁴

y³.
do that D.UBd-RLZ Info-SNC.A DT
Yes, since Benjamin had never seen a plane before, he acted like that.
The example above is taken from a segment of conversational text about being afraid of riding in
planes. The preceeding speaker has just answered that although he wasn't afraid, his companion59Benjamin held onto him the whole way because he was so afraid. The sentence in the example
above marked by tone 3 is a furthur comment on the topic of being afraid of riding in planes. The
sentence above provides information on one of the reasons that people are afraid when they ride
in planes.
In contrast, furthur remarks that give contrastive information are not marked with a tone 3
noncontrolling morpheme but with a tone 9 speaker controlling tone morpheme instead. The
following example illustrates the use of tone 9 on a contrastive furthur remark.
Ay⁸ Au⁷sy⁹ ai⁷bv⁹ fi⁴be⁸ dy⁴dau⁸ de⁷

I see. When our (girls) are like she is (the same age), then they are quickly /soon married to a
husband.
The participants in the conversation above are discussing the marriage status of various people in
the village. Speaker 2 is surprised that a certain girl is still unmarried. Speaker 1 explains that
their custom is to wait until the girls are a little older. Speaker 2 in the sentnece above then offers
a contrastive statement that in his village, the girl would have already been married. The
contrastive statement giving furthur information is marked by tone 9.
The tone 8 morpheme is also speaker non controlling. In addition, the tone 8 morpheme indicates
that the information in the proposition is of immediate contextual relevence. The following
sentence is an example.
A⁹ a⁵ taui⁷
sa⁹
y⁸.
1S land work-TOT.INC Int-FACT Info-SNC.A.CR
I am going now to work in my garden.
The sentence above is taken from a conversation about what each participant is doing. The
example above is the answer to the question, `What are you going to do?' In the discourse
context, the speaker is on his way to the garden. The information in the statement is of
immediate relevence in the discourse situation since the speaker is currently engaged in bringing
the action about.
The tones in the final column of the chart above, tones 7 and 4, are also speaker noncontrolling.
Tones 7 and 4 also tend to mark responses such as answers and furthur remarks or opinions.
Tones 7 and 4 contrast in that tone 7 marks statements whose information content is directly
about the discourse topic while tone 4 marks statements when the information is not directly
about the discourse topic.
The following is an example of a tone 7 morpheme on a statement.
So⁷ fi⁴au⁷ be⁸ be⁹?
tree Inten tall ?Mkr-NI
Spkr 1And the So tree very tall?

Ba⁹ tv⁹
dv⁹ y⁷?
Exclam do what-TEL.DUR.CHS Neg-HYP here go away-TOT.PUN (?) Info-SNC.NA.DT
Spkr 2 You are not kidding! It was way up there!
Many occurrences of tone 7, like the example above, are on highly idiomatic verb phrases. The
question mark glossing the particle dv is used to indicate that the exact meaning of the particle is
unknown. The general meaning of the statements is clear from the context and discussions with
native speakers. In the example above, the speaker is giving a highly emotive response to
Speaker 1's question. Speaker 2 uses the tone 7 morpheme to indicate that the fact that the tree
was tall should not even have been called into question.
Tone 4 morphemes mark statements that have backgrounding functions in the discourse. The
information content of the statement marked by tone 4 is peripheral not nuclear to the discourse
topic, ie it is not directly related to the discourse topic. The following example illustrates tone 4
marking information that is not directly about the discourse topic.","[58, 59, 60]"

Iau3 is a Papuan language spoken by over 1500 speakers who live along the Van Daalan River, a
southern branch of the Tariku /Rouffaer River in the Western Lakes Plains area. They are located
in the District of Fawi, Puncak Jaya Regency, Papua, Indonesia. (Ethnologue). GPS coordinates
for the main village of Fawi are: 03 13.86S 137 43.56EThe Lakes Plains Languages were originally grouped with the Tor languages to the northeast as
part of the Trans New Guinea Languages (Wurm 1982, Voorhoeve 1975), but more recently with
the Geelvink/Cenderawasih Bay Languages such as Bauzi, Tunggare, and Burate (Clouse,
1997), And by some as an independent family (Ross 2005, Usher ) (See also Wikipedia).
The Iau dialect trio of Iau, Turu, and Foi along with Edopi are classified by Usher (2018) as
West Tariku4 languages as opposed to the Wapoga River, Central and Duvle-East languages.
The Glottologue makes the Tariku (River) languages into a broader grouping, which includes
East Tariku, Central Tariku, Duvle and West Tariku. In this classification Iau and the other 2
dialecs are classed as Central Tariku. Iau is also classified as a Central Tariku lanugage in
Clouse’s classification of Tariku (1997) which consists of six families—Tause, West Tariku,
Central Tariku. East Tariku, Duvle and West Lakes Plains.","[1, 2, 3]"

Multisyllabic words carry stress.
Stress on indigenous Iau dissyllabic words falls on the final syllable.
e⁸i⁸ shoes (foot-skin)
sa⁶i⁸ clothes (leaf-skin?)
i⁶su³ hair (head-hair)V-V
CV-V
V-CVAs stated above, most Iau two syllable words are morphologically complex. Shoes is actually
foot-skin. Shoes are viewed as a kind of skin covering. It is the pragmatically (in this case also
semantic) nuclear syllable meaning skin that get the stress. The modifier -foot, is unstressed. It is
the same for i⁶su³, head hair. The word su means fur, hair, or feathers. The hair on our heads is a
type of hair. The modifier ‘head’ describes which kind of hair is being referred to. The syllable
meaning ‘hair’ is stressed and the modifier unstressed.
Stress on loan words from Indonesian keep the stress pattern of Indonesian which have stress on
the next to last syllable.

Stress placement is not only pragmatically determined on the word level, but also on higher
levels eg, word, phrase, clause etc. Stress on lower levels (such as word or phrase) is placed on
the word or syllable that is the pragmatic nucleus of the phrase. The sentence below consisting
of a noun phrase and a verb phrase illustrates this. The words in bold are stressed and have at
least twice the lenth of the syllables in italic. The syllables in italic in turn have twice the length
of the syllables in regular type

theMoodda⁸-i⁷ dy³.
carry-go ImperativeIn the case of higher level structures (such as clause or sentence) extra stress is placed on the
semantic unit that is focus /comment in the clause or sentence.
2.5 Words
Words are the smallest units of speech that can be spoken with meaning in isolation. They are
potentially bounded by pause, and can written bounded by a space. Words in Iau like other
languages are of 5 basic types, nouns (people, places, things, or names), verbs, adverbs,
adjectives, and free standing grammatical particles or markings indicating relationships of
grammatical units with each other.
2.5.1 Phonological Characteristics of Words
As noted at the beginning of this section, words in Iau are identified by potential pause
preceeding or following the word. Words in Iau are mostly monosyllabic with some two syllable
words and a few three syllable words.
Most monosyllablic words (V,VV. VVV. CV, CVV, CVVV, or CVC /VC) are indigenous Iau
words. As nouns, adjectives, adverbs they are single morphemes. But as verbs and sometimes
particles, they are morphemically complex as we shall see below.
2.5.2 Grammatical Characteristics of Words
Iau nouns are unmarked grammatically, or pragmatically.They occur in the beginning and middle
parts of the sentence. They are optionally marked for pragmatic and semantic roles by the be
particle.
Iau adjective are optionally marked for their pragmatic role in defining which item of several
options is being dicussed. They are also marked by the focus particle be⁷ with a tone 7.
Iau adverbs can be marked in some cases also by the particle be with a tone 492.5.3 Multisyllabic Words
Multisyllabic words are often loan words from Indonesian or morphemically complex.. These
two types differ in stress patterns. Indigenous Iau multi morpheme, multisyllable words have
word final stress. This is because stress is pragmatically determined. Stress marks the nuclear
component of the grammatical unit and is manifested by length.
3.0 MORPHEMES AND MORPHOLOGICALLY COMPLEX WORDS
In this section we will discuss morphologically complex words in Iau. We will mainly discuss
verb roots, stems and words as well as nouns and the clitics /affixes(?)
3.1 Verb Roots Stems And Words
3.1.1 Phonological Structure
Iau verbs, even the monosyllabic ones, are morphologically complex structures. A verb stem in
it’s most minimal form consists of a vowel and a tone, but most have a consonant onset. And the
vowel cluster can have up to three vowels. A verb stem may have a single tone or a cluster of
tones. The eight basic tone morphemes, each a composite of 2 different aspectual viewpoints, are
discussed in Bateman, 1986 ‘The tone morphemes and aspect in Iau.’ How the tone meanings
interact with the segmental roots and stems will be discussed in a separate section below. (See
Pawley 1987, 2006 for a non tonal language with complex predicates.)
The following are some examples of Iau verbs consisting only of a vowel root and a tone.

are allowed in complex nuclei in Iau.
3.1.2 Iau Segmental Verb Roots
In an article about Kalam, a Papuan language with a closed set of 90 verbs, Pawley (1987:336338) says these 90 verbs are composed of fewer than 30 verb roots, all having very broad or
abstract meanings. These verb roots are strung together in serial verb constructions to comprise
90% of all verbs occuring in Kalam texts. In Kalam, these strings of generic verbs are used to
indicate lexically complex events such as `hunt', `carry', `send to jail'. There are also many
ongoing studies in Southeast Asia concerning the phenomena7 of “complex verbs”, light or
vector verbs, serial verbs etc.
In Iau, monosyllabic segmental verb stems likewise seem to be composed of strings of consonant
and vowel root morphemes which combine to form stems with broad abstract meanings that are
furthur defined from context, from number of arguments for the predicate in the context, and also
by the aspect of the super-imposed aspect tone morphemes. This is illustrated by Iau verbs
formed with the consonant “b”below.
‘b’ Motion towards and reaching /acting on a goal /location
Some of the Iau verbs built from the root“b” +vowel
ba³ to come (process); to shoot, kill, throw at (a rock at someone)
ba⁹ come
be⁹ to paint
bi³ to arrive
baui³ to arrive at /reach
ba⁶ to come to
da⁸ba⁶ to bring to
bai⁶ beach /dock a canoe
bae⁵(sun /light) shine in on
bu⁵ burn down
bui⁵ cut down (tree)
bo⁵ act of moving to a sitting /squatting position on the ground
boe⁵to lower into a hole, to lower to the ground
Although the individual lexical definitions of these verbs beginning with the consonant ‘b’ vary
widely, note that they all share common spatial and directional motion orientation between the
participants and the action. All the “b” verbs listed above have to do with motion towards a goal
location which results in contact or action on/at that goal-location. The vowels mark various
viewpoints of this action.
For example, in the list above, the verbs be⁹ and ba⁹ /ba³ /ba⁶ all involve a locative relationship
between an object and a goal location, but the vowel ‘e’ has stative qualities. To paint something
involves permanently locating and coating the goal location with the paint. The vowel ‘a’ has a
more generic motion viewpoint, to locate at a place. Both “ba⁹’ and ‘ba³’ involve a moving
object moving towards a goal and locating there. The verb “bi³” is an action that stresses
accomplishment, the total completion of the motion. To have arrived focuses on the completion
of the action of moving towards a goal reaching it and being there. The verb “baui³” to reach a
location is used in travel logs to indicate an intermediate or endpoint goal achieved. The focus is
more on the process of struggle or motion ending in achievement of an intermediate goal to
come/get as far as that location, implying a goal beyond that one, or in some contexts a barely
achieved goal.
The verb ‘ba⁶’ marked with a resultative aspect tone 6 means ‘to have come to’. This is
illustrated more clearly in the compound verb ‘da⁸ba⁶’ to bring s. to a location. The addition of
the more effective action completive viewpoint vowel “i”, forming the verb bai⁶ in a context
where a person is travelling in a canoe, gives the meaning ‘to beach or dock a canoe’ meaning to
Note to myself --See the Rice University (Houston Tx) ‘Eleventh Biennial Symposium:
Intertheoretical Approaches to Complex Verb Constructions’ for many interesting papers on this
topic to apply to Iau at some later date and investigate this topic more thoroughly.)
711put it to shore and tie it up there or to run it aground on the beach. “Bai³ ba⁹” means the sun
comes up. But “Bai³ bae⁵” means the sunshine locates or comes onto something, that is, it shines
in on something.
The list above illustrates how the meaning of the consonants and the vowel(s) interact with the
context and the tone morphemes to indicate which specific meaning should be assigned to the
verb. For example, the verb ba³, ‘to move towards a goal and locate there’ in the context of
hunting or fighting with weapons, means to shoot at and hit something, to kill it. In other
contexts it can mean just to hit as in throwing a rock and hitting the target. However in a more
intransitive context with only a moving object and a location, ‘ba³’ can mean to come (durative
process) as opposed to “ba⁹” come (totality of action, punctual).
The verb ‘bu⁵’ means to burn down. It is a highly effective transitive action, with the agent
totally affecting the undergoer. With the addition of the completive action morpheme “i” and a
telic aspect tone 5, the verb bui⁵ means to cut down /fell a tree. That, is the tree is caused to fall
to the ground/move towards its inevitable and final action endpoint. This is a motion in which
the totally affected undergoer moves to and contacts the goal location, the ground.
The verb ‘bo⁵’ refers to the act of sitting down -usually on the ground or the floor or often in a
squatting position. The person lowers his backside to the floor. (The verb for being seated is a
different verb “b” verb bau⁴de⁹ –a stative verb.) The verb “boe⁵” means to lower something into
a hole, or down to the ground, or to hold out something for someone to see, to demonstrate.
The following charts show the general meanings of Iau consonant and vowel verb roots that
combine to form Iau verb stems.

The monosyllabic consonant and vowel verb roots listed above encode general spatial,
locational, directional and relational viewpoints, static vs dynamic viewpoints and transitivity
viewpoints. As indicated in the list above, most of the vowel roots occur in isolation as verbs.
But consonant roots, of course, do not occur in isolation.
3.1.2.3 Vowel Root Meanings Of The Second Or Third Vowels In The Verb StemWe have seen in section 2.3 on Iau syllable structure that Iau syllable muclei can consist of one,
two or three vowels (V, VV, VVV)
In verb stems with vowel clusters VV or VVV, the second or third vowel marks transitivity, that
is, the degree of effectiveness, the degree of completion of the action, or some limitation on the
action or affectedness of the undergoer
“e” =cause become, become;
“i” indicates totally do the action, effective action;
“y” has to do with a boundary or limitation at a location

The verb roots combine to form segmental verb stems. As we have seen above, each verb stem
has a general abstract meaning which is a combination of the meanings of the consonant and
vowel roots of which it is composed. This is illustrated again by the chart below of some of the
“b” verb stems.

Tone 8
Tone 8 views the proposition or the action as being realized in that immediate time period.
The following example shows the use of a di totally bounded particle to specify a specific
definite time period. The time period “when I was up at Sai⁷ta⁹” (a definite past known event)
defines as situation when a simultaneous action took place.

The action marked by be⁸ in the example below, a person hitting his head against the wall, is the
cause of irritation to another person in the house who has just asked what was that noise? The
action is now in the past but still part of the immediate situation and discussion. So it is marked

8.2.2 Tone Sequences
In addition to the eight basic levels and contours, there are 4 combinations of 2 tone sequences
that commonly occur on single syllables, The sequences ⁷⁻⁸ and ⁴⁻⁷ are the most common
sequences on verbs, adjectives and particles. The following are some examples.
da⁸⁻⁴ mountain.
sae⁶⁻⁴ machete
Baui⁷⁻⁸(be⁷) three (Note ⁷⁻⁸ is a tonal variant of ⁷⁻³.)
bui⁴⁻⁷ (se⁵) will cut down (intention marking particle)
The ⁴⁻⁷ sequence which occurs on telic verbs when combined with an intention indicating particle
is very common and easily elicited.
Au⁷ u⁸ bui⁴⁻⁷ se⁵
He is going/intending to cut down a tree
The ⁷⁻⁸ sequences occurs on particles, adjectives and verbs except in certain rare occurances on
some verbs, it can also be easily elicited.

And so his wife later gave birth to a boy child.
Y⁸ su⁴ fe⁷⁻⁸
we die lest/might
We might die./Lest we die (contradesiderative)
There are other tone sequences that occasionally show up on verbs expressing aspectual nuances
that are extremely contextual and speaker perspective oriented. These occur in natural text but
are difficult to elicit.
Sui -3

baui⁸⁻⁵ to finally reach ones destination. (⁸⁻⁴ tone substitution morpheme in linking
dependent clauses)
bv⁸ ba⁶⁻³ to come to/arrive at (⁶⁻⁸ and ⁶⁻⁴ tone substitution morphemes in subordinate and
linking clauses)72.3 Syllable Structure
Iau is basically a monosyllabic language. The syllable structure allows complex syllable nuclei
of up to 3 vowels. There are no consonant clusters and only one type of closed syllable ending in
an unreleased [p]with very limited distribution.

CVC
The eight Iau vowels a,i,i-,y,e,u,v,o are distributed in VV complex vowel nuclei as follows:
V1V²ai-iyeuvai-aiayaeauavuuivvyooeNote that in the first vowel slot of VV nuclei, only a, and one of the back vowels u, v and o
occur. In the second vowel slot i-, i, y, e occur. The back vowel u and v also occurThe vowels a
and o do not occur as V².
There are only two types of VVV nuclei allowed, the sequence aui and the sequence avy as
shown below.

"9.1.1 Yes-No Questions in Iau
Yes-no questions are formed in Iau by adding a yes-no question marker be or ba, which can be
used interchangeably, and by changing the tone on the verb stem according to the verb class
requirements.. In the example below, the first sentence is a simple statement. The second
sentence is a yes-no question formed from this statement.
1.Au⁷ du⁹
bv⁸ i⁹.
he wild pig for go
He went hunting. (Lit. He went to get a wild pig.)
2.Au⁷ du⁹
bv⁸ i⁷ ba³?
he wild pig for go ?-Uncertain
Did he go hunting?
The bolded words in the second sentence above illustrate the changes used in Iau to form a yesno question. The question marker ba³ is added to indicate that the speaker thinks it is true that the
man has gone hunting, but he is not sure. The example above also illustrates how the tone is
changed on tone 9 verbs in yes-no questions. A tone 9 (high level tone) is changed to a tone 7
(high rising tone). In the sentences above i⁹ becomes i⁷.
The following pairs of sentences show the tone changes for tone 3 verbs and tone 5 verbs. The
tone 3, low falling tone, is changed to a tone 8, low level tone. A tone 5 high low falling tone is
changed to a tone 4 high falling verb in the question form.
1. Tone 3 change to tone 8
Au⁷ fv⁷ da⁸ du³.
he plane carry go along
He flies the plane.
Au⁷ fv⁷
da⁸ du⁸
ba³?
he plane carry go along ?-Uncertain
Does he fly the plane?
2. Tone 5 change to tone 4
Au⁷ a⁷se⁹ ty⁷
foi⁵.
he SqMk person tell
He told them.
Au⁷ a⁷se⁹ ty⁷
foi⁴ ba³?
he SqMk person tell ?-Uncertain
Has he already told them?
The other tones on verbs, 6, 2, and 8 do not change when a yes-no question marker is added.
Different tones are used on the sentence final question marker to show different degrees of
uncertainty on the part of the speaker. There are three different tones that can occur on a be yesno question marker. A tone 3 indicates that the speaker thinks the information in the question is110correct but he is not sure. All the previous examples in this section have had a tone 3 on the
question marker.
A tone 9 on the question marker means the speaker thinks the information in the question is
correct and doesn't expect the hearer to correct him. However, he does want the hearer to answer
him. This kind of question can occur in an interview or a teaching situation where the speaker is
trying to get the hearer to give him a yes answer. The following question is an example.
Dy⁴be⁷ a⁴ a⁷se⁹
ui⁸ bv⁸ tv⁹
be⁹?
then father already house to go away ?-Certain
So then, father went home?
The speaker in the example above knows that father has gone home but he wants the hearer to
say it.
A tone 4 on the question marker means that the speaker is not at all sure that the information in
his question is correct. He thinks it is highly likely that the speker will correct him. The
following sentence is an example of tone 4 on a question marker.
Da⁹ a² tv⁹ be⁴?
you pl land-by go away ?-Vuncertain
I guess you traveled by land?
In the question above the speaker has never been to the place they are talking about so he is just
guessing. This is indicated by the tone 4 marker be⁴.
9.2 Iau Content Questions
Content questions are used to obtain unknown information as illustrated in the following
dialogues.
Du
-i⁸ da -e⁹

He what happened when wild pig –by bite? Dog carry go when wild pig-by bite.
What was he doing when he got attacked by pig? (be⁸du⁷ interruption in expected flow of
event)? He was taking his dog out hunting when he was attacked by a pig.
Note that in the examples above, most of the information in the clause is already known /given.
The unknown item indicated by the question becomes the focus, that is the new predicated
information about the topicwhich is the given part of the clause.
The following is a list of content question words in Iau.

/what do you say /call –(person/thing)- ?
In general, te⁸ means `what' or `where', ty⁷⁻⁸ means `who' and to⁴ refers to questions about events
‘what happened?’. The other syllables on the end of the question words are various noun and
verb markers which identify the function of the word in the sentence as well as it’s focus status..
Each of the types of question words will be discussed below.","[110, 111]"
"54Di⁹ te⁸be⁷ ui⁷⁻⁸

2S where stand-TOT.INC.CHS Req-RS.SA
Where do you want to stand?
The first sentence is an example of a request for permission to do something. The second
sentence is from a conversation in which one person has asked another person if he would take
his picture for him. The second sentence is a request for the hearer to indicate to the speaker
what he wants to do.
The dy particle marks imperatives in Iau as illustrated by the following example.
I⁷
dy³.
go-TOT.INC Imp-RS.SA
Go!
The particle ‘dy⁸da⁹’ occurs most frequently in contexts of parents talking to their children when
they are trying to coax the child to do something. The particle dy⁸da⁹ has the meaning `I said to
do it'. The following is an example.
Ba⁷
dy⁸ -da⁹.
come-TOT.INC EImp-NRS.SA
It’s a given fact/you know (you) must come! /I said, come!
The particle day³ marks prohibitions as illustrated in the following sentence.
Di⁹ dy⁴sy⁹ i⁷
day³.
1S Proh go-TOT.INC Prohib-RS.SA
You shouldn't go. /Don't go!.
Prohibitions require both the dy⁴sy⁷ and day³ particles.
The Mood Tone Morphemes
The illocutionary force of an utterance can be defined as the speech act that is performed by
uttering a given proposition. Lyons (1977:745) lists statements, commands and questions as
examples of utterances with differing illocutionary force. The illocutionary force of an utterance
in Iau is indicated by a combination of grammatical devices including modality particles,
sentence final segmental mood particles and the tone morphemes that occur on them.
We have seen in the previous section that the Iau segmental mood particles indicate the intended
illocutionary force of the proposition. One set of particles marks sentences that give information
to the hearer. Another set of particles marks sentences whose role is to elicit a response from the
hearer.
The tone morphemes which are superimposed on these segmental particles mark the dynamics
of the interchange between speaker and hearer. The tone morphemes indicate whether the
speaker is asserting the information as nuclear /core information about the discourse topic or not.
They also indicate which speaker in the conversation is controlling the discourse topic and the
flow of information about discourse topic. The tone morphemes on Iau mood particles have
differing meanings depending on the illocutionary force of the sentence on which they occur. In
the following sections we will discuss the meanings of the tone morphemes on Yes-No Question
Markers. Then we will discuss the meanings of the tone morphemes on directives. And finally
we will discuss the meanings of the tone morphemes on statements.
The tone morphemes on the mood particles indicate the illocutionary force of the utterance, ie
how much response the speaker expects from the hearer and how forceful and immediate the
requirement is.
The following lists the illocutionary force meanings of the tone morphemes on these particles.
3 =Assertive, expects response /or responding to previous speaker (RsA)
8 =Assertive, expects /needs immediate response (IRsA)
9 =Assertive, but does not expect response (NRsA)
5 =Assertive, but expects hearer resistance, both hearer and
speaker obligation (SHRsA)
4 =Non-assertive, but expects response (RsNA)
7 =Non-assertive, does not expect response or compliance (NRsNA)
The following are some examples..","[54, 55]"
"36The tone morphemes on the stative particle ‘de’ could be viewed as aspectual viewpoints, limited
to totality of action, punctual (9) , totality of action incompletive (7), and resultative durative (8).
But they are also compatible if viewed has having epistemic meanings as on the other postverbal particles.

he house-in lying down Sta Tot.Inc but

He was lying in the house but we called him anyway.
In the first sentence the man’s lying down is viewed as an static situation. The perfective aspect
viewpoint indicates that the static situation is being viewed as a unit occurance.
In the second sentence, the man’s siesta is interrupted in the next clause, it was incomplete,
interrupted by the following event and so is marked with a totality of action incompletive aspect.

3.1.3.2 Grammatical Aspect and the Iau Tone Morphemes
Grammatical aspect is used to show the relationship of actions and states to time and to the
other events in the context. Grammatical aspect signals the temporal viewpoint of the event such
as punctual/perfective (as single unit), durative/imperfective (occurs over extended period of
time, overlapping, repetitive, gnomic or generic truth statements and the like) as well as various19temporal aspects of the event like inceptive, incompletive /interrupted etc. Grammatical aspect
is governed by the grammatical context.

74Punctual aspect sees the action simply as something that happens or has happened. This is the
aspect used most often in chains of actions related by cause-effect or chronological sequence.
Each action is seen as a unit or point in time or on an eventline. It other kinds of discourse it is
used on statements of fact and assertions. The three punctual aspects are totality of action,
resultative events and telic events. Punctual-Totality of Action viewpoint aspect is often referred
to as PERFECTIVE aspect.
Durative aspect sees the event as a process or extended action occurring over time. The
linguistic terms progressive, continuative, durative, and repetitive /iterative all refer to actions
occuring over an extended period of time, often overlapping with other events and occuring
multiple times, but number and time of occurrence is indefinite. The three durative aspects are
totality of action, resultative events and telic processes and events. Durative aspect verbs are
often referred to as IMPERFECTIVE verbs.
Incompletive aspectual viewpoints view the action as incomplete in some way. Inceptive
viewpoints view the action as just beginning (began to, started to). Incompletive verbs can
include interrputed, or postponed actions. Or they can have no definite ending.
In Iau events that are planned, but not yet executed, about to begin but not yet, also have an
incompletive aspectual viewpoint as well as discussions of events as possible or probable. Using
incompletive aspect the Iau can discuss hypothetical events as well. These events are irrealis
(never happened) but are being viewed as if they had happened or will happen. There are only
two incompletive aspects in Iau, totality of action and telic action.

3.1.3.3 Tone Classes And Their Grammatical Variants
Sections 3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.2 dealt with the issues of semantic aspect viewpoints of an event
realized in the languages lexicon and grammatical aspect in Iau. As stated in the opening to
3.1.3.1, another way of looking at the Iau aspect tone morphemes is to use the tone morphemes
to divide Iau verbs into lexical classes. This would divide Iau verbs into tone classes.
In the tone aspect morpheme chart below, there are four of the basic aspects that often result in
different lexical meanings.","[19, 20]"
"16The following examples illustrate the differences between totality of action, resultative and telic
viewpoints.
TOTALITY OF ACTION

""The people now coming in a motor boat."" ""Which people is it that are coming back here?"" ""It's
the people that just recently went away to Do that are coming /arriving, of course.""
The punctual telic tone morpheme views the event of coming to a location as the completion of a
cycle so to speak. It can be glossed as come back/return, come back to one’s starting point. In
other contexts like the slow small oozing of blood from a wound, the blood comes out but stays
in that spot.
In the telic verb ‘come’ the endpoint location of the event come is fixed Also it is the same as the
beginning point. The telic durative aspect of come is glossed as attach to /adhere to.
The aspect tones illustrated above are made up of both lexical and grammatical aspect
parameters.The three aspectual viewpoints that heavily influence lexical meaning of the verb as
well as indicating degree of transitivity of the action represented by the verb stem are located
along the left side of the chart below.These are the totality of action, resultative, and telic
viewpoints. These will be discussed under lexical aspect below. The three grammatical aspectual
viewpoints in Iau are located across the top of the chart below. These are perfective/punctual,
imperfective /durative, and incompletive. The grammatical viewpoints will be discussed in
3.1.3.2 below.
PunctualDurativeIncompletiveTotality Of Action⁹³⁷Resultative⁶⁸Telic⁵²⁴3.1.3.1 Lexical Aspect And The Iau Tone Morphemes17Verbs are about events. There are inherently different types of events in the world. Some events
like boil /bring to a boil, or the rising and setting of the sun are inherent processes. Some like the
verb “run” inherently continue over time. Some events are processes with inherent endpoints,
like a tree falling to the ground. Some events like go, or come, are spoken of and viewed in their
totality, without focussing on any one part of the event. In many languages this information is
mostly implicit in the lexical meaning of the verb. In Iau, however, much of this type of
information is not indicated by the lexical form of the verb but by a combination of context and
tone morpheme aspect.
The chart below gives various examples of sets of verbs having the same segmental stem and
different lexical meanings..

"118A i⁷
bv³.
I go TOT.INC Rq Permission
Is it okay if I go?
The first two requests are marked with the statement particle y which in Iau indicates that the
speaker is giving the information to the hearer. The first request is a stronger request than the
second request. That is, the speaker puts more pressure on the hearer to comply. This is indicated
by the obligation particle sy `should' and by the tone on the declarative particle y in (1). The tone
3 on the y particle indicates that the speaker is not presuming to control the conversation or the
hearer, but he is asserting his utterance as important in the conversation.
The second request has no obligation particle and no overt command particle. It is a statement
that conveys the speakers opinion or evaluation of the topic under discussion. The verb stem tone
does not change in this type of request. The tone 4 morpheme on the declarative particle not only
indicates that the speaker is not trying to control the conversation or the hearer, but it also
indicates that the speaker feels it is highly likely that the hearer will be unwilling to accept his
statement.
The third type of request is marked by the bv³ particle which means that the speaker is
requesting the hearer to tell him what to do. When the bv³ particle is used as a request, it is the
hearer who is controlling and directing what should be done.
9.4 Suggestions
The particle ba⁵ is used in Iau to mark suggestions or cohortatives where the speaker is saying to
the hearer `Let's ...'. The following is an example.
Y⁸ sa⁴dy⁴ ui⁸
bv⁸ i⁷
ba⁵.
1p UrgeAct house to go-TOT.INC Suggest
Like commands, the verbs in suggestions marked by ba⁵ undergo a change of tone. Tone 7 is
substituted for tone 9, tone 8 is substituted for tone 3, and tone 4 is substituted for tone 5.
9.5 Wishes and Desires
Wishes and desires in Iau are statements that the speaker makes informing the hearer of his
desire. The speaker would like the hearer to fulfill his desire but puts no oligation on him. There
are two different forms that Iau speakers use to express desire. These are illustrated below.
1. A⁹ da⁸bu⁸ sa⁸

y³.
1s book see-TOT.INC Inten but

I intend to look at books but maybe it won't happen. (ie you may not be willing to let me)
The first example above uses the particle fo which means `to want to' to express desire. The tone
9 on the final particle y⁹ indicates that the speaker is using his statement to control the
conversation and the hearer with his statement. That is he wants to talk to the hearer about his
desire for squash and he wants the hearer to help him fulfull his desire.
The second example is an example of a statement of desire which is used in a situation where the
speaker feels the hearer may not be willing to fulfill his desire.
9.6 Reporting Exciting Action
In Iau there is a special particle a⁹sy⁴ which is used when the speaker wants to call the hearer's
attention to something he feels is of interest or of importance to him. The following sentence is
an example.
Bv⁸ku⁷ du⁷sy⁹ doe⁷ a⁹ sy⁴!
book your see-TOT.INC Report
You should notice/be noticing your book!
The sentence above is used in a situation where the speaker sees or knows that something has
happened to the hearer's book. The speaker is calling the hearer's attention to it thinking the
hearer may want to take action on it.","[118, 119]"

As illustrated in 1 above, a⁷se⁹ +u⁶ means prior to previous event. a⁷se⁹ +be³di⁹ is used to mark a
new segment of the eventline, as either a new course of action or a new participant as illustrated
in 2 and 3 above.
As shown in the previous set of examples, a⁷se⁹ +0 indicates that the events in the marked
clauses are part of the narrative eventline. In narrative, as a spacer and marker of the left
dislocated position, a⁷se⁹ also has specialized participant activating functions and specialized
functions in marking setting frameworks.
6.2. The pragmatic structure of Iau clauses
The information structure of a clause is divided into two parts, focus/comment and topic. Focus
or comment is the part of the clause which is being asserted (Lambrecht 1987) See also Dooley
and Meyer, 1993 . Focus either adds new information or modifies an already activated
propositional framework. Topic is the part of the clause which is pragmatically presupposed.
6.2.1 Topic-Focus/Comment
The information structure of a clause is divided into two parts, focus and topic. Focus or
comment is the part of the clause which is being asserted (Lambrecht 1987). It can also be
defined as `the part of an utterance intended to make a change in the mental representation of the
hearer' (Dooley and Levinsohn 1993). Focus either adds new information or modifies an already
activated propositional framework. Topic is the part of the clause which is pragmatically
presupposed. The predicate focus structure, most often called a topic comment structure,
represents the unmarked information structure of the clause. The following are examples of
predicate focus structure in Iau
Topic

da⁸su⁶ i⁷ se⁵.
we
tomorrow go intend
We will go tomorrow.
Topic
Comment /Predicate Focus
Da⁷
y⁸ di⁸ ae⁹ y³.
dog
we kill Neg Smnt
We didn't kill the dog.
In an unmarked information structure, the verb and it's arguments are being asserted about a
topical noun /noun phrase. The verb phrase is the head of the focus structure and is located in the
comment part of the clause. In an unmarked predicate focus clause in Iau, nouns are unmarked.","[84, 85]"
"124The tones on the statement particles in Iau indicate which participant, the speaker or the hearer is
controlling the topic of the conversation and also whether the information in the statement is
about the topic or not. The most commonly used tones on the statement particles are tones 9,3
and 4.
10.1.1 Tone 9: Speaker Controlling
A tone 9 on a statement particle indicates that the speaker is using the information in the
statement to control the conversation or offer contrastive information. The following is an
example.
A. Dy⁴ so⁶ to⁷ ba⁷
-de⁹?
then child how many Sta-FACT
And how many children does he have?
B. So⁶ ai⁶
y⁹.
child Neg-RES.DUR Info-SC.A.DT
He has no children.
In the statement above, the speaker uses a tone 9 on the y statement/answer marking particle to
indicate that he is offering contrastive information in his answer to the hearer. The first speaker
thinks the person being talked about has children. The second speaker responds with the
contrastive information that he doesn't have any children. The following is another example.
Ay⁸. Au⁷sy⁹ ai⁷bv⁹ fi⁴be⁸ dy⁴dau⁸ de⁷

so that-TOT.PUN D.UBd-FACT Info-SC.A.DT
I see. When our (girls) are like she is (the same age), then (it’s not that way). They are
quickly /soon married to a husband.
The statement above is taken from a conversation about a girl of marriageable age. After hearing
about the customs of the hearer's language group, the speaker uses the statement above to offer
information about a contrastive culture in which girls marry at an earlier age. The tone 9
indicates that the speaker is using the statement to offer contrastive information about the topic.
10.1.2 Tone 3: Speaker Responding
A tone 3 on a statement particle indicates that the speaker is not trying to control the information
about the topic. The tone 3 occurs frequently on answers to questions. The speaker uses the tone
3 to indicate that he is not trying to control the conversation but is responding with the requested
information. The use of a tone 3 also indicates that the information in the statement is about the
topic. The following sentence is an example.
A. Fv⁷
da⁸su⁶
ba⁷
ba³?

Is the plane coming tomorrow?
B. Di⁹y³. Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶ ba⁹ a⁹
y³
yes plane tomorrow come-TOT.PUN DUbd-FACT Info-SNC.A.DT
Yes, the plane is coming tomorrow.
In the example above, the second speaker marks his answer to the question with a tone 3 to
indicate that it is a response to the first speaker's lead.
A tone 3 is also used on statement particles to mark additional comments that a speaker may
want to make on an already introduced topic. The following statement is an example.
Ay⁸ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ fv⁷ doe⁷

The statement above is an excerpt from a conversation about riding in a plane for the first time.
The speaker is offering the statement above as an additional comment on the topic of how
Benjamin reacted to the plane ride.","[124, 125]"
"89The first sentence in the set introduces the lizard in a clause level LDP and then refers to it
within the clause with a NP having a zeroed head. The second sentence show a more unmarked
way of introducing a lower level participant within the clause itself ‘a lizard’.
Participants introduced with LDP’s occur in narrative settings, while clauses unmarked mention
within the clause occurs most frequently within the narrative eventline or at subunit settings in
the narrative.
If LPD's are indeed broad sentence focus structures, then the spacers can be interpreted by
implication as participant activators. We have seen how predicate focus can be shifted in Iau by
two mechanisms. by adding presentational LDP's to a clause and by marking NP's within the
clause core as focus head with the be marker.
Cleft constructions or Narrow Focus Structures as focus structures in IauThe following is an example of another focus structure.
Bv⁷ te⁸ de⁹? Bv⁷ da⁷ du⁷be⁷ di⁹ sa³.
this what Sta this dog NFocus food eat
(Looking at pictures.)What is this? This is a dog that is eating food.
In the example above, a noun, `dog' is focus, or what the speaker is asserting about the topic. The
narrow focus marker du⁷be⁷ follows the focus noun to form an LDP and is followed by a pause.
The predicate that follows is not being asserted about the discourse topic.
Another example,
a Da⁹ kei⁹ davy⁷ se⁵

tay and so trees that c. if you are going to make a wooden dish
then d. it's only those two that you should cut down e. and cutting
them in pieces and splitting (the pieces), f. make them like a
wooden dish.
The example above is taken from a procedural text. The cleft construction /narrow focus marker
by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ marks the two kinds of wood as being the main thing the speaker is asserting about
the topic, making a wooden dish. The narrow focus marker by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ is a more emphatic
form of the narrow focus marker du⁷be⁷. The examples above represent the reverse of the topic comment clause structure. In the examples above, the LDP is focus and the remainder of the
clause is presupposition. The tone on the narrow focus markers varies with the relationship
between the focus noun and the presupposition predicate. A narrow focus marker with a tone 4,
du⁷be⁴, is used to indicate a means relationship between focus information and the information in
the clause.
This is illustrated in the clause below.
a. Dy⁸ to⁴

a. ""And how /by what means does it (the vine) go (climb up high)?""
b. ""It's by going along the surface of the tree that it goes.""
c. ""When it goes along the surface of the tree it's then when.
d. it gets to the top, e. then what happens to it again? (Answer: it
falls back down because it has no support)
The example above also illustrates a clause as LDP narrow focus instead of a noun. (""When it
goes along the surface of the tree it's then when).
This illustrates that the force of the Iau narrow focus marker is to mark only one element of the
information structure as being asserted about the topic, in contrast to predicate focus in which the
entire predicate verb and associated information is being asserted.
The be focus markerThe be focus head marker can occur within the clause in a narrow focus construction as
illustrated by the following examples.

We have seen previously that the be marker marks nouns as focus head of the clause structure in
topic -comment constructions. The examples above illustrate the be marker as also marking a
head within in the clause structure of the focus -presupposition construction. In a focus presupposition construction, the LDP is focus and the remainder of the clause is presupposition.
In the examples above the be marker marks the discourse topical nouns as head of the
presupposition structure and as what the LDP focus noun is about. As in the topic -comment
clauses where a noun is information head of the comment, the verb provides additional
information about the relationship between LDP focus and the marked noun presupposition
heads.","[89, 90, 91]"
"92The topic of this portion of the conversation is the teacher's garden. The speaker wants the
hearers to work on it after school. The sentence above consists of three clauses. The first two
clauses have only one participant, Y⁸ `we'. The final clause in the sentence has two participants
y⁸ `we' and a⁵ ku⁸du⁸ be⁸sy⁹ `the teacher's garden'. Since the noun phrase `the teachers garden' is
what the sentence is about, it must preceed the pronoun y⁸ `we'.
6.3.3 Order in focus- presupposition clauses.
As we have also seen above, focus presupposition clauses in the form of cleft constructions are
also common in Iau (It was the dog that…). In these kinds of sentences, the word order is
reversed. The new predicated information is placed on the left side of the clause, the already
given /known /topical information is placed to the right as shown below.
New Predicated Info

Subj

da⁸ tv
-9?
cassowary it was that Benjamin PredInfo -Ag dog for carry go away -Tot.Punc
It was cassowary that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for.
In the example above the given known topical information is that someone took a dog out
hunting. The statement above identifies what they were hunting, the main new information and
who was the agent. The topical information is placed on the right, the new information is placed
on the left. The identity of the agent is known but important to be specified so it is placed in the
middle position, partially predicated but also known information.
6.5 Clauses, The Building Blocks Of Sentences.
Clauses are primarily the building blocks that form sentences. They can be embedded within
other clauses in noun slots as nominalized clauses in order to describe or identify participants in
terms of events. They can also form complex sentences by being embedded in temporal
adverbial slots in the form of dependent clauses. Or as independent with no embedded temporal
adverbial clauses, clauses can combine with each other in additive relationships to form
compound sentences. (See the section on sentence types below)
So, clauses in Iau can be classified into 4 types according how they are used in other sentences
and clauses. These four types are independent clauses, medial clauses, subordinate and
nominalized clauses. The following section of a narrative text consisting of one long sentence
(which is very common in Iau narrative) illustrates all four types of Iau clauses. In the example
below, nominalized clauses are on the far left margin, independent clauses next, medial verbs
next and subordinate clauses the most indented.

didn’t give me any, I slept. (/I went to sleep without her giving me any). And then in the
night I woke up and then I secretly got up to get mother’s sago……
These four Iau clause types contrast in their distribution within sentences, permitted verb stem
tones, and in types of conjunctions. Each of these clause types will be illustrated and discussed
below.
6.3.1 Independent Clauses
Iau independent clauses are characterized by the following structural features. They allow the
full range of aspect tone morphemes on the verb and the full range of postverbal particles,
including the illocutionary force marking particles. Independent clauses in Iau are not marked by
an obligatory conjunction or clause marker. The following sentences illustrate these features.
A⁹ y⁷
bv⁸ i⁷

I am going to get water.a⁹
MUbd-FACTy⁹.
StatemtUi⁸
fi⁸
fe⁷be⁴ da⁸dv⁹
y⁸ bi⁸ sa³.
house
thatch bad
MVClCj
we rain eat-Tot.Dur
The roof thatch was bad and so, we got wet from the rain.
The first example above illustrates an independent clause with a clause final illocutionary force
statement marker ‘y’ and a preceeding status marker ‘a’. The sentence stress falls on the clause
final illocutionary force marker. The second example consists of two clauses. The second clause
in bold is the independent clause. The tone 3 aspect morpheme on the verb sa³ does not occur on
medial verb clauses but is allowed on verbs in independent clauses. Sentence stress is located on
the verb sa³ in the final independent clause.
The first example above also illustrates another factor which distinguishes independent clauses
from the other clause types in Iau. Independent clauses have a distinct grammatical function
from the other clause types. Independent clauses function as the nuclear components of
sentences. That is, an independent clause in itself can also be a simple sentence. The other clause
types by themselves do not form complete sentences but must occur in combination with an
independent clause.
6.3.2 Medial Verb Clauses
Medial verbs are a class of verbs characteristic of the non Austronesian languages of Papua,
Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Medial verbs in these languages do not carry the full tense,
aspect, and mood information marked on independent verbs. They are frequently used to form
sentences with long strings of dependent clauses ending in a final independent clause. Many
languages with medial verbs are also characterized by switch reference marking systems in
which a marker on the medial verb indicates whether its subject is the same subject or a different
subject than the subject of the main clause or a subsequent clause. No evidence of this kind of
system has been found in Iau.
Medial verb clauses in Iau are also characterized by an obligatory 2 syllable clitic conjunction
which occurs clause final and marks dependent relationships such as temporal sequence, reason,
grounds, adversative, temporal margins, prerequisite events and chains of events as illustrated
below.","[92, 93, 94]"

In each of the examples above, the noun phrase or noun phrases in bold give additional
information about the identity of the noun in the first noun phrase.
5.2.3 Distribution of Iau noun phrases in the clause and sentence
The chart at the beginning of this sectio, laid out so neat and orderly, can be misleading. When I
first started studying Iau and encountered sentences like the one below, I starting thinking Iau
had “split” noun phrases.
Du⁹
a⁷se⁹
bo⁴be⁷ v³
fe⁶.
wild pig SeqMkr two-adj coming-to-ref. pt appeared
Wild pigs,( introduce ptrc/Mrk Chron Seq) two (of them) came into view/appeared.
The head noun and it’s descriptive quantifier are separated by what Dooley9 calls a “spacer
particle” This is a clause level particle that separates a left located topic slot from the clause
proper. What looks like a split noun phrase is the head noun, being marked as clause or sentence
topic. Then this head noun, having been already unambiguously mentioned as topic, is zeroed in
the clause proper. Only the modifying adjective occurs marking the noun phrase location in the
clause. The spacer particle slot will be discussed furthur in the section 6 on layered clauses and
is also pertinent to narrative discourse study because a⁷se⁹ marks participants as thematic and is
often used in narrative settings. It also functions to mark the events predicated in the clause as
part of a chronological sequence of event.
5.2.4 Joining Nouns in Iau
Two or more nouns in Iau can be joined either directly by juxtaposition, or by use of one of the
three Iau noun conjunctions, bv⁸ke⁷ `also', be⁷⁻⁸de³ `and' (Complete list), and da⁸ba³ /da⁷ba³
`and' (Representative list). The following are some examples.

Example (1) above illustrates two nouns joined without a conjunction. Examples (2) through (4)
illustrate the use of each of the three noun conjunctions in Iau. The conjunctions follow the noun
they mark indicating that it is joined to another noun in the context. In the examples above, each
noun in the list of conjoined nouns is marked with a conjunction. However, it is not obligatory in

Some may be marked and others unmarked.
5.2.5 DISCOURSE: The Significance Of Noun Conjunctions In Iau Discourse
The choice of noun conjunction and the choice of whether a noun is marked by a conjunction at
all is determined by the relationships of the participants to the action and to each other in
performing the action. In general, nouns are simply juxtaposed and not marked by a conjunction,
when both nouns are participants that are major participants in the action and the discourse
context. The following example is the first sentence of an Iau short story which introduces the
participants as major participants using juxtaposed nouns. Note that since the speaker as
participant is obvious, being implicitly included in “we”, he does not mention himself again –
only the two other unintroduced participants.
Y⁸ baui⁷⁻⁸ A⁸de⁸a⁸ Ye⁷bi⁹ y⁸
we three
Adea Jimmy we
We three, Adea and Jimmy, we ...
Nouns that are all marked by conjunctions are usually not major participants or props in the
discourse and do not participate equally in the action. The following is an example.
Kaf⁷
bowbe⁷⁻⁸de³ si⁷
be⁷⁻⁸de³ da⁷ be⁷⁻⁸de³
and
net bag and
dog anda⁷se⁹
o⁹
Seq Mkr
take-TOT.PUN
He got his bow, string bag and dog.
The example above is from a portion of narrative in which the man is going to have to flee from
the village since he just murdered someone. The items marked by the conjunction be⁷⁻⁸de³ in the
example above have no major role in the narrative. They represent the usual things that a man
takes with him when he goes leaves the village for a jungle stay
When one noun is marked by a conjunction and the other is not, the unmarked noun has the
major role in the performance of the action or is the more topical participant in the narrative. The
following is an example.
A⁹ a⁷se⁹
Ti⁸bo⁸ti⁷vs³ bv⁸ke⁷ be³ta⁹ du³.
I SeqMkr Timotius
also
village walk -TOT.DUR
I was walking around the village with Timotius.
The example above is the opening line of an Iau short story. The story is about how the speaker
tricked Timotius as they were walking around the village. Timotius is marked by the noun
conjunction bv⁸ke⁷ as a less topical participant.
The noun conjunction bv⁸ke⁷ as illustrated in the previous example is used in Iau to mark
accompaniment and is best translated by the English glosses `with', `along with', or `also'. Nouns
marked by bv⁸ke⁷ usually have a minor role compared with unmarked nouns. In contrast, nouns
marked with the Iau noun conjunction be⁷⁻⁸de³ have a more topical role in the narrative. This is
illustrated by the following example.
Av⁸si⁷ be⁷⁻⁸de³ Ti⁸bo⁸ti⁷vs³ be⁷⁻⁸de³ a⁴
bv⁸ke⁷ tv⁹ bv⁸ i⁹.
Ausi
and
Timotius
and
father also
sago
for go-TOT.PUN
Ausi and Timotius along with father went to get sago.
The example above is taken from a narrative about how the speaker and his friend ambush Ausi
and Timotius as a joke while they are in the jungle getting sago. Ausi and Timotius are less
topical participants than the speaker and his friend so they are marked by the conjunction
be⁷⁻⁸de³. The speaker's father is the least topical participant since he being an adult was not69involved in ambush. The speaker's father is marked by the noun conjunction bv⁸ke⁷ to indicate
his nontopical role in the action.
The Iau noun conjunction da⁸ba³ /da⁷ba³ is used when the nouns in the list are a representative
listing, ie they represent the kinds of items or people who participated in the action but not
necessarily all the actual participants.
The following is an example.
Dy⁸ a⁴

go ahead and
come threaten-TEL.PUN
So then, any other fathers he has (ie father's brother's) come and threaten him. If he has any
uncles (ie mother's brothers), then they come over and threaten him.
The example above is taken from a scene in an Iau narrative in which a murderer has returned to
his village after a long absence. The relatives of the murdered boy confront him and threaten to
shoot him in retaliation. In the narrative above, the speaker is telling the hearer the kinds of
relatives that might threaten to kill the murderer if they happened to be present at the time the
murderer returned. He marks the noun phrase `other fathers' with the noun conjunction da⁸ba³ to
indicate that this is representative of the kind of relative that opposed the murderer when he
showed up again.
6.0 LAYERED CLAUSE STRUCTURE: NUCLEUS, CORE, PERIPHERY
Words and particles combine to form phrases. Words and phrases combine to form clauses.
Clauses like phrases have language specific structure.
Clauses in various languages are sometimes classified on the basis of verb types such as stative,
equative, intransitive, transitive and bitransitive. The classification of Iau clauses on the basis of
verb types, is not a very helpful classification, since Iau verb stems do not have inherent lexical
transitivity. The following are some examples of clauses varying in transitivity but using the
same verb.
BE =be in or on a place

As illustrated above, the modality post-verbal particles have intention, desiderative and
inabilitative meanings. The tones that occur on these particles, have status meanings. Status
deals with the reality or factuality of the situation. .
The following chart shows the 8 tone morphemes and their status meanings. These same status
morphemes also occur on stative particles and on some of the peripheral operators. See Bateman,
1986 in Nusa for more information and examples of these status particlesEstablish as

Nouns and obligation modals preceed the clause nucleus in Iau. Each will be discussed below.
Core Nouns.
The following are some examples of nouns in the Iau clause core. The nouns are in bold.

16. Au⁷
tv⁹ e⁹ ti⁴ to⁹.
he
sago me give CntraExpct
But he gave me sago! /or Contrary to what you think, he gave me
sago!
As illustrated above, Iau is an verb final language, The nouns in the clause core preceed the
clause nucleus. Examples 14 and 15 also show that ordering of nouns in the clause is not
determined by semantic role. In example 14 the order of the nouns is Agent followed by
Undergoer. In example 15, the order is Undergoer followed by agent. In example 14, the agent `I'
is also the clause topic, or what the clause is about (Dik 1978). But in example 15, the undergoer,
`sago' is the clause topic.
Examples 14 and 15 illustrate that ordering of nouns in Iau clauses is pragmatically determined.
Regarding the ordering of NP’s, the more topical nouns are placed to the left of less topical
nouns.
Examples 14 and 15 differ in another way. In 14, the unmarked pronoun form a⁹ for first person
singular is used. In 15, when 1st person singular agent is not clause topic, the marked pronoun
form bv⁶ is used. This illustrates that the unmarked expectation in an Iau clause is that agent will
also be topic. If not, and if the agent is first person singular pronoun, it must be marked as nontopical agent. None of the other pronouns have a separate form for non-topical agent.
As also illustrated above, Iau nouns and pronouns are normally unmarked for semantic role.
Under certain discourse conditions, nouns in Iau are marked for semantic case roles. This will be
discussed in Section *.
Iau is a pro-drop language with no verb agreement. The following portion of a procedural text
(See 3.7 for full text), illustrates the pro-drop phenomena in Iau. The clauses illustrating prodrop
are in bold in the text.

d. he cuts down the tree. After he cuts down the tree, e. it begins
to fall. When it begins to fall, f. the person flees. He flees and
then, g. the canoe tree falls to the ground. When it has fallen to
the ground, h. the person goes over to it. When he has gets to it,
i. he cuts off the top of the tree. When he has cut off the top of
the tree, j. he goes home. He goes home and then, k. he eats.
Exceptions to this will be discussed in a section on participant reference.(Section not yet
written)
The Obligation Modals, Clause Core or Periphery?
The root modal, obligation, is listed by Van Valin (1993) as a core operator. The following are

ProbableWhen these modality markers occur in an Iau clause, they act as `spacers', separating the most
topical noun from the other nouns in the clause, and forming a left dislocated position (LDP).
Spacers are defined as `pause-like' elements whose position indicates discontinuity in the
information structure of the utterance. (Dooley 1990.477-478)
The position of pause relative to the LDP and the spacer in the Iau clause varies as is illustrated
below.

"The punctual forms (9,6,5) along with the totality of action durative form (3) are used to assert
occurrence and assert as fact.
The durative and incompletive forms (7,4,8,2) are used in grammatical contexts that require
irrealis, completive, durative or resultative forms.
Tone Class Totality of Action Events (9.7)Totality of Action tone 9 verbs regularly substitute tone 7 in irrealis grammatical contexts like
imperatives, intentions and statements of probability or future predictions. The following are
some typical uses of tone 9 and tone 7 for this tone class.

by³.
Word speak-Tot.Inc might, will

(Speaking has not yet happened, but is proposed/commanded so that requires a tone 7

In this first set of examples, there is a realis statement with tone 9.The following examples with
tone 7 are all situations where the action is contemplated but has not actually happened.
The next example is a medial verb clause –and if or when clause, part of a conditional sentence..

The tone class 9 event above is hypothetical, not realis and may never happen. So it is marked
by a tone 7 as such.
The following example is taken from a narrative sequence of events, linked by medial verb
repetitive clauses. The linking clauses signal the chain is not finished, another event follows.

This example illustrates the substitution of a tone 7 incomplete aspect in the repeated clause that
indicates the chain of events in not complete. There is more to follow. The main events of the
chain are all marked by Totality of Action view points as independent main clause verbs. I
spoke. I went home. I ate.
When events are irrealis in the sense of being unrealized, still in the future, tone 7 telic
incompletive is substituted for tone 9.

As illustrated above in the final sentence, the words davy⁷ ‘far away’ and foe⁴⁻⁷ ‘close up’ are
being contrasted as two different positions from which to shoot a pig. In the speakers opinion,
older and bigger people are less quick and nimble but also stronger, so it is safer and possible for
them to stay farther away and still have chance of shooting a wild pig. In this case the two
adverbs are the predicated information, that is what the speaker wishes to say about shooting
pigs.

The postpostition ta⁷ normally has a tone 7 on it and fills the postpostion slot noun phrase final.
However, when the noun phrase is part of a clause with a stative locative verb, the postpostion
ta⁷ changes to ta⁹. And ta⁹ becomes a clitic attached to a verb or adverb.

The first example above shows the postposition ta⁷ in it’s unmarked distribution. In the second
clause in the example above. The postposition ta⁷ becomes ta⁹ and is a clitic attached to the verb30and means ‘live in’ Note in the first clause above that the postpostion ta⁷ becomes ta⁹ and is
attached as a clitic to the directional adverb bi² and means ‘up inside’.

StmntPeople who are big like that (/like him), it would be good for them to kill /shoot wild pigs
from far away. It’s the small people (young (nimble) boys) who it’s alright to shoot them
from right next to them /close up.
In examples 1-4 above the postposition foe⁴ is marked with a tone 4. In example 5 the tone
changes from 4 to 4-7. This example is made up of two contrastive sentences. Full grown men
are contrasted with boys in the way it is advisable for them to shoot at pigs. Both contrastive
manners are marked with tone 7. The word for ‘far away’ davy⁷ is normally davy⁸. Davy⁷ di⁸
‘shooting from far away’is contrasted with foe⁴⁻⁷ di⁸ ‘shooting from close up.’ The function of
the tone 7 here is something like the function of the be particle which marks nouns as the new
information being predicated by the clause.
The postpostition ta⁷ normally has a tone 7 on it and fills the postpostion slot phrase final.
However, when the noun phrase is part of a clause with a stative locative verb, the postpostion
ta⁷ changes to ta⁹ and becomes a clitic attached to a verb or adverb.

The first example above shows the postposition ta⁷ in it’s unmarked distribution. In the second
clause in the example above. The postposition ta⁷ becomes ta⁹ and is a clitic attached to the verb
and means ‘live in’ Note in the first clause above that the postpostion ta⁷ becomes ta⁹ and is
attached as a clitic to the directional adverb bi² and means ‘up inside’.
There are two compound postpositionals, tai⁵ta⁹ ‘in/down in (eg the ground)’ and ta⁹bi² ‘be

5.2.2.2 Possessive Noun Phrases
There are four different kind of possessive noun phrases in Iau. The first type of possessive noun
phrase consists of the item possessed followed by the possessor followed a possessive marker.
There are two alternative possesive markers in Iau. The following sentences are examples.
1. Da⁷ Das⁷⁻⁸ be⁸sy⁹

These are women’s clothes
The possessive marker be⁸sy⁹ is more definite. It is used with named persons. The possessive
marker bv⁹ is used with generic class nouns and descriptive phrases.
In the second type of possessive phrase, a possessive pronoun is used to identify the possessor.
In these types of phrases, no possessive marker is used as illustrated below.
Da⁷ av⁷bv⁹
dog his
his dog
The third type of possessive noun phrase in Iau consists of the possessor followed by the item
possessed followed by a possessive marker as illustrated below.
Ty⁷
da⁷ av⁹

the owner of the dog
The fourth type of possessive noun phrase is used for body parts and consists of the possessor
followed by the body part followed by a possessive pronoun. The following is an example.
A⁹ y⁵ o⁸sy⁹

Possessive phrases can be complex. The following are examples of a phrase within a possessive
phrase.

5.2.2.3 Appositional Noun Phrases in Iau
Appositional noun phrases are two noun phrases placed side by side in which the second noun
phrase identifies the participants in the first noun phrase. The following are some examples in

"916.3 Word Order In Iau Clauses
6.3.1 Verb Final
As we have seen in preceeding sections, in Iau the verb with its associated particles always
occurs clause final as is re-illustrated in the following example.
A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷
se⁵.
1s book see-TOT.INC Inten
I am going to look at books.
In the Iau clause above, the verb follows the two nouns. The intention particle “se⁵” is part of the
verb phrase and functions as part of the clause periphery.
6.3.2 Nouns Ordered by Topicality
Nouns in Iau clauses are not ordered according to their grammatical function. That is, they can
occur in the order subject followed by object, or in the order object followed by subject. It is in
fact difficult in Iau to find criteria for labeling a noun as subject or object. The rule of thumb for
the ordering of nouns is as follows: if a noun is the topic of the clause, then it is placed at the
beginning of the clause to the left of other nouns. Other nouns are positioned from left to right in
order of topicality. The following set of sentences illustrate this.
1.A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷
e⁸
da⁹ki⁶ y⁴.
I book see-TOT.INC Nomin good
Info-SNC.NA.NDT
It would be good if I could look at books.
2.Bv⁸ku⁷ bv⁶ doe⁷
e⁸
da⁹ki⁶
y⁴.
book
1s see-TOT.INC Nomin good Info-SNC.NA.NDT
It would be good if I could look at the books.
In the first sentence the pronoun a⁹ `I' is topic of the clause and is also the fronted NP. In
example 2 books the undergoer is the topic of the clause
When three or more nouns occur in a clause, they are ordered on a sliding scale of topicality and
definiteness. The topical nouns are placed to the left of nontopical nouns. Definite nouns preceed
indefinite nouns. The question and answer set illustrate this.
1.Te⁸du⁷be⁷ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸
be⁸
da⁷ bv⁸ da⁸ tv³?
what
Benjamin Cause dog for carry leave- TOT.DUR
What was it that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for?
2.Dai³ du⁷be⁷ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ be⁸ bv⁸ da⁷ da⁸ tv⁹
cassowary that Benjamin
for dog carry leave-TOT.PUN
It was a cassowary that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for.
In each of the sentences above there are three participants involved in the action-Benjamin, the dog, and the animal being hunted. In the examples above, the ordering of
the particle bv⁸ and the noun da⁷ `dog' is reversed. In (1) bv⁸ ‘goal’ occurs after the noun
da⁷ and in (2) it occurs before `da⁷' dog.
The first sentence is a question which asks for the identity of the animal being hunted. The
particle `bv⁸' `for (it)' refers to some unknown animal. The noun `da⁷' on the other hand refers to
a specific animal known to the speaker and hearer. Since the noun da⁷ `dog' is definite and the
animal referred to by the particle bv `for (it)' is indefinite, the speaker places the indefinite
particle bv⁸ to the right of the more definite noun da⁷.
In sentence (2) however the identity of the animal hunted is specified as a cassowary. In (2), the
particle bv⁸ now refers to a definite noun, dai³ `cassowary', which is also the sentence topic as
indicated by its position to the far left of the sentence. Because bv⁸ refers to a noun that is both
definite and topical it must preceed the noun da⁷ which is definite but not topical.
The following sentence is another example of a topical noun preceeding a less topical noun.

"1119.2.1 Who /”Ty⁷⁻⁸’: questions about identity
Who questions are used when the normal focus item in the clause, the event, is known, but the
identity of the actor or agent for that event is unknown. The question word becomes the new
focus information about the topic, the rest of the clause.
There are two main `who' compound question words in Iau.
ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴
who? person identity marker
ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸
who? agent as focus/new unknown information
The word ‘boe⁴’ (identity marker) used in the example below is in a topic as predicate focus
type sentence where the new predicated information is on the left side of the clause and marked
by ‘du⁷be⁷’.
Ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³?
Si⁸a⁸da³ boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³.

da⁹?
Epi boe⁴
du⁷be⁷ dui⁹
da⁹.
who ID Mkr that w.pig-by bitten Epi Iden Mkr that w.pig-by bitten
It was Epi who was bitten by a wild pig.
The question word with the boe⁴ identity particle can also be used when the `who' question word
occurs in the normal predicate position as illustrated below.
Ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴?
this who
ID mkr
Who is this?
A⁹ boe⁴ y³.
I Iden Mkr Statement Mkr
It's me.
As indicated above, the question word ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ consists of the question word ty⁷⁻⁸ `who' and the
identity marker boe⁴. The particle boe⁴ is used to mark statements of personal identity. The use of
the personal identity marker boe is also used to mark the identity information in the answers to
the questions in the illustrations above.
The question word ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸ consists of the question word ty⁷⁻⁸ and the noun marker be⁸. Be⁸
marks nouns or noun phrases within the clause when they are focus, predicated information. The
tone morpheme 8 marks them as causative agent The following is an example of the use of the
content question word ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸.
Da⁷ ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸
di³?
This dog, who NMkFocus/Ag killed (it)?
Who killed this dog?
In the question above the question word `who' uses the noun marker be⁸ because the person the
speaker wants to know about is also the one who brought about the action. That is the speaker
wants to know who acted on the dog and brought about his death.
9.1.2 What Questions
The four what question words in Iau are listed below.
te⁸de⁹ what? (predicate form)
te⁸du⁷ what thing?
/te⁸du⁷be⁷
te⁸be⁸de⁷ what kind of? (from where?,
which place?)
te⁸ (o⁷su⁹) de⁹ what kind of (leaf)?
te⁸ (bi⁸) du⁸ what kind of (news)? (Content)
The question te⁸de⁹ is the predicate form of the `what' question word in Iau. It consists of the
question word te⁸ `what' and the stative particle de⁹. The following question and answer set
illustrates the use of the question word te⁸de⁹.
Bv⁷ te⁸de⁹?
this what
What is this?","[111, 112]"
"109Content Question
Ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³.
who
that arrive
Who is it that has arrived?
The first question above is a yes-no question. A speaker asks a yes-no question to find out if the
information in the question is true or not. When the speaker asks a yes-no question, he wants the
hearer to confirm or deny the information in the question. In the example above, the speaker is
not sure whether the the plane is coming or not.
The second question above is an example of a content question. Content questions are who,
what, when, where, why, how questions. The speaker asks a content question when he doesn't
know some specific bit of information in the sentence. In the Iau content question in (2) above,
the speaker doesn't know the identity of the subject so he asks the hearer,""Who is it that arrived?""
The question word `who' is underlined in example (2) above. Each of the two kinds of questions
in Iau will be discussed in detail in the following sections.","[109, 110]"

Notice that the ‘be’ markers are also used in these kinds of clauses, marking nouns that are are
being asserted as additional information about the topical event but are also already given
/known.
6.2.2.1 MARKING CLEFT CONSTRUCTIONS IN IAU
The equivalent of a cleft construction (It is “x” that ...) in Iau is composed of a noun marked by
formulaic particles in a topicalized position. The topicalized noun in a cleft construction is the
new predicated information in the clause, while the rest of the clause is the given /known
information. The cleft construction equivalent occurs in Iau in sentence initial position in topic
slot, is followed by slight pause. The topicalized item can be a noun, a noun phrase or a clause.
Ba⁷bv⁹ da⁷ du⁷be⁷ du⁹
avy³.
this dog that
wild-pig bark at-TOT.PUN
That is a dog that is barking at a pig. (Answers the question What is that? (in response
to a picture that is not understood or an unidentified sound))
Da⁷ du⁷be⁷ a⁹ be⁷
di³.

It was a dog that I killed. (Answers the question “What was it that you killed?”)
Da⁷ by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ a⁹ be⁷
di³.
dog that
I Nmkr kill-TOT.PUN
It was a dog (not anything else) that I killed not anything else /another animal. (In
contexts where there are other possibilities and the speaker is emphasizing this as the
truth)
The cleft construction marking particles, du⁸/du³; du⁷be⁷ /du⁸be⁷; and by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ /by⁷by⁹ du⁷,
are all compounds of the particle du⁷/du⁸. The following are the meanings of the particle
components:
du: identity is being asserted but in the topic rather than the predicate position
dv: identity given /already known
be: participant is known, already given but being asserted in clause
by: info established as fact
The particles are listed below:
du⁸ /du³ /du⁷ it’s when..., it’s ...that
du⁷be⁷ / du⁸be⁷ it’s ...x... that does /is....
by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ /by⁷by⁹ du⁷ it’s (only ) ...x.. that....
In narrative and procedural text, these markers occur most frequently in closing comments such
as the following where du⁷be⁷ marks two contrastive pig traps, the writer’s which caught a pig
and his older brother’s which did not. In the procedural text about making a wooden dish, the
marker appears in the closing summary which tells which two kinds of wood are the only
acceptable ones for making the dish.

This is a tree.
The `what' question word te⁸du⁷ consists of the question particle te⁸ and du⁷ a left dislocation as
focus info particle. Te⁸du⁷ is used to ask about the identity of a thing when it is new information
placed in a left dislocated topic position. Normally information in this position would be already
given, not new predicated information. This is in contrast to the previous form te⁸de⁹ which is
used as a predicate in the sentence, the normal location for new predicated information. The
following are some examples.
1.Bv⁷ te⁸du⁷ du⁷be⁷ ba³?
this what that come
What is this that is coming?
Bv⁷ da⁷ du⁷be⁷ ba³.

What (thing) are you going for?
A⁹ du⁹
bv⁸ i⁹ a³.

The te⁸du⁷ form of the `what' question word is a abbreviated version of the question markerr
te⁸du⁷be⁷. There are two examples below.
1.Te⁸du⁷be⁷ di⁹ be⁷
da⁸ bi⁶?
what
you NMkr carry arrive
What kind of thing did you bring?
2.Au⁷ te⁸du⁷be⁷ di³?

The question word te⁸be⁸de⁷ means `what kind of/from where' and is usually used in reference to
people to ask what group or race they belong to. It is a description question word. (See also the
section on `Where Questions.) The following question and answer set is an example.
Ty⁷
te⁸be⁸de⁷ fi⁹su³ o⁷su⁹ davy⁹ a³.

What kind of people make pandanus leaf mats?
Ty⁷
Da⁸di⁷ fi⁹su³ o⁷su⁹ davy⁹ a³.
person Dani pandanus leaf make Habit
The Danis make pandanus leaf fishing mats.
When the generic term is known but the specific identity of the item is unknown, the following
construction is used in Iau to ask about the identity of the item.
Bv⁷ te⁸ o⁷su⁹ de⁴?
this what leaf is
What kind of leaf is this?
Ba⁷bv⁹ ko³ o⁷su⁹.

This is a breadfruit leaf.
Any noun can be substituted in the position between the question word te⁸ and the stative particle
de⁴.
The `what' question particle te⁸ can also occur in the left dislocated position marked as new
information by the particles dv³, du⁸ or du⁷be⁷ to ask `what thing?'. These are illustrated in two
sample questions below.

6.2.2.2 Left Dislocated Positions, SPACERS AND FOCUS IN IAU
LDP activation of participants and propsSection 6.1.5 showed how the spacers in Iau form LDP's which are used to activate and maintain
discourse topical participants. Clauses with LDP's that activate discourse topical participants and
give identificational information about them have broad sentence focus. In these sentences both
the information in the LDP and the predicate are being asserted.
Props, minor participants and non-topical temporal and locational frameworks are activated and
identified within the clause.
The following examples are some examples of participants and props being activated in LDP's.

Spkr 2: I'm going to use them to kill fish.
In the first example above, the speaker is refuting the basic underlying assumption that the
woman in question is married. The second example illustrates the use of the particle ‘to’ to
emphasize that Speaker 2's own experience in using goggles to catch fish is contrary to Speaker
1's who has never used them.
The particle ‘e’ is more rare than the other mood particles in conversational discourse. The ‘e’
particle is used on statements that the hearer is using to justify or explain his action. The
following segment of conversational discourse illustrates this.
Di⁹ to⁶ ba³tu³ sa⁸

The final sentence marked by the particle ‘e’ functions in the discourse context to give
information explaining why Speaker 1 came to Speaker 2 to ask him about corne.
Mood Particles Eliciting a Response from the Hearer.
There are 7 segmental mood particles which mark propositions which the speaker is using to
elicit a response from the hearer. They are listed below. Syllables with tone variants do not have
a tone on them in the list below
be/ba (Unstressed) Yes-No Question Marker (?Mkr)
asy Directs the hearer's attention to something (Attn)
bv Request permission /instruction /action (Rq)
dy Imperative (Imp)
dy⁴da Emphatic /Repeated Imperative (EImp)
day Prohibition (PRoh)
The unstressed be/ba marker is used to mark yes-no questions in which the speaker is trying to
elicit certain information as a response from the hearer. The following is an example.
Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶
ba⁷
ba³?
plane tomorrow come-TOT.INC ?Mkr-RS.SA
Is the plane coming tomorrow?
The particle asy which occurs with several tone variations, is used to direct the speaker's
attention to something. The following sentence is an example.
Dai⁸dv⁹ doe⁷
a⁹sy⁹.
butterfly see-TOT.INC Attn-NRS.SA
Look at the butterflies!
The asy particle not only calls the speaker`s attention to something but also has the connotation
that the speaker anticipates it is highly relevant or of interest to the hearer.
The bv particle marks requests for permission and also requests for the hearer to instruct the
speaker on what the hearer wants the speaker to do. The bv particle is illustrated below.
A⁹ i⁷
bv³?
1S go-TOT.INC Req-RS.SA
May I go?","[53, 54]"
"126The exclamation particle y⁵ also occurs in contexts where the speaker is reiterating something
that has already been said in a more emphatic way. The following is an example.
Spkr 1
Fi⁹ da⁹ sa⁴dy⁴ i⁷bai³ta⁷ doe⁸
be⁷

In the following example, the particle y⁵ shows disbelief on the part of the speaker.
Spkr 1

The exclamation particle ai⁹av² is used to lament or express the speaker's opinion that a situation
should not have happened as it did. The Iau exclamation ai⁹av² occurs in one text when the
speaker almost fell out of a tree he was climbing because some vine he was pulling himself up
with pulled loose. Afterwards he talks to himself, saying. ""Oh no!, I almost slipped.""","[126, 127]"

Specifiers
Following the classifiers are another group of modifiers, the specifiers. These particles specify
certain members of a class as opposed to others. Specifier particles are words like ‘another one,
some, or a different one’. The following are some examples in Iau.

Case Marking Particles
The final particles in the Iau noun phrase are the optional particles which mark the case role of
the noun relative to discourse topic.The also mark the information in the noun phrase as
predicated information. For more information on predicated information see section 6.2 below
about pragmatic focus –presupposition and the Iau clause.
The following is a list of the focus/case marking particles in Iau.
be⁷ /be⁴ /be⁸marks noun phrase as predicated information about the case role of noun relative
to discourse topic
by⁷ same as be⁷ but refers to a specific item or individual known to the hearer
di⁷ body part as instrument
fe⁷ /fa⁷ benefactive
bv⁸ goal (for, to)
fi⁵ undergoer source (take away from)62The noun markers be and by are used to mark noun phrases when the noun phrase is part of the
new information that is being predicated about the topic. This is illustrated by the following
question and answer set.
Kaf⁷ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸
taui⁷
di³?
bow this
who TopCMkr make-TOT.INC PBd-RLZ
Who made this bow?
Das⁷⁻⁸ be⁸
Das
TopCMkr
Das made it.taui⁷
di³.
make-TOT.INC PBd-RLZIn the question and answer set above, the speaker and hearer are talking about a topic, a bow that
someone made. The new information that the questioner wants to know is: who made the bow. In
the example above the question word `who' and the name `Das' are both marked with the same
noun marker be⁸ to indicate that this noun and not the verb is the new information that is being
predicated about the topic, the bow.
The tone on these particles indicates the case role of the noun. The be and by noun markers have
three tone variants. The tone 8 variant be⁸ indicates that the marked noun is the causative agent
that acted on the topic noun. In the previous example Das was the one who acted on the bow and
made it. This is indicated by the tone 8 on the be⁸ case marker. The following sentence is an
another example.

flee-TOT.DUR
Someone had already taken the news before (we got there) and so they had all already
fled.
The sentence above is answering the question `So you didn't actually kill any one on the raid?'
The answer is “No”. The reason is because of the news that had been carried to the people ahead
of time. The noun bi⁸ `news' is marked by the be⁸ particle as the cause of conversation topic, the
fact that they did not kill anyone.
When a tone 4 occurs on the topic case marker be⁴, it indicates that the noun is either acted on
by the topic or the noun is the instrument or means of acting on the topic. This is illustrated by
the following examples:
1. Fi⁹
kae² be⁴

9.0 PRAGMATIC FUNCTIONS OF SENTENCES IN IAU DIALOGUE
In narrative discourse sentences function to give information, that is ,tell a story. In
conversational dialogue, sentences are used to get information from the other speaker (ask
questions), to give opinions /make statements of fact or to get the other speaker to do something
(commands). For more detail see section 10 below.
9.1 Questions In Iau
Questions are used in Iau mainly to get information from the hearer that the speaker does not
know. Rhetorical questions exist, but are used mainly for scolding, not for topic introduction.
There are two kinds of questions in Iau: yes-no questions and content questions. An example of
each kind of question is given below. The bolded words are the question markers.
Yes-No
Fv⁷
ba⁷
ba³?
plane come ?-UnCertain
Is the plane coming?","[108, 109]"
"42The first sentence is a generic /gnomic truth question. It could also be considered habitual action
for that location. It is marked with the be particle because it refers to a period of time in the past,
and an action already realized multiple times within that time period.
The second sentence could be an answer to the question above but is actually taken from a
different conversation. The period of time being referred to is a definite, known time period,
“when I was up at Saita”. During this definite time period the event ‘eat pork’ happened
mulitiple times.
In the final sentence. be marks an action that was habitually done in the past but is no longer
done. It can be translated “used to .
The following is an example of be marking an event that just occurred but has now stopped. A
young boy and older man who has a bad headache are alone in the men’s house. The sick man
hears a very irritating knocking noise and asks what that is? The following is the boy’s answer.
A⁹ i⁶ du⁷be⁷ u⁸ fui⁴
be⁸

1s head that wood knock-TEL.INC DBd-CRLZ Info-SA.ADT

The following example shows the be particle with a tone 3 rlzd morpheme indicating that the
proposition, he was in the process of killing the pig, is now a past situation no longer applicable
and evidently unsuccessful.

Uncer-RS.SA

‘Ay’:A Definite Beginning
The ay particle is defined as marking a multiple unbounded event which has a definite starting
point. The event is bounded initially but not terminally. The ay particle marks the proposition
as a multiple occurrence situation beginning at some temporally bounded point in time and
continuing on over an indefinite period of time. The following sentence illustrates the use of the
ay particle to mark a definite starting point for an event which will continue on indefinitely into
the future.

In the example below, the particle ay marks the action of going to the garden as having a past
beginning point and continuing on into the present. The question under discussion is where is
this man?

‘Dy’:Future Pending
The particles dy and dybe mark events that have been planned or decided upon, but have not as
yet been implemented. Dy is actually a deictic verb that can be glossed “do it/that”, here used as
a particle with tone 4 indicating it is an unrealized but pending event. The following is an
illustration.
The status markers dy and dybe mark the status of situations which are unrealized but which
are planned, intended, or about to be implemented. The following are some examples.

In the first sentence above, the situation marked by dy was being implemented but was
frustrated and the opportunity to do it was terminated by the bird flying away.
In next sentence, the speaker marks the situation as an intendion with the modality particle se⁴
and then indicates with the reality status particle dy⁵ that the situation is although still
unrealized is pending implementation and will indeed be brought about.
There is a second compound particle that indicates a frustrated action that is no longer able to
brought about. It is a compound of the pending realization particle dy⁴ and the cessation of
durative action particle be discussed above. See the following two examples.

Summary
In summary, propositions marked by di and be, both temporally bounded, refer to situations
which occur at a unique particular point in time ( di), or over a unique specific period in time (
be). Propositions marked by ay begin at some unique specifiable point in time and continue on
indefinitely from that time on. Propositions marked by a occur over some indefinite period of
time with no temporal boundaries.","[42, 43, 44]"

The Tone Morphemes on the Yes-No Question Marker
Yes-No Questions in Iau are marked by the unstressed particle be with one of three different tone
morphemes. The tone morphemes vary according to the degree of input that the speaker feels he
needs from the hearer, and also how certain the speaker is that his information is correct. The
table below displays the meanings of the 3 tone morphemes occuring on the be question marker.
Degree of Anticipated Hearer Input
None Possible Highly Probable
934NIPIHPIThe use of the tone 9 morpheme indicates that the speaker is relatively certain that the
information content of the question is correct. The speaker does not anticipate any significant
information content input from the hearer. The following sentence illustrates the use of tone 9 on
a Yes-No Question Marker in Iau.
A⁴
ty⁷
Bi⁷e⁹ a⁷se⁹ u⁶
di⁹
be⁹
father person Bie SeqMkr before kill-TOT.PUN ?Mkr-NI
So the people from Bie first killed father, right?
The speaker in the example above is using the question to prompt the hearer to retell a story
about an enemy raid. The speaker already knows that the information content of the question is
correct since he got the information from the hearer previously. He wants the speaker to answer
the question `Yes' and then begin to tell the story.
A tone 3 morpheme is used on a Yes-No Question Marker when the speaker has reason to
believe that the information is correct but feels he needs input /confirmation from the hearer.
This is the most common tone occurring on the Yes-No Question Marker. The following
sentence is an example.
Fv⁷
ba⁷
be³?
Plane come-TOT.INC ?Mkr-PI
Is the plane coming?
In the example above, the speaker thinks the plane may be coming and he is asking the hearer for
either confirmation or denial.
The tone 4 morpheme is used on the Yes-No Question Marker to indicatethat the speaker is not
at all sure of the information content of the question. The following is an example from a
conversational text.","[55, 56]"
"76Status particles as discussed in the section above in 5.2 on Iau Verb Phrases, mark the situation
as realis vs irrealis and also indicate the degree of temporal boundedness.
The evidential particle da illustrated in example 28 above, indicates that the speaker feels the
hearer knows or should know the information content of the utterance. In example 25 it marks
the generally known expectation, that the man was going to leave, which was never actually
realized.
The mood particles in Iau indicate the communicative function of the utterance and the degree to
which the speaker is asserting the utterance. See the section on Iau Verb phrases 5.1 above for
more information.
