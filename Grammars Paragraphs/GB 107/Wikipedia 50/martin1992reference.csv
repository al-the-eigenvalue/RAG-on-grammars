"For adjectival sentcnces! the ani negltive has both the short tbrm and the long tbrm, but only the
long occurs tbr the mds negative. And tlere are some adjectives which never take the strong negative,
notahly those describing welther. There is no rChwupci mOs hxt:r fiom chwiiw-, and 'fEpci m6s hatr -^:
from t€w-'be warm'can have as its subject only mul'water'or the like, but never nalCssi),the
weather'. (For water, or anything you can touch, 'cohl' is cha-.) The intransitive verh m6.cah.
-a'
'becomes deficient' will not take the mds negative. perhaps hecause a shortened frrrm of mds is
incorporated in the stem itself; there is no 'm6s mGcatanta or 'm&calaci m6s hanta.
As remarked in $5.2.9, we might wish to consitler ani in ani 'ta 'it is not' as a precopular noun. .Korean grammarians usually treat anita as an unanalyzed stem, tle 'negative copula"" as against the :
affirmative copula ita, and that is certainlv a convenient way kr look at it. The one critical context that _.,
coukl help point toward a preference for rrne treatment or the other on morphophonemic grounds is !-=
indecisive: the past is either /anietta/ = ani 'ess.ll or iilnyetta/ = an' yess.t:t. So we have no ::'when in -.-i
clearcut reason to choose to write anita. aninya, ... (tbllowing the usual Hankul spelling
doubt do not analyze"") rather than ani 'ta, ani 'n yo, ... , as we have rlone in this book. Notice ttrat tlri
grammar of ani 'ta ahd ita is different, in that the negative marks the pre<licate complement (the B of
""is 4""1, as well as the subject, with the nominative particle; but in the iffirmative, with ani absent, the ir#
coputa is attached to the cqmplement with no marking particle: A ka B ka ani 'ta 'A is not B'
f.l
B (i)ta'A is B'. But sometimes the nominative particle i/ka is omitted after the complement in
negative copula sentence, too, anrt that was true of the language in the early Hankul rexts, as well;
the entry tbr the panicle in Part ll. The particle is sometimes omitted also after the complement of
toynta'becomes'. And i/ka is oblig:rtorily suppressed when a tbcus particle or delimiter (such as
un/nun, to) is attached; it is usually omined, too, when tle complement is delimited hy man or ppun
'only'. The erpression A ka ani 'la B 'ta 'lt's not A, it's B' has roughly the same meaning as B 'ci A
ka ani 'ta 'lt's B, not A'. To say 'it is neither A nor (is it) B' you highlight the complements and
conjoin the sentences with -ko, as in Ku kes un kaykwuli to ani 'ko, olchangi to ani 'la 'That is
neither a frog nor a tadpole'. with the affirmative, since nothing can intervene between thc
complement and the copula, you highlight the copula itself (in its summative form i-ki to hn-'it
indeed/also'): Ku i nun uysa (i)ki to hako um.ak-kn (i)ki lo hata'He is both a physician and
musician' = Ku nun uysa'mye (tto) um.ak-ka'ta 'He is a physician ancl (also) a musiciln'. Or, tbe
sentence can be rephrased as 'not only - but also -.': Ku i nun u.vsa (i)ki man (or (i)l ppun man) rnl
'la urn.ak-ka (i)ki to hata 'He is not only a physician Lrut also a-'€

A Reference Grammar of Korean is a description of the language spoken in both nonh and south
Korea in the second half of the 20rh century. This material is given historical perspective by a
description of the structure of the language of the Hankul texts of the second half of the fifteenthcentury and somewhat later, here called Middle Korean (MK); occasional reference is made to still
earlier forms of the language, for which we have only very limited materials in the form of Chinese
characters used for their sound value (i.e. as phonograms) or inferences that ue made from systematic
irregularities in the grammar of the earliest Hankul texts. Anention is paid also to dialect variation
reported for the modern language and errlier speech. The core of the modern material reflects the
pronunciation and usage of speakers who were born in Seoul betbre 1950, but thrt has been updated by
observations of the speech habits of younger speakers, both in Seoul and elsewhere. ln addition to
direct elicitation, tape recordings, anrt written materials, VCR tapes of quite recent Seoul TV programshave provided authentic data of the contemporary usages referred to in various sections of the book.
The sentences are presented in a Romanized form which can be readily converted to a Hankul
representation, but they are intended to write spoken language, and do not dways coincide with theprescribed speltings. The reader should be aware that Romanized forms such as pat.e and iss.ey yo are
not misukes, but represent the relaxed pronunciation of the Seoul speakers who have provided or
checked them, rhough the speakers would indeed themselves write the words with the usually seen
spellings 'pat.a' and 'iss.e yo-, following the pronunciations heard in other areas and increasingly
among younger speakers in
r
Although a good deal is said about the history of sounds and forms, this work does not address
questions of prehistory or genetic relationships. When references are made to Japanese, Chinese, or
English data the intention is usually to show how the Korean counterparts are similar or different, or toseoul.add perspective on the meaning.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

texts. ltr
colloquial passages, such as those of 1447 Sekpo, the shorter forms are somewhat more frequent ttt+
the longer ones. The long negative is a sentential negation, and implies a greater scope than the shoit .ffi
negative, which basically negates just the verb phrase. But you will sometimes find a short negativc
doing the work of the longer form (i.e. negating the whole sentence) when the stem iuself is short;
conversely, the long form will sometimes be preferred tbr longer stems (especially of adjectives) even
when the scope does not extend beyond the verbal phrase irself. The short negative is quite direct; in
certain situations, the long negrtive may be perceived as less brusque and tlerefore more-*f;

"pmrr 297A Reference Grammar of KoreanThe chrtice of particular classes of nouns to precetle the copull ita and of particular classes of
ldjectives and verbs will impose constrainB upon the choice of wortJs elsewhcre in the sentence. We
do not say *K!ly ka Kim sensayng_ul cwuk.nunla'The dog dies Mr Kim' nor, except by a special
dispensation called 'personification"", Kiing i ayki lul ponta 'The ball looks at the baby'. But in our
choice of a particular one of the three nuclear sentence types, we impose much broader constraints
upon the kinds of operations possible, and that is why we need all three types, even though the
predicates oithe second and third type may be regarded as restricted subclasses oithe tirst.
(2) We can EXPAND the sentence. by prethcing the predicate with one or more adverhial phra.ses
lnd/or. in the sase of the copular sentence. by prethcing the noun with an adnominal phrase:
(Cikum) (emeni ka) ayki lul poNTA 'Now the morher looks at the baby'.
(Yeki se) cip i KilUTA 'The houses are large (here)'.
(Ku kes i) wuli ctp rTA 'Thar (thing), it is our house'.
We do not look at the structure of the phrases themselves as converted; we do not set up 'kernel
phrases"" from which the others are derived by a series of operations, since the operation would consist
merely of adrlition. However, parts of phrases that are themselves derived from sentences, such as
moditjer phrases, will include conversions listed below. It would be possible, of course, to assign sontewhat arbitrarily**a kind of kernel sentence that would derive each phrase so that noun
subject
marker could be obtained from the kernel sentence Ayki ka ponta 'The baby looks at it', but that
procedure seems both unnatural and unnecessary
(3) We can coNvERT or transfbrm the sentence by applying somewhat interdependent processes:
L status elevation: normal honorific.
2. style shift: plain
formal,
semiformal (authoritative),
familiar,
intimate (including
intimate casual and circumstantial), + polite (including polite casual and circumstantial).
3. tense-aspect shift: present (or timeless)
past,
frtture.
tentative,
retrospective; and
combinations of these.
4. finite-mood shift: statement + question, + command,
proposition, + apperception.
5. voice shift: active + causative,
passive.
6. negation: aftirmative + negative. + strong negative.
7. condensation: sentence
nominalizatiolt, + 3.1no*'nalization,
atlverbialization.
8. quotation: sentence
quoted sentence.
A basic form is postulated tbr each category and labeled above as 'normal, plain. present, statement,
active, atfirmative sentence', to which all three of our nuclear sentences correspond. The other forms
mentioned are considered as produced by some process of derivation from the basic form.
(4) We can transform the ExPANstoNs ofexpanded sentences by means ofthe following processes:
9. switching emphasis (order of the expansions). We are assuming no ""normal' order, but that
may be untenable, since there is usually a least marked version, such as rnrE - pLAcE - suBJEcT -+**+****++** --OBLIQUE OBJECTS . DIRECT OEJECT . VERB.10. subdual offocus (wirh the particle un/nun).
I l. highlighting of tbcus (with the particle to).
12. restriction (with the particle man) and other focus settings.13. grammatical specification by a.ssigning particles to roles, such as marking the subject, object,
and indirect object; or the instrumentality, location, time, and so forth.","[292, 293]"

11.7.8. Negative sentences with positive force.
In negative questions usetl rhetorically the intended tbrce is positive: Kaci anh.el,! 'lsn't he ttlE
going?' or 'He's going, isn't he?' = 'Surely he is going'. Such sentences allow the suspective tbrm of ;-It*,dili
#,u'-ap,qRrA Reference Grammar of Korearrr 323ilrc past antl the futurelrntl even the copula: Kass.ci unh.e?!'Surely he went', Klkeyss.ci anh.e?!
'Surely he will go', tlaksayng ici (itss.ci) lnh.e?! 'Surely he is (w:rs) il srudent'. As statemens (or
nunrhetorical negarive questions), thgse sentences mus! be Kuci lnh.rss.e, Kaci anh.keyss.e, and
I{aksayng i an' ye(ss.e). (With the proper question intonation, those sentences can function
rhetorically, too.) The -ri anh- structure is commonly shonened to -c'anh-. The rhetorical use of
negative questions extends to expressions of doubt, t'ear, or anxiety: Kass.ci anh.ulq ka kekceng
sulepta 'l am afraid/worried that he may have gone'. For more on this. see Kim Tongsik 1981.
I 1.8. Nominalizations.
Nominalization is the process of taking a sentence and turning it into a nomind phrase that can be
used in some larger sentence ui a single noun nright be used:Poki (ka crih.tu) 'Lrxrking (is nicc = is nice-looking)'.
Ponta 'tle kxrks at it'
Plywuki (ka elyeptl)'To lelrn it (is hard)'.
l'aywunta'He lcarns
Oki (lul palantu) '(we hope) that he is coming'.
Orrla 'He is coming'
Chamka haki (lul kircel hanta) '(He refuses) to participate'.
Chamka hanta 'He panicipares'
As these examples show, one common nominalization uses the suMtttATtvE form (stem + -ki):
poki; cdh.ta
ponl:r
cip iki. Another common nominalization uses an
cdh,ki; cip ita
cwunun kes ul
ADNONflNALIZATION ($ I1.9) + kes 'thing, one, tact, act, ... ': cwunta 'He gives it'
(= cwuki lul) cwuce hanta'He hesitates to give it'. @arlier Korean used the substantive form -um
tbr that kintl of nominllizltion. See below.)
The nominalized senrence can be treated much Iike any noun. lt can be followed by a particle, by
another nominal which it moditres (na-kaki ccn'befbre going out', 6ps.ki ttaymun 'because there
were none'), by various parricles, antl occasionally by the copull: ileh,key haki 'ta 'Let's decide to do
it this way'. Nominalizations wirh ke; are especially flexible in use, and they occur freely predicated
by the copuh, sometimes with special meanings: Yeki se n' iSmpay lul an phinun kes ita 'It's a
matter of not smoking here = It's No Smoking here'. For further examples, see kes and -ki in Pan II.
The nominalized sentence may already contain adjuncts of its own (subjecs, objects, etc.), so that
when it is turned into a nominal that is used itselfas an adjunct ofthe matrix sentence into which it is
embedded you will sometimes find a sequence of phrases each marked with the same particle. In such
cases the prrtisle after the nominalization ot'ten drops: Chayk ul ilk.ki (lul) cdh,a hanun ya? 'Do you
enjoy reading books?'; Phyenci lul ssuki (lul) sicak hrnta'He stans to write the letter'.
A less common nominalization is marle with the sUBsTANTIVE form (stem -um/-m). Aside
tiom the sentence-t'inal use in the DocuruENTARY style ($tt.3), and certain somewhat literary idioms
(see -um ey and -um ulo in Part II), most cases of -um are single verbs or adjectives turned into
nouns. But sometimes a larger source sentence is involved:

"The name'infinitive"" is here applierl to the ending typicrlly shaped -e, and the forms made by
attaching the appropriate shape to verb stems. The ret'erence should not be confused with the use of
that term in talking about the grammar of other languages, though it has been applied to a very similar
form in Japanese. English speakers name verbs by the translation of the Latin infinitive 'to "" but
Koreans name a verb by the indicative assertive -.la even when that form is not otherwise in use, as is
true when mekta is replaced by mek.nunta 'eats', with obligatory marking as a processive verb.
The Korean infinitive is used in the tbllowing ways:
(l) by iaelfat the end ofa nontlnal clause to mean'and so'or'and then';
(2) as a connecting form used with an auxilirry verb ($7.5) or to link two ordinary verbs in a kind of
*regular
compound"", such as il.e na-'get up', na o- + nt-{F'come out', al.e tut-'understand', ... ;
(3) followed by the panicle se with about the same meaning as (l), but more colloquial;
(4) followed by the particle ya with the meaning 'only if
' in such expressions irs -€ ya ha- and -e
ya toy-'only if we - will itdo' ='wehave to (do it)';
(5) followed by the particle to with the meaning 'even though ' in such expressions as
to coh'be all right even if (one does)' = 'may (do), it is all right (to do)';
(6) followed by the particle la to make a command in the unquoted plain style;
(7) by itself at the end of a sentence to present a statement, question, command, or suggestion in rhe
rNrrNrArE sryle ($l 1.3);
(8) tbllowed by the particle yo at the end of a sentencc to present a statement, question, command, or
suggesrion in the poLtre style (|il 1.3).
The typical shape ofthe intinitive ending is -e, but the shape is -a when the last vowel ofthe stem
is o or a w which is reduced from a basic o, such as wi
o- + -a 'comes'. For stems ending in -.ahthe usual infinitive is -.ah.a pronounced /aal, as in tih.a'arrives'
but tih.e (pronounced /taae/) is
sometimes heard. For ambivalent stems the intinitive is -ay, coming from hay, the intjnitive of ha-, as
in Emulay
(p)p6.ye(hF 'be misty' is usually treated as (p)p0.Jey and
Amule(h)-, but (p)pii.yay
pronounced /(p)puey/ ($4.3). The int'initive of the inseparable postnominal adjective low- 'be
(characterized by)' is regularly lowa, but there is a conrmon colloquial variant lowe; lt is perhaps to be
explained by the older tbrm ot'low- which is said to have been lowup (or perhaps lowuw-?). ln the
literary language, in literary clichtis in the colloquial, in dialects, and in the standardizing prescriptions
of the Korean Language Society the entling is -a if the last vowel of the stem is /a/, as well as if it is
lol, aruJ occasiona.lly in texts we trnd -t usetl after other vowels (Cr the colloquial variant ia = ie'it
is'). We can treat pat.a as a variant tbr the Seoul pat.e, but tiom tlre point of view of the Korean
Language Society, pat.e is a colloquial variant of pat.a. The Seoul tbrm has been around a while:
l8E7 Scon 107 has patela'rcceive [itj!' despite the tirst tbrm in (id, 160) pas.lcwua (= /pakkwa/)
'wolna'la).
wonela = pakkwe one la
There are eleven special comments to be made regarding alternations of stem and infinitive
ending. The t'irst six of these apply correspondingly to the attachment of the past marker (typically
-ess-) as well as to the int'initive (typically -c). Statements 7 through I I do not apply to the past marker.",[251]

verbs of departure and arrival; (3) historical present; (4) command-like instructions, such as recipes or
stage directions; (5) citing a series of actions. For more on the retrospective, see p. 325.

11.5. Nlood conversions.iIn speaking of mood conversions we use the term 'mood"" in a somewhat narrower sense than
before, to ret'er to the finite moods. Specitically, we treat the sTATEMENT as basic and regard each of
as a conversion from that.
question, command, proposition, and apperception
the other moods
Because of the complexities of form taken in the various styles ($11.3), I have prepared a table to
display the forms used for each category and it includes also the retrospective forms ($l 1.4) because of
their interrelated complexities. In the tahle an arrow pointing up means ""use the simple statement
form, perhaps with a different intonation"". An arrow pointing to the left means 'use a form from a less
polite style"", one pointing to the right means 'use a form from a more polite style"". An arrow pointing
both lett antl right means'use either a less or a more polite style"". The difference between the styles is
not entirely a gradation ofpoliteness as such. to be sure, but tbr the purposes ofthis table we will so
consider it. Some categories offer several possibilities, for which there is generally a slight difference
in usage; the options are cited here in the order of the relative frequency with which they are chosen.
The table on p. 306 summarizes the facts that are discussed in detail, style by style, in later sections. In
the table Okwun represents also G)kwumen and kulye represents also kwulye.
There are several colloquial and dialect forms that do not appear in the table, such as -(su)pci yo,
'(u)psey, -la kwu, -ca kut, ... . They will be found as individual entries in Part lI.",[301]
"The apperceptive endings -kwun (a), kwumen, -kwulye are artached to adjectives, to iss- and cps-,
and to -€!is- and 'keyss-, as in: coh.k*'un! @r cdh.kwun a! or c6h.kwumen!or coh.kwulye!) 'oh,

'Why, they've seen it!'; Pokeyss.kwun a!'We're going to see it!' But verb stems use dre processivenlrditier -l the apperceptive postrnodifier kwun (kwun a, kwumen, kwulye), as in Ponun kwun (a)!
'\rhy, you're looking at it!'. And the copula stem is ollen replaced by a variurr ilo-,: Cip ilokwun a!
or Cip ikwun a! 'Why, it's a house!' tYi Hyosang l99l says these tbrms represent sudden perception
of unassimilated intbrmation or evidence, said to express oneself ratier than intbrm the listener.

(2) The same construction omining the ya: Polun? Pwass.tun? Largely contined to phyengan.
PLAIN sTYLE: Retrospective apperceprion.
The retrospective apperceptive -tu-klvun (tu-kwun a, -tu-kwumen, -tu-kwulye) anaches to any
stem; or, you can use the full form from which that is probably abbreviated, the retrospective modifier
+ the postmoditier kwun (kwun a) and variants kwumen and kwulye: Polun kwun = Potukwun
'Why, I see he's been (tbund to be) looking at it!'
PLAIN sryl-E: Suggestion or proposirion.
The subjunctive assertive -ca is used to express the meaning'let's do it': Poca'Let's lbok at it!'. The
mood does not occur for adjective, copula, -ess- or -keyss-; nor for Eps-, but iss- can make a
proposition in one of its meanings, Iss.cl 'Let's stay!' (Ihe negative is Iss.ci mtrlca 'Let's not stay!')
PLAIN sTyLE: Commantl.
When t'inal in an unquoted verbal sentence, a command is expressed with the infinitive -e
the*particle la, as in Prvii la! 'Look at it!' (Certain verbs have an alternant infinitive form in this
construction; see $8.3.6.) The tirrmally corresponding conversion of an adjectival sentence produces an
exclamation: C0h.a lal'How nice!'ln a quoted sentence ($ll.ll) the command is expressed by the
subjunctive attentive -ula/-la as in Pola ko hayss.ta'He told me to look'.
11.5.2. The familiar style.
FAvtLIAR sryLE: Statement.
The familiar indicative assertive tbrm -ney is used: Poney 'l see it'; Pwass.ney .l saw it';Pokeyss.ney 'l will look at it'; Coh.ney /conney/ 'lt is good'; Cip iney 'lt is a house'. But adjectives
ard the copula otlen take ihe prospective motlitier -ul(q) + the postmotlitier sey, instead: COh,ulq sey
'lt's goot.l!'; Cip ilq sey 'lr's a house'.

"*-11.7.5. Negatives with verbal nouns.
Constructions ofverbal noun + postnominal verb behave like ordinary simple verbs, except in the
tbllowing cases. When the short version of the strong negative is applietl. Ge mos usually occurs
BETWEEN the verbal noun and the postnominal verb in the case of most two-syllable verbal nouns andthe one-syllable verbal noun il 'work'. But in further conversions, the m<1s rry come before the verbal
noun: despite the lack of *m6s sayngkak hanta as such, we hear Kulen kes to mds sayngkak
hamyen, etteh.key! 'You should think of things like that, at least'. For 0re one-syllable verbal iouns
other than il (including free and separable ones) the m0s MUsT precede the verbal noun. Examples:
Group I
il mds hanta (*mris il hantri) 'can't work'
sayngkak mds hanta (rmds sayngkak hanta) 'can't think'
salang mris hanta (*mds salang hanta) 'can't love'
txycrvung mirs hanta ('mds taycwung hantn) 'can't estimate'
Also note: yenghwa kw0kyeng ul m6s hanta =
ul haci mtDs hanta =
haci mOs hanta =
yenghwa lul kwiikyeng mds hanta =
haci mOs hantt 'can't see the movie'
Group 2
mds c€n hanta (*c6n mds hanta) .can't transmit'
mOs cheng hanta (*cheng m6s hanta) .can't invite'
mOs kiim hanta (*k[m mOs hanta) .can't prohibit'
mds w€n hanta [rarel (*w€n mr)s hanta) .can't request'
The simple form is difficult to elicit in some cases, such as mac.i mirs hanta 'can't welcome'
^ mac.i hanta, but it turns up in the adverbialization mac.i mds hay
from
se 'unwillingly'.
to my observalions, an(i) does not appear before a free verbal noun (aan(i) Vly hanta
_-According
+ VIV an(i) hanta = Vll haci onh.nunta) and the short negative tloes not appear at all with adjectival
nouns: *an(i) AN hata, *AN an(i) hata. The Hamkyeng dialect is said to allow the local

"If we leave aside the question forms and the particle+olored sentences (such as $e polite -. yo or
the apperceptive -. kwun), the typical sentence ends in a verbal. A sentence is quite complete, and
even quite usual, with nothing but a verb: Ponta 'lSomeonel looks at [something/someone]',
To the verb we can add almost any number ofadverbial phrases with additional informatioo:
Ayki ponta ' ; the baby is involved
Emeni ponta ' ; the mother is involved'.
Cikum ponta
; now is involved'.
Ayki emeni ponta ' ; the baby, the mother are involved'.
Cikum ayki emeni ponta ' -. ; now, the baby, and the mother are involved'.
The orrler in which we add the additional information is determined by the relative importance we
attach to it: the more important, novel intbrmation, the more startling things less likely to be already'-#
'!:*A Reference Grammar of Korean282 p,rnr tknown, come later. All the following sentences are possible:
Cikum emeni ayki ponta.
Cikum ayki emeni ponta.
Enreni cikum ayki pontl.
Ayki cikum emeni ponta.
Enreni ayki cikum ponta.
Ayki emeni cikum ponta.
None of rhem tells you anytbing explicit about who does the looking or who gets looked at, and
only by knowing the meaning of rhe word cikum do you realize that it could not have those roles. The
woids'cikum, ayki, and emeni are simpty adverbial phrases. Only their individual meanings are
helpful in tleciding which two sould be subject and object: under ncrrmal circumstances ponta takes a
personal sutrject and eirher a personal or an impersonal object, so that if kdng 'balt' were to replace
either 'bahy' or 'morher' it wouhl pretty well resolve tbr the hearer the question of subject and objerx
though there woukl still be the outside chance that a whimsical speaker meant 'the ball looks at the
baby' wherher that mpkes strict sense or not. The word cikum is an atlverb of time, un:rble to take the
role of personal subject or object nor of impersonal object, so it does not lead to ambiguity' Both of
the sentences Emeni ayki ponta and Ayki emeni ponta are ambiguous as to subject and object. Or,
rather, they are DIsTNTEREsTED in the subject/object relationship; all sentences are ambiguous in that
they are disinterestetl in some of the possible intbrmation that could be supplied about a situation.
There is, however, a normal expectation about what the speaker or hearer will likely treat as novel
intbrmation; the object is more likely to be the element close to the verb, so that it is a good guess that
Ayki emeni ponta is intended to mean 'The baby looks at the mother' such a good guess, in fact,
111it many spiakers may not be happy with the notion that the other interpretation ('The NlorHER lools--at the baby') is possible.
Both of the sentences Emeni ayki ponta and Ayki emeni pont! are ambiguous not only withrespect to subject and object, tbr the two nouns could be taken as a constiruent, with the first
adnominal to the seconrl, and that could be made explicit by inserting the particle uy alter the t'irst. So
i
there are several possible translations, depending on how each of the sentences is
Ayki (ka) emeni (lul) ponta.
(l) 'The baby looks at the mother'
Emeni (lul) ayki (ka) ponta.
Emeni (ka) ayki (lul) ponta.
(2) 'The mother looks at the baby'

require more ofrhe siverai participants in a scene to be explicitly stated. In Korean the subject/object""
relitionship is often left unilear, Lven when the meanings of the words themselves do not make the.role playeri obvious. The ambiguity of the subject/object relationship can be resolved by inserting one
or b,ith of rhc appropriate care-maiking particles as sPEctFlcATloH: in Emeni ka ayki ponta or Ayki jg
lul cnpni ponluihe-m.rther is looking at thc child, and in Emeni lul ayki ponll or Ayki ka crneni
pontt the cnild is looking at the mothlr. But if the two nouns ffe next to each other the possibility of
rhe genitive relationship remains: Emeni ayki lul ponta could mean someone looks at the mother's
chilJ, an6 Emeni ayki ka ponta could mean the mother's chitd looks at someone. Mth the explicit
-.d!U
marking of roles for all nouns mentioned, including Emeni uy Byki ( -' ) ponta, the situation is clear.

Thi particles most useful for ctearing up syntactic ambiguity are i/ka (nominative: oftenthe .-.s!

a

yer Jven with particles, ambiguity often continues to be present. That is because in ordinary
.- un/nun ('as tbr , guess what: ') and
speech the common ibcus particles, such as lhe subtluing
'), are mutually exclusive not only with each other but also with
the highlighting -. to ('evin/also
ttre nominitive and accusative particles, so that the tbllowing fully edited sentences are still arnbiguous:

And Emeni to ayki to ponta 1or Ayki to emeni to ponta) is ambiguous in many ways, for when taken---pontl.as a single constituent the structure X to Y to means 'both X and Y (as subject/object)' and itis notpossible to inserr particles thirt would show whether you mean'both mother-and baby lmk at

iit/someonel' or 'ls-omeonel looks at both mother and baby'. The sentences can be
iy specifuing the missing role-player: apeci ka'the tbther (looks at both)'or apeti lul'(both look at)
the tathei'. The strucrurJ X to Y io hania'both X and Ydo'or'does both X and Y is a reduction of
X to n Y io hanta, with etlipsis of the gerund hrko or the conjunctive hamye.
,ltore details on the use of rhe individual particles will be found in the entries of Part II. Noti!'e
that a phrase with un/nun naturally tends to come toward or at lhe beginning of a sentence because, as
implied earlier, the position fanhest back from the verb is the natural place to put information that is
assume<l ro be lacking in novelty. The Korean sentence snowballs, as it were, gaining in vitality and
interest as it buil<ls up to fte uerb. That is in marked contrast with the English sentence, which usually
sers up a subject, spiis the verb out very quickly, and then slowly unwinds, like a clock running down.
or adds hedges and
The inglish sp.uf.. g.s his punch in at the beginning, and then relaxes
reservations, oi in4ulges in afterplay. The Korean builds the tension up, then explodes with his verb
and almost immediately subsides.
From what we have said above, it sounds as though Korean has lree word order tbr the arguments
taken bv the predicate, and that is largety true for many common simplex sentences. But certain kinds
of sentjnces iequire the argumenrs to tbllow a certain order, such as those with multiple subjects or
objecrs dat come tiom unrierlying arlnominal (genitive) relationships, as rlescribed in $t0.6. lt""tanin
l9i5 retlrs to the multiple-subjecisentences ol lapanese as 'multiparous"", claiming that they originate
in nrukiple underlying pretlicitions that have undergone genitivization.) ln adtlition to those, a fcw
other sentence rypes ttaul tixed wortl ortler and do not permit scrambling (Choy Yengsek 1988):
A ka B ka loyntr 'A becomes B'
A ka B ka cdh.ta 'A tinds B nise, A likes B'
A ka B to pointa 'A tooks (seems) to be B'
(C ka) A lul B lo yekinta '(C) considers A to be B' (the order of C ka is irrelevant; it can
appear atier A lul or B kD
To this list we can add sentences with the negative copula:
A ka B ka ani 'ta'A is not B'
Notice rhat while B ka A ka sni 'ta 'B is not A' has the same truth value, it is not saying the same
thing, tirr the perspuctivc is ditlcrent.","[277, 278, 279]"

"1.9. External puuctuation.
Koreans borrow English and Japanese punctuation treely. The standard practices accord, more or
less, with the current American usage. Parentheses, commas, and quotation marks are seen more
frequently than semicolons or colons. Sentences usually end with a period, but question marks and
exclamation points are also frequent, though their usage is not consistent. Korean questions are
typically marked by something specitrc in the sentence, such as the final postmodit'ier yl in -. (ha)nunpARTt 2lA Reference Grammar of Koreanyu, usually spelled as an unanalyzed ending -. (ha)nunya, and the interrogative ending -(su)p.nikka in
-. hap.nikka. For questions so marked there is no need for a question mark, though many writers put
one in, anyway. When the interrogation is otherwise unmarkecl in speech, a rising intonation indicates
a question, and such questions are appropriately wrinen with a question mark: Kim scrsayng? Pap
mek.e? If the question mark is reserved to mark only those questiorui that have a rising intonation, we
can write the distinction that is heard with indeterminates, i.e. words that have both interrogative and
indefinite meanings: Nwu ka woss.ey yo. 'Who is here?'
Nwu ka w:rss.ey yo? 'ls someone here?'
Koreans now ordinarily write both these sentences with a question mark, just as at one time they would
have written them with a period (or no punctuation); the spoken distinction is lost in the writing.
In this book the question mark is used only for sentences with rising intonation. The period is
used at the end of statements and questions with falling intonation, but it is usually omitted when the
sentence is cited as an example with the English translation immediately following. See $2.8 for other
intonations that might be marked.
In some cases, the grammatical analysis used in this book is more detailed than tbat rellected in
the Hankul spelling systems. As a result, there are some word divisions that produce spellings at
variance with tho prescriptions of Korean grammarians, such as -un ya for Hankul -unya, -um ulo for
Hankul -umulo, -um ey for Hankul -umoy. The grammatical lexicon of Pan ll carries most of the
usual Hankul forms with cross references to the spellings I prefer: -unya + -un ya.
In one or two other cases I have chosen to regularize forms that differ from those favored by the
Korean grammarians. I prefer the colloquial -€ as the shape for the infinitive aftet stems ending irt
...aC- (tat.e) rather than the literary/dialect version -a favored by the grammarians, lhough I realize
many younger speakers are tending to model their speech aller the spelling. I prefer the colloquial hsy
as the infinitive of hn- rather than the literary ha.ye favored by grammarians. But the literary forms
are discussed and cross-referenced. Another dilference of opinion, more controversial: I do not

unobtrusively the syllable divisions of the original spelling, which varied considerably from text to
text, or even within a single text. The spaces we write represent grammatical information that is not
directly supplied bythe texts, for they recognized graphic syllables and morphemes but no unit between
those chunks and longer strings, such as sentences. Modern writers usually insert spaces that break up
the Hankul text into phrases, basing the boundaries on likely surface junctures - pauses, or momentary
slowdowns in the articulatory process. The main principles followed are to attach parricles at tho end
of the phrase, just like verb endings, and to keep many complex ending structures as unbroken strings.
At the levels of phrase and morpheme alike people vary in deciding just which complex stnrc$res are

"0.4. Grammatical terms.
You may find the terminology unfamiliar and irksome. lf so, think of the categories in terms of
concrete representations. Should you not tbel comfortable referring to a common form of the verb as
the'gerund-, take that jusr ro mean ""rhe -ko tbrm"" of that verb or, if you prefer, 'the hako form"".
The grammatical categories ot Korean are numerous, diverse, and complexly represented. They cannot
easily be put into a tiame ofreference based on the descriptions ofother languages. But in practice it is
convenient to choose terms thar are sonrewhat t'amiliar, supplemented when necessary by new terms
mrde up by analogy, with the clear understanding that No DIRECT coRREspoNDENcE is intended with
the categories ofother langurges that are given similar names.
The set of names found in this book has grown out of terms used in earlier books; many of them
stem from Elinor Clark Horne antl our teacher Bernard Bloch. One that has troubled many people is
'infinitive"" for the -e ending. Reg;rrdless of the merits of the word itselt, tlre name has become so
widespread in discussions of the grammar of Japanese (where it refers to the -i form, sometimes called
'continuative stem""; that it has surely become the standard. For what is here called the 'summative' I
earlier applied Horne's term 'nominrtive"", but that is bener used in ret'erence to rhe case-marking
function ofthe particle -.i/k:r, and so I have abandoned its use tbr any other purpose. The word
'substantive"" is sometimes used as r general term tbr ""noun"", but here it is narrowed in det'inition to
one of the endings (-unr) thct make the verb inn a tirrrn thlt is used like a noun; orher such forms are
the summative -ki and the 'derivetl noun"" -i. For the -key ending I have changed t}e earlier term
'adverbial"" to 'adverbative"" so that 'adverbial"" can be used to discuss syntacric phenomena only. I
adopt Wagner's term 'purposive"" to retbr to the -ute ending, but what he calls the ""expository"" is here
called the 'sequential"" (the -uni entting), and what he called the'eftbctive' is called the'projective'
(the -tolok ending), so that fre term 'eft'ective' can dcsignate an aspect marker of lUiddle Korean
(:ke,b- or -'eh-). ln speaking of sentence styles I continue to use 'authoritative"" to refer to verb forms
ending in -o/-so (etc.), as a synonym tbr'semitbrmal"", u'lgner's term, which characterizes the style
in broader way.",[13]

"6.0. Fornu: particles.
Particles are words that mark grammatical relationships, focus, emphasis, attitude, and a variety
of emotional meanings. A Korean particle follows the word or phrasd which it is marking, so that the
Korean particles (like those of Japanese and many other languages) may be called PosTPostrtoNs, by
analogy with the prepositions of western languages, such as English. It is often difficult to translate a
given panicle from one language to another, just as it is diftlcult to translate prepositions, which serve
a similar function in English. The translation of a Korean particle will sometimes be a preposition in
English, but it may instead involve word order or the placement of sentence stress, the choice of
definite or indefinite article, and other subtleties that are ditficult to pinpoint.

"2.9. Intonations.
The tbllowing statements about intonation tbllow the analysis in Martin 1954 1= KM). Every
phrase or utterance of more than one syllable has a gradual nondistinctive rise throughout until the
onset of a particular intonation, which occurs near the end of the phrase and in conjunction with a
pause. The meaning of statement, question, suggestion, and command are sometimes carried (in whole
or in pan) by tlre intonation, but often these meanings are wholly or partly expressed by morphs in the
ending of the verb tirrm.
Seven intonations are recognized for Seoul speech:
l. PERIoD intonation (.): a fall, beginning on the third, second, or last syllable from the end ofthe
sentence (if on the last syllable this intonrtion is homophonous with 4).
2. coMMA intonation (,); a rise on the last syllable of a phrase.
3. QUEsrtoN-MARK intonation (?): a rise on the third, second, or last syllable from the end of the
sentence (if on the last syllable the intonation is homophonous with 2).
4. ExcLANrATroN-potNT intonation (!): a quick tall on the last syllable of the sentence, often
accompanied by a voice qualitier of overlouclness.
5. DoUBLE euEsTtoN-trrARK intonation (??): a dip on the third, second, or last syllable ftom the
end of the sentence (homophonous with 7 when on the last syllable).",[45]
"3.2. Parts ofspecch.
ln tlris book all the inflected words are calletl venns. There are, to be sure, many subclasses, but
they share the chlracteristic of being stems that require the attachment of one ottthe int'lectional
endings in order to serve as a free word. The unint'lected wortls divide into two broad categories called
NouNs and PARTICLES. The characteristic of particles, which are typically quite short, is that they
occur as the last member of a eunese, or ari part of a string that can be treatetl as the last member. In
pronunciation they are attached to the last word of the phrase: a noun or a verb tbrm or some other
particle. These charatteristics they share with forms of the copula (i-), a seconrlary subclass of verb.
Typically, particles occur after nouns, but some of them also are attached to verb forms, not only those
forms which often serve as the head of a nominal phrase (as tloes haki 'doing') or an adverbial phrase
(as does hakey 'so as to do') but also tbrms which often stand as the head of a verbal phrase, such as
hay 'does'. Particles that are cAsE M.\RKERs specify va.lences that certain other languages express
through affires or prepositions; coNTExruAL particles (delimiters and partictes of focus) convey
information carried in many other langulges by anicles, adverbs, prosodic elements, or worrl order.
lvfany of the particles originated as bound nouns or verb forms.
The verb ending is considered to be in construction only with its stem. The particle, on rhe other
hand, is taken to be in construction with the entire phrase, which may end in a noun, a verb form, or
one or more prior-attached particles. In a string of particles, the constituents are assumed to peel off
from the right, even when two (such as ey se) form a frequent collocation.",[90]

adjectives: kolu- 'is even' or 'makes it even', pet- '(tooth) is prot*jing' or .it srietches out; stretchesit out', ... . (See Appendix l.)
The intransitive verbs iss- 'stay; exisr. be located; have'. ips- 'not exist; not have', anrl tense

anrl Ops.nun :ue more common than the simple modifiers iss,un ,rn.t €ps.un, which they traue targeiy
replaced in standard speech. (But the simple morJifiers are tbund in Phyengrn; see pan II.) Th;
preceding description is inadequate for modern Seoul speech lrYi Tongcay ilso;, *nicn diftbrentiates
iss-1 'stay' tiom iss- (the other meanings) and treats it as a regular intransitive verb thar shares most
but not all of ia paradiqmatic tbrms with the quasi-processive verb. To reconcile the rwo descriptions,
we might suggest that there are speakers, or at least wrirers, who replace iss.nunla 'rtuys' *ith the
shoner iss.ta (which also has the other meanings), perhaps obligatorily in cenain situations, such as
qlotations, and optionally in others, such as negatives. For ""aps- the tvtK texts attest both the modifier
eP sltn and (more often) the processive..moditler 'ep'non; the predication can be negativized u 'ep'ti
a'ni'ho-, but I have not tbund *a'ni ""eps-. For the stem is/il- rhe modit'ier is isin, the p.orp..iiu.
moditier is isil(q); the processive modit'ier is is.non antt its modulated form is is'nwon. The predication
can be negativized as js'rj a'ni ""ho-, but I have not tbund (""!*)a'ni is(i)-. Examples of rhe Middle
Korean forms will be tbund under their entries in part II.
The past is simply -ess.ta and the future -keyss.la, irrespective of whether the stem is processive or
descriptive. These stems and markers seem to lack any use of the subjunctive tbrms, the intentive, or
the purposive, except tbr iss- itself in the meaning 'stay', and they ue not common even tbr it. Theso
verbs and bound auxiliaries (the tense markers) can be called quasi-processive in their behavior; we
will label them quasi-verbs intransitive (qvi). Ceng Insung 1960:262-3 neatly describes iss- as 'a verb
that lacks the form 'iss.nunta"" @ut that is not true of modern Seoul speechi and Eps- as 'an adjective
that has the extra tbrm €ps.nun"". He says thar the honoritic ky6ysi- is like iss-, yet I tinrl th;r both
kyeysita and kyGysinla are used fbr the plain present. The stem eps- occurs in the construcrion -e
cinta'gets to bel, normally limited to adjective stems though rlere are a fbw cases with inrransitive
processive verbs (see lhe entry in Part II); *iss.e cinta does nor occur. Notice that eps- hrs the derived
adverb form cps.i (< ""ap'si)'wirhout', but (r)iss.i (*i'si)'wirh'occurs only in <tialects (p. 5g.l).
The stem iss- is panicularly tricky; see p. 319 for evidence that it should be treated as ftree
homonyms 'stays', 'is', and 'has'. ln the meaning 'is' and 'has', the appropriate auxiliary tbr such
nuslear tbsus conversions ru V1-ki nun ha- = Vr-ki nun V1- is the descriptive hata (with the moditier
han and not hsnun), but in the meaning 'stays' the processive hanta (wirh rhe modifier hanun) is
called tbr: Cip ey iss.ula 'ni-kka iss.ki nun hanta m:rn un ku siilam i olq ka? 'Toltl to stay home, I
do stay home but will he come?'; Ku palam-cayngi ka cip ey kakkum iss.ki to hanun kcs ul kkwum
ey to rndllass.ta 'l didn't even dream that playboy would stay home every now antl then, too'.
Japanese, on the other hand, uses the auxiliary_suru (its counterpan of hanta) t:or a'r- ,be' and .have'
as well as for [wlo'r- or [wli-'stay': a.ril[wlo'ri wa suru.
A CAUSATIVE verb (vc) is a transitive verb which is a member of a pair of stems that lre related
in shape. The other member of the pair is active: either transitive or iniransitive, anrl il inrransitive
either processive or descriptive, The causative stem ditlbrs from rhe active stem by the sunixing of a
causative tbrmative, which has several ditlbrent shapes ($7.4). Such verbs are LExicAL causatives tha!

An AUXILIARY verb (aux) is used in close juxtlposition with some other verb, which is usually in
the intinitive (-Bat or geruntl (-ko) tbrm. The auxiliary convcys l somcwhat different meaning t'rom
what its stem carries when it stands as u independcnt vcrb, if thc sten crn so be used. There are
processive auxiliaries (= auxiliary verirs proper) antl rlescriptive auxiliaries (= auxiliary adjectives).

"5.3.1. Quasi-adnouns.
Some of the Chinese nouns which have the earmarks of tteedom, being of two or more syllables,
are nonetheless restricted to positions modi$ing a noun or noun phrase, and occasional examples in
other positions are to be dismissed as awkward at best. Among these 'quasi-adnouns"" are the det'ectiveverbal nouns ($5.6.2) that have only the modifier form: tiiymo han 'prominent', miimo hrn
'celebrated', ... . For'unique'we finrl both yuil htn and yuil uy (as in - mokcek'unique goal'); also
yuil mui han (less commonly yuil mui uy) 'unique and unmatched'.
.1SPARTI I5IA Reference Grammar of Korean
Other quzsi-adnouns are listed below in several groups:
(l ) Qursi-adnouns with uypulhwu uy 'undying, immonal'
pulphay uy'unvanquished, unconquerable'
cisang uy 'supreme, sublime'
celqsey uy 'peerless'micung-yu uy'unprecedented'
pul.yo pulkwul uy (? pul.yo uy,
? pulkwul uy)'indomitable'
pulka-pun uy'indivisible'(2) Qu:si-adnouns without uykwukcey (miincey) 'international (prohlems)' kanay ftongep)'domestic (industry)'
nyelyu (cak.ka) 'woman (writer)'
wensi (siihoy)'primitive (society)'
coki (chilyo)'early (treatment)'
ilqtay (cangkwan) 'grand (sight)'
(3) The bound postnoun cek '-ic' produces compounds which are somewhat like quasi-adnouns that
do not take uy, but they can also occur:
betbre ulo, as in kwshsktek ulo 'scientitically';before forms of the copula especially the modit'ier, as in kwahak-cek (in) thAyto 'a scientiflic
aftitude' and thiyto ka kwahak<ek ita 'has a scientific anitude';
before the nominative marker i/ka when tbllowed by a negativized copula expression: th6yto ka
kwuhak-cek i ani 'ta 'does not have a scienlitic attitudd'.
(,1) The bound postnoun sling '--wise, with respect to' (the basic vowel length of the morpheme is
usually suppressed when it functions this way) creates sompounds that are often used like adnouns, but
they may be separated ttorn dre morliticd noun by the copula moditier in or (more commonly) by the
particlc uy, as in I ke n' kycngccy-snng (uy) mincey 'la ko polq swu iss.ta 'This can be looked at as
a question relevant to economics'. (Contrast the behavior of cek '-.ic', which never occurs with uy.)
The compounds also occur before various particles, but usually the particles are present because they
are required by later elements ofthe sentence. The sing compounds, unlike the cek compounds, do not
occur as predicate complement with -. ita 'it is - ', nor with most conversions of the copula other than
the adnominal in (and substitution by uy is more common) and such adverbial conversions as ina and
the negative ani 'la. See the entry in Pan II tbr examples.","[150, 151]"

A t'ew stems have two intinitive forms: the normal one is tbrmed as expected, the special one is
used only betbre the command particle la. Do not confuse this word with the subjunctive anenliveending -ula/-la, which is attached directly to the stcm and produces a plain command used only in
quotaiiue constructions or literary tbrms. The two are indeed etymologically related, though not quite
not as directly as the shapes seem to suggest. Notice the exclamatory use of adjective infinitive + la
and see $e historical remarks in the entries of Pan II. For vowel sterns that end in ey, oy, ay, or a the
rwo command structures will sound identical: s€y(e) la, sOyla 'count!'; oy(e) la (spelled ""wayla' in the
Hankul orrhography, Cr $e.+;, Oyta 'memorize!'; ntry la, nlyla 'pay!'; sa la, sala 'buy!'. But for theother stems a difference is heard: mek.e la, mek.ula 'eat!'; nol.a la, n0lla 'play!'; kie la, kila
'crawl!'; ttwie la, ttwila 'jumpl'; cwue la, cwula 'give!'; sse la, ssula 'write!', In Seoul the forrrs for

of the intinitivi syllable, and rhe string wirh the panicle is considered by the grammarians to be an
unanalyzed enrting (ka-Xela, o-nc-la, iss-kela). There may be other stems that belong to this class.

€-I 1.3. Style conversions.
Koreans speak in diftirent sryLEs dcpending on the person with whom they are talking. The style
chosen shows something ahout the social rapport which the speaker t'eels to exist between himself and
the person he is addressing. The stylization of a sentence dittbrs, of course, ttom the insenion of the
honoritic marker -usi-/-si-, in thlt the verbs containing the honoritic show a special detbrence toward
the suBJEcT of the verb tbrm, and that subject may or may not be the same as thc person to whom one
is speaking. Honorit'ic t'urms occur in eLu styles of speech. lf you are talking to a chikl about his

"The last three cases (42, 43,44) are somewhat anomalous. Apparently they are always in close
juncture with the preceding phrase, so they are treated by most Korean dictionaries as particles rather
than, say, as bound nouns or adverbs. Compare the note on kot in Part II.
Nouns of relative location, such as wi 'atop, above', aluy 'below', anrl yeph 'beside', are not
treated as particles. ln chayk-sang wi ey 'on top of the desk' only the ey is a particle, and the
preceding erpression is Noux + NouN for two reasons:
(l) we can say just wi ey 'on top' without a preceding noun (but of course 'on top' implies 'on top
of soMETHlNc'), and wi occurs in other positions as a I'ree noun, though not modified by an adnoun or
verb modifier (so that in ku wi 'on top of that'ku is a noun, as it is in ku man Just that');
(2) 'above me' is nay wi ey not 'na wi ey. The same is true of yeph (ey) 'beside': nay yeph (ey)
'beside me'shows that yeph is a noun even though tangsinq yeph 'beside you' anrl wuli yeph 'besirle
us' might leave one wondering whether it is not a postnoun or particle. There are dialects (such as that
of Taykwu) in which na yeph, na wi, etc., are used insteld of the tbrms with nay, but speakers of
tlrose dialects say n:l chayk tbr'my book'. For such dialects, the t'act that wi and yeph can begin a
sentence is suft'icient criterion to establish that they are n()t postnouns or particles. Nouns of relative
location can be thought of as distilled tiom a kind of semlntic predication that locates one noun withA Reference Grammar of KoreanPARrr 197rospect to rnother. Other such nouns: rn 'inside' (something rather empty), sdk '(deep) inside'
(sr-rnrething rather full). kawunley 'inside; between, among', sai 'between, among; midst, during',
cwung 'midst, among', cwuwi 'around (the periphery of)', kyeth 'beside, in the vicinity of', mith
'(at) the base/bottom of; beneath', aph'in front of; (= 6.n; before, ahead of', twi.behind; (= hw[)
after, later than', ... . By their meaning ('between, among') some of these words locate a noun with
respect to two or more other nouns.
Moreover each of the particles listed as occurring with nouns is sometimes preceded by at Ieast
one other member of the same list. That is the ultimate distributional fact that determines the list.","[196, 197]"
"With certain intransitive verbs and verbal nouns, it is possible to have two or more indirect
ohjects that retlect a genitive (whole-part) relationship: Nay ka Yenghuy eykey ima ey Oyn ccok ey
khisu hayss.ta 'l kissed Yenghuy on the left side of the tbreheatl' (Cr Kim Yengcwu 1989:a62).
On double nominrtives and accusatives see also negative conversions ($t1.7) and nominalizations($11.8). And compare $10.8.1. There are some good examples ard pertinent comments in Kim
Payklyen 1960, who characterizes five kinds of multiple adjunct:(l) The second subject or object forms a construction to which the first stands in a larger
