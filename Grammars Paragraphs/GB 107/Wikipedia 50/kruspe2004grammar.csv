derived transitive means 'be shy (of s.th.)'. The use of this verb in a negative
imperative is illustrated by (347), in which directions are given by an uncle to
encourage a child to walk past someone he fears. The first verb, which is
intransitive, is in the positive imperative, the second is a negative transitive

The verb and addressee may be elided, in which case the imperative enclitics or
the particle may follow the imperative negator. The enclitics and the particle are
never used in the formation of the negative imperative when the verb is present. The
absence of the particles is not ungrammatical, but speakers judge their inclusion to
be better in a pragmatic sense.

"10 Basic clausesThis chapter explores basic clauses. In the first section, §10.1, non-verbal clauses are
described. In §10.2 the irrealis constructions are discussed. The irrealis is used to
express epistemic and deontic modalities, however the category is only expressed
morphologically for transitive clauses. Before turning to the various non-declarative
clause types, the modifiers of the simple clause are described in §10.3. Sections 10.4
to 10.6 discuss negation, the interrogative clause and the imperative clause,
respectively. The markedness of relations holding between certain categories in the
grammar is evident in the imperative construction (§10.6): transitivity is
distinguished in the negative imperative, but not in the positive imperative. The
morpheme is the irrealis proclitic ma= 'iRR(ealis)' introduced in §10.2, a category
which is only expressed morphologically for transitive clauses.","[296, 297]"
"The negative marker, beh 'NO' can be included in a response. In agreeing with the
negative question in (293), and the negative portion in (287) above, the external
negator beh 'NO' is used along with an internally negated clause.

The imperative is also distinguished from the declarative by the optional presence
of enclitic illocutionary particles - the clitics =ce? 'IMP/, =jia 'IMP2' - and the
phrase na? yandeh 4 IMP 3 \ or the negative imperative marker boy 'NEG:IMP' (312),33210 Basic clausesin combination with heavier final stress of the clause and a rising clause-final
intonation pattern. The final point is important where there is no overt marking of
the imperative.
The two enclitics occur frequently and appear to be freely interchangeable
(310M311). These are not solely imperative clitics; they also function as discourse
clitics (§13.3.1 and §13.3.3). In the positive imperative the enclitic attaches to the
verb; in the negative to the negator.

"10.4 Negation
There are four basic negative operators in Semelai: the propostional negator da?
'NEG' (§10.4.1), the two metalinguistic negators beh 'NO' (10.4.2.1), b?en 'NOT'
(10.4.2.2)6 and the imperative negator boy 'NEG:IMP'. Although the negators
discussed here function in different domains, it is on account of their functional
commonality that the first three are discussed together in this section. The
imperative negator is discussed in (§10.6.3). Expressions of negative attitude are
described in §13.2.",[344]
"10.5.1 Polar interrogatives
Polar interrogatives are those that seek an expression of affirmation or negation of
the truth of the questioned proposition. The response sought to a polar interrogative
is either an affirmation or negation of the proposition. There are no words for 'yes'
and 'no' in the interrogative context. This is achieved by means of an echo system,
i.e. the partial repetition of the predicate. A sub-type is the alternative interrogative
(Sadock and Zwicky 1985), which provides a list of constituents, or a proposition
and its negation, to which the respondent must make a choice. There are three
interrogative morphemes associated with polar interrogatives: tah ' Q \ expressing
doubt, 'who knows', 'maybe' (§10.5.1.1); kah 'ALT' expressing possible alternatives
andbeh 'NO' the external negator meaning 'or not?' (§10.5.1.2).
10.5.1.1 Intonation interrogatives
Any declarative clause may become a question by using rising intonation over the
relevant constituent. In the first example it is over the verb ?ris 'to live':
(275)?ma?bapa? ?ris?
parents
be.alive
Are your parents alive?",[353]
"The occurrence of this form in a transitive negative imperative construction confirms
the increased valence of the derived form. Compare the negative imperative of the
underived form of the verb in (110) with the transitive negative imperative form of
(111).
(110)boy
yr>r!
NEG:IMP
ascend
Don't go up (there)!",[163]
"The form of the positive imperative is the same regardless of the transitivity of the
clause, unlike the negative imperative where a distinction is made (§10.2.2). This is
exemplified with an intransitive clause in (318) and a transitive clause with an O in
(319).
(318)""?yot=cd?!""bapa?khler)return=IMP2fatherQUOTE""Come (home)!"" the father said.

"32010 Basic clausesSentence-external negation may be paraphrased as, The sentence S is not true'
(Horn 1985: 143). It denies the truth of the statement S that has been either uttered
or implied previously. It is used to REJECT S or its implicata (Horn 1985: 153).
In Semelai, the distinction between internal and external negation is formally
marked by different morphemes, unlike English where 'not' serves both functions.
A further distinction is made on the basis of the clause type: the negator beh 'NO' is
associated primarily with verbal clauses (§10.4.2.1), and b?en ' N O T ' with
non-verbal clauses (§10.4.2.2).
An alternative analysis here is that beh 'NO' is simply an interjection 'no', and
that interjections normally express external negation. For instance the English 'no'
and 'not' exhibit comparable patterning. However, the following examples, where
beh 'NO' functions alone without the internal negator da?, clearly show the
distinction between the two forms.

"10.6.3 The negative imperative
The imperative negator is boy 'NEG:IMP' 'refrain from V (§10.4.3). The form of the
negative imperative clause is dependent on whether the verb is transitive or
intransitive. The intransitive form consists of boy 'NEG.IMP' and the verb
(§10.6.3.1). The transitive imperative is formed by the negative imperative and a
verb bearing the irrealis proclitic ma= 'IRR' (§10.6.3.2), or by a declarative clause
(§10.6.3.3). People on familiar terms use the first form; the second is used where the
addressee is non-familiar (§10.6.3.3).
The negator is pre-verbal, but may stand alone if the verb is elided (337), but it
usually hosts either =ca? 'IMPI' or =jia *IMP2\ or is followed by na? yandeh 'IMP3':
(336)toyna?.yandeh!",[364]
"As we saw above with mandehmoh, the ignorative is rare other than in negative or
free-choice contexts.
When the negative indefinite meaning 'nothing' is required, the ignorative is used
in a negated existential clause. Either mande ~ mande-mande '(RDP)-what' may be
used.

"35611 Complex clausesThe transitive verb of non-permissive complements must be marked for the irrealis
with the proclitic ma= 'IRR'. 4 This proclitic is associated with deontic modality and
is also used to form the negative imperative of transitive clauses (§10.6). Effectively
the substitution of a non-permissive main clause by the negative imperative marker
boy 'NEG:IMP' yields a negative imperative clause. With this predicate type, mood
marking in the COMP is an obligatory structural requirement and the irrealis
proclitic is never interchangeable with the agent proclitic as it is in the Desiderative
type (§11.2.3) below.5 As a result, it is treated here as a reduced complement type,
despite the presence of the irrealis proclitic.

"6.2.7Distinctions in the ignorative classTable 6.2 sets out the basic ontological categories and the forms used across the
range of contexts. As demonstrated, for some categories the basic
interrogative-based lexeme is multifunctional,5 and the majority of the range of
ignorative functions are expressed by a single lexical item per category, e.g. h5n
WHERE, i.e. 'where; somewhere' (§6.2.5). For others, different lexical items and
strategies are employed across the range, with the interrogative and generic noun
sharing the functional load. For example, the category of PERSON is expressed in the
following ways: by an interrogative kadeh 'who'; an indefinite pronoun sma?
(person)/ko= (3UA) 'someone'; in negative contexts, by a negative pronoun da? da?
sma? (NEG EXIST person) 'no-one', and by a free choice pronoun bororj-kadeh (any
who) 'whoever', (§6.2.4).
The categories of PROPERTY and REASON shown in Table 6.2 share the same form,
but are distinguished by differing syntactic contexts (§6.2.2). The ontological
category of MANNER is expressed by a complex ignorative, hon-mande 'in what
manner, how', derived from a compound of the basic terms for PLACE and THING.
The shaded areas in the table indicate the lack of a form for the particular category.",[204]

"10.5.1.2 Alternative interrogatives
There are two alternative interrogative particles: kah 'ALT' is used for NPs and beh

the latter is elliptical, containing only the affirmative proposition and a tag.
i. kah 'ALT' The scope of kah 'ALT' is limited to the constituent it follows, kah
expresses a choice of two or more possible alternatives, and is often used where two
NPs are juxtaposed in an alternative relationship, 'is it A, or is it B?' It is repeated
after each constituent, kah is a borrowing from Malay kah, a general interrogative

"10.6 Imperatives
The imperative refers to a sentence used to express a command. The imperative in
Semelai is used to offer suggestions, invitations or requests, and in the negative,
warnings. It would be misleading to characterise the imperative as either an order or
command as this would require the compliance of the addressee. The speaker
presents a proposition for the addressee to act upon. In an egalitarian-type society
like that of the Semelai the type of authority required to achieve this does not exist
between individuals at any level of social interaction, even between an adult and a
child.",[359]
"1004 Word classesForms like mande 'why' and h5n 'where', also function as indefinite pronouns
(§6.2.1), either alone, or in compounds, e.g. bDrprj-hon (thing-place) 'somewhere'.
Other categories are expressed by generic nouns, e.g. the generic noun for 'person'
sma? is 'anyone', and in negative existential clauses 'no-one'.","[127, 128]"
"10.2.3 Deontic modality
One of the features of the irrealis is its occurrence in clauses associated with
statements expressing deontic modality. The irrealis is used in the following four
instances:
a) to convey negative transitive imperatives;
b) to deny permission;
c) to state prohibitions;
d) to express lack of obligation.",[321]
"Two free-choice pronouns take the form of a compound combining the lexeme
bDrDrj 'thing' and PLACE h5n, bDrorj-hon 'whereever', and with 'person'
borDrj-kadeh 'whoever'. bt>rt>rj is from the Malay barang 'things in general', as
noted above. The compound appears to represent a caique of an archaic form of
question words in Malay, e.g. barang apa 'whatever', barang siapa 'whoever', but
which are no longer common, at least in the standard variety of Malay (Mintz 1994:
118).
There are no distinct negative pronoun forms, this function being achieved by
placing an ignorative in a negated existential construction:

EXISTFinally, it should be noted that generic nouns do not function in the free-choice
category, and they tend to be found in negative contexts, see also Haspelmath (1997:
182-3).
We will now turn to an examination of the individual types from Tables 6.2 and
6.3. The following description is organised around the basic ontological categories
outlined in the introductory section above, taking the main interrogative function as6.2 Ignoratives179the starting point, and then examining the manner in which the range of indefinite
functions is expressed.
Although the discussion of interrogative pronouns precedes the indefinite
pronouns, their function in the interrogative clause is but one of these functions, and
while it is the most basic and accessible function, it should not necessarily be
considered primary. Note that cross-linguistically, indefinite pronouns tend to be the
more marked category relative to the forms used in the interrogative function
(Haspelmath 1997: 27), see §6.2.1.2 above.","[206, 207]"

statement; ?ec to express mild opposition. Note the similarity of ?ec to ?es which is
used as a gentle alternative to utterances containing boy 'NEG:IMP', the imperative
negator (§10.6.3), especially when addressing a child.

"29410 Basic clausesAll cases involve a transitive verb embedded under a negator, either the
imperative negator boy 'NEG:IMP' (§10.2.3.1), or the declarative negator da? 'NEG'
and the modal or matrix verb (§§10.2.3.2-3).
Negative imperatives, denials of permission and statements of obligation should
be regarded as representing advisable or precautionary actions, which if followed
will prevent an adverse consequence affecting the addressee. This act has to be
balanced against the belief that fulfilment of desire is tantamount to maintaining
good health; wanting puts a person at risk of falling ill and illness is associated with
soul loss. As a result, there is an apprehension on the speaker's part toward
preventing someone from what they intend to do, or are in fact doing, for the
speaker cannot judge the inner state of the addressee. This argument leads back to
the epistemic function of ma= 'IRR' in the earlier discussion in §10.2.2. In all four
types, the speaker attempts to move an addressee to action by imposing a condition
of obligation. It must be understood, as expressed in §10.6, that in terms of the
organisation of Semelai society the authority to command is relatively weak. A brief
introduction of each type is provided below, but the main discussion is found in
§10.6.
10.2.3.1 The negative transitive imperative
The clitic ma= 'IRR' is used to form the familiar form of the negative imperative of
the active transitive verb. The irrealis is not used when the directive is aimed at
someone with whom the speaker is not on familiar terms. A full discussion of the
imperative can be found in §10.6.3.2.

"13.3.2 Speaker conclusion =svn 'sc'
As with =cd? 'EM', it is difficult to assign a function to =son 'sc', although a
characterisation of the clitic would suggest that it is used primarily in relation to
background information, and the deduction or drawing to a conclusion in terms of
the narrator's or speaker's belief or opinion: 'due to the event or state X, I draw the
conclusion Y \ It is glossed 'sc' 'speaker conclusion' and is translated as 'evidently'
or 'naturally'.
=sDn 'sc' was never observed in materials obtained through direct elicitation. It
occurs infrequently; in a rough count in a selection of two traditional narrative texts
from one speaker the following rates of occurrences were recorded: 13 out of 112
clauses in the first text and 1 from 130 clauses in the second. A general description
of the distribution and functions of =SDII 'SC' is set out below in §§13.3.2.1-2.

constituent in the clause, other than the discourse connectives in c) below. Possible
hosts are: a) a predicator; b) an NP; c) the discourse connectives: ?le?le? 'then' and
sampay 'so'; d) negative and affirmative lexemes, or e) the temporal clause
connective kna? 'it happened that when ...' and jadi? 'when'.
Some examples and further comments on the hosts listed above are presented
below.
a) The enclitic only attaches to main verbs; it is never found in dependent clauses.
The verb may host the irrealis proclitic (51).",[442]
"10.6.1 Formal features of an imperative clause
The form of the imperative depends on the transitivity of the clause: the positive
imperative has one form (§10.6.2); whilst the negative imperative has two forms,
one for intransitive clauses (§10.6.3.1) and one for transitive clauses (§10.6.3.2).
In the imperative construction, pronominals are in the free form, indicating in the
transitive clause that they are not attached to the verb, but function as vocatives.
They occur either pre- or post-verbally (307)-(308). The pronominal representing
the addressee is the second person singular or plural, kD '2f(amiliar)\ ji *2
non-familiar' or je=?en '2=AUG\
(307)swak,
walk
Don't go, you!boyNEGHMPko!
2fOther vocatives are names, nick-names and address terms (396). All vocatives,
regardless of their form, are optional.

"With the next negative imperative in the text, he reverts to using the irrealis:
(349)boyma=p-krja?!",[366]
"The response is based on the clause nucleus rather than the tag (§10.5.1.3). Although
the question presents two propositions to the respondent, there is an element of bias
in interrogatives of this type, in that the interrogator appears to expect a negative
response.

"12.2 The syntax of expressives
Expressives function in an adjunct-like manner, syntactically independent of the
associated constituent (whether clause or phrase), hence their treatment here rather
than in previous chapters on clausal syntax. Expressives are defined syntactically by
the following features:
•
They only occur in relation to positive declarative clauses.4
•
They cannot be negated, quantified, or modified. This distinguishes them
from manner adverbials with which they could otherwise be confused.
•
Expressives are usually, though not always, distinguished by an intonation
break separating them from the constituent which precedes or follows. This is
4The inadmissability of expressives in negated clauses is attested cross-linguistically in genetically
and areally unrelated languages such as the African language Chadic and the Austronesian language
Sundanese. In Korean, expressives can only occur with metalinguistic negation indicating the
inappropriate use of an expressive (Diffloth 1972: 446).",[427]

construction, illustrated in (124)-(125) (§5.5.1.2), which implies a source of the
emotion, but where the outward manifestation of the fear is not directed externally.",[165]

interesting contrast to the Malay negators tidak and bukan, which apply to
descriptive rather than metalinguistic negation.
There are similarities between the Semelai b?en and the Malay negator bukan.
Bukan is used to negate nouns and noun phrases. Bukan can be used to negate verbs
or adjectives where it relates not only to the verb or negative, but the implications
associated with the statement as well. Bukan can be used to negate prepositional
phrases where the noun is being negated rather than the verb associated with the
prepositional phrase. Examples of a comparative situation are found in (268)-(269).

beh 'NO' may be used with a clause negated by da? 'NEG', as we have seen in the
examples above, or it can occur in relation to a clause containing a positive
assertion. The presence of the external negator does not affect the truth value of the
accompanying proposition. The fact that beh 'NO' does not negate the clause is
evidence of its external nature, and clearly illustrates that it does not overlap with
the internal negator da? 'NEG'. In the following examples beh occurs in predicates
which do not contain the negator da?, but precedes an affirmative clause, verbal
(265)-(266), or non-verbal (267), to negate or contradict that which has been stated
or implied in the previous discourse. Here, beh 'NO' has the same function as with
the negated clauses above.

expresses the category PROPERTY, 'what sort of and also REASON 'because of what'.
The choice between these interpretations is dependent on the context. The
distinction is apparent in its syntactic distribution: in its PROPERTY function mande
exhibits the syntactic distribution of the referent, e.g. as the adnominal constituent in1826 Pronouns: personal, ignorative, and demonstrativean associative phrase (47), whilst in the REASON function it is always clause-initial,
an adjunct to the proposition (48).

This is the rendering of a negative imperative, a direct statement, into an indirect or reported one:
boy ma=tlDrj (NEG:IMP lRR=grab) 'Don't (you) grab (it)!' as opposed to (88). Deontic force is
maintained. A similar construction to this is the intransitive predicate da? sot (NEG permit) 'not
allowed (to)'.",[384]

"3.3.2Irrealisma= 'IRR'The proclitic ma = 'IRR' occurs primarily in conjunction with transitive verbs to mark
the irrealis in a range of clause types (§10.2). It is mutually exclusive with the
pronominal proclitic, the presence of ma= 'IRR' being associated with the
suppression of the A in the clause. Unlike the proclitic, it does not coreference an
external NP: ma=V ((hn=)O).
ma= has the same range of distribution as the pronominal proclitics, cliticising to
the initial verbal constituent of the verbal word (§5.5.2) as in the negative imperative
clause in (26).

"Any other information that the speaker wishes to include, like the O in (311), or the

negative imperative:
