functions as the nominal object of the verb. A property of this type of object, as was
illustrated in (147), is that it can be relativised. This does not apply to to ora in (151a), as
illustrated in the two forms in (152), which are unacceptable. In other words, to ora is not a
nominal constituent, but rather an adverbial constituent like kait ‘near’ in (148a) and u
‘above’ in (149).

other combinations of adverbials, the scope of the clause-final adverbial is over the entire
clause, and the scope of the pre-final adverbial does not include the final adverbial. A
contrast is given in example (154): forms like (154b) do occur, but they are very marked.

There are two ways to express negation, namely with the clausal negator fe and with its
predicative counterpart m-fe. These negators are discussed in §6.9.1 and §6.9.2. In §6.9.3, I
will illustrate that it is not always possible to make a clear distinction between fe and m-fe.
Section 6.9.4 discusses negation of clauses involving adverbial modifiers. I will show how
the scope of the negator can be influenced by varying the order of the negator and the
adverbial in a clause. Some examples of frequently used combinations of negators and
adverbials, such as fe fares ‘not yet’ and m-fe fi-t-o ‘if this is not the case’ are also
discussed. Finally, in §6.9.5 I will present some other forms which semantically express
negation, namely kayie and peroh.
6.9.1 Clausal negator fe
The clausal negator fe occurs in clause-final position, but see (162). Some examples:
(157)om m-ais
fe
rain 3U-descend NEG
‘It is not raining.’(158)ana m-asah fe
3P 3U-laugh NEG
‘They do not laugh.’(159)ait y-amo Kumurkek fe
3M 3M-go Kumurkek NEG
1. ‘He does not go to Kumurkek.’
2. ‘He goes, but not to Kumurkek.’(160)ait y-e
pitis
fe
3M 3M-give money NEG
1. ‘He does not give money.’
2. ‘He gives something, but not money.’In these examples, the unmarked interpretation is where the verb is negated, that is
reading 1. This is in accordance with the typological pattern of SVO-languages, in which
the negative marker is usually a verbal operator rather than a sentential one (cf. Givón
1984:336). However, an interpretation in which only the object is negated (reading 2) is
also common. If a negated sentence allows more than one interpretation, there are two
ways to resolve this ambiguity: one is to use emphasis, as in example (161), and the other
is to add an extra clause which indicates which constituent is to be negated, as in (162):
(161)ait y-e
pítis

3M 3M-give money NEG
‘He does not give money (but something else).’(162)ana m-e

a speaker hesitates:

pa mati
s-au
m-e
u
person eh? area.ADV-far-U eh? and.then one-3U 3u-return again
‘The men, the thing uh (she is confused), and then once, she returned.’The adverb peroh ‘wrong’ can also be analysed as an interjection, that is it does not
have a clear relation to the rest of the sentence, and it is surrounded by intonational pauses.
However, due to its semantic content, it is discussed in §4.7.5 on negators, and in §6.9.5
under the heading ‘other semantic negatives’.
One particle, glossed ‘PART’, has been defined, namely the element -re in wo-re and
fi-re. Wo-re is a locative adverbial clause marker, while fi-re is a manner adverbial clause
marker. The function and meaning of -re are unclear. An example is:
(366)m-hu wo-re
rae ø-skie spiah
3U-stay location.GEN-PART man ø-build hut
‘They stay where the people built a hut.’For a discussion on locative and manner adverbial clauses, see §9.2.2 and §9.2.3
respectively.","[143, 144]"
"174Chapter 66.9.5 Other semantic negatives
The negators peroh ‘wrong’ and kayie ‘it is not’, introduced in §4.7.5, can semantically
negate an assertion. In the following examples, kayie ‘negates’ an NP. Intonationally, it
belongs to the NP, and it is followed by a pause:
(195)Koru kayiè / m-tut m-ama m-hu fte tuoh Pamai
Koru not
3U-all 3U-come 3U-stay area place Pamai
‘It was not Koru (where they went), they all came and lived at an area
of the place Pamai.’(196)Anton kayiè / Atafonit m-anes

m-air me-t-o
irontree 3U-foot PRESTT-near-U
‘Not Anton, Atafonit, the old one, is the one who died at the foot of the
ironwood tree.’
The negator peroh is preceded by sentence-final intonation of the previous sentence and
a pause, and followed by yet another pause. Syntactically then, it is an interjection.34 The
assertion that precedes peroh is the one that is denied. Some examples appear below. As
indicated, in example (197), the speakers of each sentence are different people, that is, the
speaker of the second sentence corrects the speaker of the first sentence.

Interrogation is discussed in the next chapter.
34The clause1756.10 Clausal determiner
The form fo (but not to and no) can function as a clausal determiner. In this function, it
marks the clause boundary. A clausal determiner makes the clause more ‘definite’: it
becomes a ‘given’ in the discourse and draws attention to the clause. The clausal
determiner fo is glossed as ‘DET’.
The identification of a clausal determiner is somewhat problematic. Clausal determiners
occur strictly in clause-final position, and they are usually left untranslated. They can be
defined negatively: they are not attributive demonstratives, aspect adverbials or anaphoric
referents.
An example involving a clausal determiner appears in (200). This sentence, taken from
a narrative ‘sets the stage’ for the rest of the narrative. It is important that the listener picks
up the information in the clause, and it is therefore marked with fo.
(200)na pi
ait ø-tutu fò
/
then man 3M ø-chase DET
‘It is given that then the man chases.’The distinction between fo as a clausal determiner and fo as an aspect adverbial (see
§6.8.3) is fuzzy, as both occur in clause-final position. Theoretically, the two forms can cooccur, as indicated in example (201), but forms like these are unattested in natural speech.
The clausal determiner invariably occurs clause-finally.

So far, I have discussed demonstratives in several different functions, namely as
determiners in an NP (§5.1.6), as temporal adverbials (§6.8.1), as manner adverbials
(§6.8.2) and as location adverbials (§6.8.6). In this section I would like to illustrate the
function of demonstratives as anaphoric referents.
The demonstrative forms f-o and t-o can function anaphorically to refer to items in the
discourse that are already known. They are particular examples of what Himmelmann
refers to as ‘tracking use’ that is reference to entities that have already been introduced in
the discourse, and which help the listener to keep track of the story (Himmelmann
1996:240). The anaphoric use of deictic elements is common in Papuan languages,176Chapter 6although many of these languages seem to use the far deictic (which in Maybrat would be
-n- ‘far’) anaphorically (Reesink 1987:216).
The sentences in examples (204) and (205) are from a fairy tale. In (204) f-o,
underlined, functions anaphorically, referring back to ku m-ana eok re-f-o ‘these two
children’, which are introduced at the beginning of the example:
(204)ku m-ana

3U-head two very.near-U 3U-step {stone ø-sound}
‘These two children go wrong, and they emerge below at the “sounding stone”,
the land Mare. These two step on the “sounding stone”.’In example (205) ana f-o refers to the two women mentioned earlier in the example as
m-ana s-aux ‘the one’ and m-ana s-auy ‘the other’ (both enclosed in square brackets):

the speaker is expressed. Traditionally, a distinction is made between three basic types of
mood, namely interrogative, imperative and declarative. In the interrogative mood, the
speaker expresses a wish for information. In the imperative mood, the speaker expresses a
command or gives an instruction. The declarative mood can be defined negatively,
that is speech acts that are not interrogative or imperative are declarative (cf. Lyons
1968:307–308).
So far, the description of Maybrat has centred around simple declarative statements or,
in other words, statements in the indicative mood. In this short chapter, I will discuss two
moods that are grammatically marked, namely the interrogative mood and the imperative
mood. Interrogatives either contain an interrogative marker (polar questions and alternative
questions) or a question word (content questions). Imperatives are characterised by the
presence of an imperative marker re ‘please’ or by a distinct intonation pattern. The form
mai ‘PROHIB’ (prohibitive) marks the prohibitive. Syntactically, statements in the indicative
mood are unmarked.1
7.1 Interrogative
A distinction can be made between three types of question, namely polar questions,
alternative questions and content questions. Intonationally, all types of question behave in
the same way as other clauses, that is there is a fall in pitch towards the end of the clause.2
7.1.1 Polar questions
Polar questions, or Yes/No questions, are characterised by the presence of the interrogative
marker a in clause-final position. No variations in word order are required. Some examples
are given in (1)–(4). Examples (3)–(4) illustrate that the clausal periphery precedes the
interrogative marker. In each case the scope of the interrogator is the entire clause.
12Given that I assume that ‘mood’ is concerned with the attitude of the speaker, the category of ‘pseudoquotatives’, i.e. constructions which include the verb -awe ‘say’ and which express the thought content of
the speaker, could also be described here. However, pseudo-quotative constructions cannot be formally
distinguished from indirect speech forms, which also include -awe ‘say’. Because a formal distinction
cannot be made, pseudo-quotatives are described together with forms involving -awe in Chapter 8.
This is unusual, as according to the universalist view, questions are typically associated with a higher
pitch (see Ladd 1996:113–115).","[191, 192, 193, 194, 195]"
"168Chapter 6In principle, these sentences are open to a third interpretation, namely one where the
subject is negated. This interpretation is extremely marked: if it is intended, the subject is
emphasised, and there may be a small pause following the subject.
(163)Potafit / ait y-apo
fe
Potafit
3M 3M-eat.meat NEG
‘It’s Potafit (and not someone else) who does not eat.’In discourse, these potential ambiguities given above normally do not arise. The reason
for this is that the interpretation of negated sentences normally depends on the context in
which they are used (cf. Payne 1985:198). In other words, as long as the context is known,
the interpretation of the negated sentence (that is the scope of the negator in that particular
case) is usually self-evident. For example, in (164) fe negates the clause m-he (ait), where
ait is the object that has been omitted in the sentence because it is already known from the
previous sentence. It is clear that the interpretation of m-he fe should be ‘They don’t see
him’, (that is the scope of the negation is the object of the clause, since the previous
sentence indicates that a group of people is looking for ‘him’). This interpretation is
confirmed in the following sentence m-awe y-e y-amo.
(164)m-awe y-ama
ø-ste iso. M-he fe.
M-awe y-e
y-amo
3U-say 3M-come ø-wait road 3U-see NEG 3U-say 3M-return 3M-go
‘They think he has come and is waiting on the road. They do not see him.
They think he has gone back.’The negator fe can also be used to create a statement which is semantically strongly
positive. Phonologically, these instances are pronounced at a high pitch, and usually with a
loud voice. Semantically, (165), for example, negates the fact that there is a little, thus
emphasises that there is a lot.24 An example:
(165)sa m-siar
rere
fe
fish 3U-many scrupulously NEG
‘An awful lot of fish.’ (lit. ‘It’s not a “regular” amount of fish.’)6.9.2 Predicative use
The negator fe can also function as a verb, in which case it takes a third person
unmarked person prefix. This form, m-fe, can be adequately translated as ‘it is not’. Some
examples follow:
(166)24arko
m-fe,
y-o
ita m-ata25
firewood 3U-NEG 3M-take leaf leaf
‘There is no firewood, he takes leafs.’Semantically similar constructions also appear in other languages, such as Du. Niet te weinig, lit. ‘not too
sparingly’, but actually meaning ‘an awful lot’.
25
The term ita m-ata possibly refers to ‘foliage’.","[185, 186]"
"The clause171In examples (166)–(167) I illustrated that the predicative form m-fe can negate an NP.
When elicited, some informants made the following distinction between the forms ‘NP fe’
and ‘NP m-fe’:
(179) a.b.arko
fe
firewood NEG
‘not firewood’ (Ind. bukan kayu bakar)
arko
m-fe
firewood 3U-NEG
‘There is no firewood.’ (Ind. kayu bakar tidak ada)However, according to many informants, forms analogous to the pair in example (179)
are identical in meaning.
There are also a few instances of -he fe which are translated by informants as ‘see it
does not work’, instead of ‘don’t see’. That is, the meaning of -he fe is the same as that of
-he m-fe. For example, in (180) a translation of y-he fe as ‘he does not see’ is inappropriate
in the context of the sentence:
(180)y-itah
u
y-he
fe. Y-itah
u
rae
sasu
3M-force again 3M-see NEG 3M-force again person shore
jadi
m-haf
m-kek
become 3U-stomach 3U-red
‘He forced again and he saw that it didn’t work. He forced again
and the people of the shore became angry.’29Negation of clauses with m-fe is rare, but an example appears below:
(181)au ro m-aku
m-hu m-fe
3U rel 3U-small 3U-stay 3U-NEG
‘The small one didn’t stay.’In other words, the use of fe as a clausal negator and m-fe as its predicative counterpart
is not fully consistent. A tally of each of these forms in the texts30 showed that fe occurs
more frequently as a clausal negator than as a nominal negator. Conversely, m-fe more
commonly functions as a nominal negator than as a clausal negator. However, on the
whole, the number of attestations of fe vastly outnumbers that of m-fe. In addition, in
absolute terms fe is more common as a nominal negator than m-fe. Both the absolute
frequency of fe and the fact that it functions as a nominal negator in a considerable amount
of instances suggest that m-fe as a negator is a marginal form.
6.9.4 Negation involving other adverbials
Both fe and m-fe are attested in combination with other adverbials. In this section I will
illustrate differences in scope of the negator in clauses that are modified by an adverbial,
beginning with fe.
29
The expression -haf m-kek, lit. ‘red stomach’ is used to refer to anger.
30A tally of the occurrence of fe and m-fe in the texts yielded the following numbers:
Negates clause
Negates NP

14172Chapter 6In most cases where a clause is modified by an adverbial and negated, the adverbial
precedes the negator, like ati in example (182), fi-t-o in (183), and fawen in (183) and
(184). In all these examples, the negator is interpreted as saying something about the
adverbial, that is (182) implies ‘I am a man, but not a “real” (ati) man’. Likewise, (184)
implies ‘We do this thing, but not for a long time’.
(182)tuo rae
ati fe

‘I am not a real person.’(183)y-no

re-t-o
fawen
fe
woman 1P 1P-do thing location.SPEC-near-U long.time NEG
‘(We) women, we haven’t done these things (=traditional education)
for a long time.’The focus adverb iye ‘too’ can precede and follow the negator in a clause. Varying the
position of fe and iye results in a difference in scope of these adverbs. Consider, for
instance, the two forms in example (185) (both elicited forms). In (185a) the scope of the
negator is the clause y-amo Kumurkek, and the scope of the adverbial iye is the entire
(negative) clause Simon y-amo Kumurkek fe. Conversely, in (185b), the scope of the
negator is Kumurkek iye. The implication of (185b) is that ‘Simon’ goes to many places,
but not to Kumurkek, whereas in (185a) the implication is that in addition to others who do
not go to Kumurkek, Simon doesn’t go to Kumurkek either.

In word-final position any single consonantal phoneme can occur except for /p/, /y/ and

morpheme-initial position, and (2) in morpheme-medial position on the condition that the
first C in such a CC-cluster is a nasal. In (20) below I have indicated the morpheme-initial
CC-clusters that occur:24An attempt was made to oppose /VV/ and /VyV/ or /VwV/, but the answers given by informants were not

The quantifying verbs m-tut and prut both modify the RC (see §4.2.2.3 on quantifying verbs). It is
uncommon that two modifiers of the same word class modify an NP (see §5.1.2).
31
This is an instance of kayie functioning as a ‘semantic negative’ (see §4.7.5 and §6.9.5).
32
There are a number of occurrences of the temporal adverb orie with a subject prefix m- in the data. It is
unclear what the semantic difference is between this form and, for instance, orie re.
33
Here Waisafo is irritated that Henky interrupts him. This is marked in the utterance by a sharply rising and
falling pitch. Waisafo reacts by speaking very fast in the next sentence, thus preventing Henky from
interrupting again.
34
The meaning and function of mi are unclear here.
35
This form was pronounced by Waisafo Tenau as [s´n»diri], i.e. with a voiced stop [d]. Many older people
in Ayawasi cannot pronounce voiced stops, and would render this form as [sEn»tiri]. As mentioned above,
Waisafo Tenau’s speech was influenced by his mother’s, who used a southern dialect. In southern dialects
(Maymaru and Mayte, see §1.7), voiced stops are used.",[268]

and people. To begin with, I thank NWO: research for this dissertation was conducted
within the framework of the NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research)
priority programme ‘The Irian Jaya Studies: a programme for interdisciplinary research’
(ISIR), financed by WOTRO (Netherlands Organization for the Advancement of Tropical
Research). Secondly, I would like to thank Dr Hasan Alwi, head of the ‘Pusat Pembinaan
dan Pengembangan Bahasa’, for acting as my sponsor, enabling me to carry out fieldwork
in Indonesia, and the ‘Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia’ (LIPI), under whose auspices
the research was carried out. I am indebted to Han Schoorl for kindly giving me all the
language material that he collected while he was in Ayawasi in the early seventies for his
anthropological research, as well as background information about people in the village
before I went there. The Roman Catholic Missionaries in Sorong, particularly the
Augustinian Fathers P. Tuyp, T. Tromp and F. Jonkergouw, were always hospitable, and
helped to solve many logistic problems. Likewise, my thanks are due to Father B.
Ngamelubun and Father J. Fatem in Ayawasi, as well as to the Sisters of the ‘Ordo Sancto
Franciscus’ (OSF), who initially put me up in Ayawasi, and were always there when I
needed them.
I am greatly indebted to all the people in Ayawasi and other villages for helping me to
gather data. I would especially like to thank Didimus Bame and Yan Piter Tenau, who
assisted me with many transcriptions of the recorded material, and Petrus Turot, my main
informant, for his time, his understanding, his lucid explanations and, most of all, his
patience. I thank Elisabeth (Lys) Korain, Maria Fanataf, and Yuliana Yumte for their
friendship, and the latter especially for refusing to speak Indonesian to me. I hope that this
description will do some justice to the Maybrat language, and will reflect the enthusiasm
with which everyone in the village taught me. I am also grateful to Marcel Polak and his
family and to Colin Ridsdale for their collegiality and comraderie while we were doing
fieldwork. I am particularly grateful to Wanda Avé, the ethnobotanist, for all the work we
did, and still do, together and for her warm friendship.
An earlier version of this work was submitted as a doctoral dissertation at the University
of Leiden, and was defended on September 15, 1999. I am very grateful to my supervisor
Ger Reesink, who supported me throughout the various stages of this work. His critical and
detailed comments have been invaluable, and it was he who taught me how to approach
descriptive linguistics. My promoter, Wim Stokhof, continuously cheered me on and
provided many useful comments in the final stages of this research. I would like to express
especially warm thanks to Bert Voorhoeve, our ‘veteran’ Papuanist and descriptive
linguist, who always managed to come up with questions and details that no one else came
xxi
up with, and which eventually greatly improved this work. Cecilia Odé helped me with the
phonetic analysis of my data both in the field and in the Netherlands: I am grateful for that,
and for our friendship that resulted from travelling and working together. In the final stages
of this work Professor C.L. Ebeling provided many detailed comments which have saved
me from some considerable phonological and other linguistic blunders. I thank Lourens de
Vries for evaluating the entire manuscript and suggesting some improvements in the form
of an index and word-lists. Finally, I thank Professor T.C. Schadeberg, Colin Ewen, Gunter
Senft, Hein Steinhauer and Aone van Engelenhoven for reading the manuscript before I
defended it and providing another set of useful comments. Prior to publication of this
manuscript, an anonymous reviewer of Pacific Linguistics commented on the entire
version, which led to a number of notable improvements for which I am very grateful.
I would like to thank my colleagues at the Projects Division for their practical and moral
support throughout this project. Mary Bakker supported me with many logistic matters, not
only when I was in the field, but also at home in Leiden. I thank Raymond Menick for the
discussions we had in ‘The Lambada’ in Sorong, on linguistics in particular and The Bird’s
Head in general. Ron Habiboe made the maps, and gave many tips on how to tame the
computer. Miriam van Staden and Aglaia Cornelisse meticulously ploughed through the
manuscript, and provided me with helpful comments. Elja Dekker was always (and I mean
always) ready to answer stylistic questions, and confidently predicted the ultimate
completion of this project from the beginning onwards. I thank Ruurd for turning round the
Maybrat–English wordlist, and for being my wonderful partner and father to our daughters
Eline and Charlotte and to our son Adriaan. Last, but not least, I thank my parents, to
whom I have dedicated this work, for always letting me go my own way, while at the same
time always giving me their unconditional love and support.
Naturally, any mistakes that remain are my responsibility entirely.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

1P-stay dark bird 3U-come
‘We immediately enjoyed this,4 we always stayed and heard the aeroplane.
And then we became acquainted with the radio, formerly we just lived in
the dark.5 We lived in the dark and the aeroplane came.’
A second use of mati is to link an NP or an adverbial and a clause. In this position, the
NP or adverbial then functions as a verbless clause, that is it has the same intonational
characteristics as clauses that occur in this position. Consider, for instance, example (10),
where the NP ana m-ana tuf ‘the three of them’ functions as a verbless clause:
(10)ana m-ana
túf / mati
m-po
tapam tuoh
3P 3U-head three
and.then 3U-hold land place
we-f-ò
location.GEN-very.near-U
‘The three of them, they took (developed) the land in this place.’In this context, the function of mati is to emphasise the previous NP. For example, (11b)
is an informative statement. In contrast with (11b), (11a) was found in a context where
Wuon (the initiation of men) was compared to fnia m-kiar (the ‘education’ of women).6
The question was whether pofit (‘ginger’) played a role in fnia m-kiar. The answer was
negative, after which a comparison with Wuon was given in the form of (11a). The comma
in the translation is given to indicate the emphasis on the word Wuon (as opposed to fnia
m-kiar).

3U-enough PRESTT-near-U INT

the object of the clause. For instance, in (5) the question is about whether or not ‘they’ go
to Kumurkek, and not about whether or not people are ‘going’. To interrogate the ‘going’, a
construction like (1) is used. Likewise, in (7) the question is about whether the aeroplane
will descend on ‘this football-field’, and not about the ‘descent’ of the aeroplane.
(5)ana m-amo Kumurkek a

‘Does an aeroplane descend on this football-field?’In the following examples, the interrogatives include an aspect adverbial. The scope of

situation where people have first cut grass somewhere else.

‘Does the aeroplane just descend on the ground, here?’Polar questions can be answered affirmatively in two ways: by ae ‘yes’, uttered with a
rising pitch; or by a gestural answer whereby both eyebrows are raised. Polar questions can
be answered negatively by using the negator fe ‘NEG’, or the interjection ehe ‘no’.
Negative polar questions are formed by placing the interrogative in clause-final position
following the negated clause. An example follows:Mood
(10)179ait y-awe
n-fon kaket fe
a
3M 3M-say 2-tie well NEG INT
‘He says: “Didn’t you tie it well?”’The scope of polar questions over more complex constructions is discussed in
Chapter 8. In that chapter, the scope of the interrogator is used to test the constituency of
constructions that involve sequences of verbs.
7.1.2 Alternative questions
Alternative questions are characterised by the presence of an interrogative marker a
following the second conjunct in a complex construction in which two conjuncts are
connected by fe. The form fe here functions as a disjunctive coordinator, and is adequately
translated as ‘or’. In this type of construction, there is a pause directly following the first
clause, and the intonation rises, as indicated in example (11). For a more detailed
discussion of disjunctive coordination, see §9.1.3.

The function of content questions is to request specific information about something.
Content questions are formed with the question words discussed in §4.5. In the clause,
these question words replace the constituent about which information is requested.
Question words can replace a whole NP or a nominal constituent in the NP, or one of the
peripheral constituents like time adverbials, location adverbials and manner adverbials. In
this section I will discuss the syntactic behaviour of the different types of question words.","[195, 196, 197]"

sentence occur commonly in Maybrat, as they do indeed in many Papuan languages (see,
for instance Foley 1986:175–176). Superficially many of these sequences look alike. For
instance, morphologically (1) and (2) look similar because each verb carries a person
prefix. However, they are quite different in constituency. Example (1) represents a
coordinating construction, in which each verb constitutes a separate clause. This is
indicated in the translation. In order to coordinate clauses, an overt coordinator, like
English ‘and’ is not needed in Maybrat. Example (1) is formally similar to (2), so there is
nothing that prevents us from interpreting (2) as ‘He speaks and he stabs a cuscus.’
However, syntactically these constructions are quite different: in (2), y-ame kak ‘he kills a
cuscus’ is an object complement of y-awe. Likewise, by analogy to (1), (3) could be
translated as ‘He goes and he towards the sago tree’ although this translation sounds odd.
In (3), y-kit aof functions as the locative object of the verb y-amo.
(1)y-apo y-ata
3M-eat 3M-drink
‘He eats and he drinks.’(2)y-awe y-ame kak
3M-say 3M-stab cuscus
‘He wants to stab a cuscus.’(3)rae
y-amo y-kit
aof
person 3M-go 3M-towards sago.tree
‘The man goes towards the sago tree.’The question, of course, is in what ways one type of verb sequence differs from another,
and what criteria can be used to describe these distinctions. In the present chapter I will
illustrate how with a number of different criteria the syntactic differences between the
sequences like those in examples (1)–(3) can be described. The different types of verb
sequences that can be identified in Maybrat are listed below (including the section where
they are discussed):186Sequences of verbs

constructions involving an object complement, as in (2)

comitatives
a problematic categoryThe chapter is set up as follows: In §8.1, I will present a discussion of coordinating
sequences of verbs. They are characterised according to three different types of criteria,
namely intonational (§8.1.1); morphological (§8.1.2); and syntactic (§8.1.3). In the section
on syntax, I will perform three tests that bring out the constituency of these coordinating
verb sequences: insertion of an overt coordinator; examination of the scope of the
interrogative marker a; and relativisation on the object of a clause. Having established the
properties of coordinating sequences of verbs, I will contrast other types of juxtaposed
verbal forms with these coordinating sequences. In §8.2, I discuss what will be referred to
as adverbial verbs, that is sequences that include a verb which functions as a modifier to a
main verb. Section 8.3 concentrates on sequences in which the second verb (and its
arguments or modifiers) functions as an object complement of the first verb. In these
sequences, the first verb may be a perception verb; a mental activity verb; the causative
verb -no ‘do’; or the verb -awe ‘say’. Section 8.4 discusses prepositional verbs. I will show
that some prepositional verbs have more ‘verbal’ properties than others. The latter behave
more like prepositions. In §8.5, I will describe some syntactic properties of comitative
constructions.
Having used relativisation as a syntactic test for the constituency of sequences of verbs
in this chapter, in §8.6 I will summarise some properties of the relativisability of arguments
in different syntactic types of constructions. I will relate these facts to Keenan and
Comrie’s ‘Accessibility Hierarchy’. Finally, in §8.7, I will present some types of verb
sequences that share properties with both the coordinating constructions discussed in §8.1,
and the constructions involving an object complement. These constructions resemble
constructions that are labelled ‘serial verb constructions’ (SVCs) in the literature.
In the remainder of this chapter, if I refer to ‘verb’, it is implied that this includes a
verbal form plus its arguments, unless otherwise stated. I realise that strictly speaking,
‘verb’ refers to a morphological entity, whereas in this section the functional
characteristics, or the constituency of the verbal forms, are discussed. However, using the
term ‘clause’ for these entities is misleading, since it will appear that some verbal forms
are not clausal. Therefore, ‘verb’ is chosen as a neutral umbrella term.
8.1 Coordination
A coordinating construction can be defined as a construction involving a sequence of
syntactic units, all of the same syntactic category and rank (Zwicky 1990:4). The elements
in these sequences can be either juxtaposed or overtly coordinated (Dik 1997:196). The
problem in Maybrat, as illustrated in examples (1)–(3), is the absence of overt coordinators
in sequences which formally (that is categorially) contain verbs, but functionally (that is
with respect to syntactic rank) may or may not constitute clauses. The question thus is,
which criteria can be used to illustrate that each verb in a sequence syntactically functions
as a clause.","[202, 203, 204, 205]"

‘I deceive’In Maybrat, any form consisting of an overtly prefixed verb can function as a clause,
that is as a constituent consisting minimally of a predicate (the morphological verb) and its
arguments (its person prefix) (see Chapter 6, Introduction, and §6.2). Verbal forms with a
phonologically repressed person prefix can function as a clause just like forms with a
phonologically expressed person prefix. Any form without a phonologically expressed
person prefix can also function as a clause. For the sake of consistence, I assume that those
forms with and those without a phonologically expressed person prefix are structurally
similar. Therefore, I introduce a zero prefix ‘ø-’ to represent the phonologically repressed
person prefix in these forms.
I do realise that the introduction of a ‘zero-morpheme’ may seem redundant, since its
occurrence is restricted to two word classes, namely the class of verbs (§4.2) and the class
of inalienably possessed nouns (§4.3.1). Often, the word class that a form belongs to is
clear from its syntactic behaviour, and, given the morphophonological description here, the
absence of an overt person prefix on these forms can be predicted. However, I have chosen
to mark covert person prefixes throughout this work for two reasons: firstly, and crucially,
there are a number of forms where the presence versus the absence of a person prefix plays
a role: for example, number phrases are headed by a prefixless inalienably possessed
pronoun. Addition of a person prefix could render a different meaning (see §5.1.4). In
adverbial verbs the presence versus the absence of a person prefix is also crucial to the
meaning of an utterance (§8.2). The only way to adequately describe these forms is by
introducing a zero-morpheme, which can, just like overt morphemes, be omitted in the
description where this is required. Secondly, typologically, in many languages the
description of sequences of verbs (or serial verb constructions) hinges on the presence
versus the absence of inflection on the verbs. In my view, the description of sequences of
verbs in Maybrat (Chapter 8) is unambiguous by marking all the inflections, be they overt
or covert. This prevents misinterpretations about the syntactic behaviour of the verbs in
these sequences.
3.1.3 Some exceptions
So far, the analysis of the constraints on the phonological expression of person prefixes
in terms of the CV-syllable structure has been straightforward: forms with monosyllabic
stems, and forms with V-initial stems take overt person prefixes. C-initial forms with
bisyllabic stems take covert person prefixes, unless the second syllable in the stem is Vinitial, or the stem contains a VV-sequence where one V is a (reducible) /i/ or /u/ (see also
§2.6). C-initial stems with two or more syllables take covert person prefixes. There are two
categories of forms, however, that do not seem open to such a straightforward solution. To54Chapter 3begin with, the forms in (14) are bisyllabic, and the second syllable of the stem is V-initial.
By analogy to those forms in (7) and (9) which have /i/ or /u/ in their first syllable, the
forms in (14) would be expected to receive an overt person prefix. However, prefixed
forms are rejected, as indicated in the last column in the examples below:
(14)/kiam/
/fia/
/yuo/[»kijAm]
[»fija]
[»juwo]CV|VC
CV|V
CV|V‘I am ill’
‘I swallow’
‘I flee’*[m-»kijAm]
*[m-»fija]
*[m-»juwo]It seems to be the case that CV-structure alone cannot account for all the forms, and that
in some cases stress also plays a role. Recall, that in Maybrat, stress is lightly phonemic. In
many cases it can be predicted, but in the forms in (14), stress falls on the first syllable, and
/i/ or /u/ in this syllable cannot be reduced. The resulting verb has two syllables, and will
not allow a person prefix because this would add an extra syllable to the form, resulting in
an illicit tri-syllabic form.2
A second group of forms that do not tally with the observation that monosyllabic stems
can take an overt person prefix is given in (15). These forms, despite the fact that they
constitute monosyllabic stems, never take overt person prefixes. I propose that these forms
are marked lexically as exceptions to the rule of person prefixing.3
23An alternative solution is as follows: if on a morphophonological level it is assumed that the glides [y]
and [w] between the vowels in (14) are not epenthetic, but phonologically present, i.e. /y/ and /w/, then
the stems of the forms in (14) can be represented as in (a) below. This yields forms in which the second
syllable of the stem is C-initial, i.e. forms that are analogous to those in (10), (11) and (12):
(a) /kiyam/
[»kijAm]
CV|CVC
‘I am ill’
/fiya/
[»fija]
CV|CV
‘I swallow’
/yuwo/
[»juwo]
CV|CV
‘I flee’
The difference in morphological behaviour between all these forms could then be explained in terms
of CV-structure, just like the other forms. However, there are no minimal pairs to warrant a distinction
between the presence versus the absence of the glides /y/ and /w/ in this position. As such, the distinction
would have to be described on a morphophonological level.
Obviously this morphophonological criterion does not work for forms that never take a person
prefix. For example, nouns that have a /VyV/ sequence or a /VwV/ sequences may be transcribed
morphophonologically as either :VyV: / :VwV: or as :VV:, as illustrated in (b):

There is one way to explain the odd behaviour of the forms in (15), namely that they are a relic of what
was once a distinction in length. Throughout the collection of data, informants kept insisting on audible
differences between certain homophones, for instance between the forms given in Chapter 2, footnote 20
([»nasçm] ‘You carry, your name is’; [»maru] ‘She cuts, lake’; [»ana] ‘they, fence’ and [»moo] ‘She takes,
She itches’; and [m´»tAx] ‘dog, It is bitter’ etc.). The strategies to find this difference were as follows: (1)
Recordings were made of the words both in isolation and in context. In these recordings no differences
were found after thorough analysis with the speech program GIPOS (Graphical Interactive Processing of
Speech, see also Chapter 2, footnote 34); (2) The recordings mentioned in (1) were manipulated,
whereby: (a) the vowels in the forms were lengthened/shortened, and the pitch at which they were uttered
was changed; and (b) putative minimal forms uttered in a context were interchanged. The results of these
manipulations were offered to informants, but no clear indications for the existence for minimal pairs wasMorphophonology

The formation of question words suggests the presence of a morphophonological glide
between two vowels. Question words are formed by adding an interrogative particle -yo or
-ye to a demonstrative base.4 Some examples (forms between ‘: :’ are morphophonological
representations):
(16)/to-yo/
/wo-yo/:to-yo:
:wo-yo:‘where’ (SPEC)
‘where’ (GEN)Two other forms, including the morphophonological representations, appear below:
(17)/fi-ye/
/mi-yo/:fi-ye:
:mi-yo:‘how’
‘where’ (ADV)Theoretically, the morphophonological forms in (17) could be *:fie: and *:mio:, as these
could underlie the same phonetic forms as those given above, that is [»fije] and [»mijo]
respectively. However, it is clear from the forms in (16) that the interrogative suffix is
:y:-initial. By analogy, I conclude that the suffixes in the forms in (17) are also :y:-initial,
in other words, that the glide in these forms is morphophonologically present.
3.3 /a/-initial stems
Maybrat verbs and inalienably possessed nouns (including kinship terms) of which the
stem begins with /a/, lack this /a/ in the first and second person plural forms (but not in the
third person unmarked). In other words, there is an alternation between first and second
person plural stems and the rest. If the first and second person plural stems are
C-initial, the CC-sequence resulting after prefixation with a phonologically expressed
person prefix is broken up by an epenthetic schwa.","[70, 71, 72, 73]"
"6Chapter 1includes a short word list. Elmberg’s PhD dissertation, ‘Balance and circulation: aspects of
tradition and change among the Mejprat of Irian Barat’ (1968), includes a transcription of a
myth in Maybrat. There is an extensive Maybrat-English word list which includes over
1500 lexical items. Again, no morphological information is given, but a short introduction
to the orthography gives an idea about how the language is pronounced.
The first published information about the people in Ayawasi appears in an ethnography
by H. Schoorl, ‘Mensen van de Ayfat: Ceremoniële ruil en sociale orde in Irian JayaIndonesia’ (1979).14 In the description, many Maybrat terms are included. These terms
only represent a small part of the language material Schoorl collected in Ayawasi:
extensive word lists and recordings of myths, some of which had been transcribed, were
kindly given to me when I started working on the Maybrat language.
More recently, two linguistic articles based on fieldwork in Ayamaru were published by
W.U. Brown, namely ‘Mai Brat nominal phrases’ (1990) and ‘A quantitative phonology of
Mai Brat’ (1991).
A word list including approximately 2500 lexical items in Maybrat/Indonesian/English
was published by UNCEN-SIL.15 These words are arranged according to semantic
category, and in alphabetical order. Some other works have also been published by
UNCEN-SIL: one of these is a book which includes five stories about the origins of rivers
and lakes.16 These works are also based on the Ayamaru dialect.
Recently, research has been conducted in the Bird’s Head within the framework of the
programme ‘Irian Jaya Studies: a programme for interdisciplinary research’ (ISIR).17
1.6 The language
The name Maybrat (see next paragraph for this orthography)18 is morphologically a
compound noun (for an analysis of compound nouns, see §4.3.5), consisting of two
members. The first is mai, a noun meaning ‘sound’. This form can also function as a verb
stem, as in, for instance n-mai ‘You make a sound’; p-mai ‘We make a sound’. The second
part, brat, seems to refer to the type of sound, in other words, the particular language
variety. However, the isolated form brat is unattested. The people who speak Maybrat refer
to themselves as rae ro Maybrat <man REL {sound brat}> ‘the people who speak
Maybrat’. These people are subdivided into groups according to the area where they

Research by the present author has resulted in a number of publications on the Maybrat language, namely
Dol (1995; 1996; 1998; 2000). Other collections of work on the Bird’s Head include Bartstra, ed. (1998)
on geology, Miedema et. al. (1998) reporting on the results of an interdisciplinary conference on the
Bird’s Head, and Reesink (forthcoming) on languages of eastern Bird’s Head.

In §2.1.2 I point out that if [j] and [w] occur phonetically in this position, they are allophones of /i/ and /u/
respectively, and not of /y/ and /w/. Since the orthography I use is based on the phonemic structure of a
form (see §3.6), one would expect the form Maibrat. However, in spelling the name of this language as
Maybrat, I follow the orthography that the Maybrat themselves use. The forms [maj0brYt] and [maj0prYt]
vary freely, although the former is more common, hence the orthography.
15Introduction7originate, for instance, the people in Ayawasi are referred to as rae Hapeh, those of the
East Ayfat as rae Asmaun, those of Fef as rae Karon, those of Suswa as rae Mare.19 In
Ayawasi it was agreed that these people all qualified as rae ro Maybrat, since everyone
spoke the same language, although the dialects differed.
Maybrat is spoken in the kecamatans Ayfat, Ayamaru, Aytinyo, Kebar and Sausapor, of
which kecamatan Ayfat is most centrally located. The area where Maybrat is spoken
covers approximately 2570 km2 (Schoorl 1979:11).
With the establishment of schools in the area, the Indonesian language has also become
widely used. In Ayawasi, where a primary school was established in the early 1950s, many
people under 50 years of age, as well as all younger people, are bilingual in Maybrat and
Indonesian. Older people often speak Indonesian20 to some extent, but prefer to speak
Maybrat. Some older people speak no Indonesian at all. Indonesian is the standard
language in the schools, in contacts with the mission and in the Church.21 At the hospital,
Maybrat is often used by the local nurses when dealing with the elderly. In daily life, both
Maybrat and Indonesian are used, although I noted a preference for Maybrat. Children
learn the two languages simultaneously. Maybrat speakers often pepper their Maybrat with
Indonesian words (but rarely the other way around), or they switch back and forth between
Maybrat and Indonesian.22 Older members of Maybrat families who live in the cities,
usually people who grew up in a village in the interior, may use Maybrat. Their children,
however, only have a limited passive knowledge of the language.
Maybrat has a number of linguistically interesting characteristics. Morphologically,
there are two classes of nouns: those that are obligatorily prefixed for possession, namely
kinship terms and terms for body parts, and those that are not prefixed. The nouns that are
obligatorily prefixed receive person prefixes in exactly the same way as verbs.
Maybrat has an elaborate system of complex demonstratives comprising three bases
which express distance from the point of view of the speaker. Suffixes are taken according
to gender, and the choice of prefix depends on the syntactic function, its meaning, and
specificity. For instance, there are distinct prefixes to refer to specific areas as opposed to
large areas. A number of demonstratives also have derived functions, such as temporal
adverbials and anaphoric referents, while others can function as markers for locative and
temporal adverbial clauses. In the formation of interrogative forms, some of the
demonstrative prefixes are used.
The number system is based on body parts: the numbers from ‘one’ to ‘four’ are unique
terms, and these are combined with terms for hand/finger and foot/toe to form the numbers
up to ‘nineteen’.","[23, 24, 25]"
"116Chapter 4When -fe is used predicatively, there is no agreement between the person prefix on -fe
and the subject of the clause. Hence, example (301a) is unacceptable. Instead, (301b) must
be used:
(301) a.*rae ro sme y-fe
man REL male 3M-NEGb.rae ro sme m-fe
man REL male 3U-NEG
‘He is not a male.’The scope of the negator fe in clauses is discussed in §6.9.1–6.9.2. In §6.9.3 some
problems with the distinction between fe and m-fe are discussed.
The adverb mai ‘PROHIB’ marks the ‘prohibitive’. The adverb mai can be adequately
translated as ‘don’t’. It invariably occurs in clause-final position. The following is an
example:
(302)n-ata aya
re-t-o
mai
2-drink water location.SPEC-near-U PROHIB
‘Don’t drink that water!’Some more examples of the prohibitive are given in §7.2.
There are other negators, that is forms that correct the previous assertion, namely kayie
‘not’ and peroh ‘wrong’. These adverbs are always followed by a correction of the
previous statement. Kayie can only deny nominal constituents. The negator peroh can deny
both NPs and clauses. Some examples follow:
(303)Koru kayie m-tut m-ama m-hu fte Tuoh Pamai
Koru not
3U-all 3U-come 3U-stay area Tuoh Pamai
‘Not at Koru, they all come and lived in the area Tuoh Pamai.’(304)Fanataf 62 ta 63 / peroh ait ø-kpat Kocu Ata
Fanataf
LOC
wrong 3M ø-leave Kocu Ata
‘(He leaves) Fanataf there. No, he leaves Kocu Ata.’These negators are further discussed in §6.9.4, under the heading ‘negation involving
other adverbials’.
4.7.6 Focus adverbs
The focus adverbs listed in example (305) are used to draw attention to the event
expressed in the clause. They usually occur in clause-final position, but may also precede
the object in a clause. The marker re may be related to the manner adverb rere ‘carefully’.
The marker re is adequately translated as ‘please’.","[133, 134]"
"6The clauseA clause is a unit consisting minimally of a predicate and its arguments. Its function is
to introduce new propositions in the discourse (Givón:1984:85). The description of the
clause in Maybrat must be centred around two criteria, namely syntactic and intonational:
syntactically, the simplest type of clause consists of a verb and its arguments and,
optionally, its (adverbial) modifiers. Given that the person prefix on a verb expresses its
subject when the verb functions as a clause, it can be assumed that a person prefix
functions as a subject argument in a clause. With the exception of the obligatory person
prefix, the arguments of a verb need not be expressed as NPs, leaving a clause which
formally consists of a single verb. This type of clause has a unique intonation pattern. This
intonation pattern is needed to distinguish between the two forms below: formally both
constitute a sequence of verbs, and could theoretically constitute a sequence of clauses.
However, they are intonationally different, which indicates that example (1a) syntactically
consists of two clauses, while (1b) consists of one clause, in which t-aut ara functions as
an object complement:
(1) a.b.t-sam
/ t-aut
ara
1s-scared
1s-climb tree
‘I’m scared, and I climb into the tree.’
t-sam
t-aut
ara
1s-scared 1s-climb tree
‘I’m scared to climb into the tree.’Examples of this type are discussed in the chapter on sequences of verbs.
In this chapter I will restrict myself to a description of ‘simple’ clauses, that is those
consisting of a single verb as predicate. The description of sequences of clauses is deferred
until Chapter 8. The present chapter is set up as follows: in §6.1, I will give the basic
syntactic structure of the clause, and its intonational characteristics. Section 6.2 discusses
the head of the clause, §6.3 the subject and §6.4 the object. Subsequently, in §6.5, nominal
clauses are presented. Topicalisation is described in §6.6. In §6.7, I will discuss
relativisation, that is the extraction of subject and object arguments from single-verb
clauses. In §6.8, the various types of adverbials that add extra information to a clause are
treated. These adverbials are collectively referred to as the ‘periphery’ of the clause. The
different types of periphery that can be distinguished are the time periphery; the manner
periphery; the aspect periphery; and the focus periphery. In §6.8.5 I will show that these
142The clause143peripheries can be combined. In the following section the location periphery is treated. In
§6.9 negation, formed with the adverb fe, is discussed. In §6.10, the clausal determiner is
described. In §6.11, I will give some examples of anaphoric reference, although this is,
strictly speaking, a discourse phenomenon, and not a clausal phenomenon.
6.1 Basic structure of the clause
The basic structure of the clause in Maybrat is given in example (2). The order of
constituents, SVO, is rigid.
(2){Time} + (Subject) s-V (+Object) + {Location/Manner/Aspect + Det}A clause always consists of a head, the verb (V) taking an overt or covert person prefix.
Subjects and objects may be expressed as full NPs, but may also be omitted if they have
been mentioned earlier in the discourse. The omission of a subject or object does not
violate the acceptability of a clause. An object normally follows the verb, but it may also
be ‘topicalised’, that is fronted, to attract the attention of the listener. Temporal adverbials
precede the verb, and may precede the subject NP, in a clause, while location/manner/
aspect adverbials normally follow the verb and, if present, the object.
A salient characteristic of clauses is their intonation pattern: on the last word of the
clause the pitch rises slightly, followed by a sharp drop. Following this sharp drop, there is
a pause.1
(3)ait y-amo Kumurkek òh
/ men
y-e
ù
/
3M 3M-go Kumurkek already tomorrow 3M-return again
‘He’s already gone to Kumurkek, tomorrow he will return again.’If another sentence follows, there may also be a rise in pitch, as illustrated below. The
same example illustrates that a fall in pitch at the end of a clause is not obligatory:
(4)y-pat
Tenau Kosetiáh / y-ama
y-hu / Tenau Kohmaró
3M-from Tenau Kosetiah
3M-come 3M-stay Tenau Kohmaro
‘He was from Tenau Kosetiah, he came to live at Tenau Kohmaro ...’/Intonation may be indicative of a differing constituent structure, as indicated in example
(5). Example (5a) contains two clauses, because there is a fall in pitch on the last syllable
of m-anes, followed by a pause. In this example, ku m-anes functions as a clause.
Conversely, (5b) contains just one clause: the only intonation break and sharp drop in pitch
are found utterance- (=clause) finally. Here, ku m-anes functions as a subject.
(5) a.b.","[159, 160, 161]"

ayu sia snie ø-frok
sun with moon ø-emerge
‘The sun and the moon emerge.’The omission of a subject-prefix results in a ‘decategorialised’ form, that is a form in
which aspects typical of that category, such as the presence of a person prefix for verbs, are
absent (cf. Hopper 1991:22). This feature, or rather the lack of this feature, may be
indicative of a grammaticalisation process in which the comitative verb is changing into a
preposition. Other motivations for a change in categorial status are the differing syntactic
properties of -sia compared to those of ‘true’ verbs. Shifts in the grammatical status of a
lexical item to assume a more grammatical function (here that of a coordinator) are often
accompanied by restricted morphological and syntactic properties (Heine et al. 1991:2,
they refer to Hopper and Thompson 1984).
The verb -sia also occurs in clause-final position. Its meaning here is not fully
understood. In examples (114) and (115) below, the verb -sia refers to the fact that a dog
accompanies the subject. Syntactically, the objects of the verbs, that is mtah sumaya r-ana
s-au in (114) and mtah in (115) are topicalised (see §6.6 on topicalisation). In these
examples, -sia semantically implies ‘be accompanied for hunting’. In (115b) mtah occurs
in clause-final position, but here the meaning of ‘accompany for hunting’ is absent.

always expressed, albeit as a topicalised form. The example in (116) is taken from a text
recorded 25 years ago.16 Possibly the verb -sia had more verbal properties then than it has
now, which would account for its ‘verbal’ behaviour in (116).

"8Chapter 1Many notions which in, for instance, English and Dutch are expressed by prepositions
are expressed by verbs in Maybrat, although it is obvious from the morphological and
syntactic behaviour of these Maybrat forms that they are less ‘verby’ than their true verbal
counterparts.
Syntactically, the most striking feature of Maybrat is the occurrence of verb sequences.
Despite their formal similarity, a distinction between several different types of sequence
can be made.
The present description is based on the language as it is spoken in Ayawasi. However,
as I mentioned earlier, Ayawasi is a relatively new village. Until it was formed, the people
used to live in small groups on their ancestral grounds. The language they spoke was the
same, but small (mainly lexical) differences occurred from one family to another.23 When
these families moved to Ayawasi, they each brought their own ‘family dialect’ with them.
The people who originally lived in the area where Ayawasi is now built have the following
family names: Tenau, Yumte, Kosho. Older people, especially, who are originally from
areas further away from Ayawasi can often be identified as such on the basis of their
speech. This is illustrated in a lot of the recorded tales: for example, four terms were found
in Ayawasi to denote one and the same animal, ‘cassowary’, but all originate from a
different area, namely posakof (originally from Mosun), kakru (originally from Pori,
formerly at one hour walking distance from Ayawasi, but now attached to Ayawasi),
ru kair (Ayawasi), and pohoho (unclear origin). In the younger generation, raised in
Ayawasi, lexical differences were not as pronounced as in the older generations. In other
words, Ayawasi is a melting pot of a number of different, but very closely related, ‘family
dialects’, which over 30 years have become more alike. In the description, I have indicated
the forms which are clearly ‘family dialectal’.
1.7 Dialects
According to the local population, Maybrat is spoken in six dialects, which they define
according to the area where each dialect is spoken. The criterion for the population is
mutual intelligibility: people referred to a dialect as Bahasanya sama, tetapi logatnya lain
‘The language is the same, but the way of speaking/the dialect is different’. The fact that,
for instance, the dialects Mayasmaun and Mayhapeh are highly similar is supported by the
fact that my main informant in Ayawasi had no problem in translating a Mayasmaun text
recorded in Aisa into Mayhapeh.24 The Maybrat themselves could always establish the
origin of a speaker by his accent. In the description of the dialects, I have maintained the
division made by the local population.
The six dialects are listed below, followed by some of the villages where the dialect is
spoken (see also Map 3). With the exception of Karon, in all dialect names the word mai
‘sound’ is present.","[25, 26]"

"5Noun phrasesIn this chapter I will discuss noun phrases (NP), that is structures that are headed by a
noun (or a pronoun) and that may have one or more dependents (Matthews 1981:161–162).
NPs typically function as arguments in a clause.
The basic structure of possible NPs in Maybrat is given in example (1). The portions
between braces can be subsumed under the heading ‘modifier’. The order of constituents in
the NP is rigid.
(1)Types of noun phrase:
a. ‘Regular’ noun phrase (NP):
N + (Verbal Modifier + [(Classifier) + Numeral]/[Quantifying verb]
+ Determiner)
b. Possessive NP:
N + (Ninalienable + [(Classifier) + Numeral] + Determiner) /
Nalienable + (ro + N + [(Classifier) + Numeral] + Determiner)
c. Relative clause (RC):
N + (ro + Clausal Modifier + Determiner)Thus, Maybrat is a ‘postmodifying’ language, since the modifiers follow the head noun.
This postnominal modifying order is in accordance with one of Greenberg’s universals,
namely that languages which have VO word order (Maybrat word order is SVO, see
Chapter 6) usually have noun-modifier order in NPs (Givón 1984:189, 199, 220, refers to
Greenberg 1966). The order of modifiers themselves in the NP conforms to another
universal, namely that if a language is post-modifying, the order of the modifiers is as
follows: descriptive adjective — numeral — demonstrative (Croft 1990:119, refers to
Greenberg 1966:87).
Below, §5.1 concentrates on the structure of the NP as given in example (1a). As was
pointed out in §4.3.1–§4.3.2, two types of possessive construction can be identified, given
in (1b). Possessive NPs are discussed in §5.2. In §5.3, I will describe the form and function
of relative clause constructions (RCs), where a head noun is modified by an RC. The basic
structure of RCs is given in (1c). As is apparent from (1b) and (1c) above, there are two
types of nominal construction which have the element ro in common (also pointed out in
§4.10.1). I will focus on the similarities between possessive constructions and RCs in §5.4.
127128Chapter 5In §5.5 I will illustrate how adverbials can modify a phrase. Finally, in §5.6, I will
discuss combinations of NPs.
5.1 The regular noun phrase
5.1.1 Head
The head in an NP is obligatory. It can be a noun, a pronoun, a quantifying verb (see
§5.1.5) or an attributive demonstrative (see §5.1.6). If the head is a pronoun, then there are
restrictions on the modifiers. Some examples of NPs headed by a noun are:
(2)ru m-api wo-n-o
bird 3U-big location.GEN-far-U
‘the big bird approximately there’(3)tfo
m-kek m-aku
s-au
machete 3U-red 3U-small one-3U
‘one small red machete’(4)ora
ø-pria t-o
garden ø-all
near-U
‘the entire garden’In examples (5)–(6) the head of the NP is semantically a proper noun. NPs which are
headed by a proper noun followed by an adjectival verb are typically nicknames.
(5)Simon y-apuf
re-t-ait
Simon 3M-short location.SPEC-near-3M
‘that Short Simon’(6)Maria m-anes re-au
Maria 3U-old location.SPEC-DIST.U
‘that Old Maria’
Examples of NPs headed by a free pronoun appear below:(7)ait y-api re-t-ait
3M 3M-big location.SPEC-near-3M
‘that big one (man)’(8)ana eok ro-n-o
3P two location.SPEC-far-U
‘the two of them there’ (lit. ‘they two there’)(9)ana ø-prut
3P ø-all
‘all of them’5.1.2 Verbal modifiers
In §4.2.2.2 a class of adjectival verbs was presented including some illustrative
examples of NPs where they function attributively. I stipulated that in an NP, adjectivalNoun phrases129verbs take a person prefix which is coreferent with the head of the NP. Some more
examples follow:
(10)rae
y-anes re-t-ait
person 3M-old location.SPEC-near-M
‘this old man’(11)fnia
m-anes re-t-o
woman 3U-old location.SPEC-near-U
‘this old woman’Noun phrases rarely occur with more than one verbal modifier. In examples (12) and
(13) there are two modifiers. The maximum number of verbal modifiers attested in the data
is two. In (13) the head noun is a compound noun. If more verbal modifiers are desired in
an NP, RC constructions are used, as in (14) (see §5.3):
(12)ku
ø-kiniah m-of
t-o
child ø-small 3U-nice near-U
‘these nice small children’(13)ara aut
m-api ø-kapes s-au
{Albizzia sp.} 3U-big ø-huge one-3U
‘one very big “Albizzia sp. tree”’1(14)ku
ø-kiniah m-of
ro ø-hifuoh
child ø-small 3U-good REL ø-diligent
‘the good small children that are diligent’If there are two modifiers, there is a preferred order: the information that is more
prominent or that expresses a more inherent property of the noun is found closer to the
noun (see Givón 1990:470). Thus, in example (15) (both of which are elicited utterances),
the implication in (15a) is that the tree is yellow of itself (that is ‘yellow’ pertains to a
salient characteristic of tree) and that an added property of the tree is that it is big. This is
precisely the other way around for (15b), where ‘big’ refers to an intrinsic property of the
tree, and an additional feature is that the tree is yellow.2
(15) a.ara ø-fiyaf
m-api t-o
tree ø-yellow 3U-big near-U
‘the big yellow tree’b.ara m-api ø-fiyaf
t-o
tree 3U-big ø-yellow near-U
‘the yellow big tree’5.1.3 Classifier
Classifiers may precede a numeral in an NP. Classifiers are used to emphasise the
number of items expressed by the noun head of the NP. Both forms below are acceptable,
and I have not been able to establish a semantic difference between the two:
1
2The grated bark of ara aut is heated in fire, and applied to boils to improve healing (Avé 1998:2).
Ara fiyaf can syntactically also be a compound noun (see §4.3.5). Ara fiyaf is claoxyloa sp. or Melicope
xanthoxyloides (Avé 1998:B8).","[144, 145, 146, 147]"
"208Chapter 8Semantically, the two differ slightly: in example (102a) the verb -ae is adequately
translated as ‘to be at’, as indicated in the English translation. In (102b) m-ae has little
semantic content: its function is that of a pointer which marks the following NP as a
location. The difference between these two kinds of -ae has consequences for its
intonational and syntactic behaviour: a sequence of a verb followed by m-ae cannot be
dominated by two intonation contours without rendering the utterance ungrammatical,13 as
illustrated in (103). The same applies to insertion of the overt coordinator mati, as in (104).

3U-at hanger(104)*ait y-amo
3M 3M-goø-frok

examples (105b) and (106b).14

‘They live in Ayawasi.’
*Ayawasi ro ana
Ayawasi REL 3Pm-hu m-ae Ø
3U-stay 3U-atm-of
3U-goodIt is clear from the above that -ae has two distinct syntactic functions. Whereas the
‘declining’ forms are similar to coordinating constructions, the defective paradigm
instances are different. I will return to the notion that a lexical item, like this defectiveparadigm verb -ae, is formally like a verb, but is functionally more like a preposition in the
following section.
8.4.1 Another note on ‘prepositions’
In §4.2.3.5 I showed that with the exception of -ae, the prepositional verbs cannot
function as main verbs in a clause although two of them, -kit and -pat, do take person
prefixes like regular verbs. In §8.4 I illustrated that, when placed in a sequence with other
verbs, the resulting sequences behave differently from coordinating sequences of verbs.
13Unless there is a rise in pitch on the first verb followed by a pause, in which case m-ae hanggar would be
emphasised, see (87)–(90).
14
It may seem odd that the b-form below is acceptable, as opposed to (105b) and (106b) which are not. A
possible explanation is that in the example below m-ae Ayawasi is interpreted as a separate clause, where
m-ae functions as a main verb:
a. ana m-amo m-ae Ayawasi
b. [[Ayawasi ro
m-amo Ø]] m-ae kait Ayata
3P 3U-go 3U-at Ayawasi
Ayawasi REL 3U-go
3U-at near Ayata
‘They go to Ayawasi.’
‘Ayawasi, that they go to, is near Ayata.’Sequences of verbs209Prepositional verbs seem to be less ‘verby’ than other verbs, with m-kah as the most
remarkable form, since its verbal character is debatable to begin with (see §4.2.3.5 for the
arguments to classify it as a verb).
Prepositional notions that are expressed by forms which are verbal in character to a
greater or lesser extent are found in many (serialising) languages. Lord (1973) finds that in
a number of Kwa languages, spoken in West Africa, some prepositions evolved from
locative verbs in a serial construction. Hamel (1993), in her description of Loniu, an
Oceanic language, finds that oblique roles such as locatives, causatives and instrument/
manner constructions are expressed by prepositions that are derived from verbs, but have
lost some of their verbal properties. Schachter (1974:265) states that verbs that occur in
serial verb constructions often lose their verbal characteristics resulting in a
‘reinterpretation as prepositions’. Disregarding for the moment the question of whether the
verb sequences described in the present section qualify as ‘serial verb constructions’ (I will
return to this in §8.7 and §8.8), the behaviour of Maybrat prepositional verbs is, from a
typological point of view, not unusual.
The question is whether these verbs should be analysed as prepositions or as verbs. Lord
(1993) gives a number of criteria that have to be met for a verbal form to qualify as a
preposition (Lord 1993:14). These criteria refer to the extent to which such verbal forms
are verbal in behaviour. In Maybrat, -ae can function as a main verb, whereas -kit, -pat and
-kah cannot. However, Lord states that objects of verbs can be extracted, whereas those of
prepositions cannot. According to this criterion then, -kit and -pat are more ‘verbal’ than
-ae and -kah, as the former two verbs allow relativisation of their objects more easily than
the latter two verbs. Likewise, -kit and -pat are more verbal than -ae and -kah because of
their ability to select nouns as subjects: as was illustrated above, -ae is sometimes, and
-kah is always a ‘defective paradigm’ verb. The ability to select a noun as a subject, which
with the exception of -kah all verbs clearly can do, is another property associated with
verbs, according to Lord.
It is clear that the ‘prepositional’ verbs in Maybrat are not exclusively prepositions, but
at the same time, they are not exclusively verbs, as they do not fully exhibit some of the
properties that are so typical of ‘real’ Maybrat verbs, such as the ability to function as a
main verb and the ability to take person prefixes.
8.5 Comitatives
The comitative verb -sia was introduced in §4.2.3.6. There, I stated that -sia takes both
a subject and an object, and that it cannot function as a main verb. In this section, I will
discuss the syntactic behaviour of comitative constructions.
Formally, -sia is a verb which takes two arguments. The person prefix of -sia must be
coreferent with the subject of the verb. The forms below are NPs: they cannot function as
predicates.
(107)tuo t-sia
fnia
1S 1S-with woman
‘I with the woman’(108)ait y-sia
y-ano
3M 3M-with 3M-sibling.OS
‘he with his sister’210Chapter 8In example (109a) tuo t-sia ait functions as the subject of a clause. The main verb -amo
‘go’ takes a first person singular person prefix t-. Conversely, in (109b), the main verb
takes a plural person prefix p- whilst in (110), there is also subject agreement. In this
example, the comitative is considered part of the subject, hence the plural case marking.
This type of comitative is more common in Papuan languages (see Reesink 1987:85).
(109) a.b.","[225, 226, 227, 228]"
"4Word classesIn the present chapter, Maybrat words are assigned to different word classes. I will
define word classes on the basis of two grammatical criteria, namely morphological and
syntactic (cf. Schachter 1985:3).
A word is the smallest unit of a sentence which has positional mobility (Cruse 1986:35)
and which cannot be interrupted by a pause (Lyons 1968:202). According to these criteria,
amah ‘house’ and fane ‘pig’ are words: they have positional mobility in the sentence and
they cannot be interrupted by a pause. By the same criteria, t-kias ‘I tell’ and re-f-o ‘this
very.near’ are words, albeit morphologically complex ones: they each consist of more than
one morpheme.
In Maybrat, the following thirteen word classes can be defined:
pronouns (person deixis)
verbs
nouns
demonstratives
question words
numerals
adverbs
location markers
directionals
coordinators
subordinate clause markers
enumerators
interjections
Person deixis is the first item to be discussed (§4.1). The reason for this early
presentation is that it can then be referred to in the subsequent discussion of the largest
(open) classes, that is those of verbs (§4.2) and nouns (§4.3). In the presentation of verbs,
the morphological properties are discussed in §4.2, and from §4.2.1 onwards the different
classes of verbs are discussed. At the end of §4.2, I will describe derivation. Section 4.3, on
nouns, begins with a discussion of inalienably possessed nouns which include kinship
terms, terms for body parts and spatial nouns, and alienably possessed nouns.
Subsequently, lexical nominalisation and compound nouns are treated. The class of
demonstratives is described in §4.4, followed by a discussion on question words in §4.5.
6162Chapter 4Following this, in §4.6, the number system, which is based on terms for body parts, is
presented. The six subclasses of adverbs, namely temporal adverbs, manner adverbs,
aspect adverbs, locative adverbs, negators and focus adverbs are discussed in §4.7. Section
4.8 covers locational forms including location markers and directionals. Finally, the
remaining word classes are presented, namely coordinators (§4.9), subordinate clause
markers (§4.10), the enumerator (§4.11), and interjections (§4.12). In each section, I will
first give the morphological characteristics (if present) of a word class, followed by
syntactic criteria in cases where morphological criteria alone are not sufficient.
There are some instances where the classes overlap. For instance, in the class of
numerals (§4.6), inalienably possessed nouns that refer to body parts, such as atem
‘hand/arm’ and krem ‘finger/toe’ (§4.3.1) are used. The demonstrative forms (§4.4)
comprise demonstrative prefixes, and some of these prefixes are also used on interrogative
forms (§4.5). The two location markers to ‘LOC’ and wo ‘LOC.GEN’ (§4.8.1) seem to be
related to demonstrative prefixes (§4.4). Likewise, the morpheme ro, which marks relative
clauses (§4.10.1), and the forms wo-re and fi-re, which mark locative and manner
adverbial clauses respectively (§4.10.2), all include morphemes that are related to
demonstrative forms. In other words, a morpheme cannot always be assigned to one single
word class.
4.1 Person deixis
Person deixis is expressed through bound personal pronouns in the form of person
prefixes on verbs and inalienably possessed nouns, and through free personal pronouns.
The free personal pronouns can be affixed with ro- ‘POSS’ and po- ‘EMPH’ to form
possessive and emphatic personal pronouns. In some emphatic forms, a numeral is used to
express person deixis. Syntactically, pronouns may be used in the place of a noun or a
noun phrase.
In §4.1.1, I will discuss the person prefixes. Following this, in §4.1.2, the possessive
pronouns are presented. In §4.1.3 the emphatic forms are introduced. Finally, in §4.1.4, I
will give other pronominal forms.
4.1.1 Person prefixes
In §3.1, I introduced the person prefixes, and the morphophonological constraints that
dictate whether or not they are phonologically expressed. The person prefixes are repeated
below:
(1)
S1
2
3M
3Ufree form
tuo
nuo
ait
aubound form
tnym-P1
2
3amu
anu
anapnm-Word classes63Possibly, the first and second person singular bound forms are derived from the
respective free forms. For the other forms, there does not seem to be an overt
morphological connection between the bound forms and the free forms. In the free forms
of the plural pronouns, the first phoneme is invariably /a/, while the second is a nasal.
Person prefixes are taken by verbs and inalienably possessed nouns. There is subject
agreement, that is in clauses the person prefix on the verb must be coreferent with the
subject of the clause — see an example in (2) — and inalienably possessed nouns take a
person prefix that agrees with the possessor of the noun (3).
(2) a.ait y-amo
3M 3M-go
‘he goes’b.nuo n-amo
2S 2-go
‘you go’(3) a.t-ana
1S-head
‘my head’b.y-ana
3M-head
‘his head’Because words from two different word classes take these person prefixes, the presence
of a person prefix cannot be used as the sole criterion to classify a word. Therefore,
syntactic criteria are needed as well, as will be illustrated in the course of the discussion on
verbs and nouns.
There is a distinction in gender, namely between masculine and unmarked in the third
person singular pronoun in both the free forms and the bound forms. Gender is according
to natural gender: masculine is used for male human and, for instance in fables, male
animate. In both cases, the referent must be singular:
(4)rae y-amo aya1
man 3M-go water
‘The man goes to the river.’(5)fane y-tien
pig 3M-sleep
‘The boar sleeps.’The unmarked bound form m- is used to refer to all third person forms that do not fall
under the heading ‘masculine human singular’, that is all other third person singular and
plural forms. Some examples:
(6)fai
m-haif
rako2
woman 3U-chop firewood
‘The woman/women chop(s) firewood.’(7)ru m-amo Senopi
bird 3U-go Senopi
‘The aeroplane/aeroplanes3 go(es) to Senopi.’(8)fane m-aku
m-som
pig 3U-small 3U-play
‘The piglet/piglets play(s).’1
2
3Aya is used to refer to ‘water’ and ‘river’. In this work, I have translated aya as ‘water’.
Rako is a lexicalised compound noun, consisting of the noun ara ‘wood’ and the verb -ko ‘burn’.
Ru ‘bird’ is also used to refer to ‘aeroplane’.","[78, 79, 80, 81]"

m-ata tiya
1S-give money 3U-leaf how.many
‘How many banknotes should I give?’The interrogative ro-yo ‘which one’ (REL-INT) follows the head noun about which more
information is requested. This follows the regular pattern of RCs, in which the head noun
is followed by the RC marker ro and the relativised clause (see §5.3). Some examples are:

The temporal question word titiya ‘when’ invariably occurs in clause-initial position,
which is where the temporal periphery is normally located (see §6.8.1). Examples
involving titiya are given below. In (36) the comma indicates the beginning of a new
clause. In (37), the object po-kuo r-anu re-f-o has been fronted (see §6.4 on objects).

7.1.3.3 Location
The location question words to-yo ‘where’ (area.N-INT), wo-yo ‘where’ (area.GEN-INT)
and mi-yo ‘where’ (PRESTT-INT) occur in clause-final position, like the location periphery.
Some examples involving to-yo are given in (38)–(40). Recall that the location marker tois used to refer to a specific area, that is one that can be pinpointed, as opposed to wo-,
which refers to a more general area. The form mi- is used for presentative forms. The
reader is referred to §4.5 for a more detailed discussion of the differences in meaning
between these three interrogative forms.

Like manner adverbials, the manner interrogative fi-ye occupies the clause-final
position:10
8This sentence is taken out of a text which gives a description of what will happen to the land if the secret
of Wuon, i.e. the initiation ritual for men, is discovered by outsiders.
9
This is possibly a compound form, including -oa ‘not know’. Compare srohni ‘forget’, in which sroh is
‘forget’. Both forms include ni as a final element. The element ha in -oa hani is unattested in the data.
10
The example below is taken from a letter written to me when I was in Ayawasi. The sentence may be a
direct translation from Indonesian, which would account for the fact that fi-ye occurs in clause-initial
position: the corresponding Indonesian bagaimana ‘how’ would also occupy the clause-initial position.

‘And in the end how will it be, in the end how will it be?’The word wo-yo, which usually functions as a location question word, can also function
as a manner question word, in which case it is translated as ‘how’:11
(51)m-orie12 t-no wo-yo
3U-now 1S-do LOC.GEN-INT
‘How shall I do it?’7.2 Imperative
The function of the imperative is to give commands or instructions. There are two ways
of forming the imperative. The first type of imperative is marked phonologically: the
speaker used a loud voice in order to give emphasis to the utterance. There are no syntactic
markers. Some examples:
(52)n-ait
2-eat
‘Eat!’(53)n-iit
2-eat.P
‘Eat (plural)!’(54)n-ama amah
2-come house
‘Come to the house!’(55)n-ama ø-srot
2-come ø-quickly
‘Come quickly!’The second type of imperative is characterised by the presence of the focus adverb re in
clause-final position. Imperatives formed with re are milder than the intonationally marked
imperatives discussed above. The difference between the two types of imperative is
illustrated in examples (56) and (52):11This was the only example wo-yo ‘how’: it may be an exception to the rule, although the example was
checked with different people, and invariably translated as indicated.
12
The form m-orie is attested in the data a few times. I assume that it is a predicative form of the temporal
adverb orie ‘later’. Thus, m-orie constitutes a clause, in which m- functions as a person prefix.","[199, 200, 201, 202]"
"Word classes123categorial status of a form may be unclear. This would explain why the prepositions akah
and ete can occur both in front of a noun, which is typically prepositional behaviour, and
following a noun, parallelling the behaviour of inalienably possessed nouns. Processes
whereby nouns that semantically refer to space undergo a change in morphosyntactic status
are well attested in other languages (cf. Heine et al. 1991:3, 136; Svorou 1993:100–101).
But akah and ete are not the only forms that show ‘prepositional’ behaviour. In the
previous sections, I showed that ‘to’, ‘to+directional’ and ‘to+spatial noun’ can all be
followed by a noun. A summary of forms is given below:
(344)y-amo to

3M-go LOC Sorong
‘He goes to Sorong.’(345)au ø-hren to-tis

LOC-behind house
‘She sits behind the house.’(346)t-se
to
m-ato
lemari
1S-place LOC 3U-hole cupboard
‘I place it inside the cupboard.’4.9 Coordinators
Coordinators are words that are used to link clauses. In Maybrat, the following
coordinators can be identified:
(347)mati
na
ke
mi
re‘and then’
‘and then’
‘because’
‘so that’
‘in order to’These coordinators all occur as free morphemes. Semantically, mati and na indicate
sequentiality of actions; ke, mi and re mark purpose and reason relationships between
clauses. Some examples of these coordinators in a sentence are:
(348)t-amo Sorong mati
ø-tim am
1S-go Sorong and.then ø-send letter
‘I go to Sorong and then I send a letter.’(349)m-aut

1S-go house ø-ill
‘I go to the hospital in order for the sister to look at my foot.’The syntactic behaviour of coordinators is further discussed in §9.1.
4.10 Subordinate clause markers
There are two types of subordinate clause markers, namely a relative clause (RC)
marker and adverbial clause markers.
4.10.1 Relative clauses
Relative clauses follow a noun head, and are marked by ro. An example is:
(353)aof ro ana m-fat
sago REL 3P 3U-fell
‘the sago tree that they fell’The RC marker ro in these constructions is homophonous to the possessive marker ro,
(see §4.1.2).
(354)amah ro-Yan
house POSS-Yan
‘Yan’s house’It is possible that the possessive marker ro- and the RC marker ro are related. Both may
in turn be related to the demonstrative prefixes re-/ro-. I will discuss the possible
relationship between these re’s and ro’s in §5.4, after a detailed description of possessive
constructions and relative clause constructions.
4.10.2 Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clauses are those that modify a main clause. There are three types of
adverbial clauses in Maybrat, namely temporal adverbial clauses, locative adverbial
clauses and manner adverbial clauses. All these clauses are marked by an adverbial clause
marker. There are two forms that have as their sole function to mark adverbial clauses,
namely the locative adverbial clause marker wo-re and the manner adverbial clause marker
fi-re. An example of each is presented below:
(355)ana m-suoh wo-re
fra m-hu
3P 3U-clean LOC.GEN-PART stone 3U-stay
‘They clean where the stone is.’(356)n-fot
fi-re
tuo t-fot
fi-f-o
2-catch similar.to-PART 1S 1S-catch similar.to-very.near-U
‘Catch it like I catch it, like this.’The element wo- in wo-re is obviously related to the demonstrative prefix we-, which
also expresses location. Likewise, fi- in fi-re is related to the demonstrative prefix fi-, given
that they are formally and semantically identical. It is possible that the element -re in wo-reWord classes125and fi-re is related to the demonstrative prefix re-. The possible relationship between these
elements is considered in §9.2.1, after the discussion on temporal adverbial clauses.
Other forms that can function as adverbial clause markers are derived from other word
classes. For instance, to-yo and wo-yo, formally interrogatives, can also function as
locative adverbial clause markers. An example is:
(357)men
tuo t-not
yoyo
wo-yo
t-amo
tomorrow 1s 1s-think continuously location.GEN-INT 1s-go
‘Tomorrow I will continuously think (of you) wherever I go.’Adverbial clauses, and their markers, are discussed in §9.2.
4.11 Enumerator
The class of enumerators comprises only one element, namely o ‘ENUM’. The element o
is used in enumerations, that is when listing items or events. The element o intonationally
occurs in constituent-final position, and a small pause separates o and the following NP.
The element o need not necessarily occur in the last NP in an enumeration. This is
illustrated in (358):69
(358)t-ao
o
# t-ano
o
# ku
ø-kiniah m-ama
1S-sibling.SS ENUM
1S-sibling.OS ENUM
child ø-small 3U-come
‘My siblings of the same sex, my siblings of the opposite sex, small children,
they come.’The element o can also function as a coordinating conjunction between two clauses:
(359)na
m-kuk
intape o
m-kuk ara o
and.then 3U-pull rope
ENUM 3U-pull tree ENUM
‘Then he pulls a rope and he pulls a tree.’4.12 Interjections and particles
There are a number of forms that are commonly used as interjections, that is forms that
do not enter into a syntactic relation of any kind (Crystal 1991:180). Intonationally,
interjections are followed by a pause. Some are given below, with their approximate
meanings:
(360)ae
e
ehe
ka
pa
a‘yes’
‘hey’
‘no’
‘eh?’
‘eh’
‘mmm’Some examples are:69In some dialects, when eliciting words from a list (for instance during surveys), o is added by informants
after each reply given. In this context, the pitch drops sharply on the o, indicating that o is in utterancefinal position.","[140, 141, 142, 143]"

Movement processes such as relativisation can be used to establish the syntactic
behaviour of different types of constructions. In §5.3, I illustrated that in sentences
consisting of a single-verb clause, there are two syntactic positions that can be relativised
on, namely the subject and the object. In the present section I will discuss the behaviour of
coordinating sequences of verbs under relativisation.
When the objects of (16) and (14) are extracted, the results are anomalous.
(23)*naf
ro ø-satoh
Ø kmuk
awiah m-siar
taro.shoot REL ø-collect.belongings
ø-cut.short taro 3U-many
*‘The taro shoots that he collects and he cuts a lot of taro are many.’(24)*biskui ro ku
y-awia rae
m-e
m-aku
biscuit REL child 3M-cry person 3U-give 3U-small
*‘The biscuit that the boy cries and someone gives is small.’Semantically, in example (23), the head noun of the RC, naf, is understood to be the
‘topic’ of kmuk awiah. The same is true for biskui in (24). This gives rise to a ‘logical
conflict’ in the sentence. A ‘logical conflict’ is a situation where the speaker’s empathy, or
identification, with the events described in the sentence is disturbed (cf. Kuno & Kaburaki
1977:628, 645).
This semantic explanation can also be formulated as a syntactic one, namely that it is
not possible to extract objects out of a coordinating structure. This generalisation was
coined by Ross (1967), and is called the Coordinate Structure Constraint (CSC). Given that
these constructions are coordinating, I assume on the basis of the examples above, that
Ross’ CSC is valid for Maybrat, and can be used as a criterion for distinguishing
coordinating constructions from non-coordinating ones.
8.2 Adverbial verbs
Apart from coordinating constructions of verbs, another type of verb sequence can be
identified, which I will refer to as adverbial verbs, following their semantic characteristics,
namely to modify or specify an event expressed by a verb (see §4.7). There are two types
of adverbial verbs: the first type occurs as a bare-stem verb when it follows a verb that it
modifies. Constructions involving this type of verb are very rare indeed in Maybrat: their
occurrence in the data is limited to the examples presented in this section.6 The second type
is the verb -o ‘take’, which expresses modality when it occurs as the first verb in a
sequence.
6Of course the criterion of omission of a prefix on a second verb is not valid for hypothetical cases where a
covert person prefix occurs. In other words, adverbial verbs that have a bisyllabic stem may exist.
However, no semantic, phonological or syntactic evidence has been found to prove the existence of these
forms.","[209, 210]"
"232Chapter 9It is possible that the coordinator re is related to the demonstrative prefix re‘location.SPEC’. The pragmatic function of the coordinator re may be interpreted as
marking a ‘topic’, or a ‘given’ according to which an action is carried out. Coordinators
that mark semantic categories such as purpose, cause, reason or conditionals often derive
from demonstrative elements, as attested in many languages. Some examples from
Germanic languages are the Old English coordinator for þaem ‘for that, because’ (Traugott
1985:297), English coordinator so that; the Dutch coordinator omdat ‘because, as’
containing dat ‘that’; and daarom and daardoor ‘therefore, so’ both containing the
demonstrative daar ‘there’. In a broad pragmatic sense each of these coordinators mark the
preceding clause as a ‘given’ in the discourse.
9.1.5 Cause/Reason
There are two coordinators indicating cause or reason, namely mi ‘so that’ and ke
‘because’. Intonationally, mi occurs in clause-initial position. Some examples are:
(42)tuo t-awe ku
y-hai awiáh / mi
y-awià
1S 1S-say child 3M-die taro
so.that 3M-cry
‘I think the child is hungry so that he is crying.’(43)n-no fi-yé
/ mi
n-ao
ø-yàf
2-do similar.to-INT
so.that 2-foot ø-wound
‘What did you do, so that your foot is wounded?’(44)t-haf
m-nok-nók
/ mi
t-awe ø-hawe t-ait po-iìt
1S-stomach 3U-queasy-REDUP
so.that 1S-say ø-refuse 1S-eat NOM-eat.P
‘I feel queasy, so that I think I don’t want to eat food.’Sentences with mi can also be interpreted as conditionals, depending on the context in
which the utterance occurs. This similarity in form between causals and conditionals
reflects their semantic similarity. In conditionals in natural languages, it must be possible
to interpret the content of the protasis as a cause of the content of the apodosis. So, there is
a causal link between the protasis and the apodosis (Comrie 1986:80). In a conditional
interpretation, mi marks the following clause as the apodosis. There are no syntactic or
intonational criteria to make a formal distinction between mi as a coordinator meaning ‘so
that’ and mi marking the apodosis of a conditional structure. Some (elicited) examples:
(45)om m-aís
/ mi
ku
ø-kiniah m-pat
rapuoh m-amà
rain 3U-descend so.that child ø-small 3U-from forest 3U-come
‘It rains, so the small children come from the forest.’ Or: ‘If it rains, the
small children will come from the forest.’(46)t-hai
awiáh / mi
t-aìt
1S-die taro
so.that 1S-eat
‘I am hungry, so I eat.’ Or: ‘If I’m hungry, I will eat.’(47)ru m-amá / mi
t-hu
au
ø-saka
rae ø-srièm
bird 3U-come
so.that 1S-stay DIST.U ø-pick.up {person ø-visit}
‘The aeroplane will come, so I will wait there and pick up the visitor.’ Or:
‘If the aeroplane comes, I will wait there and pick up the visitor.’Complex constructions 233
Like the coordinator re, mi may be related to a demonstrative prefix, namely me‘PRESTT’. However, this is rather unlikely, since the coordinator mi and the demonstrative
prefix me- are not homophonous (the coordinator re and the demonstrative prefix re- are).
Example (48) is in minimal opposition with (40), repeated below as (49). These
examples illustrate how both re and mi can be used to express a causal relationship.
(48)t-amo orá
/ mi
orie mti
p-iit
ara sasù
1S-go garden
so.that later night 1P-eat.P {cassava}
‘I will go to the garden, so that tonight we will eat cassava.’(49)t-amo orá
/ re
orie mti
p-iit
ara sasù
1S-go garden in.order.to later night 1P-eat.P {cassava}
‘I will go to the garden, so that tonight we eat cassava.’The coordinator ke ‘because of’ and mi ‘so that’ are each other’s mirror-image:
‘Clause1 ke Clause2’ means ‘Clause1 because of Clause2’, while ‘Clause1 mi Clause2’
means ‘because of Clause1, Clause2’.
Like re and mi, ke ‘because of’ occurs in clause-initial position. Some examples are:
(50)Potafit ait y-apo fé

okaìr
Potafit 3M 3M-eat NEG

‘Potafit, he didn’t eat because it (the food) is a little.’(51)Pastor y-hu

‘The Father stayed and observed and said, “Come, because tomorrow the
aeroplane will come.”’In the following example, the first ke occurs in sentence-initial position, that is ke is
preceded by a long pause and a sharp drop in pitch on the last stressed syllable preceding
ke.

you don’t go and marry women from there (i.e. a different place) because then
you let go of your in-laws, our women and our in-laws are on friendly terms (lit.
‘greet each other’).’
The clause marked by ke can refer to an actual event or to a hypothetical event. The
contrast between actual and hypothetical depends on the context in which the utterance
occurs. There are no morphological or syntactic criteria for making this distinction. In
examples (50)–(51) above the clause following ke refers to an actual event. In the two
examples below, the reason is hypothetical:234

‘Go carefully because you might fall.’9.1.6 Simultaneity
When si ‘also’ (see §4.7.6) occurs in clause-final position in each clause in a sequence
of two clauses, it expresses simultaneity:
(55)tuo tutup kios si,
ana tutup amah ø-kiyam si
1S close store also 3P

‘While I close the store, they close the hospital.’(56)nuo n-kom am n-e

‘You write a letter and give it to me, and at the same time I will write a letter
and give it to you.’ (implication: we write to each other)9.2 Adverbial clauses
As mentioned in §4.10.2, a distinction can be made between three types of adverbial
clauses in Maybrat, namely temporal adverbial clauses, locative adverbial clauses and
manner adverbial clauses. The function of adverbial clauses is to modify the main clause.
All adverbial clauses are introduced by a marker.
In many ways, adverbial clauses and RCs are similar. In §5.4, I showed that the RC
marker ro is possibly related to the demonstrative prefix re-. As will be illustrated in this
section, adverbial clause markers might also be related to, or contain forms that are related
to, demonstratives and question words. This homogeneity in markers can be explained in
functional terms: both RCs and adverbial clauses are modifiers which function as specifiers
or determiners; RCs restrict the potential referent of a noun, and adverbial clauses specify
the circumstances of an event (Dik 1997:84). In both cases, the marker that introduces
them functions as a kind of ‘traffic sign’ to interpret the following clausal construction.
Given this functional similarity, it is not odd that the markers that introduce these clausal
constructions derive from forms which functionally determine or specify a referent, namely
demonstratives and interrogatives. This tendency is also common in other languages (cf.
Hopper & Traugott 1993:195–196; Dik 1997:80).
Formally, temporal adverbial clauses are structurally completely parallel to RCs in that
they have a (nominal) head followed by a marker and a restricting clause. Locative and
manner adverbial clauses do not have a nominal ‘head’, but do have a marker followed by
a restricting clause, which modifes the main clause. In all cases the marker seems to
contain at least one element that is associated with a clearly nominal function, that is the
prefix re- or we-, or the interrogative form p-awiya ‘what’. This reflects the nominalComplex constructions 235
character of all these clauses, which is also common in functionally similar constructions
in other languages (see for instance, Dik 1997:87).
9.2.1 Temporal adverbials
There are two types of temporal adverbial clauses, namely those introduced by um ro
‘the moment (SPEC)’ and those marked by kine wo ‘the time (GEN)’. Temporal adverbial
clauses are only attested in sentence-initial position. Some examples are:
(57)um
ro y-roh
re-t-o
Hari Selasa
moment REL 3M-descend location.SPEC-near-U {Tuesday}
‘The moment he descended it was Tuesday.’(58)um
ro m-fit-fit
t-a
ø-sikat m-roh
moment REL 3U-yank.grass-REDUP near-U ø-thirsty 3U-descend
m-amo m-atuah asam kek
3U-go 3U-cut {red sugarcane}
‘The moment she was weeding, she got thirsty, she went down and cut
some red sugarcane.’(59)kine wo t-amo Sorong ø-tim am
time REL 1S-go Sorong ø-send letter
‘When I go down to Sorong, I will send a letter.’(60)kine wo ø-spis am
m-suoh
yu ø-siwia
time REL ø-sew rain.cape 3U-weave bag ø-tie
‘The time when they sewed rain capes, they (also) wove bags and they tied them.’The difference between forms including um ro and kine wo is one of specificity: in (58),
for example, the moment at which the woman gets thirsty can be pinpointed. Conversely,
in (59) the moment of going to Sorong is non-specific: the use of kine wo implies that no
concrete plan has been made yet. The difference between forms including ro and wo
referring to specific and non-specific respectively is the same as demonstrative forms
including the prefixes re- and we-, which also contrast for specificity. Given the similarity
in consonants between these forms, it is well possible that these ro/re- and wo/we- are
related to each other.
In the examples above, I have glossed ro and wo as ‘REL’ (relativiser). The reason for
this is that temporal adverbial clauses are formally parallel to RCs, as demonstrated below:
(61) gives an RC, whereas (62) gives a temporal adverbial clause. Structural similarity
between RCs and adverbial clauses is a common feature in languages (Foley 1986:202;
Thompson & Longacre 1985:178). In some Papuan languages, RCs and adverbial clauses
are formally identical, and can only be distinguished depending on the context in which
they appear, that is in Korowai (van Enk & de Vries 1997:115).
(61)rae
ro y-amo Sorong ø-kiyam m-ase
person REL 3M-go Sorong ø-ill
3U-very
‘The person who is going to Sorong is very ill.’(62)um
ro ana m-roh
rae
m-suoh
moment REL 3P 3U-descend person 3U-dance
‘When they come down, the people dance.’236Chapter 9That RCs and temporal adverbial clauses are similar also appears from their nominal
properties: like RCs, temporal adverbials are able to take a nominal demonstrative as a
modifier. This is illustrated in example (57) above, where the demonstrative re-t-o marks
the end of the NP, and Hari Selasa ‘Tuesday’ functions as a verbless clause. In (58) above,
the demonstrative t-a (a dialectal variant of t-o) occupies the final position in the NP.
Intonationally, sentences involving temporal adverbial clauses and RCs are also similar:
in both there is a slight rise in pitch on the last syllable of the clause. There is no explicit
pause preceding the main clause, but there is a small ‘hold-up’ (indicated ‘||’) to mark the
beginning of the main information clause — (61) and (62) are repeated as (63) and (64)
respectively:
(63)rae
ro y-amo Soróng || ø-kiyam m-asè /
person REL 3M-go Sorong
ø-ill
3U-very
‘The persn who goes to Sorong is very ill.’(64)um
ro ana m-róh
|| rae
m-suòh /
moment REL 3P 3U-descend person 3U-dance
‘When they come down, the people dance.’9.2.2 Locative adverbials
Locative adverbial clauses can be introduced by the following markers:
(65)wo
wo-yo
wo-relocation.GEN
location.GEN-INT
location.GEN-PARTAll the locative adverbial clause markers incorporate the element wo-.17 In §4.5, I
illustrated that the demonstrative prefix we-/wo- and the interrogative prefix wo- are
related: they are both generic location markers. The element wo- in the adverbial clause
markers is not only formally similar to the generic location marker wo, and to the
demonstrative prefix we-/wo-, but all these markers are semantically similar: they
conceptually refer to ‘location’ in a generic sense. Therefore, I conclude that wo- in the
location markers is related to the generic location marker wo, and to the demonstrative
prefix we-/wo-.18
Examples of locative adverbial clause markers introduced by wo appear below:
(66)m-amo ø-sko
wo
m-atia
m-me
m-ape
ana
3U-go ø-clean.out location.GEN 3U-father 3U-mother 3U-give.birth 3P
‘They go and clean them (the intestines) where their father and mother gave
birth to them.’Locative adverbial clauses introduced by wo-yo ‘where’ are given in examples (67) and
(68). Recall that wo-yo is formally a question word.","[249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]"
"Word classes
(105)tuo t-amo t-kah

1S 1S-go 1S-wear clothes
‘I go and I wear clothes.’(106)y-ama
y-kah
po-ø-fayir
3M-come 3M-wear NOM-ø-decorate
‘He comes and he wears decorations.’81It is conceivable that -kah ‘wear’ and -kah in the meaning ‘with’ derive from one single
morpheme, given their semantic similarity: a less fluent English translation of (106), for
example, could be ‘He comes and he is with decorations’, but both meanings are closely
related. I therefore assume that there is a link between -kah ‘wear’ and -kah ‘with’. It is not
clear, however, how -kah ‘with’ has come to include a recipient and benefactive function
as well, that is, if we assume that they are one and the same morpheme.
Third, unlike transitive verbs, from which an object can be omitted, prepositional verbs
invariably occur with an object. Omitting this object results in an ungrammatical utterance,
see (107b).
(107) a.b.m-ama
m-pat
Mosun
3U-come 3U-from Mosun
‘They come from Mosun.’
*m-ama m-pat
3U-come 3U-fromThus, prepositional verbs seem to be less ‘verby’ than other transitive verbs. As such,
their verbal status is questionable. The syntactic behaviour of prepositional verbs is
described in detail in §8.4.
4.2.3.6 Comitative
The comitative, marked by the verb -sia, is used to conjoin NPs. Adequate translations
of -sia are ‘and’, ‘with’ or ‘accompanied by’. When -sia takes both a subject and an object,
the resulting constituent can function as an argument in a clause. An example is given in
(108), where tuo t-sia ait functions as the subject of the predicate p-mo.
(108)tuo t-sia
ait p-mo Mosun
1S 1S-with 3M 1P-go.P Mosun
‘I go to Mosun with him.’ (lit. ‘I with him, we go to Mosun.’)(109)t-amo Mosun t-sia
Lys
1S-go Mosun 1S-with Lys
‘I go to Mosun with Lys.’The verb -sia is similar to the verbs expressing oblique notions in two ways: -sia cannot
function as a main verb, and -sia rarely occurs without an object. The morphological and
syntactic properties of -sia are described in detail in §8.5.
4.2.4 Derivation on verbs: -iThe derivational affix -i- ‘TRANS’ changes the valency of verbs from intransitive to
transitive. This affix in turn takes a person prefix that must be coreferent with the subject82Chapter 4of the following verb. Therefore, it is possible that -i- has a verbal origin. The affix -i also
occurs as an independent verb meaning ‘tie’, as in (110), but it seems unlikely that the
form -i- in the sequence -i- + V is semantically related to -i ‘tie’.
(110)ait y-i
fane m-ao
3M 3M-tie pig 3U-leg
‘He ties the pig’s leg.’Derivation with -i- applies to a restricted number of verbs only, and does not seem to be
productive. There are two types of verbs that can undergo derivation with -i-, which are
given below:
To begin, -i- can precede verbs that semantically refer to ‘break’:
(111)-tie
ktus
ftah‘break (sticks)’
‘break (ropes)’
‘break (shells)’Below, in the a-forms the verbs are used intransitively, while in the b-forms they
function as transitive verbs. These verbs must take a derivational affix -i- when functioning
as transitive verbs, as in (114), derived from (112b), which is ungrammatical.

unmarked with respect to gender. Therefore the person prefix on the following adjectival
verbs is m-.
Nouns are never marked for number. Hence, fane ‘pig’ can refer to one or to more pigs.
Likewise, m-atem can mean ‘her hand’ or ‘her hands’, and y-fain can mean ‘his wife’ or
‘his wives’. Whether a noun has one or more referents must be inferred from the context in
which the noun is used.
4.3.4 Derivation of nouns
In Maybrat, there are three different ways in which verbs can be nominalised. I will
refer to these as objective nominalisation, instrumental nominalisation, and agentive
nominalisation (Comrie & Thompson 1985:351–356). These terms are semantically
motivated: they refer to the type of noun that is produced in nominalisation. For instance,
in instrumental nominalisation nouns which mean ‘an instrument for “verbing”’ are
derived. In addition to these three types of nominalisation processes, two more can be
identified: ‘noun-to-noun’ nominalisation (Comrie & Thompson 1985:395) and ‘adverb-tonoun’ nominalisation.
What all these processes have in common is that nominalisation is effected by prefixing
po ‘thing’ to a following verb form or noun. In this process, po functions as a nominaliser,
and will appear as po- in the texts and glossed as NOM. This is done to distinguish
nominalised forms from homophonous forms that constitute clauses (see (176)–(178)
below). Nominalised forms conform to the criterion for word-hood in that they cannot be
broken up by a pause without rendering the utterance ungrammatical or changing the
meaning of the utterance. In this section I will only discuss lexical nominalisation, andWord classes91mention clausal nominalisation in passing, to illustrate my point. Clausal nominalisation,
that is relativisation, will be treated in detail in §6.7.
In objective and instrumental nominalisation po- is prefixed to a bare verb stem. Via
objective nominalisation, nouns are formed which mean ‘a thing we “verb”’. It is the
first/second person plural verb stem that is used in this type of nominalisation, as
illustrated in (168) and (169). Some examples:
(167)po-kah
NOM-burn‘garden’ (lit. ‘thing we burn’)
(168)po-iit
NOM-eat.P
‘food’ (lit. ‘thing we eat’)(169)po-kuo
NOM-feast.P
‘feast’ (lit. ‘thing we feast’)(170)po-hren
NOM-sit
‘chair’ (lit. ‘thing we sit (on)’)I assume that the form in (171) is also an instance of objective nominalisation, although
the putative verbal form *mna ‘tell tale’ is unattested in the data:
(171)po-mna
NOM-tell.tale
‘tale’In instrumental nominalisation, the resulting noun means ‘an instrument for “verbing”’
(see Comrie & Thompson 1985:353). An example follows:
(172)po-kom
NOM-write‘pen’ (lit. ‘instrument for writing’)
In agentive nominalisation, nouns meaning ‘a thing which “verbs”’ are derived from
verbs. These verbs take a third person unmarked person prefix, except when they cannot do
so due to morphophonological constraints. Some examples follow:
(173)po-m-haf
25NOM-3U-pregnant‘pumpkin’ (lit. ‘thing that is pregnant’)
(174)po-m-afit
NOM-3U-bite‘mosquito’ (lit. ‘thing that bites’)
(175)po-ø-safom
NOM-ø-green‘grass’ (lit. ‘thing that is green’)
25The form -haf has two functions: as an inalienably possessed noun it means ‘belly’, and as a verb it means
‘pregnant’. The two forms are arguably related.","[107, 108, 109]"
"1IntroductionMaybrat is a Papuan language which is spoken in the central area of the Bird’s Head
Peninsula, Papua Province, Indonesia. The total number of speakers is approximately
22,000 (Brown 1991:1). Despite the fact that it is one of the larger local languages in
Papua Province in terms of numbers of speakers, a comprehensive grammar on this
language has hitherto not been published. The objective of the present study is to provide a
detailed linguistic description of the phonology, morphology, syntax and features of
discourse of Maybrat. The data for this study were collected over a period of two years in
Ayawasi, a village in central Bird’s Head.
In this chapter some background information on the language and its speakers is given,
namely a description of the geography, demography, and administration (§1.1), the history
(§1.2), the people (§1.3), the linguistic scene (§1.4), previous studies (§1.5), the language
(§1.6) and the dialects (§1.7). The final section of this introductory chapter gives an
account of the fieldwork.
1.1 Geography, demography, and administration
The Bird’s Head Peninsula called Kepala Burung in Indonesian, is situated on the
westernmost part of the island of New Guinea, between 0° and 2°20´ southern latitude and
between 130° and 134°20´ eastern longitude. The elevation of the peninsula forms a
gradual decreasing slope: the northern part is taken up by the Tamrau mountain range, with
peaks rising up to 3000 m, while the Arfak mountains constitute the eastern part of the
peninsula. In the centre the mountains rise from 800 m in the west to 2800 m in the east.
To the south of this area the land gradually drops towards the Ayamaru lakes.
Geologically, the area around the Ayamaru lakes is characterised by tropical karst
formations. The area along the MacCluer Gulf and Bintuni Bay constitutes a low swampy
area with large river systems. The entire Bird’s Head is covered in tropical rainforest and
secondary forest.
There are two major townships in the Bird’s Head: Sorong, which is the largest town,
on the north-western tip; and Manokwari on the north-eastern tip. Smaller townships are
Ransiki on the east coast; and on the south coast Bintuni (formerly Steenkool), Inanwatan
and Teminabuan. These townships are inhabited by the indigenous population, as well as
by large numbers of people from other parts of Indonesia. Also, there are a few
transmigration areas, inhabited by transmigrants from Java and other overpopulated parts
of Indonesia, outside Sorong and Manokwari. Some densely populated areas in the interior
12Chapter 1are Ayawasi (approximately 1200 inhabitants) and the area around the Ayamaru lakes
(approximately 17,000, Brown 1991:1), the Kebar plains and the Anggi lakes. These areas
are inhabited mainly by the indigenous population. Apart from the densely populated areas,
small villages, almost exclusively inhabited by the indigenous population, are scattered
throughout the peninsula. In 1985, the total number of indigenous inhabitants of the Bird’s
Head was approximated at 100,000.1
Administratively, the Bird’s Head is divided into two kabupatens (regencies): the
western half of the peninsula belongs to kabupaten Sorong, and the eastern half to
kabupaten Manokwari. These kabupatens are subdivided into a number of kecamatans
(subregencies).
Ayawasi, the site of research for the present study, falls under kabupaten Sorong,
kecamatan Ayfat. It is located in the central Bird’s Head peninsula, at 1°10´ southern
latitude and 132°27´ eastern longitude. It is located at an elevation of 450 m. The average
temperatures are between 25°C and 30°C during the daytime, and around 20°C at night.
There is 5,500–6,000 mm of rain per year: rainfall is highest in May and June, and lowest
in December and January. Ayawasi is situated at the centre of the Ayfat region.
1.2 History
The prehistory of the Bird’s Head is sketchy at best. Radiocarbon dating of
archaeological finds suggests that migrations from eastern Indonesia towards Australia and
New Guinea occurred as early as 40,000 years Before Present (BP), or even earlier
(Bellwood et al. 1998:233). It is possible that in this period the Bird’s Head peninsula was
a landing place for migrants crossing to present-day Papua Province, Papua New Guinea
and Australia (Jelsma 1998:41, refers to Birdsell 1977), but no evidence of this has been
found in the Bird’s Head. However, recent archaeological research by Pasveer in a cave
near the Ayamaru lakes revealed that human occupation in this area goes back to at least
8000 years ago (Pasveer 1998:86).2
Until well into the 20th century, the population in the Bird’s Head was seminomadic:
the inhabitants lived in gardens which were made by clearing part of the forest. If one
garden was exhausted, they abandoned it and made a new garden. In addition to gardening,
they hunted and gathered food in the forest to supplement their diet. People lived together
in clans, and made their gardens on their ancestral grounds (Schoorl 1979:22). Even today,
especially in the East Ayfat, many people still live in very small groups in the forest, and
hardly ever come to the villages.
Little is known about the history of the interior of the Bird’s Head before 1900. We
know that there were ancient trade routes between China and the Moluccan islands of
Banda and Buru. Evidence in the form of pottery, linen, porcelain, beads and certain types
of treebark (for the preparation of perfumery) suggests this trade extended as far as West
New Guinea (Schoorl 1979:21).
From 1910 onwards, attempts were made by the Dutch colonial government to create
villages in the Bird’s Head. The mission has played an important role in this, helping with
the formation of schools in new villages. In 1911 the first (Protestant) missionaries started

Both Jelsma and Pasveer worked within the framework of ‘The Irian Jaya studies: a programme for
interdisciplinary research (ISIR)’.","[17, 18, 19, 20]"
"72Chapter 4With the exception of some quantifying verbs, none of the other verb classes contain
verbs that can be used attributively. An illustration is given below. In (50a) -asah ‘laugh’ is
used predicatively. The same verb cannot be used attributively in an NP, as illustrated in
(50b).
(50) a.b.fai
re-t-o
m-asah
woman location.SPEC-near-U 3U-laugh
‘This woman laughs.’
*t-kai
fai
m-asah re-t-o
1S-meet woman 3U-laugh location.SPEC-near-UThe fact that the ‘adjectival’ verbs can function attributively in an NP (see §5.1.2) could
be used as an argument to introduce a separate word class ‘adjective’ for Maybrat.
However, this is undesirable because the adjectival verbs retain all the formal
morphological properties of verbs, whether they function predicatively, as in (47a), or
attributively, as in (47b). In addition, the ability to function predicatively is a function
typically associated with verbs. Introducing a separate category ‘adjective’ would conceal
this morphological and functional similarity between verbs and adjectives.
4.2.2.3 Quantifying verbs
Semantically, quantifiers are words that express contrasts in quantity (Crystal
1991:286). As is the case for adjectival notions, Maybrat uses forms that are
morphologically verbs to express quantifying notions. Dik (1987:153) points out that
relative adjectives, such as ‘big’/‘small’, ‘heavy’/‘light’ etc. and relative quantifiers such as
‘many’/‘some’/‘few’ are notionally similar to one another. Thus, it is not surprising that
Maybrat expresses both adjectival notions and quantifiers in one category. The fact that
quantification is expressed through verbs is not exceptional (cf. Schachter 1985:38). Three
of the forms in (51), namely -kak, -tut and -siar are morphologically identical to verbs in
that they take person prefixes.
(51)-kak
prut
pria(n)
-tut
wisau‘absolutely everyone/everything’
‘everyone/everything’
‘everyone/everything’
‘everyone’ (small group)
‘everyone/everything’waro
okair
-siar‘little’
‘little’
‘many’It is difficult to make a clear-cut semantic distinction between some of these quantifiers.
I have attempted to make some contrasts below:
While -kak means ‘absolutely everyone/everything’, as in (52), prut just refers to
‘everything, all’ as in (53). In other words, -kak is more extreme than prut.
(52)m-su
aya m-kak
3U-drown water 3U-absolutely.everyone
‘Every single one of them drowns.’Word classes
(53)73m-ait awiah ø-prut
3U-eat taro ø-everything
‘They eat all the taro.’The difference between prut and pria is that prut primarily refers to inanimates, see
(53), whereas pria primarily refers to animates, see (54)–(55):
(54)m-tien
ø-pria
3U-sleep ø-everyone
‘Everyone sleeps.’(55)m-hu m-ape
ø-pria
3U-stay 3U-give.birth ø-everyone
‘Everyone lives (there) and bears children.’However, in (56) prut refers to animates, while in (57) pria refers to inanimates:
(56)ø-prut
m-nan po-ø-safom
ø-everyone 3U-like NOM-ø-green
‘Everyone (stands) like grass’ (They all stand so close together
that they are like grass.)(57)asam
ø-pria
sugarcane ø-everything
‘all the sugarcane’/‘This is all sugarcane.’These examples illustrate that a clear-cut semantic distinction between prut and pria in
terms of animate and inanimate cannot be made.
Unlike prut and pria, prian ‘everything’ can only refer to inanimates.
(58)m-amo m-hu m-kah ø-prian
3U-go 3U-stay 3U-burn ø-everything
‘They go and they stay there and they burn everything.’The quantifier wisau ‘everything, everyone’ is used for both animates and inanimates. It
refers to a large group, as opposed to -tut ‘everyone’, which can only refer to a small group
of less than ten people. Some examples:
(59)p-tut
p-mo aya
1P-everyone 1P-go.P water
‘We (small group) all go to the river.’(60)rapu
anu ø-wisau
morning 2P ø-everyone
‘Good morning to you all.’The quantifiers okair and waro ‘little’ differ little semantically, but they do have
different syntactic properties: like pria(n) ‘everyone/everything’, okair cannot function as
an attributive in an NP. Apart from clearly showing characteristics of quantifiers, waro can
also function as a temporal adverbial meaning ‘in a little while’ (see §6.8.1). Some
examples in which okair and waro function as quantifiers follow:
(61)rae m-ama m-me
ania
ø-okair
man 3U-come 3U-fight each.other ø-little
‘The people come and they (only) fight each other a little.’74Chapter 4(62)kamean
y-o
mes ø-waro
black.cockatoo 3M-take blood ø-little
‘The black cockatoo takes a little bit of blood.’In conclusion, it seems that there are a number of synonyms or near-synonyms in the
class of quantifying verbs.13
Morphologically, some quantifying verbs take person prefixes:
(63)rae m-kak
man 3U-absolutely.everyone
‘absolutely everyone of the people’/‘There are people everywhere.’(64)anu n-siar
2P
2-many
‘many of you’/‘You are with many.’(65)amu p-tut
1P
1P-everyone
‘everyone of us (incl.)’/‘We (incl.) are with many.’The other quantifiers listed above do not take person prefixes. This, however, does not
exclude the possibility that they are formally verbs. The problem is that they all consist of
two syllables, which, if they were verbs, means that they cannot take person prefixes
because of the morphophonological constraint on bisyllabic words (see §3.1). By analogy
to -kak, -siar and -tut I conclude that the words that express quantifying notions in Maybrat
are formally verbs. They are therefore given a covert person prefix ‘ø-’.
Like adjectival verbs, quantifying verbs can either function attributively or predicatively
(except prian and okair, which can only function predicatively, see above). This is
indicated in the translations of (63)–(65) above. An example where there are syntactic
criteria to determine whether the quantifying verb functions attributively or predicatively
appears below. In (66a) n-siar functions attributively in the NP anu n-siar f-o, where I
assume that the demonstrative fo is the last element in the NP (see Chapter 5, and §5.1.6).
This NP functions as a subject. In (66b) n-siar functions predicatively, its subject is anu
f-o. Intonationally, both examples constitute a clause:
(66) a.b.anu n-siar
f-o
n-mo
2P 2P-many very.near-U 2-go.P
‘The many of you go to the river.’ayà /
riveranu f-o
n-siàr /
2p very.near-U 2-many
‘There are many of you.’Admittedly, there are only a few forms in which a demonstrative is available to prove
the syntactic function of the quantifying verbs. Although (63) has a typically ‘clausal’
intonation pattern, this was not so clear for (64) and (65). In (67) it is not clear what the13This synonymy can possibly be attributed to the fact that these forms are taken from different dialects.
Unfortunately I have been unable to verify this.","[89, 90, 91, 92]"
"140Chapter 55.6 Combinations of noun phrases
In Maybrat, there are three ways of combining NPs, which I will refer to as
juxtaposition, apposition and enumeration.13 Of these, only enumeration is syntactically
marked.
Enumeration involves the placement of the enumerator o (introduced in §4.11) between
two NPs. As mentioned in §4.11, o intonationally belongs to the NP that it follows.
Depending on the context, o is adequately translated as ‘and’ or ‘or’. Some examples
appear below. In an enumeration, o on the last NP in the sequence is not obligatory, as
illustrated in (83).
(81)m-po
to-te
Saweron o
Mosun o
3U-hold LOC-direction.where.sun.sets Saweron ENUM Mosun ENUM
‘They take them along to the east, to Saweron and to Mosun.’(82)to-n-o
Aypokiar o
Esuyoh

‘there at Aypokiar and Esuyoh, there’(83)snie eok o

fi-t-o
m-ape
moon two ENUM three again similar.to-near-U 3U-give.birth
‘Another two or three months, and she will give birth.’to-au14
ENUM LOC-DIST.U
oThe enumerator o can be replaced by a pause without a significant change in meaning,
as indicated in the following minimal pair. In example (84b) the relation between the NPs
is juxtapositional.
(84) a.b.awiah o
po
we-t-o
taro ENUM thing location.GEN-near-U
‘taro and these things’
awiah # po
we-t-o
taro
thing location.GEN-near-U
‘taro and these things’Some examples of juxtaposition were given in (71)–(73), where RCs without a head
occur one after the other. Juxtaposed NPs are not coreferential. They can be adequately
translated into English with ‘NP1 and NP2 and NP3 etc.’. Phonologically, there is always a
(short) pause between two juxtaposed NPs, marked by ‘#’:
(85)12fnia
# rae
ø-kiyam m-ama amah ø-kiyam
woman
person ø-ill
3U-come house ø-ill
‘Ill woman and men came to the hospital.’The verb -awe is used in pseudo-quotative constructions, referring, among others, to ‘thought content’.
See §8.3 and §8.3.1 for a detailed discussion of this verb.
13
Another way of combining NPs is in comitative forms, where two NPs are conjoined with the verb -sia
‘and’ or ‘with’ (introduced in §4.2.3.6). Because this NP conjoining is effected with a verbal form, I will
discuss these structures in the chapter on sequences of verbs (§8.5).
14
This is an example where the demonstrative form to-au is used as a substantive.","[157, 158]"

In Mayhapeh and Karon, there seem to be some differences in the use of person
prefixes: some Karon forms have prefixes where Mayhapeh cognates do not and vice
versa. Compare, for instance, Mayhapeh m-hai <3U-die> with Karon hai ‘They die’. In
Mayhapeh, *hai is an unacceptable form. Similarly in Mayhapeh the inalienably possessed
noun -haf ‘stomach’ always takes a subject prefix (t-haf ‘my stomach’, n-haf ‘your
stomach’ and so on), while Karon haf ‘stomach’ is acceptable. The initial consonant in a
number of Karon forms is homophonous with the third person masculine prefix y-, for
example yauf ‘egg’ (Mayhapeh m-auf); yru ‘They fly’ (<ru ‘bird’) (Mayhapeh fru ‘They
fly’). Some Karon forms noted by Voorhoeve show differences along the same lines, for
example Karon aru yawian vs. Mayhapeh ru mawian ‘bird feathers’ (Voorhoeve pers.
comm., based on fieldnotes).
1.8 Fieldwork
The reason for selecting Ayawasi as a site for fieldwork was threefold. Firstly, Ayawasi,
with its large and almost completely bilingual community, is a good place to collect
language data. Secondly, some anthropological fieldwork had already been conducted in
Ayawasi, resulting in an ethnography (Schoorl 1979, see also §1.5). Thirdly, from a
practical point of view, the people at the missionary post were willing to assist at the
beginning of the fieldwork period, and, Ayawasi has an airstrip providing some access to
the township of Sorong. Because I found many good informants in Ayawasi, I decided to
collect the bulk of my data there.
Fieldwork was conducted in two periods, from September 1993 to February 1995 and
from October 1995 to March 1996. Initially Indonesian was used as the contact language.
A start was made with acquiring a basic knowledge of Maybrat in the form of words,
greetings, short questions that could be asked in the village, and short sentences.
Subsequently, a word list of 700 lexical items was recorded, as well as three short stories.
A number of people were asked to help transcribe and translate the texts. In the meantime,
I acquired enough oral proficiency to conduct conversations.
After having formulated preliminary hypotheses about the phonology, morphology and
syntax of the language, more texts were recorded, transcribed, and translated with the help
of several people. These texts were analysed and any queries were discussed with12Chapter 1informants. The texts were used as the basis for the elicitation of new material:
constructions or features that were not understood, or that required more data, were
elaborated on with informants. Some of this elicitation was done by constructing sentences,
and asking a native speaker to improve them.
Most of the data were entered into two computer databases: for the analysis of the
phonological data the programme ‘FindPhone’ was used and for interlinearising texts the
programme ‘Shoebox’.28 The initial phonological analysis was based on 900 forms in the
database, and was later supplemented by more material. The Shoebox programme
contained over 2700 types of words. Eventually the recorded and written text material
totalled over 45.000 tokens (approximately sixty typed pages).
In addition to the material entered into the digital databases, a concordance was made
by hand, based on the collected texts. This concordance included examples of different
sentence types, instances of lexical items that were not yet fully understood, instances of
the use of different types of words in natural text, for example demonstratives, question
words and so on. The concordance proved practical in elicitation with informants, because
all the information in a particular field, plus the source of that information, was easily
accessible. For instance, when the function and occurrence of a particular deictic element
had to be analysed, examples were taken from the concordance. These examples could
then be used as a basis for further elicitation.
Towards the end of my stay in Ayawasi, much of the elicitation as well as the
transcriptions were done monolingually. This, and conversations conducted and overheard
in the village, proved a valuable source of new data.
The data on which this grammar is based comprises the following material:
stories and myths
These stories include traditional tales, incorporating trickster stories, myths, fables,
children’s stories, speeches (made in Church), travel accounts, conversations, explanations,
historical narratives, and family histories. Some of this material was recorded by others, for
example Han Schoorl and Wanda Avé, and given to me to work out.
written material
When people in Ayawasi realised that I recorded stories and subsequently transcribed
them, they occasionally brought in written material. This material included explanations,
such as how to grow sago; how to hunt and cut up a pig; a number of letters to me
(including an e-mail!); a traditional tale; a list of names of snakes; a list of names of plants;
and a farewell speech written by two villagers and said in church by a parting Brother.
conversations
Some material was recorded, and other material was noted down while talking to
villagers, or when overheard.
elicited material
The elicited material includes lists of words and short sentences recorded at the
beginning of the fieldwork as well as self-constructed sentences and contrasting pairs made
while working with informants.
28Both of these databases were developed by members of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL).","[28, 29, 30]"
"Sequences of verbs191coordinating: for instance, a sequence of verbs which was not coordinating to begin with
could be made into a coordinating construction by inserting mati. What makes this test
relevant for coordinating sequences is the semantic similarity of coordinating sequences
with and without mati: in other types of sequences, for instance ‘cognition verb + V’
sequences, it will appear that mati can effectuate a change in meaning.
8.1.3.2 Scope of interrogative
Foley and van Valin (1984:208) use, among other criteria, the scope of what they term
‘operators’ (categories of verb inflection, tense, mood etc.) over junctures in order to
determine the particular type of juncture. Negation as a test is often used in the literature
(for example Foley & Olson 1985:27), but I have omitted it here.4 The reason for this is
that despite the fact that the types of verb sequences are different, they all behave similarly
when negated.
In coordinating sequences of verbs, that is those where each verb constitutes a separate
clause, it is expected that each conjunct can independently take peripheral operators. That
is, the scope of these operators can be over just one conjunct (Foley & van Valin
1984:244). This is confirmed in examples (19)–(21) below. Each example is ambiguous:
the scope of the interrogative can be either over the entire construction (reading 1.) or over
the final verb (reading 2.). In each case, reading 1. is the preferred interpretation. Note that
the scope of the interrogator can never exclude the final conjunct in the series. So, in (21),
the interrogation can never have as its scope m-ko tafoh; saruk po-iit; or m-ko tafoh saruk
po-iit alone.5

the interrogative mood. Compare example (22) below with (19). In (22), a pause separates
the two conjuncts, and there is a drop in pitch at the end of each conjunct. Unlike (19), (22)
cannot be ambiguous, as the scope of the interrogator can only be over the last conjunct.","[208, 209]"

referent of the subject is unknown. This is especially the case for clauses including a verb
with a covert person prefix.
6.4 The object
Like subject NPs, object NPs can also be omitted without violating the grammaticality
of an utterance. This is illustrated in the pairs in (20)–(22) below, where in the a-varieties
the clause has a nominal object, and in the b-varieties this object is absent.

which contain a transitive verb is pragmatic: if the object is referred to earlier in the
discourse, and is hence known to the listener, then it can be omitted. In example (23), the
object of m-tah ‘They eat small meat’ is ru r-ana ‘their bird’. ‘Ø’ refers to an omitted
object.

Another example is given in the passage in (24)–(26). In (25) the implied object of
m-aut ‘They climb’ is ara wisam ‘“wisam” tree’, given in (24). In (26) the implied object
of m-ehoh is apan, occurring earlier in the same sentence.

‘After they found the snake the two stabbed (=killed) (it).’Omission of nominal arguments is also attested in other Papuan languages and,
according to Foley, characteristic of the fact that in Papuan languages morphology is more
important in the organisation of the grammar than syntax (Foley 1986:168–171). Although
Maybrat has little morphology, and word order is relevant in the organisation of the
grammar, the ‘dropping’ of nominal objects is allowed. As far as I know, any ‘transitive’
verb can also occur without its object, and still be acceptable.
6.5 Nominal clauses
Nominal clauses are clauses with a nominal head. In nominal clauses, the ‘subject’
usually refers to a known entity, while the nominal predicate gives additional information
about that entity. Semantically, nominal clauses can often be adequately translated as
equative clauses, that is clauses of the form ‘x is y’. Nominal clauses can be modified by
adverbials in the same way as verbal clauses. The structure of a verbless clause is:
(27){Time} Subj [NP] {Location/Manner/Aspect + Det}Some examples of nominal clauses appear below. In example (29) the subject contains
an RC, and in (30) the head of the clause is a possessive form.

4The species referred to by ara wisam was not found by the botanists in Ayawasi (see Avé 1998).
Kertia and tiaran were pronounced by an elderly man who has not received an education in Indonesian.
The pronunciation of these words is adapted (see §2.8).","[163, 164, 165]"

As opposed to lines 3 and 4, where terus ‘and then’ expresses a sequentiality in time, here terus marks an
ordering in the explanation.
12
Tiaran is a phonologically adapted form of jalan [»djalan] (see §2.8). See also this section for other
phonologically adapted forms indicated in this text.
13
The generic demonstrative form we-t-o is used to modify amah ‘house’ because the house no longer
existed at the time the story was told, and could therefore not be specified. Conversely, in the following
line, the specific form re-t-o is used to modify tuoh ‘place’, since the place still exists, and can be
specified.
14
This form is phonologically adapted from Ind. kumpul [»kumpul].
15
In this form, the plural stem of the verb -akuo ‘feast’ is prefixed with the nominaliser po to derive a noun
(see §4.3.4).",[265]
"9Complex constructionsComplex constructions are constructions that involve more than one clause with a
marker to indicate the relationship between these clauses. Because of the presence of a
marker, complex constructions are formally different from the constructions involving
sequences of verbs. A distinction can be made between two types of complex construction,
namely coordinating constructions and adverbial clauses. Coordinating constructions
contain two functionally equivalent members bound by means of a linking device (Dik
1997:189). Adverbial clauses are constructions which function as modifiers of clauses
(Thompson & Longacre 1985:172). Adverbial clauses are syntactically parallel to RCs in
that they are introduced by a marker, and that the restricting clause modifies the (clausal)
head.
I will begin with a discussion of coordinating complex constructions in §9.1, followed
by a discussion of adverbial clauses in §9.2. In §9.3, I will describe some functional
properties of p-awiya, which is formally an interrogative. It will appear that p-awiya can
function as a coordinator, and as a kind of copula-linker between an NP or a locative
adverbial and a clause. Finally, in §9.4, I will discuss some style figures that are commonly
used in Maybrat.
9.1 Coordination
In coordinated sentences, two clauses are linked by an interclausal coordinator. The
coordinator that links the two clauses is invariably found between the clauses that are
linked. Coordinated clauses are always separated by an intonation break. Within sentences,
such a break always directly precedes the coordinator. This break is manifested as a rise in
pitch on the final syllable of the preceding clause followed by a pause. An example follows
(mati is the coordinator):
(1)t-amo Soróng / mati
ø-tim àm /
1S-go Sorong
and.then ø-send letter
‘I am going to Sorong and then I will send a letter.’Linking usually occurs within one sentence, but may also occur across sentence
boundaries. When this is the case, the coordinator can be placed either in sentence-initial or
in sentence-final position. In sentence-initial position, the coordinator is preceded by
sentence-final intonation of the previous sentence, that is a fall in pitch followed by a
pause. This is illustrated in example (2), where m-nan is the coordinator. In other words,
222Complex constructions 223
the difference between linking within sentences and linking across sentence boundaries is
that in the former there is a rise in pitch, while in the latter there is a fall. If the coordinator
occurs in sentence-final position, the fall in pitch is on the coordinator, followed by a
pause, as in (3) (the coordinator here is na).

‘Once upon a time a man went and saw (it) like this. Then he followed the
nest, the pig with her children, their footsteps.’ (lit. ‘their feet’, but referring
to ‘footsteps’ in this context.)In §4.9, I presented a class of coordinators. In addition to these coordinators there are a
number of elements that formally belong to other word classes, but that can function as
coordinators. These are: m-nan ‘it is enough’, ‘it is finished’, (or ‘it is similar to’) (verb); o
‘ENUM’ (enumerator); and fe ‘NEG’ (adverb).
Because there are no syntactic criteria to subdivide different kinds of coordination, I
have decided to describe the coordinators in terms of meaning. Roughly, five semantic
groups can be distinguished, namely sequentiality (§9.1.1); enumeration (§9.1.2);
disjunction (§9.1.3); purpose (§9.1.4); and cause/reason (§9.1.5). In §9.3, I will treat the
form p-awiya, which is formally a question word (see §4.5), but can also function as a
coordinator and as an adverbial clause marker.
9.1.1 Sequentiality
The three coordinators that can express sequentiality are mati, na and m-nan. When they
occur between two clauses the ordering of the events is always iconic, that is the event that
occurs first in time is also the event that is first mentioned.
9.1.1.1 The coordinator mati
In examples (4a) and (5a) constructions with the coordinator mati are given. In (4a) mati
expounds the sequentiality which is implicitly present in the corresponding b-varieties.
Example (5a) is semantically an emphatic conditional construction: mati marks the
following clause as valid only if the action expressed in the first clause is fulfilled. This
emphasis is absent in the first clause.","[239, 240, 241]"

Sikos y-hu
au
near-U because man Sikos 3M-stay U.DIST
‘Look at where the boundary of the “wera” tree is because Sikos lives there.’The reason I have glossed -re in wo-re as ‘PART’ (particle) is that the function and
meaning of -re in this context are not clear. In so doing, however, I may be missing a
syntactic generalisation that can be made about -re ‘PART’. Syntactically, locative adverbial
clauses function as the object of a verb. They can be replaced by a noun, as illustrated
below:20
(75) a. m-hu
(wo-re
rae ø-skie spiah)obj
3U-stay location.GEN-PART man ø-build hut
‘They stay where the people built a hut.’
b. m-hu
(amah)obj
3U-stay house
‘They stay in the house.’
In the same way as demonstratives including the prefix re- are clearly associated with
nominal constituents, the morpheme -re in the adverbial clause marker wo-re may be
associated with nominal constituents. It is therefore possible that the morpheme -re in
wo-re is related to the demonstrative prefix re- ‘location.SPEC’.
9.2.3 Manner adverbials
Manner adverbial clauses are introduced by the bimorphemic marker fi-re ‘like’. The
morpheme fi- is clearly isomorphous to the demonstrative prefix fi- ‘similar to’ given their
formal and semantic identity. Again, the morpheme -re in fi-re is glossed as ‘PART’, but
like -re in wo-re, it may be related to the demonstrative prefix re-. Some examples with
fi-re:
(76)n-fot

in clause-final position. An example is:
20Replacement of the adverbial clause by a noun is also possible when the adverbial clause marker is wo,
for instance, in (74).","[255, 256]"

‘Ayawasi that he sends a letter to is nice.’However, in example (152), extraction of the object of the third verb, tapam ‘land’ was
always considered acceptable, see for example (152c). Apparently tapam ‘land’ can be
understood as the topic of the RC. It is difficult to find a semantic motivation for the
unacceptability of (150b), and for the acceptability of (152c). It seems that in sequences
with three verbs, it cannot be completely predicted whether the object of a verb can or
cannot be extracted.

‘The ground on which he fells the sago tree and it breaks and crashes is
very muddy.’In sequences of two verbs, of which one is a motion verb, a position verb, or a shared
argument construction verb, the first object can be extracted. Likewise, in ‘valencyincreasing’ constructions, the argument that functions as the object of the first verb and the
subject of the second verb can be extracted. Apparently, all these verbs, when combined220Chapter 8with other verbs, yield constructions from which objects can be extracted without giving
rise to ‘logical conflicts’ and hence unacceptability.
In other words, these constructions seem similar to two types of construction discussed
before: they are similar to coordinating constructions from the point of view of intonation,
and morphology, and they behave largely the same when placed in the interrogative mood.
However, these forms violate the CSC. This makes them similar to the constructions
involving an object complement, which also ‘violate’ the CSC. Indeed, in many of the
problematic constructions the second clause can be analysed as an object complement of
the first clause, as illustrated below (see also the examples in §8.3):
(153) a.b.(154) a.b.ø-hren [[t-kom
am]]
ø-sit
1S-write letter
‘I sit and write a letter.’
ø-hren [[tapam]]

m-amo [[m-ate
aya]]
3U-go 3U-go.under water
‘She goes and bathes.’
m-amo [[aya]]
3U-go water
‘She goes to the river.’However, in §8.3 I illustrated that in constructions involving an object complement, a
pause between the two verbs can bring about a significant change in meaning. This is not
the case for these ‘problematic’ verb sequences. Thus, according to the criteria set in this
chapter, they keep a middle way between coordinating constructions and constructions
involving an object complement.
A case could be made for the presence of serial verb constructions in Maybrat. In what
are claimed to be serialising languages, the motion verbs ‘come’ and ‘go’ and the position
verbs ‘stand’ and ‘stay’ are commonly found in serial verb constructions (Foley & Olson
1985:41–42). The same is true for a verb like -o, which expresses a semantic function
similar to ‘instrumental’ (Sebba 1987:162). Likewise, ‘shared argument’ constructions,
such as ‘X kills Y dies’, as in example (145) above, are common in serialising languages
(Sebba 1987:197). Hamel (1993) refers to this type of construction as ‘causative/result’
where the main verb is the cause, and the serial verb is the result. And lastly, serialising
languages often use ‘valency-increasing’ constructions to make it possible to add an extra
argument to an expression (Foley & Olson 1985:48; Sebba 1987:216; Zwicky 1990:3).
The question is if the constructions discussed in this section really qualify as ‘serial’.
The term ‘serial verb construction’ itself has been the subject of much debate in recent
linguistic literature. Zwicky (1990:2) states that the term ‘serial’ is often used to refer to
juxtaposed verbs in general, without stating explicitly the relationship between these verbs.
Thus, if taken loosely, all the sequences of verbs in this chapter qualify as serial. However,
in the literature the term ‘serial’ is usually applied to a specific type of verb series. Some
formal criteria that apply to ‘serial verb constructions’ are as follows:Sequences of verbs
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)221They have only one overtly expressed (syntactic) subject (Sebba 1987:86).
There must be no ascertainable clause boundary between the two verbs
(Sebba 1987:39).
There cannot be any overt conjunctions between the verbs (Zwicky 1990:4;
Foley & Olson 1985:18; Sebba 1987:39).
All the verbs have the same aspect, tense and mood (Zwicky 1990:4; Foley &
Olson 1985:28; Sebba 1987:39).
Verbs in a serial verb construction must also be able to occur as single
predicates.
The serial verbs refer to one single event (Comrie 1995:26).","[237, 238, 239]"
"The clause1516.8 Adverbials
The function of adverbials in the clause is to modify or specify an event expressed by
the predicate (see §4.7). Adverbials occur in the ‘periphery’ of the clause. In Maybrat
peripheral constituents can be syntactically defined as ‘any constituent which is not a head
or a subject or object argument’. Peripheral constituents are constituents that specify the
spatial or temporal setting of an event (cf. Foley & Olson 1985:36).
In the discussion of the periphery, I will make a distinction between different types of
adverbials, based on syntactic and semantic criteria. The section will begin with the
periphery that precedes the predicate in a clause, that is the temporal periphery (§6.8.1).
Subsequently, the peripheries that occur in clause-final position are described, namely the
manner (§6.8.2), aspect (§6.8.3), and focus (§6.8.4) periphery. Apart from the adverbs
introduced in §4.7, these peripheries can also include items that formally belong to other
word classes, but can function as adverbials. In §6.8.6 I will discuss the location periphery.
Negation is described in §6.9. Clausal determiners and anaphoric reference are treated in
§6.10 and §6.11 respectively.
6.8.1 Time
In the temporal periphery, the question of ‘when’ the action described in the clause took
place or will take place is answered. The temporal periphery precedes s-V in a clause, as
illustrated in example (43). If the subject of a clause is also expressed by a full NP, then the
temporal adverbial may either precede this subject, or follow it, as illustrated in (44). The
difference in meaning between these two forms is, according to informants, negligible. The
scope of the temporal adverbial is the entire clause that follows.
(43)is
y-pat
Konya y-ama

‘Yesterday he came from Konya.’(44) a.pi

‘The man hid there just now.’b.ira
pi
ait y-apum au
just.now man 3M 3M-hide U.DIST
‘Just now the man hid there.’Temporal adverbs can be combined, in order to make time reference more specific. The
mutual ordering of the two time adverbs does not seem to be crucial, given the examples in
(47) and (48): in (47) the temporal adverbial is tian pose, while in (48) it is pose tian.

clause. In addition, there are a number of numerals and demonstratives which can function
as temporal adverbials.
Many languages have temporal deictic forms which are derived from, or based on,
spatial demonstratives (Anderson & Keenan 1985:297–300; Heine et al. 1991:31). In
Maybrat the demonstrative me-f-o can function as a temporal adverbial.10 Some examples
are:
(49)me-f-ot-ait
po-iit
PRESTT-very.near-U 1S-eat NOM-eat.P
‘Now I’m eating food.’(50)Mafif y-awe, me-f-o

ø-farkor m-ae Jayapura
Agus PRESTT-very.near-U ø-study 3U-at Jayapura
‘Agus is studying at Jayapura now.’Likewise, the directional tis ‘behind’ and the complex directional to-tis ‘LOC-behind’
can occur in the temporal periphery of a clause. In this function, tis is adequately translated
as ‘finally’, and to-tis as ‘in the end’. Both notionally refer to time:
(52)m-nan
tis
m-nies
ro y-api t-a
ø-sruer

‘After this, finally, he smells the big one which lies scattered (on the ground).’(53)to-tis
ait y-no po
m-of
LOC-behind 3m 3m-do thing 3u-good
‘In the end he does well.’ (lit. ‘In the end he does good things.’)Below, an example of a nominal clause modified by to-tis is given:
(54)10to-tis
y-ana
s-ait
ku
sme
LOC-behind 3M-head one-3M child male
‘The last one is a boy.’I noted one instance of the demonstrative we-f-o functioning as a temporal adverbial:

apan potafit
sawiah m-apuf
location.GEN-very.near-U 1P 1P-see {snake potafit} ø-tail 3U-short
‘Now we see that the potafit snake has a short tail.’The clause153Some NPs that notionally refer to time, such as snie ‘month’ or tein ‘year’ can function
as temporal adverbials. These NPs can be modified by a numeral (55)–(57), and, if the
head is snie ‘month’, by the name of the month (58):
(55)snie

Fince m-ape

‘In three months Fince will give birth.’(56)tein s-au

‘In two months it will rain again.’(58)snie
Maret ana ø-skie amah m-arak
month March 3P ø-build house 3U-empty
‘In March they will finish building the house.’The expression um sau, as in (59), is an idiomatic expression, used to introduce a new
story. It is adequately translated as ‘once upon a time’.
(59)um

‘Once upon a time the two stand and burn a garden.’(60)um
s-au
arin
mti oh …
moment one-3U situation night already
‘Once upon a time, it is already night …’As already illustrated in §4.7.1, numerals can also be used as time adverbials. In
practice, only the numerals from ‘three’ to ‘six’ are used in this function. To refer to a time
span larger than six days, the Indonesian term Hari Minggu ‘Sunday’ is used. ‘Sundays’
can be modified by a numeral to refer to the number of weeks. Some examples are:
(61)Hari Minggu s-au
amu p-mo ø-twok sembahyang’
{Sunday}
one-3U 1P 1P-go.P ø-enter pray
‘On one (a particular) Sunday, we go and enter and pray.’(62)Hari Minggu tuf t-amo Negeri Belanda
u
{Sunday}
three 1S-go {The Netherlands} again
‘After three Sundays I will go to The Netherlands again.’In example (63) the nominal clause waro fi-f-o ‘a little while, like this’, places the
action described in the clause in time. In other words, waro fi-f-o functions like a temporal
adverbial.

In the manner periphery, questions about ‘the way in which’ or ‘how’ an event takes
place are answered. Manner adverbials occur in clause-final position, and their scope is the
entire clause they modify. Some examples follow:

‘Go carefully.’In the examples above, the manner periphery is filled by manner adverbs, introduced in
§4.7.2. The occurrence of manner adverbs is restricted to the manner periphery of a clause.
The manner periphery can also be filled by forms that function as manner adverbials,
but formally belong to other word classes. The reason for analysing these forms as manner
adverbials is twofold: firstly, like the other manner adverbs, they occur in clause-final
position, thus taking the same syntactic position as manner adverbs. Secondly, they
stipulate how the action referred to in the clause is carried out, in other words, they have
the same semantic content as manner adverbials. A distinction can be made between two
types of ‘functional manner adverbials’, namely non-verbal forms and verbal forms. The
non-verbal forms are listed in (68). With the exception of rere, all are morphologically
complex.

as a manner adverbial meaning ‘carefully’, as in (70) and (71):

"Word classes99suffixes, -ait is isomorphous with the free form of the third person masculine pronoun ait
‘he’. These suffixes are used in the same way as person prefixes, namely according to
natural gender. This gender distinction is only relevant for the choice of suffix if the
demonstrative functions as a modifier to a noun and refers to a specific item (that is in
combination with the demonstrative prefix re-), and in the ‘presentative’ and with a fi‘similar.to’ prefix, but only if the demonstrative base is -t-. In all other cases the suffix -o is
used. Some examples in which masculine and unmarked forms are contrasted:

‘that woman’On the vertical axis in Table 1 (example 204) I have indicated the demonstrative
prefixes. Phonologically, these prefixes (with the exception of the fi- and ti- -forms)
normally have the form /Ce/, unless the demonstrative base is -n-: then the form of the
prefix is /Co/. Three exceptions are pe-n-o, m-n-o, and the masculine form re-n-e.
In the demonstrative forms a distinction can be made between demonstratives that
function attributively, namely those carrying a prefix re-, we-, te- or ti-, and demonstratives
that function adverbially, namely those with a prefix pe-, me- or fi-. A contrast between
two demonstrative forms that both refer to area, te- and pe-, is given in (208) and (209): in
the forms with te- the demonstrative functions attributively and in the forms with pe- it
functions adverbially:

be used attributively:
(210)*amah pe-f-o
house area.ADV-very.near-UIn the remainder of this section, I will first describe the attributive demonstrative forms,
followed by the adverbial demonstrative forms.
4.4.1 Demonstratives that function attributively
Demonstratives that function attributively are defined as those forms that typically
occupy the last position in an NP and that modify the head noun in an NP. In the forms
given in (200)–(203) and (205)–(207) above, the demonstrative forms are used
attributively. The demonstrative prefix re- is used because the head noun is specific, that is
it can be pinpointed. In these forms, the prefix may be omitted without significantly
changing the meaning of the utterance:
(211)po-kom
(re-)f-o
NOM-write (location.SPEC-)very.near-U
‘this pen very near’(212)po-kom
(re-)t-o
NOM-write (location.SPEC-)near-U
‘this pen near’(213)(ro-)n-o
(location.SPEC-)far-U
‘that pen far away’po-komNOM-write(214)po-kom
(re-)au
NOM-write (location.SPEC-)U.DIST
‘that pen (unspecified for distance)’In the attributive demonstrative pronouns, a contrast in specificity can be made: as
opposed to re-, the prefix we- is used if the referent of the head noun is non-specific, that is
it cannot be pinpointed. Compare, for example, (215a) and (216a) with their respective bforms — repeated from (200) and (201). Example (215a) is used when a pen is within
reach, but its exact position is not known, that is it is not clear whether the pen is in front of
the speaker, behind the speaker and so on.43 In Ayawasi, re- can refer to both singular and
plural. Conversely, (215b) is used when the exact position of the pen is known.
43In some dialects, notably those spoken to the south of Ayawasi, we- is used for plural as opposed to re-,
which is used for singular.

"204Chapter 8As mentioned before, these constructions are formally the same as indirect speech
constructions: both -awe and the following verb receive a person prefix, which is apparent
from all the examples so far in this section, and the entire utterance is dominated by one
intonation contour (83):
(83)t-awe y-amo y-aut
tuò
/
1S-say 3M-go 3M-climb palm.wine.tree
‘I think he goes and climbs into the palm-wine tree.’Moreover, in the interrogative mood, the scope of the interrogator is always the entire
utterance (84) and (85):

‘Do you think he’s done something wrong which is why people are angry
with him?’Thus, indirect speech and pseudo-quotative constructions are formally the same, but
differ in semantic content.
8.4 Prepositional notions
In §4.2.3.5, I introduced four prepositional verbs, listed again below:
(86)-ae
-kit
-pat
-kah‘at’
‘towards’
‘from’
‘with’/‘to’/‘for’I illustrated that only -ae ‘at’ can function as a main verb and that it may have a
defective paradigm; and that -kah invariably has a defective paradigm, and that these verbs
invariably occur with an object. I concluded that these verbs are less ‘verby’ than verbs
that can function as main verbs.
In sequences of verbs, prepositional verbs are never the first verb in the sequence. Verb
sequences that involve these verbs are different from any of the other sequences discussed
so far. To begin with, all sequences allow a pause preceding the prepositional verb, but
rather than changing the meaning of the utterance, this merely shifts the emphasis of the
utterance to the prepositional verb and its object. For example, in (87b), the fact that people
go towards the sago tree (and not somewhere else) is emphasised. There is a rise in pitch
directly preceding the pause, but when the second verb is -ae, a fall in pitch is allowed, as
in (90c). This is because the verb -ae can function as a single-verb clause.

‘I went, and (now) I’m at the house.’With the exception of sequences involving -ae, none of the sequences with prepositional
verbs allow insertion of the coordinator mati. If mati is inserted between -ae and a
preceding verb, this incurs a considerable change in meaning, as illustrated in (91b). In this
example, y-ae functions as a main verb. This shows that -ae still has many verbal
properties.

‘He arrived and then he was at the foot of the sago tree.’The examples above illustrate clearly that the sequences involving -ae behave like
coordinating constructions, while sequences with other prepositional verbs do not.
Taking the objects out of coordinating constructions, adverbial constructions and
constructions involving an object complement seems straightforward, being either possible
or impossible according to informants. However, taking the objects out of sequences
involving a prepositional verb is less straightforward: the objects of -kit, as in example
(92b), and -pat, as in example (93b), can be extracted without any problem:206Chapter 8(92) a.b.(93) a.b.rae

in example (94a). A similar type of construction with -kit is not possible.
(94)ait y-pat
rapuoh y-ama
3M 3M-from forest 3M-come
‘He comes from the forest.’The behaviour (94) differs from constructions where the prepositional verb is preceded
by the motion verb. The differences are as follows: first, the entire utterance must be
dominated by one intonation contour. The presence of two intonation contours renders the
utterance ungrammatical, as shown in (95).
(95)*ait y-pat
rapuóh / y-àma
3M 3M-from forest
3M-comeThe second, most notable, difference with constructions where -pat precedes the motion
verb is in its behaviour under relativisation. Whereas relativisation on the object of -kit, as
in (92b) results in a grammatical construction, relativisation on the object of -pat results in
an anomalous construction, for example (96). I construed it myself, and some speakers
accepted it, but others quite resolutely rejected this sentence as unacceptable. In
spontaneous speech, this kind of construction is unattested.

the same manner is not allowed, as illustrated below:
(97)*pam ro t-fat
ara m-kah m-api
axe REL 1S-fell tree 3U-with 3U-bigHowever, there is a way to relativise on the object of -kah. If in the relativised sentence
the order of the verbs is reversed so that the first verb is m-kah, and what was originally the
first verb follows m-kah, the resulting utterance is grammatical. This is illustrated in
examples (98)–(99), where -kah semantically expresses an instrumental, and in (100),
where it expresses a recipient/benefactive:Sequences of verbs

"Introduction5Bird’s Head. The language described in the present study is a family-level isolate within
the West Papuan Phylum (WPP).8 This phylum also includes some North Halmahera
languages (Voorhoeve 1987a:717).9
Some characteristics shared by all the WPP10 languages of the Bird’s Head are their
SVO word order, as opposed to the SOV order of those of the TNGP languages. All WPP
languages have prefixes that are coreferent with the subject (for verbs), or with the
possessor (of inalienably possessed nouns). In most languages there is a gender distinction,
and an opposition between inclusive and exclusive forms in the first person plural (Reesink
1996:2–3).11 There seem to be some similarities in the pronominal prefix systems across
WPP languages, suggesting a genetic relation (Cowan 1953:24–26; Reesink 1996:4). All
known languages display sequences of verbs under one clausal intonation contour (Reesink
1996:6), and the word order in NPs is generally: Noun-Adjective-(Classifier)-NumeralDeterminer (Reesink 1996:8). Nominal compounds generally have the order ‘N1+ N2’,
where the whole noun is ‘a kind of N2’ (Reesink 1996:13).
Recent research,12 however, has indicated that viewing the WPP as a group of
genetically related languages is difficult to maintain: in a comparative study Reesink has
hypothesised no less than seven unrelated language groups (Reesink 1996:18). A striking
feature of these languages is the low number of shared lexical items found between the
groups, contrasting with typological similarities. This has led to the hypothesis that
thousands of years ago, possibly even before the arrival of the Austronesians on the
peninsula,13 a number of unrelated languages were spoken in the Bird’s Head peninsula.
Through trade a kind of ‘Sprachbund’ emerged, in which morphosyntactic features were
shared, but vocabularies were not (Reesink 1996:x). So, instead of finding new evidence
for the interrelatedness of the languages of the WPP, recent research has only created an
even more confusing linguistic map of the Bird’s Head area.
1.5 Previous research in Maybrat
Before 1993, some research had been done in the Maybrat area. The first linguistic
notes were made by J.-E. Elmberg, who worked in the Ayamaru area between 1953 and
1957. The Popot feast cycle (1966) includes sixteen pages of transcriptions of texts in the
dialect of Ayamaru (below referred to as Maymaru). These transcriptions give an idea of
the language, but the English translations are free, that is there are no interlinear glosses,
and there is no morphological breakdown. No orthographic conventions are given, so only
very superficial phonetic information can be gathered from these texts. The work also
8A family-level isolate is a language which, on its own, comprises one Family of a Stock (Wurm &
McElhanon 1975:152).
9
Foley (1986) does not discuss the WPP at all, as hardly any information on this Phylum was available.
10
However, most WPP languages on Halmahera do have SOV word order (Voorhoeve 1988:192–193; van
Staden pers. comm.).
11
Both the SVO word order and the inclusive/exclusive distinction are typically Austronesian
characteristics. With respect to the opposition between inclusive and exclusive which is not grammatically
expressed, Maybrat is an exception in the Bird’s Head. The absence of this opposition was also pointed
out by Cowan (1953:21). For more information on first person plural forms in Maybrat (see §4.1.1).
12
Within ISIR, work has been done on the languages Moi (Menick 1995, 1996); Hatam (Reesink 1999);
Inanwatan (de Vries 1996); Mpùr (Odé 1995:1996).
13
According to radiocarbon dating of archaeological remains, the Austronesian population started to
disperse into Western Oceania around 3300 BP (Bellwood et al. 1998:233).","[22, 23]"
"Sequences of verbs189Note that the examples above were found in speech utterances at a normal speed. In
allegro speech, a coordinating construction may be dominated by just one intonation
contour, as in (10) and (11). In (10), buka mtah m-asoh re-f-o constitutes one clause, as
does m-mat. There is no intonation break between these two clauses, nor is there a fall in
pitch. Example (11) was taken from a story told by an elderly man who was present at an
incident between a villager (i) and an enemy (j). The storyteller became very excited when
he was telling this, as a result of which he spoke very quickly. Consequently, there were no
pauses between the verbs, and the entire utterance was dominated by just one intonation
contour.

‘Hei provoked this onej very near and hej fled and collided with the tree.’It must be borne in mind that in coordinating sequences such as the ones in examples
(10) and (11), it is never ungrammatical to create a single intonation contour over the
whole construction, although a separate contour over each verb is equally grammatical.
This is illustrated in (12), which was elicited, based on (11). There is no marked difference
in meaning between these two utterances, apart from the fact that in (12) each event is
perceived as having more emphasis than in (11), indicated by the commas in the
translation. However, this does not change the syntactic structure of the utterance.

‘Hei provoked this onej very near, and hej fled, and collided with the tree.’When enumerating a series of events rather than merely describing them, the pitch
preceding the pause can rise.2 This rise in pitch is indicated by an acute accent in the
example below — derived from (7). Sentence-finally, there still is a fall in pitch. The
‘enumerating’ character in (13) is indicated by commas in the translation. Even though
here the pitch rises rather than falls, (13) does constitute a coordinating sequence of verbs,
as will be demonstrated with the help of other criteria below. Thus, intonation, and more
specifically pitch, is not the only criterion by which one verb sequence can be
distinguished from another.

In coordinating sequences of verbs, all the verbs take an overt or covert person prefix,
as illustrated in examples (14)–(16) below. This criterion is somewhat limited because of
the morphophonological constraint on overt person prefixes, as illustrated in (16).
2A rise in pitch in this position is, however, uncommon. Only a few instances occur in, for example,
Appendix I, in which intonational characteristics are given.","[206, 207]"

Morphologically, verbs can be defined as those words that take obligatory person
prefixes. Under certain circumstances this prefix is not phonologically realised due to
morphophonological constraints. These constraints, as well as paradigms of declined verbs,
have already been discussed in §3.1. In this section, we also illustrated that verbs and
inalienably possessed nouns are morphologically identical. Some paradigms representative
of all the different morphophonological paradigms of verbs are given in (35) for the sake

to use a syntactic criterion to distinguish these two categories: syntactically, verbs are
words that can function as a minimal predicate. The person prefix is coreferent with the
subject of the clause. In (36) this subject is not expressed as an NP, while in (37) it is (see
§6.3 for a discussion on subject NPs in clauses).

morphophonological ones, namely -akus ‘left.behind’, -rof ‘follow’ and -roh ‘descend’. In
constructions in which these prefixless verbs feature, they are invariably directly preceded
by an overtly or covertly inflected verb. An example of -akus functioning as an
(intransitive) main verb is given in (38a), which consists of two clauses separated by a
comma. Example (39b) includes the same verb, but without a person prefix:

biskui, tuo t-akus
man 3U-give biscuit 1S 1S-leave.behind
‘The people give biscuits, I’m left out.’ (i.e. I don’t get any)
t-se
akus
sasu
1S-place left.behind sweet.potato
‘I place the sweet potato and leave it behind temporarily.’In constructions like (38b), the bare-stem verb functions as an adverbial, that is it
modifies or specifies the preceding verb. These constructions are described in detail in
§8.2.
In compound nouns of the type N+V, where V is an ‘adjectival verb’, a person prefix
may also be omitted (see §4.3.5).
4.2.1 Classes of verbs
In §3.1, I distinguished between a number of morphological classes of verbs. In this
section I will make a subdivision according to syntactic criteria. A straightforward
distinction between the classes of verbs is made according to transitivity: intransitive verbs
can only receive one argument, whereas transitive verbs can take two arguments. However,
transitivity is not the only criterion for the classification of verbs, as a more subtle
grouping can be made. For example, in the class of intransitive verbs a class of ‘adjectival’
verbs, which can function attributively in an NP, can be identified. Likewise, in the class of
transitive verbs, the ability of verbs to take certain types of objects has syntactic
consequences for their behaviour in sequences of verbs.
Intransitive verbs are discussed in §4.2.2, followed by a discussion of transitive verbs in
§4.2.3. Within these sections, the various subclasses are introduced. I will give examples of
each type of verb in a clause, and refer to the relevant sections in Chapter 6 (on the clause)
and Chapter 8 (on sequences of verbs) for more detailed syntactic motivations according to
which these subclasses can be defined.
4.2.2 Intransitive verbs
The only argument that an intransitive verb can take is a subject. There are three classes
of intransitive verbs, namely regular intransitive verbs, adjectival verbs, and quantifying
verbs. Each class is discussed in turn below.
4.2.2.1 Regular intransitive verbs
The class of regular intransitive verbs includes verbs that can only function
predicatively. This is illustrated in (50) below. Examples of typically intransitive verbs are:70Chapter 4(39)-awe
-haf
-hai
kron
ksie
-tie‘fall’
‘pregnant’
‘die’
‘sound’
‘sneeze’
‘break (sticks)’Some of these intransitive verbs can be made transitive by attaching the derivative
prefix -i- TRANS (see §4.2.4).
Some clauses featuring intransitive verbs are:
(40)rae y-atiet
man 3M-perish
‘The man perishes.’(41)smai tapam m-o
{bean land}9 3U-grow
‘The peanuts grow.’An apparent exception in the series of intransitive verbs is the expression -hai awiah ‘to
be hungry’, given in (42).10 The form -hai awiah here suggests that an intransitive verb
receives a nominal object. However, this object is not a regular nominal object, as it cannot
be extracted through relativisation, as illustrated in (43).11 This suggests that the expression
-hai awiah is an idiomatic term which functions as one single syntactic unity.
(42)y-hai awiah
3M-die taro
‘He is hungry.’(43)*awiah ro y-hai m-api
REL 3M-die 3U-big
taro4.2.2.2 Adjectival verbs
Adjectival verbs are verbs that can function predicatively in a clause, as well as
attributively in an NP. Semantically, they express typically ‘adjectival’ notions, such as
dimension (‘big’, ‘small’, ‘thick’ etc.), physical property (‘hard’, ‘soft’, ‘heavy’, ‘light’
etc.), colour (‘black’, ‘white’, ‘red’ etc.), value (‘good’, ‘bad’ etc.) (Dixon 1977:31). It is
not unusual for a language to show a convergence between verbal and adjectival notions,
so that both are expressed in one word class, usually that of ‘verb’ (Dixon 1977). Some
examples of adjectival verbs, given in antonym pairs are:9Smai tapam is a compound noun: compound nouns are separated by a single space in the text, and
enclosed between braces in the glosses (see §4.3.5).
10
This expression is the only term attested to express hunger, i.e. it does not apply just to a desire to eat
awiah ‘taro’.

"88Chapter 4between 1972–74, that is twenty-five years before I collected data in Ayawasi. Although
informants were able to translate it, they identified it as a form that is no longer used.
(150)ait y-ato
3M 3M-hole
‘He is riddled (with bullets).’ (lit. ‘He is holed.’)Other forms with putative person prefixes other than m- appeared unacceptable upon
elicitation, for example *t-asuf, *t-apuo.23
Examples of possessive constructions involving spatial nouns are:
(151)amah m-aom
house 3U-outside
‘outside the house’ (lit. ‘the outside of the house’)(152)aya
m-asuf
water 3U-middle
‘the middle of the water’ (lit. ‘the water’s middle’)(153)ara m-ato
tree 3U-hole
‘inside the tree’ (lit. ‘the tree’s inside’)The uniformity in the first consonant ‘m’ in the spatial nouns can hardly be attributed to
sheer coincidence: it suggests that the spatial nouns are fossilised forms of inalienably
possessed nouns that used to take person prefixes other than m-. Given the uniformity in
form among the spatial nouns, the (archaic) form in (150), and the similarity in behaviour
of all these nouns in possessive constructions, I conclude that spatial nouns are a subclass
of inalienably possessed nouns.
Although the spatial nouns are classified as a subclass of the nouns, their nominal
character can arguably be questioned: as opposed to regular nouns, spatial nouns lack some
typically nominal features. For example, m-ato is the only spatial noun that can function as
the subject of a clause, as in (154), or as the head of an NP (155).
(154)m-ato
m-ae ara
3U-hole 3U-at tree
‘There’s a hole in the wood.’(155)m-ato m-api re-t-o
3U-hole 3U-big location.SPEC-near-U
‘this big hole’23The form suf ‘middle’ is used by members of the Air family, who have their origins in the area to the
north of Ayawasi. Suf is semantically similar to m-asuf ‘middle’, the form used in Ayawasi. Formally,
the ‘northern’ form lacks a putative person prefix m-, and a vowel a. An example is iso suf ‘the middle
of the path’ which is a possessive construction of the type possessor-possessed:
y-amo ø-frok
iso suf
3M-go ø-emerge path middle
‘He emerges at the middle of the path.’Word classes89Another form which may be a spatial noun is mpair ‘place’. Although this form is
unattested in possessive constructions of the type ‘possessor-possessed’, it is formally
similar to the other spatial nouns in that it is m-initial.24 It can occur as the head of an NP:
(156)mpair m-of
place 3U-good
‘The place is good.’While spatial nouns are in some ways formally and syntactically similar to other
inalienably possessed nouns, they also lack some properties that are typically associated
with nouns.
4.3.2 Alienably possessed nouns
Alienably possessed nouns are those forms which cannot take person prefixes. In other
words, unlike the inalienably possessed nouns, the possessor of an alienably possessed
noun is not marked on the noun.
In possessive constructions where the alienably possessed noun is the possessed, the
order of the constituents is possessed-possessor, where the possessor is preceded by the
possessive marker ro. Some examples:
(157)amah ro-Petrus
house POSS-Petrus
‘Petrus’ house’(158)amah ro-t-atia
house POSS-1S-father
‘my father’s house’(159)po-ø-satoh
r-au
NOM-ø-collect POSS-3U
‘her possessions’(160)fane ro-Yan
pig POSS-Yan
‘Yan’s pig’See §5.2 for a more detailed treatment of possessive constructions.
4.3.3 Gender and number in nouns
Maybrat nouns have natural gender: nouns referring to male human or, in some cases,
male animate, are masculine. The other nouns are unmarked. This gender distinction is
only expressed in inalienably possessed nouns in the third person singular. Some examples
of masculine and unmarked subjects appear below, where the subject of the clause is
formally a kinship term as in (161) and (162), a body-part term as in (163) and (164) and
an alienably possessed noun (165) and (166).","[105, 106, 107]"

3M ø-hope
3M-say later 3M-catch catfish
‘He hopes (saying) that later he will catch catfish.’There are a number of characteristics relevant to this type of sequence. First, both verbs
must have coreferent person prefixes, as in examples (72)–(74). Secondly, the verb of
speaking and the following -awe are obligatorily dominated by the same intonation
contour, as indicated in (72)–(75). Thirdly, the coordinator mati never occurs between
these verbs. Finally, there is no way in which either the verb of speaking or -awe can be
interrogated independently. For instance (76) cannot mean *‘The sister asks, but does she
say that the bishop will come?’
(76)suster ø-tumuk m-awe Uskup y-ama
a
sister ø-ask
3U-say Bishop 3M-come INT
‘The sister asks, “Will the Bishop come?”’This behaviour suggests that sequences of the type ‘verb of saying + -awe’ are not
coordinating, since they are intonationally and syntactically inseparable. I showed that
semantically, the verb of saying in these constructions modifies -awe. The syntactic and
semantic behaviour of ‘“verb of saying” + -awe’ is, in fact, highly similar to the
constructions involving the adverbial verbs discussed in §8.2. Also, both constructions are
endocentric, since at least one of the elements can be substituted for the whole (Matthews
1981:147). However, there is also a difference. While adverbial constructions are
attributive endocentric constructions, since only the verb taking the person prefix canSequences of verbs203function as a main verb, ‘verb of saying + -awe’ is completely endocentric: either ‘verb of
saying’ or -awe can also function as a main verb in a clause, as was illustrated in example
(71).
8.3.2 Pseudo-quotatives
Quotative constructions include direct and indirect speech forms. Such forms reflect
what was or is actually said by someone. This category contrasts semantically with
‘pseudo-quotatives’, which reflect the thought content of the speaker.
Like quotatives, pseudo-quotatives include the verb -awe ‘say’. Phonologically,
morphologically and syntactically these constructions are identical to indirect speech
forms, and they can therefore not be formally contrasted with quotatives. The use of a verb
equivalent to ‘say’ in this capacity is common in Papuan languages, and has been
discussed by, among others, Reesink (1987, 1993) and de Vries (1990, 1993). In this
section, I will give some examples of pseudo-quotative constructions and their different
functions.
When -awe is preceded by a ‘mental activity verb’ such as -oa ‘not know’ or winaut
‘hope’, the verb sequence emphasises the mental activity expressed by this mental activity
verb. Some examples:
(77)tuo t-oa
t-awe snie
re-f-o
1S 1S-not.know 1S-say month location.SPEC-very.near-U
snie
September oh
month September already
‘I didn’t realise this month is already September.’(78)ait ø-winaut y-awe ait orie y-kat
fiam
3M ø-hope
3M-say 3M later 3M-catch catfish
‘He hopes that later he will catch a catfish.’The verb -awe also allows a number of different interpretations, such as desire (79) and
(80); belief/assumption (81); and intention (82):
(79)akut10
y-awe y-kias fi-t-o

r-ana
3U-say 3U-do EMPH-3P NOM-feast.P POSS-3P
‘They intend to make their feast themselves.’10t-o
near-UThis form is a kinship term. It normally takes a person prefix, e.g. t-akut ‘my (of a woman) son’; n-akut
‘your (of a woman) son’ etc. In is unclear why the person prefix was omitted in this form.
11
This example is taken from a fairy tale.","[219, 220, 221]"
"Word classes97The actual physical distances that these forms refer to are as follows: -f- ‘very near’
refers to something which is very near to the speaker, that is something he can actually
touch. Objects that are a little further away, but still within reach, are referred to with the
base -t- ‘near’. The form -n- ‘far’ is used to indicate objects that are far away from the
speaker. The distances referred to by -t- and -n- are relative: if two objects are both far
away, -n- applies to the object that is farthest away, and -t- to the one nearer. The form -fhowever, only applies to objects that are within physical reach of the speaker.
A fourth form, -au is unmarked for distance: it is used when the actual distance away
from the speaker is irrelevant. The form -au can be adequately translated as ‘there’. The
demonstrative form au is homophonous to the third person singular pronoun au ‘she’.
Given that generally third person pronouns and demonstratives are often related to each
other (see Greenberg 1985:271), it is possible that the demonstrative -au and the free
pronoun au ‘she’ have a common origin. The same is true for the masculine suffix -ait and
the third person masculine free pronoun ait ‘he’, as in (206a). These two forms may be
related to each other.35
Some contrasts featuring forms which include the demonstrative bases are given in
(200)–(203). The prefix re- and suffix -o in these forms will be discussed later:

contrasted. I have, however, not been able to verify this contrast.","[114, 115]"
