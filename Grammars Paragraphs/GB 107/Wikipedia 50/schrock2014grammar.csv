"Just like thatǃFinally, Ik has both positive and negative independent polarity particles:
ee/éé ‘yes’ and ńtóodó ‘no’. The particle ńtóodó seems to be morphologically
complex, though it cannot be fully parsed out. In any case, it seems to
incorporate the negator verb ńt-. In Ik, contrary to English, a negative reply
to a negative question can be preceded by ee/éé ‘yes’, and positive reply to a
negative question can be preceded by ńtóodó ‘no’. Consider the following:
(256)Negative question:Nta beɗidi?
ńt-ábɛ́ɗ-ɪ ́dɪINTERROG
̀not-REALwant-2SG [IRR]Don’t you want (it)?
(257)Possible answers:
Ee, nta beɗi.",[589]
"7.7.7 Negative
Negative polarity in Ik depends on the irrealis-realis distinction for
morphological manifestation. In other words, there is no independent
marking for polarity, in particular for negative polarity. Negation is
expressed in Ik with a combination of highly irregular negating verbs and
modal suffixes (irrealis or realis). This section presents only a brief
summary; see §10.13 for a more complete discussion of negation.
The following table introduces the Ik negating verbs, the modality of their
negated complements, the types of clauses they can negate:

Then the negated main verb follows in the irrealis mood (or realis mood, in
the case of prohibitives) as a kind of complement clause, for example:
(140)Nta ƙod.

"5579.16.4 Negative tags
Ik has two negative ‘tags’ that can be used following either positive or
negative statements. When they are used, the speaker normally expects a
corresponding positive reply. These tags and their replies are as follows:

"The‘anticipative’ verb ŋɔ́r- ‘do early’ is most likely related to the proto-Kalenjin
verb ŋɔɔr- ‘foretell’ (Rottland 1989). And the verb sár- is functionally quite
similar to the Turkana auxiliary -rok- which Dimmendaal calls the “auxiliary
of unexpected state of affairs” in the affirmative (1983:138) and the
“unexpected negative perfective” in the negative (1983:457).
(48)Ik auxiliary verbs
LexicalAspectualerúts-‘be new, fresh’Recentiveŋɔ́r-‘do early (already)’Anticipativesár-‘still, not yet, no longer’DurativeThe following three examples illustrate these auxiliary verbs. First, in (49)
the recentive auxiliary erúts- modifies the semantic main verb ats- ‘come’.
Since the auxiliary verb fills the syntactic slot for main verbs, the secondposition tense clitic =noo attaches to it:
(49)Erutsa noo ɲaɓura ats.
[erúts-á=noo]AUXɲaɓʊr-aSats-∅Vrecent-REAL=PST 3maize-NOM come-REALMaize (i.e. as a crop) came in the not-so-distant past.
In the next example, the anticipative auxiliary ŋɔ́r- modifies the main verb
cɛ- ‘kill’ which is transitive, taking A and O as arguments. The agent A is
omitted but is marked with a subject-agreement suffix on the auxiliary verb:486(50)Ŋorata naa cea riyek.
[ŋɔ́r-át-a=naa]AUXcɛ-aVrié-kᵃOearly-3PL-REAL=PST1kill-REALgoat-ACCThey already killed the goat (earlier today).
Transitive verbs like cɛ- ‘kill’ take an object in the accusative case only when
the subject is 3-person. In (50), though, it is the intransitive auxiliary verb
ŋɔ́r- that is marked for 3-person, not cɛ-. Still, the object of the clause takes
the accusative case. This is because the semantic main verb (V), not the
auxiliary (AUX), governs the argument structure of the clause.
This third example shows the affirmative durative Auxiliary sár- modifying
the intransitive verb kom- ‘be many’:
(51)Sarima koma zuk.
sár-ím-aAUXkom-aVstill-1PL.EXC-REALmany-REAL veryzukᵘWe are still very many.","[517, 518]"
"Semantically, these prohibitives are ‘irrealis’ in the sense that the
predication has not happened and is even forbidden from happening.
However, grammatically, the Ik prohibitive is marked as ‘realis’ with the
realis suffix {-a} (implying temporal actuality) on both the negating verb
and the complemental main verb. This kind of ‘polarity reversal’—where
negative imperatives occur with realis suffixes—is reportedly only rarely
attested in other languages around the world (Dixon 2012:112).",[587]
"5509.16 Negation
Negation in Ik is signaled by a combination of highly irregular, paradigmless negator verbs (235 below) and irrealis marking on the negated verb.
The negator verbs show agreement for an impersonal 3-person subject. One
of them, ńt-, always appears in the realis modality with a negated
complemental main verb in the irrealis modality. The other, ma-/na-, can
appear in either the realis or irrealis modalities (in the sequential aspect as
moo/noo). For past and present perfect tenses, its verbal complement is in
the irrealis modality, while for prohibitives (negative imperatives), the
complement is in the realis modality. Beyond these two negator verbs, two
lexical verbs, bɪrá- and bení-, are used to negate copula of location and
copula of identity verbs, respectively. The table in (235) presents the
negator verbs with the verb and clause types they can negate:
(235)Ik negator verbs
Verb typeClause typeńt-Non-past realisMainma-/na-a) Past realisMainb) Present perfectMainc) ImperativeMaind) IrrealisSubordinate(as mo-o/no-o)The negating morphemes presented in (235) are analyzed here as defective
verbs rather than merely negating particles for the following reasons:
1. They fill the clause-initial slot, which is reserved for the main verb.
2. They take modal suffixes (e.g. realis {-a} and sequential {-(k)ɔ}).
3. The negator ma-/na- can be modified by tense enclitics, which only
modify the clause predicate.
4. The irrealis (sequential) negator moo/noo can bear the dummy
pronominal enclitic {=ˊdɛ}, which otherwise attaches only to verbs.","[581, 582]"
"9.12.1 Polar questions
Polar questions generally expect a simple confirmation or denial as a
response. The response can be ‘yes’ (éé/ee) or ‘no’ (ńtóodó) or a repetition of
the question in the affirmative. Such questions in Ik are recognized by two
characteristics: 1) They end with the non-final allomorph of the last
morpheme in the question (as opposed to the final form in an Indicative
sentence), and 2) the last mora of the question takes a low boundary tone:
(166)Maraŋa?
maráŋ-à(167)Maraŋǃ
  maráŋ-∅ good-REALgood-REALIs it good?",[558]
"‘If she had gone (a while ago)…’515Conditional clauses may be negated through the use of the sequential
negating verb moo/noo following the conjunction naˊ=. And whereas
affirmative conditional clauses contain verbs in the sequential aspect,
negated conditional clauses contain the bare negative (irrealis) verb form:
(133)Naa noo ƙai, iryametima ŋitsanik.
[na=nó-óƙa-ⁱ]CONDiryám-ét-imaŋɪ ́tsanɪ ́-kᵋCONJ =not-SEQgo-3SG[IRR] get-VEN-1PL.EXC[SEQ]problems-DATIf he doesn’t go, we’ll get into trouble.
The second type of conditional clause is introduced by the conjunctive
phrase na=mɪsɪ, a combinaton of naˊ= ‘if’ and mɪ́sɪ ‘whether’. This type of
conditional clause may precede or follow the matrix clause. Its verb is in the
realis modality, while that of the matrix clause depends on the discourse
context but is often in the sequential apsect as it is below:
(134)Na misi tsidzuƙota ti, duƙotuo ti.
[na=mɪsɪtsídz-uƙot-atí]COND d-uƙot-u-oCONJ =whether carry-AND-REAL ADVtake-AND-3SG -SEQtí

The third type of conditional clause is introduced by the conjunction ɗɛmʊsʊ
‘unless, until’. Instead of a sequential verb, this conjunction takes a verb in
either in the realis modality or subjunctive mood. Because ɗɛmʊsʊ also can516mean ‘before’, context must determine how it is interpreted. In the next two
sentences, it is interpreted as having a temporal-conditional sense:
(136)Biraa mena nesibetii ɗemusu toida ncik.

"9.12.4 Tags
Ever given to rhetorical flourishes, Ik speakers may use one of several
interrogative ‘tags’ to solicit a response from those listening to their speech.
Each of the tags is a negated polar question to which the expected response
is in the affirmative. The following two are representative:
(191)Benia ntia?
beni-a(192)Nti.
ńtíâINTERROGńtínot.be-REAL like.thatlike.thatIs it not so?",[566]
"9.16.3 Copula clauses
Although the copula of identity (mɪt-) and the copula of cocation (i-) can be
negated with either negator verb, Ik also has two lexical verbs that function
as negative copulae. These negative copulae seem to have been (partly)
grammaticalized from the synchronic lexical verbs bɪrá- ‘lack’ and bení- ‘be
unique’. The sentences below illustrate both ways copular verbs can be
negated—first with negator verbs and second with negative copulae. Note
how morphological case suffixes change going from one type to the other:
(248)Nta ntsa iyi awak.
ńt-ánts-ai-inot-REALs/he-NOMbe-3SG home-DATShe’s not at home.awá-kᵉ556(249)Biraa ntsa awao.

(250)Nta nka mitii waanaam.

beni-aŋ́k-anot.be-REAL I-NOMwáána-ama-kᵒ
visitor-AGT.SG-COPI am not a visitor (lit ‘It is not, I am a visitor.’).
As described earlier (§9.10.1), Ik verbless copulative clauses consist of
nouns inflected with the copulative case suffix {-kɔ}. These clauses are
negated with the negative copula bení-. When this occurs, the complement
of the negative copula can take either the nominative or copulative case.
(252)(253)Ɲeƙek.","[587, 588]"
"492Ik also has a pair of negative copula verbs: bení- ‘not be (something)’ and
bɪrá- ‘not be (somewhere)’. The first negates mɪt- and ir-, while the second
negates i-. Both verbs have other, lexical meanings. The verb bení- can mean
‘be unique’, while bɪrá- can mean ‘lack’. In their capacity as negative copula
verbs, these two verbs take complements with a variety of cases:
(71)Negative copula verbs

"360The neighboring Turkana language reportedly does not allow double
imperatives (Dimmendaal 1983:183), but Ik does, as in the following:
(138)Atse zeƙwete karatsik.
ats-ezɛƙw-ɛt-ɛkáratsi-kᵉcome-IMP.SG sit-VEN-IMP.SGstool-DATCome sit down on the stool.
Negated imperatives—prohibitives— are significantly different in form from
the affirmative ones. They involve the highly irregular negating verbs ma/na- and the particle eʝá plus the negated verb as a complement in the realis
mood with subject-agreement suffixes. Prohibitives are touched on in the
next section and more fully treated ahead in §10.13.","[391, 392]"
"9.8.3 Relative clause structure
Relative clauses in Ik always immediately follow the CA in the main clause,
regardless of constituents before the main clause or after the relative clause.
Normally, the order of constituents in a main clause is VS or VAO, but when
the CA is the subject of the main clause, it can be fronted and then followed
by the relative clause and the main verb, making the constituent order SV or
AVO. This can be seen in (92) above as well as in the following:502(98)Ama na cea basaurek, isokuk.
[ám-á=[nacɛ-abasaúré-kᵃ]RC ‖ isók-ú-kᵒ]MCperson-NOM=REL.SGkill-REAL eland-ACCgo.early-3SG-SEQThe person who kills an eland goes early (i.e. before others).
The sentence in (98) is a version of (99) below in which the subject has
been put into special focus for pragmatic or stylistic reasons. (99) represents
the unmarked constituent order for the same proposition.
(99)Isokuo ama na cea basaurek.
isók-ú-oám-á =[nacɛ-abasaúré-kᵃ]go.early-3SG-SEQperson- NOM=REL.SGkill-REALeland-ACCThe person who kills an eland goes early.
The constituent order within the relative clauses themselves also departs
from that of unmarked main clauses. After the relative pronoun, then comes
the subject (if mentioned) and the verb followed by any other overtly
mentioned core arguments, peripheral arguments, adverbs, etc., making the
RC constituent orders as follows: (rel)(S)V for intransitive clauses and
(rel)(A)V(O) for transitive clauses.
Core arguments (A/S/O) can only be overt in an RC if they are not the CA
of the whole RC construction. For example, in (100), the CA tuka- ‘feather’
is recapitulated in the RC as ntsí- ‘it’, resulting in an ungrammaticality:
(100)**Ŋabiya noo tukaa na ntsia buɗam.
**[ŋáb-i-a=nootuka-a=[nantsí-á buɗám-∅]RC ]MC**wear-PLUR-REAL=PST3 feather-ACC=REL.SG it-ACC black-REAL
**He used to wear a black feather (lit. ‘a feather which it is black’).
Likewise, in (101), the CA ínó- ‘animals’ is recapitulated in the RC as ńtí‘they’ with the resulting structure being ungrammatical:503(101)**Inoa ni Icea ƙaƙiya ntik.
**ínó-a=[niicé-áƙaƙ-i-ańtí-kᵃ]RC**animals-NOM=REL.PL Ik-ACC hunt-PLUR- REAL they-ACC
**The animals that the Ik hunt them.
Ik relative pronouns are omissable but only in the non-past. In the three past
tenses, they are retained because they encode the tense of the RC. This is
similar to Turkana where the full form of relative markers are used only in
past tenses, a truncated form being used in the non-past (Dimmendaal
1983:308). Further conditions for the omission of Ik relative pronouns
include: 1) When the CA in the MC is a demonstrative pronoun (§5.5), 2)
when the CA in the MC is the head of a verbless clause, or 3) when the CA
in the MC is followed by an anaphoric pronoun. In (102), an RC modifies
the demonstrative pronoun ɗa; note the absence of a relative pronoun:
(101)Tabiduo ɗa taba tasapetik.
táb-idu-oɗ-a[táb-atasapetí-kᵃ]RCtouch-2SG- SEQone-NOMtouch- REAL initiation-ACCAnd (you) touch upon those (i.e. stories) that are about initiation.
In the next example, the MC is a verbless clause whose head is a noun
marked with the copulative case. This noun is functioning as the CA. Here
again, no relative pronoun is present:
(102)Ntsuo atsimee awak.
ntsú-ó [ats-ím-é=e
it-COPawá-kᵉ]RCcome-1PL.EXC-REAL=DP home-DATIt’s (the hour) (when) we come home.
In this third and final example, the singular anaphoric pronoun =ꜜdéé
comes between the CA and the RC, with no intervening relative pronoun:504(103)ama dee bara
ám-á=ꜜdéé[bar-a]RCperson-NOM=ANPH.SGrich-REALthat rich person (lit. ‘that person (who is) rich’)
The number of verb-form types allowed in an Ik relative clause is restricted.
For positive polarity, only realis forms are allowed. For negative polarity,
only irrealis forms are allowed. Other forms, like sequential, simultaneous,
and optative, cannot function as the predicate of a relative clause.
Relative causes can be negated. To negate one, the sequential negator moo
(and allomorph noo) is used just after the relative pronoun. If the subject of
the relative clause is overt, then it follows the negator. Being negated, the
main verb of the RC then appears in its negative (irrealis) form, as in:
(104)jejeika dii nuu moo epanid
jéje-ik-a=ꜜdíí=[nu-umo-oep-anɪ ́=dᵋ]RCskins-PL-NOM=ANPH.PL=REL.PL not-SEQ sleep-IPS=DP

"We still haven’tǃIn both (154) and (155), the two independent clauses on the lefthand side
can be seen as the matrix clauses for the two simultaneous clauses on the
right, even though the speakers are different.
Lastly, when paired with the interrogative pronoun nꜜdɛ́ɛ ́ ‘from where’, the
simultaneous aspect can be used elliptically to form a negative statement:
(156)Otsiike ndee?
ots-íí-kenꜜdɛ́ɛ ́climb-1SG-SIML from.where
I’m not climbing (lit. ‘I climbing from where?).",[401]
"355As indicated in (113), Ik has {-ɪnɛˊ} as a special 1SG optative suffix. Heine &
König point out that the suffix could also be analyzed as {-nɛˊ} (1996:82).
Without further information, it is difficult to know which analysis is better.
The following two sentences exemplify the use of {-ɪnɛˊ}. Note that the form
ƙóne ‘Let me go’ in (121) is irregular in the paradigm for the verb ƙa- ‘go’:
(121)Tebetine ɲemeleku awoo ne.
tɛ́b-ɛt-ɪnɛɲɛ́mɛlɛkʊ́awó-ó=neget-VEN-1SG[OPT ]hoe[OBL]home-ABL=MED.DEM.SGLet me get a hoe from that home.
(122)Ƙone sabak.
ƙó-nesaba-kᵉgo-1SG[OPT ]river-DATLet me go to the river.
The 1PL.INC optative, marked with the invariable suffix {-anoˊ}, could also
be called the ‘hortative’. The optative-hortative mood is used to encourage
or command a group of people of which the speaker is a part. Since it is
inherently 1st person, it is usually translated into English as ‘Let us…’:
(123)Iɗimano ɲamiili na.
ɪɗɪm-anoɲámɪɪlɪ=nafix-1PL.INC[OPT ] bicycle[OBL]=DEM.SG

The subjunctive mood (along with negative polarity) is the quintessential
irrealis mood in that it is zero-marked. That is, it is recognized
morphologically by the subject-agreement suffixes surfacing in their
underlying forms. Syntactically, it is recognized by a couple of conjunctions.
The subjunctive mood is used to encode propositions that are contingent
and temporally unrealized. Note that the ‘subjunctive’ as intended here
differs from that found in previous Ik studies (e.g. Heine & König 1996,
König 2002) which is called the ‘simultaneous’ aspect in this grammar.
The following table presents the subjunctive mood paradigms for the verbs
fút-és ‘to blow’ and bɛr-ɛ́s ‘to build’:

"9.9.4 Purpose
The notion of purpose is expressed primarily through nominalized verbs
acting as complements (see §9.12.2). However, two other types of
subordinate clause can also convey purpose: 1) one with a sequential verb,
or 2) one introduced by the Teso-Turkana conjunction (í)koteré, which in
this instance means something akin to ‘so that…’. Moreover, these two types
can be combined so that a sequential clause is introduced by (í)koteré.
In the first example below, the verb is marked grammatically only with the
sequential impersonal passive suffix. But semantically, it implies that when
the thing in question becomes a certain way, it is for a certain purpose.
(121)Irese koto nti?
[ir-ese=kótóńtí]PURPOSEbe-SPS=thenhowSo that it’s like how?
In this second example, the conjunction (í)koteré introduces a third person
negative imperative whose expressed purpose is that people do not laugh:511(122)Taa kotere maa roɓa fek.
taa[kóteré má-ároɓ-afek-ᵃ]PURPOSEQUOTso.that not-REALpeople- NOM laugh-REAL(That) so that people don’t laugh.
The last example shows (í)koteré introducing a purposive sequential clause:
(123)Kotere ikautoo cikam.
[kóteré ɪkáʊt́ -ɔ-ɔcɪkám-∅]PURPOSEso.that cool-3SG -SEQwomen-NOMSo that the women cool it (i.e. food).","[542, 543]"
"9.13.1 Complement clauses
Complementclauses(COC L)inIkarerecognizedbytheinitialcomplementizer toimɛna- that introduces them. This complementizer is a
lexicalization of two roots: tódˋ- ‘speak’ and mɛná- ‘words, issues’, resulting
in a compound that means something akin to ‘saying (that)…’. Despite its
verblike meaning, toimɛna- behaves grammatically as a noun: a) It fills an
argument slot in the matrix clause, and b) it inflects for case.
Ik complement clauses evolved out of reported speech constructions (see
§9.14). Technically, it is the quotative complementizer toimɛna- ‘saying’ that
functions as the core argument of a matrix clause, while the ‘complement
clause’ itself is treated as a direct quotation, i.e. the complement of toimɛna-.
So point #2 of (193) is only true insofar as one considers the whole
construction to be grammaticalized such that toimɛna- plus the direct
quotation fill the argument slot of the matrix clause.
In terms of functional possibilities, toimɛna-clauses can fill the syntactic slots
for object (O), copula subject (CS), copula complement (CC), and oblique
peripheral argument. In (194), the complementizer toimɛna- is in the536accusative case, indicating that it and the clause it complementizes is the
object (O) of the transitive verb ɦye- ‘know’ in 3SG:
(194)Nta ɦyei toimenaa sitsʼa noo tatatieakwa nti.
ńtá ɦye-itátáti-e̯akw-a ńtí]CoCl]O[toimɛna-a [sítsʼ-á=noonot know-3SG COMPL-ACC engage-REAL=PST3 aunt-man-NOM ADV
He doesn’t know that (his) uncle got engaged like that.
In the next example, a toimɛna-clause is functioning as the copula subject
(CS) of a verbless clause. The copula complement (CC) of the verbless clause
is ntsí- ‘it’ which appears as ntsú-ó ‘it is…’ in the copulative case:
(195)Ntsuo toimena tezetoo menaicika muɲ.
ntsú-ó [toimɛn-a
it-COPCOMPL-NOM[tɛ́z-ɛt-ɔ-ɔmɛná-ícík-ámuɲᵘ]CoCl]CSend-INCH-3SG- SEQissues-PL-NOMallIt’s that all the issues have ended.
The next example features a complement clause functioning as the copula
complement (CC) of the negative copula verb bení-. With this verb, CCs
typically take the copulative case, and this sentence is no exception:
(196)Benia toimenoo mitida ceki na gaan.
beni-a[toimɛnɔ-ɔ [mɪt-ɪ ́d-aceki=náɡaan-∅] CoCl]CCnot.be-REAL COMPL-COP be-2SG-REAL woman[OBL]=REL.SG bad-REAL
It’s not that you are a bad woman.
In the next example, the complement clause is treated morphologically
(with the oblique case suffix) and syntactically (noun in a series following
ńda) as a peripheral argument. The origin of toimɛna- as an introducer of
reported speech comes out clearly in this example: a) An audience for the
reported speech is encoded as the extended object cɪkámée ‘to the women’
which even separates the complementizer from the quotation, and b) the
quotative particle taa, otherwised used in quotative formulae, is present:537(196)Nda toimena cikamee taa ƙoyuo koto sedikak.
ńda [toimɛnacɪkámé-etaa [ƙó-yúo=kotoséd-ika-kᵉ]CoCl]OBLand COMPL[OBL] women-DAT QUOT go-IMP.PL=then garden-PL-DAT
And saying to the women that ‘you go then to the gardens’.
Because toimɛna-clauses can express either factual or potential propositions,
they exhibit a wide range of possible verb and clause types. With some
verbs, like bɛ́ɗ- ‘want’, even hortatives and optatives can occur:
(197)Beɗa toimenaa taa goƙaaketano.
bɛ́ɗ-á[toimɛna-a taa[ɡoƙ-aak-ét-ano]CoCl]Owant-REALCOMPL-ACCseated-DISTR-VEN-HORTQUOTHe wants us to all be seated (lit. ‘He wants that let’s all be seated’).
(198)Beɗida toimena yumetine ceki?

As seen in (196) and (197), the quotative particle taa (a phonologically
reduced form of kʊta ‘s/he says’) often accompanies toimɛna-. This particle
functions as an optional introducer of reported speech (see §9.14). The Ik
‘saying’-words toimɛna- and taa can be compared to similar forms in
neighboring Teso-Turkana languages. For example, in Karimojong, the
complementizer a-tɛmar is also the verb ‘to say’ and the quotative particle
ɛbɛ́ is an irregular 3SG form of the verb ábala, also meaning ‘to say’.
Lastly, complement clauses are negated just like non-complement clauses:
(199)Nesibia toimena nta zeƙwidi atik.
nesíb-i-a[toimɛn-a[ńt-ázɛƙw-ɪ ́dɪátí-kᵉ]CoCl]Ohear-1SG-REALCOMPL-NOMnot-REALlive-2SGFILL-DATI hear that you don’t live in, um…","[567, 568, 569]"
"The third function of the copulative is to mark the complement of a copula
clause (CC) with the negative copula bení-. If the copula subject (CS) is
mentioned, as in (169) and (170), then it appears in the nominative case:
(168)Benia ʝa ngok.
beni-a=ʝáŋɡó-kᵒCCnot.be-REAL=ADVwe.EXC-COPIt’s really not us.
(169)Benia noo cwoo kiɗaa.
beni-a=noocuó-óCCki=ɗá-áCSnot.be-REAL=PST 3water- COPMED=ones- NOMThat was not water.
(170)Benia njinio ɗa goƙisina nee ne?
beni-aɲjíní-oCCɗ-aCSnot.be-REAL we.INC-COP one-NOMɡoƙ-ísin-ané-é=nesit-1PL.INC-REAL here-DAT =DEMAre we not the ones seated here?
Despite what the preceding sentences show, complements of the negative
copula of identity bení- can also appear in the nominative case. Or perhaps
in the following two examples, the nouns in the nominative case are in fact
the copula subjects whose complements are understood from the context:
(171)Benia ʝa nk.
beni-a=ʝáŋ́k-ᵃCS/CC?not.be-REAL=ADVI-NOMIt’s just not me.",[319]
"4799.3Basic clause structureThe ‘clause’ is defined here as the minimal unit of syntactic organization
that includes a verbal element, finite or non-finite. Thus it encompasses the
‘verb phrase’ (predicate and any modifiers) and any ‘noun phrases’ (nouns
and any modifiers) needed to fill the predicate’s argument slots. The notion
of ‘verb phrase’ per se will not be dealt with further since the ‘clause’
includes the verb phrase by definition. Having discussed noun phrases in the
last section, this one takes up the topic of basic Ik clauses: unmarked main
clauses, subordinate clauses, and various types of marked main clauses.
Other specific topics covered in later sections of this chapter include
questions, reported speech, comparative constructions, and negation.
Ik exhibits a strict VSO constituent order in basic unmarked main clauses.
This puts it in a ‘word-order’ typological category with Ancient Egyptian, a
few Chadic languages, much of Eastern Sudanic (notably Eastern Nilotic),
and possibly some Berber and other Afroasiatic languages (Creissels
2000:252). It distinguishes it from other regional languages like Dhaasanac
(SOV) and Dime (SOV). Though Teso-Turkana languages are classified as
VSO, a VOS order is also common (Dimmendaal 1983:68). But VOS is not
attested in Ik. Like some of the controversially analyzed VSO languages in
Africa, Ik exhibits both VSO and SVO constituent orders. However, in Ik,
SVO is restricted to subordinate clauses, which are described below in §9.4.
Ik’s VSO constituent order along with its total lack of synchronically
functional prefixes is one of its ‘remarkable’ typological properties (Heine &
König 1996:123). This property, along with the subordinate clause SVO
contituent order, suggests that VSO may be a wholesale syntactic structure
replicated from the historically influential Eastern Nilotic languages.
A ‘basic clause’ is defined here is a simple, declarative statement with a 3SG
subject, realis modality, and positive polarity—in other words, functionally
and semantically unmarked. As noted above, the order of core constituents480in an Ik basic clause is VSO, or more precisely, VS in intransitive clauses and
VAO in transitive clauses. In (30) below, the noun ŋókᵃ ‘dog’ is functioning
as the subject of the intransitive predicate ep- ‘sleep’. And in (31), the same
noun is acting as the subject of the transitive predicate átsʼ- ‘gnaw’ with ɔká‘bone’ as its object. Note how the subject follows the verb in each example,
and how the object follows the subject in (31):
(30)Epa ŋok.
ep-aVŋók-ᵃSIntransitive=VSsleep-REAL dog-NOM
The dog is asleep.
(31)Atsʼa ŋoka oka.
átsʼ-áVŋók-áA ɔká-kᵃOTransitive=VAOgnaw-REAL dog-NOM bone-ACC
The dog gnaws a bone.
Tense clitics fall between the main verb and its first overt argument, as in:
(32)Epa bee ŋok.
ep-áV=beeŋók-ᵃ Ssleep-REAL=PST2dog-NOMThe dog slept (yesterday).
(33)Atsʼa noo ŋoka oka.
átsʼ-áV=nooŋók-áAɔká-kᵃOgnaw-REAL=PST 3dog-NOMbone-ACCThe dog gnawed the bone (a while ago).
When peripheral arguments and other adjuncts like adverbs are put in a
clause, these fall after any core constituents. For example, if the peripheral
argument kurú ‘in the shade’ is added to (32) from above, it comes after
both the verb and the subject, as in (34) below:481(34)Epa ŋoka kuru.
ep-aVŋók-áSkurú-∅PERIPHERALsleep-REAL dog-NOMshade-ABLThe dog is sleeping in the shade.
And if an adverb like hɪ́ɪ́ʝᵓ ‘slowly’ is added to (33), it comes after the verb,
tense clitic, subject, and object, as in:
(35)Atsʼa naa ŋoka okaa hiiʝ.
átsʼ-áV=naaŋók-áAɔká-áOhɪ ́ɪ ́ʝᵓADJUNCTgnaw-REAL=PST 1dog-NOMbone-ACCslowlyThe dog gnawed the bone slowly (earlier today).
If the arguments, core or peripheral, have modifiers, these modifiers directly
follow the NP heads they modify. The next three examples are variations of
(34), showing where respective NP modifiers occur:
(36)Epa ŋoka ncie kuru.
ep-aV[ŋók-ásleep-REAL dog-NOMɲci-e]S kurú-∅PERIPHERAL

"288(172)beni-áɗ-a CS/CC?ɲjíní-enot.be-REAL one.SG-NOM we.INC-GEN
Is it not (the one of) ours?
In closing, the question must be asked: Is the Ik ‘copulative’ really a case?
As mentioned above, Cushitic parallels for the Ik copulative case suffix {-kɔ}
are analyzed variously as suffixes, clitics and ‘markers’ more generally. In
strictly morphological terms, the morpheme {-kɔ} certainly patterns like all
the other Ik case suffixes: 1) It has an identical segmental shape as that of
the dative and accusative cases, 2) it undergoes identical morphophonological alternations as the others suffixes, and 3) it fills the same
nominal suffixal position as the other case suffixes. Then in syntactic terms,
it patterns with other cases in that it is required to mark a unique argument
(complement) in a specific clause type: a negative copula of identity clause.
Thus it is analyzed in this grammar as a ‘case’ proper, synchronically.
Nevertheless, the copulative case has some peculiar properties that set it
apart from all the other cases. First, apart from its function in marking a
copular complement, the copulative does not encode grammatical relations
of a noun with a predicate or a noun with another noun in a noun phrase.
When it marks a noun, either in a cleft-construction or in a verbless copula
clause, the noun fills the predicate slot. In that position, the noun with the
copulative suffix can be followed by adverbial and tense-marking enclitics
that otherwise come directly after true verbs. So in this sense, the copulative
has a function more characteristic of a verbal morpheme.
Asdiscussedbelowin§6.4.1,Könighastracedachainofgrammaticalization from an old focus marker (cf. the Cushitic parallels) to
both the copulative suffix in the nominal system and the sequential aspect
marker in the verbal system (2002:349-361). And so it would seem that the
Ik copulative case shows the traits of a transitional form between a nominal
and verbal morpheme. This might help explain its cross-categorial behavior.","[319, 320]"
"The only difference between the two sentences in (237) is phonological: The
final vowel of the 3PL suffix is fully voiced in the interrogative mood.
Past tense realis clauses are negated with ma-/na- in the realis modality
(and/or present perfect aspect?; see last paragraph on p. 583), with the
negated verb as a complement in the irrealis modality:
(238)Maa naa ƙod.
má-á=naaƙó-dⁱnot-REAL=PST 1 go-2SG[IRR]
You didn’t go (earlier today).
Subordinate clauses and sequential medial clauses are negated with
moo/noo, which is analyzed here as the negator verb ma-/na- plus the
sequential aspect suffix {-(k)ɔ}. As with the realis máa/náa, the negated
verbal complement of moo/no is in the irrealis modality. Examples include:553(239)Relative clause:ɗa moo ƙodid
ɗ-amó-oƙó-di=dᵉone-NOMnot-SEQ go-2SG[IRR]=DPthe one (that) you don’t go to
(240)Chained clause:...moo ƙod.
mo-oƙó-dⁱnot-SEQ go-2SG[IRR]
...and you don’t go.
An interesting structural feature of Ik negation is that while the negator
verbs function as the main verb of the clause and are marked for an
impersonal 3SG subject, the subject of the negated verb, if overt, fills the
normal syntactic slot for subject. Compare the following sentences:
(241)Ƙoyaa bee nk.
ƙó-í-a=beeŋk-ᵃgo-1SG-REAL=PST2 I-NOM
I went (yesterday).
(242)Maa bee nka ƙoi.
má-á=beeŋk-aƙó-íⁱnot[3SG ]-REAL=PST 2I-NOMgo-1SG[IRR]I didn’t go (yesterday).
In (241), a normal VS intransitive clause, the removed past tense clitic =bee
follows the verb and is then followed by the overt subject ŋkᵃ ‘I’. Then, in
(242), the tense clitic follows the negator verb as it would a main verb. The
clause’s semantic subject, ŋ́ka, then follows the tense clitic as if it were the
subject of the negating verb. However, it is in fact the subject of the
complement verb ƙóíⁱ that follows it. It is interesting to note that in most
types of subordinate clauses, any overt preverbal subject would take the
accusative case. So in (242) there seems to be a mismatch between syntax554and semantics: The syntax treats ŋ́ ka like the main clause’s subject, while
semantically, it is the subject of the following complemental verb ƙóíⁱ.
Ik can only negate full dependent and independent clauses. It has no
derivational processes for creating negative lexemes. Neither can smaller
clausal constituents like noun phrases be negated morphologically. They can
be negated syntactically and semanticaly by first being topicalized. To
illustrate this, the verb bɪrá- ‘not be’ in the following sentences negates
various clausal arguments that are modified by headless relative clauses:
(243)Biraa ama iya naye na.
bɪra-aám-ánot.be-REAL person- NOMi-anaí-é=nabe-REALhere- DAT =DEM.SGNobody is here (Lit. ‘There is no person (who) is here.’).

help-INT -3SG=DPHe is helping nobody (Lit. ‘There is no one he is helping.’).
(245)Biraa keda ƙaad.
bɪra-akéd-aƙá-á=dᵉnot.be-REAL place-NOM go-REAL=DP
He’s going nowhere (Lit. ‘There is no place he is going to.’).","[584, 585, 586]"
"I’m not going now.tsʼɔɔ4247.12 Epistemic qualification
Ik employs three methods for qualifying the certainty of knowledge
expressed in a statement. Knowledge that is not completely certain, that is
made on inference from observed evidence, may be expressed with a set of
morphologically complex ‘inferential’ particles (§7.12.1). Knowledge gained
counter-expectationally is marked at the clausal level through a special
combination of verbal modality and nominal case marking (§7.12.2). And
lastly, knowledge expressed as a way to confirm a state of affairs is marked
by a special usage of temporal particles (§7.12.3). Quite unlike evidentiality
in some other languages, these epistemic devices are not part of an
obligatory inflectional system in Ik. They are simply an available means to
qualify the status of one’s knowledge communicated in a proposition.","[455, 456]"
"423The following sentences offer a comparsion of the three non-past terms:
(294)Nƙaƙesia tsʼoo.
ŋƙaƙ-es-í-átsʼɔɔeat-INT-1SG-REALPRESI will eat just now.
(295)Nƙaƙesia taa.
ŋƙaƙ-es-í-átáaeat-INT-1SG-REALFUT2I will eat later/next time.
(296)Nƙaƙesia far.
ŋƙaƙ-es-í-áfareat-INT-1SG-REALFUT3I will eat in the future.
A non-past tense adverb can occur pre-verbally in subordinate clauses like
the one below where it is used with an irrealis impersonal passive verb:
(297)Naa fara ƙwaatetanie wicea,...
náafaraƙwaat-ét-anɪ ́-ɛ́wicé-áCONJFUT3bear-INCH-IPS-SIMLchildren-accWhen children are born in the future,…
And unlike the past-tense clitics, the freely occuring non-past tense
adverbials can precede or follow the negated verb in a negative clause, e.g.:
(298)Nta tsʼoo ƙoi.","[454, 455]"
"7.12.1 Inferential
When Ik speakers make an inference about something based on any
observable evidence, they may use an ‘inferential’ adverbial particle.
Because the knowledge expressed is only inferred, it has a degree of
uncertainty. This inferentiality can be translated in English with such
phrases as ‘it seems’, ‘it appears’, ‘X must have…, and ‘apparently, …’.
The inferential adverbials—also called markers of ‘uncertain past’ (Heine &
König 1996:80)—are made up of the conjunction-like particle na and the
past-tense enclitics presented in (287) above (except for the removed past
form which uses -tsamʊ instead). Both elements are clitics themselves, and
so they fuse easily into one phonological word. So in addition to encoding
inference, the inferential adverbials are conveniently tensed:
(299)Inferential adverbials
NFFFRecent (PST1)ná=beená=batsᵉearlier todayRemoved (PST2)ná=tsamʊná=tsamyesterdayRemote (PST3)ná=nooná=nokᵒbefore yesterday425The inferential adverbials may come before or after the main verb, with no
significant difference in meaning, for example:
(300)Nabee ƙa.Ƙaa nabats.ná=beeƙa-∅ƙa-aINFR=PST1go-REALgo-REAL INFR=PST 1It seems she has gone.ná=batsᵉShe has gone, it seems.","[456, 457]"
"475From a syntactic point of view, Ik employs three types of possessive
construction: 1) A possessee NP head followed by a possessor NP in the
genitive case, 2) a possessor noun and a possessee noun joined in a
compound, in that order. Ik speakers claim there is no difference in meaning
between these two types. 3) The third type of possessive construction is
complex. It consists of a compound with the possessor as the N1 and the
possessum morpheme ɛnɪ ́- as the N2. These two elements alone comprise a
possessive noun phrase, as in ɲj-ɛ́n ‘mine’. But then the possessee can be
specified by putting it in a genitive phrase after the NP head. This
construction can be termed ‘pertensive’ (Dixon 2010b:268), given that the
possessee bears the traditional marking for possessor (the genitive case):
(14)NP possessive constructions
1awa ɲ́cihome I:GEN‘my home’2ɲ́ci-awI:OBL-home‘my home’3ɲj-ɛ́ná awáᵉI[OBL]-PSSM home:GEN‘my home’The types of semantic relationships that Ik possessive constructions can
express include those in (15)-(21). According to Dixon (2012b:263), Ik
would fall into that group of languages worldwide that shows a
comparatively wide range of such relationships:
(15)Ownership:nƙaƙa nti
ŋƙáƙáńtí-∅food-NOMthey-GENtheir food
(16)Whole-part:riʝaaƙw
ríʝá-aƙw-ᵃ

ɪɓááŋ-as-awicé-∅foolish-ABST-NOMchildren-GENthe foolishness of children
(19)Orientation:koo kwaro awae

(20)Association:mucea taŋaikini

(21)Nominalization:arutetona ebae
arút-ét-on-aɛ́ba-ᵋsound-INCH-INF- NOMgun-GENthe sound of a gunshot
Ik also uses verbal means to express possession. For example, the verbs tír-és
‘to hold’, i-on ‘to be’, and i-ona ńda ‘to be with’ are all common verbal
alternatives alongside the NP possessive constructions in (14). These verbs
used in this way often translate as ‘to have’. The first, tír-és, is a transitive
verb whose subject would be the possessor and object the possessee. Due to
its high degree of agency, this verb is restricted to human possessors:477(22)Tirida ɲakalama?
tír-íd-aɲákalám-ahold-2SG-REALpen-NOMDo you have a pen (lit. ‘Are you holding a pen’)?
(23)Biraa koroɓaa tiri.
bɪra-akɔ́rɔ́ɓá-atír-í-∅not.be-REAL thing-NOM hold-1SG-REAL
I have nothing (lit. ‘There is nothing I am holding’).
The second ‘have’-verb—i-on ‘to be’—is the language’s locative/existential
copular verb. Used in a possessive way, this verb takes the possessee as its
subject and the possessor as a peripheral argument in the dative case, e.g.:
(24)Iya ɲakalama ncik.
i-aɲákalám-a ɲci-kᵉbe-REAL pen-NOMI-DATI have a pen (lit. ‘There is a pen to me’).
To negate the kind of possessive clause in (24), one has to substitute the
negative locative copula (bɪrá- ‘not be there’) and put the possessor (or more
precisely, the ‘un-possessor’) in the ablative case:
(25)Biraa ɲakalama ncu.
bɪra-aɲákalám-a ɲcu-∅not.be-REAL pen-NOMI-ABLI have no pen (lit. ‘A pen lacks from me’).
The third verb, i-ona ńda ‘to be with’, combines the locative/existential
copula i- with the preposition ńda ‘and/with’. The possessor is the subject of
the verb, and the possessee is a peripheral argument in the oblique case.
When negated with the verb bɪrá- ‘lack’ the oblique-case possessee is marked
on the subordinated verb i- ‘be’ with the dummy pronoun enclitic {=ˊdɛ}:478(26)Iyida nda ɲakalamu?
i-íd-ańꜜdaɲákalámʊbe-2SG-REALwithpen[OBL]Do you have a pen (lit. ‘Are you with a pen’)?
(27)Biraa ɲakalama iyiaad.
bɪra-aɲákalám-a i-í-á=dᵉnot.be-REAL pen-NOMbe-1SG-REAL=DPI don’t have a pen (lit. ‘A pen is lacking that I am with’).
The Teso-Turkana languages bordering Ik, like Karimojong and Turkana,
also convey possession by means of locative/existential copulae. In the
following examples (from Mantovani 1963:9, though morpheme glosses are
my own), the verb ayakau ‘to be (there)’ has the meaning of ‘to have’:
(28)Eyai iyong aite.
eyaííyoŋbe:3SG you:DATáite
cowYou have a cow (lit. ‘A cow is to you’).
(29)Eyakasi iyong ngaatuk.
eyakási íyoŋŋáâtukbe:3PL you:DATcowsYou have cows (lit. ‘Cows are to you’).","[506, 507, 508, 509, 510]"

"7.6Dummy pronominal cliticThe particle {=ˊdɛ} is used to mark the absence of a peripheral argument
from its usual post-verbal position. It was already treated under §5.10 due
to its having a pronominal function, and the reader is referred there for
more details on its meaning and syntactic function. Heine was the first to
recognize this particle, which he called the ‘dummy pronoun’ (1983:119).
He also pointed out that the dummy pronoun may be a grammaticalization
of the singular anaphoric demonstrative =ꜜdɛ́ɛ ́ described ahead in §8.2.3.
The dummy pronoun is analyzed as an enclitic in this grammar because no
verbal affixes—no matter which or how many—can come after it.
An initial survey of regional languages indicates that {=ˊdɛ} can be linked
most strongly to the Afroasiatic language family. From within Cushitic, Afar
has a ‘positional indicator’ eda- (Mahaffy n.d., p. 29), while the ‘locative
postpositioned clitic’ of Saho has the form -dde or -d (Banti & Vergari
2005:14). Switching subgroups, the South Omotic language Dime’s ablative
marker -de has the meaning ‘from’ or ‘out of’ (Mulugeta 2008:57). If the Ik
dummy pronoun is related historically to the Dime ablative suffix, this could
mean that {=ˊdɛ} in Ik developed into a purely grammatical morpheme.
The dummy pronoun enclitic has a L tone on its vowel but a preceding
floating H tone. This floating H is posited on the basis of the H tone that
usually appears on the preceding tone-bearing unit. Since the /d/ in {=ˊdɛ}
is a depressor consonant, the floating H may have been lexicalized in order
to compensate for the depressing effect of the depressor consonant. The
dummy pronoun is a recessive morpheme that has the allomorph /=ˊde/
when attached to [+ATR] stems. The dummy pronoun is also subject to341vowel assimilation, segment loss in non-final forms, and final-form
devoicing, giving it the numerous allomorphs presented in (82). The finalform allomorphs, with devoiced vowels and segments, sound a lot like [t ̪].
And the allomorphs /=ˊɛ/ and /=ˊe/ have at times been confused with the
dative case non-final allomorph /ɛ,e/ (e.g. Heine & König 1996:25).
(82)Allomorphs of the dummy pronoun {=ˊdɛ}

=ˊi
=ˊɔ
=ˊo
=ˊde
As noted above, the dummy pronoun (DP) always occurs last on the verbal
stem, regardless of other preceding verbal suffixes. The trio of examples in
(83) show its position, even as more and more suffixes are added:

identify because of its many allomorphs (shown in 82 above). Each of the
non-final allomorphs listed in (84) is given one example below:

But on a 1SG verb, the unreduced allomorph of the dummy pronoun is found
clause-medially, as shown in (90). This is apparently to avoid an interrupted
sequence of three vowels, each belonging to a distinct morpheme:
(90)Ntsuo naa imoɗiade bik.

modality and aspect-marking suffixes, as well as tense-marking and
epistemic clitics and particles. This section examines the verbal affixes that
express sentential modality, that is, how speakers perceive the predication
in terms of its actuality, likelihood, or relevance. The modal notions
conveyed by these affixes include reality, necessity, and desire.
In the Teso-Turkana languages surrounding Ik, the most basic verbal
distinction is perfective versus imperfective aspect. Not so in Ik: Instead, the
most basic distinction is a modal one between irrealis and realis. Heine was
the first to take note of this, though he called the realis the ‘aorist’—“the
most unmarked tense…that denotes actions or states in the past, present, or
without reference to time…” (1983:132). König also recognized this modal
distinction, claiming that “the morphologically unmarked realis form is used
for present and past contexts, the derived irrealis form (expressed by the
suffix -es-) covers future” (2008:83). So up to now, realis was thought to be
unmarked, and irrealis was through to be marked by the suffix -ɛ́s/és.
Contrary to Heine and König (1996:84 [typed as 73]), it is claimed here that
the irrealis, rather than the realis, is the morphologically unmarked member
of the pair. It is also claimed that neither irrealis nor realis have anything to
do with time or tense per se. Though realis forms cooccur with tense clitics
far more often than irrealis ones, irrealis verb forms can also cooccur with
tense clitics. Finally, the suffix -ɛ́s/és which König posits as the irrealis suffix
is analyzed in this grammar as a marker both of ‘intentional’ modality (cf.
Serzisko 1992) and imperfective aspect.
The verb form that Heine termed ‘the most unmarked tense’ and König
called ‘the morphologically unmarked realis’ is identified by the suffix {-a}.
The meaning and function of this vowel has long perplexed researchers
studying Ik. Crazzolara deemed this vowel ‘meaningless’ (1967:9), while344Tucker called it a ‘complemental suffix’ without further explanation
(1971:349). Heine labeled it the ‘thematic final vowel’, which he recognized
as also characteristic of his ‘absolute’ nominal case (1983:132). Because this
vowel was found on verbs in basic declarative sentences in past, present,
and future tenses, it was assumed to be an unmarked realis form, e.g.:
(91)Atsida nak.
ats-íd-a=nakᵃ
come-2SG -?=PST 1
You came (earlier today).","[372, 373, 374, 375, 376]"
"Aninterrogative copula with the form -ko is also found in the Southern Cushitic
languages Alagwa and Burunge (Mous 2012:398). Suggesting a link with the
Ik copulative’s focalizing function, Eastern Cushitic’s Dhaasanac has an
enclitic =u called a ‘nominal focus marker’ (Tosco 2001:60, 268-269).
The copulative case suffix is L-toned but can take a H tone from a preceding
stem (T7). It is a recessive suffix that harmonizes to /-ko/ after a [+ATR]
stem. The copulative does not delete stem-final vowels but rather affixes
directly to them. Before a pause, the it is devoiced to /-kᵓ/, /-kᵒ/ or /-k̚/.
When the it attaches to a stem-final /i/, the /i/ is backed to /u/ in partial
assimilation to the vowel in the case suffix. And if the stem-final vowel is /ɪ/
or /a/, it may be partially or totally assimilated by the case suffix. Lastly, if
a stem ends in a high back vowel (/ʊ/ or /u/), that vowel may desyllabify,
causing the non-final copulative suffix to lengthen in compensation.

(163)Copulative case grammatical functions
1Mark focus in a cleft construction2Mark the complement of a verbless copula3Mark the complement of a negative identity copulaThe first function of the copulative is to mark an argument that has been
brought into discursive focus by being fronted before the main verb. The
result is a cleft-construction that means something like ‘It is X (that)...’. The
fronted constituent can be a subject, object, or any peripheral argument:
(164)Subject:Ngoo naa ikametim.
ŋɡó-ó=naaɪkam-ɛt-ɪ ́m-Øwe.EXC-COP=PST 1catch-VEN-1PL.EXC-REALIt is we (who) captured (him).

others[OBL]It is (why) it is shared with others.
The second function of the copulative is to mark nouns functioning as the
complements of verbless copula clauses (VCC). VCCs provide an example of
when a noun non-canonically functions as a clause’s predicate. The
copulative case makes this possible by verbalizing the noun. No
corresponding subject is needed, though it may be inferred contextually:287(167)Amak.","[317, 318, 319]"
"4187.11 Tense markers
Tense in Ik is a grammatical category that is not reflected in verbal
morphology per se but rather in a group of tense particles. The past tenses
are expressed by a class of particles analyzed as enclitics because a) they
participate in vowel harmony and b) are also in the second position of the
clause (§7.11.1). By contrast, the non-past tense particles are treated as free,
syntactically mobile adverbial words (§7.11.2).
In the Ik tense system, there is a three-term past tense and three-term nonPast tense distinction. These six terms are presented in (279) along with the
enclitics and adverbial particles that encode them:
(279)Ik six-term tense system

they can also less commonly occur with irrealis verbs in the simultaneous or
sequential aspects, for example here in (280):
(280)Tense enclitics with different TAM types
Realis:ɡaan-át-a=batsᵉ‘They were bad yesterday.’Simultaneous:ɡaan-áti-e=batsᵉ‘they being bad yesterday.’Sequential:ɡaan-iní=i=batsᵉ‘And from there they were
bad yesterday.’4197.11.1 Past tense clitics
As noted above, the past tense particles shown in (279) are analyzed as
enclitics for two reasons: 1) They participate in vowel harmony within the
phonological word, and 2) they are usually the second element in the
clause. Vowel harmony only affects the remote =nɔɔ and removed =bɛɛ
since the recent past =náa contains only /a/. If the morpheme to which
these recessive clitics attach is [-ATR], then they remain the same. But if the
morpheme is [+ATR] the clitics are harmonized to =noo and =bee. In the
following four examples, the [-ATR] verbs átsʼ- ‘eat’ and ʃɪk- ‘hang’ are first
separated from the tense clitics by the dominant opaque [+ATR] realis
suffix {-a+}. This suffix harmonizes the tense clitic but not the verb stem. In
the second set of sentences (right column), no [+ATR] suffix intervenes,
and so the underlying [-ATR] forms of the clitics are allowed to surface:
(281)(282)Atsʼuƙota nok.","[449, 450, 451]"
"Besides the interrogative low boundary tone evident in (166) and (67), one
may detect a slightly higher overall pitch level for the polar question. This
higher pitch level does not affect tone at the lexical or phrase level but527merely raises the relative pitch of the whole sentence. The degree to which
the pitch is raised seems to be tied to the level of emphasis or emotion
behind the question. For more on the intonational tunes of indicative,
interrogative, and ‘solicitive’ sentences, refer back to §3.3.5.
Some further examples of Ik polar questions include these below. For each
clause-final element, its final form is shown in square brackets to indicate
how it would look if the clause were indicative instead of interrogative:

In principle, any word, phrase, clause, or sentence in the language can be
questioned in a way that expects a confirmation or denial. Whatever
grammatical category the questioned element belongs to, it will be in its
non-final form together with the low boundary tone of interrogative528intonation. In (172) and (173), it is a simple NP that has been questioned,

"2896.4‘Case’ and grammaticalizationFormal parallels or homophones of the nominal case suffixes are found in
other subsystems of Ik grammar. These are most richly attested in the verbal
system (§6.4.1), though they are also found on demonstratives, relative
pronouns, and tense particles (§6.4.2). This homophony has led to claims
that Ik case is marked on ‘conjunctions, postpositions, prepositions, adverbs,
and even verbs’ (König 2008:81). But this is misleading because most of
these word classes are really nouns or verbs in Ik. The notion that nominal
case suffixes grammaticalized into verbal inflectional affixes is one of the
key claims of König 2002. Using her methodology, Schrock 2013 traces out
several other potential grammaticalization pathways going from nominal
case suffix to verbal affix. The picture emerging from this work is that due
to its near ubiquity, ‘case’ is a unifying structural element in the language.
Unless the traditional definition of case is revised to include functors outside
the nominal system, it is useful to speak of ‘case’ and ‘Case’ in Ik. The
former is a way the language encodes grammatical relations, and the latter
is a meta-categorial or mono-systemic archi-morphology whose precise
origin and path of grammaticalization is not always known. In some
instances, there is a demonstrable semantic link between a form in one
system and its parallel in another, but in other instances, there is not.
Up to now it seems to have been assumed in the literature that nominal case
suffixes are prior, being the source of parallels found elsewhere. A less
explored but equally possible scenario is that all the various formal parallels
in the different subsystems all come from a yet undiscovered source. Until
much more descriptive and historical-comparative work is done in the Horn
of Africa, the origin of these morphological types may remain out of sight.","[320, 321]"
"6.3.3 Instrumental
The instrumental case suffix {-ɔ} may have an areal parallel in the South
Omotic language Dime’s locative suffix -ó (Mulugeta 2008:55)—no other
possible links have been identified. Regardless, the Ik suffix has L tone but
may take a H projected by the noun stem’s melody. It is a recessive suffix
harmonizable to /-o/ by a [+ATR] stem. Like the nominative, it deletes the
noun stem’s final vowel. Before a pause, the instrumental suffix is devoiced
to /-ᵓ/ or /-ᵒ/. And in these final form allomorphs, it may be reduced257phonetically to mere labialization on the stem-final consonant (especially
nasals). Often, the labialization is not audible at all but only visible.
An interesting further trait of the instrumental suffix is that, while it is
devoiced before a pause, it is never deleted. Even if devoiced, it minimally
leaves a trace of labialization. So this is an example where the grammar
overrides its tendency to delete devoiced vowels for the sake of meaning.
For if {-ɔ} was allowed to be deleted, it would be ambiguous with the
nominative case suffix which may be fully deleted. The following table
shows the presence of the suffix, irrespective of the preceding consonant:

argument expressing any of the following six semantic roles:
(71)Instrumental case semantic roles
1Instrument/Means2Path3Comitative4Manner5Time6Occupative Aspect258First, the instrumental case is used to encode peripheral arguments that
denote an Instrument or Means by which an action is realized. The
following two sentences illustrate this specifically ‘instrumental’ case role:
(72)Kokese akina makulik.
kɔk-ɛsɛak-ɪn-amakúl-ík-ᵒclose-SPSmouth-POSS.PL-NOM grass.over-PL-INSAnd its openings were closed with grass covers.
(73)Taa buƙa noo bia ino tana?
taabuƙ-a=noobi-aín-ótaná-∅QUOTmarry-REAL=PST 3you-ACCanimal-INS how.many-REALSo he married you with how many animals?
A culturally relevant usage of the instrumental case to encode the Means
role involves the verb bɪ́r-ɛ́s ‘to avail, assist with’. In Ik collective society,
one is expected to share any acquired resources, from snuff tobacco to meat
to clothing to water, etc. The preferred phrase used to acquire assets from
another person is constructed with the formula bɪ́rɛ́ NP[OBL] NP-INS, in other
words “Assist me/us with X.” A couple of examples will suffice:
(74)Bire nci cwo.
bɪ ́r-ɛ́ɲ́cicu-ᵒassist-IMP.SGI[OBL] water-INS‘Assist me with water (or ‘Give me water.’).
(75)Biroo ngo nƙaƙ.
bɪ ́r-ɔ́ɔŋɡoŋƙáƙ-ᵒassist-IMP.PLwe.EXC[OBL]food-INS‘Assist us with food (or ‘Give us food.’).
When requests like the one in (74) are made, the peripheral argument may
be dropped. This formulaic request is so often used it is typically259phonetically reduced to something like [brɪ ́ɲc̚]. Such a reduced surface
form seems to have given rise to the phrase brinji lotop ‘Give me tobacco’ of
Colin Turnbull’s fame (1972:299). His phrase can actually be parsed as:
(76)“Brinji lotop.”
bɪ ́r-ɛ́ɲ́cilɔ́tɔ́ɓ-ᵓ→assist-IMP.SGI[OBL] tobacco-INS[brɪ ́ɲtʃi ̥ lɔ́t ɔ́ɓ̥̚ ]‘Assist me with tobacco (or ‘Give me tobacco.’).
Second, the instrumental case is used to encode peripheral arguments that
denote a Path: a place by or through which a motion or action is realized:
(77)Atsimaa sabo didik.
ats-ima-asab-odidi-kᵉcome-1PL.EXC-SEQriver-INSup- DATAnd we came up by way of the river.
(78)Ŋatiini awoo xaino gai.
ŋat-í-íniawó-óʃa-in-oꜜɡáírun-PLUR-SEQhome-ABLdirection-POSS.PL-INSbothAnd they ran from the home by way of both directions.
Thirdly, the instrumental case is used to encode peripheral arguments that
denote an entity with which an agent goes somewhere. This role is
‘instrumental’ in that the agent takes an object somewhere by the hand to
thereby achieve some goal. This case role is most common with inanimate
objects or animate entities that have little control over the event. The
following two sentences show this Comitative role of the instrumental case:
(79)Ƙoyaa naa kuruɓad.
ƙó-í-a=naakúrúɓád-ᵒgo-1SG-REAL=PST1 things-INS
I went with (my) things.","[288, 289, 290, 291]"

Lochiyo Gax Gabriel(197?-2011)Lopuwa Paul(198?-2014)Ik friends whose lives were cut short by sicknessForeword
This book contains a grammar of Ik, not the grammar. It is really just a ‘state
of knowledge’ report of one individual non-Ik linguist at one point in
history. Of the many topics covered in the following pages, some are no
doubt incorrectly analyzed, while others could probably have been correctly
analyzed in more than one way. And then, of course, the ways of phrasing
the descriptions of each linguistic entity number to infinity.
Trying to capture the grammar of a living language linearly on paper is a
little like photographing an elusive wild animal. As it darts through the
underbrush, you snap your photo. What the photo captures is true: the
shape and contours of the animal, its color and patterns, its mode of
movement. But as true as the photo may be, it in no way does justice to the
living beast. In the same way, a written grammar can trace the structural
features of a language: its phonemes, morphemes, syntactic structures. But
seen in light of the living language in use, the grammar pales in comparison.
Even after completing this project, all I have to do is walk through the
neighborhood, overhear a conversation, or attend a public function to learn
something totally new about the language. After cataloguing all the
phonemes, morphemes, and many lexemes, I can still hear a string of Ik
speech whose meaning escapes me entirely. I have tried to write a true
description of Ik, but the language in use is much more colorful...and alive.
With this grammar I have also tried to initiate a philological tradition for
Ik—‘philological’ in the etymological sense of ‘love of learning’, yes, but also
in the sense of language study from written sources. From now on, one can
study Ik from books alone, perhaps furthering the inquiry into the
relationships between East African languages and where they came from.
Attending to these questions is attending to the people who speak these
languages, and this is one way we can communicate our love for them too.","[17, 18, 19]"
"3917.9.3 Impersonal passive
The suffix {-anɪ ́-} acts as the marker of an ‘impersonal passive’ construction.
At first glance, {-anɪ ́-} seems to be related to the ‘stative’ suffix {-án+-}
(§7.10.3). This superficial resemblence led to {-anɪ ́-} being analyzed as
stative as well (Serzisko 1992:202). But the two suffixes differ crucially in
their underlying tones and [ATR] values and thus cannot easily be linked.
The impersonal passive {-anɪ ́-} is an opaque recessive suffix that blocks
[+ATR] harmony spread from a dominant stem. Its tone is LH, but that can
change in the tonal environment of the stem, as seen in examples below.
The construction marked by {-anɪ ́-} is called ‘passive’ because it
syntactically omits any subject (A/S), leaving it to be inferred pragmatically.
And it is called ‘impersonal’ because a verb with {-anɪ ́-} invariably has 3SG
zero-marking, regardless of the person and number of any implied subject.
The impersonal passive can occur with transitive or intransitive verbs. With
transitive verbs, the A is omitted, and the O is promoted to S only in terms
of surface grammatical relations (marked by case suffixes). That is, the
subject of an impersonal passive verb is marked with the NOM case in main
clauses. This contrasts it with the So ‘impersonal’ (Carlin 1993:85), the
Toposa ‘passive’ (Schröder 2008:59), and the Turkana ‘impersonal active’
(Dimmendaal 1983:72)—all of which retain object-marking for the patient.
However, in most types of subordinate clauses, the patient of an Ik
impersonal passive is also encoded as the object (O). So there is a mismatch
in alignment between main and subordinate clauses. This seems to indicate
transitional forms—the impersonal passive/active being a Kuliak calque
from Teso-Turkana (or earlier) that is now being reanalyzed in Ik due to a
prohibition against marked objects without subjects in main clauses.
The examples below illustrate these properites of the impersonal passive.
First, in (207), presents a normal impersonal passive construction: No agent392is encoded (except an impersonal one), and the patient is encoded as an S in
the NOM case. Then in (208), an ungrammatical clause shows that nothing
but an impersonal subject can be marked on the impersonal passive verb:
(207)Inomesana bi.
ɪnɔ́m-ɛ́s-an-abi-∅beat-INT-IPS-REALyou.sg-NOMYou will be beaten (Lit. ‘It will be beaten you.’).
(208)**Inomesanida bi.
**ɪnɔ́m-ɛ́s-án-ɪ ́d-abi-∅**beat-INT-IPS-2SG -REAL you.SG-NOM
**You will be beaten.
Second, the sentence in (209) shows an impersonal passive construction as a
subordinate clause acting as the complement to the verbless copulative ntsúó
‘It is...’. Note that the patient now receives double object-marking: 1) It is
postverbal, whereas most subordinate clause subjects are preverbal, and 2)
it has the ACC case. Then compare it with (210), where the patient is cast as
the subject of the impersonal passive verb—the result is ungrammatical:
(209)Ntsuo inomanee bik.
ntsú-ó [ɪnɔ́m-án-é=e
it-COPbeat-IPS-REAL=DPbi-kᵃ]CC
you.SG-ACCThat’s why you are beaten (Lit. ‘It is (why) it is beaten you.’).
(210)**Ntsuo bia inomanad.
**ntsú-ó[bi-aɪnɔ́m-án-á=dᵉ]CC**it-COPyou.SG-ACCbeat-IPS-REAL=DP**That’s why you are beaten.
Semantically, it can be said that in impersonal passive clauses, the point is
not ‘who did what’ but only that something got done. This would help393explain why the impersonal passive is also used with intransitive verbs. The
point is to be as indirect as possible about the agents/people involved and
focus only on the fact that something has taken place. The following three
examples are fairly common sayings heard among speakers in daily social
interaction. The impersonal passive construction serves the Ik well in their
proclivity to be curious and inquiring without being direct and rude:
(211)Atsana awoo?
ats-an-aawó-ocome-IPS-REALhome-ABLAre you coming from home (lit. ‘Is it come from home’)?
(212)Kutana is?
kʊt-an-aissay-IPS-REALwhat[OBL]What do you say/what are people saying (lit. ‘It is said what’)?
(213)Epesana ndaik?
ep-és-án-andaí-kᵉsleep-INT -IPS-REALwhere-DATWhere will you/people sleep (lit. ‘It will be slept where’)?
And finally, a few examples from other natural discourse contexts:
(214)Cemana emutik.

s/he-ACC3947.9.4 Sequential impersonal passive
The suffix {-ɛsɛˊ} is the morphological marker of the ‘sequential impersonal
passive’. Absolutely no etymological parallels for this suffix have been
found. This suffix is recessively [-ATR], having /-ese/ as an allomorph on
[+ATR] verbs stems. Before a pause, {-ɛsɛˊ} is reduced to /-ɛs/ or /-es/. Its
underlying tone is LL(H), the floating H tone being posited on the basis of
the H tone it places on a following L-tone-bearing unit. Its own tone melody
can change, for example to HL on stems ending in H (T7) or LH before the
dummy pronoun {=ˊdɛ}, as in ats-esé=dᵉ ‘And people came from there.’
In terms of meaning and function, the sequential impersonal passive (SPS) is
a marriage between the sequential aspect and the impersonal passive
described in the previous section. It does for the sequential aspect what the
impersonal passive does for every other non-sequential clause type. Briefly,
it eliminates any subject (A/S) and promotes any object (O) to subject (S).
One might say that the SPS takes impersonalness a step further than the
impersonal passive in that its morpheme (-ɛsɛˊ) is so suppletive in contains
no 3SG marker—nor any subject-marker at all. It is an agentless passive par
excellence, having neither a syntactic nor morphologically encoded agent.
The SPS differs from the impersonal passive in one other way: Even in
subordinate clauses where the patient assumes an object’s postverbal
syntactic slot, the case-marking on that argument remains NOM, for example:
(216)Na enuƙweese bi, ceiƙweese bi.
na=en-úƙó-esébi-∅cɛ-ɪ ́ƙɔ́-ɛsɛ́bi-∅CONJ =see-AND-SPSyou.SG- NOMkill-COMP-SPSyou.SG- NOMWhen you are seen, you are killed.
Like the impersonal passive, the SPS also occurs with intransitive verbs, e.g.:395(217)Ƙeese waa loɗiwei.
ƙe-ese wa-alóɗíwéí-∅go-SPS harvest-NOMplant.sp-GENAnd then one goes to harvest the Maerua angolensis plant.
As part of the sequential aspect paradigm, the SPS is used in long strings of
discursively (co-)subordinate clauses such as the following:
(218)Itsuŋƙweese riʝika tokobimak.
ɪtsʊ́ŋ-ƙɔ-ɛsɛríʝ-ík-aburn-COMP-SPS forest-PL-NOMtɔkɔ́b-ɪma-kᵒˊ

The sequential impersonal passive cannot be negated in and of itself. If a
clause with the SPS needs to be negated, the sequential aspect negator moo is
employed with the second (negated) verb in the impersonal passive voice.
To illustrate this, (219) presents an affirmative sequential impersonal
passive sentence, followed by its negative version in (220):396(219)Honetiakoo ragw, ceiƙweesed.

"7.10 Adjectivals
Dixon asserts that every language has an adjectival word class, regardless of
how similar it may be to either nouns or verbs (2010:62). Crosslinguistically, ‘adjectives’ tend to be distinguished as a distinct word class
based on relative similarities or differences between them and nouns or
verbs. The following diagram presents a typology of ‘adjectives’ in which
similarity and difference are modeled as spatial distance (Dixon 2010:66):
(237)a)NOUNb)NOUNc)
d)ADJECTIVE
ADJECTIVE
NOUNNOUNVERB
VERBADJECTIVE
ADJECTIVEVERB
VERB402According to this typology, Ik is a type (a) language whose adjectives
exhibit many verb-like characteristics. So many that, despite Dixon’s
assertion, ‘adjectives’ are treated here as an ‘adjectival’ subset of intransitive
verbs instead of their own, separate word class. This is because,
morpologically and syntactically, they are just like other intransitive verbs.
Nonetheless, their semantics do cover categories traditionally handled by
adjectives, as shown below. And a handful of suffixes are found only on
‘adjectival’ verbs, also as described in the following sections.
The semantic properties encoded by adjectival verbs include the following:

semantic properties by being the head of a clause’s predicate. In (248), the
intransitive verb i- ‘be (somewhere)’ fills the clause-initial slot for main
verbs, as does the adjectival verb maráŋ- ‘good’. This syntactic slot reserved
for verbs (in unmarked clauses) as well as the verbal realis affix {-a} show
that maráŋ- is functioning as the predicate head in example two of (248):
(248)Iya Ɲakuj.","[433, 434, 435, 436]"
"129[ƙaátanaamuɲu]The third intonational pattern, called the solicitive tune, is used to solicit
agreement from the hearer. It is often heard in the following contexts: 1)
making polite requests or gentle commands, 2) making statements subject to
the hearer’s approval, and 3) ensuring the hearer’s attention. The solicitive
tune can apply to both main clauses and subordinate clauses (even ones
preceding the main clauses of declarative statements or questions.)
The solicitive tune is marked by a low-rising (LH) boundary tone. Unlike the
indicative and interrogative tunes, the final morpheme of a clause can
appear in either its non-final or final form. When the final form occurs,
vowels normally devoiced surface as voiced so as to link to the low-rising
tone to a tone-bearing unit. But because a) the LH boundary tone applies
only to the clauses’s final vowel and b) contour tones in Ik must link to two
phonological TBUs, the final vowel is doubled for the solicitive tune:

[ƙaátanaamuɲuú]4 Nouns
As one of language’s ‘evolutionary primitives’ (Heine & Kuteva 2007:59),
nouns comprise one of Ik’s two large open word classes (the other being
verbs). The present chapter begins with an overview of noun roots (§4.1)
moving on then to nominal suffixes (§4.2), compounds (§4.3), and several
types of onomastics (§4.4.-§4.5). Case marking, a crucial feature of the
nominal system, is treated in Chapter 6 on the way to the wider grammar.
In Ik, a noun is any word whose primary function is to be the head of a
noun phrase, which in turn functions as an argument of a verb. As the head
of a noun phrase, a noun must be inflected for case to show its relation to
other words. It may also take other nominal suffixes and may be joined to
another noun or pronoun in a compound construction. A second function of
an Ik noun is to be the head of the predicate. To fulfil this function, a noun
must take the copulative case marker (§6.3.8), which is the functional
equivalent of a copula and allows the noun to stand alone as a sentence.
Semantically, the prototypical Ik noun refers to inanimate and animate
objects, people, and places—anything in the world that is viewed as an
inherent non-event. However, the boundary between things named by
nouns and events named by verbs is fuzzy. Many lexical event concepts can
become nouns with noun morphology or verbs with verb morphology, e.g.:
(1)Lexemes ambiguously nominal or verbal
botá-‘migrate’ƙɔ́ɗɛ́-‘cry’cooka-‘shepherd’ɔfa-‘cough’deƙu-‘quarrel’sáɡo-‘snare’ɗɔanɪ ́-‘weed’sʊpa-‘breathe’epú-‘sleep’taatsa-‘pay’féí-‘bathe’taʝala-‘give up’132fekí-‘laugh’tɔkɔba-‘farm’ɪ ̯ana-‘talk’tɔkɔra-‘distribute’ɪƙɪra-‘write’tɔlɔka-‘trap’ɪrɛʝa-‘slash grass’tɛwɛa-‘broadcast seed’iruɓa-‘chew hard foods’tóda-‘speak’isira-‘decorate’tsuwaa-‘run’ɪtsɪka-‘order’wáána-‘pray’ɪwara-‘plaster’waté-‘rain’ƙaƙa-‘hunt’zɛƙɔ́-‘sit/stay’Ik nominal morphology is minimal—four being the maximum number of
morphemes a single noun can have (outside of compounds). Compare this to
Turkana nouns which may have up to eleven morphemes (Dimmendaal
1983:208)ǃ Any Ik noun in a post-lexical grammatical context consists
minimally of a lexical root plus a case marker. Besides the case marker, the
only other nominal suffixes are number and possession markers. The order
in which these occur is ROOT-(NUMBER)-(POSSESSION)- CASE. Unlike Turkana
and Dhaasanac, Ik has no grammatical gender marked on nouns. Ik
compensates for its minimal noun inflection by joining nouns and pronouns
together in a variety of compounds. Thus, meanings expressed by affixes in
other languages are expressed by a compound construction in Ik.
In their basic underlying forms, every Ik nominal root and suffix ends in a
vowel, without exception. This final vowel is unpredictable since it can be
any of the language’s nine contrastive vowels. Because of this, these final
vowels are treated universally as part of the root in Ik. Similar ‘terminal
vowels’ in the East Cushitic Dhaasanac are only viewed as part of the stem
in some cases where they “are by and large meaningless elements…[maybe]
ancient desemanticized gender markers” (Tosco 2001:65). And like the
Omotic language Dime (Mulugeta 2008), Ik has some nouns whose rootfinal vowel has two free variants, e.g. kɔlá~kɔlɛ́- ‘goat’ and zɪná~zɪnɔ́‘zebra’. Such cases seem to arise along the lines of chronolects and idiolects.","[160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"
"540A second complementation strategy employed by Ik is clause chaining. After
a main verb there may follow a sequential or simultaneous clause acting in
a complementary role. If the subordinate clause is sequential, then it
expresses an activity occurring after the main verb, either logically or
chronologically. If the subordinate clause is simultaneous, then it expresses
an activity loosely cooccuring with the main verb (see §10.2).
The deontic verb ɪtámáán- ‘behoove, necessitate’ (cognate with TesoTurkana ɪtamakɪna) serves to illustrate both types of clause chaining since it
can occur with either one. In first example (205), ɪtámáán- acts as the main
verb in the initial main clause, followed directly by the sequential verb
déíduo ‘and you (sg.) bring’ which is complementary to it:

(‘It behooves, and you bring all the various kinds.’)
The next example involves ɪtámáán- again but this time with a simultaneous
clause containing the simultaneous verb form bɛ́ɗɛ́tɪ́ɪ́kᵋ ‘I looking for’:
(206)Itamaana beɗetiike konienia awee bik.

The table in (207) presents a representative sample of Ik verbs that can take
a toimɛna-complement as an argument. If any of these verbs uses other
complementation strategies as well, these are also shown:541✓✓en-‘see’✓✓✓ikoŋ-‘swear’✓ɪtámáán-‘behoove’ɦye-‘know’kʊt-‘say’✓

✓nesíbˋ-‘hear’✓tam-‘think’✓tódˋ-‘speak’✓tɔnʊp-‘believe’✓tópéɗ-úƙót-‘be able’✓✓9.14 Reported speech
The Ik quote formula for reported speech consists of the verb kʊt- ‘say’ with
a subject-agreement suffix cross-referencing the speaker. This is then
followed by the addressee in the dative case if mentioned. After this may
come the quotative particle taa (a reduced and grammaticalized form of
kʊta ‘s/he says’, like the Turkana irregular verb form ɛbɛ́ used as a
quotative; Dimmendaal 1983:470), and then of course the quotation itself:
(208)Reported speech:kʊt-SPEAKER (ADDRESSEE-DAT) (taa) SQUOTEA couple of examples of this quotative formula in context are as follows:542(209)Kutia ntsie, “Itemat.”
kʊt-ɪa-antsí-é[itém-át-ᵃ]QUOTEsay-1SG-SEQs/he-DATbefit-3PL-REALAnd I said to her, “They are right.”
(210)Kutata biraa koroɓaa ŋabat.
kʊt-át-a[bɪra-akɔ́rɔ́ɓá-aŋáb-at-ᵃ]QUOTEsay-3PL-REALlack-REALthing-NOM wear-3PL-REALThey say there is nothing they are wearing.
As Serzisko correctly pointed out, both direct and indirect speech can be
reported with the direct quote formula given above (1987:72-73). In other
words, when the verb kʊt- is involved, both types of reported speech are
encoded grammatically as if they were direct quotations. An indirectly
encoded quotation would require that the quotation be a complemental
argument of the verb. But this is not possible with the kʊt- formula.
Rather, as expected crosslinguistically (Kroger 2005:226), a quotation found
in the formula above is not treated as an argument of the verb kʊt-. Instead,
it is an extra-syntactic sentential ‘complement’. This can be seen in Ik from
two angles. First, unlike the complementizer toimɛna- (§9.13.1), the
quotative particle taa is invariable, that is, not inflected for case. Second,
when the content of an indirect quotation is the interrogative pronoun isi‘what?’ instead of a full sentence, isi- takes the oblique case, the case that is
used for, well, oblique arguments. This can be seen in the next example:
(211)Kutana taa isi roɓa?
kʊt-an-atáá[isi]QUOTEsay-IPS-REALQUOTwhat[OBL] people[OBL]It is said (that) what, people?
What shall we say, folks?[roɓa]VOCATIVE543If a quote in Ik were treated grammatically as an argument of the verb (as
in indirect quotes), nominative case (for 1st and 2nd person subjects) and
accusative case (3rd person subjects) would have to be indicated somewhere,
e.g. on a complementizer or on isi- if it was filling the quotation slot.
Compare the following grammatical and ungrammatical sentences:
(212)Kuta is?","[571, 572, 573, 574, 575]"
"171.2.2 Typology
The difficulty in classifying Ik genetically stems largely from its unique and
eclectic typological profile among other languages in East Africa. This
typological profile is summarized below and illustrated with an annotated
text. The goal of this section is to give the reader an overall impression of
the language—a sort of typological Gestalt―in case there is no time to read
through each chapter in detail. The overview begins with phonology and
then proceeds through morphology, syntax, and finally the annotated text.
In terms of phonology, Ik has thirty-nine (39) contrastive sounds: thirty (30)
consonants and nine (9) vowels. Consonants made with pulmonic airstream
include plosives, affricates, fricatives, liquids, nasals, and glides. Those
made with glottalic airstream include implosives and ejectives. The three
lateral fricatives and ejectives Ik once used are now almost entirely lost.
Eight of the nine vowels consist of [+ATR]/[-ATR] pairs that operate in a
[+ATR]-dominant vowel harmony system. The low vowel /a/ is opaque but
can be lexically (morphologically) specified with either [ATR] value.
The rightward edge of an Ik phonological phrase is strictly observed. This
means that the final segment of any word or morpheme, whether consonant
or vowel, is reduced before a pause. In this reduction, consonants may be
partially devoiced and/or unreleased, while vowels are usually fully
devoiced or deleted. Devoiced consonants and vowels are allophonic, not
phonemic. Other allophonic changes observed among consonants include
nasal assimilation, place assimilation, implosivization, and debuccalization,
while other allophones among vowels arise from raising and glottalization.
At the juncture of morphemes, certain consonants may be deleted and vowel
may assimilate partially or totally to nearby vowels.
The template (C)V can generate all lawful phonological syllables in Ik, and
the concatenation of morphemes may require resyllabifications in the form
of vowel epenthesis, inter-consonantal syncope, vowel deletion, haplology,18desyllabification/compensatory lengthening, and metathesis. At the surface
level, the template (C)V(V)(C) generates all lawful phonetic syllables.
Ik is a tonal language with two underlying tone levels: H and L. Ik has
lexical tone though few tonal minimal pairs. There is no grammatical tone
in the sense of a morpheme made up solely of a tonal autosegment.
However, tone changes do accompany various segmental morphemes. Htone may surface phonetically as high, high-falling, or downstepped high
pitch. L-tone may surface as low, low-falling, or mid pitch. Voiced
obstruents function pervasively as depressor consonants, pulling the pitch of
a preceding high tone to high-falling, mid, or low pitch. Downdrift occurs,
as well as depressor-consonant induced downstep. All noun and verb roots
have a lexically assigned tone melody whose surface realization may change
according to grammatical context. Stem-level and phrase-level tonal
processes are complex and appear to count metrical feet in the
(re)assignment of tones. At the clause level, at least three intonational
patterns can be observed: the indicative, interrogative, and the ‘solicitive’.
Morphologically, Ik is mostly agglutinative. Roots and affixes can typically
be separated out linearly. Except for lexicalized prefixes on words borrowed
from other languages, Ik is exclusively suffixing. On the continuum between
analytic and polysynthetic, Ik ranks as moderately synthetic: Only three
suffixes can be attached to noun roots, while up to six can be attached to
verb roots (one more if one counts root reduplication).
In terms of form, verb roots tend to have a (V)(C)VC syllabic shape. Verb
roots can be partially or fully reduplicated, though only full reduplication is
productive. Ik verbs may be intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, or
ambitransitive. Tonal verbal minimal pairs signify only slight semantic
differences, and a small subset of verbs are inherently pluractional.
A basic morphological division in the verbal system is realis-irrealis. This
division is posited more on the basis of morphology than semantics. Other19verbal extensions include suffixes to nominalize the verb, give it directional
deixis, subject agreement, or non-core argument reference. And yet other
suffixes give the verb modal, aspectual, valency-changing, or polarity
properties. Most attributive (descriptive) notions are handled by intransitive
‘adjectival’ verbs in Ik. Tense, contrary to aspect and modality, is
communicated by clitics and lays out a three-level time deixis in both the
past and non-past. Ik uses a variety of strategies to express epistemic status.
The majority of Ik nouns have a CVC(V) or CVCVC(V) syllable shape.
Roughly one third of the nominal lexicon begins with the Teso-Turkana
gender prefix ɲV- (or one of its locative allomorphs) which as been
lexicalized in Ik. Noun roots may also be partially or fully reduplicated,
though neither strategy is productive in the language. Each noun has a
lexical tone melody that can change in various morphological and syntactic
contexts. Nominal suffixes include a two types of singulative, five types of
plurative and eight case endings. The language’s limited noun suffixation is
counterbalanced by productive (pro-)nominal compounding.
Case—an interface of phonology, morphology, syntax—is a pan-systemic
feature of Ik grammar. Not only must every noun be inflected for case, but
even some of the verbal suffixes appear to be grammaticalized case markers.
The Ik case system is split-accusative: Direct objects are marked in the
nominative case with 1/2-person subjects and in the accusative with 3person subjects. In the Ik system, eight cases are observed: nominative,
instrumental, ablative, genitive, accusative, dative, copulative, and oblique.
Nouns and verbs represent the two open lexical word classes in Ik. Other,
closed word classes include the pronouns, quantifiers, demonstratives,
adverbs, conjunctions, interjections, infantile imperatives, ideophones. The
seven personal pronouns incorporate three persons, three numbers, and an
inclusive/exclusive distinction in first person plural. Non-verbal quantifiers
and adverbs exist but are very few. Demonstratives provide spatial deixis in
three degrees of distance (near/medial/far) and temporal deixis in four20degrees of time (tense). Other demonstratives provide anaphoric reference
for either actual discourse or a shared deictic context. Lastly, Ik makes wide
use of ideophones to colorfully enhance the meaning of verbs.
In noun phrases, modifiers follow the head noun. Modifiers consist of
genitive noun phrases, adjectival verbs, quantifiers, and other relative
clauses. Relative pronouns mark the number of their noun head as well as
the tense of the predicate in the relative clause. The fullest statement of the
‘common argument’ of a main and relative clause is in the main clause. Like
in other subordinate clauses, the syntax of relative clauses is marked.
The basic, unmarked constituent order of Ik main clauses is VSO (VS/VAO),
but SVO is attested in subordinate clauses. In a main clause, the verb comes
first, followed by a tense clitic (if present) and then the subject and object(s)
if explicitly mentioned (both subjects and objects may be left implicit in Ik.)
Peripheral arguments come next, followed by any adverbs.
Clause chaining is a definitive aspect of Ik discourse. An initial controlling
clause sets the TAM context for the chain of clauses to follow. Clause chains
may consist of one or many more sequential clauses or one or two
simultaneous clauses. Chained simultaneous clauses may be used as a
complementation strategy and in bi-clausal comparative constructions.
The Ik lexicon exhibits several recognizable substrata. Perhaps the oldest
substratum can simply be called ‘Ik’ since it has yet to be tied to any other
subgroup within Africa. Ik of course shares numerous lexemes with the
other Kuliak languages, Nyang’ía and So. A handful of lexemes have
parallels in Didinga (Surmic). A fair number of Ik lexemes appear to be preor proto-Nilotic, while very many more are obviously cognate with forms in
Eastern, Southern, and even Western Nilotic. A substantial number of core
lexemes are also traceable to Afroasiatic Cushitic languages like Afar/Saho,
Dhaasanac, Tsʼamakko, and West Rift Cushitic. Finally, English (Germanic)
and Swahili (Bantu) have in recent centuries loaned quite a few lexemes.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"
"1253.3.5 Intonation
In addition to lexical and phrasal tone, Ik also uses sentence-level tone or
‘intonation’ to express meaning. Intonation is understood here as the “the
use of suprasegmental features to convey ‘postlexical’ or sentence-level
pragmatic meanings in a linguistically structured way” (Ladd 1996:6, italics in
the original). The suprasegmental feature Ik uses to alter pragmatic meaning
is a boundary tone at the right edge of the relevant syntactic unit. Three
intonational boundary tones (or lack thereof) create the following three
‘tunes’ (the symbol <%> being borrowed from Ladd 1996:80):
(78)Ik intonational tunes
#NameDefining boundary tone1Indicative Tune.................................Ø%2Interrogative Tune.................................L%3Solicitive Tune.................................LH%The indicative tune is the default, unmarked intonational pattern used for
declarative statements. This tune is defined by an absence of change on the
tone of a clause’s final word. A morpho-syntactic correlate of this tune is
that the final morpheme of the sentence will be in its final form. Take for
example the two basic statements below, each with their pitch profiles:
(79)Jʼeʝa naa awak.
ʝɛʝ-a=náaꜜawá-kᵉstay-REAL=PST1home-DATS/he stayed at home.","[156, 157]"
"4478.3AdverbsIk has a small, closed class of words that can be called ‘adverbs’ on the basis
that they are mostly monomorphemic and can modify whole clauses. Some
adverbs convey the manner of an action, while others relate the epistemic
attitude of the speaker. Other still defy any semantic characterization.
The Ik manner adverbs include the following:
(45)Ik manner adverbs
ɗɛmʊsʊ‘quickly’hɪ ́ɪ ́ʝɔ‘slowly, carefully’(also ɗamʊsʊ)ʝɪ ́kɪ ́‘totally, really’ʝíiki‘always’kɔ́ntɪ ́ákᵋ‘straightaway’(cf. kɔnɪ́- ‘one’)mʊka‘completely, forever’(also a noun mʊka-páka‘until, indefinitely’(fr. Swahili mpaka)zuku‘very, especially’(also in Nyang’í)A few of the adverbs in (45) undergo the deletion of their final consonant
segment in clause-medial environments. For example, ɗɛmʊsʊ ‘quickly’ may
be pronounced as ɗɛmʊʊ and kɔ́ntɪ́ákᵋ ‘straightaway’ as kɔ́ntɪ́ɛ́ɛ.́
Other adverbs relate the epistemic attitude of the speaker, for example:
(46)Ik epistemic adverbs
=ʝá‘just, then’(an enclitic)tsábo‘apparently’tsamʊ‘exactly, of course’(also a noun tsamʊ́ - ‘freeness’tsʼɔɔ‘probably’(marker of distended present)A handful of other adverbial particles fall together into the following group
unmarked by any particular semantic cohesiveness:448(47)Other Ik adverbs
ɛɗá‘only, alone’=ʝɪkɛ‘also, too’kɪ ́ná‘and then’naɓó‘again’=ɲá(k)a‘just’toni‘even’The adverb ʝɪkɛ ‘also, too’ undergoes non-final deletion and vowel
assimilation such that ʝɪɪ is an allomorph commonly heard in the language.
The adverb naɓó ‘again’ is cognate with Teso-Turkana nabo of the same
meaning. In both languages, it can also be used in the sense of ‘moreover’.
Adverbial functions are often handled in Ik by nouns and verbs. For
example, nouns in the instrumental or dative cases can be used to modify a
predicate. In (48) below, the nominalized verb ɪsɪ́lɔ́n ‘to be peaceful’ is given
the instrumental case to elaborate on the manner in which the person was
settled down. Then in (49), the noun kédi- ‘way’ is put in the dative case,
also to express the manner in which it was getting cloudy:
(48)Zeƙwitetesa bia isilon.
zɛƙw-ɪt-ɛt-ɛ́s-ábi-aɪsɪ ́l-ɔ́n-ʷsit-CAUS-INCH-INT -REALyou.SG-ACC be.peaceful-INF-INSHe will settle you down peacefully (i.e. with peace).
(49)Kupetaa kedia gaan.
kup-et-á-ákédi-eɡaan-∅cloudy-INCH-REAL-PRFway-DATbad-REALIt’s getting dangerously cloudy (i.e in a bad way).
Many time expressions used adverbially are in fact nouns in the
instrumental case with the suffix {-ɔ}, for example those in (50). For more
on Ik time expressions, skip ahead to §8.9.","[478, 479, 480]"
"1.3.1 Methodology
The aim reflected in this book has been to research and analyze Ik grammar
in terms of Basic Linguistic Theory (BLT) expounded in Dixon (2010-2012).
BLT is a theory of linguistics as a natural science that “consists in the study
and comparison of the grammatical patterns of individual languages” (Dixon
2010a:5). This approach makes eclectic use of the classical grammatical
tradition and the growing body of generally accepted linguistic terms,
concepts, and categories. The hope of using this methodology is that the
unique genius of the Ik language might be brought to the fore without being
overly constrained by any particular formal theory. Insofar as this hope is
realized in the following pages, people from different theoretical
backgrounds should be able to easily follow it. Given the diverse theoretical
orientations of prior linguists who have worked on Ik, this seemed to be the
best way to capture the language in a grammatical description.
Also, this grammar is primarily a form-based, analytical grammar. It is
form-based in that it seeks to exhaustively list and describe all the
grammatical forms of Ik: phonemes, morphemes, syntagmemes, and29lexemes. As much as possible, the functions of the forms are discussed as
well. By the same token, the grammar is analytical in that it breaks apart
the language bit by bit. In this sense it is designed to assist one in the more
passive skill of interpreting or decoding the Ik language. The more advanced
and culturally relevant skill of using or encoding the language appropriately
will have to await a work building on a much greater knowledge of the
language’s semantics, pragmatics, cultural matrix…and people.
In describing the forms found in Ik, an eye has been kept toward diachronic
origin and explanation. The need for this element of my approach is
captured eloquently in the following quote: “Because grammar is always
emergent but never present it could be said that it never exists as such, but
is always coming into being. There is, in other words, no ‘grammar’ but only
‘grammaticization’—movementstowardstructurewhichareoftencharacterizable in typical ways.” (Hopper 1987:148, cited in Serzisko 1992).
Diachronic exploration requires comparison with other languages in the
area. To this end, I have tried—as time and opportunity allowed—to seek
parallels for Ik forms in the non-Bantu languages of East Africa. Due to
limited library access, this comparison focused primarily on Dhaasanac
(Tosco 2001), So (Carlin 1993), and Turkana (Dimmendaal 1983).","[60, 61]"
"Iktemporalsubordinatingconjunctions are all based on the proto-demonstrative *na. Compare this
with nearby Turkana, where the ‘feminine agreement marker’ na- also
introduces preposed temporal adverbial clauses (Dimmendaal 1983:392).
(53)Temporal subordinating conjunctions
CONJClause typeGlossnáaPST1‘When...,’sɪnaPST2‘When...,’nooPST3‘When...,’na=náaPST1 Perfect‘When...had...,’na=samʊPST2 Perfect‘When...had...,’na=nooPST3 Perfect‘When...had...,’451Two other subordinating conjunctions combine notions of temporality with
conditionality. These are shown in (54). They also cooccur with verbs in the
realis modality joined to the dummy pronoun. The particle nɛ́ɛ ́ ‘if/when’
also functions elsewhere as a locative (ablative) preposition meaning ‘from
X’ (see §8.5). Compare this with the Turkana conjunction a ní ‘from’ which
also doubles as a conjunction meaning ‘if/when’ (Dimmendaal 1983:395396). The two functions of nɛ́ɛ ́ thus appear to be a calque of similar functors
in Turkana. Then the second Ik conjunction shown in (54) is just a
combination of the recent past conjunction from (53) and nɛ́ɛ:́
(54)Conditional-temporal subordinating conjunctions
nɛ́ɛ ́Conditional/non-past‘If/when...,’náa nɛ́ɛ ́Conditional/non-past‘If/when...,’Subordinate clauses with sequential verbs encode conditional and
hypothetical statements. Conditional clauses are introduced by the proclitic
particle naˊ= (the floating H being posited to account for H tones may put
on the first next syllable). Used alone, naˊ= conveys a non-past or gnomic
sense, while in combination with tensed conjunctions, it communicates past
perfect conditionals. The conditional conjunctions are shown below in (55):
(55)Conditional subordinating conjunctions
CONJClause typeGlossnaˊ=Gnomic conditional‘If...,’na=nááConditional PST1 perfect‘If...had...,’ná=beeConditional PST2 perfect‘If...had...,’na=nooConditional PST3 perfect‘If...had...,’The hypothetical subordinating conjunctions consist in the first place of the
general subordinator naˊ= procliticized to the auxiliary ƙa which is in turn
modified by tense clitics. The particle ƙa is isomorphic with the verb root
ƙa- ‘go’. It would be interesting to investigate cross-linguistically whether a
motion verb is elsewhere grammaticalized as a hypothetical marker. The452removed past form =samʊ is used instead of =bee. The PST1 perfect form
nɑ=ƙá=naa can also convey a general, gnomic hypotheticality:

different conjunctions: 1) The conjunction áta (from Swahili hata ‘even’)
introduces concessive clauses. 2) The conjunction na= introduces narrative
clauses with relative rather than absolute tense. 3) And the conjunction náa
introduces hypothetical-temporal clauses. The form náa is obviously linked
to the PST 1 conjunction, but its function is nearer to that of nɛ́ɛ.́
(57)Mixed subordinating conjunctions with simultaneous verbs
CONJClause typeGlossátaConcessive‘Even though/if...,’na=Narrative relative temporal‘When...,’náaHypothetical-temporal‘If/when...,’Four miscellaneous conjunctions remain: 1) naítá also takes verbs in the
realis modality with the dummy pronoun enclitic. In translation in means
‘Since...’, ‘Given that...’, and ‘Due to the fact that...’. It is morphologically
complex, being made up of the subordinating conjunction na plus the 3SG
verb form ít-á ‘It amounts to...’. As such, naítá can more accurately be
glossed as ‘To the degree that...’. 2) ɗɛmʊsʊ—used elsewhere as an adverb—
coincides with verbs in either the realis modality or the subjunctive mood
(irrealis). As a conjunction, it communicates the idea of ‘Unless/until...’. 3)
ɗɪ́tá—used elsewhere as a preposition—cooccurs with verbs in the realis
modality with the dummy pronoun. As a conjunction, it introduces a453similative dependent clause with the meaning ‘Like (when)...’. 4) térútsu—
used to convey a perfect aspectual sense for either present perfect or past
tenses. It may be related to the verb erúts- ‘be new’, possibly in connection
with an emphatic particle te. The conjunction térútsu is usually translated as
‘After/when...had already...’.

The true morphological marker of polar questions in Ik is the final, low
boundary-tone comprising the interrogative intonational tune. In this, Ik
differs from neighboring Teso-Turkana languages like Turkana which
append the invariable question particle -à to utterances to make a polar
question (Dimmendaal 1983:429). Heine & König posited -a as an
interrogative particle in Ik too (1996:116), but this must be based on an
incorrect analysis of the suffix {-a} which marks both nominative case and
realis modality. If either of these morphemes came clause-finally in a polar
question, it would definitely resemble the Teso-Turkana question particle.","[560, 561]"
"4598.6InterjectionsA number of words may be uttered in Ik that express a speaker’s state of
mind in response to something strongly felt. Such ‘interjections’ are of two
types: 1) Those that have no other meaning and 2) those that do:

called ‘ideophones’, forms “characterized by phonological structures that
tend to be peculiar” (Matthews 2007:183). In Ik, this phonological
peculiarity may entail extra-long vowels and multiple reduplications, as well
as expressive tonal and intonational patterns. Ik has three types of
ideophones: 1) Those that are onomatopoeic or symbolic of the sound made
by an action, 2) those that add extra vividness to a stative verb, and 3) those
paired with the verb kʊt- ‘say’ to form special phrasal verbs. Examples of the
first type—onomatopoeic—include the following:
(81)Onomatopoeic ideophones

add some semantic vividness to the verb’s meaning. These ideophones are
often paired with a particular verb, for example:

to perform certain actions. These ‘baby-talk’ particles are inherently
imperative but involve no verbal morphology. Examples include these:
(84)8.9Infantile imperatives
ɓáused to call a child to come eatbubú‘night-night’, used to encourage a child to go to sleepdɪ ́‘poo-poo’, used to encourage a child to defecatekochildren’s word for ‘water’kɔkɔ́used to warn a child not to touch somethingkukúused to encourage a child to climb on one’s backkwaa‘pee-pee’, used to encourage a child to urinatemamáused to encourage a child to eatnʊʊnʊ́used to encourage a child to nurseTime expressionsTime expressions in Ik do not make up a distinct word class. However, they
do form a special lexical subset worth taking note of. All time expressions
are nouns with case suffixes and other modifiers like demonstratives and
post-posed subordinate clauses. Their being formed from nouns recalls
Turkana adverbs of time which also originate in nouns (Dimmendaal
1983:360). As mentioned back in §6.3.3, the instrumental case is used in Ik
to mark time expressions in the context of sentences. In their isolation
forms, however, the time expressions may take the nominative case.
The names for the weekdays Monday-Friday in Ik are formed with the word
ɲákásií- ‘work’—from Swahili kazi ‘work’—coupled with a numeral
quantifier in a simultaneous clause. For example, the word for ‘Monday’
translates literally as ‘work(day) being one’. The words for ‘Saturday’ and
‘Sunday’ are borrowed from Teso-Turkana. The term of ‘Sunday’ (ɲásaɓéti-)
originates from Italian through the influence of the Catholic church:463(85)Ik days of the week

because the Ik have no indigenous alternative. At times the Teso-Turkana
names are translated directly into Ik, but these calques receive little usage.

present either in the past or the future. For the day-terms, Ik combines the
proto-temporal root *tso, the word ódou- ‘day’, or the word baratsó‘morning’ with demonstratives in proclitic and/or enclitic positions. Some of
these demonstratives exhibit phonological reduction, maybe to the point of464lexicalization. Not all the morphology in these terms is fully understood.
The day terms in (87) are presented with Wednesday acting as ‘today’:

built on the root kaɪnɪ́- ‘year’. This is also modified by proclitic and enclitic
demonstratives and exhibits phonological reduction and lexicalization. The
proclitic or prefix sá(á)- seen in both (87) and (88) no doubt is a parallel
with Dime’s (South Omotic) distal prefix sa- (Mulugeta 2008:73). In (88),
the term keináts contains the verb root ats- ‘come’, as in ‘the coming year’:

Ik greetings do not constitute a separate grammatical word class per se. But
they do consist of a variety of verb phrases and noun phrases used ritually
so as to take on pragmatic meaning beyond grammar and semantics. Given
the cultural importance of Ik greetings, they are presented below.
The most general greeting and the one usually first taught to outsiders is in
the form of a question:
(89)Iyida?","[490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497]"
"9.5.1 Auxiliary verbs proper
The auxiliary verbs ‘proper’ are lexical verbs in their own right but also
double as aspectual auxiliaries. In the Ik auxiliary verb construction, the
aspectual auxiliary fills the slot for the main verb and is the only verb
marked for subject-agreement, tense, and polarity. The semantic main verb
follows in a morphologically defective form. If the clause subject is overt, it
comes between the auxiliary and the main verb, making the constituent
order of auxiliarized clauses Aux-S-V or Aux-A-V-O, the same order found in485subordinate clauses. The only inflection found on the main verb in an
auxiliary construction is the realis suffix {-a}. It remains thus, regardless of
the various inflectional suffixes the auxiliary verb may take.
The verbs in (48) form a subset based on the fact that they all aspectually
modifyamorphologicallydefective,semanticallymainverb.","[516, 517]"
"10.1.2 Contrastive
In its most basic expression, contrast or counter-expectation (as well as
addition) can be communicated in Ik through simple parataxis, or
‘intonational coordination’ (Serzisko 1992:120). Such apposition of two
main clauses leaves the precise pragmatic interpretation up to the context.
However, the clitic-like adverb (=)kɔtɔ is typically present to enhance the
utterance with such notions as ‘then’, ‘so’, ‘and’, and ‘but’, for example:562(9)Benia ncuk, buo kot.
bení-áɲ́cu-kᵒ ‖not.be-REAL I-COPbu-o=kótᵒ

náá=koto mo-o
CONJ =ADVbɛ́ɗ-ᶦnot-SEQ want-3SGLet him save you. But if he doesn’t want to,…
Some Ik speakers, especially those having learned other languages, find
alternative ways to express contrast. This may be for example, by borrowing
a contrast word from Karimojong (naít) or Swahili (lakini).","[593, 594]"
"5189.10.1 Verbless copulative clause
Verbless copulative clauses—covered in this section—are ‘verbless’ in the
sense that they put a nominal marked with the copulative case in the
predicate slot. This construction differs from the verbless dative/genitive
clauses which are ‘verbless’ in the sense that they exhibit no predicate slot
at all in the surface structure. In verbless copulative clauses, the predicative
nominal can consist of a noun, pronoun, or nominalized verb. What allows a
noun phrase to function as predicate is none other than the copulative case
(described in detail in §6.3.8). In the copulative case, the copulative suffix
{-kɔ} affixes to the underlying form of the nominal stem:
(143)Copulative predicates
LexicalCopulativecekí-‘woman’→cekú-kᵒ‘It’s a woman’ntsí-‘s/he/it’→ntsú-kᵒ‘It’s she.’dód-oni-‘to hurt’→dód-onu-kᵒ‘It’s pain.’The copulative case enables a verbless grammatical alternative to the copula
of identity mɪt-. Though mɪt- expresses both identity and possession, the
copulative case expresses strictly identity. Serzisko further qualifies the
meaning of mɪt- as one of ascription/description’ compared to that of the
copulative which expresses ‘specification’ (1992:55ff).
Just as mɪt- takes a copula subject (CS) and copula complement (CC),
verbless clauses with nominal heads take a verbless clause subject (VCS) and
verbless clause complement (VCC; Dixon 2010:160). Ik being an eminently
argument-dropping language, the VCS is often omitted, leaving only the
VCC in the copulative case. When the VCS is present, it takes the
nominative case as would an S or A subject under most other conditions. In
the following examples, the first clause represents a standard copular
construction, while the second illustrates the verbless copula clause:519(144)Mitia nka ʝakam.","[549, 550, 551]"
"3527.7.4 Optative
The optative mood is encoded grammatically in three concurrent ways: 1) a
floating H tone (often with high-tone suppression of preceding H’s) 2)
neutralization of pre-pause devoicing, and 3) a handful of suppletive
suffixes occuring unevenly throughout the paradigm. The floating H tone
gives even L-toned verbs mid-pitch, even before a pause. The neutralization
of pre-pause vowel devoicing can be represented by an autosegmental
morpheme like {-[+voice]}. And so the following table summarizes the two
autosegmental markers together with the segmental ones:

V́→VˊV[+voice]#V[+voice]#V[+voice]#The three segmental optative morphemes all have a LL tone melody with a
floating H tone. Their tone may change to HL after a H-tone verb (T7) or to
LH before the dummy pronoun {=ˊdɛ}. The suffixes {-ɪnɛˊ} and {-ɪmaˊ} are
susceptible to vowel harmony when affixed to [+ATR] stems. The suffix
{-anoˊ}, on the other hand, is an opaque dominant morpheme that therefore
does not change [ATR] categories. It is, moreover, the only one of the three
for which areal (Cushitic) parallels have been found, namely the Saho 1PL
‘subjunctive’ suffix -no (Banti & Vergari 2005:4) and the Somali 1PL.INC
‘jussive’ suffix -no (Lamberti 1984:5)—both obviously related to each other.
The table in (114) illustrates the complex optative-marking strategy with
full optative paradigms for the verbs fút-és ‘to blow’ and bɛr-ɛ́s ‘to build’:353(114)Optative mood paradigm

the form of a resignation. And with the appropriate auxiliary verb, the
optative has been grammaticalized into use as an irrealis narrative mood.
Besides the morphological markers presented in (113), optative verbs are
also commonly recognized by the auxiliary verbs óɡo- ‘leave/let’ or talák‘let go’ occuring in the imperative mood, for example:
(115)Ogoyuo ƙaati.
óɡo-íóƙá-átiˊleave-IMP.PL ggo-3PL[OPT]Let them go.
(116)Talake atsati.
talák-éats-átiˊlet.go-IMP.SGcome-3PL[OPT ]Let them come.
The optative mood has been grammaticalized into use as a sort of narrative
mood alongside the sequential aspect. In this usage, it must be preceded by
the imperative talák-é ‘let go’ (sometimes shortened to aláké), which is
related to the Teso-Turkana -lak ‘let go’, a synonym of the Ik óɡo- ‘let/leave’:354(117)Talake atsati, talake koŋatii toboŋ.
talák-éats-átiˊtalák-ékɔŋ-átí=itɔbɔŋᵓˊlet.go-IMPcome-3PL[OPT] let.go-IMP cook-3PL[OPT ]=DP posho[OBL]And then they came, and then they cooked posho with it (a pot).
[Lit: ‘Let them come, let them cook posho with it.]
(118)Talake daŋadidi toɗoi.
talák-édáŋá-didítoɗó-iˊlet.go-IMPwhite.ant-rain[OBL] fall-3SG[OPT ]And then the white-ant rain fell.
[Lit: ‘Let the white-ant rain fall.’]
In Ik, both overt subjects and objects of imperatives take the oblique case.
Note that in (117) and (118), every clausal argument is zero-marked: Nouns
are in the oblique case, and verbal complements are in the optative (an
irrealis) mood. This type of argument-marking can be explained by positing
the optative-narrative mood as a grammaticalization of the optative mood
and the optative mood as a grammaticalization of an imperative clause.
As a narrative mood marker, taláké can be followed by verbs in the
sequential and simultaneous aspects as well as the optative:
(119)Talake ƙanetia takwiak.
talák-éƙan-ét-i-atakw-i-a-kᵒˊlet.go-IMPtake-VEN-1SG -SEQstep.on-1SG-SEQAnd then I took (it) and stepped on (it).

Dit boek omvat een analyse van het Ik (Icé-tód), een Kuliak (Rub)-taal
gesproken door 7500 mensen in noordoost Oeganda. Het levert een zo
volledig mogelijke basisinventaris van de klank/vorm/betekeniseenheden
die samen de grammatica van het Ik vormen. Het boek kan voortborduren
op een solide traditie van vijftig jaar taalbeschrijving. Desalniettemin vult
het een aantal belangrijke gaten op. De noodzaak voor een vollediger
beschrijving is nijpend gezien het feit dat de twee andere leden van de
subgroep, Nyang’ia en So/Tepeth, op het punt van uitsterven staan. Een
tweede doel van deze studie is dan ook een precieze en adequate geschreven
weergave te bieden van het Ik voor het geval, door de krachtige neiging tot
assimilatie aan het Engels en de Teso-Turkana talen uit de Oost-Nilotische
(Nilo-Saharaanse) taalfamilie, ook Ik verloren gaat. Een derde doel van deze
studie is een duidelijker beeld mogelijk te maken hoe Ik gerelateerd is aan
de andere talen in de regio, met name door parallellen voor te stellen voor
de grammaticale morfemen van het Ik.
Hoofdstuk 1 begint met een korte inleiding over het Ik-volk, hun
geschiedenis, de ecologie van hun leefgebied, economie, samenleving,
godsdienst en cultuur. Hierop volgt een inleidend overzicht over de taal van
de Ik, waarbij onderwerpen zoals de controverse rond de genetische
classificatie aan de orde komen, maar die ook een typologische
karakterisering van de taal geeft en onderwerpen als variatie, invloeden
door taalcontact, etnolinguistische vitaliteit en eerdere publicaties over het
Ik behandelt. Het hoofdstuk sluit af met een beschrijving van de
methodologie, het veldwerk, de verzameling van de gegevens en hun
beschikbaarheid, en tenslotte de spelling. Hieruit wordt duidelijk hoe het Ik
dat lange tijd in haar bestaan bedreigd was maar toch kans zag voort te
bestaan door aanpassing zonder zijn eigenheid op te geven.","[731, 732, 733, 734, 735, 736, 737, 738, 739, 740, 741]"
"9.12.3 Alternative questions
So-called ‘alternative questions’ (Dixon 2012:398-400) are made possible in
Ik through the use of the disjunctive conjunction keɗe ‘or’. This conjunction
joins noun phrases in a series or whole clauses into a complex sentence.
Apart from keɗe, Ik alternative questions are not marked by any overt
morphological or prosodic means. In the examples below, keɗe joins two534clauses that could each constitute polar questions on their own. Together
they make up a content question whose answer will be the affirmation of
one or the other. Note that the final constituent remains in its final form:
(189)Maraŋa keɗe gaan?
[maráŋ-á] keɗe[ɡaan-∅]good-REAL orbad-REALIs it good or (is it) bad?
(190)Giriana keɗe dzigwiiƙotan?
[ɡir-í-án-a]keɗekeep-PLUR-IPS-REAL or[dzíɡw-i-iƙót-an-∅]
sell-PLUR-AND-IPS-REALWere they regularly kept or regularly sold?","[565, 566]"
