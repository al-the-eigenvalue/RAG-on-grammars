‘They did not kill him then.’ (AR‐8MI‐33)The same strategy is used to negate nominal and adjectival constituents. Since
adjectives and nouns can function as predicates without any overt marking,
nominal (36)a and adjectival (36)b constituents can be negated in the same way as
verbs:

The independent form nij‐ta consists of the negative adverb nish/nij and the
middle marker ‐tA, and marks existential negation. It is not associated with a
predicate or VP it negates; rather it functions as a predicate itself:

Question‐word questions are somewhat different structurally. The three
question words ama ‘what, which (N)’, tëtë ‘what which (A)’ and ëshë ‘why’ 11 must
occur in clause initial position and can only be preceded by setting‐constituents
such as subordinate clauses, (42)a and b, communicative verbs, (42)b, discourse
linkers, (42)c, etc.:

always=NVR
‘They always hammered until they were caught by the night.’ (OR‐20MA‐1)In (83)a, there is a simple predicate ensew, modified by the adverb chajti, which directly
follows it. Even though I have never encountered chajti in preverbal position, it does
not seem impossible, especially when the meaning is stressed.
This adverb often has a wide scope. In (83)a, the scope of the adverb extends to the
location mentioned. They did not ‘always just drink’, but ‘they always drank there’. In
(83)b, the adverb has scope over the entire proposition isamaya malaya chërë. And for
(83)c, finally, the same argumentation can be given: the adverb has scope over the
whole proposition. In addition, the repetition in this example already indicates
iterativity.
There can be elements in between the predicate and the adverb, like direct objects, cf.
(84)a, applied objects, cf. (84)b, and even adjuncts, cf. (84)c:

3PL‐IO‐sit;be‐3=PL chicha=COM always=NVR
3PL‐husband=PL
‘They always waited for their husbands like that with chicha.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)It may very well be the case that chajti has a verbal origin, and to some extent it still
functions as a predicate. There are two parts recognizable within the word: cha and jti.
The latter is the marker for habitual aspect, and the former is seen in many words
based on the demonstrative ati (cf. section 4.4.4 above):
(85) ati
achu(ta)
(a)chama‘that’
‘(be) like that’
‘(do/be) like that’The word chajti then probably means ‘it is (was) always like that’. Another clue
pointing to the verbal nature of chajti, is the fact that it often occurs with the non‐213A grammar of Yurakaréveridical enclitic =ya, normally only associated with predicates (cf. section 7.1.1). On the
other hand, it does not fully behave like a verb in the sense that when two clauses are
combined there often is an intonation break and morphological marking on the
dependent predicate; if there is no intonation break, there is a fixed order, in which the
dependent predicate precedes the main predicate. Chajti does not comply with this
behavior.
The adverb lacha ‘too’ or its variant layj also seems to have a relation to the
demonstrative ati, with the specificity prefix l‐. Positionally, lacha is mostly postverbal,
either directly following the predicate or with some other element in between:

‘Then the ancestors made their arrows as well.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)In (86)a, the focus is on the mountain person’s characteristics, after telling what they
looked like and how they behaved, the adverb lacha contrasts this characteristic with
others of the mororuma. In (86)b, the former grandfathers are contrasted with other
people who are also fishing at the creek. In (86)c, finally, the whole proposition of the
former grandfathers making their arrows is marked with the adverb.
Lacha can, however, also be in clause‐initial position:

Unlike temporal and aspectual adverbs, modal adverbs tend to precede the predicate.
The negative adverb nish (~nij), the phasal adverbs kaj ‘still’, and kani ‘not yet’ as well
as sey (si) ‘almost’ directly precede the predicate:214The verb phrase(88) abcdnishbata‐p

a‐yee
almost 3SG‐AFO‐die.SG‐3=NVR
3SG.P‐sister
‘His sister almost died on him.’ (AY‐2NC‐9)The adverbs kaj, nish and sey are somewhat deviant words in that they are
monosyllabic, while there is a prohibition on monosyllabic content words. This is
something that they have in common with a number of state/manner adverbs (cf.
section 6.5.6). Manner adverbs, as we will see below, are also preverbal.
Some of the modal adverbs are morphologically transparent. The negative adverb
nish has an independent form nijta (i.e. which can occur without a verb), which seems
to be nij + ta (middle voice marker) meaning, ‘there is no(ne)’. The form nish has ‐sh,
which is an adverbializing suffix. The adverb kani also seems to be a fused form,
combining kaj and ni (negative).
Two further, epistemic modal adverbs seem to be intermediate between adverbs and
verbs: yokkoshe ‘true’ and kusuti ‘maybe’.

moon‐3=DS big‐MEA‐3=NVR
subsequently
‘After maybe two months, he was already big.’ (AR‐8MI‐27)In (89) yokkoshe and kusuti are used adverbially here. Yokkoshe, however, can occur by
itself, without a predicate to modify, a characteristic not associated with adverbs in
Yurakaré:
(90) yokkoshe mem=la
nish
ta‐n‐shiwa‐m=la
ku‐ta‐ø=w=ya

1PL‐IO‐lie‐2SG.S=VAL
3SG.CO‐say‐3=PL=NVR
‘“It is true, mother, you did not lie to us”, they said to her.’ (AR‐8MI‐31)215A grammar of YurakaréThe end of the first clause yokkoshe memla is marked by the affirmative marker =la, this
means that yokkoshe here functions as a predicate.
Kusuti seems to be a fixed expression which can be analyzed as kusu‐ø=ti, ‘if it wants’.
Kusu is a verb meaning ‘to want’, =ti is a subordinating enclitic, expressing, among
other things conditionality (cf. section 8.2.4).","[227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"
"246Propositional markersQuestions marked with the validational marker are often closed questions,
where the speaker is asking for commitment of the addressee to the truth value of
the proposition. Consider the following question‐answer pair:
(33) abyokkoshe
tiya‐m
meme=la
true
eat‐2SG.S mother=VAL
‘“Did you really eat it, mother?”’ (AR‐8MI‐25)
tiya‐y=la
tiya‐y=la
mu‐ta‐ø=ya
eat‐1SG.S=VAL
eat‐1SG:S=VAL 3PL.CO‐say‐3=NVR
‘“I did eat it, I did eat it!”, she said to them.’ (AR‐8MI‐25)In (33)a the speakers ask for commitment of the addressee to the truth of the
proposition by using the validational marker =la. The addressee then gives them
the commitment by means of the same marker =la in (33)b. The factual status of
the proposition here is that it is not true, as we, the hearers of the narrative know.
The affirmative marker on an imperative, jussive or exhortative adds pertinence
to the assignment. The speaker is commited to the realization of the event,
comparable to English emphasized ‘you have to do this’:

‘Come on! We have to make [a boat]; the water is going to take us!’ (OR‐20MA‐1)In (34)a, the validational marker is not on the final element of the clause, possibly
to avoid doubling of the syllable la.
The clitic =la does not indicate an absolute value of certainty. It is rather a value
that can be played with when telling a story, making the listeners believe that
something actually did happen (35)a, denying it after that in (35)b:247A grammar of Yurakaré(35) abma‐bobo

‘He was not going to eat them, however. When he followed them, they went
away, when he tried to grab them they had gone, and ‘dup’ he grabbed after
them, they went screaming ‘hehehe’. (OR‐19MA‐3)The validational marker can also be used to indicate the belief of a speaker in a
conditional, hypothetical, even counterfactual situation:
(36) atika‐puppu‐ta ‐ø
bobo‐ø=ya=chi
laij=la=ye
DEM 3SG‐make.loose‐POT‐3
hit;kill‐3=NVR=IGN too=VAL=NB.F
‘If he had cut that one loose, he would have killed him as well.’ (FA‐6MA‐11)This is perhaps the clearest example to show that =la has nothing to do with
factuality. The speaker knows that the event described in the superordinate clause
of the counterfactual conditional construction is non‐factual, and still the
proposition is marked with =la.
In a similar vein the validational marker can be combined with the speculative
marker ‐jtë and the assumptive marker =tiba:
(37) ablat mapa‐kka‐ø
ati‐kka‐ø=jtë
latiji=la=yu
then big‐MEA‐3
DEM‐MEA‐3=SPC
subsequently=VAL=EXPR.F
‘He was big. Probably this size.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)
a‐wështi‐ø=tiba=la=ye
3SG.P‐hunger‐3=ASM=VAL=NB.F
‘He must have been hungry.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)In (37)a the speaker commits herself to her estimation of the height of the character
of the story, and in (37)b the narrator commits herself to her assumption that the
character is hungry.7.2.2 =ri/yu: expressive
The enclitic pair =ri (for men) and =yu (for women) adds an expressive force to an
utterance, which can often be translated with English interjectional phrases like248Propositional markers“for God’s sake”, “for crying out loud” and the like. In the data that I have
collected, these enclitics mainly occur in questions which are furthermore marked
with the speculative marker ‐jtë:
(38) abam=chi
mala‐ø=jtë
latiji=ri
WH=DIR
go.SG‐3=SPC
subsequently=EXPR.M
‘Where (in the world) did he go.’ (AR‐8MI‐59)
ama‐sh‐i‐ø=jtë=yu
WH‐ADV‐VBL‐3=SPC=EXPR.F
‘How will it have been? (I don’t know)’ (DV‐14MA‐3)The combination of ‐jtë and =ri/yu marks the question as an expressive one. No
answer is expected to either of the questions in (38). In (38)a, the narrator of the
story does not know where the main character of the story went, and he knows
that no one has the answer to that question. Example (38)b is from a dialogue
where the speaker and her husband are trying to track down where one of their
plates has gone. After contemplating some of the possibilities, they come to the
conclusion that they do not know what might have happened, and the utterance
in (38)b is her final word.
The enclitics =ri and =yu in questions are also sometimes combined with the
enclitic =bë, which denotes either momentaneous aspect or demanding attention of
the hearer (cf. 7.2.5 below). In the case of a combination of =bë with one of the
expressive enclitics, the question is also expressive, but with the connotation of
pondering, thinking aloud:

kusu‐shta‐ø=bë=ri
enriki=ri

tuwa=ri
WH‐ADV.CMP‐MID 1PL‐IO‐converse‐FUT=MOM
1PL.PRN=EXPR.M
‘What shall we talk about?’ (AA‐27MA‐9)In (39)a, taken from the same dialogue as (38)b, the two speakers are wondering
what I would like to have for lunch. This speaker is asking himself aloud what
would please me. In (39)b, taken from another dialogue, I had left the two
speakers with the minidisk and told them to just go ahead and converse. So the
first speaker asks himself rather than anyone else: “What shall we talk about? (let’s
see)”.
The following utterances show that =ri/yu can be applied in a wider context than
just rhetorical questions:249A grammar of Yurakaré(40) abl‐ati‐jti=ja=la=yu
REF‐DEM‐LIM=EMPH=VAL=EXPR.F
‘But that is the only one there is!’ (DV‐14MA‐2)
buyta‐ni
së=bë=ri
chief‐INTL:1SG.S
1SG.PRN=MOM=EXPR.M
‘If only I were chief!’ [FL‐1MA‐21]The utterance in (40)a is part of the dialogue of the lost plate mentioned before.
This is an answer to a statement made by the other speaker who thinks that they
had two white plates, a plastic one and another one, but his wife says that the
plastic one is the only one they have. In (40)b there is an expression of a wish,
where =ri , possibly in combination with =bë, adds an exclamative value to the
proposition.
Day (1980) has found many more occurrences of =ri/yu. In her analysis, these
suffixes express regret or sorrow:
(41) abbenebene‐sh tuwi‐ø
i‐bonto‐shama=ri
pitiful‐ADV

1SG‐son‐PST=EXPR.M
‘How sad that my son has died!’ (Day 1980‐32)

ush(ta)=ri
why NEG
go.out‐1SG.S‐MOM
before=EXPR.M
‘Why didn’t I go out earlier?’ (regretful) (Day 1980‐32)However, regret and sorrow are too narrow labels to fit to the whole range of uses
of =ri/yu. I will come back to these enclitics and discuss some more environments
in which they occur when discussing combinations of the modal enclitics in 7.3
below.7.2.3 =ra/ye: notable information
There is another set of enclitics that differ according to the gender of the speaker:
=ra (for men) and =ye (for women). The function of these enclitics is also hard to
pinpoint, but they seem to mark the fact that the speaker thinks something is
notable for some reason:
(42) abmedia
ora‐nñu‐jti
kusu‐ø=naja
pëpë=ra
half
hour‐DIM‐LIM
want‐3=DSC
grandfather=NB.M
‘Half an hour the old one wanted (mind you).’ (FL‐14MA‐1)
shülül‐ta
mi‐dojo
më=ra
tickly‐MID
2SG‐body 2SG.PRN=NB.M
‘Your body is tickly’ (FL‐14MA‐1)250Propositional markersIn (42)a I had told the speaker that they should converse for half an hour. When
during the conversation the speaker starts wondering when it would end, he
reminds his interlocutor that I had said half an hour. In (42)b the speaker touches
the body of his daughter and she starts to laugh, so he remarks that she has a
tickly body. The ‘notable information’ function becomes clearer in the following
example of Day (1980):
(43) matat‐uma‐ø=w=la mesa=w=ye
big‐DST‐3=PL=VAL
table=PL=NB.F
‘What huge tables!’ [DAY‐1980‐32]Sometimes the use of =ra/ye seems to have an epistemic value. It is not clear how
this use is related to the ‘notable information’ use:
(44) rene=tina
bali‐ø=w=ra
Rene=COM go.PL‐3=PL=NB.M
‘They will have gone with Rene.’ (FL‐14MA‐2)7.2.4 =se: repetition/emotion
The enclitic =se has several functions. So many in fact, that it is virtually
impossible to come up with an adequate characterization of the enclitic, therefore I
gloss it ‘SE’.
First of all, =se marks repetition, which is essentially aspectual, and can often be
translated with English ‘again’. In this reading the enclitic seems to be related to
the adverb yosse ‘again’:

I will just show a number the functions of =se that I have found:

‘Every single day they went bathing.’ (AR‐8MI‐65)It might be that =se here simply means ‘again’: “Every single day they went

nature. It might either be disapproval, since the narrator disapproves of them
bathing every day and not working, or it might be that it adds disbelief in the
sense of the English phrase: ‘Can you believe that!’

=se means ‘again’ and (46), where =se is used in comparisons do not contain the
same morpheme as in (47)‐(60), where =se mainly adds emotional value.
Furthermore, it is not clear how to account for the range of inferences in (47)‐(60).7.2.5 =bë: momentaneous/attention particle
The meaning of the enclitic =bë is hard to pinpoint. It seems to have two different
meanings, and is often used in conversation in various circumstances.
In many circumstances, the particle means ‘for a while’, like in (61)a and b,
indicating that the event will take up only a short while. In this sense it is an
aspectual marker. However, in example (61)c, this interpretation is harder to254Propositional markersmaintain. It rather seems to mean something like getting attention, somewhat like
English ‘hey!’. In this sense it is a particle that functions on the speech‐act level as
an address particle.

sentence. Only in (63)a the speaker directly addresses someone, (63)b and c the
question is rather rhetorical, which does not match with the use of an addressing
particle, nor does there seem to be a straightforward momentaneous
interpretation.
Finally, the enclitic particle is also found on declaratives:

3SG.P‐wife=MOM
‘When he arrived, he gave his wife a beating.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)The interpretation that can be given here is ‘at that specific moment’. This is
especially clear in example (64)b, where the speaker realizes that he has made a
mistake in talking about Tiri at that specific moment in the story, because he had
not been born yet. In (64)a and c, reference is made to a specific, relatively short
period in time where background clauses mark the circumstances associated with
that period of time. In (64)a, during the period that the subject of the background
clause was hitting them, they let the object go; in (64)c, the moment of arriving
coincides with the slapping.
Summarizing, =bë is used to indicate specific points in time, which go with
specific circumstances, or it indicates that the speaker demands attention from the
addressee. Possibly, these two uses are connected in the sense that =bë tells us that
the speaker regards what he says to be relevant for the moment of utterance, but
not in general. However, whether and, if so, how these two uses are related
remains unclear; a definite answer to this question can only be given after
substantial further research.
What can be said, however, is that the form =bë can be found in other words of
the language, like bëbë ‘search’ and bëjta ‘see’, as well as the special attention
demonstrative pronouns bëti and bëna, often used as a sort of presentative (cf.
section 4.4.4). These correlate mainly with the ‘attention’ meaning of bë.7.2.6 =bëla: continuative
The enclitics =bëla and =naja are phasal enclitic particles. Phasal particles express
‘that a state does or does not continue, or that is has or has not come into
existence’ (Van der Auwera 1998:24). The enclitic =bëla indicates that a certain state256Propositional markersof affairs continues to be true or, when attached to a negative clause, that an
expected event still has not been realized. In the first case it can often be translated
with English ‘still’, in the latter case with ‘not yet’. The form =bëla is probably
related to =bë.

‘His brothers had not yet seen him.’
(FA‐6MA‐6)In (65)a and b, there is a declarative sentence marked with the continuative
enclitic, which indicates that the general situation does not change, and the old
one is still valid. In (65)a the situation was and still is that the road has to be built.
It is not finished yet. In (65)b, the speaker is talking about Noah’s journey in his
ark. There is a moment of hope that the water is subsiding, but in the end they
have to continue their journey by boat. In (65)c and d, the negation of the clause
changes the interpretation of =bëla from ‘still’ to ‘not yet’, or ‘still not’. In (65)c,
Noah’s parrot says to him that he can still see no trees coming out of the water,
indicating that the water has subsided. In (65)d the topical participant of the story,
Tiri, has been hidden to escape from the view of his dangerous step‐brothers. At
this point in the story his brothers have not discovered him yet, but they will
shortly.
As can be seen in the examples, =bëla does not always attach to the clause final
element. It is rather free in its placement.7.2.7 =naja: discontinuative
The enclitic =naja, like =bëla is a phasal particle. However, whereas =bëla indicates
that a certain situation is continuing, =naja indicates that a new situation has
arisen, ending the previous state of affairs. It can often be translated with English
‘already’.","[261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272]"

which the speaker mixes up the main characters of the story and then finds out
about her mistake. She then continues to set things straight by explicitly stating
the roles that the main characters have. The subjects of (22)d‐f are pre‐verbal and
in contrastive focus.
In general, then, we can say that VS is the pragmatically more neutral order;
preposing a subject gives some kind of emphasis to it. The fact that the pre‐verbal
position is pragmatically marked is corroborated by the fact that question words
are always sentence‐initial, regardless of their semantic or syntactic role (more
discussion on questions in the next section):

Typological research in the past decades has revealed some rather strong
correlations between sentence word order and the order of words in other
constructions. In Table 50 I give Greenberg’s (1963) list, taken from Payne

creatures that he encountered during his wandering, so that the Yurakaré would

marked topic, with a deictic function, referring back to the topic of the previous
sentence.
In the following fragment, the object is emphasized (stressed) and fronted in the
final sentence of the example:282The clause(25) F

objects can also refer to new and unpredictable information, but objects with extra
emphasis (focus), whether direct or applied, are found in preverbal position. The
fact that applied objects have a slight preference for being postverbal can be
explained by the fact that they are usually very topical (cf. Van Gijn 2005).
The emphatic function of the preverbal position can also be seen in examples
such as the following, where the object NP is discontinuous (cf. section 4.1), the
modifier being in preverbal position, while the head noun is in postverbal
position:
(26) lëshie=w ma‐bëjta‐y
shunñe=w
two=PL
3PL‐see‐1SG.S man=PL
‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]This construction gives emphasis to the quantifier, while the head noun is
presented as a specification, or afterthought, possibly but not necessarily after a
pause. The quantifier is also stressed.
Not very often both object and subject are overtly expressed. In the instances
where this was the case, I have encountered four word orders in texts:283A grammar of Yurakaré(27) abcdtostosma‐che‐ø=ya na

‘Aysa was looking for sabalo.’ (OR‐19MA‐11)I have found no instances of SOV or OSV. The reason that these are rare seems to
be connected to the tendency in the Yurakaré main clause for the verb to be
preceded by only one constituent. In analyzing the first 85 clauses of a text, I have
encountered only three instances where the verb was not in second or first place in
the clause. All kinds of constituents can precede the verb. In (27)a two ideophonic
particles precede the verb; in (27)b and c, two elements precede the verb. Consider
(28), where some other elements that can precede the verb are given:

circumstances, the first element is always a kind of setting marker, like latijsha
‘then’ pënchi ‘later’ ati ‘there’. These are elements that have a scope which is on the
level of the proposition. Subordinated clauses are also often in this position, often,
like setting words (adverbial elements setting the stage for a main event), marked
by an intonation break:

different internal word‐order, generally. Overtly expressed arguments mostly
precede the predicate in these types of clauses:

‘Then Tiri felt sorry for the old agouti when he saw her.’ (AR‐8MI‐47)Leaving aside subordinated clauses, the data suggest that Yurakaré main clause
structure is V‐initial, with two positions before the verb, one position for setting
words, followed by an emphasis position, then followed by the verb. If we look at
how the elements after the verb are ordered, there is not a clear pattern, but
generally the most topical, known information is found rightmost. Adverbs and
adjuncts can intervene; adverbs related to the event are generally adjacent to the
verb, either to the left or to the right (cf. section 6.5.9 above). The following is a
continuous text fragment from the beginning of a text:285A grammar of Yurakaré(33) abcdetütü‐ø=ya

‘He carried with him a very small basket, this Pëpësu.’ (AY‐3NC‐6)Clause (33)a of the fragment is an existential‐presentative construction. The
subject, as expected, is in postverbal position. The adverb shinama generally
appears right after the verb. In (33)b the main new information in the form of an
adjunct is postverbal. The same adjunct in (33)c is the final element and old
information. The new information is the combination pëpëshamaw lacha, which
comes before the old information. In (33)d, the subordinate clause is preposed,
followed by a setting‐word latijsha and a preverbal subject with an extra emphasis
marker =ja introduces a new topic. In (33)e, finally, the emphasized element
anajalima is taken out of the object NP and positioned in the preverbal position.
The new object awerta comes right after the predicate, while the old information na
pëpësu is the final element. The template of the main clause, then, roughly looks as
in (34). Note that these are not absolute positions, but rather tendencies in the
clause.

Negative clauses are marked by the negative adverb nish, with phonetic variant nij
(to negate a predicate or VP) or by the form nij‐ta (NEG‐MID; existential negation).
Nish/nij normally immediately precedes the predicate it negates:Aysa and Pëpësu are two characters that are closely connected in this story in which they
work together. The reason the narrator started the story with Aysa is probably because I
asked him to tell the story of Aysa.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301]"
"6.4.1 Degree: high, medial and low
As has been discussed in 3.3.2 and 4.5, intensity on adjectives is indicated by prefixing
the first one or two syllables of the stem, followed by j (/h/); for morphophonological
details, cf. section 3.2.3. When this morphological process is applied to verbs, the
semantic effect is comparable: it marks high degree and/or much intensity.

superlative meaning to the predicate: ‘what do you fear to the highest degree, most

intensifying prefix; it serves here to emphasize the predicate, to indicate that the event
is at its most intense.

‘The water had subsided a little.’ (OR‐20MA‐2)204The verb phraseThe diminutive marker on a predicate is, as in (61)a, a copy of the characteristics of the
subject marked by the diminutive marker on the noun, i.e. the fact that it is small or
that it evokes mollification. It can also mean, as in (61)b, small degree; i.e. in (61)b, the
fact that the predicate is marked with the diminutive does not mean that the water is
small, but rather that it has subsided only a little.","[218, 219, 220]"
"1267A grammar of YurakaréPredicates with a valence of one can be divided into intransitive verbs and non‐
verbal predicates. These two categories are not formally distinct. Still, I consider
them to be separate categories, since with regard to non‐verbal predications, it is
often difficult to say what is the word order exactly, VS or SV. This is because it is
not always clear which of the two elements is the predicate and which the
argument, hence the high percentage of unanalyzable non‐verbal predicates in
Table 45. As Payne (1997:83) says: “(…) the probability of mistakenly including
predicate nominals in a study of constituent order is quite high (especially if the
language uses a zero copula element in predicate nominals).” Predicates with a
valency of two can be divided into inherently transitive and derived transitive
predicates, or extended intransitives. It is useful to distinguish these two, since, as
will become apparent below, they behave differently in some respects.
In the remainder of this section I will discuss the types of predicates mentioned
in Table 45: intransitive verbs (8.1.1), transitive verbs (8.1.3), extended intransitive
verbs (8.1.4), ditransitive verbs (8.1.5), and non‐verbal predicates (8.1.2). In 8.1.6, I
will discuss word order from an overall perspective; in 8.1.7, finally I will briefly
discuss interrogative and negative sentences.","[282, 283]"

suffix, since the meaning does not follow transparently from adding up the parts.
In some circumstances there is no element of free will with the desiderative:

non‐first persons. It expresses a desire on the part of the speaker in the form of a
command, a wish or an incentive for the proposition to be realized. The marker
precedes the person markers:200The verb phrase(50) abcdula‐cha‐p

distribution with ‐ni ‘intentional’ (this section), which is used for first person singular

Finally, there is a system of imperatives. Imperative marking distinguishes singular
and plural, and polarity (in the sense that there is a separate prohibitive form). Positive
imperative singular is indicated either by the suffix ‐ma, or by the prefix m‐/n‐:Other markers that imply irrealis mode can also be marked on the subordinate clause, cf.

and some prefixes, notably the first person object, cf. (55)c and d, and delimitative li‐,
cf. (55)e. Note that pi‐ does precede third and second persons, cf. (55)a and b.
Finally, there is the prohibitive ‐yu:

"3.3.6 Interjections
There is a small class of interjections, a group of words which are also
phonologically deviant, often consisting of one syllable and ending in consonants
that are normally disallowed. Interjections take no morphology, and appear
sentence initially (optionally preceded by an adverbial element that has scope over
the entire clause). They express the attitude of the speaker. A sample of these
particles is given in Table 18:

‘They are drunk already.’(AR‐8MI‐61)In (66)a, =naja indicates that a new situation has arisen, namely a situation in
which the field is ready; in (66)b, the two main characters of the story are trying to
get a couple of birds drunk. It takes a long time for them to get drunk, but finally
they reach the point where a new situation arises when they are finally drunk. The
term ‘discontinuative’ is used broadly here, and is mainly chosen to contrast it
with the continuative =bëla. In the examples it is explicitly not the case that the
situation of the field being finished is discontinued, or that the situation of being
drunk is being discontinued, rather the opposite. What it does is that it indicates
the new situation that has arisen comes in the place of another, previously existing
situation.
When =naja appears on a negated sentence, it is interpreted as ‘no longer’, ‘not
…anymore’:

us a little later that they do not have their faith anymore, because strange (white?)
people came to visit his ancestors. In (67)c, finally, Tiri’s children grow up, and
they turn out to be very naughty, disobedient children, so Tiri does not like them
anymore.
In the above examples =naja, at least in the positive sentences, is attached to the
predicate that expresses the event that is responsible for ending a previous state of
affairs. However, when =naja is found on questions this does not need to be the
case:258Propositional markers(68) abtëtë‐pshë

"147A grammar of YurakaréThe entities referred to by the cross‐reference affixes in (1) may additionally be
expressed by overt noun phrases, but this is not required. The utterances in (1) are
perfectly grammatical sentences. Polysynthesis in the strong sense (termed
incorporating in Comrie 1989a) does not apply to Yurakaré. The language does
not allow noun incorporation into a verb, and nominal compounding, although it
occurs (cf. section 3.2.4), is not a very frequent process.
Another way to characterize the morphology of a language is head‐marking
versus dependent‐marking, proposed as a typological parameter by Nichols
(1986). Yurakaré has characteristics of both types, although the language is
basically head marking. Possessive relations are head marked, cf. example (2), as
are core grammatical relations subject and direct object, and applied objects, cf.

Gijn 2005).
The noun yarru (which loses its geminate consonant when it carries the possessive
prefixes) is inherently plural, cf. section 4.2.","[62, 63]"
"245A grammar of Yurakaré7.1.7 =pu: visual presentative
The enclitic =pu is used when the speaker has something to show to the hearer. It
is an invitation to the hearer to ‘see for himself’. I have found only one occurrence,
but Day (1980) mentions some other examples:
(31) abotto=ya

DEM=LOC 2PL‐IO‐read‐INTL:1SG.S=VP
‘I’ll read this to you so you’ll see.’ [DAY‐1980‐32]7.2 Clausal enclitics
Clausal markers are not restricted to verbs as their host. They normally attach to
the final element of a clause, irrespective of its lexical category. As we will see, it is
possible for these elements to appear on non‐final elements, but they do differ
from the verbal enclitics in that they are less selective as to their host.7.2.1 =la: validational
Validationality tells us something about how commited the speaker is to the
content of the proposition, cf. Weber’s (1989: 421‐424) analysis of Huallaga
Quechua. The validational marker in Yurakaré tells us nothing about the actual
factuality of the proposition; it can even be found, as we will see, on propositions
that are known to be non‐factual. Nevertheless, it has something to do with the
likelihood of the event being true according to the speaker, given the
circumstances. Consider first the following sentence:
(32) yokkoshe‐ø
meme=la

ku‐ta‐ø=w=ya

‘“It is true mother, you did not lie to us!”, they said to her.’ (AR‐8MI‐31)Example (32) contains two assessments by the speakers (jaguars in this case), both
marked with the validational enclitic =la. The first assessment is that what their
mother had said (i.e. that she ate a human child) is true, the other – essentially the
same assessment – that she did not lie about it after all. With both assessments, the
enclitic =la is placed on the last element of the phrase it asserts.","[260, 261]"
"7.1 Verbal enclitics
The set of verbal enclitics indicate different types of epistemic modality; they tell
us something about how the speaker judges the truth value of the utterance. They
are often not mutually exclusive; rather they co‐occur, and do not denote different
points on a truth‐value scale.7.1.1 =ya: non‐veridical
The marker =ya is the most frequently used propositional marker in narratives,
occurring virtually in every sentence. It has several functions, all revolving around
uncertainty of the speaker of the truth value of his utterance. It is not complete
uncertainty, however. When the speaker uses this marker, he usually has some
reason for assuming the proposition to be true. I use the term ‘non‐veridical’ in
this sense, i.e. the speaker makes a statement that may, but not necessarily does,
describe a realis situation. I will describe all functions of =ya that I have found so
far.
The first function to discuss is that of reportative. Many statements in narratives,
especially in mythological texts, are marked with the enclitic =ya. Consider the
following sequence of events, in which a woman is hiding in the attic of a house of
Puydaras (jaguar‐like creatures), who suspect that there is someone in the attic:232Propositional markers(2)abcdlatijsha yutchi

‘“Rü” he threw the woman out (they say).’ (all: FA‐6MA‐5)In (2), all verbs, except for dandanichi in (2)a and dandaja in (2)c are marked with
the non‐veridical marker. Dandanichi is direct speech, where this marker is usually
not found, and dandaja has the same‐subject marker =ja, which is incompatible
with =ya, as is the different‐subject marker =ti. Verbs marked with the hypothetical
marker are often translated with ‘they say that’. This can be linked to ‘non‐
veridical’ in the sense that all events talked about in a narrative exist in a fictitious
world of words only, and so they are essentially hypothetically, and not
necessarily true.
Apart from its hearsay function, which is evidential in nature, =ya has other
functions, which are more in the realm of epistemic modality. Consider first the
following examples:

protagonist tries to convince his friends that they all should help him build an ark,
because the water will come and devastate everything. Since his friends don’t
believe him, they deduct that Noah is probably lying, that he has gone mad.
Example (3)b is taken from a text about the wrath of a mythological figure, ayma233A grammar of Yurakaréshunñe (fire man), who burnt everything to the ground. Two people manage to
save themselves. He tells them to go and procreate. If they don’t do that, he
promises that he will come back and burn everything again. This time no one will
be saved. In (3)c, another mythological figure, Tiri (founder of the Yurakaré) has
made a field for his stepmother, but she deems it too small, assuming that it will
not be big enough to feed the both of them. In (3)d, finally, taken from a dialogue,
the speaker is looking at the mini‐disk recorder and sees movement in the display.
From this he deducts that it must be working.
The examples in (3) cannot be translated with ‘reportative’ since they are not
dealing with hearsay information. Instead, they are assuming or hypothesizing
something to be true on the basis of some expectation they have. In this sense =ya
has a wider, and more epistemic function than just reportative.
There are two further environments where =ya is found. In both of these it
stands in opposition with the same‐subject marker =ja. The first is:

‘When we go, maybe we will die.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)In each of these examples, we are dealing with two propositions that are
grammatically and conceptually integrated. The first predicate, which I consider
to be subordinate, or co‐subordinate, does not carry any subject marker or TMA
markers; instead it carries the marker =ya. The second predicate is a full‐fledged
verb, with subject markers and TMA markers. Constructions may be marked in
this way under two conditions: the subjects of the subordinate and main clause
should be identical, and the main verb should denote a non‐specific, non asserted
event. This means that the main verb in these constructions is typically marked for
habitual, jussive, imperative, future, intentional, etc. In (4)a, the main verb is not
morphologically marked for habitual, but it is modified with the adverb chajtiya,
which implies habituality. In (4)b, the main verb is marked for jussive, in (4)c for234Propositional markersimperative, and in (4)d, finally, the main verb is marked for future tense. A more
detailed account of these constructions is given in section 8.2.2 below.
This use of =ya can be contrasted with the same‐subject marker =ja in similar
constructions. A predicate marked with =ja is normally encoded as having taken
place, a realis event, whereas the use of =ya in constructions such as (4) refers to an
irrealis event.

future‐tense marker ‐shta. It refers to the moment before bathing. More on this and
related constructions can be found in section 8.2.3. A final construction involving
=ya is of the following type:

‘When they arrive, do not fall in love with them.’(AR‐8MI‐21)In the same circumstances as the subordinate =ya clauses, i.e. when we are not
dealing with a specific or factual event, speakers often repeat the predicate, strip it
of its subject marking and TMA morphology, and mark it with =ya. The effect of
this repetition is that it gives a certain emphasis to the proposition. The type of
emphasis added can be diverse. In (6)a, the repetition of mala + ya marks a certain
impatience on the part of the speaker and coercion to carry out the request. The
second =ya is simply the narrative =ya treated above. The utterance is made at a235A grammar of Yurakarévery dramatic moment in the story in which a man tells his wife that he is
ashamed of his face that has been damaged. He says that she must go her own
way and leave him. The effect of the repetition in (6)b is similar to that of (6)a, only
not so much coercive, but more anxious and longing. This is from the story of
Noah, where they have been on the ark for a long time, waiting for the trees to
come out of the water, which would indicate that the water is subsiding. In (6)c
and (6)d, the emphasis marks urgency and extra warning for potentially
dangerous situations.
Other kinds of emphasis that can be indicated by repetition include despair (7)a,
astonishment (7)b, reassurance (7)c, and gravity of the situation or possibly
alerting of the hearer (7)d. Note that in the repetition of (7)d, the negation is left
out as well.

have to indicate whether we are dealing with a specific, factual event or with a
non‐specific or non‐factual event. When a specific factual event is repeated, it
takes the marker =ja (cf. section 8.2.3):

event that has taken place or is taking place, or is believed to have taken place. The
kinds of emphasis here are reinforcement of happiness in (8)a, and urgent
demanding, in (8)b and c.7.1.2 =chi: ignorative
The marker =chi 1 is most often found on questions. Questions are generally
marked with =chi when the speaker has no idea what the answer could be, and
s/he is open to any answer.

‘What is that?’ (AY‐3NC‐7)Another area where =chi is often found is with commands:The marker =chi may be related to the evidential/validational marker =chi in Quechua,
which expresses conjecture (Adelaar 1977: 79) or lack of conviction of the factual status of
the proposition (Weber 1989: 422).","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252]"
"239A grammar of YurakaréThe following final example should also be mentioned, since it does not mark
incompletive aspect or a frustrative meaning. This may have to do with the fact
that the event is marked for habitual aspect rather than future tense:

‘He could speak our language well (so they say).’ (AR‐8MI‐87)Here, the speaker is talking about a visit that angel‐like creatures 2 made to his
ancestors. They just appeared at a certain point, and just like that they could speak
Yurakaré. The ignorative marker here possibly relates to the fact that the speaker
has no idea where these people got this skill. However, the use of the ignorative
here is not very clear.7.1.3 =laba: subjective
The meaning of the enclitic =laba is not very clear. It seems to mark a certain
subjectivity on the part of the speaker, which does not necessarily corresponds
with the facts. The marker =laba occurs in a number of different environments.
Firstly, the marker is often found in combination with the adverb benebene‐sh
‘lamentably’.

‘How sad that you have arrived like this.’ (OR‐20MA‐10)These people are said to be completely white, even transparent. They also had healing
skills and, as becomes apparent from the example, could speak Yurakaré. Possibly this is a
mythologized version of very early visits of white people.
3 The repetition of the predicate here is of the same type as discussed above in examples
(6)‐(8), only without either the marker =ya or =ja. This may have to do with the fact that
predicates marked with =laba are often neither realis nor irrealis, they are personal
evaluations of events.
2240Propositional markersAccording to Day (1980) the suffix =laba also co‐occurs with adverbs of happiness,
pleasure:

3PL‐go.out‐3=SBJ

tree
‘Possibly the trees have come out.’ (OR‐20MA‐2)What the examples in (18)‐(20) seem to have in common is some sort of notion like
‘subjectivity’, if we assume the marker =laba to have scope over both the verb and
the adverb in (18) and (19). The subjective marker expresses the fact that the
proposition is not so much factual, but holds in the subjective mind of the speaker.
Another use of =laba is illustrated in the following examples:
(21) abmala‐ø=ya=laba

meaning associated with =chi, as was discussed above. It is at this point not very
clear what the difference is between the examples in (21) and the ones in (15).
The function of =laba in (22), again, is rather unclear:241A grammar of Yurakaré(22) abti‐apta=w

‘How can you believe that you are with your family?’ (AR‐8MI‐48)Examples (22)a and b are from the same story, but told by different narrators. At
the point in the respective narratives of these two examples, two agoutis are trying
to convince Tiri that, even though he thinks that he lives with his real family, he
actually lives with stepfamily, who are his enemy. It seems that =laba in (22)a and
b, indicates a presumption on the part of the agoutis. Note the combination with
the ignorative marker =chi and the repetition of the verb ta ‘say’, in (22)a with the
non‐veridical marker =ya, and in (22)b with the same subject marker =ja. I will
come back to combinatory possibilities of modal enclitics in 7.3.
The combination =chi=laba can also express doubt of a proposition earlier
believed to be true, or information supposed to be true:
(23) abyokkoshe bobo‐m=chi=laba

‘Is it true that it would hurt me?’ (AR‐8MI‐83)The example in (23)a is uttered by Puydaras (jaguar‐like creatures) who had been
convinced that their mother had killed and eaten a human child. Now they have
reason to doubt this. In (23)b, Tiri has created a stingray using his magic, and with
the assumption that it could hurt when it stings, he now wants to test whether it
would really hurt him.
Finally, the enclitic =laba is sometimes used when the speaker suddenly realizes
something:The fact that the repetition in (22)a occurs with the non‐veridical marker =ya (cf. footnote
3 of this chapter), whereas in (22)b it occurs with =ja may have to do with the fact that the
predicate of (22)a is additionally marked with the habitual marker ‐jti (cf. section 7.1.1).
5 The ignorative marker =chi, like the directional marker =chi, has an allomorph =yj.

(24)b, the speaker has been suspecting his mother of doing things in secret, so he
decides to spy on her. Then he understands what it is she has been doing secretly
all this time (having an affair with the sun).
Taking all the examples with =laba into consideration there is at this point no
clear answer to the question what the exact meaning is of =laba. It refers to
presupposition, counterfactuality, doubt, subjectivity, evaluation. I consider
subjectivity to be the central notion, especially since it is congruent with the fact
that translations in elicitation tasks were often marked with =laba, especially with
less confident speakers, indicating the opinion and doubt of the consultant.
Nevertheless, further research is needed to obtain a better understanding of this
enclitic.7.1.4 =tiba: assumptive
The enclitic =tiba is not used very often. It expresses doubt on the part of the
speaker. Formally, it seems related to =laba. There may be a separate morpheme
=ba, but the evidence is too thin to draw any firm conclusions. The enclitic =tiba is
often translated with ‘I think’.

‘I suppose he was really hungry.’(OR‐19MA‐9)In these examples, the evidence for the truth values of these assertions is indirect.
In (25)a, the main character Tiri is trying to kill a Puydara with his arrow, but
somehow this Puydara notices this in time and manages to escape. The narrator243A grammar of Yurakaréassumes that the animal noticed Tiri because Puydaras are generally known to
have had eyes in the back of their head. Note that on the final word there is an
element =ti as well, which may be an indication that the element =ti in =tiba has a
separate meaning. The element =ye will be discussed in 7.2.3 below. In (25)b, the
odd behaviour of Noah (telling everyone that it is going to rain heavily and that
all will be destroyed) leads the speaker of this utterance to his conclusion. In (25)c,
finally, the narrator assumes that one of the characters of the story must have been
really hungry, because he ate peleltas, a type of fruit normally only eaten by
monkeys.7.1.5 =bala: admonitive
The enclitic =bala occurs even less frequently than =tiba. It is normally found on
verbs that express some kind of warning (cf. Day 1980‐32). I have heard only one
example of this:
(26) mi‐munë‐shta‐ø=bala sasta
2SG‐prick‐FUT‐3=ADM sugarcane
‘The sugarcane will sting you! (watch out)’ (FA‐PC)This utterance was made when the consultant and I were doing translation work.
While we were working she saw her grandson playing with the sugarcanes, so she
warned him to watch out for the spines of the sugarcane.
The suffix =bala is also discussed in Day (1980), exclusively with the
admonishing function:
(27) abdanda‐yu
dele‐shta‐m=bala
go.up‐PROH fall.SG‐FUT‐2SG.S=ADM
‘Don’t climb up, you might fall.’ [DAY‐1980‐32]
kayashi‐shta‐m=bala
shoot‐FUT‐2SG.S=ADM
‘(Quit aiming at those chickens) you might hit one.’ [DAY‐1980‐32]As mentioned above, it may be possible to isolate the element =ba as having a
meaning of its own. If we would do that, the enclitics =laba and =bala would both
be combinations of the validational marker =la (cf. section 7.2.1 below) and =ba.
The order would then reflect scope, =laba meaning ‘I think that really X’ and =bala
‘I really think that X’. So in example (26) the translation would be ‘I really think
that the sugarcane will prick you’ and in example (20), repeated here, the
translation would be ‘I think that the trees really have come out.’244Propositional markers(28) ma‐otto‐ø=laba
otto
kummë
3PL‐go.out‐3=SBJ
go.out tree
‘Possibly the trees have come out.’ (OR‐20MA‐2)In this reading the element =ti of =ti=ba would mean something like deduction, or
an evidential suffix indicating that the evidence for the assertion comes from
context. Again, further research is needed to investigate this possibility further.7.1.6 =jtë: speculative
The marker =jtë marks speculation on the part of the speaker. It is mostly
combined with gender‐based clause final markers =ri (men) or =yu (women). I will
come back to these below in section 7.2.2. The enclitic =jtë in declarative clauses
indicates that the speaker is making a guess or estimation, without having any
evidence for it:
(29) la=mapa=kka ati‐kka=jtë
latiji=la=yu
SEQ=tall=MEA DEM‐MEA=SPC
subsequently=VAL=EXPR.F
‘He was tall then, he will have been about this size, I guess.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)This enclitic is mostly found in interrogative clauses. It has the effect that it turns
the question into an expressive one, where the speaker does not expect an answer:
(30) abam=chi

‘I don’t see them, where could they be?’When the enclitic =jtë is used in combination with =ri/=yu in a question, it means
that the speaker has no clue as to the answer of the question, and no answer to the
question is expected. This is generally what =jtë expresses: lack of evidence.","[254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260]"
"296The clauseIn (54)a, the clause combination chitta mala is as a whole subordinate to the verb
timbë. This means that the subject of chitta mala is not indicated on either of these
verbs, but rather it is marked as the direct object of ibëbë. In (54)b, the construction
tëshujuta timbë, which in itself is a clause combination, is superordinate to the
subject clause abëssëyti. The construction with the subordinate marker =ti will be
discussed in section 8.2.4 below. Note that, even though the causee is marked on
the verb timbë in (54)b, it is also marked on the dependent verb, as a cooperative
object. 20 Apparently subject agreement is blocked, but object agreement is not,
even though we are dealing with coreference.
This morphosyntactic type of clause combinations is used when the two events
are inextricably interwoven. States of affairs that are encoded in this way are
manner clauses, like the ones discussed above, where the leftmost, subordinated
verb can be replaced by a manner adverb:
(55) achu
ti‐m‐bë‐ø
like.that
1SG‐IO‐treat‐3
‘Like that he did to me.’These manner verbs can also be path‐movement verbs or location‐manner verbs
combining with a semantically more or less empty movement verb like mala/bali
‘go’ or winani ‘walk’.
Some complement relations can be expressed as VP‐conjunctions.
Complementation can be defined as “the syntactic situation that arises when a
notional sentence or predicate is an argument” (Noonan 1985:42). Normally,
complementation in Yurakaré is marked by the subordinating particle =ti (cf.
section 8.2.4), as in (54)b. Some complement relations, however, can additionally
be represented as follows:
(56) ti‐m‐pëlë

This is due to the semantics of the verb shujuta ‘to sweat’. The experiencer of sweating is
always indicated as a cooperative object.","[311, 312]"
"9A grammar of YurakaréThe noun phrase normally consists of a noun and optionally has modifying
elements as well (possessors, adjectives, numerals, quantifiers and articles).
Numerals, quantifiers and articles precede the noun; adjectives, as exemplified in
example (4) below, and possessors can be on either side of the head noun.
Modifiers can furthermore be extracted from the noun phrase:

‘Much of my blood is pouring out.’ [AA‐9MA‐6]Possession is marked on the head by means of a cross‐referencing personal prefix,
as can be observed in example (2) above. The noun marked for possession is
usually preceded (but it may also be followed) by the possessor noun phrase:
(3)shunñe a‐pojore
man
3SG.P‐canoe
‘the man’s canoe’Number and case relations are marked by means of postpositional enclitics, which
attach to the rightmost element of the noun phrase. The postpositions marking
case relations mark the more peripheral relations: comitative, instrument, location,
direction and ablative. There is also a postpositional enclitic marking an emphatic
subject. All of this is exemplified in (4). Here it can also be observed that the clitic
status of the plural marker is somewhat doubtful, as it can appear optionally and
in addition to marking the final element, on non‐final elements as well.

‘The woman clubs the man with a big broom.’ (GB‐1MI‐99)Yurakaré is an accusative language, with some ergative characteristics, restricted
to a very small number of verbs. Subjects are suffixed to the verb, objects are
prefixed. Yurakaré predicate roots are either intransitive or transitive. These basic
valencies can be extended to maximally three head‐marked arguments with the
help of an elaborated system of five different applicatives (comitative, co‐
operative, objective, indirect object and affected object). Examples of such verb
roots with extended valency are the following:10Introduction(5)abti‐ma‐n‐kaya‐ma
1SG‐3PL‐IO‐give‐IMP.SG
‘Give them to me!’
ti‐ma‐la‐che‐m
1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐2SG.S
‘You ate them from me.’The entities referred to by the cross‐reference affixes in (5) may additionally be
expressed by overt noun phrases, but this is not required. The utterances in (5) are
perfectly grammatical sentences. Yurakaré, in other words, is a pro‐drop
language.
Many temporal, modal and aspectual distinctions are marked by means of
suffixes, which come right after valency changing morphology (the middle voice
marker and causative, which are suffixed), but before the person markers. This
taken together with the object cross‐referencing prefixes and applicative markers
discussed above complete the template of the Yurakaré verb:
(6)object cross ref. ‐ applicatives ‐ root ‐ valency ‐ TMA ‐ subject cross ref.","[24, 25, 26]"
"1.4 Outline of the work and conventions
The present work is organized as follows. In chapter 2 I will give a description of
the phonological system; an introduction to Yurakaré morphology will be given in
chapter 3. Chapter 1 discusses the noun phrase (the noun and its modifiers), while
chapter 5 deals with person marking, voice and valency. The verb phrase (the
verb, adverbs and verbal particles) is the topic of chapter 6, and in chapter 1 I will
outline the verbal and clausal enclitics that function on the propositional level. In
chapter 8, finally, I will discuss both simple and complex clauses.
The following chapters will contain many examples, which have references to
sources in the following way:
(9)tütü‐ø=ya
shinama ati
aysa
sit;be‐3=NVR
before
DEM
Aysa
‘There was this Aysa once.’ (AY‐2NC‐6)18IntroductionThe reference to the source of this sentence is between parentheses. The first item
refers to the consultant, indicated with his initials, the number of the second item
refers to the number I gave to the particular minidisk; the letters refer to the place
where the sentence was recorded (in this case Nueva Canaan); the last item refers
to the track on the minidisk. Within this system of reference I also indicate
whether the data were taken from spontaneous speech (narrative or dialogue) or
whether they were obtained through elicitation. In the former case, the reference
will be between (round brackets) as in (9); in the latter case, the reference will be
between [square brackets]. Unfortunately, I have not been able to record every
elicitation session. Elicited examples that have been written down but not
recorded will be indicated as follows, with the name of the consultant followed by
‘PC’ for personal comment:
(10) patta
yupa‐ø
juan
a‐tewi
thorn
go.in.SG‐3
Juan 3SG.P‐foot:LOC
‘The thorn went into Juan’s foot.’ [FR‐PC]Furthermore I sometimes make use of data mentioned especially in Day (1980).
Unfortunately, this manuscript is unpaged, but it is divided into 40 chapters.
When referring to examples from the work of Day (1980) I will refer to the chapter
numbers in the following manner:
(11) anu‐ta
dula‐shti
like.that‐MID do;make‐FUT:1SG.S
‘Shall I do it like that?’ [DAY‐1980‐14]The number ‘14’ here refers to chapter 14 of Day (1980). Since Day (1980) does not
use glosses, these are mine in all examples that I cite from this work.
As far as the glossing labels are concerned, a list of abbreviations can be found
on page viii at the beginning of the grammar. I furthermore distinguish
typographically between affixing, cliticization and reduplication. In this I follow
the Leipzig Glossing Rules. Affixes are indicated with a single dash (‐), clitics are
marked by the equality sign (=), reduplication, finally, is marked by a tilde (~).
Finally, I make a difference between portmanteau morphemes and morphemes
that are normally separate but that have fused phonologically. In the former case
the two meaning elements are separated by a single dot; in the latter case they are
separated by a colon:
(12) bëjti
see:1SG.S
‘I see it.’19A grammar of YurakaréThe underlying form is bëjta‐y, with a distinguishable suffix indicating first person
singular subject. The fact that this suffix has fused with the root is indicated by a
colon. The suffix ‐y itself refers both to first person and to the fact that it is the
subject of the sentence. These two meanings are separated by a single dot.","[33, 34, 35]"
"71A grammar of Yurakaré3.3 Parts of speech
As is shown in Anward et al. (1997), languages can differ from each other in
several respects when it comes to the inventory of their lexical categories. They
can differ in what kind of categories they identify; the distinction between verbs
and nouns seems to be universal (Schachter 1985:6‐7), though even that is
questioned (cf. Hengeveld 1992:67 for Tuscarora). Adjectives, (manner) adverbs
and smaller parts of speech are not universal at all. Languages can also differ in
terms of the criteria that can be used to distinguish their lexical categories. The
general approach in any language to distinguish lexical categories is that “the
primary, definitional properties of parts of speech are semantic or pragmatic,
rather than form related; (…) semantic or pragmatic features are part‐of‐speech
defining only if there is at least one formal characteristic that correlates with
them” (Anward et al. 1997:172). Formal characteristics can be found on the
syntactic, morphological or phonological level 11. Languages differ as to which of
these formal characteristics correlates with the semantic‐pragmatic features.
These differences, together with the fact that the boundaries between the
different parts of speech are sometimes rather fuzzy (cf. Payne 1997:32), make it a
difficult task to identify the parts of speech of a language. Therefore the
distinctions I have chosen to make, although based on notional, syntactic,
morphological, and sometimes even phonological criteria, do not reflect rigid
classes with clear‐cut boundaries, but rather they reflect tendencies associated
with certain lexical classes.
When these precautions are taken into consideration, we might say that
Yurakaré distinguishes seven lexical classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitic particles. I will discuss each of the parts of
speech in turn, stating their (prototypical) notional, syntactic and morphological
characteristics as well as subclassifications. I will start with nouns (3.3.1), followed
by adjectives (3.3.2), verbs (3.3.3), adverbs (3.3.4), ideophones (3.3.5), interjections
(3.3.6), and finally clitic particles (3.3.7).","[86, 87]"

‘His arrow did not catch fire, subsequently.’ (AY‐2NC‐5)In these examples the clitic na is not used adjectivally, but rather independently,
except for the second occurrence of na in (49)b. In (49)b and c the corresponding
noun phrase follows later, in (49)a, there is no corresponding noun phrase. Note
too, that the clitic form of the demonstrative cannot be marked for plural, as can
be observed in (49)a and c. Furthermore, in (49)c, the clitic seems to attach to the
preceding word instead of the following word. In this specific example, na is
followed by a small pause. These facts make it hard to classify these clitics as
proclitics or enclitics. The clitics an and a(t) are more restricted. They usually only64Morphologyappear in adjectival position, and do not alternate with free forms in other
positions.
Another group of reduced, unstressed clitics are reduced forms of the adverb
latijsha ‘then, after that, when’, which functions as a connector. The forms are lash
and la.

‘Then they went looking.’ (FA‐6MA‐7)These proclitics do not interfere with the word‐stress of their host either. They are
themselves unstressed. They seem to be restricted to clause initial position, but the
full form latijsha (which is sometimes also reduced to lashsha, a reduced form that
still carries stress) also mainly occurs in clause‐initial position.
Some other adverbs also have reduced forms, such as achu ‘like that’ (ash) and
anu ‘like this’ (an), ushta ‘before’ (ush). Examples of ash= are given in (51):

2SG‐markA grammar of YurakaréAs can be seen in the examples, it does not matter whether these reduced
pronouns precede ((52)b and d) or follow ((52)a and c) the predicate or noun they
are cross‐referenced with.
In the examples of the remainder of the grammar, I will not indicate the
proclitics discussed in examples (48)‐(52) by means of the symbol ‘=’. I will in fact
not distinguish these enclitics from separate words in their representation, since
they do not seem to constitute one word with their host as much as the other
clitics do, as we will see. First, they do not form a phonological word with their
host as far as prosody is concerned; second, they seem to be more free positionally
than class II and class III clitics. Class I enclitics differ furthermore from class II
and III clitics in Yurakaré in that whereas the former generally have unreduced
and independent counterparts, the latter two do not.
Before discussing class II clitics, I will first discuss class III clitics. Class III clitics
can be termed phrasal enclitics because they attach to a phrase‐final element. In
the nominal domain, the plural marker and the postpositional markers are
examples of phrasal enclitics:
(53) abmatata ti‐pojore=w
big
1SG‐canoe=PL
‘my big canoes’
inele
elle=y
inside
earth=LOC
‘in the ground’vs.vs.ti‐pojore
matata=w
1SG‐canoe
big=PL
‘my big canoes’
elle
inele=y
earth inside=LOC
‘in the ground’The order of adjectives and nouns can be reversed, as can be seen in (53).
Nevertheless, the plural marker in (53)a as well as the postposition in (53)b remain
where they are: they attach to the rightmost element of the NP. Other nominal
enclitics are =chi ‘directional’, =jsha ‘ablative’, =la ‘instrumental’, =tina ‘comitative’
and =ja ‘subject emphasis marker’. I will discuss all of these in sections 4.2 and 4.3
below.
NPs can be discontinuous in Yurakaré (cf. section 4.1). The head of the NP in
these circumstances is postverbal, while its modifier is in preverbal, focus position.
In these cases, the postpositions are still attached to the (rightmost) head noun,
while the preposed modifier does not have any postpositional marking:
(54) abdanda‐shti
kummë matata=la
go.up‐FUT.1SG.S tree
big=INS
‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]
matata danda‐shti
kummë=la
big
go.up‐FUT.1SG.S
tree=INS
‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]66MorphologyPlural markers behave a little differently. When a plural NP is discontinuous,
usually both the modifier and the head noun are marked for plural:
(55) lëshie=w ma‐bëjti
shunñe=w
two=PL 3PL‐see:1SG.S man=PL
‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]Plural markers are generally found more often on both the head noun and the
modifier, even if the NP is not discontinuous, and especially with the order noun‐
adjective. Postpositional enclitics are never found on both elements.
There are also a few clausal clitics that mostly attach to the clause‐final element.
These are modal and aspectual particles. Examples are =la ‘validational’, =bë
‘momentaneous’, =se ‘repetition (among other meanings)’ and =bëla (continuative).
They normally attach to the rightmost element of the clause, and are associated
semantically with the propositional level (cf. chapter 1):

is attached to the object of the verb, and in (56)c, the enclitic =se attaches to the
subject. The enclitic =bëla in (56)d, finally, is attached to the subject. These enclitics
can also attach to other parts of speech:
(57) abctiya‐y=la

adverb. In other words: these syntactic enclitics can attach to different hosts when
they are the last element of the clause. Occasionally, an element that pertains to
the clause comes after the clausal enclitic:
(58) abmala‐ø=la

they belong to. This is especially clear with the enclitic =bëla ‘continuative’ in the
following example:

according to the gender of the speaker: =ri/=ra for men and =yu/=ye for women:

can, however, be followed by a lexical element in a compound. In (61), the stem
mujumuju carries the locative postposition =y, which in turn is followed by the
compounded noun bëshë ‘thing, entity’.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"
"182The verb phraseWith regard to the first question, there are some circumstances in which there is future
time reference without the use of the marker ‐shta:

3PL.CO‐be.busy‐1PL.S bee=PL
‘When our daughter arrives she will wash, while we occupy ourselves with the bees.’
(FL‐14MA‐1)Here the event of ‘occupying ourselves with the bees’ has future time reference, but no
future marker. This may be due, however to the borrowed co‐temporal marker mentere
‘meanwhile’ (< Sp. mientras). Apart from examples such as these, the use of the marker
‐shta for future time reference is quite meticulous, i.e. there are not many examples of
future time reference without ‐shta.
Nevertheless, with reference to the second question, since ‐shta marks relative tense,
and since it can be combined with modal particles, there are quite a number of
examples where ‐shta is used without there being future time reference in the purest
sense:

‘Would it be true that it would hurt me?’ (AR‐8MI‐83)In (5)a‐d the events marked with ‐shta refer to a non‐actualized, irrealis situation. In all
of the examples, the future marker is combined with the ignorative marker =chi (or its
allomorph =yj) which indicates that the narrator cannot be sure whether the predicted
event would have actually taken place had the circumstances been more favorable. I
still maintain a future tense analysis here, since, from the vantage point of the moment
in the narrative, the irrealis event did have a future time reference. In the examples
(5)a‐c, however, something unexpected happened to prevent the normal, expected
developments from taking place. In (5)d, there is no intervening event, but the speaker183A grammar of Yurakaréwants to find out whether his personal conviction, marked with =laba is true, namely
that a stingray would hurt him. Therefore he is going to test this. The future marker
here refers to the expected future time event where the speaker gets hurt by the
stingray. The point here is that we can maintain the future time reference analysis, and
that the modal interpretations are due to the modal enclitics. These enclitics will be
discussed in chapter 1.
The future marker is not required for counterfactual constructions:

1SG‐foodHere, there is no future tense marker, but the counterfactual reading is still there.
Apparently this reading is not dependent on the future marker. Rather, the future
marker in examples (5)a‐c indicates that at the time of the reference point one could
make a prediction that would hold at a later moment.
Predicates not marked for tense can be interpreted either as past or as present. They
depend on their context and on aspectual (cf. 6.2) and modal (cf. 6.3) markers for their
temporal interpretation:

from; both clauses are unmarked for tense. Still (7)a is interpreted as present tense,
while (7)b is interpreted as past tense. The only reason for this is the situational context,
and knowledge of the world. The hearer knows that the addressee Aysa is in a tree,
while the speaker, Pëpësu is on the ground, which permits the present tense reading of
(7)a, while it forces the past tense reading of (7)b.","[197, 198, 199]"

shared by the two verbs chitta and mala, i.e. the combination of verbs is marked for
subordination, not just one of them. In (45)b we can see that the two verbs share
the jussive marker ‐cha, which is the modality for the combination of verbs, but
only marked on the second verb. The cross reference + applicative prefixes ti‐n‐ in
This verb has a suppletive stem which changes according to the number of objects (cf.

verbs of this type can be marked for object agreement, but not for subject
agreement. This latter point can be seen in (45)c, where the subject agreement
marker ‐y for first person singular is only found on the rightmost verb; the
examples in (45)a‐b seem to have the following structure.
(46) [[chitta]vp[mala]vp subject]sThe examples in (45) denote two highly integrated events that share subject and
TMA. In (45)c, the fact that we can have another verb than mala/bali ‘to go’ shows
that we are not dealing with a frozen expression. The construction in (45) looks
most like a serial verb construction, cf. Sebba 1987: 86‐87, who mentions shared
subject, TMA, polarity, as well as simultaneity or consecutivity of the two events
as generally accepted characteristics of serial verb constructions.
Simultaneous action can also be indicated with a serial verb construction,
though this is less common, and the examples are not very clear:

‘While talking we crossed the river to the other side.’[FA‐24MA‐16]Syntactically, (47)a and c are difficult to distinguish from coordinate clauses
without overt marking (cf. 8.2.5), since there is no overt person or TMA inflection.
They can be distinguished by the fact that they are pronounced within a single
intonation phrase. In (47)b, there is overt person marking. Here we see that the
subject is indeed shared: igora ‘have, carry, wear a cap’ would have person
marking in other circumstances, but here it does not since it shares the subject
with mala ‘go’. I have found only instances of this particular construction where
the rightmost members are movement verbs.
The rightmost verb in these constructions takes its own object marking:The verb dyërërë has deviant person marking; the person conversing is indicated as an
indirect object. Apparently, it still has to be expressed since it is not a subject syntactically,
cf also the constructions discussed below in this section.","[307, 308]"
"1.2.3 Typological sketch
The basis of Yurakaré phonology is relatively simple. Yurakaré has 18 phonemic
consonants, distinguishing five places and five manners of articulation. There are
voiced counterparts for three of the plosives, as is exemplified in Table 1 below. As
far as vowels are concerned, Yurakaré has a total of seven phonemic vowels. They
are given in Table 2.plosives

uSyllable structure is (C)V(C), with a number of restrictions on which consonants
can be in the coda (cf. section 2.3.1). Morphophonological processes include
lenition (restricted to /k/), assimilation (mostly of consonants), elision (mostly
vowels), and gemination (both vowels and consonants). Stress assignment is more
complex. Yurakaré feet are iambic, counted from left to right; primary stress is
assigned to the rightmost dominant node and the final syllable is extrametrical.
However, there are affixes that bear their own prosodic information. Some affixes
attract (secondary or primary) stress, while yet others avoid being stressed. I call
the former stress‐attracting and the latter stress‐avoiding morphemes. Apart from
these two types of affixes, there are also prosodically neutral affixes and
diacritically marked roots.
Morphologically, Yurakaré can be characterized as an agglutinating language on
the scale of fusion, and fairly polysynthetic on the synthesis index.
(1)ti‐ma‐y‐mala‐m=chi
ku‐ta‐ø=ya
1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG=IGN 3SG.CO‐say‐3=NVR
‘Go and get them for me, she said to him.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)Verbs are usually morphologically complex, without much fusion. This can be
observed in example (1), where three participants are marked on the verb (ti‐ for
first person singular, ma‐ for third person plural object, and ‐m for second person
singular subject, as well as an applicative marker y‐ specifying the role of the third
person plural object (purposive). The ignorative marker is cliticized onto the verb.
The fact that this utterance in itself is a grammatically correct and complete
sentence illustrates the polysynthetic character of the morphology. There is no
incorporation of lexical items, however. Morpheme boundaries are generally
easily separable in Yurakaré and there is often a one‐form‐one‐meaning
correspondence. There is some fusion, however. As can be seen in example (1),
there is fusion of the categories person and number in cross‐referencing affixes,
and sometimes there is also fusion of grammatical relation markers with person
and number, as is the case with ku‐ in kutaya. In the case of the imperative there is
fusion of ‘imperative’ and number.
Yurakaré distinguishes seven wordclasses: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitics. The last three may possibly be subsumed
under the higher‐level category of particles.","[23, 24]"
"2.4.7 Discourse‐based stress
Stress can be used for pragmatic purposes. This is especially important for deictic
words. I have found differences such as the following:
(75) unmarked
latíjsha
achúta
anúta
achàmatíjsha~ marked
~ látijsha
~ áchu(ta)
~ ánu(ta)
~ àchamátijshagloss
‘after that’
‘in that way’
‘in this way’
‘in spite of that’These stress differences are caused by pragmatic highlighting, just as in English
you can say: ‘after THAT’ and ‘AFter that’.
Stress as a pragmatic device is not grammaticalized, i.e. obligatory, but it may
very well be that the heavy prefix‐rule (cf .2.4.2) was originally a pragmatically
driven stress rule
Sentence intonation can also marginally influence stress‐placement. Medial
clauses form an intonational phrase, and they are characterized by a higher pitch
at the penultimate syllable, which is maintained at the final syllable. Higher pitch
often coincides with stress in Yurakaré. This can override all other prosodic
constraints:45A grammar of Yurakaré(76) absetá‐ø=w=ya

‘When he came out, he spoke with him.’ (FA‐6MA‐5)Lëjëlë is a word with a diacritically marked first syllable, and so the expected stress
pattern would be lë$jëlë@shtati. This is overruled by intonational pitch and stress,
which can cause stress to fall on the penultimate syllable of the intonation phrase.
In the case of ottoja, the first syllable is heavy and so we would expect the stress
pattern to be óttoja. But, again, this is overruled by intonational stress.
In some cases, intonational stress can fall on the last syllable of the intonation
phrase.

"1.3 Fieldwork
1.3.1 Fieldwork situation and methodology
The present work is based almost entirely on fieldwork data. I collected data in
two main areas and in four different communities:year

1,5 monthIn 2001 I spent three months in La Misión on the border of the Chapare and
Carrasco provinces in the department of Cochabamba (cf. Map 2). Of those three
months I was able to conduct fieldwork for only two months, because of political
problems. Politically, La Misión falls under the administration of the Territorio
Indígena Coni‐Yura, a body run by indigenous inhabitants of the area, and I
needed permission from them. Since it took them rather long to answer my
request, the people of La Misión in a village meeting decided to make a
preliminary decision to help me with my research. At the end of my stay in 2001 I
still did not have an answer from the authorities. The answer finally came after a
month in La Misión in 2002, and it was negative, without any reason given.
This meant that I had to go to another area, so I traveled to Trinidad where I met
Julio Ribera, who works with the Yurakaré Indians living in the Beni department.
He introduced me to the president and vice‐president of the subcentral (the local
indigenous administration) of the area, which comprises the uppermost part of the
Isiboro River as well as a part of the Mamoré River. This time the permission was
given swiftly and gladly, so I started working here, on the condition that I would12Introductionwork in several villages of the area and that I would deliver a dictionary. The first
condition had as a result that I worked in three villages in the area: Tacuaral,
Nueva Canaan (both in 2002) and Loma del Masí (in 2003 and 2004); the second
condition will result in the publication of a dictionary (Van Gijn & Hirtzel, in
prep).
During these four periods of fieldwork, I collected a number of texts, most of
which are mythological tales. These are stories that have been told for generations,
and they are also shared – with some modifications – by Yurakaré Indians in
different parts of their area of dispersion (cf. Hirtzel & Van Gijn, in prep.).
Unfortunately, there seems to be a hitch in the tradition of passing on these stories
to younger generations. I have also recorded two half‐hour dialogues, simply by
leaving the minidisk recorder behind with two people, and asking them to “just
talk”, after which I went away. The rest of the data consists of elicitation, partly
original (or whatever came up from texts), partly checking the data from other
sources (mostly Day 1980, 1991).","[27, 28]"
"3.1 Introducing Yurakaré morphology
From the perspective of morphological typology, Yurakaré can be characterized as
an agglutinating language. In the ideal case of an agglutinating language “a word
may consist of more than one morpheme, but the boundaries between morphemes
in the word are always clear‐cut” (Comrie 1989a:43). This characterization fits
Yurakaré morphology to a high degree. There is some fusion, however, especially
within the system of participant reference on the verb. Here the categories of
person and number are fused, and sometimes also semantic function (e.g. in the
cross‐referencing system, cf. section 5.1). On the whole, however, Yurakaré
morphology provides us with a fairly straightforward picture of an agglutinating
language.
On another dimension, isolating versus polysynthetic, Yurakaré can be placed
more towards the polysynthetic end, as was suggested already by the morpheme
per word ratio. I take polysynthetic to mean the possibility “to combine a large
number of morphemes, be they lexical or grammatical, into a single word,
corresponding to a sentence of English” (Comrie 1989a:45). Yurakaré, with its
elaborate person reference system and applicatives (cf. sections 5.1 and 5.2) fits
this description. To give an example, consider the following:
(1)abti‐ma‐y‐mala‐ma
1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG
‘Go and get them for me!’ [AA‐15MA‐9]
ti‐ma‐la‐che‐ø
1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐3
‘He ate them from me (e.g. from my plate).’ [MV‐14MA‐26]I have not counted zero morphemes and I have counted bound roots + required
derivational morphemes as one. I did count enclitics. The total number of words was 6,976,
the total number of morphemes 14,289.",[62]
"1.2 The Yurakaré language
1.2.1 Previous work
Up until now, the Yurakaré language has received relatively little attention. The
first study devoted completely to the language was La Cueva (1893). This
publication had been prepared by the Franciscan priest La Cueva at the beginning
of the nineteenth century. His notes were brought to France by Alcides d’Orbigny
and edited by Lucien Adam who eventually published them in 1893 8. The
publication consists of a grammatical description and a word list.
The grammatical description, taking up 52 pages, covers many different areas:
from sounds to nominal and verbal morphosyntax, interjections and conjunctions,
as well as some example sentences. The word list covers 68 pages and is Spanish‐
Yurakaré. It is a rich source containing highly valuable material. It is also the first
attempt to devise a spelling for the language, even though this proposal is not
made explicit in the grammar.
The next study devoted to the language is also by a Franciscan priest, Lassinger
(1915). This is a grammatical description, which is much more modest in
comparison to La Cueva’s work. It consists of around 15 pages, which give
information about nominal and verbal conjugations. There is no word list.
Lassinger’s work has been reprinted in Ribera et al. (1991).
In 1980 and 1991, Marge Day produced two further important studies: a rather
large word list both Yurakaré‐Spanish (115 pages) and Spanish‐Yurakaré (123
pages), and a didactic grammar. In this grammar a consistent spelling is devised
(cf. section 2.2), and the study of the grammatical characteristics is taken out of theBrinton (1891:297) summoned publishers to publish the manuscript of La Cueva. This
possibly may have led to the publication two years later.",[21]
"6.2 Aspect
Aspectual distinctions are only partly expressed morphologically in Yurakaré. The
language has four distinct aspect markers (not counting the propositional markers with
aspectual meaning, cf. sections 7.2.4‐7.2.7): a‐ ‘incompletive’, ‐jti ‘habitual’, ‐nishi ‘near
completive’ and ‐lë ‘recent completive’. Apart from this there is a morphologically
expressed system of verbal number which has two different manifestations: one that is
sensitive to the number of participants, and another that purely indicates the number184The verb phraseof events, regardless of the number of participants. Other aspectual distinctions are
indicated in periphrastic ways, or by propositional markers, which will be the topic of
chapter 1.
Imperfective aspect can be divided into two major subaspects in Yurakaré: ongoing
processes vs. repeated processes. Periphrastically both repetition and ongoing
processes can be marked simply by repeating the predicate:
(8)abcamala‐ø samma amala‐ø samma amala‐ø
samma

come‐3 water

‘The water was coming and coming.’ (OR‐20MA‐1)

shëwë‐shta‐ø
3SG‐go.PL‐3=PL evening‐FUT‐3
‘After they had taken her far away –they took her and took her and took her– it
became evening.’ (OR‐20MA‐8)In (8)a, the repetition of amala samma indicates that the water was coming during a long
stretch of time and augmentatively. In (8)b repetition indicates recurrence, whereas in
(8)c, it indicates an ongoing event.
Apart from this means of marking duration and iterativity, adverbs, such as chajtiya
in (8)b are used to mark these aspectual distinctions. Aspectual adverbs will be the
topic of section 6.5.2 below. Another periphrastic way of marking aspect is by means of
a number of auxiliaries (cf. chapter 8.2.1)
As mentioned above, Yurakaré also has morphological means to mark aspectual
distinctions. There are separate markers for incompletive, habitual and iterative aspect.
The latter is marked by a system of verbal number, which will be discussed below.","[199, 200]"
"The ClauseThis chapter deals with clauses. Clauses in Yurakaré consist minimally of a
predicate, and optionally of overtly expressed arguments, and/or adverbs and
particles. First I will discuss simple clauses (8.1), then I will go on to discuss
complex constructions (8.2), such as complementation, relative clauses, adverbial
clauses and coordination.
8.1 The simple clause
In (1), there are three participants on stage, the addressee (subject), the wound (it),
and the beneficiary (her). None of these three participants is expressed overtly:
(1)tishi
ka‐n‐tëptë‐cha‐m
konsono
now 3SG‐IO‐wash‐JUS‐2SG.S
well
‘Now wash it [wound] well for her.’ (FL‐14MA‐1)In fact, text analyses show that objects and subjects are overtly expressed in only
25.6% (objects 1) and 28.1% (subjects) of all clauses. Table 45 below shows how
different types of predicates behave in terms of the (non‐)expression of arguments.
It also shows the word order of predicates and arguments when the latter are
overtly expressed. I looked at five texts: three mythological narratives, one
explanatory text and one conversation. I counted the number of instances where
the subject was not expressed (Vs), and the subject was overtly expressed;
furthermore, I counted the number of instances where it was expressed after the
verb (VS) and before the verb (VS). I did the same for objects.

The form acha(ya) is used for purposive or objective clauses:321A grammar of Yurakaré(115) ablëtta shunñe bëbi‐shti

have a certain advantageous result. The complement that follows achaya is often
marked with ‐cha, but this is not necessarily so. In (115)a the complement is
marked with the future marker ‐shta; the marker ‐ni (intentional) is also possible:

2SG‐want‐3
‘What do you want to eat: fish or fried pieces of dough?’ [FA‐28MA‐1]If there is disjunctive coordination between two clauses or two noun phrases, both
coordinands are preceded by kusuti. This is bisyndetic (Haspelmath 2004:4)
coordination, involving two coordinators.
Kusuti is also used to indicate uncertainty (‘maybe’), cf. section 6.5.3:
(118) kusuti
lëshie domingu‐ø=ti i‐saa‐ø=w=ya
a‐judyu

Sunday‐3=DS VBL‐fruit‐3=PL=NVR 3SG.P‐joco:PL
‘After maybe two weeks, his joco’s had fruit.’ (AR‐8MI‐43)I consider this to be the basic meaning of kusuti, which is compatible with its use
as a disjunctive coordinator.
Relative clauses have an encoding strategy alternative to the construction
described in sections 8.2.3 and 8.2.4, involving two balanced clauses, without any
subordinating enclitic. The semantic role of the relativized item is then indicated
on a demonstrative (usually bëti or sometimes ati):322The clause(119) abcdam=chi ka‐bushu‐ø

‘Where is the man that I sent my dog to?’[MH‐24MA‐8]The demonstrative pronoun bë‐ti is a ‘landing site’ for postpositions. Note that in
(119)c and d, the relation between the predicate of the relative clause and the head
of that clause is still indicated on the predicate. The alternation between the
enclitic and free pronoun strategy may point to the fact that the enclitic =ti is
connected to the deictic element ti in ati and bëti.
The demonstrative pronoun strategy is more widely applicable, for instance to
mark reason clauses:
(120) nishotto‐ø=ya
ta‐buyta ati=la
tuwa
nish
riku‐tu
NEG
go.out‐3=NVR 1PL‐chief DEM=INS 1PL.PRN NEG
rich‐1PL.S
‘Our chief did not come out, therefore we are not rich.’ (AR‐8MI‐78)The utterance in (120) is taken from a mythological story, which can be termed the
genesis of the Yurakaré. With the events of this story reasons are given why the
current situation of the Yurakaré Indians is the way it is. One of the events is that
the founding father of the Yurakaré Indians, Tiri, makes the Yurakaré people come
out of a hole in the ground, but the hole closes before the leader of the Yurakaré
can come out, so the Yurakaré are left without leadership. That is the reason that
they are not rich right now.
As for coordination, the simplest strategy possible is used: two juxtaposed
balanced clauses without any element indicating the nature of the combination of
clauses (asyndetic in Haspelmath’s [2004:4] terms):
(121) abayla~la‐y
ajanta~ta‐y
dance~DST‐1SG.S sing~DST‐1SG.S
‘I am dancing and singing.’ [VL‐24MA‐11]This asyndetic strategy is also used for coordinating two NPs, in addition to the
coordinating construction with latijsha ‘then’, discussed above:323A grammar of Yurakaré(122) latijsha na

then DEM boy=EMPH

3SG‐IO‐tell:3PL.S=NVR
‘Then the boy and the girl did not tell him.’ (AY‐3NC‐6)Another strategy to coordinate two NPs is by means of the postposition =tina
‘comitative’:
(123) latijsha wilita‐ø=w=ya
na
pëpësu aysa=tina
then
return‐3=PL=NVR DEM
Pëpësu Aysa=COM
‘Then Pëpësu and Aysa returned.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)Although the meaning of =tina here seems quite close to conjunction, in many
cases the two NPs that are associated by means of the postposition =tina are not
entirely coordinate. Therefore it is more fruitful to regard =tina as a comitative
marker rather than a conjunction marker. For more discussion on the postposition
=tina, cf. section 4.3.1. The comitative strategy is not available for the conjunction
of two clauses.","[335, 336, 337, 338, 339]"

mostly be translated with English the:

deictic ati) Puydaras are not like these (ana‐pshë, exophorically used), the (na
established referent) Puydaras are other jaguars.
The question word ama
There are three basic question words in Yurakaré: ama ‘which, what, who’, ëshë ‘why’
and tëtë ‘what’. Of these three only ama is nominal; tëtë is adjectival and ëshë is
adverbial.
The question word ama can combine with a number of markers to form new question
words:

‘Whose canoe is that?’ [DAY‐1980‐1]This marker is not used very often in the areas that I worked in at the time of my

There are two types of adjectives in Yurakaré: qualifying and quantifying (numerals
and quantifiers).","[147, 148, 149]"
"Propositional markersPalmer (2001:7‐8) distinguishes event modality from propositional modality, the
latter being concerned “with the speaker’s attitude to the truth value or factual
status of the proposition”. Event modality, in contrast, refers to “events that are
not actualized, events that have not taken place but are merely potential”. Event
modality has been discussed in section 6.3 above, the focus in this section will
therefore be on propositional modality (and aspect).
Yurakaré has a set of enclitics that encode distinctions at the propositional level.
These markers fall into two classes, on the basis of their placement in the sentence.
There is a set of propositional enclitics which mostly attach to the rightmost word
of a clause, regardless of the grammatical category of that word (clausal enclitics).
There is another set of propositional enclitics that attach to the main verb of a
clause (verbal enclitics). These latter markers are placed right after the subject
person markers in the verb complex, thus reflecting their scope:
(1)objects ‐ derivation ‐ root ‐ derivation ‐ TMA ‐ subject = propositional markersI consider these verbal enclitics to be enclitics because of their position within the
verb. They follow the plural marker =w of the third person plural subject. As
outlined in section 3.2.5, =w should be considered an enclitic, and therefore all the
morphosyntactic material that follows this element should be considered enclitics
as well, since affixes cannot attach to clitics (cf. Zwicky & Pullum 1983:503).
An overview of the two groups of enclitics is given in Table 42:

notable information (M/F)
‘se’
momentaneous

discontinuativeAs can be judged from the glosses, the functions of propositional enclitics in
Yurakaré relate to aspect and modality. It is quite difficult to separate these two
functions, since enclitics with aspectual values can also have modal meanings and
vice versa. More generally, it is very difficult to determine the exact meaning of
the enclitics, since they can be used in so many different situations.
In this chapter I will describe each of the propositional enclitics in their own
right, as far as that is possible, since they often occur in combination with other231A grammar of Yurakarépropositional enclitics or with event‐related modal and aspectual markers. I will
first discuss the verbal enclitics (7.1), followed by an account of the clausal
propositional markers (7.2). In 7.3, finally, I will give an overview of the
combinatory possibilities.
This chapter is exploratory in character and should be seen as a first
approximation of the data. Many of the enclitics are difficult to interpret, since
they occur in many different situations. Further research is needed to achieve a
better understanding of these enclitics.","[246, 247]"
"Not all adverbs are present in this table, only the ones that are represented by enough
examples.
17 It should be borne in mind that these are just tendencies. There is no absolute placement rule.
Nevertheless, some adverbs seem to be more fixed as to their position than others, notably nish,
kaj, kani and sey as preverbal adverbs; ushta and latiji as postverbal adverbs.
16222The verb phrase6.6 Interjections and ideophones
Interjections and ideophones, together with enclitic particles, in Yurakaré can be seen
as forming part of a larger class of particles. Particles can be distinguished from other
word classes on morphological, syntactic and to a certain extent also phonological
grounds (cf. sections 3.3.5‐3.3.7). They fall into four sub‐classes. Here I will discuss
interjections and onomatopoetic particles; enclitic particles will be discussed in sections
4.2 and 4.3 (nominal enclitics), chapter 1 (propositional – modal and aspectual –
enclitics) and sections 8.2.2‐8.2.4 (subordinating enclitics).","[237, 238]"
"8.2 Complex clauses
In this section I will discuss complex constructions, consisting of two or more
combined predicates. There are two parameters involving the coding of complex
clauses in Yurakaré: first, the inflection on the verb (i.e. do the combined
predicates have the same range of possibilities marking TMA and person
agreement?) and second, specific morphemes indicating subordination.
Starting with subordinating 12 morphemes, there are three different enclitics that
can have a subordinating function: =ya, =ja and =ti. They indicate different degrees
of semantic unity with the main predicate, as will become clear in the following
sections. Furthermore, there is a limited set of independent words indicating that
two clauses should be considered together. This latter construction is mostly
confined to coordination.
Regarding the form of the verb, Stassen (1985) makes a distinction between
balancing and deranking strategies. A verb form is considered to be deranked if it
differs from an independent verb form in the sense that it has limited or different
possibilities for marking TMA and argument agreement. A dependent verb form
is considered to be balanced if it has the form of an independent verb, with all its
TMA and agreement. In Yurakaré, in combination with the three subordinating
morphemes, the following possibilities are attested, examples of each construction
will follow in the next sections (8.2.1‐8.2.5):

=ti

‐
As can be seen in Table 51, there is a deranked subordinate form not marked by a
special subordinating morpheme 13. In these constructions, subordination is
With subordinate predicates I mean predicates that are functionally and grammatically
dependent on another predicate either because they share subject markers and/or TMA
morphemes with it, or because they are marked for having the same or a different subject
than the main predicate. Subordination in this view does not necessarily mean that the
subordinate verb form is deranked.
13 It is not clear whether it is possible to speak of a deranked form here, since it rather
seems a construction involving a complex predicate; nevertheless, the leftmost verb in
these constructions seems to have more inflectional possibilities.
12290The clausemarked by the fact that subject agreement and TMA marking are not present on
the deranked predicate.
Subordinate forms with =ya are also deranked; they show no subject agreement
and in their marking of TMA distinctions they are dependent on the main
predicate. There are also independent clauses marked with =ya. In those
circumstances =ya indicates non‐veridical modality (cf. section 7.1.1).
The column under =ja has two ‘+’‐values. With this I mean that there are both
balanced and deranked constructions marked with =ja. I will discuss the relevant
conditions in 8.2.3 below.
Clauses marked with =ti have the full range of possibilities for marking TMA
and person marking. The difference with the balanced versions of =ja‐marked
clauses is that the =ja clauses must have the same subject as the main predicate 14,
while =ti marked clauses normally have a subject different from that of the main
predicate. Moreover, =ti is the only subordinating morpheme that can be further
specified by means of a postposition (cf. section 8.2.4).
In the last column of Table 51, there is an unmarked, balanced combination of
clauses. This means that the combined predicates each have the full range of
possibilities of person marking and TMA‐marking. The meaning of the
combination can be specified by means of an independent word. Most of these
constructions are coordinated.
The five strategies mentioned in Table 51 form a continuum: from left to right
the grammatical integration with the main predicate is increasingly lower.
According to Givón (2001b:40), “the stronger the semantic bond between the two
events, the more extensive will be the syntactic integration of the two clauses into
a single though complex clause”. This means that a decline of grammatical
coherence should coincide with a decrease of semantic coherence with the main
predicate.
In the next sections (8.2.1‐8.2.5) I will describe the five strategies used for clause
combining in turn, indicating their formal and functional properties. In section
8.2.6 I give some alternative strategies used to encode clause combinations. In
section 8.2.7, finally, I will give an overview of the types of clause combinations
and the way they are marked.","[305, 306]"
"8.1.6 Word order and pragmatic status
As can be concluded from Tables 45, 48 and 49 above, the order of predicates and
their arguments in Yurakaré is fairly flexible. This is directly connected to the fact
that all grammatical relations are marked either on the verb or by postpositions on
the dependent noun phrase. This flexibility of word order makes it rather difficult
to come up with a basic word order.
Nevertheless, overtly expressed subjects (both S and A 8) seem to have a clear
preference for the postverbal position. Occurrences of preverbal subjects can often
be explained in terms of special pragmatic status, whereas overtly expressed
pragmatically neutral subjects are generally found in postverbal position.
Preverbal subjects are almost invariably emphatic topics, though not every
marked topic ends up before the verb. Givón (2001b:253‐269) mentions a number
of cross‐linguistically found marked topics and discusses the morphosyntax
associated with these. What Givón calls ‘existential‐presentative constructions’,
I take A here to mean subjects of all two‐ and three‐place predicates, including extended
intransitives and extended transitives.",[293]
"3.3.3 Verbs
Verbs are prototypically actions: agentive actions involving concrete participants,
having a relatively short duration, and spatially more diffuse than nouns (Givón
2001‐I:52).
The typical function of a verb is the predicative function (Croft 2003:184‐185,
Schachter 1985:9). This is not a distinguishing feature of verbs in Yurakaré,
however. Nouns and adjectives can also function as (stative) predicates without
any overt formal marking that indicates a change in lexical category.

Arsenio will be a teacher.’ [AT‐3MI‐121]Example (86)a is taken from a mythological text in which a Guayabochi tree
changes into a person. Now this person is telling a woman that he was the
Guayabochi tree. The subject sëja is marked with the emphasis marker =ja, which
appears almost exclusively on subjects. Furthermore, the predicate ulëy takes the
subject cross‐reference marker ‐y for first person singular. The word that functions
as a predicate has the notional characteristics of a noun, referring to a concrete,79A grammar of Yurakaréeven specific item. In (86)b the predicate nominal is marked for future tense, a
category normally associated with verbs.
Some predicate nominals can even take applicative prefixes. In the following
examples the affected object applicative (cf. 5.2.4) triggers the interpretation of
detachment in (87)a; in (87)b, the attachment‐reading is caused by the indirect
object applicative (cf. 5.2.3):

DEL‐3PL‐IO‐tooth‐FUT‐3
subsequently
‘He provided them with teeth.’ (AR‐8MI‐35)In (87)a, the predicate function is performed by a noun, which also refers to a
concrete and specific object. Like in (86)a, this predicate takes subject cross‐
reference marking (for second person singular and plural) and the overtly
expressed subject argument is marked with the emphasis marker =ja. However, in
(87)a we can also see that the object word can take valency increasing morphology
(the prefix la‐ for affected object ‐ cf. section 5.2.4) and consequently an object
complement, referring to the person who got his penis cut off. In (87)b, the
predicate nominal, not specific this time, takes another kind of applicative and is
modified by an adverb. Furthermore it takes the future tense marker ‐shta.
Adjectives can be used as predicates as easily as object‐words (nouns):

‘What do you find really beautiful, mother?’ (AR‐8MI‐50)In (88)a the property word functions as a predicate (cf. the non‐veridical enclitic
=ya, which only attaches to predicates. In (88)b, the property word yita takes the
subject marker ‐p for second person plural, and in (88)c, shuyulë takes the
applicative marker n‐ as well as the habitual marker ‐jti.
Verbs, in short, cannot be distinguished from adjectives and nouns on the basis
of their function as predicates. However, verbs cannot be arguments of predicates
without any overt marking. They can be arguments of verbs either when they80Morphologyform a compound with the noun bëshë ‘entity’ or under a certain analysis with the
different subject marker =ti (cf. chapter 8.2.4):

DEM=DIRbThere is no clear answer to the question whether the ti‐marked clause indicates a
‘when’‐clause rather than a real argument, i.e.: ‘When I had harvested my rice I
was finished.’ However, ti‐marked clauses can take postpositions, which are

‘We could not walk when we were drunk.’ [FA‐28MA‐1]The sequence poyde winanitu seems to be a case where a verb (winanitu), without
any further measures being taken is used as an argument of the verb (Hengeveld’s
1992 criterion). However, on closer scrutiny, there seem to be measures that have
been taken after all. The matrix verb poyde does not carry any subject marking, and
is conjoined to the adjacent VP. In fact, as I will be discussing in chapter 8.2.1, this
is one way of marking subordination. The matrix verb can also be fully inflected,
but then the complement verb has to be marked by means of the enclitic =ti.

nouns can be in adjectival function as long as their meaning allows for it:81A grammar of Yurakaré(93) anashunñe bobo‐y=ti

‘Tiri made it [i.e. the Bible] like this when he lived on this earth.’ (AR‐8MI‐76)Payne (1997:111) considers a ‘family’ of constructions related to predicate
nominals: ‘proper’ predicate nominals, i.e. clauses indicating proper inclusion or
attribution – Stassen’s categories (ii) and (iii) – predicate locatives, existentials and
predicative possession. He sets up the following continuum for predicate
nominals, based on the likelihood of the constructions having a semantically rich
verb (p.113):

clausesWe have already seen that the leftmost category does not have a semantically rich
verb, and that predicate locative clauses usually do have a semantically rich verb,
although constructions without such a verb marginally occur.
Purely existential constructions normally have a location verb:

‘Are there any?’ (DV‐14MA‐1)Example (11)a occurs at the beginning of a story, when the principal character is
introduced. Example (11)b comes from a dialogue in which one of the
interlocutors starts talking about beehives that he has seen. This is a surprise to the
other interlocutor so she verifies whether there indeed are any.
There are occasions where an existential sentence occurs without a semantically
rich verb:273A grammar of Yurakaré(12) lëtta
tejte‐ø=la

‘There was this woman.’ (OR‐19MA‐29)Possessive predication may lack a verb, since the following examples constitute

‘The agouti once had a tail, he was like a squirrel.’ (AR‐8MI‐44)Another possessive construction, used for temporal possession, is with the verb
tütü ‘sit, be’ and a comitative applicative (cf. section 5.2.1):
(15) tëtë‐pshë
ka‐tütü‐m=chi
what‐entity 3SG‐sit;be‐2SG.S=IGN
‘What do you have with you?’ (AR‐8MI‐23)Locomotion clauses always have a semantically rich verb. Whereas location verbs
differ from each other in manner, distinctions between locomotion verbs usually
concern the path of motion, e.g. otto ‘go out’ vs. yupa ‘go in’; danda ‘go up’ vs.
shopto ‘go down’.
Payne’s continuum for Yurakaré can be displayed as follows:

used as predicates) as their only strategy. All other categories, except for
locomotion clauses, have possibilities to be expressed without a semantically rich
verb, but canonically, they have an overt predicative element.","[286, 287, 288, 289, 290]"
"3.3.7 Enclitic particles
Finally, there is a set of clitic particles. These clitics are distinguished from other
words on purely formal grounds. These formal characteristics have been
discussed in section 3.2.5 above and will not be repeated here. Instead, I focus on
the subclassification of the clitics. Clitics in Yurakaré fall into three groups:
nominal, verbal and clausal.
Nominal clitics attach to the last word of the noun phrase, obeying the following
template:
(100) [NP]=number=postpositionsAs far as their meaning is concerned, nominal enclitics have to do with relational
marking (postpositions) and number.
Verbal clitics attach to the right of the predicate, independently of the position of
adverbs, objects and the like:
(101) samu=ja
tiya‐ø=w=ya latiji
jaguar:PL=EMPH
eat‐3=NVR
subsequently
‘The jaguars ate his father.’ (FA‐6MA‐5)a‐tata
3SG.P‐fatherIn (101), the verb is followed by an adverb and an overt expression of the object.
Still, the enclitics =w and =ya attach to the verb. The meaning of verbal enclitics is
related to number, modality, and aspect.",[103]

go.down‐3 table 3SG.P‐body=ABL
‘The cat came down from the table.’ [FR‐PC]As with =tina and =la above, the use of these markers is extended on the basis of these
core functions. The stative location marker can sometimes also mark the goal of a
movement:

mitchi danda‐ø mesa a‐dojo=y
cat
go.up‐3 table 3SG.P‐body=LOC
‘The cat climbed onto the table.’ [FR‐1TA‐4]The marking of a goal with the stative locative marker happens with predicates that
have an inherent direction, like yupa ‘to enter’, dele ‘to fall down’, danda ‘to go up’. This
marking is optional: the complement can also be marked by the directional marker:
(60) Juan yupa‐ø
a‐sib=chi
3SG.P‐house=DIR
Juan go.in.SG‐3
‘Juan entered his house.’ [FR‐PC]There is no difference in the interpretation of a complement marked by =y and a
complement marked by =chi with these movement verbs with inherent direction.
The other way round is also possible: a directional marker marking location. It is not
clear what the difference is between stative locations marked with =chi and =y.

2000:104): “(…) languages systematically and extensively refer to stationary111A grammar of Yurakarécircumstances with forms and constructions whose basic reference is to motion. We can
term this constructional fictive motion.”
There are more instances of fictive motion in Yurakaré: the ablative marker can mark
a stative location, and even the goal of a movement in some instances:
(62) abclëtta shunñe li‐tütü‐ø
ayma a‐pasha=jsha

ti‐la‐dyalala‐ø
ti‐tanti=jsha
1SG‐AFO‐spit‐3 1SG‐eye=ABL
‘He spat into my eye.’ [FP‐15MA‐3]If an entity is on the outside of some bounded location, it can be marked by the ablative
marker. So in (62)a, the entity Juan is on the outside of the location fire, and in (62)b, on
the outside of the back of the head, referred to by the demonstrative ana. Example (62)c
has a predicate with inherent direction (yupa, ‘to enter’), so the complement may be
marked as a stative location. Since we are dealing with a figure (mosquito) which is on
the outside of the location (eye), the complement can be marked by the ablative marker
=jsha, even if it marks the goal of a movement.
Another extension of the locational markers =y and =jsha is that they can be used to
derive temporal adverbs:
(63) abcati‐kka=y
DEM‐MEA=LOC
‘in, during that time’
numa=jsha
night=ABL
‘tomorrow’
l‐ati=jsha
REF‐DEM=ABL
‘then, after that’The first example literally means ‘in the size of that’, but can be interpreted as a
temporal adverb, meaning ‘in that stretch of time’. Numajsha ‘tomorrow’ literally
means ‘from the night’, interpreted as ‘after the night’. Latijsha, finally, is a frequently
used discourse‐structuring adverb. The prefix l‐, together with the demonstrative ati,
refers to a previously mentioned event; the ablative marker indicates that the event that
follows occurs subsequently.
The ablative marker =jsha is also used to mark the standard in comparative clauses:112The noun phrase(64) së=ja
tëchi‐kka‐y
më=jsha
1SG.PRN=EMPH tall‐MEA‐1SG.S

‘I am taller than you.’[MH‐7MA‐7]Finally, the ablative marker is used in the following construction (data from Day 1980‐
28):
(65) lëshie=w=jsha
two=PL=ABL
‘one of the two’ [DAY‐1980‐28]As already transpired in some of the above examples, location can be made more
specific by the use of a limited set of relator nouns:

‘in the inside of the house’4.3.4 The enclitic =ja
The enclitic =ja is in complementary distribution with the adpositions mentioned
above. It is found almost exclusively on subjects, but it does not mark a grammatical
relation. Firstly because, if it did mark subject, one would expect the marker to be
obligatory, and it is not. Second, it is possible to mark non‐subjects with this marker,
though it is extremely rare:
(69) nama‐wësh‐shunñe‐jti=ja
ka‐chamashi‐ø=w
DEM
3PL‐in.law‐man‐HAB=EMPH
3SG‐control‐3=PL
‘As for their father‐in‐law, they controlled him.’ (OR‐19MA‐3)In almost all cases it is found on grammatical subjects. According to Day (1980), it
serves as a disambiguating subject marker: “[it] marks the subject and must be used
when there might be the slightest ambiguity” (Day 1980‐5). Though this may certainly
be one of its functions, it also appears in sentences where there is no ambiguity at all:
(70) Juan=ja
li‐tütü‐ø
sibbë
inel=chi
Juan=EMPH DEL‐sit;be‐3 house
inside=DIR
‘John is inside his house.’ [FR‐1TA‐4]There is no possible interpretation that the house is inside Juan. It can also appear in
sentences where the marking on the verb in itself is disambiguating enough:
(71) lëtta yee=ja
ti‐n‐wita‐ø
one woman=EMPH
1SG‐IO‐arrive.SG‐3
‘A woman came to me.’ (AR‐8MA‐24)In sentences without any complement it can also appear, even when there is no one to
confuse the subject with:
(72) së=ja
ulë‐y
1SG.PRN=EMPH guayabochi.tree‐1SG.S
‘I was the guayabochi tree.’(AR‐8MA‐7)114The noun phraseAnd it is also used in the following way:
(73) mi‐meme=ja
2SG‐mother=EMPH
‘And your mother? (where is she?)’Its main function is to mark emphatic topics. This is its function in the examples (70)‐
(73). For instance, the context of the myth from which example (72) is taken is that a
man changed from a guayabochi tree into a man, because a woman always scratched
that tree. He appears before the woman and says that he was the one that was the
guayabochi tree (he and no other), which could be translated into English with a cleft
construction: “it was I who was the guayabochi tree”. In (69), where a non‐subject is
marked with =ja there is a switch of topic. In the preceding context the subjects of the
sentence first punished their father‐in‐law for something he did to them, and then they
punish their spouses, then the utterance in (69) follows. Finally, sudden appearances of
participants in a story are often marked with =ja (from the same story):
(74) latijsha maj~matata
wowore=ja
tütü‐ø=ya
püü=y
then
INTS~big
snake=EMPH sit;be‐3=NVR road=LOC
‘Then (suddenly) there was a big snake on the road.’ (AR‐8MA‐77)In conclusion we can say that =ja is a marker of emphatic topic and not of subject.","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"
"23301A grammar of YurakaréSummarizing, the ya‐clause cannot agree with its subject, it can carry TMA
information, but the TMA information on the main verb has scope over the
dependent ya‐clause as well. Furthermore, the ya‐clause usually precedes the
inflected verb, but this is not necessarily so, nor do the two predicates need to be
adjacent.
As described in the previous chapter, =ya marks non‐veridical events (cf. section
7.1.1). There is reason to believe that we are dealing with one and the same
morpheme here. This morpheme occurs as a marker of a dependent clause when
the construction as a whole is habitual, optative, imperative or future tense. What
ties these situations together is their irrealis status 24; therefore we can assume that
we are dealing with one and the same morpheme. The fact that we are dealing
with a subordinate construction is supported by the fact that the ya‐clause is
deranked, with limited possibilities for at least person marking, and often, an
intonation phrase typical for non‐completed sentences, where pitch is raised at the
penultimate syllable and maintained at the final syllable. Especially sentence
initial ya‐clauses are marked by the typical rising intonation of a not‐yet
completed sentence.
Functionally, ya‐clauses can be used to mark some types of adverbial clauses:
conditional, purposive, and temporal clauses. They can also mark coordinate
clauses. Examples of temporal ya‐clauses, some of them repetitions of earlier
examples, are given in (64):

are co‐temporal. In each of the clauses, the main clause is marked for non‐
assertion and the subjects are identical.","[316, 317]"
"5.2.6 Verbs beginning with /i/160Verbal agreement, voice & valencyTransitive verbs beginning with the sound /i/ usually mark their direct object in a
deviant way. First and second persons and the third person plural are encoded as an
indirect object:

palanta=w
1SG.PRN=EMPH 3PL‐IO‐sow;plant‐FUT:1SG.S banana=PL
‘I am going to plant bananas.’ [FL‐20MA‐27]Underlyingly, all of the verb roots in (36) begin with the vowel /i/: idëjta ‘to miss’, idu
‘to fry’, idumaja ‘to molest’ and iñese ‘to sow, plant’. The participant encoded as an
indirect object here is slightly different from normal indirect‐object marking. The third
person singular is cross‐referenced with zero, i.e. as a ‘normal’ direct object, which is
evidence that we are in fact not dealing with indirect objects, but rather with direct
objects that are marked in a deviant manner:

mi‐tëjte
why molest‐FUT‐2SG.S=IGN 2SG‐grandmother
‘Why are you going to bother, cause trouble to your grandmother?’ (AR‐8MI‐46)Apparently there is some rule that says that the direct objects of transitive verb roots
beginning with /i/ are encoded as indirect objects, except for third person singular.
When for instance a beneficiary or a recipient is added, this is expressed as an affected
object:
(38) ti‐l‐idu‐ma
1SG‐AFO‐fry‐IMP.SG
‘Fry it for me!’ [FL‐23MA‐1]The affected object applied to a verb beginning with /i/ differs slightly in form, in that
the /a/ of the prefix la‐ is dropped:161A grammar of YurakaréHowever, there are instances where the indirect object does indicate a beneficiary, as
in the case with idu ‘fry’:
(39) ti‐n‐du‐ma
1SG‐IO‐fry‐IMP.SG
‘Fry it for me!’ [FL‐23MA‐1]It may be that the pragmatically marked meaning that a direct object interpretation
would yield here, forces the indirect object interpretation. Nevertheless, it is unclear
what the difference is between (38) and (39). In most cases the affected object takes over
the ‘vacancy’ left open by the indirect object, marking beneficiary/recipient‐type
participants:

‘I am cold.’
ku‐shujuta‐ø
3SG.CO‐warm‐3
‘He is warm, sweating.’ [AA‐12MA‐28]Cooperative objects can also be sympathetic experiencers:An alternative analysis would be that we are dealing with a verb le with a purposive object.
This would mean that we should analyze le as a movement verb. There is one other cognitive
verb that is based on a movement verb:
i. ku‐y‐mal‐uma‐ø
3SG.CO‐VPL‐go.SG‐DST‐3

10 The fact that we are dealing with a direct object here is evidenced by the fact that a third
person singular is cross‐referenced by a zero form.
9163A grammar of Yurakaré(45) të‐benebene‐ø
1SG.CO‐lamentable‐3
‘I am sympathizing with him, who is pitiful.’ [HC‐22MA‐6]Experiencers that undergo some emotion because they evaluate something as being
e.g. beautiful are often encoded as indirect objects:
(46) abti‐n‐kukku‐ø
1SG‐IO‐nice‐3
‘I like it.’
ti‐m‐pëlë‐ø
1SG‐IO‐finished‐3
‘I finished it.’Whereas the experiencers in (46) have control over the situation, especially in (46)b,
experiencers that lack any control are generally marked as affected objects:
(47) abti‐la‐ñolele‐ø
1SG‐AFO‐desirable‐3
‘I want it, I feel desire for it’
li‐ti‐la‐sheta‐ø
DEL‐1SG‐AFO‐lost‐3
‘I forgot it (it escaped me).’There is one predicate that I am aware of that takes a direct object as an experiencer:
(48) ti‐jusu‐ø
1SG‐want‐3
‘I want it.’The question with all of these verbs is whether they are one‐place verbs with non‐
canonically marked subjects, or two place verbs of the type of English ‘please’ in ‘It
pleases me.’ The answer to this question can only be given for some of these predicates.
The predicate kukku ‘(be) nice’ is a word describing a property, which can be used as a
one‐place predicate:

(50) ti‐n‐kukku‐m
1SG‐IO‐nice‐2SG
‘I like you.’ [FL‐3MA‐5]Other experiencer predicates behaving like this are, among others: ñolele ‘desirable’,
sheta ‘lost’ pëlë ‘finished’, benebene ‘lamentable’, shujuta ‘hot’, and dyummë ‘cold’.
Problematic for this analysis are kusu 11 ‘want’ and ile ‘know’. These verbs do not
occur as one‐place predicates, nor do they take any phonetically salient subject
markers 12, a fact which renders an analysis as two‐place predicates problematic. These
verbs are probably best analyzed as impersonal verbs or as one‐place verbs with non‐
canonically marked subjects. In fact, Malchukov (in prep.) suggests that constructions
with non‐canonically marked subjects can in fact come about as reanalyses of
impersonal constructions. This historical change may be corroborated by the fact that
Day (1980‐40) 13 marks the following utterances as grammatical:
(51) abnishta‐jusu‐m

what song‐PL=EMPH 2PL‐know‐3=PL
‘Which songs do you (pl) know?’When confronted with these examples, consultants rejected them as ungrammatical. It
may be that in the regions I worked the construction has been reanalyzed.
I should also mention a handful of examples where the experiencer is a possessor (cf.
also section 4.4.1):Kusu is the underlying form which changes to jusu when preceded by a vowel.
Note that third person plural subject on kusu is also phonetically non‐salient, since the
element =w is not audible on a stem ending in /u/.
13 Even though Day printed her material in 1980, she has been working with the Yurakarés since
the 1950s. The fact that for the most part, she worked in other areas than I did may have
something to do with this too.

"10101A grammar of YurakaréThe last observation entails that clothing consisted of several patches of the inside of
the bark of the Ficus, hence the inherently plural status of clothing items, and the
mosquito net 11. Although we can explain the occurrence of the plural marker =w in
singular contexts with these nouns, we cannot predict which nouns will behave like
this. There are other artifacts and utensils that do not behave like this, like norpe
‘paddle’, which can be either singular or plural, or other body parts like shishta ‘finger’,
which is also a collection of bones, but can be either singular or plural. The noun pujshi
means ‘body hair’ or ‘fur’ and is always singular (see below). Only clothing items
always seem to belong to class I generically. There are, furthermore, other nouns in this
class that cannot be explained straightforwardly, such as yarru ‘chicha’, shuppëw ‘urine’,
ulliw ‘penis (adult)’, wiwiw ‘penis (child)’ 12. This means that, although there is a
semantic basis for this behavior, whether some noun is seen as inherently plural or not
is ultimately a lexically determined matter.
Class III and IV nouns (together forming a class of inherently singular nouns) are
among others typical mass nouns, scenery, some body parts, tools and utensils, crops,
as well as other categories. Examples are given in Table 22 (Spanish loanwords in
italics):

semantic patterns that emerge, but, as with the inherently plural nouns, we cannot
predict the nouns that fall into this class on purely semantic grounds, since there are
many exceptions to the semantic generalizations given in Table 22. For instance,
substances do not fall into these classes uniformly. There are substances that fall into
In spite of the quote from Richter (1930), Vincent Hirtzel (p.c.) commented that clothing is
usually made out of one single piece of bark. In that case another explanation should be sought.
12 Modifiers of ulliw and wiwiw cannot take the collective marker, so these two nouns are
somewhat deviant.
11102The noun phraseclass II, like yarru ‘maize beer’ and shuppëw ‘urine’. Looking at the body parts, the list
includes concepts that prototypically come in pairs, like meyye ‘ears’, dyukku ‘buttocks’
(and also e.g. tanti ‘eyes’ and tululu ‘lips’). There are also concepts in this class that are
prototypically singular, like, perente ‘forehead’, unti ‘nose’, ërumë ‘tongue’. However, a
noun like, pullë ‘testicle’ is a ‘normal’ count noun, which can be marked for plural.
Utensils are found in both the inherently plural class and the count noun class as well.
There are many crops in the count noun class, most of them larger crops than the ones
in the class of inherently singular nouns 13, but a noun like arush ‘rice’ can be
pluralized. 14 In short: meaning does not fully allow us to predict class membership.
This is ultimately a lexically determined matter; there seems to be a partially covert
system of number marking.
Within the semantic categories of Table 22, class IV nouns are mainly found in the
group of utensils (all inherently singular utensils are class IV) and in bounded mass.
Especially this latter observation might give us more insight into the nature of
collectivity in Yurakaré:
(34) abshudyul‐ima kudawa
beautiful‐COL lake
‘a beautiful lake’ [FL‐1MA‐4]
matat‐ima
adyuma
big‐COL
river
‘a big river’ [HC‐4MA‐3]The word samma ‘water’ can be used as a mass noun or as a count noun; in the latter
case modifiers are generally marked for collectivity:
(35) matat‐ima
samma
big‐COL
water
‘a big lake/river’ [FA‐5MA‐1]The suffix ‐ima apparently does not only denote that the quality or quantity expressed
by the modifier applies to a plurality as a whole, but it also means that this plurality is
bounded. This double function can be explained with the following overview from
Jackendoff (1991), taken from Corbett (2000:80):The size of crops may have something to do with the mass‐count distinction (cf. Corbett
2000:80, Jackendoff 1991).
14 The noun arush does not take the plural marker =w for phonological reasons, but it does
trigger plural agreement on the verb.

forces the interpretation that we are dealing with a bounded plurality:

of mass’:
(37) [‐bounded,‐internal structure][+bounded,‐internal structure]It is not clear whether class IV nouns denoting artefacts can be integrated into this
analysis. A list of some of the inherently singular nouns that take collective markers on
their modifiers is given in Table 24:

ironThe items in the left column of Table 24 are artifacts, items that might be considered to
consist of smaller parts or bounded mass. For instance a comb (as well as a basket) was
made out of lianas tied together (cf. Nordenskiöld 2003b:58), knives are bounded
bodies of iron, etc. However, this explanation is rather speculative and has a danger of
being circular. Therefore this hypothesis should ideally be tested with psycholinguistic
experiments. This falls outside the scope of this grammar.
There are contexts in which normal count nouns do not receive the plural marker in
contexts where they are plural, nor do they trigger plural agreement on the verb:104The noun phrase(38) too‐jti
ka 15‐ssë‐ø=ti
pu‐ø=ja
decheche‐ø=ya
bone‐LIM 3SG‐be‐3=DS
take.PL‐3=SS
meet;find.CAU‐3=NVR
‘It was full of bones, which she picked up and collected.’ (FA‐6MA‐5)In the example the speaker is talking about a plurality of bones, a fact that is stressed
by the presence of the plural stem puu ‘take’ (cf. section 6.2.2). The form too ‘bone’ is a
class I noun that can be marked for plural, but here it does not take the marker =w, nor
does it trigger plural verbal agreement. This is due to recategorization of the noun too.
It is represented as a mass of bones. Speakers translate this into Spanish with había puro
hueso ‘(lit.) there was pure bone’, meaning ‘there was bone all over the place’, much in
the same way it is possible to say ‘There was dog all over the road’ in English (cf.
Corbett 2000:81).
I have also found one instance of the reverse, where a class III noun is marked for
plural:
(39) pela‐jti‐ø=w
ñowwo lëshpëni=bë
peel‐HAB‐3=PL
manioc first=MOM
‘First they peel the yucca for a while.’
ñowwo pela=ya

‘When the yucca is peeled, they put them in the fire.’
latijsha ati kula‐ø=w=ti
ma‐müta‐jti‐ø=w
then
DEM boil‐3=PL=DS
3PL‐take.out‐HAB‐3=PL
‘Then, when they boil, they take them out.’ (FL‐1MA‐14)In the beginning of this text explaining how to make chicha (a drink made of – in this
case – manioc), the manioc is singular in the first sentence (ñowwo is a class III noun),
but in the second sentence, in between the verbs pelaya (singular agreement) and
limattaw (plural agreement) there is a switch from singular to plural where ñowwo
triggers plural verb agreement. In the last sentence the demonstrative pronoun ati has
no plural marking, but triggers plural marking on the verb.
It might be that somewhere in the process of making chicha something happens,
which makes the substance plural (e.g. the addition of water). This might be connected
to the fact that ‘problematic’ class II nouns dyarru ‘chicha’ and shuppëw ‘urine’ have
undergone processes (fermentation and digestion, respectively) 16. And it might also be
connected to the fact that artefacts (most of which are in class II and IV, beingThe prefix ka‐ marks a special state‐construction here. This construction will be discussed in
section (5.1) below.
16 I am grateful to Vincent Hirtzel for pointing out this fact to me.
15105A grammar of Yurakaréinherently collective) also undergo a process: manufacturing. However, how this is
connected to collectivity is not clear.
A final point worth mentioning here is that Yurakaré has a vocative plural marker,
optionally used when addressing a group:
(40) dula‐n‐tu
ta‐pojore
ti‐lele‐ypa
do;make‐INTL‐1PL.S
1PL‐canoe
1SG‐grandchild‐VOC.PL
‘Let’s make our canoe, my grandchildren.’ (OR‐20MA‐1)This vocative marker is simply added to the addressee, which is plural but loses the
redundant plural marker. The form of the suffix is related to the second person plural
object marker pa‐. Interestingly, the collective marker ‐ima has exactly the same formal
relation to the third person plural object marker ma‐, and both ‐ipa and ‐ima has the
function of grouping together aggregates.

there is no such form as ‐ita.","[116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"
"6.3 Mood & modality
As with aspect, many modality distinctions are encoded by means of propositional
enclitics, which will be the topic of the next chapter. Here we are concerned with event
modality, which is “concerned with the speaker’s attitude towards a potential future
event” (Palmer 2001:8).6.3.1 intentional ‐ni
The marker ‐ni indicates an action or state that has not (yet) taken place, which
nevertheless is in many cases an expected or even purposive reality. It has the
following functions:
(39) abcdwish

1SG‐want‐3 2SG‐IO‐tell‐INTL=DS
‘I want to tell you…’ (AR‐8MI‐82)In all of these examples the function of ‐ni is slightly different, but they all have in
common that they encode a non‐factual event. In (39)a, ‐ni indicates that we are dealing
with a wish; in (39)b, the /i/ is dropped before the first person plural marker,
exhortative action is marked. In (39)c ‐ni has a similar meaning as in b, but the meaning
can also be purely aspectual, not much different from the near completive marker ‐nishi
discussed in section 6.2:
(40) li‐ti‐ja‐n‐tta‐ma
lumulu aye‐ni
DEL‐1SG‐3SG‐IO‐put‐IMP.SG
warm
vomit‐INTL:1SG.S
‘Put on some warm water for me, I am about to vomit.’ (OR‐19MA‐30)In (39)d, ‐ni marks a presupposed, but not actualized situation. It can often be
translated with the English adverb ‘supposedly’. In (39)e, finally, ‐ni is found as a sort
of subjunctive marker. It is found in complements of verbs of desire, lack, fear etc, that
subcategorize for events that have not taken place yet. For more on this see sections
8.2.1, 8.2.4, and 8.2.7.
Even though ‐ni cannot always be translated as intentional action, I gloss it this way.
Firstly because the intentional reading (commissive and exhortative) is the most
frequently encountered function of ‐ni, but also because other uses of ‐ni can often be
analyzed in this way. For instance some of the occurences where ‐ni marks a
complement:
(41) nijpoydi=la
ma‐alkansa‐ni=ti
can:1SG.S=VAL
3PL‐reach‐INTL=DS
‘I could not, when I intended to reach them.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)NEGFurthermore, the ‘wish’‐reading is only possible in combination with the expressive
marker =yu (women) or =ri (for men).
When ‐ni is combined with a non‐first person, the interpretation is often that the
event is to take place at another location than the current position of the subject
(translocative):197A grammar of Yurakaré(42) abli‐wjwa‐ni‐ø=w 4

‘While you are going to hunt, I’ll cook.’ [FA‐24MA‐16]Imperatives are also often combined with ‐ni, where it also mostly gets the
translocative interpretation:

DEL‐look‐INTL‐IMP.SG=IGN
‘Go and look!’ (FA‐6MA‐7)

jungle=DIR go.SG=NVR search‐INTL‐JUS‐2SG.S stuff
‘Go to the jungle and find some [food] there.’ (AR‐8MI‐65)The marker ‐ni on nouns indicates that the entity is foreseen to come into existence:
(44) abmala‐ø=ja
ëwwë‐ø=ya elle
a‐sibë‐ni
go.SG‐3=SS
dig‐3=NVR ground 3SG.P‐house‐INTL
‘He went and dug the ground to make his house‐to‐be.’ (AY‐2NC‐2)

ta‐tiba‐ni=w
3PL‐search‐INTL‐INTL:1SG.S 1PL‐pet‐INTL=PL
‘I am going to go and look for our pets‐to‐be.’ (AR‐8MI‐51)In both examples of (44) there is talk of a future entity, an entity that does not exists as
such yet. In (44)b, the animals that the agent is going to search for already exist, but not
in the function of his pets.
In (44)b there is also a double intentional marker. If the marker ‐ni is followed by
another TMA suffix (including a second ‐ni), its meaning is again translocative:4The locative interpretation might also be due to the delimiter prefix li‐, cf. section 6.4.2.","[211, 212, 213]"
"3.2.2 Suffixing, prefixing, and infixing
As mentioned, Yurakaré has both prefixes and suffixes. The categories associated
with prefixes and suffixes are roughly as follows:
Table 12 ‐ categories of prefixes and objects
prefixessuffixesobject cross‐reference
object‐oriented valency
aspect
derivationsubject cross‐reference
subject‐oriented valency
tense, mood, aspect
derivationThe order of bound morphemes is fixed in Yurakaré, corresponding to their scope,
as well as to the distinction between derivation and inflection. By derivational
morphemes I mean morphemes that “form new words either by changing the
meaning of the base to which they are attached (…) or by changing the word‐class
that a base belongs to” (Katamba 1993:47). “Inflectional morphemes are only able
to modify the form of a word so that it can fit in a particular syntactic slot”
(Katamba 1993:51).
In the following examples, we can see that inflection is generally found more
towards the edge of a word, while derivation is closer to the root. Consider first:51A grammar of Yurakaré(14) aana‐kka‐ø=tika‐l‐i‐sibë‐ø
3SG‐AFO‐VBL‐house‐3
‘When he was this big, she made him a house.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)
tütü‐mashi‐ø=w=ya
sit‐LD‐3=PL=NVR
‘They stayed a little.’ (AR‐8MI‐60)DEM‐MEA‐3=DSbIn (14)a, there are several derivational affixes. On the demonstrative pronoun ana,
there is a derivational element deriving a measure ‘this size’. This derivation also
changes the word class, turning it into an adjectival element, used as a predicate
here. The derivational element is followed by a zero morpheme. I will argue for
the existence of this zero morpheme in section 3.2.5 below. In the same section, I
will discuss enclitics, of which =ti is an example. The second (main) predicate in
(14)a has its cross‐referencing object morpheme ka‐ leftmost, more towards the
verb root, we find the derivational elements l‐ (shortened form of la‐) ‘affected
object’‐applicative and i‐ ‘verbalizer’. The prefix la‐ (or l‐ before a vowel) is an
applicative prefix which increases the valence of a verb, which, in this case, has the
role of beneficiary. The prefix i‐ is a category‐changing prefix, deriving verbs from
nouns. In (14)b, the verb root is followed by a derivational element ‐mashi, which
indicates that the event is carried out to a limited degree (a little), followed by the
subject marker ‐ø and the plural morpheme =w.
As far as tense, mood and aspect are concerned, the order seems to follow the
relevance principle (Bybee 1985), which says that an affix is placed closer to the
root the more relevant it is to the meaning of the root from a cognitive point of
view.
The only tense marker ‐shta ‘future tense’ is found before the subject markers, as
is event‐related modality and aspect 5. Modality and aspect that is more
propositional related (epistemic) or related to expressive and interactional motives
of the speaker are external to the person markers (cf. sections 7.1 and 7.2)
Infixing is a marginal process in Yurakaré. A first possible example of this is a
variant of the imperative singular (cf. section 6.3.5) marker <‐n‐> (with allomorph
[m]) with verbs that start with the vowel /i/. Examples of infixing of this type often
involve roots that seem to be complex in one way or another; hence we may not be
dealing with infixing after all:The only prefixed aspectual markers a‐ ‘incompletive and i‐ ‘verbal plural’ either replace
object prefixes (in the case of incompletive a‐) or they merge with the object markers (in the
case of verbal plural i‐).","[66, 67]"

‘While we were fighting, he hit me.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]In (70)b, the subject of the main verb is coreferent with the object of the dependent
clause. This may have to do with the fact that we are dealing with an empty
subject, or possibly a subjectless predicate. The object here indicates the
experiencer. The event is presented and defined from his viewpoint: the moment
of lëjëlë is determined by the moment the experiencer wakes up. This is a crucial
difference with example (72), where the event of raining – also with an empty
subject 27 – happens independently from the experiencer, so that the different
subject marker =ti (cf. section 8.2.4) appears.

‘While walking in the jungle, we were caught by the rain.’ [MV‐26MA‐21]When the predicate lëjëlë does not have an experiencer, the different subject
marker =ti is used:

deli
ti‐chanka=jsha
morning‐FUT‐3=DS fall.SG:1SG.S
1SG‐plank=ABL
‘When it was going to be morning I fell out of bed.’ [RF‐30MA‐6]Another often mentioned characteristic of clause chaining is that there is a fully
inflected verb at the end of a string of verbs. All foregoing verbs are marked for
whether they have a different or the same subject as that final verb. Even though
the dependent =ja clause usually precedes the main clause, this is not obligatory:

agouti grandmother
‘Grandfather Tiri felt sorry for the old agouti when he saw her.’ (AR‐8MI‐47)
There really seem to be subjects with these predicates, considering instances such as the
following:
a. lëjëlë‐ø=ti
seta‐ø=w lëtta shunñe
morning‐3=DS
grab‐3=PL one
man
‘When it was morning they grabbed one man.’ [MV‐26MA‐21]
b. mashi‐ø=ja wilita

Apparently, these empty subjects can trigger same or different subject morphology.
27306The clauseIn comparison to the =ya clauses, the =ja‐marked event is more separable from the
main event. It does not depend on the TMA information of the main clause:

‘When he had picked up the pieces, when he had burned his mother and had
gone, he was going to wait for his brothers. (FA‐6MA‐9)In (75)a the main verb is marked for future tense, the dependent clause is
unmarked for tense. In the case of the =ya clauses both events would take place in
the future relative to the temporal anchor. The translation would be: ‘they were
going to go and meet him’. In (75)b, the main event is marked for intentional, but
the =ja marked dependent clauses are not marked for TMA, and they are not
interpreted as intentional. Whereas the temporal, aspectual and modal
information of the ya‐clause is relative to the TMA information of the main verb,
the situation is different with the ja‐clauses: both the main event and the ja‐clause
have their own independent organization of TMA. Schematically, this can be
represented as follows:
=ya‐marked construction
anchor
XX
dependent clauseX
main clause=ja‐marked construction
anchor
XX
dependent clauseX
main clauseFigure 1 ‐Difference in TMA organization between =ya clauses and =ja clauses
The following construction is somewhat deviant. It is an absolutive construction
with the =ja marker:307A grammar of Yurakaré(76) abliwsha së

jungle=DIR go.SG=SS 1SG‐IO‐look‐JUS‐2SG.S 1SG‐pet dog
‘While I go to the jungle, I want you to watch over my dog.’ [RF‐26MA‐5]This construction is used to make conditional/temporal commands where the
speaker is the subject of the ja‐clause and the main clause entails a command and
has the addressee as its subject. The subject of the ja‐clause is expressed overtly –
in this case by the pronoun së – but does not trigger agreement. The main verb is
fully inflected. Possibly the construction exemplified in (76) can be analyzed as
having an abstract non‐expressed speech event triggering the same subject
marker. It seems that the dependent ja‐clause cannot carry any TMA information
either in this construction. If it does carry TMA markers in a similar construction,
the different subject marker =ti is called for:
(77) sawata‐shti=ti
sawata‐cha‐m
lacha
work‐FUT:1SG.S=DS work‐JUS‐2SG.S too
‘When I am going to work, you should work as well.’ [RF‐30MA‐2]The construction in (76) is quite comparable with the conditional ya‐clauses
discussed in 8.2.2, an example of which is repeated here:
(78) lëtëmë=yj
wita=ya
a‐nënë‐cha‐m
INC‐cook‐JUS‐2SG.S
jungle=DIR arrive.SG=NVR
‘When you arrive in the jungle, cook.’ [MH‐24MA‐6]The only difference between (78) and, for instance, (76)b is that the subjects of the
conditional clause are different in (76)b, while they are the same in (78).
Subordinate clauses marked with =ja are mainly used to encode temporal
adverbial clauses, as has been shown by a number of the examples discussed
above. Because of the fact that the ja‐clause retains all possibilities for TMA
marking and other modification by means of derivational morphology or adverbs,
ja‐clauses can express anterior, simultaneous and posterior events, relative to the
main event. The default temporal interpretation of the ja‐clause is that the ja‐
marked predicate expresses the event that occurred first. However, there are ways
to create a co‐temporal interpretation, e.g. through the use of the incompletive
prefix a‐ on the =ja‐marked predicate in (79)a, or by the phasal adverb kaj in (79)b:308The clause(79) aba‐tiya‐tu=ja

‘not yet’ to form a before‐clause, I have found no such examples in my database.
As mentioned above, the absolutive‐like constructions with =ja discussed above
(i.e. without person marking and TMA in the subordinate clause) can be
interpreted as conditional clauses:

yee=w
a‐tëptë‐ø=w=ja
WH=DIR go.PL‐3=PL

‘Where did the women that were washing go?’ [FA‐32MA‐14]These clauses are formally indistinguishable from adverbial clauses marked with
=ja. They do not seem to be a separate category in Yurakaré. Sentence (82) could
just as easily be translated ‘Where did the women go after washing?’. This is not a

Adverbs can also be derived from verbs, even though this is not a very frequent
process. Usually, verbs that are used as adverbs carry the marker ‐shku:
(69) abpuwa‐shku‐ta
mala‐ø
be.drunk‐ADV.CMP‐MID go.SG‐3
‘He walks like he is drunk.’ [HC‐26MA‐24]
ka‐la‐deche‐shku‐ta 8
bushu‐ø
lie(down)‐3
3SG‐AFO‐meet;find‐ADV.CMP‐MID
‘It seems that he is lying down ill.’ [HC‐26MA‐24]Here too, the verb can retain some of its verbal characteristics, like the applicative
marker and object.
Marginally, adverbs can derive from predicates by means of the suffix ‐sh:
(70) ti‐n‐kukku‐sh
sawatajti
1SG‐IO‐nice‐ADV
work‐HAB:1SG.S
‘I like working.’ [FA‐24MA‐15]Tinkukkush can be seen as a person‐marked adverb meaning ‘with pleasure’.
The suffix ‐ilë on a predicate indicates that the event expressed by the predicate is
characteristic for the agent:
(71) abchitta‐ylë‐m
throw.SG‐CA‐2SG.S
‘You go around throwing stuff away.’ [RF‐30MA‐14]
tiya‐ylë‐ø
eat‐CA‐3
‘He is a glutton.’ [RF‐30MA‐14]According to Day (1980‐23), predicates marked with ‐ilë can be used as nouns. I have
only examples of predicatively used ‐ilë.
The suffix ‐uta denotes the place where some action typically or habitually takes
place, or where something is typically encountered. It is used very infrequently:8The diachrony of kaladeche ‘be ill’ is not clear; it seems to derive from deche ‘meet’.","[222, 223]"
"3.3.1 Nouns
Notional features associated with nouns are concreteness, referentiability (Croft
2003), countability, compactness, time‐stability (Givón 2001a). Words referring to
persons, places and physical objects can be considered to be basic noun concepts
(Schachter 1985).
Even though in Yurakaré it is hard to find morphosyntactic arguments for
headedness within the noun phrase, we can still say that nouns are typically the

"7.3.3 Combinations of expressive enclitics
Here, not all logical possibilities are present in my data either, but I can
supplement my data with the information in Day (1980). Nevertheless, the same
cautionary remark should be made as in the previous section, namely that most
combinations are not very common, and statements about their meaning should
be taken as preliminary and ad hoc.
=la ‘validational’ + =ri/yu ‘expressive’

‘But that is the only one there is!’ (DV‐14MA‐2)
DEM‐MEA‐SPCbThese are actually the only instances that I have found of this combination. In
(76)a, the interpretation seems to be that the speaker is giving an estimate (a
combination of =jtë and =yu), but she is convinced of her estimate. In (76)b, the
speaker tries to convince her husband that he is wrong.
Day (1980) has the following examples. She mentions that these are very
common in preaching.

mentions another use of this combination, to mark astonishment, which I have not
encountered:

‘This is what we eat.’ (OR‐19MA‐20)In (80)a and b the combination =la and =se seems to mark determination or
conviction. In (80)a, which has already been discussed above, the speaker tries to
convince the hearer that something is possible, in spite of the fact that the hearer
thinks otherwise. In (80)b the speaker does not believe her son who said he was
sad for no reason. She thinks there must be a reason. In (80)c, however, the
meaning is slightly different. The speaker has just been telling about the founding
father of the Yurakaré, Tiri, and how he transformed all kinds of animals, so that
the Yurakaré Indians would have food. The utterance in (80)c is explanatory: ‘And
so this is what we eat, you see’.","[278, 279]"
