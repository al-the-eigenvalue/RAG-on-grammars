"The primary particle, nde, is used in all types of negation. Not only is it used as the
primary negation particle, but standing alone it simply means ' no ' . When a question is asked
and the response is negative, a simple nde is sufficient in reply. In contrast, the other negative
particle, yo, is used only in conjunction with nde. So it can be said that nde is indeed the
primary or basic negative particle.
The particle nde is required to form prohibitive sentences, positive-negative alternative
questions and negative equational sentences (ยง8. 1 ).
The secondary particle yo is used in conjunction with the primary particle in the formation
of the following sentence types: negative indicative sentences, negative information-seeking
interrogati ves, negative descriptive sentences, negative location sentences. It is also used in
the negation of subordinate clauses (ยง8.2).
Placement of the negative particles when they occur is invariant: yo always precedes the
predicate, while nde always follows the predicate. The following example illustrates negation
of a simple indicative sentence, where both yo and nde are obligatory:
8 . 1 a.",[143]
"141NEGATION8.4 NEGATION IN WORDS
Abun is a language with very little affixation. As may be expected there are no affixes
used to negate words, as in the case of English, with words such as 'un-happy' and 'dislike ' .
However, there are a number o f verbs that are inherently negative in meaning such as:bari
bagri
barnbrai
bandof
bagwodo not want
do not want to eat
do not want to do something
do not feel comfortable with heights
do not like being tickledBa- could be analysed as a negative prefix, but the roots -ri, -gri, -brai, -ndof and
-gwo do not occur as free morphemes.
These verbs remove the need for the use of the negative particles. Example 8.32a is a
negative indicative sentence. The use of an inherently negative verb (bariwa 'do not want to' ,
a s in example 8.32b), without the negative particles has the same meaning as the
corresponding positive verb used with the negative particles. The use of the inherently
negative verb with the negative particles makes the meaning a positive one, as in 8.32c.

"CHAPTER 8
NEGATIONNegation may take a variety of forms, such as 'negative verbs ' , negative particles or fully
bound deri vational morphemes (Payne 1 985b: 222). According to Payne, the use of negative
particles is the most likely form of negation, as is the case in Abun.
This chapter presents the negation strategy used in Abun. Two particles form the basis of
negation. The primary particle is nde, which is a typical particle, a function word that is
invariant. Consistent with the isolating nature of the Abun language, nde does not vary for
tense, aspect, number or agreement. While nde is primary, a further particle, yo, also
invariant, is used in conj unction with it, mainly in the negation of indicative sentences. These
two particles bracket the predicate. In Abun, whenever two particles are used like this, the
function is to mark the extent of a particular grammatical constituent. Bracketing by a pair of
particles not only is one of the main strategies used in negation, but also is used in the
formation of relative clauses, both restrictive and unrestrictive (see ยง9), as well as
interrogative sentences (see ยง6. 1 ). In most cases of negation, the pair of particles yo . . nde
bracket the predicate to negate Abun sentences.
.","[142, 143]"
"O\MYNQ'v1One of the most striking characteristics of yes/no questions noted by researchers is a
rising-final intonation contour (Sadock & Zwicky 1985: 1 8 1 ). An analysis of the intonation
patterns in Abun yes/no questions reveals the opposite, that is a falling final intonation
contour. The intonation pattern for interrogati ve sentences is the same as that for indicative
sentences. Therefore intonation is not such a significant distinguishing feature of yes/no
questions in Abun as it is in many other languages. Ultan ( 1 978:230) points out that in his
79-language sample, those languages that had prepositions always had a rising terminal1 03MARKED MOODScontour intonation pattern. Abun is clearly an exception to this (see Figures 6. 1 and 6.2 below
which contrast yes/no and confirmative question intonation patterns).
There are three basic systems for short answers to yes/no questions: yes/no,
agree/disagree and echo systems. Abun speakers use a mixture of these systems: an echo
system for positive responses; and a negative particle, nde, for negative responses. They do
not have both positive and negative particles for answering like the English 'yes' and 'no ' ,
but rather they only have the negative particle. When a question such a s that in example 6 . 3 i s
asked, a positive answer would be the echo, 'There is cooked food ' . Frequently such answers
may be shortened even further, a possible response to 6.3 being rna 'there i s ' . A negative
response would require the use of nde 'no ' .","[114, 115]"

3SG1 2.7 NEGATIVE CONJUNCTIONS
The final group of Abun conjunctions all contain the negative particle onde. When a single
clause is negated in Abun it is negated by means of two particles which bracket the verb
phrase. So clause negation has the structure:SUBJECT + yo + VERB PHRASE + nde
But there is another type of negation in Abun which occurs on the level of the complex
sentence. Within a complex sentence whatever is expressed by the first clause can be negated
by means of onde. Onde always occurs together with some other conjunction. These create a
group of conjunctions which are termed 'negative' conjunctions. Sentences that use these
negative conjunctions have the following structure:CLAUSE 1 + onde-CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 2
Semantically this is most basically expressed as 'not clause one, clause two ' . It has been
claimed earlier in this chapter that Abun complex sentences show much influence from
Papuan languages. It is interesting to note that Barai, an unrelated Papuan language, also has
two distinct means of negation. In the words of Foley and Van Valin ( 1 984: 1 92), one of
these ""ba ... negates the entire clause and roughly means 'it is not the case that' .. .it is the only
element that ever follows the verb in heavily verb-final B arai"". The fact that this form has an
equivalent meaning to the Abun onde is another factor which confirms the influence of
Papuan languages on Abun syntax.
Table 1 2 .4 below lists all the negative conjunctions. Fuller explanations and examples of
each are given afterwards.",[236]
"8.5 . 1 THE SCOPE WffiI BOTII NEGATIVE PARTIClES
The scope of negation is readily determined by the use of the linked pair of negative
particles, yo and nde. These two particles bracket the predicate, making the scope of negation
syntactically evident. In Abun the scope of negation, when the linked pair of negative
particles is used, is always encoded as a predicate since the linked particles always and only
bracket a predicate. The subject can never be bracketed by the two negative particles.
Payne ( 1 98Sb: 1 99) points out that subjects are usually context-bound and that contextually
bound elements are removed from the scope of negation. What is actually negated is the
contextually free part of the sentence. This, he says, """".often gives the i mpression that
sentential negation might better be described as 'VP negation ""'. Indeed, this is clearly the
case for Abun because the syntax makes that evident by the way the two particles bracket the
predicate (that is, the VP).
Therefore when both particles are used, the scope of negation excludes the subject. When
we consider a situation where someone is discussing a hunting trip, one might say, 'Isak
killed a pig near the Nai river' . In order to negate this sentence, one would say, 'Isak did not
kill a pig near the Nai river' , as in example 8.33. In this example, the subject, Isak, is not
within the scope of negation because it is contextually bound; that is, Isak ' s actions were
under discussion. It is the relationship between Isak and the ki lling of a pig near the Nai river
that falls within the scope of the negation . The scope of negation when both particles are used
is the predicate, as is evidenced by the position of the two negative particles.
So it is either the action (killing), the object (the wild pig) or the location (by the Nai river)
that could be negated. All three of these fall within the scope of negation. The subject, Isak,
does not. Which constituent is actually being negated in the mind of the speaker would in
most cases be clear from the context.
The shifting of words and phrases from outside to inside the bracketing of the linked pair
of negative particles illustrates that the two particles do in fact determine the scope of
negation. In example 8 .34, if kamdik-kamdik 'every day' is included within the bracket it is
also included within the scope of negation. If it is inside the bracket as in 8 . 34c, then the
frequency of eating fish is also negated. Therefore the meaning changes to ' I do not eat fish
every day' or 'Not every day I eat fish ' , implying that on some days fish is eaten, but not
every day. Example 8.34b has 'every day' outside of the bracket formed by the linked pair of
particles. In this way the action of eating, and the object, fish, are within the scope of
negation, but not the frequency. The temporal word in this case is outside of the scope
negation. In this way the two negative particles delineate the scope of negation, in the sense
that whatever falls between them falls within the scope of negation.",[154]
"10.3 . 1 .2 NEGATION OFCOMPLEX SENTENCES
It has already been shown in regard to negative raising (ยง 1 0.2.5) that a clause can be
shown to be subordinate by the placement of the negative particle nde. If a main clause is to
be negated, the negative particle nde occurs only after any subordinate clause which may be
embedded in that main clause. Example 10.57 (given earlier as 10.53) is an example of this
and has a manipulative verb (verb with -gat suffix) in the main clause.
10.57Men yo
wergat ye- wis
yi
ben-bot suk
I PL NFG force
PERs-kind other do-about thing
We do not force other tribes to do these things.rende.thisNFGExample 10.58 below shows the other type of verb under consideration here, verbs which
may take -wa suffix and where the pattern of negation is the same. The subordinate clause, in
these cases complement clauses which do not have a complementiser, is within the
grammatical scope of the main clause negation.
10.58Men yo
nyu-wa men mu k i
suk-du
I PL NFG fear-TRs I PL go
say NOM-say
We are not afraid to go and tell this story.rende.thisNFGThe syntax of these examples indicates that these types of complement are in fact
subordinate because the final negative particle nde occurs after the complement. In order to
create two separate assertions in Abun, each clause would need to have both negative
particles in the correct positions, using a total of four particles in all rather than the two only
that are used in these examples. The presence and position of only two negative particles here
indicates that only one verb in the sentence has been negated, the verb of the main clause.
Therefore the second clause must be an embedded clause because the position of the second
negative particle nde indicates that this clause is included within the scope of the main clause
negation. Because there are only two negative particles there can be only one sentence here.
Therefore on the basis of the structure of the indicative negative, these complement clauses
are subordinate. 2 525The placement of the final negative particle is also significant in another way. In the simple Abun
clause only aspect particles or interrogative particles may follow the final negative particle.
Therefore a constituent such as 'adjunct' may not follow after the negative particle. Thus the
constituent structure given for these sentences cannot include an adjunct and is limited to the
pattern SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECf .",[192]

NEG8.2 THE USE OFyo
The negative particle y o is used in negative indicative sentences, i nformation-seeking
interrogative sentences, negative descriptive and location sentences and in the negation of
complex sentences. It is never used to negate a sentence by itself, but is always linked with
the primary negative particle nde. These two particles form a linked pair that bracket the
predicate of the sentence. The particle yo always occurs between a subject and predicate. The
word order is rigid.
The use of linked pairs of negative particles is uncommon. However French is a wellยญ
documented example of the use of a linked pair of negative particles, for example, j e
n e. . . suis pas. The first particle n e is the primary particle and then pas i s added. Payne
( 1 985b:224) claims that in the case where such linked pairs of negative particles do occur, the
second particle occurs because there is a strong tendency for a single negative particle to be
reinforced and emphasised by the addition of a second particle. Payne analyses pas as the
added particle that reinforces the negation in French.
By way of contrast, Abun places the primary particle after the predicate, not before as in
French. Also the operation of the secondary particle in Abun is not so much to reinforce the
negation of a sentence as Payne claims of French, but rather to mark the predicate and thus
delineate the scope of negation.",[147]
"Instead of having a number of varied alternatives, a further possibility is to have just two
alternatives, one being the negation of the other. In these cases the first alternative (which is
positive) is followed by bado, while the second alternative is the negative particle, nde,
followed by the yes/no question marker, e. Thus the structure of a positive-negative
alternative question is:
(te) CLAUSE bado nde e
Example 6 . 1 0 illustrates this type of question.",[117]
"8.3 NEGATION IN SUBORDINATE ClAUSES
According to Payne ( 1 985b:240), in many languages the devices which are used for
negating subordinate clauses are different from those used in main clauses. He cites several
examples, including Yoruba, where the main clause negative particle is ko, while the particle
used to negate subordinate clauses is rna. In Abun most subordinate clauses are negated in
the same way as main clauses, the only exception being negative purpose subordinate
clauses, as in English 'lest' (or 'in order that.. .not' ).
For example, in 8.26a the whole sentence is negated. By way of contrast, 8 . 26b illustrates
how the embedded clause itself may be negated, resulting in a different meaning. The same
pair of negative particles is used.
8 .26 a.",[151]
"45MORPHOLOGYAND WORD CLASSESTABLE 3. l 4: PRONOUNS
(NB . Dialect variants of Abun pronouns are represented in the following way: ninlnu.)PersonSingularDual1ji/ye/tatme-ka-wemen2nan/anin-(ka)-wenin/nu3anan-(ka)-wean3fan/momnon-humanPlurali-In addition to the above pronouns, Abun has a reciprocal pronoun, yu, and two reflexive
forms, dakai and wadigan. These modify the appropriate pronoun above and yu. For further
details regarding the distinction between these two see ยง5.2. 1 . The same form of this
pronoun is used for all persons.
The Abun prosentence subclass consists of one member, which i s also the pri mary
negation particle, nde. This word is used to answer questions with a 'no' and, as such, is
equivalent to a negative sentence. Affirmative answers use an echo system rather than a
prosentence (see ยง6. 1 for more details).
There are three members of the interrogative proforms subclass, namely u 'which ' ,
suma 'what' and o t 'how many ' . These forms combine with other words to create
interrogative expressions such as, mo u 'ux: which: where' and kam ot 'day how .many:

"CHAPTER 101 76used in Abun must bracket or enclose the entire verb phrase (in transformational grammar
terms) or predicate (in traditional grammar terms, meaning all the constituents that follow the
subject). Because of this, any subordinate clause that is under the matrix clause is always
included within the grammatical scope of the negation. This means that although it is the verb
of the matrix clause that is being negated, the final negative particle will not occur until after
the subordinate clause. The following example illustrates this, where the subordinate clause is
of the relative type, with the negative particle nde actually occurring after the relative clause
without negating the relative clause itself.

"LOCgardenNEG8.S 1HE SCOPEOF NEGATION
Klima ( 1 964), Reesink ( 1986) and Payne ( 1 98Sb) discuss the scope of negation in terms
of 'constituent' and 'sentential ' . The negation of words or phrases may be called 'constituent
negation' , while the negation of predicates, sentences and more complex sentences has
traditionally been called 'sentential negation ' . These two terms were coined initially in relation
to English. In the sentence, 'John is unhappy' , the negation is defined as 'constituent'
because the negation operates on one part (or constituent) of the sentence; while in 'John is
not happy' , the type of negation is defined as 'sentential ' .
I n Abun the scope o f negation i s usually sentential (or, more precisely, the negation o f the
predicate) and this is syntactically marked by use of the linked pair of negative particles
(ยง8.S . I ). Take, for example, the sentence in example 8.33, a simple negative indicative
sentence where the two negative particles surround the predicate. In this case, the action
(killing), the object (the wild pig) or the location (by the Nai river) all fall within the scope of
negation. The subject (Isak), however, does not fall within the scope of negation here because
subjects are usually contextually bound.",[153]
"10.2.5.1 LEXICAL RESTRICTIONS
The limitation of the predicate types which allow negative raIsmg involve further
restrictions for Abun. Abun, in common with the languages of the Papuan region, does not
have a wide range of single morpheme vocabulary to indicate states of mind. The verbs
'know ' , 'understand' , 'hear' and 'believe' may all be expressed by the one verb jam. The
verb 'believe', which may allow negative raising in some languages, does not exist as a
separate lexicon entry in Abun. Another candidate for negative raising is the verb 'want' . The
process of negative raising changes a matrix clause verb 'want' to the negative 'do not want' .
Although it is possible to change the Abun verb lwa 'want' to yo lwa nde 'not want' , the
more usual practice is to use the inherently negative word barilbariwa 'not want' . Because it
is more common for Abun speakers to use bari rather than yo lwa nde, the possibility of
negative raising does not arise due to the choice of negative strategy taken, namely a negative
word rather than a negative particle.",[187]
"8. 1 .2 POSlTIVE-NEGATIVE ALlERNATIVE QUESTIONS
The primary negative particle is also used in asking positive-negative alternative questions.
The structure of this type is:
S PRED badu nde e?
These questions could be called negative tag questions with a positive-negative alternative,
'Do you want to go back to your wife, or not?' , as in example 8 . 5 where a person is being
asked to make a decision between positive and negative alternatives.

"3.4.5 PARTICLES
There are several subclasses of particles including a topicaliser particle, a particle used for
negation, three aspect, three modal and eight mood particles. The term particle is used to
mean a free form word that does not take any type of inflection. It is an invariant form that
never occurs in an environment where i t could be described as 'bound' .
The topicaliser or focus particle is ana(to), which always occurs after the subject and
before the verb. See ยง4.7.2 for more details about the use of this particle.
There is one negative particle, nde, which occurs after the predicate and before aspect
mood or modal particles. Used on its own it may answer a question in the negative. To form
the indicative negative this particle along with the predicate marker yo form a linked pair of
particles. These particles jointly bracket the constituent 'predicate' . Used in a sentence without
yo, nde makes the mood of the sentence prohibitive. For further details see ยง8.
If a clause includes aspect, modal or mood particles, those particles will always be in
clause-final position in that order. The particles may occur after either the verb, the object, the
indirect object or an adjunct, depending on the constituents of the particular clause concerned.
Also, these particles are not clitics in that the particle takes equivalent phonological stress
along with every other word in the clause.",[57]
"Anyomamonu3PL NEG come LOC house

NEG131CHAPTER 81 32In the above example the predicate ma mo nu is bracketed by the linked pair of particles,
yo follows the subject and precedes the predicate, and nde follows the predicate. If, for
example, the subject of a negative indicative sentence is preceded by yo, this would be
syntactically unacceptable to an Abun speaker. Word order here is rigid. The particles must
bracket the whole predicate, PRED (includes v, 0 and any adj uncts). The subject is never
included within the bracket for reasons discussed under the scope of negation in ยง 8 . 5 .
There are two patterns o f negation found in Abun a s follows:S PRED nde
syo PRED nde
They are unusual and have been documented in only a few languages. In SVo languages
the negative particle normal ly precedes the verb (Payne 1985b:224). One would expect the
particle nde to be preverbal, but instead, in Abun, it is not only postverbal but also postobject
and adjunct. This pattern type, though uncommon, is also found in a few documented
languages such as Bolewa, Ngizim, Angas, Ron, Gisiga, Higi and Tera (Payne 1 985b:226).
Furthermore the second pattern type, where a pair of linked negative particles occur, is
also uncommon. In French a linked pair of particles is used in negation, but this pair brackets
only the verb and its associated clitics, whereas in Abun the linked pair brackets the whole
predicate including object and adjuncts. However, this pattern type is an attested one in some
Chadic languages such as Hausa, Jegu and Sura (Payne 1 985b: 225-226). The difference
with these languages is that their word order is not rigid as in Abun. In Hausa both particles
can move to bracket the constituent that is to be negated, and thereby very neatly indicate the
scope and focus of negation (Schachter 1985:60).
Syntax of negation involving the use ,of nde (ยง 8. 1 ), the use of yo (ยง8 .2), negation in
subordinate clauses (ยง8.3), negation in words (ยง8 .4) and a discussion of the scope of
negation in Abun (ยง8.5) provides an organising framework for the remainder of this chapter.","[143, 144]"
"8 . 1 THE USE OF nde
As indicated earlier, the simplest negative sentence is just the negative reply to a question,'Nde ' . In this section, types of negative structures that require the use of nde without yo are
discussed. These types of structure are: prohibitive sentences, positive-negative alternative
questions, and negative equational sentences.",[144]
"The first o f these particles, yo, is the first particle of a linked pair o f particles, where the
second particle is nde ' NEGATIVE'. Yo occurs only in negative indicative sentences as in
example 5. 1 . For further discussion of this predicate marker and its role in delineating the
scope of negation see ยง8.5.",[78]

In contrast to positive-negative alternative questions, negative interrogative sentences
seeking information require both negative particles, yo and nde, such as in the following
examples:
8. 1 5 a.b.",[148]
"In order for negative raising to take place as has been attempted in example l O.47 , only
one negative particle, -yo-, will move in order to negate the matrix verb nut 'think' . Due to
the structure and word order of complex negative constructions in Abun it is not possible to
shift the second negative particle nde and retain a grammatical sentence. Abun rules of word
order do not allow this. Normally in languages that allow negative raising the means of
negation is syntactically removed from the subordinate clause and 'raised' into the main
clause. Because Abun negation involves the use of two particles, both of these cannot be
'raised' from the complement clause. This structural limitation shows that negative raising is
not possible in Abun.lO.3 EMBEDDED COMPLEMENTS
The second type of complement to be found in Abun does not make use of the
complementiser. For want of a better label we have called these complements 'embedded' .
There are mainly two types of predicate which do not need to have a complementiser: those
which involve desiderative or attitudinal predicates and those which involve some type of
force, that is a manipulative predicate. These semantic distinctions are illustrated by the type
of verb suffix used. Attitudinal predicates make use of the suffix -wa, while those indicating
some sort of force or pressure (manipulative) use -gat. Examples of these verb types which
do not use a complementiser are fwa 'want' , bariwa 'not.want/dislike', nyuwa 'fear' and
nokwa 'worry about' , all being attitudinal predicates, and wergat 'persuade/pressurise' and
krokgat 'annoy/stir up' being manipulative predicates. Other manipulative predicates will be
discussed later in the chapter.
The following examples illustrate these complement types:

Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985: 175) note that a striking feature of negative imperatives is how
differently they are handled from negative declaratives. They say it is quite unusual for the
marks of negation from other sentence types to be added to the imperative formula. Abun
actually takes one of its negative particles used in declarative sentence types and uses it for
making negative imperatives. Negation in declarative sentences is marked by a linked pair of
particles, yo... nde, whereas for negative imperatives nde alone is used. Compare 6.8 1 a with

NEG6.3 FRuSTRATEDACTION
Frustrated action is marked by the particle ware, which syntactically occurs in the same
position as other mood markers, that is as the last among a group of clause-final particles.
Thus we have analysed it as a mood. The particle ware could be translated as 'in vain' , 'to no
avai l ' or 'but without success' . Its meaning is that an action was attempted but the goal of the
action was not achieved. For example:
6.82An

1 . He made a trap for wild pigs but he did not trap any.

NEGIn a similar way the Chadic language, Hausa, syntactically marks the scope of negation by
the use of two negative particles. In that language these particles can move around to bracket
the subject, the predicate or other parts of the sentence. Examples are found in Schachter
( 1 985 :60). However word order is not rigid as it is in Abun. In Hausa, both particles can
move to bracket the constituent that is being negated and thereby very neatly indicate the
scope as well as the focus of negation. Abun ' s use of the linked particles is not as flexible:
because for example, the subject can never be surrounded by the linked pair of particles.
However the subject may be included in the scope of negation as discussed in the next
section.",[155]
"8. 1 . 1 PROHIBITIVE SENTENCES

operators almost always to the verb. However Abun differs markedly from the norm in that
its main NEG-marker, nde, is not attached to the verb, and is frequently distant from the verb,
being one of the clause-final particles. For prohibitive sentences nde is used as in examples
4.30 and 4.3 1 ; but for negative indicatives the predicate (v, 0 and all ADJUNCTS) is bracketed by
two particles, yo and nde, as seen in 4.32 and 4.33. For a more detailed discussion of
negation see ยง8. 1 .",[69]
"CHAPTER 81 44
8.5.2 NARROWINGlHE SCOPE OF NEGAll0NExample 8.33 above does not specify which of the components within the predicate are
being negated. Was it not a wild pig killed? Was it not a killing? Was it not at that location?
All of these components are within the scope of negation . To know which component is
being negated one needs to refer to the context of the discussion. Since negative sentences are
rarely said in isolation, that part which is being negated is usually known from the context.
In English several strategies are used to narrow the scope of negation to the elements of
the sentence or predicate that the speaker wants to negate. These include the use of
phonological devices such as emphatic stress, or syntactic devices such as cleft constructions.
So, for example, the use of intonation to stress components of the sentence is a way to negate
a constituent as in, 'Isak did not eat the RICE (but the fish)' . Or, ' Isak did not EAT the rice
(but he just swallowed it) ' . Alternatively, or in addition, syntactic features may be used to
negate a constituent. Topicalisation, for example, is used in English, 'It was not the rice that
Isak ate ' .
In the same way, Abun, like English, has some syntactic techniques that enable u s to
focus on the negation of a certain part of the sentence. Essentially the constituent to be
negated needs to be bracketed by yo and nde. In order to achieve this the predicate needs to
be transformed so that only one constituent is bracketed by the negative particles. As a result
of limiting the scope of negation, elements within the predicate are topicalised or relativised.
The scope can also be narrowed by a second use of the particle, yo.
Firstly, by topicalising elements of the predicate the scope of negation is narrowed.
Topicalisation of an element removes such an element from the scope of negation, thereby
reducing the number of possibilities to which the negation may apply. So, for example, if the
wild pig in example 8 .37a, is topicalised, it becomes 8.37b, meaning that either the action
(killing) or the location fall within the scope of negation. If, then, the location is likewise
topicalised, as in 8.37c, the result is that either the action or the object falls within the scope of
negation. Also it is possible to front both the object and the location, thereby effectively
narrowing the scope of the negation to the action alone. Thus, in 8 .37d, the wild pig near the
Nai river is under discussion and Isak did not kill it; he must have done something else to it.

NEG8.2.6 1HE INTERACTION OF yo AND nde
In summary, the negation of a sentence with just the primary particle nde means that one
is not allowed or prohibited to do a particular thing, as in example 8 .25b. In contrast to this,
the addition of the secondary negative particle (or predicate marker) yo changes the nature of
the sentence to become simply a negative indicative statement, as in 8.25c.

NEGway badIn both examples 8 .28 and 8 .29 the preposition kadit 'from' , which nonnally pre-empts a
noun phrase, is followed by an embedded clause. Embedded clauses of this nature, when
negated, do not use the secondary negative particle yo since it has been replaced by kadit.
This happens even though they may be of the sentence type that nonnally requires both
negative particles.
A further clarification of negation in subordinate clauses is necessary in the case where a
relative clause in the object position is negated as well as the whole sentence. In such a case
only one nde is required, as in example 8 .30a. This particle fonns the bracket for both the
subordinate clause and the sentence. There are two occurrences of yo in 8.30a, whereas in
8.30b only the relative clause is negated, while in 8.30c the whole sentence is negated.
8.30 a.","[151, 152]"
"NEGexistMen )!Qkuotomen biIn ยง 1 0.2.5 earlier it was shown how a clause can be considered as subordinate by the
placement of the final negative particle nde. If a main clause is to be negated, the negative
particle nde only occurs after any subordinate clause which may be embedded within the
larger sentence. Thus clauses joined by wa are embedded clauses within a l arger sentence. So
in example 1 2.5 above the preposition wa is used to link the clause men bes men bi suk ' we
load our things' to a larger sentence. The placement of the negative particle nde as sentenceยญ
final indicates that this clause is in fact embedded.
The following example i s even more complex. The verb of the main clause is negative
and, as is the case with main clause verbs in Abun, the second negative particle cannot occur
until after any embedded clauses which are governed by the main clause. In this example
there are three embedded clauses, one a relative clause and two that are embedded by means
of wa, showing that wa is also recursive in nature. To add to the complexity the main clause
is also an interrogative. Again, like the final negative particle, the interrogative marker e
occurs after the embedded clauses.

A descriptive sentence is defined as a sentence that attributes an adjective to a noun, for
example 'Musa has a big arm' or 'The book is old' . The behaviour of words that could be
considered adjectives in Abun does not differ greatly from that of verbs. These words can act
as predicates, and so both particles are required to negate these sentence types. In such
sentences the adjectival part of the sentence is negated using the linked pair of yo and nde.

where deception is considered positive, speakers need a way to convince the hearer that they
mean business. So in Abun the modal particle go is used to do this. For example:

For the purposes of this discussion we shall define a verb phrase not as a total predicate,

phrases are defined as consisting of a verb as head, with optional predicate markers and
verbal particles.
Auxiliaries, which carry notions of tense, aspect, mood, modality, polarity and voice, are
not considered as part of the Abun verb phrase since they are separated from the verb, not
only by any object, but also by any adverbs and adjuncts in the sentence. Aspect, mood,
polarity and modality particles can be contiguous with the verb only when there are no
object(s), adverbs or adjuncts. Therefore, for Abun, such particles are not analysed here as
part of the verb phrase, but are considered separately because they operate on the clause level.
They are discussed separately in ยง6, ยง7, and ยง8.",[77]

Free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases which express time or location are free from the

Onde should not be understood as a negative conditional such as the English ' unless ' . It is
possible to give an alternative translation for example 1 2.83 above as 'Unless you sweep up
that mess down there, you won't get any biscuits ! ' However, as seen in examples 1 2.77 and
1 2.78 above, which use onde-wo, onde does not always have the meaning of a negative
conditional. When used as part of onde-wo it has the meaning of negative contrast. Usage of
onde indicates some kind of semantic contrast between the propositions involved. This i s

(iv) onde-bere 'otherwise.cERT'
This conjunction differs from the others by the addition of the time word bere
'FlITURFfIater' . There are several variants of bere which need to be explained. These three
variants concern the differences in the way Abun speakers view future time. These variants
are:ber
bere
besoon, shortly
later, definitely๏ฟฝwill
later, likely/probably๏ฟฝ couldAll these variants could be translated as 'later' or 'will' in regards to future time. Ber is
used to indicate that the future time specified is in the near future. However, with bere and
be the matter of future time proximity is unspecified. What is specified is the degree of
certainty that the speaker attaches to the future event described. Hence, if the speaker feels
that the event is a certainty then bere is used, meaning 'definitely will ' . If the speaker
attaches less certainty to the future event taking place then be is used, meaning 'probably
will' or 'could'. Both these time words can be joined to onde to create counterfactual
conjunctions. These conjunctions link events that are non-past or future time in the same way
as the conjunction onde-yo. By choosing onde-bere or onde-be rather than onde-yo the
speaker adds the semantic element of 'degree of certainty' which is not present in the case of
onde-yo. In regard to counterfactuals Givon ( 1 990: 832) notes that ""many languages allow
further gradation, most particularly of events/states that are j udged to be unlikely but not
altogether impossible"". The gradations referred to here are from possibly true to not true.
The gradation expressed in Abun is in the other direction, from probable to certain . Abun has
no adverb or modal form which means 'definitely' or 'certainly' . Thus these concepts have
been incorporated into these future time words. Examples showing the use of onde-bere and
onde-be are given below:229PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS1 2.84Nan ma

"8.2. 1 NEGATNE INDICATIVE SENTENCES
The basic structure of a negative indicative sentence is:syo PRED nde
Whatever elements are within the predicate (such as verb, object, any adj uncts, and
embedded clauses), all are bracketed by the pair of particles, yo and nde. Irrespective of
whether the sentence is intransitive, transitive or ditransitive, yo remains constant in both
form and position. Likewise, nde remains constant in form and position. Each of these
sentence types is illustrated in the examples below:
8. 1 2 a.",[147]

The negative meaning of onde can be clearly understood when it is part of the contrastive

following way:
CLAUSE 1

reallaltemative eventondenot the case, insteadThe event expressed by clause one is stated positively; it is not marked as negative within the
clause by means of the negative particles yo and nde. However, whatever was asserted by
clause one is not the case, and so this clause is negated by means of onde. Therefore the
event expressed by clause two is, in the speaker' s opinion, the real situation. If the clause i s
linked b y a negative conj unction other than ondewo, the event expressed b y clause two
indicates an alternative situation to that expressed in clause one. Thus ondewo links clauses
expressing a false and true contrast. For example:

(ii) onde-sa 'otherwise (would)'Onde-sa is made up of the sentence negator onde and the realis or past time conjunction
sa. The combined meaning of the two creates a conjunction that is counterfactual. Again the
structure of the sentence using onde-sa is broken down semantically below to explain clearly
the meaning of these types of sentences.
CLAUSE 1
event assertedonde-sa
(if) not so, insteadCLAUSE 2
different outcome, pastThe event expressed by clause one is given in the indicative. These events may or may not
be true. The second clause describes a situation that would arise in the event that clause one
was negated. Onde represents the negation. Sa indicates a past time setting to both the event
and the outcome described. In this type of sentence both the event and the outcome may refer
to hypothetical situations. Even so, sa indicates that whether hypothetical or not the events in
question would have occurred at some time in the past, rather than in the future. In these
sentences onde links clauses in a counterfactual manner giving the meaning: 'If the events
expressed by clause one had not happened then the events expressed by clause two would
have ' . Since Abun has no English equivalent to the conditional 'if' , this meaning is merely
for the purposes of good translation. However ""Counter-fact propositions need not beCHAPTER 12226associated with conditional ADY clauses."" (Giv6n 1 990:83 1 ), as is the case here. That is to
say, a counterfactual proposition does not need to be marked by overt conditional means
only. A language may use other means to indicate this. For example:
1 2.79Su-gane men ku
with-that 1 PL meetRon onde-sa,
Ron otherwise-REALmen yo

1 . At that time we met Ron, otherwise we would not have had money to come

2. If, at that time, we hadn't met Ron we would not have had money to come
here.
In the sentence above clause one expresses a factual situation which did actually
occur-the participants met a man who gave them money. Clause two expresses a
hypothetical situation which would have arisen if they had not received the money-they
would not have been able to pay for fares to return to their village. The usage of sa indicates
to hearers that this speculation i s about past events. Example 1 2.80 below i s similar. It
contains the variant onde-sor-sa. This adds a component of meaning similar to 'it was j ust as
well that...'

2. It was good that they set up a shaman training school at Aiwom. It was good
in that the shamans didn ' t kill each other any more. B ut if not they would
still be killing each other.yuIn the preceding two examples the meaning component that sa adds to these clauses is
that of its primary meaning-it is functioning as a tensed conjunction indicating past time.
The following example differs from 1 2 .79 and 1 2.80 above in that here sa is functioning
according to its secondary usage-it adds the notion of 'subjunctive' to the first clause. Abun
has no lexical equivalent to the subjunctive 'should' . Therefore the translation of 1 2. 8 1 below
indicates this.

such it could also be translated a s 'Would that you had all rowed that canoe' . This also is227PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONSsubj unctive. It expresses a wish or desire that past events could have occurred in a better
way.46 As such this clause refers to a hypothetical past event. What actually happened in this
case was that one young man was left to row the canoe alone against a strong wind.'
Because Abun has no morpheme to represent a hypothetical situation such as the English
'if' , it is only by context and knowledge of the events described that hearers encode what is
hypothetical and what is fact. The function of onde is to negate the contents of the preceding
clause. On its own it does not attach truth value to these clauses. Therefore when onde is part
of the conj unction onde-wo, it is used to express the semantic notion of 'contrary to
expectation ' . When part of the conjunctions onde-sa and onde-yo, onde i s used to express
the notion of 'contrary to fact' .
(iii) onde-yo 'otherwise (will)'Onde-yo differs in meaning from onde-sa in the matter of time setting only. In clauses
linked by onde-sa, the 'tensed' conjunction sa indicates to hearers that the time setting of the
sentence and its contents are in the past, events described therein have already occurred.
However, when the conj unction changes to yo, hearers understand that the event expressed
by the second clause is non-past. These events have not actually occurred and may be
hypothetical in nature also.

Givon ( 1990: 8 3 1 ) makes the following comments about counterfactual conditionals
which are relevant to this discussion of negative conjunctions.
In addition to the subordinators that (may) mark them, counterfact clauses tend
to be marked, cross-linguistically, by a combination of two semantically
conflicting verbal inflections:
(a) A prototypical realis operator, such as past, perfective or perfect: and,
(b) A prototypical irrealis operator, such as: future, subjunctive, conditional
or a modal.
According to Givon this 'semantic conflict' arises if a clause is marked with both a realis
and irrealis 'operator' or one clause may be marked realis and the other irrealis. This situation
may arise as given in example 1 2.83 below. The first clause is marked by the perfect aspect
marker reo However, the usage of onde-yo in sentences is very similar to the usage of the46Just as Abun has no word for the modal 'should' neither does it have an equivalent to the
subjunctive verb 'wish' . The subjunctive usage of sa is the nearest Abun equivalent for expressing
this notion.","[236, 237, 238, 239]"
"7. 1 ASPECT
The notion of aspect, according to Comrie ( 1 976: 1 -3), tends to be a less familiar notion to
students of linguistics than other terms for verbal categories. In order to define the term, he
firstly distinguishes it from tense. He points out that ""aspects are different ways of viewing
the internal temporal constituency of a situation"". Lyons ( 1 968:3 1 5) also distinguishes tense
from aspect by noting that tense has to do with the location in time of an action or state,
whereas aspect has to do with the distribution of time or contour of an action or state. He
claims that the main aspectual notions of 'completion' and 'duration' are found in many
languages.
Abun uses particles to express aspectual notions. The notion of 'completion ' is expressed
by two particles, re and it, while the notion of 'incompleteness' is expressed by the particle
to. When these optional particles occur, they follow negative markers, where present, but
precede mood and modality particles.",[134]
"2324CHAPTER 3The second index that Comrie discusses is the index of fusion, which measures the extent
to which morphemes within the word are readily segmentable, with the extremes being
agglutination and fusion. The few affixes which occur in Abun are easily segmentable. There
is some slight variability of morpheme shape predictable in terms of general phonological
rules discussed in ยง2.5. Abun, then, has an agglutinating morphology within its relatively
small amount of polymorpherruc words. Very little fusion is evident.
Comrie ( 1 989:46ff.) discusses several languages in relation to the index of fusion
including Turkish, Hungarian and Russian. Turkish is relatively agglutinating, Hungarian
exhibits more fusion, and Russian even more fusion again. Abun, however, is more like
Turkish in that it is close to the agglutinating end of the continuum.
Therefore, Abun is an isolating language, mostly monosyllabic. In the few cases of
affixation and word compounding that do occur, the morphemes are easily segmentable.
The implications of very little affixation in Abun are that other strategies are required to
effect what is normally achieved through affixation. For example, in many languages
affixation on the head of a noun phrase defines grammatical relations. However, in Abun,
word order alone defines core grammatical relations, while prepositions are used with
obliques. Number is expressed with a classifier and a number word, rather than an affix.
Possession is not marked with an affix, but instead a linker is used between the possessor
and the possessum.
Very little affixation occurs on Abun verbs. Instead of person/number agreement affixes
on verbs, only free form pronouns are used. While other languages in the West Papuan
Phylum have both free pronorrunal forms and person/number prefixes on verbs, including
the most closely related language, Maibrat, Abun does not. Time adverbs, temporal
prepositional phrases and some conjunctions indicate notions of time normally carried by
tense affixes. Polarity, aspect, mood and modality are conveyed by the use of particles, not
by affixation on verbs as is common in Papuan languages (Foley 1 986).
The processes of word-building in Abun are therefore rather lirruted. The following
processes are evident: lirruted suffixation on verbs (ยง3 . 3 . 1 ) ; three prefixes for nouns (ยง3.3.2);
word compounding, principally in nouns (ยง3.3 .2); and some adjectives are used as manner
adverbs (ยง3.3.3 and ยง3.3 .4).","[35, 36]"

'negative conjunctionsBesides these temporal notions there is a particle in Abun which can behave similarly to a switch
reference particle. The particle ga is used to identify the second actor or participant in a narrative.
Since Abun is not a clause-chaining language it is not absolutely necessary to overtly mark the
'second actor' . It is the authors' opinion that this is a Papuan language feature which has
influenced Abun grammar. The particle ga is discussed earlier in Chapter 5 (ยง5.2.2).",[204]

Secondly, in order to narrow the scope of negation to the modifier of a noun head of the
subject, the predicate of the sentence may be relativised to become embedded within the
subject position, with the modifier becoming the negated predicate. Take, for example, the1 45NEGATIONmodifier of the head of the noun phrase, rnwa 'man y ' , in example 8 . 3 8a. Sentential negation
of 8.38a is shown in 8 . 3 8b. But to narrow the scope of negation to the constituent, rnwa, a
structural change is made to form 8.38c, where the item to be negated, rnwa alone is
bracketed by yo and nde. To achieve this, the predicate of 8.38b is relativised to become part
of the subject and rnwa then behaves as a predicate and can be negated with the linked pair of
negative particles, as in 8 .38c.
8 . 3 8 a.","[156, 157]"
