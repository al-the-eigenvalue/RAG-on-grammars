"194DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHSome verbs, such as urḑ ""sth. is good"", are found in both ad hoc and lexicalized forma­
tions.
6.4
The modal verb construction
Modalities are expressed in Nivkh either in auxiliary or complement constructions, with
suffixes, or in a construction which originated in verb root serialization. The latter form
is typical for deontic modality, and more specifically for negative modality and negation
itself in the Amur variety (whereas complement-taking modal verbs are both affirmative
and negative). It is fully productive and formed ad hoc, and the first verb root is not
subject to any restrictions. The modal verbs take the position of the second root. The
modals are (cf. Krejnovic 1934:217-218,1979:317; Panfilov 1965:105,156-163; Otaina

modal, viz. -ami- ""want"" (see (51)), which takes a complement in the Amur dialect, see

"COMPLEX NOUN FORMS271Support for the idea of a poly synthetic noun comes from old sources: In drawing a di­
stinction between incorporation and poly synthesis, Hewitt (1893:392) cites an article by
Brinton (1885) stating that ""polysynthesis is a method of word-building, applicable
either to nominais or verbals"", and adds from the same source (1893:398)
As polysynthetic elements we have the inseparable possessive pronouns which
in many languages are attached to the names of the parts of the body and to the
words for near relatives; also the 'generic formatives', particles which are pre­
fixed, suffixed, or inserted to indicate to what class or material objects belong;
also the 'numeral terminations' affixed to the ordinal numbers to indicate the
nature of the objects counted; the negative, diminutive, and amplificative
particles which convey certain conceptions of a general character,*** but are
generally not words themselves, having no independent status in the language.
This statement addresses some of the ingredients we have termed 'modificational suffi­
xes' in section 9.1 of this chapter, as well as classifiers on the noun. In one of the oldest
articles on polysynthesis, Duponceau (1819:xxvii) says about ""the polysynthetic form of
language"" that there are a ""great number and variety of ideas which it has the power of
expressing in one single word; particularly by means of the verbs"", i.e. not exclusively
in the verb.
One argument for the rejection of a polysynthetic noun, even if not uttered expli­
citly, is surely the holophrastic idea of polysynthesis which postulates that a polysynthe­
tic expression must be predicative and must represent a full clause, including its partici­
pants. Nouns, on the other hand, are usually seen as connected to referential and argu­
ment functions.
Two objections may be made to this idea. First, there are languages which have
highly complex verb forms integrating all sorts of concepts, but no person-marking, and
which therefore are not complete clauses without free personal pronouns, as we saw in
chapter 7.1. They force us to accept the existence of non-holophrastic polysynthesis any­
way: if verbs need not be polypersonal, then nouns need not be either.
The second objection is based on the fact that complex nouns may well function
as predicates without a copula and thus constitute a minimal sentence on their own, e.g.
in Nivkh (as we saw in chapter 8.7) and in Greenlandic (cf. Fortescue 1984:70, 72, 79).
Of course, if polypersonalism is considered a necessary condition for polysynthesis, then
the nature of person marking on the complex noun becomes a crucial point.
Still, complex nouns are generally less complex than complex verbs and also
different in structure. Complexity of the noun and the verb are not interdependent: there
are polysynthetic verb languages without complex nouns, e.g. Karok (Bright 1957),
Blackfoot (Algonquian; Taylor 1969), Atsugewi (Palaihnihan; Mithun 1999:470-471),
Paumari (Arawan; Chapman/Derbyshire 1991), and Tiwi (Non-Pama-Nyungan; Osborne
1974), and there are languages with highly complex nouns and rather simple verb forms,
e.g. Sanskrit and German. So we might want to have a separate term for complex headmarking noun forms which mark at least a possessor and modificational concepts, such
as those in Greenlandic, Tariana, and Chukchi.","[281, 282]"
"The example forms show that -mas- attaches to the -/-stem (or root of vocalic verbs) to
yield a parallel construction to verb root serialization, with the i being an epenthetic
vowel on consonantic verb roots which brings about the open syllable form characte­
ristic of Japanese. Modality, converb suffixes and serialized roots are attached to this -istem. The non-past tense suffix -u following -mas- comes from the verbal paradigm, and
is also triggered by the (non-extant) source verb. The negational suffix, on the other
hand, follows the -a-stem, to which suffixes for the causative, passive, and irrealis are
attached (which gives rise to my term 'non-control stem'). It triggers the adjectival nonpast suffix, as does its (still extant) source. If negation and honorative are to be com­
bined, however, -mas- triggers the special negational suffix -en, which does not occur in
any other context. Thus, there is evidence for a grammaticalization out of a verb root se­
rial construction in Japanese.
In Japanese, we also encounter full verbs in the second verb root position in se­
rialization which both recur in lexicalized formations and have been grammaticalized,
parallel to Nivkh -jiki-, e.g. kakeru ""attach"" and dasu ""take out"". In the example below,
they are combined with hanasu ""speak"" and warau ""laugh"".

the polysynthetic verb form in the form of optional suffixes. The morphemes number in
the hundreds and have quite concrete meanings, but a lexical source cannot be recon­
structed for them (see Fortescue 1992a:245). Here are some suffixes, including the se­
mantic domains Nivkh expresses with verb root serialization and modals:THE VERB + VERB COMPLEX(66)Greenlandic

-lluar""well, a lot""
""be easy to""
-jurtur""one after another""
""be good at""
-galuar- (contrary to expectance)In light of these phenomena, we imagine that Nivkh modals started out as second roots
in a serial root construction, lost connection to their sources to different degrees (we do
not know how old the different modals are) and underwent further changes until some
reached a state comparable to the Greenlandic non-root bound morphemes. The greatest
formal change has occurred in -yzu-, the negative experiential and negative habitual. It
has lost phonological substance and become bound in comparison to its source verb
j-әyzu-a1 ""s.o. ignores sth."", and it has developed its own allomorphy -yzu- ~ -ksu- ~ -xsu(in line with the usual consonant alternation and parallel to the completive -yet-, for
example).
In terms of semantics, there is a change from jdyzua1 ""ignore"" via ""not know how
to V"" (with a verbal complement) to Negative Experiential (""never have V-ed"") and fi­
nally to Negative Habitual. In East Sakhalin, it is even close to a simple negation marker.
Compare the following examples illustrating the different meanings:

TABLE 1.9: Suffixes on the 4-formBesides by mood suffixes, the last position of a Nivkh verb form may alternatively be
occupied by a scalar operator or focus suffix attaching to the verb stem (see table 1.10).
They are distinguished from mood here because they are identical in form to suffixes of
the nominal paradigm.
Note that question and highlighting focus markers are attached to both the verb
stem and the finite ḑ-form. The difference in semantics is not easy to pinpoint (cf. Krejnovič 1979:315).","[30, 31, 32, 33]"
"TABLE 1.3: Nivkh relational morphemes
Scalar operator suffixes and focus suffixes, which are next in the template, are two cate­
gories which are not differentiated nor addressed in detail in the extant Nivkh grammars.
Their allomorphs are triggered by the final sound of the preceding inflectional suffix in
the same way allomorphs of other inflectional suffixes are. They are mutually exclusive
in the final slot of the nominal word form, but are distinct categories. We will return to
this distinction in chapters 3.8.1,4.3, and 8.3. Suffice it here to say that (i) up to two sca-INTRODUCTION11lar operators may be chained, while at most one focus suffix occurs in a noun form, and
(ii) focus suffixes never occur within a word complex, only at its right edge. Both scalar
operators and focus suffixes, however, may also be marked on adverbial particles, as in
nav-at ""just now"", ñřak-veřk ""only once"" (cf. Gruzdeva 1997b: 169), and on converbs
(for examples see Krejnovič 1934:216). The scalar operators are shown in table 1.4:
-an""also""-park ~ -vark ~ -bark""only""-para ~ -vara ~ -bara""still, yet""-ti ~ -ri ~ -di (A), -ţiŋ ~ -ziŋ ~ -diŋ (ES)

These suffixes fit into the category which König (1991) has termed 'focus particles', but
in order to prevent possible confusion with the Nivkh focus suffixes, a distinctive term
has been chosen here.
The focus suffixes (table 1.5) encode focus values as established by Dik et al. (1981).

"Non-root bound morphemes with 'quite lexical meaning' are understood to be affixes
with meanings which would be expressed by independent forms, especially lexical roots,
in more analytic languages. Polypersonalism, in conjunction with the discussion in chap­
ter 7.1 and in line with Boas (1911a) and Drossard (1997), is not considered a necessary
condition here. A language with TAM, polarity markers, polypersonalism and valencerelated morphology on the verb is not considered polysynthetic if no other categories
from the catalogue can be marked on the verb.
When examining languages which fulfill these criteria we observe that quite dif­
ferent sets of criteria apply out of the pool of ingredients and that the categories in (3),
such as central participants, instrument, quantification, location/direction/motion, moda­
lity, manner, chronology, and phase, may be encoded in basically two different forms:
either as lexical morphemes, which are understood to be roots, i.e. forming word forms
on their own outside of a larger complex, or as non-root bound morphemes. Participants
(except person marking), classifiers, instruments, and location encoded by non-root
bound morphemes on a lexical verb root are usually termed 'lexical affixes' or 'fieldaffixes'.
Lexical morphemes, depending on the number of lexical categories that are di­
stinguished in a language, may be nominal, verbal, adjectival stems, adverbs or even adpositions. In most of the languages in question, however, only noun and verb roots seem
to be involved. The morphological and phonological integration of a (lexical) noun root
into a verb complex then is known as noun incorporation (cf. Gerdts 1996). The morpho­
logical and phonological integration of an additional verb root into a verb complex cor­
responds to verb root serialization (see Bisang 1995).
At this point, it is important that an essential distinction be drawn. Noun incor­
poration and verb root serialization are phenomena which are independent of one
another and of poly synthesis. Languages that have either
(i)
noun incorporation alone (e.g. Danish, Dutch and Frisian (Weggelaar 1986)) or
(ii)
verb root serialization alone (e.g. Yamphu (Kiranti; Rutgers 1998), Yuchi
(North America; Mithun 1999:571-573))
without further polysynthetic traits included in the above-mentioned catalogue (e.g. locational affixes) are not considered polysynthetic. Noun incorporation and verb root seria­
lization contribute to the polysynthetic character of a language, however, and it seems
that most noun incorporating languages are indeed polysynthetic, since non-polysynthetic noun incorporating languages are not so easy to find.
The third possibility, languages with both noun incorporation and verb root se­
rialization, is more difficult to decide on, as both mechanisms together lead to fairly278DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHcomplex verb forms, even leaving the additional criteria aside. Yucatec Maya, for in­
stance, manifests noun incorporation, polypersonalism and suffixes for aspect and va­
lence-changing categories, but quantificational, chronological or manner material seems
to-be integrated into the verb via verb root serialization only (or possibly via adjective
incorporation), not in the form of affixes (cf. Blair 1964:65, Bricker/Po?ot Yah/Dzul de
Po?ot 1998). According to the criteria in (3), Yucatec is a borderline case. It lacks nonroot bound morphemes with fairly 'lexical' meaning, but verb root serialization may be
considered a sort of compensation for that, as categories out of the catalogue (quantifica­
tion, manner, chronology) are expressed this way.
Swedish is a similar case, with noun and adjective incorporation as well as verb
root serialization. Adjectives integrated into the verb form also express degree and chro­
nology.

Krejnovic assumes too much synthesization, e.g. in the case of coordination. This is cor­
rectly criticized by Panfilov (1954) and is implemented by Krejnovic in his later publica­
tions. Some of his earlier errors are detected with the help of the principles of consonant
alternation.

and 40% of the relational morphemes; in both cases, however, this comprises 100%) of
the suffixes that, due to their initial sound, can alternate at all. With verbal morphology,
about 45% of the suffixes show either alternation or traces of it, which is equal to 15%
of all suffixes with initial sounds that can alternate. The greater part of these 75% have
two or three allomorphs typical of alternation: one with a voiced fricative initial and one
with a voiceless plosive initial (30%); another 21% have one voiced and one voiceless
plosive-initial allomorph; and the rest (18%) are represented by only one invariable mor­
pheme with a voiced plosive-initial sound (i.e. a sound occurring as the result of nasal al­
ternation).
Verb suffixes with a voiced and a voiceless plosive-initial allomorph behave like
(plosive-initial) nouns following their verbal attribute in a verb + noun complex in that
the voiceless initial of the noun or of the inflectional suffixes is triggered by a final
voiceless obstruent sound of the preceding verb root.

For the indicative/nominalizing morpheme -ḍ ~ -ţ and the causative morpheme -gu- ~

elides in the Amur dialect, and as the participle suffix is also used for nominalizing, e.g.
in ES umlaŋ ""snake"", literally ""malicious one"", the voiced initial suffixes might be inter­
preted in the following way: historically, nominal morphology was attached to the parti­
ciple, the final sound of which triggered the post-nasal allomorph before eliding, and the
whole was subsequently reanalyzed as a simple verb form. If this assumption is correct,82DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHthe modern initial voiced sound of the suffixes mentioned would be a result of consonant
alternation, too.
All in all, consonant alternation is characteristic of nominal morphology but
much less so of verbal morphology. This can be explained diachronically.
3.3.1 Diachronic perspective on morphophonemics
For quite a number of case suffixes, relational morphemes, scalar operators, as well as
for modality, negation, and aspectoid suffixes, we can speculate about a lexical source
in the form of a noun or verb. Panfilov presents sources for the instrumental case (1962:
146), for the terminative (1962:143) and for most of the relational morphemes (1962:
147-156,1974a:82-85). A consultation with the dictionary (Savel'eva/Taksami 1970) and
of Otaina (1978:39-40, for verbal derivatives) made it possible to augment this list,
presented below. If the presumed relationship is true then some grammatical morphemes
exist alongside their source nouns or verbs from which they have split off.

""look, father is downriver""213All aspects of complexity of a Nivkh verb form and all parameters of polysynthesis
tested so far lead us back to the original structural principle in Nivkh, namely dependenthead synthesis. It is from the dependent-head synthesis of lexical morphemes that Nivkh
draws its complexity, and this principle is actually superordinate to aspects of incorpora­
tion and polysynthesis.
7.4
Role of morphology
Morphology plays a more prominent role in polysynthetic languages than syntagmatic
rules on the clause level, as word forms are highly complex and encode syntactic rela­
tions within them. From a syntagmatic perspective, however, these word forms tend to
be controlled by pragmatics rather than by syntax. This is especially true of languages
like Cayuga in which, except for particles and some simplex 'nouns', all word forms are
predicative (cf. Sasse 1993:203-204), and their interrelations in discourse entities which
are translated as sentences into English are clause-like, not constituent-like.
Polysynthetic languages, e.g. in the Americas, are head-marking (in the sense of
Nichols 1986), contain a rich inventory of non-root bound morphemes, such as Greenlandic (Eskimo; see Fortescue 1980), Klamath (see Barker 1964), Slave (Athapaskan;
see Rice 1989), Tarasco (see Foster 1969), Capanawa (Panoan; see Loos 1999 ms.).
These affixes tend to have fairly concrete meanings, represented by lexical morphemes
in more analytic languages (compare e.g. the semantics of the Greenlandic suffixes,
Fortescue 1980:274-278; see (66) of chapter 6.4 and table 9.1 of chapter 9.1). Further­
more, the already weak distinction between derivational and inflectional morphology in
polysynthetic languages is further blurred by the fact that obligatory categories are
marked closer to the root than derivational ones (Fortescue 1994:2601).
Nivkh is a head-marking language, in line with Fortescue's postulation about
polysynthetic languages (1994:2601, point (i)), but not a non-configurational one. The
asymmetry between the free subject constituent and the synthesizing object, together
with the fact that undergoer marking is obligatory and that the non-discontinuous objectverb-complex is permuted, questioned and substituted as a whole (see chapter 3.8), are
good arguments in favor of the existence of a VP and of configurationality. Configurationality contradicts Fortescue's postulation (h) (1994:2601), but as the combination of214DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHhead-marking and configurationality is obviously rare cross-linguistically1 (cf. Van Valin 1985:406 vs. 1987:380), it is conspicuous in itself, not only in relation to polysynthesis.
Interestingly, Nivkh exhibits exactly (see chapters 2, 3.8, 4.1) the ""productive
morphophonemic processes resulting in several allomorphs (phonological shapes) for
both lexical stems and bound morphemes"", Fortescue's criterion (g) for polysynthesis
traits (1994:2601; cf. also Mithun 1988:442). In this, Nivkh resembles, for instance,
Greenlandic.
As opposed to languages such as Greenlandic and Klamath, Nivkh has a compa­
ratively small set of non-root bound morphemes, viz. for aspectoid (seven suffixes), de­
gree (three suffixes), modality (eleven suffixes), scalar and focal (at least seven suffixes
on the verb root), as well as numeral (five suffixes) and locational categories (twelve
morphemes), but these affixes do fulfill the criterion of having a ""fairly concrete
meaning"" (cf. chapters 1.3.4, 6.4). Besides, they outnumber the corresponding category
of suffixes in Chukchi, see chapter 10.2.1.
An entanglement of derivation and inflection in Nivkh is due in part to the suffix
-ḑ. This suffix is basically found in three contexts:
(i)
on predicative verb forms ('indicative');
(ii)
for the nominalization of verbs, both for the productive formation of comple­
ment forms and as lexicalized nouns; and
(iii)
on deictic roots, forming lexicalized demonstratives, and on personal pronouns,
forming possessive pronouns.
The use of the indicative ḑ -form as the most common matrix predicate form is wellknown to us by now. Turning to point (ii), clausal complements are exemplified in (114)
- (122) of chapter 4.3 and in (39) - (40) of chapter 8.4 in the subject and undergoer func­
tions. Here is a peripheral one:

The verbal nominalized form is formed fully productively and is systematically ambi­

plement clause, however, the inflectional potential is restricted to the suffixes listed in
table 1.9 of chapter 1.3.4, while additional non-nominal suffixes are possible on matrix
forms.","[224, 225]"

head of a phrase and followed by a constituent of the same phrase, e.g. the noun head of
a NP followed by a modifier or determiner, the verbal head of a VP followed by a com­
plement, or the preposition of a PP (Odden 1987).

(kįkóloombe

seems to be that they are defined with respect to a word boundary (Hooper 1976:17,
Clayton 1981, see e.g. the contributions in Andersen 1986). This introduces the first re­
levant parameter, viz. the domain in which sandhi applies. Sandhi phenomena have been
described in domains ranging from the word via the phrase to the sentence and even
across sentence boundaries (such as the English linking-r, Vogel 1986).
If we restrict sandhi to a morphophonemic process applying across a word boun­
dary, as Ternes (1986:14-16) proposes, the identification of word boundaries must pre­
cede the recognition of sandhi. For Nivkh this would mean that we would have to prove
independently where the word boundaries are. The question still remains though: which
boundaries count, the phonological word boundaries or the morphological ones?
The original phenomenon for which the term 'sandhi' was coined in Sanskrit is
observed both within words as well as across word boundaries, known as internal and
external sandhi (cf. Ternes 1986:11). The actual processes consist of different pheno­
mena such as voicing or vowel hiatus elimination, but are largely identical for internal
and external sandhi (Bucknell 1994:5). Furthermore, the fact that identical sandhi pro­
cesses occur both within a word and across a word boundary is not unique to Sanskrit:
this also occurs with, for instance, the English linking-r (Vogel 1986) and Italian Gorgia
Toscana (Nespor/Vogel 1982:238). Phenomena such as these seem to have inspired
Basbøll's claim that the ""boundaries surrounding a non-phonologically defined word
have no special status with respect to sandhi"" (1986:24).
With this in mind, the status of Nivkh complexes remains hard to determine,
since the consonant alternations in Nivkh apply, as we saw in sections 3.3 and 3.3.1, at
inflectional boundaries, i.e. word-internally, as well. Nivkh cannot be said to lack a
phonetic word boundary, as Ternes (1986:20) proposes for Spanish with respect to its
voicing of any intervocalic stops. The final devoicing of fricatives and the restriction to
initial clusters of at most two consonants establishes such a phonetic word boundary in
Nivkh. The boundaries between the elements of complexes could thus be word-internal,
paralleling inflection, or could be found between words. In the latter case, consonant
alternations would be sandhi occurring both word-internally and across word bounda­
ries, but only across 'words' without finite or case inflection and in a syntactically welldefined relation to one another. These relations roughly define domains which are
phrases in European languages. Otherwise there are not any morphophonemic processes96DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHin Nivkh occurring in domains larger than the complex, e.g. after discourse markers,
case-marked nouns, mood-marked verbs, converbs, between subject and predicate, or
between adverbials and anything preceding or following them. This is worth noting if it
is taken into account that sandhi phenomena which have been described as applying
within phrases, e.g. Italian raddoppiamento sintattico, also occur across phrases (see
Nespor/Vogel 1986:38-40,165-174). Suspending a conclusion for the moment, we turn
to further parameters describing sandhi phenomena.
A second parameter concerns the obligatoriness of morphophonemic processes.
Both obligatory processes, such as Sanskrit sandhi, as well as register-dependent (e.g.
English linking-r, Vogel 1986:60pp) or speech rate-dependent ones are subsumed under
the term sandhi. One sandhi phenomenon can even be both obligatory and optional
under different conditions, e.g. French liaison (see below) or Danish nasal alternation,
which is obligatory on the syllabic and morphemic levels, but register-dependent on the
utterance level (Basbøll 1986:23). In Nivkh, all morphophonemic processes are obligato­
ry, and not dependent on the speaker or the occasion.
Further, sandhi may be conditioned phonologically only, as in Sanskrit, where
it applies in any syntactic constellation with only a handful of minor exceptions (see
Bucknell 1994:4); morphologically or syntactically only (e.g. Kimatuumbi vowel shorte­
ning of the phrasal head, Odden 1987; Welsh mutations, Ball/Müller 1992); or both pho­
nologically and morphologically/syntactically, e.g. Italian raddoppiamento sintattico
(Nespor/Vogel 1982). Nivkh consonant alternation is conditioned by both the phonologi­
cal (final and initial sound constellations) and the syntactic context (undergoer-verb, at­
tribute-noun, possessor-noun).
Finally, whereas most sandhi processes occur under adjacency of the target and
trigger, Welsh mutations, which are termed sandhi, occur under both adjacency and nonadjacency (syntactic triggers). With respect to this criterion, Nivkh consonant alterna­
tions occur strictly under adjacency.
Besides these defining parameters, the actual morphophonemic processes recog­
nized as sandhi are quite heterogeneous. Among them are assimilation (Sanskrit), vowel
harmony (e.g. in Hungarian), elision (French), epenthesis (French liaison, English lin­
king-r), resyllabification (French enchaînement), lenition (Gorgia Toscana, Welsh muta­
tions), fortition of segments (Welsh word-internal mutations) and also of suprasegmentals, e.g. tone sandhi in Chinese (Chen 1987).
These varied features make sandhi a very vague concept, or rather a melting pot.
In view of the variety of the phenomena, a more concise classification is missed if all of
them are subsumed under the one term sandhi which conceals their status and functiona­
lity. While Kimatuumbi vowel shortening seems to be a strict phrase marker, Welsh mu­
tations are not consistently so, and Italian raddoppiamento sintattico is consistent within
phrases, but also applies between constituents of different phrases (Nespor/Vogel 1986:
228). English linking-r and Sanskrit sandhi, on the other hand, obviously do not define
syntactic units.
A case in point is the French liaison, which at first seems to bear a resemblance
to Nivkh in that it leads to a coalescence of independent words in a phrase. However, aDEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD97distinction is to be made in French between environments in which liaison (and analo­
gously, enchaînement) is obligatory, optional or impossible; furthermore, liaison (conso­
nant epenthesis), enchaînement (resyllabification), and vowel elision complement one
another in a common functionality, a fact which is not of interest to a number of studies
concerning French (see for example De Jong 1990, Klausenburger 1974:175, Kaisse
1985:162-168).
Liaison, enchaînement, and elision are obligatory in two environments (ignoring
frozen expressions): (i) between the determiner (articles; several indefinite determiners;
possessive, demonstrative, and interrogative adjectives; quantifiers; and numerals (De
Jong 1990:79)) and the following element (modifier or head), and (ii) with pronominal
markers directly preceding or following the verb as well as with the negation marker on
the verb (cf. Malécot 1975:163-166). In both cases, all three mechanisms operate on dif­
ferent forms constituting one paradigm, as exemplified below.

9.2
Noun complexity due to root concatenation
A complex noun may arise from a productive ad-hoc concatenation of lexical roots, i.e.
morphemes which may form free words on their own otherwise. Although the pattern is
usually the same for compounding and ad hoc concatenation, compounds are lexicalized
formations. The latter mechanism is as productive and free as the construction of phrases
in other languages, and its products do not necessarily enter the lexicon. Such construc­
tions are reported for various unrelated languages, both polysynthetic, e.g. Chukchi
(Chukcho-Kamchadal), Ket, Ainu, So:ra (Munda), Onge (Andamanese), Tunica, Kiowa
(Kiowa-Tanoan), Comanche (Uto-Aztecan), Lakhota (Siouan), Wichita (Caddoan),COMPLEX NOUN FORMS255Mandan, Yagua, Urubu-Kaapor, Tupí, Mapudungun (Araucanian), and perhaps Pano
(Panoan), and non-polysynthetic, e.g. Sanskrit, German (see chapter 3.8), and Yuchi
(North America), as we shall see. There may be more languages of this type, but descrip­
tions of noun forms are comparatively rare. For those languages which allow, for ex­
ample, compounding of nominal roots, e.g. Eastern Porno (Pomoan), Maidu (Maiduan),
Muskogee (Muskogean), Nez Perce (Sahaptian), Karok, Takelma, Tonkawa, Wappo,
Zuni (see Mithun 1999), and Ket (Werner 1997), a distinction between a productive ad
hoc formation and lexicalized compounds is usually not drawn. Descriptions furnishing
details to a sufficient degree exist only for Chukchi, Ainu (somewhat difficult), and
Sanskrit.
The integrative potential of the noun form varies. Starting with the better de­
scribed languages, a syntactic organization very parallel to the noun complex in Nivkh
is found in at least two other languages which are geographically not very distant from
Nivkh: Chukchi and Ainu.
9.2.1 Chukchi and Ainu
Chukchi is a member of the Chukcho-Kamchadal family which is also subsumed under
Paleosiberian languages but not actually genetically related to Nivkh; Ainu is a language
isolate formerly spoken on Hokkaido, the Kuril islands, and Sakhalin. Nivkh and Ainu
were in close contact for a considerable amount of time and the multilingual Nivkh on
the island of Sakhalin spoke Ainu (Gruzdeva 1998:8). Chukchi is a polysynthetic lan­
guage, and Ainu is considered to be one as well by Shibatani (1990:17), although it
seems to be less complex than Chukchi. Both languages manifest polypersonal verb
forms with noun incorporation, verb root serialization, and integration of adverbials and
various grammatical categories into the verb (cf. Spencer 1995:444-448, 455-459;
Shibatani 1990:60-76, 80; Baker 1996:37 (fn. 26)).
In Chukchi, determiners, possessive pronouns, wh-words, quantifiers, and noun
or verb roots are incorporated recursively into a nominal word form, and this mechanism
is described as even more productive than noun incorporation by Spencer (1995:477,
479-480). Such integration is, however, obligatory for non-absolutive NPs, whereas in
the absolutive, these elements form a noun phrase as separate words. In case forms other
than the absolutive, the noun complex is an accentual unit subject to vowel harmony
(grossly low vowels of 'dominant' morphemes trigger harmony of high vowels, cf.
Spencer 1995:445), schwa epenthesis, and word-final vowel reduction (Dunn 2001
ms.:ll), in the same way as affixation and a noun-incorporating verbal complex are
(Spencer 1995:478). It is also inflected as a whole, with inflectional circumfixes consti­
tuting a nice proof of wordhood for both the nominal and the verbal complexes.
The following are examples of the different cases, (13) showing an integrated
deictic element, ( 14) a possessive marker, ( 15) a numeral, (16) an interrogative pronoun,
(17) a modifying nominal root and (18) a modifying verb root.","[263, 264, 265, 266]"
"TYPOLOGICAL OUTLOOK(ii)277these components express several of the following categories: event or partici­
pant classification and quantification, setting (e.g. ""in the night""), location or di­
rection, motion, instrument (e.g. ""by hand""), manner (""by pulling"", ""quickly""),
modality (including evidentiality), degree, scale (""only"", ""also"") and focus,
chronology (e.g. ""first"", ""again""), as well as the usual categories such as va­

dead_one-thingnə67Panfilov interprets mu (the root of muḍ ""s.o. dies/died"") as being a 'participle' and mu4
""dead person"" as a finite verb form in attributive use. Muḍ, however, is not a verb in its
finite ḍ-form, but a nominalized verb form lexicalized as a noun. As such it is identical
in sheer form to the nominalized/indicative/citation form of the verb muḍ ""s.o. dies/
died"". Krejnovič (1966:39) correctly criticizes Panfilov for not observing categorial dis­
tinctions when citing these examples. Further arguments against Panfilov's approach to
the 'participle' are presented in chapter 6.1.
Panfilov's main criticisms of Krejnovič are first, that Krejnovič does not con­
form to the official opinion regarding incorporation as forwarded by the Soviet Academy
of Sciences (presented above), and second, that his argumentation is contradictory.
Krejnovič, on the other hand, who in his earlier works writes cautiously of 'synthetism' in Nivkh (1934:194 and 1937:26-35), takes up the term incorporation from
Panfilov (who suggests that Krejnovič actually means incorporation when he talks of
synthetism, 1954:12), and, following Boas, conceives of incorporation as the inclusion
of an object noun or pronoun in the verb (1958:21).
He considers the Nivkh noun + verb and verb + noun complexes to be cases of
incorporation, forming one single word and encoding syntactic relations (1958, 1966).
He points out that the components of the complexes in Nivkh are not free words, but
bound 'bases' (stems), and that lexical morphemes have several phonologically- and
syntactically-conditioned allomorphs. In the case of nouns, one allomorph is used as a
free form because it is a case form (nominative); the others are bound forms which enter
into the complexes or are inflected. The appearance of allomorphs with different initial
sounds, then, produces the effect of consonant alternation. According to Krejnovič, a
verb root cannot be used as a free form (contrary to Panfilov's claim), but has to be
either minimally marked by the inflectional suffix -4 or to enter into a complex with a
noun. Furthermore, transitive verbs are not complete without a personal prefix or a noun
expressing the direct object (1966:41-42). To summarize, Krejnovič correctly observes
that the verbal allomorphs are bound forms and that the finite marker -ḍ (and indeed any
modal marker for that matter) is not permitted to appear on an attributive verb form. He
adds that, parallel to the disallowed finite markers, case marking is not allowed within
complexes, either (1966:42).
Krejnovič considers the nasal alternation triggered by a lost weak nasal to be
evidence against Panfilov's interpretation of consonant alternation as external sandhi
(1958:26): whereas Panfilov interprets two morphemes between which consonant alter­
nation occurs as two separate words, Krejnovič points out that since the alternation-trig­
gering nasal elides in the Amur dialect, there are no nasals in the surfacing syntagmatic68DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHchain (where words come together) which could plausibly induce the special alternation.
The alternation must therefore take place at the level of word formation. This reflection
leads Krejnovič to locate the formation of word complexes on the morphological level,
because lexical properties of the constituents play their part in it, although he generally
considers the Nivkh type of 'incorporation' (as he calls it) to be a syntactic device.
Krejnovič presents us with the bracket-like function of personal prefixes in com­
plexes (1958:26, 1966:40, 42), to which we will return in section 3.8. He furthermore
stresses that the same obligatory consonant alternations are observed at morpheme boun­
daries in noun + verb complexes, verb + noun complexes, on suffixes and in compounds
(1958:30-31). Nevertheless, complexes, according to Krejnovič, are distinguished from
compounds in their formational potential. Krejnovič demonstrates that consonant alter­
nations do not just occur anywhere in identical phonological environments, but are strict­
ly syntactically conditioned (1966:48). He also describes the syntactic conditions under
which there is no complex formation of undergoer and verb (1958:26-28), namely in
object focus, in the coordination of objects or modifiers, and between ditransitive verbs
and their patients (he does not use this terminology, though; cf. chapter 4.4).
Thus, Krejnovič introduces a considerable amount of relevant and conclusive
evidence for the discussion of wordhood in Nivkh. His arguments and valuable insights
will be taken up throughout this study.
This short overview was presented in order to demonstrate the nature of the
argument between the two scholars. Their main point of conflict comes from a different
conception of the linguistic entity word and its application to Nivkh. The constituents of
a complex are analyzed in two diametrically opposed ways, either as free words or as
bound stems. Today, forty years after the dispute, the difficulty in reconstructing their
arguments lies partly in the evolution of the discussion of incorporation, which renders
a number of (especially Panfilov's) points unsubstantiated. Whether or not there is incor­
poration in Nivkh from the current viewpoint will be discussed in chapter 5. Suffice it
here to say that neither Panfilov nor Krejnovič consider the paraphrasability of incorpo­
rating constructions to be a necessary criterion for the recognition of incorporation. On
the contrary, Panfilov values the existence of a paraphrase for an object-verb complex as
evidence against incorporation (1954). Other current parameters of incorporation, such
as categorial prerequisites, referentiality and modifier stranding, were equally unknown
in Panfilov's and Krejnovič's time. Furthermore, Panfilov adduces several idiosyncratic
criteria. An evaluation of these points necessitates the presentation of the details of the
structure of word complexes, which will be done in the course of the following chapters.
For this reason, the original dispute has not been reconstructed in greater detail here.
Krejnovič's position is backed by two other independent studies, Korsakov
(1939) and Bondarko & Zinder (1962). Korsakov compares what he calls incorporation
in Chukcho-Kamchadal languages, Nivkh, and Native American languages (especially
Lakhota, but also Delaware and Nahuatl), and describes different types of incorporative
structures shared by these languages. He presents what we have called the noun + noun,
verb + noun, noun + verb, and verb + verb complexes, as well as complexes formed
from more than two roots, using several examples from the different languages, andDEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD69attributes the same word status to the Nivkh constructions as, for instance, to the
Chukchi and Lakhota ones (1939). We will examine Bondarko & Zinder's study in de­
tail in section 3.4; they analyze phonetic properties of Nivkh complexes and compounds
and come to the conclusion that they are both units (1962).
It is interesting to note that after the dispute between Krejnovič and Panfilov, the
issues of wordhood and incorporation are not touched upon in grammatical sketches or
papers on Nivkh, e.g. Hattori (1962a, b); Otaina (1978); Beffa (1982a), etc.; the topic is
mentioned cautiously if at all. Only Savel'eva (1966), in a review of Panfilov's grammar,
criticizes Panfilov by repeating and elaborating upon some of Krejnovič's arguments.
Jakobson (1971, originally published in 1957, i.e. at the time when the dispute had just
begun) proves to be indecisive. On the one hand, he identifies 'syntactic sections' which
are defined as constituting a sentence, being stress units, and only admitting pausing at
their outer boundaries (not within). He addresses the constituents of his 'sections' as
morphemes and points out that there ""are striking differences between intersectional and
intrasectional laws of phonemic combination"" (1971:78). On the other hand, he con­
ceives of a word as a 'monothematic section' (consisting of one stem) or a ""component
of a polythematic section"", only to go on to say that ""the fusion of two words into one
syntactic section takes place always and only when the stem of the subordinated word is
immediately followed by the subordinating word"" (1971:80). He adds that he uses a dash
""to separate stems within a polythematic section"" (1971:80). Thus on the whole, it is not
clear which status he considers complexes and their components to have. Otaina (1978:
104) mentions the disagreement on the status of the unmarked attributive verb form and
without further discussion takes sides with Panfilov. Gruzdeva (1998:16) devotes one
paragraph of her grammatical sketch to stating that ""Nivkh is an agglutinating synthetic
language"" in which the constructions attribute + head and direct object + verb ""are
sometimes considered as incorporated complexes"" because they form ""particularly close
units"" syntactically and phonologically.
Nearly forty years after the original dispute, the subject was revisited by Kaneko
(1999), who in the first part of his paper outlines the discussion between Panfilov and
Krejnovič, agreeing largely with Panfilov's arguments. He then reassesses the old mate­
rial from a general formal stance, proposing a bipartite interpretation of the phenomenon,
viz. classifying any concatenation of uninflected object and verb as the incorporation of
word stems (which Krejnovič advocated), and any concatenation of an inflected form
and a verb as the sandhi of words (Panfilov's solution) (1999:40-46). Alternatively, he
proposes the solution to stipulate (in a generative model) that the whole of a maximal
projection (an object + verb or an attribute + noun phrase) is incorporated even if it con­
tains coordinated free forms outside of a complex (1999:45, 47).
What has not been undertaken to date is a study of Nivkh based on current
models of both wordhood (see e.g. Hall 1999a) and incorporation (e.g. Mithun 1984,
Gerdts 1996, etc.). Wordhood is usually considered to have phonological as well as
morphological and psychological aspects to it, so the bulk of this chapter will be devoted
to the study of the phonological, morphophonological, morphological, and psychological
aspects of the word in Nivkh. These criteria have not been treated in a thorough or70DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHdetailed fashion for Nivkh to date, and it is intended both to flesh out the old debate and
to examine it from a contemporary perspective.
3.2
The phonological word in Nivkh
The term 'phonological word' is employed in different senses. It was used by Matthews
(1991:30) to describe a word-form as a phonological unit in contrast to the lexical unit,
the lexeme, and the grammatical word, a paradigmatic form of a lexeme. Matthews him­
self, however, prefers to reserve the term 'phonological word' for ""a single unit at the
phonological level"" (1991:216), defined by accent, for instance (1991:209), and inclu­
ding clitics. Since the 1980s and such influential works as Selkirk (1984), Kaisse (1985),
and Nespor & Vogel (1986), the 'phonological word' has been emancipated as an entity
in its own right on the phonological level, independent of the morphological/grammati­
cal word. It is a prosodic constituent larger than the syllable or foot and smaller than the
phonological phrase, defined by phonological rules (such as assimilation, vowel harmo­
ny, stress, syllabification, etc.), phonotactics, and minimality constraints (cf. Hall 1999a:
1-3) in phonological theory.
In this sense, it is no longer the phonological side of a grammatical word as it
used to be because it is not isomorphic with a grammatical word, although its boundaries
coincide with morphosyntactic boundaries (Hall 1999a:2). Compounds or prefix + stem
constructions often constitute two phonological words, such as, for example, in the case
of Hungarian vowel harmony (Hall 1999a:2, 3-4, Beck 1999:23). In Hungarian, the do­
main for vowel harmony is stem + suffix, whereas vowels in a prefix do not harmonize
with the vowels of the following stem, and vowels of two compounded stems need not
harmonize either. There is still controversy about which phonological phenomena consti­
tute evidence for the phonological word as a prosodic constituent and which do not (Hall
1999a:20), especially in the case of conflicting findings.
Hence, from the point of view of this model, phonological traits are no longer
the basis for the identification of morphological words.
This insight has a serious bearing on our conception of polysynthesis, which we
are discussing here. The polysynthetic morphological type hinges on complex morpholo­
gical units whose existence has to be proven independently. An examination of phonolo­
gical wordhood in polysynthetic languages, as undertaken by Beck (1999), Russell
(1999), McDonough (1990) and Rice (1993), shows that the phonological basis for such
a morphological structure is not well founded.
Rice (1993:164) defines the verb form in Slave (a polysynthetic Athapaskan lan­
guage) as a phonological phrase, i.e. larger than one phonological word. Within this unit,
the verb stem plus ""functional items"" (person marking, voice, and aspect) form one pho­
nological word, and all ""lexical morphemes"", i.e. morphemes contributing rather con­
crete meanings which translate as nouns, adverbs, preverbs, adpositions, or verbs into
more analytic languages, are phonologically separate items (Rice 1993:163). The phono­
logical word in Slave is singled out as a consonant-final entity and is characterized by
foot formation rules, tone patterns, and voice and vowel assimilation. The phonological
phrase is again defined by phonological properties such as glottal stop insertion at its leftDEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD71edge. The verb form, then, is considered by Rice (1993:165-166) to be not a lexical but
a phrasal construct, with its single word status being a ""derived property"". She does not
discuss stress or pause structure.
McDonough (1990:7-9, 15-16, 24-27, 45-47) demonstrates that the verb com­
plex in Navaho (Athapaskan) consists of three different domains for phonological rules:
the clitic group (traditionally called disjunct prefixes), which is less tightly bound; the
prefixes for person, aspect and mood (called conjunct prefixes); and the classifier + stem
section.
Russell (1999) examines what have traditionally been called 'words' in the two
polysynthetic languages Cree (Algonquian) and Lakhota (Siouan). In Cree, the verbal
template is composed of a person prefix, preverbs, a stem, and suffixes. Among the preverbs, there are elements signalling tense or adverbial concepts. The stem itself can be
complex, containing for example more than one root, a noun classifier and a valency
marker. There are ten suffix slots for person markers (including obviative and inverse)
and for TAM markers (see Russell 1999:204-206). In the linguistic tradition, all this ma­
terial has been written with hyphens (Russell 1999:206). Native speakers, however, con­
sider the complex to consist of more than one word and write the person prefix, each
preverb and the verb stem as separate words (ibidem). Furthermore, there is syntactic
evidence that the complex can be interrupted by other constituents (Russell 1999:210).
From the perspective of phonological wordhood, Russell points out the following
characteristics (1999:208-210):
(i)
Preverbs fulfill the minimal word constraint by being bimoraic and can even be
as long as four syllables.
(ii)
There are no special phonotactic restrictions on their form.
(iii)
Preverbs + verb have separate stress assignment domains, although preverbs are
assigned secondary stress.
(iv)
The final vowel of a preverb is optionally devoiced, as are word-final vowels.
Vowels at the verb stem boundary or at a compound boundary are not devoiced.
(v)
Two adjacent vowels across a preverb or word boundary undergo contraction or
deletion of the first and compensatory lengthening of the second, whereas in the
stem+suffixes domain there is most commonly glide epenthesis in such a case.
(vi)
The preverb boundaries are not subject to morphophonological processes occur­
ring within the stem-suffix domain.
In Lakhota, the verb complex has twelve prefix position classes, expressing person, loca­
lization, instrumentais and benefactives, as well as seven suffix position classes expres­
sing TAM categories, negation and connectives (Russell 1999:214). In this language, the
suffixes are less tightly bound to the stem. Native speakers write outer suffixes as sepa­
rate words, but the cut-off point between inner and outer suffixes varies. The suffixes
bear secondary stress, and connectives even appear clause-initially as free conjunctional
particles (1999:216). Suffixes, as opposed to prefixes, may contain consonant clusters
and be polysyllabic. Within suffix chains, resyllabification does not take place (Russell
1999:215-219). Thus, there is no clear evidence for or against wordhood of the verb72DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHcomplex in Lakhota. Russell suggests that traditional 'words' in polysynthetic languages
are perhaps better analyzed as phonological phrases (1999:220).
If the polysynthetic word is lacking a phonological foundation even in ac­
knowledged polysynthetic languages, we either have to give up the concept as a whole
or to attribute more weight to morphological evidence in the recognition of wordhood.
Nevertheless, we will examine the phonological word in Nivkh here to determine how
different the complexes are from simplex, inflected, and derived forms, as well as from
lexicalized compounds, and use this as subsidiary evidence. The criteria to be examined
are minimal word condition, phonotactics, syllable structure, stress placement, reduplica­
tion patterns, and morphophonemics.
3.2.1 Syllables, medial plosives and final fricatives in Nivkh
There is no constraint on the minimal word in Nivkh, which means that there is virtually
no 'impossible word' in this language (except for vowelless phoneme sequences). Even
monomoraic syllables occur. Additionally, Nivkh allows for a wide range of syllable
types (cf. Hattori 1988:1409, 1955:756-757; Austerlitz 1980:77):
V
i ""river"", a ""fathom"", e ""comb""
CV
ño ""barn"", k'u ""arrow"", mu ""boat"", vo ""village"", k'e ""net""
CCV přə ""hut"", tlə ""sky"", pa ""rod"", mla ""ear"" (ES)

VCC
uñs ""dish"", org ""trough"", osk ""face""
VCCC antx ""guest"", avsq ""ruff, amsp ""seal"" (kind)

CVCC təmk ""hand"", ŋəŋg ""hair"", qosk ""rowan""
CVCCC hontq ""sack"", taxtl ""floating net"", tevrq ""small bird""
In Nivkh, it is always the whole root which is reduplicated, regardless of its syllable
structure or the sounds adjoining at the morpheme boundary, e.g. mloʁmloʁoḍ ""sth. is
whole"". Wherever sonority permits, resyllabification takes place across any morpheme
boundary, be it the result of affixation or complex formation, as in

""my father catches up with my mother""[pɨm.kald]This behavior is a very strong argument in favor of the wordhood of a complex.
Plosives and fricatives show a characteristic distribution in Nivkh which can be
used to identify initial, medial and final positions of words (cf. Krejnovič 1937:81-86,
Jakobson 1971:83-84). In the absolute initial position, aspirated and voiceless plosives
are contrasted, e.g.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"

""children's playground""As the examples have shown, both sentence formation and word formation in Nivkh rely
on the same principle of dependent-head synthesis.
From the evidence we have studied so far, morphology does indeed play a cen­
tral role in Nivkh, albeit not as important a role as in the Iroquoian languages. A com­
plex verb form may be a minimal clause, and we thus encounter 'word sentences' in
Nivkh. Since the undergoer, as one of the participants of a transitive verb, is marked ob­
ligatorily on the verb, while the subject is not marked on a range of verb forms, calling
these forms 'word-sentences' is perhaps too strong a claim. In this case, we minimally
have 'word-phrases', composed of the predicate and its object, while the subject is out­
side of the construction.
The principle of dependent-head synthesis nevertheless contrasts with the word
formation principle in Greenlandic, Spokane (Salish; see Carlson 1972:110), Sarcee and
Navaho (Athapaskan; Cook 1984:126; Young/Morgan 1980:107), and with Tariana
(North Arawak; Aikhenvald 1999:237), for instance, in which a single word form con-218DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHtains no more than one lexical root2, and complexity arises from the multitude of nonroot bound morphemes attached to it. The Nivkh principle of complex forms constructed
of lexical roots and a smaller set of affixes may seem to be unique at first glance. Other
languages, and what is more, languages which are conceived of as polysynthetic, share
it, however, such as Ket (the only surviving Yeniseian language; compare the verb tem­
plate by Werner 1997:154-155), Chukchi (Chukcho-Kamchadal; see Skorik 1961,1977;
Spencer 1995), So:ra (Munda; see the verb template by Pinnow 1966:179) and probably
Ainu (isolate, but typologically close to the Paleosiberian language group; see Shibatani
1990, Tamura 2000:182-183, 193-224). These languages also manifest a rather low
number of non-root bound morphemes and a complex verb form due to the concatena­
tion of lexical roots.
Concatenation of lexical roots is, of course, characteristic of the way composi­
tion works, but here again we have to distinguish between composition and ad hoc for­
mations (see chapter 3.8). Whereas compounds are lexicalized formations, in polysyn­
thetic languages we are dealing with constructions formed ad hoc, productively and
freely.
We thus have two basic polysynthetic strategies, one operating on non-root
bound morphemes, the other on a compositional-like formation. This classification will
be taken up in the concluding chapter.
7.5
Conclusion
We may state that Nivkh fulfills a considerable number of poly synthesis criteria, viz. the
integration into a complex verb form of material expressing one undergoer, causative,
aspectoids, tense, degree, modality, mood, scalar operators, focus values, manner, quan­
tification, and location. On the other hand, Nivkh does not exhibit an exemplary polypersonalism and does not have an extensive set of non-root bound morphemes as do, for in­
stance, Greenlandic, Klamath, Navaho, etc. A comparison with different polysynthetic
languages shows, however, that there are other languages with a small set of such bound
morphemes, and also languages which rely chiefly on noun incorporation and verb root
serialization for complexity of the verb form. Nivkh exhibits a templatic organization of
the suffixal domain of the verb complex, allowing ad hoc derivation back and forth be­
tween nouns and verbs, and a root-chaining organization to the left of the head mor­
pheme.
In this way, Nivkh fits into the heterogeneous pool of polysynthetic languages,
and also fits into the polysynthesis classification by Drossard (1997:262), whereby
(i)
there is integration of adverbial material (manner: verb root serialization; de­
gree: suffixes; location: landmark nouns and verbs);
(ii)
the verb form is sentential (though perhaps not fully polypersonal); and
(iii)
there is integration of nominal material (via dependent-head synthesis).","[228, 229]"

275276DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHNivkh fulfills a considerable number of polysynthesis criteria, viz. the integration of ma­
terial expressing one undergoer, causative, aspectoids, tense, degree, modality, mood,
scalar operators, focus values, manner, quantification, and location into a complex verb
form. These categories are partly encoded by non-root bound morphemes, of which there
is only a moderate number, and partly by dependent-head synthesis. Nivkh exhibits a
templatic organization of the suffixal domain of the verb complex and a root-chaining
organization to the left of the head morpheme.
With its highly synthetic word complexes and its head-marked pattern, the
Nivkh structure is reminiscent of polysynthesis. Still, we have not yet reached a conclu­
sion as to whether or not Nivkh really fits into the picture of polysynthetic languages.
10.2
Basic structural types of polysynthesis - an attempt at a classification
As there is no accepted definition of polysynthesis, and polysynthesis in the traditional
sense is a 'feeling' rather than a clear-cut class, we have to compare Nivkh to the lan­
guages which make a polysynthetic impression in a heuristic approach according to the
parameters listed in chapter 7. In the same chapter, we already alluded to the heteroge­
neity of such languages. It has led Fortescue to set up a first classification of different
types of polysynthesis as follows (1994:2602)1:
(a) pure incorporating (Chukchi, Onondaga)
(b) recursive affixing (West Greenlandic, Yupik)
(c) field-affixing (Atsugewa, Kalispel)
(d) mixed 1+3 (Koyukon)
(e) mixed 2+3 (Kwakwala)
(f) mixed 1+2 (Nahuatl).
Based on an examination of approximately 75 languages, we will rearrange and
modify this classification somewhat, restricting us to verbal polysynthesis for the
moment.2
First, based on the catalogue of polysynthesis traits (by Mithun 1988, Fortescue 1994,
and Drossard 1997; see chapter 7), I use the following set of formal and semantic criteria
for polysynthesis:
(3)
(i)1A language is acknowledged to be polysynthetic because of
the existence of complex, polymorphemic verb forms which allow, within one
word unit, for components in the form of non-root bound morphemes with quite
'lexical' meaning or optionally for the concatenation of lexical roots;The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are obviously meant to refer to the small letters (a), (b), and (c) by
Fortescue.
2
In order to assess these languages, I had to rely on grammars that varied in their extent of detail.
It may well be that the classification reached in this study will need future correction because
relevant information on the classificatory parameters used here was misinterpreted or is not expli­
citly or unambiguously mentioned in the grammars consulted. When there was any doubt, the
language in question was left out of the classification.","[285, 286, 287]"
"INTRODUCTION5Abstracting from the above-mentioned difficulties and far-fetched comparisons in the li­
terature, lexical resemblances to Uralic languages are quite striking. From the typologi­
cal perspective, however, Nivkh shows affinities to Chukchi, Ainu, and Native American
languages in morphological type, as we shall see.
Four dialects are distinguished within the Nivkh language:
(i) the Amur dialect on the continent
(ii) the North Sakhalin dialect on the north and west coasts of Sakhalin
(iii) the East Sakhalin dialect on the East coast and
(iv) the South Sakhalin dialect in the Poronaisk region.
The Amur and the East Sakhalin dialects are quite distinct in phonology, grammar, and
lexicon, and mutual intelligibility is claimed to be very low by native speakers. The
North Sakhalin dialect is intermediate between these two, but closer to the Amur variety
(cf. Gruzdeva 1998:7). The South Sakhalin dialect is again distinct from the East Sakha­
lin one and at the other extreme of the Amur variety. The Sakhalin dialects are generally
more archaic.
In phonology, the most salient differences are in plosive phonemes, sound
changes and phonotactics in consonant clusters. The major correspondences in the Amur
and East Sakhalin varieties are as follows:

/d/~/nt/
/řI/w/ and NI have merged in the Amur dialect.
In the Sakhalin varieties, more complex consonant clusters are allowed than in
the Amur dialect, but with all fricative plus plosive clusters being voiceless.
Within the lexicon, cognates are generally easily established, but there are conspicuous
clashes in the basic vocabulary (examples in table 1.1 are taken from Savel'eva/Taksami
1970, Nakagawa/Sato/Saito 1993, Hattori 1962a).
Morphology differs, for instance, in the number of cases which are distinguished
on the noun and in the form of aspectoid, converb, mood, and modality suffixes. The
morphemes representing these categories in different dialects are not cognates; or there
are periphrastic constructions in the Amur variety and synthetic ones on Sakhalin, e.g.
negation and modality (see chapter 6.4). The Sakhalin dialects have a participle which is
absent in the Amur region as a result of phonological erosion (see chapters 3.1, 6.1).
From the syntactic point of view, there seem to be no significant differences
between the varieties.
In this study, we will focus on the Amur variety for reasons of documentation,
and cite examples from other dialects wherever relevant. They will be indicated as East6DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHSakhalin (ES), North Sakhalin (NS), and South Sakhalin (SS) in contrast to Amur Nivkh

As a substantial part of the structural and phonological characteristics of Nivkh will be
treated in detail in the main body of this study, a short grammatical sketch will suffice
here, starting with morphology.
Morphology in Nivkh is largely agglutinating. The two major lexical categories
are nouns (including pronouns, numerals, and quantifiers) and verbs; adverbial particles
constitute a minor closed class. Both nouns and verbs inflect and enter into complex
2Missing items in the table are due to a lack of appropriate data.
A word on the transcription of Nivkh examples in this volume is in order here. Among linguists,
heterogeneous Roman transliteration systems and various versions of Cyrillic orthography, which
differ in the imitation of Russian syllabic writing conventions and in special characters for
phonemes inexistent in Russian, are in use. In January 2002, during a workshop on the Nivkh
language, Ekaterina Gruzdeva, Daniel Abondolo, Martin Haspelmath and I proposed a would-be
Roman transcription standard for Nivkh, which is based on the systems used by Krejnovič (1934)
and by Austerlitz. For an overview refer to Chapter 2. The transliteration I have been using
differs from this standard in four characters taken from the IPA set: <ə> instead of <y>, <G> in­
stead of <g>,
instead of <ÿ>, and <χ>instead of
. Because of technical difficulties the
characters could not be substituted before the manuscript went into print. Nivkh examples from
all sources have been adapted to the transcription used throughout this study, and obvious typos
have been corrected. In the South Sakhalin dialect, the tense plosives are transcribed as <p t ţ k
q> and the lax ones as <b d g G> by Austerlitz, Hattori, and Watanabe while <p' t' ţ' k' q'>
(tense) and <p t ţ k q> (lax) are used here.","[15, 16, 17]"

So far, Japanese does not look very polysynthetic. Relevant categories from the cata­
logue in (3), however, may be expressed within a complex verb form via verb root seria­
lization (as in Yucatec Maya), viz. phases of states of affairs, manner, direction, chrono­
logy, degree, and valence-changing (cf. the list by Martin 1988:441-455). Compare the

disliked by native speakers), the effect of verb root serialization is comparable to that of
affixes in polysynthetic languages (remember that apersonalism does not prevent a lan­
guage from being polysynthetic).
Is there then anything delimiting Japanese from polysynthetic languages? Note
that the overall complexity of the verb form (measured by morpheme count, something
often cited as a means to identify polysynthesis, see Fortescue 1994:2601) is not a valid
distinctive feature. Most examples of verb forms cited in grammars of and papers on po­
lysynthetic languages are not very complex and contain only two to four morphemes
(see examples e.g. in Fortescue 1984, Mithun 1999). What Japanese, Swedish, and Yu­
catec Maya clearly lack, in contrast to those languages which are considered polysynthe­
tic without a doubt, are adverbial elements in the form of non-root bound morphemes in
the verb form, such as locational, instrumental, or manner ones.
If we want to exclude Japanese, Swedish, and Yucatec Maya from polysynthetic
languages, then the existence of at least one non-root bound morpheme with a fairly 'le­
xical' meaning in the locational, instrumental or manner domain (the latter two are
sometimes difficult to keep apart) must be made a necessary condition for polysynthesis,
in line with what Drossard (1997) postulates. The problem with this criterion, besides its
still being vague, is that the ideas about 'lexical' (or 'concrete' as it is sometimes called)
meaning and ontological domains are conceived from a Eurocentric or Anglocentric
viewpoint.
Nevertheless, we do not seem to gain anything by trying to concretize the crite­
rion, e.g. by fixing which kind of non-root bound morpheme constitutes a minimal con-280DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHdition for the recognition of polysynthesis.
The comparison of the 62 languages of our sample which look sufficiently polysynthetic in the heuristic approach shows that 56 of these have at least one local or direc­
tional affix, with Chinook (Boas 191Id), Sarcee (Athapaskan; Cook 1984), Tonkawa
(Hoijer 1933), Wintu (Wintuan; Pitkin 1984), and So:ra (Munda; Pinnow 1966) having
locationals to the exclusion of instrumental and manner elements (where the adverbial
domain is concerned). Chukchi (Chukcho-Kamchadal; Kämpfe/Volodin 1995), So:ra
and Arabana-Wangkangurru (Pama-Nyungan; Hercus 1994) each have a single local/di­
rectional morpheme, and Classical Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan; Andrews 1975) and Iroquoian
languages have two (called 'cislocative' and 'translocative' in Iroquoian).
Instrumentals, on the other hand, occur considerably less often (in 24 lan­
guages). Languages with instrumentais have locationals as well, with the exception of
Washo (see Kroeber 1907), which has instrumentais only (where the adverbial domain
is concerned). Manner elements occur in 25 languages, four of which do not have loca­
tionals and only seven of which have instrumentais as well. Other affixes are even less
common. Chronology affixes, for instance, occur in 19 languages (all with locationals,
but only three which also have instrumentais), and degree affixes are found in 17 lan­
guages, four of which lack locationals and instrumentais. Kwakwala (Wakashan; Boas
1911c), Yana (Mithun 1999:565), and Paumari (Arawan; Chapman/Derbyshire 1991)
have four of the five categories examined and no instrumentais. Thus, the findings do
not allow any implicational hierarchy to be set up.
The overwhelming results for locationals suggest that the existence of such ma­
terial should be made a necessary condition for polysynthesis. By this criterion, how­
ever, not only Yucatec Maya, but also Washo, Kiowa (Kiowa-Tanoan; see Watkins
1984), Cahuilla (Uto-Aztecan; see Seiler 1977), Yuki (see Kroeber 1911), Pirahä (MuraPirahã; see Everett 1986), Urubu-Kaapor (Tupí-Guaraní; see Kakumasu 1986), Ainu (see
Tamura 2000), and, last but not least, Nivkh, would be excluded from polysynthetic lan­
guages, even though they all have non-root bound morphemes encoding more than one
of the categories of manner, degree, modality, valence-changing, instrument, motion,
phase and chronology, and fit into the heuristic idea of poly synthesis. Washo, Kiowa,
Cahuilla, and Yuki, however, have motional affixes which might substitute for locatio­
nals to fulfill the condition. Compare examples from Kiowa and Pirahä to Chukchi and
Greenlandic below.

xity, since it seems to lack local elements. The only candidates are -umisaar- ""back and
forth"", -jaar- ""early"", and -jaallu- ""early (habitually)"", which do not qualify as local but
rather as frequency and manner, according to Fortescue (1990). Greenlandic undoubted­
ly lacks instrumentais.
In any case, the existence of a locational bound morpheme on the verb could not
be a sufficient condition for polysynthesis, as it is true of languages with local preverbs
such as South Caucasian, German, Russian, and Hungarian (see chapter 7). Therefore, it
needs to be tied to further criteria from the catalogue in (3).
If we postulated the existence of at least one non-root bound morpheme in the
domains of location, instrument or manner, Nivkh, Pirahã, and Urubu-Kaapor would still
be excluded. Because of the shortcomings of the discussed postulations, the best solution
is to leave this point open until the candidate languages for polysynthesis have been
compared on the basis of the details of their ingredients. Alternatively, we can broaden
the perspective, which will be done in section 10.3 of this chapter. The discussion has
shown, however, how decisive the fixation of delimiting criteria is in our assessment of
Nivkh, putting Nivkh in a borderline area of polysynthesis.
For the classification of polysynthesis we will depart from languages which are
not marginal with regards to the catalogue of criteria in (3).
It is easily observed that languages assign categories from the polysynthesis
catalogue to either lexical roots (via noun incorporation or verb root serialization) or to
non-root bound morphemes (including lexical affixes). Participants may be encoded via
person marking, noun incorporation or lexical affixes, while motion and phases of states
of affairs can be via verb roots or affixes; instrument, quantification, manner, or direc­
tion may be expressed by a nominal or verbal root, or by an affix. Furthermore, polysynthetic languages differ with respect to how many lexical roots they allow in a complex
verb form. These constitute the two basic parameters of one axis of our classification:
(i)
the assignment of categories of the polysynthesis catalogue to lexical roots or
non-root bound morphemes, and
(ii)
the number of lexical roots allowed in a complex word form.
This axis describes the word-formational type exhibited by a polysynthetic language.
10.2.1 Affixal and compositional polysynthesis
The application of these parameters to the languages in question results in different formational types with two extremes, either
(i)
languages which use non-root bound morphemes for all of the above-mentioned
categories in catalogue (3) and allow only one root per verb complex, which we
will henceforth call the affixal strategy, or
(ii)
languages which ad hoc combine more than one lexical root in a verb form to
attain a polysynthetic verb form, called the compositional strategy.
'Affixal' and 'compositional' have been chosen here as handy terms for the phenomena,
based on the terminology for the mechanisms of word formation. The former strategy is
not generally inflectional since most affixes are not obligatory, nor do they represent in-282DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHflectional categories. They are fully productive and marked on the verb ad hoc, so their
status is actually somewhere in the grey area between derivation and inflection. Affixal
and compositional poly synthesis are not complementary types: affixes (non-root bound
morphemes) are a necessary condition for the recognition of poly synthesis.
Before proceeding to a finer-grained classification, let us consider an example of
both types: Greenlandic, an affixally polysynthetic language, and Chukchi, a compositionally polysynthetic one.
Greenlandic (Eskimo-Aleut; Fortescue 1984) allows only one root morpheme
per word form (in the initial position) while all other categories are expressed using nonroot bound morphemes or the final inflectional suffix (for mood and person). Fortescue
(1990:321-332) lists 262 suffixes that are non-root bound morphemes and which express
categories from the catalogue (excluding category-changing, nominal affixes and inflec­
tion; see also (66) in chapter 6.4 and table 9.1 in chapter 9.1). Noun incorporation and
verb root serialization are absent in Greenlandic. There are, however, denominal verbs
(formed from lexical noun roots with verbalizing suffixes).

DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND W O R D H O O D IN NIVKHAfter having studied the morphophonemics characteristic of Nivkh, the crucial questions
to explore are (i) which status do the entities in which we observed these mechanisms
have? and (ii) which morphological type does Nivkh exhibit? The first question can be
reformulated in the following way: Are the complexes single words? The answer to this
question is of course the basis for any discussion about the morphological type. It is,
however, not easy to determine, and constitutes a topic carefully avoided in grammatical
sketches of Nivkh after a first dispute on it ended without agreement between the parties.
We will therefore proceed to study the evidence for the morphological status of Nivkh
complexes.
3.1
The old dispute
The question of wordhood in Nivkh was first raised by Krejnovič (1934, 1937) and was
discussed in the 1950s and 1960s by the two Russian 'Nivkhologists' Krejnovič and
Panfilov in a series of articles dealing with ""incorporation in Nivkh"" (Krejnovič 1958,
1966;Panfilov 1954,1958,1960a, 1963,1966). Their dispute prompted phonetic experi­
ments carried out by Bondarko & Zinder (1962), but did not lead to any agreement.
Panfilov's position, as it emerges from his articles and his grammar (1962:2533, 1965:23-30), is based on a morphosyntactic and semantic argumentation. Although
he does not contest the ""tight phonological units"" in Nivkh, pointed out by Bondarko
and Zinder (1962; their results will be taken up below), he considers these phonological
properties first not to be sufficient ( 1960a), later not to be decisive (1963:157), and final­
ly not even to be relevant (1965:27-28) for the recognition of word units. The word, in
his view, is neither a phonologically nor a morphologically defined entity, but a lexicogrammatical unit (1963:27-28). As such, he continues, it is characterized, in contrast to
morphemes and components of compounds, by having a relatively autonomous meaning,
by being a member of a paradigm, and by contracting syntactic relations with other parts
of a sentence; and it is characterized by a semantic and syntactic integrity in contrast to
what he calls 'word unions'. His 'word unions' are our complexes of modifier + head
and undergoer + verb, which undergo consonant alternation as described in chapter 2.
The complexes are thus, in his view, loose syntactic concatenations of free words by
means of sandhi and do not form a single word unit together (1966:62-63). Evidence for
the independence of the parts of a complex are, according to Panfilov, the facts that each
part of the complex preserves its lexical semantics, that each part is inflectable and
focusable (but see section 3.8.1), and that it can bear a syntactic relation to an element in
the sentence outside the complex, e.g. to an adverb, another 'direct object' or modifier,
or any other constituent. Furthermore, Panfilov claims that the elements of a complex
need not be adjacent and that there can be, as he puts it, more than one modifier,66DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHmodified, direct object or verb, i.e. in the case of coordination. In the cases of both nonadjacency and coordination, Panfilov goes on, a form occurring outside a complex has
the same form and function as the corresponding form inside, and he postulates that
identical forms have identical status. From this he concludes that the components of a
complex are not roots or stems, but free words, and that the phenomenon in question
therefore can be neither incorporation nor composition (1960a).
These arguments will be treated in detail in this chapter as they require minute
exposition in order to be made comprehensible. Suffice it here to say that Panfilov's ar­
gumentation suffers from methodological shortcomings instigated by a strict structuralis­
tic and largely Russocentric approach.
Compounds do exist in Nivkh, as Panfilov shows (1958), and he is of the opi­
nion that they express single lexical meanings and concepts, that any component prece­
ding another one may not be inflected (but see section 3.8.1), and that none of their parts
may be focused separately. Panfilov does not present further formal differences between
complexes and compounds, and does not discuss consonant alternation at the compoundinternal morpheme boundary. Incorporation, as he understood it in accordance with the
then-valid doctrine of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, is characterized by the compo­
nent parts preserving their lexical semantics and their mutual syntactic relations within
the incorporation unit, but having a different form from their free occurrence, losing
their independent word status and forming one morphological word together, as eviden­
ced, for instance, by vowel harmony, consonant alternation, etc. (1960a: 51). Further­
more, they do not contract relations to parts of the sentence outside the incorporating
unit; in other words, Panfilov postulates that an incorporated noun may not be modified
by an attribute outside of the noun-verb complex (the concept of stranding is not known
to Panfilov).
For him, any paradigmatic noun form and any paradigmatic verb form are free
word forms because they can occur as such in a sentence (Panfilov does not discriminate
between categories in this respect, see also chapter 6.1) and because all allomorphs of
one morpheme must have the same morphological status. There cannot be both free and
bound forms of one morpheme in one paradigm (1966). In particular, Panfilov considers
the suffixless attributive form of the verb in the Amur dialect to be a participle and a free
form. This claim is based primarily on treating the suffixless Amur form as equivalent to
the attributive form in the Sakhalin varieties, which has a suffix and is therefore consi­
dered to be a participle, because the Sakhalin participle ending is represented by the
nasal which has elided on the Amur (see chapter 2.3). In the Amur variety, however, the
attributive form is formally identical to the verb root (see chapter 2.4.1), and thus no par­
ticiple form exists.
Panfilov further deduces the free-form status of the attributive form from his
erroneous claim that the finite ḍ-form, which doubtless is a free form, is used as an attri­
bute in the same way his so-called 'participle' (suffixless attributive form) is, a claim
which he believes is proven by the following example.","[75, 76, 77]"

""Kaalat still has not arrived""At the same time, the verb form is not restricted in its complexity and length (compare
Greenlandic examples above and in chapter 7). Scope-ordered organization is found

tion), Lakhota (Boas/Deloria 1979:52) and Pano (Loos 1999:244, Payne 1990:226-229)
(compositional). The lack of mixed languages with noun incorporation may be an acci­
dental gap due to the limitation of the sample. Altogether, type (ii) seems to be represen­
ted by significantly fewer languages than the other.
The fact that languages of all strategies may be organized in both ways (cf. table
10.3) proves that the two axes are indeed independent.

conciliation of diametrically opposed claims with respect to the delimitation of polysyn­
thesis. The classification presented here is, however, still a rough one (for an elaboration
see Mattissen (to appear)); a closer look at the languages classified together shows a
great heterogeneity. Greenlandic, for instance, stands out on account of its derivational288DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHformation of complex words with multiple changes back and forth between the nominal
and verbal category (see chapter 7.3) and by its single inflectional morpheme per word.
Other languages, like Navaho, divide morphemes expressing meanings of apparently one
domain over several different positions. Algonquian languages are known for the three
(at least diachronic) stem positions (see Mithun 1999:339). Moreover, the differences in
the semantic fields expressed by affixes on the verb are manifold. The classification is
meant to show, however, that there are larger structural tendencies which are shared
across continents that allow an assessment of where Nivkh fits into the big picture.
10.3
A wider view of polysynthesis
The study of different aspects of Nivkh morphosyntax has shown how structure is orga­
nized by a consistent principle according to which complex word forms are formed from
the concatenation of nouns and verbs in strictly defined relationships, and that the single
compositional mechanisms resemble or partly overlap with noun incorporation and poly­
synthesis. By just describing them as such, however, the concepts of incorporation and
polysynthesis would have to be broadened, but the general principle behind the mecha­
nisms would still not be grasped.
The comparison of dependent-head synthesis with noun incorporation showed
that tests or criteria of referential activeness and argumenthood of the synthesizing noun,
of polysynthesis, head marking and configurationality do not necessarily apply the way
they are expected to just because the primary object synthesizes with its governing verb
and, as a dependent, is directly marked on its head. This insight suggests that the Nivkh
root concatenation phenomenon should be described in terms of what it actually is, viz.
dependent-head synthesis, and recognized as an organization principle in its own right.
The question then arises of whether this organizational principle, general as it is,
may be found underlying the structure of other languages as well. This, however, cannot
be determined based only on extant materials.
A further question concerns the status of dependent-head synthesis with respect
to polysynthesis. The reconciliation of both structural types is subject to the discrepancy
between the homogeneity of the principle of dependent-head synthesis and the heteroge­
neity of the ingredients and cross-linguistic moldings of polysynthesis. It first has to be
decided how broadly or narrowly polysynthesis is to be interpreted.
The structural parallelisms of Nivkh with Chukchi, Ket, So:ra, Wichita, Nez
Perce, Lakhota, Comanche, Kiowa, and Ainu, besides the differences in the internal
organization of the verb forms and in the role non-root bound morphemes with fairly
concrete, 'lexical' meanings play, lie in the complex verb forms arising from the synthesization of noun and verb roots. Especially between Chukchi and Nivkh, differences
seem to be of degree rather than kind. The parallelism among the languages mentioned
would be veiled by a sharp delimitation of polysynthesis. On the other hand, such a deli­
mitation from non-polysynthetic agglutinating languages by way of minimality con­
straints seems desirable.
For complex noun forms, formed by integrating modifiers such as lexical roots
or non-root bound morphemes in addition to the expected categories of number, case,TYPOLOGICAL OUTLOOK289definiteness or gender, the notion of polysynthesis would have to be enlarged, as sug­
gested in chapter 9. Polysynthesis then would actually assume the status of a separate
morphological type. Complex noun forms, however, exist in otherwise non-polysynthetic languages as well, such as Sanskrit and German, which suggests that they follow a
principle of their own, independent of the verb form. A separate term for this phenome­
non would then be needed.
All the languages mentioned above manifest both complex (polysynthetic) verb
forms and noun forms all of which arise from root concatenation (see chapters 8 and 9;
Spencer 1995, Werner 1997, Rood 1976, Boas/Deloria 1979, Charney 1993, Watkins
1984, Tamura 2000; Nez Perce, however, has non-root bound morphemes only, see Aoki
1970). This means that a uniform formation principle is valid for both verb and noun
forms in these languages (as is the case with Nivkh), which is not taken into account in
the traditional approach to polysynthesis.
Furthermore, a uniform formation principle is found in Greenlandic, Kwakwala,
Tsimshian, and Tariana, in which both noun and verb complexes arise from the affixing
of non-root bound morphemes (see chapter 9; Fortescue 1984; Boas 1911c, 1911b;
Aikhenvald 1999).
Thus, both the compositional and the affixal strategies are not only valid for
both verb and noun forms, but may also apply to both at the same time and thus describe
an overall structural principle of a language.
Such languages stand in contrast to (verbal) polysynthetic languages such as
Karok (Bright 1957:56-57), in which noun forms are barely inflected or derived at all.
Languages such as the latter seem to be a minority, however, since in most polysynthetic
languages examined here nouns (if they can be delimited as a separate lexical category
at all) are not so simple (see chapter 9; in contrast to what Mithun predicts 1988:443). In
fact, no language in the sample lacks number, case, possessive marking or derivational
affixes (such as diminutive or 'tense') altogether, even if these categories are less salient
than in e.g. some European languages (with the exception of English) in disposing of
few or no central cases, in marking collective instead of number or number on animate
nouns only, etc. Nevertheless, the noun form in a polysynthetic language is generally
more simply structured than the verb form if templates are compared, but this applies to
non-poly synthetic languages as well.
It seems to make sense to acknowledge the overall structural principle as a type
in its own right, perhaps even as a morphological type, as it is superordinate to polysyn­
thesis (as it is presently understood). We might call this overall principle polysynthesis,
but in that case the delimitation to verb-only polysynthesis must be reinterpreted.
Leaving these points for further reflection, we close with the final observation
that it is on such a superordinate principle, independent of polysynthesis and operating
on both noun and verb forms, that Nivkh dependent-head synthesis is cast as well.","[298, 299, 300]"
"The last sentence was not read from a card, but uttered spontaneously in a conversation
between the consultant and the interviewer.
For phonetic proof of the accent position in a language, it must be determined
which parameters identify the accentuated syllable. Possible parameters are fundamental
frequency, formants, intensity and duration of segments (see Sachse 1998). As the rele­
vant parameters and their correlation vary by language, speaker, situation, and linguistic
context, a larger sample of speech data has to be evaluated. Unfortunately, we only have
data from one single speaker for the present analysis, and the relevant parameters for the
determination of accent in Nivkh have never been examined.
Thus, as a first approximation, a waveform, an intensity plot, a fundamental fre­
quency plot, and a spectrogram were calculated for each sentence. The respective dia­
grams are displayed in that order for each sentence in the appendix, and they gave rise to
the following observations:
The comparison of Bondarko & Zinder's waveforms and ours confirms the ob­
servation that in (undergoer) noun + verb complexes there is a greater amplitude in the
noun stretch, e.g. in the waveforms for (38a), (38d), whereas in noun + noun complexes,
e.g. vo-nlami ""half of the village"" in (38d), there are no significant amplitudinal differen­
ces, e.g. in (38f), (38g), where there are structurally parallel forms to Bondarko &
Zinder's examples.",[101]
"If a complex is dissolved, a change in stress pattern accompanies the change in form (see
chapter 4.4). In the example below, the (a) version displays a N+V complex with its
typical noun stress; in the (b) version, the undergoer is encoded as a topic outside the
verb, and a coindexed undergoer marker is found on the verb. Topic and predicate are
stressed separately.

word forms in Nivkh and is a valid criterion for morphological wordhood.
Jakobson, like Krejnovič, considers the complexes (his 'syntactic sections') to
be stress and pause units (1971:78).
Furthermore, in 1962, at the time when the question of incorporation in Nivkh
was being hotly debated by Krejnovič and Panfilov, Bondarko & Zinder examined com­

cate constructions, ""both words have the same intensity"" (1962:85) [actually referring to
the amplitude instead of the intensity], i.e. the waveforms show two stretches of acoustic
signal, one for /aŋ/ ""who"" and one for /χaʤ/ ""s.o. shoots it"", with the amplitudes of the
two (identical) vowels being equal. In type (ii), with the assumed undergoer-verb com­
plex, there are three sections of which the first two, /if/ ""s/he"" and /aŋ/ ""who"", show
equal vowel amplitudes, while for the section /qhaʤ/ ""shoot"" the amplitude is clearly
lower. This pattern constitutes a regularity observed in all speakers, differing only in de­
gree (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85). The problematic point about this interpretation is that,
because the low-amplitudinal section is at the sentence boundary, it may represent a
sentence-final creaky voice phase.
Bondarko & Zinder see their findings confirmed by an evaluation of the duration
of the vowels. In type (ii) constructions, the duration of the vowel of the verb forming a
complex with its undergoer is shorter than in the corresponding type (i) constructions
with the bare verb. For three speakers, the vowel of the 'non-incorporating' verb in type
(i) constructions was 1.5 to two times longer; the minimal difference of duration,
observed with a fourth informant, was 20 ms. This vowel reduction is not dependent on
the phonetic context of the utterance (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85). Amplitudinal and du­
rational differences, if accepted as significant, support Krejnovič's stress rule that in
noun + verb complexes, stress falls on the noun (see above).
For constructions of both type (iv) (lexicalized noun compounds) and (v) (nonlexicalized complexes), Bondarko & Zinder note a low amplitude for vowels in the
second element of both types in comparison to the same element as a simplex form, but
the overall difference is less clear-cut. The duration analysis, too, shows less consistent
and more ambiguous results (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85-89).
In comparing type (ii) and type (iii) constructions, Bondarko & Zinder point out
that in ñivx ləyi-ŋəŋḍ ""man hunts salmon"", there are two amplitudinal maxima, one on
the /i/ of ñivx and one on the /a/ of ləyi (as is typical for construction type (ii)), whereasDEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD89in ləyi-ŋəŋ-ñivx ""man who hunts salmon"", there is only one, namely on the first /ə/
(1962:89).
Bondarko & Zinder conclude from these results that independent word forms are
distinguishable from elements in word complexes. They also find that in word-comple­
xes, such as aŋ-q'aḍ ""s.o. shoots whom?"", two (or more) elements are ""fused into one
whole"", constituting a phonetic unit (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85). This experimental re­
search supports Krejnovič's analysis of the Nivkh complexes as 'wholes'. It has not re­
ceived, however, much attention among Nivkhologists.
Elaborating on this experimental basis, we will now proceed to an analysis of
Nivkh speech material. The speaker is a middle-aged Nivkh teacher of Nekrasovska
(North Sakhalin), whose linguistic background comprises North Sakhalin and Amur
Nivkh. She read out a sample of 55 different sentences (taken from the extant language
materials), which were written on cards, to the non-native speaker interviewer, repeating
each item about ten times in random order. On the cards, the modern conventional ortho­
graphy was used which follows Panfilov's tradition of writing as separate words as much
as possible. The speaker's articulation was clear and rather slow. The recordings were
analyzed digitally with regards to different parameters. For this presentation, a number
of the more complex sentences which illustrate different structural types of complexes
have been chosen, as well as inflected word forms and compounds.

TYPOLOGICAL OUTLOOK10.1
The structure ofNivkh
In summarizing our findings about the morphosyntax of Nivkh, we should state that its
basic structural principle is dependent-head synthesis. Dependent and head are adjacent
morphemes within one word unit at whose common boundary morphophonemic proces­
ses affect the final and initial consonants of the morphemes.
Two adjacent constituents that are not in a dependent-head relationship may not
synthesize, a fact especially true for coordinated modifiers or undergoers. If dependent
and head are non-adjacent - when an undergoer is topicalized, dislocated or focused, or
any other constituent takes the focus position in front of the verb and ousts the undergoer
noun form - they cannot form a complex. In these cases the undergoer is marked on the
verb by a prefix in addition to an overt NP. In other words, dependent-head synthesis of
primary object and verb does not occur if they have different information values.
Dependent and head may stand in either a governmental or a modificational rela­
tionship, such as in the following:
(1)dependent
primary object noun stem/NML

guished based on their heads and slots.
(2)a.
b.primary object-serial slot-V-TAM inflection
determiner/possessor-attribute-N-number/case/focus inflectionThe last lexical root in a synthetic complex is the head of the construction and deter­
mines the type of inflection. The verb complex offers slots for both a governed and a
modifying element; the noun complex has them for modifying elements (and a governed
element in the case of a relational or complement-taking noun). The recursive synthesis274DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHof dependents and heads alone (i.e. without other markers) signals the existence of a
dependent-head relationship without specifying the kind of relation.
The noun complex cannot be dissolved, nor can the modifying relation be para­
phrased, with the exception of quantifiers, which may occur within a noun complex or
outside as copredicates and free constituents. The dependents in both the noun and the
verb complex may bear inflection, but not inflection for case, focus, mood or clausal nexion, which only marks the right edge of a complex.
Thus, in their complexity and ingredients, the noun and verb forms resemble
phrases of more analytic languages, and since the subject is not consistently integrated
into the verb form (i.e. there is no fully grammaticalized polypersonalism), we may
speak of 'word-phrases' rather than of 'word-sentences' in Nivkh. From a functional
point of view, however, both complex synthetic constructions in Nivkh serve equally
well as predicates and as arguments (for verbs theḑ-form only). The syntactic organiza­
tion in Nivkh thus seems to be intermediate between languages where clause and sen­
tence level rules are more prominent than morphology in phrase/clause constitution (e.g.
European languages) and languages where morphology is more prominent (e.g. Iroquoian languages).
According to Nichols' typology of head/dependent-marking (1986), Nivkh de­
pendent-head synthesis must be classified as head-marking (akin to noun incorporation
and polysynthesis, which Nichols counts as head-marking, 1986:64). Nivkh is head-mar­
king in the sense that the dependent is fully specified on the head. Nichols herself recog­
nizes a ""head-marked pattern"" in connection with ""some sandhi"" in Nivkh (= Gilyak;
1986:100) but, not taking the systemic status of this pattern into account, considers the
language ""largely isolating"" in morphological type. Even disregarding the word comple­
xes, which have been presented in this study, Nivkh has a considerable amount of mor­
phology, rendering it agglutinating rather than isolating.
Nivkh fits well into the ranking of different linguistic constructions which
Nichols establishes according to their propensity to be head-marked (1986:75), as dis­
played in table 10.1. Nichols claims that the levels constitute a hierarchy (1986:75-76):
head-marking morphology starts out from the clause level, but if a language has depen­
dent-marking on that level, it will have it on the other levels as well. Within each of
Nichols' levels, the constructions become more prone to dependent-marking from top to
bottom. Note that, if this order of levels and constructions is applied to Nivkh, Nichols'
inner and outer rankings are borne out, and head-marking is employed, rather impres­
sively, up to the 'relative construction'.","[283, 284, 285]"
"Onomatopoetic morphemes, which are generally used as interjections in reduplicated
form or predicatively with the auxiliary haḑ ""be so"", serve as the derivational basis for
verbs as well (cf. Panfilov 1965:14-15, 36, 199-204; Gruzdeva 1998:30, 37).

Syntax
Nivkh is a head-marking SOV language (in the sense of Nichols 1986) with a fairly
consistent final predicate position. All dependents precede their heads, and syntax is or­
ganized according to a S/A pivot.
Predicate phrases are singled out by being inflected for TAM categories; argu­
ment and adverbial phrases bear number, case, scalar operator and focus marking. Syn­
tactic relations are signalled by head-marking and word order (central participants), case
suffixes (peripheral participants) and relational morphemes (local relations). Central syn­
tactic relations (subject, primary and secondary objects) and topics are not case-marked.
Overt participant phrases or free subject pronouns are not obligatory in Nivkh, the finite
verb form being a minimal sentence as such. One undergoer, however, is obligatorily
marked on a transitive verb (see 1.3.4).
The structure of a complex sentence is as follows (with
word boundary):
(61)topic embedded clause adverbials
object primary object-predicatesubjectcauseesecondaryBesides verbs, nouns (in the nominative) are used as predicates without a copula. They
may bear scalar operators or focus suffixes.

Psychological reality
An important criterion for judging the status of Nivkh noun and verb complexes is the
reaction and assessment of the native speakers.
Krejnovic furnishes valuable information on this point (1937:14-15). He reports
that Sternberg, who studied Nivkh around the turn of the 20th century, for lack of recor­
ding implements, made his consultants dictate the texts ""word by word""; Sternberg him­
self noted (1908) that this word-by-word dictation proved to be a painful procedure for
the consultants. Note that Bogoras wrote about male Chukchi speakers (a polysynthetic
language and similar in construction type to Nivkh) that ""most of them were quite
unable to dictate"" (1904-9:52). Krejnovic adds that Sternberg found the initial sounds in
Nivkh to be fickle, and their alternation to be unpredictable. He gives some examples
how Sternberg falsified the data by taking down erroneous forms, mostly lacking correct
consonant alternation (1937:15). Austerlitz (1983:75) even goes so far as to call Stern­
berg a ""poor phonetician"" and ""naive grammarian"" whose materials ""require intensive
control"".
Krejnovic furnishes the following explanation for Sternberg's errors: Obviously
Sternberg had a preconceived notion of what a word in Nivkh 'should be', influenced by
his own language, Russian, in which phrases fall neatly into words. This strong supposi­
tion about word entities in general determined his method and he inadvertedly made
native speakers tear the actual Nivkh entities apart, which they were quite unwilling to
do. As a result, they dictated lexicon forms and forms which preserved consonant alter­
nation at random, preventing the unique characteristics of the language from manifesting
themselves and rendering the description of consonant alternation impossible for
Sternberg.
It is difficult to assess the feeling for wordhood that native speakers have in the
current language situation after decades of education in Russian have left their mark. The
native speaker who furnished the data examined in section 3.4 is a good example. She
was educated both in Russian and as a teacher of Nivkh. She made the interviewer repeat
her sentences; and in some cases when she wanted to correct his pronunciation she
picked out a string of morphemes which corresponds to one graphic word in the modern
Nivkh orthography, which, as we learned above, follows Panfilov's 'splitting' tradition,
and asked for it to be repeated after her irrespective of consonant alternation. This sug­
gests that her conception of words follows what she has learned about Russian and the
way she writes the Nivkh language. Furthermore, it is generally the case that linguists
tend not to get the most authentic material from language teachers as consultants.
Michael Dunn (personal communication, 2001 ms.) even suspects that the notion
of 'word' was actually introduced to Siberian cultures by the introduction to literacy,
since Chukchi had originally had only one word for both 'word' and 'speech'. He re­
ports that in modern Chukchi, an acknowledged incorporating and polysynthetic lan­
guage, more than two lexical stems rarely feature in one word (although this is the very
essence of the language documented by Skorik 1961, 1977; cf. chapters 9, 10). Words
containing a greater number of lexical morphemes occur in two special genres, tradi­
tional 'tongue twisters' and riddles, and make people laugh (2001 ms.).","[129, 130]"

-non (instead of Amur -tot) (Krejnovič 1979:318, Gruzdeva 1998:56). The general con­
verb suffix forms a special converb with the otherwise non-occurring suffix -vu-, namely
-vut (1s, p1) / -vur (2s, 3s), which is used as the predicate form of complements of verbs
of communication. Two aspectoid categories which are used in embedded clauses only
occur on the general converb, yielding the dynamic continuative converb -durŋu-t/
-durŋu-r ""while V-ing"" and the stative continuative converb -data-t/-data-r ""in the state
of being V-ed"". Also the ""lest'-suffix is used with this converb as -ilәkr-t/-ilәkr-r. The
general converb is the most frequently occurring converb, and also the one used with
auxiliary verbs to encode aspectoids and modalities (see above).
The supine (cf. Gruzdeva 1998:52) is used for non-future negation in the Amur
variety in the form Y-dox + qauḑ ""sth. does not exist"", alternatively V-dd + lәgeḑ ""sth.

"102DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHIn conclusion, Nivkh consonant alternations stand out in that they apply strictly within
determined syntactic domains which correspond to phrases in other languages, and that
they are conditioned equally well phonologically and syntactically. They furthermore do
not seem to be prone to lexicalization or grammaticalization of the alternate initial, with
the exception of the already lexicalized fricative-initial of transitive verbs.
3.7
A preliminary conclusion
Thus far, Nivkh complexes were examined from phonological and morphophonological
viewpoints. They are probably not phonological words in the theoretical sense of Hall
(1999a), but neither are compounds or even inflectional forms, which are nevertheless
recognized as single word forms in Nivkh. The complexes share, however, a number of
phonological and morphophonological properties with compounds and inflectional
forms, such as phonotactics, resyllabification, stress, pitch and pause structure, and morphophonemic processes applying within them. On this basis they can be considered to be
single phonological words in the sense of Matthews (1991).
Nivkh morphophonemic alternations may be subsumed under sandhi phenome­
na, but this does not do justice to their unique form and function. Nivkh morphophone­
mics are phonological markers of morphosyntactic units, as Welsh consonant mutations
and Kimatuumbi vowel shortening are in part. It seems appropriate to draw a distinction
between such phenomena and sandhi. The difference between Nivkh on the one hand
and Welsh and Kimatuumbi on the other is that alternations in Nivkh are phonologically
conditioned, which they are not in the other languages.
Having thus examined the phonological and morphophonological properties of
Nivkh complexes, it is time to turn to the morphological level.
3.8
The morphological word in Nivkh
Morphologically, a word is conceived of as a coherent unit of morphemes whose linear
order cannot be interrupted or rearranged without a change in semantics, and which is a
free form in syntax, inflected as a whole and substitutable and permutable as a whole
within a larger syntactic unit. One problematic point concerns referential properties - we
will save this for chapter 5. Word boundaries are identified on the morphological level
by distinguishing roots, bound morphemes, and clitics, and by classifying them with re­
gard to their position in a coherent unit, as prefixal or suffixal, proclitic and enclitic, res­
pectively.
In the following, Nivkh complexes will be subjected to wordhood tests. We will
confine ourselves to an overview of their morphological properties, since the bulk of the
evidence will be dealt with in detail in the chapters devoted to each of the Nivkh com­
plex types. A general remark about our conception of 'word' is in order here.
In her papers about incorporating languages, Mithun stresses that complex
words in such languages, e.g. verb forms with incorporated noun forms, are necessarily
lexicalized items which are stored in the lexicon as wholes and denote name-worthy
concepts (1984:889,2000:917; Mithun/Corbett 1999:52, 58). This is the basis for consi­
dering incorporation to be a morphological phenomenon, in contrast to a syntactic ap-DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD103proach such as is favored by Sadock(1980,1985,1986) or Baker (1988,1996). This ne­
cessary connection of incorporative constructions and lexicalized status seems to be a
rather strong postulation about wordhood when different incorporating languages are
compared, and Majewicz (1980:140) takes an opposite viewpoint in stating that incorpo­
ration is ad hoc. Seen the other way round, the fact that a word form is not lexicalized
does not mean that it must have been formed on the syntactic level. Take for instance a
language like German, in which complex nominal words are formed from multiple stems
ad hoc, very productively and as freely as phrases. Despite being formed after the model
of (lexicalized) compounds, they do not necessarily enter the lexicon (although they may
in the long run). They may reach an impressive complexity, but are recognized as single
words by native speakers and are parsed easily, e.g. the famous
(54)German
Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitän
[Donau-[[dampf-[schiff-fahrt]] s-gesellschaft]] s-kapitän
Danube-steam-ship-drive-society-captain
""captain of the Danube steam line association""or the following words, picked randomly from newspapers and magazines:
(55)German
MIR-Experte
Japan-Wochen
(Japan weeks)""expert on the Mir (space station)""
""Japanese weeks""
(with events related to Japanese culture and way of
life)
CDU-Schwarz.geld.affäre
""the affair thrown up by the detection of inoffi(CDU-black.money.affair)
cial bank accounts of the political party CDU""
Such formations are very frequently encountered in print media or the administrational
language. They may contain proper names, plural forms, interrogatives, even acronyms,
and they generally substitute for genitive constructions or attributive adverbials, e.g.
(56)German
Kapitän bei der Gesellschaft für Dampfschiffahrt auf der Donau
captain at the society for steam_shipping on the Danube
""captain of the society for steam-shipping on the Danube""which sound rather clumsy. They are also the reason why there is no 'longest word' in
German, as there is, for example, in French (viz. anticonstitutionnellement ""unconstitu­
tionally""), which does not allow such productive formation.
In Nivkh, in a parallel fashion to German, we observe lexicalized word forma­
tion products on the one hand and ad hoc-formed complexes on the other (more analo­
gies will be dealt with below), both formed after the same model. The complexes are104DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHformed productively and as freely as phrases, and are not lexical entries. These proper­
ties do not, however, a priori preclude them from being single words with respect to
morphosyntax. In other words, non-lexicalized concatenations of lexemes need not ne­
cessarily be considered phrases. In the sense of Matthews (1991), Nivkh complexes and
German ad hoc formations are not lexical items, but single word-forms. In both lan­
guages this can be shown by phonological, morphophonological, and morphological
properties.
Turning now to the morphological structure of word forms in Nivkh, we can
identify the following minimal free forms: a noun, identical in form to one allomorph of
its root, which represents the unmarked case form (unmarked in the sense of absence of
phonological substance), a verb, consisting of a verb root and at least a mood or converb
suffix, and a particle, which is invariable. Verbal roots or stems without a mood or converb marker do not constitute free forms (Krejnovic 1958,1966; Nedjalkov/Otaina 1988:
136; see chapter 6.1); neither do other allomorphs of noun roots. Krejnovic (1966:37-38)
presents an overview of bound and free forms of lexical morphemes, part of which is
cited in (57)4.

number of which depends on the quality of their initial and final sounds as well as on ablauting vowels (as in ev ""s.o. holds sth."", cf. 4.1.6) and verb class (for verbs only).
The minimal free forms can be elaborated considerably. The first template below
shows a single-stem noun form, the second a single-stem verb form, with the slot of the
final and finite verb suffix being differentiated according to its filler into a) a mood
form, b) the special indicative and nominalizing -form (with its nominal inflectional

Verbs
The Nivkh verb category comprises event, property, and quantity-denoting lexemes,
such as lәtţ""s.o. makes sth."",Paʁḑ""sth. is red"", haskţ ""sth. is few in number""; lexemes
derived from landmark roots, such as jeţţ ""s.o. pulls sth. up onto the riverbank""; enaḑ
""s.o./sth. is different/another""; the interrogative verbs ja ʁoḑ""how is sth.?"" and jaḑ ""what
is s.o. doing?""; and demonstrative verbs (e.g. toyaḑ ""sth. is such""). There is no separate
adjective class.
Nivkh verbs inflect for causative, temporal and aspectoid categories, degree,
modality, mood, scalar operator, and focus, and they form converbs. The term 'aspec­
toid' will be used here for categories such as completive, progressive or habitual, i.e. for
categories which in grammaticalization theory (see Bybee/Perkins/Pagliuca 1994) pre­
cede an aspect category on its grammaticalization path. There is no aspect opposition
(perfective - imperfective) in Nivkh.
Polarity and further aspectoid and modal categories are encoded with the help of
auxiliaries. There is no passive, applicative or other voice. Transitive verbs have an obli­
gatory reflex of one undergoer. The basic verb template is
(23)undergoer_prefix-root-(aspectoid/degree)-(causative)-(aspectoid/degree/temporal)-(scalar_operator)-(modality)-mood/scalar_operator/focus/converb_suffixThe undergoer of a transitive verb is encoded either in prefixai, pronominal or nominal
form, or represented by a characteristic initial sound (see chapter 4). The undergoer pre­
fixes are:INTRODUCTION(24)undergoer prefixes

complex verb form (cf. Nedjalkov/Otaina/Xolodovic 1969, for the complex verb see

This affixal type is also represented in languages such as Kwakwala (Wakashan;

(North-West Caucasian; Hewitt 1989, Lucassen 1985).
Chukchi, in contrast, allows several lexical roots within one word form and
makes use of noun incorporation ((11) - (13)), verb root serialization ((13), (15)) and
even adverb incorporation ((14); cf. Skorik 1961, 1977; Spencer 1995; see also chapter
6). In the examples below, all morphemes between the initial and final inflectional mor­
phemes are roots; janot ""first"" occurs as a free adverb in other contexts.

tions (reflexive, reciprocal, antipassive; altogether 6 affixes) and aspectual categories (9
affixes), as well as degree (8 affixes), quantification (2 affixes), manner (2 affixes), reversative (1 affix), direction (1 affix) and one scalar operator (all counts based on

coded by non-root bound morphemes in Chukchi (as in Greenlandic), but such affixes
are extremely few in number (especially compared to Greenlandic), and the dominant
mechanism is root concatenation. Nevertheless, it is exactly in this point that Japanese
differs from Chukchi by encoding all relevant categories via root concatenation. It thus
depends on the postulation of the existence of non-root bound morphemes whether there
is such a thing as purely compositional polysynthesis (without any of these). For the
time being, we may define the compositional type as exhibiting noun incorporation, verb
root serialization and at least one non-root bound morpheme expressing a domain from
the catalogue. These traits are not only found in Chukchi, but are also common to lan­
guages such as Wichita (Caddoan; see Rood 1976), Nez Perce (Sahaptian; see Aoki
1970), Lakhota (Siouan; see Boas/Deloria 1979), Cherokee (Iroquoian; see King 1975),
Slave (Athapaskan; Rice 1989), Tanoan languages (Harrington 1910a,b; Allen/
Gardiner/Frantz 1984), Comanche, Tümpisa Shoshone, Classical Náhuatl (Uto-Aztecan;
Charney 1993, Dayley 1989, Andrews 1975), Pano (Panoan; see Loos 1999), Ket284DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH(Paleosiberian; see Werner 1997), So:ra (Munda; Pinnow 1966) and Bininj Gun-wok
(Gunwinjguan; see Evans 1999), all with locationals, as well as to Kiowa and Ainu. Note
that the Comanche verb is monopersonal and the Tümpisa Shoshone verb apersonal.
The existence of compositionally poly synthetic languages proves false Baker's
claim (1996:338) that languages with rich noun incorporation are ""poor(er) in other
complex predicates"" (e.g. Mohawk), and vice versa (e.g. Yimas, which has verb root se­
rialization but no noun incorporation).
Furthermore, all these languages from the Americas, Asia, and Australia are
more (Wichita, Nez Perce) or less (Chukchi, So:ra, Classical Náhuatl) well-equipped
with affixes expressing categories from the poly synthesis catalogue (3). Wichita, for
example, has 30 local prefixes, three classifier prefixes, and prefixes for ""first"", ""for a
while"", ""quickly"", and ""accidentally"".

""by making many trips, he brought the large (quantity of) meat up to the top""This opens up a continuum of different types between affixal and compositional polysynthesis with regard to the weight of noun and adverb incorporation, verb root seria­
lization, and non-root bound morphemes. Languages such as Wichita are located more
towards the affixal end of the compositional area.
Halfway along this continuum we find languages with mixed strategies, i.e.
languages which have non-root bound morphemes and either noun incorporation or verb
root serialization (but not both of these compositional mechanisms). To the former class
(affixes and noun incorporation) belong languages such as Sarcee and Hupa (Athapaskan; see Cook 1984; Goddard 1911, Golla 1996), Tsimshian (see Boas 191 lb), Takelma
(see Sapir 1922), and Blackfoot (Algonquian; see Taylor 1969), all of which are polypersonal languages.
A good example is Takelma, whose verb form offers slots for a patient incorpo­
ree, a local prefix (Sapir 1922:86 lists 16 different ones), an instrumental incorporee, a
manner, modal or phase prefix (""truly"", ""probably"", ""continuously""), and suffixes for
valence operations, person and tense/mood.

(liaison: [va] ""go"" + [z] + [i] ""there"")
""he did not see"" (schwa elision of ne ""not"")The principle behind obligatoriness is quite simple. Liaison, elision and enchaînement
are obligatory for clitics only, viz. determiners, negation and person marking on the verb
(with the help of so-called unstressed forms of pronouns). These are not free forms but
always attach to a host (cf. Morin/Kaye 1982:318), with which they form a word.
Liaison is virtually obligatory between monosyllabic prepositions and their com­
plements. Liaison and enchaînement are optional and register-dependent between (i) pre­
nommai modifying adjective and noun, (ii) plural noun and postnominal modifying ad­
jective (Booij 1986:99), (iii) auxiliary and verb, (iv) adverb and adjective, (v) copula and
its predicate noun, and (vi) in a number of other heterogeneous contexts. Thus they
apply within phrases most of the time, but also across phrase boundaries, e.g. after the
conjunction quand ""when"" (see table in Goldberg 1972:17). Optional liaison thus occurs
between separately inflecting words and is influenced by such factors as social variables,
syntactic contexts, the consonant concerned (/t/ and /z/ liaison being the most frequent),
the length of the elements involved, and pausing (Morin/Kaye 1982, Booij/De Jong
1987).
French optional liaison and enchaînement are not strict phrase markers: they do
not occur between a singular noun and modifier, or between a verb and object, for ex-98DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHample, but may occur across phrase boundaries. They are found most frequently between
a modifying adjective and noun, and in this environment take over functions of number
and gender marking on forms which have lost their former agreement suffixes through
phonological erosion (Morin/Kaye 1982:320-323). Thus, optional sandhi in French also
somehow restitutes inflectional morphology, indicative of the word boundaries.
The obligatory and optional 'sandhi' in French are identical in morphophonemic
phenomena but different in functionality, a fact which is concealed by approaching both
as sandhi phenomena. Furthermore, both conditioning and functionality of the French
mechanisms are clearly distinct from those of Nivkh consonant alternation.
In conclusion, in view of the imprecision of the term 'sandhi', we would forego
a better classification if we applied it to the Nivkh phenomenon. These consonant alter­
nations are strictly phonologically and syntactically conditioned; they apply without ex­
ception3 and are independent of the speaker and the situation. Their function of linking
constituents of what would be phrases in European languages in the absence of case or
linkers anchors them firmly in Nivkh grammar. They are not simply phonetic decor at
the surface. Nivkh consonant alternation is also different from the phenomena termed
consonant alternation or mutation in other languages.
3.6
Consonant alternations outside Nivkh
Morphophonemic processes called consonant alternation or mutation are reported in
Celtic languages and languages in West Africa, where they are incidentally termed san­
dhi. We will compare these phenomena to Nivkh in terms of their functionality.
We have already looked at Welsh mutations above. From the point of view of
the phonological processes, Welsh mutations are quite similar to Nivkh. Four kinds of
mutations are distinguished in Welsh (Ball/Müller 1992:5):
1. Soft Mutation, which is actually lenition via voicing of/p, t, k, ɬ, ṛh (to /b, d, g, 1, r/),
spirantization of /b, d, m/ (to /v, ð, v/), and elision of /g/ (Ball/Müller 1992:12).
2. Nasal Mutation, which nasalizes the plosives /p, t, k, b, d, g/ (to /ṃh, ṇh, ŋh, m, n, ŋ/).
3. Aspirate Mutation of/p, t, k/ (to /f, θ, x/), which is lenition via spirantization.
These three types operate productively at the word boundary and are lexicalized wordinternally (Ball/Müller 1992:5).
4. Hard Mutation, which is fortition via devoicing and affects /b, d, g, v, ð/. Hard muta-3Panfilov (1965:45) cites apparent exceptions. In some of these cases, however, he misses a topic
construction made up from topic, subject and intransitive verb, in which there is never alternation
(see chapters 1.3.7, 4.4.1), e.g. in
(i) mer
lumz
roi-ḍ
1p.incl victuals not_suffice-IND/NML
""as for us, the victuals do not suffice""
In other cases, a probably denominal transitive verb begins with a non-alternating fricative (see
chapters 2.4.1, 2.1: fn. 2), e.g. vauḍ ""chew"", valvalḍ ""cut"" (cf. va ""sabre""), vayzaḍ ""s.o. stops up
sth."" (vay ""hemp"", zaḍ ""s.o. hits sth.""). The rest of the verbs appear in the dictionary as normally
alternating verbs (Savel'eva/Taksami 1970), e.g. fəvrkţ""s.o. plucks [feathers]"".","[108, 109]"
"205suru, with -tari the enumerative converb and sum ""s.o. does sth."" the dummy matrix
form bearing mood and negational inflection.
On the other hand, the enumerative form in Nivkh can be used without its
dummy and then looks like an independent mood form (see (8), after which Beffa puts
a full stop). The second alternative is found much more frequently.

Word forms like ţo-ŋәŋ-ḑ-yu ""they hunt fish"" in (2), u-raʁa--ḑu ""they equal each other
in thickness"" in (4), or ţolŋaj-xu-ra ""he killed a stag and..."" in (8), with both undergoerverb-synthesis and a subject marker, look quite polypersonal. What is more, the reflexes
of two participants involved in the state of affairs together form a bracket around the
whole construction, which contributes to the recognition of its wordhood (refer again to
example (63) of chapter 3.8).
Furthermore, with the ḑ-form, the enumerative, and the general and anterior
converbs, the four most frequently occurring verb forms bear an actor reflex. Thus, in
discourse, where actors are usually human, the majority of verb forms actually are
marked for subject person and are therefore polypersonal (if transitive). In the two texts
in Gruzdeva (1998:58-64), for example, only 14-15% of all occurring verb forms do not
bear a subject reflex, while half (or slightly more) of all occurring verb forms are either
a general converb or an enumerative form.
Hence, Nivkh does show traits of polypersonalism, even if less strongly pro­
nounced than in other polysynthetic languages. Maximally one undergoer is reflected on
the verb; the second undergoer of a ditransitive verb (and also a causee) is always enco­
ded outside the verb form.
Polypersonalism is not restricted to polysynthetic languages, of course, but most
polysynthetic languages encode more than one participant on the verb: maximally two
persons in Greenlandic (Eskimo; see Fortescue 1984) or Mohawk (Iroquoian; see Baker
1996), up to three in Southern Tiwa (Tanoan; see Allen/Gardiner/Frantz 1984), Classical
Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan; see Andrews 1975), and Abkhaz (North-West-Caucasian; see
Lucassen 1985).
But even with polypersonalism being absent, a language can be polysynthetic.
Whereas Mithun (1988:446-447) and Fortescue (1994:2601) more or less require a poly­
synthetic language to be polypersonal and Baker (1996:14) even redefines 'polysynthesis' as, roughly, a composite phenomenon of polypersonalism and noun incorporation,
Drossard (1997:251-252) allows for what he calls 'non-sentential' polysynthesis, as in. 206DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHlanguages like Klamath, Haida, Awtuw (Papua) or Arabana (Pama-Nyungan) (cf. also
Mithun 1999:213-217), thus taking up Boas' idea on polysynthesis (191 la:75):
On the other hand the Athapaskan and the Haida and Tlingit may be taken as
examples of languages which, though polysynthetic in the sense here de­
scribed, do not readily incorporate the object, but treat both pronominal subject
and pronominal object as independent elements.
In the above-mentioned languages, the verbal word integrates adverbial material and
may be quite complex, but does not constitute a minimal sentence as it lacks participant
cross-reference (participants have to be encoded at least in the form of free pronouns).

'non-sentential' polysynthesis there also is no integration of nominal material into the
verb form (1997:253), e.g. via incorporation; in Nivkh, however, there is, which means
that Nivkh does not behave like these apersonal polysynthetic languages.
Besides apersonal polysynthesis, verbs with object agreement but without sub­
ject agreement, a constellation closer to the Nivkh case, are reported in Kutenai (isolate)
and the Sahaptian languages (Barker 1964 for Nez Perce, Mithun 1999:239, 511).
Nivkh is special in that the verbal word does constitute a minimal sentence even
without overt subject marking, with overt expression of participants not being required
verb-externally. Thus, the polypersonalism criterion does not exclude Nivkh from the
class of polysynthetic languages.
7.2
Modality, adverbial and locational elements
Polysynthetic languages are characterized by the integration of expressions of modali­
ties, aspectual categories (in the widest sense), and different adverbial, instrumental (e.g.
""by hand""), motional, locational, and quantificational elements into their verb form
(Mithun 1988:443, 447-450, Fortescue 1994:2602, Drossard 1997).
Nivkh does not manifest any instrumental elements in its verb complex, nor any
elements expressing chronological or time-related ideas such as ""first"" or ""again"". On
the other hand, Nivkh definitely encodes aspectual categories and degree (see chapter
1.3.4) as well as modalities in its verb form, as we saw in chapter 6.4, and has an impres-NIVKH - A POLYSYNTHETIC LANGUAGE ?","[216, 217, 218]"
"CHAPTER 9
COMPLEX NOUN FORMS IN THE WORLD'S L A N G U A G E STo my knowledge, a typological study of complex noun forms has not been carried out
thus far, nor has a comparison of nominais in polysynthetic languages been made. In this
chapter we will concentrate on an intersection of the two, viz. complex noun forms in
polysynthetic languages. Against this background, the Nivkh phenomenon may be better
assessed.
A first difficulty which arises with nouns in polysynthetic languages is that there
may not be such a class, or, if there is, only a small one (as has been described for Salish
languages (see Kinkade 1983), Wakashan (Jacobsen 1979), Cayuga (Iroquoian; Sasse
1993), etc.). Instead, translation equivalents to nouns in European languages are roots
forming predicative expressions which are distinguished from 'verbal' predicates by a
restricted paradigm, e.g. in terms of aspectual and person inflection (Sasse 1993:209210). To avoid false predictions connected with this problem, the languages examined in
the present sample were chosen because of the existence of a lexical category which also
forms non-predicative expressions. Generally, such nouns bear possessor markers (see
also Fortescue 1994:2601) and a few case or 'adpositional' affixes. They may also be­
come quite complex in some languages by either accumulating non-root bound mor­
phemes on the nominal root or by concatenating roots. In this chapter, examples for both
types will be presented.
9.1
Noun complexity due to non-root bound morphemes
Greenlandic (Eskimo) is a good example of a language in which, by way of the accumu­
lation of non-root bound morphemes on a nominal root, noun forms may become im­
pressively complex, although by no means as complex as verb forms.
Abstracting from the fact that in Greenlandic complex verb forms may be nominalized or word forms may become complex from consecutive nominalizing and verbali­
zing, there are about 70 suffixes in Greenlandic which attach productively to nominal
roots (or nominalizers) without changing the lexical category. These modificational suf­
fixes express relatively concrete categories, such as an alienable or meronymic relation;
different relations of a person to the N (""owner of a big/good N"", ""seller of', ""traveller
to"", ""inhabitant of""); a place, interval, container, or means for N; quantity, sociative, par­
titive, similitude, or qualities or properties such as ""small"", ""big"", ""former/old"", ""future"",
""new"", ""dear"", ""good"", ""bad"", ""whole"", ""genuine"", ""approximative"", ""only""; and finally
the way in which N was acquired, each in different nuances (see Fortescue 1980:277278). These categories may be arranged in a nominal template as follows:

"120DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHLee (1987) states about the Australian polysynthetic language Tiwi that between the tra­
ditional variety and Modern Tiwi (spoken by people under 30-35 years old), lexical affi­
xes (see chapter 10) and verb root serialization (see chapter 6), two vital ingredients of
polysynthesis, have been lost (1987:12-13, 167), and that the language today is instead
quite isolating. My own field-work with an Inuktitut speaker showed that she used ana­
lytic antipassive constructions and adverbials, avoiding denominal verbs and chains of
non-root bound morphemes (cf. chapters 7, 10) as well as ergative constructions.
These situations point to a decline of the languages and show that polysynthesis
is not the terminus of language evolution; a polysynthetic language may develop into a
more analytic one by exploiting its system-inherent potential of analytic constructions to
the disadvantage of the synthetic and complex ones, at least under the pressure of ana­
lytic languages like English and Russian.
Such a decline is true of Nivkh as well with its dramatically small number of
speakers. Gruzdeva (2000) describes grammatical features in the domains of person mar­
king (especially in the imperative), agreement, and word order which are different from
older language materials and have become more like the Russian system. In the actual
language situation, the classifier system has been considerably reduced, the causee case
(cf. 1.3.4) is even found marking the patient in an accusative-like manner, and consonant
alternations occur irregularly (Katja Gruzdeva, personal communication; for other chan­
ges in the syntax see also chapter 4.2.2.2).
Thus, the current state of the Nivkh language is not representative of what it
features a hundred years ago, and the interference from Russian might have led both to
a reduction of complex formations and a changed assessment of such entities. This not
only makes the older sources more valuable, but may also shed some light on the reasons
for the disagreement between Krejnovic and Panfilov, whose Nivkh studies were under­
taken a generation apart.
3.10
Conclusion
Nivkh word complexes have been examined in this chapter in the phonological and mor­
phological perspectives and from the point of view of psychological reality with respect
to their wordhood. The phonotactics and consonant alternations within complexes have
been shown to be no different from those within compounds, derivations, and inflected
items. In particular, complexes manifest voiced plosives and assimilation at their internal
morpheme boundaries, i.e. phenomena typical of the word-medial position. The left edge
of a word is defined by a restriction of consonant clusters; the right edge by fricative
devoicing. Since consonant alternations are strictly conditioned both phonologically and
syntactically and also mark constituents, to describe them with the vague term 'sandhi'
would be too general an interpretation.
Furthermore, complexes are stress units, pitch contour units and pause units;
have a hierarchic internal structure; cannot be interrupted by other material; and may
only be dissolved under well-determined conditions (focusing, topicalization, and coor­
dination). These possibilities of dissolution of a complex led some scholars to disacknowledge their wordhood. Irreconcilable with this assumption, however, are the factsDEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD121that components of complexes are bound allomorphs of lexical morphemes and that pre­
fixes and suffixes form a bracket around a complex. Both lines of argumentation may be
reconciled by distinguishing the phonological word in the sense of Hall (1999a), which
is not only smaller than a complex or compound, but may also not be a full-fledged word
in terms of grammar, and the grammatical word. Complexes are then grammatical
words, and parts not synthesizing under coordination are phonological words.
On the syntactic level, complexes may be permuted and substituted as wholes.
Their inflectional behavior is noteworthy insofar as complexes are marked for case, fo­
cus, mood or a converbal suffix only once, as wholes, but non-last (non-head) compo­
nents of complexes may bear inflectional suffixes for categories other than these (such
as number, scalar operator, causative, tense and aspectoid). With respect to their mor­
phological properties, complexes are not distinguished from compounds, derivations or
suffixation, and there is even a diachronic bond visible between complexes, suffixes and
relational morphemes, as some of the latter can be traced back to nominal and verbal
sources in a complex construction.
In our view, this is sufficient evidence for recognizing Nivkh complexes as
single morphological words. They are formed ad hoc, however, and are not lexemes,
although they may become lexicalized.","[130, 131, 132]"

"4DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHthe Amur and the East Sakhalin dialects and native speakers were educated as teachers.
Today, however, Nivkh is taught in only two schools on Sakhalin and only up to the
third grade. The fate of the two schools in the Amur region is uncertain. Nevertheless, a
monthly bilingual newspaper 'Nivkh Dif (""Nivkh Word"") has been in publication on
Sakhalin since 1990.
The recognition of ecological problems resulting from the industrial exploitation
of their forests, rivers, and oil resources has led the Siberian nations in the era of Glas­
nost to advocate their interests, including language and culture revival, culminating in
the foundation of the Association of Peoples of the North in 1989 with the Nivkh writer
Vladimir Sangi as chairman.
1.3
Characteristics of the Nivkh Language
Nivkh is a language isolate; even so, it is included in the geographically designed Paleosiberian language group consisting of the Chukcho-Kamchadal language family compri­
sing Chukchi, Koryak, Alyutor, Kerek, Kamchadal (Itelmen), as well as of the geneti­
cally unaffiliated and mutually unrelated isolates Ket (the only surviving Yeniseian lan­
guage) and Yukaghir (although some count it among the Uralic languages).
The study of the Nivkh language began with the expeditions of MATSUURA Takeshirô, Leopold von Schrenck, P. von Glehn, N. Seeland und A.N. Lebedev, whose ma­
terials were published between 1856 and 1903. Lev Sternberg and Bronislaw Pilsudski
collected rich materials around the turn of the last century. The linguistic research on
Nivkh has since produced text anthologies, several grammatical sketches, a grammar, a
dictionary, and a considerable number of studies on single domains, including compara­
tive work. Vast materials still await editing and publication in Russian archives.
Attempts at discovering a genetic affiliation to any other language have led to
the postulation of the existence of sound correspondences to the neighboring Tungusic
languages, Manchu, Mongolian, and Ainu; to Uralic, Chukcho-Kamchadal, AlmosanKeresiouan; and even to Southeast Asian languages and Korean (see e.g. Bouda 1960,
Burykin 1989, Krejnovič 1955, Lubsangdorji & Vacek 1992, Mudrak & Nikolaev 1989,
Naert 1962, Panfilov 1974b). Comparative studies are seriously hampered by the lack of
diachronic data and by extensive mutual borrowing of lexical and grammatical material
from neighboring languages. Nivkh has had close contact with the Tungusic languages
(Ulch, Nanai, Evenki, Oroch, Udeghe, Negidal, Orok) and Ainu, as well as with the lan­
guages of the ruling powers (Chinese, Mongolian, Manchu, Russian and Japanese; see
Gruzdeva 1996). The influence of Altaic, Ainu and, of course, Russian, is manifest in
loanwords and phonetic interference. Most Russian technological, political, and cultural
terms are used as foreign words without any adaptation to Nivkh phonology; Russian
morphological and syntactic features have even made their way into the language (cf.
chapters 4.2.1, 4.2.2.2). There are contradictory claims as to the influence of Nivkh on
its surrounding languages. While Burykin considers Nivkh to have been an important
language of interethnic communication, both on Sakhalin and in the Amur region (1996:
993), Gruzdeva points out that it was the Nivkh who were bilingual or multilingual in
interethnic contacts (1996:1008).","[14, 15]"

Krejnovič (1937:34-35) postulates the following construction types with a nominal head:
(87)(Krejnovič 1937:34-35)
noun"" + noun
pronoun + noun
pronoun + noun"" + noun
verb root + noun
noun"" + verb root + noun
pronoun + verb root + noun
pronoun + noun + verb root + nounwith n = from 1 to 4
with n = 1 or 2
with n = 1 or 2Unfortunately, he does not specify the functional aspect, nor does he give examples.
With regard to our template in (8), Krejnovic's 'pronoun' corresponds to both our prefi­
xes and non-singular pronouns, while a 'noun' may express a possessor or an attribute.
This means that the possessor and the attribute slots may contain more than one mor­
pheme each, i.e. be complex themselves, as long as the basic principle applies that (i)
only elements which bear a dependent relation to the nearest head may be integrated into
the noun complex and (ii) there is only one prefix or synthesizing pronoun per complex
(marking its left edge; cf. Jakobson 1971:78). As we already alluded to in chapter 3.8.2,
the elaboration of a nominal complex can be described as the substitution of a nominal
or verbal element in the complex by a complex with the same category as its head.
Thus, with the basic complex types being noun + noun, verb + noun, noun +
verb, and verb + verb, a noun + noun or a verb + noun complex may substitute for the
first N of another noun + noun complex. A noun + verb or verb + verb complex may
substitute for the V of a verb + noun complex. In other words, modifiers or governees of
a head may in turn be preceded by their governee or modifying elements. The products
of these fully productive formations are not lexicalized.
Here are some examples of combinations of a determiner with a nominal or
verbal attribute.",[250]
"The case of coordination nicely supports the general principle of complex formation in
Nivkh: only adjacent constituents in a dependent-head relation synthesize. Coordinated
forms, however, are not in a dependent-head relation to each other. We therefore should
not expect synthesization.
Coordination is different from other cases of non-synthesization as there is still
a noun + verb complex (with the last coordinated undergoer). Syntactic mechanisms and
pragmatic reordering of constituents in the sentence result in the complete dissolution of
the complex, i.e. undergoer and verb are two separate and usually non-adjacent consti­
tuents, as we will see. In this situation, the transitive verb, for which a reflex of its under­
goer is obligatory, takes a 3s undergoer prefix or (if it is single obstruent initial) appears
in its fricative-initial allomorph. A noun which is 'excorporated' from a primary objectverb complex never triggers a bound allomorph or an alternated initial sound of the verb.
Thus, there are then two elements in the sentence referring to one and the same partici­
pant, the undergoer. The important question arising from this situation concerns the ar­
gument and referentiality status of the elements referring to that participant. Remember
that the undergoer prefix is obligatory in the absence of a nominal undergoer synthesi­
zing to the verb, but mutually exclusive with this nominal undergoer in the undergoer
slot of the verbal template. This question will be discussed in chapter 5.
4.4.1
Word order permutation
The usual word order in Nivkh is, as was shown in chapter 1.3.7,
(125)topic - embedded clause _ adverbials ~ subject_ causee _ secondary
object_ primary object-predicateConstituents are permuted for three reasons: they may either be moved into the topic po­
sition, dislocated, or focused. Generally this is possible for central and peripheral partici­
pants as well as adverbials; we are concerned here with the undergoer or primary object.
A topic is understood to be the constituent in the leftmost position of a sentence,
dislocated from the simple clause, and the participant which is established as the predica­
tion base about which the rest of the sentence makes a predication (see Sasse 1987).
Focus is used in the sense of Dik et al. (1981) here.
The following examples show an undergoer in the topic position. The topic is
not case marked, but may bear scalar operators.",[166]

nominal complex being incorporated into a verbal complex (Spencer 1995:480), a con­
struction type which Nivkh also makes use of (as we observed in chapter 8.7). Evidence
for the wordhood of this construction is again constituted by inflectional circumfíxes and
vowel harmony.

non-root bound morphemes, a parallel example to the Chukchi incorporation of modified
nouns is the verbalization of a noun with a. modificational suffix, such as
(30)Greenlandic
(Sadock 1985:395)
illu-ssua-qar-vim-mut
house-big-have-LOCNML-ALL.SG
""to the place with big houses""The elements -ssuaq, -qar- and -vik are derivational morphemes, not roots. The lexical
root for ""house"" is modified by ""big"", the resulting form is verbalized by the non-root
bound morpheme -qar- with possessive meaning, and the whole thing is re-nominalized
by the local nominalizer. This is not noun incorporation, as lexical verbs do not integrate
lexical nouns; only lexical nouns are derived with bound verbalizers (see chapter 5).
9.2.2
Sanskrit
Outside of Siberia, noun-attribute synthesis is attested as well. A well-known case in
point is (non-polysynthetic) Sanskrit. Killingley & Killingley (1995:42-47) give an ac­
count of what they call ""compound phrases"" (known by the traditional name of samāsa).
These are complex noun forms composed ad hoc from a quite unrestricted number of
roots and characterized partly by word properties, partly by phrase properties. The first
sentence below contains an adjective-noun compound form and a noun-noun compound
form; in the second one, the noun-noun compound form has been elaborated upon.

""knowing the essence of all books of behavior""On the one hand, 'compound phrases' are accentual (Whitney 1924:480), non-interruptible units with a fixed order of their parts, permuted as wholes in a clause. Occasionally,260DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHthey contain forms which cannot occur as free forms (Whitney 1924:483). Whitney
stresses that case-marking on the prior element is ""by no means rare"" (1924: 483), and
that gender and plural markers may also occur (cf. 1924:484). Killingley & Killingley
note that exceptionally a focus enclitic is found inside a 'compound phrase' (1995:43).
On the other hand, the constructions are created ad hoc and are not lexicalized
(though some have been; Killingley & Killingley 1995:44). They may reach an impres­
sive complexity, they may contain phoneme clusters otherwise disallowed word-internal­
ly at their internal morpheme boundaries, and they are subject to external sandhi. Fur­
thermore, the Indic grammar tradition does not use the term 'word' for these units, but
applies this term to their components (Killingley & Killingley 1995:42). Incidentally, the
apparently contradictory characteristics of Sanskrit samāsa also apply to German ad hoc
formations (which are considered to be single words by native speakers, though, see
chapter 3.8.3).
Killingley & Killingley report that the Sanskrit construction has evolved from
Vedic to Classical Sanskrit both in frequency and complexity. Whereas in Vedic two or
three lexical morphemes per complex unit are observed, in Classical Sanskrit ""twenty or
more lexemes are not unusual"" (1995:42, see also Whitney 1924:480).
In Sanskrit compound constructions, the last lexical morpheme constitutes the
head and may be a noun (in a nominal complex) or an adjective or participle (in an ad­
jectival complex). The head noun in a noun complex may be combined with a modifying
or case-inflected noun, a proper name or personal pronoun (as in Nivkh), or with an ad­
jective, participle, or numeral (see examples in Whitney 1924).

adjectives are, even if their head is a noun.
As in Nivkh, components of a Sanskrit complex may bear a relation to consti­
tuents outside the complex (Thumb & Hauschild 1959:395, see chapter 3.8.3). Remem­
ber that this fact constitutes one of Panfilov's reasons (see chapter 3.1) for rejecting the
wordhood of Nivkh complexes. For Sanskrit, Whitney lists some examples (1924:515)
which suggest that (i) an attribute, possessor, or complement of a noun which is the prior
member of a compound may follow (precede in the case of the complement) the com­
plex; and (ii) of two coordinated adjectival or nominal modifiers, one may be part of the
complex while the other follows it as a free form. The latter point is reminiscent of
Nivkh; in distinction to Nivkh, however, Sanskrit coordinated nouns (and less often ad­
jectives) may also be constructed as ad hoc word formations, known by the term 'dvandva'.

cally (Whitney 1924:481).
The frequency of nominal complexes in relation to free forms and the conditions of their
use (especially where obligatoriness is concerned) are not more fully described for Sans­
krit. Possessors, deictics, and interrogative elements are not marked on a nominal com­
plex, and in this respect it is less complex than the construction in Chukchi. Sanskrit,
however, is not a poly synthetic language, despite its complex nouns.
9.2.3 Less well-described root concatenating nouns
In the grammars of other polysynthetic languages, which treat complex noun forms
formed from more than one root, only noun-verb, noun-adjective or noun-noun concate­
nation is mentioned, usually under the heading of compounding. Departing from the
Chukchi (and Nivkh) findings, we looked for traces of the following ingredients in a no­
minal complex:
• a deictic element or article
• a possessor marker
• a quantifying expression
• a qualifying modifier, nominal or verbal (adjectival)
• an interrogative element
• a proper name
• grammatical markers on the non-head.","[268, 269, 270, 271, 272]"
"170DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHLanguages with what are traditionally called 'lexical affixes' attach non-root bound mor­
phemes to the verb conveying meanings translated as nouns or adverbials in European
languages, but having no synchronic relation to nouns in the language in question. Salish

denominal verbs are found in Greenlandic (Eskimo; Sadock 1985, Fortescue 1984),
Kwakwala (Wakashan; Boas 1911c), Abkhaz (North-West Caucasian; Hewitt 1989), Ja­

in Nivkh, as well (see chapter 1.3.6), formed e.g. with the verbalizers -varkf ""sth. con­

Gerdts (1996:99), Mardirussian (1975), and Mithun (1984), is differential object mar­
king (cf. Lazard 1984), as in Turkish, Finnish, etc. In these languages, the direct object
is marked in two different ways depending on its animacy, definiteness or referential
status, or on the verb class, tense or aspect of the governing verb. This is the case in Tur­
kish with accusative or without case marking (Dede 1986) and in Finnish with accusa­
tive or partitive case (Chesterman 1991). The non-case-marked (and non-coalescing
though adjacent) direct object in Turkish differs from noun stripping, as it occurs in'NOUN INCORPORATION IN NIVKH ?","[180, 181, 182]"

found in the lexicon with two translations, one the regular 'sum of its parts' meaning, the
other an integral, more specialized meaning, e.g.

eagle-nest-make-LOCNML
a. ""place where the eagle nests""
b. ""eagle's eyrie""This means that such a word is systematically ambiguous between a lexicalized form and
an ad hoc formation. This phenomenon has been described for a polysynthetic language,
Cayuga (Iroquoian), by Sasse (1993). He points out that the lexicalized forms
(71)(Sasse 1993:207)
kaotan hkwih
ehyátohkhwa 'a. ""it habitually carries logs""
a. ""she/one writes with it""b. ""horse""
b. ""pencil""are forms frozen from different inflectional paradigms in their (b) reading which exist
alongside their productively formed non-lexicalized source (a) (1993:207,213). The nor­
mal inflectional form which translates as ""it habitually carries logs"" does not necessarily
refer to horses.
The morphological evidence thus does not suggest any fundamental difference
between complexes and compounds in Nivkh, in particular with respect to wordhood.
3.8.2 The diachronic perspective
In addition to these criteria, there is an interesting diachronic perspective opened up by
Austerlitz. In several papers (1959a, b, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1990a, b, 1994), he
ventures an analysis of synchronic simplex lexical morphemes not as atomic, but as
historically polymorphemic forms. He tries to extract a common root from the phonemic
representations of lexemes belonging to one semantic field on the basis of Nivkh phonotactics, consonant alternations, and extant or assumed derivational morphemes (such as
nominalizing -ř, -ŋ, -q and -ϰ, 1980:79, and -f LOCNML; see also Panfilov 1962:59-62).
To cite some representative and less subtle studies, he observes that the string /ŋa/ ""oc­
curs in over 40 biological, warm-blooded terms"" (1990:28), e.g. ŋa ""animal"", ŋa ţϰ ""foot,
leg"" (ES), ŋaf ""thigh"", ŋasq ""seal's flipper"", ŋaϰ ""milt"", ŋafq ""comrade"", and he lists
several terms having something to do with the sea which begin with /ke/ (1959b:220221), e.g. keřqŋ ""sea"" (< *ke + heŋqŋ ""side""), keϰ ""gull"" (which can be imagined as <
*ke + -ϰ NML), keř (a. shell; which can be imagined as < *ke + -řagent NML), ket (Nivkh
living at the seashore in South Sakhalin). He also compares the /Ik/ in milk ""monster"",
mulk ""birchbark bucket"" and nuγlk ""needle case"" and defines it as a derivational mor­
pheme on the basis of the lexical morphemes mi ""center""/ mi-f ""earth"" (with -f LOCNML),112DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHmu ""boat"" (in view of the shape), and nux ""needle"" (1959b:217-218).
An interesting set of examples of his reconstructions centers around the semantic
field ""arm/hand"". Austerlitz offers the following segmentations (simplified):
(72)
(Austerlitz 1980:81)
SS tamk ""hand""
takñ ""fingernail""
toqñ ""claw""
tomϰ ""elbow""
tot""arm""
torpŋ ""lower arm""
tuñmŋ ""finger""tam-k
ta-k-ñ
to-q-ñ
tom-q
tot
toř-p-ŋ
tu- ñm-ŋ(A) təmk(A) tot ""lower arm""
(A) tuñThe first element (/ta/, /to/, /tu/), which Austerlitz calls the 'starter', refers to the extremi­
ty; the following velar elements /k/ and /q/ he considers to be formants with the meaning
""isosceles shape""; the segment /ñ/ he analyzes as an element meaning ""tapered and poin­
ted""; /t/ as a reduplicated segment; /m/ as a formant meaning ""mobile-joint""; and finally
/k/, /q/, and /ŋ/ as nominal clotures, i.e. nominalizing elements (1980:81-82).
Panfilov (1962:87) adds some more etymologies, e.g. he analyzes məñḑx ""soft
boots"" as composed of məñḑ ""fish skin"" and ki ""footwear"", with the appropriate conso­
nant alternation (*məñḑ-γi), and məx ""bow"" as made up of mu ""boat"" + əx ""end"".
On the basis of this assumed historical segmentability of modern non-transparent
forms, Austerlitz imagines the Nivkh proto-language to be ""something like a class-lan­
guage, with definite slots for specific grammatical and lexical parcels - something like
Nootka"" (1980:83), with Nootka being a polysynthetic Native North American language
(Wakashan), which forms words out of bound morphemes.
As early as 1906, Sternberg, who did extensive field work on Nivkh, pointed out
the greater morphological similarity of Nivkh and Native American languages than of
Nivkh and Ural-Altaic languages. He mentions (1906:138-139)
(i)
the existence of prefixes (which are absent in Ural-Altaic languages),
(ii)
the ""incorporation"" [sic!] of pronouns into nouns and verbs,
(iii)
the existence of nominal classification and numeral classifiers,
(iv)
the derivation of nouns by verbal suffixes,
(v)
the complex verbal inflection,
(vi)
the existence of verbal classifiers, and finally
(vii)
that ""Das direkte Objekt wird in der Form eines reinen Stammes unmit­
telbar vor das Verbum gestellt, mit welchem es eine Einheit bildet, die
der amerikanischen sogenannten Inkorporation sehr nahe steht."" (1906:
139)
[The direct object appears in a bare stem form immediately in front of
the verb, with which it forms an entity reminiscent of incorporation in
American languages].
Unfortunately, Sternberg does not go into detail nor does he cite examples or evidenceDEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD113for his claims. His idea, however, is taken up by Korsakov (1939), who compares the
structure of the 'incorporation' constructions of Chukcho-Kamchadal languages, Nivkh,
and several Native American languages, such as Lakhota, Delaware, Paiute, Nahuatl,
and Yana. He concludes that these languages have different types of complex forms
made up of (i) two noun roots, (ii) an attributive adjective or verb root plus a noun, (iii)
noun incorporation into a verb and (iv) more complex types containing more than two
lexical roots.
The conception of Nivkh words as having been internally complex at an earlier
stage of the language indicates that Nivkh may be similar to the polysynthetic language
system of forming complex words from bound morphemes (see chapters 7 and 10).
3.8.3 The complex in the clause
Turning now to the syntactic behavior of words, Nivkh complexes are permuted in a
clause as wholes, and their rightmost constituent, the head, is inflected for the gramma­
tical categories a simplex lexeme of the same lexical category is. In particular, it is the
only constituent to bear the markers of the obligatory categories of case, mood or converb, which mark the right edge of a complex.
Complexes are also questioned and substituted as wholes. A nominal complex
is questioned with the interrogative pronouns aŋ ""who"", siḑ ""what"", or řaḑ ""which one"",
and can be substituted by the demonstrative pronouns, such as təḑ ""this one"", həḑ ""that
one"", etc. A verbal complex is questioned by jaḑ (~jā- -jaγa-) ""what does s.o./sth. do?""
(for dynamic verbs) or jaʁoḑ ""how is s.o./sth./what is sth. like?"" (for static verbs) and
substituted by haḑ ""s.o./sth. does so"" or toyaḑ, hoγaḑ, etc. ""s.o./sth. is thus"" (see e.g.
Panfilov 1962:255, Otaina 1978:16). The verbal question and substitute forms are verbs
themselves, as their inflectional paradigms show.

University of Cologne, Germany in Summer 2001.
While writing it, I have profited from the support of many people. First of all, I would
like to express my gratitude to Hidetoshi Shiraishi and Svetlana Filimonovna Polet'eva.
Hidetoshi Shiraishi so very kindly conducted field work for me, too, during his own
research trip. From the materials I sent him, he wrote filing cards, did the interviews with
the consultant and recorded and documented the spoken language. Svetlana Polet'eva
kindly read out the materials on the cards. I am very much obliged to both of them for
the pains they took and time they sacrificed on my behalf.
I am very grateful to Hans-Jürgen Sasse and Elisabeth Löbel, my supervisors, for their
valuable comments, and to the other members of my doctoral committee, Franziska
Ehmcke, Ursula Stephany, Fritz Serzisko, and Frank Heidermanns. Hans-Jürgen Sasse
let me work on Nivkh freely within the parameters of the projects on lexical categories
and polysynthesis. It was through Werner Drossard's structural course, however, that I
first came to be interested in Nivkh.
My work profited greatly from discussions with and comments by Daniel Abondolo,
Christoph Benden, Bernard Comrie, William Foley, Ekaterina Jur'evna Gruzdeva, Tôru
Kaneko, Martin Haspelmath, Siri Tuttle and several audiences in Cologne, Leipzig,
Zurich, Tübingen, Leuven, and Berlin, for all of which I am really thankful. A thousand
thanks to Tarek Ahmed, Antje Casaretto, Michael Dunn, Mats Exter, Sevim Genç,
Claudia Leto, Andreas Mühlhäusler, Tomiko Murata and Georg Sachse for sharing their
expertise in Swedish, Sanskrit, Chukchi, Laz, Wichita, Japanese and phonetics with me.
Also, I appreciated so much that Hiroshi Nakagawa shared his materials with me and
introduced me to the Japanese community of Nivkh linguists. Elena Skribnik sent me
papers from Russia that I could not get ahold of here, and Carmen Dawuda showed me
the audio software which was really helpful.
To Pamela Perniss and Aria Jackson I am greatly indebted for correcting my English. I
lived through the whole thing thanks to Karsten Piaszenski's support, both moral and
technical.
Finally, I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Deutsche Forschungsge­
meinschaft (DFG). It funded the project on ""Lexikalische Kategorien und Argumentlinking in polysynthetischen Sprachen"" [Lexical categories and argument linking in po­
lysynthetic languages] as part of the special research program SFB 282 ""Theorie des Le­

tion) slot are determined, cf. Fortescue 1980:260) especially with the causative, passive
and with negation, as in the example below in which different orderings of suffixes yield
different meanings (in type (i), on the other hand, there are no ordering alternatives at

INTRODUCTION1.1
The aim of this study
Determining which morphological type a language exhibits does not seem to pose too
many difficulties, especially as the catalogue of types is a fairly fixed and widely agreed
upon entity in linguistics. Nevertheless, languages may, upon closer examination,
challenge the established order in that they manifest a synthetic organization of a quality
not covered by the traditional types of isolating, agglutinating, fusional, root-inflecting,
and polysynthetic languages.
One such language is Nivkh (also known as Gilyak), which stands out from
other languages because of its highly complex word forms of both verbs and nouns.
They are formed from the fully-productive and ad hoc concatenation of lexical roots
which stand in fixed relationships of dependent and head (in the sense of Nichols 1986)
to each other. These complex word forms represent either the most common or even the
only way of encoding the syntactic relations of undergoer / verb and modifier / noun or
verb, in the absence of any morphology specifying the precise kind of the relation within
a complex form.
There are various morphological synthesis phenomena in linguistics - one or
more of which Nivkh could instantiate - viz. noun incorporation, a construction type
concatenating noun and verb, as has been described by Sapir (1911), Mithun (1984,
1994), Baker (1988,1996), Rosen (1989), de Reuse (1994b), and Gerdts (1996) (to name
only the broadest approaches). Furthermore there are verb root serialization (the
concatenation of more than one verb root in one verbal word form; Bisang 1995), and
polysynthesis (Mithun 1988, Fortescue 1994, Baker 1996, Drossard 1997), which both
lead to complex word forms. Noun incorporation and verb root serialization, however,
focus on single domains of morphosyntax, whereas in Nivkh, one single principle domi­
nates the whole of morphosyntax. Polysynthesis is an organizational principle which en­
compasses a larger area of morphosyntax, but which comprises a range of heterogeneous
phenomena such as polypersonalism, noun incorporation, verb root serialization, deriva­
tion, and affixation.
In contrast to this, a single homogeneous structural principle is active in Nivkh.
This principle consists of a systematic and consistent synthesis of heads and their
dependents under adjacency in the order dependent-head, both for modifier and modified
and for governee and governor, and leads to the complex word forms characteristic of
Nivkh.
To my knowledge, such a structural principle of dependent-head synthesis has
not been described for any language heretofore, although any other languages which
could be adequately described by such a principle are of great typological interest. The
principle will be studied here by analyzing Nivkh construction types in detail, and its2DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHaffinity to noun incorporation, verb root serialization and different types of polysynthesis, for which this study furnishes a systematization, will be discussed.
Since not only verb forms but also noun forms manifest a complex structure in
Nivkh, they will be compared to complex noun structures in a range of (mostly polysynthetic) languages. The classification of complex noun structures observed in the context
of different polysynthetic structures opens up a new perspective on the morphological
organization of languages, in particular an overall uniform formation principle domina­
ting several polysynthetic languages which has so far not been acknowledged in the ap­
proaches to polysynthesis. My study concludes with an assessment of the status of the
principle within morphology.
The study is organized as follows: Chapter 1 furnishes an overview of the Nivkh
people and introduces an outline of Nivkh grammar, including the four basic moldings
of dependent-head synthesis, viz. the noun + verb, noun + noun, verb + noun, and verb
+ verb complexes, with which we will deal throughout this study. Chapter 2 gives a de­
tailed account of Nivkh morphophonemics, which dominate the morphosyntax of the
language and are instrumental in the identification of complexes. This prepares the way
for Chapter 3, which addresses the phonotactic, accentual, morphophonemic, morpholo­
gical, and psychological evidence for the wordhood of the different Nivkh complexes.
Chapter 4 is dedicated to the structure and use of the noun + verb complex; Chapter 5
examines its affinities to noun incorporation. Chapter 6 deals with the verb + verb com­
plex in Nivkh as an example of verb root serialization. Chapter 7 discusses the question
of whether Nivkh exhibits polysynthesis on the basis of the findings of Chapters 4
through 6. Chapter 8 is concerned with the structure and use of the nominal complex
(noun + noun and verb + noun complexes) in Nivkh, and Chapter 9 contains a crosslinguistic study of complex noun forms, helping to assess the Nivkh phenomenon. The
final chapter presents a summary of the morphosyntactic structure of Nivkh, an attempt
at a typology of polysynthesis and an interpretation of the dependent-head synthesis in
Nivkh in light of this typology.
1.2
The Nivkh
The term Ñivx, 'Nivkh' in Russian transcription, is the autonym for the Nivkh people
and their language. Both are also known by the xenonym 'Gilyak'.
The Nivkh live in Far East Asia in the territory of the Russian Federation. They
reside in non-compact settlements of mixed ethnic populations in the Lower Amur basin,
along the estuary north and south of the mouth of the Amur river, and on the north, west
and east coasts of the offshore island of Sakhalin with a small settlement in Poronaisk.
Historically, their habitation also extended into some central parts of Sakhalin (Wurm et
al. 1996: Map 115).
According to the 1989 census, 1,079 of 4,631 ethnic Nivkh, i.e. 23,3%, consi­
dered Nivkh to be their native language (Itogi 1990). For the Khabarovsk kray, which
comprises the Amur region, the number of ethnic Nivkh is given as 2,386, of which 544
declared themselves to be speakers of Nivkh (22,8%; Itogi 1990). On Sakhalin, 447 of
2,008 ethnic Nivkh (22,3%) considered Nivkh their mother tongue (de Graaf 1992:196).","[11, 12, 13]"

trix and an embedded clause is the use of the reflexive pronoun pi (in appropriate cases)
for the subject or any peripheral participant, or of the prefixai p- as the undergoer or
possessor marker for the encoding of the person coreferential to the subject of the matrix
clause in the attributive clause (see also chapters 1.3.7 and 4.3).

Conclusion
As the preceding sections have shown, there is a nominal complex in Nivkh which
parallels the verbal complex. The general principle for the noun complex structure, ana­
logous to the verb complex, is that adjacent elements in a dependent-head relation syn­
thesize; thus the Nivkh noun is head-marked as well. The nominal complex may contain
determiners, possessors, different kinds of attributes (nominal, verbal, quantificational),
and relational morphemes. Again, possessors and attributes may be roots, but may also248DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHbe inflected for all categories except case, focus, mood or converb.
Moreover, the synthesizing non-head elements may be proper names, personal,
demonstrative or interrogative pronouns, or interrogative verbs. Excluded from integra­
tion into the complex are adverbial material and non-last coordinated elements.
It is important to note that synthesization in the nominal complex is absolutely
parallel to synthesization in the verbal complex, subject to the same morphophonological
rules. Therefore, if we accept the existence of a verbal complex, with its similarities to
noun incorporation, we have to accept the existence of a nominal complex as well. This
principle is also stressed by Krejnovic (1934, 1937). With determiners, possessors, and
attributes being integrated into a single nominal complex, the whole complex contains
components which form noun phrases in other languages. We may thus say that the com­
plexes resulting from dependent-head synthesis in Nivkh, both verbal and nominal, cor­
respond to phrases in more analytic languages and are 'word-phrases' in that sense.
If the Nivkh verb complex is thought to be polysynthetic, however, and the
Nivkh noun complex parallels it in complexity and in evidence for wordhood, are we
then dealing with polysynthetic nouns in Nivkh? We will concern ourselves with this
question in the next chapter after studying complex noun word forms in a preliminary
cross-linguistic overview.","[258, 259]"
"As Hall (1999b: 106-107) shows, however, it suffices for a form to be a possible phono­
logical word in German, i.e. to meet the constraints of a minimal phonological free form,
to be uttered on its own. Such a phonological word need not coincide with a word on the
lexical or morphological level.
(84)German
be- und entladen=beladen
und
entladen
load_on
and
unload
""to load and unload sth. (with sth.)""In this example, the preverb be- is a minimal phonological free form, but is definitely not
a lexical or morphological word.
Native speakers of German have a feeling for the ambiguous status of the
remnant. When asked how many words Eröffnungs- und Schlußwort are, informants said
three; the explanation for this assessment was: ""because that is the way you write it"".
The third question, whether *Eröffnungs then constitutes a word, prompted hesitation
and finally denial, the informants' explanation being that ""the word is actually/is
abbreviated from Eröffnungswort"" ""opening address"".
Such a clash between phonological and morphological word status could be at
the heart of Nivkh complex splitting under coordination as well (note that we already
distinguished phonological and morphophonological wordhood in 3.7). Evidence for this
assumption is constituted by the behavior of personal prefixes. As we saw above, perso­
nal prefixes are always the leftmost element in a word form and need a host to attach to.
If, for example, a nominal head is modified by two coordinated attributes and is pos­
sessed, the possessor is marked on the first, non-synthesizing attribute, while the second118DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHattribute is marked on the head noun (Krejnovic 1966:40).

""my good, big boat""There are no constructional alternatives, e.g. *urla ñ-vila-mu is not grammatical, thus the
bracketing function of the prefix still persists. Such a frame construction is paralleled in
German coordinate gapping in ad hoc formations.

and
""short- or long-sleeved brand shirts""Marken-lang-arm-hemd-en
brand-long-sleeve-shirt-PLMarken- ""brand"", which is not a free morphological word in this form and meaning, mo­
difies both Kurzarmhemden and Langarmhemden, and kurzarm- ""short-sleeved"", again
no free form, modifies Hemd ""shirt"" in the same way langarm- ""long-sleeved"" does,
with the two modifiers in a coordinate relationship. Only the element -langarm- is
actually compounded with Hemden, forming a single word with it. Marken- and kurzform a single phonological word together which would be ungrammatical as a morpholo­
gical word. The German example contains one further complication not paralleled in the
Nivkh example above: kurz- ""short"" is also related to Arm ""sleeve"", modifying it in the
same way as lang- ""long"" does.
In this light, Panfilov's claim seems to be too strict when he postulates that any­
thing occurring as a free form must be a separate word (morphologically). In addition,
the splitting up of complex word forms does not seem to be a trait unique to Nivkh; and
although it may not be easy to handle for existing linguistic theories, it is stable and does
not block the synthesization of elements. Thus, the problematic splitting up of comple­
xes under coordination does not prove the non-wordhood of Nivkh complexes. Rather,
their behaviors in relation to morphophonemics, stress, inflection, and in permutation
and substitution tests provide strong evidence for the wordhood of complexes in Nivkh.
One tends not to hesitate to recognize word entities as long as bound morphemes
are involved. Their boundedness - the fact that they need a host to attach to - makes
them part of a longer word. It does not matter then how long a chain of bound mor­
phemes actually is, cf. non-polysynthetic agglutinating or polysynthetic languages. In
the case of morphologically compounded forms, i.e. constructions containing mor­
phemes which may otherwise form free words, one tends to be reluctant to identify them
as single words. Also it seems to be tempting to allow oneself to be inspired by the or­
thography of one's own language in determining the status of a compounded construc­
tion in a foreign language.","[128, 129]"

Nez Perce (Sahaptian) comes next with 23 prefixes and 56 suffixes marked on
nouns (cf. Aoki 1970:56-65) plus case inflection (another 18 suffixes, mostly local con­
cepts, see Aoki 1970:71-79). The prefixes and suffixes express possessive, caritive,
quantificational, instrumental, qualitative, intensifying, and classificatory concepts; rela­
tions such as possessor, inhabitant, friend, etc.; or different nuances of ""place for/of"", as
well as deictic and focus elements.
