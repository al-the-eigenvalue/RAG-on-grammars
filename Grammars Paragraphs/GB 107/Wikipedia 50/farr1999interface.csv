"If the final verb in 6. 1 9 were indicating that the sentence has the illocutionary force of a
statement rather than a content question, its form would be fifiteresa ' you were placing' .
Although the final clause o f an SRC may not contain the focal element questioned, it still
contains the only verb in the SRC marked with the speech-act value for content questions. In
example 6.20, the interrogative pro-word rejo 'what specifically' occurs as the object of the
initial clause that terminates with a medial verb fugeteso 'you threw and' .

'What did you throw that while the dog is eating (it), he is growling?,The nominal+verb combination gangara resi ' is he growling?, is the only verb that is
marked to indicate that example 6.20 is a content question. Even though this particular
clause does not have any constituent being questioned, it carries the speech-act value that
indicates the illocutionary force of the entire sentence. If it were marked as a statement, it
would be gangara resira 'he is growling' .
6.2.3 OPERATION OF NEGATION IN SRCs
Of the co-ranking and chaining sentence constructions in Korafe, SRCs are the only type
that allows several negative bracketing options. Negative bracketing structures may be
manifested: ( 1 ) within one clause in the chain, (2) by a few clauses together, or (3) by the
entire lexical series in the chain, other than the auxiliary verb terminating the sentence.
The two markers of negation, namely the negative focus marker jo ' not' and the negative
deverbal : stem I of verbs and ae 'not doing' usually bracket the segment within which
negation holds. 1 2 Each medial verb in the chain defined by the negation markers i s
interpreted as sharing the irrealis status and negative polarity of the negative deverbal
which terminates the chain.
12In SVcs verbal predicates must lie within the scope ofjo and the negative deverbal; negation of one
verbal constituent does not occur withjo. Bases in co-ranking structures must be individually negated.",[211]
"Apparent anomalies in SRCs225Korafe has two types of purpose constructions differentiated by their polarity: purpose
constructions (positive polarity) and negative purpose constructions (negative polarity).
7.2.2. 1 PURPOSE CONSTRUCTIONS WITH POSITIVE POLARITY
Purpose constructions with positive polarity are grounded temporally and referentially in
the matrix clause.","[244, 245]"
"The scope of negation may cover either a single predication or a sequence of
predications within SRCs. Examples illustrating the scope of negation in SRCs can be found
in §6.2.3. The scope of negation cannot extend beyond a final verb, however. Therefore all
bases in co-ranking sentences must be individually negated. In example 4.92, the verb aira
'he went' terminates the predication in the positive sentence base, and the predication in the
subsequent antithetical base is negated.

' It is true that he went to the house, but he didn't get the knife.'
As illustrated in the previous examples, predications that are statements (4.90) and
questions (4.9 1 ) are negated by jo 'not' at the onset and ae ' not do' at the terminus.
Commands are negated by using the negative hortative form of the final verb. The scope of
negation in a command can be optionally marked by placing {era} 'don't' before the initial
constituent to be negated. Examples 4.93a and b illustrate negative prohibitions without and
with {era } .

The negative deverbal is an essential constituent of all negative predications. The
particle jo 'not' usually precedes the constituent that is the focus of the negation. The
negated segment is terminated by the deverbal, usually in combination with the copula ri
(2.3 1 ), a form of e 'do' (2.32) or a form of iri 'remain' (2.33).",[52]
"1 37,4.6 NEGATION OF PREDICATIONS
Negation of predications in Korafe is usually signalled by the combination of the
negative focus marker jo 'not' and the stem I form of the terminal verb with the negative
de verbal ae 'not doing' at its terminus. The copula ri follows the negative deverbal,
indicating an event that has occurred prior to the speech-act moment, but it does not specify
any time frame (e.g. today's past, near past, etc.).
4.85Na jo
ning-ae=ri.
I S NEG hear.I-not.do=COP.AQ
' I didn't hear (what was said). 'If i t is important to link the non-occurrence of a n event to a specific time frame, the
negative deverbal precedes an appropriately inflected form of the verb e 'do', functioning
like a nominal complement to the verb e 'do ' . Example 4.86 with a today ' s past tense form
and 4.87 with a present tense form are commonly used.
4.86Na jo

"(1)A mismatch occurs between the syntax and semantics o f some lexically fixed verb
sequences, such as 'hit(x,Y)-die(Y)', when they are a negated segment within an SRC.
The scope of negation invariably extends over both verbs in such fixed sequences.
Thus, the jo ' not' precedes a DS future medial form that is syntactically positive and
semantically negative, and the negated segment terminates at the negative deverbal
which is syntactically negative and semantically positive. In example 6.29, the
focused element is the subject nane ' 1 ' , so jo precedes it. The negated segment
terminates with the verb ambae 'not die ' .",[215]

' Before John was born, his mother was very sick. (lit. While John was remaining
not born, before that, his mother encountered very bad poison.)'I do not have a good explanation for why a simultaneous medial form can be juxtaposed
with an anterior conj unctive expression. Certainly the enduring state of affairs conveyed by
jo sirorae iriri 'while he remained not having been born' totally overlaps with the mother' s
period o f illness. Perhaps the temporal conjunction is used because i t is relating the time ofSRCs1 93the mother's illness to John's birth, which is certainly a reality at the speech act encoding
time.
In examples 6.2 1 , 6.22, 6.23 and 6.24 above, the scope of negation does not extend
beyond one clause. Contrasting with them, examples 6.25 and 6.26 contain SRCs in which
several, but not all, bases share a negative polarity. In each case, the negative SRC is linked
at its negative deverbal terminus to a base in another SRC, which does not have negative
polarity. As 6.25 illustrates, the negative SRC terminating with the deverbal form gae 'not
see' is linked to irise 'while remaining' and linked by irise to the other SRC which
terminates with the final verb dadabetira 'it finished' . The latter SRC has realis status, but
the negative SRC, which is underlined, has irrealis status.

(back to a)SRC (a) is broken off at the DS simultaneous medial verb form of se ' speak: siruroro 'while
we will be speaking' . It is resumed at the sequencing form of se: saoro ' we will speak'. SRC
(a) has irrealis status. SRC (b) begins at edo 'and '. It has realis status, as the final verb
babojerera 'they are growing' indicates. The negative SRC (c) intervenes between edo and
etero in S RC (b); it terminates with ningae 'not hear', which is linked to etero in SRC (b).
The medial verb foa 'they will come' is interpreted as sharing the negative polarity and
irrealis status of ningae.
In a number of examples, the entire SRC is negated up until the final auxiliary verb e 'do'
or iri ' remain' or the copula ri, which is the final constituent in the sentence. The negated
verbs in example 6.27 include: mutoro 'we will [not] give' , budo ' (you) will [not] get' , and
yae 'not go' ; the final verb areva 'you will do' terminates the SRC.

of three ways: ( 1 ) mismatches between the syntax and the semantics of some lexically fixed
verb sequences that are negated, (2) the occurrence of the negative deverbal without an
auxiliary or copula in SRCs, and (3) the occurrence of copular constituents of SRCs.","[212, 213, 214, 215]"

"9.2.2 . 1 NEGATION
The scope of negation obligatorily extends over both verbs within all standardised clause
sequences. Therefore, the morphemes that bracket negation, jo . . . ae 'not . . . not do' must
bracket both verbs together. The negative focus markerjo 'not' must occur before either the
initial verb or the focused sector of the initial clause along with the verb, as in 9. 1 Sa.siror-ae =ri.

' Jesus' followers feared lest they (the crowd) would hit him (Paul) and
he would die, so they prohibited (him from speaking to the crowd), and
Paul stood aside (out of harm' s way). ' (Acts 1 9: 30)Although both verbs have third person plural subject referents, they are not coreferential.
The subject of oju edo ' (they) feared' is Iesu da dorevare 'Jesus' followers', but the subject
referent of deoro 'they hit and' is the rioting crowd of people at Ephesus. The negative
purpose construction contains three clauses: the sequencing irrealis SS medial form erama
'will do ' , used here to mark the onset of the scope of the negative hortative, the sequencing
negative hortative DS medial form deoro,9 and the negative hortative final form ambeure
'lest he die ' .
9Some Korafe speakers prefer to use the negative hortative fmal verb forms in all clauses of negative
purpose constructions, medial and terminal. In this example, deoro would have the form deore 'so that
they might not hit' .",[247]
"·say.I-SEQ.R.3S.DS
he said, and . . . '
Both the inserted speech act verb, setiri ' he said and' and the [mal speech act verb setiri 'he
said and' are different-subject medial verb forms, even though the same person delivered
both parts of the quote. Both speech-act verbs predict that some actor other than the Bubu
clan leader performed the action following the speech act.
Direct quotations may additionally have four components that do not occur with indirect
quotations:( 1 ) demonstratives or demonstrative-based pro-verbs in the initial or terminal speech act
formula,
(2) epistemic or modal markers on sentences within the quotation,(3) the completive pause word avori ' all right', the affirmative response word aavori ' al l
right ' , the dubitative pause word avose 'perhaps', o r takaltauka ' no matter what
happens' at quotation onset or after the initial NP, and/or(4) a vocative NP.",[295]
"The medial verb form edo 'do' is used as a coordinating conjunction by Korafe speakers
to link paragraphs and sentences and occasionally clauses and NPs. The speaker uses it to
signal the importance of either the temporal order: 'and then' or the logical order: ' and in
addition to that, on top of that' . In the following example, the speaker uses edo to express
how negative the situation really was.

Both the conjunctions ° 'or' and ai/ai 'or } 1 are used to express alternatives. The
conjunction ° ' or' generally combines phrases, clauses, sentences or paragraphs that
express multiple alternatives, binary and n-ary (where n is any number greater than two).",[279]
"4.7.2 SENTENCE TYPES
4.7.2 . 1 STATEMENTS
Statements or declarative sentences are manifested by clauses that are unmarked by
distinguishing grammatical particles or constructions. Clauses terminating with either the
copula or final independent verb forms in the past tenses (other than third person singular
forms) are marked as definitely asserted by the speech act value marker { - i } . Clauses
terminating with present, future, and third person singular verb forms occur with the neutral
speech-act value marker {-a} . Declarative sentences occur with all the modal particles. The
speech-act value marker is apocopated when sentences terminate with the current relevancy
marker (ere/are/ore) and/or the reported speech evidential (asi).
2021Four relative pitch levels, used to explain intonation contours in English, are helpful in the auditory
analysis of intonation contours in other languages (Pike 1 945 :25-26). These can be labelled extra-high,
high, mid, and low respectively and can be numbered /' 1 for low pitch, 121 for mid-pitch, III for high
pitch, and 141 for extra-high pitch, following Trager ( 1 972: 84).
Pike ( 1 945 :24) discovered that ""there are many more contours than one for question and one for
statement"". Because of his findings, he abandoned a grammatical or lexical definition of intonation
contours in English, preferring to defme them ""in terms of attitudes of the speakers"".",[163]
"CHAPTER 9STANDARDI SED SEQUENCES OF VERBS AND THEMATIC
CLAUSE CHAIN UNITS (TCCUs)This chapter examines standardised ways of expressing particular types of events and
situations. It takes up the question: How are things said in Korafe?
In a much-cited passage, Chomsky ( 1 965 :4) stated that a grammar of a language should
be a systematic description of the linguistic competence of native speakers, competence
being ""the speaker-hearer' s knowledge of the language"". Echoing this view, Radford
( 1 988:3, 27) indicates that ""a model of a native speaker's competence"" is ""a grammar that
tells us what we need to know in order to be fluent in a language"", a grammar being ""a
finite system of rules which generate . . . the infinite set of well-formed sentence-structures in
the language"". In the structuralist grammarian's view, the lexicon is part of the grammar,
lexical items being the form-meaning pairs in a language, morphemes and idioms, that are
unpredictable by the rules of grammar. I
Pawley ( 1 985 :87-90, 1 994 : 7- 1 8, 27) argues that this ' grammar-lexicon model' presents
2
an ""impoverished account of linguistic competence"". He argues that a proper speaker
should show nativelike standards in: producing grammatical utterances, pronouncing words
and adhering to conventional intonation, stress and rhythm patterns, being able to decode
fluent speech, knowing the idiomatic way of saying things as opposed to ways that are
merely grammatical, distinguishing between standardi sed expressions and ad hoc
descriptions, and saying the right thing at the right time.
Drawing on the work of Grace ( 1 987), Pawley proposes an alternative view of languages
as ' subject matter codes (or languages)' . A description of a subject-matter language would2In recent years, the scope of the lexicon generativists propound has been extended from a minimalist list
to include: ( I ) more grammatical information about individual lexemes and (2) forms that were initially
derived by rules of morphonology and syntax, e.g. nominalisations. However, it still differs considerably
from dictionaries that lexicographers make. Pawley ( 1 986: 1 0 1 ) lists a number of morpheme sequences
that dictionaries like Webster 's have but grammarians would count as literal expressions, formed by
productive processes, hence not included in their lexicons.
The term 'grammar-lexicon model' is from Grace ( 1 98 1 ).
In the 1 960s, Pawley sought to do a grammar and lexicon of Kalam, a Papuan language. Feeling
dissatisfied both with his grammatical description and early drafts of the lexicon, he ( 1 993 : 1 03) makes
this comment: ""My thesis . . . failed to record some of the most distinctive and quintessential
characteristics of the language. The analysis did not give the reader much idea of how the Kalam
actually say the kinds of things that they say. The most productive patterns for reporting events and
situations, for instance, were not distinguished from those patterns that were grammatical but
unidiomatic"" .","[308, 309]"
"The negative focus marker jo is missing from the above example; just the negative deverbal
gatae 'not select' occurs. When there is a strong possibility that the non-event can be
reversed, the jo can be omitted. The speaker selected a song and sang it immediately after
the words given in example 6.23 were uttered.
The combination (negative deverbal + iri medial form) provides a strategy for
circumventing the iconic order restriction that SRCs adhere to. It is acceptable to say in
Korafe, while x still remained not having happened, before that . . In example 6.24, a
simultaneous medial form is j uxtaposed with a temporal conj unction that encodes
anteriority.
.",[212]
"6.2 HOW CLAUSES IN SRCS OPERATE TOGETHER
Clauses in SRCs are knit together in the following ways:( 1 ) they occur in a sequence which is isomorphic with the sequence of events they encode;
(2) they can be linked only by those conjunctions which either maintain the temporal
iconicity of the events they represent or encode alternation or addition of events that
totally overlap and hence can be reversed;
(3) the verbs predicating them agree in status (realis or irrealis); 6
(4) they share the propositional value (asserted as valid or desirable or neutral with regard
to assertion) of the terminal clause;
(5) negation can be limited to one clause, or it can extend over several clauses, so any
number of them can share the same polarity; and
(6) those clauses that are predicated by SS medial verbs share the same subj ect referent;
argument sharing also may occur between clauses marked with a DS medial verb and
the following reference clause.
Bonding between medial verbs is also illustrated by instances in which they are gapped.
Bonding between a pair of SRCs at their interface is accomplished by 'tail-head linkage' .
The first five properties as well as gapping and 'tail-head linkage' are explained i n this
section (6.2). Section 6.3 deals with referential tracking.",[201]
"This negative construction could be considered to be an SRC base, which is missing the S S
sequencing form edo. Or it could be treated a s a negative construction with the copula
missing, because it occurs intrasententially. (The copula always indicates assertions;
therefore, it usually occurs sentence-finally.) The sans copula analysis seems quite possible
for example 6.29, because the construction is the initial constituent in the sentence. The
construction could be interpreted to be a co-ranking sentence, rather than an SRC.
However, in example 6.3 1 the negative construction seemingly occurs as a base
constituent in the middle of an SRC.",[215]

Sequencing paradigm :
Simultaneous paradigm:stem I + { -eono}

clause has as its predicate a negative hortative final verb form. Like the negative hortative29Some older speakers utilise this paradigm: -eaono, -easo, -eari, -eaoro, -eaovo. Because of the current
trend to allow only two unique vowels in a sequence, most speakers use the {-eono} set, but Elijah
Simati modified the sequence to 'ea ' rather than 'eo ' in this example: borearo and ambearo.",[81]

Like final verbs, deverbals, both positive and negative, may be the final verb in chaining
structures, as example 5 . 7) above illustrates. (For an explanation of deverbals, refer to §2. 1
and its subsections and §4.6.) In these cases, the negative deverbal l inks the S VC it
terminates to the main clause. In example 5.27, the deverbal joins with the copula rio

Ec- 1 a is a clause embedded in base 1 by a postposition da which signals its possessor
relationship with the noun beM 'reality' . Base 2 is composed of two co-ranking bases,
linked by the conjunction a 'and ' . Bases 2a and 2b are each multiclausal SRCs. Base 1
terminates with a copula, and bases 2a and 2b terminate with final verbs.
Because each base is absolutely grounded, taking the speech act moment as its temporal
and modal reference point, bases in CRSs are not required to share tense, aspect, mood,
polarity, illocutionary force or any arguments. Thus, the copular predicate terminating base
1 in 8 . 1 is realis. but the verbs terminating bases 2a and 2b nested in base 2 have future
irrealis forms. Base 1 has positive polarity in contrast to the latter two bases which each
terminate with a clause having negative polarity.
Bases in CRSs can be linked to each other by direct juxtaposition, as are bases 1 and 2 in
8 . 1 . Or they can be l inked by mostly demonstrative-based forms that function as
conjunctions and determiners, as bases 2a and 2b in 8. 1 are.
Sentence bases can be dependent or independent. Only dependent bases can terminate
with a demonstrative determiner, which follows the final predicate in the base and occurs in
the rhythm group associated with the base. The falling-rising intonation pattern associated
with the terminus of dependent bases distinguishes them prosodically from all other bases
in the CRS.
The syntactic, pragmatic and semantic relationships co-ranking bases have with each
other are the focus of sections ( 1 ) to (3).
(1) Syntactic relationships between co-ranking basesBases constituting C R Ss combine together in interdependent equal and unequal
relationships. The terms 'parataxis' and ' hypotaxis' are used to describe relationships
between bases (Halliday 1 985 : 1 95). 3 Bases that are 'on equal footing' with each other inQuirk, Greenbaum, Leech, and Svartvik ( 1 985:91 8-9 1 9, 944) suggest that ""coordination and subordin­
ation are special cases"" of para/axis and hypo/axis respectively. Coordination is a relationship
between those structures that potentially occur with 'and' ; it is a subset of the equivalence
relationships included in parataxis. Hypo/axis includes subordination of clauses.","[266, 267]"

When these sequences are negated, a discrepancy between their syntax and semantics
occasionally occurs. Syntactically, the negative focus marker jo must precede V I and V2
must be marked by ae. However, in these cases the semantics of the situation indicate that,
while the event represented by V I did not happen, the event represented by V2 did. In (9. 1 8)
the initial clause contains the negative focus marker and its verb is marked irrealis, and the
second predication has the negative deverbal along with the copula.

The initial partial in the suffix sets for final verbs is differentiated for tense, aspect or
mood: -e for present tense, -are for future tense, -rae for customary aspect, -(t)e for today's
past tense, -aete for non-factuallcounterfactual mood, -a for near past tense, -muta for
yesterday' s past, -se for distant past, and -a for enduring past. As noted above, the hortative
is distinguished by the concurrence of -al-aol-o (positive) or -eol-eu (negative) in the initial
slot and an -e in the terminal slot.
The initial partial in the suffix sets for DS medial verbs indicates status. An -e or -te
indicates realis status. The three sets encoding irrealis status are additionally differentiated
as future tense (-aal-ol-a), customary aspect (-eol-ea),and negative hortative mood (eol-eu).","[57, 58]"
"330Chapter 9(4) Even though TCCUs in SRCs are multiclausal, like clauses, they are restricted to having
three unmarked or core arguments. Clauses typically have one to three arguments that are
not obligatorily marked. These are the syntactic core arguments, subject and obj ect, and the
pragmatic topic (P I ) argument. These arguments are realised as overt NPs and/or by the
subject marker on verbs within the chain. TCCUs are also limited to three core arguments
that are not obligatorily marked.
However, TCCUs contrast with clauses in their assignment of arguments. In any given
clause, each core argument may be assigned only one syntactic role. In T C C Us, core
arguments may have object role in one clause and subj ect role in a subsequent clause. For
instance ghaito in unit 3 of 9.72 is an overt NP object of the first clause ghaito ruvedo 'they
coil up the pandanus' , the referent of the ellipsed object of fitoro 'they put (it) ' , and the
referent of the ellipsed subject of irari ' it remains' . Peripheral arguments, such as ijida 'in
the sun' in unit 2 of 9.72, are realised as overt PPs wherever they are needed within the unit.
(5) When the scope of negation extends over more than one TCCU, the negative focus
marker jo 'not' must be repeated. In 9.74 thejo appears in the second unit before nunda
dombuda 'before him' and is repeated in the third unit before the negative deverbal form
sae 'not saying' .

In addition to the properties of SVCS listed above, contiguous SVCs have the following
properties:
( 1 ) They consist minimally of a series of two verbs, but may contain up to four verbs.
(2) It is common for the transitive verbs in contiguous S VC s to share the same obj ect
referent. The referent of oblique arguments may also be shared.
(3) NPs and modifiers obligatorily precede the series of verbs.
(4) The scope of negation obligatorily extends over all verbs in the sequence. The onset of
negation is obligatorily marked by jo 'not' and the terminus by a negated verb form
(negative deverbal marked by ae).
(5) Verbal constituents cannot be linked by conjunctions. (The list of conjunctions can be
found in Table 8. 1 .)
(6) The entire construction is uttered without any perceptible pauses (0. 1 second or longer)
under a single intonational contour.",[175]

"14Chapter 1Vowel iength 20 is phonemic and is written as VV. Heterogeneous vowel sequences occur
as bimoric complex nuclei in syllable rhymes. The oral set includes all possible
combinations but 'uo'. The nasal set is limited, with only the second vowel being nasalised
in several cases: 'iii', ' ill , 'ei' , ""eu' 'ai' '01' , and 'ui' . A few words exhibit lengthened
vowels occurring in heterogeneous vowel sequences as complex V1V2V 2 nuclei in a syllable
(e.g. aii 'yes', kiuun 'sneeze').
Korafe has the following syllable patterns: v, CV, VV, CVV, VVV, CVVV.
Korafe words are stress-timed, with longer words pronounced in approximately the same
time as shorter words. Primary stress within a word is associated with a 'heavy' syllable, a
syllable which is uttered for a longer duration than the other syllables in the word. For
instance, a spectograph of an utterance of beka ['beg.kh a] 'mouth' indicates that [beg] was
uttered for 2.29 seconds and [kh a] for 1.69 seconds. In a similar word biM [big.'kh a]
'sister-in-law' receiving stress on its second syllable, [big] was uttered for 1.36 seconds and
[kh a] for 2.29 seconds. A heavy syllable may also manifest increased amplitude and a
higher pitch.
Stress is predictable for most of the words in Korafe. Non-verbs and verb stems manifest
word stress on: (1) the initial syllable of words with two syllables (2) the second syllable of
words with more than two syllables, or (3) the first (c)vv(v) syllable (when this pattern
occurs). In inflected verb forms, 2 1 stress falls on the initial vowel of vowel-initial suffixes
following either the verb stem or an imperfective morpheme when one occurs in post-stem
position. When an imperfective morpheme is not present and the suffix begins with a
consonant, stress falls on the stem vowel or the classificatory vowel. Where stress is not
predictable, an acute C) accent is written over the most sonorous vowel in the stressed
syllable.
Some basic Korafe intonation contours are illustrated in Chapter 4. More detailed
information on allophonic variation, phonotactics, and other aspects of Korafe phonology is
given in FaIT and FaIT ( 1974: 5-38).
1.6 TYPOLOGY
Korafe is morphologically agglutinating, primarily hosting suffixes and enclitics. It
exhibits both head-marking and dependent-marking strategies:20
21head-markingdependent-markingclausespredicates
auxiliary verbsoblique argumentsnoun phrasesnounsqualifiers
possessorsIn Farr and FaIT ( 1 974:26), this vowel length was interpreted as word tone. And a slight down-glide
often does accompany the lengthened vowel.
There are two other subsidiary rules for the today's past and future tense paradigms that constitute
exceptions to this general rule. These are: ( I ) stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable when a today's
past tense verb form has more than two syllables (e.g. seteni 'I said', tendeni ' I lashed', but beni ' I got'),
and (2) stress perturbs from the initial syllable of the future tense suffix to the second syllable when the
focused element in the clause is not the verb (e.g. Na yarena ' I will go', Na Tufi yarena ' I will go to
Tufi. ).
'Introduction15The unmarked order of core constituents i n the clause is subject-object-verb (sov), but
word order of clausal constituents is fairly free with the one stipulation that the verb be last.
In fact, the verb is the only constituent of the clause that obligatorily occurs. Any argument
that is recoverable from the discourse context or the external deictic situation can be elided.
Korafe distinguishes two major open word classes: nominals and verbs. Nominals
include words that correspond to the categories: noun, qualifier, quantifier, numerator, and
adverb in English. Processes that apply to nominals include inflecting for plurality,
intensity, and/or specific focus, but nominals usually occur without inflections. As is typical
for Papuan languages, verbs are morphologically complex, undergoing agglutinating and
fusional processes which link stems with their corresponding inflections. Verb forms differ
from nominals in the inflectional categories they host, intensification strategies, and the
stress rules that apply to them.
Closed word classes having referential function in discourse are personal pronouns,
interrogatives/indefinites, and demonstratives-deictics. Other closed word classes include:
postpositions, conjunctions, and sentential focus markers. Interjections, response words and
greetings are numerically limited, but the Korafe repertoire is expanding to include English
interjections and responses.
Postpositions often cliticise to the preceding noun phrase or sentence base that they
relate to a larger construction or to the discourse deictic context. They function as: ( 1 )
semantic case role markers, (2) markers of pragmatic functions, and (3) modal indicators.
Markers of semantic case roles and pragmatic functions are enumerated, and their
function(s) with noun phrases are specified in Chapter 3. Some combinations of these
postpositions with nominals, personal pronouns, demonstratives, and interrogatives/
indefinites are lexically frozen (e.g. sovenida ' across from' , eloda ' on top of' , ikxida,
dengesida 'beside', all nominals occurring with the general locative postposition da to
specify a position).
Epistemic and deontic modals terminate sentence bases and left-dislocated themes. The
speaker uses these indicators to declare his or her orientation or attitude towards the deictic
situation detailed. They include: vae 'I'm exasperated', ta ' I ' m annoyed' , lano 'probably
so', tanojo 'perhaps', asi 'certainly (a-si, that-saY.II.evidential indicating reported speech)',
re 'relevant to the immediate deictic situation' and the related demonstrative sets ere, are,
ore which spatially link the event to the speaker, the addressee, or some place away from
both.
Four personal pronoun stems occur in Korafe: na ' 1 ' , ni 'you' , nu 'he, she,it', and ne
'you (pL)/they' . Frozen combinations of these stems with enclitics are used to make dual
and plural as well as first person inclusive and exclusive distinctions. Only pronominal
stems occur with the actor focus suffix -ne and the limiter -suka 'only ' . The nominal
10/0/1010/0 ' self/selves' is used as a reflexive form or to emphasise the subject in a clause
(which is usually a pronoun). Reciprocal relationships are signalled by t% t% .
Interrogative and indefinite words arise from four basic stems. Two are basically
pronominal : ave/mave 'who' and re ' what' . The referential specifier -jo (avejo ' who
specifically?') and semantic case role and pragmatic function markers occur with these two16Chapter 1pronominal forms. The stem ningi 'which' always combines with forms that are based on
,
the demonstrative a 'that' (ningia 'which one?'). The verb stem nange 'how (lit. do what)
is the only Korafe verb that may be followed by the comparative postposition go/gao In
content questions, the question word retains the same position in the clause as its
antecedent except in the case of subject where OSV order often occurs.
All members of the Binandere family manifest the same three-way set of demonstrative
stems: e 'this near the speaker', a 'that near the addressee' , and 0 'that away from both ' .
Markers o f pragmatic functions directly follow demonstratives (amo 'regarding that one',
ava 'that as opposed to any others'). Modal enclitics also occur with the demonstrative set
(amasi 'regarding that certain one'). Semantic case role markers or the pro-verb ge 'do
(FOCUS)' follow one of the pragmatic effector of change markers i or mi (aindae ' on
,
account of that', aminda 'there', aminge 'do thus'). The term 'deictics 22 encompasses the
entire range of demonstrative-based forms.
Korafe contrasts with some Papuan23 languages in having upwards of 20 conjunctions
and conjunction complexes, which are related to demonstrative forms and/or same-subject
medial verb forms. An inventory of these forms and their functions in co-ranking sentences
is catalogued in Chapter 8. Their function in SRCs is outlined in §6.2.4.
Sentential focus particles include the negative focus marker jo ' not' , the proposition
specifier nu 'this proposition selected from the available ones', taka 'just, frustratingly' .
Sentential focus words such as avose 'perhaps (lit. that. CT. say)' and avori 'all right (lit.
,
that.cT.coP) may also occur in isolation as response words. Other than jo which precedes
the negated constituent in focus, these sentential focus markers either occur sentence­
initially or following the subject and are often set off by pauses from the rest of the
sentence. Tag markers for polar questions (e.g. ai 'yes?', ai tefo 'yes or no?' ) also belong to
this class. However, they are set off at the terminus of the sentence by pauses.
Interjections (termed yove in Korafe) are a small set of uninflected words and fixed
expressions that the Korafe employ to express emotional reactions (e.g. mara 'what a
shame' , arie ' wow! '). Among the response words and expressions the Korafe use are:
aavori 'that' s sufficient', aii 'yes' , and aiyakoe or tanik yu 'thank you' . Like the sentential
focus particles, interjections and response words may be set off from an accompanying
sentence by pauses; but more normally they are uttered in isolation associated with an
intonation contour that can display considerable pitch variation. Greetings and farewells
(termed ategi in Korafe) occur in isolation or with a vocative expression. The current daily
greeting Sifo eveva! ' Good day ! (lit. day good)' has largely replaced the traditional
greetings using present tense forms of verbs (e.g. /resa! 'You are staying! ' , Refesa! ' You
are coming! ', Ravasi! 'You have slept! '). Command forms of verbs (e.g. Anumbeyo! 'Sit ! ' ,
/yo! ' Go ! ' , A viyo! ' S leep ! ') continue to b e used a s farewells. Interj ections and other
utterances that are shouted at a distance terminate with an -0.","[33, 34, 35, 36]"

"Clauses. predicates. predications and sentences1 394.7 SIMPLE SENTENCES
Korafe simple sentences are minimally composed of one base with accompanying
prosodies. 1 7 Sentence bases correspond syntactically to the clauses and semantically to the
predications outlined in this chapter, and have either P I SOY or P I :TOPIC-COMMENT
constituent structure.
In simple sentences with P I SOY constituent structure, the verb must be an independent
final verb, and those with P I :TOPIC-COMMENT structure must terminate with the copula
(ri). The maximal constituent structure of Korafe simple sentences can be represented by
one of the following two structures:
Periphery P2:THEME, PI SOY, P3:TA IL or
Periphery P2:THEME, P I :TOPIC COMMENT, P3:TAIL,
where P I and P3 are NPs or PPs, not clauses.
Modal particles that attach to the verb or the copula at the terminus of the base encode
epistemic and evaluative modalities. Epistemic particles include: asi 'that was said (quoted
speech or strongly asserted by the speaker)' , tana 'possibly' , and tanaja 'perhaps, maybe
so, maybe not'. Evaluative particles are: ta 'I, the speaker, am frustrated or annoyed', vae
'I, the speaker, am extremely annoyed to the point of anger' , { ere } 'this material is
immediately relevant to our present situation'. Example 4.94 illustrates the use of the
epistemic modal particle, asi 'that was said'.

sentences in conjunction with avase 'perhaps, I just don't know (lit. that.CT.say.n)"" which
occurs as an initial peripheral segment or follows the thematic entity, as example 4.95

"The overt realisation of class vowels or characteristic vowels in the surface structure of
verb forms is contingent on phonological processes affecting morpheme junctures. These
processes are described below in §(7).
(2) Non-finite verb formsNon-finite verb forms are inflected verbs that are not marked for person. Deverbal forms
and SS medial verb forms are non-finite forms, composed of a verb stem and an invariable
suffix.
Both positive and negative deverbal forms occur with stem I. Positive deverbals take the
suffix -ari: x{stem}-ari 'to x, x-ing'.

signal temporal relationships between marking and referencing clauses. Stem I verb forms
occur only with -do. They indicate non-durative events that are completed before the
reference clause event starts. Stem II forms signal durative events that express rhythmic
iteration (with -do and a form ofJu 'come' or i 'go'), sequencing durative irrealis events
and states (with -a), and overlapping events or states (with -se).

sets, the customary and negative hortative. Both sequencing and simultaneous paradigms of
each of these sets occur with the same suffix sets. But the sequencing paradigm manifests
stem I forms, and the simultaneous paradigm occurs with stem I I forms and the
imperfective marker { - uru } . The sequencing paradigm resembles the hortative mood
paradigm, even exhibiting the fluctuation between {-one } and { -aone} , but occurring with
final {-o} rather than -e. Paradigm examples are:

medial verb, this is the way the facts appear to be. The medial verb govuse ' while they are
planting' , does not fall under the scope of negation. In fact, the clause it terminates appears
to be coordinated in an SRC with the 'clause' the copula ri terminates. The underlined SRC
with negative polarity commences at the negative focus marker jo, and terminates at govae
'not plant' . The entire SRC bracketed by markers of negation is a predicate nominal unit
connected by the negative deverbal to the copula ri which terminates the sentence.
Occasionally negation is expressed by SRCs with verbs having negative hortative forms.
For an account of SRCs utilising negative hortative verb forms, see §2.S.2.6 and §7.2.2.2.
The latter section illustrates the use of negative hortative verb forms in negative purpose
constructions.
6.2.4 CONJOINING IN SRCs
SRCS are ordered tense-iconically, whereas co-ranking structures are ordered logically
and are not necessarily tense-iconic. The sequence of verbs in SRCs is intended to be
isomorphic with the sequence of events in the real world that they encode. Co-rankingSRCs1 97structures relate one proposition to another using rhetorical parameters, e.g. cause-effect
relationships, result-reason relationships, and implicational conditions under which
propositions hold.
In SRCs each clause, other than an initial recapitulated clause, provides new information.
The initial SRC clause, which is the head clause in a tail-head recapitulation, is the only SRC
clause that is given. The coordinating relationship between two SRC clauses is tense-iconic,
hence asymmetrical . B cannot precede A; therefore A+B does not equal B+A . But paratactic
co-ranking constructions, encoding alternation or additive relationships, allow either A+B or
B+A; both are equivalent. And hypotactic co-ranking constructions maintain a number of
relationships between A and B, but A is usually given, generic, or assumed to be given for
the sake of asserting B .
SRC clauses terminated b y medial verbs are normally juxtaposed. Example 6 . 3 3
illustrates juxtaposition o f S S clauses [clauses 4 and 5], DS clauses [clauses 2 and 3 ] , and os
with SS [clauses 3 and 4 ] .

' They went, chopped (the sago tree), it fell, and the two brothers-in-law cut it off
from the base, got a pointed stick, stripped off the bark, and it lay (there).
S ince asymmetrical coordination is maintained by medial verb suffixes, medial
constructions do not require other linking devices. Nevertheless, Korafe S R Cs do
occasionally occur with conjunctions. They either suspend iconic ordering between the
conjoined clauses to allow order reversals A+B=B+A or alternative choices or they make
explicit cause-effect and temporal relationships between the conj oined clauses. The
conjunctive relationship only applies to the two conjoined clauses.
Three conj unctions 0 ' or ' , ii 'and', and kotugo ' and likewise (lit. like a footprint)'
suspend iconic ordering between parallel constructions. Iconic ordering is resumed after the
second clause . The use of the conj unction 0 'or' joins two medial clauses that are
alternatives. In example 6.34, the two SS simultaneous medial verbs: gafuse ' while cutting'
andjetise 'while chopping' are given as equivalent alternatives.

same event, marriage, but evetu fifitero ' while they were marrying women' and vai ero
' while they were marrying men' present the event respectively from male and female

Four temporal connective combinations: ainda gitida 'before that', ainghae dabade 'at
the same time as (lit. with that together)"" ainda jokada 'in the midst of that', and ainda
amboda ' after that', specify precisely the temporal link between clauses in S RCs. These
connective combinations are usually SRC-internal, l inked to the rhythm group of the
previous clause, with a pause following them. Normally SRCs track events in iconic order,
but the combination ainda gitida 'before that' interrupts the sequential temporal flow to
express a sequence of events that is ' out-of-order' . Example 6.23 in the previous section
illustrates how this device operates. So does example 6.37, which is from the the Biblical
account about Noah and the flood. In order for the clause encoding the flood's arrival to
precede the clause indicating Noah's embarking, it must be negated.

Both the temporal connective combinations ainghae dabade ' and immediately (together

simultaneous medial verb forms. In addition to the notion of partial overlap encoded by the
verbs themselves, the connective ainghae dabade indicates that the event encoded by the
clause following it is to be considered as closely synchronised with the event encoded by
the clause that precedes it. In example 6.38, ainghae dabade indicates the cock's crow is
synchronised with the arrival of the snake.

irrealis medial forms accord with final verbs that for the most part express a modal
orientation. However, for convenience, the TAM marker used for indicating realis and
irrealis forms is labelled 'relative tense' marking here.
The relative tense marking that Korafe os medial verbs exhibit is limited to two realis
paradigms and six irrealis paradigms, as Table 6. 1 illustrates.
TABLE 6. 1 : FIRST PERSON FORMS OF OS MEDIAL PARADIGMSSequencing:Realis:
stem 1 + -enol-etenoIrrealis:

Negative Hortative: stem I + -eono
Future: stem II + {-uru} +-ono
Customary: stem II + {-uru} + eono
Negative Hortative: stem II + {-uru} + eonoOf the two realis paradigms, one signals a sequencing relationship between the verb it
marks in the marking clause and the following reference clause, and the other an overlap
relationship.
Like the realis paradigms, the irrealis OS medial paradigms distinguish sequencing and
simultaneous temporal relationships. They are additionally differentiated by three sets of
markers that can be labelled: ( 1 ) general irrealis (or future), (2) customary, and (3) negative
hortative.
Table 6.2 shows the correspondences between O S verb forms in the marking clause
(third column) and final verb forms in the reference clause (fourth column).",[203]
"SRCs1 85or future medial forms, they may occur with the entire set of irrealis final verbs. The DS
medial customary paradigm is restricted in its distribution to occurrence with final verbs
marked for customary aspect or verb complexes that indicate habitual aspect. The DS
negative hortative paradigm occurs only with final verbs marked for negative hortative
mood.
All languages9 in the B inandere family except B aruga have similar tense
correspondences to those listed in Table 6.2 for Korafe. To illustrate the similarity in tense
correspondences that languages in the B inandere family exhibit, Suena tense
correspondences are compared with Korafe sets. Examples illustrating the sequencing of
events having realis status are given in 6.6 (Suena) with 6.7 (Korafe), and examples
illustrating the temporal overlap of events having no realis status in 6.8 (Suena) and 6.9
(Korafe). Irrealis sets are compared in 6.9 (Suena) and 6. 1 0 (Korafe).
In 6.6 the Suena today' s past tense paradigm is used sentence-medially to encode a
sequencing relationship between the marking clause and the reference clause. The reference
clause is predicated by a final verb in each of the following tenses: present (6.6a), today' s
past tense (6.6b), yesterday's past (6.6c) and past (6.6d).

"1 92Chapter 6The negative deverbal is a nominal form that is primarily used in SRCs in combination
with an auxiliary verb, either e 'do' or iri ' remain' . The auxiliary e 'do' is used to encode a
sequencing temporal relationship between marking and reference clauses, and a form of iri
'remain' encodes a simultaneous or overlap temporal relationship between the two clauses.
In example 6.21 with the SS medial form of the auxilary verb edo 'do ' , both the marking

"Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences141Loudness i s indicated by amplitude curves in graphs, which were produced for this study
using the CECIL (Computerised Extraction of Components of Intonation in Language)
program: (Hunt 1 990). Amplitude curves display the average heights of the sound wave
from crest to trough correlated with utterances measured over a small fraction of a second.
(The graphs used in this book are calibrated at one tenth of a second.) Two figures are
given for each sound at the measured point in time, the positive number of decibels (dB)
measured from the centre of the frame up and the negative measured from the centre of the
frame down.
The pattern of pitch changes associated with an utterance or a part of an utterance is
registered by frequency curves (or ' intonation contours'). These contours display the
number of vibrations or hertz (Hz) the sound wave produces in a fraction of a second. Total
intonation contours consist of a precontour and a primary contour that are pronounced
together (Pike 1 945:25-26). The precontour has unstressed syllables, which either rise or
fall in pitch. The primary contour begins with an inherently stressed syllable, termed a
'tonic syllable' by Ladefoged ( 1 975 :99). 1 8 This tonic syllable carries a major pitch change,
either an increase or a decrease in the frequency of the sound wave. A tonic syllable that
occurs with the highest pitch in the intonation contour is called the 'peak ' . Korafe contour
patterns associated with the primary contour, incorporating and continuing the changes that
begin on the tonic syllable, include: falling, falling-slight rise, rising-falling, slight
rise-slight fall-slight rise, and slight fall-slight rise-slight fall. One or more intonation
contours constitute a rhythm unit. A rhythm unit consists of an utterance or part of an
utterance that is bordered by pauses or silence.
Although the amplitude and frequency curves sometimes vary in harmony with each
other in Korafe, more frequently they fluctuate independently. Thus, the speaker can
indicate thematic, topical and focal constituents with increased length, increased loudness, a
significant fluctuation in pitch or any combination of the three. Prosodic amalgamations
differ in their constituents from utterance to utterance and from speaker to speaker. For
instance, Bensted Keghana ( BK) and Kingsley Seko (KS) assigned distinct frequency curves
(or intonation contours) and amplitude curves to the clause in example 4.98. These are
shown on the following page.

yaresa 'you will go' with ya at 29.4 (- 1 0.6dB) and tela 'no' with te at 27.2 (- 1 1 .3dB)). He
assigns the highest pitch to ya in yaresa (2 1 2.2 Hz as compared with ni which registers
1 7 1 .8 Hz at its highest pitch level). The longest syllable is ya in yaresa at 25 1 milliseconds;
the focal element, ai 'yes', is second longest at 242 milliseconds. Thus, the focal
constituent yaresa is the most accented element in the utterance, ranking first in pitch and
in length and a close second in loudness.
Seko assigns the highest pitch to the topical component, ni 'you' (2 1 3 .0 Hz as compared
to ya in yaresa 'you will go' which registers 204.6 Hz). The ya in yaresa has the greatest
amplitude in the utterance (32.9 (-9.7dB) as compared to the te in tela ' no' at 24.8
(- 1 2 . 1 dB)). The longest syllable is ai 'yes', at 284 milliseconds, ni is second at 274
milliseconds, and the ya in yaresa is third at 26 1 milliseconds. In the initial auditory
evaluation of this utterance, the focal constituent yaresa appeared to be the most accented
element to all of us listening to the tape. However, the instrument measurements indicate
that yaresa and ni are pretty much on a par. The focal yaresa ranks first in loudness and is
second in pitch and third in length, while the topical ni has the highest pitch and is second
in length and third in loudness.
Because the focused constituent is the centre of the message the speaker intends to
communicate, it tends to be the most accented element. But, as demonstrated above, the
topic also may be strongly accented. Focal constituents that frequently draw the strongest
accent to them are: ( 1 ) the final lexical verb in a verbal predicate or the stressed word
before the copula in copular predicates, (2) the negative deverbal ae ' not do' in negated
clauses, (3) focus words, such as the focal actor pronouns, the negative specifier ja and theClauses, predicates, predications and sentences1 43proposition specifier nu, and (4) the interrogative pro-word in content questions. The
Korafe can indicate two significant focal constituents by signalling one with increased
amplitude and the other with higher pitch. In the sample taken, the greatest amplitude is
consistently associated with a syllable of a focal constituent. In over 80% of the cases, the
syllable with the highest pitch also belongs to a focal constituent, but only 1 8.3% of the
examples assign both high pitch and loudness to the same syllable. A syllable belonging to
the topical constituent registers the highest pitch in 25% of the examples and the greatest
length in 50% of the examples.
The examples illustrating sentence types in the following sections were recorded by
Kingsley Seko (KS: age 65) and Bensted Keghana ( BK: age 5 1 ) in February 1 995 at Baga
village in the Tufi district of the Oro Province. At that point, an auditory analysis using four
relative pitches20 was made both by the men and this writer. Although accent was originally
perceived as high pitch in the auditory analysis, the instrumental analysis by computer
revealed it was only in a little more than half the sentences that high or very high pitch was
the predominant feature associated with syllables perceived to have the greatest accent. For
the others, increased loudness and, occasionally, length played a more significant role. The
computer-produced graphs of amplitude curves and intonation contours convey a more
accurate and complete picture than the 4-pitch auditory analysis, so they are presented with
the examples in the following sections.
The examples illustrate some trends in the use of intonation contours, loudness, and
length in Korafe sentences. However, the speaker's attitudes at utterance time and motives
in making the utterance also influence the shape of intonation contours, the assignment of
loudness and length, and the positioning of pauses, overlaying and modifying any general
patterns there are. 21 A complete study of the prosodic combinations that are associated with
attitudes such as doubt, relief, joy, grief and anger is beyond the scope of this book.","[161, 162, 163]"
"17The term 'sentence' is not easily defined. Three types differentiated by Lyons ( 1 977:622-635) are:
system-sentences, text-sentences, and utterance-units. System-sentences can be generated from the
formal grammatical rules without reference to any deictic or endophoric context. Text-sentences are
""context-dependent utterance-signals (or parts of utterance-signals)"" (Lyons 1 977:622). Utterance-units
are a subset of utterances which Harris ( 1 95 1 : 1 4) defines as ""any stretch of talk by one person, before
and after which there is silence on the part of that person"". Simple utterance units ""contain one and only
one simple proposition"" and ""are the basic units of language behaviour"" (Lyons 1 977:633).
The term ' simple sentences' used here approximates the abstract grammatical construct termed
' system-sentences', allowing, as Lyons ( I 977:626) suggests, that at least some part of their prosodic
structure, including their intonation contour, be accounted for. Declarative, interrogative and imperative
sentences are system-sentences with a particular grammatical structure. When system-sentences are
contextualised by language speakers, they can be regarded as ""utterance-un its-to which such terms as
' statement', 'question', and 'command' are applicable ( 1 977:633).""",[159]

In some cases, the negative deverbal preceding verb stems in an SVC functions similarly
to a participle. In 5.3 1 , the nominal object and the deverbal, bayau itae 'not having cookedSVCs1 65food' , function as an incorporated unit modifying the ellipsed subj ect referenced on the
verb as second person singular.

"CRSs2678.7 CONJOINED BASES REALISING CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS
Implicational cause-effect relationships are expressed in Korafe by any of several
conjunctions. I S The unmarked order for cause-effect explanations is iconic, namely that
cause precedes effect.
Two conj unctions encode circumstantial or enabling cause-effect: agido ' so (lit. seeing
that) ' and avo gido ' seeing that pivotal cause ' , and two express sufficient cause-effect:
aindae ' because of that' and aindae sedo ' speaking on account of that ' . General
explanation is encoded by ava sedo 'therefore (lit. saying that) ' . These conjunctions signal
hypotactic relationships when they occur in the rhythm group with the initial base and
paratactic relationships when they are separated from base 1 by a pause or a falling glide
that terminates in voicelessness.
Korafe cause-effect and result-reason conj unctions (refer to § 8 . 8) overtly encode a
distinction between private and public information. Public information is referentially
transparent. That is, both speaker and addressee have the same knowledge, beliefs, and
viewpoint on the information and can verify it. Private information is information that only
the speaker has access to. Because it arises from the perspective and beliefs the speaker
holds on the content and context of the speech act, the speaker assumes it is not accessible
to the addressee and uses a form of se ' say' to signal that. The ss medial forms sedo or sise
are used with cause-effect conjunctions (ava sedolsise and aindae sedolsise) and the final
present tense form resira occurs in a result-reason conjunction (ai resira amo
Final cause (purpose) and warning are conveyed by constructions using the positive and
negative hortative paradigms respectively in combination with the complementiser dae ' in
order to' . A fuller account is given in §7.2.2 and its related sub-sections.
Although bases encoding cause normally precede bases encoding effect, dependent
bases that express explanatory cause (sufficient cause, and final cause) also may occur in
sentence-final position. Giv6n ( 1 987 : 1 82- 1 83) suggests that preposed P(presupposed)­
clauses are thematically broad in scope, anaphorically referring to a large chunk of the
preceding discourse as well as serving as a grounding device for the following assertion.
Postposed P-clauses tend to be more concrete, depending on the immediately preceding
clause for their interpretation and ""commonly referring to the motivation of the
participants"" (Giv6n 1 987: 1 82).","[286, 287]"
"When the comparative postposition {go} occurs with predicate complements, its basic
form [go] obligatorily marks them. In verbal clauses, the allomorphic variant [ga] often1 16Chapter 4replaces [go], marking NPs that have pragmatic focus function. Example 4.23 is repeated
from 3 .88b.

' What's the reason for that? (I want to know the specifics involved in this
issue under discussion.)'The distinction between stative non-verbal and stative verbal clauses is often neutralised
when they are negated. The negative deverbal form of iri ' remain, be' obligatorily occurs.
This deverbal is followed by the copula in topic-comment clauses, as example 4.26a
illustrates. Example 4.26b is ungrammatical, because it omits irae.

'do' (4.27c), if a specific temporal span is assigned to the clause.

' While 1 was getting my spear, the pig went (away). (two or more days ago)'The immediate future or hortative paradigm is used to indicate events that directly
follow the speech-act moment and precede the ' normal ' future tense. The related DS
paradigm set of irrealis sequencing forms precedes final verbs in the future tense as well as
imperative, counterfactual, hortative, and positive and negative deverbal forms. As
examples 6. 1 0 and 6. 1 1 show, Suena exhibits an e vs. a distinction (potane ' let me give' vs.
