"10.1 Negation ‒ general characteristics
Negation in Murui involves the morphological process of affixation, where a negative marker
is added to a corresponding positive in main and subordinate clauses. Negation of predicates
is expressed in two different ways: with the standard negative marker -ñe (slot 10 on the verb
structure, see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1) and with the negative attributive -ni ‘lack of attribution
(ability, property, possession)’ (slot 11, cf. the mutually exclusive positive attributive -re for
having ‘attribution (ability, property, possession’). The Murui negative markers with their
corresponding positive equivalents are illustrated in Table 10.1.

Compare the positive and negative constructions in (10.1a-b). The structure of ɨɨ(de) ‘swim’
does not differ from the ‘affirmative’ in (10.1a) with the exception of the addition of the
standard negative marker -ñe in (10.1b):430
(10.1) a. ɨɨ-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-LK-1sg
‘I swim’
b. ɨɨ-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-NEG-LK-1sg
‘I don’t swim’
Examples (10.2a-b) illustrate the positive and the negative constructions with the attributive
markers -re (‘positive attributive’) and -ni (‘negative attributive’) that follow the verbal root
ɨɨ- ‘swim’. Depending on the marker, they mean roughly ‘to have the ability to swim’ and
‘not to have the ability to swim’:
(10.2) a. ɨɨ-re-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-ATT-LK-1sg
‘I can swim (e.g. I am feeling healthy enough to swim)’
b. ɨɨ-ni-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-NEG.ATT-LK-1sg
‘I can’t swim (e.g. because I am sick)’
Depending on the word class they occur with, the attributive markers have different
semantics. They involve ‘ability’, as in (10.2a-b) above, but can also refer to ‘property’ and
‘possession’. The semantics of Murui attributive markers is outlined in Table 10.2.

ADJECTIVES
[+ property]

NOUNS
[+ possession]
[– possession]Generally, the positive attributive -re, as in moko-re-d-e (green-ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) green’,
cannot be negated with either of the negative markers. The positive attributive -re occurs in
the same structural slot as the negative attributive -ni (see §3.1.3). Nowadays, younger
speakers of Murui occasionally negate the positive attributive -re with the standard negative
marker -ñe, yielding constructions such as moko-re-ñe-d-e (green-ATT-NEG-LK-3) ‘(it’s) not431
green’. Older speakers accept only negative constructions with the negative attributive -ni, as
in moko-ni-d-e (green-NEG.ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) not green’. The standard negative and the
attributive markers are used in slightly different environments. While the attributive markers
occur on verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the standard negative -ñe occurs on verbs and nouns
only (with adjectives, the negative attributive is used instead of the standard negative marker
-ñe). The occurrence of Murui attributive and standard negative markers with verbs,
adjectives, and nouns is given in Table 10.3 below.

yesNegation is shown by a single negation marker within a clause (see the privative §10.2.5).
See for instance example (10.3) below. Generally, negating clausal constituents other than
nominalizations is uncommon.

Kata Maria WITH
never come-NEG-LK-3
‘Neither Katarina nor Maria came (lit. Kata with Maria never came).’
A constituent of a negated clause may bear additional stress. Additionally, the topical S/A
and non-S/A subject markers are present on a constituent that is in constrative focus. To
express meanings such as ‘it wasn’t the man we met, it was the spirit’ speakers say ‘we didn’t
meet THE MAN; we met THE SPIRIT’, as in (10.4) below (cf. jɨko=dɨ (dog=S/A.TOP) ‘dog’
in example (6.10) in §6.2.1.1):

(10.5) is an example of the nominalized clausal constituent ‘one who doesn’t talk’. Cases of
double negation within a sentence, such as in (10.5), are not too frequent.

know-NEG-LK-1sgIn Murui, questions differ from declarative and imperative clauses in both their intonation as
well as structure (see §11.2). The structure of some type of questions is unusual in that
predicate markers can be omitted for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural. Negative questions
with omitted predicate markers have different readings than their positive counterparts (see
§10.2.2). Murui has a single negative imperative (prohibitive) form, the standard negative
marker -ñe followed by the marker -no (see §10.2.3). Many of grammatical categories
available in positive clauses are available in the negative as well but there is some minor
degree of paradigmatic asymmetry between positive and negative imperatives. For instance,
the grammatical category of rapid action (used for immediate imperative meanings) cannot be
expressed in negative imperative. The language has two ‘privative’ markers -nino on nouns,
and -nino and -ñeno on verbs and adjectives (on verbs, -ñeno has prohibitive meanings, see
§10.2.3).
Murui lacks an independent grammatical word ‘no’; negative answers are expressed
by jɨɨ ‘yes, no’ followed by negated predicates instead (§10.3.1). 272 Murui has a number of
question words which can function as indefinites, such as ‘nobody/somebody’ and
‘nothing/something’. Their positive and negative readings depend on the predicate’s polarity
(see also jaka in (10.3) that can mean ‘always’ or ‘never’). The language doesn’t seem to
have inherently negative words. A few positive words however, such as mare ‘good,272Jɨɨ ‘agrees’ with predicate’s polarity and, depending on the context, can be translated as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’.","[454, 455, 456, 457]"
"10.4 Summary
Murui negation involves the morphological process of affixation, where negative markers are
added to a corresponding positive in both main and subordinate clauses. Negation of Murui
predicates is expressed in two different ways: by the standard negative marker -ñe and the
negative attributive -ni for ‘lack of attribution (ability, property, possession)’. Murui lacks
independent grammatical words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’ (for which jɨɨ is used). Question words can
function as indefinites. Their positive and negative readings depend on the predicate’s
polarity.",[482]
"10.3.1 Negative answers
Murui lacks independent positive and negative words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’. 281 The language has
three ways to respond to positive and negative questions. They involve:
– the interjection jɨɨ whose meaning ‘yes, no’ depending on the polarity of the verb
used in a question, or
– a full clause.
Often both mechanisms are combined. The interjection jɨɨ can be interpreted as some type of
agreement rather than a full-fledged positive or negative response item. Examples (10.90-91)
illustrate the reading of jɨɨ which ‘agrees’ with the verb’s polarity:
(10.90) a. iraiS bono-dɨ-o?PRED
fire burn.SMLF-LK-2sg
‘Did you set the fire?’
b. jɨɨ!
yes
‘Yes.’280Murui has no word for ‘bad’. Maraiñede ‘no good’ is the nearest approximation of the English ‘bad’, theantonym of ‘good’.
281Murui has also an independent positive response form ɨjɨ ‘uh-huh/yes’ used by hearers and speakers mainlyas a type of an acknowledgment during narration of traditional stories.",[478]
"433
beautiful’, do not have dedicated negative counterparts; the only way to say ‘bad’ is to negate
mare, as in maraiñede ‘bad (lit. not good)’. 27310.2 Clausal negation
Expression of negation in Murui involves morphological processes of verbal affixation of the
standard negative -ñe and the negative attributive -ni used both in main and subordinate
clauses. 274 There is no special negative construction type ‒ a negative clause is structurally
the same as the positive one, with the addition of -ñe or -ni. These markers have the same slot
in the structure of a Murui predicate (see §7.1) and thus never co-occur. While the standard
negative -ñe marks negation of all kinds, the negative attributive denotes either ‘lack of
ability’ (with verbs), ‘lack of property’ (with adjectives), and ‘lack of possession’ (with
nouns). The negative attributive -ni is the ‘dedicated’ counterpart of the positive attributive
marker -re (meaning ‘ability’ with verbs, ‘property’ with adjectives, and ‘possession’ with
nouns) (see Table 10.3 §10.1). In the speech of older speakers of Murui, the positive
attributive marker -re cannot be negated (the negative attributive is used instead). Some
younger speakers do however negate -re with the standard negative marker -ñe.
Negated sentences in Murui are commonly accompanied by a slight headshake.
Unless emotions come into play, there is no significant difference between the intonation
pattern between positive and negative declaratives, and between positive and negative
interrogatives. Generally, in the declarative sentences, the intonation does not rise: roots of273Maraiñede itself is an unusual (possibly archaic) form. Note that mare with the standard negative -ñe has aunique form maraiñede. The form *mareñede is ungrammatical.
274Murui has an independent word ñee used as a pause marker that functions as a ‘filler’ (see Chapter 13 ondiscourse organization).","[457, 458]"

(10.91) a. irai bono-ñe-dɨ-o?PRED

‘Didn’t you set the fire?’
b. jɨɨ!
no
‘No.’
Frequently, when as an answer to a negative question, as in (10.91b), the independent word
jɨɨ is stressed, the predicate has a slightly higher pitch, and it is accompanied by a firm
headshake. A negative answer can also be a full clause. (10.92-93) could be the answers to
either (10.90a) or (10.91a) above.
(10.92) bono-dɨ-kuePRED
burn.SMLF-LK-1sg
‘I set the fire. ‘
(10.93) bono-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
burn.SMLF-NEG-LK-1sg
‘I didn’t set the fire. ‘
The negative answer can also consist of the interjection jɨɨ and a full clause combined, as in
(10.94-95):
(10.94) (jɨɨ!) bono-dɨ-kuePRED
yes burn.SMLF-LK-1sg
‘Yes, I did set the fire. ‘
(10.95) (jɨɨ!) bono-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
no burn.SMLF-NEG-LK-1sg
‘No, I didn’t set the fire. ‘
When one disagrees, they respond with jɨɨ obligatorily followed by a full clause with reversed
polarity. When a question is positive, as in (10.96), a full clause is marked for negation, as in
(10.97); cf. with (10.98). In case of a negative question, as in (10.99), the full clause is
positive, as in (10.100); cf (10.101).

‘No, she didn’t came.’
Example (10.102) is a negative answer to the question uru-e-re-dɨ-o? (child-CLF:G-ATT-LK2sg) ‘Do you have children?’. Additionally, the noun uru-e ‘child’ which is the head of the
intransitive predicate, takes negative attributive marking to express lack of possession.
(10.102) jɨɨ! uru-e-ni-dɨ-kuePRED
no child-CLF:G-PRIV-LK-1sg
‘No! I don’t have children.’
The young speakers of Murui negate the ‘positive possession’ expressed with the positive
attributive -re with the standard negative -ñe, as in (10.103a-b). The elders consider this to be
incorrect. Once a Murui elder Lucio asked Walter whether he had a boat motor. Walter
answered with (10.103a). Lucio corrected him with (10.103b):
(10.103) a.b.","[478, 479, 480]"

The semantics of the standard S-MARK distinguish superiority and inferiority ations:. Murui
also has a similative category which expresses the notion of ‘Y like/as X in terms of object’s
size’ with nouns, as in (1.12).

Murui adjectives, comparative constructions, expression of equality, and similative marker
are focused on in Chapter 9.
Negation of Murui predicates is expressed in two different ways. There are two
negative markers: the standard negative marker -ñe, and the negative attributive -ni for ‘lack
of attribution’. Example (1.13) shows the verb fa(te) ‘hit’ negated with the negative marker
-ñe; in (1.14) the adjective kaɨma- ‘tasty’ is negated with the negative attributive -ni.

The (negative) attributive markers have somewhat different meanings in different
environments. With verbs they denote ‘(lack of) ability’, with adjectives ‘(lack of) property’,
and with nouns ‘(lack of) possession’. Murui lacks independent grammatical words for ‘yes’
and ‘no’. The interjection jɨɨ ‘agrees’ with the verb’s polarity, and, depending on the context,
can be translated as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Negation is discussed in Chapter 10.
Murui distinguishes between content, polar, tag, alternative, and exclamative
questions. All of these have some phonological and morphological properties characteristic to10
them (i.e. different intonation patterns, presence of a tag, and a special kind of morphological
elisions). All interrogative content words are based on two free forms: buu ‘who’ and nɨɨ
‘which, where’. To express meanings like ‘what’, ‘where’, and ‘when’, buu and nɨɨ take
classifiers, e.g. nɨ-rui? (Q2-CLF:DAY) ‘when (lit. which day)?’. Question words can also
function as indefinite words; their positive or negative reading depends on the polarity of the
verb, as in (1.15a-b).

Murui canonical and non-canonical imperatives are usually formally marked, and have
special paralinguistic features such as intonation, frequently accompanied by distinct facial
expressions. Murui has canonical imperatives (that is those which are directed to 2nd person)
and non-canonical imperative forms for 1st person (with hortative meanings). There is no
jussive for 3rd person. Imperatives can be marked with a special aspectual marker -kai which
follows the imperative suffix and indicates urgency and expectation of an immediate
response. Compare the examples below:
(1.16) gui-ño! (eat-IMP) ‘eat!’
(1.17) gui-ño-kai! (eat-IMP-RAPID) ‘eat quickly!’
Additionally, there are a number of imperative strategies, which involve among others future
event nominalizations, e.g. maka-ye (walk-FUT.E.NMLZ) ‘go walking (lit. future action of
walking)’. Murui questions and commands are discussed in Chapter 11.
Murui has an array of clause linking devices in main clauses and dependent clauses.
There are no ‘true’ relative and complement clauses but relativization and complementation11
and strategies. Murui sentence and clause types are focused on in Chapter 12.
Murui discourse is full of various types of repetition, many of which are used for
bridging (head-tail linkage). An example of a bridging construction is given in (1.18)
(bridging clauses are in boldface, reference clauses are underlined).

types (narratives, conversations, and songs), focus and pause markers, and contact-induced
language change is discussed in Chapter 13.
This grammar is based on Murui as spoken in Tercera India, Amazonas, Colombia,
mainly by members of the Ereɨaɨ clan. The data was collected during fieldwork of 12 months
between 2013 and 2016 (see §1.7).","[33, 34, 35, 36]"
"10.3.2 Negative words
The interrogative content words buu ‘who’ and bu-e (Q1-CLF:G) ‘what’ that are used in
content questions (see §3.3.4 and §11.2) can have indefinite readings. If the sentence contains
a negative predicate, their meaning is ‘nobody’ and ‘nothing’; if the predicate’s polarity is
‘positive’, they mean ‘someone’ and ‘something’. Examples are given in (10.104-105). The
reference of buu ‘who’ is reserved only for human referents, bue ‘what’ refers to non-human
referents.

Focused clausal constituents in biclausal constructions are usually topicalized. In such
constructions topic markers occur on constituents of clauses with positive polarity (see
example (6.37) in §6.2.1.2).
There is a tendency for Murui negative clauses to show special syntactic properties.
While in positive declarative sentences non-subject arguments are optionally marked with
topical non-S/A subject -na (see §6.2.1), in their negative counterparts -na is almost
frequently present, as in (10.17-18) below.

pronominal subjects (see Table 7.1 in §7.1). In such cases nouns function as heads of
intransitive clauses, as in (10.19). Intransitive predicates can be negated with the standard
negative -ñe. (10.20) illustrates a negated predicate with the nominal head yofueraɨño

For 3rd person singular, dual, and plural, identity is typically expressed by juxtaposition of
two NP’s, as in (10.21) (see also §12.1.1 on verbless clauses). As Murui verbless clauses437
cannot express verbal categories (such as tense or aspect) or negation, the only way to
express them is by means of negated intransitive predicates with nominal heads. Compare the
‘positive’ verbless clauses with the negated ones in (10.22-23):

10.2.1.2 Negative attribution
Murui negative attributive marker occurs on predicates whose heads are verbs, adjectives,
and nouns. Verbal roots that are marked with the negative attributive -ni have the meaning of
‘not having ability (to perform an action)’. In the following example (10.24), a small girl was
asked to go to the river to play. As she did not want to go, she answered:

The speech of some younger Murui tends to differ from that of Murui elders. To express the
‘lack of ability’ meanings, they negate the positive attributive marker -re with the standard
negative marker -ñe, as in (10.27a). Murui elders occasionally correct such usage by
employing the negative attributive -ni, as in (10.27b). (10.27a-b) is an excerpt from a
dialogue between a father and his son.

‘You won’t be able to eat!’ (the elder corrects his son)The attributive markers -re and -ni occur on all types of adjectives which function as heads of
intransitive predicates. They denote ‘(lack of) property, attribution’. The use of adjectives as
heads of intransitive predicates is de facto the most common way to express attribution in the
language (see §9.1 on verb-like and noun-like functions of adjectives and their ‘temporal’ vs.

‘This fish is tasty (lit. having the property of being tasty).’
Occasionally, ebi-ni-d-e (nice-NEG.ATT-LK-3) ‘not nice, amusing’, as in (10.29), can also be
negated with the standard negative marker -ñe following the positive attributive -re. Uses
such as ebi-re-ñe-d-e (nice-ATT-NEG-LK-3) for ‘not nice, amusing’ are characteristic of the
speech of young Murui, and are considered to be incorrect by Murui elders.
Murui does not have a separate verb meaning ‘have’. As shown in (10.19) identity in
Murui can be expressed by intransitive predicates with nominal heads. This is further
illustrated in (10.31a-b).

The expression of possession in the language is similar to that of identity in that nouns
function as intransitive predicates. Such predicatively functioning nouns are marked with the
positive attributive -re to express ‘possession’ or the negative attributive -ni for ‘lack of
possession’ (see also §5.1.3). Compare the examples below:

10.2.1.3 Subordinate clauses
Murui subordinate clauses are negated in the same way as main clauses – by adding the
standard negative -ñe and the negative attributive -ni markers. All subordinate clauses can be
negated: the complement clause in (10.39-40), the purposive clause in (10.41), the temporal

negative -ñe has scope over the main clause, in (10.47) its scope extends over the

10.2.2 Negation of interrogatives
Murui negative interrogative clauses vary from one another not only in their structures but
also in theirdifferent expectations that speakers have regarding the answer. There are two
types of negative questions in Murui:
– those which have structures of declarative clauses (with interrogative intonation), and
– those which do not; they bear no predicative marking.
All types of negative questions can occur with either the standard negative or the negative
attributive markers. Positive interrogatives differ from the negative ones in their semantics.
While positive interrogatives are questions seeking information (‘Yes or no?’), negative
interrogatives presuppose negative answers. There is no difference between positive and
negative interrogatives in their intonation contour. They all have the rising-falling type of443
intonation which is characteristic to all types of interrogative clauses (see §2.4). Negative
interrogative clauses and their structures are discussed in turn.
A. NEGATIVE DECLARATIVE CLAUSES WITH INTERROGATIVE INTONATION – structurally, such
negative clauses do not differ from the plain negative declarative constructions. When this
type of negative question is used, there is a slight presupposition that the answer will be
negative. Compare the positive question in (10.49) with the negative question in (10.50).

suspected that he went to another village, and that was why she could not find him anywhere.

In some specific context-bound situations, negative questions seem to be understood as ‘yes
or no’ questions. In the following example (10.52), Rata asked Maria to go and do something
together. Maria seemed to be quite sad that day, and Rata wanted to cheer her up:

B. NEGATIVE DECLARATIVE CLAUSES USED FOR 3rd PERSON WITHOUT PREDICATE MARKERS –
structures of predicates referring to 3rd person present a peculiarity – the omission of
predicate markers. They are used exclusively for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural, and are
marked with both the standard negative and the negative attributive markers. Such structures
do not differ in terms of their intonation from other types of questions. They always
presuppose that the answer will be positive. In (10.53), a woman asked her daughter to sweep
inside the house while she went to work. She came back a couple of hours later and upon the
entering the house, upon entering the house she asked her son:

mother why his son did not come back from San Rafael. He expected that his son did not
want to come back home that night.","[460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469]"

Structurally, negative interrogative corresponds to positive interrogative with omitted
predicate markers used for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural (see §11.2). Positive
interrogatives with the omitted predicate markers have the same ‘yes or no?’ readings as
those which bear such markers (see for instance (10.49) above). An example of a positive
interrogative with omitted predicate markers is given in (10.58).

If the answer to the negative question is negative, the independent word jɨɨ is stressed and the
predicate has a slightly higher pitch accompanied by a firm headshake (see §10.3.1).
Negative questions without predicative marking are commonly expressed with verbs as
heads of the predicate, as illustrated throughout examples (10.53-57). The omission of the
predicate markers on negated adjectives and nouns seems to be less common, but does occur.
An example of an adjective is given in (10.59-60) below. In (10.59), the adjective zefui‘bored’ is marked with the negative attributive -ni. (10.60) is expressed by a young Murui
speaker: the positive attributive -re is followed by the standard negative -ñe, cf. examples
(10.27), (10.35), and (10.36).

The occurrence of the standard negative marker on negated interrogative constructions
without predicate markers is unusual, but nevertheless, it does occasionally occur. Example
(10.62) comes from the negated declarative clause ‘it’s not a house’; the head of the negated
predicate is the noun jofo ‘house’, as in jo-fo-ñe-d-e (house-CLF:CAV-NEG-LK-3).

10.2.3 Negative imperatives
Although Murui has a number of imperative constructions (see also §11.1 on canonical and
non-canonical imperatives), the language has a single prohibitive form for the negative
imperatives. Murui prohibitive constructions refer always to the 2nd person, and are marked
on verbs by the standard negative -ñe obligatorily followed by the privative -no. With
adjectives and nouns, such structures have no prohibitive reading (see §11.2.3). The negative447
attributive that occurs in such construction has no prohibitive meanings. Examples of Murui
negative imperatives (prohibitives) are given in (10.65-66):

2pl
sister-CLF:DR.F-NEG.ATT-PRIV eat-NEG.ATT-LK-2pl
‘You cannot eat without your sister! Don’t eat!’gui-ñe-no!PRED
eat-NEG-PRIV.PROHThe prohibitive meaning is restricted to verbs only (such constructions have a special risingfalling intonation, see §11.1). With adjectives and nouns the meaning is strictly privative
‘without’. Verbs used in such construction can also have privative readings if they are not
accompanied by the rising-falling intonation, as in (10.69):
(10.69) maɨjɨ-ñe-no
bi-tɨ-kuePRED
work-NEG-PRIV come-LK-1sg
‘I came without having worked.’
The Murui prohibitive and privative can in fact be considered a special clause type of
privative nominalized clauses. Historically, the Murui prohibitive seems to have originated in448
the reanalysis of such clauses. The prohibitive might have been a command strategy at first.
That is, the privative was used to express prohibitive meanings. Synchronically, the privative
has become a major means of expressing the prohibitive in the language; it also acquired the
imperative-like intonation (sharply rising-falling intonation), which the privative does not
have. The privative has a normal declarative intonation.
Murui negative imperatives express fewer categories than their positive
counterparts. 277 While positive imperatives can take all aspectual markers and make
distinction between ‘delayed’ vs. ‘immediate’ imperative, prohibitives make no such
distinction (Wojtylak, 2016b). For instance, the only way to negate the immediate imperative
maɨnokai! ‘tie quickly!’ in (10.70) is maɨñeno! ‘don’t tie!’ in (10.71):

bi-ya
maɨ-ñe-no!PRED
quick-N.S/A.TOP come
this.CTS-CLF:CRAFT tie-NEG-PRIV.PROH
‘Come quickly! Don’t tie this boat!’
Negative imperatives involving adjectives have to take special markers with meanings of
‘become’ to occur in prohibitive constructions. 278 This is illustrated in (10.72) where a
woman ‘gave an order’ to a pot of soup she just cooked not to get cold:277This is congruent with Aikhenvald (2010). For instance, those Murui verbs that take the ‘terminative’ marker-bi, e.g. ikɨ-d-e ‘tell off (somebody)’ > ikɨ-bi-t-e ‘(s/he) was told off’, cannot be followed by prohibitive marker
(*ikɨ-bi-ñe-no!). The only way to express it is by ikɨ-ñe-no! ‘don’t tell (somebody) off!’. More work has to be
done to establish how the Murui imperative and negative imperative co-occur with such verbal markers.
278There is no difference between positive and negative imperatives with adjectives – all types of adjectiveshave to take the ‘become’ markers to occur in imperative constructions.","[469, 470, 471, 472, 473]"

Murui has a few elements expressing negation other than clausal negation discussed in §10.2.
These are: negative replies (§10.3.1) and negative indefinite words (§10.3.2). Murui does not
seem to have inherently negative lexemes that would have a negative meaning but would not
bear a negative affix or have no positive counterpart. Interestingly, the adjective mare ‘good’
is the only one that is negated but synchronically could be interpreted as a type of lexicalized453
expression: maraiñede (good.ATT.NEG-LK-3) ‘bad (lit. not good)’. 280 Maraiñede is the only
occurrence of the standard negative-ñe which triggers an unusual phonological (and possibly
an archaic) change mare > marai. Note that neither the standard negative -ñe nor the negative
attributive-ni can occur with mare: *mare-ñe-d-e and *mare-ni-d-e are ungrammatical.","[476, 477, 478]"
"42910 Negation
This chapter deals with negation in Murui. General characteristics of negation are discussed
in §10.1. The following section §10.2 deals with clausal negation, including negation of
declaratives (§10.2.1), interrogatives (§10.2.2), and verbless clauses (§10.2.4). Clausal
negation with the privative is discussed is §10.2.4 (see also §6.2.2.5). Section §10.3 focuses
on non-clausal negation (negative answers in §10.3.1, and negative words in §10.3.2). This is
followed by a brief summary in section §10.4.","[453, 454]"

11.2.1 Content questions
Content questions are considered to be questions that seek information and include an
interrogative content word (Dixon, 2012: 400). Generally, interrogative content words
specify a part of the proposition for which specific knowledge is sought (see §3.3.4). In
Murui, an interrogative content word occurs generally in the position of the omitted core
argument and it ‘replaces’ a core-argument in a particular functional slot. This is illustrated in
(11.34) where the interrogative bue ‘what’ appears in the position of an O NP argument. In
(11.35) it occurs in the VCC function.

11.2.2 Polar questions
Polar questions are generally considered to be questions that seek an expression of
confirmation or negation of the questioned proposition (positive and negative polar
questions). Morphology and syntax of Murui polar interrogatives are identical to those of a
declarative clause. The only true distinction between the content and polar questions (beside
the absence of the interrogative content word) is the intonation: polar questions in Murui are
achieved by means of a sharply rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the predicate
(content questions have a high rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the interrogative
content word).
Any declarative clause may become a polar interrogative by using a subtype of a
rising-falling contour (B2) that involves a high rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of
the last word of a clause and is followed by a fall. There is no distinctive intonation
patterning between positive and negative polar questions. (11.38) is an example of the
positive polar question. The sharply rising intonation is over the verb jaai(de) ‘go’:

Polar questions in Murui have a unique feature that other types of questions or any kind of
declarative clauses do not have. There is an optional omission of the verb inflection for the
3rd person, e.g. jaai? (go) ‘Did (he) go?’ and jaai-ñe? (go-NEG) ‘Didn’t (he) go?’ instead of476
the normal jaai-d-e? (go-LK-3) ‘Did (he) go?’ and jaai-ñe-d-e? (go-NEG-LK-3) ‘Didn’t (he)
go?’. All being the same, even in those instances, the intonation does not change.","[498, 499, 500, 501]"

Murui apprehensive can be negated with the standard negative -ñe (e.g. ɨba-ñe-iza!
(buy-NEG-APPR) ‘be careful, they might not buy!’) with the negative attributive -ni (e.g.
maka-ni-za! (walk-NEG.ATT-APPR) ‘be careful, you might not be able to walk!). The
apprehensive rarely co-occurs only with markers of non-spatial setting (see Table 7.4 in §7.4
for restrictions on its co-occurrence). One of the most frequently co-occurring markers with
the apprehensive is the durative marker -ri, as in (7.110):
(7.110) [jɨaɨ-ma

maka-ri-za!PRED
other-CLF:DR.M house-CLF:CAV-LOC walk-DUR-APPR
‘Be careful walking into somebody’s (male’s) house!’7.2.3.2 Ability
Murui has two grammatical markers on verbs expressing ability or its lack: the positive
attributive -re ‘having capability to, being allowed to’ and the negative attributive -ni ‘not
having capability to, not being allowed to’ (slot 11, see also §10.1 on differences in meaning
of the attributive markers with nouns, verbs, and adjectives). 228 Compare the following
examples:

‘I can say this to you (I have time to do so). It is not the hour to go up the river yet.’228The positive attributive marker -re can be negated with the standard negative -ñe in the speech of youngMurui speakers (instead of being negative with the negative atttibutive -ni) (see Chapter 10).","[377, 378]"
"322
which cover speaker’s attitudes towards an event in terms of the desire, apprehension, and
ability to perform an action (attitudinal modalities, §7.2.3.1-2). Deontic modality is expressed
by means of a ‘dedicated’ future event nominalizer with obligative readings (§7.2.3.3) as well
as by imperative mood (§11.1). There are two epistemic modality markers: ‘unconfirmed’
and ‘confirmed certainty’, which cover speaker’s degree of confidence in utterance,
willingness to vouch for information, and the ‘attitude’ of the speaker towards that
information (§7.2.3.4).
Murui has a simple system of evidentiality with two choices available, ‘reported’
(formally marked), and ‘everything else’ (unmarked) (Wojtylak, forthcoming-c). 211 Murui
unmarked verbal forms typically refer to ‘unspecified’ information source. The meaning of
the reported evidential is hearsay acquired through someone else’s speech report. The marker
can be used in declarative and interrogative clauses but not in the imperative ones.
The system of mood indicates types of speech act (statements, commands, and
questions). It applies to complete sentences rather than only the predicate or a clause.
Grammatical categories of mood in Murui are not part of the non-spatial setting
specifications but they correlate to a certain degree. Depending on sentence type, there are
fewer distinctions in expressing certain grammatical categories. For instance, evidentiality is
not expressed in commands, and it rarely occurs in questions. Also, clause types and negation
can affect expression of certain grammatical categories on the verb. An example of this are
verbless clauses which cannot occur with any of the TAME markers (§12.1.1).","[346, 347]"
"11.2.4 Alternative questions
An alternative type of questions is formed by a disjunction of two simple polar questions (of
which, the second is always negated). The final element in the alternative question is always
a negated verb, with rising-falling intonation. This is illustrated in (11.44-46):
(11.44) PedroS
bi-t-ePRED
oo bi-ñe-d-e?PRED
Pedro
come-LK-3 or come-NEG-LK-3
‘Did Pedro come (lit. did Pedro come or didn’t he come)?’
oo roko-ñe?PRED
(11.45) FlorA rokoPRED
Pedro cook
or rook-NEG
‘Did Flor cook (lit. did Flor cook or didn’t she cook)?’
(11.46) (nai-makɨ)S
ɨraɨzi-d-ePRED
oo ɨraɨzi-ñe-d-e?PRED
ANA.SP-CLF:PR.GR.AN celebrate-LK-3 or celebrate-NEG-LK-3
‘Did they celebrate (lit. did they celebrate or they didn’t celebrate)?’
The origin of the discourse linker oo that conjoins the two questions is unclear. It has the
form of the Spanish discourse linker o meaning ‘or’. Nowadays, even the Murui elders never
drop the linker oo in questions that involve the ‘X not X’ opposition. These alternative
questions form a single unit. They can be answered with jɨɨ ‘yes, no’ when the answer is
negative (note the function of jɨɨ is to confirm a positive or a negative value of the478
preposition). When the answer is positive, then a verb is repeated without negative marking.
For instance, to answer positively the alternative question in (11.44), one says bi-t-e! (comeLK-3) ‘He came!’.","[502, 503]"
"451
In verbless clauses expressing possession and benefaction, VCC’s are possessive phrases
which are either left unmarked, as in (10.81), or marked with the genitive -ɨe, as illustrated in
(10.82).

1sg-GENTo negate such verbless clauses the VCC element must function as head of the predicate, as

‘You will not be mine (lit. non-mine you will be).’10.2.5 Clausal negation with the privative case marker
NP’s that function as arguments (nouns and nominalized verbs and adjectives) take the
negative attributive marker -ni, always followed by privative case marker -no. An NP marked
this way has then the privative meaning ‘without’, as illustrated in (10.86-88) (see also
§6.2.2.5 on the privative case marker).","[475, 476]"
"483
12.1.1 Declarative
The most frequent clause type is the declarative (affirmative). This is the ‘default’
(functionally unmarked) clause type in the language. Similary to the interrogative, the
declarative clause is not marked with any separate morpheme. The declarative vs.
interrogative distinction is made using a special intonation contour (see §2.4). The constituent
order of the declarative is usually of the AOV/SV type but it can also be determined by
pragmatic factors (with O being postposed to the clause-final verb) (this is in contrast with
dependent declarative clauses, where the constituent order appears to be rigid, being verbfinal). In natural discourse, clauses with two overtly stated arguments, A and O, are rare (see
§6.1-2). Declarative clauses in Murui are A. INTRANSITIVE CLAUSES, B. EXTENDED
INTRANSITIVE CLAUSES, C. TRANSITIVE CLAUSES, D. EXTENDED TRANSITIVE CLAUSES, and E.","[507, 508]"

First and foremost, I would like to thank the Murui people of the Ereiaɨ clan of the Tercera
India community (Amazonas, Colombia) with whom I lived for over a year between 2013
and 2016, and who forged the deepest of ties with me over the years. My work on Murui
would never have been possible without Lucinda Rodríguez, kue ei, my Murui mother. She
taught me my first Murui words and has been patiently listening to me speaking Murui
komɨnɨ uai since my first fieldwork in Leticia, Colombia, in 2010.

I owe my deepest gratitude to my academic supervisors, Alexandra Aikhenvald and R.M.W.
Dixon, for their patience and constant support as well as their personal guidance that made
the completion of this thesis possible. Alexandra Aikhenvald has given me a vivid interest in
the Amazonian Linguistics. Her outstanding knowledge of the topic of the South American
languages (and beyond) has motivated and guided my work from the very beginning towards
the very end. At the heart of this thesis lies the monumental work of R.M.W. Dixon, Basic
Linguistic Theory. R.M.W. Dixon, a scholar of unparalleled knowledge of the world’s
languages, and a most generous mentor over the years.
I am grateful to all the members of the The Language and Culture Research Centre at James

Chapter they are in (e.g. example ‘(1.5)’ refers to Chapter 1, example 5). Examples have
three lines. The first line is orthographic and breaks up each word into morphemes. The
second line shows morpheme-level glosses. SMALL CAPS are used for grammatical glosses.
Proper names are reproduced throughout the glossing. The final line provides a free
translation into English. The free translations are as idiomatic as possible; parentheses
complement contextual meaning of the free translations. If an example is to be found in the
text in the Appendix, it is marked with ‘TextNumber.SentenceNumber’, as in (T3.3).
In the text, verbs are given in a citation form, where the predicate marker (-dɨ/-tɨ) is
followed by the 3rd person pronominal subject marker -e. For instance, the verb ‘write’ is
presented as kue(te) ‘write’, where kue- is a verbal root. Punctuation depend on the pauses in
speaker’s speech after the sentence is considered to have been completed. Clauses and
sentences are not capitalized. When one word has several different meanings, the most
appropriate one is given in the gloss. ‘Headless’ nominal modifiers that are used as heads of
intransitive predicates are often shown in brackets to indicate non-verbal forms used
intransitively, e.g. [mare-ko]-d-e (good.ATT-CLF.REP.DOG-LK-3) ‘it’s a good (dog)’.
The quotation marks placed around the term Witoto are done at the request of the
Murui, Mɨnɨka, Mɨka, and Nɨpode people. ‘Witoto’ subsumed these four separate groups. The
term Witotoan refers to the language family (that consists of ‘Witoto’, Ocaina, and Nonuya).
Throughout the chapters, there are a few numbering gaps, as some examples were
eliminated in the final stage of the revision process.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

5.1.3Predicative possessive constructionsMurui lacks a verb ‘have’. Stating relationships of possession can be achieved through two
types of predicative possessive constructions:
i) those with attributive markers on predicates whose head is a noun (§5.1.3.1),
ii) the intransitive verb i(te) ‘exist’ where the R is marked with the locative case (§5.1.3.2).
Murui can express possessive meanings through a special kind of verbless clause marked
with the connective ie (discussed in §5.1.3.3)5.1.3.1 Attributive markers on predicates
The most common way to establish a possessive relationship in Murui involves the
morphological process of affixation, where the positive and negative attributive markers -re
and -ni occur on a predicate whose heads can be verbs, adjectives, nouns, as well as closed
word classes that form ‘headless’ nominal modifiers of all kinds. Depending on the word
class they occur with, the attributive markers have different semantics involving ‘ability’ with
verbs, ‘property’ with adjectives and ‘possession’ with nouns (see §10.1). This section
focuses on the attributive markers that express possession: that is, those which occur on
predicates that have nouns and nominal structures as their heads.
Nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers functioning predicatively can be marked
with the positive attributive -re to express ‘possession’, or the negative attributive -ni for its
lack. (5.61-63) are examples of ‘positive’ possession. Occasionally, plural markers can occur
in such constructions. This is in jofuiaɨredɨmɨe ‘(male) who has houses’ in (5.63).

‘She is very poor (lit. having property of being poor). She’s got no house (lit. she

Although the expression of lack of possession is by default marked with the negative
attributive -ni, younger speakers tend to negate the positive attributive -re with the standard
negative marker -ñe. 177 Compare (5.64-65) above with (5.66) below. There is no apparent
change in meaning between predicates marked with the negative attributive -ni, as in (5.6465), and those with the (positive) attributive -re followed by the standard negative -ñe, as in

predicative constructions. In (5.67) the head of the intransitive predicate is the ‘headless’
nominal modifier bue ‘what’ which contains the interrogative buu ‘who’ (see §3.3.4 and
§10.3.2):

Constructions with the standard negative -ñe followed by -no which do not involve such

marked with the negative attributive followed by the privative -ni. The meaning of uzinino
does not have command-like connotations.

Another interrogative content word based off buu is bueñe(ye) ‘why (lit. to do what)’.
Bueñe(ye) is in fact a semi-grammatialized expression, with bue ‘what (thing)’, followed by
the verbal root ñe- ‘do’, and, occasionally, the future nominalizer -ye, has slowely becomes
an interrogative content word in its own right. In (3.107) bueñe forms one phonological word.
Occasionally, in the speech of some elders, it still can form two separate phonological words,

"10.2.1.1 Standard negative
The standard negative marker -ñe occurs on the predicates whose heads are verbs and nouns.
On verbs, -ñe occurs between the verbal root (optionally preceded by TAM and causative
markers), the predicate linker -dɨ or the passive marker and -ga, 275 pronominal subject
markers, and epistemic/evidentiality markers (see §7.1 on the structure of a Murui predicate).
The form of the standard negative -ñe is always the same, regardless of verb’s transitivity,
marking, etc. The following examples (10.6-10) illustrate verbs negated with the standard
negative marker.

"7.1Predicate structureRoot and affixes appear frequently in the order shown in Scheme 7.1 below (see also §3.1.2).
The underived verbal root (slot 1) can be either mono or disyllabic, such as ro(te) ‘sing’,
ja(te) ‘smoke’, ruui(de) ‘roast’, kuei(de) ‘finish’, koro(de) ‘drink broth’, and chicho(de) ‘suck
(bone, finger)’. Reduplicated roots (slot 2) express high degree of intensity of an activity (see
§7.2.2.3), such as maka~maka-dɨ-kue (walk~RED-LK-1sg) ‘I am walking (and walking)’.
Some verbs have lexicalized trisyllabic roots, which contain ‘thematic syllables’ (slot 3).
These thematic syllables appear to be fossilized affixes, now integrated into roots, and cannot
be omitted (see §7.2.2.6). These include eight instances of suffixes which have forms of
classifiers, as in raɨna(de) ‘sit down, put down (on a surface of any kind)’, cf. raaɨ(de) ‘sit
(be in the sitting position)’ and the classifier -na (CLF:TREE). Other verbs obligatorily include
forms that resemble verbal suffixes, such as what might have been the semelfactive -no, as in318

jɨfano(te) ‘play’ (note that the verb jɨfai(de) means ‘get intoxicated’). These thematic suffixes
can occur on all types of lexicalized verbal roots.
The ordering of affixes that follow the verbal root is fixed, but not all the suffixes can
occur on every verb. For instance, intransitive verbs do not receive the passive marking; body
movement affixes do not occur on verbs which do not denote change of bodily position. In a
minimally inflected verb in Murui the positions 1, 15, and 16 are obligatorily filled, as in
(7.1). (7.2) shows a ‘complex’ verbal structure inflected with a variety of affixes; such
‘complex’ structures are not common.

‘I DON’T want to go washing.’Murui aspect is mutually exclusive with some verbal morphology, and occupies more than
one slot within the verb structure (slots 2, 5, and 10). Aspect markers from those slots can cooccur (but there often there is just one choice per slot). Some aspectual distinctions are
restricted to certain tenses. For instance, reduplication, which marks intensity and repetition,
cannot be expressed in future tense; neither does the general habitual -kabi occur with future
tense marking. Other aspectual markers tend to co-occur, such as durative and inceptive
markers; others are restricted and cannot occur with other categories (for instance, remote
habitual is mutually exclusive with the customary marker). Tense (slot 14) is preceded by
negation, indicating that position available for tense is further away from the root than other
verbal categories, such as negation (slot 12). Slot 15 is most commonly filled by either the
linker -dɨ/-tɨ, or the passive -ka/-ga. An example of a passivized verb is given in (7.3).","[342, 343, 344]"

over from the preferred SV/AOV). Verbless clauses make no TAME distinction. They are
negated similarly to verbal predicates: an argument in the VCC function is used as a head of
an intransitive predicate followed by the standard negative -ñe and predicate markers.
Additionally, imperative markers do not occur in verbless clauses. Types of Murui verbless
clauses are discussed in turn.
E1. IDENTITY AND EQUATION ‒ verbless clauses expressing identity and equation are very
frequent in Murui. Examples of verbless clauses expressing identity and equation are given in
(12.13-14). VCC’s of verbless clauses correspond to S arguments of intransitive predicates
expressing identity.

E2. ATTIBUTION ‒ attribution is often expressed through verbless clauses with adjectives
functioning as ‘headless’ nominal modifiers (see §9.1). Examples are given in (12.17-18).
Verbless clauses expressing attribution are negated in the same manner as any other types of
verbless clause. This is illustrated in (12.19).

anaphoric reference to the R, as in (12.21) (see also §5.1 on the expression of possession).

12.1.2 Interrogative
Interrogative clauses have a typical rising-falling intonation (§2.4) as well as special
properties available to them (see the optionality of verbal marking for 3rd person in polar
questions in §11.2.2). Polar questions do not contain interrogative content words unlike
content questions; only one constituent of an interrogative clause can be questioned. Question
words (§3.3.4) can also be have indefinite reading; the value depends on the predicate’s
polarity. There are also a special type of a tag, alternative, and exclamative questions
(§11.2.3-5) which have certain phonological and morphological properties characteristic to
them (i.e. different intonation patterns, presence of a tag, and special kind of morphological
elisions). Gestures, such as raised eyebrows, wide-open eyes, eye contact with the addressee,
occasional lip pointing, generally accompany all kinds of interrogatives.","[511, 512, 513, 514]"
"12.1.3 Imperative
The imperative clauses contains a verb marked with the imperative suffix. The imperative is
used only in independent verbal clauses. Compared to its positive counterpart, Murui negated
imperative shows additional morphological complexity, having a separate prohibitive marker
-no that obligatorily follows the standard negative -ñe. Positive imperatives have two
distinctions ‒ immediate and delayed; see §11.1; negative imperatives have one ‒ the
prohibitive. Imperatives express fewer grammatical meanings than do the corresponding
declaratives and interrogatives (such as the tense distinction). Constituent order in imperative
clauses is the same as that in declarative and interrogative ones (AOV/SV). This is illustrated
with the declarative in (12.24) and the imperative in (12.25):490

give12.2 Independent clauses and clause linking
Murui coordinated clauses express contrast/addition, and disjunction. Murui has also a
connector ie which functions as a textual anaphora and introduces main clauses by making an
anaphoric reference to some information given in the preceding clause (see §13.2.3).
A. CLAUSES OF CONTRAST AND ADDITION ‒ the linker iadɨ is expressed by two main clauses of
which the second is introduced by iadɨ ‘but, although’ and occurs in the clause-initial
position. Iadɨ typically has a contrastive meaning, as in (12.26-28) (see also example T2.27,
T2.37, T2.41, and T2.65). Occasionaly, iadɨ is interchangable with iadedɨ (a form of iadɨ
followed by the topical S/A subject marker =dɨ), as in (12.29).

Iadɨ is not always strictly contrastive. Its semantics appear to also cover such meanings like
‘so, even so’. Example (12.30) shows overlap with cause and result, followed by a purposive
clause (marked with the future event nominalizer -ye).

B. CLAUSES OF DISJUNCTION - disjunction in Murui is encoded with the linker oo ‘or’ in
alternative questions. 296 They are formed by a disjunction of two main clauses that share the
same subject (of which, the second clause is always negated; see also §11.2.4). The same
verb is obligatorily used in both clauses. The linker oo occurs in the clause-initial position
introducing the second clause. For example:
(12.32) PedroS bi-t-ePRED
oo bi-ñe-d-e?PRED
Pedro come-LK-3 or
come-NEG-LK-3
‘Did Pedro come? (lit. did Pedro come or didn’t (he) come?)’296As discussed in §11.2.4, the linker oo does not appear to be a borrowing from Spanish (the Spanish linker ofor ‘or’).","[514, 515, 516]"
"320As put by Echeverri (1997: 64): “The boarding schools of La Chorrera and La Pedrera are the two oldest ofthe Amazonas Department (founded in 1933 and 1934, respectively)”. According to Echeverri (1997: 87):
“Catalan-Spanish Capuchin Fathers have arrived to Colombia since the 1890s. The Colombian government put
them in charge of the christianization of the “savage” Indians, according to a Concordat the Colombian
Government signed with the Holy See in 1887. The Capuchins established their base of operations in the
Sibundoy valley, upper Putumayo. In the 1930s they extended their area of operations toward the CaquetáPutumayo and have stayed there ever since. Capuchin Father Estanislao de Les Corts founded the “Orphanage”
(later boarding school) of La Chorrera in 1933, soon after the end of the Colombo-Peruvian border conflict.”
Echeverri (1997: 63) further adds: “Two other boarding schools were established in San Rafael (Caraparaná
river) in the 1960s, and in Araracuara (Caquetá river) in the 1970s. Most of the Indians have received basic
education in these boarding schools. In the aftermath of the rubber boom the Indians gradually became
“Colombians” and “Christians”.’546
13.5.1 Language contact and change - grammar
Comparison of the speech of the Murui elders and younger speakers of Murui shows apparent
language change, on phonological, morphological, and lexical levels. An example of the
phonological change is the introduction of the Spanish voiceless dental fricative [θ] that is
pronounced by young Murui as the voiceless apico-alveolar [s], as in raize [raise] instead of
[raiθe] (see §2.1.1). Spanish loan nouns (which have penultimate stress) are adapted to the
Murui word-initial stress pattern in the speech of older speakers, but retain their Spanish
stress pattern in the speech of younger speakers. The speech of elders is also characterized by
adoption of the Murui CV syllable pattern for Spanish loanwords. For instance, the name
Ismael is often pronounced by elders as Imae [i.ma.e] (see also §2.6 on loan adaptation).
Such phonological adaptation is absent in the speech of the younger speakers of Murui.
The influence of Spanish on Murui morphology is less apparent than that on the on
phonology, or the lexical ‘inventory’ of the language. Nevertheless, one can say that the
speech of young speakers is in a stage of change. An example of this is the negation of the
positive attributive marker -re which in the speech of innovative Murui speakers can be
negated with the standard negative -ñe; in the speech of the elders such negation is
ungrammatical (see §5.1.3.1). Another example is the use of the differential object marker na, which in the speech of young people is somewhat more ‘loosely’ used (see §6.2). The use
of Murui ‘dedicated’ comparative constructions (§9.2) is yet another example. Monoclausal
comparative constructions types (that are somewhat similar to those in Spanish) are used
more frequently by younger speakers; older speakers tend to use biclausal constructions. The
speech of young speakers is full of Spanish discourse markers and linkers such as pero
(Spanish for ‘but’) and y (Spanish for ‘and’). The speech of Mesia Magallanes Ordoñez (Text
5 in the Appendix) is a case in point.","[570, 571]"
"477
Negative questions rarely occur with the tag words. When this happens however, there is no
change in their intonation patterns. The following example illustrates that the tag erua has the
same sharply rising intonation as the tag would have in any positive question:

‘You did not go by Pedro’s canoe, didn’t you?’
The tag forms erua and ua can also stand on their own. It is common to use both forms to
sustain conversations and let the speaker continue (see examples T2.15, T2.31, and T2.45,
T2.51, T2.70 in the Appendix and §13.3.2 on the use of ua in discourse).","[501, 502]"
"11.2.5 Exclamative questions and sentences
Interrogative forms with nɨɨ and buu followed by the focus marker -ka are commonly used in
exclamations. An example is given in (11.47) (see also example T2.27 in the Appendix). See
(3.99) in §3.3.4 for an example of an exclamative sentence containing buu-ka (Q1-FOC).

Another frequent way of answering one’s question is the ‘confirmative’ interjection jɨɨ that is
used when a speaker ‘agrees’ with the value of the preposition. Simply saying, depending on
the polarity of the verb in the question, jɨɨ will be interpreted as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. The
element in focus, or even a whole clause, may or may not be repeated. Examples are given in

Such noun-like underived adjectives can also be used as ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, e.g.
jedakɨ-roi (thick-CLF:CLOTHES) ‘thick (clothes)’. When the adjective jakaɨ- ‘old’ functions as
a nominal modifier, its form is reduced to jaka-, as in jaka-ko (old-CLF.REP:DOG) ‘old
(dog)’. 254
A3. NOUN-LIKE LEXICALIZED ADJECTIVES – Synchronically, there are two adjectives which
obligatorily contain the positive attributive marker -re, but have many of morphosyntactic
properties of underived adjectives (i.e. they can neither head intransitive predicates nor can
they occur with the negative attributive -ni) but not all (i.e. they do not occur with the generic
classifier -e). Two adjectives belong to this class:
VALUE:
PHYSICAL PROPERTY:mare ‘good’
aare ‘long, far’The adjective mare ‘good’ is unusual in that under negation, it undergoes a unique
phonological change ‒ rather than *mare-ñe-d-e, the negated form of mare is maraiñe-d-e
(good.ATT.NEG-LK-3) (see §10.3).
Similarly to underived adjectives A1 and A2, noun-like adjectives A3 function as
modifiers within an NP but take no generic classifier -e. An example of mare that functions
as a modifier within an NP is given in (9.4). Alternatively, mare jiza ‘good daughter’ could
be referred to with the ‘headless’ nominal modifier mare-za (good.ATT-CLF:IMMAT) ‘good
(young person)’. A similar example is given in (9.5).","[427, 428]"
"321
The verbal category of tense in Murui is manifested as a binary opposition between
non-future and future. 210 The non-future tense is the unmarked ‘default’ verb form which is
found in a main clause of the declarative, interrogative, and imperative mood, regardless of
its polarity. When expressing the time specification present vs. past, Murui relies on lexical
time words, such as jai ‘already’ or jaa ‘soon’ (§7.2.1.3). The future tense, marked by the
suffix -i(t)ɨ and/or vowel lengthening of verbal roots, is found in the declarative and
interrogative mood and does not extend to the imperative mood (note, however, that Murui
has a grammatical category of ‘immediate imperative’ expressed by the rapid action -kai, see
§11.1.1). Tense in main clauses is absolute and always involves time specification (either the
‘unmarked’ non-future or the future tense markers). There is no grammatical marking of
relative tense in subordinate clauses. Some subordinate clauses involving event
nominalizations have time specification (non-future vs. future, such as the future event
nominalizer -ye, which can also have ‘obligative’ meanings, see §7.2.3.3). Others, such as
relative clauses, lack time specification and their interpretations are dependent on the
meaning of the verb of the main clause.
Aspect markers are quite extensive in Murui. The aspectual system covers the
following categories: phase of activity (whether an activity is finishing), temporal extent
(whether the activity extends over a period of time), degree (whether an action has high
intensity), frequency (indicating whether something is repetitive, done once, or a little bit,
whether it is (remotely) habitual, or customary), and manner (relating to the manner in which
an action is performed, such as by means of scratching with small pointed objects).
With respect to the system of modality, the language has an array of verbal suffixes210The opposition non-future vs. future is not common cross-linguistically (Dixon 2012:14).","[345, 346]"

B. BENEFACTIVE ‘FOR, FOR BENEFIT OF’ WITH PRONOUNS – in their benefactive meaning, -ri
implies that the referent of the noun receives the benefit of the situation expressed by the
clause. The causal and benefactive meanings are related - benefactive readings do also
involve causal relationship. This is illustrated in (6.158). Such examples are rare in Murui,
however - while some speakers do use -ri with pronouns, others do not. Murui speakers
assign such usage to the Mɨnɨka variety, and frequently give benefactive reading in clauses
that contain with fakai ‘time’, as in (6.159).

While the use of -ri with 1st person singular is debatable among speakers, -ri with 1st person
plural, as in (6.160), is widely recognized. 208 What is interesting about (6.160) is that the
clause might have two different interpretations, each depending on a situation. If a speaker
utters it when the referent is present (e.g. during a gathering), it has positive connotations and
is understood as ‘(He) speaks for (the benefit of) us.’. If the referent is not present, the
meaning is negative, as in (6.160):

Murui nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers can take the case marker -(ni)no meaning
‘without’. The marker -(ni)no is in fact a combination of the negative attributive -ni followed
by the privative -no. Such privative clauses always share the same subject. Examples are
given in (6.161-163):

The marker can also occur on verbs and adjectives in the form of -(ni)no or -(ñe)no (cf. the
form of the standard negator is -ñe). 209 The privative -no has to co-occur with either the
negative attributive -ni, as in examples (6.161-163) above, or the standard negator -ñe, as in

predicate: SV and AOV. Murui shows a nominative-accusative pattern of constituent
ordering – S, A followed by O, occur before the verb. The placement of the non-core
arguments follows the nominative–accusative nature of Murui: SXV and AOXV. Oblique
arguments are obligatorily marked with cases (see §6.2.2.1 on the occasional omission of the
locative). (6.165) illustrates an intransitive clause with the oblique argument San Rafaelmo
‘to San Rafael’ following the S argument. (6.166) is an example of a transitive clause with
the O following the A.

(6.164) (see §10.2.3).","[334, 335, 336, 337]"
"463
There is no dedicated negative counterpart of the canonical imperative. There is a single
prohibitive form for all negative imperatives, which are expressed on the verb by the standard
negative -ñe followed by the privative marker -no; such constructions have prohibitive
readings (see also §10.2.3 on negative imperatives). Negative imperatives show no delayed‒
immediate imperative distinction. An example of a negative imperative is given in (11.13):(11.13) uai-ñe-noPRED
oo-ɨe-ñe-d-e=zaPRED
get.ANDTV-NEG-PRIV.PROH 2sg-GEN-NEG-LK-3=UNCERT
‘Don’t take (lit. get it) away! It’s not yours.’
Canonical imperatives display variation in their ‘strength’. The imperatives which are
expressed by verbal roots, followed by the imperative -no, and aspectual markers, are
considered to be the ‘weakest’ in their strength. Those which occur with imperative,
directional, and rapid action markers are understood as more coercive. A brief overview the
strength of Murui cannonical imperatives is given in Table 11.2.

11.1.2 Murui non-canonical imperatives
Murui has hortative imperative forms for 1st person but it lacks jussive (those for 3rd person).
Murui hortatives lack abrupt meaning, and have connotations of invitation, encouragement,
and suggestion. Hortative (dual and plural) is always inclusive, never exclusive in Murui.
This has to do with the cultural prohibition against individualization. Usually, the Murui
people see themselves in terms of ‘we’ kaɨ (1pl), never ‘me’ kue (1sg). The traditional Murui
speakers always talk in pluralistic terms recognizing the contributions of the people i.e. kaɨ
(1pl), and never promoting the individual i.e. kue (1sg) (see also §5.1.4). There are two ways
of expressing the hortative meaning in Murui; they belong to different verbal paradigms. The
two hortative constructions are discussed in turn.
I. HORTATIVE ‘let’s’ ‒ the meaning of the hortative ‘let’s’ is that of suggestion and invitation.
It generally occurs with overtly expressed 1st person dual and plural pronouns. The hortative
‘let’s’ construction consists of either a verbal root or a verbal root followed by the dedicated
imperative -no, and, as such it belongs to the same paradigm as the canonical imperative (cf.
§11.1.1). An example is given in (11.14). Usually, the hortative of this kind co-occurs with
the manner adverb mai ‘let’, as in (11.15).
(11.14) beno-moLOC

HERE.CLF:SP.PLACE

mai
kokoS jenuai-ri!PRED
honey wife’s.husband.VOC LET
1du.m search.for.ANDTV-DUR
‘A bee hive! Brother-in-law! We go away to search for (a bee hive)!’
Sporadically, the hortative can be used for the 1st person singular. In (11.16) the elder Lucio
was talking to himself, considering whether he should attend a dance ritual he has been
invited to the other day:465
(11.16) yo-ga-kue-zaPRED
mai kueS feeiñuai!PRED
tell-PASS-1sg-EMPH LET 1sg receive.ANDTV
‘As I have been invited (lit. told), let me accept (the invitation).’
There appears to be no limitation as to the co-occurrence of the hortative ‘let’s’ with verbal
markers, including aspectual and spatial markers, as well as the rapid action -kai and the
causative. with When they co-occur on the verbal root, they make the hortative meaning
stronger (this is similar to the variation in the strength of canonical imperatives, see Table
11.2). In (11.17) the imperative fɨnuaɨ ‘go make’ with the andative marker is therefore
considered to be a ‘stronger’ suggestion.

(11.17) noka-e-naO
canoe-CLF:G-N.S/A.TOP need-LK-3pl
LET 1pl make.ANDTV
‘They need a canoe, let’s go make it!’
If the hortative meaning is clear from the immediate context, verbs can sometimes be omitted
from the hortative ‘let’s’ construction. When this is the case, mai is obligatorily stated so the
the hortative meaning is retained. In example (11.18) a group of people were preparing to go
to their jungle garden. When it was time to go, a man said:
aa
i-t-e…PRED
(11.18) jai
jito-maS
already sun-CLF:DR.M above exist-LK-3
‘It’s late already… Let’s (go).’mai kaɨ!S
LET 1plII. HORTATIVE ‘strong let’s’ ‒ the meaning of the hortative ‘strong let’s’ construction is that
of strong suggestion, encouragement, invitation, and almost persuasion. It has overtones of
action to be done soon. The hortative ‘strong let’s’ is formed with the suffix -yɨ that follows
directly a verbal root. As it cannot co-occur with the imperative -no and the marker of rapid
action -kai, the suffix -yɨ belongs to a different paradigm than other imperative forms. The
differences between the hortative ‘strong let’s’ and other types of Murui imperative
constructions are given in Table 11.3.","[487, 488, 489, 490]"

A few affixes have the same meaning with both verbs and adjectives. This is the case for the
manner suffix -rui illustrated in (9.18) (cf. the manner -rui with verbal roots, Scheme 7.1 in
§7.1 and the manner -rui with adjectival roots, Scheme 3.3 in §3.1.3).

B2. FORMATION OF ADVERBS – most of the adverbs have adjectival origin. Such adverbs
consist just of an adjectival root and the positive attributive -re, and obligatorily occur in the
pre-verbal position, as in (9.19). Such formations are not possible for the majority of Murui
verbs.

i-t-ePRED
1sg pet
small-ATT exist-LK-3
‘I have a few pets (lit. there is little of my pets).’410
B3. INABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THE MAJORITY OF VERBAL CONSTRUCTIONS – an important
distinction between verbs and adjectives in Murui is the occurrence of verbs in imperative,
passive, and causative constructions. This also includes the standard negative marker -ñe and
clause linking markers that are not available for adjectives. Verbs can be negated by both the
standard negative marker -ñe and by the negative attributive -ni (for ‘lack of ability’). Verblike adjectives can only be negated by suffixing the negative attributive marker -ni to the root.
That is, bora-re-d-e (yellow-ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) yellow’ becomes bora-ni-d-e (yellow-NEG.ATTLK-3) ‘(it’s not) yellow’ (but see §10.2.1.2 for differences between younger and older Muruispeakers). Adjectives are do not occur with the majority of clause linking markers such as the
future event nominalizer -ye (followed by the topical non-S/A subject marker -na) that
normally occur on verbs in purposive clauses (see §12.3.1).
B4. THE STRUCTURE OF ‘HEADLESS’ NOMINAL MODIFIERS WITH ADJECTIVES IS THE SAME AS
THAT OF OTHER ‘HEADLESS’ NOMINAL MODIFIERS – ‘headless’ nominal modifiers which makeup a complete NP in Murui, are formed from other word classes (nouns and noun roots,
adjectives, pronouns, as well as number, demonstrative, and interrogative roots) by means of
classifiers (see §4.2.1), e.g. jano-kae (small-CLF.REP:CANOE) ‘little (canoe)’. They take
nominal morphology that includes plural/collective and case marking. In such structures,
classifiers are directly suffixed to nominal roots. Verbal and adjectival roots require a linker
position to be able to take on a classifier, e.g. maka-dɨ-mɨe (walk-LK-CLF:PR.M) ‘(male) who
walks’.
B5. THE OCCURRENCE WITH THE INTENSIFIER eo ‘very’ ‒ the intensifier eo ‘very’ occurs as a
pre-modifier with adjectives and those ‘headless’ nominal modifiers that contain an adjective411
(see §3.3.1 on Murui intensifiers). An example of eo occurring in the adverbial position with
the ‘headless’ nominal modifier is given in (9.20):
(9.20) [bi-e
jɨko]VCS eo
jea-koVCC
this.CTS-CLF:G dog
very ugly-CLF.REP:DOG
‘this dog is very ugly (lit. this dog – very ugly (dog)).’
The intensifier eo can also occur in the adverbial position modifying verbs; it can neither
modify nouns nor ‘headless’ nominal modifiers with adjectival roots (see §3.3.1).
B6. DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES – derived adjectives cannot take the generic
classifier -e (unlike nouns, noun roots, pronouns, as well as number, demonstrative, and
interrogative roots). If they refer to a human referent, they are obligatorily suffixed with the
‘pronominal’ animate classifiers, e.g. uze-ñaiño (white-CLF:PR.F) ‘white woman’. This is
similar to nouns, noun roots, pronouns, and number, demonstrative, and interrogative roots,
but unlike verbal roots which typically occur with ‘derivational’ animate classifiers, e.g.
dobe-ño (crush-CLF:DR.F) ‘basin (for crushing unprocessed yucca)’.","[433, 434, 435, 436]"
"551
B1. CODE MIXING AND INTERJECTIONS – the Spanish negative word no is frequently used in
Murui, as illustrated in (13.67). The positive sí ‘yes’ is almost never ‘switched’ (the
interjection jɨɨ! is used instead). 326(13.67) Monika:navui

C. CLAUSES OF RELATIVE ANTERIORITY AND POSTERIORITY ‒ Murui has two basic ways of
expressing relative posteriority, those marked with -mona and those that occur with the
enclitic =mei or the free form meino. Clauses expressing relative anteriority take the noun
uieko ‘face, front’ followed by the instrumental case marker -do.
C1. RELATIVE POSTERIORITY MARKED WITH -mona ‒ the typical way of marking posteriority is
the ablative -mona ‘from, after’ following a nominalized verb. The ablative case indicates a
certain point in time. The ablative-marked NP typically precedes the main clause. Examples
are given in (12.53-54):

C2. RELATIVE POSTERIORITY MARKED WITH =mei and meino ‒ the posteriority readings are
also frequently achieved by the enclitic =mei ‘so, later’ and the postposition meino ‘later’, as
in (12.55-56) and (12.57-58) below. These forms can be used interchangeably.

expressed in Murui. The only way to cover such meanings is the lexical noun uieko ‘face’
followed by the instrumental -do meaning that denotes a physical location ‘in front’; it is
further semantically extended to cover the meaning of ‘before, first, in advance’, as in
(12.59). 299

D. CLAUSES OF OVERLAP -kana ‒ clauses with -kana describe the length of time of an event
expressed in the subordinate clause with regard to an event happening at the time of299That the primarily meaning of uiekodo here is in fact ‘in front’ is illustrated by the frequent phrase used whenwalking in the forest uie-ko-do jaaitɨ-kue (face-CLF:SPHERICAL-INS go.FUT.LK-1sg) ‘I will go up front.’501
event/state described in the main clause. Semantically, an action expressed by a verb marked
with -kana in the dependent clause is understood as part of the action of a verb of the main
clause. Examples are given in (12.60-64):

Unlike other dependent clauses that include a fully inflected verb, clauses of ‘overlap’ cannot
co-occur with the future tense marker or be negated. Their negative reading comes from the
negative reading of the negated verb in the main verbs.
E. CONDITIONAL CLAUSES ‒ Murui has two conditional constructions: those marked with -ia
and those marked with -na.
E1. REAL CONDITIONAL -ia ‘when’ ‒ the conditional -ia is formed by the suffixation of the
marker -ia (-a when following /i/) to verbs and adjectives in the subordinate clause, as in
(12.65-69). The conditional -ia expresses a real condition, and it is better translated as ‘when’
rather than ‘if’. Conditional clauses always precede the main clause, and are not sensitive to
the ‘same’ vs. ‘different’ subjects distinction.","[523, 524, 525, 526]"

bag). By asking the question, she was simply saying that she wanted some of her daughter’s
cassava.

B. BARE NOUNS – this is a sort of directive one answers to promptly; it serves as a weak
command. Bare nouns seem to be highly elliptical directives, with omitted verb. For instance,
shouting dɨo-kaɨ! (tobacco-CLF:STEM) ‘cigarette’ when entering maloca at night, wanting to
be given a cigarette. The usual way is to ask dɨo-kai kue ine! (tobacco-CLF:STEM 1sg give)
‘give me a cigarette!’.
C. FULLY INFLECTED VERBS CAST IN NON-FUTURE TENSE – there are two types of verbs cast in
non-future tense that can express command-like meanings: those used for 2nd person where
the linker and the pronominal subject markers are fused, and those used for 1st and 2nd person
with fully inflected verbs.
C1. FULLY INFLECTED VERB AND REDUCED LINKER – such constructions have overtones of
kind advice when offering a delicate suggestion. They are used for the 2nd person singular,
dual, and plural, and are usually expressed with an intonation of a question. The syllabic
structure of the pronominal subject markers are reduced: -dɨo > -do and -tɨo > -to, as in atɨdo
‘bring’ in (11.28):470

C2. FULLY INFLECTED VERBS – a fully inflected verb which normally serves as a predicate on
its own can be used as moderate suggestions for 1st and 2nd person singular, dual, and plural,
as illustrated in (11.29). Such clauses are usually accompanied by some paralinguistic cues
(e.g. eye gaze).

D. FULLY INFLECTED VERBS CAST IN FUTURE TENSE – the future tense in Murui is not
exclusively used to indicate future actions or processes, but also to express deontic modalities
such as issuing requirements which must be executed at a later time (either in the immediate
or remote future). 287 There are two types of command strategies with fully inflected verbs
cast in future tense: those used for 2nd person where the linker and the pronominal subject
markers are fused and used for 1st and 2nd person with fully inflected verbs.
D1. FULLY INFLECTED VERB, FUTURE TENSE, AND REDUCED LINKER – such constructions have
stronger overtones than those of type C1-2, and are used for offering a stronger type of
suggestion. The pronominal subject marker on the verb is reduced -tɨo > -to, as in (11.30):

7.3Spatial settingMurui has two distinct direction markers, the andative and the ventive, by which the language
explicitly encodes the shift in the orientation to the reference point, the speaker. Spatial
setting of a clause is typically shown with oblique noun phrases, adverbs, and demonstratives.
The direction markers are not restricted to any person or TAME specification. The andative
and the ventive markers are discussed in turn.","[390, 391]"
"7.2.3.3 Obligation
In addition to the imperative (§11.1), Murui uses the future event nominalizer -ye (slot 15)
(often followed by the emphatic -za, §11.1.4) to express obligation, and, when -ye is negated,
also prohibition of sorts. Its reading is always impersonal in nature (unlike the readings of
Murui imperatives):

7.2.3.4 Epistemic modality
Murui epistemic modality covers speaker’s degree of confidence in utterance, willingness to
vouch for information, and the ‘attitude’ of the speaker towards that information. It is
expressed with two choices (slot 18): =za (meaning ‘unconfirmed certainty’ from the
speaker’s perspective)’ and =dɨ (‘confirmed certainty’, as the speaker believes it to be ‘true,
valid’)’; see Wojtylak (forthcoming-c) for details. Modality-neutral terms are unmarked
forms expressed in the same way as the evidentiality-neutral verbs. Such unmarked355
statements can be based on all kinds of semantic parameters, e.g. sensory evidence,
assumption, and general knowledge. Murui epistemic modality markers are used in
declarative clauses.
A. ‘UNCONFIRMED CERTAINTY’ =za ‒ the epistemic marker =za expresses speakers’ fair
conviction that something must be the case (based on their own knowledge and experience)
but it is not yet completely affirmed (as opposed to the ‘confirmed certainty’ =dɨ, see further
this section). 229 Compare the following examples:
(7.116) a. naiñoOBLIQUE fɨɨ-kaPRED
CLF:DR.F
rob-PASS
‘(It) was stolen by her.’ (general statement)
b. nai-ñoOBLIQUE
fɨɨ-ka=zaPRED
ANA.SP-CLF:DR.F rob-PASS=UNCERT
‘(It) must have been stolen by her.’ (unconfirmed)
The following excerpt in (7.117) is a narration about how Murui children cease to speak
Murui. In that example, the speaker is condemning this. As there are still some children who
speak the language, he is using =za (implying in a subtle way all children seem to adapt to
‘the new ways’):

‘Then (lit. in this situation), children got used to (it). They do not know the words.’229The ‘uncorfirmed certainty’ =za therefore has often emphatic-like readings. To indicate uncertainty inMurui, one frequently uses periphrastic expressions, such as those with the verbal root izoi- meaning ‘be
similar’. Murui has also an adverb nɨbaɨ ‘maybe’ indicating uncertainly. It has a dubitative meaning, that is
somewhat different from =za. It occurs in the contexts of verbs marked with the epistemic =dɨ but not =za.","[379, 380]"
"7.2.4.2 Epistemic modality vs. evidentiality
Although evidentiality and epistemic modality (§7.2.3.4) markers occur in the same slot on
the verb and are mutually exclusive, they encode different semantic parameters. Murui
evidentiality covers two choices, ‘reported’ (overtly marked) and ‘everything else’
(unmarked). Epistemic modality offers three choices, the overtly marked certainty
‘confirmed’ and ‘unconfirmed’, and the unmarked epistemic-neutral value.
While evidentiality is an obligatory grammatical category in Murui, epistemic
modality is not. Instead, it is rather concerned with the expression of speakers’ willingness to
vouch for the contents of the sentence. If speakers are reluctant to express any kind of
‘attitude’ towards the utterance, the verb remains ‘unspecified’ (that is, unmarked).
Modality markers can be semantically extended to express evidential meanings. The233Bora reported evidential is used in traditional stories and legends (Thiesen and Weber 2012).",[390]

7.2.1.2 Future
Future covers events expected to happen either in near or distant indefinite future. The
morphological expression of future tense is done by regular suffixation with -it(ɨ) and/or
vowel lengthening (see §2.5 on morphophonological processes applicable to verbal roots that
express the future tense). 215 The affixation and apophony is applied to verbal roots regardless
of their polarity. Murui future tense marking is obligatory throughout texts and can never be
omitted without a change in meaning. A number of examples are presented below. (7.18)
refers to near future (‘tomorrow’), (7.19) talks about distant future; (7.20) is a statement
about the future in general.

"10.2.4 Negation of verbless clauses
Murui verbless clauses are employed to express identity, possession, and benefaction. To
negate such clauses, intransitive predicates are used.
The core arguments of verbless clauses, Verbless Clause Subject (VCS) and Verbless
Clause Complement (VCC), are shown by adposition. VCS and VCC do not receive any450
distinctive marking. 279 The preferred order for the constituents in verbless clauses is
generally VCS - VCC (carried over from the preferred SV and AOV constituent orders).
Verbless clauses are never employed to express location or existence. Some examples are
given below:
mano-ri-raɨ-ma=dɨ]VCC
(10.76) [oo ɨni]VCS
2sg husband heal-DUR-AGT-CLF:DR.M=S/A.TOP

jea-gaɨVCC
this.CTS-CLF:G basket-CLF:BASKET ugly-CLF:BASKET
‘This is an ugly basket (lit. this basket - ugly (basket)).’
To negate a verbless clause and to express it the future tense, former VCC’s have to function
as head of an intransitive predicate. This is illustrated in (10.79-80). Compare (10.76) above
with (10.79) below. To negate the verbless clause expressing identity with the noun in the
non-S function in (10.76) becomes a head of an intransitive predicate in (10.76), and to be
negated, it is followed by the negation marker -ñe and further predicate marking. This is
similar in examples (10.78) and (10.80).

"13.1 Repetition of phrases and clauses
Murui discourse is full of phrasal and clausal repetitions that are often verbatim. Such
repetitions emphasize significance of a phrase, clause, or a sentence within texts. They have
mostly aspectual meanings (i.e. reiteration of an action, its prolonged duration, intensity and
emphasis). Repetition is different from bridging constructions (discussed in §13.2) in that it is
not used to organize discourse; rather it can be considered an aspectual strategy of a sort.
In Murui, phrases and sentences are commonly repeated up to three times, especially in
narratives. An example of verbatim repetitions is presented in (13.1), a textual excerpt from a
story about preparations for traditional celebrations in the maloca. By means of the repetition
of words and phrases, the speaker emphasizes the importance of the travel they undertook in
order not to arrive for the celebration empty-handed, at the same time, making a clear
reference to the prolonged duration and the intensity of their journey (repeated clauses and
sentences are in bold).",[538]

Although the conditional dependent clause generally precedes the main clause, under certain
pragmatic conditions, it can also follow it. In (12.75) a speaker wanted to emphasize the fact
that the next day they would push a canoe onto a creek. Pushing the canoe through wet grass
would be much easier than through dry grassland. This was during the rainy season during
which rain would fall everyday; thus the speaker knew that the next day surely it would rain

conditional -ia ‘when’, the conditional -na ‘if’ is formed on the edge of fully inflected verbs
and adjectives. The conditional clause occurs always in the sentence initial position; the order

of the S-MARK -femo is baaɨfemo ‘on the over there side (i.e. ahead of)’ (expressing relative

G. CLAUSES OF RESULT AND REASON take nominalizations as their arguments; they are
followed by postposition jira ‘reason’, muidona ‘for reason’, mamedo ‘in the name of’, and
the noun mame-kɨ-do (name-CLF:INHER-INS) ‘in the name of, due to’. 304304In Murui, adpositions are grammatically similar to nouns (see §3.3.6).","[530, 531]"
"13.3.1 Narratives
Murui narratives are comprised of various types of traditional stories, such as the
performative genres rafue (ritual narrations that make reference to Murui norms and laws,
ancestral linkage, etc.) and bakakɨ (mythological narrations) (Echeverri, 1997: 30; Wojtylak,
2015a: 552). The rafue and bakakɨ narrations, unlike other types of genres, are monologues
told during evening gatherings at the communal roundhouses. They are usually told on
certain occasions. For instance, the elder Lucio Agga Calderón would narrate certain types of
normative rafue, whenever his sons would misbehave. Rafue narrations are meant to teach
about the ‘old’ ways of the Murui ancestors, and when told, they would always make a direct
reference to people’s current existence and practices. Bakakɨ, on the other hand, are
narrations about mythical animals, such as the possum jimenakɨ (see (2.1) in §2.1.1), or the
mythical heroes Jitoma and Kechatoma (see examples (13.2), (13.3) and (13.15) above).
Many of these stories have a morale. In case of the narrations of the journeys of Jitoma and
his brother Kechatoma, the stories tell about their wrong doings and subsequent punishments.
Rafue and bakakɨ are often cast in remote past, shown by the use of the remote habitual527
marker (see §7.2.2.4). Another type of monologues are the hunting narratives which use
hunting register (see §1.3.8), and chants (that have a special intonation contour and are
usually whispered).
The rafue and bakakɨ narratives usually start by introducing a theme of a narration,
and frequently use the verb yo(te) ‘tell’, as in (13.16).

speech (note that the reported enclitic =ta is not used in such traditional narratives, see
§7.2.4). This is illustrated in (13.17), a continuation of the advice of the Grandfather Jobai to
Jitoma and Kechatoma in (13.15) above.

Perhaps one of the the most salient feature of Murui narratives, especially those of the rafue
type, are the sentence final markers jɨɨ ‘yes’ and jmm ‘hm’, followed by a significant pause.
An example of jmm is illustrated in (13.18) (see e.g. examples T1.15, T1.16, and T1.19 in the
Appendix).

‘Friends are given it.’
The interjections jɨɨ and jmm help the speaker to collect their thoughts and proceed with the
narration. Although the rafue and bakakɨ genres are primarily monologues, they do require528
active participation of those who listen. It is customary for men (or a specific individual who
the rafue is meant for) to vigorously respond jɨɨ, as a sign of acknowledgment of the elder’s
words. The interjection jmm is used for ‘less vigorous’ response (e.g. for instance when an
elder is scolding their sons). Occasionally, as a sign of agreement, the person who narrates
rafue, can use both markers, and continue with the narration. This is illustrated in (13.19).

It is also not unusual for the hearers to repeat a speaker’s last word, words, or even an entire
phrase. The repeated bit of information can also be elaborated by adding additional elements,
as shown in (13.20).

say-LK-3The narratives frequently finish with a number of formulaic expressions containing the
auditory demonstrative aki- ‘this/that (as heard)’ and akɨ ‘auditory there’ (see §3.3.3). A
number of such formulaic expressions are given in (13.22) (see also T1.81 and T4.41 in the

future, as illustrated below:
Diagram 7.1 Expression of tense in Murui
Murui tenseNon-futureFutureWhile the non-future tense is the unmarked ‘default’ verb form, the future tense is marked by
a suffix (slot 14 on the verb structure, see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1) and/or vowel lengthening of
verbal roots. 212 The future tense markers precede the allomophs of the verbal linker -dɨ and tɨ which, in turn, are followed by the cross-referencing S/A markers. This is illustrated in
(7.4) (for non-future) and in (7.5) (for future) below:

type of tense markers. These are verbless clauses, as illustrated in (7.6):

[oo biya-ma]VCC
ANA.SP-CLF:PR.M 2sg mothers.brother-CLF:DR.M
‘I am your uncle (lit. I - your uncle).’
To express time specification, the VCC argument becomes the S NP and takes predicate
marking, as in (7.7):212Phonological processes that apply to roots are discussed in §2.5.","[347, 348, 349]"
"319The attention getting marker baa occurs also in the neigbouring Tucano (Ramirez, 1997: 341-342) (see also§13.4). Tariana has the ‘urging’ particle ne to attract attention (Aikhenvald, p.c.).",[567]
