"8.7. Negation
Two basic types of negative forms can be found in the language, namely
periphrastic negation and morphological negation. These types of negation are
presented here in terms of forms rather than scope because it is not the aim of this section
530to present an in-depth description of negation in terms of its scope. Also, for the most
part, the sentence versus constituent scope of negation (Keenan 1964, Payne 1985)
follows from their periphrastic and morphological form, respectively. In Pickering 1978
the author presents a description specifically on negation in Apurinã, where he applies the
traditional tests for determining the scope of negation and the classification thereby
reached. Morphological negation is marked with the negative attributive marker m(a)(described in 5.3.2), yielding an objective descriptive verb. The example in (108)
illustrates m(a)- in a verb that also takes the negative relative marker -katu in a relative
clause (described in detail in the next chapter, in the subsection 9.1.1.1.4):
O
NEG-V-REL.NEG.o
V
upũpe
108. kuki-nhi
m-areka-kati-nhi
man-AFFECT NEG-be.good-REL.NEG.M-AFFECT die
‘The man who is bad died.’
Lit.: ‘The man who is “non-good” died.’
Thus, the Apurinã negative morphological marker is comparable to the English
negative prefixes un- (as in undo, uneasy, unborn etc.), iC- (as in impossible, illogical
etc.), and non- (as in non-existent, non-sense, etc.), except that m(a)- is restricted to the
subclass of objective descriptive intransitive verbs. See 5.3.2 for more on m(a)-.
As the examples in (109a-b) indicate, the periphrastic negation particle kona
(introduced in 6.7.3 as a negative polarity particle) can precede or follow a pre-verbal
constituent:
S NEG V-o
109a. nota kona sa-ru
1SG not go-3M.O
‘I’m not going there.’531NEG S
V-o
b. kona nota sa-ru
not 1SG go-3M.O
‘I’m not going there.’
NEG V-o
c. kona hareka-ru
not be.good
‘It’s not good’
NEG V-o
d. ??hareka-ru kona
be.good
not
??‘It’s not good’
As can be seen from (109c), kona is also the form used in sentences with descriptive
predicates. The example given in (109d), is preceded by question markers to illustrate
the fact that I have no attested instance of a negative particle occurring post-verbally.
As already mentioned in 6.7.3, kona is also the form normally used as the shortest
(linguistic) answer to a polar question, in the role of counterpart of the positive polarity
particle aru. Furthermore, in some speech varieties (for example, the one spoken in the
northern-most village, i.e. Jatuarana) the negative can undergo extreme phonological
shortening. As shown in (110), kona can be shortened to /a/ before a consonant-initial
word or to /n/ before a vowel-initial word:20
NEG#s-V
110a. a#n-ayata-panhi
NEG#hunt-IMPFTV
‘I’m not going to go hunt.’20In these speech varieties, sometimes kona is reduced to just nasalization in fast speech rates.","[561, 562, 563]"
"6.7.2Subordinator Particle
There is also one clear case of a subordinator particle, which is kotxi (or kota, dependingon speech variety) ‘because’, as the example in (35) illustrates. The syntactic properties of this
subordinator are presented in chapter 9, in subsection 9.1.3.1.
35. nu-su-pe-ka-ko
kotxi
nu-sãpaka
1SG-go-PFTV-PRED-FUT because 1SG-be.tired
‘I’ll get going because I’m tired.’6.7.3 Polarity Particles: Negative, Positive
The polarity particles are simply the word forms used to answer polar questions. They
are kona ‘not, no’ and aru1 ‘yes’. As suggested by the gloss, the negative particle kona can be
used as the answer to polar questions and, also, it can negate phrasal expressions. This, however,
is only part of the syntactic functions of polarity particles. The negative particle can be used
more than as an answer to polar questions, and its functions and scope are described in detail in
the context of simplex clauses in the chapter 8, in 8.7.
371One particularity about the positive polarity marker, aru1 ‘yes’, which must be noticed is
that it is the only one (among all particles) that can take the suffix -te ‘really, indeed’, as in
aru1-te ‘yes indeed; of course’. Thus, in this respect, aru1 differs from other particles. Polarity
particles are treated here separately from the discourse particles described next because, although
they may be used under particular discourse contexts with functions that can only be described in
terms of discourse-pragmatic factors, they have a well established prototypical function, namely
to mark the polarity of an event/state or of one of its parts. Aside from that, there is at least one
homophonous form, aru2, whose specific function is to serve as a sort of discourse link, thus
without the meaning associated with a polarity particle.","[402, 403]"
"8.8.2 Interrogative Speech Acts
Interrogative speech acts are conventionally used to seek information, and they
can be divided in two major types: polar questions and information questions. Aside
from the formal differences described in the following subsections, polar and information
questions differ in that the former are marked by a rising intonation.
A detailed description of interrogative sentences in Apurinã was presented in
Pickering 1977b, and a short mention of it in Pickering 1971. Although the data
motivating the analysis presented here (as is also true of every other piece of the
dissertation) are those from my own field research, thus independent from those used by
Pickering, the results do not generally differ in any significant way from Pickering’s first535analysis. Minor differences may be due to a speech variety I have not yet had the chance
to investigate.
8.8.2.1Polar (Yes/No) Questions
Polar questions are used to seek “a comment on the degree of truth of thequestioned proposition” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:179), normally elicit as answers the
positive or negative polarity particles aru ‘yes’ or kona ‘no’ (described in 6.7.3), and are
only marked prosodically by the rising intonation. This conventionalized use of rising
intonation to mark polar questions can, nevertheless, be characterized as a
grammaticalized property of interrogative sentences. In (112), the first two examples
(112a-b) illustrate polar questions for clauses with transitive verbs, and the two last
examples (112c-d) illustrate polar questions for clauses with intransitive verbs. In all of
these examples, the only element that distinguishes the interrogative clauses from their
declarative counterpart is the rising intonation:22s-V-o

ãkiti?
2SG-shoot-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Did you shoot the jaguar?’22I have only recently attested that the speech variety of the Fortaleza village has the morphema –ta, used in the verb
base to mark polar questions. The equivalent of the sentence in (112b) in this speech community will be
pi-keta-ta-ru ãkiti ‘Did you shoot the jaguar?’. This same morpheme is not present in the speech of the Japiim
village.","[566, 567]"

-keru

still uncertain of, as will be made explicit in the subsections where they are respectively
described. Except for the forms having a question mark, all other relative pronominal
markers in the language have been clearly attested. As suggested by the information
summarized in Table 1, the relative pronominal markers form a rich system for coding
various piece of information about the relative clause and its components: i.e. the
grammatical relation of the headREL in the relative clause, as well as its gender and
number; the (positive/negative) polarity of the verb; the “actorlessness” of the verb; and a
sort of hierarchical role of the participants when expressed as pronominal forms.
Although it is possible to break down the relative pronominal markers given in Table 1
564into component parts, for the moment they will be described in terms of the general
function these four-segment phonemic clusters have as markers of ClRELs. The final
subsection in 9.1.1.5 will present a more detailed morphological breakdown of these
tetrad-partite phonemic clusters, with a discussion on the syntactic status of the verb
which results from the presence of such clusters.
Various of the examples illustrating the use of relative pronominal markers
originate in elicited material. I have chosen to use such data here for two major reasons:
First, because they are used systematically enough in elicited material so as to suggest
that speakers are aware of their function in the language grammar, and, second, because
some of the relative pronominal forms are not easily found in text material (in, general,
regardless of genre). The extent to which they are not found so often in text material may
suggest that (at least for some speakers) they are in the process of going out of use, either
due to language contact influence or just as a natural consequence of internal language
change. The next subsections describe each of the functions of the relative pronominal
forms listed in the table above, and the subtypes of ClRELs distinguished by these
pronominal forms.
9.1.1.1.2The Role of the HeadREL in the Relative ClauseThe first opposition encoded by the relative markers that is illustrated below is
that concerning their role in the clause while encoding core grammatical relations, i.e.
subject and objects. The sentences in (6) illustrate two independent clauses. The subject
of the first and second clauses are both suto ‘woman’, and (in the context used here) they
are coreferential. In order to relativize the subject of the first clause, i.e. suto, making
this subject a headREL, the coreferential relative pronominal marker -karo is added to the
565verb of the first clause. The resulting complex sentence (containing a relative clause) in
(7) (already given above in (2) is formed when the two sentences in (6) are combined:
O
S
V
6a. kuku suto
karota
man woman hurt
‘The woman hurt the man.’
S
V
b. suto
apo-pe
woman arrive-PFTV
‘The woman arrived.’
S/S
[O
V-rel.s ]ClREL
V
7. suto
kuku karota-karo
apo-pe
woman man hurt-REL.F.POS.S arrive-PFTV
‘The woman who hurt the man arrived.’
That is, as a result of adding -karo to the verb of the sentence in (6a), this sentence is
“nominalized”, becoming a relative clause embedded as the subject of the matrix clause.
(The meaning of the term “nominalized” as it applies to ClRELs is discussed in detail in
9.1.1.6.)
In contrast to (7) the next example in (8) has suto again as the headREL and kuku
karota-kuto ‘whom the man hurt’ is the ClREL:
S/O
[S
V-rel.o
]ClREL V
8. suto
kuku
karota-kuto
apo-pe
woman man
hurt-REL.F.O
arrive-PFTV
‘The woman whom the man hurt has arrived.’
While in (7) the relative pronominal marker is -karu, the example in (8) shows a different
pronominal marker attached to the verb, namely -kuto. As is clear in (8), when the
relative pronominal marker -karo is replaced with the relative pronominal marker -kuto
566the result is that the headREL suto is interpreted as the object of the ClREL. Note that since
suto ‘woman’ is the headREL in both the complex sentences in (7) and (8) there is no
difference in person or gender information. Moreover, since everything else in (7) and
(8) is the same, the only distinct grammatical functions -karo and -kuto may correspond
to is that of subject and object, respectively. Hence the relative pronominal markers
directly encode the subject versus object grammatical distinction.
In (9a), the example illustrates a case where the headREL, suto, is the goal
argument of the verb of the ClREL, nhipoko-ru2 nu-suka-kuto ‘whom I gave the food to’,
whereas in (9b) it is nhipoko-ru2 ‘food-UNPOSS’ that is the headREL, showing that both
the expressions for undergoer (here including the argument of objective descritive verbs)
and the expressions for goal arguments follow the same relativization strategy:

‘The food that I gave to the woman was good.’
In complex sentences containing ClRELs the only grammatical relation which is
relevant for relativization is that played by the headREL in the ClREL. That is, the role of
the headREL in the matrix clause is completely irrelevant for the formal encoding of
relativization in Apurinã. This irrelevance of the role of the headREL in the matrix clause
for the formal markings of ClRELs can be seen by comparing the examples given in (7),
(8) and (9) with the following examples in (10). In all the examples of ClRELs in (7), (8)
and (9a) the headREL is subject in the matrix clause, and both the relative pronominal
567markers -karo and -kuto occur in all those examples. In the examples in (10), the object
pronominal marker -ro in n-apoko-ro shows that the headREL suto is object in the matrix
clause, and, again, both -karo and -kuto occur:

can also be marked for gender and number in ways that can potentially help to identify
the role of the headREL. Insofar as gender and number help to (indirectly) determine the
core grammatical relation of the headREL they function as redundant markers of the
syntactic role of the headREL in the ClREL.
In order to demonstrate how gender is encoded by the relative pronominal
markers, we can start by observing the gender of the headREL in (7) above, contrasting it
with the following example in (11). While in (7) the headREL is suto ‘woman’, which is
modified by the ClREL kuku karota-karo ‘who hurt the man’, in (11) the headREL is kuku
‘man’, which is modified by the ClREL suto karotakaru ‘who hurt the woman’. When we
contrast examples (7) and (11), where the headRELs differ in that one is feminine and the
other is masculine, we see that the relative pronominal marker agrees with the gender of568its respective coreferential headREL. The way this gender agreement is shown is by
alternating the last vowel of the relative pronominal marker, i.e. /o/ versus /u/:
S/S

V-rel.s ]ClREL
V
11. kuku suto
karota-karu
apo-pe
man woman hurt-REL.M.POS.S arrive-PFTV
‘The man who hurt the woman has arrived.’
Analogously to (7) and (11), (8) and (12) can be compared to produce similar
results for the relative object pronominal markers. So, while -kuto in (8) was shown to
agree with the headREL suto, in (12) the relative object pronominal form -kutu is shown to
agree with the headREL kuku.

V-rel.o ]ClREL V
12. kuku suto
karota-kutu
apo-pe
man woman hurt-REL.M.O arrive-PFTV
‘The man whom the woman hurt has arrived.’
Finally, another piece of information about the headREL that is encoded in the
relative pronominal marker is the number. In the examples in (13) the clauses illustrate
the plurality expressed in the pronominal relative markers for subject and object,
respectively. -kanu is used for subject plural in (13a), coreferential with the plural
headREL suto-wako-ro ‘women’; whereas in (13b) -kunu is used for object plural, also
coreferential with the plural headREL sutowakoro:

The following examples in (14) are analogous to those in (13), and they have the
masculine headREL kuku-wako-ru ‘men’ coreferential with the plural relative pronominal
markers in the verbs. These examples are only given to show that plural relative
pronominal markers (both subject and object forms) do not encode the gender distinction.
That is, the relative pronominal forms -kanu and -kunu can agree with both masculine
and feminine nouns, as the examples below show; in other words, there are no feminine
plural forms such as *-kano or *-kuno.

‘The men whom I saw you didn’t see.’9.1.1.1.4Relative Clauses and the Polarity of the VerbIn order to illustrate the polarity agreement, we can compare the examples in (7)
and (10) with the following examples in (15). The first difference to note is the addition
of the privative marker ma- to the verb. As shown in 5.3.1, ma- is a negation marker that
forms descriptive verbs. When the example in (15a) is compared with (7), it becomes
clear that the relative pronominal marker changes its form to agree with the negative
marker ma-. The comparison can also be made between (10) and (15b) to produce the
570same analytical result. The way the relative pronominal marker changes is by alternating
between the polarity markers -r and -t, where the first marks positive and the latter marks
negative polarities:

PRIV-snore-INTR-VBLZ-REL.NEG.F wake

Notice that, although polarity markers are restricted to descriptive verbs (i.e.
intransitive verbs that take object rather than subject pronominal markers), subject but not
object relative pronominal markers inflect for polarity. This is unexpected, since
descriptive verbs take object rather than subject pronominal markers.
9.1.1.1.5The Distribution of Relative ClausesIn analyzing the position of the ClREL in relation to the headREL (or vice-versa)
there are three possible outcomes. The first possibility is for the ClREL to precede the
headREL; the second is for the ClREL to follow the headREL; and, the third is for the ClREL
to occur discontinuously on both sides of the headREL. The labels prenominal,
postnominal, and circumnominal (or internal-head) relative clauses are found in the
literature (Keenan 1985:143, Comrie 1989:45-46) referring to ClRELs when they occur,
respectively, before, after, or on both sides of the headREL. These labels are used here in
the description of the distribution of ClRELs.
571In all examples of complex sentences containing a relative clause seen so far the
ClREL follows the headREL, thus characterizing the postnominal type of relative clause.
This constitutes the most common and, in an informal sense, the “unmarked” distribution
of the ClREL in relation to the headREL. Postnominal ClRELs are “unmarked” in the sense
that they are the ones naturally offered by the speaker when translating relative clauses
from Portuguese, they are the most frequent type, and, most importantly, because they
also are the ones most easily accepted by the speaker.2
Prenominal ClRELs are also attested in texts as well as in elicited material, as the
following examples in (16) show. In (16a) suto atama-nanu-ta-karu ‘who was looking at
the woman’ is the ClREL that precedes the headREL kuku ‘man’. In (16b) the ClREL is kuku
atama-nanu-ta-karo ‘who was looking at the man’ which precedes the headREL suto
‘woman’:

In the examples in (16) the headREL functions as subject of the ClREL. In (17) the
examples are illustrative of complex sentences whose headREL functions as the object of2One could argue that speakers may be influenced by Portuguese (wherein postnominal ClRELs are the only type found)
while translating Portuguese ClREL into Apurinã; however, speakers’ judgments of postnominal ClRELs are the same
when these clauses are presented to them in Apurinã. Moreover, a Portuguese influence would NOT explain why
prenominal ClRELs are disfavored/rejected in the same contexts where postnominal ones are preferred —as the
following paragraphs show.","[595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603]"
"591semantic role of its subject is converted into undergoer. The third column (and subcolumns under Polarity & Number) lists the morphemes that may mark cumulatively both
polarity and number. Finally, the fourth column (and sub-columns under Gender) lists
the morphemes for masculine and feminine. Notice also that, as is made explicit in the
table below, the major distinctions in the types of ClRELs can be described in terms of
distinctions of GRs & Voice, Polarity & Number, and Gender, thus producing tripartite
morphemic clusters. That is, at the same time that relative pronominal markers are
segmentable into three morphological markers (GRs & Voice, Polarity & Number, and
Gender), they also cluster together to function as relativizers.

-oWhen these tripartite morphemic clusters are contrasted to the way languages
generally mark ClRELs, they are found to be somewhat comparable to the relative
pronouns commonly found in European languages (Keenan 1985:149-152, Comrie
1989: 149-150, Givón 1990:656-658). Similar to relative pronouns, relative pronominal
markers in Apurinã occur inside the ClREL indicating the role of the headREL, and
functioning as subordinators. So, for example, the pairs -k-a-r-u/r-o vs. -k-u-t-u/t-o, in
Apurinã, and who vs. whom, in English, are both relative pronominal forms that occur
inside the ClREL, marking the headREL as subject and object respectively. The differences592between these two pairs are in their phonological status (as bound vs. free forms), in the
number of functional properties they encode (i.e. grammatical relation, voice, polarity,
number and gender in Apurinã vs. grammatical relation and animacy in English), in their
position inside the ClREL (i.e. following the verb in Apurinã vs. initial in the ClREL in
English), and, finally, in that only the Apurinã forms can also mark headless ClRELs.
Relative pronominal markers can also be compared with nominalizers, as the following
discussion shows.
9.1.1.6The Syntactic Category of the “Verb-REL” in Relative Clauses: Verbalor Nominal?
One final issue about ClRELs is with respect to the syntactic status of the verb of
the ClRELs as a result of taking the relative pronominal markers. (VREL is used hereafter
to refer to the verb of a ClREL.) In the description of the noun morphology in chapter 4,
relative pronominal markers are listed as relativizing nominalizers under 4.4.6. Since to
refer to the tripartite morphemic clusters marking the predicate of VRELs as both
nominalizers and pronominal forms suggests a misapplication of typical derivational-like
versus typical inflectional-like properties, some clarification is in order.
It is certainly possible for a language to make use of nominalizations to mark
ClRELs (Givón 1990:663-666)5. In Apurinã there are two major pieces of evidence that
the VRELs marked with the tripartite morphemic clusters listed in the table above are
nominalized forms: one morphological and the other syntactic. In the discussion that
follows, to say that VREL is “nominal” (or “deverbal”) or “verbal” means that VREL can5Where examples from Turkish, Ute and Lhasa Tibetan are cited.","[622, 623, 624]"

(morpho)syntactic properties such as grammatical relations, polarity, number, gender,
and, perhaps, person hierarchy. A full description of the relativizing markers cannot be
presented before the sentence structure is described; for this reason, the detailed analysis
of relativizing markers will be delayed until chapter 9, where complex sentences are also
described. I can, however, already anticipate that, different from the other nominal forms
presented above, the forms taking relativizing markers cannot be straightforwardly
defined as nouns (and, as we will see in chapter 9, they cannot be straightforwardly
defined as verbs either). One sort of morphological evidence for arguing that the forms
taking relativizing markers are nouns is that they can take oblique markers (described
later under 7.1.2 as a property of (pro)nouns). So, in (89) the form taking the feminine
object relative marker -kuto is followed by the goal oblique marker -mokaru (described
later under 7.1.2.4):
‘to the one taken away
(e.g. kidnapped one)’89. anhi-kuto-mokaru
take.out-REL.SG.F.O-GOALHowever, as we will see in the discussion on relative clauses in chapter 9, there are good
reasons to argue that relativized forms share both a subset of nominal as well as a subset246of verbal properties. Under an analysis of the forms taking relativizing marker as nouns,
the simplest word formation rules for these relativized forms would be as follows:
90. NSt → V + RELZ
As happens to V+iko and, perhaps, to noun forms containing -muna, V+RELZ
forms are NOT sensitive to the alienable-inalienable distinction insofar as no formal
marking is required for them to occur possessed or unpossessed. Detailed illustrations of
construnctions with V+RELZ will be reserved for chapter 9.","[277, 278]"

(I saw the woman who was killed by the man).
The following example is given to show that the relative pronominal marker of
actorless passive ClRELs also inflects for gender. In (22) the headREL is serepi-txi ‘arrow’,
an inherently feminine noun, and, as a result, the masculine relative pronominal marker
-koru gives place to -koro in the verb. And, the example in (23) shows that this same
relative pronominal marker inflects for (negative/positive) polarity as well. In (23) the
negative marker is attached to the verb and, as result, the positive relative marker -koro
gives place to -koto:

In addition to the attested forms, Table 1 also gives the putative form for the
plural form of the actorless passive relative pronominal marker, ??-konu, that could be
arrived at by internal reconstruction, on the basis of its singular counterparts. This form
has not been attested in modern Apurinã and, thus, may never have existed at all.","[607, 608]"

I have not been able to detect any functional distinction between the periphrastic negative
particle and its shortened forms for the specific speech variety in which I have attested
them.
Finally, I should note that further investigation needs to be done with respect to
the details of the scope properties of this periphrastic negative form and its place in the
sentence structure.","[563, 564]"

Faculty of the Graduate School of State
University of New York at Buffalo
in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the
degree ofDoctor of Philosophy
Department of LinguisticsDedicationPopukarũwakorumonhi Popũkarowakoropakunu, para os meus pais and hâi Kade.iiAcknowledgementsFirst and foremost I wish to thank all of the Popũkaruwakoru people who adopted
and cared for me while I was in the field, and who taught me their language. Among
them I thank most especially to the two Mipa Xirĩkaya, to Itaruru, Mainharu, Tokatxi,
Kasãtomaro, Mokato, Koyoru, Matu, Kaneepa, Oyaka, Xirikoyaro, Powami,
Bernaldinho, Artur, Pedrinho, Conceição, Chico Preto, Catuta, Antonio Apurinã, and so
many others. Special thanks go also to Matthew Dryer for guiding me through the
process of writing the dissertation, helping me to learn what I knew and what I still
needed to know about Apurinã and about linguistics. My thanks also to the other readers
of the dissertation, Karin Michelson and Wolfgang Wölck for all of their comments,
suggestions and critiques, and to Sasha (Alexandra Aikhenvald) for making me come to
terms with other Arawak languages. Most special thanks to my parents and to Kade for
their love, care and trust. I thank all the professors of the linguistic departments of
SUNY-Buffalo and of the University of Oregon who in different times taught me
different ways of doing linguistics; among them I thank especially Colette Grinevald,
who first taught me how to go about writing a grammatical description. Late thanks go to
Sarah Lichtenstein, who for some years shared with me certain critical views that need to
be taken into account no matter what. Thanks to Denny Moore, who supported my early
work in important ways. Finally I thank the friends and colleagues who made graduate
school easier and pleasant, and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e
Tecnológico (CNPq), Inter-American Foundation, World Wildlife Fund, and WennerGren Foundation for the financial support during part of my graduate studies.

Facundesfor the degree ofDoctor of Philosophyin the Department of Linguistics to be taken January 2000Title: THE LANGUAGE OF THE APURINÃ PEOPLE OF BRAZIL
(MAIPURE/ARAWAK)A somewhat typologically informed grammatical description of the Apurinã
language is provided, including historical, socio-cultural, demographic and geographic
information about the Apurinã society. The Apurinã communities spread along
tributaries of the Purus River, in western Brazilian Amazon. The grammatical analysis
consists of the phonology, morphology and syntax, with appendixes on language
variation and the design of the Apurinã ortography, a text sample, a vocabulary list, and a
preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari. The grammatical analysis is
based on language internal factors, though with some typological observations on major
aspects. The segmental phonology is simple; morphophonemic alternations are restricted
to pronominal subject/possessor markers and a few other bound morphemes. Stress is
predictably penultimate, though with exceptions that need further investigation.
Although a preliminary analysis of prosodic structures is suggested, more work is
required in this area. The morphology is complex and includes special bound forms
which are partially distinguishable from typical affixes. Nouns and verbs are clearlyxxviidistinct syntactic categories; however, property-referring words are describable as a
subclass of intransitive verbs. Classificatory nouns are used as part of productive noun
compounding and a subset of them can be verb-incorporated and refer back to physical
and shape properties of participants previously mentioned in the discourse —in this way
resembling verb incorporated classifiers of North American languages. The description
of the syntactic organization of the language involves, to a great extent, examining the
functions and behavior of bound morphemes, and reaches its highest complexity in the
system of relative clauses. A subset of property-referring words, called objective
descriptive verbs, presents a morphologically marked split intransitivity system which is
partly based on the semantic class of these verbs. Such a system is typical of Arawak
languages. The constituent order is semi-free; the VO order is the most frequent in texts,
but the patterns of word order correlations point to OV. Overal, the Apurinã language
constitutes a laboratory for examining the interplay between morphological forms and
syntactic structure and functions, providing certain grammatical and semantic categories
and structures that resemble only in part those attested in other languages.xxviiiList of Abreviations and other Conventions UsedA

1.0. Introduction
The purpose of this dissertation is to present a preliminary grammatical
description of the Apurinã language. Apurinã is spoken by the Apurinã indigenous
people of the Northwestern Amazon region of Brazil. The Apurinã population may vary
in number depending on the parameters used to identify as Apurinã a person of Apurinã
ancestry living out of contact with an Apurinã community. Intra-culturally, these
parameters may be determined by the extent to which this person (and/or others in his/her
environment) is aware of his/her Apurinã ancestry. Sometimes, a person may claim the
Apurinã ancestry for potential government help (poorly) provided to indigenous peoples.
The dissertation is organized as follows: Chapter 1 is the introduction, where
some general information on the language and the people who speak it is presented;
chapter 2 presents the phonemic inventory, articulatory phonetics and phonological
analysis of the language, in addition to the orthographic system for the language; chapter
3 presents an introduction to Apurinã morphology where the major concepts used in
chapters 4-7 will be introduced; chapters 4-6 present the morphology of the noun, verb
and closed word classes in that order, and the their relevant syntactic properties; chapter 7
presents a special set of bound morphemes that share properties of affixes as well as of
independent words in a clitic-like fashion; chapter 8 presents the constituent structure
1analysis of phrases and the clause, an analysis of grammatical relations, predicates and
the syntactic properties that operate at the level of simplex sentences; chapter 9 presents
the structure of complex sentences; the conclusion summarizes the major aspects of the
Apurinã grammar covered in this work and points to parts of the grammar that deserve
further investigation. Appendix A summarizes some general information on issues
involved in the design of the Apurinã orthography and on a general picture of dialectal
variation. Appendix B provides a text sample consisting of an Apurinã traditional story.
Appendix C provides a vocabulary sample of the language. Finally, appendix D presents
a summary of a lexical comparison involving Apurinã and its closest extant languages,
Piro and Iñapari to arrive at a preliminary phonological reconstruction of Proto-ApurinãPiro-Iñapari.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]"
"5.3.3 Privative Reversal Marker: wẽThe privative reversal wẽ- is a morpheme that with a somewhat elusive function,
especially because it is rarely used. The few examples so far attested suggest that it
cancels/reverses the negative meaning of the descriptive verb forms it attaches to. This is
illustrated in (85), where in (a-b) the morpheme cancels the negative meaning of the
deprivative marker, and in (c-d) where it cancels the meaning of the independent negative
particle:
85a. ma-wẽ-ere-tu
PRIV-REV-be.pretty-3M.O‘He’s pretty’b. ma-wẽ-ere-to
PRIV-REV-be.pretty-3F.O‘She’s pretty’338c. kona pa-wẽ-ere-ro
not
ATTR-REV-be.pretty-3M.O‘She’s very pretty’d. kona pa-wẽ-ereka-ru
not ATTR-REV-be.good-3M.O‘He’s very nice’5.3.4 Final Remarks on the Morphology of Descriptive Verbs
There are some indications that certain class1 bound forms can also occur with
descriptive verbs, but this requires further investigation. The structure of a descriptive
verb can be represented as in (86), although certain combinations do not occur due to
semantic incompatibility:
86. ATTR/PRIV-REV-Rt5.4. General Syntactic Properties of Verbs
A verb in Apurinã can be distinguished from nouns as well as from other parts of
speech in terms of various syntactic and morphological properties which are specific to
verbs. The morphological distinctions between nouns and verbs, for example, consist of
the inherently nominal or verbal morphological structures described in chapter 4 (for
nouns) and in the previous sections for verbs. The remaining morphological structures of
verbs and nouns (not described in this or in the previous chapter) are the special bound
formatives that either are NOT inherently verbal or nominal, respectively, or they interact
in special ways with clausal or phrasal structures. These special bound formatives will be
described in detail in the next chapter.
A major syntactic distinction between nouns and verbs is manifested in the formal
expression of the sub-categorization for core semantic relations, which is specific to
339verbs. Although this sub-categorization per se can be described as lexical semantic
properties of verbs, its formal expression is structured in syntactic terms. For example,
the root form nhipoko- occurs in (87a) with the unpossessed marker -ru2 to form a noun
that expresses the subject of the verb hareka ‘to be good’. In (87b), the bound root
nhipoko- occurs with the possessed marker -re2 to refer to the possessed element in a
construction where the possessor is expressed as nota ‘1SG’:
87a. nhipoko-ru2
hare-ka
food-UNPOSS be.good-PRED
‘The food is good.’
b. nota nhipoko-re2
1SG food-POSSED
‘my food...’
c. *nota nhipoko-ru2
1SG food-UNPOSSED
(My food; I eat)
d. nota nhipoko-ta
1SG food-VBLZ
‘I eat.’
As follows from the syntactic description of nouns presented above, (87a-b) illustrate two
of the syntactic properties of nouns. The example in (87c) shows that nota cannot be
interpreted as the syntactic expression of a possessor or a subject when occurring with
nhipoko- marked by the unpossessed suffix -ru2. The reason why nota in (87c) cannot be
interpreted as subject follows from the presence of the unpossessed marker -ru2 (as
described in detail in 5.1.2), which makes the bound root into a noun, not into a verb. As
a noun, nhipoko-ru2 does not subcategorize for subjects. Moreover, as shown by (87d),
only verbs subcategorize for grammatical arguments (such as, e.g., subject) and, hence
allow for their syntactic expression in a clause. That is, (87d) is a grammatical clause
340because the verbalizer -ta has been added to nhipoko-, thus forming a verb (in this case
an intransitive one) that, like any non-objective descriptive verb in the language, requires
a subject. Exceptions to this pattern will consist of the class of non-verbal predicates
(described in 9.2.2), but in which cases certain constraints on such predicates take place
to transform non-verbal predicates into the sort of exceptions that only confirm the
general property described here for verbs.
The following examples are given to show that the syntactic difference between
(87b) and (87c) is also reflected in the distributional behavior of their constituting
elements. So, (88a) is ungrammatical while (88b) is perfectly grammatical because
arguments of a verb can occur pre- as well as post-verbally, whereas the genitive of a
possessive construction can only occur preceding the nominal form expressing the
possessor (see description of noun phrases in 8.2.1):
88a. *nhi-nhipoko-re2 nota
food-POSSED 1SG
(my food.)
b. nhi-nhipoko-ta
nota
1SG-food-VBLZ 1SG
‘I eat.’
Although it is true that, as was shown earlier in the previous chapter (see 4.1),
certain nouns have their own subcategorization frame (for example, inalienable nouns
subcategorize for taking a possessor), the subcategorization distinction involving nouns
and verbs, however, still obtains, since what this subset of nouns subcategorizes for are
not the same things verbs subcategorize for. Other syntactic properties that can
distinguish verbs from nouns include formal and behavioral reflexes of valence changing
operations, but these are presented along with the description of simple clauses in the
341next chapter. Finally, so far I have not attested any clear instance of labile verbs in the
language.","[369, 370, 371, 372, 373]"
"5.3.2 Negative Attributive (or Privative) Markers: m(a)-…and …-tu/-to
The negative attributive (hereafter privative) markers, i.e. m(a)-… and
…-tu/-to, are morphemes that attach to nominal or descriptive verb bases to indicate that
the notional subject of the resulting descriptive verb lacks the property borne by the
lexical base the affix attaches to. A privative marker, thus, has the opposite
function/meaning of the (positive) attributive markers. The privative marker is realized
as ma- before a consonant and as m- before a vowel.14 The presence of the privative
marker m(a)- triggers a morphologically conditioned allomorphy on third person object
markers, such that the third person masculine and feminine object markers, i.e. -ru and
-ro, change into -tu and -to respectively. In the next examples, m(a)- attaches to
descriptive verb bases in (84a-b), and to inalienable noun bases in (84c-d), and in allout that the same roots illustrated here are treated as free roots in the speech variety of the Fortaleza village (Marahã
area); that is, the examples in (82) are all grammatical for speakers of the Fortaleza village.
14
I have, however, found at least one speaker in the Japiim village who only produces the ma- form as the privative
marker.",[368]
"8.1.1 The Structure of Noun Phrases
Noun phrases are nominal constructions that can be structurally motivated on the
basis of negative/positive evidence from both the replacement and movement tests. NPs
can be divided into oblique or caseless noun phrases on the basis of whether they take an
oblique marker or not. The oblique markers were morphologically described in the
448previous chapter, in 7.1.1 (and the syntactic function of the (pro)nominal expressions
where they occur will be further discussed in the next chapter, in 8.2-3). The first
subsection, below will describe caseless nouns phrases, whereas the second subsection
will describe oblique noun phrases.
8.1.1.1Caseless (Unmarked) Noun Phrases
A noun phrase is caseless (or unmarked) if it does not carry any oblique marker.","[479, 480]"
"5779.1.1.1.7“Inverse” Relative ClausesAside from the relative pronominal markers described above and the types of
ClRELs they mark, there is one last subset left. This subset was given in the last column in
Table 1 above, and it consists of -keru and -kero. The form ??-keno, also given in Table
1, is a putative form that can be arrived at by internal reconstruction, that has not been
attested in the language and, as such, that may never have existed at all. In the present
analysis only the attested singular forms (i.e. -keru and -kero) are described. The basic
facts about these markers may sound complex at first and can be best described in two
parts: First, in purely distributional terms, -keru and -kero occur attached to transitive
verbs in ClRELs containing an overt (phonologically) free argument expression that refers
to first or second person singular, or an argument encoded as a pronominal marker; and,
second, in functional terms, -keru and -kero invert the semantic roles of subject and
object when the former is encoded as first or second person singular or as a bound
pronominal marker. These descriptive facts are observable in the following examples.
First, take the simplex sentences in (24), where the subjects of both sentences are
coreferential:
O
s-V
24a. kuku n-/pu-/a-/h-atama-ta
man 1SG/3M/2SG/1PL/2PL-see-VBLZ
‘I/you(SG)/we/you(PL) saw the man.’
s-V
b. kuku apo-pe
man arrive-PFTV
‘The man has arrived.’578If the two sentences above are combined to form a complex sentence where (24a) is
embedded in (24b) as a ClREL marked with -keru, the result is the complex sentence in
(25):
S/ACTOR [undergoer-V-rel.inv
]ClREL
V
25. kuku
n-/pu-/a-/h-atama-ta-keru
apo-pe
man
1SG/2SG/1PL/2PL-see-REL.M.INV arrive-PFTV
‘The man who saw me/him/you/us/you(PL) has arrived.’
In (25) kuku is the headREL, n-/pu-/a-/h-atamatakeru ‘who saw
me/you/us/you(PL)’ is the ClREL, and apo-pe ‘has arrived’ is the verb of the matrix
clause. Note that there is NOT an error in the gloss, the bound subject pronominal forms
n-/pu-/a-/h- that encoded the actor semantic role in the simplex sentence in (24a) indeed
now encode the undergoer semantic role in the ClREL in (25); and the form kuku that
encoded an undergoer semantic role in (24b) now encodes the actor semantic role of the
ClREL in (25). Hence, my use of “S/ACTOR” (i.e. subject of the matrix clause/actor in
the ClREL) on top of kuku and of “s-“ (i.e. bound subject marker) on top of n-/pu-/a-/h- in
(25) reflects the syntactic roles that would be associated with these forms if there was not
an “inverse” ClREL pronominal marker. This inversion of the semantic roles of subject
and object (from actor to undergoer and vice-versa) is the most interesting aspect of these
relative pronominal markers, and is what has led me to refer to the type of ClRELs marked
with -keru/-kero as “inverse” ClRELs —the quotation marks being justified in the
following paragraphs.
Take now the simplex sentences in (26-27), which can be combined into complex
sentences such as those in (28):579O
S
V
26a. kuku nota/pita karota

b. suto
p-atama-ta-kero
kona apo-ka
woman
2SG-see-REL.F.INV
not
arrive-PRED
‘The woman who saw you did not arrive.’
The purpose of the examples in (28) is twofold. First, the example in (28a) shows
that the “inverse” relative pronominal markers can also be used when the argument of the
ClREL is expressed as independent pronouns for first or second person singular. So, in
(28a) kuku is the headREL, nota/pita karota-kero ‘who saw me/you’ is the ClREL, and
apo-pe the verb of the matrix clause. And, second, the examples in (28) also demonstrate
the gender distinction, also marked in “inverse” relative pronominal markers. In (28b)
suto is the feminine headREL, p-atama-ta-kero ‘who saw you’ is the ClREL taking the
580relative marker (-kero) inflected for the feminine gender to agree with the headREL suto,
and kona apoka ‘not arrive’ is the predicate of the matrix clause:
The examples in (29) are analogous to the ones above, except that the headREL
both in (29a) and in (29b) is object in the matrix clause, whereas in the previous
examples given in this section the headREL is subject in the matrix clause. The data in
(29) are given (for the sake of completeness) to demonstrate that, as is the case with the
other pronominal relative markers described in previous sections, the role of the headREL
in the matrix clause is irrelevant for the marking of “inverse” ClRELs.

The final examples of this subsection are given in (30), and they demonstrate one
of the properties mentioned above for “inverse” ClRELs: These clauses are restricted to
the ones where the overt argument is expressed by a pronominal marker or by first or
second person independent pronouns. Hence, the example in (30a) is ungrammatical
because the undergoer argument of the ClREL is a third person singular independent
nominal expression; and the one in (30b) is ungrammatical because the undergoer of the
ClREL is neither first nor second person singular:

There are two ways in that “inverse” ClRELs may be seen (under one specific
view) as reminiscent to inverse systems such as the one of North American Algonquian
languages (Foley and Van Valin 1985:296-399 and references there cited). The first is
that affixes otherwise associated with actors are associated instead with undergoers. The
second is that part of the constraints on the use of the “inverse” relative pronominal
marker is that the inverse is required when the actor is third person and the undergoer is
first or second person, partially following a person hierarchy. While the first way in
which a comparison can be made between “inverse” ClRELs and inverse systems is clear,
the second way put forth here is not so straightforward, thus requiring some further
justification below.
The “inverse” ClRELs constitute a type of restrictive clause. The semantics and
pragmatics of first and second person pronouns are such that, in most usual
circumstances, they are incompatible with those inherent to a headREL modified by a
restrictive ClREL. Since the most common function of a restrictive relative clause is to
specify, identify, restrict, etc., the meaning of the headREL, it cannot in principle modify
first or second person. It follows then that the headREL modified by a restrictive ClREL
refers, by definition, to third person, not first or second. Therefore, it follows that the
constraint on the kinds of independent pronouns that can function as undergoer of
“inverse” ClRELs plus the semantics and pragmatics inherent to restrictive ClRELs and
(exclusively) to first and second persons singular will produce only “inverse” ClRELs with
582independent subjects where 3>1,2 (i.e. third person acts on first and second persons
singular). However, at the same time that this analysis of the data can be used to justify
an analogy between “inverse” ClRELs and inverse systems in other languages, it can also
be used to understand the properties of “inverse” ClRELs as a development which is
independent and (perhaps) unrelated to true inverse systems.
An explanation, however, is still needed for why pronominal forms are among the
elements that can be the overt argument of “inverse” ClREL, and for why constraints that
apply to independent pronouns referring to first and second persons singular do not apply
to those referring to first and second persons plural. Of all the types of restrictive ClRELs
found in Apurinã, “inverse” ClRELs are the ones that require further investigation the
most. The data presented here are mostly based on the speech of one speaker and,
although, the speaker was very consistent in producing data with the same cluster of
properties given above, further verification needs to be done with more speakers, even if
only to confirm that the speech of more speakers shares such properties. It is possible,
for example, that what is described here as “inverse” ClRELs is actually the residue of
another subsystem of relativization that is pretty much out of use in the language
nowadays.
9.1.1.2Headless Relative Clauses
In all types of relative clauses described above there is a headREL that is modifiedby the ClREL. The purpose of this subsection is to show that ClRELs can also be headless,
that is, they can occur with no headREL. The pair of examples in (31) illustrates headless
ClRELs marked, respectively, with the subject and the object relative pronominal markers.
In (31a) the headless ClREL is suto oka-karu ‘who/what killed the woman’, and the
583subject is encoded solely by the subject relative pronominal marker -karu. In (31b) the
headless ClREL is a-nhika-kutu ‘what we eat’, and the object is encoded solely by the
object relative pronominal marker -kutu:

The example in (32) is illustrative of a headless ClREL where the negative form of
the subject relative pronominal marker is used. The headless ClREL is ma-ãreka-kat-inhi
‘the one who is not bad’, and the subject is encoded solely by the negative relative
subject pronominal marker -katu:

V
32. ma-ãreka-kati-nhi

In (33) the headless ClREL is n-atama-kero ‘the one who saw me’, and it is marked with
the inverse relative pronominal marker -keru:

33. p-apoka-ru
n-atama-ta-keru
2SG-find-3M.O 1SG-see-REL.M.S

In (34) the headless ClREL is nhipoko-ta-koru ‘the devoured one’, marked with the passive
relative pronominal marker -koru:
584[ V-rel.pass ]ClREL
34. nhipoko-ta-koru ...
eat-VBLZ-REL.F.PASS
‘What was devoured...’
Lit.: ‘The devoured one...’9.1.1.3Relative Clauses with Non-Verbal Predicators
In 8.4 two general types of clauses were identified in the language, verbal andnon-verbal. For all ClRELs described above the clauses are verbal rather than non-verbal.
This subsection describes ClRELs with non-verbal predicators. Simplex sentences
constituted of non-verbal predicators may consist of the juxtaposition of word forms, and
they can only encode states (as seen in 8.4.2). A non-verbal clause can occur inside a
complex sentence where one NP (from the non-verbal clause) is interpreted as the
headREL that is modified by another NP (also from the non-verbal clause) functioning as a
ClREL. So, in (35a), the nominal form popũka-ro ‘Apurinã-F’ works as a nominal
predicator modifying suto ‘woman’, and in (35b) suto-nhi ‘woman-AFFECT’ works as
the nominal predicator that modifies amarunu ‘child’: 3

boundaries are nowadays opaque in some speech varieties, and the word is used to mean as a hybrid now to mean
‘child’, interpretable as masculine or feminine.","[608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616]"

start or completion. This is what, for lack of a better term, is being called here the
imminent aspect, which is marked with the class2 bound form -napano (morphologically
described in 5.2.1.2.1.3). The most approximate English translation of -napano would be
‘about to’ or, in some cases, ‘nearly’. Examples illustrating the imminent marker are
given in (105):
s-V-IMMIN
105a. n-umaka-napano
1SG-sleep-IMMIN
‘I’m about to sleep.’
s-V-IMMIN-PFTV
b. nhi-nhipoko-ta-napano-pe-ka
1SG-eat-VBLZ-IMMIN-PFTV-PRED
‘I’m already about to eat’
s-V-IMMIN-IMPFTV
c. nhi-nhipoko-ta-napano-panhi-ka
1SG-eat-VBLZ-IMMIN-IMPFTV-PRED
‘I’m still about to eat.’
527In (105a) the event described by the clause is that the speaker is ‘about to fall asleep’. In
(105b) the imminent marker -napano combines with the perfective marker -pe in the verb
to mark in the predicate the sense of ‘already being about to eat’. As the example in
(105b) illustrates, when the imminent marker is combined with the perfective marker,
completive perfectivity is canceled out, changing into an
“emphatic/highlighting/underscoring” marker of situations about to come into being. In
(105c) the imminent marker combines with the incompletive -panhi to describe a state
that ‘still is about to come into being’. As this last example illustrates, when imminent
and incompletive markers are combined the result is that again the ‘state of about to come
into being’ is “emphasized/highlighted/underscored”. However, the difference of the
imminent + completive versus imminent + incompletive combination is in terms of the
perspective imposed on the ‘“imminence” of what is come into being’: So, while for
(105b) the perspective is that the event ‘will come into being’ sooner rather than later, for
(105c) there is the invited inference that the event ‘will come into being’ later rather than
sooner. This invited inference explains why (105c) may also be translated as ‘It still will
take me some time before eating’.
The combination of imminent + completive and imminent + incompletive can
also be described, conversely, from the point of view of the (in)completive marker. The
presence of the completive marker with the imminent form in the verb changes the
unmarked pragmatic meaning of the latter. The use of the imminent marker carries with
it the invited inference that the event ‘will come into being’. While the presence of the
completive marker along with the imminent form reinforces this inference, the presence
of the incompletive marker along with the imminent cancels out the invited inference.
Although the cancellation of this invited inference can be accomplished with the
528imminent + incompletive combination, there also is in the language another
morphological form whose primary pragmatic function is precisely to impose the
opposite invited inference on the predicate, as described in the next subsection.
8.6.2.2.5Anti-PerfectiveThe last type of imperfectivity marker found in the language is -wari ‘almost’,
which, as the gloss suggests, occurs when a situation stops close to beginning or
completing. Since this imperfectivity marker blocks a situation from beginning or
completing (and also for the lack of a better term), I refer to -wari as a marker of an antiperfective aspect. In (106a) the situation reported is about ‘the near death of somebody’.
In (106b) the event is about ‘the speaker nearly getting bitten by a snake’. (106b) shows
the anti-perfective marker in a state about ‘the temperature being almost too hot’:
s-V-APFTV
106a. Ø-upũpe-wari-ta
3M-die-APFTV
‘He almost died.’
S
V-APFTV-o
b. kaikiripi akatsa-wari-ta-no
surucucu bite-APFTV-VBLZ-1SG.O
‘The “surucucu” snake almost bit me.’
V-APFTV-o
c. ka-pataka-powa-wari-ru
ATTR-be.hot-AUGM-APFTV-3M.O
‘It’s almost too hot.’
When only events are considered (i.e. disregarding descriptive verbs), the
imminent and the anti-perfective are semantically similar insofar as both have the general
property of marking a situation approaching a start or completion. They are different,
however, as to the perspective they impose on events that can be objectively described as
529identical in the real world. When the imminent aspect is used, the interpretation tends to
be one where the event is more likely than not to begin or reach a completion. When the
anti-perfective is used, the interpretation tends to be one where the event is more likely
than not to not have begun or completed. Compare for example the example in (107) to
that in (105a):
s-V-APFTV
107. n-umaka-wari-ta
1SG-sleep-APFTV-VBLZ
‘I almost slept.’
The default interpretation for (105a) is that the speaker will sleep, whereas the opposite
interpretation is the default one for (107). Further, while both sentences can be
interpreted as expressing present and past events, (105a) but not (107) can be interpreted
as expressing an event that takes place in the immediate future. More than that, in
pragmatic terms, it is common to use the imminent (but not anti-perfective) marker in the
present. Although anti-perfective can be used in the present, it is less commonly used in
such a way. It is due to these semantic and pragmatic reasons that imminent and antiperfective markers carry with them opposite invited inferences: While the former invites
a positive inference that the event will begin or complete, the latter invites the negative
inference that the event will not begin or complete.","[557, 558, 559, 560, 561]"
"6.7.1Adverbial Particles
Certain particles have meanings that include time, manner, degree, spatial deixis, thussemantic properties reminiscent to certain adverbs in European languages. These particles are
here called adverbial particles, a label which will be more properly justified as some of the
distributional properties of these particles are presented below. Time (or temporal) expressions
refer to parts of a day, and to shorter or longer periods in the life of a person or group of persons.
The following table lists the adverbial particles currently attested:367Table 6: Adverbial Temporal Particles

‘First, he came.’
d. kuta
nu-sa-ru
yesterday 1SG-go-3M.O
‘I left yesterday.’
e. and so on.
As illustrated by watxa ‘today, now’ in the examples in (31), adverbial particles have a
“loose” distribution within the clause, with no formal marking or semantic consequences:
31a. watxa nu-su-pe-ka
today 1SG-go-PFTV-PRED
‘I’ll leave now.’
b. nu-su-pe-ka
watxa
1SG-go-PFTV-PRED today
‘I’ll leaving now.’
368There is one reasonably clear case of manner adverbial particle in the language, which
is the form arĩkika ‘slowly.’ As shown in (32), ari%kika, can occur before (32a) or after (32b) the
modified predicate:
kuku
apo-pe
32a. arĩkika sãki-rewa-ta-karu
slowly speak-INTR-VBLZ-RELZ man
arrive-PFTV
‘‘The man who speaks slowly arrived.’
b. sãki-rewa-ta-karu
kuku apo-pe
arĩkika
speak-INTR-VBLZ-RELZ man
arrive-PFTV slowly
‘‘The man who speaks arrived slowly.’
Notice in the examples above that the manner adverb, in both instances, modifies the meaning of
the predicate adjacent to it.
Some meanings that are associated with adverbs in European languages (insofar as they
refer to the intensity of an event/state, the degree to which or the manner in which it takes place)
are expressed by bound forms in the verb in Apurinã. Examples of these are –ka
‘INTENSIFIER’, -wari ‘almost’, and -ãpo ‘RANDOM’ (described under 5.2.1.1). Other
adverb-like meanings are expressed as verbal constructions, such that, in terms of their
translation equivalents, instead of saying ‘He runs rapidly.’ one would say ‘He’s fast.’
Other semantically adverb-like particles include a pair of spatial forms used with deictic
functions. Analogous to the demonstratives, these spatial adverbial forms can be distal, i.e. far
from the speaker (or other deictic center), or proximate, i.e. close to the speaker/hearer (or other
deictic center), as listed in the following Table 7:
Table 7: Adverbial Spatial Particles
Gloss
‘here’
‘there’Forms
wai
werã
369The examples in (33) illustrate the use of distal and proximate adverbial particles:
33a. n-awa-ru
wai
1SG-exist-3M.O here
‘I live here.’
b. nu-sa-ru
werã
1SG-go-3M.O there
‘He went there.’
One important information related to the approximate adverbial particle wai is that there
is a phonologically identical form that can be used as a descriptive verb. So, the conventional
way to greet a person when visiting an Apurinã village is by uttering (34a), for which (34b) is the
conventional answer:
34a. wai-ka-i
pite
be.here-PRED-2O 2SG
‘Hi there…!’
Lit.: ‘Are you here?’
b. wai-ka-ra-no
nota
be.here-PRED-FOC-2O 1SG
‘Hi, I’m here!’
Lit.: ‘It’s here that I am!’
Both in (34a) and (34b) the form wai is used as a descriptive objective verb which takes the
object pronominal marker to express its notional subject. There are two possible analyses of
these examples as far as the form wai is concerned. The basic question is whether the proximate
adverbial particle and the object descriptive verb are different words or whether they actually are
the same word, namely a proximate adverbial particle that can be used (as other words can) as
the predicate of a “verbless” clause. In this work I will treat wai used in an object descriptive
predicate as a descriptive objective verb, and wai used with an adverbial-like function as an
370adverbial particle. It is conceivable, however, that this is ultimately a purely terminological
issue.
Another terminological issue is whether adverbial particles should not be described as an
independent word class equivalent to the word class adverbs in European languages. The reason
I have included adverbials as a subclass of particles rather than as an independent word class is
that adverbs, like other particles, share the property of lacking any inherent morphological
property. Ultimately, this may be another simple matter of terminology which is immaterial to
the description of the language.","[398, 399, 400, 401, 402]"

have already seen i-ye being described in Table 3 as the masculine demonstrative form. The
immediate question that arises is whether the discourse particle and the demonstrative are just
different functions of the same morpheme, or whether they are actually different morphemes.
There are reasons to say that the latter alternative better describes iye. That is, it would appear
that the discourse particle iye is already a lexically distinct word. The main evidence for this is
the fact that iye but not *oye (the feminine demonstrative counterpart) can be used as a discourse
particle. Similar reasoning applies to aru2 in relation to the positive polarity marker aru1.
Discourse particles are the sort of words that are generally not offered by speakers in
elicited material and which they usually find difficult to translate into Portuguese. These same
particles, however, are pervasive in natural (non-elicited) discourse, and they usually occur
preceded as well as followed by short pauses. The proper analysis of discourse particles requires
knowledge about the organization of discourse structures, something beyond the scope of this
work. The examples in (36) illustrate the usage of some of the discourse particles:

Although further investigation is required on the syntactic functions and distribution of the
words described here as particles, it is possible to say that at least some of them present
properties distinct from those of other closed word classes. Other particles may turn out to be
better described as part of a subclass of other closed (or even open) word classes. This, however,
can only be determined on the basis of further research.","[403, 404, 405]"
"283The verbs listed in the Table 2, however, are restricted to non-derived objective
descriptive verbs. As will be shown in section 5.3, the attributive markers pa- and kacan attach to root forms to derive objective descriptive verbs. Although a more
systematic study of the lexical semantics of objective descriptive verbs is required, I
should say that the semantic fields involved in derived objective descriptive verbs only
widens the range of properties referred to by objective descriptive verbs in general.
Finally, some of the verb forms listed in the Table 2 are the positive values of a
property; for these verbs, their negative values (i.e. their antonyms) are expressed as a
negation of the positive value. So, for example, the opposite of the verb hareka ‘be
good’ is kona hareka ‘be bad (not be good)’.
5.1.1.2 Transitive Verbs
Transitive (or bivalent) verbs differ morphologically from the general class of
intransitive ones insofar as only the transitive verbs can take both subject and object
pronominal markers. Transitive verbs are syntactically different from intransitive verbs
precisely in that only the former require the presence of both subject and object
simultaneously. Transitive verbs can be divided into regular transitive verbs and
(potentially) ditransitive verbs on the basis of whether their object can be marked by an
oblique marker or not. The example given in (4b) was an instance of a transitive verb.
Other examples are as given in (14), where nhi-, n- and nu- are subject pronominal
markers, and -ru is an object pronominal marker:
14a. nhi-nhika-ãpo-ta-ru
1SG-eat-RANDOM-VLBZ-3M.O
‘I went around aimlessly eating it.’284b. n-oka-ma-ru-ko
1SG-kill-FRUSTR-3M-FUT
‘I would have killed it.’
c. nu-taka-pe-ta-ru
1SG-put-pulp-VBLZ-3M.O
‘I put it (the fleshy thing) away.’
Solely in terms of their morphology, there is no basis for distinguishing bivalent
verbs from potentially trivalent verbs in Apurinã. The recipient argument of a potentially
trivalent verb can also be marked with object pronominal markers. So, the morphemes
-ru and -ro of the examples in (15) express the recipient of suka ‘give’:
15a. pu-suka-ru
2SG-give-3M.O‘Give (something) to him.’b. pu-suka-ro
2SG-give-3F.O‘Give (something) to her.’However, there are other types of differences between transitive and ditransitive
verb worth of note. In the next subsections I will describe properties indicating that both
regular transitive and ditransitive verbs can be analyzed as subclasses of transitive verbs,
under the definition of transitive verbs provided above. In distinguishing regular
transitive verbs from ditransitive verbs I will make use of the structural constituency
notion of “noun phrase”, which will be properly motivated later in chapter 8. For the
moment, “noun phrase” can be informally defined as the (pro)nominal free syntactic
expressions that are used to bear grammatical relations to the clausal predicator.
5.1.1.2.1Regular Transitive VerbsRegular transitive verbs are the most typical transitive verbs in the language,
insofar as they require both a (grammatical) subject and a (grammatical) object, wherein
285subject and object can be expressed as noun phrases, as a combination of noun phrases
plus the corresponding subject/object pronominal marker in the verb, or just as subject
and object pronominal markers. Regular transitive verbs constitute by far the great
majority of transitive verbs found in the language. In the following examples in (16)
(where underlining marks co-reference between the relevant arguments), the
(pro)nominal forms aõtu ‘umari fruit’, uwa ‘3SG.M’, maku ‘Brazil-nut’, and komeru-pe
‘manioc-pulp’ are all grammatical objects in the clauses they occur in; in (16d) the
subject is formally expressed as the pronominal marker a- ‘1PL’; and in (16e) both
subject and object are only manifested, respectively, as the pronominal markers a- and
-ru:
aõtu
16a. hãtako-ro apa-nanu-ta-ru
girl.F
fetch-PROG-VBLZ-3M.O umari(M)
‘The girl is fetching “umari” (fruit).’
b. o-atamata-ru uwa

3F-look-3M.O 3SG.M woman
‘The woman, she looked at it/him.’
c. maku

Brazil.nut we fetch
‘We gather Brazil-nut’
d. a-makatxaka txa-ru

1PL-take.out AUX-3M.O manioc-pulp
‘We take the manioc pulp out.’
e. a-makatxaka-ru
1PL-take.out-3M.O
‘We take it out.’
In the examples in (16) subject/object pronominal markers are only found in the verb
when the subject/object NP is either post-verbal or absent in the clause. I will discuss in286further detail the correlation between post-verbal subject/object noun phrases and
subject/object markers in the next chapter, in 8.1.1.
5.1.1.2.2Potentially Ditransitive VerbsVerbs that translate as ditransitive (i.e. trivalent) verbs in other languages behave
like regular transitive verbs in Apurinã insofar as only the subject and one object are
structurally required to occur, and the third argument is structurally optional (i.e. the third
argument can be omitted without making the clause ungrammatical). The examples in
(17) illustrate the general case, namely that verbs that translate as ditransitive verbs in
some other languages, in this case as ‘to teach’ and as ‘to tell’ in English, behave as
regular transitive verbs in Apurinã (parentheses indicate that the expression is structurally
optional in the clause in which it occurs):
u-sãkire
(pita-monhi)
17a. mipake owara-pira-ta-ru
Mipake teach-language-3M.O 3M-language.of 2SG-GOAL
‘Mipake taught his language (to you).’
b. nota sãpire-ta-ru
tsora sãkire
(youkake-monhi)
1SG tell-VBLZ-3M.O Tsora language.of Youkake-GOAL
‘I told the Tsora story (to Youkake).’As shown in (17), the argument expressing the “theme” is obligatory and occurs as the
object of the verb, expressed by a “caseless” noun phrase, while the recipient argument is
optionally expressed by an “oblique” noun phrase. For the present purposes of this
section, a “caseless” noun phrase can be informally defined as a noun phrase without any
morphological case marker, whereas an “oblique” noun phrase can be described (also
informally) as a noun phrase marked with an oblique (case) marker. The description of
noun phrases will take place under 9.3.
287There is one ditransitive verb, i.e. suka ‘to give (away)’, however, that differs
from regular transitive verbs in two main ways. There are two special properties to be
noted about the Apurinã verb suka that make it a special case of transitive verb: The first
property is that only this ditransitive verb allows a third argument (representing the
recipient) to be expressed by a caseless noun phrase. So, for example, in (18) a
comparison is made between the verb for suka and etuka ‘to look’, where the former is
the special case of a transitive verb (i.e. a potentially ditransitive transitive verb) and the
latter is the typical case of transitive verbs (i.e. a regular transitive verb) in Apurinã:
18a. nhi-yowata-ne
pita nota suka
1SG-knife-POSSED 2SG 1SG give
‘I gave you my knife.’
b. *i-yowata-ne
pita nota etuka
2M-knife-POSSED 2SG 1SG look
(I watched/looked over his knife for him.)
In (18a), where pita ‘2SG’ and nhi-yowata-ne (1SG-knife-POSSED) ‘my knife’ are,
respectively, recipient and “theme” arguments, both (recipient and “theme”) arguments
are expressed by noun phrases, whereas (18b) is ungrammatical.
The second special property of suka is that, while regular transitive verbs take a
single caseless object noun phrase, with suka either the “theme” argument, represented by
a “caseless” noun phrase, or the recipient argument, expressed by an oblique noun phrase,
can bear the object grammatical relation, as indicated by what the object pronominal
marker agrees with, as the examples in (19) illustrate:
19a. o-suka-ro
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
3F-give-3F.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘She gave my arrow to him.’
288b. nota suka-ru
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
1SG give-3M.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘I gave my arrow to him.’
In (19a), the verb bears a feminine object pronominal marker, agreeing with the caseless
noun phrase representing the “theme” argument nu-serepi ‘my arrow’. In (19b), in
contrast, the verb bears a masculine pronominal marker, agreeing with the recipient
object, which is expressed by the oblique noun phrase uwa-mokaru ‘to him’
(morphologically described in chapter 7, 7.1.2.4). That is, insofar as pronominal object
markers can be considered to be the major formal marking property of the object
grammatical relation in Apurinã, the object of the ditransitive verb suka can be expressed
either by the caseless noun phrase representing the “theme” or by the oblique (or
caseless) noun phrase expressing the recipient. In the interest of focusing here on the
properties that regular transitive and ditransitive verbs share or do not share, I will
postpone to chapter 8 (in subsection 8.1.1.2, where the relevant type of grammatical
relations will be presented) further discussion on what it means for the recipient or the
“theme” semantic role to be marked as object in the language. General constraints on the
structure of clauses with potentially ditransitive verbs will be discussed in 8.3.
In sum, the examples in (18-19) show that the ditransitive verb suka differs from
regular transitive verbs in two ways: First, only this ditransitive verb allows for a
recipient argument to be expressed as a caseless noun phrase; and, second, the object of
this ditransitive verb denoting the recipient can be expressed either by a caseless noun
phrase or by an oblique noun phrase. On the basis of the distinctions just described, one
might feel motivated to postulate that transitive regular verbs and ditransitive verbs
constitute distinct general syntactic types of verbs, types that would be as different from
289one another as are intransitive and regular transitive verbs. There are, however, two
important reasons to analyze ditransitive verbs as a subclass of transitive verbs in
Apurinã. The two examples in (20) have in common the fact that only two arguments of
the verb are overtly realized in the clause: In (20a) nota ‘1SG’ is the object, since it is
coreferential with the object pronominal marker -no ‘1SG.O’, and in (20b) the only
formal manifestation of the object is the object pronominal marker -ru ‘3M.O’:
nota
20a. pu-suka-no
2SG-give-1SG.O 1SG
‘Give away to me.’
b. nu-suka-pe-ka-ru
1SG-give-PFTV-PRED-3M.O
‘I’ve given away to him.’
Examples such as those in (20) reflect a common property of ditransitive verbs,
namely that they only require two arguments to be (morpho)syntactically realized in the
clause, the subject and the (recipient) object; that is, they are only “potentially”
ditransitive. The examples in (20) also confirm what was already illustrated by the
examples in (19) (and underscored in chapter 5, in subsection 5.1.12). Only one nonsubject argument of ditransitive verbs is required in a clause, and, moreover, only one of
the non-subject arguments can be coreferential with the object pronominal marker in the
verb. Thus, insofar as ditransitive verbs require only two arguments and insofar as the
free standing expression that can be in an object relation (whether a “caseless” noun
phrase or an “oblique” noun phrase in post-verbal position) can be coreferential with the
same pronominal object markers in the verb as those that attach to regular transitive
verbs, they can be considered to belong to the same general category as regular transitive
verbs.
290Aside from the verb suka ‘to give’, there is only one other verb, namely, sukare
‘sell’, that appears to allow the recipient to be expressed either as a “caseless” noun
phrase or as an “oblique” noun phrase, as illustrated in (21).
21a. aiko mipake sukare-pe-ro
suto
house Mipake sell-PFTV-3F.O woman
‘Mipake sold the house to the woman.’
b. mipa sukare-pe-ru
aiko
mipa-mokaru
Mipa sell-PFTV-3M.O house(M)-AFFECT woman(M)-GOAL
‘Mipa sold the house to the woman’However, the verb sukare requires further verification, since the data available still do not
allow a conclusive analysis about the formal marking of its argument roles. Although it
is clear in (21a) that the verb sukare can take a third caseless noun phrase argument, the
example in (21b) is ambiguous as to whether the pronominal object marker is
coreferential with the caseless noun phrase argument aiko ‘house’ or with the “oblique”
noun phrase argument mipa-mokaru (since both contain a masculine noun). One of the
problems with sukare is that it expresses a concept that has been fairly recently
introduced into some of the Apurinã communities, and, as such, it is not consistently used
across large numbers of speakers or across speech varieties. As will be seen in
5.2.1.1.1.3, some speakers simply add the intransitivizer -rewa to the verb suka in order
to express the concept ‘to sell’. It is likely that the form sukare is a lexicalized form that
resulted from the reduction of suka-rewa-ta into sukare, going through some process of
reanalysis that still needs to be determined. In terms of their most general use, although
verbs such as suka and sukare can take both a “theme” and a recipient argument, these
verbs are most often found with only one of these two arguments morphosyntactically
291expressed —exactly as expected from a transitive verb. Issues related to when the object
of a ditransitive verb stands as a “caseless” noun phrase or as an “oblique” noun phrase
will be addressed in chapter 8, in subsection 8.1.1.2. Some restrictions apply to the
clausal distribution of the noun phrases bearing an object grammatical relation; such
restrictions will be described later in 8.3.
5.1.1.3 Presentational Verb
Constructions used to introduce a participant in the discourse generally make use
of the verb awa. In its presentational use awa translates as ‘there be’, as indicated by the
following examples. In the examples in (22) the nominal forms i-ye sãko ‘this “traíra”
fish’, nhiki-txi ‘game (meat of hunted animal)’, and yowata ‘knife’ occur as arguments of
the presentational verb:
22a. sãko awa?
traíra there.be
‘There is “traíra” fish.’
b. nhikitxi awa-ka-sawaku
game
there.be-PRED-TEMP
‘When there’s game…’
c. apoka-koru yowata awa
find-REL
knife
there.be
‘There’s a knife that was found.’
Although the presence of the third person object marker -ru in (22a) would seem
to suggest that awa takes an object argument, there are other syntactic properties
associated to this verb which still need to be better understood. As the examples in
(22a,c) show, the presence of the pronominal marker in the verb is not a obligatory. The
exact nature of the syntactic arguments of awa and the factor(s) that determine(s) the
292presence (or absence) of the pronominal marker in the verb are issues which are still
unresolved. The reason for this is partly because I have not done yet a careful survey of
the syntactic consequences of the (sub-)meanings of awa. For the purpose of this work, I
will simply list these (sub-)meanings here and leave for further research the decision as to
whether they reflect semantic properties of different (but homophonous) lexical entries or
whether they constitute semantic sub-variants of one and the same lexical entry. In
addition to introducing presentational constructions, the verb form awa can also be used
as a main verb with the meanings described and illustrated in the next paragraphs:
awa used with a sort of existential meaning, i.e. ‘to exist, live’, as in (23):23a. popũka-ru-wakoru awa-ru
Apurinã-M-PL.M
there.be-3M.O
‘Apurinã existed.’
b. kone kariwa
awa-ru
not
white.person there.be-3M.O
‘White people didn’t exist.’
c. aiko kone watxa awa-yoka
house NEG today there.be-NO.LONGER
‘The house no longer exists nowadays.’
It is true that there is a clear overlap between the existential meaning of awa, as
illustrated by the examples in (23), and its presentational meaning, as illustrated by the
examples in (22). In both the presentational and existential scenarios in which awa is
used, the verb predicates about the types of existences of what is referred to by its
argument. A very subtle difference is that in the cases illustrated in (23) the predication
is about a longer (more permanent or stable) existence during states or processes, whereas293in (22) the predication is about a shorter (more short-lived, momentary, accidental, or
casual) existence during states or processes.
awa used with locative meaning, i.e. ‘to live in, inhabit, reside’, to refer to inhabitancy or
other place circumstances, as in (24):24a. nu-wãka-tu-kata
1SG-namesake-big-ASSOC
‘I live with my namesake.’n-awa
1SG-there.beb. nha-monhi-pa
p-awa-ru
WH-GOAL-INT 2SG-there.be-3M.O
‘Where do you live?´
c. aiko here-ri-nhi

‘The cute house where the woman lives in collapsed.’
d. uwã-ra
ata wai awa-pe-ru
PTC-ESS 1PL here there.be-PFTV-3M.O
‘Then we stay here.’
awa used with possessive meaning, i.e. ‘to have’, as in (25):
25a. nha-pakunu-pa p-ãtenekoru p-awa
WH-plus-INT
2SG-children 2SG-there.be
‘How many children do you have?’
b. n-awa-ru
epi kanawa
1SG-have-3M.O two canoe
‘I have two canoes.’5.1.1.4 Auxiliary
The auxiliary verb txa is used with verbal predicates, following the verb and
serving as the “host” base for some of the material the main verb inflects for, as the294examples in (26) illustrate. In (26a) the auxiliary follows the verb akirita ‘to call’ and
takes the object pronominal marker; in (26b), the auxiliary follows the verb atama ‘to
look’ and takes the object pronominal marker; in (26c) the auxiliary follows the verb
form yotika-xiti-ka-ta ‘burn-field-INTENS-VBLZ’ and takes no pronominal marker; and,
in (26d) the auxiliary follows the objective descriptive verb form hareka-ko ‘be.goodFUT’:
26a. akirita i-txa-ro
owa
call
3M-AUX-3F 3SG.F
‘He called her.’
b. pitxeka i-txa
komeru
grow 3M-AUX manioc
‘The manioc grew.’
c. ata yotika-xiti-ka-ta
txa
1PL burn-earth-INTENS-VBLZ AUX
‘We burn well the farm field.’
d. hareka-ko
pi-txa
be.good-FUT 2SG-AUX
‘Be good.’
The form txa behaves as an auxiliary verb in that it adds no meaning to the
proposition expressed by the clause in which it occurs, and it usually carries part of the
bound formatives that would otherwise attach to the lexical verb form. txa is rarely found
in elicited material offered by Apurinã speaker as translations of Portuguese data, but it is
very commonly found in text material. Presently I have not found any grammatical or
semantic factor that determines when txa is used or not, nor have I been able to find any
grammatical or semantic motivation for when a bound formative will attach to the
auxiliary rather than to the lexical verb. Except for rare instances, the subject and/or
pronominal markers will attach to the auxiliary form when this auxiliary is present in the
295same clause. However, other bound formatives are more often found attached to the
lexical base rather than to the auxiliary.
The form txa can also be used as a main verb with various meanings, as described
and illustrated in the next paragraphs:
txa can be used to mean ‘to speak, to say’ introducing (or not) a direct or an indirect
quotation. This is the most common use of txa as a main verb attested in texts and is
illustrated in the following examples. In the first two examples below, (27a, b), txa
introduces direct quotations; in (27c) txa introduces an indirect quotation; and in (27d)
txa simply takes an object:
27a. kuku-ka-ne-ra-no
i-txa
man-PRED-ALSO-FOC-1SG.O 3M-say
‘He said “It’s a man that I also am.”’
b. Ø-oka-pe-no-na-ko
i-txa
kema owa-mokaru
3M-kill-PFTV-PL-FUT 3M-say tapir 3SG.F-GOAL
‘“They’ll kill me”, the tapir said to the woman.’
c. kuku-ka-ne-ra
uwa
o-txa-ru
man-PRED-ALSO-FOC 3SG.M 3F-say-3M.O
‘She said that he’s also a man.’
d. akirita i-txa-ro
owa
call
3M-say-3F.O 3SG.F
‘He called her.’
txa can be used as a copula verb to mean ‘to be’, as seen in (28), in which case the
reflexive marker -wa is also found in the verb:
28a. owa-kanera
suto
o-txa-wa
3SG.F-ALSO woman 3SG.F-be-REFL
‘She is also a woman.’296b. uwa-kanera
kuku i-txa-wa
3SG.M-ALSO man 3SG.M-be-REFL
‘He is also a man.’
Finally, txa can also be used to make reference to the lexical meaning of another verb
(normally found in the preceding discourse). It can be roughly translated as ‘do’, as
shown next:29a. a-txa-ru
ata kitxekapirĩka
1PL-do-3M.O 1PL formerly
‘We did it in ancient times.’
b. i-txa-ka-ta-ru
3M-do-INTENS-VBLZ-3M.O
‘He really did it.’5.1.2 Verbs with Incorporated Nouns
Verbs can incorporate a noun form which occurs adjacent to the verb root. So far
I have only attested incorporated nouns with transitive verbs. The incorporated noun
form can either be a regular noun (i.e. non-classificatory inalienable nouns and/or
alienable nouns) or a classificatory noun. As happens to any other forms that occur as
part of the morphological structure of the verb, incorporated nouns need to obey the
morphological rules for placement inside the verb. What this means is that incorporated
nouns also have one (and only one) slot in which they occur inside the verb and, for
reasons to be explained under 5.2.1.1, the presence of an incorporated noun in the verb
requires the presence of the verbalizer -ta (described under 5.2.1.1). The simplest
structure of a verb with an incorporated noun can be represented as in (30), where the slot
for the incorporated noun is the first position immediately after the first root in the verb,
297as represented by the underlined space: (Recall that BRt=Bound Root and FRt=Free
Root.)
BRt
30. V → FRt  + __ + ta
5.1.2.1 Verbs with Incorporated Regular Nouns
Verbs with incorporated regular nouns are verb forms that incorporate a noun
which expresses a semantic argument of the verb inside which it occurs. That is, certain
nouns when used as a syntactic unit expressing the argument of a verb can also occur
incorporated in the verb and still have the same semantic function as non-incorporated
nouns. This is illustrated in the examples in (31) and (32). In (31a), tapo-txi ‘arrow’
occurs non-incorporated as a syntactic unit expressing the notional object of the verb.
The same noun form occurs incorporated in (31b), also expressing the notional object of
the verb. The examples in (32) follow an analogous pattern, except that in (32a) the nonincorporated noun is possessed whereas in (32b) it is unpossessed —i.e. marked with the
unpossessor marker -txi:
pu-suka-ta-no
31a. tapo-txi
bow-UNPOSS 2SG-give-VBLZ-1SG.O‘Give me a bow.’b. pu-suka-tapo-ta-no
3F.S 2SG-give-food-VBLZ-1SG.O‘Give me a bow.’32a. nota pu-suka-ta-no
pu-tou
1SG 2SG-give-VBLZ-3M.O 2SG-thing‘Give me your goods.’b. pu-suka-toi-txi-ta-no
2SG-give-thing-UNPOSS-VBLZ-1SG.O‘Give me the goods.’298The semantic propositions expressed in (31a-b) are exactly the same, since in both
examples the incorporated and non-incorporated nominal elements express the “theme”
semantic role of the verb. However, syntactically the incorporated noun constitutes part
of a compound verb base within which it (the noun) plays no syntactic role, whereas the
possessor agrees with the pronominal object marker found in the verb, as do nominals in
object relation to the verb.
In the next pair of examples in (33), the nominal form yãkunu ‘footprint.of’
occurs non-incorporated in (33a) and incorporated in (33b):
33a. n-atama-ta ru-na
kema yãkunu
1SG-look-VBLZ-3M.O tapir footprint.of
‘I looked at the tapir’s footprint.’
b. n-atama-yãkunu-ta-ru
kema
1SG-look-footprint.of-VBLZ-3M.O tapir
‘I looked at the tapir’s footprint.’
The semantic interpretations of (33a-b) are the same, since in both cases yãkunu,
incorporated or not, is the possessed element in the clause. Here, again, the incorporated
element plays no syntactic function and the possessor element is cross-referenced by the
object marker in the verb. Therefore, the analysis of these incorporated nominal elements
can be described as a result of possessor raising where the possessor element acquires
syntactic properties of the syntactic object of the verb. The types of verb incorporated
regular nouns given above are not intended to exhaust all the types of regular noun
incorporation in the language. Instead, they simply illustrate the presence in the language
of regular noun incorporation, which can be contrasted with the classificatory noun
incorporation.","[314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]"
"6.7.5 Hortative Particle
The hortative particle can be realized as (h)amo or am-, depending on a combination of
speech variety in the first case, or on rate of speech, in the second case. As the label suggests,
hortative is used to incite or invite someone to do something, as shown by the examples in (37).
I will say more on hortative marking in chapter 8, in 8.8.3.1, when presenting the clause it occurs
within as speech act.
a-su-pe
37a. hamo
HORT 1PL-go-PFTV

b. hamo a-kako-rewa-ta
HORT 1PL-chew.katsoparu-INTR-VBLZ
‘Let’s do “katsoparu” chewing.’
3746.8 Final Remarks
As is clear from the list of words belonging to the closed classes presented in this chapter,
only a limited set of grammatical functions can be expressed in Apurinã by means of such
independent words. This follows as a natural consequence of the wide range of grammatical
functions expressed by bound formatives in the language, as the ones described in chapters 3-5
and the ones that will be described in the next chapter. Moreover, although closed word classes
such as independent pronouns, in general, possess no inherent morphological properties formally
marked (i.e., with very few exceptions such as the 3rd person plural marker -na, they are not
generally segmentable into class-specific morphemes in the same way as nouns and verbs are).
Finally, I will return to some of the closed classes or words in chapters 8-9, where the syntax of
simplex sentences is described. As happens in various other places in this work, certain word
properties can be better described within the specific domains of the grammar that these
properties are most relevant to. This applies most clearly to the interrogative words and to the
majority of the particles introduced above. In fact, even more than syntactic structures, discourse
particles require information about the organization of the Apurinã discourse structure in order to
be properly described. Since this work does not include a description of discourse structures,
discourse particles cannot (unfortunately) be satisfactorily described here.","[405, 406]"
"612Chapter 10Concluding Remarks
In this work I have presented a somewhat typologically informed grammatical
description of the Apurinã language. In the first chapter the socio-cultural context where
the language is spoken was summarized. The group of Apurinã speakers is nowadays
mainly made of elders, and few of the children are learning the language. These
characteristics, in addition to the others described in the first chapter, place Apurinã
among the endangered languages of the Amazon region of Brazil.
As seen in chapter 2, the segmental phonology of the language is organized in
relatively simple terms. The language has a (C)(V)V syllable template and its
morphophonological alternations are restricted to the subject/possessor markers and a few
other bound morphemes. Stress is mostly predictably penultimate, although sensitive to
syllable weight —as determined by nasality and lengthening. Further research needs to
be done in order to explain the exceptions to the general patterns described in chapter 2,
especially with respect to the possibility of the same word form to vary in its primary
stress position. Only a tentative analysis was presented on intonation in Apurinã; more
research is necessary in the prosodic structure of the language.
Perhaps to compensate for the simplicity of the phonological system of the
language, its morphology is extremely rich. Bound morphemes abound in the language,
especially in the verb, with a great variety of functions. Due to this typological
characteristic of this language with respect to its morphological system, five chapters (36137) were spent describing, respectively, a general introduction to morphology, the noun
morphology, verb morphology, closed word class morphology, and special bound
morphology. It is this richness in morphological forms and their specific functions that
give Apurinã characteristics associated with so-called polysynthetic languages. Nouns
and verbs can be independently motivated as distinct parts-of-speech on morphological as
well as syntactic grounds. Adverbial and adjectival meanings, on the other hand, have
their typical functions expressed by means of bound morphemes or particles, in the first
case, and, in the second case, by bound morphemes, classificatory nouns and descriptive
verbs. Special bound morphemes are less than typical affix forms that can be classified
as floating, quasi-floating, or non-floating in terms of whether they occur with different
word categories or not. Aside from the floating characteristics of bound morphemes they
show the common property of occurring as the “outer”-most layers of bound morphemes
in their word bases. Moreover, some of them interact in special ways with syntactic
phenomena as, for example, the complementary distribution that is found between
subject/object pronominal markers and coreferential pre-verbal subject/object
expressions, or subject/possessor markers and free coreferential possessor expressions.
These particular properties of special bound formatives are comparable to properties
associated with independent words, thus making them behave as clitic-like forms. On the
other hand, the fixed linear position of special bound formatives is a property they share
with the more typical affixes found in the language.
Two features of the morphosyntax of the language can be considered somewhat
particular. First, certain inalienable noun forms are productively used as part of
compound nouns in ways reminiscent to numeral classifiers. Such nouns are used with
classificatory functions to refer to (or impose) semantic features related to the shape and
614consistency of the referent expressed by the compound noun. Not only that, these
classificatory nouns can also occur incorporated in the verb and, in this position, be used
with anaphoric-like functions. Second, the bound formatives can be seen as organized in
hierarchical “layers” that are motivated by the distribution of distinct sets of these bound
forms. From a cross-linguistic and theoretical perspective, while the description of
classificatory nouns can contribute to a better understanding of the ontology as well as,
perhaps, the ontogeny of classifying systems, the properties of special bound formatives
may serve as an inportant source of information on the interaction of syntactic and
morphological processes.
Since the present description of the Apurinã grammar is part of an on-going
research project, it was not possible to be equally specific about every part of the
grammar. As a consequence, chapters 8-9 describe only the major parts of the syntax of
the language. I should also note that the lack of a more detailed description of the syntax
of the language does not imply that there is little of specific behavior of forms that can be
characterized as syntactic in this language. Although it is the case that the Apurinã
syntax is not so much about inter-clausal operations, but much more about what happens
intra-clausally, much of the morphology of the language cannot be accounted for without
making reference to the clause or other clause-level elements.
To a great extent, the syntax of Apurinã consists of the functional or distributional
behavior expressed by bound formatives. The notions of a grammatical subject and a
grammatical object can be established partly on the basis of two paradigms of bound
pronominal forms, one used for subject and the other for object grammatical relations,
and the way these grammatical relations pattern in causative, reciprocal, reflexive and
relative constructions. Oblique grammatical relations are generally marked with oblique
615markers that attach to (pro)nominal forms. A VP constituent cannot be easily motivated
on the basis of language internal evidence and empirical grounds. Inter-clausal relations
can be marked with a few subordinator forms, but such relations are more often (in terms
of token as well as type sentences) expressed by juxtaposition —as is the case of sentence
conjoining.
Although Apurinã discourse-pragmatics and a detailed sociolinguistic description
of the language and its socio-cultural correlates have been left out of this study, they
constitute very important aspects of the language description that shall be part of future
revisions of this work. A part of the language where discourse and pragmatic factors play
a very important role is with respect to clausal constituent order variation, which is quite
free in the language. The socio-cultural variables that may play a significant role in
language variation may turn out to explain part of the “irregularities” attested in the
present description of the language grammar. Finally, in this work I have not attempted
to establish comparisons between Apurinã and other Arawak languages (except for the
preliminary reconstruction for Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari given in appendix D);
however, further investigation on diachronic developments in the grammar as well as
further typological-comparative work within Arawak might also shed new lights on
phenomena that seem to be arbitrary from a purely synchronic point of view.","[643, 644, 645, 646, 647]"
"Affectedness Marking: -nhi
The affectedness marker -nhi can also attach to noun bases, pronoun bases or tointransitive verb bases. In syntactic terms, when attached to noun bases, -nhi occurs with
nouns functioning as arguments changing in location/state (physically or metaphorically).
For this reason, in the past I have referred to this formative as a theme marker
(Facundes 1992, where the analysis, terminology and ideas are based on DeLancey 1991,
1984). Usually the change of location/state is accompanied by some negative
affectedness. It is based on its semantic properties that I will refer to -nhi as a marker of
affectedness. (I will postpone a more detailed discussion of the functions of -nhi to
chapter 8, in 8.3.1.4.) It is easy to perceive the notion of “affectedness” involved in the
use of -nhi. So, for example, take a noun stem such as powa ‘lake’; as shown in (18a),
when -nhi is added to this word, powa is understood to somehow have undergone some
change by being (negatively) affected by an action or process, thus leading
speakers/hearers to interpret it as ‘dried up lake’. The remaining examples in (18) follow
similar patterns, as also does the example given earlier in (15a), except that in (18d) -nhi
attaches to a pronominal base:
n-atama-ta
18a. upowa-nhi
lake-AFFECT 1SG-see-VBLZ
‘I saw the dried up lake.’
b. anãpa akatsata-ru kuki-nhi
dog
bite-3M.O man-AFFECT
‘The dog bit the injured man.’
c. suto-nhi
woman-AFFECT
‘the injured woman…’393d. uwa-nhi
hãkiti nhi-pe
3SG.M-AFFECT jaguar eat-PFTV
‘The jaguar has eaten him/it.’ (R:N)
When the affectedness marker attaches to intransitive verb bases, it adds the same
meaning as it does when added to noun bases, namely that of negative affectedness or
change in location/state. When attached to a verb base, the scope of the meaning of -inhi
is the core argument of an intransitive verb, as the next examples in (19) illustrate:
19a. i-nhipoko-ta-nhi-ko
3M-eat-VBLZ-AFFECT-FUT
‘He now feels like eating.’ (i.e. ‘He’s hungry’)
b. u-muteka-nhi-pẽ-ka
3M-run-AFFECT-PFTV-PASS
‘He (being hurt) had to run.’
c. u-muteka-nanu-ta-nhi-ka4
3M-run-AFFECT-VBLZ-AFFECT-PRED
‘He (being hurt) is running.’
The meaning of V-nhi would seem to suggest that it can occur both with transitive and
intransitive verbs. If that were the case, we would expect that with transitive verbs the
affectedness marker would most likely modify (semantically) the notional object of the
verb. However, so far I have not attested any instance of V-nhi where V is transitive.","[424, 425]"
"Future Marking: -koThe future marker -ko refers to the non-immediate future tense of the verb, but it
can, however, occur attached to noun bases, pronoun bases, numeral bases, and particle
bases, in addition to verb bases, thus constituting another example of a formative whose
scope is not necessarily the word it attaches to. I will return to discuss this marker in
chapter 8, in 8.6.1.1, where tense will be described in clausal context. The following
examples in (42) are illustrative of it:
42a. katarokuru-nanu-ra-ko
manioc.flour-RESTR-FOC-FUT
‘(It’s) only manioc flour (that) will...’
b. maku-putu-ka4-ra-ko
Brazil.nut-EMPH-PRED-FUT
‘(It’s) broken buckets (that) will...’
c. kopiti-ka4-ra-ko
o-kama
bucket-PRED-FOC-FUT 3F-make
‘(It’s) the bucket that she’ll make.’
d. nota-ko suka-ru
1SG-FUT give-3M.O
‘I’ll give away to him.’
e. hãt-u-kata-ra-ko
one-M-ASSOC-FOC-FUT
‘(It) will (be) with one that...’
f. kona-ko nhi-txiparu-te
nhi-suka-i
not-FUT 1SG-banana-POSSED 1SG-give-2O
‘I won’t give you banana.’
(42a-c) show the future marker attached to noun bases; (42d) shows the future marker
with a pronoun base; (42e) shows the future marker with a numeral base; and, (42f)
shows the marker with a negative particle.
410When attached to verb bases, -ko also marks the future tense, as the examples in
(43) (in addition to many earlier examples) demonstrate:
43a. nhi-nhipoko-ta-ko
1SG-eat-VBLZ-FUT
‘I will do eating.’
b. p-imaka-ko
2SG-sleep-FUT
‘You'll sleep.’
c. a-kama-ru-ko
1PL-make-POS-3M.O-FUT
‘We'll make it.’
d. o-taka-ru-ko
3F-put/plant-3M.O-FUT
‘She'll put it (somewhere)/plant it.’
In 8.6.1.1 I will discuss in detail the kind of future -ko marks.","[441, 442]"
"442Chapter 8Simplex Sentences
8.0. Introduction
This chapter describes both the constituency and relational properties of syntactic
expressions (i.e. NPs and NPobls) of the arguments of the verb and the various properties
of clauses and predicates found in the language. Particular attention is given to the NPs
encoding notional arguments required by the lexical meaning of the verb to show the
evidence that can be used to construe the core syntactic relations subject and object.
Chapters 3-7 have presented the internal morphological structure and the syntax of word
categories. Now it is also time to show whether it is required to make use of syntactic
notions different from the purely structural ones, and, furthermore, if such notions can be
motivated, to show what types of constructions arise when relational and constituent
syntactic properties are considered, and what their distribution in the clause is. Before
describing the relevant data and their syntactic status, a few syntactic labels need to be
introduced and properly defined.
In the previous chapters, I have used the term “clause” to refer to any construction
involving a (pro)nominal form (including bound pronominal markers) plus some
predication of it. In this and the next chapters I will continue to use clause to name any
syntactic construction containing a single predicator. So, the examples in (1a-b) are both
instances of clauses. In (1a), su-pe-ka-ko ‘go-PFTV-PRED-FUT’ is the predicator and
443nota ‘1SG’ is the argument of the verb; in (1b), sãpaka-pe-ka ‘be.tired-PFTV-PRED’ is
the predicator, and nota ‘1SG’ again is the argument of the verb:
1a. nota su-pe-ka-ko
1SG go-PFTV-PRED-FUT
‘I’ll get going.’
b. nota sãpaka-pe-ka
1SG be.tired-PFTV-PRED
‘I’m already tired.’
Furthermore, I will reserve the term sentence to name any one or more clauses
that can stand by themselves in Apurinã discourse. That is, an Apurinã sentence will
consist of a single independent clause or of an independent clause plus one (or more)
dependent (i.e. subordinate, see chapter 9, section 9.1) one(s). So, each one of the two
examples in (1) above constitutes an instance of a sentence, as well as the combination of
an independent and a dependent clause in (2):
2. nu-su-pe-ka-ko
kotxi
nu-sãpaka-pe-ka
1SG-go-PFTV-PRED-FUT SUBORD 1SG-be.tired-PFTV-PRED
‘I’ll get going because I’m already tired.’
What is of interest in this chapter are the mono-clausal sentences, as represented by the
examples in (1), rather than multi-clausal sentences, as represented by the example in (2).
In order to facilitate the presentation of mono- versus multi-clausal sentences I will refer
to the former as simplex sentences, and to the later as complex sentences. Complex
sentences will be dealt with in the next chapter. I should note that the term “simplex”
(rather than “simple”) is used here so as NOT to imply that the relevant sentences are
necessarily simpler in any trivial way than complex sentences, since it is possible for
certain simplex sentences to involve more complex structures than certain complex ones.
444In using the terms just introduced I intend to make a compromise between presenting a
description of the Apurinã syntax in terms of concepts that can be clearly motivated in
the language on the basis of its internal properties and that, at the same time, are
crosslinguistically sound.
Therefore, sentence, as it is defined in the syntax of Apurinã, is an abstract
construct that can only achieve audible realization through clause(s). What the next
sections will show is that such an abstract concept is not only useful but, also, it can be
easily motivated on the basis of the data to be described in this and the next chapter.
Moreover, such a definition of the Apurinã sentence will partly match the (perhaps) most
often cited general definitions of “sentence” found in the linguistic literature, such as the
ones represented by (3-8):
3. “The sentence is considered here not as a unit consisting of a predicate and nouns
related to it (a simple clause), but rather as a combination of such units (clauses) into still
larger structures of a sort here summarized.” (Longacre 1985:235)
4. “The sentence is the largest unit of grammatical description.” (Bloomfield, as
presented in Lyons 1968:172)
5. “As a grammatical unit, the sentence is an abstract entity in terms of which the linguist
accounts for the distributional relations holding within utterances.” (1968:176)
6. “[T]he sentence in turn can be defined as the maximal unit of syntax, or the largest
unit over which constructional relations hold.” (Matthews 1981:29)
7. The sentence is “[t]he largest unit in terms of which the grammar of a language is
organized.” (Crystal 1992:349)4458. “In generative grammar, [the sentence is] the syntactic category which is taken as the
largest category capable of syntactic characterization, all of its component parts being
bound together by rules of syntax and its entire structure being well-formed.” (Trask
1992:250-251)
However, one should also bear in mind that there are perhaps as many putative
crosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” as the number of different syntactic theories.
The definition used here follows from the properties of the Apurinã grammar as well as
(partly) from what implicitly or explicitly is found in some of those putative
crosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” (such as the ones given in 3-8). In the way
conceived here, the notion of “sentence”, as unit of syntax, is an abstract construct in a
way analogous to the way in which “phoneme”, as a unit of phonology, and “morpheme”,
as unit of morphology, also are abstract constructs.18.1. The Structure of Phrases
The goal of this section is to motivate and describe the constituent structure of
clauses. In providing evidence for parts of speech as units involved in the organization of
clauses, by implication, I have also provided motivation for treating words as constituents
of the clause. What needs to be examined now is the extent to which words can combine
into larger constituents within a clause. There is no question that words constitute
individual constituents within the clause. So, for example, in the first of the three clauses
in (9a), suto ‘woman’ occurs preceding the verb apo-pe ‘arrive-PFTV’. As shown by the1I have found particular useful the discussions in Lyons 1968:172-180 and Matthews 1981:ch.2 on the various
definitions of “sentence”, where detailed references on the subject are also provided.","[473, 474, 475, 476, 477]"
"3.5.1Affixes
Affixes are the bound formatives used individually or as part of a paradigm toencode grammatical categories generally associated with a specific word class. Different
affixes can precede (as prefixes) or (exclusively) follow (as suffixes) the word base they
attach to, but no affix can interrupt (as an infix) a formative. The plural suffix -wako-ru
illustrated in (4) and the nominalizer suffix -re illustrated in (10b) are instances of typical
affixes. There is one instance of an affix combination that may be analyzed as a circumfix
(or a discontinuous morpheme), namely the forms involved in marking third person plural,
u-... -na; however, I will also consider the possibility of describing this potential case of
circumfix as an instance of discontinuous dependencies (Spencer 1991:210), a notion137independently motivated in the language by a specific subset of verbal formatives.
Conceivably, in discontinuous dependencies two forms may work together to encode a
lexical meaning or grammatical function without necessarily constituting a single
morpheme. (E.g., the verb plus particle combinations in English, as in call him up.)3.5.2Other Special Types of Bound Formatives
Apart from the forms that behave as typical affixes in the language, there are variousbound formatives that show a behavior distinct from typical affixes in the following ways:
They occur outside of typical affixes, some of them “float” in the clause, and they tend to
interact in special ways with syntactic phenomena. The special bound formatives that occur
with different word classes can be illustrated by the associative oblique marker -kata, as in
nota-kata ‘with me’, ata-kata ‘with us’, unawa-kata ‘with them’ etc.
The special bound formatives that occur with different word classes and that
fluctuate in the clause can be illustrated by the future marker -ko in (11), where -ko
occurs either attached to the pronoun or to the verb without any change in the
propositional meaning of the clause:
11a. nota muteka-ko
1SG run-FUT
b. nota-ko
muteka
1SG-FUT run‘I’ll run away.’
‘I’ll run away.’The detailed description of the properties of these special types of bound formatives and the
extent to which they relate to cliticization phenomena is done in chapter 7, in 7.3.","[168, 169]"
"1283.3.1Morphemes, Morphs, Formatives, Allomorphs
Perhaps the second issue where morphologists diverge the most, after the definitionof “word”, is as to how to define the notion of a “morpheme” (for those who believe there is
such a thing). Instead of going through attempts to establish an independent definition of
the term (and at the risk of some circularity), I will simply refer to morpheme as an abstract
morphological construct that is particularly useful in describing word structure in Apurinã.
A word may have one or more morpheme in an analogous way that it can also have one or
more phoneme. Since a morpheme is an abstract morphological unit, it requires a phonetic
shape in order to be audibly expressed. The phonetic expression of a morpheme is a morph,
analogously to phone (i.e. the phonetic expression of a phoneme). Moreover, since it is a
common assumption in the morphological literature that “the term ‘morph’ implies the
realization of a morpheme” (Bauer 1994), so much so that a morph that does not realize a
morpheme is called an empty morph, I will reserve the term formative to refer to both
morphs that do and morphs that do not realize a morpheme; also, I will use the term
formative when I want to be intentionally vague (or neutral) as to whether a form realizes or
not a morpheme (Idem, Anderson 1985:150, 161). “Formative” will then be the superordinate term for morph and empty morph (in a way roughly similar to the term
exponent/exponency, also found in the literature, Bauer 1994:243 and Spencer 1991:41).
Finally, morphs that do realize a morpheme and that are conditioned by a phonological,
lexical or grammatical context will be called allomorphs of that morpheme (Bauer 1994:15,
analogously to allophone in phonology). The difference between the notion ‘allomorph’ and
the notion ‘morph’ is that it is part of the definition of the former that its phonetic realization129is conditioned by the phonology, lexicon or the grammar of the language. Such
conditioning factors are not part of the notion ‘morph’.
Having introduced the labels above, I will now summarize the sort of properties that
will be considered relevant for the identification of formatives in the language. As was the
case for words, morphemes can also be described in terms of their form and meaning. In the
ideal cases each morphemic form will correspond to a specific meaning, so that the ideal
morphemes will consist of a particular form that is consistently associated with one specific
meaning. This is the so-called one-to-one mapping between form and meaning (Anderson
1988:151-153). If, however, all there was to a morphological description was the
description of one-to-one mappings between the forms and meanings of various formatives
there would probably be no reason to even describe morphology separately from syntax. In
some cases it is not easy to decide whether certain forms constitute allomorphs of the same
morpheme, different morphemes, or whether they even are segmentable formatives at all. It
is precisely because many other factors may be involved in the identification of formatives,
aside from the form-meaning mapping, that I will make use of a list of factors which will
constitute useful guidelines in the identification of morphemes. The list of factors used here
follows partly from an extrapolation of the properties described in Bauer 1994, chapter 8, as
those identifying affixes and bases. The properties to be considered in the identification of
formatives are then as in (9):
9a. meaning of a putative formative;
b. function of a putative formative (verbalizer, nominalizer etc);
c. (phonological) form of a putative formative;
d. part of speech of the word base (noun, verb etc.) that a putative formative attaches to;130e. phonological, grammatical or semantic restrictions on the word base that a putative
formative attaches to;
f. range of allomorphs displayed by a putative formative;
g. form a putative formative imposes to the word base;
h. whether a putative formative is required before another formative can occur in the same
word base, i.e. whether it potentiates a subsequent formative;
i. degrees of productivity of a putative formative;
j. whether a putative formative occupies a position class in the base;
k. whether a putative formative is in complementary distribution with another one;
l. recurrence of a putative formative.
No single property in (9) is used here as a necessary and sufficient condition for the
identification of a formative; rather, the list constitutes a range of properties commonly
associated with formatives that can be analyzed as morphemes or allomorphs or empty
morphs. When used in combination these properties will serve as a set of procedures to
identify not only the general morphological unit formative (as opposed to morphologically
inconsequent phonological chunks), but also the sub-type of formative in question, i.e.
allomorph, morpheme or empty morph. The data to be represented in chapters 4-7 will
provide examples where some of the decisions on whether a formative constitutes a
morpheme or not will be, ultimately, a theory-driven judgment. However, the properties
listed in (9) will (hopefully) provide completely consistent results. Table 1 lists the values
for each of the relevant properties that will determine whether a putative formative realizes a
morpheme, allomorphs of a single morpheme, or an empty morph, or whether the putative
formative is just a morphologically inconsequent phonological chunk:131Table 1: Defining Properties of Formatives

NOTable 1 reads as follows:
I- Meaning: Morphemes and allomorphs will normally have a meaning systematically
associated with them, whereas both empty morphs and non-formatives will not;
II- Function: Morphemes and allomorphs may have a function associated with them (e.g.
nominalizer, verbalizer, etc.), whereas both empty morphs and non-formatives will not;
III- Form: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs will normally have a constant
shape with predictable variations, whereas non-formatives will not;
IV- Part of Speech of base (P.O.S.): Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may be
restricted to a specific word category, whereas this may not happen to non-formatives;
V- Restrictions on base: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may also be
restricted to bases with specific phonological or semantic properties, whereas this does
not happen to non-formatives;
VI- Range of allomorphs: Morphemes and empty morphs may not only exhibit
allomorphic variants, but also different morphemes and different empty morphs may
exhibit distinct allomorphic variants, whereas non-formatives may not exhibit such
variants at all;
VII- Form imposed on base: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may cause
systematic changes in the underlying form of a base, whereas non-formatives will not;
VIII- Potentiation of other formative: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may132“create a suitable base for” another formative, whereas non-formatives will not;
IX- Degree of productivity: Morphemes and empty morphs may exhibit degrees of
productivity that may be used to distinguish between two morphemes or two empty
morphs, whereas non-formatives may not;
X- Position class: Morphemes, their allomorphs, and empty morphs may occupy a
position class in the word it occurs within, whereas non-formatives will not;
XI- Complementary distribution: Allomorphs of the same morpheme will always be
mutually exclusive, whereas morphemes, empty morphs or non-formatives will not;
XII- Recurrence: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs will recur in the word
bases they are allowed to occur, whereas non-formatives will not;
Therefore the list given in Table 1 works as sort of tests to determine whether
something is a formative or not, and what type of formative it is. As seen in this table, every
positive value assigned to the category morpheme implies a positive value to the category
allomorph. This follows from the assumption that every morpheme is necessarily realized
as at least one allomorph. Thus wherever there is a morpheme there will necessarily be at
least one allomorph, whereas the converse does not hold. The application of the tests given
above will be illustrated as they are applied in chapters 4-6.
A necessary initial step in the description of the structure of words is to establish
(preliminarily) the classes of words found in the language. Some introductory notes on the
major classes of words found in the language are in order and are presented next.","[159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"

c. uwa
su-pe?
3SG.M go-PFTV
‘Has he left yet?’

d. u-muteka?
3M-run
‘Did he run?’8.8.2.2Information Questions
Generally speaking, information questions (also known as WH questions) “areused typically when the speaker and the hearer share the knowledge of a proposition —it
is presupposed or backgrounded —but the speaker does not know one element in the
proposition” (Givón 1990:2.793). As seen in the next subsections, various elements in a
sentence can be questioned. The major elements within a sentence that can be questioned
using a set of systematic question forms include subject/object, place, time, reason and
manner. The interrogative words are always sentence-initial.
8.8.2.2.1Questioning subject and objectThe form used to question the subject or object of a verb is ke-pa (or ki-pa,
depending on speech variety). As described in chapter 6, interrogative words in Apurinã
can be compared with interrogative words in other languages. ke- and -pa can be
compared with the WH initial in English or the QU initial in Romances languages such as
Portuguese. The difference is that ke- and -pa are more clearly segmentable as
morphemes in Apurinã, whereas the others are synchronically more opaque forms, and
also that ke- and -pa are two recurring forms in interrogative words, whereas there is only537one recurring form in English and Portuguese. The following examples are illustrative of
interrogative words questioning subject/object:
113a. ke-pa
oka-pe-ru
uwa-nhi?
WH-INT kill-PFTV-3M.O 3SG.M-AFFECT
‘Who/what has killed kill him/it?’
b. ke-pa
p-oka-pe?
WH-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV
‘What/who have you killed?’
As the following examples show, when nouns such as suto ‘man’ and xenhi
‘meat’ occur as part of the interrogative word, the argument being questioned is more
specific, being semantically modified by the interrogative word:
114a. ke-suto-pa
kariwa
txa-wa?
WH-woman-INT white.person be-REFL
‘Which woman is a white person?’
b. ke-xenhi-pa
hare-ka?
WH-meat-INT be.good-PRED
‘Which meat is good?’
The interrogative forms in which a noun occurs as part of interrogative words
have been clearly attested in some speech varieties, and were also reported in Pickering
1977b. However, at least one speaker from the Paciá village reported that he himself
would rather use forms such as the following, where nhi- is added to mark subject/object
as a specific one:
115a. nhi-ke-ro-pa
kariwa
txa-wa?
SPEC-WH-3F-INT white.person be-REFL
‘Which woman is a white person?’538b. nhi-ke-ru-pa
ãkiti
oka-pe?
SPEC-WH-3M-INT jaguar kill-PFTV
‘Which jaguar has killed him/it?’
Further research is necessary in order to determine the extent to which this second type of
question marking is common in other speech varieties.
8.8.2.2.2Questioning TimeIn order to question time the TEMPORAL bound form -sawaku is added as part
of ke-pa subject/object interrogative word form, following the gender marker -ru, as the
following example illustrates:
116a. ke-ru-sawaku-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
WH-3M-TEMP-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘When have you killed the jaguar?’8.8.2.2.3Questioning ReasonIn questioning reasons it is the noun form nere ‘will, volition’ that is added as part
of the subject/object interrogative word form, as the following examples illustrate:
117a. ke-nere-pa
kariwa
i-txa-pẽ-ka-wa?
WH-will-INT white.person be-PFTV-PASS-REFL
‘Why has he become a white person?’
b. ke-nere-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
WH-will-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Why have you killed the jaguar?’8.8.2.2.4Questioning PlaceIn order to question places the interrogative word form nhã-pa (or yã-pa,
depending on speech variety) is used. The place interrogative word can occur by itself
539introducing an interrogative sentence questioning a place, as illustrated in (118a), or it
can have a pronominal bound form or the GOAL postpositional marker added into the
interrogative word form, as the examples in (118b-c), respectively, illustrate:
118a. nhã-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
PLACE-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Where did you kill the jaguar?’
b. nhã-õ-pa
o-su-pe-ru?
PLACE-3F-INT 3F-go-PFTV-3M.O
‘Where has she gone?’
c. nha-monhi-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
PLACE-GOAL-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Where have you killed the jaguar?’
There is also an unrelated form that is used to question places, namely atapa-ru
(or ĩtepa-ru, depending on the speech variety). This second interrogative word form for
places does not allow the addition of other forms into it and is generally used in sentences
with nominal predicates, such as the one illustrated in the next example:
119. ata-pa-ru
ãkiti?
PLACE-INT-3M jaguar
‘Where is the jaguar?’8.8.2.2.5Questioning MannerIn order to question manner, the manner interrogative word kanhi-pa is used. The
manner interrogative word does not allow the addition of other forms into it. The
following examples are instances of kanhi-pa being used to introduce interrogative
sentences questioning manner:540120a. kanhi-pa
o-txa?
MANNER-INT 3F-do
‘How did she do (it)?’
b. kanhi-pa
pi-txa-pe?
MANNER-INT 2SG-do-PFTV
‘How did you do (it)?’
For interrogative sentences questioning manner there is also an unrelated form
that can be used, in addition to kanhi-pa, namely natoko-pa, as the following example
demonstrates. This second manner interrogative word also does not allow the addition of
other forms into it.
121. natoko-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
MANNER-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘In which way have you killed the jaguar?’
8.8.2.3Indirect Content Questions
Indirect questions (or dependent interrogatives or embedded-WH questions,(Sadock and Zwicky 1985:186 and Givón 1990:2.804-806) consist of interrogative
clauses whose verbs take an information question as complement. Examples of such
verbs may include ‘ask’, ‘know’, and ‘announce’. Different from languages like English
and Portuguese, however, Apurinã does not make use of interrogative words in indirect
question. Instead, indirect questions use the same formal device of relative clauses
(described in detail in the next chapter, subsection 9.1.1), as illustrated in (122).

5418.8.3 Imperative Speech Acts
Imperative speech acts consists of “syntactic forms that explicitly convey some
subset of requests/commands/orders/suggestions/instructions/entreaties, and so on”
(Sadock and Zwicky 1985:170). Pickering (1971:28) lists various forms as marking
subsets of “imperative verbs”. However, commands, requests and instructions take no
special markers in the spontaneous discourse of any the speech varieties I have observed.
The only form I have observed to occur marking these imperative speech acts is the
bound verbal morpheme -poka, but this form was given by one speaker in elicited data.
The fact that this bound morpheme has been only found in elicited speech may suggest
that it is being left out of the language in more contemporaneous speech varieties. -poka
was described by Pickering as marking a “polite command”. The way they are used now
is more as commands, as the following examples illustrate:
123a. ĩporãã p-apa-poka
watxa
water 2SG-fetch-IMPER now
‘Go get water now.’
b. p-umaka-poka
2SG-sleep-IMPER
‘Go sleep.’
Other than examples such as these above, commands, orders etc. take no
additional marking forms. Instead, they lack a subject expressed by an independent NP;
their subject is expressed solely by the bound pronominal form for the second person
singular subject. In the following examples in (124), the sentences can be uttered as
command in (124a), a request in (124b) (repeated from (74)), and a warning in (124c):542124a. xamuna pu-taka xãã-poki-ã
firewood 2SG-put flame-border-INSTR
‘Put firewood in the fire.’
b. ĩporãã pu-suka-no
water 2SG-give-1SG.O
‘Bring me water.’
c. tsora! pu-muteka!
Tsora 2SG-run
‘Tsora! Run!’8.8.3.1Hortative Speech Act
Hortative sentences can be considered the subtype of imperative speech actwhere “the speaker is encouraging or inciting someone to action” (Bybee et al 1994:179),
thus different from commands, orders, instructions and the like. Hortative sentences are
marked with the clause-initial (h)amo ‘HORTATIVE’ particle already mentioned in
chapter 6. (h)amo is found in clauses about inviting someone to go somewhere, do
something (e.g. eat, dance, etc.) and so on. Aside from occurring only clause initially,
another restriction of this hortative marker is that it can only be used with first person
plural, as the following examples illustrate:
125a. hamo a-su-pe
HORT 1PL-go-PFTV
‘Let’ get going.’
b. hamo a-nhipoko-ta
HORT 1PL-eat-VBLZ

Distinctions
The notions of grammatical subject and grammatical object can be motivated on
the basis of various ways that the syntactic expressions of notional subject and notional
object behave in the clause, as summarized in Table 1. The distinct marking or
behavioral properties that the syntactic expressions of subject and object have in the same
set of clauses characterize a syntactic distinction between the two.

replaced with -kakaAt this stage in the description of the language no other unambiguous syntactic evidence
has be attested for distinguishing subject from object syntactically. Some of the syntactic
tests generally used to distinguish core grammatical relations are not conclusive, since the
results can be accounted for on semantic or discourse-pragmatic grounds rather than
syntactically. For this reason, I have defined subject and object over the coreferential
544properties of NPs with the pronominal markers in the verb. However, there are certain
problems that arise from defining subject and object over such morphosyntactic markers
(as will be seen in the discussion of relative clauses in the next chapter, in 9.1.1.6).
Finally, the distribution of subject and object NPs in simplex sentences cannot be
predicted on grammatical grounds. Further research is necessary in order to establish
whether/which specific discourse-pragmatic factors play any significant role in the
“decision” of Apurinã speakers to use one or another of the clausal constituent orders
found in the language. Nevertheless, it would appear that none of the clausal constituent
order types in the language can be argued to be more basic/neutral/unmarked than the
other in any way other than in terms of rather theory-specific assumptions or principles,
as will be shown in the next section.","[567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576]"
"516an event to be bounded temporally it is necessary that it take place within the time frame
over which it occurs (Chung and Timberlake 1985:219). For a state to be bounded
temporally it is necessary that it remain unchanged during the time frame over which it
takes place. In (92a) the sentence is part of a narrative where the speaker describes one
of the steps necessary to make the tobacco powder. The initial temporal particle
delimitates the time frame within which the event is bounded. In the example in (92b)
the narrator presents another bounded event where, as result of the young woman having
gone see the tapir, she (the young woman) ends up having to accompany the tapir into the
jungle:

As the following examples in (93) are illustrative of, the perfective marker can
also be used to mark stative predicates when the state they express remains within the
bounds of the established time frame. In both (93a-b) the stative predicates are located
within the time frame expressed by the initial particles, and they take the perfective
marker:

‘Now he’s here.’
The first of the “secondary” uses of the perfective marker illustrated below is that
of completive. As a general definition, the completive aspect is one where an event is
done “thoroughly and to a completion” (Bybee et al 1994:54, 57-61). The example in
(94a) describes a step in the process of making manioc flour. The example in (94b)
narrates what happened to a tapir after some hunters beat it and shoot arrows at it to
death. It should be noted that, in general, the contexts where the perfective also marks
completion, the temporal “boundedness” is also present.

Moreover, the meaning of completive aspect is particularly reinforced when the
perfective marker is combined with the passive marker -~ka, as the examples given in
(27) in the previous chapter, in 7.1.8, (repeated below as 95) illustrated.

Another “secondary” use of the perfective marker is as anterior aspect. Anterior
(also called perfect) aspect “signals that the situation occurs prior to reference time and is
relevant to the situation at reference time” (Bybee et al 1994:54, 61-63). In the example
in (96a) the sentence consists of two clauses: The first clause establishes the reference
time (the moment when somebody arrives at the village), and the second clause describes
an event that has happened prior to the reference time (the making of the manioc bread),
but still relevant to it (the availability of the manioc bread to be then eaten). The example
in (96b) also comes with two clauses: In the first clause the speaker tells about what is
going on with the kid (he is crying), while in the second clause the speaker tells about an
event that happened prior to the kid’s crying (his getting injured with the fish-hook) and
which led to the kid’s crying (it must have hurt him).

519A third “secondary” use of the perfective marker is to mark a sort of resultative
aspect. A resultative aspect “signal[s] that a state exists as a result of past action” (Bybee
et al 1994:54, 63-68). In (97a) two clauses are given as illustrations: The second clause
is the same as the one given in (93a) above as an instance of a temporally bounded state;
and the first clause is the one that preceded the second clause in the text where they are
extracted from. When the two clauses are analyzed together, what can be seen is that the
second one (with perfective marker) expresses the state (of being pregnant) as a
consequence/result of the event expressed in the first clause (i.e. having had sexual
intercourse with the tapir). In (97b) the sentence refers to the same young woman who,
as a result of living with the tapir in the jungle, having just seen the tapir be killed in front
of her, and for having her relatives after her trying to take her back to the village, now “is
afraid”. Since in this second example the temporal “boundedness” is not emphasized, it
seems plausible to conclude that here the perfective marker is functioning more as a
resultative marker.

An inchoative aspect highlights a change of state expressed by the predicate (Bybee et al
1994:75). For example, the context in which (98a) is used is one where the furnace for
frying the manioc flour reaches the state of being hot. As to the other sentence in (98b),
it is used in a context where the speaker is talking about the things his relatives forgot
about the Apurinã ways of being, the new habits acquired and all other things that make
them nowadays ‘be like “white people”’.

‘It’s nowadays that we’ve become like “whites”.’
Finally, perfectivity in Apurinã is not necessarily temporally bounded within past
time frames. As shown by (99a) (repeated from 89b), a situation can also be marked as
perfective in the future. So, in (99a) the speaker is a (human-like) tapir who “kidnapped”
a young woman, was being tracked down in the jungle by the young woman’s relatives,
and, having realized it was being hunted, tells the young woman that her relatives are
going to kill it (the tapir) when they find them (the young woman and the tapir). The use
of the perfective marker in clauses expressing future situations may also be associated
with the discourse use of -pe to also mark a certain degree of emphasis of the predicate.
This emphasis is clearer in (99b) where the narrator tells us of what happened to the tapir
once it was found by the woman’s relatives. In (99b) the meaning of the predicate is
emphasized with the presence of -pe:

By way of concluding this section, I will now show that past sentences do not
automatically take the perfective marker. The context in which (100a) is used is one
where the narrator tells about the decision of some the woman’s relatives (mentioned
above) to go after a tapir who had “kidnapped” a young woman from their village. The
sentence is in the past but no perfective marker is used. The example in (100b) is uttered
by the narrator to describe what had happened to the young woman before they found
her; and here the event not only is in the past but, also, is one that already came into a
completion. With these last examples, I want to show that it is not the case that any event
that came into a completion will automatically take the perfective marker.17

"5338.8.1 Declarative Speech Acts
A declarative speech act “is typically used in the expression of a statement —that
is, a ‘declaration’ that something is or is not the case.” (Crystal 1992:95). Most of the
Apurinã sentences given as examples above are declarative. Declarative sentences can be
contrasted with interrogative sentences (described further below) prosodically insofar as
the former has no marked intonational pattern while the latter do. That is, prosodically
speaking, a declarative sentence can be characterized as having neutral intonation.
Declarative sentences can, moreover, be regular/unmarked or frustrative.
8.8.1.1Regular/Unmarked Declarative Speech Act
Regular/unmarked declarative sentences require no formal marker, and theycan be considered the prototypical declarative sentences. All the examples presented
above in this chapter are instances of regular/unmarked declarative sentences.
8.8.1.2Frustrative/Adversative Declarative Speech Act
A frustrative (or adversative) declarative sentence is used in the expression ofevents that might have brought about certain results (under other circumstances), but that
(in actuality) they did not. Frustrative sentences are declarative because they consist of
statements of events with frustrated results and, thus these sentences cannot take an
interrogative or imperative form. The initial clause in each of the following examples in
(111a-b) is marked with the frustrative bound form -ma, and the final clause justifies the
characterized frustration. (111a,c) shows a special use of the frustrative marker when
combined with the future marker -ko to express a meaning analogous to the main clause
of a counterfactual conditional (see 8.6.1.1):534s-V

Notice that the conditional-like meaning only arises when -ma is combined with
-ko, and, in general there is ambiguity between the frustrative and the conditional-like
meaning, as can be seen in (111a,c).","[564, 565, 566]"
"9.1.2 Complement Subordination
Complement subordination is here defined as the process by which a complex
sentence is formed of two or more clauses, wherein one functions as the subject/object of
the other. Although complex sentences (and hence complementation) are less common in
Apurinã than, for example, in languages like English, two general types of complements
can be distinguished on the basis of whether they carry any formal marker of
subordination. In other words, complements can be described in terms of how
(dis)similar they are to a full sentence. Complements that carry no formal marking of
subordination and that, thus, resemble the most complete sentences, are described under
full sentence complements. Complements that carry a formal marking of subordination
and/or that are reduced forms of full sentences are described under marked
complements. A full sentence complement is to be understood as a complete sentence
that minimally has all the (morpho)syntactic expressions of the core arguments (i.e.
subject and/or object), where such (morpho)syntactic expressions may take the form of
the phrasal units described in chapter 8, section 8.1.1, or of the subject/object pronominal
markers described in chapter 7, in subsections 7.1.1 and 7.1.12. The constituent structure
of the clauses that realize a complete sentence was provided in 8.1.1.1, and the types of
these clauses were described in chapter 8.4.
The current description of complementation is more of a general survey of the
complement types found in the language based on their formal properties than an indepth analysis of each of these types. Further analysis on the behavioral properties of the
597complements and their sub-components is necessary, as well as analysis specifically
about the semantics of the complement-taking verbs. The terms used here to label the
semantic category of the complement-taking verbs (i.e. utterance, perception,
knowledge... verbs) as well as the semantic classification itself are partly based on
Noonan (1985:110-133).
9.1.2.1Full Sentence Complements
Full sentence complements are those that carry no formal subordination markingand that can stand by themselves as a sentence. Full sentence complements can function
as objects of utterance verbs, immediate perception verbs, and at least one manipulative
verb.
In the first pair of examples in (44) the full sentence complements (between
brackets) are direct quotations that function as objects of the utterance verb txa ‘say’: (In
the examples below brackets are used to highlight the complement of the sentence.)

As can be seen from (44) and (45a), there is no formal distinction between direct
and indirect quotation as a complement object of the utterance verb. The distinction
between direct in indirect quotation, however, can be made prosodically, with a longer
pause between the verb form and its complement for direct quotations. I should also note
that the utterance verb txa has one property that distinguishes it from other complement
taking verbs, namely that its complement necessarily precedes it. So, the following
example in (46) can be compared to the one given in (44b) to illustrate the property that
the utterance verb txa has of allowing only pre-verbal complement clauses. As shown by
both of the ungrammatical translations of the example in (46), this distributional
restriction on the complement of the utterance verb txa applies regardless of whether the
complement txa is a direct or indirect quotation:

The next pair of examples in (47) further illustrates full sentence complement
objects of utterance verbs, here with the verb sãpire-ta ‘to tell’:599S

The semantic difference between sãpire-ta and txa, is that the former is the one used to
mean ‘to tell a story’, but that, different from ‘tell’ in English, does not take a third core
argument. Otherwise, there is a partial overlap in the semantics of these two utterance
verbs. Moreover, the pre-verbal restriction on the complements of txa does not apply to
sãpire-ta:
The examples provided in (48) illustrate the immediate perception complementtaking verb etuka ‘to see’, in (48a-b), and a manipulative complement-taking verb akirita

Aside from the unmarked full sentences that function as the complement in theexamples presented above, there are marked complements clauses that carry the gerund
marked -inhi, morphologically described in chapter 4, subsection 4.4.7, and that
constitute the most common type of complement clauses found in the language. In 4.4.7
the gerund marker was described as part of the noun stem morphology; at the end of this
subsection the syntactic category of the verb forms to which -inhi attaches will be revised
on the basis of the syntactic properties presented below. Further distinctions among
complement clauses can be established on the basis of the formal marking properties of
their major components.
The first type of marked complement clauses to be described is one marked with
-inhi in the verb and whose undergoer is marked as object of the matrix clausal verb.
That is, insofar as the formal marking goes, these examples can be described as
constructions where the undergoer object of the transitive verb in the complement clause
is “raised” into the object of the verb in the matrix clause. The term “raising” (and its
derived forms) is with quotation marks so as to highlight the fact that the term is being
used here to refer to linguistic phenomena that only partially fit into the established
typology of raising constructions (as, e.g., the one discussed in Noonan 1985:68-73).
As the example in (49) shows, complements with object-object “raising” can
occur with a knowledge verb. In this example, -inhi occurs in the second clause to make
it a subordinate clause functioning as the object of the first clause:601s-V-o
[ O
s-V-GER-o ]
49. Ø-umarota-putu-ka-ro
[ããta u-kam-inhi-ro]
3M-know-EMPH-PRED-3F.O canoe 3M-make-GER-3F.O
‘He knows how to make canoe.’
In (49) ããta ‘canoe’ is the object of the verb u-kam-inhi-ro in the complement clause.
Although the presence of the coreference marker -ro in this verb would normally indicate
that ããta is the grammatical object in the complement clause (see grammatical properties
of the object under 8.3.1.2), there are two additional properties in the sentence suggesting
otherwise. The first is that, as shown in 8.3.1.2, it is a post-verbal (rather than pre-verbal)
object that is accompanied of the coreferential pronominal marker in the verb; and the
second is that there is also a coreferential pronominal marker -ro in the verb of the matrix
clause, thus indicating that ããta is in fact object in the matrix clause. One way to account
for the coreference marking in both the verbs of the matrix and the subordinating clause
is by postulating that the object of the complement clause has been “raised” to be the
object in the matrix clause, leaving a pronominal “copy” in the complement clause.
At the present time, this object-object “raising” analysis is a hypothesis that is
based on the formal marking of the objects in sentences such as the one illustrated above.
Further information on the behavior of the object in question is required in order to
demonstrate the viability of such a hypothesis.
The next examples in (50) illustrate complement clauses with -inhi attached to a
desiderative verb. In (50a) nu-serepi ‘my arrow’ is the undergoer and kuku is the
recipient of the verb marked with -inhi in the complement clause. However, the recipient
of the verb in the complement clause is marked (by the coreferential pronominal marker
-ru) as the object of the verb in the matrix clause. The undergoer serepi ‘arrow of’, as a
feminine noun, would require the pronominal marker -ro, rather than the masculine -ru.
602Moreover, as shown by the ungrammaticality of (50b), the marking of the undergoer
object of the verb in the complement clause as the object of the verb in the matrix clause
is an obligatory property of complex sentences with complements containing a
potentially ditransitive predicate. The example in (50b) is only ungrammatical because
the pronominal marker attached to the verb in the matrix clause is coreferential with the
undergoer (rather than with the recipient) of the verb:
s-V-o
[UNDERGOER O s-V-GER ]
[nu-serepi
kuku nu-suk-inhi]
50a. nu-nereka-ka-ru
1SG-want-PRED-3M.O 1SG-arrow.of(F) man 1SG-give-GER
‘I want to give the man my arrow.’
s-V-o
[ O
RECIPIENT s-V-GER ]
b. *nu-nereka-ka-ro
[nu-serepi
kuku
nu-suk-inhi]
1SG-want-PRED-3F.O 1SG-arrow.of(F) man
1SG-give-GER
(I want to give the man my arrow.)
One way to explain the marking of the recipient of the verb in the complement
clause as the object of the verb in the matrix clause is by positing a “raising” of the
“recipient” expression in the complement clause into the object in the matrix clause.
Here, again, although this “raising” hypothesis would explain the formal marking
properties involving the objects of these complex sentences, it would be desirable to find
additional information on the behavioral properties of such objects that would confirm (or
disprove) this hypothesis. Ideally, a more detailed investigation into the behavioral
properties of core grammatical relations should reveal further distinctions between
subject and object. However, it remains to be shown whether such additional behavioral
distinctions are actually found in the language.
While the types of complements presented above are analyzable as object to
object “raising” constructions, the second type to be described would seem to involve an
603equi-object-control deletion, where the object of the complement-taking verb and the
subject of the verb in the complement clause are identical. In this second type of
complement the subject of the verb in the complement clause marked by -inhi is
coreferential with the object of the verb in the matrix clause. In both the examples in (51)
the subordinate clause is a complement of the manipulative verb awirita ‘allow’, is
marked by -inhi in the verb, and its subject is coreferential with the subject pronominal
marker n- in the complement clause and with object pronominal marker -no in the matrix
clause:
S
V-o
[ s-V-GER ]
[n-umak-inhi]
51a. natxi
kona
awirita-no
hunger not
allow-1SG.O 1SG-sleep-GER
‘The hunger didn’t let me sleep.’

kona
awirita-no
[n-umak-inhi]
be.thirsty-UNPOSS not
allow-1SG.O 1SG-sleep-GER
‘The thirst didn’t let me sleep.’
The third and last type of complement clauses marked with -inhi consists of those
that differ from full sentences in that they take the gerund marker -inhi and in that they
take a pronominal marker attached to the verb where such a marker could be interpreted
as coreferential with the complement itself, rather than with one of its arguments. In the
first pair of examples given in (52) the complex sentences have, respectively, the
commentative complement-taking verb potxita ‘like’ and the desiderative
complement-taking verb nereka ‘want’. In these examples the verbs of the complement
clauses are intransitive, they take the gerund marker as well as the bound pronominal
forms for first person singular subject. Moreover, the complement clauses in these604examples function as object of the complement-taking verbs, being marked as such with
the default gender marker for third person object, -ru, in the matrix verb:
S
V-o
[s-V-GER
]
52a. nota potxita-ru [n-okatsã-t-inhi]
1SG like-3M.O 1SG-fish-VBLZ-GER
‘I like fishing.’
S
V-o
[s-V-GER
]
b. nota nereka-ka-ru
[nhi-nhipoko-t-inhi]
1SG want-PRED-3M.O 1SG-eat-VBLZ-GER
‘I want to eat.’
It is important to observe that this third type of marked complements is
translatable into English as equi-subject constructions (i.e. where the subject of the
complement clause in deleted under identity with the subject of the matrix clause.)
Different from English, however, in Apurinã the subject of the complement clause is not
deleted, but rather expressed as a bound pronominal marker in the verb of the
complement clause.
In concluding this subsection, I must reiterate that the analysis just presented
above for the three types of marked complements is not intended to be a definitive, since
supporting evidence is still required to (dis)prove its validity. Finally, it would be
conceivable to posit a very distinct analysis where the marked complement clauses would
only be syntactically different from full sentence complements in that the latter lack the
gerund marker -inhi. Nonetheless, the fact that the argument of the complement clause is
marked as argument of the matrix clause needs somehow to be explained. What is
presented here is one possible account of such marking patterns.","[628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636]"
"2154.4. Noun Stem Morphology
In the previous section we have seen that nouns can be derived from verb forms.
In this section I will survey the inventory and describe the word internal distributional
and functional properties of these affixal formatives that can occur within certain bases,
here called noun stems, to form a noun. The notion of ‘noun stem’ can be understood as
the nominal unit which results from adding the bound formatives described in this section
to a root base. I will refer to the bound formatives that attach to a root base to form a
noun stem as noun stem formatives. Thus, a noun stem is a root base plus one or more
noun stem formative(s).
As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, nouns can be grammatically
defined in terms of their syntactic and morphological properties. As follows from this
definition, morphological properties which are restricted to nouns distinguish them from
other parts of speech, and, moreover, this does not mean that nouns cannot share other
properties with other parts of speech, but rather that these shared properties cannot be
used to identify a word form as a noun morphologically.
As I have already anticipated in the previous chapter (under 3.4.1.1) I will NOT
make use of the notions of inflection or derivation (or its derived terms such as
inflectional or derivational morphemes/morphology...) for the simple reason that such
notions can only be defined on a theory internal basis. I will, nevertheless, make brief
comparisons, where especially relevant, between the language internally motivated
notions of noun stem morphology and noun morphology. Noun stem morphology
consists of the properties involved in the word formation of noun stems, whereas noun
morphology consists of the properties involved in the word formation of nouns and
216absent in the word formation of noun stems. In using perhaps typologically “un-userfriendly” labels I am trying to be coherent with the decision of favoring language internal
motivated labels where these may be at odds with more common terms found in the
typological literature. It is arguable whether noun stem morphology is “simpler” in any
way than noun morphology. However, the idea is not that the morphological forms that
occur with nouns are individually more complex that the morphological forms that occur
with noun stems (though arguments could also made in this direction), but rather that the
overall structure of nouns is more complex than that of noun stems. It is in this sense that
I will argue that, at least in a naïve sense, nouns are more complex than noun stems. One
way in which these terms will also prove useful is in avoiding the biases that notions such
as derivational and inflectional morphology would bring into the analysis of the Apurinã
noun morphology.
Finally, before describing the noun stem morphology, let me repeat for
convenience the cluster of evidence that will be (heuristically) used in the identification
of formatives (i.e. morphemes, their allomorphs or empty morphs). The properties listed
in Table 26 are repeated from Table 1 of chapter 3. I will only make explicit use of these
properties where the evidence is not overwhelmingly in favor of analyzing a formative as
a morpheme, allomorph or empty morph; otherwise, their use will be made implicitly (i.e.
I will use but not mention them):217Table 26: Defining Properties of Formatives

NO4.4.1 Gender Markers: Masculine -ru1 versus Feminine -ro
All nouns, including those derived from other categories, are either masculine or
feminine for the purpose of cross-referencing marking with other elements within a
syntactic construction. Masculine and feminine gender can be marked morphologically
or they can be morphologically unmarked. Unmarked masculine/feminine gender is the
one for which no formal grammatical marker is added to the verb. There are various
ways to tell the gender of an unmarked noun form in natural discourse, all involving a
coreferential formative found in the modifier, determiner or in the predicate. This is
illustrated in the following examples in (64a) and (64b), where in the first clause tata
‘“umari”’ cross-references the feminine pronominal object form in the verb, whereas in
the second clause yowata ‘knife’ cross-references the masculine pronominal object form
in the verb:21864a. ata nhika-ro tata
we eat-3F.O umari
‘We eat “umari”.’
b. nota atama-ru
yowata
I
look-3M.O knife
‘I saw the knife.’
Different from languages such as Portuguese and French, Apurinã does not show
cross-referencing between the elements inside nominal phrases, as the possessive
constructions in (65) illustrate:20
65a. uwa
yowata-ne
3SG.M knife-POSSED
‘his knife’
b. owa
yowata-ne
3SG.F knife-POSSED
‘her knife’
Nouns that are morphologically unmarked for gender constitute the majority of
the Apurinã nominal lexicon. They include sex-non-differentiable nouns such as those
listed in Table 27. As can be gathered from Table 27, the great majority of
morphologically unmarked noun stems referring to sex-non-differentiable elements is
assigned to the masculine gender.","[246, 247, 248, 249, 250]"
"8.1.2 Verb and the Object NP
Now that the structure of NP(obl)s have been motivated and their structure
described, it is worth inquiring whether there is any way that the verb plus the object NP
constitute a separate phrasal constituent, different from NP(obl)s. At the present time there
is no convincing positive evidence to argue that a verb plus the object NP form a phrasal
unit similar to, for example, the verb phrase (hereafter VP) in English or in other
languages where such a constituent can be motivated. The closest thing we can find to a
replacement test would consist of the replacement of the verb plus the NP object
construction by the verbal form txa described under 5.11.4. So, in (37a) suto ‘woman’ is
a NP subject of the clause, and nhika-ru nhipoko-ru1 ‘ate food’ is the predication about
the subject. In (37b) we see that the whole predication about the subject can be replaced
with the form txa-ru ‘do-3M.O’:
37a. suto
[nhika-ru [nhipoko-ru]NP ]?
woman eat-3M.O food-UNPOSS
‘The woman ate food.’
b. o-[txa-ru]
3F-do-3M.O
‘She did it.’
The use of txa-ru to replace an intransitive verb or a transitive verb plus its NP object is
common in the language. This particular use of txa-ru may be what led Aberdour
(1985:46) to label txa a “summary verb”, since in a way it sort of “summarizes” the
meaning of a predication previously expressed in the discourse. To the extent that txa is
462used anaphorically to express the meaning of a previous predicate, it could be argued to
serve as evidence, on the basis of the replacement test, for treating the verb plus NP
object construction as a VP. In the next example in (38), however, we see that the NP
expressing the notional object nhipokoru, that seemed to be internal to the predication in
(37a), occurs clause initially, without the addition of any phonological pause:
nhika
38. [nhipoko-ru]NP suto
food-UNPOSS woman eat
‘The woman ate food.’
The fact that the verb and the NP object can be separated by the NP subject needs to be
explained in order to maintain a VP analysis. It is possible that the clause initial NP
object illustrated in (38) is restricted to clauses that are somehow marked (structurally
and/or pragmatically) and derivable from clausal structures such as that represented by
(37a). However, such a markedness would still need to be established in the language.
The fact is that further evidence would need to be gathered in order to motivate a VP in
Apurinã. Traditional tests such as conjoined constructions are not found in the language
(as already noticed by Pickering 1974; see also discussion on juxtaposition in chapter 9,
in 9.2) and, thus, cannot be used as a constituency test for VPs. Without the firmer
support of other evidence, the predication will NOT be treated here as contained within a
VP, but rather as a V and a (structurally optional) NP object both as immediate
constituents of the clause.","[493, 494]"
"4708.3.1 Core Grammatical Relations
Core grammatical relations have been defined above both in terms of generally
taking the form of a NP to express arguments of a verb, as well as in terms of expressing
arguments that are required by the lexical meaning of the verb. The latter part of the
definition can be considered of greater importance, since, as will be seen later (8.3.1.2,
8.3.2.4 and 8.3.2.5), there are two subclasses of oblique grammatical relations that can be
encoded as NPs. There are two types of core grammatical relations that can be
distinguished on the basis of a cluster of properties associated with one but not the other
NPs expressing argument functions. These are referred to by the traditional labels
(grammatical) subject and (grammatical) object. As will be seen later, in section 8.9,
the distribution of clausal constituents in a sentence cannot be used as a defining criterion
for subject- and objecthood, since the position of such clausal constituents may vary in
ways that cannot be predicted on the basis of specific grammatical factors. That is, there
is enough variation in the order of clausal constituents so as to make it impossible to tell
whether a NP bears subject or object grammatical relation to the verb purely on the basis
of its position in a sentence. The data on clausal constituent order variation will be
systematically described in 8.9.
In earlier chapters, the notions that were referred to as “subject/object” were
preliminarily defined over the morphological co-referential pronominal markers that
occur on the verb. In motivating the notions of subject and object, it is counted as
evidence for the existence of subject certain syntactic behavior which are intrinsically
associated with the putative subject NPs and which the putative object NPs do not share.
The reverse is also true. These distinctions in behavior are taken to represent the
471realization of distinctive syntactic properties characterizing subject and object, and that
also single out grammatical relations as distinct from semantic or pragmatic ones.6
The evidence generally considered in defining subject can be characterized as one
of overt coding properties, behavior-and-control properties, or functional properties
(Givón 1995:228-252, adapted from Keenan 1976). Overt-coding properties are those
consisting of morphosyntactic distinctions between subject and object NPs; behaviorand-control properties are those consisting of syntactic operations (such as
reflexivization, relativization etc.) which one but not the other NP argument can undergo;
and functional properties consist of semantic, referential or pragmatic roles that can be
associated with one but not the other NP argument. Since the analytical goal here is to
determine whether subject and object can be distinguished syntactically, only overt
coding and behavior-and-control properties are considered as evidence here. Functional
properties, on the other hand, will be mentioned only to show that subject/object
grammatical relations cannot be reduced to purely semantic or pragmatic notions.
8.3.1.1Subject
It may be best to start by showing that subject cannot be identified/reduced to itsmost typical semantic or pragmatic correlate. Rather than illustrating the dissociation
between subject/object and each relevant semantic role, I will illustrate the dissociation
between subject/object and the semantic macroroles (Van Valin and LaPolla 1997:139146). The notion of “semantic macroroles” subsumes a number of specific semantic roles
on the basis of their meaning similarities and of how they are most often formally6Some of the major typological and theoretical discussions on grammatical relations that influenced the description
presented here are found in Van Valin and LaPolla 1997, Givón 1995:225:304, Croft 1990:95-123, Comrie
1989:104-123, Dryer 1986, Andrews 1985:62-164, DeLancey 1984, and Keenan 1976.","[501, 502, 503]"
"8.6.1 Tense
The tense grammatical category can be understood as “[t]he grammatical
expression of the time of a situation described in a proposition, relative to some other
time” (Crystal 1992:386). In a general sense, tense “locates the event in time” (Chung
and Timberlake 1985:202). It is this deitic/indexical nature inherent to tense that is
absent in the aspect category (described in 8.6.2 below). On the basis of its formal
marking properties, tense can described in terms to two types in Apurinã: future and
non-future. These two types of tenses have as reference center the speech locus (i.e. the
moment in which speech takes place).15
8.6.1.1Future
The future tense in Apurinã refers to a non-immediate time frame in the future(in relation to the speech locus), and is marked with the class3 bound form -ko
(morphologically described in 7.1.14). In (89a) the sentence expresses an imperative
speech act (described and defined in 8.8.3) where an advice is being given about the
behavior of the addressee in the time to come. In (89b) the sentence (extracted from a
folk Apurinã story) is uttered in a context where the speaker just realizes he is being
followed by hunters after his kidnapping of a woman; in this case future is used to refer15The description of tense presented here is restricted to its use in simple sentences. Tense resolution in complex
sentences is not included here.",[544]
"4.4.2 Possessed Markers: -te, -ne, -re1, and -re2
The possessed markers -te, -ne, and -re1 were described above in 4.1.2 as suffixes
that occur with alienable simple nouns, whereas the possessed marker -re2 was described
in 4.1.3 as a suffix that occurs with mixed simple nouns. Under the analysis presented
earlier, the choice of possessed markers is lexically determined. In the absence of further
specification, there are two possible interpretations of what it means here for possessed
markers to be lexically determined: It will either mean that (i) possessed markers are
assigned as part of the morphological properties associated with noun stems, or that (ii)
possessed markers are assigned in the lexicon (or at a different level in the lexicon, if
morphology is conceived inside the lexicon —depending on one’s morphological theory)
so that the information determining which possessed marker a noun base will take will be
part of the lexical meaning of the noun base (and not a result of any general grammatical
rule). In terms of the traditional derivational versus inflectional opposition made for
affixes in the morphological typology, possession marking is generally treated as an
inflectional category. In any analysis of -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2, these formatives will be
more inflectional or derivational-like depending on how one analyzes their morphological
status. In the next paragraphs I will describe these two possible analyses for possessed
228markers, and then will suggest a third analysis which will turn out to be a combination of
the first two.
In the first analysis possessed marking would be implemented as morphological
rules, and the formatives -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2 would be described as partially suppletive
allomorphs. If these possessed markers are analyzed as (partially suppletive) allomorphs
of the same morpheme, then they will be more like inflectional categories in other
languages, since they would simply constitute the allomorphic realization
(i.e. -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2, as determined by the morphological class of the noun they occur
with) of the morpheme {possessed}. In this first analysis speakers/hearers are assumed
to have a notion of the more abstract morpheme {possessed}, and the work of
implementing the phonological realization of {possessed} is left for the suppletive rules.
The rules in (70) represent the implementation of this first analysis:
70a. NSt → Rt + {possessed}
te
Rt

Rtne
b. Rt → Rt 
re1
Rtre2-te

-ne
c. {possessed} → -re 
1
-re2
(70a) states that a possessed noun stem is formed of a root plus the morpheme
{possessed}. (70b) specifies that the root base to which the morpheme {possessed}
attaches belongs to one of a set of four roots (i.e. Rtte, Rtne, Rtre1, or Rtre2) —which are
lexically marked to select one of the four partially suppletive forms of the morpheme229{possessed}. Finally, (70c) further specifies that the morpheme {possessed} can be
realized as -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2 —depending on the class of the root base (i.e. Rtte, Rtne,
Rtre1, or Rtre2) such a morpheme attaches to.
The first analysis just outlined is the descriptively least troublesome analysis to
the linguist because it makes use of suppletion to explain the various forms which
possessed marking takes, therefore exempting the analyst from providing unique meaning
or function to each of the suppletive forms. Such would be the case for the following
reason: In arguing that whether the {possessed} morpheme takes the form -te, -ne, -re1
or -re2 would be purely a matter of which morphological (arbitrary) class the base taking
this {possessed} morpheme belongs to we would also be giving up any possibility of
finding a semantic, phonological or syntactic motivation for the various possessed
markers in the language. Moreover, the fact that -te, -ne, -re1 and -re2 can all be
characterized as denoting one general meaning, namely ‘possessed’, is supportive of an
allomorphic analysis under partial suppletion. Notice, however, that the result of a
suppletive analysis of possessed markers in Apurinã would differ from, for example, a
suppletive analysis of go > went, be > am, is, are etc. in English. In go > went the
suppletion is grammatically motivated, since speakers/hearers only need to associate the
“irregular” forms with the past tense. In be > am, is, are etc., suppletion is also
grammatically motivated because speakers/hearers need to associate “irregular” forms
with the tense, person and number. In Apurinã, however, suppletive forms such as -te
> -ne > -re1 > -re2 would each need to be associated with an arbitrarily defined subset of
roots.
In the second analysis of possessed marking, possessed markers would be
conceived as satisfying the subcategorization constraints of subsets of roots in the same
230way as the gender (or noun class) markers do in languages where gender is lexically
(rather than semantically or phonologically) assigned. Some roots in Apurinã would
have the possessed markers assigned to them in a way similar to how masculine/feminine
gender is assigned to noun stems that take no overt gender marker in the language —as
described in the previous subsection. That is, under this analysis, the root form ããta
‘canoe(F)’ would subcategorize both to agree with the feminine gender (as in o-ye ããta
[F-PROX canoe] ‘this canoe’) and to take the -ne possessed marker (as in nota ããta-ne
[1SG canoe-POSSED] ‘my canoe’). An informal description of the meaning of the noun
root ããta could be represented as in (71):
 'canoe' 
71. ããta ‘FEMININE’
-ne


In this second analysis, each of the possessed markers would be analyzed as
independent morphemes whose information is recorded as part of the lexical entry of the
root they attach to. Each of the four possessed markers, by definition, would have
distinctive meaning and/or functional properties, if they are to be treated as morphemes.
Moreover, if the possessed markers -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2 are analyzed as different
morphemes that certain roots subcategorize for, then they will be more like derivational
morphological categories in other languages. This would be true to the extent that the
information about the morphological markers would, conceivably, be stored as part of the
lexical entry of the roots they occur with. In sum, in this second analysis,
speakers/hearers are assumed to subcategorize roots for taking -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2; the
information about the morphological realization of each of the possessed markers is built
as part of the lexical entry of certain lexically specified roots, and the work left to do is to
231provide meaning and/or function to each of the possessed markers as separate
morphemes. (72) presents the rule stating that the possessed noun stems are realized as a
subset of roots plus the possessed morphemes such roots are lexically specified to take:
te + te
Rt

Rtne + ne
72. NSt → Rt + re 
re1
1
Rtre2 + re2The major problem with the second analysis is in motivating an independent
morphemic status for each of the possessed markers -te, -ne, -re1 and -re2. In an earlier
attempt to make sense out of the use of these possessed markers in less arbitrary ways
(see Facundes 1995) I found that very intricate arguments can be explored in constructing
an account for possessed marking. Such arguments are partially grounded on information
of how genitive classifiers are used in other languages (as described in Carlson and
Payne 1989), on cross-linguistic properties of (in)alienability (as presented in Nichols
1988), on the notion of predicativity as it extends to nominal possession (as suggested in
Seiler 1983), and on iconicity principles as expressed in a notion of conceptual distance
(as presented in Chappell and McGregor 1989). The basic idea is that if possession
marking is conceived as a formal device used in some languages to express a
combination of conceptual distance between possessor and possessee, the functional or
social role of the possessee for the possessor, and degrees of predicativity between the
possessor and the possessee (as analogous to an argument and its verb), it may be
possible to assign some meaning to each of the possessed markers in Apurinã, perhaps
enough to consider them as distinct morphemes that are related in terms of having one
general meaning, i.e. possessed, but also different in terms of the type of possession they
232encode. In this manner, possessed markers would work in ways analogous to, for
example, the various morphemes for object that also inflect for person, since such
morphemes would have the general common property of marking object and, at the same
time, they would also have different properties in that they would also refer each to a
different person. So far, however, I have not been able to provide satisfactory
independent meaning/function for each of the possessed markers in order to motivate
their morphemic status.
The third analysis to be suggested here can be summarized as follows: First, the
possessed markers, in addition to carrying the meaning ‘possessed’, also function as the
morphological forms performing the marking patterns that motivate the notions of simple
alienable nouns and of simple mixed nouns (described in 4.1.2 and 4.1.3, respectively);
second, while the possessed markers -te, -ne, and -re1 are partial suppletive allomorphs of
a single morpheme whose meaning/function is ‘[possessed, alienable]’, the possessed
marker -re2 is a morpheme (different from -te, -ne, and -re1) whose meaning/function is
‘[possessed, mixed]’; and, third, ‘possessed’ refers to the property of being possessed,
‘alienable’ refers to the property of belonging to the (un)possession marking pattern
associated with simple alienable nouns (as described in 4.1.2), and ‘mixed’ refers to the
property of belonging to the (un)possession marking pattern associated with simple
mixed nouns (as described in 4.1.3). The examples in (73) illustrate the general meaning
properties of the root forms ããta and kota-, as they can be described following an
analysis in which the (un)possession marking patterns are generalized to become the
defining properties of alienable and mixed nouns, and constructed as part of the meaning
of these root forms:233 'canoe' 
73a. ããta ‘ FEMININE ’
ALIENABLE
 'basket' 
b. kota ‘MASCULINE’
 MIXED 
In (73a), ‘canoe’ is the content meaning of the root form ããta, whereas
‘FEMININE’ and ‘ALIENABLE’ are the grammatical meanings which this root
subcategorizes for. In (73b), ‘basket’ is the content meaning of kota-, whereas
‘MASCULINE’ and ‘MIXED’ are the grammatical meanings which this root
subcategorizes for. The word formation rules involving possessed markers can be
described as in (74) —revised later in (81):
RtALIEN + ALIEN

74a. NSt → Rt

MIXRtte 
b. RtALIEN → Rtne 
Rtre1
-te 
b’. ALIEN → -ne 
-re1
c. RtMIX → Rtre2
c’. MIX → -re2
(74a) states the generalization that a possessed noun stem will either consist of a
root lexically marked as [alienable] plus an alienable possessed marker, or of a root
lexically marked as [mixed] plus the mixed possessed marker. (74b) specifies the classes
of alienable roots that take the alienable possessed marker. (74b’) lists the alienable234markers which alienable roots select for. (74c) specifies the class of mixed roots that can
take the mixed possessed marker. Finally, (74c’) lists the mixed possessed marker which
mixed roots select for. Note, however, that the word formation represented in (74) only
takes into consideration the possessed markers. Since (in)alienability and mixing
possession marking have been defined over the morphological marking patterns found
both in possession and unpossession constructions, the word formation rule given in (74)
will need to be revised to include the unpossession marking patterns. This is done in the
next subsection.
The possessed markers in Apurinã are precisely the forms that have been
reconstructed for Proto-Maipuran (David Payne 1991:378-379). That would mean that,
in principle, the Apurinã possessed markers are at least a few thousand years old. It is
possible that only historical-comparative studies within the Maipuran family will provide
clearer evidence as to whether these different possessed markers originated in classifying
systems (e.g. genitive classifiers) or whether they arose through phonological processes
that are no longer transparent in Apurinã.
As an additional observation about possessed markers, I should recall a special
property of the possessed marker -re1. As was shown under 4.1.2, possessed markers
typically occur with a noun base or a bound root base. The qualifier “typically” is used
here precisely because one of the possessed markers, namely -re1, can also attach to verb
forms to derive a possessed noun. The general property of the possessed markers -te, -ne,
and -re2, as described in detail in 4.1.2-4.1.3 in the previous paragraphs, is simply to
mark a noun form as possessed and distinguish the class of alienable from the class of
mixed (and inalienable) nouns, with no other apparent meaning added to it. The
possessed marker -re1, in contrast, aside from being attached to free roots to derive
235possessed noun forms (as amply illustrated in (50) and in Table 18), can also be added to
verbs to derive noun stems, as illustrated in (75):
75a. tokatxi xika-re1
Tokatxi sing-POSSED‘Tokatxi’s song’b. ata kama-re1
1PL work-POSSED‘our work’c. uwa
yaxirika-re1
3SG.M tie-POSSED‘its/his knot’d. nota sãpaka-re1
1SG be.tired-POSSED‘my tiredness’The function of -re1, when it occurs attached to verbs, is to derive nouns generally
meaning ‘what you get/feel by V-ing’. That is, -re1 behaves as a sort of possessed object
nominalizer whose derived forms refer to possessed activities or states. To the extent that
at least one of the possessed markers can occur with verbs to derive nouns, they behave
as subcategory changing morphemes. Since -re1 is the only possessed marker that can
occur with verbs to nominalize them, and since it is restricted to a few verbs, it is likely to
constitute an innovation within the possession marking system.","[259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"
"7.3. The Category Status of Special Bound Formatives
The purpose of this subsection is to discuss the arguments to be constructed on the
basis of the data presented so far (but not yet systematically discussed as to what they
mean) for treating special bound formatives as a special category of morphological units.
While such special morphological units can be shown to resemble the more typical affix
units (as the ones described in chapters 4-6) in terms of their distribution in the base they
attach to, they can, nonetheless, be distinguished from typical affixes in at least two
ways: first, in terms of their positioning outside of the more typical affixal morphology
described in chapters 4-6, and, second in terms of their “floating” distribution in the
clause and/or the way in which they interact with phrasal or clausal constructions. The431analysis of the status of special bound formatives as an extension of morphological
strategies (rather than as a result of purely syntactic operations) has a twofold motivation:
On the one hand, it follows from my perception of a general trend in Apurinã, namely to
make use of morphological strategies to encode functions that apply at the level of the
phrase or clause; and, on the other hand, it is partly inspired in Anderson (1992, and
references there cited, especially chapter 8) —although I do not make use of the formal
descriptive language nor necessarily of all axioms that accompany that framework. The
discussions in chapter 8 of Spencer 1991 and in chapter 3 of Sadock 1991 were also
helpful in organizing the content of this section.
I have so far intentionally avoided making use of the term “clitics” here due to the
various meanings associated with it, and have chosen instead to work with languagespecific labels. As a consequence, the distinctions being made here are clearly motivated
by language internal factors. After all, as Sadock points out, “[t]he elements we call
clitics are often characterized by a constellation of properties from diverse grammatical
realms”, among which he lists the following:
58. Sample of wide range of properties associated with clitics, as given by Sadock (1991:52):
“I. Morphology
a. Clitics are bound morphemes.
b. They attach outside inflection.
c. They block further morphology.
d. They attach without regard to the morphological class of the host.
e. They are completely productive.
II. Syntax
a. Clitics are independent elements of syntax.
b. They are syntactically adjacent to their morphological host.
III. Semantics
a. Clitics are semantic functions.
b. They take the meaning of a phrase as argument.
IV. Phonology
a. Clitics are phonologically dependent.
432b. They are agglutinative.
c. They are stressless.
d. They are subject to automatic phonological rules only.
V. Lexicon
a. Host plus clitic forms are not lexicalized.
b. Clitics alternate with free words.”
Clitics are defined over the property that some word-like elements have of being
prosodically deficient. Among the various attempts to establish a typology of clitics, the
one most often referred to in the literature is by Zwicky (1977). Zwicky classifies clitics
into three types: simple clitics, special clitics, and bound words. A simple clitic “is an
element of some basic word class, which appears in a position relative to the rest of the
structure in which the normal rules of the syntax would (or at least could) put it”
(Anderson 1992:200). A special clitic “is one whose position within some phrasal unit is
determined by principles other than those of the non-clitic syntax” (Anderson 1992:201202). Bound words “are the words which don’t correspond to a full form and thus can’t
possibly be analyzed as reductions of ‘real’ words, but which nevertheless need a host
and in some cases are restricted to a particular sentence position” (Spencer 1991:376).
Perhaps the best candidate for a simple clitic among the special bound formatives
are the subject/possessor pronominal markers as well as the object pronominal markers.
The special property of the subject/possessor pronominal markers (including here the
plural marker, described in 7.1.13, that is in dependency relation with the third person
plural subject/possessor marker), as shown in 7.1.1, is that they are in complementary
distribution with coreferential pre-verbal nominal expression bearing the subject in a
clause or the possessor in a possession construction. So, these pronominal forms are able
to replace nominal expressions in some specific distributional and functional contexts,
namely as pre-verbal subject free expression or as possessor free expression. However,
433one first difference from simple clitics is that the pronominal markers, when used as
subject or as object markers, are in complementary distribution ONLY with pre-verbal
free coreferential nominal expressions, but NOT with postverbal free coreferential
nominal expressions (as shown in 7.1.1 and in 7.1.12). Another difference is that,
although the phonological similarity between subject/possessor pronominal markers and
independent pronouns is quite clear, they have partially different functions, since while
the former can only be used with subject or possessor function, the latter can be used with
subject, object or possessor function, as represented in Table 6:

unawaWhile independent pronouns can bear subject as well as object grammatical
relations, or yet bear the possessor relation (as described in detail in chapter 6, in section
6.1), the subject/possessor pronominal markers can be used to bear the subject or the
possessor, but NOT the object (as described earlier in 7.1.1). Since independent
pronouns and bound pronominal markers show some partial distinction in their
grammatical meaning, the latter cannot be described as phonological reductions of the
former —although there is likely to be a diachronic link between the two sets of
pronominal forms. Therefore, subject/possessor pronominal markers cannot be described
as simple clitics, that is, as simple phonological reductions of the independent pronouns.","[462, 463, 464, 465]"
"8.10.4 Constituent Order Resolution in Potentially Ambiguous Sentences
In Facundes 1994 I described clauses with no bound pronominal markers attached
to the verb. In principle, unless semantics or discourse-pragmatics made it clear who the
subject or object was, such clauses would be ambiguous as to their interpretation of who
did what to whom. In clauses such as the following in (145), semantics and/or discoursepragmatics would suffice to provide the correct interpretation of the clause. This is true
since ‘I ate the food’ expresses a trivial and natural event. ‘The food ate me,’ on the
other hand, would require a conception rather distinct from the way the event of ‘eating’
is normally conceived in the Apurinã world of natural events —which, of course, could
be licensed by the specific context of mythological stories but less likely in the context of
everyday language.

Clauses such as those in (146) could have a default interpretation in which the
man is thought to be a hunter, and, since more stories are about the hunters than about the
hunted animals, the hunter would more typically be interpreted as the subject of the
clause. Here however, one just needs to change the perspective of the person uttering the
clause (to, e.g., one in which the tapir escaped because it saw the man and ran away) for
the second interpretation to be more natural. That is, a minor addition of contextual
specific information here would suffice to change the default interpretation.

In the next example in (147), however, there is nothing semantically or
pragmatically associated with Mipatu or Mipake to make either of them ‘the one who
sees’ or ‘the one who is seen.’ There is no pragmatic default interpretation, as far as I can
tell, that can be associated with Mipatu or Mipake, as the two individuals are cousins who
live in the same village. Thus, in this example, neither semantics nor a default pragmatic
interpretation can be used as clues as to what the correct interpretation of the clause is. In
553Facundes (1994a), I used similar data to argue that OSV was the default interpretation for
examples that lack semantics or default pragmatic properties that could resolve the
ambiguity. Indeed, it is true that some speakers choose OSV as default interpretation
when ambiguity cannot be resolved by semantics and pragmatics. However, now it is
also clear that the strategy used to resolve ambiguity varies across different speakers. I
have not been able to confirm OSV as default order for more than a handful of speakers.","[583, 584, 585]"
"Predicate Marking: -ka4
The predicate marker -ka4 occurs attached to word bases that are used aspredicators. Such word bases include (at least) verb bases, noun bases, pronoun bases,
numeral bases, and particle bases. With nouns, pronouns or particles, -ka4 functions as
non-verbal predicate marker, attaching to the head of such a non-verbal predicate
397construction. The examples in (24) illustrate -ka4 with non-verbal predicate
constructions:
24a. popũka-ru-ka4-ra-no
Apurinã-F-PRED-FOC-1SG.O
‘I (really) am Apurinã.’
b. watxa-ka4-ra-ko
ADV.PTC-PRED-FOC-FUT
‘(It) will really be today/now.’
c. hãt-u-ka4-ra-ko
one-M-PRED-FUT
‘(It) will be one.’
d. uwa-putu-ka4-ma-ra-ko
3SG.M-EMPH-PRED-FRUSTR-FOC-FUT
‘(It) would be him but….’
When attached to verb bases, -ka4 has no apparent grammatical meaning or
function, working simply as an optional “filler” or empty formative. I call it “predicate”
marker because it occurs with non-verbal bases when these are in predicate position.
With verbs it can follow the perfectivity markers (as in 20-23), the class2 formatives
habitual, hypothetical, or imminent markers (described in chapter 5), the emphasis
marker (as in 16b), or certain verbal roots, as in (25b) below. The example in (25a)
shows that iri ‘to fall’ is a free verb root (otherwise iri could not take a subject/possessor
pronominal marker and, also, precede a free subject form coreferential with the
pronominal marker); (25b) shows -ka4 following a free verbal root. Note that the
meaning difference between (a) and (b) in (25) is due to the presence/absence of the
perfective marker, and not to the presence/absence of -ka4:39825a. nh-iri-pe
nota
3M-fall-PFTV 1SG
‘I’ve fallen down.’
b. nh-iri-ka4
nota
1SG-fall-PRED 1SG
‘I fell down.’
There are rare clear cases of -ka4 attaching directly to a free verb root such as iri
‘to fall’. There is some evidence that /#irika#/ used to be an unanalyzable form, and that
iri results from a reanalysis of /#irika#/ into /#iri+ka#/. Such a reanalysis would be
motivated by a phonological process of root shortening similar to suka > su ‘to go’,
umaka > uma ‘to sleep’ and so on that happens in natural discourse. iri would be then the
result of a root shortening process that nowadays happens often enough to lead
speakers/hearers to reanalyze it as a full free verbal root. I will not attempt to describe
here such a reanalysis, nor the root shortening phonological process involved in it, simply
because it is still a rather preliminary analysis which still requires a more systematic
verification of the relevant data.
The reason to say that -ka4 carries no grammatical meaning or function when
attached to verbs is that whatever verb bases it occurs with no meaning is
added/subtracted by its presence/absence, and, moreover, its presence is optional, as the
next examples in (26) show (in these examples parentheses indicate that the form is
optional):4
26a. owa
txita-pi-(ka4)
3SG.F fight-HAB-(PRED)
‘She is always fighting.’4In some speech varieties, however, -ka seems to be in a dependency relation with the morphemes -pi, -napano, and
-putu such that it cannot be omitted when co-occurring with any of these morphemes.","[428, 429, 430]"
"7.1. The Meaning/Function of Special Bound
Formatives
The following subsections describe briefly the meaning and functional properties
of the various types of special bound formatives. More detailed description of the
meaning/function of these formatives will be provided in chapter 9, in the appropriate
syntactic contexts. As will be seen in the various subsections below, the grammatical
functions associated with special bound formatives do not yield other word
(sub)categories; instead, they more often add grammatical meanings that are overtly378reflected in the noun phrase or in the clause, thus being inflection-like formatives. The
order of presentation of each formative follows their internal distribution in the word base
they attach to. This distribution will be summarized in terms of position classes in 7.2.
I should also note that in various subsections below one may feel the need to ask
why certain forms are described as morphological units (rather than syntactic ones) when
they are clearly associated with predicates, phrases, clauses or even discourse functions.
The answer to this question follows from the definition of word and the domain of
morphology as described for Apurinã in chapter 3. In its relevant definition, a word can
be as complex as a phrase or clause; in fact, a word can stand syntactically as a phrase or
as a clause. However, since the primary goal of morphology is to describe the structure
of words, words need to be morphologically described even when they can stand by
themselves as a phrase or clause. This in no way means that all formatives which are
morphologically described cannot be syntactically described as well, or even described as
to their discourse functions. To the contrary, such formatives are only morphologically
described insofar as their place in the word needs to be established. Their precise
function, however, in some cases can only be properly described within the syntactic or
discourse domain. With this in mind, we can now proceed to analyze the
meaning/functional properties of special bound formatives.","[409, 410]"
"481.4. Methodology and Theoretical Framework
The methodology used in this study belongs to the field of descriptive linguistics.
In its major parts, however, the description is theoretically informed. By “theoretically
informed” I mean that the concepts used in the analysis as well the results of parts that
are considered major pieces of the grammar are discussed in light of what is known in the
general linguistic literature. In this sense, the description is also, in general, somewhat
typologically informed. Where concepts not generally used in the literature are
presented, they are defined on the basis of evidence found in the language. I have
attempted to ensure that important concepts whose definition may tend to vary according
to authors and/or linguistic theories/frameworks/models be always defined, and that
references be made to other places in the literature where such concepts (or analogous
ones) can be found.
As no descriptive work can be completely atheoretical, this study also has its
biases. On the definitions of categories based on functional, behavioral or discoursepragmatic properties, the tendency is to follow ideas developed in functional, typological
and cognitive linguistics. On the other hand, the definitions based on structural
properties are generally influenced by the methodology used in the field of structuralist
linguistics (without much of the more theory-specific machinery more recently
introduced in generative linguistics). The motivation for using ideas from one or the
other field is based on where the best definition is found which best accounts and
explains the data. It happens that, in my view, the methodology for the analysis of
functional, behavioral or discourse-pragmatic categories is generally best developed in
functional, typological and cognitive linguistics; whereas the methodology for the
49analysis of structural properties (such as constituency) are best developed in structuralist
linguistics. This difference should follow from the distinct emphases and assumptions of
each approach. Authors representing one or the other field are cited in the relevant
sections. For every major analytical case, the references are also made to indicate which
approach the methodology may be more akin to. What is avoided in this study, however,
is the use of assumptions restricted to very specific theories (such as GB, Principles and
Parameters, Minimalism, Optimality Theory etc.). This avoidance results from the
general ephemeral character of such formal theories, what would tend to lead this study
to become obsolete in the same way that these formal approaches tend to —sooner rather
than later. Instead, the grammar is described in terms of what are clearly important parts
of the Apurinã grammar and that any theory that attempts to describe such a grammar
will be likely to need to account for. Moreover, not much concern is shown in this work
for comparing the Apurinã language grammar to other Arawak languages. The reason is
that, as a first detailed grammatical treatment of Apurinã, the linguistic analysis presented
in this work is meant to be language internally based. That is, there is no instance where
a phonological or grammatical category is posited on the basis of its being attested in
other Arawak languages. While this may seem frustrating for some scholars of Arawak
languages, it constitutes an attempt to portray the language as it can seen looking at it
from inside out. Once this analysis has been made available, typological studies within
(or outside) Arawak can obviously be more easily done without the risk that the
description of Apurinã is heavily biased by our knowledge of other Arawak languages.
As it turns out, it is naturally possible that certain aspects of the linguistic analysis
presented here may be changed once comparisons have been made with other Arawak
languages. This, however, remains to be shown on an empirical basis.
50In a review of a descriptive grammar, Dixon (1998) referred to the general
framework appropriate to the development of a linguistic description as “Basic Linguistic
Theory”. Such a theory is defined by Dixon as “the cumulative theoretical framework for
linguistic description as it has developed over the last two thousand years and more”
(507). Although, some theory specific theoretical biases may still be found in some
places in this work, especially in determining what deserves less or more attention in the
language grammar, my general aim is to work with this “cumulative theoretical
framework for linguistic description” that Dixon refers to, and portray the Apurinã
language, as much as possible, on the basis of language internal motivating factors.","[79, 80, 81, 82]"
"5228.6.2.2Imperfective
Imperfective can be roughly defined as the aspect that “views the situation not asa bounded whole, but rather from within, with explicit reference to its internal structure
(Bybee et al 1994:125, based on Comrie 1976:24). Or, in different terms, imperfective
can be understood as the aspect that signals the absence of closure of an event (Chung
and Timberlake 1985:219). Different from perfectivity, subtypes of imperfectivity take
different morphological markers. The following subsections describe the various types of
imperfective aspects found in the language.
8.6.2.2.1Incompletive ImperfectiveThe incompletive (imperfective) is when the imperfective form is used to mark
situations that do not come to a completion (either because they ended incomplete or
because they never even started to happen). The morphological form marking
incompletive aspect is the class3 bound form -panhi (morphologically described in
7.1.6.2). In (101a) the speaker tells the addressee that he (the speaker) has never been to
the place that they are talking about. The imperfective marker is added to the predicate to
mark that the event of ‘going to a specific place does not come into being.’ In (101b) the
same speaker tells the same addressee that both of then ‘still’ will be able to go to such a
specific place. In this latter case, the incompletive marker is used to mark the event as of
‘going to the specific place as incomplete because in another time period it (the event)
will come into being’. Notice that while (101a) is used in the past, (101b) is used in the
future, though both being incomplete:523LOC s-V-IMPFTV

The additional examples in (102) show that stative situations can also be marked
for “incompletion”. The example in (102a) is a non-verbal clause marked with the
incompletive form. In (102b), although the clause has a verbal predicator with an
intransitive subject, this predicator is semantically stative. As these examples illustrate,
for a state to be marked as incompletive it means that the state expressed by the stative
predicate does not come to an end:

“views an action as at reference time” (Bybee 1994:127). In other words, situations are
viewed as in progress within a temporal frame that, in principle, could be located in the
past, present or future. The progressive aspect is marked with the class1 bound form
-nanu (morphologically described in 5.2.1.1.1.7). In (103a) the event expressed by the
524predicate is about ‘eating the “uxi” fruit’, a situation that was progressing during an
undetermined time period in the past. In (103b) the predicate is about ‘causing somebody
to sell a lot of something’, and the progressive event is located at an undetermined time
period in the future. In (103c) the predicate is about ‘the fall of somebody’ that is in
progress at the present time. In (103d) the predicate is about ‘sleeping’, and is also
located in the present time. Finally, (103e) is given to show that descriptive verbs cannot
take the progressive form:

The fact that descriptive verbs, that is, those generally expressing properties, do
not occur in the progressive in the language suggests that the opposition between
eventive/process/dynamic verbs versus stative/state/descriptive verbs is reflected in the
525Apurinã aspectual system. However, more research on the lexical semantics of verbs in
this language is required to determine which other restrictions may apply to the different
verb classes. At the present time, it still is not possible to determine reliably whether
there are any non-descriptive verbs that also share similar restrictions with the descriptive
ones, or the converse. Furthermore, in terms of Comrie’s (1976) definitions, what is
being called progressive in Apurinã is not a continuative aspect. For Comrie, the
distinction between the two would be that the latter would also occur with
stative/states/descriptive verbs.18
8.6.2.2.3HabitualAs a general definition, habitual marks “situations that are customarily repeated
on different occasions” (Bybee et all 1994:127). What is being called habitual aspect
here is a form of imperfective that marks events as part of a habit that the subject
participant has; the habitual marker is the class2 bound form -pi (morphologically
described in 5.2.1.2.1.5). In (104a) the event described is about ‘an opossum that has the
bad habit of coming to the speaker’s backyard to eat chickens’. In (104b) the speaker
tells of ‘his habit of planting things’; here the habitual marker co-occurs with the
progressive marker. Finally, in (104c) the event could be about ‘somebody that is already
fat enough but still maintains the habit of eating very often’. In all cases in which the
habitual marker is used, there is a sense in which the predicate marked as habitual occurs
more often than it may be naturally expected or desired (if desired at all).1918But see discussion in Bybee et al 1994:137-139, section 5.4, and references there cited, for the possible typological
inadequacy of Comrie’s classification.","[553, 554, 555, 556, 557]"
"Perfectivity Marking: -pe, -panhi
There are two perfectivity markers that can attach to noun bases, pronoun basesor verb bases, namely the perfective and imperfective aspectual markers. One can argue
that aspectual markers should NOT be considered as part of the noun or pronoun
morphology, since the scope of such a marker is the event/state rather than the referent of394the noun or pronoun in question. Or, conversely, one can argue that word bases taking
perfectivity markers are not noun or pronoun forms since they take marking forms
associated with the event/state expressed in the verb. Although, in a general sense, both
arguments could be correct in other languages (or in Apurinã under a different view of
the domain of morphology), the fact is that the word forms described below as taking
aspectual markers fit the definition of grammatical words given in chapter 3, regardless
of their translation into English. In other words, there is no reason to think that
perfectivity markers make a noun or a pronoun into a verb. In the following subsection, I
will merely illustrate some examples of noun, pronoun and verb bases marked with
perfectivity markers. I will return to the discussion of perfectivity markers in chapter 8,
in 8.6.2, where I will provide a more detailed description of the semantics of perfectivity
markers. In translating clauses marked with perfectivity markers, I will use the English
perfective form have V-ed to translate the perfective marking, and the English form
still/yet to translate the imperfective marking. Although this does not constitute a
“perfect” translation of the perfectivity markers, it covers some of their most typical
meanings —which will be described in detail in chapter 8.6.2.

"1.6. Apurinã and Linguistic Typology
Apurinã has typical properties of a polysynthetic language insofar as it has a rich
system of grammatical functions expressed by means of bound morphemes —not only
the functions typologically expressed by grammatical morphemes across many languages
but also functions typologically expressed by lexical morphemes. Different, however,
from many of the polysynthetic languages of North America, Apurinã is more of an
agglutinative (rather than fusional) type language; the language has a (C)(V)V syllable
structure, and morphophonological alternations are basically restricted to proclitic-like
pronominal markers and to a few other verb bound forms.
The language has characteristics of a head-marking type language in having, for
instance, cross-referencing markings on verbs and possession markers on the head
possessed noun. The rich morphology of this language does not at all imply the lack of
syntactic operations; instead, it simply means that many grammatical functions are
formally encoded in the morphosyntax, i.e. they are expressed by forms that partially
obey morphological rules as to their distribution, but syntactic conventions as to their use
and allocation in the clause. As to clausal constituent order, the language is52predominantly OV in terms of its word order corelations, although the most frequent
order in text is VO. The language also has a gender system based on the
feminine-masculine grammatical distinction, a morphologically marked noun class
system based on alienable versus inalienable possession, and an incipient noun
classification system consisting of nouns with classificatory functions that recur as part of
a productive noun compounding system.","[83, 84]"

Thus, once we have added CN2s to the typology of classifying systems, it comes
as no surprise to note DeLancey’s suggestion of the existence of a continuum from pure
noun to pure classifier, and that such continuum can be observed in the syntactic and
semantic behavior of certain nouns and classifiers. Such a continuum has been attested in
the form of class terms in some South-East Asian languages. CN2s in Apurinã then
would constitute another manifestation of similar continuum, this time in an Amazonian
language.
4.1.1.2.4Remarks on the Semantic Nature of C(lassificatory)N(oun)2sIn the previous sections we have seen that Apurinã has CN2s; that CN2s are the
recurrent elements in productive noun compounding; that some CN2s can be used as
anaphor-like nominal elements that can be incorporated into the verb in a manner similar
to certain verb incorporated classifiers; and that CN2s play important grammatical roles in187the morphology, syntax and the lexicon of the language, as well as that they can
encompass important discourse and pragmatic roles.
In the analysis presented above for CN2s, I have suggested that there is enough
synchronic evidence pointing toward a continuum within which the nature of CN2s can
be understood. When we look at CN2s in productive compounding by isolating parts of
this continuum based on observable differences in their semantic or syntactic behavior,
we identify parts of the mechanisms by which lexical meaning “emerges” as a result of
language use and language variation. In terms of their semantic properties, we have seen
that CN2s have two sources currently attested: most CN2s derive from plant parts/nature
elements, and a few others derive from body parts. The fact, however, that there are too
few instances of the latter cases does not allow us to discard the possibility that further
investigation may reveal that all CN2s have plant parts/nature elements as source
meanings. Moreover, CN2s occur as one of the elements in a productive noun compound
and they refer to anatomical properties of the derived meaning of the compound. Thus,
CN2s may refer to semantic properties of nouns which fall into two or three of the
following meaning categories: (i) plant parts/nature elements (as source meaning), (ii)
body parts (as derived meaning and, perhaps, also as source meaning), (iii) manufactured
elements (as derived meaning).
Based on the descriptive information above, two important questions can be asked
about CNs:
I - What is the motivation which may lead the same CN2s with the semantic field
in (i) to be used to refer to the semantic field in (ii) and/or in (iii), or those with the
semantic field in (ii) to refer to the semantic field in (iii)? Furthermore, can we say188anything on why the source semantic field is (i) rather than (ii), when the converse seems
to be more well attested crosslinguistically?
II - In terms of the semantic internal structure of CN2s, which are the semantic
properties that are preserved or abandoned as CN2s have their meaning extended with
accompanying semantic bleaching?
The semantic development of CNs suggests a number of semantic changes that
can be explained through metaphorical extensions of particular source meanings into
particular target meanings. One type of semantic change observed was that which occurs
when plant parts have their meaning extended to refer to body parts. In contrast, another
semantic change occurs with the extension of meaning from plant parts to manufactured
elements. For instance, there is a sense in which the use of -muna in ãã-muna ‘tree’ is
different from its use in kiri-muna ‘animal’s nose’; and the use of -muna in aiko-muna
‘house bean’ is different from both of the previous uses. In the first case, -muna refers to
the properties of a plant; in the second case, -muna refers to the properties of a body part;
and in the third case, -muna refers to the properties of a manufactured element. Is it the
case that, in the three cases, -muna carries the same meaning properties? If yes, then
what are these meaning properties? Are the various uses of -muna a case of polysemy or
homonyny?
As Sweetser points out “[n]o historical change of meaning can take place without
an intervening stage of polysemy. If a word once meant A and now means B, we can be
fairly certain that speakers did not just wake up and switch meanings on June 14, 1066.
Rather, there was a stage when the word meant both A and B, and the earlier meaning of
A eventually was lost” (1991:9). In that view, -muna could be, conceivably, treated as an
instance of polysemy. Now, does this help us answer question I or II posited above?
189How can we show that each instance of -muna in words like ãã-muna ‘tree,’ aiko-muna
‘house beam,’ kiri-muna ‘animal nose’ etc... corresponds to different word meanings that
happen to be expressed in the language by the same phonological form? If we followed a
strict version of the polysemy view, we would end up having to accept a lexicon
consisting of lexical entries such as -muna1, -muna2, -muna3, -muna4, -muna5 etc... which
when applied to the other CN2s of the language would generate a close to infinite number
of lexical meanings the language learner would need to memorize. This certainly is not a
desirable result. If on the other, we assume that there is enough similarities among the
various uses of -muna that justifies to treat them as semantically related in some way, we
find ourselves in the position of having to show which “similarities” those are.
Question I could be answered if we made use of the some sort of cultural mode
underlying the use of CN2s. We may take CN1s (i.e. plant parts/nature elements and
perhaps body parts) to constitute the set of semantic properties expressing a source
domain, whereas CN2 (manufactured elements) would constitute a target domain. In
order to understand, express or conceptualize elements within the target domain,
elements of the source domain are used. The meaning of CN2s would emerge out of the
mappings between image-schematic models containing “specific schematic images,
such as trajectories or long, thin shapes or containers” (Lakoff 1986:31). There would be
three of such image-schematic models involved here, one for (i) plant parts/nature
elements, another for (ii) body parts and, finally, a third for (iii) manufactured elements.
These mappings could be characterized as metaphoric mappings within a metaphoric
model (idem), in which elements from one image-schematic model maps onto another
one, as (i) maps onto (ii), (i) maps onto (iii), and (ii) maps onto (iii), as in the diagrams
below:

ELEMENTSFig. 6: From Body Parts to Manufacture Elements
Apurinã then would have conceptual mappings of a sort that motivate the
meaning alternation of CN2s. As a first approximation, Apurinã could be said to have the
following global conceptual metaphoric mapping:
THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ANIMAL BODIES/MANUFACTURED
ELEMENTS ARE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PLANT PARTS OR
NATURE ELEMENTS.
Fig. 7: Generic Metaphoric Model
A version of such a conceptual metaphorical mapping in Apurinã could be
grounded on the Apurinã cosmology wherein plants and non-human animals are treated
as the same sort of beings —as attested in the Apurinã creation mythology. Thus, what
we would be finding is that there would be a generic metaphoric model embedded into an
Apurinã idealized cultural model (or an Idealized Cognitive Model, see Lakoff 1987)
which would work to motivate the use of certain semantic domains in connection with
other semantic domains, in this case, the semantic domain of plant parts/nature elements
191in connection with that of body parts (Fig. 4), or of plant parts/nature elements in
connection with that of manufactured elements (Fig. 5), or the semantic domain of body
parts in connection with that of manufactured elements (cf. Fig. 6). Within this semantic
analysis, CN1 and CN2 can be treated as items that constitute a natural category (see
Lakoff 1982); their commonality consists of the similarities perceptually identifiable in
their semantic contribution to the derived compound noun, such similarities consisting of
shape and/or consistency. Physical shape and consistency are the general set of semantic
features making an anatomical image-schematic model that, once made available to the
speakers, can be extensively used with CN2s with functions beyond that of a simple head
of a noun compound. That is when CN2s can be used as modifying elements with
attributive function in nouns or in verb incorporation.
In order to answer question II, we need a more detailed analysis of the semantic
features (properties) of CN2s; we need to specify the shape and consistency properties
involved in the mappings posited in Figures (4-6). In order to motivate the properties of
CN2s in terms of image-schematic mappings, we need to specifically describe which
particular properties are being mapped between domains. That is, it still remains to be
said which of the several different “physical properties of Plant Parts/Nature Elements”
are associated to the “physical properties of Body Parts/Manufactured Elements,” and so
on. This is what is dealt with in the next paragraphs.
A semantic analysis of the data allows us to make sense out of the descriptive
facts by positing schematic models which would motivate the association of the semantic
fields given in (i)-(iii) above. Such an analysis also allows us to note that it is the
perceptually salient physical properties inherent to (i) and/or (ii) that are mapped onto (ii)
and/or (iii). However, we have only been able to account for the semantic classes whose
192properties are associated to one another (through metaphorical mappings), and to
motivate only one very general set of properties involved in the semantic mappings,
namely the set of “physical salient properties.” The obvious question then would be
“How do we know which properties are salient?” One way to find the answer to this
question would be to perform psycholinguistic experimental tests such as those used in
Prototype studies à la Rosch 1977. Another possibility would be to use linguistic
information through a structural analysis of the data. It is the structural analysis that
follows below.
The CN2 -muna can be used to illustrate how the data presented in the paper
indicate that it is that the most salient features inherent to the source domain (i.e. CN1)
turn out to be preserved in the target domain (i.e. CN2). As we have already seen
above, -muna can only be used with plant parts names (when used with the plant
parts/nature elements category) to refer to trees with large trunks. It is generally the case
that such large trunks have as salient perceptible properties the fact that they are ‘thick,’
‘rigid,’ and ‘cylindrical’. Hence ‘thick,’ ‘rigid’, and ‘cylindrical’ can be naturally
interpreted as the salient source meaning properties of the CN2 -muna. Now, having
established the source salient properties of -muna, we can examine which of such
properties remain or are lost when -muna is used to refer to body parts or manufactured
elements. As seen in the Table 13 below, the ‘rigid’ property is lost when used to refer to
body parts, but maintained when used to refer to manufactured elements. Thus, the
recurring properties of -muna across categories are ‘thick’ and ‘cylindrical’.
In Table 13, I extend the analysis for each CN2 in order to illustrate the recurring
properties which can be observed when CN2s refer to the shape or consistency of plant
parts/Nature Elements, body parts, and manufactured elements. Hence, in Table 13 we
193track the original salient properties for each CN2 as such properties are preserved or lost
when the CN2s are used with any of the relevant noun categories. As a result, we arrive
at the (presumed) “core” properties, that is, meanings that may recur across categories, as
summarized in Table 14.
Thus, in Table 14 the “core” properties can conceivably be taken to be the
specific features which are mapped from the source to the target domains which were
represented in Figs. 4-6.","[217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225]"

Causal or reason subordination occurs when the adverbial subordinator particlekotxi ‘because’ precedes the subordinate clause to express the cause/reason for what is
said in the matrix clause. The clause preceded by kotxi then functions as subordinate to
the matrix clause. The following examples are instances of complex sentences where the
subordinate clause is marked with the adverbial subordinator particle kotxi. As the
examples in (54) show, the subordinate clause can both precede or follow the matrix
clause:

Temporal subordination is one where the subordinate clause locates temporallythe situation described in the matrix clause. A bound temporal subordinate clause is
marked with the addition of the temporal adverbial bound morpheme -sawaku to the
subordinate clause. Temporal subordinate clauses can also precede and follow the matrix

because it also constitutes a major type of speech act. The following examples in (56) are
repeated from subsection 8.8.1.2. These clauses are subordinate insofar as they cannot
stand by themselves as a sentence as result of having the frustrative marker -ma.

The other way that clauses can be combined in Apurinã is through juxtaposition.
The notion of juxtaposition is a rather straightforward one: It differs from subordination
in that it consists of clustering two independent clauses (i.e. simplex sentences) with no
formal marking. The examples in (57) illustrate various juxtaposed sentences:

The example in (57a) is an instance of juxtaposition where both verbs are intransitive; in
(57b) the first clause has an intransitive verb, and the second a transitive one; in (57c) the
first clause has a transitive verb and the second an intransitive one; and in (57d) both
clauses have transitive verbs. Where the semantics of the verbs in the clauses being
conjoined does not make it clear, the default interpretation is that the event that occurs
first is the one expressed in the first sentence.","[640, 641, 642, 643]"
"4.4.8 Other Processes of Noun Stem Formation
In addition to the noun stem formations given above there are others, less
productive or of more limited use in the language. The first one is realized through some
sort of “reduplication” of onomatopoeic forms, where the derived nouns refer to the
animal or phenomenon that produces certain sounds, and where the phonology of these
nouns results from an iconic representation of such sounds. As the examples in (98)
illustrate, the appearance of reduplication is a result of the way speakers/hearers represent
what they hear; it does not constitute true reduplication in that the forms that result from
separating the formally similar parts of these onomatopoeias do not stand as formatives
that can be found as part of other words:25098a. mẽko-mẽko-ru1
mẽko-mẽko-3SG‘thunder’b. toro-toro
toro-toro‘type of big frog’c. nhao-nhao
nhao-nhao‘type of large seagull’Another process included here for forming noun stems where some partial
regularity can be found involves certain proper names assigned to women. A few proper
names for women coincide in ending in /ero/, as the examples in (99) are illustrative of:
99a. irarĩero
wild.pig.F‘(woman´s name)’b. komarĩero‘(woman´s name)’c. yakonero‘(woman´s name)’d. mayoripero‘(woman´s name)’e. mirĩero‘(woman´s name)’f. nanãxiero‘(woman´s name)’g. nainero‘(woman´s name)’h. irĩero‘(woman´s name)’Notice that, aside from /ro/ in /ero/ coinciding with the feminine gender marker -ro
(described under 4.4.1), there is no other grounds for positing /e/ and /ro/ as distinct
formatives. It is of interest in these examples, however, that the form irari in irarĩ-ero
coincides with the word for ‘wild pig’ (and the nasalization of the last vowel could follow
from the allomorphy rule given in (18) of chapter 3). Such examples have been presented
here for the sake of completeness, as they are restricted to just a few cases and could as
251well be handled by semi-regular rules of analogy (such as, e.g., some version of lexical
redundancy rules) stored in the lexicon of the language. It is, nevertheless, worthy of
note that some noun stems may take the form of conventionalized onomatopoeic forms.
One last way to form noun stems in Apurinã is shortening. I will only mention in
passing this process here because, for one reason, I have not done any systematic
investigation of it, and, moreover, the little of what I have seen of it indicates it may be
limited to a few instances, or even to a few registers. Shortening can be defined as a
morphological process by which an otherwise unanalyzable word (or an unanalyzable
part of a word) is phonologically reduced. The examples in (100) are illustrative of this
shortening process:
100a. anãpana-ru1 > anãpa
dog-3M
dog‘(male) dog’b. kãkutu > kãku
person
person‘person’As far as I can tell, shortening is less common in Apurinã than, for example, in some
registers of English (cf. professor > prof, cigarettes > cigs, graduates > grads,
grandmother > grandma etc.)4.4.9 Notes on Augmentative versus Diminutive Noun Forms
The purpose of this subsection is to show that although the functional opposition
augmentative versus diminutive is NOT grammatically encoded in the language by any
systematic/specialized form, it can nevertheless be expressed in ways, some of which
may soon get grammaticalized. That is, there is no specific affixal form that can be
classified as strictly an augmentative or a diminutive marker. However, since such a
252functional opposition can be encoded by particular set of morphemes, even if not
completely systematically, it is worth describing it. The unproductive and less than
systematic behavior of the suffix forms described below justifies including them among
the processes of noun stem formation.
A noun has at least two ways to be marked as augmentative, namely by the
suffixation of -powa or -tu. Further historical comparative analysis may reveal that these
two forms evolved out of classificatory nouns (described under 4.1.1.2).
Synchronically, -powa and -tu simply derive a noun of larger than average proportions
for the referents of the nouns they occur with, as seen in (101):
101a. kema-powa
tapir-big‘big tapir’b. mipa-tu
Mipa-big‘big Mipa’As to the diminutive function, there are at least four forms to mark it. They
are -peku, -tuku, -ku, and -ta.25 Note that -ku and -ta are both instances of classificatory
nouns, the first referring to ‘seed; things of a round and small shape’, and the second
referring to ‘things of a roundish edge’ (both described under 4.1.1.2.2). -peku was the
only one mentioned in Pickering 1971:30, there presented as -puku for the dialect he was
describing (i.e. from the Tawamirim village, village 14 in the map in Figure 2 of chapter
1). It is possible that -tuku is formed by -tu (also used to mark augmentative) plus the
classificatory noun -ku ‘seed; thing of a small round shape’, both synchronically
lexicalized into one affixal form. (Aikhenvald [p.c.], however, notes that Tariana has a25The extent to which the use of some of these forms is specific to certain dialects remains to be verified. –ta, for253similar diminutive suffix, namely tuki.) As shown in (102-105), these affixes derive noun
forms whose referents are smaller than the average size:
102a. kuku-peku
man-DIM‘little man’b. tata-peku
umari-DIM‘little “umari” fruit’103a. pataru-tuku
chicken-DIM‘little chichen’b. kema-tuku

white.one-DIM‘little white one; white kernel’105a. putetu-ta
clay.plate-DIM‘(small) plate’b. kopiti-ta

"1.1.1 Auto-Denomination
“Apurinã” is the name used in Brazil to refer to the Popkarwakor people and the
language they speak. The singular forms Popkar and Popikaro refer respectively to the
male and female members of the Popkarwakor society. Ehrenreich (1891:109)
mentions the possibility that the name “Ipuriná” was a denomination given by the
Katawixi people, a putatively distinct and unrelated indigenous group of the same region.
If that really is the case, it constitutes just one more example of an indigenous group
being named on the basis of how it was called (generally depreciatively) in the past by a
neighboring group. Popkar or Popkaro is also sometimes used in many of the Apurinã
communities to refer to non-“White” people, and, in others, to refer exclusively to the
members of the Apurinã society. In only one or two communities I have heard people
referring to themselves as “Ipurinã”, and those were all elders. Ehrenreich mistakenly
says that “Kangiti” is their true name. This term, pronounced /kãkiti/, simply means
‘person’. Other names found in the literature, newspapers etc. to refer to the same group
of people include “Ipurina”, “Ipurinás”, “Ipurinã”, “Ipurinan”, “Ypurinás”, “Ipurynans”,
“Hipurinás”, “Hypurinás”, “Hypurina”, “Tiupurina”, “Tupurinã”, “Jupurina”, “Kankite”,
“Kankutu”, “Kankiti”, “Kankete”, “Cangiti”, “Canguite”, or “Kaxarari”.
The denomination “Apurinã” is currently the one used by the Apurinã speakers
when speaking Portuguese. Thus, the term “Apurinã” can be more properly considered
(in the present time) as a Portuguese word referring to the Popkarwakor/ro people and
3their language, and the terms Popkar(wakoru) and Popkaro(wakoro) are, respectively,
the masculine and feminine (plural) forms that these people use to refer to themselves
when talking in Apurinã. I will use the term “Apurinã” in this work to refer to both
language and people as a matter of convenience, though one should bear in mind that this
is not their name in their language.","[34, 35]"

transitivity of the verb (as shown in chapter 5, under 5.1.1), semantic or pragmatic roles
of the subject NP. What would appear to constitute an exception are the objective
descriptive intransitive verbs, described in the chapter 5, in 5.1.1.1.2.2. If it could be
shown that these verbs have different semantic properties from standard intransitive
verbs, one could argue that pronominal subject markers are co-referential with arguments
other than the single argument of verbs with the semantics of object descriptive verbs and
other than the “patient”-like argument of transitive verbs. However, as was shown in the
previous chapter (in subsection 5.1.1.1.2.2), although the class of descriptive verbs shows
some semantic correlates, it cannot be reduced to a specifiable semantic class of verbs
and, as such, can be more generally characterized as a grammatically (as opposed to
semantically) motivated subclass of intransitive verbs, although one that strongly
correlates with property-referring concepts. That is, the fact that object descriptive verbs
475take object rather than subject as their single argument cannot be motivated on purely
semantic grounds, thus constituting no exception to the claim that the pronominal subject
markers are co-referential with grammatical rather than semantic relations, namely with
the grammatical subject. As a consequence, subject pronominal markers are a reliable
criterion that can be used for the identification of grammatical subjects in Apurinã,
although not all grammatical subjects in other languages will translate as grammatical
subjects in Apurinã.
8.3.1.2Object
The pronominal marking system can be used to distinguish the object from thesubject. As seen in various examples of previous chapters (e.g. 7.1.1, 7.1.12, and in
Tables 6-7 in section 7.3), the pronominal marking system includes a set of (bound)
object markers that is distinct from the set of (bound) subject pronominal markers. This
object pronominal marking is further illustrated in (50), where, e.g. in (50a), the
pronominal form that is suffixed to the verb, i.e. –i, is co-referential with the post-verbal
independent pronoun for second person singular, pite, expressing the undergoer argument
of the verb. The other examples below illustrate the same for the other grammatical
persons of the object paradigm (where underlining marks coreference):

3SG.M beat-2O 2PL
‘They beat you (PL).’
As was shown in (47), the subject can also be an undergoer argument of a verb,
which by itself already suggests that a core grammatical relation encoding an undergoer
argument is not an exclusive property of the object, and, by extension, that grammatical
relations cannot be equated with semantic roles. This is confirmed by the examples in
(50) where verbs expressing from the least to the most “patient”-like meanings all take
the object marking paradigm coreferential with the independent pronominal forms.
Furthermore, to the extent that the single argument of (intransitive) descriptive verbs can
be accompanied by a coreferential object (rather than subject) markers (as was shown, for
example, in chapter 5, in 5.1.1.1.2.2) justifies treating the syntactic expression of such
arguments as bearing object (rather than subject) grammatical relation. So, the single
arguments of each of the simplex sentences illustrated in (51) (repeated from 12 in
4775.1.1.1.2.2) are all coreferential with object pronominal markers in the verb and, as such
bear object relation in these sentences:
51a. pooma-no
nota
be.hot-1SG.O 1SG.
‘I’m/feel hot.’
b. katsopu-ru
ũ-ũwu
be.white-3M.O 3SG.M-flower
‘The flower is white.’
c. pomama-ru
mãka-txi
be.black-3M.O clothes-UNPOSS
‘The clothes are black.’
d. mita-ru
aiko
be.big-3M.O house
‘The house is big.’
Also, as was briefly mentioned in chapter 7 (7.1.1.2.2), the (bound) object
pronominal markers can sometimes be coreferential with the undergoer and sometimes
with the goal argument of verbs that can optionally take a third argument (where “goal”
also functions as a macrorole semantically in that it includes “recipient” and “goal”
semantic roles, and which is properly described in 9.1.2.4). This is precisely what is
demonstrated in (52) (as highlighted by underlining). In (52a), the third person feminine
object pronominal marker -ru is coreferential with the goal NPobl, uwa-mokaru ‘to him’,
whereas in (52b), the third person feminine object pronominal marker is coreferential
with the undergoer NP, nu-serepi ‘my arrow’:
s-V-o.goal UNDERGOER GOAL
52a. o-suka-ru
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
3F-give-3M.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of
‘She gave my arrow to him.’478S
V-o.underg GOAL
UNDERGOER
b. nota suka-ro
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
1SG give-3F.O
3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘I gave the arrow to him.’
The fact that either a NPobl or a NP can be coded in the verb through the
coreferential object pronominal marker (i.e., -ro (52)) indicates that the object of a
(potentially) ditransitive verb can be expressed either as a NP or as a NPobl. Moreover,
the only non-subject argument whose (morpho)syntactic expression is obligatory in a
clause with a ditransitive verb is the goal argument. So, in a clause such as (53a) the only
obligatory non-subject argument is suto ‘woman’, rather than kinharu ‘“buriti” fruit’:10
UNDERGOER s-V-o.goal GOAL
53a. kinharu
u-suka-ro
suto
buriti
3F-give-3F.O woman(F)
‘He gave the woman “buriti” fruit.’
s-V-o.goal GOAL
b. u-suka-ro
suto
3F-give-3F.O woman(F)
‘He gave (it) to the woman.’
Since the object has been defined over the object pronominal markers, it follows
that NPobl that are coreferential with an object pronominal marker bear an object
relationship with the verb. However, object has also been classified above as a core
grammatical relation, that is, one that is required by the lexical meaning of the verb and,
as a result, obligatorily expressed (morpho)syntactically in a clause having such a verb.
Hence, since the only non-subject argument required in a clause with a ditransitive verb
is the goal argument, it would be logical to conclude that only the (morpho)syntactic10I have found more recently that this is not true of all dialects, since in some of them the example in (53b) is479expression of the goal argument should be considered the object of clauses with
ditransitive verbs. So, in an example such as (52b), where it is the undergoer NP
nu-serepi ‘my arrow.of’ that is coreferential with the pronominal marker in the verb (not
the goal NPobl uwa-mokaru ‘to him’), the question arises as to which element is the object
of the verb, the goal NPobl or the undergoer NP. I will maintain that the element that is
coreferential with the pronominal marker in the verb is the object in the cause, thus
postulating that object pronominal marking is the primary definitional property of
grammatical objects. That is, in (52b), uwa-mokaru is the object in the clause. This
question, however, about which element is the object of the verb only appears to arise in
elicited data, as there is no instance of natural spontaneous data where the undergoer
argument is expressed as a free syntactic expression that is coreferential with a
pronominal object marker in the verb. In natural texts, only the goal arguments co-occur
with such a pronominal marker. Instances of both goal and undergoer arguments cooccurring pre-verbally (thus, with no accompanying coreferential marker) is even less
natural and, perhaps, an artifact of the method by which the data are collected, i.e.
through elicitation.
On the face of the fact the syntactic expression of the goal argument can behave
(for the purpose of coreference with the object marker in the verb) similarly to the
syntactic expression of the undergoer argument in some clauses, but differently in others,
one may be led to describe the former situations (i.e. goal behaving the same way as
undergoer) as constituting instances of promotions of non-objects into objects. Although
such an analysis has been suggested for other languages in the past (e.g., Givón’sambiguous, being interpretable as ‘He gave the woman (to somebody)’ or ‘He gave something to the woman.’4801994:233-234 analysis of a piece of data from Machiguenga, another Maipuran
language), it would appear to be equally plausible to describe the marking syncretism
attested for goal and undergoer marking in Apurinã as simply following from what
defines object in Apurinã. In this case, the different ways in which objects are marked in
languages like Apurinã would follow from the same principles that motivate the different
mappings between semantic roles and the grammatical subject in various languages (see
Dryer 1986). In sum, the object in a potentially ditransitive clause in this language will
be the free expression of the non-subject argument that is coreferential with the object
marker in the verb; the third non-subject argument in the clause will be described as an
oblique, regardless of whether it is an undergoer or recipient.
8.3.1.3Remarks on Subject/Object and the Co-referential Pronominal MarkingPatterns
The coreferential marking patterns associated with the subject and object
pronominal markers and the arguments of the verb can be described as involving a type
of Split-S Intransitivity, where the single argument of descriptive (intransitive) verbs is
marked in the same way as the object of transitive verbs, and differently from the single
argument of (standard) intransitive verbs. Following the notation used by Dryer (To
Appear), the grouping of arguments into what is the grammatical subject in Apurinã can
be represented as follows: (Where ‘S’ = the single argument of an intransitive verb, ‘A’ =
more “agent”-like argument of a transitive verb, and ‘P’ = more “patient”-like argument)48154.","[505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513]"
"3666.7 Particles
In addition to the pronominal and demonstrative forms presented above, there are other
closed classes of words with various functions. These other forms are described in this section
under the umbrella particles. In a sense, particles are word classes that do not fit in any of the
other word categories already established. In this sense the category “particles” does function as
a sort of “wastebasket”. But, also, particles do pattern similarly insofar as they generally neither
have any inherent morphology nor take any inherent nominal or inherent verbal morphology.
Furthermore, the general meanings/functions associated with particles are adverbial
modification, and phrasal, clausal or discourse linking, as described and illustrated in the
following subsections. In the order of presentation of each set of particles below I will present
them in terms of their most typical semantic meanings.","[397, 398]"
"420As was briefly mentioned in the previous subsection, of all the 14 position classes
occupied by the special bound formatives described earlier (7.1.1-7.1.14), only those
occupied by the oblique markers and the restrictive marker cannot be part of a verb base.
Conversely, only the gerund marker, the “passive” marker, and the object markers cannot
be part of a typical noun base. Although a more complete survey is necessary in order to
determine exactly which closed word classes can take any of the special bound
formatives, the preliminary evidence presented above suggests that all special bound
formatives that attach to a noun base also attach to one or more of the closed word
classes. For the purpose of describing the general distributional properties of special
bound formatives, these formatives can be presented in terms of whether they occur with
verb bases, with noun bases, with closed class word bases, or with a combination of these
bases. Table 4, where “other bases” refer to any one or more word bases that belong to
closed word classes, summarizes the information about the word category of the possible
host bases of each one of the special bound formatives:421Table 4: Special Bound Formatives and the Category of Their Host Base

+A general property shared by almost all special bound formatives, which is made
explicit in Table 4, is the fact that, except for the gerund, “passive”, and object markers,
every other special bound formative attaches to two or more distinct word categories.
Conversely, except for the gerund marker, “passive”, and object markers, no other special
bound formative occurs exclusively with one word category. Hence, out of 14 slots for
special bound formatives, 7 are found in with at least three distinct word categories, 4 are
found with two word categories, and 3 are found with one word category (namely, the
verb). The property that special bound formatives have of occurring with one or more
host bases of distinct word categories can be used to classify special bound formatives
into three types, as represented in Table 5. In this table, special bound formatives that
attach to host bases of three or more word categories are termed floating special bound
formatives; those that attach to host bases of at least two word categories are termed
quasi-floating special bound formatives; and, those that attach to host bases of one422specific word category are termed non-floating special bound formatives:

OBJECTTherefore, the general tendency is for special bound formatives to be floating or
quasi-floating rather than non-floating. On these grounds, some qualifications need to be
made about the non-floating minority subset of special bound formatives. Such
qualifications apply to the presence/absence of oblique markers in verb bases, to the
presence/absence of object markers in noun bases, and to the status of the “passive”
marker in the language. First, at least some oblique markers are found in deverbal-like
bases. Deverbal-like bases are the word forms that show both noun and verb properties,
and that consist of a verb plus the gerund marker or plus a relativizer. The examples
below constitute instances of an oblique marker attached to deverbal-like bases: The goal
marker -mokaru attaches to V-inhi in (51a) and to V-kuto in (51b):
51a. aiko
nota s-inhi-mokaru
house 1SG go-GER-GOAL
‘My going to the house...’
423b. i-txa
kema owa
hãtako-ro Ø-anhi-kuto-mokaru
3M-say tapir 3SG.F youth-F
3M-take-REL.F.O-GOAL
‘The tapir said to her, the woman whom it took away.’
A detailed discussion of the nominal and verbal properties of V-inhi and V-kuto will be
presented within the appropriate syntactic context in chapter 9, in 9.1.2.2.3 and 9.1.1.6,
respectively.
The second qualification to be made is about the presence/absence of object
markers in noun bases. There is a limited set of noun forms that take the object marker
when these noun forms function as the predicator in a clause. The examples in (52)
present instances of noun bases that function as predicators of non-verbal clauses, and
that take the first person object marker –no, in (52a-b), or the second person object
marker -i, in (52c-d), to encode the sole argument of the predicator:
52a. kiyomane-txi-nhi-pẽ-ka-no
elder-UNPOSS-AFFECT-PFTV-PASS-1SG.O
‘I’ve become old.’
b. kona hãtako-ru-ka-no

‘I’m not young.’
c. popũka-ru-ka4-ra-i
Apurinã-M-PRED-FOC-2SG.O
‘Are you’re Apurinã.’
d. kãkutu-ka4-ra-i
person-M-PRED-FOC-2SG.O
‘Are you’re a (white) person.’
The third qualification, about the functional status of the “passive” marker, is that,
as was made explicit in 7.1.8, the grammatical function/meaning of the “passive” marker
may be undergoing changes in the language, going from a passive marker to a marker of
424a specific subtype of perfectivity. These changes, however, require a better
understanding. At the present time, the current data available do not allow a conclusive
analysis of the function of the “passive” marker or of the distribution of this formative in
terms of the range of the host bases it attaches to. That is, it still is possible that the fact
that the “passive” marker has been attested only with verb bases may be an artifact of the
data available.
Examples such as those in (51-52) would then seem to suggest that some of the
cases (of non-floating formatives) that are listed in Table 5 as possible exceptions to the
predominant (quasi-)floating property of special bound formatives would actually be no
exceptions. However, in the present work, I will maintain the exceptional status of the
oblique markers as well as of the object markers for two specific reasons. The first
reason is that the deverbal-like bases share both noun and verb properties (as will be later
shown in detail in chapter 9, in 9.1.1.6 and 9.1.2.2.3). The second reason is that
examples such as (52), where an object marker attaches to a predicator noun base, so far
have been attested in the speech of a single speaker. It is possible that examples such as
those in (52) are specific to a speech variety that still requires further investigation, in
which case it remains to be shown how representative such examples are of the
morphosyntactic properties of non-verbal clauses in the language. (Non-verbal clauses
are described in chapter 8, in 8.4.2.) Nonetheless, if the status of the gerund, “passive”,
and object marker turns out to be confirmed as non-floating formatives, they would still
differ from the typical affixes found in the language, even if only insofar as they occur
outside of typical affixes in the same way as do (quasi-)floating special bound formatives.
Here may be a good place to note that it is NOT the case that the distribution of
special bound formatives can be predicted in any obvious way on the basis of the surface
425syntactic structure of the language as it applies to free (i.e., non-phonologically bound)
word forms. In other words, although special bound formatives may occur most often in
a particular position in the clause, they do not occupy fixed positions, for example, at the
edge of phrases or clauses. Take, as a first example, the perfective marker -pe. -pe is a
floating special bound formative that occurs most often attached to verb forms. In (53a)
-pe is shown attached to a clause-final verb; in (53b) it occurs attached to a main verb
which precedes the clause-final auxiliary verb; and, in (53c) it attaches to a verb form that
occurs clause initially:
53a. oposo uwa
kema anhika
txa-pe-ro
PTC 3SG.M tapir take.away AUX-PFTV-3F.O
‘So, the tapir, it took her away.’
b. oposo uwa-kata

‘Then she went with it.’
c. ĩ-imata-pe-ro
owa
3M-mate-PFTV-3F.O 3SG.F
‘It had intercourse with her.’
As an instance of a non-floating special bound formative, take the gerund marker
-inhi. -inhi is non-floating because it attaches only to verb bases, as was shown in 0. As
the examples in (54) illustrate, -inhi can occur in host verb bases that are in clause-final,
clause-medial or clause-initial position:
54a. i-ye
komeru i-ye
katarokuru a-kam-inhi

‘…our making of this manioc and of this manioc flour.’

‘In remembering of my cousin, I came here.’
426c. a-yana-poko-t-inhi
uwã
1PL-walk-DISTR-VBLZ-GER there
‘Our visiting around there...’
However, although examples such as (54c) can be attested in spontaneous discourse, it is
the case that the verb base taking -inhi rarely occurs clause initially. That is, the norm is
for -inhi to occur with host bases in clause-medial or clause-final position. This
“dispreference” for the clause initial position is most likely to follow from two properties
of the gerund marker: First,-inhi generally functions as a marker of subordinated clause
(as will be shown in chapter 9, under 9.1), and it happens that Apurinã subordinate
clauses tend to follow rather than precede the matrix clause. Second, -inhi attaches to
verb bases and, as it happens, verbs normally occur in clause—medial or in clause-final
position —when one or more free argument expression(s) is/are found in the clause (as
will be shown in chapter 8, in 8.9.5). Hence, the “dispreference” for clause-initial
position for the host base -inhi to attach to is a by-product of the functional properties of
-inhi as well as of the distributional properties of its host verb base, NOT the result of any
syntactic rule applying to -inhi itself.
As an instance of a quasi-floating special bound formative, take the restrictive
marker -nanu. As (55) illustrates, -nanu occurs with (pro)nominal host bases that are in
clause-initial or in clause-medial position:
watxa ata nhi-pe
55a. a-serota-re-nanu-ra
1PL-salt-POSSED-RESTR-FOC today 1PL eat-PFTV
‘Nowadays (it’s) only with salt that we eat.’
b. uwa-nanu

apa-monhika-ãpo-ta
fetch-GOAL-RANDOM-VBLZ
‘…it was only the language of the elders that we’d go about learning.’
In contrast to the gerund marker, the restrictive marker simply does not occur (in text
material) in host bases that are in clause-final position. This restriction, however, again is
more likely to follow from the meaning properties of the restrictive marker, rather than
from a purely syntactic constraint on its distribution. -nanu individualizes the referential
properties of the (pro)nominal base it attaches too roughly in the same way that the word
only, just and alone do in English. In doing so, -nanu restricts the application of the
meaning conveyed by the predicator of the clause and highlights the importance of the
referent expressed by the (pro)nominal base which -nanu attaches to. Thus, the
“dispreference” for clause-final position is likely to follow from the discourse-pragmatic
properties associated with -nanu. Analogous discourse-pragmatic properties can be more
easily shown to play a role in the placement of the focus of attention marker, -ra
(described in 7.1.11). -ra is a floating special bound formative whose function is to bring
the focus of attention onto the word base to which it attaches. Thus, the
function/meaning of -ra is clearly a discourse one. As it happens, the host bases to which
-ra attaches show strong preference for clause-initial position, although it can sometimes
occur clause-medially. The examples in (56) illustrate the distribution of -ra:

‘Then it would be with him that we’d go.’
-ra occurs in the first word in the clause in (56a, c). Notice that, as it is clear in (56b, d),
the actual preference is not for -ra to occur in the first word; instead, the strong
preference is for the phrasal constituent (rather than simply the word form) with which
-ra occurs to be positioned clause-initially. Moreover, as illustrated in (56e-f), when the
phrasal constituents in which -ra is found do occur clause-medially, these phrasal
constituents are generally preceded by a clause-initial discourse particle —which do not
constitute constituents of the clause. (A detailed discussion of constituent structure will
be presented in chapter 8, in 8.1-2) Here, again the strong preference for a specific
position inside the clause is not necessarily determined by any syntactic constraint but,
instead, it follows from the meaning and functional properties of the special formative in
question. In the case of -ra, it makes perfect sense (from a discourse and cognitive
perspective) to place in the beginning of the clause the construction whose focus of
attention is called for.
429One last important aspect of the distribution of special bound formatives in the
clause is that at least some of them can occur more than once in different host bases in the
same clausal construction —in a way reminiscent of agreement markers in other
languages. It is this repetition of the same special bound formative in the same clausal
construction that is illustrated by the examples in (57): (Repeated forms are underlined in
these examples.)

(57a) illustrates the occurrence of the affectedness marker both in a subject
expression and in a relativized verb form. (57b) illustrates the occurrence of the
frustrative marker both in an associative expression and in a verb form. (57c) illustrates
the occurrence of both frustrative and the future markers in an associative expression and
in a verb form. Finally, (57d-e) illustrate, respectively, the occurrence of the perfective
and the predicate markers both in the main verb and in the auxiliary forms. No case has
been attested where the same special bound form occurs both in a verb form and in its
430expression of its object. Also, no case has been attested of the same special bound
formative being used both in the possessor and in the possessed forms in the same
possession construction. Exactly what the factors determining if/when a special bound
formative can or cannot be repeated in a clausal construction still needs to be determined.
Nevertheless, there is no indication that there is any grammatical factor(s) that is/are
systematically associated with the agreement-like property of some special bound
formatives. In fact, the repetition of the same special bound formative within a syntactic
construction is structurally optional, and, most likely, is motivated by discoursepragmatic factors still to be determined. Nevertheless, regardless of what the motivating
