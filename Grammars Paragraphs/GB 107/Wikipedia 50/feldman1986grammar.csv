"Yes-no questions also have the same focusing strategies avai lable to them a s do
declarative sentences as described in section 9 . 4 .
I n answering an affirmative quest ion , owo means yes

-In answering affirmative yes-no questions , awtuw no denies the accuracy of the

"The answer to a WH-question will ordinarily consist of the word that wi l l most
suitably replace the interrogative in the question . When the interrogative
bears case marking , the answer too wi l l usually have it , even if the answer
consists of only a single word . It is common , though not quite as common as
in answers to alternative questions , for the particle po to focus the answer .

"4 . 7 . 2 Next we mus t isolate Potential forms marked by the prefix n a - from
non-Potential forms . Note that Debitive and Potential are mutually exclus ive
categories because both are marked by s lot -8 prefixe s .
4. 7.3The next step is to d istingui sh forms specified as Negative from those
specified as non-Negative , for both Debitive and non-Debitive categories . Thi s
feature dist inguishes Negative Debitive forms with the prefixes a p - and ni 1 from non-Negative Debitive forms with the pre fixes pa - , k a n - , and wan - . I t
also distinguishes among non-Debitive , non-Potential forms . Again , the
position of the pre fixes that mark the categories make Potential and Negative
mutua l ly exclus ive .
Thi s leaves a three-way distinction among Potential forms with the pre f ix n a - ,
Negative non-Potential forms with the pref ix ka - , and non-Negative non-Potential
forms with no pre f ix in s lot - 8 . The morpho logical and semantic unmarkedness
of the non-Negative non-Potential j u stif ies naming the feature Negative rather
than Affirmative .

"Unlike the second- and third-person debitive modalities , the Hortative has no
negative portmanteau counterpart so there is no exact Awtuw equivalent for an
Engl ish le t 's not . . . construction .
In such c ircumstances , an Awtuw speaker
would either use a lexical antonym , e . g . let 's go ! for let 's not stay ! , or a
Negative Desiderative , e . g . nom kae-w- i k i y - re re we don ' t want to stay .
( 2 ) Imperative s are marked by the prefix k a n - and its many al lomorphs , whose
distribution is described in section 2 . 2 . As with Hortative s , the person of an
Imperative verb is always recoverable , and the second person pronoun may or may
not occur .

The labels I have ass i gned to the three suff ixes that occur in s lot +5 are
entirely tran sparent . Verbs marked with the Past tense suffix depict s i tuations
which occurred prior to the speech event . Verbs with Future marking depict
s ituations that are expected to occur after the speech event , and verbs with
Desiderative marking depict s i tuations that the speaker de s i re s to come about .
Awtuw tense marking does not d i s t inguish grades of temporal proximity - s imply

"56
( 3 ) Prohibitives with the pre f ix a p-/�p- are the negative counterpart of
imperative s and , l ike imperatives , always have second-person subj ects . Clauses
with Prohibitive verbs share most of the prope rties of other debitive clauses ,
but are even more likely to be verb f inal .

Forms on this branch distingui sh Nonfactivity as marked in slot - 7 . A lthough
the Nonfactive prefix w- and the Factive prefix d- both make more than one
tense di stinction , it is preferable to identify Nonfactive as the marked form
for the purpose of this analy s i s .
S ince non-Debitive , non-Potential forms make precisely the same distinctions
regardless of their spec i f i cation for Negativity , further d i scussion w i l l be
neutral with respect to Negativity .
Nonfactive and non-Nonfactive forms distinguish tense through the feature
Nonpresent . Nonfactive forms spec i fied Nonpresent bear the Future suffix
and those specif ied non-Nonpresent bear the Desiderative suff ix . Non-Nonfactive
forms specif ied Nonpresent have past tense mark i ng , whi le those speci fied
non-Nonpresent are unmarked for tense .
This feature Conditional dist ingui shes forms with the Conditional suffix in
slot +4 from those that lack it. Condi tional forms are redundantly speci f ied
as Nonfactive . Thus non-Nonfactive forms wil l automatically be specif ied as
non-Conditional , while Nonfactive forms distingui sh Conditional and non­
Conditiona l .
Thi s analys i s conveniently specifies Conditional forms , which occur i n past
contrafactual condition s , as Nonfactive , Nonpresent , and Conditional , and
Frustratives , which depict frustrated de s i re s , as Nonfactive , non-Nonpresen t ,
and Conditional . Note that the only marker from s lot +5 that may co-occur with
the Conditional suf f ix i s the Desiderative suff ix .
I t is now appropriate to d i splay another diagram to c larify the feature
specif ications made thus far and the i r correspondence with verb suffixes .

Potential forms require Nonfactive marking and may bear either the Future
or the Conditional suffix. Redundancy rule 1 yields all possible forms under
this node.

+Nonpresent
Note that Potential forms must also be non-Debitive and non-Negative , but
because all three categories, potential, Debitive, and Negative are expressed
by affixes in the same slot, the redundancy rule need not specify it.
Potential forms may still be specified for Conditionality. Potential
Conditionals take the Conditional suffix and Potential non-Conditionals take
the Future suffix, as was the case with non-Potential forms specified as
Nonfactive and Nonpresent.
-+4.7.6Two additional redundancy rules will specify the mood and tense values
for Debitive forms. The first of these stipulates that Negative Debitives will
also be Nonfactive and Nonpresent, and so have Future marking, and
non-Negative Debitives will be neither.
( 49 ) Redundancy rule 2

The second stipulates that any form specified as either Debitive or

-+4. 7. 7A further redundancy rule specifies the permissible aspect distinctions
for each tense/mood category isolated above.
( 5 1 ) Redundancy rule 4

[etPerfect]
This rule stipulates that any form specified as Perfect will also be
non-Imperfective regardless of the specifications for the other three features
and that non-Perfect forms that
also non-Debitive, non-Nonfactive, and
non-Nonpresent must be specified are
as
Imperfective. In other words , forms with
any Debitive or tense marking may bear
either Perfect or Imperfective marking,
or be unmarked for aspect, while non-Debitive
forms unmarked for tense must
bear either the Perfect or the Imperfective suffix.","[68, 69, 70]"

among the affixes that may appear in the Awtuw verb complex . A simple statement
of positional restrict ions can account for some o f these . A verb may not be
spec ified , for example , as both Negative and Potential because once the
Negative prefix has occupied s lot -8 , the Potential prefix cannot do so , and
vice versa .
A number of co-occurrence restrictions apply to affixes that f i l l different
s lot s . The purpose of this section is to submit the relevant morphemes to an
analysis that assign s a set of feature speci fications to each and stipulates
the i r co-occurrence poss ibi lities in terms of a set of redundancy rules .
We w i l l be primarily concerned with the categories of tense , aspect , and mood ,
represented in verbal affixes in s lots - 8 , -7 , -2 , +2 , +4 , and +5 . There w i l l
also b e reason t o touch o n the category o f person , which i s represented i n
Awtuw onl y as a portmanteau o f the Debitive modal ity prefixes , and number .
S ince no co-occurrence restrictions apply to the other categories marked by verb
morphology , it w i l l be unnecessary to analyse them in thi s way .
Three features dist ingu i sh the categor ies of modal ity marked in s lot - 8 . The
feature Debitive distinguishes forms marked with p a - , kan - , wa n - , a p - , and n i 1 from those marked with n a - , k a - , or ¢ . Potential distinguishe s those marked
with n a - from tho se marked with k a - or ¢ . Negative distinguishes those marked
with ka- from unmarked forms on the one hand , and those marked with pa - , kan - ,
and wa n - from those marked with a p - and n i l - on the other .
The feature Nonfactive distinguishes forms marked with w- in s lot -7 from
those that do not bear the Nonfactive pre fix . As I mentioned in the discussion
above , Factive and Nonfactive marking is conditioned by tense . This makes the
non-Factive feature useful in the spec i f ication of the tense suffixes as wel l
as the Factive and Nonfactive prefixes . Specifical ly , the feature
distinguishes Future and Desiderative forms from Past and unmarked forms .
The purpose of this analysis is to describe co-occurrence restrictions on overt
morphemes . The features therefore corre spond directly with morphological
categor ies . Ideal ly , a feature mediates between a morphologically marked
category and a corresponding semantic category . S ince the morphological
category of Nonfactivi ty i n Awtuw i s semantically redundant , specifications
of forms for thi s feature may at times seem arbitrary .
The feature Nonpresent distinguishes Past and Future forms , which are overtly
marked and have Nonpresent time reference from Desiderative forms and forms
unmarked for tense , which have present time reference .
Fina l l y , the features Conditional , Perfect , Imperfective , Second Person , Third
Person , P lural , and Dual are morphologically and semantically transparent .
Since the categories o f aspect , person , and number i n Awtuw a l l make three-way
d i st inction s , a pair of features is required for each .","[65, 66, 67]"

The debi ti ve modal i t i e sAwtuw codes debitive i l locutionary force , i . e . commands , necessiti es , and
strong sugge stions , in a set of pre f ixes that occupy the very first slot in
the verb complex a long with the negative and potential prefixes . It is only
in the debitive modalities that verb affixes are sensi tive to the person of
the subj ect .
( 1 ) The Hortative prefix p ( a ) - occur s only with fi rst person subj ects and is
used in situations where the subj ect wi shes to express a f irm intention to do
something in the immed iate future with an implicit request for the addres see ' s
permiss ion or agreemen t . Semantically , the Awtuw Hortative bears a very c lose
resemblance to Engl ish le t-Hortative s .",[60]

language in its social and sociolinguistic context, Chapter 2 provides an
overview of Awtuw's rich phonological and morphophonological system, Chapter
examines the structure of a few lexical fields of general interest, and Chapter
12 describes some paralinguistic phenomena.
111 . 1 . 3 The aims and methodology of linguistic theory and of linguistic
description are fundamentally different. The aim of theory is to delimit and
explain the functions of language in human society and human cognition. Its
methodology must therefore be to establish a set of explanatory principles that
will generate hypotheses about linguistic functions and the ways that languages
can express them. These hypotheses can then be tested against empirical data
about languages.
The aim of linguistic description is to identify the formal classes, categories ,
and structures of a language on empirical , language-internal evidence. Its
methodology must therefore be to examine and analyse such evidence and to
correlate the formal properties so isolated with their semantic functions.
In other words, it must describe language from the addressee's perspective
decoding forms into meanings, rather than from the speaker's perspective
encoding meanings into forms.
This is not to insist that every identifiable form is necessarily in a one-to­
one correspondence with a single meaning; we often encounter examples of
polysemy or structural ambiguity. But, as a heuristic, we do not expect a
mUltiplicity of forms to correspond to a single semantic category.
1 . 1 . 4 The approach taken in this description is therefore essentially
structuralist. I assume the utility of binary features and relative markedness
in distinguishing categories at all levels of structure. I further assume that
features used in a description should correspond to empirically identifiable
categories. Whenever possible, I have attempted to establish a correspondence
between formal categories and plausible semantic categories .
A feature-based analysis has two advantages . Features often cross-classify
such that a small set of formal/functional properties can distinguish a large
number of categories . It is also possible to make certain kinds of generalis­
ations regarding the properties of marked and unmarked categories.
For example, in the analysis of tense marking in Chapter 4, the feature
NONPRESENT at the same time distinguishes Present forms from Past forms, Future
from Desiderative, and Conditional from Frustrative. It also identifies the
morphologically unmarked Present with the semantically unmarked category of
non-NONPRESENT.
Throughout this description, I have aimed to express significant generalisations
intelligibly. When it seemed to further this aim, have borrowed formalisms
from Generative theory. I do not mean this to imply any credence in the claims
of the theory. The formalisms merely represent a handy and familiar convention
for schematising certain types of generalisations.
When a language is described in accordance with these principles, the hypotheses
generated by theory can be tested against the description. I have attempted
therefore to present an analysis that is empirically-based and relatively
theoretically neutral , and that reflects the structure of the language
faithfully.
I31.2Geography, gene t i c a ffi l i at i on, h i s to ry, a n d ethnogra phy1.2.1Awtuw is the first language of about 400 people living in five villages
between 142°29 ' and 142°3 1 ' East longitude and 3°3 4 ' and 3°3 6 South latitude in
an area of about 30 square kilometres in the southern foothills of the
Torricelli Range in north-western Papua New Guinea (see Map 1 ) . All five
villages are administered as part of the South-west Wapei Census Division of
the Lumi District, Sandaun (West Sepik) Province of Papua New Guinea.
The five Awtuw-speaking villages are located at altitudes ranging from 3 2 0 to
400 metres above sea-level. Rainfall in Kamlakwlape, recorded from May to
December 1980 , ranged from a low of 7 1 . 5mm in June to a high of 2 3 7 . 7mm in
December. Temperatures range from 19 . 4° to 3 2 . 2° Celsius, with an average of
2 2 . 2° at 0600 and 29 . 4° at 1500 daily, with no appreciable seasonal variation.
Table 1.1 lists the five villages with their vernacular names, their names in
Tok Pisin, their populations in 1980 , and the names of the component hamlets.

Wutlakwlape' s three hamlets are closely clustered about 45 minutes' walk south­
east of Meleylape. Lalpinlape is about 25 minutes' walk south of Meleylape and
Kalpelape is another 10 minutes' walk south. The two hamlets of Tupumlape ,
located about two hours' walk south of Kalpelape , are adjacent to each other

"CHAPTER 1I NTRODUCT I O N
1. 1PrefaceThe data upon which I base the description presented here was collected in the
course of a field trip of 15 months' duration' (November 1979 February 1 9 8 1 )
in the village of Kamnum, the largest of the five Awtuw-speaking villages .
Insofar as possible I have gleaned examples from a small corpus of narrative
text. But I have also used elicited examples to illustrate points where
necessary.
The content and structure of this description rest on a number of assumptions
which I will attempt to make explicit.
-1 . 1 . 1 Language is a singularly prominent facet of culture in that it serves as
the main repository and channel of communication of culture. But there are
areas of linguistic structure that may in most cultures be described
conveniently and without significant distortion as discrete from other aspects
of culture.
within the domain that is nuclear to language, there are a number of structural
components that mediate between meanings to be conveyed and the acoustic code
through which they are transmitted. These components are the proper subject of
linguistic description.
1 . 1 . 2 The physical properties of the acoustic code are marginal to linguistic
description. Similarly, the nature of the relations between expressible
meanings and cognitive processes on the one hand and external reality on the
other, are marginal to the description of linguistic structure.
within this periphery are three main structural components. The phonological
component mediates between meaningful forms and the acoustic code through which
they are transmitted. The lexical component mediates between lexical forms and
expressible meanings. And the grammatical component organises the composition
and combination of lexical forms , mediating, as it were , between the other two
components .
Viewed in this way, the grammatical component is central to linguistic structure.
I intend here to present a comprehensive, even if not exhaustive , description
of the morphology, syntax, and morphosyntax of Awtuw. Because Awtuw is a
previously undescribed language, I include information on aspects of the
language peripheral to my main concerns. Specifically, Chapter 1 places the1Feldman, H. A grammar of Awtuw.

the data it is based upon belong to the Awtuw speaking people of Kamlakwlape,
Wutlakwlape , Wiyuplape , Tupumlape, and Kalaktuwlape .
I am most deeply indebted to the people of Meleylape , who allowed me to live in
their hamlet for fifteen months, who helped me in many ways, and who patiently
taught me their language . Among those who were most forthcoming were Yowmen,
Takiy, Poliw, Altiy, Awkay, Awtiy, Eykiy, Kampo, Keriy, Mimpel , Momoy, Naytow,
Osiy, Ruwmay, Wawpey, Yinow, Napeyre, Nimpiy. I am particularly grateful to
Kewmaey, Yawur, Yakop, and Napeyre, who allowed me to tape their narratives and
to Peyaw, Mimpel, and Ruwmay, who dictated stories to me . There is no way that
I can ever repay my debt to Yawur and Yakop, who helped me to transcribe texts
and provided virtually all of the elicited material I have used.
I am also grateful to the Institute of Papua New Guinea Studies, the Department
of Language at the University of Papua New Guinea, the Sandaun Provincial
Government, the Lumi District Office, and Kewmaey, Councillor for the Awtuw­
speaking area, for their permission to study Awtuw.
A large number of people deserve my thanks for the accommodation they so
graciously provided. Wietze Baron accommodated me at Ukarumpa. Paul of the
Lumi Police Detachment, Ian Bagley and other staff at Lumi High School , Father
Terry and others at St Mary' s Catholic Mission, and Kewmaey allowed me to stay
in their houses in Lumi . And Brian McClintock put me up in Port Moresby.
Leo Yimiten and Lumi District Office Staff helped me in a variety of ways and
made the 1980 census data available to me .
Val Lyon of the Department of Geography, Faculty of Arts at the Australian
National University was kind enough to draw the map.
Ger Reesink, Wietze Baron, Ken McElhanon, Les Bruce, and Dave Scorza of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics (PNG Branch) discussed my proposed fieldwork
with me and provided me with access to some unpublished material in their
library.
Don Laycock, Cecil Brown, Bill Mitchell , and Keith Thomas corresponded with me
and encouraged me while I was in the field.
I would also like to thank Avery Andrews , Cliff Goddard, Ian Green, Walter
Seiler, Tim Shopen and David Wilkins for discussing my work with me, and Cliff
and David in particular for their valuable comments on draft chapters .
The Australian National University provided me with a generous scholarship
which made it possible to undertake this project at all .
Finally, my gratitude to Tanya and Adam McConvell for their support and
encouragement is unbounded.

Imperfective form. Simi larly , any Negative prefix must occur on both verbs , as

stem which enters into the verb complex as if it were a single root . While any
verb may be the first in such a compound , the second and subsequent roots are
se lected from a clo sed set of about 30 member s . About a third of the members
of this set may themselves function as independent verb roots in meanings
reasonably closely re lated to the meanings they express in a compound . The
balance bear no phono logical resemblance to any independent verb root , although
they al l have a phonologica l shape that would be plausible for one .
The morphemes that may occur as the second and subsequent components of such a
compound range in meaning from �2� give , which marks verbs with a benefactive
argument , through aspectual meanings l ike ! ��� begin and �2 � � � comp le te ly ,
auxi l iary- like meanings l ike (�� � ) e � try , and adverbial meanings l ike � �� !�
secre t ly , to meanings that more closely resemble a second predicate , l ike � ��� �
. . . and g o away .
There is no apparent correlation between the independence of the morpheme and
the independence of its meaning from that of the matrix verb root . Thus , kow
the bene factive marker , which has the most clearly ' grammatical ' meaning of the49
morphemes in this set , is among the commonest verbs in the language used
independently . But � �Y!:!� . . and go Cf1;)ay , one of the morphemes with the most
conspicuously independent meanings , bear s no resemblance to any independent
verb root .

"5.2Maj o r c l a s se s o f verb roo tsA number of factors conspire to compl icate the classification of Awtuw verb
roots on strictly formal ground s . First , a l l verbs , with a few exceptions
discussed i n section 4 . 14 , have prec isely the same properties with regard to
the affixes they may bear . Second , the four con j ugation c lasses described in
section 4 . 1 3 do not correlate with any other grammatical or semantic categorie s .
And third , many contexts permit , or even require , the deletion o f NPs .
The analysis I present here w i l l rest heavily on the number of NPs that co-occur
with various verb roots and what the i r grammatical relation is to the verb .
The first thing to notice is that no verb root in Awtuw always occurs without
an accompanying NP . NPs may be deleted in e l l iptical contexts to leave a verb
form alone in a clause , but i n unmarked , out-of-the-blue contexts , a l l Awtuw
verbs have at least one accompanying NP .
Before embarking on the analys i s it is important to point out that the
Benefactive marker - kow- may be suff ixed to a wide variety of verb roots .
This suffix increases the valency of the verb so that it may co-occur with a
bene ficiary NP in addi tion to any NPs that they otherwise co-occur with . I n
establ ishing the basic classification of verbs , therefore , I will be considering
only those that do not bear thi s suffix .
Final ly , it is appropriate at thi s stage to define the verb phrase as the
constituent that includes :
- a verb form ,
- any NP e l igible to bear Obj ect marking , ( c f . 5 . 7 and 6 . 1- 2 ) ,
- the goal or source NP with a Direction verb ( c f . 5 . 3 . 1 and 5 . 4 . 1 ) ,
- the source NP with the verb ka ( c f . 5 . 4 . 1 and 6 . 4 ) .",[97]

for plurality with the suffix -m . Non-plural forms further distingui sh female
from non-female referents . The optional t- in the pronouns and the manner

also seem to be in free variation .

e . g . a house , a road, a river, a part of a house o r a tree , etc . It also marks
the location of a state , process , or action , again provided that the NP refers
to a place . The meaning of the as sociated verb determines the interpretation
of Locative NP as e i ther location or direction , and if direction , whether
from or to . Thus , unless the clause contains a Direction verb , the Locative NP
wil l refer to a location . I f the clause contains the verb �y go , one of the
other Goal verbs ( c f . 5 . 2 ) or a seriali sation with �y , then the Locative NP
wil l refer to a goal . And i f the clause contains the verb �y� come , one of the
other Source verbs ( c f . 5 . 2 ) , or a seriali sation ending in �y� , then the
Locative will be a source . There are a number of ' location ' nouns that commonly
compound with other nouns to make the reference of the Locative more explicit
( c f . 3 . 7 . 2 ) . The fol lowing list includes all such nouns that have come to my
attention .","[119, 120]"
"10 . 1Seri a l i s a t i o n sAwtuw has six seriali sation strategies . The first and most tightly -knit
construction concatenates verb roots within a single verb complex . The second
appends a form of a direction verb to a truncated , suffixle s s form of another
verb . The third concatenates repetitions of the same verb form . The fourth
concatenates full verb forms , the fifth concatenates verb phrase s , and the
sixth concatenates an Imperfective verb form with a full clause .",[158]
"81.3Soc i o l i ng u i s t i c sThe Sepik region as a whole , and the Lumi District i n particu lar , are
l inguistically very diverse ( Laycock 1968 , 197 3 ) . Of the roughly 3 0 , 000
inhabitants of the District , over 10 , 000 are speakers of 010, a Torricelli
Phylum language with over 1 5 , 000 speakers , some of them in other administrative
area s . The remaining 2 0 , 000 people speak 2 1 other language s . With 400
speakers , Awtuw i s larger than many of the surrounding languages .
Such diversity , combined with a general rule of local exogamy , engenders a
re latively astounding degree of multilingualism. Typically , an 010 speaker
married to another 010 speaker will speak only 010 and Tok P i s in . But speakers
of any of the smal ler languages will usua lly speak 010 and Tok P i s in , in
add ition to their f irst language . I f an individual ' s parents speak different
language s , he or she is l ikely to speak at least four . Husbands who do not
speak the ir wife ' s language usually learn it , and wives who do not speak their
husband ' s language always do . People with relations or other contacts further
afield commonly speak as many as seven or eight languages .
Children in the Awtuw-speaking area start to learn Awtuw and Tok Pisin at the
same time . By the age of three or four they express themselves more comfortably
in Awtuw , but they become genuinely f luent in Tok Pisin by the age of f ive ,
whi l e it may take another three to five years to master Awtuw entire ly . By
that time the child will have also learned a modicum of 010 and of other
languages that he or she comes into contact with .
Because Awtuw-speaking women marry into villages that do not speak Awtuw , there
are a number of Awtuw speakers outside the five v i l lages . Naturally , such
Awtuw-speaking women continue to speak Awtuw themselves and the ir chi ldren a lso
speak Awtuw . What strikes one as interesting is that their husbands usual ly
learn it as wel l . That adults continue to learn Awtuw as a second language
indicates that the language remains vital and is likely to continue to thrive .
There are Awtuw- speaking populations in the fol lowing villages ( see Map 1 ) :Tab l e 1 . 2 : V i l l a ges wi th Awtuw s peakers

As I mentioned above , Awtuw , a lthough it has so few speakers , has more than one
dialect . In fact , there are three - the Southern diale c t , the Witit dialect ,
and the maj ority dialect that I describe in this grammar . The Southern dialect ,
spoken in the two southernmost v i l lage s , Kalaktuw and Tupum , has two very
distinct phonological features . First , it has completely neutralised the
distinction made in the maj ority dialect between I rl and III in favour of the
I l l . And second , it has replaced the word- initial I Q I of the major ity dialect
with 1 7 / . Thus I r a re re l want to eat in the maj ority dialect is I l a l e l el in the
Southern dialec t , and IQa l e l fish becomes 1 7 a l e/ .
The witit dialect i s spoken by only one l i neage i n the hamlet o f Witi tlape in
Kamlakw. It is distinguished from the maj ority dialect in replacing word­
initial IQI with In / . Thus I Qalel fish becomes In a l e/ , homophonous with I n a l el
ho Ze .
Interestingly , the neutral isation of I rl and III and of IQI and I n l are two
features of child language as well as the main indicators of dialect
dif ferences.","[13, 14, 15]"
"( 1 ) Although sub j ects never bear case marking, there are other nouns that may
occur in the c lause that never bear case marking e i ther ( c f . 6 . 1 and 5 . 4 ) .
( 2 ) Obj ect marking is obl i gatory on some di rect obj ects and optional on others
(cf. 6 . 2 ) .
( 3 ) Although indirect obj ects always bear obj ect marking , certain direct
obj ects do so too ( c f . 6 . 2 ) .
Furthermore , a lthough Awtuw ' s basic word order is readily identifiable as verb
fina l , indeed as 50V, as order and other permutations are far too common to
allow word order to be of any value in ident ifying grammatical relations .
It is possibl e , nevertheless , to i solate the three relations on the basis of a
more complicated s tatement of their case marking properties in combination with
other criteria . It is important to be able to identi fy grammatical relations
on formal grounds. and without re ference to verb semantics because the
classif icat ion of verbs in section 5 . 2 relies on the ir abi lity to co-occur with
NPs in various grammatical relations .",[93]

3. 1Approach to parts -of- s peech a na l ys i sIn accordance with the descriptive strategy adopted throughout this grammar,
this section will endeavour to segregate on language-internal morpho syntactic
grounds discrete classes of lexemes in Awtuw, to identify subclasses of the
classes so segregated, and to relate the classes thus isolated to universal
semantic categories.
The most revealing way to view a part-of-speech system
is as a few large stem classes . . . divided into
successively smaller classes on the basis of additional
criteria. (Hockett 1958 : 2 2 1 - 2 2 8 )
Following Hockett, we can impose a structure on our analysis of the Awtuw
parts-of-speech system by dividing Awtuw lexemes into broad classes and
refining these into more restricted classes corresponding to the parts of
speech in Awtuw.
I refine Hockett ' s method by treating each identifying property as a privative
feature , which can segregate two classes according to the presence or absence
of the feature (Trubetzkoy 1969 : 7 4 ) . The presence of a feature characterises
the marked category.
The structure of a parts-of-speech system thus takes on the shape of a
bifurcating tree each of whose branchings represents the segregation of two
classes based on the specification for a given feature. When no additional
formal properties serve to segregate pairs of categories, the branch terminates
in a named class. In some cases it is possible to name superordinate classes .
Figure 3 . a exemplifies the structure.

CLASS INC5F i g u re 3 . a : exampl e2627
To clarify the feature specification, I have included a matrix with each tree.
Once a class had been isolated at any level of structure, specification for
features associated with other classes becomes irrelevant to its classification.
Therefore, not all features used in this analysis cross-classify. For example,
referring to Figure 3.a, the specification of Named Class 3 for feature B is
irrelevant to its classification, and will therefore be enclosed in parentheses
in the associated matrix, Table 3 . a.

(+)-While it is assumed here that the assignment of words to
parts-of-speech classes is based on properties that are
grammatical rather than semantic, and often language­
particular rather than universal, it is also assumed that
the name that is chosen for a particular parts-of-speech
class in a language may appropriately reflect universal
semantic considerations . (Schachter, 1985 : 2 ,
cf. Lyons 1968:147 , 317-319)
I will therefore refrain from assigning names to the classes isolated in this
analysis until they have been refined sufficiently to suggest a correlation
with a universal semantic type (cf. Dixon 1977 :19-20, 24-30, Lyons ' 1 966: 214) .
The diagnostic properties used to segregate the parts-of-speech classes here
will identify all members of any class , including derived forms. But in
assigning names to classes, it is necessary to identify a focal subclass whose
members are necessarily monomorphemic.
3.2Maj o r c l a s se sFirst we can segregate those lexemes that accept the Perfect aspect suffix - kay
from those that do not and denominate the segregated class Class I .
Next, we can divide those lexemes that cannot bear aspect marking into two
additional classes. We call those that can occur as the unique constituent of
a noun phrase Class II �nd the residuum that cannot, Class III .
It may clarify this tripartite division to represent the identifying criteria
by binary features and display the specifications for each class on a matrix.
(Values for features that are irrelevant to the classification are enclosed in
parentheses) .","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33]"

range from the strategy described in section 3 . 7 . 3 and 4 . 14 , which fuses roots
within a single verb complex , to strateg ie s that con join clauses with separate
sets of NPs and complete ly independent speci fication for verbal categories .
This chapter describe s the forma l properties of each construction and re lates
them to the ir semantic functions .
The constructions fall into five di stinct categorie s . Serial isation construc­
t ions concatenate verb roots , verb forms , or verb phrases whose subj ects are
obl igatorily co-referential to code diverse semantic functions ranging from an
increase in valency to a sequence of actions .
Nominal constructions subordinate a verb phrase or a full c lause as a
constituent of an NP per forming a nominal or ad j ectival function. In these
constructions , the tense of the subordinate verb is e ither determined by the
construction or interpreted as relative to the tense of the matrix verb .
Nominal constructions code a variety of relations ranging from so-called psych­
action complements , such as ' remembe r to . . . ' , to cause clause s , inc luding
re lative c lause s .
Adverbial constructions code actions contemporaneous or sequential to the
action coded by the matrix verb . They are formally similar to nominal
constructions in some respect s . But where a nominal clause is marked a s
subordinate with the suffix - re , a n adverbial clause bears the suf fix - rek .
Moreover , the subject of an adverbial clause may not occur as the obj e c t o f
the matrix clause , a s is possible in certain nominal constructions . And an
adverbial clause functions adverbial ly rather than nominally or adj ectivally .
Condi tional constructions j uxtapose two interdependent clause s which must bear
identical future or conditional marking .
Co-ordination constructions j uxtapose two or more entirely independent clauses
to code simultaneous , consecutive , and unspecified re lations among predicate s .","[155, 156, 157, 158]"
"3 . 8 . 1 The suffix - neney i s enormous ly productive and regularly forms
apparently nonce express ions from any e l igible noun , i . e . any common noun .
Its basic meaning would appear to be to attribute the noun bearing the suffix
as a property or posses sion of the noun that the derived adj ective mod i f ie s .
The examples i n ( 3 8 ) illu strate these two meanings .

Awtuw ' s closed class of adj ectives . Unl ike many other languages with closed
adj ective classes , many of the gaps in the inventory of basic adj ectival50
meanings are filled not by nouns or verbs ( cf . Schachter to appear p . 1S ) , but
rather by derived adj ectives with - n eney .

the two a llomorphs appears to be lexically conditioned . Perhaps most important
among these is the derivation of colour terms . Section 1 1 . 2 contains further
discussion of colour terminology .

-wcew DUAL and -worn PLURAL and on Place names and most common nouns and
adj ectives in the case of ycen i rn GENERIC . All three of these have the pecu l iar
property of deriving a form with some of the morphological character istics of a
personal pronoun from a noun . Both the di stribution of the number markers and
the morphological properties of personal pronouns rece ive fuller discussion in
section 3 . 5 and 3 . 6 . But briefly , where nouns may not take the possessive
suffix - ke , nouns bearing the number markers may . Where a subclass of nouns
may take the locative suffix - a / - ka , nouns with number marking may not . And
where nouns take one of the allomorphs of the object marker beginning with a
consonant , number-marked nouns take the al lomorphs consisting of a vowe l alone .
-CHAPTER 4V E RBAL MORPHOSYNTAX4. 1Structure o f the verb compl exMany o f the aff ixes discussed in this chapter have already appeared in section
2 . 2 . There I was concerned with the changes phonemes undergo in the presence
of other spec i fied phonemes and boundaries in the verb complex and elsewhere .
Here , I descr ibe the formal morphological simi larities and differences among
verbs , the co-occurrence of affixes , and the meanings and functions of the
affixe s . I llustrative paradigms are to be found at the end of this chapter .
We can begin by examining a few highly expanded forms of typical verbs to
i l lustrate the overall structure of the verb complex and the order of the
elements that it compr ises . For the sake of intel ligibility , I wi l l f irst
display a table o f the slots i n the verb complex and the affixes that may f i l l
them , and then present the evidence for the analys i s . with the exception o f
slot +1 , the l i s t s o f affixes for each slot are exhaustive . I discuss the
aff ixes that occur in slot +1 fully in section 4 . 1 2 .
Co-occurrence restrictions make three examples neces sary to i l lus trate the
relative order of a f f ixes in all slots . I will discuss these in subsequent
section s .
Example ( 1 ) shows the relative order o f a f f ixes i n s lots -8 , - 7 , - 6 , - 5 , -4 ,
- 3 , 0 , +1 , +2 , and +5 .

The ye l ow/y i ma y reflexive construction has a very low functional load - there
are no examples whatsoever in the corpus of narrative I have collecte d . This
is in part because in many of the cases where one might expect frequent
reflexivisation , for example with a verb l ike �QrY� wash , the reflexive is
lexical ised , in this ins tance by y i w l Y�� water bathe .

In this case , the intonation rises over the penultimate syllable of each verb
in the serialisation , except the last , and remains high over the lengthened
ultimate syllable , fol lowed by a brie f paus e . When the subj ect changes or is
repeate d , the intonation falls from a high pitch ove r the penultimate syllable
to a low pitch over the las t . Example [ 1 1 ] i llustrates the intonation contour
over e xample ( 1 1 ) and example ( 1 3 ) shows the intonation contours over two
similar sentences .

respects . Although there is no actual participial form in Awtuw , an
Imper fective form unmarked for tense functions like one in this construction .
The situations depicted by the two verbs are interpreted as simultaneous .
The tense of the second verb has scope over the unmarked first verb .
The ability of a subj ect to occur with the second , tense -marke d , verb
distinguishe s this construction from the one described in 10 . 1 . 5 .

Wurm ( 1 9 7 7 a ) has drawn attention to a remarkable consistency among the diverse
languages of New Guinea in the forms of certain personal pronouns . Examining
the s ingular forms in all three persons and the first and second person plural s ,
h e finds that most of the pronouns marking these categories throughout New
Guinea fall into one of three basic sets and that a given language wi l l often
select most of its pronouns from the same set or in a predictable way from two
or a l l three set s . Because the pronominal forms in a given set crop up over a
geographically large area and in no way restrict themselves to s ingle genetic
groupings , Wurm concludes that personal pronouns are , contrary to popular
opinion , commonly borrowed from language to language .
Awtuw ' s personal pronouns are quite consi stent in their set membership . The
second person plural form bears no resemblance to the pronouns in any of the
sets Wurm has establ i shed . But the other four categories a l l display Set I
feature s .
One of the postulated Set I forms for third person singular i s / te / , which
resembles the corresponding female form in Awtuw quite c losely . There i s a l so
a predictable consonant alternation , character istic of Set I pronouns signal l ing
the gender distinction in the third person s ingular . A property of second
person s i ngular forms in Set l aX appears to end in a coronal consonant and
begin with a /y/ , as does the Awtuw form /ye n / . S imilar l y , Set I first person
forms typica lly contain an / n / , while Set X forms add to this a /wV - / in the
s ingular , and an /-m/ in the plura l , yie lding the Awtuw forms /wa n / and / nom/ .
Personal pronouns have a somewhat different set of morphological properties
from nouns , demonstratives , and interrogatives . With regard to the suff ixes
they may accept , nouns marked for number resemble personal pronouns . In other
respects , however , personal pronouns are unique .
First of a l l , only personal pronouns may bear the Possessive suffix -ke ,
described in 6 . 3 . Second , the Obj ect suffix on personal pronouns has the
canonical form -e , subj ect to vowe l harmony ( cf . 2 . 2 . 1 0 ) , and does not exhibit
the sex gender agreement characteristic of the corresponding suffix on other
substantive lexemes . And third , personal pronouns may never bear the Locative/
Direction suffix -e/ke , described in 6 . 5 .

"2.2Mo rphophono l o gyThis section presents a number of ordered rules which together produce most o f
the phonetic forms of Awtuw words from strings of morphemes .
On the whole , the rules apply to verb forms , but where other types of words
meet the environmental criteri a , these rules affect them as wel l . The only
cases o f such rules are one of the vowel harmony rules ( 2 . 2 . 10) , which changes
the canonical lei of the past , future , and obj ect suf f ixes to lrJ or [�J, and
the pre-rhotic stop insertion rule in 2 . 2 . 18 .",[22]
"10. 2 . 2Fu ture compl ement c o n s truc t i o n sThe first three constructions we w i l l b e examining require a verb with future
marking in the nominal clause . These constructions express desire or lack o f
de sire t o d o something , remembering or forgetting to do something , asking o r
tell ing someone t o d o some thing , and purpose . I n each case , the future -marked
verb depicts an action that must take place after the situation depicted by the
matrix verb . This make s the future marking seem semantically natural .
1 . In one o f the se , the covert subj ect o f the nominal clause must be
co-re ferential with the subj ect of the matrix c lause . Although Awtuw lacks an
infinitive form , this bears a close resemblance to an infinitive construction .
In thi s construction , the future verb functions as the complement o f the othe r
verb , as s ignalled by the Obj ect suffix. The Obj e ct-marked verb may have an
obj ect of its own , but it has no overt subj ect as it is neces sarily
co-re ferential with the subj ect of the other verb.
There is a l imited class of roots that can occur as the matrix verb in this
construction , speci fically , a subset of the cognition verbs . This class
include s the two preference verbs , rewrey l � � like and ���� don ' t like, don ' t
want when they mean like/want to and not like/want to .

Perception verbs can also take direct perception complements whose subject is
marked as posses sive . In this case , the complement itse l f serves a s the unique
direct object of the matrix clause .

therefore inclined to mark the clause with the subordination marker .","[163, 164, 165, 166]"

Fami ly . He further classif ies this fami ly within the Upper Sepik Super-stock
of the Sepik Sub-phylum of the Sepik-Ramu Phylum . Whi le the postulated broader
relationships are tentative , there is little doubt that the three Ram Fami ly
languages are c losely related ( c f . Laycock and Z ' Graggen 1977 , Wurm 197 1 ) .
Karawa , with some 53 speakers , is spoken in the vi llage of Bulawa , directly
south of the Awtuw-speaking area , and Bouye , with some 642 speakers , is spoken
in the villages of Giliato , Maurom , Wokien , and Yukilo to the south-west ( see
Map 1 ) .
1 . 2 . 3 Most reports of patrols through the area prior to World War II were
destroyed in air attacks on the administrative centre of Aitape . Some of those
that survive indicate that patrols were conducted near , but probably not
through , the Awtuw-speaking region in the early- to mid-1930s ( McCarthy 193 1 ,
1936- 3 7 , Robinson 1931-34 , c f . Marshal l 1 9 3 7 , 1 9 3 8 ) .
Prior to contact and the establishment of government control over the area ,
there was sporadic fighting among the villages in the area . The most recent
series of conf l i cts , which ended in a permanent armistice around 1950 , involved
the vil lages of Kamlakw and Wiyup on the one side , and Nalpetlape ( Taute) and
Wilkilape (Wi lki l i ) on the othe r .
B y the t ime of World War II , Awtuw speakers were regularly contracting t o do
plantation labour and some served in the armed forces during the war . The
Japanese crossed the Torricellis in the course of the invasion and were
certainly in the village of Se inim, but apparently fai led to penetrate as far
south as Kamlakwlape or Wutlakwlape .
In 1948 , the Franciscan order established their mission at Lumi , the nearest
airstrip to the Awtuw-speaking area , about three and a half hours ' walk north­
east of Kamlakwlape . The government established a patrol post there the
fo llowing year and the Christian Missions in Many Lands ( CMML ) , a Brethren
mission , also set up their mission at Lumi in 1949 . The two missions competed
with each other for the souls of the people in the surrounding area , but
eventually divided the area to their mutual satisfact ion . Don and Ai leen
MacGregor , a CMML couple from New Zealand , staffed the Lumi mission , probably
from its inception , unt i l Don ' s death in 1976 . During this time , Don wrote a
number of papers on the culture of the Wapei people ( MaCGregor 1969 , 1972 ,
1974a , 1974b, 1 9 7 5 ) , and , in collaboration with Ai leen , a sketch of 010 grammar
and a glossary of 010 , a Torricelli Phylum language ( MacGregor and MacGregor
198 2 ) .
In 195 7 , Ken Knight , of the Sola Fide Mission , established himself and his
party of seven to nine people in what is now Me leylape . The hamlet was
inhabited at the time , but since the Knights wanted to bui ld their compound
there , the Meley people moved to a nearby spot on the track to Wutlakw . The
Knights compensated the people thus displaced with a payment of one pound .
The Knights ran a school and a clinic at Meley and left in 1961 for reasons
which I have not been able to determine . The Sola Fide Mission sti ll exists ,
with headquarters in Goroka EHP .
After the Knights ' party left , the CMML took over responsibility for Kamlakw
and the surrounding area . Don MacGregor visited frequently to conduct services .
In the mid- 1960s , the CMML sent a school teacher to Kamlakw , but the hamlet
decided to expel him after a year because they considered him excessively cruel
to the chi ldren .","[9, 10, 11]"

11.3.1N ume ra l sAwtuw has four basic counting numerals . The se combine produc tive ly with y i y l e
hand, r i we foot , and rame man to form numerals a s high a s 4 19 . But in practice ,
Awtuw speakers se ldom use vernacular numerals in excess of 20 .
There are several reasons for this . First , for most purposes , Awtuw speake rs do
l i wke a lot and y a n ke y ke
not concern themse lves with precision of numeration
Second , in counting cash ,
a litt le, few are ordinarily suf ficiently accurate .
Awtuw speakers and the ir ne ighbours use a variety of denominations obviating
the need for large numerals ( see be low 1 1 . 3 . 3 ) . And fina l ly , all Awtuw
speakers are fluent in Tok Pisin and use Tok Pisin numerals freely in all
contexts .

may carry a full set o f arguments and adj uncts . This strategy has three maj or
functions . It is used for inferential perception complements , for indirect
discourse complements , and for indirect cognition complements .
Whatever the semantic function , c lauses of this sort have in common the feature
that the tense of the complement is relative to the tense of the matrix verb .
Thus , if the matrix verb i s present , i . e . unmarked, then an unma rked complement
verb re fers to an event contemporaneous with the speech event , a past
complement verb to an event prior to it, and a future complement verb to an
event subsequent to it .

form in an independent clause . In the latter case it may refer to an event
completed prior to the speech event , in the former , to an event completed prior
to the time indicated by the tense of the complement verb , which is determined
in turn by the tense of the matrix verb .
In example ( 3 4 ) each perfect complement verb indicates that the baking is
complete at the time referred to by the tense . So in ( 3 4a ) , the unmarke d
tense of the complement verb refers to a time contemporaneous with the time
of �� � say .
In ( 34b) , the past tense of the l ! �� r bake refers to a time prior
to the time of the matrix verb , and the perfect indicates that the baking was
completed at that time . And in example ( 34c ) , the perfect of the complement
verb indicates that the baking will be complete at the time referred to by the
future .

they g loss . Example ( 3 5a ) means that they will have finished baking the pig at
a t ime subsequent to the time he said it, which i s o f course prior to the time
of the speech event . Example ( 35b ) means that at some time before he says it ,

relativity of person in the complement, because the narrator relates the act
of perception , speech , or cognition from his or her own point o f view . So , for
example , i f Takiy utters the sentence in example ( 3 6 ) to Yawur , Yawur would
report the speech to Napeyre as in example [ 36a J and to Takiy as in example
[ 36b J .

perception enables the subj ect to infer the situation depicted by the
complement . Thus Kampo in example ( 3 7 ) did not actua l ly observe his father
going , but his observations enabled him to surmise that his father had gone .

"473 . 7 . 1 There are two strategies for compounding noun s . Because of their
similarity to compounding strategies in Sanskrit , I have used the Sanskrit
names to distinguish them .
First , and least productive among the Awtuw compounding strategies , i s the
compound ( c f . Whitney 1960 : 485-487 ) . This strategy compounds two
common nouns to form a third common noun whose meaning i s a coordination of the
two components . Example ( 3 1 ) i l lu strate s the two most common Dvandva compounds .","[52, 53]"
