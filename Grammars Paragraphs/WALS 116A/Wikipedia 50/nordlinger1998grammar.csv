This interrogative particle is not present in my corpus and, since the dialect that Hale
recorded appears to be closer to Gudanji than Wambaya,19 it is possible that the interrogative
particle gayi is present only in Gudanji. However, there is a negative interrogative particle in '
Wambaya present in both my corpus and Hale's notes, and also reported by Chadwick
(1978:99). The form of this particle is wayi and, like the negative particle guyala, it requires
the presence of irrealis marking in the auxiliary. There is some variability as to how sentences
containing this particle are translated into English: either as negative yes/no questions
(examples (7-143), (7-144)); information questions meaning `why not' (7-143); or as simple
positive yes/no questions ((7-145), (7-146)):

NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PRI suspect that the basic use of wayî is in yes/no questions when the speaker is anticipating
a negative reply, and that examples such as (7-145) and (7-146) could probably have been
explained in this way in the contexts in which they were given. The information question
associated with (7-143) could arise for pragmatic reasons: if the speaker asks the question
Aren't you listening? then it might be expected that he/she is also looking for an explanation
why. However, further research is required in order to test this hypothesis and more
accurately determine the meaning of this particle and the contexts of its use.
7.5.2 INFORMATION QUESTIONS
These questions involve the use of an indefinite/interrogative, usually initial in the clause,
that indicates the nature of the information being sought. As in many Australian languages,
indefinite/interrogatives in Wambaya can be used either in interrogative function (e.g. `who',
`what') or as indefinite pronouns (e.g. `someone', `something'). They contain one of five
basic roots: gayinî- `what, who'; inja- `where, which'; yangula `when'; yangulanji `how

In the following example, the secondary predicate (bugayirna ngabulungunya) is in the
nominative case, even though the clause is transitive and the subject is registered with a
transitive subject bound pronoun (and must, therefore, have ergative/locative case). This is
presumably because ergative NPs do not take ergative/locative case marking when fronted
(see §4.4.3).

True secondary predicates, such as those above, are characterised by the fact that the
clause can be seen as the conjunction of two separate predications: one without the secondary
predicate, and the other a nominal clause with the secondary predicate as the nominal
predicate. For example, (7-126) consists of the two propositions Gulugbi ga `She slept' and
Ilijbirna (nagarna) `(She) was alone'. Such constructions can thus be distinguished from the
syntactically similar use of (usually body-part) NPS in constructions of inalienable
possession. Consider the following examples:

hold
He held my hand.
The modifying NP in these examples, like those functioning as secondary predicates, must
agree with the head noun in case. However, unlike example (7-126), (7-134) is not anSyntax of simple sentences197example of a true secondary predicate construction since an attempt to decompose it into two
propositions would give Bagijbi ngin 'I feel sick' and the non-sensical (Ngawurniji) juruma
`I am a stomach'. A further difference between the two constructions in Wambaya is that,
while the modifying NP in secondary predicate constructions must agree with the head noun
in gender and number as well as case, this is not true for examples such as (7-134) and (7135) above. For example, the subject in (7-134) (taken from Text 4 in Appendix A) has
masculine gender, while the nominal juruma `stomach' has vegetable gender. Therefore,
following Evans (1995a), I distinguish between true secondary predicate constructions and
subject/object-construed body-part constructions such as those in (7-134) and (7-135)
respectively.
A small number of verbs subcategorise for secondary predicates on the subject, in which
case the modifying NP is referred to as a subject complement. Verbs requiring subject
complements were discussed in §7.2. For convenience, one example of the reflexive verb
manku `to feel', which subcategorises for a subject complement expressing the emotion
attributed to the subject, is repeated here.

7.5 QUESTIONS
7.5.1 YES/NO QUESTIONS
Yes/no questions usually have the same form as the corresponding declarative sentence,
but are said with a rising, questioning intonation:

Hale's corpus contains examples in which an interrogative particle gayi is used in such
polar yes/no questions. Note that this particle appears in the auxiliary in examples (7-140)
and (7-141), and alone in second position in the verbless clause (7-142):18

7.4.2 SECONDARY PREDICATES
An ascriptive NP can function as a secondary predicate (Nichols 1978) for the subject or
object of a finite clause, in which case, like all nominal modifiers, it must agree in case and
gender (and presumably number, although there are no relevant examples) with the nominal it
modifies. This secondary predicate provides information about the manner or state of the
argument during the time of the main predicate. Theoretically, since these secondary
predicates are adjuncts, any nominal could se rve as a secondary predicate co-occurring with
any verb. Examples of secondary predication follow.

Note that the use of -liji is not obligatory. Thus, example (4-216) could also be expressed
as a simple possessive construction:38It can presumably occur with feminine nouns too (the expected form would he -linea), hut there are no
examples in the corpus.
39 Note that it is only a question of explicitness:. it is quite possible to have this meaning without the use
of -liji. _
40 The auxiliary in this sentence has been ellipsed.",[121]
"7.1.7 MIRRA `SIT' AS A `COPULA'

and contain no verb at all. However, many of these clauses can also contain the verb, tnirra

than the predicate. which can be deleted anaphorically. Thus, we would expect that (example (7-23)), if
given as a response to a question such as 'Where is the dog?', could be simply jalyu-ni 'on the bed'.
Unfortunately the corpus does not contain the data needed to exemplify this.",[195]
"2.2.3.1 INTRAMORPHEMIC CLUSTERS
Word-medial clusters of two consonants a re common in Wambaya. The biconsonantal
clusters that are found in the corpus are shown in Table 2.3. The initial consonant of the
cluster is shown along the vert ical axis, and the second consonant is given along the
horizontal axis. The consonan ts are given in the same order as Hamilton's continuum: labials,
dorsals, laminais and apicals (alveolars and then retroflexes). Within each group the
consonants are given in the order: stop, nasal, liquid, semivowel. Question marks indicate
what may be accidental gaps in the table.",[47]
"58Nominals59(4-4) garngu-nva-rdarra

a big group (of women) (nominative)
Other suffixes, such as the proprietive suffix, attach to the root of some nominals
(example (4-5)) and to the citation form of others (4-6). One possibility is that the root
functions as the stem when the gender of the 'base' nominal is unimportant, but that the
suffix follows the citation form when the gender of the underived noun is relevant. For
example, there may be alternative forms of (4-5) such as ala-jî-ngunya `child-I-PROP.II(NOM)''
meaning 'female with boy child' and ala-nga-ngunya `child-II-PROP.II(NOM)' meaning `female
with girl child'. However, this question will need to be followed up in the field.
(4-5) alag-unya
child-PROP.II(NOM)
female with child
(4-6) mangany-ma-ngunya2
tucker-III-PROP.II(NOM)
female with tucker
These examples suggest that the above nominal template should include a provision in the
root slot for another optional gender marker, with the restriction that it is only filled in some
nominals that contain either the proprietive or privative suffix, or when the -rdarra number
suffix is present. The revised nominal word template would then be as follows:
[Root (+gender)] + (deriv) + (adnom) + (number) + gender + ([Gen + gender]) + (case)
with the same conditions and abbreviations as given above.","[76, 77]"

allative:

Possessive pronouns, like most nominals, have an ergative/absolutive case-marking
system; nominative and accusative case forms are homophonous. Table 4.19 lists the
nominative/accusative forms of the possessive pronouns, which agree in gender, number and
case with the noun that they modify (i.e. the possessed noun). A question mark following a
form indicates that the form has been inferred on the basis of other members of the paradigm,
but is not present in the corpus.

"Nominals1034.5.1.2 REFLEXIVE-POSSESSIVE SUFFIX
The form of this suffix is -liji and it is found only with masculine kinship nouns.38 The
function of this suffix, although not yet fully understood, is apparently to explicitly mark the
fact that the `possessor' of the kin is the subject (as opposed to the speaker, for example).39
Thus, there is an alternation among some kinship terms in the corpus between plain forms, as
given in §123.2, and forms suffixed with -liji. For example:
yarru-warda.
ganggu
(4-211) Ngajbî gin-a
3SG.M.A-PST FF.I(ACC) go-INF
see
He saw grandfather walking (along).
yarru-warda.
ganggu-liji
(4-212) Ngajbî gin-a
3SG.M.A-PST
FF.I-REFL.POSS(ACC)
go-INF
see
He saw his grandfather walking (along).
A sentence such as (4-211) is potentially ambiguous as to whose ganggu is in question:
the subject's or the speaker's (as in `He saw (my) Grandfather walking along'). In example
(4-212), however, the meaning can only be that the subject saw his own ganggu. Thus, -liji
appears to be a reflexive possessive marker, indicating that the possessor of the kin is the
subject Other examples include:
(4-213) Garngujijuwairrigulug-ba. Gabi irr-amany_I(NOM) man.I(NOM) 3PL.S(NP) sleep-FUT NEG 3PL.S-PSTgugu-liji

Importantly, the antecedent for -liji must be third person:

"Comparative discussion of gender marking263the Nungali Class II non-absolutive forms is very neat: Nungali has nganyi-, nyanyi- (ERG)
and ganyi- (DAT) and Wambaya has -nga, -nya and -ga.
There is also a certain degree of similarity among the Class Iv markers. The Class Iv
suffix -ga found with some adjectives in Wambaya, is found as a prefix on Class Iv
demonstratives in Binbinka, and is similar to the Class Iv dative prefixes in Nungali (gi-, gu-)
and the gender base in the Class Iv demonstrative in Jingili: gu-. An original prefix gu- has
been retained in at least two Class iv Wambaya words: gurdurlu `heart' and guyiga `fire',
which are cognate with Nungali dulu and -yug respectively (Bolt, Hoddinott and Kofod
(1971b:143, 145)).
Table B5 contains the gender markers for each language that appear to have
correspondences in one or more of the other languages. In this table many distinctions made
in the more detailed tables above have been collapsed (such as the distinction between
ergative and dative non-absolutive forms in Jingili and Nungali). A question mark indicates
that the form is not known and a gap indicates that there is no correspondence in that
category. For the Binbinka dialect, only the demonstratives' gender markers have been
included; all other markers can be assumed to be the same as for Wambaya.

"160Chapter 6the other inflections of the 0 Class in Garrwa. Another point of comparsion is the Garrwa
`same subject' inflection which is very similar in form to the `same subject' inflection (i.e. the
ergative/locative case) in the J Class in Wambaya: j-ini. This inflection in Wambaya is used
to mark same subject in non-finite clauses that are simultaneous with the main clause (see
§8.1). In Wambaya this inflection is analysed as consisting of the thematic consonant r/,
followed by the epenthetic vowel /i/ and then the ergative/locative case inflection -ni. The
Garrwa inflection also appears to be based on the locative inflection, which is -na in Garrwa
(Belfrage 1992:13). Although it is not unusual for the locative case inflection to be used to
mark same subject in this region (see Austin 1981b), it is interesting here that the two
inflections both precede the locative suffix with the sequence /ji/. In Garrwa however, unlike
Wambaya, the full form -jina is also used with the 0 Class. In Wambaya the form that occurs
with the 0 Class is -ini. There is clearly need for more detailed comparative work between
these two languages.
There are a number of irregular Wambaya verbs which do not belong to either of the two
conjugation classes discussed here. Table 6.4 gives the forms of such verbs that are present
in the corpus, along with the regular verbs daguma `hit' and ngajbi `see' for comparison
(non-italicised). A question mark indicates that the form given is hypothesised, but not
confirmed.

4.6.3 GA SERIES
There is another set of Wambaya forms which complicate the system of demonstratives
discussed above: sometimes these forms seem to act like demonstratives, but at other times
appear to be more like nouns. When behaving like demonstratives, these ga forms54 occur in
place of the remote forms. The use of these forms is so common that Chadwick (1978) gives
the dual and plural forms as the only remote dual and plural Class I and II demonstratives in
Wambaya. These forms are as follows:55
Class I NOM/ACC SG
igima

yagagunja
In form, these appear to be demonstratives: all forms contain the appropriate gender prefix:
i (I), na- (Il) and ya- (Iv); and the plural suffix that is used (-gunji/-gunya) is that which occurs
with demonstratives, not with nouns (see §4.3 for a discussion of number marking on
nouns). However, igima and nagarna, which are extremely common, are translated by
speakers as meaning `boy' and `girl' respectively and often seem to be functioning more like
nouns than demonstratives. Consider the examples below.
In examples (4-242) and (4-243) it is not clear whether the forms in question are functioning
as nouns or as demonstratives. However, particularly in (4-242) — the opening line of Text 6,
in which there is modification by adjectives — they seem to be rather noun-like in function.","[134, 135]"

Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language originally spoken in the Barkly Tablelands
region of the Northern Territory, Australia. There are perhaps 8-10 fluent speakers
remaining, most of whom live in Tennant Creek and Elliott in the Northern Territory. The
linguistic work which led to this volume was initiated by the Wambaya community (through
the Gurungu Council Aboriginal Corporation in Elliott) out of an increasing concern for the
fate of their language as these few remaining speakers get older. It is hoped that this
(ongoing) work will help younger Wambaya speakers learn something of their language
now, and have some access to their language even when it is no longer being spoken around
them.
While the main focus of this work has been on Wambaya, substantial reference has also
been made throughout the text to the mutually intelligible dialect Gudanji. The close and longterm interaction between the Wambaya and Gudanji communities makes it virtually
impossible to work on one dialect without working on the other. Furthermore, the similarly
small number of remaining Gudanji speakers makes any work on this dialect equally urgent.
The research for this grammar was conducted during six field trips, totalling over seven
months, from February 1991 to August 1994. Work was begun in Elliott, N.T., and then, as
many Elliott Wambaya moved to Tennant Creek, was continued there. There was a lot of
support for the project from the Wambaya/Gudanji people of both Elliott and Tennant Creek.
Although people were not always able to to help me with language material, help came in
many different forms: from helping with the elicitation and transcription of stories, to
providing access to computers and office space, to providing company for the many hours
spent driving between Elliott and Tennant Creek.
This grammar is a revised version of my Melbourne University MA thesis (Nordlinger
1993a). The revisions include the reanalysis of some earlier analyses (e.g. the treatment of
complex clauses in Chapter 8), and the inclusion of new data collected since the MA thesis
was submitted (e.g. the causal suffix in §4.4.9). Unfortunately, the constraints of time have
made it impossible to cover all areas of Wambaya grammar in the same amount of detail.
Wambaya is a morphologically complex language, and thus these aspects of the grammar
have been given the most attention (Chapters 4-6); other areas have been given less coverage
than they deserve (e.g. complex sentences); and still others have been left out altogether (e.g.
prosody, discourse). Throughout the text I have indicated areas in which more work is
needed in the hope that it can be carried out in the future.
This grammar is written as a reference grammar. I have therefore deliberately avoided
presenting the data in any particular theoretical framework, or devoting much discussion to
the interesting issues raised by aspects of Wambaya grammar for current theoretical research.
Instead I have tried to describe this interesting language in its own terms, using a substantial
number of naturally occurring examples and texts. My belief is that this will give the
grammatical description the best chance of standing the test of time, and readers the best
chance of discovering things in the language that I have not, perhaps even inspiring more
work on Wambaya before it is too late.xiACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.
My greatest debt is to the Wambaya people who welcomed me into their community and
taught me, so patiently, what I know of their language. In particular I would like to thank my
friends and language teachers, Molly Nurlanyma Grueman, Minnie Niyamarrama Nimara,
Mavis Bangarinya Hogan and Powder Bangarinji O'Keefe (Gudanji) for their never-ending
cooperation, tolerance and patience. They cheerfully shared with me their language and their
stories, answered my questions, and corrected my mistakes. For their support and friendship
I would also like to thank many other people from Elliott and Tennant Creek, including:
Florine Bathern, Ivy Duncan, Amy and Jeffrey Dixon, Billy Hayes, Sandra Hogan, Judy
Holt, Ian Hopwood, Michael Neade, Penny Watson, Heather Wilson and Oscar Wilson; all
of the people who participated in the Wambaya literacy workshop in Tennant Creek in April
1993; and, especially, Moana Strauss for generously sharing her flat and car during my
months of fieldwork. The Gurungu Council in Elliott, who initiated this project, helped
enormously in obtaining funding for my visits and was always cooperative, as was the
Papulu Apparr-kari language centre in Tennant Creek.
A very special thanks goes to. Nick Evans, who was a dedicated and enthusiastic MA
supervisor, and who first got me interested in working on Australian languages. Without his
invaluable advice, support and encouragement this project might never have got off the
ground. Robert Hoogenraad provided general encouragement and help in the field and I was
also fortunate enough to spend some time in the field with Luise Hercus, David Nash and
Gavan Breen, whose kind support and advice were most appreciated. Many thanks are due
also to John Henderson and Robert Hoogenraad, who provided much-needed computer
assistance. For insightful comments on various aspects of this grammar I am indebted to
Peter Austin, Juliette Blevins, Joan Bresnan, Margaret Carew, Ian Green, John Hajek and
Lesley Stirling. In particular, my revisions to this grammar have benefited enormously from
the comments and suggestions of my two MA examiners, Bill McGregor and Jane Simpson.
Of course, none of these people can be held responsible for any of the remaining flaws or
inadequacies.
This project would not have been possible without the financial support of the Australian
Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies grant L91/4100, and the Australian
Research Council grant A58930745 (awarded to Nick Evans) entitled 'Non-Pama-Nyungan
languages of Northern Australia: descriptive, grammatical, comparative and sociolinguistic
investigations'. Funding for an additional field trip in 1994 was provided by the Centre for
the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University, with the help of Peter Sells
and Stanley Peters. I thank all these people and organisations for their generous support.
My heartfelt thanks go to Dean Robinson, who stood by me throughout this project and
put up with my many moods and absences. My family and friends also provided much
valued support and encouragement. I thank them all for their patience and understanding.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

Adjoined clauses can function as clausal arguments of main clause verbs of speech or
perception such as îlinga 'hear, remember SCOMP', didima `tell (0) that SCOMP' and janganja
or bajiya `ask (0) (if) SCOMP'. In these constructions the subordinate clause always follows
the main clause. An example is:
yarru].
[injani g-a
ilinga
(8-47) Guyala ng-udi
NEG
ISG.A-NACT.PR remember where 3SG.S-PST go
I can't remember where he went.
With speech verbs the argument clause is usually an indirect speech quotation in which the
speaker paraphrases the utterance being reported (examples (8-48), (8-49)). When it is the
argument of janganja or bajiya, both of which mean `ask', the finite clause is usually
translated with a concealed question ((8-50), (8-51)).

(iii) Free Pronouns
Free pronouns form a small, closed class. They are referred to as 'free' to differentiate
them from the 'bound' pronouns that form part of the auxiliary (discussed below). Free
pronouns distinguish person (first, second and third), number (singular, dual and plural) and.
make an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first person non-singular. There are no third
person singular subject or object pronouns; demonstratives are used instead.
Free pronouns have a different system of case marking from nouns and adjectives. While
nouns and adjectives have an ergative/absolutive system of case marking, free pronouns have
a nominative/accusative declension with nominative and ergative case forms being
homophonous- Free pronouns also have an oblique form which is used in the dative case and
as the base for the addition of other case suffixes such as the comitative. In the case of nonsingular pronouns, this oblique form is homophonous with the accusative case form.aIt is interesting to consider the possible relationship between the verbs and their corresponding adjectives.
The final jbi of the adjective gurijbi (and also bagijbi) is identical to a final sequence that in Wambaya is
quite distinctively verbal. There are many verbs that have this form: ngajbi 'see', gajbi 'eat', nyagajbi 'be
tired', and it is also found in verbs derived from adjectives with the inchoative suffix jbi: yarduga
'strong' (Iv) becomes varduga jbi 'become strong' (see §6.2.2.1). This suggests that the adjective gurijbi
may be derived from the verb gurijbi, thereby accounting for its verb-like form. This theory is supported
by the other gender forms of the adjective which are all based on this (verbal) form. The usual case
among adjectives is for the Class iv form to he identical to the root, and therefore to serve as the base for
the derivation of the other gender forms (see §4.2.2). However with gurijbi it is the Class I form (which
is identical to the verbal form) from which the other forms are derived. This is shown most clearly by the
Class II form gurijbi-rna in which the Class Ii gender suffix is simply added on to the full Class I form.
The situation with bagijbi is different in at least two respects. Firstly, there is some variation among
speakers as to whether the Class I form of the adjective is correctly pronounced bagijbi or bagiji. For
some speakers either form is possible, for others only the latter is possible as the Class I form of the
adjective. And secondly, the other gender forms are not derived from the Class I (and verbal) form, as is
the case with gurijbi, but are clearly all derived (quite regularly) from a common root bagig - :
Class I
bagiji/(bagijbi)
Class 11 bagi-nga
Class III baging-ma
Class Iv bagi-ga
The verbal form bagijbi is clearly also derived from this root.
The next question is why, if the Class I form of the adjective is actually bagiji, it is often pronounced
bagijbi, which is the verbal form? It seems quite probable that this could have happened on analogy with
gurijbi, particularly as it is quite common in fast speech for both gurijbi and bagijbi to he pronounced
guriji and bagiji respectively (even for the verbal form).",[67]
"32Chapter 2consonant has a value that is lower than or equal to that of the first on the sonority hierarchy:
OBSTRUENT<NASAL<LIQUID<GLIDE.21 This explains, for example, why it is that nasal—stop
clusters are possible, but stop-nasal clusters are not. There are three exceptions to this
principle, all of which contain a liquid followed by a glide (glides are higher on the sonority
hierarchy than liquids). Thus /rrw/, /lw/, /rlw/ all contravene the above-mentioned principle
of relative sonority for consonant clusters.
The principles governing well-formed consonant clusters in Wambaya can be formulated
as follows ((i)-(iv) are taken from the above discussion, (v)-(vii) are additional constraints
evident in Table 2.3):
(i) All homorganic nasal—stop clusters are well-formed.
(ii) The first member of a consonant cluster (excluding those in (i)) must be higher than the
second member of the cluster on the following hierarchy (from Hamilton 1995):
LABIAL<DORSAL<LAMINAL<APICAL(iii) Despite the possibilities predicted by (ii), a laminal can occur only as the second
element of a cluster (excluding those in (i)) if it is preceded by a retroflex stop or nasal.
(iv) The first member of a consonant cluster must have a value higher than or equal to the
second member on the following sonority hierarchy (from Clements 1990):
OB STRUENT<NASAL<LIQUID<GLIDE(v) As an exception to (iv), clusters containing a liquid followed by the glide /w/ are wellformed.
(vi) A lateral can be the initial member in a consonant cluster only if it is followed by a
peripheral stop or the glide /w/.
(vii) Neither /ly/, /y/ nor In can occur in a consonant cluster.
These seven principles account for the well-formedness of all of the clusters contained in
Table 2.3 as well as the ill-formedness of those corresponding to empty cells. The only
exceptions to this are the cells containing question marks which possibly reflect accidental
gaps in the corpus.
This discussion of consonant clusters has so far centred only on clusters containing two
consonants. However, there is one tri-consonantal cluster (/rrgb/) found in Wambaya. This
cluster is found only in a small number of Wambaya words (in a sample of over 1200 words
only 5 contain this tri-consonantal cluster intramorphemically). Examples of this cluster are:
bunjurrgbarra
burrgbanju
lurrgbanyî
milîrrgbarna
gurrgbarrabend down (towards)
blow (on)
grab, abduct
blue tongue lizard
stare21 As given in Clements (1990). Note that the Wambaya pattern conforms with the Syllable Contact Law
(Murray and Vennemann 1983) stated in Clements (1990:287) as follows:
In any sequence Ca $ Cb there is a preference for Ca to exceed Cb in sonority.","[49, 50]"
"12Chapter 1a little puzzling as it contains the Southwestern prefixes, but has a root which is similar to a
form belonging to McConvell's Proto-Northeastern set of subsection terms, *purlany.
The reconstructed forms to which bangarinji/bangarinya and balyarrinjilbalyarrinya are
related are common to both the Proto Southwestern and Proto Northeastern sets; however,
the absence of gender prefixes in the Wambaya reflexes suggest that they may have come
from the north-east, rather than the south-west. Yagamarri/yagamarrirna is not clearly related
to the pragmatically equivalent Proto Southwestern or Proto Northeastern forms but may be
derived from the same root as jiyanrarrama/niyarrutrrama, which is *l amarra in both sets of
prototerms. Note that these two subsections would belong to the one section in a section
system (such as the Kariera system). One possibility is that Wambaya has borrowed
jîyamarrama/niyamarrama from its southern neighbours and yagantarri/yagamarrirna from its
northern neighbours.23 Interestingly, the pairs of terms that are suggested here as corning
from the north-east, as opposed to the south-west, do not correspond with the structure of
either a section system or a moiety system. This would suggest that the borrowing of
subsection terms from either the north-east or the south-west into Wambaya has not been on a
completely systematic basis.
Table 1.3 only shows first-choice marriage partners. A man's first-choice marriage partner
is someone who belongs to the same subsection as his mother's mother's brother's
daughter's daughter (i.e. his second cross-cousin). However, this is not his only possible
marriage partner; there are second- and third-choice partners also. A man's second-choice
marriage partner is someone in the same subsection as his mother's mother and his thirdchoice is someone in the same subsection as his father's sister's daughter (i.e. his first crosscousin).24
For example, Bangarinji's first choice is Yagamarrirna (as his mother is Nurrulana whose
mother is Balyarrinya whose brother is Balyarrinji whose daughter is Nurlanyma whose
daughter is Yagamarrîrna). His second choice is Balyarrinya (as his mother is Nun-ulama
whose mother is Balyarrinya). His third choice is Niyamarrarna (as his father is Jiyinanta
whose sister is Niyinama whose daughter is Niyarnarrama).
As noted above, five of the subsections have alternative forms which differ only in the
final syllable(s): the first set of forms have final -ma for both male and female terms, as
opposed to the second set which have final -gu (male) or -gurna (female). Speakers claim that
there is no difference between these two sets and that they are simply alternative Wambaya
forms. However, it is the first set that is most frequently used and I suspect that the second
set (those in parentheses in Table 1.3) belong to another of the Eastern Group languages/
dialects. This is supported by the fact that Spencer and Gillen (1904) give terms similar to
these as the subsection terms for `Gnanji' (Ngarnga). The 'Binbingha' (Binbinka) subsection
terms given in Mathews (1908) also appear to be the same forms. These sets of terms are
given in Tables 1.4 and 1.5 below, with the corresponding term from Table 1.3 given in
italics.","[29, 30]"
"200Chapter 7The constructions are primarily distinguished by the form of the negative particle —
yangula or guyala — which appears in initial position in the clause.20 Guyala is also used
alone to mean `no, nothing'; yangula is never used in this function. There is one other respect
in which the two constructions differ: while both particles (usually) require the presence of
the hypothetical suffix in the auxiliary in future clauses, only guyala has the further
requirement that the auxiliary contain an irrealis mood suffix in past and present tense
clauses. In past and present tense clauses with yangula the auxiliary has the same form that it
would in the corresponding positive sentence. Examples include the following. Note that in
future tense negative clauses the verb does not inflect for future tense (see §6.1.2):
(7-155) Guyala ng-uda
NEGgajbî manganyma.","[217, 218]"
"Given the similarities between the West Barkly gender suffixes and the Nungali prefixes it
is quite clear that they have derived from a single system. The interesting question, therefore,
is how they became suffixes in the West Barkly languages and prefixes in Nungali. There are
three different possibilities. Firstly, Chadwick (1978:336ff) proposes that the gender suffixes
of the modem West Barkly languages developed from ""postposed markers not previously264Appendix Battached to the noun stem and simpler in form than the present suffixes"" (p.336). However,
this analysis does not account for why the demonstratives should have gender prefixes and
not suffixes. A second possible analysis is that the gender suffixes, or at least the postposed
gender markers, developed from the reduction of postposed demonstratives. The strongest
argument for this analysis is that it accounts for the absence of gender suffixes on
demonstratives themselves:8 we would not expect demonstratives to be postposed to
demonstratives. A third proposal, suggested by Ian Green (1995:421) combines both of these
two ideas. Green suggests that in Proto Mirndi the precursors of the present-day case
markers were in fact postposed to the nominals as separate words, as Chadwick suggests.
However, he also argues that Proto Mirndi at the same time had gender-prefixed
demonstratives which alternated with these postposed gender markers (these gender markers
belonging to the overall demonstrative paradigm), thus explaining why the demonstratives
did not acquire gender suffixes also. In the West Barkly languages, then, these postposed
markers became fused with the noun stems as suffixes, and in Nungali these developed into
prefixes on following modifers, later being also extended to head nouns. It may not be
possible to find evidence that would distinguish my proposal from Green's, although further
research is clearly required.
In support of either of the latter two proposals is the strong similarity between the form of
the demonstrative gender prefixes and form of the pre-modern gender markers that Chadwick
reconstructs for the Eastern Group:
Eastern Group pre-modern gender markers (from Chadwick 1978:336)
IIIIIIIVma ma a, u
Ji
Ni nga
(Where Ji denotes either ji or yi and Ni either nî or mi.)
ABS
NABSExcept for Class IV, the forms of these markers are exactly the same as the Wambaya
prefixes found on demonstratives, and are also the same as the underlying gender suffixes
found with other nominals. The existence of Class Iv suffixes in Wambaya such as -ga and
-ja, as well as the demonstrative prefix ya-, suggests that the original Class IV marker may
have had an initial consonant, probably /g/. This is supported by the residual gu- prefix in
some Class iv forms (see above), the Binbinka Class Iv demonstrative prefix ga- and the
Class Iv demonstrative base in Jingili: -gu. Chadwick remains undecided as to whether the
pre-modern Class I absolutive marker should be reconstructed as jî or as yî. The fact that the
prefix ji- is found on some Class I demonstratives in Binbinka, and that it appears to be the
underlying Class I absolutive gender suffix on Wambaya nominals (see §4.2.2), suggests
that it may be better reconstructed as ji, with modern day (y)i forms (such as on Wambaya
demonstratives) having derived from ji by lenition of the initial consonant.","[281, 282]"
"There is some inconsistency in the corpus as to the form of the noun to which the
proprietive suffix is affixed. The usual case is simply to add it to the full citation form of the
noun (including the gender suffix). Thus:
(4-161) manganyma-nguja
tucker. II-PROP.IV (NOM)tucker-having (Iv)
(4-162) janjî-ngunya33
dog.I-PROP.II(NOM)dog-having (II)
However, in other examples it seems that the proprietive suffix is added to a nominal root.
In these examples the root ends in /g/ and the initial consonant of the suffix is omitted:
(4-163) alag-unya
child-PROP.II(NOM)
pregnant (1)(citation form of noun: alaji (I) or alanga (II))(4-164) garlangg-uja(citation form of noun: garlangga (IV))sand-PROP.IV(NOM)sand-having (IV)
For some nouns either alternative is possible. For example, the proprietive form of
marnarrga `mud' (IV) (here with Class II agreement) was given in two different ways:33 It would be interesting to see whether this form would contrast with a form janya-ngunya `dog.ttPROP.n(NOt )' , in which the dog is marked as female and not male. This is something that needs to be
checked in the field.",[113]
"7.6.1.2 NEGATION OF IMPERATIVE CLAUSES
Imperative clauses are negated with the use of the negative imperative particle alyu
(glossed `NEG.IMP') which must always be initial in the clause.25 In negative imperative
clauses the auxiliary (when present) appears in the non-future tense form and the verb can24 It is interesting that, given this semantic difference, it is guyala rather than yangula that is used as aninterjection with the meaning 'no, nothing'. This may be due to politeness: in the face of a request. it is
more polite to suggest that the reason for saying 'no' is beyond one's control than to simply refuse (e.g.
I can 't versus I won't).
25 The Gudanji negative imperative particle is durdami. Note that, unlike in Wambaya (see §5.5).
imperative clauses in Gudanji always have an auxiliary even when singular. Thus in a typical singular
negative imperative clause, durdami is followed by the auxiliary nya.",[220]
"NEG1 SG.A-NACT.PRThis semantic difference between the two particles helps to explain their different
behaviour with respect to the irrealis markers in the auxiliary. If guyala is a negative modal
expressing `unlikelihood' then it is not surprising that it should require an irrealis marker in
the auxiliary, since these markers are often used to express modal meanings of `should' and
`would' in positive (usually counterfactual) sentences (see §5.2.4).24
Verbless clauses are also negated with either guyala or yangula, although of the few
examples in the corpus most contain guyala. As shown in the following examples, the
negative particle may be either initial in the clause (example (7-173)) or initial in the predicate
(7-174).
(7-173) Guyala Mama
NEGngangijugu,Mamathat.I.SG.NOM 2SG.POSS.I(NOM) MB.I(NOM) that.LSG.NOMngangîgugu.",[220]
"Parts of speech and other preliminaries533.1.2.2 PARTICLES
There are only a few particles in Wambaya. Particles have grammatical functions, such as
marking yes/no interrogative clauses, marking negation in declarative and imperative clauses,
and linking two finite clauses into a single complex clause. They are formally distinguished
from adverbs as they have strict positional restrictions: particles almost always occur in initial
position. Particles are discussed in §7.7.2.
3.1.2.3 arms
Clitics can be distinguished from other non-inflecting word classes as they are bound
forms; they can not stand alone as words.10 There are three clitics in the corpus: =miji, =nima
and =minyi. Miji (glossed INFER') expresses epistemic mood; it indicates that the speaker
considers the proposition to be probable or possible, but does not know for sure whether or
not it is actual. It is an unrestricted clitic and is always encliticised to the initial word of the
clause. Nîma (glossed `NST') can usually be translated by English words such as `just',
`only' and `still', although in some examples it seems to have an emphatic function. It is a
restricted clitic which usually occurs with nominals, although it can also occur with verbs and
other word classes. The other clitic, =minyi (glossed `AGAIN'), is used only with verbs. It is
encliticised to the verb over which it has scope. These three clitics are discussed and
exemplified in §7.7.1.
3.1.2.4 INTERJECTIONS
There are only a small number of interjections in Wambaya. Interjections can constitute a
complete utterance on their own and are therefore distinguished from word classes such as
adverbs and particles. Examples of interjections in Wambaya include gunku `I/we don't
know', guyala `no, nothing' and alima `OK, goodbye'.
Note that guyala functions both as an interjection meaning `no, nothing' and as a particle
negating a clause, as in guyala nguda yarru `I didn't go'. This is the only other exception to
the mutually exclusivity of word class membership. Interestingly Evans (1995a:87) gives
warirra `nothing' as the only Kayardild word that may belong to more than one word class,
serving both as a nominal and an interjection.' 1
3.2 GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
3.2.1 CORE FUNCTIONS, ADJUNCTS AND COMPLEMENTS
Grammatical relations (or grammatical functions), such as subject, object, indirect object,
complement and adjunct, are important in describing many syntactic and morphological
10 Note that the auxiliary is essentially a bundle of clitics. However, its special status in Wambaya
grammar warrants its treatment as a distinct part of speech.
1 l Bill McGregor (pers.comm.) points out that the possible use of guyala as an interjection does not
necessarily justify the claim that it belongs to more than one word class since it is not uncommon in
languages for words of other classes to be used as complete utterances of their own, as in the use of
`Man!' in English, for example. However, the two uses of guyala have different characteristics — as a
particle, for example, guyala must co-occur with counter-factual mood marking in the auxiliary (see
§7.6.I.1)— and thus are considered members of different word classes here.","[70, 71]"
"These are the Warumungu baby-talk term (Heath and Simpson 1982:4) and the Yukulta term (Sharp,
cited in McConvell 1985:28) respectively.

female and jV- for male) and have final -ma, and those that mark it with a suffix (e.g.
ban garinji/bangarinya, balyarrinji/balyarrinya and yagamarri/yagamarrirna). It is only the
terms of the first type that have the alternative forms, which substitute either -gu (male) or
-gurna (female) for -ma . In these alternative forms gender is marked both by prefix and by
suffix.
The Wambaya subsection terms do not fit neatly with the different sets of terms discussed
by McConvell (1985) and appear to be a mix of his Proto-Southwestern and ProtoNortheastern sets of terms 2 2 As Wambaya is geographically between both groups, that they
may have borrowed some terms from each is perhaps not surprising. The gender prefixes jV(male) and nV- (female) present in five pairs of forms are clearly related to the gender
prefixes in McConvell's (p.29) Proto Southwestern forms: *ja- and *na-. Of the five pairs of
terms that have these prefixes, four have roots which also appear to be related to the
corresponding Proto Southwestern forms reconstructed by McConvell: jiyinama/niyinama
(*-panangkn). jurrulcrrna/nurrulama (* purrurla), jangalama/nangalama (*-ngala) and
jîtiamarrama/niyamarrama (*kamarra). However, one prefixed pair, jurlanynur/nurlanynra, is22 Note that the following discussion is purely impressionistic and should be taken as speculative.","[28, 29]"
"The hypothetical suffix is the future tense counterpart of the non-actual suffixes in negative
clauses, co-occuring with the negative particles guyala and yangula in negative future tense
constructions:1613 This is the analysis implicit in Hale's description (1959:ií) and suggested by Jane Simpson (pers.
comm.).
14 As pointed out by Jane Simpson (pers. comm.), the fact that -u is used in polite imperatives may be
further support for its general irrealis function: irrealis is often used for politeness, as demonstrated by
the Aboriginal English ""You might do X for me"" or ""Might be we do X"".
15 In Chadwick (1978) and Nordlinger (1993a), this suffix is considered to he a future tense irrealis suffix.
However, it is not clear how an future tense irrealis suffix would differ from the simple future tense
suffix — all future tense constructions being, by definition, irrealis — and thus the analysis given here is
preferred.
16 Note that this is slightly different from the non-actual suffixes, which are found in negative constructions
containing the negative particle guyala only; they do not co-occur with the negative particle yanRula. For
a more detailed discussion of negation see §7.6.",[168]
"The language and its speakersthere has been a greater degree of mixing of the two dialects in recent years, however, comes
from a 1987 file note from Papulu Apparr-kari, the language centre in Tennant Creek. In this
note, one old (now deceased) Wambaya man is reported as claiming that there are only two ,
fluent Wambaya speakers left (of which he was one) as all the other speakers have mixed the
language up with Gudanji.
All of the competent speakers of Wambaya and Gudanji are over about 55 years old, and
most of them would be over 60. There are a couple of people under 55 (perhaps in their 40s)
who have a good command of Wambaya, although in speaking it they tend to substitute a
number of grammatical elements from Kriol. Most of the people that I have met over the age
of about 40 have a reasonably good to excellent passive knowledge of Wambaya or Gudanji
but rarely speak it. None of the younger generations can speak the language at all, apart from
the subsection terms, kinship terms and some selected lexical items. Only a few people that I
met under about 30 could even understand sentences spoken to them in Wambaya or
Gudanji. There is, however, some interest among some of the younger people in learning to
read an d write Wambaya, with the intention of possibly teaching some to the children in
school.' 9
The usual language of communication for all of these people, including the older ones, is a
variety of Kriol or English ranging from quite a basilectal variety of Kriol among the older
speakers to something closer to Aboriginal English among the younger ones. For most of the
people this is their first (and only) language.
1.2.3 SOCIAL ORGANISATION
1.2.3.1 THE SUBSECTION SYSTEM
Wambaya society is divided into a system of eight subsections, or `skins', according to
which marriage and all other relationships are determined. Brothers and sisters belong to the
same subsection, which is determined matrilineally. This system is demonstrated in Table 1.3
below. There are two sets of terms for most subsections; the less common term for each
subsection is given in parentheses. The difference between these two sets of terms is
discussed below. The subsections have different, although closely related, names for their
male and female members; in Table 1.3 female terms are given in bold. An equals sign
indicates a first-choice marriage partner, the outside arrows trace matrilineal descent, and the
broken lines in the centre show patrilineal descent. An alternative representation of this
system is given in Figure 1.1.","[26, 27]"
"The distribution of the future verbal suffix, which is found in imperative clauses and
positive future tense clauses, suggests that `future tense' may not be the best characterisation
of the function of this suffix. It is also not possible to treat it as a general irrealis mood suffix,
since it is not found in negative future tense clauses, nor in examples in which an irrealis
mood suffix appears on the auxiliary (see §5.2.4). The function of this suffix is complex and
still not fully understood and thus, in lieu of further research, I will refer to it as the `future
tense' suffix, while acknowledging the term's inadequacies. See Nordlinger (1996) for
further discussion.
6.1.3 INFINITIVE SUFFIX
The form of the infinitive suffix is -barda, or -warda following liquids and /u/. With two
verbs it has the irregular form -arda: nanganangali `sneak away' > nanganangal-arda `sneak
away-INF'; gajurru `dance' > gajurr-arda `dance-INF'. The infinitive suffix occurs with verbs
in non-finite subordinate clauses and is discussed in more detail in §8.1. Some examples of
its use are:
(6-21)Ngaj-bi ngî-ny-ayarru-warda.see-NF 1 SG.A-20-PST go-INF
I saw you walking along.",[182]
"Syntax of simple sentences1877.2.5 TRANSITIVE VERBS
Transitive verbs are characterised by the fact that they subcategorise for an ergative subject
argument and only one other obligatory object argument (in this respect they differ from
ditransitive verbs which require two object-type arguments).
7.2.5.1 SIMPLE TRANSITIVE VERBS
Most of the transitive verbs are of this type; they subcategorise for an ergative subject NP
and an accusative object NP. It is very difficult to generalise about the semantic characteristics
of simple transitive verbs as they are great in number and varied in meaning. Some examples
are verbs of (i) physical impact or effect (whether desirable or undesirable), such as daguma
'hit O', anmurru `cuddle o',: burlurlandu `blow o away, blow O about', dudiyarri `spear 0',
jarungbî 'kiss O', angbardî 'build O', wugbardi `cook O' mujumi 'gather O'; (ii) perception,.
such as bujanga 'perceive smell of O', ngajbi 'see O, look at O', manku 'hear o, listen to o,
remember O'; (iii) transport, as in didija `carry O on hip', nyanyuwa `collect 0'; (iv)
movement, in which the verb describes the relationship between the movement of two
referents, such as nyurrunyurru `chase O', bardganyî 'follow O', jarrgi 'track O', dunkala
'chase O away', lurrgbanyi 'grab O'; and others such as yabu 'take O, have O', jiyanggi
`know O', gamijanga laugh at', janyî `answer O' and gurdumî 'be too noisy for O'.

"76 Chapter 4
4.3.2.3 THE USE OF SINGULAR FOR DUAL
Example (4-24) above shows the use of singular nominals in dual NPs. There are another
two similar examples in the corpus in which a dual noun phrase is treated formally as if it
were singular. In both of these examples the dual number of the referent of the NP is quite
clear from the semantics of the whole phrase. These noun phrases are probably best
translated as `pair of X':
(4-41) Dîrdibila înîyagajugulî!clap.FUT that.I.SG.ACC boomerang.I(ACC)Clap the (pair of) boomerangs!
(4-42) Dirdîbila yanîyaga
danmuga!
clap.FUT that.IV.SG.ACC clapping.stick.IV(ACC)
Clap the (pair of) clapping sticks!
Thus, it would seem that the singular form can be used in dual NPs when the referents of the
NP form a natural pair as do shoes (example (4-24)), clapping sticks and boomerangs (in the
context of clapping them together).
4.3.3 PLURAL
The marking of plural number is not obligatory; if the plurality of the nominal is not
considered important, the nominal can be left unmarked (i.e. left in the singular/general
form). Example (4-21), repeated from above, provides an example:
jîgama.
Gajbi ng-a
1 SG.A-PST yam.III(ACC)
eat
I ate a/some bush yam(s).
However, there are often situations where the speaker does wish to explicitly mark the NP
as having plural number, and in Wambaya this can be done either with the use of a plural
suffix, or with the use of a free-form numeral. I will begin with a discussion of the plural
suffixes, and will then discuss the use of numerals.
4.3.3.1 THE PLURAL SUFFIXES
There are two plural suffixes that are used with nouns, adjectives and suffixes in the
corpus.21 The two forms are completely different and appear to be in complementary
distribution: in my corpus, -marnda- occurs with vowel-final roots and -bala- with
consonant-final roots, although there is no obvious phonological reason why this should be
the case. The forms of the two suffixes are given in Table 4.5, and their distribution in the
present corpus is given in Table 4.6. Note that, unlike the dual suffix, these plural suffixes
indicate gender, using regular gender suffixes (-i Class I, -rna Class H and -0 Class Iv).
However, there appears to be a gap for Class III: there are no Class III forms in my corpus,
nor do Chadwick (1978) or Hale (1959) provide any.2221 There is also another plural suffix -guny- which is used with demonstratives and indefinite/interrogatives
and is discussed in §4.6.
22 The few Class In plural NPS that Hale (1959) gives contain the `GROUP' suffix -rdarra rather than either of
the plural suffi xes discussed here — see §4.3.3.4.","[93, 94]"

than derived (at least, synchronically) as the meanings are sufficiently different from the nonreflexive forms to consider them to be different lexemes synchronically. A derived reflexive
form of transitive manku, for example, would mean `hear oneself, think about oneself' and
would not subcategorise for the type of subject complement present in example (7-66) above.",[203]
"The future tense inflection is used both in imperative constructions (as discussed above)
and in future tense constructions (examples (6-5) and (6-6)). In clauses with immediate future
tense however, and in negative future tense clauses, the verb occurs in the non-future form.

"Wambaya is alone among the McArthur dialects in inflecting the verb for tense: in neither Gudanji nor
Binbinka is the verb inflected in main clauses (Chadwick 1978:84). In Ngarnga, the verb also shows a
future/non-future contrast: however, interestingly, the basic verb form (i.e. that which corresponds to the
non-future verb form in Wambaya) is used in the future tense, while verbs in past and present tenses are
inflected with the suffix -ani (p.85).
The thematic
of 7 Class verbs also appears before derivational suffixes such as -barli- 'AGNT' and
-baja- 'PRIV'. For example:
dag
j-moi hit-TH-AGNT (I)
daguma j-baji
hit-TH-PRIV (I)
The non-future tense form of a verb is also the citation form, and thus is more like a general unmarked
form (see below).",[175]
"When attached directly to one of the plural subject bound pronouns ngirri ` I PL.EXC', girri

girrija 2PL.S/A-NACT.PST

3PL.S/A-NACT.PR

future tense suffix, see §5.2.1) and a tense component: -di/-ji 'present tense', -da/-ja `past150Chapter 5tense'.13 This suggests that -u may be a more general irrealis marker, interpreted as a future
tense marker when no further inflection is present. For simplicity, however, and since future
tense is now its primary function in Wambaya, I will continue to gloss the suffix -u as 'FUT',
and will treat the non-actual suffixes as portmanteau morphemes, as in the examples above.l 4
The non-actual suffixes are most commonly used with the negative particle guyala
(examples (5-53), (5-55), (5-57), (5-58)). They can also be used without guyala however, to
indicate that something that was not done should have been done (5-54), (5-59) or that
something would have been done in a hypothetical situation (5-56). They can also be used to
express the meaning of `want' (with the implication that what is wanted is not possible):

"The small number of examples of these vowels, and the absence of minimal pairs in which
they contrast with the corresponding short vowels, suggests that they are not an original part
of the Wambaya phonemic system. These vowels may have derived from an original
sequence of vowel—semivowel—vowel, from which the semivowel was dropped (in fact this
is known to be the case for ngirnii; see below). These vowels are discussed further in §2.1.4.

7.6.2.1 THE USE OF THE PRIVATIVE SUFFIX
The privative suffix can be added to a verb X to derive a nominal with the meaning `one

Examples of the use of this suffix with verbs are given in §4.4.12. Some others are given
here for further exemplification.

7.6.2.2 NP NEGATION
There are a few different techniques for negating the presence or existence of an entity.
Most commonly, the derived nominal guyaliny- is used, taking the negated entity as its dative
argument. The use of this nominal is discussed in detail in §4.4,13.1. An example is:204Chapter 7(7-180) Guyalinyangawurniji manganymi-nka.lacking.II(NOM) 1 SG.NOMtucker.III-DATI've got no tucker.
In other examples, the negative particle guyala is used in its basic form and the negated NP
appears in the dative case. In this constuction guyala appears to function as an existential
negator:
ngi(7-181) Guyala gaguluna-nka, gagulinya
NEGyabu.y.brother.I-DAT y.sister.II(ACC) 1SG.A(PR) haveNo brothers, (but) I have a younger sister.
In a small number of examples guyala is used, but the negated NP is not in the dative case.
In this construction guyala appears to function as an argument negator. This construction
differs from that in which guyala is used to mark sentential negation as the negative particle is
not in initial position and there is no irrealis marking in the auxiliary. Furthermore, it seems
that guyala in these examples does not have the modal meaning that is associated with its use
as a sentential negator (see §7.6.1).

7.7 CLITICS AND PARTICLES
7.7.1 CLITICS
7.7.1.1 =MIJT `INFERential'
The clitic =mijî is used to mark epistemic mood and is encliticised to the first word of the
clause. Like the epistemic uses of the modals `must' and `might' in English, the use of =miji
indicates that the speaker has drawn an inference or conclusion as to the truth of the
proposition on the basis of available information.26 The most common usage of =miji in
Wambaya is as in examples (7-184) to (7-186), in which it denotes probability; the
information available to the speaker suggests that the proposition is likely to be true. In these
examples =mijî is translated by speakers into English as `must be'.

7.6.1.1 NEGATION OF INDICATIVE CLAUSES
There are two alternative constructions available for negating an indicative clause, each
containing a different negative particle (glossed NEG). Although speakers claim that the two
constructions have the same meaning, the distribution of each construction in the corpus
suggests that there is in fact a difference in usage between the two I will discuss this
difference below, but first I will explain and exemplify the structural characteristics of the
constructions.","[216, 217]"

5.3 DIRECTIONAL SUFFIXES
The Wambaya auxiliary can also contain directional suffixes (Table 5.4), which are used
to indicate whether the action takes place towards or away from a deictic centre, usually the
speaker. These suffixes also mark tense — past and non-past — and occur in place of the tense
suffixes discussed in §5.2.1 above. There are no examples in which the directional suffixes
co-occur with any of the aspect or mood markers.

AWAYNON-PAST-amany -ulama
-(g)any
-(g)ubaThese forms appear to contain the tense markers -a- `past tense', and -u- 'non-past tense'.
Note that these are common tense suffixes (see §5.2.1), although -u usually marks future
tense only. If the initial vowel marks tense, the remainder of the form must mark the152Chapter 5direction. However, since there is not a lot of similarity between the pairs of forms in this
respect I treat each form as if it were a portmanteau of tense and direction.""
In two examples in the corpus, the `direction away' forms have an initial velar stop when
they follow the first person object bound pronoun, -ng:

However, in most examples with the same object bound pronoun the velar stop is not

The two non-past forms have initial Iii/ when they follow one of the three subject bound
pronouns: ngirrî- IPL.EXC', girrî- `2PL' and irri- '3PL'. For example:

"Phonetics and phonology21(i) /rr/, /rl/ and /1/ behave as a class, being the only sounds that can precede /w/ in a
consonant cluster (the other lateral /ly/ does not occur in consonant clusters).
(ii) /rl/ and /rr/ are similar in that they both appear to condition lenition from /b/ to /w/ in the
verbal unmarked suffix -bî and the infinitive suffix -barda. See §6.1 for a discussion of
verbal inflection.
garran-bi
ngaj-bardastandBUT
see-INF BUTngîrr-wî
ngarl-wardagrowl
talk-INFNote that there are no verb roots that end with either of the other laterals: /1/ or Ay/.
However, these two arguments alone are not adequately convincing to support postulating
a natural class containing the laterals and Irr/. Thus, I assume that /rr/ is in a class of its own,
defined as a non-nasal, non-lateral sonorant.72.1.2 VOWELS
There is quite a wide range of allophonic variation among the three vowels in Wambaya.8
The major vowel allophones tend to be slightly central and become more so in unstressed
syllables. Vowels are fronted before palatal consonants and are often lowered or produced
with a more back articulation when next to the labio-velar approximant /w/. The various
allophones for each vowel phoneme and their environments are listed below:
/a/ has the allophone [œ] I [j, p]_[j] e.g. /jayili/ `down': rj ejtli]
[ai] /_[J, p, X, j] e.g. /danya/ `clothes': Cdaina]
[>al / [w]_[m] e.g. /wamba/ `snappy gum': ['w>amba]978/_[w]e.g. /barrawu/ `house': ['bar>awù][a] elsewheree.g. /baba/ `elder brother': ['baba]Gavan Breen (pers.comm.) claims that /rr/ is in fact closely related to Id/ (McGregor I988b also provides
evidence for a (historical) relationship between /d/ and /rr/ in other languages of northern Australia).
Breen points out that /rr/ and /d/ contrast only in Wambaya when they occur intervocalically after a
primary stressed vowel (and perhaps also as the initial member of a consonant cluster), but elsewhere
seem to be in complementary distribution. Thus, /d/ is found word-initially and as the second member of
a consonant cluster, while /rr/ occurs intervocalically after a non-primary stressed vowel. Although there
are a few exceptions to this distribution, most of them can be attributed to factors such as dissimilation
and morphological structure. However, as distributional evidence is not enough to he indicative of a
natural class (Juliette Blevins, pers.comm.), this does not affect my treatment of /rr/ discussed above.
The long vowels /aa/ and /ii/ are very unusual and are exemplified below and then discussed in more
detail in §2.1.4.
In the language name, the phonetic realisation of the first /a/ is closer to [a I than [>a l:
/wambaya/ 'Wambaya' ['womba'jal22Chapter 2Ii/ has the allophone [i] / _ [j], # e.g. /niyinama/ `female skin name': [ni jtnama]
e.g. /ngajbi/ `see': rr)aijbi]
[>i] I_ [w]e.g. /maliwa/ `big' (Iv): ['mal>iwa]
[t] elsewhere e.g. /ngijini/ `yesterday' : rtjttt.ni]10
/u/ has the allophone [u'] / [j, j, p, X] e.g./lujuluju/ 'coolamon': r'luiju'luiju]
e.g. /guyala/ `nothing': [1kuijala]
[û] / [w] _e.g. /mawula/ `play': r'm>awûla][u] elsewhereeg /jugu/ `MB' : rjugu]Vowels can also be slightly rhoticised before a retroflex consonant. This is especially true
of the low central vowel /a/.
In a small number of words a long vowel [a:] is found, and a couple of words have the
long vowel [i:]. Such long vowels always carry primary stress. There are no examples of
minimal pairs in which these long vowels contrast with the corresponding short vowels.
These vowels are written aa and iî respectively. Some examples are:

"7.7.2 PARTICLESThere are seven particles in the corpus: the negative particles guyala, yangula and alyu; the
negative interrogative wayi; the exclamative marker gubi and the conjunctions ngaha `THEN'
and gaji `LEST'.30 In addition there are three particles present in Hale's (1959) notes, but not
found in my corpus. These are the interrogative particle gayi and the conjunctions ngabayi
`admonitive' and marda `when'. The two interrogative particles and the three negative
particles were discussed above in §7.5 and §7.6 respectively. The other five particles are
discussed below_
7.7.2.1 GUB! 'EXCLAM'
There are only a few examples of this particle in the corpus and so it is difficult to
determine its exact meaning. However, in the small number of examples in which it is found.
29 See McConvell (1983) and McGregor (1990:459ff) for detailed discussions of the semantics of enclitics
30meaning 'only' and 'just' in other Australian languages.
The latter is found in the speech of only one consultant and so may not actually belong to Wambaya: see
§7.7.2.3 below.",[225]
"1SG.S-FUT goI'm not going.
However, despite seemingly equivalent examples such as these, there does appear to be a
semantic difference between the two particles. While yangula seems to be more of a general,
unmarked negation marker, the use of guyala implies that there are external factors, beyond
the actor's control, that prevent (or at least, make unlikely) the execution of the act described
by the proposition.221 Thus, guyala appears to be a negative modal22 indicating
`impossibility' or `unlikelihood', similar to English `can't'. Yangula, on the other hand,
denotes simple propositional negation and is therefore unmarked; it can be used either in
situations in which guyala would be inappropriate (i.e. there are no external forces which
prevent the action from being carried out) or in situations where the existence or absence of
such forces is simply not relevant.23 Some examples illustrating this semantic difference
follow.

In reflexive and reciprocal constructions, the reflexive/reciprocal bound pronoun (glossed
'RR') occurs in the object position in the auxiliary. The form of this bound pronoun is -ngg 4
and it is followed by regular tense/aspect/mood suffixes (see §5.2.1). Some examples are:

Sharp).
24 I am not completely sure about the order of these two choices; they may go the other way around.",[30]
"Phonetics and phonology25For a discussion of the stress placement rules in Wambaya see §2.2.4. '
2.2 PHONOTACTICS
All Wambaya words must contain a minimum of two syllables, can begin with either a
vowel or a consonant, and must end with a vowel (see below for a discussion of the auxiliary
which is the one exception to this). Although consonants (usually) cannot occur word-finally,
they can occur syllable-finally when they are the first element in a consonant cluster. There
are a few consonant-final nominal roots (involving /j/, /g/ and /ny/) and many of the verbal
stems are consonant-final, ending in either /n/, /rd/, Ir1/, Irr/, /j/, /ny/, /g/ or /ng/.
Biconsonantal clusters are common, but there are no vowel clusters.
The auxiliary can be both consonant-final and monosyllabic. Examples of monosyllabic
auxiliaries include:

mark both ergative and locative case functions (-ni), both Gudanji and Ngarnga have an alternative case
suffix that can also be used to mark locative case (-nbi). Ngarnga also has a separate instrumental case
suffix, -warndu, unlike the McArthur dialects, which use the ergative/locative case suffix in this function
