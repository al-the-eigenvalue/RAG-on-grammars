"3.9 Interrogatives (q)
3.9.1 Yes/no questions
Yes/no questions in Tayap are formed with the clitic =ke. The part of speech to
which =ke is cliticized is the focus of the question. So compare:
(3-88) a. Amanike okɨnet?
Amani =ke o
-kɨ
-net?
Amani =q go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s
‘Will Amani (as opposed to someone else) go?’
b. Amani okɨnetke?
Amani o
-kɨ
-net
=ke?
Amani go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s =q
‘Will Amani go?’ (as opposed to ‘will Amani stay?’)
Because it expresses uncertainty, =ke can also be used in a context where it would
be translated as ‘or’:
(3-89) a. epi ŋa Mbowdike Aperke yim okɨtike Potowre
epi
ŋa Mbowdi =ke Aper =ke yim
tomorrow 1sg Mbowdi =q Aper =q 1pl

‘tomorrow I’ll go with either Mbowdi or Aper to Wongan’
(lit. ‘tomorrow I Mbowdi? Aper? we two will go to Wongan’)

A third set of related deictic words are demonstrative identifiers, which indicate
particularity and presence, e.g. ‘it’s me’, or ‘I’m here’ (as opposed to being away
somewhere). The term “demonstrative identifiers” comes from Diessel (1999).
These words function in a similar way to how an adverb like ecco functions in the
Italian eccomi – ‘it’s me’ or ‘here I am’. So the most common response to a question like ‘Who are you?’ – asked, for example when one hears someone approaching in the pitch blackness of a moonless night – is Ŋa ainda (‘it’s me’).

sense that even though it would be grammatically correct to just say ŋɨ kut (‘he’s
here’), it is pragmatically awkward. One should say ŋɨ ainde kut (‘he dx.m is here’).
Finally, in addition to all the deictic forms listed above, Tayap also has a
quasi-deictic suffix -me, which means ‘yes, indeed, that one (or those) as opposed
to any other or others’, occurring on pronouns.
-me is also used to emphasize a referent, for example:
(3-87) a. ŋgɨme aŋgi ŋgwokara
ŋgɨ -me aŋgi ŋgwok
-ara
3pl -dx dx.pl go.3pl.r -perf

3sg.f -dx deed

‘Stop doing that!’
The suffix -me occurs just prior to the deictic aŋgi in one of the most frequently
heard phrases in Tayap: ŋguméŋgi. This phrase – a contracted form of ŋgu-me aŋgi
(3sg.f-me + aŋgi) – means ‘yes, that way’, ‘that’s right’ (“em nau” in Tok Pisin).","[114, 115, 116]"
"3.9.2 Information questions
Information questions are formed using one of the following interrogative words,
many of which are readily segmentable, e.g. anire ‘with whom’ can be segmented
as ani=re ‘who=com’; ani=yi is who=erg.f; ani=mat is who=poss, etc.:

Tayap speakers use a number of uninflected words to express emotional states,
affirmation or disagreement, as well as affective involvement with, or phatic
acknowledgement of, other people. These interjections form an utterance by
themselves:
ore‘Yes’. This is a Watam-language borrowing that has all but
replaced Tayap’s awo.awoThe Tayap word for the affirmative ‘Yes’. Since the 1980s,
however, it has become replaced by ore, and the meaning of
awo has shifted to express sarcastic agreement that would be
translated in English as ‘Yeah, right’ or ‘Like I’m so sure’.
The word has also taken on connotations of confrontation and
violence. It is shouted at others whom one is prepared to strike.
Parents use it frequently to threaten disobedient children, and
an adult engaged in a shouting match with another adult might
use it to signal that her or his patience is about to give in. When
it is shouted with sharp, rising volume and strong stress on the
final syllable awó, the word is a warning that means: ‘You haven’t
listened to my warnings and now I’m about to come and hit you!’wákare‘No’. This is also the morpheme of negation, often shortened to
wak when used to mean ‘No’ (as in: ‘Is there any food left?’ ‘No’).
When asked as a sharp question with rising intonation, wákare
signifies a threat, meaning: ‘So you’re not doing what I told you
to do? (I’m therefore going to come and hit you)’.ario‘He/she/it is coming to get you’. This word is used to scare
babies and small children. It is uttered preceded by the name of
the person or thing that the caregiver wants the child to think is
coming to get him or her, and is a vocative call, calling directly
to the person or thing to come and get the baby (in order to hit
the baby, or devour the baby).kapambínana ‘Exactly’, ‘Of course’Interjections and affect words99ŋguméŋgi‘That’s it’, ‘Exactly’yo‘Poor thing’. Always said in a soft voice with rising intonation,
with exaggeratedly extended vowel pronounced over the rise
(see also Section 2.1.2.1).ŋganokeya‘Poor thing’. Refers to someone who is not present because he or
she has died or left the village and gone away. Always said in a
soft voice with rising intonation. It frequently either precedes or
follows yo.aowoWord to convey longing and care for another, who is usually
absent. Always said in a soft voice with rising intonation.oiyo‘Poor me’. This is a kind of protest sound, usually growled in a
voice verging on tears. It is used frequently by children when
a caregiver insists they do something they don’t want to do, or
when another child won’t give the speaker something that she or
he claims is hers/his.ey‘Oh’, ‘That’s right’. Always said over two beats ‘e-y’ with rise-fall
intonation, often accompanied by raised eyebrows, which also
signifies agreement or affirmation.ai‘Hey!’wai‘Stop that!’tse‘You’ve got to be kidding!’akápore‘Oh my’, ‘How can this be?’akáiya‘Listen up’, ‘Hold on’, ‘Pay attention’yakáiya‘Oh my goodness!’. Said in response to a particularly salty joke,
clever riposte or outlandish threat. Said also if one sneezes
several times in a row – the sneezer says this him- or herself.numbwanrekɨ‘Watch out!’, ‘Be careful!’, ‘Think carefully!’ (lit. ‘with thought’)ayátaTwo different meanings:
(1) when shouted, it means: ‘Enough!’, ‘Stop it!’;
(2) when uttered in normal voice and said, for example, in
response to someone saying “Poor thing, I have no food to
give you”, it means: ‘Don’t worry about it’, ‘Don’t bother’.","[117, 118, 119]"
"Synonyms
Where no example or explanation is given between two cross-referenced words that
mean the same thing, I have been unable to elicit any difference in meaning. Examples
are ŋgakraw and ndadab, both of which mean ‘peel’, i.e. the skin of a fruit or vegetable that has been removed. My questions about difference in meaning were consistently answered with a version of the following: “If you want to say ŋgakraw, you’ll
say ŋgakraw. If you want to say ndadab you’ll say ndadab. They mean the same”
(“Yu laik tok ŋgakraw bai yu tok ŋgakraw. Na yu laik tok ndadab bai yu tok ndadab.
Em wankain mining tasol”). Or I would sometimes be told “wanpela mining na tok
i bruk”: there’s one meaning but the talk (i.e. the language) is broken, or fractured.",[362]

"3.1.3.3 Non-particular nouns
Nouns that otherwise could be expected to be masculine can be feminine under
two circumstances.
The first is when the subject or referent of a verb is a general class of people
rather than a named or known individual. For example, the following utterance
is from a harangue by an older Tayap speaker who is chastising younger villagers for behaving badly. In the course of his harangue, the speaker wonders
rhetorically which big man (i.e. which old, knowledgeable man) is still alive to
teach young people about the good ways of the past. (The answer, he knows,
is ‘none’.)
His question was phrased as follows:
(3-22) Ani munje suman wuk?
who man
big
be.3sg.f.r
‘Which big man is here (i.e. still living)?’
Note that the verb ‘be’ is inflected in 3sg.f, even though the referent is unambiguously a male. The use of the feminine form here conveys generality. It refers to
the category or class of ‘big men’ rather than to a specific big man. If the speaker
had phrased the question using the 3sg.m form of ‘be’, kut, the question would
be referring to a specific named or known big man: ‘Which one of the big men we
all know is present here right now?’
Another example of the same phenomenon is the following (feminine forms
that denote the male referent are in bold):Nouns61(3-23) ŋgu munje ŋgo ŋgon pawrɨk tatukundre, nirkwanuk, noni namkru wákare

‘The man is of course finding his strength and doing it on his own,
nobody else is telling him to’
This utterance was spoken during a tense discussion about the incessant and disruptive drinking in the village that, by late 2009, had been plaguing Gapun for
some time. During a village-wide meeting, the mother of a fifteen-year-old boy
shouted angrily that her husband never tried to stop their son from drinking.
In response, a man in his late thirties made the comment above, which is
dismissive of the mother and supports the young man’s father by implying that
it wouldn’t matter what the father told his son. The son, this man is saying, is old
enough and would act according to his own desires anyway: no one is ordering
him to drink; he does it because he wants to. But as in the previous example,
(3-22), this utterance refers to a male using feminine grammatical forms.
The rhetorical effect is the same: the speaker’s use of feminine grammatical
forms when talking about a male conveys a meaning of generality. The speaker
is not overtly disputing anything the mother says about her son or her husband,
these grammatical forms say; he is making a general observation.
A non-literal but semantically more accurate translation of the man’s remark
would be: ‘As young men get older and stronger of course they decide on their own
what they want to do, they don’t do things just because other people tell them to’.
3.1.3.4 Gender in young people’s Tayap
Young speakers are aware that Tayap marks gender, and they know how to mark
it on verb stems, object suffixes, subject suffixes and through ergative markers.
A problem they have, though, is keeping straight the forms that mark masculine gender from the ones that mark feminine gender. This problem can be exemplified by a short extract from a narrative told by an eighteen-year-old woman.
This young woman is telling a story about a crocodile that she and some other
young women caught in the mangrove swamp. The women tied the 1.5 meter-long
crocodile’s jaws together, put it in a copra bag and brought it home. It lived for a
while, then, the speaker recounts, her father killed it (forms that express gender
are in bold):623 Word classes(3-24) orem aŋgi wuk embre sasŋi poŋgɨn

po
-ŋgɨ
-n
strike.r -3sg.m.r.o
-sg|1pl.s
‘the (female) crocodile was there, in the morning (male) father killed him’
All the words and morphemes that express gender are correctly formed. The masculine ergative case morpheme on ‘father’ is also the correct one. But note that
the grammatical gender of the crocodile here changes from feminine to masculine
in the course of a single utterance. Crocodiles are generally masculine in Tayap,
so the final verb here, poŋgɨn, is exactly what a fluent speaker would say. But the
deictic word used by this young speaker, aŋgi, as well as the first verb, wuk, are
semantically incorrect – they are the feminine forms, but what the speaker wants
are the masculine forms: ainde kut.
If the speaker had been talking about a female crocodile (for example if the
crocodile had been found to be carrying eggs), then the deictic aŋgi and the verb
wuk would have been correct. But in that case, the final verb should have had a feminine object morpheme – it should have been po-ku-n (kill.r-3sg.f.r.o-sg|1pl.s).
This kind of gender-mixing is characteristic of young speakers. Generally
speaking, the younger and less competent the speaker, the more gender will be
mixed in haphazard ways like this. As in many other areas of Tayap grammar, it
is clear that young speakers know that a particular distinction is expressed in the
vernacular. They are also capable of producing some of the forms that mark the
distinction. What they lack is the capacity to realize the distinction in a grammatically consistent manner.
In Young People’s Dyirbal, a situation of language death in Australia, weaker
speakers changed the semantic gender assignment system to a simple animacy/
gender system. That is, they kept the morphology and rearranged the class assignment system (Schmidt 1985). That is the opposite situation to what is happening
with Tayap: here, the assignment principles remain but what is changed is that
the morphological marking has become inconsistent.","[80, 81, 82]"
"The unmarked generic form of this question word is the feminine ani=yi (see
Section 3.9 on interrogatives, and Section 3.1.3.3 on the generic feminine).",[132]
"Cosubordinate constructions277in serial verb constructions formed with a non-final verb + a final verb like those
discussed in Section 8.2:

ŋa =yi
awin worer
-ku
1sg =erg water capsize.irr -3sg.f.r.o
‘I poured the water’wok
go.3sg.f.rNotice how the first sentences in these pairs (9-38a) and (9-39a) only has one argument – the subject, ‘canoe’ in (9-38a) and ‘water’ in (9-39a). The second sentences
have two arguments – subject (‘they’ and ‘I’) and object (‘canoe’ and ‘water’).
Negation on verbs marked with -ra is only marked on the independent verb
that carries TAM, but its scope is both/all verb stems. So the negation of a verb
like ‘jump’ is:
(9-40) ŋɨ
pɨŋ
-ra
atɨ
-kɨ
wákare
3sg.m jump.r -mod go_down.irr -irr neg
‘he didn’t jump down’ or ‘he won’t jump down’9.8.2 Cosubordinate constructions with manner suffix -kar (mann)
Like clause chains constructed with -ra, those formed with -kar also add a morpheme directly onto the irrealis stem of a verb that precedes a verb of motion, thus
creating a medial verb. Unlike the -ra forms, however, constructions formed with
-kar or its allophonic variant -kwar (the environment triggering the alternation2789 Simple and complex sentencesis unknown) maintain the separate meanings of the modified verb and the verb
of motion that follows it. The suffix -kar creates a manner medial verb, one that
answers the question ‘How or in what manner did X go/come, etc.?’
Verbs constructed with -kar are constructed in the following way:
irr verb stem + -kar/-kwar + fully inflected verb of motion
Verbs formed with -kar encode the simultaneity of both actions for the duration
of both actions. In English, this temporal relationship would be rendered with the
adverbial ‘as’, as in ‘They were laughing as they washed the dishes’, or participle
clauses, as in ‘Laughing, they washed the dishes’. In other words, the first action,
laughing, occurred simultaneously with, and continued for the same length of
time as, the second action, washing the dishes.
This foregrounding of duration and simultaneity results in awkward literal
translations, as in the following example:
(9-41) nda mbɨd non
rekɨ ai
-kar
wek
dm pain indef with come.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
‘she came feeling pain as she came’
A more idiomatic translation would be with an English adverbial phrase; something that highlighted the experience of pain as during travel, like ‘In pain, she
made her way here’.
Cosubordinate constructions created with the -kar suffix also highlight an
action or process that has begun and is continuing, especially when the construction is used with an inanimate subject. In English, this kind of phrase
would use a verb of inception, like ‘begin’ or ‘start’, or a verb of intensification or process, like ‘growing’ or ‘becoming’; for example: ‘his anger was
growing’.
The verb of motion that follows the medial verb created with the -kar suffix is
most commonly either ‘go’ (okɨ) or ‘come’ (aiki), although any verb of motion may
occur in this slot. Examples are:
(9-42) a. ŋgu
warak
-kar
wek
3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
‘she came talking’
b. ŋɨ
ŋgar
-kwar mbot
3sg.m call_out.irr -mann go.sg.m.r
‘he called out as he went along’Cosubordinate constructions279The sense of development and process means that these verb forms can co-occur
with other chained forms, such as the -ra forms, for example:
(9-43) minjike =ŋa
mbatep pwak
-ra
o
-kar
wek
betel_nut =poss unit
drop.irr -mod go.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
‘the flowers on the betel nut (palm) are in the process of opening’
This suggests that the -ra clause and the -kar clause are syntactically equivalent,
both equally dependent on the final verb wek ‘come’.
The directionality of the verb of motion (‘go’ or ‘come’) can express a difference in meaning, as in the following:
(9-44) a. toto andɨ
-kar
wek
skin swell.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (in various places because bees have stung me)
b.toto andɨ
-kar
wok
skin swell.irr -mann go.3sg.f.r
‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (from a central point and spreading outwards)This kind of semantic difference encoded by different verbs of motion may have
been more productive in the past, and subtle nuances may have been eroded and
lost over the course of the last few decades. Today, senior speakers insist that with
only a few exceptions, such as (9-44a) and (9-44b) above, verbs formed with ‘go’
and ‘come’ have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably.
Chains with -kar are negated by placing the negative marker after the independent verb. So the negated form of example (9-42a) is:
(9-45) ŋgu
warak
-kar
ai
-ki
wákare
3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.irr -irr neg
‘she was not talking as she came’
The scope of negation in manner constructions has to include the medial verb.
Thus, the negated sentence means that the woman probably still came (the sentence probably would not have been uttered if she hadn’t come); she just didn’t
come talking.
This seems to indicate that -kar (and in fact -ra) are complex verbal constructions rather than adverbials, since negation of adverbials would be
expressed with the negator directly after the adverbial, not as here at the end
of the clause.","[296, 297, 298, 299]"
"Serial verb constructions (svc)231is permeable, and can be interrupted by question morphemes and even separate
words, as in the following:
(8-3) kopi tarak masinnɨ ŋgakrawokwankuk
kopi
tar
-ak
masin=nɨ
coffee (TP) take.irr -3sg.f.nfo machine (TP)=loc
ŋgakrawo -kwan
kuk
shell.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o be.sg.f|1pl.r
‘we used to take the coffee to a machine and shell it’
In this situation the form is no longer a single phonological word but still a single
predicate.
Serial verb constructions are composed of one or more non-final verb(s) and
a final verb. The non-final verbs are always formally irrealis, but the final verb can
take the full range of Tayap’s TAM inflections. TAM and subject marking occurs
once across the construction, on the final verb, and the non-final verb(s) are
marked only for their object, if transitive.
According to Haspelmath (2016: 296), a serial verb construction is “a monoclausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element
linking them and with no predicate-argument relation between the verbs”. It is
important to make clear that non-final and final verbs are both independent, and
there is not a relationship of syntactic dependency between the verbs of a serial
verb construction. Instead, there is a sharing of features (TAM, subject marking
and negation). The differences between non-final and final verbs are positional, a
factor of where they fall in the clause, rather than related to dependency.","[250, 251]"

Tayap examples in the grammar usually consist of four lines. The first is the Tayap
speech written in bounded, unsegmented words.
The second line is the same clause or sentence in which the words have been
separated into morphemes.
The third line is the interlinear gloss of the morphemes. The space separating
the morphemes in the second and third lines is larger than it is in most grammars
for reasons of readability. The usual manner of presentation, in which glosses for
morphemes are chained together in long, complicated strings, assumes readers
with a great deal of specialized knowledge, experience and patience. Separating the morphemes should make the glosses easier to process. The spacing does
admittedly make it a bit harder to see individual words, but those appear in the
first line of the examples.
The fourth line is the translation into English.
An example is as follows:
(1) Merewŋgrogi munje parŋgɨro
Merew -ŋgro =gi
munje par
-ŋgɨ
-ro
Sanae
-pl
=erg.pl man
bury.r -3sg.m.r.o -3pl.r.s
‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’
Suffixes are marked by hyphens (-) and clitics are marked with an equal sign (=).
In Tayap there are no prefixes, only suffixes, and enclitics rather than proclitics.
Some glossing conventions used throughout this grammar in the interlinear
glosses need to be noted. Tayap verbs – and other words – have a broad range of
meanings, and an o, for example, is consistently glossed as ‘strike’ in the interlinear glosses, but is translated to its context-specific meaning as ‘hit’, ‘stab’, ‘kill’,
etc. in the translation. Similarly, the Locative case has a broad range of meanings.
It is glossed as loc when it has a locational meaning but in other contexts it may
be glossed as temp for temporal, com for comitative or all for allative.
Further conventions need explanation are as follows:
The first is the pipeline symbol | which appears in example 3 below underneath the final morpheme -n. This symbol means that the morpheme it glosses
has more than one meaning. Disambiguation occurs through the use of pronouns
or nouns, or through context.
An S is used in glossing transitive verbs to show features of the subject. With
intransitive verbs, the person/number/status of subjects are marked in the language but there is no S in the gloss.
https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-202Conventions and abbreviationsXIXAnother convention concerns Tayap’s discontinuous subject markers. Some
verbs have subject morphemes that occur both before and after the object morpheme. An example is as follows:
(2) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
ŋgu
=yi
aram ta
-tɨ
-ŋgɨ
3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -r.s -3sg.m.r.o
‘she saw a snake’-n
-r.sIn this verb, the combination of -tɨ before the object morpheme and -n after the
object morpheme encodes either a 2sg or 3sg.f subject in realis status. The
pronoun ‘she’ disambiguates the subject to be 3sg.f, in this case. Since it is the
combination of the two discontinuous subject morphemes that produces meaning,
the labeling convention adopted here is to gloss the first subject morpheme
with ‘s’ (‘subject’), and to gloss the combined meaning of the two morphemes
under the second morpheme. The object morpheme in verbs like this case occurs
between the two subject markers, and is bounded by < > instead of hyphens, to
show that it intervenes between the two discontinuous subject markers.
So in this grammar, the example above is written as:
(3) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
ŋgu
=yi
aram ta
-tɨ
3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -s‘she saw a snake’-ŋgɨ
-n
<3sg.m.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.sThe abbreviations used in the interlinear glosses otherwise generally follow the
Leipzig glossing rules.
Note that the dictionary uses some different terms and abbreviations (see
page 351 for those).","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun5This means that four percent of the world’s population speaks the overwhelming majority of the world’s languages. And those languages – thousands of
them, many of them undocumented – are believed to be in danger of vanishing
within the next one hundred years.
Tayap is one of those languages. And in the literature on language death that
began burgeoning in the 1990s, it has sometimes been featured as a poignant
example. It is discussed, for example, in Daniel Nettle and Suzanne Romaine’s
comprehensive overview of language extinction around the world. Those linguists cite my earlier work on Gapun (employing the spelling of “Tayap” that I
used previously; Kulick 1992) to make the point that:
Taiap is an amazingly rich language in terms of its structural diversity and particularly
distinctive vocabulary, unlike any other in the Sepik. It is not clearly related to any other
language in the area or indeed to any other language in Papua New Guinea as far as we can
tell. (2000:13)This celebration of Tayap’s uniqueness and complexity is a buildup that leads
to a somber punchline: “While further research might provide clues about the
precise genetic relationship between Taiap and other languages, this is unlikely
to happen. Taiap is dying”, write Nettle and Romaine, employing a baleful tone
that is characteristic of work on language death around the world.
No one could dispute that the disappearance of a human language is a cause
for lamentation and mourning. And it would be insensitive and beside the point
to critique linguists’ attempts to inform a wider public about the widespread language extinction that appears to be occurring across the globe today. But even
as we acknowledge and appreciate this, it is still possible to be skeptical of what
has emerged as a dominant way in which linguists discuss language death –
the likening of endangered languages to endangered animals and endangered
plants.
Nettle and Romaine, for example, liken Tayap to a great bird. They write, “if
Taiap were a rare species of bird or Ubykh [another endangered language they
discuss] a dying coral reef, maybe more people would know of their plight and
be concerned”. And they continue, asking dramatically, “Should we be any less
concerned about Taiap than we are about the passing of the California condor?”
(2000: 13–14).
A question like that is difficult to answer, not least because it is far from
obvious what “our” concern that Tayap is dying might actually materialize in practice, and what consequences those material expressions of “our” concern might
have for anyone living in Gapun. There is also a problem with likening Tayap to a
condor because exquisite as languages may be, they really are not like condors or61 The Tayap language and its speakerscoral reefs. Condor chicks are not sent to schools where they are taught in a cosmopolitan language they’ve barely ever heard, and where they learn to devalue
their traditional condor ways. Coral reefs are not converted to Christianity and
told that their traditional reef ways are Satanic.
To be fair, none of these things happen to languages either. But they do
happen to speakers of many of the languages that linguists are so concerned
about. Linguists like Nettle and Romaine who use species metaphors understand this, of course. But in the current cultural climate that exhorts people
to develop concern for the environment and sustainability, many linguists
seem to believe that they can elicit some kind of sympathy and support for
dying languages if they talk about them in terms of biodiversity and species
loss.
This way of thinking about language death is specious, however, because
it directs our attention to the natural world. By encouraging us to think in
terms of ecosystems rather than political systems, ecological or species metaphors elide, or at least defer, the simple realization that language death is
anything but a natural phenomenon. On the contrary, it is a profoundly social
phenomenon.
Languages die because people stop speaking them, not because they exhaust
themselves in the fullness of time or are killed off by predatory languages of
greater phonological scope or syntactic richness.
A better metaphor for language death, instead of seeing languages as
animals or organisms, would be to think of them like political movements,
philosophies or religions – that is, to consider them as social phenomena that
cannot be comprehended apart from history, beliefs, economics, desire, structure and power. And that necessarily change and sometimes even disappear as
the material, economic, social and cultural conditions that sustain them shift
and transform.
With that in mind, and given the current state and tenor of Gapun village life,
I wish to make it clear that this grammar and dictionary of Tayap is not an effort to
influence the future. It is, instead, a record that documents what I am convinced
soon will be the irrevocable past. Gapun villagers are ceasing to speak their language and if present trends persist, in thirty or forty years, Tayap will be gone
forever. While this is inconsolably sad, it is the villagers’ choice. It is a choice I
have no doubt that their descendants will castigate them for, as always eventually
happens with languages that die.
But I do not write this grammar and dictionary with the fantasy that its
appearance will somehow change villagers’ lives and make them revive their
dying language. Indeed, I recognize that the opposite may – and at this point
probably will – happen. The appearance of Tayap words printed in a book mayGeneral overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun7foster resignation and complacency: a sense that, “Well now our language is all
there in a book, so we don’t really have to worry about it anymore, our children
can learn it from the book when they’re grown up”. Tayap in a book may also
solidify a view that the language is an august tongue of the ancestors far too
majestic and esoteric for young people to ever even attempt to master.
So why write a book about Tayap? Partly to preserve some small part of the
proverbial treasure chest of human knowledge, certainly. But mostly, I have
written this grammar and dictionary primarily in the hope that a curious young
Gapuner, sometime in the probably distant future, will discover it somewhere and
value the fact that the obsolete language of his or her ancestors did not disappear
without a trace.
The dictionary that accompanies this grammar is trilingual: Tayap, English
and Tok Pisin. A few of the villagers in Gapun have had as many as ten years of
schooling, most of it in English. Despite that, though (or, really, because of that),
none of them currently possesses anything but the most rudimentary command of
that language.1 No villager today will be able to make much sense of this grammar
of Tayap, but the dictionary part of this work may be entertaining and useful to
them now, as opposed to some distant future. And to facilitate that usefulness, I
have included definitions in the language that is replacing Tayap and in which all
villagers are fluent: Tok Pisin.
I have also provided many examples of how the words in the dictionary
are used in Tayap, and I have purposely included a large number of vulgarities.
Gapun villagers are no different from anyone else who has ever scoured a dictionary to see if it dared to list the most obscene terms that one and one’s sniggering
friends could dream up. I hope that the shock of seeing some of their most vulgar
words and insults immortalized in a book will provide the villagers with a great
deal of guilty pleasure.
This grammar and dictionary should be of interest to linguists who study
Sepik and Ramu languages and the genealogical relationships of Papuan languages more generally. It should also interest archeologists and historians who
study the peopling and linguistic diversity of the Sepik region of Papua New
Guinea.","[24, 25, 26, 27]"
"Tayap has a six-way distinction for singular referents – three for feminine referents and three for masculine referents. As in other parts of Tayap grammar,
the gender distinction collapses in the plural, and here the language maintains a
two-way distinction:

further from speakeraŋge(de)
aŋgɨ(de)‘these’, ‘here’
‘those’, ‘there’Note that the three-way distance distinction in the singular and two-way in the
plural is highly unusual and may in fact be a simplification: the middle term in
the singular could in fact be a close-to-addressee term or expressing other pragmatic factors (see e.g. Wilkins 1999).5
In addition to the words listed above, Tayap also has a number of slightly
different deictic words. They are as follows:
FeminineMasculinePluralaŋgok…aŋgo
‘this... here’
aŋgudek…aŋgu
‘that…there’aindet….ende ‘this …here’
anɨndet…ende/inde/ide/de
‘that…there’
6aŋgeb…aŋge
‘these…there’
aŋgɨb… aŋgɨb ‘those…
there’The first or second words in these pairs can occur alone functioning as an argument of a verb phrase. During a disagreement between two men, for example, one
protagonist responded to the other’s threats to come and beat him up with the
dismissive snort addressed to everybody who was listening:6
(3-84) aindetŋike oyin?
aindet
=ŋi
=ke o
-yi
-n?
that_one =erg.m =q strike.irr -1sg.irr.o -sg|1pl.irr.s
‘that one there is going to hit me?’
These topicalizing deictic words often co-occur, sometimes multiple times in an
utterance.7 They can be post-posed to a noun to emphasize it, for example in
response to a question like ‘Who did it?’:5 We thank Anna Margetts for this observation.
6 The second word here, ende, can also be realized as inde, ide or de
7 It is possible that these instances might more felicitously be labeled “focusing”, “highlighting” or “emphasizing” rather than topicalizing (Reesink 2014). More information and analysis
on the functions of all these deicitics is needed.","[113, 114]"
"1746 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsSo a class 2 verb like war ‘fill’ will be inflected as
(6-15) a. *war
-ku
fill.irr -3sg.f.r.o
‘I filled it’-n
-sg|1pl.r.sinstead of the correct form, which is:
b.par -ku
fill.r -3sg.f.r.o
‘I filled it’-n
-sg|1pl.r.sAn incorrect form like *warkun indicates that the speaker is using the verb root,
war, as the basis for inflection. All young people do this, and this kind of error
demonstrates a central feature of how young speakers produce Tayap verb morphology: they clearly perceive the morphological structure of verbs but they are
unable to produce them correctly.
The speaker who produced *warkun possibly had a sense that the verb she
wanted is associated with both the semivowel w and the plosive p. Having heard
parkun (‘I filled it’), warkrutak (‘she will fill it’, or ‘you (f) will fill it’) and warkru
wákare (‘X won’t fill it) all her life, the speaker who produced this utterance
probably intuitively knew the different forms that this verb can take. She has not
analyzed the different sounds as signifying different tenses and statuses, and so
what she ends up producing is a verb that mixes together realis and irrealis forms
and results in an ungrammatical neologism.
Young speakers who attempt to inflect class 1 or 2 verbs that they do not automatically know do one of three things:
The first thing they can do is illustrated by the above example: they include
both the irrealis and realis forms in the same verb. Other examples are *wurpukun
(instead of puwkun; from wuw ‘carry on shoulder’) and *woipokun (instead of
poikun; from woi ‘roll’).
The second strategy is to conjugate the class 1 or 2 verb as though it were a
class 5 verb. This means treating the verb root as though it is invariant, and also
using a discontinuous subject marker in the non-future. So a class 1 verb like
kotar-(p)-e ‘ask’ becomes *kotar and is inflected as:
(6-16) a. *kotar -tu -ku
-n
ask.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘she asked her’Transitive verb classes175instead of the correct form:
b. kotarpe -ku

-sg|1pl.r.sThe ungrammatical verb *kotar-tu-ku-n is a perfectly correctly formed class 5 verb
(see below, Section 6.1.7). The problem is that the verb in question, kotar-(p)-e-, is
a class 1 verb, not a class 5 verb.
At the same time, however, it is important to note that anyone hearing the
ungrammatical verb *kotar-tu-ku-n will have no trouble understanding its
meaning. The verb root kotar means ‘query’. It derives the noun ‘question’ (as
kotarŋgar) and the intransitive verb ‘ask’, kotarkɨ. Because this basic meaning of
the verb root is known to everyone, it does not make a great deal of difference for
comprehension if the verb is conjugated as a class 1 verb or as a class 5 verb.
This kind of separable relationship between the meaning of a verb root and the
details of its inflection will likely lead to the attrition of class 1 and 2 verbs. When
it doesn’t matter is if a verb is inflected as mbuspiŋgɨn (class 1, mbus-(p)-i ‘send’)
or mbustiŋgɨn (‘send’ inflected as a class 5 verb), the less regular inflection will
inexorably decline in use in the speech of young speakers who have not learned it.
At the same time as young speakers simplify Tayap verbal morphology in this
way – that is, treating verbs of other classes as though they were all class 5 verbs –
there is also a competing tendency to insert a p in verbs that do not take one. So
some young speakers produce forms like the following:
(6-17) a. *moserpi -ku

‘I followed her’
verb root andu- (class 3)
Both (6-17a and 6-18a) are inflected as class 1 verbs in the non-future tense,
despite the fact that moser ‘buy’ is a class 4 verb and andu ‘follow’ is a class 3
verb. These cases exhibit the opposite of the tendency just discussed: instead of
collapsing class 1 and 2 verbs into class 5 verbs, verbs from other classes become
incorporated into class 1 and 2 verbs.
There may have always been some free variation in Tayap on this count. In
the speech of the oldest Tayap speakers, for example, I recorded two words for
the verb ‘sweep’; one mburai (class 5) and the other mburai-(p)-i (class 1). The
difference in non-future inflection between these two verbs is the element that
directly follows the stem: in the first verb that is n or t plus a vowel, in the second
verb it is a p.
So using the first verb, one would say that a woman mburaitukun her house;
using the second, one would say she mburaipikun.
When I asked if these two forms meant anything different the oldest speakers in
the village told me no, they were exact synonyms. And that they were both correct.
The co-existence of two different forms of the same verb suggests that there may
have always been some accepted variation in the classification of verbs as class 5 or
class 1 verbs. If this is the case, then it seems that some young speakers have honed
in on that variation and exploited it. They inflect verbs as class 1 verbs (i.e. inserting
a p in the non-future) much less frequently than they simply collapse all verbs into
class 5 verbs. But the fact that they can create class 1 verbs out of verb roots from
other classes shows, once again, that young speakers possess a broad repertoire of
grammatical competence in Tayap. What they lack is productive ability.
The third strategy that young speakers use when they are unsure of how to
conjugate a class 1 or 2 verb in the non-future is to inflect it in the progressive
aspect. This often makes little semantic sense. But as is discussed in Section
8.3.1, the progressive aspect is an “easy” inflectional form – all one needs to know
is three things: (1) the irrealis stem form of the verb; (2) the benefactive object
(which in most cases will be -kwan ‘3sg.f.ben.r.o’); and (3) the correct form of the
verb ‘be’. This relative morphological transparency appeals to younger speakers
and allows them to use verbs they otherwise would have a hard time inflecting.
Thus, rather than tackling the class 2 verb war ‘grate’, to generate the correct
non-future form parkun ‘I grated it’, or the class 1 verb o ‘shoot’, to generate the
correct non-future form pokun ‘I shot it’, young speakers telling stories about
their actions and adventures say things like the following:Transitive verb classes177(6-19) a. war
-kwan

‘I (f) was grating it’
b. o
-kwan
-kut
strike.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o - be.sg.m.r.s
‘I (m) was shooting it’
These are perfectly formed progressives. However, the context in which they
occurred demanded the non-future tense. But by inflecting the verbs in the progressive aspect, the speakers who needed them were at least able to use them.
This phenomenon illustrates a general rule of grammatical decay in Tayap,
namely: the weaker the speaker, the more instances of the progressive aspect that
speaker will use (see also Section 8.3.1).","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197]"
"2.3 Syllable structure and phonotactics
2.3.1 Syllable structure
Syllable structure is (C1)V(C2) or C3C4V(C2) or (C1)VC5C6.
C1 is any consonant
C2 is any consonant but y
C3 is any stop
C4 is r
C5 is w
C6 is any stop
V is a single vowel
Although words can be generated from this schema with multiple V syllables, in
practice sequences of more than two vowels do not occur (see above, Section 2.2).
So under this schema a word like aruat ‘thunder’ would be two syllables:
V.CVC.
The position C5 is analyzed as a semivowel /w/ rather than a vowel /u/ for one
reason. C6 is only ever a stop: thus an analysis of C5 as /u/ would mean that CVC
sequences with /u/ as the vowel could only ever be followed by stops. This would
be a rather strange situation, so it is avoided here by instead positing a CC cluster
with /w/ as the first consonant and any stop as the second.

theory be distinguished from those of the shape VmCV, where mC is a prenasalized
stop, on the grounds that prenasalization fluctuates word-medially in Tayap, and
thus could be not pronounced, whereas if the segment in question is a nasal consonant it must be pronounced.
They can also be distinguished in other ways. So for example nam'bar ‘one’ has
stress on the syllable beginning /b/, not on the /mb/ cluster, indicating that the nasal
is a full nasal consonant rather than prenasalization belonging to the voiced stop.
This analysis has implications for the orthography, and here the decision is
a pragmatic one: while it is possible to distinguish NC from mC medially, in the
orthography these are not distinguished. Thus, a voiced stop with no accompanying nasal indicates a voiced stop, which could alternatively be pronounced with
or without nasalization. But a nasal and homorganic voiced stop cluster may refer
to a NC cluster, e.g. as in nambar, or it may refer to a prenasalized stop mC.","[54, 55]"

The lexical class of verbs is an open class which can be characterized as being
able to host realis/irrealis status and transitivity suffixes as well as subject and
object suffixes. A fully inflected verb can function as the sole word of a sentence.
There are two major subclasses of verbs: intransitive and transitive. Examples
of each are:
Intransitive verb
(3-28) ŋgu pirok

1sg=erg.f 2sg see.r -s <2sg.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
‘I saw you’
There are no ditransitive verbs in Tayap (see also Section 9.1). Semantically threeplace predicates express the recipient of giving, for example, with the benefactive
morpheme:
(3-30) is
-iata
-n
give.sbj -1sg.ben.r.o -sg|1pl.r
‘(you) give it to me!’
However the recipient can be omitted, indicating that the verb in question is transitive, not ditransitive, and that the benefactive morpheme is an optional oblique
argument:
(3-31) epi
i
-kru
-net
tomorrow give.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s
‘I (m) will give it (to someone) tomorrow’
Benefactive objects and regular objects cannot coocur in the same clause.
As well as being divided into transitivity classes, every Tayap verb falls
into one of nine conjugation classes, based on how verbs form their non-future
forms: there are five classes for transitive verbs and four for intransitives (see
Chapter 6).
Verb morphology in Tayap is entirely suffixing, with morphemes for object
and subject added – in that order, apart from discontinuous subject markers – to
verb stems. A characteristic feature of Tayap verbs is that status is marked across
the verb multiple times. The stem must occur in either an irrealis or realis form.
In addition, the object and subject morphemes that get suffixed to the stem also
encode realis/irrealis status.
This can be illustrated with an example from the transitive verb stem o, which
means ‘strike’ (and covers actions like ‘shoot’, ‘stab’ and ‘hit’). Note how irrealis
vs. realis is marked across the verb (in bold):Verbs65(3-32) a. pokun

The same thing happens with intransitive verbs, exemplified here with the verb
memkɨ ‘get up’:
(3-33) a. pemiet

-iet

Status2marking on verbs, while mandatory, does not always occur in predictable
ways. Realis morphemes can occur as part of a verb that refers to an unreal event.
An example is the counterfactual mood (cf), which is a prototypical irrealis category, because it refers to events that never occurred, such as ‘If he had seen it, he
would have shot it’. However in Tayap, on transitive verbs, the counterfactual is2 Note that the negative verb requires irrealis marking, see Section 5.4.2.1.","[82, 83, 84, 85]"

in Gapun were ready to fight men from the neighboring village of Sanae. All prepared to fight, the Gapun men could ask one another in anticipatory excitement:

‘it wouldn’t be good if it’s Kem’s things [i.e. his connections with the

above).22 This example is marked by non-agreement between the plural noun (orasamb, ‘things’) and
the plural ergative morpheme (=gi) affixed to the noun, and the singular inflection (-ŋgarana) on
the verb ‘make’ (nir). One would expect the plural ending –ŋgroana ( so ‘nirŋgroana’ see Section
7.3).
It is probable that this example takes the form it does because the plural noun orak samb
(‘things’) is usually treated as a singular entity. So speakers say:

knowing the form it takes when it is negated. With that in mind, notice once again

The final class of transitive verbs, class 5, is the simplest verb class. In class 5
verbs, the stem remains the same and does not change between the irrealis and
realis statuses. This regularity and simplicity is certainly one reason why all
foreign verbs that get incorporated into Tayap become inflected as class 5 verbs.1
It is also why speakers younger than thirty tend to conjugate all transitive verbs
as though they belonged to this verb class.","[183, 184, 185, 186]"
"5.4.2.3 Near future (nrfut)
The near future is formed by suffixing morpheme -ana (-nana after a vowel) to a
verb inflected for future tense:

The suffix -(n)ana expresses intention (see Section 7.4). But Tayap distinguishes between a near future tense and an intentional mood. Pure intentionality, with no morphological marking for time, is signaled on both transitive
and intransitive verbs by omitting the subject suffixes in the inflected future
verb and affixing -(n)ana directly to the irrealis object marker (for transitive
verbs) and directly to the irrealis modal marker (for intransitive verbs). So

The only difference between these two questions is that in the first example
(5-12a) there is no subject suffix on the verb.
In practice, it can be difficult or meaningless to try to distinguish between the
near future and intention. Just as an English expression like ‘I’m going to leave now’
conflates the desire or intention to leave with an action that is about to occur, so
does a Tayap sentence inflected in the near future tense imply a desire or intention.
However, the difference between English and Tayap here is that unlike
English, Tayap can also clearly morphologically distinguish between an action
that is intended or desired and one that is about to occur.","[173, 174]"
"181 The Tayap language and its speakersGiven that it was clear that Tayap was still used throughout Gapun, for a long
time I thought that perhaps the young people really were quite competent in the
vernacular, as they claimed to be. I fretted that I just never seemed to be in the
right place at the right time to hear them when they actually spoke it.
I began to wonder whether the reason I wasn’t hearing young people telling
each other stories or asking each other questions in Tayap was because maybe
they spoke it mostly out of the earshot of older, more fluent speakers. Maybe they
felt ashamed that they weren’t speaking it completely flawlessly, I conjectured.
Or perhaps the vernacular, for them, had become tied to particular social events
like same-sex gossip or hanging out in the rainforest – speech situations that
only happened when young people were alone in groups and away from nosy and
critical parents and elders.
To see whether any of this was in fact the case, I ended up spending a
great deal of time with young people of both sexes between the ages of fourteen to twenty-five. I accompanied young men into the rainforest on frequent
occasions, to go looking for birds to shoot with arrows or slingshots, and also
when they went off together in groups to perform secret rituals that refresh
their bodies.
I also spent a lot of time hanging out with young women. One place I made
a point of doing this was inside maternity huts. Maternity huts are small, flimsy,
hurriedly-constructed little houses on stilts, set on the periphery of the village,
often near areas that villagers go off into to urinate or defecate. Women ready to
give birth walk to special places in the rainforest, have their baby, then return
to these maternity huts, where they are supposed to stay for up to three months
(even though most young women these days find excuses to go back into their
usual houses after only a few perfunctory weeks). During the entire period a
woman is in a maternity hut, no man is supposed to visit her or even set eyes
upon her and her newborn baby because villagers believe that the quantities of
blood and uterine fluids discharged during childbirth make a woman and her
newborn infant “hot” – that is to say, scalding, dangerous. Females are not as
vulnerable to the effects of other women’s “heat” (since they are, themselves,
“hot”), and female visitors drop by a maternity hut throughout the day, usually
accompanied by their younger child siblings and their own babies, if they have
any. They bring food, water and gossip about the goings-on in the village from
which the new mother is temporarily excluded.
It was not gender-appropriate for me to sit in the maternity huts with new

Tayap Text 1: Two men are chased by their lover’s ghost
Narrated by Raya Ayarpa in 1987
English translation
I am going to tell the story of the old ancestors of Mbwadum. Once upon a
time (lit. before, in the old days) two men went to the Turuŋgwad clan. Kanjaŋ
village. For mangrove slugs. They were going to go and they went to their
lover and asked her: “Are you OK? We’re going to go for mangrove slugs at the
Turuŋgwad clan”.
She told them, “The two of you go. I’m not a baby bird who is going to swallow
a seed and die”.
Hearing her talk, they went. With their best dog, they went to the Turuŋgwad
clan. In Kanjaŋ village. Thus they went and the people of the Turuŋgwad clan
gave them gifts. They gave them the gift of two sticks of dried slug meat and they
sent them on their way and the two of them came back up [home].
The two came up and went and came up to the Kirmar grassland.
The woman too had died and her ghost went there. She went they came up.
They came up toward the grassland. They came up toward the Krimar grassland
and she asked them, “So the two of you come now, do you?”
The two answered, “Yes”. They asked her, “Where are you going?”
“I have children who are crying, so I’m going to Kandumsik stream to try and
net some fish”.
“OK. You go on then, in that case”.
She passed by them and put down her things, turned and cleared her throat
and said, “Who are you? Are you my lovers? It’s me”.
They threw down their two sticks of slugs and then she chased them. She
chased them and brought them [towards the village]. She chased them and
brought them.
The dog stood and was fighting with the spirit woman while the two ancestors picked up speed and came. The dog was fighting, fighting, fighting with the
spirit woman. Leaving her, he then came to the two ancestors. He came, came,
came, came, came, he came down to them.
The spirit woman came close to them and he [the dog] stood and fought. He
was fighting with the spirit as the two ancestors came [towards the village].They
continued in that way [i.e. the dog and woman fighting, the men fleeing] for a longhttps://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-010Tayap Text 1: Two men are chased by their lover’s ghost291time in the forest far away from the village, and finally they came and appeared at
the bottom of Mbwadum mountain. They came up along the mountain.
Children were below playing on the slope, they were shooting arrows at little
coconuts. They were shooting arrows at little coconuts when the two men came
up to them. They told them: “Call out to us!”. The children called out to them: “O!
O! O! O! O! O!”
They [the men] fell and rolled down and died, their two bodies lay there
below. Their dog died together with them.
The spirit woman, she had brought them thusly and she stood there and then
she turned and left them.
Leaving them, she went away. The two men were laying there and they [other
men], thinking this must have something to do with ghosts, got a branch and spit
magic chants on it and as they were trying to bring them back, the two men got up.
The others asked them: “What did this to you?”
“The ghost, our girlfriend, chased us and came and her heat [i.e. her power]
affected us and so we died”.
“OK”, said the others, “Come on then [back to the village]”.","[309, 310, 311]"
"Nouns59As the chart suggests, even though snakes and cassowaries are commonly
masculine, a short, fat snake or a squat, short-necked cassowary could be referred
to using feminine forms.
The shape-based assignment of gender is not entirely predictable, however.
A praying mantis is generally masculine, perhaps because its name is homophonous with ‘cassowary’ (i.e. ŋgat). And a millipede (kakámatik), even though it is
long, is generally feminine, perhaps because it is stubby, fat, and slow moving,
at least compared to a centipede (yandum), which is sleek and slithering (and
generally masculine).
Even though nouns tend to be generally classified as feminine, there are
some nouns which are always (in the case of natural phenomena and insects) or
tend to be (in the case of animals and birds) masculine.
The nouns in question are:
Natural phenomenaAnimals, birds and insectsarawer ‘sun’
ŋgudum ‘star’
nekan ‘earthquake’
aruat ‘thunder’
pora ‘wind’
urerŋgar ‘lightning’aram ‘snake’

ŋgat ‘cassowary’; ‘praying

This gender system shares some similarity with the East Sepik, Ndu family language Manambu, in which gender assignment is determined in part by the size
and shape of the referent (Aikhenvald et al. 2008; see also Reesink 2003 on North
Papuan languages). Aikhenvald et al. (2008: 112) note that shape-based gender
assignment is a feature of languages of the Sepik area, also citing Alamblak (Bruce603 Word classes1984). Other languages of the Sepik-Ramu region have gender, but very different
systems: Foley (2000: 366) notes for instance that Lower Sepik languages have a
phonological gender system; that is, gender assignment is based on the phonological form of the noun root.
On the other hand, the situational element to Tayap’s gender system – in
which gender is partly a matter of the discourse situation rather than a fixed
property of a noun – is reminiscent of that of Bilua, a Papuan language spoken
on Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands. In Bilua, masculine gender is used
for third-person singular masculine human referents as well as “singulative”
non-human nouns. But all other nouns are marked feminine, the default form
(Obata 2003: 88, 105–109).","[78, 79, 80]"

"7.1.2.1 Intransitive imperatives
The imperative forms of intransitive verbs are the single most salient grammatical feature of Tayap, both for the speakers of Tayap and for everyone else in the
lower Sepik area who has ever heard of the language. Whenever Tayap speakers talk about their vernacular, they merrily tell anyone who is willing to listen
that Tayap “is broken into a woman’s language and a man’s language” (“i bruk
long tok ples bilong ol meri na tok ples bilong ol man”). If you want to talk to a
woman, they explain patiently, you have to use the “women’s language” (“tok
ples bilong ol meri”). If you want to talk to a man, you have to use the “tok ples
bilong ol man”.
Anyone who has followed this grammar this far knows that Tayap does indeed
have a number of gender-specific forms, such as the difference in first-person
forms for intransitive verbs inflected in the non-future tense (a male says ŋa mbot
‘I went’; a female says ŋa mbok; see Section 6.2). But this particular gendered
distinction is not primarily what the villagers have in mind when they talk about
how their language is broken in two.
Instead, the villagers who describe Tayap in that way are referring to a single
feature of grammar, namely the different forms that the imperative of an intransitive verb takes when it is addressed to a woman or to a man. The dramatic way
villagers describe this feature of their grammar, however – that you have to speak
to men and women using their specific “languages” – makes it seem as though
the entire Tayap language is “broken” in two.
The villagers’ exegesis carries the unspoken implication that even parts of
speech like nouns have female and male forms, and that both those forms must
be mastered in order to be able to talk at all. Non-Gapuners who listen to Gapun
villagers describe Tayap in this way always react with understandable dismay,
and they inevitably shake their heads in wonder that a human language could
possibly be so complex. Some of them then go off and augment the complexitySubjunctive (sbj)203further, informing others that, in fact, Tayap is “broken” into four languages: one
for women, one for men, one for girls and one for boys.
Gapuners’ story about Tayap’s difference from other vernacular languages
must have arisen because no other language in the area marks gender on the
imperative forms of intransitive verbs. This is a salient feature of language
because whenever villagers from different places meet, one way many of them
enjoy spending time is to quiz one another on what one calls common objects –
‘betel nut’, ‘lime’ (for chewing betel nut), ‘tobacco’, ‘pig’, ‘dog’ and ‘sago jelly’
are the inevitable ones – in their respective vernaculars.
Once these words have been exchanged, many people then go on to ask
about simple verbs: “How do you tell someone to come?”, they ask each other;
“How do you say ‘go’?”. Anyone asking a Tayap speaker that question will
receive the spiel about the vernacular being “broken in two” in response, and
so the story about the bizarreness of the little language that really is two – or is
it four? – separate languages gets perpetuated and spread throughout the lower
Sepik area.
Despite the hype, however, the imperative form of an intransitive verb is
a simple construction. All it involves is (a) a verb stem inflected to express a
speaker’s wish that another person do something – in other words, a verb stem
inflected in the subjunctive mood – and (b) a subject ending that marks gender
and number. So the imperative for any intransitive verb is formed in the following
way (recall that 2nd person dual uses the plural form; see the discussion that
precedes example (3-73)):subjunctive verb stem+
+
+-tet (2sg.m.r)
-tak (2sg.f.r)
-nkem (2pl.r|dl)The subjunctive stem of a verb is almost always the same as the form that verb
takes in the irrealis status. Examples are:

addresseeb. female
addresseepruk-tet

‘You all go!’muŋgo-nkem
stand.sbj-2pl.r
‘You all stand!’pruk-nkem
work.sbj-2pl.r
‘You all work!’In all the examples above, the stem form of the verb in the subjunctive is identical to the stem form of those verbs in the irrealis status. There are exceptions to
this pattern (for intransitive verbs; transitive verbs have exceptions discussed in
7.1.2.2), however, such as the following, where the verbs have a subjunctive-specific form:
(7-3) a. ai (irr) ‘come’ → we- (sbj, so: we-tet, we-tak, we-nkem; see example
7-1 above)
b. tutu (irr) ‘sit’ → tuto- (sbj, so: tuto-tet, tuto-tak, tuto-nkem)
Verb roots ending in r gain the vowel e before the imperative ending, which is
also stressed:
(7-4) a. rar (irr) ‘ look’ → raré- (sbj, so: raré-tet, raré-tak, raré-nkem)
b. sir (irr) ‘descend’→ siré- (sbj, so: siré-tet, siré-tak, siré-nkem)
If these exceptions only occurred in the imperative mood, it would be possible to
simply classify them as exceptions and maintain that the stem form of an imperative verb is its irrealis form. However, the stem forms of verbs in the imperative mood are also the forms that occur for verbs inflected to express an indirect
command (see below 7.1.4). This fact indicates that the underlying form for imperative forms is a subjunctive wish – in other words, ‘You go!’ takes the grammatical
form of ‘(I want that) you go!’.
For that reason, the stem forms of verbs inflected in the imperative are classified as subjunctive rather than irrealis, even though their realization in speech is
most often identical with the irrealis forms.","[222, 223, 224]"

"General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun3But despite positive sentiments toward Tayap, day-to-day village life is now
overwhelmingly conducted in Tok Pisin. Village-wide meetings are in Tok Pisin,
church services are in Tok Pisin, gatherings in the men’s house are in Tok Pisin,
chatter on the field during soccer matches is in Tok Pisin, talk among women
visiting new mothers in maternity houses is in Tok Pisin. Informal conversations
involving villagers over thirty-five often involve code-switching between Tayap
and Tok Pisin, depending on who is present. But most conversations in Gapun,
between most people, take place mostly in Tok Pisin. Even private, intimate conversations occur overwhelmingly in Tok Pisin: young men who go off together in
groups to engage in secret rituals that make them feel lighter and more attractive
speak Tok Pisin to one another. Husbands and wives under thirty, when they are
alone together, speak Tok Pisin – a fact I know because when I asked a husband
or a wife to give me their opinion on their spouse’s competence in Tayap, they
usually answered that they couldn’t, because they almost never heard their
spouse speak Tayap.
When villagers panic – for example when a drunken young man hurls himself
through the village swinging a machete at anyone he sees, or when a child is
bitten by a death adder in the middle of the village and no one knows where it
went – on occasions like those, the overwhelming bulk of everyone’s alarmed
screams to one another, tellingly, is in Tok Pisin, not Tayap.
Equally tellingly, even senior villagers’ admonitions to younger people to
speak Tayap tend to be shouted in Tok Pisin. There is never any consistent effort
to teach children Tayap; indeed, whenever young people do occasionally attempt
to say something in it, any adult who hears them will often dismiss them with
a chuckle or a sneer, and loudly bemoan how poorly they speak the vernacular
language.
Language loss is inevitably linked to cultural change, and during the past
few decades, Gapun has changed dramatically. The changes have not been economic: Gapun villagers of today are not materially much better off than their greatgrandparents. Nor are villagers radically different from their post-war predecessors
in terms of their understandings of their place in the world: like their grandparents, today’s villagers still believe that Papua New Guineans are “the last country”
and that one day, hopefully soon, Jesus will return to Earth and bestow upon them
all the goods and riches that they believe He has already rewarded white people
with, everywhere else in the world. (The complexity of all this is the subject of my
two anthropological monographs on the village, Kulick 1992 and Kulick 2019.)
What makes villagers of today very different from the generation born in
the 1940s and earlier is that the overwhelming majority of the social, cultural
and ritual practices that link them to their history have vanished. The men’s
house cult, which for generations was the backbone of Gapun culture, is broken.","[22, 23]"
"Orthography452.8 Orthography
The Tayap orthography in this grammar and dictionary uses letters of the English
alphabet that correspond to the language’s phonemes, with two exceptions: ɨ
and ŋ. The phonemes /ɵ/ and /ŋ/ would be difficult to render using the letters
used to write English or Tok Pisin. Tayap is almost never written, and any villager
who does so invents his or her own nonce orthography. In my years of contact with
the villagers, I have received many letters from them, always written in Tok Pisin.
At the very end of these letters, though, after the writer has finished asking me for
money (which is always the sole reason for sending me a letter), he or she often
concludes with a line written in Tayap, to add coercive punch to the requests.
A typical example is the phrase Aowo grag engon yu na na, which occurred at
the very end of a letter that had just instructed me to send the writer the equivalent of $8,000 (at a time when the yearly income for the entire village was about
$500). The interjection aowo is an orthographic rendering of a sound used by
villagers to convey worry and longing, and the rest, ‘good evening to you’, is a
Tayap calque of Tok Pisin’s “gutpela apinun long yu”. The unambiguous meaning
of the Tayap phrase is: ‘I worry about you, so now you worry about me and send
me eight thousand dollars’.
The orthography that villagers have come up with to write Tayap varies from
writer to writer and from occasion to occasion. However, one convention that has
developed over the years regards /ɵ/, which is sometimes written as h, and /ŋ/,
which is often rendered as either nh or ngh. This convention may be the invention
of Amburi Waiki, who was in his late twenties and the village prayer leader in the
mid-1980s. Amburi was the only person in Gapun to write anything in Tayap at
that time, and his orthography – which he himself applied erratically – was seen
by others and perhaps adopted by them. (What Amburi wrote on loose pages and
in school workbooks were the names of villagers who had contributed money to
the village church, and the names of areas of rainforest that he wanted to note
down for various reasons.)
This way of handling Tayap’s phonemes results in a sentence like the following, which Amburi wrote down for me in the 1980s: Ngha nghing ana mbet (‘I have
come for them’).
The problem with the orthography used to write this sentence is that it is
difficult for villagers to parse and read. It makes no distinction between free and
bound morphemes (-ana, ‘for’ or ‘to’, for example, is a bound morpheme that
cannot occur on its own), and literate villagers, who have learned to read by being
drilled in school with texts in English, have difficulty with the sheer number of
letters used to denote simple sounds. (In the orthography used in this grammar
and dictionary the sentence would be written Ŋa ŋgɨnana mbet.)462 Phonology and orthographyA sentence produced in 2009 by a literate villager who I asked to demonstrate
to me how he would write something in Tayap shows that the same problems
have persisted: Nhang nhan patir engon nhayar (‘My house is very nice’). The
orthography is internally inconsistent – the word written engon is pronounced
[εŋgɔn], and thus should be written enhgon, if the conventions of this orthography were followed consistently.
This orthography also quickly gets messy. For example, in the sentence just
quoted, a common word like ŋaŋan (‘my’) is written as two words and spelled
nhang nhan. In other instances, simple pronouns like ŋɨ [ŋɵ] (‘he’) and ŋgɨ [ŋgɵ]
(‘they’) tend to stump village writers, who might write them as nghi and nghgh,
respectively – although they would more likely avoid writing them or give up
trying to write them.
Words with the consonant cluster /ŋg/ also pose difficulties. A name like
‘Saŋgi’ – which the villagers’ orthography should render as something like
Sanhgi – looks strange to the villagers when they see it written out in this way
(they would in this case write ‘Sangi’). Worse, a name like ‘Saŋgiŋgi’, which
might be written something like Sanhginhgi, would make villagers who try to use
their invented orthography throw up their hands in despair.
Because of those difficulties, which villagers perceive and talk about themselves, I do not adopt their orthographic inventions to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/. Instead, I
introduce two additional letters, ɨ and ŋ. These letters are ordered so that ɨ follows
i in the alphabet, and ŋ follows n.
While I depart from the villagers’ attempts to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/, I do follow
their loose convention of orthographically marking prenasalization on the voiced
word-initial stops /b/ and /d/ and on the affricate /dʒ/. Villagers vary on whether
or not they orthographically mark word-initial nasalization on the velar stop
/g/: a word like ‘cassowary’, spelled ŋgat in this orthography, would probably be
written ngat by most villagers.
On the other hand, though, some of them write ŋgrag ‘evening’ as grag (see
above, the example of a villager’s letter asking me for $8,000). Regardless of how
they would write a word-initial /g/, however, Tayap speakers consistently prenasalize the phoneme when they pronounce it in this position. Hence, I mark this
in the orthography.
This concession to village pronunciation and writing conventions means that
the orthography used here is not as economical as it otherwise might have been.
I could have omitted the nasalization in words beginning with /b/, /d/, /j/ and
/g/ and simply noted that those phonemes are all obligatorily nasalized wordinitially (this is what Christopher Stroud and I did in our 1993 sketch grammar).
In the end, though, I decided that since the only people who might conceivably ever actually use the orthography employed here are the speakers of Tayap,Orthography47their perceptual biases and already-established habits were more important than
an economical orthography. As I just noted, villagers who write anything in Tayap
vary in whether or not they mark the prenasalization before a word-initial /g/. But
they would find it counter-intuitive and odd to see or write bor ‘pig’, je ‘dog’ or der
‘path’ when they say – and would write – mbor, nje and nder.
I therefore write words the way the villagers pronounce them, with the result
that there are no words in the dictionary that begin orthographically with b, d, j
or g.
Word-medial and word-final prenasalized consonants are written as they are
most commonly pronounced, thus the j in munje ‘man’ is written as prenasalized,
as it is normally pronounced, versus mbubujiram ‘bubbles from fish, crocodiles,
turtles emerging from underwater’, which is written unprenasalized.
This orthographic convention would also logically entail changing the spelling of the villagers’ home, Gapun, to Ŋgapun. However, ‘Gapun’ is not a Tayap
word. Senior men in the 1980s told me that they had heard that Germans had
given the name Gapun to their village – which is called Tayap num ‘Tayap village’
in Tayap.
No one knows why ‘Gapun’ was chosen, but the most likely explanation is
that when German cartographers and labor recruiters first appeared in the lower
Sepik area in the early decades of the 1900s, they asked coastal villagers the
names of inland villages which they could not reach, and they wrote down some
version of the names they received in response. The Kopar-language name for
Gapun, for example, is Saŋgap.
No great leap of imagination is required to see how a name like that, through
various mis-hearings and confusions, could end up as Gapun. A significant percentage of the colonial records from the lower Sepik area were destroyed during
WWII, so I have been unable to uncover any information that directly sheds light
on the question of why Gapun is called Gapun.
But whatever the story behind the German naming of the village may be, the
spelling of ‘Gapun’ can remain unchanged, since it is not a Tayap word.
Note that stress is marked where it is a property of a lexical morpheme (for
example, wákare (‘no’), but in the rest of the grammar it is not marked it when it
is a product of complex morpho-phonemics e.g. like kakúndara in (2-14a) above.
Out of respect for villagers’ writing habits (and also to be consistent with the
analysis of the language’s phonology discussed above, where no VVV clusters
are permitted), I have also changed the spelling of the name of the language and
people from Taiap – as I have spelled it in all my previous work on Gapun – to
Tayap.
Whenever villagers write their name for themselves, they always spell it
Tayap. And the word is a popular one to write. The front of one house near the482 Phonology and orthographycenter of the village, for example, is adorned with large letters, painted in black
battery acid, that proclaims (tellingly, in Tok Pisin), NIU LUK TAYAP (‘New Look
Tayap’).
Another young man, upping the linguistic ante in the direction of what many
villagers have understood is the even more prestigious language, used similar
material to paint the words NEW HOME TAYAP on a wall in his house.
A young man with whom I was walking along the beach one day, making
the six-hour trip to the village of Watam to see if the local health worker there
had any medicine for a bad case of scabies I had acquired in the village (she
didn’t), paused at one point to scratch the words NICK OUTCAST PERSON K*B*H*
ROR TAYAP MUNJE into the sand. Translated, this means ‘Nick outcast person
K[ambedagam] B[lue] H[ill] child Tayap man’ – the K*B*H* part of the message
being a name the young villagers have given to their mountain.
Nick’s scribble in the sand doesn’t make much sense in either of the two languages in which it is written. But that is typical of the way that the word Tayap is
used in young villagers’ writing: it is used more as a marker or a tag than as an
attempt to convey referential meaning. Nick’s writing is a slightly more elaborate
variant of the words Tayap ror (Tayap child), which is a popular tag that young
men and women like to carve into trees or add after their signature at the end of
a love letter. The words are modeled on the Tok Pisin word “mangi”, which used
to mean ‘child’, but which during the past thirty years has acquired the sassier
meaning of ‘young person’ or, better, ‘kid’.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68]"
"Villagers’ debates and language shift
Something similar to the ‘wind problem’ occurred with a word that I would have
thought was common and uncontroversial – the word for ‘rainbow’. One morning344Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionaryafter a night of heavy rain, a large rainbow appeared in the sky. On my way to
wash my clothes in one of the village waterholes, I saw the rainbow and realized
that I didn’t know what it was called in Tayap. So I asked the first person I saw – a
fluent speaker of Tayap in his late thirties – what one calls a rainbow in Tayap.
“Renbo”, he responded, without missing a beat.
Um, no, I told him, that must be the Tok Pisin word – the Tayap word had to be
something else. The man told me that in that case, he didn’t know, and that I should
go ask his father, sixty-five-year-old Monei Mbanaŋ, who was my main language
informant at the time. I went off to find Monei and thus did my innocent query
launch a month of acrimonious debate from one end of the village to the other.
I found Monei sitting on his veranda and I asked him the word for rainbow.
He pondered for awhile. He told me he couldn’t remember the word offhand; he
needed to think about it. He thought for several days. Finally, he told me that
‘rainbow’ had no single word in Tayap; instead, ‘rainbow’ was expressed by the
verb phrase akɨn tamtiek, ‘cloud is marked with color’. This sounded reasonable
to me, and I duly recorded it. But when I repeated it to other speakers to check
their reactions, I was universally met with disdain. “Em giaman” – ‘He’s lying’,
everyone sneered, using their favorite expression to dismiss another speaker’s
expertise in Tayap. Even though no one could think of the correct term themselves,
they all told me they knew that the phrase Monei had volunteered was wrong.
Days went by and no one could come up with ‘rainbow’. Older villagers
explained to me that their parents and older relatives had warned them about
rainbows, saying they should never walk underneath one, because if they did,
their minds would become clouded and confused. But even though they remembered these cautions, no senior speaker could recall the word for ‘rainbow’
that their parents and relatives had used while articulating them. The word for
‘rainbow’, villagers told me, “i hait” – it was hiding. (In the villagers’ defense, I
should note that rainbows are not exactly common occurrences in Gapun – I only
saw that one the entire eight months I was there in 2009).
Eventually Monei’s old wife, Sopak Waiki, told me that she had a dream in
which the true word for ‘rainbow’ had been whispered to her by a dead ancestor.
The word, she revealed, was mɨnuomb – a word that otherwise means ‘large
round lake’. Sopak said that the way to say ‘rainbow’ in Tayap was to say akɨnnɨ
mɨnuomb utok, ‘a round lake appeared in the clouds’.
I told other senior speakers of Sopak’s revelation. They were unmoved. “Em
giaman”, they all pronounced, impassively.
A few days later, one of the oldest men in the village told me that he had
remembered the word – it was wagurmos.
The other speakers’ judgement fell predictably: “Em giaman”, they all said.
They explained that wagurmos meant the white film one sees in the sky at nightVillagers’ debates and language shift345– that is, the Milky Way. It doesn’t mean ‘rainbow’ at all. Many older speakers also
took the opportunity to disparage the linguistic knowledge of the old man who
had offered wagurmos. That speaker may be old, they said belittlingly, but he’s
“lapun nating” – he’s grown old without having learned anything. All he has,
people said, is “bebi sens” – the sense of a baby.
Weeks passed and frustration grew. But finally, having heard about the
senior speakers’ search for ‘rainbow’, a young man in his 30s one day came and
told me that he had once heard his grandfather, Kruni Ayarpa, say the word for
‘rainbow’. Kruni had been one of my language informants in the 1980s; he died
in the early 1990s. For the last few decades of his life, Kruni had been universally
respected and vaguely feared as an elder who knew everything about Gapun’s
history and who spoke flawless and eloquent Tayap. The young man reported
that as a child, he had once been together with Kruni when women from the
neighboring village of Wongan mentioned rainbows, which are called mamor in
their Kopar language. They asked Kruni what the word in Tayap was. Kruni told
them that it was mamar.
Rather than being a breakthrough, this word, too, was rejected. “It means
‘banana’”, all the old people responded dryly when, without telling them why, I
asked them to define mamar. And indeed, it does mean a kind of banana. But in
the end, unable to come up with a word or expression that satisfied them all, and
undoubtedly growing annoyed at my persistence in questioning them, the older
villagers begrudgingly agreed that mamar must be the word for ‘rainbow’ too,
since Kruni apparently had claimed it was.
My own conclusion is that mamar probably was the Tayap word for ‘rainbow’.
Tayap and Kopar share quite a few nouns, because speakers of the two languages
have been in contact with one another for a very long time. The kind of slight
phonetic variation between mamor and mamar are common in the words shared
by the two languages. For example:crocodile
cockatoo
turtle
lorikeet
hookTayap
orem
kaimwa
pawp
njijerɨk
pipiŋgabuKopar
oreo
keimwa
pup
njijerɨŋ
bibigabuFor those all those reasons, I have entered ‘rainbow’ as one of the definitions of
mamar. I recount the little epic of finally getting that word, though, in order to
illustrate the fact that not all of the entries contained in this dictionary will satisfy
all the current speakers of Tayap.","[363, 364, 365]"

up wodownstream ato81RAINFORESTupstream wuriMANGROVE LAGOON
down sireThe vertical axis refers to the spatial elevationals of ‘up’ and ‘down’, for
instance being up in a tree or down on the ground.
The horizontal axis refers to the geographical relationship between the rainforest and the mangrove lagoon. The mangrove lagoon that villagers have to cross
to get to the neighboring village of Wongan runs to the sea and lies to the north
of Gapun. The rainforest, in which the villagers live and into which they walk
every day to find sago palms to process and game to hunt, lies all around the
village, but most of the vast areas of their traditional land lies roughly south of
Gapun. In relation to the mighty Sepik River, which can be seen from the top of
the mountain where Gapun village was situated until after World War II, the mangrove lagoon is ‘downstream’, and the rainforest is ‘upstream’. This is the sense
in which villagers say they went ‘down’ to Wongan and then came back ‘up’ to
Gapun. These directionals are relative to one another, so that when one has gone
‘up’ into the rainforest, one comes ‘down’ to Gapun village when one returns.
Note that the terms also cover all space within the village.

Tayap has a single set of pronouns that occur in three different cases: absolutive,
ergative and possessive.
The possessive pronouns are formed by adding the possessive clitic = ŋa(n)
to the absolutive-case pronouns (with some irregularities), and the ergative pronouns are formed by adding the nominal ergative clitics (see Section 4.3) to the
absolutive forms, again with some irregularities. Note that bound pronominal
forms are listed below and discussed in Section 5.3.

"Cosubordinate constructions275In all three types of clause chains, negation occurs once and has scope over
the whole construction.
Tayap cosubordinate constructions differ from serial verb constructions in
that medial verbs have an obligatory linking suffix, whereas non-final verbs in
serial verb constructions do not, and serial verb constructions generally form
a single phonological word whereas cosubordinate constructions do not (see
Section 8.2 for discussion of serial verb constructions).
One unusual facet of Tayap’s medial-final constructions is that they do not
typically form the long chains that Papuan languages in general are so famous
for. The majority of medial-final chains in Tayap consist of a single medial verb
followed by a final verb. This might be in part because the final verb has to be a
verb of motion.
An alternative analysis of these constructions, in particular -r and -kar, is that
they are adverbial suffixes, rendering an adverb from a verb. However a cosubordinate analysis is preferred here as negation operates across clause boundaries
to cover the whole construction rather than negating the putative adverb directly
(see below, Section 9.8.2).","[294, 295]"
"3.4.4 Adverbials of frequency and distribution and ‘not yet’
Two adverbials in Tayap express frequency and distribution (-re), and the temporal relationship ‘not yet’ (ŋgo wákare). Note the formal parallel with the locative =re (see Section 3.4.3 above and Section 4.4); presumably these forms, while
having different functions, have the same origin. The suffix -re occurs on nouns,
and always involves reduplication, as the following examples show.
-re ‘every’

The relative geographical position of objects and people is expressed in Tayap
much more frequently than it is in a language like English. When leaving
someone’s company, for example, one doesn’t just say ‘I’m going’, but rather,
‘I’m going up (in the direction of the rainforest)’ or ‘I’m going down (in the
direction of the mangrove lagoon)’. Similarly, if you have just arrived back
in Gapun from a trip to the village of Wongan, and someone asks you where
you have been, the correct answer is not ‘I was in Wongan’, but ‘I was down
in Wongan’.
Elevational and positional relationships are lexically encoded in Tayap’s rich
set of verbs of motion, virtually all of which are being lost because of their irregular inflectional patterns (see Section 6.2.3). But Tayap also has a set of two freestanding elevationals and seven positionals that are used to pinpoint the location
of an object or a person.
Four of these are oriented according to a spatial array consisting of two axes.","[99, 100]"

"2 Semantic error: the verb nam- ‘tell’ is incorrect here; the speaker wants kotar-(p)-e- ‘ask’.
Grammatical errors: the speaker omits the ergative clitic on the subject of the verb, and also
omits a locative case marker on Yengia, the undergoer of the verb. The grammatically correct way
of phrasing the question is:

Tayap has five peripheral cases. Three of the cases mark animate and inanimate
referents differently.
The possessive case marks possession, association and part-whole relationships, with no distinction between alienable and inalienable possession.
Possession is discussed in Section 4.5.
The locative case has the widest semantic scope of Tayap’s peripheral cases. It
specifies location in time and space, covering relationships that in other languages
are expressed in allative, instrumental, comitative, temporal and durative cases.
The ablative case expresses movement away from a person, place or object,
or an action of revelation in which something that was hidden becomes visible.
The perlative case expresses movement along, through or by means of.
The dative case is used to mark recipient, purpose, comparison and a number
of other relations.
All these peripheral case markers are clitics, as they occur attached to the last
element of an NP with scope over the whole NP: see for example (4-40i), (4-40j),
(4-42b), (4-43d), (4-43i), among others. Many of them contain optional material
(shown in parentheses), the conditioning factors of which are not known.
Examples (the relevant peripheral case clitics are in bold):

"2027 Mood7.1.2 Imperative
The imperative mood expresses a command that is directly addressed to one
person (‘you come!’) or to several people (‘you all come!’). In Tayap there are two
kinds of imperatives: positive imperatives – commands to do something – and
negative imperatives, commands to not do something.
Negative imperatives have a particular morphology and are discussed under
prohibitives and admonitives (see Sections 7.2 and 7.3).
Positive imperatives – a command that an addressee perform some action –
are realized differently for intransitive and transitive verbs.","[221, 222]"
"241 The Tayap language and its speakersThe priest asked the girl’s father if he wanted the name ‘Tema’ (the girl’s
mother’s wishes or opinions – in keeping with Catholic practice – were not solicited or considered).
The father answered by looking down at his feet and saying softly, “If you
want to change it, that’s alright” (“Sapos yu laik sensim bai mi bihainim yu”).
“No”, the priest said to him. “Do you want that name?” (“Nogat, yu laikim
despela nem tu?”)
The father repeated himself, “If you want to change it, that’s alright”.
“But do you like the name?” the priest wanted to know. (“Na yu laikim tu?”)
“Yeah”, said the father reluctantly and barely audibly, “Em i orait” (“It’s OK”).
Thus did little Anunciata become baptized as Tema, a name that the parents
don’t like at all, and that, consequently, has never been uttered by anyone since
that moment of baptism.
In day-to-day life, most villagers are called by their village names. A handful
of people, however, are usually called by their Christian name, either because
they want to foreground their Catholic piety, or because their parents never really
liked the village names given to their child, so they got around it by always calling
the child by his or her Christian name.
For official purposes such as school enrollment or electoral rolls, villagers are
identified by their Christian name and the village name of their father. So Ŋgero,
one of my main language informants in 2009, is identified in official contexts as
Prisila Sair.
This patrilineal naming practice is contrary to and corrosive of how villagers
reckon kinship, which is matrilineally – a villager belongs to the clan of her or
his mother, not her or his father. Increasingly, however, as a direct result both
of Catholic teaching and government sanctioned conventions such as official
naming practices, fathers are asserting rights over their children, and are beginning to “take” their children into their clans with a frequency that far exceeds
past practice.
Important mythical ancestors, deities and spirits also have names, as do all
the areas of Gapun’s vast rainforest. The more esoteric names for the ancestors
and deities vanished from Tayap in the 1990s with the last of the village’s truly
knowledgeable big men. Those men declined to pass on the names to their matrilineal nephews, as used to be happen, because, they told me in the 1980s, the
names were powerful elements in sorcery chants and could be used to kill people.
The big men who made this decision were all strongly Catholic, and they believed
that their traditional knowledge was part of what was preventing Gapuners from
changing into white people (Kulick 1992).
Tayap words for commonly visited areas of the rainforest remain known
among villagers, because they walk through the forest every day to hunt, gatherTayap linguistic profile25food and go to their gardens or sago swamps. The names of places rarely visited
by villagers and that are several days’ walk from the village are less well known,
and only the oldest people in the village can recite them, after long consultations
with one another.","[43, 44, 45]"

Don’s Acknowledgements:
The research on which this book is based was made possible by generous research
grants by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and the Swedish Research Council. I am grateful to my former employer,
the University of Chicago, for granting me the research leave that allowed me
to return to Gapun and conduct fieldwork for nine months during 2009, and for
leave to visit Gapun for several months in 2010, 2012 and 2014. I am grateful to my
current employer, Uppsala University, for leave to travel to the town of Madang in
order to complete the final draft of this book in spring 2018.
In Papua New Guinea, I thank James Robins and Georgia Kaipu, of Papua
New Guinea’s National Research Institute, for their impressive skill in negotiating the bureaucracy involved in obtaining a research visa. I owe a large debt to
Divine Word University in the town of Madang, which generously provided me
with a place to live while I worked on the final version of this text. The late Nancy
Sullivan, whose feisty and festive presence in Madang was instrumental in luring
me back to Papua New Guinea after an absence of fifteen years, is deeply, sorely
missed. Other people in Madang whose company and support I value are John
Mackerell, John Burton, Pam Norman, Cecilia Nembou, Fidelma Takaili, Iwona
Kolodziejczyk, Gert van den Berg, Patricia Paraide, David Lloyd, Edwina Jangi,
Sr. Miriam Dlugosz, and Frs. Philip Gibbs, Patrick Gesch, and Garrett Roche.
I am grateful to several colleagues who generously provided me with
support over the years. Many years ago, Christopher Stroud worked with me to
make initial sense of Tayap, and I gratefully acknowledge his contributions to
my understanding of the language. Eva Lindström shared much appreciated
pre-fieldwork technical advice about audio recorders, Toughbook computers and
solar panels. Two stays at ANU in Australia, one of them as a visiting fellow at
ANU’s Humanities Research Centre, facilitated by Nick Evans and Alan Rumsey,
were extremely important in the development of this text. Andy Pawley gave me
very helpful advice in relation to the dictionary, which he read through with care.
Nick Evans provided important encouragement and perspicacious suggestions
about the analysis at several crucial points when I felt stuck.
I am grateful to Bill Foley for reading the entire first draft of the grammar and
providing invaluable feedback.
I want to take this opportunity to explicitly acknowledge the work of my
co-author, Angela Terrill. Upon receiving the reader’s report from an anonymous reviewer that I got back from Pacific Linguistics the first time I submitted
the manuscript in 2011, I recognized that I needed a trained descriptive linguist
https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-201VIIIAcknowledgementsto help me transform the grammar into publishable form. In 2017, I contacted
Angela, who through sheer serendipity happened to be living in Uppsala, the city
in Sweden where I am employed. Angela accepted my invitation to work with
my manuscript, and remarkably, she managed to acquire a feel for Tayap – its
idiosyncrasies and its genius – after only a few months. Angela’s incisive interventions, her continual exhortations that “we need more examples”, her extensive knowledge of Papuan linguistics, and her clear head and good cheer are the
reason why this grammar and dictionary is now finally seeing the light of day.
My greatest debt, obviously, is to the people of Gapun, whom I have known
now for over three decades. Villagers have always seen to it that I have had a
house to live in (three times, in 1987, 1991 and 2009, they have built me a house),
and food to eat. My debt to them is a collective one, and this documentation of
their vernacular language is one way I hope they will sense some repayment of
that debt. Many of the people who worked with me on the intricacies of the Tayap
language are no longer alive, among them my chief language informants in the
1980s, Raya Ayarpa, Kruni Ayarpa and Mukar Raya. In 2009, I worked most intensively on the language with Monei Mbanaŋ, Samek Wanjo and Ŋgero Sair, all of
whom were remarkable teachers. Others to whom I am especially grateful for my
stay in Gapun in 2009 are Mbaso Monei who allowed me to live in a room in his
house when I arrived in Gapun, and his older brother, the village komiti at the
time, Opɨ Monei who organized, cajoled and supervised much of the labor that
eventually built my house.
My greatest single debt during my months in Gapun since I began returning
in 2006 after a fifteen-year absence is to those two men’s younger sister, Ndamor
Monei her husband Mbanu Ajiragi and the couple’s seven sassy children Mbobot,
Mopok, Poniker, Ŋawr, Ŋgayam, Kape and Kaŋirase. The house that villagers built
me in 2009 was in the center of Gapun, right next to Ndamor’s house. Without
anyone ever asking her to do so, Ndamor quietly took it upon herself to make sure
that I was always fed, and she and her daughters kept the area surrounding my
house clean and free from dog feces and pig droppings. Ndamor has one of the
most raucous senses of humor in the village, and now in her mid-forties, she is
also one of the few women in Gapun who still has ferocious and poetic kros-es
(harangues of anger) in Tayap. I loved both her humor and her anger – some of
the most imaginative obscenities quoted in this book are Ndamor’s. Living right
next to Ndamor, in full hearing of everything that went on in her house at all
hours of the day and night, was continually enlightening and hugely entertaining. Whenever I feel nostalgic for Gapun, it is my time spent listening to Ndamor
and talking and laughing with her and her family that I miss the most.
I am grateful to the librarians in Kungliga Biblioteket in Stockholm, who provided me with a forskarplats in the reading room, where I was able to sit andAcknowledgementsIXwrite the entire first draft of this book in brisk enforced silence. I also thank the
Ingmar Bergman Estate for a week long residency in August 2018. There I had the
enormous privilege of putting the final touches on this manuscript sitting at the
writing desk of the great auteur himself.
Finally, I thank Jonas Tillberg, for support, affection and the helicopter.
Angela’s Acknowledgements:
I am grateful to Don Kulick for bringing me into this project, generously sharing
his notes and recordings with me, patiently providing ever more examples, and
most of all for sharing his remarkable knowledge of this intricate and fascinating
language.
Don and Angela’s Acknowledgements:
We both thank Ger Reesink, who revealed himself to be the reviewer of the manuscript we submitted to Pacific Linguistics in spring 2018. In only a few weeks,
Ger had scoured the text with a gimlet eye and fine-toothed comb, noting inconsistencies, recommending literature, suggesting alternative analyses and – most
considerately – remarking on the parts of the text that he particularly enjoyed.
His knowledge of Papuan languages is unsurpassed and this grammar benefits
from it greatly.
We are also deeply grateful to Tim Curnow who did us a wonderful service in
reading the final manuscript with what must have been a microscope, and providing us with almost unbelievably detailed comments. The grammar is much the
better for his thorough and meticulous input.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"
"7.6.2 Supposition (supp)
Another particle, mera, marks the epistemic status of an action or event as something that has been assumed but that the speaker believes does not correspond to
what actually happened. In other words, it is what Tayap speakers use to convey
a meaning like ‘I thought Paita had gone to Wongan’. A statement like that in
English conveys a belief that regardless of whether or not Paita did go to Wongan,
the speaker expected him to but believes that he did not.
The modal particle mera that carries this meaning follows whatever part of
speech is the focus of the assumption. So it can occur after a noun, as in the
following:
(7-43)ŋa ndɨ nda namnak Ŋgemanŋi mera
ŋa ndɨ nda nam
-nak
Ŋgeman =ŋi
mera
1sg dm dm talk.r -1sg.f|1pl.r Ŋgeman =erg.m supp
‘I (f) thought it was Ŋgeman’ (who did it, but it wasn’t)Most commonly, mera follows a verb, thereby reframing what would have been a
statement as a supposition. For example:
(7-44) ŋa namnet ŋɨ Potore okɨnet mera
ŋa nam -net
ŋɨ
Poto
=re
1sg talk.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r 3sg.m Wongan =all
o
-kɨ
-net
mera
go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr supp
‘I (m) thought he would go to Wongan’ (but he didn’t)
Without the modal particle, this sentence would mean ‘I thought: he will go
to Wongan’. Mera turns the statement into an assumption that, moreover, the
speaker believes did not come to pass. Note that these constructions always
involve the use of a phrase like ‘I thought’ or ‘I lied’ as exemplified here.
The particle is also to express the action of having been fooled or lied to. So
‘they lied to us that you were dead’ is:Mood particles(7-45)227ŋgɨgi yim takwattɨmɨro yu wasowtet mera

Kapa encodes surprise. It follows nominals and the closest colloquial English
translation would be the expression ‘that damned X’ in both its positive and negative valences; so both ‘That damned kid really did well’ and ‘That damned cat
peed on my sofa’. Kapa follows pronouns, nouns and noun phrases, as in the

Nímera expresses surprise that a situation has turned out contrary to one’s
expectations. It is a combination of the adverb, ni, which expresses a negative
state – the state of doing nothing or having nothing (see Section 3.4.1) – with the
suppositional particle mera (see above Section 7.6.2).
An example that senior speakers used to explain the particle is as follows:
You tell another person to complete some work and then you leave them, thinking
that the person will not do the work. When you return, you find that the person
actually has done the work, at which point you might say:
(7-47)ŋa ndɨ yu nímera kut
inda
1sg dm 2sg cs
be.r.sg.m.r dx.m
‘I thought you (m) just were here’ (doing nothing, but you weren’t, you
actually worked) (lit: ‘I was like, you just were here’)Another example is that people have come to your house and you expect them to
help you do some work, but they don’t. You might say:
(7-48) yum nímera a
-ku -nana
mbekem?
2pl cs
be.irr -irr intent come.2pl.r
‘So you’ve all come just to be here?’ (and do nothing even though I
expected you to work?)
A final example is that you are carving something and you want to make it look
like an object you have seen before – perhaps a small statue with a traditional
pattern. In the course of carving the piece, though, it ends up looking very different from what you expected. Nímera here expresses the surprise you feel at this:

8.1 Complex predicates and complex clauses
In Tayap, the major division in complex structures is between combining verbs
versus combining clauses. Verb combining in Tayap is accomplished through
complex predicates, which can be serial verb constructions or complex predicates involving the verb ‘to be’. Clause combining is of three types: Coordinate,
subordinate and cosubordinate constructions.
This chapter deals with complex predicates, and the following chapter
(Chapter 9) deals with clause combining.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"

ŋɨ
o-mbrɨ-net
3sg.m strike.irr-3pl.irr.o-1sg.m|
3sg.m.r.s
…he will hit them’The second way of formulating an indirect command involves inflecting both the
verb in the “tell” clause and the verb in the “command” clause in the subjunctive
mood. Contrast example (7-11a) above with the following:
(7-12) Kasek nam
-gɨ
o
-net
Kasek talk.sbj -3sg.m.r.o go.sbj -1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘Tell Kasek to go’
Notice that the verb ‘talk/tell’ in the main clause of (7-12), has no subject morpheme. Comparing ‘tell’ in (7-11a) with ‘tell’ in (7-12), we see the following differences:
(7-13) full form
nam-tɨ-ŋgɨ-n
talk.sbj-s<3sg.m.r.o>2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘tell him’reduced form
nam-gɨ
talk.sbj-3sg.m.r.o
‘tell him’Not only does the reduced form in (7-13) take no subject morpheme; the object
morpheme suffixed to the verb stem is realized without prenasalization. This
means that what is normally realized as -ŋgɨ ‘3sg.m.r.o’ → -gɨ and what is normally realized as -mbɨ ‘3pl.r.o’ → -bɨ. All other object morphemes retain their
regular realis forms.
Now look at the verb in the subordinate clause in (7-12). This form – o-net – is
what is discussed above in Section 7.1 as the subjunctive form of a verb.
Indirect commands are normally introduced with a verb such as nam ‘talk/
tell’. So, again, to express an indirect command, one usually says either (7-14) or
(7-15):
imperative
future
(7-14) Kasek nam-tɨ-ŋgɨ-n
ŋɨ
ŋgo o-kɨ-net

subjunctive
(7-15) Kasek nam-gɨ
o-net
Kasek talk.sbj-3sg.m.r.o go.sbj-1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘tell Kasek to go’ (lit. ‘tell Kasek that he go’)
However, indirect commands can also be formulated without an explicit introductory speech verb. In such cases, the indirect command is expressed in a way
that makes no explicit mention of who is responsible for carrying out the action.
An example of this was uttered during a discussion of the school in the neighboring village of Wongan that village children had gone to until March 2009,
when the teachers suddenly refused to work anymore. The speaker here means
that he wants other villagers to get rid of the striking teachers, whom he refers to
as ‘old’ and one of whom he calls by name (the name has been changed):
(7-16) Aŋgɨ rowesamb aŋgi taman wosmbɨ ondak. Nelson tɨ onet
Aŋgɨ rowe -samb aŋgɨ
taman wos

-net
go.sbj -3pl.r Nelson too
go.sbj -1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘[Tell] every one of those old teachers to piss off. [Tell] Nelson too to go’.
These could also be analyzed as jussives as described above without ŋganokaw,
thus “Let the teachers piss off. Let Nelson go too”.
Negative indirect commands, like ‘I didn’t tell Mbawi to go’, are formed by
negating the main verb (note that it is intransitive) and suffixing the verb in the
subordinate clause with the intentional suffix (see Section 7.4 for discussion of
how the intentional suffix is used):

The final use of the subjunctive in Tayap is in constructions in which a speaker
expresses a desire that some action be performed by someone else or something
else. Here the subjunctive occurs in the “desire” clause, after an expression of
cognition in the main clause. It is the appearance of the verb in its subjunctive
form that generates the meaning of the verb in the main clause as one of desire,
rather than cognition.

from elicitation sessions with senior men in the 1980s. I have not encountered
this construction in any of the conversations or speeches that I have transcribed.
Instead, desire predicates are constructed in one of two ways, none of them
involving the subjunctive.
The first way of forming a desire predicate is with the verb phrase ‘arei + ergative + tar’, which literally means ‘desire takes’. This is a moribund construction:
like examples (7-19a-b) above, my only recorded instances of it are in elicitation
sessions in the 1980s with senior informants.
The construction is realized without overt marking on the main clause, and
the verb in the subordinate clause is inflected for future tense:
(7-20) ŋɨ areiyi tatɨŋgɨn ŋa okɨnet Potowre
ŋɨ
arei
=yi
ta
-tɨ
3sg.m desire =erg.f take.r -s-ŋgɨ

-net
Potow
=re
1sg go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.r Wongan =all
‘he wants me to go to Wongan’ (lit. ‘desire takes him, I will go to Wongan’)
The most common way to express the desire that someone or something else do
something that you want is to use the verb nam, which has the primary meaning
of ‘talk’ or ‘tell’, but which is also used to mean ‘think’ (this kind of semantic
conflation between verbs like “talk”, “tell”, “think” and “desire” is common in
Papuan languages; Reesink 1993).
Desire predicates with nam are constructed the same way as the example
above, that is to say with the verb in the subordinate clause inflected in the future
tense. Speakers also often use the adverb nande ‘thusly’ to draw attention to the
verb of desire, producing sentences like the following:
(7-21) ŋa nande namnet yu okɨtet Ombágire
ŋa nande nam -net
yu o
-kɨ
-tet
1sg thusly talk.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r 2pl go.irr -irr -2sg.m
Ombági=re
Pankin=all
‘I want you to go to Pankin’ (lit. ‘I say/think thusly: you will go to Pankin’)Admonitive (adm)2137.2 Prohibitive (proh)
In contrast to the imperative mood, which expresses the speaker’s command for
the addressee to perform a particular action, the prohibitive is a command to not
perform an action. It can be translated as ‘Don’t do X’, ‘Don’t dare do X’ or ‘X is
prohibited’. The prohibitive cannot be negated. It is formed as follows:
person
ŋa ‘I’
yu ‘you’
ŋgu ‘she’
ŋɨ ‘he’
yim ‘we’
yum ‘you pl’
ŋgɨ ‘they’
dlirr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgarke→
→
→irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgremke
irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgroke
irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgrekeIf a speaker includes the benefactive object in this construction, the action is
marked as ongoing, in the progressive aspect, so it means ‘Don’t be doing X!’

A structure that is morphologically almost identical to the prohibitive occurs in
the modal construction that expresses the non-desirability of an action.
This modality in Tayap has its exact equivalent in the Tok Pisin expression
“nogut X”, where X denotes an action that the speaker doesn’t want to happen,
regrets happening, is uncertain has happened or will happen, or when the speaker
anticipates or senses that something undesirable will ensue from the action’s
occurrence. This is a difficult expression to translate, because it can be a warning,
as in ‘X better not happen/have happened’; a negative hope, as in ‘I hope X doesn’t
happen’ (or, ‘I hoped X wouldn’t happen’); a concern, as in ‘May X not happen’; or
a meditation, like ‘What if X should happen?’. The admonitive cannot be negated.
In Tayap, this construction differs from the prohibitive only in that the final
-ke of the prohibitive markers is -ana in the admonitive, and that there is no benefactive in it:
person
ŋa ‘I’
yu ‘you’
ŋgu ‘she’

better not talk’; said to someone who
knows a secret about another person
and is going to visit that person; the
speaker is expressing the hope that
the person addressed won’t open his
or her mouth and spill the beans7.4 Intentional (intent)
The intentional mood expresses two kinds of events. The first is actions that are
or were intended or desired but that have not been completed or that didn’t occur
or won’t occur. The second kind of event expressed by the intentional mood is an
inevitable action: an action that often, in retrospect, ended in a foreseeable way.
An example of this latter sense is the response of a woman seeing a photograph I
had taken of a gravely ill Monei Mbanaŋ; he had been sick for weeks and I photographed
him as he was about to be carried to a canoe and taken to a hospital, where he died a
few days later. Upon seeing this photograph months after Monei had died, looking at
a desiccated and paralyzed Monei, this woman murmured waso-kɨ-nana (die.irr-irrintent) ‘he’s about to/intending to die’, in a soft, rising voice expressing sorrow.
The intentional mood was mentioned earlier in the section on the near future
tense (5.4.2.3) because it is constructed in a similar way, with the bound morpheme2167 Mood-ana (-nana after a vowel; this form is often reduced and realized as -na) affixed
directly to the irrealis object marker (for transitive verbs) or directly to the irrealis
marker -ki-, -kɨ- or -ku- (for intransitive verbs). So the structure is as follows:
transitive verbsirr verb stem + irr object + -(n)anaintransitive verbsirr verb stem + irr morpheme + -(n)anaExamples of the intentional mood are:

The fact that a meaning of intention or desirability is foregrounded in this construction means that it can also be translated as ‘in order to’ or ‘with the intention

"Bird names
Names for birds are an important exception to Tayap’s otherwise relatively modest
wildlife vocabulary. The extent of Tayap’s bird vocabulary is surprising. The rainforest is full of birds, certainly. But it is also full of other kinds of wildlife, such
as frogs, bats, spiders, and insects that the villagers do not distinguish lexically.
Even large mammals such as the different species of tree possums and cuscus
look very different from one another in terms of size and fur-color, but Tayap classifies them all with the same word, enamb.
Birds (tam) do not make up any particularly noticeable percentage of the
villagers’ diet. Boys kill small birds with slingshots or arrows and roast them
to eat as snacks. During the dry season, young men set traps or build blinds
(pura) in which they hide at dawn and dusk, hoping to shoot large birds like the
turkey-sized crowned pigeon (momɨk) when those fly down to drink at the few
streams and ponds that retain water. Villagers eat cassowary (ŋgat) meat with
gusto, but those big birds are elusive and fierce, and they were killed only rarely
until about 2012, when one village man learned to set rope traps for cassowariesAnimals, insects, fish and birds445and has subsequently killed scores of the birds – so many, in fact, that they are
now becoming increasingly rare throughout the area.
Cassowary eggs are boiled and eaten whenever they are found, and women
and girls regularly dig into the mounds made by scrubfowls (kokosuar) and
brush-turkeys (onaw), searching for their large red eggs (yamiŋe), which are
prized as a delicacy, regardless of what stage of development the egg happens
to be in when it is eaten. Some villagers raise a few domestic chickens (kokok),
but those leathery fowl are only killed on special occasions to impress and honor
visitors, or as part of a conciliatory or funerary feast.
With a few exceptions (cassowaries, eagles and a few small birds), birds do
not feature in the village’s myths and traditional stories. Nor is the plumage of
birds collected, at least nowadays, to make into decorations to wear on festive
occasions.
Despite their relative lack of importance in the villagers’ diet, myths or daily
life, many birds have names in Tayap. I collected more than 70 words for different
bird species. I was able to do this thanks to the marvelous book, Birds of New
Guinea, by Bruce M. Beehler, Thane K. Pratt and Dale A. Zimmerman, illustrated
by Dale A. Zimmerman and James Coe (Princeton University Press, 1986). This
invaluable field guide contains 55 illustrated plates, most in color, depicting
every species of bird known to exist in New Guinea.
Villagers of all ages loved this book. I had others that I used to help me elicit
words for animals, such as Mammals of New Guinea by Tim Flannery (Cornell
University Press, 1995). Those books, though, had photographs of animals, rather
than drawings. Villagers turned out to be much less interested in the photographs than they were in drawings. My impression was that villagers had a hard
time recognizing many animals from their photographs. Many of the photos in
a book like Mammals of New Guinea, it must be said, are not particularly clear.
They are taken from angles, or from distances – for example, in extreme close
up – from which villagers would normally not ever view the animals. There were
also numerous photographs of animals like small bats that villagers call by the
same word, and have little interest in differentiating. Villagers quickly became
bored looking at this book.
The plates in Birds of New Guinea elicited a completely different response.
Older men and women repeatedly returned to the drawings to recognize and
name different kinds of birds. Younger people and children used the drawings to
test each others’ knowledge of bird names.
The following is a list of all the names of birds I was able to elicit from villagers. The English names are from Birds of New Guinea, and for easy identification,
the relevant plate number and drawing number in that book is given in parentheses after the English translation (anyone wishing to know the classificatory Latin446Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionaryname of the birds will find it there). If no drawing number is given, the Tayap
word refers to all birds depicted on that plate.
The overwhelming majority of the birds with names in Tayap have no names
in Tok Pisin, which means that the most convenient way to talk about them is to
use a vernacular language name. Villagers under thirty, especially females, who
do not hunt birds like boys and young men do, generally do not know the names
of birds that are rarely encountered. But for commonly seen birds, the vernacular
names are still known, even by children. Because there are no Tok Pisin equivalents, many of the words for birds are likely to endure long after many other parts
of the language have been forgotten.
On the rare occasions when the bird has a name in Tok Pisin, that is also
noted in the entry.

"5.3 Object (o) and subject (s/a) suffixes
5.3.1 Object suffixes
Before going on to discuss the range of TAM distinctions made in Tayap, it will
be useful to distinguish the various forms of the object and subject suffixes that,
together with the verb stems, encode TAM on a verb.
Taking the object suffixes first, note how their forms in irrealis are simply
the realis forms with an r inserted before the vowel in all cases except 1sg, which
retains the same form in both statuses. Interestingly, only the 3pl is distinguished
from the other non-singular suffixes in both paradigms:

Tayap’s subject (S/A) suffixes can be compared in Tables 5.2 and 5.3 below. Irrealis
subject suffixes only mark gender for singular subjects, and realis subject suffixes
do not mark gender at all. Both paradigms collapse second person non-singular,
they distinguish third person plural, and they collapse first and third person
dual. Note that these complex syncretisms are different in different paradigms
(see Section 3.5 for other pronoun paradigms, including the free pronouns and
benefactive suffixes).

For intransitive verbs, the irrealis subject markers are the same as those for transitive verbs. The realis subject markers vary depending on the group to which the
verb root belongs, and many are irregular. These subject markers are discussed
in Section 6.2.

"Commentary
The narrator of this story is an example of a young passive active speaker, a villager
who never speaks more than a few formulaic phases of Tayap. She speaks Tok Pisin
to everyone: her children, her husband, her old mother, her siblings, and even her
mother-in-law, with whom she interacts every day, and who is a Tayap-dominant
woman in her late fifties. Despite the fact that this young woman never speaks
Tayap, she not only possesses solid grammatical competence in the language; she
is also able to activate that competence to produce narratives of relatively great
complexity. She is the youngest villager able to do this; her husband, who is 6 years
older, was able to produce a coherent narrative only with her active intervention.
Gapuners would judge this narrative to be a good story in terms of structure,
content and performance. It adheres to the village narrative convention of having
the protagonist or protagonists go off into the rainforest, have something happenTayap Text 4: Young men kill a cassowary317there, and then return, at the end of the story, back to the village. It contains
detail and a variety of perspectives. It is dramatic.
Grammatically, the narrative is complex. It contains a number of different
verbs of motion besides ‘go’ and ‘come’ (lines 4–5, 16, 21, 22, 36), serial verbs (lines
13, 15, 23, 36) and clauses coordinated with the clause subordinating morpheme
-re (lines 26, 51). All verbs but one are correctly inflected for subject – this speaker
makes none of the errors that most other young speakers make, discussed
throughout the grammar. The one inflectional error she does make is tuptukro
‘they went first’ in line 7; but she corrects herself and produces the correct form a
few words later. Her pronunciation of the word, /tuptuko/, deviates a bit from the
more usual tɨptuko, but it is within the range of acceptable variation.
The only grammatical mistakes made by the speaker both occur with regard to
the gender of the snake. For most of the narrative, the snake is correctly gendered
masculine. But three times, in lines 29, 33, and 42, it becomes feminine (even if line
29 is ambiguous, because it isn’t entirely clear what the speaker is referring to).","[336, 337]"

the formally identical progressive marker also -rɨk (see Section 8.3.1.1).
The counterfactual affix -rɨk is optional in those cases where the form of
the verb stem in the counterfactual differs from its form in the irrealis. So, for
example, a verb like ‘be’ is realized as a in its irrealis form, but in the counterfactual, it becomes awk. This partially suppletive stem change makes the counterfactual morpheme -rɨk redundant. Therefore, it can be omitted. But it doesn’t
have to be omitted.
The phrase ‘she would have been’ can thus be expressed in any of the following four ways:
awk-rɨk-rak
awk-rɨk-tak
awk-rak
awk-tak
Transitive verbs display a similar range of variation. They can be formed in ways
that either include or exclude the following morphemes in parentheses. Note the
realis forms of the subject and object affixes:Adverbial subordinate clauses267+ object.r +

akrɨkkun
aknukun
akkunAs with intransitive verbs, all these options for variation only apply to verbs that
alter their stems in the counterfactual. They don’t apply to a verb like moser
‘buy’, for example, because that verb has the same stem form in both the irrealis
and the counterfactual (since moser isn’t a class 1, 2 or 3 verb; see the discussion
above about which verbs change their stem form in the counterfactual).3 In this
case, where the stem does not change to express the counterfactual, the counterfactual morpheme -rɨk is needed – even if the -nv/-tv subject morphemes are
optional.
So the full range of inflectional options listed above applies to verbs like o
‘hit’ or wawar-(p/w)-e ‘hang up’, because to express counterfactuality, those verb
stems change and become wak and wawarwek respectively. In those instances,
once again, the counterfactual affix -rɨk is redundant, since the stem change
already signals counterfactuality.
Negative counterfactual actions are expressed by simply negating the relevant subordinate verb as in a main clause, and following this with one of the
hypothetical particles (most commonly ndɨ), then expressing the main clause in
the counterfactual as usual:2 In the morphological combination -rɨknukun, the morpheme-medial n and u undergo metathesis, resulting in [ɾɵkunkun]
3 To lessen the risk for confusion, the verb stem of such verbs is glossed as cf in counterfactual
constructions, even though the stem is identical with its irr form. An example is (9-23).","[285, 286, 287]"
"5.5 Reduplication
The reduplication of verbs is another way of expressing temporality and epistemic stance (usually disapproval). The repetition or iteration of an action, for
example, is expressed by repeating the verb stem:

the verb happens over a length of time.

‘you (m) come and wank wank your way up the mountain’
(hollered by a woman in anger about a man she said always
cheated her. The meaning is something like ‘come and jerk yourself
off all the way up the mountain’)1605 Basic verb morphology5.5.1 Repeated action
There are a number of ways of showing an action is repeated. The following
example shows repetition, rather than reduplication strictly speaking, of a verb:
b. ŋgɨ amkwar ŋgwoka ŋgwoka ŋayi ŋgɨ orepemɨn
ŋgɨ am
-kwar ŋgwok

-mɨ
-n
1sg =erg.f 3pl leave.r -3pl.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
‘they were fighting for a long time and I (gender
unspecified) left them ’
In addition to simply repeating a verb to convey that an action or event occurred
several times or extended over a period of time, Tayap has a verbal suffix (-ítŋo)
that marks an action or event as occurring repeatedly and exaggeratedly over
a continuous, extended period of time. The meaning of this form corresponds
to the durative “igo” construction in Tok Pisin – e.g. “em i krai igo igo igo”; ‘he
cried and cried and cried’. The suffix only occurs on intransitive verbs and this
restricted usage may have limited the form’s transmission.
Speakers under forty understand the meaning of verbs that have the -ítŋo
suffix, but they never produce the forms themselves. In 2009, even speakers over
fifty had trouble thinking of examples. Perhaps the forms occurred mainly in
ritual narrative and singing or tuneful weeping over corpses – verbal skills that
for the most part have become moribund in Gapun.
In the 1980s, I recorded the suffix -ítŋo for verbs that were repeated over an
extended period of time, for example in the following verbs:
emrar-ítŋo
play.irr-xdporor-ítŋo
sing.irr-xdketuk-ítŋo
cough.irr-xdsimber-ítŋo
chew_betel_nut.irr-xdwarak-ítŋo
talk.irr-xd
I was also told that an alternative form that meant the same thing was the irrealis
verb stem + -ít- + ŋayar, which is an adverb meaning ‘really’. Senior men told me
that both forms below express the same meaning – perhaps because the first form
may be a contraction of the second:Reduplicationemrar-ítŋo or emrar-it
play.irr-xd
play.irr-xd?","[178, 179, 180, 181]"
"Intransitive verbs
Intransitive verbs are alphabetized according to their irrealis stem form + the irrealis ending (-ki, -kɨ or -ku) that affixes to the stem when it is negated.
If the verb stem itself changes between realis and irrealis, the stem change is
noted in parentheses after the main entry.
For example, the entry for ‘laugh’ looks like this:
irkɨ v.i. (pirot/ pirok), laugh; lap.
This entry should be read to mean the following:
(1) The irrealis form of this intransitive verb is irkɨ, consisting of the verb stem
ir + the irrealis suffix -kɨ. This is the form the verb takes when it is negated –
so one says irkɨ wákare ‘X (any subject) didn’t/won’t laugh’.
The irrealis suffix -kɨ is a morpheme separate from the verb stem, but it
is provided in the dictionary entry because, as discussed in Section 5.2.2 of
the Grammar, there is no way of knowing what the suffix is unless one hears
it (or sees it here).",[359]
"Young people’s Tayap19With this kind of danger in mind, whenever I wondered aloud in Gapun
whether I might be coming down with a cold or a fever, a villager was always on
hand to ruefully shake his or her head and remind me how foolish I was to put
myself at risk of bronchial collapse by sitting next to a woman who had recently
given birth. Sure, I might take special white-people’s medicine to protect against
the ravages of vaginal heat, they told me (this is how they assumed I could survive
the blasts at all), but sooner or later, they just knew, I would start spewing blood.
Despite their expectation that I would soon be coughing out my own lungs,
both women and men seemed to enjoy my visits in the maternity huts. Men
enjoyed them because I took digital photos of the new babies and willingly
showed them to them. Before I began doing this, no adult man had ever seen a
newborn, so they were all deeply curious. Women always welcomed me because
I brought gossip and stories. They also liked looking at the photos I took of them
and their babies. I usually also brought along some kerosene that could be put
into a tin lamp, thus sparing the new mother and her baby pitch-black nights in
a lonely, wind-rattled hut.
Because I spent so many hours in the company of young women in places
like maternity huts, and of young men in places like the rainforest when they
performed intimate and lengthy ministrations together, I came to see, over the
months, that none of these young people ever used Tayap at all. All conversations
between young people under twenty-five, in all situations, were in Tok Pisin.
Young people use Tayap words that are common in the villagers’ speech, and
that often don’t have Tok Pisin equivalents (for example, words for various birds
and plants in the forest). And they do sometimes use short formulaic phrases,
to provoke humor or to “hide talk” from any non-villager who might be in their
company or within earshot. But that is all.
Young people do not converse, narrate, gossip, argue, tell jokes, discuss
erotic experiences or do anything else at all in Tayap.
Once I understood this, I became better able to make sense of the mutual
recrimination that arises whenever the topic of language shift comes up in villagers’ conversations. Parents blame their children for not speaking Tayap. They say
in voices dripping with irony that their children have all turned white and therefore they only speak the language of white people – Tok Pisin. Young people,
when mocked in this way, snap back that it’s the parents’ own fault their children
don’t speak Tayap: if they had taught them Tayap, they would be able to speak it.
Young men and women also told me that they don’t speak Tayap because
they are ashamed. “They laugh at us”, said one twenty-one-year-old man, referring to villagers in their forties and older. “They’ll say ‘Oh, he’s someone raised
in some other village’. Or, ‘Oh! A whiteman child who doesn’t know the village
language’. They’ll make fun of us. So it’s hard to answer in the vernacular and we201 The Tayap language and its speakersget mixed up.” (“Ol i save lap long mipela, ol bai kirap tok, ‘Em wanpela mangi
bilong narapela hap ia’. O ‘Ye, waitman pikinini i no save long tok ples’. Na bai
ol i wokim pani gen. Em nau, hat long bekim long tok ples bai mipela paul ia.”)
I became curious to know if the young people’s lack of Tayap, and their shame
about speaking it, was due to the fact that they simply didn’t command it. So to
try to assess this, I began asking groups of friends, two to three at a time, to come
into my house at night to narrate stories in Tayap. Because I knew by that time
that young people didn’t speak Tayap to one another or anyone else, I expected
this task to be like pulling teeth.
Instead, to my great surprise, it was like slicing butter.
Not only were young villagers eager to narrate; all but the very youngest of
them were also able to narrate in Tayap. Many of the narratives were short, and
most of them were scaffolded by the narrator’s same-sex friends, who sat on the
floor with them and helped the teller remember what things were called and figure
out how verbs were inflected. But what emerged in the narrative sessions was that
all young people in the village have some active competence in the vernacular, and
some of them have excellent active competence – even though they never use it.
Those young people who exhibited the highest-level proficiency in their
Tayap narratives (defined as speakers who spoke relatively unhesitatingly, used
a variety of pronouns, verbal statuses and verbs of motion, and who had a broad
vocabulary) constitute a kind of speaker that has not been discussed in the literature on language death. They are not exactly “passive bilinguals”, because
they are capable of active production – in a few cases, of relatively advanced
active production (Tayap Text 3, narrated by a twenty-five-year-old woman, is an
example of just how advanced).
Nor are these young women and men quite the same as what the linguist
Nancy Dorian, in her work on language death in Scottish Gaelic communities,
once labeled “semi-speakers” (Dorian 1981). The young people of Gapun are
like the Gaelic semi-speakers that Dorian described in that they have perfect
passive competence and perfect communicative competence in the vernacular:
they understand everything said to them and they respond in culturally appropriate ways. But unlike Dorian’s semi-speakers (and also unlike the Australian
Dyirbal semi-speakers discussed in Schmidt 1985), young people in Gapun do not
use the vernacular in conversations with fluent speakers. On the contrary, with
the exception of lexical items and a few formulaic phrases like those mentioned
above, they never use it at all. The narratives I collected in 2009 are the only
times in their lives that the young people I recorded have ever told an entire story
in Tayap, and unless I return to Gapun and record some more, or unless some
miracle happens and the vernacular experiences a sudden renaissance, those
sessions in my house are likely the last time that anyone under twenty five will
ever even attempt to narrate an entire story in Tayap.","[38, 39, 40]"
