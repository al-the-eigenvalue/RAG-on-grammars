4.6TueSus-Cuasses
4.61orGENERALTHEACTIVEVERBREMARKSActive verbs (both non-causative and causative) fall into four
sub-classes: intransitive, transitive, impersonal, and transimpersonal. While none of these sub-classes makes use of any special
inflectional elements, each of them (except the transitive) is restricted in a different way as to which of the total number of inflectional elements it may use. Thus intransitives are inflected
only for pronominal subject while transitives normally undergo.
additional inflection for pronominal object.
Impersonals differ
from intransitives in that they may be inflected only for a third
person feminine pronominal subject. Transimpersonals are like
impersonals in inflection for subject but undergo further inflectionfor pronominal object.",[55]
"(4) Falling, indicated by a circumflex (‘), e.g., &u’&?7ki “Shoot!”
(5) Falling-rising, indicated by a circumflex plus an inverted
circumflex (~), e.g., hén “Yes.”
In case the ultimate vowel is u preceded by k or hk, the low and
rising melodies may be placed, if desired, on the penultimate
vowel, e.g., to’niku “the man,” la’hontdhku ‘very early’; in
this event the u is unvoiced.",[13]
"Example:?u’rigma’r?uwa'ni(7a:c) ‘‘He went back home, they say.”
(4) When the rising melody is used the ultima starts about a
perfect fourth or fifth lower than the last stressed syllable and
then slides quickly upward about a minor third. In all other respects (including the pitch of the last stressed syllable) the contour of this type of phrase is like that of one having the low melody. Example: lo’ta wiwa’ndn (16:h) ‘Do you want to run?”
(5) The falling-rising melody consists of a quick drop of a perfect fourth or so followed by a quick rise of a minor third. This
melody occurs only with the one monosyllabic word hén ‘‘Yes.”’

available material. Some of these are probably archaic and most
of them are of doubtful meaning.
(31) -we, prob. an archaic exhortative postf., occurring in two
identical examples, viz., sa’kunawé (224:f, 22B:f) which the informant translated as ‘‘Let’s eat!” If the first person dual is implied it should be sa’k?inawé and the form as dictated is apparentlyincorrect. In corroboration of this we find that Gatschet wrote the
form as sa’kinawe ! and, since he did not record glottal stops, we
may read his form as sa’k?inawe < sa'k?ina “we eat’? + -we.(82) -yo, of no certain meaning, occurring only in the word
?7’mayo (4A:ar, 4B:ap, 4B:aq, 4B:ar) with the meaning “‘It is I”
(< ?¢’ma, 1s pron., + -yo).
(33) -tan, some kind of subordinating postf. In the only two
instances of its occurrence it is translated once as ‘‘after’’ and once
as “while,” e.g., 2a’m?uhkitan (4a:p) “after he had gone” (< ?a’m?uhki “he had gone” + -tan); hi’htin, ?u'natan (4a:bd) “‘while
he lived there” (?u'natan < ?u’na “he lived” + -tan).
(84) An element -at (or possibly -hat, though apparently unrelated to no. 21) is used once with a verb form, viz., po’nihcét (30)
“when I looked” (< po’ni “I looked” + -héi + -at or -hat). It is
assumed that -hci may be the unapocopated form of -hé (no. 4
above) but it has not been possible to establish a meaning for -at
or -hat; note that po’nihé (< po’ni + -hé) would mean ‘“‘when I
looked.”
(35)In one case an element -?aha is used in a context whichdoes not require a negative (see no. 18). In this case it has seemed
appropriateto rendertheelementas‘“‘indeed,”’viz.,te’hé?ehé,?o’wand (13:y) “It is she, indeed, (that) I want.” (ti’héehe < ta’hi, 3FS8 pron., + -?aha). Though the same form could mean “‘it is
not she,” such a rendition would not fit the context.
9.37ORDEROF THEPOSTFIXESIn certain cases more than one postfix is attached to the same
word and in this event their order is fixed. Note the following
rules. The references are to 9.32, 9.33 and 9.34:
Rule 1. The quotative postfix -a’ni (no. 6) follows any other
postfix which is used with the same word, e.g.,

"46HAASTUNICA(3) Alternative non-fusional conditionals for all of the auxilj.
aries may be constructed by the addition of the conditional post.fix -k?2 (9.33, no. 13) to their semelfactive forms. Such alternative
forms are used just as often as the fusional forms; hence a form
like wi'yak?1 “if you go” (< wi'ya, 2ms smlf. of ?u’wa, + -k?4)
occurs just as frequently as its equivalent fusional form wz’y?a.
4.5TueINFLECTION4.514.511ActiveGENERALverb stemsOFACTIVEVERBSREMARKSfall into two maincategories,thenon-causative and the causative, each of which has its own specialcharacteristics of inflection. While there are a number of cases in
which it is not possible to make a distinction between the two
types of stems except on the formal level, the terminology ‘‘noncausative” vs. ‘‘causative”’ is based on the following circumstance: Any non-causative intransitive stem may be transitivizedbybeing transferredcategory.fromthenon-causativeto thecausativeThus, to mention only one of numerous examples, wefind that ha’pa has the function of an intransitive stem meaning.
“to stop, cease’ when it undergoes non-causative inflection but:assumes the function of a transitive stem meaning “‘to cause . . «:
to stop, cease’? when it undergoes causative inflection.
(Other:
instances in which a given stem may be inflected in both categories
with a similar difference in meaning are provided in 5.212.)
In contrast to those cases in which there is a clearcut semantic
distinction between the non-causative and causative categories, it
is foundthat somestemsare alwaysinflected in the causativecategory even though their meanings do not reflect the notion of
causativity.","[44, 45]"
"It will be noted that they begin in two consonants62HAASTUNICAwhereas active verb stems (including transimpersonals) invariably
begin in only one consonant. Moreover, the first consonant in
both cases is § and, as is shown later (5.32), probably represents
an archaic derivative prefix *-§(7)- which may have served the
function of converting active stems into static stems.
4.74NEGATIVEFORMSThe negative non-inchoative forms are built up by adding thenegative postfix -?aha (9.34, no. 18) to the positive forms, e.g.,
Piya’ §2ehé.","[60, 61]"
"54HAASTUNICAtional notion normally indicated by a non-causative auxiliary, the
latter auxiliary may follow the causative one, as in the examples
quoted above.
The paucity of examples of double periphrasis
seems to be caused by a certain reluctance on the part of the informant to use the process. Thus it turns out that causative stems
usually exhibit no difference between the immutable and the mu-table duratives (4.532). Since the mutable durative requires the
use of the habitual suffix, its occurrence with causative stems
would call for double periphrasis. But because of the informant’s
tendency to avoid the process an immutable durative is often
found where one would expect a mutable durative, as in pa’kan?una'ni (4B:d) “he was replying,’ used in place of the more
correct pa'kahk?u't?una’ni (4a:d). At other times the informant
tries to get around the situation by using an incorrect form involving the use of the habitual suffix and the complete omission of
any element indicative of causativity, e.g., ku’hpahk?u’rana'ni
(10:d) as against ku’hpan?u'rana'ni (4a:aj) ‘they were feathering (arrows),” and é0’luhk?una’ni (54:a) as against ¢o’lun?una'ni
(5a:b) “it was dripping (down).”’ It seems likely that both alternatives for each example are incorrectly used in place of forms in-volving double periphrasis, viz., *ku’hpahk?u'nt?urana’ni and
*(o'luhk?u’t?una’ni, respectively.
4.545 The following synopsis of 3mMs subjective forms shows
the principal differences in inflection between the non-causative
and causative categories. The prefix tzhk-, occurring with the causative examples, is the 3rs alienable pronominal prefix used asdirect object (4.56).

On the formal level both of these postfixes must be added to the
non-periphrastic semelfactive paradigms of non-causative verbs(4.521)or to the regularsemelfactiveparadigmsof causativeHANDBOOKOFAMERICANINDIANLANGUAGES55verbs (4.542, rule 1). However, on the functional level the element -aha is used to form what may be called the negative semelfactive paradigm of active verbs while the element -k?aha is usedto form what may be called the negative habitual paradigm of
active verbs. The following synopsis illustrates the difference between the positive and negative forms of these verbs.

"Thereis obviouslyParadigms.an historical connectionbetweenthe twoExcept in the case of the identical forms, the habitualendings are built up of an element -ka-, -k-, or -hk- followed by the48HAASTUNICAsemelfactive endings. This element is probably connected with
the habitual thematic suffix -hk- (discussed in 5.213). It appears
in the form -ka- before monosyllabic semelfactive endings other
than those beginning in ?, the form -ku (8ms) being contracted
< *-ka'wi. Before monosyllabic endings beginning in ? the element appears in the form -k- with the consequent loss of the ?,
Before disyllabic endings beginning in ?, the element appears inthe form -hk-, but before disyllabic endings beginning in other
consonants, the element does not appear at all; hence the identical
forms in the two paradigms. Since all of the disyllabic endings beginning in consonants other than ? begin in a continuant, the nonappearance of -hk- is to be ascribed to the regular phonomechanical rule providing for the syncopationof an hk groupbeforeacontinuant (2.253, 2.254).
4.523TheConditionalSetThe conditional endings may be appended to any non-causative
active verb stem to form its conditional paradigm. These endings
are based on the semelfactive endings in much the same way that
the conditional paradigms of auxiliary verbs are based on their
semelfactive paradigms (4.44). Note the following rules:
(1) With the exception of the 1s, 2mMs, and 2¥Fs forms, the conditional endings are formed by inserting the conditional infix -?-between the last consonant and vowel of the semelfactive endings,
e.g.,
-w?t, 3Ms cond. endg. (-w7, 3ms smlf. endg.)

non-fusional conditionals for the rest of the forms. These consistof the semelfactive endings plus the conditional postfix -&?: and
may be used in place of any of the fusional endings described under
the first two rules above. In contrast to what is true of the conditionals of auxiliary verbs, however, the fusional forms are usedmuch more widely than are the equivalent non-fusional forms.","[46, 47]"
"Du. and PI.-?u'nimaPl.-se’ma, -sem-st’nima, -sinThe same feminine form (-sz’nima or -sin) is used both as a dualand as a plural. Note also that the dual and plural suffixes are
related to the independent personal pronouns ?u’nema (3MD),
si’nima (never *sin; 38FD-P), and se’ma (never *sem; 3MP), respectively (see 4.221). The function of the suffixes is, however, quitedistinct from that of the pronouns.
The alternative forms -sin (for -si’nima, FD-P) and -sem (for
-se’ma, MP) are irregularly apocopated atonic forms. The alterna-tive forms -ku‘hu (for -ku, Ms) and -hét’hi (for -hct, FS), on the other
hand, seem to have a special implication (see 4.842).
Examples of these suffixes (exclusive of the forms -ku’hu and
-héa’ht) are as follows:
ta’Cohdku (58:c) the chief < ta’- + ha

"The form ?a’ranz(1s) is based on a related stem *?a’ra- plus the 1s ending -nz,
while the form ?a’ra (3¥Fs) is possibly this same stem minus affixes.
The forms he’ra (2¥s) and he’rana (2FD) are based on still another
related stem *-a’ra, the person and gender being indicated by the
appropriate pron. prefix. The du. sign‘is a suffixed -na (or, in the
case of the alternative metathesized forms, an infixed -na-). This
same du. element is also used by ?u’na (4.423) and ?u’wa (4.425).
The pl. form na’?ara (3M-F) is suppletive and is based on the act.verb stem na’ “‘to lie down” (regularly used outside of this paradigm) plus the bare stem *-?ara. The pl. form of ?u’na is analogous.

"If the verb of the clause of indirect discourse is negativized the

negative postfix which is used in still other ways, viz., with nonirchoative forms of static verbs (4.74) and with independent
personal pronouns, nouns, and adjectives when these are used as
predicative words. Moreover, when a predicative noun is modified
by an adjective or when a non-inchoative static verb or a predicative adjective is modified by a comparative, the element -?aha is
attached to the adjective or to the comparative, as the case may
require. F-amples:

(pa'n?oho'nt < pa’nu very, comp., + -?aha + -a’ni, modifying la’pu good, adj.)In addition, -?aha may be added to an active verb infinitive to
form a prohibitive with or without the further addition of the
imperative postfix -tan (no. 11, above), e.g.,
ta’la ki’Cuin, 2a'm?ché.

"50HAASTUNICAIn English translations it is sometimes difficult to render ade.
quately the subtle distinction between the two types of duratives,
Both may be rendered by the English present or past progressive,For example, a sentence like “‘the man is standing” requires the
Tunica immutable durative while a sentence like “the man ig
running” requires the Tunica mutable durative. However, the
immutable durative may also be rendered by the English simple
present or past, as in “the man stands, stood,’ or by such an ex-pression as ‘‘remains (or stays), remained (or stayed) doing . . .”
The mutable durative, on the other hand, is preferably rendered
by the present or past progressive.
Examples of immutable duratives:
te'tin, ho'n?ora'ni, ta’nahta ha'luht.(4a:aw) There was a pathgoing down under the bank; ho’n?ora'ni she lay in a goingdown position < ho’nu to go down + ?a’ra, 3rs smlf.,

(Repetitive examples are rare.)It should be noted that whether one uses ?u’ra or ?u’na in expressing the durative is largely a matter of idiom. However, it has
been possible to work out certain rules of positional classification
which govern the choice of auxiliary in a great many instances,
particularly with respect to such contrasts as that found in p2’tahk?ara’ni (18:b) ‘‘she was walking along” (employing 2u’ra1) as
against pi'tahk?una'ni (14a:r) “he was walking along” (employing ?u’na).","[48, 49]"

Objective inflection, in which both non-causative and
causative verbs are treated alike, is accomplished by means of the
alienable pronominal prefixes or the reciprocal prefix. Examples
of the use of the alienable pronominal prefixes @. 21) as objects of

"The ’teens are based on mz’éu sa’hku ‘‘one ten’ to which is added
an element -teya, presumably having some such meaning as
“plus.” This gives us mi’éu sa’hteya which must in its turn be
followed by another numeral defining the number of digits added.
Terms for “twenty plus .. .,” “thirty plus . . .,” and so on, are
formed in a similar manner, and these must also be followed by an-other numeral defining the number of digits added, e.g., m2’éu
94/liteya sa'hku “twenty-one”; mi’&u 2e’nihteya sa’hku “‘thirty-one.”’
5.93 The stem po’lun “hundred” is also used as a general
term for “measure”? and hence may also be interpreted ‘‘mile,
acre, etc.”’ in the appropriate context, e.g., po’lun ta’yihkin, ka’nako’nt. (13:aa) “He would step seven miles.”’ The term po’lunt?e “thousand” is < po’lun + -t?e, aug. suff., and hence means
“big hundred.” The term po'lunt?e ttha’yi ‘million’ means literally “big hundred (who is) old,” the word tiha’yi ‘‘she is old”’
being < t-, 3Fs pref., + -ha’yi “‘to be old.”’? The informant occasionally used the adjective ha’yi ‘‘old”’ in place of the form ézha’yt,
giving the alternative expression po’lunt?cha’yi “old big hundred.”
5.94 Before concluding the section on numerals certain other
words require mention: (1) Terms referring to given amounts ofmoney, e.g., di’su “dime,” te’skalahki “‘a bit,” and la’spit?e “a
dollar,’”’ are like numerals in that they must be followed by a numeral defining the number of dimes, bits, dollars involved. (2) The
postposition and adverb ti’ri& “in front of; ahead’’ is also used
with the meaning “‘first,’”’ in its adverbial, not its ordinal, sense.

1.1PHONOLOGYPHONETICSGENERALREMARKSBecause of sweeping external sandhi phenomena, the smallest
phonetic group of Tunica is the phrase, which may contain a single
word or several words. Phrases are always set off from other
phrases by pauses and are also characterized by special intonational or melodic features. On the other hand, words occurring
within the same phrase form a unit. They are not set off from
each other by pauses nor by any other special characteristics of aphonetic nature.
Every phrase, every word, and every syllable must begin in a
single consonant but may end in a vowel, a consonant, or a cluster
of two consonants. Hence vowels are never clustered and clusters
of more than three consonants do not occur. A phrase or a word
may have one or more stressed syllables but these are never consecutive.
1.2THePHONEMESAll of the unit phonemes, the syllabic phonemes, and the
phrasal phonemes are listed immediately below. Their discussion
is provided in sections 1.3 to 1.6 inclusive.","[11, 12]"

auxiliary ?u’na is used if a sitting position is implied in connection
with the activity involved.

"PHONOMECHANICS
2.1GENERALREMARKSOn the phonemic level the smallest phonetic group is the
phrase. On the phonomechanical (phonological) level, however,
it is possible to distinguish between the word and the phrase on

4.54THEINFLECTIONOFCAUSATIVEACTIVEVERBS4.541
The inflection of causative verb stems is normally periphrastic. Their semelfactive, habitual, and conditional paradigms
require the use of the causative auxiliary. Other types of periPhrastic inflection. (involving the use of the other auxiliaries) are
also possible with causative stems provided they are extended bymeans of the causative thematic suffix -n (5.212). The infinitive
form of a causative verb is likewise extended by -n or its variant
-nt. Note that the causative auxiliary and the causative suffix are
mutually exclusive although no causative verb form is correctlyInflected unless one or the other of these elements is employed.
In the following sections a causative stem is indicated by the
device illustrated in ?u’ki..c., which is to be read ?u’ki, causative
verb stem.
_4.542
The rules for the construction of the normal semelfactive, habitual, and conditional paradigms of causative verbs are
as follows:52HAASTUNICA(1) The semelfactive paradigm consists of a causative stem plus
the semelfactive forms of the causative auxiliary (4.426), e.g.,
Puhk?u'k?utahé (44:0) when he had put him (lit., caused him tosit) < ?uhk-, 3ms pref., + ?u’/ki..c. to cause . . . to sit
(hence, “‘to put, place, set .. .”) + -?u’ta, 3ms smlf.,+ -hé, subord. postf.
?uhpi hust’ntak?ahca (4B:ax) they would hide him (lit., cause
him to hide) < ?uhk- + pi’hu..c. to cause . . . to hide(bence, “to hide . . .”) + -st’nta, 3Fp-P smlf., + -k?ahéa,
fut. postf.","[49, 50, 51]"
"24HAASTUNICAwhen coming to stand before another stem or an auxiliary verb.
Such instances are, however, exceedingly rare and seem to be con-fined to careless or allegro speech, as in he’rpohk?una’ni (4a: aw)
“the watched,”’ based on the stems he’ra ‘“‘to watch” and po’ “to
look”’ ; ma’rhotutihé (48: d) ‘“‘when she finished clearing (the table),”’
based on ma’ru “to pick up” and ho’tu ‘“‘to finish”; s2’mhihki
‘“‘you (Fs) played,” based on 82’mz “‘to play.”
2.244
There are a few noun stems beginning in a continuant
which usually syncopate the vowel of their first syllable when they
are preceded by the articular prefix ta’-. This type of syncopationis undoubtedly archaic and occurs with a very limited number of
noun stems, most of which have alternative non-syncopated forms
which may be used in the same circumstances. However, the syncopated forms are usually preferred to the non-syncopated ones.
Note the following cases:
ta'rku the tree, stick, wood < ta’- + r(t)'hku tree, stick, wood ?
ta’hka the corn < ta’- + A(a)'hka cornta'luni the field < ta’- + h(a)'luni field
ta’l?ukini the village, town< ta’- + h(a)'l?ukinz village, townta’l?upisi the mud < ta’- + h(a)'l?upis? mud
ta’st?e the horse < ta’- + s(a)’t?e horseta’stohku the puppy < ta’- + s(a)/tohku puppyComposite noun stems having one of the above stems as their first
member may also appear in syncopated form after ta’-, e.g.,
ta'rkuya'honi the limb < ta’- + r(¢)’hkuya’honi limb
ta'rkuwo’hku the box < ta’- + r(¢)'hkuwo'hku box
ta’hkawi'
sta the sweet corn < ta’- + h(a)’hkawz'sta sweet cornta’hkapu’ri the mush < ta’- + h(a)’hkapu'ri mushNon-syncopated forms of all these words (i.e., forms like ta’rihku,
ta’hahku, etc.) also occur though very rarely. Note also that since
this type of syncope is archaic, most noun stems do not employ it
even though they may begin in a continuant, e.g., ta’hahéu “‘the
sand” < ta’- + ha’héu “sand.”
2.25CONSONANTICSYNCOPE2.251
Anh which would come to stand between a continuant
and a voiceless stop is dropped. Examples:
?inta’t?e our brother < ?7-n-, 1p pref., + -hta’t?e brother
?u'ruhtané when I whoop < ?u/ruhta’n(t) I whoop + -hé when
1 The latter are probably to be interpreted as reformations induced by the analogy of the large number of noun stems which have no syncopated forms.","[22, 23]"

"Another difference between the two types ofstems is found in the fact that whereas active verb stems must begin in one but only one consonant, static verb stems may begin in
a vowel, a single consonant, or two consonants.
Although static verb stems are limited in number (there being
in all not more than thirty of them in the available material), the60HAASTUNICAtypes of ideas they express deserve attention and may be briefly
summarized as follows:(1) an emotional state, e.g., -ya’ri ‘‘to be ashamed”’; -ya’8i “‘to
be angry”; -wa’na ‘“‘to want, wish, be willing’’; -sru’ka “‘to be
afraid, scared, frightened”’; -5?e’pa “‘to be happy, glad, pleased”’;
-he’kani “‘to be excited, distraught.”
(2) a physical state, e.g., -ya’hpa “‘to be hungry”; -p.’htuni
“to be intoxicated’’; -si’pi “‘to be cold, chilly (of an animate
only)’’; -sz’hu “to be dry, thirsty” ; -re’kani “‘to be tipsy, partiallyintoxicated”’; -3to’hku “‘to be tired, fatigued, lazy’’; -ha’yz ‘‘to be
old.”
(3) a mental state, e.g., -e’rusa “‘to know”’; -Spi'tu- (inchoative
only; 4.73) ‘“‘to forget.”
(4) possession, e.g., -e’hiini ‘‘to own, possess”’; -la’ka “‘to have’’;
-hk?a’ra “to have’’; -hk?a‘ha (suppletive neg. of -hk?a’ra) ‘“‘not to
have.”
(5) andoneunclassifiedstem-hk?a’?akimeaning‘‘to be re-maining, left, left over.”
It will be noted at once that a number of the stems which express
an emotional or a physical state resemble adjectives on the semantic level. On the inflectional level, however, they are quite distinct
from adjectives. Whereas static verb stems, as mentioned above,
must be inflected by means of the inalienable pronominal prefixes,
adjectives are never permitted to undergo this or any other type
of inflection (3.3). Note the following contrasting pair of examples:
ta’hct te’'yast. She is angry. (é’héi, indep. pers. pron., “she”;
tiya’ st “she is angry” < ti-, 3¥Fs inal. pref., + -ya’81, static

rendered as subjects in English translations (as above).
4.722 The stem -e’rusa “to know”’ forms its dual in an irregular manner. Unlike other static verb stems it has a special dual
stem -e’runasa formed from -e’rusa by the insertion of a dual infix
-na- between its second vowel and the following consonant. The
dual stem is used for the 1p-p, 2mp-P, 2FD-P, 3MD, and 3FD-P formsof its paradigm and the infix -n- belonging to the inalienable prefixes is then omitted, e.g., 2e’runasd ‘“‘we know” (< %%-, in place of
9j-n-, 1p-P pref., + -e’runasa). The simple stem -e’rusa, on the
other hand, is used for all of the singular forms and for the 3mp
form, e.g., ?0’rusa “he knows” (< ?u-, 3ms pref., + -e’rusa);
se'‘rusa ‘they know” (< si-, 3mp pref., + -e’rusa).
4.73INCHOATIVEFORMS4.731
Most static verbs may also have special inchoative
forms which contain not only an inalienable prefix but also a 3Frs
subjective element, i.e., either a 3Fs inflectional ending (normally
attached to active verb stems, 4.52) or the 3rs form of the auxiliary verb ?u’hki (4.421). The use of one of these 3rs forms adds an
inchoative significance to the static verb complex, e.g.,
?uya'hpatihé(421)whenhegothungry< ?u-,3ms_pref.,+ -yavhpa to be hungry + -t, 3Frs smlf. endg., + -hé,
subord. postf.
Puya’ Seke’ni. (4B:r) he got angry < ?u-.+ -ya’& to be angry

sinsto’hk?oke'nt.
(4a:ay) They got tired < si-n-, 3Fp-P pref.,
+ -sto’hku to be tired + ?a’ki + -a'ni4.732 Inasmuch as the inchoative forms of static verbs contain
an element which must be construed as the grammatical subject,
we have in this fact justification for our assumption that the inalienable pronominal prefixes function as grammatical objects
when used with static verbs (4.721). Attention should also be
called to the fact that the inchoative forms of static verbs are conStructed in a manner comparable to the construction of transimPersonal active verbs (4.66). The difference between the two types of verbs lies in the fact that whereas transimpersonal verbs can-hot be used without an expressed 3rs subject, most inchoativeStatic verb forms have
Which no expressedcorresponding non-inchoative forms ingrammaticalsubject is required.two static verb stems, -&ni’yu- “to get lonesome”However,and -Spi’tu- ‘toforget,” form exceptions to this rule. Although they may occur
