"Do not make questionnaires too long. Three pages of well-spaced questions was a
good length in my situation.
Put lots of empty space between questions so that it is clear when you are
transitioning from one to the next.
Make the utterances that you are asking about stand out visually using boldface
text or something similar.
Make it very clear where answers are expected. One way to do this is to draw a
blank line after every question to which you would like a response.
It is sometimes necessary to ask the same kinds of questions more than once in
different ways, especially if the answers are not clear at first. Even slightly
rephrasing a question can affect the answers you get.
It is often useful to elicit data in stages. The first round of questions might involve
asking for translations of utterances in the language of communication (French, in
this case). It might also involve constructing Siamou utterances and determining if
they are grammatical. Once you have a set of well-formed Siamou utterances, you
can construct contexts and find out if the utterances are felicitous in those
contexts, or even ask the consultant to supply contexts. Care must be taken with
this because grammatical utterances may be rejected as ill-formed initially if no
context is provided, but deemed acceptable with an appropriate context.",[29]

irregular verbs in Siamou). The Siamou imperfective also resembles other Kru imperfectives in
some ways: it is always marked in some way, it bears mid tone, it has segmental content, and it is
suffixal. However, while the Siamou imperfective is marked by a nasal consonant suffix on the
verb, the Kru imperfective is generally marked by a vowel, and sometimes the consonant /l/, and
it may be either a verbal suffix or a suffix on the subject, or both. Siamou is part of the group that
marks it on the verb. Irregular imperfective forms in Siamou show some similarities with the

"Ken:
Meredith:You wanna get together this evening?
I have to study.conversational implicature: No, we can not get together this evening because I'm busy.
In (15), Meredith does not directly answer the question. However, if she is co-operatively
participating in the conversation (14a), it may be assumed that what she is saying is relevant to
Ken's question (according to the maxim of relation). Without the implied meaning, this utterance
would violate principles of conversation and would not be an answer to the question (14b). Ken
should be able to work out the conversational implicature without too much difficulty (14c) (and
most likely without even thinking about the fact a conversational implicature was used).
Implicatures have a number of characteristics (Grice 1989). First of all, they are
cancellable (Grice 1989:39). This means that a speaker can state or imply that an implied
meaning does not hold, or the context itself can cause the implicature to be cancelled. For
example, in (15), above, Meredith has made the implicature that she is not able to get together
with Ken. She could cancel this implicature by adding a clause to her utterance: I have to study
[...] but I can do that after I get home. This cancels the implicature that she has refused his
invitation and creates another implicature which is that she is accepting his invitation.
Implicatures may also be non-detachable. This means that if a certain utterance in a certain
context has a certain implicature, it will be impossible (except perhaps in special circumstances)
to find a different way to say the same thing and not have that implicature. Thirdly, although
implicatures sometimes become conventionalized, usually they are not part of the literal
meaning of an utterance. Additionally, implicatures do not have the same truth conditions as
the literal content of the utterance they are associated with. The literal content may be true and
the implicature false. (For example, suppose a younger sister finds her older sister's sweater lying
on the sofa and takes it to wear for the day. When accused by her older sister of taking her
sweater, she might reply 'I don't even know where you keep your sweater.' This is literally true,
but it implicates that she did not take it, which is not true. Finally, conversational implicatures
are often indeterminate. This means that a given utterance may be supposed to have a variety of
implicatures, any one of which would satisfy the principles of communication, and it may be
difficult to determine exactly which one the speaker intends.
Often the lexical meaning of the utterance (e.g. I have to study) is taken to be the main
intended meaning of the utterance. However, speakers very frequently communicate ideas in an
276indirect way, and sometimes an unspoken meaning is more salient than the spoken one. The
main intended meaning of an utterance is often something more complex than simply a
development of the literal meaning of an utterance (Jaczsolt 2009, among others).
Using this idea, we can see that implicatures could easily be the main intended meaning
of an utterance even though they are not part of its literal meaning. I will argue that this is the
case for ín in Siamou: The meaning(s) that it conveys in various contexts are not necessarily part
of its literal meaning. For example, the utterance in (16) contains the morpheme ín. I argue in
this chapter that its literal meaning is past tense. However, in this case, it does not even appear to
be contributing past tense because the same utterance without ín would also be interpreted as
past (17). The most salient meaning of (16) is either the invitation to sit down, or the speaker's
willingness to move (depending on the context).

"7.5 Conclusion and Outstanding Questions
I have shown in this chapter how Siamou future expressions are composed. The priority future is
made up of a finiteness marker, ri, and a prospective aspect morpheme -a. The simple future has
this same suffix -a, and also contains the particle bè which is a modal, and which may encode
intention. The certain future contains the particle bè as well, and the near prospective aspect
suffix, -bɛ̂.
The following paragraphs discuss some questions or problems that were raised by the
information in this chapter.
In 7.3.1-7.3.3 I presented three tests to show that the Siamou futures are prospective
aspect: they have obligatory future interpretations, they occur in aspect position, and they are
compatible with past tense. However, it would be desirable to have more tests to differentiate
future tense from prospective aspect. Enç (1996) used sequence of tense effects to show that the
English future will was different from the past tense -ed. Sequence of tense data from Siamou is
complicated by the fact that ""past"" construals are often obtained in the absence of past tense. In
Siamou, it is aspect, not tense, that is (usually) obligatory in a finite clause. The relevant data is
shown in (63).",[388]

This work on Siamou tense and aspect has served to document previously unknown patterns and
reveal new puzzles to solve. Overall, we see that although superficially Siamou may look very
different from other languages, the kinds of tools we have developed based on other languages
are useful in the analysis of an unfamiliar tense/aspect system, and the distinctions we find in
other languages are found in Siamou as well. In the end, Siamou does not really look all that
different. In the ways that it is different, we can systematically say how it is different because of
the tools that have been developed. There are still many open questions, some of which might be
resolved by more data which would provide evidence to help us choose between different
options. I hope that this thesis has contributed to this growing literature on the typology of tense
and aspect and contributed to the understanding of the Siamou language in its own right.","[420, 421]"

The perfective (10a), the completive (10b), the stative (10c),177 the past imperfective (10d) and
past non-verbal predicates (10e) all have a past reference time, but only the first one contains the

Although this dissertation focused on aspect in main clauses, there is some interesting data that
contrasts perfective and imperfective aspect in subordinate clauses.
388The perfective and imperfective are contrastive in if/when-clauses referring to future
events. In (25a), the speaker is suggesting a mode of transportation to the addressee. The verb in
the subordinate clause (if/when you come) is in the imperfective. If the perfective form is used
the utterance becomes infelicitous (25b).

"5.6 Conclusion
The main purpose of this chapter was to show that the Siamou L tone verbal suffix is a perfective
aspect morpheme and that the Siamou M tone -n suffix is an imperfective aspect morpheme. This
means that they are part of Siamou's grammatical aspect paradigm. In order to accomplish this, I
needed to provide theoretical background on three syntactic categories: tense, grammatical
aspect, and lexical aspect. This is because these three categories interact in a myriad of ways,
often resulting in default readings that can make it difficult to determine the actual function of a
given morpheme.
These results raise questions about the nature of other verb classes in Siamou. Although I
did not specifically attempt to show that Siamou distinguishes accomplishments, achievements
and activities, the analysis of the perfective and imperfective seems to confirm the existence of
these classes. For example, the test for culmination entailments of perfective verbs serves to
distinguish activities, which do not have culmination entailments, from accomplishments and
achievements, which do have culmination entailments.
In the process of this analysis, an important discovery was made: Siamou does not (as far
as I can tell) have stative main verbs. Rather, Siamou has a number of strategies for expressing
stativity, including a class of inchoative verbs that occasionally have result state readings, but
which actually make the coming-to-be of a stative situation more salient than the stative situation
itself.
The findings of this chapter also call into question the existence of the factative effect in
other Kru languages. Perhaps further investigation would reveal that a better understanding of
Kru verb classes would do away with the need for a ""factative"" in these languages.",[289]

"6Elicitation was done either in the village of Tin or in the town of Orodara, both of which
are Siamou speaking areas, about 15 kilometres apart. Sessions were recorded in .wav files with
a Marantz PMD660 solid state recorder using two of three microphones (one for the linguist and
one for the consultant): an omni-directional mic, a hand-held cardioid mic, and a lapel mic. The
omni-directional mic, although lovely in theory, was much better at recording cicadas, roosters,
donkeys, and mopeds than Siamou utterances so it was phased out. I used the hand-held mic
(with a mic stand) while Solo used the lapel mic. The recordings were later transferred to a
Macbook laptop. All Siamou utterances, along with any related information, were entered into a
database using Toolbox (an SIL software program).
When I returned to Canada, I was able to continue with my research by conducting
elicitation through email questionnaires. This was a beneficial supplement to in-person elicitation
because some elements of the grammar which my ears had missed became more apparent. Email
elicitation requires different techniques than in-person elicitation. Since there is often a time lag
between the time questions are asked and the time responses are received, it is extra important to
make the questions as clear as possible. Depending on availability of internet, a
misunderstanding could take weeks to clear up. Some techniques that I learned through trial and

If a morpheme is already known to be a perfective, this test may also show indirectly that an utterance has a
(grammatical aspect) initial point because if it is perfective, it can not lack both initial and final points. However,
this is not very helpful because we are testing final points to determine if something is a perfective in the first place.

Note that Bar-el (2005) is looking at initial points that are given by lexical aspect (i.e. the situation type has a

alwaysTo summarize, Siamou has some properties consistent with SOV languages, including
SOV word order, complement-head ordering of lexical heads and some functional heads, and a
preference for suffixes over prefixes. It also has a few properties consistent with SVO languages,
including head-complement ordering of some functional heads, and modifiers that follow their
heads. See 3.2.2.1 for more discussion of SOV and SVO properties.
Kayne (1994) would lead us to predict that all of the above structures that are head-initial
are un-derived, and all the ones that are head-final are derived by leftward movement. In the next
section, I look for independent evidence of leftward movement in Siamou.
3.2.1.3 Is There Evidence for Leftward Movement in Siamou?
This section explores three situations where movement commonly occurs cross-linguistically:
wh-questions, relative clauses and the formation of passives. (See Adger 2003.) Although this is
not the same type of movement as the verb-raising in anti-symmetry, we might expect that if a
language uses movement as a common strategy, it would be more likely to use movement to
derive its surface SOV word order. It turns out that Siamou does not use movement as a strategy
in wh-questions (3.2.1.3.1) or relative clauses (3.2.1.3.2), but it does in passives (3.2.1.3.3).
3.2.1.3.1 Wh-movement in Siamou? No
In many languages, wh-words raise to a higher position, leaving behind a trace (28a). Siamou,
however, has wh-words in situ (28b). Raising is ungrammatical (28c). Instead, an utterance like
(28c), without the trace, has a different interpretation, since the subject and object have inverted.

"[NP my grandma's blanket]d.[the x: blanket (x) & my grandma designed the pattern for x][the x: N' (x) & R (x, NP1)]The question I seek to answer in the following pages is which analysis (accidental
homophony, polysemy, conversational implicature, or abstract meaning), or which combination
of these analyses, best explains the apparent multi-functionality of ín. In the next section (6.3), I
show that its primary meaning is past tense, and then in section 6.4 I show that its other
meanings can all be attributed to conversational implicature.6.3. ín Shifts Reference Time to Past
This chapter argues that ín is a past tense morpheme. However, there is no concensus on what
the relevant criteria are for determining this. Semantically, the only criterion for a morpheme to
be called past tense is that it serves to shift or restrict the reference time to the past (Reichenbach
1947, Klein 1994, Stowell 2007, among others). In that case, ín fits the (semantic) definition of
past tense, as I show below.
There are also syntactic criteria to determine what counts as a tense. These include
obligatoriness and paradigmatic contrast (Comrie 1995, Binnick 2012, Wiltschko 2014). Using
these criteria, ín is not a past tense because it is not obligatory (as shown in chapter 5). It is also
not in contrast with any other tense morpheme since Siamou does not have a present tense or a
future tense. Based on these two diagnostics, ín might be better diagnosed as an adverbial.
However, it does not fit the criteria for adverbs in Siamou. First of all, it does not have the same
distribution as adverbs (as shown in chapter 2). Secondly, it does not have the phonology of a
Siamou adverb. In Siamou, no adverbs are vowel-initial, and in fact almost no lexical
morphemes at all are vowel-initial (see Table 2.5). This information is summarized in Table 6.1
Using this data, it is not possible to determine whether ín is a tense or an adverb. If obligatoriness
and paradigmatic contrasts are the main criteria, then ín is an adverb. However, if so, it is a very
unusual Siamou adverb because of its distribution and phonology. For me, the most important
criterion for past tense is the semantic one, and when I argue that ín instantiates past tense, I am
arguing that it has a past reference time, and I recognize that this requires me to stipulate that it is
not obligatory and not in contrast with any other tense markers in th language.",[301]

asleep and finishing before she woke up)
Then, using only the Siamou phrases, I attempted to determine in what types of contexts these
phrases were felicitous. In particular, I tried to determine whether or not utterances with a
perfective verb were used for situations in which the event time was contained within the
reference time (i.e. a Kratzer-type (1998) perfective, or a sub-type of Klein's (1994) perfectives),
and whether or not utterances with an imperfective verb were used for events in which the
reference time was contained within the event time. Note that for (26b), a context in which the
man reads the whole book while his wife is asleep was accepted. This is consistent with it being
a perfective utterance. However, I was not able to determine the felicity status of a context in
which he began reading before she fell asleep and continued after she woke up.
For the most part I was not able to get consistent results for these utterances. Part of the
issue may be my method of asking questions. Since French is not my first language, there is
always the possibility of a misunderstanding based on my wording of questions. Another
confounding issue may be the fact that the Siamou translations of the French phrases reverse the
order of the main and subordinate clauses, so that the French phrase is literally She cooked tô
while I watched her and the Siamou phrase is literally The time at which she cooked tô, at that
time I was watching her. Therefore, in one language the perfective aspect-marked phrase she
cooked tô occurs in the main clause and in the other it occurs in the subordinate clause. The
examples in (28) above are of perfective-marked verbs in subordinate clauses. The examples in
(29) are the imperfective counterparts to the phrases in (28). Contextual information is not
available for these examples either.",[413]
"Since futurity is tied up with modality, this chapter contains a survey of the literature on
modality. This includes a discussion of the ingredients of modality: the modal base, the ordering
source and the modal force, as well as two ways that modal expressions can be classified:
Kratzer's (1991) and Portner's (2009). It also includes an overview of different ways that modals
can be underspecified in languages, and how modality interacts with futurity. I look at four
different ways of analyzing ""future modals"" in various languages. They have been analyzed as
pure modals, as a fusion (into a single morpheme) of modality and aspect, as a combination of
modality and aspect (using two or more morphemes), and as modals that are either aspectual or
non-aspectual. In Siamou, future expressions are best analyzed as a combination of prospective
aspect and modality, as evidenced by a number of diagnostics. The final part of this chapter is a
first pass at decomposing Siamou's future expressions to justify the tree in (15). This chapter is
the final body chapter of this thesis and it is the most speculative and the least conclusive. At the
end of this chapter there is a discussion of some outstanding questions and a set of extra data on
future expressions that was not included in the analysis, but which may be useful for further
work on this topic.",[37]

If Siamou perfective-marked verbs that have a present stative interpretation can be analyzed as a
result state entailment of inchoative verbs, this leads to the question of whether the present
stative readings in other Kru languages (or even other Niger-Congo languages) can be analyzed
the same way. It would be interesting to see if verbs that are interpreted as stative in these
languages ever have inchoative readings as well, and in what syntactic environments those
readings arise. It is possible that the analysis given here for Siamou would work in these
languages as well. Perhaps Kru languages actually have no stative verbs, but only inchoative
verbs that may have a result state interpretation (especially in the perfective). One piece of
evidence to support this hypothesis comes from Kouya, another Kru language. In Kouya the
perfective of the verb za is glossed as an inchoative ('redden'), but it has a stative interpretation,
either present or past (68) (Saunders 2009).",[288]

This dissertation makes reference to Matthewson's (2004) paper on semantic fieldwork
methodology, which advocates against the use of translations as evidence in semantic fieldwork.
Translations are seen as simply one clue among many. In my work, it is very important to use
contextualized utterances to make semantic claims about Siamou. For example, I use utterances
such as (39), repeated from 5.1.2.1, to claim that the Siamou perfective has a default past
interpretation. This example shows that yɛn 'yawn.PRFV' has a strong default past interpretation
and it is only compatible in a context that allows a past perfective reading. The utterance is
infelicitous in a past imperfective context as well as a present progressive and present habitual
context. This shows that Siamou perfectives as they are used in real-life, and not simply spoken
out-of-the-blue, are interpreted as past.

"Temporal Distance
--------------[(T0-1)]----------------[T0]
There are three main objections to this theory. First of all, the temporal scale differs fromthe other scales in that there is more than one direction that can be distant from the central point:
either the past or the future. If ín only marks distance, then it should be able to be used for future
events as well, which it is not. Secondly, if the meaning is so abstract that it does not specify the
scale, then we expect there to be other scales as well, such as locative, for example. The particle
ín shows no indication of being used to mark physical distance from the speaker.251 Thirdly, I
showed in (100), repeated as (113) below, that ín can mark past tense and doubt simultaneously.
This makes sense if doubt is a conversational implicature, but not if it is part of a more abstract
meaning.

"4.4.1.4 Perfective Aspect Combines with Past Tense
The final test to show that a morpheme is not past tense is whether or not it can combine with
past morphology. This test is stronger than the previous two. First of all, if other past
morphology exists in the language, the role of past tense marker may already be taken, which
means the morpheme in question is likely not past tense.141 Secondly, we would not expect the
past tense to be marked twice by two distinct morphemes in one utterance. If one morpheme is
already marking past, the other one is likely doing something else.
4.4.1.5 Perfective Aspect Does Not Combine with Imperfective
If a grammatical morpheme is a perfective aspect, it is expected that it can not combine with
imperfective morphology.142 Perfectives and imperfectives are expected to be in complementary
distribution because by definition, an utterance cannot have both perfective and imperfective
aspect.143141I am not saying that languages cannot have more than one past tense morpheme. Many Niger-Congo languages
make distinctions between different degrees of pastness, such as remote past and recent past (Nurse 2008). In the
absence of such a contrast, we only expect one past tense marker.
142
The past morpheme, in contrast, can co-occur with the imperfective, as I show in 4.6.2.4.

Sequence of tense readings need to be tested more rigorously, controlling for both tense marking
and aspect marking, and bearing in mind that ""past"" readings are not always the result of past
tense.
I proposed in this chapter that ri marks finiteness and bè marks intentional modality.
However, I have not pursued these claims. In order to determine whether ri actually marks
finiteness, I need to more thoroughly test its distribution in finite clauses. Its tendency to drop out
in casual speech makes it more difficult to analyze. For example, in non-verbal predicates, ri is
often absent. However, I do not know whether it is required in such clauses in careful speech, or367if it simply does not occur with certain non-verbal predicates. I also need to look at non-finite
predicates, such as those containing the non-finite particle ki, to contrast them with ri-clauses and
determine whether or not there is any overlap.
The analysis of the particle bè also left many questions unanswered. Is a unified analysis
of bè in all its contexts of use possible, or even desirable? I proposed that bè marks intentional
modality. However, it occurs in many future expressions that do not seem to be about intention.
It also occurs in some non-future expressions (for example, subordinate clauses and non-verbal
predicates) that are not about intention either.
I argued that the three future expressions all encode modality, and that the bè futures are
(at least sometimes) about intention, and the ri future is about non-intention, leading to a priority
modal reading. More tests need to be done to find out what kinds of modal bases and ordering
sources these future expressions are compatible with.
Finally, the prospective aspect 2 suffix, -bɛ̂ is not compatible without bè. That is, there is
no ri. . .-bɛ̂ future expression in Siamou. A complete analysis of these future expressions should
provide an explanation for this. One possibility is that if -bɛ̂ implies that a set of steps leading up
to the event is already in progress, perhaps this means that it has gone beyond a vague idea such
as desire or obligation, and the ""intentional"" reading provided by bè is obligatory.
I leave this work on futures for future work.","[389, 390]"
"1.3.7 Conclusion
Chapter 8 summarizes the findings of this thesis regarding tense and aspect, and it outlines the
main outstanding issues. In Siamou, some temporal interpretations arise by default: the
perfective has a default past interpretation and the imperfective has a default present
interpretation. Siamou future expressions have a prospective aspect component, and a modal15component, but they are not future tense according to the definition of tense used in this
dissertation. Siamou perfective aspect meets the criteria for perfective aspect as defined by Klein
(1994): it refers to situations in which the reference time is partially contained within the event
time. Siamou imperfective aspect meets the criteria for imperfective aspect as defined by both
Klein (1994) and Kratzer (1998): it refers to situations in which the reference time is completely
contained within the event time. Regarding lexical aspect, an important contribution of this
dissertation is the discovery that Siamou lacks stative verbs. Instead, there are a number of other
strategies for encoding stativity, including a class of verbs called inchoatives, which have a result
state implicature.
The main questions that remain are the following:

PRSP2-PRSP1The question that remains is whether or not the perfective or the imperfective can
combine with any of the other suffixes. Here I look at two cases of possible stacking: one with
the imperfective and one with the perfective. Unfortunately, I am not able to draw any definite
conclusions about whether this is actually stacking or not, although I suspect it is not. I simply
present what I know and leave the rest for future work.
The first case of possible stacking involves the imperfective. It is possible to manipulate
the Siamou verb stem in two ways in order to alter the meaning of the utterance. In (59), I show
one example of this changed verb stem using the verb kú (to die) with the prospective aspect 1
suffix, -a. In (59a), the verb stem is unaltered. In (59b), the tone of the verb stem has changed
(from high to high-mid), and a nasal consonant has been added to the right edge, and the
meaning of the utterance includes stronger certainty. In (59c), the tone has changed even more
drastically to become quite a long contour, and there is a nasal consonant at the right edge, as in
(59b). The utterance in (59c) has more semantic intensity than (59a-b).
101From what I can tell, perfective and imperfective can not stack with each other. However, I am not sure exactly
what this stacking would look like, since both of them are mainly suprasegmental. I tested forms that had ML tone
and a nasal coda, as well as forms that had a LM tone and a nasal coda. The former was hard to get accurate
judgements on because of the fact that many imperfectives are written as ML. The latter was never accepted.",[162]

The above examples show that ín can implicate doubt when it occurs with perfectivemarked verbs (101b, 104) and with stative-marked verbs (102, 103, 105). In (106), I show that it
is possible for ín to convey a sense of doubt even when it occurs in an environment where its
usual function is simply to mark past tense (i.e. with imperfective aspect). In this case it still
marks past tense, but it also conveys doubt, not about the eating, but about what happened after.
This supports analyzing the sense of doubt as an implicature. If doubt were a separate meaning
of ín we would expect it to either mark past tense or doubt, but not both.

From the above examples, it appears that the doubt is sometimes related to the truth of
the lexical meaning of the utterance, but not necessarily. It could also be about some implicature
in that utterance's context. For example, in (104), the dog actually did survive, but it is not
necessarily still alive. In (106), the doubt is not about the content of the utterance- whether the
person actually ate, but about what happened after.
Politeness and doubt both have to do with the speaker distancing him/herself from the
information that is given. It has been noted previously that past tense can serve to mark
politeness or doubt. Fleischman (1989) suggests that just like the past tense distances us from the
present, doubt distances us from reality, and politeness distances us from the situation in a way
that places less obligation on the listener. Either the speaker does not want to make claims that
they can not support (doubt), or they do not want to be pushy or rude (politeness). Botne and
Kerschner (2008) observe that the English past tense -ed can mark social distance or politeness
as in (107).

Siamou has four main particles that occur at the right edge: a past tense particle ín (see chapter

2.3.4.3.1 Past Tense ín
The first right-edge particle, ín, is a marker of past tense. I explore its semantics in
chapter 5. Here I look at its position in the clause. In simple finite clauses, ín only has one
possible position: at the right edge (99). In (99a) ín is both immediately after the verb, and clause
final. It cannot occur before the main verb in any position at all (99b-e).

important to pay attention to exactly how R and E overlap. In the diagrams in (25), the first and
third perfectives (25a,c) have an event time that begins inside the reference time. In other words,
the initial point of E is in R. The second and third perfectives (25b-c) have an event time that
ends inside the reference time. That is, the final point of E is in R. Since the reference time is a
time that is relevant in the discourse in some way, we expect the initial points of (25a,c) to be
relevant, and we expect the final points of (25b-c) to be relevant. Therefore, in order to
determine which perfective aspect a morpheme represents, we need to test whether or not the
initial and final points of E are inside R.
Testing the initial and final points of E is complicated by the fact that if an event
described by a perfective-marked utterance lacks an initial or final point, this may be due to
either lexical aspect or grammatical aspect. It may be difficult to tell which one, especially since
they are interdependent. For example, if a perfective-marked activity event has no final point
within the reference time, it may be because activities have no final points or it may be because
the perfective in question refers to an event that has no final point within the reference time. My
goal is not to untangle them, but simply to determine whether or not perfective aspect does
sometimes refer to events that lack either an initial point or a final point within the reference
time, as Klein (1994) predicts. (It can never lack both because that is an imperfective in both
Klein (1994) and Kratzer's (1998) definitions.)
Some data accords better with Klein's (1994) broader meaning approach to the perfective.
Allowing a perfective to lack a final point easily accounts for the inceptive reading that
perfectives may have with punctual adverbs in languages such as Skwxwú7mesh (Bar-el 2005)).
One potential problem with adopting Klein's perfective is a lack of solid evidence (besides the
vague intuitions of native English speakers such as that given in (16-17)) that perfectives can
lack initial points. However, this does not mean that such evidence does not exist. I have not
found any satisfactory test for initial points at all, so this is an area of research that needs
attention.
4.2.5 Conclusion
In this section, I have outlined my goals for establishing truth and felicity conditions for the
identification of perfective and imperfective aspect. I have described and contrasted two different185accounts of the contrast between perfective and imperfective aspect: one from Kratzer (1998)
and one from Klein (1994).","[206, 207, 208]"
