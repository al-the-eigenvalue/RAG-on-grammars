"19.2.1. Polar interrogatives
Polar interrogatives express questions that can be answered by ‘yes’ or ‘no’,
although other answers are possible as well, such as ‘maybe’ or ‘I don’t know’.
However, ‘no’ answers are not defining of polar questions in Toqabaqita, because questions asked by means of open interrogatives also can be answered
with ‘no’. It is ‘yes’ and ‘maybe’ answers that are unique to polar questions.
(See section 19.4 for answers to questions.)19.2 Closed interrogatives791The structure of polar interrogatives is no different from the structure of
(simple) declarative sentences. The only difference is in the intonation. While
in declaratives there is normally a fall in intonation towards the end of the sentence, in polar interrogatives there is a rise in intonation towards the end. The
sentence in (19-1) with falling intonation at the end is declarative, while structuraly identical (19-2) with a rise in intonation at the end is interrogative:
(19-1)Qe
qako
naqa.
3SG.NFUT be.cooked PRF
‘It [food] is cooked/done now.’(19-2)Qe
qako
naqa?
3SG.NFUT be.cooked PRF
‘Is it cooked/done now?’Polar interrogatives can be elliptical sentence fragments:
(19-3)Qa-muqa?
POSS-2SG.PERS‘Yours?’ (Asking about food.)
A polar interrogative may contain a topicalized, fronted element:
(19-4)Wela baa ki,
qo
riki-da?
2SG.NFUT see-3PL.OBJ
child that PL
‘The children, did you see them?’A polar interrogative can be joined with a non-interrogative clause in a complex sentence. In (19-5) the interrogative clause is coordinated with a declarative clause :
(19-5)Nau ku
lae naqa, ma ni
PRF and PROFORE
1SG 1SG.NFUT go
‘I am going now, and (how about) you?’kamuluqa?
2PLAnd in (19-6) the interrogative clause forms the apodosis of a conditional
sentence:
(19-6)Mada
orsa
IRRmika
fula
1PL(EXCL).SEQ arriveqi
LOCqusungadi,
tomorrow792Interrogativeska
leqa
ba-na?
3SG.SEQ be.good LIM-3SG.PERS
‘If we come tomorrow, will that be all right? (lit.: will that only be
good?)’ ‘If we came tomorrow, would that be good?’
Without any formal difference, positive polar interrogatives may express
neutral questions, where the speaker has no particular expectations about
whether the answer will be positive or negative, or they can express biased
questions, where the speaker has an expectation that the answer will be positive. The question expressed in (19-7) is neutral:
(19-7)Qo
riki-a
faela baa?
2SG.NFUT see-3.OBJ file that
‘Have you seen the file [a tool]?’On the other hand, the question expressed in (19-8) is biased. The question
is directed at a person who is getting ready to leave. The speaker expects the
answer to be positive and seeks confirmation:
(19-8)Qoki
lae naqa neri?
PRF NPAST.HERE
2SG.FUT go
‘Are you going now?’Sometimes the speaker is fully certain that the state of affairs is indeed such
and such and is seeking neither information nor confirmation. Rather a positive
polar interrogative serves a phatic communion function. Quite commonly, people when seeing that a state of affairs is such and such will use a polar interrogative as if they were inquiring about that state of affairs. Such interrogatives
typically serve as a way to initiate conversation or as a greeting. The sentence
in (19-9) was addressed to a man who was clearly making copra:
(19-9)Qo
kafara
2SG.NFUT make.copra
‘Are you making copra?’nena?
NPAST.THEREAnd the interrogative in (19-10) was addressed to a person who was passing
by on his way down (towards the coast) and was intended as a greeting:
(19-10)Qo
sifo
nena?
2SG.NFUT descend NPAST.THERE
‘Are you going down?’19.2 Closed interrogatives793Positive polar interrogatives are also used when the speaker is not seeking
information from the addressee because he/she does not expect the addressee to
have the information. Rather, the speaker is contemplating the possibility that
such and such may be the case or is wondering whether such and such might be
the case. Such interrogatives function to express a relatively high degree of
uncertainty on the part of the speaker about a state of affairs. They employ the
element mada ‘or’, which elsewhere functions as a conjunction and also to
introduce the protases of conditional sentences, and they may also contain the
particle toqo ‘perhaps’, ‘probably’, ‘possibly’ (section 18.5.1). In (19-11) toqo
is present:
(19-11)Mada
e
sifo
toqo?
or
3SG.NFUT descend perhaps
‘Did he perhaps go down [to the coast]?’For a pair of examples without toqo see (18-60a) and (18-60b) in section
18.5.3.
In contrast to positive polar interrogatives, negative polar interrogatives are
normally used to seek confirmation. A negative state of affairs is unexpected or
unusual, and the speaker wishes to have it confirmed that the situation is indeed
such and such. For example, on arriving at a household in the morning and not
seeing Ulufaalu (a man) around, the person surmises that Ulufaalu is still asleep
and asks:
(19-12)Ulufaalu
qe=aqi
si
tharaqi?
Ulufaalu
3SG.NFUT=NEGV 3SG.NEG be.awake
‘Ulufaalu is not awake?’By saying (19-13), the speaker expresses her surprise at not seeing Fiona
and the others around:
(19-13)Fiona kesi
fula
quu?
ANTCONT
Fiona
3PL.NEG arrive
‘Haven’t Fiona ’n them arrived yet?’19.2.2. Alternative interrogatives
Alternative interrogatives express questions that “provide a list from which, the
speaker suggests, the right answer might be drawn” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:
179). In Toqabaqita, the alternatives in such a list are joined by means of the
conjunction mada ‘or’ (sections 11.2.2 and 28.4). There is normally a fall in794Interrogativesintonation at the end of an alternative interrogative. The alternatives may be
clausal, where it is clauses that are joined by mada, or subclausal, where clause
constituents are joined rather than whole clauses. In the first example below the
alternatives are expressed in noun phrases:
(19-14)Qo
thathami-a alo mada kai?
yam
2SG.NFUT want-3.OBJ taro or
‘Do you want the taro or the yam?’As far as clausal alternatives are concerned, two main subtypes can be distinguished. In one, the clauses encode independent alternative propositions,
while in the other type the proposition of the second clause is a negation of the
proposition of the first clause. The subtype with independent alternatives is
illustrated in (19-15):
(19-15)Qo
raa mada
qoki
biinga
2SG.IPFV sleep
2SG.NFUT work or
‘Did you work or were you just asleep?’ba-muqa?
LIM-2SG.PERSIf the second alternative is a negation of the first one, that alternative is normally expressed only by means of the negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the
case’ (section 17.3):
(19-16)Faka ba=e
fula
ship that=3SG.NFUT arrive
‘Did the ship arrive or not?’mad=e
or=3SG.NFUTaqi?
not.be.soIf the second alternative is assumed by the speaker to be obvious, it need not
be expressed at all, but the conjunction mada ‘or’ is still present. In fact, it is
the presence of mada that implies the existence of an alternative.","[843, 844, 845, 846, 847]"
"Answers to questions19.4.1. Answers to polar questions
With respect to polar questions, Toqabaqita has an agree/disagree answer system, sometimes in combination with an echo system (Sadock and Zwicky
1985). A positive (agree) answer pro-sentence element is used when the polarity of the answer agrees with the polarity of the question, and a negative construction is used when the polarity of the answer disagrees with the polarity of
the question. In a pure echo system, “… no special answer words are used at
all. Simple positive and negative responses to questions involve repeating the
verb of the question, with or without additional material ....” (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985: 191). In Toqabaqita, pro-sentence answer elements are sometimes combined with echo answers; alternatively, an echo answer may occur by
itself, without a pro-sentence element.
There are four “agree” pro-sentence lexemes and one “disagree” type construction. For convenience, the agree lexemes are glossed ‘yes’ and the disagree
construction is glossed ‘no’, ‘(it is) not’, but these glosses do not fully correspond to the meanings of yes and no (because the English system is not of the
agree/disagree type). The gloss ‘yes’ will be in double quotes (“yes”) when the
agree elements occur in sentences that are answers to negative-polarity questions. The agree elements are listed in (19-149):
(19-149)agree pro-sentence lexemes: iu, aqaa, mania, uaqaOf these, iu and aqaa are most common, with iu somewhat more common
than aqaa, while uaqa is least common. (All four all also used to express acknowledgement with what somebody else is saying, and iu, aqaa and mania are
also used to link sentences; see examples [27-55] and [27-56] in section
27.3.2.)
The disagree construction consists of the negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be
the case’ (section 17.3) with the third person singular nonfuture subject marker.
The subject marker and the verb normally form one phonological word, with
the stress falling on the subject marker (section 2.5).",[882]

A: ‘Ulufaalu is not awake?’
B: ‘No (he is not awake).’
When a sentence that is a reply to a negative-polarity polar question contains an echo, the echo is grammatically negative, as is the question. The echo
is grammatically negative not because the answer is of the disagree type but
because it is an echo of a negative interrogative. A negative echo and an agree
pro-sentence element can cooccur, as in (19-163):

1SG 1SG.NEG be.hungry
A: ‘Are you not hungry?’
B: ‘(No,) I am not hungry.’
To express disagree-type replies to negative-polarity questions, only positive
echo-type answers are used. The disagree construction qe aqi is not used, with
or without an echo.

B: (After investigating.)‘(That was) a cat.’19.4.2. Answers to alternative questions
The default answer to an alternative question picks up one of the alternatives.
The interrogative sentence in (19-168) is a “complex” one (section 19.5), expressing a polar question (‘did you go?’) followed by an alternative one where
the second alternative is a negation of the first alternative (‘did you bring a
possum or not?’). The answer is an agree-type echo to the polar question and it
picks the negative alternative:

It is, of course, possible for the person to whom an alternative question is
addressed to not know the answer or to not be certain about what the relevant
state of affairs is:

Here the expected answer relates to the interrogative phrase. Positive responses
are discussed and illustrated first. The response may be a complete sentence or
a fragment. In (19-170) the response is a complete sentence:

A minimal negative response to an open question is expressed by means of
the negative verb aqi ‘not exist’ with the third person singular nonfuture subject
marker. Quite commonly, the assertive particle boqo is present as well.

Sentences that express agree-type and disagree-type answers can contain, in
addition to the pro-sentence elements or in addition to the negative construction, echoes of the interrogatives, with the appropriate adjustments in pronouns
and other deictic elements, and possibly with some additional material.

Replies to negative-polarity polar questions are discussed next. In sentences
that are replies to negative-polarity questions, echoing of the interrogative is
more common than in sentences that are replies to positive-polarity questions,
especially when the reply is of the disagree type. When the reply is of the agree
type, an agree element may occur by itself, or an echo may occur by itself, or an
agree element and an echo may be combined. In (19-162) only an agree lexeme
is used.",[885]

That is, the same negative construction can be used to express a disagreetype answer to an open question and as a negative answer to a polar question.
The only difference is that in responses to polar questions the negative verb has
the sense ‘not be so, not be the case’, while in responses to open questions the
negative verb has the negative existential sense ‘not exist’. (Negative existential
sentences are discussed 26.1.2.2.) The fact that in responses to open questions
the negative verb functions as an existential one can be seen from (19-175a),
where the verb occurs in the predicate position of a negative existential sentence with an overt subject phrase. In (19-175b) only the verb occurs with the
subject marker and the assertive marker:
(19-175)a.","[889, 890]"
"Complex interrogativesThe term “complex interrogatives” is used here to refer to cases where two
different types of interrogative are combined in some way, by juxtaposition of
sentences, or by coordination or embedding of clauses. In such cases normally
only one of the interrogatives expresses a true question, that is a question to
which an answer is being sought.
One type of complex interrogative consists of an open interrogative sentence
with the intransitive interrogative verb qufita ‘be how?’, ‘do what?’, ‘do how?’
(section 19.3.5), followed by a closed interrogative sentence. It is the closed
interrogative that expresses the question to which an answer is requested. The
qufita interrogative merely serves to introduce the closed interrogative. It consists of the verb qufita and its subject marker, which is the third person singular
nonfuture one, qe:
(19-178)Qe

or19.5 Complex interrogatives839koki
too ba-karoqa?
DU(INCL).FUT stay LIM-DU(INCL).PERS
‘So (how)? Shall we go or shall we (just) stay?’
A complex interrogative structure may consist of what otherwise would be
an open interrogative followed by a fragment of an alternative interrogative that
narrows down the options of the former, and the answer is expected to be selected from that set:
(19-179)Tei na

‘Which of these two spoons is yours? This one or that one?’ (Lit.:
‘Which spoon of these two things is your spoon? This thing or that
thing?’)
And a complex interrogative may consist of a dependent interrogative (section 19.6) that is the complement of a higher verb, also in an interrogative
clause. In (19-181) the complement interrogative is of the closed, alternative
type, and in (19-182) of the open type. The complex interrogatives express
polar questions.

"IntroductionToqabaqita has two basic interrogative sentence types: (a) closed interrogatives
and (b) open interrogatives. The closed-open distinction has been adopted here
from Huddleston (1994: 419): “[c]losed and open interrogatives are characteristically used to express questions where the set of answers is respectively closed
and open”. In Toqabaqita, there are subtypes of interrogatives within both the
closed and the open categories. Also following Huddleston (1994), the term
“interrogative” is used here to designate certain sentence types, whereas the
term “question” is used to designate the central illocutionary force of interrogative sentences, which is to ask for information. In parallel to closed and open
interrogatives (and their subtypes), one can distinguish closed and open questions (and their subtypes). Although interrogatives are used primarily to ask for
information, they have other functions as well, such as asking for confirmation
or in phatic communion. Different subtypes of interrogatives may be combined
in “complex interrogatives”. And there are also dependent interrogatives that
are complement clauses.",[843]

And, of course, the addressee may not know the answer to an open question:

B: ‘Who knows.’ ‘I don’t know.’19.5.","[890, 891]"
"Emphatic open interrogativesWith some exceptions, open questions can be made more emphatic, more insistent by means of one of several intensifying particles, qana, feteqi, or boqo.
These particles occur inside the interrogative phrases. All three particles can
occur in interrogative noun phrases; qana can also occur in an adverb phrase
with fei ‘where?’. All three particles also occur in phrases other than interrogative. For their positions in noun phrases see table 7.1 in section 7.1. The particles may be joined to the head interrogative word by means of the ligature ni,
although this is not very common.
In emphatic questions with any of these particles, the interrogative phrase is
always in the focus position. Since the interrogative verbs qufita ‘be how?’, ‘do
what?’, ‘do how?’ and qufita-a ‘do what? to/with (st.)’, ‘do st. how?’ cannot be
fronted (section 19.3.5), the emphatic particles are not available with them. Nor
are they used in the inverted [verb.phrase subject] structure (sections 19.3.7
and 19.3.8), because the verb phrase is not in focus.
The three particles may serve to highlight the kind of information requested;
to insist on an accurate, detailed or elaborate answer; to emphatically demand
an answer; or more generally to express some kind of emotional involvement
on the part of the speaker.
Of the three particles, qana is the most common one in interrogatives. Four
examples follow.

In (5-113) boqo occurs twice in B’s speech, in a negative clause and in a
positive clause. In the first, negative clause, boqo has the whole clause in its
scope. (For negative answers to open questions see section 19.4.3.)

"Emphatic negationIn Toqabaqita, predicate negation can be made stronger, more emphatic in one
of several ways. The double negative construction can, but need not, carry relatively light emphatic force; see (17-33a) and (17-33b) in the preceding section.
Commonly, negation is (further) strengthened by means of the postverbal assertive/intensifying particle boqo (section 5.2.8). In (17-42) boqo is used in a simple negative construction, in (17-43) in a double negative construction, and in
(17-44) with aqi, which functions as a lexical verb there:748Negation(17-42)Kwasi riki-a.

B: ‘Nothing (at all).’ (‘There is nothing [that I want].’)
(For negative answers to open questions see section 19.4.3.)
Negation using the verb aqi as a lexical verb ‘not be so, not be the case’,
‘not exist’, ‘not be available’ can be made more emphatic by means of the perfect marker/intensifier naqa (sections 5.2.12 and 15.3). This strategy is not
available to the simple or the double negative constructions. Sometimes, naqa
does mark the perfect with aqi:

‘The sore that I had (lit.: that afflicted me) is no more! The sore has

However, frequently some degree of emphasis is present in addition to the
perfect:

‘I used to be rich (lit.: I used to see things), (but) this time no

But it is possible for naqa to express strong negation, without any sense of
the perfect. The three expressions in (17-47) can all function as answers to polar interrogatives. The one in (a) is neutral, the one in (b) relatively emphatic,
and the one in (c) highly emphatic:
(17-47)a.","[800, 801, 802]"
"Qana intensifierThe intensifier qana is used primarily in interrogative noun phrases in open
interrogatives. Its function is to make a question more emphatic, more insistent,
to request a more accurate, detailed, elaborate answer. Emphatic open inter-7.11 Mai ventive; kau andative371rogatives are discussed further in section 19.3.11, and here only one example is

grammatical marker of negation (see section 17.4).

‘I’ll come and see you again next Sunday, without fail (lit.: it will

The lexical verb aqi is used in a bi-clausal construction to signal that a potential situation will/should not obtain because of some disabling conditions
(section 17.6). It is also used in negative counterparts of grammatically positive
verbless sentences, and to negate fragments of clauses from which the verb
complex has been omitted; see section 27.2.5.
Occasionally, although only relatively rarely, the final vowel of aqi is realized as [']. This may happen when the third person singular nonfuture subject
marker qe and aqi fuse together as one phonological word, in particular as a
negative answer to a question: [!'pa!'] ‘No’. (For fusion of qe and aqi see further below in the next section.)17.4.","[793, 794]"

And they can also provide a loose link between the clause or sentence they

linking function may also be performed by the form neri, which elsewhere
functions as a situational demonstrative adverb ‘nonpast here’ (section 13.7).

The focus marker is sometimes absent when the interrogative phrase contains the perfect marker naqa; see (19-114) in section 19.3.6. This is also the
case in non-interrogative clauses (section 39.2).
The two options — fronting with focusing and no fronting — do not exist
for all types of open interrogatives. When they do, the type with the interrogative phrase in in situ sometimes, but by no means always, expresses an echo
question in reaction to more or less immediately preceding linguistic context.
This type of question may be used when a person did not hear well part of what
has just been said and wants to have it repeated or elaborated upon. By using
the interrogative in (19-25) the person is asking his interlocutor to repeat who
he had spoken to, because he did not hear well what the interlocutor said:

"IntroductionCoordination of clauses can be syndetic or asyndetic. Three sets of coordinating
conjunctions can be distinguished in Toqabaqita on the basis of their functions:
conjunctive ma, bii, and bia, with some functional extensions in the case of ma;
disjunctive mada; and sui, sui mena and sui taa, whose core functions are to
express contrast and unexpectedness.
When clauses are coordinated in any way, there is often a rise in intonation
at the end of each non-final clause and there may be a slight pause before the
next clause, and there is a fall in intonation at the end of the final clause, unless
that clause is a polar question, in which case there is a rise in intonation at the
end (section 19.2.1). Rise in intonation and pauses between clauses are indicated by commas.
Prosodically, the coordinators belong to the material to their right. The conjunctions occur clause and sentence initially, except that they may be preceded
by an interjection or by an element that functions as a loose linker between that
sentence and the preceding discourse (‘OK, ‘right, ‘all right’; see examples (2821) and (28-22) in section 28.2.2.
Syndetic coordination is discussed first; asyndetic coordination is discussed
in section 28.5
Besides clausal coordination, linking of sentences is also discussed in this
chapter.",[1005]

Presentational identificational sentences serve “to make the identity of a referent known to the hearer. ... [they] provide an object, or a class of objects, with a
‘name’, which may from now on be used by the hearer in referring to it.” (Stassen 1997: 2001).
There are two subtypes of presentational identificational sentences in Toqabaqita. Both are also discussed and illustrated in the chapter on demonstratives
and demonstrative adverbs (chapter 13), and here they are mentioned only
briefly. In one subtype the predicate is an adverb phrase that consists of a presentative locative demonstrative adverb (section 13.6.2). This type of construction is used when the entity in question is visible and can be pointed at or
pointed out.

excrement-ASSOC pig
‘(Watch out), that’s pig shit (where you are)!’ (Lit.: ‘Pig excrement
there, by you.’)27.2 Major verbless sentence types937In the other subtype of presentational identificational sentences the predicate
phrase consists of a reiterative demonstrative pronominal (section 13.8). This
type of construction is used to re-identify, relatively emphatically, a participant.

Ascriptive sentences, unlike identificational sentences, do not express identity
of reference of two phrases. Rather, the predicate characterizes the referent or
the type of referent of the subject in some way. Most often, the predicate is a
noun phrase, but it may be a prepositional phrase. The subject noun phrase may
be referential (which is the usual case) or generic. The referent or the type of
referent of the subject may be characterized in a variety of ways, some of which
are exemplified below. (The distinctions between some of the categories are not
always clear-cut.) In the first two examples the subject and the predicate noun
phrases are in square brackets.

go-NMLZ that LOC when?
‘When is the time to go?’ (Lit.: ‘The going [discussed earlier] [is]

the predicate characterizes the type of referent of the subject in terms of its
function:

‘The (leaflets of the) qulu bala fern are a thing for performing the
goo cure for people’s eyes.’ (Vapours from heated leaves or leaflets
of certain plants are used to treat conjunctivitis.)
The sentences in (27-24) and (27-25) are traditional sayings. The predicates
express, metaphorically, (perceived) qualities, characteristics.
(27-24)Wane nga

‘A man is (like) a dancing stick.’ (A man may be old, but all he

woman IDENT new.leaf-3.PERS plant.sp.
‘A woman is (like) a new leaf of an otoota plant.’ (Intended meaning: A woman looks good, fresh only when young.)940Verbless sentencesA predicate noun phrase may contain a relative clause whose subject marker
agrees with the subject of the ascriptive sentence. (See section 30.6 for discussion and more examples.)

see (27-27) and (27-28):

(27-28)Fita

seleni na redio naqi?

‘How much money is this radio?’27.2.4. Absence of subjects in the major verbless sentence types
It is possible for a verbless sentences not to have a subject; only the predicate is
present. This is true both of the identificational and of the ascriptive sentence
types. However, subjects cannot be absent when the predicate consists of a
presentative locative demonstrative adverb or of a reiterative demonstrative
pronominal.
In most cases the subject is absent when the referent is recoverable from
context, linguistic or extra-linguistic. Identificational sentences are frequently
subjectless because the intended referent is obvious from the extra-linguistic
context (and usually can even be pointed at). In the situation expressed in (2729), person A, on seeing a bird, uses a subjectless verbless question and person
B responds with a subjectless verbless answer. In both sentences the predicates
contain the situational demonstrative adverb neri.","[988, 989, 990, 991, 992, 993]"

Primary stress is indicated with “ p”, and secondary stress with “ y”. Here are

3SG.NFUT not.be.so ASRT

syllables is deleted, whether word-internally or across word boundaries when
two words become one phonetic word (section 2.2.1):

‘young, single man’[wayndapra:a]The presence of a monosyllabic suffix may result in the addition of stress to
the base. This happens when the base has two final unstressed syllables as an
independent word, and the addition of the suffix would result in three unstressed syllables next to each other. For example:
(2-40)a./77s+/ [7p:7s+]
‘buy’and/77s+-a/

not affect the stress:22Phonology(2-41)a./la'/ [lap']

see-3PL.OBJ
‘see them’The addition of a disyllabic suffix never results in a change in the stress
pattern of the base, because the first vowel of the suffix receives stress. However, the base will have secondary, rather than primary, stress. For example, the
nominalizing suffix /-laa/ is disyllabic, and it does not effect changes in the
stress patterns of the stems to which it is added:
(2-42)/la'/ [lap']
‘go’and/la'-laa/
go-NMLZ
‘going’[lay'lapa:]Compare the suffix /-laa/, which derives (action) nominalizations, and the
suffix /-a/, which derives deverbal nouns, in (2-43). The former does not result
in an additional stress in the base, while the latter does:
(2-43)/77s+/ [7p:7s+]
‘buy’and/77s+-laa/
buy-NMLZ
‘buying’[7y:7s+lpa:]and/77s+-a/
buy-DVN
‘market’[7y:7s+p]The suffix that derives nominalizations has the form /-laa/ when word-final.
It has the monosyllabic form /-la/ when it is followed by an inflectional personal suffix. In the latter case, the nominalizing suffix is stressed because of the
presence of the personal suffix:

There is also some variability among speakers as to how readily they accept
nominalizations of intransitive verbs in the bare construction. For example,
while the suffixing construction in (9-47a) is fully acceptable, the corresponding bare construction is not always acceptable. And to the extent that it is acceptable, its range of meaning is narrower than that of the suffixing construction:
(9-47)a.ngata-la-da
speak-NMLZ-3PL.PERS
‘their speaking’ (for example, what they said, the way they
speak, their language)b.ngata-laa kera
speak-NMLZ 3PL
‘their language’The suffixing construction is not used if there is a related bare Class 1 transitive verb of the same form, because with nominalizations of such transitive
verbs the personal suffix can only index the argument that corresponds to the
direct object of the source verb. For example, there is an intransitive verb luqu
‘answer, respond’, and a bare transitive verb luqu ‘answer (somebody, question,
letter, etc.), respond to’; see (9-48) and (9-49) below, respectively. The nominalization of the intransitive verb occurs in the bare possessive construction;
the possessor corresponds to the subject. On the other hand, the nominalization
of the transitive verb occurs in the suffixing construction; the possessor corresponds to the direct object.

and of the bare types of possessive construction, but with some additional differences. Furthermore, there are differences between nominalizations of Class 1
and Class 2 transitive verbs. Nominalizations of Class 1 verbs are discussed
first.
With nominalizations of Class 1 transitive verbs in the suffixing construction, the possessor corresponds to the direct object of the source verb.

When a nominalization of a Class 1 transitive verb occurs in the bare type of
possessive construction, the possessor corresponds to the subject of the source
verb. The argument that corresponds to the direct object is expressed in a
prepositional phrase that modifies the nominalization. The prepositional phrase
is headed by the general preposition qana.

in the suffixing possessive construction and the possessor corresponds to the
direct object:
(9-54)fasi-la-na
baqu
plant-NMLZ-3.PERS banana
‘planting of bananas’Similarly in (9-55) the argument that corresponds to the direct object of riki
‘look at’ is expressed in a prepositional phrase that modifies the nominalization:

‘This sewing machine looks very good to me.’ (Lit.: ‘My looking-at
of this sewing machine is very good.’)
Nominalizations of Class 2 transitive verbs were discussed in detail in section 9.1.1. They carry an object suffix that indexes the argument that corresponds to the direct object of the source verb. They can occur in the possessum
position of the bare type of possessive construction, where the possessor corresponds to the subject of the source verb. However, in that case the argument
that corresponds to the direct object can only be expressed by an object suffix
on the nominalization. The argument cannot be additionally expressed by a
noun phrase. In (9-56) wane qeri ‘the/that man’ corresponds to the subject.
There can be no phrasal expression of the direct-object argument. (The noun
‘father’ functions as a modifier of the nominalization to express a great degree;
see section 6.11.)

The various types of construction in which nominalizations can occur as the
heads of possessum phrases are summarized in table 9.1.
Table 9.1. Nominalizations in the possessum positionNominalizations based on intransitive verbs
In the suffixing construction (the usual case) or, in some cases, in the bare construction;
the possessor always corresponds to the subject of the source verb.
Nominalizations based on transitive verbs:
A.
When only one argument of the source verb is expressed:
Class 1 transitive verbs: in the suffixing construction; the possessor corresponds
to the direct object of the source verb. Class 2 transitive verbs: an object suffix
indexes the direct-object argument; the direct object may, in addition, be expressed by a lexical noun phrase.
B.
When two arguments of the source verb are expressed:
In the bare construction; the possessor corresponds to the subject. Class 1 transitive verbs: the direct object is expressed as a prepositional-phrase modifier of the
nominalization. Class 2 transitive verbs: an object suffix indexes the direct-object
argument; the direct object cannot be additionally expressed by a noun phrase.","[462, 463, 464, 465, 466]"
"Echo questions are also used because of the unexpectedness of what has just
been said, and the hearer wants to have it confirmed. In such cases the interrogative word is usually uttered with greater-than-normal intensity, including a
sharp rise in intonation. This is indicated by bolding in the next example.

Interrogatives with interrogative phrases in focus tend to be used, although
not exclusively, when there is no immediately preceding linguistic context that
demands repetition, confirmation, or elaboration. For example, when seeing
somebody eat something, one could ask the question in (19-27):798Interrogatives(19-27)Taa
n=o
qani-a?
eat-3SG.OBJ
what? FOC=2SG.NFUT
‘What are you eating?’ ‘What is it you are eating?’However, the distinction between open interrogatives with the interrogative
phrase in situ and those with fronted interrogative phrases in terms of their use
is not categorical. For example, interrogatives with fronted interrogative
phrases can also be used to ask for repetition, elaboration, or confirmation. In
(19-28) the speaker is asking for repetition, elaboration after not hearing well
what piece of the other person’s property had been damaged:
(19-28)Taa
qoe na
kera
laba-tani-a?
what? 2SG FOC 3PL.NFUT damage-TR-3SG.OBJ
‘What of yours did they damage?’Both types of interrogative, with and without fronting, can be used in response to very much the same extra-linguistic context. For example, when seeing somebody look for something, either type is possible and common:
(19-29)Taa
n=o

what? FOC=2SG.NFUT
‘What are you looking for?’(19-30)Kera
rofe-a
taa?
3PL.NFUT look.for-3.OBJ what?
‘What are they looking for?’However, there are syntactic environments where the interrogative phrase
must be fronted. This is true of interrogative phrases that correspond to the
subject of the sentence, although with one type of exception. Thus, where (1931a) with a fronted and focused tei ‘who?’ interrogative phrase is grammatical,
(19-31b) without fronting/focusing is not:
(19-31)a.b.","[850, 851]"
"The sentences in (19-126) – (19-129) express questions about locative goals.
With some verbs, either the locative or the allative preposition is possible in the
interrogative phrase. For example:

the cause or reason of an event, not about the purpose. While it is not always
possible to clearly distinguish cause/reason from purpose, all the available examples with a fronted prepositional phrase are either clearly queries about reason/cause, or at least are interpretable as such. Since the taa complement is
adjacent to the preposition, the preposition may have the full form uri-a, with
the object-indexing suffix, or the reduced form ura, as in (19-80) and (19-81),

GENP foodFronted cause/reason interrogative prepositional phrases exhibit several
properties that make them different from the other constructions with the
cause/reason and purpose preposition and from other types of fronted interrogative phrases. First, unlike the construction where only the taa phrase is fronted
and unlike the construction where no fronting at all takes place, a fronted
prepositional phrase can express only cause/reason, not purpose. Second, this is
the only type of case where a verb-like preposition is fronted with its object;
elsewhere, the preposition must be stranded behind. And third, the taa phrase
need not be indexed on the preposition, even if the preposition has the form uri.
All this suggests that a grammaticalization process may be in progress: the
range of the meanings expressed is smaller than in the other constructions; the
preposition and its complement are fronted together; and taa need not be a
fully-fledged common noun.
The other basic type of construction in which taa occurs is one where it
functions as a modifier of a head noun, specifically as the possessor phrase in a
bare possessive construction. The basic structure of this construction is [X
taa]NP, where X is the head, possessum noun. The meaning of this construction
is ‘what X?’, ‘what type/kind of X?’, ‘which X?’, ‘which type/kind of X?’,
literally ‘X of what?’. A query using this construction may request selection
from an unspecified set, ‘what X?, ‘what type/kind of X?’, or from a restricted,
predetermined set, ‘which X?’, ‘which type/kind of X?’. The glosses ‘what?’
and ‘which?’ are used as appropriate.

Like verbs, nominalizations can have their own complement clauses. For
example, the Class 2 transitive verb soe-toqo ‘ask sb.’ takes as its direct object
the addressee, and in addition there is a (paratactic) complement clause expressing the content of the asking:

NPAST.THEREEven though historically the three situational demonstrative adverbs contain
the perfect-marker/intensifier naqa, it is possible for them to cooccur with naqa
in a clause, although they are not co-constituents. Naqa is a constituent of the
particle group inside a verb phrase, while the situational adverbs are clauselevel constituents.

‘It looked like the (lit.: this) sore had healed then, (but it turned out

A: ‘Whose turn is it now? (Lit.: ‘Who now?’) (When playing

B: ‘Your turn.’ (Lit.: ‘You now.’)The situational adverb neri has two other functions. First, it is used as a kind
of vividness marker. In this function it is used when the reference is to a state of
affairs in the past. Neri makes that state of affairs more immediate, as if it obtained at the time of reference. In saying the sentences in (13-135) a young man
is telling his mother what happened to him:

The three interrogative words fei, fania, and fana are all used to inquire about
locations, but the latter two also have one other function (discussed in section
19.3.8). Fei is a locative adverb (section 4.11). It is the commonest locative
interrogative word and occurs in several constructions. Fania and fana are particles. They are emphatic forms, and their locative use is restricted to one type
of construction.
It is necessary to distinguish locational-sentence interrogatives and other
interrogatives concerning locations. Locational-sentence interrogatives correspond to locational declaratives (section 26.1), and their function is to ask questions ‘Where is X?’. They employ the locative verbs nii ‘be located’ or, much
less commonly, ii ‘be located’. Locational-sentence interrogatives are discussed
first, starting with those using fei.
There are three basic strategies for forming locational-sentence interrogatives using fei. In one, both the fei phrase and the locative verb are in situ, with
fei following the verb. No preposition is used with fei. In another strategy fei is
fronted and it is the complement of the locative preposition qi. In the third strategy the locative verb and fei precede the subject. No preposition is used with
fei. The first two examples below contain interrogatives with both the verb and
fei in situ. This type of construction is by no means uncommon and need not
express an echo question.

to signal that the location inquired about is assumed to be some distance away.
(See section 5.2.14.7 for this function of the directional.)
(19-116)Nee, ma qaburu naqi qe

hey and ogre
this 3SG.NFUT be.located VENT where?
‘Hey, this ogre [that we have been talking about] is where?’The next example illustrates the strategy where fei alone is fronted. In that
case it must be the complement of the locative preposition qi. The locative proform ei, also as a complement of the locative preposition, must be present in the
extraction site. The fronted prepositional phrase with fei is placed in focus.

qaburu naqi qe

be.located=LOC LOCPRO
‘Hey, where is this ogre [we have been talking about]?’
This is the least common of the three types of locational-sentence interrogatives. This may be owing to its relative complexity, because in addition to the
fronted interrogative prepositional phrase with fei another prepositional phrase,
with the locative pro-form ei, is required.
In the third strategy, the locative verb and fei precede the subject: nii/ii fei
X, X being the subject, ‘where is X?’, literally ‘is located where X?’; see also
(19-37) in section 19.3.2. As discussed in that section, even though the locative
verb and fei precede the subject, they are not in the focus position. Locational
interrogative sentences with inverted, [verb.phrase subject] order are used commonly.

synonymous. The difference in form between them is reminiscent of the difference between the full and the reduced forms of the verb-like prepositions (section 10.3.1), for example the ablative forms fasi-a (with the third person singular object suffix -a) and fasa. However, in present-day Toqabaqita at least,
fania and fana do not function as prepositions, and there is no evidence of fania
being morphologically complex (*fani-a).
In (19-120) variant (b), with fania, expresses a more emphatic, insistent
question about the location than variant (a), with fei, does.

‘What is this?’With one type of exception to be discussed in section 19.3.4, interrogative
prepositional phrases headed by a verb-like preposition or by a noun-like preposition cannot be fronted. Only the complement of the preposition is fronted and
the preposition is stranded behind (section 10.6):

type of interrogative sentence where the verb together with an interrogative
phrase precede the subject. This order occurs in one subtype of locational interrogative sentences: a locative verb followed by one of the forms for ‘where?’
precedes the subject:
(19-37)[locative.verb ‘where?’] subjectFor example:
(19-38)Nii
fei
naifa nau baa?
be.located where? knife 1SG that
‘Where is my knife?’ ‘Where is that knife of mine?’Although the verb phrase precedes the subject, it is not in the focus position.
First, the focus marker na cannot occur here. Second, a locative prepositional
phrase that contains fei can be fronted by itself and be in focus. In such cases a
prepositional phrase that consists of the general locative preposition qi and the
locative pro-form ei (section 10.2.2) must appear at the extraction site. In (1939) the locative interrogative phrase i fei ‘(at) where?’ is in focus, and there is a
prepositional phrase with the locative pro-form after the locative verb:
(19-39)Nee, ma
hey andi
LOCfei
na
qaburu naqi qe
where? FOC ogre
this 3SG.NFUTni=i
ei?
be.located=LOC LOCPRO
‘Hey, where is this ogre [we have been talking about]?’
On the other hand, the locative pro-form is not used in the inverted word
order; see (19-38).
And third, as discussed in section 19.3.11, certain intensifying particles can
be used inside interrogative phrases to express emphatic questions, but only if
the interrogative phrase is in focus. In (19-40) the intensifier is qana:
(19-40)Ni

COM-3SG.OBJ‘Who was it that you spoke with?’19.3 Open interrogatives801The intensifying particles cannot be used in the inverted structure.
The inverted word order is not obligatory, and locational interrogatives with
the verb phrase in the canonical position do not necessarily express echo questions:

"The situational demonstrative adverbsThere are three demonstrative adverbs with a combined spatial/temporal-deictic
and a kind of emphatic-identifying function: neri, nena and nabaa. All three
are, historically at least, morphologically complex, but in present-day Toqabaqita they are best regarded as unitary. All three are fusions of the perfectaspect marker/intensifier naqa and the determiner demonstratives qeri, qena
and baa, respectively. Evidence for this will be provided later in this section. In
their deictic functions, the situational demonstratives have both temporal and
locative meaning.
The situational demonstratives are clause-level constituents and occur clause
finally. The verb phrases in which they occur are never complements of prepositions. In declarative and imperative verbal clauses they identify, usually in a
slightly emphatic manner, the state of affairs expressed in the clause as indeed
being such and such. In questions they make the request for information slightly
more emphatic than would be the case otherwise.",[668]

the object of a verb-like preposition and is fronted, the preposition must be
stranded behind, with one exception. Example (19-74) shows preposition
stranding:
(19-74)Taa
na
kera
qoga
qani-a?
what? FOC 3PL.NFUT be.busy GENP-3SG.OBJ
‘What are they busy with?’Exceptionally, preposition-stranding need not take place when a taa phrase
is the complement of the purpose/reason verb-like preposition uri (section
10.3.2). The whole prepositional phrase may be fronted. There are three grammatical possibilities: fronting of the taa phrase alone; no fronting at all; and
fronting of the whole prepositional phrase. However, these options are not all
fully equivalent semantically. When only the taa phrase is fronted and the
preposition is stranded behind, the meaning expressed may be that of purpose
or cause/reason. The question may inquire about the identity of an object with
respect to which the event takes place, as in (19-75) below, or it may inquire
about the overall purpose of the event or about its cause/reason, as in (19-76)
and (19-77), respectively. However, the two different types of purpose are not
always clearly distinguishable. In the context of (19-75) the speaker assumes
that the third person had come to look for something, and the addressee identifies the object:
(19-75)A: Taa

In principle, the question in (19-75) could instead inquire about the overall
purpose of the man’s coming: ‘Why did the man come?’ On the other hand, the
sentence in (19-76) can only function as an inquiry about the purpose of the
overall event.","[861, 862]"
"94The verb phraseBoth the phonological and the conjugation analyses suffer from serious
problems. There is an alternative analysis, one that avoids the problems of the
other two, a morpho-lexemic analysis. On the morpho-lexemic analysis, the
thematic consonants are separate morphs, but they are semantically empty.
There is a pool of thematic consonants that both short and long transitives draw
on, but the types of verb utilize different subsets. Each transitive verb is associated with a particular thematic consonant, sometimes more than one. Since the
thematic consonants are semantically empty, the fact that one and the same
base may be associated with semantically distinct transitive forms with different thematic consonants is not an issue.
For example, the semantic difference between ngata-l-i ‘discuss’ and ngataf-i ‘scold, berate’, which share the base ngata ‘speak, talk’, cannot be attributed
directly to the thematic consonants. Both l and f are found in many other transitive verbs, short and long, and there is no semantic constant that they could be
seen as contributing. The bases of most (though not all) transitive verbs exist as
lexemes in their own right, but the semantic relations between them and the
corresponding transitive verbs are often idiosyncratic. It is the combination of
the base, the thematic consonant (if any) and the transitive suffix (if any) as a
lexical unit that is independently meaningful. It is lexemes that are repositories
of meanings (Aronoff 1994).
The thematic consonants are semantically empty, but that does not necessarily mean that any thematic consonant is equally likely to occur in a verb of a
certain meaning as any other. This will be discussed in the next section. And
although the thematic consonants have been identified as separate morphs, for
simplicity’s sake they will continue to be written as part of the transitive suffixes; for example, kuqu-fi rather than kuqu-f-i ‘drink’ and teqe-mani/teqe-maqi
rather than teqe-m-ani/teqe-m-aqi ‘count, read’.
The relation between transitive verbs and the lexemes formally related to
them is best viewed as one of correspondence rather than one of (directional)
derivation, for two reasons. First, there are transitive verbs whose bases do not
occur as independent lexemes. For example, kwale-ngani/kwale-ngaqi ‘take,
carry, move a lot of things in several trips (rather than all at once)’ is clearly a
long transitive verb, becase of the -ngani – -ngaqi variation in the form of the
transitive suffix, but there is no related lexeme kwale, although there is an intransitive verb that involves reduplication: kwale-kwale ‘move back and forth,
here and there’. Similarly, there is a short transitive verb karu-mi ‘scratch with
fingernails or toenails’ a long transitive karu-mani/karu-maqi ‘beckon sb. (hand
palm down, fingers brought in, in scratching-like motion)’, and also a reciprocal verb kwai-karu-mi ‘scratch each other’, but there is no related lexeme
*karu. Rather, there are two intransitive verbs, both of which involve reduplication: karu-karu ‘make scratching noise’ and kaa-karu ‘beckon’. And second, in
the case of bare transitive verbs positing either derivational direction would be4.2 Types of verbs95arbitrary. For example, is the transitive verb luqu ‘answer, respond to (a person,
question, letter, prayer)’ to be seen as derived from intransitive luqu ‘answer,
respond; give an answer’, or vice versa?
There is one other matter that needs to be discussed in connection with the
transitive suffixes. Since the thematic consonants are separate morphs, this
means that the i of the short transitive suffix also is a separate morph; for example -m-i. And the long transitive suffixes end in i. Should this final i of the
long transitive suffixes be treated as a separate morph, identical to the i of the
short suffixes, as in for example, -m-an-i? There is no compelling reason for
doing so. First, it is not obvious what would be gained by such an analysis.
While segmenting off the thematic consonants is well motivated, there would
be no gain in segmenting off the final i of the long transitive suffixes. Quite to
the contrary. As discussed in section 9.2, deverbal nouns are derived from verbs
by means of the suffix -a. When a deverbal noun is based on a long transitive
verb, the deverbal-noun suffix follows the -Caqi variant of the transitive suffix:
kwai-ngaqi-a ‘grave’, cf. kwai-ngani/kwai-ngaqi ‘bury’. However, when a
deverbal noun is based on a short transitive verb, the i of the transitive suffix is
either omitted or replaced by a: laa-lae-f-a (with reduplication) ‘ladder’, ‘baby
walker: a stick placed horizontally above the ground or the floor and secured at
both ends, so that a baby beginning to learn to walk can hold onto it’, cf. lae-fi
‘go for, go to get st.’; and thuu-fa-a ‘protective, guardian spirit’, cf. thuu-fi
‘cover’, ‘of a spirit, God, Jesus: protect’. The fact that the i of the long transitive suffix and the i of the short transitive suffix behave differently in the formation of deverbal nouns is evidence that they are not the same morpheme. The
i of the short transitive suffix is a morph of its own and it is not retained in
deverbal nouns. On the other hand, the i of the long suffixes is retained in
deverbal nouns, which can be taken as evidence that it is part of the transitive
suffix.
As far as the thematic consonants found in the stem extenders are concerned, the phonological and the conjugation analyses would face some of the
same problems they encounter in connection with the transitive suffixes. In
extended long transitive verbs, there are two thematic consonants: one associated with the transitive suffix and one associated with the stem extender, and
the two consonants are never identical (see further below); for example takwela-ngani/takwe-la-ngaqi ‘stand sb., st. up’. On the phonological analysis, the
analysis would be takwel-ang-ani/takwel-ang-aqi, with both thematic consonants, l and ng, stem-final. The phonological analysis would claim that certain
verbs contain a suffix that ends in a consonant, which would be the only such
affix in the language, and that all such verbs just happen to have a base that
also ends in a consonant. The conjugation analysis would not account for the
fact that the thematic consonants associated with the stem extenders are a
proper subset of the total set of the thematic consonants, and that the variants96The verb phraseare segmentable: -l-a, -r-a, -m-a, -ng-a. Here too the morpho-lexemic analysis
avoids both sets of problems. Each extended long transitive verb is associated
with a certain consonant before the stem extender and with a certain (other)
thematic consonant before the long transitive suffix. The thematic consonants
associated with the stem extenders are empty morphs, but for convenience they
will be represented as part of the stem extenders; thus takwe-la-ngani/takwe-langaqi ‘stand sb., st. up’, rather than takwe-l-a-ng-ani/takwe-l-a-ng-aqi.
Only four consonants occur as thematic consonants associated with the stem
extenders: l, r, m, and ng. Of these, -l is most frequent, and -ng least frequent.
The choice of a thematic consonant is not predictable, but there are some patterns. For a given extended transitive verb, the thematic consonant associated
with the stem extender and the thematic consonant associated with the long
transitive suffix are never identical. Furthermore, not all possible combinations
of unlike thematic consonants occur. In ordinary long transitives, four consonants occur as thematic: t, f, m, and ng. In extended long transitives only two of
them occur as thematic consonants associated with the long transitive suffixes:
t and ng. In fact, only four combinations of stem extenders and transitive suffixes have been attested: base-la-ngani, base-ra-ngani, base-ma-tani, and basenga-tani. A non-nasal consonant associated with the stem extender only cooccurs with a nasal associated with the transitive suffix, and a nasal associated
with the stem extender only cooccurs with a non-nasal associated with the transitive suffix. Of the four combinations of variants of the stem extender and the
variants of the transitive suffix, -la-ngani is most common.
A few extended long transitives have synonymous ordinary long transitives
counterparts, and in such cases the two variants share a thematic consonant. In
some cases, the shared thematic consonant is associated with the transitive suffix in the extended transitive, in others it is associated with the stem extender;
see (4-107) and (4-108), respectively:

consists of mada, the verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the case’, and the third person
singular nonfuture subject marker qe. The second clause is the event clause,
which is grammatically positive. The basic structure of the construction is
shown in (18-61):
(18-61)[mada qe aqi] [event.clause]Mada ‘or’ and the subject marker qe frequently fuse together as mad=e.
The sentence in (18-62), with the negative construction, is synonymous with

The strategy using mada ‘or’ can be combined with the epistemic particle

Usually it is the whole proposition expressed in the event clause that the
speaker is less than fully certain about. However, it is possible to make it explicit that it is only part of the proposition that the uncertainty relates to. In (1866) the mada strategy is combined with the particle toqo, and the latter has only
the focused first person singular pronoun in its scope. The speaker is uncertain
not about the event of the people whispering but about who or what they are
whispering about:

These two forms are sentence pro-forms that signal a relatively high level of
uncertainty about the factual status of a proposition, or even complete lack of
knowledge with respect to a proposition. They occur clause-initially, unless
another element has been fronted, for example in topicalization. They can also
form utterances by themselves.
Botaena and botaqana are mutually interchangeable, the former being
somewhat more common. In one function, they are often used in uncertain replies to questions. If the reply is clausal with a verb, the verb takes the appropriate sequential subject marker.

second one restrictive. The elaborative clause characterizes what the thing that
will be made will look like, specifically that it will look different from the war
club made by somebody else. The latter club is identified by means of a restrictive relative clause.

"640The demonstratives and the demonstrative adverbsThe choice among the three situational adverbs is determined partly by temporal and partly by locative factors. There is a temporal contrast between neri
and nena on the one hand and nabaa on the other; and a locative contrast between neri and nena, defined primarily by the notion of the speaker’s sphere.
Neri and nena have non-past relevance, mostly the time of reference, but occasionally also time after the time of reference. Nabaa has past relevance, before
the time of reference, with, usually implicit, reference to some specific time in
the past. The categories non-past and past have a relative significance: non-past
as not before the time of reference (which itself may be in the past), and past as
before the time of reference. (The determiner demonstrative qeri is used to
designate present time [section 13.3.2.1], and the determiner baa is used with
past-time reference [section 13.3.2.4].)
As far as the contrast between neri and nena is concerned, neri identifies a
state of affairs as being within the speaker’s sphere, while nena identifies a
state of affairs as not being within the speaker’s sphere, often, but not necessarily, in the addressee’s sphere. The speaker’s sphere is pragmatically unmarked:
a sphere is the speaker’s (identified so by means of neri), unless it is specifically identified (by means of nena) as not being so. This is illustrated with examples further below. The notion of the speaker’s sphere is not relevant to nabaa. Nabaa is used about states of affairs located at a time before reference
time, regardless of whether or not they were in the speaker’s sphere.
Neri, nena, and nabaa are glossed, respectively, ‘NPAST.HERE’,
‘NPAST.THERE’ and ‘PAST.THEN’. ‘THEN’ is equivalent to ‘at that time’, not to
‘later, afterwards’.
The contrast between neri and nena is discussed and illustrated first. Sentence (13-105) is about what the speaker is doing, and so it is neri that is used:
(13-105)Kwai
qani-a
keekene

‘I am eating the breadfruit (that is what I am doing).’In the next example, neri serves to emphasize that the person spoken about
was present at that time, because he had not been there earlier:

something, such as at the end of a speech, a story, or a letter:
(13-107)Nia bo=naqa neri.
3SG ASRT=PRF NPAST.HERE
‘That’s all (I have to say).’ ‘That’s it.’ ‘That’s the way it is/was.’The sentence in (13-111) is a question about what the addressee is doing,
and so it is nena that is used:
(13-108)Qo
kafara
nena?
NPAST.THERE
2SG.NFUT make.copra
‘Are you making copra (is that what you are doing)?’In the next example, there is alternation between neri and nena. The person
first tells the addressee that she is waiting for him, and uses neri. After waiting
in vain for a while, she changes her mind, and tells the addressee to wait for
her; she will go over to him. And in that sentence she uses nena.
(13-109)Nau ku
1SG 1SG.NFUTmaqasi qoe
wait.for 2SGneri.
NPAST.HERE[After a while.]Maqasi nau nena.
wait.for 1SG NPAST.THERE
‘I’m waiting for you here.’ [After a while.] ‘Wait for me there.’
The notion of the speaker’s sphere is extendible to states of affairs where
there is no specific location: the world as a whole is viewed as being in the
speaker’s sphere. In (13-110) the speaker is inquiring about time:
(13-110)Manga taa neri?
time
what? NPAST.HERE
‘What time is it now?’In (13-111) there is no implication that the man is present on the scene and
that he is singing at the moment. The statement is about a general, timeless state
of affairs:
(13-111)Wane nguu-la-n=e
leqa
neri.
man sing-NMLZ-3SG.PERS=3SG.NFUT be.good NPAST.HERE
‘The man does sing well.’ (Lit.: ‘The man, his singing is good.’)642The demonstratives and the demonstrative adverbsEven situations brought about by the addressee can be presented as being in
the speaker’s sphere. This may be because of locative proximity, or perceived
locative proximity, between the two of them, or because the situation does, in
some relevant way, concern the speaker. In the next example, from a telephone
conversation, the speaker and the addressee are physically in very distant
places, but because they are directly and immediately communicating with each
other, the addressee and those with him can be treated as being in the speaker’s
sphere:
(13-112)Qoo, kamuluqa muki
fanga
neri?
2PL.IPFV
eat
NPAST.HERE
oh, 2PL
‘Oh, are you eating (is that what you are doing)?’And in (13-113) the speaker, a mother, prohibits her children from doing
again what they have done before, because that would place all of them (including her) in danger:
(13-113)Mosi
2DU.NEGili-li-a
do-RDP-3SG.OBJnaq=i
PRF=LOCburi
later.timeneri!
NPAST.HERE
‘Don’t you ever do that again!’On the other hand, the speaker may choose to present an event that he or she
is performing or will perform as being outside of his or her sphere, for example,
because it has or will have a significant effect on another entity, and/or because
it will take place at another location. Both of these factors are present in the
next example: the situation will significantly affect the addressee and will, of
necessity, take place at the addressee’s location. The time of the event is future.

NPAST.THERE(Normally, it is rude to refer directly to another person’s mouth, and this kind
of threat is usually directed at children.)
When the speaker and the addressee are together in one location and a state
of affairs holds at some other location, either neri or nena may be used. When
the distance is relatively small, neri is more likely than nena: the situation is in
the speaker’s sphere. In the situation expressed in (13-115), two people hear a
noise nearby. Person A uses neri in his question, and B uses neri in his reply:13.7 The situational demonstrative adverbs(13-115)A: Taa

See also (13-134) further below.
On the other hand, if a state of affairs is located a relatively long distance
away both from the speaker and from the addressee, it is nena that is more
likely to be used: the situation is not in the speaker’s sphere. In the situation
expressed in (13-116), the possums are some distance away from the speaker
and the addressee, who are together; note the ventive directional mai, which
signifies distance from the deictic centre, and the locative demonstrative fuuri
‘down there’, which too signals distance from the deictic centre:

‘I am a dead woman.’ ‘I will certainly die.’ (Lit.: ‘I am a woman

The general locative demonstrative adverbs are not used to point at or point out
an entity or a location. For example, they may be used when the entity or location in question is not visible. They may be used if the entity or location is visible, but in that case it is normally not pointed at.
There are a number of non-elevational distal forms, some of which are phonological variants of each other: lakoo, lokoo, likoo; and labaa, libaa. The
members of the two sets are semantically equivalent. Lakoo is the commonest
form, while likoo and libaa are rare.
There is no speaker-proximal form and no addressee-proximal form (table
13.4 in section 13.6.1), which is most likely due to the functions of the general
locative adverbs. These adverbs are commonly used when the entity or location
is not visible. However, when an entity or a location is proximal to the speaker
or to the addressee, it is normally visible and can be pointed at or shown, and
this obviates the need for dedicated speaker-proximal and addressee-proximal
general locative adverbs. How locations in the speaker’s sphere or in the addressee’s sphere can be referred too is mentioned further below.
Adverb phrases that contain the elevational forms loori ‘up there’ or fuuri
‘down there’ normally occur as complements of the general locative preposition
qi. These are the only types of adverb phrase with a general locative adverb that
do.
Examples with the general locative adverbs are given below.

In (19-121) all three variants show the possibility of using either the verb nii

show the possibility of using either fania or fani as the emphatic interrogative

thatThe constructions nii fania and nii fana have another, non-locative use,
which is discussed in section 19.3.8.
The next example contains the less common locative verb ii in an elliptical
interrogative:
(19-122)Ii
fei?
be.located where?
‘Where (is it)?’There is one other way to ask about the location of somebody or something,
which, however, involves neither an interrogative locative form nor a locative
or any other verb. Such sentences consist of a noun phrase where the noun is
modified by the determiner demonstrative of absence baa (section 13.3.2.4).
Frequently, such reduced sentences are introduced by the conjunction ma ‘and’.
There is a rise in intonation at the end of the utterance. Although such questions
are ostensibly non-specific queries about the relevant entity, they are normally
used when the speaker is looking for someone or something that is not where
he/she expects him/her/it to be.

We can now consider interrogatives concerning locations that are not of the
locational-sentence type. There only fei is available as the interrogative word,
and usually, although not always, it is the complement of a preposition. The fei
phrase normally occurs in situ. The following prepositions can govern fei: locative qi, used for locations and locative goals; allative uri for locative goals; and
ablative fasi for locative sources. Being an adverb, fei is not indexed on the two
verb-like prepositions uri and fasi.","[874, 875]"
"Ma may be preceded by an interjection, or by a pro-sentence form, such as
iu ‘yes’, ‘OK’, also used to express agreement with, acknowledgement of, what

"Pretence verbThere is (at least) one pretence verb in the language, the intransitive verb lole
‘pretend that such and such is the case, fake such and such being the case’. Lole
can also function as an intransitive verb with the sense ‘tell a lie/lies’:

governmentTo express the content of a lie, a clause that contains the verb lole (intransitive or transitive) is followed by a coordinate clause that contains a locutionary

is ‘pretend that such and such is the case, fake such and such being the case’.
Lole-qe takes nominalizations or deverbal nouns as its incorporated objects (see
also section 12.4.1). Such incorporated nominalizations or deverbal nouns encode the state of affairs that is faked. Since such nominalizations or deverbal
nouns are incorporated objects and so form a single lexical unit, a compound,
with lole-qe, they are not complements. Nevertheless, the construction is included here on the grounds that nominalizations may be involved and that the
intransitive verb lole does take nominalization complements, as shown further
below.
Since with lole-qe the nominalizations or deverbal nouns in question are
incorporated objects, they occur immediately after the verb. Any postverbal
particle(s) that may be present must follow the verb–nominalization/deverbal
noun compound. In (29-201) the compound contains a nominalization. The
compound is followed by the self-benefactive marker:

‘I faked death and remained motionless.’Alternatively, to express the meaning ‘pretend that such and such is the case,
fake such and such being the case’ the intransitive verb lole can be used. It
takes a nominalization or a deverbal noun as an oblique object with the general
preposition qani. Compare (29-203a), where the nominalization is an incorpo-1052Complement clausesrated object of the detransitivized form lole-qe, and the synonymous (29-203b),

"13.6.2. The presentative locative demonstrative adverbs
The presentative demonstrative adverbs are used when the entity in question is
visible at that location and can be pointed at or pointed out (as when a speaker
is holding it in his or her hands). Syntactically, they can function as part of the
predicate (see [4-1] in section 4.1), or they can form the predicate. They tend to
be said emphatically, with relatively strong stress and on higher pitch, especially when they alone form the predicate. With the exception of the addresseeproximal form nena, all the others end in a syllable that consists of a glottal
stop and a vowel that is identical to the vowel in the preceding syllable: neqe,
lakoqo, fuqu, etc. More often than not, the final vowel is deleted (see section
2.2.1): neq, lakoq, fuq, etc. Adverb phrases that contain a presentative adverb
do not function as complements of prepositions.
The first set of examples contains verbless sentences with the presentative
demonstratives forming the predicate. In this function the adverbs are used in
presentational identificational sentences (section 27.2.2.2).

(13-79)A: Qoo, teqe thaqaro neqe.
oh, one possum here
B: Thaqaro taa
nena?
possum what? there(2)
A: ‘Oh, there is a possum here.’
B: ‘What kind of possum is it there?’ (Male or female?)The non-elevational distal forms lakoqo and lokoqo are phonological variants of each other, the former being more common. The third distal form labaqa is synonymous with lakoqo/lokoqo.

the day after tomorrow”.’28.2.3. Bii and bia
Both bii and bia are commonly used to coordinate noun phrases (section
11.2.1). There the form bii is used if the coordinand to the right is a pronominal
noun phrase, and bia is used if the coordinand to the right is a lexical noun
phrase. Bii and bia can link clauses, but only under restricted circumstances.
They cannot link sentences, nor can they introduce independent sentences the
way ma can. They can only connect clauses when the relation between the
propositions is simple additiveness, and it is not sequential. They cannot connect clauses when the relation is one of result/consequence or contrast/unexpectedness. But even in the additiveness function, bii and bia are
extremely rare.46
The next two examples show bii and bia, respectively, in their clausecoordinating function. In the former, bia could be used in place of bii, and in
the latter bii could be used in place of bia. And both forms could be replaced by
ma.
