"Response. A section usually has two participants, the speaker and the listener who makes the
response.
The response usually is a reply to the speaker’s words or an acknowledgment of his words, by the
repetition of the speaker's words, either the complete utterance or the final portion of it. The
section-final pause (a down glide) signals the listener to provide the response. Occasionally the
listener may interrupt before the section-final pause. The speaker usually continues with what he
was saying, ignoring the interruption.
in order to signal that he is finished, the speaker repeats (Repit) the response of the listener. This
also permits a chaige of speakers so that the listener becomes the speaker.

When additional participants desire to add to a conversation, they do not do so overtly. They do
it by interjecting (Inter) a comment preceding the new section. (See 3.3 [1J.) They choose one of
the main participants, usually a relative, such as a wife, husband, brother or mother through whom
to talk. The culture decrees that only certain individuals freely converse with each other. For
example, a mother-in-law greets her son-in-law, but then she talks to him through her daughter.
Only if there is no other appropriate relative through whom she may converse, does she speak to
him directly.
if a wife wishes to participate in a conversation which her husband is having with another man or
woman she tells her husband what to say to that individual. She uses the command form jaade, ‘tell
him’. The husband repeats what she has said, omitting the command form. The second speaker then
responds to what the husband has said, ignoring the wife.
The two main speakers usually talk loud enough for all to hear and they do not face one another
but sit or stand with their backs to each other.
A response is obligatory and is one of the following:
