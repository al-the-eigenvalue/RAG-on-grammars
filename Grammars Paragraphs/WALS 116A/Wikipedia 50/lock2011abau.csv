3. Use of measurement and polar questions in verbless clausesVerbless clauses do differentiate between measurement and polar
questions in spite of the fact that verbless clauses do not differentiate
between perfective and imperfective aspect. When the interrogative
speech utterance marker is needed, only so, ko and mo are selected but
never o.
In (140), the interrogative pankaw occurs clause-finally in a verbless
clause. There is no co-occurring speech marker. The question is
understood as a polar question.

7.5.3.4 Reason interrogative
The interrogative pro-word encoding reason consists of the nonhuman interrogative pay ‘what’ (derived from po-ay ‘Q-what’) followed
by the pronoun hokuaw ‘for what reason?’. Hokuaw ‘for what reason?’
has as constituents: the general topical marker ho- and -kuaw ‘for reason
of’. Hokuaw is used by itself at clause level. (See for further discussion
§6.7)288In (142) payhokuaw is used as an adverbial phrase.

‘As for that (you just said), why is it?’
In (144), payhokuaw functions as a conjunction. It is possible that this
use of the interrogative ‘why’ as ‘because’ had been influenced by Tok
Pisin, where the interrogatives bilong wanem ‘why’ and long wanem
‘because’ are used as a reason conjunction. Although the constituents of
payhokuaw ‘because/why’ correspond closely to the constituents of Tok
Pisin long wanem ‘why’, people believe that the usage of this word is true
Abau, pre-dating the advent of Tok Pisin in the area (§9.3.3).

7.5.3.5 Goal interrogative
The interrogative paneke ‘why’ is possibly derived from pay-nok e ‘in

In (137), the topic marker mokwe which occurred in (136) has been
deleted. The noun phrase youk ‘paddle’ is separated by a pause from
pankaw. The clause is still marked by mo for perfective aspect, the
question is therefore a quantity question.

Whenever pankaw occurs in a clause with perfective intonation, it
always co-occurs with a perfective speech utterance marker. No examples
of clauses with a request for measurement using the interrogative pankaw
have been observed without a speech utterance marker.
2. Polar questionWhen pankaw occurs in a clause with imperfective aspect, it indicates
a polar question.
In (138), the clause-final verb lwak ‘to be’ has imperfective aspect as
signalled by the clause intonation. The sentence is a polar question which
is not a request to give the number of workmen, but to verify or deny the
state as described in the predicate.

Section 7.5.2 dealt with interrogatives that function as a NP or as a
modifying part of a NP . Five interrogatives which are used adverbially are
discussed in this section. They cannot be marked for syntax and they are
listed in Table 50. When used adverbially these interrogatives
immediately precede the verb phrase.
Three of the five interrogative have counterparts that are adverbial
referents which indicate location, manner and measurement.

The basic adverbs of location are serey ‘there’ and erey ‘here’. (These
forms are derived from ley ‘go’, prefixed by the distal demonstrative soand the proximal demonstrative o-, resulting in sorey and orey. (The
vowel harmony rule also allows the forms serey and erey.)
The derived location interrogative is perey ‘where’ (or the less
frequent po-erey; both forms are acceptable). In (131), the location
interrogative is used as an adverb.

7.5.3.2 Manner/contents interrogative
The manner or contents interrogative is penkin ‘how’, derived from
po- prefixed to enkin. It is used adverbially as in (132) and (133).

The interrogative pankaw ‘to what extent’ is derived from po-ankaw
‘Q-Degree’. When used with perfective aspect, it is a request for
measurement or quantity. When used with imperfective aspect, it indicates
a polar question.
1. Measurement questionExample (134) shows the use of pankaw in a clause ending with a
perfective speech utterance marker, indicating a request for a
measurement or quantity.
(134) “Hai hiykwe
hyo

‘“As for his workmen how many did he appoint?” “Ten.”’
It is not obligatory that pankaw follows immediately the NP it
modifies for measurement. In (135) the subject hunkwe ‘2S.TOP’
intervenes. The determining factor is the clause-final speech marker so
that marks the clause for perfective.
(135) “Huok-won-hu

ACC-carry Q.SP.PFTV.M
‘“Regarding the cooking oil, how many (bottles) did you
buy?” “I bought one.”’
In (136), the clause-final speech marker mo marks perfective aspect.
The question formed with pankaw is therefore not a polar question but a
quantity question.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299]"

can fill the comment slot in a verbless clause (105).
The question in (105) is asked of a female. This information is carried
by the feminine speech marker ko that follows the interrogative.

As stated above, the basic form for the personal interrogative is poso.
The genitive would be *poso-o, which reduces by vowel syncope to poso.

interrogative.

In (109), the speaker anticipates that the answer to the question is a
single recipient and therefore the singular speech marker so is used. If the
speaker does not know if the answer will refer to a male or female
recipient, the masculine speech marker so is used. The feminine speech
marker ko is only used if the speaker knows that the recipient of the knife
is a female.
7.5.1.2 Non-human interrogative functioning as head of the NP
The non-human interrogative is pay ‘what’, derived from with the
interrogative prefix po- and the suffix -ay. (Vowel syncope rule:
VoØ/_V# )
This question word is used to seek to establish the identity of nonhuman entities which includes animals (but not spirits) and all nonanimate nouns. The interrogative is marked for gender and number by a
separate pronoun or marker following the interrogative. The interrogative
can be followed by some of the postpositional markers or by a pronoun
that is syntactically marked for object and subject.
When the non-personal interrogative functions as subject, it is
obligatorily copied by a personal subject pronoun suffixed with -kwaw.
The marker -kwaw is analysed as the restrictive marker (see §3.1.4). In
combination with the non-human interrogative it can be translated as
‘what in particular’. In (110), hiykwaw follows the interrogative pay:pay mepay homkwawPLpay monwith Locative(113)pay sokwith PunctiliarEx.pay nonNPPostpositionalwith Comitative(111)pay se/ kepay hohkwawDU(110)pay keobservedpay hokwawS.FModifierpay seNotpay hiykwawS.MObject NPGenitiveSubject NPTABLE 48: NON-HUMAN INTERROGATIVE - IDENTIFICATION OF NON-HUMAN OBJECTS(117)pay NOUNModifier

which lists NPs with postpositional markers. No number and gender
distinctions occur in these postpositional constructions.

The three location interrogatives in this section poho, pokwo and
pomo are used exclusively as the comment constituent in verbless
questions. They are frequently used to seek information about the location
of an entity (114).

Location is always the focus, except when one wants information
about a person’s name. This is an interesting exception. Names in the
local culture form a major part of a person’s identity and their use (and
especially non-use) is controlled by many cultural customs. It is not
always appropriate to directly ask a person’s name. It is possible that these
cultural sensitivities have influenced the form of questions about names.
Example (116) contains a request to give name identification.

A number of interrogatives may precede the head of the NP. In that
position they classify the head phrase for categories as location, kind,
manner, uniqueness etc. The interrogative forms together with the noun it
precedes a unified stress unit. This stress unit is exceptional in the sense
that the interrogative takes the initial stress within the NP. This stress
contour is somewhat similar to the stress contour over compound nouns,278where the initial noun always has the primary stress, even when the first
noun within the compound noun modifies the second.
The following interrogatives can take the role of modifier within the
noun phrase.
pay
– non-human entity identification
poso – human entity identification
perey – location identification
penkin – manner identification
pohiy, pohok, pohom – request identification in contrast to other
known entities (§7.5.2.1)
In (117), pay precedes the head of the NP and displays a very
prominent stress and forms with the noun it modifies one unified stress
unit. The interrogative is used to ascertain a certain subset of the entity it
modifies.

The interrogative poso can be a modifier in a NP preceding the head of
the noun phrase as is exemplified in (118) and (119). The interrogative
poso is not an embedded NP marked for genitive case here as is true for
(106) and (107). In a genitive construction two entities are compared with
each other: the owner and the owned. In the examples below, however,
there is only one entity within the NP whose identity is enquired after by
means of the modifying interrogative.","[286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292]"

2S-TOP
‘Why did you come? (Lit. In order to do what did you

The analysis above is given with some hesitation. The interrogative is
presently pronounced as paneke, while there seems to be no reason why
the first syllable was reduced from pay to pa. In light of the lack of
convincing evidence, the interrogative paneke will be simply labeled
‘why’ in the interlinear examples.
The interrogatives payhokuaw and paneke can be interchanged in
most contexts. But some speakers make a distinction. If the above analysis
on the semantic origin of both terms is correct it suggests a distinction
between reason and (mental) goal. The former (payhokuaw) might be
used when motives and explanations are asked for, the latter (paneke)
when intentions and objectives are sought after. It has been noted that
rhetorical questions tend to be constructed with paneke, although not all
the time. This is probably not surprising since a rhetorical question
sometimes focuses on the goal and sometimes on the reason of a certain
issue. The three examples with payhokuaw above all seem to fit the
definition here, since they can all be viewed as questions regarding
background and source motive.
Example (146) illustrates a rhetorical question. It is probably arbitrary
whether the question zooms in on the reason (for what reason) or the goal
(to what end).

sentence topic and comment
Constituents within the sentence are marked or positioned in such a
way that the sentence can be easily divided in a topic part and a comment
part. Some sentences also have a third part: a phrase or clause in tail
position. The division between the topic and comment part is a prominent
feature of the language and plays an important role in the creation of
comprehensible and logical communication.
The focal point of this chapter is to shed light on the distinctions in
relative prominence of the various phrase constituents within a sentence.
It starts with a discussion on the concept of topic (§8.1) and the overall
structure of an Abau sentence (§8.2). This is followed by a presentation of
the structure and the internal ordering of the constituents within both the
topic part (§8.3) and the comment part (§8.4) of the sentence. A
discussion about the tail position (§8.5) is also included. The chapter
concludes with discussions how constituents within the sentence can be
given less or more prominence (§8.6), how participants are tracked (§8.7),
and lastly, what features distinguish the backgrounding, foregrounding
and climax within a discourse (§8.8).","[302, 303, 304, 305]"
"394In text types where opinion or persuasive argumentation are central,
the speaker will make use of hortative commands and hypothetical
questions to mark paragraph boundaries and even episode boundaries.
Some connectives and conjunctions are very useful in building up
propositions that will support a certain premise or opinion. Examples
include:
x Frequent use of inclusive devices. E.g. the use of hromkwe ‘we’;
or the connective seyr ‘and also’ that joins constituents of equal
status. (Can be used to add support or further evidence for one’s
premise.)
x Frequent use of devices that express real or hypothetical
conditions or alternatives, e.g. conditional clauses marked by
ankin ‘if’; positing of hypothetical questions that will support the
main idea.
x Frequent use of devices that express reason or logical
consequences. E.g. conjunction payhokuaw ‘why, because’; the
adverbial demonstratives sehe, sokwe and seme, to establish
logical consequence.
x Frequent use of hortatory statements (let’s …) or value statements
(this is good/bad).
Examples (17-20) are consecutive sentences taken from a speech to
encourage better maintenance of the village clinic. The first sentence in
(17) is a value statement about the presence of the Aid Post. This is the
supposition that the speaker will build on.

"9.2.2 Discourse cohesion markers sei and hai
The cohesion markers sei and hai are similar in distribution. They
occur clause-initially and are often set apart by a pause from the rest of the
clause. They are also semantically very similar. Their use not only
validates the sentence or discourse that went before as true, it also views it
as completed. The function of the cohesion markers is to bring closure to
what went before and to initiate a new starting point for the evolving
discourse. Some speakers use the two markers interchangeably, although
others feel they should be distinguished. Based on the observations of the
latter group the following distinctions are noted:
a. Sei ‘all right’ often expresses agreement to an already known or
anticipated plan of action, while hai ‘O.K.’ may introduce or
suggest a yet unknown or not expected plan of action.
b. Sei is mostly used in direct speech and not in descriptive texts.
c. Hai ‘O.K.’ is often used in questions.
d. Hai is also often used in procedural text introducing new steps or
activities. (Some speakers will use sei in procedural texts as well.)
Sei ‘all right’ often expresses agreement as can be seen in (13) and
(14).

‘Father said, “As for today, the two of us will go hunt birds.”

Hai occurs sentence-initially and gives special focus and importance
to the sentence it precedes. It is used in conversation to request special
attention for the statement it introduces. It is often used in questions as in
(15).

Speakers disagree on whether or not sei and hai can be used

direct speech. They would regard the substitution of hai in (16) with the
marker sei as incorrect language use.

The cohesive marker seseyn can be paraphrased as ‘it was done as
was said’. It occurs sentence-initially and is often set apart from the rest of
the clause by a pause. This marker takes into its scope previous discourse
and relates it to the predicate following, marking this predicate in
accordance with the discourse that went before. Seseyn is always followed
by a distinctive pause. In (17), seseyn refers back to a single sentence:
(17) Hom me,

lake in preparation.”’ (Context: Part of the group goes out
before the others to start the process of stirring up poison in
the water to kill the fish. The rest of the group joins in later
when the poison starts to take effect.)
In (18), seseyn occurs sentence-initially. It takes into its scope the
previous sentence, and connects it to the predication following, marking
the latter in accordance with the former.","[365, 366, 367]"

Procedural texts may end with the phrase senkinaw as well, or with
some other phrase that will indicate the end of the procedure explained.
Example (25) is the final sentence of a procedural text.

‘As for this job with the sago stalks, it is the last work.’
In some cases no formulaic expressions are used, but the speaker
terminates with a fitting ending, e.g. returning to the village, resolution of
a problem, or even advice to the addressee. The speaker links this ending
in some cohesive way to the preceding discourse.
Example (26) is the last sentence of a non-fiction narrative, when the
two men return home after an unsuccessful fishing trip. The object
demonstrative sehe preceding the verb phrase, anaphorically refers to the
reasons why they came home without food.

Post, which contains important advice to the addressees. The object
demonstrative sehe establishes a logical relationship with the preceding
discourse.

‘That’s why I am telling you this, so that you should look

It is also not unusual, especially in hortatory or expository texts, to
add a new supporting argument to the main point in the last sentence of
the text. Example (28-29) is taken from an expository text that deals with
the question: can men send away their wives in a childless marriage? The
author argues against the dismissal of wives. He has several arguments,
but the new supporting argument that women cannot be blamed for
something they were born with is tagged nearly as an afterthought to the
end. The feature of closing the discourse with a new supporting argument
might in some cases be an indication of an ill-prepared speaker. However,
the technique has been observed enough in speeches to consider the
possibility that the speaker may use it as a device to convince his listeners.
By bringing up a new argument in his final sentence, he leaves the listener
with new evidence that supports his view. He thereby gives the impression
that many more arguments in favour of his point of view might have been
brought forward.
The speaker could have concluded with the hortatory remark in (28).
However, he adds a new argument (29) and makes this the closing remark
of the speech.","[410, 411, 412]"
"420a. The name of the addressee is preferably another name than the
officially given name. The addressee may be referred to by a nickname,
e.g. hiymei hay ‘the very tall one’ or a kinship term.
b. The introductory greetings include a statement about the author’s
wellbeing and may include an enquiry about the addressee’s health,
although the latter is not always needed as can be seen in §11.7. These
introductory greetings are rarely skipped, not even in letters expressing
anger. Like all discourse introductions, these greetings are heavily topicmarked.
c. The author sets the stage for introducing his main point or request
first. This argumentation can either remove obstacles that hinder this main
point or request or state certain facts that buttress it, e.g. (74-75).
d. The main point or request may be made less direct by introductory
sentences that talk about the request but do not explicitly state it yet (76).
e. The conclusion consists of final greetings that focus primarily on
the addressee and his or her family. The formulaic closing often includes
senkinaw ‘that’s all’.
The letter in §11.7 contains a request to be allowed to work on a
building project. The author is an elementary teacher who has left his
work. The teacher removes the possible objection that he cannot be hired
for the building project, since he has left his responsibilities as a teacher.
He stresses the fact of his availability by explaining further why he is not
likely to return to his teaching role. In examples (74) and (74), he also
rules out the possibility of an offer to teach in a different village, by
stating that he is not really interested in being a teacher.

‘I said that as for continually being an elementary teacher, I
was not really interested (lit. I was not with very important
heart/thoughts).’
The main point, or main request of a letter is rarely placed in the
beginning of the letter. The actual request in the letter in §11.7 is made
towards the end of the letter, after the author has already elaborated on the
fact that he is fully available for the job he is requesting. The author wants
to make himself agreeable and non-controversial. The use of the noncontrastive seyr is also a helpful device in that respect.
The final request is not stated abruptly, but is introduced with a short
introductory sentence that leads up to the question as is illustrated in (76).

This introduction sentence is followed by two very different,
unrelated requests (§11.7). The first request (to become enrolled in
medical training) is immediately followed by the second request to be
made part of the building crew for an upcoming building project. This last
request was in all likelihood the reason why the letter was written (see
§11.7 for last part of letter).","[433, 434, 435]"
"4.1.1 Determining the boundaries of the verb phrase
Verb phrase boundaries are defined with the help of three important
features. They are listed here in order of their usefulness in the
determination of verb phrase boundaries:
a. The beginning of the verb phrase is easily recognisable since it
always carries the most salient stress which is associated with the
highest pitch within the clause, see (1);
b. A number of markers which are not part of the verb phrase work
together to form negation and interrogative constructions that
enclose the entire verb phrase, see (2) and (3);
c. Phrases in Abau are frequently separated by distinct pauses. If
there is a pause, one can assume it marks the end of a phrase,
since a pause does not occur within a phrase. Not every phrase is
clearly separated by pauses, but there is often a distinct pause
between the last topicalised constituent within the clause and the
non-topicalised constituent following, see (4).
In (1), yaprue ‘good’ is not part of the VP since it does not carry the
most salient stress within the clause. The most prominent stress within the
clause is on lie ‘go.up’ and this signals the beginning of the VP. Therefore,
yaprue ‘good’ is analysed as a separate adverbial modifier modifying the
verb phrase.
PEAK(1) Aiai hiy ma saro somokwe
yaprue 'lie.
aiai hiy ma saro so-mo-kwe
yaprue lie
food 3S.M RCM plant DDEM-GL.PL-TOP good
go.up
‘The food that he planted grew really well.’
Secondly, a number of constructions that mark negation or questions
make use of constituents that enclose the entire verb phrase.
In (2), the VP is embraced by two constituents that express negated
dynamic modality liy … ley ‘DYN … NEG’. The modal marker liy ‘DYN’ is
not part of the VP since it does not carry the highest pitch. The negation
word ley is not part of the verb phrase since it functions at sentence level.
The VP is underlined and the onset of the VP is marked by an apostrophe.",[138]
"7.2.1 The future marker a
It is noteworthy that the future marker a occurs only in affirmative
sentences when it co-occurs with either the aspect markers po ‘IMM.FUT’
or ya ‘INDF.FUT’ (see §5.2.7 where po … a and ya ... a are analysed as
discontinuous morphemes).
In (8), the future marker a co-occurs obligatorily with po ‘IMM.FUT’ in
an affirmative sentence to express immediate future.

When a ‘FUT’ does not co-occur with the aspect markers po
‘IMM.FUT’ or ya ‘INDF.FUT’, its distribution is restricted to questions. In
(9), the future marker a is used with the interrogative penkin. (All markers236occurring before and after the verb phrase are bolded. The verb phrase
itself is underlined.)

The indefinite future markers ane and aney also occur only in
questions. Speakers tend to interchange ane and aney when editing texts.
Both markers are used to express future uncertainty and signal some sort
of predicament. There is a tendency to use ane to describe a future
predicament that seems to have no solution available and aney to describe
a predicament for which options for a resolution can be offered. In (10)
and (11), ane is used to express the lack of options the subject has to
resolve the issue at hand.

considered to have options available to resolve the issue at hand.

The indefinite future markers a, ane and aney can occur after the
modal marker pak ‘Dubitative’. They are used in interrogatives about
future uncertainties. The difference between pak aney and pak ane has
again to do with the level of control. When the agent has some measure of
control over future uncertainties pak aney is used (14). A low measure of
control is expressed by pak ane (15).

It is hard to determine when pak a should be used in contrast to pak
ane and pak aney. There seems to a tendency to use pak a for situations
that indicate future uncertainty which do not require immediate action to
resolve this uncertainty. This is in agreement with how ane and aney have
been analysed. Example (16) and (17) at least confirm this analysis. It
needs to be repeated though that it is hard to find unanimity among native
speakers when the three options of pak a, pak ane and pak aney are
discussed.

The negation markers, pey and pa occur clause-finally. The marker
pey is used to negate clauses with imperfective aspect and pa is used to
negate clauses with perfective aspect. As stated before, the imperfective
often has present time reference, as can be seen in (18). It is used for the
habitual (19) and (20) and can be expected to be used whenever a general
truth, or characteristic behaviour or features are described.","[249, 250, 251, 252]"
"1.10 Acknowledgements
This current grammar write-up is based on research conducted by me
over a period of more than 20 years under the auspices of the Papua New
Guinea Branch of SIL International. My wife and I learned to speak the
language, collected stories and studied the local culture. We were able to
involve a large number of Abau speakers in the establishment of the
current orthography and in the development of a three year curriculum in
the vernacular for the 25 Abau speaking villages along the Sepik River.
The vast majority of the examples in this grammar paper have been taken
from a corpus of non-elicited texts of 85,000 words.
We want to thank the Yabru community for allowing us to live among
them since September 1982. We especially thank our friends and fellowworkers Obow Inaru and Alex Nomben, who, along with many others,
have helped us to gain many valuable insights into the language.
A special word of thanks goes to our colleagues within SIL whose
encouragement and input have been essential in gaining insights in the15structure of the Abau language. I want to thank Bob Conrad not only for
his assistance in producing the Abau Grammar essentials in 1985
(unpublished manuscript) but also for his willingness to be one of the
editors in the final stages of the current document. Secondly, I want to
thank the late Cindi Farr for her enthusiasm and keen insights into how
information is marked for relative prominence within Abau texts. A major
part of this paper was finished under her supervision in 1999.
In 2007, I was encouraged to make the research available to the wider
public. SIL colleague Ian Tupper probed me with many questions about
the wording of certain sections that needed further work. He also kindly
gave me many suggestions and editorial comments for the other sections. I
believe they have improved the overall clarity of this grammar. Thanks
are also due to Lisa Halverson who did a fine job in preparing the
manuscript for publication, John Carter who produced two of the maps,
several people in Ukarumpa who did the final proofreading and René van
den Berg who oversaw the whole process as series editor.
Lastly, I want to thank my wife Maija for her encouragement and
support. The current grammar write-up does not reflect sufficiently the
many warm and meaningful friendships she helped to develop with our
Abau friends.","[28, 29]"

for evaluative comments once the description of the procedure is finished.

Descriptive texts are similar to procedural texts in that they are
informative and non-emotive. Procedural and descriptive texts both make
extensive use of the imperfective, since these texts often prescribe or
describe general or habitual behaviour. This is in contrast with narrative
texts which make extensive use of the perfective to describe unique events
that in their totality took place in the past.
Whereas procedural texts are concerned with the correct manner to
perform a task, descriptive texts are concerned with the description of
observed behaviour or characteristics. Descriptive texts centre around a
global theme that is often a directly observable entity (e.g. animal, place,
custom, activity).
Descriptive texts make frequent use of verbless clauses: a topicalised
entity is supplied with a comment that either gives additional information
to that entity or supplies the entity with a certain identity. In (51), the first
topic NP is further defined for attributive characteristics, the second topic
NP is further identified for role.

Descriptive texts tend to have very few non-topicalised NPs that are
syntactically marked for subject or object. This in contrast to narrative
texts where non-topicalised NPs occur frequently. In (53-60), there is no
occurrence of a non-topicalised subject and only one example of a nontopicalised object.
Descriptive texts are also characterised by a high number of verbless
clauses or clauses formed with the stative verb lwak like e.g. (53) and411(54). The two topicalised NPs marked by mokwe occur in clauses that are
formed with the stative verb lwak. (Below in (53-60), all topic markers are
bolded.)

Non-topicalised NPs with syntactic marking are relatively rare in
descriptive texts. That is especially true for non-topicalised NPs marked
for subject and to a lesser extent for non-topicalised NPs marked for
object. The NP iwar me ‘people, human beings’ in (52) is an example of
such an occurrence.
The bolded NPs in (55) and (56) are respectively marked for object
and subject, but are topicalised as well.

Participants and props that are referred to in a descriptive text often do
not represent an individual, unique entity. This in contrast to narrative
texts, where participants and props have their own identity and often play
roles in specific, unique events. Many of the entities referred to in a
descriptive text are not uniquely identifiable entities, but often function as
representatives for their type or category. The marking on the NPs reflects
this. In (57), hmo pion mokwe ‘their meat’ has patient role, but it is not412marked for object. It is only marked by the general topic marker mokwe.
This is in line with the fact that the NP does not represent a single
identifiable entity, but represents the meat of all other wondeis-snakes as
well.

Descriptive texts can contain instructive sections that look very
similar to sections of a procedural text, e.g. the text “The snake” (§11.4)
moves from descriptive to instructive in the second part of the text. When
a descriptive text becomes instructive, an addressee is needed. Below, the413addressee is referred to by hwon ‘2S.SUB’ which functions as a universal
‘you’ taking into its scope all who hear or read this text.
In (61-63), possible scenarios are given in subordinate clauses marked
by ankin ‘if’ which are followed by a main clause expressing a command.
In (61), the command is marked by the prohibitive marker pese, and in
(63), the command is marked by the hortative marker kwa.

Hortatory discourse resembles expository discourse in that they are
both organised thematically and contain sentences that do not encode
events and are not ordered iconically. Both types of discourse want to414inform, defend a particular course of action, or express the speaker’s
viewpoint. The focus of an expository discourse is directed towards
building a sound argument, while the focus of a hortatory discourse is to
modify the addressee’s thinking or behaviour. Therefore, one will find
that a hortatory discourse is often punctuated at various intervals by valuejudgements, commands or suggestions using hortative forms and
assertions. An expository text deals with arguments and counter
arguments and the author can give a conclusion with or without
exhortation. For example, in the text on problems in childless marriages
(§11.5), the author only states his disapproval of men sending their wives
away in the final paragraph, after he has delineated arguments in favour
and against this behaviour.
Expository discourse deals with reasons, goals, contrasts,
comparisons, conditions linked to consequences, etc. The expression of
complicated ideas leads to the use of complex sentences with subordinate
clauses. An individual clause might be complex as well when e.g. a noun
is modified by embedded phrases or clauses, or when a subordinate clause
is placed in tail position when the speaker fears that the sentence might
not be fully understood.
In (64), the sentence contains a NP modified by a relative clause. It
also has an object clause in tail position. The modified NP is embedded at
two levels. The head of the NP uwr ‘man’ is marked for number by the
phrase final plural demonstrative somokwe. The NP head uwr is modified
by an embedded NP of which the head is sa ‘woman’. This head is
modified by the embedded relative clause ney lopa ma lwak. The
demonstrative seme that precedes the verb phrase establishes a logical
relationship between this clause and the previous one. The object clause in
tail position gives more detail to the idea expressed in the main clause.

‘As a result the men whose wives do not have children are
coming up with different ideas to send their wives away.’
Apart from the fact that the hortatory and the expository text differ in
focus, the discourse types have many similar features. Cohesive
connectives like seyr and sawk (§9.1) which are relatively rare in
descriptive and procedural texts often link or contrast arguments that
support the speaker’s main contentions. Conjunctions encoding reason
(payhokuaw §9.3.3), condition/circumstances (ankin §9.5.3), or logical
consequence (sehe, sokwe, seme §4.4.3) are used often.
In (65), the speaker makes use of reason and conditonal conjunctions
and links his argment to (66) by means of the contrastive connective sawk.
The speaker contrasts the group of men with children and the group of
men without children. All the conjunctions and cohesive markers in (6568) are bolded.

‘But those without children experience hardships, when they
have become old men.’
Subordinate clauses normally precede the main clause, but in (66) the
temporal clause is placed in tail position. As stated before, the tail position
is not used for new information. The speaker simply wants to avoid
ambiguity and adds the subordinate clause to make explicit what could
have been understood from the context already.
Quotes are introduced by the adverbial manner demonstrative senkin
(§4.4.2). The two consecutive arguments in (67-68) are linked by the
cohesive marker seyr ‘and, also’. The marker seyr links entities that are
similar to each other (§9.1.3). In this case it links two quotes that argue in
favour of the same point.

‘Paul’s letter states as follows, “In the present time the

A hortatory text is marked by frequent exhortations. The examples
below are taken from a speech by the local government member exhorting
the people to show up for the village work party the next Monday (§11.6).
The arguments used are a combination of veiled threats and appeals to
parental concern for the well-being of their children. The speaker portrays
himself both as the village leader they need to obey and as the concerned
father figure who looks after everyone’s well-being.
His discourse expresses three times a general command to look well
after the Aid Post. This can be done by an adhortative command (§7.1)
with the clause-final goal marker e as is done in (69).

questions that underline his arguments. Example (70) is a question which,
though answered, is rhetorical in nature. It emphasises the fact that no
alternatives for medical help are available. In (71), the speaker emphasises
this point by listing the potential difficulties the people are likely to
encounter if no action is taken.

It is very rare that the main point of a public hortatory speech is made
in the opening lines and then followed by supporting evidence. A speaker
prefers to pave the way for his main point by mentioning supporting419reasons and arguments first. He anticipates potential resistance to his
opinion or proposal and tries to answer these objections before he comes
to his main point.
The local parliament member in his speech about the Aid Post had as
goal to make the village people show up for community work on Monday.
This point is only made towards the end of the speech (73), after the
benefits of having the Aid Post have been mentioned and negative
scenarios of the village without an Aid Post have been stressed. Even
then, the speaker stays away from a direct command, but rather describes
what should happen when he asks the people to work on the Aid Post.

Personal letters have several features which distinguish them from
other thematically organised texts. They have five components:
a. name of the addressee;
b. introductory greetings;
c. stage setting or introduction to the main point;
d. main point or request;
e. closing, which has the writer’s signature.","[421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433]"
"3.4.1 Numerals and NP order
Numerals follow the head noun of a noun phrase, and agree in class
with the noun they modify. (The twelve noun classes are discussed in
section §3.4.3). The Abau number system is limited in its scope. English
and Tok Pisin numbers are used for numbers above twelve, and often even
for numbers lower than twelve. Traditionally, there was no easy way to
express quantities above 20 or even above 12. The use of higher numbers
has been mainly introduced through the formal school system which is in
English. Abau speakers will therefore use the English forms of the
numerals even if the pronunciation of the numerals is affected by their use
of Tok Pisin and Abau. The use of the loanword numeral apparently
triggers English and Tok Pisin grammatical ordering. When an Abau
numeral is used the numeral will follow the noun as in (41).

Abau numerals are in reasonably frequent use up to five. The numbers
six to twelve are used to a much lesser extent. Above that, the numeral for5520 is sometimes used. Table 18 indicates the various ways numbers from
4-12 as well as 20 can be expressed.

systems’. He says “the latter are used only for direct counting, or
‘mapping’ of a set of objects against some other measuring code. There
are no ‘numerals’ in a tally system, so that one may not receive a reply to56the question ‘how many?’, or find the points of the tally-system qualifying
nouns, as do true numerals. The typical tally-systems of languages of the
New Guinea area are the ‘body-parts’ counting systems.” (Laycock 1975:
219). Later, he mentions Abau as an example of a language which has
both a body-parts tally-system and a numeral system which is quinary (i.e.
has distinct numbers up to 5) (Laycock 1975: 222).
The numbers below have been observed in contexts where they
qualify nouns. This might not have been always the case. Abau speakers
have been observed to think for a short while before they can match
numbers above five with the corresponding Abau number expressions.
The attempt to use Abau number expressions to modify nouns might be
the result of education and numeracy in the English language. It has been
observed that many Abau speakers use English numerals for quantities
above five. Abau numerals are used as the following example from a
written story illustrates:

‘Fish got into (the net) to this degree, five pikes, one catfish
and ten weir fish.’3.4.3 Abau numerals one, two and three
Nouns can be divided into two groups on the basis of their gender
(masculine and feminine). They can also be divided into twelve groups on
the basis of what numeral they occur with. These numerals are in
Aikhenvald’s terminology numeral classifiers (Aikhenvald 2000: 17).
Whereas the gender of a noun is indicated through noun phrase
markers, the numeral class of a noun is determined by the set of numerals
used for 1, 2, and 3. These class concordances are only expressed by the57first three numbers. Numbers above four (see Table 18) can be used to
modify all countable nouns.
The order in which the twelve numeral classes are listed below
follows Laycock and Z’graggen (1975: 745-746). The numeral classifiers
in class 1 to 7 mark relatively large groups of nouns, while the numeral
classifiers in class 8 to 12 can only be used with a small number of nouns.
This is in all likelihood caused by the fact that the numeral classifiers in
class 8 through 12 express many more specifics than only quantity. Not
only their number, but also their grouping (e.g. bundles), or their partition
(e.g. chopped-up parts) can be in focus. In English, grouping words like
flock, bunch, bundle, etc. only occur with a limited number of nouns.
Similarly, it can be assumed that Abau numeral classifiers that express
specifics about the form or compilation of the noun they modify have a
very limited distribution.
Criteria for the different classes are related to humanness, surface,
grouping, dimensionality, and extendedness. Countable nouns which
cannot be classified by their physical appearance are not restricted to one
class; they belong to classes 2, 3 or 4.
The distinction between human and non-human within the numeral
classifiers is observed by all speakers, but young people do not seem to be
aware of all the other distinctions. They tend to overuse class 2 as a
default for nearly all non-human nouns.

Concepts like nothing (55), no-one (56), no way (57) nowhere (58)
etc. are expressed by the combination of an interrogative and a verb
phrase final ley. Resulting sentences are viewed by native speakers as
statements and not as questions. The interrogative precedes the verb
phrase either as an adverbial interrogative (ex. 56) or as part of a NP
(ex. 55). The verb phrase is immediately followed by a clause-final ley
that is analysed as a variant of korey ‘NEG’ (see §7.3.7 for a comparable
analysis of the dynamic modality negation liy … ley).

following three categories: interrogative, emphatic negation and emphatic
declarative. They are a feature of spoken language in direct interaction.
These markers are only used when something needs to be asked or
emphatically be declared or negated. The set of speech utterance markers
consists of the imperfective speech utterance marker o and the perfective
speech utterance markers so, ko and mo. The same set of imperfective and
perfective speech utterance markers mark the three mentioned categories.
The markers only differ in the intonation contour they carry. Specifics for
the three categories are given in Table 44.
The imperfective speech marker o and the perfective speech markers
so, ko and mo occur with the following differing intonations that
determine whether they mark the sentence for interrogative, emphatic
negation or emphatic declarative. (These diacritics are only used in this
grammar write-up but not in the currently accepted orthography.)252

various markers.
These markers have some resemblance in form to the proximal and
distal demonstratives and also to the genitive markers. The proximal
demonstrative is represented by o- (§3.6.2) and so are the imperfective
speech utterance markers. The imperfective often has present tense
reference. This is consistent with the pattern in many languages where
proximal signals cataphoric reference and more distant signals anaphoric
reference (e.g. the table at Dixon 2003:83). However, the perfective
speech utterance markers so, ko and mo do not really match the distal
demonstrative. It should be noted that they are identical in form to the
three genitive markers. They function at different levels though, one
marking embedded noun phrases and the other clauses or even sentences.
A speech utterance is not obligatorily marked with any of the markers
listed in Table 44. Many utterances like (59) can be made that have no
sentence final speech marker.

The interrogative, however, is nearly always marked with a sentence
final speech utterance marker. The use of the interrogative speech marker
is sometimes left out when an adverbial interrogative marker (§7.5.3) is253used in combination with the inchoative marker ley (§5.3.1) and the
intentional marker ey (§5.3.2). This is demonstrated in (60) and (61).

The scope of ma- can be broadened to refer to a further, but different
action by the same person in the same context. The meaning of the prefix
ma- shifts from ‘again’ to ‘also’. The latter use is illustrated in (9) where
ma-me-woro ‘RPT-speak-console’ does not refer to a repeated instance of
the action of consolation, but to a further action of the agent that was
performed as well (i.e. she laughed at the child and then also consoled the
child).

kiy- ‘ACT’. In (9) are two instances of the prefix nuw- ‘INT’. They both
express intensity of action. The prefix kiy- refers to the verb as an actual
event that is or needs to be executed. It is often used with verbs referring
to speech: a certain statement is made, or a question is asked. In (10), the
prefixed verb kiy-a refers to the actual execution of the event of eating.

The prefix non- ‘DU’ is only used in reference to humans. The prefix
is nearly always present on the main verb when the subject of the clause
has dual number. There is an overlap in meaning with non ‘comitative’
(see §3.9.3) since both express the idea of single entities working together.
However, the verbal prefix non- is grammatically quite different from the
NP final marker non. The latter marker does not require or imply dual
number, while the prefix non- always implies dual number.
The prefix non- ‘DU’ contrasts with nak- ‘ACC’ on the features of
humanness and agency. The prefix non- ‘DU’ implies two humans who are
together in an agent role. The prefix nak- ‘ACC’ implies the
accompaniment of a non-human constituent which is not in agent role.
Examples (11) and (12) are part of the same story. The prefix non- in
non-hiy-naw conveys the presence of a human subject with dual number.
The use of nak- in nak-a in (12) expresses a non-human constituent (in
this case sowk ‘sago jelly’) which does not have agent role.","[143, 144, 145]"

When these two rules conflict, it is up to the speaker to choose which
constituent to focus on. In (83), the choice of the speech marker ko can be
defended on the basis of rule 2 and the use of the speech marker so can be
defended on the basis of rule 1. If the speaker wants to focus on the
mother as actor, ko will be selected, if the speaker wants to focus on the
child as patient so will be selected.

In summary, the object NP is the most likely candidate to govern the
number and gender of the sentence final speech marker. Normally, it is the
object NP that precedes the verb phrase, which makes the choice of gender
and number for the speech marker straightforward, since the two rules
agree with each other. In (84), it would grammatically be incorrect to
establish agreement in gender and number between the subject and the
speech marker. (The feminine speech marker ko can only be utilised if the
object NP precedes the subject NP.)

markers
A clause marked by the modal marker ey ‘intention’ or by the modal
marker ley ‘inchoative’ (§5.3) can only be followed by a perfective speech
utterance marker and never by an imperfective speech marker. In (85), ey
‘INT’ necessitates the use of the perfective interrogative speech marker sõ
in spite of the fact that the event referred to is a future event. The reason
for this phenomenon is related to the fact that ey ‘INT’ and ley ‘INCH’ are
clause-final markers. The speech utterance marker is a sentential marker.
The use of the perfective speech marker treats the sentence it marks as a
single event.

intentional marker ey. When deleted, the speech marker follows the VP
and not a clause-final marker. The predication refers to a non-finished
present time event, which means that the imperfective speech marker
needs to be selected as is shown in (87).

‘What are we (or: will we be) scooping with?’7.4.6 Emphatic declarative speech marker with the
addressee
As stated before the perfect speech utterance markers so, ko and mo
are mainly used to mark the interrogative mood, but also to indicate
emphatic negation and emphatic declarative.
The emphatic declarative speech marker can be suffixed with an
addressee morpheme. There are three independent vocatives which are
used to address one or more persons: masculine ara, feminine akwa and
plural ama. Their independent use is exemplified in (88).

From the masculine ara, feminine akwa and plural ama a set of three
addressee suffixes -ra, -kwa, and -ma is derived. The initial a is absorbed264at the juncture when these addressee markers are suffixed to the three
emphatic declarative speech utterance markers so, ko, or mo.
When the three addressee markers are suffixed to the three speech
markers so, ko and mo a total of nine different surface forms result as can
be seen in Table 45.

Alternatives are not only expressed by juxtaposed main clauses.
Alternatives, especially when treated as a non-exhaustive list, can be an
unlimited number of main clauses, which are broken up by the intervening
marker o ‘or’.
Example (24) was taken from a graduation speech where the speaker
explained why not everyone passed the exam. The bolded alternative
marker o ‘or’ separates the two alternatives mentioned. This marker o
occurs between the clauses and is intonationally not part of either clause.
The use of the alternative marker o in oral texts is relatively rare. Like
payhokuaw in the next section, a pause precedes and follows the marker o,
setting it apart from the two clauses it joins.

‘Do not think in your heart that I cheated or that the teachers

influence of Tok Pisin. Its intonation pattern has no counterpart elsewhere.
The vowel is drawn out and often preceded (and sometimes even
followed) by an unusually long pause that might simply be there to give
the speaker sufficient time to formulate the next alternative.
It is noteworthy that the alternative marker o can be added to example
(22) but not to (23). The first example can be thought of as a list that
could be added to with other possible alternatives regarding the one
referent (i.e. the daughter) discussed. The second example has two
referents (i.e. father and son) and the two alternatives given state what
each referent specifically will do. The use of the alternative marker would
be incorrect in such a context.","[370, 371, 372]"
"121.9 Abau culture
CultureThe river is viewed as the maternal uncle (kam). It is treated with
respect, because it gives water to wash and drink and it is a source of
food. The ceremonial washing that takes place in the river after an
extended time of mourning is a very important cultural event. The
cleansing water of the river enables the mourner to return to normal life
again.
Clan ties are strengthened by marriage exchange and by a number of
other customs that involve food exchanges. The most notable among them
is the custom of pig exchange. Many piglets are raised for the benefit of a
member on the maternal side of the family, who lives in expectation of
this gift for many years. The food exchange that takes place when the pig
is eaten is very significant.
ChristianityThe first Christian church workers arrived in the mid-1950s with a
Brethren Church background. Their work in Papua New Guinea was done
under the name CMML. Their main focus was literacy, medical work and
the establishment of village churches. These village churches soon started
to operate under local leadership and were called Christian Brethren
Churches (CBC). Some of the villages further away from the Green River
station have aligned themselves with other churches, e.g. Catholic Church,
Pentecostal Church and ‘Holiness’ Church.
EconomyThe Abau are river people. Their main mode of transport is by canoe.
The vast flat area of swamps, rivers and lakes accounts for their staple of
sago and fish. They can be described as hunters and gatherers, in spite of
the fact that they plant gardens. They tend not to rely heavily on their
gardens, as yearly flooding of the Sepik River often destroys their crops.
The area depends on air transport for most of its fuel and store-food
supplies. Boat transport along the Sepik is possible but slow and
expensive. Normal village life does not come with a lot of expenses with
the notable exception of the necessity to pay for high school fees. People
have tried a number of cash crops (coffee, rubber in the 1980s, and vanilla13more recently) and none of them proved economically viable, due to low
world market prices and the high costs of air transport to the nearest
coastal town Vanimo.
EducationIn the late fifties, CMML (Christian Missions in Many Lands) started
with their first literacy efforts in Tok Pisin and later also in English among
children and adults. Eventually a primary school in English for children
was established at Green River. This was the only school in the Abau area
till 1974. However, in that year the Idam government station was opened
and the Idam primary school was established. Other primary schools were
gradually added: Yabru (1978), Bifro (1980) Ibru (1982).
A few more primary schools were established in the late eighties and
nineties (Mukways, Sowkmayon, Kasiaru, Wauru and Wagu). Many of
these remote schools had their share of problems and a few negative
trends had set in. It became increasingly hard to get teachers for these
isolated village schools. Schools became understaffed or the positions
became filled by local teachers who took more liberty in being absent
from their school duties. Most of these schools (with the exception of
Green River) were too small to enroll a new first grade every year. They
only did so every other year or even less frequently. These developments
had a bad effect on the quality of education. Most children are still
enrolled in schools but the drop-out rate has increased.
A positive development was the establishment of the Green River
High School in the early nineties. This small High School can pride itself
in good academic achievements of its students that got nation-wide
acclamation.
In 1997 and 1998, Papua New Guinea implemented a dramatic
education reform of its school system. The new set-up promotes the use of
the mother tongue which became the primary language of instruction
within the Elementary School. Oral English is introduced in the last and
third year of Elementary Education. After these three years of Elementary
School the children are enrolled in the third year of Primary School.
Unfortunately, these elementary schools were established in only nine of
the 25 villages. The more remote villages missed out and have asked the
Abau Training Centre for continued assistance to run schools in the14vernacular until the provincial education office will establish an
Elementary School in their village.
Anthropological researchWell-documented anthropological research can be found on the site of
The Upper Sepik-Central New Guinea Project (http://www.uscngp.com/
papers). This research group aims “to explore the relationships between
material culture on the one hand, and language, geographical propinquity,
population, subsistence and environment on the other, in two adjacent
regions of Papua New Guinea – the upper Sepik basin and the highlands
of central New Guinea – during a relatively narrow time span before
major impact by foreign cultures.”
Of special interest is the research of Fyfe and Bolton (2010) with
their analysis of associations between string bag variability, language and
geographical distance in the upper Sepik basin and Border Mountains.
Also noteworthy is the well-written collection of Abau legends by Craig
(1980) and various other articles by the same author. Craig (1980: 8-9)
records a number of local legends which suggest that the Abau speakers
originally moved into the language area from further downstream (east)
along the Sepik.","[25, 26, 27, 28]"

relatively few examples of contrastive lexical tone pairs have been
discovered so far”. Laycock and Z’graggen (1975: 744-5) queried the
correctness of Bailey’s claim that Abau was tonal, since it countered a
previous statement by Laycock (1965b) that Abau, Iwam and Wogamusin
are not tonal. Foley cites Bailey’s observations (1986:64). We have found
no evidence of a system of lexical tone or for the tone distinctions on
nouns and verbs that were presented by Bailey (1975: 32-37). The
minimal pairs Bailey listed all proved to be incorrect interpretations, see
Lock (2007: 21-22).
The stress in Abau always occurs word initially. Bailey never
commented on stress. Laycock (1965b) states that stress occurs word
initially, or occurs on the second syllable when the word contains /ə/. As
stated before, the current analysis does not have this central vowel. Six of
the seven examples with /ə/ mentioned by Laycock (1965b:117) are
analysed currently as /o/. These words have the stress on the first syllable
(e.g. hohkwe ‘the two of them’). The phoneme /ə/ in the seventh word is
analysed as /ow/ (low ‘to defecate’).
In defining the syllable we will rely on a basic phonological
assumption, that the same sequential constraints which operate at the
beginning of a word are also operative at the beginning of a syllable, even
if this syllable does not occur word initially. Similarly, the same21sequential constraints which operate at the end of a word should be
operative at the end of a syllable.
The following word initial consonant clusters have been observed.
When they occur word medially, they are analysed as occurring syllable
initially.

long orthography conference was organised in Yabru village which was
attended by educated and influential Abau speakers. The goal was to
determine the orthography of the Abau language on the basis of long word
lists that focused on phonemes in various environments and on particular
contrasts and minimal pairs. It also exposed the conference participants to
the various ways Abau people had spelled in testing situations. See Lock
(1993) for more information on the procedures and the reasons behind this
orthography conference.
Based on the recommendations of this conference, the orthography
follows the phonemic analysis with two exceptions:
1. The phoneme /r/ is represented in the orthography by <r>,<l> and <d>.
The following spelling rules determine the available alternatives:
a. Word initial /r/ is written as <l>.
e.g. /reir/ ‘take out’ is spelled as: <leir>
b. /r/ is written as <d> preceding /n/
e.g. /yorney/ ‘finger’ is spelled as: <yodney>
c. /r/ is written as <r> elsewhere.
e.g. /hror/ ‘the two of us’ is spelled as: <hror>
2. Word initial clusters of a high vowel and a low vowel are written with
an extra word initial semi-vowel that will agree with the high vowel for
the feature [back]. Thus:
a. /#iV/ is written as <yi>V
e.g. /ia/ ‘fire’ is spelled as: <yia>
b. /#uV/ is written as <wu>V
e.g. /ueir/ ‘garden’ is spelled as: <wueir>2.5Word boundaries and stressThe phonological word is defined as a unit with one primary stress. In
Abau, primary stress is associated with the first syllable of the
phonological word. The syllable with primary stress is assigned higher
pitch and intensity than the other syllables. The lowest pitch occurs on the
last syllable.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

It was demonstrated in §6.7 that an Object NP in a clause that has a VP
filled by a motion verb functions as purpose constituent. Similarly, a322constituent that is marked for object indicates purpose, if the main clause
has a verb phrase filled by a motion verb. In (44), the constituent in tail
position is a NP with an embedded clause (bolded) that modifies the
masculine head om-huok. The NP final sehe agrees with the head of the NP
in gender and number.

Apart from reason, cause and purpose, contents or manner can also be
expressed by a subordinate clause with the assistance of the manner
adverb senkin.
A main clause with the manner adverb senkin expresses the concept of
manner or contents. Additional information about the manner or contents
can be given by an optional constituent in tail position. The tail position
can be formed in three possible ways:
a. a relative clause with a deleted head, followed by a final senkin;
b. a relative clause with a deleted head, followed by a final senkin
plus the same verb repeated that occurred in the main clause;
c. a relative clause with a deleted head.
The most common form is to simply mark the clause with senkin,
which corresponds with the adverbial senkin in the main clause, as is
demonstrated in (45).","[333, 334, 335, 336]"
"7.4.2 Usage of imperfective speech marker o
The imperfective speech marker, which overlaps with the present,
habitual and future is not differentiated for gender and number. Like the
perfective speech markers it exhibits various intonation contours that can
give the clause the modal force of emphatic negation, interrogative, or
emphatic affirmative. This marker can only be used in verbal sentences.
The intonation contour for the imperfective speech markers for these
three categories is not identical to the intonation contour for the perfective
speech markers. The perfective and imperfective markers agree for the
features of level pitch and falling pitch. The major difference is the pitch
height. The intonation contour for the imperfective exhibits for all three
categories a higher onset. E.g. the glide over the interrogative o starts and
ends at a higher pitch than the glide over the interrogative speech markers
so, ko and mo. The markers for the emphatic negation and the emphatic
declarative have a level intonation contour. The relative pitch height for
the imperfective is higher than for the corresponding imperfective
markers. In an attempt not to overload the examples with too many
diacritics I have not marked this difference in pitch height between the
perfective and imperfective.
The intonation contour associated with sentences encoding the
imperfective speech markers distinguishes the interrogative (72), the
negative (73), and the emphatic declarative (74).
In (72), the imperfective interrogative speech utterance marker o
exhibits a glide that starts at a high level falling to mid.",[270]

The following morphophonemic rules are optional. They are
frequently applied but not obligatory. Both base forms and
morphophonemically derived forms exist side by side. The two optional
rules are:
Rule C: o o e / __Ce#
Rule D: o o a / __Ca# (in which C=consonant)
(8) none ‘nose’ is used interchangeably with nene
kora ‘direct speech, addressive’ is used interchangeably with
kara
hrome ‘1PL.OBJ’ is used interchangeably with hreme
In (8), hrome is derived from hrom ‘1PL.SUB’. It can take the genitive
suffix -o, or the objective suffix -e. When suffixed with the front vowel -e
the optional vowel harmony Rule C can change hrome into hreme.
Table 10 shows the application of morphophonemic Rule C. The last
column shows the base forms and the second-last column shows the
morphophonemically derived forms.

"7.5.1 The interrogative as head of the noun phrase
The interrogative is the head of the noun phrase and can be marked
syntactically for subject and object. In some environments it can also be
marked by a postpositional marker.
The following interrogative pronouns have been observed that can
function as head of the NP:
a. Human interrogatives (seeking to identify from an open group)
b. Non-human interrogatives (seeking to identify from an open
group)
c. Location interrogatives (seeking to identify location or name).
7.5.1.1 Human interrogative functioning as head of the NP
The human interrogative is used for any living being treated as a
‘person’, including humans, spirits and animals behaving like humans.
They are not differentiated for gender or number on the interrogative word
itself. The human interrogative is used to select from an open group. (This
in contrast to the interrogative set represented by pohiy, which is used to272seek the identity of an entity from a closed group of potential
alternatives.)

The analysis of so as a human marker is made with some hesitation,
because this distinction is not found elsewhere. Animate and inanimate
agents can often be referred to by the same referential markers (e.g.
compare the use of subject pronoun in §3.7.1). In spite of this hesitation
on the correct meaning of the morpheme so-, it is clear that the usage of
this particular interrogative is limited to human beings.
Table 47 shows the human interrogative in various functions. The
human interrogative is the head of the NP when it functions as subject or
object. The human interrogative can also precede the head noun of the NP.
In that position it should be analysed as either a modifier interrogative
(see §7.5.2) or a genitive interrogative.

1.1 Location and population
Abau is a language spoken by more than 7000 people in Sandaun
(formerly West Sepik) Province, Papua New Guinea (see map 1). The
language area consists of the villages to the immediate east and west of
the Green River Station, as well as the villages along the Sepik River and
its tributaries, starting at the border with Indonesian Papua (the Indonesian
province of Papua, formerly Irian Jaya) all the way down to the border
with the East Sepik. The area depends mainly on air transport for supplies,
since there are no roads to connect the Green River Area with the coast
and transport via the Sepik River has proven to be troublesome.
MAP 1: THE ABAU AREA WITHIN PNG121.2 Language name
The language name Abau means infertile land. It is any area of open
grassy land without trees that cannot be used for food gardens. The more
than 1 kilometre long Green River Airstrip was built on such land. The
local people continued to refer to the area as Abau, and consequently the
Green River Station Area with its airstrip became known as Abau. The
name eventually transferred to the people group and the language. (The
word Abau is also used adverbially to indicate barrenness in a woman.
When following the word makwey ‘head’ it means bald.)1.3 Affiliation and earlier studies
In Wurm’s classification system (Laycock 1973; Laycock and
Z’graggen 1975; Wurm 1982), Abau is classified as an isolate at the
lowest level within the Upper Sepik Stock, Upper Sepik Super-stock,
Sepik sub-phylum, Sepik-Ramu phylum.
More recent research by Foley (2005) and Ross (2005) regards Abau
as a member of the Sepik family, related to other languages of the upper
and middle Sepik river valley, and the Sepik hill country, but not to the
languages of the Lower Sepik or Ramu families.
There have been several previous attempts at describing the Abau
language, but little published research. Wordlists were collected by patrol
officers F.R. Cawley (1919) and N.J. Cavanagh (1961); Cawley published
his wordlists in several Papua Annual Reports between 1917 and the
1930s. Kay Liddle, who was the missionary at Green River in 1960-62 for
Christian Missions in Many Lands (CMML), filled seven notebooks with
texts, typical constructions, a phonemic statement and the beginnings of a
dictionary. However this material has never been published. 1
Three linguistic surveys of the language have been published. Loving
and Bass (1964) conducted a survey on behalf of the Australian
administration; they refer to the language as “Green River”, and note that
if administrative officers at Green River station learned the language, they
would be able to communicate with 3/5 of their administrative area. The
second was conducted by Donald Laycock of Australian National
University, who published a brief wordlist (Laycock 1965a) and
1Information compiled from Loving and Bass (1964); Laycock (1973); Carrington (1996).","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"5.1.1 Other features of the VP final intonation
When one compares the intonation contour over the two syllable verb
lokin ‘hit’ in (5) and (6), the contrast between imperfective and perfective
stands out because of the final syllable. But it should be noted that there is
also a smaller difference in the pitch on the onset of the first syllable of
lokin. It is somewhat more salient and higher in (5) than in (6). (The
contrast is symbolised by markings over the initial vowel of the verb,
whereby ьrepresents a higher onset than ы)
The difference in pitch might be simply a natural tone adjustment in
anticipation of the more contrastive pitch difference on the final syllable.
In this paper, only the verb phrase final pitch on the final syllable is
marked in those examples where the distinction between perfective and
imperfective is relevant.

Clause-final markers which distinguish morphologically between
perfective and imperfective are discussed in §7. A number of other clausefinal markers which have their own distinct intonation contours do not
distinguish between perfective and imperfective. In §7.1 and §7.2 the
objective marker e in imperatives and the future markers a, ane and aney
are discussed. Another set of clause-final modal markers that express166other aspects like inchoative, intention, desirability and dubitative are
discussed in §5.3. All these markers in §7 and §5.3 follow the verb phrase
and have their own distinctive intonation contours which neutralise any
contrastive intonation that might have been on the final syllable of the
verb phrase.
A quick overview of the clause-final markers which distinguish
morphologically between perfective and imperfective is given in Table 39
below. These clause-final markers follow the VP. Many of these markers
are only distinguished in modality by intonation. Further discussion and
examples, including a description of what intonation contours the
diacritics stand for, can be found in the sections as indicated in the table.

The deontic modal markers kwa, kwaw, and ka express deontic
modality, which includes a wide semantic range: hortative, permissive,
and imperative. In example (7), kwa marks an imperative. Verb phrases
marked by the hortative marker kwa always display perfective aspect. (In
all the examples in chapter 5, the relevant VP is always underlined and the
marker under discussion is bolded.)167(7) Hunkwe

Speakers use kwaw ‘HOR.RSTR’ to make their command or permission
the exclusive, single issue that needs to be focused on. It is used in
contexts where the purpose is to make an earnest request rather than give
a command. The underlying form consists of the hortative marker kwa and
the restrictive marker -aw.","[179, 180, 181]"

3.4.4.3 Numeral one as quantifier
The numeral one often has the function of introducing new
participants, but it can also simply be a quantifier. The numeral one has a
quantifying function when the numeral is suffixed by -aw ‘restrictive’ as
in (62). The numeral one can be suffixed twice in a row by the suffix -aw.
The second suffix -aw adds emphasis (see §3.1.4). It is best to interpret
prueyn-aw as ‘one’ or ‘just one’ and preyn-aw-aw as ‘only one’.

The numeral one also has a quantifying function when it follows a
topicalised NP as in (63). The numeral is not part of the topicalised noun
phrase wik hokwe. The numeral kamon is part of the non-topicalised part
of this clause.

The concept of ‘one by one’ is expressed by a repetition of the
numeral one, whereby the last numeral is suffixed by -aw ‘restrictive’. If it65is in regard to people the expression is prueyn prueyn-aw. If it refers to
objects like coconuts, the expression is kamon kamon-aw.

A shift is taking place in the use of numeral classifiers at the expense
of the classes 3 to 12. Many tend to use class 2 numerals to modify all
non-human nouns. Table 20 gives examples of differing observed usages
of the numerals by speakers of the language. The second column gives
‘non-standard’ usage observed in younger speakers.

and numeral class of nouns
As stated before, the gender of a noun is in large part determined by
its physical form and may actually be assigned a different gender if its
physical appearance is sufficiently different (see §3.3). The choice of the
Abau numeral is also in many cases determined by the physical form of
the noun it modifies and the choice of the numeral classifier can be66changed if the form of the object denoted by the noun changes. It should
be noted that nouns belonging to the same class do not automatically have
the same gender, e.g.:
uwr ‘man’ (masc)
sa ‘woman’ (fem)
- class 1 nouns.
a ‘house’ (masc)
yeyn ‘moon’ (fem)
- class 2 nouns.
now-ho ‘stick’ (masc) youk ‘paddle’ (fem) - class 5 nouns.
Table 21 below lists a number of nouns which are modified by one of
the twelve classes of numerals. For each noun the gender is given. Most
nouns do not have inherent gender and may be given a variety of numeral
classifiers depending on the feature being highlighted. Nouns denote
entities which can have many different physical forms and appearances
which impact the selection of the numeral classifier and gender
assignment. Classes 1 to 5 are truly mixed for gender. Classes 6 to 12
seem to stick to one gender only.
A summary of the gender and numeral class assignment of nouns:
Class 1, which represents human beings, is naturally represented by
both genders.
Class 2 is the default class; not surprisingly, it also has mixed gender.
Class 3 is represented by small, round, three-dimensional items.
Because of the three-dimensional factor it attracts mostly
masculine objects. However, if the feature roundness is regarded
as more prominent, the nouns are assigned feminine gender e.g.
payr ‘a rather round fish’, yeyn ‘moon’.
Class 4 is partly characterised by the feature flat surface. This feature
is also characteristic for feminine nouns. The ‘experience’ nouns
are frequently feminine, though not always, e.g. prawk ‘scent’ is
masculine. The class four numeral is also used for masculine
nouns like owk ‘string bag’ and ine-maku ‘forehead’. The
selection of masculine gender gives reason to believe that another
determining factor is in play than the feature flat surface. It is
unclear though what this category could be.
Class 5 numerals are characterised by length. As stated before the
feature extendedness is a mark of masculine nouns as contrasted
with the feature flat surface which relates to feminine nouns. The
gender of an object with both features (e.g. youk ‘paddle’, pisu
‘machete’, ku ‘axe’) is generally determined by the feature flat67surface. However, in determining numeral class, the feature
extendedness is more prominent; thus words like youk ‘paddle’,
pisu ‘machete’ and ku ‘axe’ do not come under class 4 but under
class 5.
Class 6 is a group of solely masculine nouns that represent
geographical entities. Feminine geographical entities like howk
‘lake’ and iwa ‘swamp’ are not part of this class.
Class 7 is a group of solely feminine nouns which are characterised
by two-dimensionality.
As stated above, the numeral classifiers of classes 8 to 12 mark a very
restricted number of nouns. It is noteworthy that they are all masculine
nouns. In the present data corpus, only two members have been observed
for classes 8 and 10. Members of classes 9, 11 and 12 all refer to long
objects, and are therefore masculine.

commented on and illustrations of alternative devices to express
descriptive notions are given. The contrast between nouns and adjectival
modifiers is discussed.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"
"3.5.1 The extent of the use of adjectival constructions
The number of adjectives is very low. It covers in broad strokes the
range of sizes (e.g. aiopey ‘big’, sowpwareney ‘small’, mei ‘long’, hiymiy
‘tall’, etc.), age (e.g. naw ‘old’, iwon ‘young’ or ‘new’) and various
quality indications (piap ‘bad’, yaprue ‘good’,’ ihey ‘excellent’).
Colours are not really adjectives but are descriptive of other items that
reflect that particular colour, e.g. or ‘black ‘ also means ‘burnt wood’. Ou
‘red’ is also used in compound nouns that contain reddish colours, e.g.
yoh-ou ‘ripe banana’, naw-ou ‘reddish sago’. (These words exhibit the
pitch pattern that is distinctive for compound nouns, §3.2.2.) Other colour
terms are formed with the help of the NP marker eyn ‘similar’, e.g.
woukmow-si eyn ‘similar to the excrement of a dove’ (= greenish) or
wouknow-hu eyn ‘similar to the juice of ginger (= yellowish)’. The origin
of weys ‘white’ is not really known. It can be used in compound nouns
ohi-weys ‘skin-white (= white person)’ or pekney-weys ‘spotless entitywhite (= pristine white)’.
Many concepts which are expressed by adjectives in English are
expressed in Abau by a combination of a noun and a verb or a noun with
the comitative marker non, as illustrated in (65):
(65) Hiykwe
iha lopa.

3S.M-TOP things excellent-INTF CMT

restrictive marker within the NP
Nouns and adjectives are both structurally distinct from verbs as they
cannot be affixed by any of the verbal affixes listed in §4.2.1, Table 33.
Structurally nouns are not different from modifiers. Both host similar
affixes like -ar ‘intensifier’ and -aw ‘restrictive’. See examples (20) and
(21).
These markers can also be used with adjectives, as is illustrated
below.
In (66), the intensifier -ar is affixed to a temporal noun paraw and the
adjective ihey (which is part of a NP).

by respectively -ar and -aw.","[83, 84]"
"8.2Sentence structureDik’s language-independent pattern-schema can be applied to the
Abau sentence structure. His basic schema is: THEME, PREDICATION,
TAIL (Dik 1980: 15).
The same schema expressed with more detail (Dik 1980: 20)
P2, P1 (V) S (V) O (V), P3
This can be adopted for the Abau language to: P2 , P1 S O V , P3
The THEME is expressed by the left-dislocated P2 position and the
TAIL by the right-dislocated P3 position. The PREDICATION is everything293in between. In this schema, S and O stand for the neutral or unmarked
positions of Subject and Object. The V indicates the position of the verb
phrase. P1, P2, and P3 indicate special positions used for special purposes,
and the commas stand for breaks in the intonation. P1 is the clause
internal topic, the P2 position is used for elements which are leftdislocated, i.e. they are outside the intonational boundaries of the clause
(cf. Dooley and Levinsohn 2001: 67-69) and the P3 is the right-dislocated
constituent or tail.
Dik (1980: 16) defines THEME and TAIL as follows:
The theme specifies the universe of discourse with respect
to which the subsequent predication is presented as
relevant.
The tail is defined as an “afterthought” to the predication,
information meant to clarify or modify it.
Dik gives an English example that follows the schema THEME,
PREDICATION, TAIL.
(1) Theme (P2)
Predicate (P1 S O V)
Tail (P3)
As for my brother, he never saw her again, the poor child.
He adds that in certain languages, constructions like this may be
strongly marked or even at the fringe of grammaticality, whereas in other
languages, they may almost represent the usual way of constructing a
sentence. He also states that the theme will very often be some term
presented in “absolute” form, i.e. without any specified semantic or
syntactic function (1980:16).
As for the predication marked by P1 S O V, Dik (1980:20-21) states
the following:
The positions marked by S, V and O are called “pattern
positions” for Subj, Verb and Obj. These are the positions
where constituents of this type end up if they have not
been brought into P1 by the rules determining the use of
this special initial position.
Dik further comments about the P1 position that “either Topic or
Focus, or both will often favour the initial position in the clause, if this is
available.” In Abau, the P1 position is always a topicalised constituent and
never belongs to the comment part of the sentence.","[306, 307]"

"3.8.1 Subject demonstrative NP marker
As was shown in §0, a NP can be marked as subject by the NP subject
markers hiy, hok, hoh and hom. The NP subject markers can also be given
demonstrative force as is shown in Table 25. The basic forms of the
subject demonstrative NP markers are similar to the subject pronoun NP
markers dealt with in §0, differing only in the addition of the distal or
proximal demonstrative prefix so- or o-.

with the topic marker -kwe. Also, in contrast to the subject pronoun NP
markers, subject demonstrative NP markers cannot function by themselves
as the head of the NP.
The subject demonstrative is used when the entity it marks has agent
role and needs to be distinguished from other known alternatives.
In (98), sohok ‘DDEM-3S.F’ tags the bolded NP as the subject of its
clause.

‘She tried in vain to lift up (the turtle) and put it in the canoe,
but that (specific) turtle ran away.’
In (99), the second bolded NP is marked by the demonstrative subject
marker sohom. The first bolded NP is not marked by a syntactic
demonstrative NP marker, but by a demonstrative NP marker (sokukwe)
which only signals its pragmatic function.

Ukarumpa, Papua New GuineaPapers in the series Data Papers on Papua New Guinea Languages express the
authors’ knowledge at the time of writing. They normally do not provide a
comprehensive treatment of the topic and may contain analyses which will be
modified at a later stage. However, given the large number of undescribed languages
in Papua New Guinea, SIL-PNG feels that it is appropriate to make these research

‘It was done accordingly, the two of them did so.’9.3Coordination of clausesRelationships between clauses are either coordinate or subordinate.
Section §9.3 details coordinate relationships and §9.4 deals with
subordinate main clausal relationships. Subordinate clauses that are
embedded in NPs or function as a nominal complement are detailed in
§6.6. They are not included in this discussion.
Coordination in sentences is indicated by mostly two and sometimes
more juxtaposed clauses. These clauses have a similar intonation pattern
and could be interchanged without any change in intonation pattern or356grammatical features. The linking device between these juxtaposed
clauses is often only a pause, sometimes it is a marker, which can be
deleted. (This is in sharp contrast with the features of a subordinated
clause which has obligatory clause-final marking and exhibits a clausefinal intonation that differs greatly from the main clause’s intonation.)
Coordinate clauses do not have a clause-final marker bound
intonationally to the clause. If a marker occurs, it is separated from the
clauses it intervenes by pauses. (The pause preceding the marker is
normally longer than the pause following.)
Coordinate clauses are constructed as follows:
a. Coordinate clauses which are juxtaposed with no marking
(§9.3.1).
b. Alternative clauses which are broken up by the intervening
alternative marker o ‘or’ (§9.3.2).
c. Reason clauses which are broken up by the intervening
interrogative payhokuaw ‘why/because’ (§9.3.3).","[368, 369, 370]"
"8.1Defining topicTopic or givenness (which often implies definiteness) in Abau is
marked by -kwe and refers to all information that the speaker assumes is
present or readily accessible in the addressee’s consciousness. Chafe
(1976:30) defines givenness and the problems related to this choice of
terminology this way.
Given (or old) information is that knowledge which the
speaker assumes to be in the consciousness of the
addressee at the time of the utterance. So-called new
291292information is what the speaker assumes he is introducing
into the addressee’s consciousness by what he says. The
terminology has been and continues to be misleading to
linguists and psychologists who use it. Calling something
‘old information’ suggests it is ‘what the listener is
expected to know already’ and ‘new information’ is ‘what
the listener is not expected to know already,’ something
that is being introduced into the addressee’s knowledge
for the first time… But a speaker who says ‘I saw your
father yesterday’ is unlikely to assume that the addressee
had no previous knowledge of his father, even though by
the usual criteria your father would be considered new
information. The point is that the speaker has assumed
that the addressee was not thinking about his father at the
moment. Terms like ‘already activated’ and ‘newly
activated’ would convey this distinction more accurately,
but are awkward; we will probably have to live with the
terms ‘given’ (or ‘old’) and ‘new’.
In Abau, the topic marker -kwe marks information that the speaker
presents as background information, whether or not the addressee has
ready access to it. Constituents marked by the topic marker -kwe occur
sentence initially. The topicalised constituents form together the setting or
the background against which the rest of the predication is asserted. This
topic part sets the stage for the rest of the predication. Participants and
props are mentioned as part of this stage setting. The comment part of the
sentence expresses new information.","[305, 306]"

contains further clarification for the chosen label. The addressive (ADDR)
is marked.

"10.1.1 Introduction to discourse
Introductions often convey background or known information, so it is
not surprising that introductions in discourses are generously sprinkled
with topic markers.
Example (1) is taken from the introduction of a letter (§11.7). It
consists of two clauses separated by a comma. Both clauses have their383384own topic and comment part. The constituents of the topic part of each
clause have been marked by P1 and P2. The remaining part of each clause
is marked comment.

a. acknowledgement of the addressee(s);
b. the speaker’s self-identification;
c. an introduction to the contents to be presented;
d. a reference to the context in which the message is
communicated.
Example (2) above constitutes an introduction to the contents of an
expository text. The introduction also contains a reference to the context
in which the message is communicated enekwei enkin ohokwe ‘this
present time’. The addressees’ and the speaker’s identification have been
combined in the word hromkwe ‘we’.
Example (3) is taken from a procedural text (§11.3). The addressee
hunkwe ‘you’ is acknowledged and an introduction in regard to the
message is given (how to build a house).

Example (4) is taken from the story of “The two brothers” (§11.1.1).
The acknowledgement of the addressee and the identification of the
speaker are collapsed in the pronoun hromkwe (we). This introduction
references both the content (i.e. story of the two brothers) and the context
within which it is communicated (which includes speaker and listeners,
and also the temporal deictic centre of the current moment, when the story
is being told).","[397, 398, 399]"

The main point of hortatory and expository texts, and also letters, is
normally not revealed in the introduction, and not even early in the body
of the text. The main point of these three text types is often subjective and
might be controversial. The speaker tries to anticipate and overcome
potential resistance with introductory observations and statements. Only
after stating these presuppositions will the speaker make his main point.
(Examples are given in the sections dealing with hortatory and expository
texts, and letters.)
This is not the case with procedural and descriptive texts, since their
contents are mostly non-controversial and neutral. The theme of the text is
therefore often mentioned in the introduction. The topic of procedural
texts and descriptive texts can often be contained in a noun phrase or short
clause. See (3) and (5).
Example (5) is taken from a descriptive text (§11.4) which was
produced as a written text. The author gave it a title consisting of one nontopicalised NP that immediately relays the theme of the descriptive text.
The title is sufficient introduction, so the description of the topic starts
immediately in the next sentence. This is realised by a clause formed with
the stative verb lwak ‘be’.

The introduction to the content in time-iconic ordered texts often
takes the form of
a. a temporal (nearly always) or spatial setting, or
b. an introduction of the principal participants.
Example (6) is taken from a non-fiction narrative which was produced
as a written text. The time setting and the participants are introduced as
background information and are therefore topicalised. The first line
functions as an introduction to the story, but it also starts the story line.
The second sentence moves the story line further along, which is
exemplified by the fact that there is only one short topicalised constituent
in the topic part of the clause versus various constituents in the long
comment part of the sentence.

‘One time Peni and Jon went out during the night. The two of

is framed with the stative verb lwak which is an indicator of background
information. Two topicalised NPs give the setting for the comment that is
expressed by the comment part of the first sentence. It is important to note
that in the second sentence the participant ohi-weys prueyn ‘a white
person’ is not introduced as background information. The second sentence
has no topicalised constituents and the newly introduced participant is
marked for subject. This is a clear indication that the story line has
changed from background to foreground and that this sentence points
towards a climactic event within the story line.

An introduction to the contents of a thematically oriented text is
usually done in the very beginning of the text with a clearly stated
reference to the global theme. In (8) and (9), the author introduces the
theme for the whole discourse in the opening sentence and then continues
to give details related to this theme.","[399, 400, 401, 402]"
"3.11.1 Zero marking as a result of noun incorporation
Zero marking on nouns can partly be explained by the occurrence of
noun incorporation. Mithun (1984:848-9) states:
Compounding is done for a reason. Some entity,
quality, or activity is recognised sufficiently often to
be considered name-worthy in its own right. … Such
compounding has a significant effect on the role of
the N involved. In He is off berry-picking, the word
berry does not refer to a specific berry, nor to a
particular bushful of berries: it qualifies the V,
describing the type of picking in progress. Because it
does not refer, it is not marked for definiteness or
number.
Noun incorporation in Abau is indicated by the juxtaposition of an
unmarked object NP with a verb. As Mithun stated the noun is indeed “not
marked for definiteness or number” and occurs without any object
marking that is normally expected for nouns having patient role. In spite115of the close relationship between the unmarked noun and the verb it
precedes, the Abau noun does not become part of the verb phrase as is
further explained below.
Noun phrases that are frequently zero marked are incorporated nouns
acting as patient. These nouns do not need to be recognised as definite,
unique entities, since the activity the patient is involved in is in focus,
rather than the patient itself. In (164), the nouns naw ‘sago’ and yayh
‘song’ do not need to be recognised as definite, unique entities. The focus
is on the activity that is expressed by the noun in combination with the
verb phrase (‘sago making’ and ‘sing-sing dancing’).

‘After we did sago-scraping, we did song-drumming (= after
we scraped sago, we sang/danced songs).’
In (165), hope ‘tobacco’ and loum ‘burn’ form the general activity
‘smoking’.

father 3S.M-TOP tobacco burn
‘Father is smoking tobacco.’
In (166), the N V construction wueir meio can be glossed ‘garden
working’. This construction specifies the type of work, namely garden
work; it does not refer to a specific garden. Therefore the noun wueir is
not marked as the object of the clause. In the second clause, the noun
phrase wueir-aiai senkin senkin (various kinds of garden produce) is
marked by the plural objective pronominal marker me, because it refers to
a specific activity in a specified location.

combines with the verb to specify a generic activity. However, in (168),
yayh ‘song’ refers to identifiable songs which were practised. Therefore
the noun phrase is marked as the object of the clause.

Noun incorporation in Abau is marked by the absence of the object
marker on the NP. The noun is placed as close as possible to the verb
phrase. However, modal and negation markers and interrogatives can
intervene between the noun and the verb phrase. In other words, the noun
and the verb do not combine into a single word, as in the English example
‘berry-picking’ above. In (170), the noun is separated from the verb
phrase by a negation marker, and in (171) by an interrogative.

In spite of the fact that modal markers and interrogatives may
intervene between a zero marked noun and the verb phrase, Abau117recognises a form of noun incorporation that is manifested by NPs that are
not marked and consist of a single noun. Table 32 gives a number of
examples of noun incorporation that occur so frequently that they behave
as formulaic expressions in Abau. Noun incorporation accounts for most
of the zero marking on noun phrases.

Above it was stated that noun incorporation is restricted to unmarked
NPs that consist of one single noun. NPs consisting of more than one
member can occur with zero marking on the NP. They are left-located and
occur even sentence initial. This left dislocation is normally reserved for
all topicalised NPs. Sentence-initial NPs with zero marking are rather rare
and therefore noteworthy.","[128, 129, 130, 131]"

supply. For example, su piron ‘one coconut’ must refer to the whole
coconut palm and not to just the fruit, as the numeral piron indicates the
feature extendedness. In contrast su kamon ‘one coconut’ is likely to be
used when one wants to refer to a single coconut fruit, since the class 2
numeral kamon does not indicate the feature extendedness.
A noun can be marked by different numeral classifiers on the basis of
different appearance or grouping. The noun pey ‘sugarcane’ can be
marked by four different classes of numeral sets:5It is unclear where the final -m in sirom originated from. The numerals seys and sompri
might have sireys and sirompri as underlying forms.","[71, 72]"
"401Examples (32-34) are part of one text. The first two examples give the
needed background information to understand the plot of the story and the
last example (34) describes the beginning of the crisis. In (32), the first
participant how kamon aiopey ‘a certain big taro’ is introduced with a
topic marker and so is the next participant uwrsa homkwe ‘the people’ in
(33). The next NP how aiopey hay sohokwe ‘that big taro’ is also
topicalised and although it has the semantic role of patient it is not marked
for object. This demonstrates that (32) and (33) contain basically
background information that helps the build-up of events for the plot of
the story. All topic markers are bolded.

Example (34) does not contain any topicalised constituents and this
signals the sentence as foreground and even climactic. Temporal
references are often topic-marked and therefore the fact that the temporal
reference enekwei kamon ‘a certain day’ has no topic marking indicates
the speaker’s intent to highlight the event described in (34) as foreground.
This is also illustrated by the fact that the agent sa sokruan prueyn hok ‘a
certain young woman’ is introduced as a new participant without topic
marking. (See §8.7.1 on introduction of new participants.)402(34) Sawk enekwei kamon, sa-sokruan

The next short story (35-41) displays: (1) an introduction; (2) a plot;
and (3) a conclusion.
(1) Introduction: Background of the main character Keno is given.
The fact that he never shot a pig is mentioned as necessary background
information. It is marked with the negation marker lopa which
nominalises the clause. (All topic markers are bolded.)

‘A long time ago there was a boy in a certain place. His name

(2a) Plot: Build-up to the crisis or challenge. The information given
in the introduction about the main character proves to be a source of
derision that needs to be faced. The main character does not agree with the
opinion of the other villagers about his hunting abilities. These facts
establish the challenge. The storyline is moving from backgrounded
information to foregrounded information. This is displayed in (36) by the
use of direct speech and also by the use of the non-topicalised pronoun ha.
The answer given by the main character is a clause without any
topicalised constituent which is an indicator of foregrounded text.

(2b) Plot: Handling of the challenge. The clause-initial temporal noun
phrase marked by the numeral enekwei kamon hokwe (a certain day/time)
points towards a new paragraph. It describes the manner in which the
main character handles the challenge before him.

not topicalised is a clear indication that this is foregrounded text. These
lines are part of the climax of the story.

‘Not long (after that) Keno went back to see. He said, “OK,

In (39-40), the plot further develops with the help of the marker
seseyn ‘done accordingly’ which makes the transition from planned action
to executed action. The subject hiy ‘3S.SUB’ is occurs three times in (3940) without topicalisation. Twice that is the result of the fact that it is
obligatorily not topicalised because it occurs in a subordinate temporal
clause. The subject hiy ‘3S.SUB’ occurs once (underlined) in the main
clause. In that environment the absence of topicalisation is an indication
that the subject is part of foregrounded text. In (40), the NP uwrsa homkwe
is topicalised, which is an indication that the story line has reached a less
climactic part of the story.

Procedural texts often have an introduction and a conclusion, but they
both can be very short. The ‘plot’ within a procedural text is concerned
with the description of sequenced or logical steps that will enable
someone to correctly perform an action. Procedural texts lack the
emotions, conflict and participant cast of a narrative text, because
procedural texts are in general not concerned with behaviour of people,
but on how particular activities need to be performed. The actor(s) in a
procedural text can be nameless or only be identified according to role.
Time is normally not indicated in absolute terms, since procedural
texts do not focus on the description of past or current events. The focus is
to give instruction on the right and logical sequence of actions related to a
specific context. Imperfective aspect is widely used in procedural texts.
Examples (42-50) are taken from the procedural text ‘House building’
(§11.3). The bolded words and phrases are characteristic of how sequence
is marked in procedural texts.
If a procedural text is produced in written form it might be supplied
with a name. This is often just a non topicalised NP. In (42), the head of
the NP is modified by the embedded clause a meio.
(42) A
meio yor.
a
meio yor
house work way
‘The way of house building.’
In (43), the text starts with an introduction where the author identifies
himself in combination with the theme that he will discuss. As in many
procedural texts, this introduction is very short and in (44), the author
immediately goes ahead to delineate the various steps of house building.

wants to undertake the task of house building.","[414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420]"

The first number shows the number of words that are phonemically
identical. The second number after the slash indicates the number of
words that are different but can be still regarded as cognate. The total of
the two numbers should be the same as the cognate figure in the table
above. The table below shows that the number of identical words between
Yabru and Wagu is only 64% and that a third of the Wagu vocabulary
consists of words that have at least one different vowel or consonant than
their Yabru counterparts. This fact logically has a negative effect on the
ease of communication between Yabru and Wagu speakers.","[17, 18]"

The object demonstratives are more often used adverbially than
attributively. When used adverbially, one of the three distal demonstrative
object markers (sehe, sokwe or seme) occurs as the only member of a
phrase constituent immediately preceding the verb phrase. The
demonstrative object marker refers to a previous clause or sentence. The
distal object demonstrative encodes a relationship of logical consequence
between the clause it occurs in and the clause or sentence to which it
anaphorically refers.
A demonstrative object marker can only mark a relationship of logical
consequence when it is used adverbially. Two conditions need to be met:
a. the demonstrative marker immediately precedes the verb phrase;
b. the demonstrative marker is the only constituent within the
phrase. If it is part of a noun phrase it cannot anaphorically refer
to a clause or sentence. (E.g. sehe in (60) is not used adverbially
but attributively because it is part of a NP.)
The choice of the gender or number of the adverbial demonstrative
depends on the gender and number of the most prominent noun phrase
that is involved in the effects of the causal relationship. In most cases this
is the constituent who experiences the effects of the action. This choice,
however, is arbitrary and the speaker may choose to establish agreement
with the agent rather than the patient. See example (63).","[171, 172]"

marked as the object of the clause, but rather as a sentential topic that will

and are therefore placed clause-initially and topicalised. They are only
found in the comment part of the clause if the temporal or the locative is
treated as new information.
In (44), the NP enekwei kamon hokwe ‘one day’ is treated as
background information within the sentence where it occurs. Therefore it
is not marked syntactically or semantically, only pragmatically. The NP
John hiykwe ‘John 3S.M.SUB-TOP’ is a topicalised subject. The object is
syntactically marked by me but is not topicalised. The incorporated noun
yokun ‘theft’ that precedes the verb phrase is by definition not marked for

eat6.5.2 Pragmatic and syntactic marking on NPs consisting
of a personal pronoun
It needs to be noted again that NPs with a noun as head can be marked
in more diverse ways than NPs that consist only of a personal pronoun.
NPs which have a noun as head are marked by a separate final noun phrase
marker while NPs that consist only of a personal pronoun often do not
have such a separate NP marker. For the latter group syntactic information
is in most cases not marked by a separate marker, but carried by the
personal pronoun itself.
Secondly, there is a wide range of NP final markers for NPs with a
noun as the head of the NP. These markers give the NP a pragmatic role, or
a syntactic role, or both. The range of options of NP markers for NPs that
have only a personal pronoun as head is more limited. Table 43 gives an
overview of the various markings on NPs with a noun as head of the NP,
versus NP with only a personal pronoun as head of the NP. When studyinghiykwehyekweOBJ.NPhyeOBJ.NPhuok se

A non-topic marked hiy can never represent a pronoun without syntactic function.
3
See discussion below whether hiykwe can represent a non-syntactic topic-marked form of the pronoun.","[215, 216, 217, 218]"
"48b. Abstract and non-material nouns are nearly always
feminine
Non-material and abstract nouns like ok ‘talk’, aw ‘fight’, weyn
‘behaviour’, yayh ‘song’, mey ‘work’, oksa ‘sound’, hay ‘magic’,
nonkway ‘knowledge’ are all feminine. One exception observed is the
word prawk ‘smell, scent’ which is masculine. It is possible that smell is
considered material rather than non-material.
c. Objects regarded as two-dimensional are feminine
No object is of course truly two-dimensional, but thin objects like
leaves, tablets and coins are feminine. Insects, possibly on the basis that
they are regarded as two-dimensional, are also feminine nouns. The
contrast between two-dimensionality (feminine) and three-dimensionality
(masculine) is essential in gender determination. Two other features,
however, play a role in determining the gender of objects for which it is
hard to determine whether they should be classified as two-dimensional or
as three-dimensional. Objects with regular three-dimensional features tend
to be masculine, except if they have a very flat surface (see c1) or if the
roundness of the object (not in a 3- but only in a 2-dimensional way) is a
very salient feature (see c2).
c1. Objects with a flat surface which are not too voluminous
are feminine
An object that has a flat surface and not too voluminous is regarded as
feminine. In the Abau world view, all fish are regarded as having a flat
surface and are therefore feminine. The feature of a flat surface is also
dominant in nouns like howk ‘lake’ and iwa ‘swamp’, but not in yawp
‘river’. The latter is masculine, because here the feature of extendedness is
predominant. Body parts that have a flat surface and which are not too
voluminous are regarded feminine, e.g. iha ‘hand’, sune ‘foot’, nweyk
‘ear’. Most other body parts are considered three-dimensional and are
assigned masculine gender. This includes makwey ‘head’, kasaw ‘nose’,
nene ‘eye’, and uron ‘heart’.
c2. Objects which are round from a two-dimensional
perspective are feminine
When objects have two dimensional roundness as the predominant
feature, they are classed as feminine. The generic word for ‘snake’ sok is49masculine. Apparently, its extendedness is in focus. However, a particular
green garden snake wondeis is referenced with feminine pronominal
markers. This snake is often coiled up in the form of a circle and this
feature might be in focus here. Also included in this set of twodimensional roundness are the nouns hne ‘bird’s nest’ and kan ‘a vine
woven into a circle’. However, the loan word bal ‘ball’ is masculine,
because the roundness is here three-dimensional.
d. Objects regarded as three-dimensional are masculine
When the feature three-dimensionality is regarded as predominant the
noun is marked masculine. This depends on the perception of the speaker,
which may vary as is illustrated in examples (32) and (33). Truly threedimensional entities are certain fruits: su ‘coconut’ am ‘breadfruit’. As
long as the three-dimensional feature is predominant the entity can be
small, e.g. nene ‘eye’. This set also includes all liquids, e.g. hu ‘water’,
nioh ‘blood’, sueyr ‘rain’.
The distinction between two-dimensional or three-dimensional
depends on the perception of the speaker. The choice is sometimes
arbitrary, e.g. the word mein ‘stone’ occurs in a wide variety of forms and
sizes. When features like flatness and roundness are in focus the noun
mein is regarded as feminine. When, however, the features of threedimensionality or large size are in focus the noun mein is regarded as
masculine.
The word a ‘house’ is masculine, in spite of the fact that the object
has a number of flat surfaces. The predominant features which are in
focus are its large size and its three-dimensionality.
e. Animal categories are distinguished according to size
Larger animals tend to be masculine, smaller animals tend to be
feminine. Large animals, like mu ‘crocodile’, pareis ‘wallaby’, nwoh
‘dog’ are masculine. Animals that have as the salient feature
extendedness, like sok ‘snake’ , mnow ‘eel’ and kie ‘lizard’, are all
masculine.
Larger birds, like worim ‘flying fox’, wayp ‘eagle’, and mowr
‘hornbill’ are masculine, but a moderate-sized bird like sokua ‘cockatoo’
is regarded as feminine and so are all birds that are smaller than the
cockatoo.","[61, 62, 63]"

system. Bailey (1975: 9) posits two front vowels, one central vowel and
three back vowels. He concludes that the Abau phonemic system is
basically asymmetrical. However, research by Lock (2007) shows that
Abau has a very symmetric vowel and semi-vowel inventory. The
language also demonstrates symmetry in the way the five vowels and the
two semivowels occur together. The following contrastive features are
important for the way sequences are formed:
the feature [ +High] divides the seven vocoids in: /i/, /u/, /w/, /y/
versus the low vowels /e/, /a/, /o/
the contrast between [Front] and [Back] separates /i/, /e/, /y/ from /u/,
/o/, /w/ and leaves the central vowel /a/ in the middle, which is in
agreement with the fact /a/ has fewer restrictions on its
distribution than the non-central low vowels /e/ and /o/. The table
below shows on what basis various sequences are allowed or not
allowed.","[31, 32]"
"MAP 2: THE ABAU LANGUAGE AREA671.5 Language use and bilingualism
Three languages are used among the twenty five villages that make up
the Abau language group: Abau, Tok Pisin and in restricted context
English.
Abau is likely to be used in gatherings that deal with issues like
sorcery, disputes about land, women and property, marriage arrangements,
funeral rites, etc.
The further an Abau speaking village is removed from the Green
River Station, the higher the likelihood that discussions take place in Abau
rather than Tok Pisin. The Green River Station accommodates a large
number of non-local people who serve the large Green River areas as
administrators, police officers, teachers, medical and agricultural workers.
Many of them do not speak any of the local languages surrounding the
Green River Station Area.
Tok Pisin is likely to be used when a key person involved in a
discussion does not have a good control of the Abau language. The
number of the people in that category is still increasing through
intermarriage. When the topic of discussion relates to a notion that has
been introduced by outsiders (e.g. the clinic, school, church, planting of
rubber trees) it becomes more likely that the communication takes place in
Tok Pisin.
English is used nearly exclusively within the school system or with
visitors to the area who do not speak Tok Pisin. Even teachers will prefer
Tok Pisin over English when they are out of the school context.
Tok Pisin is widely used in all villages which are only one day travel
away from the Green River station and understood by children and adults
of all ages. It is less frequently used in villages which are further away
from Green River, but even there it is understood by all age groups. This
is remarkable given the fact that hardly anyone spoke or understood Tok
Pisin in the 1950s. Abau is still a vital language, but the number of young
people who feel more comfortable in Tok Pisin than in Abau is slowly
growing. These young people have often been away for long periods from
the language area because of High School or work. There is a strong
appreciation of their own language and culture, but on the other hand
there is no real shame involved in admitting to have poor mother tongue
language skills.","[19, 20, 21]"

‘As for this story, it is about snakes not having feet and

intended function
Attributive clauses that modify the head of the noun phrase for its
function or intended function are marked by ey ‘intention’. It is important
to note that this modal marker ey ‘INTN’ does not occur exclusively in
attributive clauses but also in main clauses as discussed in §5.3.2 and also
illustrated in (98).

‘Tomorrow night I intend to hunt with the dogs in the
swamp.’
The clause-final intention marker ey is also widely used to mark
embedded attributive clauses that modify the head of the NP it follows.
The embedded clause marked by ey ‘INTN’ is followed by a NP final
marker of the NP it modifies. The embedded clause functions as a modifier
for the NP it is positioned in.
In (99), the intentional marker ey indicates that the clause mu say
‘shoot crocodiles’, is an embedded attributive clause modifying the head
of the noun phrase yeik ‘arrows’. The attributive clause functions as part
of the NP and modifies the head of the NP for function or intended
function.","[241, 242]"
"7.3.3 Additional functions of negator korey

‘As for those children, they do not have any sicknesses and

Example (35) demonstrates the most frequent use of the negator lopa,
where it follows a nominal and indicates non-possession. It negates the NP
aiai-yok ‘seedlings’.
(35) Uwr aiai-yok
lopa lwak ankin, wueir liy

lopa lwak ankin
wueir liy
man food-shoot NEG be
if/when garden DYN
meio ley.
meio korey
work NEG
‘If a man does not have any seedlings, he cannot work a
garden.’
A NP marked by the negation marker lopa has the opposite meaning
of a NP marked with the comitative marker non. It is the contrast between
non-possession and possession. Compare (35) and (36).
(36) Uwr aiai-yok
non lwak ankin, wueir liy meio.
uwr aiai-yok
non lwak ankin
wueir liy meio
if/when garden DYN work
man food-shoot CMT be
‘If a man has seedlings, he can work a garden.’244The negation marker lopa normally marks only nominals indicating
non-possession. It also immediately follows the nominal. The negators
pey and pa (§7.3.1) are used to negate verbal clauses as is demonstrated in
(37).

huok hin

huok hin
lopa
pig
shoot NEG.PFTV
‘He went into the forest, but he did not shoot a pig.’
Although not very frequent, the negator lopa can follow a verb, as in
(38), and in doing so it nominalises the clause as an event that never took
place. The noun huok ‘pig’ and the verb hin ‘shoot’ form together the
nominal construction of ‘pig shooting’.

‘Keno was a young lad. He never had (the experience) of
shooting a pig.’
The negator lopa in (39) negates the nominalised construction kuey la
‘grub-eating’. By using the negator lopa ‘NEG.NOMS’, which is used for
nominal constructions, rather than the valid alternative of the verbal
negator pey ‘NEG. IPFTV’, the speaker emphasises the absolute nonoccurrence of the event over an extended period of time.

The imperfective negation marker pey is not used in a subordinate
clause, but the perfective negation marker pa and the nominalising
negator lopa are both used. The latter might be preferred when the
complete absence of the negated activity is the focus, but the semantic
difference between the use of pa or lopa in subordinate clauses is very
small. Both negators seem to be quite interchangeable within subordinate
clauses.
When a negation marker occurs in a subordinate clause, it needs to be
followed by the stative verb lwak ‘to be’ to form a grammatically correct
sentence.
In (40), the negator lopa occurs within a subordinate clause marked
by ankin ‘if’. The negator lopa is obligatorily followed by the stative verb
lwak.

tree 2/3PL-TOP food DYN bear NEG
‘If the sun never shines, the trees would not bear any fruit.’
The perfective negation marker pa can also be used within a
subordinate clause, as is demonstrated in (41). The stative verb lwak is
still obligatorily present. In (41), the verb hawr ‘wash’ is followed by the
perfective negation marker pa.
(41) Hromkwe

Example (42) demonstrates the same use of the negator lopa in
combination with the stative verb lwak in a subordinate clause.","[256, 257, 258, 259]"
