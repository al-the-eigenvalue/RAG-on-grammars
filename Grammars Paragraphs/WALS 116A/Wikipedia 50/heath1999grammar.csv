"It is possible to add the Emph particle yaa to such an answer, hence ay goo yaa
'Yes I will.'
The one case where such a truncated answer is not possible is a positive answer to
a perfective aspect question, since here the MAN slot is vacant, both positive polarity
and perfective aspect being unmarked. In this case, the only possibility is rjga! 'yes!'.
It follows that kalaa!, the corresponding 'no!' interjection, is not obligatory as an
answer to any yes-no question, and is not particularly common in this function.
However, kalaa! can also be used to contradict or challenge an assertion by an
interlocutor.
In (293a), note that Impf goo and its negation sii have their full forms, in contrast
to ο - go and si when followed by an overt VP. These same full forms are also used as
locational quasi-verbs meaning 'be (present)' and 'not be (present), be absent' (§7.1.2).",[192]
"176 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization
The morpheme rjga! can be used in isolation to mean 'yes!'. Note that rjga
elsewhere functions as the 3SgF pronoun, and as the SFoc (subject-focus) morpheme,
but the etymological connection of the 'yes!' interjection to these grammatical
morphemes is unclear. The form kalaa! means 'no!', again as an isolation form.
However, rjga! and kalaa! are not the preferred responses to polar questions.
Instead, wherever possible, the response to a yes-no question is a truncated echo clause
consisting of a pronominal subject and a nonzero MAN morpheme, the remainder of
the clause being omitted. (293a) shows positive and negative responses to a question
in imperfective aspect, while (293b) shows a negative reply to a question in the

"In (288b), the war ra 'in you(Pl)' is a delayed partitive for the fronted 'who?'.
The identificational quasi-verb nono (§7.1.1), as in nono 'it is (a) Y,' does not
permit its sole overt NP to be focalized. We therefore cannot tell on this basis whether
the ""Y"" NP is a syntactic subject (requiring SFoc rjga} or a nonsubject (requiring Foe
nä). It is also not possible to focalize out of the main clause in an impersonal bara
construction, of the form bara plus embedded clause (§7.1.3). This is an obvious
consequence of the lack of any NP in the main (as opposed to embedded) clause.
On the other hand, focalization is possible with the locational quasi-verbs,
positive goo and negative sii (§7.1.2), and with the identificational copula verb ci
(§7.1.1). See the interrogative examples (295a) and (296b-c) in §8.2.2, below.
However, in the case of ci, an emphatic and apparently focalized subject NP may
dispense with SFoc rjga, as seen by the absence of this morpheme in (289).

8.2.1 Polar (yes-no) questions and answers
KCh has no reliable polar interrogative morpheme. The usual simple polar question
has the form of an assertion, usually with rising terminal intonation (290a). Some
younger speakers use clause-initial eska (Fr est-ce que ...?), which is widespread in8.2 Questions and answers175Malian languages. A morpheme kona (variants koni, kooni) is attested as an apparent
clause-initial polar interrogative marker (290b), but it is very rare in my data and is
probably a dialectal borrowing from Fulfulde.

The tag question is n bey ?, literally 'did you(Sg) know?' can be used regardless
of the form of the preceding assertion. It does not seem to be very common, at least in
Timbuktu. The yes-no interrogative wala can be used after (as well as at the beginning186 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization

desperately needed.","[201, 202]"

ci Υ nono, which functions as the usual negative counterpart of Υ nono, with the
emphasis on identification rather than description. Although the relevant part of (231)

"The combination rjga plus Impf ο is transcribed gga^ ο but pronounced [rjgo:]. It is
homophonous with rjgu^ o, consisting of Logo/3ReflSg pronoun plus Impf.
SFoc gga always appears in the seam between an overt subject NP (which may be
a pronoun) and an immediately following overt core sentence. This is the same pattern

"8.1 Focus constructions
Many sentences have no special focus marking. There are, however, productive devices
for marking a particular non-verb constituent (pronoun, full NP, PP, lexical adverbial)
as grammatical ""focus."" The semantic-pragmatic point of marking a focus is to
highlight it as a choice made among two or more logically possible options. The
focused constituent therefore bears the most contestable, unexpected, or novel
information. WH-questions, and answers to them, are the prototypical examples.
Syntactically, the focused constituent is fronted to the left of the obligatory core
of the sentence (subject NP, MAN morphemes, verb). In most cases a focus
morpheme [SFoc or Foe] is inserted between the focused constituent and the core of
the sentence. Nonsubject and subject focus constructions must be distinguished.",[182]
"8.2.5 Questions embedded under matrix verbs ('know', 'ask', etc.)
Interrogatives are often embedded under verbs of uncertainty. 'Wonder, be curious',
'find out', and 'inquire' are the most obvious, but 'know' and 'see* may also take
interrogative complements (Ί don't know who hit me,' Ί want to see whether he
comes').
Embedded polar (yes-no) questions can be glossed with 'whether'. The
construction is basically a disjunction (Ί don't know whether he hit me' can be
expanded as Ί don't know whether he hit me, or he didn't me'). In KCh, wala is used
before each such embedded clause, in both monoclausal and biclausal cases. For
examples and discussion see §9.5.4.
We now consider what happens to the WH-interrogative forms (§8.2.2). The
general principle is that the WH-interrogative stem or phrase is replaced by a noninterrogative generic NP (normally indefinite in form) which functions as direct object
or other complement of the higher verb. The remainder of the WH-interrogative clause1848 Discourse-functional constructions and relativizationsurfaces in the form of a relative clause with the generic NP as head. For example,
embedded 'who?' and 'what?' are replaced by '(a) person who ...' and '(a) thing which
...', asin(311).

omitted, as in (312).

On the other hand, if na were a complementizer bracketed with the core clause
following the focalized constituent, we might expect na to be repeated in a second core
clause attached to the same fronted focus. However, this putative construction, of the
type #[Millet pudding [na we bought] (and) [na we ate]], did not occur in texts and was
rejected by informants. Instead, we get a single na directly following the focused
constituent, before the two parallel core clauses, as in (274). This casts doubt on the
complementizer analysis of na.

In the case of simple polar questions, there is a logical choice between a proposed
assertion and its negation. 'Did the blacksmith go to the market?' asks the addressee to
choose between 'The blacksmith went to the market' and ""The blacksmith did not go

""the blacksmith went to the market"" true, or is ""the blacksmith did not go to the

"The question arises whether to take marje ~ merje as basically an adjective or a
noun. If we take it as a lexical adjective, the modifying use (300b) is unproblematic.
The use as NP head (300a,d-e) would then be interpreted as involving a zero Absol
prefix (§4.4.3, §4.5.1), which is slightly awkward but not outlandish. If we take it as
a noun, the head-noun use is straightforward, but the apparently modifying use would
have to be reinterpreted as involving a loose compound NP marje in which the NP
has partitive function ('how much of NP?').
With equational ci 'be', merje takes postverbal position, as in the question in
(301a), or it may be fronted in the usual focalization construction, as in (301b).
(301)a.",[195]
"5.8 Markers of discourse status
5.8.1 Focus (Foe na and SFoc rjga)
Focalized constituents (as we use the term here) are always fronted to a position
preceding the remainder of the clause. This is most obvious with constituents that are
otherwise postverbal, such as direct objects and adpositional complements. Since
subjects are clause-initial anyway, their focalization does not produce an obvious
""fronting,"" but one can argue nonetheless that fronting occurs here too.
The usual markers of focalization are Subject Focus (SFoc) qga, inserted
obligatorily between a focalized subject and the following material (MAN morphemes,
then VP), and non-subject Focus (Foe) na, which can be omitted under some
conditions but is usually present after an NP (or adverbial) fronted from post-verbal
position. Simple examples are in (129).

'What [focus] are you looking for?' (nonsubject focus)For fuller discussion of the syntax, see §8.1.1-2. Historically, na reflects a weak

demonstrative.) SFoc rjga is intriguingly homophonous to 3SgF pronoun rjga (§8.4.2).
There is considerable variation in the form of SFoc morphemes throughout the KChDjCh-KS zone, permitting speakers of each dialect to make different morphemic
associations (with attendant ""deep"" syntactic analysis) for the SFoc marker.
It is doubtful that either na or rjga forms a surface constituent, strictly speaking,
with the preceding focalized constituent. If it did, one would expect that the particle
would occur as part of truncated WH questions ('who?') and as part of truncated replies
to WH questions (Q: 'What did you find?'; A: ""The dog'). However, na and rjga are
never used in this way; the truncated interrogative or reply consists simply of the
focalized interrogative pronoun or NP. The truncated form of (129b) is maa 'what?',
not #maa na, and that of (129a) is ay T, not #ay rjga.
NPs (and PPs) are not the only constituents that can be, in principle, focalized.
VPs can be focal (Q: 'What did you do?'; Α: Ί cried'), as can truth values ('Yes I did
see him'). However, in KCh there is no overt grammatical marking of verb, VP, or
truth-value focus. In practice, ""focus"" applies to NPs, PPs, and adverbials like 'here'
and 'today' which can be analysed as reduced or defective NPs.","[116, 117]"

verb, the direct object being expressed as the noun addelill di 'the reason' with an
attached Rel clause (Ί asked [to him] the reason for which ...').
The compound interrogatives (§8.2.3) are generally quite easy to embed, since
most of them already consist of a generic noun plus foo 'which?'. The corresponding
embedded questions omit the foo and show up as heads of relatives. For mise foo (and
variants) 'how?' and taka foo 'how?', both literally 'way (=manner) which?', we get

The basic 'whatchamacallit?' expressions are hajje (variant haya-jje) and haywana.

variant hay plus compound final -ije 'child' in diminutive sense (for the phonology
see §3.8.3). The second form may be a variant of hay wane with Poss wane.
These forms are used as indefinites ('something or other, gizmo, thingamajig') or

expressions that have been temporarily forgotten (316).

In conditional constructions, the antecedent ('if...') sometimes contains more than one

modifiers within larger NPs, optionally remain in place (in situ) in the core sentence.
This is probably because the larger NP would have to be fronted as a whole, and
""heavy"" NPs are less easy to front than are simple interrogatives like 'who?'.
Examples of m situ interrogative foo and merje are in (310).","[198, 199]"
"Here war^ nda cere (plus Emph daa) is a fronted focalized NP in subject

makes no sense since war '2 is plural and already denotes the full set of able-bodied
men in question, which is expressed as an afterthought by war baalici di yo 'you
adult men'. So there is no alternative to taking nda cere as a quantifying expression,
not unlike kul 'all' but emphasizing joint (cooperative) action rather than simple
universality. Incidentally, the predicate guna cere 'see each other' (by extension

"8.4.3 Use of weak Topic marker ta
The morpheme ta is quite common and versatile, so much so that it is difficult to
gloss. We will label it ""Top,"" but will often refer to it as a ""weak"" topic marker to
contrast it with Top bine and 3SgF rjga (see the preceding two sections).
This fa, which follows the topical constituent in question, is to be distinguished
from two other common ta morphemes. One is a variant, used after kaa 'come', of
Infinitival] ka, hence kaa ta VP (§9.G.7). The other is a Future morpheme used only
after Impf o - go (§7.2.5). Any fa in the texts which does not follow kaa 'come' or
Impf o - go can be safely identified as the Top morpheme
Weak Top fa is common with preposed topical NPs, as in (372). In this case, if
the referent in question recurs (in any syntactic function) in the following core
sentence, we get a resumptive pronoun. If the preposed constituent is a spatiotemporal
adverbial there is no resumptive element. The structures are the same as the preposed
topics, with or without bine, described in §8.4.1.

We next consider marje ~ merje. This form can be used syntactically as a fullfledged NP (300a,d-e), or it may quantify over an indefinite noun (300b) with no
change in form. When denoting the price of a commodity ('for ten riyals'), there is
generally no 'for' postposition although the constituent with marje ~ merje functions8.2 Questions and answers179as a kind of adverbial phrase (300c). In this unit-price context, a distributive
reduplication is also possible (§5.4.4).","[194, 195]"
"In (272a), the NP positions clearly coindexed with the focused constituent are in
the second and third clauses of a three-clause sequence ('we bend over, we look at
themx, we touch them x ') which functions en bloc as a conditional antecedent bound by
nda 'if. Note gi 'them' twice as a resumptive pronoun coindexed with the focused
constituent 'bits'. There is no clearly coindexed trace in the main clause ('we find that
small chunks are in it'), although one might argue adventurously that 'bits' occurs8.1 Focus constructions169logically in this clause in some way (On the basis of ...'). In (272b), the resumptive
pronoun 'it' is the subject of a 'that' clause subordinated to the verb 'notice'.
There remains the question whether Foe morpheme na forms a constituent with
the preceding fronted constituent, serves as a complementizer introducing the
following core sentence, or has an independent syntactic status. In other words, is
English Beans I like or clefted It's beans that I like (with complementizer that) the
better syntactic parallel to the KCh na construction? I find it difficult to make this
decision on empirical rather than theory-internal grounds.
In the focus construction, the fronted constituent and the core sentence are, in
general, tightly knit prosodically. There are occasional textual examples where one
detects a brief pause after na, but hesitations can also occur after that in English clefts
due to processing considerations, cf. the free translation of (272b). Examples like
(271) could be taken as evidence that na is bracketed with the preceding focalized
constituent, but only if we consider the material intervening between na and the tracecontaining clause as being completely outside the focalization construction. However,
it is preferable to bracket the type in (271) as 'NPX na [[we come] and [we share /, ]],'
with the 'come' and 'share' clauses fused together (cf. §9.5.2), in which case we have
no new information about how to bracket the na.
If na formed a constituent with the focalized constituent, it would be reasonable to
expect the two to occur together in truncated replies to WH questions. But na cannot
surface after a bare focalized constituent. This is shown by the exchange in (273).","[184, 185]"
"Literally, this is '... for which reason [I greeted himx hex did not reply],' both
verbs in the embedded question being imperfective. Clearly the WH interrogative has
been extracted from 'he did not reply,' while greeted him/ functions as background.
The verb jo w can be used as a simple transitive 'take', or a serial verb meaning
'do energetically'; see (594) in §9.7.5. It is rarely attested with a following

"10.1.2 Logophorics and deictic shifts in reported speech
We begin by noting that KCh has no analogue to the tense shifts that typically occur
in reported (past) speech in languages like English, where Ί want a mango' is reported
as 'she said she wanted a mango.' The basic KCh VP categories are imperfective and
(unmarked) perfective aspect, which require no adjustment due to the temporal
displacement of reporting past speech. Schematically, Ί Impf want [mango one]'
becomes [3Sg say, LogoSg Impf want [mango one]].
The most systematic indexical shift in reported speech is the replacement of
original first person pronouns by a type of pronoun known as ""logophoric,"" which is
used only for this purpose. In KCh, logophoric pronouns are identical in form to third
person reflexive (""3Refl"") pronouns. The basic Logo/3ReflSg pronoun is ijgu, with
plural counterpart ggu-yo or ggi-yo, the latter variant homophonous to the plural of
3SgF pronoun rjga (§5.8.2, §8.4.2). For analysis of the forms, with further variants,
see §3.8.8.
Logo/3ReflSg ijgu ~ ηυ is easy to distinguish from 3SgF rjga in most
environments. However, both combine with a following Impf o to give phonetic
[qgo:]. Our transcriptional system uses underlying representations plus a ligature to
indicate that contraction (§3.7.1) has occurred, hence we write qgu^ ο or qga^ ο
depending on which pronoun is involved. Readers working through published texts
presented with this ligature format should appreciate that each such transcription
represents an interpretation of the text fragment in question. On occasion a serious
analyst of KCh texts may disagree with the transcriber's interpretation, or conclude
that alternative readings are possible.
In interlinear glosses, I not only distinguish between ""3F* and ""Logo/3Refl""
forms, I also try to specify logophoric and reflexive functions of the latter. This
functional distinction is often straightforward, but in quite a few textual instances the
pronoun in question has both functions. For example, in 'shex said [she, would prepare
herselfj,' 'herself,' is both 3Refl (within its clause) and Logo (coindexed with the
quoted speaker). In ambiguous or doubly-marked cases we will use the noncommittal
""Logo/3Refl"" label in interlinears. It is also possible to have doubly logophoric
pronouns, as in 'she, said [shex would tell him [to hit her,]],' where the final pronoun32410 Anaphora, logophorics, and reported speechhas the same referent as antecedent at two higher levels, but we do not distinguish
double from single logophoricity in interlinears.
Examples of (nonreflexive) logophoric pronouns are in (619).

""They (=masons)x will consider you now that (=as though) you arc

The logophoric pronoun is used in any syntactic position whatever (e.g.
possessor, object of PP, subject of embedded relative). See the following section for
more on the syntax. Note also that a single quotative clause with har 'say' (or kaabu
'consider, reckon') can bind any number of logophoric pronouns. In fact, a single
chunk of reported speech may be a long second-hand story, in which case logophoric
pronouns can (in theory) be used throughout the narrative.
Logophoric pronouns are not used when the quoted speaker also happens to be the
current speaker or hearer. Instead, first or second person pronouns are used in the
quoted segment. With first person plural or singular speaker, we get examples like
(620a-b). There is no alternative construction.","[339, 340]"
"10.3 Generic and indefinite reference
10.3.1 boro 'person* and 2Sg pronouns
The primary term used to introduce an indefinite or generic human discourse referent
('someone, anyone') is the bare indefinite noun boro '(a) person*. The initial
introduction of such a discourse referent may be in any syntactic position. Among the
common sites for an initial introduction are conditional antecedents ('if someone
comes, ..."" or 'if you see someone, ...'), and the head of a relative clause ('someone
who ...'). The latter is expressed as bor kaa ... (§3.8.7).
Subsequent mentions of the indefinite referent often take the form of 2Sg
pronouns. Generic you is familiar enough from English; what is distinct about KCh is
that the introduction is often in the form boro 'a person', with 2Sg then used as a kind
of anaphoric pronoun—whether in the same clause or in an embedded or following
clause. Some examples combining boro and 2Sg pronoun in generic function are in346 10 Anaphora, logophorics, and reported speech
(668); the ""free"" translations retain the original pronominal categories, so the English
is awkward.

ws_*JThis pattern is very common and may be considered the normal treatment of
generic referents in simple passages. However, it is also possible for boro in generic
function to be repeated in subsequent mentions as boro or as a 3Sg pronoun. This
pattern can be applied when for some reason it is inappropriate to offer the addressee an
opportunity to symbolically enter the role of the generic personnage in question, or
(more cogently) in passages where the 2Sg category has been pre-empted by a distinct
discourse referent, denoting either the addressee as such or a second generic discourse
referent.
This is the case in the examples in (669). In (669a), 2Sg is initially used to
denote the addressee in a (meta-)pragmatic comment, after which 2Sg is used
generically. When a second generic discourse referent is introduced as boro 'someone'
in 'you call for someone,' it must remain distinct from 2Sg and so is mentioned in
3Sg form (a) in the following subjunctive clause. In (669b), two distinct generic
discourse referents (subscripted indices ""p"" and ""t"" in the free translation) are introduced
as boro. The first is then repeated in 2Sg form, which forces the second to adopt 3Sg
agreement (a in a na dam).

"2. l Brief outline of typical sentence and NP structures13Occasionally a NP with topic marking is treated as part of the sentence proper,
namely as its subject NP. In this case, the MAN morphemes and the VP immediately
follow the topic-marked subject NP.
While topic-marked NPs are generally sentence-external, focalized NPs are clearly
part of sentential syntax even though the focused NP (or PP) is always fronted
(=extracted). (We use ""preposed"" or in connection with sentence-external elements such
as most topic-marked NPs, ""fronted"" or ""extracted"" for sentence-internal movement
associated with focalization, WH-interrogatives, and perhaps relativization). In KCh,
unlike KS, extraction normally leaves behind a phonologically zero trace (rather than a
resumptive pronoun).
The focalization system sharply distinguishes subject focus from other focus
structures. If the grammatical subject is the focus, the morpheme rjga occurs between
subject NP and the remainder of the sentence (16).

3SgO
Ί [focus] saw him (her).' (= 'It was I [no-one else] who saw ...')Without the SFoc morpheme, there would be no way to tell that the subject has
been focalized, since subjects precede MAN morphemes and VPs. SFoc ijga is
phonologically identical with a ""Full"" (nonclitic) 3Sg pronoun which we label
""3SgF."" This raises the possibility of construing SFoc .rjga as a kind of subject
resumptive pronoun: the subject NP, here ay (ISg), is shifted to the left, out of the
subject position into a special focus slot, whereby a type of 3Sg subject pronoun
appears in the true subject position. However, this analysis is only one of the
possibilities to be explored later, and it is problematic for the upriver dialects.
For non-subject focus, the normal KCh construction is to front (extract) the
focused constituent, adding Focus morpheme na before the subject NP. This pattern is
especially common in WH questions and responses to such questions (17).

"Note that some of the combinations in question involve a second verb of motion
in the infinitival VP. Such combinations are likely to be semi-frozen and idiomatic,
and might be described as compounds, jur 'run', for example, seems to occur as serial
verb chiefly in JUT ka kaa 'come running' and jur ka koy 'go running'.
Another set of verbs that are commonly combined with a following infinitival VP
are verbs denoting actions that take place at particular times of day: biyaa 'VP in early
morning', hanna 'VP all night, VP at night, stay up at night VP-ing', and hoy 'VP
in the middle of the day'. An example of this construction is (602), and variations

"10.4 Sloppy (partial) coreferentiality
""Sloppy"" coreferentiality or coindexation is present when two NPs denote,
respectively, a set and one of this set's proper subsets. Thus 'we' and T are in a
sloppy relationship, since the denotation of the former strictly contains that of the
latter (the denotion of T is a strict subset of the denotation of 'we'). The combination
of such sloppily coreferential NPs poses problems, since some grammatical
mechanisms are based on the coreferential-noncoreferential distinction. This applies to
reflexive constructions (antecedent is usually the clause-mate subject NP), logophoric
pronouns (antecedent is the quoted speaker), and relative clauses (antecedent is the head
NP).
In the following sections, a subscripted index ""xy"" indicates that the denotation in
question strictly contains that represented by ""x"" or ""y,"" as in 'wexy' vis-a-vis Ίχ'.
In theory, we should also consider cases involving the complex intersection of
two overlapping sets, e.g., 'theyxy' and 'theyyz', where only ""y"" is shared.",[366]
"406 Appendix 2
8.2.2 WH-questions
The simple WH-interrogatives are: mey 'who?', maa 'what?', me ~ men or mee-here
'where?', merje-marje 'how many?"" or 'how much?', foo 'which?' (Absolute i-fod),
and mote 'how?'. Sentence examples are in §8.1.1-2 (fronted) and §8.2.4 (in situ).
Plural mey yoo 'who?' is attested, though the unmarked singular is usual. PI
maa yoo 'what?' seems to be rare (compare maa yoo 'names').
8.2.3 Composite WH-interrogatives ('how?', 'why?', 'when?')
Composite terms for 'how?' are misa foo, saa foo, or taka foo, all containing foo
'which?'. The original nouns involved are mise - misa and taka, both meaning
essentially 'manner', saa foo is probably a transformation of *(mi)se foo, perhaps
contaminated with an earlier *saa foo 'what time?'.
'Why?' is maa see, literally 'to (for) what?'. Clause-initially, the phrase can also
mean 'because' (§9.5.7). 'When?' is alwakati foo, literally 'which time?'.
8.2.4 In situ (non-fronted) WH-interrogatives
WH-interrogatives are semantically focal. They may be fronted (several examples in
§8.1.1-2). However, a characteristic of basilectal DjCh is that focal and relativized
constituents remain in situ (in place), as in the WH-interrogative cases in (760). Emph
yaa can be added to an unfronted (as well as fronted) focal constituent (760a,c).","[421, 422]"
"7.2.2 Perfective and imperfective
The basic Impf morpheme is ο ~ go. By far the predominant form in Timbuktu is o.
The Impf morpheme follows the subject and is followed by the verb; the only
morpheme which may intervene between Impf and the verb is Future ta (§7.2.5).
Since all pronouns, NP-final grammatical morphemes (e.g. Def di or PI yo), and SFoc
gga end in a vowel, as do many noun stems, o usually undergoes VV-Contraction. In
the case of pronouns, some of the contractions are irregular, see (35) in (§3.7.1).
The combination of Impf plus Neg is expressed by the portmanteau morpheme si,
glossed ImpfNeg (§7.2.1). The imperfective-perfective opposition is neutralized in the
subjunctive mood (§7.2.4), and with identificational quasi-verb nono (§7.1.1). It is
only unreliably expressed with equational ci 'be' (§7.1.1).
There are two situations where ο - go is replaced by goo, and ImpfNeg si by sii.
The first situation is in truncated replies to yes-no questions (§8.2.1). The second
situation, in our preferred analysis, is locational predications of the type 'be (in a
place)', where we get apparent quasi-verbs goo and sii (§7.1.2).
There is no true tense marking in KCh. However, the basic aspect categories,
perfective (unmarked) and imperfective (o - go), have temporal as well as aspectual
implications. We first consider ordinary sentences (without complementizers or special
serial verbs), then discuss aspectual usage in specialized syntactic constructions. We
focus first on action and process verbs, returning below to verbs of adjectival quality,
which have special features.
In both hypothetical and counterfactual conditionals, the antecedent ('if ...') clause
is most often perfective, though it may be imperfective under limited conditions. The
consequent clause is always imperfective. Since the antecedent may contain more than
one clause, the perfective-to-imperfective transition is often a crucial clue in
identifying the break between antecedent and consequent (§9.5.1).
In ordinary past-tense narratives, perfective and imperfective may alternate in the
fashion familiar from many languages. Perfective is associated with abrupt or
otherwise bounded events of the sort that are usually foregrounded in narrative.
Imperfective applies prototypically to prolonged, incomplete or otherwise unbounded
situations or processes of the sort commonly used in narrative as backgrounds, their
temporal intervals encompassing those of superimposed foregrounded events. Consider
(252).",[172]
"The regular output of (65 la) has a 3Refl possessor for 'dog', on clause-internal
grounds (coindexation with the subject of 'eat'). The question then is whether the
possessor of 'dog' is also expressed as 3Refl in (65 Ib) on the grounds of coindexation
with the more distant matrix subject. If so, (65 la) and (65 Ib) will be indistinguishable
on the surface.
It appears that long-distance reflexive binding usually does not occur in (65 Ib),
so the two constructions generally remain distinct. An example of (65 Ib) is (652).

"Consider first that portion of Ql which is external to Q2. In this zone, any

since each is coindexed with a quoted speaker, albeit at different levels. To the listener,
the surface structure corresponding to Q2 in (625) is ambiguous, since each LogoSg
pronoun in Q2 could correspond to either X or Y.
Because Logo is an obligatory category when its conditions are met, the use of
ordinary 3Sg or 3P1 pronouns within a quotation specifically indicates that the referent
in question is distinct from that of the attributed speaker. Consider (626), a
modification of (625) with a 3Sg pronoun in the embedded quotation.

"3.10.6 Loss of final short vowel
Stem-final high vowels {i u} have been dropped without trace in many *CVVCV
stems. This process has occurred in Timbuktu KCh and in DjCh, but not in the
upriver KCh towns such as Niafunko, and it is an interesting piece of evidence for
direct relations between Timbuktu and Djenne"". For the vowel to be dropped, it is
necessary that the resulting C,VVC2 shape be pronounceable, which effectively limits
the process to stems with a sonorant C2 and excludes stems where the long VV is high
{// uu}. Examples of vowel dropping are beer 'be big', moor 'be distant', yoon 'rub
in, anoint', doon 'millet cream', and taam 'pair of shoes'. Compare KS beer;, mooru,
yoonu, doonu, and taami. The process does not apply when the consonant in question
is an obstruent, so the bisyllabic form is always preserved in cases like yoobu 'market'
andjeesi 'tilt'. I know of no case where the final vowel has been dropped in a stem
with long high vowel, so stems like tuuru 'reply' and jiiri 'year* remain bisyllabic.
(For further evidence regarding the historical role of long high vowels, see the
following section).
There are some stems that satisfy the conditions for the process which for some
reason also preserve the bisyllabic shape, e.g., jaari 'day', maani '(animal) fat'.
The examples known to me which undergo this *CVVCV —> C,VVC2 reduction
have a C2 from the set {r n m}. It is difficult to say whether the absence of 7 and the
semivowels { w y] from the inventory is accidental. Among the stems which do not
reduce are laali 'be cursed (unfortunate)' and haawi 'be ashamed; shame'. Since certain
stems even with C2 {r n m} do not reduce for reasons which are not entirely clear
(/aari and maa/ii were just mentioned), I cannot determine whether examples like laali
and haawi are similar isolated exceptions, or whether their C2 is incompatible with the523 Phonologyreduction. It may be relevant that haawi, though now functioning as verb or noun, is
likely to represent an original nominalization *haaw-i.
Comparisons like KCh JUT with KS zuru 'run', and KCh wir with KS wiri 'seek',
indicate that either KCh has dropped an original final vowel or that KS has added an
echo vowel. The cases in question are of the shape Cir(i) or Cur(u) with tap r and
short high vowel(s). Since KS also has some inherited verbs of the shape Cur without
echo vowel (KCh = KS dur 'pound grain'), it is possible that KCh was the innovator
and that the reconstructions are *zuru, * wiri, and *dur as in KS.","[67, 68]"
"3.10.5 Palatalization of velars
Many stems now have c which reflects older *k, or j reflecting older *g. The velar
underwent palatalization (and affrication) before a front vowel */ or *e by a process
which still has some synchronic validity (§3.6.4), but in the stems in question the
lexical representation now has the palatoalveolar affricate rather than the original velar
stop.
Examples are taaSi 'four' <*taaki, dide (alongside dike) for 'basket', jiji 'go up'
<*zigi (via *jigi), and kanje 'knee'. The original velars are preserved in each case in
one or more other Malian Songhay languages, and sometimes in upriver dialects or in
DjCh. Palatalization has also been spreading in KS, where reanalyses of lexical
representations are ongoing. This is therefore an interesting areal development cutting
across the basic language divisions, linking KS especially with the adjoining
Timbuktu variety of KCh.",[67]

Loc]goo is clearly related to Impf (positive) ο ~ go (<*go), as is sii to ImpfNeg si. In
sentences with ordinary verbs, ο and si are members of the set of MAN (mood-aspectnegation) morphemes that intervene between subject NP and verb (§7.2.1). That the
connection between {goo sii} and the cognate imperfect!ve morphemes ο ~ go and si is
synchronically real is shown by the fact that the imperfective morphemes are
pronounced goo and sii in the one situation where they are clause-final; namely, in
truncated replies to yes-no questions and similar echoes (§8.2.1). Moreover, locational
{goo sii} cannot be preceded by MAN morphemes (#o goo, #ma goo, etc.).
If we were to assume that the ""verb"" position is obligatorily filled in any
predicate, the preferred analysis of (234a-b) would be to take {goo sii} as verbs, albeit
a special type of verbs which do not allow MAN morphemes. Alternatively, since
these quasi-verbs are apparently morphemically identical to the cognate preverbal
MAN morphemes, one could argue that {goo sii} in (234a-b) are simply stressed
allomorphs of Impf (positive) ο ~ go and ImpfNeg si, used when the following verb
position is vacant (a possibility limited to locationals). The two analyses lead to the
alternative parsings in (235a-b) for sentence (234a).

neeI favor (236b) over (236a). However, we might also consider additional variations
on the general approach (235b), represented here as (235c-d). In (235c), goo is a MAN
morpheme as in (235b), but the verb position is filled by a ""light"" (i.e. low-content)
verb BE that happens to be phonologically null. In (235d) we have started out with the7.1 Types of predicates149same structure, but the MAN morpheme goo has then been fused or adjoined to BE,
perhaps leaving a (coindexed) trace tx behind.
In (235c-d), we might equate the BE verb specifically with bara 'be, exist'
(following section). In any event, forms with overt bara are closely related
syntactically to the goo and sii sentences we have been discussing. There are three
syntactic contexts where goo and sii are syntactically impossible, and where
constructions involving bara are used instead. First, goo and sii cannot be used in
subjunctives, where they are replaced by, respectively, the positive and negative
subjunctive of bara. The subjunctive equivalent of (234a) is therefore / ma bara nee
'that they be here.' Second, goo and sii cannot be used in imperatives, so we again
make use of the subjunctive of bara to fill the void; see (266) in §7.3. Third, goo is
not allowed in infinitival VPs, again requiring the use of bara, as in ... ka bara nee
'... to be here.' We can therefore get a very close approximation to the surface facts by
arguing that there is an underlying existential-locative BE verb which is realized as
zero following imperfective morphemes, and as bara elsewhere. In order to actually
formalize this analysis, we would have to distinguish this BE, realized as (0 ~ bara,},
from bara2 in the sense 'exist', since bara2 can occur after Impf as well as other MAN
morphemes (following section). In any event, existential-locative BE is clearly distinct
from equational or identificational quasi-verbs (oi 'be', ποπό 'it is') described above.
Although goo and sii in (234a-b) are basically locational rather than pure
existentials, in some textual occurrences the following LP seems to be nearly pro
forma, and the clause comes close to a pure existential predication with little emphasis
on location. The favorite ""bleached"" locationals used for this purpose are doodi ~ dooti
'there* and third person pronominal Locative PPs such as a ra 'in it, therein'. Both
occur in (236), which describes how one detects limestone deposits in the bush; the
key phrases are bolded in the free translation as well as in the interlinears.

Introduction1.1 Generalities about Songhay
Songhay is often described loosely as a ""language,"" but in fact it is a large complex of
varieties, some of which are quite clearly distinct languages. Languages of the
Songhay family are linguistically dominant in northeastern Mali along the Niger
River, and others of the family occupy much of the Republic of Niger (""Kaado"" and
""Zarma""). Additional varieties are spoken in Bonin, and perhaps still residually in the
Dori area of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta). Some ""nomadic"" or ""northern""
Songhay languages, not yet well studied, are spoken by small beduin groups in far
northern Niger, with one offshoot each extending into Mali ('Tadaksahak"" near
Menaka) and in southwestern Algeria (""Korandje"" in the Tabelbala oasis). The major
work on the internal genetic classification of Songhay varieties is that of Nicola'i
(1981), who puts considerable emphasis on sound changes and phonological typology.
My work on Songhay has focused to date on the four main varieties spoken in
Mali. The following sets of designations are partially interchangeable. One set
consists of transcriptions of the native terms; the second is simply the name (in
English or French) of the respective major town; the third is the cardinal-direction
system developed by Nicola'i.

eastern Songhay (S. oriental)
central Songhay (S. central)For Gao, koroboro senn-i co-occurs with other variants such as koyra senn-i and
koyra senn-e.
The nouns ciini and senn-i ~ senn-i (with variant senn-e ~ senn-e) are noncognate,
though both mean 'speech, speaking, language', cf. verbs cii (<*ciin) and selaq seien. In the cases of Djenne and Hombori, both of which are (in effect) Songhay
enclaves rather than parts of extended Songhay-speaking regions, the first term of the
compound is simply the name of the town. Timbuktu and Gao, on the other hand, are
merely the largest cities in extended Songhay-speaking regions, and the terms for these
varieties are more general: koyra-ciini 'town language' and koroboro-senn-i
(contraction of koyra-boro senn-i 'town-person language') distinguish the sedentary
Songhays from the nomadic Arabs and Tuaregs. The Songhay are also sometimes
called 'river people' (Timbuktu isa-boro), but no related expression for their language
is in common use.
For the native sense of sonoy, see beginning of §1.2.
We will use the informal transcription ""Koyra Chiini"" to denote the unbroken
koyra ciini complex of dialects in the region along and near the Niger River beginning21 Introductionwith Timbuktu. This includes the towns of Dire"", Tonka, Goundam, and Niafunke
going upriver (west) from Timbuktu. There is a thinly populated northern extension in
Araouane, on the caravan route from Timbuktu to Taoudenni. There is a relatively
sharp linguistic break between Koyra Chiini and Koroboro Senni (the ""Gao"" variety)
just east of Timbuktu. Koroboro Senni is the traditional language even of Gourma
Rharous and Bamba, the first important towns on the Niger River going east from
Timbuktu.
Most of my Koyra Chiini data are from Timbuktu itself. I have a corpus of some
six hours of transcribed recordings, mostly dyadic (interviews, conversations, or
narratives with an interactive listener). I have supplemented this data base with elicited
material obtained chiefly in the final field sessions (1996-97).
I also have some transcribed recordings from Niafunke"" and Goundam, which can
serve as representatives of the larger complex of ""upriver"" dialects (""upriver"" from the
perspective of Timbuktu). I also spent about a week in this area in 1996 to clear up
some problems in the analysis of these tapes and to do some follow-up elicitation and
ethnobiological vocabulary elicitation and specimen collection. A summary of
observable differences between the upriver dialects and the Timbuktu dialect is given in
the short Appendix 1. In the much larger Appendix 2, I describe the distinctive and
geographically separated variety of Djenno, which I refer to as ""Djenne Chiini"" (for
jenne ciini, literally ""Djenn6 language""). Abbreviations for the Malian Songhay
languages and varieties used in this grammar are KCh (Koyra Chiini, the present
object of study), DjCh (Djenne Chiini), KS (Koroboro Senni of Gao, etc.), and HS
(Humburi Senni of Hombori). Names of other Songhay languages are not abbreviated.
The wider genetic affiliation of Songhay is controversial. It is one of the few
African languages for which Joseph Greenberg (1966) did not make a confident
assignment to a large genetic stock, though he suggested Nilo-Saharan as a possible
connection. Nicolai (1984, 1990) has suggested a possible Creole origin in which
Tamashek (Tuareg) played a major lexifying role, but this has not won wide
acceptance. It might be advisable to defer reconsideration of the wider affiliation of the
Songhay complex until we have better descriptions of the several varieties within the
complex and can thus do serious reconstruction of Proto-Songhay.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"

The sequence 'either ... , or ...' can also be expressed asymmetrically, with
another particle maa (<Ar. 'immaa 'either ... , or ...') at the beginning of the first
