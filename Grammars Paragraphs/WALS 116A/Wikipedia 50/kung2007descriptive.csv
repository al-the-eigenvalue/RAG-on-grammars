‘How does it (a tune) go?’[T0059: 012][T0066: 117]8.3.4 Tag Questions
A tag question may be formed in one of three ways: (i) using the tag
particle ta7as, (ii) using the tag clitic +7as, or (iii) using the negative particle
jaantu. The full form of the tag question ta7as occurs only clause-finally, as seen
below in the examples in (785), and it adds a tag question onto the end of the
clause.

‘But, yes, it sounded good, didn’t it?’575[T0066: 195-6]Though the tag question clitic +7as is a reduced form of the full tag ta7as,
its distribution is different. Whereas ta7as occurs only clause-finally, +7as
cliticizes onto the end of verbs (786), adverbs (787), and the negative particle
jaantu (788) regardless of their positions within the clause. When the tag question
cliticizes onto a verb or adverb, it may be translated as a tag question, e.g., ‘didn’t
it?’, ‘doesn’t it?’, or as ‘right?’ in English and ‘¿verdad?’ in Spanish. When +7as
cliticizes onto the negative particle, the result is a negative question, ‘didn’t +
clause’. Neither variant (ta7as or +7as) is used more frequently than the other,
and the choice of which to use seems to lie with the speaker.

[BeQ2]8.3 INTERROGATIVE STRUCTURES
All questions in HT are characterized by rising intonation. In addition,
there are various interrogative pronouns and tags that are used in the formulation
of questions.
8.3.1 Yes/No Questions
A yes/no question in HT is always formed using rising intonation.
Additionally, there is an interrogative pronoun jaa that occurs in the focus
position at the beginning of a clause, as seen below in the examples in (764) and
(765). The example in (764a) shows a declarative clause, and the example in
(764b) shows the corresponding interrogative version of the same clause.

or if this is the only verb that is licensed to appear in this rather idiomatic
expression. Examples are shown below in (767).

8.3.3 Omission of Interrogative Pronouns
The omission of the interrogative word jaa from yes/no questions is quite
common, as discussed above in Section 8.3.1. However, omission of the
interrogative pronoun is not limited to yes/no questions; it also occurs to a much
lesser extent in either/or, quantity, and open-ended questions, as seen in the
examples in (782), (783), and (784), respectively. In all examples, the
interrogative nature of the clauses is indicated by rising intonation.

8.2.2 Focus Particle waa
The HT focus particle waa precedes a pragmatically emphasized element
in a clause without directly influencing the element’s location within the clause. It
serves to highlight or draw attention to a clausal constituent. It most commonly
occurs before a verb, before a predicate nominal or adjective, and before the
answer to a wh-word question. However, it also occurs before other clausal
elements, as will be seen below.
The most obvious place in which one finds a focused element is in the
answer to a wh-word question. The focused constituent of the answer is the part of
the clause or phrase that plays the same grammatical role as the wh-word in the
corresponding question, as seen in the examples below in (748) through (751).207
These answers are actually doubly focused because they are preceded by waa and
they occur in clause-initial focus position. In the question in (748a), one person
asks another where he was. The answer in (748b), lak José Pollo ‘at José Pollo’s207 Please see Section 8.3 of this chapter for more information on interrogative structures.","[576, 577, 578, 579]"

All of the interrogative pronouns (i.e., wh-words) are listed in Table 39.
The interrogative pronoun always occurs in the focus position at the beginning of
a clause. The different pronouns have different restrictions regarding what type of
clause may follow; therefore, I discuss each interrogative word below.

question, jaa is also used to introduce an open-ended question whenever there is
no more specific interrogative pronoun that may be used. It is followed by a
matrix clause. Jaa is also the word that is used to ask someone to repeat him- or
herself. Examples are shown below in (768).

‘The turkey.’[T0066: 124]The use of the focus particle waa is not limited to focusing the answer of a
wh-word question. It can be used to pragmatically focus any constituent or
adjunct in any declarative clause that introduces new information or a new idea to
the discourse. When it appears in a clause that is not an answer to a question, it
precedes the clausal element in situ; that is, a focused clausal constituent is not
required to occur in clause-initial focus position in this construction if it is not the
answer to a question. The following examples demonstrate that waa may focus in
situ a predicate (754); a noun or a predicate nominal (755), a predicate adjective
(756), an adverb (757), a prepositional phrase (758), and a number (759).

8.2.1 Focus Constructions
In HT, when a clausal constituent is focused, it occurs in the clause-initial
position. Several different constructions in HT may be analyzed as focus
constructions, including left-dislocation, topicalization, clefting, and answers to
questions. The first three constructions are addressed in this section, and focused
answers are discussed in sections 8.2.2 and 8.3 below.
In an HT left-dislocation construction, a focused noun or noun phrase
occurs in the clause initial position, and it is co-referential with a pronoun in the
matrix clause. Examples are shown in (742); here the clause-initial noun (phrase)
is enclosed in square brackets, and subscripted <i> indicates co-reference. In all
of the examples of left-dislocation that I have found, the clause-initial noun
(phrase) is co-referential with the subject of the clause. I have found no examples
in which it is co-referential with the object of the clause.",[574]

"241show very little cross-linguistic variation in their use of irrealis modality, while
imperatives, futures, questions, and negations show much more cross-linguistic
variation with regard to irrealis mood (p. 376). Whereas counterfactuals and
conditionals cross-linguistically fall into the realm of “nonactualization”,
languages vary with regard to whether or not they treat imperatives, futures,
questions, and negation as actualized or nonactualized (384-6).93 Furthermore,
Palmer (2001) acknowledges that “the idea that notional features of realis and
irrealis are grammaticalized as the typological categories of Realis and Irrealis is a
useful one” (p. 2).
In the following discussion of mood, I draw a mood distinction between
realis and irrealis, and I use the term ‘irrealis’ for three reasons. First, there is only
one particular prefix, ka- and its allomorph 7a-, which is common to all but one of
the contexts in which the “irrealis” mood occurs. Second, all of the contexts in
which this prefix appears are included in both Chafe’s (1995) and Mithun’s
(1995) lists of irrealis contexts, and all of the structures in which it occurs are
contexts which are non-actualized in HT. Third and finally, “irrealis” is the name
used most frequently for the cognate prefix in other Totonacan languages (e.g.,
MacKay 1999; Watters 1988).9493 However, following Givón’s (1994) explication of the irrealis, all of the above mentioned
researchers—Bybee et al (1994), Chafe (1995), and Mithun (1995)—are mistaken in their
association of ‘realis’ with ‘real’ and ‘irrealis’ with ‘unreal’. He writes, “One unfortunate legacy
of the logic-bound approach to modality is the definition of the contrast between realis and irrealis
as a contrast between, respectively, ‘real’ and ‘unreal events” (p. 268-9). For Givón, the difference
between realis and irrealis is a cognitive difference in “subjective certainty” and a communicative
difference in “socially-negotiated meaning” (p. 269).
94 I should note that the grandfather of Totonacan linguistics, Norman McQuown, did not actually
give this prefix a name in his grammar of Coatepec Totonac (1990: 156).","[266, 267]"

Comparative and superlative constructions are formed in the same way in
HT, using the marker palay ‘more’, ‘better’. The only comparative or superlative
examples that I found in natural discourse are from a continuous passage of
conversation, shown below in example (803). In these examples, the marker palay
is shown in bold type, and the quality being compared is shown in italics. The
marker of comparison always precedes the quality being compared. Note that
none of these examples contains a standard to which the object in question (in this
case, a wooden board) is being compared. All other examples in this section are
from elicitation.",[609]

‘The fish (PL) stunk.’[TPWDB]HT split intransitivity can be modeled using the animacy hierarchy that
was introduced in example (244) of Section 3.1.1.5 and that is repeated below in
(260). First and second persons are equal to each other, and they outrank third
person animate arguments, which in turn outrank third person inanimate
arguments. With respect to split intransitivity, the pivot point occurs between
third person animate and inanimate; first, second, and third plural animate
subjects are co-indexed on the verb by nominative morphology, while third
person plural inanimates are co-indexed on the verb by the “accusative” prefix
lak-.
(260) HT Animacy Hierarchy and Split Intransitivity
1st & 2nd person >> 3rd person plural animate >> 3rd person plural inanimate
>>
Above I called this pattern an “emerging” one because I believe that this is
relatively new pattern in HT for various reasons. First, no other documented
Totonacan language exhibits patterns of syntactic or morphosyntactic split
217alignment or split intransitivity; instead they are all documented as being strictly
accusative in their syntax and morphology.
Second, the pattern of split intransitivity in Huehuetla Tepehua is an
elusive one because inanimate nominals are not obligatorily marked for plurality
nor are inanimate arguments obligatorily co-indexed on the verb. Furthermore,
though the pattern manifested itself in utterances that were spontaneously
produced by my consultants, it did not always emerge from—or withstand the test
of—elicited grammaticality judgments. I first found the split-intransitive pattern
in sentences that were spontaneously produced by my consultants; when I tried to
test the pattern during elicited grammaticality judgments, I found that in most
cases, both patterns (a strictly accusative one and a split one) were acceptable. For
example, my consultant had given me the example in (261a), in which the
intransitive verb is marked with lak-. Later, I offered the example in (261b), in
which the same verb is marked with ta-, and the example in (261c), in which the
verb is marked with both ta- and lak-. My consultant accepted both examples, and
he told me that all three have the same meaning.

consultant produced the example in (262b), with the same verb again marked with
lak-. When I tested the sentence in (262c), in which the same verb is marked with
ta-, he rejected it. Of course, this set of examples raises the question of why the
examples in (261b) and (261c) are grammatical while the example in (262c) is
not. And, if I asked the same set of questions of the same consultant on a different
day, would the answers still remain the same? These are questions for which I
currently do not have answers.

polysemous morphemes may give rise to grammatical change in a language (e.g.,
Heine, Claudi, and Hünnemeyer 1991; Hopper and Traugott 2003). The prefix
219lak- exhibits more polysemy than any other morpheme in Huehuetla Tepehua: this
prefix is used (i) to indicate multiple plurality of the subject of an intransitive
verb, as seen above in section 3.1.1.2, (ii) to indicate distributive action of a verb,
also seen in section 3.1.1.2, (iii) to co-index a third person plural object, as seen in
section 3.1.1.4, (iv) to mark plurality on inanimate and animate nouns (see
Chapter 4), and (v) to marked plurality on adjectives (see Chapter 5).
Fourth, the use of the prefix lak- as a verbal plural marker overlaps with
the use of 7a- as a verbal plural marker. There is evidence from Watters 1988 that
in Huehuetla Tepehua, the prefix 7a- was the default prefix to co-index a third
person plural object and that the prefix lak- sometimes co-occurred with 7a- and
sometimes did not. In my own data, the reverse is true in that (i) lak- co-indexes a
plural third person object, (ii) 7a- co-indexes an understood plural object on a
detransitivized verb and an indirect object, (iii) the two co-occur to co-index a
plural third person indirect object and/or a plural third person direct object if it
outranks the subject in animacy, and (iv) the two frequently co-occur without any
overt change in the meaning. Next, the use of lak- as a marker of distributivity
overlaps with the meanings of two HT suffixes: -pala, which marks repetitive
action of the verb (see Section 3.2.3.7) and –qoju, which indicates that the action
of the verb is distributed equally over all members of either the subject or object
argument, depending on the transitivity of the verb (see Section 3.2.3.9).
Finally, HT is a moribund language. The children are not learning it, their
parents do not use it, and their grandparents address them in Spanish and speak
Tepehua only amongst themselves. Once a language falls into disuse, the rate of220grammatical and phonological change escalates. I believe that this is what is
happening in HT. Given the polysemy of the morpheme lak-, plus the fact that HT
has other morphemes that provide similar (or the same) meanings as lak-, it is
quite possible that HT is undergoing a grammatical change that might result in an
unquestionable split in its alignment system.

The nominative person marking affixes are summarized in Table 13, and
the accusative affixes are summarized in Table 14. Note that several of the affixes

[T0057: 054]3.1.2.3 Mood
There are essentially two grammatical mood distinctions in HT, the realis
mood and the irrealis mood. The realis mood is formally and functionally
unmarked. The irrealis mood is indicated by the prefix ka- and its one allomorph
7a-.92 Different modalities (such as the imperative or the conditional) are
accomplished by combining the irrealis prefix with different tense and/or
aspectual markers.
Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca (1994) argue that the realis/irrealis
distinction “is not cross-linguistically valid” (p. 238); however Chafe (1995) and
Mithun (1995) have both taken the position that the distinction between realis and
irrealis is arguably valid, and that the term ‘irrealis’ is descriptively useful. Even
though the application of the term ‘irrealis’ varies from language to language (or
author to author), nevertheless, there are certain constructions which tend to get
labeled irrealis over and over again. Chafe lists the following contexts in which a
language might employ the irrealis mood: yes-no questions, negations, futures,
necessities (or obligations), possibilities, imperatives, prohibitions, and conditions
(p. 350, 362). According to Mithun, counterfactual and conditional structures
92 There is one irrealis form that is not marked by either ka- or 7a-; it will be dealt with below.","[264, 265, 266]"

[QMMES]The dubitative modality differs from the other irrealis modalities in one major
way: it is optionally used based on the speaker’s attitude toward the information
being conveyed, as demonstrated by the examples in (310) and (311). In the
example in (310a), the speaker is not sure if the person in question will come, and
he uses the dubitative modality. In the example in (310b), the speaker is more
confident that the person in question will come, which is reflected by his use of
the future tense.

choice of mood is available to the Tepehua speaker.

[QMMES]3.2 DERIVATION
Derivational operations in HT include operations that change the valency
of the verb stem (Section 3.2.1) and verb compounding (Section 3.2.2).
3.2.1 Valency-Changing Affixes
Valency-changing derivational affixes either decrease or increase the
valency of the verb. Valency-decreasing affixes in HT are the reflexive (3.2.1.1),
and the reciprocal (3.2.1.2). Valency-increasing affixes in HT are the dative
(3.2.1.3), the causative (3.2.1.4), the instrumental (3.2.1.5), the comitative
(3.2.1.6), the applicative (3.2.1.7), and the body part prefixes (3.2.1.8).
2553.2.1.1 Reflexive -kan
The reflexive suffix –kan is homophonous with the indefinite subject
suffix –kan. However, the reflexive suffix decreases the valency of the verb, as
seen below in (312). Both (312a) and (312b) have separate agent and patient
arguments; however, the reflexive suffix –kan in the clause in (312c), indicates
that the agent and the patient arguments have the same referent.

This chapter discusses the syntax of Huehuetla Tepehua, including the
following topics: the word order of the major clausal constituents (section 8.1),
focus (section 8.2), interrogation or question formation (section 8.3), negation
(section 8.4), comparative and superlative constructions (section 8.5), and
complex clauses (section 8.6).
8.1 WORD ORDER OF MAJOR CLAUSAL CONSTITUENTS
In this section, I examine the word order of the major clausal
constituents—subject, object, and verb—in HT. The order of the words in specific
types of phrase are discussed in the relevant chapters on verbs, nouns, modifiers,
adverbs, and numbers—chapters 3 through 7, respectively (e.g., the word order
within a noun phrase is discussed in Chapter 4: Nouns and Nominal Morphology).
While in the field, I found that during elicitation, the word order of my
probe clause—be it in Spanish or Tepehua—would influence the word order of
the HT clause of my consultant’s response. Thus, when I elicited the example
shown in (733a) with SVO word order, my consultant gave me an HT clause with
SVO word order. When I then tested all six possible word orders, my consultant
accepted all of them and claimed there was no difference in meaning. The
example is shown in its entirety below in (733).","[557, 558, 559, 560]"

In my own data, HT clauses are frequently coordinated by means of what
appears to be the evidential reportative particle maa.225 Nora England (p.c.)
suggests to me that this instance of maa is actually a conjunction that is similar to
the evidential clitic maa due either to homophony or to some historical change
that is not clear from a synchronic point of view. This could be the case because
when my consultant loosely translated passages that contained the particle maa,
he would translate maa as either y ‘and’ or segun ‘according to’. However, when I
asked for a specific translation of maa, he always translated it as segun. When I
explicitly tried to elicit a conjunction using conjoined clauses or phrases in
Spanish, my consultant would either use the Spanish conjunction y in the HT
clause or he would juxtapose the two clauses or phrases. He never used maa in
elicited examples. For this reason, I continue to gloss maa as the evidential
particle RPT in the examples that appear below in (833) and (834).
Setting aside the question of whether or not the particle maa is or is not
the evidential clitic, examples in which maa is used to coordinate two clauses
with the same subject are shown below in (833), and examples in which it is used
to coordinate two clauses with different subjects are shown below in (834). In all

"16I worked primarily with don Nicolás, and my first task was to teach him to
read and write my HT practical orthography. We spent much of the nine months
that I was there recording narratives and conversations with various community
members, then transcribing them and translating them into Spanish.
In a rural village, the mornings are the busiest time of the day for the
town’s people, who rise early to begin their daily tasks. The men go off to the
fields to work, while the women see their children off to school and hurry to get
some of the never-ending housework done before the children come home again
in the early afternoon. Thus, the mornings were never a good time for me to
search out consultants because no one—except don Nicolás—had time to work
with me.
Thus, don Nicolás and I spent our mornings transcribing and translating
texts. The first step in this process involved transcribing an entire HT text. Next
don Nicolás translated the HT text loosely into Spanish. Finally, we completed a
word-for-word translation together; this allowed me to analyze the words as we
worked and to conduct impromptu grammatical and semantic tests when I
encountered new forms.
In the early afternoons, there was a period of about two hours that fell
after most of the chores were done but before the children came home from
school. During these two hours, the whole town was very peaceful, and the adults
were resting. This was the best time of the day for me to go visiting other people
in the community in search of HT consultants. Thus, most afternoons, don17Nicolás and I would venture out into the town to record texts and word lists with
various community members.
In addition to transcribing and translating texts with don Nicolás, I also
conducted straight lexical and grammatical elicitation with him, often involving
one to three additional HT speakers in the sessions. I organized the grammatical
elicitation sessions based on topics suggested in Payne (1997) and issues that
came up during text transcription and translation.
Even though I worked with 50 different HT-speakers during the course of
my fieldwork, the bulk of the grammatical judgments on which this grammar are
based belong to don Nicolás; thus, this dissertation could be considered to be a
descriptive grammar of his idiolect, to some extent.
I used a Sony MZ-R30 portable mini-disk recorder and a Sony DCRTRV11 Digital Handycam to record digital video onto mini-DVs. I also used a
Marantz PMD222 Portable Cassette Recorder to copy and play back audio data,
and a dictophone transcription machine and foot pedal to transcribe the recorded
discourse. I used the SIL computer program Shoebox 1.0 (the DOS version that
was still used by the PDLMA) to database the collected data and to interlinearize
the texts, and I used Speech Analyzer (version unknown) to make spectrograms in
the field.
In addition to audio-recording narratives, texts, and conversation, I video
recorded the events of several of the town’s major holidays, including Candlemas
(Candelaria) and Mardi Gras (Carnaval). The data from my time in Huehuetla
include 53 transcribed and translated texts that vary in length from one to sixty18minutes and that fill over 800 notebook pages; seven untranscribed narrative
recordings; approximately 700 pages of notes from grammatical and lexical
elicitation sessions; 16 hours of audio recordings; and 12 hours of video
recordings.
In the summer of 2005, I returned to Catemaco to complete my third and
final summer for the PDLMA. This time, because of family obligations at home
in Texas, I spent only five weeks working on the project. Once again, don Nicolás
was my principal consultant. During this time, I finished direct elicitation of the
Bouquiaux Questionnaire. I tested all of the ethnobotanical and ethnozoological
terms in the database, then don Nicolás sorted them all into taxonomies. We went
through Melissa Bowerman’s Topological Picture Series (no date), which
produced positional verbs, relational nouns, and prepositional phrases. I elicited
color terms using a color chart (Hoogshagen and Hoogshagen 1993), and I
elicited smells using those listed in Enríquez (2004) for Papantla Totonac. We
used a large toolbox full of tools typically found in Mexican farming communities
to generate words for all of the various tools. I used the existing ethnozoological
terms in the database to elicit words for animal cries, noises, and movements. We
did not record any texts at all that summer, nor did we do any transcription or
translation. This was the first field summer that I did not work with notebooks. To
save time, I entered most of the data directly into the database, resorting to file
slips only occasionally.
In all I spent 14 months conducting field work on Huehuetla Tepehua. I
have so much data in notebooks, on file slips, on mini-(audio)-disks, on video,19even on random scraps of paper, that I feel like I will never have enough time to
analyze it all. After I returned from the field in 2001, it took me three years to
organize the small portion of the data that I have used to write this grammar.4
Even though I felt compelled to continue adding to the dictionary and
interlinearizing texts, I reached a point when I had to stop organizing and start
analyzing and writing. There are many gaps in the analyzed data presented here,
but I am sure that answers to the questions left by these gaps can be found
somewhere in the volumes that I have collected, if only I knew where to look.
Cecil Brown recently told me that it is only after the Ph.D. is done that the real
work begins. I know that I have my work cut out for me for years to come.
1.3 HUEHUETLA TEPEHUA AND THE TOTONACAN LANGUAGE FAMILY
Huehuetla Tepehua is a member of the Tepehua branch of the Totonacan
language family, which has only two branches, Tepehua and Totonac (see Figures
1 and 2 below). The Totonacan languages are spoken in the Mexican states of
Veracruz, Puebla, and Hidalgo, and the Totonac and Tepehua branches are
mutually unintelligible (MacKay 1999). Because so little documentation exists for
the Totonacan languages, it has not been possible to determine if this language
family is a linguistic isolate or if it is related to Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean, as
suggested by Greenberg (1987) and McQuown (1940, 1942). However, Kaufman
(2003) argued that the lexical cognates that exist between Totonacan and MixeZoquean are the result of contact rather than genetics.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"

[Q7]Classified numerals and quantifiers can occur as anaphors that refer to
some previously mentioned noun. According to Aikhenvald (2004), “all
classifiers are used anaphorically, that is, as proforms, for tracking referents in
discourse” (p. 110). In (712c), the classified quantifier pumalhuu is an anaphoric
expression that refers back to the noun lapanák that was mentioned in the
question in (711b); in (712b), the classified number laqat'uy anaphorically refers
to the beer that is the topic of the conversation from which this example is taken;
and in (712c), laqlhuu (a predicate adjective) anaphorically refers back to some
pesos (money) that were previously mentioned in the discourse.

"AcknowledgementsMy first and largest debt of gratitude goes to all of the speakers of
Huehuetla Tepehua who contributed in some way to this grammar. Without them,
this volume would not exist. I want to thank the Vigueras family, in particular, for
taking me into their home and making me a part of their family: don Nicolás, his
wife doña Fidela, their children Nico, Tonio, Mari, Carmelo, Martín, Lupe, and
Laurencio, and their daughter-in-law Isela. Not only do I have a home here in the
U.S., but I also have a home in Huehuetla with them. There was also the extended
family, who lived in the same courtyard area and who also took me in and gave
me free access to their homes and their lives: don Nicolás’ mother doña Angela,
his two brothers don Laurencio and don Miguel, their wives doña Fidela and doña
Juana, and all of their children.
My deepest and most heart-felt thanks are for my husband, Jon, and our
son, Shaun. Without their love, support, patience, and endless sacrifices, I never
would have been able to finish this grammar. I also want to thank my mom and
dad, who never failed to express their pride, and my father-in-law, a Ph.D.
himself, who continually encouraged my progress.vI have so many additional people to thank that I’m going to thank them in
chronological order, from the start of my graduate career. My fellow cohort
members: Carrie Clarady, Lynda Olman Walsh, David Quinto-Pozos, and Kim
Mellon Kight, for sharing both the good and the bad during the early years; I
wouldn’t have made it to candidacy without their friendship. Heidi Johnson, for
being a mentor to me every step of the way. Terry Kaufman and John Justeson,
for hiring me to work on the Project for the Documentation of the Languages of
Mesoamerica; they are responsible for my decision to work on Huehuetla
Tepehua and not on some other language. Mark Ferguson, for knowing the
location of the appendix in the human body, for insisting that I see a doctor, and
for, essentially, saving my life. Terry Kaufman (again), for teaching me how to do
lexical field work the “right way” and Roberto Zavala, for teaching me to do it the
fun way. Tony Woodbury, for serving as the principle investigator on my NSF
Dissertation Improvement grant, and for providing invaluable advice and support
while I was applying for fellowships. Thomas Smith Stark at the Colegio de
México and Roberto Herrerra Herrerra, formerly of the Universidad de las
Américas – Puebla, for serving as co-sponsors for my Fulbright-García Robles
fellowship. Roberto Herrerra Herrerra (again) and Mandy Holzrichter, for easing
my culture shock during my time in Cholula. Thom Smith Stark (again), his wife
María, my fellow Fulbrighter Jennifer Jolly, and her husband Chris Gonzales, for
providing me with two homes in Mexico City away from the field where I could
go to decompress (and speak English!). Dottie Herzog, for sharing her
unpublished Tepehua dictionary, as well as other unpublished data that she hadvicompiled on the language, and also for sharing her workspace in Huehuetla while
mine was being built. Mark Sicolli, for being there in Catemaco. Christina Willis
and Lynda de Jong Boudreault, for being two of the best friends that I’ve had
during this long gradual process, and for being my only two friends who could
really, fully understood the journey. Suzanne Johnson, for showing me that there
was more to life than just graduate school and linguistics (with or without the kids
in tow).
My fieldwork was funded by the following sources, and I thank them all:
Fulbright IIE (Fulbright-García Robles Fellowship for scholars), the National
Science Foundation (NSF Grant No. 0078453 with Anthony C. Woodbury, PI),
the Pan American Round Tables of Texas (Melba Brunno Dawson Scholarship),
and the Project for the Documentation of the Languages of Mesoamerica.
Most importantly, I want to thank my committee: Nora England, Carlota
Smith, Megan Crowhurst, Tony Woodbury, Jim Watters, and Paulette Levy for all
of their helpful comments, advice, encouragement, and words of praise (those
kept me going more than anything!), not to mention their time, especially since
this grammar turned out to be a lot longer than I had anticipated. My biggest
thanks go to Nora, who has been the best supervisor and mentor that I could have
hoped for! Most importantly, she insisted that this grammar be a thorough
treatment of the language since it might be the only treatment that Huehuetla
Tepehua will ever get.viiA Descriptive Grammar of Huehuetla Tepehua
Publication No._____________Susan Smythe Kung, Ph.D.
The University of Texas at Austin, 2007Supervisor: Nora C. EnglandThis dissertation is a comprehensive description of the grammar of
Huehuetla Tepehua (HT), which is a member of the Totonacan language family.
HT is spoken by fewer than 1500 people in and around the town of Huehuetla,
Hidalgo, in the Eastern Sierra Madre mountains of the Central Gulf Coast region
of Mexico. This grammar begins with an introduction to the language, its
language family, and its setting, as well as a brief history of my contact with the
language. The grammar continues with a description of the phonology of HT,
followed by morphosyntactic and syntactic description of all of the major parts of
speech, including verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and numbers; the grammar
concludes with a description of the sentence-level syntax. A compilation of
interlinearized texts appears in the appendix.
HT is a polysynthetic, head-marking language with complex verbal
morphology. Inflectional affixes include both prefixes and suffixes for which aviiitemplatic pattern is difficult to model. In addition to inflectional and derivational
morphology, HT verbs are also host to a large number of aspectual derivational
morphemes, each of which alters the meaning of the verb in a very specific way.
Plural marking on both nouns and verbs for any third person argument is optional
and determined by an animacy hierarchy, which is also used to determine verbal
argument marking in various morphosyntactic constructions. HT nouns are
completely unmarked for case, and certain nouns, including kinship terms and
parts of a whole, are obligatorily possessed. The order of the major constituents is
pragmatically determined, with a tendency towards VSO order in the absence of
pragmatic or contextual clues and SVO order in context-rich textual examples.
HT is an under-documented moribund language that is at imminent risk of
extinction within the next two-to-three generations. Thus, this dissertation is a
major contribution not only to the field of linguistics, but also to the Tepehua
people who might one day be interested in the language of their grandparents.ixTable of Contents

1.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE LANGUAGE
Tepehua is an under-documented, moribund, indigenous language that is
spoken in the Mexican towns of Huehuetla, Hidalgo and Mecapalapa Puebla.
Tepehua belongs to the Totonacan language family, which has two branches:
Tepehua and Totonac.1 The Totonacan languages are spoken in the Eastern Sierra
Madre mountain chain in the Central Gulf Coast region of Mexico where the
contiguous states of Hidalgo, Veracruz, and Puebla fit together like pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle. Illustration 1 is a map the geographical location of the Totonacan
language family within Mexico.

means ‘places’ or ‘areas’ (Beck 2004: 27; Levy 2004: 280; McQuown 1990: 136).
This classifier is homophonous with the HT locative prepositional prefix laka(see Chapter 6, section 6.6.1). Bower (1948) does not include the classifier
laka.191 Below in (682b) the classified number modifies the noun laqachaqan
‘town’, while in (682c), it modifies the verb toolay ‘lives’.

191 The locative preposition in most of the Totonacan languages is nak (Beck 2004: 13; McQuown1990: 125; Reid and Bishop 1974: 100) or naka (MacKay 1999: 435), but it is laka- in HT, laka
in Tlachichilco Tepehua (Watters 1988: 473), and [laka] in the Yecuatla dialect of Misantla
Totonac (MacKay 1999: 435). The question is this: is the preposition laka(a) an innovation in
these languages based on a Proto-Totonacan classifier laka-, or does the preposition laka(a) reflect
the Proto-Totonacan locative preposition, while the Totonac nak is the innovation?","[523, 524, 525]"

[NVP99/MNB7: 469]The fact that all of the word orders shown in (733) are acceptable is
problematic given that case is not marked on nouns in HT. However, given the
pragmatics of the clausal constituents, it is not difficult to determine that juu
7anu7 lapanak ‘that person’ must be the subject and juu qajin ‘the turtle’ must be
the object since it highly improbable that a turtle would eat a person. Word order
is not needed to determine the syntactic roles in this example.
However, the pragmatics of clausal constituents are not always so
enlightening, and it is easy to find a clause in which the meaning of the
constituents does not pragmatically or culturally influence the assignment of
syntactic roles. Two such clauses are shown below in (734). I want to point out
that the clauses in (734) were volunteered by a speaker with whom I did not
536perform word order tests; I elicited the verb and requested that he give me an
example clause using the verb. In each of these examples, the verb saa ‘hit’ cooccurs with two nominals that are culturally equal.204 It is neither more nor less
likely that John would hit a man than it is that a man would hit John. The clausal
pragmatics do not help to determine the syntactic roles of subject and object;
therefore a fixed word order is needed, and this word order is VSO.

[NVP05]To further check the word order, I took the clause in (734a), and I
rearranged its constituents to create six different clauses; I read all six HT clauses
to a native speaker and asked him to translate them into Spanish. The results are
shown in (735). When the verb was clause-initial, the clause-final nominal was
interpreted to be the object, as seen in (735) a) and (735b). When the verb was in
204 By culturally equal, I mean that one nominal is not expected to hit the other, unlike theexamples shown here in (i) and (ii) in which it is culturally expected that an adult would hit a
child, but not that a child would hit an adult. Note that the word order is VSO in (i), but VOS in
(ii).

[WOQ]In analyzing the statistical frequency of various word order possibilities in
Huehuetla Tepehua, I looked only at clauses from natural discourse (i.e., clauses
from the text database), and I did not include any of the examples that came from
elicitation sessions. Of the 1393 entries in the text database, only 940 predications
538were used to determine basic word order. The remaining entries were not used
because they were clausal fragments, one-word questions or answers, nonverbal
predicates (i.e., present tense predicate nominal or adjectival constructions that do
not require a copula), incomprehensible utterances, or solitary discourse markers,
or they were uttered entirely in Spanish.
Of the 940 usable clauses, 371 were intransitive and 569 were transitive.
Since there were so few samples with which to work, I looked at word order in
both transitive and intransitive clauses. Tables 31 through 34 describe the
statistical frequency of the word orders that I found.
Table 31 shows the various possible word orders in an intransitive clause.
The first column shows the possible word order combinations in an intransitive
clause: V-only, VS, and SV. The second column shows the statistical frequency
of all three types of intransitive clause. Of the 371 intransitive clauses 61.7%
consisted of a verb only. The subject followed the verb in 30.5% of the clauses,
and it preceded the verb in only 7.8% of the clauses. The third column subtracts
the V-only examples, and shows the frequency of the VS and SV examples. Of
the 142 intransitive clauses that contain an overt subject, 79.6% show the VS
word order, while only 20.4% show the SV word order. Thus, there is a strong
tendency for a subject nominal to follow an intransitive verb.","[560, 561, 562, 563, 564]"
"105falls on the penult (or antepenult in the case of some nominalized forms, see
section 2.5.1.4). Recall from section 2.4 that HT has both heavy and light closed
syllables: CVS and CVO,49 respectively, because sonorants in coda position are
moraic, while obstruents in coda position are not. Since vowel length is distinctive
in HT, the language also has both heavy and light opened syllables: CVV and CV.
What is interesting and unique about the HT stress pattern is that the heavy
opened syllable CVV behaves like the light syllables CV and CVO with respect to
stress assignment in that none of these three syllable types attracts primary stress.
Only the heavy closed syllable CVS attracts primary stress. Cross-linguistically, it
is typically the case that if a heavy closed syllable attracts stress, then a heavy
opened syllable will also attract stress (Zec 1995). However, this is not the case in
HT, and I do not know of any other language which exhibits this unusual stress
assignment pattern. Examples showing the contrast in stress between words
ending in CVS versus words ending in CVV, CVO, and CV are given in each of
the following subsections.
Examples of words from which an intervocalic /h/ has been deleted
provided evidence that primary and secondary stress assignment do not happen
simultaneously.50 Instead, /h/-deletion happens after primary stress assignment
and before secondary stress assignment. Simultaneous assignment of primary and
secondary stress, shown in the derivation in (78), produces ungrammatical forms
in which either (i) /h/-deletion fails to happen, which is the case with the first
example in this derivation or (ii) the secondary stress assignment is incorrect,
49 S stands for ‘sonorant’ and O stands for ‘obstruent’, following Zec (1995).
50 Please see section 2.6.9 for more information on /h/-deletion.","[130, 131]"

The question of how to determine which noun takes which plural affix
remains unanswered. I suspect that at one time nouns belonged to different noun
classes, each of which required a different plural affix. However, I believe that theuse of the prefix lak- is becoming the norm for pluralization, and that the suffixes
are slowly falling out of use. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that many
nouns that form their plurals with –nin or –(V)n, may alternately form the plural
by means of lak-, as seen below in the (a) and (b) examples of (469) and (470), or
even by means of both affixes, as seen in (470c).

The commonly used plural form of the noun lapának [la.pa.nak] ‘person’
is produced by means of a change in the stress pattern of the word: làpanák
[la.pa.nak] ‘people’. However, làpanák is likely a truncated form of the older
plural form làpanákni [la.pa.nak.ni] (see example (471) below). In my database,
làpanákni occurs only twice, and both occurrences are from a narrative about the
history of Huehuetla.

The pattern for possession in HT is head-marking (Nichols 1986): the
possessive affixes appear on the head noun (the possessum) rather than on the
352dependent noun (the possessor). When there is an overt nominal possessor, it
follows the possessum, as seen in (473).

Possessorxaa-(not possible)The person of the possessor is marked by means of prefixes on the possessum
(section 4.1.2.1 and 4.1.2.2) and the number of the possessor is marked by means
of a suffix on the possessum (section 4.1.2.3). Certain Tepehua nouns are
obligatorily possessed, while others are optionally possessed (section 4.1.2.4).
4.1.2.1 Person of the Possessor
First, second, and animate third person possessors (PR) are co-indexed on
a possessed noun (PM) by means of the possessive prefixes kin-, min-, and 7ixrespectively.
A first person possessor is indicated by the possessive prefix kin- and its
allomorphs ki- and kim-, and a second person possessor is indicated by the
353possessive prefix min- and its allomorphs mi- and mim-. The distributions of both
the first and second person allomorphs are exactly the same: ki- and mi- occur
before nasals and glides (474); kim- and mim- occur before /p/ and /p'/ (475); and
kin- and min- occur everywhere else (476). kin- and ki- are in free variation before
/7/ and a lateral consonant as seen in example (477).

There are two nominalizing suffixes that are widely and productively used
in HT to form non-agentive nouns from verbs: -ti (NOM1) and –nti (NOM2). To
summarize Watters (1988: 416-423), in Tlachichilco Tepehua, intransitive action
verbs form nominals by means of the suffix –ti, while transitive action verbs form
nominals by means of the suffix –nti (the indefinite object suffix –nVn, plus –ti).
Though both suffixes are found in HT, as well, the conditioning factors in this
language are not so cut-and-dried. While there are nominalizations of intransitive
action verbs formed by means of –ti, as seen below in (494), there are also
nominalizations of transitive action verbs formed by the same suffix, as seen
below in (495); however, there are far fewer of the transitive examples than there
are of the intransitive examples. Next, there are nominalizations of both transitive
365and intransitive verbs formed by means of the suffix –nti, as seen below in (496)
and (497), respectively. Furthermore, the verb does not have to be an action verb
to participate in this type of nominalization, as demonstrated by the example in
(497d). On the whole, -ti is far more productive and occurs on many more nouns
than –nti does; however, given the broad range of both nominalizing suffixes, the
conditions that determine the use of one over the other have yet to be determined.

"1042.5.1 Stress in Native, Non-ideophonic Words
HT has two degrees of stress: primary and secondary. Stress is assigned
from right to left. Primary stress may fall on the ultimate, penultimate, or
antepenultimate syllable of the word, depending on syllable codas, word length,
and word class. Secondary stress is assigned to alternate syllables in the
morphological word, moving from right to left starting at the syllable bearing
primary stress. The primary stress rule is as follows: stress the final syllable if it
ends in a sonorant (i.e., moraic)47 consonant or glide, otherwise, stress the penult.
The sonorant consonants are /m, n, l, r, / and the glides are /h, /, w, j/.48 Note
that /// is included in this group even though it is not typically considered to be a
sonorant; it is included in the sonorant class because it patterns like the other
sonorant consonants in that it adds weight to a syllable. Furthermore, it behaves
differently from the glottalized consonants /p’, t’, k’/, which do not occur
syllable-finally and which do not add weight to a syllable. Certain morphemes are
extrametrical and may not bear primary stress; these include the body part
prefixes, the third person plural subject and object markers (ta- and lak-,
respectively), the instrumental prefix paa-, and the nominalizing suffix –ti. These
prefixes may bear secondary stress, but the suffix never does.
An alternative way to state the stress rule is to specify that primary stress
falls on the final syllable only if that syllable has a moraic coda; otherwise, stress
47 Recall from section 2.4 that the sonorant consonants are moraic when they occur at the end of a
syllable.
48 Though the rhotics /r, / are included in the group of sonorants, I do not have any evidence that
they do or do not attract stress. They occur only in a few ideophones and in Spanish loan words,
both of which have different stress patterns from the pattern discussed here. Please see sections
2.5.2 and 2.5.3. respectively.","[129, 130]"

In all modalities but one, the irrealis mood is morphologically marked by
the prefix ka- or its allomorph 7a-. According to Watters (1988), in Huehuetla
245Tepehua, the irrealis prefix ka- is used when the subject is third person or first
person plural inclusive, and the allomorph 7a- is used when the subject is first
person singular, first person plural exclusive, and second person (p. 273). I, too,
found that the allomorph 7a- can be used when the subject is first person singular,
first person plural exclusive, or second person; however it is frequently the case
that no irrealis prefix at all occurs with these persons. My consultant, don Nicolás,
told me that it is more correct to include the 7a- prefix, but that it is usually
omitted in fast speech. In fact, I found that it almost never occurs in naturally
occurring speech, but that it is always accepted when presented during elicitation.
Irrealis modalities include the future tense (both positive and negative) and
obligation, imperative and hortative commands, permission, the optative (wishes),
the conditional, and the dubitative (doubt or uncertainty on the part of the
speaker). The irrealis prefix does not occur on the verb when any of these
modalities occur in the past; the past tense prefix x- occurs on the verb instead.
The irrealis mood maker ka- combines with the future suffix –ya7 (~ -a7)
to form the future tense (see the subsection on Future Tense in Section 3.1.2.1).
Though the future tense is not necessarily a modality, obligation is, and it happens
that the future tense and obligatory mood are the same in HT. Positive examples
are shown in (296).

247[QMMES]The imperative, hortative, permissive, optative, conditional, potential, and
dubitative modalities are all morphologically marked in the same way: they are
prefixed with the irrealis marker ka- and suffixed with the perfective aspect
marker –lh. If they occur in the past tense, the irrealis prefix is replaced by the
past tense prefix x-. Even though there is no grammatical difference in these
modalities, there is a slight semantic difference. Examples of each modality
follow.
As stated above, the imperative mood is formed by the combination of the
irrealis prefix and the perfective suffix. The irrealis prefix occurs as 7a- in the
imperative (i.e., a second person command). The prefix is omitted frequently in
regular speech, though (i) forms that bear the prefix are always accepted during
elicitation, and (ii) these irrealis forms are considered to be more correct.
Examples of second person singular commands are shown in (298), and examples
of second person plural commands are shown in (299). Note that any stops or
affricates in the stem are glottalized.

indicated by deletion of the stem-final nasal. Given the fact that the prefix kaoccurs on the verb, this is an example of the first person inclusive since the irrealis
allomorph 7a- occurs with first person prefix k- [ak-] to form the exclusive.","[270, 271, 272, 273, 274]"
"Given the phonetic similarity between the root spulu ‘crunching’ in
(562d)—which is suffixed with –k’u—and the root lhpupu ‘sparking’ in (562e)—
which is suffixed with –7o, the two variations of this suffix do not seem to be in
complementary distrubution. I did not explicitly test for this morpheme during my
field work, so I do not have enough examples of either of the variants to be able to
determine what conditions their variation. Also, I have a strong sense that many
410of these adjectives are lexicalized because I cannot identify the root in the
majority of the examples that I have. An obvious explanation for the variation
between -k'V and and -7V (*-q’V) is one of a symbolic phonemic variation
between /k/ and /q/ (see Chapter 2, section 2.6.10), given the prevelant use of
symbolic phonemic variation within the language; however, my database does not
contain any instances of both variations being used on the same stem. The same
variation between “allomorphs” of this cognate suffix is found in Papantla
Totonac. While Levy does not offer an explanation for the variation, she has
found contrasting lexical minimal pairs involving the two cognate variants (1992:
276), indicating that in PT, at least, the variants are not allomorphs and that
symbolic phonemic variation alone can not explain the variation.
When the adjectivizer follows the –ni allomorph of the derverbalizer, it
always occurs as –k’a, as seen in the examples in (563).

‘thick, dense’ (ADJ)[MNB13: 94]The following set of examples shown in (564) are all derived from the

and its derivation are shown in (564b). The example in (564c) shows soqnik’a as411a non-verbal predicate adjective.167 In example (564d), I attempted to use
soqnik’a as an attributive adjective modifying a head noun in a noun phrase; my
consultant found this usage to be grammatically questionable, but he did not reject
it outright. When I tried to inflect soqnik’a with the third person plural subject
marker ta-, my consultant rejected the example, shown in (564e). The example in
(564f) shows that the predicative adjective is pluralized by means of the plural
prefix lak- when the subject of the predicate is plural. The examples in (564g) and
(564h) are interesting because they demonstrate that when the copula is used, the
adverbial form soq is used instead of the adjectival form soqnik’a; this could be
due to a restriction on the part of speech of words that may precede a verb given
that the syntactic position immediately before the verb is normally occupied by an
adverb, an adverbial particle, a noun, or a discourse marker.

I chose a subset of six male speakers based on their ages and the quality of
the recordings. They ranged in age from 15 to 80 years old. I did not initially
divide these speakers into groups. Using the computer program Speech Analyzer,
I made spectrograms of all of the individual tokens for each of the six speakers. I
74examined the spectrograms of the “uvular” words for phonetic evidence of uvular
phonemes, and I compared the spectrograms of these “uvular” words with the
spectrograms of the words that indisputably contained glottal stops. On a
spectrogram, a stop produces a gap in the pattern formed by the formants of the
vowels. The locus of closure of a glottal stop does not effect the formant
structures of the contiguous vowels; thus, a glottal stop between two vowels is
transparent to the transition between those two vowels. A uvular stop, on the other
hand, does affect the formant structures of the contiguous vowels by producing a
narrowing of the distance between formant 1 (F1) and formant 2 (F2), with a high
F1 frequency and a low F2 frequency, at the beginning of a following vowel or at
the end of a preceding vowel’s formants (Bessell 1998).
Comparison of all of the spectrograms revealed that there were three
different age-groups representing three different pronunciation patterns. The
speakers, their ages, and their groupings are shown in Table 8.

15Group 1, with two members, represents the oldest group, with speakers
ranging in age from 76 to 80 years old. Group 2, with only one member, is the
middle group; the sole member was 62 years old at the time of recording. Group
753, the youngest group, has three members who ranged in age from 15 to 44 years
old.
The speech patterns that I found were the following: the plain uvular stop
was still present in all environments (both contrastive and non-contrastive) in the
speech of the members of Group 1; however, it consistently alternated with the
glottal stop. When uttering the lexemes that historically contained a uvular stop,
each member of Group 1 consistently pronounced the first token of each lexeme
with a glottal stop. When I asked him to repeat himself, he pronounced the second
token of that lexeme with a uvular stop. Thus, the uvular and glottal stops were in
free variation in the speech of Group 1.
For Group 2, I found that in both the contrastive and the non-contrastive
environments, /q/ was only sporadically and unpredictably maintained prevocalically, while it never occurred post-vocalically. Furthermore, the uvular stop
never manifested itself in the first token, only in the second, repeated, token, and
sometimes not even then. Thus, /q/ and // are in free variation pre-vocalically,
and /q/ has merged with // post-vocalically in the speech of the sole member of
Group 2.
Finally, there was no spectrographic evidence of a uvular stop in any of
the tokens uttered by members of Group 3. In their speech, the uvular stop had
been completely replaced by //.
Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to distinguish a plain from a
glottalized stop using spectrograms, and I am told that the test to distinguish plain
stops from glottalized ones is quite invasive (Scott Myers p.c.). I was limited to76using my ear to distinguish a plain uvular stop from a glottalized one. The 76year-old speaker AVH spent a summer working with me on the Project for the
Documentation of the Languages of Mesoamerica. During that summer neither I,
nor any of the more experienced linguists with whom I worked on the PDLMA
(including Terrence Kaufman, Roberto Zavala, and Thom Smith Stark), could
detect a glottalized uvular stop in his speech.
In conclusion, the uvular stop is merging with the glottal stop and is
retained only sporadically in the speech of the oldest (older that 60) HT speakers.
Today, the presence of a plain uvular stop in an HT speaker’s phonemic inventory
falls on an age-graded continuum: the younger the speaker, the less likely he is to
have uvular stops in his phonemic inventory. In the speech of the younger HT
speakers, the uvular stop has been completely replaced by the glottal stop.
This merger has two consequences for the HT: first and most obviously,
the uvular stop is no longer a separate phoneme because (i) it is in free variation
with glottal stop in the speech of the older speakers and (ii) it is no longer a part
of the phonemic inventory of “younger” HT speakers. Second, in ProtoTotonacan and in some present-day Totonac languages, the presence of a
contiguous uvular stop conditions the lowering of /i, i/ and /u, u/ to [, ] and [o,
o], respectively. In these languages, /i(), u()/ are in complementary distribution
with [(), o()] (Arana 1953; MacKay 1999; among others). However, even
though the HT speakers have lost the uvular stop, they have retained the mid
vowels in the lexemes that historically contained uvular stops. Thus, in modern
HT, the mid vowels are contrastive with the high vowels.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102]"

[Q3I]3.1.2.2 Aspect
There are three inflectional aspects in HT: the imperfective aspect, the
perfective aspect, and the perfect aspect.
Imperfective Aspect
According to Smith (1997), “the unmarked imperfective spans an interval
that is internal to the situation” (p. 73). In HT, the imperfective aspect is used in a
verbal predication that is unbounded, ongoing, incomplete, or habitual. The
predication may refer to an event or a state.
The imperfective aspect suffix –y has one allomorph, -7a. The –y
allomorph occurs after a vowel-final stem as seen in (273a); the -7a allomorph
occurs after a stop-final stem, shown in (273b) and (273c). Continuant-final stems
are not overtly marked for imperfective aspect, as seen in (273d), where the stem
ends in a nasal consonant, and in (273e), where the stem ends in a non-nasal
continuant consonant.

According to Smith (1997), “sentences with a perfective viewpoint present
a situation as a whole. The span of the perfective includes the initial and final
endoints of the situation: it is closed informationally” (p. 66). Furthermore,
stative situations do not appear in the perfective viewpoint. In HT, only verbs that231refer to an event (and not a state) may be inflected for imperfective aspect, and
these events are temporally bounded within an initial and a final endpoint.
The perfective aspect in Huehuetla Tepehua is morphologically marked
by the suffix –li and its allomorph –lh.86 More importantly, however, perfective
aspect is indicated phonologically by a stressed penultimate syllable, and I will
return to this point below. The allomorph –lh is phonologically derived from the
allomorph –li by means of neutralization.87 The allomorph –li surfaces only when
(i) it is followed by the temporal clitic +ch, and (ii) it follows a consonant or
semi-vowel (-li never follows a vowel). Examples are shown in (275).

prefixes (BPPs) and subject and object third person plural markers. Examples of
verbs bearing body part prefixes are shown below in (85). In (85a) the stress falls
on the penultimate syllable of a three-syllable word because the final syllable ends
in a non-sonorant consonant. The first syllable of this word is a body part prefix.
In (85b), the word has been reduced to two syllables by the removal of reflexive
suffix -kan; the first syllable is a body part prefix, which may not bear primary
stress. Thus, in this example, the primary stress must occur on the final syllable,
even though it ends in the non-sonorant consonant []. Additional examples of
primary stress on verbs bearing body part prefixes are shown in (85c). Though the
BPPs are extrametrical with respect to primary stress assignment, they may bear
secondary stress, as seen in the final two examples in (85c).

Person prefixes that indicate a third person plural subject (ta-) and object(lak-) do not bear primary stress, as seen in the examples below in (86).
According to the stress rule, if the word does not end in a sonorant consonant, the
penultimate syllable should carry the primary stress. However, in each example in
(86), the verb ends in two non-sonorant consonants, and the final syllable bears
the primary stress even though we would expect the stress to fall on the
penultimate syllable. In (86a) the third person plural subject prefix ta- is the
penult, but it may not bear primary stress, and in (86b) the third person plural
object prefix lak- is the penult, but it may not bear primary stress either.

"115With respect to syllable weight and stress, we once again find the pattern
in which a heavy CVS syllable attracts primary stress in word-final position while
the other three syllable types (CVV, CVO, and CV) do not. All of the examples of
words with ultimate stress in (93) end in a sonorant consonant (CVS), while all of
the examples of words with penultimate stress in (94) end in one of the other
syllable types.
2.5.1.4 Stress in Nouns
Nouns follow the same primary stress rule as the other word classes: stress
the final syllable if it ends in a sonorant consonant, otherwise stress the penult.
Secondary stress is assigned to alternate syllables from right to left, starting at the
syllable bearing primary stress. Examples of nouns with word-final stress appear
in (95), and examples of nouns with penultimate stress appear in (96). Once again,
we see the stress pattern in which the CVS syllable behaves differently in wordfinal position than the other syllable types do. All of the words in (95) end in a
sonorant consonant (CVS), and they all have ultimate primary stress. The words
in (96) end in one of the other three syllable types (CVV, CVO, CV), and these
words all have penultimate stress.

these are nouns that end in the nominalizing suffix –ti [-ti#], examples of which
appear below in (99). The examples in (99a) all have antepenultimate stress,119where the stress rule would predict penultimate stress because the final syllable
does not end in a sonorant consonant. However, not all nominals ending in –ti
actually violate the stress rule; the nominalized examples shown in (99b) do not
end in a sonorant consonant, and they exhibit the expected penultimate stress. The
examples in (99a) do not follow the stress rule because the nominalizing suffix –ti
is extrametrical with respect to primary stress assignment. Since <–ti> is invisible
to stress assignment, the assignment of primary stress will begin with the
penultimate syllable, which is the final syllable disregarding <–ti>. If that syllable
does not end in a sonorant consonant, as is the case for the examples in (99a), then
the antepenultimate syllable is stressed. If the penultimate syllable ends in a
sonorant consonant, as is the case for the examples in (99b), then it is stressed.

examples in (100a) show word-final stress where the stress rule predicts
penultimate stress. The first form lapanak ‘people’ is a lexicalized form from an
older form lapanakni [la.pa.nak.ni], which bears a nominalizing suffix -ni that is
120cognate in other Totonacan languages and that is falling into disuse in modern
HT; this older, nominalized form does show the expected stress pattern.
Furthermore, the singular form lapanak [la.pa.nak] ‘person’ also exhibits the
expected stress pattern. The second form tankilhak [ta.ki.ak] has an older
form, tankilhakni (Herzog no date), that also ends in the nominalizing suffix -ni;
the stress pattern is retained from this older form. The final form najatz ‘nine’ has
lexical stress.

phones (as well as their stress patterns), and I suspect that they loanwords, though
I do not know their origins.54 As will be seen in the next section, when loanwords
are incorporated into HT, their native stress pattern is maintained—at least when54 The goat is not native to the Americans; it was introduced after the Spanish Conquest.","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"

[T0069: 310]According to Watters (1988), hun (which is imperfective) means
‘become’, while huniita (which is perfect aspect) means ‘be’ (p. 57). Because the
majority of the copular examples in my database are in the perfect aspect and
clearly mean ‘be’, as seen in the examples above in (409) through (411), I had to
elicite examples of ‘become’ (using the Spanish se hizo ‘he became X’ and se
hicieron ‘they became X’). This task successfully produced examples that were
not in the perfect aspect and that mean ‘become,’ as seen in the examples in
(413). The example in (413a) is in the perfective aspect, while the example in
(413b) is in the past tense imperfective aspect. The aspectual contranst mirrors the
chronological contrast: the process of becoming old is a long-term, on-going
process, so it occurs in the imperfective aspect, while the process of becoming a
mother is much more abrupt and less transitional.

With respect to the first type of consonant cluster, [stop] + [fricative] or

and // occur before /s/, /p/ and /t/ do not; all stops except /t/ occur before //; and
only /q/ and // precede /ts/. All stops occur before //, making its paradigm the
only complete one. Furthermore, there are no lexical examples at all in which a
stop is followed by /t/ in the coda. I do not know if these gaps in the paradigm
represent disallowed consonant cluster combinations or if they represent gaps in
my data.
Though I have found no lexicalized forms that end in a [stop] + /t/
cluster, there are many lexicalized forms that end in a [nasal] + /t/, as seen in the
examples in (65b). However, I have found no examples of a [nasal] + /ts/ cluster

The temporal clitic +ch (ALD), shown above in (65c), may follow
inflected verbs ending in // or /n/ and words of other classes that end in /n/. I

"56I digitized each lexical item using the computer program Sound Scope
(version unknown), in which I used 6 dB pre-emphasis and set the other
spectrogram settings as follows: 1024 FFT points, filter at 184 Hz (8ms) for a
man’s voice, and 0.000 to 3.000 kHz display range.
I spread each waveform out to 50 msec before making a spectrogram of it.
I then measured F1 and F2 for every occurrence of each vowel. In order to take
F1 and F2 measurements, I estimated the center point (in both time and
frequency) of F1, and took a measurement there. Next I estimated the mid-point
in Hz of F2 and took the measurement directly above the mid-point where I had
taken the F1 measurement (i.e., along the same time line). After measuring the F2
mid-point, I also measured the beginning and end times of F1. I saved all
measurements in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, grouped by phoneme.
After I had completed digitizing and measuring the data, I ended up with
94 tokens of /a/ (the most commonly-occurring vowel in the data set), 22 tokens
each of /i/ and /u/, 20 tokens of /o/, and 14 tokens of /e/ (the least commonlyoccurring vowel in the data set). I arbitrarily decided to limit the data to 20 tokens
of each of the vowels /i/, /a/, /o/, and /u/ and 14 tokens of the vowel /e/.
Table 4 shows the mean and the standard deviation of each of the five HT
vowels. The means of the five vowels are plotted in Illustration 10.","[81, 82]"

[T0066: 049]Second person
A second person singular subject is indicated on the verb by means of
glottalization of any stops and affricates that occur in the stem, as seen below in
(197a). The glottal approximate /h/ <j> becomes a glottal stop // <7> when the
subject is second person, shown in (197b). When the word has no glottal
approximates or plain stops or affricates, there is no indicator of second person in
the imperfective aspect, as seen in (197c). In these instances, the subject of the
clause is ambiguous between second and third person singular given that third
person singular is not overtly marked on the verb.

suffix –t'i, shown in (198a), or it is morphologically unmarked, as seen in (198b).
Please see the Section 3.1.2.2 on the Perfective Aspect for more information
regarding second person marking in the perfective aspect. Note that the example
in (198a) is doubly marked for a second person subject: may means of
glottalization of the stop [k’], as well as by the suffix –t’i.

(199c), respectively.

‘You (PL) sweep.’[MSW]A plural second person subject is additionally marked in the future tense
by the suffix –7i, which occurs after the future suffix and before –t'it, as seen in
the examples in (200a) and (200b). According to Watters (1988), both singular
and plural second person subjects are co-indexed by –p'i in Tlachichilco Tepehua
in the future tense. Furthermore, he states that this suffix occurs as –7i in the
singular in Tlachichilco Tepehua, but that it occurs as –p'i in Huehuetla (p. 317). I
did not find this to be the case. The HT speakers with whom I worked never used
–p'i, and they used –7i only with plural second person subjects and never with
singular ones. The example in (200c) shows that –7i does not occur when the
subject is second person singular.
