"Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 7gbé áwà [gbáwà]
kill dogdé óràn
buy wood[dóràn]Verbs defined by a single nasal vowel reflect a second pattern. In pronunciation, the
vowel itself is omitted but its nasal quality is retained and assumed by the initial
vowel of the ensuing noun phrase. Again, phonetic and orthographic representations diverge.
sén áwà [sánwà]
stab dogtón ímòhè [tínmòhè]
bury menStill a third phonetic pattern is exhibited by verbs with a sequence of identical vowels (koo ‘read’). In pronunciation, the sequence shortens when a lexical direct object
follows; it does not elide entirely. Comparison to a single vowel verb (ko ‘plait’)
illustrates the contrast. Orthographic presentation of each verb is consistent with its
citation form.
kóó ébè [kóébè]
read bookkó
émà [kémà]
plant yamLastly, verb final vowels do not elide when followed by a pronominal direct object.
sá óì [sáóì]
fetch itgbé óì [gbéóì]
kill itOrthographic and broad phonetic representations exhibit varying degrees of
congruency in the case of word formation. Since both vowel elision and glide formation are evident in the pronunciation of compounds and nominalizations, identification of morpheme elements is often obscured by vowel omission. To maintain
some level of morpheme transparency in orthographic practice, elided vowels in
compounds and nominalizations are accounted for in two ways.
Nominalized word forms in pronunciation exhibit no major incongruency relative to orthographic practice. Nouns derived from a verb by prefix addition, show no
vowel elision.
àòó ‘thought’
èkpà ‘vomit’oo ‘to think’
kpa ‘to vomit’Compound forms, however, pose potential problems for orthographic practice.
Vowels at word boundaries within compounds are subject to elision. When the verb
in a verb-noun compound is transitive (e.g. ze ‘scrape,’ da ‘drink’), its single vowel8 | Orthography and grammatical overviewis elided. Comparison of forms for ‘barber’ and ‘drunkard’ reveal how only the
sound shapes of prefix and noun, but not verb, are consistent across broad phonetic
form and orthographic practice.
òzètò
[ò-ze-étò]
‘barber’ prefix-scrape-hairòdènyò
[ò-da-ényò]
‘drunkard’ prefix-drink-wineElision also affects nasal vowels in verb-noun compounds but not in the manner
evident in syntactic constructions. Whereas only the vowel of a verb is elided in
syntactic phrases, both the vowel and its nasal quality (e.g. ken ‘divide’ and kpen ‘be
next to’) tend to be effaced in compounds.
ákèvà
[á-ken-èvá]
‘twin kernels’ prefix-divide-twoókpòkhúnmí [ó-kpen-òkhùnmì]
‘upward’
prefix-be.next.to-topIn compounds, non-nasal vowels elide and are not rendered orthographically. In
noun-noun compounds, orthographic practice and broad phonetic rendering align,
except for the final vowel of the compound’s left constituent.
ákòísí' [àkò
òísí']
‘holster’ sheath gunákùhàì [àkò
ùhàì]
‘quiver’ sheath arrowElision is also evident in word formation involving reduplication. Forms referring to relationships of time and space involve reduplication of an entire root (e.g.
ésè ‘center of’ and édè ‘day’), with accompanying elision of the initial constituent’s
morpheme-final vowel. Orthographic practice shows the vowel as elided.
ésèsé
[ésè-ésè]
‘direct center of’
ésè
‘center of’èdèdé
[édè-édè]
‘moments ago’
édè
‘day’Pronunciation of phrasal compounds also reflects glide formation. The final
close vowels of augmentative údù and diminutive úvbì, when preceding a vowel,
assume a glide shape. Orthographic practice retains the corresponding vowel.

Basic grammatical relations in Emai show the order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
Declarative statements with transitive verbs reveal a subject noun phrase (ólí ómòhè
‘the man’) followed by a verb (é ‘eat’) and its direct object (ólí émàè ‘the food’).
(1) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè.
the man PRP.eat the food
‘The man has eaten the food.’
Sentence types contrast with respect to voice-register and tonal pattern. Imperative
constructions utilize a normal voice register.
(2) è ólí émàè.
eat the food
‘Eat the food.’
Declaratives rely on a normal voice register as well.
(3) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè.
the man PRP.eat the food
‘The man has eaten the food.’
However, polar interrogatives (yes/no questions), while manifesting the same word
order as declaratives and essentially the same tonal patterns, employ a higher pitch
register.
(4) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè?
the man PRP.eat the food
‘Has the man eaten the food?’
Rhetorical questions are also expressed through this higher register, adding a final
extra-high tone (e.g. é) to a lexical low tone (émàè).
(5) ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàèé?
the man SC C eat the food
‘The man is eating the food, is he?’10 | Orthography and grammatical overview1.6 Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution
Tonal configurations in Emai reveal the interaction of lexical tone with syntactic
tone values derived from grammatical categories and their placement. Traditional
phrase heads such as nouns and verbs exhibit tonal variability controlled by presence or absence of modifying constituents or of adjacent phrases. For purposes of
illustration, we rely on noun phrases and monotransitive or ditransitive verb
phrases to convey an overview of the nature of this variability, although a full account of principles underlying sentence, clause and phrase tone remains to be undertaken.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
"980 | Sample oral narrativeIonlesen then said, “Aaegbe, I say bring your leg.” So they exchanged legs with
each other. Each leg locked into place. Aaegbe then said, “It isn’t so, is it?” Aaegbe
then said, I want to bathe. So she bathed don’t you know. Ionlesen picked out her
things. She then said, “I am coming, in order to enter the room.” After she glanced
about, she did not see Aaegbe. So she started to sing a song.
SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
Don’t you see it? One does not lead another one on to some place, as might be
thought. I wonder whether you are seeing it. As a result, Ionlesen picked out her
things. She approached the door. She then said, “A group of young men of this
kind.’ She then said, “I ask you for the person I am searching for.” One said, “Who
are you surely searching for?” Ionlesen said, “Who do you surely search for?” Ionlesen then said, “Aaegbe.” One said, “It is beauty that has overtaken her.” Another
said, “Yes, Aaegbe, she picked out her things just recently, she proceeded to Afuze,
don’t you know.” Ionlesen also put her legs to walking.
SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
“A plight,” Ionlesen then said, “A plight is this one. Aaegbe.” Ionlesen started
walking. She reached Afuze. One said, “Just recently Aaegbe came out from this
room. When you see her, she and the men, she took the men to her. When they position each other noisily, they crash onto the ground from the bed. They make noises
with their bodies. They crash on the ground from the bed. They make noises with
their bodies. They thump on the mat.” One said, “How will one deal with this one?”
One said, “Aaegbe, I say that she just came out recently. She proceeded to Otuo.”
Ionlesen said yes, it is walking that I have started. I intend to do goodness, I do it
but what do I get in return? So she started to sing a song.
SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
Don’t you see it? So Ionlesen reached Otou. After she reached Otuo, she encountered young men assessing each other. Some were jumping away at the window. She
then said, “I ask you please, rescue me.” One asked her, “What happened to you?”
She said, “It is Aaegbe I search for.” One said, “Aaegbe? She just picked up herTwo Women, a Wound and a Rag | 981things recently, she proceeded to Benin City.” Ionlesen said that the place where I
should happen to move to is the place where I start out from. So Ionlesen then
picked out her things.
SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not

It is just so, isn’t it? So Ionlesen started on her journey, briskly moving on. So
she reached Benin City, don’t you know. After she reached Benin City, she encountered that the entirety of the young men, they were seething a great deal. Sweat was
overcoming everyone completely on their shoulder blade. Ionlesen said, “How?”
Ionlesen said, “I say that it is Aaegbe I am searching for.” One said he took one
woman who was beautiful in that way just recently. Another said, “Yes, she picked
out her things. She said she was going to Lagos.” Ionlesen then said, “Is it I who am
this one? The wound will infest me today. I will be infested by this wound today.
The wound, it is, Aaegbe then told me, take, hold it for me. I held the wound for her.
It is an act of goodness that I performed.” So Ionlesen walked to Lagos.

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not

That is how it is. There passed one market week, one fortnight, walking is what
Ionlesen did. It is she. Her toes were about to wither away on the road to Lagos. “I
will just ensure that I will see her today.” Ionlesen, she shuffled into Lagos. The
people said, “Greetings.” Another said, “Greetings.” This one said, “Greetings.” She
then said, “This thing you speak, this is not the language I know. I say that it is a
person I search for. There is no one who will give me a helping hand?” One said,
“Whom do you search for?” She said, “One small girl that is called Aaegbe.” One
said, “Go into that room, you will meet her in there.” So Ionlesen entered the room
don’t you know. It was men she met. She said, “I ask you about the woman you
carried into this room.” One said, “Yes, it is Aaegbe who proceeded to Ajegunle and
entered inside Lagos. What? Ajegunle inside Lagos.” “Is it Ajegunle that she now
entered?” He then said, “It is just so.”

"7.6.2 Negation ki
Sentence negation (SN) constructions are framed by clause initial ki. They negate an
entire proposition, specifying that it is not shared by speaker and hearer as true. The
construction takes the form of a polar interrogative or a declarative with an obligatory contrary-to-expectation interjection ò. Consequently, ki either queries the proposition expressed in the interrogative with an assumption of doubt or contravenes
the interjection framed declarative structure.

‘Isn't it the case that the man slept?’
d. kí ólí ómóhé méhén'-ì

SN the man PAP.sleep-F INT
‘It isn't the case the man slept, even though you expect he did.’
A response to interrogative ki constructions is hèè ‘yes’ followed by an affirmative
declarative, or òghò ‘no’ followed by a negative statement.

of auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding preverbs, SN imposes severe restrictions. It
rejects all preverbs: aspectualizer, evaluative, temporal, subject attributive, quantity
and manner-demonstrative. SN ki constructions partially limit aspect. They inflect
for Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective. Thus they disallow
Present perfect, Continuous imperfect and Anticipative prospective.

In ki matrix clauses modality auxiliaries are restricted absolutely. One finds neither deontic (Hortative í) nor epistemic (Certaintive ma, Dubitative vba and bia,
Deductive za, Resultative za, Concessive rere, Hypothetical kha). Hypothetical kha
illustrates (*kí ólí ómóhé khà gbé ófè? [SN the man PAP.HYP kill rat] ‘Isn’t it the case

SN ki clauses completely reject relative tense ke and kpe, as ke shows (*kí ólí
ómóhé ké' gbé ófè? [SN the man PAP.ANT kill rat] ‘Isn’t it the case that the man
killed a rat afterwards?’).
SN ki clauses constrain subject shape. They allow proper nouns (òlóló) and definite common nouns: human (ómóhé), animate (ófé) and inanimate (íkpún).32

ki construction subject phrases restrict some postdeterminers. SN animate subjects modified by the definite article combine with deictic demonstratives ná and áín
(kí ólí ómóhé ná / áín gbé' ófè ò [SN the man this that PAP.kill rat INT] ‘It surely isn't
the case that this / that man killed a rat’). Also acceptable is contrastive demonstrative nóí (kí ómóhé nóí gbé' ófè ò [SN man next PAP.kill rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the
case that the next man killed a rat’).
In SN subject position kindred forms are partially restricted. Deictic élìyó is
grammatical but contrastive sortal ódàn is not (kí úkpún élìyó / *ódàn ó ò ghàén ò
[SN cloth that.kind different.kind SC H costly INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that
kind of cloth is costly’).
SN subjects admit only one quantifier, collective universal èrèmé. It occurs, although not with the definite article (kí (*élí) éwé èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goats all
PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that all the goats entered the
house’). No other quantifier (distributive universal òdóòdé, partitive existential ósò
or contrastive existential óvbèé) occupies SN subject position as modifier.
Subject phrases in ki matrix clauses allow most numeral modifiers. One finds
collective ìgbìgbé ‘all ten’ (kí íkpún ìgbìgbé tóó' á vbí ólì èràìn ò? [SN cloths all.ten
PAP.burn CS LOC the fire INT] ‘Isn't it surely the case that all ten cloths burned up in

house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the man alone entered the house’).
ki subjects accept postnominal modifier phrases. Among the latter are expressions with Associative ísì (kí (ólí) éwé ísì ólí ókpósó ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goat ASS the

R he PAP.drink the wine PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It isn't the case that the man who
drank the wine killed the rat, although you may have thought so’). In elicited constructions, there is a preference for definite article inclusion.
Subject position in ki constructions imposes greater restrictions on impersonal
pronouns than personal pronouns. It allows subject pronouns for each person and
number.","[434, 435, 436]"

Complex predicates specify attainment of the extreme endpoint of a course of motion with V2 so in series. As V1, endpoint predications take a verb of motion, either
transitive (heen) or intransitive (shan, gbe, la). so identifies a motion subevent’s
quantitative end state as having telic status. Predication sense is ‘to the end, to the
top’ depending on axis of orientation.

Emai complex predicates assert the telic status of a change of existence state. V1
forms denote an incremental change of existence with an implied end state open to718 | Aspect expressing complex predicatestelic specification. Existence end states manifest a distinct perceptual character
when oriented on the vertical or horizontal axis by V2 re and its ‘rise’ or ‘arrive’
sense, respectively. In effect, re expresses a change in entity existence from absence
to presence.
With an intransitive verb, e.g. ze ‘grow,’ or a verb like filo ‘thrust’ as V1, re ‘rise’
predications assume incremental change of state on the vertical axis. They augment
intransitive subject or transitive direct object referent substance and assert perceptible emergence of the referent. In this respect, re predications represent the converse of predications with the postverbal Change of State (CS) a particle. While CS a
predications refer to dissolution of material substance (Chapter 9, 9.3.2.1), re predications refer to emergence of substance. Predications with CS a and re refer less to
change of material state (e.g. from intactness or wholeness toward dissolution) than
to change in entity existence. For re that would be from physically absent to physically present; however, for CS a it would be from physically present to physically
absent. Translation equivalents for re ‘rise’ predications engage English forms of
emergence: prepositions out, up or verbs sprout, arise.

On the horizontal axis with V2 re ‘arrive,’ existence end state has a deictic character. The deictic reference point is the speaker or a speaker defined position, from
which perspective a change of existence state from absence to presence has occurred. As V1, complex re ‘arrive’ predicates take transitive manipulation verbs or
transitive motion verbs (with attendant constraints on direct object shape).15 English
translation equivalents of predication sense rely on the verb bring or an additional
deictically centered clause of place.

sense is expressed by ‘out, up’ or a distinct verb of achievement (e.g. ‘sprout’).
(180) ólí ókà zé
ré'.
the maize PRP.grow rise
‘The maize has sprouted / grown out.’
Other simple V1 intransitives (hu ‘boil,’ san ‘become pellucid,’ ohia ‘grow’) express a
change of existence state whose end state is open to telic coding. However in re
predications existence end state is closed, i.e. achieved.

Complex predicates convey a change of positional posture state with intransitive V1
and V2 forms. In simple predicates, V2 forms express a state of posture for the human body. In corresponding complex predications, V2 signals end state of a positional change in posture. V1 and V2 vary in tandem. V1 expresses direction of change
(daa ‘raise,’ dee ‘lower’) and V2 the positional end state (muzan ‘stand,’ mehen ‘lie’).
Component verbs are not only paired but also strictly ordered. V2 muzan follows V1
daa, and V2 mehen follows V1 dee. Predication sense is ‘up’ or ‘down,’ respectively.

V1 occurs with NP1, but it does not occur exclusively as an intransitive verb. V1 daa
in simple transitive predications collocates with a body-part noun in direct object
position, e.g. éhòn ‘ear,’ to render English ‘listen.’ Similarly, V1 dee appears with the
verb re ‘arrive’ in series and, in the transitive, a body-part noun direct object. Both734 | Aspect expressing complex predicatestransitive and intransitive dee re show the sense ‘lower, bend down.’ Thus neither
V1 verb occurs as a simple intransitive predication.

Emai complex predicates convey contact end state or contact exclusion. Transitive
V1 forms express change of positional state for a direct object referent while leaving
the nature of contact end state unspecified. V2, followed by a locative vbi phrase and
its referent, specifies point of contact or its exclusion for direct object and locative
referents. English translation of complex contact predications engages collocations
involving locative relational verbs (e.g. hang, lean, tie, press, stick, pound) and locative prepositions of contact (e.g. against), support (e.g. on, against), attachment (e.g.
on), inclusion/penetration (e.g. in) or exclusion (e.g. from).

Complex predicates of supportive end state occur with V2 gon ‘be crooked, bent, off

In transitives, the NP2 direct object referent comes in contact with the vbi complement referent. As V1 in transitive predications, verbs of object manipulation (e.g. roo ‘pick out’ and nwu ‘take hold’) occur. Predication sense is
‘lean against.’Contact end state with locative | 743(275) a. òjè nwú

Complex predicates express a telic end state of existence with V2 re ‘arrive’ in series.18 As V1, there occur transitive verbs of object manipulation, which in simple
predications convey a change of existence state open to deictic specification. In
complex predications, end state value is closed by telic re. Predications of this nature assert that subject and direct object referents have arrived at the speaker or
some other deictic focal point, i.e. they have undergone a change of existence from
absence to presence. English translation is most often rendered by ‘bring.’

Complex predicates express a telic change of existence state with V2 re ‘arrive’ in
series with direction verb buu ‘approach.’19 As a simple predicate, buu expresses a
change of existence state open to telic specification. Simple buu takes as direct object accusative pronouns (e.g. óì, é) in addition to lexical nouns (e.g. òkpòsò).

Emai complex predicates expressing a change in positional state specify telic status
with multiple V1 forms. Until signaled as telic by V1, either positional change is
incremental and aligns with simple V2 transitive verbs or position is stative and
aligns with simple V2 intransitive posture verbs. Direction of change is a function of
V2 forms and their transitive and intransitive verb meaning. Translation relies on
directional prepositions up, down, around or end state positional expressions such
as at arm’s length or flat out.

Complex predicates articulate a telic change of positional state. As V2, the verbs
khuae ‘raise,’ gbe ‘fell, reposition downward,’ khakha ‘spread,’ and ruan ‘tie’ occur
in series, respectively, with the V1 object manipulation verbs nwu, fi, ku and re. In
simple predications, V2 expresses an incremental change of positional state whose
final end state is open or unspecified, i.e. atelic. Addition of V1 in complex predications closes or specifies the end state. Telic specification thus differentiates simple
from complex change of positional state predications.

Typically, complex transitive change of positional state predications assert a telic
positional change for the NP2 referent. Some complex predications, however, assert
telic change for the NP1 referent (òjè ‘Oje’).

Oje PRP.take wall
climb
‘Oje got to the top of the wall / climbed up to the wall top.’
b. òjè héén

Oje PRP.climb wall
‘Oje climbed the wall.’
Predications of telic positional change restrict direct object. Although a broad class
of nouns occur as direct object for V2 in simple predications, only a subset appear as
NP2 in complex predications, e.g. heen ùdékèn ‘climb the wall’ immediately above
corresponds to nwu ùdékèn heen but heen ólí óràn ‘climb the tree’ below does not
correspond to nwu ólí óràn heen.

the meaning ‘carry.’

V1 fi (òjè fí ólí óràn gbé ‘Oje felled the tree (down) flat out’) is more problematic.
Strict deconstruction fails. Although V2 gbe ‘reposition, fell’ as a transitive shape
accepts NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object, V1 fi disallows NP1 as subject and
NP2 as direct object. Neither appears as an intransitive shape with NP1 or NP2 as
subject.

13Although verb complement particles (Change of State a, Change of Location o, Applicative li/ni

except in the case of Temporal Perspective, which precedes or follows a Place adverb. Temporal
Perspective lee co-occurs with Frequency, Place and Deixis, but never with Manner, Mannerdemonstrative or Extent.
Temporal Perspective lee precedes but does not follow adverbs of Temporal Deixis (òdè) and
Frequency (èdèdé, ìsòkpá, édèédè).

Noncanonical constructions in Emai express the information status of a clause or
clause constituent in discourse. Discourse-defined constructions include positive
focus (PF) and negative focus (NF), topicalization, antitopic or right dislocation,
information questions, sentence affirmation (SA) and sentence negation (SN). Each
construction is morphosyntactically marked except topicalization, where intonation
downturn follows the topic constituent. Except for sentence affirmation and sentence negation, each construction is characterized by an additional constituent that
precedes or follows its matrix clause. The resulting discourse position, typically a
noun phrase, corresponds to a matrix clause grammatical relation. Each construction also co-occurs with at least one other construction type, although distinct constructions never affect the same matrix clause constituent.

Focus constructions assume a contrast between speaker and hearer knowledge
regarding the information status of a nominal referent or predicate event. Construc-348 | Noncanonical constructionstion purpose is to align hearer and speaker knowledge. Focus position in this construction expresses information that is not shared by speaker and hearer. Its following matrix clause conveys shared information.
Focus position is marked in affirmative structures by the morpheme li/ni and in
negative structures by ki. Focus position immediately precedes a matrix clause and
its constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in the matrix clause. For example, the focus position constituent ólí émà followed by li/ni or ki corresponds to
the direct object relation following the matrix verb shen. Focus position noun
phrases manifest an unmarked tone pattern, i.e. they accept a right edge low tone.
On the other hand, focus construction matrix clauses inflect for a limited range of
aspects, all with a right edge high tone subject.

‘It was the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
b. ólí émà kí ólí ómóhé ló
shèn ákhò.
the yam NF the man PRED sell tomorrow
‘It wasn't the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
Across affirmative and negative focus types, only positive focus allows omission of
the construction marker. When li/ni is omitted, vowel elision does not affect phonological shape of either focus noun phrase (ólí émà) or matrix clause initial constituent (ólí ómóhé).

‘It was the yam that the man sold.’7.1.1 Matrix clause marking of focus relation
Focus constructions show variable grammatical marking of the matrix clause position corresponding to a focus constituent. They also limit nominal structure types in
focus position. As well, they constrain marking of their matrix clause as to inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs.
Focus constructions mark the matrix grammatical relation corresponding to a
focus constitutent with one of three strategies. The first of these affects matrix subject, possessor or first object in a double object complement. Each shows a pronoun
corresponding to the focus position constituent. A positive or negative focus position noun phrase (ólí ómòhè) corresponds to a third person singular pronoun (o ‘he’)
in matrix subject position.","[369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374]"
"432 | Be, do, happen and haveAlthough SPE constructions with óò answer a wide range of information questions,5 they do not appear as information questions. Instead, an u form, found in
property copula and class membership copula constructions, shapes information
questions for which SPE constructions serve as responses. Information questions
with u accept interrogative pronouns for person (óé'), object (émé') and quantity
(éká) but not place (ébé').

naira four be
‘It’s four naira.’The entire SPE construction in complex topic-comment structures designates a
comment relative to a preceding topic constituent (e.g. ólí ómòhè). Although the SPE
construction follows a noun phrase in topic position, the topic noun phrase corresponds to no pronoun marked for a grammatical relation in the SPE construction, as
is the case in simple topic constructions.
(24) ólí ómòhè, òjè óò.
the man
chief be
‘As for the man, he’s the traditional ruler.’
SPE constructions also serve as comment for a morphosyntactically heavy topic that
is extraposed and marked by indicative complement khi. The entire topic comment
configuration shows only a polar interrogative mood.

The complementary copula forms vbi and u articulate class membership (CMB).
They assign a referent to a nominal class. Canonical CMB constructions define two
noun phrase positions: the assigned nominal precedes the class nominal with the
copula interposed. The overall syntactic shape of CMB constructions is constrained,
particularly with respect to noun phrase composition and copula verbal properties.","[457, 458]"
"Noncanonical construction co-occurrence | 4137.7 Noncanonical construction co-occurrence
Constructions reflecting sentence affirmation, sentence negation, positive focus,
negative focus, topic, right dislocation and information question types are constrained in their ability to co-occur. For constructions that relate a discourse defined
position to a corresponding grammatical relation, compatibility is possible only
with distinct grammatical relations. No two constructions are compatible when
affecting the same grammatical relation.
Sentence affirmation and sentence negation establish a baseline for assessing
construction compatibility. Of the two, sentence negation is more restricted. SA érí'
and SN ki are compatible, although érí' must precede ki (*kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé' ófè
[SN SA the man PAP.kill rat] ‘It is not the case, indeed, that the man killed a rat’).
(154) érí' kí ólí ómóhé gbé'
ófè.
SA SN the man PAP.kill rat
‘Indeed, it is not the case that the man killed a rat.’
Sentence affirmation is restricted with other constructions. It appears with topicalization and RD but never with positive focus, negative focus or direct questions. As
shown below, SA and topicalization are compatible, provided the matrix clause
shows relative tense Anterior ke (*ólí ómòhè, érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man SA he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the man, indeed he killed the rat’). Also below, SA érí' follows a topic noun phrase (*érí' ólí ómòhè, ó ké' gbé ólí ófè [SA the man he PAP.ANT
kill the rat] ‘Indeed, as for the man, he killed the rat afterward’).
(155) a. ólí ómòhè, érí' ó ké'

b. òjè, érí' á à ké nwù óí gbúdú.
Oje SA one H ANT take him squirming.fashion
‘As for Oje, indeed he was afterward taken squirming.’
Sentence affirmation and right dislocation are compatible. érí' precedes a matrix
clause whose subject or direct object relation corresponds to the RD constituent.
(156) a. érí' ó gbé'
ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè.
SA he PAP.kill rat ID be the man
‘Indeed he killed a rat, that is the man.’
b. érí' ólí ómóhé gbé'

SA the man PAP.kill it ID be the rat
‘Indeed the man killed it, that is the rat.’414 | Noncanonical constructionsWhen matrix verb takes both direct and indirect object, sentence affirmation and
right dislocation combine only when the direct object is right dislocated. érí' is unacceptable when subject or indirect object corresponds to the RD constituent.

ólí úkpùn ní áìn, í khì ólì òkpòsò.
SA Oje PAP.sell the cloth APP her ID be the woman
‘Indeed Oje sold the cloth to her, that is the woman.’
Sentence affirmation does not precede or follow positive focus li/ni (*érí' ólí ófè
lí ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [SA the rat PF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, it was the rat that the
man killed’, *ólí ómóhé lí érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man PF SA he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was
the man, indeed, who killed the rat’), negative focus ki (*érí' ólí ómóhé kí ó gbé' ólí

*ólí ófè kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [the rat NF SA the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It wasn’t the rat

[who SA he PAP.kill the rat] ‘Who indeed killed the rat?’, *érí' émé' ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì?
[SA what the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, what did the man kill?’).
Sentence negation co-occurs with only two construction types, although in neither does SN ki occur clause initially. As indicated previously, sentence negation cooccurs with sentence affirmation provided ki follows érí'. In addition, SN combines
with topicalization. It never combines with positive focus, negative focus, right
dislocation or information questions.
Sentence negation co-occurs with topicalization as shown immediately below,
provided the topic phrase precedes ki (*kì ólí ómòhè, ó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man he
PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case that as for the man, he killed the rat).
(158) ólí ómòhè, kí ó gbé'
ólí ófè ò.

SN he PAP.kill the rat INT
‘As for the man, it isn't the case that he killed the rat, you know.
Sentence negation fails to combine with positive focus li/ni (*kí ólí ómóhé nà lí ó
gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man this PF he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case
that it was this man who killed the rat’), negative focus ki (*kí ólí ómóhé nà kí ó gbé'
ólí ófè ò [SN the man this NF he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case that it
wasn’t this man who killed the rat’), right dislocation í khi (*kí ó gbé' ólí ófè, í khì ólíNoncanonical construction co-occurrence | 415ómòhè ò [SN he PAP.kill the rat ID be the man INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case that he
killed the rat, that is the man’) and information questions (*kí óé' ó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN
who he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case who killed the rat’).
The remaining construction types, all of which show a discourse defined position, exhibit varying degrees of compatibility. Information questions are the most
severely restricted.
Topic position combines with positive focus, negative focus and direct questions. It fails with right dislocation. No matter the other construction, the topic constituent appears in leftmost position (*ólí ómòhè lí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man PF the
rat he PAP.kill it] ‘It was the man, as for the rat, who killed it’). When topic and positive focus position co-occur, topic precedes the li/ni marked focus constituent.

b. ólí ómòhè, ólí ófè lí ó gbé'-ì.
the man
the rat PF it PAP.kill-F
‘As for the man, it was the rat he killed.’
A single constituent is never referenced in both topic and focus position (*ólí ófè,
íyòìn lí ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [the rat he PF the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for the rat, it was he
who the man killed’).
When topic and negative focus both occur, topic precedes the negative focus
noun phrase, never the reverse (*ólí ómòhè kí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man NF the rat he
PAP.kill it] ‘It wasn’t the man, as for the rat, who killed it’).
(160) ólí ófè, ólí ómòhè kí ó gbé'

ófè, íyòìn kí ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [the rat he NF the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for the rat, it
wasn’t he who the man killed’).
When topic and information question frames co-occur, topic precedes the question word (*ébé' ólí ómòhè, ó' yé? [where the man he PAP.move.to] ‘Where, as for the
man, did he move to?’, *émé' ólí ómòhè, ó ré' híán ólí óràn? [what the man he

híán ólí óràn?
the man
what he PAP.use cut the wood
‘As for the man, what did he use to cut the wood?’
When a topic constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in an embedded Scomplement of an information question, topic precedes interrogative pronoun
(*émé' ó zé-í' ólí ómòhè, khì ò híán ólí óràn? [what it PAP.cause-F the man IND he

khì ò híán
ólí óràn?
the man what it PAP.cause-F IND he PRP.cut the wood
‘As for the man, why did he cut the wood?’
Topic and right dislocation are incompatible, even when each position corresponds to a distinct grammatical relation in the matrix clause (*ólí ómòhè, ò shén óì,
í khì ólí úkpùn [the man he PRP.sell it ID be the cloth] ‘As for the man, he sold it, that
is the cloth’).
Positive focus shows extremely limited compatibility with other construction
types. It co-occurs with topic, as already indicated, and right dislocation but not
with negative focus and information questions.
Positive focus and right dislocation are compatible, although crossover of
grammatical relations constrains grammatical acceptability. When matrix grammatical subject corresponds to positive focus, matrix direct object in a monotransitive
complement can correspond to a right dislocated constituent. However, a direct
object in a monotransitive complement that corresponds to a focus position noun
phrase never co-occurs with a subject that corresponds to a constituent in RD position (*ólí úkpùn lí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the cloth PF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man]
‘It was the cloth that he sold, that is the man’, *ólí ófè lí ó gbé'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the

the man PF he PAP.kill it ID be the rat
‘It was the man who killed it, that is the rat.’
Positive focus never co-occurs with information questions. Even when distinct
grammatical relations are affected, focus and direct question are incompatibleNoncanonical construction co-occurrence | 417(*ébé' ólí ómòhè lí ó yé'-ì? [where the man PF he PAP.move.to-F] ‘To where was it
that it was the man who moved?’, *ólí ómòhè lí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man PF where he
PAP.move.to-F] ‘It was the man who to where did he move?’).
Negative focus also shows limited co-occurrence with other construction types.
It appears with topic, as already seen, and right dislocation, but not with positive
focus or direct questions. Negative focus and right dislocation are compatible, although crossover of grammatical relations in the matrix clause limits combinations.
Subject corresponds to a constituent in negative focus position when a direct object
corresponds to right dislocated position.

b. ólí ómòhè kí ó gbé'
óì, í khì ólí ófè.
the man NF he PAP.kill it ID be the rat
‘It was the man who killed it, that is the rat.’
But a direct object that corresponds to negative focus position never co-occurs with
a subject that corresponds to right dislocated position (*ólí úkpùn kí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí
ómòhè [the cloth NF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man] ‘It wasn’t the cloth that he sold,
that is the man’, *ólí ófè kí ó gbé'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the rat NF he PAP.kill-F ID be the
man] ‘It wasn’t the rat that he killed, that is the man’).
Negative focus never co-occurs with information questions. Even with distinct
grammatical relations affected, NF and questions are incompatible (*ébé' ólí ómòhè
kí ó yé'-ì? [where the man NF he PAP.move.to-F] ‘Where if it wasn’t the man did he
go to?’, *ólí ómòhè kí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man NF where he PAP.move.to-F] ‘It wasn’t
the man so where did he move to?’).
As indicated previously, right dislocation co-occurs with positive focus, negative focus and with information questions. It never combines with topicalization. RD
and information questions are compatible provided distinct matrix relations are
involved. Moreover, crossover of subject to right dislocated position and direct object to question position is acceptable.
(165) émé' ó shén'-ì,
í khì ólí ómòhè?
what he PAP.sell-F ID be the man
‘What did he sell, that is the man?’
In addition, the constraint limiting RD to subject or direct object does not apply
under a question condition. Indirect objects marked by Applicative li/ni appear in
RD position with question words corresponding to subject or direct object.","[438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443]"
"9 Postverbal particles in complex predicates
Emai verb phrases show complex predicates framed by postverbal particles in construction with verb forms. Each verb-particle predication type is associated with
multiple semantic functions. Nonetheless, each in its principal function signals
either Change of Possession (Applicative, APP) li/ni, Change of Location (CL) o,
Change of State (CS) a, Projected Change of Location with Adherence (PAD) e, or
Temporal Perspective (TEMP) lee.

Two Emai particles specify event aspect (CS and TEMP), while three characterize
argument structure. Particle co-occurrence relates to function. Temporal Perspective
lee combines with each of the other particles. Change of State, Change of Location
and Projected Adherence are mutually exclusive. Change of State and Change of
Location each combine with Applicative li/ni, although not when the latter marks
Change of Possession recipient. Instead, li/ni in these constructions with CS a and
CL o codes a benefactive semantic role.

with its preceding verb depending on structural conditions. Moreover, particles
exhibit tone behavior distinct from adverbials, since they fail to induce high tone
spread at right edge of a preceding direct object constituent. No postverbal particle
serves as a simple predicate.
In this chapter as well as Chapters 10, 11 and 12 addressing other complex predications, we detail a range of structural properties for each predication type. These
include component verbs and related noun phrases as well as restrictions concerning inflectional aspect, polarity and mood, possible repositioning of arguments to
discourse prominent positions and predication response to aspectually sensitive
question types. The latter take the shape of discourse frames incorporating
émé'/émí' NP ú ‘What did someone do?’ and émé'/émí' ú ‘What happened?’.1

Complex predicates coded by postverbal Applicative (APP) li/ni and its nominal
complement express recipient or beneficiary relations conveyed in English by
‘to/for’ or ‘from.’ Component verbs are transitive or intransitive.
Applicative form varies according to its complement. Its li exponent occurs with
a lexical noun complement. The ni form appears with a pronoun complement or
when the Applicative is stranded in postverbal position, as in positive focus (PF)
constructions marked by li/ni.

li/ni complements identify event beneficiary, an argument of the predication
that benefits in some way from an event (Blake 2001). Beneficiary functions occur
with simple predicates (hóó ‘wash) and complex predicates (nwú móé ‘hold’).","[542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547]"

Complex predicates consisting of Change of State (CS) particle a or Change of Location (CL) particle o and either of the verbs fi or ku in series express meanings bearing
on object release. They convey change of spatial location that is projected (PCL) orProjected and extended change | 559extended (ECL), change of positional state that is extended (ECPS), change of material state that is extended (ECMS), or state change that is extended (ES). In each, the
subject or direct object referent releases through space, ballistically propelled by
force (PCL) or nonballistically extends through space in a continuous motion (ECL),
extends across a continuous space of change of state (ECPS/ECMS), or extends
across a state (ES). These are summarized in Table 5.
Tab. 5: Sample meanings and co-occurrence relations between representative verb types and morphemes marking bounded (fi o / ku o) and unbounded (fi a / ku a) projected change of location
(PCL), extended change of location (ECL), extended change of positional state (ECPS), extended
change of material state (ECMS) and extended state (ES).fi afi oku aku oPCL vboo ‘jump’‘away’‘onto’‘away’‘ontoECL khu chase’‘away‘into’‘away’‘into’ECPS gbe ‘fell’‘all over’‘all over’ECMS gboo ‘break’‘entirely’ES khenkhen ‘be spoiled’‘entirely’Change nature in these predications is twofold. Either it is bounded by an overt
reference point, and thus marked by fi / ku o and a following locative vbi phrase. Or
it is unbounded, and thus not overtly expressed, in which case it is marked by fi / ku
a. Choice of fi or ku reflects grammatical number of affected argument, fi for singular
and ku for plural/mass. ku often reflects a distributive sense characterized in English
translation by ‘throughout, all over’ or verbs such as ‘splash.’
Bounded and unbounded change predications occur with a variety of verbs in
series, in particular those expressing change of location or change of state. These
verbs assume intransitive or transitive shapes where they tend not to accept either
CL o or CS a in the absence of fi or ku. Distribution facts reveal five patterns for complex transitive predications of projected and extended change.","[581, 582, 583, 584, 585]"

Verbs in assertive pattern three with CS a exhibit a sense shift. For instance, khuye

Complex predicates of affirmative pattern four constrain aspect but not transitivity.
CS a with transitive verb soo is obligatory in the perfect but optional in the imperfect. Verb lexical meaning asserts a change of state but not a maximal change. However, verb plus CS a in either perfect or imperfect entails a telic, maximal change.

With een, S-complements constrain cross-clause subject identity and subject correspondence to interrogative and substitutive pronouns. Subject identity across matrix and embedded clause varies by complement type. For indicatives, subject identity is optional, since subject takes either a logophoric (yon) or personal (o) pronoun.

A complex predicate consisting of verbs mama ‘plan’ and re ‘arrive’ takes li and khi
complement types. It appears with li S-complements obligatorily extraposed from
direct object position. Moreover, mama re accepts this complement only when either
Resultative auxiliary za occurs in the matrix clause or when mama re subject corresponds to a focus constitutent preceding li/ni. Under either condition, mama re
accepts subjunctive complements.

cross clause subject identity is not permitted, since complement subject position
takes personal (o) pronouns but not logophoric (yon) pronouns. And as the immediately preceding example suggests, khi complements with mama re disallow subject
identity across clauses.

Direct and indirect information questions consist of two constituents: question (or

correspond to a grammatical relation in the matrix clause.
Matrix clauses across direct and indirect questions limit aspect. They inflect for
Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective, each of which exhibits a
right edge high tone subject phrase. Question constructions reject Present perfect,
Continuous imperfect and Anticipative prospective, each of which manifests a right

Emai complex predicates identify the telic end state of a change of quantitative
state. Telicity is coded by semantically differentiated V2 forms se, gbe, khoon and so.
Each conveys, respectively, an end state that is sufficient, excessive, satisfactory or
maximal. The entire predication brings into perspective an incremental change of
quantitative state expressed by V1 and assigns to its end state a telic condition.","[728, 729, 730, 731, 732]"

Informative++++++Conversative+++++-Communicative+++++-Assumptive+-+++-Factuality+-----Perceptive+--+--Desiderative-+----++----KnowledgeEvaluation & Judgment
EvaluativeCo-occurrence constraints between verb and complement type tend to cluster
around verbs of like meaning. For Emai, there appear to be three verb clusters, each
grounded to differences in complement character, as Table 6 indicates. Although all814 | Embedded S- and VP-complementscomplements manifest informational content, this information is differentially interpreted vis-à-vis an event participant variously construed as addressee, affected
experiencer or controlling experiencer. One verb cluster (Speech & Communication)
treats complement content as a message conveyed between speaker and addressee,
not each of whom is syntactically expressed. A second cluster (Knowledge) views
complement content as a human memory state, e.g assumptive, factual, perceptive
or desiderative. And a third cluster (Evaluation & Judgment) considers complement
content for its psychological impact or stimulus effect on an expressed or assumed
affected experiencer.
As Table 6 suggests, complement types are not evenly distributed across the
three verb clusters. Speech and communication verbs accept nearly the full range of
complement types including direct quote, although differences exist according to
subtype. Knowledge verbs are more restricted particularly with respect to subjunctive li and, as might be expected, direct quote. And verbs expressing judgments
evaluating complement content are even more restricted, never taking conditional
si, indirect question, verb phrase or direct quote complements.
Corollary generalizations concern complement types themselves. That is, the
propensity for a complement type to attach to a given verb reflects a hierarchical
tendency imperfectly expressed in the following two schemas. However limited,
these hierarchies represent constraints on complement distribution relative to verbs.
DQ > [khi, li, si]IQ > khiEssentially, no verb takes direct quote without also taking all other complement
types, including subjunctive li and conditional si. The second hierarchy asserts that
no verb takes indirect question without also taking indicative khi.
Another generalization characterizes the combination of complement types
found with any given verb. Although some verbs take only an indicative khi, subjunctive li or conditional si complement (khi/li/si), other verbs take the combination
of indicative, subjunctive and conditional (khi, li, si). Verbs that take more than one
complement do so selectively. Verbs may take indicative khi and subjunctive li. But
no verbs exclusively take khi and si complements or li and si complements. Correlating complement type with semantic verb type provides an initial glimpse into additional properties of embedded complement constructions. Properties associated
with the pairing of semantic verb type and S-, IQ-, VP, and DQ-complement types
are outlined in the following sections.","[839, 840]"

Emai complex predicates confirm fulfillment of an implied intentional state, making
the intentional state explicit with V2. Source of the intentional state is V1. Intentionality is the apparent origin of the predication’s purposive semantic character. Fulfillment is verbally expressed by stative verbs of quality (e.g. fuan ‘clean’), nonstative verbs with stative implications (e.g. e ‘eat’) or predications of co-location (ku
gbe ‘position together’).

Complex predicates confirm fulfillment of an intentional state with a verb of qualitative change of state. V2 denotes an intentional state that is lexically implied but not
asserted by V1. Since V2 choice is lexically dependent on V1, V2 form varies, exhibiting a variety of meanings, although all are absolutive rather than gradient or scalar
(e.g. gba ‘be big’) in character.

That V1 implies but does not assert intentional state V2 is revealed by constructions
with contrastive conjunction (àmáà ‘and’). Simple predicate V1 (kpe) with its subject
and direct object precede conjunct àmáà, which precedes simple predicate V2 (fuan)
with its subject pronoun. This entire construction is grammatical. But under conditions where the implication of material change advanced by V1 is already confirmed,
e.g. by Change of State (CS) a particle, contrastive conjunction with àmáà fails.

Emai exhibits embedded sentence (S) complements and verb phrase (VP) complements. S-complements exhibit three types based on complementizer form: indicative (IND) khi, conditional (COND) si and subjunctive (SBJ) li. Broadly reflective of
types in Lyons (1977), each indicates a distinct commitment by speaker regarding
occurrence or potential occurrence of complement event: fully committed khi, conditionally committed si or noncommittal li. Occurring clause initially, each complementizer constrains its subject noun phrase as well as inflectional, auxiliary and
preverb phrases.

‘The woman wants the man to eat the food.’
Related to complement constructions are indirect questions (IQ). IQs, framed by
ébé'/ébí'…i or émé'/émí' for example (Chapter 7, 7.5), also restrict their subject
phrase as well as inflectional, auxiliary and preverb phrases.

as to syntactic and tonal shape.

S-complements, IQ-complements and VP-complements vary in their syntactic properties. S-complements headed by indicative khi and conditional si often pattern
alike, while subjunctive li and VP complements often show similar behavior. IQcomplements reveal structural patterns frequently distinct from other complements.
The variable resistance of complement type to grammatical categories reflects a
scale. Indicative khi exhibits the least resistance, with conditional si at nearly the
same level. VP complements show greater resistance along with subjunctive li. IQ
restricts grammatical categories at a level between the pair khi-si and li-VP.1
khi > si > IQ > li >VPEmai’s complement scale is illustrated by polarity and mood expression. Scomplements, IQ-complements and VP-complements show variable polarity and
mood. Sentences incorporating S-complement types, IQ-complements2 and VP complements assume a polar interrogative form uniformly. However, only VP complements assume imperative shape.

As indicated in the following sections, Emai complement types restrict inflectional, auxiliary and preverb categories (Chapter 3). Inflection includes aspect, auxiliary includes deontic and epistemic modality as well as relative tense. Preverb
categories are aspectualizer, temporal, subject attributive, quantitative, evaluative
and manner-demonstrative. Overall, khi and si complements limit fewer of these
grammatical categories. IQ complements are somewhat more restricted. The most
severe restrictions affect subjunctive li and VP complements. The latter two complement types reject inflection, all auxiliaries and most preverb categories, although
li complements show deontic Hortative í with pronouns.","[820, 821, 822, 823, 824, 825]"

Counterfactual condition constructions establish an event that is contrary to fact as
a condition for realizing a second event that has failed to transpire. Emai shows two
types of contrary-to-fact conditions: possible and impossible. The possible type
presents a counterfactual condition potentially reversible in the real world. The
impossible does not entertain reversibility. Subordinate clauses of both types are
framed by kha. Their linked matrix clauses show kha for possible conditions and
Predictive ló for impossible conditions.

Countrary-to-fact possible condition constructions restrict aspect, relative tense,

coreference. Subordinate and matrix clauses in possible condition counterfactuals
require aspect agreement. Both clauses inflect for Past perfect (right edge high tone

Complex predicates specify an ablative relation (Blake 2001) with V2 in series shoo
re/re and its locative vbi complement. shoo vbi re/vbi re marked referents express
location and distance from which an entity is removed. V1 consists of object manipulation verbs such as nwu ‘take’ that are compatible with extraction and removal of
a direct object participant. Predication sense is ‘remove from, away from, out of, off
of,’ depending on V2 form.
(152) a. òjè nwú

Oje PRP.take the bag exit LOC table arrive
‘Oje removed the bag away from the table.’
b. òjè nwú
ólì èkpà vbì ìtébù ré.
Oje PRP.take the bag LOC table arrive
‘Oje removed the bag from the table.’
Via its V2 form, ablative predications convey degree of distance moved by NP2 relative to NP3. When V2 position is assumed by shoo vbi re, distance removed is construed as distal relative to the proximal relation that obtains when V2 position is
held by vbi re. Ablative predications fail when re does not occur as part of V2.

Noun phrase positions in shoo vbi re predications are constrained. As vbi complement in ablative predications, NP3 accepts the nondeictic locative pronoun o but
not deictic locative pronouns (e.g. èàn, èvbò).

‘be located’ in series with V1 and re, not V1 and shoo re.

Complex predicates express contact as an attachment end state with V1 tu ‘spread’
and V2 baa ‘join, add to’ in series followed by a locative vbi phrase. These predicates
occur as transitive or intransitive shapes. The attachment relation affects transitive
direct object NP2 (or intransitive subject) and vbi complement. Predication sense is
‘adhere, stick to.’

Complex predicates with ze ‘include, penetrate’ as V2 followed by a locative vbi
phrase convey a contact end state of penetration and inclusion. As V1, transitive
verbs occur that encode change of positional state (khuye ‘close’) or contact with an
implied change of positional state (khaan ‘pound’). The NP2 referent penetrates or is
inclusive to the vbi complement referent. No intransitive shapes appear as V1 in ze
predications. Predication sense is ‘VERB in, into.’Contact end state with locative | 749(299) a. òjè khúyé

meanings. As a simple predicate, khaan has sense ‘pound’ in Continuous aspect.
(303) òjè ò ó khààn àgá.
Oje SC C pound chair
‘Oje is pounding the chair (pieces of the chair) together.’
When khaan appears in complex predicates with instrument verb re in series or with
Change of Location particle o, predication sense is ‘pound.’

‘Oje is pounding the chair together with nails / nails into the chair.’
b. òjè kháán

V1 khuye as a simple predicate has the synchronic sense ‘close,’ while khuye with

V2 ze does not appear with NP1 or NP2 as intransitive subject, even in construction
with a locative vbi phrase. Nor is it the case that V2 ze appears with NP1 as transitive
subject and NP2 as direct object.

indirectly related to inclusion ze.","[770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776]"

CS a and assertive pattern five verbs constrain aspect and transitivity. They require
perfect aspect in their transitive shape but reject CS a in imperfect aspect. Pattern
five verbs without CS a occur in imperfect aspect. Verbs in this pattern have a lexical
meaning that implies but does not entail a telic change of maximal extent. When
combined with CS a, the resulting complex predication entails a telic change.
For some verbs, CS a is available only in the transitive and only in the perfect.

Confirmative patterns affect verbs that assert a change of state but imply a telic end
state of maximal extent. CS a confirms end state actualization That CS a predications bear on implied and asserted meaning is shown by contrastive àmáà ‘but’
constructions. When perfect negation ì appears in àmáà’s second conjunct expressing an implied element of meaning, verbs without CS a in the first conjunct are
grammatical. However, verbs with CS a in the first conjunct are ungrammatical.

Complex CS a predicates of confirmative pattern two limit neither transitivity nor
aspect. With transitive hian ‘cut’ and direct object úì ‘rope,’ CS a is optional in perfect and imperfect aspect.8 For a transitive verb, lexical meaning implies but does
not entail a telic change of maximal extent. Verb plus CS a predications confirm the
implication of maximal extent in perfect and imperfect aspect.

Pattern three verbs denote a lexical meaning that implies but does not entail a telic
or maximal extent change of state. Verb plus CS a predications in the perfect, however, confirm actualization of a telic end state. CS a and confirmative pattern three
verbs constrain aspect and transitivity. In the perfect, they optionally take CS a, but
in the imperfect they reject CS a. Transitive guogho, for example, optionally takes CS
a in the perfect but not in the imperfect.

Complex predicates with intransitive change of state verbs in series with verb ku and

"Overview of temporal adverbials | 289Morphosyntactically simple temporal adverbs express day units: òdè ‘yesterday,’ éènà ‘today,’ and ákhò ‘tomorrow.’ All correspond to question frame éghè re,
although the day past form, i.e. ákhò ‘tomorrow,’ also shows an í yi question.
Morphosyntactically simple and complex adverbial forms, depending on day
unit, express subintervals semantically grounded to day units. Subinterval adverbs
grounded to moment of utterance refer to immediate present (ènyáà ‘just
now/present’) and immediate past (èghéènà ‘recently’) with morphosyntactically
simple and complex forms, respectively. The corresponding information question
for immediate present is framed by í yi, and for immediate past by éghè re.
Subinterval adverbs grounded to units for past day (ékhèdéà ‘day before yesterday’) and future day (òtíàkhó ‘day after tomorrow’) show complex forms whose
morphological make up remains opaque. Their corresponding information question
frame is éghè re.
Subinterval adverbs within past are morphosyntactically complex forms involving partial or complete reduplication: èdèdé ‘not long ago, a while ago,’ ìghéèghé
‘generations past, long time ago.’ Their corresponding information questions are
framed by éghè re and í yi, with the latter reserved for most distant past: ìghéèghé.
A distal future adverbial grounded to present day is phrasal: ùsúmú éènà ‘nine
days from today.’ Its corresponding information question is éghè re.
Simple deictic adverbs (éénà, ákhò, and òdè) combine with nominal and modifier forms to shape complex adverbial phrases. Day-partitive nominal expressions
combine with day unit forms to denote one of four day divisions: égbìà ‘morning,’
ódìànmì ‘afternoon,’ énwàà ‘evening’ and ásòn ‘night.’ Their corresponding information question frame is éghè re, although those related to òdè ‘yesterday’ also
accept í yi.

combine with day-partitives.

Only the morphosyntactically simple adverb for past day unit (i.e. òdè) accepts the
temporal predeterminer in its basic or emphatic form. Day-unit forms for present
(*élá éènà / *élélá éènà ‘the today we talked about’) and future (*élá ákhò / *élélá
ákhò ‘the tomorrow we discussed’) do not. Temporal adverbs modified by the temporal predeterminer only correspond to information questions framed by í yi ‘which

élá òdè ‘the yesterday we discussed’élélá òdè ‘the yesterday we talked about’The subinterval day unit within past also accepts the emphatic temporal
predeterminer. Subinterval expressions within present and future domains,
however, reject the temporal predeterminer in its basic form (*élá ùsúmú éènà ‘the
fortnight from today we discussed’) or emphatic form (*élélá òtíàkhó ‘the day after
tomorrow we discussed’).
élá ékhèdéà ‘the day before yesterday we discussed’

Day-partitive units by themselves accept either the basic or emphatic temporal
predeterminer.

"356 | Noncanonical constructions7.1.3 Matrix clause properties
Focus constructions constrain expression of mood and polarity as well as inflection,
auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding mood, focus constructions never appear as
imperatives or prohibitives. Relative to polarity, both affirmative and negative focus
constructions appear as polar questions (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì? [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.sell-F] ‘Was / Wasn’t it the yam that the man sold?’).
In their matrix clauses, affirmative focus constructions allow perfect negation
marked by ì. Negative focus constructions disallow it (ólí émá nà òkpá lí / *kí ólí
ómóhé í ì shèn [the yam this alone PF NF the man SC NEG sell] ‘It was this yam alone
which the man did not sell’).
Matrix clauses in focus constructions limit inflection and auxiliaries. Relative to
aspect, they inflect for Past perfect, imperfect Habitual or prospective Predictive.6
All show a subject phrase with a high tone right edge. Matrix clauses in focus constructions reject Present perfect, imperfect Continuous or prospective Anticipative.

c. ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ló

the yam PF NF the man PRED sell
‘It is / isn't this yam that the man will sell.’
Focus construction matrix clauses limit deontic and epistemic modality as well
as relative tense. Of the modality forms, deontic Hortative í is never grammatical in
focus constructions. Epistemic forms are not as restricted, even if distributionally
sensitive to focus polarity. Appearing only in negative focus is Certaintive ma (ólí
émà kí / *lí ólí ómóhé má' shèn [the yam NF PF the man PAP.CER sell] ‘It wasn't the
yam that the man surely sold’), while Dubitatives only occur in positive focus polar
interrogative constructions, e.g. bia (ólí émà lí / *kí ólí ómóhé bíá' shèn? [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.DUB sell] ‘Was it the yam that the man actually sold?’) and vba (ólí
émà lí / *kí ólí ómóhé vbá' shèn? [the yam PF NF the man PAP.DUB sell] ‘Was it the
yam that the man really could have sold?’).
Some epistemic forms occur in affirmative and negative focus constructions:
Concessive rere (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ré'rè shén? [the yam PF NF the man
PAP.CONC sell] ‘Was / Wasn't it the yam that the man even sold?’) and Hypothetical
kha (ólí émá nà lí / kí ólí ómóhé khà shén [the yam this PF NF the man PAP.HYP sell]
‘It was / wasn't this yam that the man would have sold’). Concessive, though, re-Noun phrase focus | 357quires a polar interrogative structure. Remaining epistemic forms reflecting rational
judgments, Deductive za and Resultative za, fail in focus constructions.
Relative tense exponents appear in focus matrix clauses: Anterior ke (ólí émà lí /
kí ólí ómóhé ké' shèn [the yam PF NF the man PAP.ANT sell] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam
that the man sold afterward’) and Subsequent kpe (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé kpé' shèn
[the yam PF NF the man PAP.SUB sell] ‘It was /wasn’t the yam that the man sold
despite pending conditions’).
Focus construction matrix clauses severely limit preverb occurrence. For preverbs that occur, there is a tendency to require a nondeclarative, polar interrogative
structure in negative focus constructions.
As a class, aspectualizers interact with focus construction mood and polarity.
Matrix clauses linked to a positive focus position allow aspectualizers Repetitive che
(ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé ché' shèn [the yam PF the man PAP.REP sell] ‘It was the yam
that the man sold again’), Additive gbo (émà lí ólí ómóhé gbó' è [yam PF the man
PAP.ADD eat] ‘It was yam that the man ate too’) and Durative se (émà òkpá lí ólí
ómóhé sé' shèn [yam alone PF the man PAP.DUR sell] ‘It was one yam that the man
still sold’). They reject Punctual ghe, regardless of polarity or mood.
Negative focus matrix clauses accept all phasal aspectualizers but Punctual ghe.
They do so provided the construction assumes a polar interrogative form: che (ólí
émà kí ólí ómóhé ché' shèn? [the yam NF the man PAP.REP sell] ‘Wasn't it the yam
that the man sold again?’), gbo (émà kí ólí ómóhé gbó' è? [yam NF the man PAP.ADD
eat] ‘Wasn't it yam that the man also ate?’) and se (émà òkpá kí ólí ómóhé sé' shèn?
[yam alone NF the man PAP.DUR sell] ‘Wasn't it one yam that the man still sold?’).
Boundary aspectualizers manifest three distribution patterns. Irrespective of
construction polarity or mood, one finds Conative òó (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ó ó'
shèn [the yam PF NF the man SC CON sell] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam that the man
went to sell’).
Neither Ingressive ya nor Egressive mo occurs in focus matrix clauses. However,
their Past Absolute functions are available in positive focus: ya (ìmátó nà lí ólí
ómóhé yà dé élá úkpè [car this PF the man PAP.PA buy TP year] ‘It was this car that
the man used to buy in the year we discussed’) and mo (émá mè lí ólí ómóhé mó'
shèn [yam my PF the man PAP.PA sell] ‘It was my yam that the man at one time
sold’). With negative focus, Past Absolutes require a polar interrogative frame: ya
(ìmátó nà kí ólí ómóhé yà dé élá úkpè? [car this NF the man PAP.PA buy TP year]
‘Wasn't it this car that the man used to buy in the year we discussed?’) and mo (émá
mè kí ólí ómóhé mó' shèn? [yam my NF the man PAP.PA sell] ‘Wasn't it my yam that
the man at one time sold?’).
Of the temporal preverbs (kpao ‘initially,’ bobo ‘promptly,’ tua ‘hurriedly’), only
kpao appears in focus matrix clauses (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé kpá'ò shén [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.earlier sell] ‘It was / wasn't the yam that the man earlier on sold’).","[381, 382, 383]"

The Specifier copula (SPE) construction identifies a referent for a hearer. It exhibits
a rather rigid syntax. SPE constructions consist of Specifier copula o preceded by a
noun phrase in a focus position that is either overtly marked by negative focus ki or
covertly marked for positive focus. SPE rejects overt marking of positive focus by
li/ni. In its canonical shape, the Specifier copula shows a high low tone.

[the man I you be] ‘I am / you are the man’).
SPE frames exhibit few grammatical properties typically associated with verb
constructions. óò does not inflect for aspect, at least in the usual Emai fashion. Although the bare SPE copula shows high low tone, it disallows aspect marking as
perfect (neither Past nor Present), imperfect (neither Continuous nor Habitual) or
prospective (neither Predictive nor Anticipative).
Constructions with óò restrict verbal affixes, auxiliaries, preverbs, postverbal
particles and temporal deictic adverbs. Relative to verbal affixes, SPE is incompatible with Perseverative prefix Ci-, Distributive suffix lo/lo/no and Factative suffix -i.
SPE copula tone is uniformly low when preceded by a modal auxiliary. And SPE
is never compatible with a subject pronoun (ó ) preceding an auxiliary.
(18) íkhúnmí ékpà má ò.
medicine vomit CER be
‘It is vomit medicine.’/*íkhúnmí ékpà ó má' ò.
medicine vomit it CER beSPE constructions restrict auxiliaries, except for epistemic forms, and preverbs.
Relative tense ke and kpe are unacceptable as is deontic Hortative í. SPE allows
epistemic Certaintive ma, as shown above, Dubitative vba (óì vbá ò? [thief DUB be]
‘Could it really be a thief?’) and bia (íkhúnmí ékpà bíá ò? [medicine vomit DUB be]
‘Was it actually vomit medicine?’), and Concessive rere (óì rérè ó? [thief CONC be]
‘So it was even a thief?’). Of these, only Certaintive does not require a polar question. SPE disallows Deductive za, Resultative za and Hypothetical kha.
Specifier copula constructions limit preverbs absolutely. They reject aspectualizer gbo, evaluative kuku, temporal kpao and manner-demonstrative ìyó as representatives of their category (*óì gbó / kúkù / kpáò / ìyó ò [thief ADD POEV initially
DMD be] ‘It’s also / after all / firstly / so a thief’). In addition, they reject subject
attributive and quantity preverbs
SPE similarly constrains post-verbal complement particles and adverbials. It
disallows Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*óì óò léé / gbé [thief
be TEMP much] ‘He’s already too much a thief’). It also prohibits temporal deictic
adverbs such as éénà ‘today’ (*óì óò éènà [thief be today] ‘It’s a thief today’).
SPE óò constructions severely limit polarity and mood. They show an interrogative form with high high tone on the copula (óì óó? [thief be] ‘Is it a thief?’, óì kí óó?
[thief NF be] ‘Isn't it a thief?’). However, óò constructions do not assume an imperative, prohibitive or negative statement shape.
Specifier óò partially restricts its initial noun phrase position, i.e focus, as to NP
type, animacy and definiteness.4 For NP type, Specifier focus requires an emphatic
pronoun, irrespective of person or number. It rejects nonemphatic nominative pronouns (i, u) or the indefinite subject pronoun (a).","[454, 455, 456]"
"6.6 Ideophonic adverbs
Ideophonic adverbs articulate meanings that reflect speaker perspective. They need
not express a meaning shared by speaker and hearer and as such are not open to
interrogation by a hearer. Like other adverbs, they occupy postverbal position and
induce high tone spread in an immediately preceding noun phrase constituent.
Ideophonic adverbs assume a variety of morphological shapes and often express meanings typically lexicalized in English verbs. Some exhibit reduplication or
triplication.

ghóíghóí ‘glisteningly’
púpúpú ‘flappingly’
kpíkpíkpí ‘flutteringly’dúdúdú
‘very dark’

kpékpékpé ‘shiveringly’

píí ‘flingingly’
váí ‘snatchingly’
bóí ‘poppingly’
yóò ‘whoosh’wóò ‘smackingly’
gbìó ‘crackingly’
yáá ‘simmeringly’
húú ‘pungently’Ideophonic adverbs co-occur with a single verb or a few verbs of similar sense.
While they seem closely related to clause assertion, ideophonic adverbs do not fall
within the scope of assertion as judged by émé'…u ‘what happen,’ émé'…ruan ‘what
happen,’ and émé'…u ‘what do’ questions. Responses to these question types that
include an ideophonic adverb (e.g. pèú, gábé, bóbóbó) are unacceptable.

‘Oje scampered off.’Some ideophonic adverbs appear to heighten an event’s intensity level vis-à-vis
its predicate. The verb si, for instance, has the sense ‘draw, pull,’ whereas the collocation of si and the ideophonic adverb gúómí ‘with a jerk’ conveys a meaning equivalent to the English verb ‘jerk, cause a sudden jerky movement.’ Likewise, the collocation of verb khaan ‘pound’ and ideophone gùán ‘with a poke’ specifies English
verb ‘poke.’ khaan alone does not express ‘poke’; instead, it conveys ‘pound.’

With similar effect, other ideophonic adverbs (e.g. kútúkútú, tòbótòbó, yéyéyé) express meanings encapsulated by the English verbs ‘seethe,’ ‘glitter’ and ‘quiver.’338 | Adverbial adjunctsThese adverbs combine with verbs (tin, jin, guo) that alone convey the related senses
‘boil,’ ‘shine’ and ‘shake,’ respectively.

A subclass of postverbal adverbs consists of forms whose base morpheme corresponds to a synchronic verb. Deverbalized adverbs exhibit severe syntactic limitations. Among these forms are reduplicated rùrùrúrú and bìbìbíbí. Each corresponds,
respectively, to extant verbs ruru ‘be foolish’ and bibi ‘move in zigzag fashion.’

Deverbal adverbs correspond to direct questions framed by manner ébé'/ébí' …i
‘how’ or extent ébé'/ébí'…i…se ‘to what extent.’ Responses show adverbs in situ, not
as simple adverb phrases.","[362, 363, 364, 365]"
"2.6.1 Stem reduplication
Stem reduplication exhibits five structural classes. It affects noun, adverbial noun,
pronoun and postdeterminer combinations. The classes vary in their effacement of84 | MorphologyNS-1 final vowel or the portion of NS-2 reduplicated. The resulting reduplicated
forms within the five classes serve primarily as functional rather than lexical items.
For one class of reduplicated forms, the entire stem is repeated. The final vowel
or its tone in NS-1 is thus retained. Members denote relational nouns, temporal adverbials, property nouns, abstract nouns and an item in nature. For some, the semantic effect of reduplication maintains the stem referent while maximally extending a key dimension of referent meaning. For others, reduplication generates a
distinct referent. In one case, the stem referent cannot be synchronically identified.
Relational Noun:
óvbíóvbì ‘grandchild’: óvbì ‘offspring of’
égbéègbé ‘very edge of’: égbè ‘side of’
Temporal Adverbial:
éghèéghè ‘all the time, always’: éghè ‘time’
édèédè ‘daily, everyday’: édè ‘day’
èjéèjé ‘quickly, hastily’: èjé ‘quickly’
Property Noun:
ògbónògbón ‘extremely raw’: ògbòn ‘fresh, new’
Abstract Noun:
áèènáèén ‘social intrigues’: áèèn ‘symbol’
àtáàtà ‘truly, sincerely’: àtà ‘truth’
Bird:
ógbé'nógbé'n ‘crested helmet shrike’: ógbé'n (unknown)
A second class of reduplicated forms shows only partial reduplication. The final
vowel of NS-1 is replaced by a copy of the initial vowel of NS-2, the two showing a
high low tone sequence. Members of this class serve as relational nouns, property
nouns, temporal adverbials and postdeterminers. Since lexemes in this class derive
from noun stems that perform similar syntactic functions, the semantic effect of
reduplication is primarily emphatic.
Relational Noun:
éhéèhón ‘extreme edge of’: éhòn ‘ear, edge’
ágbáàgbán ‘very edge of’: àgbàn ‘chin, edge’
ógbòógbàn ‘absolutely diagonal to’: ógbàn ‘at a diagonal’
ékéèkéín ‘extreme bottom’: ékéìn ‘belly, middle of’
égéègén ‘base of, beneath’: ègèìn ‘crotch, underside’
ògùóògúé ‘systematicity’: ògùè ‘skill’
Property Noun:
òhóòhán ‘wrong, incorrect way’: òhàn ‘wrong way’
èkéèkén ‘sandy’: èkèn ‘sand’Reduplication | 85èréèréé ‘bloody’: èrèè ‘blood’
Temporal Adverbial:
ènyéènyáà ‘just now, right now’: ènyáà ‘just now’
ásàásòn ‘every night, nightly’: ásòn ‘night’
úkpùúkpè ‘every year, yearly’: úkpè ‘year’
Postdeterminer:
ódòódàn ‘very different kind’: ódàn ‘different kind of singleton’
édèédàn ‘very different kind of’: édàn ‘different kind of plurality’
èvéèvá ‘two-two each’: èvá ‘two’ (and other cardinal numerals)
Reduplicated forms of a third class show effacement of NS-1 final vowel and its
tone. Lexemes in this class denote kin terms, relational nouns, temporal adverbials
as well as pre- and post-determiners. Since members derive from noun stems performing similar functions, the semantic effect of reduplication denotes an emphatic
quality or a related but distinct referent.
Kin Term:
ínyìnyò ‘maternal grandmother’: ìnyò ‘mother’
érèrà ‘paternal grandfather’: èrà ‘father’
Relational Noun:
ésèsé ‘midst, exact middle’: ésè ‘center’
ìdàmìdámí ‘distant horizon’: ídámà ‘middle’
Temporal Adverbial:
èdèdé ‘moments ago, earlier’: édè ‘day’
ìsòkpísòkpá ‘immediately, at once’: ìsòkpá ‘once’
Predeterminer / Postdeterminer:
élèlà ‘the time unit we discussed’: élà ‘the time unit we discussed’
èvèvá ‘all two, both’: èvá ‘two’ (other cardinal numerals as well)
ìgbìgbé ‘all ten’: ìgbé ‘ten’
A fourth class of reduplicated forms reveals a distinct pattern of vowel effacement. The initial vowel of NS-2 is omitted. Members of this class derive from pronouns for proximal deictic demonstrative relations and result in pronouns. The
semantic effect of reduplication casts an emphatic quality.
Demonstrative Pronoun:
ónánà ‘this very one’: ònà ‘this one’
énánà ‘these very ones’: ènà ‘these ones’
Reduplicated forms in class five manifest still another pattern of effacement.
The final consonant and vowel (CV) of NS-1 elide. Members of this class are the par-86 | Morphologytitive existential pronoun and a lexical noun of Emai’s socio-cultural vocabulary.
The semantic effect of reduplication is emphatic for the pronoun; for the social role
term, it is relative diminution in status.
Pronoun:
óósò ‘someone’: ósò ‘certain one, some one’
Social Role:
òòbà ‘crown prince’: óbá' ‘Oba’2.6.2 Root reduplication and nominalization
Reduplication of verb roots occurs in the nominalization of verbs from nouns. A
stem is formed by reduplicating a verb root and adjoining it to a vowel prefix. Vowel
prefix types link with reduplicated roots in no obvious pattern, although half open
vowels [o] and [e] fail to appear in these reduplicated forms. For some lexemes, the
root is still synchronically available; for others, it remains opaque. Members of this
class denote physical entities, insects as well as social and climatic conditions.
Physical Entity:
ágbúlúgbùlù ‘cart, vehicle’: gbulu ‘to roll’
ígbúlúgbùlù ‘toys of tin or wood’: gbulu ‘to roll’
íkhùìkhúí ‘yam and plantain mash’: khui (khuikhui ‘to crumble’)
Insect:
ìkhúkhù ‘tiny black insect’: khu ‘to chase’
Social Condition:
ìfùnòfúnó ‘unsteadiness, instability’: funo a ‘to extinguish, flicker’
ìtàlòtáló ‘trash talk’: ta-lo ‘to speak repeatedly’
Climatic Condition:
òkhùàkhùà ‘harmattan wind’: khua (khuakhua ‘to be stiff’)
For another class of lexemes, the verb root undergoing reduplication is often
not synchronically available. Lexeme referents denote food, fish, domestic animals,
celestial bodies, landscape, illness, property and flora of the natural environment.
Since there are no synchronic noun stem forms related to these reduplication lexemes, there is no basis for expecting these forms to involve noun stem reduplication. Wherever possible we have thus posited potential verb roots.

Emai exhibits lexical items that reflect contact with various ethnic groups and their
languages in the relatively recent past. As well, some of these lexemes might reflect
a common historical past. For the moment, we do not pursue this historical matter.
Borrowed lexemes derive from English, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo, among other languages. Most borrowed forms are nouns for concrete or highly abstract objects.
Verbs tend not to be borrowed.
Lexemes that appear borrowed from English denote artifacts, food, locations
and abstractions. Many refer to referents from an English colonial era that persisted
from the 1890s to the 1960s.

Numeral expressions encapsulate within a single semantic domain the range of
Emai morphological types. Analytic compounds, synthetic compounds, derivation
and reduplication are found, as are monomorphemic stem forms. Progressive arithmetic processes of addition and multiplication underlie these lexeme types.
Numbers less than forty are expressed by a root or an analytic compound reflecting addition. Beyond twenty, multiples of twenty are expressed by multiplication, whereas non-multiples of twenty that are still multiples of ten are expressed by
multiplication and addition.
The cardinal numerals for 1-10 are expressed by monomorphemic roots.
òkpá ‘one’
èéà ‘three’
ìíhìèn ‘five’
ìhíón ‘seven’
ìsín ‘nine’èvá ‘two’
èélè ‘four’
èéhàn ‘six’
èén ‘eight’
ìgbé ‘ten’90 | MorphologyNumeral expressions for 11-19 are framed as analytic compounds. Each consists of
the stem ìgbé ‘ten’ followed by a stem selected from 1-9. These analytic compounds
consistently reflect an arithmetic process of addition: ìgbéèvà ‘twelve’ <ìgbé ‘ten’ +
èvà ‘two’>. The only exception is eleven (ìgbóó ‘eleven’ <ìgbé ‘ten’ + óó unknown but
possibly, ‘one’>), whose composition is synchronically opaque.
ìgbóó ‘eleven’
ìgbèéà ‘thirteen’
ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifteen’
ìgbìhíón ‘seventeen’
ìgbìsín ‘nineteen’ìgbéèvà ‘twelve’
ìgbèélè ‘fourteen’
ìgbèéhàn ‘sixteen’
ìgbèén ‘eighteen’Numeral expressions between twenty and forty show a different pattern. Multiples of 10 at 20 and 30 consist of monomorphemic stems.
ùúè ‘twenty’ógbàn ‘thirty’Numeral expressions in the twenties and thirties are framed as syntactic phrases
with Comitative conjunct bíì. The phrases consist of ùúè ‘twenty’ or ógbàn ‘thirty’
followed by bíì and a cardinal numeral root less than 10. Lexemes of this type reflect
an addition process.
ùúè bíì ìíhìèn ‘twenty-five’: ùúè ‘twenty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ùúè bíì òkpá ‘twenty-one’: ùúè ‘twenty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ùúè bíì ìsín ‘twenty-nine’: ùúè ‘twenty,’ bíì, ìsín ‘nine’
ógbàn bíì ìíhìèn ‘thirty-five’: ógbàn ‘thirty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ógbàn bíì òkpá ‘thirty-one’: ógbàn ‘thirty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ógbàn bíì ìsín ‘thirty-nine’: ógbàn ‘thirty,’ bíì, ìsín ‘nine’
Between 40 and 100, multiples of 10 reflect two patterns anchored to whether
they are also multiples of 20. Those with the values 40, 60, 80, 100, 200 and 1600,
for example, are formed by morphological derivation. They are framed by prefix
ègbòò- ‘twenty, score’; it attaches to cardinal root forms. The resulting derivations
reflect a process of multiplication.
ègbòèvá ‘forty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èvá ‘two’
ègbòèéà ‘sixty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èéà ‘three’
ègbòèélè ‘eighty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èélè ‘four’
ègbòìíhìèn ‘one hundred’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ ìíhìèn ‘five’
égbèén ‘one hundred sixty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èén ‘eight’
ègbòìgbé ‘two hundred’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ ìgbé ‘ten’Numeral lexemes and phrases | 91Bimorphemic derived forms act as a base for constructing syntactic phrases 41-49,
61-69, 81-89, 101-109, for example, each framed by Comitative bíì. The resulting
phrases consist of a multiple of 20 followed by bíì and a cardinal stem from 1-9.
ègbòèvá bíì òkpá ‘forty-one’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ègbòèvá bíì ìíhìèn ‘forty-five’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ègbòèéà bíì òkpá ‘sixty-one’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ègbòèéà bíì ìíhìèn ‘sixty-five’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ègbòèélè bíì òkpá ‘eighty-one’: ègbòèélè ‘eighty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ègbòèélè bíì ìíhìèn ‘eighty-five’: ègbòèélè ‘eighty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ègbòìíhèn bíì òkpá ‘one hundred one’: ègbòìíhìèn‘hundred,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ègbòìíhèn bíì ìíhìèn ‘one hundred five’: ègbòìíhìèn ‘hundred,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
Multiples of 10 that are not multiples of 20, i.e. the values 50, 70 and 90, are
framed as syntactic phrases grounded to morphologically derived lexemes. They
consist of the immediately preceding multiple of 20, expressed in its bimorphemic
affixal form, followed by Comitative bíì and the noun for cardinal 10. Multiplication
and addition underlie these numeral expressions.
ègbòèvá bíì ìgbé ‘fifty’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìgbé ‘ten’
ègbòèéà bíì ìgbé ‘seventy’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, ìgbé ‘ten’
ègbòèélè bíì ìgbé ‘ninety’: ègbòèélè ‘eighty,’ bíì, ìgbé ‘ten’
There are two morphosyntactic strategies for expressing numbers expanding each of
the above values to cover 51-59, 71-79, and 91-99. In one, multiples of 20 frame complex syntactic phrases involving a single instance of the Comitative conjunct. Resulting numerals consist of a multiple of 20, bíì and a cardinal stem from 11-19.
ègbòèvá bíì ìgbóó ‘fifty-one’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìgbóó ‘eleven’
ègbòèvá bíì ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifty-five’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifteen’
ègbòèéà bíì igbóó ‘seventy-one’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, ìgbóó ‘eleven’

Locative ‘be’ (LCT) constructions assign a nominal referent to a location. They are
framed by the complementary predicates ri and e. Each is followed by a prepositional phrase headed by vbi: NP ri vbi NP, NP e vbi NP. Concerning their distribution, ri‘be’ forms | 443appears under realis conditions, e.g. affirmative declarative in the perfect, and e
under irrealis conditions, e.g. imperfect and prospective aspect, negation and deontic modality.
LCT with ri and e differ in polarity and mood potential. e but not ri accepts Perfect Negation. Neither construction displays an imperative or prohibitive shape.

LCT frames appear as polar interrogatives when realis/irrealis conditions are met.

the woman PRP.be LOC house
‘Is the woman in the house?’
b. ólì òkpòsò í ì
è vbí ìwè?
the woman SC NEG be LOC house
‘Isn't the woman in the house?’
LCT constructions with ri and e show complementary inflection, auxiliaries and
preverbs. Aspect is expressed tonally in an irregular fashion. For Past perfect, ri
shows low tone and right edge high tone subject. For Present perfect, ri shows high
low tone and right edge low tone subject. Under conditions typical for Past and
Present perfect, ri would have shown, respectively, downstepped high (rí') and a
simple high (rí) tone (*ólí ókpósó rí' / ólì òkpòsò rí vbì èkìn [the woman be / the woman be LOC market] ‘The woman was in the market’).

accepts prospective Anticipative.

LCT constructions selectively express deontic and epistemic modality. e accepts
deontic Hortative (ólì òkpòsò í è vbì ìwè [the woman HOR be LOC house] ‘The woman
should be in the house’) and epistemic Hypothetical kha (ólí ókpósó khà é vbì ìwè
[the woman PAP.HYP be LOC house] ‘The woman would have been in the house’). ri
accepts neither.
Locative ri accepts Dubitatives vba (ólí ókpósó vbá' rì vbí ìwè? [the woman

and Certaintive ma (ólí ókpósó má' rì vbí ìwè [the woman PAP.CER be LOC house]
‘The woman surely was in the house’). Neither LCT predicate permits Concessive
rere or Resultative za.
LCT predications restrict relative tense. ri admits Subsequent kpe (ólì òkpòsò kpé
rì / *é vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.SUB be be LOC house] ‘The woman was yet in the

LCT imposes strong restrictions on preverbs. ri allows aspectualizers Durative se
(ólì òkpòsò séè rì vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.DUR be LOC house] ‘The woman continues to be in the house’) and Past Absolute mo (ólí ókpósó mó' rì vbí ìwè [the woman
PAP.PA be LOC house] ‘The woman at one time was in the house’).
e permits Past Absolute ya but only in polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó yà é vbí
íwé élá ódíánmì? [the woman PAP.PA be LOC house past afternoon] ‘Did the woman
used to be at home in the afternoons?’). No other aspectualizers are acceptable with
either LCT verb.
LCT constructions reject all remaining preverb classes: evaluative (e.g. kuku),
temporal (e.g. kpao), subject attributive (e.g. dégbe), manner-demonstrative (e.g.
ìyó) and quantity (e.g. dobo óì), as shown in *ólì òkpòsò kúkù / kpáò / dégbè / íyó' /
dóbó óì rì vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.POEV initially steadily DMD REFL her be LOC
house] ‘The woman after all / initially / steadily / that way / by herself is in the
house’.
In LCT constructions verb affixes, postverbal temporal particles and temporal
adjuncts are restricted. Relative to postverbal particles, ri with high low tone admits
Temporal Perspective lee but disallows Temporal Degree gbe (ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí‘be’ forms | 445ékín lèé / *gbè [the youth PRP.be LOC market TEMP much] ‘The youth is already in
the market’). Neither particle appears with e.
Each LCT form allows temporal adjuncts consistent with its realis/irrealis character. ri with high low tone accepts ènyáà ‘just now’ (ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí ékín ènyáà
[the youth PRP.be LOC market just.now] ‘The youth is in the market right now’),
which otherwise occurs with Continuous and Anticipative, and e allows éènà ‘today’
(ólí óvbékhán ló è vbí ékín éènà [the youth PRED be LOC market today] ‘The youth
will be in the market today’) and ákhò ‘tomorrow’ (ólí óvbékhán ló è vbí ékín ákhò
[the youth PRED be LOC market tomorrow] ‘The youth will be in the market tomorrow’). Neither LCT predicate allows any other deictic adjunct, in particular òdè ‘yesterday’ (*ólí óvbékhán rì vbí ékín òdè [the youth PAP.be LOC market yesterday] ‘The
youth was in the market yesterday’) and èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí ékín
èghéènà [the youth PRP.be LOC market recently] ‘The youth was in the market recently’).
Neither ri nor e combines with any verb affix, e.g. Perseverative Ci-, Factative -i,
or Distributive -lo/lo/no : *élí íkpósó rì-lò / é-ló' vbì ìwè [the women PAP.be-DS be-DS
LOC house] ‘The women are in the house’.
LCT noun phrases contrast regarding NP type, animacy and syntax. Similar
constraints affect ri and e. The initial noun phrase in LCT constructions has few
restrictions. It shows subject position properties. The noun phrase preceding ri accepts nominative pronouns, not emphatic pronouns or indefinite subject pronoun a.
It disallows deictic locative pronouns (e.g. ááìn ‘there’).

Complex predicates show deictic motion verbs in the expression of locative goal
relations. Two verbs differentiated by aspect are involved. Deictic verbs vare ‘came,
will come’ or vade ‘comes, coming’ each take a locative vbì complement as V2 in
series. A third deictic verb lode ‘go’ appears only as a simple predicate. It fails to
occur in complex predicates.

Event motion is directed toward the speakerDeictic directional participants | 659and the vare goal. V1 in complex vare predications consists of verbs that are transitive (e.g. sua ‘push,’ fioo ‘blow,’ nwu ‘take/carry’) or intransitive (e.g. la ‘run’). Predication sense is ‘move to speaker or reference point.’

As a simple predicate, vade and its vbi complement express direction of motion
relative to a locative reference point and speaker. Motion is toward reference point
and speaker when vbi follows vade. However, it is from reference point and toward
an assumed, unstated speaker position when vbi phrase and verb za in series precede vade. Speaker position in za constructions is assumed to be distinct from vbi
marked reference point. In addition, vade disallows syntactic expression of combined ‘from to’ phrases.

position rejects nonhuman animates (ófè), liquids (ìòghò) or inanimate referents
(ùgbòfì). A nominal referent capable of internally initiated movement (ólì ìmátò ‘the

Complex predications with deictic vade reveal additional properties when expressing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as
argument repositioning in discourse. Complex vade predications restrict aspect.
They do not inflect for Past and Present perfect. They also do not inflect with Continuous morphology. Instead, vade imposes on V1 the tone pattern associated with
Continuous (right edge low tone subject phrase and low tone event verb, e.g. nwù).

The deictic verb lode ‘go’ appears only in simple predications. It fails in complex
predications. As a simple predicate, lode takes a following vbi phrase complement.
It never occurs with a preceding vbi phrase and verb za ‘be located’ in series. lode
expresses direction of motion relative to a locative reference point and speaker.
Motion is toward the reference point and away from the speaker. Speaker position in
lode predications is assumed to be distinct from locative reference point. Moreover,
combining za and lode to express a source goal construction is disallowed.

liquid, natural force or inanimate subjects. It also does not allow nouns referring to
entities capable of internally initiated movement (ólì ìmátò ‘the car’).

Simple predications with deictic lode disclose additional properties in constructions conveying sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as
well as argument repositioning in discourse. Simple lode predications limit aspect.
They inflect for imperfect Continuous, although in an irregular fashion that relies
exclusively on tone. lode shows an initial low tone and a right edge low tone subject

Complex predicates articulate a relation of source and goal with za ‘move/be located’ and its locative vbi complement as V1 in series. V2 consists of either ye ‘move
toward,’ se ‘move as far as/ reach’ or de re ‘fall to.’ Predication sense is ‘from location X to location Y.’
Source-Goal (SG) predications differentially articulate horizontal and vertical
motion as well as spatial and temporal extent. Motion on the horizontal plane with
no expression of manner is conveyed by za in series with ye. za and its complement
must precede ye and its complement, as is the case with all SG predications. A reversal in the order of these verb phrases, i.e. goal then source, is unacceptable.

vbí áfúzé' yé

the man PRP.be.loc LOC Afuze move.to Oke
‘The man moved from Afuze to Oke.’
To express manner of motion from source to goal on the horizontal plane, za occurs
in series with verb se and a manner verb (e.g. transitive sua ‘push,’ fioo ‘blow,’ intransitive la ‘run’). The manner verb follows za but precedes se.

Extent of a temporal nature from source time to goal time is formed with za in series
with se and an intervening activity verb like gbe ‘dance.’ In these predications, gbe
cannot precede za.

vbí égbíà
gbé sé
vbí énwáà.
he PAP.be.loc LOC morning dance reach LOC evening
‘He danced from morning to evening.’
As indicated above, noun phrases serving as vbi complements in SG constructions
accept place or temporal nouns. With a human (ójé) or animate noun as reference
point, syntactic elaboration is required. For example, source and goal can each
show a pronominally headed relative clause framed by ri ‘be located.’670 | Participant expressing complex predicates(280) ò zá

Complex SG predications do not deconstruct strictly as simple verbs, although
they appear to share NP1. V1 za never occurs as a simple predicate with NP1 as subject and NP2 as locative complement. Even when manner is expressed, V1 za and a
following manner verb like sua ‘push’ are unacceptable.

In addition, it is important to recognize that not every participant in a serial verb construction
serves as an event argument, where argument refers to a relation entailed by an event. This seems
particularly the case with substitutive, comitative and sociative participant roles that follow V1 in
serial verb constructions and the comparative participant role that occurs as V2 in series.","[681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697]"

Factuality verbs express fact-based information as related to the knowledge state of
their grammatical subject. They include mie ‘find out,’ oo ‘suppose,’ ga ze ‘discover,’
de ‘discover’ and vbohie ‘dream.’ None manifests a ditransitive form. Moreover, mie
and oo are limited to first person subjects. vbohie figures in complex predicates with
mie to modulate situational aspect of complement content. Factuality verbs are
limited to khi marked S-complements. They reject those marked by li, si or IQ. Further, factuality verbs limit aspect to the perfect and, except for polar interrogatives,
tend to restrict polarity and mood expression. Complement types with factuality
verbs are embedded as direct objects. None but that of mie corresponds to an interrogative pronoun and none corresponds to manner demonstrative pronoun ìyó ‘so.’
Overwhelmingly, factuality verbs constrain subject identity across complement and
matrix clauses by rejecting logophoric pronouns. Additional properties emerge from
consideration of each verb and its S-complements.","[871, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876]"

Aspectual extent adverbs articulate the nature of event end state (or result) as complete or partial. Most extent adverbs are severely restricted relative to their verbs.
They occur with only a single verb or a small subset of verbs with like semantic
properties. Aspectual extent forms correspond to direct question frames with
ébé'/ébí'…i…se. A few selected adverbs suggest the character of this subclass: sésésé
‘completely, neatly,’ jáún ‘completely,’ gbègbéí ‘completely’ and ghéghéghé ‘completely to the brim.’

ground CS neatly] ‘The woman at one time swept the ground up neatly’).
Discourse repositioning of aspectual extent adverbs is severely restricted. Forms
like sésésé never occur in focus or topic position.

‘As for completely, the woman swept the ground up that way.’
The aspectual extent adverb jáún co-occurs with the complex predicate too a
‘burn up.’ Its clause inflects for Present and Past perfect as well as prospective Predictive. It rejects prospective Anticipative and imperfect aspect.
(88) a. ólí ógó tóó'
á jáún.

‘The bush burned up completely / to a crisp.’

‘The bush has burned up completely.’
c. ólí ógó ló
tòò á jáún.
the bush PRED burn CS completely
‘The bush will burn up completely.’322 | Adverbial adjunctsLike other aspectual extent adverbs, jáún corresponds to question frame
ébé'/ébí'…i…se. In response, jáún occurs in situ, not in a simple adverb phrase.

‘Completely.’
Additional properties of jáún are highlighted by several selected constructions.
jáún fails to occur in imperatives, prohibitives, polar questions or negative statements, as ungrammatical polar questions suggest (*ólì ògò tóó á jáún? [the bush
PRP.burn CS completely] ‘Did the bush burn up completely?’).
Discourse repositioning of aspectual extent jáún is also constrained. It fails to
occupy focus or topic position.
(90) *jáún

‘It was completely that the bush burned up.’
A third aspectual extent adverb is gbègbéí. It also appears in narrative discourse
as forms gbèìgbéí or gbéí. Aspectual extent gbègbéí clauses inflect for perfect aspect,
rejecting prospective and imperfect aspect.
(91) a. ójé vbóó'
ólí óókhó gbéí.
Oje PAP.pluck the chicken completely
‘Oje plucked the chicken completely.’
b. òjè vbóó
ólí óókhó gbéí.
Oje PRP.pluck the chicken completely
‘Oje has plucked the chicken completely.’
The direct question frame for gbègbéí is ébé'/ébí'…i…se. In response, gbègbéí appears in situ, not in a simple adverb phrase.
(92) ébé' ólí ómóhé í'
é émàè sé?

ó ì

*gbègbéí.
he NEG eat food completely
completely
‘He did not eat food at all.’
‘Completely.’Overview of temporal adverbials | 323Additional properties of gbègbéí can be discerned in selected constructions.
Like other aspectual extent adverbs, gbègbéí does not appear in imperative or prohibitive constructions. However, it is found in negative statements (ólí ómòhè í ì è ólí
émáé gbègbéí [the man SC NEG eat the food completely] ‘The man did not eat the
food at all’) and polar questions (ójé ánmé' óí étò á gbègbéí? [Oje PAP.scrape her hair
CS completely] ‘Did Oje scrape off her hair completely?’).
Discourse repositioning of gbègbéí is unacceptable. Even under perfect negation, gbègbéí does not occupy focus position or topic position.
(93) *gbègbéí
lí ójé ánmé'
óí étò á.
completely PF Oje PAP.scrape her hair CS
‘It was completely that Oje scraped off her hair.’
Slightly more restricted is aspectual extent adverb ghéghéghé, which combines
with a predicate such as voon ‘fill.’ ghéghéghé occurs only in clauses inflected for
Past perfect. It rejects Present perfect, imperfect aspect and prospective aspect.
(94) ólí émá vóón'
ìtásá
ghéghéghé.
the yam PAP.fill plate to.the.brim / completely
‘The yam filled the plate to the brim.’
ghéghéghé corresponds to the question frame ébé'/ébí'…i…se. Responses require
ghéghéghé in situ, not a simple adverb phrase consisting solely of ghéghéghé.
(95) ébé' ólí émá í'
vóón ìtásà sé?
how the yam PAP.MAN fill plate extent
‘To what extent did the yam fill the plate?’
ó vóón-í' ghéghéghé.
/
*ghéghéghé.
it fill-F to.the.brim
to.the.brim
‘It filled to the brim.’
‘To the brim.’
Further properties of ghéghéghé follow from selected constructions. It restricts
mood and polarity. ghéghéghé fails in imperatives, prohibitives, negatives and polar
questions, as unacceptable polar questions indicate (*ólí émá vóón' ìtásá
ghéghéghé? [the yam PAP.fill plate to.the.brim] ‘Did the yam fill the plate to the
brim?’).
ghéghéghé does not license any functions associated with aspectualizer preverbs ya (*ólí émà yà vóón ólì ìtásá ghéghéghé [the yam PRP.IG fill the plate
to.the.brim] ‘The yam almost filled the plate to the brim’) and mo (*ólí émà móò

They fail to occupy focus or topic position.
(105) *nyágán
lí ólí ómóhé ó ò shán.
awkwardly PF the man SC H walk
‘It is awkwardly that the man walks.’
A second subclass of manner adverb co-occurs with transitive verbs of consumption. Members include: tùzètúzé ‘wretchedly,’ kóíkóí ‘briskly, fast paced,’ súnésúné ‘clumsily,’9 and záízáí ‘hurriedly.’ Manner adverbs of this subclass appear
only in clauses inflected for imperfect Continuous or Habitual. They reject perfect
and prospective aspect.
(106) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émáé kóíkóí.
the man SC C eat the food gulpingly
‘The man is gulping / eating the food in a gulping fashion.’
b. ólí ómòhè ó ó è ólí émáé súnésúné.
the man SC C eat the food clumsily
‘The man is eating the food in a clumsy fashion.’
Manner adverbs of consumption correspond to direct question ébé'/ébí'...i ‘how.’
Responses show the manner adverb in situ, not in a simple adverb phrase or in focus
position.

‘He eats it briskly.’
‘In a brisk fashion.’
Relative to polarity and mood, manner adverbs of consumption appear in imperative constructions (è ólí émáé kóíkóí [eat the food briskly] ‘Eat the food in a brisk
fashion’). They they fail in prohibitives, negative statements and polar questions.
Manner adverbs of consumption restrict discourse repositioning. They do not
occur in focus position or topic position.
(108) *kóíkóí, ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
briskly the man SC C eat the food
‘Briskly, the man is eating food.’328 | Adverbial adjunctsA manner adverb with a distinct collocational range and derivational history is
ghéghéghé ‘precariously.’ Prototypically, it occurs with simple and complex predicates that convey hanging events. ghéghéghé appears phonologically and semantically related to the verb gheghe ‘position precariously.’ However, there is no synchronic verb ghe with the same or a related meaning.

in imperatives (nwù ólì èkpà khúán ghéghéghé [take the bag suspend precariously]
‘Hang the bag precariously’). It does not occur in prohibitives, polar questions or
negative statements.
Discourse repositioning of ghéghéghé is restricted. It fails to occupy focus or topic position.
(112) *ghéghéghé lí ólí órán dé'

event in preceding discourse.

Alternative forms articulate direct and indirect questions of Person. An interrogative
pronoun with the number shapes singular óe'/ói' and plural éé'/éí' frame Person
direct questions. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular o, plural e) occurs in matrix
subject position. For indirect object position marked by Applicative li/ni, a zero
pronoun corresponds to the interrogative pronoun for person.

Indirect questions of Person rely on the relative pronoun ólì/élì with its singular/plural forms. Question position in indirect interrogatives never accepts pronoun
óé'/óí' ~ éé' /éí'. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular ó, plural é) occupies subject
position. When the question word corresponds to indirect object marked by Applicative li/ni, the matrix clause exhibits a zero pronoun.

Direct and indirect questions of Possessor are framed by Person interrogative pronouns and relative pronouns. However, question shape varies according to direct or
indirect status. Direct questions utilize interrogative pronoun óé'/óí'~éé'/éí' as complement of an Associative ísì phrase, the entire phrase being in question position.

lí
ònwìmè?
goat ASS who the man PAP.take APP farmer
‘Whose goat did the man give to the farmer?’
Indirect questions of Possessor assume either of two shapes. When the question
position constituent corresponds to a matrix relation other than subject, the relative
pronoun ólì appears in question position and a personal pronoun (òí) occupies the
corresponding matrix clause position.17
(84) a. ì één

I PRP.know goat ASS one Oje PAP.take APP farmer
‘I knew whose goat Oje gave to the farmer.’
When the question constituent in an indirect question with Possessor corefers to
matrix clause subject, an entire Associative ísì phrase (éwé ísì ólí) occurs in embedded clause initial position. The relative pronoun ólí serves as Possessor. Subject in
the matrix clause then requires a personal pronoun (e.g. ó).

Complex predicates identify an implied quantitative state derived from event iteration as excessive with V2 gbe. As V1, gbe predications accept transitive (e ‘eat’) or
intransitive (gbe ‘dance’) verbs whose quantitative extent accumulates through
event iteration and is measured against intransitive subject or transitive direct object. Predication sense is ‘too much/too many.’

Complex predicates of extended change of material state include ku a in series with
verbs that show intransitive/transitive shapes. These predications manifest a distributive function where change of state is dispersed over an intransitive subject or
transitive direct object. Predication sense translates English ‘completely, throughout, all over,’ often leading to a cessation of referent existence or a condition of
uselessness. Occurring in complex ku a predicates of extended change of material
state is verb gboo ‘break’ in its transitive/intransitive shapes.

Additional complex predicates of extended change of material state show fi/ku a. In
this class are gbe ‘kill a singleton’ and gboo ‘kill a plurality’ relative to re in series.
Their change of state is dispersed over a transitive direct object. Predication sense
translates English ‘off, completely off.’ Important to this sense is the irrecoverable
change inflicted on the affected referent.

The verbs gbe and gboo with CS a also express the simple sense ‘kill.’ But it appears
that their final state ‘die’ arises by implication which CS a can confirm. Evidence for
this conclusion derives from ba kun ‘do in vain’ constructions (Chapter 11, 11.4).
Since they are grammatical with gbe, they appear to cancel the implied final state.

"Cultural and Linguistic Background
Emai is mother tongue for approximately 25,000–35,000 members of the Emai clan
in south central Nigeria. It is spoken in ten villages across roughly 250 square kilometers on the plateau between the Edion and Owan rivers of present-day Edo State.
Located at longitude 6° east of Greenwich Meridian and latitude 7° north of the
equator, this area consists primarily of tree savanna, allowing for bush agriculture
involving the harvesting of yam, maize, cassava, and beans among other crops
(Bradbury 1957). Serving as the principal political village of the Emai is Afuze. Other
villages in the clan are Eteye, Evbiame-New-Site, Evbiame-Old-Site, Ogute, OjavunNew-Site, Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhunmi, Ovbionwu, and Uanhumi.
The Emai-speaking region is approximately 120 kilometers north of Benin City
by road. It is connected in the south to Sabongida, the principal village of the related Ora clan, in the east to Uzebba, the primary village of the related Iuleha clan, and
in the north to Auchi, the headquarters of the Edoid language Yekhee.
As for the Emai people, oral tradition makes clear the absence of hereditary
chieftancy, a cultural feature frequent among Edoid peoples of its region. According
to oral tradition (Ogbomo 1994), the ancestor of the Emai people is Ima. He is said to
have fled from the ancient kingdom of Benin in about the 16th Century for committing murder. Ima and his wife, who also came from Benin, had a son Uzuanbi (Oyaibi). Uzuanbi, in turn, had two wives, Odidi and Oron, whose sons founded the Emai
speaking villages. Oral tradition varies at this point. According to one version, the
four sons of Uzuanbi and his wives were Uwuno, Urule, Ivbiame, and Uanhumi,
each of whom founded a village. Their sons, Uzuanbi's grandsons, founded the ten
quarters into which the four villages became divided. According to another version,
the village of Uanhumi is named after the son of one wife and the remaining villages
are related to three sons of a second wife. The sons were Uule, Evbiame and
Ovbionwu, whose names are retained, respectively, by the village sites of Ugbuule,
Evbiame-Old-Site, and Ovbionwu, all of which are located off the main Ora-Auchi
road and tend to be northernmost in their respective village groups. Each of these
villages serves to link the remaining Emai-speaking area. Villages in the Uule group,
from south to north, are: Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhumi, Eteye, Uanhumi, Afuze,
Ojavun-New-Site. Ugbuule no longer exists as an occupied village. The Evbiame
group from south to north consists of Evbiame-New-Site, Ogute, and Evbiame-OldSite. The Ovbionwu group consists solely of Ovbionwu.
As a linguistic entity, Emai is completely surrounded by Edoid speech varieties.
Its genetic classification as a distinct linguistic unit within Edoid is of recent origin.
Elugbe (1973) classified it as part of a dialect cluster incorporating adjacent OraPreface | ix(30,000 speakers) and Iuleha (45,000 speakers); Elugbe (1989) locates this cluster
more specifically within the North Central Branch of Edoid. While a word list supporting a cluster relationship among these dialects was not published, broader classificatory schemes have accepted the cluster interpretation, e.g. Hansford, BendorSamuel and Stanford (1976), Bendor-Samuel (1989) and Crozier and Blench (1992).
Even Christian missionary activity in the area has never generated word lists, since
neither the Bible nor a church hymnal is available in Emai.
Linguistic investigation of individual languages within the Edoid group is extremely limited. Other than Emai, no descriptive grammatical treatment, encompassing reference grammar, lexicon, and texts, has appeared for a single member of
the 25 or more Edoid languages. Perhaps the most widely recognized comparative
and historical analysis of the Edoid group is Elugbe's (1973) unpublished dissertation “A Comparative Edo Phonology” and its successor, Comparative Edoid: Phonology and Lexicon (Elugbe 1989). Also showing an exclusive interest in phonological
matters is Elimelech's (1979) A Tonal Grammar of Etsako, which examines the role of
pitch differences in words and short phrases among dialects of Yekhee spoken
northeast of Emai country.
Among other Edoid studies, Thomas (1910) presents a highly schematic grammatical and lexical analysis of Bini, the numerically and culturally dominant language of the group since establishment of the influential Edo Kingdom in the 13th
Century (Ryder 1969). Later studies of Bini amplify portions of this initial analysis.
Melzian (1937) is a descriptive dictionary from which one can infer grammatical
information at the level of parts of speech, while Amayo (1976) and Wescott (1962)
offer accounts of Bini phonology and morphology. Several linguistic studies of Bini
in pedagogical or descriptive formats have followed. Dunn's (1968) An Introduction
to Bini is a training manual prepared for the American Peace Corps and as such
couches most of its language material in a limited variety of dialogue formats for the
prospective volunteer. An additional pedagogically oriented study is An Edo-English
Dictionary by Agheyisi (1986), which is intended for use in primary and secondary
schools. Stewart (1998) provides a theoretical interpretation of selected serial verb
constructions in Bini.
Additional linguistic studies of Edoid speech varieties tend to be descriptive.
Ejele (1986) provides an overview of selected syntactic issues in Esan. Kari (1997)
provides a brief grammatical sketch of the Delta Edoid language Degema, which is
followed by a more detailed and illustrated descriptive grammar (2004).
As for Emai, an initial lexicon and orthographic statement is offered by Schaefer
(1987), while Egbokhare (1990) presents an initial phonological analysis. An extensive collection of Emai oral tradition texts is found in Oral Tradition Narratives of the
Emai People, Parts I and II (Schaefer and Egbokhare 1999b). This is complemented
more recently by A Dictionary of Emai: An Edoid Language of Nigeria (Schaefer and
Egbokhare 2007). Additional information on Emai is available in a number of papersx | Prefaceby Schaefer and Egbokhare published in a variety of books and journal articles. Of
particular relevance to the future of Emai as a spoken medium is Schaefer and Egbokhare (1999a), which found an intergenerational shift to English as home language in the mid-1990s without a commensurate negative evaluation of vernacular
mother tongue.","[8, 9, 10]"
"3.2.2 Evaluative preverbs duu, woo, kuku
Evaluative preverbs reflect speaker attitude toward event occurrence. They consist
of Evaluative (EVAL) duu ‘in fact but for no discernable reason,’ Preferential Evaluative (PREV) woo ‘instead,’ and Post-Evaluative (POEV) kuku ‘afterall.’ No evaluative
preverb answers a direct question. Relative to one another, evaluative forms fail to
combine in a preverbal phrase.

the man PRP.POEV eat the food TEMP
‘The man finished eating the food after all.’
Evaluative preverbs evince distinct constraints regarding inflection, modality
and relative tense. Each exhibits distinct inflection. Evaluative duu appears in Past
and Present perfect or Predictive and Anticipative but not Continuous and Habitual:
(ólí ómóhé dú'ú gbé ófè [the man PAP.EVAL kill rat] ‘The man killed a rat for no reason’), (ólí ómòhè dúù gbé ólí ófè [the man PRP.EVAL kill the rat] ‘The man has killed

"458 | Be, do, happen and havePAR subject position partially restricts impersonal pronouns.16 It allows pronouns for deictic demonstrative ònà and óáìn (ònà / óáìn ríì vbì ò [this.one that.one
PRP.be LOC them] ‘This / that one is among them’), cardinal numerals, e.g. èvá (èvá
rì vbì ò [two PAP.be LOC them] ‘Two are among them’), partitive existential quantifier ósò (ósò ríì vbì ò [certain.one PRP.be LOC them] ‘A certain one is among them’)
and deictic kindred élìyó (élìyó rì vbì ò [that.kind.one PAP.be LOC them] ‘That kind is

èvèvá).
Noun phrase positions in PAR constructions respond asymmetrically to repositioning in discourse. ri and e constructions behave dissimilarly as well. With ri, PAR
subject corresponds to a constituent designated as positive focus li/ni, negative
focus ki, or topic. PAR subject fails to correspond to an interrogative pronoun. In e
constructions, PAR subject never corresponds to a constituent in focus, topic or
question word position. Similarly restricted are vbi complements, which fail to correspond to any discourse position: focus, topic or question word.

Verb phrase properties pertain to polarity and mood, verb suffixes, inflection, auxiliary categories, preverb categories and postverbal particles.
Noun phrase properties include NP type, animacy, syntactic shape and correspondence to discourse defined positions. This same u form, in collocation with particular
nouns, also expresses a range of meanings translated as ‘act, behave, execute,
achieve, perform’ (Chapter 8, 8.4).","[483, 484, 485]"
"8.2.2 Age construction u / vbi
In age constructions, the forms u and vbi occur in complementary distribution or
they alternate freely. This alternation reminds one of the nominal classifying copula
u/vbi (Chapter 8, 8.1.3). However, the copula form does not allow deontic and epistemic modality auxiliary forms. Age constructions do. Emai age constructions thus
employ transitive u ‘do’ where English relies on ‘be.’

Intransitive u has the sense ‘do.’ When it occurs with a manner adjunct such as
lèsèn ‘well,’ ìyó ‘that way’ or ìná ‘this way,’ it contributes to construction sense ‘act,
behave, perform.’ Noun phrase and verb phrase properties in intransitive u constructions are partially constrained. It is the case, however, that intransitive u shows
polarity and mood potential and allows discourse repositioning of its arguments.

Intransitive u constructions do not constrain polarity and mood. They appear as

‘Don't act that way’), negative statements (ólì òkpòsò í ì ù ìyó [the woman SC NEG do
DMD] ‘The woman did not act that way’), and polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó ú' ìyó?
[the woman PAP.do DMD] ‘Did the woman perform / act that way?’).
The initial noun phrase in intransitive u constructions reveals subject properties. It permits nominative pronouns for each person and number. Even the indefinite subject pronoun is admitted, although only with imperfect aspect.

(óvbèkhàn), as well as nonhuman animate nouns (áwà). Except for proper nouns,
each requires elaboration by, for instance, the definite article. Bare common nouns
are unacceptable. Intransitive u subject rejects inanimate common nouns, even
when definite (*ólí ópíá ú' ìyó ‘The cutlass performed that way’).

‘Both youths acted that way’). Intransitive u subjects reject kindred élìyó and ódàn.
Intransitive u subject position allows most impersonal pronouns: demonstrative
deictic ònà (ònà ú ìná [this.one PRP.do PMD] ‘This one acted this way’) as well as
deictic óáín and contrastive ónóí (ónóí / óáín ú' ìyó [next.one that.one PAP.do DMD]

ìyó [one LOC ones one PRED sell PRP.do DMD] ‘One of the ones that will be sold468 | Be, do, happen and haveacted that way’). However, intransitive u subject rejects kindred pronouns élìyó and
ódàn.
Intransitive u subject and adjunct positions correspond to constituents in discourse defined positions. Subject corresponds to a focus li/ni or a topic constituent.

‘It was the man who acted that way.’
b. ólí ómòhè, ò ú

‘As for the man, he acted that way.’
Manner adjuncts with intransitive u occupy focus position provided Manner preverb
i/e precedes u in the matrix clause. Intransitive u manner-demonstrative adjuncts
never assume topic position.

‘It was that way that the man acted.’
Intransitive u grammatical positions correspond to distinct interrogative pronouns.
Subjects correspond only to interrogative pronoun óé'. Adjuncts correspond to
manner questions framed by ébé'...i. Responses require a manner constituent in situ,
not in focus position.

‘He behaved that way.’
Intransitive u constructions with manner demonstrative adjuncts restrain the
expression of verb phrase properties. Although intransitive u disallows verbal affixes, it selectively occurs with inflection, auxiliary, preverb, postverbal particle and
temporal adjunct categories. Relative to verbal affixes, intransitive u accepts neither
Perseverative Ci-, Factative -i nor Distributive -lo/lo/no (*élí ímòhè ú-ló ìyó [the men
PRP.do-DS DMD] ‘The men each acted that way’).","[491, 492, 493, 494]"
