"Demands and AblautC. The instructor asks each student yes/

If the answer is Áoⁿ, the student restates

"• In Omaha, a noun can stand alone as
a complete sentence. This can be as an
answer to a Who? or What? question just
as in English, or it can be an independent
comment. In either case, it means “It is
[noun],” where the “It is” is implied.
• To ask for the identity of a person, use
the question word ebé, “who.”",[374]

"328Lessons from Omaha Language Class at UNL12. 4 Questions: a with No Ablaut• To ask what someone does or did in
Omaha, we place a question particle, a,
after the verb. Both men and women use
this particle.
• The question particle does not cause a
preceding -­e verb to ablaut.","[398, 399]"
"• We do not raise the pitch of our voice
to ask a question in Omaha as we do
in English; a question sounds just
like a statement. For a woman using
a verb that does not end in -­e, asking
whether someone did something may be
indistinguishable from telling someone
to do it. Example:
Gthíⁿ a?: Is s/he sitting?
sounds the same as
Gthíⁿ a!: Sit!",[399]

"• In commands, the difference between
azhi and bazhi is that azhi is used for
commanding a single person not to
do something, and bazhi is used for
commanding multiple people. In making
statements in the third person, bazhi is
a sentence-­level negative declarative,
while azhi may be used otherwise within
the sentence.
• Omaha does not seem to use negative
questions like: “Don’t you want it?” or
“Didn’t he read it?” All questions are
apparently asked straight up, as “Do you
want it?” or “Did he read it?”",[403]
"D. The instructor asks each student a
question that can be answered with a
“mouth” word. The student responds
appropriately, using a tha-­instrumental
prefix verb. Example:3. “Stop eating the food!” his
grandmother told him.",[510]

"Ttígax̣ e: Twenty Questions
A number of known objects are laid out around
the room. One student is “it,” and the rest close
their eyes. The one who is “it” wanders freely
around the room and chooses an item. The other
students take turns guessing what the item is, or
asking questions or giving commands to the one
who is “it,” to narrow down the range of possibilities. They can ask any question but what the
item is. Positionals should be used. When someone guesses correctly, that person is the next to
be “it.” Otherwise, if no one guesses correctly
within twenty tries, the person who is “it” must
tell what it is (using a positional), and the next
person in order becomes “it.” Example:366Lessons from Omaha Language Class at UNLCari (“it”): Wôⁿgithe ishtá thipˀíⁿza i a!

C. The instructor challenges each
student with a base word, and the
student responds with the corresponding
wa-­construction. While doing so,
students should use an appropriate
gesture. If the construction they envision
is detransitivizing wa-­, then they should
wrap the right hand around the left fist
to symbolize a verb governing an object
noun. If it is nominalizing wa-­, then
they should place the left fist on top of
the right hand cupped downward to
symbolize a noun with a qualifying verb
attached to it. Example:
Wagōⁿze: Moⁿthóⁿ. (“Steal.”)Grant: Wamóⁿthoⁿ. (“Steal.”) [with
right hand over left fist]
Wagōⁿze: Skíthe. (“Sweet.”)Cheryl: Waskíthe. (“Candy.”) [with
right hand under left fist]D. The instructor asks each student
a question that can be answered with
a nominalizing or detransitivizing
wa-­word. The student responds
appropriately, using a wa-­noun or verb.
Example:Wagōⁿze: Shêhitʰe sábe tʰe
thashtóⁿbe? (“Do you see that black
thing over there?”)
Will: Áoⁿ. Wasábe, ebthégoⁿ. (“Yes. I
think it’s a black bear.”)468Lessons from Omaha Language Class at UNLWagōⁿze: Watʰé níwiⁿ a? (“Did you buy
a skirt?”)
Pam: Áⁿkkazhi, íⁿčʰoⁿ wabthíwiⁿ bthé.
(“No, I’m just now going shopping.”)E. The students form small groups
of about two or three and take turns
asking each other questions that can
be answered using a nominalizing or
detransitivizing wa-­word. Using the
corresponding gestures with them is
encouraged.
18.2 The ī-­ Prefixī-­Before a Verb• In English we can apply the suffix -­er
to the end of a verb to make a noun
referring to a tool or piece of technology
that we use to perform the action. Thus
we would immediately understand the
purpose of a tool called a pounder, a
grinder, a cutter or a grabber. In Omaha
we can apply the ī-­ prefix before a verb
to get the same result. The ī-­prefix
can be understood as instrumentizing
because it signals the instrument used
to accomplish the verb’s action, and it
may allow the entire construct to be usedas a noun. In contrast, the separate and
distinct class of instrumental prefixes
described in the previous chapter turn
words indicating a condition into verbs
of action. Instrumental prefixes tell
of dynamic instrumentality, while the
instrumentizing ī-­prefix references the
instrumentality of means.","[538, 539]"
