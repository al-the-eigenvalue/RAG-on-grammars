The question marker à indicates a question with a yes/no response and can mark
non-verbal or verbal question clauses. This section discusses how it is used in nonverbal questions and section 15.3 presents its use in verbal questions. Question
clauses have the same construction as equivalent declarative clauses except for the
question marker.
The question marker for non-verbal clauses is most commonly clause-final. The
question marker à is independent from stems, evidenced by lack of [ATR] quality
change in the question marker in (44b).","[294, 295]"

The subordinate marking in the clause occurs along with these conjunctions as a
clitic on the verb, or clause finally, or both. It is more common for the conjunction
ār ‘if’ to be absent from the clause than to be present, although there is subordinate
marking regardless. As shown in 10.7, the verb-final subordinate clitic attached in
‘if’ clauses differs in tone from the clitic attached to verbs of other subordinate
clauses.
In (5c), the conjunction wàr ‘but’ occurs along with the verb-final subordinate clitic
=ī (SBO3). In (d), the conjunction ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ occurs along with the verb-final
subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) and the clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO). In

Questions are constructed using the question marker à or an interrogative pronoun.
Only the interrogative pronouns of (6b-e) agree in number with the noun phrase
which they replace. Some interrogative pronouns have a marked form when they
replace words which occur in an uncommon position in the clause, but are otherwise
unmarked. Other interrogative pronouns only have one form regardless of its
position in the clause. When any of the interrogative pronouns are pre-verbal, the
clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO) of 7.7 and 8.3.8 attaches sentence-finally.
When an interrogative pronoun replacing an adverb is pre-verbal, the verb-final
subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) of 10.7 is attached to the verb.

"14.6 Non-verbal clauses
There are two sets of copulas with which all non-verbal clauses are formed. The
most common set of copulas are shown in table 57 and are used for adjectival,
possessive, and equative clauses. A second set is used for locative and
presentational clauses, which will be presented shortly. With the limited data
collected, it could not be determined how existential clauses, if possible, are
constructed.

clauses and nominal non-verbal clauses. However, as mentioned in 8.3.1, there is a
morphological difference in the copular clitic attached to consonant-final nouns
(=Ā) and the copular clitic attached to consonant-final adjectives (no marking).","[290, 291]"
"178A grammar of GaahmgThe chart of (10) summarizes the criteria for determining which verb bound
morphemes are suffixes and thus a part of the stem, and which verb bound
morphemes are clitics and thus outside of the stem, but part of the word. The perfect
=r and relative clause definite clitics are attested to attach to more than one word
category, as shown in chapter 4. All clitics with the exception of the verbal noun
clitics can attach to all inflectional suffixes. Many of the clitics are attested to attach
to the surface-final segments of stems as will be verified in the various sections of
chapter 1032. Finally, one or more rules {M1-11} are not applied to some of the
verb clitics, as will be summarized in 10.1 and later shown in the various sections.
Although the four criteria are not all valid for any one clitic, none of these criteria
are valid for any of the suffixes. Thus, they each individually lend support of the
clitics being a different kind of morpheme than the suffixes.

"20A grammar of GaahmgIn chapter 9, the verb stem is discussed which is composed of the root and optional
slots for antipassive, causative, and modal or aspect morphemes. Aspect is marked
segmentally in the verb word—by completive and continuous suffixes. Past tense is
marked by tone on the verb stem—High tone on the non-past continuous suffix and
MH tone on the past continuous suffix. Infinitive, subjunctive and imperative forms
also add suffixes to the root. Deictic suffixes for each verb aspect and mode are also
attached to the root. Finite verb forms are inflected for subject person by tone added
to the stem-final syllable: High tone in third singular verbs, Low tone in third plural
verbs, and Mid tone in first and second person verbs. Chapter 10 discusses the
clitics of the verb word, including agented passive, passive, object and dative bound
pronouns, imperfect, perfect, subordinate, and relative clause definite marker clitics.
Clause-level syntax is presented in chapter 14 to show the functions of morphemes.
Agented passive, passive, antipassive, and causative morphemes are syntactically
distinguished in a section on verbal valency. Non-verbal clauses with two sets of
copulas are compared. Relative clauses, noun phrase agreement, and possession are
also discussed, among other grammatical aspects. Chapter 15 presents sentencelevel syntax, including coordinate and subordinate conjunctions, question clauses,
and subject and object focus. After some concluding remarks in chapter 16, ten
texts of various genres are presented in chapter 17 to verify the morphology and
syntax in the context of natural language.
All data represent both underlying and surface (phonetic) forms unless otherwise
marked. Where they differ, surface forms are written between brackets [ ], whereas
underlying forms are written between forward slashes / /. Many of the clause
examples are taken from the ten texts of chapter 17, which have reference codes.
Throughout the thesis, examples from these texts list the reference code and line
number in the free gloss from which the examples are taken. Pronouns, as in ūgg
ŋə̀lg ‘your (2pPp) necks,’ have a different set of gloss abbreviations than other word
categories (see the list of abbreviations and the discussion on possessive pronoun
abbreviations in 5.1).
Example numbers are indicated with parentheses such as (3), whereas rules are
indicated with braces such as {M3}. In 3.3, rule {M4} states that [+round] quality
spreads rightward from the root to all suffix vowels not underlying specified for the
feature [round]. However, roundness does not spread as specified in every word
with every speaker, but tends to vary from word to word and from speaker to
speaker. In this thesis, morphemes are transcribed as having the most possible
rounding.","[20, 21]"

10.10151IntroductionGaahmg (Gaam, enthologue code [tbi]) is a Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic language
spoken in the Ingessana Hills of the Blue Nile Province of North Sudan, near the
Ethiopian border. For centuries, the Gaahmg people have fought off invaders
entering their hills. Even today, their culture and language have been less influenced
by outsiders than those of other ethnic groups in the Blue Nile Province. Although
Gaahmg speakers outnumber speakers of other languages in the area, little
documentation has been done of their language. This work presents a description of
Gaahmg grammar, including its phonology, morphology, and syntax.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

clitic = n̄ is attached to polysyllabic vowel-final stems, and the clitic =Ā is
attached to consonant-final singular stems. The clitic =À is attached to plural
nouns, which are always consonant-final.

phonetically somewhere in-between the two utterances of (5). In stems with
underlying-final velar approximant w as in (a-c), the surface form is usually close to
having the velar approximant. In [-ATR] stems with underlying final palatal
approximant y as in (d-e), the surface form is usually half way between the
approximant y and vowel ɛ. In [+ATR] stems with underlying final y as in (f-h), the
surface form is usually close to the vowel i. Also, the faster the utterance, the closer
the surface form is to the shorter form with a stem-final vowel, regardless of the
underlying stem-final segment.
Monosyllabic long vowel--final singular stems
When the singular copular clitic =V̄n attaches to monosyllabic long vowel-final
stems, the clitic becomes a second syllable, in accordance with {M2} of 3.1. The
clitic vowel takes on all the features of the stem-final vowel to which it is
juxtaposed.

The copular clitic = n̄ is attached to polysyllabic singular nouns with various stemfinal long and short vowels in (7a-j). The clitic also attaches to nouns with
underlying-final vowel sequence such as būə̀ ‘tree type’ in (k) and to nouns withNoun word131underlying-final velar plosives g such as áŋɛ́(g) ‘elephant’ in (l). The language
treats these singular nouns as vowel-final stems, attaching the vowel-final clitic
= n̄ instead of the consonant-final clitic =Ā.

In non-verbal locative clauses, the singular or plural locative copula íīn/ɛ̄ggàn
separates the subject from the predicate. However in fast speech, both singular and
plural copulas attach to the subject noun phrase in the form of the clitic =A᷇n. The
singular locative copula íīn/ɛ́ɛn̄ of (26a) is replaced by the clitic =A᷇n attached to the
subject noun in (b). The plural locative copula ɛ̄ggàn of (c) is replaced by the same
clitic in (d).

It was a joy to study the Gaahmg language, in part because it is a fascinating
language, but also because of the kind assistance I received along the journey.
I am deeply indebted to my committee, Prof. Dr. M.P.G.M. (Maarten) Mous and Dr.
M.G. (Maarten) Kossmann. Working with them has been rewarding and a pleasure.
I want to thank Prof. Th.C. Schadeberg for his thoughtful comments on my thesis, as
well as thank the other readers. I also want to express my thanks to Dr. Leoma
Gilley, who was a mentor to me, gave me comments on several Gaahmg papers, and
was the first to encourage me to pursue a PhD. My thanks also to Dr. Constance
Kutsch Lojenga and Dr. Thomas E. Payne, for their time and input on portions of
my thesis.
I express deep appreciation to the Gaahmg people who shared with me their
beautiful language. Hashim Orta Adaw Madal made arrangements for me to work
with language speakers, travelled with me to the Gaahmg home area, and introduced
me to his family and home. Annaim Karaka Farajalla Yasin was an enormous help
in data collection, tirelessly producing paradigms and checking data. He
demonstrated love and careful thought of his language, and always seemed to
understand why I was probing for certain data. My thanks also to Safadin Hamid
Ateeb who faithfully assisted in data collection. There are many other language
speakers who assisted in other ways to whom I don’t know how to adequately
express my thanks.
The Institute of African and Asian Studies of Khartoum University granted me
permission to conduct the research in Khartoum. I want to especially thank Prof. Dr.
Al-Amin Abu-Manga for his kind assistance in making my research possible. I also
want to thank the Government of South Sudan who granted me permission to
conduct research on two trips to Kurmuk, in the southern Blue Nile province.
I am thankful for the support and friendship of my SIL colleagues who fielded
questions or otherwise encouraged me in the research. I wish to acknowledge the
love, support, encouragement, and prayers of my parents, who have always stood
with me. I am also indebted to my siblings, extended family, and friends for their
encouragement and support. I am deeply grateful to my wife Toni, who was one of
my strongest supporters from the beginning of the research.
Finally, I thank God with a heart full of gratitude, for He is surely my help, and “the
One who sustains me” (Psalms 54:4).","[3, 4, 5, 6]"

The negative particle wá always occurs clause-finally and modifies or negates the
preceding verb, verb predicate or clause. Since neither its position nor function
differs from adverbs, the negative particle can also be analyzed as an adverb. As in
(14a), the negative particle occurs as the last word of the verb phrase and may be
separated from the verb by verb complements or adjuncts. The negative particle
may also negate an adverb of manner as in (b) or a prepositional phrase functioning
as an adverb as in (c).

14.1IntroductionIn the previous chapters, various morphemes have been shown to be distinct in form.
We now present many of the same morphemes in their syntactic context to show
their function. Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb
forms are shown to be syntactically distinct. In non-verbal clauses, copular clitics
are shown to take the place of separate copula particles, which are functionally
equivalent but different in form. Relative clauses are morphologically marked for
definiteness and grammatical function, and they receive the marking instead of the
head noun they modify.
In this chapter, we first discuss grammatical function of constituents in 14.2 and
word order in 14.3, then verbal clauses in 14.4 and verbal valency in 14.5, followed
by non-verbal clauses in 14.6, relative clauses in 14.7, evidentiality in 14.8, and
finally noun phrases in 14.9.","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"

A Grammar of Gaahmg, a Nilo-Saharan Language of Sudan
door Timothy M. Stirtz
1. In Gaahmg, personal pronouns use vowel features to represent the person referred to,
the three persons coinciding with the language's three vowel harmony pairs.
2. Gaahmg has body part locatives which are similar in form and meaning to inherently
possessed body part nouns, but are a distinct lexical category. Unlike inherently
possessed body part nouns, they do not have person reference and differ in tone.
3. Gaahmg has morphological marking for both perfect and imperfect aspect, which can
both attach to completive and incompletive verbs.
4. In Gaahmg, tone replacement is used in the formation of genitives, antipassives,
causatives, and verbal nouns.
5. A fortis/lenis consonant contrast in word-initial and intervocalic position is common
in Southwest Surmic languages (De Jong 2004:145), but the word-initial contrast
does not exist in the Surmic language called Laarim (Narim) of Sudan.
6. There are five case suffixes in Laarim (Surmic) which have polar tone—opposite
tone from the stem-final tone.
7. Lumun, a Niger-Congo Kordofanian language of Sudan, uses pronouns and noun
concord reference to distinguish one participant as being more important than another.
8. In Lumun narratives with one participant being more important than all others, the
centers of orientation for direction words are locations that change according to the
movement of that participant.
9. It is ideal and possible to both analyze an African language and train speakers in the
grammar of their language at the same time.
10. Linguistic analysis of African languages opens new doors of amazing beauty which
inspires a person to look more outside himself at the world around him.","[352, 353]"
"Phonology27Voiced plosives and approximants
As the bilabial and palatal weakening rule of {P1} indicates, there is neutralization
between the plosives /b/, /ɟ/ and approximants /w/, /y/ intervocalically {P1a}. There
is neutralization between the plosives /b/, /ɟ/ and vowels /ɔ, u/, /ɛ, i/ word-finally
{P1b}. The velar plosive /g/ is elided intervocalically and word-finally {P2}, but
otherwise surfaces. As the plosive weakening rule of {P3} indicates, there is
neutralization between plosives and corresponding approximants for the first
consonant of a word-final consonant sequence. The dental and alveolar plosives /d̪/,
/d/ surface the same as their underlying forms in all other environments.
Geminate plosives /b
b:/, /ɟɟ:/, and /g
g: /
There is no phonetic contrast of length for any plosive in any environment. As will
be discussed in section 2.1.3.2, the underlying geminate plosives /b:/, /ɟ:/, and /g:/
are realized as single, devoiced unreleased plosives word-finally, and are realized
with little or no lengthening intervocalically. Since the non-geminate plosives /b/,
/ɟ/, and /g/ surface as weakened in the same environments that their geminate
equivalents surface as single plosives, they are never in contrast.
Geminate plosives /d̪
d̪:/ and /d
d: /
The plosives /d̪/ and /d/ are not weakened intervocalically or word-finally, but also
never surface with contrastive length. Intervocalically, the underlying geminate
equivalents /d̪:/ and /d:/ surface with little or no length. Word finally, the dental
geminate /d̪:/ surfaces the same as for the other geminate plosives—as a single
devoiced unreleased plosive, but is released elsewhere. The alveolar geminate
plosive /d:/ is not attested word-finally.
Voiceless plosives and voiced geminate plosives
Voiceless plosives are not attested anywhere except word-initially and are in
complementary distribution with voiced geminate plosives which cannot be
confirmed word-initially. Thus, voiceless plosives could possibly be analyzed as
underlying geminate plosives in word-initial position. In this analysis, there would
be no underlying voicing contrast in plosives, but only a length contrast4.
In this thesis, word-initial plosives are written as voiceless plosives since they
surface as such. Underlying geminate plosives in word-final and intervocalic
4Or, since consonant clusters are not attested word-initially, an alternative analysis would be
that geminate plosives are fortis (‘strong’) consonants and non-geminate plosives are lenis
(‘weak’) consonants.","[27, 28]"
"Normally, the underlying root vowel of monosyllabic, open-syllable nouns is long.
But in nouns such as t ̪ɔ́ɔ́ / tɔ̪ -́ gg ‘cow’ which have a short root vowel, the vowel is
realized as long in the singular form. In the plural form with final consonant, the
vowel remains short.
In verbs such as nág-gā /nág-d̪ā ‘sleep.SBJV1sN/.1pN’ with root-final velar plosive,
the velar plosive is elided in word-final position of incompletive forms {P2}, as will
be discussed in 9.6. The resulting monosyllabic open-syllable verb with underlying
short vowel surfaces with a long vowel nāā ‘sleep.INCP’.
The lengthening rule of {P4} requires that the minimal surface word for nouns and
verbs have at least mid syllable weight. The process does not apply to other parts of
speech such as the negative wá ‘no, not’ or the adverb tu̪ ‘towards, upward’. These
adverbs, which are separate words, are discussed in chapter 13.",[41]

‘worm’
‘lung’The suffix vowel of -Agg is assimilated to the preceding vowel when it directly
follows the last root vowel. In addition to roundness and [ATR] spreading, the
suffix vowel also takes on the [-back] feature of the root. For example, in (15g)
ɟìd̪/ɟī-ìgg ‘husband’, (15i) rɛ̄bbɛ́d/̪ rɛ̄bbɛ́-ɛ̄gg ‘reed type’, and (17a) bìmìríɟɟ/bìmìrí-īgg
‘bird type’, the vowel of the suffix -Agg becomes i or ɛ to match the last root vowel.
The nouns of (15) and (17) are analyzed as exceptions in that intervocalic d̪ and ɟɟ
This noun is irregular in that it has the suffix –Egg and the root vowel assimilates to the
suffix vowel rather than vice versa.
26104A grammar of Gaahmgare not weakened in other morpheme boundaries of the language. In (4) of section
2.1.3, we saw that d̪ of the root verb /cūd̪/ ‘climb’ is not weakened in the
intervocalic environment of the continuous form cūd̪-ə́n. Similarly, the ɟ of the root
verb /káɟ/ ‘bring’ surfaces as a palatal plosive when the deictic completive suffix
-Cagga is attached (káɟ-ɟággā).
Alternatively, one might analyze the nouns of (15) and (17) as having suffixes in the
singular and plural forms and the roots ending in vowels, such as d̪āɔ̀-d̪/ d̪āɔ̀-ðàgg
‘fertile soil’, àbbā-d̪/ àbbā-āgg ‘tree type’, bìmìrí-ɟɟ/ bìmìrí-īgg ‘bird type’, etc.
However, this analysis requires an additional singular suffix -ɟɟ and plural suffix
-ðAgg, the latter being unusual in that there are no other -CVC suffixes on nouns.
Further, when the vowel-initial past continuous suffix -An is attached to the vowelfinal verb root /pa/ ‘guard’, the suffix becomes a second syllable, juxtaposed to the
root (pā.-án), in accordance with {M2} of 3.1. However, the plural suffix on the
nouns in (15) and (17) does not become an additional syllable (bìmìrí-īgg), and
reflects a different underlying form. Thus, the alternative analysis is not taken and
the nouns of (15) and (17) are analyzed as having only plural suffixes.
In (13), the suffix -Agg was shown to attach to the root-final plosives -bb, -d̪, -d, and
-ɟɟ. It is posited that the velar plosive is included in the list of root-final segments to
which the suffix attaches. The velar plosive elision rule of {P2} in 2.1.3 predicts
that word-final velar plosives are elided. It also predicts that when a vowel-initial
suffix is attached to a root-final velar plosive g, the plosive will be elided in the
resulting intervocalic environment. This is the case for the incompletive and past
continuous forms of (18) with suffix -An. The deictic completive form is given to
make clear the root-final segment.

plosive is elided, the vowel of the suffix takes on the same features as that of the last
root vowel, just as in the nouns of (15) and (17) when d̪ and ɟɟ are weakened to

of (15) and (17), the plural suffix on the nouns of (19) does not become an additional

suffix on verbs with root-final vowels (pā.-án ‘guard-CONT.P’) {M2}. Thus, the
alternative analysis is not taken.

The plural suffix -EEgg attaches to root-final sonorants. About 17% of nouns have

"1.3The current researchThe current research was conducted beginning in 2003 with speakers living in
Khartoum. From April 2004-April 2008 the author continued field work in
Khartoum as a language research associate of the University of Khartoum, Institute
of African and Asian studies. The primary language resource persons for this period
were Hashim Orta Adaw Madal, Safadin Hamid Ateeb, and Annaim Karaka
Farajalla Yasin. All three are from the town of Soda, have spoken the Jog Tao
dialect from childhood, and continue to speak it whenever they are with other
speakers of the language. After April 2008, access to speakers was limited to two
three-week trips to Kurmuk in southern Blue Nile Province, near the home area.
The primary language resource person for this trip was Annaim Karaka Farajalla
Yasin.
The original data set of nouns and verbs were taken from word lists entered into
dictionary software by speakers of the language, which became the Gaahmg-English
Dictionary (Madal 2004). The singular and plural forms of nouns and subjunctive
and completive forms of verbs were written on cards and glossed in English and
Arabic. The cards were sorted numerous times to isolate segments and tone in the
same environments, and each time speakers read the words on the cards.
Texts were recorded on cassette, transcribed, and glossed by speakers of the
language, the recordings made from a variety of individuals in the home area.
Natural clauses were taken from the texts as frames for eliciting nouns and verbs
with various morphemes. The cards were again used to elicit multiple nouns, verbs,
and adjectives in the frames.
The data set on which the thesis is based contains 700 nouns, 150 verbs, 40
adjectives, and a handful of other parts of speech. There are 16 texts of about 30
interlinearized pages that have been collected. These consist of folk narratives,
historical narratives, personal narratives, persuasive texts, and poetic genres. Ten of
these texts are presented in chapter 17.",[19]
"188A grammar of GaahmgUnlike completives, no suffix is attached to incompletive forms. Thus,
incompletives generally have the same segmental form as the root, except that rootfinal segments weaken to vowels in accordance with {P1b}.

‘vomit’Incompletive as habitualIn Gaahmg, there is no form used exclusively for habitual actions. Rather, habitual
actions are described using either the incompletive or continuous, the continuous
form being the more common. For some verbs, such as ‘sleep’, there is more than
one form possible to describe habitual action: nāa (incompletive) and nāan
(continuous). For other verbs, the choice of incompletive or continuous form for
habitual action is based on the semantics of the verb. More study is needed to
determine semantic groupings that predict the correct habitual verb form.
Examples of incompletive verbs used for habitual action are given in (27) and
examples of continuous verbs for habitual action will be given in 9.7.

To refer explicitly to the future, tone is altered on the subject pronoun. There is no
future marking on the verb itself; the incompletive future has the same segmental
and tonal form as other incompletives.
Future incompletive paradigms are given in (28). In first and second person subject
pronouns, Mid tone is assigned along with High tone on the final syllable, resulting
in falling tone. In the third singular nominative pronoun, the Mid tone is changed to
High. With third plural certain future verbs, the third singular nominative pronoun
with High tone is also used, and the third plural subject pronoun optionally precedes
it.

and are not completed at the time of speaking. The past continuous form is used for
ongoing actions at a reference point in the past, whereas the non-past continuous
form is used for ongoing actions that are still continuing at the time of speaking.
Although the incompletive form alone can imply that the action is ongoing, using
the continuous non-past form makes the continuous action overt.
Continuous past verbs are commonly used in background clauses of narratives, as in
(29a). Continuous non-past verbs are used in expository and hortatory texts, as in
(b). Both are used in direct speech and conversations (c) and both are used
habitually (b, d).

root-final b, ɟ are weakened to approximants {P1a} and in (c), g is elided {P2}. The
suffix is attached to vowel-final roots such as in (o), as a second syllable juxtaposed
to the first, in accordance with {M2} in 3.1. In the continuous verb with root /kɔ/
‘call’, the suffix vowel remains unrounded (kɔ̄.-a᷇n). Continuous forms optionally
attach the suffix -CAn34, where C assimilates to the root-final consonant which then
surfaces as a single unweakened segment. Forms with root-final w, y, ð as in (l-n)
optionally attach the suffix -nAn. Some forms with root-final vowel such as in (p)

"9.2InfinitiveInfinitives are the most common form used in foregrounded nuclear clauses of
narratives, i.e. sequences of events. As such, they often encode actions that can be
translated into English as past tense, such as in (11). Infinitives commonly occur
following the infinitive verb dɔ̄ɔs̀ ‘start’ as in (11a), but can follow various other
verb forms and can be the first verb of a clause or sentence.

outAs such, infinitives are used in finite sentences. As discussed in 9.3, subjunctive
verbs are commonly used in typical non-finite contexts such as ‘want to X’.
Infinitive forms differ from finite forms in that they do not change with subject
person, either in tone or [ATR] quality. Also, the subject pronouns preceding an
infinitive verb differ from those of other verb forms. Singular pronouns of such
verbs all have Mid tone and plural pronouns have Low tone. Also, second person
pronouns are not clitics prefixed to the infinitive verbs, evidenced by the fact that
they do not take the [ATR] quality of the verb. Because of these differences with
other verb forms which change according to the subject person, this form which
does not change with the subject is analyzed as the infinitive.

All root-final consonants-CInfinitive verbs generally surface the same as the root. Since plosives and
approximants are not weakened word-finally in accordance with {P1b} of 2.1.3, it is
posited that a copied final consonant is added to the underlying-final segment which
surfaces as a single segment. Roots with final n as in (13h) optionally surface
without the final consonant and then with a lengthened vowel, in accordance with
{P4} in 2.3.3. Vowel-final roots add the segment -d̪ as in (o) or do not add any
suffix as in (p). It is possible that the vowel-final verb of (o) used to have final d̪
and that the vowel-final verb of (p) used to have final n, since these segments
optionally surface in some forms of the verb as will be seen in following sections.

‘ . . (but) the goat I am giving to the old men to eat.’ (Jooj12)Regardless of what grammatical verb form the subjunctive follows, it has the same
segmental form. In (a) it follows a verb, in (b) an incompletive verb, and in (c) a
continuous form.
Subjunctive verbs add the suffix -d̪A to the root, except in first and second singular
person forms, where other suffixes can sometimes be added depending on the rootfinal segments. A subject pronoun with Mid tone introduces the subjunctive verb.
Plural pronouns before such verbs do not have the plural marker -gg, and second
person pronouns are optionally [+/- ATR] regardless of the [ATR] quality of the root
vowel. The subjunctive particle ā is an optional alternative for introducing third
person subjunctive verbs, as shown in (14b,c).

‘say’Third singular subjunctives have various alternations which are only attested in verb
morphology. Those of (16a-d) undergo a coronal assimilation process. The rootfinal coronal consonants d̪, s, n, ð take on all the features of the suffix-initial
coronal d̪. In 9.5, it will be seen how the same root-final segments assimilate to the
initial s of the completive suffix -sA.
The third singular subjunctive forms of (16d-f) also undergo an assimilation process.
The suffix-initial dental plosive assimilates to ð, r, and w. There are two forms for
plural subjunctives with root-final ð as in (d): the root-final consonant either
assimilates to the suffix consonant as in fɛ́d-̪ d̪ā ‘release’, or the suffix consonant
assimilates to the root-final consonant as in fɛ́ð-ðā ‘release’. In (g), the suffix-Verb stem morphology183initial plosive may also assimilate to the underlying approximant y (kɔ́y.-yá) which
weakens to the vowel ɛ after the suffix vowel a is elided (kɔ́ɛ.́ -ɛ́). This assimilation
process to the root-final ð, r, and w does not always apply for every word with every
speaker, but varies from word to word and from speaker to speaker.
Rule {P1b} in section 2.1.3 states that /b/, /ɟ/, /w/, /y/ are weakened word-finally to
vowels with the same [ATR] quality as the preceding vowel. The same weakening
process occurs syllable-finally before a consonant-initial suffix, provided that the
underlying root-final consonant is not the same as the suffix-initial consonant. In
the third singular subjunctive forms of (f-i), b becomes ɔ (àɔ̀-d̪ɔ̀ ‘sit’), ɟ becomes ɛ
(káɛ́-d̪ā ‘bring’), w becomes ɔ (ɲáɔ́-d̪ɔ ́ ‘request’), and y becomes ɛ (kɔ́ɛ-́ d̪ɔ ́ ‘cook’)
before the consonant-initial suffix -d̪A. The [+round] feature spread to the suffix
vowel as in ɲáɔ́-d̪ɔ ́ ‘request’ is further support of the root-final segment weakening
to a vowel. Similarly, in the first singular forms of (f-g), w becomes ɔ (ɲáɔ́-nɔ́
‘request’), and y becomes ɛ (kɔ́ɛ-́ nɔ́ ‘cook’) before the consonant-initial suffix -n(A).
However, b,ɟ do not become ɔ,ɛ in the first singular forms àb-bà ‘sit’, káɟ-ɟā ‘bring’
of (h-i), and w does not become ɔ in the third singular form ɲáw-wā ‘request’ of (f),
since the suffix-initial consonant has become the same as the underlying root-final
consonant.","[180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"
"6.2.1Singular suffixesLess than 5% of noun lexemes in the language24 have singular suffixes. Although
there are five attested singular suffixes, only -d̪ is not rare. All singular suffixes
attach to root-final sonorants, and the suffix -d̪ also attaches to root-final vowels.
The choice of the singular suffix has no semantic correlation with the noun to which
it is attached. Virtually all nouns with singular suffixes also have plural suffixes.
The plural suffixes attached to nouns presented in this section are the same as those
presented in the following sections.",[98]

As shown by the contrasts in (14), six short and six long vowels are attested in wordinitial, word-medial, and word-final position. In monosyllabic nouns, phonetically
short vowels are not common word-medially; only four are attested word-initially—
îl ‘horn’, úld̪ ‘grinding stone’, ɔ̄ɲ ‘meat’, āld̪ ‘fox’, and ɔ̄d̪ ‘wife’; and do not surface
word-finally. However, phonetically long vowels are common in monosyllabic
nouns: they are most frequent word-medially, then word-finally, and a few occur
word-initially. Although vowel length is phonemic, there is neutralization of vowel
length word-finally in monosyllabic nouns and verbs. As will be discussed in 2.3.3,
vowels are only realized as long in that position. In polysyllabic nouns, short
vowels are common in all three word positions, and long vowels are rare wordinitially and word-finally.
2.2.2.2 Distribution in noun roots
The distribution of vowels in disyllabic noun roots is given in (15). The [-ATR]
vowels (ɛ, ɔ, and a) and the [+ATR] vowels (i, u, and ə) function as distinct sets in
roots; the vowels of the [-ATR] set never occur with vowels of the [+ATR] set in the
same root.8 Within each set, all possible vowel combinations are attested in roots
except i-u. The word ɟììgg-úúl ‘afternoon’ is a compound and literally means
‘evening-up’.","[34, 35, 36]"

together for comparison, and each of the three person forms are dealt with separately
in following paragraphs. In each of the three forms, a new assimilation rule is used:
M-H>M-M, which states that High suffix tone assimilates to preceding Mid.
However, the rule only applies in forms with HM root tone melodies as in (e) and
not in forms with Mid root tone melody as in (b). Thus, the assimilation rule is more
of an exception than a rule, and for this reason is not included in the
morphophonological rules of chapter 3. Where it applies in the derivations to
follow, it is marked with a diamond (◊) to distinguish it from the regular
morphophonological rules.

When a speaker uses a transitive verb and wants to indicate that an implied object is
unknown or is intentionally not mentioned, he or she does so by attaching the
antipassive suffix -An to the verb root. In (55a), the simple completive verb ɲām-sá
‘break’ is contrasted with the antipassive completive ɲām-án-sá in (b). For further
examples, see 14.5.4 on verbal valency of transitive verbs.

not all in the same order as in previous sections. The verb stem suffixes discussed to
this point have no underlying tone except for the past continuous suffix -A᷄n with
MH tone, the non-past continuous suffix -Án with High tone, and the imperative
suffix -Á with High tone which attaches to a few imperative verbs.

In all finite verb forms, Mid tone is assigned to the stem-final syllable of first and
second person forms, High tone is assigned to the stem-final syllable of third
singular verbs, and Low tone is assigned to the stem-final syllable of third plural
verbs. Thus, although many of the inflectional verb suffixes have no underlying194A grammar of Gaahmgtone, tone is assigned to the suffixes according to these tonal inflections for subject
person agreement.

various root tone melodies are compared. Mid tone assigned to the suffix in first
singular forms becomes Low when following Low tone, as in (c,d,f). High tone
assigned to the suffix in third singular forms becomes Mid when following Low tone
in (c,d,f). These processes are in accordance with the tone lowering rule {M9} of
3.4.3. Low tone assigned to the suffix in third plural forms causes the root Low tone
melody of (c) to be come Mid, in accordance with the raising rule {M8} of 3.4.2. In

rule {M7} of 3.4.2.

subordinate forms. First singular Mid tone assimilates to root-final Low tone {M9},
as in (c,d,f). Third singular High tone becomes Mid when following Low tone
{M9} in (c,f). Third plural Low tone causes the root Low tone melody of (c) to
become Mid {M8}, and in (e) the Mid tone of the HM root tone becomes Low
{M7}. For unknown reasons, final High tone in third singular forms with Mid root
tone melody as in (b) does not surface. However, when a vowel-initial clitic with
no underlying tone is attached such as the second person object pronoun =O, the
clitic surfaces with High tone (cɔ̄r=ɔ́ɔń ). When the third singular High tone is
added to incompletive forms with HL root tone melody, the combination HLH tone
surfaces as HMH tone in accordance with the combination rule {M10} in 3.4.4.

when the suffix -Á is added to some singular imperatives, it has High tone which
becomes Mid following preceding Low {M9}, as in (38f). Final Mid tone is

MH-MHMIn High-initial two tone root melodies such as (40d-e), the second tone of the
melody surfaces on the suffix, delinked from the root. However, in other root
melodies, the root tones remain assigned to the root. When three tones surface on
the past continuous suffix such as in (a,e,g), High tone is lowered to ‘half High’
pitch, being one of three tones on a mid weight syllable, similar to tone of the
accompaniment clitic =E᷇ described in 7.6.2.
In the third singular forms of (41), High tone is assigned to the end of the continuous
suffix -A᷄n (MH), which already has final High tone. In (c,d,f), the initial Mid tone
of the suffix -A᷄n assimilates to the preceding Low tone {M9}. In (d), the resulting
H-LH becomes H-MH {M10} when the third singular object =E᷇ with HM tone is
attached, and in (f), the underlying tone surfaces unchanged when the third singular
object is attached.","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198]"

‘in order to completely cut the people’Word structureBefore beginning morphology discussion on various word categories, it is important
to define how a word boundary is determined and how the terms ‘root’, ‘stem’ and
‘word’ are used in this thesis. The morphemes attached to roots and stems have
different functions, different morphophonological alternations, or in other ways are
treated as different kinds of morphemes in the language.
Word boundaries are determined by [+ATR] spreading. A word involves all bound
morphemes to which [+ATR] quality spreads; with the exception of a few
compounds (see footnote 8 in section 2.2.2.2), all vowels of a word have the same
[ATR] quality, all being either [+ATR] or all being [-ATR].
A root is the smallest lexical morpheme of a word and can be the entire word. A
stem is a root plus an optional suffix and can also be the entire word. A word
includes the stem and any optional clitics.
(27)Stem = root + (suffix)
Word = stem + (clitic) + (clitic)All suffixes of the language are a part of the stem and all clitics in the language are
outside of the stem, but inside the word. More than one clitic in the same word is
possible, but only one suffix is possible in a stem.","[68, 69, 70, 71, 72]"

11.3In (40), examples of nouns with three tonal allomorphs of a plural suffix are given.
The suffix of (a) has no underlying tone, allowing the plural form to surface with
Low tone, the same as in the root. Whereas, the suffix of (b) has underlying Mid
tone and the suffix of (c) has underlying High tone. As will be shown in section

grammatical distinctions made only by tone in nouns and verbs. Grammatical tone
distinguishes bound morphemes with different grammar, or is a morpheme in itself,
either added to or replacing underlying stem tone.
Tone distinguishes bound morphemes, such as the copular and definite clitics of
(41). The copular singular clitic =Ā which takes the [ATR] value of the root has
underlying Mid tone, the copular plural clitic =À has underlying Low tone, and the
definite clitic =Á has underlying High tone.

10.7Where tone is a morpheme in itself, it can be added to segmental forms or can
replace the underlying tone of segmental forms. Tone is added to distinguish subject
persons of verb forms and to distinguish future and non-future subject pronouns.
Tone replacement is used for genitive case, plural person possession of body part
nouns, antipassives, causatives, and verbal nouns.
In verbs, tone marks subject person agreement by being added to the stem-final
syllable. As shown in (45), tone distinguishes third singular and third plural subject
verb forms from other person forms. The verb root of (45) has underlying High tone
and the completive suffix -sA has no underlying tone. In such verbs, high tone is
assigned to the stem-final syllable of third singular forms, Low tone is assigned to
the stem-final syllable of third plural forms, and Mid tone is assigned to the stemfinal syllable of first and second person forms.

consonant takes on all the features of the root-final consonant and becomes the
dental plosive d̪ when attached to vowel-final roots. The resulting geminate plosives
surface as single segments. If the perfect morpheme were a clitic attaching to the
surface-final segments, among other differences the short vowel of pā-d̪ár ‘guard’ in
(o) would be long.

"9.11.1 Causative segmental morphology
The causative suffixes are -s+A, -d̪+A where +A is a back [+ATR] vowel taking the
[round] feature of the root and spreading [+ATR] quality to the verb stem. The
suffix -s+A attaches to form causative completive verbs, whereas the suffix -d̪+AVerb stem morphology207attaches to form other causative verb forms.

-d̪+AThe list of (61) compares the un-derived main verb form and derived causative form
of the roots /mar/ ‘buy/sell’ and /ti̪ r/ ‘die/kill’. In each verb, the main form differs
from the causative form by tone, [ATR] quality, or the suffix -d̪+A.

and the suffix -gg is required in all plural person suffixes. Although third singular
High tone and third plural Low tone generally occur word-finally on adjectives,
second person Mid tone is not as regular on second plural forms, as second plural
forms of (b,c,h) have final Low tone. Further, second person [+ATR] quality is not
as regular as in true verbs, as second plural forms of (b,c,g) have [-ATR] quality
({M3} is not applied). Among the adjectival verbs attested, those of (95) are the
most regular in final segment alternations, tone and vowel quality. Others are even
more irregular.

Preposition is a lexical category including four independent prepositions and one
prepositional prefix. Prepositions introduce noun phrases which function as
modifiers or adjuncts of the preceding noun or verb. Four independent prepositions
can have the same segmental form ɛ but differ in tone or grammatical marking on
the prepositional phrase. The animate accompaniment preposition ɛ̀ ‘with’ has Low
tone, the inanimate preposition ɛ̄ ‘with’ has Mid tone, and the general preposition ɛ́,
í (GP) has High tone. The general preposition has free variation in vowel quality
regardless of the [ATR] quality of surrounding words. When the general preposition
is used to introduce a genitive phrase, the noun following the preposition undergoes
a tone change. The preposition marker prefix d̪- is used for introducing phrases with
initial pronouns.

The preposition ɛ̀ ‘with’ having Low tone is used for introducing animate
accompaniment phrases. In such phrases, the accompaniment marker clitic =E᷇
attaches to the final word of the accompaniment phrase. The accompaniment
marker =E᷇ for consonant-final stems is attached to the noun āld̪=ɛ᷇ ‘fox’ in (1a)

The preposition ɛ́, í ‘to, from, in, at, by’ introduces adjunct phrases that indicate
goal, time, location, or instrument/source. Goal phrases can be used along with a
following locative adverb t ̪ɛ ‘there’ as in (3a) or along with a preceding adverbial
locative d̪umuun ‘far’ as in (b). The first prepositional phrase ɛ́ nāānd̪á ‘in day’ of

This preposition is also used in the formation of two conjunctions: ɛ́ gārá ‘when,
while (lit. by place.DEF)’, ɛ́ kɔ̄rá ‘because (lit. by word.DEF)’. Conjunction is another
lexical category and discussed in 15.2. In 13.4, it will be shown that the general
preposition introduces prepositional phrases used as adjuncts indicating time ɛ́
nāānd̪=á yāàn ‘another day (lit. at day another)’.
The general preposition is also used to introduce genitive phrases which indicate
possession, or close relation of certain objects or actions. In such phrases, the noun
following the preposition undergoes a tone change and is the possessor of the noun
preceding the preposition, or is the noun to which the preceding noun is closely
related. In (4a), the ɲɛ̄ɛr̄ ɛ̄ma᷆=n ‘devil.GEN=DEF’ is the possessor of ɲālg ‘children’.
In (b), the word preceding the genitive phrase is a verb and the genitive phrase
functions as an adjunct. As discussed in 6.5, the tone of each genitive noun has
Mid-Low or High-Low, regardless of the root tone.

agented passive clauses as in (5).

The consonant prefix d̪- is used instead of the independent general preposition ɛ́ (GP)
when marking prepositional phrases beginning with possessive pronouns,
prepositional pronouns, locative prepositional pronouns, or inherently possessed
body parts—all of which are vowel-initial.37
In (6a), the preposition attaches to the possessive pronoun ɛ̄ ‘his’ of the possessive
phrase to indicate ‘in his chest’. In (b), the preposition attaches to the prepositional
pronoun -a᷇ggá ‘us’ to indicate ‘from us’. In (c), the preposition attaches to the
locative prepositional pronoun -ɛ́ɛɲ́ ‘behind.3sO’ to indicate ‘to behind him’. In (d),
the preposition attaches to the possessed body part noun ɔ̄ɔɲ̄ to indicate ‘on your
back’. In (a,d), the prepositional phrases have the role of location, in (b) the role of
source, and in (c) the role of goal.

Some adverbs of direction have the syntactic function of prepositions, introducing a
noun phrase. In (7a), the adverb d̪ūmùùn ‘towards’ introduces the noun phrase
wāālg ‘water.source in’. Sometimes adverbs of direction introduce other adverbs of
direction as in (b), where the first adverb functions as a preposition, and the second
functions as a noun phrase. In both example (a) and (b), the prepositional phrase
functions as an adjunct, describing the location of the action.

Locative phrases can consist of a noun of reference followed by a body part
functioning as a locative, which in this thesis is called a ‘body part locative’. Body
part locatives are analyzed categorically as locatives in that the original body part
noun has become a grammaticalized form which no longer refers to person. In
5.2.4, it was shown that the vowels of inherently possessed body part nouns
correspond to the person possessing the nouns. Such body parts used as locatives
may have generalized first or second person vowels when used for the location of
third person nouns.

‘ . . as he remained in the tree.’ (Nyee35)In (1), ɔ́ɔĺ ‘up’ is a body part locative with the same segmental form as ɔ̄ɔl̄ ‘your
head (2sPs)’. The noun ɔ̄ɔl̄ ‘your head’ is a second person singular inherently
possessed singular body part requiring a person marker vowel. In contrast, the
locative ɔ́ɔĺ ‘up’ is used with the third singular noun ūfú ‘tree’, and the vowel ɔɔ no
longer refers to person. In this way, the body part has become grammaticalized as a
locative rather than as a body part. The second person vowel of the locative form
ɔ́ɔĺ ‘up’ is random in that other body part locatives use first person or third person
vowels.
As will be discussed in 14.9.3, possession of body part nouns is different than for
other nouns in that the possessor precedes the body part (ɟɛ̄n lúd̪ ‘person’s leg’)
instead of following and in the genitive case (gàd̪ááɛ̀ ɛ́ ɟɛ̂n ‘basket of person.GEN’).
The construction of locative phrases with body part locatives resembles that of
possessed body parts—the body part follows the possessor and the body part
locative follows the noun of reference. However, since ɔ́ɔĺ ‘up’ and other singular
body part locatives can describe the location of any singular person noun or
pronoun, the locative is a grammaticalized form which no longer refers to any
person.
In (2), body part nouns and the corresponding body part locatives are listed in both
singular and plural forms along with their meanings. All body part locatives have
the same segmental form as the corresponding body part noun; however, locatives
(a-c) which are inherently possessed body parts have different tone than the
corresponding body part nouns. Locatives which are inherently possessed body
parts include a person marker vowel only because the body part cannot occur
without one. The person marker vowel does not represent any person in its locative
usage unless the prepositional prefix d̪- is attached, as discussed shortly. As to
which of the three vowel-person forms the grammticalized body part employs,
appears random. The locative of (a) uses the third person vowel, the locative of (b)266A grammar of Gaahmguses the second person vowel, and the locative of (c) can use either the first or third
person vowel in singular locative form, but only the first person vowel in plural
form.

beneathWhen body part locatives are used with pronouns of reference instead of nouns of
reference, the object pronoun is attached to the verb and the prepositional prefix d̪‘to’ attaches to the body part locative, as will be discussed in 11.4. Body part
locatives with pronominal reference are also called locative prepositional pronouns,
as discussed in 5.7.
In (4), the third singular object pronoun =ì attaches to the verb. The prepositional
prefix d̪- marks the body part locative as indicating a pronoun as well as a location,Body part locatives267and thus the vowel ɛɛ indicates the third person singular pronoun (d̪-ɛ́ɛɲ́ ‘to behind
him’).

meaning were ‘Fox jumped on his back’ the construction d̪-ɛ̄ɛɲ̄ (PP-back.3sPs;
possessed body part) with Low tone would have been used [see also (6d) of 11.4]. If
the meaning were ‘Fox jumped behind the tree’, the construction pə̂rd̪ə ̄ ūfú ɛ́ɛɲ́
(jump tree behind; body part locative) would have been used.
Locative phrases are adjuncts of the verb and are equivalent in function to adverbs
of place such as tɛ̪ ‘there, here’ discussed in 13.3. However, since locative phrases
have a different construction than adverbs of place, they are analyzed as separate
lexical categories.
Although body part locatives are analyzed as separate morphemes, the initial vowels
of some body part locatives are sometimes elided, undergo [ATR] changes, and
undergo tone changes similar to those of clitics, depending on the nouns they follow.
A summary of these changes is given here with reference to the list of (5), and
examples follow in the next sections. Elision and [ATR] changes only occur in the
singular body part locative of (5a) and to a lesser extent in the singular locatives of
(b-c). The changes mostly depend on the speed of the utterance, but also on the final
segments of the nouns the locatives follow. Tonal changes in body part locatives
nearly always take place, regardless of the speed of utterance. However, there are
no tonal changes for the singular locative of (g) and the plural locatives of (d-g) with
underlying initial Low tone. The examples that follow represent fast speech and
demonstrate the most possible changes.

220A grammar of Gaahmg,
A Nilo-Saharan Language
of Sudan
This thesis investigates the grammar of Gaahmg, a Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic
language spoken in the Blue Nile Province of North Sudan. The comprehensive
description provides an analysis of the phonology, morphology, and syntax.
Ten texts of various genre are given to help illustrated the grammar in context.",[1]
"1.1Gaahmg languageAt the request of speakers, the name of the language is written orthographically with
the grapheme /aah/ for the long vowel [əə]. The language name is pronounced
[gə̀ə̀mg], meaning ‘people of the Gaam or Ingessana Hills’. Other names for the
language include Ingessana, Gaam, and Tabi. Ingessana is a name given by Arabs.
Gaam is the word for hill, and Tabi is a hill name in the home area (Bender 1980:4).
Gaahmg is classified as a Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic language. Greenberg was
the first to list Tabi (Gaahmg) as a separate branch of the Eastern Sudanic subfamily (1955:62). Bender proposed that Gaam belongs to an Eastern Jebel Family
including the languages Aka, Molo, Kelo, and Ben Sheko which all have a first
singular pronoun with the segment n and other similarities. He added that the total
number of speakers of Eastern Jebel languages other than Gaam speakers probably
does not exceed 2,000 (Bender 1998:39).
The Ethnologue states there are 67,200 Gaahmg speakers, who mainly live in the
Ingessana Hills of the Blue Nile Province (Gordon 2005), bordering Ethiopia to the
east. There are four dialects: Jog Tao (Soda area), Buwag (southeast area), Kulag
(Bao area), and Jog Goor (northwest area). The first two are more closely related to
each other, and the last two to each other. Although the dialects are distinct enough
phonetically and lexically to identify a person as from the dialect area, they are
easily understood from one to another (Jedrej 1995: 32). The teachers, politicians
and other educated people mostly come from the Jog Tao dialect, which is analyzed
in this thesis.
There are three published linguistic works on the language that predate the research
of this author: Ethnographical Observations in Dar Fung by E. E. Evans-Pritchard
(1932), The Phonological Features of the Ingessana Language by W. J. Crewe
(1975), and Preliminary Gaam-English-Gaam Dictionary by M. L. Bender & Malik
Agaar Ayre (1980).",[16]

to which they attach. However, there are five suffixes which attach to a few nouns
in the semantic sets of relational nouns or body parts. Most plural suffixes are
unspecified for ATR, but there are two suffixes that are underlying specified as
[+ATR] which spread their quality leftward to the root {M3}. Further, plural
suffixes may have up to three tone patterns: no tone, M or H/HM. Plural suffixes
with no semantic correlation to the root are presented in this section and plural
suffixes correlated to semantic sets of nouns are presented in the following section.","[99, 100]"
"956Noun stem6.1IntroductionThe noun word structure can be ordered according to the schemes of (1). The noun
stem consists of the root and optional singular or plural suffixes. The noun word
consists of the stem, and optional slots for copula (COP), definite (DEF), locative
(LCM), dative (DAT), accompaniment (ACM), subordinate (SBO), and relative definite
clause marker (RDM) clitics.
(1)Noun stem = root + ({SG, PL})
Noun word = [Noun stem] + ({COP, DEF, LCM, DAT, ACM, SBO, RDM})Noun stem morphology (suffixes) is discussed in this chapter and noun word
morphology (clitics) is discussed in the next. All noun suffixes are inflectional
number markers that have referential meaning, whereas the noun clitics indicate the
role of the noun phrase within the syntactic context. Whereas inflectional suffixes
cannot combine with each other (*SG-PL), all noun clitics can combine with the
inflectional suffixes.
A primary distinction between suffixes and clitics is whether the element attaches to
underlying-final segments or to surface-final segments. Stem suffixes attaching to
noun roots attach to underlying-final segments, whereas word clitics attaching to
noun stems attach to surface-final segments. Vowel length of root-final vowels is
the primary indicator of whether the form is an underlying or surface representation.
In (2), the plural suffix -gg attaches to the underlying short vowel in t ̪ɔ́-gg ‘cow-PL’,
whereas the accompaniment clitic attaches to the surface long vowel of the singular
form (t ̪ɔ́ɔ=
́ nɛ̄).

However, the starting point for noun stem tone assignment is the root tone, whereas
the starting point of noun word tone assignment is the stem tone.
As discussed in 2.4.3, two-tone melodies on trisyllabic noun roots are assigned rightto-left. Thus, in the monomorphemic root mɔ́ggɔ́lɛ̀ɛ ̀ ‘maize’ of (3a), the Low tone
of the HL melody surfaces on the final syllable, and the High tone of the melody
surfaces on the first two syllables. Tone assignment for noun stems such as ɟílə̀bbə̀gg ‘water.spring-PL’ in (b) begins with the tone assigned to the root in the singular96A grammar of Gaahmgform ɟílə̀bb and spreads to the plural suffix -Agg having no underlying tone. If the
root tone were not the starting point, right-to-left tone assignment would render the
surface tone as *ɟílə́bb-ə̀gg instead of ɟílə̀bb-ə̀gg.

begins with the tone assigned to the stem in the plural form íl-ə̀əg̀ g and continues by
attaching the copular suffix =À with Low tone. The noun stem tone assignment ílə̀əg̀ g has the root tone îl as its point of departure where the second tone of the HL
root melody is delinked and reassigned to the tone-less suffix -AAgg {M2}. If the
stem tone were not the starting point, the word tone would be different. For
instance, if the root tone îl were the starting point, right-to-left tone assignment
would render the surface tone as *îl-ə̀əg̀ g=ə̀ instead of íl-ə̀əg̀ g=ə̀. Or, if the HL
underlying tones of the copular word form were assigned right-to-left, the surface
tone would be *íl-ə́əǵ g=ə̀ instead of íl-ə̀əg̀ g=ə̀.
In summary, we can say there are four criteria for determining which noun bound
morphemes are suffixes and thus a part of the stem, and which noun bound
morphemes are clitics and thus outside of the stem, but a part of the word. In
chapter 4, each of the morphemes listed in (4) below is shown to attach to more than
one word category. As will be shown in the respective sections of chapter 7, all
noun clitics attach to the inflectional suffixes. Also shown in the respective sections,
the clitics attach to the surface-final segments. Finally, the stem tone assignment is
the point of departure in tone assignment for the clitics. These criteria are not valid
for the inflectional number suffixes. Thus, the clitics are analyzed as being a
different kind of morpheme than the suffixes.

Stem tone assignment is the point of departureInflectional number marking with the suffix –gg occurs on both nouns and
adjectives and is one possible exception of a suffix attaching to more than one word
category, as do clitics. However, there are many other plural suffixes attaching toNoun stem97nouns which do not attach to adjectives. In contrast, all allophonic clitics (with
different forms and the same function) attach to each word category.
First, the segmental suffixes in plural formation are discussed in 6.2. Then the tonal
allomorphs of various suffixes and tone assignment are discussed in 6.3. Body
parts, a class of nouns which take special plural formation, are discussed in 6.4.
Finally, the genitive case, which only involves a tonal change, will be presented in
6.5.","[95, 96, 97, 98]"
"2.4.1Tonal contrasts in the same syllable structureThe words in (28) have contrastive tone melodies for the specified syllable
structures. Three level, three falling, and three rising tone melodies are attested in
the CVVC syllable type. There is also one attested monosyllabic root with three
tones (d̪ùûl ‘instrument’). The same tone melodies and additional tone melodies are
attested in disyllabic syllable patterns, although not all in the same syllable pattern.
The singular suffix -d̪ of ɲíī-d̪ ‘tooth’ and of several other nouns in (28) does not add
tone, as will be discussed in section 6.3.1. The contrasts support the claim of there
being minimally three underlying tones in the language.

"6.2.3Plural suffixes on semantically defined sets of nounsThe remaining segmental plural suffixes are listed in table 11 and are attached toNoun stem107less than 5% of nouns, most of which belong to certain semantically defined sets of
nouns. In these sets, the semantic correlation of the nouns with the suffix is clear,
although there are many exceptions. The suffixes -AAd̪ and -d̪ are commonly
attached to kinship terms, and the suffixes -əgg, -V+g and -+g, are commonly
attached to body parts. The suffix -AAd̪ is underlyingly specified as [-round], the
suffixes -V+g and -+g are specified as [+ATR], and V is a person marker vowel.

2The suffix -AAd̪ is partly conditioned by phonology and partly correlated to
semantics. As for phonological conditioning, -AAd̪ attaches to nouns whose stem
ends in gg. The plural suffix -Agg in (13) which attaches to root-final bb, d̪, d, ɟɟ
and g, cannot be used with such nouns. In addition, there are five nouns not ending
in gg which take -AAd̪, four of which are kinship terms. There are many other
kinship terms which do not have the suffix -AAd̪. Only the ten nouns of (23) have
been attested with this suffix. Since the suffix vowel is underlyingly specified as
[-round], it is not affected by the [round] quality of the root.

"Introduction17Gaahmg speakers live in the hills and in the plains, interacting with other ethnic
groups in the surrounding geo-political area known as the Funj. In addition to the
related languages of the Aka, Molo, Kelo, and Ben Sheko, there are the Berta,
Gumuz, Oromo to the east, the Burun, Jumjum, Uduk, Mabaan to the south, Dinka
and Nuer to the west, and Sudanese Arabs to the north.
As Jedrej (1995) explains, the Gaahmg have historically protected themselves and
their hills from many invasions of outsiders. As a result, their culture is much more
resistant to change than that of other ethnic groups of the Funj. Mainly selfsustaining in what they cultivate in the hill area, the Gaahmg are slow to grow cash
crops or to migrate for wages. As a result of past conflict with Arabs and other
invaders, they have a reputation of being hostile towards strangers and even
refugees.
Although the origins of the Gaahmg are unclear, the Ingessena hills were alternately
raided for several hundred years by the Funj sultans of Sennar to the northwest or by
the Abyssinian kings of Gondar to the northeast, the Ingessena hills being a
borderland between these kingdoms that plundered for slaves and gold. The Dinka
and Nuer to the southwest raided the Gaahmg for cattle during times of drought or
flooding in their own areas (Jedrej 1995).
From 1820-1855, the ruling Turk-Egyptian Empire demanded heavy tribute of
slaves and gold. When they did not receive their demands, they attacked and
imprisoned the Gaahmg, taking several hundred prisoners at a time. The Gaahmg
fought back with speed and surprise attacks, causing many attacks of the Empire to
be unsuccessful (Jedrej 1995).
In 1888-1889, the Mahdi government raided the Funj area and the Ingessena hills in
particular, to provide for Khartoum during a severe and widespread famine, taking
1000 head of cattle from the Gaahmg on one occasion. The Gaahmg made counter
attacks and held Arabs captive for ransom at ten head of cattle per person (Jedrej
1995).
From 1903-1934, the Anglo-Egyptian Government was less brutal but continued the
same pattern of collecting tribute and squelching resistance. When the Gaahmg
attacked tax patrols in protest to tribute collections, the Anglo-Egyptian government
conducted ‘military operations’ which, although they did not involve taking slaves,
seized livestock and killed those deemed responsible (Jedrej 1995).
The main occupations of the Gaahmg relate to livestock, cultivation, or craft
making. In particular, the Gaahmg grow sorghum, sesame, maize, peppers, gourds,
and tobacco. They keep cattle, goats, pigs, sheep, hens, donkeys, mules, and camels.
During the dry season, young men and boys take herds of up to 50 head of cattle a
hundred miles south to the Yabus River for water and pasture. Some weavers,18A grammar of Gaahmgpotters, and blacksmiths peddle their products in neighboring towns. However,
livestock is generally not taken outside the area for sale, but herders wait for
merchants travelling into the hills for trade (Jedrej 1995).
Traditional religion and government of the Gaahmg are tied to localities. There are
houses of god, or shrines, around which communities are centred. A group of elders
in each community rules over and cares for the people they represent, deciding legal
matters and organizing activities. An appointed elder is the custodian of the
community shrine where ceremonies and celebrations take place. Each of the
smaller or less important shrines is grouped under four great or important shrines, in
each of the four dialect territories, which decide the annual festivals (Jedrej 1995).","[17, 18, 19]"
"5.1Person and number markersPronouns in Gaahmg, regardless of case or number, use vowel features to represent
the person referred to. Depending on the type of pronoun, the vowel may be either
[+ATR] or unspecified for [ATR], and the three persons coincide with the language's
three vowel harmony pairs as shown in (1): [+back, -round] vowels represent first
person, [+round] vowels represent second person, and [-back] vowels represent third
person. Pronouns are marked for plural number agreement with the velar geminate
segment -gg-.

3 refers to person; s or p refers to singular or plural person number; P, N, A, D, R, O
refers to possessive, subject (or nominative), object (or accusative), dative, reflexive,
or prepositional case (object of a preposition); and in possessive pronouns, final s or
p refers to singular or plural noun agreement. For example, the pronoun máà ə́əǹ (è)
‘my (1sPs) house’ indicates the first person singular possessive pronoun agreeing78A grammar of Gaahmgwith a singular noun, and the pronoun máàgg ə́nə̀gg(ə̀) ‘my (1sPp) houses’ indicates
the first person singular possessive pronoun agreeing with a plural noun. For
reference, the list of table 7 presents the most basic pronoun forms of this chapter.","[78, 79]"
"The syntax is equally interesting. Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb forms are syntactically and morphologically distinct
and combine in nearly all possible ways. All pronouns use vowel features to
represent the person referred to, the three persons coinciding with the language’s
three vowel harmony pairs. Body part locatives are similar in form and meaning to inherently possessed body part nouns, but are a distinct lexical category
in form and function.
These and other features make the description a valuable resource for NiloSaharan linguists as well as those interested in the typology of African languages.",[1]

There is little, if any, phonetically contrastive length of plosives in any environment.
The same is true for the approximants /w/, /ð/ and /y/. Although plosives and
approximants have little if any contrastive length, fricatives and other sonorants are
contrastive for length in intervocalic position of a few nouns, such as those in (2).

consonants of (c, l, m) surface in two different ways. A root with final vowel is
given for comparison in (o).
In (3a-c), the root-final consonants surface differently in the two environments of the
past continuous and deictic completive. To account for these differences, we
propose that the root-final consonant in the deictic completive becomes underlying
geminate through suffixation. The deictic completive suffix is analyzed as -CAggA,
where C is a consonant with the same features as the root-final consonant3 and A is a
back vowel taking the [ATR] and [round] features of the root. The suffix causes the
root-final consonant to be underlying doubled, but a degemination process causes
the geminates to surface with little, if any, phonetically contrastive length. The past
continuous form has the suffix -An, where A is an unrounded back vowel and takes
the [ATR] value of the root. Thus, the root-final consonant weakens in the past
continuous form with intervocalic environment, but not in the deictic completive
form where it is underlying geminate through suffixation.
In (3a-c, l-m), the root-final consonants also surface differently in the word-final
environment of the incompletive compared with the environment of the deictic
completive. We analyze the root-final consonants in these verbs to weaken to
vowels word-finally.
The verb forms of (3) are re-presented in (4) with the proposed underlying form on
the left and underlying geminates represented in the deictic completives. The
surface form is given in brackets to show where it differs from the underlying form.

The verbal clitic =E᷇, =ÉĒ indicates a third person agent (or experiencer) encoded
post-verbally in a prepositional phrase or in genitive case. The clitic agrees in
number with the encoded agent when in genitive case but not when in a
prepositional phrase. The clitic is called an ‘agented passive (PAS.A)’ marker in this
thesis. It is commonly used when patients or themes are in focus, being pre-verbal.
In agented passive clauses, an explicit agent is required and the encoding of the
agent is required to be post-verbal. Further, the agent is marked as a non-argument,Verb word morphology215demoted to a prepositional phrase as in (a) or in genitive case as in (b), and thus no
longer the syntactic subject. The clauses of (c-d) have singular and plural agents
encoded in post-verbal positions, where the clitics =E᷇, =ÉĒ agree in number with
the agent. However, the clitic =E᷇ of (4a) does not agree in number with the plural
agent káɛ́ggà ‘witchdoctor’ in the prepositional phrase.

or themes are possible in agented passive clauses and not clauses such as ‘*I am
needed by the hunter.’ Agented passive clitics are also discussed in the section on
verbal valency in 14.5.1.
Table 46: Agented passive clitic
Third singular subject =E᷇

=ÉĒ10.2.1 Agented passive segmental morphology
Agented passive clitics are attached to verb stems. When the root is stem-final, such
as in incompletive forms, no segments are elided, even if the stem is vowel-final. In
this case, the clitic is juxtaposed to the stem (pāā.=ɛ᷇ ‘guard=PAS.A’) in accordance
with {M2} of 3.1. However, final vowels which are not part of the root, such as
suffix-final vowels in completive and subjunctive plural forms, are elided by the
initial vowel of agented passive clitics (cɔ̄r-sɔ́ ‘help-COMP.3sN’, cɔ᷄r-s=ɛ᷇ ‘helpCOMP=PAS.A’), in accordance with {M1} of 3.1.
In (7), third singular incompletive forms with agented passive clitic =E᷇ are shown
with various root-final segments. The clitic attaches to the surface-final segments of
the incompletive form rather than to the underlying form, as seen by the long vowels
in (c, h, o-p) when the clitic is juxtaposed to open syllables. In (b-c, l-m), the rootfinal segment can optionally surface as a vowel or an approximant.

The agented passive clitic =E᷇ has underlying HM tone. In (8), it is attached to third
singular completive and incompletive verbs, and in (9) it is attached to third singular
continuous past verbs. In completive and incompletive forms, the initial High tone
of the agented passive clitic becomes Mid following root-final Low tone {M9} as in
(c,d,f). For unknown reasons, completive and incompletive forms with Mid root
tone melody and agented passive clitic have MH tone on the root as in (8b), but not
in continuous past forms with Mid root tone melody as in (9b).

syllables of suffixes, Mid tone is inserted between them on the first of the two
syllables. Thus, Mid tone is added to the continuous past suffix in (9b,c) but not on
other forms where there is an initial Mid or Low tone preceding the High on the
continuous suffix.

In contrast with the agented passive of 10.2, which always has an explicit agent in
the clause, the passive of this section never encodes an agent. Passive and active
forms are compared in (12). In the normal SVO word order of active transitive
clauses such as (a-b, d), the noun preceding the verb is the subject and agent. In (b),
the L-M tone (with L-H becoming L-M by {M9}) of the completive form indicates
the third singular subject while L-L tone would indicate a third plural subject. In
passive clauses such as (c,e), the clitic =ĀnÁ indicates that an implied agent is
absent from the clause. In that case, the patient (syntactic subject) normally
precedes the verb as in (c) but may follow the verb as in (e) and in (13). The clitic
=ÁnÁ attaches to stems with vowel-final suffixes such as the completive forms of
(c,e) and the clitic =Á attaches to stems with consonant-final suffixes such as the
continuous past form of (13) and to suffix-less stems.","[214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219]"
"Since all word-final consonant sequences are sonorant-obstruent in surface form as
will be discussed in 2.1.4.2, the contrast between plosives and approximants is
neutralized in the first of the two consonant positions. Therefore, there is also the
rule of {P3}.",[26]

3pNThe adjectival verb kāyáār of (35) has subject tone inflection (final Mid for second
person, final High for third singular, and final Low for third plural) and [+ATR]
second person forms, as do true verbs. However, in some adjectives used as verbs,
person inflection is not as regular as the adjectival verb paradigm in (35). Second
plural forms of some adjectival verbs have Low final tone instead of Mid (kɔ́ɔf́ àr,
kúúfə̀r-g=ə̀ ‘thin.INCP-2pN=COP’) and second person forms of some adjectival
verbs have [-ATR] quality instead of [+ATR] (bánd̪āl, bánd̪āl-g=ā ‘weak.INCP2pN=COP’). These features mark adjectives as being different than true verbs.
Since adjectives have some differences in syntax and morphology compared to both
nouns and verbs, they are analyzed as a separate category. Adjective clitic
morphology similar to that of noun morphology is presented in 8.3, whereas76A grammar of Gaahmgadjective morphology similar to verb morphology is presented in 10.11.
In the following chapters, word categories are discussed one-by-one. For each, we
first discuss the function followed by the forms of morphemes attached to roots or
stems. Because possessive pronouns are important for the discussion on nouns and
verbs, pronouns in general are discussed first, followed by nouns, adjectives, verbs,
prepositions, locatives, and adverbs. Each of these is a lexical category, as are
conjunctions discussed in 15.2.","[75, 76, 77]"

Only vowels of the same [ATR] set are paired in sequences, as shown in the list of
(16). All possible vowel sequences are attesting in roots except ɛa.

underlying vowel sequences. However, long vowels do occur in surface form vowel
sequences such as in ɲūūì ‘leopard’, where the underlying final-approximant y
surfaces as a vowel, in accordance with {P1b} in 2.1.3.","[36, 37]"

"2.3.5Ambiguous vowel sequencesVowel sequences before word-medial or word-final consonant sequences such as in
the words of (23) are interpreted as vowel sequences in the surface form. The
vowels in V2 position of the sequences cannot be analyzed as glides, since three
consonants in a sequence are not allowed.

word-final consonant sequences of (12), only sonorant-obstruent sequences are
allowed, as in bə̀rd̪ ‘lion’; word-final sonorant-sonorant consonant sequences (*càwr
‘rabbit’, *gɔ᷅yn ‘metal worker’) are not allowed. However, unambiguous vowel
sequences such as in d̪īə́rmə̀ ‘centipede’ and būə̀ ‘tree type’ of (16) are attested.
Thus, the vowels in V2 position of the sequences in (24) are analyzed as vowels.

‘tree type’Vowel sequences before root-final obstruents such as in the words of (25) are
ambiguous. The vowels in V2 position of the sequences can be analyzed as glides in
the surface form since all other sonorants (m, n, ɲ, ŋ, l, r, ð) are unambiguously
attested in word-final sonorant-obstruent constructions as shown in (12). They can
also be analyzed as vowels in the surface form since all relevant vowel sequences
(aɔ, ɛɔ, aɛ, ɔɛ, əu, iu, əi, ui) are unambiguously attested in (16). Although there is no
strong evidence for one interpretation over the other, such words are listed with
vowel sequences in this thesis13.
13In (12), the glides are written instead of vowels in order to show the full range of sonorant
possibilities in word-final sonorant-obstruent position. Otherwise, vowels are written for this42

‘planting seed’2.3.6Ambiguous final vowelsWord-final vowel sequences such as in māāɔ̀ ‘gazelle’ are underlying vowel-plosive
or vowel-approximant constructions which surface as vowel-vowel sequences. The
bilabial and palatal weakening rule of {P1b} states that the underlying plosives /b/,
/ɟ/ and approximants /w/, /y/ are weakened word-finally to vowels with the same
[ATR] quality as the preceding vowel. Unambiguous word-final vowel sequences
such as in būə̀ ‘tree type’ support this analysis, as does the fact that different
allomorphs of the accompaniment and definite clitics attach to stem-final vowels
rather than to stem-final consonants.
In (27), singular nouns and their accompaniment and definite forms are given.
Accompaniment singular nouns take the clitic =E᷇ for surface-final consonant stems
as in (a) and the clitic =nĒ for surface-final vowel stems as in (b-d). The language
treats (b-p) as having vowel-final stems and attaches the clitic =nĒ. Similarly, the
definite clitic =A for surface-final consonant stems attaches in (a), but definite
clitics having final n for surface-final vowel stems attach in (b-p).
There are no noun suffixes with initial consonant which attach to both underlyingfinal consonants and underlying-final vowels. Therefore, the root-final plosives /b/,
/ɟ/, and /g/ never surface as plosives as they do in verbs (/cág/, cáá ‘bathe.INCP.3sN’,
cág-gággā ‘bathe-COMP.D’). In nouns, there is no way to verify whether the rootfinal segments are underlyingly /w/ or /b/, /ɟ/ or /y/. However, although the definite

with short vowels (VC, VCC, CVC, CVCC) and open syllables with long vowels or
