‘Is this enough?’Examples (5)–(7) include an object. In these, the question is interpreted as being about
the object of the clause. For instance, in (5) the question is about whether or not ‘they’ go
to Kumurkek, and not about whether or not people are ‘going’. To interrogate the ‘going’, a
construction like (1) is used. Likewise, in (7) the question is about whether the aeroplane
will descend on ‘this football-field’, and not about the ‘descent’ of the aeroplane.

‘Does the aeroplane just descend on the ground, here?’Polar questions can be answered affirmatively in two ways: by ae ‘yes’, uttered with a
rising pitch; or by a gestural answer whereby both eyebrows are raised. Polar questions can
be answered negatively by using the negator fe ‘NEG’, or the interjection ehe ‘no’.
Negative polar questions are formed by placing the interrogative in clause-final position
following the negated clause. An example follows:Mood
(10)179ait y-awe
n-fon kaket fe
a
3M 3M-say 2-tie well NEG INT
‘He says: “Didn’t you tie it well?”’The scope of polar questions over more complex constructions is discussed in
Chapter 8. In that chapter, the scope of the interrogator is used to test the constituency of
constructions that involve sequences of verbs.
7.1.2 Alternative questions
Alternative questions are characterised by the presence of an interrogative marker a
following the second conjunct in a complex construction in which two conjuncts are
connected by fe. The form fe here functions as a disjunctive coordinator, and is adequately
translated as ‘or’. In this type of construction, there is a pause directly following the first
clause, and the intonation rises, as indicated in example (11). For a more detailed
discussion of disjunctive coordination, see §9.1.3.

The function of content questions is to request specific information about something.
Content questions are formed with the question words discussed in §4.5. In the clause,
these question words replace the constituent about which information is requested.
Question words can replace a whole NP or a nominal constituent in the NP, or one of the
peripheral constituents like time adverbials, location adverbials and manner adverbials. In
this section I will discuss the syntactic behaviour of the different types of question words.","[195, 196, 197]"
"174Chapter 66.9.5 Other semantic negatives
The negators peroh ‘wrong’ and kayie ‘it is not’, introduced in §4.7.5, can semantically
negate an assertion. In the following examples, kayie ‘negates’ an NP. Intonationally, it
belongs to the NP, and it is followed by a pause:
(195)Koru kayiè / m-tut m-ama m-hu fte tuoh Pamai
Koru not
3U-all 3U-come 3U-stay area place Pamai
‘It was not Koru (where they went), they all came and lived at an area
of the place Pamai.’(196)Anton kayiè / Atafonit m-anes
Anton not
Atafonit 3U-oldp-awiya33 m-hai ete
thing-who 3U-die belowataf
m-air me-t-o
irontree 3U-foot PRESTT-near-U
‘Not Anton, Atafonit, the old one, is the one who died at the foot of the
ironwood tree.’
The negator peroh is preceded by sentence-final intonation of the previous sentence and
a pause, and followed by yet another pause. Syntactically then, it is an interjection.34 The
assertion that precedes peroh is the one that is denied. Some examples appear below. As
indicated, in example (197), the speakers of each sentence are different people, that is, the
speaker of the second sentence corrects the speaker of the first sentence.

Interrogation is discussed in the next chapter.
34The clause1756.10 Clausal determiner
The form fo (but not to and no) can function as a clausal determiner. In this function, it
marks the clause boundary. A clausal determiner makes the clause more ‘definite’: it
becomes a ‘given’ in the discourse and draws attention to the clause. The clausal
determiner fo is glossed as ‘DET’.
The identification of a clausal determiner is somewhat problematic. Clausal determiners
occur strictly in clause-final position, and they are usually left untranslated. They can be
defined negatively: they are not attributive demonstratives, aspect adverbials or anaphoric
referents.
An example involving a clausal determiner appears in (200). This sentence, taken from
a narrative ‘sets the stage’ for the rest of the narrative. It is important that the listener picks
up the information in the clause, and it is therefore marked with fo.
(200)na pi
ait ø-tutu fò
/
then man 3M ø-chase DET
‘It is given that then the man chases.’The distinction between fo as a clausal determiner and fo as an aspect adverbial (see
§6.8.3) is fuzzy, as both occur in clause-final position. Theoretically, the two forms can cooccur, as indicated in example (201), but forms like these are unattested in natural speech.
The clausal determiner invariably occurs clause-finally.

So far, I have discussed demonstratives in several different functions, namely as
determiners in an NP (§5.1.6), as temporal adverbials (§6.8.1), as manner adverbials
(§6.8.2) and as location adverbials (§6.8.6). In this section I would like to illustrate the
function of demonstratives as anaphoric referents.
The demonstrative forms f-o and t-o can function anaphorically to refer to items in the
discourse that are already known. They are particular examples of what Himmelmann
refers to as ‘tracking use’ that is reference to entities that have already been introduced in
the discourse, and which help the listener to keep track of the story (Himmelmann
1996:240). The anaphoric use of deictic elements is common in Papuan languages,176Chapter 6although many of these languages seem to use the far deictic (which in Maybrat would be
-n- ‘far’) anaphorically (Reesink 1987:216).
The sentences in examples (204) and (205) are from a fairy tale. In (204) f-o,
underlined, functions anaphorically, referring back to ku m-ana eok re-f-o ‘these two
children’, which are introduced at the beginning of the example:
(204)ku m-ana
eok re-f-o
m-amo ø-sre

m-per fra ø-kron
M-ana eok f-o
3U-head two very.near-U 3U-step {stone ø-sound}
‘These two children go wrong, and they emerge below at the “sounding stone”,
the land Mare. These two step on the “sounding stone”.’In example (205) ana f-o refers to the two women mentioned earlier in the example as
m-ana s-aux ‘the one’ and m-ana s-auy ‘the other’ (both enclosed in square brackets):
(205)mah rapu

‘They plant something, they burn something and at night they sleep.’7MoodIn this chapter I will be concerned with mood, that is the way in which the attitude of
the speaker is expressed. Traditionally, a distinction is made between three basic types of
mood, namely interrogative, imperative and declarative. In the interrogative mood, the
speaker expresses a wish for information. In the imperative mood, the speaker expresses a
command or gives an instruction. The declarative mood can be defined negatively,
that is speech acts that are not interrogative or imperative are declarative (cf. Lyons
1968:307–308).
So far, the description of Maybrat has centred around simple declarative statements or,
in other words, statements in the indicative mood. In this short chapter, I will discuss two
moods that are grammatically marked, namely the interrogative mood and the imperative
mood. Interrogatives either contain an interrogative marker (polar questions and alternative
questions) or a question word (content questions). Imperatives are characterised by the
presence of an imperative marker re ‘please’ or by a distinct intonation pattern. The form
mai ‘PROHIB’ (prohibitive) marks the prohibitive. Syntactically, statements in the indicative
mood are unmarked.1
7.1 Interrogative
A distinction can be made between three types of question, namely polar questions,
alternative questions and content questions. Intonationally, all types of question behave in
the same way as other clauses, that is there is a fall in pitch towards the end of the clause.2
7.1.1 Polar questions
Polar questions, or Yes/No questions, are characterised by the presence of the interrogative
marker a in clause-final position. No variations in word order are required. Some examples
are given in (1)–(4). Examples (3)–(4) illustrate that the clausal periphery precedes the
interrogative marker. In each case the scope of the interrogator is the entire clause.
12Given that I assume that ‘mood’ is concerned with the attitude of the speaker, the category of ‘pseudoquotatives’, i.e. constructions which include the verb -awe ‘say’ and which express the thought content of
the speaker, could also be described here. However, pseudo-quotative constructions cannot be formally
distinguished from indirect speech forms, which also include -awe ‘say’. Because a formal distinction
cannot be made, pseudo-quotatives are described together with forms involving -awe in Chapter 8.
This is unusual, as according to the universalist view, questions are typically associated with a higher
pitch (see Ladd 1996:113–115).","[191, 192, 193, 194, 195]"

and people. To begin with, I thank NWO: research for this dissertation was conducted
within the framework of the NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research)
priority programme ‘The Irian Jaya Studies: a programme for interdisciplinary research’
(ISIR), financed by WOTRO (Netherlands Organization for the Advancement of Tropical
Research). Secondly, I would like to thank Dr Hasan Alwi, head of the ‘Pusat Pembinaan
dan Pengembangan Bahasa’, for acting as my sponsor, enabling me to carry out fieldwork
in Indonesia, and the ‘Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia’ (LIPI), under whose auspices
the research was carried out. I am indebted to Han Schoorl for kindly giving me all the
language material that he collected while he was in Ayawasi in the early seventies for his
anthropological research, as well as background information about people in the village
before I went there. The Roman Catholic Missionaries in Sorong, particularly the
Augustinian Fathers P. Tuyp, T. Tromp and F. Jonkergouw, were always hospitable, and
helped to solve many logistic problems. Likewise, my thanks are due to Father B.
Ngamelubun and Father J. Fatem in Ayawasi, as well as to the Sisters of the ‘Ordo Sancto
Franciscus’ (OSF), who initially put me up in Ayawasi, and were always there when I
needed them.
I am greatly indebted to all the people in Ayawasi and other villages for helping me to
gather data. I would especially like to thank Didimus Bame and Yan Piter Tenau, who
assisted me with many transcriptions of the recorded material, and Petrus Turot, my main
informant, for his time, his understanding, his lucid explanations and, most of all, his
patience. I thank Elisabeth (Lys) Korain, Maria Fanataf, and Yuliana Yumte for their
friendship, and the latter especially for refusing to speak Indonesian to me. I hope that this
description will do some justice to the Maybrat language, and will reflect the enthusiasm
with which everyone in the village taught me. I am also grateful to Marcel Polak and his
family and to Colin Ridsdale for their collegiality and comraderie while we were doing
fieldwork. I am particularly grateful to Wanda Avé, the ethnobotanist, for all the work we
did, and still do, together and for her warm friendship.
An earlier version of this work was submitted as a doctoral dissertation at the University
of Leiden, and was defended on September 15, 1999. I am very grateful to my supervisor
Ger Reesink, who supported me throughout the various stages of this work. His critical and
detailed comments have been invaluable, and it was he who taught me how to approach
descriptive linguistics. My promoter, Wim Stokhof, continuously cheered me on and
provided many useful comments in the final stages of this research. I would like to express
especially warm thanks to Bert Voorhoeve, our ‘veteran’ Papuanist and descriptive
linguist, who always managed to come up with questions and details that no one else came
xxi
up with, and which eventually greatly improved this work. Cecilia Odé helped me with the
phonetic analysis of my data both in the field and in the Netherlands: I am grateful for that,
and for our friendship that resulted from travelling and working together. In the final stages
of this work Professor C.L. Ebeling provided many detailed comments which have saved
me from some considerable phonological and other linguistic blunders. I thank Lourens de
Vries for evaluating the entire manuscript and suggesting some improvements in the form
of an index and word-lists. Finally, I thank Professor T.C. Schadeberg, Colin Ewen, Gunter
Senft, Hein Steinhauer and Aone van Engelenhoven for reading the manuscript before I
defended it and providing another set of useful comments. Prior to publication of this
manuscript, an anonymous reviewer of Pacific Linguistics commented on the entire
version, which led to a number of notable improvements for which I am very grateful.
I would like to thank my colleagues at the Projects Division for their practical and moral
support throughout this project. Mary Bakker supported me with many logistic matters, not
only when I was in the field, but also at home in Leiden. I thank Raymond Menick for the
discussions we had in ‘The Lambada’ in Sorong, on linguistics in particular and The Bird’s
Head in general. Ron Habiboe made the maps, and gave many tips on how to tame the
computer. Miriam van Staden and Aglaia Cornelisse meticulously ploughed through the
manuscript, and provided me with helpful comments. Elja Dekker was always (and I mean
always) ready to answer stylistic questions, and confidently predicted the ultimate
completion of this project from the beginning onwards. I thank Ruurd for turning round the
Maybrat–English wordlist, and for being my wonderful partner and father to our daughters
Eline and Charlotte and to our son Adriaan. Last, but not least, I thank my parents, to

man PRESTT-near-3M
‘Here (near) is the man.’(235)y-ama
me-t-ait
3M-come PRESTT-near-3M
‘Here he comes.’As illustrated in (232a), (233a) and (234), demonstrative forms that can take a prefix
me- can follow an NP. Some more examples are given in (236) and (237). These forms
function like clauses, and are therefore nominal clauses.
(236)ku
m-n-o
child PRESTT-far-U
‘There is the child.’(237)amah ro-Pastor m-n-o
house POSS-Father PRESTT-far-U
‘There, far away, is the house of the missionaries.’An alternative solution would be to assume that in forms like (236) and (237), m-n-o is
a predicative form, and to relate the prefix me- to the third person unmarked person prefix
m-. Compare, for instance, the negator fe ‘NEG’ in Maybrat, which can function both
predicatively (238a) and adverbially (238b):
(238) a.kak m-fe
meat 3U-NEG
‘There is no meat.’b.ait y-asah
fe
3M 3M-laugh NEG
‘He does not laugh.’However, if the demonstrative prefix me- were analysed as a person prefix m-,
then it would be expected that the resulting predicative forms would be *[m´»fo],
*[m´»to], *[m´»no] and *[m»au] (where ‘»’ marks a stressed syllable): person prefixes are
phonologically realised as [C´] if the stem of a form begins with a consonant, and syllables
including [´] cannot receive stress. As it is, three of these demonstrative forms are realised
as [»mefo], [»meto] and [»meau], where the first syllable is stressed ([m´»no] is the only
exception). Since these forms are phonologically similar to all the other demonstrative
forms, in which the first syllable is a demonstrative prefix, I will analyse the first syllable
in the presentative forms as a demonstrative prefix as well, and not as a person prefix m-.
The last adverbial demonstrative forms to be discussed are forms prefixed with fi‘similar.to’. Example (239) gives a contrast between fi-f-o and fi-n-o. In (240), fi-t-o
functions as an adverbial, and po fi-t-o functions as a nominal clause.

‘He arrives, like, at Kumurkek, it is like that.’ (i.e. an unknown distance is
compared to a known one.)(240)Demonstrative forms with a prefix fi- ‘similar to’ can also function as manner
adverbials (see §6.8.2).
4.5 Question words
Question words are used to request information. In a sentence, these question words
take the place of the constituent that is questioned. Interrogative constructions are
discussed in more detail in §7.1. In this section, I will discuss the morphological features of
the class of question words in Maybrat.
Below, a list of the question words is given. With the exception of ro-yo, the forms
under (241a) also appear in (204).
(241) a.b.c.to-yo
wo-yo
mi-yo

‘how?’
‘which one?’awiya
r-awiya
p-awiya‘who?’
POSS-who
thing-who‘whose?’
‘what?’tiya
titiya‘how much/many?’
‘when?’The interrogatives under (a) formally consist of two morphemes: an interrogative base
-yo or -ye (the choice of interrogative base seems to be lexically rather than phonologically
or morphologically motivated) preceded by an interrogative prefix or a relativiser.
As indicated in the third column above, there are three forms that are translated into
English as ‘where’. The difference between these forms depends firstly on the specificity
of the interrogated location (to- vs. wo-), and secondly on the syntactic function of the
question word (to- and wo- vs. mi-).
The interrogative prefix to- is related to the demonstrative prefix te- ‘area.N’: both refer
to an area, and both can be used as a substantive. Likewise, the interrogative prefix woand the demonstrative prefix we- are related: both refer to ‘general’ locations. A contrast
between to-yo and wo-yo follows:
(242)47n-amo to-yo
2-go
area.N-INT
‘Where are you going?’The form fi-ra is dialectal (from the area to the north of Ayawasi), rendered fi-re in Ayawasi. fi-re is a
marker for manner in adverbial clauses. For a discussion, see §9.2.3.","[121, 122, 123]"
"180Chapter 77.1.3.1 Nominal question words
The question word awiya ‘who’ normally replaces an entire NP. This NP corresponds to
the human subject or object of a clause. Some examples are:
(16)awiya y-per
fra ø-kron
who 3M-step.on {stone ø-sound}
‘Who stepped on the sounding stone?’(17)awiya kerja po, awiya y-kah
ora,
awiya ø-saruk po
au
who work thing who 3M-burn garden who ø-cook thing DIST.U
‘Who works, who makes a garden, and who cooks here?’(18)Yul Yumte m-pet
awiya
Yul Yumte 3U-marry who
‘Who did Yul Yumte marry?’Likewise, p-awiya ‘what’ (lit. ‘thing-who’) can replace an NP. Some examples are:
(19)p-awiya
ø-ptek
thing-who ø-fall
‘What (is it that) fell?’(20)n-asah p-awiya
2-laugh thing-who
‘What are you laughing at?’(21)n-no p-awiya
u
2-do thing-who again
‘What else do you want to do?’When the question is about the nature of a head noun in an NP, the question word
immediately follows that noun. For instance, the answer to example (22) might be fane
rapuoh ro m-api ‘the wild pig that is big’; fane rapuoh ro m-aku ‘the wild pig that is small’
and so on:
(22)fane rapuoh p-awiya
m-hoh fi-t-o
{pig forest} thing-who 3U-run like-near-U
‘What wild pig is running like this?’The question word po p-awiya ‘what thing’, rather than p-awiya ‘what’, is used when
specific information about a thing is requested. Some examples follow:
(23)orie n-no po
p-awiya ti4
now 2-do thing thing-who also
‘What else do you want to do now?’ (lit. ‘what thing do you want to do now?’)The question word po p-awiya can also function as a nominal clause:
(24)4rae
m-he
m-awe po
p-awiya
re-au
person 3U-see 3U-say thing thing-who location.SPEC-DIST.U
‘The people saw it and said: “What is this thing?”’Ti seems to function as a kind of focus adverbial here (see §4.7.6). This form is found in dialects spoken
to the north of Ayawasi.","[197, 198]"

1P-stay dark bird 3U-come
‘We immediately enjoyed this,4 we always stayed and heard the aeroplane.
And then we became acquainted with the radio, formerly we just lived in
the dark.5 We lived in the dark and the aeroplane came.’
A second use of mati is to link an NP or an adverbial and a clause. In this position, the
NP or adverbial then functions as a verbless clause, that is it has the same intonational
characteristics as clauses that occur in this position. Consider, for instance, example (10),
where the NP ana m-ana tuf ‘the three of them’ functions as a verbless clause:
(10)ana m-ana
túf / mati
m-po
tapam tuoh
3P 3U-head three
and.then 3U-hold land place
we-f-ò
location.GEN-very.near-U
‘The three of them, they took (developed) the land in this place.’In this context, the function of mati is to emphasise the previous NP. For example, (11b)
is an informative statement. In contrast with (11b), (11a) was found in a context where
Wuon (the initiation of men) was compared to fnia m-kiar (the ‘education’ of women).6
The question was whether pofit (‘ginger’) played a role in fnia m-kiar. The answer was
negative, after which a comparison with Wuon was given in the form of (11a). The comma
in the translation is given to indicate the emphasis on the word Wuon (as opposed to fnia
m-kiar).

[nu:t]‘we eat’
‘you (P) eat’
‘our shoulder’
‘your (P) shoulder’
‘we climb’
‘you (P) climb’In the forms in (11), the vowel must be phonetically long, while in monosyllabic stems
the vowel is optionally phonetically long. In this way, the following contrasts can be made:
(12)/put/
/po/‘leech’
‘thing’vs.
vs./puut/
/poo/‘we climb’
‘our shoulder’Because the phonetically long vowels in (11) are interpreted phonologically as
sequences of like vowels, and not as phonologically long vowels, the forms in (12) do not
constitute minimal pairs.
Combinations of unlike vowels in which the first vowel is low occur in word-initial
position (13), word-medial position (14), and in word-final position (15):
(13)/ai/

‘I am at’

‘my foot; my sibling (SS)’In the VV-sequences below, a phonetic glide [j] or [w] occurs between the vowels.
Because there are no minimal pairs that warrant a distinction between /VV/ and /VyV/ or
/VwV/, I will assume that this glide is non-phonemic.24 The quality of the glide can be
predicted from the quality of the first vowel in the sequence: if this is a front vowel (/i/ or
/e/), the glide is [j], and if it is a back vowel (/u/ or /o/), the glide is [w]. Examples of wordmedial sequences where [j] is inserted appear in (16), and where [w] is inserted in (18).
Corresponding word-final sequences appear in (17) and (19) respectively.

As stated in §2.1.2, any single consonantal phoneme can occur in word-initial position.
In word-final position any single consonantal phoneme can occur except for /p/, /y/ and
/w/. In monomorphemic forms, sequences of two consonants occur in two positions: (1) in
morpheme-initial position, and (2) in morpheme-medial position on the condition that the
first C in such a CC-cluster is a nasal. In (20) below I have indicated the morpheme-initial
CC-clusters that occur:24An attempt was made to oppose /VV/ and /VyV/ or /VwV/, but the answers given by informants were not
equivocal, and they were not able to give minimal pairs.","[46, 47, 48]"

Manipulating utterances syntactically is a way to make their constituency more
transparent. Among others, Sebba (1987), Foley and van Valin (1984) and Foley and Olson
(1985) demonstrate which tests can be applied to this purpose. In this section, a number of
tests will be applied, namely insertion of an overt coordinator; modification with an
interrogator or an aspectual modifier; and relativisation.3 Of necessity, I employ a large
number of elicited sentences in the section(s) on syntax, because many of the manipulated
versions of utterances rarely occur in natural speech.
8.1.3.1 Insertion of an overt coordinator
Foley and Olson (1985) propose that the question of whether or not constructions
involving sequences of verbs are multi-clausal can be answered by contrasting
constructions with and without an overt coordinator between the two verbs. Often there
will be a contrast in meaning between the two. It is assumed that in a multi-clausal
construction, a coordinator can be inserted between two conjuncts, without effecting a
change in grammaticality or a substantial change in meaning.
In Maybrat, it is possible to insert the coordinator mati ‘and then’ between verbs in
coordinating structures, as demonstrated below:
(17)n-atim mati
t-rof
2-lead and.then 1S-follow
‘You lead and then I follow.’(18)ku
y-awia mati
rae
m-e
biskui
child 3M-cry and.then person 3U-give biscuit
‘The boy cries and then someone gives a biscuit.’The syntactic function of mati here is parallel to that of the pause between two clauses,
as discussed under ‘intonation’ (§8.1.3) above. In examples (5)–(8) above, the pause can
be replaced by mati without rendering the utterances ungrammatical. Semantically, the
sequentiality of the actions, which is already implicit in coordinating constructions, is
made explicit by inserting mati. Note, however, that all other things being equal, the
possibility to insert mati into the sequence of verbs does not entail that the sequence is
3This section draws heavily on conclusions reached in Dol (1996).","[207, 208]"

(243)Chapter 4
m-amo wo-yo
3U-go location.GEN-INT
‘Where does she go?’ (implication: she does not have a clear goal)In other words, the contrast in specificity between to-yo and wo-yo is the same as that
between te-f-o and we-f-o, where in both cases the form with we-/wo- is the generic form.
The words to-yo and wo-yo are normally used to question the locational object of a
verb, as illustrated in (242) and (243): they are used as substantives. To-yo and wo-yo
contrast with mi-yo. The word mi-yo can be used as a substantive, but it can also function
adverbially. Given that some of the other prefixes are derived from the demonstrative
forms, it seems likely on functional grounds that the interrogative prefix mi- is related to
the demonstrative prefix me- ‘PRESTT’, despite the presence of the vowel /i/ rather than /o/
in the prefix. Some examples with mi-yo appear below: in (244) mi-yo functions as a
substantive. In (245) and (246) mi-yo is used adverbially: these are nominal clauses.48
Example (247) illustrates that to-yo cannot function adverbially.
(244)m-apo mi-yo
3U-be PRESTT-INT
‘Where is she?’(245)ku
mi-yo
child PRESTT-INT
‘Where is the child?’(246)mpair ro y-tien
mi-yo
place REL 3M-sleep PRESTT-INT
‘Where is the place where he sleeps?’(247)*n-naif to-yo
2-nose area.N-INTIn other words, the relation between mi-yo on the one hand and to-yo/wo-yo on the other
is the same as that between me-f-o on the one hand and te-f-o/we-f-o on the other: forms
with a prefix me-/mi- function adverbially, while the rest cannot.49 The form ro-yo ‘which
one’ consists of an interrogative base preceded by the relative clause marker ro ‘that’ (see
§4.10.1). The form ro-yo is used in questions where a choice is offered:48
49Here too, it can be argued that mi-yo functions predicatively.
Although I have just stated that the form to-yo cannot function predicatively (i.e. in a nominal clause),
there are a few examples in the data which suggest the opposite:
a. belanga
/ po
to-yo
cooking.pot
thing area.N-INT
‘Cooking pots, from where are these things?’
b. m-o
p-awiya / kan
to-yo
3U-take thing-what charcoal area.N-INT
‘What are they to take (for cooking), where is the charcoal?’
It is unclear why these forms are acceptable while (247) (and many other structurally similar forms) are
not. Clearly, (247) is definitely unacceptable according to informants because it can only be interpreted as
*‘Where has your nose gone off to.’ (i.e. a predicative interpretation), and noses don’t normally run off by
themselves (except maybe in fairy-tales, but I didn’t check that).","[123, 124]"

1S-give money 3U-leaf how.many
‘How many banknotes should I give?’The interrogative ro-yo ‘which one’ (REL-INT) follows the head noun about which more
information is requested. This follows the regular pattern of RCs, in which the head noun
is followed by the RC marker ro and the relativised clause (see §5.3). Some examples are:

The temporal question word titiya ‘when’ invariably occurs in clause-initial position,
which is where the temporal periphery is normally located (see §6.8.1). Examples
involving titiya are given below. In (36) the comma indicates the beginning of a new
clause. In (37), the object po-kuo r-anu re-f-o has been fronted (see §6.4 on objects).

7.1.3.3 Location
The location question words to-yo ‘where’ (area.N-INT), wo-yo ‘where’ (area.GEN-INT)
and mi-yo ‘where’ (PRESTT-INT) occur in clause-final position, like the location periphery.
Some examples involving to-yo are given in (38)–(40). Recall that the location marker tois used to refer to a specific area, that is one that can be pinpointed, as opposed to wo-,
which refers to a more general area. The form mi- is used for presentative forms. The
reader is referred to §4.5 for a more detailed discussion of the differences in meaning
between these three interrogative forms.

Like manner adverbials, the manner interrogative fi-ye occupies the clause-final

of Wuon, i.e. the initiation ritual for men, is discovered by outsiders.

This is possibly a compound form, including -oa ‘not know’. Compare srohni ‘forget’, in which sroh is
‘forget’. Both forms include ni as a final element. The element ha in -oa hani is unattested in the data.
10
The example below is taken from a letter written to me when I was in Ayawasi. The sentence may be a
direct translation from Indonesian, which would account for the fact that fi-ye occurs in clause-initial
position: the corresponding Indonesian bagaimana ‘how’ would also occupy the clause-initial position.

as a manner question word, in which case it is translated as ‘how’:11
(51)m-orie12 t-no wo-yo
3U-now 1S-do LOC.GEN-INT
‘How shall I do it?’7.2 Imperative
The function of the imperative is to give commands or instructions. There are two ways
of forming the imperative. The first type of imperative is marked phonologically: the
speaker used a loud voice in order to give emphasis to the utterance. There are no syntactic
markers. Some examples:
(52)n-ait
2-eat
‘Eat!’(53)n-iit
2-eat.P
‘Eat (plural)!’(54)n-ama amah
2-come house
‘Come to the house!’(55)n-ama ø-srot
2-come ø-quickly
‘Come quickly!’The second type of imperative is characterised by the presence of the focus adverb re in
clause-final position. Imperatives formed with re are milder than the intonationally marked
imperatives discussed above. The difference between the two types of imperative is
illustrated in examples (56) and (52):11This was the only example wo-yo ‘how’: it may be an exception to the rule, although the example was
checked with different people, and invariably translated as indicated.
12
The form m-orie is attested in the data a few times. I assume that it is a predicative form of the temporal
adverb orie ‘later’. Thus, m-orie constitutes a clause, in which m- functions as a person prefix.","[199, 200, 201, 202]"
"Mood
(56)n-ait re
2-eat please
‘Please eat.’(57)n-ama re
2-come please
‘Come, please.’185The form mai ‘PROHIB’ marks the prohibitive, or, in other words, the negative of the
imperative. Like re, mai is placed in clause-final position. Some examples are:
(58)n-aut ara mai
2-climb tree PROHIB
‘Don’t climb into the tree.’(59)n-kias fai
m-api t-o
mai
2-tell woman 3U-big near-U PROHIB
‘Don’t tell this old woman.’8Sequences of verbsSequences of verbal forms (plus their arguments, if any) which together constitute one
sentence occur commonly in Maybrat, as they do indeed in many Papuan languages (see,
for instance Foley 1986:175–176). Superficially many of these sequences look alike. For
instance, morphologically (1) and (2) look similar because each verb carries a person
prefix. However, they are quite different in constituency. Example (1) represents a
coordinating construction, in which each verb constitutes a separate clause. This is
indicated in the translation. In order to coordinate clauses, an overt coordinator, like
English ‘and’ is not needed in Maybrat. Example (1) is formally similar to (2), so there is
nothing that prevents us from interpreting (2) as ‘He speaks and he stabs a cuscus.’
However, syntactically these constructions are quite different: in (2), y-ame kak ‘he kills a
cuscus’ is an object complement of y-awe. Likewise, by analogy to (1), (3) could be
translated as ‘He goes and he towards the sago tree’ although this translation sounds odd.
In (3), y-kit aof functions as the locative object of the verb y-amo.
(1)y-apo y-ata
3M-eat 3M-drink
‘He eats and he drinks.’(2)y-awe y-ame kak
3M-say 3M-stab cuscus
‘He wants to stab a cuscus.’(3)rae
y-amo y-kit
aof
person 3M-go 3M-towards sago.tree
‘The man goes towards the sago tree.’The question, of course, is in what ways one type of verb sequence differs from another,
and what criteria can be used to describe these distinctions. In the present chapter I will
illustrate how with a number of different criteria the syntactic differences between the
sequences like those in examples (1)–(3) can be described. The different types of verb
sequences that can be identified in Maybrat are listed below (including the section where
they are discussed):186Sequences of verbs

comitatives
a problematic categoryThe chapter is set up as follows: In §8.1, I will present a discussion of coordinating
sequences of verbs. They are characterised according to three different types of criteria,
namely intonational (§8.1.1); morphological (§8.1.2); and syntactic (§8.1.3). In the section
on syntax, I will perform three tests that bring out the constituency of these coordinating
verb sequences: insertion of an overt coordinator; examination of the scope of the
interrogative marker a; and relativisation on the object of a clause. Having established the
properties of coordinating sequences of verbs, I will contrast other types of juxtaposed
verbal forms with these coordinating sequences. In §8.2, I discuss what will be referred to
as adverbial verbs, that is sequences that include a verb which functions as a modifier to a
main verb. Section 8.3 concentrates on sequences in which the second verb (and its
arguments or modifiers) functions as an object complement of the first verb. In these
sequences, the first verb may be a perception verb; a mental activity verb; the causative
verb -no ‘do’; or the verb -awe ‘say’. Section 8.4 discusses prepositional verbs. I will show
that some prepositional verbs have more ‘verbal’ properties than others. The latter behave
more like prepositions. In §8.5, I will describe some syntactic properties of comitative
constructions.
Having used relativisation as a syntactic test for the constituency of sequences of verbs
in this chapter, in §8.6 I will summarise some properties of the relativisability of arguments
in different syntactic types of constructions. I will relate these facts to Keenan and
Comrie’s ‘Accessibility Hierarchy’. Finally, in §8.7, I will present some types of verb
sequences that share properties with both the coordinating constructions discussed in §8.1,
and the constructions involving an object complement. These constructions resemble
constructions that are labelled ‘serial verb constructions’ (SVCs) in the literature.
In the remainder of this chapter, if I refer to ‘verb’, it is implied that this includes a
verbal form plus its arguments, unless otherwise stated. I realise that strictly speaking,
‘verb’ refers to a morphological entity, whereas in this section the functional
characteristics, or the constituency of the verbal forms, are discussed. However, using the
term ‘clause’ for these entities is misleading, since it will appear that some verbal forms
are not clausal. Therefore, ‘verb’ is chosen as a neutral umbrella term.
8.1 Coordination
A coordinating construction can be defined as a construction involving a sequence of
syntactic units, all of the same syntactic category and rank (Zwicky 1990:4). The elements
in these sequences can be either juxtaposed or overtly coordinated (Dik 1997:196). The
problem in Maybrat, as illustrated in examples (1)–(3), is the absence of overt coordinators
in sequences which formally (that is categorially) contain verbs, but functionally (that is
with respect to syntactic rank) may or may not constitute clauses. The question thus is,
which criteria can be used to illustrate that each verb in a sequence syntactically functions
as a clause.","[202, 203, 204, 205]"
"Morphophonology53In (13) I give stems which phonetically contain three syllabic Vs. As in the bisyllabic
stems in (10)–(12), the person prefix is never phonologically expressed.

‘I deceive’In Maybrat, any form consisting of an overtly prefixed verb can function as a clause,
that is as a constituent consisting minimally of a predicate (the morphological verb) and its
arguments (its person prefix) (see Chapter 6, Introduction, and §6.2). Verbal forms with a
phonologically repressed person prefix can function as a clause just like forms with a
phonologically expressed person prefix. Any form without a phonologically expressed
person prefix can also function as a clause. For the sake of consistence, I assume that those
forms with and those without a phonologically expressed person prefix are structurally
similar. Therefore, I introduce a zero prefix ‘ø-’ to represent the phonologically repressed
person prefix in these forms.
I do realise that the introduction of a ‘zero-morpheme’ may seem redundant, since its
occurrence is restricted to two word classes, namely the class of verbs (§4.2) and the class
of inalienably possessed nouns (§4.3.1). Often, the word class that a form belongs to is
clear from its syntactic behaviour, and, given the morphophonological description here, the
absence of an overt person prefix on these forms can be predicted. However, I have chosen
to mark covert person prefixes throughout this work for two reasons: firstly, and crucially,
there are a number of forms where the presence versus the absence of a person prefix plays
a role: for example, number phrases are headed by a prefixless inalienably possessed
pronoun. Addition of a person prefix could render a different meaning (see §5.1.4). In
adverbial verbs the presence versus the absence of a person prefix is also crucial to the
meaning of an utterance (§8.2). The only way to adequately describe these forms is by
introducing a zero-morpheme, which can, just like overt morphemes, be omitted in the
description where this is required. Secondly, typologically, in many languages the
description of sequences of verbs (or serial verb constructions) hinges on the presence
versus the absence of inflection on the verbs. In my view, the description of sequences of
verbs in Maybrat (Chapter 8) is unambiguous by marking all the inflections, be they overt
or covert. This prevents misinterpretations about the syntactic behaviour of the verbs in
these sequences.
3.1.3 Some exceptions
So far, the analysis of the constraints on the phonological expression of person prefixes
in terms of the CV-syllable structure has been straightforward: forms with monosyllabic
stems, and forms with V-initial stems take overt person prefixes. C-initial forms with
bisyllabic stems take covert person prefixes, unless the second syllable in the stem is Vinitial, or the stem contains a VV-sequence where one V is a (reducible) /i/ or /u/ (see also
§2.6). C-initial stems with two or more syllables take covert person prefixes. There are two
categories of forms, however, that do not seem open to such a straightforward solution. To54Chapter 3begin with, the forms in (14) are bisyllabic, and the second syllable of the stem is V-initial.
By analogy to those forms in (7) and (9) which have /i/ or /u/ in their first syllable, the
forms in (14) would be expected to receive an overt person prefix. However, prefixed
forms are rejected, as indicated in the last column in the examples below:
(14)/kiam/
/fia/
/yuo/[»kijAm]
[»fija]
[»juwo]CV|VC
CV|V
CV|V‘I am ill’
‘I swallow’
‘I flee’*[m-»kijAm]
*[m-»fija]
*[m-»juwo]It seems to be the case that CV-structure alone cannot account for all the forms, and that
in some cases stress also plays a role. Recall, that in Maybrat, stress is lightly phonemic. In
many cases it can be predicted, but in the forms in (14), stress falls on the first syllable, and
/i/ or /u/ in this syllable cannot be reduced. The resulting verb has two syllables, and will
not allow a person prefix because this would add an extra syllable to the form, resulting in
an illicit tri-syllabic form.2
A second group of forms that do not tally with the observation that monosyllabic stems
can take an overt person prefix is given in (15). These forms, despite the fact that they
constitute monosyllabic stems, never take overt person prefixes. I propose that these forms
are marked lexically as exceptions to the rule of person prefixing.3
23An alternative solution is as follows: if on a morphophonological level it is assumed that the glides [y]
and [w] between the vowels in (14) are not epenthetic, but phonologically present, i.e. /y/ and /w/, then
the stems of the forms in (14) can be represented as in (a) below. This yields forms in which the second
syllable of the stem is C-initial, i.e. forms that are analogous to those in (10), (11) and (12):
(a) /kiyam/
[»kijAm]
CV|CVC
‘I am ill’
/fiya/
[»fija]
CV|CV
‘I swallow’
/yuwo/
[»juwo]
CV|CV
‘I flee’
The difference in morphological behaviour between all these forms could then be explained in terms
of CV-structure, just like the other forms. However, there are no minimal pairs to warrant a distinction
between the presence versus the absence of the glides /y/ and /w/ in this position. As such, the distinction
would have to be described on a morphophonological level.
Obviously this morphophonological criterion does not work for forms that never take a person
prefix. For example, nouns that have a /VyV/ sequence or a /VwV/ sequences may be transcribed
morphophonologically as either :VyV: / :VwV: or as :VV:, as illustrated in (b):

There is one way to explain the odd behaviour of the forms in (15), namely that they are a relic of what
was once a distinction in length. Throughout the collection of data, informants kept insisting on audible
differences between certain homophones, for instance between the forms given in Chapter 2, footnote 20
([»nasçm] ‘You carry, your name is’; [»maru] ‘She cuts, lake’; [»ana] ‘they, fence’ and [»moo] ‘She takes,
She itches’; and [m´»tAx] ‘dog, It is bitter’ etc.). The strategies to find this difference were as follows: (1)
Recordings were made of the words both in isolation and in context. In these recordings no differences
were found after thorough analysis with the speech program GIPOS (Graphical Interactive Processing of
Speech, see also Chapter 2, footnote 34); (2) The recordings mentioned in (1) were manipulated,
whereby: (a) the vowels in the forms were lengthened/shortened, and the pitch at which they were uttered
was changed; and (b) putative minimal forms uttered in a context were interchanged. The results of these
manipulations were offered to informants, but no clear indications for the existence for minimal pairs wasMorphophonology

The formation of question words suggests the presence of a morphophonological glide
between two vowels. Question words are formed by adding an interrogative particle -yo or
-ye to a demonstrative base.4 Some examples (forms between ‘: :’ are morphophonological
representations):
(16)/to-yo/
/wo-yo/:to-yo:
:wo-yo:‘where’ (SPEC)
‘where’ (GEN)Two other forms, including the morphophonological representations, appear below:
(17)/fi-ye/
/mi-yo/:fi-ye:
:mi-yo:‘how’
‘where’ (ADV)Theoretically, the morphophonological forms in (17) could be *:fie: and *:mio:, as these
could underlie the same phonetic forms as those given above, that is [»fije] and [»mijo]
respectively. However, it is clear from the forms in (16) that the interrogative suffix is
:y:-initial. By analogy, I conclude that the suffixes in the forms in (17) are also :y:-initial,
in other words, that the glide in these forms is morphophonologically present.
3.3 /a/-initial stems
Maybrat verbs and inalienably possessed nouns (including kinship terms) of which the
stem begins with /a/, lack this /a/ in the first and second person plural forms (but not in the
third person unmarked). In other words, there is an alternation between first and second
person plural stems and the rest. If the first and second person plural stems are
C-initial, the CC-sequence resulting after prefixation with a phonologically expressed
person prefix is broken up by an epenthetic schwa.","[70, 71, 72, 73]"

have a clear relation to the rest of the sentence, and it is surrounded by intonational pauses.
However, due to its semantic content, it is discussed in §4.7.5 on negators, and in §6.9.5
under the heading ‘other semantic negatives’.
One particle, glossed ‘PART’, has been defined, namely the element -re in wo-re and
fi-re. Wo-re is a locative adverbial clause marker, while fi-re is a manner adverbial clause
marker. The function and meaning of -re are unclear. An example is:
(366)m-hu wo-re
rae ø-skie spiah
3U-stay location.GEN-PART man ø-build hut
‘They stay where the people built a hut.’For a discussion on locative and manner adverbial clauses, see §9.2.2 and §9.2.3
respectively.","[143, 144]"
"The clause1516.8 Adverbials
The function of adverbials in the clause is to modify or specify an event expressed by
the predicate (see §4.7). Adverbials occur in the ‘periphery’ of the clause. In Maybrat
peripheral constituents can be syntactically defined as ‘any constituent which is not a head
or a subject or object argument’. Peripheral constituents are constituents that specify the
spatial or temporal setting of an event (cf. Foley & Olson 1985:36).
In the discussion of the periphery, I will make a distinction between different types of
adverbials, based on syntactic and semantic criteria. The section will begin with the
periphery that precedes the predicate in a clause, that is the temporal periphery (§6.8.1).
Subsequently, the peripheries that occur in clause-final position are described, namely the
manner (§6.8.2), aspect (§6.8.3), and focus (§6.8.4) periphery. Apart from the adverbs
introduced in §4.7, these peripheries can also include items that formally belong to other
word classes, but can function as adverbials. In §6.8.6 I will discuss the location periphery.
Negation is described in §6.9. Clausal determiners and anaphoric reference are treated in
§6.10 and §6.11 respectively.
6.8.1 Time
In the temporal periphery, the question of ‘when’ the action described in the clause took
place or will take place is answered. The temporal periphery precedes s-V in a clause, as
illustrated in example (43). If the subject of a clause is also expressed by a full NP, then the
temporal adverbial may either precede this subject, or follow it, as illustrated in (44). The
difference in meaning between these two forms is, according to informants, negligible. The
scope of the temporal adverbial is the entire clause that follows.
(43)is
y-pat
Konya y-ama

‘Yesterday he came from Konya.’(44) a.pi

‘The man hid there just now.’b.ira
pi
ait y-apum au
just.now man 3M 3M-hide U.DIST
‘Just now the man hid there.’Temporal adverbs can be combined, in order to make time reference more specific. The
mutual ordering of the two time adverbs does not seem to be crucial, given the examples in
(47) and (48): in (47) the temporal adverbial is tian pose, while in (48) it is pose tian.

clause. In addition, there are a number of numerals and demonstratives which can function
as temporal adverbials.
Many languages have temporal deictic forms which are derived from, or based on,
spatial demonstratives (Anderson & Keenan 1985:297–300; Heine et al. 1991:31). In
Maybrat the demonstrative me-f-o can function as a temporal adverbial.10 Some examples
are:
(49)me-f-ot-ait
po-iit
PRESTT-very.near-U 1S-eat NOM-eat.P
‘Now I’m eating food.’(50)Mafif y-awe, me-f-o

ø-farkor m-ae Jayapura
Agus PRESTT-very.near-U ø-study 3U-at Jayapura
‘Agus is studying at Jayapura now.’Likewise, the directional tis ‘behind’ and the complex directional to-tis ‘LOC-behind’
can occur in the temporal periphery of a clause. In this function, tis is adequately translated
as ‘finally’, and to-tis as ‘in the end’. Both notionally refer to time:
(52)m-nan
tis
m-nies
ro y-api t-a
ø-sruer

LOC-behind 3m 3m-do thing 3u-good
‘In the end he does well.’ (lit. ‘In the end he does good things.’)Below, an example of a nominal clause modified by to-tis is given:
(54)10to-tis
y-ana
s-ait

LOC-behind 3M-head one-3M child male
‘The last one is a boy.’I noted one instance of the demonstrative we-f-o functioning as a temporal adverbial:

apan potafit
sawiah m-apuf
location.GEN-very.near-U 1P 1P-see {snake potafit} ø-tail 3U-short
‘Now we see that the potafit snake has a short tail.’The clause153Some NPs that notionally refer to time, such as snie ‘month’ or tein ‘year’ can function
as temporal adverbials. These NPs can be modified by a numeral (55)–(57), and, if the
head is snie ‘month’, by the name of the month (58):
(55)snie
tuf
Fince m-ape

‘In three months Fince will give birth.’(56)tein s-au

‘In two months it will rain again.’(58)snie
Maret ana ø-skie amah m-arak
month March 3P ø-build house 3U-empty
‘In March they will finish building the house.’The expression um sau, as in (59), is an idiomatic expression, used to introduce a new
story. It is adequately translated as ‘once upon a time’.
(59)um

‘Once upon a time the two stand and burn a garden.’(60)um
s-au
arin
mti oh …
moment one-3U situation night already
‘Once upon a time, it is already night …’As already illustrated in §4.7.1, numerals can also be used as time adverbials. In
practice, only the numerals from ‘three’ to ‘six’ are used in this function. To refer to a time
span larger than six days, the Indonesian term Hari Minggu ‘Sunday’ is used. ‘Sundays’
can be modified by a numeral to refer to the number of weeks. Some examples are:
(61)Hari Minggu s-au
amu p-mo ø-twok sembahyang’
{Sunday}

‘On one (a particular) Sunday, we go and enter and pray.’(62)Hari Minggu tuf t-amo Negeri Belanda

three 1S-go {The Netherlands} again
‘After three Sundays I will go to The Netherlands again.’In example (63) the nominal clause waro fi-f-o ‘a little while, like this’, places the
action described in the clause in time. In other words, waro fi-f-o functions like a temporal
adverbial.

In the manner periphery, questions about ‘the way in which’ or ‘how’ an event takes
place are answered. Manner adverbials occur in clause-final position, and their scope is the
entire clause they modify. Some examples follow:
(64)anu n-no
iso f-o
kaket
2P 2-make road very.near-U well
‘You build this road well.’(65)ait y-awia toro
3M 3M-cry many.times
‘He cries many times.’(66)rae

m-atak
mimo
person police long.time.ago 3U-angry very
‘A long time ago, the policemen were very angry.’(67)n-amo rere
2-go
carefully
‘Go carefully.’In the examples above, the manner periphery is filled by manner adverbs, introduced in
§4.7.2. The occurrence of manner adverbs is restricted to the manner periphery of a clause.
The manner periphery can also be filled by forms that function as manner adverbials,
but formally belong to other word classes. The reason for analysing these forms as manner
adverbials is twofold: firstly, like the other manner adverbs, they occur in clause-final
position, thus taking the same syntactic position as manner adverbs. Secondly, they
stipulate how the action referred to in the clause is carried out, in other words, they have
the same semantic content as manner adverbials. A distinction can be made between two
types of ‘functional manner adverbials’, namely non-verbal forms and verbal forms. The
non-verbal forms are listed in (68). With the exception of rere, all are morphologically
complex.
(68)rere ‘carefully’
– demonstrative forms prefixed with fi- (see §4.4.2)
– emphatic pronouns, that is pronouns prefixed with po- (see §4.1.3)Rere, when it occurs in clause-initial position, functions as a temporal adverbial
meaning ‘shortly’, as illustrated in (69) (see §4.7.1). In clause-final position rere functions
as a manner adverbial meaning ‘carefully’, as in (70) and (71):
(69)rere
p-mo p-te
aya
shortly 1P-go.P 1P-bathe.P water
‘Shortly we will go and bathe.’(70)au m-wian

rere
3U 3U-scoop water carefully
‘She scoops water carefully.’11Pris is a loan from Du politie ‘police’ (see §2.8).","[168, 169, 170, 171, 172]"
"Sequences of verbs195I conclude that the example in (27b) is an exception to the rule that an object cannot
come between a prefixed verb and a following bare-stem verb. The position of these barestem verbs emphasises their adverbial character: many adverbs occur in clause-final
position, as was shown in §4.7 and §6.8.
The second type of adverbial, the verbal form -o, expresses modality when occurring as
a first verb in a series. It is often translated into Indonesian as betul-betul ‘right, very,
truly’. In this function -o has lost its semantic content of ‘take’, but is still related to it, as
indicated in the glosses. The corresponding b-varieties, given for the sake of contrast, do
not contain the verb -o.

‘She arrives at Ayawasi.’Sequences with ‘-o+V’ are similar to the ‘V+bare-stem’ forms discussed above: -o
never functions as a single verb with a modal interpretation, these sequences are unattested
with an intonation break or mati between the ‘-o’ and the ‘V’, and when changing the
‘-o+V’ constructions into polar questions, the scope of the interrogative marker is over
both ‘-o+V’, as illustrated in (37).9
(37)pi
ait y-o
ø-tetet à /
man 3M 3M-take ø-happy INT
‘Is the man really happy?’The only formal difference is that both forms in ‘-o+V’ and ‘V+bare-stem’ is that in the
former the -o takes a person prefix, whereas ‘bare-stem’ verb does not.
Semantically, -o behaves like an adverbial, although syntactically it is different from
many other adverbials in that it precedes rather than follows the main verb. Like
constructions involving bare-stem verbs, sequences with a ‘modal’ -o constitute one single
clause according to the criteria set at the beginning of this chapter.","[212, 213]"

9.3 The functions of p-awiya
The question word p-awiya ‘what’, introduced in §4.5, can function as an interrogative.
An example (see also §7.1.3):
(82)ait y-awe p-awiya
3M 3M-say thing-INT
‘What does he say?’The question word p-awiya also has three other functions. Firstly, p-awiya can function
as an adverbial clause marker. In this role, p-awiya always introduces a locative adverbial
clause. The syntactic position of p-awiya is the same as that of the locative adverbial clause
markers wo, wo-re and wo-yo, that is it occurs in clause-initial position. Although it is
typologically consistent that an interrogative form functions as an adverbial clause marker
(see §9.2) it seems odd that a form that questions a noun can refer to a location. However,
given that adverbial clauses have a high nominal profile, the use of p-awiya ‘what’ in this
context is actually quite regular. Some examples including p-awiya:
(83)ora
tein
fene
m-kah p-awiya amah

‘They of the place above with the people of the place below(?) stood
where the place of the hanger is.’21It is unclear whether this refers to the name of a place, i.e. Tuoh Mate, or whether mate means ‘below’,
and is possibly related to the ete ‘below’. If it is related to ete, then this may say something about the
former verbal character of ete.","[256, 257]"

‘whose hand/arm?’(31)awiya m-aim

‘whose wing?’Interrogative forms involving inalienably possessed nouns referring to attributes of
plants, that is leaves, roots and so on are unattested in the data.6
The question word tiya7 ‘how much/many’ follows the classifier in the NP, according to
the regular position of the numeral in the NP (see §5.1.4):

‘Agus’’
‘Eka’s’3.5 Reduplication
The function of reduplication is to intensify the meaning of a word, usually a verb, and
sometimes an adverb. The resulting form semantically contains an element of
‘randomness’. Formally, if the reduplicated word is a verb, then only the verb stem is
copied, as illustrated in (26). If the stem of a form is monosyllabic, then the person prefix
appears on the first member of the reduplicated form, and an epenthetic schwa is inserted
between the two members to avoid a stress clash. This is illustrated in (26).
If there are more than two syllables in a form after reduplication, then the main stress
falls where the main stress of the second (that is reduplicated) member falls. The secondary
stress is where the main stress of the first member falls. In other words, the stress pattern is
similar to that of compound nouns (see §2.4.1).
(26):m-fit-fit:[m´-«fit´»fit]
‘they yank out a lot’
< :m-fit: ‘they yank out’:m-fok-fok:[m´-«fçk´»fçk] ‘they roll’
< :m-fok: ‘they fall spontaneously’:m-nax-nax:[m´-«nAx´»nAx] ‘they move randomly’
< :nax: ‘it moves’58Chapter 3If after reduplication the resulting form consists of less than four syllables, the main
stress is on the first full syllable of the word, as illustrated in :xrer-er: below:
(27):kro-kro:[k´«ro-k´»ro]
‘they follow constantly’
<:kro: ‘they follow’:xrer-er:[x´»rErEr]‘it makes a prolonged smooth sound’6
< :xrer: ‘it makes a smooth sound’In some forms, the vowel in the reduplicated member changes to :a: as illustrated
below:
(28):m-sun-san:[m´-«sun-´»sAn] ‘it makes lots of noise’
< :m-sun: ‘it makes noise’ (e.g. running water):frit-frat:[f´«rit-f´»rAt]
‘they are busy’
< :frit: ‘they move’:frok-frak:[f´«rçk-f´»rAk] ‘everyone emerges’
< :frok: ‘they emerge’:frur-frar:[f´«rur-f´»rAr]
‘they are stretched all over the place’
< :frur: ‘they stretch out’:krox-krax:[k´«rçx-k´»rAx] ‘they make a long loud noise’
< :krox: ‘they make a loud noise’:ptok-ptak:[p´«tçk-p´»tAk] ‘randomly’
< :ptok: ‘immediately’:rpi-rpa:[r´«pi-r´»pa]:surut-surat:[«surut-»surAt]
‘it is completely broken’
< :surut: ‘it is broken’:nini-nina:[«nini-»nina]‘tapping (noise of rain on roof)’
< *:rpi: (unattested in the data)‘pitchdark, ignorant (figuratively)’
< :nini: ‘pitchdark’3.6 Orthographic conventions
Based on the observations made in Chapter 2, and some of the conclusions drawn in this
chapter, I will adopt the following orthographic conventions for the remainder of this
work:6In this form, only part of the stem seems to be copied, i.e. *[x´«rerx´»rer].","[74, 75, 76]"

The different types of adverbials discussed in §6.8.2–§6.8.4, that is the adverbials that
predominantly occur in clause-final position, can also be combined. If adverbials are
combined, then the scope of the adverbial that occupies the clause-final position is over the
entire clause, including the other adverbial. The scope of the pre-final adverbial does not
include the final adverbial. A contrast is given in the following example (141):

‘He carefully does it again.’b.ait y-no

aspect-focus:

3U 3U-come new still too
‘She also came very recently.’ (lit. ‘She came, it is still recent too.’)

manner-focus:

‘The house is also very big.’
6.8.6 Location
In the location periphery, the question of ‘where’ or ‘in what direction’ an event takes
place is answered. The location periphery occurs in clause-final position.
In §4.8, I discussed forms that refer to location. These items can occupy the location
periphery in the clause, in which case they function as location adverbials. Others, for
instance nouns that refer to a location, function as nominal objects in the clause. An
example is given in (147) and (148). While the verbs in these clauses are the same, the
objects are different. In (147), the object is nominal. This can be illustrated by extracting
the object, as in (147b): extraction of the object in a single-verb clause is always possible if
the object is nominal (see §6.7). Example (148) is modified by a locative adverb kait
‘near’. Kait cannot be extracted, as illustrated in (148b), because it does not function as a
nominal constituent, but as an adverbial one.

In Mayhapeh and Karon, there seem to be some differences in the use of person
prefixes: some Karon forms have prefixes where Mayhapeh cognates do not and vice
versa. Compare, for instance, Mayhapeh m-hai <3U-die> with Karon hai ‘They die’. In
Mayhapeh, *hai is an unacceptable form. Similarly in Mayhapeh the inalienably possessed
noun -haf ‘stomach’ always takes a subject prefix (t-haf ‘my stomach’, n-haf ‘your
stomach’ and so on), while Karon haf ‘stomach’ is acceptable. The initial consonant in a
number of Karon forms is homophonous with the third person masculine prefix y-, for
example yauf ‘egg’ (Mayhapeh m-auf); yru ‘They fly’ (<ru ‘bird’) (Mayhapeh fru ‘They
fly’). Some Karon forms noted by Voorhoeve show differences along the same lines, for
example Karon aru yawian vs. Mayhapeh ru mawian ‘bird feathers’ (Voorhoeve pers.
comm., based on fieldnotes).
1.8 Fieldwork
The reason for selecting Ayawasi as a site for fieldwork was threefold. Firstly, Ayawasi,
with its large and almost completely bilingual community, is a good place to collect
language data. Secondly, some anthropological fieldwork had already been conducted in
Ayawasi, resulting in an ethnography (Schoorl 1979, see also §1.5). Thirdly, from a
practical point of view, the people at the missionary post were willing to assist at the
beginning of the fieldwork period, and, Ayawasi has an airstrip providing some access to
the township of Sorong. Because I found many good informants in Ayawasi, I decided to
collect the bulk of my data there.
Fieldwork was conducted in two periods, from September 1993 to February 1995 and
from October 1995 to March 1996. Initially Indonesian was used as the contact language.
A start was made with acquiring a basic knowledge of Maybrat in the form of words,
greetings, short questions that could be asked in the village, and short sentences.
Subsequently, a word list of 700 lexical items was recorded, as well as three short stories.
A number of people were asked to help transcribe and translate the texts. In the meantime,
I acquired enough oral proficiency to conduct conversations.
After having formulated preliminary hypotheses about the phonology, morphology and
syntax of the language, more texts were recorded, transcribed, and translated with the help
of several people. These texts were analysed and any queries were discussed with12Chapter 1informants. The texts were used as the basis for the elicitation of new material:
constructions or features that were not understood, or that required more data, were
elaborated on with informants. Some of this elicitation was done by constructing sentences,
and asking a native speaker to improve them.
Most of the data were entered into two computer databases: for the analysis of the
phonological data the programme ‘FindPhone’ was used and for interlinearising texts the
programme ‘Shoebox’.28 The initial phonological analysis was based on 900 forms in the
database, and was later supplemented by more material. The Shoebox programme
contained over 2700 types of words. Eventually the recorded and written text material
totalled over 45.000 tokens (approximately sixty typed pages).
In addition to the material entered into the digital databases, a concordance was made
by hand, based on the collected texts. This concordance included examples of different
sentence types, instances of lexical items that were not yet fully understood, instances of
the use of different types of words in natural text, for example demonstratives, question
words and so on. The concordance proved practical in elicitation with informants, because
all the information in a particular field, plus the source of that information, was easily
accessible. For instance, when the function and occurrence of a particular deictic element
had to be analysed, examples were taken from the concordance. These examples could
then be used as a basis for further elicitation.
Towards the end of my stay in Ayawasi, much of the elicitation as well as the
transcriptions were done monolingually. This, and conversations conducted and overheard
in the village, proved a valuable source of new data.
The data on which this grammar is based comprises the following material:
stories and myths
These stories include traditional tales, incorporating trickster stories, myths, fables,
children’s stories, speeches (made in Church), travel accounts, conversations, explanations,
historical narratives, and family histories. Some of this material was recorded by others, for
example Han Schoorl and Wanda Avé, and given to me to work out.
written material
When people in Ayawasi realised that I recorded stories and subsequently transcribed
them, they occasionally brought in written material. This material included explanations,
such as how to grow sago; how to hunt and cut up a pig; a number of letters to me
(including an e-mail!); a traditional tale; a list of names of snakes; a list of names of plants;
and a farewell speech written by two villagers and said in church by a parting Brother.
conversations
Some material was recorded, and other material was noted down while talking to
villagers, or when overheard.
elicited material
The elicited material includes lists of words and short sentences recorded at the
beginning of the fieldwork as well as self-constructed sentences and contrasting pairs made
while working with informants.
28Both of these databases were developed by members of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL).","[28, 29, 30]"
"Simon y-amo Kumurkek iye fe
Simon 3M-go Kumurkek also NEG
‘He does not also go to Kumurkek.’The order iye fe, as in example (185b), is highly marked; the most frequent order for the
negator fe and the adverbial iye is that in (185a). This is surprising, since usually the
negator occurs clause-finally. This suggests that the combination fe iye is idiomatic. Some
more examples are:
(186)m-amo ninan

‘They also do not go randomly.’(187)n-he fe

idiomatic expression fe fares ‘not yet’.31 Some examples follow:

Nella 3U-go NEG still
‘Nella has not gone yet.’(190)m-e
pitis

fares
3U-give money NEG still
‘She has not given money yet.’When there are other adverbials in the clause, that is kaket in (191), fe fares normally
follows those adverbs:
(191)ø-kiyam m-arak
kaket fe
fares
ø-ill
3U-empty well NEG still
‘My illness is not yet finished well.’ (lit. ‘I am ill, it is not yet finished well.’)In sentence-initial position, the predicative m-fe can be followed by the manner adverb
fi-t-o to form the expression m-fe fi-t-o. This expression stipulates that there is a choice: if
the clause preceding m-fe fi-t-o does not apply, then the following clause applies. M-fe
fi-t-o can be adequately translated as ‘or alternatively’. Some examples follow:
(192)y-fais m-ae pron, m-fe

‘A dog bites (the prey), or alternatively, a man stabs (it).’The forms fe and m-fe can also function as disjunctive coordinators. They are discussed
in §9.1.3. Disjunctive coordination is also used in alternative questions, which are
discussed in §7.1.
31The sequence fares fe is unattested in the texts, but it is theoretically possible, as illustrated below:
a. ku
m-ait po-iit

b. ku
m-ait po-iit
fares fe
child 3U-eat thing-eat.P NEG still
child 3U-eat thing-eat.P still NEG
‘The child has not eaten yet.’
‘The child is not still eating.’
Although a form like b. above can be given an interpretation, it is a very ‘tortured’ sentence. A more
natural way to express that a child is no longer eating is given below:
c. ku
m-ait po-iit
oh
child 3U-eat thing-eat.P already
‘The child has already eaten.’

"208Chapter 8Semantically, the two differ slightly: in example (102a) the verb -ae is adequately
translated as ‘to be at’, as indicated in the English translation. In (102b) m-ae has little
semantic content: its function is that of a pointer which marks the following NP as a
location. The difference between these two kinds of -ae has consequences for its
intonational and syntactic behaviour: a sequence of a verb followed by m-ae cannot be
dominated by two intonation contours without rendering the utterance ungrammatical,13 as
illustrated in (103). The same applies to insertion of the overt coordinator mati, as in (104).

‘declining’ forms are similar to coordinating constructions, the defective paradigm
instances are different. I will return to the notion that a lexical item, like this defectiveparadigm verb -ae, is formally like a verb, but is functionally more like a preposition in the
following section.
8.4.1 Another note on ‘prepositions’
In §4.2.3.5 I showed that with the exception of -ae, the prepositional verbs cannot
function as main verbs in a clause although two of them, -kit and -pat, do take person
prefixes like regular verbs. In §8.4 I illustrated that, when placed in a sequence with other
verbs, the resulting sequences behave differently from coordinating sequences of verbs.
13Unless there is a rise in pitch on the first verb followed by a pause, in which case m-ae hanggar would be
emphasised, see (87)–(90).
14
It may seem odd that the b-form below is acceptable, as opposed to (105b) and (106b) which are not. A
possible explanation is that in the example below m-ae Ayawasi is interpreted as a separate clause, where
m-ae functions as a main verb:
a. ana m-amo m-ae Ayawasi
b. [[Ayawasi ro
m-amo Ø]] m-ae kait Ayata
3P 3U-go 3U-at Ayawasi
Ayawasi REL 3U-go
3U-at near Ayata
‘They go to Ayawasi.’
‘Ayawasi, that they go to, is near Ayata.’Sequences of verbs209Prepositional verbs seem to be less ‘verby’ than other verbs, with m-kah as the most
remarkable form, since its verbal character is debatable to begin with (see §4.2.3.5 for the
arguments to classify it as a verb).
Prepositional notions that are expressed by forms which are verbal in character to a
greater or lesser extent are found in many (serialising) languages. Lord (1973) finds that in
a number of Kwa languages, spoken in West Africa, some prepositions evolved from
locative verbs in a serial construction. Hamel (1993), in her description of Loniu, an
Oceanic language, finds that oblique roles such as locatives, causatives and instrument/
manner constructions are expressed by prepositions that are derived from verbs, but have
lost some of their verbal properties. Schachter (1974:265) states that verbs that occur in
serial verb constructions often lose their verbal characteristics resulting in a
‘reinterpretation as prepositions’. Disregarding for the moment the question of whether the
verb sequences described in the present section qualify as ‘serial verb constructions’ (I will
return to this in §8.7 and §8.8), the behaviour of Maybrat prepositional verbs is, from a
typological point of view, not unusual.
The question is whether these verbs should be analysed as prepositions or as verbs. Lord
(1993) gives a number of criteria that have to be met for a verbal form to qualify as a
preposition (Lord 1993:14). These criteria refer to the extent to which such verbal forms
are verbal in behaviour. In Maybrat, -ae can function as a main verb, whereas -kit, -pat and
-kah cannot. However, Lord states that objects of verbs can be extracted, whereas those of
prepositions cannot. According to this criterion then, -kit and -pat are more ‘verbal’ than
-ae and -kah, as the former two verbs allow relativisation of their objects more easily than
the latter two verbs. Likewise, -kit and -pat are more verbal than -ae and -kah because of
their ability to select nouns as subjects: as was illustrated above, -ae is sometimes, and
-kah is always a ‘defective paradigm’ verb. The ability to select a noun as a subject, which
with the exception of -kah all verbs clearly can do, is another property associated with
verbs, according to Lord.
It is clear that the ‘prepositional’ verbs in Maybrat are not exclusively prepositions, but
at the same time, they are not exclusively verbs, as they do not fully exhibit some of the
properties that are so typical of ‘real’ Maybrat verbs, such as the ability to function as a
main verb and the ability to take person prefixes.
8.5 Comitatives
The comitative verb -sia was introduced in §4.2.3.6. There, I stated that -sia takes both
a subject and an object, and that it cannot function as a main verb. In this section, I will
discuss the syntactic behaviour of comitative constructions.
Formally, -sia is a verb which takes two arguments. The person prefix of -sia must be
coreferent with the subject of the verb. The forms below are NPs: they cannot function as
predicates.
(107)tuo t-sia
fnia
1S 1S-with woman
‘I with the woman’(108)ait y-sia
y-ano
3M 3M-with 3M-sibling.OS
‘he with his sister’210Chapter 8In example (109a) tuo t-sia ait functions as the subject of a clause. The main verb -amo
‘go’ takes a first person singular person prefix t-. Conversely, in (109b), the main verb
takes a plural person prefix p- whilst in (110), there is also subject agreement. In this
example, the comitative is considered part of the subject, hence the plural case marking.
This type of comitative is more common in Papuan languages (see Reesink 1987:85).
(109) a.b.","[225, 226, 227, 228]"
"4Word classesIn the present chapter, Maybrat words are assigned to different word classes. I will
define word classes on the basis of two grammatical criteria, namely morphological and
syntactic (cf. Schachter 1985:3).
A word is the smallest unit of a sentence which has positional mobility (Cruse 1986:35)
and which cannot be interrupted by a pause (Lyons 1968:202). According to these criteria,
amah ‘house’ and fane ‘pig’ are words: they have positional mobility in the sentence and
they cannot be interrupted by a pause. By the same criteria, t-kias ‘I tell’ and re-f-o ‘this
very.near’ are words, albeit morphologically complex ones: they each consist of more than
one morpheme.
In Maybrat, the following thirteen word classes can be defined:
pronouns (person deixis)
verbs
nouns
demonstratives
question words
numerals
adverbs
location markers
directionals
coordinators
subordinate clause markers
enumerators
interjections
Person deixis is the first item to be discussed (§4.1). The reason for this early
presentation is that it can then be referred to in the subsequent discussion of the largest
(open) classes, that is those of verbs (§4.2) and nouns (§4.3). In the presentation of verbs,
the morphological properties are discussed in §4.2, and from §4.2.1 onwards the different
classes of verbs are discussed. At the end of §4.2, I will describe derivation. Section 4.3, on
nouns, begins with a discussion of inalienably possessed nouns which include kinship
terms, terms for body parts and spatial nouns, and alienably possessed nouns.
Subsequently, lexical nominalisation and compound nouns are treated. The class of
demonstratives is described in §4.4, followed by a discussion on question words in §4.5.
6162Chapter 4Following this, in §4.6, the number system, which is based on terms for body parts, is
presented. The six subclasses of adverbs, namely temporal adverbs, manner adverbs,
aspect adverbs, locative adverbs, negators and focus adverbs are discussed in §4.7. Section
4.8 covers locational forms including location markers and directionals. Finally, the
remaining word classes are presented, namely coordinators (§4.9), subordinate clause
markers (§4.10), the enumerator (§4.11), and interjections (§4.12). In each section, I will
first give the morphological characteristics (if present) of a word class, followed by
syntactic criteria in cases where morphological criteria alone are not sufficient.
There are some instances where the classes overlap. For instance, in the class of
numerals (§4.6), inalienably possessed nouns that refer to body parts, such as atem
‘hand/arm’ and krem ‘finger/toe’ (§4.3.1) are used. The demonstrative forms (§4.4)
comprise demonstrative prefixes, and some of these prefixes are also used on interrogative
forms (§4.5). The two location markers to ‘LOC’ and wo ‘LOC.GEN’ (§4.8.1) seem to be
related to demonstrative prefixes (§4.4). Likewise, the morpheme ro, which marks relative
clauses (§4.10.1), and the forms wo-re and fi-re, which mark locative and manner
adverbial clauses respectively (§4.10.2), all include morphemes that are related to
demonstrative forms. In other words, a morpheme cannot always be assigned to one single
word class.
4.1 Person deixis
Person deixis is expressed through bound personal pronouns in the form of person
prefixes on verbs and inalienably possessed nouns, and through free personal pronouns.
The free personal pronouns can be affixed with ro- ‘POSS’ and po- ‘EMPH’ to form
possessive and emphatic personal pronouns. In some emphatic forms, a numeral is used to
express person deixis. Syntactically, pronouns may be used in the place of a noun or a
noun phrase.
In §4.1.1, I will discuss the person prefixes. Following this, in §4.1.2, the possessive
pronouns are presented. In §4.1.3 the emphatic forms are introduced. Finally, in §4.1.4, I
will give other pronominal forms.
4.1.1 Person prefixes
In §3.1, I introduced the person prefixes, and the morphophonological constraints that
dictate whether or not they are phonologically expressed. The person prefixes are repeated
below:
(1)
S1
2
3M
3Ufree form
tuo
nuo
ait
aubound form
tnym-P1
2
3amu
anu
anapnm-Word classes63Possibly, the first and second person singular bound forms are derived from the
respective free forms. For the other forms, there does not seem to be an overt
morphological connection between the bound forms and the free forms. In the free forms
of the plural pronouns, the first phoneme is invariably /a/, while the second is a nasal.
Person prefixes are taken by verbs and inalienably possessed nouns. There is subject
agreement, that is in clauses the person prefix on the verb must be coreferent with the
subject of the clause — see an example in (2) — and inalienably possessed nouns take a
person prefix that agrees with the possessor of the noun (3).
(2) a.ait y-amo
3M 3M-go
‘he goes’b.nuo n-amo
2S 2-go
‘you go’(3) a.t-ana
1S-head
‘my head’b.y-ana
3M-head
‘his head’Because words from two different word classes take these person prefixes, the presence
of a person prefix cannot be used as the sole criterion to classify a word. Therefore,
syntactic criteria are needed as well, as will be illustrated in the course of the discussion on
verbs and nouns.
There is a distinction in gender, namely between masculine and unmarked in the third
person singular pronoun in both the free forms and the bound forms. Gender is according
to natural gender: masculine is used for male human and, for instance in fables, male
animate. In both cases, the referent must be singular:
(4)rae y-amo aya1
man 3M-go water
‘The man goes to the river.’(5)fane y-tien
pig 3M-sleep
‘The boar sleeps.’The unmarked bound form m- is used to refer to all third person forms that do not fall
under the heading ‘masculine human singular’, that is all other third person singular and
plural forms. Some examples:
(6)fai
m-haif
rako2
woman 3U-chop firewood
‘The woman/women chop(s) firewood.’(7)ru m-amo Senopi
bird 3U-go Senopi
‘The aeroplane/aeroplanes3 go(es) to Senopi.’(8)fane m-aku
m-som
pig 3U-small 3U-play
‘The piglet/piglets play(s).’1
2
3Aya is used to refer to ‘water’ and ‘river’. In this work, I have translated aya as ‘water’.
Rako is a lexicalised compound noun, consisting of the noun ara ‘wood’ and the verb -ko ‘burn’.
Ru ‘bird’ is also used to refer to ‘aeroplane’.","[78, 79, 80, 81]"

its function is similar to that of iye:
(309)fai

‘The woman also lives at Kuom.’(310)yamo si tipuo

example (311). In this context, si expresses simultaneity (see also §9.1.6).

In the example below the adverb suek semantically modifies the NP ku kiniah. A number of informants
gave the translation presented below, and not ‘The small children are very small.’, as would be expected if
suek is interpreted as a clausal modifier.

exception of re ‘please’, are further discussed in §6.8.4.
4.8 Location
There are a number of forms that indicate where or in what direction the action
described in the clause takes place. Some of these forms have already been discussed,
namely spatial nouns (§4.3.1), demonstratives (§4.4) and locative adverbs (§4.7.4). In this
section I will discuss the remaining forms that express location. These are, roughly
speaking, the location markers to ‘LOC’ and wo ‘LOC.GEN’, and the directionals u ‘up’ and
tis ‘behind’. While some of these forms can function as free morphemes, others are only
attested as bound forms. What all the forms expressing location have in common is that
they occur in the location periphery in clause, and that the main verb in the clause in which
they occur is normally a motion or position verb (see §4.2.3.2).
4.8.1 to and wo
The forms to and wo are related to the demonstrative prefixes te- ‘area.N’ and we‘location.GEN’. Recall that these prefixes are also used in the formation of question words
(see §4.5). Because to and wo have a very general function, that is, they are used to mark
forms that express ‘location’, they are glossed as LOC and LOC.GEN respectively. Below, I
will describe these location markers. The form wo is only used in complex directionals,
and the discussion of these forms is deferred until §4.8.2.
When to functions as a location marker, it marks the following NP as a location. It can
be adequately translated as ‘to, at’. The form wo cannot function as a location marker. This
is ‘natural’, since when a location marker precedes an NP that expresses location, this is a
location that can be pinpointed. Therefore, the use of the general location marker wo here
is inadequate. Some examples follow:
(314)ø-frok
to Kumurkek
ø-emerge LOC Kumurkek
‘He arrives at Kumurkek.’(315)amu p-mo to

‘vegetables, vegetables we eat’
< :po: ‘NOM’ + :pat: plural stem of :-apat: ‘eat vegetables’The question arises whether or not these plural stems can be interpreted as monosyllabic
lengthening. However, a phonetically long vowel also occurs in po-iit [»po-i:t] ‘food, things
we eat’, This is not a monosyllabic form. I conclude that the long vowels in these forms
cannot be attributed to monosyllabic lengthening. Note that differences between singular
and plural stems also occur in other Bird’s Head languages, for example Moi (Menick pers.
comm.) and Tehit (Flassy 1991).
3.4 Alternations in prefixes
In the formation of possessive forms, the possessive prefix :ro: ‘POSS’ is attached to a
pronoun. This prefix has two phonetic realisations: [r] if the following pronoun is vowelinitial, and [ro] if the following pronoun is consonant-initial.5

A traditional shaman sometimes rubs, blows on or simply looks at plants or parts of plants, in order to
receive answers to questions concerning healing. This is called baca obat, lit. ‘read medicine’ in
Indonesian. I have translated this as ‘to divine’ in this text. ø-sus ‘divine’, especially for women to attract
luck or fortune (W. Avé pers. comm.) seems to imply divination by looking at something, while ø-tamah
‘divine’ (line 56) implies divination by blowing into something. Tkief (line 58) also refers to ‘divine’, but
it is unclear to me what type of divination is meant.

"232Chapter 9It is possible that the coordinator re is related to the demonstrative prefix re‘location.SPEC’. The pragmatic function of the coordinator re may be interpreted as
marking a ‘topic’, or a ‘given’ according to which an action is carried out. Coordinators
that mark semantic categories such as purpose, cause, reason or conditionals often derive
from demonstrative elements, as attested in many languages. Some examples from
Germanic languages are the Old English coordinator for þaem ‘for that, because’ (Traugott
1985:297), English coordinator so that; the Dutch coordinator omdat ‘because, as’
containing dat ‘that’; and daarom and daardoor ‘therefore, so’ both containing the
demonstrative daar ‘there’. In a broad pragmatic sense each of these coordinators mark the
preceding clause as a ‘given’ in the discourse.
9.1.5 Cause/Reason
There are two coordinators indicating cause or reason, namely mi ‘so that’ and ke
‘because’. Intonationally, mi occurs in clause-initial position. Some examples are:
(42)tuo t-awe ku
y-hai awiáh / mi
y-awià
1S 1S-say child 3M-die taro
so.that 3M-cry
‘I think the child is hungry so that he is crying.’(43)n-no fi-yé

t-awe ø-hawe t-ait po-iìt
1S-stomach 3U-queasy-REDUP
so.that 1S-say ø-refuse 1S-eat NOM-eat.P
‘I feel queasy, so that I think I don’t want to eat food.’Sentences with mi can also be interpreted as conditionals, depending on the context in
which the utterance occurs. This similarity in form between causals and conditionals
reflects their semantic similarity. In conditionals in natural languages, it must be possible
to interpret the content of the protasis as a cause of the content of the apodosis. So, there is
a causal link between the protasis and the apodosis (Comrie 1986:80). In a conditional
interpretation, mi marks the following clause as the apodosis. There are no syntactic or
intonational criteria to make a formal distinction between mi as a coordinator meaning ‘so
that’ and mi marking the apodosis of a conditional structure. Some (elicited) examples:
(45)om m-aís

‘The aeroplane will come, so I will wait there and pick up the visitor.’ Or:
‘If the aeroplane comes, I will wait there and pick up the visitor.’Complex constructions 233
Like the coordinator re, mi may be related to a demonstrative prefix, namely me‘PRESTT’. However, this is rather unlikely, since the coordinator mi and the demonstrative
prefix me- are not homophonous (the coordinator re and the demonstrative prefix re- are).
Example (48) is in minimal opposition with (40), repeated below as (49). These
examples illustrate how both re and mi can be used to express a causal relationship.
(48)t-amo orá

/ re
orie mti
p-iit
ara sasù
1S-go garden in.order.to later night 1P-eat.P {cassava}
‘I will go to the garden, so that tonight we eat cassava.’The coordinator ke ‘because of’ and mi ‘so that’ are each other’s mirror-image:
‘Clause1 ke Clause2’ means ‘Clause1 because of Clause2’, while ‘Clause1 mi Clause2’
means ‘because of Clause1, Clause2’.
Like re and mi, ke ‘because of’ occurs in clause-initial position. Some examples are:

preceded by a long pause and a sharp drop in pitch on the last stressed syllable preceding
ke.

you don’t go and marry women from there (i.e. a different place) because then
you let go of your in-laws, our women and our in-laws are on friendly terms (lit.
‘greet each other’).’
The clause marked by ke can refer to an actual event or to a hypothetical event. The
contrast between actual and hypothetical depends on the context in which the utterance
occurs. There are no morphological or syntactic criteria for making this distinction. In
examples (50)–(51) above the clause following ke refers to an actual event. In the two
examples below, the reason is hypothetical:234

When si ‘also’ (see §4.7.6) occurs in clause-final position in each clause in a sequence
of two clauses, it expresses simultaneity:
(55)tuo tutup kios si,
ana tutup amah ø-kiyam si

‘You write a letter and give it to me, and at the same time I will write a letter
and give it to you.’ (implication: we write to each other)9.2 Adverbial clauses
As mentioned in §4.10.2, a distinction can be made between three types of adverbial
clauses in Maybrat, namely temporal adverbial clauses, locative adverbial clauses and
manner adverbial clauses. The function of adverbial clauses is to modify the main clause.
All adverbial clauses are introduced by a marker.
In many ways, adverbial clauses and RCs are similar. In §5.4, I showed that the RC
marker ro is possibly related to the demonstrative prefix re-. As will be illustrated in this
section, adverbial clause markers might also be related to, or contain forms that are related
to, demonstratives and question words. This homogeneity in markers can be explained in
functional terms: both RCs and adverbial clauses are modifiers which function as specifiers
or determiners; RCs restrict the potential referent of a noun, and adverbial clauses specify
the circumstances of an event (Dik 1997:84). In both cases, the marker that introduces
them functions as a kind of ‘traffic sign’ to interpret the following clausal construction.
Given this functional similarity, it is not odd that the markers that introduce these clausal
constructions derive from forms which functionally determine or specify a referent, namely
demonstratives and interrogatives. This tendency is also common in other languages (cf.
Hopper & Traugott 1993:195–196; Dik 1997:80).
Formally, temporal adverbial clauses are structurally completely parallel to RCs in that
they have a (nominal) head followed by a marker and a restricting clause. Locative and
manner adverbial clauses do not have a nominal ‘head’, but do have a marker followed by
a restricting clause, which modifes the main clause. In all cases the marker seems to
contain at least one element that is associated with a clearly nominal function, that is the
prefix re- or we-, or the interrogative form p-awiya ‘what’. This reflects the nominalComplex constructions 235
character of all these clauses, which is also common in functionally similar constructions
in other languages (see for instance, Dik 1997:87).
9.2.1 Temporal adverbials
There are two types of temporal adverbial clauses, namely those introduced by um ro
‘the moment (SPEC)’ and those marked by kine wo ‘the time (GEN)’. Temporal adverbial
clauses are only attested in sentence-initial position. Some examples are:
(57)um
ro y-roh
re-t-o
Hari Selasa
moment REL 3M-descend location.SPEC-near-U {Tuesday}
‘The moment he descended it was Tuesday.’(58)um
ro m-fit-fit
t-a
ø-sikat m-roh
moment REL 3U-yank.grass-REDUP near-U ø-thirsty 3U-descend
m-amo m-atuah asam kek
3U-go 3U-cut {red sugarcane}
‘The moment she was weeding, she got thirsty, she went down and cut
some red sugarcane.’(59)kine wo t-amo Sorong ø-tim am
time REL 1S-go Sorong ø-send letter
‘When I go down to Sorong, I will send a letter.’(60)kine wo ø-spis am
m-suoh
yu ø-siwia
time REL ø-sew rain.cape 3U-weave bag ø-tie
‘The time when they sewed rain capes, they (also) wove bags and they tied them.’The difference between forms including um ro and kine wo is one of specificity: in (58),
for example, the moment at which the woman gets thirsty can be pinpointed. Conversely,
in (59) the moment of going to Sorong is non-specific: the use of kine wo implies that no
concrete plan has been made yet. The difference between forms including ro and wo
referring to specific and non-specific respectively is the same as demonstrative forms
including the prefixes re- and we-, which also contrast for specificity. Given the similarity
in consonants between these forms, it is well possible that these ro/re- and wo/we- are
related to each other.
In the examples above, I have glossed ro and wo as ‘REL’ (relativiser). The reason for
this is that temporal adverbial clauses are formally parallel to RCs, as demonstrated below:
(61) gives an RC, whereas (62) gives a temporal adverbial clause. Structural similarity
between RCs and adverbial clauses is a common feature in languages (Foley 1986:202;
Thompson & Longacre 1985:178). In some Papuan languages, RCs and adverbial clauses
are formally identical, and can only be distinguished depending on the context in which
they appear, that is in Korowai (van Enk & de Vries 1997:115).
(61)rae
ro y-amo Sorong ø-kiyam m-ase
person REL 3M-go Sorong ø-ill
3U-very
‘The person who is going to Sorong is very ill.’(62)um
ro ana m-roh
rae
m-suoh
moment REL 3P 3U-descend person 3U-dance
‘When they come down, the people dance.’236Chapter 9That RCs and temporal adverbial clauses are similar also appears from their nominal
properties: like RCs, temporal adverbials are able to take a nominal demonstrative as a
modifier. This is illustrated in example (57) above, where the demonstrative re-t-o marks
the end of the NP, and Hari Selasa ‘Tuesday’ functions as a verbless clause. In (58) above,
the demonstrative t-a (a dialectal variant of t-o) occupies the final position in the NP.
Intonationally, sentences involving temporal adverbial clauses and RCs are also similar:
in both there is a slight rise in pitch on the last syllable of the clause. There is no explicit
pause preceding the main clause, but there is a small ‘hold-up’ (indicated ‘||’) to mark the
beginning of the main information clause — (61) and (62) are repeated as (63) and (64)
respectively:

Locative adverbial clauses can be introduced by the following markers:
(65)wo
wo-yo
wo-relocation.GEN
location.GEN-INT
location.GEN-PARTAll the locative adverbial clause markers incorporate the element wo-.17 In §4.5, I
illustrated that the demonstrative prefix we-/wo- and the interrogative prefix wo- are
related: they are both generic location markers. The element wo- in the adverbial clause
markers is not only formally similar to the generic location marker wo, and to the
demonstrative prefix we-/wo-, but all these markers are semantically similar: they
conceptually refer to ‘location’ in a generic sense. Therefore, I conclude that wo- in the
location markers is related to the generic location marker wo, and to the demonstrative
prefix we-/wo-.18
Examples of locative adverbial clause markers introduced by wo appear below:
(66)m-amo ø-sko

birth to them.’Locative adverbial clauses introduced by wo-yo ‘where’ are given in examples (67) and
(68). Recall that wo-yo is formally a question word.","[249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]"

interrogative prefixes to and wo is one of specificity: whereas to refers to a specific
location, wo refers to a general location, that is a location that cannot be pinpointed. This
same difference is found in forms where a complex directional prefixed with wo is
followed by a demonstrative form.

expression, that is *to-te wo-n-o.
4.8.3 Other forms with to
There are two spatial nouns preceded by to ‘LOC’ namely: to m-ato, as in (336) and
(337), and to m-apuo (338). Example (336) is structurally analogous to forms including122Chapter 4‘to+N’, as in (314)–(316). In (337) and (338), however, ‘to+spatial noun’ is followed by
yet another noun. In these examples, ‘to+spatial noun’ + N expresses a prepositional
notion. In the following section I present evidence which suggests the appearance of
prepositions.

The locative adverbs akah ‘above’ and ete ‘below’ and the directional tis ‘behind’ can
follow a noun, as illustrated in (339)–(340). In this respect akah, ete and tis are
syntactically similar to the spatial nouns, which occur in possessive constructions in which
the spatial noun follows the head noun (see §4.3.1).
(339)y-hu
ara akah
3M-stay tree above
‘He is in the top of the tree.’ (lit. ‘the tree’s “above”’)(340)fiam
aya
ete68
catfish water below
‘There are catfish under the water.’ (lit. ‘the water’s “below”’)(341)smai m-ae amah tis
bean 3u-at house behind
‘The beans are behind the house.’ (lit. ‘at the house’s “behind”’)Recall that akah and ete (but not tis) can also precede a noun, see also (295) and (296):
(342)ku y-ros
akah meja
child 3M-stand above table
‘The child stands on the table.’(343)wata
m-hu ete
aya
fish.trap 3U-stay below water
‘The fish trap is under water.’The syntactic behaviour of akah and ete in genitival constructions may be an indication
that these forms were once spatial nouns, and are now being grammaticalised into
prepositions. It is conceivable that during this grammaticalisation process, a putative
person prefix m- was lost, since many grammaticalisation processes go together with a
loss of morphology (Hopper 1991:22). Also, during a grammaticalisation process, the
68This is a nominal clause. See §6.5 for a discussion on nominal clauses.","[139, 140]"
"88Chapter 4between 1972–74, that is twenty-five years before I collected data in Ayawasi. Although
informants were able to translate it, they identified it as a form that is no longer used.
(150)ait y-ato
3M 3M-hole
‘He is riddled (with bullets).’ (lit. ‘He is holed.’)Other forms with putative person prefixes other than m- appeared unacceptable upon
elicitation, for example *t-asuf, *t-apuo.23
Examples of possessive constructions involving spatial nouns are:
(151)amah m-aom
house 3U-outside
‘outside the house’ (lit. ‘the outside of the house’)(152)aya
m-asuf
water 3U-middle
‘the middle of the water’ (lit. ‘the water’s middle’)(153)ara m-ato
tree 3U-hole
‘inside the tree’ (lit. ‘the tree’s inside’)The uniformity in the first consonant ‘m’ in the spatial nouns can hardly be attributed to
sheer coincidence: it suggests that the spatial nouns are fossilised forms of inalienably
possessed nouns that used to take person prefixes other than m-. Given the uniformity in
form among the spatial nouns, the (archaic) form in (150), and the similarity in behaviour
of all these nouns in possessive constructions, I conclude that spatial nouns are a subclass
of inalienably possessed nouns.
Although the spatial nouns are classified as a subclass of the nouns, their nominal
character can arguably be questioned: as opposed to regular nouns, spatial nouns lack some
typically nominal features. For example, m-ato is the only spatial noun that can function as
the subject of a clause, as in (154), or as the head of an NP (155).
(154)m-ato
m-ae ara
3U-hole 3U-at tree
‘There’s a hole in the wood.’(155)m-ato m-api re-t-o
3U-hole 3U-big location.SPEC-near-U
‘this big hole’23The form suf ‘middle’ is used by members of the Air family, who have their origins in the area to the
north of Ayawasi. Suf is semantically similar to m-asuf ‘middle’, the form used in Ayawasi. Formally,
the ‘northern’ form lacks a putative person prefix m-, and a vowel a. An example is iso suf ‘the middle
of the path’ which is a possessive construction of the type possessor-possessed:
y-amo ø-frok
iso suf
3M-go ø-emerge path middle
‘He emerges at the middle of the path.’Word classes89Another form which may be a spatial noun is mpair ‘place’. Although this form is
unattested in possessive constructions of the type ‘possessor-possessed’, it is formally
similar to the other spatial nouns in that it is m-initial.24 It can occur as the head of an NP:
(156)mpair m-of
place 3U-good
‘The place is good.’While spatial nouns are in some ways formally and syntactically similar to other
inalienably possessed nouns, they also lack some properties that are typically associated
with nouns.
4.3.2 Alienably possessed nouns
Alienably possessed nouns are those forms which cannot take person prefixes. In other
words, unlike the inalienably possessed nouns, the possessor of an alienably possessed
noun is not marked on the noun.
In possessive constructions where the alienably possessed noun is the possessed, the
order of the constituents is possessed-possessor, where the possessor is preceded by the
possessive marker ro. Some examples:
(157)amah ro-Petrus
house POSS-Petrus
‘Petrus’ house’(158)amah ro-t-atia
house POSS-1S-father
‘my father’s house’(159)po-ø-satoh
r-au
NOM-ø-collect POSS-3U
‘her possessions’(160)fane ro-Yan
pig POSS-Yan
‘Yan’s pig’See §5.2 for a more detailed treatment of possessive constructions.
4.3.3 Gender and number in nouns
Maybrat nouns have natural gender: nouns referring to male human or, in some cases,
male animate, are masculine. The other nouns are unmarked. This gender distinction is
only expressed in inalienably possessed nouns in the third person singular. Some examples
of masculine and unmarked subjects appear below, where the subject of the clause is
formally a kinship term as in (161) and (162), a body-part term as in (163) and (164) and
an alienably possessed noun (165) and (166).","[105, 106, 107]"
"9Complex constructionsComplex constructions are constructions that involve more than one clause with a
marker to indicate the relationship between these clauses. Because of the presence of a
marker, complex constructions are formally different from the constructions involving
sequences of verbs. A distinction can be made between two types of complex construction,
namely coordinating constructions and adverbial clauses. Coordinating constructions
contain two functionally equivalent members bound by means of a linking device (Dik
1997:189). Adverbial clauses are constructions which function as modifiers of clauses
(Thompson & Longacre 1985:172). Adverbial clauses are syntactically parallel to RCs in
that they are introduced by a marker, and that the restricting clause modifies the (clausal)
head.
I will begin with a discussion of coordinating complex constructions in §9.1, followed
by a discussion of adverbial clauses in §9.2. In §9.3, I will describe some functional
properties of p-awiya, which is formally an interrogative. It will appear that p-awiya can
function as a coordinator, and as a kind of copula-linker between an NP or a locative
adverbial and a clause. Finally, in §9.4, I will discuss some style figures that are commonly
used in Maybrat.
9.1 Coordination
In coordinated sentences, two clauses are linked by an interclausal coordinator. The
coordinator that links the two clauses is invariably found between the clauses that are
linked. Coordinated clauses are always separated by an intonation break. Within sentences,
such a break always directly precedes the coordinator. This break is manifested as a rise in
pitch on the final syllable of the preceding clause followed by a pause. An example follows
(mati is the coordinator):
(1)t-amo Soróng / mati
ø-tim àm /
1S-go Sorong
and.then ø-send letter
‘I am going to Sorong and then I will send a letter.’Linking usually occurs within one sentence, but may also occur across sentence
boundaries. When this is the case, the coordinator can be placed either in sentence-initial or
in sentence-final position. In sentence-initial position, the coordinator is preceded by
sentence-final intonation of the previous sentence, that is a fall in pitch followed by a
pause. This is illustrated in example (2), where m-nan is the coordinator. In other words,
222Complex constructions 223
the difference between linking within sentences and linking across sentence boundaries is
that in the former there is a rise in pitch, while in the latter there is a fall. If the coordinator
occurs in sentence-final position, the fall in pitch is on the coordinator, followed by a
pause, as in (3) (the coordinator here is na).

‘Once upon a time a man went and saw (it) like this. Then he followed the
nest, the pig with her children, their footsteps.’ (lit. ‘their feet’, but referring
to ‘footsteps’ in this context.)In §4.9, I presented a class of coordinators. In addition to these coordinators there are a
number of elements that formally belong to other word classes, but that can function as
coordinators. These are: m-nan ‘it is enough’, ‘it is finished’, (or ‘it is similar to’) (verb); o
‘ENUM’ (enumerator); and fe ‘NEG’ (adverb).
Because there are no syntactic criteria to subdivide different kinds of coordination, I
have decided to describe the coordinators in terms of meaning. Roughly, five semantic
groups can be distinguished, namely sequentiality (§9.1.1); enumeration (§9.1.2);
disjunction (§9.1.3); purpose (§9.1.4); and cause/reason (§9.1.5). In §9.3, I will treat the
form p-awiya, which is formally a question word (see §4.5), but can also function as a
coordinator and as an adverbial clause marker.
9.1.1 Sequentiality
The three coordinators that can express sequentiality are mati, na and m-nan. When they
occur between two clauses the ordering of the events is always iconic, that is the event that
occurs first in time is also the event that is first mentioned.
9.1.1.1 The coordinator mati
In examples (4a) and (5a) constructions with the coordinator mati are given. In (4a) mati
expounds the sequentiality which is implicitly present in the corresponding b-varieties.
Example (5a) is semantically an emphatic conditional construction: mati marks the
following clause as valid only if the action expressed in the first clause is fulfilled. This
emphasis is absent in the first clause.","[239, 240, 241]"

‘Ayawasi that he sends a letter to is nice.’However, in example (152), extraction of the object of the third verb, tapam ‘land’ was
always considered acceptable, see for example (152c). Apparently tapam ‘land’ can be
understood as the topic of the RC. It is difficult to find a semantic motivation for the
unacceptability of (150b), and for the acceptability of (152c). It seems that in sequences
with three verbs, it cannot be completely predicted whether the object of a verb can or
cannot be extracted.

mud 3U-many
‘The ground on which he fells the sago tree and it breaks and crashes is
very muddy.’In sequences of two verbs, of which one is a motion verb, a position verb, or a shared
argument construction verb, the first object can be extracted. Likewise, in ‘valencyincreasing’ constructions, the argument that functions as the object of the first verb and the
subject of the second verb can be extracted. Apparently, all these verbs, when combined220Chapter 8with other verbs, yield constructions from which objects can be extracted without giving
rise to ‘logical conflicts’ and hence unacceptability.
In other words, these constructions seem similar to two types of construction discussed
before: they are similar to coordinating constructions from the point of view of intonation,
and morphology, and they behave largely the same when placed in the interrogative mood.
However, these forms violate the CSC. This makes them similar to the constructions
involving an object complement, which also ‘violate’ the CSC. Indeed, in many of the
problematic constructions the second clause can be analysed as an object complement of
the first clause, as illustrated below (see also the examples in §8.3):
(153) a.b.(154) a.b.ø-hren [[t-kom
am]]
ø-sit
1S-write letter
‘I sit and write a letter.’
ø-hren [[tapam]]
ø-sit

‘I sit on the ground.’
m-amo [[m-ate
aya]]
3U-go 3U-go.under water
‘She goes and bathes.’
m-amo [[aya]]
3U-go water
‘She goes to the river.’However, in §8.3 I illustrated that in constructions involving an object complement, a
pause between the two verbs can bring about a significant change in meaning. This is not
the case for these ‘problematic’ verb sequences. Thus, according to the criteria set in this
chapter, they keep a middle way between coordinating constructions and constructions
involving an object complement.
A case could be made for the presence of serial verb constructions in Maybrat. In what
are claimed to be serialising languages, the motion verbs ‘come’ and ‘go’ and the position
verbs ‘stand’ and ‘stay’ are commonly found in serial verb constructions (Foley & Olson
1985:41–42). The same is true for a verb like -o, which expresses a semantic function
similar to ‘instrumental’ (Sebba 1987:162). Likewise, ‘shared argument’ constructions,
such as ‘X kills Y dies’, as in example (145) above, are common in serialising languages
(Sebba 1987:197). Hamel (1993) refers to this type of construction as ‘causative/result’
where the main verb is the cause, and the serial verb is the result. And lastly, serialising
languages often use ‘valency-increasing’ constructions to make it possible to add an extra
argument to an expression (Foley & Olson 1985:48; Sebba 1987:216; Zwicky 1990:3).
The question is if the constructions discussed in this section really qualify as ‘serial’.
The term ‘serial verb construction’ itself has been the subject of much debate in recent
linguistic literature. Zwicky (1990:2) states that the term ‘serial’ is often used to refer to
juxtaposed verbs in general, without stating explicitly the relationship between these verbs.
Thus, if taken loosely, all the sequences of verbs in this chapter qualify as serial. However,
in the literature the term ‘serial’ is usually applied to a specific type of verb series. Some
formal criteria that apply to ‘serial verb constructions’ are as follows:Sequences of verbs
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)221They have only one overtly expressed (syntactic) subject (Sebba 1987:86).
There must be no ascertainable clause boundary between the two verbs
(Sebba 1987:39).
There cannot be any overt conjunctions between the verbs (Zwicky 1990:4;
Foley & Olson 1985:18; Sebba 1987:39).
All the verbs have the same aspect, tense and mood (Zwicky 1990:4; Foley &
Olson 1985:28; Sebba 1987:39).
Verbs in a serial verb construction must also be able to occur as single
predicates.
The serial verbs refer to one single event (Comrie 1995:26).","[237, 238, 239]"
"Sequences of verbs193The three adverbial verbs that can occur as bare-stem second verbs in a sequence are
-akus ‘left.behind’, -rof ‘follow’, -roh ‘descend’. Examples where -akus functions as a
main verb follow — (25) is repeated from §4.2:
(25)rae
m-e
biskuì / tuo t-akùs
/
person 3U-give biscuit
1S 1S-left.behind
‘The people give biscuits, I’m left out.’ (i.e. I don’t get any)(26)t-se
sasu
m-akùs
/
1S-place sweet.potato 3U-leave.behind
‘I place the sweet potato and it is left behind.’Morphologically, the difference between (26) and the forms in (27) (below) is evident:
in (27), -akus does not take a person prefix. The forms also differ clearly in meaning: (26)
is used when an object (here sasu ‘sweet potato’) is left behind for good, that is it will not
be collected later. Example (27) implies that the object which is left behind is only left
temporarily. It will be picked up later. Intonationally, (27) is only acceptable if it is
dominated by a single intonation contour. The two forms in (27) do not contrast in
meaning.

1S-place sweet.potato left.behind
‘I place the sweet potato and leave it temporarily.’b.t-se
akus
sasu
1S-place left.behind sweet.potato
‘I place the sweet potato and leave it temporarily.’There are a number of ways to indicate that constructions with bare-stem second verbs
have all the characteristics of single verb clauses: first, changing the sequences in (26) and
(27) into questions yields the utterances in (28) and (29) below: (28) behaves like a
coordinating construction, because the scope of the interrogator can be either the entire
expression (reading 1.) or the last verb m-akus (reading 2.). Conversely, in (29) the entire
utterance is included in the scope of the interrogator: the scope of the interrogative marker
cannot be over just the bare-stem second verb plus its object as in reading 2. in (29a).

sasu

a
1S-place sweet.potato left.behind INT
‘Do I place the sweet potato and is it left behind temporarily?’Constructions with bare-stem second verbs always take just one intonation-contour, and
the coordinator mati cannot occur between the main verb and the bare-stem verb without
rendering the utterance ungrammatical. This confirms the monoclausal character of these194Chapter 8constructions. In addition, the object in these constructions can be extracted,7 as it can out
of (almost)8 any monoclausal construction. I have included the determiner re-t-o ‘that’ in
the examples to demarcate the NP:
(30)sasu
ro t-se

Ø akus
re-t-o

sweet.potato REL 1S-place
left.behind location.spec-near-U 3U-bad
‘This sweet potato that I left behind temporarily is bad.’This suggests that t-se akus sasu and t-se sasu akus constitute one single clause.
Some more examples of constructions with bare-stem second verbs are given in
examples (32)–(33). In each case, the a-varieties show that these verbs can also appear as
full verbs, and the other varieties show the same verb without a person prefix. The
behaviour of these constructions with bare-stem second verbs is completely analogous to
the behaviour of the sequence -se akus.

the only form in which a bare-stem verb follows the object. In the other verb sequences of
this type, the object cannot precede the bare-stem verb, that is (34) is unacceptable:

potato that I leave behind and it is left, is rotten’. This construction is similar to some of the problematic
constructions to be discussed in §8.7.
Recall that idiomatic expressions do not allow extraction of the object, such as -hai awiah ‘be hungry’
(§4.2.2.1).","[210, 211, 212]"

obligatory person prefix (whether overt or covert), as is evident from the examples given in
(124)–(127) above.
Thirdly, it is always possible to insert the coordinator mati between the verbs without
significantly changing the meaning of the utterance:

polar questions, the utterance becomes ambiguous, because the scope can be over either
the entire proposition, or over just the last ‘conjunct’:

2. ‘You take the tobacco, but will you give it to him,
or will you do something else with it?’Like the coordinating sequences, these constructions can be disambiguated by inserting
a pause between the two verbs: example (134) only allows one interpretation.

3U-stab pig
3U-dead INT
‘He stabs the pig, but does it die?’A problem is presented by the examples containing a motion verb as the second verb in
the sequence: here the scope of the interrogator is necessarily over both verbs. So, example
(135) cannot be interpreted as *‘I pour the water, but does it ‘go’ (rather than ‘come’, or
‘fall’) into the thermos flask?’. Likewise, (136) cannot mean *‘He sends a letter, but does it
‘come’ (rather than ‘arrive at’, or ‘go to’) to Ayawasi?’ In other words, these sequences
behave similarly to the sequences involving an object-complement as discussed in §8.3:
placing these in the interrogative mood also resulted in an unambiguous reading.

‘Should he send a letter to Ayawasi?’a
INTThe fact that the result of the manipulation in the constructions in examples (135) and
(136) is at odds with the results in the other constructions, which are all like coordinating
constructions, is not a big problem: it is conceivable that m-amo cerek in (135) and m-ama
Ayawasi in (136) cannot be interpreted as main clauses, because they give the direction of
the action expressed in the first verb in the sequence, and are therefore semantically
inseparable from the first verb.
However, (135) and (136) are not the only forms that are exceptional in behaviour. All
the constructions discussed so far in this section deviate from the coordinating sequences216Chapter 8in one important respect: to a certain extent, they allow extraction of objects, or, in other
words, they violate Ross’ CSC.
Consider the following examples, all of which have an object on the first verb. In each
case, this object can be extracted, as illustrated in the b-forms:
(137) a.b.(138) a.b.(139) a.b.y-hu

ø-collect
3U-tallIn all the b-examples in (137)–(139) the head (=the object of the first verb) of the RC
can be the understood ‘topic’ of that RC without resulting in a ‘logical conflict.’ In all nonrelativised instances in (137)–(139), the object of the first verb is also the semantic
‘subject’ of the second verb, which may explain why this object is allowed to become the
understood ‘topic’ of the sentence. This is not the case for po-safom in (139c), as it cannot
be the topic of the first clause in the RC y-ros lapangan, hence there is a logical conflict,
and the sentence is ungrammatical.
If the first verb does not have an object, then the object on the second verb can be
extracted. In examples (140)–(143), the first verb can, but need not take an object. In all
these examples, the head of the RC can be understood as the topic of the entire RC, hence
the sentences are grammatical.

"Introduction5Bird’s Head. The language described in the present study is a family-level isolate within
the West Papuan Phylum (WPP).8 This phylum also includes some North Halmahera
languages (Voorhoeve 1987a:717).9
Some characteristics shared by all the WPP10 languages of the Bird’s Head are their
SVO word order, as opposed to the SOV order of those of the TNGP languages. All WPP
languages have prefixes that are coreferent with the subject (for verbs), or with the
possessor (of inalienably possessed nouns). In most languages there is a gender distinction,
and an opposition between inclusive and exclusive forms in the first person plural (Reesink
1996:2–3).11 There seem to be some similarities in the pronominal prefix systems across
WPP languages, suggesting a genetic relation (Cowan 1953:24–26; Reesink 1996:4). All
known languages display sequences of verbs under one clausal intonation contour (Reesink
1996:6), and the word order in NPs is generally: Noun-Adjective-(Classifier)-NumeralDeterminer (Reesink 1996:8). Nominal compounds generally have the order ‘N1+ N2’,
where the whole noun is ‘a kind of N2’ (Reesink 1996:13).
Recent research,12 however, has indicated that viewing the WPP as a group of
genetically related languages is difficult to maintain: in a comparative study Reesink has
hypothesised no less than seven unrelated language groups (Reesink 1996:18). A striking
feature of these languages is the low number of shared lexical items found between the
groups, contrasting with typological similarities. This has led to the hypothesis that
thousands of years ago, possibly even before the arrival of the Austronesians on the
peninsula,13 a number of unrelated languages were spoken in the Bird’s Head peninsula.
Through trade a kind of ‘Sprachbund’ emerged, in which morphosyntactic features were
shared, but vocabularies were not (Reesink 1996:x). So, instead of finding new evidence
for the interrelatedness of the languages of the WPP, recent research has only created an
even more confusing linguistic map of the Bird’s Head area.
1.5 Previous research in Maybrat
Before 1993, some research had been done in the Maybrat area. The first linguistic
notes were made by J.-E. Elmberg, who worked in the Ayamaru area between 1953 and
1957. The Popot feast cycle (1966) includes sixteen pages of transcriptions of texts in the
dialect of Ayamaru (below referred to as Maymaru). These transcriptions give an idea of
the language, but the English translations are free, that is there are no interlinear glosses,
and there is no morphological breakdown. No orthographic conventions are given, so only
very superficial phonetic information can be gathered from these texts. The work also
8A family-level isolate is a language which, on its own, comprises one Family of a Stock (Wurm &
McElhanon 1975:152).
9
Foley (1986) does not discuss the WPP at all, as hardly any information on this Phylum was available.
10
However, most WPP languages on Halmahera do have SOV word order (Voorhoeve 1988:192–193; van
Staden pers. comm.).
11
Both the SVO word order and the inclusive/exclusive distinction are typically Austronesian
characteristics. With respect to the opposition between inclusive and exclusive which is not grammatically
expressed, Maybrat is an exception in the Bird’s Head. The absence of this opposition was also pointed
out by Cowan (1953:21). For more information on first person plural forms in Maybrat (see §4.1.1).
12
Within ISIR, work has been done on the languages Moi (Menick 1995, 1996); Hatam (Reesink 1999);
Inanwatan (de Vries 1996); Mpùr (Odé 1995:1996).
13
According to radiocarbon dating of archaeological remains, the Austronesian population started to
disperse into Western Oceania around 3300 BP (Bellwood et al. 1998:233).","[22, 23]"

"Word classes99suffixes, -ait is isomorphous with the free form of the third person masculine pronoun ait
‘he’. These suffixes are used in the same way as person prefixes, namely according to
natural gender. This gender distinction is only relevant for the choice of suffix if the
demonstrative functions as a modifier to a noun and refers to a specific item (that is in
combination with the demonstrative prefix re-), and in the ‘presentative’ and with a fi‘similar.to’ prefix, but only if the demonstrative base is -t-. In all other cases the suffix -o is
used. Some examples in which masculine and unmarked forms are contrasted:

‘that woman’On the vertical axis in Table 1 (example 204) I have indicated the demonstrative
prefixes. Phonologically, these prefixes (with the exception of the fi- and ti- -forms)
normally have the form /Ce/, unless the demonstrative base is -n-: then the form of the
prefix is /Co/. Three exceptions are pe-n-o, m-n-o, and the masculine form re-n-e.
In the demonstrative forms a distinction can be made between demonstratives that
function attributively, namely those carrying a prefix re-, we-, te- or ti-, and demonstratives
that function adverbially, namely those with a prefix pe-, me- or fi-. A contrast between
two demonstrative forms that both refer to area, te- and pe-, is given in (208) and (209): in
the forms with te- the demonstrative functions attributively and in the forms with pe- it
functions adverbially:

followed by the adverbial demonstrative forms.
4.4.1 Demonstratives that function attributively
Demonstratives that function attributively are defined as those forms that typically
occupy the last position in an NP and that modify the head noun in an NP. In the forms
given in (200)–(203) and (205)–(207) above, the demonstrative forms are used
attributively. The demonstrative prefix re- is used because the head noun is specific, that is
it can be pinpointed. In these forms, the prefix may be omitted without significantly
changing the meaning of the utterance:
(211)po-kom
(re-)f-o
NOM-write (location.SPEC-)very.near-U
‘this pen very near’(212)po-kom

(location.SPEC-)far-U
‘that pen far away’po-komNOM-write(214)po-kom
(re-)au
NOM-write (location.SPEC-)U.DIST
‘that pen (unspecified for distance)’In the attributive demonstrative pronouns, a contrast in specificity can be made: as
opposed to re-, the prefix we- is used if the referent of the head noun is non-specific, that is
it cannot be pinpointed. Compare, for example, (215a) and (216a) with their respective bforms — repeated from (200) and (201). Example (215a) is used when a pen is within
reach, but its exact position is not known, that is it is not clear whether the pen is in front of
the speaker, behind the speaker and so on.43 In Ayawasi, re- can refer to both singular and
plural. Conversely, (215b) is used when the exact position of the pen is known.
43In some dialects, notably those spoken to the south of Ayawasi, we- is used for plural as opposed to re-,
which is used for singular.

This is the history of the lineage Tenau, the lineage that originally inhabited the area
where now Ayawasi is situated. It was told by Waisafo Tenau (wt) and Henky Tenau (h),
two village elders. Both are approximately 60 years of age. Waisafo Tenau’s mother
originally came from Aytinyo, where the dialect of Mayte is spoken (see §1.7), and
Wasafo lived there for a long time. Some forms in the text that he uses are dialectal, I have
indicated these.
In this history, the syntactic structure of Maybrat is amply illustrated: there are many
sequences of verbs. In the translations, I have attempted to retain some of this structure by
translating the sequences as literally as possible. Where this yielded very odd English
translations, I have made stylistic changes. As a result, many of these sequences are
translated as compound verbs, or constructions involving auxiliary verbs in English. These
translations, however, say nothing about the internal structure of the Maybrat verb
sequences. For a full discussion on Maybrat verb sequences, see Chapter 8.
This text is a transcription of a recording. The recording was made at a house in
Ayawasi using a walkman and a separate microphone. The text was transcribed with the
help of Petrus Turot. In this text some phonemic features have been marked, that is pauses
and rises and falls in pitch. A description of these features is given in §2.7. The symbols
used are as follows (see also the ‘conventions’):
# : long pause, typically marking the end of a sentence
/:
short pause, typically marking a small break in mid-sentence
grave accent ( › ) over a vowel:
falling pitch
acute accent ( ´ ) over a vowel:
rising pitch

"272.1.3 The phonemes /y/ and /w/
The segments [j] and [w] can be analysed as consonantal phonemes /y/ and /w/
respectively, or as allophones of the vowel phonemes /i/ and /u/. The reasons for analysing
these segments as consonantal phonemes are as follows:20 firstly, in word-initial position,
20An analysis in which [j] and [w] are allophones of /i/ and /u/ is given by Brown (1991), who did his
fieldwork in Ayamaru. He bases his argument on distinctive stress patterns. He argues that in unstressed
positions, the non-consonatal segments /i/ and /u/ can be realised as [y] (corresponding to [j] in the present
description) and [w] respectively. For example, /ni»o/ ‘you’ becomes /nio/ [»nyˆ], while in /»nio/ ‘You are
tall’ /i/ remains non-consonantal, yielding [»niyo]. In Ayawasi, these forms appear as [»nuwo] ‘you’ and
[»nijo] ‘You are tall’. Some phonemic contrasts for stress according to Brown are: [»nasçm] ‘You carry’ vs.
[na»som] ‘your name is’; [»maru] ‘She cuts’ vs. [ma»ru] ‘lake’; [»an´] ‘they’ vs. [a»na] ‘fence’ and [»moo]
‘She takes’ vs. [mo»o] ‘She itches’. In Ayawasi all these forms appear as homophones [»nasçm] ‘You
carry, your name is’; [»maru] ‘She cuts, lake’; [»ana] ‘they, fence’ and [»moo] ‘She takes, She itches’. Other
forms where Brown notes differing main stresses are [a»max] vs. Ayawasi [»amAx] ‘house’; [re»re] vs.
Ayawasi [»rere] ‘later’; [ta»bam] vs. Ayawasi [»tapAm] ‘earth’; [na»a] vs. Ayawasi [»na:] ‘your leg’; [i»so]
vs. Ayawasi [»iso] ‘road, trail’. In other words, whereas Brown found stress to be phonemic, which enables28Chapter 2[j] and [w] are distinctive, regardless of whether they occur before a vowel or before a
consonant.21 When [i] vs. [j] and [u] vs. [w] are artificially contrasted, the forms in which a
vowel [i]/[u] instead of a semivowel [j]/[w] is realised were rejected (marked ‘*’) by
informants.

‘decoration’[j] and [w] also appear as epenthetic elements between specific sequences of vowels
(see §2.2.1).23
2.2 Phonotactics
In this section I will discuss the various possible sequences of consonants and vowels in
monomorphemic forms. Section 2.2.1 deals with sequences of vowels and in §2.2.2
sequences of consonants are discussed.him to make generalisations about the realisation of the semivowels in unstressed positions, I only found
stress to be weakly phonemic. Admittedly the forms mentioned as homophones are suspicious, but
elaborate acoustic and perceptual experiments did not result in a verifiable difference between the
members of each pair (see Chapter 3, footnote 3).
21
The sequence /wC/ is very uncommon.
22
An epenthetic vowel schwa invariably occurs between two consonants (see §2.3.2).
23
Alternatively, word-initially and word-medially, the pairs /y/ and /i/, and the pairs /w/ and /u/ can be
analysed as being in complementary distribution, as the distinctive minimal pairs given above are not fully
airtight: some informants were unsure whether the forms marked ‘*’ in (7)–(9) were incorrect. The
majority, however, did reject them, which is why I analysed /y/ and /w/ as phonemic.","[45, 46]"

9It is not clear why here a second person subject prefix n- is used. Since this form was consistently
translated as a first person plural form, one would expect the form p-tat ‘our forefathers’.
This is an example of a typical sequence of verbs, involving three verbs.
There are some long pauses in this sentence. Because it was the beginning of the story, Waisafo Tenau
was a little hesitant. These long pauses in the middle of the sentence are preceded by a rising intonation,
marking that more is to follow, i.e. that the sentence is not yet finished. Other examples in this text are in
lines 6, 9, etc.
The Indonesian form terus is used regularly in Maybrat as a coordinator (see also lines 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 21,
50, 73). A corresponding Maybrat alternative is m-nan ‘afterwards’, for instance used in line 7.
It is not clear why here a masculine form is used. This may be because the referents of re-t-i ‘this’ are the
possessions of a masculine human. Other instances of re-t-i occur in line 5 and in line 30.
From here to the end of sentence 5 Waisafo Tenau speaks fast, with only small pauses between sentences.
Often when the Maybrat speak from memory they speak fast, and in a steady rhythm.
This is an instance of tail-head linkage, where the last portion of line 4, y-amo y-hu Tenau Rarir, is
repeated at the beginning of the next sentence (see §9.4.1).
The function of the repetition of Rarir is to emphasise that the ‘forefather’ lived at Tenau Rarir for a long
time (see §9.4.2). A repetition with a similar meaning, involving the verb m-hu ‘they live’ occurs in line
48.","[263, 264]"
"166Chapter 6However, the function of ora in each of the forms in (151) is different: in (151b) ora
functions as the nominal object of the verb. A property of this type of object, as was
illustrated in (147), is that it can be relativised. This does not apply to to ora in (151a), as
illustrated in the two forms in (152), which are unacceptable. In other words, to ora is not a
nominal constituent, but rather an adverbial constituent like kait ‘near’ in (148a) and u
‘above’ in (149).

other combinations of adverbials, the scope of the clause-final adverbial is over the entire
clause, and the scope of the pre-final adverbial does not include the final adverbial. A
contrast is given in example (154): forms like (154b) do occur, but they are very marked.

There are two ways to express negation, namely with the clausal negator fe and with its
predicative counterpart m-fe. These negators are discussed in §6.9.1 and §6.9.2. In §6.9.3, I
will illustrate that it is not always possible to make a clear distinction between fe and m-fe.
Section 6.9.4 discusses negation of clauses involving adverbial modifiers. I will show how
the scope of the negator can be influenced by varying the order of the negator and the
adverbial in a clause. Some examples of frequently used combinations of negators and
adverbials, such as fe fares ‘not yet’ and m-fe fi-t-o ‘if this is not the case’ are also
discussed. Finally, in §6.9.5 I will present some other forms which semantically express
negation, namely kayie and peroh.
6.9.1 Clausal negator fe
The clausal negator fe occurs in clause-final position, but see (162). Some examples:
(157)om m-ais
fe
rain 3U-descend NEG
‘It is not raining.’(158)ana m-asah fe
3P 3U-laugh NEG
‘They do not laugh.’(159)ait y-amo Kumurkek fe
3M 3M-go Kumurkek NEG
1. ‘He does not go to Kumurkek.’
2. ‘He goes, but not to Kumurkek.’(160)ait y-e
pitis
fe
3M 3M-give money NEG
1. ‘He does not give money.’
2. ‘He gives something, but not money.’In these examples, the unmarked interpretation is where the verb is negated, that is
reading 1. This is in accordance with the typological pattern of SVO-languages, in which
the negative marker is usually a verbal operator rather than a sentential one (cf. Givón
1984:336). However, an interpretation in which only the object is negated (reading 2) is
also common. If a negated sentence allows more than one interpretation, there are two
ways to resolve this ambiguity: one is to use emphasis, as in example (161), and the other
is to add an extra clause which indicates which constituent is to be negated, as in (162):
(161)ait y-e
pítis
fe
3M 3M-give money NEG
‘He does not give money (but something else).’(162)ana m-e

‘They do not give anything to him, they give it to his dog Uris.’23This is the only attested instance of a negator preceding an object in a clause.","[183, 184, 185]"

(< si ‘needle’ kis ‘?’)The forms incorporating a velar nasal all seem to be compound forms, because of the
placement of main stress (see §2.4). The velar nasal assimilates to the following velar stop
resulting in a homorganic cluster. I assume that [N] historically derives from an unmarked
subject prefix /m-/ (see §3.1 and §4.1.1) which was affixed to the second member of the
compound. A similar instance of a form with a possible remnant of an unmarked subject
prefix is [»mpair] ‘place’ in which the subject prefix and the following stop are also
homorganic. [»mpair] is possibly a spatial noun (see also §4.3.1).
Alternatively, [N] is the result of prenasalisation. Prenasalisation of stops is common in
Papuan languages (cf. Foley 1986:61–62).13

11The meaning of /a/ is unclear, but this element occurs frequently (it was found in over ninety forms) in
plant names.
12
The sap of the stem of the angkafu tree is used against cough (Avé 1998:54). Because many plant names
are syntactically compounds (see also §4.3.5), I conclude that this is also a compound, in which the first
element is isomorphous to a in angkre ‘sago leaf’.
13
Another alternative is that [N] is analysed as an epenthesised element between a vowel and a following
voiceless velar stop /k/ in compounds, since [N] in this position is completely predictable. This would
make its status the same as that of [´] between CC-clusters.
14
[N] as an allophone of /n/ only occurs in loan words, for example in [sENkçr] <Du Steenkool, as in (73).

"140Chapter 55.6 Combinations of noun phrases
In Maybrat, there are three ways of combining NPs, which I will refer to as
juxtaposition, apposition and enumeration.13 Of these, only enumeration is syntactically
marked.
Enumeration involves the placement of the enumerator o (introduced in §4.11) between
two NPs. As mentioned in §4.11, o intonationally belongs to the NP that it follows.
Depending on the context, o is adequately translated as ‘and’ or ‘or’. Some examples
appear below. In an enumeration, o on the last NP in the sequence is not obligatory, as
illustrated in (83).
(81)m-po
to-te
Saweron o
Mosun o
3U-hold LOC-direction.where.sun.sets Saweron ENUM Mosun ENUM
‘They take them along to the east, to Saweron and to Mosun.’(82)to-n-o
Aypokiar o

‘there at Aypokiar and Esuyoh, there’(83)snie eok o
tuf

fi-t-o
m-ape
moon two ENUM three again similar.to-near-U 3U-give.birth
‘Another two or three months, and she will give birth.’to-au14
ENUM LOC-DIST.U
oThe enumerator o can be replaced by a pause without a significant change in meaning,
as indicated in the following minimal pair. In example (84b) the relation between the NPs
is juxtapositional.
(84) a.b.awiah o
po
we-t-o
taro ENUM thing location.GEN-near-U
‘taro and these things’
awiah # po
we-t-o
taro
thing location.GEN-near-U
‘taro and these things’Some examples of juxtaposition were given in (71)–(73), where RCs without a head
occur one after the other. Juxtaposed NPs are not coreferential. They can be adequately
translated into English with ‘NP1 and NP2 and NP3 etc.’. Phonologically, there is always a
(short) pause between two juxtaposed NPs, marked by ‘#’:
(85)12fnia
# rae
ø-kiyam m-ama amah ø-kiyam
woman
person ø-ill
3U-come house ø-ill
‘Ill woman and men came to the hospital.’The verb -awe is used in pseudo-quotative constructions, referring, among others, to ‘thought content’.
See §8.3 and §8.3.1 for a detailed discussion of this verb.
13
Another way of combining NPs is in comitative forms, where two NPs are conjoined with the verb -sia
‘and’ or ‘with’ (introduced in §4.2.3.6). Because this NP conjoining is effected with a verbal form, I will
discuss these structures in the chapter on sequences of verbs (§8.5).
14
This is an example where the demonstrative form to-au is used as a substantive.","[157, 158]"

"6The clauseA clause is a unit consisting minimally of a predicate and its arguments. Its function is
to introduce new propositions in the discourse (Givón:1984:85). The description of the
clause in Maybrat must be centred around two criteria, namely syntactic and intonational:
syntactically, the simplest type of clause consists of a verb and its arguments and,
optionally, its (adverbial) modifiers. Given that the person prefix on a verb expresses its
subject when the verb functions as a clause, it can be assumed that a person prefix
functions as a subject argument in a clause. With the exception of the obligatory person
prefix, the arguments of a verb need not be expressed as NPs, leaving a clause which
formally consists of a single verb. This type of clause has a unique intonation pattern. This
intonation pattern is needed to distinguish between the two forms below: formally both
constitute a sequence of verbs, and could theoretically constitute a sequence of clauses.
However, they are intonationally different, which indicates that example (1a) syntactically
consists of two clauses, while (1b) consists of one clause, in which t-aut ara functions as
an object complement:
(1) a.b.t-sam
/ t-aut
ara
1s-scared
1s-climb tree
‘I’m scared, and I climb into the tree.’
t-sam
t-aut
ara
1s-scared 1s-climb tree
‘I’m scared to climb into the tree.’Examples of this type are discussed in the chapter on sequences of verbs.
In this chapter I will restrict myself to a description of ‘simple’ clauses, that is those
consisting of a single verb as predicate. The description of sequences of clauses is deferred
until Chapter 8. The present chapter is set up as follows: in §6.1, I will give the basic
syntactic structure of the clause, and its intonational characteristics. Section 6.2 discusses
the head of the clause, §6.3 the subject and §6.4 the object. Subsequently, in §6.5, nominal
clauses are presented. Topicalisation is described in §6.6. In §6.7, I will discuss
relativisation, that is the extraction of subject and object arguments from single-verb
clauses. In §6.8, the various types of adverbials that add extra information to a clause are
treated. These adverbials are collectively referred to as the ‘periphery’ of the clause. The
different types of periphery that can be distinguished are the time periphery; the manner
periphery; the aspect periphery; and the focus periphery. In §6.8.5 I will show that these
142The clause143peripheries can be combined. In the following section the location periphery is treated. In
§6.9 negation, formed with the adverb fe, is discussed. In §6.10, the clausal determiner is
described. In §6.11, I will give some examples of anaphoric reference, although this is,
strictly speaking, a discourse phenomenon, and not a clausal phenomenon.
6.1 Basic structure of the clause
The basic structure of the clause in Maybrat is given in example (2). The order of
constituents, SVO, is rigid.
(2){Time} + (Subject) s-V (+Object) + {Location/Manner/Aspect + Det}A clause always consists of a head, the verb (V) taking an overt or covert person prefix.
Subjects and objects may be expressed as full NPs, but may also be omitted if they have
been mentioned earlier in the discourse. The omission of a subject or object does not
violate the acceptability of a clause. An object normally follows the verb, but it may also
be ‘topicalised’, that is fronted, to attract the attention of the listener. Temporal adverbials
precede the verb, and may precede the subject NP, in a clause, while location/manner/
aspect adverbials normally follow the verb and, if present, the object.
A salient characteristic of clauses is their intonation pattern: on the last word of the
clause the pitch rises slightly, followed by a sharp drop. Following this sharp drop, there is
a pause.1
(3)ait y-amo Kumurkek òh
/ men
y-e
ù
/
3M 3M-go Kumurkek already tomorrow 3M-return again
‘He’s already gone to Kumurkek, tomorrow he will return again.’If another sentence follows, there may also be a rise in pitch, as illustrated below. The
same example illustrates that a fall in pitch at the end of a clause is not obligatory:
(4)y-pat
Tenau Kosetiáh / y-ama
y-hu / Tenau Kohmaró
3M-from Tenau Kosetiah
3M-come 3M-stay Tenau Kohmaro
‘He was from Tenau Kosetiah, he came to live at Tenau Kohmaro ...’/Intonation may be indicative of a differing constituent structure, as indicated in example
(5). Example (5a) contains two clauses, because there is a fall in pitch on the last syllable
of m-anes, followed by a pause. In this example, ku m-anes functions as a clause.
Conversely, (5b) contains just one clause: the only intonation break and sharp drop in pitch
are found utterance- (=clause) finally. Here, ku m-anes functions as a subject.
(5) a.b.","[159, 160, 161]"

The demonstrative prefix ti- ‘side.N’ can be attached to s-au ‘one’ to form ti-s-au ‘one

(271)ait ø-safa ti-s-au

‘The place on that side of the mountain is called Mmuk.’Syntactically, the structurally complex number terms resemble NPs, although the head
noun receives no person prefix. I will illustrate this in §5.1.4.
4.7 Adverbs
An adverb is a word that modifies or specifies an event expressed by a predicate. The
class of adverbs constitutes a closed class of words, most of which are morphologically
simple. A distinction based on semantic and syntactic criteria can be made between a
number of different types of adverbs, namely temporal adverbs, manner adverbs, aspect
adverbs, location adverbs, negators and focus adverbs. None of the lists of adverbs
presented below are intended to be exhaustive.
4.7.1 Temporal adverbs
Temporal adverbs place an event that is described in the clause in time. These adverbs
occur in clause-initial position. The following temporal adverbs can be identified:
(273)is
orie
men
ftiah
ira
iwai(n)
rere
tian
mti
tna
pose‘yesterday’
‘today, now’
‘later, tomorrow’
‘the day after tomorrow’
‘just now, previously’
‘just now’
‘later’
‘formerly, in the past’
‘night’
‘recently’
‘a long time ago’Some examples follow:112Chapter 4(274)men

‘Formerly people stabbed (=killed) the woman Ais, and they submerged her
there (in a hole).’When a time reference later than ftiah ‘the day after tomorrow’ is needed, the numerals
from tuf ‘three’ upwards can function as time adverbials, as in examples (276) and (277).
(276)tuf
ru m-api m-ama
three bird 3U-big 3U-come
‘In three days the big aeroplane will come.’(277)mat p-ehoh fane
five 1P-stab pig
‘In five days we will stab (=kill) the pig.’The marker ti ‘PAST’ can precede a numeral that functions as a temporal adverbial to
refer to a specific time span in the past, compare examples (276) and (278):57
(278)tituf ru m-api m-ama
PAST three bird 3U-big 3U-come
‘Three days ago the big aeroplane came.’The syntactic behaviour of temporal adverbials in the clause is discussed in more detail
in §6.8.1.
4.7.2 Manner adverbs
Manner adverbs say something about the way in which an event takes place. Most
manner adverbs can only modify a predicate, while others can modify an NP as well.
Therefore, a subdivision into two groups based on syntactic criteria seems warranted: the
first group constitutes manner adverbs that can only modify a predicate. Some examples
follow:57Ti- ‘side.N’ (see §4.4.) and ti ‘PAST’ are homophones which are possibly related, as in many languages
temporal decitic forms are derived from demonstrative forms (see also §6.8.1).
The element t-i in a. below is unrelated to either ti- ‘side.N’ or ti ‘PAST’. Rather, it is a contracted form
of t-imara ‘my ear’. Compare b., in which the subject is 3M. The expression -imara m-tuk ‘ears are
closed’ is common to refer to small children who do not yet understand fully what goes on in the adult
world.

clause-final position, as indicated in example (281). Some examples in a clause are:

3U-sibling.SS REL 3U-old just.now 3U-stay at.random LOC forest
‘Her older sister (mentioned) just now lives wherever (suits her best) in the
forest.’The form war ‘reject’ would semantically also qualify as a verb: however, it never
occurs with a subject prefix. Like other manner adverbs, it occurs in clause-final position,
and it says something about the way in which an event (in (282) about ‘how’ something is
put (away)) takes place. I therefore analyse it as a manner adverb.
(282)p-se
war
1p-place reject
‘We rejected it.’Two other manner adverbs are ati ‘really’ and tu ‘indeed, really, truly’. They can
modify a clause, as in (283), or a NP, as in (284). The semantic difference between these
two adverbs is not clear. They always occur in constituent-final position.

4.7.3 Aspect adverbs
Aspect refers to the internal temporal structure of an event (Foley 1986:143). In
Maybrat, aspect is expressed through adverbs. Examples of aspect adverbs are:58This form fits the structural and semantic pattern of reduplicated forms (see §3.5). However, the form nin,
which is the hypothetical stem of such a form, is unattested in the data.","[128, 129, 130, 131]"
"1IntroductionMaybrat is a Papuan language which is spoken in the central area of the Bird’s Head
Peninsula, Papua Province, Indonesia. The total number of speakers is approximately
22,000 (Brown 1991:1). Despite the fact that it is one of the larger local languages in
Papua Province in terms of numbers of speakers, a comprehensive grammar on this
language has hitherto not been published. The objective of the present study is to provide a
detailed linguistic description of the phonology, morphology, syntax and features of
discourse of Maybrat. The data for this study were collected over a period of two years in
Ayawasi, a village in central Bird’s Head.
In this chapter some background information on the language and its speakers is given,
namely a description of the geography, demography, and administration (§1.1), the history
(§1.2), the people (§1.3), the linguistic scene (§1.4), previous studies (§1.5), the language
(§1.6) and the dialects (§1.7). The final section of this introductory chapter gives an
account of the fieldwork.
1.1 Geography, demography, and administration
The Bird’s Head Peninsula called Kepala Burung in Indonesian, is situated on the
westernmost part of the island of New Guinea, between 0° and 2°20´ southern latitude and
between 130° and 134°20´ eastern longitude. The elevation of the peninsula forms a
gradual decreasing slope: the northern part is taken up by the Tamrau mountain range, with
peaks rising up to 3000 m, while the Arfak mountains constitute the eastern part of the
peninsula. In the centre the mountains rise from 800 m in the west to 2800 m in the east.
To the south of this area the land gradually drops towards the Ayamaru lakes.
Geologically, the area around the Ayamaru lakes is characterised by tropical karst
formations. The area along the MacCluer Gulf and Bintuni Bay constitutes a low swampy
area with large river systems. The entire Bird’s Head is covered in tropical rainforest and
secondary forest.
There are two major townships in the Bird’s Head: Sorong, which is the largest town,
on the north-western tip; and Manokwari on the north-eastern tip. Smaller townships are
Ransiki on the east coast; and on the south coast Bintuni (formerly Steenkool), Inanwatan
and Teminabuan. These townships are inhabited by the indigenous population, as well as
by large numbers of people from other parts of Indonesia. Also, there are a few
transmigration areas, inhabited by transmigrants from Java and other overpopulated parts
of Indonesia, outside Sorong and Manokwari. Some densely populated areas in the interior
12Chapter 1are Ayawasi (approximately 1200 inhabitants) and the area around the Ayamaru lakes
(approximately 17,000, Brown 1991:1), the Kebar plains and the Anggi lakes. These areas
are inhabited mainly by the indigenous population. Apart from the densely populated areas,
small villages, almost exclusively inhabited by the indigenous population, are scattered
throughout the peninsula. In 1985, the total number of indigenous inhabitants of the Bird’s
Head was approximated at 100,000.1
Administratively, the Bird’s Head is divided into two kabupatens (regencies): the
western half of the peninsula belongs to kabupaten Sorong, and the eastern half to
kabupaten Manokwari. These kabupatens are subdivided into a number of kecamatans
(subregencies).
Ayawasi, the site of research for the present study, falls under kabupaten Sorong,
kecamatan Ayfat. It is located in the central Bird’s Head peninsula, at 1°10´ southern
latitude and 132°27´ eastern longitude. It is located at an elevation of 450 m. The average
temperatures are between 25°C and 30°C during the daytime, and around 20°C at night.
There is 5,500–6,000 mm of rain per year: rainfall is highest in May and June, and lowest
in December and January. Ayawasi is situated at the centre of the Ayfat region.
1.2 History
The prehistory of the Bird’s Head is sketchy at best. Radiocarbon dating of
archaeological finds suggests that migrations from eastern Indonesia towards Australia and
New Guinea occurred as early as 40,000 years Before Present (BP), or even earlier
(Bellwood et al. 1998:233). It is possible that in this period the Bird’s Head peninsula was
a landing place for migrants crossing to present-day Papua Province, Papua New Guinea
and Australia (Jelsma 1998:41, refers to Birdsell 1977), but no evidence of this has been
found in the Bird’s Head. However, recent archaeological research by Pasveer in a cave
near the Ayamaru lakes revealed that human occupation in this area goes back to at least
8000 years ago (Pasveer 1998:86).2
Until well into the 20th century, the population in the Bird’s Head was seminomadic:
the inhabitants lived in gardens which were made by clearing part of the forest. If one
garden was exhausted, they abandoned it and made a new garden. In addition to gardening,
they hunted and gathered food in the forest to supplement their diet. People lived together
in clans, and made their gardens on their ancestral grounds (Schoorl 1979:22). Even today,
especially in the East Ayfat, many people still live in very small groups in the forest, and
hardly ever come to the villages.
Little is known about the history of the interior of the Bird’s Head before 1900. We
know that there were ancient trade routes between China and the Moluccan islands of
Banda and Buru. Evidence in the form of pottery, linen, porcelain, beads and certain types
of treebark (for the preparation of perfumery) suggests this trade extended as far as West
New Guinea (Schoorl 1979:21).
From 1910 onwards, attempts were made by the Dutch colonial government to create
villages in the Bird’s Head. The mission has played an important role in this, helping with
the formation of schools in new villages. In 1911 the first (Protestant) missionaries started

Both Jelsma and Pasveer worked within the framework of ‘The Irian Jaya studies: a programme for
interdisciplinary research (ISIR)’.","[17, 18, 19, 20]"
"Word classes119In this position, to is not obligatory. In example (317) a form with and one without to is
given. The semantic difference between these two forms is minimal: in the a-form, the fact
that Sorong refers to a location is specified by to, although in the b-form, it is obvious that
Sorong refers to a location from the semantic content of the object. There is, however a
syntactic difference between these two forms: in (317b) Sorong functions as a regular
nominal object, that is it can be extracted through relativisation. This is not the case in
(317a). This difference is further discussed in §6.8.6.
(317) a.y-amo to Sorong
3M-go LOC Sorong
‘He goes to Sorong.’b.y-amo Sorong
3M-go Sorong
‘He goes to Sorong.’4.8.2 Directionals
The forms u ‘up’ and tis ‘behind’ are classified as directionals. Like ete, u, but not tis,
can function as a location adverb:
(318)m-hu u
3U-stay up
‘They are above.’The form u can also modify the adverb akah ‘above’. Here, u creates emphasis. A
contrast is given in example (319).
(319) a.b.ana m-amo akah u faut
3P 3U-go above up hilltop
‘They go to the very top of the hill.’
ana m-amo akah faut
3P 3U-go above hilltop
‘They go to the top of the hill.’The forms tis and totis can function as temporal adverbials, as described in §6.8.1.
The forms u and tis can be prefixed with the location marker to to form the
morphologically complex directionals to-u ‘direction where the sun rises’; and to-tis
‘behind’. The locative adverb ete can also be prefixed with to to form to-te ‘direction
where the sun sets’. Here, the optional phoneme schwa (see §2.1.1.1) never occurs.
In each of these complex directionals, the stress is on the first syllable, for example
»to|te, »to|u and »to|tis (where ‘|’ marks a syllable boundary, see Chapter 2). Conversely, in
the type of forms discussed in the previous section, for instance, to »ta|uf ‘to the forest’, and
to »ra|puoh ‘to the forest’, the stress is not on to but on the first syllable of the following
noun. This suggests that in the latter forms to functions like a preposition, whereas in to-te,
to-u and to-tis, to functions as a morpheme in a word.
The complex directionals to-u, to-te and to-tis can function as location adverbials in a
clause. Some examples follow:120Chapter 4(320)t-amo to-u
1S-go LOC-up
‘I go in the direction where the sun rises.’(321)y-pat
to-te
3M-from LOC-below
‘He comes from the direction where the sun sets.’(322)fai
m-hu to-tis
woman 3U-stay LOC-behind
‘The woman stays behind there.’The form to-au ‘LOC-U.DIST’, but not to-f-o and to-n-o, can also function as a location
adverbial in a clause:
(323)ana m-amo to-au
3P 3U-go LOC-U.DIST
‘They go there.’With the exception of to-au, each of these complex directionals can be followed by an
NP:
(324)ana m-amo to-te
Frakron
3P 3U-go LOC-below Frakron
‘They go in the direction where the sun sets, to Frakron.’(325)ait y-hu
to-u
Meah
3M 3M-stay LOC-up Meah
‘He lives in the direction where the sun rises, in Meah.’(326)au ø-hren to-tis
amah
3U ø-sit LOC-behind house
‘She sits behind the house.’The forms to-te and to-u express the direction of the action. Compare, for instance, the
two forms below:
(327) a.b.t-amo to-te
Jakarta
1S-go LOC-below Jakarta
‘I go in the direction where the sun sets, to Jakarta.’
t-amo to-u
Jayapura
1S-go LOC-up Jayapura
‘I go to Jayapura.’The combination of ‘wo+directional’ that functions as an adverbial, analogous to (320)–
(322), or ‘wo+directional’ followed by a noun, analogous to (324)–(326), is not possible.
The complex directionals can be followed by a demonstrative form to-f-o
‘LOC-very.near-U’ or to-n-o ‘LOC-far-U’.67 The function of this demonstrative form is to
further specify the distance at which the action described in the clause takes place. Some
examples follow:
67Examples of a complex directional followed by to-t-o ‘LOC-near-U’ are unattested in the data.","[136, 137, 138]"
"3MorphophonologyMorphophonology is concerned with the phonological changes that take place when
morphemes are put together. In this chapter I will describe five morphophonological
processes that are relevant to the description of Maybrat.
The first process, described in §3.1, concerns person prefixes for verbs and inalienably
possessed nouns. Morphologically, these forms can be divided into two classes: (1) those
that take an overt person prefix, that is a prefix that is phonologically realised, and (2)
those that take a covert person prefix, that is a prefix that is not phonologically realised.
There seem to be a number of exceptions to the generalisations in (1) and (2) that have to
be lexically marked.
A second morphological process which provides arguments for the existence of a
phonological glide between two vowel sequences is the formation of interrogatives,
discussed in §3.2.
In §3.3, I will describe the omission of /a/ in certain forms after taking a person prefix,
and in §3.4 the deletion of one vowel if two vowels occur across a morpheme boundary is
discussed. Finally, in §3.5, I will briefly describe reduplication, a morphological process
which also involves some phonological change.
The forms that appear in this chapter are the phonological forms, unless otherwise
stated. Morpheme boundaries are indicated everywhere. At the end of this chapter, in §3.6,
I will give the orthographic conventions that will apply for the remainder of this work.
These conventions are based on the morphophonological forms.
3.1 Person prefixation
In Maybrat, verbs and inalienably possessed nouns (including kinship terms) can be
divided into two classes morphologically, namely a class that takes overt person prefixes,
and one that takes covert person prefixes. The information that is contained in the person
prefix refers to both person and, in the first person and in the third person masculine,
number. The person prefixes are as follows:

/m-xai/The basic rule which underlies the phonological expression of person prefixes is as
follows: all vowel-initial stems take overt person prefixes; consonant-initial stems cannot
take an overt person prefix if in the resulting form the total number of syllables exceeds
two, in which possible syllable structures are V, CV, VC and CVC (see §2.3.1, example
(27)). Recall that the epenthetic vowel schwa is syllabic, although it is not phonemic (see
§2.3.2), and is thus counted as a syllable in the rule as stated above. The implications of
this rule for different forms of verbs are discussed below.
3.1.1 Forms that take an overt person prefix
Forms that take overt person prefixes can be divided into three formally different types:
first, all forms with vowel-initial stems take an overt person prefix. The paradigm of the
verb /-isi/ ‘agree’ in (2) is illustrative of this. In these forms a person prefix is overt
because this prefix does not add an extra syllable (V) to the final form. Some examples:

‘my father’A second category of forms that receive an overt person prefix are monosyllabic stems
with a stem-initial C, namely CV or CVC. An example is the paradigm of the verb /-po/
‘hold’ in (2). Affixing of a person prefix results in a CC-cluster in word-initial position. As
pointed out in §2.2.2, these CC-clusters are broken up by an epenthetic schwa. Because the
epenthetic schwa is syllabic (see §2.3.2), the resulting form consists of two syllables:Morphophonology/y-ros/ơ ơ
