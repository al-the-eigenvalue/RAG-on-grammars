"(Uhle 1894:68.2)However, declarative -cay is also used in clauses containg a full verbal predicate
although in such cases, the tendency is to occur without it.

(Vellard 1949:169)637
It is possible that the application of declarative -cay marks an increased certainty on
the speaker's side with respect to the answer. Thus, when the speaker believes to
know the answer, (s)he uses declarative -cay, whereas in a case when the answer
cannot be anticipated by the speaker declarative -cay is missing. If this proposition is
true, then example (50) would display a lack of certainty, i.e. it is unknown to the
speaker what his / her interlocutor may want. In example (52), however, a particular
answer may even be expected (namely, that Vellard would not leave easily) and thus,
the speaker feels able to use declarative -cay in his question.
In some cases, declarative -cay and question bound topic marker -ki are
combined, which I regard as errors since these markers are generally mutually
exclusive (cf. 7.2). The answer to a yes / no question is the repetition of the verb, as
demonstrated in example (53a) and (b).
The use of certainty -kala is somewhat sinking here It may be interpreted as 'Wouldn't you like a rest?
Do you really want to go on?' but this has to remain a speculation.

(Uhle 1894:92.2)7.6 Interrogative clauses
Interrogative clauses require either a certain information (information questions) or a
positive or negative affirmation (yes / no questions). I will first deal with information
questions before turning to yes / no questions.
7.6.1 Information questions
As imperative clauses, interrogative clauses convey a low degree of certainty
expressed by the speaker and are thus not marked with declarative -coy634. Specific
markers are the interrogative pronouns themselves (cf. 4.2.5), the question marker -ta
(cf. 4.2.5.1.2), and the question bound topic marker -xwi (found only in Vellard's
data; cf. 4.2.5.1.3).

is a slight tendency for the interrogative clauses to occur without this marker (50) but
it occurs regularly in non-verbal predicate clauses of any type (51).

the marked word order may become unnecessary and other combinations are then
possible, too.

7.7 Predicate clauses
The following description of predicate clauses is based on Payne (1997:1 Uff). On
the basis of word order and morphological marking five different types of predicate
clauses can be distinguished.
7.7./ Equative predicate clauses
The first type is what Payne (1997:114) calls equative predicate clauses: ""Equative
clauses are those which assert that a particular entity (the subject of the clause) is
identical to the entity specified in the predicate nominal, [...]."" (marking by the
author). Payne further distinguishes proper inclusion640 from equative predicate
clauses, but in Uchumataqu equative predicate clauses and proper inclusion are
expressed the same way, a common feature as Payne (ibid.) points out.
In most equative predicate clauses, the predicate occurs without an overtly
expressed subject and is marked by declarative -cay (1). This makes them the
morphologically least marked predicate clauses.

"CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION5the personal clitics -/, -m, and -s, which refer to first, second, and third person,
respectively. Although their usage in the sources appears to be mainly emphatic,
there are also hints that these clitics had a person marking function in a more intact
stage of Uchumataqu. This is particularly reflected in interrogative and imperative
clauses. Uchumataqu is predominantly an SOV language but it allows great variation
with respect to word order. Interrogative devices are the interrogative pronouns and
the use of question markers -ta and -xwi; the latter is an allomorph of topic marker -ki
used in questions. In most cases, declarative -cay does not occur in interrogative
clauses, although there are some yes / no questions in which it is used. Although the
number of relative clauses is severely limited in my data, it appears that they are built
with nominalising subject relativiser -ni and are prenominai in nature, corresponding
to the basic SOV word order. The available examples suggest that relativisation in
Uchumataqu is restricted to subjects.
1.1.1 Genetic affiliation
As has been mentioned at the beginning of this section, Uchumataqu and Chipaya
(subsumed as Uru-Chipaya; cf. below) are considered to belong to an isolated
language family. However, several propositions concerning the genetic affiliation of
Uru-Chipaya have been made. Crequi-Montfort and Rivet (1925-27) suggested that
they are related to Pukina, a language mentioned by Ore (1607) that became extinct
in the 17th century. This suggestion was probably inspired by the name Pukina given
to Uchumataqu by the speakers themselves (cf. 1.3.1). The same authors (1926:121139, 1927:57-69) also brought into discussion a possible genetic relationship between
Uru-Chipaya and the Arawakan language family. However, none of these theories
could last. Olson (1964, 1965; quoted in Muysken 2001:76) proposed that (Uru)Chipaya had affinities with the Mayan languages of Meso America, a theory likewise
rejected today (cf. Campbell 1973, Adelaar and Muysken 2004). Fabre (1991)
presented an etymological vocabulary, in which he deals with Uru-Chipaya
(including Murato), the Jaqi language family, Quechua, the Pano-Takana language
family, and an Arawakan language. This approach is further developed in his article
Lexical similarities between Uru-Chipaya and Pano-Takanan languages: Genetic
relationship or areal diffusion? (1995), but so far no genetic affiliation could be
substantiated. Thus, it appears best to refer to Uru-Chipaya as an isolated language
family of the Bolivian Altipiano (Muysken 2001:76).
1.1.2 Uchumataqu compared with Chipaya
Chipaya is the only member of the Uru-Chipaya4 linguistic family that is still in use
today. It has approximately 1,800 native speakers in the communitiy Santa Ana de
Chipaya near Lake Coipasa in southwest Bolivia. Chipaya is highly endangered due
to an increasing influence of Spanish in modem Bolivian society and a shift to
Aymara. Uchumataqu and Chipaya are considered to be as closely related as French4In 2001 the Nacwn Originaria Um (NOU) was formed in Oraro and consists of several groups, who
consider themselves to be of Uru origin. However, none of them speaks a Uru-Chipaya language any
more, with the exception of the Chipaya.","[21, 22]"
"(Métraux 1935:105)4.2.5.1.3 Question bound Topic marker -xwi
According to Vellard (1967:26) -ki and -xwi are interrogative particles. The use of
-xwi is limited to the work of Vellard (1949-67) and does not occur in other
documents. Despite its uncertain origin it is clear that -xwi is not a loan from Aymara
or Quechua.
(120)culfuj tuti
am-xwi
what name you-QTP
'What is your name?' (lit: 'What name is yours?') (Vellard 1967:19)Although Vellard labelled -ki a question marker, it appears in declarative clauses, too.
Furthermore, interrogative clauses are regularly built without -ki. The same is true for
-xwi: the majority of interrogative clauses is constructed without it (tab. 4.13),
although it is worth to note that -xwi is restricted to interrogative clauses. Neither -ki
nor -xwi are attached to the interrogative pronoun itself (tab. 4.14 and 4.15). These
aspects point into the direction that none of these elements is a question marking
suffix. Instead, -ki might be seen as the topic marker.
Both morphemes show a tendency to occur on nouns and pronouns and they
appear in complementary distribution. It is the last point that gives rise to the
assumption that -xwi may well be an allomorph of Topic marker -ki. It then has to be
glossed as question bound topic marker (QTP) since its scope is strictly limited to
interrogative clauses. If -xwi is an allomorph of topic marker -ki, there has been a
For the difference between apa and ep, cf. 3.6 4197CHAPTER 4 - THE NOMINAL SYSTEMphonological shift from the plosive Ikl to a labialised fricative /xw/. What induced this
shift is uncertain but we may assume that it is at least in part due to the attrition of
Uchumataqu.
Vellard (1967) presents three examples which may be interpreted as instances of
the question bound topic marker, although their form differs from this suffix (121).
However, since these instances occur only in interrogative clauses, I propose a
reading as the question bound topic marker.

4.2.5.1 Question marking related phenomena
The following sections will be concerned with pronominal features used in question
formation. I will first describe the second person singular pronoun kun before turning
to the question marker -ta, and the question bound topic marker -xwi.
4.2.5.1.1 The second person singular kun
The form kun requires some discussion. It can be interpreted as a second person
singular pronoun and in seventeen out of 25 cases it occurs in interrogative clauses.
Vellard (1967:26) points to this: ""kù [...] an interrogative particle, which is placed at
the beginning of a phrase.""423 That is, the form kun may be interpreted as a second
person singular personal pronoun restricted to interrogative clauses (112 and 113).

"CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS159The verb classes are structurally not distinctive, i.e. every member of every verb class
can be inflected with e.g. future tense -aki. However, the verb classes select different
nominal case markers (for further discussion, cf. chapter 4).
In sum, on the basis of their functional properties verbs are not always easily
distinguished from nouns and with respect to function we find a considerable overlap
between these categories. As has been shown for nouns and adjectives there are no
clear-cut boundaries between the several parts of speech in Uchumataqu. However, in
terms of their structural properties verbs can be set apart from other word classes by
their ability to be marked for tense, apect, and mood. These concepts are encoded
verbally and are not found on any other grammatical category in Uchumataqu.
The following table summarises what has been said about the three main grammatical
categories in Uchumataqu. Shaded areas denote overlaps between categories. Please

3.6.4 Particles and phrases
The following section deals with items that do not belong to the word classes
presented above, and no feature can be established that classifies them as a category
of their own. With one exception, to be discussed below none of these lexical items
takes particular morphological marking except for personal and clausal clitics.
Furthermore, negation ana 'no, not' is the only expression that occurs in all
documents while the remaining particles appear in only one source. Therefore, they
cannot be cross-checked and verified and thus, it remains uncertain whether the itemsUCHUMATAQU THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA160in question truly form part of the Uchumataqu lexicon and how and when they were
used Based on these considerations I will present a list of the particles found in the
sources but except for a few cases will not discuss them further Negation ana will be

express positive confirmation, the sources on Uchumataqu (including Vellard) agree
on that the notion 'yes' is expressed by repetition of the verb form (cf 113a and b)

equivalent, it remains largely uncertain whether hi-lay is a regular form, under which314Uchumataqu forms alphabetically ordered Slashes denote alternative formsCHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS161circumstances it could be used, and what the difference is between hi-lay and
repetition of the verb form.
Next is isu-cay 'so, that' (Vellard 1949:151), which is probably a loan from
Spanish eso 'this, that' (cf. 2.11) and thus, we do not know whether the form ka:yaca: (Uhle 1894:2) represents the original Uchumataqu expression. Furthermore, Uhle
did not specify whether this item is from Chipaya or Uchumataqu.
Likewise uncertain is the use of sipi 'when, if, as given by Polo (1901:476).
Notions of mood and modality are usually expressed by irrealis -aca (cf. 5.8.2) and
thus, the use of a presumably unbound morpheme such as sipi appears to be striking.
It is possible that the first part is a loan from Spanish si meaning 'when, if335 but in
this case, the second element *-pi remains unanalysable. I would like to point to
Cuzco Quechua where a similar phenomenon can be observed. In this dialect,
Spanish si in its meaning 'when, if is combined with -chus which itself consists of
negation and question marking -chu and Reportative -s(i) (Cusihuamân 1976:248).
The resulting form sichus is likewise translated as 'when, if (cf. Valderrama and
Escalante 1977, Hannß 2004). However, since sipi is a single instance and its second
component remains elusive nothing further can be said about it.
Another element to be discussed is somewhat exceptional to the previous ones
since wajasiki23*' 'that's why' comprises a form -siki which can be analysed as the
locative marker (cf. 4.1.1.3). The element *waja- does not occur elsewhere and we
may assume that wajasiki is lexicalised, provided it is a regular form of Uchumataqu
at all.
Finally, Uhle (1894:113, 54.1) presents two particles related to Aymara. The
expression winaya 'always' is a direct loan from Aymara337 (DeLucca 1983:853)
while waligara, which is translated by Uhle as 'like'338, comprises the form wali
meaning 'well' or 'much' (DeLucca 1983:444). The form wali itself is used as an
adverb in Uchumataqu (cf. 6.1.4) but the element *-gara cannot be established for
neither Aymara nor Uchumataqu. The notion of comparative 'like' is expressed in
Aymara by the bound grammatical morpheme -jama (DeLucca 1983:606), whereas
Uchumataqu uses separative -kistana. Therefore, the form waligara remains largely
unanalysable. The remaining forms do not show any peculiarities or relations to other
bound or free morphemes.
In what follows, I do not interpret the term 'phrase' in its syntactic sense but
rather in a pragmatic way, i.e. as a fixed expression that serves in daily
communication. As such, these phrases form a closed set. They are not a part of
speech as are e.g. adjectives but neither do they belong to a particular clause type (cf.
chapter 7) for they are fixed and do not allow much morphological or syntactic
variation. Therefore, these expressions are treated as a final remark on the parts of
speech Uchumataqu comprises.
The majority of these phrases comes from Vellard (1949, 1951) and is thus
subject to the same source-related restrictions as are particles. Some of the phrases
It can also mean 'yes'
As a quotation, the form waja- is maintained and not adopted to the Irohito alphabet

426196UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAAlthough the database on kun is limited, it is possible to say that it occurs with every
verb class without restriction, i.e. the use of kun is not selected by specific verbs, and
thus behaves very much like am.
4.2.5.1.2 Question marker -ta
The question marker -ta requires some additional comments. In Uhle (1894), its
regular use is testified but in later documents it is found less and less. In Vellard
(1967) -ta is used only occasionally on the interrogative pronoun kasu, but otherwise
does not appear any more. In Muysken (2005) it has entirely vanished. Therefore, the
following statements are based mainly on Uhle's data.
The question marker -ta is mostly attached to the interrogative pronoun, less
often to a personal pronoun, and hardly ever to the subject of a phrase. It is not used
obligatorily, and we find a general tendency to delete the question marker -ta after
case marking suffixes on interrogative pronouns when these appear at the beginning
of a phrase (e.g. example 99) (cf. Uhle 1894:55). Accordingly, there is a tendency to
employ -ta on pure interrogative stems (119) and often the element which -ta is
attached to is not positioned at the beginning of a phrase (97). The use of -ta seems to
be reinforcing rather than purely marking an utterance as interrogative.

"(Vellard 1949:152)Since the second clause is almost a repetion, the speakers marks the repeated and thus

As an extension, topic marker -ki can be also used to mark information that is
invoked by or can be inferred from the context but not necessarily mentioned
explicitly before. The following two clauses deal with the leave taking of Vellard and
consist of a question directed to the researcher and the answer 6 "".

'To the [my] house, I will go with much grief.' (Vellard 1949:169)Although kuya 'house' has not been mentioned explicitly before, it can be inferred
from the context that 'going' here means: going home. As inferrable (or invoked)
information, it is marked with topic marker -ki. The constituent kui-kina-k[i] in (16b)
is right-dislocated, i.e. it appears at the end of the clause in a position normally
reserved for the verb. This is in accordance with Givón (1984:257), who notes that an
indirect complement usually expresses ""new, asserted information"". Thus, to

"(Métraux 1935:98)With respect to its position, ana almost always precedes the element it negates, i.e. it
appears either at the beginning of the entire clause or precedes the phrase it refers to.
Sometimes the position at the beginning of a clause coincides with the one preceding
the negated phrase (e.g. example 40). Only in one case does ana appear at the end of
a clause and there, it is used to build a tag question. Since the construction in (43) is

case, <h> would denote the most backward member in a series of <h > , < h>, and <h>.
However, even if this proposal would be correct, the exact nature of the sound in
question still remains uncertain and I am unable to provide a suitable interpretation.
2.5 Affricates
Uchumataqu has a set of two affricates, /ts/ and /tj/, which show the same pattern of
distribution.
/ts/
[ts] The dental voiceless affricate occurs word initially and in the onset of a syllable,
often occupying an intervocalic position.
(65)tsa.ta.ki.ca

(Lehmann 1929b:2)However, dental affricate /ts/ does not appear in coda position, and accordingly is
found in word final position presumably only in case of final vowel elision (cf. 66
u'ats para). It is pre-consonantally only in word initial position and its postconsonantal occurence is restricted to a few items, as example (66) demonstrates.

(Métraux 1935:93)The data on aspirated and glottalised affricates are quite limited and only seven items
with these features can be established. Only two of them do occur in more than one
source and these items do not correspond with respect to the feature in question.
Furthermore, no example of an aspirated palatal affricate *<ôh> can be provided.
These considerations would suggest that neither aspiration nor glottalisation of
affricates is an original feature of Uchumataqu. However, none of the seven

"Acknowledgements
First and foremost, I would like to express my deep gratitude to my promoter Pieter
Muysken, without whom this project would have been impossible. I am very grateful
for his never ending support and confidence in this project. He commented on every
section and chapter and his insightful and inspiring suggestions guided me through
the project, which was at times a difficult one. Whenever I approached him with
whatever difficulty I faced, I was given the feeling that nothing but the solution to my
problem mattered and he supported me in every possible way.
I am likewise deeply indebted to Hein van der Voort, with whom I was lucky
enough to share an office for a time. The entire manuscript and particularly the
chapter on phonology profited from his invaluable comments and incredible patience.
I would also like to thank Mily Crevels and Simon van de Kerke, together with Hein
van der Voort editors of this grammar. Mily Crevels and Simon van de Kerke
contributed to the manuscript with useful comments and support during the
formatting, which at times was quite challenging.
My thanks also go to Sabine Dedenbach-Salazar Saenz, who was my
copromoter in this project and the one who brought me into contact with UruChipaya. Without her very sharp eye for details, many inconsistencies and
contradictions not only in the manuscript would have gone unnoticed.
I would also like to thank Willem Adelaar for his interest in my research, his
inspiring comments on the manuscript, and his support on many other topics.
Many other people contributed to the study of Uchumataqu, either by
commenting on sections and chapters or by their helpful remarks and suggestions on
presentations: Astrid Alexander-Bakkerus, Susanne Brouwer, Hanke van Buren,
Eithne Carlin, Wolfgang Dietrich, Rafael Fischer, Rik van Gijn, Jesus Mario Giron,
Katharina Haude, Roland Hemmauer, Gertie Hoyman, Peter Masson, Sergio Meira,
Hella Olbertz, Kees Versteegh, and Otto Zwartjes. My research always profited from
their useful comments and critics. Furthermore, I would like to thank Amo Zweden,
who often was my last resort when my Dutch failed me.
I am particularly grateful to my former office mate Swintha Danielsen and to
Sonja Gipper for all the discussions we had, be they on linguistic or non-linguistic
topics. Without their opinion, advice and often enough help, things would have been
much more difficult. I hope this is the only the beginning of further collaboration.
I am also indebted to the Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin that gave me
free and uncomplicated access the invaluable manuscripts of Max Uhle and Walter
Lehmann on Uchumataqu (Uru). My thanks go particularly to Gregor Wolff, who
was very co-operative about my archive research. Furthermore, I would like to thank
Colette Grinevald, who allowed me to use her personal notes on her visit to Irohito
and provided me with interesting and useful background information on the language
situation in Bolivia.
In Bolivia, my thanks go to don Lorenzo Inda and his family in Irohito, who
hosted me and answered any of my questions, regardless whether I wished to know
something about their former language or about a trivial matter of everyday life.
Without their friendliness and hospitality, I could not have gained the insight I had inthe present-day situation of the Uru people. I am also grateful to Ciriaco Inda, who
spent his rare time with me pondering on the meaning of words and phrases. Without
Vladimir Salazar I would not have been able to meet the Inda family and I would like
to express my gratitude for his energy and unending support. Whenever I met a
problem, he tried to solve it for me and his profound knowledge of Bolivian society
was an invaluable help, not only to my research but also to my well-being. When it
comes to well-being, I am likewise deeply indebted to Trini Betancourt, who took
care for me in La Paz, treated me like her daughter, and sometimes made the
impossible possible. I also owe many thanks to the native speakers of Chipaya. Their
interest in Uchumataqu and unending patience with my questions enabled me to
comprehend Uchumataqu and its relation to Chipaya better than could have done any
book. Without their help, the film Vellard made about the Uru would be nothing but
beautiful pictures.
This is the place to thank my close friends in Bonn: Christiane, Sabine, Moritz,
Christian, and Alexis. They showed the greatest understanding for me and my
sometimes unusual situation. Without them, the years of thesis writing would have
been less happy.
Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to my grandparents for
their ever-lasting care and my mother for wanting me to be happy and for picking up
the receiver every time I called.
Any mistake and error this book may contain is entirely mine.

AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY
Uchumataqu, also known as Uru, was spoken around Lake Titicaca in the
communities of Irohito (northwestern Bolivia), Ch'imu (southeastern Peru), and in
the Bay of Puno (Peru) It is assumed that in pre-colomal times there has been an
Uru-speaking population all along the nvers of the Bolivian Altipiano and at the great
lakes Titicaca, Ροορό and Coipasa Wachtel (1986 283) named this stretch the
""aquatic axis"" Adapting to this environment, the Uru based their economy on
hunting, fishing, and gathering However, it is likely that the Uru already became
dispersed under Inca rule and matters did not improve for the Uru population when
the Spanish arrived In fact, they were forced to leave their traditional communities,
abandon their lifestyle and settle down in Aymara villages By this process, the
community of Irohito became isolated and what could be called one of 'the last
stands' of Uru culture and language Despite less favourable social, economic, and
political circumstances, the small village of Irohito managed to survive and even
maintained its language Uchumataqu Although the Uru, their particular culture and
language had been known since early colonial times, they were not documented
before 1894, when Max Uhle paid a visit to Irohito and for the first time collected
linguistic data Irohito soon became a kind of scientific hot spot (Muysken m s
2007 4) and during the first half of the 20th century, the village was visited by a
number of researchers, who recorded Uchumataqu However, a severe drought at the
beginning of the 1940's brought the end to Irohito, and Uchumataqu became extinct
around 1950 However, Irohito recovered and survived as a settlement Today, there
is a certain pnde of the inhabitants about their distinct culture Although the language
has been extinct for about half a century by now and only the knowledge of some
words and phrases remains, the Uru are aware of their ancient language, which, still,
contnbutes to the Urns' view of themselves as being different from all their
neighbours
This study is based on the efforts and results of the early researchers, who
worked in Irohito and on Uchumataqu between 1894 and 1967 Although a
considerable amount of research had been conducted during this time, only few
studies were actually published and none brought together what had been said on
Uchumataqu Therefore, the aim of this book is to provide a grammatical description
of Uchumataqu, taking into consideration every study, published or unpublished, that
is concerned with linguistic data on Uchumataqu It seeks to give an impression of
this language and its phonological, morphological, and syntactic processes and to
provide linguists from different backgrounds with a reference grammar on this so far
minimally described language Working with (in part) historic material on a language
that is not acquired by anyone any more as native language involves a certain degree
of reconstruction and makes necessary more assumptions and incertainties than
would have been the case with a language that is still spoken However, this study is
not a reconstruction in the sense that it tries to reconstruct a proto-language or the
kind of Uchumataqu that was spoken 500 years ago Rather, its purpose is to describe
the language as it has been recorded during the last 50 years of its existence and is2UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAthus a description of a highly endangered language, which, became extinct two
generations ago. It cannot be denied that material from different researchers with
different backgrounds and recorded at different stages of the language, adds new
problems to the already existing challenge of describing a dying language. Thus, in
some cases our knowledge of certain phenomena remains limited since the data do
not provide solutions and there are no native speakers left to answer questions.
To give a more detailed outline of Uchumataqu, its speakers and the research on
which the present study is based, this chapter will sketch the structure of Uchumataqu
and its differences and similarities with closely related Chipaya, before giving an
overview of the Spanish, Quechua, and Aymara influences on this language. That
will be followed by a description of the history of Irohito, its development during the
20th century, and its position at the beginning of the 21 st century, including a sketch
on the field-work I conducted in Irohito. Before turning to detailed presentation of
the sources considered here, I will comment on the theoretical framework applied for
the current study and the resulting terminology and methodology.
This introductory chapter will be followed by a description of the phonology of
Uchumataqu and its morphophonological processes in chapter 2, which I call
context-sensitive processes. Chapter 3 describes the morphological patterns that can
be observed in Uchumataqu. Then I turn to a description of the nominal system in
chapter 4. Chapter 5 concerns a presentation of the verbal system of Uchumataqu.
The following chapter 6 deals with adverbs, postpositions, and the negation particle
ana. The final chapter of this book provides a description of the clause types and
syntactic operations of Uchumataqu. The appendices contain a comparative
dictionary and transcriptions of Uhle's and Lehmann's manuscripts of Uchumataqu.
1.1 Structural overview of the Uchumataqu language
Together with closely related Chipaya (cf. 1.1.2), Uchumataqu forms the language
family of Uru-Chipaya, which is assumed to be isolated (cf. Torero 2002:466,
Muysken 2001:76). The following summary of the linguistic structure of
Uchumataqu is based on my research and the features addressed here will be further
outlined in chapters 2 to 7.
Uchumataqu phonology differs in some aspects from that of the neighbouring
Aymara and Quechua languages. Just like these languages Uchumataqu has a rather
elaborate set of plosives. However, these include aspirated, glottalised, and labialised
plosives, and word initial plosive clusters, something that cannot be observed for
Quechua or Aymara. Furthermore, Uchumataqu has some affricates and fricatives,
which do not occur in its neighbouring languages, either, such as dental voiceless
affricate /ts/ or postalveolar voiceless fricative [J]1. Another distinctive feature of
Uchumataqu phonology is the 5-vowel system with a long variant of each vowel.
However, increasing influence of Aymara (with a 3-vowel system) caused the
attrition of the 5-vowel system, as can be observed in later studies on Uchumataqu
(e.g. Vellard 1967). The tendency of Uchumataqu to allow consonant clusters is also
reflected in its syllable structure, where a syllable can have the form of CVCC orWhich does not have phonemic status.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

either a question about the instrument ('with what?') or to build the interrogative
pronoun 'why?'. It is in the latter case that we find a free alternation with separative
-kistana, which is also found on culu- to form the interrogative pronoun 'why?' (cf.
4.1.1.5 and 4.2.5). This free alternation between -stani and -kistana occurs only with
verbs that do not require a directional marker, like e.g. qaw- 'cry'. With verbs that do
require directional marking, either separative -kistana or directional -kina are used
instead of comitative-instrumental -stani (cf. 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.5).
The alternative form -toni appears lexicalised on pikil- or pukul- and cepul-tani
where it attaches to a numeral pisk 'two' or cep 'three'. The numeralpisk(i) 'two' has
been modified and appears in the form of either pik- or puk-. In this function -(s)tani
marks a unity and can be translated as 'together' or 'the two / three of. There is no
difference between pikiltani and pukultani, so they are regarded as allomorphs. The
use of pikil- /pukultani and cepultani, respectively, is restricted to human beings.
The comitative is bound to the numeral stem by means of the linking element -ul
or -/'/. The linking element does not have a meaning of its own but serves only to
connect the numeral stem to comitative -stani. The vowel of the linking element is
determined by the vowel of the stem. It is likely that especially -il is of the same
origin as the linking vowel -i that occurs between the personal pronouns of first and
second person singular and their clitic elements (cf. 4.2.1).

"(Métraux 1935:106)What is particularly remarkable is that (with the exception of Uhle and Lehmann) all
documents use both am and kun, although am is by far the more common form. What
is the origin of kun. It may be possible that it is a loan from Aymara cuna 'what?'
(DeLucca 1983:73), with which it shares an interrogative meaning. However, since
cuna means 'what?' and kun clearly denotes a second person singular 'you?', this
proposition seems only partly appropriate. Yet another possibility is that kun derives
from Aymara personal pronoun xuma*24 'you' (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981:122). In this
case, the initial fricative oïxuma would have been replaced by a stop, while the final
vowel /a/ got lost and the bilabial nasal Imi became alveolar Ini. Strikingly, Aymara
xuma is not restricted to interrogative clauses. On the other hand, it is less likely that

respect to meaning and / or phonological form. Even if we assume that kun is a native
form of Uchumataqu, it is still remarkable that the language has only one specific
personal pronoun used in interrogative clauses and not a complete set of them.
Finally, it may be possible that kun is the remainder of an older pronominal paradigm
(cf. 4.1.4), but we lack sufficient data to further pursue this claim. In sum, I cannot
provide a satisfying answer to the question of the origin of kun, but would like to
point out that it appears in Polo (1901), Métraux (1935), Vellard (1949, 1951, 1967),
and possibly in Muysken (2005). With respect to morphology, we find that kun takes
clausal clitics and nominal markers (115).

types found in declarative clauses, i.e. SOV, SV, or OV. Since the interrogative
pronoun already marks the construction as not being declarative, no particular word
order is required. As with simple declarative clauses, deviations from these types
occur but represent only a minority within the group of information questions.
Particularly in Uhle's data (1894) do we find a frequent repetition of the subject

interrogative clauses remains uncertain.",[296]
"(Lehmann 1929d:28)This leads to the question whether the use of object marker i- has to be considered
obligatory, and hence whether accompanying pronouns or person reference indicated
on the verb are merely emphatic. No hard and firm conclusions can be drawn, but it
is well possible that at a time when Uchumataqu was not yet endangered, object
marker 5- was obligatory since transitive verbs require a direct complement. In this
case, pronouns would have been used only emphatically. Its use as manifest in my
data points to a reinforcing rather than an obligatory status and in later documents
(Vellard 1950-67, Muysken 2005) first person object is marked by either pronouns
(cf. 61) or else context, i.e. OBl s- is not in use any more. However, this may be a
result of language attrition and the growing influence of Spanish. On the basis of
these considerations, I propose that object marker s- was probably once obligatory
but at the time of its documentation has to be considered merely reinforcing. As can
be seen in example (60), object marker s- is not bound to a specific tense.",[244]

variation of possessive -ci and not a combination of two suffixes.

-yoq (Cusihuaman 1976:228) and therefore is closer in meaning to Aymara -ni.
4.1.2.2 Benefactive -taki
Benefactive -taki is found on nouns and more often on personal pronouns. It attaches

it marks beneficiary (40), (41) as well as possession (42) and in both cases it is
translated as 'for'375.

"(Uhle 1894:92.2)The elision of the final stem vowel caused by inflection often makes it necessary to
reconstruct it.
Only in interrogative and subordinate clauses, as well as in chain verb
constructions do verbs appear in the shape of their stem (see also sections 5.7.3, 7.6,
and 7.8.2). Nominal stems, on the other hand, can occur without marking, as is
frequently the case with subjects and direct objects, which are only optionally marked
by topic marker -ki. The same situation is found with adjectival and adverbial stems,
particularly in attributive function, where they are often zero marked (cf. 3.2).
However, both verbal and nominal stems form the basis for further inflectional
and derivational processes, as shown in the following examples (stems bold).

criteria are a less reliable means for establishing word boundaries and thus, I will
adopt a syntactic definition of the term 'word', as provided by Anderson (1985:153):
""The units which can thus be permuted or interrupted freely by other 'words' can
therefore be taken to establish a syntactic notion of ""word."". Examples (10) and (11)

'fever (lit.: heat)'(Vellard 1951:22)As has been mentioned above adjectival states do not take nominal or adjectival
marking and thus the question arises on which basis these forms can be termed
'adjectival'. It has been outlined in greater detail in chapter 3.6.2 that their most
important function is to modify nouns. This ability places -tni I -tin marked States
close to prototypical adjectives. Please consider examples (158) and (159).

'it is a warm meal'(Vellard 1950:81)Apart from their functional properties the semantic content of adjectival states further
suggests that it is better to treat them as adjectives. That is, they express a state which
is so permanent or characteristic that it can be understood as a typical property of
somebody or something. A somewhat exceptional case is the expression katni
(Métraux 1935:102) or ka:tin (Vellard 1950:64) 'snow', which does not describe a
property but refers to a noun. It is the only instance where a -tni I -tin marked State is
translated as a noun. However, in all other cases adjectival states refer to properties
and physical properties are encoded as adjectives in Uchumataqu (please recall table
4.17). Therefore, it seems justified to consider adjectival states as a subcategory of
adjectives, although they are not inflected with predicator -kasi.
In contrast to prototypical adjectives, States marked by -tni I -tin at first sight do
not seem to form an open class. What points to a possibly closed class of adjectival
states is that (with one exception) only action and action-process verbs are inflected
with State marking -tni I -tin while other semantic verb classes are not. However,
most expressions carrying -tni I -tin are lexicalised and it is impossible to establish
the underlying verb stem. This observation suggests that derivation of adjectival
states by means of applying -tni I -tin was not productive any more at the time of
documentation, which may further explain the relatively small number of actual
instances found and repeated citations of the same form. Thus, I would like to ascribe
the small set of items and the restricted applicability of -tni I -tin to a lexicalisation
process completed before the first documentation rather than to adjectival states
forming a closed class.
4.4 The numeral system
The Uchumataqu numeral system is a decimal one, as is shown in the way of
building numbers higher than ten. Numbers up to 99 are built on the base of qhalo
'ten'. In Uchumataqu we find the following numerals:UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA208(160)ci

where possessive -ci marks possession on the possessed (cf. 4.1.2.1).

function of the possessed. Here we find the following order: ten-digit-POS(-POS).

inflected with -ci. However, possessive -ci is not attached to 20, 30, 40, etc (example
162). These are built in the way of digit-ten without taking possessive -ci.
Cardinal numbers 200 to 900 are built in the way of: digit-hundred, without
possessive -ci (164). One hundred itself is expressed as qhalo qhalo (lit: 'ten ten') or

"(Vellard 1967:14)Therefore, the most reliable means to establish noun incorporation are semantic (as is
the case with nominal compounding), i.e. the degree of lexicalisation and
compositionality. In some cases, morphological markers, such as clitics, indicate that
the item in question is not an instance of noun incorporation.
Uchumataqu hardly ever employs noun incorporation and there are indeed only
a few instances that could be interpreted as such. In comparison to the more common
nominal compounding, noun incorporation appears to be exceptional. What may beCHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS143said of Uchumataqu noun incorporation is that in most cases a direct objet is
incorporated into a (transitive) action-process verb and the resulting compounds are
verbs or nouns. The few instances of noun incorporation suggest that they are
exocentric (e.g. 39 and 40), in contrast to nominal compounding, which is mainly
endocentric. Word order is OV in all but one case. Since the number of possible
instances is limited, nothing can be said about particular semantic fields where noun
incorporation occurs.

where a subject is incorporated into an intransitive motion verb, and second, we find
a reversed order of verb and subject.
(42)picfaj hos-sa306

'smallpox'(Vellard 1951:22)In sum, I would like to conclude that noun incorporation does not seem to be a
regular means of deriving new lexical items in Uchumataqu. Whereas nominal
compounding is used frequently, noun incorporation appears to be rather occasional
and limited to a few items only. It is possible that this restriction is in part due to the
more regular use of chain verb constructions or that Uchumataqu syntactic structure
already resembles noun incorporation by not marking a direct object, which in most
cases is immediately followed by the verbal predicate. It is unlikely that the lack of
noun incorporation is due to language attrition since nominal compounding is
testified for every source.
5.5 Reduplication
Uchumataqu has two types of reduplication: partial and complete reduplication.
Partial reduplication refers to the process of reduplicating initial or final syllables as
Hyphen set by me.
The form -sa cannot be explained but it may be possible that it is an instance of declarative -cay
Hyphen set by Vellard. It probably denotes a syllable boundary and does not mark a suffix.","[159, 160]"

possibilities to express plurality, one of which is by suffixing plural marker -naka.
Furthermore, numerals, quantifiers, and sometimes personal pronouns are employed
to express plural. The several means do not exclude each other although they are
almost never used together. Uchumataqu has no dual or further subdivision of plural.
The Nominal plural marker -naka is a loan from Aymara, where it marks
plurality on nouns and personal pronouns. In Aymara plural marking is not obligatory
and the absence of the plural marker -naka does not necessarily indicate singularity.
Furthermore, -naka does not occur with numerals or quantifiers that modify the noun.
In Uchumataqu the plural marker -naka, as in Aymara, is found on nouns, and
personal and interrogative pronouns to express plurality (cf. examples 60, 61, 64, 65).
It can be followed by Topic marker -ki, declarative -cay, and case marking suffixes.
Plural -naka may also be preceded by other morphemes such as subject relativiser
-ni, but in most cases -naka is neither preceded nor followed by other morphemes.

"50UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAtranslation mine). Dates on pp. 36 and 37 point to the possibility that the data were
collected in 1942 and 1944, except for the data provided by Luis Inta, which
probably come from 1952 (Vellard 1967:34, 36, 37). However, as a footnote (Vellard
1967:36) states the prayers ""Confesión"" and ""Por la senal de la Santa Cruz"" were
recorded nearly ten years after Vellard's first field-work campaign, which, if this
were true, would have been in 1948. This does not correspond to the dates proposed
in table 1.4, for which I am unable to provide an explanation. As usually, no
information on the duration of Vellard's field-work is given.
The data consist mainly of single clauses and only in some cases do more
comprehensive sequences occur, such as question and response. The clauses are of
varying length and complexity and include imperative and interrogative clauses as
well (Vellard 1967:1-24). They are all provided with a word-by-word as well as free
translation. This section is followed by a sample of adverbs and conjunctions
(Vellard 1967:24-26) and interrogative pronouns (Vellard 1967:26). These
grammatical observations are continued by a brief overview of some suffixes, which
are called ""particles with prepositional force""122 (Vellard 1967:27, translation mine),
whose use is further exemplified by clauses (Vellard 1967:28-32). This part is
followed by some basic grammatical observations, which deal with e.g. reduplication
as a means of reinforcement or the meaning of cuki 'let us' in imperative clauses
(Vellard 1967:33). The subsequent data were provided by Luis Inta and consist of a
question and the response to it as well as of the prayers mentioned above. A footnote
to ""Por la senal de la Santa Cruz"" states that this prayer is a somewhat corrupted
Aymara version (Vellard 1967:35, footnote 2)' 23 . The article concludes with a
comparison of numerals (Vellard 1967:36, 37). The first comparison comprises
numerals 1 to 10 supplied by Manuel Inta124 compared to numerals as provided by
Posnansky and numerals 1 to 5 from Tiwanaku. The entire comparison is titled
""ancient numeration of the Titicaca region (as remembered by some old people)""125
(Vellard 1967:36, translation mine). A next comparison comprises numerals 1 to 10
from the ""Uru of Irohito""126, Chipaya, and Puquina, following Ore (1607). It is
noteworthy that the numerals given by Manuel Inta and those under the heading of
""Uru of Irohito"" are not identical, although the numerals from Irohito are congruent
with the rest of my data (cf. 4.4). Finally, numerals 1 to 10 from Aymara and
Quechua are compared. Some of the clauses published in 1967 had already appeared
in earlier works of Vellard, mainly that of 1949.
With respect to evaluation we find a situation similar to the one from 1949, i.e.
most of the data can be verified when compared to e.g. Uhle or Métraux. However, as
already indicated for 1949, the amount of Aymara loan words and grammatical
elements is higher than that in other sources and we find a certain degree of
phonological variation. The data provided by Luis Inta are hardly analysable at all.
The grammatical analysis, interpretation, and translation are only in part

analysis and interpretation are best considered separately from each other. The data
themselves are as informative and reliable as those from e.g. Vellard 1949.
Although Vellard mentions only some of his visits (cf. table 1.4), particularly
those during which he had collected linguistic data, it becomes obvious from
footnotes, etc. that he was in Irohito several times. The following table is an attempt
to summarise the dates of Vellard's visits and the sources for this information.

Table 1.4· Overview of Vellard's visits to Irohito1.4.2.6 Final remarks
Although the personal backgrounds of the researchers presented above are highly
divergent and most of them did not have any intensive contact with each other, the52UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAdata collected are consistent to a considerable degree. That is, the grammatical
materials provided by Uhle (1894) and Métraux (1935) are very well comparable and
confirm each other's results, which is also true with respect to the lexical material
collected by Polo (1901) and Lehmann (1929). It is only with Vellard's data that we
find a certain difference with regard to the results of the preceding studies, which can
be ascribed to an increasing influence of Aymara and the de facto extinction of
Uchumataqu. It is one of the tragedies of the language that the first researchers
studied Uchumataqu when it was still a spoken language, although already highly
endangered, unfortunately left hardly any information on their language consultants,
etc. Therefore, we know virtually nothing about their field trip experiences. Vellard
was the only researcher who bothered to introduce his language consultants and
provided background information on his field-work. However, Vellard visited Irohito
when the community and its language had as good as vanished. Despite these less
favourable circumstances the data found in the several documents can be regarded as
a reliable and highly informative source on Uchumataqu.
Certain restrictions have to be taken into consideration when dealing with the
sources on Uchumataqu. Although not always mentioned explicitly, we have to
assume that data collection required the use of three languages: Spanish, Aymara,
and Uchumataqu. This gives plenty of room for interference on the language
consultant's as well as on the interpreter's and researcher's parts. Furthermore, none
of the language consultants, interpreters, or researchers was a native speaker of
Spanish127.
It also has to be taken into consideration that only Uhle had professional
linguistic training, while the other researchers were either social anthropologists or
even came from completely unrelated disciplines. For them, the recording of
Uchumataqu was rather a sideline in their career, which they did not further pursue
(except Vellard)128. This leads to the observation that all researchers lived in a time
when the idea of academic research differed considerably from that of present-day
research. Even those researchers who did not have linguistic or anthropological
training considered themselves qualified to collect linguistic data, a consideration
originating in the old idea of the 'all-round scientist'. Furthermore, there were no
standards or a unified methodology for language documentation and description and
thus, every researcher used his own techniques and methodology. Particularly Uhle
was influenced by a Latin-based grammar model, which he tried to apply to
Uchumataqu. Furthermore, most researchers tried and compared Uchumataqu to
Aymara and, to a lesser degree, to Quechua, which does not yield satisfying results,
particularly with respect to the verbal system. This bias towards a standardised
(Andean) grammar model resulted in turning the language consultant's information
into what was thought appropriate by the researcher, as in the case of Uhle.
Other aspects that today would be considered inadequate are the short periods of
time spent in the language community as well as the collaboration with only one or
two persons. The average time spent in Irohito was about one week129, which is

De taal Uchumataqu werd ooit gesproken in de omgeving van het Titicacameer en
langs de bovenloop van de Desaguadero rivier, maar is rond 1950 uitgestorven. Het
onderwerp van dit onderzoek is de gemeenschap Irohito (Noordwest Bolivia). Dit
dorp was één van de laatste nederzettingen in het noorden van Bolivia waar de
bevolking Uchumataqu sprak. Het aantal sprekers is waarschijnlijk altijd vrij klein
geweest: waarschijnlijk nooit meer dan 150 sprekers. Het Uchumataqu vormt samen
met het gerelateerde dialect Chipaya de taalfamilie Uru-Chipaya. Deze wordt gezien
als een geïsoleerde taalfamilie.
Verschillende onderzoekers hebben Irohito bezocht, totdat een ernstige droogte,
gedurende de jaren 40 van de 20e eeuw, een einde maakte aan het Uchumataqu als
een gesproken taal. De Duitse taalwetenschapper Max Uhle was de eerste die
linguïstische gegevens heeft verzameld in Irohito in 1894. Hij werd gevolgd door
José T. Polo, Zenón Bacarreza, Walter Lehmann, Alfred Métraux en Jehan (Jean)
Vellard. Vellard heeft als laatste gesproken Uchumataqu opgenomen. Het door Uhle
en Lehmann verzameld materiaal bleef ongepubliceerd. Recent onderzoek in de jaren
90 van de 20de eeuw en het begin van de 21ste eeuw werd uitgevoerd door Colette
Grinevald en Pieter Muysken.
Dit boek bevat de eerste grondige beschrijving van het Uchumataqu waarbij
ieder onderzoek, gepubliceerd of ongepubliceerd, naar het Uchumataqu wordt
betrokken. Dit onderzoek is gebaseerd op de voorheen genoemde onderzoeken en de
gegevens die daarin zijn verzameld. Observaties over de huidige situatie in Irohito
werden verkregen gedurende een veldonderzoekdoor de auteur. Het veldwerk werd
uitgevoerd in Irohito.
In hoofdstuk 1 worden de sociale, geografische en historische achtergronden van
Irohito en het Uchumataqu beschreven. De genetische verwantschap binnen de UruChipaya taalfamilie wordt bediscussieerd en Uchumataqu en Chipaya worden met
elkaar vergeleken. Hierna wordt een korte beschrijving gegeven van het theoretisch
kader en de gebruikte terminologie voor de grammaticale beschrijving, gevolgd door
een overzicht van de geschiedenis van Irohito. Het laatste gedeelte van het hoofdstuk
gaat in op de studies die als grondslag voor dit boek gebruikt zijn.
Hoofdstuk 2 gaat over het fonologische systeem van het Uchumataqu. De
medeklinkers en klinkers worden eerst geïntroduceerd, waama de klanken die in
leenwoorden voorkomen worden behandeld. Dit wordt gevolgd door de presentatie
van contextgevoelige processen. Binnen deze processen komt elisie van finale
klinkers het meest voor en leidt vaak tot verdere contextgevoelige processen. De
lettergreep en het klemtoonpatroon worden gepresenteerd voordat de representatie en
orthografie worden behandeld. Ik laat tot slot zien hoe de fonemen en allofonen van
het Uchumataqu in de manuscripten worden gepresenteerd.
Hoofdstuk 3 geeft een overzicht van de morfologische processen. De termen
wortel, stam en woord worden behandeld voordat affixatie, clitische elementen,
samenstellingen, incorporatie en reduplicatie worden gepresenteerd. In het tweede
deel van hoofdstuk 3 worden de zinsdelen van Uchumataqu geïntroduceerd.
In hoofdstuk 4 wordt het nominale systeem beschreven. Het begint met een
beschrijving van de nominale markeerders en de persoonlijke voornaamwoorden vanUchumataqu Daarna worden de beschrijvende voornaamwoorden geïntroduceerd In
tegenstelling tot andere Andestalen heeft Uchumataqu een aparte klasse van
adjectieven Deze omvat twee subcategorieën kwantificerende adjectieven en
adjectieven van toestand In het laatste deel van het hoofdstuk wordt het numeneke
systeem beschreven
Hoofdstuk 5 gaat in op het verbale systeem Het begint met de markering van
tijd, die opmerkelijk is, omdat Uchumataqu alleen de eerste persoon enkelvoud in de
tegenwoordige en toekomstige tijd apart markeert, terwijl alle andere personen
ongemarkeerd zijn Na de beschnjving van tijd volgt een presentatie van de
aspectuele affixen, waarvan slechts dne werden gevonden Dit relatief kleine aantal is
mogelijk het gevolg van taalverhes en de methoden van dataverzameling Binnen de
aspectuele affixen vinden we een prefix, dat tegenwoordig is gelexicaliseerd Na een
korte presentatie van het koppelwerkwoord worden de markeerders voor subject en
object geïntroduceerd Binnen die groep vinden we een ander prefix, een
subjectmarkeerder, dat nog productief gebruikt werd ten tijde van de documentatie
Het gebruik van prefixen in een Andestaal is opmerkelijk en niet bekend van het
Aymara of Quechua De causatieve markeerder wordt kort beschreven voordat de
nominahsatie- en onderschikkingsmarkeerders worden behandeld De begrippen van
modus en modaliteit worden geïntroduceerd in de daaropvolgende sectie In het
laatste gedeelte van het hoofdstuk wordt het validatieve suffix besproken
Hoofdstuk 6 gaat in op bijwoorden, postposities en het negatiepartikel In
Uchumataqu worden temporale en ruimtelijke bijwoorden en bijwoorden van wijze
gecodeerd als zelfstandige naamwoorden, terwijl bijwoorden van graad en
bijwoorden die bijwoorden en adjectieven modificeren, zich gedragen als
adjectieven In het daaropvolgende deel worden de postposities behandeld Daarna
wordt het negatiepartikel gepresenteerd Uchumataqu heeft een negatiepartikel, dat
woorden, constituenten en hele zinnen ontkennend kan maken
In hoofdstuk 7 worden de verschillende zinstypes van het Uchumataqu
beschreven Het hoofdstuk begint met een presentatie van clitische elementen,
waarvan de persoonlijke chtica uniek zijn in het Andesgebied Het volgende deel gaat
over de basale zinstypes declaratieve, imperatieve en vragende zinnen Daarna
worden predicatieve zinnen geïntroduceerd Dit wordt gevolgd door een behandeling
van complexe zinnen nevengeschikte zinnen, complementszinnen, adverbiale zinnen
en relatieve zinnen

van de materialen van Uhle en Lehmann bevat, is beschikbaar op de website van de

Curriculum Vitae
Katja Hannß has studied Americanist studies. General Linguistics, and Archaeology
at the University of Bonn (Germany) and received her master's degree in 2004 Her
master's thesis is an investigation of the use of the evidential suffixes in the Quechua
of Cuzco Between May 2005 and December 2007 she was a research assistant of the
DobeS project ""Uru-Chipaya"" From January 2005 to September 2007 she was a
doctoral student at the linguistics department of the Radboud University NijmegenThis book is the first comprehensive grammatical description of Uchumataqu, the lost
language of the Uru of Lake Titicaca in northwest Bolivia. Uchumataqu forms part of
the isolated Uru-Chipaya language family, which was influenced to different degrees
by Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish. The Uchumataqu language became extinct around
1950 and although several researchers had documented the language during the first
half of the 20th century, their results were never considered in a comprehensive
context. Some of the more substantial studies remained unpublished.
This grammatical description is based on previous publications and archival
materials and provides the most complete treatment of Uchumataqu to date. The
study also comprises a detailed description of the data source situation as well as
a thorough introduction to previous research that resulted in the database for the
present book. In addition, it contains a description of the phonological system and
the morphological processes of Uchumataqu. The nominal and verbal systems are
discussed in detail. Particular attention is paid to the complex person-marking system,
of which the person-marking clitics distinguish Uchumataqu from the neighbouring
Aymara and Quechua languages. Other important topics are nominalisation and
subordination strategies and the existence of a separate word class for adjectives.
The relationship between Uchumataqu and the surrounding Aymara and Quechua
languages is described in detail.
This book will appeal especially to historical linguists, typologists and Andean
linguists, but it should also interest anthropologists, Americanists, and linguists in
general. In addition to its academic value, this book is a physical record of the extinct
Uchumataqu language for the descendants of its speakers.
The author Katja Hannß studied Archaeology, Americanist studies and
General Linguistics at the University of Bonn. From 2005 to 2007 she was a research
assistant with the DobeS project ""Uru-Chipaya"" and a doctoral student at the
linguistics department of the Radboud University Nijmegen.","[316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325]"
"(Vellard 1967:9)According to Payne (1997:233), this construction may be a verb-verb compound
which he defines as follows: ""[...] both roots are recognizable verbs in their own
right, but nothing can come in between them, and the meaning of the whole structure
is 'bleached', i.e., slightly different from the combination of the lexical meanings of
the two roots [...]."" (marking by the author). Although the database on this
phenomenon is limited, the first two requirements can be regarded as fulfilled, i.e.
both roots are verbs in their own rights and their combination is not split up by other
components. With respect to the last requirement, we have to rely on the translations
656Métraux added in parentheses 'wiéi sus""1' Since the nature of this comment is uncertain, it is not dealt
with here
*"" Since 'to rest' is an intransitive verb, object marker -« may suggest a reflexive meaning here289CHAPTER 7 - CLAUSESoffered in the sources which do not suggest a change of meaning. Thus, within this
possible compound, the verb forms are not translated any different from a
complement-verb construction. Thus, constructions as in (91) stand somewhere in
between complements and verb-verb compounds and I view them as a subcategory of
the chain verb constructions.
Finally, I would like to add a note concerning the difference between
complements marked by action nominaliser -s(i) and chain verb constructions. Both
means show a certain similarity in that they are used for complementation and almost
always occur with pek- 'to want' as the matrix verb. Thus, the question of their
difference in meaning arises. Since the database is not extensive and for most cases,
we lack a context, the following has to be regarded as speculative. We may assume
that the missing marking of complement verbs in chain verb constructions conveys
the idea of a greater semantic integration into the matrix than is the case with -s(i)marked complements and it may be possible that zero marked verbs then denote a
permanent or long-standing wish or desire in contrast to complements inflected with
the action nominaliser. If this assumption is correct, then e.g. (84) could be
understood as a permanent refusal to drink, i.e. the person never drinks, while e.g.
(87) denotes a momentary wish. This hypothesis is further supported by the use of the
temporal adverb hase 'now' in (87).
7.8.3 Adverbial clauses
In what follows, I will discuss adverbial clauses, which ""modify a verb phrase or a
whole clause. [...] The kinds of information embodied in adverbial clauses are the
same kinds of information expressed by adverbs, [...]."" Payne (1997:316f). On this
basis, five types of adverbial clauses can be established for Uchumataqu:
Clause type
time
simultaneous
conditional
manner
purposeMarker
-na
-ku
-(t)xani
-ni
-xapaTable 7.1 : Adverbial clauses in UchumataquFollowing Thompson and Longacre (1985:172) I will discuss as typical devices of
adverbial subordinate clauses: ""(a) subordinating morphemes (b) special verb forms
(c) word order"".
The following statements are valid for all types of Uchumataqu adverbial
clauses. Both the matrix as well as the adverbial clause show an unmarked
declarative word order in principle, i.e. SOV (although rather exceptionally), SV, or
OV. This is possible since there is an overt marker signaling the adverbial function of
an expression inflected with any of the markers shown in table 7.1. The use of
The authors (1985 177) also divide adverbial clauses into those that can be substituted for by a single
word and those that cannot. This criterion is impossible to verify for Uchumataqu due to the condition of
the data. Thus, these two subgroups will not be part of the following discussion.","[305, 306]"

Furthermore, Uhle's manuscript also contains some notes concerning his journey,
and anthropological observations. They are considered for the current work only to a
minor degree.
-a list of the clauses he collected in Irohito and Huachacalla66 (30 double pages)
a word list comparing Uchumataqu and Chipaya (six single pages)
another word list where Uhle compares his data to those collected by Polo67,
with a Spanish translation; personal notes by Uhle (24 single pages)
a comparative word list labelled 'Uro and Puquina', but which actually contains
an Uru-German vocabulary (9 pages)
a brief word list Spanish-Atacamefio with some notes by Uhle (three pages)
a list of words and clauses from Chipaya (24 single pages)
some notes and preliminary grammatical interpretations; possibly in preparation
of the grammar (23 single pages)
detailed notes on his journey, personal experiences, as well as anthropological
and archaeological observations (all in all 77 pages)
grammatical relations between Quechua and Aymara (one page)
catechism ('Doctrina Cristiana') in Aymara and Spanish (17 double pages) ""We find personal notes and comments made by Uhle throughout his manuscript.
Some of them were clearly made while collecting the data, whereas others were
probably added afterwards. They enable us to get an insight into the way Uhle
obtained and treated his information, something he himself does not further specify.
Thus, Uhle reports the expression tsi: wa.sa 'once' but remarks: ""The Indian gave me
tsi u.nu, but u.nu is probably Spanish WHO!""68 (Uhle 1894:33, translation mine). That
is, Uhle does not use the expression his language consultant provided but what he

66CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION33considered to be appropriate. It is not unlikely that this happened with other entries,
too, even if Uhle does not mark them as 'corrected'. A similar process can be
observed with the use of parenthesis, as e.g. on -kin(a) 'to, towards' (Uhle 1894:11).
Although Uhle does not explain when and why he uses parenthesis, it is likely that
they mark elements that were not realised due to e.g. elision but which Uhle
considers to be necessary.
When it comes to an evaluation of the manuscript, we have to take into
consideration that Uhle spent only a short time in Irohito, worked only with one
language consultant, whose background remains unknown, he probably needed an
interpreter speaking Aymara and Spanish, and possibly changed some of his data to
what he considered appropriate. However, despite these restrictions Uhle's work can
be regarded as one of the most important documents on Uchumataqu. Not only was
he the first researcher ever to collect any linguistic data, but he also documented
Uchumataqu when it was still a spoken language, although already endangered. His
description of the nominal and pronominal system is supported by following works
and even modem studies on the closely related Chipaya (cf. Cerrón-Palomino 2006)
confirm his findings. In conclusion, Uhle's manuscript contains highly valuable
information on Uchumataqu.
1.4.2.2 José T. Polo (1841-1918)
José Toribio Polo was bom in Ica in 1841 and went to Lima to study history at the
Convictorio de San Carlos and the Seminary of Santo Toribio but never completed
his studies there69 (Dager Alva 2000:147, footnote 48). Beside other occupations, he
worked at the Archive del Cabildo eclesiastico, the Tribunal de Cuentas, and the
Biblioteca Nacional, of which he was subdirector (Dager Alva 2000:137, footnote 3).
Polo died in Lima in 1918.
According to Polo's profession the introduction to his work Indios uros del Peru
y Bolivia (1901) contains a detailed compilation of notes on the Uru in historical
sources, including a comparison of the historical representation of Cunza, Puquina,
and Uru (pp. 445-455). Since at that time Uchumataqu was considered to be identical
with or related to the historical Puquina mentioned by Ore (1607), Polo provides a
comparative word lists of Puquina-Uchumataqu-Spanish, which consists of twenty
items and includes the numerals 1-10 (p. 456). This list is followed by a Puquina
version of the Lord's Prayer (p. 456). Polo also adds a brief comparative word list
Atacameno-Uchumataqu of only seven items (p. 457). The following etymological
discussion of the name 'Uro' (p. 457) as well as some anthropological considerations
(pp. 459-463) are also dominated by historical considerations. These aspects make up
more than half of Polo's work on the Uru.
The Uchumataqu-Spanish word list (pp. 464-479) itself consists of about 300
words, which are ordered according to the Spanish alphabet. It comprises nouns of
As Dager Alva (2000.147) points out, at this time historiography was not a subject with an academic
tradition and it still lacked a unified methodology. Correspondingly, Dager Alva (2000:135) describes Polo
as belonging to a ""generation of historians in transition between an amateur-like history and a more
professional one""69. Regardless of these restrictions, Polo can be characterised as a historiographer and his
first and foremost field of activity was history34UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAseveral semantic fields, e.g. kinship terms, body parts, clothing, domesticated and
non-domesticated animals as well as natural and religious phenomena, personal
pronouns, and numerals. The list further contains directions, adjectives, colour terms,
and verbs of every class. Polo adds footnotes that either explain in greater detail a
particular word or point to the Aymara or Quechua origin of the item. The author also
provides a list of fourteen Spanish loan words (p. 478) and about 30 phrases (p. 478479), which he considered to be of frequent use. They include the questions for food,
one's name, and one's well-being. Polo concludes his article with some brief remarks
on his spelling of Uchumataqu lexemes and some basic grammatical observations on
compounding, personal pronouns, numerals, adjectives, the negation ana, and kinship
terms. He also provides basic notes about the verbal tense system, adverbs, and the
agglutinative character of Uchumataqu (pp. 479-482).
It is noteworthy that Polo does not use a particular phonological transcription
system but represents the Uchumataqu items by using the Spanish alphabet. The only
adaptation is that [kk], [pp], and [tt] are employed to ""reinforce the sound and also
distinguish certain words""70 (Polo 1901:480, translation mine).
Polo remains vague about the circumstances under which he collected his data.
He mentions a small vocabulary by Augusto Benavides (Polo 1901:464), which he
used to compare it to his own data. Polo ascribes differences to either dialectal
variation or to a certain ""confusion on the Urus' part for being questioned in
Aymara""71 (Polo 1901:464, translation mine). It remains uncertain whether Polo
refers to Benavides' language consultants, who were confused for being questioned
in Aymara, or his own. In case he refers to his language consultants, it is still
unknown whether Polo spoke Aymara sufficiently to communicate directly with the
Uchumataqu speakers or whether he relied on an interpreter. Further, Polo does not
specify who his language consultants were, but since he uses a plural form when
refering to them he must have worked with at least two speakers. Polo was
accompanied by Javier Gonzalez del Valle, a professor at the Colegio National in
Puno, and Enrique Gamero, likewise a resident of Puno. The latter contributed to
Polo's article by collecting data in the villages of Ancoaqui and Ahuallamaya (Polo
1901:463). Polo (ibid.) also expresses his thanks to Victor R. Cavinos, who left him
some words and phrases of Uchumataqu. Since both Gamero as well as Cavinos are
Spanish surnames, it is unlikely that they were native speakers of Uchumataqu and
therefore Polo's article does not only comprise his own data but also those of other
researchers, which, however, is not indicated in the word list itself. Thus, it remains
entirely unknown whom Polo worked with, whether he had an interpreter, and which
of the data result from his own field-work and which do not.
However, Polo (1901:463) mentions that he visited the Lake Titicaca region in
February 1897 to collect his data, which then were published four years later. He
does not further specify the duration of this trip but since Polo (1901:463) refers to it
as ""una ràpida excursion"", it must have been a rather short time. For all we know this
was Polo's only visit to the Uru, at least for linguistic purposes. We do not know of""Las letras kk, pp, /ƒ, son para reforzar el somdo, y distinguir asi algunas palabras "" (italics by author)
""[...] pueden provenir de equivocación de los indios al ser preguntados en aimarâ ""CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION35which kind Polo's relationship to his language consultants was, but it is remarkable
that he characterises the Uru as remaining in their ""primitive state"" and points out
that the Spanish conquerers could oppress them only by work and taxes (Polo
1901:459, 460). This description shows that Polo was not only influenced by the
picture of the Uru as presented in historical sources but also by the general idea of his
time that there is a constant progression from primitive to less primitive to civilised
human communities72 (cf. Dager Alva 2000:138).
For an evaluation of Polo's data, we have to take into consideration that Polo's
language consultants and their personal backgrounds remain unknown as does the
exact duration of Polo's apparently brief stay with the Uchumataqu speakers.
Furthermore, we do not know whether Polo needed an interpreter. Finally, his article
contains data other than his own, but it is not indicated which these are. However, the
lexical material presented by Polo is mainly congruent with that of other researchers,
although similarities are sometimes difficult to establish due to Polo's uncommon
spelling. The phrases, clauses, and verbal paradigms hardly ever agree with those of
other sources. It happens frequently that Polo reports a feature which other sources
do not mention or else a particular feature is similar in all sources except for Polo.
That is, Polo's phrases, clauses, and paradigms can be hardly verified and thus, his
grammatical material is only in part reliable.
1.4.2.3 Walter Lehmann (1878-1939)
Walter Lehmann was bom on September 18lh 1878 in Berlin and began to study
medicine at the University of Greifswald in 1898 (Riese 1983:311), but pursued his
career as an anthropologist rather than a doctor73. Between 1907 and 1909 Lehmann
paid a first visit to Mesoamerica and received a doctoral degree in Americanist
studies in 191374 and the qualification for lecturing at the university in 1914 (Riese
1983:313). After further research in Mexico and Guatemala (1925/26), Lehmann
visited South America in 1929 and 193075. One result of this field trip are the
manuscripts on Uchumataqu described below. Walter Lehmann died in Berlin 1939.
Lehmann left four manuscripts on Uchumataqu, which are:
-a fair copy of the manuscript from Ancoaqui (Lehmann 1929b)76
the original manuscript from Ch'imu (Lehmann 1929c)
a fair copy of the manuscript from Ch'imu (1929d)
a comparative word list Ch'imu-Ancoaqui ( 1929e)It is to say that similar statements are found in most works of that time, including e g Uhle's
manuscript presented above.
73
Although in 1901 he started attending classes on Amencan cultures taught by Eduard Seier, Lehmann
qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1903 However, in the same year he began to work as a trainee at the
Volkerkunde Museum in Berlin (Riese 1983 312) and in 1910 he became a curator at the Königliches
Volkerkunde Museum in Munich.
74
The work he wrote for this purpose is titled Amerikanische Sprach-Volks- und Altertumskunde and was
published in Munich in 1920. One year later, these efforts made him director of the Ethnologisches
Forschungs- und Lehrinstitut hei den Staatlichen Museen in Berlin.

XThus, at first sight it seems doubtful whether Uchumataqu has a system of aspirated
and glottalised sounds at all, or whether these are due to the language's increased
contact with Aymara (cf. Cerrón-Palomino 2006:39, footnote 4)149. However, there
are a few pairs of words that are found in different works and which display the same
phenomena (with respect to aspiration and glottalisation).

(Métraux 1935:96)These words are not loans and show the features in question. Thus, it is justified to
propose that Uchumataqu has a system of aspirated and glottalised plosives of its
own. However, the majority of all aspirated and glottalised sounds occur only in the
work of one author, which means that they cannot be cross-checked. Therefore, a
certain amount of uncertainty remains. It should be noted that aspirated and
glottalised plosives are more restricted with respect to the positions they can occur in
than their simple counterparts.

A similar observation has been made by Willem Adelaar (personal communication) He proposes that
the features of glottalisation and aspiration may spread from one language (providing language) into
another language (borrowing language), where they eventually may receive phoneme status.

Thus, these sounds are restricted to a word initial position, which is the most
common one, or else a position in a syllable onset
2 2 2 Labialised plosives
Before turning to the descnption of labialised plosives, some remarks on their
symbohsation in the sources are in order The modem IPA symbol designating
labialisation is Λ/ but the data are not homogeneous with respect to the symbols used
Lehmann (1929b, d) uses <tua>, <kua>, <kue>, and <kui>154 to mark labialised
alveolar and velar plosives Métraux (1935) employs <kw> to represent labialisation
Vellard (1949-51) uses <w> as well as <w> but is not always consistent, and uses
<'çkwa-cay> as well as <'çkwa-cay> 'to go', and <k""asi> as well as <kwas> 'water'
In the case of < 'okwa-cay>, the spelling has to be regarded as an exception'''5, which
is also the case for <kwas>, which is normally transcribed as <£Ma.s/> Despite these
inconsistencies, I consider both <kw> and <kw> as marking labialisation It is
noteworthy that in Vellard (1967) no <kw> occurs but labialisation is expressed by
<kw> which may be due to the editing process
Uchumataqu regularly labiahses velar plosive ßd but this process occurs only
exceptionally with alveolar /t/ No examples of labialised plosives other than these
can be established/r/

However, this is the only example for this kind of use:
(33)s-kworp'.-cay'(s)he cuts'(Vellard 1949:154)2.2.3 Initial plosive cluster
Uchumataqu has a tendency to have the word initial plosive cluster /tk/.
/tk/[tk] Dentalisation of the initial velar sound is found in the material of Uhle (1894),
Lehmann (1929b), Métraux (1935), and LaBarre (1941).

'wooden hook used in balsa making' (LaBarre 1941:517)It is somewhat uncertain whether dentalised initial velar /tk/ should be treated as a
phoneme. The example suggests that 'to work' and its derivations regularly display a
dentalisation of the initial sound, which points in the direction of a phonemic status
of /tk/. However, LaBarre provides only this single example, Lehmann has one only
more word showing the same feature, whereas Métraux mentions 11 examples of an
initial dentalisation, but the feature is entirely missing from the other sources158.
Therefore, according to my criteria for establishing phonemes, /tk/ should not be
regarded as having phonemic status, but it is clearly more than a Occasional
allophone'. It is likewise noteworthy that /tk/ occupies the same position as /t""7.
Based on these considerations, I tentatively assign phonemic value to /tk/ but also
point out that the data do not provide entirely satisfying support for this claim.

(1894) is the only one who mentions [tg].

that reduplication of possessive -ci is lexicalised since every word bearing
reduplicated -ci has a basic, non-reduplicated form Furthermore, reduplication of -ci
is exceptional since in the majority of all cases, the marker is not reduplicated Thus,
the function of this reduplication type is not entirely clear but it is possible that it
denotes a very close and possibly inalienable kind of possession If this assumption is
true, reduplication of -ci could be considered to be augmentative in function

supported by its use on numerals (cf 4 4) Vellard (1951 17ff) reports the
reduplication to appear on every numeral higher than ten (cf example 76)
In conclusion, I would like to state that reduplication must have been a fairly
productive means of stem modification once, but lexicalisation has often obscured its
meaning This is particularly the case with verbs However, with adjectives, nouns,
and pronouns some regularities can be detected Adjectives mainly reduplicate their
initial syllable and due to their semantics convey only an augmentative meaning,
whereas nouns and pronouns show partial or complete reduplication In contrast to
adjectives, nominal reduplication can have the function of plurality but only with
complete reduplication
3 6 Parts of speech
According to Payne (1997 32, bold marking by the author), ""grammatical
categories are called 'parts of speech'"" or are sometimes also referred to as ""lexical
categones"" The lexical content of an Uchumataqu word is sometimes hard to grasp
due to diverging or even missing translations Therefore, I will classify Uchumataqu
categones primarily on the basis of their structural and functional properties, ι e
according to their morphosynatctic behaviour Pursuing this approach the following
parts of speech can be established nouns, adjectives, and verbs Two somewhat
special cases are particles and so-called phrases, ι e fixed expressions found in
everyday life's communication Particles do not form a word class of their own but
do not belong to another word class either Phrases, even less than particles, do not
form a grammatical category but will be treated here as a final remark on
Uchumataqu parts of speech They differ syntactically from prototypical noun or verb
phrases and clause types and thus will not be considered in chapter 7
Although it is well possible to establish three grammatical categories the
boundanes between them are not always clear-cut (cf Schachter 1985 6, Payne
1997 32) These overlaps are observed for other languages too and go as far as to
bring into question the traditional distinction between the different categories (cf
Croft 2003 183)
In what follows, I will use the terms 'grammatical category' and 'parts of
speech' alike to refer to the Uchumataqu categones Further, I would like to point out
that for the subsequent outline of the classification of Uchumataqu parts of speech, I
roughly follow Schachter (1985) and Payne (1997)UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA1503.6.1 Nouns
Notions most typically associated with nouns are time-stability (Payne 1997:33) and
referentiality (Croft 2003:185) to ""persons, places, and things"" (Schachter 1985:7),
the latter concepts considered to be prototypically encoded by nouns.
Payne (1997:33)3'5 lists as functional properties of nouns their ability to act as the
head of noun phrases, to serve as either subject or object of a clause, and to be most
commonly the topic of texts. The head of a noun phrase can be characterised as ""the
one word within the phrase that refers to the same entity that the whole phrase refers
to"" (Payne 1997:33) (cf. 77).
(77)co:k lu.si
big
jar
'abigjar'(Métraux 1935:94)Example (77) is about ajar, not about co.k 'big', which only specifies the type of jar.
That is, the phrase itself refers to lu.si 'jar', but not to co.k and therefore, lu.si is the
head of the phrase.
Another function of nouns is as predicates and as such, no particular marking or
copulative device is required. Please consider (78).
(78)paya
koya-cay
adobebrick house-DEC
'This is an αί/oèe-house (= a house made from adobe bricks).'
(Vellard 1967:7)The role of a predicate is usually reserved for verbs. When nouns are used as
predicates without particular marking, the distinction between nouns and verbs
becomes blurred316.
Despite this overlap between verbs and nouns, the latter can be set apart by their
ability to function as the subject of a clause (examples 78 and 79).

<é> and defines as ""prepalatal fricative (voiced German ch)'172 (translation mine).
This description refers to the so-called ich-Laut which should be represented as [ç],
i.e. as a voiceless palatal fricative. However, Vellard (ibid.) assigns this quality to
<K> (see above). No instance can be found where Vellard actually uses <é> as a
fricative but all contexts suggest a simple vowel reading (cf. 59).
(59)ha.na séls.-asul -cay 'we do not exist' m(Vellard 1951:33)/h/
[h] Although it is used in all sources174, only a few provide an explanation of the
symbol <h>. Lehmann (1920:9) describes it as an aspirated fricative and Vellard
(1949:150) points out that it is always voiced. It is likely that this characterisation is
valid for Vellard's other publications as well (1950, 1951, 1967). On the basis of
these descriptions, I label Ihl as a voiced glottal fricative. However, the context of its
usage suggests that it may resemble a palatal or velar fricative, since e.g. Métraux
(1935:95) transcribes 'tomorrow' as either haka or xaka (cf. Huayhua Pari 2001:76
on Aymara /h/; Cerrón-Palomino 2006:50 on velar fricative /x/).
Sources between 1894 and 1935 demonstrate only a word initial position of/h/,
and it is only in Vellard's data that l\\l occurs elsewhere. Example (60) shows its
word initial position.

in a syllable coda, and only once word finally. It can occur pre- and postconsonantally without constraints. Example (61) shows its distribution in Vellard's

(Vellard 1949:164)[h] The symbol <h> appears only in Lehmann's (1929) and Vellard's (1950, 1951)
data but no explanation is provided and thus, any description must be based on
external sources. Schmidt (1907:832) labels it a pharyngeal sound. This is in
accordance with Lehmann (1920:9) who further specifies it as voiceless. Meillet and
Cohen (1952:xiii) agree on that <h> is voiceless but elsewhere call it laryngeal.
However, in the modem literature (e.g. Clark and Yallop 1995:423) the term
laryngeal is used differently and cannot be understood as voiceless. I therefore
choose the term pharyngeal and label <h> as a voiceless pharyngeal fricative [h]. [h]
occurs only eight times in the data, and half of these items originate from Aymara.
The remaining four items include two expressions that belong to the semantic field of
fire and the word hiuk'i 'light' (Lehmann 1929d:10) cannot be verified for sources
other than Lehmann's. This leaves three expressions containg [h] (see example 62)
where it occurs either in a syllable coda or word finally.

(Vellard 1951:22)
(Lehmann 1929b:7)It is possible that the word final use of [h] is conditioned by the preceding uvular
fricative [χ], which causes a rather pharyngeal than glottalic realisation. This may be
true for the word for 'fire' and its derivations as well, where the following velar
plosive or palatal affricate, respectively, may be the cause of a pharyngeal perception.
On the basis of these considerations, it seems justified to ascribe [h] allophonic
status, with its occurence restricted to coda or word final position conditioned by a
velar or palatal environment.
In Vellard's data a certain amount of variation occurs concerning the word for
'fire'. Example (63) demonstrates not only metathesis but also shows that within one
source the choice of glottal [h] or pharyngealised [h] varies (please compare example
62 to example 63). No other sources provide similar evidence.","[91, 92]"
"(Uhle 1894:68.2)As can be seen from the examples (28-30), terminative -kama expresses two temporal
concepts (as it also does in Aymara and Quechua), which are considered distinct in
Indo-European languages. First, it describes the notion of 'until', i.e. an event with
some (unknown) starting point, but with a fixed end point from where on another
event takes place. 'During' and '(mean)while' rather mark two events being parallel
for at least some time; starting and end point are of no importance here.
With regard to vowel elision or other processes of deleting phonological segments we
hardly find any evidence for that with terminative -kama whereas most Uchumataqu
morphemes show a relatively great range of phonetic reductions e.g. -ki for Allative kina or -stan for separative -kistana. A possible explanation might be the status of
terminative -kama as a borrowed morpheme.
In Aymara the suffix has two different shapes: -kama and -kam, depending on
the number of syllables in the root (Hardman et al. 1986:217, Huayhua Pari
2001:258f). Since Aymara as the providing language offers only the forms of -kama
and -kam the borrowing language Uchumataqu maintains them and does not show the
usual reduction in phonetic shape (to e.g. *-ka).
(31 )aka-wins-kamfaj

"(Muysken 2005:26)As indicated in the glosses, (-)paca has been analysed here as meaning 'place' (Lira
1944:720), i.e. as a noun. Thus, it is probably a loan from Quechua since in Aymara,
paca is restricted to a temporal meaning (DeLucca 1983:328). According to the
translation, it may be possible to analyse the element siq- as being an alternative form
ofasqi 'faraway'.
Together with temporal adverbs, spatial adverbs form a nominally encoded
subclass of adverbs and are conceptually close, as can be seen from forms used both
in a temporal and locational / directional sense.
6.1.3 Adverbs of manner
In most languages, manner adverbs form the largest group of adverbs. However, for
Uchumataqu only a comparatively small number of manner adverbs can be
established which may be due to the documentary situation. Among these adverbs are
asta and loaloa both meaning 'quickly', untu 'hard, strong', and ina 'in vain'. In
contrast to the adverbial subclasses discussed above, manner adverbs are combined
with adjectival morphology, i.e. predicator -kasi (13) and they take clausal clitics,
such as declarative -cay or affirmative -pini (14).

"6UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAand Spanish (Muysken 2001:77), although the exact kind and degree of their
relationship still has to be explored.
It has become common usage to refer to the variety of the Titicaca region as
Uru, whereas Chipaya denotes the variety spoken in southwest Bolivia close to Lake
Coipasa. For further discussion of the denominations Uru and Uchumataqu, cf. 1.3.1.
Both varieties are structurally close to each other and with respect to phonology,
we may say that Uchumataqu and Chipaya are almost identical (at least from what
can be judged from the phonological information on Uchumataqu given in the
sources). However, with regard to morphology, Uchumataqu has certain morphemes
that do not occur in Chipaya, either because Uchumataqu preserved an older stage of
the language due to its isolation or, alternatively, Uchumataqu developed these
morphemes after its split from other Uru-Chipaya. These morphemes, then, are
unique to Uchumataqu. Among these unique morphemes are possibly the personal
pronoun of second person singular kun 'you', which appears to be restricted to
interrogative clauses. Another pronominal form is -wici, which can be described as
an original pronominal plural marker that was used to build niwici 'they' before
Aymara plural marker -naka took on this function. Morphemes that probably
developed after Uchumataqu and Chipaya speaking groups had lost contact are
predicator -kasi, question bound topic marker -xwi, and In-Group marker -acu. The
non-existence of predicator -kasi in Chipaya relates to another difference: in
Uchumataqu, predicator -kasi distinguishes adjectives as a separate word class, while
in Chipaya adjectives form a subcategory of nouns (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:103) but
do not constitute a class of its own5. Uchumataqu resultative -/ resembles Aymara
resultative marker -ta to some degree and Chipaya seems to have borrowed the
Aymara marker. Thus, Uchumataqu -/ and Chipaya -ta are not entirely different but
contrast, just like Uchumataqu -t and the Aymara morpheme. It is possible that
Uchumataqu -t derives from the Aymara form and would be therefore a morpheme
that developed after Uchumataqu and Chipaya had become separated.
One of the more crucial differences between Uchumataqu and Chipaya is the
locative marking system. As will be further outlined under 4.1.1.2 and 4.1.1.3,
Uchumataqu has two basic locative forms, which are -kis and -fa/, each of which has
an allomorph derived by metathesis: -kis I -ski and -fa/' / -sikf. The form -kis I -ski is
the directional locative, which marks a movement 'into X' with motion verbs, while
with stative or position verbs it is translated as 'in X'. The form -fa/' / -siki expresses
a locative and is always understood as 'in X'. I analyse this as a system in transition
(cf. 4.1.1). Chipaya also has two locative markers -kiz(i) and -kin(a), which do not
possess metathesised allomorphs. The form -kiz(i) refers to entities or objects being
close to the speaker, while -kin(a) marks entities or objects being away from the!
Chipaya preserves lexicalisations with -Un, a form that in Uchumataqu serves to create adjectival states,
which form a subcategory of adjectives In Uchumataqu, -/in was still productive at the time of
documentation, but lexicahsed forms with -Im exist too (for further discussion, cf 4 3 5) In Chipaya, it is
doubtful whether the form -tin is still productive Cerrón-Palomino (2006) does not interpret it as a
morpheme
It has to be noted that the interpretation of-ski and -siki as allomorphs is arguable It may possible that
both forms represent one morpheme and -ski is the same as -siki only with an unstressed -siCHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION7speaker (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:128). Uchumataqu, too, uses a form -kina but it is
purely directional. Thus, the two systems are rather different. When I asked a native
speaker of Chipaya to translate the Uchumataqu expression wat-siki 'in the village'
(Uhle 1894:19), he understood it as 'the weave (el tejido)', thus analysing wat- as the
verb stem 'to weave', -s possibly as the action nominaliser followed by a linking
vowel -/', and topic marker -kf.
Another case of formally similar but functionally different suffixes are Chipaya
-z and Uchumataqu -s. Chipaya -z is analysed by Cerrón-Palomino (2006:159, 160)
as 'reflexivo-mediopasivo', while for Uchumataqu -s I propose an interpretation as
first person singular subject marker. Even if possible interpretation errors are left
aside, the fact remains that both suffixes appear in the same slot, are preceded and
followed by the same types of morphemes, and they even have similar allomorphs,
namely -zh in Chipaya and -s in Uchumataqu. Nonetheless, they cannot express the
same idea since Chipaya -z is not restricted to a particular person, whereas
Uchumataqu -s marks a first person singular as subject. Thus, formally they are
almost identical but differ considerably with respect to function.
One of the greatest differences between Uchumataqu and Chipaya is that the
latter has a gender distinction, which Uchumataqu entirely lacks. The Chipaya gender
distinction affects nouns, pronouns, and the personal clitics, although there is a
growing tendency to neglect the use of female pronouns, particularly with respect to
the plural form nanaka 'they (fern.)'. This may be due to a growing Spanish
influence on Chipaya, since in Spanish a group of men and women is referred to as
ellos 'they (masc.)'. Only if there is a group composed solely of women would the
female form ellas 'they (fern.)' be used. A similar use of ninaka 'they (masc.)' and
nanaka 'they (fern.)' can be observed in Chipaya8.
It is possible that some of the morphemes described as characteristic only for
Chipaya existed in Uchumataqu before it became highly endangered. Alternatively, it
is possible that they existed even at the time of documentation, but went unnoticed
because documentation would have required a long-term study of a wider range of
data including conversations between native speakers, story telling, etc. However,
given the high number of different morphemes or formally similar but functionally
different affixes, it seems doubtful that intelligibility between speakers of
Uchumataqu and Chipaya has ever been very high, despite Wachtel's observation
(1990:269) that during a recent meeting of Uchumataqu and Chipaya speakers both
groups could talk to each in ""Uru-Chipaya"". During field-work carried out in January
2006, I asked several native speakers of Chipaya to translate phrases and simple
clauses from Uchumataqu and the outcome was very different. In some cases, there
was hardly any or no understanding at all, while in other cases there was a certain
degree of intelligibility. However, the fact that some Uchumataqu phrases from UhleThe interpretation and transcription of these morphemes in Chipaya provided by Cerrón-Palomino
(2006) is slightly different: what I termed action nominaliser -s is labelled the ""infinitivizador"" -z(a)
(Cerrón-Palomino 2006 131), while what I analyse as a linking vowel -ι is termed by Cerrón-Palomino
(2006.87) as ""inflexion vocalica"" The interpretation of-Ai as topic marker is the same for Uchumataqu (cf.
7 2 2) and Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino 2006 175).

Personal communication with a native speaker of present-day Chipaya8UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAand Métraux could be interpreted by Chipaya speakers does not prove immediate
intelligibility since a French native speaker would probably understand the basic
meaning of a written Spanish text, even without knowledge of Spanish but that would
be probably quite different if (s)he were confronted with rapid, spoken Spanish. This
was actually the case when during field-work I asked the Chipaya native speakers to
listen to the Uchumataqu passages in Vellard's film: none of them could immediately
understand what has been said and it was only after several sessions that they had
gained a general idea of the Uchumataqu texts. That is, it has probably been possible
for an Uchumataqu native speaker to understand whether a Chipaya speaker talked
about his / her family, fanning, or the latest transactions made in La Paz, but details
may remain obscure.
1.1.3 Aymara, Spanish, and Quechua influence
Aymara is the language that had most influence on Uchumataqu, while Spanish
contributes mainly lexical items to the language, and Quechua can be regarded as
exerting only a minor influence. In some cases it is difficult or even impossible to
determine whether a feature is a loan or an areal phenomenon shared by many
Andean languages, since we have to take into consideration that these three
languages were neighbours for centuries or even millenia. I will discuss this further
below (cf. 1.3).
In Uchumataqu, influence from other languages is found mainly in the
phonology and morphology and, of course, its lexicon. I will first present loan
phenomena in phonology before turning to a brief description of morphological and
lexical loans.
One of the most remarkable changes brought forward by an increasing Aymara
influence is the reduction of the formerly 5-vowel system of Uchumataqu to a 3vowel system of the Aymara (and Quechua) type, i.e. from /a/, /e/, /il, lol, and /u/
reduced to /a/, HI, and Iwl (cf. Muysken 2001:82).
In other aspects of phonology, Spanish exerted influence on Uchumataqu.
Among the few sounds that are maintained in Spanish loan words are [b], [g], and [f],
although in the majority of all cases, loan words are adapted to Uchumataqu
phonology. These changes affect mainly sounds from Spanish loan words, but are
also applied to Aymara or Quechua words if their structure violates a phonological
rule of Uchumataqu. Thus, Aymara lluchu 'cap', for example, is changed to lukcu
(Polo 1901:470) since Uchumataqu does not allow [11] in word initial position. For a
more detailed description, cf. 2.6.
When looking at the bound grammatical morphemes of Uchumataqu, one finds
only a relatively small number that are actually borrowed from Aymara or Quechua.
Among the more recent loans we find affirmative -pini, whose use is testified only in
the material of Vellard9 (1949-1967), intensifier -paca, and plural marking -naka
used on personal pronouns. Other possibly less recent loans are resultative -t,
terminative -kama and benefactive -taki.","[22, 23, 24, 25]"

Chronologie meiner Erfahrungen57:!) and for all we know, this was his only visit to
the community. He does not provide the name of his language consultant but only
refers to him as ""at least one who taught me his language, in spite of his fellows""58
(Uhle 1896:19, translation mine). That is, the Uchumataqu data collected by Uhle
stem from one single speaker and except for the fact that he was male nothing further
is said about him. Neither does Uhle specify the personal relationship to his language
consultant, although he twice mentions him as his ""teacher"" (Uhle 1894:3, 89.1).
However, we do not know whether he refers to his visit to Irohito or Huachacalla.
With respect to his language skills, Max Uhle spoke Spanish but probably
hardly any Aymara59 at the time he visited Irohito and it was only after his trip to
Irohito that Uhle became more acquainted with Aymara (cf. Rowe 1954:106).
Although he mentions an interpreter for his studies on Chipaya (Uhle 1896:331)60,
we find no unequivocal hint to an interpreter for his trip to Irohito. Only once does
Uhle (1894:82, translation mine) remark upon ""an interpreter speaking a second
Indian language""61 but it remains uncertain whether he refers to his study on Chipaya
or Uchumataqu. However, it seems justified to assume that Uhle was dependent upon
an interpreter in Irohito as well. Thus, the languages used in the process of data
collection must have been Uchumataqu, Aymara, and Spanish.
The Uchumataqu data have never been published and are thus available only as
a manuscript, which, as part of Uhle's academic legacy, is in the possession of the
Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin. The manuscript is handwritten in what is
today an old-fashioned script called Siitterlin and with a few exceptions Uhle uses
German throughout his notes.
The part of the manuscript that is of importance here is the grammar of
Uchumataqu and Chipaya called ""Basic outline of an Uro grammar"" (Grundzüge
einer Uro-Grammatik). It consists of 117 single and double pages, some of which are
not numbered, in which case I cite them as e.g. 64.1. Here, 64 refers to the last page
number Uhle used, while . 1 indicates that it is the first unnumbered page after this;
correspondingly, 64.2 would refer to the second unnumbered page following p. 64.
Although the first section in Uhle's manuscript is about the language of Irohito,
the manuscript itself is concerned with both varieties, i.e. Uhle treats Uchumataqu
and Chipaya and melts them into one grammatical description. He often indicates
where he obtained a particular piece of information from or which variety a statement
refers to, but does not consistently do so. In some cases, he points to differences
between the two varieties. However, Uhle deals with every aspect of the language
and his manuscript is thus an entire grammar of Uru-Chipaya. Although Uhle
collected a considerable number of sentences and more than 600 words in Irohito
(Uhle 1896:19), his grammar does not contain texts but single sentences. These are
transcribed according to the phonological transcription conventions of Uhle's time'Chronology of my expenences' (translation mine)
""[ .] wenigstens einen, der mich, den eigenen Angehöngen zum Trutze, seine Sprache lehrte.""

58CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION31(cf. chapter 2) and therefore the data convey not only grammatical but also
phonological information. As it was common in the late 19th century, Uhle used a
Latin-based model for his grammar, which particularly with respect to the verbal
system led to a certain frustration on the researcher's part:
While recording the language I tried several times to conjugate a short verbal
phrase through the different tenses but all I got was that with every person I
received an entirely new tense changing the entire meaning of the sentence,
[...]. Particularly the answers on tense were always the most unsatisfactory.
Some of these answers I had to correct by cross-checking two, three times but
did not always succeed. (Uhle 1894:84, translation mine)62
Uhle also compares his results to Aymara referring to the grammar of Middendorf
(1891), observing similarities and differences and repeatedly pointing to the
increasing Aymara influence on Uchumataqu.
From Uhle's difficulties to describe the verbal system a certain bias results
towards the nominal and pronominal system of the language: it is by far the most
elaborate section and an almost complete description of the nominal and pronominal
aspects of Uru-Chipaya. In comparison, the verbal system is less detailed and as
indicated in the quotation above, Uhle is concerned mainly with the tense system,
while he is less interested in e.g. aspectual features. Furthermore, most of the data
exemplifying the verbal system seem to come from Chipaya. Other parts of the
language are treated equally briefly, e.g. postpositions, clausal markers, and adverbs.
Each of these topics receives only a few pages' treatment. In the following I give a
rough sketch of the contents of the grammar. The numbering is mine.

"(Métraux 1935:106)When the negation is inflected with affirmative -pini, the meaning of ana extends to
'never', thereby reflecting the affirmative sense of -pini. Thus, -pini rules out the
basic meaning of ana. Affirmative -pini itself can be combined with declarative -cay.
(44)anaxuwa sels-cay ana-pini slekisini
totora be-DEC NEG-AFF duck egg
'There is no totora, [there are] never [again] duck eggs.'
(Vellard 1949:151)NEGIn one instance, ana is inflected with certainty -kala (cf. 5.9) which takes a position
normally reserved for affirmative -pini since certainty -kala is a verbal and
affirmative -pini a clausal clitic.
(45)kuya tax-cay sax-aki-cay ana-kala ci cuna
house roof-DEC drip-FU-DEC NEG-CERT one good
'It will drip from the roof of the house (lit: 'the roof of the house will
drip'); it is [certainly] not good.'
('ku-ya tax-cay sax-r-kicay hana Kala c/'-cwna') (Vellard 1949:166)Since affirmative -pini is a more recent loan from Aymara (Porterie-Gutiérrez
1981:331f), its occurence is limited to the works of Vellard (1949-67) and Muysken
(2005) (cf. 7.2.3). In all cases, the emphasised negative expression ana-pini- precedes
the item it refers to.
So far, morphological processes have been discussed. The following will deal
with lexical processes involving negative morpheme ana. It can be combined with
indefinite pronouns in order to build negative indefinite pronouns595 (see 4.2.4). It
occurs with hek 'who' (only attested for Uhle 1894), culu or ci-culu 'something'596,
cila 'another', and the lexical expression ti suni 'this man'. Depending on the
indefinite pronoun, the resulting expression means either 'no one, nobody', 'nothing',
or 'not one'. Although negative ana can be inflected with clausal and personal clitics
(examples 46, 47), its scope is over the indefinite pronoun, i.e. an expression as e.g.
ana-pini hek means 'certainly no one' and not 'never one' (example mine). Thus, the
combination of ana and an indefinite pronoun rules out the meaning a clausal clitic
has on the negation on its own (example 47). The indefinite pronouns themselves can
take nominal or clausal clitics but in most cases they are not marked at all.",[280]
"9With one exception found in Métraux (1935 108)CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION9The form -paca occurs in two different functions in Uchumataqu. In its first function
it is attached to adverbs of time in order to act as intensifier (cf. 6.1.1). Both Aymara
and Quechua have a noun paca meaning 'time' and it is likely that Uchumataqu paca in its intensifying function on temporal adverbs has been inspired by it. There is
another form -paca on Uchumataqu wakpaca 'all, everything', which consists of
Aymara waki 'part, portion' (also 'price') (DeLucca 1983:444) and the totality
marking suffix -pacha (DeLucca 1983:328). The expression wakpaca itself is not
used in Aymara and waki occurs only in the last stage of Uchumataqu, as
documented by Vellard.
The plural marker -naka occurs in both Aymara and Uchumataqu and it is
impossible to say whether its use on nouns is recent or not, whereas its use on the
personal pronoun ninaka 'they' is possibly a more recent development (cf. 4.1.4).
Terminative marker -kama occurs in Aymara, Quechua, and Uchumataqu. In
Aymara and Quechua it has a distributive and terminative meaning. In Quechua,
terminative -kama also outlines the direction of a course or trajectory. This meaning
is not found in Aymara but a meaning of terminative -kama limited to Aymara is that
of'only', i.e. exclusiveness. In Uchumataqu, these different meanings of terminative
-kama have been reduced to temporal 'until'. It is this restricted use that gives rise to
the assumption that -kama spread from Aymara or Quechua into Uchumataqu and not
vice versa, although it is not impossible, either, that Aymara or Quechua adopted this
suffix from Uchumataqu and extended its meaning (cf. 4.1.1.6).
A similar observation can be made for benefactive -taki, which has been
borrowed from Aymara. Uchumataqu adopted only the benefactive function, in
which benefactive -taki is translated as 'for'. In Uchumataqu, possessive predicate
clauses are created with the benefactive marker -taki and the copulative verb sel- 'to
be, exist'. These constructions are translated as 'for X exists', as in wir-takfij sel-cay
koya 'I have a house.' (lit.: 'For me a house exists.' Vellard 1951:33). This function
of benefactive -taki is not found in Aymara (cf. 4.1.2.2).
The Uchumataqu resultative marker -t resembles the Aymara resultative marker
-ta with respect to form and function to some degree. It is possible that both suffixes
influenced each other or one inspired the use of the other, but Uchumataqu resultative
-/ is not a direct loan from Aymara -ta (cf. 5.2.1).
The lexicon is by far that part of Uchumataqu that shows the largest degree of
borrowing. However, not every word shared with Aymara or Quechua is necessarily
a loan. We may assume that the name of fish, water birds, types of totora reed and
other water plants as well as denominations for balsa rafts, their parts, and tools for
hunting and fishing were adopted by Aymara and Quechua from Uchumataqu rather
than vice versa. However, when it comes to agricultural terms and words denoting
non-aquatic plants and species, expressions found in both Aymara and Uchumataqu
are probably loans in the latter. Spanish had some influence on Uchumataqu with
respect to kinship terms and, of course, modem technical devices. Note that one of
the last semantic fields not influenced are Uchumataqu numbers10, although VellardIn contrast to Chipaya, where numerals above 4 have long been replaced by the Aymara terms10UCHUMATAQU THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA(1951 18) reports pataka '100' instead of kalo-kalo, which would have been the
Uchumataqu word The word pataka is Aymara but also close to Quechua pachak
Finally, I should mention some features that can be described as areal
phenomena rather than loans Among these areal features are the agglutinative nature
of Uchumataqu, its predominately SOV structure, stress on the penultimate syllable,
and the structure of the Uchumataqu nominal and verbal system, which resemble that
of Aymara and Quechua Thus, although Uchumataqu is genetically unrelated to
Aymara and Quechua, centuries-long contact produced a certain degree of adaptation
and similarity
In the present study, I compare Uchumataqu to the northern Aymara variety
spoken around Lake Titicaca, which has been described by Porterie-Gutiérrez (1981)
and Huayhua Pari (2001), who carried out a study on the Peruvian variety of Aymara
Since Lake Titicaca stretches across the border of Peru and Bolivia, it is justified to
take also into consideration the Peruvian Aymara variety, which may as well have
exerted some influence on Uchumataqu Only if there is an Aymara element present
in my data but undescnbed by Porterie-Gutiérrez and Huayhua Pan do I refer to
works dealing with other Aymara varieties
1 2 The present study
In the following I will briefly describe the theoretical framework applied for the
current study, the terminology resulting from the theoretical framework, and the
methodology used m working with the Uchumataqu data
7 2 7 Theoretical framework and terminology
Given that the material on Uchumataqu is heterogenous and that the grammatical
description is meant for linguists from different backgrounds, no specific linguistic
theoretical framework is employed Instead, it is first and foremost a descriptive
work, whose theoretical framework can be best described by what Dixon (1997 128)
calls ""Basic Linguistic Theory"" Dryer (in prep 3) supplies the following explanation
of what can be understood by this ""It can thus be roughly described as traditional
grammar, minus its bad features (such as a tendency to describe all languages in
terms of concepts motivated for European languages), plus necessary concepts absent
from traditional grammar [ ] Basic linguistic theory differs from traditional
grammar most strikingly in its attempt to describe each language in its own terms,
rather than trying to force the language into a model based on European languages ""
That is, basic linguistic theory is primarily descriptive, adopting ideas, techniques,
etc from other theories, if they refer to or describe a phenomenon appropriately
Works that contributed to a considerable degree to the framework of the current
description of Uchumataqu are among others Shopen (1985) and Payne (1997)
Correspondingly, specific terminology has been avoided whenever possible
However, if a particular theoretical concept or term has been borrowed, its usage in
the current grammatical description is explainedCHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION111.2.2 Notes on methodology and presentation of the data
First, it is necessary to provide a definition of what is considered as primary and
secondary data in the current study. By primary data, I understand data that have
been collected during field-work and thus represent first-hand experience of
Uchumataqu and its speakers. Since the current work is primarily a linguistic
description, purely ethnographic data are considered mainly for background
information on the Uru culture and history (cf. Posnansky 1934, LaBarre 1941,
Palavecino 1949). I consider the following sources as primary data: Uhle (1894),
Polo (1901), Bacarreza (1910), Lehmann (1929), Métraux (1935), LaBarre (1941),
Palavecino (1949), Vellard (1949, 1950, 1951, 1967), Grinevald (1995), and
Muysken (2001, 2005). Secondary data are those that provide an analysis and
interpretation on the basis of primary data and therefore studies as e.g. Torero (2002)
are regarded as secondary data and add to the description only to a minor degree. The
grammatical description attempted is first and foremost concerned with primary
linguistic data on Uchumataqu.
The spelling of the data quoted here is based on what has been established as the
phonemic system of Uchumataqu (cf. 2.1-2.10). However, it is not a phonemic
spelling in a strict sense, since at the present state of research I am unable to state
what the phonemes of e.g. the word 'to go' are. I will thus present different possible
spellings. This leads, of course, to a certain amount of variation. For example, the
verb for 'to go' is represented as either oq-, ok-, or ok""a (another example can be
found in table 2.1). For further discussion of orthographical practices and
representation, cf. 2.14.
In most cases I adopt the translations provided by the researchers, who have
been with the Uchumataqu speakers and probably had the best opportunities to crosscheck their material. However, in case I propose an analysis, interpretation, and / or
translation different from that of the researcher, the original analysis, interpretation
and / or translation is provided in brackets. This also applies to Uchumataqu forms,
phrases, or clauses for which I propose a different transcription, as is the case with
e.g. -srap'pa (Vellard 1949-67). I propose to transcribe the form as -s-xapa but add
Vellard's original transcription in brackets. Elements I reconstruct, such as e.g. topic
marker -k[i], are marked by brackets, while parenthesis mark additions, restrictions,
etc. made by the researchers themselves. However, in any case, glosses are mine.
The primary data are always quoted with the year of publication, i.e. although
Vellard might have collected certain data in 1938, he published them in 1949 and
accordingly, I quote material from this work as Vellard (1949). Only in the case of
the unpublished material of Uhle and Lehmann do I refer to the year the material has
been collected. In Uhle's case, this would be 1894, while Lehmann is quoted as
1929b and 1929d. Since no other researcher (with the exception of Uhle, see below)
provides data from outside Irohito, this is necessary only with Lehmann.
As will be further outlined below, Uhle (1894) aims to merge data from
Uchumataqu and Chipaya in his manuscript and in some cases does not indicate
whether a certain example comes from Uchumataqu or Chipaya. Therefore, I decided
to use only those clauses, phrases, etc. that are clearly marked as from Uchumataqu.
However, in some cases I also quote unmarked material, i.e. material the origin of12UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAwhich is uncertain but I only do so when that material can be confirmed by other
sources on Uchumataqu (e.g. Vellard 1949-67). An example is the phrase am qoya
'your house' (Uhle 1894:46), which is not marked for origin. Since identical phrases
are found in other sources that exclusively contain data from Uchumataqu, such as
amp kui[a]u 'your house' (Vellard 1967:29), Uhle's unmarked example clause can
be included in the grammatical description. However, such cases are exceptional and
if an unmarked example from Uhle's manuscript is given, it is indicated in a footnote.
1.3 Historical overview: from colonial times until today
In the following, I will give a brief description of notes and reports on the Uru from
early colonial times to the most recent studies.
1.3.1 The names Uru and Uchumataqu
Several names have been applied to the Uru and their language during the last 500
years. In what follows, I will give a brief overview of the names applied and will
discuss the denomination chosen for the current work. The list of sources quoted in
the following is by no means exhaustive but represents only a part.
In colonial sources we find the name Uro to be the most common one when
referring to the people12. Both Alonso Ramos Gavilân (Historia del santuario de
Nuestra Senora de Copacabana, [1621] 1988:82) and Antonio de Castro y del
Castillo (Juicio de Limites entre el Peru y Bolivia, [1651] 1906:201) also give the
name Ochosuma, and Gavilân specifies that this was the common appellation of the
ethnic group. The origin and meaning of this name is entirely uncertain and we do
not even know whether it was a self-denomination of the Uru people or a name given
to them by their neighbours. With respect to the language, most chroniclers do not
provide a name but only say that the Uru had their own language, which was
different from all others. However, Mercado de Penalosa ([1586] 1965:336) and
Balthasar Ramirez ([1597] 1936:48) state that the Uru language was called Pukina.
According to Espinoza Soriano ([1575-77] 1981:195, translation mine), Uru and
Uruquilla were denominations of two different ethnic groups: ""The Uros in this
empire are less numerous than the Aymaras, Uruquillas and Sevaroyos.""13. This
opinion is not shared by Weston LaBarre (1941:500), who states: ""The Uroquillas of
the early chroniclers appears to have meant the Uru; [...]•""· Espinoza Soriano's
observation is likewise rejected by Torero. Following Torero (2002:468), Uruquilla
refered to the language family Uru-Chipaya, while the name Uro (or Ochosuma)
meant only the people with a water-based economy. In the process of aymaricisation,
the term Uruquilla was lost and the appellation Uru, formerly restricted to the people,
became generalised to refer to the speakers and their language. In the light of what
has been said by Espinoza Soriano, LaBarre's and Torero's statements may be
questioned, although the discussion about Uru and Uruquilla continues.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"

Declarative -cay is the only suffix that follows the future tense markers which shows
that -a I -aki belong to the last verbal elements attached to a verb. No derivations,
short or alternative forms of -a or -aki are encountered.
5.2 Aspectual suffixes
In contrast to tense, aspect refers to how an action or event occurs rather than to when
it does. As Payne (1997:238) puts it, it ""describes the internal temporal shape"" of
actions and / or events. For Uchumataqu only three aspectual affixes can be

small number is probably due the status of Uchumataqu as an already highly
endangered language when first described in 1894 and the general circumstances of
its description. However, two of the three affixes possibly are direction marking
morphemes (ke- 'return' and -lay 'aimless'), whereas the third one (resultative -/)
modifies tense.
5.2.7 Resultative-t
The verbal marker -/ belongs to the aspectual system of Uchumataqu where it fulfils
several functions. Its most typical one is to mark a resultative, i.e. the result or
outcome of an action or event. There, the marker appears either on its own (38) or is
followed by certainty -kala and / or declarative -cay (39).

"CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS139compounds is their syntactic behaviour, i.e. since compounds form a single part of
speech, they syntactically behave as any other member of this class and occupy an
appropriate position (e.g. clause initial in case the compound is a noun functioning as
a subject). As will be shown with greater detail in chapter 7, Uchumataqu has a
relatively free word order, and although it is in principle SOV, nearly every word
order is possible and thus, the position an item can take does not provide much
evidence. However, if an item occurs repeatedly as a unit in the sources and its
components are never split up by other constitutents (as is the case with kot ' sum),
then it is likely to be a compound. The last criteria to be mentioned are semantic: the
""degree of lexicalised meaning"" and the ""degree of compositionality"" (Anderson
1985:44). The meaning of a compound is often more than the sum of its parts and
lexicalised. Consider (28):
(28)p-cincu
bird
'wing'kara
hand
(Lehmann 1929b: 1)In establishing compounds on a semantic base, I interpret those items as compounds
that occur with some frequency in the sources291 and / or whose meaning is noncompositional. This is not without obstacles, either: an item still documented in e.g.
Uhle (1894) may be already lost in e.g. Métraux (1935) although it was lexicalised.
In some cases, the sources offer divergent translations for the same item, which can
make the status of the item in question doubtful. In other cases, the appearance of an
object is that of a compound but with respect to semantics, a lexicalised meaning is
less likely, as demonstrated in example (29).
(29)tuxsfaj kuya-cay
foreign house-DEC
'it is a house of others; an Aymara house292 (Vellard 1967:7)Example (29) shows an object which at first sight could be understood as a
compound since two words follow each other immediately and inflection (i.e.
declarative -cay) occurs on the second component. However, with respect to
frequency of use, it is less likely that an expression such as this would have become
lexicalised and furthermore, it is compositional and thus, instances such as example
(29) are not regarded as compounds293.1 would like to point out that for establishing
compounds I rely mainly on semantic criteria, which can be supported by
morphophonological, morphological, and syntactic findings.
Uchumataqu makes frequent use of compounding, particularly with kinship
terms and body parts. Uchumataqu compounds can be understood as consisting of a
head and its modifier, the head being nominal whereas the modifier can be another
noun, an adjective, or an adverb. The order is modifier-head. Consider (30) to (32):2,1Which points to their lexicalised status.
tuxsa means 'foreign' but is mainly used to denote the Aymara people.
Another semantic test for the compound status are paraphrases (Anderson 1985 42). However, this
cannot be tested since the sources do not offer periphrastic descriptions (in Uchumataqu) for compounds.

true, then the Uchumataqu speakers borrowed both components from Aymara,
'glued' them together by means of linking element -/, and derived a new meaning for
the resulting item.

lexicalised, and translations agree on that it means 'hunger; to be hungry'. The first
component is known as ceri 'stomach' but tuk does not occur as an independent
lexical item299. It is even doubtful whether ceri s-tuk- (regardless of the spelling) can
be considered a compound since the element -s (or *-) is reminiscent of third person
clitic - j , which always occurs word initially or finally. If this is true, then the
expression for 'hunger' consists of two lexical items.

"CHAPTER 5 - THE VERBAL SYSTEM231In principle, causative -sna can occur with every verb class but there are restrictions
with respect to its allomorph -ska (see below). The form -sna appears with
(transitive) cognition and utterance verbs (73) as well as with (intransitive) states
(74), thereby turning them into transitive verbs.

'Quickly, make [someone] spear it! '
impronto ensartale (unpez con un chuzo depescay)(Ve\\ard 1967:1)Even less evidence is available for the form -ska and therefore it is likewise uncertain
whether it marks a causative or whether it is a regular morpheme at all. However, if
the form -ska is an allomorph of causative -sna, there is a pattern of distribution
according to verb class (see above). Remarkably, the forms are apparently not
distributed according to transitivity, with e.g. one form attached only to intransitive
verbs and the other reserved for transitive ones. No hard and firm conclusions can be
drawn but it is possible that the notion of control may be of importance here (cf.
Payne 1997, referring to Haiman 1983)513. If this is true, causative -sna and its
allomorph -ska may indicate different degrees of control the causée exercises upon
the action. Then the form -sna marks a low degree of control on the causee's side
since one cannot choose what (s)he sees nor can e.g. a pot decide whether it is filled
or not. Similarly, the allomorph -ska, occuring with action and action-process verbs,
expresses that the causée exercises a higher degree of control since one can decide (at
least in theory) whether one wants to spear a fish or not. Therefore, one expects the
allomorph -ska to appear only with animate nouns.
As can be seen from the examples, causative -sna is attached directly to the verb
stem. In most cases, it is not followed by other morphemes although it can be
followed by imperative -a and clausal clitics as declarative -cay or topic marker
-λ/514.
From this, one would expect to find clear indication of person reference but in
fact most clauses do not contain person reference at all. If there is a pronoun, it refers

What the author says on the notion of control only serves as a basis for the following considerations I
do not apply Haiman's (1983a) theory here.
5,4
There are a few instances in which causative -sna is followed or preceded by elements such as -in, -ra,
or -CM (see example 76), none of which can be sufficiently explained Therefore, these instances are not
regarded as meaningful elements of Uchumataqu but rather as misinterpretations
512UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA232mainly to the causer, and only in two cases causer and causée are marked by
pronouns. It is to note that the data contain mainly singular items (as demonstrated in
examples 73 and 74) which do not constitute entire clauses and therefore it remains
uncertain how person reference would have been expressed. The following clause
(76) demonstrates the use of causer and causée where word order (causee-causer)
prevents a possessive interpretation.
(76)suwa wir lula-ska-cu-cay
childIeat-CAU-?-DEC'I feed the child (lit: 'I make the child eat.')·' (Muysken 2005:57)
It is only in Vellard's data (1949-67) that the form -am appears, which according to
Vellard (1967:33) marks a causative, as demonstrated below.

(Vellard 1949:162)However, the form -am occurs only with the verb saxk- 'to run' and example (77) is
the only complete clause that contains -am. Therefore, I do not regard the form -am
as marking a causative515 although a definite answer to what it expresses cannot be
given.
5.6 Nominalisation
Nominalisation describes the process by which a verbal root or stem changes its
grammatical category and becomes a noun, which then can be combined with
nominal morphemes. Uchumataqu has two nominalising morphemes, which are the
subject relativiser -ni whose main function is to mark an agent and the action
nominaliser s which serves to mark action nominalisation.
5.6.1 Subject relativiser -ni
Verbal subject relativiser -ni (SR) belongs to the nominalising suffixes. It fulfils
several functions of which its most typical one is to mark an agent. Although this is
not necessary, subject relativiser -ni often refers to an action that is specific or
characteristic of a person. This is attested e.g. for the word for 'sorcerer, magician'
sisni516 in (78). Here we find the conceptual link to the homonymous forms of
habitual present tense markers -in I -ni (cf. 5.1.2) which likewise mark an action or
event as habitually, i.e. characteristically, performed by somebody.

"Some temporal adverbs consist of lexical compounds, such as haqa winsi

The component winsi of haqa winsi 'tomorrow' never occurs on its own and
therefore, nothing can be said about its exact meaning or the semantic impact it has.
The same is true for yam of yam tuku 'not yet'. Sometimes there are alternative
forms, as e.g. hiya or his 'still' but the difference between these forms has also to
remain uncertain.
Temporal adverbs belong to those adverbs that behave nominally, i.e. they can
be inflected with nominal suffixes (see example 1). However, at least yasi 'now' can
take the adjectival predicator -kasi (cf. example 2 and chapter 4.3.2).

"36UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAAs part of Lehmann's academic legacy the manuscripts are in the possession of the
Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin. They have not been published77.
In the following description I will only discuss the fair copies of the
manuscripts78, i.e. the description excludes the original manuscript from Ch'imu. The
contents of the original manuscript and the fair copy from Ch'imu are mainly
identical but legibility of the fair copy is by far better. The only aspect in which the
fair copy differs from the original manuscript is that in the latter Lehmann provides
the names of his language consultants for each entry and gives a description of the
demographical situation. Furthermore, in the fair copy Lehmann combines the
numerals reported by his different language consultants: numerals 1 to 4 and 40 are
from one speaker, the numbers 5 to 10 and 20 from another. Apart from these
differences, both manuscripts are identical with respect to their linguistic content. I
will treat the manuscripts in their chronological order.
1.4.2.3.1 Manuscript from Ancoaqui (fair copy)
As Lehmann states in the fair copy, he visited Ancoaqui on October 12th 1929 and
made the fair copy the following day in La Paz, which means he spent only one day
in the community79. The fair copy consists of 26 pages80 with 453 entries, which are
mainly lexical. Until p. 21 Lehmann provides only nouns and adjectives, which cover
several semantic fields. It is noteworthy that the nouns refer mainly to concrete
objects, such as e.g. 'house', 'broom', 'knee', etc., although Lehmann also reports
kinship terms, such as 'brother-/sister-in-law' and some terms designating religious
phenomena, such as 'soul'. These purely lexical entries are followed on pages 21 and
22 by the numerals 1 to 10, 20 and 100, the personal pronouns, and a possessive
paradigm exemplified by the word 'house'. On pages 23 and 24 Lehmann presents
the drawing of a traditional Andean loom and ten Uchumataqu terms referring to its
parts. It is only on the last two pages (p. 25, 26) of his manuscript that Lehmann
gives some grammatical information. This consists of conjugations of the verbs 'to
be' and 'to give' and although the latter is supposed to be transitive, we find no
object expressed, i.e. Lehmann asked for 'I give', 'you give' and so on. He also
presents the forms 'I was', 'I am not', and 'I was not', which are single entries
without full paradigms. Page 25 also contains what appears to be a repetition of the
possessive paradigm presented on p. 22. On the last page Lehmann supplies the
intransitive form 'I die' and four examples of the transitive verb 'to kill': 'I kill you',
'you kill me', 'he kills me', and 'I kill him'.
The following unnumbered page shows Lehmann's hypothesis about a possible
genetic relationship between Uchumataqu and Atacameno81 and correspondingly, he
presents a comparative word list of 46 lexemes of these two languages on another
two pages (A and B). On the following two pages (a and ß) Lehmann comparesI am very grateful to the Ibero-Amenkamsches Institut for having allowed me access to the legacies of
both Max Uhle and Walter Lehmann
™ However, for Ancoaqui there is no other possibility since I had access only to the fair copy
79
As Dürr (1993174) points out this was Lehmann's common way to collect data.
80
Lehmann starts numbering on the first page of the word list. The introductory pages are not numbered
"" A consideration also mentioned by PoloCHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION37Uchumataqu with Mochica but points out that it has to be considered a ""preliminary
attempt""82 (Lehmann 1929b, a, translation mine). This list consists of 26 lexical items
as well as the numerals 5 and 6. Lehmann does not mention his sources for the
Atacameno and Mochica terms but the Uchumataqu terms must be from Ancoaqui
since Lehmann produced the list on October 13th 1929 in La Paz, i.e. two weeks
before he visited Ch'imu. However, he must have returned later to this material since
the lists are followed by a final remark, in which Lehmann explains that further
research on the Puquina texts of Ore is required to clarify the linguistic situation at
the northern coast of Peru. The note is dated April 24th 1931.
Lehmann uses Spanish in his manuscript with the exception of the introduction
and the description of the loom and its parts. However, Lehmann did not speak
Quechua or Aymara, as becomes apparent in the introduction to the Ch'imu
manuscript (Lehmann 1929d:ii)83. Since the Uchumataqu speakers did not understand
Spanish, Lehmann needed an interpreter to communicate with them (Lehmann
1929b:i)8'1. He describes the interview situation as follows: ""Using my synoptical
word lists the conversation with the Uru was pursued by the interpreter in Spanish,
Aymara, and Quechua.""85 (Lehmann 1929b:i). The interpreter (Lehmann 1929d:ii)86
is described as speaking not only Spanish but also Aymara and Quechua fluently.
However, some confusion arises with respect to the names and numbers of
interpreters actually involved. As Lehmann mentions on the first page to the
Ancoaqui manuscript (and repeats in the more detailed introduction to the Ch'imu
manuscript) he was accompanied by only one interpreter, but on the second page he
gives the names of two men he refers to as interpreters: Chunak kasi and Mariano
Kispe87. However, on p. 23 / 43488 Lehmann declares Suma Ch'ufiak kasi to be the
alleged name of his main language consultant. Lehmann does not further clarify the
situation of interpreters and language consultants involved, but I suppose that there
has been a misunderstanding since cuna-kasi is an Uchumataqu expression meaning
'it is well' or in the case of suma cuna-kasi 'it is very well'89. It is thus probable that
Lehmann interpreted as a name what in fact was only an agreement uttered by one of
his consultants. Lehmann himself seems to have mistrusted the statement of his
language consultant as he refers to it as the alleged name. Apart from these not
entirely clear notes Lehmann does not provide further specifications on his language
consultants or interpreter and their personal backgrounds. However, since Lehmann
refers to Chunak kasi as his ""main informant"" we may assume that other persons
were involved too. We do not know what kind of relationship there was between

visit to Ancoaqui
87
Posnansky (1934 264) lists the names of Manano Kispe (sen ) and Manano Kispe (jun ) and it is thus
possible that Minano Kispe indeed was not the interpreter but rather one of Lehmann's language
consultants

Ancoaqui it further seems doubtful whether there was any particular relationship at
all. However, according to Lehmann the Uchumataqu speakers were sympathetic
about the interview situation and encouraged him to learn their language. This
remained his only visit.
Taking this into consideration as well as the fact that most of Lehmann's data
are lexical, we find them less suitable for a grammatical description. However, when
compared to other sources, the vast majority of Lehmann's lexemes can be verified,
which is also true for his basic grammatical observations. As Uhle and Polo,
Lehmann visited Ancoaqui at a time when fully competent native speakers of
Uchumataqu were apparently still alive. This is reflected in his data, which contain
elements that cannot be found in later documents, e.g. the pronominal plural marker wici. Thus, the data provided by Lehmann can be judged reliable but less appropriate
for a grammatical description since they are mainly lexical.
1.4.2.3.2 Manuscript from Ch'imu (fair copy)
In contrast to the preceding manuscript, Lehmann supplies more detailed background
information in the manuscript from Ch'imu and also refers to his visit to Ancoaqui.
He visited Ch'imu on 26lh October 1929 where he met Florentino Valcufia, an elderly
fisherman who lived in the village. According to Lehmann's description, he started
working with Florentino Valcufia on the spot and collected a few hundred words.
When Florentino's son Nicolas Valcufia, alcalde90 of Ch'imu, appeared Lehmann
persuaded Nicolas to accompany him to Puno. They kept working at Lehmann's
hotel in Puno but Nicolas Valcufia returned to Ch'imu the same night. Although
Lehmann mentions her in the manuscript, the marniti Juanita Cuno did not
contribute to the data collection. Again, Lehmann spent only one afternoon in the Uni
community and did not return for further interviews. However, it is noteworthy that
Lehmann was the only researcher ever to have visited Ch'imu for the purpose of
collecting linguistic data. As such, his manuscript from Ch'imu can be regarded as
unique.
Lehmann's interpreter was Enrique Rodriguez Averanta, as is stated in the
original manuscript92; in the fair copy Lehmann (1929d:iii)93 only mentions that the
interpreter is a ""known poet"". He spoke Aymara with the Valcufia family and the
languages thus used in data recording were Spanish, Aymara, and Uchumataqu.
Lehmann made the fair copy in his hotel in La Paz (date unspecified) and on
board the ship back to Europe. The date given here is January 30th 1930, i.e. about
three months after his trip to Ch'imu. Like in the Ancoaqui manuscript Lehmann uses
Spanish, again with the exception of the introduction and some terms of which he
possibly did not know the Spanish name.
The manuscript from Ch'imu is slightly shorter than the one from Ancoaqui and
consists of 29 pages with 324 entries. Until p. 14 / 188 the word list is ordered

Numbering mineCHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION39alphabetically and contains mainly the same items as the Ancoaqui list, i.e. mainly
concrete nouns referring to body parts, clothing and such. On the following five
pages, Lehmann provides directions, temporal adverbs and expressions as well as
conjugations of the verbs 'to be' and 'to eat' and a possessive paradigm for the word
'house'. Numerals 1 to 10, 20, and 40 are provided on p. 19 to be followed by further
lexical entries, which do not belong to a particular semantic field but comprise only
nouns. Page 24 / 273 contains another example of a possessive paradigm of 'house',
which, however, is note complete since second and third person plural are missing.
Lehmann supplies purely lexical information on the following pages, but on pp. 27
and 28 adds conjugations of the verbs 'to be' and 'to give', again providing single
entries on 'I am not', 'I was', and 'I was not'. The verb 'to give' is used as an
example of a transitive verb. Lehmann repeats the drawing of the traditional loom
from Ancoaqui but this time lists thirteen items designating its parts. The headline
clearly states that the drawing was made two weeks earlier in Ancoaqui, so it is likely
that Lehmann used the older drawing in the absence of a real loom to collect some
more terms with Nicolas Valcuna. Most of these are German, probably because
Lehmann did not have the appropriate Spanish word at hand.
According to a final note, Lehmann wrote the introduction on March δ""1 1937 in
Berlin, i.e. almost eight years after his trip to Ancoaqui and Ch'imu.
As mentioned above, Lehmann notes which data were contributed by Florentino
or Nicolas Valcuna. It is noteworthy that the items provided by Florentino Valcufla
show a higher degree of Aymara influence than do those of his son Nicolas. This is
particularly the case with numerals and possessive paradigms. Florentino counts in
Uchumataqu until 4 but changes to Aymara then, while Nicolas gives all the
numerals in Uchumataqu. A similar observation concerns the possessive paradigms:
the one provided by Florentino is incomplete (see above) and it shows considerable
influence from Aymara due to the suffixed endings -ma and -pa. The paradigm given
by Nicolas is complete and is close to what other sources report as possession
marking, although Nicolas gives anxat as the pronoun of third person singular, which
cannot be confirmed by other sources. We find the following distribution of the data:
in more concrete fields, such as e.g. the making of balsa rafts, food, and animals,
most of the data were provided by Florentino Valcuna, whereas more abstract terms,
such as temporal adverbs, directions and all grammatical items were contributed by
his son Nicolas. As to the reason, we can only speculate. It is possible that Lehmann
found Nicolas a more suitable language consultant on Uchumataqu than his father.
With respect to how the data were collected, the manuscript from Ch'imu is
restricted by the same considerations as is the one from Ancoaqui, although Lehmann
supplies information about his language consultants. An evaluation of the linguistic
data is hardly possible due to the following reasons. First, the items provided by
Florentino Valcuna are to a certain degree influenced by Aymara, and his command
of Uchumataqu seems to have been weaker than that of his son. Second, since
Lehmann is the only person ever to have collected data in Ch'imu, a comparison with
the remaining sources, all on Ancoaqui, would not yield reliable results. Differences
can be ascribed to a higher degree of language attrition in Ch'imu and / or to dialectal
variation. Since there is no further material on Ch'imu, the question for dialectal40UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAvariation has to remain unanswered. What can be said is that even in those cases
where a Ch'imu word is close to its Ancoaqui equivalent, we almost always find
slight differences. In other cases, in particular in the verbal paradigms, the data
cannot be verified at all, i.e. they are neither Uchumataqu nor e.g. Aymara. This is
the case with e.g. anxata inarata (Lehmann 1929d:17), which is translated as 'he
eats' but inarata is neither Uchumataqu nor Aymara nor Quechua (for anxata see
above). Thus, data from the Ch'imu manuscript will be used only when they can be
verified by other sources on Ancoaqui.
1.4.2.3.3 Comparative word list (fair copy)
Finally, I will present the comparative word list. It does not contain new data, since it
is based on the word lists from Ancoaqui and Ch'imu. Furthermore, it contributes
only in a few cases to the grammatical description of the current work. I will thus
provide only a brief description.
The manuscript is preceded by a short introduction, where Lehmann repeats the
background information given in the Ancoaqui and Ch'imu manuscripts. A final note
says the fair copy was made in Chile in November 1929, but it is uncertain whether it
refers to the fair copy of the Ch'imu manuscript or the comparative word list.
The word list comprises three parts, of which the most comprehensive one is the
comparison itself. It consists of 32 pages with three columns each: the first contains
the Spanish entry, while the second one shows the corresponding Uchumataqu term
from Ch'imu and the last column the Uchumataqu expression from Ancoaqui.
Lehmann compares nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and numerals as well as grammatical
observations. On p. 8 he provides a comparison of numerals 1 to 10 of historical
Puquina (quoting Ore 1607) with his own data from Ancoaqui and Ch'imu94, and
Mochica, providing the name of Efa Isidora Isique, which remains unexplained. The
last two pages (unnumbered) of the manuscript show a comparison of numerals from
Chipaya95 with those from Atacameno. The comparison comprises the numerals 1 to
10 and 20 but the Chipaya numerals are complete only until 4. There are three notes
that refer to this comparative list of numerals: the first states that the comparison of
numerals was made on April 25,h 1931, the second dates from 1936. There, Lehmann
points out that he did not find Posnansky's material to be reliable but that he had
come across new words in Métraux's publication in the Journal de la Société des
Americanistes (Métraux 1936). Finally, Lehmann proposes that what he calls UruChipaya-Puquina must be related to Atacameno and Mochica but points to the less
satisfying situation of sources on Atacameno and Mochica, which have prevented a
more detailed investigation. This note is dated March 8th 1937.
The last page contains another comparison of numerals 1 to 10 and 20,
comparing Puquina, Uru-Chipaya, two proto-languages96, Mochica, and Atacameno.
Lehmann found all these languages related and suggested that they must originate in9' Apparently using the numerals provided by Nicolas, although the heading says otherwise.
Lehmann quotes Posnansky La lengua ""chipaya"" 1915.

Lehmann does not fürther specify whether these proto-languages refer to Proto-Uru-Chipaya or any
other proto-language.

1.4.2.4 Alfred Métraux (1902-1963)
The Swiss scholar Alfred Métraux was bom in Lausanne on November 5' 1902 and
in 1922 began his studies at the École des Chartes, the Sorbonne, and the École
Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris97 (Sachot 2007:61). In 1928 Métraux went to
Argentina, where he founded the Ethnological Institute at the University of Tucumân,
of which he was director for the following six years (d'Ans 1978:19f; Monnier
2003:9-14; Wagley 1964:603f; quoted in: Sachot 2007:61). He went on field-work
trips to the Chaco region. Northwest Argentina, and the Bolivian Altipiano. The data
on Uchumataqu (as well as on Chipaya) were collected during these years98. Alfred
Métraux committed suicide in Paris on April 11th 1963 (Sachot 2007:63).
As other researchers of the late 19th and first half of the 20lh century, Métraux is
not very detailed about the background information of his field-work. That is, there is
no comment on whether Métraux employed an interpreter or which languages were
used in the process of data collection. However, as Sachot (2007:64) points out
Métraux was accompanied by an Aymara speaking interpreter when visiting the
community of Chipaya and we may therefore assume that he also had an interpreter
with him when studying Uchumataqu. It is also likely that the languages used during
the interviews were Spanish, Aymara, and Uchumataqu. It remains likewise unkown
with whom Métraux collected his data and the only note made about one of his
language consultants refers to ""[u]n vieil Indien"" (Métraux 1935:88). We know that
he must have worked with more than one person since Métraux mentions his
""informateurs uro"" (Métraux 1935:89). It can be inferred from his data that Métraux
worked with elderly people who were fully competent native speakers of
Uchumataqu. Although Métraux does not further specify the kind of relationship
between him and his language consultants, he mentions an unhappy incident that took
place during his stay. The two Bolivian soldiers, who accompanied Métraux to
Ancoaqui, became annoyed with some inhabitants of the village and threatened to
bum their houses (Métraux 1935:89). It is likely that this incident did not improve
matters for Métraux.
Together with Posnansky, Métraux stayed in Ancoaqui for one week in June
1931 (Métraux 1935:75). It remained Métraux's only visit to the community. The
resulting article Contribution à l'ethnographie et à la linguistique des indiens Uro
d'Ancoaqui (Bolivie) was published in 1935, i.e. four years later. The language used
in the article is French.
The article consists of an introduction with some notes on the literature
published so far on the Uchumataqu speakers and a brief report of the circumstances
97Among his professors were well-known anthropologists of his time, as e g. Marcel Mauss and Paul
Rivet Métraux departed from university with a PhD degree, the topic of his work was the material culture
of the Tupi-Guarani.
98
In the following years, Métraux became interested in areas outside South America and between 1948
and 1950, he carried out ethnographical research in Haiti (d'Ans 1978 21; quoted in: Sachot 2007:621) As
a result, Métraux published Le vaudou haïtien in 1958, which is one of his best known works, and for
which he became famous.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"

the next morpheme begins with a consonant, i.e. it is rather -tak than -taki before

represented in the sources we lack firm basis for a statement about their conditioning.",[193]
