ka or a xajo
Drabbe 1957: section 17, page 9; section 45, page 17-18Parallel to what we saw for negative polarity in the previous section, polar
questions are also formed by the use of elements that have a predicative
function. The following table compares the strategies of forming polar
questions in nominal, adjectival and verbal clauses.",[141]
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes201Drabbe also gives a number of examples where the interrogative pronounmeoxo is used to refer to the possessor in a possessive construction. First
consider (267) and (268), where the latter gives two possible answers to the
former.
(267)gumeoxon-axude1562SGwhoLNK-humanCOP‘what clan do you belong to or where are you from?’
(lit. ‘whose person are you?’; Drabbe 1957:27a)
(268)Eban-axude /name.of.riverLNK-humanCOPXoxonasàfo
Xoxonasàfon-axudeLNK-humanCOP‘I am from the area of the Eba-river’ /‘I am someone from the Xoxonasàfo clan (Drabbe 1957:27a)Two other question-answer pairs are the following:
(269)gumeoxoxude /gumeoxosiüde2SGwhomanCOP2SGwhowomanCOP‘whose man are you?’ / ‘whose woman are you?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)
(270)Māxude/ MagubosiüdeMamanCOPMagubowomanCOP‘I am a man from the Mã clan’/ ‘I am a woman from (the place) Magubo’(Drabbe 1957:27a)Examples (271) through (273) form two final examples of interrogatives
referring to possessors. Note that (273) is an example of a possessive
construction embedded in another expression.","[218, 219]"
"4.1.2 Negative clauses and question clauses
For negative verbal clauses and verbal question clauses the reader is
referred to 2.6 and 2.7, respectively. In 4.6 below, we will compare thePART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure283structure of these clauses to some of the nonverbal clauses discussed in 4.2

o-xodeda-despeak-N1.RLS[SG]COPcome-1.RLS[SG]‘I came because he asked me’ (Drabbe 1957:39b)Drabbe contrasts the sentence above to (509) below, where one uses the
different-subject marker -ne. Compared to (509), sentence (508) stresses the
reason or the ground for coming: it is because he asked me that I came.
(509)o-xo-neda-despeak-N1.RLS[SG]-DScome-1.RLS[SG]‘he asked me and I came’ (Drabbe 1957:39b)I follow Drabbe in analyzing de as a copula.213 As the number of examples
given by Drabbe is limited, and as we have only few examples of this
construction in the text corpus, it is hard to characterize the precise function
of this construction. It can at least be said that speakers may embed verbal
clauses of different moods, including content questions. In (510)-(512) and
(515) we find realis verbal clauses (serving as an assertion), while (513) is
an example of an embedded irrealis. In (514) we have to do with a (realis)
content question (more on which will be said below). Example (516) and
(517), finally, are examples of embedded imperative clauses. In order to
clarify the structure of the clauses, I have given both a translation that
follows the Aghu structure quite closely, and a more liberal rendering.
(510)üfü-dudeefewusoxoxaimenaŋgi-kehit-1.RLS[SG]COP3SGbodypainbecome-1.RLS[SG]‘it is (because): I hit him and his body became painful’ ⇒ ‘his body is
painful because I hit him’ Drabbe 1957:39b)213Drabbe states literally that these sentences should be analyzed as verbal clauses thateare “predicated again” by the use of de (Drabbe 1957:40)PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure

1957:40a)298PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureIn the text corpus, verbal clauses embedded in a clause ending in de are
few. A clear example is found in the myth on the two brothers, where the
younger brother commands his brother twice to let loose of his scrotum.
(518)nēxo,midikenaden-ēxomi-di=kenade1SG-elder.brothercome.down-SS=CONstand.IMP[SG]COP‘my elder brother, you [let loose and] come down and stand’ (3.140, repeated
in 3.158)In order to better grasp the function of embedding verbal clauses in copula
clauses ending in de, it is important to note that the copula here stands in a
paradigmatic relation with negative de xo ‘NEG COP’; with interrogative ka /(a)xajo ‘QST’, and with counterfactual fini oxo ‘CFT COP’, more on which
can be found in 5.5.2. Especially informative is the contrast between open
questions and polar questions. Open questions begin with a question word,
and are optionally embedded in a copula clause ending in de, as illustrated
in (514) above, and (519) below. Closed or polar questions, however, are
embedded in clauses ending in ka or (a)xajo, as can be seen in (520)
(519)makumaxì-n-edehow/where/whengo_II-N1SG-FUTCOP‘(it is:) where will you go?’ (Drabbe 1957:40a)
(520)dà-xe=ka
come-N1.RLS[SG]=QST
‘(is it:) ‘he is coming’ ⇒ ‘is he going to come?’ (Drabbe 1957:17a)Compared to polar questions, in which the entire state of affairs is
questioned, here we have a given state of affairs, in which it is one
information gap that is emphasized. 214 Two further examples of verbal
214It should be noted that there is a fundamental difference between these two types ofpredicates. The use of de implies that the event has taken place, is taking place, or isPART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure299clauses embedded in de-copula clauses are the following. Note the use of
the focus marker ke in (522), which might be here taken as implying a
contrast.

As was stated in 3.1.7 and 3.6, there are good reasons to analyze te and ke
as case markers. Here I will defend this analysis, but show that they also
have a pragmatic function, which I tentatively describe as ‘focused’. I will
also explain why I analyze ke in certain contexts as a focus marker rather
than a case marker.
expected to take place. The use of ka or axajo puts in question whether the event has taken
place, is taking place or will take place. One might say that the use of de implies a high
degree of authority from the side of the speaker for the truth of the proposition, while polar
questions hand the authority for the truth of the proposition over to the addressee. Cf.
Timberlake (2007: 315f.).
215This is the only case where I have analyzed eke as an accusative; in all other cases ithas been analyzed as a 3SG pronoun plus focus, and glossed as 3SG.FOC; cf. 3.2.3.1.","[313, 314, 315, 316, 317]"
"4.2.5 Questions
Drabbe 1957: section 17, p. 9Interrogative nominal clauses are formed by means of the question particleka, as in (492), or by means of sentence final da xajo, where da is analyzed
as a copula, and xajo as a question particle, as in (493) and (494).209 The
optional use of the case markers te ‘NOM’ and the focus marker ke ‘FOC’ is
analogous to what was described for the affirmative counterparts.

not just mark a polar question, but are at the same time predicators over the
noun or over adjective. If we take this into account, the structure of the
polar questions formed with verbs is strikingly similar to the structure of
negative verbal clauses described in the previous section. Here too, the
verbal clause is embedded in another clause; the structure and semantics of
this construction could be rendered as in the following figure.","[141, 142]"
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure305First consider question clauses, formed either by a combination of copula a
and question maker xajo or by a single question copula ka. Note that —
analogous to what we saw for the use of moxo de in 4.4 above — the
verbal clause fills the same structural slot as a nominal or adjectival phrase.

reference to the wordlist means that the item was not attested in this list,
but only in one or more of the other sources. See, for example, abi or
abibiamV. Coming back to the references in non-bold, the following
method was followed. If an item was attested in the text corpus, I have
always added at least one reference to a place of occurence. In addition, I
have added references to sections in Drabbe or in this publication, only in
those cases where the form was not attested in the text corpus, or in cases
where these extra references were considered useful for the reader.
Verbs are given in their stem_I form; the form of the realis marker is given
in brackets, directly following the stem; cf. section 2.3.1.1. For the
corresponding forms of stem_II and the imperative stems, the reader is
referred to sections 2.2 and 2.5 respectively. For stems in -mV (where V is
a harmonizing vowel, cf. section 1.3) and those ending in nasal vowel, the
forms of the realis marker are predictable (-ox and -g, respectively, see
section 2.3.1.1), and, therefore, not indicated. Iterative stems have also not
been included; these can be found in section 2.4.1.
The words are presented in alphabetical order, where the mutual order of
unmodified vowels, nasal vowels and long vowels is random. For example,the order of ã, a and ā is random (all count as a). The same is true for the
mutual order of u and ü: both count as u. The consonant x ([x]) counts as
the English consonant x: it follows the consonant w and precedes z (y is not
attested in Aghu). Compounds directly follow the (first) word with which
they form a compound, so that e.g. a-müto is presented higher in the
alphabetical list than a word like abi.
Although Drabbe discusses the different parts of speech, and is aware that
there is not a one to one correspondence between parts of speech in Dutch
and in Aghu, he has refrained from giving the part of speech for each stem.
This means that the indication of the part of speech in this publication is389390PART II: WORDLISTS. Aghu-English wordlistsometimes not more than an ‘informed guess.’ An exception is formed by
words belonging to the class of verbs, as they can be formally
dinstuinguished from other forms by having a realis marker. Also formally
distinguishable are those adverbs that end in -mu. Apart from these verbs
and adverbs, the indicaton of membership is based on the meaning of the
form, based on the class membership indicated by Drabbe, or based on the
use of the form in the text corpus. In those cases where neither of these
criteria is sufficient, I have placed a question mark, as in the examples
presented below. The question mark proceeding n at ake indicates that it
might be a noun. As is clear from the remark, however, it is not attested as
an independent noun, so that it is only the analogy to other compounds
(where the second position is filled by a noun, cf. section 3.1) that would
justify the analysis of ake as a noun. The question mark after akimu
indicates that the part of speech is unclear. As indicated in the explanatory
remark, the word is attested only in combination with a following verb ogü,
and not attested independently. (It could be an adverb in -mu (cf. section
3.4.2), but lack of comparable forms, e.g. forms from which the adverb
could have been derived, makes this rather hypothetical.)Figure 20: part of the Aghu-English wordlist, with indication of the use of question marksThe translations in this word list are not always exactly the same as those
that we find as glosses in the text corpus. This is because the glossing in the
text corpus suffers from technical limitations, like the impossibility to use
multi-word descriptions in interlinear glossing, or the wish to keep the
glosses as compact as possible.","[406, 407, 408]"
"162The hypothesis that we have to do with grammaticalized forms which are no longer in aproductive relation to the shorter form is reinforced by the fact that the longer forms are no
longer fully predictable from the shorter forms, e.g. botu corresponds to boteaxa not
*botuaxa, and bodü corresponds to bodixa not *bodüaxa. We find the same axV and oxo in
the question words meoxo ‘who’ and makeaxe ‘what’, discussed in 3.2.5.1.",[229]

"-178Their use is generally optional, at least in certain contexts.179In his discussion of “schakelelementen” Drabbe also mentions maga, used only incombination with to ‘opening’ (Drabbe 1957:43a). To maga, then, is translated by Drabbeas ‘in the opening’ or ‘at the door’. This maga is probably better analyzed as spatial noun
(3.5.2), rather than as a postpositional case marker.
179Here we are limited because of a lack of data, and suffer especially from the lack ofdata obtained from independent fieldwork. One of the most straightforward ways to find
out whether a morpheme is optional, is to present an informant with both options, and ask
for the acceptability and meaning of both cases. Given that we lack this type of data, we
may conclude that the use of a morpheme is optional only in those cases where Drabbe´s
corpus happens to provide contrasting examples. And even then we do not know whether
there might be a subtle meaning difference going along with the use or non-use of the
morpheme in question.",[259]
"-A further characteristic of clause chaining can be the marking of
clauses for temporality: the question whether two events overlap or
take place in chronological succession. In Aghu this marking for
temporality is found in the type of clause chains that are discussed
in 5.4.2. This type of clause chains is rather rare, however.",[329]
"1.2.2 Syllable structure
Aghu syllable structure could possibly be rendered as in the following
figure:24Drabbe gives quite a few instances of /jV/ and /wV/-initial words, but only the following/iV/ and /üa/-initial words: io, ‘stone’, üaboxofi ‘lay down’. In these few instances, we cancontrast /j/ vs. /i/ and /u/ vs. /w/ in analogous environments: io ‘stone’ vs. jõ ‘copulate’ andüaboxofi ‘lay down’ vs. wa ‘bad’.
25I have analyzed long vowels as VV. It is also possible, however, to analyze them as V. Itfalls outside the scope of this book to go deeper into this question.",[38]
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs91Comparison of these two examples confirms that the main function of the
durative is to express the internal temporal structure of the event, as an
activity with a certain duration; the question of overlap with neighboring
events is not part of its meaning, but a matter of inference from the context.
It is also possible, however, that the different durative constructions (the
morphological duratives given in Table 15, durative with particle bu and
analytic duratives) differ at this point, in that some imply overlap and some
do not. Unfortunately, the data are insufficient at this point.","[108, 109]"
"Figure 19: parts of the Aghu-English wordlistAs can be seen in the figure above, references to the text corpus, sections in
this publication or sections in Drabbe are printed in the position following
the English translation (e.g. 1.135 etc. at a(x)). Numbers in non-bold font
refer to sections in the text corpus or in the grammatical introduction,
dependent on the structure of the code. References to the English-Aghu
wordlist, on the other hand, are given in bold font. The absence of numbers
in non-bold font means that the morpheme in question was attested in the
wordlist only. This is the case, for example, for adena above, which only
has a reference to the wordlist, in bold font: 029. Likewise, absence of a
introduction uses small caps to grammatical functions, the wordlist and texts use ‘normal’
capitals.",[406]

Drabbe 1957: sections 78-88, p.31-36Following Drabbe, who devotes 11 sections to the verbs ba(x) ‘sit’, e(k)‘stand’, and i(g) ‘lie’, this book also devotes a separate section to thediscussion of posture verbs. Following a brief introduction about irregular
inflections, section 2.8.1 offers a discussion of the meaning and use of
posture verbs as lexical verbs. Section 2.8.2 shows instances where posture
verbs are developing into a copula, but where the meaning aspect of posture
is still part of their lexical entry. Section 2.8.3, finally, considers several
other types of verbs derived from posture verbs and their uses.
While e(k) ‘stand’ and i(g) ‘lie’, and their stem_II counterparts ie and ai,
have fully regular paradigms, ba(x) ‘sit’ sometimes has o or u instead of aas final vowel of the stem. This is true for the following places in the
paradigm:PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs129Table 32: Irregular forms of ba(x) ‘sit’ (from Drabbe 1957:31-32)Semifinite realis

"4 Clause structureThis chapter discusses the structure of clauses. The focus of the chapter is
on main independent clauses: those clauses that can stand on their own, and
need not be followed by another clause in order to be grammatical; in Aghu
this category is formed by clauses headed by semifinite and finite verbs
(and nonverbal clauses). Some attention will also be given, however, to
clauses headed by nonfinite verbs. These clauses cannot stand on their own
and need to be followed by another clause in order to form a grammatical
sentence.
A clause can be defined as “the linguistic expression of a proposition”
(Payne 1997:71). In the present study, a verbal clause may contain
maximally one inflected verb: a nonfinite, semifinite or fully finite verb.
Sequences of verbs within one sentence are referred to as ‘clause chains’ or
even sequences of clause chains, more on which can be found in Chapter 5.
The first section of this chapter discusses verbal clauses (with the exception
of those headed by the copula verb ki(k) ‘become’), while the second
section deals with nonverbal clauses: nominal, adjectival and numeral
clauses. The second section closes with a section on clauses headed by the
copula verb ki(k). The remainder of the chapter will deal with a number of
other phenomena that operate at clause level. Section 4.6, finally, will
summarize the similarities and differences between the types of clauses that
were discussed: verbal and non-verbal positive, negative and question
clauses.","[288, 289]"
"5.5.1 Simple conditional sentences
Drabbe 1957:23aSimple, positive conditional sentences consist of an imperative or semifinite
irrealis clause that forms the protasis, and a future clause that forms the
apodosis. (575) through (577) are examples with a semifinite protasis, while
(578) exemplifies the use of an imperative. Note that (578) differs only
minimally from (577).

Drabbe 1957:23a)Negative conditional sentences are formed by the use of a negated verbal
noun which is predicated by the use of ki(k) ‘become’. This was illustrated
in (52) and (53) above (section 2.3.2.2.9 on verbal nouns in negative
sentences), and is repeated here as (579) and (580), respectively:

Drabbe (1957): section 58, p. 23Counterfactual conditional sentences are marked by a marker fini + copulaoxo in the final position of the protasis. Although Drabbe refers to fini as
an irrealis marker, I will gloss it as CFT ‘counterfactual’, to avoid the
suggestion that fini would combine with irrealis verbs; in fact, in all casesfini combines with realis verbs. There is a certain ‘logic’ to the use of a
realis, in that fini combines with verbs that refer to events that could in
principle have been actualized — this is expressed by the use of realis inthe verbal clause — but in fact have not — this is expressed by the use ofthe counterfactual marker plus copula oxo. The structure of the protasis is
analogous to the structure of negative clauses and interrogative clauses
(discussed in 2.6, 2.7 and especially 4.6), as is clear from a comparison of
the following clauses, where NgCFT stands for negative counterfactual.

in toxopòmu ‘some’. Scattered over the book, Drabbe gives severalexamples of stress shift to the prefinal syllable caused by “a strong
connection between a word and another element.” A case in question is
the sequence sì-ke nisi [build-N1.RLS[SG]] ‘the one who builds’, wherestress has shifted from the suffix -ke to the stem (cf. Drabbe 1957:11).","[38, 39]"
"282PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureNote that most of the verbs listed above have, in addition to the
experiencer, an additional argument that may seem to function as a subject.
In this respect, it is interesting to compare the following pairs:
(457) anukekinoxomi-ke1SGACCtearcome.down-N1.RLS[SG]‘I got tears in my eyes’ (Drabbe 1957:24a)
bjoxotekinoxomi-ke-nã3PLNOMtearcome.down-N1.RLS-N1PL‘They go tears in their eyes (Drabbe 1957:24a)It is very well possible to think of kinoxo in (457) a as the subject. Its status
in the b- example, however, is harder to define. If we consider joxo te as
the subject — which is what I would propose, given its marking asnominative and the agreement with the verb — what then is the status ofkinoxo? I will leave this question for further research.
While the verbs described so far obligatorily behave as experiential verbs,
the language also has a number of verbs where the use of an experiential
construction is optional. Drabbe gives only one expression as an
illustration, presenting the following alternation:
(458) anügukunuŋgi-d-oã/nügukunuŋgi-ke1PLfatiguebecome-1.RLS-1PL1PLfatiguebecome-n1.RLS[SG]‘we are sleepy’ (Drabbe 1957:24a)In the text corpus no examples of experiential constructions were found.","[299, 300]"
"Very similar to the nonverbal clauses discussed in the previous session are
those which are formed with the use of the copula verb ki(k) ‘become’.
Following Dixon’s analysis of copula clauses, one could consider theseclauses as headed by a copula verb ki(k) which takes two complements: a
copula subject and a copula complement (Dixon 2010b:159f). This copula
can be a noun, an adjective or a numeral. Unlike the copula clauses
discussed above, the verb can be inflected not also for person and number
of the subject, but also for tense and mood, which makes that the clauses
under discussion here can also be used to invoke a future interpretation.
When combined with adjectives or numerals, the copula may be interpretednominal question clauses, namely by means of da xajo. Drabbe’s description contains no
examples, however.
211Drabbe does not refer to a as a copula, but as “possibly not more than a ligature”, andrefers to the use of a in questioning verbs (see 2.7).",[311]
"In the following two sentences, makumaŋ and manmaŋ are used as copula
complements. Drabbe gives no example of makumu here, which might
again be seen as a confirmation of the more adverbial nature of makumu (as
the language has no other examples of adverbial copula complements) and
the more nominal nature of makumaŋ and mamaŋ.

bgetofimakumaŋgedeyour.fathernamehow/where/whenFOCCOP‘what’s your father’s name?’ (Drabbe 1957:28a)In addition to the verbal noun makumã, Drabbe also points at the existence
of a question verb makumu ‘do what’. To illustrate its use, Drabbe contrasts
the verb makumoxenã to the homophonous makum= oxenã, as illustrated
in (298) and (299) below.

the entire text collection, all lexical material, and the grammatical analysis
of Drabbe (1957) available to a wider public, including those who are not
competent in Dutch. Although the present book is entirely based on Drabbe
(1957), and generally follows his grammatical analysis rather closely, at
points I have added some of my own insights, or tried to make a connection
with relevant developments in linguistic theory that have taken place since
the Fifties (e.g. a growing understanding of clause chaining and switch
reference).
This adaptation has been written as part of the project The Awyu Dumutfamily of Papuan languages in its linguistic and cultural context. In this
project the different languages that are part of the Greater Awyu language
group have been compared, and documented in more detail.5 At times, I
have made reference to other publications that have resulted from this
project, especially where new insights shed light on analytical problems
within Aghu.
Great care has been taken to indicate clearly in the text where my analysis
differs from Drabbe’s. At the same time, in order to enhance the
comparison between this book and the original, each section closes with a
list of references to the corresponding sections in Drabbe (1957). The
structure of this book follows that of Drabbe: Part I, consisting of chapters5This project took place at the VU University of Amsterdam, and was supported by De NederlandseOrganisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, reference number 380-89-020.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

pronouns obligatorily combine with te or ke. In this respect, they differ
from nouns, where the use of te or ke is optional. The difference between
the use of te and ke is not clear, but their function is clearly not to
differentiate between different syntactic roles. It is more likely that their use
has to do with the type of focus, but we have insufficient data to say
anything more about the respective roles of ke and te with any certainty.155

word] differs from the presupposition [WvdH: the fact that there is someone]’ (cf.
Lambrecht 1994:213). This may explain the use of ke. Whereas te is not a focus marker, it
is not incompatible with focus, and it is not unthinkable that te would represent a different
tye of focus than ke, like presentational or thetic focus, with the focus on the predicate as a
whole. With the little data that we have, however, we can only speculate about this
difference.","[217, 218]"
"Before we go deeper into to the distributional properties of verbal nouns,
first some words need to be devoted to their semantics. If we take a verb
with a basic lexical meaning X, a verbal noun formed from lexeme X
usually refers to ‘the activity or event of X-ing’. With certain verbs,
however, the verbal noun may also refer to what Drabbe calls the result of a
process (1957:15), or to what could tentatively be called the ‘effected
49That stems in e have verbal nouns in ã or ẽ with different distribution raises the questionwhether it wouldn’t make more sense to speak of two types of ‘verbal nouns’ with
different function. For stems in e these two types would then be distinguished formally,
while for stems that end in other vowels the types would have no formal distinction.
Before deciding to reanalyze Drabbe’s data at this point, one would first have to considerthe question whether the alternation between ã and ẽ could not be explained on the basis of
the phonological environment in which the two alternants are used (vowel harmony, stress
pattern). As the data are too limited to investigate the influence of the phonological
environment, however, I have decided to follow Drabbe’s analysis.
50More precisely, Drabbe speaks of ‘nominal use of the future stem’. Drabbe’s formulationbetrays two aspects where the analysis here differs from his: (1) where he speaks of future
stems, we speak of irrealis stems or stems of type II; (2) for Drabbe, the forms under
discussion coincide with the stem, as for him the future stems or stems of type II discussed
in 2.2, Table 3, end in a nasal, cf. also footnote 33.",[72]

gives is the following:
(274)meoxojoxotedewho3PLNOMCOP‘who are they’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)Drabbe points out that meoxo cannot express ‘what kind of’. From this and
from the fact that he does not give any examples of adnominal (or:
attributive) use of meoxo, we may conclude that meoxo can only be used
independently. In this respect it differs from makeaxe ‘what’, which may be
used both pronominally and adnominally and to which we now turn.
First consider the following examples, which exemplify the use of makeaxe
in a nominal clause. It is important to note that here we do not find the
focus markers te or ke, which are obligatory in analogous sentences withmeoxo, like (266)a-c above. The examples below are sufficient evidence to
show that the particles are not obligatory. Drabbe nowhere states, however,PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes203that the markers cannot be used, so we must remain ignorant with regard to
the question whether it is indeed impossible to use them.

constituents is often a matter of interpretation by the language user (Booij
2005:75). Language users have to interpret the relationship on the basis of
the meaning of the composing parts, their knowledge of the world, and
sometimes on the basis of the context. At the same time, one may think of
certain types of compounds as imposing a ‘semantic scheme’ on the
composing parts and or on the resultant meaning. This scheme may be
rather loose, and put only few restrictions on the possible range of
constituents, or rather strict, allowing only for certain constituents, and
specifying the semantic relation between the parts as well as the meaning of
the whole. If we compare the two types of compounds in Aghu, it seems
that those of type 2 are more specific or answer to a stricter scheme than
those of type 1. For compounds of type 2, Drabbe gives the following three
subtypes, with a strictly defined range of possible constituents — fillers ofthe N1 and N2 positions in the figure below — and a strictly defined
relation between the two composing parts. . Drabbe is not explicit about thequestion whether the modifying elements in these compounds are also
attested as separate words.","[163, 164]"
"242PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesThe case markers te and ke were dealt with in 3.1.7, where it was shown
that they answer all three criteria mentioned here: they are used
postnominally, they mark the (semantic or) syntactic relation between the
predicate and the noun, and their use is optional. We now turn to a
discussion of the other postpositional case markers.","[259, 260]"
"30PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: VerbsFormally, realis forms are characterized by the use of a stem of type I plus
one of the dedicated realis markers d(e) or ke, which in finite forms are
sometimes fused with markers for tense. Functionally, the opposition
between realis and irrealis has to do with the actualization of events: realis
forms portray situations as ‘actualized’, as having occurred or actuallyoccurring’ (Mithun 1999:173), while the irrealis portrays situations as not
actualized (yet), existing purely within the realm of thought. Nonfinite verb
forms are morphologically and functionally simplest, allowing only for the
marking of ‘same subject’ (SS), which indicates that the subject of the verb
is the same as the subject of the following verb (see 2.3.2.1 below). They
are not marked for person and number of the subject, and there is no realisirrealis distinction. Somewhat more complex are semifinite verbs, which
inflect for person and number of the subject, and which distinguish — as
described above — between realis and irrealis mood. Most complex, finally,
are the fully finite verbs, which mark the same categories as the semifinite
verbs, plus the category of tense.
Grammatical tense plays only a minor role in Aghu. Although the language
has a category of fully finite verbs, which bear a formal expression of tense
(historical past, distant past or future), these finite verbs are attested very
rarely in the texts available to us. The texts contain only four cases of a
future tense, historical past verbs are attested only in the concluding
sections of the narratives, while distant past tense forms are found
predominantly in contexts where the distant past meaning has bleached (cf.
2.3.3.1 example (65); 2.4.3.3 examples (105) and (107)). It is important to
be aware, however, that the text corpus is highly biased, as it contains only
very little direct speech. In fact, all four examples of future tense forms in
the text corpus are found in quoted direct speech, which makes it very
likely that investigation of Aghu daily conversation would yield a much
higher frequency of future forms compared to the frequency in Drabbe’sPART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs31corpus. Whether this is also true for the different past tenses is a question
that cannot be answered.
Coming to aspect, iterativity and habituality are expressed by suffixation to
the verbal stem, which can then be used as the basis for nonfinite,
semifinite or finite verbs (2.4.1 and 2.4.2). Durative aspect, on the other
hand, can be expressed morphologically in semifinite and finite verbs, by
the use of durative affixes that attach to the inflected verb; i- ‘DUR’ attaches
to inflected realis verbs, while -ke attaches to inflected irrealis verbs (see
2.4.3.1). Durative aspect can also be expressed by the use of a procliticbu= (2.4.3.2), or by syntactic constructions formed with posture verbs
(2.4.3.3). Special forms of the posture verbs are used in the formation of
continuative constructions, which express long or very long duration
(2.4.3.4).
There do not seem to be systematic morphological differences between
intransitive and transitive verbs (except from a single affix -ni~nü that
seems to occur on intransitive verbs only, see Table 3 below). For the
syntax of intransitive and transitive clauses the reader is referred to section
4.12.2 Stems of type I and type II: form
Drabbe 1957: section 25-26, p. 12-14; section 19, p. 9-10As to their morphophonological structure, stems of type I can be divided
into three types:32PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: VerbsType a:[...Ṽ]stem_I: stems ending in a nasal vowelType b:[...V] stem_I: stems ending in a non-nasal vowelType c:[...mV]stem_I: complex verbs in -mV ‘do’32Stems of type II, on the other hand, all end in a non-nasal front vowel, so
that their phonological make-up can be presented as follows:
[…V front] stem_II33
All stems of type II, then, end in i, e or ü. Although the form of the stems
of type II cannot be fully predicted from the form of stems of type I or vice
versa, and therefore have to be listed in the lexicon, there are some clear
patterns. These have been summed up in the following correspondence
table, where the second and the third columns give the patterns and the last
column gives examples. Note that for each stem of type I, the form of the
32Stems of type Ic end in -mV, which is an affix related to the verb ame ‘make, do’ andderived from PAD *emo ‘do, make’. In these complex stems, the final vowel harmonizeswith the preceding vowel. Drabbe remarks that mV is also attested in other ‘Awyulanguages’, where it also has the meaning ‘do’; compare the wordlist in Appendix A ofWester (2014). Affixation with -mV often has a transitivizing function. For the PAD form*emo see Voorhoeve (2005: 152). Note that Aghu also has an auxiliary verb mV, which
we will meet in 2.3.2.2.5.
33It should be noted that my analysis at this point differs from the analysis by Drabbe. Inhis view, all stems of type II end in a nasal vowel. In his analysis, then, it is the bare
stem_II that is used for N1SG (see Table 4), while in all other cases the stem is denasalized.
In my view, a system in which the final vowel of stem_II is not intrinsically nasal is
simpler than the system proposed by Drabbe and therefore to be preferred. Moreover,
although the Aghu system should, in the first place, be analyzed on independent and
synchronic grounds, it is still noteworthy that the analysis of type II stems as ending in a
non-nasal vowel seems to make more sense in a historical-comparative perspective. First,
none of the other Awyu languages have nasalization as a feature of stems of type II.
Second, the nasalization in N1SG — see Table 4 below — can be explained from proto-Awyu *-en ‘N1SG.IRR’ (cf. De Vries ea. 2012: 282, where the authors reconstruct *-en (
but follow Drabbe in characterizing Aghu as having nasal irrealis stems)).","[47, 48, 49, 50]"
"300PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureThe most convincing arguments in favor of ke and te as case markers are
the following. First, Drabbe gives some contrastive examples in which the
markers serve to disambiguate between the syntactic roles of subject and
object. A very convincing example, which was given in 3.1.5 and is
repeated here, is the following:
(523)anan-amset=ed-oxe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childNOMgive-N1.RLS-N1PL‘my children gave it’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
bnan-amsek=ed-oxe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childACCgive-N1.RLS-N1PL‘they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)Second, the case markers are in complementary distribution with other case
markers, discussed in 3.6.
Nevertheless, the case markers are somewhat atypical. First, they are
optional, so that the following sentence, minimally differing from (523)a
and b, is also grammatical.
cnan-amseed-oxe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childgive-N1.RLS-N1PL‘my children gave it / they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)Their optional nature raises the question about the precise motivation for
their use. One might hypothesize that they are used only when an NP’s
function is not clear from the context. This cannot explain, however, why it
is also possible to use these markers in case the verb has only one
argument, whose role can only be that of a subject, as in the following
example:PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure
(524)nan-amseteda-xe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childNOMcome-N1.RLS-N1PL301‘my children have come’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)This example shows that the use of te cannot fully be explained from its
function as disambiguator between the syntactic roles of subject and object;
it must also have a pragmatic function. As our data are too limited — we
especially lack minimally contrastive examples and descriptions of their
meaning differences — we have to remain ignorant about the nature of this
pragmatic function. In verbal clauses, therefore, we analyze te and ke as
case markers, the use of which is also guided by pragmatic factors that
remain to be investigated.216
In nonverbal clauses, the use of te and ke again is optional, except in
clauses with meoxo ‘who’ as a subject, where it is obligatory.217 As was
shown in 4.2, both te and ke may be used either in subject position or as
marker of the copula complement. Te is consistently analyzed as a
nominative marker. Ke, however, is analyzed as a a focus marker. This
shown in the following table:
Table 54: Analysis of ke and te in nonverbal clauseste, analyzed aske analyzed asIn subject positionNominative case markerFocus markerAs a complementNominative case markerFocus markerConsidering ke in subject position, my main argument to analyze it as a
focus marker is of a negative nature, in that it is hard to think of ke as an
accusative marker:
216An interesting example of the use of ke is found in 3.024, which was cited in 4.1 above,example (452).

"When nouns are used as subject of a verb, we find an interesting
discrepancy between more animate and less animate nouns. For more
animate nouns, referring to bigger animals and human beings, subject
inflection on the verb is either singular or plural. This means that for thesePART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes163more animate nouns the interpretation of the NP as referring to a singular
entity or more entities is guided by the inflection on the verb (optionally
supported by the use of joxo ‘3PL’ directly following the noun, see 3.1.5.5).
Compare the following two examples, where the verb of the first example
exhibits singular inflection, and the verb of the second example plural
inflection.

Especially for nouns referring to larger objects and trees, reference to164PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesmultiple entities may but need not be expressed by plural inflection. The
situation can be visualized as follows:
Humans; larger animals; ?smaller animals; trees; larger objects; smaller objects; mass nouns 122plural subject inflection on verb
singular subject inflection on verb
Figure 13: Animacy and the use of plural subject inflection on the verbIn the figure above, the question mark indicates that the precise behavior of
the respective category is not clear. The use of dashed instead of closed
lines indicates that the borders between the categories are not clear. In
sentence 10 below, for example, we find two nouns that refer to smaller
objects, which nevertheless combine with plural inflection. I would
hypothesize that here plural inflection is used because of the strong
association with animacy; it might even be that here the genitals, as it were,
represent or stand for the persons themselves.

(2.133)122The choice for singular inflection in (195) and (196) above could be explained on theassumption that the sago crumbs and the fruits are conceived of not as multiple individual
objects, but as a collective whole. This might be taken as an argument in favor of an
analysis in which it is ‘individuation’ rather than animacy that underlies the hierarchy; for

If we study the text corpus as published in Drabbe (1957), it is clear that for
Drabbe, Aghu clauses generally combine into larger units: A sentence,

comprises more than one clause. Some sentences are subdivided

"102PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbsfully become part of the construction, but should rather be seen as a strong
contextual implication. If we find a nonfinite V1, followed by a verb of
posture V2, there is a strong implication of (1) overlap between V1 and V2,
and (2) a durative reading of (V1+V2). Examples like (111) below,
however, show that the question whether this reading really holds, is still
dependent on the context.

The construction described above can also be used for the description of
alternating processes like ‘coming and going’, or ‘going up and down’
(Drabbe 1957:35). As can be seen in (112), one uses subsequent nonfinite
forms of two verbs that express movements in opposite directions, which
then are followed by a semifinite or finite form of the posture verb.
(112)xo-do=kda-de=ke-d-oãgo-SS=CONcome-SS=CONstand-1.RLS-1PL‘we were continuously walking there and back again’ (Drabbe 1957:35a)An alternative way of expressing this kind of alternating processes is

semifinite motion verb.

may use a compound verb formed from the primary stems of the two
motion verbs, again followed by a posture verb (here a continuative stem of
e ‘stand’, see following section). Drabbe remarks, however, that such
compounds seem to be rare, and gives only the following clause to
exemplify this type of compound and its use:
(114)ogo-madaeme-de=kmeme-d-oãgo.up-come.downstop-SS=CONstay.CONT_I-1.RLS-1PL‘We were continuously going up and down’ (Drabbe 1957:35a)2.4.3.4 Different degrees of longer duration, expressed by affixation
Drabbe 1957: sections 86-89, p. 34-36; section 99, p. 40-41Drabbe explains how different degrees of duration can be expressed by the
use of different stems that are derived from the stems ba(x) ‘sit’, i(g) ‘lie’,and e(k) ‘stand’. As presented in the table below, continuative_I forms are
used to express longer duration than a normal durative, while
continuative_II forms are used to portray an even longer duration. Note that
the continuative meaning is part of the derived verb, both when it is used as
an independent posture verb, and when it is used in a durative construction
as described in the previous section and exemplified in (118) below.

verbs in the first column and the verbal affix -mV ‘do’, and are inflected in
line with this, taking -oxe as the N1.RLS marker (cf. 2.3.1.1). Also in line
with this, they have corresponding stems of type II in e (see Table 3, type c
above), so that the stems of type II have the same form as those of type I.
The continuative_II forms all contain the suffix -bax, which is, most
probably, historically related to the verb ba (x) ‘sit’.76 The meaning ‘sit’ is
bleached for the suffix -bax, but still part of the meaning of the verbal rootsba and bam, analogous to what we saw for the posture verbs discussed in
the previous section; the use of the root ba and its derivatives implies that
the subject is sitting, while e and i are used for standing and lying subjects,
respectively. Thus, (115) refers to an activity of longer duration where the
subject of the verb is in standing position, while (116) uses bam ‘sit.CONT1’
as a main verb to refer to subjects in sitting position, or more specifically:
to subjects that are conceptualized of as usually finding themselves in a
sitting position (cf. 2.8.1 below).

‘They remain busy placing (the fish traps) for a while and then come, they come

Table 32 (inflection of posture verbs) below, however, it is clear that the forms areinflected differently. Compare bo-de [sit-1.RLS[SG] ] ‘I sit’ with bambox-o [sit.CONT_II-1SG] ‘I sit continuously, I stay’ (and not * bam-bo-de).","[119, 120, 121, 122]"
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes1773.2 Pronouns
3.2.1 Independent pronouns and emphatic pronouns:
form
Drabbe 1957: section 11-12, p. 6a-7aThe forms of the free pronouns are as follows. Their function will be
discussed in detail below, but it is relevant to note here that the use of efe
and joxo is restricted to humans and animals, except when the former is
used as possessive pronoun in the construction described in 3.1.2.
Table 41: Aghu independent pronouns
SGPL1nunügu2gu3efe / ekegügu
136joxoDrabbe discusses various ways in which pronouns can be modified, many
of which, however, are not attested in the text corpus.137 What needs to be
136According to Drabbe, the basic form of the 3SG pronoun is efe, while eke is analyzed asa contracted form of efe + ke. Wester (2014:71) gives both efe and eke as Aghu 3SG
pronouns, and derives the latter form from pA *eke. She also writes that the form efe (or
ewe in Shiaxa and Yenimu) “could well have originated in an Awyu-Dumut deictic
element ep or e ‘there’.” Irrespective of the question whether these reconstructions are
correct, it is clear that efe and eke synchronically have different functions. More on this
can be found in 3.2.3.2.
137Drabbe (1957:7a) mentions the following. (1) ku ‘EMP’ (discussed in the text above) canbe followed by gedeme, which further emphasizes the concept of ‘self’: nu ku gedeme
‘1SG-EMP EMP’. (2) Emphatic pronouns can also be followed by a pronoun of same personplus namu, which has the same meaning as the construction with gedeme: nu-ku nu-namu
‘1SG-EMP 1SG-EMP’. (3) Instead of emphatic oku following the pronoun, speakers may also
use okagi or okagimu. (4) Drabbe points to the use of emphatic pronouns in certainnominal clauses: ok’ iman e-ke [3SG.EMP EMP stand-N1.RLS[SG]] or ok’ iman ba-xe [EMPEMP sit-N1.RLS[SG]] ‘that’s how he is’. In these examples, the posture verbs e ‘stand’ and178PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesmentioned here, however, is the use of the emphatic suffix -ku ‘EMP’, which
may follow the 1SG, 2SG or 3PL pronouns. In 3SG the form oku is used,
which Drabbe tentatively analyzes as a contracted form of efe and ku.138
The forms of 1SG and 2SG plus -ku are also used for reference to plural
speakers and addressees, so that we get the following paradigm:
Table 42: Emphatic pronouns1

3SGPLnuku
guku
okujoxokuThe emphatic pronouns from Table 42 alternate with oku followed by the
independent pronouns of Table 41. In other words, oku nu ‘EMP 1SG’ hasthe same distribution and meaning as nu-ku ‘1SG-EMP’; oku gu ‘EMP 2SG’ isidentical in meaning and distribution to gu-ku ‘2SG-EMP’, and ok’ eke
alternates with oku. The form oku therefore seems to show traces of a
diachronic development from ‘3SG-EMP’ to a grammatical formativeunspecified for person, to be glossed as ‘EMP’.139 In this book, the form is
glossed either as 3SG-EMP or as EMP, dependent on its position.ba ‘sit’ function as a copulas, cf. 2.8.2. (5) In possessive phrases we find nu namu na büsiü
[1SG only 1SG.POS house ] ‘my own house, a house belonging to me only’; eke namu efe
büsiü [3SG.FOC only 3SG house ] ‘his own house’, or oku ga büsiü ke de [EMP 2SG.POS
house FOC COP ] ‘it is your own house’.
138I have used the term ‘tentatively’ here to make clear that Drabbe notes the ambiguitybetween 3SG reading of oku, and one in which it is used to strengthen other than 3 rd person
pronouns; see the discussion below.
139Alternatively, one might hypothesize that * oku is the basic form, which, in a positionafter pronouns — which are all vowel-final — developed into a suffix -ku. In third person
singular, the form oku might either be suppletive for the 3SG pronoun + oku, or be the
result of a contraction between *oku and a 3SG proto pronoun (which has now become
lost).","[194, 195, 196]"

"Petrus Drabbe (1887-1970) was a missionary of the Holy Heart, who
worked between 1912 and 1960 in the Philippines, the Moluccan Tanimbar
islands, and, from 1935 onwards, on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea
(present West Papua, Indonesia). As Drabbe appeared to have a great skill
for language learning and language description, his mission decided to
appoint him as a ‘mission linguist’, which meant that he could devote most
of his time to the analysis and description of local languages. Over a period
of 25 years, Drabbe described over ten different languages in more or less
detail, Aghu being only one of them.
Drabbe’s description of Aghu started off as a follow up to an earlier articleon the Pisa and Sjiagha “dialects of the Awyu language” (Drabbe 1950). In
the preface to Spraakkunst van het Aghu, Drabbe writes that after
publication of the respective article, he was asked from different sides to
provide original material to illustrate the “grammatical rules.” In answer to
this question, Drabbe started collecting texts in what he calls “a third
dialect of the Awyu language”, with the aim to publish them as an
illustration of his 1950 article. During the process of collection, however,
Drabbe discovered that the dialect was so different from the other two, that
the texts could not serve the original aim, and even justified the publication
of a separate language description or spraakkunst:
“Hereby we offer this [language description] to the practitioners of linguistics, together
with some texts as an appendix, with interlinear literal translation and some notes”1
1“We bieden die thans de beoefenaars der taalwetenschap aan, tezamen met een aantal tekstenals aanhangsel, en wel met interlineaire letterlijke vertaling en enige nota’s.” (Drabbe 1957:iii)v
From the study of Drabbe’s work, I have come to know Drabbe as an
outstanding scholar, with a fine eye for the character and own ‘peculiarity’of individual languages. As a Roman Catholic priest, Drabbe had received a
decent training in classical languages, and it is this background that
provided Drabbe with the tools he used to produce his language
descriptions. The fact that Drabbe had not received a formal linguistic
training at academic level, at times seems to have been a cause of tension in
the contemporary acceptance of his work. The following 1957 preface gives
some insight into the dynamics of this discussion, and may also serve as a
justification of the present ‘re-publication’ of Drabbe’s work.
“There is another desire which, unfortunately, also this time we couldn’t fulfill. One would
want us to provide many and exact phonetic data about the languages whose grammatical
structure we analyze and describe; ideally, one would like to see these data accompanied
by an analysis of the phonological structure. We fully acknowledge this desire as justified,
but are not capable to meet this desire, as we know that we are not competent. Although it
is, in principle, possible to learn what one does not know, given our age and the amount of
work it would take to do such a study, which — if one wants it to lead to the desiredresults — would take a lot of time, we think we serve the interests of our mission — our
primary aim — better if we spend the rest of the time that will be given to us in the same
way as before. Although we acknowledge the desire mentioned above as justified, and
although we acknowledge that our work will also in the future, seen from a scientific
perspective, contain a gap, we are nevertheless of the opinion — and we are not alone in
this — that our labour is not without merit for linguistics.”2
2“Aan een andere wens konden we helaas ook ditmaal niet voldoen. Men zou gaarne zien, dat we inruime mate exacte fonetische gegevens verstrekten over de talen, waarvan we de grammaticale
grondstructuur ontleden en beschrijven; liefst zou men deze gegevens nog vergezeld zien gaan van
een analyse der fonologische structuur. We erkennen ten volle het rechtmatige van dit verlangen,
maar zijn niet bij machte eraan tegemoet te komen, daar we ons incompetent weten. Weliswaar kan
men leren wat men niet weet, doch gezien enerzijds onze leeftijd en anderzijds de omvang van een
dergelijke studie, die — wil ze tot de gewenste resultaten leiden — geruime tijd in beslag zou nemen,menen we de belangen van het missiewerk — ons eerste doel — beter te dienen, door de tijd die ons
nog geschonken zal worden, te besteden als voorheen. Het rechtmatige van bovengenoemd verlangen
erkennend, en toegevend, dat ons werk ook in de toekomst, van wetenschappelijk standpunt bekeken,
een lacune zal blijven vertonen, menen we toch — en we staan daarin niet alleen — dat onze arbeidniet zonder waarde is voor de taalwetenschap.” (Drabbe 1957:iii)viDrabbe concludes his preface with the following words:
“Where our opponent [Prof E.M. Ühlenbeck] rightly signals the lack of exact phoneticsigns as a lacuna in our work — but, in our opinion, values this too highly — his judgment
should be explained not out of prejudice or bias, but out of his great enthusiasm for
structural linguistics. We can fully appreciate this enthusiasm, as we too consider a
structural analysis to be necessary, if one really wants to bring all secrets of a language to
the surface of conscious knowledge. We would therefore be delighted if the work, with
which we only made a beginning, would, in this spirit, be brought to completion by
others.”3Although this book does not work within the paradigm of structural
linguistics that was current in the Fifties, it shares the same enthusiasm to
bring all secrets of the Aghu language, as hidden in this Spraakkunst, to the
surface. Not only to be seen by those who are competent in Dutch or those
who manage to get hold of a copy, but by all those who, with Drabbe,
would like to know more about this language, because
“Each language is a fascinating miracle, and because it is an intense joy to analyzesuch a miracle, as one repeatedly does new and unexpected discoveries.” 43Waar onze opponent het ontbreken van exacte fonetische gegevens terecht signaleert als een lacunein ons werk, doch naar onze mening dit al te zwaar laat wegen, moet zijn oordeel verklaard worden
niet uit vooringenomenheid of partijdigheid, maar uit zijn grote enthousiasme voor de structurele
taalwetenschap, een enthousiasme, dat we ten volle kunnen waarderen, omdat ook wij een structurele
analyse als noodzakelijk beschouwen, wil men uiteindelijk erin slagen alle geheimen van een taal aan
de oppervlakte der bewuste kennis te brengen. Het zou ons dan ook ten zeerste verheugen, wanneer
anderen de arbeid, waarmede wij slechts een aanvang maakten, in deze geest zouden kunnen
voltooien” (Drabbe 1957:iv).
4“…[omdat] iedere taal een boeiend wonder is, en het een intens genoegen is zo een wonder teontleden, doordat men telkens nieuwe en onverwachte ontdekkingen doet” (Drabbe 1965: 27).","[5, 6, 7]"
