(3214)ha'?ã
u'ru
here!
patua
‘look, here are patua seeds!’hӻ?ӻ ‘yes, O.K.’. As a positive minimal response, hͿ'?Ϳ ‘yes, O.K.’ is used.
The second syllable bears the accent. It can also be pronounced as hã'?ã, hã'hã,
hy'?Ϳ, “hmhm” or Ϳ'hͿ. It is also a positive minimal response to commands.
Roquette-Pinto (1950:152) attributes the wide diffusion of “Hum! Hum!” in
this function among Brazilians, esp. in Mato-Grosso and Rondônia, to Indian
influence.
tse ‘yes’. Another positive minimal response is tse ‘yes’, sometimes pronounced as [se]. It is used much in family II. It is not to be confused with the
interjection tsİh ‘why!’ or the declarative morpheme -tse.
(3215)Q: wa'txi-re
true-INT
‘would it be true?’A: tse
yes
‘yes’hӻ?ӻ ‘no’. As a negative minimal response, 'hͿ?Ϳ ‘no’ is used. The first syllable has a higher pitch than the second one and it also bears the accent. The
vowel of the second syllable is often long.
hӻhӻ ‘I don’t know’. As a minimal negative answer to a question hͿ'hͿ ‘I don’t

is a reassuring reply to comment or a warning about someone else:

A: ƭ'nƭ
O.K.
eat-again-want-DEC
‘he (said he) is going to eat again’
‘let him!’, ‘it’s O.K.!’It seems possible that the part -nƭ of ƭnƭ is etymologically related to the exhortative morpheme -ni and the part ƭ- to the pronoun ƭ ‘he’.","[641, 642]"
"7.1. Negation5277.1.1.4. Negation in different moods
Negation in the declarative and interrogative moods is relatively transparent.
The negative morpheme is generally inserted in a position before the mood
marker without any further adaptations:
(2796)ja-'he-da-ki
eat-NEG-1S-DEC
‘I did not eat’Questions can be asked in a negative form, and a negative response yields a
logically positive answer:
(2797)Q: mãrİ̘ri'tsa ja-'he-xa-re
person
eat-NEG-2-INT
‘do(n’t) you eat people?’A: hã'?ã (ja)-'he-da-ki

‘yes (it is)’(2799)Q: atsile-'he-tsy-re
heavy-NEG-GER-INT
‘isn’t it very heavy?’A: ha'?ã

‘yes (it isn’t)’Person-negative order also occurs in the interrogative. It questions a negative presupposition held by the speaker:

in the forest!”?’303 (t)(2801)be-tara-'ni-xa-he-re
ripe-PROC-CAUS-2-NEG-INT
‘why don’t you wait for (the fruit) to ripen?’The following example of a countersupposition is formally interrogative, but
not semantically. The interrogative is used emphatically here:303.Note that the glossing of -ni as exhortative represents a literal interpretation of a construction that may be also analysed as causational (like in the next example).","[564, 565]"
"5.5. Tense, modality and aspect(2269)atsile-'he-tjara-re
(*'atsiletjara're)
heavy-NEG-PROC-INT
‘it isn’t very heavy is it?’(2270)dehe-'he-tjara-re
bitter-NEG-PROC-INT
‘it isn’t very bitter, is it?’443In a way -tjara- in the latter two examples can also be interpreted as semantically related to ‘fortunately’. It so happens both questions anticipate a reassuring answer. Example (2269) was uttered in the context of someone wanting the
speaker to carry something, but the speaker was in doubt, because the item to
be carried looked rather heavy. Example (2270) was uttered in the context of
someone wanting the speaker to drink medicine. Especially children abhor bitter tastes. Note that the said positive equivalents (2252) and (2253) also have a
modal connotation of ‘fortunately’. Here is one more, elliptic, example:
(2271)'he-tjara-ki
NEG-PROC-DEC
‘it isn’t dirty!’, ‘don’t worry!’, ‘nothing wrong!’, ‘doesn’t matter!’Instead of the expected -tara-, we find -tjara- in the examples of the present
section. This strongly reminds of the variation between cosubordinative -ta and
-tja as discussed in (8.3.1.4.). This is corroborated by the fact that -tjara- is incompatible with non-third person forms. Compare the following example to
(2268):
(2272)txa'nã kui-'he-da-tara-re
drink-NEG-1S-PROC-INT
we.IN
‘good that I did not drink (it)!’ (it was poisoned)So, one could ask whether -tara- is actually discontinuous. Would it not be
better to analyse it as a clause-final cosubordinative -ta, which is then followed
by an unidentified verb ra- of modal content? And, would this have consequences for the analysis of all examples in the present section (5.5.19.)? Under
such an analysis, e.g. (2214) should be analysed as a biclausal construction:
(2273)'ja-da-ta
'ra-tse
eat-1S-CSO ???-DEC
‘I’ll eat later’The fact that ra- bears stress here could be used in support of its interpretation
as a verbal root. However, there are very many instances of ra- without stress,
to begin with (2215). Furthermore, -tara- can be omitted, together with the
sense of ‘to do later’, as if it were an indivisible suffix:4445. The verb phrase(2274)o'kja-a-'xa-(tara)-tsy-hͿ-he're=jã-re
(see 8.1.1.3.)
hunt-1P-AS-PROC-POT-NOM-APPL=be-INT
‘we are still going to hunt! (but we’re too busy now)’Finally, no clearly identifiable verb root of the form ra- was attested. One
could assume the existence of such a root, by analysing ra- as ‘to be’ or ‘to become’. With some imagination, rahͿki in example (2256) can be ascribed the
sense of ‘to be certainly’, ratsytse in (2220) ‘to be potentially’, ramͿ in (2245)
‘I to be’ and so on. But then one would also expect elliptic occurrences of this
construction, in which a context like e.g. the question ‘when are you going to
eat?’ allows for a minimal answer, such as ratse ‘it will be’. However, such elliptic answers always include the preceding person marker and -ta-, as in
(2223).
There is actually one verb root of the form ra-. It is apparently based on the
imperative mood morpheme -ra. It occurs only in combination with a subsequent transitiviser -tja- and means ‘to order (him)’:
(2275)ra'tja-ki
(2276)
order-DEC
‘he ordered him’, ‘he’s insisting’İ-'nƭ-da-ta ra'tja-da-ki
go-CAUS-1S-CSO order-1S-DEC
‘I ordered him to go home’Another form based on imperative -ra is elliptic, and contains a preceding emphatic imperative morpheme -ca- (which is also pronounced as [tja]). It functions as a positive minimal answer to an offer or a declaration of intention:
(2277)ca-'ra
EMP-IMP
‘yes! / it is O.K. / do so!’I assume that these imperative constructions have nothing to do with any analysis of the procrastinative -t(j)ara-. They are discussed further in (5.5.11.1.).
5.5.19.4. Tentative conclusion
For the time being, I have considered -tara- and -tjara- as variants of the same
modal/aspectual suffix. It may be that both are fossilisations of formerly discontinuous elements in a fixed type of expression containing a modal verb.
In the following table I give an overview of the distributional and semantic
properties of -tara-, according to their order of occurrence in the discussions
above, with reference to primary examples.","[480, 481, 482]"
"2585. The verb phrase5.1.3. Exclusive reference
In section (4.7.2.), reference was made to the occurrence of “incompatible”
combination of the inclusive pronoun with exclusive cross-reference marking
was noticed:
(1100)tja'nã
ƭle'le-a-xa-ki
together-1P-AS-DEC
we.IN
‘we are together (married/brother-sister/kin)’(1101)txa'nã / tsi'tsİ
Ǌ'ce-a-xa-hͿ-ki
arǊi-'du-a-xa-ta
/ we.EX trap-1P-AS-NOM-DEC tapir-BER-1P-AS-CSO
we.IN
‘(it is) we who made a trap for a tapir’It is unclear what the function of these “incompatible” combinations is. One
could imagine that (1100) has an affective connotation, or that the exclusion of
the hearer is emphasised. Or maybe the examples reflect evasive use of the distinction, i.e. one tries to avoid to be specific. The choice between pronouns in
(1101) is not problematic as far as the nature of interrogative context is regarded: this utterance was the answer to a question and the person who asked
the question is by definition excluded from the proposition, because otherwise
he would not have asked. Note that the combination of exclusive tsitsİ with inclusive -a- inflexion tends to be considered really ungrammatical, so there is an
asymmetry:
Table 24. Compatibility of inclusive and exclusive reference

¥The fact that only the exclusive was accepted in:

'mİ̘-a-xa-ki
we.EX beat-1P-AS-DEC
‘we’re hitting (him)’whereas: *tjana mͅ?axaki and *tjana mͅ?aki were rejected altogether, can be
explained by pragmatic anomaly, as here it could be argued that it is very unusual to make a remark “we’re beating him up” to a participant in the action. It
is more natural to utter this phrase to a bystander, e.g. as an answer to his or her
questions about what is going on.","[295, 296]"

‘I killed it with a scythe’Optional ellipsis of cross-reference marking only was attested in predicates
which are cosubordinated to an interrogative matrix clause:
(3114)ã'wͿi-(xa)-ta 'nãi-xa-re
like-2-INT
see-2-CSO
‘did you look first (before you act)?’The third person subject is zero marked in the declarative mood. In other
moods, other subject persons may be zero marked, such as the second person
singular in the imperative. Because I do not consider this as ellipsis, it is discussed in the concerned sections on mood. As regards example (3114), however, it is not quite clear whether we are dealing with ellipsis or zero crossreference. I have nevertheless treated it as zero marking in section (8.3.1.3.).
There may be originally a relation between ellipsis and compounding. In
verbal compounds, the first member does not bear inflexion:
(3115)darje=hyhy'rwa-ki
strong=move-DEC
‘it is walking fast’In section (6.2.4.1.) the omission of verbal inflexion was considered as one
of the ways to form adverbs. In the following example the verb root txu'hǊi- is
probably not compounded with the next verb root, but used as an independent
adverb:
(3116)txu'hǊi horo-'ra
little
cut.up-IMP
‘take a little bit of it!’Ellipsis of verbal inflexion was also encountered as a way to express coordination, as an alternative to cosubordinative marking. This will be described at
the end of section (8.5.).
7.5.2. Ellipsis of roots
The omission of verb roots is much more common than omission of verb inflexion. Because this makes utterances rather unspecific literally, their interpretation depends heavily on the speech context. Consequently, root ellipsis
occurs frequently in dialogues, as a minimal response to questions, remarks or7.5. Morphological ellipsis579comments. Several characteristic properties of Kwaza grammar may have
emerged originally from root ellipsis.
7.5.2.1. Elliptic responses

stress of elliptic responses usually falls on the first syllable):

above are neutralised, or only one of the meanings is selected, when the verb is

‘I have already drunk’Apart from the verbs which can occur with both declarative markers in the
zero-marked third person and apart from the many verbs of which there is no
information on which declaratives are required or allowed, there is a small
number of verb roots which may only take one of the declarative markers in the
third person. Again, these roots do not systematically share any formal and semantic characteristics which explain why they belong to the same set. The following set of verbs can only get the declarative morpheme -ki:
(1307)bay‘sour’
bu?Ǌ'kja- ‘lie’
bu?Ǌ'xe- ‘remain’
de'he‘bitter, strong’

-leja‘(2O.FUT)’
-nã‘(FUT)’
-tara‘(PROC)’
-tsy‘(POT)’There are probably many more members to these lists but we lack information
about the (im)possibility of either one of the declarative markers. Furthermore,
the information we have is not always clear. As an example, the verb rai'hͿ‘ruin, break down’ was mainly encountered with -tse. However, we cannot add
it to any of the lists above, since we lack conclusive evidence for the possibility
of ?rai'hͿki.177
5.2.1.3. Pragmatic characteristics of -tse vs. -ki
Aside from semantic factors, there may be a pragmatic condition on the occurrence of either of the declarative markers. Verbs are often in the -tse declarative
when the utterance is an answer to a question, or also when a state of affairs is
emphasised or described to someone who was not a witness or who was not
aware of it:
(1309)xare'nͿki

‘it is in front/turned towards us (A to Q)’(1310)la'to kuida'hͿki

(1883)oi'tsi-ki
copulate-DEC
‘(animal) is mating’oitsi-'lİ-ki
copulate-RECI-DEC
‘human is having sex’With the verb root wady- ‘to give’, the reciprocal morpheme suggests that
many people are involved in the action of giving, and this is not necessarily a
reciprocal action:
(1884)wady-'lİ-(wa)-ki
give-RECI-IS-DEC
‘they are giving (things) to one another/to a multitude’In the case of few people, reflexive -nͿ- would be inserted in addition to -lİ-,
and the action would be reciprocal:
(1885)wa-nͿ-dy-'lİ-ki
give-REF-CAU-RECI-DEC
‘they are giving (things) to one another’Note again that -nͿ- is inserted in a strange place, inside the root.
There are no reflexive or reciprocal pronouns in Kwaza. There is a lexeme
which has in a way a restricted comitative sense, ƭlİlİ ‘them together, themselves, just them’. On another occasion, the consultant explained that ƭlİlİ was
also used to refer to ‘a couple’, e.g. ‘two Westerners’, ‘two brothers’, ‘two Indians’, but also: ‘a group of only Germans’, etc. Formally it may consist of the
pronoun ƭ ‘he’, and a reciprocal morpheme -lİ- or the emphatic morpheme -le‘just, only’, or both. It is used as a contrastive answer to questions like: ‘John
comes with whom?’, answer: ƭlİlİ ‘no, he is coming only with his brother’; ‘is
he married to a Brazilian?’, answer: ƭlİlİ ‘no, he is together with her (the one
you know)’. The categorial status of ƭlİlİ is ambiguous. In the next example it
is used as a verb stem:

"8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses(3509)663tsicwa-'ta cu'cu-ki
begin-CSO step-DEC
‘he began to walk’So, from the viewpoint of morphological segmentability the element -cwa- is
treated as if it is a productive cross-reference marker. Because it is not, the exclusivity of -ta in a third person medial construction may be considered as a
morphophonological constraint with a highly limited domain.
We shall now return to the reason why -Ø-ta is less frequent than -tja to express third person subject in cosubordination. Probably, -Ø-ta can lead to ambiguity with a zero-marked second person. There is no such danger in the imperative because its subject is intrinsically a second person, while its medial
clauses usually even employ the overt cross-reference marker -xa-. But as explained in (8.3.1.3.), zero-marking of a second person does also occur in medial
clauses cosubordinated with interrogative matrix predicates. As long as a matrix predicate form is present, there is little doubt about the interpretation of the
zero-marked persons in medial clauses. However, when a matrix verb is absent
or at the end of an extended clause chain, there may be room for confusion.
Therefore -Ø-ta may be less frequently used for third person than -tja.
Another hypothesis about the nature of -tja is that it is (originally?) not a cosubordinative marker, but a manner-adverbial clause ending. This hypothesis is
discussed in section (8.2.4.).
8.3.1.5. Indefinite subject marking in medial clauses: -(c)wa
In cosubordinations with an indefinite subject, the indefinite subject marker
-wa- (see 5.1.4.1.) is applied to both the medial clause and the matrix clause:
(3510)dodotxi'tİ o'hui-wa-ta
'nãi-wa-ki
like-IS-DEC
ball
play-IS-CSO
‘they do that (because they) are playing ball’379There is a variant of -wa- which seems to have exactly the same semantic
value: -cwa-. The following examples demonstrate its use:
(3511)aky-'ta e'mã-cwa-ta
'mİ̘-eteja-wa-ki
two-ANI more-IS-CSO beat-1PO-IS-DEC
‘they were with three persons who beat us’379.This phrase could be uttered as an answer to questions of someone who is unacquainted with the game. If his questions are very stupid one could use a more expletive matrix clause 'nãi-wa-he'rejã're ‘they do that of course, you fool!’.","[700, 701]"
"866Dictionaryhyrwa- (V) escape from a corral, go
round
In the third person declarative only -tse
is used: *hyrwaki. a'rǊi hy:'rwa'tsi
‘take care, the horse may escape!’.
hytxa- (V) drop
bala'hͿ hy'txadyta ‘(e.g. the stone)
slipped out of the hand unintentionally’.
-hӻ (svn) NOM
-hͿ- is by far the most frequently
occurring morpheme of Kwaza, and it
has a variety of functions. It is
basically a semantically neutral
nominaliser. 'kuida'hͿ txu'hǊitse ‘I
drank little’ (lit. ‘me-drinking was
little’), exa'hͿ ‘that which you have’,
tã'jã tawa'hͿ ‘the one called / they call
chief’. Kwaza having neither adjectives nor relativisation, attributive
modification is realised often by
nominalised verb roots in juxtaposition
to nouns, and complex attributive
constructions can be the result: dutu're
Ǌ'kaityhata'hͿ a'wͿidahͿki ‘I saw that
that pig who lay down in your
hammock’; tau'ta i'sitsyhͿ a'wͿidahͿki, isi'?ǊkatsahͿ, tsiri'tsajãhͿ ‘I saw a
dead sloth, one who died on the path,
one in the middle of the path’. The
nominaliser can function as a semantically neutral classifier: a'xy arwa'hͿ
‘new house’ vs. a'xy haka'xy ‘old
house’. It is often verbalised recursively. This results in cleft-like
constructions which can occur with a
variety of subtle, and sometimes rather
marginal grammatical, semantic and
pragmatic effects such as valencychange,
past,
progressive
and
emphasis: holanDa'na 'ahͿki ‘it is

ucenãi'hehͿ'dyjadaki ‘I make them not
understand’; lotenã unã'tsudahͿ'ta (or
ere'ridahͿ'ta) ka'tsudaki ‘because I
have long legs I step over the fence’.
In combination with animate object
marker -wã it forms a fixed combination which expresses an agent noun:o'kjahͿwã ‘hunter’. It is lexicalised in
many roots, such as e'hͿ- ‘to make’.

"5887. Other morphosyntactic structuresthis phenomenon as “degrammaticalisation” also in (5.5.15.) and in van der
Voort (2002a).
Cliticisation of verbal inflexion to nouns was dealt with in (4.4.9.) as zeroverbalisation. Verbal inflexion of adverbs, just means that they also function as
semantically attributive verb roots. Nouns may sometimes also be used as adverbs. One special instance of verbalisation of such an adverb was discussed in
(6.2.4.1.), example (2699).
7.5.2.4. Abstract ellipsis
About elliptic responses as discussed in (7.5.2.1.), one could say that the specific root is physically absent but that it is understood, and identifiable from the
context. About quoted speech as discussed in (7.5.2.3.) one could maintain that
a verb root of speech was deleted. However, most quoted speech constructions
would be ungrammatical without such deletion, because it would result in juxtaposition of matrix clause predicates. Finally, it seems that the resumptive use
of inflexions as discussed in (7.5.2.2.) does not involve easily identifiable
omitted verb roots at all. In the present subsection I will discuss some root
omissions which may be even more abstract.
In section (8.2.2.3.) concessive adverbial clause constructions involving the
subordinator =wara ‘but’ are discussed. This element is always preceded by a
nominaliser, usually -hͿ. The nominaliser is normally preceded by the verbal
root of the adverbial clause predicate. However, the morphological complex
-hͿ=wara can also occur independently, as a concessive conjunctional particle,
forming a link between sentences or sections of the discourse. Although this is
also amply illustrated in (8.2.2.3.) I will give an example of it here:
(3151)oja-e'te-da-tsy-tse
go-COMIT-1S-POT-DECzezƭju-dy-'rjͿ
hͿ=wara
Zezinho-POS-DC:area NOM=buthe'?ai -da-ki
want.not-1S-DEC
‘we are going together to Zezinho, but I don’t want to, no’
The same abstract kind of ellipsis was observed in quoted speech constructions, when the verbal root of the quoted phrase was omitted. Compare the
following examples from (8.1.2.2.):
(3152)la'to
'masiju kukuihͿ-da-'ki-tsy-hͿ-ki
yesterday Marcio ill-1S-DEC-GER-NOM-DEC
‘yesterday, Marcio said he is ill’7.5. Morphological ellipsis(3153)589tsy-'hͿ-kiGER-NOM-DEC‘he says yes / he says so’
Example (3153) can be used as if tsy- were a verb root meaning ‘to say’ or a
third person singular cross-reference morpheme. It may be an elliptic version of
(3311), but it may apparently also function as a response to questions like ‘was
Marcio ill yesterday?’:
(3154)la'to
tsicwata
'masiju kukui'hͿ-hͿ-re
yesterday begin-CSO Marcio ill-NOM-INT
‘did Marcio become ill yesterday?’(3155)tsy-'hͿ-ki
GER-NOM-DEC
‘he says so / it is said’344
The same situation exists with respect to the following examples:
(3156)tsy-'nãixwa-wa-kiGER-SIMU-IS-DEC‘they pretend to be talking’(3157)'tse-cwa-kiDEC-IS-DEC‘it is said (that...)’Speech quotations can be extended also with further morphology, e.g. the frustrative morpheme -le- (see 8.2.2.2.). Compare the following examples:
(3158)haru'wi 'ja-a-tsy-'tse-tsy-'le-hͿ-ki
Luiz
eat-1P-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
‘Luiz invited us for dinner, now what to do?’ (it isn’t possible)(3159)tsy-'le-hͿ-ki
GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
‘he said that; however, unfortunately I can’t’, ‘what a pity’Example (3159) is the elliptic version of (3158), but it can also be uttered for
example as an elliptic response to someone saying ‘Luiz invited us to eat!’, as
if it were a lamentative predicate itself.
Also other morphemes, such as repetitive -je?e- ‘again’ and negative -hefollowed by person and mood marking can occur elliptically, without there being a specific verb root which is understood:
(3160)je'?e-wa-si
again-IS-SWR
‘they explained again’, ‘they did it again’ (etc.)344.Although the consultant added that hͿ'?Ϳ ‘yes’ would have been a better answer.","[625, 626, 627]"
"742. The sounds of KwazaLong consonants exist phonetically: [tsutÓ'm:İ] ‘brains, cerebrum’, ['nnİ+ki]
~ ['nn:İ+ki] ‘come, arrive’, [kan’:wҊã] ‘canoe, boat’, [Èut:u'4e] ‘pig’, [sile't:a]
‘afternoon’.
2.10. Intonation
Intonation contours may have an illocutionary function in Kwaza. Actually
verbal moods such as declarative, interrogative, imperative etc. require a formal expression and are often accompanied by a specific intonation. From a
formal point of view, verbs without morphological person and mood marking
are incomplete. In the proper context, however, such marking can be omitted. It
appears that in such cases, the accompanying intonation pattern becomes more
prominent as if to make up for the omitted morphemes.
In the interrogative mood, tone rises at the end of the utterance, and more
distinctly so, in the case of ellipsis of person and interrogative markers (and it
sometimes also influences the placement of stress). It is symbolised here by an
upw ard arrow <n> preceding the syllable with rising pitch:
['wa!a'sasa'4e]
['wa!a'nsa]‘have you finished?’
‘have you finished?’[ku'kuKnãƭ!enÓ'4jasa4e]
[ku'kuKnãƭ!enÓ'n4ja]‘did you suffer pain?’
‘you suffered pain?’['sÓKÈÓ'4jѸÓ'4e]
['sÓKÈÓ'n4jѸÓ]‘is it your place?’
‘your place?’[ha'tsi!Ǌ]
[ha'tsi!Ǌ'4e]
[hatsi'n!Ǌ]‘heliconia flower’
‘is it a heliconia flower?’
‘(you mean/is it) heliconia flower?’[ha'hanÓmãƭ'nãdaki]
[ha'hanÓmãƭ'nnã]‘I’m going to brush my teeth’
‘are you going to brush your teeth?’When information is provided without the use of the declarative morpheme,
intonation (and stress placement) differs from the ordinary. The following pronunciation of the word [ln'nİ] ‘hole’ was heard as an answer to the question
'what do you call the hole (i.e. mouth) of the basket?’:
['lnnİ]‘just “hole”’As we saw in section (2.8.) above, the negative morpheme /-he-/ usually
gets main stress. In short context-dependent replies it also gets a high tone.","[111, 112]"
"2184. The noun phrase20 a'kykoje a'kykoje 'bwaki
20 aky'hͿ e'mã ele'le‘two hands two hands ended’
‘two and more many’ (4)The basic structures of these complex numerals can be divided into two types:
juxtaposition and cosubordination. The expression for ‘three’ is a juxtapositive
construction:
(889) aky-'hͿ
e'mã
two-NOM more
‘three’ (lit. ‘two and one more’)
It is excluded that (889) represents a modification construction, because otherwise it would have meant ‘six’ or ‘two more’. In addition to modification, the
secondary function of juxtaposition is coordination. Therefore, I analyse the
structure of such complex numerals as coordinate. This construction is discussed further in section (8.5.). Another construction through which complex
numerals are expressed is cosubordination:
(890) bwa-ko'je-tja
aky-'hͿ-tse
end-CL:hand-CSO two-NOM-DEC
‘seven’ (lit. ‘a hand ending it is two (fingers)’)
(891) bwa-ko'je-tja
aky-ko'je-tse
end-CL:hand-CSO two-CL:hand-DEC
‘fifteen’ (lit. ‘a hand ending it is two hands’)
In these examples both numerals are zero-verbalised, and then placed in a medial clause structure. The cosubordination construction is discussed in
(8.3.1.10.) and (8.5.).
Note that the root aky- ‘two’ may have a paucal connotation.134 Consider the
following question and compare the alternative answers:
(892) Q:hi dodo'ja-xa-re
fire cut-2-INT
‘did you cut firewood?’Aa:hi
co-'hͿ dodo'ja-da-ki
fire many-NOM cut-1S-DEC
‘I cut much firewood’Ab:aky-'hͿ
dodo'ja-da-ki
two-NOM cut-1S-DEC
‘I cut a little (firewood)’The root aky- ‘two’ is lexicalised with the (reflexive?) element -nͿ- in the
noun aky'nͿ ‘friend’.
134.There are languages in which the word for ‘pair’ may also mean ‘several’, such as
Dutch, where the standard interpretation of paar is ‘several’.","[255, 256]"
"5.2. Mood293The pragmatic contrast between -ki and -tse as observed in example (1310)
may help to explain why -tse cannot be immediately attached to an overt person marker. If -tse brands the verb as explicitly conveying new and actual information, an utterance like *kui-da-tse *’I (am) drink(ing)’ is irrelevant because the hearer is naturally bound to be a (potential) witness of the expressed
fact.
Note, however, the following dialogue, which suggests that the rule-ofthumb “answer to a question” is not to be regarded as an absolute criterion for
the occurrence of -tse:
(1312)R:a'le hedydu'tu-tse
axe lose-DEC
‘he lost the axe’Q:tsǊhǊ-ra'ti hedydu'tu-re
what-FOC lose-INT
‘what did he lose?’A:a'le hedydu'tu-ki
axe lose-DEC
‘he lost the axe’Also, other explanations for the difference between the alternatives in (1310)
were offered on another occasion, and are repeated above in (1295).
5.2.1.4. -tse vs. -ki in verbalisation of nouns
Whatever the semantic and pragmatic reasons to use one or the other declarative marker, they are all subjected to the formal morphological condition that it
is impossible for an overt person to be followed immediately by -tse. There
seems to be no clear general reason why this should be the case, but there is
one phenomenon that could shed some more light on this problem. Kwaza
nouns can be derived as verbs without further morphological operations.178
Both -ki and -tse can be used. Nouns derived by -ki have an identificational
function, whereas nouns derived by -tse rather seem to have an existential
function:
(1313)e'tay-ki
woman-DEC
‘it is a woman’Ione e'tay-ki
Ione woman-DEC
‘Ione is a woman’(1314)e'tay
'a-ki
(1315)
woman exist-DEC
‘there is a woman/are women’auxwa'na jo-'le-tse
meat
manioc-only-DEC
‘there is only meat and manioc’178.The phenomenon of zero-verbalisation, both in declarative and other moods, is discussed as a separate subject in (4.4.9.).","[330, 331]"
"Kinship terminologyIn fieldwork interviews about kinship terminology it is necessary not to become too abstract. In general, people get confused after several questions like
“and how do you call the son of your sister-in-law?”, and they will start to give
terms that only match for part of the question, or invert the question and give
the term which is used by the kinsperson for ego, or give wrong terms altogether. In the ideal situation, one should be specific and ask terms for existing
persons, e.g. “how do you call Almir?”, which obviously requires that you
know as many family members as possible by name and in what way they are
related to the consultant (‘ego’). However, the original full Kwaza kinship
system is not matched for all of its members by living representants at this
moment.
In present-day Kwaza society, not all attested kinship terms can be used any
more. It is no longer realistic to speak of a Kwaza “society”, or even a “community”. The Kwaza were reduced considerably during the decades following
first contact with the Westerners and have been living in pluri-ethnic communities with Kanoê, Salamãi, Aikanã and Tuparí since the ensuing introduction

stem is omitted:
[ÈÓ'nwa]
[""nheÈanÓ hakn'4e ÈÓ'wa]‘have you finished cutting (rice)?’
‘not yet, tomorrow we will finish to cut’Maybe because of their semantic content, some words always get high pitch
and heavy stress on the first syllable:
[""ntsi!a4jѸÓki]‘it is (completely) silent’2.11. Exceptional sounds
It is a known fact that ideophones often contain sounds which may in principle
be considered as phonemes but which otherwise do not occur in the language’s
ordinary vocabulary. The same goes for specific sounds in loanwords, and may
hold for specific registers too.
/ng/ [0] is encountered in the ideophone [tu'pǊ0] ‘splash!’. It is probably a (velar) continuation of the nasal feature of the preceding [Ǌ].
/ü/ [y] is encountered in the ideophone [hy:'4yp]. This ideophone symbolises
the chant of the iriwa bird species. Note that /ü/ is also a loan phoneme from
Aikanã, and that a similar ideophone is probably the basis of the name for the
iriwa bird in Aikanã: hü'rüdü'dü.
2.12. Loan phonology and phonetics
Kwaza has a number of loanwords from Portuguese which denote introduced
concepts and names. Furthermore, many words for animals, and names of persons and places originate from neighbouring indigenous languages (see also
van der Voort fcb). These words often contain sounds which are absent in native Kwaza phonology and lexicon. As loan words are used in daily speech by
everyone, they can be said to have introduced a number of loan phonemes in
Kwaza. They are listed below.
/ü/ [y] is a loan phoneme that originates from Aikanã. It is encountered in (e.g.)
personal names, as [Èa'Èy] (AIK Èa'Èü).
/B/ [b] is a loan phoneme. In loanwords from Portuguese, plosive [b]’s cannot
be replaced by implosives: [bisi'kleta] (POR bici'cleta) ‘bicycle’, ['k4eba] (POR
Gleba) ‘(placename)’, [ba'lade'4a] (POR bala'deira) ‘catapult’.","[112, 113]"

7.2.7. Expletive -rai- ‘damned!’

it can be used in a neutral way, it has usually a heavily expletive connotation.
However, this often occurs in an ironic context of faking indignation. The mor5487. Other morphosyntactic structurespheme is mostly applied to verb stems, between the person cross-reference and

‘it doesn’t hurt, no!’ (speaker does not want to admit he has pain)The expletive morpheme sometimes replaces the mood marker, as in the second alternative answer to (2920), and it does not have to be very impolite. The
following examples represent possible answers to a compliment by someone
about the tasteful soup the speaker has made:

‘it does not taste good’(2928)'wai-he-'rai
good-NEG-damn
‘it does not taste good’In fact, (2928) was considered as more polite than the countersuppositional example (2927).

which -rai replaces a mood marker, and in which the root wai- occurs in the
cosubordinative mood:

In the example (2865), -rai is attached to a noun. In the next example, the
derived noun is zero-verbalised:
(2931)'ñǊ-rai-re
faeces-damn-INT
‘it isn’t dung, pal!’ (hearer was afraid to taste liquorice)5507. Other morphosyntactic structuresSection (7.2.1.) contains several examples in which -rai is combined with
the paucal morpheme -ry- in the following manner:
(2932)kuraku'ra-ry-'rai
chicken-PAU-damn
‘those/my/your/his chicken’In this combination, -rai does not seem to have a strong expletive connotation.
However, it does seem that there can be a context dependent possessive connotation. That possessive relation can be made explicit, as in the next example:
(2933)'xyi-dy-hͿ
tala-ry-'rai
you-POS-NOM uncle-PAU-damn
‘your uncles’The morpheme -rai may be etymologically related to the verb root rai'hͿ‘to ruin’, and/or to the root of nouns such as 'rai?ͿhͿ ‘animal, thing’, 'rai?ͿnǊ
‘poison’.
7.2.8. Focus -ratiWhen applied to nouns or verb roots, the morpheme -rati- has a focus function.
It occurs often in interrogative clauses, attached to the question word tsǊhǊ
‘what’.

(2940)tsǊhǊ-ra'ti-re
what-FOC-INT
‘what kind of thing is it?’ (reaction to someone’s question about ‘it’)-rati- is not an interrogative morpheme, and it is possible to ask the same questions without its application. However, it accentuates a certain topic which is,
explicitly or implicitly, at hand. Of the following set of alternatives, to be possibly uttered when one sees tracks in the sand, the consultant said that the one
without -rati- was ‘less clear’:
(2941)tsǊhǊ-rati-to'ha-re
(2942)
what-FOC-foot-INT
‘it is the tracks of what?’tsǊhǊ-to'ha-re
what-foot-INT
‘what track is it?’ (MA: ‘less clear’)-rati can also be applied to verb roots:
(2943)wai-rati-'re

‘is it delicious?’(2944)ti-'nãi

‘how is it we call it?, anini (tree species) they say, they light the fire
with that round stuff’
The clause in which -rati- occurs does not necessarily have an interrogative
value. In the following examples, -rati- replaces the mood marker and indicates
surprise and emphasis:
(2945)mo'rango wai-ra'ti-ta'dy

contains historical narrative. This is discussed in the next subsection. It furthermore shows some resemblance to the nominal prioritive morpheme -ratadiscussed in (4.4.7.). Note that -rati- is homophonous with, but considered distinct from, a classifier that means ‘man’ discussed in (4.2.2.2.).
7.2.9. Historical narrative use of -ratiIn historical narrative the morpheme -rati- is usually applied to the matrix
predicate in a position between person cross-reference and mood marking (note
that this is also the case in example (2944) above). It signals the fact that
something used to occur in olden times. Often, this concerns traditional customs which do not exist any more. In the following examples, -rati- is applied
because, according to the consultant, the custom or the people concerned ‘don’t
exist any more now’:
(2948)axy'hi 'ƭ-wa-rati-ki

the past or that a custom was interrupted, but it is not obligatory for historical
narrative:319.Referring to the story about the origin of the rainbow.","[584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590]"

Here the omitted root is unidentifiable. The inflexions occur as abstract conjunctional particles whose only function is to indicate that the next clause has a
different subject.339 From the point of view of the cosubordinate marker, however, these elliptic elements can be seen as resumptive. The cosubordinate
marker reminds the hearer of the fact that everything which precedes is part of
the same medial clause chain, regardless of whether any matrix moods have already passed by. The real end of this clause chain is only the final matrix clause
of the entire story. Even when the story is interrupted by a listener posing a
question, it can be resumed by a resumptive particle:

‘yes, then they, when night falls ...’ (t)So the elements which I have called “resumptive” here, both have a prospective
property, which is expressed in the person marker, and a resumptive property,
which is expressed in the cosubordination marker.
Note that veritable omission of a root can have a truly resumptive effect:

"281. IntroductionThe examples are as much as possible in a phonemic spelling, but phonetic
variation is sometimes indicated. I found this necessary since not all questions
that concern the underlying phonological structures of Kwaza may have been
answered satisfactorily yet.34 Word boundary is symbolised by a space < > and
morpheme boundary by a hyphen <->, or, in the case of compounds (and
sometimes cliticisation), by the equation sign <=>. A dot <.> occurs between
multiple component elements of an English gloss corresponding to a single
morpheme in Kwaza. The presence of a glottal stop <?> is not indicated in
automatic positions, provided that these positions are preceded by a space, hyphen or equation sign (see the discussion concerning the glottal stop in 2.2.2.).
The main stress of polysyllabic words is usually symbolised by an apostrophe <'> preceding the stressed syllable (see 2.8.).35 In chapter (2.) stress is only
indicated in the phonetic transcriptions, since it is not analysed as phonemic.
However, because the proposed rules of stress placement are sometimes not
consistent with stress placement in actual spontaneous data, main stress as observed is always indicated in the rest of the work, even though the notation of
the glossed examples is largely phonemic. When a word contains two stress
markers it has not been possible to determine which one of them was main and
which one was secondary. Very long derived or compounded words may contain several main stress positions. The precise determination of the rules with
regard to stress is a matter of future research.
The free translations of the examples are based as directly as possible on the
Portuguese translations given of the Kwaza phrases by the consultants themselves. Because the notion “sentence” in Kwaza has not been thoroughly explored I have avoided the use of capitals and full stops in both the Kwaza material and the free translations. The main exceptions to this concern proper names
and quoted utterances in the free translations.
1.12. Previous documentation of Kwaza
For the project that resulted in the present description of the Kwaza language,
the first data were gathered and analysed in the beginning of 1995. Until that
time, no knowledge existed about its grammar, except with its own few speakers, however not in written form. The only knowledge that existed about the
language at all, outside of its speakers’ community, and in written form, was
lexical. Early explorers and scientists of the previous unmapped territory that is
now called the state of Rondônia took down words from the indigenous languages they encountered.","[65, 66]"
"2785. The verb phrase5.1.6. Non-personal use of first person plural -aBesides indefinite and impersonal reference, there is also a morpheme that has
a non-personal sense, which is homophonous with the first person plural inclusive subject morpheme -a-. Consequently, I consider it to be the same suffix.
The first person plural morpheme very rarely occurs with a non-personal
interpretation in verbs. The following example possibly represents one of these
instances, as it seems that -a- does not function as a first person plural marker
there. The sentence was uttered while pointing at the lungs of a slaughtered pig:
(1229)ͿhͿ'ko enã'jã-a-ki
here
breathe-1P-DEC
‘here you/we breathe/one breathes’169In the non-personal reading, an existential translation would be: ‘here there is
breathing’.
In its non-personal function -a- usually precedes nominalisers, and it is applied to create infinitive-like abstract nouns. As the evidence for the nonpersonal function of -a- is much more convincing in the context of nominalisation, it is further discussed in section (5.6.3.).
5.1.7. Impersonal use of the verb root jã- ‘to be’
The verb root jã- ‘to be’ is mostly used in special idiomatic and emphatic cleft
constructions (see 7.2.11. and 8.6.3.) such as the one below:
(1230)jere'xwa tͅjãwã-'wy hyhy'rwa-ta dutu're
jaguar dark-time move-CSO pigtxe-'hͿ
grab-NOMkahİ-'hͿ
bite-NOMka'hİ-ta jo='bwa-tsy-hͿ
ha'dytİ=hyhyrwa-'hͿ-ki=jã-hͿ
bite-CSO devour=end-GER-NOM shit=move-NOM-DEC=be-NOM
‘the jaguar walks in the dark, grabs wild pigs, bites and eats them,
and walks while he shits, it is like that’ (t)
In some of these constructions, jã- occurs in a position where one would expect
a person cross-reference marker. Note how the following examples, which represent a possible answer to the question ‘what is this pipe for?’, were claimed
to be identical in meaning:169.According to the offered POR translation: aquí a gente respira.","[315, 316]"
"5.2. Mood2975.2.2. Interrogative
The interrogative mood marker -re (sometimes also pronounced as [4İ]) is attached to the very same person markers as the declarative. The third person
singular remains the zero-marked form.
(1330)tsu'hǊ pİ̘rİ̘'jã-xa-re
what
speak-2-INT
‘what are you saying?’(1331)di'lİ 'cu-re
who cut-INT
‘who is cutting (felling the tree)?’Certain forms are obviously difficult to elicit in the field. As mentioned above
in (5.2.1.), the declarative of the second person normally elicits imperative or
interrogative forms. Similarly, the imperative and interrogative combined with
an adjacent first person marker are best elicited in offered contexts that are considered absurd or ironic, etc.

kui-da-'re
(1333)
water drink-1S-INT
‘am I (going to) drinking water?’hyhyrwa-'hͿ-a-re
move-NOM-1P-INT
‘is it we who are walking?’180In future tenses, the first person interrogative is less extraordinary. The following example was elicited in the context of a group discussion addressing the
question of who is going to be sent on an unpleasant mission:
(1334)o'ja-da-tsy-'re
(better than o'jada're)
leave-1S-POT-INT
‘am I going (to leave)?’Also in certain past constructions the first person interrogative may occur:
(1335)ti-'rjͿ
a'sa-da-re
what-CD:area leave-1S-INT
‘where did I put it?’When person and interrogative mood inflexion of a question are omitted,
there is a notable rise of intonation on the last syllable of the interrogative verb:
(1336)tyka'?o
visit
‘(are you) promenading/strolling?’180.The sentence created by myself which contained a first person exclusive form
*hyhyrwa-'nã-axa-re *’are we going for a walk or what?’ was rejected by MA who
explained it was “contrariant”.","[334, 335]"
"161. Introductionworkers is that the linguistic data should be processed right away in the field.
This was hardly possible in my case because of the attention we got from the
many children and the way we were involved in community life.
The different sessions in the field consisted of formal elicitation of word
lists and minimal pairs. These were recorded on tape for phonological documentation and analysis. Furthermore, I asked for translations into Kwaza of series of Portuguese sentences which I had based on Comrie and Smith’s (1977)
and Dahl’s (1985) questionnaires, and on the three volumes edited by Shopen
(1985). Already in the first weeks in the field some texts in Kwaza were recorded and transcribed and an attempt was made to gloss the texts with the help
of the consultant. Later, as Mario became more accustomed to my questions
and as my understanding of the language advanced, morpheme-by-morpheme
translation became less laborious and the analyses became more dependable.
Part II of the present work contains a number of glossed and translated texts, of
several different types. Outside of the fieldwork sessions, I learnt much about
the language by accompanying Mario and others on hunting and fishing trips
and work in the forest. Such occasions were ideal for collecting specific terminology relating to the local flora and fauna, both in Kwaza and in Aikanã.
Many hours of linguistic sessions were devoted to verification and correction
of the data from previous sessions. Besides linguistic interviews with speakers
of Kwaza, I spoke with elderly people whenever I had a chance. Not only is the
Kwaza language undocumented and endangered, but also the traditional culture
and history of the entire region.30
My teacher Mario belongs to family I. As depicted above in (1.6.), the ecology of the Kwaza language in family I has been adversely affected by the low
number of speakers as far as the domain of its use is concerned. Furthermore,
there are some differences between the language as spoken in family I and in
family II. It may be that some differences have a dialectal basis, but on several
occasions there were also indications for a difference in linguistic knowledge.
This became apparent in the knowledge of specialised vocabulary such as kinship terminology.31 On several occasions, members of the different families
said that the other family speaks “different”. Mario once said that family II
members speak in an “old-fashioned” way. Sometimes, members of family II
even claimed to speak “better” themselves. This was not confirmed by the
members of family I, but with questions regarding specific lexical items, Mario
sometimes referred me to Antonhão, the oldest member of family II. He also
told me that he himself had learnt words and expressions from Antonhão which
his mother Maria Edite did not know. Circumstances like these might constitute
a ground to prefer consultants from family II over those from family I. However, I did not, for several reasons: the first reason being that I had no choice.
In order to conduct fieldwork of reasonable quality I would probably have had
to move and live with family II, which was impossible if I also wanted to
30. What the old people have to tell requires more research and merits a separate study.
31. This situation is discussed further in section (9.4.).","[53, 54]"

The possessive morpheme -dy- is homophonous with the benefactive morpheme -dy-, but it has a different distribution and behaviour. It forms a root that
neither exists independently as a nominal stem, nor can it form a verb stem like
the benefactive does:

I-POS-NOM
‘mine’/
/*si-dy
I-POS/
/*(kopu) si-dy-ki
(cup) I-POS-DECWe have seen in examples (661) and (662) that concomitants of the possessive
construction can be verbalised through e.g. the declarative marker -ki:
(674) 'si-dy-hͿ
kanwa=ekai-'e
I-POS-NOM canoe=leg-too
‘my car’(675) si-dy-'hͿ-ki
kanwa=ekai-'e
I-POS-NOM-DEC canoe=leg-too
‘it is my car/the car is mine’During elicitation sessions in fieldwork doubt was expressed by MA at the
grammaticality of the non-verbalised possessor as an answer two an open
question, like to: ‘whose car is that?’, A: *?'marjudyhͿ ‘Mario’s’ instead of
marjudy'hͿki ‘it is Mario’s’.
Other verbal moods than the declarative are also possible. Note that in some
of the following interrogative examples, word order is reversed apparently
without semantic consequences:
(676) e'tay 'xyi-dy-hͿ-re
wife I-POS-NOM-INT
‘is she your wife?’(677) 'xyi-dy-hͿ-re e'tay
I-POS-NOM-INT wife

I-POS-NOM wife-INT
‘is she your wife?’
Here are some further examples:

‘whose cup is it?’(680) A: 'si-dy-ro-ki
I-POS-CL:cup-DEC

‘whose is it?’(682) di'lİ-dy-xy-re
who-POS-CL:house-INT
‘whose house is it?’Note that not with all pronouns the possessive morpheme -dy- is possible, that
is, not with the pronoun txana ‘we.IN’:
(683) txana(*-dy)-'hͿ-ki
'kopo
we.IN(-POS)-NOM-DEC cup
‘it is our cup/the cup is ours’(684) 'kopo txana-'ro-ki

‘it is our cup/the cup is ours’114(685) İ-'ja
txana-'rjͿ
go-EXP we.IN-CD:area
‘let’s go to our place!’
An explanation for the behaviour of txana is that it is of Tupi-Guarani origin,
unlike the other pronouns. All other pronouns require -dy-, although TE rejected also the combination of the possessive morpheme with xyitsİ ‘you.PL’:115
(686) tsyitsİ(*-dy)-'hͿ-ki 'kopo
you.PL(-POS)-NOM-DEC cup
‘it is your cup’
In headless possessive constructions which contain a classifier and which
refer to animal body parts, the possessive morpheme -dy- is often, but not always, optional. The resulting construction is one of noun classification as described in (4.2.1.9.):114.Once I ventured *kopo txana-dy-ro-ki ‘our cup’ wherupon MA said in Portuguese:
'ta certo, mas não existe ‘It’s correct, but it doesn’t exist’.
115.This is probably caused by uncertainty on the part of TE. Notice in this respect that
TE also pronounced the second person plural pronoun differently from normal xyi'tsİ: [tsÓitsİ] probably in analogy with tsitsİ ‘we.EX’.","[220, 221, 222]"

‘eyelashes’The element -xe, which is encountered in several forms, may be a variant of the
present classifier. The stem of what may be a verb huxe-hͿ-ki ‘it is hairy’ cannot occur without a classifier: *huxe-ki. Furthermore, there are nominal variants of this stem, including huxe-koro ‘arm hair’ and huxe-'to ‘male pubic hair’.
However, it is conspicuous that -xe is attached (and apparently lexicalised) on
the nominal empty root in: İxe'to ‘female pubic hair’. One could then argue that
the combination -xe-'to means ‘pubic hair’. The element -to is likely to represent the classifier -to ‘seed, sex organ’. An answer to the remaining question of
the origin of the element hu- can perhaps be procured from the verb hu-ki ‘it
sprouts’. Another meaning of hu-ki is ‘he/she/it smokes’. Note in this respect,
then, that exyi'lu means ‘fog’ (it is unclear what -lu means here), and that there
also exist more descriptive words for it, like hanãwã-'nǊ ‘fog’ (lit. ‘heavenpowder’) of which -nǊ is a classifier which is also associated with ‘hair’, as we
saw above in (502). So probably huxeto ‘male pubic hair’ has originally meant
‘hair-growth in the groin’.
xyilo ‘pipe, tube’; free lexical form: exyi'lo ‘pipe, reed, camera lens’. Refers to
protruding things like a little pipe, bird’s beak, lens of the camera.","[203, 204]"
"Parts of speechTrying to decide upon the question of what should be regarded as a “word” in
Kwaza, I have in the present work used a combination of phonological and
grammatical criteria. If an element may contain a stressed syllable and can occur in different positions in an utterance, I regard it as a word.
In general, main word stress tends to fall on the last syllable of the root. A
number of roots appear to coincide with monomorphemic stems which can occur as syntactically free elements in the clause. Another group of roots require
attachment of other elements before they can be syntactically free.
As it happens, this division between different kinds of roots can provide the
basis for a distinction between parts of speech in Kwaza. The coincidence of
certain formal and functional properties of free elements in Kwaza justifies a
major distinction of the grammatical categories of nouns, adverbs and particles
as opposed to verbs.",[129]

5.5.14.3. Appellative -herejãIn a compound structure with the verb root jã- ‘to be’ (see 7.2.11.), and without
a “conjectural” subject, -here- has an appellative and possibly even expletive
function. In the present work I treat -herejã- as one morpheme:
(2156)di'lİ di'lİ mãrİ̘ri'tsa 'bu=Ǌ-rjͿ-herejã-ki
who who person
put=be-CD:area-APPL-DEC
‘who (the hell) is that person sitting there?’ (t)The morpheme can be followed by an interrogative mood marker with the same
emphatic effect (see also 5.2.2.1.):

mother-APPL-INT
‘it is mother, didn’t you notice (you fool)!’Nasalisation does not spread in -herejã-. Even though the Western ear easily
hears [he'4ӁjѸã], such a pronunciation is immediately rejected. Only if one
makes the effort to say [he'rejã] is it accepted by the speakers of Kwaza.
In procedural texts, such as about how to make chicha, -herejã- occurs frequently and functions as an evidential tag question with the meaning ‘isn’t it?’:

own.
The resignation morpheme -tsy may also have an indignated connotation.
Note the contrast between the following quotative examples:
(2189)kukui'hͿ-da-'ki-da-ki
ill-1S-DEC-1S-DEC
‘I’m saying that I am ill’(2190)kukui'hͿ-da-'ki-da-hͿ-'tsy
ill-1S-DEC-1S-NOM-RES
‘didn’t I tell you that I’m ill?!’The first sentence represents a straightforward quotative utterance. For the second sentence a context is needed in which for example someone has come to
invite the speaker to go out hunting. Consequently, the implication of (2190) is
that the invitation is declined.
It may be that -tsy is not always immediately preceded by a nominaliser. In
the contrast between the following examples, it appears to replace a nominaliser (note that the attributive morpheme -Ϳ- does not occur word-finally):
(2191)'xyi-dy-rjͿ-ki
koreja'ro

koreja'ro
you-POS-CD:area-ATT-RES pan
‘the pan (which is) with you’(*xyidy'rjͿ korejaro)These latter two examples represent attributive constructions. This suggests
that words ending in -tsy are actually nouns. Maybe then, -tsy creates a sort of
cleft construction.

bu?Ǌce- (V) leave, put
Contains directional -ce- ‘aside’. Without the verb root bu- ‘put’ the meaning
becomes more specific: Ǌce- ‘put a
trap’. 'bu?Ǌcedaki ‘I left, put (it on the
ground, in a place, etc.)’. 'bu?Ǌce'dwaki ‘he put a thing on top’.
'bu?Ǌcetaki ‘he put (the wood) aside
(i.e. he made a pen to keep the donkey
from going away’.
bǊǊng (IDEO) bang! (heavy sound)
Unclear if ideophone in Kwaza:
buje'hͿki
‘shotgun

going
“[bǊ:ng:]!”‘.
bwa- (V) finish
In the third person declarative either
-tse or -ki is used. Note GUA -pa
‘finish’. 'bwatsyre ‘is it finished?’.
hako'ri 'bwaki ‘moon is waning’. It
does not just mean ‘to stop’: 'bwa?a'ni
‘let’s cease to exist’, hã'rã?a'ni ‘we
are going to stop, finish (doing
something)’. txahͿ 'bwatsͿrjͿ 'Ǌidaki ‘I
paused at the end of the road’. Often
compounded as completive / terminative aspect marker with another
V-stem: kave kui'bwa?a'sadaki ‘I
finished the coffee’, and, 'boidy'bwady'ra ‘fill it for him’, txa'rwa
'tsje'hebwaki ‘does not grab any more’,
anǊ'bwadaki ‘I planted all’, Q: dy'bwa
‘have you finished cutting (rice)?’, A:
'hedanͿ hako'redy'bwa ‘not yet,
tomorrow we will finish’. Often found
in composition with asa- ‘terminate’:
bwa?asa- ‘finish off’, with Q intonation: 'bwa?a'sa ‘have you finished?’.
Also used as a particle bwa ‘the end’,
‘that’s all’, ‘five’.
bwakoje (NUM) five
Lit. ‘end of hand’. bwako'jetse ‘the
fifth’. bwako'jebwako'je ‘ten’.
bwİ- (V) throw
bwİdaki ‘I threw (stone, stick etc.)’.
bwİ'lİ?axaki ‘we threw stones at each
other’.
bwİnİ- (V) return, arrive, come
PLS. bwİ'nİki ‘they arrived, returned’,
*bwİ'nİdaki. MA considers this word835as old-fashioned. He says he does not
like such words because they make
translation difficult. This word is used
by ZE and AN of fam II, and MA
learnt it from ME of fam I.
bwİ'nİ?a'xale'hͿ / o'nİ?a'xale'hͿ ‘we
were coming, returning’.d
-da- (svv) 1S
I: verbal first person singular subject
morpheme: ãi İ'nãdaki ‘I will go far’.
Applied to a bare noun, the personmood marker creates the sense of ‘to
be’ or ‘to want to have’, e.g. in:
atxi'txidaki, hari?i'xudaki, wanͿ'dydaki
and a'xydaki ‘I want / need maize,
beans, food, a house’. Applied to an
adverb in: hãtsǊ'wydaki ‘while he is
skinning, I’m (going to take advantage,
e.g. kill him)’. -da- can be used
together with a verbal mood suffix
independently in the appropriate
context such as an answer to yes/no
questions: Q: o'jaxatsyre ‘you’re
going?’, A: 'datsytsİ ‘I am’, da-'ki ‘yes
I am’ (lit. ‘1S-DEC’). Other elliptic
uses: data're ‘yes (intending: ‘no’)’
(lit. ‘is it that I am?’), data'ratsİ ‘I will
(do it) later’ / ‘later I maybe will’, lit.
‘1S-later-DEC’, da'tsytehe're ‘maybe
or maybe not’. In rare instances, the
mood marker was omitted, note SU:

dadahӻ- (V) startle
dada'hͿdaki ‘I was startled’. kurakura(wã) dadady'hͿdaki ‘I scared the

dai- (V) take, grab
Goes with inanimate object (as
opposed to hou-). ay'hͿ dai'ra ‘take
thát one’. dai'rowaki ‘they took
(countable tactile objects) from the
jar’. Reduplication of the root may
yield a progressive sense: 'daiki ‘he
took’, da'daidaki ‘I am/was taking
(away things)’, or it may indicate a
plural argument: da(i)'daiwaki 'manga
‘(two) people took mangoes’.
dai- (V-etym) divide, tear, separate
Requires nominaliser -hͿ- or a specific
classifier: dai'nǊ?ani ‘let’s divide
(sugar among us)’, dai'mǊ?a'ni ‘let’s
divide (liquor among us)’. Probably
related to dai- ‘take, grab’, and may
therefore be somewhat ambiguous
with specific classifiers: dai'xydaki ‘I
took a part from the book, I perforated
the book’. See also widai- ‘to cut
latex’.
dai- (V-etym) rise, fly
Etymological stem used only in
(sometimes lexicalised) compounds
meaning ‘rise, get, fly up, etc.’.
daihͅto'tİdaki ‘I hung it up’ (a heavy
thing). 'daikwİki lona'na ‘(bat) entered
flying into the hole’. hoi dai'buiki
lona'na ‘bat flew out of the hole’. The
use of the reflexive may have a kind of
detransitivising or middle voice-like
effect. dai'daiwaki ‘two or three fly
up’ (when a multitude flies up, the
verb tsini'ri- is used).
daije- (V) fell away
daijeki ‘(the wind loosened and) took
(the things and they) fell outside’.koreja'ro daijenã'ra ‘take the pan from
the fire’. tͅiko'je dai'je?eki ‘they’re
six’ (lit. ‘five and one fell outside’).
daikwa- (V) take from vessel
dai'kwawaki ‘they took from inside (a
vessel)’, ko'sanã?ͿhͿ dai'kwacwaki
‘he stole (batteries) from the lantern’,
'pija kosa'nã dai'kwacwaki ‘they took
batteries from inside the lantern’.
daicotonӻ- (V) rise up, rise out of sleep
TE: *-tse. Probably from: dai-toto-nͿ‘take-up-REF’, but less correct when
pronounced as such (MA). The
reflexive element has a middle
voice-like effect: kan'wã?ato'to?yhͿ
daito'tonͿki ‘airplane rose upward’,
daico'tonͿ'ra ‘get up!’ (from the floor,
chair, bed (but not hammock)).
daicwa- (V) take from pan
Contains the DR -cwa- ‘up’, but this is
lexicalised on the verb, because
dai'cwadaki ‘I took up from the pan’,
can only relate to food from the pan.
daitxa- (V) open door
'lote dai'txadaki ‘I opened the door’.
daitxaku'ro'daitxaku'ro ‘(I) openedclosed-opened-closed (door)’. to'matx
dai'txadaki ‘I opened (the can of)
tomato paste’. lotİ 'daitxa?asanͿki ‘the
door is (left) open’.
daitxite- (V) lift up
*[daitxi'ce-]. Related to txite- ‘to pile
up’. daitxi'tedaki ‘I lift up (the ladder
and make it lean against the wall)’, ‘I
piled up (firewood in the yard)’, ‘I
(bought in the supermarket and) left
the things (there) piled up (to fetch
them later by car)’, ‘I put (a table) on
its side’. ywy'nwͿ daitxi'tedaki ‘I lift up
the wood’. daitxite'dwadaki ‘I put (the
cups) on the table’.
daiwa- (V-root) grab
Only attested in hetsy'se daiwa'kwİnİra ‘take inside the broom from

as in warja- and wanİ- etc. ‘to bring’.

remote past constructions: ca'rida'dayhͿki ‘I killed (him, a month ago)’,
ada'dayxyna a'?edamͿdaki ‘I’m going

"2985. The verb phrase5.2.2.1. Emphatic uses of the interrogative
There is a number of fixed constructions which require among other things an
interrogative matrix verb, but which do not really have an interrogative sense.
Their common characteristic is their emphatic nature. The interrogative can express indignation:
(1337)(tsuhǊ) 'dyrãrã=dyitxƭ'rjͿ-xa-re
what
noise=noise.make-2-INT
‘what is this noise you’re making (with empty cans)?’(1338)pİ̘rİ̘'jã=dyitxi'rjͿ-xa-re

‘they’re complaining that he does nothing but drink’(1340)kui-xa-'re=tja
'ta-wa-ta
drink-2-INT=CSO talk-IS-CSO
‘they say that you do nothing but drink’The interrogative is required in an expletive construction with the particle
ku'kui ‘wow!/yecch!/damn!/how strange!’, which is derived from the verb root
kukui- ‘hurt’ (see 7.7.6.):
(1341)ku'kui ñãsi-'he-da-re
(1342)
wow!
hear-NEG-1S-INT
‘damn, I can’t hear anything’(1343)kawa'pe

step=go.path-INT-1S-NOM-DECzjwãu-dy-jãhã-'na
João-POS-CL:path-LOC
‘gosh I saw MANY jaguar traces on the road to João!’
The interrogative is required in the expression of relief that something did not
happen. This construction also involves the first person inclusive pronoun
txana and the procrastinative morpheme -tjara-, which is a variant of -tara-:5.2. Mood(1345)299txa'nã awe-'he-tjara-re
rain-NEG-PROC-INT
we.IN
‘good that it did not rain!’This construction will be further discussed in (5.5.19.3.1.). More examples
were also given in (4.7.2.).
Regret or compassion can be expressed through the verb root daki- ‘it’s a
pity’, which is required in the cosubordinative as complement of an interrogative matrix verb:
(1346)da'ki-tja
tsͅi-'re
tear-INT
pity-CSO
‘a pity it (the cloth) tore’The second person interrogative form of the verb root awͿi- ‘see’ may function
as a tag question, not necessarily with its literal sense:181
(1347)ku'kui ywy'nwͿ nͿ-'nwͿ-re
a'wͿi-xa-re
wow
tree
big-CL:tree-INT see-2-INT
‘wow! that’s a big tree, isn’t it?’(1348)nͿ-nãi-'he-tsy-hͿ-herejã-re
awͿi-'he-xa-re
big-NOM-NEG-GER-NOM-APPL-INT see-NEG-2-INT
‘that is not much money, is it?’Note that in the latter example another lexicalised tag question construction is
used as well. The interrogative form of the appellative conjectural -herejã(which contains the existential verb jã- ‘to be’) is often cliticised to nominals in
order to draw the attention of the hearer, or even to express surprise about the
fact that (the hearer is so mal-informed that) it is necessary to mention the information at all. So there may be an extra connotation of self-evidence of the
facts expressed: ‘isn’t it?, of course!’ or even of irritation about the ignorance
of the hearer: ‘you fool!’. It is possible that -here contains a lexicalised interrogative mood marker (see 5.5.14.).

water submerge-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM perforate-DEC
‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’In example (3409) the antithetic phrase is a subordinated adverbial clause,
whereas in (3408) it is part of the matrix verb. The contrast between examples
(3408) and (3409) (repeated from 1375) suggests that the occurrence of -le-hͿ() inside the matrix clause represents a zero-verbalised noun-phrase rather than
an extension of the verb by a verbalising suffix. In fact, it may corroborate the
hypothesis that subordinate clauses in Kwaza are noun phrases.
-le-hͿ(-) is an analysable combination of different morphemes. In the first
place, -hͿ may be replaced by a specific classifier (see 4.2.):
(3410)a'xy ͅ'hike
'a-tsy-le-xy
house Henrique exist-GER-FRUST-CL:house

hã
I drink-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC water
‘it was me who was drinking water’366The contrast between the next examples in which the element -hͿ does not occur, also suggests that the element -le- has a sense of interrupted continuous

‘I nearly fell’The sense of ‘nearly’ is semantically related to the notion of ‘frustrative’ because it refers to the fact that something which was about to happen did not
happen after all, whether this is fortunate or not. Sometimes, a verb ending in
frustrative -le-hͿ can express this notion:

In this example, which is from the same text as (3744), the grandmother is trying to convince her daughter of not killing her own son. She tries to work on
the daughter’s consciousness by emphasising the fact that the boy is her son
and that he has searched for her in spite of the danger.
I see any negative interpretation of variants of the indignant construction as
a side-effect of the interrogative clause to which jã- is attached. In these examples, which all involve indignation or categorical negation, the only obligatory
element is the root jã-.","[750, 751]"
"3585. The verb phraseIn her article, Wise (2002) shows that a number of unrelated Peruvian Amazonian languages, such as Arabela and Iquito (Zaparo), Chayahuita (Cahuapana) and Yagua (Peba-Yagua) share applicative suffixes of the form
-ta/-tia. She asks the question whether this could be a North-Western Amazonian areal feature. However, in addition to Kwaza, also other languages in
South-Western Amazonia seem to have similar morphemes, such as the Aikanã
(unclassified) “transitiviser/classifier” -za- (Vasconcelos 2002), the Kanoê (unclassified) “transitiviser/classifier” -ta-/-to- (Bacelar 2004), the Karo (TupiRamarama) comitative/causative -ta- (Gabas 1999:83-86), the Moséten (unclassified) applicative -tya-/-te- (Sakel 2003:251-253) and possibly others.
5.4.2.1. Transitiviser -taThe morpheme -ta- is often used to transitivise unambiguously intransitive
verbs. It introduces a dative-like object which can sometimes even be regarded
as comitative:
(1712)hyja-'ta-ki
fall-TRA-DEC
‘it fell in front of him’(1713)magariDa-'wã 'bu=Ǌ-rjͿ-ta-ki
Margarida-AO put=be-CD:area-TRA-DEC
‘it is sitting next to Margarida’Introduced animate objects which are overtly expressed are usually marked
with -wã (see 4.1.1.). In the following example the object is implicit, and both
of the nouns which surround the verb function as locative adverbs (see 6.2.3.):
(1714)tja?a'tje 'a-ta-ki
ma'rjãu-dy-rjͿ
close
exist-TRA-DEC Marião-POS-CD:area
‘he is living close to Marião’The transitiviser usually precedes subject cross-reference morphemes, and
when non-third persons are involved, it also precedes transitive object
cross-reference:
(1715)a-'ta-ta-ki
exist-TRA-1O-DEC
‘is together with me’(1716)tsuhǊ-'du-tsy-lİ

Mario hide-TRA-1O-DEC I-AO
‘Mario hid from me’Furthermore, the transitiviser is sometimes applied to verbs which are already transitive. The verb waja- ‘to bring, take’ can be considered as inherently
transitive. The application of transitiviser -ta- introduces an extra object with a
recipient function:
(1721)waja-'ta-ki
bring-TRA-DEC
‘he is taking it there to him’The derived verbal stem in (1721) should be considered as ditransitive. Without
the transitiviser -ta- it is transitive. Note that transitive verbs which involve
non-third person arguments always bear transitive object cross-reference. Note
furthermore that first person singular object cross-reference is homophonous
with the transitiviser -ta-. Compare (1721) to the following example:
(1722)wa'ja-ta-ki
bring-1O-DEC
‘he took me’The different stress patterns obviously disambiguate the transitiviser from the
cross-reference morpheme. If the rule is that the main stress position is on the
ultimate syllable of the uninflected stem, the transitiviser is to be considered
part of the stem.221 Verbs marked for transitivisation sometimes show a
221.In fact, stress may be one of the criteria for the distinction between inflexional and
derivational morphology in Kwaza. However, I have tried to ignore this question in
the present work.","[395, 396, 397]"
"5.6. Nominalisation(2448)471ace'rjͿ-ki onİ-'nã-tsy-nãi
close-DEC arrive-FUT-GER-NOM
‘his arrival is close’, ‘he is going to arrive soon’Unlike other nouns, nouns formed by the morpheme -nãi cannot be possessed:
(2449)*si-dy-hͿ kwİ-da-nãi
I-POS-NOM inside-1S-NOM
‘my entering’Besides a nominalising function, -nãi may also have adverbialising functions. Sometimes it is difficult to decide whether a verb in -nãi is used nominally or adverbially:
(2450)hyriko'ro
tu'rwe-tse ku'kuihͿ-nãi
ill-NOM
monkey
heal-DEC
‘the monkey got better from a disease’In the present analysis, adverbs formed by -nãi are regarded as nouns from the
point of view of morphological analysis, but as adverbs from a semantic point
of view. They are discussed extensively in section (6.2.4.2.).
5.6.3. The first person plural cross-reference morpheme -aAs demonstrated in the previous sections, verbs which are nominalised by -hͿ
or -nãi retain person marking. This person marking may be expressed by overt
cross-reference morphemes or, in case of a third person, by zero-marking.
Cross-reference markers occur in nominalised verbs without any change of
meaning, except for the first person plural. When applied before nominalisation
by -hͿ, -nãi and, possibly, -hͿwã (see 5.6.4.below), the first person plural
marker -a- may get a non-personal sense. Under its occurrence in such instances, the verb is interpreted as if it is not inflected for person at all, be it
overt or covert. In a way, the first person plural marker enables the creation of
an abstract noun.
When -a- is applied before the nominaliser -hͿ, the result is often something
that resembles an infinitive-like action noun:
(2451)tsu'tsu-hͿ
urinate-NOM
‘the one that urinates’(2452)tsu'tsu-a-hͿ
urinate-1P-NOM
‘urinating, to urinate’4725. The verb phrase(2453)i'si=Ǌi-da-hͿ-ki

heal-again-1P-NOM
‘to resuscitate’(2454)i'si=Ǌi-a-hͿ
die=lie-1P-NOM
‘epilepsy’The application of -a-hͿ results in a noun. The following examples show that
the verbal root of such a noun may retain an argument:
(2456)ko'reja
knife
‘file’'kjͅ-a-hͿ
sharpen-1P-NOM(2457)mƭu
wy'ru-a-hͿ

‘pornographic video tape’(2458)atxi'txi dudu'ñǊ-a-hͿ
maize pound-1P-NOM
‘mortar’ (lit. ‘thing to
pund maize in (for flour)’)Nota that in spite of the fact that the above examples involve juxtaposition of
nouns, these nouns only rarely seem to modify one another (see 4.3.):
(2460)hi
ha'bi-a-hͿ
firewood ignite-1P-NOM
‘firewood for ignition’Another example may be (2463) below.
The abstract noun has often a connotation of ‘with respect to’ or of purpose:
(2461)warja-'ra kui-'dy-a-hͿ
drink-CAU-1P-NOM
take-IMP
‘take something to drink to him!’(2462)Q: tsǊhǊ-'nãi pİ̘rİ̘'jã-nã-a-re
what-NOM speak-FUT-1P-INT
‘what will we talk about?’A: 'mƭu-dy-a-hͿ
chicha-CAU-1P-NOM
‘about making chicha’ (t)The result of nominalisation with -a- may also resemble an agent noun. Two
possible translations were offered for the word mƭudy?ahͿ in the above example: ‘in order to make chicha’ and (although considered less appropriate)5.6. Nominalisation473‘maker of chicha’. This semantic ambiguity can be explained better with the
following example:
(2463)'tauBa a'xy-dy-a-hͿ
board
house-CAU-1P-NOM
‘boards to build a house’266According to the consultant the word axydy?ahͿ can be translated both as ‘in
order to make a house’ and as ‘maker of a house’. This is apparently because of
the fact that the involved boards both serve the builder to make a house and
constitute the house themselves.267 The next example represents an instrument
noun:
(2464)'a-a-hͿ
exist-1P-NOM
‘(once-) inhabited place / house’In the translations offered by the consultants of the nominalisations discussed here, -a- seems to behave as sort of infinitive marker meaning something like ‘(thing) with reference to V-ing’. Literally, however, all occurrences
of -a- can and should be regarded as first person plural cross-reference. In some
of the following examples, I have added a literal translation. The result of -a-hͿ
can be zero-verbalised:
(2465)ou-'dy-a-hͿ-ki
catch-CAU-1P-NOM-DEC
‘it’s to hook up (i.e. a clip)’ (lit. ‘it’s a thing which we hook up with’)(2466)to'mã=jã-hͿ-le-ki
/ to'mã-a-hͿ-le-ki
bathe-1P-NOM-FRUST-DEC
bathe=be-NOM-FRUST-DEC
‘it was for bathing (but now it has broke down)’268
(lit. ‘it was a thing by which we bathed’)The nominaliser -hͿ is also a classifier. The next example shows that it can
be replaced by more specific classifiers also when it is preceded by nonpersonal -a-:266.The order 21 is also allowed.
267.Germanic and Romance languages have words that have the form of an agent noun,
even though they refer to patient, instrument or locative nouns, e.g. English drawer
‘box which can be drawn out of a piece of furniture by its handle’, Dutch hanger
‘thing which is instrumental in hanging up clothes’, and Spanish comedor ‘dining
room’.
268.This is an answer to the question ‘what is this pipe for?’.","[508, 509, 510, 511]"
"6148. Subordination and coordinationThis future perspective can be embedded in a past context:

‘he knows the water is cold’ (TMA:117)(3265)ja

awy-'mǊ-tsy-nãi
already know-NOM-DEC cold-CL:liquid-POT-NOM
‘he knew (yesterday) the water would be cold (today)’ (TMA:118)8.1.2. Gerundi(v)al -tsyIn certain positions inside the verb the element -tsy- clearly does not have a
potential sense and it can apparently not be related to the potential morpheme
-tsy- dealt with in the preceding section. The unidentified element -tsy- seems
to be another morpheme with a different meaning, but its exact semantic contents are difficult to establish. Depending on the semantics of the specific verb
stem to which it is attached it may have a durative, progressive or resultative
effect, but its principal function is mildly emphatic. Because it is usually followed by a nominaliser, and because this combination replaces declarative -tse
on many occasions, I have analysed it provisionally as a gerundial morpheme:
(3266)lo'te e-'he-tse
door have-NEG-DEC
‘there is no door’(3267)lo'te e-'he-tsy-hͿ
door have-NEG-GER-NOM
‘without door’There could be a morphophonological relation between -tsy- and declarative
-tse. The main reason why -tsy- is not regarded here as an outright allomorph of
-tse is because -tse is analysed as a verb-final mood marker. If a verb is nominalised, the mood marker is normally truncated and replaced by the nominalising morpheme. Nevertheless, formal, distributional and perhaps semantic correspondences warrant the suspicion that gerundial -tsy- may derive from declarative -tse.
Example (3267) above means literally: ‘the one not having a door’. It is
possible that -tsy- has an emphatic cleft function. In the following examples,
-tsy- causes contrastive focus:
(3268)nͿ-'xy-tsy-hͿ
big-CL:house-GER-NOM
‘the big house’ (lit. ‘that which functions as a big house’)(3269)xyi tei-'hͿ-tsy-hͿ

‘you saw the one who is just one’8.1. The form -tsy-615The phrase in example (3268) was uttered as an answer to the question: ‘which
one do you want?’. The fact that -hͿ is a nominaliser which can be replaced by
a specific classifier (see also 4.2.) is a reason to regard -tsy- as an element
which is not inextricably fused with -hͿ:
(3270)koreja'ri
nͿ-'ri-tsy-ri

‘I want to dance with her’(1060)ba'baice-e'te-nã-ta-ki
dance-COMIT-FUT-1O-DEC
‘She wants to dance with me’The morpheme -etelexwa-, however, appears not to be able to convey this
comitative sense:
(1061)*babaice-etelexwa-da-mͿ
dance-2PO-1S-VOL
‘I want to dance with you (pl)’The element -le- resembles the reciprocal form -lİ- (see 5.4.7.), but it is not
certain that there is a relation.
The element -xwa- is formally identical to a similar element occurring in
several indefinite subject morphemes, which again resembles the basic indefinite subject marker -wa-. There is an analogous situation involving -ja- in
-eteja-. However, -xwa- also resembles the masculine classifier -xwa- and it
can be optionally replaced by its feminine counterpart -tay-. Nevertheless, the
form with -xwa- (-etelexwa-) can refer to female objects as well:
(1062)haje-'hͿ-etele'xwa-da-ki
(1063)
paint-NOM-2PO-1S-DEC
‘I painted you all (female/male)’haje-'hͿ-etele'tay-da-ki
paint-NOM-2PO.FEM-1S-DEC
‘I painted you all (female)’The consultant translated etele'tay in isolation as ‘with you women’.
On two occasions, the element -etele- was attested without subsequent
-xwa- or -tay-:
(1064)mani'ni wa'dy-etele-'nã-a-xa-hͿ-ki

‘we’re going to give fish to you (PL)’(1065)mani'ni wa'dy-etele-a-'xa-ki
fish
give-2PO-1P-AS-DEC
‘I’m giving fish to my mate’, ‘we’re giving fish’The correspondence between the form of (1065) and its meaning as represented
by the free translations is not understood well. It could be that they were distorted by the elicitation setting and that the consultant just meant ‘we’re giving
fish to you (PL)’. It is unclear how productive the bare element -etele- is. The
equivalent of (1065) with a first person singular subject was rejected by the
consultant.
The question of inclusive and exclusive subjects in combination with the
second person plural object is illustrated in (5.1.2.) below.","[289, 290]"

At the beginning of the tale, Maria Edite explains why she knows so few
tales. It is unclear from whom she learnt the present tale. It is probably a very
ancient story, as the themes of giving birth to a snake, and the snake as the origin of the rainbow are found in oral traditions of indigenous peoples all over
Amazônia. With respect to some sentences in the story, Teteru complained that
the structure was rambled and therefore hard to translate as a logically structured narrative. Later, Mario said that Maria Edite had omitted certain parts. As
an example, she omitted the beginning of the story in which it should be announced that the story is about the question of why the Kwaza word for ‘rainbow’ is the same as the word for ‘anaconda’ and general ‘snake’: deda.455

parts of the root. Secondly, the ostensible morphological structure cannot be
altered, because, as an example, -hͿ cannot be replaced by another morpheme:
*awani-ki, *awani-xy, etc., and hence, -hͿ is not a productive nominaliser or
classifier here.
The adverbs are canonically employed to modify predicates. The following

drinking:
(2165)'kui-herejã-hͿ
drink-APPL-NOM
‘I think he was drinking, wasn’t he?’Or it is used to express irritation at someone who is nagging. The following example was given in a context where the hearer has tried to tease the speaker
about (the latter) not drinking enough chicha:

(1351)awe-'nã-tehere
rain-FUT-APPR
‘I think it is going to rain’Finally, there is a focus suffix -rati- (see 7.2.8.) which is often combined with a
question word in an interrogative matrix sentence:
(1352)tsuhǊ-ra'ti-wã hã
'ta-a-re
what-FOC-AO water say-1P-INT
‘what does “hã” mean?’(1353)wai-ra'ti-re
good-FOC-INT
‘is it delicious?’The specific morphemes involved in the emphatic interrogative expressions
will be treated more extensively in the aforementioned sections.
5.2.2.2. Gerundial -tsy- in the interrogative
As we have seen in third person examples like (1331) the interrogative marker
is attached to the zero-marked verb root. Although there is no alternation in the
interrogative between forms comparable to declarative -ki and -tse, there is a
morpheme which resembles -tse. The element -tsy- may be inserted between
subject cross-reference marking (which is zero for the third person) and interrogative -re. No solid explanations have been found with regard to its presence
or absence. Alternatively, the element -tsy- often occurs in nominalised constructions that can be identified as gerundial and which end in -tsy-hͿ (see
8.1.2.). There is a morpheme that is homophonous with -tsy-, but which has
been identified as an potential tense/aspect marker. Although I see no compelling reason to relate it to declarative -tse and gerundial -tsy-, it does have a
somewhat similar distribution, which may lead to ambiguity in the interrogative. Compare the following examples to (1331):
(1354)di'lİ 'cu-tsy-re
who cut-GER-INT
‘who cut (the tree)?’di'lİ 'cu-tsy-re
who cut-POT-INT
‘who is going to cut (the tree)?’The example in which -tsy- is analysed as gerundial has a past tense reading
when contrasted to present tense (1331) and to the potential construction that
has a future tense interpretation. It is unclear whether -tsy- is an allomorph of
declarative -tse in the third person interrogative or whether it is a different
morpheme. Probably the function of gerundial -tsy- is to give an extra cleft-like
effect, like ‘who could it be who ...?’ or ‘what could it be that ...?’. Note that in
case of verb stem ellipsis, -tsy- always precedes -re. In fact, tsyre is often used5.2. Mood301as a free minimal response particle, with a potential connotation of doubt: ‘is
it?’, ‘would it be?’, ‘I don’t know’. The element -tsy- is dealt with extensively
in section (8.1.). Gerundial -tsy- in combination with the interrogative is discussed further in (8.1.2.1.).
5.2.3. Imperative
The imperative mood marker -ra is used to indicate the speech act of commanding by which the hearer can be required, requested or invited to do something. The imperative marker attracts stress.
(1355)wady-'ra
give-IMP
‘give (it to him)!’(1357)e'tay-nahere-wã wa'dy-ja-'ra

go-IMP
‘go!’182Two possible subjects have been attested for imperative verbs: second person
singular, which is zero-marked, and second person plural, which is marked by
-xa-. Zero-marking is explicitly indicated only in the first two of the examples
below:
(1359)ka'we
kui-Ø-'ra
coffee drink-2-IMP
‘drink coffee!’ (2sg)(1360)ka'we
'kui-Ø-xa-'ra

(*o'ja?e'texaxa'ra)
you.PL leave-COMIT-AS-IMP
‘you are going with them!’ (2pl)These examples show that in contrast to the declarative, where unmarked person represents third person, the default value of the imperative is second per
182.According to MA this answer is a bit harsh. Nicer is: tsy're ‘would it be?’3025. The verb phraseson. The second person plural imperative is marked by -xa-, and this form contrasts with second person plural form -xa-xa- of the declarative and other
moods. The following examples represent strong evidence for this:
(1363)(1364)xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-ra
you
hit-AS-IMP
‘you hit!’vs.xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-xa-ki
you
hit-2-AS-DEC
‘you hit’xyi aky-'ta
e'mã-xa-xa-ta o'ja-xa-ra
more-2-AS-CSO leave-AS-IMP
you two-ANI
‘you three, go to Barroso!’Ba'hozo-na
Barroso-LOCAs explained in (5.1.), the element -xa-xa- consists of the second person element -xa- and a homophonous associated person marker -xa-. Considering the
fact that second person is zero-marked for the singular subject of the imperative, it is likely that it is also zero-marked for a plural subject. Therefore, the
element -xa- in the second person plural imperative represents associated person, and not second person.
In spite of the fact that -xa- in most imperative sentences represents a plural
subject, there are examples of the imperative in which -xa- is used for second
person singular. In the next example, which is from a mythical tale, the enchanted tapir is being addressed by a group of women:
(1365)huruja=du'hͿ-İteja-xa-ra
like=all-1PO-2-IMP
‘make love to us all!’ (t)Compare this example to (1356). The tapir from this tale is a singular being
with a solitary life. And far as I am aware no special register was used in this
tale. Therefore, I have interpreted -xa- as a second person subject marker.
Imperative verbs were never attested bearing any other subject person
marking than either zero or -xa-. Imperative verbs can be marked for any kind
of object and the same forms are used as in the declarative, with one exception.
The declarative first person object -ta- corresponds to the imperative (and
monitory) first person singular object -ta?Ϳ-:
(1366)wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-'ra (*wadytara)

see-NOM-1SO-AS-IMP
‘help!’ (lit. ‘you pl. look at me!’)303The negative imperative is expressed by a different morpheme -ky, which
will be treated in (5.2.7.). Nevertheless, some instances of a negative morpheme in combination with imperative -ra were attested. They are rather emphatic:
(1371)ehͿ-'he-ca-ra
make-NEG-EMP-IMP
‘don’t do that!’(1372)ja-'he-ca-xa-ra
eat-NEG-EMP-2-IMP
‘(since you didn’t work)
you (PL) are nót going to eat!’Note that -ra is not immediately attached to negative -he- in this construction.
The intervening element -ca- will be discussed below in section (5.2.3.3.).
5.2.3.1. -tsy- as an imperative element
No mitigated version of the imperative has been identified with absolute certainty. Sometimes the imperative can be expressed by an alternative construction which involves the potential/future morpheme -tsy-:
(1373)hako're
oja'nͿ-e-ra
/ hako're
tomorrow return-again-IMP/ tomorrow
‘tomorrow you (sg/pl) come again’ojanͿ-'?e-xa-tsy-tse

imperative construction is (note that both are embedded as reported speech
constructions, see 5.5.11.).

‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’3045. The verb phraseThe difference between overt and zero marked second person in the imperative
construction with potential -tsy- is discussed in section (8.1.1.1.).
The consultant regarded the imperative content of the alternative expressions as equally strong or equally nice. On one occasion, however, the potential
construction was indicated as a mitigated and possibly euphemistic alternative
to the imperative:
(1376)wayrjͿ-'ra
clean-IMP
‘clean!’/way'rjͿ-xa-tsy-tsİ
clean-2-POT-DEC
‘you may clean’5.2.3.2. -ta as an imperative element
The procrastinative morpheme -tara- ‘later’, ‘do first’ was discussed above and
demonstrated in example (1268). In the declarative it cannot precede -ki but
only -tsİ. In the imperative it can only be succeeded by a verb-final element -ta.
This element -ta is not a cosubordinative marker, as it is clearly imperative in
combination with -tara-.
(1377)e'hͿ-tara-'ta
make-PROC-IMP
‘do that first! (before going away)’(1378)ka'we 'kui-tara-'ta
(1379)
coffeedrink-PROC-IMP
‘drink coffee first!, wait for the coffee!’here?ece-'hͿ-tara-'ta
rest-NOM-PROC-IMP
‘rest first!’Maybe -ta should be regarded as an allomorph of -ra, although it only occurs in
this construction. The morpheme -tara- is involved in several different constructions and will be treated by itself in section (5.5.19.).
5.2.3.3. The problem of imperative -ca
Imperative -ra may be preceded by the element -ca-, which is usually pronounced as [ta] but sometimes also as [tja]. Out of considerations which will be
explained towards the end of this section, I have provisionally identified -ca- as
an emphatic morpheme.
There are several verb stems which allow the application of -ca- in the imperative without any obvious semantic or pragmatic consequences. The only
consequence -ca- seems to have in the next example is the shift of stress:5.2. Mood(1380)koreja'ro waja-'ra
pan
bring-IMP
‘take the pan!’(1381)'cutse(')rjͿ-(ca)-'ra
lie-EMP-IMP
‘stay lying down!’/
/305koreja'ro wa'ja-ca-ra
pan
bring-EMP-IMPWith some verbs the element -ca- seems to have an effect on the meaning of
the utterance. In the next examples it is hard to determine what is the exact nature of this effect, because the demonstrative ayhͿ ‘that one (close to hearer)’
may co-determine the effect:
(1382)ay'hͿ dai-'ra
that grab-IMP
‘take thát one (which
we know, close or not)’(1383)ay'hͿ 'dai-ca-ra
that grab-EMP-IMP
‘take this one there! (i.e. the
one over there close to you)’Notice that besides the stress shift, the demonstrative in the latter example received extra heavy and probably emphatic or contrastive stress. This may confirm the suspicion that -ca- has an emphatic function. The next two examples
were considered as fully equivalent by MA, but to ZE there was a difference in
emphasis:
(1384)koreja'ro wa'ja-nͿ-'ra
pan
bring-REF-IMP
‘bring here the pan!’(1385)koreja'ro waja-'nͿ-ca-'ra
pan
bring-REF-EMP-IMP
‘I’m telling you, bring here the
pan (I’ve asked you before)!’The distinction between less emphatic and more emphatic literal equivalents of
the last example also involves -ca-, besides the combination of the nominaliser
plus the resignation morpheme -hͿ-tsy which may have emphatic and/or past
connotations (see 5.5.17.). Example (1387) is clearly an emphatic cleft construction:
(1386)koreja'ro
waja-nͿ-'ra-da-hͿ-tsy
pan
bring-REF-IMP-1S-NOM-RES
‘I said to you bring the pan!’(1387)koreja'ro

pan
bring-REF-EMP-IMP be-NOM-RES
‘I’m telling you bring here the pan (I’ve asked you before)!’3065. The verb phraseWith certain verbs the use of -ca- was considered correct by some people, but
incorrect by others. The next example was rejected by ZE, but accepted by
MA:
(1388)txu'hǊi mãmã'ñe-(*)ca-ra

occasion it was considered as incorrect by the very same person (MA):

another one:

‘do like that!’(1391)magariDa-dy'nͿ nãi-(*ca)-'ra
Margarida-COMIT like-EMP-IMP

a'ruca'ra‘cross!’
‘jump!’(1394)kurira
ku'rica'ra‘quiet! (don’t move)’
‘quiet! (don’t speak)’(1395)koreja'ro warja'ra
‘take the pan with you!’
koreja'ro wa'rjacara ‘hold the pan! (for me)’There are some possible explanations for the consultants’ different opinions
about the applicability and meaning of -ca-. It is quite possible that the dialect
of MA, who is from the mixed family I, has changed because of intensive con5.2. Mood307tact with the surrounding languages in the indigenous reserve. A related possibility is that there is more uncertainty among family I about the use of -ca-, and
that this is due to phenomena of linguistic attrition or obsolescence. Family II
forms a more closed and less plurilingual community in which Kwaza is the
only language used on a daily basis among all members. Another, important
complementary explanation is that the use of -ca- depends less on semantic
factors than on pragmatic factors, and that my methodology of direct elicitation
and translation of short phrases outside of a discourse context is wrong because
it does not make visible the function of -ca-. For the time being I am inclined to
attach most value to ZE’s remarks about -ca- and consider it as an emphatic
marker used in the imperative.
Note that the element -ca- is never used in combination with any other
mood morpheme than -ra and the cosubordinative. In the next example -caoccurs in a phrase cosubordinated to an imperative matrix phrase:
(1396)nãi-ca-ta
oce-'ra
like-EMP-CSO throw-IMP
‘throw it away like that!’Finally, note that -ca- succeeds the element -he- in an emphatic negative
construction in examples (1371) and (1372). This is also the only construction
in which -ca- is preceded by person marking.
5.2.3.4. Imperative particles
The combination of the elements -ca- and -ra is also used independently in elliptic constructions (see also 7.5.2.):
(1397)R:ja-'e-da-mͿ
eat-again-1S-VOL
‘I’m going to eat again’A:ca-'raEMP-IMP‘do that!’, ‘yes!’The answer to the remark can be said to derive from the expression ja'?eca'ra
‘eat again!’ of which the stem is omitted. It is likely that this ellipsis led to the
emergence of an auxiliary-like verbal particle cara ‘order, send’:
(1398)zjwãu ca-'ra 'ta-ta-ki
João EMP-IMP say-1O-DEC
‘João sent me’ (lit. ‘João said “go!” to me’)(1399)zjwãu-'wã ca-'ra 'ta-da-ki
EMP-IMP say-1S-DEC
João-AO
‘I sent João’3085. The verb phraseIn a similar fashion the verb-like particle ratja ‘order him’, ‘insist’ must
have emerged. In this case the imperative morpheme -ra functions as the root,
in a fixed combination with -tja-, which probably originates from a transitiviser. ratja- shows more resemblance to a normal transitive verb stem than does
cara:
(1400)ratja-'ra

‘send him!/tell him to!’e-'nƭ-da-ta

The verb-final exhortative morpheme -ni is pronounced as [ni] or [nƭ]. It can be
applied to verbs cross-referring to the first person inclusive subject by -a-, indefinite subject by -wa and zero-marked third person subject.

‘let’s live (there) and dry maize and eat fish!’ (t)5.2.4.1. -nƭ- as a causational bound modal morpheme
The exhortative has a purposive sense in certain constructions:
(1416)e'nãi-ca-ra
bui-'ni
quarrel-EMP-IMP leave-EXH
‘quarrel so that (the dog) leaves (the house)!’3105. The verb phrase(1417)dytenã-'ra

‘extinguish the candle so we can get some sleep!’(1418)dyte'nã-a-ni
wã'wͿi-wa-ni
extinguish-1P-EXH sleep-IS-EXH
‘let’s extinguish the candle so they can get some sleep!’In other constructions -ni may be considered as a purposive or causational modal morpheme: -nƭ- ‘to make (someone do something)’, which is pronounced
[nƭ] rather than [ni]. It occurs often, but not necessarily, in subordinate constructions and it has a valency-increasing effect:
(1419)'mã-da-ki onİ-'nƭ-da-'ta

Hermes-(*AO) take-CAUS-1S-CSO wait-NOM-1S-DEC
I’m waiting for Hermes to take food first’In these causational constructions, the sentential subject is not identical with
the embedded agentive subject of the verb root. In (1419) subject of onİ- ‘to
come’ is not expressed by cross-reference marking. However, the subject of
onİnƭ- ‘to make him come’ is. Compare the following examples:
(1423)kuraku'ra ja-'dy-da-ki
Ǌi-'nƭ-da-ta
chicken
eat-CAU-1S-DEC lie-CAUS-1S-CSO
‘I feed the chickens so that they can sleep’(1424)kuraku'ra ja-'dy-da-ki

(1425)'ja
kui-'nƭ-da-ki
already drink-CAUS-1S-DEC
‘I already let (him) drink’It also occurs in certain, relatively fixed, expressions:
(1426)'ƭ

idly good-NOM-CAUS-IS-CSO=like
‘for no reason, to make beautiful, that’s how they do’ (t)(1427)ti-nãi-ƭ-'nƭ-xa-ta
'ja-xa-re
what-NOM-NEG-CAUS-2-CSO eat-2-INT
‘why do you eat (peppers)?’Notice that on the following transitive verb, the causational appears to function
as a reflexive, with the connotation of ‘to do by accident’:
(1428)hadai-'nͿ-da-ki
hack-REF-1S-DEC
‘I cut myself (on purpose)’(1429)hadai-'nƭ-da-ki
hack-CAUS-1S-DEC
‘I cut myself (by accident)’Because this construction involving -nƭ- is the result of post-cliticising complementation similar to the reported speech construction, it will also be discussed in (5.5.15.). The causational construction resembles the volitional construction with -damͿ- ‘to want’ discussed in (5.2.5.1.). An important difference
is that the causational morpheme is never preceded by subject crossreference.183
5.2.4.2. Exhortative paucal -jaAn alternative exhortative construction involving the element -ja(-) is suspected to have a paucal connotation.
(1430)(txi'rja) mamañe-'ja (txi'rja) mama'ñe-a-'ni

everyone sing-EXP
‘let us (two or three persons) sing!’‘let us (many, all) sing!’It is encountered only with a first person inclusive subject and not with any
other persons or moods: *İ'jadaki, *İ'jaki. It usually occurs verb-finally behaving as a mood marker.
183.But see the remark about this construction in note (12) in (7.5.2.3.).","[337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349]"
"5.5. Tense, modality and aspect437thing. Probably, it was lexicalised in the present construction with a modal
sense ‘fortunately’. This would also help to explain the fact that -tara- occurs
in a position adjacent to -ki.
5.5.19.1. Persuasive mood in combination with -taraThe above supersection demonstrates how the state of affairs as expressed by
the verb root can be postponed by procrastinative -tara-. In the present subsection, it will be shown that -tara- has the opposite effect when combined with
persuasive moods. In this combination procrastination happens on behalf of the
state of affairs expressed by the verb root, while another, implicit state of affairs is postponed.
With the exhortative mood, discussed in (5.2.4.), -tara- means ‘to do first,
before anything else’ rather than ‘to do later’:
(2232)'ja-a-tara-ni
eat-1P-PROC-EXH
‘let’s (IN) eat first!’(2233)'ja-a-xa-tara-ni

‘let him eat first’(2235)'wai-dy-tara-'ja
good-CAU-PROC-EXP
‘let’s make the food tasteful!’In order to express ‘let (him) eat later!’, a more analytic construction is used,
which involves a preconditional adverbial clause (see 8.2.1.3.) and a declarative matrix clause containing -tara-:
(2236)'ja-tara-tse
kuriku'ri-tsy-lİ

eat-1P-PROC-DECIn the following examples, -tara- in combination with the exhortative mood
morpheme -ni is embedded in an elliptic quotation construction (see 5.5.11.):
(2238)bohyja-tara-'ni-xa-he-re
burn.up-PROC-CAUS-2-NEG-INT
‘why don’t you let it burn up? (instead of extinguishing the cigarette
halfway)’ (lit. ‘don’t you say “let it burn up first!”?’)4385. The verb phrase(2239)be-tara-'ni-xa-he-re

ripe-PROC-CAUS-IS-NEG-INT
‘why don’t they wait for (the fruit) to ripen?’
(lit. ‘don’t they say “let it ripen first!”?’)Also in the imperative, -tara- means ‘to do first’. However, it was shown in
(5.2.3.2.) that it can only be succeeded by a verb-final element -ta, instead of
the expected imperative marker -ra:
(2241)'ja-tara-'ta
eat-PROC-IMP
‘eat first! (before going away)’(2242)ka'we
oxote-'hͿ-tara-ta
coffee stalk-NOM-PROC-IMP
‘wait for the coffee first!’(2243)here?ece-hͿ-tara-'ta
rest-NOM-PROC-IMP
‘rest first!’In order to express ‘eat later!’, a construction similar to (2236) is used, albeit
without -tara-:
(2244)kuriku'ri-xa-lİ
'ja-xa-tsy-tse
little.later-2-PREC eat-2-POT-DEC
‘you (SG) eat later!’It has not been attested whether the matrix clause can be in the canonical imperative instead of the present mitigated imperative (as discussed in 5.2.3.1.).
In section (5.2.5.) it was shown that in combination with -tara- ‘later’ the
volitive -mͿ does not bear the expected first person subject cross-reference
morphemes:
(2245)here?ece-hͿ-tara-'mͿ

problems, but the construction is considered better without:

bathe-1S-PROC-VOL
‘let me take a bath first’Although the usual sense of -tara- in the volitive mood is ‘to do first’, with
the verb ja- ‘to eat’, -tara- seems to have both opposite meanings ‘to do later’
and ‘to do first’. In the first sense eating is postponed until later. In the second
sense, eating takes place first, with the implication that something else is postponed. It is not entirely predictable which sense is intended:
(2250)ha-ha-nͿ-'tsa-tara-mͿ

‘I’m going to wash my hands first’(2251)ha-ha-nͿ-tsa=hã'rã-ta

clean-clean-REF-CL:hand=stop-CSO eat-PROC-VOL
‘I’m going to wash my hands first, then I’ll eat’2585.5.19.2. Interrogative mood in combination with -taraProcrastinative -tara- was seldom attested in interrogative clauses. In one type
of construction, the resulting sense is ‘to be already’:
(2252)atsi'le-tara-re
(2253) kawİ
'hoi-tara-re
coffee sweet-PROC-INT
heavy-PROC-INT
‘is it heavy (enough) already?’ ‘is the coffee (quite) sweet already?’In a way, -tara- in these examples may have a modal connotation of ‘fortunately’ as well. The question in (2252) anticipates a positive answer, because
people (both sellers and buyers) generally want blocks of latex to be heavy.
258.The sentence 'ja-tara-mͿ ‘I’m going to eat first’ was also attested with the sense
‘let’s eat later’, but this was rejected on a later occasion.","[474, 475, 476, 477]"

classifier -kuty- ‘head’, refers to the
spherical shape of covered things, and
not necessarily to the head of the
covered person.
-hehӻ (svv) CONT
The contrastive aspect-like morpheme
comes in the place of a matrix mood
marker. It expresses usually some kind
of counterpresupposition. (Warning):
tse'wedy'tõihata'tsi ‘take care that the
toad doesn’t spit you in the eye’, A:

It is also encountered in an idiomatic
expression: nãi'nãi a'wͿiwa'ta 'nãiwahe'hͿ ‘they will see, just wait!’ (MA
commented that this is men’s talk).
hehӻsi (PART) well, then, in that case
Sort of tail-head linking particle,

-here (svv) INTL
The intentional is one of three
conjectural modal-like morphemes. It
usually indicates an unsuccessful
attempt. It may consist originally of
negative -he- and interrogative -re.
aty'tahͿhe're ‘they thought he was still
there’, atsu'ka ehe'redale'ki ‘I thought

there isn’t)’, kuida'hͿhe'retsy'hͿwara
‘I tried to drink but (e.g. I burnt my
mouth)’.
-herejã- (svv) APPL
The appellative is one of three
conjectural modal-like morphemes. It
usually expresses an (either edifying,
ironical or even irritated) appeal to the
hearer’s knowledge, translatable as the
tag question ‘isn’t it?’. It may consist
originally of negative -he-, interrogative -re and a compounded verb root
jã- ‘to be’. It is often followed by
interrogative mood marking, without
interrogative meaning. kuida'hͿhe'rejã're ‘(don’t) you see that I’m drinking’, cu'kuhe'rejã're ‘(it is called the)
tongue’.
here?ece- (V) rest
'İdata here?ecehͿ'nãdaki ‘I’ll go away

hesyse (N) liana, broom, straw
Also [hetsy'se]. Broom of straw of the
assai palm tree. Also the liana of
which sieves are made. 'hetsy'se
nͿ'seki ‘big broom’. Probably related
to hetsy'xe ‘leaf’.
hesyxe (N) leaf
Also [hetsy'se] ~ [hİsy'se]. 'hetsy'xe
nͿ'xeki ‘big leaf’.
-heta- (svv) DESI
This suffix follows the (zero)
cross-reference morpheme which
represents the agent subject of the verb
root. At the same time it precedes the
(zero) cross-reference morpheme2. Kwaza-English vocabulary
which represents the desiderator
subject, who wishes the occurrence of
the event expressed by the verb root.
Immediately before the third person
declarative only -tse is used. zjwãu

something to do with the fact that the864Dictionarytree is smooth, which symbolises
elusiveness of game. hİ also refers to
the big chicha mortar, because it is

stone.stone big-CL:stone-DEC
‘the stone is big’
The word ha'ki ‘stone’ is considered as obsolete nowadays, but it was used by
the old people, and closely similar forms are found in Aikanã (ha'ži) and Kanoê
(a'ki) today.
The unidentifiable root kaxa- may be etymologically related to verbs like
kay- ‘scratch’, kakani- ‘itch’.
Some verbs also contain lexicalised classifiers, such as -ro ‘cup, container’
in the verb root bobo'ro- ‘make dents’. The element -ro- cannot be omitted nor
replaced by another classifier.
4.2.1.11. Free lexical forms and the empty root
In Kwaza, a classifier is a bound morpheme that never occurs by itself as an independent word. The closest it can get to independent occurrence is when attached to the empty word-formative root e-. In this position, classifiers create a
general or a prototypical noun belonging to the corresponding class.

Ø-CL:woman

Ø-CL:leg
‘(its) lower leg’The empty root in Kwaza often occurs in words which denote things or beings
which are part of something. For example, there is no “leg” without it being the
leg of someone. However, there is no systematic contrast between alienable
and inalienable possession involving the respective absence or presence of the
prefix e-. In case the empty root would once have had its origin in inalienability
phenomena as in Tupi languages (e.g. Gavião in Moore 1984:146-152 and
Mekens in Galucio 2001:32-33), no such distinction belongs to the grammar of
Kwaza today. The empty root strongly resembles the Kanoê prefix i-, both in
form, function and distribution. This prefix is provisionally analysed in Bacelar
(2004) as an element to express inalienability, but there are also alienable items
where it occurs and inalienable items where it does not occur.
A practically identical root ƭ- is mentioned for Latundê (Northern Nambikwara) in Telles (2002a:96) where it is analysed as a semantically empty root
that lends independent nominal status to bound classifier morphemes in the
very same way. The empty root is also strikingly similar in form and use to the
prefix e- in Tacanan languages, such as Ese Eja (Chavarría 2000) and Cavineña4.2. Class137(Guillaume 2004) where it occurs in the same position with the same function.
The empty root may be an areal trait (see van der Voort fcb). It is absent in Aikanã.
On a synchronic level, and unlike the other languages of the region, the
empty root e- can be associated with the verb root e- ‘to have’ in Kwaza. There
is a parallel with the word-formative empty root a- in Kwaza to which directional morphemes can be attached in order to form adverbs. That root can be
associated with the verb root a- ‘to have’ (see 6.2.1.). I have seen no equivalents of this in other languages, even though there are also directionals in Kanoê.
4.2.2. The types of classifiers
The morphemes illustrated above appear to behave like classifiers, but are they
truly classifiers? The answer to this question is important for the assessment of
the nature of Kwaza morphology. Many Kwaza classifiers behave as if they
were the second element in a compound, which is otherwise practically only
attested with Kwaza verbs. In other constructions, the behaviour of classifiers
shows resemblance to incorporation. In order to determine whether some essential differences emerge, I have roughly ordered the morphemes I consider to
be classifiers into sections according to their etymology.
In the very first subsection (4.2.2.1.) I discuss the use of the nominaliser -hͿ
as a neutral classifier. The following three subsections contain an inventory of
all known specific classifiers. In section (4.2.2.2.) I listed the classifiers which
have no fully transparent etymological relation to the nouns they classify. In
the next section (4.2.2.3.) I listed those which seem to be only slightly adapted
or reduced versions of the independent nouns with which they are referentially
identical. The final section (4.2.2.4.) lists those classifiers which can only appear as an independent noun when attached to the empty root e-.
4.2.2.1. The nominaliser -hͿ- as a neutral classifier
The element -hͿ- has many functions, which are probably related to its semantically zero, or “neutral” nature as a classifier. As was illustrated above, it may
have a nominalising effect, and it can be replaced by a specific classifier:
(323) aky'nͿ-day-hͿ
friend-1S-NOM
‘(my) friend’(324) aky'nͿ-xay-tay
friend-2S-CL:woman
‘your FEM friend’The neutral classifier may also have valency changing effects (see 5.4.9.).
These are probably the consequence of the process of incorporation of the classifier into certain verbs. In some cases, the neutral classifier can then be re1384. The noun phraseplaced with a specific classifier. Intransitive verbs like 'ha-ki ‘it is clean’ or
o'xote-ki ‘he is waiting’ can “incorporate” an object in the form of a classifier:
(325) ha-ha-'hͿ-ki
clean-clean-NOM-DEC
‘he washes things’(326) ha-ha-'ro-ki
clean-clean-CL:cup-DEC
‘he washes pans’(327) ônibus(*-wã) oxote-'hͿ-da-ki
wait-NOM-1S-DEC
bus(-AO)
‘I’m waiting for the bus’
The nominaliser -hͿ- may be used to form a clefted construction and thereby
create an intensified sense (see 5.5.20.) which results in comparatives and superlatives:
(328) nͿ-'ro-hͿ-ki
(*nͿro'hͿki)
big-CL:cup-NOM-DEC
‘the cup is bigger / biggest’
This looks like reduplication when the root contains -hͿ- as a neutral classifier:
(329) nͿ-hͿ-'hͿ-ki
big-NOM-NOM-DEC
‘it is bigger / it is the biggest’
Note, however, that the verb root nͿ- without a subsequent classifier means ‘to
be fat’. I regard -hͿ- as semi-lexicalised in the root nͿ-hͿ- ‘to be big’ because
this meaning is retained when -hͿ- is replaced by a specific classifier. There are
in fact many instances of (semi-)lexicalised or lexicalising neutral classifiers. A
more lexicalised example is ku'kui-ki ‘it hurts’ vs. kukui-'hͿ-ki ‘he is ill’. When
the neutral classifier is replaced with a specific classifier the original sense of
the stem returns and a corresponding specific illness has to be expressed in another way:
(330) kukui-ko'ko-ki
kukui-ko'ro-ki
kukui-'tõi-ki
kukui-mjã'ka-ki‘his throat (ekoko) hurts’
‘his arm (tsoro) hurts’
‘his eye (ecõi) hurts’
‘his belly (emjãka) hurts’4.2.2.2. Etymologically opaque classifiers
The following classifiers are at best etymologically only partially related to
certain specific independent nouns.","[173, 174, 175, 176]"

‘pounded rice’
The possibility of object marking in (197) is not understood, but its impossibility in (198) can probably be explained in relation to the fact that this phrase
represents an attributive construction. The object of the verb root is the head of
this attributive construction (see also 4.3.2. and 8.4.1.).
4.1.1.9. Concluding remarks
In conclusion, we can say that objects of transitive verbs tend to be case
marked in the first place because they belong to the animate category. When
they are inanimate, case marking is ungrammatical. From a formal point of
view, case marking is not strictly necessary in order to distinguish between the
subject and the object, because the subject is identified by cross-reference
marking on the verb. However, if all arguments are third persons there is room
for ambiguity. In the absence of case marking, if both subject and object are
animate third persons, there would be no way to know on the basis of the syntax alone which would be what. From a pragmatic point of view, the absence of
case marking generally does not create ambiguity when the verbal object is inanimate. The same holds for indirect objects of semantically ditransitive verbs:
it is usually people who give things to living beings. So, if the case marker -wã
were an animacy marker alone, the disambiguation function would be an automatic side effect. Nevertheless, it is essential when the arguments of transitive
verbs are equal in animacy and person. Therefore -wã is bifunctional: it serves
to mark both animacy and objecthood. At the same time, it reflects the much
attested pragmatically based tendency to prefer to give subject function to animate beings (see e.g. Comrie 1989:128). From the contrast between certain
verbs, remember the pair (106) and (107), it appears also that in the grammar of
Kwaza, human beings are higher on the animacy hierarchy than non-human
animate beings.
The occurrence of -wã on inanimate nouns, as in (197), is not understood in
the light of the present analysis.
For some verbs no information was obtained regarding the question whether
animate object marking is optional, obligatory or ungrammatical:

In combination with the element -a- and the nominaliser -hͿ, -wã may have
an adverbialising function. This is discussed in (6.2.4.3.).
4.1.2. Locative -na
The locative case ending -na, also pronounced often as [nã], basically expresses the sense of ‘in’. It is also used as a general marker expressing other locational senses as ‘into, under, from, etc.’, often in combination with verbs
bearing a directional suffix (see 5.3.).

As will be seen in (4.1.3.), the locative can also be expressed by the instrumental ending -ko.
In some instances a locative or instrumental object is already understood
from the pragmatic context or from the semantic content of the verb, in which
case it is not considered acceptable to add one:
(217) (*? xui-'na / xui-'ko) atxitxi
bag-LOC / bag-INS maize

(218) tsǊhǊ-rati-'na
what-FOC-LOC
‘in what?’
Only nouns which function as locative adverbs may occur without locative or
instrumental case marking. Such nouns often bear the classifier/directional -rjͿ
‘area’ (see 4.2. and 6.2.3.).
4.1.3. Instrumental -ko
The ending -ko marks the noun as an instrumental argument of the verb.

(221) ho'ho-Ϳ-mǊ-'ko
ha'je-wa-ki

Instrumental -ko can also be omitted. One would expect that arguments
without instrumental or locative case marking are nuclear arguments instead of4.1. Case123local arguments. With some verbs the omission of -ko may indicate an alternative valency interpretation:
(222) mƭu-(ko)
nǊ'ri-da-ki
chicha-INS satiate-1S-DEC
‘I’m full of chicha’
Because verbs are often not morphologically marked for transitivity, it is not
certain that (222) is transitive when -ko is omitted. With respect to the arguments in the following examples my teacher explained that “they are more correct with -ko, but if you are lazy or you don’t feel like talking, you leave it
out”:
(223) awe-mǊ-(ko)
haha-nͿ-'djo-xa-re

(224) awe-mǊ-(ko)
haha-'djo-hata-ni
rain-CL:liquid-INS wash-CL:foot-3S.2O-EXH
‘let the rainwater wash your foot!’
The consultant’s remark probably indicates that the omission of the case
marker does not reflect increase of the verb’s valency. Note the following ungrammatical example:
(225) *awe-mǊ
haha-ki
xyi-dy-hͿ
coha
rain-CL:liquid wash-DEC you-POS-NOM foot
‘the rainwater washes your foot’
The consultant explained that this sentence was incorrect because “the rain did
not place me here, in order to wash me”95. This remark indicates that the rain is
not considered a proper agentive argument of the verb.
Although grammatical omission of instrumental -ko does not necessarily
imply that the noun is a nuclear argument of the verb, it is not entirely optional
either. Omission of -ko does have an influence of the meaning of the sentence:
(226) awe-mǊ-'ko
toma-'ra
rain-CL:liquid-INS bathe-IMP
‘take a bath with rainwater (from the barrel)!’

has a connotation of desire, whereas the future is neutral in this respect.
In combination with procrastinative -tara- (see 5.5.19.1.), the volitive -mͿ is
not inflected for person. It has a kind of postponing exhortative sense, and its
perspective is either first person singular subject, or, not surprising from a semantic point of view, first person inclusive subject. In the examples below, it is
something else which will be postponed on behalf of the state of affairs as expressed by the verb root.

Through ellipsis of a verbal root the first person singular form of the volitive
may occur as a volitional paricle da'mͿ ‘I will’, ‘yes!’ insofar as the context
allows. It has a connotation of eagerness and its use may make a covetous impression in certain contexts. For example as a minimal response to an invitation
to drink coffee da'mͿ is regarded as not very nice. Then again, it is a proper response to a command.
Such ellipsis has probably led to the emergence of an auxiliary-like independent verbal root with the meaning ‘to be intending/wanting/going to (do)’,
which is marked for any person like any other verb root:

reported speech construction (see 5.5.11.) where person and mood inflexions
are cliticised to already existing person and mood inflexion. In the case of the
volitive this cliticisation again has led to the emergence of -damͿ- ‘is going to’,

and periods might be inserted. This was also done together with Mario.
A traditional Kwaza story consists often of several or one long chain of cosubordinated clauses. In the strictest interpretation of this view, the entire story
consists of one long sentence only. Because it would be somewhat cumbersome
for the reader to find the free translations only at the very end of the story, I
have tried to cut it up into natural segments, and inserted the corresponding free
translations between these. In part I of the present story, the three periods at the
end of certain English free translations indicate that the corresponding Kwaza
469.The traditional initiation of boys includes these ingredients. Only a few people in
the A.I. Tubarão-Latundê are old enough to have undergone initiation. Some aspects of it, however, such as the thrashing with pacova stems, are sometimes performed at festivities.","[803, 804]"
"6788. Subordination and coordination8.3.2.1.5. Discourse particles and discontinuity
In (8.3.1.9.) it was shown how cosubordinative markers are sometimes used as
particles. The same seems to be possible with different third person subjects:

‘“that isn’t you, no way, you have hidden someone” she said to her, “whom
did I hide?, I didn’t” she said, well, “you’re lying, get him out of there!, I
will kill him and devour him”’ (t)
The examples show how the combined different subject and cosubordinative
markers behave as if they were a free morpheme. In the proper context, the
element (hͿ)dyta is interpreted as a discourse particle with the approximated
senses of ‘well, while, as, when, then’. Grammatically, it remains an instrument
to express switch reference, but it has also a connotation of counterexpectation, surprise or suspicion:
(3583)(3584)dy-'tazjwãu

‘Samuel is arriving, and João too’
H: zjwãu-'e
João-too
‘João too?’S: zjwãu-dy-'ta
João-DS-CSO
‘(yes, remarkably) João too’Hence, it appears that the morpheme combination -dy-ta does not only express
discontinuity of third person subjects across a complex sentence, but it may8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses679also communicate an interruption of what would be expected. On somewhat
rarer occasions it was attested how -dy-ta, besides functioning as a switch reference marker, was associated with termination of the event expressed by the
verb:
(3585)barİ-dy-'mǊ-dy-ta
(3586)
heat-CAU-CL:liquid-DS-CSO
‘he finished heating up the water’ (t)wara'ñͿ-dy-ta
work-DS-CSO
‘he finished working’So the element -dy- is used to express discontinuity in a more general sense as
well.
For a general discussion of the use of bound inflexional cosubordinative
mood markers as free resumptive particles, see (7.5.2.2.). For similar phenomena involving the switch-reference mood, see (8.3.2.3.1.).
8.3.2.2. Indefinite different subject: -dwaThe morpheme -dwa- is a variant of the indefinite subject cross-reference
marker -wa- (see 5.1.4.1.). It occurs only in the medial clause and it co-refers
with the indefinite subject of the next clause. It does not agree with the subject
of the present clause, but it indicates that the subject of the next clause is indefinite, and that it is different from the subject of the present clause. Here are
some examples from texts by different narrators:

When a clause which contains -dwa- is translated in isolation, the morpheme
may have an inchoative effect. Compare the following example to the subsequent ones:
(3595)hade'ja-cwa-ta
night-IS-CSO
‘it is being night’(3597)haja-'nã-(hͿ)-dwa-ta
day-FUT-NOM-IDS-CSO
‘it is starting to dawn’(3596)si'le-dwa-ta

‘it is being/becoming dusk’8.3.2.3. Switch reference mood: -si
The verb-root extension -dy- as discussed in (8.3.2.1.) is used to mark third
person switch reference. The next question is: how to indicate switch reference
with other persons? As explained above, the subject of a medial clause ending
in -ta is usually identical to the subject of the matrix clause. Because subject
identity finds expression in overt and covert coreferent person marking, one
would expect that non-coreferent person marking would suffice to indicate different subjects. However, things are not as straightforward as that. The proper
way to mark switch reference between non-third person subjects involves two
morphological operations. In the first place, there is overt non-coreferent person subject marking. In the second place the medial clause ending -ta is re6828. Subordination and coordinationplaced by another medial clause ending -si. The element -si indicates that the
subject of the subsequent verb is different from that of the current verb. The
contrast between the following examples illustrates its use:
(3598)'kwİ-da-ta
atxitxi-'nǊ
'ja-da-ki
enter-1S-CSO maize-CL:powder eat-1S-DEC
‘I entered and ate maize porridge’(3599)'kwİ-da-si
ho'Bİto atxitxi-'nǊ
wa'dy-ta-ki
enter-1S-SWR Roberto maize-CL:powder give-1O-DEC
‘I entered and Roberto gave me maize porridge’The hypothesis that -si indicates a switching referent explains why *kwİ-da-si
atxitxi-nǊ ja-da-ki, cf. example (3598), was considered uninterpretable by the
consultant.
There is no functional difference between the switch reference markers -dyand -si. The consultant claimed that they meant the same thing, which is corroborated by the contrast between (3563) and (3600), and by (3601):
(3600)(si) 'kwİ-da-si
mau'risiju wa'dy-ki

‘he returned, I went there’txi?a-'wã
Txi?a-AOIn the above examples, the subordinated verb and the matrix verb express two
successive events. Verbs in the switch reference mood can also function as
complement clauses of perception verbs:390

consequences for the meaning of the following sentences (see 8.4.).","[715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720]"
