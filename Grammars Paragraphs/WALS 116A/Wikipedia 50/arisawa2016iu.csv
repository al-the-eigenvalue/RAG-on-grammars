particle /saːɁ˧˩/ (saah/saaqh) and a certain tag-question with the
final particle /ɔɁ˧˩/ (orqc) expecting a positive answer. Note,
however, that in the ‘Unified (Roman-based) Script’ of Iu Mien,
the regular question mark /?/ is used for both questions with rising

QUESTIONS
IntroductionThere are three kinds of questions: (i) the polar question using the sentencefinal particle fai, (ii) the polar question that is indicated by a falling intonation, and
(iii) the content question using interrogative words. Since the second kind was
presented in §§3.3.4.3–4, this chapter will show only one instance of that type.","[699, 700]"
"Given the vocabulary and conversational sentences written in Thai script, Arisawa
(2011c) has investigated the transfer value of Chop-Kacha’anat’s writing system byasking two questions: (a) Does the writing system help Iu Mien children to read andwrite Standard Thai?, and (b) If an adult Mien who is already literate in Thai picks up
an Iu Mien book written in this writing system, how easy is it for him/her to read andunderstand it using Thai alphabet’s rules? The answer to the first question was “yes”;
it teaches them Thai system, not Iu Mien. The answer to the second question was as
follows:
Iu Mien who learn how to read and write Iu Mien by this Yao Conversation Lesson
will lose 20 % of consonant phonemes,58
will lose 30 % of tone,will have to cope with irregular spellings and lose many contrastive features in
words,will be reminded of making preglottalised nasals distinct
Nonetheless, it is not for Iu Mien to learn literacy but for the Thai officials “tounderstand them” (การเข้าใจของชาวเขา) for their welfare.",[118]
"3.3.4.2 Keeping the original tone of question word haaixSimilarly to the description of /haːi˨˧/ above, content questions ending withthe interrogative word /haːi˨˧/ (haaix) ‘what, where’ keep its underlying tone. In a
question /miŋ˧˩ haːi˨˧/ (Mingh haaix?) [go where] ‘Where are you going?’, the pitch atthe end of the word /haːi˨˧/ ‘where’ (Tone 5 /˨˧/) ends with the approximately same
height of the first word /miŋ˧˩/ ‘go’ (Tone 2 /˧˩/) (137.6Hz) as in Figure 39.",[221]
"253Some questions, other than Wh-questions, are also expressed by particles
placed at the end of a sentence. For example, Longx nyei fai?⤴ [be.well STATIVE.ASPECT
INTERROGATIVE] ‘Are you well?’ (an English approximate of “How are you?”) or Longxnyei saah¿⤵ [be.well STATIVE.ASPECT INTERROGATIVE] ‘You are fine, aren’t you?’ These

"It is also important to note that the real language is situated in discourse andpragmatic contexts of life. In a connected discourse, be it monologue or
conversational, once the topic is established between the interlocutors, i.e.,
contextually accessible, a pronoun referring to it is most likely omitted; a THEMEargument retrievable from context also undergoes ellipsis. Thus Iu Mien is a contextdependent language. It also heavily utilises varieties of sentence-final particles in
interlocution, indicating content question, polar question, self-question, aspects,
politeness or firmness, mild or strong command, urging, surprise, irritation, hearsay,
and doubt or certainty.",[40]
Interrogative SFPsThe polar question is indicated by the sentence final particle fai in a risingintonation as in (892)(cf. (131) in §3.3.4.3):(892)Meihkoijienvnyei↗fai?,[700]

Besides the normal question final particle fai, there are also other SFPs thatconvey various nuances. One of them is a self-doubt particle mborqc with a falling

The rapport-taking SFP orqc also has a connotation of asking a question butnot for requesting new information. It seeks to confirm that the interaction between
the interlocutors is intact as exemplified in (1044)(a repetition of (14-2)):784(1044)Ninhmbuomvmaaihmienv(14 )นิ่นบัวม้ม่ายเมี้ยนorqc¿

"Debating between the two sharply contrasted functions of proper names,namely the referring function (after Mill) and the describing function (after Frege),
Searle announces his stance that it is “a sort of compromise between Mill and Frege”
as follows:My answer, then, to the question, ‘Do proper names have senses?’ —if this
asks whether or not proper names are used to describe or specify
characteristics of objects— is ‘No’. But if it asks whether or not proper
names are logically connected with characteristics of the object to which
they refer, the answer is ‘Yes, in a loose sense of way’ (Searle 1971:139).
Thus Searle concludes that proper names “function not as descriptions, but as pegs on
which to hang descriptions” (ibid. 140) as quoted earlier. Obviously, his emphasis is
on the referring function: “[…] the essential fact to keep in mind when dealing withthese problems is that we have the institution of proper names to perform the speechact of identifying reference” (ibid. 141) albeit maintaining the interaction of the two.
Onomastics of the Iu Mien, however, will reveal that their names are bothhighly descriptive and referential. The situation is not that “either-or” nor “loosely
descriptive but more referential”. §5.3 discusses the descriptive, predicative functionof proper names, and §5.4 considers speech act by using proper names, i.e., referring
function; more spesifically vocative particles postpositioned to proper names and
nomination (act of naming).",[296]

"18.2.4 Disjunctive Coordination, fai ‘or’The third construction in coordinating clauses is disjunctive coordination. The“yes-no” interrogative is expressed by the sentence final question particle fai with asharp rising intonation. However, when the question particle fai is used in the middleof two clauses, the reading is ‘or’. In the latter case, fai is pronounced with its original
tone, i.e., mid-level tone. The pattern of coordination is:
