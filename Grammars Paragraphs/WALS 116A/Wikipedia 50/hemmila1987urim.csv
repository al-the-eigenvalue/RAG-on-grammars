"Strong reason: eng nteiThe basic meaning of eng ntei is interrogative ‘why?’; its use to mark strong reasons is secondary.
Strong reason means here, that the speaker feels an extra need of explanation (answers to a question
etc.), or wants to emphasize the reason. The expression eng ntei in this use is not very common in
texts - all examples below are elicited. Its function is much the same as an ordinary rhetoric question,
which the speaker himself answers. Its use probably reflects the influence of Tok Pisin bilong
wanem.

"NegationThere are two basic negators in Urim: ake ‘not’ (for verbal clauses) and kalpis (for non-verbal
clauses) (=Kukwo dialect kalpm) ‘no’. Instead of kalpis the more injection-like a’a can also be used.
The verbal negator ake can occur either immediately before or after the subject (more usual in
texts), but if the subject is prominent and therefore fronted, then ake always occurs between it and the
verb. Ake is also used in verbless equative and descriptive clauses.

Kalpis is used to negate non-verbal existence and possessive clauses, occurring at the end of the
clause. It frequently takes the attributive suffix -en. Kalpis (or sometimes a’a) is also used to answer
yes/no questions and at the end of the clause to strengthen the ake negation of the clause.

1sgNon-serialized clauses conjoined without any overt conjunctionIt is quite common in Urim to simply juxtapose coordinated, non-serialized clauses without any
overt conjunction. Juxtaposed, non-serialized clauses are distinguished from verb serialization
constructions by intonation. Pauses usually occur between coordinated clauses, never in
serializations. Often there is rising intonation on the last word of each non-final coordinated clause,
especially in lists. In lists, juxtaposition of the conjuncts is the norm:
Tu
kai nangnang, howen nim, antokg kweikwei
kol-pa, tu atopen.
3pl go singsing beat drum do.R
things
like-that 3pl rejoice.R
‘They go to singsings, beat drums, do things like that, they get joy (from those things)’
When a second clause/sentence is a paraphrase of the first, it is typically just juxtaposed.

Ari is the most common contrastive conjunction. Its function is to mark contrast or
contraexpectation. Typically there is an unexpected event or sudden (especially negative) surprise,
sometimes just some new turn of story. Sometimes ari just marks the change of actor or speaker in
discussion, especially if the speaker answers negatively or otherwise against expectations.

negative nature of the surprising event. The combination ari kalpis is commonly used in narrative
texts to indicate a turning point of a story.

‘They wanted to buy a car but it is too expensive.’
Ari seems to be used more often when the clause expresses some new incident that hinders the
plan, while pake is used more often when the hindering element already exists or is known (like the
price of a car). This is just a tendency, not a rule. The uses of these conjunctions seem to overlap at
least partly.
This far it seems that only pake occurs in following cases:
1) When the two clauses express contrastive comparison, either in quantity or in quality or on
positive-negative.

‘This car will take you to the village, but you must tell the driver first’3) The word pake also functions an emphatic particle having scope over either the whole
sentence or particular noun phrases. In the available corpus of texts, the emphatic particle function of
pake is much more common than its conjunctive function. Emphatic pake is especially common in
narrative texts and conversations, while the conjunction pake is comparatively rare in narrative text.
When pake has scope over the whole sentence, it usually occurs last in the sentence, and therefore is
not easily confused with the conjunction pake.","[209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215]"
"4.7. Typological Considerations
In summary, some clear tendencies can be seen. First, SVO word order occurs in all clause types.
Urim is a very consistent and rigid SVO-language. In particular, the position of subject is very fixed.
In most clause types it cannot be moved after the verb or anywhere else. In certain intransitive
clauses this is possible, but not very common. Also the position of locative object and topic is quite
rigid. In transitive clauses the second argument, object, is easily fronted for thematic reasons. There
is not so much danger of mixing the grammatical functions of subject and object in transitive clause,
because the transitive subject always is the more animate and agent-like referent in the clause. As
we have seen, the transitive subject is almost exclusively agent, and if not, this is shown by the
structure of the clause.
Typologically it is a common phenomenon that rigid word order and lack of morphological case
markings occur together in a language. This is especially common in SVO-languages like Urim.
Urim does not have any case marking morphology on either the subject or object, nor is there any
agreement marked on the verb either. Since there is no morphological way to mark which noun
phrase in the clause is subject and which is object, the syntactic position of the noun phrase before or
after the verb is what shows its syntactic function. Not only the subject and transitive object are
unmarked, but also all other obligatory arguments of a verb are morphologically unmarked. This
increases the importance of word order for delineating the functions of NPs in the clause. The
following examples illustrate how a change of word order changes the meaning of clauses and even
the clause type:

(26b)Melnumalm -pel(experience clause)
nikg170
manhit.R-3sg.Ostomach‘The man hit him in the stomach.’(transitive clause)Urim has been classified as a Papuan language, stock level isolate in the Torricelli Phylum.. The
question of isolation can be re-considered when some of the neighbouring languages have been
studied in more detail. All Torricelli languages display some similarities with Austronesian
languages: fixed SVO word order, lack of medial verbs, use of transitivity-changing suffixes and
realis-irrealis mood, etc. It seems that Urim has these non-Papuan features to a greater extent than
many other Torricelli languages. It lacks subject-agreement on the verb, and is also in other respects
morphologically simpler than the other Torricelli phylum languages.
Torricelli phylum languages have been thought to be basically Papuan languages which have been
subjected to heavy Austronesian influence. There are some Austronesian languages along the north
coast. Word order is one of the Austronesian features in the Torricelli language group, since Papuan
languages usually are SOV- languages. It is a common theory that SVO- languages often have
developed from earlier SOV-languages either through the influence of some neighbouring SOVlanguages or from language internal reasons. One of these reasons could be the disappearance of
morphological case-marking, which in a way forces the language to rely on the word order in marking
these functions. (Givón 1979a 145-146). If a language were to change its word order from SOV to
SVO, it would be expected that there would be some residues from the former SOV-type structure.
The more recent this change has been, the more residues would be expected. Word order change
most commonly starts from the main-clause level, and later spreads into more complex structures.
According to Givón (1984:220-228). “the longer a language has maintained a rigid OV or VO word
order, the more it is likely to bear out Greenberg’s predictions (1966).” If this is true, then Urim has
been SVO-language at least during the last two thousand years, since it is an unusually pure SVOlanguage following all the predictions that Greenberg mentions. All modifiers of the noun phrase and
almost the entire verb phrase occur after the head. There are suffixes, but this is quite a common
feature in SVO-languages in general, and not a strong indicator of a recent change of word order.
Most commonly the residue of the presumed word order would occur in dependent and embedded
clauses and other structures like nominalizations and idioms. But in Urim these have SVO-word
order, except when the subject referent is generic:
(27)Kil
ariwe
hapm
3sg
know.R cloth
‘She knows how to sew.’angkut.
sew.RThis is the only observed possible residue of a former SOV-word order. Assuming this theory is
right Urim is an almost ideal SVO-language typologically. One could perhaps question if it were
easier to derive a language like Urim from an Austronesian group having some heavy Papuan171
influences than the other way around? But this and the whole question of the classification of Urim
needs much more work before any definite answers or even suggestions can be given.","[169, 170, 171]"
"99
Another possible connection exists between ai and the interrogative pronoun ahi. The phonetic
form of the interrogative pronoun can be derived from the word ai by adding rising question
intonation. As the result of rising intonation the second vowel /i/ lengthens. After that the word is resyllabified and /h/ is added between the vowels to mark the syllable break. Notice, that also the
demonstrative pronoun ai tends to have indefinite meaning.

that10 In the expressions ahi and kolai there is a clear syllable boundary heard between the vowels /a/ and /i/.
Intonationally, the /a/ often has a higher pitch than what precedes it and it is followed by a rise on the /i/ starting lower
than the /a/.",[48]
"Clauses Predicating ExistenceAnother subtype of intransitive clause, the existence clause, is also common in the texts. It
usually takes the same sort of posture verbs as the locative clause as predicates, but does not have any
locative object. Another difference from locative clauses (described in the section 6.4.2) is that the
negative form of existence clause is always verbless, and it is possible to omit the verb in some
positive existence clauses as well. Verbal clauses are negated using the verbal negative particle ake
(see example 7d), but in a negated existence clause the nominal negative word kalpis is used instead,
and the verb is missing.(7a)(7b)(7c)(7d)Men

only(Here the first clause is negative and verbless. Second clause has werpm as subject and rmpa as
predicate.)The existence clause often has the same thematic functions as certain left dislocations in Urim and
the existential clause in English; it is used to introduce new items to the text. This explains also why
the subject in this clause type can move so easily after the verb. The position after the verb is
universally the place of new information in the clause, and in existential clauses the subject usually is158
new information, while in other clause types it is usually given information. The following examples
illustrate how existence clauses and left dislocation are used the same way to introduce main
participants at the beginning of a text. They also show how difficult it is sometimes to tell the
difference between left dislocation and existence clause.

DAbout the uses of pa occurring before pause
Most Urim conjunctions can occur in two phonological positions, either before a pause
intervening between two clauses or after it. When a conjunction occurs before the pause, it is always
pronounced with a distinctive rising intonation, and often its final vowel, or syllable (also the final
nasal can be lengthened!) is lengthened as well. The placing of a conjunction before pause does not
basically change its meaning, but makes it more emphatic, for example expressing surprise. Quite
often prepausal pa is subordinating, with the potential for being interpreted as ‘when’, ‘because’, or
‘if’. In Urim pa conjunction occurring before a pause can have a causative, conditional, or temporal226
interpretation. Possibly there is no clear-cut difference between causatives and conditionals in Urim,
as far as the use of pa goes. When the speaker wants to express that the reason etc. is uncertain or
hypothetical, he adds irrealis mood and/or the particle kol to the clause.
Conditional clauses are clauses whose semantic role is the expression of hypotheses or conditions
(Crystal 1980). There are some similarities between topics and conditionals. In many languages both
may be marked by similar morphemes. This is also true in Urim - one of the main functions of pa is
to mark topicalized constituents.
The conjunction pipa is more common in conditional constructions than pa, especially in written
texts (see section 5. 5. 6. 4).
Examples:
Also a presuppositional pa occurring before the pause can be used purely in the meaning ‘when’
or ‘then’ - without any kind of clear causativity, like in the following examples:

When pa occurs before a pause following a clause with irrealis mode, the combination typically
functions as a conditional protasis:

‘When they are encircling a pig, women are not allowed to go near.’Near demonstrative ti as conjunction indicating a response to something which is
happening/being said or has just happened/been said
Ti is basically a demonstrative indicating proximity: ‘this’, ‘here’. As a conjunction, it is used to
link clauses exhibiting a causal relationship. Often ti preserves it’s meaning of proximity when used
as conjunction, indicating that something which has just happened is the reason for something else
happening.
The conjunction ti tends to occur instead of pa in spoken conversations and direct quotations
when clauses exhibit a reason-result relationship..It does not have the other functions that the
conjunction pa has. So it is not used to mark temporal relationships, neutral/logical coordination, or
conditions.

considered to be a fact. Consequently the verb in the result clause is usually has realis mode. All the
following examples are from conversations, expressing reactions to present situations or
explanations/answers in response to questions. The conjunction ti refers to something that has just
been said or has just happened, or to a present condition:

All the examples presented in this section clearly show that the near demonstrative ti is used as

speaker wants to point to a context or comment that is temporarily or spatially near.","[225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230]"
"PluralityTwo pragmatic factors seem to govern the use of the pronoun tu to mark plurality. It is not used if
the group of people referred to constitutes new information, is generic in reference, is non-topical, or
plurality is sufficiently clear from context or numerals:37

also used with inherently plural nouns, which do not need any additional markers for plurality:

(mamikg mayen + mamiin wror)
(kiin+kipman ‘woman-man’)(yikal-ik ‘bow-arrow’)There are two other ways to mark plurality in nouns: the word kweikwei ‘things’ and
reduplication. The word kweikwei is used to mark the plurality of non-human nouns, usually when
the group of entities is indefinite. Reduplication can be used both with human and non-human nouns.
Also modifiers can be pluralized by reduplication - sometimes the plurality of noun phrase is
expressed only by reduplicating the modifier.

The indefinite quantifier ur is a good example of a word that has several word class functions. It
resembles indefinite articles occurring on many languages, and like these, is clearly related to the
numeral uris ‘one’. In Urim, the numeral uris morphologically looks like a attributive form of ur
(ur-is ‘ATR’).
The most common and probably basic function of ur is to mark indefiniteness ‘a, one’ (in
negative clauses ‘any’). Ur is commonly used to introduce new referents to the text, but not every
time. Ur is used in the following cases:
- when it is important to know the number of referents introduced, but the context or other
modifiers do not tell it. For this reason ur is almost always used when persons are introduced. Often
it can be glossed ‘one’ like the numeral uris, but the numeral does not have the function of
introducing new referents. Even if the numeral occurs, ur is still required to show that a new referent
is being introduced (see the first example below).

There are four demonstratives. Each of these can have both referential and psychological uses.
All can also be used to refer to time and as parts of pro-adverbs. The basic deictic functions of these
demonstratives are as follows:
ti
pa
aikil‘this, here’ indicates physical nearness to the speaker, to the hearer, or to both. It can also
indicate psychological nearness to the speaker.
‘that, there’ indicates a referent that is some distance away from the speaker, the hearer, or both.
The referent is usually near enough to be seen. Pa can also signal an indefinite distance.
‘far away, over there, somewhere’ is phonetically a clitic, but native speakers usually write it
separately. Ai indicates that a referent is relatively far away from both the speaker and hearer.
The referent is usually not near enough to be seen. Ai also often indicates an indefinite spatial
or temporal distance.
‘3sg; this, here’ marks physical or psychological nearness and is sometimes used instead of ti
when referring to humans or animals, or when the proximity of a referent is emphasized. Kil is
basically a third person singular pronoun with its use as demonstrative pronoun being secondary
(see section 2.4).","[84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]"
"Introducing new participants and referents to discourseIn Urim new participants and referents are introduced by various means: full NP, full NP plus
relative clause, full NP plus indefinite ur, full NP plus the demonstrative pa, full NP plus a
combination of ur and pa. In addition, there are also special clause and phrase types, which are used
for introducing new participants.
New items that are not topical, are usually introduced by a full noun phrase, with or without the
indefinite quantifier ur. Ur is not used if it is clear from the context that there can be only one
referent:

There are different ways to introduce topical new referents. Left dislocations and special
presentative constructions are used. This is especially the case at the beginning of texts, but also
happens sometimes at the beginning of a new paragraph.. When new main participants are introduced
in a narrative text, very often the combination of ur pa is used (with or without left dislocation). Here
the indefinite ur expresses that the participant is new information, while the demonstrative pa marks
the referent of the NP as topical. If the identity of the new participant is further specified by a
relative clause, pa is not used:

demonstratives , regardless of whether or not they are topical. When the introduced participants are
inherently definite NPs like pronouns or proper nouns, the beginning of a story is often marked by
adding pa or ur pa to a sentence-initial time adverbial.

If the new participant or other topic is introduced using special presentative clauses like the
following, no deictic particles are used:

In the last example the theme or name of this traditional story is mentioned in the presentative
clause, and the main actor is marked as topical via use of ur pa.
New important participants can also be introduced by using just pa. This commonly happens in
traditional narratives, where the participants are already familiar to the hearers:

personIn case the new referents are not topical, i.e. they will not be recurringly referred to in the text,
they are often modified by an embedded locative clause when first introduced, as in the following two
examples.

go upThere is universal tendency in languages to avoid having new information introduced into the text
in Subject position (Givon 1979a :72-74). In Urim, however, it is possible to have Subjects introducing new information, but often left-dislocations, existence clauses or topic structures are used to
avoid this. Only topical, important items are introduced to the text in subject position. Less important
items are usually introduced in the typical position of new information after the verb. In Urim this NP
introducing new information quite often has an embedded locative clause as a constituent. Some of
these are lexicalized into deictic adverbials, like the expression ha-pa in the examples above.","[247, 248, 249]"
"NegationNegation is usually considered part of verb phrase. In Urim the verbal negator ake normally
occurs immediately before the verb (or serial verb phrase), but is often also placed first in the clause,
especially in answers:

Akentive can be interpreted as a idiomatized phrase (ake antive ‘not enough/able’). All these
expressions are more like clause adverbs than parts of verb phrase.

DTime wordsSince Urim verbs have no tense morphology indicating time of occurrence, time is expressed with
time adverbs. These have been described earlier in the Section 2.7.1. In Urim, these words occur in
the clause independently of the verb, except perhaps the non-deictic sequencing adverbials hep ‘first,
ahead’ and katnukg ‘later, behind’: and the time adverb wet ‘now, recently, a short time ago’. These
are usually placed immediately before the main verb (or serials).","[146, 147]"

homophonous with the genitive and relative marker a, but is not the same lexeme. Examples:

Listing is usually done without any overt connecting conjunction. Also when there are multiple
coordinated modifiers of the head noun/noun complex with the noun phrase, no connectives conjoin
the modifiers:

‘Yams, mami-yams, [and] sweet potatoes’

When speaking about several people using their names, no conjunction usually occurs. Instead a
suitable personal pronoun occurs either before or after the names. The dual pronoun tuwekg ‘they144
two’ is usually reduced into (w)ekg ‘ two’. This pronoun can occur before, between, or after the two
NPs. When the connecting pronoun occurs before, the structure looks more like an appositional
construction :

CAccompaniment linking
The verbs nampokgen ‘together with’ and anti ‘with’ are used when coordinative relation
between NPs has the additive meaning of accompaniment. These words could perhaps also be
interpreted as prepositions, especially since nampokgen does not occur as predicate. Both still exhibit
an irrealis form. Anti seems to occur only with human NPs, nampokgen can occur also with nonhuman NPs although it normally is used about humans. These conjunctions never occur between
clauses.

Some phrases are formed by adding the suffix –en to the modifier. The function of this suffix is
to mark the construction as a phrase, and it also has the semantical meaning ‘with’ (see also section
4.5.2.2). These phrases often function as adverbials in the sentence :

PERFDisjunctive nominal phrases

in questions. Here we only present some examples of it conjoining noun phrases. Other uses of aki
are described later in the section 5.5.3.

or3.4. What is Verb Phrase in Urim?
The term verb phrase is used in two senses. ‘Traditionally, it refers to a group of verbs which
together have the same syntactic function as a single verb (is coming, may be coming, get up to). In
such phrases, one verb is the main verb and the others are subordinate to it. In generative grammar,
the verb phrase has a much broader definition, being equivalent to the whole of the predicate of a
sentence’ (Crystal pp.325-326).
In this grammar the different types of predicates will be described later in the Chapter 4 ‘Urim
Basic Clause Types’. If we follow the traditional definition of verb phrase, most serial phrases do fit
the definition, but not all of them. Many serial verb phrases function syntactically as prepositions.
Negation and some modality could possibly be described as part of verb phrase, but the scope of most
modal particles is rather the whole clause or sentence than verb phrase. Therefore it might be better to
leave the whole term ‘verb phrase’ out of Urim grammar.. Serial structures have already been
described in the sections 3.2.7 and 3.3.6. The grammatical functions commonly expressed in
languages within verb phrases, like negation, modality and time, have been partly described earlier
(3.2.2.) but we will shortly discuss them here too.","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"

enough to explain the changes. Often the ordering of rules is not essential, but in some cases it is
crucial that the one rule be applied before the others:

possible orders of rules:

"The Personal Pronoun kil as DemonstrativeThe third person pronoun kil funtions sometimes as near demonstrative substitute for ti. It is used
especially often when referring to humans, but can also refer to non-human entities (see also the
section 2. 4. 1. 1). Sometimes kil seems to be used to mark even closer proximity than ti, like in the
first example below:

Functions
As a demonstrative ai refers to entities that are even further away than those referred to with pa
and seems in this respect to belong to the same set as ti and pa. The referent is far from both speaker
and hearer and is usually not visible. Ai functions as a modifier within the noun phrase, as a locative
adverb, and as a demonstrative pronoun.

In some cases ai refers more to the direction than to the actual location of the referent and is
therefore frequently used with verbs expressing movement. As direction marker ai can also have the
meaning ‘till, as far as’:

Syntactically ai differs from other demonstratives (ti, pa, kil) in many important ways:
1) Ai seems to occur alone only when it functions as a locative adverbial adjunct. (This is
contrary to pa which can occur alone in Subject or Object position). Sometimes it occurs as Head in
time expressions as well, but this seems to be the result of ellipsis.

EMP2) Also when occurring with NP, ai usually modifies only those NPs that function as Locative
Adverbials or Locative Objects. It is also used in time adverbials. But if the NP has the role of
Subject or Object in the clause, locative marker ai usually modifies it with the help of a relative
clause. Some exceptions do occur (see the last example):

3) Ai is commonly used with time adverbials referring to the length of time while the word pa
occurs with time adverbials only as a thematic particle. The near demonstrative ti ‘this,here’ and kil
‘he,this’ instead can be used demonstratively also in time expressions.

4) Sometimes ai is used almost like a derivative suffix forming adverbials from adjectives:97

‘before, (sometimes)earlier’
pikekg tak ai
‘long ago’
pikekg taktak ai
‘very long ago’
pikekg tak ur ai
‘sometimes long ago’
ikg ai
‘sometimes later’
5) The demonstrative ai does not have same thematic functions than ti and pa. It is never used to
mark topicality, emphasis or focus. Occasionally ai is used to replace pa as mark of anaphoric
reference if the speaker wants to refer to the distance or direction of the referent.

Dmentekg rpma

1dual
sit.R

‘We have it in the house covered with a pot .. we sit in that house ..’
6) Ai never functions as a conjunction like pa and ti.
Sometimes ai is used as an alternative for pa to mark general remoteness in contrast with the
near demonstrative ti. This happens because in certain contexts pa would be always interpreted as a
discourse marker. For example when pa occurs after the indefinite quantifier ur, the combination ur
pa indicates the introduction of a new topic to the discourse.
When occurring together with indefinite pronoun ur, ai usually also has the meaning of
indefiniteness; it refers either to indefinite amount or to the indefiniteness of the referent itself.
Consider the following examples:
Uwi
hipm ur ai
kul!

‘Bring some leaves!’98

‘This certain man’ (introducing a new participant)Ai is used as far demonstrative instead of pa also with locative words like hen ‘inside’ or wompel
‘other side’. For example, the expression wan wunen pa could easily be interpreted as ‘in the
mentioned house’ or ‘inside the house’ (as contrast to outside) in discourse context:
Kil
kawor

‘Kawekg-leaves are (bound) inside (the arm), kiyom-leaves outside (upper part of the
arm)
Notice that in the last example ai and ti are clearly in contrast and the referent marked with ai is
not very distant spatially from that marked with ti.
Phonologically ai behaves like other clitics; it is pronounced together with previous word and is
usually unstressed. Native speakers generally write it as an independent word same way as other
clitics.","[94, 95, 96, 97, 98]"
"Temporal AdverbsTemporal adverbs and adverbials constitute a large and important subclass in Urim. Since Urim
verbs have no tense morphology indicating time of occurrence, temporal adverbials are especially
important. The deictic temporal adverbs form a system that distinguishes several degrees of
remoteness in the future and past.
The principal deictic temporal adverbs are listed below:
General Time ReferenceFormMeaningBefore Today - General Past

‘yesterday’Todaywuten, wet
weti (wet ti)

kwaikg
kiki
kwangil
kwalel
ikga‘tomorrow’
‘2 days from now’
‘3 days from now’
‘4 days from now’
‘5 days from now’
(Later Future)
(tomorrow or later)Note from the above forms in the list of deictic temporal adverbs that the system is somewhat
symmetrical around ‘now/today’. Pikekgkil ‘one day ago’ resembles the expression hikgkil ‘one
day from now’, and kwekekg ‘two days ago’ (< kwa+pikekg ‘above yesterday’) resembles the adverb
‘two days from now’ kwaikg (‘above tomorrow’).
In addition to the forms listed above the past temporal adverb pikekg can be modified in several
ways to indicate a more distant past. Some temporal adverbs (at least pikekg, kwekekg and hikg) can
also be modified by the distant deictic -ai. This makes the point of time even more indefinite:70pikekg (itna) hep

past -? -IDThe temporal adverb am ‘now’ expresses concurrent time. It usually occurs after the subject
immediately before the verb, but can occasionally occur before the subject, too. If there is pake or
tike at the end of the clause, their combined meaning is emphatic and could in many cases be
translated ‘it is --- that’, ‘it is ----- who’. (There is more about the uses of am in the section 5.5.5)

this-EMPIn addition to the deictic temporal adverbs, there are also non-deictic sequencing adverbial forms:
hep ‘first, ahead, in front of’ and katnukg ‘later, afterwards, behind’. This adverb exceptionally gets
realis-irrealis mode; irrealis form is kutnukg (In the Kukwo dialect and in western villages of the Urim
2 dialect the forms are kanukg and kunukg).
These non-deictic adverbials are possibly bi-categorial, functioning both as adverbs and verbs
(this would explain why katnukg gets realis-irrealis mode like verbs do). Consider the following
examples:71

The most common position of occurrence for temporal adverbs and adverbials is clause/sentence
initially. When temporal adverbs occur sentence initially, they can be followed by the deictic pronoun
pa, especially when there is contrast to some other point of time or when the temporal adverb or
adverbial starts a new chapter in the text.

Unfocused temporal adverbs usually occur following the subject and immediately before the verb.
Temporal adverbs can also occur after verb; this position is more focused.

Prepositions are defined as uninflected forms, which take a noun phrase complement and serve as
a mediating form between the noun phrase and the predicate, specifying its semantic role in the
predication. In Urim, there is only one ‘real’ preposition: eng.11 It is used to encode nearly all
oblique/peripheral arguments in the clause encoding a wide variety of semantic roles, including: 1)
Benefactive, 2) Recipient, 3) Locative Goal, 4) Purpose, 5) Reason, and 6) ‘about/concerning’. In
most cases eng appears to mark the referential domain with respect to which the predicate is true or
applicable. Perhaps this is its most basic meaning.
The form eng alternates with another, rarer form ekg. In the Kukwo dialect and in the western
villages of the Yangkolen dialect, this other form is more commonly used for these functions.","[49, 50]"

It will also be noted that all singular and second person forms begin with <k>; all non-singular
third person forms begin with tu-, and all non-singular first person forms begin with m (e,i)n-.
The pronouns may occur in the following clausal slots: 1) subject (or topic in topic clauses), 2)
non-topical first object, 3) second object, and 4) object of a preposition.

Subject referent is very generic or indefinite. Indefinite reference is sometimes also expressed by zero
anaphora, if some other NP is in the topic position in the clause. Third person singular indefinite
referents are also often expressed by using the noun kamel ‘body’ (comp. old English!) at least in the
object position. The third person plural pronoun tu is also used within the noun phrase to encode
plurality of human (or at least animate) entities (see section 2. 3. 1. 1)

The third person singular person pronoun kil sometimes functions as a demonstrative pronoun
instead of the near demonstrative ti, and may in this function be attached to other singular pronouns or
nouns (see also the first example above). In this function kil can refer both to animate and inanimate
entities:

In Urim, personal pronouns may be modified by demonstratives and quantifiers. When the far
demonstrative pa occurs modifying a personal pronoun, this construction has thematic function. The
demonstrative pa is used with personal pronouns to emphasize, express contrast, and mark something
as topical. This last function of pa makes it possible that in Urim texts two persons can be referred by
personal pronouns all the way through after initial introduction, even when the actor or speaker
changes:
Kupm asen kil pa om:.... Ari kil pa la-la:...
1sg

The Object pronominal clitics are phonologically adjoined to the verb. They conflate the nonsingular number categories of the free pronouns, distinguishing only: 1) first, second, and third
persons, and 2) singular versus non-singular numbers.
Person
1
2
3Singular
=opm
=etn/eitn
==elNon-Singular
=o
=epm
=enFollowing the applicative verbal suffix -n, a further inclusive versus exclusive distinction is made in
the first person plural forms:
1
1=(n)tilo
=nto/-(n)=ilo/
/-n=o/(Inclusive)
(Exclusive)In the form –(n)tilo /n/ surfaces in quick speech, but not in slow and careful speech.
It can be seen that the singular Object pronominal clitics and the second person plural form
resemble the free pronouns, but have undergone two changes: 1) loss of initial /k/, and 2) lowering of
the high vowels /i,u/ to /e,o/.
The Object pronominal clitics occur in the first Object slot, immediately following the verb, and
are phonologically bound to the verb. Consider the following examples:
Takgni
al =o
sun
eat.R-1plO
‘The sun burned us badly’
Kil

put.R-3plO road-road
‘They left them out (of the car) along the road’
Uwi – n – til=o!
take.IR-TR-3sgO-1plO
‘Take it for us!’
As the examples show, there are some morphophonemic changes when the pronoun clitic is
attached to the verb. These changes follow the general morphophonemic rules explained in Chapter
1.
It is also possible for the free pronouns to occur in the Object slot. Compare the following examples:
Tu
or-opm
3pl
hit-1sgO
‘They hit me’
Tu
or kupm ti-ke!
3sg hit 1sg
this/here-EMP
‘It was me they hit!’

tell.R-3sgOAtom kupm la naki kil pa
la-la: ....
then
1sg
say tell.R 3sg D
say-say
‘Then I told told to him:...’ (changing topic)
A bound pronominal Object is used when there is no need to highlight the pronoun for purposes
of contrast, emphasis, etc. The free pronoun is always used if any modifier co-occurs with the Object
pronoun. In the example immediately above, the demonstrative pronoun pa is used either for
emphasis or because the actor changes after this clause.
What is said here applies also when a personal pronoun is used to refer to a peripheral clausal
argument (its semantic role typically being Recipient-Benefactive or Locative-Goal) . It is promoted
to core argument in the form of bound pronoun when the referent is an already activated topic that is
simply being maintained. All uses of the bound Object pronouns are thematically unmarked ‘normal’
uses. The use of a free pronoun in this position indicates extra prominence or emphasis on the referent
(for more examples see Section 2.2.4).
The object pronominal clitics also occur as the result of a syntactic process of possessor
ascension, which lifts the possessor of an inalienable noun (usually a body part) out of the noun
phrase to serve as the Object of the verb. It is possible to have both the Object clitic and a coreferential genitive pronoun if the possessor referent is especially emphasized or in focus, as in the
second example below:44Drapuk

eyeWhen the verb and body part form a lexical unit, the Object pronominal clitic is obligatory. This
might be the origin of the use of suffix -el in idioms and lexemes as adverbializer. Compare
especially the two first examples below:

The genitive pronouns exhibit the same person, number, and exclusive-inclusive distinctions as
the independent pronouns, being formed by phonologically adjoining the relative clause
complementizer a to a following independent pronoun. In essence, then, genitives in Urim are
formally a kind of minimal relative clause: pig that (is) I/mine = my pig.
In addition, one or both of the following two modifications to the pronominal forms are possible:
1) the attributive suffix -en may be added to them, and 2) an /l/ may be added between the relative
clause complementizer a and the independent pronominal form. Thus, there are four possible forms
for each genitive pronoun. 8

The genitive pronouns occur following the noun and indicate relationships like: 1) kinship, 2)
body parts, 3) ownership, 4) production, 5) belongingness, 6) Exclusion/Emphatis (only the forms
containing the consonant /l/ but lacking the suffix; alkupm etc.).

"Independent / Free Pronouns
There are thirteen independent pronouns in Urim. These distinguish the following semantic
categories: 1) first, second, and third persons, 2) singular, dual, paucal, and plural numbers, and 3) (in
just the first person plural pronouns) whether or not the hearer is included.

kipm
tuFrom this tabulation, it can be seen that the dual forms consist of the plural form plus the numeral
(w)ekg ‘two’. The non-first person paucal forms contain the formative -teng, which does not
resemble the numeral wraur ‘three’. The first person paucal form appears to consist of the first
person plural exclusive pronoun plus a formative -to. 7 The paucal forms are used to refer to three to
six individuals. This is why the term paucal has been used rather than trial. The first person plural
inclusive form appears to be formed by adding the second person plural object clitic =epm to the first
plural exclusive form men. The short forms ekg for the dual forms and to and teng for the paucal
forms are used often after it has been made clear first to whom they refer. Ekg is also used to coordinate two NPs.",[39]

It is difficult to motivate a coordinating versus subordinating distinction for many of the
conjunctions. Therefore conjunctions are described here simply on a semantic basis according to the
type(s) of relationship they express. As is the case in many languages, some of the most common
Urim conjunctions seem to be morphologically composed of deictic forms. These are pa, ti, pake,
pipa and their combinations The deictic form pa has an especially wide range of conjunctive
functions. Some prepositions and time words (like a, eng, ak, am) play a role in connecting sentences,
as do a few verbs as well (e.g. la).",[207]

EMPTemporal connectivesIn Urim temporally related clauses can be simply juxtaposed without any intervening
conjunctions. The conjunctions wa ‘and’ and the causative pa, can mark also time relationships in
addition to their other functions. These are described elsewhere (see. 7.5.1 and 7.5.6). The
conjunction atom ‘then’ is more specialized to show temporal relationships between clauses. It seems
that atom is used whenever there is temporal sequence with a relatively greater amount of
discontinuity, due to a change in speaker, or the end of a sequence of closely related, normally cooccurring events, whereas juxtapposition and wa would indicate the juxtapposition of events which
more commonly co-occur. Also certain temporal adverbs, especially am ‘now’, function as temporal
connectives between clauses.","[215, 216]"
"168
The possessive clause is negated differently from most other clause types. Instead of the usual
negative particle ake the nominal negative word kalpis is used and there is no verb.10 Elsewhere,
only existence clauses are negated in this way (see Section 6.3.2). There are two other features shared
between existence clauses and possessive clauses: 1) use of the same verbs, and 2) the existence of
verbless variants. It might be possible to derive some types of possessive clause from an existence
clause or a locative clause by adding a topic, but the structure is fully grammaticalized and the topic is
obligatory.","[167, 168]"
"‘We saw a car (marked as new topic), coming towards us and it has no window glass.
The driver asked us .... We answered ... Then he drove his car down ...’
In the example above, zero-anaphora seems to indicate that the same topic is being maintained,
even though the Subject changes.
Sometimes it is possible to refer to two different participants by zero-anaphora without any
pronoun or full NP to show the change in referents, if this is clear from the semantic content of verb.
This has been found in spoken text only:

EMP‘At dawn she rose ... and it followed her ...It did that a long time and finally she was
sick and tired of it.’
In the text, from which the above example is taken, the main participant is a girl and the second
participant is a snake. The snake is only referred to with zero-anaphora or a full noun phrase, never
with a pronoun. The girl, on the other hand, is referred to using pronouns or zero-anaphora. In the
example above, all cases of zero-anaphora refer to the snake except the last one, which refers to the
girl. The identity of the referent of the last zero-anaphora is pragmatically inferred. Usually, however,
if the actor changes, a full pronoun with topic marker pa would be used
In those texts, where the topic is an Object, it is frequently represented by zero-anaphora when it
is maintained across multiple clauses:

sago-stems and burned, cut akrip-plants, they burned them together, when that was done,
they gathered the ashes into a big cooking pot. They carried the pot to fire, cooked ... At
dawn the salt was ready.’
Notice in this example, that the actor tu ‘they’ (actually an impersonal plural in Urim) is mostly
mentioned as a full pronoun and only once represented by a zero pronoun. This shows very clearly
that zero-anaphora in Urim is not governed by actor role, nor the grammatical role of subject. In
narrative texts where the topic is usually one of the participants, zero-anaphora usually refers to the
actor- subject.
Even in topic-chain, if it is long enough, there is a need eventually to insert a pronoun. Pronouns
are always used, when there is a switch from background to foreground or vice versa. In Urim
pronoun or full NP is often used also after a topic clause (see the section 4.8 about topic clause) even
when the topic keeps the same. Zero-anaphora never refers to the subject of a topic clause, which is
natural since the subject is hardly ever topical even in grammaticalized or lexicalized topic clauses.

"Possessive ClauseIn the possessive clause the semantic possessor occurs in topic position and the possessed item
occurs as grammatical subject. This is thematically consistent with the normal ordering of
information in the clause, since the referent of the possessor is usually given information, and the
thing possessed is new information. Since there is no agreement morphology on the verb to show
which NP is the grammatical subject, only word order and semantic content reveal it. The word order
seems to be fixed; the topic and the subject cannot change places in the clause. One example was
found where the subject appeared to occur between the two parts of an appositional topic noun phrase
(23e). The possessor is usually animate, and most often human. Possessive clause may have a verb
denoting the position of the possessed object. There are both verbal and verbless possessive clauses,
but positive possessive clauses are more frequently verbal. The verb seems to be obligatory if there
is another nominal constituent in the clause. Possessive clauses structurally resemble three other
clause types: equative clauses (23b), existence clauses (23e) and locative clauses (23a).

verb. However there are some exceptions: forms 17-21 and 25-27. In these verbs the realis /irrealis
vowel occurs in the second syllable of the verb. Forms 17-21 are all locative verbs. The occurrence
of the modal vowel in the last syllable could be a feature of this verb class. Locative verbs are
exceptional in other respects as well. It is harder to say why verbs 25-27 differ from other
phonetically similar verbs 28-30. One possible explanation for all those cases is phonetic. When the
first syllable of the verb ends with a nasal or liquid, even the realis vowel a gets so reduced that the
distinction of realis/irrealis would be hard to hear. Notice that the verbs with a habitual or transitive
suffix (forms 22-24) place the realis/irrealis vowel at the beginning of the same verb-stem!
When the vowel of the second syllable is /a/, this process of reduction is even stronger - this might
explain why only some of the verbs having the consonant [] on the first syllable place the modal
vowel on the second syllable.5
4 Sequences of voiceless stop plus homorganic nasal release are interpreted as unit phonemes. The reversed sequences
of nasal plus homorganic stop are interpreted as consonant clusters. (See Luoma, 1985)
5 This data would seem to be an excellent candidate for an optimality theory approach (which assumes that languages
have multiple constraints interacting which are ranked as being more or less important, and the forms which have the least
weighty violations are the ones which actually occur).","[22, 23]"

Urim is a non-Austronesian language spoken in Papua New Guinea. Laycock (1973) classifies it as a
stock-level isolate of the Torricelli Phylum. It is spoken by about 3400 people, who live in 16 villages
in the southern foothills of the Torricelli Mountains. Twelve of the villages are located south of the
Sepic Highway, and one is north of the highway, in the Maprik Sub-District of East Sepik Province. The
remaining three of the villages are located west of the Bongos River in the Nuku Sub-District of the
West Sepik Province. The villages west of the Bongos River speak the Kukwo dialect, and the villages
east of the Bongos River speak the main Urim dialect (also called Yangkolen by the Kukwo people).
The Urim language has also been called Kalp, which comes from the word kalpm ‘no’ in the Kukwo
dialect.
Earlier linguistic work on Urim was done by Glasgow and Loving (1964) and D.C. Laycock (1966 and
1973). The authors entered the area in 1979 under the auspices ot the Summer Institute of Linguistics
The data for this paper were collected mainly between 1980 – 1995 in the village of Laningwap. The
data includes a corpus of about 40 spoken and written texts along with some elicited material. The team
participated in a grammar analysis seminar at the S.I.L. center in Ukarumpa in 1981. Their consultants
were Robert Bugenhagen and Robert Conrad. Pirkko Luoma participated in a second grammar analysis
seminar in 1993 and was greatly helped by her consultant Robert Bugenhagen. Paul Heinemann also
provided many valuable suggestions and helped with the formatting of the paper.
This grammar consists of three parts that have been written independently from each other. The first
part, chapters 1 to 3, was written by Pirkko Luoma with some additions by Ritva Hemmilä. Chapter 4 is
an unpublished article written by Ritva Hemmilä in 1984. Chapters 5 and 6 were written by Ritva
Hemmilä with some corrections and additions by Pirkko Luoma.","[4, 5, 6, 7]"

treeComitative Serializations
Serialized constructions with the verbal preposition nampokgen ‘accompany’ are used to express
comitative notions. This word is fully grammaticalized to a preposition and is not used as a verb
anymore, but has retained realis-irrealis form. Its original meaning is not known and especially the
young people do not seem to connect the different realis and irrealis forms with mode, but use them
inconsistently. There are several freely alternating or dialect dependent forms of the word:
nampokgen (IR nimpokgen) and nampikgen (IR nimpikgen) in Urim 1 sub dialect, nampon (IR
nimpon) and nampiin(en) (IR nimpiin(en)) in sub dialect 2 and in Kukwo dialect. These can be used
when the accompanying party is either human or non human.
Serialized constructions with the verb anti (IR inti) ‘agree, comply with’ are only used if the
accompanying party is human. The verb ngkaten (IR ngkiten) ‘lift up with, carry with’ is used in
constructions expressing accompaniment when the object is actually physically carried.

Serialized constructions with the word (ok)atnen are used to express reason relationships.
Morphologically, it is reminiscent of the two forms ok ‘mouth’ and atnen ‘wait for, watch, hit a
target’. This construction may take either a noun phrase or sentence complement. Usually atnen has
somewhat negative meaning:

There are also two other serialized constructions containing the verb ak ‘do’, They are used to
express additional notions: aken ‘ to work with, add into’ (ak-en ‘do-with/TR’) and aklanti ‘in

Adjectives are defined as forms that can serve as either: 1) attributive modifiers of nouns within
the noun phrase, occurring immediately after the head noun and before all other modifiers, or 2) as
predicates. When adjectives occur as predicates, they never exhibit a realis-irrealis distinction. In
Urim, it is not usually possible for an adjective to occur in isolation as the head of the noun phrase,
except in elliptical contexts.

‘Pilpatni peeled yam and dried it. We other people ate it raw, she herself went to eat it

It is common in Urim for words to exhibit more than one syntactic function without any change in
form to mark the change in category, much like in English e.g. the word fish can function both as a
noun and a verb. This is especially true with the words that can function as modifiers of noun phrases
or as predicates. Very often the same word functions both as adjective and adverb in Urim without
any morphological change, for example such common words as paipm ‘bad; badly’ or wor ‘good;
well’.","[54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"

Why the genitive pronoun sometimes takes the attributive suffix -en and sometimes not needs to
be further studied. Probably the reason is pragmatic. The form with suffix -en is more emphatic. For
example, in a text dealing with a dispute about ownership of garden lands almost all of the genitive
pronouns have suffix -en because they are emphatic—i.e. ‘mine and NOT yours’. In the forms with
-en the possessor appears to be more “attributive”, not in focus and more tied to what is possessed.9
Whereas in the form without the suffix -en the genitive pronoun is more “loose” and more like a
relative pronoun. These two constructions may occur even as alternatives in the same context:

kupm (la) pa

REL
1sg say that
true
‘My talk is true = The talk that I talk is true’ (relative clause)
The genitive pronoun forms containing /l/ are used when the possessor is focused information or
emphatic / in contrast to someone else. Such forms often have the meaning ‘one’s own’.

Here the suffix -en is very much like the attributive suffix -en that marks modifiers and forms adjectives from other
words. Also certain other modifiers of NP sometimes occur with -en, sometimes without it:
warim

‘This is my hand (not someone else’s)’
When there is more than one third person participant or group of participants in the immediate
context, the genitive pronoun forms with and without /l/ are used to distinguish possessors. The
forms with /l/ usually refer to the contextually nearest revious third person possessor (usually this is
the Subject) and those without /l/ to some other third person possessor. Compare the following two
examples:

Use of the demonstrative pronoun pa also helps to identify the referent since it marks topic and
the change of topic:

With body parts, genitive pronouns are used only if it is necessary to mark the right owner. An
‘unnecessary’ use of genitive pronoun with body parts is often emphatic and can be glossed ‘own,
himself’:

Rule 3.
A semivowel /w/ is usually inserted between vowels at morpheme breaks, if the second
morpheme is a one-syllabic suffix or a bound personal pronoun. The semivowel /j/ is used instead of
/w/ if the phonetic features of the preceding word make pronunciation of /w/ more difficult (for
example, if the preceding syllable has /w/ already).

speech, the inserted consonant tends to be /j/ after /i/, and /h/ if the preceding syllable has /w/ already.
Native speakers tend to write only those inserted semivowels that occur inside the phonological
word. The inserted semivowels between a bound personal pronoun and word are written but the
inserted sounds occurring between a clitic and word are not written:

When the rule is applied optionally between words in rapid speech the inserted consonant is more
often [h] than [w] or [j]. The Laningwap dialect tends to have more inserted [h] sounds, Yakrumpok
uses more the semivowel [w]. Laningwap people say that old people use more [h].

"About Application of RulesMany rules, especially the schwa-rule (rule 10) but also most consonant insertion rules (rules 1, 2)
and the palatalization rule (rule 7) are conditioned by stress so that they either occur only in
unstressed syllables (schwa-rule) or in or after stressed syllables (consonant insertions).
Assimilation rules 7 and 8 and dissimilation rules 9 and 10 apply only inside a phonological word
(except rule 7 b: t --> ts change after palatalization, which can occur over word boundaries). These
rules serve to help in recognizing the phonological word.
Insertion and deletion rules 1-6 apply frequently over word boundaries in phrases and also
elsewhere in rapid speech. The closer knit the structure is, the more regularly most of these rules
apply.

interjectionsThe remainder of this chapter will examine each of the word classes in more detail, describing
their syntactic characteristics and morphological structure.
It is typical of Urim words in all word classes, that the same phonological form may instance
multiple classes; for example functioning as a noun and a verb, or as an adjective and an adverb.
Some phonological forms exhibit even more than two word classes. In some cases one of the
functions is clearly primary and the other function(s) secondary (for example many verbs can function
as heads in noun phrases without any morphological marking to indicate a change in category). More
often it is impossible to tell which word class is primary for a phonological form; it is bi- or multicategorical.

EMP2.2. Verbs and Their Morphology
Urim verbs are defined as forms having the following characteristics:
1. They may function as the main predicate in simple clauses

alm
manto, nalu
3sg
shoot.R pig
pick.R
‘He shot a pig and took some taro’wayu
taro2. They exhibit ablaut alternations for irrealis versus realis modality. Approximately two thirds of
the verbs exhibit this property. But all onomatopoetic and descriptive verbs and also many directional
verbs fail to exhibit this property: no irrealis forms of these verbs have been observed. One possible
reason for this might be that these types of verbs in Urim tend to occur together with other verbs (in
serial structures, etc.) rather than alone. To express modality several times in the same clause would
be unnecessary.

‘blink’3. Most verbs in Urim cannot occur in noun phrases. There are exceptions; 1) bi-categorial words—
the same lexical form can function either as verb or as noun. 2) Certain verbs have been
grammaticalized into prepositions. 3) The distinction between adjectives and stative verbs is not clear
in Urim. Many stative verbs may also function as adjectives in noun phrases, with no derivational
morphology to indicate a change in syntactic category.
4. Due to the realis/irrealis distinction, verbs as group also have some phonetic characteristics. A
large percentage of verbs begin with the vowel a (realis) or i (irrealis). Most Urim words beginning22
with the vowel /a/ are verbs. Verb roots usually consist of one or two syllables, with longer roots
being comparatively rare.
Morphologically, Urim verbs are simple in structure, not exhibiting any inflection for person or
number.2 The most important morphological category marked on verbs is a modal one. There is a
distinction of realis/irrealis mode that is indicated by the vowels i ‘irrealis’ and a ‘realis’. The
placement of these two vowels varies quite a bit depending on the canonical shape of the verb, but
usually they occur on the first syllable of the verb stem.
Aspectually, there is a habitual aspect suffix -e, and the use of reduplication of the verb stem to
express repeated or continued action. Most aspects in Urim are expressed by serial structures or
aspectual adverbs.
Two or three types of transitivity altering suffixes are also observed: 1) the transitivising suffix en , 2) the indirect object marker –n,which is possibly related to -en, and 3) the suffix -e which seems
to have both aspectual and transitivity changing functions. Forms homophonic with the suffixes -en
and -e are also used derivationally.
The overall order of constituents in the Urim verb is:
verb root (Habitual-Continuative -e) (Transitive -en) (IO-marker -n) (Object Pronominal Clitic)
In Urim a verb stem can be simple, reduplicated, compound, or consist of a root morpheme plus a
derivational affix (sometimes more than one) (see the section 2.12.3).","[19, 20, 21, 22]"
"Locative adverbial clauses:Locative adverbial clauses in Urim are comaratively rare. Sometimes adverbial clauses
expressing location are governed by prepositions, as in the following example.
Kirngka pa am rpma
wreren kupm
atne-we
snake.sp. D now lie.R
near
1sg
stand.R-TR
‘The kirngka-snake was lying near where I was standing’5.3.4.tike.
EMPPurpose-reason clauses marked by engThe basic function of the word eng is to mark oblique arguments. As a preposition, it governs
especially indirect objects (mostly Benefactive and Recipient roles) and also some direct objects of
less transitive verbs. To show the range of eng, I will first present here some examples of its use
governing noun phrases and then examples of its use as a complementizer within subordinate clauses.",[189]
"178
Urim seems to have no formal morphological devices to form lexical nouns from verbs or
adjectives. Both simple verbs and whole clauses can function as NPs without any overt change in their
morphological structure. Many lexemes freely function as both nouns and verbs, so that it is difficult
to tell which category is more basic. Others seem to be basically verbs but can function also as heads
of NPs.

comeBecause of the lack of morphological marking, it is often difficult to tell whether a construction is
part of a clause chain or a nominalization. One common feature to all nominalized verbs is that they
do not get irrealis mode.
Certain types of embedded clauses have also other formal features that separate them from normal
clauses:
a) reversed word order
Nominalized clauses can exhibit a reversed word order OV (instead of VO) when an object is present
but there is no surface subject in the embedded clause. Reversed word order also occurs in many
idioms and lexicalized expressions (e.f. won-huwen ‘inside-bury = forget’). It is especially nonreferential, generic objects, both nominal and clausal, that tend to occur before predicates in
embedded clauses. In following example an embedded clause functions both as the Subject and the
Object.

timeThe parts of this construction are never pronounced or written as one word. Another feature is that
the verb in this construction never gets irrealis mode. When the clause functions as object of a
‘normal’ verb (that is, not one of those verbs taking clausal objects, that are described later in 7.2.2.) it
always ha reversed word order OV. Reason to this might be pragamtical; reversed word order
disambiquates embedded clauses from serials (see the last example above). When the clause
functions as subject, reversed word order is optional. Consider the following example:
Antokg waprekg al yampis wekg ata, pa
ti
make smoke
eat bean
two
only that
this
’Smoking and eating beans, so these two only are forbidden.’angklon.
forbiddenb) habitual-continuative marker -e
In Urim the habitual-continuative marker -e often occurs in nominalized clauses, although this is
not the primary function of this device. Primarily it serves to mark continuity and habituality. This
device is more commonly used in relative clauses and sometimes also in adverbial clauses (see the
sections 3.1.3.2 and 5.2). It seems to be used in all types of embedded clauses that are of locative
type:
kar
arpm -e
ari
paipm
car
sit.R-CNT see.R bad
‘It feels bad to travel in a car’
These two devices, word order OV and suffix -e, may occur in any kind of embedded clauses, but
are not obligatory.","[177, 178, 179, 180]"
"Tracking participants and maintaining topics; anaphoraUrim speakers can refer back to known referents by using pronouns, zero-anaphora, or full noun
phrases. With noun phrases, the demonstrative pronoun pa usually occurs as a modifier in order to
mark of givenness of the referent:

From the examples above one can see, that pa is more a marker of textual givenness rather than
just a general marker of giveness. Items known from the speech situation are referred to by NP + pa
usually only when there is a real meaning of distance.","[250, 251]"
"Serial structuresSerial structures are formally of four types: coordinated, subordinated with main verb last,
subordinated with main verb first, and preposition-like serials. The functions of serial structures are
very various.
It is common to juxtapose several verbs together in Urim with no intervening conjunctions. In
some cases, the meaning of the combination is quite transparent, whereas in others it is more
opaque/idiomatic.

Verbs expressing the manner of action usually occur before the semantically main verb in the verb
phrase. Normally no other constituents occur between the manner verb and the predicate following
it.

4.1. Introduction and Chart of Clause Types
The clause is the basic syntactic unit occurring between the phrase and the sentence.1 When
describing the clauses of a language, it is important to clearly distinguish between the notions of text
clause and basic or kernel clause. Text clauses consist of both nuclear and peripheral elements, and
quite often some of the nuclear elements are not present in the clause if they are known from the
textual context or environmental context or are part of the semantic content of the verb. A basic
clause consists of nuclear elements only and is a ‘perfect’ or ‘full’ clause in the sense that it does not
have any elided constituents and it can be understood without a text context. Generative grammar
defines kernel clauses or sentences as being minimal in the sense that they cannot be derived from
other clauses. This excludes passive, imperative, interrogative etc. types from basic clause types.
(Lyons 1979, Givon 1984)
Nuclear elements of the clause are the predicate, which is usually a verb, and its obligatory or core
arguments. In nonverbal clauses the NP or adjective phrase functions as the predicate. In Urim a
clause can minimally consist of only a single predicative noun phrase. Basic clauses consisting only
of a verb are not allowed2, although this kind of text clause is very common as the result of ellipsis
and clause chaining. All clauses can also have various types of optional adjuncts: accompaniment,
instrument, time, location, reason, etc. In Urim the number of optional elements in a clause is usually
restricted to at most two. The occurrence of these is semantically determined, and does not affect the
description of the basic clause types.","[150, 151, 152]"

"Causative conjunctions pa, ti, and combinationsIntroduction
In Urim both the near demonstrative pronoun ti ‘this, here’ and the far demonstrative pronoun pa
‘that, there’ can serve as conjunctions. In addition to functioning as a demonstrative modifier in the
noun phrase, a locative adverb, and a topic marker, it also serves as a conjunction. The conjunction pa
is by far the most frequent of all Urim conjunctions, and occurs in a wide range of constructions from
coordinative to conditional. These demonstratives also occur as components in the following
compound conjunctions: conditional pipa ‘if’ (pa+pa - reduplicated form of pa), adversative pake
(pa+ completed aspect marker ise), which was illustrated earlier in Section 5.5.4.2 and in
combinations pa ti and ti pa.
It is a very common phenomenon in languages that deictic pronouns or words derived from
deictic pronouns also function as conjunctions. It is especially common to have causative
conjunctions formed out of demonstratives, since they point to textual material as the explanation,
reason, or basis for what is said.",[222]
"186
1dual
hear.R 2pl say tell.R-1pO say-say 2sg this now die.R PERF
‘We heard them tell us that you had died!’ (kitn ‘you’ refers to the hearer)
There are no other major formal differences between direct and indirect quotations except perhaps
the word kolpa ‘this way, thus’ which seem to occur only before direct quotes.
Urim also has a very curious type of quotation, which is basically direct but also exhibits features
of an indirect quotation. Thus far examples of this have only been observed in oral texts:
Kil
akwe -wopm la,
Kupm, kitn
3sg call.R-1sgO
say
1sg
2sg
‘He called me saying, you, come down!’nar-o!’
come down-IMPIn speech both pronouns, kupm ‘I’ and kitn, ‘you (sg)’ have the same kind of raised imperative
intonation. The first pronoun in the quotation refers to the subject of calling and at the same time to
the speaker. The second pronoun refers to the one being called. (It is not clear whether this structure
is also possible for other person combinations. Also, it would be interesting to know, whether this
kind of double-pronoun imperative clauses are pragmatically special. If so, then the first pronoun
could be a kind of ‘signature’ or identification of the caller meaning something like ‘it is me here who
is calling’.)5.3. Adverbial Clauses
Adverbial clauses are embedded clauses, which modify some other clause, in a way similar to the
way adverbs function as modifiers within a clause. Just as with adverbs, which are single words or
phrases, adverbial clauses can be labelled and categorized semantically according to the type of
modification they provide (Sandra A. Thompson in Shopen II p.171). In Urim we have found at least
following semantic types of adverbial clauses: time, manner, locative, and purpose-reason. Other
subordinated clauses, like conditionals, are described in sections 7.5.7 and 7.6.","[185, 186]"
"Experience ClauseThe topic of an experience clause is also always animate and semantically an experiencer. The
grammatical subject is usually either a body part, where the feeling etc. is located, or an inanimate
referent which is the cause of the feeling or the object of wanting etc. The only common features
such clauses exhibit are: 1) the semantic meaning of involuntary experience, and 2) the presence of an
obligatory topic constituent before the grammatical subject. Most experience clauses have a bound
object pronoun which is coreferential with the topic (24a), (24d), but this pronoun can be absent,
especially if the grammatical subject is a body part of the experiencer (24b), (24c).
The experience clauses with body parts differ structurally from genitive constructions, which are
always of the form Npossessed + a + Ngenitive (wam a melnum ‘man’s hand’) when the possessor is
specific (see section 3.1.4).

‘How much is that?’
(Notice, that while in English a demonstrative can occur by itself to encode a

usually occur by itself in the Subject position)

The combination ur pa has special uses introducing new topics into a discourse (see section
4.7.2.1). In some cases pa is used without ur in the same introducing function despite the fact that the
referent is being mentioned for the first time and cannot be known to the hearer. In this function both
deictic and definite meanings have become bleached and the sole function of pa is to indicate the
introduction of a topic:

The position of pa (and other demonstratives) in the noun phrase is after quantifiers and before
the indefinite pronoun ur. Exceptionally pa may occur before qualifier or quantifier. In these cases
the function of pa is to emphasize the modifier instead of whole NP:2.9.2.","[91, 92, 93]"

‘ate (it) all’

adverb ise occurs.

‘The water is hot (has boiled)’In the following cases as well, the serial verb marking modality or aspect occurs after the clause it
semantically modifies. This order helps to differentiate the aspectual meaning of the verb from other
meanings.

Conative modality—attempting to do something—is expressed using the verb ari (irrealis form
iri)‘to see’.

Durative aspect expressed via repetition of verbs
Especially in spoken texts, verbs can be repeated several times at the end of clauses expressing
durative aspect; i.e. the action continues for an extended period of time. This repetition of verb seems
to never occur at the end of a sentence, only between clauses. Sometimes the adverbs ninan or titan
are used in addition or instead of the repetition of verb. Rising intonation always occurs with these
devices. Written texts do not exhibit this repetition of verbs to express durative aspect, whereas ninan
and titan do occur in written texts.

noun to express source / ‘from’. . This construction is used when an actor is coming from a place
where he has been for a while. In fast speeh, the existential verb (especially the most common ones,
ha ‘be’ and tna ‘stand’) frequently phonologically reduce into a prefix-like form ang-.

The last example, which is from a written text, shows that the reduced form ang- is not just a
feature of rapid speech. Source phrase is partly idiomatized.
Coming from a direction (without the meaning of staying there first) is expressed without
existential verb:
kil
kinar

‘He is coming from the direction of road’
This phrase can also occur as a part of locative phrase.","[200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205]"
"Verb plus Demonstrative Adverb ConstructionsUrim has also special type of construction consisting of a motion or locative verb and
demonstrative adverb. These seem to be partly lexicalized serial structures functioning adverbially.
All three demonstrative words, pa, ti, and ai, can occur in this construction, kil only seldom.
Actually these three demonstratives are found in clear contrast only in this construction:
Kil
rpma
kai-pa
3sg
sit.R
go-there
‘He sits there’ (the referent is visible)
Kil
rpma
kai-ti / ti
3sg
sit.R
go-here / here
‘He sits here’ (near the speaker)
Kil
rpma
kai-ai
3sg
sit.R
go-remote
‘He sits over there’ (more distant compared to something else or not visible at all)
Often the serialized verb is added just to give more information about the location of referent like
in the following example:
Kil
kul karkok wang-wang rmpa-wai
3sg come blaze.R stem-stem lie -remote
‘He came and blazed the tree-stems lying there.’
Yo
kinar
ai
trum
tree go.down remote
kapok
‘The tree down there is kapok’100
In other cases the serialized construction is used because plain demonstrative adverb could
potentially be misinterpreted as a topic or emphatic marker. This is particularly the case with pa:
Ti
kai itni
kai
pa!
so
go
stand.IR go
there
‘Go then to stand over there!’
pa alone could be interpreted as emphatic marker.
Tu
awi
wayu
3pl take.R taro
‘They took that taro’ela
bepa
thereHere pa alone would be interpreted as givenness marker.
There is also a more lexicalized construction ha-pa /ha-ti which is usually pronounced as one
word. It is used only when introducing new non-topical referents into the text, usually inanimate
instruments or objects. Its function is to show that the instrument or object was already at hand or
near by when the action started.

In Urim, most conjunctions and conjunctive forms are clause initial. Some, however, are clause
final, and some are discontinuous. Many conjunctions operate on more than one level. For example,
the conjunctions a ‘and’, aki ‘or’ and kol ‘if, like’ can connect phrases, clauses, or sentences. Some
conjunctions, like atnen ‘because of’ and eng ‘therefore, so that’ govern embedded adverbial clauses,
but never connect independent sentences. Some conjunctions connect only clauses (pipa, titan), while
many connect both clauses and sentences (pa, atom etc.). In Urim there are following conjunctions.
Coordinating conjunctions:102a (sometimes wa after words ending in a vowel)
wa.....wa
aki
ari
pake‘and’‘and....again/also/further’
‘or’
‘but’
‘but’
(combination of pa ‘that’ + ise ‘PERF’ ---> pa-ke)Coordinating or weakly subordinating, temporal or expressing continuity:
... plalng, .... plalng pa, ... plalng pipa ‘after that, (when that had happened or finished)’
....titan, ....ninan
‘after that (a longer happening or action
finished)
am
‘now, then’ (immediately) (basically time word
‘now’)
atom
‘then, and’
Subordinating conjunctions:
- causative and conditional:

....pati
‘what comes to that’
(kolpa) atom ‘so, therefore (often past)’

‘that’(starts a new topic, from the verb la ‘speak’)
(semantically neutral complementizer governing the clausal
object of certain verbs)As is the case in many other languages, in Urim a number of the conjunctions appear to be built
out of demonstratives. The commonest conjunction in Urim, pa, is a near demonstrative ‘that’. This
demonstrative occurs also as part of conjunctions pake, pipa, pilpa, kolpa and pati. Three
conjunctions, kol, eng, and atnen a transparently related to prepositions. As well as taking nominal
complements, eng and atnen can also govern a clausal complement. Atnen is probably originally a
verb (there is a verb atnen ‘wait for, watch; hit). The conjunction ari ‘but’ is phonetically similar to
the verb ari ‘see’, but it is not clear whether or not this is an accidental resemblance. The verbs la
‘see’ and plalng ‘finish’ function as conjunctive forms too. The function of plalng as conjunction
resembles tail-head linkage which connects full sentences. Very much like conjunctions function the
words titan and nanan and reduplicated verb marking continuity. These words and reduplication
occur (often together) between clauses to show that the action described in the first clause continues
until the action of second clause starts. This structure and tail-head linkage are described in Chapters
5.5.7 and 5.7. Other conjunctions are described more fully in the Chapter 5. 5.

Usually Urim conjunctions occur clause initially. Some conjunctions have two possible positions
between clauses, either at the end of the first clause before the pause, or after the pause starting the
second clause. This position seems to make the conjunction stronger, emphasize it, and sometimes is
also provides slightly different meaning compared to the initial position. In speech the conjunction
occurring clause finally usually gets prominent (high pitch - long vowel) intonation.

More rarely the conjunction in Urim may also occur inside the clause. In most cases the position
of conjunction in the middle of clause can be explained thematically. Fronting of object can move it
even to the front of conjunctions. This may be a feature of spoken language only.

2.12.1. The Problem of Word Boundaries in Urim
In Urim there are some difficulties in determining whether a construction is a compound word or
a phrase. Phonological criteria alone are not sufficient, because a grammatical phrase may
phonologically be one word, especially idioms. On the other hand, the boundaries of a phonological
word are not very clear in Urim. Many morphophonemic rules can be applied over a larger domain,
some apply over a more restricted domain than phonological word. Here we will briefly consider
various rules and other boundary marks that help to determine word boundaries in Urim.
a) Stress
Stress is the clearest mark of a phonological word in Urim. A phonological word can have only one
main stress in Urim, as indicated in the following examples:107
‘kol
like‘like this’‘ti
this‘only’‘kol#ti
like-this
‘wris
one‘only one’‘ata
onlyki’pman ‘wris#ata
man
one-only‘only men’ (not ‘only one man’!)‘yankipm#ok
talk-mouth‘talk’i’lkim
pit‘ok
mouth‘mouth of a pit’‘maur
spirit‘kanokg-en
ground-ATR‘a spirit living inside the ground’‘ka
grasshopper‘grasshopper sp.’‘maur#ka’nokg-en
spirit-ground-ATRHowever, stress is not very reliable in determining whether or not the construct is grammatically
one word, because two nouns or two verbs can be joined phonologically under one stress when no
modifiers occur in between:
‘door’‘wan#yun
house-door
‘wan
house‘wail
big‘yun
door‘door of a big house’compare to:
‘wan#yun
house-door‘wail ‘ur
big
ID‘put (it) down!’elng#’kirmpi!
put-lie:IR
‘elng
putwur’kapm
paper‘a big door’rm’pi!
lie.IR‘put the book down!’These constructions could easily be interpreted as compounds, if it was not known that another
word could be inserted. The expressions are phonologically words but grammatically phrases.","[99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107]"
"24
Phonetically, the irrealis vowel tends to get reduced and shortened so that it practically disappears,
especially when a verb stem begins with a nasal or liquid—i.e. a [-obst] consonant—the irrealis vowel
can the consonant coalesce, yielding a syllabic consonant. In these cases irrealis i is not written in
orthography (which follows pronunciation rather than the underlying morphemic form). Irrealis i is
sometimes pronounced (and written) [u] especially if the obstruents /k/ or /p/ precede or follow it and
if the second syllable or verb stem has u-vowel: karkuk - kurkuk ‘bathe’, nakure - nukure
‘decorate’, kaluk - kuluk ‘wash’’.
Irrealis verb forms are used in the following contexts:

4. CommandsThere seem to be several factors involved in the placement of the vowel, which have different rankings:
1. Avoid 3 syllable verbs (most important)
2. Avoid vowel clusters **VV
3. Avoid syllable final consonant clusters **CC
4. Avoid syllable initial consonant clusters **...CC
5. Place the vowel as near to the front of the root as possible (least important).
The forms occurring are those, which best satisfy these principles. If it is not possible to satisfy all of them, then forms
which violate the lower principles are preferred to those which violate the higher ranked ones.","[23, 24]"

Another means to raise an inanimate entity to the subject position of a transitive clause is to add
the verb ak ‘(use something to) do’ to the predicate. Consider the following examples:Nok
ak
karpon
sago
use.R
stick.R
‘Sago sticks to the plate’tis

key
use.R
close.R
‘The key closed the door’wanyun
doorWripm
ar
wanyun
wind
open.R door
‘Wind opened the door’ (potent noun as subject)
The semantic roles of the Subject in these transitive clauses are Cause or Instrument. The verb ak
in the second members of the example pairs could be interpreted as causative marker. On the other
hand, notice the use of ak as an Instrument marker in third and fourth example (see 2.5.1).","[32, 33]"
"The demonstratives pa and ti have a wide range of discourse functions. These are discussed
more thoroughly in the paper ‘Demonstrative Pronouns in Urim Discourse’ (LLM 1989). Here we
will indicate those functions only briefly. Both pa and ti are also used as conjunctions. These
functions are described later in section 5.5.6.",[90]
"Important Semantic Classes of NounsAmong nouns, the following semantic distinctions have significant morpho-syntactic
consequences.
1.
2.
3.
4.personal (thought of as being in the same class as people) versus non-personal

Personal nouns have the following morpho-syntactic properties:
1.",[31]
"The temporal conjunction atom ‘then’
The conjunction atom indicates temporal sequence, basically expressing that the second action
occurs relatively soon after the first action. It is especially common in narrative type of texts. In
those types of texts it can also mark the change of speakers in conversations (here its use overlaps
with the use of ari, see 5.5.3.): In spite of its frequency, atom is not the most frequently used
connective between clauses denoting subsequent happenings and actions in texts. More common are
clause-chains without any markers, and conjunctions wa ‘and’ and pa ‘ then’. In spoken texts also the
time word am ‘now’ and tail-head linkage are quite commonly used in this function (see 5.7).
In narrative texts atom seems to occur most often when there is a change of actor or speaker or
some other kind of change of topic. There are some stories where atom occurs in almost every second
clause but these kinds of stories are apparently not of the best style in Urim. The best storytellers use
atom more sparsely.
It looks like atom is used whenever there is temporal sequece with a relatively greater amount of
discontinuity. The continuity can be due to a change in speaker, or the end of a sequence of closely
related, normally co-occurring events, whereas juxtaposition and wa ‘and’ would indicate the
juxtaposition of events which more commonly co-occur.

Wrongkatnur and Balus two D go.up then Balus go.up road ascend
‘Wrongkatnur and Balus went together, then Balus took the road going upwards’
Atom often marks beginning of a new paragraph. Occasionally it is used in the beginning of a
story after introduction:

pa ukwa warim pa la...
mother child two D
then mother D
send.R child D say
‘There was a mother and child. The mother send the child to an errand saying,...
(beginning of a story)
(The occurrence of atom before pause makes it more emphatic. In this position it is also
pronounced with strong and rising intonation)
The conjunction atom quite often occurs together with the conjunction pa when there is
conditional and causative meaning connected with the time sequence:

In its function of marking a change of actor or some other kind of discontinuity in the story, atom
often occurs together with the neutral coordinative conjunction wa ‘and’:

‘But Dik said’ - And then Dik said...(a joke follows)

-If the actions form an habitual sequence of actions. Compare the following examples

‘She herself made [the food] and then she herself ate it alone’ (unusual action)- When the clauses just tell about moving from one place to another or some other sequence of

We have seen above that atom has a double function: 1) it conjoins clauses relating successive
events, and 2) it indicates some sort of discontinuity in the story—change of actor, change of direction
of movement, change of topic etc.

The use of atom overlapping with other conjunctions.
The use of the conjunction atom partly overlaps that of pa. Both can have temporal or causative
interpretations. The conjunction pa is more often used to express causal relations, however, while
atom is more favored for temporal ones. Another difference is that atom usually expresses some sort
of discontinuity.
Atom also overlaps with ari (change of speakers in conversations). The difference is that ari
emphasizes the element of surprise or contrast.","[216, 217, 218, 219]"
"Manner Adverbs and Frequentative Temporal AdverbsIn Urim, manner adverbs normally follow the predicate and both the direct and indirect object and
usually any eng prepositional phrases that are present (but they may occur before the eng
prepositional phrase if they are in focus). In this respect they differ from onomatopoetic and
descriptive verbs, which usually occur before the main verb (see also the section 5.4).
