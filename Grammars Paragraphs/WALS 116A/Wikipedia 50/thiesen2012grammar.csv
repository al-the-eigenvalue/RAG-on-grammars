"©2012 SIL International ®Chapter 15Question Formation
There are two types of question: “yes/no” questions (15.1) and “ content”
questions (15.2).
Questions are spoken with the same intonation as declaratives, but
there may be tone changes.","[382, 383]"
"©2012 SIL International ®12.3. PARTICLES321a(:) (a) ‘yes/no’ is used to ask questions that can be answered with ‘yes’
or ‘no’.
(822) a m phè-é-?i Q A u p eéh i?)‘Are you going?’
y/h you go-fut-(t)
a-kha (aca) (yh-doubt aca) is used to ask regarding something that the
speaker heard, asking for confirmation and simultaneusly indicating
disapproval or incredulity, as in 823. (See also example 785, page
313.)
(823) lA ca u peéhi?

m phè-é-?i
‘You are going?!

a-§a (ava) (yh-rpt ava) is used to ask regarding something reported by
another person (not the person to whom the question is addressed):
(824) ïA va u peéhi?
a-§a m phè-é-?i

"15.1Yes/no questionsYes/no questions are formed from indicative sentences by starting them
with a ‘yes/no’,1 as in 921 and 922. (See also example 955, page 361.)

: In isolation this is aa, as in aa (,jA a?) ‘W hat?’ .",[383]
"12.1ConjunctionsBora has no word like English and. The conjunction o f nominals is
achieved by means of suffixes or by a “ summation” word as discussed in
section 7.6.
There are two disjunctive morphemes, ami ‘or’ and mitjha ‘or’, which
to our knowledge are entirely interchangable. They are used to ask which
of two alternatives is correct, occurring between the clauses that express
the alternatives, as in the following examples:
(818) iA u majchoó mitya tsa u majchóityune?
a m maxf ho-ó-? mitjha teha? m max$hó-i-tjhm-nè
yh you eat-fut-(t) or

‘Will you eat or not?’

ellipsed:

this one (go)?’InterjectionsThe interjections listed below express the speaker’s emotions or attitude.
They are never part of a sentence.1
uix ( uj) ~ hm?m:: (juhuu) expresses surprise
^hix (chfj) ~ $4:: (chff) expresses surprise or admiration
pó:o: (n ó ó o o ) expresses happiness
Many other interjections are used in the interaction between people:
to get another’s attention, to answer, or to indicate a reaction. A few of
the more common follow:
éhè (é je ) calls attention to look at something (like English ‘Look!’)
ahm (a ju ) calls attention to receive something given (like English ‘Here!
Take it!’)
aax (a a j) answers a call or indicates a question (like English ‘Yes, what do
you want?’)
hmmhmx (juujuj) ~ hmm (juu) ~ uiui ( uu) indicates agreement (like En­
glish OK.)
maa?mmx (m aah u u j) indicates that one does not know (like English ‘I
don’t know!’)
hm:m (juuu) indicates incredulity (like English ‘I can’tbelieve it!’12.3ParticlesThe PARTICLES listed below call attention, express surprise, ask permis­
sion, and so forth. In contrast to the interjections discussed in section
12.2, the particles are sentence constituents.
1H ow ever, they m ight be used at the m argin o f a sentence, much like w e m ight say in
English “ OK. I’ll go.”","[353, 354]"

Example 959 begins “ I was gladdend” (not included in 959), followed
by an adverbial clause of the sort discussed in section 17.4.2. The verb of
this clause is “teil,” which has an object complement expressing what was
told. (The subject o f the complement clause is the noun phrase “ those to
whom I taught the truth.”) The structure o f 959 is given in figure 16.4:

An object complement may be an embedded content question, as in
the subordinate clause beginning with mm-:pè-khé ‘whom’ in 960 and with
mm-?a ‘who’ in 961. Embedded alternative questions are expressed using
a conditional clause, as in 973.

-© thm (-tu) ‘negative’; see section 13.2. The other two are glossed (0) and
(event). This section deals with the contrast between these two.
(0) represents a thing, that is, an inanimate object that typically persists
over time (and can be localized in space). By contrast, an event typically

not typically have the time stability o f objects.5 Both - © 0 nG ($) an^ -ne
(event) are used following subordinate verbs, so the verb’s initial syllable
bears high tone. However, the former imposes a low tone on its host’s
penult while the latter does not:
#ü...crane(0) (thing)
#a...aone(event)This difference is visible only on verbs that have three or more syllables,6
as in 962, in which the tone of the verb’s penult (/pa/) correlates with
whether the clause bearing -ne refers to an object (962a) or an event
(962b):

"15.2.1Animate interrogative pronounsAnimate interrogative pronouns are masculine, feminine or unspecified
for gender. They are third person, and either singular, plural or dual. See
table 15.3 and the examples that follow.

In 930 the interrogative pronoun bears -© khe ‘objAn’ because it is an
animate direct object:

mm-:pè-khé
m tehi§a-?i
WH-(SgM)-objAn.£? you bring-(t)‘Whom (SgM)
do you bring?’As stated above, the interrogative phrase generally ends with a high tone
(glossed “ .£?”.) There are two cases where this is not so. First, mm?a ‘who’
never bears a final high tone. Second, in an embedded question (discussed
on page 364) the interrogative word ends with a low tone.
When used as the subject of a clause, the forms that end in /e/ change
this to a high tone /a/, as shown in 931 and illustrated in 932.

(932) ïMuuba tsaahif?
mm-:pa
teha:-?ii
WH-(SgM).<? come-(t)‘Who (SgM) comes?’Likewise, when the interrogative phrase is an object terminated with the
animate object suffix, the form is -kha rather than -khe; for example:
(933) ïMuca u tsivahi?
mm-kha
m tehi§a-?i
WH-objAn.i? you bring-(t)‘Whom (Sg/Du/Pl) are
you bringing?’These two facts— the final high tone and the vowel change— are evidence
of an interrogative suffix that ( 1) has a @ to be docked on its host’s final
syllable, and ( 2) causes the change o f /e/ to /a/.2
The interrogative pronouns o f table 15.4 ask for the identification of
the person or animal with respect to some group (in the same way that
which does in English). When used in a question, the final syllable of the
interrogative phrase bears high tone but (unlike the forms in table 15.3)
do not change /e/ to /a/. (These interrogative pronouns are also used in
embedded questions; see examples 960 and 961, page 364.)

low for medial and high for distal.10
The animate demonstrative pronouns are generally used to refer to be­
ings (people or animals) that are within view, as in 543:
(543) a:nm
teha-hmkhó:-?i (A a n u tsa ju cóó h i.) ‘This one (SgM)
this.SgM come-now-(t)
has now come.’
They may also be used to answer a question. For example, the question in
544a could be answered by 544b:
(544) a. khia ti-:piè
Q K ia d ifb ye?) ‘Where is he?’
where that-(SgM)
(lit. ‘Where he?’)
b. a:nm:(A a n u u .) ‘He is here.’this.SgM8.4.2Inanimate demonstrative pronounsInanimate demonstrative pronouns are not specified for gender; they are
third person and may be singular, dual or plural. These are formed by
adding a classifier to i- ‘demonstrative proximate’ e(:)- ‘medial’ and &‘distal’. For example, see é-xphi in 545 and é?-kpa: in 546:
(545) tehi-xphi
é-xphi
(tsfjpi é jp i)‘another’s person
other-(SgM) that-(SgM)
(or animal)’
(546) ...dihnéw aa M o itsee éh w aa, Erfa éhw aa...
[ti?pé-kpa:] [moitehée é?-kpa:]
[èrïa é?-kpa:]
your-(slab) Moses that-(slab) Elijah that-(shelter)
‘ ...your shelter, Moses’ shelter, Elijah’s shelter...’
Any o f the classifiers can be used in this way. Table 8.4 illustrates
this for -nè ~ -pè ‘thing’, -kpa ‘slab, plank, table, bench, machete, knife
and similar things’, and -?a:mi ‘leaf, paper, book, bill, and similar things’.
The proximate, medial, and distal demonstratives are given as singular,
dual (with -:khm ‘duin’), and plural (with -(?)hi ‘plural’). Note that, with
perhaps a few exceptions, the medial and distal differ by the tone of the
second syllable: low for medial and high for distal.
10Also note that in tw o places the first consonant is not palatalized b y the preceding a:-,
nam ely the singular masculine proxim ate and distal forms. In a:-ti: the palatalization may
sim ply be masked b y the follo w in g /i/. It may be that in a:-nm: ‘this (S gM )’ palatalization is

‘plural’. The classifiers used in table 15.5 are -ne, which refers to things
in general (not specified), -mi, which refers to canoes, cars, airplanes and
other means of transport, and -hi, which refers to disk-like things (including coins, pills, buttons, the earth, the sky,...).

Sometimes a point can be made very effectively by using the form of a
question, but without really expecting an answer, that is, by a R H E T O R IC A L
Q U E S T IO N . For example, a speaker could say 942 to make the point that
the hearer has come without bringing something for the speaker:

Adverbial subordinate clauses are discussed in chapter 17. There are
various types of nominal subordinate clauses. Relative clauses are dis­
cussed in chapter 18. Complements are dealt with here in section 16.2:
subject complements in section 16.2.1 and object complements in section
16.2.2.
The first syllable o f the verb of a subordinate clause bears high tone,
represented here by S over the vowel. For example, compare 944a, a

Early Attachment. The analyses (given at the foot of the page) generally
favor early attachment. For example, the sentence in 1194a could be
analyzed either as in 1194b or as in 1194c:

c. ... [manioc [we peel] we wash]
b. ‘after having peeled the manioc, we wash it’
c. ‘after having peeled it, we wash the manioc’©2012 SIL International ®476APPENDIX G. BORA TEXTSIn 1194b, the direct object ‘manioc’ is attached to the verb ‘we peel’ and
then this phrase is attached t o ‘we wash’. ; hence [[DO s-V] s-V]. In 1194c,
on the other hand, the attachment of ‘manioc’ is deferred until ‘we peel
(it)’ has been attached to ‘we wash’; hence [DO [s-V s-V]].","[508, 509, 510]"
"©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 13. NEGATION32813.3.1-jt+va with verbsWith verbs, -hi:(§a) ‘deny’ imposes a low tone on its host’s final syl­
lable. Further, the host’s initial syllable must bear high tone (in the
same way as -© thm ‘neg’; see section 3.10.) Thus, the form for verbs
is: # @ ...- © h i:(a ).
When someone is accused o f doing something bad, he can emphatically
deny this by saying:
(848) o me:nm-:pè-hi:§a (0 méénuubej++va.) ‘I did NO T do it!’
I do-(SgM)-deny
Note that— contrary to the PREVERBAL SUBJECT CONSTRAINT, page
129)— there seem to be two subjects in 848: the preverbal o ‘I’ and the
postverbal classifier -©:pe (SgM). However, this is not the case if its
structure is as in 849, where the clause is subordinate:
(849) [o mernra ]-:pè
[v hi:§a ]
I do
-(SgM)
deny
This structure not only resolves the conflict with the PREVERBAL SUBJECT
CONSTRAINT, it also accounts for the verb’s initial high tone (since the
initial syllable o f the verb o f a subordinate clause always bears a high
tone).
The question in 850a could be answered by either 850b or c. The
difference is that 850b is more emphatic than 850c:
(850) a. iA tsuuca dftyaaba majchójucóó?

"Authorship
Wesley Thiesen, who— along with his wife Eva— worked intimately with
the Bora people from 1952 to 1998, drafted a grammar sketch o f Bora
in Spanish but for the Bora people, to be included in the Bora dictionary
(Thiesen & Thiesen 1998). In response to questions from David Weber (as
linguistic consultant) this sketch grew to the point that it was decided that
it should be published as a separate volume (Thiesen 1996).2
Weber began transforming one of the intermediate Spanish versions
into a more linguistically oriented English document, raising more ques­
tions, exploring deeper linguistic issues, dividing examples into morphemes and glossing them, and refining analyses. The analysis of tone
was particularly difficult, but we are now satisfied that the analysis given
in this volume gives reasonable coverage, although there are still a few
unresolved issues.3
: An earlier draft o f this grammar was circulated in 1998 and another in 2000. The content
has not changed much since the 2000 draft. Publication has been delayed a decade for
w ork-related reasons beyond the authors' control.
2Unless otherwise indicated, references to Thiesen are to W esley Thiesen.
3T o study the Bora tone system, Thiesen (circa 1954) identified 18 verbs that instantiated
the range o f tonal behaviors. He elicited each verb in 165 frames consisting m ostly o f differ­
ent suffix combinations. He also identified 15 animate and 15 inanimate nouns. He elicited
each animate noun in 28 frames and each inanimate noun in 31 frames. Although some o f
the root-fram e com binations w ere not possible, over 3850 words w ere elicited.
T o facilitate seeing patterns o f tone, he made exhaustive charts representing just tone and
length, i.e., suppressing the phonological segments. For the verbs, this resulted in what©2012 SIL International ®PrefacexxviThe list of classifiers in appendix E was translated from a draft of

(thematic), as when responding to a question about the object. Perhaps
these are not sentences, but relative clauses (in elliptical responses). As
such, the high tone on the first syllable o f each verb marks the clause as
subordinate.","[308, 309]"
"©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 8. PRONOUNS234However, in single word responses to questions the vowel is long, as in
530:
(530)a. o:-khè (O ó k e.) ‘To me.’
b. mè:-khè (Meéke.) ‘To us (in.).’8.1.2 The use of personal pronouns
First and second person pronouns are used to refer to the speaker(s) and
hearer(s) as needed. Third person pronouns are used either to “point” to a
referent in the external context or to establish coreference with another
referring expression, usually one that has been previously established.
This latter use o f pronouns competes with two alternatives: (1) with the
anaphor i ‘self’, and (2) with the use of a classifier subject to refer to the
subject. We comment briefly on these in turn.
First, i ‘self’ is an anaphor, so must be bound within a very local domain
(as discussed further in section 8.3) while the personal pronouns must not
be bound within that domain. For example, consider 531, the structure
o f which is represented in figure 8.1. The possessor in the subordinate
clause is ti-:piè (that-(SgM)) and it is bound from outside o f the subordinate
clause. (It could refer to the speaker’s brother or any other male other
than the speaker himself.) If instead it were i ‘self’, as in 1157, page 439,
it would be bound by the subject o f its clause and thus refer to “ me” rather
than to John.4

phrase in apposition to the direct object.","[267, 268]"

be right. It is too complicated. How would children learn it?”
We agree that our description— and the analysis implicit in it— are too
complicated. Of course, the complexity of the facts themselves cannot
be reduced. (Indeed, further study will undoubtedly bring to light more
complexities.) The challenge, therefore, is to find analyses that reduce
the complexity.
8. Bora— it seems— has no stress system aside from the system o f tone:
there do not seem to be stressed versus unstressed syllables, only high
tone versus low tone syllables. In basic design, the Bora tone system
is not unlike the accentual system o f Lithuanian described by Kenstowicz (1994:584ff.). We do not discount the possibility that Bora’s tone
system is a stress system implemented on tone. Kenstowicz (1994)
says that Milner proposes such an analysis for Winnebago; Kensto­
wicz writes (p. 595) “The accent is interpreted as high tone” and (p.
596) “ The accent in Winnebago is apparently realized tonally (Milner
1979)”. (Consult Kenstowicz (1994) for references.)
9. Bora drum communication raises various intriguing questions: Given
that there is relatively little lexical tone, why is it possible at all? What
is the range o f messages that can be communicated? To what extent
does it depend on conventional frames?
10. Across Bora clans there are small dialect differences, most prominently, with regard to palatalization. There are differences in tone.
This merits further study.
A language spoken to the north in Colombia, Muinane, is closely related
to Bora. According to Mike Maxwell (personal communication) it has
a pitch-accent system: very roughly, words begin with some number of
high tone syllables and are thereafter followed by low tone syllables.
Perhaps this is the result o f the collapse of a system like that of Bora.
Tone has not been sufficiently studied in other members of the Witotoan
family such as Witoto and Ocaina.
Aschmann (1993) has done an admirable job of reconstructing the segmental phonology of Witotoan. However, reconstructing the system of
tone is an outstanding challenge.","[131, 132]"

b. He* got that in order that he^ eat it.
C O M P L E M E N T CLAUSES:In 538 i max$ho-nè (self eat-(n)) is the complement o f the ïmi^e- ‘to want’.
In 538a the subject of the complement is i ‘self’, which is bound by the
subject o f the higher verb. By contrast, the overt pronoun in 538b must
not be bound by the subject o f the main clause, so necessarily refers to
someone other than the subject o f the main clause:
(538) a. Im fllém é im ajchone.
b. Im fllém é dibye m ajchone.imi^é-mé
want-(AnPl)
a. They want to eat.
b. They want him to eat.
Likewise, in 851b, page 328, the anaphoric subject of the complement is
bound by the subject of ‘to want’ (whether indicated by a classifier as in
851a or by an overt personal pronoun as in 851b).
R E L A T IV E C L A U S E S :In 1030, page 392, the subject of the relative clause, indicated by i ‘self’,
is coreferential with the subject of the main clause.
In 539, the three cases o f i ‘self’ refer to the subject o f the main clause.
The two that are underlined indicate the subjects o f subordinate clauses;
the other (in the first word) is part of a possessive pronoun:
(539) Ih n e im u jtatsón e im flleebe dihne iujcune.

self-(0) self lose-cause
-(event) want-(SgM)
[ti?-pè i mxkhm ]-nè your-(0) self obtain -(0)
‘Having caused the loss of his own, he wants to get yours.’
We now turn to cases in which the anaphor is the modifier (possessor)
in a genitive construction. In 540a the anaphor i ‘self’ modifies (possesses)
©2012 SIL International ®8.3. THE ANAPHOR I ‘SELF’239‘house’ and refers to the sentence’s subject (John). By contrast, in 540b
the personal pronoun ti-:pie must refer to someone outside o f this domain,
that is, someone other than John:
(5 4 0 ) a. Jóaa p ee ihjyavu.
b. Jóaa p éé dffbyé ja vu .hóaa phé:-?i
John go-(t)a. i?

house-goalb. ti-ip’e
ha-§m
that-(SgM) house-goala. ‘John* went to his* house.’
b. ‘Johnj went to hisj house, (i = j ) ’
And i ‘self’ behaves as an anaphor when it is part of a free possessive
pronoun. For example, i?pe ‘self’s (thing)’ must refer to something pos­
sessed by the referent of a nearby expression,one close enough to bind
the anaphor. In 564, page 248, it refers to the sentence’s subject.
Although i ‘self’ behaves like a typical anaphor in the majority of cases,
some cases are unexpected. For example, in 541 it refers to the subject of
the sentence, but that subject is outside o f the immediate clause o f the
anaphor:
(541) Jóaa w aajacu foohffbye ds+j+véne.

teihï^é ]-nè
John know-(t)
self
dog-(SgM) die
-(0)
‘John* knows that his* dog died.’
Example 542 is perhaps even more problematic. Generally anaphors must
be coreferential to a noun phrase that is in a structurally more prominent
position. However, in 542 i refers from within the subject to the direct
object, which presumably is not more prominent:
(542) Io o h ffb ye Jóaake thdóhi.

hóa:-khè
ï?tó-?i
self
dog-(SgM) John-objAn bite-(t)‘John*’s dog bit himj.’Technically, the binding expression should c-command the anaphor. Fur­
ther, subjects generally c-command objects, but objects do not c-command
subjects. This may be evidence that Bora has a “ flat” structure, one lacking
a verb phrase. However, this raises other questions beyond the scope of
this grammar. We leave the question as an outstanding research issue.","[271, 272, 273]"

(contrary-to-fact)’ (CF). Their underlying assumptions are: (1) the truth of
the main clause depends crucially3 on the truth o f the conditional clause,
(2) the conditional clause is false, and (3) therefore the main clause is
false.
The verb of the main clause always bears -i ‘future’ and -ra ~ -ro ‘frus­
trative, contraexpectation’.4 For example:
(974) U majchoca tsuuca u ts+jpanuiyahi.
[m maxtfho 1-kha tehm:kha m tehixphanm-i-ja-?i

Note that the order of the main and subordinate clauses is reversed in
977:
3This is generally a causal dependence.
4This requirem ent— that the main verb bear both the future and the frustrative (contra­
expectation) suffixes— negates the future possibility o f the event o f the main clause, thereby
givin g the counterfactual meaning.","[405, 406]"
"Discussion follows. However, we will leave open various questions
about the phonemic status of certain sounds: (1) Which palatalized con­
sonants are allophones o f the corresponding nonpalatalized consonant?
Some instances are probably allophones while others are phonemes in
their own right. (2) Is [?] an allophone o f /?/, with which it is in complementary distribution? (3) Is [x] an allophone o f /h/, with which it is in
complementary distribution?
/p/ (orthographic b) and /ph/ (orthographic p) differ by aspiration, as in
the following pair:
(19) a. phè:pè (peébe) ‘he goes’
b. pé:pèé (béébeé) ‘the new one’
/t/ (orthographic d) and / tV (orthographic t) differ by aspiration, as in
the following pair:
(20) a. ta:$hi (daachi) ‘his son’
b. t^a:$è (taalle) ‘ she cries’
/te/ (orthographic ds) and /teh/ (orthographic ts) differ by aspiration, as
in the following pair:
(21) a. te4tehïihï (ts+ts++j+) ‘white button’
b. tei:teïhï (ds++ds+j+) ‘coin’
©2012 SIL International ®34CHAPTER 2. PHONOLOGY/$/ (orthographic II) and /$h/ (orthographic ch) differ by aspiration, as
in the following pairs:
(22) a. ^hémè:pè (chémeébe) ‘he is sick’
b. $é:nè:pè (llééneébe) ‘he eats fruit’
(23) a. i$hi: (fchii) ‘here’
b. i$ii (flln) ‘his/her son’
/$h/ (orthographic ch) contrasts with /tjh/ (orthographic ty), as in 24:
(24) a. aa^hi (aachi) ‘outside’
b. a:tihè (aatye) ‘those’
/k/ (orthographic g) and /kh/ (orthographic c before a, o or u but k before
e, i or +) differ by aspiration, as in 25:
(25) a. ko:khómè
(goocóme) ‘they laugh’
b. k^a?kmnmkho (cahgunuco) ‘cahuana (starch drink)’
c. k4khi:hjè
(kfkijjye)
‘bat’
/kp/ (orthographic w) is a voiceless labial-velar stop, as in 26:
(26) a. kpa?aro
(waharo)
‘mother’
b. ó kpa:hakhm-?i (ó waajacuhi) ‘I know-(t)’
There are interesting restrictions on /kp/ (w). First, it only occurs
before /a/ or /m/ (u). Second, it never undergoes palatalization (see
section 2.4.2). For example, we expect palatalization after /i/ but
that does not happen with /kp/: imiwu imikpm ‘very good’. Third,
generally neither /?/ (h) nor /V (j) (preaspiration) may precede /kp/,
but a long vowel may, as in è:-kpa (that-(slab)) and imia:-kpa (proper(slab)).
_ _
/^/ (orthographic v) is a voiced labial fricative, as in 27:
(27) a. ré§ó:§è-:pè (révóóveébe) ‘he turns around’
b. §aha:§è
(vajaave)
‘to become punctured’
/h/ (orthographic j ) may occur as the onset o f a syllable, at the beginning
of a word, as in 28a, or in the middle of a word, as in 28b:
(28) a. haa
i]aa)
‘house’
b. kpa:hakhm (waajacu) ‘know’
/*/ (orthographic j ) is preaspiration. It occupies the coda o f the syllable
before an aspirated consonant (see section 2.4.3), as in 29a, or it may
be word final as in 29b:2
(29) a. ma*fho
(majcho)
‘food’
b. max$hóhmx (majchójuj) ‘eat (hurriedly)’
/V in the syllable coda is pronounced with greater friction than is
/h/ in the onset.
2Since x is in com plem entary distribution w ith /h/ it m ight be considered an allophone
o f /h/.","[67, 68]"
"19.3Ellipsis and gappingIn a sufficiently rich context much of a sentence may be ellipsed, even the
verb. For example, in answer to the question in 1062, one could answer

Processes
The following are speculations about how some forms may have developed
from earlier stages of the language:
1. Two suffixes have the form
One is glossed as ‘become’ (as in
137); the other is glossed as ‘singular intransitive (sin)’ (as in 242).
These are at least cognate; perhaps they are a single morpheme with
two uses.
2. imipax$ho ‘fix’ may derive from *imi-pa-$ho (good-verbalizer-caus).
Likewise, i?hjm§a ‘talk’ may derive from *i?hm-§a mouth-verbalizer and
mxkha§a ‘become fat’ from *mxkha-§a- fat-verbalizer.
3. imihjm ‘happy’ may derive from *imi-hjm (good-speech); e.g., imihjm:§é-mè ‘they became very happy’.
4. ïmi^’é- ‘finish’ may derive from imi-^ié- (good-verbalizer). (However
ïmi^’é- is a transitive verb, whereas
generally derives intransitive
verbs.)
5. i kpahjamm ‘his clothes’ may derive from i kpa-ha-mm (self (slab)(shelter)-pl), perhaps because the body is perceived as roughly slabshaped (like a plank).
6. Perhaps the /pa/ of -khopa ‘ augment’ is cognate with pha- ‘all, big’.
7. maxf ho ‘eat (bread)’ may derive from *mai-teho- (bread-cause), with the
/*i/ palatalizing the /ts/. Support for this is found in the word ma?o
‘cassava bread’.
8. phi:^iè ‘grow’ may derive from phi-:§e. The *phi would have been ei­
ther ‘body’ or ‘big’; the *-:§£ would have been either the verbalizer©2012 SIL Int4flrïktional ®412APPENDIX B. SPECULATIONS ON DIACHRONIC PROCESSES‘become’ or ‘sin’ (which, as suggested above, may have been the same
morpheme).
9. -na:akha ‘meanwhile’ may derive from *-ne-a:kha ( ( 0} -realize). This may
be due to either a historical or a morphophonemic process.
10. -? ixkjha1 ‘be’ forms a compound tense indicating imperfective aspect.
It is frequently interpreted as habitual. It is now bound but was undoubtedly free at some prior stage of the language.
11. -tehi (not palatalized) ~ -^hi (palatalized) (place} and -?m$e (yonder}
~
(root) ‘yonder, over there’ are probably cognate.
12. Consider the requirement that, when -§m ‘goal’ follows an animate
phrase, the phrase must bear the suffix -(?)ti ‘animate’, as in example
656, page 276. This suffix, which now appears to mark animacy, may
have arisen from the pronoun ti ‘that’ in locational uses o f the genitive
construction along the lines of
in example 660, page 276.
13. tehi:me ‘children’ may derive from tehi:-me (baby-ANPL) where tehi:- is
cognate with the classifier -tehi (baby}.
14. The /hm/ o f
Ohmkho: ‘now, already; focus’ may be cognate with
the /hm/ o f -Ohm-x ‘quick-vocative’.
15. -?i (t}, the tracé left when a subject is moved to before the verb, may
be cognate with i ‘self’.
16. mi: ‘two’ may be cognate with -mm ‘dual’ as in -mmtehi (DuM} and
-mmphi (DuF}.
17. -naa(:kha) ‘while’ (discussed in section 17.3 may be derived from -ne
(event} and the adverbial clitic -ha(:ca) ‘realize’ (listed in 11.2).
18. The pronoun mmm ‘indefinite animate singular’ discussed in section
14.3.2 may be cognate with -mm ‘plAn’.
19. The suffix - O O teha ‘each’ is probably cognate with the root teha- ‘one’.
20. See footnote 11, page 106, regarding probable source of certain verbs
often used in compounds.
21. See chapter 15, footnote 2, regarding the possible historical development o f an interrogative suffix that docks a high tone on the host’s final
syllable and causes the final vowel to change from /e/ to /a/.","[439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446]"

The genitive construction joins two nouns or noun phrases into a single
noun phrase.
[ nP NPmodifierNhead ]The meaning is generally that o f “ possession,” in which the first noun
(phrase) “ possesses” the second. (We often refer to the modifier as the
POSSESSOR and the head as the POSSESSED. The modifier (possessor) pre­
cedes the head (possessed) with the tones described in section 9.1. The
modifier may cliticize to the head or it may be a separate word (or phrase).","[282, 283, 284, 285]"

the direct object and the direct object becomes a goal.

stood that the referents o f the subject caused each other to do the action
indicated by the verb; for example:

reflects the fact that most speakers o f the Ineje dialect apply a rule w h ereby -teko becomes
-te^a b efore -mèi.","[179, 180]"
"5.9.1The present-past tenseThe unmarked tense of Bora verbs is present-past (realis). These do not
distinguish past (prior) events from present ones, that is events happening
at the time of speaking. Whether past or present is intended be inferred
from context. For example, in answer to “What is your brother doing?”
266 would be understood as ‘He is working’ but in answer to “What did
your brother do yesterday?” it would be understood as ‘He worked’:
(266)kpakhimjèi-:piè (Wakimyenbye.)
«JJewraked’18'
work-(SgM)

Of course, the time reference may be made explicit by a time adverb, such
as i:hjm ‘yesterday’ in 267:

‘My brother worked

verb will happen subsequent to the time o f speaking. Future tense is
marked by the addition o f the future morpheme at the position indicated
in figure 5.2, page 135. This morpheme has two forms, which are briefly
described and illustrated here; for further discussion see appendix D, page
429, item 1110.
First, when a suffix other than - © © ?i (t) follows, the future morpheme
is -i.19 For example, consider 268b (in which -©$è (SgF) follows the future
suffix):
19 This m orpheme and the “ projected tim e” clitic discussed in section 5.9.3.3 may be one
and the same m orpheme but w e treat them separately because -i ‘future’ occurs on ly on
verbs (a distributional d ifferen ce) and never has the additional syllable /:ki l è/ as does the
“ projected tim e” clitic (a form al difference).",[183]

1. It seems that Bora does not have a stress system aside from the system
of tone. We do not discount the possibility that Bora’s tone system is
a stress system implemented on tone. See note 8, page 98 for further
discussion.
2. Throughout this grammar we make observations about quantity sensitive phenomena but we have no theory about these. We understand
little about vowel length, particularly when the length of certain mor­
phemes will surface and when not. For example, we do not know why
pha-mè-:rè (all-(AnPl}-only) ‘only all o f them (AnPl)’ has length while
pha-mé-§a-fè (all-(AnPl}-plQ-only) ‘only all o f them (AnPl)’ does not.
And we are unsure as to what constitutes a heavy versus a light syllable.
3. An attempt to define Bora foot structure has yielded no definite answers. For example, it is unclear whether the FOOT should be defined
in terms of syllable weight or tone (which is not unreasonable if the
tonal system were really an accentual system implemented on tone).
As working hypotheses we might assume that (1) heavy syllables are
those that end with x, ? o r :, (2) the foot is a left-headed trochee, and (3)
feet are assigned from left to right. (Since a phrase may begin or end
with either a heavy or a light syllable, we must have degenerate feet.)
4. In one case (and only one that we know of) the case marker -thm ‘source’
is not aspirated, namely when it follows the classifier -tehi (place}: atehi-?tjm-§a-a (thm-(place}-sou-rpt-rem) ‘from that place (long ago, it is
said)’. We do not know why.","[86, 87]"
"©2012 SIL International ®1.6. RELIGION1.619ReligionRelatively little is known about traditional Bora religion. The chief,
Mibeco, said that the evil thunder god splits trees from top to bottom
with lightning, and then plants the life o f a new animal in the ground. In
this way, the wild and dangerous animals of the rain forest were created.
Many o f these animals, especially the jaguar, were believed to have spe­
cial powers, which could harm people, or which could protect a clan. If
the latter, the animal in question was not killed or eaten by members of
that clan, and the clan’s shaman claimed that that animal gave him spe­
cial power.13 The Bora did not worship such animals but respected them
for their powers. They made appeasement offerings to the spirits of some
animals. (This is also true o f one type o f tree, for which an offering was
made before it was cut down.)
The shaman still follows these beliefs and employs the teeth of the
jaguar to adversely affect others: he is said to cause the swelling o f knee
joints, with an eventual, very painful death. Several deaths in 1953 were
attributed to such shamanistic practice.
While most Bora no longer observe the practices of the traditional reli­
gion, they still have a great fear o f the shaman’s powers. The shaman was,
perhaps, the most powerful man in Bora culture. He was feared, and was
always paid for his assistance. Cultural change has diminished his power.
With medicines available at the Posta Medica or from outsiders, the people
call on the shaman less frequently.
It was the custom in the old days for the shaman to assign babies a protective totem, usually one o f the following: dove, hummingbird, partridge,
parrot, stork, panguano, partridge, paca, agouti.14 Each person expected to
receive help from his totem. This naming practice and belief has declined
due to the conversion o f many Bora people to Christianity.
In 1984 or 1985 a six-year-old boy was caught in the claws o f a jaguar
of the type known as colorado.15 When the father came running with his
shotgun, the jaguar was distracted, enabling the boy to get away. The
father fired his only shell, but missed. The jaguar ran a short way off. After
13Several years ago a man livin g at the mouth o f the Sumun River was reported to have
claim ed ownership o f the huangana, the peccary lacking the w hite stripe across its shoulder.
He claim ed to be able to talk to them when they came to his house. He demanded that
hunters pay him when they killed one, or otherwise suffer the consequences.
14These animals w ere regarded as good, w h ile the deer, collared peccary (sajino), whitelipped peccary (huangana), tapir (sachavaca), ow l, bat, and certain other animals w ere re­
garded as evil. The shaman also w orked w ith the pow er o f the evil animals.
15This is about tw o feet high, four feet long, o f a reddish brow n color (w ithou t spots).","[52, 53]"

on the roof with long poles, thus staging a mock attack. Upon entering,
they bargained and exchanged their meats for the other foods that were
supplied by the hosts. The meat included peccaries, tapirs, monkeys, birds,
and large, live grubs and worms. The food provided by the host was bread
made from bitter manioc, a pure starch drink (cahuana), peanuts, a thick
pineapple drink, and pijuayo drink (none of which was fermented).
One or two couples were busy all day and all night singing a song of
thanksgiving for the food. The song included a line telling the people to
take, eat, and drink of this food, which was their life sustenance. They sang
in harmony, in a rather harsh voice, but beautifully. After each singing,
the pot was refilled and passed to the next person to drink.
One reason for the festival was the name-changing ceremony. As is
customary, the chieftainship is passed to the son after the death of the
chief. However, long before the chief dies, a festival is carried out to pass
the chief’s name to his successor. In the case o f this particular festival, the
grandson was given the name of the father, and the father the name o f the
grandfather, who is still the chief.
Also, the chief’s eight-year-old daughter received the name of a deceased aunt. The girl was painted black from head to foot, and wore a blue
and white beaded girdle with a fringe of shells. She had rings o f white cotton around her legs and arms, along with bracelets, anklets, necklaces, and
earrings. The Bora ordinarily paint black around their mouths, their eyebrows, and sometimes their cheeks. For this occasion many of the girls, as
well as women, had the typical Bora design painted all over their bodies;
see plate 85 of Steward (1948), following page 762.
After the name-changing ceremony, which consisted o f much chanting,
the dancing resumed. This time the chief’s family held hands and led a
group that danced for a time around the women. Then they formed the
front row for the completion of the dance. Some o f these dancers wore
nut rattles on their ankles; these greatly accentuated the rhythm.
The singing and dancing continued all day. At about 8 P.M . the singing
changed to a song o f insult to the chief, who— they said— had not prepared
enough food. This song lasted for a couple o f hours and throughout the
song they were eating and drinking as much as they could to get rid of all
the food.
The chief, who was sitting in a circle with his council, was merely grinning and continued chewing his coca and tobacco juice. It was apparent
that this was the people’s ironie way of complimenting him on a very fine
festival. He seemed very pleased that everyone was having a good time.
The guests went home at 4 o ’clock Sunday morning, tired but satisfied.

an outsider (and his family) exploited the labor of a group o f people in
exchange for assuming certain responsibilities for them. The patrón gave
cloth, kettles, blankets, and other goods on credit. To pay for this the men
were required to go into the rain forest to gather chicle, rosewood, and
other raw materials. Upon paying, they were given more goods so as to
keep them constantly in debt. The patrón kept basic medical supplies for
the people. He organized soccer games for the people, but not schools.
And he prohibited other outsiders from going to where the Bora people
lived (on the pretext that they would “ bother” them).
The Bora in Peru persisted under this system for about forty years after
being brought to Peru by the Loayza family.9
When they learned simple mathematics, the Bora people began to question the value of the exchanges made with their patrones and their chiefs.
Men became less willing to leave their families to work in the rain forest
gathering rosewood and chicle. However, when the patrón would bring
trade items (machetes, axes, kettles, yard goods for mosquito nets and for
clothing, blankets, hair clips, and beads) they were eager to take these
items on credit; they then had to go to work in the rain forest to pay for
them. Working for a patrón was a form of security. He took care of them,
provided basic medicines, and protected them from outside exploitation.
Forty years after the demise of the patrón system many Bora people still
find it difficult to be independent. They want to be in debt to someone
who will provide security for them.
The patrones were able to keep river traders away from the people for
a time, but were eventually no longer able to do so. When the traders
came in, they brought liquor, which has become a disruptive factor in
the communities. The people, however, discourage traders because they
want everything on credit and often manage not to pay when the trader
returns to collect their bananas and other products. The sale o f skins of
wild boar, jaguar, and ocelot are now controlled by the government, so
traders can no longer count on making a profit on these. Therefore, it is
now often necessary for the Bora to travel downstream to Pebas to buy
supplies. The chief, the teachers, or anyone else with cash may bring back
soap, kerosene, or liquor to sell in the town. At one point a store was
set up in Brillo Nuevo. It prospered until the storekeeper began to sell on
credit; thereafter he was soon forced out o f business. The attitude o f the
9W e do not know h ow long they m ight have lived under the patrón system in Colombia
before being brought to Peru.","[43, 44, 45]"
"Why is Bora so interesting?
The Bora phonology is rich in nonsegmental phenomena. There is an elaborate tone system, intimately tied to both the lexicon and the grammar.
(An entire chapter is dedicated to tone, and it is discussed in virtually
every chapter.) Various phenomena are sensitive to syllable weight, and
perhaps conditioned by foot structure.
Morphologically, Bora is fairly agglutinative. There are many suffixes
and few— if any— prefixes. Many apparent prefixes are proclitics.
Typologically, Bora is an OV language. Evidence for this claim is as
follows:
1. Both Subject-Object-Verb and Object-Subject-Verb are common
word orders. Predicate complement clauses generally have Complement-Subject-Verb order.
2. There are postpositions, e.g., in the locative construction, but no prepositions.
3. In the genitive construction the possessor precedes the possessed.
4. Adjectives may precede the nouns they modify but it is more common
for the modifier to follow the head in an appositive phrase. (This is a
consequence o f the role played by the classifiers in forming referring
expressions.)
5. Auxiliary verbs follow the semantically main verb (which is structurally
subordinate to the auxiliary verb); see, for example, section 4.3.6.
Bora has a strong case system implemented by suffixes. There is an
interesting animacy-controlled inversion o f the direct object and recipient
(goal).
Perhaps the most outstanding feature of Bora grammar is the presence
o f a large number of classifiers and the various ways they are exploited in
carrying out reference. Strikingly, apposition— not constituency— is the
primary “ glue” for creating referring expressions.
In forming discourses, Bora has a remarkable system o f sentential con­
nectives, one that exploits the classifiers to provide great intersentential
cohesion.

THE INDEX:In the index, entries are ordered according to the English alphabet. Bora
words are written according to the Bora writing system (the “ practical
orthography”) to facilitate finding them in alphabetical order.
EXAMPLES:Examples generally present four types of information. The position of
these parts varies in the interest o f saving space. (1) The Bora example is
written in a phonetic or phonemic form using the International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA). (2) The example is also written in the Bora writing
system, with this sort o f font (sans serif). This is sometimes located
above the phonetic / phonemic representation and sometimes following
the phonetic / phonemic form (in parentheses). (3) A
morpheme-by-morpheme gloss is given either below the Bora example or
in parentheses following it. (4) A free translation follows, either on a line
below the morpheme-by-morpheme text or following it at the end o f the
line.
BORA C ITATIO N FORMS:(a) Words given “ in isolation” (i.e., without any preceding or following
text) may meet the conditions for the application of either PLTS or FLTS.
If so, the isolation form will be the output o f the rule (which is how it
would be pronounced in isolation). (b) Sometimes the phonetic /
phonemic representation of words, roots, affixes,...make lexically
©2012 SIL International ®Conventionsx x x iiimarked tones explicit, as discussed below, while omitting the tones of
other syllables. (c) When verbs are cited, the phonetic / phonemic
representation may make lexically marked tones explicit whereas the
orthographic form gives the nonfinite form; see section 4.1, page 100,
especially figure 4.1. For example, akpakhumrn (awacunu) ‘to yawn’.
PHRASE MARKERS:Phrase markers ( “ trees”) with which structure is represented are
intended as suggestive, neither definitive nor what would might be
expected for any particular theoretic perspective. Some sentences are
given with a rather flat structure. This makes it easier to deal with Bora’s
relatively free word order, but at the cost o f sometimes obscuring
subcategorization relationships. For example, see the tree given for
example 662, page 277. Some affixes are treated as separate syntactic
constituents; for example, case markers are treated as postpositions.
TONE DERIVATIONS:The Bora forms in tone derivations are written as Bora people normally
read and write their language. Tone derivations use the font with
which this sentence is written.
LETTERS REPRESENTING USES OF TONE:We sometimes use v to highlight a high tone and v to highlight a low
tone. Further, to help the reader keep track of different uses o f tone, we
sometimes indicate the use by writing a small letter over the vowel.
These letters are as follows:

mi- does not refer to a canoe; rather, it means quite generally ‘trans­
portation’. However, it does refer to a canoe when combined with -nè
(0), which (1) satisfies the structural requirement for a head, and (2) de­
notes a class o f objects, thus enabling the phrase to refer.12
5. It might be possible to formulate an argument against the claim that
classifiers head their phrases based on the remarkable behavior of clas­
sifiers with numeral phrases.
When a numeral phrase is used to quantify a noun, that noun must agree
in animacy, gender and number. For example, consider 478, page 218.
The phrase that means ‘six’ ends with an animate, singular, masculine
classifier because ‘ six’ is literally ‘one from this hand’. When this phrase
quantifies a noun (phrase), it must agree in animacy, number and gen­
der. Thus, in ‘six dogs’— contrary to what one might expect— ‘dogs’ is
marked as singular and masculine. See section 7.7.2 for further discussion. However, this lends further support for the claim that classifiers
head their phrases. What matters are the features of the the numeral
phrase and the noun, which are precisely the features of the classifiers
with which each ends. That is, the classifiers determine the features of
their phrase, even though these features do not reflect the semantics of
the expression.
To conclude this section (6.3), it should be clear that Bora classifiers
are eminently nominal. Here we have made a stronger claim: that Bora
classifiers are nouns. By doing so, it follows that Bora classifiers should
share the major properties o f nouns: the types o f meanings they encode,
the grammatical functions they may have, their distribution/use, and so
forth. Indeed, they do except that they have a more restricted distribu­
tion than other nouns. And this restricted distribution is due to a simple
property: that they are bound.
Based on the claim that Bora classifiers are nouns, it seems reasonable
to think that what have been called “ classifiers” in Bora are not really
such, but simply a subclass o f nouns. We will not try to resolve this issue
here because the answer depends on whether one believes in universal
category definitions or that ultimately each category must be defined for
each language.","[221, 222]"

b. ‘After having fixed it, he carried (it) off.’
Both types of -ne are present in mèkha?khmxtehónè mèimipai^éné in figure
16.5; this is a subordinate clause which has a subordinate adverbial clause
within it:7 The adverbial clause bears -ne (event) while the clause in which
it is embedded bears -ne (0). (The tone o f the proclitics is explained in
section 3.12.2, page 93.)
5The distinction corresponds closely to w hat Langacker calls objects and interactions; he
writes (Langacker 1991:183):
Conceptually, objects and interactions present a maxim al contrast, having opposite values for such properties as dom ain o f instantiation (space vs. tim e),
essential constituent (substance vs. energy transfer), and the possibility o f
conceptualizing one independently o f the other (autonomous vs. dependent).
Physical objects and energetic interactions provide the respective prototypes
for the noun and verb categories, w hich likew ise represent a polar opposition
am ong the basic gram m atical classes.
6The crucial syllable is the host’s penult, which must not be the initial syllable because
for both suffixes the host’s initial syllable bears the subordination high tone.
7This example is taken from (Thiesen et aL 1982).",[399]
"©2012 SIL International ®8.1. PERSONAL PRONOUNS235sPPthat-(SgM )NPVhouseFigure 8.1 STR: example 531
Thus, the choice between a personal pronoun and the anaphor may be determined by the (structural) distance to the pronoun’s coreferent: a pro­
noun if sufficiently far, the anaphor if sufficiently close.
Second, in some cases the choice between indicating a sentence’s sub­
ject with an overt personal pronoun, as opposed to using a classifier on the
verb, is determined by structural factors. For example, when a sentence is
negated with teha?(a) and -thm ‘neg’ an overt pronoun (or noun phrase) is
required, but if it is negated (contrastively) with -hi:(§a) ‘deny’, a classifier
subject is used; see section 13.3, particularly examples 850 and 851.
However, more generally the choice is determined by the issue o f topic
continuity:
continuity: A classifier subject on the verb is generally used when the
subject remains the same, as in the second and third sentences of
1043, page 398. Continuity can also be maintained by making the
subject a thematic connective, as in 1041, page 398.
©2012 SIL International ®236CHAPTER 8. PRONOUNSdiscontinuity: Shifting the subject from the currently most topical ref­
erent to another possible referent generally requires using an overt
pronoun or noun phrase. See, for example, the set in 1054-1056,
page 401. A special case o f this is to reestablish a topic that was
earlier put aside; see section 19.1.4.
Continuity is generally more frequent than discontinuity, so subjects are
more frequently indicated with a classifier than with an overt pronoun.","[268, 269, 270]"
"10.3.1GoalWhen a clause refers to some trajectory through space, the GOAL (i.e., the
end point o f the trajectory) may be indicated by a noun phrase bearing

end point of the trajectory along which the patient/theme moves). For
these verbs, the patient/theme becomes the direct object, marked with
-khe (-ke) and the goal is marked with
(-vu) ‘goal’, as represented in
figure 10.2 and illustrated in 661.

There are two ways we might think o f this. On the one hand, we might
regard kpathaxkho ‘cover’ as a transitive verb that subcategorizes for a direct
object, the object covered. On this view, ?joxtehi ‘hand’ would be regarded
as an adjunct that bears
(-v u ) ‘theme’ because it is the thing that
moves. This is the first alternative presented in figure 10.4. On the other
hand, we might regard kpathaxkho ‘cover’ as subcategorizing for both a
theme and a goal. If one expects the goal to be marked with
(-v u )
‘goal’ and the theme as a direct object, then the actual case marking would
require inversion, as represented in the second alternative o f figure 10.4.

We withhold judgement on this case. However, there is a case where an
inversion analysis is motivated for Bora.8 The verb axkhm (a jcu ) ‘give’ (and
perhaps a few other verbs) presents the recipient (goal) as the direct object
and marks the theme (that which passes from the giver to the recipient)
with
(-v u ) ‘goal/theme’; this is represented in figure 10.5:

o f the preceding syllable. This form, tiip’è, occurs when N O T at the end of

sometimes it is individual versus collective action, sometimes it is a single

When heading an adverbial clause, verbs so formed may be followed
by an adverbial suffix, and when heading a relative clause or nominal
complement, they may be followed by a case marker; see figure 16.1, page
357. In all cases clitics may follow.
Second, imperative verbs are formed as indicated in figure 5.3.

There are distinct types of verbs, as discussed in section 5.7.
Tense (locating an event relative to the time o f speaking) is discussed
in section 5.9.
Aspect (the nature o f the event’s unfolding in time, i.e., whether it is
presented as occurring in an instant, as ongoing, as a persistent state,...)
is inherent in verb stems. Verb roots are frequently followed by a “ sin­
gle versus multiple action” suffix that— to some extent— defines the verb’s
aspect; see section 5.7.2.

to his beliefs or behavior) is indicated in various ways. Imperatives are
discussed in chapter 14. Interrogatives are discussed in chapter 15.
Evidentiality (i.e., the basis on which one knows the information being
communicated) is indicated by clitics; see section 11.1.
Verbs can be modified by adverbs, which may be verbal suffixes
(5.12.1) or independent words (5.12.2).","[167, 168, 169, 170]"
"©2012 SIL International ®Chapter 10Case and Grammatical
Relations
Case marking suffixes indicate the role o f a noun phrase (or subordinate
clause) with respect to the clause within which it occurs. Bora has the
following case markers: -0 ‘nominative’ for subjects ( 10.1), -khe ~ 0 (with
animate and inanimate phrases, respectively) ‘direct object’ ( 10.2),
‘goal’ or ‘theme’ (10.3), -thm ‘source’ (10.4), -fi ‘inanimate obliques’ (10.5),
-ma ‘with’ (10.6), and -$i:?è ‘motive’ (10.7). In addition to these, there are
two “ pseudo-cases”: -?tm ‘comparative’ (10.8) and -x ‘vocative’ (10.9).
Some of the case-marking alternatives are illustrated in 625. 625a has
a singular transitive verb whereas 625b-d have an intransitive verb.

"©2012 SIL International ®5.4. END OF M AIN VERB MARKERS5.4131End of main verb markersWhen a main clause has a preverbal subject, the verb is followed by - © © ?i
(t) (5.4.1) or - © ©ne (n) (5.4.2).85.4.1 -hi ~ -h (t)
The morpheme - © © ? (i) (t) is suffixed to the verb o f the main clause, as
in 229:
(229) A vyéju u b e ihajkimuke n éé d itye ihjya nmibajchoki.

ï? hja

imipax$ho-khi
self house self fix-pur
‘The chief told his people to fix his9 house.’
This suffix occurs only with explicit preverbal subjects, as in 230a. It does
not co-occur with a classifier subject, as in the first alternative in 230b:
(230) a. ï:hm mmï§a-?i (I+ju um+va.) ‘The horse escaped.’
horse escape-(t)
*mmi§a-:pé-?i{I(p f ^ (t) | (Um+vaabe.) ‘He escaped.’escape-(SgM)Nor does it occur in negative clauses; such cases are discussed in the next
section.
The suffix - © © ? (i) (t) imposes a low tone on its host’s penult:
(231) a. ó $e:né-?i (ó lleen éh i) ‘I eat (fruit).’
b. ó i?§èthé-?i (ó th v e té h i) ‘I stop.’
8A theory that entertains some notion o f m ovem ent m ight consider (t) and (n ) to be
“ tracés” o f subjects that have been m oved to a preverbal position. This could be m otivated
by the follo w in g distributional facts: (1 ) (t) and (n ) never co-occur w ith a classifier subject,
presumably because they occupy the position o f classifier subjects, and (2 ) (t) and (n ) occur
i f and on ly i f there is an overt preverbal subject (pronoun, name, or noun phrase).
9This could also refer to “ their” house, i.e., it could be bound by the indirect object rather
than the subject o f the higher clause. The interpretation given in 229 is preferred because
‘house’ is singular. If, how ever, the object w ere plural, that is i ’ Wa ?apè (s e lf house various)
‘his/their various houses’, then the favored interpretation w ou ld be ‘ their houses’ .","[164, 165]"

as the one glossed (0). This would be the case if negative clauses were
complements to a negative verb (one which time has robbed of most verbal
responsibilities and privileges). This would not only explain the presence
of -ne, but also the fact that the initial syllable o f the verb o f negative
clauses bears high tone. For example, 236 above would structurally be
the following:

subordinate clause terminated with - © ©ne (0). Presumably this clause
is the predicate complement o f an implicit verb be, the implicit subject of
which is something like fact. The first sentence of 239 illustrates this type
o f sentence:

To this point we have not discussed -ne’s tonal properties. -ne (event)
seems to ( 1) impose a high tone on the host’s initial syllable and ( 2) delink
low tones between itself and the initial syllable, thereby making them high:
# @ ...-hne. However, it is not necessary to specify that -ne imposes the
initial high tone provided we recognize that the main verbs o f all sub­
ordinate clauses bear high tones on their first syllables, as indicated by
# @ ...-hne ‘subordinate’ in the tone derivation of i kpa:hakhm-hmkhó:-nè
in figure 16.6. Further, note that the low tone borne by -juco (:) ‘now’
is delinked but not the © that it imposes on the host’s penult. (Unfortunately, at this point we can not say which low tones -ne (event) fails to
delink.)

Is there any sense in which the sensory verb complement in 963a is less an
event than the adverbial clauses in 963b and c? (Here tone does not help
because the verb is too short.) The generalization seems to be this: When
a subordinate clause is headed by -ne and is a direct object, then this -ne is
- © ©ne (0). This—we assume— is the result o f subcategorization; that is,
verbs like axtjhmmi ‘see’ in 963a subcategorize for a complement headed
by - © ©ne (0). If this is correct, the tone difference is due to a syntactic
condition, not a semantic difference.
Returning now to the -ne (n) that follows -© thm ‘negative’ (mentioned
at the very start of this section), it may be desirable to identify this with
- © ©ne (0). There are two reasons. First, the tone is consistent; indeed
the © imposed by -thm may actually be the © imposed by - © ©ne (0).
Second, this is consistent with the suggestion that negative clauses are
subordinate clauses.","[399, 400, 401]"
