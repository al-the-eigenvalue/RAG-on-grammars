the licensing relationship between that head and a weak pronoun.

Principle and how its requirements are fulfilled in Zuni constructions with no apparent
structural subject.",[135]
"Thus perhaps while there may be little directly observableevidence for V-movementin Zuni, we can perhaps ultimately be able to assume V-movementon the basis of the indirect evidencethe analysisitself will suggest,ifcompelling enough.

I consider the parameterization of the EPP vs. the alternative that anobject inside the VP somehow satisfies the EPP in Zuni.,[135]
It is suggested that languages range from more to less opaque in themapping from semantics to syntax and that Zuni sits at the transparent end of this crosslinguistic scale.,[9]

!44 145144 Sigurdsson (1992) argues for a variation on Marantz's analysis, namely that NPs do not raise for case

features. In other words, chains must combine or be visibly distinct, Structurally or featurally.’145 The issues are not necessarily this simple. For example, some languages may allow either movementor the insertion of an expletive subject (cf. Icelandic examples (21a) and (22) in Section 3.2.1.3), or
insertion of expletive subjects in a variety of constructions (transitives, unaccusatives, and/or unergatives

expletive constructions are restricted to unaccusative intransitives in some languages but yet in otherlanguages allowed in a variety of intransitive construction types. The issue is further complicated by the157Similarly, other evidence held to confirm Burzio's Generalization can be shown to
