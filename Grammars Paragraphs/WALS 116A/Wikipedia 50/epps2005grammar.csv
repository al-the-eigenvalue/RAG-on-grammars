"17.4.3. Polar questions with focus on constituent
This interrogative strategy is typically used in questions involving a focused constituent,
and is also very common for rhetorical purposes, such as when responding to a speaker
(i.e. a ‘backchanneling’ strategy akin to ‘really?’, ‘is that right?’, ‘uh-huh’, etc. in
English). Its formal organization is essentially like that of the constituent or ‘questionword’ question, but without the initial question word; however, like the predicate-focused
polar questions discussed above, it solicits a yes-no answer. Its constituent order is the
same as that of the typical declarative clause, from which it is formally distinguished by
the presence of the Interrogative Boundary Suffix -V/ (or the unreduced form of the
Future suffix -tég) on the clause-final verb, in place of the Declarative marker -Vêh.
Intonation in these interrogatives tends to peak clause-initially on the focused constituent
(usually a nominal or adverbial), and fall at the end of the clause.
While soliciting a yes-no answer, these questions front a non-predicative
constituent of the clause, which is understood (via this fronting strategy) to be the focus
of the question.194 In many cases, this results in a semi-rhetorical question—i.e. a193Note that word order inversion is attested in Hup constituent questions, but only those involving the
exceptional interrogative verb forms ‘say’ and ‘be like’ (§17.4.1).
194
Note that the strategy of fronting a focused constituent of the clause is common to Hup clauses
generally, not just interrogatives (see §17.3.1).",[966]

Content questions are typically answered with a standard declarative clause, or more
minimally, a single word that provides the particular information solicited. In the case of
yes-no questions, the typical response is the repetition of the verb phrase that appeared in
the interrogative (whether negative or affirmative), in declarative form. Subjects are
frequently dropped. Examples (156-60) illustrate question-answer dyads between two
speakers (A and B).

B)mQndítóg-a‡nBernadito daughter-OBJ‘To Bernadito’s daughter.’ (TD.Cv.105)
The affirmative particle h´‡/ ‘yes, all right’ is also common in response to polar
questions, and can be used either by itself or preceding an affirmative clause. For
example, the response in (161) comes from the story of the Tapir and the Turtle; the956Turtle has questioned the leaves of trees at the places where the Tapir had slept, and
they answer as follows:
(161) h´‡/, n’ít tˆh /çê‚h-çê‚h
yesthere 3sg sleep‘Yes, he slept there.’ (JA.73)
There is no general word for ‘no’ in Hup; however, the negative predicative
particle pãÙ (see §16.2) can be used in response to questions dealing with the presence or
existence of nominal entities:(162) A)hu‡p=d’´hpãÙhˆ¤d?","[970, 971, 972, 973]"

This interrogative subtype solicits a yes/no answer, and is formally quite different
from the content questions. It does not involve a question word, and constituent order is
subject-final rather than verb-final; moreover, this clause-final subject can only be a
pronoun (a fact that is consistent with the de-focused subject in this interrogative clause
type). Also—presumably because there is no clause-final verb—the Interrogative
Boundary Suffix -V/ is not present in this type of question. Crucially, it is the obligatory
lack of the Declarative marker on the subject that defines the clause as an interrogative
rather than a subject-final declarative (see §17.3.1). The clause-medial verb must take a
Boundary Suffix other than Declarative -Vêh or Interrogative -V/, such as the Dynamic,
Future, Negative, or Inchoative. Direct objects usually occur clause-initially; other
objects may either precede the verb or follow it as a tacked-on external argument.
Intonation in polar questions tends to be relatively high throughout the clause
(compared to declarative and other Hup clause types); it is fairly level, but falls slightly at
the end of the clause (as does intonation on constituent questions). The fact that Hup
polar questions in general have a relatively higher intonation than declarative clauses is a
typologically common pattern; even the placement of the higher intonation at the
beginning of the clause rather than at the end is typologically not unusual (cf. Siemund
2001: 1013).","[961, 962]"

(129) wQd-nˆ¤h-ay/ám?eat-NEG-INCH 2sg‘Won’t you eat something?’ (OS)
Emphasis in polar questions can be signaled via the clause-final Focus marker
-áh, as well as the predicative Emphasis form -pog:(130) ham-pog-tégnˆ¤N-áh?!go-EMPH1-FUT 2pl-FOC‘Will/would you really go?!’ (B.Cv.81)
Polar interrogatives involving predicate nominals are typically identity questions,
and are most commonly formed with the ‘intangible’ demonstrative yúp (often yúp=b’ay
in Barriera; yú in Tat Deh):

Perhaps the most frequent use of polar questions is the standard Hup greeting,
which involves asking a question about whatever the addressee is obviously engaged in at
the time. These questions are clearly not really requests for information—the formula
virtually requires the answer to be obvious—but are a conventionalized speech act for the
purpose of social interaction. The standard answer is an affirmative repetition of the verb
phrase (see §17.4.5 below). One of the most conventionalized of these questions is the
standard morning greeting (example 132). Other common greetings are provided in
(136-38); (133) is often said when entering a house where a number of people are948gathered, and (135) is conventionally used to greet a visitor from another community
on his/her arrival in one’s own village. As expected, addressing more than one person
requires the second person plural pronoun nˆ¤N in place of singular /ám, as in (133).
(132) c´w´¤/-´¤y/ám?awake-DYNM 2sg‘Are you awake?’ (OS)
nˆ¤N?(133) ní-íybe-DYNM 2pl‘Are you all here?’ (OS)

(135) nQ¤n-Q¤y/ám?come-DYNM 2sg‘Have you arrived?’ (OS)
Likewise, situation-specific questions regarding the addressee’s current (observable)
activity are perfectly acceptable greetings:
(136) te‡gt´¤/-´¤y/ám?wood light.fire-DYNM 2sg‘Are you lighting a fire?’ (OS)
(137) hQ¤w-Q¤y/ám?scrape-DYNM 2sg‘Are you scraping (manioc)?’ (OS)
The word order inversion strategy used in these predicate-focused polar questions
is undoubtedly the most typologically striking feature of Hup. Such use of word order
inversion in polar questions is common in European languages, but it is relatively
uncommon elsewhere in the world. Moreover, the fact that it is the only interrogative
subtype in Hup to use a word order inversion strategy violates—at least marginally—949Greenberg’s (1966) universal 11, which states that inversion with polar interrogatives
only occurs in those languages which use inversion to mark constituent interrogatives.193
However, inversion in polar questions is restricted in Hup; it involves only pronominal
subjects, and does not occur in constituent-focused polar questions (see §17.4.3 below).","[963, 964, 965, 966]"

While ni- is the main copula verb in Hup, a few other verbs can serve a quasicopular function in certain contexts. In particular, the concept ‘become’ is expressed by
the verb hidoho-, and the verb ham- ‘go’ is also occasionally used in this sense, as with
the nominalized predicate adjective in example (94):(94)yˆ-d’´‡hyúptˆh=páy=d’´hthat.ITG-PL that.ITG 3sg=bad=PLham-ní-h
go-INFR2-DECL‘Those people became bad (i.e. went bad).’ (H.txt.41)17.4. Interrogative clauses
Hup has three main types of interrogative clause, which differ from each other both
formally and functionally. These are constituent or ‘question-word’ questions, polar
(yes-no) questions with emphasis on the predicate, and polar questions with emphasis on
a constituent (typically used in discursive backchanneling). The features that formally
define the interrogative clause vis-à-vis other clause types in Hup are constituent order,
the presence of a question word (interrogative pronoun, demonstrative, or adverbial), andthe presence of the Interrogative suffix -V/, although which of these are present938depends on the subtype of interrogative. Crucially, the Declarative suffix never occurs in
an interrogative clause. Two clause-final particles (ya‡ and ti‡ ) are also used primarily in
interrogatives as discourse tags (see §15.3), and are acceptable with all three subtypes of
interrogative clause. Most verbal inflectional forms are acceptable in interrogative
clauses, including evidentials (see §14.9).19117.4.1. Constituent (question-word) questions
The primary function of constituent or ‘question-word’ questions is to solicit specific
information. The formal organization of these clauses is quite distinct: the clause begins
with a question word (an interrogative pronoun, determiner, or adverbial), and—when a
verbal predicate is present—the clause ends with a verb inflected with the Interrogative
suffix -V/.
The Hup question words are discussed in detail in §6.3 (Table 6.2), and are
summarized in (95) below. With the exception of the interrogative pronoun used
specifically for human referents (/u‡y ‘who’), all of the question words are derived from
the interrogative particle hˆ‚. In addition to appearing as focused constituents in
interrogative predicates, the question words can all stand alone as independent
interrogative utterances.","[954, 955]"

In another discourse-related use, the Emphatic Coordinator =nih is sometimes
used in response to questions, as in example (23)—the response to my asking after
someone’s illness. The Emphatic Coordinator is especially common when providing an
‘it just is’ type of answer, using the ‘no reason’ particle hi); for example, a teenager
answered my question, ‘Why did you leave school?’ with (24). The function of the
Emphatic Coordinator in these instances is not completely clear, but it may serve to link
the response back to the preceding discourse, or even to the question itself.","[995, 996]"

In conversation, =b’ay is in extremely frequent use with interrogative clauses
(both information (WH) and polar (yes-no) types), as illustrated in examples (34-38). As
such, its use is probably motivated by the awareness of multiple possible but contrasting
options vis-à-vis one referent or situation, or (conversely) of multiple possible referents
vis-à-vis one event. It tends to occur clause-finally, in conjunction with clause-final
subjects; by contrast, the verb-final interrogative strategy (see §17.4) rarely involves
marking with =b’ay (although this can occur, as in example 38) below).

In general, all nominal constituents of the main clause can be questioned, whether
they are core or peripheral, as can heads within nouns phrases. For example, while (114)
questions a locative phrase, (115) selects the nominal element within the locative.
(114) hˆ‚ê-có/

(115) hˆ‚ê-n’ˆ‡h g’od-an

On the other hand, locative postpositions cannot themselves be directly questioned:
(116) *cá/ hˆ‚ê-n’ˆ‡h
boxQ-NMZcug’Q‡tní-i/paperbe-INT(Intended meaning: ‘Where in relation to the box is the book?’)
Questions in Hup can involve embedding. For instance, a question word can
occur in a subordinate clause, embedded within an interrogative main clause:
(117) hˆ‚ê-n’ˆ‡h
Q-NMZkéy-ep /am yé-e/ ?
see-DEP 2sgenter-INT‘What did you come in for?’ (lit. ‘what did you come in to see’) (OS)
Also, in quoted speech (see §18.2.1), an interrogative clause can itself be embedded
within a declarative main clause:
(118) hˆ‚ê-n’ˆ‡h
Q-NMZyupg’çê‚h-ç‚/,that.ITG be-INTnç¤-çy/ˆ¤n-ˆ¤hsay-DYNM 1pl-DECL‘“What’s that?” we say.’ (B.Cv.84)192
The speaker, a teenaged girl from Barreira, uses the verb g’ç‚h- ‘be’ here instead of ni-, in joking
imitation of the Vaupés dialect.
192944As discussed in §6.2, the interrogative particle hˆ‚ (like Hup’s demonstratives)
occurs as a quasi-free particle when followed by the verbs nç- ‘say’ and nˆh- ‘be like’
whereas in all other contexts it is obligatorily inflected. Interrogative clauses formed
with hˆ) plus ‘say’ or ‘be like’ are irregular syntactically, as well as morphologically—the
clause is subject-final, as is typical of the polar interrogative subtype (see below), despite
the fact that this is a content question (examples 119-20). This non-canonical constituent
order is probably due to the fact that hˆ) is essentially inflected by the verb itself and is
therefore morphosyntactically bound to it; although certain bound morphemes can come
between hˆ) and the verb stem ‘say’ or ‘be like’, the subject of the clause cannot and is
therefore unable to precede the verb in the clause.

An additional minor subtype of interrogative clause that solicits a content
response involves the ‘Related Instance’ particle tá/ as its predicate (see §7.6):

"946Examples of predicate-focused polar questions are given in (123) (posed on the

Because predicate-focused polar interrogatives require a pronominal subject, the subject
referent can only be referred to by non-pronominal means externally to the interrogative

The interrogative discourse-marker =b’ay (see §17.4.1 above) is very common in

polite invitation (example 129).","[962, 963]"

‘what did you say?’ (hˆ‚ê-nˆ¤h-ˆ¤y Q-be.like-DYNM)The -V/ interrogative inflection that marks the clause-final verb stem in
constituent questions is an unstressed vowel-copying Boundary Suffix. It exists in a
mutually exclusive relationship with the other vowel-copying Boundary Suffixes on
clause-final verbs (Dynamic, Declarative, and Dependent marker suffixes; see Table
17.1), as well as with the Inchoative and most other Boundary Suffixes. The intonation
contour in constituent questions is consistently highest-pitched on the clause-initial
question word, and lowest on the clause-final verb. While a subject and, in a transitive
clause, a direct object (modified by the interrogative pronoun, see example 98 below)
may be present in the initial NP, other objects or oblique arguments usually occur outside
the main clause, as external topics following the verb (and usually uninflected).
Content interrogatives are illustrated in the following examples. Note that
emphatic questions often involve the Emphasis particle -pog, as in (99).","[955, 956]"

The clause-final particle ya (glossed TAG1) functions as an interactive tag. It has two
realizations: it occurs with interrogative clauses, where it appears with rising tone (ya‡),
and—more rarely—it appears on declarative clauses with high tone ((-V)yá), where it
attaches to predicates as an ‘internally complex’ Boundary Suffix with a copied vowel. It
is a stylistic device; in addition to being purely optional, it is subject to considerable844regional variation. Consultants say that speakers from the Japu/Vaupés area use it
more often than those on the Tiquié River.
In its more common interrogative function, ya‡ acts as an emphatic tag. It is
judged to be almost interchangeable with the interrogative emphasis particle ti‡
(§15.3.1.1), although it is considered somewhat more emphatic. Interrogative ya‡ is
especially common in rhetorical questions (asked not so much for information as for
rhetorical effect), but it is also used when asking an information question emphatically. It
follows a complete interrogative clause (whether a polar or a content question; see
§17.4), and often co-occurs with other clause-internal emphasis markers (e.g. =pog in
example 124). Examples of the interrogative use of ya‡ are provided in (123-27):

With predicate nominals, no clause-final Interrogative suffix -V/ occurs. The
clause begins with the question word, and ends with the noun being questioned; this may
be a demonstrative, a demonstrative NP, or a full lexical noun (examples 105-07). In the
Tat Deh dialect, the ‘intangible’ demonstrative yúp has a special interrogative variant
yúw, as example (105b) illustrates.(105) a)hˆê‚-n’ˆ‡hyúp ?",[958]
"605In the process, it retained a degree of independence from the verb, such that it still
occurs as a free form in the context of a pre-verbal object in a ditransitive clause. As
with bab’ in example (64) above, a clause may be formally ambiguous between the two
interpretations of /u)h, especially when Reciprocal/pluractional /u)h appears as a free
particle:(65)a)hˆ¤d/u‚Ùh[cug’Qtbé-éy]3plRECPleafshow-DYNM‘They show each other a leaf.’ (Or: ‘They are engaged in leaf-showing.’)
b)hˆ¤d=/u‚Ùhcug’Qtbé-éy3pl=os.siblingleafshow-DYNM‘Their brother shows (someone) a leaf.’ (EL)
Moreover, because the semantics of Reciprocal/pluractional /u)h is not exclusively
reciprocal, but can be generally interactional, the interpretation of the two clauses in (65)
may be pragmatically very similar.
But of the several words for ‘sibling’ in Hup, why was it ‘opposite-sex sibling’
that underwent this grammaticalization to a reciprocal, rather than báb’ ‘real or
classificatory sibling’, or some other sibling term? The definitive answer to this question
may never be known, but one possibility is the region-wide cultural importance of
opposite-sex siblings in marriage exchange. In the Vaupés region generally, the preferred
marriage pattern is sister exchange—ideally involving blood siblings, not simply
classificatory siblings—such that a brother-sister pair (of one clan/ family) is matched to
a brother-sister pair (of another clan/ family). This is a strong prerogative among many
of the region’s groups, and the close relationships that sometimes arise between blood
brothers and sisters are said to have the “purpose” of providing for their marriage (cf.","[621, 622]"

occur in the verb core when the vowel-copying Boundary Suffix -V/ is present, see §3.5.",[955]
"Q-NMZ2sgmake-FUT‘What are you going to make?’(OS/EL)
In the purpose question in (22b), the mere presence of stress on -teg is arguably enough
to give it a verbal identity; in addition, the semantics of purpose correspond to the
semantics of future.
Moreover, the two very similar questions in (22) could have equally similar
responses, since subjects are typically dropped in Hup when responding to questions.
Like the corresponding questions, responses like those in (25) are likely to be
pragmatically equivalent, and are formally differentiated only by stress.
(25)(a)hˆ‡/=teg
write=thing/shaft‘(It’s) a pencil.’
(b)hˆ/-tég
write-FUT‘(I’m) going to write.’
The semi-nominal identity of Future -teg / -te- in Hup may also explain its
ungrammaticality in negative clauses. Since Hup uses a different strategy for negating
nominal entities than for negating verbal clauses (see chapter 16), it is in fact predictable722that an intermediate form like teg would pattern irregularly in negated contexts. This
is supported by the fact that it is not only the verbal form of teg that is irregular when
negated, but the nominal form as well. On the one hand, a possessed nominalization with
=teg undergoes normal existential negation just like any other noun:(26)[[nˆ‡pQ‡m=teg]pãÙ]1sg.POSSsit=thingNEG:EX‘My seat (log for sitting) is not here/ does not exist.’ (EL)
(27)[[nˆ‡hç‚Ùp]pãÙ]1sg.POSSfishNEG:EX‘My fish is not here/ does not exist.’ (EL)
However, while most nouns can also appear with existential negation in predicate
nominal clauses with no overt copula, as in (28), nominal constructions with =teg are
ungrammatical when they appear with a nominative pronoun in the same type of
construction, as illustrated in (29); compare (29) to (26) above, where the only surface
difference is the form of the pronoun.","[738, 739]"
"720Once it had taken on future semantics, the verbal suffix -teg continued to
grammaticalize, producing the phonologically reduced variant -te-; with this step, the
‘purpose’ semantics was largely left behind, and -te- took on the primary function of a
future gram. Finally, in the Hup spoken today, all these manifestations of teg coexist: a
free lexeme ‘wood, stick’, a bound noun and nominalizer, and a pair of verbal suffixes
indicating purpose and future tense.
This historical scenario is supported by a number of ambiguous contexts
involving teg that currently exist in Hup, such as the purpose clauses given above (e.g.
example 20). Moreover, certain irregular occurrences of the form teg can be explained in
light of its history as a nominal form. Questions involving identity and purpose are one
such example of an irregular—and potentially ambiguous—use of teg. The question
“what kind of tree/thing is that?” is formally and pragmatically similar to the question
“what will you do with that/ what is that for?” in example (22) (stress denoted by
underlining):(22)(a)hˆ-n’ˆ‡htegyúp=b’ay?","[736, 737]"

Frustrative yQê‚h is common in exclamations of doubt (often phrased as
exclamatory/ rhetorical questions), in which it expresses uncertainty about the outcome of
the event in question—usually vis-à-vis the intentions or hopes of the speaker—as
opposed to the actual failure of the event or its goal (examples 45-49). Note that yQ‚êh canencliticize to interrogative pronominal forms such as hˆ‚có/ ‘where’ and hˆ‚n’ˆ‡h ‘what’752and can occur more than once in the clause (45, 47).","[768, 769]"
"950question to which one already knows the answer and is simply soliciting agreement or
confirmation, rather than more substantial information. Thus in Hup this type of
interrogative, which is the least formally marked subtype, also corresponds to the least
information-oriented interrogative—a cross-linguistically common pattern (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985: 180).195
Examples of this interrogative strategy are given in (138-40); in all cases, the
question is focused on the clause-initial constituent.

In this type of interrogative, it is common for the -V/ Interrogative suffix to occur
twice in the clause: both clause-finally on the verb, as expected, and also directly on the
fronted, queried nominal entity, giving it special interrogative focus. In this case, it
attaches to the final element of the queried noun phrase (as is consistent with nominal
morphological patterns generally), and receives stress—unlike the clause-final
occurrence of -V/ on the verb, which is unstressed. This focus function of -V/ is
illustrated in examples (141-44).","[966, 967]"
"10.2.1. ‘No reason’ adverbial hi‚
The adverbial expression hi‚ê ‘for no reason’, unlike most other adverbials in Hup, cannot
be broken down etymologically and has no other role in the grammar; it also never occurs
with the adverbial marker yˆ/. The adverbial form hi‚ê is exclusively clause-initial, and is
a morphosyntactically and phonologically free form, which may be followed by the verb,
subject, or other constituent of the clause. It indicates an action performed with no
specific reason, outcome, or related action in mind, as illustrated in the following
examples:(28)hiê‚/ãhpˆnˆN-yçhçy-yˆ/-té-hno.reason1sgtell.story-search-TEL-FUT-DECL‘I’m just going to tell the story as best I can (although I don’t really know it

For example, (31) was uttered by a teenage boy in answer to my question ‘why did you
quit school?’. Similarly, the speaker in (32) had been telling me how she had fallen out
with the people of another village, but would give no more details when I asked ‘why did
they scold/ yell at you?’.","[570, 571]"

The enclitic =b’ay, which appears with nominal arguments as a topic-switch
marker (§7.1.3) and with verbal predicates as an aspectual marker of a repeated action or
return to a state (§12.9.2), occurs frequently in interrogative clauses. It is always clause-942final, and it usually occurs on a noun, as in predicate nominal content interrogatives
(examples 108-9), and also in polar questions (see below). Its function in interrogatives,
where it attaches to a nominal constituent, appears to be linked to its function with
nominal constituents more generally; that is, it may focus attention on a selection among
a group of possible referents or options, especially in relatively emphatic contexts.

"6.2. Interrogative pronouns and question words
While they can functionally be considered as a single set, Hup question words formally
fall into two distinct sets. They are built on only two basic forms, /u‡y ‘who’, used
exclusively for animate (almost always human) referents, and the interrogative particle
hˆ‚. In form, morphological patterning, and semantics, /u‡y is essentially a personal
pronoun with properties closely resembling those of the other pronouns given in §6.1
above (i.e. primarily human reference, inflecting for case, possession, etc.).83 The
interrogative particle hˆ‚, on the other hand, patterns formally with the demonstratives
(§6.3 below), as is evident from Table 4.2 in §4.1.2, and from the tables in §6.3 below.
83The distinctive patterning of Hup interrogative pronouns (human referents vs. all other entities) conforms
to the special treatment of humans in Hup grammar; see §4.3.1.2, §4.4.1, and §5.4-5.",[382]

Where Inner Suffixes are present, most (such as Applicative -/u‚h- and
Distributive -pˆd- above) take the -V/ suffix, as would any verb stem. However, the
Future suffix pair -teg / -te- is exceptional: whereas clause-final verbs in declarative
clauses generally take the reduced form -te- followed directly by Declarative -h, only the
unreduced form -teg can appear in an interrogative clause, as illustrated in (101-4). It is
possible (although rare) for the Future suffix -tég to receive an additional -V/ suffix, but
the reduced counterpart -te-/ cannot occur (example 103). This is not true of
phonologically reduced suffixes generally, as illustrated by the reduced sequence -bˆ-/ of
Habitual bˆ¤g / -bˆ¤- in (104). Note that the Future suffix is irregular in other ways as well;
this may be due to its unusual historical origin (see §13.1).

of interjection or interactive tag, particularly for expressing a shade of doubt regarding an

"47Ethnohistorical accounts of the Tariana indicate that they arrived late to the region,
coming from the direction of the Rio Aiari to occupy lands already occupied by the
Wanano and Tukano, possibly around 600 years ago (Cabalzar and Ricardo 1998: 55,
Aikhenvald 2002: 24). Nimuendajú (1982) and others appeal to ethnohistorical accounts
to suggest that speakers of the Eastern Tukanoan languages entered the Vaupés region
from the west within the last 500-1000 years, while the Nadahup peoples (Maku) are the
autochthonous inhabitants of the region. However, this is still unclear and awaits future
research (cf. Aikhenvald 2002: 24), and it is worth noting that the origin myth of the
various Tukanoan peoples of the region involves their arrival in an anaconda-canoe from
the east, from Brazil, rather than the west (cf. Goldman 1963, S. Hugh-Jones 1979, etc.).
Reid (1979: 21) reports that the Hupd’´h say they came from the east, from the direction
of the Amazon River, on foot (whereas the Kakua say they came from the northeast, from
the Orinoco); in my own experience, contemporary Hup accounts of their origin closely
mirror those told by the Tukanoans.
Questions regarding the material culture and familiarity with agriculture of the
early Nadahup peoples are also not easily answered. However, their languages may offer
some intriguing clues to these issues, which are presented in the lexical comparison in
Appendix III.18 While these clues are of course provisional and somewhat speculative,
they suggest hypotheses that can perhaps be tested in the future through more in-depth
linguistic investigation, as well as through archaeological, ethnohistorical, and other

"15.3.4. Interactive Tag (-V)h´¤/
The Interactive Tag (-V)h´¤/ is used with statements to bid for attention and/or solicit a
response from listener. It may be related to the affirmative particle h´‡/ ‘yeah, OK’, used
for affirmative answers to questions or acquiescence to requests.
Interactive (-V)h´¤/ patterns in much the same way as do the other clause-final
discourse particles like Emphasis ya‡ and ti‡; it is an optional, stylistic device, its use is
subject to variation among individual speakers, and it is almost completely absent from
narrative—occurring only in quoted conversation or when a storyteller breaks out of the
narrative mode to make a meta-comment about the tale. Also like the other discourse
particles that are realized as ‘internally complex’ Boundary Suffixes (e.g. -(V)ti/ and
(-V)yá) in declarative clauses, it fills the required morphological slot (usually occupied by
Declarative -Vh) following clause-final declarative subjects, and requires an intervening
vowel-copy when attaching to verb stems.
Examples of the use of Interactive Tag (-V)h´¤/ are given in (133-36):847(133) tˆnˆ‡htˆ¤th´¤/, húp=d’´hb’ˆ¤yˆ/3sg.POSS string TAG2 Hup.person=PL onlynút ní-ih´¤/

Like several other clause-final discourse markers, (-V)h´¤/ frequently appears together

"Moreover, while Declarative -Vêh and the other vowel-copying suffixes in this set are640essentially semantically empty beyond their marking of clause type—Declarative -Vêh is
best understood as unmarked for aspect (or tense) altogether—Vêy makes a distinct
semantic contribution to the verb, relating to temporally on-going or ‘dynamic’ aspect.
Functionally, however, the factors governing speakers’ choices between aspect-neutral
Declarative -Vêh and the aspectually Dynamic -Vêy are complex, and are not fully
understood; these are touched on in the examples in this section, and discussed again in
more detail (with a focus on the Declarative marker) in §17.3.2.
Examples (1-3) below illustrate the prototypical use of Dynamic -Vêy to mark
events as current and on-going in the context of the moment of speech, and they also
outline some of the factors governing the choice of the Dynamic over the Declarative. As
example (1) illustrates, on-going events, marked with the Dynamic suffix, can be
contrasted with events that took place at some point in the past and are not currently ongoing, which are typically unspecified for aspect and marked with the Declarative suffix
-Vhê . Example (2a) is a typical yes-no question, in which the verb appears clausemedially in its Dynamic form (note that the Declarative is ungrammatical here both
because the verb is not clause-final and because the clause is interrogative); (2b) is the
expected response given that the event that is currently in progress. Finally, (3) illustrates
the co-occurrence of the Dynamic and Declarative markers within the same clause, where
-Vêh marks the end of the clause and Dynamic -Vêy marks the verb itself. This non-verbfinal clause structure is especially common in discourse relating to current, on-going641events, and allows the marking of both Dynamic aspect on the verb and Declarative
mode on the clause itself (see §17.3).

The dynamic or imperfective-like aspectual function of the -Vêy suffix is especially
apparent with predicate adjectives. As discussed in §3.1.3 and §10.1, adjectives pattern
much like verbs in their inflectional properties, although unlike verbs they do not require
a Boundary Suffix. When an adjective is inflected by the Dynamic suffix, the state or
characteristic it indicates is understood to have a dynamic quality, whereas the adjective
by itself (or when nominalized by the 3sg preform tˆh=, see §6.6) is more likely to
represent a permanent or inherent characteristic. This is consistent with Chung and
Timberlake’s observation (1985: 216) that a state may be conceived as dynamic and
expressed by means of progressive or other imperfective morphology when it is642“accidental, temporary, or subject to change”. The examples in (4-6) illustrate the
dynamic interpretation of adjectives marked by -Vêy. This is contrasted with their
uninflected forms; expressing the inherent softness of someone’s feet or the redness of a
flower with the Dynamic marker is judged extremely odd by consultants.","[656, 657, 658, 659]"
"965(191) núw-a‡nkˆt-kQ‡m!this-OBJchop-IMP2‘Cut this one!!’ (OS)
In a much less frequent use, the form kQ‡m appears without any preceding verb
stem, and behaves like a discourse particle or interjection (example 192). Consultants
say that this use is related to key-kQ‡m ‘look, pay attention!’; it may be an abbreviated
form of this common attention-getting expression that has developed a secondary use as a
discourse marker.

(T-PN.3)17.5.3. Responses to imperatives
Responses to commands are much like the responses to questions, discussed above in
§17.4.5. An acquiescent response is usually a simple h´‡/ ‘yes, all right’, as illustrated in
the text example in (193), and may also involve the repetition of the predicate (often in
future form). A negative response may likewise involve the repetition of the predicate, in
negated form.

(P.BWB.87)96618. Clause combining
Hup has a rich repertoire of strategies for combining clauses. Mechanisms
involve coordination, subordination, and cosubordination, including what may be best
characterized as clause-chaining. This chapter begins with a discussion of coordination
in Hup, then moves on to subordination and cosubordination, where at least one clause is
dependent on another. Hup has an especially wide selection of (co)subordination
strategies for indicating temporal overlap or succession of events.
As is consistent with Hup morphological patterns generally, most of the
morphological forms used to signal clause linkage are verbal suffixes or enclitics, and
these usually follow the second (or final) clause, occurring at the end of the sentence.
Only two are particles that come between the linked clauses, and both of these are
probably borrowings from Portuguese (likely via Tukano).
Many of the markers discussed in this section have already been encountered in
previous sections of this grammar. These have other uses that are distinct or only
marginally related to their clause-linking functions, and as such they may also occur on
independent clauses and even on clausal constituents. While doubt can rarely be
completely eliminated as to whether they are polysemous (either synchronically or
diachronically) or homonymous, polysemy often appears to be motivated semantically,
and is certainly in keeping with the high level of polysemy found among forms in Hup
generally. Where these forms are addressed in this chapter, their other uses are
mentioned, and cross-references are made to the appropriate sections in other chapters.","[981, 982, 983]"
"EPISTthat-DECLPOSS payment‘This must be to pay back for (my killing) your children!’ (P.BY.91)
The particle /u)êh is common in rhetorical questions and equivocal statements.
Examples (101-102) are additional cases of its use with predicate nominals, while in
(103-105) it associates with verbal predicates:
(101) /u‡y cáp/u‚êhwho INTS1 EPIST/a‡nhçÙ‚pk´k-w’ob-pQ¤-Q/1sg.OBJfishpull-put-go.upstream-INT PRX.CNTRpáh ?",[787]
"15.3.1.1. Interrogative emphasis ti‡
The particle ti‡ (glossed EMPH.INT) is a marker of interrogative emphasis, used in
emphatic questions and expressions of doubt (examples 97-98). It is generally
considered to be interchangeable with the functionally similar particle ya‡ (which also has
rising tone when used in interrogatives; see §15.3.3 below), although ti‡ may indicate a
slightly higher degree of doubt.",[854]
"Cesario=RESP-INT over.there.ITG grab-EMPH1-DIST-INT TAG1 over.there‘Cesario always gets (the money) there, doesn’t he, over there?’ (B.Cv.87)

steal-NEG 2sgPRX.CNTR‘Is it your own thing you’re selling me? You didn’t steal (it)?’ (OS)
It is also possible for the interrogative focus marker to occur on a vocative kin term or
personal name, used to reference the addressee to whom the question is directed:
(145) pãêç-ãê/,/u‡y=/u‚hníy húp /ˆd-k´¤d-´/,father’s.brother who=maybenúp hayám-át?",[968]

(referring to little ucuqui-seed flutes; once there was a Brazilian rivermerchant who bought them.)
Adjectives can take either the nominal or the verbal form of the Perfective, depending on
their identity as predicates or as nominal modifiers (see §17.2.3.2):
(88)a)tˆh=tQ‚êh [náw]-/e‡-h
3sg=songood-PERF-DECL‘His son used to be good.’
b)[tˆh=tQ‚êh náw]=/e/
3sg=songood=PERF‘(He) used to be his good son.’ (EL)
Perfective -/e/ also occurs with certain parts of speech that are not typical nouns
(although they may share certain features of nouns); these include the ‘what’ question
word, as in (89), and the nominal ‘Negative Existence’ form pãÙ (example 90):(89)hˆ‚-n’ˆ‡h-/e‡/yú ?","[683, 684]"
"(164) /QyQ¤t=yˆ/-áh/ˆnwQ¤d-Qyˆ¤k1pleat-EXCLtogether=TEL-FOC855‘It was together that we were all eating!’ (RU)
In examples such as (164), (165), and (161) above, -Vyˆk appears to function as much to
encode contrast as exclusivity. (165) was reportedly uttered at a drinking party, when
taunting a member of the host village who had thrown up from drinking too much beer;
her point was that the women of her own village (in contrast to those of the host village)
could hold their drink.(165) yúp=nih-áh

In Tat Deh, some speakers use the variant -VÙc (glossed EXCL2) in place of -Vyˆ¤k,
as illustrated in example (166). Despite its formal difference, consultants have no
difficulty identifying this as a functionally equivalent dialectal variant of Exclusive -Vyˆ¤k.

15.3.7. ‘Acting alone’ markers -ké/, -d’a‡h
The two clause-final forms -ké/ and -d’a‡h mark the speaker’s announcement of his/her
intention or desire to carry out a prospective activity, alone and under his/her own
motivation. In other words, they signal that the speaker is the unique agent, regardless of856what other participants might be otherwise involved. The use of these forms is highly
restricted. They necessarily involve a first person singular subject, but this (i.e. the
pronoun /ãêh) is obligatorily left unstated; it is understood from the use of the ‘Acting
alone’ marker. These forms also can only have future reference (but do not involve a
verbal future gram), and all the examples encountered so far involve the Perfective aspect
marker (which is typically used for future events of anticipated short duration). Unlike
the ‘Acting alone’ markers, Exclusive -Vyˆ¤k has none of these restrictions and is of much
more general use; these forms are contrasted in example (172) below.
These ‘Acting alone’ markers are relatively rare in discourse and are not yet well
understood. They appear to be essentially interchangeable and functionally the same,
although -d’a‡h may imply a more brief duration of the event. Examples of their use are
given in (167-69). Note that the analogous expression if the speaker wishes to solicit
company (rather than announcing that he/she will go alone) would involve the
Cooperative suffix -nˆ‡N (167b; see §14.5).(167) a)nˆ‡hç‚pcQ‡gkey-/ay-/e/-d’a‡h1sg.POSSfishnetsee-VENT-PERF-D’AH‘I’m off to check my fish net (alone).’ (B.Conv.1.3)

1sgstudy-PERF-KE/“I’m off to study (alone).’ (EL)15.3.8. Acquiescence particle bé
This particle, like the two described above, is poorly understood. It occurs quite
frequently in the expression h´‡/ bé ‘OK!’ where it marks acquiescence to an imperative
(while affirmative h´‡/ by itself can signal either acquiescence or an affirmative answer
to a question). This is illustrated by speaker B’s response to A’s imperative in example
(170):
(170) A: nˆN
2plpˆnˆN-d’´h-áy=mah,tˆ¤h-a‡n!tell.story-send-INCH.IMP=REP 3sg-OBJ‘You all tell a story for her quick, she says!’ (B.Cv.83)
B: h´‡/ bé
yes ACQ‘OK!’ (B.Cv.1.5)
The only other context in which the particle bé has been encountered is in cooccurrence with the ‘Acting alone’ marker ké/, as in (171). In this case, it may indicate
acquiescence in the sense that the speaker has made up his mind to do something after
some deliberation; however, this is as yet unclear. It is hoped that future investigation
will shed more light on the functions of this and the two equally mysterious ‘Acting
alone’ particles described above.
(171) yam-/e/-ke/bédance-PERF-KE/ ACQ‘OK, (I’m) off to dance.’ (EL)85815.4. Grammaticalized social connectedness
Quite a number of grammaticalized forms in Hup arguably have a primary—or at least a
very frequently exploited—function of indicating social relationships among participants.
This is loosely defined as ‘social connectedness’—the grammaticalized reference to
social characteristics or relationships between participants or referents in a speech event.
The idea of grammaticalized ‘social connectedness’ relates to short-term social
positioning emerging from the speech event. Where this relates to the expression of the
speaker’s own role in the social situation, this may be termed ‘social deixis’ (cf. Levinson
1983, Duranti 1997); in Hup, however, the ‘social connectedness’ grams encode not only
deixis, but also ways of talking referentially about other participants’ interactions.
Social deixis in language is often defined narrowly as involving “perduring social
relationships” that transcend the moment of interaction (cf. Manning 2001). Such deictic
forms include familiar and polite second-person pronouns and honorific terms of address,
which are both ways of indexing relatively enduring, pre-established social relationships.
Hup has two such honorific-like forms of address (also used for third-person reference):
=w´d ‘old/respected person’ and =wa ‘old/respected woman’ (see §7.4).
In addition to this, languages may grammaticalize situationally dependent social
connectedness or deixis, where the relationship is specific to the activity in question or is
created in the context of the speech event itself (second-person pronouns and honorifics
can have this ‘relatively creative’ function as well as their more common ‘presupposing’
one). In general, grammaticalized forms of specifically situationally dependent social
connectedness do not seem to be particularly common cross-linguistically, or are at least859not well described. Some examples do exist, however; for instance, the Arawak
language Tariana is reported to have ‘sociative’ serial verb constructions, in which the
second stem in the serial construction is the verb ‘be together’ (Aikhenvald 2002). Also,
in Tukang Besi (Indonesia), the ‘social activity prefix’ hopo- “implies that an action is
done for a social or ceremonial function, and not just for purely personal goals”
(Donahue 1999: 283), and Tarahumara (Mexico) is reported to have a co-ordinator which
is used “when harmony and/or good fellowship are implied between the conjuncts”
(Thord-Gray 1955: 516; J. Payne 1985b: 25).
Hup appears to have a relatively large repertoire of grammaticalized forms that
relate to such situationally dependent social connectedness. Those forms that appear to
have a primary function of indexing, creating, and referring to temporary relationships
between human participants are the Cooperative verbal suffix -nˆ‡N (joint performance of
an activity towards a common goal; §14.5), the ‘Acting alone’ markers -d’a‡h and -ké/
(speaker acts alone; §15.3.7), the inclusive first person plural future or hortative use of
Declarative -Vêh (§13.3), as well as the Associative Plural form -and’´h (a group of
people associated with a particular participant; §4.4.6), and (more marginally) the
‘Following’ marker hu)Ùy (one person physically follows another, usually in the joint
performance of an activity; §7.10). Other forms that typically encode social interactions
among human participants, but also have a more general function with non-human
referents, include the Contrastive n’u‡h (contrast between the referent and other entities;
§7.8), Exclusive -Vyˆ¤k, and even the Applicative suffix -/u‚h- (§11.3).","[871, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876]"
"(28)pátibˆ¤/-ˆ¤y=nih,/ó pedú bˆ¤/-ˆ¤y=nihPattie work-DYNM=EMPH.CO or Pedrowork-DYNM=EMPH.CO‘Pattie worked, and Pedro worked too.’ (EL)18.1.4. Adversative Conjunction ka‡h
Hup speakers use the adversative conjunction-like form ka‡h198 (‘but, though, on the other
hand’) to signal a semantic opposition to a previous clause or assertion in discourse, and
it can also occur in expressions of disjunction (usually in combination with the
disjunctive marker /ó; see §18.1.5 below). Use of Adversative ka‡h is limited to197Consultants who speak Portuguese identify this as a Portuguese borrowing.
A phonetically identical form kah appears in the verb compound kah-k´d-´y (kah + ‘pass’) ‘step over
(something)’ and in the locative postposition kaka‡h ‘between’, but there is no evidence that this
resemblance is anything other than homonymy.
198declarative clauses, while the Alternative Interrogative form =ha/ is used to indicate981disjunction in ‘either or’ questions (see §17.4.4).
Like most other formatives relating to clause linking in Hup, Adversative ka‡h is a
peripheral formative (a particle), which cannot occur in the verbal Inner Suffix position
(unlike many other peripheral formatives). It usually follows the last of two (or more)
coordinated predicates. Example (29) illustrates its use in coordinating two clauses
within the same sentence. In examples (30-31), it occurs on an independent clause that is
linked to the preceding discourse. The speaker in (31) had been talking about the
challenge of keeping one’s children fed.","[997, 998]"
"17.1. Boundary Suffixes and clause type
Morphologically, Hup clauses in general are loosely defined by the Boundary
Suffixes, as discussed in §3.4.1.2. While a heterogeneous group, the Boundary Suffixes
(particularly the set of ‘simple’ suffixes) generally share the function of indicating a
clause’s type. Accordingly, they distinguish dependent or co-subordinate clauses of
various kinds (adverbial, relative, complement, sequential, conditional, etc.) and main
clauses having a particular illocutionary force (e.g. negative, interrogative, optative,
imperative, etc.).
Of the Boundary Suffixes, a subset of forms—which share a vowel-copying
profile (plus an unmarked ‘zero’ form)—can be defined functionally as maximally
‘basic’ in that they mark several of the most distinctive clause types and are otherwise
largely semantically neutral (Table 17.1; see also §3.4.1.2). Although these morphemes
are heterogeneous in their patterning inside the clause (and may in some cases co-occur
within the clause), when they occur on a clause-final verbal predicate they are mutually903exclusive186 and correspond consistently to clause type. These are by far the most
frequently occurring Boundary Suffixes in Hup, although they are often supplanted by
various other Boundary Suffixes (e.g. the Verbal Negative -nˆ¤h (§16.1), the forceful
Imperative -kQ‡m (§17.5.2), etc.). Where they relate to declarative, interrogative, and
imperative clauses, the functions and patterning of the various Boundary Suffixes
(including these maximally ‘basic’ forms) will be discussed in this chapter. The clausemarking functions of other Boundary Suffixes are treated in chapter 18 and other sections
of this grammar.

The relative order of subject and verb plays an important role in defining
declarative, interrogative, and imperative clauses. In general, more than one ordering
option is available for a given clause type, but it is the interaction of syntax and clausefinal morphological marking that is crucial in distinguishing one from another.
The most basic morphosyntactic patterns that define the various types of main
clauses are listed below. Because the order of subject and object arguments in transitive

-Vêh; see §18.1.2 and below.

this schema. The patterns are indicated using the subset of Boundary Suffixes given in
Table 17.1 above, which are the most common markers of clause type, but it is important
to note that other Boundary Suffixes may appear in their place. For example, verb-final
declarative clauses may be marked with the Negative suffix -nˆh (or various other forms)
instead of the Declarative or Dynamic markers, and imperative clauses may take the
strong imperative suffix -kQ‡m instead of the -Ø form and high tone.

This section treats the declarative clause in Hup. Declarative clauses are defined both by
constituent order and morphological marking, and include both affirmative and negative
statements, as well as non-verbal clauses involving predicate nominals, adjectives, and
locatives.","[919, 920, 921]"

This combination is rare but occasionally occurs, as in example (58). Here, the
speaker is emphasizing the fact that the person in question has gone away from the
village, in the direction away from the river. The final stem ‘go’ is presumably more
resultative (i.e. he’s gone away), while the person’s direction is less time-stable or
important in the long run.","[530, 531]"

t ˆhpo/-d’´h-hi-yˆ¤/-ay-áh3sgopen-send-descend-TEL-INCH-DECLhe stripped it off.’ (KTW.106)Why do the productive compounds and the lexically specific compounds have
opposite stress patterns? The most plausible answer to this question is that when a
compound is perceived as part of a variable, paradigmatic set, the second or constant
component is in some sense perceived as given or backgrounded information, while the
first or variable component is relatively foregrounded. The stress pattern reflects the
speaker’s perception of this difference, in that he/she naturally pays more attention to the
variable component (this point is taken up again in §5.4.2).
It is important to note that, because the compound-initial and compound-final
stress patterns represent the two poles of a continuum between maximally lexically
specific and maximally productive compounds, compounds that fall in between may have
either of these patterns, or may take stress on both elements. In some cases, it may be
possible to motivate an in-between compound as transitional between the two types. For
example, kayak de‡h ‘tucupi, manicuera’ (the liquid left over from processing manioc, or
the boiled drink made from this liquid) takes stress on N2 (the pattern typical of lexically
specific compounds), despite its resemblance to the vegetable/fruit-drink paradigm in
(19) above. From a syntactic point of view, there is no reason why manioc liquid should
not be part of this paradigm and have N1 stress. However, that this particular compound
should be more lexicalized is no surprise considering its frequency—the preparation andconsumption of kayak de‡h is a daily focus of Hup life, whereas the other fruit drinks286are only available intermittently, on special occasions and when the fruits are in season;
thus its name is more lexicalized. Other compounds simply appear idiosyncratic; for
example, húp tok ‘caxiri (manioc beer)’, literally ‘person belly’ (example 22) and cç‚Ùh deh
‘rainy-season period’ (cç‚Ùh ‘island produced by high water’; de‡h ‘water, rain’) have
lexically specific meanings but receive N1 stress, like productive compounds.","[301, 302, 303]"

Instead, the only grammatical form of this expression requires a verbal stress pattern, in
combination with a constituent negator, as in example (30). A verbal clause has been
produced from a copula-less predicate nominal clause—but it is a peculiar verbal clause,157Note, however, that the Perfective aspect and other markers can also attach directly to the question word
‘what’, so this form with teg is not completely irregular vis-à-vis other verbal suffixes in Hup.",[739]
"42Interestingly, it was apparently his own grammatical mistakes in Tukano that were the
main subject of the teasing.
I had the opportunity to interact closely and over a long period of time with the
remaining Tukano speaker, who is the wife of one of my consultants. Her case is quite
interesting. Although she did spend many years with River Indians while a young girl
(from perhaps eight or ten years old until a teenager), living with a family to look after
their children, people all agreed that she was old enough when she left her village, and
spoke Hup fluently enough, that she could not possibly have forgotten it. However,
although today she lives in a Hup village and has a Hup family—all of whom speak
exclusively Hup in their interactions with her and other Hupd’´h—she will not speak a
word of Hup. Nevertheless, her level of understanding is clearly that of a native speaker,
and in fact her Tukano is not flawless, according to a local Tukano woman. All of her
conversations—with her Hup husband, children, parents, etc.—are carried out in two
languages; she speaks Tukano to them, and they speak Hup to her. No one seems to
think anything of this, since this sort of bilingual conversation is actually fairly normal in
the linguistic context of the Vaupés.
In me, however, she was faced for the first time with a person—particularly an
adult—who spoke Hup but understood virtually no Tukano. In spite of my inability to
understand, she never compromised herself by saying a single word to me in Hup, even
though I ate together with her family every morning, and often accompanied them to the
manioc fields or in other tasks. It was no different even when I was alone or nearly alone
with her and needed direction, such as when planting a manioc field, or was in danger of43getting hurt by something, such as when the canoe was moving into a tree branch while
I was not paying attention. She would always say something, but this was only in
Tukano, and I would always have to appeal to someone else to translate.
Other Hupd’´h had a variety of answers to my inquiries about the woman’s
refusal to speak Hup. Some seemed intrigued by my question, as if they had never really
thought about it before. Several responded by saying “she’s lying!” (i.e. about her
identity); one said ‘she’s ashamed’ (again about her Hup identity); and others did not
have an answer. Still others told me that the River Indians had given her ‘medicine’ to
magically make her switch languages.
Code switching into Tukano does occur in the speech of ordinary adult Hupd’´h,
but this is fairly constrained. While the Hupd’´h do not seem to be as anxious about
language mixing as the River Indians are reported to be, most do in general avoid
unrestrained borrowing and code switching, and sometimes respond negatively to others’
use of a Tukano word. In the context of narrative, on the other hand, spirits and animals
often speak in Tukano (cf. Aikhenvald 1996: 79, who notes that the Tarianas use Wanano
or Tukano in this context). People who are speaking about River Indians in a narrative
will occasionally mix in some Tukano words, especially when recounting a River
Indian’s part in a dialogue, and a few speakers will throw in bits of Tukano somewhat
more indiscriminately. Certain adults speak Tukano now and then to children with the
explicit intention of helping them learn the language, and once in a while young people
speak Tukano to me in order to tease me.","[58, 59, 60]"

Particles in Hup differ from clitics in that they are relatively loosely integrated with the
word core. By definition, they are grammatically associated with their host, but are
phonologically relatively free in that they receive independent stress. Almost all particles
in Hup follow their grammatical host, but there are a few examples of pre-verbal
particles; these are the Reciprocal/pluractional form /u)h and the Reflexive marker hup,
which can be separated from the verb stem (on which they usually appear as prefixes) by
an object nominal (see §3.4.1.1 above), and—more marginally—the ‘no reason’adverbial particle hi) (§10.2.1) and the bound demonstrative forms in association with189the verbs ‘say’ and ‘be like’ (§6.2).

Example (83) illustrates two Obliques in a single clause, one marking an instrumental
role, the other a locative role. Note that the case marker occurs on the final constituent of
the (N + Adj) NP and of the compound nominal, as is standard for all case markers in
Hup (see §4.3.1.3).

The Oblique’s locative function indicates that X is at the place of Y. In this semantic role
(but not in the comitative or instrumental), consultants usually judge Oblique -Vêt to be
grammatically interchangeable with the (object-like) Directional marker -an, and can
give no insights into any semantic difference between the two options (this is the case, for
example, in 84-88 below).63 Nevertheless, a comparison of how the two pattern naturally

N1 onlyAnother noteworthy feature of adjectives in NPs (which also helps to differentiate
them from most bound nouns) is their ability to occur in an explicitly nominalized form
in association with other nouns. This results in a noun phrase composed of [N tˆh=Adj].
Grammatically, this can be considered as two appositional NPs, since both elements can
take case and number marking separately; by contrast, in an NP formed from [N Adj]
without intervening tˆh=, inflection can only attach to the end of the NP. Examples of
appositional NPs involving nominalized adjectives are given in (131-32).

Where multiple adjectival modifiers occur in reference to a given entity, consultants
judge tˆh= to be obligatory on all of them:
(133) núp=tat tˆh=po‡g tˆh=pa‡y nçh-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤y
this=fruit 3sg=big3sg=badfall-TEL-DYNM‘This big ugly fruit fell.’ (EL)Adjectives taking tˆh= are clearly nominalizations. For example, a nominal416negator is required when tˆh= is present (example 134a-b), whereas a predicate adjective
(or a ‘bare’ adjective modifier within an NP, see above) takes a verbal negator (135).(134) a)cadaka‡/ tˆh=po‡g /a‡p

(135) /amˆ‡hpãêt w’´t-nˆ¤h2sg.POSS hairlong-NEG‘Your hair is not long’ (EL)
The [N tˆh=Adj] type of NP may optionally also pattern like a single NP
constituent, with inflectional marking occurring only once, at the end the unit, regardless
of the presence of tˆh=. Moreover, in many cases neither pause phenomena nor
consultants’ Portuguese translations of [N tˆh=Adj] constructions provide support for two
distinct NPs, and consultants often judge the variants ([N Adj] and [N tˆh=Adj]) to be
interchangeable.
Within NPs of the form [N tˆh=Adj], the main function of tˆh= appears to be one
of placing additional focus on the quality conveyed by the adjective. In particular, the [N
tˆh=Adj] construction always indicates a quality that is inherent or permanent, while an
adjective modifier without tˆh= may be either permanent or temporary. (Note that this
association of the more nominal form with a more time-stable attribute, and the more
verbal form with a more fleeting attribute, parallels the prototypical semantic distinction417between verbs and nouns across languages; it is also a characteristic of the bound
nominal construction, which typically signals a whole-part or inalienably possessed
relationship.) For example, a naturally dark-skinned hand is described as dapu‚êh (tˆh=)j’á
(hand [3sg=]black); but tˆh= is ungrammatical when referring to a soot-blackened hand,
which would be dapu‚êh j’á(-áy) (hand black[-DYNM]). Some adjectives, such as color
terms, almost always appear with tˆh=, and a few have even undergone phonological
reduction (consonant cluster simplification and vowel harmony), e.g. tuhúp ‘beautiful,
new’ and tˆdó [tˆRó] ‘red’ (Umari Norte dialect only). Examples of this type of adjectival
NP are given in (136-37).(136) j’ám

existed).’ (LG.O.33)
Where it occurs between noun and adjective in what appears to be a single NP
constituent, the marker tˆh= may be developing an identity as an attributive marker,
functioning to signal the connection between the nominal and the modifier in the NP.
While the above discussion has argued that the bound noun and the adjectival NP cannot
be considered the same construction synchronically, it is very likely that they are
historically and/or functionally related. Typological work has shown that there is crosslinguistic precedent for the grammaticalization of a possessive marker to an attributive
marker (e.g. in Oceanic languages, Ross 1998; Rießler 2004); in a number of cases, such418as in Ural-Altaic languages (cf. Rießler 2004), intermediate stages apparently include
a nominalizer, marker of definiteness, and marker of anaphoric-demonstrative focus. In
Hup, as this discussion has shown, one and the same marker tˆh= has the role of a marker
of inalienable possession (and individuation, related to definiteness) with nouns, and of
nominalization and—to some degree—focus and attribution with adjectives.","[431, 432, 433, 434, 435]"

that.ITG=AGAIN‘Who’s that?’ (B.Cv.90)
In addition to appearing with clause-final nouns in interrogatives, =b’ay can also attach
directly to some question words when these occur as independent utterances:

Although the normal function of =b’ay on verbal predicates is aspectual, it can
nevertheless serve its discourse-marking function when it occurs on an interrogative
verbal predicate. In this case, it always follows the interrogative inflection on the verb, as
in examples (111-13).
