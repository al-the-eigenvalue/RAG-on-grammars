"22.2Polar questions and alternative questionsPolar questions are questions that can be answered hunggan ‘yes’ or åhi’
‘no’. Alternative questions explicitly present two (or more) alternatives for
the answer. Like many other languages, Chamorro treats polar questions and
alternative questions alike. When these questions serve as main clauses, they
are either introduced by the complementizer kåo (glossed Q) or else distinguished from statements merely by question intonation. (Question intonation
is indicated by a sharp final rise; see Topping and Dungca 1973: 163-164.)
The options are illustrated for polar questions in (1).

"20.2Complementizers and conjunctionsChamorro has two complementizers and a larger number of subordinating
conjunctions. The complementizers are used to introduce finite embedded
clauses whether they serve as arguments or adjuncts. The subordinating
conjunctions, which have preposition-like meanings, are used only to form
adverbial clauses.
20.2.1 Complementizers
The Chamorro complementizers are listed in (2), along with approximate
English translations.2 Note that the complementizer na is omitted (not pronounced) in contexts to be discussed below. The unpronounced form is symbolized with a dash in (2) but not represented in the examples.

Pronounciation notes
The sound /h/ is often omitted in Chamorro, so the 1 sg. hu is typically
pronounced [u], and the 3 sg. realis ha is typically pronounced [ɑ]. The
orthographies represent the 1 excl. du./pl. as in and the 2 du./pl. as en, but
they have the same pronunciation (i.e. [In] in (35b)). The fact that these two
forms are pronounced the same has a result that language learners might
appreciate. A polar question whose subject is first person inclusive
dual/plural can be answered by simply repeating the words of the question
without changing the form of agreement (see (35a)). In spoken Chamorro,
the same holds true of certain polar questions whose subject is second
person dual/plural. As long as the predicate is a transitive verb, the question
can be answered without overtly “changing” the agreement, because the 1
excl. du./pl. in and the 2 du./pl. en are pronounced the same. See (35b).

Essentially the same patterns were documented earlier for displaced
interrogative phrases (in 22.3.2 and 22.3.3).
In terms of function, the focus construction provides one way—but not
the only way—of answering a constituent question formed by wh-movement. Consider the question in (15a), in which the subject is a displaced
interrogative word. This question can be answered with the ordinary
transitive clause in (15b) or with the focus construction in (15c). The difference is that (15b) allows for the possibility that there are others besides
Jose’s teacher who also know the answer, but (15c) does not.
(15) a.","[544, 545]"
"22.1OverviewChamorro has several strategies for forming questions. One strategy for
forming constituent questions involves the dependency known as wh-movement. When an interrogative word or phrase is displaced to the left edge of a
question by wh-movement, special types of agreement, called wh-agreement
and complementizer agreement, are used to register information about the
constituent that has been displaced.
This chapter is devoted to questions. 22.2 describes the formation of
polar questions and alternative questions. Then, 22.3 lays out the basics of
constituent questions, 22.4 describes the details of wh-agreement and complementizer agreement, and 22.5 discusses embedded questions and longdistance questions.",[512]

(44) a.",[255]
"15.4InterjectionsInterjections are word-sized or phrase-sized expressions used on their own to
make conversational moves. Like other languages, Chamorro has a large
number of interjections. This section surveys some of the most common
interjections used to affirm, deny, greet, bid farewell to, thank, and hesitate.
The affirmative interjections include the polite hunggan ‘yes’ and the
more informal affirmatives (h)å’a, (h)u’u, and u nai, all of which mean ‘yes,
yeah’.
There is one negative interjection, åhi’ ‘no’. Doubt, uncertainty, or indecision can be expressed with hekkua’ ‘I don’t know, dunno’. Hekkua’ can be
followed by an embedded question, as in (25).

"22.5Constituent questions in complex sentences22.5.1 Embedded questions
Like polar questions and alternative questions (see 22.2), constituent questions can be embedded in complex sentences, where they serve as arguments
of a higher predicate (see 20.3.1 and 20.4.1). Embedded constituent questions have the same form as constituent questions in simple sentences. The
interrogative word or phrase can occur as the (embedded) predicate, or it can
be displaced by wh-movement, accompanied by wh-agreement and complementizer agreement.
In embedded questions of the predicate, the interrogative word or phrase
occurs in situ (see 22.3.1), as illustrated in (37). These questions generally
are not introduced by an overt complementizer.

QBoth polar questions and alternative questions can occur as finite embedded clauses in complex sentences. Then they must be introduced by the

All the progressive predicates in (22-24) except for hassu ‘remember’

with the idea that they describe states rather than events (see 2.2.2.1 for the
details). Nonetheless, these predicates can appear in the progressive, although the neutral aspect is also possible. The nuances that determine which
aspect is chosen can be difficult to pin down. Compare (25a), in which the
adjective fresku ‘fresh’ appears in the progressive, and (25b), in which the

UNMNote finally that when the subject of the clause is a general indefinite, or
has a general indefinite as its determiner, it must be syntactically focused—
displaced to the left edge of the clause by wh-movement (see 23.3).
9.2.2 Meaning and use
General indefinites occur only in constituent questions, negative sentences,
the antecedent clause of conditionals, the standard of comparative sentences,
and free choice contexts. Each of these constructions makes its own contribution to the general indefinite’s meaning and dictates certain aspects of
its distribution. 9.2.2.1 describes the meaning and use of general indefinites
in constituent questions. 9.2.2.2 describes their patterning in negative sentences. 9.2.2.3 deals with general indefinites in conditionals and comparative
sentences, and 9.2.2.4, with free choice contexts. Finally, 9.2.2.5 briefly
describes concealed conditionals.
9.2.2.1
In questions
General indefinites serve as interrogative words in constituent questions. In
this use, they can be translated into English as follows: håyi ‘who?’, håfa
‘what?’, (a)månu ‘where?’, ngai’an ‘when?’, kuåntu ‘how much, how
many?’, and taimånu ‘how?’. Interrogative phrases in Chamorro are displaced to the left edge of the question by wh-movement (see 22.3). This is
why the general indefinite—that is, the interrogative word—appears at the194Indefinite pronouns
beginning of the constituent questions below. (The questions in (8b) and
(8d) occur in embedded clauses, which are enclosed in brackets.)

143)Note that Chamorro does not have infinitival questions—embedded
questions in which an infinitive clause is introduced by the interrogative
complementizer kåo or begins with a displaced interrogative word or phrase.
There are no exact Chamorro equivalents of English infinitival questions
like They wondered whether to leave early or It was unclear who to invite.
Embedded questions formed with taimanu ‘how?’ are sometimes translated
into English as infinitival questions, as in (40). But these Chamorro questions are finite embedded questions in which taimanu ‘how?’ serves as the
embedded predicate, and the apparent infinitive is a reduced clause that
serves as the embedded subject (see 21.6.4).

In a complex sentence, it is possible for an interrogative word or phrase from
an embedded clause—either a finite embedded clause or an infinitive
clause—to be displaced to the left edge of a higher clause. The result is a
long-distance dependency: the displaced constituent ends up one or more
clauses removed from the predicate it is associated with. Consider the longdistance questions in (41).

In embedded questions of arguments or adjuncts, the interrogative word
or phrase is displaced to the left edge of the embedded question (see 22.3.2
and 22.3.3), and information about the displaced constituent is registered by
wh-agreement and complementizer agreement (see 22.4). This means,
among other things, that complementizer agreement dictates the form of the
complementizer of the embedded question. Some examples of embedded
questions of arguments are cited in (38). (Note that in (38a) and (38e), the
entire complex sentence is a polar question introduced by the complementizer kåo. In (38d), the embedded questions are coordinated; the first is a
question of a direct object and the second, a question of an adjunct.)

from the other three. (Each row has a different combination of ‘yes’ and ‘no’
cells.) This finding argues against Topping and Dungca’s Chamorro-specific
system of parts of speech. In particular, it contradicts their claim that the
words in their Class II (i.e. B, C, and D words) form a single undifferentiated class. But it is compatible with the approach to parts of speech taken
in this book, according to which Chamorro content words are classified as
nouns, verbs, or adjectives and further cross-classified for transitivity. (18)
shows how this more traditional approach treats the four subclasses of words
investigated earlier in this section.

It is important that this approach to Chamorro parts of speech can
account for all the distributional evidence discussed so far, including Topping and Dungca’s properties (i-iii). The difficulty with their system of word
classification is not that it makes the wrong cut, but rather that it does not
draw enough distinctions. That is why it cannot handle the evidence presented in 27.3.1 and 27.3.2. The traditional system of parts of speech, which
is more articulated, does not have this issue.","[633, 634]"

Chamorro, almost all interrogative words are general indefinites (see 9.2.1).
Interrogative words can serve as predicates, arguments, or adjuncts. They
can also be part of phrases that serve as predicates, arguments, or adjuncts,
in which case the phrase is called an interrogative phrase. The syntactic
function of interrogative words and phrases affects the form of the question,
including whether wh-movement and the special types of agreement associated with it are involved. The details are described below.
22.3.1 Questions of the predicate
Interrogative words can serve as the predicate of a constituent question, as
can be seen from the following.
(5) a.",[514]
"9.2General indefinites9.2.1 Form
The general indefinites in Chamorro are indefinite forms that serve as interrogative words in questions and can be used to form negative indefinites in
negative sentences. They can also occur in the antecedent clause of conditionals and in the standard of comparative sentences. Finally, they can be
used as free-choice indefinites—indefinites that imply that it does not matter
at all which referents are chosen; any suitable referent will do.
The general indefinites are listed in (1), along with the restrictions on
their use. See 9.2.2 on their meanings in the different constructions in which
they occur.",[216]

displaced. This can be seen from the pairs of questions below. Consider first
the long-distance question in (43a) and the embedded long-distance question

‘Where do they want you to look for a new car?’In these questions, the interrogative word or phrase at the left edge of the

‘who?’ is the subject of the embedded adjective måolik ‘good’; in (41b),
håfa na disgråsia ‘what disaster?’ is the direct object of the embedded verb
cho’gui ‘make, do’; and in (41c), gi månu ‘where?’ is an adjunct of the embedded verb phrase. Long-distance questions in Chamorro must involve whmovement. Consequently, the interrogative word or phrase can be an argument or adjunct, but not a predicate, because predicates in Chamorro are not
displaced by wh-movement (see 22.3.1).
As expected, information about the displaced constituent in a longdistance question is registered by wh-agreement and complementizer agreement. Complementizer agreement registers information about the displaced
constituent on the complementizer of the question (see 22.4.2). This special
agreement is responsible for the fact that the interrogative word or phrase is
followed by the complementizer na in (41c), but by the null complementizer
in (41a-b). Wh-agreement registers the grammatical relation of the displaced
constituent on the predicate associated with it (see 22.4.1). This special508Questions
agreement is overtly realized on the embedded predicates in the long-distance questions in (42).

22.3.3 Questions of adjuncts
Interrogative words or phrases can serve as adjuncts to the predicate or to the
clause. Adjuncts are optional constituents that provide information about the
event or state’s location in time or space, duration, frequency, manner,
means, degree, cause, purpose, and so on (see 3.3). Adjuncts that are interrogative words or phrases are displaced to the left edge of the question by
wh-movement. Some examples are given below.",[519]

Finally, predicates that are prepositions evidently cannot occur in the full
range of constituent questions. In the questions below, the interrogative
phrase originates in a clause whose predicate is a preposition. The interrogative phrase can be the object of this preposition (as in (35a)) or the subject
of the clause (35b). But it cannot be an adjunct (35c).

INDEFINITE PRONOUNS
Chamorro has general indefinites—indefinite forms similar
to pronouns that serve as noun phrases or determiners, but
only in certain constructions. General indefinites serve as
interrogative words in constituent questions and as negative
indefinites in negative sentences. Noun phrase ellipsis and

‘Who does your father want to meet (lit. find each other) with?’Here the displaced constituents are oblique arguments of embedded intransitive verbs: håfa na sapåtus ‘which shoes?’ in (44a) is the oblique argument
of omlap ‘fit’, and håyi ‘who?’ in (44b) is the oblique argument of asudda’
‘meet (lit. find each other)’. Consequently, both omlap and asudda’ show
oblique wh-agreement. The higher verbs within these questions also show
wh-agreement. In (44a), hassu ‘think’ shows (the overt form of) object whagreement, because the embedded clause from which håfa na sapatus has
been displaced serves as its direct object. But in (44b), malagu’ ‘want’
shows oblique wh-agreement, because the embedded clause from which håyi
has been displaced serves as its oblique argument.
Higher predicates in a long-distance question generally show wh-agreement when the interrogative word or phrase is an argument or a ‘close’
adjunct—an instrument, manner phrase, or means phrase (see Chung 1994;
1998). In long-distance questions of other types of adjuncts, higher predicates might or might not show wh-agreement. Compare (45), in which the
higher predicate shows wh-agreement, with (41c), in which it does not.

(see 2.2.1.1.2). One such verb is the phonologically dependent verb malak
‘go to’. Malak can combine with a goal argument that is an interrogative
word, as in (7). When that happens, the two form a single phonological
word, although this is not reflected in the orthographies.5

‘Where did you (pl.) go when the war was beginning?’ (MM 109)These types of constituent questions are quite common. In all of them,
the interrogative word occurs ‘in place’ (in situ), meaning that its location is
determined by its function as the predicate, or by its syntactic category, not
by its status as an interrogative word. The interrogative words in (5) occur in
the same location as other predicates, at the beginning of the clause. The
interrogative words in (6) and (7) occur in positions normally occupied by
other noun phrases (see (6d) and (7)) or other determiners (6a-c). (The same

in situ distinguishes questions of the predicate from other types of constituent questions.
22.3.2 Questions of arguments
Interrogative words or phrases can serve as arguments, or parts of arguments, of the predicate. Specifically, they can serve as subjects, direct
objects, or obliques associated with a verb or adjective, or as subjects of a
predicate that is a noun or preposition. These interrogative words or phrases
differ from other arguments in that they do not follow the predicate, but
instead occur at the left edge of the question. Their location is determined by
their interrogative status, in other words. The discussion here assumes that
they are displaced to the left edge of the question by wh-movement.
When a noun phrase is displaced by wh-movement, it appears in the
unmarked case, even if it would have been in some other case if wh-movement had not occurred. Consider the questions in (8) below, which have an
interrogative word that is a noun phrase. In (8a-b), the interrogative word is
a subject; in (8c), a passive agent; and in (8d), an oblique argument that
specifies location. Even though passive agents are normally in the oblique
case (see 5.1.2.2) and noun phrases that specify location are normally in the
local case (see 5.1.2.3), all these interrogative words are in the unmarked
case.

UNM29.7More on glottal stopGlottal stop is one of several distinctive sounds in Chamorro with a limited
distribution within the word. This consonant apparently does not occur at the
beginning of words (but see below); when it occurs within a root, it must
follow a vowel or glide (see 29.3.1). And although glottal stop is pronounced
when it occurs right after a stressed vowel, elsewhere it is often assimilated
to an adjacent consonant or simply deleted (see 29.1.2).
This much is reasonably clear. However, glottal stops also occur in
spoken Chamorro in environments where they are not obviously distinctive
sounds. For instance, when speakers are asked to say a word beginning with
a vowel, such as åsu ‘smoke’, in isolation, they sometimes will pronounce
the word with no initial onset ([ɒsu]) or with initial breathy voice ([ɦɒsu]),
but other times will pronounce it with an initial glottal stop ([ʔɒsu]). The last
pronunciation raises a question: might the Chamorro words traditionally
described as beginning with a vowel actually begin with the phoneme glottal
stop? If such a reanalysis were adopted in its most general form, the lan-676Sounds and spelling
guage would have no vowel-initial words at all. Instead, all words formerly
thought to be vowel-initial (e.g. åsu) would begin with an initial consonant,
namely, the phoneme glottal stop (as in the hypothetical ’åsu).
A few descriptions of Chamorro phonology advocate this sort of reanalysis (see e.g. Topping and Dungca 1973: 170 and Klein 2005: 973). But
when a broader range of facts is considered, it becomes clear that there is
little positive evidence for taking word-initial glottal stop to be a distinctive
sound.
(i) In a study of the perception and production of glottal stop, Garellek
(2013) observes that “most languages tend to ‘insert’ glottal stops before
vowel-initial words...Glottal stops before word-initial vowels are often optional...No other phonological insertion rule seems to be as widespread as
glottal stop insertion across languages” (2013: 2). This crosslinguistic tendency could well lie behind the Chamorro pronunciation patterns described
just above. If so, the initial glottal stop sometimes heard in the pronunciation
of e.g. åsu would not be present in the underlying form of the word.
(ii) Glottal stops occur routinely in inflected words in Chamorro to separate two vowels that would otherwise be adjacent. Specifically:
When a prefix or proclitic that ends in a vowel is attached to a vowelinitial word, the two vowels are separated by a glottal stop. See the morpheme combinations and their pronunciations in (48). (Primary stress in
these examples is represented with ˈ. For simplicity, glottal stops that may
precede the inflected word when it is pronounced in isolation are ignored.)

‘sandy, full of sand’
‘help one another’
‘look at, watch (3 sg.

see 2.2.1.1.1) applies to a stressed syllable with no onset, the reduplicated
vowel is separated from the original vowel by a glottal stop.

further evidence that words like atan ‘look at’, unai ‘sand’, and so on begin
with the phoneme glottal stop. However, another explanation is available:
Chamorro is a language in which adjacent vowels are disallowed in indigenous words.13 This makes it just as likely that the glottal stops in (48) and
(49) are not present in the roots atan, unai, etc., but instead are inserted later,
to prevent an illegal sequence of adjacent vowels in the inflected word.
(iii) The key test for recognizing distinctive sound is the existence of
minimal pairs: pairs of unrelated words that differ in only one sound.
Minimal pairs establish that the contrasting sounds are distinctive—different
phonemes. Minimal pairs such as bula ‘much, many’ and bola ‘ball’ establish that /u/ and /o/ are different phonemes in Chamorro, despite the fact
that the difference between them is neutralized in many environments.
Similarly, the minimal pairs in (50), which differ only in the presence versus
absence of glottal stop, establish that glottal stop is a phoneme when it
occurs in the coda of a syllable.

has no minimal pairs that differ only in the presence or absence of glottal
stop in the onset of a syllable—and, more specifically, at the beginning of
the word. This lack of positive evidence suggests that word-initial glottal
stop is not a phoneme after all.
(iv) Finally, glottal stops sometimes occur in spoken Chamorro to separate vowel-initial words from prefixes or proclitics that end in sonorant13The ban on adjacent vowels holds for indigenous words but not for borrowed words, such as the Spanish loanwords /di.a/ ‘day’, /tsan.di.a/ ‘watermelon’, and so on. See 29.2 on the spelling of words containing sequences
of adjacent vowels.

consonants—specifically, /j/ or /n/.14 As with the pronunciation facts described at the beginning of this section, glottal stops in this environment are
highly variable across speakers and situations. Impressionistically, they are
found more often in slow speech than in fast speech, and more often when
the initial vowel is stressed than when it is unstressed. A few examples are
cited below.

[mɑ.ˈnap.plɑ.tsɑʔ] ~
‘dirty (realis pl.)’
[mɑn.ˈʔap.plɑ.tsɑʔ]As in (ii) above, the appearance of glottal stop in these environments
could be viewed as evidence that words like atan ‘look at’ begin with the
phoneme glottal stop. (If so, this glottal stop would have to delete optionally
after prefixes or proclitics ending in sonorant consonants and obligatorily
after prefixes or proclitics ending in obstruents.) The alternative is to say that
the patterns in (51) result from a failure of resyllabify. Generally, when a
consonant-final prefix or proclitic combines with a vowel-initial root, the
consonant and vowel are reconfigured as members of the same syllable (e.g.
chát-anti ‘bad spirit’ is resyllabified as /ˈtsa.tan.ti/). The forms in (51) suggest that this resyllabification does not have to occur when the prefix or
proclitic ends in a sonorant consonant (/j/ or /n/). When resyllabification
fails, glottal stop is inserted as a remedy, to turn the vowel-initial syllable
into a syllable with an onset.
Overall, the evidence just surveyed is either neutral between the two
hypotheses (see (i), (ii), and (iv) earlier in this section) or else tilts in favor
of the hypothesis that words like åsu do indeed begin with vowels.","[701, 702, 703, 704]"

single, one-time events that occurred or are occurring. The meaning of an
indefinite pronoun can also be conveyed by noun phrase ellipsis in
existential sentences, and by implicit arguments in other constructions. The

"49522.4Wh-agreement and complementizer agreementWhen an interrogative word or phrase is placed at the left edge of the
question by wh-movement, information about the displaced constituent is
registered elsewhere by two special types of agreement, which are called
wh-agreement and complementizer agreement (see Chung 1998 and the references cited there). Wh-agreement, which is described in 22.4.1, registers
the grammatical relation of the displaced constituent on the predicate.
Complementizer agreement, which is described in 22.4.2, registers other
information about the displaced constituent on the complementizer of the
question. Although the discussion here is limited to questions, these distinctive types of agreement are also found in the focus construction and in
relative clauses (see Chapters 23 and 24).
22.4.1 Wh-agreement
When an interrogative word or phrase is displaced by wh-movement, its
grammatical relation is registered on the predicate associated with it by whagreement. This special agreement indicates whether the displaced constituent is a subject, object, oblique argument, or adjunct. Like normal agreement with the subject, wh-agreement appears only on verbs or adjectives, is
sensitive to mood and transitivity, and has both overt (pronounced) and null
forms. The overt forms replace the normal forms of agreement with the
subject. Otherwise, if wh-agreement is not realized overtly, the predicate of
the question shows agreement with the subject as usual.
The overt forms of wh-agreement involve morphology that otherwise
appears on nonfinite predicates in Chamorro; namely, the infinitival agreement infix -um-, and a process of nominalization (abbreviated NMLZ in (16))
that causes the predicate to have the form of a noun (see 28.6). (These types
of morphology are descended historically from Proto-Austronesian voice
morphology; see Chen 2017.) Nominalized predicates show agreement as if
their subject were a possessor (see 7.1.1); their direct object, if any, appears
in the oblique case rather than the unmarked case. Some forms of whagreement combine nominalization with the infix -in-; others involve nominalization without -in-.
The forms of wh-agreement are listed below. Note that object whagreement and adjunct wh-agreement are realized optionally; that is, their
overt forms alternate with a null form that allows the predicate to show
normal agreement with the subject.","[520, 521]"

This book has taken a long time to complete. That it exists at all is due to the
generosity of many people.
First of all, I want to acknowledge and thank the speakers of Chamorro
who have generously shared their linguistic insights with me over the years.
Manuel F. Borja has been a consultant, collaborator, friend, and member of
the family, both in Saipan and in the U.S. mainland, for almost as long as I
have been studying the Chamorro language. Of the many others who have
been willing to share their judgments and linguistic intuitions with me, I
especially want to recognize Priscilla Anderson, Antonio M. Atalig, Felix P.
Babauta, Jose A. Bermudez, Jesus M. Cruz, Teresina Garrido, Ray Lujan,
Maria T. Quinata, and the late Agnes C. Tabor (in the continental U.S.); and
Dr. Elizabeth D. Rechebei, Francisco Tomokane, the late Anicia Q.
Tomokane, and the late Maria P. Mafnas (in Saipan).
Just as important have been the energy and achievements of the people
in the CNMI who have participated in the project to revise the ChamorroEnglish dictionary. Great thanks and appreciation to the members of the core
dictionary working groups, who include: Daisy A. Quitugua, Magdalena
S.N. Mesngon, and Aniceto H. Mundo (in Rota); Ester Basa, Angelina C.
Fitial, Bertha M. Pangelinan, Arsene M. Borja, Diana H. Borja, Florine M.
Hofschneider, and Leon Masga (in Tinian); as well as Viola S. De Leon
Guerrero, Jose D.L.G. Sanchez, Bernadita P. Sanchez, the late William I.
Macaranas, Frances M. Sablan, Carmen S. Taimanao, Rosalina M. Magofna,
Bernadita P. Sablan, Esther M. San Nicholas, Maggie C. Untalan, Vicente S.
Borja, Rita C. Guerrero, Glenn H. Manglona, Jose Ch. Camacho, Ana C.
Baer, and Elizabeth D.L.G. Concepcion (in Saipan). The editors—Dr.
Elizabeth D. Rechebei, Tita A. Hocog, Manuel F. Borja, and the late Dr.
Rita H. Inos—have been extraordinarily supportive. Liz, in particular, read
and commented on every draft chapter. Her high level of engagement with
this project has been wonderful. Cameron Fruit provided an electronic copy
of Nuebu Testamento at a key moment. Sen dångkulu na si Yu’us ma’åsi’
para hamyu todus.
Work on this grammar has been facilitated from the beginning by the
Chamorro-Carolinian Language Policy Commission of the CNMI and thexviiiNMI Council for the Humanities. I am especially grateful to the present and
past Executive Directors and staff of the CCLPC, especially Melvin O.
Faisao, Cindy P. Reyes, Bernadita P. Sablan, and the late David Omar. I also
want to acknowledge Scott Russell and Paz C. Younis, both formerly of the
Humanities Council, for their assistance. In 2019, I spent several days in
Guam as a consultant on Dr. Robert A. Underwood and Dr. David Ruskin’s
NSF project to document the CHamoru language. Thanks to the Kumision I
Fino’ CHamoru for an enlightening discussion, and especially to Robert and
David for their hospitality.
At UC Santa Cruz, Prof. Matt Wagers has been a great colleague, friend,
collaborator, and active user of the draft chapters of this manuscript. Our
joint research, which has taught me a lot, has been a real pleasure. I owe a
special debt to Scarlett Clothier-Goldschmidt, whose research showed me
how to do electronic corpus research on Chamorro, and to Boris Harizanov,
who designed the search engine and parser for the revised dictionary. Many
thanks to Prof. Jess Law, who generously talked me through my worries
about the meaning of mampus. Many thanks also to Richard Bibbs, Steven
R. Foley, Jed Pizarro-Guevara, Jake W. Vincent, and—much earlier—to
Jeanne D. Gibson, Catherine Crain, and Ann Cooreman for their interest in
Chamorro linguistics.

(from a tape-recorded narrative)Practically the only elements that ha’ cannot mark as focused are phonologically dependent elements that must lean to the right. These include
articles, case markers, most prepositions, tense-aspect-mood markers that are
not auxiliaries, complementizers, coordinating conjunctions, and many subordinating conjunctions.
As observed earlier, ha’ can co-occur with syntactic focus. Then it can
mark a range of words and phrases as focused, including the syntactically
focused constituent at the left edge of the sentence (see (3)), part of that
constituent (see (5c)), or some different constituent. In (7), the prepositional
phrase put ennåo na rason ‘for that reason’ is syntactically focused, but ha’
marks the verb atotga ‘dare’ as focused.

constituent appears at the left edge of the sentence, in the same position as
the displaced interrogative word or phrase in a constituent question. The
assumption here is that syntactically focused constituents, like interrogative
words or phrases, are displaced to the left edge of the sentence by whmovement (see 23.6).
Sentences with a syntactically focused constituent share many characteristics with constituent questions formed by wh-movement—so much so
that one might be tempted to treat constituent questions as a subtype of focus
construction. At the same time, the two constructions differ in certain
details.
A much wider range of noun phrases can be displaced by wh-movement
in the focus construction than in constituent questions (see 22.3.2 and
22.3.3). Syntactically focused noun phrases can be definite, indefinite, or
quantified, as illustrated below (with the focused noun phrase in boldface).

Wh-agreement
Wh-agreement offers support for the idea that certain causative clauses may
have two direct objects.
In Chamorro, when an argument of the verb is questioned, relativized,
or syntactically focused, the verb shows wh-agreement (see 22.4.1). This
special agreement, which replaces the normal agreement with the subject,
signals the grammatical relation of the constituent that has been questioned,
relativized, or focused—henceforth, the displaced constituent. For instance,
when the displaced constituent is the subject of a transitive verb in the realis
mood, the verb shows the subject form of wh-agreement, which is realized
as the infix -um-. When the displaced constituent is the direct object, the
verb optionally shows the object form of wh-agreement, which is realized as
the infix -in- plus nominalization of the verb.
Like other transitive verbs, causatives in the realis mood show the subject form of wh-agreement when the displaced constituent is their subject
(the causer).

embedded verb kumpli ‘accomplish’ in (43a) and the direct object of the
embedded verb cho’gui ‘do’ in (43b). Consequently, both of these verbs
show (the null form of) object wh-agreement. The higher verbs within these
long-distance questions also show wh-agreement. In (43a), the verb diseha
‘wish’ shows (the overt form of) object wh-agreement; this is because the509embedded clause para uma kumpli ‘they will accomplish’ serves as its direct
object. But in (43b), the verb malagu’ ‘want’ shows oblique wh-agreement,
because the embedded clause para un cho’gui ‘you will do’ serves as its
oblique argument.
The overall pattern is similar in the pair of questions in (44).

22.4.1.1
With a subject
Subject wh-agreement registers the grammatical relation of a displaced constituent that is a subject. This form of wh-agreement is sensitive to mood and
transitivity. It is realized as the infix -um- when the predicate is a transitive
verb in the realis mood. (Predicates that show an overt form of wh-agreement appear in boldface in the questions below.)
