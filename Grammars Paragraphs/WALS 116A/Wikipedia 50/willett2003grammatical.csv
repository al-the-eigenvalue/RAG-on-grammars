Yes/No questions in Nxa?amxcin are marked by sa?, which I represent

"In summary, ‘who/what’-type questions should not be possible if an incorporated noun is the question
target, while ‘which’ type questions should be possible.
The bound stem data indicates that neither of these are possible in
Nxa?amxcin.",[424]
"Viewpoint aspect, mood, temporal marking, negation, non-declarative operations—yes/no questions, imperative, prohibitive—and
nominalization are also discussed.
A description of the three different types of compounds found inNxa’amxcin—two involving free stems and the third (known as lexical
affixation) comprising a free stem and a bound stem—is provided along with the
corresponding word structure rules responsible for these compounds.",[3]

5.1Lexical Categories
In this section I briefly address the question of lexical categories inNxa?amxcin.",[94]
"Temporal markers indicating past and future were discussed insection 7.4 followed by negation in 7.5. Three operations subsumed under the
label non-declarative—interrogative (yes/no questions), imperative and
prohibitive—are the focus of section 7.6. Finally nominalization, previously
discussed as a derivational operation in chapter 6, is considered as an inflectional
operation in section 7.7.
The following chapter addresses compound formation in Nxa?amxcin, a
process that takes place before any derivational or inflectional operations are
realized.",[348]
"The glottal infix, used to mark inchoative aspect on strong roots, raises an
interesting question regarding the prosodic structure of roots.",[212]
"The vowel inventory is very basic with a high front vowel, a low central
vowel and a high back vowel, as shown in (2):

aCzaykowska-Higgins1993a:200Given the extensive range available between each of the three vowels in (2), it is
not surprising to find some variation among speakers. The high vowel /i/ is often
transcribed as [e], /u/ as [o], and /a/ as [ze]. The status of schwa is unclear and is
addressed in the following section.
4.2SchwaSchwa vowels appear regularly in Nxa?amxcin surface forms, which raises
the question of whether schwa should be considered part of the phonological
vowel inventory in (2). This question has surfaced for other Salishanists working
on languages throughout the Salish family.",[77]
"6.5Category-ChangingIn section 5.1, I briefly discussed an ongoing question in Salish linguistics
regarding lexical categories: Do Salish languages distinguish between the
categories noun and verb?",[246]
"90.253385
In examples (156) to (160), an [a] segment surfaces between the free stem and the
lexical suffix =spantk ‘year’. It is obligatory in these cases, unlike with the
=sqaxa? examples in (151) and (152).
The question that remains is what is the nature of this [a] segment?
were an epenthetic vowel, it would not have optional status in (152).","[397, 398]"
"With respectto =aya? ‘all over’, we have already seen the prefix ni?- ‘among a bunch of
things’ analyzed as a grammatical marker, and it would therefore not be a stretch
to consider =aya? ‘all over’ as a grammatical morpheme.
It is very difficult to prove the status of these bound stems as lexical or
grammatical, and I will leave this question open for future research.",[376]

"Recallthat one type of compounding in Nxa?amxcin involved the combination of two
stems with an intervening connector -a#-. The prevalence of [a] and [at] at the
left edge of the lexical suffixes in (161) suggests that these forms developed from
righthand stems in a#-compounds.17
The question to be addressed here is as follows:Are complex wordsinvolving lexical affixation formed by compounding, which I assume to be a
lexical process, or by some word formation process at the level of syntax?",[399]
"In chapterseven, I adopt a compound analysis of these lexical suffixes (referred to in this
work as bound stems) which, for my analysis of Nxa?amxcin word formation,
effectively reopens the question of which operations are relevant to the syntax
and which are not. As discussed in section 3.4.2, in this work I am including
operations that can alter the lexical representations of lexemes under the
derivational umbrella.",[158]

"Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade (1998:35) remark that “[o]ne ofthe important controversies in the study of Salish languages concerns the
question of whether or not these languages exhibit a distinction between the
categories ‘noun’ and ‘verb’ ”. This is an issue that has long been debated in
the field of Salish studies. Researchers such as Kuipers (1968), Hukari (1977),
Demers and Jelinek (1982, 1984), Kinkade (1983b), Jelinek (1993, 1995, 1998)

syntactic evidence in various Salish languages, that Salish does not distinguish

‘strawberries’ in (185) was coreferential with the compounded noun ‘berry’.
These results are clearly problematic and Czaykowska-Higgins, Willett and Bart
raised questions as to the grammatical accuracy of the judgements in (177) to
(182) in light of results like those in (183) to (185).
With bound stem constructions resembling compounding with respect to
word structure rules and the generic interpretation of nominals, I now present
additional support for a compound analysis of lexical affixation based on
syntactic properties.

English translation.",[239]
"Below I provide a description of each of the threetypes of compounding and provide word structure rules to account for the range
of combinations found in the available data.",[349]
In this case an open-ended view of the activity is presented with nospecific start or end-point.,[71]
"According to N. Mattina (p.263),there are four determiners, listed in (5):54Note that example (3) contains an adjective stem marked irrealis by the
prefix kat-. This suggests that adjectives pattern with nouns with respect to
irrealis marking. I do not, however, have enough adjective examples to confirm
this.
5It is very difficult to understand the underlying semantics of Nxa?amxcin
determiners by examining isolated texts. Both Matthewson (1998) and Kroeber
(1999) maintain that contrasts in Salish determiner systems are reflective of a
referential vs. non-referential contrast, as opposed to the definite vs. indefinitetype contrast found in languages like English. N. Mattina (2002) claims,
however, that the Nxa?amxcin determiner system is not reflective of this
referential/non-referential distinction, stating (p.283) that “[t]he marking of
definiteness and specificity is left to other interacting systems in the grammar”.",[96]
"This is also noted byAnderson (1992:82), who uses diminutive formation in Fula (Niger-Congo) andEnglish as a comparative example; the diminutive category is considered to be
inflectional in Fula, while in English diminutive forms are viewed as derivational.
Cases like this where one category can appear at different ends of a
spectrum depending on the language, involve more than just a distinction as to
where the operation actually takes place (i.e. the lexicon vs. syntax).",[66]
"Further investigation is required todetermine which future particles are restricted to which contexts.
7.5 Negation
Payne (1997:282) describes a negative clause as “one which asserts that
some event, situation, or state of affairs does not hold”. A pan-Salish analysis of
clausal negation has appeared in H. Davis 2001 where three major patterns of
negation are identified in the family. As H. Davis indicates, Nxa?amxcin
exemplifies two patterns.",[335]
"Bybeestates (1985:99) that “in cases where similar conceptual content is expressed in

"For example, in bothEnglish and Nxa?amxcin we can find forms where more than one morpheme is
linked to a single function. The plural form of child in English is one example.
Two separate processes take place when this form is marked plural. First, there is
a vowel change from [a1] to [1]; second, there is the addition of the suffix -ren,
resulting in [Ciljron]. The following Nxa?amxcin example also illustrates this
kind of morphological asymmetry:
(10)tex*mintn
tox-min-tn
sew-INS-INS
threadKinkadeBoth -min and -tn are glossed as instrumental suffixes.1981a:20In (10) we have onefunction, instrumental, linked with two forms, -min and -tn.
Conversely, it is possible for one morpheme to be linked to a number of
different functions.",[34]
"Baker’s (1996) work within a Principles and Parameters(Minimalist) framework (Chomsky 1993) advances his 1988 views to include a
syntactic explanation for why languages like Mohawk have syntactic NI, while
languages like English do not.
To best illustrate the varied use of the term noun incorporation, I provide abrief overview below of Mithun 1984 and Baker 1996.
8.4.4.1.1 Mithun’s Analysis of Noun Incorporation
The broad use of the term noun incorporation is best illustrated in Mithun
1984, who writes that “NI apparently arises as part of a general tendency in
language for V’s to coalesce with their non-referential objects” (p.891).",[411]
"The habitual forms in (313) to (316) clearly have a predicative function.
Many habitual forms, however, have a nominal interpretation as evidenced from
the translations provided by the speakers.",[217]

Further investigation is required to determine exactly what aspectual interactions
are involved with Nxa?axmcin limited control forms.","[245, 246]"
"No attention is paid to the beginning or end of this
event, only the period between start and finish. Example (58) indicates that theimperfective viewpoint can also be applied to nouns with a predicative function,
e.g. yalmix”m ‘chief’. And finally, example (59) indicates that imperfective
viewpoint is not restricted to present time.",[316]
"Whiletranslations for the Nxa?amxcin data involving both the limited control and outof-control operations are not as revealing as those provided by Carlson, I expect
further inquiry would reveal that the facts are parallel with those for Spokane,
given the range of similarities described earlier.
Kinkade (1982c:54) mentions an intransitive limited control suffix, -nwatn
which he notes does not appear very frequently in the data.",[244]
"Again, the grammatical features are present but there is no phonologypresent to indicate third person transitive object.
Conversely, it is possible for a form to be present without any associated
meaning.",[35]
"Scalise (1988:563) claims that derivational rules “change theconceptual meaning of their base”, while inflectional rules “change the
grammatical meaning of their base”. This is addressed in detail in Bybee 1985,
who states (p.99) that:
[...] inflectional meaning is always very general, indeed, often so general as
to be redundant in context, and it is always transparent in the sense that its
combination with a stem always produces a predictable meaning.
Derivational meaning, on the other hand, has more semantic content and
often produces idiosyncratic meanings in combination with different
lexical stems.
According to Bybee, the greater the semantic relevance to the root, the closer the
morpheme will appear to the root.
The locative, relational, and limited control categories all provide the root
with some form of semantic extension, as illustrated in (51) to (53):
