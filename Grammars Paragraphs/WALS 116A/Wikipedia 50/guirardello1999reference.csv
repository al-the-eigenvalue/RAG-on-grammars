"2306.2. Interrogative clausesThis section will be dedicated to the study of interrogative clauses in Trumai and
how they are organized. The interrogative clauses can be divided into two major types: (1)
polar questions, which request a yes-no answer, and (ii) information questions, which can
request information about a participant in an event (who; what), about a location (where),
a specific time (when), a reason (why), and so on.","[257, 258]"

"‘T am married.’
(lit: I have a woman)What about when the clause is a negative answer? Again, clauses with verbs show
the syntax of nominal predicates, but the Negation particle used is the one that typically
modifies verbs, tak. '9 For instance:
Negative answer to question - first person:V Neg
(70)SCopa.di takka_inha_chi.",[224]
"Cop-3AbsThen a question arises: can the order between ke and tak be reversed, in order to
negate not only the verb, but the whole predicate? The answer is no. The negator tak is
used if we negate the verb itself, that is, if we want to negate the nucleus of the predicate.
If we want to negate the predicate as a whole, then the Negation particle used is anuk,
which typically negates nominal predicates, as illustrated above:(75)Vv

‘I do not kill jaguars (habitually).’200In all of the examples given above, the clauses have the structure of a cleft
construction: the verb is isolated in first position in order to be highlighted, it undergoes
relativization, and the Copula is present.”! So, example (68a), which is an answer to the
question ‘Do you work?’, could be interpreted as: ‘Yes, I am one who works’. The use of
the negator anuk in example (75) suggests that the verb is relativized. Therefore, one
possible analysis would be to say that all the examples above are instances of cleft
constructions with focus on the verb/predicate.
However, this analysis cannot explain one syntactic property of these
constructions: when the negator tak directly modifies the verb (example (74)), kebecomes optional. It would be strange for a cleft construction to optionally relativize the
verb. Another problem with analyzing all of (68-69b), (74), and (75) as instances of cleftsis that this construction occurs more frequently than we would expect for a cleft.
Basically, these clauses are the usual way of answering a yes/no question about a habitual
event.
There is one more problematic point in saying that these examples are instances of
cleft: how can we account for a clause with a Transitive verb - such as the example below
- where the “subject” of the “nominal predicate” (i.e. the relativized verb) is marked as
Ergative?

"2336.3.1. Negation in verbal predicates6.3.1.1. Negating the verbAs already mentioned in chapters 3 and 5, to negate verbal predicates, the
Negation particle tak follows the verb, or the verb plus other elements, such as
auxiliaries. Negative clauses can present different word orders, depending on whether the
clause is a simple statement or an answer to a question. When it is the second case (i.e.
answer), the clause has a nominal-predicate configuration (cf. chapter 5, section 5.2.3 on
this issue). For instance:A

20 In affirmative answers, the order [V ke ka_in S Cop (DAT)] or [V ke ka_in A O Cop (DAT)] is used
when the verb refers to an habitual event (e.g. I work). In negative answers, this order occurs for nonhabitual events (e.g. I am not working, I did not work). When the negative answer refers to a habitual event
(e.g. I do not work), the morpheme t(a)ke ‘Privative’ is used (cf. chapter 4, section 4.3).",[224]
"A problem regarding the pronominal set in Trumai involves two forms observed
in the corpus that seem to be also pronominal: in and ni. These two forms can be found
behaving as pronouns, that is, acting as the head of an NP and receiving nominal
morphology:
(44)in yi-ki
it(45)‘at it (it = the event of a woman going to work)’yYI-Datin-is‘at it (it = the event of a friend making a question)’it-Dat
(46)(47)in lots’

lots’
this Allat‘from this.one (one=place, the village), from here’However, there are no examples of in referring to a physical object rather than to
an event. Perhaps this is just a matter of a gap in the corpus. More complicated is the case
of ni, which sometimes behaves as an adverb:
(49)ni-ahi chi?here-Quest 2 Cop
“Are you here?”®
8 Observe that the adverbs nina ‘here’ and ina ‘there’ do not receive case marking:32(50)ni!
here
‘Here!’ (answer to the question: Where is the coffee?)Could we say that ni is a pronoun that sometimes can behave as an adverb? Or is
the adverbial occurrence of ni actually a reduction of the adverb nina ‘here’? At the
moment, there are no definitive answers for these questions. The only thing we could say
is that it would be possible to align in and ni with the attested Trumai pronouns:
Masc_
ineFem
inatlNeuter
in‘he - she -it’ni'de_ni’datlni‘this.one (M) - this.one (F) - this.one (N)’However, there are further questions: (1) it is necessary to check if both in and nican be pluralized. This capacity would make more clear their pronominal status; (2) there
is no neutral form for ‘that one’. In one text, the form inde was found, but it seems to be
an adverb rather than a demonstrative pronoun (i.e. ‘there (not so far from speaker or
listener)’ rather than ‘that one’). This third form needs to be investigated further, and theother ones - in and ni - need extra checking, with special attention to the interplay
between ni and nina.
As a final remark, we observe that the set of adverbs for place have anintermediate stage between proximal and distal: ina ‘more or less close’. The whole set is(i)wana aha’tsi ninaImp
sit

demonstratives, that is, there is a gap in set:

"There is one extra problem that needs to be discussed: the behavior of ke in
negative answers with a verb in first position (such as in example 74) is not exactly the
same as the ke that occurs when the Absolutive NP is non-adjacent to verb, because the202latter is obligatory. Thus, we would have to say that we have a fourth kind of ke in
negative answers, and that this ke is perhaps another derivation from the Relativizer ke.
It is not clear if this analysis is desirable; that is, if it is really necessary to
distinguish every single instance of ke as being a different case, or if it would not be
better to unify them. It is hard to make a decision. An additional fact that deserves
attention is that a verb negated by tak patterns together with nominal elements in other
contexts, for example, in imperative constructions (cf. chapter 3, section 3.3.4, and
chapter 6, section 6.4). Thus, perhaps the presence of morpheme ke in negative answers
has to do with the negative modality itself rather than to the “answering question”
construction. In the moment, what it is visible is that ke here interacts with both focus and
negation.","[227, 228]"
"231This is the case for questions used when the speaker wants confirmation about something
(the declarative clause has a descending contour at its end, while the question has an
ascending contour):_>,.ho’kela. hi ma.","[258, 259]"
"‘She is a woman.’‘He is married’
(lit: He has a woman).’5.2.3. Verbal predicate becomes similar to nominal predicateSometimes both nominal and verbal predicates can become very similar in form,and that represents a problem of analysis. Basically, when the clause is an answer to a
specific question, and the verb codifies the new information or the information that needs
to be confirmed, the clause has the structure of a cleft construction with the verb in focus.",[222]
"XXii
Historical studies, such as those made by Heine and Reh (1984) and Heine (1993,1997) have also been very insightful for me, giving me an idea of how historical
developments can give rise to some patterns observed in a language. Some of Heine’s
ideas were the basis for my analysis of the Trumai auxiliaries (chapter 4) and for the
internal reconstruction that I propose in chapter 5. As J mention in the latter chapter, the
internal reconstruction presented there does not have the purpose of describing the
synchronic data; it is merely a way of bringing new light on the facts observed in the data,
seeing them from a different perspective. Of course, when we talk about historical
changes and the rise of new patterns, several questions have to be addressed, such as:
(i) how can we avoid the danger of transferring diachronic analyses to the synchronic
grammar?
(ii) how can we recognize that a morpheme or a construction is still the same or is already
a “new” one? Which or how many criteria are necessary to qualify a morpheme/
construction as reanalyzed? Are semantic and pragmatic differences enough, or do we
need also syntactic, morphological and phonological differences?
(iii) how can we avoid performing the analysis of linguistic data only on the basis of
syntax? That is, how can we use the evidence from syntax without being completely
driven by it, to the point of ignoring other levels, such as semantics and pragmatics?
These questions are not easy to answer. A linguist may address them in different
ways, depending on his/her theoretical perspective, and different answers have different
consequences. Depending on how the second question is answered, the analysis of a
morpheme/construction can change a lot.","[24, 25]"
"197As already mentioned, in Trumai new or important information, or informationthat needs confirmation, comes at the beginning of the clause. If somebody asks a
question such as: ‘Do you work (habitually)?’, or “Are you married (i.e., Do you have a
woman)?’, or even ‘Are you a woman/What are you?’, the answer will have the requested
information in first position:
Work
Have.woman
WomanI.
I.
lam.","[222, 223]"
"As we can see, the facts observed in the Trumai data exactly181match the scenario described by Heine and Reh. For this reason, from now on we will
make distinction between contrastive focus - observed in examples (46-49) - and
completive focus, observed in examples (50-55) above. Although similar, these two
kinds of clauses are not the same, because their function is different (completive focusfills a gap in the knowledge of the addressee; contrastive focus does not fill a gap, it just
makes the knowledge of the addressee more accurate by correcting wrong information).
With regard to examples (53-55), they are also different from the clefts presented
above, because in these examples what separates S/O from the verb is an adverb, not the
Focus/Tense particles. Therefore, they do represent a different kind of environment forthe occurrence of ke.
A question is then raised: is the ke observed in clauses where the Absolutive NP is
far from the verb the same ke as found in nominalizations? Is it the same ke as found in
cleft clauses? We would like to say yes to this question, in order to have a unified account
for all these three cases, since in all of them the form in question is the same, ke.
However, a unified account is not possible, given the differences among the cases: the ke
nominalizer is phonologically different from the others, because it is bound: -ke. The
difference is more transparent when -ke modifies a root ending in vowel, because in this
case the allomorph used (-k) shows that the nominalizer is bound. The other two kemorphemes are insensitive to the last sound of the word they modify, as pointed outbefore.’ Also, ke relativizer shows some flexibilities that would not be expected with a7 Actually, the case of nominalizations involving verbal roots ending in consonant is a little more
complicated, because the allomorph used is ke, which then generates ambiguity between the nominalizer
and the relativizer. That’s why sometimes it is hard to say if what we have is one ke or the other. In order to
distinguish them, we take in account the context of occurrences (root + ke inside an NP or verb in a clause).","[206, 207]"

ModalityIn this chapter, issues related to modality will be presented. Some of the issues
treated here were already mentioned in previous chapters; for this reason, some points
will be treated briefly in this chapter, leaving more room for the issues that are new, such
as the alternative ways for expressing the negative modality in verbal and non-verbal
predicates.
First, there is a short section on declarative clauses; a general view of this kind ofclauses will allow us to see better the differences between them and the clauses in other
modalities. Next, we have sections on interrogative clauses (with polar and non-polar
questions), followed by a section on negative clauses, exploring negation in verbal and
non-verbal predicates. The negation of single elements, and negative words such as
‘nobody’ or ‘nothing’, will also be addressed. Finally, we have a section on imperative
constructions in the affirmative and negative modalities.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256]"

Examples (50-55) seem to be what Heine and Reh (1984) call completive focus:“This type of pragmatic function does not involve contrast, the focus information is
meant rather to fill a gap in the pragmatic knowledge of the addressee. Most clearly,
completive focus manifests itself in answers to WH-questions. It may refer to either
arguments (term focus), or predicates (predicate focus), possibly also entire clauses.”

the person who asks the question. The term ‘focus’ is used in the linguistic literature to
refer to new information.
As showed in chapter 2 (section 2.2.3), not all WH-questions have the morpheme
in, because the use of the WH-word itself is enough to indicate that information is being
requested. The use of in just makes more explicit which piece of information is missing
in the knowledge of the person who makes the question.
The morpheme in sometimes can be found in affirmative clauses, such as in
examples (14-16) below. However, the occurrence of in in non-interrogative clauses is
rare. We hardly find examples like the ones above, while the number of affirmative

which is new to the speaker, not yet integrated into his overall picture of the world”). The

such as the following one:

"Cop‘I am not curved (I have never been curved).’6.3.5. Negation of single elements/specific pieces of informationSuppose that a person learns about a piece of information that s/he thinks is not
correct according to her/his knowledge. The person probably will try to negate this
specific piece of information, in order to present the correct one. For instance, somebody
is told: ‘I heard that your mother got seriously sick’, but the speaker is wrong about who
got sick.The interlocutor then may reply: ‘No, not my mother. It was my sister who got
sick.’ In the reply, a specific piece of information is being negated. How is this kind of
negation made in Trumai?
When the piece of information being negated involves a pronoun, numeral,
adjective, or quantifier, the negator used is anuk, which - as we have seen before - is the
Negation particle for nominal constituents. Looking at examples (66-70), we may think
that anuk is directly modifying the pronoun/numeral/adjective/quantifier. However, when
we look at example (65), we can see that what anuk is modifying is not really a noun, but
rather a NP, which is probably the non-verbal predicate of a subject that is assumed by
the context, but not formally present (i.e. (Who is coming) is not Kumaru ; cf. English
pleonastic ‘it’: It is not Kumaru). We believe that the same is happening in the other
examples, that is, what anuk is negating is the non-verbal predicates of the implicit245subject: (Who went to Pavuru) was not us; (The hammocks that I bought) were not two;
(The coffee that I made) is not much; (My sister) is not tall.e(65)Noun[Kumaru yi] anuk.

expect the occurrence of [a’di tak] ‘a few (lit: not many)’ or [pix tak] ‘a little (lit: not
much)’, instead of Quantifier + anuk. A possible account for these examples would be to
say that [pix tak] and [a’di tak] are lexicalized as ‘a few’ and ‘a little’, respectively (a246point already mentioned in chapter 3, section 3.3.2). In this case, a separate negation
construction would be necessary for contrastive negation. If this hypothesis is accurate,
we would expect the combinations [a’di tak] anuk ‘it is nota few’ and [pix tak] anuk ‘itis not a little’ to be possible. If they are, then we indeed have a case of lexicalization.
This is a point to be checked in future field work.
Back to the negation of pieces of information, what about when the piece being
negated involves an adverb or a verb? In the case of an adverb, the negative word used ishahak, which means ‘no’ and which can be the answer to a yes/no question (example 71).
Hahak does not modify the adverb directly; the adverb is presented, followed by a pause,
and then hahak comes, negating apparently a presupposed question that includes the
adverb: [ (Am I going to sleep) here? No.]. In the case of a verb, we have the Negationparticle tak, modifying the verb (example 72). It is also possible to have the whole clause
repeated, but now in the negative modality (73).

the speaker to convey new information about the verb or its arguments, but rather to deny
information that the speaker thinks the listener has in mind. Any negative act has a
presupposed (or backgrounded) portion and an asserted (or foregrounded) portion. The
background portion means that there is some shared knowledge between speaker and
listener, who have a kind of communication contract. The negation denies the asserted
portion of the corresponding affirmative sentence, but the presupposed portion is not
denied. So, when a speaker negates an event involving an entity, he may deny that the
event happened, or that the entity was involved in the event, but he does not deny the
existence of the entity, which is assumed by the speaker. As Givén says, the negation of
the referentiality of the entity is coded by other forms, such as the negative words nobody
and nothing.
In Trumai, there are no special words like English ‘nobody’ or ‘nothing’, but there
are ways of expressing the same idea. Let’s see how the negation of referentiality is
expressed in Trumai.enobody
The idea of ‘nobody’ is expressed through the negation of the verb plus the use ofthe noun yaw, which literally means ‘people’, but when in a negative clause, has the
opposite meaning: ‘no people’. For example:

Hum.PlAnim.Pl
Inan.PlIndividuation is a strong conditioning factor in the choice of the Dative marker.
Note in the chart above that no dual is ever higher than a singular, and no plural is ever
higher than a dual.
Identifiability is also an important conditioning factor. For the NPs that have two
options for Dative markers, the choice of one marker or the other depends on the
identifiability of the entity being referred to. When the entity is less identifiable, the
second option of each pair is used (cf. examples (54) and (58)). Observe that the question
of identifiability is not a matter of polar choice (i.e. definite/identifiable [+],
indefinite/non-identifiable [-] ), but rather it is a matter of degree (i.e. very identifiable,less identifiable, even less identifiable, non identifiable). It is possible to see this in
example (52), where the NP [paye yi] is marked by -ki, and the consultant translates the279NP as ‘a shaman’ or ‘the shaman’; although the entity being referred to can somehow be
identified (the shaman), the identification is not so complete because the speaker does notknow the shaman well (then, the translation ‘a shaman’ can also be possible).
Therefore, individuation and identifiability are important key factors in the
selection of the Dative marks. When an entity is very individuated, it has more chance of
being identified; this does not mean that the entity necessarily will be so, but it has more
chance, since it is the only goal of the listener’s attention. On the other hand, when the
entity is not individuated, the chances of being identified decrease a little, given that there
are more elements now to be observed by the listener.
The question of identifiability raises the issues of topicality and discursive
importance. The identification of an entity (or group of entities) may depend on how
relevant the entity is for the event that is being described. If the entity is not one of the
central participants of the event, the speaker probably will not offer much information
about it, and therefore, the listener will be less able to identify it. Conversely, if the entityis not so identifiable, it almost certainly is not so relevant or has no great importance in
the discourse, and therefore it will not be the goal of the listener’s attention.","[306, 307]"

frequent in the data.",[259]

factors: (i) the existence of another combination, chi in, which is similar in shape and
which exhibits similar behavior; (ii) the elements in the combination seem not to have thesame value that they have when they appear by themselves in other contexts. This is
especially true for chi in. We can have two morphemes chiin the same clause, but with
different positions and functions:(5)ine chi chiin

ka'ne/kande|We could speculate that the “missing” form in the chart would be the personal
pronoun ine, which originally could have been a demonstrative pronoun rather than a
personal one. Interestingly, some consultants say that in general they do not use the
personal pronoun in conversation, but rather they use the 3rd Absolutive enclitic in the
verb (i.e. ma-n rather than ine ma for ‘He eats.’). The personal pronoun ine is used
when one wants to point to the referred entity, instead of merely mentioning it.
However, if ine was originally a demonstrative pronoun, now it seems to be only a
personal one, because its use as modifier of a head noun in an NP seems not to be
possible, or at least it is controversial. According to one consultant, this example would
be acceptable:
(51)[ine axos yiJ-ki

‘I beat that child.’chi_in
ha fa.
Foc/Tens 1 _ beat° There is one example that suggests that the difference between nina and ina is not only one of distance,
but also proximity in relation to locutor or interlocutor: in a letter to a friend, a Trumai used nina (here)
when refering to her own village and ina (there) when referring to the friend’s village.

‘In contrast (in this other situation), if we do not kill anything, we will take time.’34The example above was not spontaneously given by a speaker, but it was rather
constructed on the basis of patterns observed in the language and presented to the
consultant for an opinion. So, even though the consultant accepted the example, the
question remains whether she really says it. A similar example was presented to another
consultant, who refused the use of ine as modifier, saying that it did not make sense:
(52)a.ni’demisu‘this mirror’this(masc) water/mirror
b. ka’ne

that(masc) water/mirror‘that mirror’c. *ine misu?*he mirror’ (strange, nonsense)Therefore, it seems that ine is a personal pronoun indeed. The question is to know
if it was originally the medial demonstrative pronoun (with the full demonstrative set
being: ni’de - ine - ka’ne‘this’ - ‘that’ -‘yon’) or if Trumai has another form for themedial demonstrative pronoun.","[59, 60]"
"75The Trumai postpositions are presented below. Contrary to what was said in
previous work (Guirardello 1992), postpositions in Trumai have independent stress.
lots’

tam‘Ablative’
‘Instrumental’
‘Comitative’nik‘Without’(h)ita‘Allative’”®What are the differences and similarities between the case markers and the
postpositions? The difference is that the case markers are phonologically bound forms,
while postpositions are free. The similarity is that both occur at the end of the NP, not on
its head, as we would expect for the case markers if they were suffixes instead of
enclitics. This fact could lead us then to the question: are the Trumai case markers merely
cliticized postpositions? We could say yes, because of the similarity in the site of location*8 The Allative postposition is represented with the initial sound h in parentheses because we are not sure
about its occurrence (some few consultants claim that there is an initial h , but not the other consultants).
The Allative seems to have another allomorph, ata, attested in only 2 cases:
(i)
ham ata
‘to where’
(ham ‘where, which place’)
(ii)
in ata
‘to it (it=meeting) °
(in ‘it’)
Since ham and in seem to be pronominal forms, we could say that ata is the Allative allomorph used with
pronouns. However, it is not so clear that this is the best analysis, because: (a) (h)ita is also attested with
pronouns (example (iii) below); (b) the other postpositions do not have special allomorphs for pronominalforms (example (iv) below). It might be that the allomorph ara is simply morphologically conditioned,
occurring only with ham and in.

A final remark with regard to the postposition (h)ita: sometimes it can alternate with the Dative
marker -ki, which can also mark ‘location’ if motion is involved. The difference between (h)ita and -ki is
that with -ki, the entity performing the motion reaches its target (cf. chapter 7)76(following the NP) and because the case markers probably were originally postpositions
that now are on their way to becoming affixes. However, this does not mean that NPs
modified by postpositions and case markers all have the same status. As we will see in
chapter 7, there are motivations for treating the NPs marked as ‘Ergative and ‘Dative’ as
distinct from the NPs modified by the other case markers and from the NPs modified by
postpositions.","[100, 101, 102]"
"186being used, perhaps because the cleft was already losing its force and needed to be
renewed. In modern data, in can be found in questions following NPs with WH-words (cf.
section 2.2.3). So, the configuration of clefts changed to:
obliqueka in[NPVerb in nominalized form]obliquechiin[NPVerb in nominalized form]As said before, over time the nominalizations of verbs were reanalyzed as verbs in
the infinitive. The NPs that were their possessors were reanalyzed as their S/O arguments,
and the other NPs were reanalyzed as A/DAT arguments:
A/DAT
A/DATka in
chiin[O/S_
[O/SVerb]
Verb]At some moment in the history of the language (stage 3), the cleft construction
replaced the main clause, that is, it became the norm instead of a special kind of clause
(Heine & Reh 1984 attest a similar development in African languages). This was
especially true for clauses that were an answer to a question (in the modern language, we
can see that answers tend to have the presence of ka_in or chi_in). The sequences ofmorphemes ka + in and chi + in started being seen not as mere linear sequences of
morphemes, but as morphemes in association. They were reanalyzed as units, becoming
now markers of focus which, at the same time, would carry tense information too. Later,in some cases, their use became optional. We know this because not all modern clauses
have the presence of ka_in or chi_in; however, the morphosyntax of the modern clauseswith ka_in/chi_in and the ones without them is basically the same: the original NP
possessor became Absolutive NP; the verb is “naked”, without inflectional marks. If the187Absolutive NP is not right before the verb because it is in focus or it is separated from the
verb by an adverb, there is a morpheme Xe after the verb. These morphosyntactic facts are
true for all main clauses, with or without ka_in/chi_in. Therefore, they came from the
same source (clefts),!° and if some of the modern clauses do not present the Focus/Tenseparticles, it is because these particles became non-obligatory (the clauses without them
would have not completive focus, but neutral focus, that is, no element under focus). In

Besides the African languages cited in Heine and Reh (1984), such complete replacement of old main
clause verbal systems is attested in the Cariban family (cf. Gildea 1998).
'! Observe that the same developments can be proposed for the construction where the whole clause would
be under focus, such as:
‘It is the monkey screaming.’the monkey’s scream Copula[NP V-nzd] Cop
{NP V-zd]
[S VJ]Copin
Copin[SV](cop in)or188These historical developments had several consequences, generating the following
results:
(i) the “creation” of the Focus/Tense particles chi_in and ka_in. The parts of the units
(ka/chi and in) are still not completely fused into a single form, since the sequence can
stillbe broken by adverbs, but they do form a semantic unit, being intimatelyassociated, despite the presence of possible adverbs between them. This also explains the
presence of a reflex of the modern Copula chi in chi_in.(ii) SV and OV are VPs, “preserving” the fact that S and O used to form a constituent
with the element that was originally their possessed noun and that is now the verb. Given
that, S and O have fixed position - right before the verb.","[211, 212, 213, 214]"

(77)k’awixu-s
rain-Dat
‘in the rainy season (lit: in the (time of) rains)’The non-obligatory arguments presented above can all be analyzed as a kind of
goal, either more concrete - as the goal of a movement - or more abstract, as the purpose
of an action or the benefactive (which is an indirect goal of the event). The NPs that referto ‘being in a time’ can be seen as an extension of the location-goal (with the “location”
here being temporal).
So, in some sense, the occurrence of the Dative markers with these non-obligatory
participants is parallel to their occurrence with the second participant of verbs such as
‘hit’ or ‘suck’ (as mentioned in section 7.1.3, the second participants of such verbs have a
location-goal nature).
In other words, the function of the markers -(V)tl, -ki, and -(V)s is to markelements that are semantically a kind of goal for the event, independent of whether the
element is obligatory or not. Therefore, semantically speaking, the occurrence of the
Dative markers with non-obligatory participants is not problematic, since they can be also
be seen as ‘goal’ participants. The problem is with regard to the obligatory status of the285NP: when a clause presents more than one NP marked as Dative, how can we determine
which NP is an obligatory argument, and which one is not? For example:
(78)— tsuliyika_inchamlomakesida-s_miso-es.river.turtle IYI Foc/Tens early
eat KE leaf-Dat full.river-Dat
‘In the time of full river, the river turtle eats leaves early.’It seems to us that the best strategy for that is to compare the clause in question with other
clauses where the same verb is used. By the comparison, we can see which subtype of
Dative participant is consistently required by the verb; the participant that is obligatory
will be the one that is consistently present in all the clauses.
However, as already mentioned, sometimes obligatory participants can be absent
from the clause because of discourse continuity (i.e. zero anaphora) or because ofpragmatic questions (i.e. the participant is suppressed because it is indefinite or has low
discourse importance; cf. chapter 9 on voice manipulation). Thus, if the Dative
participant under investigation is not present in some clauses, we have to analyze the
conditions that motivate its absence: is the participant absent because of discourse/
pragmatic questions? Or is the participant omitted because it was just extra information
that can de dropped anyway? A ‘goal’ participant that is obligatory will be omitted only
in certain circumstances, while the one that is not obligatory can be omitted in any case.
Of course, the strategy presented above is not the most desirable one, because it
involves some interpretation from the linguist in deciding if a ‘goal’ participant is
obligatory or not. The ideal situation would be to have a clear way of distinguishing the
two (such as a different marking for ‘goal’ participants that are not obligatory). However,286when we are describing a natural language, we do not always find ideal situations; on the
contrary, we often find scenarios that are a little fuzzy. In order to avoid incoherence in
our description of the Trumai case-marking system (presented in section 7.1.2), we used
the best exemplars of clauses typically Intransitive and Transitive, because in these
examples the usage is clear. For the fuzzy cases like the ones presented in this section, we
need a more careful analysis. For the present work, that is the possible account that we
can offer for the occurrence of the Dative markers with participants of the kind
‘benefactive’, ‘purpose’, etc.","[311, 312, 313, 314]"

"296Again, we have the question: why do we need the traditional grammatical
relationships of Subject, Object, etc., to talk about Trumai? We do not. For the purpose of
describing the grammar of this language, such relations are not necessary. They would be
interesting for the purpose of doing typological studies, that is, if we want to compare
Trumai to other languages of the world. However, there is not much to say about the
category of Subject in Trumai. If we consider Givon’s idea that a language with few
subject properties has only a slightly grammaticalized subject, then we can say that the
grouping {S,A} could be considered the Subject of Trumai, but it would be a Subject in
the very first steps to grammaticalization. It may be showing its first manifestations in the
control of anaphoric elements, as examples (79-81) above suggest, but there are still
tremendous limitations. Perhaps in future research, careful analysis of texts can bring to
light facts that help us to better define a category of Subject for Trumai.
The relationship among the obligatory arguments types of Trumai may be better
understood if we do not talk about them in terms of Subject, Object, Indirect Object, but
rather if we talk in terms of ‘Core’ versus ‘Peripheral’ arguments. In the next section, we
present an alternative way of analyzing this relationship.","[323, 324]"
"IYI-3Abs‘It (something) is not water’{not existential meaning]6.3.3. Negation in possessive predicatesThe Negation particle tak is used for both inalienable and alienable possessive
predicates, negating the verb. In the case of alienable possession, the negator modifies
k’ad ‘to have’. In the case of inalienable possession, the negator tak modifies the
nominal root that indicates the possessed entity (and that behaves as the verb of the
clause; cf. section 5.2.6). For instance:(56)sapaun
soapka_in

Negke hachi.
KE | Cop‘I do not have soap.’(57)ato tak

sense, through the use of the postposition nik:

ka_in = hachi.
salt without Foc/Tens 1 Cop
‘I do not have salt.’The inalienable possessive predicate also has an alternative way of expressing
negative sense, through the use of the word t(a)ke ‘Privative’. Although it is not clear as
yet, the use of t(a)ke here seems to imply that the subject has never possessed the object
in question. For instance, (60) probably means that the speaker has never had a sister, as243opposed to a person who does not have a sister because she died. We raise this hypothesis
on the basis of other occurrences of t(a)ke, where the sense of ‘never’ is evoked.
However, the semantics of example (60) need to be rechecked, in order to confirm ordisconfirm our hypothesis.

they can present both nominal and verbal-predicate word orders (i.e., Adj Subj(Cop)orSubj Adj), and also because when in the negative modality, they have the negator tak
occurring with the nominal order, while anuk occurs with the verbal one; in other words,

can employ the morpheme n(i)kik:244(63)nacha-nkikka_inha chi.curvedFoc/Tens1Cop‘I am not curved.’

"201If ke here is a Relativizer, then [disi ke] means ‘one who kills’ and it is a nominalpredicate (the Copula is not presented here, but as mentioned in chapter 3 (section 3.5)
the Copula does not always occur in a nominal predicate). In this case, shouldn’t the
“subject” [kiki wan] ‘men’ be in the Absolutive? Instead, it is [pelasawak] ‘tapir’ that is
in the Absolutive, but tapirs are not the killers here, they are rather the killed ones. The
nominalizer for ‘patient’ is -t’(a), not -k(e) (cf. chapter 3, section 3.2). Therefore, it doesnot seem adequate to say that ke in (76) is a Relativizer, and that this example is an
instance of a cleft construction.
An alternative analysis would explain the morphosyntax of a cleft as indicating
the historical source of the modern construction, but would argue that, as in the case ofthe clefts for old obliques/NP Possessors that became main clauses (as argued in section
5.1.3), the construction has been reanalyzed into a standard clause type. Thus, thepresence of the Copula, the morpheme ke relativizing the verb, and the Negation particle
anuk would be explained. However, both the construction and the morpheme ke would
have changed their status as the construction was used more and more. Finally, it would

optional in the negative clauses would be evidence for reanalysis. The question is to

{the implicit DAT here is the interlocutor, the person who asked for a hammock]For clauses with Extended Intransitive verbs, the pragmatic suppression of the NP
marked as Dative has two semantic effects: (i) antipassive interpretation (i.e. the
“patient”-like participant is demoted from the scene); (ii) reflexive interpretation. Thebasic principle behind the suppression is that the “patient”/second participant is not
explicitly expressed because it is not discursively important, or simply because there is no
external second participant (the entity performs the event on him/her/itself).
The reflexive effect is observed with Ist and 2nd person subjects, and it was
exemplified in chapter 8 (section 8.2.2). With regard to the antipassive effect, we observe
that when a Trumai speaker is referring to an event that is habitual, and the “patient’’/
second participant is completely irrelevant for what is being said about the event, the
“patient” can be omitted from the clause. For example:
(41)hama kate-ki.
1 eat fish-Dat
‘T ate a fish.’(42)hama k’atsi
1 eat be.seatedhuk’an.

by the kids), so the Dative NP ‘manioc bread’ is present in the clause]354(44)ha adifle dakchi
huk’an.
1 sister work.w/hand still
‘My sister is still making (manioc bread).’
[there are some activities that can be done with the hands, but the most referred to and
usual one is ‘to make manioc bread’, so ‘manioc bread’ here is implicit by the cultural
context. It does not need to be mentioned]The case of the omission of the DAT argument of Extended Transitive verbs is a
little more complicated. In general, the recipient NP of such verbs is omitted because it
can be recovered by context. However, there are examples in which the Dative NP is
omitted because apparently it does not matter who the recipient is. For instance:

IYI4)‘He did not give (it) away.’The question is to determine whether in the examples above there is suppression of the
Dative because of pragmatic questions (i.e. recipient is unimportant), or rather because it
can be recoverable by the context (i.e. a Dative NP such as ‘to anybody’ would be
implicit in the examples). And, in case the suppression is due to pragmatic factors, how
should we label the semantic effect obtained here? It could not be classified as an
antipassive, since the Dative NP here is not “patient”-like. It is difficult to answer these
questions; that is why the absence of the Dative NP in a Extended Transitive clause is
hard to analyze. However, at least, one point can be made here: if the suppression is355indeed pragmatically driven, then we can say that the principle behind the omission of the
Dative NP of a Extended Transitive verb is the same as the Dative NP of Extended
Intransitive verbs: when the DAT argument is unimportant or irrelevant, it is not
expressed in the clause, being taken out of the scene; that would occur independently ofthe semantic role of the DAT argument (i.e “patient”-like or recipient).","[380, 381, 382, 383]"

clause has an Intransitive verb, the non-presence of the enclitic coding the Absolutive
argument gives to the clause a generic sense with regard to the initiator of the event (i.e.
an event is happening, but we do not know who exactly is performing it). If the clause has
a Transitive verb, the omission of the enclitic can signal that O has little discursiveimportance, that is, it produces an antipassive sense. This point will be discussed in more
detail in chapter 9 (section 9.1.1).
There is one case in which the absence of -n/-e is not linked to semantic/pragmatic
questions: it is when the negator tak occurs in the verb phrase. As mentioned before, the
3Abs enclitic occurs attached to the verb or to one of its modifiers (i.e., an auxiliary, theCausative or Intensity particle, or an adverb). However, if the verb is modified by the
Negation particle tak, the enclitic is completely omitted, without necessarily creating a
generic or antipassive sense. The absence of the enclitic here apparently has to do with
morphological incompatibility between -n/-e and the negator tak rather than with
semantic or pragmatic factors. For instance:
(35)a. hai-ts ka_in

1-Erg Foc/Tens bus
‘T will pay the bus.’pap
payhat’ke.
in.futureb. hai-ts ka_in
pap tak = hat’ke.
1-Erg Foc/Tens bus Neg in.future
‘I will not pay it.’
[no enclitic in the verb, although the Absolutive head noun is not present]what would be the status of the possessed noun mut ‘dress/shirt’, since the possessor “ascended” to the
status of O (or S, in the case of example (33b): ‘He is swollen (at) the nose’, rather than “his nose isswollen.’). There is another possible analysis, presented in chapter 9 (section 9.1.2.2).","[122, 123]"
"Looking at the patterns presented above, we can see that there is only one way of
expressing permanent characteristics, but two ways of expressing temporary states.
Attributive predicates that indicate permanent characteristics are probably simple nominal
predicates, with the adjective nominalized by ke behaving in the same way as nouns. The205question is to understand the nature of the attributive predicates that indicate temporary
states. Let us first realign them strictly on the basis of word order:
affirmative:
negative:Adj
Subj (Cop)
Adj tak Subj (Cop)Subj Adj
Subj Adj anukLooking at the negative modality, we observe that when the order is nominal, the
negator is verbal, and conversely, when the order is verbal, the negator is nominal. In
other words, the negator has always opposite “polarity” in relation to the word order.
However, a problem remains: what are the semantic differences between the two
ways of expressing temporary states? So far, the only difference that could be detected
was due to pragmatic factors: the Subj Adj or Adj Subj (Cop) order is selected depending
on which information the speaker wants to highlight:
(83)kafe
coffeeyi
YIsupi.
bitter‘The coffee is bitter.” (comment)(84)supika_inkafeyi.bitter Foc/Tens coffee YI
‘The coffee is bitter (new info).’ (answer to the question: Is the coffee sweet?)In sum, it seems that the more adequate way of understanding attributive
predicates in Trumai is to take into account whether the attribute being expressed is
permanent or temporary. If permanent, we have a nominalized adjective in a nominal
predicate and no further complications. If temporary, we have a “hybrid” predicate, with
two possibilities: (i) nominal syntax but not-nominal nucleus (and consequently, notnominal Negation particle); (ii) verbal syntax but not-verbal nucleus and not-verbal206Negation particle. We could go deeper into this issue and explore the nature of adjectives
in general. As some scholars point out, adjectives refer to entities that are more timestable than verbs, but less than nouns (Givén 1984). This being so, it is not surprising that
in some languages adjectives shows properties of both nouns and verbs, since they
constitute an in-between category. Perhaps the temporal attributive predicates in Trumai
play along with this in-between nature, oscillating between nominal (permanent) or verbal
(temporary) characteristics. Could we say that an attributive temporal predicate with
nominal syntax indicates a slightly less temporary attribute than one with verbal syntax?
Or is the choice of a nominal or verbal syntax conditioned only by the same pragmatic
factors which condition order changes in verbal predicates? This remains a point for
further research.","[230, 231, 232]"
"When the order is [S Pred], alternation between -s and -is is possible (although theuse of -s with words ending in vowels is preferred):

“When I eat, I want to sleep.’
b. ha ma-is hayotl take.
1 eat-IS 1 sleep Des
‘When I eat, I want to sleep.’A question is then raised: is the morpheme -(V)s here the same as the Dativemarker that occurs with NPs? In terms of allomorphy, the morpheme -(V)s here is
consistent with the Dative marker that occurs with NPs; that is, the Dative marker -(V)s
also presents the allomorphs -(i)s and -(e)s (cf. chapter 2, section 2.3). In terms of
semantics, there are also some similarities: the Dative marker -(V)s can also be foundmarking NPs that refer to time, with the sense of ‘(being) in the time’ (cf. chapter 7,
section 7.2.3.2). The problem is that, unlike the Dative-Complement clauses, theTemporal/Conditional clause is not nominalized; on the contrary, it can receive the 3Abs
enclitic. There is no evidence that the clause is being treated as a NP. The morpheme yi,
which occurs at the end of NPs, is not observed in Temporal clauses between the Verb +
3Abs and the marker -(V)s , that is, we do not find: [V-3Abs yi]-(V)s.",[420]

here, the speaker has less respect for the person who is the subject of the talk perhaps a more casual speech]In relation to the occurrence of the Copula in dialogues, some remarks need to be
made: observing the Trumai discourse, we can see that the morpheme chi is very frequent
in use. However, not all occurrences of the form chi represent the use of the Copula. We
have to distinguish between the chi ‘Copula’ and the chi whichis reduction of theFocus/Tense particle chi_in. Historically, the chi of the Focus/Tense particle came fromthe Copular use (cf. chapter 5 for details), but its modern function and meaning are now
different. In order to determine whether an occurrence of chi is the Copula or a reduced
form of [chi_in], we have to look at the distribution of the morpheme in question, since125chi ‘Copula’and chi reduction of [chi_in] occur in environments that are similar, butnot quite the same. Also, in elicitation the replacement of the occurrence of chi by the
whole unit /chi_in] is a good strategy for the differentiation, since the replacement is
allowed only when chi is the reduction of the Focus/Tense particle.'?","[149, 150, 151]"
"Trumai does not have a conjunction such as the English ‘and’ for the coordination
of NPs or clauses. That fact is not surprising; according to Mithun (1988: 332-336), many
languages do not have overt markers of coordination. Instead, they signal coordination
through intonation. The clauses are combined with no intonation break, or with what
Mithun calls a ‘coma intonation’, “...a pause and a special non-final pitch contour”
(Mithun: 332). Juxtaposition and intonation alone are enough to signal coordination of
noun phrases or clauses in these languages.
Juxtaposition and ‘coma intonation’ are used for the noun phrase coordination in
Trumai (cf. chapter 2, section 2.1). In the case of coordination of clauses, the matter is
more complex. There are three attested ways to combine clauses. The question is whether
we can call any of them real instances of ‘coordination’.(i) in one case, we have the strategy described by Mithun: two clauses are juxtaposed, and
they are under the same intonational contour (the short pause between them is non-final).
There is no explicit connector linking them, only the intonation. The relationship between
the clauses is equal; each one has its own autonomy and can be used independently.

"The Trumai tap is /r/, and the liquids are /I/ and //. The lateral fricative wasanalyzed in previous works as an allophone of /I/ following /t/ (Becquelin 1975;
Guirardello 1992), but it is better analyzed as a separate phoneme because: (i) it is notclear that a /t/ really precedes the lateral fricative (as already mentioned in Guirardello
1992, sometimes the realization of the sound seems to be ['t], sometimes only [%]); (ii)given the phonetic presence of [t], the sequence [t?] would be better analyzed as another
complex segment rather than a cluster, for phonotactic reasons: there are no other cases of
the combination stop + liquid, and as mentioned above we do not find the syllable type
CCV or VCC with other consonants; (iii) at least one minimal pair was found: [ka'le]‘thus’ - [ka'te] ‘small.lizard’. The only question in need of further research is whether the
phoneme is better treated as a lateral fricative or an affricate (i.e. /t/ or /tt/). For the
moment, it will be treated as a lateral fricative, until we find more evidence of its
phonological alignment with either the affricate or the fricatives.
Finally, the Trumai approximants are /w/ and /j/. The approximant /j/ becomes a
palatal nasal when it is followed by the sequence vowel + nasal consonant. For example:
/ajen/ [a'nén] ‘grandfather’, /ajena?i/ [anéna?'i] ‘wild.rat’, /kujan/ [ku'pan] ‘grass’.

Reflexive and middle situations are similar in one regard and different in another.

its effects. The difference is that reflexive situation types involve events thatprototypically encode two participants, one that performs the action (agent/executor), the‘Example (27b) is actually ambiguous: the person got combed in some way, probably by herself/himself
