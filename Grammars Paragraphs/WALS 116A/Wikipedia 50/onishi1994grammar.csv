In an interrogative sentence, with a question word, or with the intonation of a polar
question (cf. §2.6), Definite Future is used as a rhetorical question:
15-83he'ee!tikoua-kokumar-opee?nosowhat-PURPlaugh-lS.DEFFUT'No! So why should I laugh?' (VIII-15)Tense/ Aspect/Mood15-84461ro-kimeengtaapu-mor-i-hee?you.sg-ERGexactlyhelp-1 pcl.exc-2A-DEFFUT'You really could help us(= How could you help us)?' (XIV-27)
The reference point of time may not be the speech moment, but may be supplied
from the context. It could be some time in the future (as in 15-85), or in the past (as in
15-86 and 15-87).
(i) the speaker predicts that an event or a state will take place immediately after the•point
of reference:

"35Phonology(3) In polar interrogative sentences: the final stressed mora has a rising pitch which is
followed by a sharp falling contour of the rest of the moras. In Figure 2-14 in page 34,
the segment aai in paaina shows a rising in F0 at the beginning, which is followed by a
sharp falling in F0 in the latter half of the segment.
(4) The discourse markers nee and nehe play a similar role to tag questions in English
(§9.1.4 and §9.1.5). They may be placed at the end of a sentence, or after the first
word in a sentence. In the former case, the first mora ne is pronounced with a sharp
rising pitch, which is followed by a sharp falling pitch of the second morae in nee'' or
he in nehe (cf. F0 extract of nehe in Figure 2-15 below). In the latter case nee and neheare marked by the same kind of rising and falling pitch (cf. F0 extract of nehe in Figure
2-16 in page 36). The intonation pattern of the end of the sentence is just like that of a
declarative sentence in such a case. Compare the F0 contour of aai of paaina in Figure
2-16 with that in Figure 2-12.","[63, 64]"

Dependent embedded clauses with verbs in Defmite Future function as the Complements or the peripheral arguments of the superordinate predicates, and may either
precede or follow them.
Verbs which take Definite Future verbal clauses as Complements include haa- 'to
agree/want' and kaah- 'to disagree/not to want' (§ 14.3.1.1), haa-jee- 'to need/want'
(§14.6.1), tiik- 'to say' (§14.3.1.2), mi'no- 'to instruct sb' and tiih- 'to tell sb'
(§ 14.3.2.1).
As peripheral arguments, they indicate the purpose of the action referred to by the
superordinate verb.

In 4-13, the plural number of poo 'ki is indicated by the suffix -ngung on the noun and
on the adjectival Complement pehkita, and is cross-referenced by the 3rd paucal/plural
S inflection of the stem of the copula verb, uruu-juu. See also 4-9.
The underlying forms of number suffixes are listed below. Kinship terms and
classifiers have different systems of number markings. See §4.4.4 and §8.2.
Table 4-3Underlying Forms of Number SuffixesSingular-0Dual-karoPaucal-naaPlural-ngungNote that the attachment of a number suffix to a noun is optional. It is not used
when the number of the object in question is obvious from the context. Inanimate
nouns c;lo not usually inflect for dual and paucal. 7
Examples:
4-14kupuri 'a stone/stones'
kupuri-ngung '(many) stones'I could find no examples of inanimate nouns marked by the dual or the paucal suffix in my corpus.
According to my informants, however, they can be marked by either of these if the duality or paucality
of the object referred to by the noun is focused on.
7Nouns4-1573nommai 'a person/people'
nommai-karol-ngaro 'two persons'
nommai-naa 'a few/several persons'
nommai-ngung '(many) people'The initial /k/ of the dual suffix /-karol is often realised as ng. A similar phenomenon
is observed as regards all the case suffixes which begin with /k/ (the ergative /-kif, the
purposive /-ko/, the ablative /-kitee/ and the locative /-koril). The morphophonemic
processes which apply to all these suffixes are informally summarised as follows.''
Rule 4-1Realisation of /kl in the Dual Suffix /-karol and Other SuffixesWhen /k/ is preceded by the archinasal IN/, it is obligatorily realised as ng.
It is realised either k or ng when it is preceded by a sequence of a nasal or avelar stop and a vowel, or by a high or back vowel. The more phonemes of
this type exist in adjacent syllables, the more it is likely to be realised as
ng.sExamples:
4-16nungamong-ngaro 'two men'
koringono-karo/-ngaro 'two enemies'
poo'ki-karo/-ngaro 'two babies'
kuraisa-karo/-ngaro 'two women'

However, when case suffixes are preceded by pronouns, the article or the demonstrative, lkJ may be
realised asj, or may be fused with preceding vowels. cf. Chs 5 and 6. See also Rule 4-5 in §4.4 for
special morphophonemic rules which apply to the ergative suffix.

sentence may be uttered by anyone in such a situation:
4-18muumaa-naa, reewoopi- '=tuiee?lord-pcwherego.2S-pcl.PRESPROG .DPyou.nonsg'My lord, where are you going?'
In the following sentence, the speaker addresses his brother-in-law in dual form (cf.
§9.4.2 for a discussion of the form po-owoi-nno): 9

go downstream.' (V-17)4.3 SEMANTIC CATEGORIES INDICATED BY CLASSIFIERS
Apart from the two obligatory grammatical categories discussed above, the semantic
categories of the referents of nouns may optionally be indicated by classifiers. The
categories expressed by classifiers include 'human', 'animate', 'long object', 'concave
object', 'taro', 'stone', 'human habitation', 'day', etc.
Classifiers are always combined with various bound morphemes, or nouns or verbal
clauses. Classifier constructions thus formed may be juxtaposed to head nouns, may
be employed in headless noun phrases, or may function as NP heads by themselves. I
have attested fifty-one classifiers in my corpus and from elicitation.
Some nouns can take two or more different classifiers in different contexts. For
example, the human noun nommai 'person/people', which is either masculine or
feminine, can take the 'human' classifier -uru, the 'animate' classifier -wori 'animate',
the 'lot' classifier -ngu and the 'group of people' classifier -po injuxtaposition: 10The speaker could also use the paucal form po-owoi-naa (cf. 4-102c in §4.4.4.1.3) to address him,
and verbal forms with a paucal subject such as taapu-r-ong-hee, pi-'-hee.","[101, 102, 103]"

"Masayuki OnishiAcknowledgementsFirst of all, I would like to express my gratitude to three ladies, without whose
assistance this thesis would never have been completed.
Two of them come from Bougainville. Dora Leslie initiated me into her beautiful
language, taught me and answered my endless questions with utmost patience. Therese
Minitong Kemelfield told lots of interesting stories to me. Her fervent discussions on
Siwai culture were ever so inspiring. For both of them, the last four years must have
been the most dreadful time in their lives --- their mothers and other close relatives were
suffering from the political conflict on the island, and there was no way for them even
to communicate with their own people most of the time. In spite of this frustrating
situation, they never failed to address me with warmth in their hearts. All their family
members living in Australia have become very good friends of my family as well.
Ulrike Mosel, my supervisor in chair, assisted me to write the thesis from beginning
to end with meticulous care. Before starting my PhD, I was virtually a novice in
writing a grammar. I saw the last four years as my apprenticeship, and she was the
most worthy Meisterin. She taught me not only how to write a grammar, but also how
to enjoy writing a grammar. Her liberal and flexible way of thinking very often saved
me from mental exhaustion.
R.M.W. Dixon, my other supervisor, encouraged me to work on this interesting
language, and gave many important suggestions on every chapter of my thesis. I am
greatly indebted to him.
Two other Motuna speakers living in Australia --- Agnes Kennedy and Alex Dawuia
--- provided some language data and were very helpful during my field work. I am
grateful to both of them.
I owe a great deal to other researchers in the languages and cultures of Bougainville
people, especially to Douglas Oliver who worked on the Siwai culture, and to Conrad
and Phyllis Hurd who worked on the Nasioi language. Conrad Hurd kindly provided
me with some valuable data in Nasioi, and helped me getting unpublished materials
from the Summer Institute of Linguistics.
I am also grateful to the Australian National University and the Department of
Employment, Education and Training for the financial assistance provided through anANU PhD Scholarship and an Overseas Postgraduate Research Scholarship, respectively.
This thesis actually started when I took the ""Field Methods"" course conducted by
R.M.W. Dixon in the second semester of 1990. Dora was the informant in this course,
and there were nine other students--- Anna Scott, Hugh Sainty, Jason McDonald, John
Schooneveldt, Karen Gillespie, Peggy Daroesman, Ruth Chisholm, Tim Curnow, and
Xiaonong Zhu. I benefited enormously from their discussion on this language.
My other teachers and fellow students made helpful comments and suggestions on
different parts of my thesis at different times. Detailed comments were made by Phil
Rose, Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald and Tom Dutton on some of the chapters. Phil Rose,
in addition, gave me various technical advice on the phonetic analysis of my data during
the busiest time of his teaching. Tom Dutton, my advisor, also assisted me in some
technical matters. I am grateful to all of them.
I am a late comer in the arena of linguistics. Although I had long been interested in
·languages, I had never studied linguistics seriously until I came to Canberra in 1989.
In that year I was taught an introduction to linguistics and sociolinguistics by Elisabeth
Patz in the University of Canberra, as a TESOL student. Her excellent lectures determined the direction of my study. In the following year I was enrolled in the ANU, and
since then, I have had ample opportunities to investigate different areas of linguistics
with the assistance of teachers, fellow students and visitors. Among them were Anna
Wierzbicka, Phil Rose and Harold Koch, and my supervisors mentioned above. My
debt is to all the people I encountered in the course of my linguistic studies. This thesis
is in a way a summary of what I have learned from them in the last few years in
Canberra.
My final word of thanks is due to Ayuko, Takashi and our newly-born little Motona.
They created a joyful family environment which I regard as the most valuable thing in
my life. I could get myself refreshed whenever I spent time with them. Our second
son's name was taken from the language name ""Motuna"" with slight modification
according to Japanese phonology. His name will always remind me and my family of
the years we spent in Canberra, and of our special friendship with Motuna speakers.iiAbstractThis thesis is a descriptive grammar of Motuna, a Non-Austronesian language
spoken by several thousand people in the south-western part of Bougainville (called
Siwai), Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Buin Family of the Eastern Bougainville
stock, in the Bougainville Phylum. This grammar is based on the analysis of narrative
texts provided by four speakers of the standard Motuna.
Motuna is a both head and dependent marking agglutinative language with complex
morphology. Like most Non-Austronesian languages in Papua NewGuinea, it is verb
final, and has medial and non-medial verbal categories. In addition, verbs have basic
voice distinction between active and middle voices, and have extensive tense/aspect/mood categories. Nouns have six genders and are also classified by fifty-one
classifiers.
Chapter 1 discusses the typological characteristics, as well as the genetic relations
and dialectal variations of Motuna. It also briefly summarises previous work done on
this language, and provides the scope and data base of this thesis.
Chapter 2 deals with phonetics, phonology and orthography. It includes an introduction to morphophonemics which will be discussed fully in later chapters, particularly in
Chapter 4 (nouns), Chapter 8 (classifiers, numerals and the 'all' quantifier), and
Chapter 13 (verbal morphology).
Chapter 3 outlines the word-classes and the clausal syntax of this language. Chapters 4 - 9 deal with the mopho-syntax of all the word classes except for verbs, participles and verbal nouns. Chapter 10 discusses the internal structure of the NP, and
Chapter 11 possessive, kinship and other constructions.
Chapter 12 outlines the morpho-syntax of verbs. I give a gist of verbal morphology
in this chapter, so that readers may skip Chapter 13 which is a lengthy discussion of
complicated verbal morphology. Chapter 14 discusses valency of verbs including
valency-changing derivations (stimulative, causative, applicative and reciprocal).
Chapter 15 deals with tense/aspect/mood. Chapter 16 deals with two word classes
derived from verbs .,.-- verbal nouns and participles.
Chapter 17 discusses the interclausal relations in Motuna, mainly chaining of medial
verbs and relative clauses.
Finally, three narative texts of this language are provided in Appendix.iiiContents

(*mi)
nee'O.K.?, we (inclusive)'(*ne)There are, however, reasons to assume that sequences of two identical vowels in
some open disyllabic words underlyingly constitute just single vowels.
In Motuna, the article and most personal pronouns have CVV forms when they are in
absolutive case. However, when they take the ergative suffix /-ki/, some of them retain
the original two identical vowels, while others take single ones. For example,
in absolutive case

or dual-paucal gender has the same form as that in local gender, in absolutive case.
However, their forms are different in ergative case.
In the above cases, morphological analysis will be simpler if we assume that the
difference of surface vowel length in ergative case comes from that of the underlying20Chapter 2vowel length, i.e.: 16

words to surface as a sequence of two identical vowels:
Rule 2-7Vowel Lengthening of Underlying Open Mono-syllabic Wordsvi -> vyi 1 #(C) _ #
In addition to sequences of two identical vowels mentioned above, Motuna allows
many types of sequences of two or more vowels. All the combinations attested so far
are given below:
1) Sequences of two vowels (include all the sequences which end with /if, lui and /a/):/ail, /ui/, /ei/, /oil
/au/, !iu/, /eu/, lou/
lial, !ual, leal, loaf/io/16There are other pieces of evidence which support this assumption:( 1) all singular personal pronouns, in their bound forms, take short vowels, while nonsingular
pronouns take long vowels. This applies to possessive and reflexive pronouns as well. cf. Tables 4-7,
5-3 and 5-4.
(2) When the emphatic suffix /-ko/ is attached, only the vowel of the masculine form of the article, hoo
-sao, can optionally be shortened (cf. §9.3).
As regards other mono-syllabic words with long vowels, there are no reason to assume that they
have different underlying forms, since the forms with short vowels never occur. They include:
maa 'faeces', haa 'thing, I wonder', mii 'name, knee, before I have gone',jii 'and', tuu
'water', kuu 'inside', nee 'O.K.?', noo 'possibly'Phonology212) Sequences of three vowels (the sequences which end with /i/ frequently occur in
verbal forms, but others are found only in a few words):
/aai/, /uuil, /eei/, /ooi/
/aau/, liau/
/aia/, /uia/, /eua/
/aio/, /uio/, /oio/, /iuo/, /uuo/
3) Sequences of four vowels (rare):/aaui/, /eeui/, liaai/, liuai/,
/aauu/, /eeuu/

2.4.1 Syllable Structure
The syllable structure of Motuna is represented as:
Diagram 2-6Syllable Structure(j'0/IRI~ CN
IvIC 1 can be any consonant except /HI, /Q/ and IN/. C 2 can be either /HI, /Q/ or IN/.
As we have seen in §2.3, all vowel sequences are analysed as sequences of single
vowels, which constitute the nuclei of separate syllables.
C 2 consonants are not followed by a vowel. 17 Now, the underlying forms of some
suffixes may have an archinasal at the beginning. 1 8 When such a suffix is attached to a
word ending with a C 2 , 19 C 2 must be ""articulated"" to a C 1V sequence, in order to avoid
an unperrnissible C 2 N sequence. cf. §2.7.3.
17The interjections ehe'ehee 'hi, hi, hi (imitation of laughter)', u'uung 'yes', he'ee 'no' and hu'uung
'no' are exceptions. The glottal stop /Q/ is directly followed by the vowel /e/ and /u/ in these words.
cf. §9.5.
18 I allow sequences, which are not permissible in surface syllable structure, in the underlying forms
of bound morphemes. For example, many verb roots end with consonants which can not occur in coda
position. e.g. /kuuk-/ 'to know', /hoHk-/ 'to throw sth towards sb', /tokis-/ 'to cut'.
19There are no suffixes which begin with /HI or /Q/.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51]"

Two transitive verb stems, /haQh-/ 'to throw away' and /siiQh-/ 'to put oil on', have
alternative forms without a glottal stop, /haah-/ and /siih-/ respectively.
In the rest of the stems ending with a C2 C sequence, C2 consonants alternate with Ci
or Cu syllables. The form with Ci or Cu occurs only when the last consonant, in
combination with the 3rd person A suffix 1-u/, is dearticulated due to Rule 13-21
below. 27 For example,
13-35'he/she will definitely shake it'pa'r-u-hee
shake-30.3A-DEFFUT'idem'paki'-hee
shake.30.3A-DEFFUTIn 13-35, the transitive verb stem with a 3rd singular 0 and A pa'r-u alternates with the
form paki'. The glottal stop of paki' is the realisation of /Q/ formed due to an optional
dearticulation of the stem-final consonant /r-1 and the 3rd A suffix 1-u/. However, the
alternation of the glottal stop in the stem pa 'r- and ki in the form paki' cannot be
explained unless we posit the underlying form /pakir-/ for this verb stem. The lkil in
the stem is dearticulated to /Q/ when followed by a CV syllable?8
For this reason, I posit underlying forms in the shape of /CiC-/ or /CuC-1 for all the
verb stems which show similar alternations. They are listed below:
(1) stems which have /Q/ in C2 position. The underlying form of this archi-stop may belki/, /ku/, or ltul.

subcategorised as follows:
( 1) emotive interjections
(2) interjections for attracting attention
(3) interjections for response
(4) filler words
The endings of emotive interjections, and some interjections for response, are
characterised by a level high pitch (cf. §2.8).
Note that in some interjections, such as ehe;ehee 'laughter', u'uung 'yes', hu'uung
'no' and he'ee 'no', a glottal stop occurs between vowels, which is not permissible in
general phonotactic rules (cf. §2.4.1).","[243, 244, 245]"
"8.2.2.1.1The Free Form noiThe syntactic behaviour of noi is different from that of other numerals. In attribution, it usually occupies a post-head position, but not always, unlike other numerals
(cf. §10.3.3.4 and 10.3.4.2). It has special functions in negative sentences. It can
modify both countable and uncountable nouns, expressing ""indefiniteness"" in general.
There are gaps which neither of my main informants could fill. Especially the paradigms of those
numeral classifiers which are not often used in daily conversation are incomplete. See Table 8-2. They
must be filled by older speakers in the future. In my corpus of texts large numbers (such as year
numbers) are expressed by English numerals.",[208]

"2.2.2FricativesThe fricative /s/ [s] occurs in word initial or medial position before a vowel, but
cannot occur word-finally or before a consonant, except in loanwords such as kalabuus
'prison' (from kalabus in Tok Pisin), stoa 'store' (from English or Tok Pisin). e.g. saa
'side', siro 'song', harusu 'female turtle', musi'ka 'pain'.
· Distributionally, the occurrence of /s/ is restricted. In the majority of indigenous
words which contain /s/, /s/ is followed by /i/. A sequence of /s/ and /il in a loanword
corresponds to an alveolar or a postalveolar fricative or affricate in the original word.
For example,
sikuuna [stku:na]'schooner' (English or Tok Pisin)raisi [ratst]'rice' (English or Tok Pisin)siipi [si:pt]'ship' (English or Tok Pisin)sengsi [sest] - senisi [sentst]'change' (English) - 'senis' (Tok Pisin)Sometimes an affricate [tJ] or [d3] in the original word is retained. e.g. Dachi [datJt]
'Holland', tiicha [ti:tJa]- tiisia [ti:stja] 'teacher', Siapani [stapant]- Japani [d3apam]
'Japan/Japanese'.
The other fricative /hi [h] occurs much more commonly than /s/. e.g. hame 'taro',
heewa 'thing', iihaa 'fire'. As mentioned in §2.1, the phone [h] in coda position is
regarded as an archiphoneme /HI. Thus: /peHkita/ pehkita 'small', /muH/ muh 'bush',
/waasiiH/ waasiih 'story'.",[42]

unexpressed 0 or AAs discussed above, the choice between (1) and (3) depends on which argument is the
topic. (2) is used instead of (1) when A provides given information. The 0 NP, or the
A NP in ergative case, can be placed after the verb, when they provide new information
in the discourse. 15
In addition to core arguments, many transitive verbs can take NPs in absolutive case,
verbal nouns, verbal clauses with verbs in Definite Future TAM, or sentences in
quotation, as Complements. Examples of absolutive NPs functioning as the Complements of transitive verbs are given below (see §14.3.2.1, §14.5 and §14.6 for the

Complement status. (See also 3-24. See Ch 14 for a detailed discussion of valencychanging processes.)14Unless another absolutive NP denoting location precedes and functions as a topic. e.g. 3-15.","[89, 90]"

of the marked clause contrasts with that of the controlling clause. There is no referential overlap between the subjects of two clauses, except for the special constructions
discussed below (cf. 17-43).
When a DS medial clause is placed after an SS medial clause and before an SS
medial clause or a non-medial clause, it signals that:
( 1) the theme of the preceding clause is maintained in the DS clause, and the following
clause presents a new theme, or
(2) the theme of the preceding clause is maintained in the clause after the DS clause, and
the theme of the DS clause is a temporary diversion from it, 8 or
(3) the themes in the DS clause and the following clause contrast, but they are included
in the larger theme presented by the first SS clause.
In the following diagrams, II __.II indicates that the two clauses at both ends havethe same theme, and II .-.~~ indicates that they have different themes.",[541]

referred to by the head noun (cf. §10.3.4.6). The information presented by the relative
clause is often contrasted with the one given in the previous discourse.

not seem to be used very often.26
Note that /neQw-/ with middle suffixes (12-34) and /maap-/ with active (SA) suffixes
have exactly the same meaning. Similarly, /morik-/ 'to return' with active (SA) suffixes
seems to be the synonym of /turu-/ with middle suffixes ( 12-35). Which of the two
synonymous verbs in these pairs is used in a particular context largely depends on
social factors. In general, the words, whose initial syllables are identical with those of
tabooed names, are avoided. This is probably one of the major reasons why Motuna
has many pairs of synonymous words.","[300, 301]"

The realisation of the 1st person A suffix is as follows:
Rule 13-12Realisation of 1st Person A SuffixThe following rules apply before Rules 13-1- 13-5.
The 1st person A suffix, in singular, is combined with the following TAM
suffixes to take various forms:
(a) {1st A} -m -> -o-m
(b) {1st A} -k -> -ong
(c) {1st A} -w, -h -> -op
(d) {1st A} -r -> -oNn

(f) {1st A} -juu -> -osuu(g) {1st A} -u -> -ot-u
(h) {1st A} -o -> -om-o
It is realised as /-opi/ before the dual suffix /-til:(i) {1st A} -> -opi I_ -ti
In paucal/plural number, it, again, takes various forms. It fuses with the /r/
of the Perfect and Negative Optative suffixes, and /w/ of the Optative suffix
and the negative infix. It is realised as -opi word-finally, as -opi-r10 before
a vowel, and -oN in other environments.

The underlying form is regarded as /-opi-ru/, where the paucal/plu ral suffix /-ru/ is affected by
Rules 13-2 and 13-6.
10Verbal Morphology13.2.3307Irregular Intransitive VerbsMotuna has five intransitive verbs which mark the person of S by the consonant
alternation of their stems. Among them, three verbs --- /tu(h)-/ 'Copula, to be', /pi(h)-/
'to go', and /hu(h)-/ 'to come'--- mark the paucal/plural exclusiveness of 1st and 3rd
person Ss by the prefix /u-/. 11 The other two verbs --- /paa(h)-/ 'to cry' and /puu(h)-/
'to die'--- mark it by the suffix /-ral. (In all these verb stems, the stem-final consonant
!hi occurs only when they are followed by a derivational suffix.)The morphological structure of three irregular verbs, /tu(h)-/ 'Copula, to be', /pi(h)-/
'to go', and /hu(h)-/ 'to come', is:

§13.2.3.1 and §13.2.3.2, respectively. Except for Imperative forms, all the morphophonemic changes follow the rules described in §13.2.1, and I will not make comments
on them.
The paradigm· of /tu(h)-/ is defective. It has optional forms in Perfect (cf.

each form the dual suffix /-til may be interpreted as cross-referencing the number of
either A or 0:
(1) /tani-/ + /-~/ (30) + 1-il (2A) +/-til (dl) + 1-o/ (IMP),(2) /tani-/ + /-~/ (30) + 1-u/ (3A) +/-til (dl) + 1-o/ (IMP), where 1-u/ is assimilated to the

(4) /tani-/ + /-~/ (30) + 1-u/ (3A) +/-til (d1) + 1-ro/ (PERF.SS), where 1-u/ is assimilated
to the preceding /i -/ due to (Rule 13-19b).
Imperative forms are again irregular. When S0 sterns are followed by a 3rd person
singular S0 suffix /-u/ and the Imperative suffix 1-o/, 1-u/ is either regressively or
progressively assimilated; in the former case the glide w is inserted before -o-o (cf.

archiphonemes in the fourth row, i.e. /Q/, /HI and IN/, have a special status in
Motuna. They are the only consonants which can occupy the coda position in the
syllable. (Syllable structure of Motuna is (C 1)V(C2 ), where C 2 is one of the three
archiconsonants discussed here. cf. §2.4.1.) The first two archiphonemes, /Q/
and /HI, are characterised as a voiceless stop and a voiceless fricative, respectively,
without any oral gesture. 4 (Note that [h] before vowels, on the other hand, is a
back phoneme /h/.) The archinasal/N/ is a nasal without any specification of place
of articulation. It may be realised as one of the nasal phones [m], [n], [p] and [IJ]
before certain consonants or in word-final position (cf. §2.2.3).

"Verbal Morphology321The singular suffixes 1-moro/, 1-roro/ and /-woro/ are fused in various ways with the
following TAM suffixes. Those changes are summarised in §13.2.4.15.
I found three verbs which take the 2nd person suffix beginning with In/ instead of
/r/, i.e. /noro/- /nee-til- /nee-ru/. They are: /sih-/ 'to be quiet', /tung-/ 'to enter', and
/ruh-/ 'to come out' .13
The paradigm of the intransitive verb in middle voice /tum-/ 'to return', with all the
TAM suffixes listed in Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/femi'iJnine/dual-paucal gender suffixes in Table 13-3, is given below.","[349, 350]"

VerbsUnderlying forms of cross-referencing markings of four types of intransitive verbs,
given in Tables 13-5, 13-8, 13-10 and 13-12, are summarised in Table 13-13 in the
next page. See also Table 12-2a- c.
From Table 13-13 it may be summarised that:
( 1) 1st person is marked either by a nasal consonant (predominantly by /ml) or a vowel
/of.(2) 2nd person is predominantly marked either by /r/ (alternatively, /p/ or /hi), or a high
front vowel /if.
(3) 3rd person is predominantly marked by zero or the labial glide /w/ (alternatively, /p/
or /h/), or a back vowel /u/, or /wa/.
(4) Singular number is zero, dual number is marked by /-til, paucal/plural inclusive328Chapter 13number by /-ru/. Paucal/plural exclusive is marked by special forms.
(5) In addition, singular and nonsingular numbers are contrasted by the vowel /o/ and/eel in middle voice suffixes (except for the 1st person exclusive which is marked
by the vowel /a/).
The persons of free, reflexive and possessive pronouns (§5.2) are contrasted in
similar ways to the cross-referencing markings shown above. In general, the 1st
person of these pronouns is marked by the nasal /nl, the 2nd person by /r/, and the 3rd
person by /p/. Singular and nonsingular number (except for 1st person exclusive) are ''
indicated by the vowel /o/ and lee/, respectively, in most cases.'

VERBSTransitive verbs have the following basic morphological structure:
Diagram 13-14Basic Structure of Transitive Verbsgender
Stem- 0 person- A person- (dl/pcl) - (negative)- TAM - { ~~switch-referenceVerbal Morphology329As is shown above, the cross-referencing marking of transitive verbs consists of 0
and A person suffixes (which may also indicate paucallplural number and exclusiveness), and a dual or paucal/plural number suffix. The paradigm of 0 and A person/
number suffixes is given in Table 13-15a in page 330. The morphological structure of
the suffixes given in Table 13-15a is analysed in Table 13-15b in page 331. The
underlying forms of person and number suffixes are summarised in Tables 13-15c and
13-15d in page 332.
Note that A suffixes are identical with SA suffixes, and 0 suffixes with the initial
consonants of S0 suffixes. cf. Table 13-13. 14 Note also that inclusive/exclusive ·~
distinction exists only in paucallplural 0. 15 The initial /w/ of the 3rd person paucallplural A suffix /-wa/ is dropped after a consonant, as is mentioned in § 13.2.2, due to Rule
13-16b.
The only exception I have attested for Table 13-15 is the verb /kung-/ 'to bring/take
sb to one's place', which takes a 2nd person 0 suffix /-n/ instead of 1-r/. See similar
exceptions of middle voice suffixes in § 13.2.4.
Number suffixes are also identical with those used with intransitive verbs. In some
cases, however, the reduplication of an /rV/ string may indicate the nonsingularity of 0
and/or A. Such reduplication may be obligatory or optional. (Optional reduplication is
indicated by square brackets in Tables 13-15a and b.)
To sum up, the number of 0 and A is indicated as follows:
(1) If 0 is singular, a number suffix (/-til for dual and /-ru/ for pel), or the pel form ofA (in 1st and 3rd persons), reflects the number of A.
(2) If 0 is nonsingular and A is singular, a number suffix (/-til for dual and /-ru/ for
pel), or, if such a suffix does not exist, the pel form of A (in 1st person) 16 or 0 (in
1st person exclusive or 3rd person), reflects the number of 0.
(3) If 0 and A are nonsingular, a number suffix (/-til for dual and /-ru/ for pel), or, if
such a suffix does not exist, the pel form of A (in 1st person), reflects the number
of 0. In addition, the pel form of either A or 0, or a reduplication of an /ro/ string,
reflects the nonsingularity of A.
(4) The optional reduplication of an /rV/ string emphasises the plurality of all the
participants, which must include either a 1st person or 2nd person A.","[352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358]"
"76Chapter 1Motuna. Both ofthem are in their forties. They speak English and Tok Pisin fluently,
and apart from these languages, Dora speaks her father's language Roviana (Austronesian) in the Solomon Islands, and Therese her first husband's language Tinputz
(Austronesian) in Bougainville. They also speak neighbouring Non-Austronesian
languages such as Nagovisi and Buin to some extent.
There are other texts by two elderly speakers, Sirou Korikee (female) and Puuwa
Paurarai (male) from Haarii village, which were recorded by Therese when she was
herself collecting narratives and accounts of Siwai tradition from old people.
In all, my main corpus consists of twenty-three texts, in total duration of 138
minutes. As mentioned in § 1.2, there is very little dialectal variation among these
texts. The texts (I), (VIII) and (XVII) are given in Appendix for illustration. This
grammar is inductively formulated by examining the language data in these texts.
In addition, I use three texts of the Pouko dialect obtained from Agnes Kennedy (in
her thirties) for supplement. The reason why I did not use these texts in the same way
as the main texts mentioned above is that the Pouko dialect is quite distinct from other
dialects (cf. §1.2). The former are also characterised by many more loanwords and
incomplete sentences than the latter.
There are four more recorded
texts.
Two of them are recorded from the telephone
.
.
conversation of Therese with another Motuna speaker. One is a free conversation
between Therese and her three daughters. And the last one is a personal history told by
a male speaker, Alex Dawuia (in his forties), from Mamangota village. All these texts
are characterised by loanwords from English and Tok Pisin, and loose conversational
style with lots of incomplete sentences. Sentences and vocabulary (especially loanwords) found in these texts are occasionally used to illustrate particular aspects of the
grammar.
Four short conversational texts, and a collection of 166 short sentences, written by
Dora Leslie, are also used to illustrate some grammatical points.
All the examples cited from the above-mentioned data are identified at the end of
English translation in brackets. For example, (XI-13) indicates that it is taken from the
thirteenth sentence of the text (XI). If there is no number in brackets, the given
example is from elicitation. All the elicited examples were checked carefully by the two
main informants. Gaps in some areas of grammar --- especially in the paradigms of
nouns, classifiers and verbs --- are checked through elicitation. They were also
checked carefully by my two main informants.
The main aim of this grammar is to present major characteristics of this language for
language typologists and linguists in general. It is not exhaustive, but it covers all the
grammatical aspects found in the narrative texts mentioned above. I give examples
quite generously whenever I discuss important grammatical P?ints. Sometimes theIntroduction7same examples are used in different chapters. Wherever it is relevant, the use of the
same example in different chapters is referred to in the text or in brackets after the data
identification number.
Some aspects of the grammar --- such as the paradigms of numeral classifiers, the
use of the agentless passive construction --- are incomplete. These areas of grammar,
as well as detailed analysis of complex sentences and discourse organisation, investigation for sociolinguistic variation and genetic relationship with neighbouring languages,
are left for further research.","[34, 35, 36]"
"Introduction31.3 PREVIOUS WORK
The Roman Catholic and the Methodist missions started to work in the Siwai region
early in this century. Some of the missionaries studied Motuna and attempted to
translate biblical texts into Motuna. According to Allen and Hurd (1965), Rev. A. H.
Voyce, Fr. Schlieker and Pamela Beaumont translated some biblical texts and hymns.
Fr. Schlieker also worked on a elementary grammar, and Pamela Beaumont on a
dictionary. 3
l,Tn.,.dditi\JV\""lo the work done by the missionaries, American anthropologist Douglas
Oliver (1949, 1955) describes the Siwai life and culture with rich linguistic information
based on the data collected in his first field work in 1938-39. Although he is not a
professional linguist, his phonemic transcription is fairly accurate, and the linguistic
data he provides is invaluable.
Linguists belonging to the Summer Institute of Linguistics conducted field work on
the languages in Bougainville including Motuna. Among them, Allen and Hurd
( 1965), as mentioned above, did lexico-statical survey of all the languages in Bougainville including Motuna. Gasaway ( 1987) provides lexical data of the dialects of Motuna
and Nagovisi based on her field work. She also puts forward phonological analysis of
these data.","[31, 32]"

are drawn to show the segmentation. Each segment is alligned with its phonemic transcription given
underneath. (/roo/ 'you sg' in Figures 2-12 and 2-14- 2-16 are written as ""doo"" .)Phonology25rom0Figure 2-8ruu
Figure 2-926Chapter 2(2) In the case of words consisting of two moras, on the,other hand, the first mora
shows a phase of level or slightly rising high pitch immediately followed by a steep
drop in pitch, and the last mora shows either a continuous drop in pitch or a relatively
level low pitch. The F 0 extract of ramo 'back' in Figure 2-8 and that of ruu 'day' in
Figure 2-9 in page 25 show this.
In Figure 2-8, o of the initial ro shows a rising, and then a level phase in F 0 , which is
followed by the continuous falling in F 0 of mo. In Figure 2-9, the first half of the
utterance ruu shows a slight rising, and the second half shows a continuous falling in
F 0 which is slowed down at the end. 24
I will call the third mora from the last in the case of words consisting of three or
more moras (as the second a in arapah), and the first mora in the case of words consisting of two moras (as the first o in r6mo and the first u in rnu), ""stressed moras"",
provided that they are voiced.
As mentioned in §2.4, if the stressed mora happens to be an archinasal, the pitch of
the preceding vowel is generally maintained in it. Compare the F0 extract of ponnaa in
Figure 2-10 with that of hanna in Figure 2-11 in page 27. In Figure 2-10, the fall of
the F 0 of the nn of ponnaa is very gentle in the first half of the utterance, while in
Figure 2-11 that of the F0 of the nn of hanna is very steep especially in the first half of
the utterance. Stress falls on the first n in pofmaa, and on o in hanna.
/HI and /Q/ can not be stressed, because they are voiceless. Thus when the mora onwhich stress is usually assigned happens to be fW or /Q/, the stress automatically shifts
to the preceding vowel. That is, the pitch of the onset of the vowel before [h] or [?] is
much higher than the one of the following vowel.
In general, this stress pattern can determine the boundary of a phonological word.

The paradigm of the underlying forms of SA cross-referencing suffixes is given
below:

(3rd) --- are identical in form with, and undergo the same morphophonemic changes as,
A person suffixes in transitive verbs. Thus, in the morphophonemic analysis below,
they are simply called ""A suffixes"".
Note that the initial/w/ of the 3rd person paucallplural A suffix /-wal is dropped after
a consonant. See Rule 13-16b in §13.4.1. Nonsingular number may be expressed by
a person suffix (/-oN/ for 1st paucallplural and /-wal for 3rd paucallplural), or by an
additional number suffix /-til (dual) or 1-ru/ (paucallplural).
Inclusive/exclusive distinction does not exist in A cross-referencing suffixes. 9
The full paradigm of the SA verb /mon-/ 'to look', with all the TAM suffixes listed in
Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/feminine/dual-paucal gender
suffixes in Table 13-3, is discussed below. I will not make comments on the morphophonemic processes which have already been discussed in § 13.2.1. The realisation of
1st person A suffixes is highly irregular; it is summarised in §13.2.2.15.",[328]
"26Preview of Verbs273(2)' [uncontrollable process/event which affects oneself]The process or event expressed by the verb of this class is typically somatic. The
referent of S is animate, and undergoes the effects of the whole process/event which
he/she cannot control. Examples:
/turio-/ 'to become/be alarmed':

12-3""8/haring-/'to become/be worried'/nimautu-/'to look handsome (male)'lkaa-/'to be born'/k.inot-1'to become/be drowned'(3)' [complex activity in which one is involved]
The majority of stems in this subclass are derived from nouns which denote complex
activities. Original nouns include loan words from English or Tok Pisin such assikuulu(-) 'school(ing)/to be educated' and kiki- 'to play soccer' (cf. 12.4.3), and
nouns with the derivational suffix -ai such as tupur-ai 'burning off of the bush' andsiimp-ai 'sweeping' (cf. § 12.4.1 ).
The subject of the verb is involved in the described activity as an Agent, but there is
no specifiable Patient. Examples:

The conjunction roruki 'but, however' expresses that the sentence contrasts with theprevious sentence, or with something which is understood from the context. It may be
placed at the beginning of a clause (9-68b), or after the word which focuses on such
contrast (e.g. after the negator toku and the discourse marker nah-ah 'possibly' in
9-69b).",[243]

and was somewhere(= was not at home).' (XV-63, cf. 14-30a)
In 17-15, the dependent embedded clause tii haapi'-ku sets up the temporal framework
for the whole sentence. The perfect SS form pi-ro is controlled by tuujuu. The DS
marking of tuu-juu indicates that the state of the S referent of this verb 'our papa' is
contrasted with the main theme of the discourse, i.e. ""our (the narrator and her children) waiting at home"", which is understood from the context.

In 17-16, the overlapping referents of the twoS arguments, i.e. ""we two (the narratorand her daughter)"" of aat-opih and ""she (the narrator's daughter)"" of piruk-oro-mo, are
parts of the thematic framework of the whole discourse. Thus both of them are marked
by the SS suffixes.
The Continuous SS and DS forms, without explicit controlling clauses, are often
used to express the speaker's assertion that such states/durative events should continue

and relative clauses (§17.3), with examples from my corpus. Detailed study of
complex sentences, especially that of the discourse structure of clause chaining, is left
for further research.","[536, 537]"
