Interestingly, Yimas allows non-finite nominalizations rather like
agentive nominalizations to be formed for locationals. These are identi­
cal in form to other non-finite nominalizations except that they require
the concord marker - a IX SG and the oblique suffix. These describe a
place which exists specifically for the purpose of performing the action
described by the relative clause, as in these examples:
(7-106) a. awukcpau-t-a-n
bathe-NFN-IX SG-OBL
'bathing place'
b. wok-nanau-t-a-n
work-DUR-NFN-IX SG-OBL
'work place'
( nanav- DUR is used here in a typical way in modern Yimas:
by adding it to Tok Pisin words, new Yimas verb roots are
derived.)
c. mawrun

'place for killing enemies'
These finite relative clauses without m- NR DIST quite commonly
function alone without being linked as a modifier to any other noun in428INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSthe clause. This has led in some cases to their being re-analyzed as noun
stems.
(7-107) wa-n [amp-0-ra]
yara-k
go-IMP kindle-PERF-V PL pick up-IRR
'Go collect firewood!'
The main verb in this example is in the imperative mood, yet the tense of
the nominalization is perfective. These two are contradictory, of course,
the imperative corresponding to actions yet to be done, and the perfec­
tive to those already completed. This contradiction is possible simply
because nominalizations like ampra 'firewood' or amtra 'food' are now
nouns in their own right and are no longer seen as the result of a pro­
ductive nominalization process, rather like the dead in English.
The only relative clauses without m- NR DIST which commonly do
have an overt modified 'head' noun are those functioning like English
adjectives to express qualities or states. As pointed out in Sections 3.3
and 6.2.3.1.3, most Yimas roots corresponding to English adjectives are
actually verbs denoting processes, the so-called adjectival verbs. When
these translate English adjectives, i.e., denote states or qualities, they
are nothing but these m- less finite relative clauses, most commonly
found with the tense suffix -k IRR to describe an unbounded temporal
duration, although other tense suffixes are possible (7-108c).

A final point to consider here is the meaning contrast associated with
the presence versus absence of m- NR DIST in finite relative clauses. The
structural difference is represented in (7-99) versus (7-102b). To illus­
trate the contrast, consider (7-109a,b), diagrammed as (7-llOa,b):

Finite relative clauses with m- NR DIST are obligatorily associated with
a definite, established, modified 'head' noun as their referent, while those
without m- are not, often having a vague class of referents as possi­
ble referents (e.g., means of going (7-105d)). This is, of course, fully
in keeping with the presence versus absence of the definite near distal
stem. Further, a finite relative clause with m- often has established nom­
inal participants, reflected in the verbal pronominal affixes, while those
without m- never do. They obligatorily lack all expression of nominal
participants, either as independent words or pronominal affixes.
A common use of finite relative clauses with m- NR DIST is in cleft
constructions. These are equational sentences in which certain identify­
ing or descriptive features of a focused noun are provided by a relative
clause. The semantics of clefts thus prohibits them from occurring with
relative clauses without m- NR DIST. English examples are it was John
who shea·red the sheep and John was the one who sheared the sheep.
Yimas clefts consist of a noun ph1H a modifying relative clause plus an430INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSoptional copula. The relative clauses in both Yimas and English clefts
present information which is already known or presumed from the con­
text of the speech act. The function of a cleft construction is to use this
information to identify the proper referent of the noun of the cleft or
at least to predicate something important and relevant about it. Thus
the relative clause in both examples, who sheared sheep, provides rele­
vant information about the head noun of these cleft constructions, John.
Yimas clefts are exactly parallel.

Clefts are important in Yimas because they play a central role in
content questions, otherwise known as wh questions. Note that in ques­
tions like Who sheared the sheep? or What did he shear the sheep with?,
the action of shearing sheep is presupposed and established and what is
at issue is who did the action or what was used to perform it. Thus, the
pragmatic force of the non- wh component of these questions is identical
to that of a relative clause in a cleft, and so it is really no surprise that
some wh questions in Yimas take the forms of clefts. If the wh word
is functioning as S, then a cleft construction is obligatory; to use an
ordinary clause structure is ungrammatical.

ti- 'become, fell' is normally an intransitive verb, but in (5-71a) it has
two affixes, S and D; kra- 'cut' is a transitive verb, but in (5-71b) it has
three pronominal affixes, S, 0, and D. These D affixes mark fully core
arguments: whatever processes are available to D affixes on ditransitive
verbs are available to these as well, e.g., relativization, anaphoric control
over non-finite modifiers, etc. (see Chapter 7) . By assuming that the
pronominal affixes directly fill the core argument positions of the verb,
this is easily explicable. But otherwise it is not, for the nouns which
these affixes reference are only possessors of other core arguments, the
S in (5-71a) and the 0 in (5-71b). While these may be coded as core
arguments through the verbal prefixes, they may not appear as core
arguments in their own right:

These examples are ungrammatical because these possessors may
not be treated as core (i.e., lacking the oblique suffix) unless linked to
a pronominal affix. The contrast in grammaticality between (5-71) and
(5-72) clearly demonstrates that it is the pronominal affixes which confer
core status and, in fact, fill the argument slots of a verb.
Thus far, I have been discussing referents which are old or established
information and can therefore be indicated by a pronominal affix. What
about new information, characters or props now just being introduced
in the discourse? These can appear with or without a pronominal affix
so that in essence we have the three following structural patterns:
Pattern 1 :
Pattern 2 :
Pattern 3:0
NP
NPPRO-verb
PRO-verb
verbestablished referent
established/new referent
new referentwhere 0 means no overt noun phrase and PRO any pronominal affix.
Pattern 1 has already been illustrated and discussed elsewhere (exam­
ples (5-67a,b) and discussion thereof) , as has pattern 2 for established
referents (examples 5-65a,b) . In considering how new referents are intro-THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS233duced, let me consider the unambiguous case, pattern 3, first. Examples
of this follow:
(5-73) a. num-n-mat
Kampramanan wapal-k
village-OBL-PL hill name
climb-IRR
'The villagers climbed Kampramanan. '
paympan
b . m-n

'It, the eagle, saw those two.'
pu-nan-JJa-t
c. patn
betelnut V SG 3PL A-2SG D-give-PERF
'They gave you betelnut.'
(5-73a) has an intransitive verb, wapal- 'climb', with no pronominal
affixes; (5-73b) a transitive verb, tay- 'see', with only one pronominal
affix, that of the 0 argument; and ( 5-73c) a ditransitive verb, va- 'give',
with only two pronominal affixes, A and D. In each case, the missing
core argument is provided by an overt noun in the clause: numunmat
'villagers' in (5-72a) , paympan 'eagle' in (5-73b) , and patn 'betelnut' in
(5-73c). These examples all come from running texts in which these
nouns are just being introduced or re-introduced after a longish gap.
They are new information.
Given the earlier claim that the pronominal affixes fill the argument
positions of the verb, an important question is what is the relationship
to the verb of these nouns without coreferent agreement affixes? The
simple answer is just the same, but in this case they are linked to a
zero pronominal affix. In other words, Yimas has much in common
with the feature of uncontrolled 'pronoun drop' in East Asian languages
like Japanese, Thai, and Indonesian. To see how this analysis would
work, consider (5-73b) again. The transitive verb tay- 'see' has two core
arguments, A and 0 (I am here considering the notion of transitivity and
associated arguments to be a straightforward notion in Yimas. This
is not entirely the case, but it is best to postpone the discussion of
this until Section 6.2.1.). This transitive verb only has a single overt
agreement prefix, the prefix impa- 3DL 0, but, as it is a transitive verb,
it must have an A participant. Because of pragmatic reasons, i.e., the
referent of the A is a new participant, this is realized by a zero prefix.
A zero prefix is exactly that, one which has no specifications for class,
person and number and may therefore be linked to any noun which is
morphologically marked as core, i.e. , is not suffixed with the oblique
suffix -n """" - nan. Both noun phrases in (5-73b) meet this requirement,
m-n NR DIST III SG and paympan eagle III SG. But as they have the
Harne noun class and number specifications, they clearly have the same234BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYreferent, which is linked to the zero A prefix and interpreted with the A
role.
Example ( 5-73c) is similar, except that it contains a ditransitive verb
va- 'give' with overt agreement prefixes for A and D, but a zero prefix
for T. The clause contains a morphologically core noun patn 'betelnut'
which is linked to the verb through the zero T prefix and interpreted as
the theme.
Now consider example ( 5-73a) . This sentence contains an intransi­
tive verb, wapal 'climb', with no agreement prefixes and two associated
noun phrases. One of these, numnmat 'villagers', is morphologically a
core argument; the other, Kampramanan 'place name', is morphologi­
cally oblique, with the oblique suffix -n ""' - nan. Hence only numnmat
'villagers' may be linked to the zero S prefix on the verb and interpreted
in the S role.
This last example points up a very important constraint on the gram­
maticality of Yimas clauses which I will call the completeness constraint
(Foley and Van Valin 1984, 183) . It states that a noun may be realized
morphologically as a core argument (i.e., without the oblique suffix - n ""'
- nan) if and only if it is linked to a pronominal affix on the verb (which
may be zero). In other words, a noun without the oblique suffix must
be linked to a pronominal affix and a noun with it never can. The verb
wapal- 'climb' is a good one to illustrate this principle with. Although
basically intransitive, as in (5-73a) , it is actually ambitransitive like its
English equivalent. English climb is intransitive in the child climbed to
the top of the tree but formally transitive in the child climbed the tree.
Yimas behaves identically.

b. irpm
mu-n-wapal
coconut palm IV SG IV SG 0-3SG A-climb
'He climbed the coconut palm.'
(5-74a) contains wapal- 'climb' used intransitively with a single S prefix.
The noun irpm-un coconut palm IV SG-OBL is not a core argument and
therefore occurs with the oblique suffix. In (5-74b), the verb wapal is
used transitively and has both the A prefix n- 3SG A and the 0 prefix
mu- IV SG 0. Now irpm 'coconut palm' must be realized morpholog­
ically as a core argument and lack the oblique suffix. The use of the
oblique suffix in (5-74b) will result in ungrammaticality.

used to express new referents, let me return briefly to the case of pat­
tern 2 constructions (i.e. , NP PRO-verb), which may also express new
referents. It is important to remember that pattern 2 is potentially
ambiguous; it can also express established referents, as illustrated in
(5-65) . Pattern 2 , (noun phrase plus PRO-verb) commonly has a strong
contrastive component to its meaning. For example, it is generally used
in answer to an information question when the question word functions
as 0 or D.

who 2SG S-hit
'Who did you hit?'
b. A: .uaykum
pu-ka-tpul
woman II PL 3PL 0-lSG A-hit
'I hit the women'
Here, vaykum 'women' is the focus of the answer. This is indicated both
by an independent noun and the verbal agreement affix pu- 3PL 0.
In other cases, new referents are introduced through pattern 2 if they
are especially important new props in the development in the discourse
around which its progression turns, as in this example from a traditional
legend:
( 5-77) JlCt
mnta
ya-n-awa-ta-k-nakn
urine V PL and then V PL 0-3SG-excrete-put-IRR-3SG D
'And then she urinated on him.'
Although pet 'urine' is a new participant here, it is an important one,
because by noticing the urine, the man locates his daughter, and the
remaining plot of the story unfolds.
These examples are meant to give the reader a general feel for the
pragmatic, discourse-based differences which determine the choices of
pattern 1, 2 or 3. Because they are pragmatic and discourse-based, it is
impossible to write hard and fast, all-encompassing rules. Rather, there
are devices left open to the speaker to use creatively as he frames the
text. Some of the general principles involved I have discussed here, but
a more complete account will have to remain for a later more detailed
Htudy of Yimas discourse structures. The reader who is especially inter­
eHted is invited to study the texts at the end of this grammar and try
to work out some of these principles himself.
�.2 Tense, Aspect, and Mood
Yimas has a very rich system of tense, aspect, and mood distinctions.
Some aspectual distinctions are expressed through incorporated adver-BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY236bials and compounded verb stems and will be discussed in the relevant
sections in the next chapter (Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2). In this section, I
will only treat the aspect distinctions which are indicated in the suffixal
slots. Mood really corresponds to two separate inflectional categories in
Yimas: modality and illocutionary force. Modality is expressed through
a set of modal prefixes which occur verb-initially, before the pronomi­
nal prefixes, while illocutionary force distinctions such as imperatives or
hortatives are indicated by distinctive inflectional patterns with specific
pronominal affixes.
5.2.1 The Tense/ Aspect System
The only affixal position of a finite verb which is obligatorily occupied is
that of tense. This is a suffixal position following the verb stem(s) and
preceding the paucal and dative suffixes. If these latter are lacking, it
will occur in word final position.
(5-78) a. patn
na-kay-!Ja-ntuk-mpun
betelnut V SG V SG T-1PL A-give-RM PAST-3PL D
'We gave betelnut to them long ago.'
b. tan ipa-wa-ntut
there 1PL S-go-RM PAST
'We went there long ago. '
Note the alternation between the non-final form of the RM PAST tense
suffix, ntuk , and the final form, - ntut. This pattern of alternation be­
tween non-final and final forms is a common feature of the tense suffixes
in Yimas.
The tense/ aspect system of Yimas makes nine distinctions. The pri­
mary distinction is strictly not one of tense, but a modal one. But since
this is realized in the same suffixal slot as all the other tense distinctions,
it will be treated as part of the same paradigmatic system here. Thus,
the basic distinction in the Yimas tense/aspect system is between unreal
and real events. Unreal events are marked by the irrealis suffix -k ""' - T)k,
which indicates that the event so marked is outside the continuum of real
time, e.g. , in the legendary past or in the indefinite future (see Section
5.2.1.1). Real events must be marked by one of the other tense/aspect
suffixes. These express an eight way contrast. Yimas has two basic past
tenses: a near past, for events which occurred yesterday; and a remote
past, for events which occurred any time since the legendary past up
to about five days ago. In addition there is a far past, composed of
the remote past suffix plus the suffix -kia, discussed in Section 5.2.1.2,
which is used for events occurring from two days ago to five days ago,
although the boundary between this and the remote past is flexible, and
-TENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD237a switch from the remote past to the far past is often used for nuances
of vividness in narratives. The present tense is used to express events
which occurred today, but is divided according to aspectual contrasts.
There is a three-way aspectual contrast for present tense: perfective, for
events which are completed; imperfective, for events which are ongoing;
and habitual, for events which recur regularly according to the normal
expectations of life patterns in the community. Finally, there are two
future tenses: a remote future, for events which are fully expected to
occur the day after tomorrow or later; and a near future, for events
expected to occur tomorrow. The contrasts in the Yimas tense-aspect
system may be summarized in the following schema:
events
----- ---real
unreal
------ 1 ------present
past
future
--- I -----._
/ """"---- � ---RM PAST FR PAST NR PAST PERFIMPERF HABNR FUT RM FUT5.2.1.1 Irrealis
The irrealis suffix is used in Yimas to indicate events which are located
outside of the continuum of real time: they must be completely timeless,
in the legendary past or in the indefinite future. In other words, it marks
events whose temporal coordinates cannot clearly be fixed by the speaker
in what he regards as experiential time. Because the irrealis occurs at
both ends of the temporal continuum, it may be conjectured that Yimas
speakers view time not as an open infinitely expandable line, but as a
closed circle.
UNREAL TIME
IRR
PRESENT
REAL TIME
This is a tempting speculation, but there is no evidence at present, other
t han the distribution of the irrealis suffix to affirm or deny it.
The use of the irrealis to express timeless events is prototypically
indicated by its use with the copula. If the reader will glance back at
the forms of the copula in Section 5.1.5, he will note that all forms
l.!�rminate in the irrealis -k. The copula is used in statements which hold238BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYtrue generally and are not bound to particular periods of time. In fact
the use of any other tense/aspect/mood inflection with the copula is
ungrammatical.
The irrealis suffix is probably most commonly found in traditional
legends, where it is almost invariably used, although the remote past
would also be an option. Consider the following:
(5-79) a. tan impa-ampu-mpi-awl-k
there 3DL S-float-SEQ-take-IRR
'They both drifted there.'
b. impa-mpu-yakal-irm-tay-Jlcut
3DL 0-3PL A-CONT-stand-see-RM PAST
'They stood watching them both.'
These two examples come from the same text and are separated only by
a single sentence. Both take place in exactly the same time period, the
legendary past, yet one is marked with the irrealis and the other with
the remote past suffix. In terms of absolute time reference, there is no
difference in this text between the irrealis and the remote past. But the
use of the remote past implies that events occurred in the stream of real,
albeit remote, time, while the irrealis removes them from the continuum
of real time altogether and situates them in the period before real time
as apprehended by men began. The use of the remote past in such
traditional legends is actually rather less common. In the text from
which the sentences in (5-79) were drawn, that of the creation myth,
less than 20% of all sentences in the legendary past are inflected with
the remote past suffix, the rest occur with the irrealis. Quite commonly,
a speaker will start a legend with the remote past suffix, but by the
third or fourth sentence will switch to the irrealis and remain with that
through the rest of the text. Also, it is sometimes the case that a speaker
will switch from the irrealis to the remote past in the denouement of a
text: this provides a vivid or immediate coloring to the events described.
The irrealis may also mark as yet unrealized future events. In this
case, it contrasts with the remote future tense. Consider these examples:
(5-80) a. ama patn
wayk-k
lSG betelnut V SG buy-IRR
'I want to/will buy betelnut.'
b. patn
na-ka-wayk-kt
betelnut V SG V SG 0-lSG A-buy-RM FUT
'I will buy betelnut after tomorrow.'
The remote future suffix -kt , as in (5-80b) , commits the speaker to the
belief that the event described will definitely or at least is highly likely
to occur in the future. The irrealis suffix requires no such commitment.","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]"

'He has money, and he will go. '
I n both examples o f (5-137), the first clause sets up the condition of
having money, and the second predicates the act of going in relation
to that condition. The potential prefix has the unmarked reading of a
possible event, but one which in the normal course of events will not
occur. Hence the presence of the negative in the English translation of
(5-136a) , not present in the original. The potential prefix ant- breaks
the expectation of the normal relation between the two clauses. Note
the conjunction kanta 'but' which informants required here. The likely
prefix has none of these negative expectations; it simply indicates that
the event of the second clause is a probable event, given the conditions
of the first clause.
Perhaps the most common usage of the likely modal prefix is to form
a kind of indirect imperative, an injunction. This construction combines
ka- LIKE with the imperative/hortative suffix - n """" - na (see Section
5.2.3.1) to mean 'let Y do Y'. X must be a third person participant.

5.2.3 Mood
Mood is the verbal category which expresses the speech act value of an
utterance, i.e., whether it is a statement, question, command, exhorta­
tion, wish, etc. The most common mood categories in Yimas, declar­
ative and interrogative, are not morphologically marked. Statements,
utterances in declarative mood, are indicated by a sharp final fall in in­
tonation, while questions, the interrogative mood, have a corresponding
rise.","[283, 284]"
"1J46/i/[i] / everywherePHONOLOGY[khaugi]
'shells'
[irak]
'dance'
Yimas has only two diphthongs, /ay/ and /aw/. Both have a strong
tendency to be raised, i.e., realized phonetically as /ey/ and /ow/. In
addition, jaw/ is commonly monophthongized to [:->], thus merging jaw/
with /a/ for one of its allophones. Some speakers actually make a min­
imal pair between pay 'be in fiat, reclining position' and pey '(human
being) sleep'. This latter verb may never be realized as [phay]; but since
it is clearly a semantic specialization of one of the phonetic realizations
of pay 'be in a fiat, reclining position', it seems unnecessary to propose a
distinct phonemic diphthong for this one example. Yimas lacks all other
diphthongs; there are no /iw/, /uy/, and most importantly, no /iw/ or
fiyj. When /i/ comes in contact with /w/ or fy/ through morphological
processes, it becomes /u/ or /i/ respectively ( anti- 'hear' + - wat HAB >
ant:J!!wat 'usually hear' and kampi- LIKE 3DL + yan 'come' > kampjyan
'let them both come'). This suggests that the high vowels do not have
the same status in the phonology as the low vowel /a/.
The problematic status of /i/ among Sepik area languages has been
well documented (see Laycock 1965, Pawley 1966, Foley 1986), and
Yimas is no exception. The problem arises because of the epenthetic
function of i to break up impermissible consonant clusters, as in these
examples:
am- 'eat'
+ - n IMP > amjn 'eat'

This is a pervasive feature of Yimas; any extensive sample of Yimas text
will present hundreds of examples of epenthetic i. (Vowels not enclosed
in slashes indicate contrastive, taxonomic phonemes, not underlying,
systematic ones.) However, not all examples of i can be analyzed away
as epenthetic. There are a few clear examples of /i/ separating two
consonants which would form a permissible consonant cluster and so
must be analyzed as underlyingly present,
patn
'betelnut' versus amanatin 'I feel'
kankan- 'shooting'
versus ninikiniv 'chin'
The problem can be stated summarily as follows: How do we know
when a /i/ is really there and not epenthetic? Unfortunately, there is no
straightforward answer to this question and I will adopt the following
conventions in this analysis:
--+kavki
irakVOWELS47Any i which alternates with 0 will be treated as epenthetic:
'stick' SG: yaniv PL: yanki underlying form: lyanul
'bone' SG: tanim PL: tanpat underlying form: ltanml
2. Any i which occurs in an otherwise impermissible cluster will be
treated as epenthetic. All others are underlying:
'chin' ninikiniv underlying form: lnnikinul
'nose' tikay underlying form: ltkayI
Epenthetic i is inserted according to convention 2 from left to right.
Consider lmkrayul 'cane'. lmkl is a prohibited initial cluster, so
li/ is inserted, while lkrI is a permissible medial cluster resulting
in mikray'T).
3. If an i phoneme is not established as underlying by conventions 1
and 2, it will be treated as epenthetic. This will result, in many
cases, in vowelless words, roots and affixes.
Consider tikit 'chair'. Both tokens of i in this word should be con­
sidered as epenthetic, because both break up impermissible clusters.
Treating both as such then results in the vowelless root ltktl. i inser­
tion applies twice from left to right, first to break up the impermissible
initial cluster ltkl, and then again to the impermissible final cluster
lktl.
Now consider the more complex underlying form ltukntkl 'blacken'.
Again, i-insertion will apply from left to right. ltul is not an accept­
able initial cluster by the phonotactic statement of Section 2.1 .2, so i
insertion will apply to form ti'T). The next cluster lukl is a permissible
medial cluster but * luknl is not, so i insertion must apply. The prob­
lem is to decide exactly where it will apply, and for this the principles of
syllabification given at the end of Section 2 . 1 .2 are crucial. Remember
that for clusters of two consonants the syllable boundary falls between
them (VC1 .C2V) , so that for lukl we have lu.kl (i.e., lui belongs to
the previous syllable). A basic constraint on the operation of the i inser­
tion rule is that it may not apply at a syllable break, because its whole
function is to create syllable peaks where there are none. By default, i
would appear between lkl and lnl. Note, however, that lnl now falls
between two stops lkl and ltl, one of which is homorganic. This is the
environment for syllabic nasals, as discussed in 2 . 1 . 1, and lnl will be
realized syllabically, although alternatively, an epenthetic i may occur in
this environment because, like nasal syllabification, i-insertion functions
to provide lacking syllabic peaks. In fact, I view the nasal syllabifica­
tion rule in these environments as nothing but a phonetic variant of the
i insertion rule. Finally, ltkl is not a permissible final cluster, result1.","[61, 62, 63]"
"TENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD253The same negative number suffixes again reference the number of the
S argument, but the third person forms contrast with the first person
forms in ( 5-98) in that all distinctions in number in the pronominal
prefixes are lost. All four numbers in the third person are expressed
by the same prefix pu-, the normal S/0 pronominal prefix for third
plural. Note further that whereas the negative forms for intransitive
verbs with first person S arguments reveal an underlying nominative­
accusative role-marking schema in that the S argument is realized by
the A prefix form, third person arguments continue to show an ergative­
absolutive alignment in both positive and negative forms. Thus, all third
person S arguments regardless of number are expressed in negated verbs
by the pronominal prefix pu- 3 PL S/0, the actual number being carried
by the negative number suffixes. I will again take up this question of
the accusative versus ergative split in negative verbs when discussing
transitive verbs below.
Second person S arguments show an interesting feature as a result
of the inflectional patterns of the positive verbs. Remember that the
pronominal prefix n- is homophonous for 2/3SG A, but that the other
numbers in second person show no similarity with third person. This
overlap is also exhibited in the negative verbs. Negative verbs with
second singular S arguments have pu- (typical of third person), and the
pronominal prefix n-, the normal form for second singular A, used in
this case for an S argument (demonstrating again the usual nominative­
accusative pattern for first and second person arguments) . Consider the
following examples:
(5-100) a. ta-pu-n-wa-t
NEG-3-2SG S-go-PERF
'You didn't go. '
b. ta-nan-wa-r-um
NEG-2PL S-go-PERF-PL
'You all didn't go. '
Thus, although in positive verbs n - 2/3SG A is homophonous, the dif­
ference in negative verbs in morphological behavior of first and second
person S arguments, on the one hand, and third person, on the other,
ensures that the negative forms for verbs with second and third singular
S arguments are distinct; compare (5-lOOa) with (5-99a(ii)) .
S o far I have only considered intransitive verbs with human, pronom­
inal S arguments. An inanimate noun, of course, can also function as
an S argument, but in this case, instead of one of the negative number
suffixes above, the possessive/adjective concord marker corresponding
to the class and number of the inanimate noun is used to reference it.","[268, 269]"

3.7 Pronouns
Yimas has a very rich inventory of pronominal forms, but most of these
are bound morphemes and will be discussed in the relevant sections of
the morphology. I will only be concerned here with pronouns which
are free independent words. True pronouns in Yimas only belong to
the first- and second-persons, i.e., refer to the speaker and addressee.
The so-called third-person pronouns refer to participants absent, or not
directly interacting in the immediate, ongoing speech act, and belong
to the word class of deictics in Yimas, to be treated in the following
section.
Besides two persons, Yimas distinguishes four numbers in its pro­
nouns: singular, dual, paucal (a few: from three up to about seven,
but variable depending on context) , and plural. The basic independent
pronouns are
DL
PC
PL
SG
1 ama
kapa
paukt
ipa
2 mi
kapwa
paukt
ipwa
I t. should be noted that for the non-singulars, the second-person formsderived from the first by an infix -w- (this goes back to Proto-Lower
S1�pik; see Foley 1986, 220-1). In fact, in the paucal there is no difference
whatsoever; the two forms are homophonous, the distinction being made
hy cross-referencing verbal person/number prefixes.
Compared to English, these pronouns are used relatively infrequently,
t.lwir basic categories being normally expressed by prefixes to the verb
(Hm� Section 5.1). The free pronouns can be used in combination withare112WORD CLASSESthe verbal prefixes, but then the pragmatic effect is generally contrastive,
i.e., ' it 's me (not you or anyone else) who . . . ' (see Section 5.1.6).
3.8 Deictics
As with many languages, deictics are a rather elaborated part of Yi­
mas grammar. The basic function of a deictic is to locate the position
of an object in space (or in some languages, in time (Becker 1974))
with respect to the positions of the participants in the speech act. The
basic participants in a speech act are the speaker, the addressee, and
the person spoken about (absent from the immediate speech act, but
nonetheless one of its topics). Yimas has a deictic stem corresponding
to each of these three positions. There is a deictic stem -k 'this (near
me)' to refer to things close to the speaker, a stem m- 'that (near you)'
for those close to the addressee and a stem - n 'that yonder (near neither
you nor me) '. All deictics agree in number and noun class with the noun
denoting the objects whose location they are specifying. The proximal
deictic -k and the far distal deictic - n take the set of verb prefixes, while
the near distal deictic m- takes the adjectival suffixes. So for class VII
we would have the following set of nine forms:
-n FR DIST
-k PROX
m- NR DIST
SG
m-n
p-k
p-n
pla-n
pla-k
mpl
DL
PL
pia-n
pia-k
m-rampl 'those two' is a contraction from m- the near distal stem plus - mpl
the adjectival class VII dual suffix.
These deictic forms can be used as modifiers of head nouns (like
adjectives) or as noun phrases in their own right (like pronouns). When
used like adjectives they most commonly occur after the head noun,
as in imp ram pk 'this basket', but this is by no means obligatory, and
the opposite order is also found, pk impram. The former are sometimes
elliptical versions of predicative uses of the deictics with the usual copula
deleted. So we would have examples like the following
(3-30) impram
p-k
papk
basket VII SG VII SG-PROX COP VII SG
'This is a basket.'
The copula in Yimas is a highly complex verb form with many irregu­
larities (see Section 5.1.5) . It agrees for person, number, and class with
the noun it predicates (in the above example, class VII SG) . The forms
of the copula with different person, number, and class combinations are
presented in Section 5.1.5. In the singular (and only for some classes)
the copula makes an additional distinction usually associated with de-DEICTICS113ictics in a number of languages. In these classes, there are two forms in
the singular for the copula, one used for objects which are visible and
one for things invisible.
aykk
(3-31) a. anti
ground VIII SG COP VIII SG VIS
'It's ground (seen) .'
b. anti
ayk
ground VIII SG COP VIII SG INVIS
'It's ground (unseen) . '
(3-32) a . awruk
ku-k
kawk
bandicoot X SG X SG-PROX COP X SG VIS
'This is a bandicoot (seen) . '
b. awruk
akuk
bandicoot X SG COP X SG INVIS
'It's a bandicoot (unseen).'
The (a) examples above use the visible copula forms and identify ob­
jects seen by the speaker. These are largely identificational uses of the
copula, rather than predicational: the (a) examples would be uttered in
a context when the speaker is holding up a bandicoot or a lump of dirt
and identifying what it is. The (b) examples are used when describing
objects unseen by the speaker and largely correspond to predicational
uses of the copula. For example, (3-32b) would be uttered if on walking
through the bush one heard a rustling sound in the grass, while (331b) would be said if on swimming through the lakes one stood up and
touched bottom. (3-30), with a visible copula form, also corresponds to
a predicational usage and would be a likely answer to a question like
'what are you making?', asked while watching someone weaving. As the
object being woven is visible to both parties in this context, this demon­
�·ltrates that the semantic contrast of visible versus invisible is more basic
than that between identificational and predicational uses. In most cases
the two meanings coincide, so it is in fact difficult to extricate them.
AH mentioned above, the visible/invisible contrast is only found in the
singular and only with some classes; for further discussion of the uses of
the copula and a complete listing of all forms, see Section 5.1.5.
These deictics also function in Yimas as the third-person pronouns.
The unmarked form in this usage is the near distal deictic. In ongoing
narrative discourse, it is this set of forms which are most commonly
used as free pronouns. But in direct quotes in and in normal everyday
('onversational discourse, all three basic forms are employed with the
following meanings. Forms based on the proximal deictic stem -k are
used to refer to participants or objects within the immediate contextWORD CLASSES1 14of the speech act. So in talking about a child sitting next to the two
interlocutors, one would use the form na-k, the proximal form for class
I and II singular, the classes for human beings. The choice between the
near distal and the far distal stems is more subtle. If one wishes to
emphasize the position of the participant or object as being near the
addressee, one could use the near distal stem. Similarly, if one wishes to
emphasize its distance from both major participants, one could use the
far distal form. But both of these reasons for their use would be unusual
and would result in a quite emphatic reading on the deictic, i.e., 'that
thing right here near you' or 'that thing which is certainly far away, not
near you or me'. More commonly, the choice of the near or far distal
deictic stem reflects the centrality of the participant in the discourse or
the speaker's empathy toward it. So, for example, one would talk about
a child using m-n, the near distal form for classes I and II singular, if
he was a central participant in the discourse or we felt good feelings
toward him. The far distal form na-n, on the other hand, is likely to be
used if we are angry at the child or if he is of only passing, secondary
interest.
Corresponding to each of the deictic stems is deictic adverb of place.
These are formed from the same stems plus an affix.
ta-k
m-nti
ta-n'here (near me)'
'there (near you)'
'there (near neither me nor you)'Again the stems -k and -n occur with a prefix in this case ta-, while
m has a suffix - nti. These forms are closely related to the interrogative
deictic, meaning 'where'. Yimas has a stem vka, meaning 'where?',
to which is added the same set of prefixes found on the deictic stems
-k and -n. The basic form is ta-vka 'where', which is used when the
location of an action is queried or when the speaker wishes to be vague
about the object whose location is requested. In all other cases in which
the location of a known object is being sought, the stem -vka must be
prefixed with the proper verbal prefix for the class of the object. Quite
clearly, in Yimas the word 'where?' is a verb. Consider the following
question in (a) with its answer in (b) , employing the class VII singular
noun impram 'basket'.
(3-33) a. impram
p-uka?
basket VII SG VII-where
'Where is the basket?'
tampaymp-n
b. impram
basket VII SG hook VII SG-OBLDEICTICS115p-na-apca-mpi-irm-n
VII SG 8-DEF-hang-SEQ-stand-PRES
'The basket is hanging on the hook. '
In the interrogative (a) sentence, the - vka 'where?' functions as the main
verb, taking the normal verbal prefix for its nominal argument. -vka is
a rather defective verb. It cannot be inflected for any typically verbal
categories like tense, mood, or aspect, nor can it mark the number of its
nominal argument by the prefix; it can mark only class.
Other interrogative words in Yimas are:
(who-SG)
'who (SG)'
naw-n
'who (DL)'
naw-rm
(who-DL)
(who-PC)
' who (PC)'
naw-ukt
(who-PL)

naw-m
wa-ra
(what-PL)
'what, something'
wara pucmp-n (what time VII SG-OBL) 'when'
wara-t-nti
(what-NFN-action)
'why/how'
wara-wal
'how'
(what-manner)
(what-talk)
'what talk'
wara-mpwi
'what want'
wara-wampu1J (what-heart)
(what-NFN-SG)
'what kind'
wara-t-awt
(how many-act)
ntuk-nti
'how much, how many'
ntuk-mpat
(how many-VII PL)
'when'
As can be clearly seen many of these interrogative words are based on
the stem wara 'what' plus suffixes of nominalizations and complements.
This suggests that like -vka 'where' , wara also has verbal characteristics.
Another set of words to be considered in this section are adverbs of
manner derived from the deictics of place. These are formed by adding
the adverbial suffix - mpi to the proximal and near distal adverbs:
tak 'here' + -mpi > takmpi 'like this'
mnti 'there' + -mpi > mntmpi 'like that'
Interestingly, this suffix can be added to the word tavka 'where?' to
form a derived verb (further demonstrating its status as a verb), as in
the following example:
(3-34) tauka-mpi ya-n-ntak-t
mnta
where-ADV V PL 0-2SG A-leave-PERF then
ma-ya-t
2SG S-come-PERF
'You left (things) where and now you came?'
Here the things left behind are left unspecified, cross-referenced by the
vague, unmarked plural prefix ya- (probably understood as referring to1 16WORD CLASSESthe noun maramara 'things, possessions') . There is no real semantic con­
trast between this sentence and one with the underived tavka, although
the tavkampi form is more likely to be used with action verbs ( espe­
cially motion verbs) and tavka with stative or position verbs. Perhaps
a more accurate translation, then, of tavkampi would be 'in a where-ing
manner? '.
Finally, there are two stems, which on morphological and to a certain
extent semantic grounds, seem best assigned to the deictic word class.
These are kawvkwan- 'something like _' and mntn- 'this sort of _'.
Like the near distal deictic stem m-, these take the adjectival concord
suffixes indicating the class and number of their modified noun.
(3-35) a. anti
kawJJkwan-i
land VIII SG something like-VIII SG
'something like land.'
mntn-put
b. JJaykum
woman II PL this sort-II PL
'these sorts of women.'
mntn-ra
c. yara
tree V PL this sort-V PL
'these sorts of trees. '
3 . 9 Conjunctions
Yimas has only three conjunctions tay 'and then', mnta 'and then' and
kanta 'but'. The second two are obviously built on a stem - nta, to which
is added the near distal deictic stem m- or a negative prefix ka-. Both
of these are coordinating conjunctions. Yimas lacks a disjunctive coor­
dinating conjunction, i.e., 'or' , and all subordinating conjunctions. The
meanings of the latter are expressed through bound affixes to verbs,
sometimes in combination with temporal stems. The conjunction tay
normally introduces a new sentence, but may function to conjoin clauses
within a single sentence. The other two conjunctions kanta and mnta
normally occur after the first element of the second clause they are con­
joining, rather than between the two clauses (as do their English equiv­
alents), although that position is also possible. Consider this example:mnta
(3-36) i-kay-api-wat
kajlut
VIII SG 0-lPL A-put in-HAB black palm X PL then
ura-kay-mampi-api-wat
X PL 0-lPL A-again-put in-HAB
'We put in (the floor supports) and again we put in the
(pieces of) black palm.'","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"

NEG-3-2SG 0-hit
'He didn't hit you.'
(ii) ta-pu-nan-tpul-c-ak
NEG-3-2PL A-hit-PERF-SG
'You all didn't hit him.'
The pronominal prefix nan- is homophonous for 2SG 0 and 2PL A. The
contrast between these forms is provided by the difference in the behavior
of the third singular participant: the third singular A is realized as 0,
but the third singular 0 as - nak.
d. (i) ta-pu-nan-tpul-c-rm
NEG-3-2SG 0-hit-PERF-DL
'Those two didn't hit you. '
(ii) ta-pu-nan-tpul-c-rm
NEG-3-2PL A-hit-PERF-DL
'You all didn't hit those two.'
The examples in (d) must remain ambiguous: the number of lower
ranked third person dual participant must be indicated by the dual num­
ber suffix -rm regardless of whether it is A (5-106d, i) or 0 (5-106d, ii) .
These examples of transitive verbs again bring up the question of the
accusative-ergative split according to person. If we compare intransitive
and transitive negative verbs having first and second person participants,
we find that the S argument is indicated by the same prefix form as the
A argument, a clear nominative-accusative participant role alignment.","[271, 272]"
"INTERJECTIONS117Note that mnta occurs following kaput 'black palm', the object of the
second clause it is conjoining. If, as in most cases, the two clauses just
consist of verbs, mnta will occur between them:
(3-37) ya-n-kaprak-t
mnta ya-n-am-t
V PL 0-3SG A-cut up-PERF then V PL 0-3SG A-eat-PERF
'He cut (the food) up and then ate it.'
Clause boundaries are sometimes difficult to determine with these
conjunctions. If a nominal is shared by the two conjoined clauses, the
conjunctions will often follow it, especially if it is oblique.

For more discussion of the grammar of conjunctions, see Section
7.3.2.
3.10 Interjections
Interjections are a small class of uninflected words used to express emo­
tional states or reactions, yes or no, or greetings. The following are
interjections in Yimas:
yaw
'yes'
kayak
'no'
ay
'wow, really, heh, what!'
aw
'hello, farewell' (social greeting)
apa
'OK'
Interjections typically form an utterance by themselves, constituting a
separate intonation group.","[132, 133]"

'They cut my hair.'
The verbs ant- 'hear' and kra- 'cut' are bivalent, yet the constructions in
which they occur are ditransitive, with three core arguments: A, T, and
D participants. Note that in neither of these cases is there any valence
increasing morphology which would license the extra core argument, al­
though, as we shall see below, there are semantic conditions on when
this is permitted (see Section 6.2.3.2). In any case, examples like those
of (6-10) and, to a lesser extent, those in (6-9) demonstrate that the re­
lationship between the valence of a verb and its transitivity is somewhat
fluid in Yimas.
It is important to note further than the transitivity of a verb is
properly a feature of the verb theme. Most commonly, the transitivity
of the theme is equivalent simply to the valence of the verb stem with
the highest valence index.

'They hit and cut his skin.'
In (6-lla), one verb root kamal- 'search' is bivalent while the other,
kula- 'walk', is monovalent. The bivalent verb root licenses the whole
verb theme to be inflected as transitive. (6- l lb) again has two verb
roots, the bivalent wul- 'boil' and the trivalent va- 'give'. In this case
the verb theme is ditransitive because of the trivalent verb root. Finally,
(6-llc) contains two bivalent verb roots, tpul- 'hit' and kamprak- 'break
open', yet the verb theme is formally a ditransitive verb, with three core
arguments: A, T, and D. This possibility is sanctioned by the same
principles that generated the examples in (6-10) (see the discussion of
possessor-raising in Section 6.2.3.2), but note again that the three core284THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREarguments are a feature of the entire verb theme, not the individual verb
roots.
6.2.2 Verb Stem Derivations: Reciprocal Formation and Valence
Decreasing
Yimas has very little in the way of grammatical processes which decrease
the valence of a verb. There is in fact only one productive grammatical
process which may be viewed as resulting in the reduction of a verb's
valence: namely, reciprocal formation. Verbs which are marked with the
reciprocal affix are used to express actions in which two or more actors
do the same action to each other, e.g., marry (each other) , fight (hit
each other), or converse (talk to each other) . In Yimas, reciprocal verbs
are marked by the prefix ti- which bears a transparent formal similarity
to the verb root ti- 'do, feel, become' and may, in fact, be diachronically
related to it. The prefix ti- RCP always occurs with verb roots which
are minimally bivalent.(6-12) a. m-mpi-t-ayk-kr-mp-n

The four verb roots i n (6-12a-d) are bivalent, yet they may only occur
with a single pronominal affix, i.e., they must be formally intransitive.
It is in fact, ungrammatical to have two pronominal prefixes, in combi­
nation with ti-, as (6-13) demonstrates (compare with (6-12b) ) .

The missing pronominal affix is that which would express the dative. In
the remarks below, for simplicity of exposition I will confine myself to
bivalent verb roots, but the same claims apply as well to trivalent verbs;
simply alter all the descriptive terms used below for bivalent verb roots
to those applicable to trivalent verbs.
While clearly formally intransitive in allowing only one pronomi­
nal prefix, reciprocal verbs present a potential problem with respect to
the formal status of ti- RCP: does this prefix simply stand in place
of a core pronominal prefix, so that the verb stem still actually pos­
sesses two core argument slots, or does it truly reduce the valence of
the verb, making it monovalent, associated only with a single core ar­
gument? The way to decide this question, of course, revolves around
the role marked by the single pronominal prefix. If it is A or 0, this
argues that the verb is actually bivalent with only one core argument
realized by the pronominal prefix and the other by the prefix ti- RCP .
If the prefix is the S form, then this supports the claim that the verb
is monovalent and occurs with a single core argument, indicated by the
S prefix. Unfortunately, the examples above with third person partic­
ipants are of no help in deciding this question, because as we saw in
Chapter 5, the form of third person pronominal prefixes is often deter­
mined by linear order, and this relationship disguises their role marking.
Rather, we need to consider examples in another person, such as in the
following:
( 6-14 ) a. ipa-ti-tpul
1PL S RCP hit
'We hit each other.'
b. ipa-nanau-ti-kankantakat-]lcut
1PL S-DUR-RCP-ask-RM PAST
'We were asking each other.'
These examples argue for the second of our two alternatives, i.e., that
ti- actually reduces the valence of the verb, deriving a monovalent verb
stem from a bivalent verb root. In ( 6-14 ) the pronominal prefixes are
the S forms. As this is the only permissible pronominal prefix, these
verbs must be formally intransitive and hence monovalent, with a single
core argument. Examples like those in ( 6-14 ) with reciprocalization of
bivalent verbs, fail to provide evidence as to whether the A or the 0 is
actually lost in the process of reciprocal formation, for there is only a
single S prefix in the derived verb form. Trivalent verbs do provide such
crucial evidence.

Note that the A prefix form is found in the reciprocal derivative of a
trivalent verb, and that the use of the D prefix results in an ungram­
matical sentence. This indicates that it is the non-A participant which
is suppressed in a reciprocal verb derivation. Looked at in another
way, it is the non-A argument which is bound by the A, and not vice
versa.
There is still another piece of evidence supporting the analysis of
ti- RCP as a valence decreaser. Yimas has a productive system of non­
finite nominalization (see Section 7.1), and for these constructions, ver­
bal pronominal affixes are entirely prohibited. But these nominalizations
can be formed with a verb prefixed by ti- RCP.

'There was talking among them in the vernacular.'
If ti- is analyzed as an pronominal prefix indicating coreference with a
preceding prefix, examples like (6-16), in which there is no other per­
missible pronominal prefix, become hard to explain. On the other hand,
if ti- RCP is simply a valence decreasing prefix, deriving a bivalent verb
stem from the trivalent verb root i- 'tell', then ( 6-16) is unproblematical.
It is common cross-linguistically for reflexive constructions, in which
a participant acts upon himself, to be formed in a very similar way to
reciprocal constructions, in which two or more participants act upon
each other. Yimas departs from this tendency, however, for reflexive
and reciprocal constructions in this language actually have little in com­
mon. Yimas lacks any coherent way of forming reflexive constructions;
a number of seemingly ad hoc devices express this notion. For example,
a semantically reflexive verb may be monovalent, as with body action
verbs like 'bathe' or 'shave' (as in English),
(6-17) a. na-na-awukcpa-n
3SG S-DEF-bathe-PRES
'He is bathing (himself) .'
b. ama-na-wantk-n
1SG S-DEF-dress up-PRES
'I'm getting dressed up.'
or a normally bivalent verb may be used intransitively, with no overt
valence altering morpheme (again, as in English) .","[298, 299, 300, 301, 302]"

When we come to transitive and ditransitive verbs with both a first
and second person participant, the use of the paucal suffix becomes more
complex, because it is now potentially (albeit, in practice, almost never)
ambiguous as to what participant it is linked to. To grasp clearly the
basic system let me first present examples which are not potentially am­
biguous, involving a paucal and a dual or singular participant. Following
the pattern of exposition established for transitive and ditransitive verbs
above, ·let us begin with the case of a second person A and a first person
0. Consider the case in which the second person A is paucal:222BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY(5-50) a. pa-J]a-tput-c-J]kt
2PC-1SG 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit me.'
b. pa-J]kra-tput-c-J]kt
2PC-1DL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit us two.'
Because the first person 0 is the higher ranked prefix, it occurs in the
inner position. The second person paucal A is realized by the prefix pav­
(appearing as pa- before an /JJ/), presumably a contraction from the S
form, pavkra-. Although unnecessary because the prefix pav- uniquely
marks paucals, the suffix - vkt is also used. This second person prefix
pav- only occurs in combination with first person participants, never
third person.
Now consider the opposite case, with a singular or dual second person
A and a paucal first person 0 .
(5-51) a . ma-kra-tpul-c-J]kt
2SG A-lPL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You hit us few.'
b. kapwa-kra-tupul-c-J]kt
2DL A-lPL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You two hit us few. '
Here the suffix -vkt is necessary t o distinguish these forms from the
corresponding verbs with plural 0, for there is no unique first person
paucal prefix parallel to pav-. As with transitive verbs generally, the S
forms are used to mark the second person A in both examples (compare
(5-27)) .
Switching the assignment of participant roles to a first person A and
a second person 0 and considering the case of a paucal second person
first, I present the following:
(5-52) a. paJ]-kul-cpul-c-J]kt
2PC-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'I hit you few. '
b . kapa paJ]-kul-cpul-c-J]kt
lDL 2PC-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'We two hit you few.'
Again, the prefix pav- 2PC is found, but this time in combination with
kul- 2PL 0 and -vkt PC, although -vkt PC seems to be somewhat optional
in these examples. Note that, as we saw with transitive verbs earlier (see
(5-29)), the first person A may not occur as a bound affix in these forms,THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS223but only as an independent pronoun; absence of a pronoun (5-52a) is
again interpreted to mean first singular.
Finally, there is the case of a paucal first person A and a singular
or dual second person 0. If the 0 is second singular the ubiquitous
kampan- ""' mpan- appears.
(5-53) a. uralJ
pa!Jkt k-mpan-tkam-r-!Jkt

'We few showed you a coconut. '
b . pa!Jkt !Jkul-cpul
lPC 2DL-hit
'We few hit you two.'
As usual, the number of the first person A must be indicated by an
independent pronoun, in this case, pavkt lPC, and only one pronominal
prefix is permitted, referencing the person and number of the 0. Note
that the paucal suffix is not present in (5-53b); in fact, its occurrence
will result in an ungrammatical construction.
(5-54) * pa!Jkt
1Jkul-cpul-c-1Jkt
lPC 2DL-hit-PERF-PC
The explanation for this is related to a claim made in Section 5.1.2.
There I asserted that non-singular second person A's are bound to their
verbs as the S prefix forms, while first person A's are not, but are simply
the independent pronouns. This is in spite of the fact that in both
cases the S prefix forms and the independent pronouns are completely
homophonous. Their differential behavior with respect to the paucal
suffix is a strong argument for this analysis, for a second person paucal
A occurs with it.
(5-55) a. pa-IJa-tpul-c-IJkt
2PC-1SG 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit me.'
b. pa-!Jkra-tpul-c-JJkt
2PC-1DL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit us two.'
Uut a first person paucal A does not:
(5-56) a. pa!Jkt !Jkul-cpul- * (IJkt)
lPC 2DL 0-hit-PC
'We few hit you two.'
b. pa!Jkt kul-cpul- * ( !Jkt)
lPC 2PL 0-hit-PC
'We few hit you all.'
This prohibition on -vkt PC is explained by the fact that pavkt is an224BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYindependent pronoun, not a bound affix, and that -vkt must be linked
to a bound person affix in its verb. Interestingly, (5-56b) with -vkt might
be expected to be grammatical if it were linked to kul- 2PL 0. But that
is not the case; in fact, if the second person is to be paucal, the prefix
pav- must be used.
(5-57) paJ]kt paJJ-kul-cpul-c-J]kt
lPC 2PC-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'We few hit you few.'
Again, - vkt is necessarily linked to a bound affix. The final very strong
piece of evidence for this analysis is provided by examples of verbs with
kampan- ""' mpan- , expressing a first person paucal A. This allows the
paucal suffix.
(5-58) uralJ
paJ]kt k-mpan-tkam-r-J]kt
coconut VI SG lPC VI SG T-1A/2SG D-show-PERF-PC
'We few showed you a coconut. '
This example conclusively demonstrates that i t is not the person of the
A which controls the distribution of -vkt PC, but whether it is expressed
through a bound verbal affix or not. As a first person A is indicated in
the bound portmanteau morpheme kampan- ""' mpan- 1A/2SG O,D, the
paucal suffix expressing its number is permitted.
Now let me turn to a few potentially ambiguous cases, verbs inflected
with the paucal suffix and having two plural or paucal participants. This
ambiguity is largely theoretical, for these verbs in practice almost never
truly are ambiguous. Verbs in which the paucal participant is second
person are often disambiguated by the prefix pav- 2PC.
( 5-59) paJ]kt palJ-kul-cpul-c-l]kt
lPC 2PC-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'We few hit you few. '
Here pav- indicates second paucal and in combination with the prefix
kul- 2PL 0 forces the reading of the 0 as second paucal and the pronoun
pavkt as the first person paucal A. Consider the alternative participant
arrangement:
( 5-60) pal]kt kra-tpul-c-l]kt
2PC lPL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit us few.'
Here the verbal prefix is the first person 0, kra- lPL 0, indicated as
paucal by the suffix -vkt. This clearly establishes the potentially am­
biguous independent pronoun pavkt as second person. Although the A is
therefore second person paucal, the prefix pav- 2PC is in fact prohibitedTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS225in this example, for its presence would result in homophony with the
verb expressing a first person dual 0 (see (5-50b)).
As a final example consider the following set of examples with a
paucal participant and a plural participant:
(5-61) a. ipa pau-kul-cpul-c-ukt
lPL 2PC-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'We hit you few. '
b . paukt kul-cpul
lPC 2PL 0-hit
'We few hit you all.'
c. ipwa-kra-tpul-c-ukt
2PL A-lPL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You all hit us few. '
d . paukt kra-tpul
2PC lPL-hit
'You few hit lis.'
Note that the verb form in (5-61a) is exactly the same as that of (559) : only the choice of the independent pronouns pavkt lPC versus
ipa lPL disambiguates the two. (5-61b) is unambiguous because the
lack of any paucal marking on the verb identifies the prefix kul- 2PL
0 as truly plural and by elimination pavkt must be first person. (561c) is also unambiguous because ipwa- is unambiguously plural and
therefore -vkt must be associated with kra- lPL 0. Finally, (5-61d)
has no paucal suffix, so kra- lPL must be plural and the pronoun pavkt
second person. (5-61d) has a second person paucal A, and we would
perhaps have expected it to be realized on the verb by the prefix paT)-,
producing the following:
(5-62) * pau-kra-tpul-c-JJkt
2PC-1PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'You few hit us.'
This, while a possible form, is in fact impossible in this meaning. This
is because (5-62) is completely homophonous with (5-55b) which is a
grammatical form expressing a first person dual 0.
5.1.5 The Forms of the Copula
The copula is used in equational, identificational and possessive state­
ments (for its function in the last type, see Section 4.5). The copula
always expresses a relation between two noun phrases, either establish­
i ng its identity or ascribing a quality to it. Consider these two examples:BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY226(5-63) a. k-n
akr!J
akk
VI SG-FR DIST tree frog VI SG COP VI SG INVIS
'That's a tree frog.'
b. m-n
kpa-n
anak
NP DIST-I SG big-I SG COP I SG
'He's big.' (literally 'he's a big one')
The first example would be in answer to the question 'what's that?' on
hearing a noise in the woods. The second ascribes the quality of bigness
to a human referent represented by m-n 'he'. Although kpa- 'big' is an
adjective base, when the concord marker - n is added it becomes a noun,
as discussed in Section 4.6; so again, (5-63b) demonstrates that copula
always connects two noun phrases.
The copula is the only truly irregular verb in Yimas, and it is highly
so. The underlying basic stem is (a) ya- to which the S prefix forms are
attached. But these prefixes generally metathesize to become infixes,
with often highly unpredictable results, so it seems best to simply list
the variant forms of the copula.","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"
"FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS431When the interrogative word functions as A, a cleft construction is
again required as long as the 0 participant is first or second person.

b. wara m-!Ja-am-ra?

'What bit me?'
But if the 0 participant is third person, a cleft construction is not used.
Instead an ordinary main clause is found, with a verbal pronominal
prefix cross-referencing the question word.

For core arguments other than S or A, cleft constructions are never
permissible. Further, the interrogative word cannot be cross referenced
on the verb by a pronominal affix. It is the obligatory absence of an affix
which distinguishes the case in which the interrogative word is 0 and
the A third person from the converse case above in (7-115). Contrast

'with'The branches directly off S can be rotated and shifted around freely with
no change in meaning, but this is not true of the next level of branches,
those corresponding to the phrasal units and the V. We have already
seen that the internal structure of the V is highly complex and hierar­
chically ordered. It may be that the very simple structure of the clause
level in Yimas compensates for the highly elaborate structure at lower
levels, especially inside the V. It is a commonplace among modern lin­
guistic theories that internal hierarchical structure is a universal feature
of language. This may be true, but languages like Yimas demonstrate
that such a structure need not be manifested at the clause level, where
it is commonly expected, but may show up elsewhere, where it is less
expected, for example, in the internal structure of the words. It may be
a truism that polysynthetic languages like Yimas choose to elaborate the
internal structure of words in contradistinction to phrases and clauses.
If one glances back at the phrase structure rules in (6-189) and (6194), an obvious generalization about Yimas emerges: the heads of con­
structions always occur to their right. The question then arises as to
what is the head of a clause. The only obligatory constituent of a clause
is, of course, the verb, and the rightmost obligatory constituent of a
verb is the tense morpheme. I suggest then that we consider TNS as the
head of its clause. In other words, as a noun phrase is defined by its
head noun and a postpositional phrase by its head postposition, so is
the category S defined by the tense morpheme.",[392]

The other basic mood categories in Yimas, imperatives and hortatives
are morphologically indicated by a verbal suffix.
5.2.3.1 Imperative Mood
Verbs in imperative mood are always associated with S or A arguments
which are second person (semantically they are agents). The impera­
tive mood always expresses a command which the speaker expects the
addressee will carry out. The diagnostic inflections for imperatives are
the imperative/hortative suffix - n (word-final position) alternating with
""' -na (elsewhere) , plus one of a set of pronominal prefixes which marks
the number of the addressee. If the addressee is singular, it is marked
by 0.( 5-141) a. mi tak wi-JJka-pra-n

the relative clause.

"436INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSFinite oblique clauses function like temporal words in the way that lo­
cational relative clauses act like locationals.
While locational relative clauses are the only means of expressing
clauses functioning in an oblique locational role, this is not true of tem­
poral clauses. In addition to the temporal relative clauses of (7-125),
it is also possible to add the oblique suffix directly to a clause. This
option is much less common and tends to be used if the verb is an ad­
jectival verb, or lacks pronominal affixes or if the clause in question is
equational. Miscellaneous examples of this follow:
(7-126) a. kunampwi pay-k-nan

What semantically distinguishes these oblique clauses formed with just
the oblique suffix from the temporal relative clauses is their overall
vagueness. Note that three of the four examples use vague tense markers
like the irrealis or the remote future in the oblique clause (and (7-126c)
would too, if the copula was present), and in the last example even the
A participant is left unspecified. This construction is limited to setting
relatively vague background conditions for the event in the main clause;
temporal relative clauses tend to be rather more specific and bound to a
clearer time interval, although with a gradient semantic dimension like
this it is difficult to be too precise about when to use one or the other
construction.","[451, 452]"
"6.2.3 Verb Stem Derivations: Valence Increasing
In contrast to its system of valence decreasing, which is quite impover­
ished, Yimas has a very rich system of devices for increasing the valence
of a verb root. These include causativization, which typically derives
a bivalent accomplishment verb stem from a monovalent state, achieve­
ment, or activity verb root (Vendler 1967) ; possessor-raising, which un­
der certain semantic conditions codes the possessor of a core S or 0
argument as the core D participant of the verb; and oblique promotion,
which allows an otherwise adverbial or oblique constituent, marked with
-nan ""' -n, to appear as a core argument of the verb and be indicated
by an pronominal affix. I will discuss each of these types in some detail
in the following sections.
6.2.3.1 Causativization
Causativization typically derives bivalent verb stems from verb roots
which are monovalent. The monovalent verb roots fall into three dif­
ferent semantic classes: states (e.g., sharp, heavy); achievements, alsoSTEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES289called processes ( Chafe 1970) (e.g., lose, break) ; and activities ( climb,
arise). As we shall see, these various semantic types of monovalent
verb roots behave differently under causativization. In addition, Yimas
possesses three separate formal devices to express causativization: lex­
ical, morphological (i.e., synthetic causatives), and syntactic (i.e., an­
alytical causatives) . As befits the status of Yimas as a polysynthetic
language, the border between the latter two is rather hazy, so that ""syn­
tactic"" may not be the best label to use for this last type of causative
formation.
6.2.3.1 . 1 Lexical Causatives. In many languages, a monovalent verb and
its corresponding bivalent causative may both be realized by separate
lexical verb roots. This is true of some verbs in Yimas as it is in English
(e.g., die: kill). Some examples in Yimas follow:
(6-24) a. na-mal
3SG S-die
'He died.'
b. na-n- tu-t

and 'show').
6.2.3. 1 .2 Non-productive Morphological Causatives. Monovalent a­
chievement verbs enter into a non-productive morphological deriva­
tional process with their corresponding bivalent causative accomplish­
ment verbs. The inchoative, the monovalent achievement verb, is marked
with -ara, and the causative, the bivalent accomplishment verb, with
- aca. This derivational pattern is no longer productive, rather like the
English causative affix - en. Often, the verbal root does not occur with­
out one of the derivational suffixes. Consider these examples:290THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTURE( 6-25 ) a. yan

'The tree split.' (say, along its base and fell over)
na-n-kumprak- aca-t
b. yan
tree V SG V SG 0-3SG A-split-CAUS-PERF
'He snapped the tree.' (with his hands)
( 6-25a) illustrates the inchoative achievement verb stem with - ara, while
( 6-25b) illustrates its causative accomplishment counterpart with - aca.
The verb in ( 6-25a) is monovalent and hence intransitive, while in ( 621b ) it is bivalent and transitive.
Interestingly, this is one of the verb roots which can occur without
any of these derivational affixes (kkrak- 'loosen' and kamprak- 'snap'
below are others) .
( 6-26 ) mi tanm
ma-kumprak-t?
2SG bone VII SG 2SG S-break-PERF
'Did you break any bones?'
The verb in ( 6-26 ) is bivalent and causative, but conveys an implication
that the event in question did not occur. Thus, the verb root contrasts
with the derived form with causative - aca in that it is not so strongly
completive, i.e., does not imply that accomplishment went through to a
notable or successful conclusion.
Other examples of verb stem pairs in - ara INCH and - aca CAUS are
given below:

in the causative stem, but there are also irregularities in the initial con­
sonants of the forms for 'bend' and 'stand up'. As the root forms are
not predictable they must be entered in the lexicon as variants of each
other, depending on the derivational affix chosen.
6.2.3. 1 .3 Productive Morphological Causatives. The constructions to be
treated here are those analogous to English causatives with make and
get (e.g., She made Ambrose wash the dishes ) in that they are formed
using independent verb roots, notably tal- 'hold' and tmi- 'say'. In a
causative construction, the latter is joined with other verb roots in a
serial verb construction to form a complex verb theme (see Section 6.3.1
on serial verb constructions). But in its causative use, tal- 'hold' already
seems to have been reanalyzed as a bound causative morpheme, for it
appears in two allomorphs tar- ,...., tal-, with the latter always occurring
before It I and /Y I and varying freely with the former elsewhere ( tar- ,....,
tal- contracts to t- before verb roots beginning in I arI , as in tar- CAUS
+ arpal- 'exit' > tarpal- 'cause to go out').
As might be expected from the basic verb root meanings of tar- ,....,
tal- 'hold' and tmi- 'say', there is a correlated meaning contrast between
them when they are used as causative morphemes. tar- ,...., tal- marks
direct causatives, the causing of an event by physically manipulating an
object, while tmi- is used for indirect causatives, in which the event is
brought about through speech, by verbal commands or requests. Con­
sider the following contrast:
(6-27) a. na-:ua-tar-kwalca-t
3SG A-lSG 0-CAUS-rise-PERF
' She woke me up.'
b. na-:ua-tmi-kwalca-t
3SG A-lSG 0-CAUS-rise-PERF
'She woke me up.'
While both (6-27a) and (6-27b) are translated as 'she woke me up', they
do not actually denote the same event. (6-27a) denotes waking someone
up by physical manipulation, say, by shaking, while (6-27b) indicates an
event caused by a verbal act, say, by calling someone's name or by yelling.
Other examples of causation through physical action, expressed by tar­
""' tal-, and causation through verbal action, indicated by tmi-, follow:

5.2. 1 .6 Aspectual Suffixes
The aspectual inflections presented thus far have all been restricted to
the present tense, so an obvious question is how are aspectual contrasts
in the past and future tenses expressed? Commonly, this is accomplished
by aspectual adverbials incorporated into the verbal complex, and these
will be discussed in detail in Section 6.3.2. In addition to these, there
are aspectual suffixes in Yimas which appear following the verb and in
combination with a tense inflection. These are the focus of this section.
These aspectual inflections are three in number: the completive, the
durational, and the immediate.
5.2.1.6.1 The Completive Aspect. This aspect expresses an event which
has gone to completion by totally affecting an object or by causing an en­
tire group of individuals to undergo the same change. It is expressed by
-rapi ""' - tapi , which are largely in free variation, except that - tapi must
occur after nasals and appear in its palatalized variant - capi after seg­
ments associated with the autosegment F. The completive aspect suffix
always precedes the relevant tense inflection as seen in the following:
(5-94) a. mi am-tap-Jla-rm
2SG consume-COMP-IMP-water
'Drink all of the water.'
ya-mpu-wayk-rap-Jlcut

'They bought all of the cartridges.'
pu-mal-capi-kia-k
c. num-n-mat
village-OBL-PL 3PL S-die-COMP-NIGHT-IRR
'All the villagers died.'
Note that the arguments modified by the completive suffix are always
absolutive, i.e., S or 0.
5.2.1 .6.2 The Durational Aspect. Continuative and durational aspect
is usually expressed by incorporated adverbial prefixes inside the verbal
complex. One of these incorporated adverbials used to express duration
with stance or positional verbs is nanav- DUR, transparently related
to the verb nav- 'live, dwell, stay at'. A contracted form of this, - nav
""' -na (the final /'fJ / disappears before a suffix beginning in a nasal) is250BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYused as a durative aspectual suffix, most commonly with the stance or
motion verbs, but is not restricted to these. This suffix normally occurs
in combination with the incorporated adverbial nanav-.

c . ku-mpi-nana!J-yawra-kia-na-ntut
X SG 0-3DL A-DUR-get-NIGHT-DUR-RM PAST
'Those two were getting it (the scrotum) . '
5.2.1.6.3 The Immediate Aspect. This aspectual contrast results from
a specialization of the temporal word, mpa 'just now, already' . This in
combination with the present tense suffix -nt (realized as - n in word­
final position) has become an enclitic, meaning 'still, now', which can
follow any verb, finite or non-finite.

'We were walking around looking for stalks of tobacco to roll

mpa can also be treated as an aspectual suffix meaning 'right now, just
yet' in the same affix position as -rapi ""' - tapi COMP and - nav ""' -na
DUR, i.e. , before a tense suffix or the imperative suffix. It is restricted
in that it can only co-occur with the perfective and the present tense
suffixes or the imperative.

The use of -kia with imperatives as in (5-84a) clearly demonstrates that
it may not be a tense morpheme, for imperatives are tenseless. Rather,
this command and the expected action were performed at night so that
-kia is used. The verb of (5-85b) is marked with the habitual suffix
-wat, but this action, sleeping, is one that is normally done at night,
so again the suffix -kia is present. (5-84c) is drawn from a traditional
legend and exhibits the typical usage of the irrealis -k in such texts. But
this sentence occurs at a particular point in the text when the scene
switches from day to night. Thus, the suffix -kia now appears, although
it was not used in the previous sentences of the text. Note that -kia
is not only used on the main verb, but also occurs on the preceding
nonfinite purpose clause, again demonstrating that it is not strictly a
tense morpheme. Finally, consider the last example (5-84d). This comes
from a story describing events which occurred a year previously, hence
the use of - ntut RM PAST. The particular event of (5-84d) occurred
at night, so -kia is used, while in most of the other sentences in the
text, which describe daytime events, it is absent. (There is yet a further
specialized use of -kia with - ntut RM PAST, which does not actually
specify night time, but functions to express far past, i.e., events from
the day before yesterday and back. This will be discussed in detail in
Section 5.2.1.3.2.)
5.2.1.3 The Past Tenses
5.2.1.3.1 The Remote Past. The remote past occurs in two basic allo­
rnorphs -ntut and - ntuk, the former in word-final position and the latter
elsewhere. Both allomorphs are subject to the truncation rule (rule (21 5)) which deletes the initial nasal when the previous morpheme ends in
a nasal ( klv- 'cut and dispose of' + - ntut RM PAST > klvtut or am- 'con­
sume' + - ntut RM PAST > amtut ) . Both allomorphs are, of course, also
subject to the palatalization rule (rule (2-3)) if the previous morpheme
Pnds in a segment with the F autosegment, as in tay- 'see' + - ntut RM
PAST > tapcut or awl- 'get' + - ntut RM PAST > awtpcut (the second
Pxample also illustrates rule (2-5), liquid strengthening) . The non-final
allomorph - ntuk always triggers R spreading into a following V. The
final /k/ of this allomorph is subject to loss before the paucal suffix
- vkt, as in - ntuk RM PAST + -vkt PC > - ntuvkut (by /k/ loss and R
Hpreading) .
The remote past is used to describe events in the continuum of real
t i me, but most removed from the present now. The actual time span242BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYwhich it covers, however, is quite sensitive to contextual differences.
Minimally, an event must be five days removed from today, but even
events of a few years or more ago may be presented in the far past,
rather than the remote past, if they seem especially near, important, or
vivid to the narrator. Perhaps the best way to describe the time span
covered by the remote past is as the period between the far past , which
covers relatively near or vivid past events, and the legendary past, which
is outside of real time and is best expressed via the irrealis. It is not
uncommon for texts to begin in the remote past, but to switch in mid­
stream to either the irrealis or the far past, depending on the pragmatic
effects the speaker wishes to achieve. The irrealis distances the events
further, making them timeless, while the far past brings them closer to
the present and makes them more vivid.
A couple of examples of the use of the remote past follow:
(5-86) a. rna
.uar.u
na-n-way-mpiother 1 day removed 3SG 0-3SG A-turn-SEQira-ya-ntut
toward-come-RM PAST
'Next day she came back to him.'

flying fox VIII PL before underneath of house V PL-OBL
wa-nana.u-irm-tut
VIII PL-DUR-stand-RM PAST
'Before flying foxes always hung from the underneath of
houses. '
5.2.1.3.2 The Far Past. The far past is used for events viewed as closer in
time or more vivid than those expressed in the remote past. It is formed
by compounding -kia with the remote past, thus -kiantut ""' -kiantuk,
and the latter is subject to the same phonological rules as the remote
past allomorph - ntuk.
The first and most obvious question concerning -kiantut FR PAST is
why is it formed with the suffix -kia? This again finds an explanation
of the traditional Yimas reckoning of the day from sunset to sunset.
Remember that any given night is always the same day as the following
noon. Hence any previous night in the past is actually in a time period
closer to the present now than is the day preceding that night. Hence
the re-analysis of -kia-ntut NIGHT-RM PAST to CLOSER-RM PAST >
FR PAST finds a ready explanation.
The far past -kiantut ""' -kiantuk covers past events from the day be­
fore yesterday to a year or even a few years ago. The boundary betweenTENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD243the remote past and the far past is vague and is exploited by speak­
ers for stylistic effect. The use of the remote past distances the events
in time and feeling, while the far past brings them closer, enhancing
them and adding a more vivid coloring. Thus, events of two years ago
could quite easily be narrated in either the remote or far past, but with
these pragmatic, stylistic differences noted. Interestingly, -kia can also
be used with -k IRR when this replaces the remote past in legends and
myths. Again this provides a closer, more vivid coloring to the events
thus presented. Examples involving the far past follow:
( 5-87) a. paJJkra-kwalca-mpi-cu-JJka-pu-kiantu-JJkt
IPC S-get up-SEQ-out-go-away-FR PAST-PC
'We few got up and went outside.'
b. trawsistm
tma-mpu-JJa-JJa-kiantut
trousers V DL V DL T-3PL A-ISG 0-give-FR PAST
'They gave me two pairs of trousers.'
5.2.1.3.3 The Near Past. The near past is that with the most clearly
defined temporal limits: it marks events which occurred yesterday. If
one is talking at noon about an event which occurred on the previous
noon, that event will always be presented in the near past. But because
of the conflict between the traditional Yimas reckoning of a day from
sunset to sunset and the modern English/Tok Pisin based one of sunrise
to sunrise, there is some confusion about last night and the night before
last. Generally, a speaker talking at noon about events of the previous
night will describe them as occurring during (kwarkwa) wut ' ( today)
night' and will use the perfective suffix on the verb, equivalent to a
present tense suffix for events which have already occurred today. This
is the expected result if the day is calculated from sunset to sunset.
There are, however, some younger speakers who follow the sunrise to
sunrise pattern and will describe such events as occurring during varv
wut ' I day removed night', but they will still use the perfective suffix on
the verb. The near past in this usage is completely unacceptable by all
speakers.
The night before last is more problematic, and younger speakers
are unsure as to whether to describe it as varv wut ' I day removed
night' or urakrv wut '2 days removed night', although older speakers
more consistently used varv wut ' I day removed night'. All speakers use
the far past, rather than the expected near past to describe this time
period. The near past is never used to describe events which occur red
at night, and it is important to note that the suffix -kia is never used in
combination with the near past.
The baRic form of the near past iH -nan, but the final nasal disap-244BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYpears whenever it is followed by a suffix. The initial /n/ is subject to
palatalization rule (2-3) when it follows a segment associated with the
autosegment F. Examples of the near past follow:
(5-88) a. � ar�
pia-ka-i-jla-mpun

'I told them yesterday.'
b. antki
ya�kay-kl� -nan
thatch IV PL IV PL 0-1PL A-cut and dispose-NR PAST
'We cut off and disposed of the thatch yesterday.'
5.2.1.4 The Present Tenses
The present tense covers events which have occurred or are occurring
today or could occur on any day including today (i.e., habitual actions).
Because of the traditional reckoning of the day from sunset to sunset,
when a speaker is talking at noon about events which are fully expected
to occur in the coming night, these are always expressed in the near
future, the tense of tomorrow, which, of course, commences with the
coming sunset. Generally, events of the previous night are described in
the present tense. Strictly speaking, there is no straightforward present
tense morpheme in Yimas; rather there are three different aspectual cat­
egories expressed within the overall present tense category: perfective,
imperfective, and habitual.
5.2.1.4.1 The Perfective. This marks events which have already occurred
and been completed during today, including last night. It may also
occasionally be used to mark completed events, especially changes of
state, when the time of completion is unknown or irrelevant. Because
last night is the same day as today according to the traditional Yimas
reckoning, this is the inflection typically used to describe events which
occurred then. If one is speaking at noon about events of last night one
would simply use wut 'night' plus the perfective. The night suffix -kia
is never used in combination with the perfective.
The basic form of the perfective is -r, but it is subject to extensive
allomorphic variation. In word-final position it is realized as t by the
rule of final r strengthening (rule (2-4)). Thus, wu- 'take in hand' +
-r PERF > wut. The perfective is also realized in non-final position as
t if the previous syllable contains a /r/ by the rule of r dissimilation
(rule (2-6) ) as follows: kra- 'cut' + -r PERF + - akn 3SG D > kratakn.
The perfective has the allomorph 0 in word-final position following the
palatalizing segments /i/, /1/, and /y/ ( awl- 'get' + -r PERF > awl; and
tay- 'see' + -r PERF > tay). This is probably the result of a prohibition
on /c/ in word-final position, as this would be the expected realization.","[256, 257, 258, 259, 260]"
"Evidence that the non-singular second person A's in (5-29c, d) are bound
to the verbs, but that these first person A's are not is presented in
the discussion of negation (see Section 5.2.2.1). As (5-29a) shows, a
first singular A is assumed in the absence of an overt pronoun. These
examples indicate that in the conflict between principles one and two for
the ordering of the first and second person A and 0 prefixes, the second
is the more important, for it is the 0 which is realized as the verbal
prefix, as principle two would require, in spite of the fact that it is the
lower ranking participant by principle one.
5.1.3 Ditransitive Verbs and the Expression of the Dative
So far I have been using the notions of transitive and intransitive in a
descriptive and rather pre-theoretical manner. As we shall see in Section
5.1.6, these notions are not without their problems when applied to Yi­
mas, but for the time being I will continue to use them as I have defined
above. In addition to the many intransitive and transitive verbs, Yimas
has four inherently ditransitive verbs, although many basic transitive
verbs can be made ditransitive through the valence increasing prefixes
(see Section 6.2.3). These four basic ditransitive verbs are va- 'give', i­
'tell someone', tkam- 'show', and pul- 'rub on'. Ditransitive verbs are
distinctive in Yimas by allowing three pronominal affixes, the third one
being used to express what is called in traditional grammar the indirect
object or dative case, as boy in the girl gave the snake to the boy. The
range of this third affix in Yimas is much wider than simply the indirect
object in English and corresponds to many uses of the dative case in
classical languages like Latin, so I will refer to these affixes as the dative
affixes (abbreviation: D). For first and second person, these dative af­
fixes are, in fact, homophonous with the 0 prefixes, but for third person
there is a distinct set of dative suffixes.
(5-30) a. ura!J
k-mpu-va-tkam-t
coconut VI SG VI SG 0-3PL A-lSG D-show-PERF
'They showed me the coconut.'
b. ura!J
k-mpu-tkam-r-mpn
coconut VI SG VI SG 0-3PL A-show-PERF-3DL D
'They showed them two the coconut. '
Note that the dative affixes are the same as the 0 forms only in the
first and second persons, the persons that align participant roles ac­
cording to a nominative-accusative schema. In the third person forms,THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS209which follow an ergative-absolutive alignment, the dative suffixes are
distinct from both the A and 0 prefix forms. This suggests that the
first and second persons follow not so much a nominative-accusative
schema, as a nominative-dative one, in accord with Silverstein's (1976,
1980) claim of the underlying salience of the nominative-dative case op­
position. Although the 0 and D prefixes for first and second person
are homophonous, they must be regarded as distinct because of their
different substitution possibilities: 0 prefixes by third person absolutive
prefixes and D prefixes by third person dative suffixes. This claim is
further buttressed by their behavior in relativization (see Section 7.2.1).
The data on the verbal pronominal suffixes presented so far demon­
strates a fundamental split between the first and second persons on the
one hand and third person on the other. First and second person have
a three way split between S, A, and 0, with D equivalent formally to
0. This is of course, underlaid by a nominative-accusative system (or
nominative-dative) with S = A and opposed to 0 /D. Third person forms
exhibit an ergative-absolutive system with S = 0 opposed to A and with
a distinct D series. The differences between the persons can be summa­
rized as follows:
D
S
A
0
IJa1/2 kaama-mpn
impa3 mpiIn the accusatively marking persons 0 collapses with D, but in the erga­
tively marking person, it collapses with S. Is there a unified notion of 0
that lies behind these different encodings? This question parallels the
earlier one whether there is a unified notion of subject underneath the
nominative-accusative/ergative-absolutive split based on person. Both
questions are far too complex to answer completely here, and data bear­
i ng on them will be continually presented when I treat the syntax of
clauses and complex sentences in Chapters 6 and 7. The vast major­
ity of syntactic processes in Yimas are realized through morphological
devices, and the grammatical relations involved in these processes are
those reflected in the morphology. Hence when the morphology reflects
this person-based split, there is scant evidence to support the claim of
a unity underlying that split. There are, however, a few syntactic con­
Htructions which do provide evidence for unified notions of subject and
object, and this will be noted when they are discussed. But at this point
I will stick closely to the various categories that the morphology justifies.
Now let me return to the examples in (5-30). Even though I have
n�jected the idea of a morphologically coherent notion of 0 for ditran­
H it.ive verbs, equivalent to the 0 of transitive verbs, I can still proposeBASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY210rather straightforward analyses. In (5-30a), the verb tkam 'show' is as­
sociated with three core arguments. The initiating participant, the A,
is third person plural and is realized by the proper prefix mpu- 3PL A.
The next participant is the dative nominal, the participant to whom
the coconut is shown. Because the dative participant is first singular, a
person-number combination whose marking of participant relations fol­
lows a nominative-dative schema, it will be realized by the prefix va-,
the 0 form, or perhaps more precisely, the non-nominative form. Be­
cause the first person participant outranks the third person participant
by the first hierarchical principle, its prefix will occupy the ranking po­
sition closer to the verb stem. Finally, the remaining core participant,
urav 'coconut', a class VI singular noun, is realized on the verb by the
corresponding prefix of that class and number, k-. Because it is the low­
est ranking prefixed participant, its prefix will occur first. Now consider
( 5-30b). Again the verb is the ditransitive tkam 'show', and the first
of the three arguments is the third plural A marked by the prefix mpu3PL A. But in the example, the dative participant is third dual, and this
is a person/ number combination which follows an ergative-absolutive
schema. In these cases there is a distinct set of suffixes for dative partic­
ipants and the proper form here is -mpn 3DL D. Finally, the remaining
core participant urav 'coconut' is realized by its prefix k-, which as the
lower ranking of the two prefixes, occurs initially.
In these analyses, the underlying participant relations of (5-30a,b)
are identical. The differences in structure are accounted for by the same
general split in case marking schema that we saw with transitive verbs:
first and second person work accusatively (nominative-dative schema)
and third person works ergatively (ergative-absolutive-dative schema) .
The main point with ditransitive verbs is that the dative participants
marked with the prefixes identical in form to the 0 prefixes are not in an
0 relation; that is, the grammatical relationship between such a prefix
and its governing ditransitive verb differs from that of the same prefix
with a governing transitive verb. The notion of 0 is an applicable and
useful notion for transitive verbs, but is not extendable to ditransitive
verbs in Yimas. We may summarize the core arguments with the three
basic types of verbs in Yimas as follows,
intransitive verb:
transitive verb:
ditransitive verb:s
A
A0
TDwhere T refers to the theme core argument, that which is shown, given,
etc., i.e., whose location is at issue (Foley and Van Valid 1984). These
can only be third person in Yimas and must always be realized by theTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE N OMINALS211first agreement prefix. A final point to be noted from these examples is
the form of the A prefix in (5-30a) . Compare this to the corresponding
transitive verb in (5-14b). In spite of its preceding the prefix va- 1SG
0, the A actually must appear in the A prefix form mpu- rather than
being optionally neutralized to the S/0 form pu-, as in (5-14b) . This is
because it does not occur initially in (5-30a) , but follows another prefix
k-. This is conclusive proof that the neutralization to the S/0 form
initially for third person prefixes (e.g. , (5-14b) ) is, as claimed, simply a
surface reflex of being in initial position, and nothing more. When not
in initial position, the true A form emerges.
Now we are ready to look in more detail at the morphology of di­
transitive verbs and the dative suffixes. The forms of the dative suffixes
for the three numbers in third person are as follows:
SG
- (n)aknDL
-mpnPL
-mpun(5-31) a. k-ka-tkam-r-akn
VI SG T-1SG A-show-PERF-3SG D
' I showed him (the coconut) . '
b. k-ka-tkam-tuk-nakn
VI SG T-1SG A-show-RM PAST-3SG D
'I showed him (the coconut) long ago.'
c. k-nan-tkam-r-mpun
VI SG T-2PL A-show-PERF-3PL D
'You all show them (the coconut).'
As (5-31a,b) demonstrate, there is some allomorphic variation for the
third singular dative suffix. - akn occurs following a [-peripheral] conso­
nant and - nakn occurs elsewhere.
A salient feature of all three dative suffixes is the final -n. This, of
course, bears a transparent relationship to the oblique suffix -n ,...., - nan.
The dative is in many ways a transitional relation between the true core
relations, represented by A, S, and 0, and the oblique, peripheral re­
lations of location and time (see Foley 1986, 96-8), and these Yimas
dative suffixes clearly seem to be formerly independent pronominal el­
Pments followed by the oblique suffix which have become bound to the
verb and reanalyzed as suffixes. These forms must always occur in ab­
Holute final position in the verb. If another suffix should follow them,
there are suppletive variants of these suffixes which must be used.
SG

b . ta-nan-tkam-r-mpan-JJ
NEG-2PL A-show-PERF-3PL D-VI SG T
'You all didn't show them (the coconut).'
These suppletive variants may represent the earlier basic forms of the D
suffixes, which were replaced in verb final position by the present day
verb final D suffixes when they became bound to the verb.
These D suffixes almost invariably reference human participants, but
one of the ditransitive verbs, pul- 'rub on', does allow inanimate nouns
to be marked by the dative suffixes. In these cases the noun class of the
inanimate D noun is never indicated, just its number.
(5-33) kacmpt
anti
canoe VIII PL ground VIII SG
i-kay-pul-e-mpun
VIII SG T-lPL A-rub-PERF-3PL D
'We rubbed ground on the canoes.'
kacmpt 'canoes' is a class VIII plural noun functioning as the D argument
of the ditransitive verb pul- 'rub on'. But because the D suffixes only
indicate number, it is impossible to mark its class, and so only its number
is indicated by the D suffix - mpun 3PL D.
Generally the conjugations of ditransitive verbs follow the rules given
earlier for transitive verbs-with the added complication, of course, of
another core argument. Ditransitive verbs associated only with third
person participants differ from the corresponding transitive verbs (5-19)
only in the presence of the D suffixes.

c. makaw

'They gave makau to them.'
The fourth inherently ditransitive verb, i- 'tell someone', is constrained
in that its theme argument must always be filled by the verbal prefix
pia-, referring to 'talk, language':THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS213(5-35) a. pia-mpu-i-c-akn

'They told him.'
b. pia-n-i-c-mpun
talk T-3SG A-tell-PERF-3PL D
'He told them.'
Ditransitive verbs with a third person participant and a first or sec­
ond person participant are formed in two ways, depending on which is
A and which is D (we can ignore the theme argument here and in the
following because it is almost invariably inanimate or of relatively low
animacy status and never plays any role in determining the conjugation
of a ditransitive verb) . Because the first or second person participant is
higher ranking by hierarchical principle one, it will occupy the ranking
position of the pronominal prefix closest to the verb. If it functions as
A, it will appear in its proper A prefix form and the third person D will
appear as a D suffix.

'You two gave them both makau.'
c. pia-kay-i-c-akn
talk T-lPL A-tell-PERF-3 SG D
'We told him.'
If, on the other hand, the first or second person participant is the D
argument, it will be realized by the same prefix form as the 0 of a
transitive verb. It will still be the inner prefix because it is the highest
ranked, but the third person A will precede it in the A prefix form,
preceded in turn by the lowest ranking prefix, that for the T argument.

There is no example parallel to (5-37a,b) in which the A is third
singular. We have seen earlier with the transitive verbs that the third
singular form in Yimas is completely homophonous with second singular
and that is the case here. The rules which apply to second person A's214BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYfor ditransitive verbs apply to third singular as well. Ditransitive verbs
with first and second person participants differ in certain respects from
the corresponding transitive verbs. With the exception of verbs with a
first person A and a second singular D, it is not possible to mark both A
and D participants with pronominal prefixes. If the D argument is first
person and the A second person (or third singular), the D argument will
occur as the verb prefix for it is higher ranked. The A, if present at
all, must occur as an independent pronoun. This is in contrast to the
situation with transitive verbs, in which second person A's surface with
the S prefix forms (see (5-27)) .

d. pia-!Ja-i

'Youjhe told me.'
As can be gleaned from examples (5-38a,d) , verbs without associated
independent pronouns are ambiguous between a second or third person
singular A. These sentences can, of course, be disambiguated by adding
the independent pronoun mi 2SG for second singular or the near distal
deictic form m-n NR DIST-I/II SG 'he, she' for third singular.
Finally, for ditransitive verbs with a first person A and a second
person D, only the situation in which the D argument is second singular
allows marking of both participants on the verb. This is again done by
the suppletive form kampan- ""' mpan-. Number of the first person A
must be indicated by an independent pronoun; without such, singular is
assumed.

If the secopd person D argument is non-singular, then the suppletive
morpheme is not available. Only one of the two participants may be
realized by a verbal prefix, and parallel to the situation with transitive
verbs (5-29), this must be the second person D argument, rather than
the first person A. The A is then expressed through an independent
pronoun. Again, with no overt pronoun, a first person singular A is
assumed, unless context forces otherwise.

tion (rule (2-3)) of the following /n/ of na- DEF and undergoes liquid
strengthening (rule (2-5)) . The same verb form, but in the perfective,
has a zero verb stem, because it gets absorbed by the preceding palatal.

Tables 5-7 summarize the inflection with pronominal affixes of intran­
sitive, transitive and ditransitive verbs, respectively. (All forms are in
remote past tense. )216BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY5.1.4 The Indication of Paucal Number
If one glances back to the array of pronouns presented in Section 3. 7, he
will note that Yimas actually distinguishes four numbers in its indepen­
dent pronouns: singular, dual, paucal, and plural. The paucal expresses
a set of a few; more than two and usually less than seven, but the ex­
act number varies quite widely according to context. Prototypically,
however, it refers to a class of three to five individuals, and is always
restricted to humans. So far in the exposition of the verbal pronominal
affixes, I have ignored the indication of paucal number. This is because
this number category works rather differently from the other three, and
it seemed simplest to postpone its introduction for ease of exposition. It
is now time to remedy this omission.
The expression of paucal number in a Yimas verb is, in fact, one
of the more complicated parts of the verbal morphology, although its
general pattern is like that outlined above for transitive and ditransi­
tive verbs. Again, there is the pervasive split in behavior between first
and second persons, on the one hand, and third person, on the other.
Basically, first and second person participants with paucal number do
not have distinctive person-number prefixes of their own. These use
the plural prefixes functioning in their normal three way role marking
contrast, in combination with the paucal suffix - vkt (realized as - vkut
by R spreading (rule (2-8)) following a tense suffix containing a fuf,
notably - ntuk RM PAST) . The third person paucal participants have
a distinct set of pronominal prefixes which follow the usual ergative­
absolutive schema for this person. Thus, consider the following paucal
forms for first person.
(5-42) a. pavkra-wa-t
1/2 PC S-go-PERF
'Wefyou few went. '
b . pu-kay-cay-c-vkt
3PL 0-1PL A-see-PERF-PC
'We few saw them.'
c. pu-kra-cay-c-vkt
3PL A-1SG 0-see-PERF-PC
'They saw us few.'
pavkra- is the bound S form for first and second person paucal and is
transparently related to the corresponding independent pronoun pavkt
1/2 PC. For the A and 0 forms there is no distinct paucal form. Rather
the plural prefixes, kay- 1PL A and kra- 1PL 0 are used, in combination
with the paucal suffix - vkt. This paucal suffix is in fact rather like the
third person D suffixes in that it must occur in absolute final positionTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS217TABLE 6Inflection with Pronominal Affixes of Transitive

The verb root ant- 'hear' is a perception verb for which typically the
perceiver (A participant) and the source of noise (the 0 participant)
are in a different place. In (6- 143) the elevational prefix l- 'down' can
only be interpreted as indicating the location of the slit drum (the 0
participant) , not the perceivers.
Transitive verbs of motion where the A participant moves toward the
0 argument or where the 0 participant itself moves are parallel: it is
the location or the direction of movement of the 0 participant which is
coded by the elevational/ directional prefixes.

In (6-144a), the A participant moves toward the 0 participant, the po­
sition of which is specified by l- 'down' as below the point of origin for
the movement. Example (6-144b) illustrates the setting in motion of the
0 participant by an action of the A participant. Again, it is the direc­
tion of the 0 (in this case, many directions) which is expressed by the
elevational/directional prefix tra- 'about'. Finally, (6-144c) illustrates a
case where through the action of the A participant, the 0 participant
actually comes into being. Again, the directional prefix tra- 'about' in­
dicates the location of these created objects (0 participant) not that of
the creators (A participant) .
The final question to be addressed in this section is the placement
of elevational/directional inflections in the morphological derivation of
a verb. They have been treated here as morphemes added at the level
of the verb theme and this analysis works well for the great major­
ity of cases. For example, an elevational/directional prefix usuallyTHEME DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES351appears before a serial verb construction, just as with incorporated
adverbials.

1DL S-down-turn-SEQ-run-toward-NIGHT-IRR
'We turned around and ran down here. '
I n each example o f (6-145), an elevational/directional prefix precedes
a complex verb theme which is of a serial verb construction. And in
each case, the prefix actually semantically modifies the last verb root
in the serial construction, the one farthest removed from it. Clearly,
by these examples, elevationals/directionals must be analyzed as mor­
phemes added at the level of the verb theme, parallel to incorporated
adverbials.
However, there are problems with this claim, for there exist exam­
ples where the prefixes occur inside serial verb constructions, like stem
derivational affixes.

These exceptions fall into two clearly defined types. In the first type,
the elevationalfdirectional follows the basic motion verbs wa- 'go' and
ya- 'come' joined in a serial construction by -ka SEQ, as illustrated in
(6-146a,b). It may be that serialization of these two verbs using -ka SEQ
iH a later stage in the derivation, itRelf a derivation at the verb theme352THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTURElevel. In other words, in (6- 146b) a complex verb theme is first com­
posed by serializing the verb root ta- 'put' and the verb stem tantaw­
'sit down'. To this verb theme is then added the directional prefix ma­
'in' . Finally, this complex theme is then serialized again at the theme
level with ya- 'come' to form the final complex serial verb construction.
This analysis finds some plausibility in that it is strictly lexically gov­
erned by the two basic motion verbs; it needs to be stipulated as an
option restricted to these verbs in the grammar. This construction how­
ever, is only optional and is not obligatory as example (6-145a) clearly
demonstrates, for there kaw- 'inside' precedes ya- 'come' + -ka SEQ in
a serial construction.
The second two examples illustrate the other type of exception, which
involves the verb roots, vka- 'go by land' and impu- 'go by water'. These
exceptions are explained by the fact that the elevational/directional pre­
fixes are probably already associated lexically with these verb roots, so
that the prefix plus root should be regarded as a single verb stem. This
explanation is immediately confirmed by the observation that it is pos­
sible to use two elevational/directional prefixes with these verbs, one
before the root and joined at the stem level, and one at the level of the
verb theme, preceding the serial verb construction.

Having established that the elevational/ directional prefixes are mor­
phemes added at the level of the verb theme, we need to consider their
ordering constraints with the other morphemes added at this level, in­
corporated adverbials. Although these morphemes function at the same
level their sequential order is rigid; the adverbial must precede the ele­
vational/directional (see also examples (6-138b) and (6-141d)) .

"YIMAS AS A POLYSYNTHETIC LANGUAGE279These sentences are nearly synonymous, and both are regarded as gram­
matical by native speakers. (There may be a subtle semantic difference
between them equivalent to 'He turned and came toward her' (6-2a) ver­
sus 'He turned toward her and came (toward her) ' (6-2b), but all speak­
ers queried regarded them as practically equivalent. Note that while
the two English sentences above have different structures and might be
said to have different meanings, they clearly can denote the same event.)
The formal difference between the two examples in (6-2) concerns the
placement of the allative valence increasing prefix ira- 'toward, because
of' (see Section 6.2.3.3.3). It is this prefix which sanctions the 0 prefix
na- 3SG 0 for this complex which only contains two intransitive verbs,
way- 'turn' and ya- 'come'. Note that regardless of whether ira- ALL
is placed immediately before ya- (6-3a) or precedes both verb roots (63b), it still licenses the appearance of na- 3SG 0 at the beginning of the
whole verb, demonstrating its integrity as a single grammatical word.
A final argument in favor of the analysis of the complex expressions
in ( 6-1 ) as single words concerns the behavior of modifying forms such as
those for aspect, modality, and mood. Note that the aspectual marker
nanav- DUR modifies both verbs in (6-1b) , as does the negative prefix
in (6-1c). This latter does not mean * 'again those few did not see her,
but they again came back'. This principle also applies to the scope of
mampi 'again' in this example: it modifies both verbs. In the text from
which (6-1c) is drawn, the expression describes the second time in which
someone who has fallen out of a canoe is ignored and the people paddled
on. Thus, the intended interpretation: ""Again those few did not see her
and again those few did not come back (for her).""
These arguments establish fairly conclusively that the constructions
in ( 6-1) are best analyzed as single words. Thus, Yimas is a polysynthetic
language. There is a very strong tendency throughout Yimas grammar
to reduce complex expressions to single words, as befits its polysynthetic
status. In the above examples, clauses and even complex sentences are
realized as single words. This tendency also finds articulation in the
system of nominals, discussed in Sections 4.4 and 4.6. As pointed out,
Yimas productively forms compounds with two nouns, the head noun
to the right and the other suffixed with the oblique suffix - n ""' - nan.

These nominal compounds are further examples of this polysynthetic
tendency to reduce complex expressions to single words. That these
form single words is indicated by the fact that they may serve as the
head of possessive constructions,
(6-4) [ama-na
[num-un

1SG-POSS village-OBL pig III SG
'my domesticated pig'
while true noun phrases may not.
(6-5) * [ama-na
[kpa [numpran]]]
1SG-POSS big pig III SG
These same constraints apply to the tightly knit noun phrases con­
sisting of a modifier plus a noun discussed in Section 4.6. In many ways
these too behave as single words. For example, the oblique suffix may
occur only once, on the head noun,
(6-6) a. [rna
kay]-Jlan
other canoe VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe'
*
b. ma-nan

while in the loose, scrambling type of nominal constituents, it may occur
on both modifier and noun.
(6-7) kay-Jlan
ma-y-Jlan
canoe VIII SG-OBL other- VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe.'
The moral of this discussion of Yimas as a polysynthetic language is
that Yimas is one language in which the distinction between the gram­
matical levels of word and phrase is hazy at best and perhaps non­
existent. (In the next chapter we shall see that a similar haziness applies
to the border between clause and sentence.) Basically, it is the genius of
Yimas to employ many grammatical devices in a conspiracy to reduce
phrase-level units to word-level ones. This is closely related to the fact
that Yimas is syntactically a very flat language (see Hale 1983; Blake
1983): that is, the basic relations in Yimas syntactic constructions are
syntagmatic, forms following forms in linear sequence, rather than in aSTEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES281hierarchical arrangement. We shall see many examples of this property
in the next two chapters. One of the results of this resistance to hierar­
chy is that phrase-level structures are formally rather like words. Thus,
instead of [black[dog]), in which the hierarchical structure is indicated by
the level of bracketing, the Yimas equivalent is rather more like [black­
dog] , in which the components are syntagmatically related on the same
level.
Returning now to the examples in (6-1), it will be noted that I have
marked off a sequence of morphemes in each example by enclosing them
within brackets. This simply sets off the verbal morphology discussed
in the previous chapter from the rest of the verb whose structure will
be discussed in this chapter. A verb is made up of the basic verbal
morphology already presented, which corresponds to the verb periphery
and what I will term the verb theme. Verb themes may themselves be
complex, composed at least of one verb stem plus a set of optional verbal
affixes and incorporated adverbials. For example, in (6-la) the verb
theme is composed of the verb stem takat- 'touch' plus the prefixes pay­
'first' and ma- 'in'. The verb theme of (6-lc) is composed of two verb
stems taympi- 'see' and waraca- 'return' plus the incorporated adverbial
mampi- 'again' . A verb stem is in turn composed of no more than one
verb root plus optional derivational affixes. In (6- le), the verb stem is
composed of the verb root kulanav 'walk' and the derivational affixes
tav- COM and tal- CAUS.
The last chapter dealt with the basic verbal morphology of pronomi­
nal affixes: tense, aspect, modality, and mood. These categories form the
basis of the verb periphery and correspond to the morphemes which oc­
cur outside the verb theme, those morphological categories which apply
to it as a whole. In this chapter ,I will be concerned with the morphol­
ogy internal to the verb theme, that complex verbal morphology which
is particularly indicative of Yimas as a polysynthetic language. Because
this morphology is so complex, it is necessary to proceed from the basic
units and build up the morphological structure of the theme, brick by
brick. Thus, we start with the structure of the verb stem and its con­
struction from a verb root and, more specifically, with the question of
the transitivity of Yimas verbs.
6.2 Stem Derivational Processes
6.2.1 The Concept of Transitivity
Yimas is a language in which it is very important to make a clear dis­
tinction between the syntactic-semantic notion of the valence of a verb
and the formal morphological idea of transitivity. Very often there is a
mismatch between these two concepts, much more so than in more fa-282THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREmiliar languages like English. In Yimas, transitivity is defined formally,
by the number of overt pronominal affixes present: an intransitive verb
has no more than one pronominal affix, a transitive verb has two, and
a ditransitive verb has three. Valence, on the other hand, is a lexical
feature of verbs, either basic verb roots or derived verb stems and verb
themes. Verbs with one associated core argument are monovalent, those
with two are bivalent and those with three are trivalent. Yimas neither
allows verbs with more than three pronominal prefixes nor possesses
verbs, either basic or derived, with more than three core arguments.
In English and many other languages, there is generally a straight­
forward correspondence between transitivity and valence: monovalent
verbs are intransitive, bivalent verbs are transitive, and trivalent verbs
are ditransitive. This is not always transparently so in Yimas. First of
all, as pointed out in Section 5.1.6, overt pronominal affixes are not oblig­
atory, but are linked to pragmatic functions like givenness, etc. Hence
it is not unusual for a trivalent verb like va- 'give' to appear as an in­
transitive or simple transitive verb, with only one or two pronominal
prefixes.
(6-8) m-n
patn
ka-ua-ua-n
NR DIST-1 SG betelnut V SG LIKE-lSG D-give-PRES
'He will give me betelnut.'
Or a bivalent verb like wampaki 'throw' can be used intransitively with
only a single pronominal affix.
(6-9) nmpi
ay-cra-wampak-Jla-ukt
leaf VII PL HORT PL-around-throw-IMP-PC
'Let us few distribute letters.'
Examples like these were discussed earlier in Section 5.1.6, and it was
claimed there that they present cases of zero pronominal affixes. With
this analysis, the valence and transitivity of these verbs are in a one­
to-one correspondence; this is simply disguised by the zero pronominal
prefixes. By virtue of the completeness constraint, zero pronominal pre­
fixes are, of course, directly linked to core nominal arguments such as
patn 'betelnut' or nmpi 'leaves', so that all argument slots of these verbs
are in fact filled.
More problematic are common cases like those below, in which a
verb is marked with more pronominal prefixes than are called for by its
valence.
(6-10) a. ta-mp-ant-kia-k-nak-mpwi
NEG-3 DL A-hear-NIGHT-IRR-3 SG D-talk T
'Those two did not listen to her.'","[294, 295, 296, 297, 298]"
"TENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD263This actually means 'don't have' , so that the postposition kantk- 'with'
used in the corresponding positive forms is lacking with kayak.

'We have money. '
b. ipa tawra kayak
1PL money COP NEG
'We don't have money.'

kantk-n amayak
1SG sickness IX SG with-1SG COP 1SG
'I am sick.'
b. ama tamana
kayak
1SG sickness IX SG COP NEG
'I am not sick.'
kayak is also the response word meaning 'no' .
The pattern of negation through verbal inflection with ta- NEG or
the negative copula forms is the only means of negation in Yimas. All
negation in Yimas is sentential, having the entire clause within the scope
of the negative (but see Section 6.3. 1). There is no phrasal or word
level negative in Yimas, as there is in English with the prefix un- (see
Klima 1964, Payne 1985) . Only verbs can be inflected with the negative
morpheme; there are no negative forms for the true adjectives, such as
kpa- 'big'.
A final point about negation. As should be clear by now from the
long and detailed exposition I have felt bound to provide, negation in
Yimas is a quite complex affair, and one should not be surprised to
learn that this system is now gradually being abandoned. All speakers,
sometimes, and younger speakers (under 30) , commonly, avoid these
complexities by simply using the proclitic ina 'not' before a positive
verb. This proclitic ina is a borrowing from the Tok Pisin negative i no.
ina NEG is most usually encountered in equational sentences, where it
is now the norm for almost all speakers, but any verb can potentially be
negated by the innovation ina NEG instead of the traditional ta- NEG.
The only exception is negated possessive clauses with kayak 'don't have' ;
ina can never replace kayak.
5.2.2.2 Potential Modality
This modal prefix expresses events which are viewed as possible occur­
rences in the normal course of events, but not likely. Perhaps its most
common use is with tense suffixes expressing past tense to indicate events
which almost happened in the past, but did not in fact eventuate. The264BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYpotential modal prefix has the form ant-, but this contracts with third
person prefixes as follows: ant- POT + n- 3SG > anan-, ant- POT +
mpi- 3DL > ampi- , and ant- POT + mpu- 3PL > ampu. The poten­
tial modal prefix triggers the same rules for changes in the pronominal
prefixes as does ta- NEG, as seen in the following:
(5-127) a. ant-ka-tu-r-um
POT-1SG A-kill-PERF-PL
'I almost killed them. '
b. ant-JJa-tpul-c-um
POT-1SG 0-hit-PERF-PL
'They almost hit me.'
except that the general third person prefix pu- of negative verbs is not
used for verbs with ant-.
(5-128) anan-mal
POT 3SG S-die
'He almost died.'
The potential modality indicates events which are viewed by the
speaker as possible events. With future tense or non-perfective aspects,
the meaning is vague as to whether the reading should be the deontic
one ('is permitted/is able to') or the epistemic one ('is possible that'),
much like English can.
(5-129) a. ampu-na-wark-kia-nt-nm

i.e., 'They are able to build a house tomorrow.'

'If I have firewood, I will be able to cook.'
?'If I have firewood, it is possible that I will cook.'
With past tense suffixes, and especially with the perfective aspect suffix
-r, ant- POT is used to indicate events which almost, but did not in
fact, happen.
(5-131) a. ampu-tay-mpi-yawra-t-ak
POT 3PL A-see-SEQ-take-PERF-SG
'They almost found him.'
b. ant-ka-tu-na-nak
POT-1SG A-kill-NR PAST-SG
'I almost killed him yesterday.'
Because of this meaning of potential past events which did not occur,
the potential modal prefix is employed in the formation of counterfactual
adverbial clauses (see Section 7.2.3), in both the apodosis and protasis.

killed it. '
The potential modal prefix is properly used in both the apodosis and
protasis, for both encode potential past events which did not occur.
5.2.2.3 Likely Modality
The likely modal prefix ka- encodes events which are regarded by the
speaker as likely to occur in the normal course of events. The likely
modal prefix does not normally trigger the same changes in the pronom-266BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYinal prefixes as do ta- NEG or ant- POT (although is a rarely observed
option) . It is simply added to an otherwise normally inflected verb.

'We few will kill you. '
ka- LIKE expresses events which are likely to occur, but not regarded
as definite by the speaker. Because of this, ka- cannot co-occur in the
near future with na- DEF, which implies a much stronger expectation
of occurrence. Both may be used with -kia NR FUT but with a subtle
difference in meaning.

(I am quite sure that) you will go tomorrow.'
Because of its meaning of unrealized, but likely events, ka- LIKE
never occurs with past tense suffixes or -r PERF (which are favored
by ant- POT). It is most common with the present and future tenses,
especially the former. With the future tenses it tends to weaken their
force, indicating likely events, but not definite ones (see 5-134a,b). With
the present tense it expresses an action close at hand that the speaker
thinks will probably come to pass (see also examples 5-133a,c).

plural, is realized as ra- when following another prefix. As ka- LIKE
is the only prefix which can precede it, this is the only environment in
what ra- will appear.
Finally, ka- LIKE is completely prohibited from co-occurring with
the irrealis. This is explicable in view of the semantic incompatibility of
the two: the irrealis expresses events the occurrence of which the speaker
expresses no commitment about.
Events which may occur are marked by the modal prefix ant- POT,
while those which should occur are marked by ka- LIKE. This difference
in Yimas is probably best brought out by the following sets of contrastive
examples:
(5-136) a. m-n
yua-n-ti-k-nan
NR DIST-I SG good-I SG-do/feel-IRR-OBL

tomorrow.'
In the first example, the act of helping is a potential response to the
man's good character, but there is no commitment to this, so ant­
POT is proper in the second clause here. However, the act of one
man helping another sets up a reciprocal obligation which within Yi­
mas social customs would be extremely difficult to ignore. Therefore,
the act of helping in the second clause in (5-136b) is a highly likely
��vent, given the conditions of the first clause, so that ka- LIKE is proper
here.

5.2.2 Modality
Modality describes the actuality of an event, whether it is realized or not
(this was termed ""status"" in Foley and Van Valin 1984, 213-8) . This is
covered partially in Yimas by the contrast between the irrealis and the
tense suffixes, and indeed in some languages, modality is viewed largely
as a binary distinction between irrealis and realis. However, within
the irrealis dimension, languages often recognized further distinctions,
whether the action is necessary, likely, or merely possible. Yimas is one
of these languages, and these additional modal distinctions are provided
by a set of modal prefixes: ta- NEG, ant- POT, and ka- LIKE.
5.2.2.1 Negation
The modal prefixes are a particularly complicated area of Yimas gram­
mar, often requiring re-arrangements of the verbal morphology. The
negative prefix ta- is typical in this regard. The basic rule is that the
lowest ranked participant, rather than being realized as the leftmost
prefix, is expressed through a suffix following the tense suffix. In other
words, its position is usurped by the negative prefix, so it appears as
a suffix. As intransitive verbs have only a single prefix, that of the S
argument, they represent the simplest case and for ease of exposition, it
is best to start with them.
Consider first the contrast between the following positive and nega­
tive intransitive verbs with first person S arguments:
(5-98) a. (i)b. (i)ama-wa-t

"6The Verb Theme and Clause
Structure6.1 Yimas as a Polysynthetic Language
In this chapter and the next I will deal with what might be called the
'syntax' of Yimas. I put this word in quotes because to a very great
extent Yimas lacks the features that we take as diagnostic of syntax in
the more familiar languages of Western Europe. Other than the minimal
noun phrase discussed in Section 4 .6, the syntactic landscape of Yimas
strikes a speaker of a western European language as very alien territory
indeed, presenting very few analogues to the syntactic constituents we
have come to expect.
Like many Amerindian languages, Yimas may be described as poly­
synthetic. Boas ( 1911 , 74) defined this feature as follows: ""a large num­
ber of distinct ideas are amalgamated by grammatical processes and
form a single word, without any morphological distinction between the
formal elements in the sentence and the contents of the sentence."" In
other words, a word (especially a verbal word) in a polysynthetic lan­
!!;Uage corresponds in the range of distinct ideas expressed in it to what
is articulated by a sentence in more familiar languages. To see how this
applies to Yimas, consider the following examples (the square brack­
ds indicate the structural level of verb theme, which will be defined
later) :
( 6- 1) a. ka-mpu-[pay-ma-takat ]-.Jla-mpan-m
LIKE-3PL A-first-in-touch-IMP-3PL D-VII SG T
'Let them first put it (body paint) on them inside.'
b. ya-mpu-[nanaiJ-tacay-ckam]-tuk-mpun

'They were showing those very carefully to them.'

'We few got up and quickly started to walk.'
e. na-n-[mampi-taJJ-tal-kulanalJ]
3SG 0-3SG A-again-COM-CAUS-walk
'He made him walk with him again. '
All of these examples constitute single words, yet are translated by
sentences in English, in some cases (6-lc,d) by quite complex sen­
tences. That these are single words is clearly supported by a num­
ber of facts. First, these sequences are fully coherent and are not
interruptible. For example, no word or phrase can come between
kwalca-mpi arise-SEQ and kulanav walk in (6- ld) , in spite of the fact
that, from the English point of view these would seem to be sepa­
rate words. Note that in the English translation, the adverb quickly
occurs between these two verbs; this is not possible in the Yimas
form.
Second, the verbal morphology discussed in detail in Chapter 5 ap­
plies to these verbal forms as a whole, not individually. Note that the
tense suffixes in the above forms occur only once, following the last verb
root. Further, the pronominal affixes which mark the core arguments
have scope over the whole complex. Thus, in (6-lb) the 0 and A argu­
ments are indicated by the initial prefixes and the D argument by the
final suffix. In (6-lc) the A argument is marked by the second prefix
vkl- 3PC A (immediately following ta- NEG), and the 0 argument by
the final suffix - nak 3SG. In the corresponding positive sentence, of
course, both the A and the 0 would be indicated by prefixes. Perhaps
the most striking case is the long example in (6-ld). Here the S argu­
ment is expressed by the initial prefix pavkra- lPC S, and its number is
again referenced by the final suffix -vkt PC, eight morphemes away!
Third, the ordering of morphemes within these complexes is rigid.
For example, in ( 6-la,e) any ordering of morphemes other than that
given will result in ungrammatical forms. In a very few cases alternative
orderings are possible, but with no appreciable difference in meaning.

"416INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSAs with the evidence from the modally inflected verbs, the anomaly
of -nak 3SG 0 illustrates a nominative-accusative bias in this part of
Yimas grammar. Note that, when relativized, S and A participants
of these specific class and number features are coded alike, with 0
-n, while 0 participants are treated differently, requiring - nak. The
following examples make this very clear:
(7-83) a. namarawt [m-na-taw-n-0
mnti]
person I SG NR DIST-DEF-sit-PRES-3SG there
'the person who is sitting there'
b. namarawt [narmaJJ

'the person who hit the woman'
c. namarawt [narmaJJ
m-n-tpul-c-ak]
person I SG woman II SG NR DIST-3SG A-hit-PERF-3SG 0
'the person whom the woman hit'
It is difficult to explain the reason for this form. It cannot be to eliminate
ambiguity, for the obligatory absence of any third person pronominal
prefixes in A relativization versus their presence in 0 relativization is
sufficient to accomplish this. Further this is exactly how disambiguation
is accomplished in the dual and plural which use the same concord suffix
regardless of the participant role of the relativized noun.
(7-84) a. namat

Relativization of the T argument of a ditransitive verb is simplest
if the D participant is first or second person and hence marked by a
pronominal prefix. Then, the concord suffix for the relativized T noun
simply follows the tense suffix.

If the D is third person and thus a suffix, the concord suffix for the
relativized T follows it, causing the D suffix to appear in its non-word­
final form.

Relativization of D participants presents a special problem. The
m- NR DIST stem always occupies one of the verbal pronominal pre­
fix positions potentially usurping the position for the prefix for the T
participant. The pronominal affixes for third person D participants are
suffixes following the tense suffix, and this is the position for the con­
cord suffix marking the class and number features of the noun modified
by the relative clause. Both of these present morphological difficulties
for relativization of D participants, and this is generally avoided in the
language. I have never encountered an example in spontaneous usage,
but in elicitation sessions I have been able to get speakers to produce
examples like the following, although given the context in which they
were obtained, it is probable that they are fairly stilted.

'The boy that the women gave food to is crying in the house.'
The relative clause in (7-87) has no unambiguous concord suffix nor m­
NR DIST. The verbal pronominal suffix in this example does double418INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSduty as both the relative clause concord marker and the affix for a third
person singular D participant. The stem m- NR DIST is completely
prohibited because of ya- V PL T. In fact, the modified noun plus the
relative clause looks like a main clause, and (7-87) is ambiguous between
a construction with a relative clause and one consisting of two conjoined
clauses with the meaning 'The women gave the food to the boy in the
house and he is crying.' What, in fact, can discriminate between these
two are word order constraints. If the first clause is simply one of two
conjoined clauses, then kalakn 'boy' can occur anywhere within it, say
between vaykum 'women' and amtra 'food'. If, however, it is the ex­
ternal modified noun of a relative clause, this is not possible. It must
always occur outside of the relative clause, either before it, as in (7-87),
or after it.
Yimas does not restrict relativization to core arguments only. The
language allows relative clauses to be formed by relativizing locationals
(and temporals, as well, but these will be discussed in Section 7.2.3).
When a locational is relativized, the clause describes the place at which
an event occurs, but locative relative clauses contrast with those formed
for core arguments in that they never permit a true head noun, al­
though a locational word or deictic may be present, as following exam­
ples illustrate:

'up there where they cut their skin'
The relative clause in the (a) example can only be construed as modify­
ing mnti 'there', but the class-number concord marker on the verb is - a
IX SG. This is the typical class-number marker for referring to places or
areas and may reflect a now lost noun referring to this concept (much
as - mpwi 'talk' and - nti 'act' probably do) . This may be related to
the prefix ta- found on the other locational deictics ta-k 'here' and ta-n
'there' or even more likely to the interrogative stem -vka 'where', both
of which end in -a and on phonological grounds are plausible members
of class IX. In any case, the relative clause is marked as modifying aFINITE NOMINALIZATIONS419class IX singular noun which clearly cannot be the locational deictic.
Rather we must assume some obligatorily missing noun of this class and
number specification which, in turn, is in apposition to the deictic. Sim­
ilar remarks apply to ( 7-88b), with the locational word mawn 'above'.
Sometimes there is not even a deictic or locational word to act as a stand
in head for a locative relative clause; they simply occur on their own as
in (7-89):

Negative finite relative clauses are formed in the same way that
tensed clauses generally are negated, with the verbal prefix ta- NEG
(this obligatorily replaces m- NR DIST). In relative clauses, however,
ta- creates some problems because the morphological effect of negation
on a verb is very much like that of relativization: both require par­
ticipants normally coded by pronominal prefixes to appear as suffixes.
This can result in negative relative clauses being ambiguous (note that
the same result obtains with negation by -kakan 'without' used with
non-finite relative clauses).

'the person that did
not hit the woman.'
The suffix -nak 3SG 0 could be either the result of negation or relative
clause formation. If the latter, it would identify the relativized noun as
in 0 function and thus require the first of the two possible readings. This
is, in fact, the preferred reading. If - nak 3SG 0 derives from negation,
then no conclusions are possible concerning the role of the relativized
noun and the relative clause is therefore compatible with a reading of it
being the A participant (the seeond meaning above). The only way to{}420INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSforce a reading of the A as being the relativized noun is not to code the
0 by a verbal affix at all.

Here the bivalent verb tpul- 'hit' is formally intransitive, with just a
single participant coded by pu- . . .-0. The fact that the concord suffix on
the verb is 0 rather than - nak indicates that the relativized noun must
be A. Hence, this example is not ambiguous.
The placement of a relative clause (finite or non-finite) with respect
to its 'head' noun is free. It can precede the 'head' noun,

ative clauses normally function to provide definite descriptions for an en­
tity just being introduced in order to help the hearer identify it. To pro­
vide the definite description but omit the noun to which it applies is prag­
matically very odd and requires quite a marked context to be acceptable.
Example (7-95) belongs in a narrative context discussing crocodiles,
where the entity described by the relative clause is already well es­
tablished. The relative clause then functions contrastively, to select a
particular set of crocodiles out of the class which is already the topic.
The freedom of movement of relative clauses and their very weak
links to their 'head' nouns is fully in keeping with the analysis adopted
here that they are independent nominals in their own right, but appo­
sitionally linked to their head. Unlike other nominals, though, finite rel­
ative clauses are full clauses and partake of the grammatical features of
clauses. As discussed in Section 6.5, Yimas clauses are very loosely struc­
tured, with nominals (core and oblique) occurring in any order with re­
spect to the verb. Structurally, a Yimas clause is flat, with the verb and
nominal clauses all on the same level, as first order branches of S. Rel­
ative clauses have the same basic structure, and are just as free in their
word order possibilities. Thus, (7-96a,b) are both fully grammatical.

Relative clauses can assume any function in the main clause: core
arguments, obliques, or even constituents of possessive NPs. Most com­
monly they are linked to 'head' nouns in these functions and thus assume
the same functions, although the 'heads' can be missing, with the rela­
tive clauses bearing these functions on their own. Examples of relative

Note that in both of these examples, the relative clause follows the non­
finite verb ( it is possible for them to precede ) .
The above facts clearly demonstrate that finite relative clauses have
all the syntactic features and privileges of nouns, including class and
number, but at the same time remain full finite clauses, with tense real­
ized on the verb. They must be analyzed in the most basic terms as an
N realized as a clause. There are two morphological exponents of these
nominal features-m- NR DIST and the final concord suffixes-and so
the question arises as to which of these is the head of the construction,
i.e., that morpheme which actually makes the sentential constituent into
a noun phrase. This would be difficult to decide if it was not for one
small piece of evidence, and that is the concord suffix - nak 3SG 0. This
actually codes the function of the relativized noun, which is a clause­
internal constituent, not that of any constituent in the main clause.
Thus, its behavior is like that of a verbal pronominal affix within the
relative clause. This leaves m- NR. DIST to assume the function of theINTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS424head of the relative clause, and suggests a more formal structure like the
following:
(7-99)NP---- ---N
S
I
/ ""'-.
mX
PRONR DIST--This structure is anomalous in having its head on the left, because Vi­
mas otherwise is a consistent head to the right language. However, this
discrepancy must be faced with the deictics generally; consider the fol­
lowing deictic forms for class I SG:
na-n
m-n
(7-100) na-k
I SG-FR DIST
NR DIST-I SG
I SG-PROX
'that near you'
'that yonder'
'this'
Regardless of whether we choose the concord suffix or the deictic stem
as the head in these forms, at least one form will be anomalous. Sticking
to the majority head to the right pattern of Yimas, we can analyze the
proximal and far deictic forms as consisting of modifier + head, with the
head being the deictic stem. Applying this then to the near distal form,
we identify m- NR DIST as its head. This is unusual because the head
is on the left, but it does independently vindicate the structure (7-100)
suggested for relative clauses.
The stem m- NR DIST is not equivalent to the head noun of an
English relative clause such as the man who killed the crocodile. It is
equivalent rather to the main clause noun to which the relative clause
as a whole is paratactically linked.
Consider the structure of example (7-97a) , which is diagrammed
below in (7-101). Because m- is a form bound to the verb, noun ar­
guments of the relative clause occur before it, represented by the line
branching from the S of the relative clause and crossing over the ver­
tical line from the N of the relative clause. The concord suffix on the
verb of the relative clause marks the class and number (and the par­
ticipant role) of the relativized noun. These features are transferred
to m- NR DIST, much as - m on English who-m identifies that the
relativized noun is an object. Since m- NR DIST is the head of the
noun phrase, these features are also those of the noun phrase as a
whole. These finally are matched up to the features of the noun kaywi
'girl' which is thereby established as the noun modified by the relative
clause.","[431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"

These two causative constructions for adjectival verb roots are syn­
onymous. All speakers queried have explicitly stated this and have been
unable to find any context which specifically favors one or the other. It
should be pointed out, however, that the former construction, i.e., direct
derivation from the root without ti-, is much more common and is fa­
vored by all speakers. The latter construction, i.e., causative derivation
from a ti- derived inchoative, is only spontaneously encountered when
the nominalized verb is not incorporated, as in (6-47).
A final point about syntactic causatives concerns the animacy of the
causer. Whenever the causer is animate, a causative construction must
be used, with the causer functioning as the A participant. However,
when the causer is an inanimate object or force, far more common and
natural is its appearance as an oblique nominal, with the verb in question300THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREbeing a monovalent inchoative predicate. Compare the following two
examples ( also note ( 6-42c ) and ( 6-45c )) .

'The roof got blackened from the smoke.'
The Yimas alternation is very much parallel to that operative in English,
as indicated in the corresponding English translations. The causative
construction with the causing force functioning as A, attributes a strong,
almost willful, responsibility to the cause in solely bringing about the
effect of the roof's blackening. This is in keeping with the coding of
the cause as A. On the other hand, the inchoative construction, in
which the causing force appears as an oblique, has a somewhat weaker
implication. It declares that the roof turned black, and that the reason
for that was the smoke, but it does not attribute such a strong and direct
responsibility to it, nor does it imply that it was the sole cause. Another
example of this type of alternation follows:

6.2.3.2 Possessor Raising
Possessor raising is a common valence increasing process in Yimas, ap­
plicable to both monovalent and bivalent verbs. In possessor promotion
constructions, the animate possessor of an absolutive core argument ( S
or 0 participant ) is realized on its own as a core argument of the verb.
It is always coded by a D participant affix. Other than this D pronomi­
nal affix, there is no overt indication on the verb; thus, unlike the otherSTEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES301valence altering options, there is no specific morpheme to indicate a pos­
sessor raising derivation. Possessor raising also diverges from these other
constructions in applying at the level of the verb theme, Le., affecting
the verb as a whole. This is the result of the absence of any overt deriva­
tional morphology signaling possessor raising. Because of this, there is
no motivation for ascribing the derivation to any one verb stem in the
verb theme. The other valence altering devices normally derive verbal
stems from roots, which in turn can be combined to form a complex verb
theme, although, as we have seen earlier and will see again below, there
are examples of these applying at the level of the verb theme as well.
Possessor raising is basically restricted to body parts. When posses­
sor raising applies to a monovalent verb, the S argument is realized by
an S /0 prefix form and the animate possessor by the D affix.

will be written as nawkwan and kawkawpwi, respectively. This seems
necessary because R spreading in these cases produces a segment w
rather than just rounding the vowel. Finally, initial w as a result of
initial semivowel formation (2-10) will also be orthographically repre­
sented; thus jut/ 'night' becomes orthographic wut. This will not be
done with initial y resulting from the same rule. This difference in or­
thographic convention reflects the more common pronunciation.
Consonants contrast with vowels in the orthography in that their
writing conventions approach their surface phonetic realizations more
closely. This was already mentioned with the case of final stops following
nasals. Any underlying consonant which undergoes a phonological rule
of Section 2.3, such as palatalization (2-3) or liquid strengthening (2-4, 25), will be written as the derived segment, not the underlying one. Thus
jtaJ]kway + takal + k/ 'look after' will be written as tal]kwaycakalk
(palatalization) , fapur/ 'green skink' as aput (final liquid strengthen­
ing) , and /tal + na + k/ 'hold it' as tatJlak (palatalization plus prenasal
liquid strengthening).
�---3Word C lassesYimas has only two major, open classes of words, nouns and verbs; all
other classes are small and closed. The inventory of the closed classes is
the following:
pronouns
deictics
conjunctions
interjectionsadjectives
quantifiers
locationals
temporalsWe can distinguish these word classes by a variety of criteria; both se­
mantic and formal. Often the semantic content of a word class will
determine its range of morphological possibilities. For example, nouns
commonly denote objects. Hence number, the morphological category
for the expression of multiple tokens of an object, and case, the category
which indicates the role an object plays in a given event, are general
inflectional possibilities for nouns. Verbs, on the other hand, denote
states or events. A common morphological category for them is tense,
which expresses the time at which the event occurs. But not all inflec­
tional categories can be explained so straightforwardly: Yimas verbs are
assigned to just one word class, but the language has a rich system of
derivational morphology by which verbs are derived into nouns and ad­
jectives. Adjectives in turn may be derived into adverbs and verbs. No
other parts of speech are derivable. Some choices are just an arbitrary
feature of a particular language. For example, in Yimas number is an in­
flectional category of verbs as well as nouns. Consequently, word classes
cannot be defined in terms of semantic content alone, but we must use
in their definitions a combination of semantic content, morphological
possibilities, and syntactic behavior. This is the procedure that I will
follow in defining each of the Yimas word classes in the sections that
follow.
8!190WORD CLASSES3.1 Nouns
Nouns are the word class which provides an inventory of the objects
of interest in the world (or imagination) of the speakers of a language.
Nouns are employed in discourse to introduce props, entities, and partic­
ipants relevant to the progression of the discourse. They accomplish this
because by the conventions of the language they are symbols associated
with their referents, the real world or imaginary objects which are called
into mind when the noun is uttered in discourse.
The natural world, as well as the human creations of the social and
cultural worlds, presents a vast array of entities which may be con­
ventionally expressed by nouns. Each language group, according to its
interests, its ecological niche, its social and cultural forms, selects from
this range and codes a subset of it in its system of nouns. However, the
system of nouns is still always large and is invariably the largest word
class in a language. This is undoubtedly true of Yimas, in which the set
of nouns is much larger than the next largest word class, verbs.
Because nouns are typically employed in discourse to introduce or
mention props or participants, they are associated with syntactic func­
tions which describe these participants or express their roles. Nouns fill
the functions of grammatical relations such as subject and object and are
associated with the category of case, which expresses the syntactic roles
of participants. For example, Yimas has a single case marker, an oblique
case suffix - n ""' - nan, which indicates locations, times or instruments
(see Section 4.2). This is a common inflection for noun stems:
(3-1) nam-n
tmat-jlan
wanwa-n
rna
house-OBL
other sun-OBL
knife-OBL
'with a knife'
'on another day'
'in the house'
Nouns also function as the subject and object of a verb. Nouns in
these functions are not inflected for case, but do agree in person and
number with the verb. Their agreement is indicated by a set of verb
prefixes (0 indicates the object of a transitive verb and A, its subject;
see Section 5.1.1).

The word order of the nouns in Yimas is free, so order does not sig­
nal their syntactic functions as it does in English (compare the English
translations of the above examples). Rather this is indicated by the pre-91NOUNSfixes t o the verb. The sequence o f prefixes in (3-2a) pu-n- indicates a
singular subject and a plural object, so the plural noun in the sentence
namat 'men' is the subject, and the singular noun narmav 'woman' is
the object. The opposite situation obtains in (3-2b) where the prefix
sequence na-mpu- indicates a singular object and a plural subject.
The morphology of nouns will be treated in greater detail in Chapter
4, so I will only mention here some basic morphological defining char­
acteristics. All nouns except for proper names are inflected for three
numbers-singular, dual and plural-and are assigned to a single noun
class. It is this last feature which distinguishes nouns from adjectives
or deictics. Adjectives and deictics vary over the whole range of noun
classes, co-occurring with all possible number/class suffixes. Nouns dif­
fer in being uniquely assigned to a class and taking the number/ class
suffixes specific to that class. Contrast the adjective ma 'other', occur­
ring with a number of different number/class suffixes, with the class VI
noun kav 'shell':

many common nouns have suppletive forms to mark number, i.e., the
singular and plural forms have different stems (in all these cases the dual
form is derived regularly from the singular stem) . This generally applies
to nouns referring to human beings, some animals and other important
objects. Consider the following small sample:

two possible inflections, the number/class markers and the oblique case
suffix -n ,...., - nan . The morphology of nouns is exclusively suffixal, while
that of verbs is both prefixal and suffixal. Nouns are inherently assigned
to a given class and are marked for number by a set of number suffixes
which vary for class.

yakiaura-3.2 Verbs
Verbs contrast with nouns in that they are the word class which denote
events or states. While objects, especially those in the natural world,
exist in their own right, this is not true of events or states. These only
manifest themselves by virtue of some object or objects undergoing or
performing them. The set of verbs in a language may be viewed as a
script outlining the various modes in which objects denoted by the set
of nouns may interact.
Because verbs function as the script of a language, it is they which
lay out the basic plot of a discourse. Verbs prototypically fill the syntac­
tic/semantic function of the predicate of the clause, which denotes theADJECTIVES93nature of the state or event participated in by a set of objects referred
to by the nouns in the clause. Thus, the verb hit functioning in John hit
Peter tells us the manner in which John and Peter interacted. Verbs like
hit indicating a transaction between two or more objects are transitive.
Other verbs function as predicates denoting an event or state performed
or undergone by some object; these are intransitive verbs, and exam­
ples are run as in John ran in the race, or sleep as in John slept in the
barn.
The morphology of verbs will be treated in detail in Chapters 5 and
6, so I will only discuss some basic defining features here. The morpho­
logical feature most characteristic of verbs, and the only obligatory one,
is tense. All finite verbs must be inflected for tense, and non-finite verbs
must have a suffix -ru in the normal inflectional position for tense. No
other part of speech is ever inflected for tense, so it can be regarded as
a necessary and sufficient condition on the word class verb.
A second defining characteristic of verbs is that only they can occur
with the modal prefixes, such as ta- NEG, ant- POT and ka- LIKELY.
These are not necessary inflections on a verb, as most verbs are un­
marked for modality. But the potential occurrence of one of these pre­
fixes on a word always identifies it as a verb, for no other word class is
inflectable for modality.
A third morphological characteristic of verbs is the presence of pre­
fixes to indicate the person, number, and noun class of core nominal ar­
guments, i.e., subject, object, and indirect object. I have already pointed
out how nouns are uniquely assigned to noun classes and inflected for
number by suffixes, varying allomorphically according to noun class.
Verbs parallel this variation for noun class and number by indicating
these features for the nouns functioning as their core arguments, but do
so by means of prefixes. Examples of such verbal prefixes corresponding
to the noun suffixes were presented at the end of Section 3.2.
3.3 Adjectives
Adjectives are the word class that expresses a state, quality, or defining
characteristic of some object. As such, they most commonly function
syntactically as the modifier of some noun in a noun phrase. Some
languages seem to have no word class of adjectives at a.ll, assigning all
words denoting states or qualities of objects to the word classes verb or
noun (Dixon 1977). Other languages have a very small and restricted
class of adjectives. Yimas is one of these. There are only three true
unambiguous examples of adjectives in the language. They are kpa 'big',
yua 'good', and ma 'other'. These are distinguished from other Yimas
words denoting qualities of objects in that they are uninflected for the94WORO CLASSESverbal category tense and may occur with a following noun in a tightly
knit noun phrase (see Section 4.6).
(3-3) a. kpa nam
b. * nam kpa
house big
big house
'a big house'
No other word can occur between the adjective and the head noun. If this
should occur, the adjective must then be suffixed with a number class
suffix agreeing in these features with the modified noun. Its position is
now free and can occur on either side of the noun.
(3-4) a. kpa-nm
nam
big-house SG house
'a big house'
b. nam kpa-nm
house big-house SG
'a big house'
In fact, the inflected adjective need not even adjoin the noun, but may
occur anywhere in the clause.
(3-5) ama-na
nam
lSG-POSS house SG
ant-ka-na-war-kiant-nm
kpa-nm
POT-lSG A-DEF-build-NR FUT-house SG big-house SG
'Tomorrow I will be able to build my big house.'
Other words denoting qualities are morphologically verbs. These
occur with the suffix -k, the tense suffix for irrealis (IRR) . This suffix
is normally used to remove the action denoted by the verb from the
continuum in real time and thus mark it as timeless. It is therefore
used for events in the legendary past, unrealized events in the future
whose time of occurrence cannot be fixed, and states whose duration
cannot be bound (see Section 5.2. 1 . 1 ) . It is this last meaning which
accounts for its use with words denoting qualities. These adjectival-like
verbs suffixed with - k also require a number/class suffix, agreeing in
these features with a modified noun. As such they may occur on either
side of the noun, or may not even adjoin it. These tensed adjectival
verbs never occur in the construction characteristic of true adjectives,
i.e., immediately preceding the head noun in a close-knit noun phrase
without the number/ class suffixes. Examples of these adjectival verbs
follow:
(3-6) a. apak tukut-k-nmau
sister heavy-IRR-11 SG
'a fat sister'ADJECTIVES95b. urkpwica-k-n
numpran
black-IRR-III SG pig III SG
'a black pig'
*
c. urkpwica numpran
black
pig III SG
The adjectival verbs comprise the largest class of words denoting qual­
ities in Yimas. Besides the first stems already illustrated, we have the
following non-exhaustive list:
'white'
'long'
'short'
'hard/strong'
'light'
'new'
'straight'yarackaw!Jkraparmpakalcwal]lakantmakrat!Jk-'sharp'
'whole'
'hollow'
'stubborn'
'empty, clear'
'dry'wapimuntaurmpwi­
ara!Jalca­
kamtakacJlaA further indication that these so-called adjectival verbs are really
verbs shows up in the formation of inchoatives, expressing changes of
state. The adjectival verbs can do this directly, by changing the tense
inflection to one within the real temporal continuum, and changing the
number/ class suffixes to the more typically verbal number/class prefixes
(S indicates the subject of an intransitive verb).
(3-7) a. na-t!Jknt-t
II SG S-become heavy-PERF
'She got fat.'
p-urkpwica-t
b. narm
skin VII SG VII SG S-blacken-PERF
' (My) skin darkened.'
The examples in (3-7) clearly indicate that these stems in their basic
meaning are process verbs; they only assume the stative meaning by
virtue by the IRR suffix -k, which stipulates that the event is unbounded
in time.
The true adjectives may not form inchoatives in this fashion. Rather
they must occur with the verb ti- 'do, become, feel', which carries the
tense suffix. The adjective may occur as a separate word or may be
incorporated into the verb, but in both cases it must co-occur with the
proper number/class suffix for the subject of the verb.

These constructions are parallel to the possessor raising constructions
with body parts in that the participant primarily affected by the action
is the animate possessor, coded by the D affix, not the possessed object
coded by the T affix. Further, there is a strong implication that the effect
will be negative (malefactive). This is because in these constructions,
the relationship between the possessor and possessed is terminated by
the action of the verb, with resultant loss or stress on the part of the
possessor. The background context for all the examples above drawn
from texts supports this. The (a) example concerns a scouting party
up in the mountains, with a limited food supply, which was used up by
members of another tribe, resulting in their being hungry. In the (b) ex­
ample, the speaker's basket and its contents of betelnut were taken from
him, so that he was without betelnut. In (c) the example comes from
a traditional legend concerning a village with a magic totemic crocodile
which endowed them with great strength. Here, the speakers plan to
steal it, to get this strength for themselves, but importantly resulting
in the loss of this strength for the present possessors of the crocodile.
Finally, the (d) example has a transparent negative effect on the speaker
and is self-explanatory.
The other side of this construction, in which positive benefits accrue
to the possessor, is the benefactive use of tav- COM. This is actually
j ust the mirror image of the previous usage, but it is disguised at first by
the structure of English and the English translations. In the benefactive
usage, an actor performs an act which results in the establishment of a
possessive relationship between an object and a possessor, with resultant
benefit to the possessor. Consider these examples:
k-ka-tau-yawra-t-akn

7.1.3 Purpose Clauses
Purpose clauses share a number of the grammatical properties of com­
plements, but contrast with the latter in that they never function as a
core argument of the matrix verb. Rather, they function somewhat like
oblique constituents of the matrix verb, expressing the intended goal of
the action of the matrix verb. Purpose clauses are like complements in
that they are non-finite: they never occur with pronominal agreement
affixes or true tense suffixes (only the irrealis suffix) . Purpose clauses are
always controlled: the A or S of a purpose clause can never be overtly
expressed and is always coreferential with a human core argument of the
matrix verb. Normally this is the S or A participant, but if the verb has
more than one human participant, it is possible for the 0 or D to be the
controller. ( See example ( 7-61c) below. ) The verb in a purpose clause
is marked by the irrealis suffix -k ""' -vk, as in these examples:
( 7-61 ) a. rna IJarlJ
wa!Jkia
awl-k
other 1 day removed rafters IX PL get-IRR
ipa-wa-ntut
1PL S-go-RM PAST
'Next day we went to get (wood for) rafters.'

kumpwi
woman II PL NR DIST-1SG 0-throw-PERF-3PL child I PL
taiJkway-cakal-k
VIS-grasp-IRR
'It was the women who sent me to look after the children.'
In ( 7-61a,b) the matrix verbs are monovalent verbs of motion with only
an S participant, which is then the controller of the purpose clause. NoteNON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS403further the presence of -kia in both the matrix verb and that of the pur­
pose clause. Its presence on both verbs is obligatory. True complements
diverge here in prohibiting -kia. Example (7-61c) has a bivalent main
verb with two human arguments, an A, vaykum 'women', and an 0, va­
lSG 0. The controller of the purpose clause must be the 0 participant:
witness the above translation. (7-61c) cannot have A control (*'it was
the women who sent me so that they could look after the children').
The irrealis suffix -k ,...., -vk is the general and common marker of
purpose clauses, but in one specific context there is an alternative to it.
If the act denoted by the purpose clause is to be carried out directly and
immediately as the result of a directive speech act, such as a request or
an order, then the marker for a complement of speech - mpwi 'talk' plus
the immediate aspect clitic mpan IMM may be used. Compare (7-62)
with (7-61c) above:
(7-62) !Jaykum
m-IJa-wampak-c-um
kumpwi
woman II PL NR DIST-lSG 0-throw-PERF-3PL child I PL
ta!Jkway-cakal-cu-mpwi mpan
IMM
VIS-grasp-NFN-talk
'It was the women who sent me to look after the children.'
Examples (7-61c) and (7-62) are very close in structure and meaning.
They structurally contrast in that (7-61c) has the irrealis suffix -k ,...., -vk
while (7-62) has the form of a complement with -ru NFN plus - mpwi
'talk' and the clitic mpan IMM. The meaning difference is that (7-62)
requires an immediately prior verbal order or request to someone that
they look after the children. This is not the case in (7-6lc); although
this scenario is possible, others are also, such as an arrangement made
days earlier or a pre-established custom that one does regularly. It
needs to be noted that not all speakers make this contrast. For some
speakers the contrast is one of immediacy; for them purpose clauses in
-mpwi mpan need to follow directly from the action of the matrix verb.
Other speakers seem to use the two ways of forming purpose clauses
interchangeably. And even some speakers who make it in some contexts
do not make it in others. It appears to be a semantic distinction well on
its way to being lost.
7.1.4 Non-Finite Relative Clauses
Yimas has two types of constructions corresponding to English relative
clauses. A relative clause is a clause-level construction (or more formally,
an S) which modifies a noun, such as the dog [which chased the cat] , in
which the relative clause which chased the cat modifies the noun dog ,
generally called the head of the relative clause. This relative clause404INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSis embedded as a constituent within the whole noun phrase, so that
the constituent structure is [the dog [which chased the cat]] . Both of
the Yimas relative clause types differ from English relative clauses in
that they are never embedded, but are simply nominalized forms of
verbs appositionally linked to a noun they modify, their 'head noun',
rather like juxtaposed possessive nominals. The two types of relative
clauses in Yimas contrast as to whether they are tensed or not. Non­
finite relative clauses are prohibited from occurring with tense suffixes
and instead have - ru NFN plus one of the set of suffixes which mark
agentive nominalizations (for head nouns referring to humans) or one
of the possessive/adjectival concord suffixes (for non-humans). Finite
relative clauses, which will be discussed in detail in Section 7.2.1, are
formed with or without the stem m- NR DIST, but require a true tense
suffix. This difference correlates closely with a meaning difference. Non­
finite relative clauses denote traits or characteristic actions of the noun
modified, while finite relative clauses denote states which hold or actions
which occur within the time frame denoted by the tense suffix on their
verbs. Consider this contrast in the following examples:
(7-63) a. namarawt [awt pampay-kulan-t-awt]
person I SG fire KIN-walk-NFN-M SG
'the person who tends the fire' (as his job)
b. namarawt [awt m-na-pampay-kulana:u]
person I SG fire NR DIST-DEF-KIN-walk
'the person who is tending the fire' (right now, others may
do so at other times)
The glosses in (7-63) clearly bring out the meaning contrast between the
non-finite (7-63a) and the finite (7-63b) relative clauses. The non-finite
relative clause expresses a long duration characteristic action, hence the
reading of the action as a job, while the finite relative clause denotes
the action as occurring within the time frame of the tense suffix, 'right
now', as the tense in (7-63b) is present imperfective. A similar contrast
can be found with states.
(7-64) a. namarawt [tamana
ti-r-awt]
na-mal
person I SG sickness IX SG feel-NFN-M SG 3SG S-die
'The person who was always sick died.'
b. namarawt [tamana
kantk-n] na-mal
person I SG sickness IX SG with-I SG 3SG S-die
'The sick person died.'
The non-finite relative clause in (7-64a) denotes a typical characteristic
state. The copula anak COP 3SG has been deleted in (7-64b), leaving
just the postpositional phrase inflected with the concord suffix - n I SGNON-FINITE N OMINALIZATIONS405as the finite relative clause (the copula could be inserted, but it is better
to omit it). Again, the finite relative clause is bounded in time, denoting
a temporary, transitory state of illness.
The syntax of non-finite and finite relative clauses is nearly identical
and because the latter are the more common type, I will discuss the
syntax of relative clauses in detail in Section 7.2.1. The one significant
difference between the two types is in the range of core argument posi­
tions which are relativizable (Keenan and Comrie 1977). The relativized
noun is that obligatorily missing argument of the relative clause which
must be coreferential with the noun modified, the 'head'. Any core ar­
guments plus locationals and temporals are relativizable with a finite
relative clause, but the relativized nouns in non-finite relative clauses
are restricted to S or A arguments. This is readily explicable, because
non-finite relative clauses are nothing but agentive nominalizations in
apposition to some nominal (the 'head noun'). Hence the noun which
they relativize must belong to the same general class as agentive nom­
inalizations, i.e., either S or A. Interestingly, as ( 7-65c) shows, it is
possible to use a non-finite relative clause to relativize a nominal which
is a non-agentive S. Examples of non-finite relative clause are provided
below:
(7-65) a. m-ukt

c. mukawu yampara-t-uu
post X SG stand-NFN-X SG
ku-ka-pay-pu-t
X SG 0-lSG A-carry-away-PERF
'I took the post for standing up.'
A slight morphological peculiarity of non-finite relative clauses (one
they share with non-finite oblique clauses to be discussed in the next406INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSsection) concerns singular class III and V nouns functioning as 'heads'.
Instead of the expected concord suffix -n III/V SG in this case, what
is actually found is the agentive nominalization suffix - awt M SG, as in
this example:
(7-66) kakam
[awt yara-t-awt]
tree (sp) V SG fire pick up-NFN-M SG
'a (piece of kakam) wood for picking up fire'
Other inanimate nouns are regular, in that the proper concord suffixes
are used.
(7-67) awruk
[awt yara-t-u!J]
torch X SG fire pick up-NFN-X SG
'a torch for picking up fire'
In addition to the positive non-finite relative clauses exemplified thus
far, Yimas also possesses negative non-finite relative clauses, which ex­
press the lack of a state or characteristic action. These are formed with
the postposition - kakan 'without' which behaves morphologically like the
attributive kantk- 'with'. (See example (7-64b)), except that it uses the
agentive nominalization suffixes for human 'head' nouns. There is even
a further exception to this last generalization: for the singular of classes
I, III, and V, -kakan actually uses a zero morpheme, rather than either
the expected - awt M SG or - n I, III, V SG.) Consider these examples:
(7-68) a. wik
mpa-n [yaki
am-kakan-mat]
week V SG one-V SG tobacco eat-without-M PL
na-kay-caw-ntut

"5.2.1.5.2 The Remote Future. The remote future covers the time span
from the day after tomorrow on into the indefinite future, where it ul­
timately merges with the irrealis in the hazy mists of unknown future
time. Of course any event within this time span may be expressed in
either the remote future or the irrealis, with the typical difference that
the remote future binds the speaker to the belief that the event will in
fact occur, while the irrealis does not.
As with the boundary between the near and far past, the transition
between near and remote future is not sharp. The basic problem con­
cerns the status of tomorrow night. Given the traditional reckoning of
the day from sunset to sunset, one speaking at noon about an event
happening tomorrow night should use the temporal urak1'1) wut '2 days
removed night' and the remote future tense, for this event is actually
occurring on the day after tomorrow. This is the most common usage in
Yimas. But an alternative in talking about events expected tomorrow
night is to use varv wut ' 1 day removed night' with the remote future
tense. Still another an alternative is to use ma wut other night 'next
night' plus the remote future (this is ambiguous, but a likely interpre­
tation is as 'tomorrow night'). To specify an event occurring at night
any time within the time span of the remote future, the suffix -kia in
its meaning of night time is used in combination with the remote future
tense suffix.
The remote future tense suffix is -kr. The final /r/ becomes t in
word final position by rule (2-4), final r strengthening, and disappears
before suffixes beginning in /r/. Examples of the remote future follow:
mpa-nan Mosbi-J1an
(5-93) a. tmal
sun/day V SG one-OBL Moresby-OBL
ama-pay-kia-kt
1SG S-lie-NIGHT-RM FUT
'I will sleep one night in Moresby.'",[264]
"LOCATIONALS107Examples of these locational postpositions are given below:
pawmpn
'underneath' (trees)
'at the bottom, below' u rnkun
mawn
'above, at the top'
akpJlan
'behind'
wampuJlan
'in front of'
wampuun < wampu!J 'heart' + -n OBL
'inside'
tapukapn < tapukap 'outside' + -n OBL
'outside'
'outside' + -n OBL
'at the side of'
ayukn
< ayuk
Some of these are transparently derived from nouns by affixing the
oblique suffix. A few other locational words are still nouns because
they can be pluralized. Examples are kcpn 'space underneath a house',
PL: kcpnkat 'the spaces underneath houses'; and mawvkwat 'the other
side', PL: mawvkwara 'the spaces on or at the sides of a dwelling or
object'.
Although these looational postpositions most commonly occur in
postpositional phrases, they may also be used as free locationals. In
this sense, they are like English prepositions, as in John slept inside
versus John slept inside the house. So compare the following examples:
(3-27) a. akru
yampauk-n
mawn k-na-taw-n
frog VI SG head VI SG-OBL above VI SG-DEF-sit-PRES
' The frog is on top of (his) head.'
b. akru
mawn k-na-taw-n
frog VI SG above VI SG 8-DEF-sit-PRES
'The frog is on top.'
In the second example, the location which the frog is above is left unspec­
ified. It is either the position of some object inferred from the context
or may be taken to be the position of the speech event itself or some
event reported in the discourse.
Yimas has four other postpositions which may perhaps be treated
here and squeezed into the class of locationals, although they contrast
from those postpositions treated thus far in some important respects.
These postpositions are
nampan
'toward, for, because of'
nampayn

' with, together'
These grammatical postpositions contrast with the locational postpo­
Hitions in that the preceding noun is never marked with the oblique
caHe suffix. Hence, these grammatical postpositions function like case108WORD CLASSESmarkers themselves, and this explains why they have more abstract re­
lational meanings in contrast to the concrete locational meanings of the
locational postpositions. Besides being postpositions, another feature
shared by members of both types is their ability to become specified
through prefixes to the verb. When this happens with a locational post­
position, the associated noun remains oblique, but with a grammatical
postposition, it becomes a core argument cross-referenced by a verbal
agreement prefix. Consider the following examples:
(3-28) a. panmal
numpk-n
mawn
man I SG mountain V SG-OBL above
na-na-taw-n
3SG S-DEF-sit-PRES
'The man is on top of the mountain.'
b. panmal
numpk-n
na-na-wi-caw-n
man-I SG mountain V SG-OBL 3SG 8-DEF-above-sit-PRES
'The man is on top on the mountain.'
(3-29) a. panmal IJaykum
kantk na-na-wa-n
man I SG woman-11 PL with 3SG-DEF-go-PRES
'The man is going with the women.'
b. panmal IJaykum
pu-na-taiJ-wa-n
man I SG woman II PL 3PL 0-3SG A-DEF-COM-go-PRES
'The man is going with the women.'
In (3-28a) the oblique noun numpuk-n 'mountain' is followed by the
postposition, mawn 'above', while in (3-28b) the oblique noun occurs
by itself, and the notion of 'above' is expressed by the verbal elevational
prefix wi- 'above', which triggers palatization of the following /t/. (For
a detailed discussion of elevational prefixes, see Section 6.3.3.) Sentences
(3-28) (a) and (b) are not perfectly synonymous in all senses. (3-28a)
would normally be taken to mean 'the man is at the top of the mountain'.
Although the reading 'the man is above (us, where the speech act occurs)
on the mountain' is possible, it is definitely not preferred. (3-28b) has
the exact opposite ranking of preferred readings. It would normally
be taken to mean 'the man is above (us, where the speech act occurs)
somewhere on the mountain'. The reading 'the man is at the top of the
mountain' could only be a special case of the former reading, a discourse­
based inference. Thus, the structural difference between a locational
postposition and a verbal elevational prefix reflects a difference in the
preferential readings of the scope of ' above'. As a locational postposition,
it is primarily taken as a modifier of its oblique head noun, while as
a verbal elevational prefix, it is taken as a modifier of the verb and,TEMPORALS109more widely, the speech act. Note that this same contrast is carried in
English by the choice of the prepositions of versus on (see the English
translations of ( 3-28a, b)).
The examples (3-29a, b) are different in two respects. The noun
vaykum 'women' is not case marked by the oblique suffix, but is directly
followed by the postposition kantk 'with'. When the concept of 'with'
is expressed by the comitative verbal prefix tav-, naykum is necessar­
ily a core argument. This is demonstrated by its corresponding verbal
prefix pu-, which agrees with the noun in terms of number/class fea­
tures. (For a detailed discussion of the notion of core arguments and the
function of valence-increasing verbal affixes like tav- COM, see Section
6.2.3.3. These two examples also contrast with the previous two in that
they are absolutely synonymous. As far as can be determined, there
is no difference in sense whatsoever between (3-29) (a) and (b) . There
are pragmatic differences, however, concerning the contrastiveness of
vaykum 'women' (see Section 5.1.6).
In their true postpositional use, all four grammatical postpositions
require human (or at least higher animate) nouns or pronouns as their
objects. kantk has another adjectival-like use to express possession and
then is often found with inanimate object nouns, but that is not of
concern here (see Section 4.5) . nampan, navkun, and nampayn contrast
with kantk in that their objects, when pronouns, must be in the form
of the bound possessive prefixes (see Section 4.5). This is prohibited for
kantk, whose pronoun objects must be the free forms.

Temporals express the time setting of an action. Temporals are of two
types in Yimas, basic temporals and nouns metaphorically used as tem­
porals. Basic temporals are themselves of several types:General temporals:muntawktn
kal]kran
tampin
mpa'at first'
'before, early'
'after, later'
'now, already'Parts of the day:kratut
tumpntut
aJ]kayapan
wut'twilight' (5:00-6:00)
'morning' (6:00-9:00)
'late afternoon' ( 17:00-19:00)
'night' ( 19:00-5:00)WORO CLASSES1 10There is no specific word to refer to the main part of the day from about
9:00-17:00 hours. The general word tmal 'sun, day' can be used for
this period, and more specifically, the phrase kpa tmal 'big sun' can be
used for the middle, hottest part of the day. In parallel fashion, kpa
wut 'big night' can be used to refer to the period around midnight. In
addition speakers often use the Tok Pisin word belo 'noon' for the very
specific period between 12:00-13:00, when government offices are closed,
and people would have lunch in the towns.
Day counters:kwarkwa
IJarlJ
urakr!J
tnwant!J
kampraJlCIJ
manmaJlCIJ'today'
'one day removed'
(i.e., 'yesterday, tomorrow')
'two days removed'
'three days removed'
'four days removed'
'five days removed'Yimas has the interesting, but not unusual, Papuan system of reckoning
time from the point 'now' Janus-like in both directions, so that one day
in the past (yesterday) and one day in the future (tomorrow) are both
denoted by the same term varr). The actual time referred to by varr.J is
distinguished by the choice of tense on the verb, near past (yesterday)
versus near future (tomorrow) (see Section 5.2.1).
Yimas also has two basic nouns used metaphorically as temporals.
These nouns contrast with all previous temporals in that when they are
used as temporals, they must be suffixed with the oblique case suffix.
mlantrm-nan
moon, month V DL-OBL
'in two months'tmat-jlan
sun, day V SG-OBL
'during the day'They are, however, not the only temporals which some morphological
features of nouns. A few temporal words from all types except the
general temporals may form close-knit noun phrases with the adjective
ma- 'other' to mean 'on another ' Such noun phrases formed with the
temporal nouns or the words for parts of the day occur with the oblique
suffix.

hibited from taking the oblique suffix.","[122, 123, 124, 125, 126]"
"INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS412suffix on the main verb. This is typical of negative oblique clauses. The
non-finite oblique clauses are within the same time frame as the main
clause and express events whose non-occurrence right now is responsible
for the circumstances holding in the main clause. Thus, in (7-75a) the
speaker's decision not to return is contingent on whether the women
come or not. If they do not come, the situation of the main clause will
eventuate. Similar remarks apply to (7-75c ). The middle example (775b) is perhaps the most interesting. The failure of the plane to arrive
will leave the speaker and his group without food. This situation is thus
summed up in the query which forms the main clause, 'what do we eat?'.
An interesting difference between positive and negative non-finite
oblique clauses concerns word order possibilities. While core arguments
of positive non-finite oblique clauses can occur after the verb, as exam­
ples (7-70b,e) demonstrate, this is not possible with negative non-finite
oblique clauses. So (7-76) is ungrammatical.
(7-76) *ya-kakan-0-nan

This may indicate that -kakan 'without', like kantk 'with', is a postpo­
sition and governs an NP constituent preceding, blocking any possible
extraction from it.
-7.2 Finite NominalizationsFinite nominalizations contrast with non-finite ones in that they require
a tense suffix and never take -ru NFN. Pronominal affixes may also occur
on verbs in finite nominalizations. Another typical morphological feature
of finite nominalizations, albeit not a universal one, is the near distal
deictic stem m-. The verbs of finite nominalizations commonly occur
suffixed to this stem, replacing the normal class and number concord
suffixes, with the whole forming a complex nominal not unlike m-n NR
DIST-1 SG 'he'. The use of distal deictics to mark relative clauses is
common in Papuan languages (Reesink 1987; Olson 1981) and elsewhere
(note English that). In most languages, this occurs at the boundary of
the relative clause, but in Yimas it is a form bound, like a prefix, to the
inflected verb of the relative clause. This again reflects the polysynthetic
nature of the language; a relative clause will commonly consist of nothing
but a fully inflected verb, suffixed to m- NR DIST. A clause is again
realized as a word-level unit. Finite nominalizations have a similar range
of functions to their non-finite counterparts, except that they are neverFINITE NOMINALIZATIONS413used as complements. Their most common functions are as relative and
oblique (i.e., adverbial) clauses.
7.2.1 Finite Relative Clauses
Finite relative clauses are not an infrequent feature of Yimas discourse.
The verbs in finite relative clauses share a good deal in their morpho­
logical formation with modally inflected verbs, the discussion of which
the reader may care to review (see Section 5.2.2). Finite relative clauses
are typically marked by m- NR DIST, to which the fully inflected verb
is suffixed. (There is a sub-type of finite relative clauses which does not
employ m- NR DIST, and this will be discussed in detail later in this
section.) The stem m- NR DIST functions much like the wh word or
that in English-to mark the whole relative clause as a definite referring
expression. The other obligatory morpheme marking a finite relative is
a class and number concord suffix. These are the adjectival concord suf­
fixes for the various noun classes and occur as the final suffix of the verb,
except that human nouns do not distinguish class, i.e., masculine and
feminine nouns take the same set of suffixes, those found with modally
inflected verbs (see Section 5.2.2).

'the frog which I killed'
[m-ua-tay-nc-u]
c. krayu
frog VI SG NR DIST-lSG 0-see-PRES-VI SG
'the frog watching me'
The suffix -'T)k VI SG (-1) in word final position) occurs on each of the
verbs in these relative clauses, marking the class and number of these
nominalizations and hence indicating what noun is modified by them,
i.e., what are their head nouns. The same class and number concord
suffix is used regardless of the participant role of the relativized noun: S
in (7-77a), 0 in (7-77b), and A in (7-77c). This is typical of lower animate
and inanimate nouns, but higher animate and especially human nouns
are more complicated. It will be necessary to discuss relativization on
the differing participant role types separately.
The basic rule is that the noun which is being relativized is marked
only once, by the final class and number concord suffix. The relativized
noun may be defined as the noun coreferential to the 'head', but obli­
gatorily absent in the relative clause. Thus, in all three examples in414INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS(7-77) the relativized noun is krayv 'frog', the same as the 'head', but
it is obligatorily absent in these relative clauses and only traced by the
concord suffix agreeing with it in number and class. Relative clauses in
which the relativized noun functions as S are the simplest case, so let's
start there. The only agreement suffix permitted on a verb in a relative
clause with the S as the relativized noun is the final concord suffix; the
S cannot be also coded by a pronominal prefix. Consider these:
(7-78) a. namarawt [m-ya-t-0]
person I SG NR DIST-come-PERF-3SG
b.*namarawt [m-n-ya-t-0]
person I SG NR DIST-3SG S-come-PERF-3SG
'the person who came'
The relativized noun in both of these is the S participant, namarawt
'person'. This is, of course, the same as the head noun, and is marked
by the concord suffix 0. (Human singular nouns and singular nouns of
classes III and V are irregular in that instead of the expected concord
suffix -n, a zero morpheme is found. This is parallel to the usage with
modally inflected verbs.) Example (7-78b) is ungrammatical because
the S is coded twice on the verb, once by the concord suffix and also
by the pronominal agreement prefix n- 3SG S. The latter is completely
prohibited by the blanket rule against double marking of the relativized
noun.
When the relativized noun is an A argument, the resulting structure
is similar to that with relativization on an S. The verb can contain
pronominal agreement prefixes in addition to the obligatory concord
suffix, but these must code an 0 or D participant, never the A. The
morphology for marking a relativized A is identical to that for S.

person is first or second: third person prefixes are prohibited. So (7-80a)
is grammatical, but (7-80b) is not.

'the people who hit me'
[m-pu-tpul-c-um]
b.*namat
person I PL NR DIST-3PL O-hit-PERF-3PL
'the people who hit them'
The reason for this restriction is probably to eliminate ambiguity. Be­
cause the third person pronominal prefixes do not actually distinguish
participant roles as do those of the first and second persons, but vary
in form according to their word position, a form like (7-80b) would be
ambiguous as to whether pu- codes A or 0. In fact, a string like (7-80b)
can only have the meaning where pu- functions as the A.
When the relativized noun is 0, pronominal agreement prefixes of any
person are permitted on the verb to code the A participant. Consider
these examples:

Singular human nouns (and nouns of class III and V which behave
morpho- logically like them) have a special concord suffix - nak used
when the relativized noun is in 0 function.

This is the only concord suffix for relative clauses that actually codes the
participant role of the relativized noun. All others are oblivious to this.","[427, 428, 429, 430, 431]"

This form has no need of R spreading (rule (2-8)). The loss of F by rule
(4-18) above produces the desired phonetic forms, changing /wi/ to
/u/ v.
itAThe plural allomorphs for nouns of class VIII are rather irregular.
The great majority of these nouns have a plural allomorph -Cmpt, but
the choice of the initial consonant shows up variously as /c/ ( kacmpt
'canoes'), /Jl/ ( tarppmpt 'trees (sp)'), or /Jlc/ ( yaypcmpt 'clay pots').
The initial consonants do not seem predictable, but they are always
palatal and are derived from underlying alveolars by the palatalization
rule (2-3). This accounts for the variation in the form of the final vowel
of the stem, i.e., whether it is associated with the autosegment F or not.
The forms without it have simply shifted it to the following alveolar by
the palatalization rule (2-3). An alternative analysis here would be to
treat the plural allomorphs as beginning in underlying palatals and the
vowels preceding them as subject to the same rule of dissimilative F loss
the dual forms. At present, there is no evidence to decide between
these alternatives. In addition to this very common plural allomorph,
there is one example of -i (kalci 'black hawks') and two of -a (kump­
wia 'flying foxes', waykia 'cross beams'). It is also to be noted that
Htems with medial /TJ/, surrounded by segments which have the feature
F ( mayyi 'beetle (sp)' and awtmayyi 'sugarcane') have alternative forms
in the dual and plural in which the /TJ/ is palatalized to p ( mayppcmpt
'lu�etles (sp)' and awtmaypl 'two pieces of sugarcane').
The adjectival/possessive agreement suffixes for class VIII are derived
Himilarly to those of classes VI and VII. They are formed with the class
as152NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESmarker i (more abstractly, the class marker for VIII is simply F, the
front autosegment, attached to a V slot), plus the associated number
markers, -0 for singular and -l for dual. The plural is the irregular - ra ,
as with class VII.

The verbal prefixes are derived similarly. As the plural adjectival/
possessive suffix is - ra , the verbal prefix is, as expected, ya-, from 0 (class
marker) plus i- (plural) plus a- (non-singular). As the class marker for
class VIII is F, the singular prefix is i-, from the class VIII marker plus 0
(singular), and the dual is ila-, from i- (class VIII marker) plus l- (dual)
plus a- (non-singular).

Perception Complements
Perception complements describe an event which is the object of an act
of perception such as seeing or hearing. These are expressed in three
different ways in Yimas. The most straightforward of these parallels
English constructions like I saw him shearing the sheep. The S or A
participant of the perceived event is expressed as the 0 participant of
the main verb of perception, and the perceived event is expressed in
a finite relative clause with m- NR DIST, linked to this 0 participant.
These perception complements contrast with true relative clauses in that
they do not have free choice of tense. Regardless of the tense of the
main clause, that o( the perception complement must be imperfective,
morphologically realized by -nt PRES or, optionally, -kia-k NEAR-IRR.
Consider these examples:
(7-122) a. pu-ka-tay
3SG 0-1SG A-see
m-na-wi-impu-pra-nt-um
NR DIST-DEF-up-paddle-toward-PRES-PL

c. impa-ka-tay
nam m-na-wark-nt-rm
3DL 0-1SG A-see house NR DIST-DEF-build-PRES-DL
'I saw them both building a house'
The restricted tense possibilities in perception complements, practically
marking relative tense rather than absolute tense (imperfective si­
multaneous with the time of the main verb rather than with the time
of the speech act), essentially makes these perception complements like
non-finite constructions. It is predictable, then, that an alternative con­
struction for perception complements are true non-finite constructions.
Replacing the finite relative clauses in the examples of (7-122) are non­
finite oblique clauses.

There seems to be no meaning difference between the finite relative
clauses in (7-122) and the non-finite oblique clauses in (7-123). Both
constructions are equally common and acceptable.
The third construction for perception complements is finite, but oc­
curs with the suffixes - nti 'act' or - wal 'custom', the markers for non­
finite action complements (see Section 7.1.2) or finite manner clauses
(see Section 7.2.3). Consider these examples:
mnta wa-t-nti
(7-124) a. na-ka-tay
3SG 0-1SG A-see then go-PERF-act
'I saw him go.'
mnti kacakapi-k-nti
b. ta-!Jkl-cay-kia-k-nak
NEG-3PC A-see-NEAR-IRR-3SG 0 there hide-IRR-act
'Those few did not see him disappear.'
This construction is not common and has only been encountered with
tay- 'see'. As with the other perception complement constructions, its
S or A is realized as the 0 of the main verb. The verb of the perception
complement is finite in the sense that it has a tense suffix, but its tense
specification must be identical to that of the main verb. These per­
ception complements may be finite, but they are completely prohibited
from bearing verbal pronominal affixes for core arguments, rather like
non-finite complements. Although these constructions look superficially
like non-finite complements of action they cannot be analyzed as such.
The conjunction mnta 'then' is only allowed when clauses are joined; it
is prohibited in true non-finite complement constructions. The effect of
the suffixes - nti 'act' or - wal 'custom' is to nominalize the perception
clause, just as m- NR DIST does. The semantic force of this construc­
tion in comparison to the other two types of perception complements
is illustrated by the English glosses. The - nti construction looks at the
perceived event as a punctual, completed act, while the other two con-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS435structions focus on it as an ongoing, still perceived event. This is not
unlike the difference in English between I saw him disappear ( also I saw
his disappearance) (- ntif- wal construction) and I saw him disappear­
ing (finite relative clause with m- NR DIST or non-finite oblique clause ) .
This semantic difference in English is discussed in some detail in Kirsner
and Thompson 1976.
7.2.3 Finite Oblique Clauses
These correspond to English adverbial clauses, i.e., those subordinate
clauses beginning with when, if, because, although, after, etc. In Yimas
these are all formally the same construction, the semantic difference
between them being carried by the choices for tense and modal affixes.
Like their non-finite counterparts, the verbs of finite oblique clauses all
terminate in the oblique suffix - n '"""" - nan. Just as non-finite oblique
clauses are non-finite relative clauses plus the oblique suffix, a similar
pattern holds for finite oblique clauses. Consider these examples:
( 7-125 ) a. m-n-awram-r-mp-n
mpa-n
NR DIST-3SG A-enter-PERF-VII SG-OBL one-1 SG
namarawt anak

ta-ka-mampi-waraca-mpi-ya-kt
NEG-1SG A-again-return-SEQ-come-RM FUT
'When I go tomorrow, I won't come back again.'
As with finite relative clauses, the verbs in these oblique clauses begin
with m- NR DIST. The concord suffix - mp VII SG, following the tense
suffix and preceding the oblique suffix, is that for the understood noun
pucm 'time', having its class and number specifications. This is the un­
derstood noun modified by the relative clause, so that these finite oblique
clauses really mean something like 'at the time that X', but, in fact, the
noun never appears overtly. Its only indication is the final concord suffix
- mp VII SG, much like the understood noun for 'place' in the locational
relative clauses is referenced by - a IX SG. In essence these finite oblique
clauses with adverbial meaning and locational relative clauses are the
same type of construction: i.e., clausal nominalizations functioning in
oblique roles in the main dauHP and linked to no overt modified noun.","[448, 449, 450, 451]"
"4Nouns and Noun PhrasesNominals are those words which can stand on their own as referring
expressions. Besides nouns, other word classes which can function as
nominals are adjectives, quantifiers, some temporals, pronouns, and de­
ictics. A general morphological feature of nominals is specification for
number and noun class. These are inherent to each common noun, but
are assigned to other nominal types according to the noun they modify
or refer to. Because number and class are inherent features of common
nouns, and only acquired features of other nominal types, it is best to
organize the study of these features around the various classes of nouns.
The number inflection of nouns varies with class, so these two features
will be treated together. Yimas also has a set of proper nouns, which
function as names for people and places. These are never assigned to
any noun class and are not inflectable for number.
4.1 Noun Classes
Yimas has ten basic noun classes with a reasonably large number of
members and a half dozen or so minor classes with a single member
each. The basic noun classes are of two types: those with a semantic
basis for the assignment of members to the class, and those for which
the assignment is strictly phonological. There is one class that combines
both of these features. The assignment of nouns to classes is determined
by the system of adjectival agreement: all nouns with the same set of
agreement suffixes for adjectives belong to the same noun class, and any
noun with a different set · belongs to another noun class.
4.1.1 Class I
This class includes male humans and human beings whose sex is not
highlighted. It is therefore the unmarked class for human beings. Many
119NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES120of the nouns in this class show great irregularity and suppletion in their
formation of plurals. The dual is normally formed from the singular
by suffixing -rm, although there are some irregularities among its allo­
morphs. Consider the following examples of nouns from class I:

From these examples it can be seen that there is no distinctive mark
for the singular in class I, but that the dual, with the exception of
'son, child', is marked by the suffix -rm, added to the singular forms,
which function as the stems. However, only in the stems ending in /k/,
'father-in-law' and 'father's sister's husband' , is the formation simply
the stem plus the dual suffix -rm. All other stems, except those ending
in t (underlying /r/), require an intrusive /t/ between the stem and
the dual suffix, which is then subject to palatalization (rule (2-3)) if the
stem ends in a segment with F.
matn + -rm > matntrm
'brothers (DL)'
away + -rm > awaytrm > awacrm 'mother's brothers (DL)'
The second example can be represented diagrammatically as follows:NOUN CLASSES

Palatalization will not shift further to the right to effect lrI, as rule (2-3)
is specified in such a way so as to only affect [-peripheral] segments. lrl
is not specified for peripherality (see Table 3). All palatalized liquids
(i.e., Ill), are underlying, not derived. We can propose the following
rule to handle these cases of ltl epenthesis:
( 4-1) It I-epenthesis
0 -+ t l - + rm
{DL}
This rule will not apply if the stem ends in lkl or ltl. Finally, stems
ending in Ill as well as a few other sporadic cases (e.g., 'ceremonial
companion') add an epenthetic lnl as well.
takul + -rm > takulntrm > takulJlcrm 'brother-in-law'
'ceremonial companions'
yanaw + -rm > yanawntrm
This rule can be stated as follows:
( 4-2) lnl-epenthesis
0 -+ n l - + t + rm
{DL}
As we shall see later in the forms for classes III and V, both rule ( 4-1 )
and rule ( 4-2) are frequently encountered in Yimas. (Both rules can
apply to form optional variants of all class I nouns; thus, an alternative
dual form for apuk 'father's sister's husband' is apukntrm.)
The plurals of class I are much more complicated than the duals. A
number of forms, 'person', 'man', 'son, child', 'mother's brother', 'sister'sNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES122son', have suppletive forms for the plural stems. In addition, there are
three basic forms for the plural endings for class I nouns, grouped as
follows:
-t forms
- (uk)at
- (n)tt-m forms
-am
-urn-i form
-iIt is clearly impossible to collapse all of these allomorphs under a sin­
gle underlying form. Rather, we must recognize both morphologically
conditioned (i.e. , stem conditioned) allomorphs and phonologically con­
ditioned ones. That the former are absolutely necessary is established by
away 'mother's brother', PL: vawapct; but akay 'grandparent, grand­
son', PL: akayam. Clearly, there is no phonological conditioning which
could account for this contrast, and the proper plural allomorphs must
be entered lexically, as morphologically conditioned. Other allomorphic
choices are conditioned phonologically. For example, -i is the plural al­
lomorph following the peripheral stops fpf and /k/ (the jw / is provided
by the spreading of rounding from the previous syllable) .","[133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138]"
"2PhonologyFor a Papuan language Yimas has a fairly complex phonology, with
a significant inventory of phonological rules, especially those involving
vowels. Many morphemes exhibit a number of different phonetic forms
depending on the environment in which they appear. In order to pro­
vide significant generalizations about these morphemes, it is necessary
to propose abstract underlying forms which are converted into their ac­
tually occurring phonetic forms in each environment by the operation
of phonological rules. Many of these phonological rules are general and
will be treated in this chapter; those rules which are restricted to one or
a few morphemes will be discussed when those morphemes are treated
in later chapters. I will be employing a theoretical framework in this
ehapter based loosely on autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith 1979), in
which phonological features are associated with the segments in a ba­
sic consonant-vowel phonotactic schema in a number of hierarchically
organized tiers (see, for example, Goldsmith 1985, on the treatment of
vowel harmony). I have also adapted some ideas of Kiparsky's ( 1982,
1985) framework of lexical phonology, which proposes that there are two
major types of phonological rules: lexical phonological rules, which are
internal to the lexicon and apply when new, lexically specified stems are
derived from roots by morphological derivational processes; and postlex­
ical phonological rules, which apply to all forms generated by the mor­
phological processes of the language, not just those which are lexically
specified. The form of this theory necessarily stipulates that lexical
phonological rules precede postlexical ones. The form of this theoreti­
cal framework and its usefulness in the analysis of Yimas will become
apparent as the description proceeds.
In this chapter I will follow the following conventions: a form en­
closed in slashes, i.e., /x/, denotes a systematic phonemic or underly­
ing morphophonemic form; a form enclosed in square brackets, i.e. , [x] ,
37PHONOLOGY38represents a systematic phonetic surface form; and any form in italics
indicates a taxonomic phonemic ('classical phonemic') representation.
2 . 1 Consonants
2.1.1 Segmental Phonemes
Yimas has one of the simplest phonological inventories of any Papuan
language. It has only twelve underlying consonantal phonemes, and even
three of these are suspect. The consonant phonemes are
ofour stops and their corresponding nasals for four places of artic­
ulation,
stop nasalp
bilabial
t
dental-apical
c
palatal-laminal
k
velar
o two liquids,
palatal lateral
apical rhotic
o and two semivowels,
high, front, unrounded
high, back, roundedm
n
Jl
lJ
lY
r
y
wIJll and llY I. These often arise by transparent phonological rules in­
The problematic underlying phonemes are the palatal sounds, lcl,volving the palatalization of an adjoining dental-apical consonant by a
high front vowel or semivowel: for example, kay 'canoe' + - nan LOC >
ka(y)p,an 'in the canoe' , and tay- 'see', reduplicated becomes tacay 'see
repeatedly, stare'. A number of older speakers pronounce lril instead
of llY or show variation between these two realizations. Clearly some
occurrences of the palatals must be regarded as derived from under­
lying dental-apical sounds. However, for those cases of palatals which
never show alternation with a dental-apical there seems no compelling
reason for treating these other than as underlying palatals. These are
always internal to stems, for with the exception of llY which can occur
finally, a palatal may not occur stem initially or finally. These stem
internal palatals, which never alternate with dental-apicals, are taken as
underlying palatals. Examples of these are akulY im 'wrist', ip,cit 'urine',
akipip,an 'behind', and wacakin 'small'. Not surprisingly, many of these
palatals correspond to dental-apicals plus high front vowels in the cog­
nates of the related language Karawari ( awkurim 'hand', sindi 'urine').
A stop and its corresponding nasal generally have the same articula­
tory position, but other than this they often exhibit a wide divergenceII,CONSONANTS39of articulatory features. This is because the stops have a rather wide
range of allophonic variation, while the nasals have very little.
The nasals have no audible allophonic variation and are always artic­
ulatorily realized with the phonetic quality of the conventional symbol
chosen to represent them. There is a tendency for younger speakers
to merge /n/ and /TJ/ in initial position. So, while older speakers say
[IJarwA] for varwa 'penis', many younger speakers would say [narwA] .
The only major allophonic rule concerning nasals syllabifies them in fi­
nal position after a homorganic stop ( iripm [frap0rp] 'coconut palm', patn
[phat0r;t] 'betelnut'), or word internally between two stops, at least one of
which must be homorganic ( yaracukvkwi [yarAsuk01Jgwi] 'white (PL)' ) .
Stops, on the other hand, are much more varied . Following nasals,
they are generally voiced, though this is optional (kumpwi [khumbwi]
'flying fox', - ntut [-ndut] RM PAST, ipcit [lJ1jlt] 'urine', pamki [pamgi]
'legs'). The stops also have voiceless aspirated allophones. These oc­
cur in initial position and before stressed vowels ( tikay [thakhay] 'nose',
pikam [phakham] 'skin of back', triv [th ra!J] 'tooth') . Finally, stops are
not orally released preceding a nasal ( iripm [frap0rp]] 'coconut palm',
watn [wat0r;t] 'ironwood', wacakv [wAsak0 V ] 'small', atmpi [at0r;tbi] 'cut­
ting'.
The peripheral stops /p/ and /k/ are also subject to allophonic rules
of lenition. /p/ is likely to be voiced before a high back vowel ( irpulY ik
[frbulYik] 'black ants', kuput [khG>but] 'rain') . Before a /w/, it is likely
to be both voiced and lenited to [�] (ipwa [i�a] 'you (PL) ' ) . Lenition
is even more common with /k/. Intervocalically before an unstressed
vowel, /k/ optionally becomes voiced and spirantized to hl ( wakintit
[wa1indit] 'snakes', amanakin [AmAna""{in] 1 SG POSS). In final sylla­
bles, this lenited /k/ often disappears completely with compensatory
vowel lengthening; so, for example, the second example above would be
pronounced [AmAna· n] .
The palatal-lamina! stop jcj has the most complex allophony of the
four stops. Intervocalically, it is often realized simply as the voiceless
slit dental fricative [s] , but this varies according to age, with younger
speakers preferring [s] , while older speakers prefer the palatal-lamina!

stem internally, never initially or finally, with a couple of exceptions like
arc 'grandparent'. This must be a borrowed word, because in addition
to the aberrant final / c / , the consonant cluster / rc / is also disallowed in
Yimas, as all such clusters must agree in palatality, i.e., Yimas demands
/lc/. The presence of both these aberrant features marks this word as
outside the normal system of Yimas phonology.
The palatalized lateral /lY / has two phonetic realizations, which are
seen in free variation: a strongly palatalized apical lateral [lY] or a
palatal-laminal lateral [i]. Examples are walY [wa<lY] ""' [wa<i] 'wind',
mikilY [makllY] ,....., [maklA] 'monitor lizard', and walY amuv [wa<lY AmG>IJ]
""' [wa<iAmG>IJ] 'basket'. Note that as in the above examples, vowels are
quite fronted preceding the phoneme flY / . This applies somewhat to
all palatal consonants, but is most apparent with /lY /. In some cases
the fronting of /a/ may be so pronounced that it becomes a low front
vowel or takes on the character of a diphthong ( walY amuv [w::eiY AmG>IJ]
""' [waylY AmG>IJ] 'basket').
The apical rhotic /r/ varies freely in most environments between
an apical lateral [1] and an alveolar tap [r] ( irak [ilak] ""' [irak] 'dance',
pramuv [phlamG>IJ] ""' [phramG>IJ] 'sleep') . But following the dental-apical
stop /t/, only the tap articulation is allowed ( triv [thrau] * [thlau] 'tooth',
amtra [amdrA] * [amdlA] 'food', trukwa [thrukwA] * [thlUkwA] 'knee').
Elsewhere, some speakers prefer one articulation over the other, but
there is no hard and fast rule, both being acceptable. The [1] articula­
tion is most favored intervocalically and the [r] elsewhere, but this is just
a tendency. /r/ may not occur word initially or finally and is subject
to some complex phonological rules which convert it to /t/ (see Section
2.3.2).
Yimas has two semivowels, a high front unrounded /y/ and a high
back rounded /w / . I have defined these in terms of vocalic features like
front rather than consonantal features like palatal, because as we shallCoNSONANTS41see, they interact in fundamental ways with the vowel system of Yimas.
I will therefore defer further discussion of these features until treating
vowels in Section 2.2.
The distinctive features of the consonants of Yimas are represented
in Table 3. Some of the features chosen may seem strange at this point,
but the reasons for their selection will become apparent as the vowel
system and phonological rules are presented. They have been chosen to
provide the maximally simple and transparent statement of the phono­
logical rules. Henceforth, I will represent the palatal lateral phoneme
llY I simply as Ill.
2.1.2 Consonant Clusters
At the phonetic level, initial and final consonant clusters in Yimas are
strongly constrained, but they are rather freer word-medially. Yimas
words can begin in a vowel (gvkayapan 'afternoon', !Jtcit 'urine') or
any consonant other than lrl or the palatals lcl, IJll or 111. Clusters
of no more than two consonants can begin a word. The permissible
combinations are any stop (other than lcl) plus lrl (pramuv 'sleep',
kiv 'tooth', kramnawt 'three') or IP, kl plus lw I (pwipciniv 'cross
beams', kwarkwa 'today'). Finally, initial clusters of homorganic nasal
plus stop are permitted ( mpum 'large crayfish', vkak 'go'). Palatal nasal
plus stop initial clusters are, of course, prohibited by the general ban on
initial palatals.
This last possibility might be seen to argue for unit phonemes of pre­
nasalized voiced stops, abrogating the need to posit these ad hoc lmpl
initial clusters. There are a number of arguments against this analysis.
First of all, as pointed out in Section 2.1.1, homorganic nasal plus stop
clusters following another stop are realized with the nasal as syllabic.
This would be very difficult to account for if the entire cluster nasal
plus stop were a unit phoneme. Second, non-homorganic nasal plus
stop clusters are common in the language, such as namtampara 'foot' or
manpa 'crocodile'. The language provides no evidence for distinguish­
ingnon-homorganic nasal plus stop clusters from homorganic ones, and
it is simplest to treat all as clusters. Third, the language has a highly
productive rule of nasal truncation, reducing sequences of nasals to one,
which is simplest to state if the nasals are always treated as separate seg­
ments (see Section 2.3.5), as in pamuvk+i > [pamgi], where the cluster
lm+ul reduces to [m]. Finally, I have been able to discover fewer than
ten stems in the entire language which begin in nasal plus stop clusters,
the great majority of which begin in lmpl. There is only one example
of Inti and one of lukl, and both are verb stems normally preceded by
prefixes. This set of stems with initial nasal plus stop clusters is42PHONOLOGYImpI: mpan 'one', mpa 'now, already', mpum 'large crayfish',
mpunawv 'elbow', mpuvkan 'crowned pigeon',
mpivam 'navel', mpatnpara 'few', mpimtak 'cross river'
Int i : ntakik 'leave'
IIJkl: vkak 'go by land'
This small inventory is much more in keeping with an analysis of these
as initial consonant clusters, all examples of which are quite rare, rather
than as a single initial consonant.
In summary, Yimas words can begin with up to two consonants,
summarized in the following formula:
# ( C1 ) ( C2 ) V
Both consonants are optional, i.e., a word can begin in a vowel. If (C2
is missing, then C1 may be any consonant except the palatals and lrf).
If cl and c2 are both present, only the following three possibilities are
allowed:
( a) C1 = non-palatal stop
c2 = lrl
(b ) c1 = IP , k l
c2 = lwl
(c ) C1 = nasal
c2 = homorganic stop
Permissible final clusters are even more restricted. Yimas words can
end in vowels: manpg, 'crocodile', awakj 'stars'. They can also end in
any consonant except the palatals lcl and IJll (Ill may end a word) ,
and IrI. The only final consonant clusters allowed are a stop plus a
homorganic nasal (always syllabic as discussed in Section 2.1.1) ( iripm
'coconut palm' patn 'betelnut' and wasakv 'small' ) . The finals of Yimas
words can be summarized in the following formula:
V( C1 ) ( C2 ) #Medial clusters are much more varied than both initials and finals.
Clusters of up to three consonants are permitted in this position. All
Yimas consonants can occur intervocalically, but need not occur, as
vowel clusters are allowed (kiav 'cough') . Medial clusters of two elements
are of three types, depending on the initial consonant. Yimas does not
permit geminates; so, for example, clusters of nasal plus nasal may not
be homorganic.
Type 1: C1C2 where C1 = nasal and
c2 = stop:
manpa 'crocodile', vimkivin 'below'
c2 = nasal:
kramnawt 'three' panmal 'male'
'CONSONANTS43C2 = semivowel:

c2 = semivowel:

Type 3: C1 C2 where C1 = liquid and
C2 = stop: (/1/ only with /c/ and * /rt/): warkapwi 'wallaby',
mak;awkwa 'lower back'
C2 = nasal: (/1/ only with /Jl/ and */rn/): narmav 'woman',
walpakin 'light'
c2 = semivowel (only /rw/): varwa 'penis'
but not *C2 = liquid
Medial clusters of three consonants are much more restricted. Most
of those involve a nasal plus stop cluster. The first type of cluster with
three consonants is a nasal plus stop cluster, followed by a liquid or
semivowel,
Type 1: c1C2C3 where cl = nasal, c2 = stop, and
awantrim 'cassowaries (DL) ', numpran
c3 = /rf:
-- 'pig',
tantayvkraym 'spider'
tumpwik 'yellow', nuvkwara 'hand'
Examples in which C3 = /w/ require the nasal and stop to be homorganic
and peripheral (i.e., labial or velar).
Type 2: C1C2C3 where C2 = peripheral nasal, C3 = peripheral stop,
and
ilvk apuk 'go down', alvkat 'machete (PL) ',
cl = liquid:
tikirvkat 'chair (PL) '
cl = stop:
matpci 'bird (sp) ', atnpi 'cutting',
yaracikvki 'white'
The medial nasals in these last cluster types are always syllabic, as
discussed in Section 2.1.1. Other clusters of three consonants are formed
with /r/ followed by a stop,
Type 3: C1 C2C3 where C1 = /r/, C2 = peripheral stop and
C3 = nasal
irpmul 'two coconut palms'
kwarkwa 'today', tarpwa 'belly'
c3 = /w/:
Combining the statements of permissible consonant clusters in initial,PHONOLOGY44medial and final position, we may state that a Yimas word has the
following consonant-vowel (CV) skeletal structure:
(2-1) # ( C1 )( C2 ) V1 ( [ ( C 3) C 4 ( C 5W) V2 ( C6)( C 7) #where the constraints on the initial, medial and final clusters are those
described above. Both affixes and roots conform to this CV skeletal
structure. According to this skeleton, the simplest Yimas word would be
a vowel, and there is such a form, the verb stem i- 'say'. The superscript
over the medial syllable allows it to iterate this syllable a number of
times to produce syllables of more than two syllables. The longest roots
are around five or six syllables, for example mamantakarman 'land crab'
or tivkimpipawa 'bird (sp) '; but words can be much longer, as in these
tongue twisters: navanavkanampanira 'you all give those to them few'
or kampupaymatakatnampanim 'let them paint them all inside first'.
Syllabification in Yimas is generally transparent. If a single con­
sonant occurs between two vowels, the syllable boundary precedes it
(V.CV ) . With clusters of two consonants, it falls between the two con­
sonants
VC1 .C2V) , unless C1
stop and C2 /r/, in which case it
precedes (the cluster (V.C1 C2 V) . For clusters of three consonants, the
syllable boundary follows the first consonant (VC1 .C2C3V) .
n==In terms of phonetic contrasts, Yimas presents a system of four vowels,
/i/, /i/, /u/, and /a/ as documented by the following minimal pairs:
mum 'they', mim 'it', mam 'another', mi 'you( SG ) '; pikriv 'fart', pikriv
'mouth'. However, a simple list of minimal pairs such as these dis­
guises some important facts about the Yimas vowel system. Not all
these vowels are equally common. Together /i/ and /a/ account for
the overwhelming percentage of vowel tokens in Yimas, over 90%, with
/u/ coming next and /i/ decidedly rare, perhaps 1%-2% of all vowel
tokens. Furthermore, /i/ and /a/ have extensive allophonic variation,
varying widely over the vowel space, but /u/ and especially /i/ have a
very narrow range.","[51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]"
"NON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS407The noun modified by the non-finite relative clause in (7-66b) is kumpwi
'boys'. This is marked on the relative clause by the concord suffix - i I PL.
Example (7-68a) lacks an overt independent 'head' noun for the relative
clause. Rather it is simply represented by the pronominal agreement
prefix kay- lPL A, and this in turn is linked to the coreferential concord
suffix -mat following -kakan 'without' in the relative clause. The final
example illustrates a negative non-finite relative clause modifying an
inanimate noun, in this case, houses DL, indicated by the proper concord
suffixed - nml 'houses' DL following -kakan 'without' (with loss of its final
/n/ before the initial /n/ of - nml houses DL).
Negative non-finite relative clauses contrast with positive ones in that
they are not restricted to S or A participants as the relativized noun.
Rather they permit any core argument to function as such, and this
often results in ambiguity.

that people don't kill. ,{}The first reading in (7-69) comes from taking the relativized noun to be
the A argument of the relative clause, while the second takes it as the
0. Further examples of this ambiguity are in the examples of (7-68): in
the (a) example the relativized noun is the A participant, while in (b)
it is the 0 .
Non-Finite Oblique Clauses
One of the most common features of Yimas narratives is a type of non­
finite clause whose function is rather like English participles in - ing in
examples like sitting in the chair, he saw the mouse underfoot. As with
English participles, the corresponding Yimas constructions are not in­
flected for tense but are assigned the same tense as the following fully
inflected main verb. The Yimas construction also has much the same
meaning as English - ing participles: to express an event basically simul­
taneous with that of the main verb.
Non-finite oblique clauses are formed like most non-finite clauses in
Yimas, with - ru suffixed to a verb. This is followed by one of the concord
suffixes. This codes the number and gender or class of the S or A par­
ticipant of the oblique clause, which may or may not be overtly present.
Finally"" comes the oblique suffix, - n ""' - nan. The oblique suffix always
takes the form -JtaTI following the Huffixes ending in /t/ indicating that
7.1.5408INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSthe underlying forms of these suffixes actually terminate in palatals. But
as the oblique suffix is the only morpheme to follow them there is no
independent way to ascertain this. Also, the final /IJ/ of the suffix - mav
F SG is always lost before the oblique suffix.

As with all the other non-finite constructions in Yimas, these non-finite
oblique clauses are again nominalizations, for only nominals may be
suffixed with the oblique suffix. In each of these examples the agentive
nominalization suffixes mark the number of the S (examples (7-70a,d,e),NoN-FINITE NoMINALIZATIONS409or A (examples (7-70b,c) argument of the oblique clause, which otherwise
may be completely lacking, as is the case in all the above examples,
except (7-70a,e). Verbs in non-finite oblique clauses may be suffixed
with -kia; this is in fact obligatory if the main verb is marked with -kia,
as in examples (7-70a,c,e). It is not uncommon for -kia in these non­
finite oblique clauses to be followed immediately by -k IRR and then - ru
NFN, as in the following example:
(7-71) mpa irm-kia-k-r-ukt-]lan
now stand-NEAR-IRR-NFN-PC-OBL
paukra-na-ma-uka-pu-kia-k
lPL S-DEF-in-go by land-away-NEAR-IRR
'Standing now, we few walked inside.'
Constructions like (7-71) plus its use in purpose clauses and elsewhere
(to be discussed in Section 7.2.2) suggest that the irrealis is well on
its way to being re-analyzed as a non-finite marker. Another point in
support of this view is that -k IRR can sometimes replace -ru NFN
altogether in these constructions as in ( 7-72) below. (Note that verbs
in non-finite oblique clauses can and commonly do consist of a serial
verb construction forming a complex verb theme. One such example is
(7-70c).)
A very important point of contrast between non-finite oblique clauses
and the other non-finite constructions discussed in this chapter is that
they are never obligatorily controlled. As we have seen, the S and A par­
ticipants of these clauses can be freely omitted, but if this is done, they
are not always completely recoverable within the sentence. For example,
the A participant of (7-70b) need not be kumpwi 'boys'. It could just as
easily, and perhaps more likely, be ipa 'we', with the sentence meaning
'while we were building a house, the boys left the village'. Note also that
in examples (7-70c,d) the S and A participants of the non-finite oblique
clause correspond to no core argument of the main clause of the sentence
which contain them. They are, however, equivalent to core participants
in previous sentences. As a further example of these discourse-controlled
missing S/ A participants in non-finite oblique clauses, consider the fol­
lowing example:

'And right then I told those two ""Light a fire! I'm very
hungry."" Then while we were sitting, Kayan paddled in
toward us and I called out to him.'
In this example, the S participant of the non-finite oblique clause con­
sisting of tay mpa taw-kia-k-vkt-pan 'while sitting down' is 'we', never
mentioned explicitly in the discourse, but is the group consisting of the
speaker and companions. The speaker, of course, was the A participant
of the previous clause and his companions that of the clause before.
That the speaker and his companions are the S of the non-finite oblique
clause is simply established by inference of the hearer.
While the above examples establish that the referent of a missing S
or A participant need not be in the sentence containing the non-finite
oblique clause, it is, of course, the case that they may be. More often
than not, the referent is a core argument of the main clause joined to
the non-finite clause. Example (7-71) above illustrates this. The S of
the main clause is also the S of the non-finite oblique clause. Further
examples are in (7-73) in which the referent is the A (7-73a) or the D
(7-73b) in the main clause.

Because the referent of the missing S or A argument can be corefer­
ential with any core argument or indeed none at all, sentences containingNON-FINITE N OMINALIZATIONS411them can be ambiguous, if the agreement suffixes are right. Consider
the following examples:
(7-74) pu-kra-ant-t
pan-t-mat-jlan
3PL A-lPL 0-hear-PERF pound sago-NFN-M PL-OBL
'They heard us when pounding sago.' (either they or we could
be pounding sago)
The verb in the non-finite oblique clause is coded as having a plural S
argument by the suffix - mat M PL. But both core arguments of the main
clause are plural, so that both can serve as referents for the missing S
argument, resulting in the sentence being ambiguous.
Yimas also possesses negative non-finite oblique clauses in addition
to the positive ones. Like the negative non-finite relative clauses, these
are formed with -kakan plus agentive nominalization or class concord
suffixes, which again mark the number and gender or noun class of the S
or A argument of the oblique clause, which may or may not be overt. Fol­
lowing this comes the oblique suffix - n ""' - nan, exactly as with their pos­
itive counterparts. As we have seen, positive non-finite oblique clauses
express states which hold or events which occur within the time frame
of the main verb, i.e., they must be simultaneous. Negative non-finite
oblique clauses are simply the converse of this: they express states or
events which may not occur during the time frame of the main verb.
The practical effect of this is to produce a conditional sentence 'if not X,
then Y' (for more detailed discussion on conditionals, see Section 7 2 3)

normally prohibited from occurring word-finally. There may be recent
loans from neighboring languages, but in any case they are assigned to
class V.

With such a large, heterogeneous class, it is not surprising that the
marking for number exhibits a considerable degree of allomorphy. The
dual is much simpler than the plural: all class V nouns take the suffix - rm
(-tm following a nasal, as in yampn-tm tree (sp)-DL). The rules of /n/
and /t/ epenthesis obligatorily apply only in some forms. They apply
universally to stems ending in fpf and /r/ and may never apply to those
ending in /nt/, presumably because the output of the rules, the cluster
/nt/, is already present. As the above examples clearly demonstrate,
stems ending in other segments exhibit some variation. All dual forms
with obligatory /n/ and /t/ epenthesis, of course, exist in those forms
only, but those without have hypercoristic alternative forms in which
these rules apply. So, alternating with awak-rm star-DL 'two stars',
there is the acceptable, albeit less common, awak-ntrm. FUrther, there
are generational differences in the application of the epenthesis rules in
this class. Younger speakers, i.e., under thirty, have a much greater
tendency to use the epenthesized forms than not. This undoubtedly
reflects a process of regularization in the system, for the epenthesized
forms are the most common, and are equivalent to the form of the dual
adjectival/possessive suffix for this class, i.e., -ntrm.
The stems ending in nasals never have overt /n/ epenthesis, merely
ft/ epenthesis. This is a likely reflection of the nasal truncation rule
(2-15): irmpT) 'slit drum' + -rm DL would become * irmpvntrm by /n/
and /t/ epenthesis, and finally irmpvtrm, an acceptable form, by nasal
truncation. Note that if neither epenthesis rule applies to stems ending
in nasals, the initial /r/ of - rm DL strengthens to t following the nasal
( irmpv-tm 'slit drum (DL)').
The plural allomorphs are much more complex. These class V nouns
present not less than four distinct plural allomorphs. They are classified
below according to final segments of the nouns they occur with:
- vkat ""' -kat (after nasals)
""' - at (after /k/): jp, k, m, n, 1J , r, 1, i, y, cj
-i ""' - y (after vowels) :
jk, nj
·-ra:
/n/
-t:
/n, nt, r/140NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESThis chart clearly indicates that -vkat is the unmarked plural allomorph
for class V, as it occurs with all final segments except /nt/. This con­
jecture is further supported by the fact that when a speaker is unsure of
the proper suffix, he will invariably correct to -vkat, provided the final
segment is anything but /n/. The plural allomorph -ra is so uniquely
associated with final /n/ that this is always the choice for nouns ending
in this consonant. However, loan words into Yimas from Tok Pisin which
fit into class V phonologically are also pluralized with -vkat, even if they
do end in /n/ (Tok Pisin sospen 'saucepan' > Yimas tcpn, PL: tcpn-kat) .
The allomorph -i is predominately associated with stems ending in
/k/, although it occurs with one noun ending in /n/ ( nawran 'armband',
PL: nawray). This suffix is, of course, the primary plural formative for
class III nouns, and this demonstrates again the close relation between
class III and class V. Nouns ending in /k/ which do not take -i use -vkat,
almost always in the form - at. The difference between -i and - vkat for
/k/ final stems may be phonological: all examples of -i plurals have the
vowel /a/ in the previous syllable. As mentioned previously, the plural
formative -ra is uniquely associated with /n/-final nouns, but there are
exceptions. In addition to the examples of -vkat and -i plurals, there are
also /n/ final nouns with the plural -t, e.g., wun 'sago grub', PL: wunt.
Sporadically, nouns ending in /n/ lose this segment before adding the
plural suffix ( yan 'tree, wood', PL: ya-ra; tamun 'big mouth fish', PL:
tamu-t). The plural suffix - t , besides being occasionally found in these
/n/-final stems, is the unexceptional choice for nouns ending in /nt/ and
also occurs with monosyllabic /r/-final stems containing the vowel /a/
( tat 'spikes on sago palm', PL: tart).
The adjectival/possessive agreement suffixes for class V nouns are
close to those of classes I and III.
SG
DL

-n(ADJ), -kn(POSS)
Only the plural diverges from the suffixes of class III. It is the same
form as the plural suffix for class IV. Note that the dual form is -rm
with obligatory /n/ and /t/ epenthesis. This is invariable, regardless of
whether the noun modified has /n/ or /t/ epenthesis in its dual form.
The following examples illustrate the use of these suffixes:

V are close to those of classes I and III, again with a divergence in the
plural. (As mentioned in the discussion of class IV affixes, a plural
adjectival/possessive suffix - ra is always correlated with a verbal prefix
ya-.) The verbal prefixes for class V are given below:

4.1.6 Class VI

The formations here are regular and pretty straightforward. The
stems end underlyingly in /uk/. As the singular has no overt affixation,
this cluster appears word-finally and becomes /IJ/ by rule (2-14). The
dual is formed by suffixing - l, as in class IV, but there is no spread of R
for class VI nouns, even if the vowel of the final syllable of the stem is juj.
Note that the dual form of pamuv 'leg' is pamkl, pronounced [pamgil],
not *[pamgul]. The deletion of juj in the dual forms is of course the
result of the /u/ deletion rule (2-9), but it appears that with this class
(and only with this class), there is no compensatory R spreading. As
will be discussed in Section 4.1.10, there are two ways to deal with this
problem: as a morphologically conditioned exception to R spreading, or
as a stipulation on the /u/ deletion rule for class VI nouns that functions
to delete the R autosegment as well as the V slot in the CV skeleton.
Contrast the derivations of the dual forms of class IV irpm 'coconut
palm' with class VI pamuv 'leg':

This behavior of class VI nouns cannot be put down to phonological
reasons, i.e., the differences in stem-final /m/ and /!Jk/. As we shall
see later in Section 4.1.10, there is another class, class X, which is like
class VI in having stems ending in /IJk/, but for which juj deletion and
R spreading operate normally. (It needs to be pointed out that pamkul
is in fact a possible variant for some speakers, although pamkil is the
preferred form. This would suggest that the operation of juj deletion
with this form, and others like it, is in fact variable, sometimes deleting
just the V slot, and sometimes deleting the autosegment R as well).
The plural of class VI nouns is formed by suffixing -i, with the same
battery of phonological rules such as juj deletion (2-9) and nasal trun­
cation (2-14). Again, juj deletion is typically exhaustive so that there
is no R spreading. Hence the normal plural of pamuv 'leg' is pamki
(pamkwi is, however, a marked alternate).
The adjectival/possessive agreement suffixes for class VI are trans­
parently derived from the noun inflections. As with the nouns, they
are the class marker -vk plus the number marker 0 for the singular, the
number marker - l for the dual, and the number marker - i for the plural,
as follows:
PL
DL
SG
-JJk
-!Jki
-!Jkl
The singular form will of course be realized as v in word-final position
hy rule (2-14). Examples of these suffixes follow:
urkpwica-k-IJ
ama-na-IJ
( 4-14) a. trlJ

ama-ukl
b. muntankl
kidney VI PL bad-IRR-VI PL 1SG-POSS-VI DL
'my two bad kidneys'
The verbal prefixes for class VI are also derived from the noun inflec­
tions. The basic class marker -vk sheds its nasal and becomes a prefix
for the verbal class marker. The singular verbal prefix is simply that,
i.e., k-, from k- (class VI verbal marker) plus 0 (singular). The dual
is kla- from k- (class VI) plus l- (dual marker) plus a- (non-singular
marker), constructed in parallel fashion to the verbal prefixes of classes
IV and V. The plural verbal prefix kia- is much the same: k- (class VI)
plus i- (plural marker) plus a- (non-singular).

The numerals and deictics for this class are formed as expected, by
adding the adjectival/possessive suffixes to 'one' and 'four' and the near
distal deictic stem and the verbal prefixes to 'two', 'three', and the prox­
imal and far distal deictic stems.

4.1.7 Class VII
This class is marked by final /mp/, again simplified by rule (2-14) to m
in word-final position. It is similar in a number of respects to class VI,
but is not quite as regular in its formations.","[154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160]"
"BOUNDARIES AND THE NOTION OF THE WORD83Example (b) corresponds to (a) as negative to positive. Note that the
pronominal prefix p- in (a) appears as the corresponding suffix - m in
the negative example (b), as a result of its position being usurped by
the initial negative prefix ta-. Thus, we define the string flanked on
both sides by these affixes as a word, using the behavior of negation as
a grammatical criterion for determining words.
Unfortunately, this grammatical criterion is often at odds with pho­
nological ones. Consider this example with an incorporated nominal (S
marks the subject of an intransitive verb):
p-na-waca-k-m-ti-n
(2-23) mamam
sore VII SG VII SG S-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES
'The sore is getting smaller.'
waca-k-m small-IRR-VII SG is a derived nominal incorporated into the
verb and forming a grammatical unit with it (see Section 6.2.3. 1.3). This
is clearly demonstrated by the fact that when rule (2-23) is negated, the
usurped pronominal prefix p- becomes the suffix -m at the end of the
word, following the tense suffix -nt PRES.
(2-24) a. mamam
sore VII SG
ta-na-waca-k-m-ti-nt-m
NEG-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES-VII SG S
'The sore isn't getting smaller.'
*
b. mamam
sore VII SG
ta-na-waca-k-m-m-ti-n
NEG-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-VII SG S-become-PRES
Other pieces of evidence that this is a single grammatical word are
the behavior of valence-increasing prefixes. For example, if a causative
is derived from (2-23), the causative prefix tar- ""' tal- can precede the
incorporated nominal.
mamam
(2-25) marasin
medicine V SG sore VII SG
p-n-na-tar-waca-k-m-ti-n
VII SG 0-3SG A-DEF-CAUS-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES
'The medicine made the sore smaller.'
The whole sequence waca-k-m-ti- small-IRR-VII SG-become 'become
small' is causativized by tar- CAUS, again demonstrating that it func­
tions as a grammatical unit.
While the verbs in (2-23) and (2-24) are single words by grammatical
criteria, they are not so on phonological grounds. Consider the incor-84PHONOLOGYporated nominal waca-k-m small-IRR-VII SG again. Note that the class
and number concord marker appears as the word final allomorph - m
and not the word medial (and underlying) form -mp. This indicates a
word boundary between - m and the verb ti- 'become'. Stress patterns
also indicate two words, as the stress pattern for the verb in (2-23) is
p-na-waca-k-m-U-n, with both waca-k-n and ti- being assigned stress
independently (remember as discussed above, the pronominal prefixes
are unstressed and ignored by the stress rules when assigning stress) .
So on phonological criteria, the word would be represented as I# p­
na-waca-k-m # ti-n #I, while on grammatical criteria it would be I#
p-na-waca-k-m-ti-n #I. Clearly, this is contradictory, and in order to
solve this dilemma, it is necessary to appeal to two different notions of
word, a phonological word and a grammatical word. With the earlier
discussion of nouns and adjectives, this was not necessary, as the two
criteria types coincided (although in treating noun compounds a similar
distinction would need to be invoked in English as well as Yimas; see
Di Sciullo and Williams 1987) . But with verbs, this distinction is clearly
needed. Phonological words are those word units defined by phonological
criteria, while grammatical words are those determined by grammatical
criteria. Units defined as words in Yimas by the segmental phonological
rules and stress rules are phonological words; I will henceforth use the
word boundary symbol to indicate the boundaries of phonological words.
Sequences which behave as integrated units with respect to grammatical
processes like valence changing and negative (among others) are gram­
matical words. The boundaries of grammatical words have no special
symbol. Rather, I will use the practical orthography to indicate these.
Sequences of verbal morphemes that I write as single words correspond
to grammatical words (they may, of course, also correspond to phono­
logical words), and the sub-word morphological units will be set off from
each other by hyphens.
Another interesting example of the contrast between phonological
and grammatical words involves the very common Yimas construction
of verb compounding or serialization, in which two or more verb roots
join to form a complex verb, as seen in examples such as these:
(2-26) a. urauknut
coconut meat IX PL
ura-mpu-ntak-mpi-]la-ntut
IX PL 0-3PL A-leave-SEQ-stay-RM PAST
'They left the coconut meat.'
b. mamparukat
branches V PLBOUNDARIES AND THE NOTION OF THE WORD85ya-mpu-park-mpi-kapik-mpi-wark-t
V PL 0-3PL A-split-SEQ-break-SEQ-tie-PERF
'They split the branches, broke (them) and tied ( them) .'
Each of these verbs corresponds to more than one phonological word,
as shown by the number of primary stresses marked in each example.
Yet they each clearly correspond to one grammatical word. First of all,
negation applies to the verb as a whole, demoting the first pronominal
prefix to the end of the full sequence of morphemes.

Interestingly, it is in the area of compounds where nouns also show
a split between the phonological and grammatical word, albeit not as
extreme as that for the verbs. Yimas has a productive system of noun
eompounding employing the oblique ease suffix on the first member of
the compound, rather like the use of the genitive ease in German noun
compounds.","[98, 99, 100, 101]"

A negative verb with the paucal suffix may be potentially ambiguous
as it may not be clear which participant is modified by it. The basic
rule is that the paucal suffix is always interpreted as modifying a first or
second person participant, rather than a third person. Thus in (5-1 19e,
f, g) , - vkan indicates the paucal number of the first and second person
A prefix, and not the third person D prefix; these are not ambiguous.
In other cases, ambiguity is avoided by removing a pronominal affix for
one of the participants.

The negative of (5-120a) is (5-120b) , in which the paucal A participant
is prohibited from appearing on the verb as a pronominal affix and must
occur as an independent pronoun. The number suffix then references the
plural number of the second plural 0. If the paucal prefix is present, as
in (5-120c), it is interpreted as applying to the bound pronominal prefix
of the 0. This principle applies even when no ambiguity is possible.

The proper negative of (5-121), with a third paucal A and a second
dual 0, is (5- 121b), in which the number suffix is -rm DL, indicating
the number of the 0 (also coded in the pronominal prefix vkul- 2 DL
0). The presence of the paucal suffix -vkt as in (5-121c) results in
ungrammaticality, in spite of the fact that such a construction could
only unambiguously express a paucal A. The paucal suffix in negative262BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYverbs is in fact never allowed to reference the number of a third person
A; it is restricted to marking a third person paucal 0.

In (5-122a,b) , the suffix -vkt P C marks an 0 participant which is third
paucal. Note that (5-122a) with ka- 1SG A is grammatical, while (5121c) with vkul- 2DL 0 is not. This is because the paucal suffix is
restricted in third person to 0 participants only. Also, note that when
the third person paucal participant is an A, as in (5-122c), it is coded
by the corresponding pronominal prefix vkl- 3PC A, and the number of
the object is indicated by the negative number suffix.
The rules I have sketched above for negation apply to all verbs in
the language save one, the copula. While the copula in the positive
paradigm is inflected for person, number and noun class class, this does
not apply in the negative. There are two forms of the copula in the
negative: one used in equational statements and the other in possessive
constructions.
The form of the copula in negative equational statements is tampan.
This replaces all inflected forms of the copula presented in Section 5.1.5.

The reader will have noticed that examples (7-128b,c) lack the stem m­
NR DIST. This simply is due to the morphological constraint against
having m- precede two pronominal prefixes; both of these examples have
an 0 and an A prefix. In all of these examples, the tense specification
of the oblique clause is identical to that of the main clause. This is not
actually required, but is almost always the case. This morphological fea­
ture distinguishes these sequential oblique clause from the simultaneous
ones, which allow a present tense, regardless of the tense of the verb of
the main clause.
In the absence of any other markers, a sequential temporal relation­
ship is always entailed between a finite oblique clause and the main
clause. This is illustrated in (7-128a). There are no morphemes which
specifically express the sequential temporal relationship between the
clauses; this is simply the force of the construction. However, the other
three examples do have overt morphemes to indicate sequentiality. In
(7-128b) the conjunctions tay and mnta both mean 'then' and indicate
that the clause preceding the one in which they are found describes
events which are temporally prior. Example (7-128c) has the temporal
morpheme in the oblique clause. This is the incorporated adverbial pay­
'first' which indicates that the clause containing it describes events oc­
curring before those of the clause following. Finally, the finite oblique
clause in (7-128d) contains the temporal tampin 'after, later, behind',
which has much the same function as its English translation equivalent.
This last form is very likely a calque on the equivalent use of the Tok
Pisin adverb bihain 'after', and I suspect it is not traditional usage.
Yinias has no overt and distinct way of expressing adverbial clauses
equivalent to English cauHal dauHeH with bP-cau.� e or .�ince. This meaning440INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSis just an additional contextually based inference drawn from a finite
oblique clause in a sequential relationship to the main clause. A good
example is the following:
(7-129) m-mpu-na-malak-nt-mp-n
NR DIST-3PL S-DEF-converse-PRES-VII SG-OBL
pu-na-ti-kratk-n
3SG S-DEF-RCP-fight-PRES
'When/because they are arguing, they fight each other.'
A simple sequential temporal relational-they argue and then they
fight-is all that is necessarily entailed by this example. But given
the nature of the events of the two clauses, arguing and fighting, in
the real world, there is a very high likelihood that there is more than
this temporal relationship between them. More precisely, it would al­
most certainly be the case that the arguing led to the fighting as a
causal force. This is not entailed by (7-129) , but it is clearly a very
favored inference. Of course, how strongly favored this causal inference
would be varies with the events encoded, but it is potentially available
to any finite oblique clause and main clause in a sequential temporal
relationship.
Conditionals and counterfactuals are also expressed in Yimas by the
same kind of construction. What distinguishes these from sequential
and simultaneous temporal clauses is the presence of verbal affixes as­
sociated with unreal events, such as the irrealis suffix or modal prefixes.
Finite oblique clauses functioning as conditional clauses express events
which have not yet occurred, but which will lead, if they do occur, to the
consequential events described in the main clause. Hence, the tenses of
the main clause must be those of events not yet realized: imperfective,
near/remote future, irrealis, or the imperative mood. The tense of the
conditional clause can be identical to that of the main clause, marking
absolute tense (although the imperative, of course, is blocked in embed­
ded clauses); irrealis, indicating indefinite time; or either imperfective
or perfective, marking relative tense. Imperfective in the conditional
clause indicates simultaneity with the main clause (7-130a); perfective
indicates that the event of the conditional clause occurs prior to that of
the main clause (7-130b).

'If I had an axe, I would kill you'
Examples (7-130a,b) illustrate relative tense in the conditional clause,
imperfective (simultaneous with main clause) or perfective (prior to main
clause). Example (7-130d) shows irrealis for the conditional clause; this
indicates a general, not temporally bounded condition for the event of
the main clause. Finally, example (7-130c) has the remote future in both
the main and the conditional clause.
Conditionals contrast with counterfactuals in that while the former
are concerned with events which have not yet occurred, the latter de­
scribe situations which might or might not have occurred and then
expound the consequences of this. While the main clauses following
conditionals are marked with tenses for unrealized events, those follow­
ing counterfactuals have the tenses of realized events, the multiple past
tenses (and the irrealis, if used as a legendary past) and the perfective
and imperfective. In addition, the main clauses with counterfactuals are
invariably prefixed with ant- POT, the modal prefix encoding potential,
but probably unrealized actions (except for the negative copula verbs
tampan and kayak which do not permit this prefix). The verb of oblique
counterfactual clauses is also usually prefixed with ant- POT, but it may
be omitted, especially if the verb has no pronominal prefixes (7-131c).
ant- POT, of course, displaces m- NR DIST. Consider these examples of
counterfactual clauses:442INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS(7-131) a. tu�kur� ant-ka-tay-c-mp-n

Note that the potential modal prefix ant- can have either positive or
negative force in the corresponding English translation. Compare (7131a,b): the verbal forms are morphologically very similar, yet the for­
mer is translated as a positive verb in English and the latter as a nega­
tive. This is because the semantic force of a counterfactual depends on
the actual status in the real world of the event in the clause. Thus, in
the first example the eye was in fact not seen, so in the counterfactual
the clause is positive; but in the second, the patrol officer did indeed
come, so the counterfactual clause is negative.
Note that the tenses in the counterfactual clauses of all these exam­
ples correspond to those of realized events: perfective (7-131a), remote
past (7-131b,d), and imperfective (7-131c). Counterfactual clauses are
of two semantic types. The first type are those which describe poten­
tial events which failed to happen, with the main clause expressing theFINITE NOMINALIZATIONS443consequential events which would have occurred if the events of the
counterfactual clause had eventuated. Examples (7-131a,c) illustrate
this type. In (7-131a) the speaker would have killed the crocodile if he
had seen the eye, but because he failed to see it, he therefore did not kill
the crocodile. For (7-131c), the speaker would have lit a fire if he had
firewood, but because he has none, no fire is lit.
The second type of counterfactual clauses are those which describe
actual real events which occurred, but pose the hypothetical, counterfac­
tual situation of them not happening, with the event of the main clause
being the consequence of their non-occurrence. Examples (7-128b,d) il­
lustrate this type. The patrol officer did indeed come to Yimas, so the
counterfactual clause does express an actual event. But it poses the
counterfactual situation of his not coming, with the situation described
in the main clause being the result of his non-appearance. Similarly,
in (7-128d) the Yimas did indeed fight fiercely and have an abundance
of rich land. But the counterfactual clause posits the hypothetical sit­
uation of their not fighting, and conjectures the result would be a lack
of land.
The final semantic category of subordinate clauses formed on this
pattern are concessives. These are quite rare in Yimas and are formed
with the finite oblique clause in the sentence being positive and the main
clause negative.
The following example is illustrative:

'Although I pushed the canoe, I did not put it down into the

There is one final type of finite oblique clause to consider, manner
clauses, but these are formed quite differently from those treated far.
Rather than with - mp VII SG and - n ,...., - nan OBL, finite manner clauses
are formed using the suffix - nti 'act'.

"AN EXPLICIT ACCOUNT OF YIMAS VERBAL MORPHOLOGY3536.4 An Explicit Account of Yimas Verbal Morphology
In the last chapter and the previous sections of this chapter, I have pre­
sented a detailed discussion of the structure and categories of Yimas
verbal morphology. Within the verb, I have distinguished three levels of
structure: root, stem, and theme, and I have shown how the morphemes
of these three levels interact. I have also attempted a fairly careful de­
scription of the meanings and functions of the morphemes in the various
morphological categories, such as tense suffixes, pronominal affixes and
valence altering affixes, etc. In this section, I will try to draw all this
together and present a fairly explicit and coherent account of Yimas
verbal morphology.
Perhaps the primary bifurcation in the Yimas verb is that reflected
in the division of material between this chapter and the previous one.
This is the split between the categories within the verb theme, e.g. , ad­
verbials, serialized verbs, valence altering affixes, and those outside of
it, e.g., pronominal affixes, aspect, tense, and mood. In more traditional
terms, this corresponds. to the difference between derivational and inflec­
tional morphology, respectively. Derivational morphology is normally
described as that belonging properly to the lexicon, generating a new
complex form from a simplex base form, while inflectional morphology is
held to belong to the clause as a whole, specifying semantic and syntac­
tic categories at this level. Derivational morphology is usually optional,
while some categories of inflectional morphology in a language are of­
ten obligatory. While this distinction can be drawn in Yimas (as I just
did above), I do not believe it is of any great value in the description
of the language. I believe that ultimately all of the verbal morphology
in Yimas is produced as the result of derivational processes. There is
no sudden switch in the structural behavior of the verbal morphology
when one passes from inside of the verb theme to outside, so there are
no motivated grounds for drawing a distinction between two types of
morphology at this boundary. Rather the whole structure of a Yimas
verb is the result of ordered processes of morphological derivation, as I
will demonstrate below.
But before proceeding to this, let me first dispose of the argument
that the verbal morphology should be produced via syntactic rules. I
cannot consider all classes of morphology here, so let me consider what
might be the most promising cases-valence altering. There are a cou­
ple of compelling arguments for treating valence changing as a lexical
derivation process and not a case of a syntactic rule. First, note that
although Yimas has numerous productive valence increasing affixes, the
final output of these derivations can never be more than a trivalent verb
stem, the maximum permitted for underived verb roots like va- 'give' or354THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREi- 'tell'. In other words, the result of the valence increasing rules must
be the equivalent of the valence of a base lexical item. This constraint
makes sense if the valence increasing rules occur in the lexicon, but does
not if they are independent syntactic processes.
Now let me consider the second argument. Remember, as noted in
earlier sections, that valence increasing prefixes may have alternate con­
structions involving postpositions, as in the following examples, repeated
from previous sections.( 6-150) a. ipa kantk pu-mampi-wa-k
1PL with 3PL S-again-go-IRR
'They went with us. '
b . pu-kra-mampi-tau-wa-k

'They went with us.'

'He turned back and came toward her.'
b. na-n-way-mpi-ira-ya-ntut
3SG 0-3SG A-turn-SEQ-ALL-come-RM PAST
'He turned back and came toward her.'
In the ( a) examples, a participant in the event appears as an oblique
phrase, while in the ( b ) examples, it is a core argument. Thus, oblique
nominals marked by the postpositions kantk 'with' and nampan 'toward'
correspond to core nominals coded by the valence increasing prefixes tav­
COM or ira- ALL, respectively. From the structural alternations and the
paraphrase equivalences between the ( a) and (b ) examples above, one
may conclude that there is a convincing case for a productive syntactic
process in Yimas which promotes oblique nominals to core arguments,
much as dative shift constructions are commonly analyzed in English:
he gave a book to Mary becomes he gave Mary a book.
This analysis, however, runs into immediate problems when we con­
sider the entire range of valence increasing affixes in Yimas. For most
of these, unlike tav- COM and ira- ALL, there is simply no alternative
construction in which the core argument licensed by the valence increas­
ing prefix appears as an oblique nominal. In other words, there are no
paraphrase equivalents such as the ( a) examples in ( 6-150) and ( 6-151 )
for these examples:( 6-152 ) a. na-n-taukway-iray-Jlcut
3SG 0-3SG A-VIS-cry-RM PAST
'He cried over her.' ( looking at her body)AN EXPLICIT ACCOUNT OF YIMAS VERBAL MORPHOLOGY355b. na-n-pampay-iray-pra-k
3SG 0-3SG A-KIN-cry-toward-IRR
'He cried carrying her toward the village.'
The ideas behind the examples in (6-152) can only be expressed in this
way; alternatives with oblique nominals do not exist (although para­
phrases employing two clauses are possible). This casts grave doubt on
the productive syntactic analysis of valence increasing in Yimas. There
are no plausible underlying syntactic constructions from which the ex­
amples in (6-152) can be derived. Rather one must conclude that they
(and, by extension (6- 150b) and (6- 151b)) are base generated. Further,
because the sequence of valence affix plus verb root forms a single verb
stem, this base generation must be accomplished by morphological rules
and most likely accomplished in the lexicon.
Having established the morphological basis of such processes as va­
lence changing, it is now time to turn to a more detailed account of
the derivation of Yimas verb forms. This model of Yimas verbal mor­
phology means that the entire polysynthetic structure of a verb, with
all its elaborate morphological specifications, is produced by a complex,
ordered series of derivations. The morphological rules which accomplish
these derivations are located in a component of the lexicon. It will be the
task of the remainder of this section to elucidate explicitly the internal
structure of this derivational process in its various stages.
The starting point, of course, for all Yimas verbs is a verb root: these
are all entered separately in the lexicon. Let us represent a verb root
with the symbol Vo .
The next state is the derivation of verb stems from verb roots. The
verb stem is represented by V1. There are a number of processes which
derive verb stems, i.e., convert Yo to V 1 : reduplication, noun incorpora­
tion, and valence altering. These processes are themselves hierarchically
arranged. The most basic, i.e the one applied first, is reduplication.
Reduplication seems to be the most lexicalized of all derivational pro­
cesses: there are two bits of evidence to support this. First, there is a
special dissimilation rule that applies to reduplicated forms that does
not apply elsewhere in the grammar (rule (2-7)) . This removes the F
autosegment from a reduplicated segment, so that wul- 'put in water'
reduplicated is wurt-, not *wult-. This is a specialized phonological rule,
something to be expected for a highly lexicalized process. Second, Yi­
mas has some irregular reduplicated forms: ira- 'dance' reduplicated is
iranta-, not *irata- . This, again, would be expected of a highly lexi­
ealized process. So, applying reduplication to two representative verb
roots, we have the following derivations:356
(6-153)THE V ERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTURE
v1/ �REDREDVo\�a i'put in'/Vo\J/a k'break'arkarkapapiThis derivation can be stated as the lexical rule V 1 = (RED) + Vo .
The next stem-level derivational process is noun incorporation. As
mentioned in Section 6.2.5, this is a sporadic process which often re­
sults in idiomatic constructions, a feature diagnostic of a highly lexi­
calized process. The only productive type is incorporation of nominal­
ized adjectives. Diagrammatic examples of noun incorporation are given
below:

Combining reduplication and noun incorporation in one lexical rule, we
have V1 = (N) + (RED) + Vo .
Finally, we turn to the most common and most varied type of verb
stem derivation: valence alterations. All valence changing processes but
possessor raising and va- BEN are possible at the level of the verb stem.
A couple of examples illustrating valence changing inside serial verb
constructions (hence on the level of the verb stem) follow:

Valence altering affixes not uncommonly co-occur with the other two
derivational categories of the verb stem, reduplication and noun incor­
poration.","[368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"

and funded largely by the Australian Research Grants Scheme (Grant
A176/15655) , with some supplementary funding in 1985 from the Fac­
ulties Research Fund of the Australian National University. The goal of
the project was a complete study of the Yimas language, its grammar
and lexicon, the social and cultural contexts of the use of the language,
its history and genetic relations, and its interactions with neighboring
languages. Some of the results of this project have been reported in pre­
vious works, notably Foley (1986, 1988), but this book represents the
most complete document on the language to date. Still to come are a
Yimas dictionary and a volume of traditional legends, presented in Yi­
mas with Tok Pisin and English translations. Further, the result of the
Yimas language project will play a central role in a long term research
project I have just commenced-a reconstruction of the prehistory of
the Sepik-Ramu basin, using largely linguistic data.
The following grammar is not written in any set theoretical frame­
work. I wanted the organization of the grammar to reflect the structure
of the language as closely as possible. Hence, I have deliberately chosen
to be eclectic, choosing various ideas from different theories when these
Heem to elucidate the structure of the language best. Thus, the reader
will find that the phonology is largely cast in an autosegmental frame­
work, while the syntax reflects a rather broad structuralist/functionalist
pmspective. Still, these frameworks are not rigidly adhered to, but are
adapted as needs be in order to make the grammar widely accessible.
This seemed to me to be the best approach, because this work is likely to
hP the only documentation ever of the grammar of the Yimas language,
and hence it is esset;1tial that it be intelligible to the widest possible au­
di«�nce. Those who find in the labyrinth of Yimas grammar, facts which
viiviiiPREFACEare confirmations (or disconfirmations! ) of their favorite linguistic hy­
potheses are welcome to make whatever use they like of this grammar
and restate it in whatever theoretical model they fancy.
This book is the last I will write at the Australian National Univer­
sity, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues
and the general staff of the University for their help and kindnesses over
the years, which have made my twelve years here such a pleasant time.
The conditions at the Australian National University must be among
the very best in the world, and whatever value the reader may find in
this work is due in no small part to the excellent support provided by
the University over the years.
For the completion of this work, I owe a great debt to several people.
The two most important are Mrs. Ellalene Seymour, who patiently and
uncomplainingly typed the manuscript from untidy handwritten drafts,
and Rosemary Butt, whose electronic wizardry made the correcting and
editing of the manuscript much less painful than it otherwise would have
been. Thanks also go to Val Lyons, who drew the maps.
Finally, a simple thanks is inadequate to express my debt to my main
language teacher Stephen Yakayapan Mambi and my other language
helpers at Yimas: Paul Api, Pius Taki, Marikin, Malkior Yumbwi, and
Bruno Yumbwi. It was their hard work and patience which made this
book possible. Finally, I hope the dedication of this book to the Yimas
people goes part of the way in repaying their kindness and trust in me
over the last ten years.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"
"166NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESAs the (c) example shows, the initial /n/ in the allomorph - nan is subject
to the rule of palatalization (rule (2-3)) following a segment carrying F
(the /1/ is only optionally subject to liquid strengthening (rule (2-5)).
Essentially, the allomorphic choice between - n and -nan is determined
by the following basic rule: use -n with singular forms and - nan with
non-singular forms. But this rule is subject to a number of irregularities
and complications. The dual is completely regular: all dual forms take
- nan. The variation between - n and - nan is not statable in strictly
phonological terms. Minimal pairs such as tktmtrm-nan chair V DL­
OBL versus arm-n water-OBL clearly show this to be the case. Rather,
as with many of the variants in Yimas morphology, the choice is governed
partly by morphological features and partly by phonological ones.
The plural forms are more complex. The allomorph - nan is used
with nouns whose plurals end in -i, and -n is found elsewhere. But
again there are exceptions. The plurals of classes VIII and IX, both of
which end in /t/ (i.e., - mpt and - ut) always take - nan, while the plurals
of other classes which end in /t/, like V and VII (e.g., -vkat and - mpat)
occur with -n.

shell VI PL-OBL 3SG 0-lSG A-cut-NIGHT-IRR

Note that the rule of palatalization (rule (2-3)) applies following the -i
plural, copying the F feature onto the initial /n/ of - nan and converting
/i/ to i, which of course being predictable, is not written. Another
example is given below:
ama-na-irm-n
b. !Ja!Jk-Jlan

The singular forms almost always take -n, but those ending in a
segment associated with F (i.e., /i/, jay/ or /1/) take - nan, as do nouns
ending in the other liquid, underlying /r/ (of course, realized as t in
word-final position and before /n/). Words ending in /n/ or /IJ/ alsoTABLE 4Yimas Noun Classes

pronouns.
When the A is first person and the 0 non-singular second person, only
the 0 is marked on the verb. This is in keeping with the rules observed
above with the positive verbs in Section 5.1.2. The negative number
suffix, if present, simply redundantly specifies the number of the 0.
(5-1 14) a. ta-IJkul-cpul-c-rm

'I didn't hit you two.'
b. kapa ta-kul-cpul-c-um
lDL NEG-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PL
'We two didn't hit you all.'
If the 0 is second person singular, the suppletive prefix mpan- 1A/2SG
0 is used, but no negative number suffix is allowed. The number of the
A can only be indicated through the use of an independent pronoun.
(5-115) a. ta-mpan-tpul
NEG- 1A/2SG 0-hit
'I didn't hit you.'
b. ipa ta-mpan-tpul
lPL NEG-1A/2SG 0-hit
'We didn't hit you. '
The latter example would be ungrammatical if the negative plural suffix
ump were attached.
Ditransitive verbs which code three participants on the verb through
pronominal affixes present the added complication in the negative of
determining which participant is to be realized as a suffix. In all cases
of ditransitive verbs with three pronominal affixes, it is the theme par­
ticipant which is suffixed in the negative. If the D participant is third
person and hence already a suffix, the theme suffix simply follows this.","[274, 275]"

This last example may present the very rare example of necessary rule
ordering in Yimas phonology. The rule of R spreading must precede
rule ( 4-21). Otherwise, the feature which triggers R spreading is deleted
before it is able to do so. An alternative to this rule ordering would
be to claim that the underlying forms of such words as tumpa already
contain the /u/ and that it is not the result of R spreading from the
following syllable. There is no obvious way to decide between these two
alternatives at this point; neither are completely satisfactory.
The adjectival/possessive agreement suffixes of class IX are closely
related to the noun inflections. They are as follows:
SG
DL
PL
-aw
-awl
-ut
The singular suffix is subject to both rules (4-21) and (4-22). Consider
these examples:
kpa-0
( 4-23) a. namtampara ama-na-0
foot IX SG 1SG-POSS-IX SG big-IX SG
'my small foot'
b. nuukwara ama-na-0
waca-k-wa
hand IX SG 1SG-POSS-IX SG small-IRR-IX SG
'my big hand'
When used with words ending in /a/, like ama-na- 'my' and kpa- 'big',
the singular agreement suffix is subject to rule (4-21), which reduces it
to -a. The resulting vowel cluster is then subject to the vowel truncation
rule (2-13) , resulting in what is, in essence, a 0 allomorph. The adjectival
verbs ending in the irrealis suffix -k, on the other hand, undergo rule ( 422) (as is typical of velars), converting - aw to - wa , as with 'small' in (423b). Examples with the dual and plural allomorphs are straightforward.
· --NOUN CLASSES157( 4-24) a. trukawl

knee IX DL lSG-POSS-IX DL bad-IRR-IX DL

b. kampra!Jkut
urkpwica-k-ut
cockroach IX PL black-IRR-IX PL
'black cockroaches'
The loss of the initial fa/ in the dual agreement suffix here reflects the
vowel truncation rule (2-13).
The verbal prefixal class marker for this class is derived similarly
to those of classes IV through VIII. As in class IV, the singular adjec­
tive/possessive agreement suffix of the form -VC is metathesized to form
the verbal prefixal class marker. So -aw becomes wa-. The singular is
simply wa- (class IX marker) plus 0 (singular), but the dual and plural
are the unexpected forms given below:
PL
SG
DL
wila- ""' ulaurawaIf the dual and plural were formed regularly, one would expect * wa-l­
a and * wa-y-a- respectively, but they clearly are not, and there is no
obvious explanation for the aberrations. The two dual forms are in free
variation. Examples involving these verbal prefixes follow:
(4-25) a. namtamparawl wila-na-kkt-n
foot IX DL
IX DL S-DEF-hurt-PRES
'(My) feet hurt.'
wa-JJa-kwalca-t
b. !Jarwa
penis IX SG IX SG S-lSG D-rise-PERF
'I have an erection.'
The numerals and deictics are formed in the usual way: adjectival/
possessive suffixes attach to 'one', 'four', and the near distal deictic, and
verbal prefixes attach to 'two', 'three', and the proximal and far distal
deictics.
Numerals:
'three'
wu-ramnawt
'one'
mpa-0
ma-ul+ ama-ul 'four'
wu-rpal 'two'
The forms for 'two' and 'three' are irregular in that the prefix is wu­
mther than the expected * wa-; this wu- is undoubtedly related to the
dual verbal prefix wila- ""' ula-. The form for 'one' is the result of rule
(4-21) and the vowel truncation rule (2-13).","[171, 172, 173]"
"204BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYHere al 'machete' functions as the instrument responsible for the cutting.
There is no responsible agent mentioned in the sentence, so it is the
instrument which is coded by the A prefix. Note that although the 0
is animate and the A inanimate, the A still occurs closer to the verb
stem, in the higher ranking position. Now consider the following two
examples:
kay
(5-23) a. arm i-mpu-tal-c1Jknt-t
water VIII SG 0-3PL A-CAUS-heavy-PERF canoe VIII SG
'The water made the canoe heavy. '
b. ikn
antki
smoke V SG thatch VII PL
ya-n-tar-urkpwica-t
VII PL 0-3SG A-CADS-blacken-PERF
'The smoke blackened the roof (thatch) .'
It is worth pointing out that arm 'water', which constitutes a noun
class by itself and is normally referenced by an S/0 verbal prefix ima-,
is treated as a plural noun when an A argument and indicated by the
third plural A prefix mpu-. In both examples, the verbs are overtly
causative, as expressed by the causative prefix tar- ""' tal- (see Section
6.2.3.1.3), and the inanimate nouns which express the forces functioning
as the causes are referenced by the corresponding A prefix. While con­
structions like those of (5-23) are certainly grammatical in Yimas, such
constructions with an overtly causativized verb have an alternative in
which the verb is intransitive and associated with an S argument express­
ing the entity undergoing the change of state and an oblique noun for the
causing force. So compare the examples in (5-23) to the corresponding
intransitive examples in (5-24) :
(5-24) a. arm-n
kay
i-cJJknt-t
water-OBL canoe VIII SG VIII SG S-heavy-PERF
'The canoe got heavy from the water.'
b. ikn-an
antki
ya-urkpwica-t
smoke-OBL thatch VII PL VII PL S-blacken-PERF
'The roof (sago thatch) blackened from the smoke.'
These later constructions obviate the need to code the inanimate causers
with an A prefix, instead marking them as peripheral nouns with the
oblique suffix. The constructions of both (5-23) and (5-24) are equally
grammatical and there is no significant meaning difference between
them, although perhaps the examples (5-23) , in which the causing func­
tions are marked as A, reflect a more direct causation, focusing on theTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS205causer, rather than the change of state. This seems to be true of the
corresponding English translations.
Having now discussed in some detail verbs associated with two third
person participants, let me turn to the next most straightforward cases,
those with one third person participant and one first or second person
participant. According to principle one, the first or second person par­
ticipant outranks the third person, so it must occupy the position closer
to the verb stem. Now the second principle must be considered: A out­
ranks 0 for third person, but 0 outranks A for first and second. So if
the A is third person and the 0 is first or second, there is no conflict
between the two principles: the first or second person 0 will occupy the
ranking position closer to the verb stem, and the third person A will
precede it.

3SG A-lPL O-see
'He saw us. '
p-ua-kra-t
d . naukm
grass VII SG VII SG A- lSG 0-cut-PERF
'The grass cut me.'
Note that because of the constraints on the form of the third person
prefixes imposed by linear order, the third person A's in these examples
actually appear in the form for S and 0, the only permissible form for
initial position. Also, because the A prefix must occur initially in an
S /0 form, it is now possible to indicate the noun class of inanimate
A 's as in (5-25d). This is not possible for verbs with two third person
participants, in which the A prefix must be the A form in the ranking
H«'cond position (5-23) .
If the A is first or second person and the 0 third person, the two
principles for ranking are now in conflict with each other. In this situ­
ation, principle one provides, and the first or second person participant
occupies the higher ranked position, even though it is an A (compare
t.lwse with examples in (5-25)) :
( fJ-26) a . pu-ka-tay

3DL 0-2DL A-see
'You two saw them two.'
c. na-kay-cay
3SG 0-lPL A-see
'We saw him. '
Now let us turn to the most complex cases, verbs with a first person
participant and a second person participant. By principle one, the first
person participant, will always outrank the second. But principle two
poses a potential dilemma. Remember that for first and second persons
0 outranks A, so that if the first person participant is the 0 and the
second person the A, there is no problem: both principles select the
same participant, the first person 0, as the higher ranked. If, on the
other hand, the first person participant is the A and the second person
the 0, the two principles are in conflict: principle one selects the first
person A as the higher ranked, while principle two chooses the second
person 0. As we shall see below, Yimas has evolved a clever solution to
this dilemma.
Let us start with the simpler of the two cases, that in which the
principles are in harmony. These involve a first person 0 and a second
person A. By both principles the higher ranked will be the first person
0, and therefore the prefix for this participant will occur closer to the
verb stem:
( 5-27) a. ma-IJa-tay
2SG A-lSG O-see
'You saw me. '
b . ma-kra-tay
2SG A-lPL O-see
'You saw us.'
c. kapwa-IJkra-tay
2DL A-lDL O-see
'You two saw us two.'
d. ipwa-IJkra-tay
2PL A-lDL O-see
'You all saw us two.'
Because the second person A is the lower ranked participant, it would
have to appear in the verb-initial position. But as we have seen with
third person prefixes, there is a constraint which prohibits the A prefix
forms from appearing there. Hence, the second person A is actually real­
ized with the S prefix form, as with the third person examples discussed
earlier. For example, in ( 5-27a,b) , the second singular A is marked byTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS207the prefix ma- 2SG S. The same constraint causes the S prefixes for non­
singular second person participants to be employed in examples (5-27c,
d), although in these cases it is a little more difficult to be sure that
there are in fact bound S prefixes, for they are completely homophonous
with the independent pronouns. Evidence that there are in fact bound
prefixes will be presented below in Section 5.1.4 on paucal marking and
again in Section 5.2.2.1 on negation.
Let us now look at the case in which the two principles fixing the lin­
ear order of A and 0 prefixes are in conflict, those involving a first person
A and a second person 0. By principle one, the first person A should
be the higher ranked, but by principle two, the second person 0 should
be. For a second person singular 0, the language avoids the problem en­
tirely by having a suppletive portmanteau morpheme mpan- ""' kampan­
(whose allomorph occurs word-initially) which is used whenever a first
person A of any number acts on a second singular 0.
(5-28) a. kampan-tay

'I saw you.'
b. kapa kampan-tay
lDL 1A/2SG O-see
'We two saw you.'
c. ipa kampan-tay
lPL 1A/2SG O-see
'We saw you.'
To distinguish the number of the first person A, an independent pronoun
must be used, as in (5-28b, c). Without a pronoun, first singular is
assumed, unless context determines otherwise (5-28a).
If the second person 0 is non-singular, the language copes by simply
prohibiting both participants from being realized as bound prefixes to
the verb. The second person 0 occupies the ranking position of the prefix
to the verb, and the first person A must appear as an independent pro­
noun. These independent pronouns are, of course, again homophonous
with the corresponding S prefixes (as with the examples of the non­
H ingular second person A's in (5-27c, d), but in this situation the first
JH�rson A's are flatly prohibited from being bound to the verb).

The Yimas language has never been studied before, so there was no
material to consult before I began work on it. The first field trip was
undertaken in 1977 and lasted seven months. Since then there have been
five additional shorter trips: 1978-9 (2 months) , 1981-2 (2 months),
1983-4 (2 months) , 1985-6 (3 months) , and 1988 (1 month) . The total
time spent in the field amounted to 17 months. The great bulk of that
time was devoted to the in depth study of Yimas, but the study of the
neighboring language Arafundi and other languages of the Lower Sepik
family for comparative purposes was also pursued.
By far the greater part of the language work in Yimas was conducted
with a single very fine informant, Stephen Yakayapan Mambi, a man now
( 1988) in his late thirties. He is far and away the best speaker of Yimas
in his age group, and indeed, has a richer and more sophisticated knowl­
edge of the language than most men twenty years his senior. He is also
exceptionally well versed in traditional Yimas lore and legends. This is
all due to the upbringing by his father, a very traditional man, already
in his late forties at the time of Stephen's birth, who had reached adult­
hood in the precontact time and spoke only a rudimentary Tok Pisin.
Stephen was very close to his father and as a child spent much of his
time with him, in contrast to the typical pattern of young Yimas boys,
who congregate in age groups and spend most of their time with each
other. As a result of his father's tutelage, Stephen has an exceptional
knowledge of his language and culture, and is sometimes referred to in
the village by people his age and younger as tumbuna man, literally
'ancestor man' , one familiar with the traditional life.
My other informants were two men now (1988) in their late twenties,
Pius Tapi and Paul A pi. They were the major sources of my information
on the somewhat regularized and simplified Yimas of younger speakers.
Pius and I worked together in my first 3 months of field work in 1977.
When I first went to Yimas, I could not speak Tok Pisin, and I neededSOURCES FOR THIS STUDY35to work with someone who spoke English. Pius had completed six years
of English language medium schooling and was very helpful in this tran­
sitional period. My sessions with Paul Api were in 1984. Paul's special
gift is the ability to elucidate the meanings of complex constructions
and propose alternative examples (a task Stephen Mambi has little pa­
tience with) . He is also the source of much of my data on changes in the
language among younger speakers.
There were a few other people, mostly older men in their fifties,
that I worked with sporadically. My sessions with them were almost
exclusively concerned with the recording and transcribing of traditional
legends. The man who stands out in this group is Bruno Yumbwi, who
taught me many valuable legends (really oral history), such as the story
concerning the migration of the Chambri and Murik. He is also the
source of my information on pidginized Yimas, the highly simplified and
conventionalized jargon derived from Yimas used in trading contacts
with the Arafundi speaking villages upriver (Foley 1988).
Most of the data in this grammar comes from spontaneous spoken
texts, narratives, conversations, or expository prose. Some examples
come from elicitation sessions, but these have all been carefully and
doubly checked with informants, as have even those coming from spon­
taneous texts. The texts were recorded on tape and then transcribed
with the informant, who constantly monitored my oral repetition of what
was on the tape. I also got good data from speaking with the villagers
in Yimas, as they would quite gleefully correct me whenever I made a
mistake! Elicitation sessions were mostly restricted to the collection of
paradigms and the like, but there were many of these, for, as the reader
will soon discover, the structure of the language required it.
The language being described here is essentially that of Yimas speak­
ers in their late thirties and older in 1988. Younger speakers show signif­
icant simplifications and regularizations in their speech, many of which
will be noted where relevant in the grammar. Very young speakers, un­
der seven, rarely know the language at all, having learned Tok Pisin as
their first language. It remains to be seen whether they will learn Yimas
later, but the long term prognosis for the language is not good. It is
very likely that in 30 years or so it would not prove possible to write a
grammar of the language described herein.","[49, 50, 51]"

-The Yimas Language
of New Guinea1The Language and Its Speakers1 . 1 Linguistic Type
Yimas belongs to the grouping of languages spoken in the Pacific known
as Papuan languages .. Languages of the New Guinea area are generally
divided into two large groupings: Austronesian languages and Papuan
languages. The Austronesian languages all belong to the far-flung Aus­
tronesian language family, stretching east to west from Southeast Asia
to Hawaii, and north to south from Formosa to New Zealand. Most of
the roughly 250 Austronesian languages of the New Guinea area (and
all of those in Papua New Guinea) belong to a single subgroup of the
family known as the Oceanic subgroup.
Papuan languages are quite different in this respect. The 750 or so
Papuan languages do not constitute a single, genetically unified language
family, but rather are organized into about sixty different language fam­
ilies averaging ten member languages each. With much more careful and
detailed comparative work, some of these language families will undoubt­
edly be combined into larger genetic groupings, as the Celtic, Germanic,
and Slavic language families among others have been combined to form
the Indo-European language family. Wurm (1982) presents some hy­
potheses in this direction, but at this point nearly all of these need to
be verified by careful comparative work.
With so many Papuan language families composed of so many dis­
tinct languages, it is very difficult to describe what a 'typical' Papuan
language is, as all generalizations will be contradicted by one language
or indeed one language family. Nonetheless, I attempted just this in
Foley 1986, and I will summarize here how Yimas fits with the charac­
terizations of Papuan languages proposed in that work. Yimas is one
of six member languages of the Lower Sepik family (see Section 1 .4 for
more discussion of the family, as well as Foley 1986, 214-29). As with
12THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSthe other languages of the family, it is morphologically agglutinative,
employing both prefixes and suffixes. Word order is highly variable and
quite free, although some other languages in the family have a weak
preference for Subject/ Object/Verb.
The phonological inventory of Yimas is small, even by the stan­
dards of Papuan languages, having only 12 consonants and 4 vowels.
The phonology exhibits many features typical of Sepik area languages.
There are no fricative phonemes; [s] is just an allophonic realization of
the voiceless palatal stop / c /. The language distinguishes four places of
articulation: bilabial, dental, palatal, and velar, with a corresponding
voiceless stop and nasal in each position. There is no voiced/voiceless
distinction for stops, the voiced stops being allophonic realizations of the
voiceless stops in certain positions, such as following nasals. Unusually
for a Papuan language, Yimas has an r/l distinction, but the /1/ is always
palatal(ized) , i.e., [lY] or [.A] , and the /r/ is always dental-alveolar, to a
large extent varying freely between [l] and [r] as phonetic realizations.
The vocalic system is typically-one might say prototypically-Sepik.
There is a dearth of vowel phonemes, both abstractly and as the seg­
mental phonemes of particular words. Many words lack underlying vowel
phonemes altogether, and the string of underlying consonants is broken
up in phonetic realization by epenthetic vowels inserted by a phonolog­
ical rule. The only clear unambiguous underlying vowel in the language
is the low central vowel fa/. The three high vowels /i, i, uj are often the
result of vowel epenthesis, the /i/ almost invariably so. The semivowels
jyj and jwj, especially the latter, interact closely with the phonological
rules involving vowels, such that their phonetic realization is often the
result of these rules. Stress is predictable and generally occurs initially.
Yimas has two major word classes, noun and verb. In addition to
these, there are eight minor categories: adjective, quantifier, locational,
temporal, pronoun, deictic, conjunction, and interjection. There are
only three true adjectives in Yimas; other roots corresponding to adjec­
tives in English belong to the major classes of verb and noun. Quantifiers
must be treated as a separate word class from adjectives in Yimas due to
their highly divergent morphology. Locationals and temporals are two
adverb-like parts of speech, expressing the spatial and temporal orien­
tations of events. They both share some of the features of nouns, such
as the occasional ability to pluralize. The number distinctions of Yimas
pronouns are much richer than in most other Papuan languages. In ad­
dition to the usual three persons, Yimas pronouns distinguish four num­
bers: singular, dual, paucal (a few), and plural (more than a few). De­
ictics exhibit a three-way distinction: place near the speaker, place near
the addressee, and place near neither of these. There are over sixty ofLINGUISTIC TYPE3these deictic forms; besides deictic distance, they distinguish noun class
and number of the nominal designating the object whose position they
describe. Like most Papuan languages, Yimas has a very restricted set
of conjunctions (some languages in the central highlands of Papua New
Guinea lack them entirely). There are no subordinating conjunctions
and only two coordinating conjunctions, equivalent to 'and' and 'but'.
Nouns in Yimas are characterized by being divided into ten major
classes, plus a few idiosyncratic classes. The criteria for assignment to
noun class are both semantic and phonological. Nouns are obligato­
rily inflected for three numbers (singular, dual, and plural) , with the
morphemes indicating number highly variable according to noun class.
Suppletion of the noun stem in the plural form is common. The only
other inflection available to nouns is case, and for this there is only a
single oblique case inflection, which marks nouns functioning in an in­
strumental or locative role. Possession is marked by a particle postposed
to the possessor.
Verbs are the most morphologically complex word class in Yimas,
and they are highly so; about half of this grammar is devoted to verb
morphology. Because of this complexity, Yimas can properly be char­
acterized as an agglutinative polysynthetic language, equal in most re­
spects to the much discussed polysynthetic languages of the Americas.
The verb can occur with many prefixes and suffixes, with the former pre­
dominating. The suffixes largely express notions of tense, aspect, and
mood. The language is very rich in this area, marking, for example, eight
distinct tenses. There are five potentially filled suffixal slots to the verb.
The prefixes are more numerous, with eight potentially filled positions.
The prefixes express notions like modality; agreement for noun class, per­
son and number of core nominals like subject, direct object, and indirect
object (this information can also be expressed by suffixes in some envi­
ronments) ; adverbial notions like place, direction, duration and manner;
and finally, valence alternations to the verb like reciprocal formation,
causativization and applicative verb formation (see Comrie 1985). An­
other common feature of verbs is verb compounding, or serialization.
This is done at the word level, as shown by the fact that the whole set
of verbal prefixes and suffixes flank these compounded verbal forms.
Pronouns in Yimas are not inflected. True pronouns only exist for
first- and second-persons; the so-called third-person independent pro­
nouns are actually deictics, and distinguish noun class and number.
Pronouns are actually rather infrequently used in Yimas, for the simple
reason that the verb has pronominal affixes for the subject, direct object,
and indirect object of the clauses. These affixes exhibit a very complex
1wrson-bascd split for their case-marking schema. First- and second-4THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSperson forms follow an underlying nominative/accusative pattern, and
third-person forms, something like an ergative/absolutive one.
Word order in Yimas is remarkably free, even in comparison to
the relative freedom exhibited by other Papuan languages. Within the
clause, there is no set word order pattern at all (in fact, the majority
of clauses consist of just a verb, so word order is not much of a ques­
tion in these cases anyway) . The verb has a slight tendency to occur
last in a pragmatically unmarked context, with the preceding nominals
in any order, but it is common for a nominal to occur after the verb
with a slightly marked pragmatic force. Word order in Yimas is so free
that noun phrases need not even form a constituent. Yimas exhibits
the 'scrambled' pattern of noun phrases, well known from Australian
languages, in which a noun and its modifiers can be separated from one
another within the clause. In these cases, the modifiers obligatorily take
concord affixes for the noun class and number of the noun they modify.
Yimas contrasts with many other Papuan languages in making less
extensive use of clause chaining (Foley 1986). Yimas completely lacks a
productive morphological system of switch reference: the same form of a
medial dependent verb form can be used before another verb regardless
of whether they share the same subject or not. The most common type
of clause linkage in Yimas involves nominalization, both finite and non­
finite. Finite nominalizations in Yimas correspond to relative and ad­
verbial subordinate clauses in more familiar languages, while non-finite
nominalizations are like infinitive complements and gerunds. Yimas can
also link clauses through coordination, by simple juxtaposition, or by
using one of its two conjunctions.
Yimas discourse strikes an English speaker as very dense. Because
of the pronominal agreement affixes, overt nominals are rare and carry
strong contrastive emphasis. This results in the text often consisting
of little more than verbs over long stretches. The highly incorporating,
agglutinative morphology of the verb further contributes to this impres­
sion of density: much information is carried by the bound affixes of the
verb, in contrast to the independent words of a language like English.
This can put heavy processing loads on the hearer in trying to decipher
a verb consisting of ten morphemes.
Yimas is spoken in two villages, totaling about 250 people. One vil­
lage is the original village site, and the other has only recently hived
off from that village, since 1970 or so. There is constant traveling back
and forth between the two villages, most people spending some time
each year in both. Only a small minority live exclusively in one or the
other village, but even these make day trips between the two, which are
separated by about 15 km. Because of this situation, there is no geo-LINGUISTIC TYPE5graphically based dialect differentiation in the Yimas language. There is,
however, significant socially based differentiation according to age. All
speakers under 40 have grown up bilingual in Tok Pisin, and this has
influenced their Yimas to a greater or lesser extent. Even older male
speakers who grew up monolingually in Yimas and learned Tok Pisin
while serving stints as recruited plantation labor show this influence to
some extent. Older women speak the least affected Yimas and show the
lowest degree of fluency in Tok Pisin.
Tok Pisin is the prestige language and its influence on Yimas has two
effects. First, Tok Pisin words are borrowed into Yimas. This borrowing
may be so heavy that the speaker's talk may resemble a code switching­
like discourse, containing snatches of Yimas followed by Tok Pisin. In
other cases, Tok Pisin forms are borrowed into what is otherwise pure
Yimas. These may be nativized to such an extent that speakers are
unaware of the words' ancestry. Second, the very complex morphology
of Yimas is subject to simplification. Verbs have fewer morpheme slots
filled, and irregular and suppletive forms are regularized. In some cases
these irregular forms may be lost altogether. For example, almost no
speakers under 40 can completely control the highly complex and irreg­
ular numeral system. In daily use these are replaced by the Tok Pisin
numbers. The whole impression of the Yimas of younger speakers is its
simplicity and regularity relative to the highly complex and irregular
language of older (especially female) speakers. The language described
principally in this grammar is of men now in their late thirties, who
grew up in an almost purely monolingual Yimas environment, and who
speak a relatively rich and elaborate version of the language. Regular­
izations and changes in the speech of younger speakers will be noted
when relevant.
The influence of Tok Pisin on Yimas is now reaching its logical out­
come among the very young. Many young children in the Yimas commu­
nities, especially those under seven years of age, are not learning Yimas
at all and are certainly growing up with Tok Pisin as their first language.
Whether they will learn Yimas as a second language around ten years
of age or slightly older is not clear at the moment, but this seems un­
likely, given the status attached to Tok Pisin (Foley 1986, 27-8) and the
great morphological complexity of Yimas, which puts a great burden on
simple memory in language acquisition. In traditional times, the single
greatest intellectual task facing a Yimas child was probably learning his
language. But now with schooling and other Western accoutrements,
there are other claims on his time. It is perhaps too early to say that
the Yimas language is dying, but it must be admitted that the prognosis
is not good.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]"
