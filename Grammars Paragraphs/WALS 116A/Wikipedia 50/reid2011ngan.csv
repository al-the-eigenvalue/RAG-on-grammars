Yityi!- differs in word class status from the other interrogatives in

‘say/do' auxiliary (recall that complex verbs employing this auxiliary have
their verb root ordered before the auxiliary). Where tyagani asks ‘what ?' of

HOW ABOUT IT ?
The particle ngunu forms a question that asks ‘how about it?’ with
respect to some given proposition. Its characteristic use is in polite speech,
seeking information. The usage of ngunu as an interjection is noted in 7.11.

"Contrastively, the dynamic simple verbs allowed for a more generalinterpretation of movement about the place, without any implication that
the activity in question is necessarily in progress at all times. Given the
requirement of unchanged stance, stative verbs describe temporary states
whereas dynamic simple verbs have an association with semi-permanent
states through their habitual and iterative readings.
This opposition
between transitory and permanent perspectives provided by the distinction
between stative and dynamic simple verbs, is also exploited in their copula
functions. Examples 4-61 and 4-62 above both have 'sit' marking transient
existential states. Compare them with the permanent perspective conveyedby the dynamic simple verb ‘go’ in existential function, in 4-63.

collecting ochres/firewood with some site-mapping, fulfilling Robert's
custodial role in certain estates, and the odd bit of fishing. Patrick Tyabada
frequently accompanied us on these trips, contributing his own stories and
general hilarity. While the bulk of my NgW data comes from a small
number of informants, I have regularly tested its acceptability within the
wider community of NgW speakers (see acknowledgements).
Most of the Peppi community took an interest in my developing
language skills, making an effort to avoid speaking English to me, and
randomly testing my knowledge of words and expressions.
My more
spectacular errors (quite unrepeatable) featured regularly in community
gossip. This level of interest, though occasionally embarrassing, greatly
improved my conversational fluency in NgW.
From the start Ngan'gityemerri people have always been keen to
have their language ‘written down’.
Although I have always been
encouraged by this expression of support, initially I felt uneasy about what
seemed to be two unstated inferences: that the language would somehow be
saved by this process, and secondly that my thesis would constitute some
sort of language resource that they could refer to like a dictionary. My
explanations of what my thesis would and would not be, produced varied
responses. Some people were plainly puzzled; if I was not producing a
resource for native speakers, or drills for language learners, just who would
use this book ? Others were quick to point out my obligations to make
available those products of my work that were of more immediate use, texts
and wordlists particularly.
At Peppimenarti I was actively encouraged to work in the school, and
together with Terry Sam began a school-based language program. Although
we did develop and teach the orthography used here and commence
wordlists for each child, the main focus of this program has always been on
different ‘languages’.
Within a single ‘language’, people listening to a narrative will, in
whisper, query the acceptability of unusual auxiliary(+bodypart)+verbroot combinations,
and derisively hoot at erroneous or implausible ones. Within this context, my discussions
with informants about the acceptability of particular grammatical constructions, was notconsidered particularly odd by them. Of course the responses I got were subject to all sorts of
variables, and where these wereuncontrollable, I have avoided relying on this material atall, unless natural contexts could verify them. So while much of the description contained in
this thesis is based on the grammar of narrative text, and most of the examples cited are
taken from recorded texts, my understanding of such issues as bodypart incorporation and
auxiliary semantics in particular, owes a significant debt to the process of solid formal
elicitation.","[48, 49, 50]"
"The notion of ‘accompaniment, as marked by -werre, differs from the
notion of ‘instrumental use’, marked by -ninggi-, in terms of the degree to
which the entity in question falls within subject control. In contrast to
comitative NPs, the prototypical instrumental NP is inanimate, devoid of
self-will, and in human hands is totally manipulable. In 6.1.2 we saw that
speech, tools, weapons etc, are the best examples of instruments, and are the
kinds of entities that will be always marked in that role with -ninggi.
However, between self-willed humans that one accompanies, on the
one hand, and inanimate objects that one uses, on the other, there is a grey
area of ‘non-human animates' and ‘not-very-manipulable inanimates'which can be variously viewed as filling either comitative or instrumental
roles. Thus, in view of their self-will, horses are treated as comitative in
6-29. Likewise in 6-30, an inanimate raft is treated as a comitative, in view
of its limited manoeuvrability (especially in contrast with the handheld
steering pole). Note though that in both these examples the horse or raft
could quite acceptably be viewed as functioning in an instrumental role and
correspondingly marked with -ninggi.
6-31 below demonstrates the
acceptability of variously viewing dogs in an accompanying role, or in aninstrumental role.

I couldn't hold on.
Among the verbs that are formulated with the ‘hands’ auxiliary,
there is a subset of verbs that have 3rd singular, but non-recoverable, agents
and cross-reference their patients as direct objects. Consider the examples
below.

The obvious question to ask of these impersonal verbs is 'why are
they constructed with the ‘hands’ auxiliary?’. Certainly, despite the above
noted, and independently establishable, psychological reality of the semantic
components of auxiliaries, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that
Ngan'gityemerri speakers view verbs such as 'to be (made) angry’ in terms
of any literal notion of ‘grasping hands'. While speakers will readily

ParticlesParticles differ from enclitics in being independent freeform
phonological words, and generally occurring clause-initially. Otherwise they
share broadly similar semantic functions to the enclitics discussed in the
preceding chapter. Wilkins (1989:347) has drawn attention to the ‘significant
degree of agreement between the stocks of meanings encoded through the
particle/clitic grouping’ in Australian languages generally. Most of the
particles discussed here have scope over an entire clausal proposition. The
three forms examined in 7.10 have the function of conjoining nouns and
clauses under certain, fairly limited, conditions. Particles cannot take any
form of inflection. 7.11 lists the class of interjections, which differ from
particles in constituting complete utterances on their own.

identity of some nameable entity (cf. yityi in 9.3.4), and presupposes no
knowledge about that entity (cf. tyen- in 9.3.4).

humans and non-humans is then quite rigid. The response to a kenequestion will always identify a particular person.","[414, 415]"

1.5.3 Approach to Grammar Writing
My approach to writing a grammar of Ngan'gityemerri falls fairly
squarely within the traditions of what Wilkins (1989:58) has referred to as
‘The ANU School of Australian Grammatical Description’. This tradition
places a high priority on the use of descriptive practices that best reflect the
linguistic system in question, and are sensitive to the cultural context of its
usage. Grammars written within this tradition are highly eclectic in their
use of linguistic theory, drawing on whatever grammatical tools best
achieve these descriptive aims, without being overly concerned about, as
Evans (1985:xii) puts it, ""whether they all come from the same toolkit"".
Writers within this tradition employ, and acknowledge their use of,
whatever theories best handle the particular aspect of the language they are
describing. At the same time they are wary of 'fad’ theoretical terminology,
believing that a grammatical description written in the most straightforward
language and containing a large number of natural language examples will
best allow the reader to judge the accuracy and internal consistency of the
description.
I began this description of Ngan’gityemerri with the intention of
providing a full reference grammar of the language. I have been forced to
reduce the scope of this work by the realisation that languages having such
morphological density as this one does, cannot be adequately treated within
the thesis wordlength limitations imposed by the university. This thesis
cannot really be called a ‘grammar’, for it does not adequately cover some
aspects of the language, and others not at all. I have given fairly detailed
descriptions of the phonology and nominal and verbal morphology. As this
is a language in which the verb is “where the action is"", I have further
chosen to explore two of the most interesting aspects of the verb; the
incorporation of bodypart terms into the verbal complex, and the semantics
of the auxiliary verbs.
1.6Previous work on Ngan'gityemerri
rha
a
Gerhardt Laves was the first linguist to work on Ngan'gityemerri. In
1931 he collected some 200 pages of vocabulary, auxiliary paradigms,
grammatical notes and (largely untranscribed) texts, in Ngan'gimerri, the
speech variety of the now extinct rak-Merren patri-line. Laves returned tothe USA later that year, and appears not to have published anything from
his Australian data. His works, including detailed studies of Matngela,
Karriyarri, Kumbaingir and Nyungar, remained in the basement of the
library of the University of Chicago until 1985 when Mark Francillon
brought them to the notice of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Studies (then AIAS), who obtained copies in the
following year.
Of all the previous work on Ngan'gityemerri, this is by far the most
exciting, both for the quality of the analysis, and the diachronic evidence it
provides for changes within the Ngan'gityemerri verb structure (see Reid, to
appear). Laves had a good ear and a reasonable grasp of the phonology. He
never really came to grips with the nature of the stop contrast, but had the
presence of mind to keep his ..anscriptions phonetically oriented rather
than risk phonemic under-differentiation.
His segmentation of,
particularly, the partially synthetic verbal morphology was quite perceptive,
even to the extent that he was able to distinguish between complex strings of
morphology that happened to have the same surface form.
Laves' fieldnotes are the only previous work that has made any
significant contribution to this thesis.
Arthur CapellCapell collected some undated fieldnotes on what is probably
Ngan'gimerri, but may be Ngan'giwumirri.
These have never been
published and delays in the organisation of Capell's literary estate have
regrettably prevented me from seeing his work.
Darrell Tryon
As part of his survey of the ‘Daly Family Languages’, Tryon collected
NgK and NgW data during six month fieldtrips in 1967 and 1969. This work
was primarily aimed at a lexico-statistic classification of these languages, but
Tryon also provided the first basic description of the phonology, nominal
morphology, noun classification, verbal morphology and auxiliary classes.
Tryon's work on NgK and NgW is presented in Tryon 1968, 1970 and 1974.","[50, 51, 52]"
"2.1.3.2 Realisation of Obstruent Phonemes/p/ -The bilabial stop [p"") is always voiceless, aspirated and longwith no variation in closure type./b/ -The bilabial stop [b] is always voiced and unaspirated, and is
consistently shorter than the voiceless stop. However it exploits
durational difference to a far lesser degree than is found for
other articulator types (see 2.2.2). /b/ shows less fluctuation in
closure type than do the other voiced stops, being always fully
stopped.
is a bilabial fricative [9], lightly spread and with a small degree
of lip tension. Observation of speakers' lip movement shows
this sound to be truly bilabial, in that the teeth are not visible
and the upper and lower lips are aligned and make even
contact. However this sound has some of the turbulent quality
(auditory correlate of energy higher in the spectrum) that is
normally associated with labiodental articulation. The
presence of this turbulence suggests that the lip spread and
tension pulls the top lip sufficiently tightly against the upper
teeth that they act as joint articulators in opposing the bottom
lip. Even if the upper teeth do not actually come into contact
with the lower lip, they at least approach it closely enough to
generate wake turbulence. Among the younger speakers of
Ngan'gityemerri, (who have been exposed to a considerable
amount of Standard English through their schooling and, more
recently, through television), this fricative is usually realised as
a true labiodental [f].
As has been noted for all other Australian languages that have
both a stop contrast and fricatives, the contrast does not extend
to the fricatives (Dixon 1980:215). /f/ is always voiceless
initially, and varies between voiced and voiceless when
intervocalic or post-liquid. /f/ only occurs post-nasally across a
morpheme boundary in which environment it remains
voiceless.

(werge] ~[werBe)This tendency towards voicing assimilation (assuming [9] to be
the unmarked allophone), is much stronger in
Ngan'giwumirri than it is in Ngan’gikurunggurr. A text count
of word medial /f/ indicates about 80% are voiced in
Ngan'giwumirri, compared with only about 15% in
Ngan'gikurunggurr. Although this variation in the degree of
glottal pulsing through the approximation duration of medial
/£/ is biased differently in each dialect, it is still ‘free’ variation
in the sense that it is non-contrastive within the phonological
system of each dialect’.
Finally, a very minor allophone, a voiceless bilabial fricative
with labiodorsal secondary articulation [$”], has been recorded
as a free variant of word initial [] in a single word only.
2-19fa(K)-beeswax[$a] ~ [$a]3We can further observe a type of ‘fixed’ variation, whereby certain cognate lexemes areinvariably realised

ash, dust/f/inThese lexemes (and certain others) seem to be employed as language identificatory
markers; that is, the minor phonetic differences between them are strictly and invariablymaintained as evidence of the separate identities of the two groups, usually at other levels
(eg. political). In discussion of these words, speakers will carefully point out that “we say it
this way, but that other mob say it this way"". So despite the non-contrastive nature of thefeature tvoice among fricatives within the phonological systems of each of these languages,
the same feature is employed cross-dialectically, within a subset of the lexicon at least, to
flag linguistic identification. How, within the scope of the general lexicon, certain lexemes
come to be employed in this manner remains a question for further study. Note though that
these kinds of examples nicely illustrate Labov's observation that there is really no such
thing as free variation, if social and stylistic variables are considered to constitute part of
the conditioning environment.","[64, 65, 66]"

Examples are structured as four lines. The first line is the
Ngan'gityemerri sentence/word in bold script. Loanwords are treated in
one of two ways. English loans which essentially retain their English
phonemicisation and meaning are given in the first line of examples in
plain rather than bold script, to denote their status as loan words (or in some
cases, code-switching). Loans from English which have been phonemicised
into Ngan'gityemerri, or have acquired new or extended meanings as
loanwords are given in bold script and provided with an interlinear gloss on
lines two and three (i.e. in accordance with Ngan'gityemerri speakers’
perception of such words, I have treated them as ‘proper NgK or NgW’).
The second and third lines of examples, in italic script, provide an
interlinear gloss. I've found the use of two lines necessary simply because of
the morphological density of the verb in particular. Lines 2 and 3 are meant
to be read jointly from left to right, rather than sequentially. For instance,
the gloss to the example given below should be read as;
wuddumbuny-ngerr -mi -wul
-nime-pagu
3pl Shove
-dl/1sg-Val-return- tr | -HITHSeSU Perf
Su/DO
su
They (three) brought me back here.
""third plural subject, ‘shove’ auxiliary in perfective inflection, portmanteau
dual subject and first singular direct object, valence increaser, return (verb
root), trial subject, hither directional”
As evident in the above example, I use a slash / between the glossed
elements of a portmanteau morpheme.
Another minor convention is the
inclusion, below the verb root, of the meaning of the verb. This is given
only in those verbs whose meaning is unpredictable from the combination
of the auxiliary and verb root semantics.
Auxiliary roots are glossed by name (e.g. 'Shove' in the example
above). The semantic nature of auxiliary verbs is discussed in detail in
chapter 5, and readers seeking explanation of auxiliary root glosses are
referred to this section. The 31 auxiliary names are listed below.

seeDtrThe fourth line of examples, in plain script, provides an English
translation. I've been fairly free with translations, attempting, in addition to
an accurate rendition, to convey something of the speech style. To this end,
in a few cases I have translated using expressions that are characteristic of
the English of Ngan'gityemerri speakers, but which may be less well known
in standard Australian English.
The use of brackets ( ) in the fourth line of examples either provides
contextual information which is missing from the given example, but
established within the wider discourse, or clarifies implications of the
example. e.g. I brought it for her (to give to her), (on her behalf), (at her
request) etc. A bracketed sentence below the line-4 translation is an
alternative translation.
Example numbers are of the form 3-56, where 3 denotes the chapter
number, and 56 denotes the example number within that chapter. Examples
in each chapter are renumbered from 1. Ngan'gikurunggurr examples are
marked by 'NgK’ below the example number. All examples not designated
as NgK should be understood to be Ngan'giwumirri, unless specified in the
text as some other language.","[22, 23, 24]"

"As noted for the postural classification of main auxiliaries, although
the serialised ‘sit' auxiliary can function literally to denote a sitting postural
orientation, especially when contrasted with ‘lie/stand’, in general it is the
unmarked choice for imperfective actions performed within a single
location. Thus examples 3-241 and 3-242 above can be said to be highly
marked with respect to posture. The non-literal posturally unmarked usage
of 'sit' results in its serialisation on verbs that are not necessarily performedin a sitting posture.",[208]
"the ‘vowel space’, in the sense of Ladefoged(1975:67), remains unexploited.
For instance although unstressed vowels tend to be slightly centralised,
there are no truly central allophones, all normal phonetic realisation being
in the periphery of vowel space. The main opposition found is between sets
of tense and lax allophones, conditioned by word position.
The tense, more extreme allophone occurs word

"For the apical series, medial /t/ is long and has clear lag VOT, and

glottal activity. Glottal timing is not a reliable cue in the contrast between
initial dorsals, which can only be distinguished in terms of stricture type.
The mechanisms by which a contrast could be maintained are set outfor each place of articulation in Table 2-3 below.

2.2.4Phonological Solution
The contrast in Ngan'gityemerri is based on glottal timing, and can be
characterised phonetically as a contrast between voiced and voiceless stops.
The uncharacteristically short duration of medial /d/ (that would
make possible a contrast between medial apical stops in terms of
constriction duration) results from the frequent realisation of /d/ as either a
tap or approximant. Within the parameters of a voiced/voiceless analysis,
these instances of shortened or incomplete articulatory closure are quite
explicable as an active mechanism intended to facilitate the continuation of
glottal pulsing.

Looking back at the two vowel-initial syllable types, we find that
allowing for them within this formula is slighty problematic. Although
the occurence of vowel-initial words in Ngan'gityemerri is quite high
(several hundred easily), these are almost entirely attributible to a single
morpheme - the animal classmarker /a-/, eg: a-matyi ‘kangaroo’. Vowelinitial words other than those derived by prefixation of this classmarker are
sufficiently scarce that they can be listed here in their entirety.

Initial /k/ is uniformally voiceless and has an even longer VOT than
either /p/ or /t/13. Initial /g/ is always realised as a fricative and varies
freely in the activity of the glottis.
Most tokens of initial /g/ aremodal values for the stop categories in these languages, -100ms, +10ms and +75ms. They found
that in no language which had a contrast between two sets of stops, were the locations of the
two sets of stops at opposite ends of the voice onset time scale. That is, the contrast was
always lead(-100) vs smail lag(+10), or small lag(+10) vs big lag(+75), never lead(-100) vs
big lag(+75). Lisker and Abramson additionally found that three-stop-category languages,
like Armenian and Thai, also had these categories distributed over ranges centering on -100,
+10 and +75 ms. Noting that the variation in boundaries between categories along the VOT
continuum is far from random, they speak of ""three general phonetic types from which thecategories of a particular language are selected"", and suggest that VOT may be a ""predictable
consequence of differences in the relative timing of events at the glottis and at the place of
oral occlusion""(1967:402). The VOT mechanism in Ngan'giwumirri clearly differs from thelanguages they studied in having clear lead(-40) vs lag(+35) modal values for initial
bilabial and apical stops. Note though that the Ngan'giwumirri lead and lag values are
mid-range, i.e. the lead value (-40) is a little less than half that reported by Lisker and
Abramson (-100), and the NgW. lag values.lag value (+35) lies between their small (+10) and big (+75)In this respect the NgWdata accords with their observation that ""in thePhonetic realisation of phonemic contrasts human beings fall considerably short of utilisingall the phonetic space available to them (1964:407).

"A far greater range of clusters isproducedby these morphological processes than those selective fewexploited intra-morphemically.
Now, with one extension and one minor exception, any C3 can be
followed by any Cy, ie: any word final consonant can be followed by one
which can occur initially. The extension is that the continuant /r/ which
has an extremely rare final occurrence, can now be followed by any Ci
consonant. The one exception is that no voiced stop or fricative can follow
a voiceless stop.
This is merely a theoretical constraint though,
as
Ngan'gityemerri morphemes are so structured that such impermissible
clusters are not produced (ie: no morpheme ends in a voiced stop, no suffix
begins with a voiced stop, no prefixes end in a voiceless stop).
Triconsonant Clusters:C2 C3 +CqTriconsonant-clusters do not occur intra-morphemically. They are
produced only across morpheme boundaries, as the result of two
morphological processes: reduplication and affixation.
Triconsonantclusters resulting from each of these processes are examined separately here,
as there are differences in the numberof clusters they generate, and thetypes permitted in surface forms.
In Ngan'gityemerri there are a small group of monosyllables having
final CyC3 clusters (see 2.3.1), e.g purrk ‘clap’. The reduplication of such
syllables generates triconsonant-clusters of the formC;VO€2C3C;VC2C3.","[103, 104]"
"the dual direct object forms (given by Laves and Hoddinott & Kofod)spontaneously uttered.
In conclusion I would suggest that there has been a general process of
neutralisation of the non-singular bound Direct and Indirect Object
pronominal paradigms.
As the data of Laves and Hoddinott & Kofod
suggest that there was in recent times a contrast between DO and IO in both
the singular and dual number categories, we could hypothesize that at an
even earlier stage the contrast may have also been found in the plural
forms. The hypothetical neutralisation of the plural pronouns would havepredated Laves' 1930 work, and the neutralisation of the dual forms would
appear to have taken place over the last few decades. Note that this
neutralisation has involved the loss of the Direct Object forms, and that it is
the Indirect Object forms that have been retained.","[154, 155]"
"(Sapir 1911:257)3.5.3Semantics of Incorporated Bodyparts
Incorporated bodyparts take on a semantic range that extends beyond
their freeform usage. Thus we find that nguru - 'penis' comes to denote the
genitals of both sexes, muy - ‘eye’ is extended to include the face, and ge ‘belly’ covers the 'middle' of a body, not just the front, lower torso.
Additionally , there is a preference for incorporating higher-level general
terms over lower-level specific ones. Thus verbs involving activity at the
‘elbow' or 'calf muscle’, for instance, are more likely to incorporate ‘arm' or
‘leg’, respectively, than the more specific bodypart. So the division of the
body into parts, for the purpose of incorporation, is a broader, grosserdivision than it is for free forms.",[225]
"Chapter 5
Noun ClassificationNgan'gityemerri speakers employ a system of nominal classification
that divides the nominal world into fifteen categories.
Section 5.1
examines the manner in which membership within these categories is
signalled, and section 5.2 deals with the semantics of these categories. 5.3
looks at the types of modifying element that can be classmarked. 5.4 details
the suffixation of class generics to minbe ‘negative’ and tyen ‘what'. Finally
section 5.5 examines the phonological status of the set of bound class
generics, which varies between proclitics and prefixes.

Table 5-15.1
5.1.1Morphology of Nominal Classification
Descriptive Preliminaries
The classification of nouns in Ngan'gityemerri into fifteen separatecategories is signalled through the use of both freeform and bound generics.
While most nouns can be assigned to at least one class, there are some
nouns, mostly terms for natural objects such as sun, rocks, ground, stars,
tdclouds etc. that belong to no overtly marked class. I have chosen to analyse
these as belonging to no class rather than to a sixteenth O-marked class; a
decision that carries no significant consequences.
On the whole,
this system of noun classification is neither
homogenous nor internally consistent. Of the fifteen classes, six are denoted
by only freeform generics, five by only bound generics, and four employboth bound and freeform generics. Furthermore, among the class categories
having bound generics, there is considerable diversity regarding the
phonological status of those generics (see 5.5), and the types of modifiers to
which they may be attached (see 5.3).
Another important feature of the Ngan'gityemerri noun classificatory
system that will be treated here, concerns the grammatical status of the
mechanisms that signal class categories. As this has implications for the
terminology used in this section, I will begin with a review of Dixon's (1982)
comparison of the noun classification phenomena in Yidiny and Dyirbal.
Dixon (1982: chpt 5-8) compares the different systems in Yidiny and
Dyirbal that have the semantic function of classifying nouns, and contrasts
the grammatical status of these two systems. He provides criteria for
determining whether a language has a system of noun classes (like Dyirbal)on the one hand, or noun classifiers (like Yidiny) on the other.
""In summary, noun classes constitute a closed grammatical system, with a _
finite (usually fairly small) and determinable number of choices involved;each noun belongs to one class and few (or none) will correspond to more than
one class. Noun class is shown by morphological processes which can apply to
the noun itself and must apply to some other constituent; they sometimes
combine information about noun class and number, case or definiteness. The
morphological process most often involves adding an affix or clitic to
constituents of a number of specified grammatical types. Classifiers comprise a
largish (often semi-open) set, whose members may not be exhaustively
listable; each classifier is either a free form or else a root, to which a numeralaffix or clitic may be added. Not every noun may take a classifier; many nouns
may occur with one of a number of different classifiers, sometimes with a
be used in different ways in different speech styles within a language.""ayDixon goes on to speculate about the origins of these different
mechanisms in Yidiny and Dyirbal, suggesting both may have developedreBape(Dixon 1982:217-8)coatdifference in meaning and sometimes not. Classifiers, but not noun classes, mayfrom a small set of about half a dozen classifiers.","[312, 313, 314]"
"Secondly, the compounding of nominal roots, and the attachment of
enclitics to nominal roots, can potentially result in the ordering of
contiguous vowels. Such occurrences are rare within noun phrases and
impossible within the verbal complex because Ngan’gityemerri morphologyis generally constructed of CV(C) syllables. Wherever two nominal rootsforming a single phonological word, be it through compounding (as in 2-79aa) or encliticisation (as in 2-79 b), end and begin with i and a respectively,
then i is deleted. Consider the examples below.
2-79 a)
kuri - apukek

this - firstbefore now
Given the limited distribution of morpheme-initial vowels in
Negan'gityemerri, note that ita is the only possible ordering of contiguous
vowels within a single phonological word.
2.4.3.2rV Deletion
An examination of the Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr
auxiliary verb paradigms (see appendices A and B), shows evidence of a
general aversion to the occurrence in contiguous syllables of the apical stop
/d/ and continuant /r/. Where these are ordered in consecutive syllables,
the syllable containing the continuant will be deleted. e.g. -dVrV- — -dV-.
By way of example, the underlying and surface forms of the Ist, 2nd and 3rd
singular and Ist dl inc, present tense forms of the ‘sit’ auxiliary are given
below.
ngirim
yirim
dimI'm sitting.
You're sitting.
He's sitting.ngindimWe (dlinc) are sitting.","[109, 110]"
"It is also apparent from Table 3-3 that there is currently complete
neutralisation of the Direct Object and Indirect Object non-singular
pronouns. Evidence from the Ngan'gimerri data collected by Gerhardt
Laves in about 1930 suggests that the current paradigm results from the
collapse of an earlier system where the contrast between Direct and Indirect
Object bound pronouns was additionally made in the ist exclusive, 2nd and
3rd person dual forms. From Laves' work we can reconstruct the following
forms for Ngan'‘gimerri, a now extinct dialect of Ngan'gityemerri.

Table 3-4Hoddinott also collected some Ngan'giwumirri data, presumably in
the early 1970's’, and the bound object pronouns provided in Hoddinott
and Kofod (1989:103), concur with Laves' Ngan'gimerri data in showing the
same distinction between dual Direct and Indirect Object pronouns. The
complete absence of distinct dual DO and IO pronouns in the speech of the
Ngan'giwumirri people that I worked with between 1986 and 1988, suggests
that this distinction has only been lost in very recent years. I never heard7According to Kofod he collected Ngan'gikurunggurr material during four fieldtrips, in 1967,
1972, 1973 and 1982. His Ngan'giwumirri data was presumably also collected on one or more of
these trips.",[154]
"His bracketed inclusion of a voiced stop series in thephonemic inventory gives /g/ as a stop.
Hoddinott & Kofod (1988:10-14) recognise the existence of a contrast in
Ngan'gikurunggurr, but provide an even more confusing analysis.
Beginning with the claim that ""Stops are normally long in
medial...position"", they go on to describe a contrast in terms of ‘voicing’.
Medially they find voiceless /k/ phonetically [k], contrasting with /g/,
phonetically[g] ~ [x] ~ [y].",[78]
"In this position it occurs within a wide range of phonetic
environments - stressed and unstressed, postnasally, framed byall four vowels, etc. It seems then that this dental as opposed to5As these word initial voiced laminals are restricted to a finite set of well known terms, it

terms of either environmental or articulatory conditioning®.
Finally, we note a dialectal difference in the treatment of word
and morpheme final /ty/. In Ngan'gikurunggurr word- and
morpheme-final /ty/ is released, but in Ngan'giwumirri it
remains unreleased.

and intervocalically this phone varies freely between voiceless

TextsTrip to Melbourne
Strychnine
Escape from Fanny Bay Gaol
Pelican's EggText 1
Trip to Melbourne
Speaker - Robert Daly
Recorded at Peppimenarti in September 1988
(AIAS Reid NgW Tapes 8 & 9 1988)This text was given by my main Ngan'giwumirri teacher Robert Daly, shortlyafter his return from a trip to Melbourne where, as an accomplished ‘bambooman', he and a Marrisyebin singer named Martin Warrigal were invited to
perform at an ethnomusicological conference.
What is given here is of
necessity an extract, for the full text runs for over two hours and 100 pages of
transcription. This text contains many features that are typical of Robert's
narrative style; extreme detail given to travel, including all stops, and people
met with along the way (getting from Peppimenarti to Melbourne takes 38
pages); great care taken to recount events in their correct chronological order;
and determination to describe non-traditional things (such as trams and
escalators) in his own language where possible, without lapsing into English. At
the same time this text is full of new impressions; the Melbourne zoo, trams,
escalators, restaurants, performing before large crowds of strangers, and
uncertainty of the rules of such aspects of college life as smorgasborg meals and
communal bathrooms. We take the story up from their arrival at their lodgings.

Note that the sense of ‘destination of a motion verb’ that nganconveys in this relative clause structure is compatible with the ‘endpointlocation’ sense of the nominal enclitic -nide (see 6.1.6). Indeed both nganand -nide can co-attach to an NP, as in 5-1245-124 yagadi -tye ngan-dede ngayi-nide

However ngan- cannot be compatible with the ‘static location’ senseattributed to -nide in 6.1.613.
13In this respect ngan- differs from an otherwise similar morpheme in Marrithiyel. The
Marrithiyel form ni corresponds very closely to Ngan'gityemerri ngan- in both its combination
with major bodypart terms to form a CVS, and in its relative clause function (Green 1989:3007). However Marrithiyel ni appears to have a more general relative function, in that it is not
restricted to a locative/destination interpretation, and can be compatible with static location
verbs, as in the example below taken from Green (1989:301). (While I have supplied Green's
translation, for comparative purposes I have taken the liberty of providing the interlinear
gloss in terms of the conventions used for Ngan'gityemerri).","[345, 346]"
"Howeverthe two categories whichareglossed as 'Present' and 'Perfective' in Ngan'giwumirri, appear to have
been collapsed in Ngan'gikurunggurr into a single inflectional categorylabelled ‘Present’. The range of tense/aspect/mood values covered by the
Ngan'gikurunggurr ‘Present’
appears to be the sum of the range of
tense/aspect/mood values of the two distinct Ngan'giwumirri inflectional
categories ‘Present’ and 'Perfective'. This is demonstrated in a comparison
of the range of meanings given in 3-175 a) and b), and 3-183 a). The
motivation for, and consequences of, the merging of these auxiliary
inflectional categories in Ngan'gikurunggurr is addressed in the following
section.
3.4.2Historical Auxiliary Tense Suffixes
So far we have seen that Ngan'giwumirri auxiliary roots inflect for
the four tense/aspect/mood categories Present, Perfective, Past Imperfective,
and Irrealis (cf. 3.4.1), and that the auxiliary root forms, can be characterised
as having the syllabic structure 'N', 'CVN' or 'CVCVN' (cf. 3.2.2). More
accurately we can characterise the auxiliary root templates as O-, CV-, or
'CVCV-’ followed by an element (-N or -NV or @) that has fairly regular
formal correspondences across the four tense/aspect/mood categories. In
3-184 below, the Ist singular subject-auxiliary sequences of these four
categories are set out, for the 'Sit', ‘Say’, Hands’, ‘ShoveDtrD', ‘PokeDtr',
‘HandsDtr' and 'FeetDtr' auxiliaries. The final -N or -NV element of the
auxiliary root is set apart and given in bold script.

tense/mood marking. The auxiliary root in 3-75 a) achieves its Irrealis
inflection by dropping its final nasal (cf. 3.4.2), but the 2sg IO allomorphy
reinstates it, and as a consequence the present and irrealis inflected verbs
both end up with the same surface form.
The other allomorphy is to be found in the 3rd non-sg forms, where
the same environments, ie. post-vocalic and post-nasal, produce variationbetween -wurr(ki) and-burr(ki) respectively. This is demonstrated nicely in
3-82 below.","[152, 153]"
"While the general observation that dual subject number is marked by
-gV in the final position within the auxiliary accounts for the vast majority
of dual subject auxiliary inflections, for four auxiliaries (‘Sit, 'Go, ‘Poke’ and
‘Slash') dual subject number is marked suppletively in the Past Imperfective
inflection by a change in vowel quality of the auxiliary root form. The Ist
person singular, Ist dual exclusive, and Ist plural exclusive Past
Imperfective forms of these four auxiliaries are given in 3-68 below.

Present and Perfective, and -yirri for the Irrealis, and it marks dual with
-girri. These forms are unattested elsewhere within the auxiliary paradigms.",[149]
"A glance at the Ist person exclusive forms for all four inflectional categories,
set out in the example below, shows the Past Imperfective category to befurther anomalous in switching these suffixes, and having
marking the dual, and -girri the plural.","[149, 150]"
"TriconsonantClustersFigure 2-12However, as the examples below show, /p/ has not been recorded in C3 in a
triconsonant cluster, and /k/ has not been recorded in C;. Given that /p/
appears as C3 in C2Cs3 clusters in unreduplicated syllables, eg ngurrp ‘emu’,
and /k/ otherwise appears in C;, these gaps appear to be accidental rather
than in any way systematic.2-65

Not only are triconsonant-clusters resulting from reduplication heavily
resizicted by the small number of monosyllabic C;1VC2C3 words, but where
C3 and Cy, share the samemannerof articulation they are subject to amorphophonological rule that deletes C3 (see 2.4.1).
In contrast the process of affixation generates a far wider number of
triconsonant-clusters, all of which are permitted (i.e. clusters where C3 and
C4 share the same manner of articulation are not affected by the rule
discussed in 2.4.1).
Monosyllabic verb roots ending in C2C3 clusters are typically followedby consonant initial verbal enclitics.

subject marker is basically wV-, though 3rd singular subjects show a varietyof suppletive and irregular forms. Treating all four of the attested
realisations (wV-, yV-, O-, dV-) as a single system called ‘wV- marking’,
this system contrasts with another 3rd person bound subject marker of the
form gV-, referred to as 'gV- marking’.
The functional nature of the contrast between ‘wV- marking’ and'gV- marking’ has been problematic for me, and appears. to have been so for
previous investigators of the language, for each has drawn different
conclusions.",[134]
