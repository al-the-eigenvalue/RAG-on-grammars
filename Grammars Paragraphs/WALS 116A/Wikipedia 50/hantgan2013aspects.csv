He is writing books.
The number of the subject does not change the word order, and the allomorphy on the
incompletive particle is discussed in Chapter 9. Both sentences are in the default word order
found for the incompletive aspects, S-AUX-O-V. In some cases, such as in texts, with examples
found in Appendix I, Text II: Chief 3.4 - 5, it appears that the cause of the word order change is
one of topic. Topicalization can also be differentiated by asking a question.
11.6.1 Topicalization on Verb
The first question, in (367), was meant to focus on the task the subject is performing, reading or
writing. Four distinct answers are possible, given in the order listed below. The structure of
questions is presented in 10.1.

The default answer, although not the default word order for an incompletive sentence, is
with the object first, although the question posed referred to the action and not the undergoer of
that action.

In each of these questions, the question marker is clause-initial, the verb is last, with the
exception of [nii] ‘how’ in (341) (notice the alternation between the two forms for ‘how’ if one
compares the phrase in (340)).
The following examples in (343) - (336) illustrate a VC2 verb, /ji/ ‘do’, in questions.
Note that the VC2 stem includes the [–r] suffix in each of these examples.

"83precedes a noun which begins with an initial nasal-nasal sequence, the initial nasal deletes.
Otherwise, the syllabicity of the noun stem is unaffected. Since none of these morphemes affect
the syllabicity of the noun stem, none is considered a bound affix. These markers, save for the
genitive nasal, have tones which interact with the noun in the manner shown in Chapter 5.
Associated with verbs are inflectional suffixes, described in Chapter 8, and derivational
suffixes, analyzed in Chapter 9. Verb particles expressing tense, aspect, and mood distinctions,
discussed in Chapter 9, are affected by the subject pronouns tonally and segmentally, but do not
affect the verbs they precede.
As noted, a nasal precedes many nouns and verbs. The first and third person pronouns
may be represented as a nasal preceding objects, verbs or verb particles. The pronoun nasal does
not bear tone independent of the word it precedes. The pronoun nasal does not contribute to the
syllabicity of a noun or a verb; however, it does appear to affect the verb particle in the manner
outlined in Chapter 8. The pronoun nasal is considered to be more closely bound to the verb
particle than it is to content words, nouns and verbs. The transitive marker, also a nasal, is
shown to affect the syllabicity of the verb stem in Chapter 14.

cliticGeneralizations about the SyllableThere is a minimal word constraint in Bangime: a word must have at least two morae.
Disyllabic footing is binary, with most words consisting of a light-light, heavy-light or lightheavy combination. Trisyllabic syllables are limited to one mora per syllable.
The phonotactics of the language determine the available syllable types in Bangime, and
many phonological processes occur at syllable boundaries rather than at morpheme boundaries,
as the language has little affixal morphology.
2.7Summary of FeaturesThe vowel inventory of Bangime consists of seven vowels with length and nasalization being
largely, but not entirely, predictable. Front vowels often combine to make diphthongs. Tense or
[+ATR] mid vowels become lax or [–ATR] before sonorants. Due to the lack of affixal
processes, most phonological effects are seen word-medially at syllable boundaries. Wordinitially, syllable onsets are limited to the less sonorous consonants. Word-internally, or
intervocalically, consonants may be lenited to become more sonorous. Onsetless syllables are
very rare and syllable codas limited to syllable position. Consonants may be pre-nasalized,
nasalized, or labialized. Tone is determined grammatically or by frozen suffixes.","[102, 103, 104]"
"265The sentence in (369) is like that in (368), with a different noun. Both of these answers
refer to one who is writing a letter or a book.
sàɡòmɛ́ n ná n ɲɔ̀ɡɔ̀ndó
letter ~2 INC T write
I am writing a letter.
Notice again that the object appears first, not the action, which would be expected if the
response was one of topicalization to the question.
The sentence which appears in (370) is in the default word order for an incompletive
sentence; as in (365) - (366) above, the object precedes the verb.
n náà sàɡòmɛ́ n ɲɔ̀ɡɔ̀ndó
1.S INC letter T write

The default word order is when the particle follows the subject marker which in turn
precedes both the object and the verb in an incompletive clause.
Unexpectedly, the incompletive aspect, marked by the /daw/ particle and the final nonhigh suffix in (371), is expressed using the SVO word order, which is normally used with the
perfective aspect.

may also be reversed without an apparent change in meaning, as shown in the following
subsection.","[284, 285]"
"26611.6.2 Topicalization on Object
When a question is intended to differentiate objects instead of actions, as in (372), the response
in (372) is again the preferred answer, although not the default word order for an incompletive
sentence, that of the subject phrase-initially, followed by the aspect marker, which is in turn
followed by the verb.

11.6.3 Topicalization Changes in other Tenses
Examples of the verb ‘step on’ (374), a verb not marked inflectionally for tense or aspect,
illustrate the word-order variation for additional tenses. The default word order for an
incompletive clause with an object is SOV, as shown in (374) as SOV.

1.S INC T step on
I am stepping on.
n dáá kéndɛ̀ kéɛ̀ m póɣɔ̀
1.S INC slither thing T step on
I am stepping on a snake.
The object ‘a slithering thing’, meaning ‘snake’ precedes the verb as expected in an
incompletive clause.
The present tense is also shown to display variable word order in (376). The word order
of the sentence above may not be changed if the aspect is incompletive [*n dáá póɣɔ̀ kɛ́ndɛ̀ kɛ́è].","[285, 286]"
"25210.5 Mood
The irrealis, imperative, subjunctive, and prohibitional moods are found in Bangime and are each
marked by particles shown in this section.
10.5.1 Irrealis
The irrealis is marked by the particle [ha] and is used with a verb stem in clauses such as ‘I wish
to do X’ or ‘in order to’ as in (328) - (329). Conditional phrases may also use the irrealis marker
in the second clause (330). The hortative (331) may also be marked with the particle [ha].

The irrealis and the word ‘until’ are not thought to be related.
10.6 Copula
A particle which has arisen in texts but is difficult to elicit seems to act as a copula in some verb
clauses, such as those listed in (334). The copula /maa/ can be used in a manner similar to ‘be’
in English. In the cases elicited, the copula serves as the perfective aspect. However, it has
occurred in texts in other tenses as well. The copula [maa] is used with humans.

verb. The verb phrases in (335c - d) were translated in the incompletive aspect and future tenses
even though it is not clear from the word order or inflectional marking that there is a difference.
10.7 Question Particles
The structure of a question is Q–S–V. The question particles are phrase-initial, listed in the
following question phrases using the same verb ‘cultivate’ in (336) - (341).

kamAnother property of VC5 stems is their tendency to reduplicate. Shown in (246), the
perfective aspect of a VC5 stem is a reduplicated form (246c) of the verb stem. The reduplicated
form of the verb (246c) appears with the [–r] suffix, or with an intervening nasal, but not both,
bearing on the question of timing discussed in Chapter 14. The correspondence between the
nasal and the [–r] suffix is also seen in negative phrases. Examples (246d - e) and the sentences
in (246) show that there is also a correlation between the incompletive marker /daw/ allomorphy
and the nasal, which may appear between reduplicated stems.

"46Most words, particularly nouns, begin with a high tone, and most suffixes (some of which are
frozen or suffixal remnants) have a low tone; thus, most words have a falling tonal melody.
Verbs do not surface without grammatical tone which interacts with the underlying tone of the
verb root.
2.2VowelsAlthough minimal pairs are found based on vowel length, quality, tone, and nasalization, each of
these values is largely predictable. That is, while each of these features can be contrastive, the
contrasts may, and often are, neutralized in the contexts explained in this chapter. In some cases,
only a single word may have the vowel quality listed. The number of words found in the lexicon
for each feature is shown in the columns above the examples presented.
Phonetically, Bangime has a seven vowel system presented in (30).
Phonemic Vowel Inventory
/i e ɛ a ɔ o u/
Vowel length and nasalization are predictable based on the length of the word. Values
for [ATR] are also predictable. Combinations of vowels may occur without an intervening
segment. Vowels which occur in the same syllable are considered diphthongs. The inventory of
diphthongs is shown in (31).
Diphthongs
[ie iɛ ɛe eɛ aɛ ɔo oɔ]
Diphthongs are pronounced as one vowel, or, in careful speech, may be pronounced
separately, which raises the question as to whether or not there is a syllable break. The high
front vowel may combine with a mid front [±ATR] vowel or the low vowel to form diphthongs
but the high back vowel may not combine with any other vowel tautosyllabically.","[65, 66]"
"Verb Particles10.1 Overview of TAM Particles
In addition to inflectional suffixation based on verb category (shown in the previous two
chapters), the TAM category of a clause is further specified by verb particles. As shown in the
previous chapters, each tense and aspect particle is paired with inflectional marking on the verb
stem, and each verb class has its own set of inflectional patterns. Most verb particles directly
precede the verb except the perfect clitic and the stative suffix. The future marker is an
allomorph of the incompletive, but follows rather than precedes the verb. The verb particles are
listed in (289).

are incompletive (INC), completive (CPL), perfect (PRF) and stative (STAT). The verb moods
are the irrealis (IRR), prohibitive (PROH), and imperative (IMP). Examples of each verb
particle are given in this chapter. The perfective is unmarked by any particles. Because the
incompletive aspects and aspects are all marked with the verb particle /daw/, they are presented
together in §10.3. In §10.4 the completive aspect and completive aspect markers are discussed.
The modal categories are shown in §10.5. The copula is shown in §10.6. In the interest of
descriptive completeness, question particles are presented in §10.7. Most of the examples used
in this chapter involve the verb ‘cultivate’. Supplemental examples are from narratives.",[258]
"/LH/Cv̀Cv́Cv̀Cv́=ndɛ̀Most nouns in the first and second tonal classes are monosyllabic. Most roots with level
tone melodies, those which are able to surface without a pitch change somewhere in the stem, are
monosyllabic, but not all monosyllabic stems have level tone melodies. 40 All stems which
surface with level tones in the singular also surface with level tones in the plural. Nouns of the
third and fourth types have the same tones underlyingly as nouns in the first and second types but
the stems are mostly polysyllabic. The underlying tones of nouns in the fifth and sixth typesSome verbs exhibit a semantic relationship between a stem with and without a [–r] suffix. The same has not been
found among most nouns. However a possible example could be argued for [níɛ́rɛ́ (hùⁿ)] ‘dry season’ and [níé (hùⁿ)]
‘wet season’.

The modifier ‘be uneven’ (216a) is a verb, while the modifier ‘soft’ (216b) is an
adjective. The incompletive particle in the first phrase is used with the verb ‘be uneven’, but the
incompletive particle (216b) is used with the verb ‘say’. A verb is distinguished from an
adjective because the former does not necessitate the nominalizer [kii] and may follow the
particle [daw]. For example the adjective ‘soft’, [kíì dérɛ́b–íɛ̀] ‘it is soft’ but *[daw derɛbɛ].

The negative marker [bie] serves to negate both a
noun and a verb phrase. The negative particle may precede or follow a noun in a noun phrase,
but it only precedes a verb. In a negated verb phrase, there are two aspects, incompletive and
completive. Transitive verbs in Class Two and Three take the [–r] suffix, or the [–d] allomorph,
in the negative completive aspect. Class Two verbs take the [–r] suffix in the positive
completive aspect as well. Class Three verbs take a nasalized allomorph of the suffix [–r]̃ in the
positive completive aspect and [–d] in the positive incompletive aspect. In the positive forms,
the root without the [–r] suffix only appears in the perfect and perfective. Again, the meaning of
[–r] is ambiguous as to how it relates to the TAM, and polar, category. In a negative completive
sentence, the transitive nasal is deleted before Class Two and Three verbs. There appears to be a
correlation between the number of morae in a negated completive verb and a negated
incompletive verb so that the [–r] suffix and the root vowel correlates with the transitive nasal in
terms of number of morae in the respective stems. With negated intransitive verbs, the
difference in the aspect is tone and/or the [–r] suffix, but no corresponding nasal. The details of
the issue of the morae and timing in the sentence is left to future research.","[346, 347, 348]"

The tones of the noun are not affected when the negative marker follows the noun. The
fact that the negative marker may surface either before or after the noun makes it difficult to
assign to a specific morphological category such as pre or post clitic, prefix or suffix.
14.3 Negative Adjectival Predicate
Adjectives may not stand alone; they require a dummy noun such as ‘thing’ in a positive phrase.
However, a negative adjectival predicate may consist only of the adjective preceded by the
negative marker. As shown above, the negative marker may act as a copula and a negative with
negative existential predicate noun phrases. In (476), we see that the negative marker acts in a
similar manner with adjectives.

the singular (476a), plural (476b), or with two conjoined adjectives (476c). The negative marker
precedes each constituent in the phrase; it cannot negate the entire sentence at the beginning.
14.4 Negative in a Possessive Noun Phrase
In negative possessive noun phrases, the negative precedes the possessive pronoun. The set of
pronouns that was briefly mentioned in §5.2 is used with the negative marker. If a noun is used,
the negative marker precedes the noun, which is followed by the possessive pronoun.
The negative marker precedes the noun in demonstrative phrases, shown in (477).

and the possessive marker (477c). The demonstrative (477d) follows the same pattern as (477c).
14.5 Tonal effects of the Negative on Noun Stems
As with other morphemes which precede a noun, the possessive proclitics and the definite
marker, the negative morpheme changes the tone of the noun.

Compounds are not a productive means of creating new lexical items in Bangime. Two potential
exceptions are shown in (480) to illustrate that the tones are not affected by the negative marker.
The word ‘child’ has a bound or lexicalized diminutive suffix in the singular citation form
[jaambɛ] but emerges as [jaa=ndɛ] in the plural and with [pʷiɛ]. The word [pʷiɛ] refers to a
‘wife’, but when following the root of ‘child’ the stem means ‘girl’. Similarly, when the word
[boro+mbɛ], plural [boro=ndɛ] ‘boy/boys’, follows the root of ‘child’, it means ‘young men’.

noun, with the exception of the dummy noun (481c - d), each noun has a high tone on the final
mora. It appears that the adjective blocks the tone lowering of the negative marker but that the
adjective itself is unaffected.
14.5.3 Summary of the Negative effects on the NP
The negative marker may precede or follow a noun in a NP. When it precedes a noun, it changes
the tone(s) of the noun. If an adjective follows a noun, the tone of the noun is affected. The next
section shows the tonal and segmental effects of the negative marker with a verb.
14.6 Negative Verb Phrase
The TAM categories are simplified in a negated clause. There are only two aspects when the
clause is marked as negative: incompletive and completive. The negative marker [bie] precedes
the verb just as it does a noun. The difference in the incompletive and completive aspects
depends on the verb’s inflectional class and the valency of the verb. Evidence from narratives
shows that the tones in negated clauses follow the opposite pattern as those described for positive
ones. Text XII, Tiga 2.14, 20, 26, shows that the tonal patterns shown for positive clauses is
reversed; the first person is associated with low tone on the verb and high tone on the object.
14.6.1 VC2 Stems
The present tense in both negative and positive clauses has SOV word order. The verb stem is
unsuffixed for inflection, and the verb stem is preceded by the transitive nasal.
In the completive aspect, just as with a positive clause, the word order is SVO. The verb
root is followed by the [–r] suffix. As discussed in Chapter 8, verbs in Class Two take the [–r]
suffix only in the completive aspect. Examples from texts, Chief 1.3, 4 show that when a clause
is in the present tense and the verb takes a direct object, the object directly precedes the verb.","[338, 339, 340]"
"321The word order of a negated present tense clause is S-AUX-O-V, just as with the positive
incompletive marker /daw/.
In both tenses, the tone of the verb stem after the negative marker is in most cases low,
although there are exceptions. First person singular examples are shown in (482).

appears when the verb is a negated completive stem. The transitive nasal and the [–r] suffix are322in complementary distribution in negated verb stems, just as was shown for verbs that
reduplicate and take the [–r] suffix.
14.6.2 Timing in the Negative VC2 Stem
The negative verb phrase differs from the positive verb phrase in the behavior of the transitive
nasal. The completive lacks the nasal, and it employs the [–r] suffix on the verb; the present
surfaces with the nasal, but the verb does not have the suffix. The difference between the present
and completive aspects in the negative is one of timing. Each verb phrase contains the exact
same number of syllables and morae, as illustrated in (484).

1.8.4Greeting SequencesA curiosity in Bangime are the greeting sequences shown in (28), or rather, lack thereof. Most,
if not all, African languages are known for their lengthy call and response greeting sequences.
Bangime has the normal question-type of greetings, but there are few responses which are not
borrowings from Arabic, and many are simply intonational prolongations of the greeting itself.

are curious. Note that, in addition to the relative simplicity of these greetings, there is no
introductory [pòó] or final [tàárè] common to every Dogon language. The one similarity
between the Bangime greeting sequence and those of Dogon languages is the afternoon
introductory greeting [tija], which is also used in the neighboring Dogon language Tiranige.
Thus, the key grammatical aspects of Bangime which separate it from other languages in
the area in which it is spoken in Central-Eastern Mali are (1) disharmonic sequences for the
feature [ATR] tautosyllabically and tautomorphemically, (2) lack of bound morphology, (3)
person agreement marking on objects in the verb phrase, and (4) word order specified by tense.
Among the core vocabulary items, some lexical items bear strong resemblances with Dogon
languages, and consistent sound changes are found between Bangime and potentially related
Dogon words. The Dogon languages themselves vary extensively and lexical correspondences
between Bangime and the Dogon languages are found in a geographically widely distributed
area. Although Bangime is not a Dogon language, I hypothesize that the language had a
connection to, or borrowed from, the Dogon languages at a time when the Dogon languages were
more cohesive. Suggestions as to why the Bangime speakers drew so heavily upon the
vocabulary of Dogon and not the grammar are outlined in the following subsections.
1.9Bangime: ‘a secret language’During the last few months of my second to last fieldwork trip, it became clear that elicited
lexical items were not the same as those used in natural conversation. The elicited items were
often loanwords. These contrast with the periphrastic expressions used in speech. For example,
the word given for ‘fence’ [sáàⁿ], suggests a loan word from Bamana [saaⁿ], but in every day
usage, the phrase [bùrá̃ míndé ɥùrúɡí dóò à ɡòmè màá kɛ́rɛ́], translated as, ‘stick(s) put into the38ground so that people may pass next to the rice’, is employed to describe, in this instance, a fence
surrounding the rice fields. In fact, ‘sáàⁿ’ is unacceptable for any type of fencing if one is
speaking the “true” language. Further examples of so-called “deep Bangime” are shown in (29).

The future tense can be formed in two ways: O-S-V-AUX or O-AUX-S-V. The incompletive
particle /daw/ may follow the verb, shown in (360). The object precedes both the subject and the
verb. The other common way of expressing the future when the subject is not a pronoun is to use
a construction which is similar to the passive, shown in (361). The object is phrase-initial with
the verb at the end of the phrase. 51

[ɔo](17 words)a.bɔ́ófatherb.nŋɔ́ótravel[oɔ](50 words)aa.bóɔ̀borderbb.nŋòɔ́meatIn summary, among monosyllabic stems, three contrasts are found regularly in the
distribution of diphthongs. Mid [+ATR] and [–ATR] front vowels co-occur tautosyllabically and
contrast with mid and high front vowels, as shown in examples (32) - (33). The high front
vowel may co-occur with a mid front [±ATR] vowel. The low vowel [a] may combine with the
mid [–ATR] vowel as was shown in (34). Mid back vowels may co-occur tautosyllabically but
the high back vowel (35) does not. Among bisyllabic stems, diphthongs occur typically in the
final syllable (33) of nouns, but may also appear in the initial syllable of adjectives. Many nouns
surface with final front vowel diphthongs, a consequence of a frozen diminutive suffix.
Because the distribution of long vowels of the same quality is limited, diphthongs form in
cases where long vowels are not permitted, and therefore consist of two morae. While words
may contrast on the basis of the vowel quality of the diphthong, in three cases, diphthong
formation is predictable. As discussed in detail below, there is a minimal word constraint of two
morae. Therefore, one instance in which diphthongs surface where long vowels would occur is
in monosyllabic stems, due to a dispreference for long vowels, discussed in detail below.
The second case of predictable diphthongs is when the [ATR] quality of a vowel
contributes to its ability to surface as either long or short. The high vowels [i u] do not have
surface [–ATR] counterparts *[ɪ ʊ], and thus it is possible to for long high vowels to surface.
However, this does not account for the lack of mid and high back vowels combining to form
diphthongs.","[68, 69]"
"201A list of all the VC1 verb roots is shown in (236). The majority of verb roots in VC1

pir202As shown in the first column of stems (236a - e, o), the mid vowels in verb roots in VC1
undergo height harmony with the suffix vowel in the default stem. It was shown in §2.2.3 that
some mid vowels become [–ATR] before the velar plosive, however each of these words shows
that the [ATR] value of the suffix is always [–ATR] after [ɡ]. Verb roots which contain low
(236f - j, p) and high (236k - n, t) vowels are suffixed with a default [a] in the default stem.
Here, we see a similarity to some Dogon languages in that only mid vowels have a [±ATR]
surface alternation. I suggest that the mid vowels in verb stems undergo [ATR] harmony at
some level in the derivational process and that [a] is a default vowel which is suffixed to the high
and low vowels because they do not have [±ATR] counterparts. As has been shown, many stems
are disharmonic for the feature [ATR].
Recall that a final low vowel is long after [–r] (236p, t). The final [a] is prevented from
lengthening if the initial syllable is already heavy (236r) as two heavy syllables are uncommon in
a bisyllabic word.
The perfect stems take the high back vowel [u] as the suffix. All the verbs found in the
VC1 are transitive, except ‘drip’. The final vowel of the verb stem is the non-high allomorph in
all forms except the perfect. The uninflected or chaining form which follows an inflected verb,
such as shown in textual examples, Text VI: Chief VI.11, is also the non-high vowel. For this
reason, I consider the vowel to be a default vowel which does not contribute to the inflectional
marking on the stem.
An alternative analysis for the verb roots in VC1 is to suggest that the final [ɡ], [ŋ], or [r]
consonant is a suffix, since all the other verb classes are composed of a root plus a suffix [–r].
However, an instance of a Class One verb which is suffixed with [–r] is found in TEXT VI:
Chief 6.30. The sentence is unusual in that the indirect object is in subject position.","[220, 221, 222]"
"32514.6.3 Intransitive Stems with the [–r] Suffix
Among verbs that are suffixed with the [–r] morpheme, few are intransitive, with examples listed
in (486). Intransitive verbs cannot compensate for the loss of the mora in the incompletive
negative stem, as there is no transitive morpheme.

number of morae in the corresponding present and completive sentences must contain equal
numbers. Since the transitive morpheme, a homorganic nasal, must precede the verb in the
present tense forms to follow the correct word order, this takes the place of one mora and thus,
the present tense verb stem deletes a syllable to compensate. Further, the data illustrate that even
if the clause contains an object, the nasal marker remains, showing that it is a true marker of
transitivity and not a pronominal form. The data show that intransitive verb sentences do not
follow the same mora-timing pattern, but the syllables are still of the same number.
14.7 Transitive Verbs
Verbs which do not take the [–r] suffix also do not compensate for the lack of the nasal in the
negative completive aspect stem. In addition to the presence or absence of the transitive nasal,326transitive verbs without the [–r] suffix show a tonal difference. Based on the above conclusion
that the language is mora-timed, the tonal assignment is likely to have a correlation based on the
mora timing as well but this needs further investigation. The verbs in (487) show a pattern of a
high tone on the final mora of the Incompletive stem and a low on the final mora of the
completive aspect stem.

"The diphthong [iɛ] is common in words which contrast solely on the basis of tone
(33a - aa), (33b - bb). The examples (33aa) and (33bb) show another near minimal pair for
monosyllabic words which begin with the consonant [bʷ] or [ɥ]. Bisyllabic words may also
contrast for diphthong quality; this is in part due to the frozen suffix [ɛ] found on many nouns.
The low vowel also combines with the front [–ATR] vowel [ɛ] to form a diphthong in
nouns and adjectives with the frozen suffix (26a - c), or the diminutive suffix (26d - e), but not
tautomorphemically.

agreement for plural except in complementizer phrases. Also, tonal agreement for subject is
marked on a verb and an object where present. The plural in Bangime is a clitic [=nɛ] ~ [=ndɛ].
The homophonous marker [nɛ] is found as a singular in some Dogon languages, such as Yanda
Dom.
Another difference in the noun phrase is that the tone-lowering found on possessed
nouns, which is widespread among Dogon languages, is not found in Bangime. Although
complex tonal patterns are found in the possessive pronoun-possessed noun paradigms in
Bangime, tone lowering is not one of them. However, a tone-lowering process is triggered by
the definite article in Bangime.
Compounding is a productive means of creating new lexical items in Dogon. While
phrasal forms are common in lieu of one-stem lexical items, compounding as a process for
forming new lexical items is absent in Bangime.
Particularly in verbs, Dogon languages express inflectional and derivational morphology
through the use of multiple suffixes. Therefore, there is a significant difference morphologically
in the formation of verbs in Bangime and in the Dogon languages.
Forms for the word ‘I write’ in two Dogon languages are compared with Bangime in
(11). Shown in the examples, the negative imperfective and negative perfective aspect are
formed through a combination of suffixes in Dogon languages; in Bangime, the only difference
between the two sentences is the tone on the final vowel of the phrase. Note that the word for
‘write’ in each of the languages is similar, suggesting a borrowing if the whole Dogon word,
including the negative marker, is considered.","[42, 43]"
"Negation14.1 Overview of the Negative Marker
The negative morpheme [bíè] is the only means to negate a sentence. The negative marker may
precede a noun, acting as a negative copula. The negative marker may also follow a noun to
indicate lack of something. Verbs are also negated by the same marker preceding the verb. The
tonal effects of the negative marker and its placement in a sentence are discussed in this chapter.
14.2 Word Order in a Negated Clause
The negative marker usually precedes each constituent it negates.

plural forms among roots in the high tone stem type. The plural clitic takes a polar tone opposite
that of the noun. Certain vowels become [–ATR] before the nasal of the plural clitic.
3.3.2Tone Type Two: Low StemAs with Tone Type One, the low tone stem is common among monosyllabic nouns, but there are
six instances of low tone bisyllabic roots: [bìmmɛ̀] ‘heart’, [bòrò] ‘tomorrow’, [dèwò] (also
[déẁ] ‘mar’, [ɡànʤà] ‘fonio’, [ŋàmbà] ‘false sorghum’ and [tàŋà] ‘ear’. The tones on the noun

that the completive and perfective have suffixation but the incompletive does not. Another
example [dáà kúmbò] is translated as ‘has been searching’ (Tiga 1.72).
12.9 Phrasal Verbs
Many verbs in Bangime are phrasal in nature. As with the verbs that were shown to resemble
reduplication but actually took obligatory nouns as objects, some verb collocations are composed
of a verb plus an object noun. The examples in (404) use the noun ‘sleep’ with the verb ‘take’ to
express the notion of sleeping or freezing.",[295]

"42whether the people have any genetic relation to the Dogon as they claim. In the meantime, the
description of Bangime set out in this dissertation provides the only description of the language
thus far, and may help eventually in solving a greater mystery of the origin of the Dogon
languages as well.
The Dogon language group had been misrepresented as one language (Bendor-Samuel,
Olsen, & White 1989), but current research estimates 18 to 20 separate Dogon languages and
over 60 dialects (Heath 2008; Hochstetler et al. 2004). This diversity and complexity is due to
the Dogon peoples’ geographic inaccessibility; they have until recently been confined to
secluded, sometimes concealed, villages within the rocky Bandiagara escarpment and various
isolated nearby mountains. Although Marcel Griaule, his team members Germaine Dieterlen and
Michel Leiris and his daughter, Geneviève Calame-Griaule, have published studies on a variety
of topics since the 1930s, including the Dogon languages, much of this work is widely criticized
by those who dispute Griaule’s methodology (van Beek 1991). Their generalizations about
Dogon language and culture based on one language do not apply to the rest of the Dogon area.
Even Leiris (n.d.) found Griaule’s badgering of speakers inappropriate and unproductive, leading
to incorrect data. Many of Griaule’s Dogon language consultants have now admitted to playing
games and misleading him. Publications on Dogon languages from Leiris and Calame–Griaule
continue to be criticized for top-down elicitation techniques.
The classification of languages is critical to tracing cultural history and lineage (Blench
2006). The Dogon languages lack certain features, such as a full noun class system, that are
common among languages of the Niger-Congo family, to which the Dogon languages have been
assigned, causing some historical linguists to doubt their common ancestry (Williamson &
Blench 2000). Further, the classification of the Dogon languages has fluctuated between the Gur43or “Voltaic” (Bertho 1953; Greenberg 1963) and Mande (Delafosse 1952) sub-branches, but
since significant links with either remain inconclusive, they are now not linked with any
subgroup (Gordon 2005), which makes determining their history difficult.
1.11 Organization
This dissertation provides a description of aspects of the morphophonology of Bangime. Since
this is the first published description of the language, the first chapter is dedicated to providing
an overview of all aspects of the language in comparison to surrounding languages, particularly
those in the Dogon group since it is among them that the language is spoken. The phonetic
inventory of the features found in the language is covered in 2.1. Chapter 3 illustrates noun
stems and their underlying segmental and autosegmental representations based on their behavior
with accompanying clitics. Nouns are divided into six segmental categories and six tonal
categories. Evidence is inconclusive at this time as to the link between the segmental and
autosegmental categories and there is at least one nominal suffix which has an undetermined
meaning. Known nominal clitics and suffixes are presented in Chapter 4, and pro-clitics follow
in Chapter 5. The tonal interactions between morphemes associated with the noun and nominal
stems are thoroughly discussed. Word-formation processes that go beyond the stem are shown
in 6.1. The main non-affixal word-formation process is the genitive construction. Compounding
is not a means available in the language, thus two nouns are connected with the genitive
morpheme, a nasal which takes the place of the initial consonant of the possessed noun. Genitive
constructions can act as stems semantically in that they may be modified or affixed in a manner
similar to stems. However, the phonology of the genitive construction acts as a phrase. Chapter
7 gives an overview of the modifiers found in the language. Adjectives must modify a noun; an
adjective does not surface in isolation. Quantifiers act in the same way, but a difference lies in a44plural NP as the plural clitic follows the entire NP in the case of an adjective, but follows the
noun and precedes a quantifier. There is only one negative marker, which may precede or follow
an NP. Because the same negative marker negates a verb phrase, it and its tonal effects are
presented in the final chapter, Chapter 14. An unusual attribute of the language is the fact that a
noun as an object in a verb phrase is tonally affected by the subject of the phrase. The person
marking is often not overtly marked but is marked tonally on the object noun. This is presented
in Chapter 13.
The second part of the dissertation covers the verb phrase. Because the tense, aspect, and
mood (TAM) system of the language is complex, it is broken up into three chapters. The verb
root is introduced first in Chapter 8. Verb roots are abstract representations of an underlying
form; a verb stem always emerges with tense, aspect, or mood and person tonal marking. Links
between form and meaning of proposed underlying verb roots illustrate that verbs may have even
more abstract underlying forms which indicate general senses, such as movement or types of
actions. Verb roots are grouped into five basic classes based on the ways the inflectional affixes
affect the verb phonologically and semantically. Chapter 9 presents the verb particles, which,
along with the inflectional categories presented in the previous chapter, specify the tense and
aspect of a sentence. In Chapter 11, the word order for each TAM category is presented. The
derivational categories of verbs are presented in Chapter 9. Some verbs may be reduplicated and
some must surface with an obligatory nominative accusative as an object. These verbs and the
manner in which they appear with other constituents in a sentence are shown in Chapter 12. The
tonal patterns on the verb phrase, the person marking on the verb and object nouns, are shown in
Chapter 14.","[61, 62, 63, 64]"
"ʒáɣé+ɛ̀onion68Verbs with roots which end in a velar stop, such as those shown in examples (58a - c),
mark the perfect with a change of vowel for the final suffix rather than the stop-nasal sequence
alternating with the nasalized approximant shown for the verbs above.
The velar nasal occurs both word-initially and word-internally, although it is usually
followed by a stop word-medially. Word-internally, the voiced velar stop contrasts with the
prenasalized voiced velar stop as shown in examples in (59).

/w/ before both consonants. The /w/ remains phrase-finally in (61b). Also note (61a) that the
incompletive particle /daw/ deletes its vowel unexpectedly before the following vowel.
Examples (61c - d) show regular and apparent under-application of the glide-deletion process
respectively in the copula, thought to be the same particle as the incompletive /daw/. The

second example is not expected to be deleted before the vowel. The final pair (61g - h) shows70another instance of under-application and regular application before a voiceless stop. Two of the
examples above in which the word-final glide is deleted (61a, g) contain a syllablic nasal.
2.4.3Glottal ConsonantAlthough the glottal fricative /h/ is included in the phonemic inventory of Bangime, it is
generally found only in words borrowed from Fulfulde or Arabic.
[h]2.5StemGlossa.hùⁿpostpositionb.háⁿirrealis particlec.háuntilToneBangime is a tonal language. There are two privative tones, high and low. The tone-bearing unit
is the mora. On monosyllabic words with two morae, level tones may combine to form rising or
falling melodies. Rising tones may appear on monomoraic syllables in word-initial position.
Rising tones on monomoraic words usually appear after a velar consonant. A phonetic mid tone
which is the result of a non-automatic downstep predictably appears on the final syllable of a
bisyllabic word when the initial syllable is heavy and carries a high tone. The mid tone
represents a downstepped phonemic underlying high tone in this position (cf. péɛ́!rɛ́ (62b) versus
déɛ́mɛ̀ (62a), and the absence of HH.H toned CvvCv indicated in (62)). 33
Most stems in Bangime surface with a pitch change at the syllable or mora break;
however, shown in (63), there are exceptions to this generalization. Verbs always surface with aThe possibility that a mid or downstepped tone occurs in lieu of a high tone in other contexts has been explored in
depth and I am still debating the issue as the data are variable and thus remain inconclusive. I leave this matter to
further research.

nouns surface with a tone that differs from their underlying tones, as shown in detail in Chapter
3. Stems which contrast solely on the basis of tone are typically found among monosyllabic
stems (63a - e, aa - ee), but examples of bisyllabic words with the frozen nominal suffix which
contrast for tone alone are shown in (63f - ff).

weed, pull outIn the previous chapter, verb stems were organized into five main classes, largely based on
the patterns of suffixation of an underlying /–r–/ with an unspecified meaning. The suffix [–r–]
is found after vowel-final roots in the completive aspect. A nasalized allomorph [–r–̃ ] occurs
after a root that ends in a nasalized vowel in the incompletive aspect but as [–d–] in the
completive aspect. In roots which end in an alveolar or a bilabial nasal consonant, the222allomorphs [–d–] and [–b–] occur, respectively, in all TAM forms. The [–r–] suffix is not
productive; most verbs in which [–r–] is found do not have stems with unsuffixed counterparts.
9.3[–r–] Suffixation: Motion SalientThere is one verb which does have a basic stem and an [–r–] suffixed stem which can be used
interchangeably, as shown in the sentences in (261).

It was shown in §2.2.4 that there are no monosyllabic Bangime words with non-nasalized
high back vowels. Thus, I analyze the stem [baa] as the counterpart of [bu–r–aa]. 49 The same
speaker gave both forms with the same translation, ‘go away from’. While the meaning of [–r–]
is still not completely clear, with further examples shown in this chapter, I propose that the suffix
contributes the meaning ‘salience of motion’. As shown in the sentences in (261), the forms
[baa] and [bu–r–aa] are only interchangeable in the completive and incompletive aspects; in the
perfective, only [bu–r–aa] is used, and neither is used in the perfect.
Another use of the non-suffixed form [baa] ‘go away from’ is [báámà], a coalesced form
of the verb [baa] plus the word [ima] ‘here’, said to children or others to ‘go away from here’.
Further examples of the use of [bu–r–aa] to mean ‘move away from’ are found in Chief 1.5, 13,
Chief 7.8, Chief 7.52, and Tiga 1.1. The meaning of the stem [bu–r–aa] can also be changed to49Historically, this was probably bu-a, which became bwaa > baa.","[241, 242]"
"+ɛ–mi=nɛV.rr=nɛVI.–r=nɛNoun Types III and V involve frozen or lexical [ɛ] or [r], so [r] deletion before the plural
does not apply to category V. The diminutive suffix, frozen or productive, surfaces as [mi]
before the plural clitic in noun type IV. The plural clitic depends on the final tone of the
preceding morpheme for its tone; it is always the polar opposite.
3.2.1Plural AllomorphyThe plural has two segmental allomorphs, [ndɛ] and [nɛ]. The two plural allomorphs seem to be
in free variation, as most words were recorded pronounced with either form, even by the same
speaker. The most common instance of the plural clitic is [ndɛ] so the forms which were given
with [nɛ] are underlined or highlighted in blue throughout the manuscript, and are listed in (81).",[107]
"16I argue that the underlying form for ‘star’, and the other roots in which a change is observed, can
be viewed in the plural form. In many Dogon languages, the word ‘star’ is [tóró]. The reason
why the proposed underlying back vowel shifts front is one of identity harmony, as we see that a
word which ends in [o], such as [dòrò] ‘Doro (village)’, does not front the root-final vowel to [e]
before suffix [–ma] with a back vowel, [dòrò–má], ‘inhabitant of Doro’, not [*dòrè–má].
The word ‘onion’ [ʒáɡé–ɛ̀], plural [ʒáɣá–mì=ndɛ́], shows a similar pattern. The word
‘onion’ may also be a borrowing as it is pronounced [ʤábà] in some Dogon languages and
Bamana, as [ɡabu] in Fulfulde. The final vowel is apparent in the plural form.
Data documented by Roger Blench (2005, 2007), Stefan Elders (2006), Hantgan (2009)
and my work in progress are beginning to show that, while Bangime is not a Dogon language,
there is a hitherto unseen connection.
Indeed, as Calame-Griaule (1956: viii) states,
“D’un autre point de vue, l’étude du petit dialecte appelé /báŋeri mé/, parlé par une
petite fraction de Dogon à l’extrême Nord–Ouest du pays, et qui, bien que reconnu
comme «dogon» par les autres, semble présenter des caractères totalement
aberrants, serait fort utile pour établir des critères d’appartenance linguistique.” 16
I am in accordance with the view that Bangime is not related linguistically to Dogon.
The grammatical structure is almost entirely lacking in Dogon features, as shown in the
following subsections, which provide an overview of the main features of Bangime. The
estimated 20 Dogon languages and 60 dialects show clear linguistic correlates and geneticists
have recently published information concerning the genetic uniformity of the Dogon people
(Tishkoff, et al. 2009). In particular, one of the co-authors of this paper, Floyd Reed, states,“From another point of view, the study of the little dialect called Bangerime, spoken by a small Dogon group in
the extreme northwest of the Dogon-speaking area, which, although recognized by the others as ‘Dogon’, seems to
have some totally deviant features, would be very useful in establishing criteria for the linguistic affiliation of
Dogon.” (my translation)
1617“The Dogon (at least the samples from Bandiagara) have a very distinctive genetic signature
compared to other West Africans, so I think there may be a lot of potential to learn more about
the Bangande history from genetic studies” (p.c.). The following section provides comparisons
between Bangime and Dogon in other areas of the language.
1.8Language OverviewThe goal of this section is to provide a comparison to the Dogon language group and to give an
overview of the unique features of the language that support the classification of the language as
an isolate. This section provides an overview of the features that distinguish Bangime from the
Dogon languages and others within the Niger-Congo branch. The reader is encouraged to refer
to this section throughout the work, as it gives a brief overview of some of the defining features
of the language. The subsections include a comparison of the main aspects of the phonological,
morphological, and syntactic system of the language compared with other area languages.
1.8.1PhonologyHere I present the vocalic and consonantal inventory and alternations, and compare these to the
Dogon languages. The full phonological system of Bangime given in §2.1.
Bangime has seven vowels /i e ɛ a ɔ o u/. The vowel inventory of Bangime is similar to
the vowel inventories found in the Dogon languages. Vocalic processes differ in Bangime and
Dogon in that the former has disharmonic sequences of [+ATR] and [–ATR] vowels within a
word and even tautosyllabically. As shown above and in the comparative word list, words which
are otherwise to Dogon have a disharmonic vocalic sequence in Bangime, whereas the Dogon
word has a harmonic sequence of vowels. Although one would expect [ATR] vowel harmony to18be an active process in Bangime, as it is in most languages of West Africa, in Bangime it is not.
Other than before a nasal, disharmony rarely occurs among Dogon languages. 17
The lack of [ATR] vowel harmony is also unusual because most languages in area, those
belonging to the Niger-Congo language family, are known for their widespread occurrence of
[ATR] vowel harmony systems (Casali 2008).
The proposed consonant inventory for Bangime, compared with the most widely found
sounds among the Dogon languages, is shown in (6). Allophonic variants are listed below their
phonemes, and consonants which differ between the two languages, are in red and bold.

phonemes. However, a difference between the two is the labial-palatal approximant, /ɥ/, and the
alveolo-palatal fricative, /ɕ/, which are phonemes in Bangime. Neither occurs in Dogon and
fricatives in general are rare, if not absent, among Dogon languages. 18 Examples show the
alveolo-palatal fricative, /ɕ/, and the labial-palatal approximant, /ɥ/, occurring before vowels of
various heights and degrees of backness, only not before the high front vowels, as would be
expected if the segments were allophones of another phoneme. The voiced labiodental
approximant, [ʋ], is an allophone of a voiced bilabial stop /b/ in Bangime that may also have an17
Many of the [–ATR] vowels in Bangime appear before nasals or nasalized segments in potential borrowings from
Dogon languages.

One phonological feature which is shared with the Dogon is the lack of the voiceless labiodental fricative /f/,
though this could be a socio-linguistic phenomenon, since borrowed words are often pronounced with a [p], as the
Dogon substitute, or [b/β].","[35, 36, 37, 38]"

there are few verbs which have transitive-intransitive counterparts.
1.8.3SyntaxIn the syntactic category of Bangime grammar, the attributes of the language which separate it
from the Dogon languages are the word order changes based on the tense, aspect, or mood of the
clause, and the tonal indexing of the subject on the verb and object if present.
As noted above, in some Dogon languages, nouns agree in number and animacy with
adjectives and demonstratives, and verbs agree with pronominal-subject categories. In Bangime,
there is no other form of agreement except that the plural clitic marks both an NP and the relative
complementizer.",[49]
"HHLH/bʷɛ̀/legHHHH295As explained in Chapter 3, most polysyllabic nouns may not surface with their underlying
tones if the underlying tones are level, non-contour melodies. I propose that the same effect is
happening in the phrase. The first person indexes a high tone on the verb stem and the third
person a low tone. Phonotactic constraints that are yet to be determined dictate the placement of
the tone on a particular syllable in the stem or prevent the tone from emerging. The object noun
adopts a polar tone which is the opposite value of the verb. Because of the tendency for
polysyllabic nouns to surface with contour melodies, the adjacent syllable takes an additional
opposing tone.
Note that the nouns (438g - h) are in the same segmental and tonal class, and that the verb
has the same tonal behavior before both nouns. This also could also be due to the verb not
changing its tones whether an object is present or absent.
13.4.2 Bisyllabic Verb Stems
Examples are shown with the verb ‘lift’ and various objects to illustrate that the emergence of the
verb and noun tones differs depending on the object noun. The verb ‘lift’ has a high tone on the
root vowel for first person and a low tone on the root vowel for third person without an object.
The examples show the verb stem emerging exactly as was shown above when the verb did not
have an object. Both object nouns surface with the tonal pattern explained above, a polar tone to
the tone on the verb. The tonal pattern is not the same as the underlying form for this noun,
shown in (439).

The verb stems in (439a) and (439b) show the person tonal marking on the verb is on the
root vowel. Note the difference between the high tones on the perfective suffix which have thus
far been low. The object noun displays the expected tonal contrast; the first person is marked
with low tones on the final two vowels of the noun stem, and the third person is marked with
high tones on the first vowels of the noun stem. Again, neither noun reflects the underlying tone
of the noun stem (440).

The verb ‘throw’ was shown above to not change its tonal pattern in the first or third
person. Here it is shown that the verb patterns remain the same but the tone of the noun may
change. The first example (441) uses a noun that does change its final tone to the expected
pattern for the first (441a) or third (441b) person but the noun shown in (442) does not.","[314, 315, 316]"
"PLbɔ́jéɛ̀ síɛ́ndɛ́=ndɛ̀bùrá̃ síɛ́ndɛ́=ndɛ̀ʒímbéɛ̀ síɛ́ndɛ́=ndɛ̀Adjectives following singular nouns either surface with final downstepped tones (187a,
c), because a bisyllabic word with a heavy initial syllable surface as downstepped after a high
tone, or with low tones (187e, g). Before the plural clitic (187b, d, f, h), the tones of most
adjectives are high. As noted above, an adjective must follow a noun. If no noun is present, the
adjective follows the dummy noun [kii] derived from [keɛ] ‘thing’; the plural clitic always must
come after the adjective so an example such as ‘wide things’ is [kíì téŋó–ndɛ̀], not [*kii–ndɛ
teŋo].
Because the adjective is unbound from the noun stem, the noun surfaces before the
adjective with its singular, or citation, form tones. The examples in (188) show a variety of
nouns in the singular, plural, augmentative, diminutive, and plural diminutive forms with
adjectives to illustrate the contrast between the tonal effects of morphemes which are closely
bound to the noun and those which are less closely bound.",[195]
"2.1Phonological FeaturesIntroduction to the Phonemic Inventory of FeaturesBecause Bangime has very few productive, segmental morphological processes, allomorphy in
the traditional sense is limited. There is extensive variation, much of which appears to be
inconsistent. For this reason, the frequency of occurrence of each feature is given in the context
of where it occurs. This chapter lists and provides justification for the postulated phonemic
inventory of features in Bangime.
The vocalic inventory is illustrated in §2.2, followed by the consonantal inventory in
§2.3. Phonological processes which affect vowels include mid vowel laxing or becoming
[–ATR] before sonorants, front vowel raising in monosyllabic environments, and back vowel
lowering in bisyllabic words. Long vowels, (two vowels of the same quality and height), are
restricted to certain syllables in a word. In lieu of long vowels, diphthongs are common,
especially ones consisting of combinations of front vowels. Contrasting [ATR] qualities may cooccur tautosyllabically to form a diphthong. Consonants undergo phonetically triggered lenition
intervocalically and aspectually conditioned nasalization spreading.
Autosegmental features tone and syllable structure are presented in §2.5 and §2.6,
respectively. A minimal word length prevents underlyingly short vowels from surfacing in
monosyllabic words, but does not apply to clitics or affixes. Bisyllabic words have either two
light syllables or one heavy and one light syllable, but, with few exceptions, do not have two
heavy syllables. Trisyllabic words do not have heavy syllables. Geminate nasals are often found
word-initially but seldom word-medially. Glides in the nucleus of a syllable are moraic, but not
syllabic. Glides are tone-bearing in moraic position. The mora is the tone-bearing unit.",[65]

drumdrum beatervillage chiefThe initial example (171a) utilizes the noun ‘head’ with the agentive as a stem, which in
turn possesses the noun ‘village’. The phrase may also be stated with the nouns reversed so that
the village, in effect, possesses the chief: [díjà n déɡé ɕéɛ̀ⁿ], with the genitive nasal, but not with
the possessive proclitic *[déɡé ɕéɛ̀ⁿ máá=díjá]. The second example (171b) creates the noun
‘herder’ from the verb ‘herd’, which in turn acts as a stem to possess ‘goats’. The plural marker
may not be interpreted to to mark ‘goat’ or the entire phrase in this example. To indicate
multiple herders, ‘herders of goats’, both nouns would be denoted as plural.
Example (171c) is unusual since the language already has a nominalized verb for the
word ‘steal’. However, the term for a ‘thief’ is rendered with the agentive (171c). The genitive
alternative is impossible here [*kúùⁿ/kéwɛ̀rɛ̃ ̀ –ɕèɛ̀ⁿ ŋ kóɔ́kɛ̀]. The example (171d) also repeats the
word ‘drum’ and seems to topicalization on the action of the drummer beating a drum rather than
possessing one since the incompletive particle is used rather than the genitive nasal.","[182, 183]"

is a possible variation for (286aa).
Examples from narratives further illustrate the meaning of the stem. The examples
(284d) ‘put’ and (284dd) ‘put upon’ with usage shown in the narrative Text XII, Tiga 2.106,
show that the difference between the two verbs is one of valency. There is one example of the
verb [diɡa] ‘say, talk’ as [diŋɡi–nd–a], translated as ‘repeat’ (Tiga 1.156). Another, Text XII,
Tiga 2.6 is an example of ‘eat’ marked with [nd] yet it does not translate as ‘feed’ as (285a)
above, and in Line 52 of the same narrative the word [pɛre] ‘lead’ has the counterpart [pɛre–nd–
i] ‘explode, shatter, burst, smash’. This semantic relationship is one of going out or away from.
Further, the example above (284b) /ɡuwɛ/ ‘move away’ is likely related to the VC1 root /ɡuɥ/
‘throw’, which provides further evidence for the difference in verb class being one of
derivational affixation. Another example of the efferential morpheme is Tiga 1.34.
9.13 Case study three: Nouns from Verbs
The third use of a semi-productive suffix [–r–] is to derive verbs from nouns. It was noted in
Chapter 3 that many nouns with [–r] suffixes could also be used as verbs. In (287) are verbs
which are derived from nouns. It should be noted that all the verb stems have an [–r] suffix in
them, or an allomorph of the [–r] such as [d] (287aa - bb).

9.14 Overview of Affixation on Verbs
It was shown in the previous chapter that verb stems are grouped into verb classes according to
the suffixation patterns in inflectional categories. However, there are suffixes which have been
difficult to accurately gloss. In this chapter, possible meanings of the [–r] suffix were provided.
The [–r] suffix has been glossed as efferential following Newman’s (1983) discussion of
efferential meaning that so-called causatives in Hausa seem to indicate that an action away from
the speaker. The same process of an action away from the speaker is found in the relationship
between the verbs which are suffixed with [d], although not [r] (cf. the discussion of verbs of
movement). The meaning of the [–r] suffix on nouns may also be related to the [–r] suffix on
verbs since many nouns with the [–r] suffix are verbal nouns.","[255, 256, 257]"

(88k - l), or the glide-vowel allomorph (88h - j). Some diminutive nouns lose a final root vowel
in the plural, in addition to the final diminutive suffix becoming [ɛ], such as in (88b - g), possibly
because these words have underlying [–ATR] vowels. When the augmentative follows nouns
suffixed with the lexicalized diminutive, the frozen suffix may remain, such as in [ʒáɣá+ɛ̀–bɔ́rò]
̃
‘big onion’, but the [mi] allomorph does not appear in the plural form of the noun-augmentative
[ʒáɣá+ɛ̀–bɔ́ró̃ =ndɛ̀] ‘big onions’.
3.2.6Segmental Noun Type Five (rV, rV=nɛ)Type Five and Type Six nouns are also similar to each other in that the nouns in these two
classes have at least two syllables, one of which, usually the final syllable, has [r] as an onset.
As with the nouns which end in the suffix vowel [ɛ] and its allomorphs, there are two types of
nouns which end in a sequence [rV]: those which are a part of the root and appear in either
singular or plural form, and those which are suffixes and do not appear in the plural form.","[115, 116]"
"8.1Verb TypesIntroduction to Inflectional ClassesThere are 496 verbs in the corpus. Verb roots, like noun roots, do not surface without affixation
and tonal overlays. Most verb roots surface with either an additional vowel to meet the minimal
word requirement of two morae, or with morphological marking in the form of inflectional
suffixes. The tone of the verb stem, discussed in Chapter 13, is determined by the tense/aspect of
the clause, and the subject person marking of the verb phrase. Unlike the tone on noun stems,
the tone on verb stems is not clearly discernible by the affixation or cliticization of elements in
the verb phrase.
The inflectional morphology of the verb stem is based on the syllable shape of the verb
root, i.e., the verb without any suffixes. Verb roots are grouped into five inflectional classes with
the suffixation patterns for each type shown in the table in (234).
Inflectional Classes

Chapter 9, signify the aspect of the clause. The particle /daw/ marks the incompletive aspects:
the present and future tenses. The particle [kɔo] marks the completive tense which does not
naturally occur outside the realm of oral histories and tales. The particles [kɛ́ɛ̀] and [wɛ] indicate
the perfect for an activity verb, and the stative for change-of-state verbs, respectively. The final
vowel of the stem is a high vowel in the perfect and perfective aspect (the latter in Verb Class 4
only) and a copy of the root vowel (which is subject to height harmony as described in §8.2) in
the ‘default verb stem’, that which is used in all other tense and aspects. The [–r] and its
allomorphs [r ̃ ~ d ~ b] may mark purposiveness which occurred in a non-present time and is
discussed in Chapter 9.
This chapter is devoted to giving a description of the different types of verb stems, how
each of the verb classes patterns segmentally, and the affixes which follow each verb stem and
their meanings. Here, I show that the differences in the inflectional patterns on verb stems are
due to the underlying representation of roots. This idea is further developed in the next chapter
where I propose that the form and meaning of the verb roots are related. Each of the following
sections provides examples and lists verb roots for the five categories.
8.2Verb Class One: /CVCvelar/ or /CVr/Verb roots in Class One typically end in a velar consonant. The verb ‘hit’ /deɡ/ is a
representative verb for VC1. The verb root always surfaces with a final vowel so that the
syllable shape of the stem is [CV.CV]. The final vowel (RV) of the verb stem is determined by
the TAM category and the height, backness, and [ATR] value of the root vowel. Verb stems in
Class One are suffixed with either a vowel determined by the root vowel (235a - c) or the vowel200[u], as in (235d). 48 The transitive nasal marker precedes VC1 stems only in the incompletive
(235a) and completive (235b). Examples using the verb ‘hit’ in phrases are shown in (235).

"82Further, nasals serve to connect constituents, clitics, or a phrase, so the nasals found wordinternally could have once been grammatical markers between two words.
2.6.3Clitics and AffixesThe determining factors for discerning whether a morpheme is a clitic or an affix in Bangime are
syllable structure and the ability of other morphemes to intervene. Content words which are
unbound in Bangime include nouns and verbs. Adjectives must follow a ‘dummy’ noun [kíì],
which is a monosyllabic allomorph of the bisyllabic [kéɛ̀]. On nouns, the plural is considered to
be a clitic because it follows adjectives rather than a noun directly in a noun phrase. However,
the segmental and tonal properties of the plural marker tie it closely to the noun root in the
manner outlined in Chapter 4. Some nouns also are conjoined with frozen affixes shown in
Chapter 4 as well.
Other inflectional morphemes which follow the noun in the noun phrase are the
diminutive and augmentative. The diminutive is a suffix. The diminutive has segmental
allomorphs which are determined by the noun root. The diminutive has a low tone which
interacts with a noun root. The augmentative, on the other hand, is not a suffix or a clitic, but a
bound word. Derived from the adjective [boɡo], the augmentative [bɔrõ ] follows a noun directly
and no morphemes may intervene between it and the noun root. 36 The augmentative morpheme
does not contribute to the syllabicity of the noun root; it is toneless like the plural clitic and
receives a polar tone to that of the noun root. The augmentative behaves similarly to an adjective
in that it causes the genitive marker to be deleted in a genitive phrase.
The morphemes which are precede a nouns are the definite marker, a set of possessive
pronouns, and the genitive nasal. If one of the possessive prefixes or the definite marker36The possible Dogon counterpart of this word is [ɡara], ‘big’, or [ɡànà-rá̃ ] ‘to make smth bigger’, from Jamsay.","[101, 102]"

Dogon ɔrɔ̃ ɔⁿ → arã aⁿ → rã a → naa BangimeOnsetless syllables, common among Dogon languages, are uncommon in Bangime. As
in (5a), metathesis has occurred to form acceptable syllables in Bangime from those in Dogon.
Bangime words do not have codas. The example (5b) would undergo metathesis to form an
onset, and then the final nasal would become nasalization on the preceding vowel. Words with
nasalized [a] are found in Bangime, but nasalization of vowels is restricted. A mid vowel
becomes [–ATR] before a liquid, nasal, or nasalization. The example (5c) would undergo the
same metathesis process of (5a) and (5b), but sonorant onsets, particularly [r], are not permitted
in Bangime. The change in place and manner of articulation from [r] to [ɡ] is unusual, triggered
by the fact that the rhotic onset is impermissible, another instance is found in Bangime of a rhotic
alternating with a velar stop. The augmentative marker [bɔro]
̃ is derived from the adjective15[boɡo] ‘big’. 15 Next, by a process of vowel lowering, mid back vowels in Dogon systematically
appear as low in Bangime, and vice versa. As with (5b), the vowel raises to prevent a nasalized
low vowel from emerging. The final two cases seem to reverse the process.
Many Dogon languages do not have any words with a phonetic final, nasalized, low
vowel. Again, the change in manner of articulation in the initial consonant of the word is
without explanation, but the vowels of the Dogon word are assumed to be nasalized, as the word
begins with a nasal. Perhaps it is for this reason that the vowels could not remain as low. The
final example (5e) incorporates all the proposed constraints. Again, it is proposed that the
nasalization of the [r]̃ spreads onto the subsequent vowels. Metathesis occurs to provide an
onset, but a rhotic is not an acceptable onset, so the nasalized [r]̃ becomes [n]. Since the change
from nasalized [r]̃ to a nasal [n] did not occur in (5c), it appears that different processes occurred
in words which originated in Bangime and those which came from Dogon. Three different
scenarios seem plausible from the lexical similarities: (1) Bangime could have borrowed words
from a Proto Dogon language, (2) a Proto Dogon language could have borrowed words from
Bangime, or (3) both a Proto Dogon language and Bangime could have borrowed words from a
third source language.
Evidence for borrowing from Dogon also can be seen in plurals. In Bangime, many
nouns have a frozen, diminutive suffix. In polysyllabic words with a lexicalized diminutive
suffix, a root-final vowel changes its value when the diminutive suffix is followed by the plural
clitic.","[33, 34, 35]"
