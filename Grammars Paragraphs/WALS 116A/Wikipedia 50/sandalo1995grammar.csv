"Questions regarding categorical distinctions have occupied a central place in linguistics. Chomsky
(1986b and later works)makesa distinction betweenlexical categories. which are defined over thefeatures [+/-noun, +/-verb], and functional categories, which include the following grammatical elements:
complementizer, determiner, tense, and light verbs. According to Chomsky, cross-linguistic differences
are not random. but they are confined to a specific component of grammar. The parametric variation
across languages lies in inflectional categories rather than in lexical categories. Therefore, the proposal
that Salishan languages lack a lexical contrast between nouns and verbs is incompatible with Chomsky's
proposal.",[118]

"Parameters place limits on the ways in which languages may differ, thereby reducing the number of
grammatical hypotheses a child might consider in the course of language acquisition. Thus. the hypothesis
developed in this chapter has implications for language acquisition. According to Radford (1990:199).
""the earliest grammars developed by young children are purely lexical in nature"". That is, according to
Radford. child language is purely a projection of lexical categories. If this is true. we might expect
children to first assume that there are no pronominal argument languages. A question for further research
concerns the extent to which the grammatical development of children acquiring Kadiwéu is parallel to
that of children acquiring (for instance) European languages.",[137]
"!24In more recent work Chomsky’s uniform bar-level hypothesis. according to which the number of bars
for maximal projection is uniform across categories, has been questioned. For instance. Fukui & Speas
(1986) argue that functional categories are limited to a single specifier position and a single complement
position. By contrast, lexical categories project recursively as long as they have theta-roles to assign. In
other words. the projection of lexical categories has been assumed to correlate with their capacity to assign
theta-roles. Now, there are several pieces of evidence that verbs cannot assign theta-roles in Kadiwéu. Ifthe projection of lexical categories is indeed tied to their ability to assign theta-roles, that entails that
Kadiwéu verbs do not project.
My proposal is an extended version of Fukui & Speas' 1986 proposal. Fukui & Speas base their
parametric variation on the presence vs. absence of functional categories (FC). They argue that Japanese
lacks functional categories except for a defective INFL, which is defective in that it is not able to project.","[133, 134]"
*An alternative hypothesis is to say that the reconstruction proposed by Ceria & Sandalo reflects Non-noble Proto-Waikurian.rather than Proto-Waikurian.,[141]

"The metrical template in Noble Kadiweéu creates binary feet over syllables. However. an exclusive parsing into

languages concerning degenarate feet: (i) those which severely ban degenerate feet, and (ii) those which tolerate
degenerate feet. I argue that Noble Kadiwéu. unlike Non-noble Kadiwéu. bans degenerate feet.
A severe ban on degenerate feet makes predictions about possible word shapes. If a quantity-insensitive
language allow no degenerate feet at all. then there can be no monosyllables in this language.","[41, 42]"

Chapter 2 offers a description of the Kadiwén phonology, from both synchronic and diachronic grounds.
Kadiwéu has two dialects which reflect gender and social status: the most salient differences between
Noble and Non-noble Kadiweéu are at the level of suprasegmental phonology. Noble Kadiwéu parses the
word into binary trochees. Non-noble Kadiwéu presents a rare stress system: it parses the word into
iterative ternary feet. Comparison of Kadiwéu prosody with the prosody of the other Waikurian languages
suggests that Non-noble Kadiwéu stress patterns were introduced through interference from Portuguese
and/or Spanish. Chapter 3 comprises a detailed description of the grammatical morphemes found in thenoun and in the verb.
In chapter 4 [ discuss aspects of Kadiwéu morphosyntax. | present evidence that pronominal clitics
and affixes are arguments in Kadiwéu, and that nominal phrases are optionally adjoined to the sentence.","[137, 138]"
"1.1. Research goalsThe main goal of this study is to provide a general description of Kadiwéu using typological checklists as
guides. The South American Indian Languages Documentation Project Questionnaire (Kaufman & Berlin 1987) isa blueprint for the data collection, but [ also use selected portions of the 1977 Lingua checklist for more detailed
study of especially important and interesting features. Although these checklists do not provide for a completei ""The Nation, whose language is this grammar, was known by the following three names. First Waikurt: second Mbaya, third
Ejiwajegi. The two first names were used by the Spanish people, and were taken from Guarani; the third name is the Nation's
own name, and it refers to the ones who inhabit the country where the ejiwa palm grows.""",[12]
"Inalienablypossessednouns(Class [) must be preceded by apossessive marker. Table 9 presents the Kadiweéu possessives. and examples are provided in 114 and116. Theprefix /- is deleted before an alveolar consonant. and Gad:- and God:- are realized as Ga- and Go- respectively
before any consonant.[ use the label ‘indefinite’ here for indefinite possession. Observethat the Kadiweéupossessives are significantly similar to object markers. The similarities were even more striking in Mbaya
Ceria & Sandalo 1995).",[66]
"1.3. Use of the Results of this StudyAside from the value of having a grammar of a little-studied language in a little-studied family. the results ofthis research should serve broader purposes as well.
Neither the history of South American languages nor. in general, the languages themselves are well known.
The hope for a solid understanding of South American linguistic history depends on adequate descriptions of these
languages.",[17]

"By contrast, the actions expressed by verbs in a SVC are simultaneous, they express only one event.and all verbs must be interpreted as having the same tense/aspect. The same pattern has been observed in
other serializing languages (Sebba 1987).",[115]
"The complement of copular clauses in Kadiwéu is always a noun phrase. Kadiwéu does not have adjectives: all
non-verbal roots have identical syntactic properties. Elements which are expressed by adjectives in languages like
English are expressed by nouns (168-169) or intransitive verbs (170-171)in Kadiwéu (see 4.4 for criteria forlexical category classification).",[80]
Grimshaw proposes that verbs in English have an a-structure and are theta-markers.,[131]
"Most Kadiwéu verbs are not lexically specified for direction. The directionof the action is expressed by means of a prefix and a set of derivational enclitics. Another set of derivational
enclitics, which must precede the directional clitics. can be used to create motion verbs. [ classify these morphemes
as derivational because they can change the meaning of the verbal stem (note the meaning shift in 108). Like any
other enclitic in Kadiwéu, they trigger deletion of sonorant consonants. Table 8 presents the motion and direction
enclitics and prefix and 102-112 present some examples.",[63]

"392.4. SummaryThis chapter has offered a description of the Kadiwéu phonology, on synchronic and diachronic grounds.
taking dialect differences into consideration. Kadiwéu has two dialects which reflect gender and social status.
Noble and Non-noble Kadiwéu differ in that only Non-noble Kadiwéu has long semivowels.
The most salient differences between Noble and Non-noble Kadiwéu are at the level of suprasegmental
phonology. Noble Kadiweéu shows a pitch-accent system which parses the word into binary trochees: degenerate
feet are repaired into binary feet through reduplication. Noble Kadiwéu is quantity-insensitive. and therefore any
monosyllable is expanded into a disyllable. Non-noble Kadiwéu not only tolerates degenerate feet but also has a
different stress system. Non-noble Kadiwéu is a stress-accent language which parses the word into iterative ternary
feet. Moreover. Non-noble Kadiweéu is quantity-sensitive. Comparison of the Kadiwéu prosody with the prosody of
the other Waikurianlanguagessuggests that Non-nobleKadiwéustress patterns wereintroducedthroughinterference from Portuguese and/or Spanish. See Appendix 1 for further examples of comparative Waikurian
vocabulary (with reconstructions), and Appendix 2 for a comparison of Noble and Non-noble Kadiweéu lexicon.","[48, 49]"
