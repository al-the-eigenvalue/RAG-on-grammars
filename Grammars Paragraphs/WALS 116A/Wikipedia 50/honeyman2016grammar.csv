"350To the extent that Momu has an “alternative question” type construction
(König and Siemund, 2007), it is expressed by the juxtaposition of polar
question clauses, as in the example below. The answer to such a construction
is necessarily not “yes” or “no”, but encourages the hearer to select one of the
alternatives proposed by the speaker.

(10.42a) it occurs after the clause, while far more commonly that clause is
first marked with the restrictive =s, as in (b).

be coordinated to form “alternative questions”, but this time the disjunctive

the post-positive form is used.

10.3.2.3space-gamema-frog-storyConstituent questionsConstituent questions are formed with a question word (§3.5.5.2) used “insitu”—that is, in the position in the clause that the answer to the question
would fill in a declarative form. The clause is then optionally marked with
the question marker =a. There are two sets of question words, based on
their form, either starting with b (b-set) or m (m-set). The question words
are distributed unevenly across the two sets. A subset of the question words
can be used as modifiers to a nominal to form a selective sense (§3.5.3).
The question word byeku ‘what’ (or beku/b(y)oku) fills the constituent
position, with the appropriate relational case, to question the identity of
a referent. In (a) the subject is initial and unmarked. In (b), the themeoblique is marked with the oblique case. In (c) the instrument-oblique is
marked with the comitative case. (d) demonstrates a predicative use in an
identificational clause (within a quotative).

knows that the questioned object is on the other side of a divide, she just
doesn’t know exactly where, hence the proximal form can be used. More
commonly, such a question would require the speaker to use an irrealis progressive form, like afta ‘you are (location unknown)’ shown below, which
doesn’t use a deictic to (roughly) locate it.

"14.3Disjunctive coordinationThe coordinator for disjunction is o ‘or’ and is borrowed directly from tp o
‘or.’ It is a postpositive coordinator occurring after all coordinands, be they
nominal, phrasal or clausal. The disjunctive coordinator can be used interrogatively or non-interrogatively, and the diﬀerence is prosodically marked.
As a coordinated disjunctive interrogative, the function diﬀers from a polar
interrogative. It is instead an ‘alternative question’ form (§10.3.2).21
For instance, (14.51) gives examples of predicative uses of NPs that contain disjunctive coordinands. In (a) the rising intonation on both coordinators marks it as interrogative. In (b) the use is standard (declarative), and
the intonation on the coordinators is falling.
21
A disjunctive interrogative asks for a yes-or-no response while an alternative question
form asks the responder to select from the named set, or name an alternative.",[511]
"10.3.1DeclarativeDeclarative clauses are used to assert or report states of aﬀairs. These include
complaints, bragging, predicting and promising (König and Siemund, 2007).
Declaratives in Momu are the default, unmarked sentence type. There
is no specific marking, however the emphatic markers -e and -a are possibly a component of certain sub-types of declarative speech-acts. Further
investigation is necessary.
Declaratives generally take an (unmarked) rising-falling intonation contour over a simple clause type. However, as with every generalisation, there
are exceptions. Complex clause types such as coordinated structures have
more complex intonation patterns. In §10.3.2.4 I briefly review declaratives
with parenthetical questions mixed in. There is also a marked post-posed
participant strategy where the predicate has a terminal contour, and the
post-posed element has a marked rising contour (§8.1.3).1610.3.2InterrogativeInterrogative sentences are sentences typically intended as a request for information from an interlocutor. Interrogative sentences in Momu include
polar questions, where the veracity of an assertion is being sought, and constituent questions where content relating to constituents are being sought.
A reply to a polar question might be yo ‘yes’ or momu ‘no’, or something
in between.17 A constituent question (§10.3.2.3) involves a question word
(§3.5.3). A reply to such a question might minimally be the sought-after
constituent, or may mirror portions of the question as well. The example
below includes both a constituent and polar question. The first sentence
16There are definitely extra-clausal post-posed participants (topical afterthought), but
the pattern described is in addition to this. Further investigation is necessary to confirm
it however.
17
Between the absolute poles of true and false, replies can be epistemic in nature (e.g.,
aisena ‘who knows? / maybe’, or a form of the epistemic stance marker (§12.1.2.1)), or
even a question in return.",[377]
"4.8.2Oblique =mAny or all object and oblique arguments can be marked by the oblique.
The marking indicates that the NP functions as a non-subject argument.
Oblique-marking may be required, optional, or impossible according to the
situation. A combination of word order, oblique-marking and predicate type
is used to define both objects (§8.2.2) and obliques (§8.2.3). Adjuncts cannot
be marked oblique.28 The oblique can also mark sentential complements to
a variety of complement-taking predicates (§16).
A secondary function of the oblique by way of its optionality is as a
marker of new information. Non-subject arguments in a clause that are
clearly active in the discourse are often expressed by zero anaphora. Referents whose role in the clause is understood from context may be expressed
by an NP, unmarked for the oblique, as a case of topical reactivation (Lambrecht, 1996). Referents new to the discourse or unrecoverable from context,
or those for whom the speaker deems to be of an unclear role must be marked
oblique.
So, for instance, both the question word and the answer that fills the
same slot in a question-answer pair in (4.18) are necessarily marked with
the oblique. In the question and answer, oblique-marking is required. The
constituent question form is, by definition, a request for an unknown referent.
The response is a new referent (or role for that referent) to the hearer.
Admittedly, this could also be driven by dialogic parallelism that creates the
expectation that the response form should structurally mirror the question
(Evans, 2012).

The heterosemous free form meta(i) functions as a verb.9 Unlike the
bound inflection, this form takes inflectional categories, and it can be used
in serialisation, as in (12.15a).10 In this preverbal position it is often proclitic.
It can also stand alone as an inflected verb, as in (b) and (c).

9Diachronically, the form most likely comes from the fusion of the prefixing form of the

this may be a valid synchronic treatment of the free verb form. In Baron’s unpublished
grammar notes he records -meta as being optionally inflected for subjects (Baron, 1984).

12.1.1.3-me Hypothetical futureThe modal inflection -me indicates a possible or potential future action in the
interrogative mood. I have tentatively labelled it the ‘hypothetical future.’
The analysis here is correspondingly tentative, in the absence of enough
examples to provide a proper analysis.
The form is quite rare. I found it either in the context of meteorological events, or in questions of ability or potential. The hypothetical future
occurs only in interrogative mood and is the natural interrogative partner
to declarative uses of the epistemic future -meta (§12.1.1.2). Specifically, it
occurs in polar interrogative combinations. Most commonly this is the polar
question marker =fa (§10.3.2.1), but it also occurs in a few constructions
with subordinating uses of the restrictive marker =s (which in such contexts
often creates conditional clauses (§16.6.2)). For instance, it can occur with
the disjunctive o to create a kind of unfulfilled tag question ‘might it be or...
(not)’ (§10.3.2.2), or with the modal predicate =s on ‘might it seem that...’
(§16.1).11
When in a question–answer pair the corresponding positive answer is
marked with the epistemic future -meta.

the framework on conventional implicatures by Potts (2005), or theticals
(Heine, Kaltenböck and Kuteva, 2016). This is an under-represented feature
of sentence types in language descriptions, but at least a similar construction
appears present in the Trans-New Guinea language Oksapmin (Loughnane,
2009, p401).20 See also Kayardild parenthetical assertions (Evans, 1995).
20In example (11-39) in Loughnane (2009, p401), a referent is marked with the polar
question in the same fashion as described below.","[381, 382]"
"354It is reasonably common for the speaker to question the reference of a
participant in the middle of a declarative sentence. Both forms of polar interrogative are used parenthetically in Momu. In this use, a regular declarative
clause is interrupted by a questioning of the identity of a given reference.
The queried quantity is marked either with the polar interrogative =fa or
a combination of the restrictive =s and disjunctive o. These are delivered,
often without pause or change in regular declarative intonation. As such,
the explicit marking of elements makes it clear that the overall statement is
asserted, but specific sub-elements are still in question.21

In Kwomtari the form used for polar questions can appear finally or in second
position (Honsberger et al., 2008, p168). This appears to be a diﬀerent us
however to that given here for Momu, but similar to the way in which the
restrictive is used for subjunctive-like clauses. The Kwomtari form pe as
given is used for polar questions, hortatives, and more generally epistemic
modality.
21I have tried to represent this mixed sentence type in translation by placing a parenthesised question mark after the questionable element. Alternatively, a fully expanded
translation for (10.49a) might be “This one—is it this?—came.” This doesn’t represent
the degree of integration into the main clause, however.","[382, 383]"

Baibai corresponds to m in Momu, but I have several cognate forms where
an m corresponds directly to m, initially and otherwise. It is possible that
the situation may be more complex given the possible cognate “cloud/sky”
in (C.1). The initial b in the Baibai is also in the context of a phonemic
glide or phonetic high vowel, which may be conditioning the eﬀect.","[649, 650]"
"21also mentioned above the influence of the “etic grid” approach of stimuli kits
developed at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. These became
an invaluable source of exploration while on fieldwork.
While back at the ANU, a weekly “grammar group” became a platform
for a group of junior and senior grammar writers to discuss the grammar
of a broad range of languages and a broad range of topics. This group was
particularly formative for me, both in the exposure to other ways of looking
at the same problems that had developed in localised traditions of grammar writing,25 and in presenting arguments about grammatical structures
in Momu and in other grammars and typological papers in an environment
where they could be dissected by many interested minds. It was a fascinating
insight into typological variation, thanks to the many languages represented.
It was also an excellent avenue for discussion of just what a “grammar of a
language” could or should be.
When it comes to situating Momu in the linguistic world, I have tried my
best to describe the language in its own terms. In particular, I have tried to
strike a balance between the use of abstract representations of structure, and
long form prose as two tools that aid in modelling structure and expounding
meaning. My approach to grammar writing is, I think, unconsciously influenced by R. M. W. Dixon, who in turn had an influence on the generation
of grammar writing linguists in Australia by whom I was taught. Dixon
himself has named his approach as “Basic Linguistic Theory”, however, I am
reluctant to use the term. I believe that theoretical frameworks are models
that more or less fit a problem at hand. I very much agree with Dryer (2006)
that I am engaging with descriptive theory, rather than explanatory theory.
It is enough for me to attempt to answer the question of “what languages
are like” without being caught up in why.
There is very little literature or data available for languages putatively related to Momu, and so a diachronic consideration of Momu cannot incorporate a thorough application of the comparative method until some substantial
work has been done on the languages spoken around Momu. However, I tend
25For instance, the Oceanic tradition of grammar writing is very much grounded in
or perhaps served by the reconstruction of Proto-Oceanic. But also, the terminology,
distinctions and assumptions around broadly evident features of Oceanic languages are
assumed by insiders but at times opaque to outsiders. I don’t mean to single out Oceanic
languages here—discussing other languages and language families with other grammar
writers in the grammar group made it clear that this was very broadly the case for other
language families as well.","[49, 50]"

Morphologically, the deictic distinction is two-way, but if one includes the
irrealis progressive construction, the distinction across the progressive is actually three-way. By locating the participants in an event, the speaker (or
asserted knowledge holder) is indicating that in knowing where they are,
they have reason to hold that knowledge as real. In situations where this is
not the case, the speaker must use the irrealis form of the progressive.
Making an inflectional deictic distinction on verbs is unusual but not
unheard of. More commonly aﬃxal deictic distinctions might be considered
cliticised adverbial form, for instance, a rich system of spatial distinctions
including proximity which in some way aﬃx to the verb is not uncommon
in North American languages. For example, in Kwakwala, amongst a large
inventory of suﬃxes which “reflect the natural environment in which the
language is spoken” there is a suﬃx -em̀ ‘nearby’ which indicates proximity
(Mithun, 2001, p149). However, unlike the distinction required in the Momu
progressive, these are not obligatory categories. The Papuan language Berik
makes a two way distinction on verbs between an unmarked activity and
verbs marked with -tet to indicate that the activity occurred at some distance
(Westrum, 1988, p153).10
Diachronically, the Momu distinction is possibly closer to a grammaticalisation of motion verbs (§C.4). In the North American language Nez
10Berik also marks the spatial distinction of relative height (Westrum, 1988).","[284, 285]"
"462.1.4.1/Ve/ diphthongsThe three vowel-vowel diphthongs, /ae/, /Oe/ and /oe/ are perceptually close
to the vowel-glide diphthongs /aj/, /Oj/ and /oj/. Minimal pairs diﬀerentiating them are given below.
The starting points in the diphthongs /aj/ and /ae/ are quite noticeably
diﬀerent. The diphthong /ae/ sometimes drops the final vowel, especially
in heavier syllables, but because the fronted [æ] is still present, it is clearly
distinguished.
(2.10)/aj/:/aj/[P5j]‘you (sg.)’/ae/:/ae/[Pæe]‘be (anim.)’In /Oj/ and /Oe/ the starting point is the same [O], but the end point is
slightly diﬀerent.
(2.11)/Oj/:/sOj/[sOj]‘type of eagle’/Oe/:/sOe/[sOe]‘I exchange it’The starting point for the diphthong /oj/ is higher than /oe/, as it is pulled
higher by the glide (§2.1.4.2). In the next section I discuss diﬀerentiating
/oj/ and /we/ further.
(2.12)/we/:/jEsawe/[jĔsawi]‘sago palm sp.’/oj/:/moj/[mŨj]‘cassowary’/oe/:/foe/[foe]‘I open it’The VV and VG diphthongs can be further diﬀerentiated from each other
by their very diﬀerent interaction with suﬃxing morphology (§2.5).
2.1.4.2Mid-high vowel and glide diphthongsThe combinations of mid-high vowels (/e/ and /o/) with glides are a special
case. Although glides aﬀect the non-mid-high vowels only minimally, in the
neighbourhood of glides, mid-high vowels are realised as higher. In the most
extreme case—/je/ and /wo/—they surface as monophthongal long pure
high vowels (§2.1.4.3).
The combinations /jo/, /oj/ and /we/ are high ([ji], [uj], [wi]) or near
high ([jI], [Uj], [wI]) vowel diphthongs. /ew/ is unattested.
(2.13) /jo/: /Esjo/ [PĔsj ju] ‘dog’, /junje/ [jundi] ‘sun’
47(2.14) /oj/: /moj/ [mŨj] ‘cassowary’, /ojmo/ [PUjmõ] ‘I will cut it’
(2.15) /we/: /mwe/ [mbw wi] ‘cassowary’, /wenase/ [wIn˘ã se] ‘they swing’
The choice between the phonemicisation /oj/ and /we/ can be a little diﬃcult
to determine. While they contrast word-initially, elsewhere they are noncontrastive (and subject to variation). Take /mwe/ or /moj/ for “cassowary”.
Some speakers make a noticeable denasalisation of the initial nasal ([mbw wi]),
while others do not. Transcribing as /mwe/ with the glide next to the nasal
would be one way of indicating this denasalisation. Only a subset of the
consonants vary when followed by a glide, so, in this case, it is probably
safer to opt for the more generally preferred ordering of GV. VG ordering
only occurs word-finally in mono-morphemic words.
The sequences /ej/ and /ow/ arise only in a limited set of lexemes. Firstly
they only occur in the verbs /kej/ ‘eat’, /sej/ ‘urinate’, /nej/ ‘shoot one’,
/mOàkej/ ‘lay out’, /nafOfkej/ ‘carry on shoulder’ and /nokej/ ‘fill up’. These
verbs then have corresponding rounded third person singular subject forms
/kow/, /sow/, /now/ and /nokow/. Speakers refer to this as TP nek hevi
‘heavy voice’. The starting point of the diphthong varies a little from speaker
to speaker, with surface realisations of [Ij ⇠ @j ⇠ 1j] attested with corresponding back variants [Uw ⇠ @w ⇠ 0w].19For a subset of these forms in Eastern Momu, the possibility of the diph-thong arising via a linker vowel remains an open question (§2.4.5). This is
not an uncommon question amongst papuan languages (Blevins and Pawley,
2010; Jendraschek, 2012), and is made all the more problematic by phonemicisation choices of glides or high vowels, as demonstrated for Iatmul and
Kalam by Foley (1986, pp51–52).
19Baron (p.c.) gives several more forms in Western Momu (transcribed in the orthography used here): /fej/ ‘breast(milk)’, /aeEànej/ ‘talk secretly’, /àoànej/ ‘break up’,
/Esfej/ ‘leg’, /fEsnej/ ‘one’, /nafkej/ ‘carry on shoulder’. Many of these (non-verbal)
forms I record as long high vowels (/je/ or /wo/) rather than /ej/ or /ow/. This may
be a side eﬀect of the general flattening of the vowel space (§2.6.2). Some forms have
other diﬀerences in Eastern Momu (/Esfej/ : /Eàsje/, /nafkej/ : /nafOfkej/). Almost all
forms are verbs, and this means that the underlying form is confirmed by glide-consonant
metathesis which results in root-final glides being moved from a coda position to the onset
of a suﬃx, and separated from the diphthong (§2.5.1.1). It may be this morphophonological feature that has helped preserve this unusual diphthong in Eastern Momu in higher
frequency verbs.","[74, 75, 76]"

parents, wondering when the chick will first emerge from the nest. Ordinarily
this would be a volitional act and the volitional future -mu might be used
instead, but the modal flavour of this utterance is more that the parents
are wondering when the chick will be able to emerge. In (b) from the same

words—unless they are subjects.

9(11.38a) includes a copula use of the existential verb (§11.12.3).
Predicative adverbial clauses are rare. The example in (11.38c) is not ideal because
it is disrupted by a parenthetical question.
11
The examples in (11.38) are all identificational. Stassen (1997) argues that these are
not predicative, or at least that they are not predicative in the sense applied to other
predicates in this chapter.
10376Finally, there is a range of minor phrasal construction types that serve as nonverbal predicates. For instance, the phrase fes eru ‘that’s all’ is commonly
used to indicate that a story is finished. Although the demonstrative eru

it in another scenario. In the example below it combines with the subject

whether the predicate is verbal or otherwise. The “modal negative” 12 onfa
is verb-like in that it takes a single oblique-marked complement. The other
negator is the two-place predicate momu (§12.2). Because the modal negative takes a clause as its complement, the range of possible clause types that
can be negated using it is broader. The negative predicate momu, on the
other hand, only expresses negative possession.","[403, 404, 405]"

1.1The Momu language and its speakersThe Bewani Ranges are in the north-western corner of Papua New Guinea, in
Sandaun Province. They stretch from the border with West Papua eastward
to the Torricelli Ranges. At the eastern end of the Bewani ranges, there are
two strings of villages—one each on the northern and southern slopes. Momu
is spoken in these villages. An intricate web of tributaries flowing from the
ranges has created vast deltas on either side. Some maps indicate that the
language spreads north to the coast, but this is not the case. The villages are
spread out over a large area, with as little as an hour’s walk, but sometimes
up to two day’s walk between them. With so much distance, intermarriage
or other direct contact between the eastern-most and western-most villages
is unheard of.","[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"

form. These verbs are used either (3.32a, 3.33a) in serialisation to form ‘how’
questions or (3.33b) nominalised and then used as per other question words.
The intransitive form can also stand alone as a predicate (3.32b).26

I have no diachronic explanation for the remaining segments (na(nu)) in
the forms mena ‘where’ and me(na)nu ‘what’. The form me(na)nu does
bear some resemblance to the proximal approximative demonstrative anenu,
and while further work is needed to confirm it, appears to express a similar
approximative sense:
(3.34) Bekubeku menu-e,

‘What kind of food might there be in the kitchen?’3.5.42008.188DemonstrativesMomu is a language where few demonstratives perform a large number of
functions (Himmelmann, 1996). Demonstratives function pronominally, adnominally and adverbially in Momu. The demonstratives are given below,
with the demonstrative manner adverbs also given for comparative purposes.
26Meyer is constructed with the verb-forming suﬃx -er and nominalised with the nominaliser -u. The transitive form meyer ‘how’ can also stand alone as a predicate, marked
with the volitional future in a fixed expression, meyemu ‘Oh well! (lit. somehow we will
do it).’109See also §3.6.1 for an expanded treatment of a functional class of demonstratives.","[136, 137, 138]"
"28ate, some sentential complements can occur before or after the complementtaking predicate while others strictly limit complements to before the predicate (§13).
Sentence types are broadly diﬀerentiated by intonation, but questions are
also usually indicated by a final enclitic (§10.3.2). Imperatives have special
inflectional forms (§10.3.3). Declaratives lack a specific marker (§10.3.1), as
is very common across the world’s languages (König and Siemund, 2007).","[56, 57]"

In translating this form, speakers used both the Tok Pisin future marker bai
and the desiderative or inceptive laik for phrases like the above. With first
person subjects in particular, the form is clearly used to indicate intended
or desired action.
When used with a third person subject, the speaker indicates that they
believe that the agent wants or intends to carry out the action. In (12.7) two
speakers are trying to build a narrative around a series of pictures. In this
phase of the task, they do not yet know what the story is and are piecing
together the story one picture at a time. In establishing what is happening,
or what will happen, the volitional future form is used.

‘Yes, she will / intends to give a man something.’With a second person subject, the volitional future -mu is a mild imperative
(§10.3.3.2). The speaker implores the addressee to do something. (12.8) is
taken from a structured task where one speaker directs the other to place
objects in specific locations. Throughout the task the person directing the
393other used the volitional future rather than the stronger imperative form
-e/-a (§10.3.3.1).

A -mu marked clause is future-oriented with respect to a certain temporal origo, which is understood to be the time of utterance by default,
though other readings are possible in context. There are no grammaticalised
means in Momu for explicitly indicating the time of the predicated event or
state relative to the moment of speech. Instead, that time is constructed,
understood or inferred by the speaker from the context of the utterance. As
such, in the right circumstances, the matrix-level clause marked with the
volitional future can be understood to be indicating a past desire (fulfilled
or otherwise).
In the exchange (constructed in elicitation) below, two people discuss
shooting a captive pig. Speaker A establishes that someone has already
done this. In their response, speaker B uses Teb niymu ‘I wanted to shoot
it.’ In the context, that is understood as a non-future reference time.

‘Did/does he want to shoot it? I wanted to shoot it.’2008.337The volitional future is not generally used with non-human agents. Inferred
future events triggered by non-human causes are generally expressed via the
epistemic future -meta. The one exception to this is meteorological events.
These are sometimes marked as volitional acts, particularly in those cases
where the outcome is unfortunate for someone.
(12.10) is drawn from a text where Antonia talks about how the river is
constantly changing its path (to the point of causing mischief for the users
394of the river). At times, Antonia tells this from the perspective of the river
itself. Sometimes she uses the volitional future -mu for the whims of the
personified river.7 At other times the epistemic future -meta is used. In the
example, Antonia reverts to -meta after first using -mu.

‘How can you eat it?’space-gamebernard-christmasWhere sentential complements to complement-taking predicates permit a
limited amount of modal inflection, the volitional future is the most common
inflection allowed. Amongst predicates taking sentential complements, the
modal complement-taking predicates are of particular interest when combined with the volitional future. The combination of the modal negative
and volitional future expresses inability (§12.1.2.2). The combination of the
stance predicate and volitional future expresses desire or necessity, while the
stance predicate provides the overall modal and temporal frame (§12.1.2.1).
12.1.1.2-meta Epistemic futureThe “epistemic future” marker -meta indicates possible events, outside the
control or intention of the agent, and outside the knowledge or control of the
speaker. This includes events where something accidental might happen as
in (12.12a), or where the outcome is out of the speaker’s hands (b).8
7The river in this text is also marked as animate by the form of the existential verb.
The river watches the people washing in one location and then moves so that they have
to move again to collect fresh water and wash.

In this example, the speakers have just finished a task, and one asks the other if they
have performed the task correctly. (b) is the response.","[420, 421, 422, 423]"
"11.1.1Subjects and non-verbal predicationsAll non-verbal predications take a subject in Momu. Some predicates place
predictable restrictions on the form or semantics of the subject. Some select
for human (animate wholes), and some for non-human subjects. Amongst
the many forms of possessive predicates (§11.4, §11.5) there is a specific
possessive construction where the subject includes a possessive modifier
(§11.4.2). Abstract predications like temporal adverbial clauses probably
only allow a demonstrative pronoun as their subject (§11.8).
Complex subject NPs are possible, but the full extent of available forms
has not been investigated at this stage. The status of embedded phrases, for
instance, is unclear at the moment, but deverbal clauses can occur as the
subject of an attributive:
(11.1) Fyi
tity
fwas-u
emsu.
water ahead bathe-nzr good
‘Bathing first is good.’2008.195It is unclear if complex subject NPs can occur with any other non-verbal
predicates. See also the adverbial uses of the deverbal clause (§16.5.1, §15.7).
Zero-anaphora is extremely common in Momu, and perhaps more so in
non-verbal predications. Because of this, the majority of the natural ex360amples in my corpus have elided subjects. For instance, in (11.2), the subject
of the first question is the subject of the second question, expressed via zeroanaphora. ‘Esyufa?’ would equally be a valid utterance for a completely
new referent in the discourse if accompanied by an appropriate gesture.
(11.2) Nepu anu bu=a? Esyu=fa?
animal this who=Q dog=ynq
‘What is this animal? (Is it) a dog?’ma-frog-storyWhere possible I give examples where the subject has not been elided. In
many natural examples the subject is a demonstrative pronoun. For that
reason, where a full noun phrase fills the subject slot, it is often an elicited
example.1 In examples where elements are topical and elided, this is reflected
by placing the translated equivalent between parentheses.
11.1.1.1Topicalised subjectA topicalised element optionally precedes the subject.2 Generally speaking,
this topic slot can be filled by many diﬀerent elements, but for non-verbal
predicates, the range of possible elements is restricted by the nature of the
construction. Most commonly, the topicalised element is the subject NP
or an adverb. With external possession type constructions, I argue that
the topic slot is filled with an NP denoting the possessor (§10.2.1). When a
subject is topicalised (i.e., placed in the topical position), the subject position
is usually empty. It is possible but rare for the topic and subject slots to be
both filled with coreferential NPs.
Relevant to the present discussion, subjects are frequently expressed as
focussed3 by the focal marker =ne (§4.8.9). Many examples in this chapter
include focussed subjects, as in the example below. Where possible within a
free translation, I place the portion corresponding to the translation of the
elided elements in parentheses.
1
I mention here the nature of the examples in this chapter as in many ways this is
an unnatural skewing against the statistically most common form of usage of non-verbal
predications in Momu.
2
By topic, I am referring to the discourse pragmatic notion of a grammatical element
called the topic, as so labelled by, for instance, Lambrecht (1996). I am not talking about
the broader extra-sentential notion of topic. for a proper elaboration of the notion of topic
see §8.2.4.
3
By focus I am referring to a discourse pragmatic category. For a proper discussion
and definition of this category see §8.2.4.","[388, 389]"
"252(7.7)123sgai-taa-f-taai-tadua-rai-taa-mi-taa-fi-tapla-r/t-taa-m-taa-si-ta-(sa)The inanimate progressive is defective for first and second person subjects,
because of semantic incompatibility. A specialised use of the verb for caused
locations does allow animate subjects (§13.2.3.3). These additional local
subject cells are therefore greyed in (7.8). It is not clear that the same local
cells can be filled for the irrealis form in (7.9), however.8(7.8)123sgy-o-yay-ow-af-uy-o-woduy-o-rai-uy-o-mi-uy-o-fi-uply-o-r/t-uy-ow-am-uy-o-sa1
(7.9)23sgwu-taduwu-fi-taplwu-si-ta-(sa)Verbal aspectual suﬃxes (§7.5.2) can occur inside the progressive. I take
this to be a sign that these suﬃxes are a component of a single lexical form.
This is a useful tool for diﬀerentiating serial verb constructions in various

"408As these are the only examples of such TAM marking, and because there
are non-grammaticalised readings of the inanimate existential, further work
is necessary to clarify if these are actual examples of variation in the stance
predicate.
12.1.2.2=m onfa Modal negative predicateThe modal negative is a fixed form which takes no inflection.18 Variation
in the form of the sentential complement to the modal negative contributes
to the modal value. The complement to onfa may be a non-verbal predicate, in which case the predicate type determines the nature of the negation
(§11.9).19 The complement may also be a verbal predicate, in which case it
can be inflected for the imperfective, perfective, realis progressive, or volitional future (§12.1.2.3).
A plain unmarked (perfective) verbal stem with onfa conveys a meaning
roughly equivalent to a negation of the stance predicate (§12.1.2.1).20 That
is, the speaker uses the construction to indicate their stance on the matter as
being opposite (or diﬀerent) to the sentential predicate. Thus, the diﬀerence
between the form in (12.37) and a negative particle equivalent (fienu momu
‘It is not a lie’) is that the particle version is a statement of fact: it is not a
lie. The speaker knows or believes nothing of alternative possibilities. The
utterance in (12.37) is a response to disbelief.21

A verbal predicate of a complement to the modal negative can combine with
18The shape of onfa does not obviously indicate a verbal past but the marking of the
complement with the oblique =m does. Onfa may be related to the verb on ‘see’ with
the polar question marker =fa, but there is no compelling evidence for this.
19
In fact, for non-verbal predicates, onfa is the main form of negation.
20
In §12.1.2.1, I tentatively conclude that the stance predicate has a negated form
wu=momu ‘it is not the case that....’ The subtle meaning diﬀerence between this construction and use of onfa is certainly in need of further investigation, especially because
of the complementary stance qualities of onfa.

Note that this is not the irrealis form of the progressive—it cannot be combined with the modal negative. Given that negation describes a “non real”
situation, the usual expectation might be that an irrealis or subjunctive
should be used (Payne, 1985), especially in the context of a formally subordinate clause (Palmer, 2001).22 Palmer (2001) argues that the role of the
subjunctive in a negated context is of expressing doubt on the part of the
speaker. It may be that because the speaker is asserting a stance or position
counter to another, the realis here indicates surety on the part of the speaker.
If the speaker instead wanted to express doubt, the irrealis progressive form
of the stance predicate would be used instead (§12.1.2.1).
12.1.2.3Negative permission or potentialThe sentential complement to the modal negative onfa can only be marked
for the volitional future. No other modal inflection can be used. The meaning
conveyed by this combination is one of (12.39a) negative permission or (b)
lack of potential.

For the remainder of this thesis I will be adopting the practical orthography
shown in Table 2.19. I will no longer place these between angle brackets
(<>).
The h will not be marked after this chapter, except where I need to
contrast a known minimal pair. The diphthong ai will occasionally merge
with a in situations where there is a predictable truncation of the glide
(§2.5.1.2).
The distinctions between various combinations of glides and high vowels
may be collapsed to just i and u in the remaining chapters. This is because
this thesis incorporates data from earlier fieldwork before I could consistently
hear a diﬀerence in certain vowel qualities, but also because many speakers
that I worked with either do not, or only variably produce these distinctions
further compounding the problem. In examples where there is no source
identifier (i.e., the example is common, and drawn from knowledge) or where
the year in the source identifier is 2010 or later, the distinction is consistently
51made. Where the source identifier is earlier than 2010, the distinction is
inconsistently made. See §1.6 for more on the format of source identifiers.
From this point onwards non-English words in the body of the text will be
italicised. Tok Pisin forms are preceded by tp. Unless I revert to bracketed
conventions for phonemes or phones, the reader can assume that they are
viewing data that is phonemic (although lacking in the distinctions I mention
above in subsequent chapters).
In example sentences, punctuation is meaningful. The absence of a final
period (.), exclamation mark (!) or question mark implies that the example
is a sentence fragment within a larger context. This is especially the case if
there is a final comma (,). Likewise, the absence of a sentence-initial capitalised letter implies a fragment—for instance, one taken from an embedded
clause. I have of course tried to minimise the use of such examples, but
for reasons of space (the more naturalistic Momu data in my corpus rarely
respects the constraints of a printed page), or because I lack an example
sentence otherwise, I have had to do this. At other times, an ellipsis (. . . )
indicates some redacted material. Nevertheless, in the interests of full disclosure, I have spelled out these conventions so that the reader is aware of
any changes I have made to source materials. In some cases, the reader
may wish to locate the original (§1.5) if they wish to confirm or refute my
findings.","[79, 80]"

joined by Fiona a month into the trip. By this stage, many of the people in
Mori village had moved westwards up onto Iwolo mountain. This location
is much closer to Savamui. Once again I continued to visit Savamui, but
mostly based myself with the families I had lived with down by the river.
Some troubles in the village meant that we had to move on from Mori, and
we took the opportunity to stay in Mumuru for two weeks at the end of the
trip.
In late 2012 I returned to PNG for a short trip to tidy up remaining
questions and to return many of the materials that I had collected over the
years. I stayed almost the entire trip in Mori, but I did manage to visit
Savamui once.","[46, 47]"
"12.2.1momu NegativeMomu is a simple negator when applied to verbal predicates. The form of
the negated verb is limited to perfective (unmarked) or imperfective-marked

indicate that one disagrees with with someone else’s assertion, or to invert
the assertion of a prior utterance, as in (b). If the polarity of the clause

plural subjects, but that this is not apparent in Laycock’s notes.","[661, 662, 663]"
"2.3PhonotacticsIn this section, I examine the distribution of phonemic segments (§2.3). The
primary question of this section is what sequences are allowed and not allowed relative to morpheme boundaries and relative to each other (Blevins,
1995). At no point in this section do I appeal to syllable boundaries in
discussing distribution (Steriade, 1999), as I consider the process of syllabification to be fed by the knowledge of phonotactics.
Sequences of phonemes are grouped as combinations of vowels, consonants (exclusive of glides), and glides. In §2.3.1, I examine the distribution
of vowels relative to morpheme boundaries, relative to glides and relative to
each other. In §2.3.2, I consider the distribution of consonants (inclusive of
glides) relative to morpheme boundaries, and importantly for Momu, clusters
of consonants arising from suﬃxing morphology. In discussing sequences of
52segments, I use the following conventions: C refers to a member of the set
of all consonants excluding glides, G is a member of the set of glides and V
is a member of the set of all vowels. K is the union of C and G. Parentheses
indicate that a segment is optional.
I give examples of mono-morphemic forms and then details of the extended distribution of segments that arise due to morphology. Throughout this
section, some examples will be marked with a small lozenge character (⌃).
This is an indicator that, to the best of my knowledge, the demonstrated
sequence only arises in polymorphemic forms.22
Words in Momu begin with a (C)(G)V. In mono-morphemic forms, words
end with V, C, G, or CG, and medially C((C)G) clusters are possible between
vowels. Taking into account possible suﬃxing morphology, this expands to
include CC(G) finally on verbs and GC on nominals, and CCK medially on
verbs. Medial GC sequences are rare but possible in compounds.
This section gives no phonetic detail, as I am concerned only with sequences of phonemes. Phonetic detail for sequences demonstrated here is
given in the section after this one, when I discuss their syllabification (§2.4).","[80, 81]"

in Momu, this confusion was driven by the fact that some of the verbs coding verbal number are used quite frequently—especially within serial verb
constructions (§13.3.4). However, initial counts were quite low. Presently
I have counted about 70 unproblematic verb pairs where I have confirmed
that a given form has a plural or singular counterpart, and there are many
others where the pattern remains unconfirmed. This question can only be
adequately answered with more thorough and broad lexicographic work. In
Momu such verbs make up about 30% of verbs recorded so far.30 This puts
Momu at the more extreme end of the typological space, though behind
Hunzib (at 40%) (Berg, 1995).
For the remainder of this chapter I look at the realisation of verbal number in Momu. In §6.6.1 I look more closely at the meaning of verbal number.
In §6.6.2 I look at the variable realisation of verbal number in Momu. In
§6.6.3 I address some issues relating to the theoretical status of verbal number as found in the languages of the world. In §6.6.4 I look at the rarer
instances of event number in Momu, and in §6.6.5 I look at issues concerning
the hybrid patterning of object prefixation and verbal number for transitive
pairs.","[254, 255, 256]"

"3.5.3Question wordsQuestion words are a functionally motivated class that bring together items
from diﬀerent parts of the grammar. The question words divide into two
sets which I label based on the common first segment for each set:
(3.31)
b-setm-setb(y)eku/b(y)oku‘what’me(na)nu‘what (approximative)’bu‘who’mena‘where’bekofuf‘when’menfuf‘when’meta‘how (manner) / why’meyer‘how’( bye‘whatsit’ )All forms, excluding meta and meyer, are nominal. As such, they can be
inflected for case (§4.8.1) and most can also modify a nominal (§5.1.4). All
forms can function as predicates to a clause.
The b-set of terms are seemingly built around bye “whatsit”,24 with some
mutation.25 The final segments ku and fuf on the forms for “what” and
“when” do not correspond to anything that I’m aware of. Bu “who” is
identical in form to the proprietive marker =bu. However, it is not clear
that there is a relationship between the two.
The m-set are built around the common initial segments me. This is the
same as the hypothetical future modal marker me which is both suﬃxed
and also prefixed in some cases (§12.1.1.3). The form meta ‘how’ is a verb
and was quite likely a verbalised form (using -tai, §6.3.1) or a hypothetical
future prefixed form of tai ‘do’. Note that it is identical to the epistemic
24
The “whatsit” form is used to refer to an entity or entities that the speaker is having
diﬃculty recalling. Note that an identical form is used adverbially to express denial of
permission (§9.6.3)
25
Glides in the context of bilabial trill are subject to some inter-speaker variation. I
presume the b-set forms are built around the “whatsit” form bye, with the who form bu
being transformed by a suﬃx -u (either nominalisation or the genitive). The variation in
the form of “what” can be accounted for by the rounding eﬀects of the bilabial trill, such
that bye > (bw e) > bo.",[136]

In his most recent writings on Momu phonology, Baron (2007b) noted
that obligatory labialisation may accompany the bilabial trill. Phonologically, this raises the question of whether placing a perceived /w/ after the
bilabial trill may be redundant. In forms like /àasO/ [àw asO] ‘child’ the labialisation is there, but it seems stronger to me in forms like /àwamO/ [àwamÕ]
‘younger (same sex) sibling; sister’. For now, I will include /w/ when it is
perceptually stronger.
Denasalisation triggered by glides is shown in Table 2.14. Denasalisation
varies from speaker to speaker. In the least eventful form, a glide between
10Labialisation behaves very similarly in Imonda and Kwomtari (Honsberger et al., 2008;
Seiler, 1985). Velar and labial consonants followed by /u/ are labialised, and the vowel
sometimes loses syllabicity.","[67, 68]"

‘M: (That) might be his food.’ (epistemic assertion)
(12.29d) is an identificational clause (§11.2.1) with a topically elided subject
(the referent having been clearly established at this point). Identificational
clauses lack aspectual or modal distinctions, but embedded within the complement to the irrealis progressive form of the stance predicate it can be understood to be a currently held state of aﬀairs which the speaker considers
likely to continue to hold. In making the utterance in this form, Monica
establishes her subjective opinion in this turn of the discourse. This triggers
a progression in the dialogue: they move on to a new topic immediately.14
The stance predicate takes a limited range of aspectual and modal inflection. The meaning expressed by the stance predicate can be roughly
paraphrased as “(it is / was / might be) the case that ...”, which correspond
to forms of the predicate marked irrealis progressive (wuta), perfective (wu)
and volitional future (wumu) respectively.
The predicate is fixed upon the third person singular subject form. The
complement to the stance predicate is marked with the oblique case. The
complement itself may be perfective (§7.2), volitional future (§12.1.1.1) or
take realis progressive (§7.4.2), if verbal. The complement can also contain a
non-verbal predicate (§11) as in the example above, which expresses universal

to contrast a proposition as exclusive of an existing set. Restrictive clauses
are the potential topic counterpart to the backgrounding, contrastive, or
resumptive (actual) topics of focus clauses (per Haiman, 1978).
As a marker on noun phrases (§4.8.8), the restrictive functions similarly
to divide or contrast referents. In the example below, Monica and Antonia
are talking about an image with two speech bubbles. One is above a man,
and the other above a woman. Having established the owner of the first
speech bubble, Monica contrasts the owner of the second one as diﬀerent to
the first.

‘Yes, and this (other one) is his wife’s.’513When applied to clauses, the restrictive operates in a similar fashion. A
potential proposition is put forward and coupled with a potential outcome
should the proposition hold. In texts, a counterpart to the hypothetical
and its outcome are often given. For instance, in (15.45a), Yarin talks of
a hypothetical man who is well behaved, and listens to his elders. This
man is helped. In subsequent clauses, Yarin explains what happens to a
(generically) ill behaved man should he find himself in the initiation ritual
described. In (15.45b), Monica describes the behaviour of a mother around
a hypothetical newborn, and contrasts this with a hypothetical toddler.

A restrictive-marked deverbal or non-verbal clause is an “unreal” conditional
(Thompson, Longacre and Hwang, 2007). The above examples both involve
non-verbal predicates, as this appears to be the most common usage. Subjects need not be identical between the conditional and main clause. Both
the volitional future and the epistemic future can be marked on the main
clause to indicate what would or could happen.

clause.

Modal-marked subordinate clauses are marginal at best and are restricted
to the volitional future. Most speakers rejected the elicited forms given
below. A similar meaning can be achieved by intonational coordination of
the clauses below, without the restrictive marking.","[540, 541, 542, 543]"
"405In either case, the situation is externally mediated and out of control of the
speaker, but the epistemic future is used only with the matrix level form of
the similarity construction. The volitional-future-marked form of the stance
predicate in (a) indicates the speaker’s subjective opinion of the future state
of aﬀairs.

a subset of perfective or imperfective marking. (12.33) gives examples of the
combination of a volitional future complement of an imperfective stance predicate. In this combination the sense conveyed is more of desire or intention
than of a future act. This layering of outer epistemic modality with inner
dynamic marking is similar to that found in stance marking in Abui (Kratochvil, 2011) where demonstrative adverbs have grammaticalised as varying
modal markers (including epistemic stance).","[433, 434]"
"12.1ModalityCore modal categories are expressed across three loci in Momu: (a) a set of
inflections on the right edge of the verb (§12.1.1), (b) a set of (partially) grammaticalised predicates that express mostly (inter-)subjective modal meanings389(§12.1.2),1 and (c) a handful of adverbial forms expressing modal meanings
(§9.6).
The sites of modal marking are sketched in the templates given in (12.1).
A verb is first formed as laid out in §6.1.2 A single modal inflection (§12.1.1)
is optionally marked. These inflections are the core of the modal system.
The verb can further be embedded in a sentential complement to a modal
predicate. These operations are more marginally modal, and most are oriented towards stance. Modal adverbial modifiers occur optionally before the
verb (or predicate).
(12.1) (M.ADV) VERB (-M.INFL) (=M.PRED)
Not considered here, but potentially overlapping with modality, is the progressive (§7.4). The progressive in Momu is a multi-morphemic complex of
categories. In addition to coding ongoing activity, the progressive codes a
distinction between realis and irrealis. For the realis progressive, relative
distance (proximal and distal) is also marked.3 This is the only position in
Momu grammar where such a realis/irrealis distinction is made. That is,
Momu is not a language like Amele (Roberts, 1990), or (closer to Momu)
Kwomtari (Honsberger et al., 2008), where there is a clear, morphologically
coded contrast between realis and irrealis (Foley and Van Valin Jr, 1984;
Roberts, 1990). In this regard, Momu is similar to the Papuan languages
Imonda (Seiler, 1985) or Mian (Fedden, 2011), where, if there is “irrealis”,
then it is extremely limited, and is possibly of little explanatory use.412.1.1Modal inflectionsMomu modal inflection distinguishes between what I term the volitional future (-mu) (§12.1.1.1), epistemic future (-meta) (§12.1.1.2), hypothetical fu1The “modal predicates” in this chapter (§12.1.2) are revisited in §16.1 and re-examined
in the context of other complement-taking predicates. The majority of the modal predicates in this chapter code (inter-)subjective modality.
2
Verbal inflection includes the aspectual categories (§7), and argument cross-reference
(6.2), both of which occur closer to the verb stem than modal inflection.
3
An alternate analysis, as found in a number of languages of the Americas (cf Cristofaro,
2012, and references therein), is that a three-way deictic distinction is made: proximal,
distal and unknown or unlocatable. In this case we can put aside the progressive for
consideration here.
4
Fedden (2011) ultimately rejects “irrealis” as a useful category in Mian while Seiler
(1985) argues for a lone irrealis marker constrained to the same environments as in Momu
(questions, conditionals, some complement-taking predicates). It is clear in Imonda that
there is not a pervasive distinction, however.","[417, 418]"
"528refers to the source of the information. The object to the transitive form
refers to the recipient of the information.
In all cases here, if one considers the speech complement as filling an
argument position, then the utterance complement is oblique according to
the criteria laid out in §8. For reported speech, the argument status or even
embedded status of such a complement is often disputed (De Roeck, 1994;
Thompson, 2002).
In order to be consistently interpreted as utterance predicates, the complement to these verbs usually follows the verb. Unlike many other complement clause types in this chapter, there is no complementiser.2 The form
of the complement is sentence-like (§16.6), and shows no restriction on the
marking of categories on the complement. The utterance is often accompanied by voice quality and intonation consistent with an independent clause.
All of these factors combined indicate that in Momu utterance complements
are the least syntactically integrated of all complement clauses, to the extent
that it is questionable whether they are subordinate at all.
Other strategies exist for conveying reported speech. A reference to the
source via an NP, followed immediately by the complement, or even just
a shift in voice quality in the absence of an utterance CTP can indicate a
shift in footing such that the hearer understands that the speech of another
person is being conveyed.

"6.2Cross-indexationHaspelmath (2013) has proposed a well-ordered set of terminologies to describe bound person forms. He is motivated by the lack of precision in traditional labels such as “agreement”, which carry with them analytical assumptions that I too wish to avoid. Haspelmath makes a three-way distinction
by combining variation of bound person markers (“indexes”) and optional,
absent or obligatory co-referential nominals (“conominals”). Indexes in combination with optional conominals are “cross-indexes”; indexes with obligatory conominals are “gramm-indexes”; and indexes without conominals are
“pro-indexes”. The most common type cross-linguistically are cross-indexes.
182In Haspelmath’s terms, Momu is a language with subject and object
cross-indexation of conominals. Within the framework, the term “crossindex” implies that conominals are optional.1 A simplified version of Momu
cross-indexes is given in Table 6.1, to plot the necessary distinctions. Object
cross-indexation in this table is abstractly represented, as the full form of
the verb-forming suﬃxes are not shown (§6.2.2.1, §6.3.3.1).

ninTable 6.1: Subject and simplified Object index sets
Subject cross-indexes (§6.2.1) make finer distinctions in number than object cross-indexes (§6.2.2.1). Subjects are cross-indexed for singular, dual
and plural number. Objects distinguish singular and plural number. Comparing Momu with Baibai (§1.1.1, §D.1), dual distinctions appear to be a
recent innovation not present in Baibai.
Distinctions in person between subject and object cross-indexes are uneven as well. Subject cross-indexes distinguish first, second and third person
across all number values. Object cross-indexes distinguish local and third
person.
I use “local person” as a shorthand for the combination of grammatical
first and second person in a single form.2
A secondary system of object cross-indexation is available in the form of
1
Naturally there are cases where the conominal is not “optional”. Haspelmath (2013)
anticipates this in his paper. In Momu, conominal interrogative pronouns are a necessary
part of forming constituent questions (§10.3.2), and conominal comitative pronouns are a
necessary part of reflexive constructions (§10.2.3).
2
The distinction is problematic but well recognised in the literature, albeit with differing labels. For instance Silverstein (1976) breaks down the diﬀerence with a binary
feature +/- participant. Dahl (2000) diﬀerentiates egophoric and allophoric reference (or
later non-allophoric and allophoric (Dahl, 2008)). Haspelmath (2013) (building upon Dahl
(2000)) diﬀerentiates locuphoric reference from allophoric. I follow Aissen (1999b, inter
alia) in giving the combination of first and second persons the label “local person”.","[210, 211]"
"3.5Minor word classes3.5.1Spatial postpositionsPostpositions in Momu are limited to a pair of spatial terms (§3.5.1). At the
clause level these postpositions signal that the overall phrasal unit is functioning as a locative oblique (§8.2.3). Postpositional phrases can function
adnominally in locative NPs.
The spatial postpositions are niny ‘above/on’ and tin ‘inside’ (3.28).
These postpositions occur in complementary distribution with relational
markers such as the oblique and directional cases, (3.29). Additional spatial
distinctions are otherwise made by spatial nominals (§4.4) or verbs (§3.6.2).

first, second and third persons (§4.1).23 In addition to this, personal pronouns can be marked with the comitative (§4.1.1), genitive (§4.1.2), or both
(§4.1.3). There are additionally special emphatic forms that are fused with
the reciprocal-emphatic adverb ak (§4.1.4). Finally, there is a unique and
rare third singular form wotine ‘s/he, for his part’ (§4.1.5).
Momu does not generally employ a relative pronoun unless a possessor of
an alienable referent is relativised. In this case, a genitive-marked pronoun
is used as a relative pronoun (§15.1.3). There is a single indefinite pronoun bekubeku ‘(some)thing(s)’. This is a reduplicated form of the question
word beku ‘what’—a common source of indefinites in the world’s languages
(Haspelmath, 1997, p179). The demonstratives also function pronominally
(§5.4.5).
23
The dimensions of the personal pronouns diﬀer from argument cross-reference in lacking a dual distinction (§6.2.1). Conversely, there are several syncretic patterns in both
subject and object cross-reference (§6.4).","[134, 135]"

steven-luke4.6Kin termsKin terms are used to refer to or directly address individuals via their culturally mediated kin relations as calculated from a specific anchor. This anchor
130can be the speaker (especially for address terms), or some other referent
(Dahl and Koptjevskaja-Tamm, 2001).
Various kin terms are given in this section with translations in an abbreviated form.14 The terms in §4.6.1 are addressive (i.e., terms used to
address the relevant person directly) but a subset are also used referentially
(i.e., terms used to refer to a person), while the terms in §4.6.2 are exclusively
referential, as calculated via a third person anchor.
Referential terms are further built from these two sets of terms, as shown
in (4.14). The addressive term in (a) is straightforwardly drawn from the
addressive set. The referential variants depend upon the person of the anchor that the kin relation is built upon, as indicated by a genitive pronoun
(§4.1.2). A first person anchor builds upon the the addressive term and
employs a first person genitive pronoun (combining with e.g., to ‘my’). A
third person anchor builds upon the third person referential term (e.g., masu
‘his/her mother’), although the genitive pronoun (wobu ‘his/her’) is often
dropped for a third person anchor where the referent is contextually retrievable. The second person anchored form is built from either the addressive
or referential term. Further work is needed to determine what conditions
the choice, however. Note also, that where the addressive term is used, it is
usually a truncated form (e.g., mi instead of miyo), if available.15
(4.14) addressive and referential variants for M
(a) mi(yo) ‘mother’ (addressive)
(b) mi(yo) to ‘my mother’ (referential)
(c) masu/mi abu ‘your mother’ (referential)
(d) masu (wobu) ‘his mother’ (referential)
Consistent use of Momu kin terms in Mori village appears to be in decline
(§1.1.3). The most consistently used terms are those relating to nuclear
14
P = Parent, C = Child, M = Mother, F = Father, Z = Sister, B = Brother, D = Daughter, S = Son, W = Wife, H = Husband, y = younger, e = elder, f = female ego, m = male
ego
15
Referential bases as described here vary from those described by Baron (1986). In
his notes he describes a second person anchored form as being built from a (truncated)
addressive term, but not from the third person referential form. So, while the addressive
term for F (in my own orthography) is ayow and the third person anchored referential
term is bafu, the second person anchored form is ay abu ‘your father’ rather than pa/bafu
abu as I have observed. Also diﬀering from Baron’s notes, the truncated forms appear
more acceptable in the area where I worked.","[157, 158, 159]"

layered over a deontic modal (§16.1.3). Non-verbal predicates of complements to onfa code simple negation (§11.9) rather than negated stance.
Both stance and its negated counterpart only allow realis progressive
complements. This strikes at the heart of the modal nature of these constructions in the terms that I defined for modality in §12 (i.e., that Modality
is a consideration of alternatives). While it may seem odd that a realis form
applies to a negated proposition (i.e., to something that isn’t so), it is in
the diﬀerence between the negation types that the reason for this becomes
clear. In the examples above, the perfective complement to onfa in (16.12a)
indicates that speaker asserts that a past state of aﬀairs did not hold, and
hints or implies the alternative: that this state of aﬀairs holds presently, or
perhaps in the future. The plain negated form in (16.12b) is less nuanced.
A past or present state of aﬀairs doesn’t hold, and no implication is made
about the present or future. Given such an explanation of onfa, employing
a realis progressive within the complement makes sense.
A realis progressive complement to onfa indicates that a state that the
speakers know to be relevant doesn’t hold at the moment of utterance. Such
an utterance implies, however, that it shortly will be so. In the example
below, the speaker is anticipating that what isn’t initially true at the time
will become so when the video he is describing progresses.7
(16.13) Bernard describes a video where he knows that the first referent in
this example is initially out of frame.

7Such constructions as that seen in (16.13) are hard to stumble upon naturally, let
alone reliably elicit. Further work is necessary to fully understand this form, including,
for instance, whether an implied inversion as a past state can be read into the form.","[562, 563, 564]"

First person singular subjects are unmarked, or if one prefers, are marked
by a null suﬃx. Third person singular subjects are marked by a morphophonemic operation that rounds the final vowel or glide segment or segments
of the stems (§2.5.1.3). Consonant-final stems have no suitable candidate for
rounding and are therefore unmarked. For these stems first and third singular person subject forms are syncretised. Stems ending in VV diphthongs
(oi, ui or ai) drop the final vowel in all but the first singular form (§2.5.1.2).
Subject marking triggers many morphophonemic operations which res184ult in a higher level of phonological integration into the stem (§2.5.1). In
particular, complex codas at the stem boundary are common due to subject
marking. Morphophonemic operations simplify these complex codas through
deletion, or by moving glides out of codas.
A separate form of the second person singular (-af ) and plural (-am) are
used in realis progressives (§7.4), and to form subjunctives (§15.7.1).
6.2.1.1A diachronic aside on subject markersThe subject agreement system of Baibai (§1.1.1) bears a strong resemblance
to Momu’s subject cross-indexes. The two systems are shown side by side in
Table 6.3, using data from Baron (1983) and Laycock (n.d.[b]). The source
data is given in §D.1. Comparable items are in bold.

Dual distinctions Baron marks the dual distinction in Baibai with a question mark in his survey while Laycock’s notes do not record a dual distinction.
In the absence of data to the contrary, I assume for now that Baibai has no
dual number category.
The putatively related Kwomtari and Biaka languages (§1.1.1) do not
have explicit inflectional dual distinctions for all three persons (Hamlin, 1998;
Honsberger et al., 2008). Nor do the forms used to mark subject agreement
bear resemblance to the Momu subject agreement suﬃxes. Kwomtari uses a
local person plural subject marker with a local singular pronoun to achieve
a dual sense (and may use an accompanying lexeme with the pronoun to
mark it as dual). Dual number marking is possible in Imonda and other
Warisic languages via a verb prefix (Seiler, 1985), but these are exclusive
185of person indexes. Rather, the system looks more like the verbal number
system of Momu (§6.6). Nai has a first person dual distinction bound up in
portmanteau modal marking (Hamlin, 1998).
Coastal languages of the region such as Barupu (Corris, 2008) or Puare
(Donohue, 2008a) more commonly make a dual distinction within subject
index sets. As Momu sits between the coastal languages and the remaining members of the Kwomtari-Baibai family, it is reasonable to hypothesise
that the dual distinction arose from contact with these or similar coastal
languages.
Common to all dual markers in Momu is a final i. The initial r of the first
dual -rai matches the first plural -r, and the initial m of the second dual
-mi matches the second plural -m. The third dual -fi appears less clear,
but possibly -si already being the third plural may have pressured the only
remaining single segment marker, the second singular -f, to be chosen for
constructing a third dual -fi.
Given the occasional marking or expression of a dual in local person
contexts in other languages in the family, it may be possible that a dual
distinction existed in an earlier state in either first person, or local person
marking before a third person dual was later innovated upon contact with
coastal languages.
The origin of the rounding process K in Baibai appears to have been
consistently elided in Momu (§C.1), and this may help to explain the origin
of the rounding process marking the third singular in Momu. This would
likely be via a two-step process of sonorisation (k > w) and then elision
which leaves behind a trace in the form of rounding.
If a labial consonant or glide were the proto-form for the reflexes k in
Baibai and ø in Momu, this may also help to explain the rounding of vowels.
Unfortunately, the data for Baibai are too scarce to draw a firm conclusion
about this.
First person distinctions The data on first person agreement in Baibai
is also too scarce to draw conclusions about whether or how it is marked in
that language. There appears to be a possible denasalisation of a stem-final
n in the Baibai data, or possibly a separate segment t for the first person
singular and plural. If the first person were marked in Baibai by t, then this
186would correspond neatly with the first plural marker -r/t in Momu.
Baron (1983b) hypothesises that the first person marker may have been
n. While this is not necessarily clear from the data he provides, there are possible stem-final n segments that would work with Baron’s tentative analysis.
See D.1 for the data showing this.","[212, 213, 214, 215]"

and (tye)nebem ‘two.’ Some speakers express ‘three’ as (tye)nebem ef ‘two
and another.’ As a modifier to a nominal, this is the extent of ordinary uses
of numeral sequences. As ascending counting forms, there are extended uses,
however.6
Occasionally speakers use gestures to hands and/or feet to indicate numbers roughly around 5, 10, 15 and 20. These larger numbers are often approximations.
The lexemes fasni/faskaney ‘one’ and (tye)nebem ‘two’ have diﬀerent
distributions, and do not constitute a word class on their own (§3.3.2).
Fasni/faskaney ‘one’ always stands separate to the expression of numeral
sequences. (Tye)nebem ‘two’ combines with itself, or with ef ‘and another’7
to produce larger numbers. Some basic phrase structure rules are given in
(5.41).
(5.41) (a) NUM.SEQ ! fasni/faskaney | (tye)nebem (ef )* | NUM.SEQ’
(b) NUM.SEQ’ ! (tye)nebem (ef ) (NUM.SEQ’)A numeral sequence may be made up of either the single lexemes fasni/faskaney
‘one’ or (tye)nebem ‘two’, or the lexeme (tye)nebem followed by any number
of the lexeme ef ‘and another’, or a complex sequence repeating by factors
of two or three.
Sequences representing the possible ways of expressing numbers up to 6
are given in Table 5.3. Speakers used one of four strategies for expressing

Through verbal and non-verbal tests designed to measure aspects of numeracy, I witnessed a handful of older speakers (amongst 30 test subjects)
who could utilise methods (1) or (2) to perform basic addition and subtraction tasks for quantities up to 10.8 Almost all younger speakers were unable
to use Momu numerals for addition and subtraction tasks. All strategies lead
to decreasing accuracy with higher order counts (up to 10), but strategy (3)
more so than (1) or (2). The ability to count backwards in Momu or Tok
Pisin was usually predictive of a degree of numeracy in the tasks.9 The
tasks were designed to identify counts of objects (and manipulation of their
number) with verbal and non-verbal prompts and responses.10
In his field notes, Laycock (n.d.[d], p249) records numbers up to four
(nebem afa nebem ‘two and another two’) and kwobo ‘many’ for speakers
from Mumuru village (and other undisclosed locations) versus numbers of
up to two (nebem) for a speaker from Mori village before getting responses
in Tok Pisin (Laycock, n.d.[d], p191).11 Given the heterogeneity of responses,
8With 10 subjects, I ran tests similar to those described in Frank et al. (2008). The
tests were nonverbal matching tasks, verbally directed “nuts in a can” tasks, ascending and
descending elicitation/translation tasks (verbally and nonverbally prompted), and verbal
and nonverbal assessment of numbers under addition and subtraction conditions.
9
By “numeracy” I mean here not the ability to identify and name quantity, but rather
addition and subtraction.
10
Note that Momu does not have a question word for querying quantities. For verbal
requests for number I used the tp haumas(pela) ‘how many.’
11
This is assumed to be a sample size of two across the two villages listed (Mori and
Mumuru), but it is possible that elicitation was undertaken with a group. I recorded a
greater degree of variability in both Mori and Mumuru.","[201, 202, 203]"

Note that for “we” I am choosing to compare what Baron (1983b) labels the inclusive

labels the exclusive form in Baibai.
5623C.1.5VowelsFor the most part, the non-high vowels correspond without issue. Momu
a corresponds with Baibai a, and e with E. o requires further explanation
in the context of back vowels, as do the high and mid-high vowels. Glides
within diphthongs correspond without issue.
The data here become quite messy as it is not always clear whether Baron
has transcribed phonetic or phonemic forms. To my ears, the Momu data
as given by Baron has collapsed several diﬀerent short vowels into a single
schwa vowel, and so this may be true of the Baibai data as well. The Baibai
data contains many schwas, and these often correspond to diﬀering reduced
or full vowels in Momu.
The way in which the data are transcribed implies the use of the same
orthography as Momu, making the same vowel distinctions (8 diﬀerent phonemic vowels, and more allophones). If this is true, then apart from having a
likely 7 vowel system (with a possible additional central vowel), then Baibai
also exhibits final devoiced high vowels equivalent to the devoiced glides of
Momu. The single example is kEsi which in Barons orthography is written
˚
kehsy. This roughly translates as “one”. It is possibly a mistake, as Laycock (n.d.[b]) does not transcribe any devoiced vowel in Baibai. Conversely
he rarely picks up on devoiced vowels in Momu. Both sources include final
schwas which might be candidates for variant forms or allophones.
C.1.5.1Back vowelsThe data for the back vowels are particularly variable. This might have been
a result of transcription error. For the most part back vowels correspond with
back vowels, as shown in (C.8) and (C.9). Note that u and o in Momu vary
in that u has many allophones while o does not (M: Momu, B: Baibai):624(C.8)(C.9)MomuBaibaiM u [o] : B o“woman”mu [mo]moM u [o] : B O“animal”nepu [n@po]n@pOM u [U] : B u“mosquito”gusiM u [U] : B @“bow”

anow is underlyingly anew and this makes the correspondence between o and
E in (C.10) clear. The remaining correspondences are diﬃcult to account for
however, except that there is a loose connection between them in the context
of w or k.

6Baron (1983c, p7), working from an analysis of rounding of a final high vowel spreading
leftwards (§2.5.1.3) represents a deduced underlying form for many ow sequences in his
work. For instance the form anow ‘big’ is represented as anew throughout, and the
corresponding surface form is [anOw]. Baron used underlying forms for representing some
forms in the data in Baron (1983b). This in some cases, makes the correspondence with
Baibai cognates clearer, but although likely, raises the question of whether Baron may
have mixed underlying analyses into the Baibai data as well.","[651, 652, 653]"

kaspar-kokomo12.1.2Modal predicatesModal predicates express a variety of modal qualities that operate over
the entire clause. All forms are more or less complement-taking predicates
(Noonan, 2007), some of which have fused or reduced. All show a degree of
402grammaticalisation (§16.3.2), either by a reduction in form or a reduction in
inflectional possibilities.
The components of these constructions in Momu are a sentence-like complement, a complementiser, and a complement-taking predicate (henceforth
the modal predicate). All three have variable forms across the construction
types discussed below.
12.1.2.1=m wu Stance predicateThe inanimate existential verb wu has grammaticalised as a form of epistemic
stance marking which I label (and gloss) the ‘stance predicate.’ The form
encodes the speaker’s subjective assessment of the state-of-aﬀairs described
by the complement, relative to a temporal oﬀset established by inflection on
the predicate.
Stance is a broad and varied topic across the literature (see Engelbretson
(2007) for an overview of diﬀerent approaches), but here I am singling out
just one component of stance. Following Engelbretson (2007) I take stance
to be a subjective, observable, interactional, indexical and consequential
phenomenon. As such, many examples of the stance predicate occur in
dialogic, natural and unscripted interactions between speakers, especially in
tasks like the social cognition picture task (San Roque et al., 2012), where
the speakers in one phase of the task are jointly attending to constructing
a narrative based on a series of images. Amongst possible instantiations of
stance, here the stance predicate codes mainly epistemic stance. Stance can
also code emotional attitudes and judgements of a given proposition. Such
meanings are coded by other complement-taking predicates in Momu, and
are examined elsewhere (§16.1).
In the simple exchange below, two speakers are working towards identifying the unknown elements in an image.13 Monica signals her tentative
position with the stance predicate in (d).
