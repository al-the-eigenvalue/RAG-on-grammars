"The last type of clause in which caa negation is used is in yes-no questions. As
can be seen in (278), caa precedes the pronominal subject even if the sentence is a
question. Yes-no questions and declarative sentences are structurally the same in Iquito.
The only difference resides in the intonation contour at the end of the sentence, with yesno questions displaying a rising pattern.",[188]

"4.3.1 Caa Negation
Caa negation uses the negative particle caa in the pre-subject position to negate
an entire clause. It is used in matrix clauses of declarative sentences and yes-no
questions. Diagram 6 below shows the structural position of caa in relation to other
168constituents of the clause. When there is a topic element in the negative clause, caa
follows this element; otherwise, it precedes a non-topic element.","[186, 187]"
"In (286), the negative particle caa both precedes and follows the verb marked with -ji.
The question word in the sentence is the direct object. The subject is a pronoun nu ‘3S’
and caa appears after it in the preverbal position, which forms the SXV word order to
express the irrealis mood. The indirect object remains in the postverbal position.",[193]
"In (284), caa precedes and follows the verb which is marked with -ji. The questioned
element here is the subject as well. However, the object nu-naana ‘his wood’ does not
appear between the subject and the verb, but remains in the postverbal position. In
comparison with the above example, the negative particle caa in the current example
appears postverbally as well as preverbally, forming a linear SXV Word order to fulfill
the requirement of irrealis mood. Compare this sentence with (286) below.",[192]
"The last point of this section concerns the imperative68 construction. Whether
imperatives are assigned to realis or irrealis mood in Iquito is an on-going question as
they demonstrate structural characteristics of both grammatical moods. An alternative
68 I use the term ‘imperative’ in the sense of directive illocutionary force, here including first person pluralhortative, second person singular imperative, and second person plural imperative constructions.",[178]

172In addition to wh-questions, relative clauses also adopt ji-caa negation. As can be seen in
(281), this sentence consists of a principal clause and a relative clause. In the principal
clause, the negative particle caa precedes the pronominal subject and in the relative
clause, caa follows the verb which is additionally marked with -ji.","[190, 191]"

the perception of the speakers. The current negation section does not include a theoretical
analysis of negation structure. For a proposed theoretical analysis, please refer to Lai
(2006b) for more discussion.
There are two principal strategies of clausal negation in Iquito: one uses the
negative particle caa (referred to as caa negation hereafter) and the other uses the
negative morpheme -ji in combination with the negative particle caa (referred to as ji-caa
negation hereafter). In caa negation, the negative particle caa precedes a pronominal
subject or a non-topicalized subject phrase, and follows a topicalized element if any. This
strategy is generally used in principal/independent declarative clauses and yes/no
questions. In ji-caa negation, the negative particle caa follows an inflected verb, in which
the verbal root is followed by the negative morpheme -ji, followed by tense and aspect
information. This strategy is generally used in wh-questions, relative clauses, and
embedded clauses of cleft constructions. While caa negation does not have variation in
irrealis mood, ji-caa negation varies structurally in irrealis clauses. The negative particle
caa in ji-caa negation may appear repetitively in the postverbal position as well as in
preverbal position if no other elements appear between the subject and the verb of an
irrealis clause (detailed in §4.3.2). In adverbial and complement clauses, either one of
these two strategies can be used.","[185, 186]"
"4.3.2 Ji-caa Negation
Ji-caa negation uses the negative particle caa, plus an additional negative
morpheme -ji attached to the verb root, to negate a clause. This strategy is used in the
following types of clauses: wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleft
constructions. Complement and adverbial clauses can adopt either caa negation or ji-caa
negation. In ji-caa negation, both -ji and caa contribute to the negation meaning. The
negative marker -ji is a portmanteau morpheme which encodes both the negation and the
clause-type information. The fact that it also conveys the negation meaning is supported
by two pieces of evidence. First, it is ungrammatical for it to appear in an affirmative
171clause; second, in some cases, caa is omitted while the clause still retains its negation
meaning. It is possible to consider ji-caa negation as a type of negative agreement since it
agrees with the type of the clause it occurs. However, it is unlike a typical inflectional
agreement marker for the following reasons. First, it cannot appear freely in any negative
clause, but only in wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleft
constructions. Second, it attaches to the root (as opposed to stem) form of the verb, which
indicates that it behaves more like a derivational morpheme in Iquito. Diagram 7 shows
that the negative particle caa follows the inflected verb and the negative morpheme -ji is
suffixed to the verbal root, preceding tense and aspect information.","[189, 190]"
"Diagram 7. The Schematic Structure of Ji-caa Negation
{subject} {verbal root-ji-aspect-tense} caa {object and other adverbial phrases}Ji-caa negation presents many variations in irrealis clauses. I discuss the basic pattern of
ji-caa negation and its variations below.
In the types of clauses introduced above, the negative particle caa follows the
verb. As can be seen in (280) which is a wh-question, caa is in the postverbal position
and -ji is marked after the verbal root, as part of the verbal complex. It is noted that -ji
appears after the verbal root to which only derivational morphemes attach. This suggests
that in Iquito -ji is considered a derivational morpheme.",[190]
(Laugh) Yes. Yes. Yes.,[609]
"4.3.3 The Scope of Negation and the Function of the Two Strategies
In addition to the syntactic characteristics (i.e. type of clause) discussed above,
there is a correlation between the negation strategy, the scope of negation and the
178pragmatic function: caa negation has scope over the entire clause while ji-caa negation
has scope over only the verb phrase, excluding the subject of the clause. For example, in
wh-questions, the wh-word is not negated; only the rest of the clause is negated. This has
much to do with the function of the two negation strategies: caa negation negates the
clause without focusing any element, but ji-caa negation focuses the first element of the
clause and negates the rest of the clause. This corresponds to the fact that wh-questions,
relative clauses and embedded clauses are similar to cleft constructions, not only
structurally (i.e. using ji-caa negation) but also functionally (i.e. generally interpreted by
speakers as clefts and the first element focused). Recall also the phenomenon such that
adverbial and complement clauses can adopt both negation strategies. In Iquito, the
syntactic status of these types of clauses can be treated as subordinate clauses as well as
coordinated clauses. In addition, it is noted that this variation also corresponds to
different pragmatic functions (i.e. whether the first element of the clause focused or not).
In the following, I start the discussion with a comparison between the structure of cleft
constructions and that of clausal negation.
Sentence (297) consists of an affirmative clause. As seen in (298), to negate a
principal or independent clause, the negative particle caa is directly placed at the
beginning of the clause, which is caa negation.","[196, 197]"
"Unlike caa negation, ji-caa negation presents many syntactic variations sensitive
to mood (i.e. in irrealis clauses). The negative particle in such clauses can appear after the
verb, as in the basic pattern, before and after the verb, or only before the verb in some
cases. Recalling the requirement of irrealis mood (i.e. one element should occupy the
position between the subject and the verb), when this requirement is fulfilled, then caa
173stays in the postverbal position, maintaining the basic pattern. When the object of a
clause is dislocated to form a wh-question, or stays in the postverbal position, the
negative particle caa appears between the subject and the verb, by which the requirement
of irrealis mood is fulfilled. Sometimes, when caa already appears in the preverbal
position, it does not appear again in the postverbal position. In each variation, the verb is
obligatorily marked with the negative morpheme -ji.
In sentence (283), -ji marks the verb, followed by the negative particle caa,
displaying the basic pattern of ji-caa negation. The wh-word is the subject, followed by
the object phrase nu-nasi ‘his garden,’72 followed in turn by the verb. This is the
configuration of irrealis mood (SXV word order).","[191, 192]"

"2.2 METHODOLOGY
This dissertation presents typological phenomena of TMA systems from the
literature and provides the Iquito data and analysis as a comparison to highlight the
language-specific properties and contribute to an overall understanding of TMA systems
of human languages. The analysis assumes Carlota Smith’s framework, as discussed
35above in §2.1. In this section, the collection of the data and the basic methodology,
including analytical criteria and tests, of how one determines the aspectual meanings in
question, are discussed.
Prior to the dissertation fieldwork in 2006 (May-December), I had already
collected some narrative stories, in addition to abundant texts collected by other ILDP
members and some elicited examples relevant for the study of the Iquito temporal system.
The data were obtained primarily during my own summer field research done in 2003 and
2005, and from the text collection of the ILDP.","[53, 54]"

with a few other speakers for other analysis-related opinions. The elicitation, generally
based on the above-mentioned questionnaires and modified sentences and questions from
the texts, and the consultation sessions, usually went together, so I transcribed as I asked
the questions. The estimated transcribed words number around 8000 in Source Language.
For the transcribed and annotated data, I use a 3-tier convention, including the first line in
segmentized texts, second line as gloss (i.e. morpheme translation and abbreviated
grammatical function), and the third line as free translation. One side note about the free
translations for the example sentences in this dissertation is that they represent the fruit of
quite nuanced discussions with the consultants. The analytical pertinence is the concern
here. The first free translation a consultant would give might be so fully-packed with
discourse information, just like any sentence one would utter in a daily conversational
context, that it includes additional interpretations or information which cannot be
obtained from the sentence itself and is not expressed through the temporal/aspectual
meanings of the morphemes under discussion. I would discuss the translation quite
intensively with the consultants to peel off the added interpretation and information not
yielded from the sentence itself and I would request them to give an as simple as possible
a translation. Through routine sessions and training, they could generally give the
simplest translation without adding unnecessary context, but they also usually
commented that the translation is correct but too simple, and is not a rhetorically
beautiful and complicated sentence. In addition, one difficulty exists in the line of
segmentized texts. The tone in Iquito operates on different levels and so it was the most
inconsistent part of my transcription, although fortunately the tone does not affect the
semantic and syntactic analysis at all.","[55, 56]"

"38In the following, I briefly discuss the precise analytical criteria (i.e. linguistic
correlates) and the semantic tests I employ in determining the various temporal and
aspectual meanings in question. The information introduced here should be combined
with the detailed explanations of the theoretical background and tests outlined in §2.1 and
in respective chapters and sections of different TMA categories. Smith defines the tense
category as an obligatory morpheme in the sentence. Temporal interpretation is directly
attained from tense in tensed languages. Therefore, the first criterion of determining
whether a morpheme in question is a tense is its obligatory status in a finite sentence. If it
is optional, most likely13 it is a temporal adverb. If a morpheme is truly a tense category,
even if a temporal adverb, such as ‘yesterday,’ which explicitly indicates RT, appears, the
tense, such as the past tense in English, is still required in the sentence and the lack of
such a tense would result in ungrammaticality. The second criterion I propose is the
compatibility of such a morpheme and temporal adverbials; this criterion also serves to
determine the temporal meaning of a tense morpheme. If a morpheme yields a past
interpretation, it could be a past tense or a perfective—or even an imperfective—aspect.
In tenseless languages which have grammatical aspects, a perfective sentence is by
default inferred as the past and an imperfective sentence is by default inferred as the
present unless additional information indicates otherwise. Therefore, a perfective aspect
can be combined with a future adverbial while a past tense cannot be combined with a
future adverbial. In other words, if the morpheme which supposedly yields a past
interpretation can be combined with a future adverbial, chances are that it is a perfective
aspect instead of a past tense. Likewise, if a morpheme which supposedly yields a present
interpretation can be freely combined with a past adverbial or a future adverbial, chances
13 Smith includes three types, in terms of tense, of languages in the world: tensed languages, tenseless
languages, and mixed-temporal languages. Mixed-temporal languages (e.g. Navajo) have morphemes that
function like a tense, but are not always required in a given finite sentence.","[56, 57]"
