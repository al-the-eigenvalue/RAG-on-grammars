The speaker is pointing out landmarks to his nephew who has been away for many years as a
slave among the Quinaults. Several sentences earlier we are explicitly told of the nephew’s ignorance of the area: ‘He [the addressee of (409)] did not know where they were going as they returned home, because he had become a slave when he was still small.’
Although the subject of the relative clause in (410) is grammatically first person, the possessive clitic signals that the subject is the possessor of the S argument (§7.3.4), the grandfather, who
is thus the referent whose status is at issue. This is the first mention of him in the text and the
relative clause occurs with the Indefinite Relative.

but only its identity. In (412), the first person referent is obviously already a discourse participant,
but his identity as a Kyuquot is emphasized by the Indefinite Relative.

The Indefinite Relative frequently occurs with the dubitative formative <(v)t9r to form
various types of irrealis relative clauses. The vowel of the Indefinite appears short instead of long
in this construction, which undoubtedly indicates some degree of grammaticalization in the combination of these formatives, though I do not find it necessary to consider it an entirely separate
mood as Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 242) do.
a) The dubitative Indefinite Relative is used in indirect questions after predicates expressing
lack of knowledge or understanding:

See Rose (1981: 226-29) for a more detailed account of the Indefinite in Kyuquot dialect,
where its functions have expanded somewhat so that it appears as a general indefinite mood in
non-relative as well as relative clauses.
7.2.15 Content and Polar Interrogatives (Makah)
Makah has a mood for forming content questions and another for polar (‘yes/no’) questions.104
The Content Interrogative attaches to an interrogative word like F`C`p ‘who’ or v@r` ‘where’,
which functions as predicate head. The word may be underived, consisting of an interrogative
root alone (all the interrogative roots are free roots) (416), or derived, consisting of the interrogative root plus lexical suffixes (417).

The Interrogative mood in Nuuchahnulth is used in forming both content questions and yes/no
questions. In content questions it attaches to an interrogative functioning as predicate head. As in
Makah, the interrogative may be underived (420) or derived (421).

Note that inclusion of the discourse particle v@ (obviously related to the verb v@ ‘say, tell’)
indicates a positively biased question, i.e. a question expecting an affirmative answer (422)a.
Negative bias can be indicated by the formative <F@ following the Interrogative (Swadesh
1939: 83). Unfortunately, this construction is not attested in the corpus.
The Interrogative can co-occur with the quotative formative C:

The semantic differences between the Inferential I and II moods are as yet unclear. In (424) the
Inferential II denotes discovery of the situation of the predicate. Evidential force arises from the
fact that the occurrence of the event is discovered on the basis of later evidence.

However, the Inferential I clitic can also have this sense.
One formal difference between the two clitics is that the Inferential II is frequently accompanied by pi@ ‘(be) thus, so’ (425) or the enclitic <pn9 (which may be a reduction of pi@, since
these two never co-occur in this construction), while the Inferential I only rarely is.

The addition of pi@ or <pN focuses on the unexpectedness of the results and gives the Inferential II the flavor of a mirative (Delancey 1997). Note also the co-occurrence with the Quotative in
(425)b.","[298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305]"
"355105There are a few examples of it attaching to a lone demonstrative in Nuuchahnulth, however,
e.g. F`GjTFh ‘that one’.
106
Tseshaht x@ is probably cognate with the morpheme g@ in Kyuquot dialect that Rose (1981:
40) describes as a definite article.
107
In Makah, the article itself may be extended by demonstrative elements: <?hp`9c proximate
article, e.g. PhcHkhp@c ‘this dog’, <?hp@b distal article, e.g. PhcHkhp`9b ‘that dog’.
108
See Rose (1981: 206, ex. 43; 209, ex. 60-61)
109
Rose (1981), Rose & Carlson (1984), Whistler (1985), Emanatian (1986), and Nakayama
(1997b) may be consulted for further discussion of passivization in Nuuchahnulth, especially the
controversy over whether this construction should be properly be considered a passive or an inverse. The reader will correctly infer from my labeling the morpheme in question “passiveinverse” that I consider the question to be terminological. The Southern Wakashan construction
simply mixes properties associated with constructions called “passive” and “inverse” in other
languages. It appears to be intransitive like the English passive, but is subject to person and topicality hierarchies like inverse constructions in Algonquian languages.
110
An obvious alternative analysis of this construction some have suggested describes ,(C)hK as an
object case marker. Rose (1981: 62-67) presents several arguments against such an analysis and
for a multi-clausal analysis like the one given here.
111
This is perhaps a typo for ,@bxhm, the normal shape of this suffix, cf. Sapir & Swadesh (1939:
319).
112
Makah has a morpheme ,""tW seems analogous to the Nuuchahnulth irrealis clitic, but it is not
yet fully analyzed.
113
In formal speeches first person singular forms may have plural reference (i.e. ‘I’ = ‘we’).
114
The classification of many words expressing property concepts is unclear. This uncertainty
primarily involves free roots like dimension terms, e.g. M, N F`p ‘wide’, M FhFHWi`, N FHGi
‘big’, and evaluative terms, e.g. M QtKT, N QtK ‘good’, and also some words with the durative
aspect suffix, e.g. M, N Ihrtj ‘white’, M, N F`C`ji ‘propped, wedged up’. Most property words
probably belong to a subclass of verbs, as proposed by Jacobsen (1979a), but some may constitute a separate class of adjectives (Rose 1981). Their syntax requires further investigation before
definitive classification can be made. Other property words such as those formed with suffixes I
have classified as verbalizing state suffixes (§5.4.1), e.g. M ,chs, N ,mhs ‘stocked with ...’, M, N
-h9b ‘belonging to ...’, are more clearly verbs.
115
Jacobsen (1979a: 84-108) includes a thorough review of various proposals concerning Southern Wakashan word classes in both the primary and secondary literature.
116
This is a different sense of “nominal” from the one used in the preceding list of word classes,
where the word simply means ‘having the character of a noun, noun-like’.
117
I therefore disagree with Nakayama’s (1997a: 64) contention that “...[T]here is no strong formal basis for positing word classes in Nuu-chah-nulth. That is, there is no unique and constant
correspondence between sets of words and formal markers or formal structuring patterns that justifies grammatical classes among words.”
118
Note also that this is a rare example of a post-head predicate modifier hosting a clitic.
119
The speaker is the mythological culture hero Kwatyaat, whose speech is characterized by inserted /x/’s (Sapir 1915, reprint 1949: 186; Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 210, footnote 8).
120
Jacobsen (1979a: 106) makes the same claim: “[T]he momentaneous [i.e. perfective––MD]
formation ... derives verbs from stems of other classes.”","[370, 371]"
"STUDIES IN SOUTHERN WAKASHAN (NOOTKAN) GRAMMARby
Matthew Davidson
June 2002A dissertation submitted to the
Faculty of the Graduate School of State
University of New York at Buffalo
in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy in LinguisticsiiiAcknowledgements
I have many people to thank for their contributions to my dissertation. First, I must thank the
people of Neah Bay, Washington for their hospitality and generosity during my stay there. The
staff of the Makah Cultural and Reseach Center and the Makah Language Program merit special
recognition for their unwavering support of my project, so thanks to Janine Bowechop, Yvonne
Burkett, Cora Buttram, Keely Parker, Theresa Parker, Maria Pascua, and Melissa Peterson. Of all
my friends in Neah Bay, I am most indebted to my primary Makah language consultant, Helma
Swan Ward, who spent many patient hours answering questions about Makah and sharing her
insights about the language with me.
My project has benefited greatly from the labors of my dissertation committee at SUNY Buffalo, Karin Michelson, Matthew Dryer, and Jean-Pierre Koenig. Their insights concerning both
analytic matters and organizational details made the dissertation better than it otherwise would
have been. Bill Jacobsen, my outside reader, deserves my gratitude for his meticulous reading of
the manuscript on short notice, which resulted in many improvements to the final work. Thanks
also to Jay Powell, who facilitated my initial contact with the Makah. I gratefully acknowledge
funding for my research from the Jacobs Research Funds and the Mark Diamond Research Fund
of the Graduate Student Association of the State University of New York at Buffalo.
Thanks to all my friends in graduate school, Wendy Baldwin, David Houghton, David Kemmerer, Alissa Melinger, Greg Gulrajani, Eve Ng, Holger Diessel, Julie Olenn, who made my
years in Buffalo intellectually stimulating as well as a lot of fun. Tom Graves deserves special
thanks for friendship above and beyond the call of duty and all those bottomless cups of coffee at
Waatch and Buffalo.
Finally, I thank my father and mother, Robert and Mary Davidson, and my sister Sharon, for
their support in this and all other endeavors in my life.","[1, 2]"
"1Makah is the usual English rendering of the Clallam (a neighboring Salish language) designation for the tribe. In their own language, the Makah call themselves pihchCC`F@sW and their language piHpiHchCC`p. Both words are regular formations based on the root pihchCC`,p,, a place
designation of uncertain reference (Renker & Gunther 1990: 429). The question of an appropriate
name for the other language appearing in the dissertation is difficult. The traditional name in the
anthropological and linguistic literature, Nootka, is not of native origin and disliked by the
community. In 1978, the Southern Wakashan people of Canada adopted the name Nuu-chah-nulth
(mTC@MtK ‘mountain range’) (Arima & Dewhirst 1990: 410). However, as an ethnonym, this
name actually subsumes peoples speaking two languages, those speaking the language formerly
referred to as Nootka and those speaking the closely related Nitinaht or Ditidaht. I follow Nakayama (1997a, see especially p. 2) in using Nuuchahnulth in a restricted sense as a linguistic designation to refer only to the language formerly known as Nootka. Note that I simplify the spelling
by eliminating the hyphens. Ditidaht is referred to as such.
2
Makah has not been used as a medium of daily communication for decades, and, at the time of
writing, there were only three fluent speakers, all elderly.
3
Interestingly, in phoneme charts given in his M.A. and Ph.D. dissertations (1931: 10, 1933: 4),
Swadesh did group /F/ and /Y/ with the glottalized consonants. The latter work agrees with Nootka
Texts in grouping the affricates with the stops, but the former has them listed separately.
4
Sapir and Swadesh refer to them as “voiced continuants”; Rose and Nakayama call them “resonants”.",[365]
"7.3 Pre-modal clitics
7.3.1Diminutive(Makah) <?hC <?hRC, (Nuuchahnulth) <Fhr, <Fhb before glottalizing clitics (DIM): The very
common diminutive clitic indicates that some aspect or participant of a situation is small. The
most typical circumstance for the diminutive is when a participant is small in physical stature. It
may occur in the main predicate of which the participant in question is an argument, as in (447)ac and (448)a-b, or in an RP, as in (447)d and (448)c. Further research is necessary to determine
criteria for choosing between these options.",[316]
"333The same questions arise when associative kin terms function as main predicate heads. (506)a
is relatively unproblematic, but, in (506)b, it is unclear whether rHwTKlHj ‘Soreface-Hunter’ is

form <K, metathesis takes place whereby the /j/ of the habitual and the /K/ of the plural metathesize: <`9j<K surfaces as <`9Kj (cf. Jacobsen 1973: 16).
7.4.3Responsive (Makah)<Rh9 (RESP): This clitic indicates that the utterance is made in response to an utterance of the
hearer, generally a question, as demonstrated by the following standard greeting formula:
(481) Speaker 1: FtWTF`Q@j
FtWÊT<""`Q<(p)`9j
so.and.so–APPEN=TEMP=POLAR‘Hello! –– (lit.) is it you (sg.)?’

FtWÊT<""`Q<rh<Rh9
so.and.so–APPEN=INDIC.1sg=RESP‘Hello! –– (lit.) indeed, it’s me’
Second person plural clitics show longer forms with this clitic similar to those that occur with
the habitual: the second plural Set 1 form (see Table 15) becomes <?hbn9v`, and the Set 2 form
becomes <rn9v`.
When the responsive follows the habitual (§7.4.2), the final consonant of the habitual and the
initial consonant of the responsive metathesize: <`9j<Rh9 becomes <`9Rjh9. This metathesis
also occurs when the habitual has already undergone metathesis with the third plural clitic. Thus,
an underlying sequence of <`9j<K<Rh9 surfaces as <`9KRjh9 (cf. Jacobsen 1973: 18).
Jacobsen (1973: 17) reports that the responsive occurs with the Indicative and the Quotative.
Its failure to occur with most of the other moods can be explained pragmatically, e.g. it would be
a contradiction of its function to combine it with either of the interrogatives.","[334, 335]"
"232Although the graduative typically expresses an imperfective process, it sometimes seems neutral with respect to viewpoint and merely indicates that the process in question is taking place
slowly or gradually. This is probably its original function, in fact. The viewpoint component of
the aspect system as a whole seems to be an addition to, or modification of, an earlier, purely Aktionsart-based system. One apparent clue is a group of roots that do not have a simple perfective,
but only occur with the graduative. Most denote situations that cannot come about instantaneously, e.g. M aTKRhQ, N lTKRhQ ‘high tide’, N sToRhQ ‘evening’.
6.5.2DurativeThe durative aspect suffix M, N ,`ji ,tj (,F`ji ,Ftj after vowels) only occurs with bound
roots (§5.2.1) and a handful of suffixes. The distribution of the allomorphs is unpredictable, but
each root or suffix may only occur with one of the two. The durative has two basic uses:
a) It expresses an intransitive imperfective state:

+ glottal stop clusters.
23
Like glottalization (§3.3.2), lenition (referred to as “softening” by Wakashanists) is a well described process, and the two are often treated together. Many of same sources are relevant: Sapir
(1924: 92, note 84; 1938), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238), Swadesh (1933: 5-6), Rose (1976,
1981: 18), Nakayama (1997a: 19-20). On lenition in Ditidaht, see Swadesh & Swadesh (1933:
199), and, for Makah, see Jacobsen (1996) and §3.4.2.
24
Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238) cite QtX`r ‘good on the ground’, but this form is not attested in
the corpus. QtKF`r is found at NA 15.18.

Final /a/ is present underlyingly, but does not appear in the surface form due to a rule of final

32
This, incidentally, raises the question of the historical source of modern Southern Wakashan
non-labialized velars, which, with the exception of /w/, are by no means rare in the present day
languages. That is, if PW velars became alveo-palatals, whence the velar in morphemes like the
N, M root j`, ‘stick-like object protruding’?
33
TRANS = transitivizing suffix used with stative or intransitive verbs (Boas 1947: 241, #6); NOM
= nominal suffix (Boas 1947: 323). Thanks to Emmon Bach for checking my Kwakwala forms.
He drew my attention to the fact that Boas (1947: 353) erroneously writes the ‘lick’ root in (120)c
with a plain voiceless velar stop. I have substituted the correct glottalized form per Lincoln and
Rath (1980: 244).
34
See Haas (1969: 111-112, 115-120) for discussion and examples of similar correspondences
between Nuuchahnulth and Ditidaht.
35
This word, like many others with original */Wi/, now contains morphophonemic /Gi/ (§3.3.2).
36
Makah voiceless stops undergo the allophonic process of coda aspiration described for Nuuchahnulth in §2.1.
37
This example and the next are found on page 16 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in
Jacobsen’s possession.
38
Jacobsen (1996) indicates these segments with a capital barred-l.
39
Jacobsen (p.c.) has recorded this suffix as ,#` and ,#h. The ,#t form appears in my data.
40
This example is found on page 9 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in Jacobsen’s possession.
41
See §2.5 for accent.
42
Some speakers change /@/ preceding /v/ to /N/ so they would have [c`9Kn9w].
43
Interestingly, Ditidaht shows similar patterns of syncope except that, in Ditidaht, it is the second of the two vowels that deletes rather than the first. See Swadesh & Swadesh (1933).
44
This first-syllable shortening sometimes seems to apply also in words that have undergone epenthesis (§3.4.3).
45
More fully translated in Makah as ‘good, rich tasting, full of fat (said of shellfish)’.
46
Actually, the question of whether Makah, Nuuchahnulth, and other languages with lexical verbalizing suffixes can be characterized as incorporating is controversial. I am agreeing with the352view expressed by Sapir (1911b) and Mithun (1984), among others, that these languages are not
incorporating. See Jacobsen (1993: 266-67, note 2) for discussion.
47
Swadesh himself (1933: 11, note 1) compares them to the Latin enclitic conjunction -que.
48
At least one of these, x@K ‘yonder’, is attested in Makah as well.
49
See §4.4.1 for brief comments on grammatical relations. The relevant aspect of this topic here
is that a subject category can be justified for Southern Wakashan.
50
Cf. Swadesh (1933: 101-02).
51
This characteristic of Nuuchahnulth and Southern Wakashan languages contrasts sharply with
the situation in Salish languages, which are generally quite careful about indicating transitivity.
52
However, equational clauses involving personal names, place names, and RPs that contain the
article do require a copular element. See below for discussion.
53
See Chapter 8, note 114 for discussion of classification of property words.
54
Jacobsen (1979a: 114) tentatively reports a possible restriction in Makah against occurrence of
the future tense clitic with nouns. However, I was able to elicit several examples of nouns with
this clitic with no difficulty.
55
A few exceptions to this generalization have turned up in Nuuchahnulth, but syntactic predicates expressing names all seem to have existential readings, e.g. there at the door is Codfishalways-getting it (the name of a family crest), rather than equational readings.
56
See §8.2.3 for the forms of independent pronouns.
57
Cf. Sapir (1924: 86, note 31)
58
This claim does not apply to proper names, which, as discussed in §4.4.3.2, cannot function as
(syntactic) predicate heads.
59
Swadesh (1939: 82) proposes the same analysis, labeling the Nuuchahnulth article a “subject
relative” in a list of modal formatives and glossing it ‘he who is, does’.
60
However, the proper analysis of Makah RPs with possessive clitics, which have essentially the
same syntactic distribution as the article, (e.g. E`o`b<rhr ‘my canoe’) is as yet unclear.
61
Some have suggested that referring expressions in Salish languages are also nominalized predicates or clauses. See, for example, van Eijk (1997) on Lillooet and Thompson, Thompson, &
Egesdal (1996) on Thompson. Similar claims have been made for other languages of the Americas. See Comrie & Thompson (1985: 391-95) for a brief review.
62
Relative roots do have the special property of remaining the grammatical head of the word
when affixed by nuclear lexical suffixes, which otherwise become head themselves. See §5.1.
63
These might be considered a kind of equational clause (§4.4.3.2).
64
Often it is also possible to express manner of action and relation in a single derived verb, with
the manner expressed by the base and the relation by a suffix, e.g. M J`b,hx@, N J`b,H pinchgive.PERF ‘pinch sth off and give it to’, M C`p,hx@, N C`p,`xH push-give.PERF ‘push sth to sb’,
M Bhbj,hx@ throw-give.PERF ‘throw sth to sb’, N b`r,Hbr chase-bringing.along ‘chase sth
along’. For an example of the first word, see (201)b.
65
With some hesitation he terms this construction “serialization”, a characterization I find misleading because of the many differences between the Southern Wakashan construction and constructions called “serial verb” constructions in other languages, e.g. 1) any number of predicates
can be so combined (although more than two or three is uncommon), 2) the set of predicates from
which bare absolute predicates can be drawn is open-ended, 3) any lexical item can fill the role of
main predicate or of the bare absolute.
66

event or state), i.e. a predication” (Nakayama 1997a: 115).","[366, 367, 368]"

note 31 and stwiRhQ at p. 88, note 45. Klokeid (1977) notes similar variation in unpublished
manuscripts.
While it is generally true that Sapir & Swadesh (1939, 1955) do not record the actual phonetic variation in labialization, even in these texts it can be found in few places. Consider the examples in (34): addition of the Subordinate mood clitic <p@ (§7.2.7) to G`xt ‘ten’, a base ending in a rounded vowel, produces a form transcribed variously as G`xtp` or G`xtpi`. As previously mentioned, clitic boundaries are treated like word boundaries for purposes of labialization,
so such variation is expected:
(34)G`xtp` or
G`xt<p@G`xtpi`ten=SUBOR‘that there were ten’ (first form at NA 344.20, second at NA 62.33-34)
3.2.3Reduction of vowel sequencesVowel sequences are not permitted. When two vowels come to be adjacent in the course of derivation, the sequence is reduced to a single vowel whose length and quality are determined by the
length and quality of the underlying vowels (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 236-37). The rules for reduction of vowel sequences that involve the first root vowel (i.e. the vowel following the initial37consonant of the root) differ slightly from those for sequences that do not involve the first root
vowel. This involves a bit of morphological conditioning (because the rules need to “know”
whether a vowel is the first vowel of a root –– a morphological rather than phonological question), so reduction of vowel sequences is not a purely phonologically-conditioned process like the
other processes in this section, but it is regular, unlike the morpheme-specific processes described
in §3.3.
3.2.3.1Sequences not involving the first root vowela) The quality of the resultant vowel is determined by the hierarchy t > h > `. The quality will
be /t/ if one of the two underlying vowels is /t/, /h/ if an /h/ but no /t/ is involved, and /`/
only if both underlying vowels are /`/. The order of the underlying vowels is immaterial. Examples are wanting for h*t and `*t sequences due to the scarcity of /t/-initial suffixes.

As a rule, however, simple RPs are less complex than main clauses; referring expressions requiring overt subject and/or object RPs are often expressed by apposed simple RPs (231), or else by a

The bracketing in (231)a represents one possible analysis of the structure of such examples. Other
analyses are conceivable.
If the RP does not contain a nominal word (i.e. a noun, property word?, or quantifier/numeral), use of the article is obligatory. If a nominal word is present, the article is optional;141in this case, its presence or absence can have functional significance. Its function overlaps the
English definite article, but, rather than indicating definiteness (i.e. identifiability or uniqueness),
the Southern Wakashan article appears to indicate something closer to specificity, e.g. pTF`rFh
in (231)a is more accurately translated ‘the, a certain one that is a man’. The function of the article is considered in more detail in §7.2.21.
The spirit, if not the letter, of the present analysis of RP structure is anticipated by Sapir
(1911a, 1924). The parallelism is somewhat obscured by the fact that, like other writers of the
time (cf. Andrade 1933 on Quileute, and Boas 1947 on Kwakwala), Sapir uses the terms “nominal” and “verbal” in reference to kinds of linguistic categories that are today considered distinct;
he uses these terms to refer to both lexeme categories (noun and verb) and logico-syntactic categories (referring expression or noun phrase and predicate). (We leave open here the question of
whether Sapir himself recognized such distinctions conceptually.) Making allowance for such
terminological conflation, we see the germ of the RPs-as-clauses analysis already in this early
statement (Sapir 1911a: 17): “In both [Nuuchahnulth and Kwakwala] the stem is, as far as its
meaning allows, indifferently verbal [i.e. able to function as predicate––MD] or nominal [i.e. able
to function as a referring expression] and one or more suffixes [clitics] are required to give rise to
definitely verbal [predicative] or nominal [referring] complexes; in [Nuuchahnulth] a suffixed
[<FH] is often used to substantivize [i.e. make referring] a verb [i.e. predicative] form.” Likewise, in Sapir (1924: 84, note 9), he says the article is “often used as [a] nominalizing element”.
A more straightforward antecedent is found in Jacobsen (1979a, 1993), who refers to
“nominalization by the Article of core clauses” (Jacobsen 1993: 256). On the same page he also
claims “[The Nuuchahnulth phrase] KTbrldFh “the woman” ... is formed from KTbrl`
“woman” as a nominalized predicate “the one who is a woman”, with the identifying value that
would be conferred by an English relative clause.” Referring to Makah, he (1979a: 122) says: “...
[F]orms with ,?hp contain undercover predications, so that, for instance, PhcHkhp is literally, or at
least etymologically, ‘(the) one that is a dog’.” This is close to the present analysis, except I142ogically, ‘(the) one that is a dog’.” This is close to the present analysis, except I would omit the
etymological qualification. I claim Southern Wakashan RPs contain predications synchronically,
and, moreover, that all RPs (except proper names), even those without the article, are clauses; the
article is simply an overt marker of the subordinate syntactic status of RPs as referring expressions.60, 61
An alternative line of analysis takes RP structure to be much like that of an English NP, that
is, a phrase consisting of a noun head and optional modifiers (Rose 1981: 39-45, Stonham 1999).
I will forego detailed discussion or critique of “standard NP” analyses except to comment that
they suffer from two main faults: 1) they fail to account for the clause-RP symmetries we have
seen, and 2) they assume the noun is the head of the phrase, but I see no language-internal structural evidence that justifies this assumption (e.g. a noun need not be present, the distribution of
the phrase as a whole is not equivalent to the distribution of the noun, etc.).
4.5.2Root RPsSimple RPs are the most common way of referring to entities. Another option, however, is to use
a “root” RP, i.e. an RP containing a relative root. These RPs are also headless relative clauses,
and are structurally similar to questions (§7.2.15-7.2.16). In this construction, a relative pronoun
root such as M x`p@, N x`pi ‘one who, that which’ or M pih, N pihp ‘whoever, whatever’ is
predicate head with a relative mood clitic and appropriate pronominal clitic attached. Other predicative clitics (e.g. passive-inverse, temporal specifier, tense) appear according to their normal
grammatical behavior. Predicates in the phrase other than the initial relative nominal predicate are
bare absolutes.

If the entity referred to is not equivalent to the subject of the phrase-internal predication, the relative root must in fact have affixed a verbalizing lexical suffix. The default suffix for this purpose
in Makah is ,(j)sh9o ‘doing to, with reference to ...’ and in Nuuchahnulth is -(C)hK [L] id., if a suffix with more specific meaning is not available. Compare the meanings of the root RPs in (234)

Root RPs can function as stand-alone referring expressions, as we have seen in all the examples so far in this section, but they are often set in apposition to simple RPs to form more complex
referring structures. They generally follow apposed simple RPs, but sometimes precede them

Words from most of the classes listed in §4.1 may function as predicate head. (See §4.4.3 for a

4.3.1Mood and pronominal markingSouthern Wakashan predicates may be mood-marked or “absolute,” i.e. not marked for mood. In
Makah, the first word in a mood-marked predicate hosts a clitic indicating mood. Indicative100mood, the default mood for conversation, is marked by its own set of pronominal clitics. (For the
moment we restrict our attention to predicates containing no predicate modifiers.)

Other moods are generally expressed by a mood clitic followed by a separate pronominal clitic.
The Polar (‘yes/no’) Interrogative mood shown in (165), for example, is marked by the Polar Interrogative clitic <(p)@j plus a set of pronominal clitics in which the first person singular subject form is <r:

In non-Indicative moods, pronominal markers involving first and second persons are transparently structurally distinct from the mood clitics. For third person forms, although a more abstract
analysis is theoretically possible in which the mood markers and pronominal formatives are
sometimes distinct, formal complexities arise that make it more analytically convenient to assume
fused mood-pronominal forms (§7.2.1).

"134Existentials in which the location is expressed by a following verb –– e.g. (218)a,c-d –– are in
essence multi-clausal reversals of a mono-clausal construction having the locational verb as the
sole predicate head and the nominal expression as its subject. (218)c-d, for instance, could be expressed equally well with such a mono-clausal sentence:

Nominal predicates containing restrictive path-orientation or locative suffixes are a special
case. They are often atransitive existentials (in (218)b,e-g, for example). In some cases, however,
they are intransitive with personal subject reference. In this use, the subject referent is asserted to
have some relation with the referent of the nominal base that can be loosely referred to as possession.57 Schematically: ‘X [subject referent] has Y [referent of nominal base] at Z [location denoted by suffix(es)]’. I call this the possessive-existential (or bahuvrihi) reading. Consider the
examples in (220).

It is often unclear whether a third person referent in a sentence with a restricted nominal predicate
(i.e. a predicate containing a predicate head with a restrictive locative suffix) is to be interpreted
as the subject of the predicate (triggering a possessive-existential reading) or as a locative adjunct
expanding the reference of the restrictive suffix(es) (triggering a simple existential reading). This
ambiguity exists in (220)c, for example. The source translates the sentence assuming the first
reading, as if M@r`otKFh ‘a day screen (a board with a painting depicting a mythological subject
on it)’ were the subject of the nominal predicate ptF`bF`BtK F`Q`F`BtK ‘(be) two people on a
surface’, but it is just as likely to be a locative RP expanding the reference of ,-F@Bt(K), that is,
an adjunct further specifying the identity of the surface the two people are on. The alternative
readings are ‘a day screen has two people on it’ and ‘there are two people on a day screen’. Another ambiguous Nuuchahnulth example is shown in (221). This sentence is especially interesting
because it contains two restricted nominal predicates. The first is the main complex predicate
head b`pHbs`phlKBt l@sl@r ‘twenty tribes in a container’; the second is the relative clause
x`Y`pQMtj ‘that which is in the hand’, which is adjoined to the demonstrative F`G ‘this’

The relative clause is clearly possessive-existential: the first person pronominal clitic assures us
of that. The question is whether F`G x`Y`pQMtjp`r ‘this that I have in my hand’ is the subject
of the main predicate (translation a) or an adjunct RP expanding the reference of the locative suffix ,BT ‘in a container’ (translation b).","[149, 150, 151, 152]"

Addition of another nuclear suffix creates a new level of structure. Any number of nuclear suffixes may be so added, each creating a new word which may then serve as base for further derivation. This is essentially a restatement of Swadesh’s (1939: 85) generalization that “[when] a series
of [nuclear] suffixes are added to a [base], each successive suffix makes a new [word] which
serves as the underlying [base] for the next suffix.” The following rewrite rule captures this generalization:
(259)Wordα → Base + Nucα164(259) states that a word of category alpha (i.e. noun, verb, etc.) consists of a base of any category
plus a nuclear suffix of category alpha (i.e. nominalizing, verbalizing, etc.). This rule is recursive;
successive applications of it can add any number of nuclear suffixes, although more than three is
rare in a given word. Multiple suffixes of the same category can be added in succession, or, as
more frequently occurs, the category can change with each suffix.
The phrases and sentences in (260) and (261) each contain derived words with multiple nuclear suffixes. The word in question is repeated below the example’s translation with labeled
bracketing to show its constituent structure; buffer consonants (§5.2.2) and indications of CV
template associations are omitted from the bracketed representations to faciliate readability.

The Nuuchahnulth verbalizing suffix -(b)rl`Y`p` in (261)a actually consists of the verbalizing
suffix ,(b)rl` ‘defending ...’ plus the restrictive plural suffix ,Y`p` (§5.5.4), but the combination may be treated as a single nuclear suffix for our purposes, since it is now more or less lexicalized to mean ‘fighting over, competing in...’ (as in bhp,rl`Y`p` ‘competing in oratory’,
g`V`,brl`Y`p` ‘fighting to eat’, etc.).","[178, 179, 180]"

Example (168) contains the possessive clitic <F`ji, which here indicates that the grammatical
subject is the possessor of the single argument of the intransitive predicate head (S) cTvhprt
‘father’; the possessed S argument is syntactically an oblique. The first person possessor in (168)
is hence the subject and the second person participant, the S of cTvhprt ‘(be) father’, is oblique.
Significantly, the same Indicative pronominal clitic is used as in the preceding first person singular acting on second person singular transitive example (167).

Eschewing the details, arguments can be given to show that (168) is, in fact, intransitive; that is,
we are not dealing with a transitive construction like ‘you (are) father (to) me’.
In Nuuchahnulth, the first word in a mood-marked predicate hosts a mood clitic followed directly by a pronominal clitic that expresses the person and number of the subject:
(169)NUUCHAHNULTHmtmTJi`Q`G
mtmTj<""`Q<(l)@<`G
sing=TEMP=INDIC=1sg‘I am singing.’
Third person, however, is unmarked by a pronominal clitic –– the absence of a pronominal clitic
indicates third person. In some cases the mood clitic shows slight formal peculiarities when not
followed by a first or second person clitic that could be said to mark third person, but third person
has no clitic of its own:102(170)NUUCHAHNULTHmtmTJi`Ql`
mtmTj<""`Q<l@
sing=TEMP=INDIC‘He/she/it/they are singing.’
The Nuuchahnulth pronominal subject clitics fall into several sets of forms depending on the preceding mood clitic (§7.2.2), e.g. the Indicative mood clitic in (169) and (170) <(l)@ (or <l@
with no following pronominal clitic) is followed by a set in which first person singular is indicated by <`G.
Unlike Makah, Nuuchahnulth does not mark non-subjects in the clitic sequence under most
circumstances. However, first person non-subjects are marked in imperative moods (§7.2.20),
and, very rarely, in the Indicative (§7.2.4).
Southern Wakashan mood clitics express a varied set of modal, evidential, and speech-act
categories. Most of these are in paradigmatic opposition, but a few may co-occur to form mood
combinations (§7.2.3). Mood clitics include the Indicative illustrated above for both languages,
the Purposive M, N <""`9 ‘in order that’, interrogative moods used to form both yes/no and content questions, the Conditional M <pdx(t), N <pt9 ‘if, when; would’, the Nuuchahnulth Dubitative <p@E` ‘perhaps’, and the Subordinate M <W, <p`9, N <p@, which forms that-clause
complements of predicates of saying, thinking, etc. as well as causal (‘because’) clauses, and, in
Makah, ‘when’ clauses (in conjunction with Ftxt ‘when’). There are also several evidential
moods in both languages, including the Quotative M <v`9s, <v`9c`, N <vDFhm and inferential moods. The Makah Relative <(p)hj, <(p)h and Nuuchahnulth Definite Relative <FHsp and
Indefinite Relative <(x)h9 moods form relative clauses. See Chapter 7 for more on the form and
function of these and other mood clitics.
Predicates without mood marking are often called “absolute” or “absolutive” in the Southern
Wakashan descriptive literature (e.g. Sapir 1924: 82, note 1, Rose 1981: 213, Jacobsen 1979a,
1993). It is necessary to recognize two types of absolute predicates: subject-marked absolutes and103non-subject-marked absolutes, which I henceforth refer to as “bare absolutes”. Bare absolutes
occur only as same-subject juxtaposed predicates in the common sentence-building construction
described in §4.5, or as complements of certain complement-taking words (§4.6.2.1). Subjectmarked absolutes typically occur in narrative contexts where the mood has been previously established in the discourse by a preceding mood-marked predicate.
Pronominal subjects in subject-marked absolute predicates are marked on the first word of the
predicate by a set of pronominal clitics, which, in Makah, has no form indicating third person
singular, and, in Nuuchahnulth, has no form indicating third person whatsoever. Bare absolute
predicates (by definition) have no subject marking. This means that a third person subject-marked
absolute is overtly indistinguishable from a bare absolute. For example, in the Makah sentences in
(171), compare the third person singular subject-marked absolute in (171)a with the two predicates in (171)b, the first of which is the third person singular subject-marked absolute matrix
predicate vhJ`Q ‘He/she/it did, were not’, and the second, g`FtjRhQ ‘eat’, a bare absolute functioning as complement to vhJ`Q.

The three predicates are superficially identical with respect to subject marking. However, it is
easy enough to tell them apart as long as we keep in mind the structural difference between a zero
form and nothing, that is, a form where a decision between paradigmatic options has resulted in a
marker that happens to be zero versus a form in which no marking can ever occur. This distinction clearly emerges when the sentences are put in first person:104(172)MAKAHa. g`FtjRF`Qrh

not=TEMP=1sg[eat–PERF]‘I didn’t eat.’
(172) c. )vhJ`Qrh [g`FtjRhQrH]
The subject-marked absolute predicates in (172)a-b are now marked with the first person singular
clitic <rh9. The bare absolute complement to vhJ`Qrh in (172)b remains without the subject clitic, and, as (172)c shows, the sentence becomes ungrammatical (with this meaning) if it is added.
(172)c is a grammatical string, but only if it is interpreted as two successive subject-marked absolutes (‘I didn’t do it; I ate’), where the speaker asserts that he did eat, but didn’t do something
else. In this dissertation, predicates in constructed sentence examples are usually marked with
Indicative mood (the unmarked mood for conversation), but examples cited from texts are frequently subject-marked absolutes. See, for example, (176)e-f, (178)b, (179)c etc. below. Presented with a subject-marked absolute out of context, Makah speakers typically “correct” it to a
mood-marked predicate.
4.3.2TenseSentences with no overt tense marking are, strictly speaking, non-future, that is, they are interpreted as having either past or present time reference, according to context. Non-tense-marked
predicates in isolated elicitation sentences are invariably interpreted as having present time reference in Makah (unless they are perfective –– see below), and I suspect in Nuuchahnulth also. In
both languages, however, one frequently finds non-tense-marked predicates with past time reference in narrative discourse. Past and future tense clitics in the predicate indicate time reference105relative to that already established in the discourse. For example, the past tense clitic M <(a)hs,
N <(l)hs is a relative past marker in that it indicates time reference prior to the discourseestablished time reference rather than absolute past time reference.
(173)NUUCHAHNULTHmtmTJi`Qhsrh
mtmTj<""`Q<(l)hs<rH
sing=TEMP=PAST=1sg‘I was, had been singing.’
It is worth pointing out here that tense and aspect are entirely distinct formal systems in Southern
Wakashan. Tense is marked by clitics, while aspect is marked by suffixes, reduplication, or length
changes in base vowels (§4.2.3). However, past temporal reference is strongly implied by perfective aspect, which is usually incompatible with present reference (§6.4). See, for example, the
past tense translations of the sentences in (171) and (172).
The temporal specifier M, N <""`Q is another predicate clitic implicated in temporal reckoning. It precedes tense, mood and pronominal clitics in the clitic sequence. The temporal specifier
is not a tense marker, but is used to indicate temporal sequencing of events and states. It is usually
left untranslated, but can be rendered ‘now, then, at that time’ if necessary. The temporal specifier
is grammatically optional, but is stylistically important and very frequent in discourse. See §7.3.3
for further information.
4.3.3Other cliticsThus far we have seen clitics expressing mood, pronominals, and tense. These belong to a larger
set of clitics that may occur in the predicate. When more than one occurs on the same word in the
predicate, they are strictly ordered. Although the order differs somewhat for the two languages,
clitics in both may be divided into three groups based on their sequencing requirements: premodal clitics, mood and pronominal clitics, and post-modal clitics. Pre-modal clitics precede
mood clitics. Among them we find the following (only a single allomorph of each is shown):106(174)Selected pre-modal cliticsIntentive Future: N <F`9pQ (§7.3.2)
Causative: M, N <""`o
Temporal Specifier (‘now, then, at that time’): M, N <""`Q (§7.3.3)
Passive-inverse: M <""hs, N <""`s (§4.4.2, §7.3.5)
Possessive: M, N <tj (§7.3.4)
Tense: including past M<(a)hs, N <(l)hs and hypothetical future M <""dxhj, N <""h9j
Co-occurrence restrictions and relative ordering of these clitics are discussed at §7.5. Some of
the clitics in (174) are briefly discussed elsewhere in this chapter, e.g. see §4.4.2 for the passiveinverse.
Post-modal clitics follow mood and pronominal clitics.

Habitual: M <`9j, N <F`9K` (§7.4.2)
‘again’: M <QFn, N <Q`9 (§7.4.4)
4.3.4Predicate modifiersThe basic predicate structure of head and clitics in the examples seen so far in this section may be
expanded by the addition of one or two predicate modifiers. Predicate modifiers are a small
closed-class of words like N F`GF@ ‘then’, M F@ch, N F@mh ‘really, in fact’, M xTxT, N C@mh
‘at first, for a while, temporarily’, N FHpGH ‘still’, M gTF`Wh ‘still, yet’, M jTvhK, N jtVhK`
‘doing as directed’, N v@Q ‘now, then, thereupon’, and M xTpi@, N XTpi@ ‘likewise’. A few
words from other word classes can also play this syntactic role, e.g. M FhFHWi`, N FHGi ‘big’
also occurs as as a predicate modifier meaning ‘really, very much, to a great extent’.","[116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122]"
"2907.2.18 Dubitative (Nuuchahnulth)
This mood (not to be confused with the dubitative formative <(v)t9r, §7.2.3) acknowledges the
possibility of a non-future event or situation. Speculation about future events is made by
<(v)t9r.

7.2.19 Assertive
The Assertive is essentially a conversational mood, which accounts for its infrequency in the
Nuuchahnulth texts. Rose’s (1981: 224, 225) description of this mood in Kyuquot dialect (where
it is called the “indicative”, see below) applies to its use in Tseshaht as well:291The indicative mood is used for statements of fact validated by experience, observation, general cultural knowledge, or wise authority ... It is also used to indicate that the act of assertion is as communicatively as important as its content.
This can be because the sentence is an important announcement [or] a statement
contrary to the listener’s opinion ...
The Assertive occurs most commonly in the texts precisely where this description would lead us
to predict, in contexts like that of Text 44, in which Tom gives his grandson (Alex Thomas) advice about life:

Rose (1981) and Nakayama (1997a) refer to this mood in Kyuquot and Ahousaht dialects as
the “indicative” mood. Dialects north of Barkley Sound (which include Kyuquot and Ahousaht)
do not have the <(l)@ Indicative mood described for Tseshaht in §7.2.4. The <FHR formative
in these dialects has apparently been named “indicative” because both it and the Tseshaht Indicative are found predominately in conversation, but this analogy is misleading because, as both
Rose (1981: 224) and Nakayama (1997a: 31) point out, <FHR is highly marked pragmatically292even in these dialects and so is not strictly comparable to the Tseshaht Indicative, which is unmarked.
The Assertive occurs in Makah as well. It is not fully attested, but seems to involve <hR
added to Indicative endings, thus first person singular <rhR, first person plural <chR, third person singular, <?hR, etc. Its semantic force seems to involve emphatic assertion:

As in Nuuchahnulth, it occurs in Makah (after the Indicative) with the contrastive particle F`st,
e.g. F`sFtbhR ‘but you (sg.) ...’ (Jacobsen 1973: 18).
7.2.20 Imperative moods
Makah has two Imperative moods. The simple Imperative is shown in Table 20. (For morphological analysis of the forms see Jacobsen 1973: 19-20.)

a`jiÊ""@F`9o<""hC<jd9
buy–buy=IMPER.2pl=ADVISE‘You folks buy it!’
The clitic <jd9 in (432)b follows imperative forms to lessen the force of a command to advice or
polite suggestion.
First person hortatives are formed by preceding the second person acting on first person plural imperative clitics with the causative clitic <""`o. For comparison, non-hortative imperatives
with first plural object are shown in (433). Example (433)a shows a regular (non-hortative) second person singular acting on first person plural imperative; (433)b shows second person plural
acting on first person plural:
(433)MAKAHa. C`pRF`IhcHbtW

C`pÊRhQ<""`Q<""hcn9v`btW
push–PERF=TEMP=IMPER.2pl/1pl‘Push us! (said to more than one person)’
Example (434) shows the above with the causative clitic, which takes the shape <""to after the
temporal specifier. These are now first person hortatives:
(434)MAKAHa. C`pRF`IFtcHbtW
C`pÊRhQ<""`Q<""to<""hch9btW

C`pÊRhQ<""`Q<""`o<""hcn9v`btW
push–PERF=TEMP=CAUS=IMPER.2pl/1pl‘Let’s push it! (said to more than one person)’
The phonological alternations producing these forms are regular but perhaps deserve spelling out.
The clitic sequence underlying (434)a is <""`Q<""to<""hch9btW. Glottalization rules produce294<""`ItFhcHbtW, where the temporal specifier has been glottalized, and the causative /o/ is
dropped before the glottalizing imperative. Next, the resulting /tFh/ sequence is dealt with by assimilating the second vowel to the first, which is then syncopated to produce the surface form:
<""`IFtcHbtW.
The second Makah imperative mood is a “directional” imperative (‘go and ...!’), formed by
<Ch preceding the Simple Imperative clitics:

There are four Imperative moods in Nuuchahnulth. Table 21 shows two, the Present Imperative and Future Imperative paradigms (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 242). First person singular and
plural objects have distinct forms. The columns marked “3 obj” are really just intransitive forms
that also serve to mark third person objects.

Nuuchahnulth also has directional imperatives that mean ‘come and ...!’ or ‘go and ...!’.

Finally, a structural note. As we have seen, the pronominal marking in the clitic sequence
usually expresses the person and number (in first and second person) of the subject. In Imperative
moods, however, first person objects are indexed with a pronominal clitic. In bare absolute complement constructions the mood and pronominal clitics occur on the matrix predicate (§4.6.2.1).
This means the first person object of a transitive bare absolute complement predicate is actually
marked on the matrix predicate instead of the complement in an Imperative mood.

7.2.21 The articles
The article M <?hp, N <FH (and its evidential-quotative counterpart N <(l)hE` ~ <E@) normally attaches to the first non-demonstrative word of the RP.105 It has multiple functions. The
most basic is simply to mark referring phrases as such. It occurs optionally with RPs containing a
noun or quantifier, but obligatorily with RPs that do not contain a word from one of these classes.
In cases where it is optional, its appearance seems to be conditioned by some functional parameter akin to definiteness. Sapir (1924: 84, note 9) calls <FH a “suffixed definite article, often used
as nominalizing element”, Swadesh (1948: 109) calls it a “definite suffix”, and Rose (1981: 250-29853) describes it as a definite and particularizing marker. Jacobsen (1973: 21) says the Makah article “indicates a certain definiteness of reference”. It is true that RPs whose referents are definite
(in the sense of identifiable) and particular (specific and referential) almost always have an article, sometimes in concert with the preceding demonstrative particle, x@ in Nuuchahnulth106 or sH
‘this’, WT ‘that’ and related forms in Makah.107 For example, the referents of N pTF`rFh ‘the
man’ in (443)a and N x@ pTF`rFh ‘the man’ in (443)b are introduced in preceding sentences of
their respective texts (Text 13 and Text 76) and are thus identifiable and particular.

However, definiteness and particularity cannot be the whole story, as shown by the two RPs in
example (444), which is the first sentence of Text 16.

FtÊm@ji<vDFhmG@ji@Q pTF`rFh
G@ji@Q pTF`r<FHso.and.so–have=QUOTgirlperson=ART‘A certain man had a daughter.’ (NT 68.22)
This sentence introduces the referents of both RPs into the text for the first time, which means
they ostensibly have the same identifiability status (unidentifiable), and both are particular, yet
the subject RP has an article and the object RP does not.
In general, RPs that depart from the narrow identifiable-and-particular type in (443) (e.g. RPs
with unidentifiable referents, non-referential expressions, generic RPs, etc.), show complex patterns of article use that are not well understood and that may not be reducible to a single general
principle. Consider the RPs in (445). These sentences come from a passage in which the speaker299is describing his attempt to build a big house, a project which first requires finding appropriately
large cedar logs. Sentence (445)a occurs two paragraphs before (445)b.

... when=DEF=1sgso.and.so–obtain=TEMPQtK
QtKGtlHr
GtlHrgoodcedar‘... when I found good cedars.’ (NT 140.19)
The pattern of the article use in these sentences is further evidence against the definiteness-andparticularity hypothesis in its simplest form. Neither of the referents is identifiable, and the object
RP in (445)a, QtjiHsFh GtlHr ‘stout cedar logs’, which has the article, is non-referential –– the
speaker is looking for any objects that satisfy the intension of the RP rather than some specific
subset of stout cedar logs. In fact, that may be exactly the point: the article in (445)a may indicate
that the speaker is looking for “the whole set” in the sense that any member of the set of cedar
logs that are stout will do, while the lack of article in (445)b indicates he did not find the entire
set of good cedars, just some non-specific subset.
It is probably the case that the article is sensitive to discourse-pragmatic factors like topicality
and communicative importance in addition to –– or instead of –– definiteness or particularity/specificity strictly defined. Other criteria, as yet undiscovered, may also be relevant. As Rose
(1981) suggests, it may be necessary to take into account other elements that are present in an RP,
and if so, their categories. Further study of how the article is used in discourse is the only sure
way of making progress on these questions.
Makah also has a series of possessive clitics, shown in Table 23, that attach to the first word
of RPs containing a noun to indicate possessor.","[312, 313, 314, 315]"

Sapir (1924), Swadesh (1933: 16-17), Swadesh (1939: 82), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 242-43),
Swadesh (1948a), and Haas (1969).100 The analysis contained herein is along the lines suggested
by Sapir (1924), although the Indicative paradigm listed by Sapir (1924: 82, note 1) does not
segment the modal formative from the pronominal endings.
Nuuchahnulth presents fewer complications than Makah with regard to mood and pronominal
marking. To begin with, in most moods Nuuchahnulth pronominal clitics index only subjects.
Second, there is less variation in the shapes of mood clitics and in the pronominal subject clitics.
Third, in the present analysis, third person is unmarked (except, occasionally, by an irregularity in
the form of the mood clitic when it is not followed by a first or second person clitic). A third person plural subject or object can optionally be marked with the third plural clitic <F`K (§7.4.1).
Nuuchahnulth subject clitics fall into four sets based on the mood clitics they occur with
(Table 17). (These four sets are not to be taken as etymologically equivalent to the four Makah
sets in Table 15, although, many of the individual formatives are undoubtedly at least partially
cognate.) Set 1 occurs with the Indicative and Purposive clitics. Set 2a occurs in absolute predicates and with the Quotative. Set 2b occurs with most of the other mood clitics: Interrogative,

The Nuuchahnulth mood clitics are listed in Table 18. Hyphens indicate a few probable
boundaries between etymologically distinct modal formatives. I have mostly retained the mood
names as given in Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 242) except their “Relative” mood has been renamed
“Definite Relative”. The Inferential I and Assertive moods, not included by them, have been
added based on my study of the texts.101 Their names are my own invention. My “Assertive”
mood corresponds to Rose (1981) and Nakayama’s (1997a) “indicative” in Kyuquot and
Ahousaht dialects. See §7.2.19. One of Sapir and Swadesh’s moods, the Relative Dubitative, has

<FHRMood combinations and other modal formativesThe mood clitics are mutually exclusive with one exception in Nuuchahnulth: the Quotative can
combine with some of the other moods. It co-occurs at least with the Conditional, the Subordinate, the Inferential II, and the Dubitative. The Conditional and Subordinate precede the Quotative, while the two evidential moods, the Inferential II and Dubitative, follow it, e.g.
COND=QUOT:<pt9vdFhm (but occasionally QUOT=COND, <vDFhmpt9)SUBOR=QUOT:<GvDFhmQUOT=DUB:<vDFhmp`E`QUOT=INFERII:<vDFhmE`Y`R267Examples of these Quotative combinations will be given below in the sections on the relevant
non-Quotative moods.
Several other modal formatives are in use in Makah and Nuuchahnulth, but these never occur
without the presence a mood clitic from Table 18.102 These additional formatives are as follows:
M <(n9)vhr, N <(v)t9r dubitative, precedes at least the M, N Indicative, N Subordinate, M
Relative, N Indefinite Relative, N Inferential II, and N Dubitative. Other combinations
may be possible. The dubitative expresses the possibility that an event might occur or
doubt as to whether it will occur.
M <oh9s evidential, occurs with the Indicative.103
N <C quotative/evidential, occurs with the Conditional, Interrogative, Indefinite Relative, and
perhaps Subordinate. It is inserted between the mood clitic and the pronominal clitic, e.g.
the second person singular quotative Indefinite Relative is <(x)h9<C<j. This formative
is probably also an etymological component of the Inferential I & II and Dubitative mood
clitics.
N <F@ follows the Interrogative to form negative biased questions: ‘Is he? (of course not)’
(Swadesh 1939: 83).
N <pn9 follows the Subordinate (rarely) and Inferential II (commonly) to express unanticipated
result: ‘as it turned out’.
See below for examples of these formatives in use.

Objects in Nuuchahnulth are not normally marked in the clitic sequence. One exception is
found with Imperative moods, which I discuss at §7.2.20. In the ceremonial language of speeches,
one also occasionally finds forms for second person singular subject acting on first person singular object that occur only with the Indicative, <(l)@<Fhb`r, transparently formed from the
regular second singular plus ,`r:

"7.2 Mood and pronominal clitics
We begin with description of the mood and pronominal clitics due to their importance in the
grammatical system. The basic principles underlying their use have been described in §4.3.1.
7.2.1Makah mood-pronominal formsJacobsen (1973) contains the first description of Makah moods and pronouns. My analysis generally agrees with his, but does differ in certain respects. Some differences are merely terminological, e.g. I have renamed his “nominal” mood the “Relative”. In other places, as he notes, alternative analyses of forms are possible given the raw data. My choice of an analytical alternative for
Makah has sometimes been influenced by study of the Nuuchahnulth material (and vice-versa).
For instance, one can analyze one particular Makah variant of the third person plural clitic as either <K or <`K (see the section “Third person subject” below). Based on the Nuuchahnulth cognate <F`K (§7.4.1), I have analyzed the form as <`K. This also brings the form into line with two
other variants of the clitic in Makah which are uncontroversially <@K and <?`K. On the other
hand, Jacobsen selects the <K option (Jacobsen 1973: 5, et passim), presumably on the sound
principle that, everything else being equal, one should only posit segments for which one has di-256rect evidence. For me, the Nuuchahnulth form and the other Makah forms tip the scales for <`K.
This allows us to straightforwardly reconstruct a third plural allomorph for Proto-Nootkan
*<(F)`K (assuming the Ditidaht data is not contradictory) without having to account for an errant
Makah reflex that lacks the vowel. Nonetheless, there is one instance in which it does seem we
must posit an <K allomorph in Makah (§7.4.2).
Combinations of first and second person
We begin our presentation of Makah pronominal clitics with forms expressing combinations of
first and second persons, shown in Table 14.
Table 14. Makah pronominals - combinations of first and second person

<rn9v`r`C
<cn9v`r`CRows represent subjects, and columns represent non-subjects. (I say “non-subject” rather than
“object” because, as mentioned in §4.3.1, obliques are sometimes indexed by these forms as well
as objects.) Further morphological segmentation is possible in the table, but I have chosen to
leave the forms unanalyzed in this dissertation for simplicity. Jacobsen (1973: 6-8) can be consulted for suggestions concerning further analytic possibilities.
The four forms at the top left of the table express first person subject with second person nonsubject. These forms occur by themselves as Indicative mood forms as well as with clitics expressing other moods, or with no mood clitic (in absolute predicates). The bottom right of the table shows the eight forms expressing second person subject with first person non-subject. The
upper form in each cell occurs by itself as the Indicative mood form. (The longer forms appear257preceding the responsive post-modal clitic <Rh9 (§7.4.3).) The lower form occurs elsewhere, i.e.
with mood clitics or in absolute predicates.
First and second person subject, intransitive or with third person non-subject
Table 15 shows pronominal clitics expressing first and second person intransitive subjects. The
same forms convey first or second person subjects with third person non-subjects. Some forms

person intransitive subjects
Set 1Set 2a1sg<r(h)<rh9pl<(h)c<ct92sg<?hbpl<?hb`9Set 2bSet 2c
<r<c<rt9<ct9
<∅<r`9have longer shapes when followed by certain post-modal clitics, especially the habitual <`9j
(§7.4.2) and the responsive <Rh9 (§7.4.3), e.g. the Set 2 second plural form is<rn9v`C when
followed by<`9j: <rNv`C@j ‘you (pl.) always ...’. Presentation of these longer variants is
mostly reserved for later sections to avoid cluttering the table with alternate forms. We can note
here, however, that the first person singular Set 1 form is <rh when followed by the habitual and
responsive, otherwise it is <r. The first person plural Set 1 form is <c unless it follows a consonant and is not in turn followed by a vowel, in which case it is <hc.
The forms are divided into four sets according to the shape they take following different
mood clitics, although no person/number combination shows four distinct variant forms: first singular and plural and second singular have three variants each; second person plural has only two.
Some individual variants for any given person/number combination are obviously shared between
sets, but the sets differ as to which particular variant they show, e.g. Set 2a and Set 2c show the
same first plural variant (<ct9), but for second singular, it is Set 2a and Set 2b that are identical
(<rt9).","[271, 272, 273]"

Two second person plural clitics take longer forms in Makah when directly followed by the
habitual clitic. I have not reelicited this material, so my description relies on Jacobsen’s (1973:
16-17) presentation of the data; he refers to this morpheme as the “usitative”. The Set 1 (Indicative) second person plural clitic in Table 15 takes the form <?hbn9vhC (instead of <?hb`9) and the
Set 2 form becomes <rn9v`C (instead of <r`9).","[329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334]"

Set 2a pronominal subject clitics, hence one finds <G<rTj ‘that, because you (sg.)’ for second
singular. It is not yet known in what circumstances <G is chosen over the regular Subordinate

have.party=PAST.INFER.3pl‘I guess they were having a party.’
Jacobsen (1973: 19) records that the regular past tense clitic <(a)hs may precede the non-past
inferential shown in (386). The semantic difference between this and the past inferential in (387),
if any, is unknown.
7.2.9Inferential I (Nuuchahnulth)The Inferential I mood is to be compared to the other two Nuuchahnulth non-quotative evidential
moods below, the Inferential II (§7.2.17) and the Dubitative (§7.2.18). The first Inferential does
not question the actuality of the event itself as strongly as the Dubitative, but often denotes that
some aspect of it (cause, duration, etc.) has been inferred by the speaker rather than being definitely known. In (388)a, for example, it is not the sleeping that is in doubt, but its duration. In
(388)b, it simply indicates that the event has been learned about after the fact through its effects,
rather than being witnessed directly.

Jacobsen (1973: 19) describes the function of this mood, which he calls the “realizational”, as
“indicating that the speaker has only belatedly perceived, learned, or realized a fact ...”. It also
seems that the fact is generally surprising or unexpected in some way, which makes this mood a
marker of mirativity, as this is described by DeLancey (1997).

Conditional concessive.

Jacobsen (1973: 11) notes a related formation he calls the “counterfactual”, which involves the
Conditional plus the formative ,E`9, as in Ihbtwi`cHpdxE@rHj ‘I wish I were an Indian’.
Speakers I checked with recognized the form, but felt it was archaic and suggested the simple
Conditional instead: Ihbtwi`cHpdxrHj. This may be a result of attrition of more recondite forms
in a language death situation. (In Nuuchahnulth, wishes have been observed in the Subordinate
mood with the irrealis future clitic N <(x)hj: JhlrRhF`shjp`r ‘may I be bitten, i.e. let my bait be
taken!’ at NT 108.8 JhlrRhQ ‘bite on bait’; see also (394)a.)
f) The Conditional may also be used as an indefinite or non-specific article in RPs, replacing the
regular article clitic:280(401)MAKAHa. Ftrta`r

The Conditional may co-occur with the Quotative mood clitic in Nuuchahnulth. Normally,
the Conditional precedes the Quotative:

In Nuuchahnulth, Conditional clauses that are part of a sentence with multiple mood-marked
clauses can be marked as hearsay by the quotative formative <C. For example, the sentence in
(403) is a conditional sentence with two finite clauses, an if-clause (the protasis) and a thenclause (the apodosis). The protasis rhosTo FtpQMtJi`I`spTC ‘if one is holding a stick’ has the
Conditional clitic in combination with <C.

in relative clauses in which the identity of the referent is unknown or inferred by the speaker (cf.
the Nuuchahnulth Indefinite Relative, §7.2.14).

7.2.13 Definite Relative (Nuuchahnulth)
The Definite Relative forms relative clauses in which the identity or fact of existence of the referent is known or presupposed by both speaker and addressee, either from previous discourse or
world knowledge (cf. the Indefinite Relative, §7.2.14).

is implied by YhmsF`s`Q ‘blew her nose’ (lit. ‘had nasal mucus come off’) and therefore known to

The fact that the speaker’s club in (407) has an imaginary canoe is established by the preceding
sentence in the text: ‘They refer to them as “thus many in a crew” because the clubs are pretendedly in canoes’.
A Definite Relative clitic hosted by a verbal predicate with a non-relative root forms a temporal adverbial clause:

7.2.14 Indefinite Relative (Nuuchahnulth)
This mood forms relative clauses in which the referent or the referent’s identity is new or unidentifiable. Example (409) takes place on a canoe trip through Barkley Sound (in Tseshaht territory).","[288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298]"
"3.2 Automatic alternations
3.2.1UmlautThe low central vowels /` @/ are raised and fronted to /d D/ when followed in the next syllable
by /h/ or /H/ and only /F/ intervenes (Sapir 1924: 85, note 22). This environment may occur in
derivation when a suffix or clitic beginning with glottal stop and a high front vowel is added to a
base ending in /`/ or /@/ (26)a-b, or it may occur morpheme-internally (26)c:33(26)‘many’→F`xdFh‘the many’F@m`‘thus long’→F@mdFhr‘short’b. BHp@‘chanting’→BHpDFh‘the ones chanting’F`m@‘thus far’→F`mDFH‘get to be thus far’a. F`x`c. jdFhr‘going directly where one is going without swerving or pausing’vdFhC‘sleeping’XdFhrh‘common clam, butter clam’As noted earlier (§2.2), the umlauted vowels are articulatorily distinct from the allophones of the
high vowels lowered by pharyngeals and (sporadically) uvular consonants. Sapir (1924: 85-86,
note 22) writes: “[T]hese [umlauted] vowels are felt as distinct from secondary d, ε, and D …
that are merely lowered from h, H because of preceding or following velar consonant.” (By “velar” he means “uvular.” It is unclear why there is no mention of the lowering by pharyngeals). He
also describes the umlauted vowels as “open”, probably indicating a lax quality versus the tenser
quality of the high vowels lowered by the pharyngeals (and uvulars). The fact that the two sets of
phones, the umlaut set and the lowered set, are distinct removes the possibility of a violation of
bi-uniqueness, i.e. a situation in which a single allophone belongs to two phonemes.
This umlaut process occurs throughout the southern region of the Southern Wakashan speaking area: in Makah, Ditidaht, and the southern dialects of Nuuchahnulth represented in Sapir and
Swadesh’s texts (Tseshaht and Ucluelet). More northerly dialects of Nuuchahnulth like Ahousaht
and Kyuquot retain original /` @/, cf. Ahousaht ji`Fh9Q ‘sit down on the ground’ (Nakayama
1997a: 19, ex. 20) (Tseshaht jidFHQ), Ahousaht, Kyuquot v`FhC ‘sleeping’ (Nakayama 1997a:
150, ex. 246; Rose 1981: 61, ex. 121).
3.2.2Neutralization of labialized and non-labialized consonantsThe contrast between labialized and non-labialized consonants is neutralized in several environments (cf. Sapir 1924: 87, note 33, 89, note 58, Swadesh 1933: 10, 1939: 80, Jacobsen 1969b).","[48, 49]"

"258Turning now to the distribution of the sets by mood, Set 1 occurs by itself to express Indicative mood. It probably also follows the Purposive clitic <""`9, but this mood is not fully attested
(§7.2.5). Set 2a occurs in absolute predicates and with the Subordinate mood and the various evidential moods (Quotative, Inferential, etc.). Set 2b occurs only with the Conditional mood
<pdx(t) (§7.2.6). Set 2c occurs with the Relative mood and the two Interrogative moods. (These
mood-pronominal set combinations are repeated in Table 16.)
Third person plural non-subjects can be indicated by the third plural clitic <`9K (§7.4.1) following the first singular and plural and second singular forms in Table 15 (for second plural with
third plural see below). This third plural marking is apparently limited to human and perhaps
higher animate non-subjects. When followed by <`9K, the non-Indicative sets (Sets 2a-c) reduce
to a single set of forms equivalent to Set 2a. That is, non-Indicative first singular is always <rh9
with <`9K, second singular is <rt9, etc. This formal syncretism suggests that originally there
were only two sets, Indicative and non-Indicative (modern Set 2a). The longer variants these
forms show with other post-modal clitics point to the same conclusion.
The <`9K plural clitic cannot follow the second person plural clitic. Jacobsen (1973: 5-6)
plausibly relates this expressive gap to potential loss of semantic contrast, e.g. adding third plural
<`9K to Set 1 (Indicative) second plural <?hb`9 would produce *<?hb@K on the surface –– the
same form that expresses Indicative second singular subject and third plural non-subject. He
(1973: 6) also describes several “work around” strategies, the simplest of which is to ignore the
plurality of the non-subject.
Third person subject, intransitive or with third person non-subject
Third person singular Indicative intransitive subjects are expressed by the clitic <?h. As with first
and second persons, the same clitic is used with third person non-subjects. Third plural intransitive subjects (or, again, third plural subjects with third non-subjects) add a short-vowel variant of
the third plural suffix, <`K, to produce <?hK. Third plural non-subjects cannot be indicated with a259third person subject. If the plurality of a third person P argument must be expressed (often, of
course, it is simply unexpressed), a passive is used, which allows it to be coded as subject.
There is no third person singular non-Indicative clitic: third person singular non-Indicative
subject is either zero or indicated by a variant shape of the mood clitic; these are listed below.
Third person plural non-Indicative is expressed by yet another variant of the third plural clitic,
<?`K. The restriction against marking a third person plural non-subject with a third plural subject
also applies to non-Indicative forms.
Throughout the preceding discussion readers may have noted the lack of any forms with third
person subjects and first or second person non-subjects. This is explained by the hierarchical pattern of subject choice described in §4.4.2 and §7.3.5; propositions with a third person A and first
or second person P are expressed by a passive-inverse construction with the first or second P
coded as subject.
Mood clitics
The mood clitics are listed in Table 16.99 A couple have variant forms in past tense that are explained in the relevant sections below. The shapes that appear with first and second person pronominals are listed separately from the one indicating third person, if they differ. The Content Interrogative clitic has three forms. The first occurs with first and second person singular intransitive subject pronominals; the second occurs with all other first and second person pronominals;
the third is the third person form. Hyphens in the representation of a clitic indicate possible etymological boundaries between modal formatives. The third column of the table indicates the pronominal set from Table 15 that accompanies the clitic.
Paradigms for most common and fully attested moods in Makah are laid out in the tables following the mood table.","[273, 274, 275]"
"48In the remainder of this section I have provided examples of each template with a variety of
base types, i.e. bases with different numbers of syllables, as well as bases that already partially or
fully meet templatic specifications. Since I have only used attested examples for the following
catalog, it has not been possible to give the full range of base types for some of the less common
templates. For simplicity, the bases are underived in most cases.
The block of examples for each template begins with its CV schema, as listed in (41). This is
followed by the mnemonic abbreviation in square brackets, e.g. template (a) is abbreviated as [L].
In parentheses I indicate the approximate number of affixes associated with each template. We
begin with examples of three neutral affixes.

Complex (i.e. multiple-predicate) constructions, which we continue our discussion of in this section, are very frequent in Southern Wakashan and classifying them into a definitive set of types is
far from straightforward. Rose (1981), Jacobsen (1993), and Nakayama (1997a) provide three
alternative views of how to divide up the pie. I make a few comments below on differences149among the various schemes, but a comprehensive evaluation of them is a task for the future. The
main area of difference is the status of different kinds of absolute predicates.
The difficulty in classifying multi-predicate constructions arises mostly from the scarce marking of grammatical relationships between words and clauses. The analyst is often left attempting
to differentiate constructions by subtle and sometimes apparently statistical behavioral characteristics of uncertain grammatical significance. Jacobsen (1993: 239-40) provides a useful summary
of the analytic problems one encounters.
Keeping the preceding caveat in mind, I recognize the following types of clauses in complex
constructions: the referring phrases described in §4.5 (i.e. “nominalized” clauses), adverbial
clauses (§4.6.1), and complement clauses (§4.6.2).
4.6.1Adverbial clauses4.6.1.1Bare absolute constructionsAn exceedingly common sentence-building device in Southern Wakashan is to introduce one or
more bare absolute predicates into a sentence with an adverbial function. These elaborate on, expand, or modify the meaning of the main predicate. Subjects must be coreferential.

purposes. One frequently finds sentences composed of two transitive predicates in which one
predicate expresses something of the specific manner or type of action affecting the object while
the other expresses the general relation of subject to object. The general relation is often coded by
a verbalizing lexical suffix. For example, in the Nuuchahnulth examples in (240) we see the following distribution of meanings between predicates:
General Relation of ParticipantsSpecific Manner/Type of Action

The semantic patterns are sometimes easier to see with literal translations, e.g.
(240)a: ‘She gave [relation] the women calico by potlatching [manner of action] it to them’
(240)d: ‘She was consuming [relation] worm-wood by eating [manner of action] it’.64151Instrumentals, locations, and other adjunct participants can be introduced into a sentence with
a bare absolute construction (241). Note that here, unlike the construction in (240), the objects of
the transitive predicates in (241)b-d are not co-referential. (The locative RP in (241)e l`GSHFh
‘the house’ is not an object, but rather an oblique in construction with ghK`prtF`rG ‘while there
in front (of)’.)

The following Makah vocabulary is offered as a preliminary and highly selective survey of the
Makah lexicon, pending completion of a full dictionary currently in the planning stages at the
Makah Cultural and Research Center and the Makah Language Program.
Bound roots are given with the perfective suffix, if it is attested with the root, followed by
one or more of the basic imperfective forms (i.e. continuative, durative, repetitive). Other aspects
are occasionally given if they have specialized meanings with that root. Aspects that are known to
occur with a root but that are not listed separately are noted in parentheses. Attested combining
forms of free roots are listed first, followed by the free form. Perfective or (perfective) inceptive
aspect forms of free roots are sometimes included as well, if attested.
Possible Nuuchahnulth cognates or partial cognates from Sapir & Swadesh (1939) are given
in brackets following the aspect forms.
A selection of derivatives containing more or less productive lexical suffixes is included at
the end of entries. Derivatives with special lexical suffixes or non-productive lexical suffixes are
generally given their own entries.
Short final vowels, which are not present in surface form due to an apocope rule (§3.4.3), are
indicated where evidence is sufficient to determine their existence and quality. Word-final labialization of velars and uvulars following a consonant or /` h/ is indicated where its existence is
known. See §3.2.2 for word-final labialization following /t/.

3.3.7Final /K/ deletionAll restrictive locative suffixes (§5.5.2) with final /tK/ or /TK/ and one with final /HK/ (,oHK ‘in
the middle’) undergo deletion of the /K/ when they precede glottalizing/leniting suffixes and a few
other suffixes, e.g. ,l` ,hl ,tl ‘... thing’, ,h9G plural. This is signaled in underlying form by
parentheses around the deleting consonant, e.g. ,(p)T(K) ‘on the face’. By the processes described
in §3.3.2 and §3.3.3, a glottal stop is inserted between the deleting final (prior to deletion) and
glottalizing/leniting suffixes. This leaves a vowel-F-vowel sequence after deletion of /K/. This sequence is never subject to the reduction processes in §3.3.4.

Strictly speaking, marking suffixes that undergo deletion with a diacritic is redundant, since,
with the exception of ,oH(K) ‘in the middle’, it is entirely predictable which suffixes fall into this
category based on morpheme class and phonological shape. It is useful as a mnemonic device,
though, because there are many other locative and non-locative suffixes that end in /K/, including
a few non-locative suffixes that end in /tK/, that do not undergo deletion. These are subject to
regular glottalization and lenition processes described in §3.3.2 and §3.3.3.

The final /Q/ in all allomorphs of the perfective aspect suffix and in all portmanteau morphemes with a perfective component, whether suffixes or roots, is lost before glottalizing clitics.
A non-reducing glottal stop is inserted between morpheme and clitic. This is not marked by any
diacritic since it applies with absolute regularity to forms signaling this grammatical category.

Several inherently perfective suffixes ending in /Q/ also undergo /Q/-deletion, which suggests
that they may have the perfective suffix as an etymological component. Among these suffixes are
,`v`Q [L] ‘find, come upon ... (perf.)’, ,""HQ ‘lose ... (perf.)’, ,""hQ [L] ‘go for, get, invite ...

or coda nasal, but lost when they follow consonant-final bases. The following consonants are subject to initial deletion in a least one suffix: /C jip m R v x X/. There are other suffixes beginning
with each of these consonants that never undergo initial deletion. Deleting consonants are symbolized with parentheses, e.g. ,(p)@r ‘daughter of ...’. Compare this suffix in (113) to ,pH ‘on

"273 Phonological Alternations
A variety of phonological alternations take place during word formation, the most important and
common of which are described in this chapter. The presentation is descriptive in intent and informal for the most part, although, for descriptive purposes, it does assume a model of phonology
with extrinsically ordered rules applied to underlying forms.
The alternations are presented in order of application to underlying forms except that the
automatic alternations in §3.2 are ordered after the morpheme-specific alternations in §3.3 even
though they are described first for expository reasons. The important issue of vowel-length alternations is discussed apart from the other alternations in §3.1. Only alternations of some generality
are discussed individually in this chapter; those that are restricted to a few morphemes or are
rarely encountered are introduced as necessary.
Underlying forms, which do double duty as citation forms, frequently contain diacritics that
specify how or if certain morpheme-specific rules apply. It has not been possible to avoid using
morphemes with diacritics in examples before the diacritics themselves have been introduced;
readers may consult the list of abbreviations and symbols after the Table of Contents for brief
explanations of them. Most are used in the same way as in Sapir and Swadesh’s works, where
they were originally introduced (see especially Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 236-39), although their
diacritic conventions have been simplified in a few cases. Some of their original diacritics are
used to abbreviate sets of allomorphs (cf. McCawley 1967: 108): they represent the phonological
properties of each allomorph in a single citation form by “superimposing” the allomorphs on one
another. Sometimes, however, the present analysis posits a single underlying form for such lexical items rather than an allomorph set, which eliminates the need for Sapir and Swadesh’s diacritic. For example, labialized consonants alternate with their non-labialized homorganic counterparts in word-final position and a few other environments (§3.2.2), e.g. we find l`l@rhX`ji,Hb28‘belonging to a mud shark’, but l`l@rhX`j ‘mud shark’ without the suffix. In Sapir and
Swadesh’s analysis, the ‘mud shark’ root has two allomorphs, the word-final allomorph
/l`l@rhX`j/ and the pre-vowel allomorph /l`l@rhX`ji,/. They merge these to produce the
citation form l`l@rhX`j(i,), where the parentheses and hyphen show that the labialized allomorph appears before vowel-initial suffixes. The analysis proposed in §3.2.2, on the other hand,
posits the underlying form l`l@rhX`ji and an automatic delabialization rule. With this analysis
the parentheses and hyphen are redundant: since no labialized final consonant fails to alternate in
the relevant environment, there is no need for a special mark to signal the alternation.12
Many of the alternations described in this chapter are triggered by affixation. The language
distinguishes an inner layer of affixes, mostly suffixes but also a few infixes, from an outer layer
of enclitics. The inner affixes include various aspectual formatives and “lexical” suffixes, suffixes
with relatively concrete meanings like the verbalizing suffix ,rhlC ‘doing ritual for ...’. The clitics are more loosely joined to their host phonologically, and typically have more abstract grammatical functions than inner-layer affixes, coding grammatical categories like tense, mood, and
person and number of the subject. The inner affixes and the clitics behave differently with regard
to several of the phonological alternations described. Differences will be noted piecemeal as we
go along, and a summary list of them can be found in Chapter 7.","[42, 43, 44]"
"1795.3 Classification of suffixes
The 500 or so suffixes can be grouped into a number of categories on the basis of common semantic features and shared grammatical behavior. The broadest classification divides them into
three groups.
1. Formative suffixes, e.g. M ,h9c`, N ,hm, M ,Bhc`, N ,Bhsh
2. Aspect suffixes, e.g. M, N ,`ji ,tj durative imperfective, M, N ,RhQ perfective
3. Lexical suffixes, e.g. N ,LHs ‘son of ...’, M ,dx`W, N ,hx`pG [R] ‘singing ... song’
Formative suffixes are semantically empty suffixes that create the free forms of composite free
roots. Most formative suffixes are used with noun roots. For example, the Nuuchahnulth noun
roots Bhwi`s, ‘eagle’ and Y`xtwi`, ‘cod-fish decoy’ appear as words with the formative suffix
-hm: Bhwi`shm, Y`xtwihm. There are at least two dozen of these formative suffixes. They are discussed in more detail above in §5.2.2.
The dozen or so aspect suffixes make up part of the aspect system, a central grammatical
category in Southern Wakashan. Aspect is described in Chapter 6.
By far the majority of suffixes are lexical suffixes. Lexical suffixes are a Northwest Coast
areal phenomenon that also appears in Salish languages, and Quileute.76 They earned this name
because they have meanings more typical cross-linguistically of open-class lexical morphemes
than closed-class grammatical morphemes. They express a wide range of concepts, and researchers on languages that have them have proposed various semantic classification schemes. Boas
(1947: 236-7) expresses reservations about classifications of this sort on the grounds they impose
categories of the researchers’ languages on the languages of study, but concludes in the end that
they are harmless and descriptively useful as long as it is clear that they make no claim to represent native classifications.","[194, 195]"

Iterative I normally applies only to roots, not to derived bases. There are a few exceptions in
Nuuchahnulth, e.g. ghQghrs`pR ‘come from at intervals’, from ghr, ‘there’ + ,s`p ‘come from’.
Derived bases always seem to have /Q/ inserted in the coda of the reduplicated syllable.
There are some complexities with regard to vowel length. Often, length is unchanged in either the reduplicated syllable or the original first syllable. Sometimes, however, one finds the
original first syllable lengthened (e.g. M ji`Qji@C ‘back up at intervals; lobster’ < ji`, ‘move
backwards’, N rtQrTj ‘take up at intervals’ in (350)c), or both vowels lengthened (e.g. M
B@B@FtpR ‘gaffing fish’ < *B`Ftp, not attested outside this formation, N m@rpm@rpR < m`rp,
‘beat time with sticks’ at NA 398.14). Rose (1981: 277) analyzes forms in Kyuquot dialect like242m@rpm@rpR with both vowels lengthened as composed of the iterative plus the graduative, and
says that they contrast semantically with the forms lacking the long vowels. She writes that the
iterative “denotes sporadic occurrence of an event” (p. 271), while the so-called “graduative iterative” “indicates that the iterativity is more intense, frequent, or progressive” (p. 277). I have been
unable to evaluate this claim for the Tseshaht corpus because forms with both vowels lengthened
are exceedingly rare, only two have turned up so far, and the translations are not precise enough
for comparison with other forms. Makah iteratives with one or two long vowels do not seem to
have contrasting forms with short vowels.
6.5.5.2Formation of iterative IIThe formation of iterative II is based on the perfective (or perfective inceptive) form of a word.
We first consider iterative II formation in Nuuchahnulth. Two operations are involved:
1. Change the final /Q/ of the perfective suffix to /K/.
2. Lengthen the first two vowels and the last vowel (normally the vowel of the perfective
suffix) of the resulting word and shorten all other vowels. In disyllabic bases both vowels
are lengthened. In trisyllabic bases it is optional whether the second vowel is long or
short (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 239).
For example,

form with a coda nasal in the final syllable requires no additional lengthening there.

Bases ending in these suffixes form the iterative II in one of two ways. Some simply add the
allomorph of the perfective suffix they would take if the suffix were not inherently perfective and
apply the regular iterative II length changes:

The iterative II form here, jihrCHrhK ‘get to be on a different one at intervals’ is formed by simply
changing the final /Q/ of the perfective suffix to /K/, mirroring step one of the Nuuchahnulth formation as described above. More thorough description must await further examples.
6.5.5.3Comparison of functionsGiven the current dearth of Makah iterative II examples, we must confine our semantic comparison of the iterative I and II formations to Nuuchahnulth. In most cases, iterative I and iterative II
are in complementary distribution: iterative I applies to bare roots and iterative II applies to derived words, with no apparent difference in meaning. Both formations express an irregularly
spaced (or at least not necessarily regularly spaced) series of repetitions of an action or event.

then’ (< B`wi, ‘(to) spear’ + iterative I). These translations might imply that the repetitions must
be temporally distant from one another, perhaps days or weeks apart, and that the series as whole
occurs over a considerable length of time, but no such restrictions exist: B`wB`wR can denote a
series of events that lasts only a few minutes. The temporally extended sense may be more typical
though; in fact, iteratives sometimes have a habitual connotation, as shown by their tendency to
lexicalize as deverbal nouns (§8.2.1), e.g. CHCHv`GrTK ‘bureau (of drawers), lit. gets pulled out
at intervals’ < CH ‘pull’ + ,v`Grt(K) ‘move out’ + iterative II.97
Exceptions have been recorded to the generalization that iterative I and iterative II are merely
formal alternates. For example, Sapir (1924: 87, note 37) notes for the root Qtoj, Qhlj, ‘awake’
that the iterative II form (which he calls the “durative iterative”) QTojRHK ‘to be waking up time
and again’ contrasts with the iterative I form (which he calls the “momentaneous iterative”)
QtojQtojR or QhljQhljR ‘to keep waking up by fits and starts’. More investigation is necessary to see how general the possibility for such contrasts is, but, at this point, it appears limited.","[257, 258, 259, 260, 261]"

Rose (1981: 263) and Nakayama (1997a: 27) both analyze the continuative as indicating that
“a dynamic situation ... is enduring through time” (Rose 1981: 263). This definition is adequate as
long as “dynamic” is defined along the lines suggested by Comrie (1976: 13): “[Dynamic situations] require a continual input of energy if they are not to come to an end”. That is, there need be
no activity or change per se, but some energy or force must be exerted to maintain the situation. A
crucial set of examples shows that activity and change are not required to license the continuative.
Along with dynamic process roots like M, N Eh, ‘cut’ and M, N BHp, ‘chant’, the continuative
also regularly occurs with roots denoting attachment, adhesion, holding, etc: M, N JT ‘hooked’,
N Btop@ ‘stuck in, planted’, M Jihs@, N Jihm@ ‘stuck on’, M I`o@, N I`l@ ‘two-pronged
object clamped on (e.g. clothespin on line)’, M a`Q@, N l`Q@ ‘tied’, M a@, N L@ ‘holding in

none of the situations they denote can be described as action or change. Any of them could undergo change of some sort, e.g. something can suddenly become unstuck from a surface, or ropes
can gradually loosen around a bundle, but change is not intrinsic to their nature as it is with a
situation like that denoted by Eh, ‘cut’. But neither are they inherently stable –– some application
of force, external or internal, is necessary for the maintenance of the expressed configuration.
Application of force seems to be the core meaning of this use of the continuative.
In Nuuchahnulth, when the continuative occurs with stative roots it expresses imperfective
inception: stpi@ ‘melting’ (stp,), bhj@ ‘becoming aslant, overbalanced’ (bhj,), Ihr@ ‘whitening, dawning’ (Ihr, ‘white, bright’).

FHpGH IhrÊ(x)@<""`Qdark–in.airstillbright–CONT=TEMP‘It was still a bit dark as it dawned.’ (NA 157.8)
In this use, the continuative appears to overlap the graduative (§6.5.1). It is not known whether a
root like stp, ‘melted’ also occurs with the graduative (added to its perfective form), and, if so,
how this form is different in meaning from the continuative, i.e. do we find sTpRhQ ‘melting’
along with stpi@ ‘melting’?
In their list of Nuuchahnulth “primary stems” (1939: 243-316), Sapir and Swadesh record
most bound verb roots as occuring with the continuative, e.g. Btpi@ ‘to punch’, CtWi@ ‘to
tickle’, stwi@ ‘to jump’. In Makah, the continuative is generally disallowed with such roots, the
repetitive (§6.5.4) being preferred instead as the basic imperfective aspect. In this language, the
continuative appears restricted to situations that are truly continuous, involving little internal
structure and no distinguishable phases. Some light is shed on this by HW’s response when queried about Btpi@ ‘punching’. Initially, she disallowed the formation. When asked what the word
would have to mean if it were used,94 she said (paraphrasing), “You’d have to be like Popeye af-237ter he ate spinach”, referring to an almost superhuman continuous blur of punches. After further
reflection she decided the word might be possible to describe the action in a boxing match, although the repetitive BtpTBTp would still be preferred.
6.5.4RepetitiveThe repetitive generally applies only to roots and is formed by the suffix ,(x)` plus repetitive reduplication (symbolized [RepR]), which involves full reduplication of monosyllabic roots with
both the reduplicative vowel and the original first syllable vowel long (346)a,d.95 If the root ends
in a vowel, /Q/ is inserted in the coda of the reduplicative syllable (346)b,e. Polysyllabic roots
have initial CV reduplication with both vowels lengthened (346)c,f. Due to the apocope rule described in §3.4.3, the final vowel of the repetitive suffix in Makah is not evident in surface forms
if it is word final.

stop) are subject to the epenthesis rule described in §3.4.3. As usual, insertion of the long epenthetic vowel induces shortening of the initial long vowel.

The repetitive has relatively uncomplicated semantics. It expresses a series of regularly
spaced iterations of an event. Unlike an iterative series (§6.5.5), the series of iterations expressed
by the repetitive typically takes place over a relatively short space of time and requires an agentive subject. In a pattern apparently first noticed by Rose (1981: 278), the repetitive participates in
a type of split intransitivity: stative intransitive roots are transitive in the repetitive, while dynamic intransitive roots remain intransitive. (349) shows several Nuuchahnulth examples.

→s@ws@w` ‘spit repeatedly’ *‘cause ...’
sTwsTwi` ‘jumping’ *‘cause ...’
bHpbHp` ‘speaking’ *‘cause ...’One area that requires further research is the difference in meaning between the continuative
and repetitive aspects with roots like M, N Eh, ‘cut’. In isolation, of course, there is a difference
in translation: with the continuative (M Ehjx@, N Ehx@) this root is translated ‘cutting’ and with
the repetitive form (M EhQHEHx, N EHQEHx`), ‘cutting repeatedly’. In context it is not so clear
what the distinction is. For example, in Makah, ‘she is cutting (the) fish’ is equally well expressed240by either. I examined this issue with speaker HW at some length but was unable to pin down a
difference, although she seemed to feel that there was one.
6.5.5IterativeThe iterative is formed in two ways, which I will refer to as iterative I and iterative II. In some
cases, iterative I and II appear to contrast semantically, but in most other cases, they do not. As an
initial approximation, both can be translated as ‘do X at intervals’. I first describe the formation
of iterative I and II (§§6.5.5.1-6.5.5.2), and then compare their functions (§6.5.5.3).
6.5.5.1Formation of iterative IIterative I involves the suffix ,R (,C after vowels except ,j after /t/ in Nuuchahnulth) plus a
unique iterative I CV template, symbolized [IterR]: full reduplication of a monosyllabic root plus
insertion of /Q/ in the coda of the reduplicative syllable if the root ends in a vowel (350)a,c-e.96 In
a few cases /Q/ is inserted even with consonant-final roots in Nuuchahnulth. Polysyllabic roots

the affix is from the portion of the word specified by the template, either in number of syllables or
in number of morphemes. The locative suffix -`oh ‘in the air, erect; standing’ selects the (a) template. If attached to the four syllable (synchronically) monomorphemic base j`Kjhms`ohlK,
‘strawberry’, the first syllable must be long even though the affix itself is separated from it by
several intervening syllables:
(48)j@Kjhms`ohlKÊ`oh‘strawberry up in the air’Similarly, the word F`E`otFhKhl ‘a pad underneath’ consists of four morphemes, the root F`C,
‘support with a block or pad’ and three neutral (not associated with a template) suffixes, ,""`ot(K),
‘underneath’, ,#hK ‘in the house’, and -hl ‘... thing’ (lit. ‘thing serving as a pad underneath in the
house’). If affixed by the suffix -GVhmji [L] ‘using ...’, which selects the (a) template, the first
syllable is lengthened despite the three suffixes between the specifying suffix and the specified
syllable:
(49)F@EÊ`otÊFhKÊhlÊGVhmj‘using a pad underneath’Affixes are subject to their own templatic specification if their position in a base is within
their template’s domain. Let us consider a straightforward example. The suffix -bh9Xtj [L+S]
‘going to ...’ is associated with the (b) template, the two-syllable template that requires the first
syllable of the word to be long and the second syllable short. If this suffix is affixed to a monosyllabic base such as the relative root pih, ‘whoever, whatever’, the persistently long first syllable of45the suffix ends up as the second syllable of the resultant base and is thus subject to shortening by
the template: piHbhXtj ‘wherever one is going’:
(50)underlying→B0 UG0 B1 E1pihÊbh9Xtj→pi H b h---XtjA word can contain multiple template-specifying affixes (suffixes or infixes). Three types of
interactions are possible. The affixes can specify 1) the same template, 2) compatible templates,
or 3) conflicting templates. The result of the first situation can be predicted from the principles I
described above: because a base that conforms to a particular template requires no alteration upon
addition of an affix associated with that template, we would correctly predict that a given template is only applied once; addition of a second affix associated with the same template as an earlier affix will thus produce no change. Example (51) demonstrates this with a word with two affixes specifying template (a):
(51)FTrhlCM`Gh
FtÊrhlC [L]ÊM`Gh [L]
so.and.so–do.ritual.for–ready.to‘ready to perform a ritual for it’
Assuming that templates are applied in order from left to right as their affixes are added to the
base, we would expect the effects of compatible templates to be cumulative. That is, effects of
later templates are applied to the form that results from application of earlier templates. Examples
like (52) seem to bear this out:
(52)Y@Y`pl`pJtji`MTG
Y`pÊl`pÊJtj [R]Ê@Mt(K) [L]Êh9G [L]
grass–plant–resemble–along.length–PL‘made of hemp rope, pl.’ (NA 63.46)
The leftmost non-neutral suffix is -Jtj (,l`p, ‘... plant’ is neutral), which is associated with
template (d), initial CV reduplication with nonspecified vowel length. This template applied to
the underlying form Y`pl`pJtj produces Y`Y`pl`pJtj. The (a) template associated with46-@Mt(K) [L] ‘along a length’ is then applied producing Y@Y`pl`pJtji`MtK. Addition of the plural suffix ,h9G rounds out the attested form. (The final /K/ of ,@Mt(K) is deleted before the plural
suffix.)
Following the same logic, conflicting templatic effects ought to be resolved by the later template undoing the effects of the earlier template. Conflicts always involve conflicting length requirements. For example, when a suffix specifying the (a) template (long first syllable) is followed by a suffix that specifies the (c) template (first and second syllables both short), the resultant word should have a short first syllable. Comparison of (53)a-b supports this hypothesis:
(53)a. F@S@MtK
F`S`Ê@Mt(K) [L]
thick–along.length‘thick along its length’
b. F`S`MtK`p`p
F`S`Ê@Mt(K) [L]Ê`p`p [S+S]
thick–along.length–very‘very thick along its length’
The effect of the (a) template of -@Mt(K) [L] ‘along a length’ has been undone in (53)b by the (c)
template associated with ,(p)`p ,`p`p [S+S] ‘very’.
Although examples (51)-(53) are preliminary support for our predictions about templatic interactions, more study is necessary to determine how consistently they are born out. Rose (1981:
341) reports restrictions against the co-occurrence of suffixes associated with certain templates,
e.g. (g) and (h), in Kyuquot dialect. I suspect this is a consequence of the semantic or grammatical incompatibility of the suffixes rather than an inherent property of the templates themselves.
She also reports a dominance hierarchy among certain templates that determines which will prevail in combination. These possibilities require further investigation for Tseshaht. Incidentally,
affixes are frequently associated with different templates in Kyuquot and Tseshaht, e.g. -(b)rS`K
‘reciprocally’ is neutral in Tseshaht but associated with template (i) in Kyuquot (Rose 1981: 361).","[60, 61, 62]"
"1264.4.3.2Nominal predicatesNominal predicate heads in Southern Wakashan occur in three construction types: class-inclusion
predicates, equational constructions, and existential constructions.
Class-inclusion predicates
In Makah and Nuuchahnulth, nominals may function directly as predicate heads with no intervening copular element.52 They take predicate clitics exactly as verbal predicates do: there are no restrictions on the predicate clitics they may occur with. The words in (205)-(206) show Makah
nouns and property words as heads of class-inclusion predicates; that is, predicates denoting a
class of entities the subject is asserted to be a member of.53 Example (207) shows an intransitive
verbal predicate for comparison. The coding of each clause type is identical: the mood and pronominal clitics are attached directly to the predicate head in all cases. (Only the masculine singular gloss is given for the third person examples for sake of economy.)

the past tense noun, property, and verbal predicates in (208).54 Polar Interrogative mood is used
in these examples instead of Indicative mood for sake of variety, and also to further illustrate the
ability of nominal words to occur with mood and subject clitics. Only second person singular127forms are given, the possibility of nominal predicates occurring with all persons being amply
demonstrated by (205) and (206). Second person singular is zero-marked with this mood in
Makah (§7.2.1)

The homogeneity of coding across word classes demonstrated for mood-marked predicates in
(205)-(208) extends to absolute predicates as well. Examples (209)a-c show a noun, a property
word, and an intransitive verb as bare absolute predicates in complements to the negative root

property + noun, a quantifier + noun, etc.). The words in a multi-word nominal predicate head are
usually strictly ordered: quantifier/numeral > property > noun. Clitics must occur on the first
word of the head. Example (210) shows two multi-word nominal predicates; the predicated expression in (210)a is M FhFHWi PhcHQ ‘big dog’ and, in (210)b, it is N QtK g`Ftl ‘good food’.
Note the position of the predicate modifier XTpi@ ‘likewise’ following g`Ftl in (210)b; its
location is evidence that the string QtKF`Q g`Ftl is indeed a unitary predicate head, since, as
described in §4.3.4, post-head predicate modifiers usually directly follow the predicate head and
precede core arguments.

Equational clauses
Within the major clause types in a language one often finds subtypes with different coding properties that vary according to the semantic or grammatical properties of the lexical items functioning in predicates (e.g. transitive and intransitive subtypes of verbal predication), or according to
different functional predication types possible with expressions headed by the same word class.
An important distinction of the latter sort among nominal predicates is between clauses with
class-inclusion predicates (called “true nominal predicates” by Dryer [to appear]) and those with
equational predicates. In a (declarative) class-inclusion clause the subject is asserted to be a
member of the class of entities denoted by the predicate, e.g. John is a teacher. An equational129clause, on the other hand, asserts that the individual denoted by the predicate is the same as the
individual denoted by the subject, i.e. the latter is equated with the former, e.g. John is the
teacher. In English, the two types are distinguished in several ways (Lyons 1977: 471-72, Dryer
[to appear]). The examples in the previous section are of the class-inclusion type, e.g. (205)a M
vhjvHx@jr ‘I am a boy’. We see from those examples that class-inclusion clauses in Southern
Wakashan have the nominal expression as the (syntactic) predicate head. Clauses with equational
predicates are formed at least two ways. The first, and less preferred, way, only attested in Nuuchahnulth, is to use the same construction found in class-inclusion clauses: the entity to which the
subject is equated serves as predicate head with the appropriate predicate clitics attached:
(211)NUUCHAHNULTHG`VhKl`
G`VhK<l@ghK
ghKchief=INDICtherewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww‘He is the chief there.’ (based on NA 47.2)
Although the translation of (211) in the source and its discourse context make clear that it is to be
taken as equational, out of context it is presumably ambiguous between class-inclusion and equational readings, i.e. out of context (211) could also mean ‘He is a chief (i.e. high ranking male)
there’. (The usual English gloss for G`VhK, ‘chief’, is misleading because it implies unique status
for its referent in a group. The word actually refers to any high-ranking male, so a group can have
more than one G`VhK –– the class-inclusion reading is perfectly plausible, and, as we see next, is
probably preferred.)
The second, and more common, construction involves pronouns interposed as copular elements. This is in fact the only possible construction if the (semantic) predicate is a personal name,
place name, an RP with the article, or, in Makah, an RP with a possessive clitic, because these
types of nominal expressions cannot normally function as syntactic predicate heads:55130(212)MAKAHa. *BillFh

(The prohibition against co-occurrence of mood clitics and the article will be shown to be natural
when I suggest in §4.5.1 that the article itself is a mood clitic.)
The precise form of the correct construction in Nuuchahnulth depends on the person of the
subject, which is the entity on X-side of the semantic equational schema. If it is first or second
person, the predicative form of the appropriate independent pronoun intervenes as predicate head,
and the entity on the Y-side of the equational schema is simply syntactically apposed to it:56

1sg.PRED=INDIC=1sgpriest=ART‘I am the priest.’
The literal force of this construction appears to be ‘I am I (who am) Niinispatwas’, with the name
or RP-with-article as an “appositional complement” to the predicate. This is supported by the fact
that the very same construction translates as ‘It it I, NAME’.

If the subject is third person, the deictic pronoun FtG ‘this one, that one, so-and-so, such-andsuch’ fills the syntactic predicate head slot with the X as its subject and the Y as antecedent to
FtG. The construction literally means something like ‘He is so-and-so (who is) Bill’ or ‘Bill is
that one (who is) the priest’. Note in (216)c that the Y has been moved before the predicate head,
while in (216)d it is the X that has been fronted.

*‘pack-basket (that is) in sth’‘pack-basket (that is) in a container’

The base, which is here only a noun root, provides more precise specification of the meaning of
the suffix –– it fills out or completes its meaning just as the object NP does for the English preposition.
The word in (275)b demonstrates an entirely different grammatical relationship between suffix and base. Unlike ,Ch, the suffix ,BT ‘in a container’ does not determine the class of the resultant word, which remains a noun; it adds information about the base and limits or restricts its denotation, much as an adjective or relative clause limits the denotation of an English noun: the
word’s potential referent is not only a pack-basket, but a pack-basket that is in a container. The
noun p`FTbBt ‘pack-basket in a container’ functions like any other noun. Example (277) shows
it as nominal predicate head in a main clause:

b. ‘The sack has a pack-basket in it.’
c. ‘He/she/they have a pack-basket in the sack.’
The source of the multiple meanings is described in §4.4.3.2. If the predicate is atransitive
(§4.4.3.1), the clause has the existential reading in (277)a, and the RP mHr@jFh ‘the sack’ is a182locative oblique expanding the reference of ,BT. If the subject is personal, the sentence can mean
either (277)b or (277)c depending on the subject reference: if mHr@jFh is interpreted as the subject, (277)b is the appropriate translation; if it is interpreted as an oblique locative, (277)c is the
appropriate translation. The word might also occur as predicate head in a referring phrase (RP):

referring phrase‘I could not find [the sack with a pack-basket in it].’
This use is related to the possessive-existential meaning in (277)b. The RP literally means something like ‘the sack having a pack-basket in it’.
I refer to suffixes of the ,Ch type as nuclear suffixes. Suffixes like ,BT are restrictive suffixes.77 The essential difference between the nuclear and restrictive types is that a nuclear suffix
determines the class of the resultant word, while a restrictive suffix simply modifies the meaning
of its base without fundamentally altering its semantic category or word class. This can be also
expressed in terms of headedness: a nuclear suffix becomes the head of the resultant word, while
the base remains the head when a restrictive suffix is added.78 There are also the morphological
differences between the two types described in §5.1.
The Nuuchahnulth examples in (279) (from Swadesh 1948b: 62) provide further illustration
of the nuclear/restrictive distinction. Compare the word class and denotation of the words in
(279)a and (279)c with that of the word in (279)b.

The underived word in (279)a, E`o`b ‘canoe’, and the derived word with the restrictive suffix in

changed the word class or reference of the resultant word. Addition of the verbalizing suffix
-(x)tF`K ‘perceive ... (perf.)’ in (279)b, on the other hand, changes the category from noun to
verb, and fundamentally alters the relation of subject to predicate.
Boas’s (1947: 237) objection to this classification scheme runs as follows. (The original
quote is rather oddly phrased. I have taken the liberty of including Nakayama’s 1997a: 49 clarificatory emendations in brackets):
We cannot accept the classification of “formative” suffixes in two groups: “governing” and “restrictive” suffixes which are not based on internal evidence, but
rather on our European classifications ... For instance [the morphological complex] “to see a canoe” which [includes a lexical suffix expressing the notion of
“to see” that] would fall under the heading of “governing suffixes” may as well
be conceived as “to perform an action relating to a canoe by seeing” in which
case [the lexical suffix expressing] “to see” would be a restrictive element ... It is
impossible to decide how these combinations may be felt by native speakers.
Formally the governing and restrictive groups are identical.
His point concerning Eurocentric approaches to grammar is well taken, as I have said. In this case
though, contra Boas, the nuclear/restriction distinction is not a product of “European classifications”. The distinction is real and fundamental to Nuuchahnulth word formation. We see better184why his charge is unwarranted if we break it down into three subparts and address them individually. Each makes a slightly differently claim:
1. There is no language internal evidence for the distinction;
2. There is no formal evidence of the distinction;
3. Classifications of individual suffixes as governing [nuclear] or restrictive are artifacts of
translation, as purportedly shown by the ‘see a canoe’ example.
All three of these points can be shown to be false.
The first and second claims are contradicted by patterns like those I presented above, which
show systematic differences in the grammatical and semantic relationships between the two types
of suffixes and their bases. These are certainly language internal and formal (since determination
of word class is based on distributional evidence) –– nuclear suffixes have the power to determine
the class of the resultant word, while restrictive suffixes normally do not. Chapter 8 discusses the
criteria for defining word classes.
As for the third claim, Boas fails to show that the distinction is an artifact of translation because the revised translation of ‘see a canoe’ he proposes to demonstrate this is nothing more than
a convoluted restatement of the original translation. His revision still contains a verb phrase,
namely ‘to perform an action relating to ... by seeing’. Hence, the suffix with this translation
would still produce a verb rather than a noun, which is precisely what is predicted. Further, the
fact that ‘see’ is restrictive in the new translation is irrelevant since it does not modify the right
word. If the suffix were restrictive in the present sense, it would modify the base ‘canoe’ and produce a noun denoting something about a canoe that sees or is seen. Instead, the phrase ‘by seeing’
is an adverbial phrase that modifies the participle construction ‘relating to ...’, which itself modifies the word ‘action’ in the verb phrase ‘perform an action’. As Swadesh (1948b: 62) himself
points out:185Boas says that ‘to see a canoe’ ... may as well be conceived as ‘to perform an action relating to a canoe by seeing.’ But, since the stem alone means ‘canoe,’ this
translation includes for the meaning of the suffix ‘by seeing to perform an action
relating to’ –– which leaves the problem exactly as before ... It is no mere trick of
English translation but an inescapable fact that the relation of subject and stem
remains the same in [(279)a and (279)c] but is radically changed in [(279)b].
Ironically, Boas’ pessimism about gaining insight into native classification leads him to a
wholly translation-based descriptive categorization of suffixes in Kwakwala that is not so far
from the structurally-based scheme adopted for Southern Wakashan in this dissertation (see especially Boas 1947: 237-46). He divides Kwakwala suffixes into 19 categories (some of which contain only one or two suffixes) with labels like “general locatives”, “special locatives”, “nominal
suffixes”, “verbal suffixes”, etc. Based on examples of suffixes he offers from various categories,
it seems likely that at least the locative suffixes and nominal/verbal suffixes (and perhaps suffixes
of the other classes) fall into behaviorally distinguishable super categories comparable to the
Southern Wakashan restrictive and nuclear classes.
I present a provisional summary classification of the various Southern Wakashan nuclear and
restrictive subcategories below. Complete suffix lists can be found in Appendix A. For the most
part these categories have distinct formal properties, which provides some justification for claiming they are reflective of native classification. However, the semantic subdivision of restrictive
locative suffixes in Appendix A (after Rose 1981: 359-61) is simply a convenience to show the
reader the range of meanings expressed by them and is not based on language-internal or formal
criteria.
The proposed classification is not intended as a Procrustean scheme into which all suffixes
must neatly fit. Some fall into more than one category. For example, a handful of suffixes are
sometimes used as restrictive locative suffixes and other times as nuclear verbalizing suffixes
(e.g. N ,bHK ‘(restrictive) on the edge; (nuclear verbalizing) on the ... edge’). These are generally
listed only once in Appendix A, under the category that seems most characteristic.","[196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"

4.6.2Complement constructionsComplement clauses fill a (semantic) argument slot of a higher complement-taking (CT) predicate head. It is unclear whether complement clauses have grammatical relations with matrix
predicate heads (i.e. function as subjects or objects) as well, or are simply oblique constituents of
some sort. Southern Wakashan has both bare absolute and mood-marked complement clauses.
The essential structural difference between a complement construction and an adverbial construction is that, in the former construction, the roles of the two clauses are not permutable, while,
in the latter construction, they are. That is, only (245)a is grammatical; the complement-taking
word vhj,, vhjH ‘not’ must be the initial, subject-marked, predicate head:

(Note that (246)a is the unmarked construction; the variant in (246)b adds emphasis to the identity of the instrument: ‘I chopped it with my axe’.)1554.6.2.1Bare absolute complementsA bare absolute complement clause always follows the matrix clause. An expressed RP subject
can either precede or follow the complement predicate. The subject of the complement predicate
must be co-referential to that of the matrix.

Ftxh, in origin a derived word meaning ‘at so-and-so time’ but now essentially grammaticalized
(in this construction, at least) as a temporal-conditional complementizer. Makah does not have
F`mh. It is not known whether the Makah analogue of the Nuuchahnulth temporal-conditional

5.1 Formal structure
According to a traditional morphological classification of languages,67 Southern Wakashan is a
classic example of a language family with polysynthetic word structure. Though definitions vary,
a major criterion for polysynthetic status in most accounts is a high average number of morphemes per word. An important corollary is that a significant portion of these must be “lexical”,
rather than grammatical in nature; that is, they should have meanings typically expressed by independent lexical items in other languages. These morphemes might include incorporated nouns
and adverbs, or semantically rich affixes like locative suffixes. Such features permit polysynthetic
languages to have words with complex internal structure that often correspond semantically to
entire sentences in less morphologically elaborate languages.68 True to type, words in Southern
Wakashan can be internally complex with numerous morphemes and multiple hierarchic levels of
structure packed into a single derivative.69
Southern Wakashan word structure can be described by the diagram in Figure 2, a more
detailed version of Figure 1 given previously in Chapter 4.70 The major structural division falls
between the unextended word (base + suffixes) and the extended word level (unextended word +
clitics). Important formal differences exist between the two. The sequence of clitics has templatelike organization with a fixed number of slots, flat structure, strict requirements on linear order of

in principle to the number of suffixes that can be added to a base, and the order of suffixes can
often be changed to produce changes in meaning, as demonstrated by the following example set
from Swadesh (1939: 86):
(254)NUUCHAHNULTHa. QtXHrbjih
QtrÊ""HrÊbjiH
herring–consume–remains.of‘left-overs from eating herring’
(254) b. QtrbjihYhr
QtrÊbjihÊpÊ""Hr
herring–remains.of–BFR–consume‘eating left-overs of herring’
This open-ended “stacking” of suffixes creates layered structure rather than flat, slot-based structure with a fixed number of affix positions. The remainder of this section describes these formal
aspects of unextended word structure further. Use of clitics has been briefly described in §4.3 and
is more fully covered in Chapter 7.
An unextended word is formed by a base plus (core) lexical suffixes plus aspectual morphemes. (Expanded unextended words and the core/peripheral suffix distinction are discussed
below.) Words can have aspectual value with no overt aspectual formative if their final morpheme (root or lexical suffix) has inherent aspectual force. Anticipating more detailed discussion
of suffix types in §5.3, we find two basic types of lexical suffix: nuclear suffixes (nominalizing,
verbalizing suffixes, etc.), which determine the word class of the resultant word (§5.4), and restrictive suffixes, which merely modify the meaning of the base without necessarily altering its
word class (§5.5). From these definitions we derive two principles of Southern Wakashan word
formation:
i. The category of a nuclear suffix becomes the category of the resultant word.71
ii. Restrictive suffixes do not necessarily determine the category of the resultant word.","[170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177]"
"Finally, there is an obvious difference in denotation between lexical suffixes and clitics. As
we have seen, suffixes often have semantic content akin to that of independent lexical items, or
even phrases, in English, e.g. M ,(ji)h9K [L+S] ‘making ...’, ,hctW ‘looking for ...’, -`chK [L] ‘on
the neck’. The meanings of clitics (e.g. tense, mood) are much more abstract by comparison, and
clearly mark them as belonging to the grammatical, rather than the lexical level, of the language.
Before turning to more detailed discussion of individual clitics, let us remind ourselves of
their general character. Syntactically, clitics are most associated with the predicate, which was
defined in §4.3 as an obligatory predicate head (normally a single word, but sometimes a complex
of property + noun, numeral + noun, etc.) and one or two optional predicate modifiers. Based on254their typical positions in this predicate structure, three types of clitics can be distinguished
(§4.3.4): 1) second-position clitics, which attach to the first word of the predicate, whether head
or modifier, 2) head clitics, which attach at least to the head, and 3) flexibly-positioned clitics.
The Nuuchahnulth sentence in (367) shows exemplars of each category. The second-position
tense, mood, and pronominal subject clitics are hosted by the initial predicate modifier; the passive-inverse and possessive head clitics are hosted by the predicate head EHKr@o ‘cause to escape, run away’; and the flexibly-positioned temporal specifer <""`Q is hosted by both.

However, rightward copying of second-position clitics is sometimes possible and leftward copying of head clitics is common. In (368)a, the subject clitic has been copied from the initial modifier onto the following head, and in (368)b, the passive-inverse has been copied onto the initial
modifier from the following head:

Another situation in which head clitics are copied leftward involves the passive-inverse, which is
often copied from the head of a lower bare absolute complement head onto the head of the higher
matrix predicate (§4.6.2.1):255(369)NUUCHAHNULTHavhJ`s

It has been suggested by some (e.g. Klokeid 1976, Renker 1987) that clitics in Ditidaht and
Makah (and, by extension, Nuuchahnulth) form a second-position AUX constituent. I find examples like (367)-(369) to be evidence against this analysis, since the clitics do not appear to form a
single block or constituent in sentence structure, nor do they all automatically attach to the first
word of the predicate (or sentence).","[269, 270, 271]"
"92 Segmental Phonology and Accent
This chapter and the next describe aspects of Southern Wakashan phonology. I have organized
the discussion according to two of the three basic tasks of phonological description (cf.
Kenstowicz 1994: 57). Thus, the present chapter is concerned with the inventory of consonant
and vowel phonemes in Nuuchahnulth. It also touches on ablaut patterns (patterns of functionally
significant changes in vowel quality and quantity) and the accent system. Chapter 3 then describes the most important automatic and non-automatic (morpheme-specific) phonological alternations in Nuuchahnulth. Unfortunately, time has not permitted much discussion of phonotactics,
that is, the patterns of the distribution of phonemes in the various units of phonological structure
(see, however, §2.3), but other authors have made references to the subject, e.g. Sapir (1911a,
1933, 1938), Jacobsen (1969a), Haas (1972), Stonham (1994a), inter alia. Rose (1981: 29-31)
provides basic information on phonotactics and morpheme structure in Kyuquot dialect. A brief
discussion of Makah phonology is provided in §0.","[24, 25]"
"78Southern Wakashan languages have no underlying diphthongs. On the surface, however,
there are environments in Makah in which they appear (§3.4.3).
3.4.2Glottalization and lenitionJacobsen (1996) describes glottalization in Makah. The facts, summarized in Table 10, are similar
to those described for Nuuchahnulth in §§3.3.2: stops are glottalized and most fricatives are
changed to glides. Makah, however, shows some distinct developments. First, the change of fricatives to glides is accompanied by lengthening of immediately preceding vowels. For example, the
final /r/ of vhPhr ‘dirty’ in (129) is changed to /x/ by the glottalizing suffix ,""`jQh ‘at the end,
rear’. The /h/ preceding the new glide is lengthened to /H/. (The loss of the final vowel of the suffix is explained in §3.4.3.)
(129)vhPHx`jQ
vhPhr,""`jQh
dirty-at.end‘dirty end’
Preceding length is indicated in Table 10 by ‘9’ before the resulting sonorant. This concomitant
lengthening is the result of the historical loss of glottalized sonorants and accompanying compensatory lengthening of preceding vowels mentioned in §3.4.1.
Second, a small group of bound roots with final /o/ or /s/ have this segment voiced rather than
glottalized when followed by a glottalizing suffix, e.g. when followed by /R/, the final segment of
j`U, ‘kneel’ surfaces as /s/ (130)a, but when followed by a glottalizing suffix, the segment becomes /c/ (130)b:

Note also the concomitant lengthening of the preceding vowel. Preceding a vowel, the segment
appears as /o/ or /s/.
(131)Jihs@
JihUÊ(x)@
stuck.on–CONT‘stuck on’
Following Jacobsen (1996), such segments are marked by the diacritic ‘u’ or ‘U’, e.g. j`U,
‘kneel’, Ehu, ‘plug, jam in’. Most of these roots are cognate with Nuuchahnulth roots with final
nasals (§3.3.5). Similarly, a few roots ending in /K/ change this to /k/ with concomitant lengthening
of the preceding vowel before glottalizing suffixes: a`K.k, ‘cold’ + -""`Wr ‘in a vessel’ > a@k`Wr
‘cold water’.38 These changes also occur before leniting suffixes, but without lengthening.
Glottalizing clitics in Makah have almost identical effects to glottalizing clitics in Nuuchahnulth (§3.3.2) except that no glottal stop is inserted following fricatives:
(132)MAKAHa.c`FTpr`Q

(132)NUUCHAHNULTHb. m`FTprF`Q
m`FTÊpr<""`Q
accompany–in.vessel=TEMPid.
Appearance of a glottal stop from a glottalizing clitic following a fricative in this context thus
indicates that a vowel is present underlyingly that has deleted due to syncope (§3.4.3). For example, the word c`FTprF`Q ‘accompany in a vessel’ in (133) adds the perfective aspect suffix ,hQ81to (132)a. The final /Q/ of the perfective suffix deletes as described in §3.3.7 leaving a /hF`/ sequence that undergoes syncope.
(133)MAKAHc`FTprF`Q
c`FTÊprÊhQ<""`Q

The effects of leniting suffixes are laid out in Table 11. Examples are mostly from Jacobsen
(1996). In addition to the three leniting suffixes found in Nuuchahnulth (,#hK ‘in the house’, ,#hr
‘on the beach’, ,#`ChQ perfective inceptive aspect), Makah has a fourth leniting suffix, the suffix
,#t, a formative suffix that appears with two noun roots referring to kinds of berries, bhjxdR,,
bhjxdxt ‘elderberries’; p`jv`R,, p`jvdxt ‘salmonberries’.39

clitic <?hRC, and the second and third person Indicative mood clitics, e.g. <?h third person singular Indicative. Mutating clitics show either glottalizing or leniting effects depending on the preceding segment. They have no effect on preceding fricatives, but change /o/ and /s/ to /a/ and /c/82respectively, /Q/ to /k/, and glottalize other voiceless stops, except /ji/ and sometimes /j/, which
become /v/.

the patterns of vowel insertion and loss in Makah described by Jacobsen (1971). Very briefly,
these are as follows.
Epenthesis
Makah has a phonotactic constraint against a voiced or glottalized consonant (including glottal
stop) in the the onset of the second syllable when the coda of the first syllable is filled. An impermissable cluster that arises during derivation is broken up by the insertion of a long copy of
the first syllable vowel between the coda consonant of the first syllable and the following onset
consonant, which is the voiced or glottalized segment, of the second syllable:
(136)a. B`p@ahr
B`pÊ@Êahr
bark–EPEN–collectivity.of‘tree bark’
b. phsHchs
phsÊHÊchs
bass–EPEN–stocked.with‘Bass-Stocked (place name)’
c. BtrTx`j
BtrÊTÊx`ji
dig–EPEN–thing.for‘shovel’
d. IhWHBhsp`j
IhWÊHÊBhspÊ`ji
red–EPEN–colored–DUR‘reddish colored’
Epenthesis can separate the consonants of a morpheme, as in (137)a, where the glottalization of
the final consonant of PhQC, ‘dog’ by ,""`Wr ‘in a vessel’ creates the banned cluster /QE/, or
(137)b-c, where the initial clusters of the suffixes ,(j)rF`shFh9 [L] ‘at the door’ and ,(j)rS`K ‘re-84ciprocally’ are broken up when the suffixes attach to a monosyllabic base. The ‘<x>’ notation
indicates that the epenthetic vowel separates the consonants of a morpheme.
(137)a. PhQHE`Wr
PhQCÊ;H=Ê""`Wr
dog–<EPEN>–in.vessel‘a dog in a vessel’
b. B@rpr@F`shFh
B@rpÊ;@=Ê(j)rF`shFh9 [L]
knock–<EPEN>–at.door‘knocking at the door’
c. BtprTS`K
BtpÊ;T=Ê(j)rS`K
punch–<EPEN>–reciprocally‘punching each other, boxing’
In (138), the suffix ,`KB` ‘at, on a vertical surface’ attaches to the root gh,, and the resulting /h`/
sequence reduces to /H/ as described for Nuuchahnulth in §3.2.3: gh,`KB` > gHKB`. This leaves
the impermissable /KB/ cluster, which is then broken up by epenthesis: gHKB` > ghKHB`. (The final
vowel is in turn lost by apocope. See below. The shortening of the initial vowel appears to be a
more or less regular concomitant of epenthesis and may be related to the initial shortening that
accompanies appended vowels, §3.4.4).
(138)ghKHB
ghÊ`KB`
face.located–at.vertical.surface‘have one’s face against the wall’
Clusters with final voiced or glottalized segments are permitted later in the word:
(139)a. IHc`pahr

b. vhPhrBhsp`j
vhPhrÊBhspÊ`ji
dirty–colored–DUR‘dirty colored’85c. ghc`KB
ghc`Ê`KB`
empty.root–at.vertical.surface‘on the wall’
As will be seen below, banned clusters with final glottal stop (e.g. vhjFnK ‘not see, perceive’) can
emerge on the surface due to the operation of a later syncope rule.
Apocope
Word-final short vowels are lost under most conditions. [RepR] in (140)b indicates reduplication
occurring as part of repetitive aspect formation (§6.5.4):
(140)a. g`Fta
g`Fta`
food‘food’

close.teeth–PERF=IMPER.2sg‘Bite him/her/it!’
e. E@FTpihK
E@FTpihK<?h
drunk=INDIC.3sg‘He/she is drunk.’
A related rule concerns the length of long vowels in word-final position. Regular long vowels
are shortened and optionally lost (141)a; persistently long vowels are merely shortened (141)b:86(141)a. ghs`Bt or ghs`B
ghs`ÊBT
empty.root–in.container‘in a container’
b. Ihbtwi`ch
Ihbtwi`ch9
person‘person, Indian’
This shortening is only quantitative, that is, the basic tense quality of the vowel is unchanged. For
example, a long /H/ shortened in final position is always pronounced [i], never [ι]. In very careful
citation speech, shortening is sometimes hardly evident. It is not clear whether accented vowels
shorten.41 Pending further research, words like ptKT ‘slave’ will be written with long vowels.
Makah has no underlying diphthongs. Due to apocope, however, they can arise on the surface. The loss of a short vowel from a word-final vowel-glide-vowel sequence (e.g. /... `v`#/)
leaves a diphthong. Vowel-loss after /x/ leaves a diphthong with a [y] offglide; vowel-loss after
/v/ leaves a diphthong with a [w] offglide. The following examples show long and short /`/ before /x/ and /v/.
(142)a. bhjxdx [srHjgxdy]
bhjxdxt
elderberry‘elderberry’
b. s`jx@x [s¿jgx`9y]
s`jx@xt

c. P`S`v [P¿S`w]
P`S`v`
beaver‘beaver’
d. c@K@v [c`9K`9w]42
c@K@vh
awesome.sight‘(a) strange, awesome sight’87Syncope
VFV sequences in which both vowels are short are often subject to syncope: V0FV2 → FV2. The
rules for syncope are complex and not yet fully understood, but the following words give some
idea of their effects. See Jacobsen (1971: 15-17) for further discussion and examples.43 Example
(143)b shows that syncope must operate after vowel shortening (§3.1) because otherwise this
vowel would surface long, being in the second syllable.
(143)a. W@aF`j
W@a`ÊF`ji
stay.overnight–DUR‘staying overnight’
b. a`pFhjr
a`phÊ""Hjr
what–consume‘consuming what?’
Assimilation or partial assimilation sometimes takes place whereby the second vowel takes on
features of the first vowel before the first vowel deletes. (The final /o/ of the benefactive clitic in
(144)c is lost before glottalizing clitics, which creates the VFV sequence in this word).
(144)a. E`EFdr

PL–water–on.beach‘puddles of water here and there on the beach’

not–perceive.PERF‘not perceive’
c. rtjihQFtr
rtÊjihQ<to<""hr
hold–PERF=BEN=IMPER.2sg/1sg‘Get it for me!’88Syncope is another source for surface diphthongs. The application of this rule to a sequence
like /...dxtFh/ leaves a glide in the syllable coda: /...dx$Fh/. Vowel-glide sequences in this circumstance are diphthongized, e.g.

3.4.4Appended vowelsMakah has converted many historically consonant-final monosyllabic free forms into vowel-final
bisyllabic forms by means of an “appended” vowel, a long copy of the first syllable vowel appended to the root to create a second syllable. This effect of this historical process can be seen in
comparison with cognate roots in Nuuchahnulth, which has not developed these vowels.
(146)NMEhsEhsH‘soft, easily torn’YHjiPhjH‘pair of brothers’FhCFhCH‘fat (shellfish)’JiHrJihrH‘snow’QtKQtKT‘good, clean’I`bI`b@‘fat’I`GI`W@‘not crying’ItpItpT‘wide, broad’l@ra`r@‘bake (intr.) on open fire’mTjctjT‘song’p`sp`s@‘hard, brittle’pTKptKT‘slave’89s@Ks`K@‘warm (in time of cold)’sHCshCH‘alive, well’FtGFtWTdeictic pronounvhjvhjH‘not, nothing’x`pix`p@‘one who, that which’As several of the forms show (e.g. N JiHr, M JihrH or N s@K, M s`K@), original long vowels in
the first syllable shorten in Makah as part of this process.44
For evidence against the alternative analysis that the appended vowel has been dropped in
Nuuchahnulth rather than added in Makah we can look to Kwakwala cognates, which agree with
the short Nuuchahnulth forms rather than the appended Makah forms. (Recall from §3.3.9 that
Proto-Wakashan */j/ corresponds to Southern Wakashan /C/):
(147)NM‘good’FhCFhCH‘fat (shell fish)’45I™W ‘stop crying’I`GI`W@‘not crying’Kw
FhjA few roots exceptionally lack the appended vowel, F`p ‘wide’, Ji`K ‘branch’. It is also absent from monosyllabic discourse particles and interjections like Fdc emphatic particle, FhR ‘and’,
vDc ‘hey! (calling for attention)’.
The appended vowel is present before most clitics (148)a-b, but not before <""`Q temporal
specifier, <""h Imperative, and perhaps other glottalizing clitics (148)c-d.

So far we have seen appended vowels only in connection with free roots. However, we also
find them added to some underlyingly monosyllabic derivatives. Comparison with Nuuchahnulth
is again revealing:

a.b.c.d.","[93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]"
"180His worries about imposition of external categories on the object language are clearly wellfounded, and even today this is a common pitfall of comparative semantic research. Lucy (1994:
624) describes such research as follows:
Lexical items are grouped together [in analyses of this sort] and analyzed as a
coherent set not because speakers of those languages group them together in a set
as revealed, for example, by common grammatical treatment, but because the
analyst so groups them. And meanings are assigned not on the basis of close examination of actual usage, but on the basis of rough functional equivalence with
forms in our own language. Thus an external framework is imposed on the language in place of a framework deriving from its native logic.
Conclusions from these studies are likely to reveal more about the external framework than about
the language under analysis.
Fortunately, we need not content ourselves with a classification of lexical suffixes in Southern Wakashan that is descriptively useful, but ultimately of little value in understanding how the
languages works. We can make use of language internal criteria, both semantic and formal, to
classify the suffixes following “native logic”. Given the importance of the suffixes in the grammar, this is, in fact, an essential task. As we know, however, “all grammars leak”, so there is no
reason to expect every suffix to fit neatly into our classification scheme, whether its logic is native or external. By and large, suffixes do fall fairly clearly into one category or another, but a
few belong to more than one category, and we are left with the inevitable residue of suffixes that
are difficult to classify.
Use of language internal criteria can be demonstrated by considering the status of two ostensibly similar Nuuchahnulth suffixes, ,Ch ‘at, in ...’ and ,BT ‘in a container’. At first glance, one
might think to group these together as “locative” suffixes. However, closer study of their semantic relationship with bases and their effect on the grammatical category of the resultant word
shows that, according to Nootkan logic, they actually belong to different categories. Consider
(275), which shows each suffix with the simple noun root p`FTb ‘pack-basket’ as base.","[195, 196]"
"5.4 Nuclear suffixes
5.4.1Verbalizing suffixesVerbalizing suffixes fall into roughly two groups, one creating verbs expressing actions or activities undertaken by their S/A argument, and the other creating verbs expressing a state, quality, or
condition, defined, as Swadesh (1933: 65) says, “with the aid of the underlying [base]”. We refer
to these types as verbalizing “action” and verbalizing “state” suffixes, respectively.79
Verbalizing action suffixes generally denote more abstract or superordinate types of actions
than verb roots. For instance, some verbalizing action suffixes denote a generalized type of action
like ‘consume’, whereas verb roots in the same semantic domain express a specific subtype of
that action like ‘eat’ and ‘drink’. Consider these Nuuchahnulth examples:187(280)NUUCHAHNULTHSuffix – action hypernymRoot – action hyponym,""Hr ‘consuming ...’g`V`, ‘eat’
m`p, ‘drink’,(x)tF`K ‘perceive ... (perf.)’M`C, ‘look, see’
m`F@ ‘hear, understand, perceive’,b`, ‘go to ...’x`b, ‘walk, step, go’
j`lhspi, ‘run’
l`s, ‘fly’
rtr, ‘swim’,@s` ‘directing action, blows at ...’ghr-, ‘hit with beating instrument’
Itoj, ‘hit with beak, peck’
I`oG, ‘slam broad object against’
Btpi, ‘punch’
Btwi, ‘stab’Eating and drinking are kinds of consuming, or, put differently, specific manners of action that
effect the more general action of consuming. In the same way, seeing and hearing are ways of
perceiving, and hitting, slapping, pecking, punching, etc. are all ways of directing blows. Even in
cases where translations do not make the contrast apparent, there are usually subtle differences in
usage between roots and suffixes with similar meanings, e.g. the free verb root N mtmTj, M
ctcTj ‘singing’ denotes the activity of singing per se, while the suffix N ,hx`pG, M ,dx`W [R]
‘singing ... song’ denotes the performance of a particular song denoted by the base. See §4.6.1.1
for examples of how these general-action verbalizing suffixes are used in conjunction with manner roots in discourse.
Despite the tendency of verbalizing action suffixes to denote more generalized types of action, there is also a set of verbalizing suffixes with surprisingly specific meanings relating to ritual or ceremonial activities, e.g. N ,""`XhlC ‘doing ritual for ... weather’, N ,F@l`C [L] ‘signifying, auguring, casting a spell for ...’, N -rhlC, M ,rta`C [L] ‘doing ritual for ...’, N ,b`vhmxtj
[L] ‘doing (esp. give a potlatch) on account of, in honor of ...’, N ,-""hmK, M ,-""hchK [L] ‘giving a
feast of ...’, N ,rHGFh9 ‘go to ... on a gift visit’, N -St9K` [L] ‘giving a potlatch or ceremony in
honor of ...’. Sapir (1912, reprint 1949: 99-100, 1916, reprint 1949: 444) famously cites the exis-188tence of such suffixes as evidence for the importance and antiquity of these ritual activities, particularly those having to do with the potlatch, in Nootkan culture.

"34Some neutralizing environments favor non-labialized consonants, others favor labialized consonants. A segment that occurs in a proscribed environment is replaced by its homorganic labialized

We would expect *FhmjiFh given the condition listed in (28), which permits labialized consonants

time, precedes a consonant that would otherwise prevent labialization (Environment 1), a rounded
vowel (Environment 2), or a word boundary (Environment 3), labialization is optional. The texts
that form the main body of our corpus are not a reliable guide here, since, as Jacobsen (1969b)
points out, the orthography in Sapir & Swadesh (1939, 1955) is phonemically rather than phonetically significant with regard to this data. Thus, in these two volumes we find only transcriptions with non-labialized consonants in these environments, e.g.","[49, 50, 51]"
"6.2 The character of aspect in Southern Wakashan
At least from Sapir (1924), researchers on Southern Wakashan have recognized a basic two-way
semantic aspectual distinction. As we will see below, I claim with Rose (1981) that the distinction
is between imperfective and perfective aspect, but the two categories were originally labeled
“durative” and “momentaneous” by Sapir and Swadesh in Nuuchahnulth. This analysis is explicitly stated in places,87 but, even where not claimed outright in their works, it is often implied.88
Swadesh & Swadesh (1933: 199) give a representative characterization of the meanings of the
durative and momentaneous categories (as originally conceived) in Ditidaht:89
The durative expresses a continued existence, state, or activity; thus duratives are
translatable by English nouns, adjectives, and verbs expressing states and continued activities. The momentaneous expresses momentary occurrences, including
transitions into states and states of activity (these are generally translated “to start
doing ...”).
They evidently see the aspectual distinction as deriving from the duration of the situation itself: a
situation that lasts a relatively long time (“a continued existence, state, or activity”) is expressed
by the durative, and, conversely, a situation that lasts a very short time (a “momentary occurrence”) is expressed by the momentaneous. An aspectual distinction of this type is a situationtype distinction, because it involves some feature of the intrinsic temporal structure of the situation as represented by the semantics of the language. Different situation-type aspects correspond
to different semantic situation types.
A problem arises immediately with a situation-type definition of the two aspects based on
duration: the “momentaneous” is not limited to expressing momentary situations. It does express219situations that are truly instantaneous, as the suffix M, N ,RhQ in (323)a does, but it can just as
easily refer to a situation that might last minutes (323)b or days (323)c.

daughter’s puberty potlatch)
It is difficult to see how the duration of the situations could be the primary factor in the choice of
aspect in these examples.
On the contrary, the point of using ,RhQ in (323) is not to express some intrinsic characteristic
of the situations (like momentary duration), but to present a particular view of them relative to
other situations in the flow of discourse, whatever their intrinsic structure might be. This is “extrinsic” or viewpoint (Smith 1996) aspect, a “temporal restriction on what is asserted” (Klein
1995: 690).90 Here the basic distinction is between perfective and imperfective aspects. Following
the spirit (though not necessarily the letter) of Klein’s (1995) “time-relational” analysis of aspect,
the difference between perfective and imperfective can be thought of as a difference in the scope
of assertion relative to internal situation boundaries. As I interpret this with respect to Southern
Wakashan, viewpoint aspect does not express durativity or lack thereof (as situation-type aspect
would), but rather, by selection of one (viewpoint) aspect over another, a speaker elects to include
or exclude any phases or boundaries that already exist in the meaning of a base. For example, in220(323)c, by choosing ,RhQ, which we now reinterpret as a perfective suffix, the speaker includes all
phases of the situation in his assertion, and thus in effect presents it as a completed whole relative
to other situations in the discourse context. The following Nuuchahnulth text excerpt (from Text
39) shows example (323)c in situ, with its immediately preceding and following sentences.

The three situations are presented as temporally sequenced, independent, and completed events,
like beads on a string:
[event 1] ‘they said’ [event 2] ‘I went home’ [event 3] ‘I arrived’
On the other hand, when an imperfective aspect is applied to v`K-,, all internal situation
boundaries are not included in the assertion, allowing the situation of going home to be interpreted as ongoing and overlapping another situation. Example (324) has v`K-, with the
graduative imperfective aspect (§6.5.1), an aspect used for secondary imperfectivization (i.e. to
imperfectivize an already perfective form), as a bare absolute predicate head following the inherently imperfective sHC ‘alive’. Because, as imperfectives, neither (v@KRhQ or sHC) has its situation boundaries included in the assertion, they can be construed as simultaneous.","[234, 235, 236]"
"2.3 Coda nasals and post-nasal murmur-vowels
Nasal consonants in syllable codas are pronounced with a schwa-like murmur-vowel release
(Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 13), e.g. bhjhlhm ‘iron’ [srιjιlιm5], Chlr [sRιl5r] ‘black bear’,
gtmprhlC [gtm5pgrιl5sR] ‘do a ritual to catch drift-whales’, Fhmji [Fιm5jg] ‘fire’.7 Sapir described the sound of this post-nasal release vowel in several passages over the course of his writings on the language. In one early work he called it a “short open i-vowel of rather unclear quality” (1915, reprint 1949: 196). Later, he referred to it variously as a “murmured i-vowel” (1924:
84, note 9), a “murmured vowel of i-timbre” (1933, reprint 1949: 57), a “light i-murmur release”16(1938, reprint 1949: 235), and (with Swadesh) a “voiced murmur-vowel release” (Sapir &
Swadesh 1939: 13). My characterization of it as schwa follows Rose (1981: 21).
The status of these murmured schwas as mere phonetic concomitants to coda nasals may imply that they are phonologically inert, but this is only partially accurate. It is true that they are
invisible for purposes of syllable counting (and hence not represented in the current orthography8), e.g. Fhmji ‘fire’ is monosyllabic, as the behavior of attached suffixes with long vowels
(§3.1) shows: the vowel in the locative suffix ,@r ‘on a horizontal surface’ is long if the suffix
falls in the first or second syllable of a word (e.g. bhj,@r ‘aslant on it’), but, in third or later syllables, it is short (e.g. r`l`K,`r ‘crawling around on it’). In Fhmji,@r ‘fire on it’, the vowel is
long, proving Fhmji is monosyllabic. However, murmur-vowels do count as vowels for “linear”
phonological processes –– suffixes that directly follow murmur-vowels take post-vocalic forms.
For example, certain suffixes have an initial consonant that is lost following consonant-final
bases, but retained following vowel-final bases, including bases with final coda nasals and murmur-vowels (§3.3.8). The locative suffix -(b)r`9S` [L] ‘on the forehead’ is one such suffix.9 The
bracketed initial consonant is lost following the consonant-final base vhj ‘not, nothing’ in (4)a,
but retained following the vowel-final base j`, ‘stick-like object protruding’ in (4)b. (4)c shows
that the initial consonant is also retained following the coda nasal and its murmur-vowel.

Leniting suffixes (§3.3.3) provide another example. These suffixes, symbolized by ,#, have no
effect following stop consonants (5)a, but following vowels (5)b or coda nasals with murmurvowels (5)c, they require insertion of a glottal stop:

For a third example, the possessive clitic takes the form <tj when following consonant-final
bases (6)a, but <F`j following vowel-final bases (6)b. Bases ending with coda nasals and murmur-vowels are again treated as vowel-final bases (6)c:

Syllables containing coda nasals pattern with syllables containing long vowels with respect to
a morpheme-specific process of vowel lengthening (§3.3.1). Some suffixes require phonological
alterations to the first syllable of their base such as initial CV reduplication or vowel lengthening.
If the first syllable vowel is already long, it is not affected –– there are no overlong vowels. Compare the effect a suffix of this type has on bases with underlying short and long vowels (7)a-b
with its effect on a base with an underlying coda nasal in the first syllable (7)c.

Neither the underlying long vowel in (7)b nor the syllable with the coda nasal in (7)c are affected
by the suffix-induced length. However, the underlying short vowel in vhj ‘not’ in (7)a is lengthened to vHj.
Post-nasal murmur-vowels are in origin reductions of original full vowels, either through historical change or through synchronic alternation. To begin with the historical, compare the Makah
and Nuuchahnulth forms in (8). For present purposes, the Makah forms are assumed to represent19the original Proto-Southern-Wakashan vowels. (Note that Nuuchahnulth nasals /l L m M/, reflexes of original PSW nasals, correspond to voiced stops /a c/ in Makah; here it is Nuuchahnulth
that is more conservative).

three related changes in the history of Nuuchahnulth: 1) the reduction of original PSW full postnasal vowels (retained in Makah) in vowel-nasal-vowel sequences to murmured non-nuclear
(weightless) schwas; 2) incorporation of the now stranded nasals (along with any following consonants not immediately followed by a vowel) into the coda of the preceding syllable, followed
by 3) “thinning” of the original pre-nasal vowels to /i/, apparently an assimilatory reaction to the20development of the murmur-vowel (Sapir 1933, reprint 1949: 57, footnote 19). Sapir (1924: 84,
note 9), for example, posits )F`m,`j as etymon of Fhmji, a reconstruction clearly supported by
the modern Makah form F`c@ji. (The source of the long vowel in Makah is unclear; it does not
affect the point at hand). Thus, assuming a PSW form for ‘fire’ like that proposed by Sapir, we
surmise the following sequence of changes leading to the modern Nuuchahnulth reflex:
(9)F`-m`jinitial form (period indicates syllable boundary)F`-mjreduction of post-nasal vowel to non-nuclear murmur-vowelF`mjincorporation of the nasal (and following consonant) into the
coda of the preceding syllableFhmjpre-nasal /`/ thins to /h/Synchronic alternations between reduced and non-reduced post-nasal vowels occur in nasalinitial suffixes. In schematic form, such suffixes have two alternates, -NV(C)... and -N(C)..., e.g.
(10),mtQ, ,mQperfective aspect suffix,MH, ,m‘arrive’,Mhp,, ,mp,‘down a slope’,l`, ,l‘... thing’,l`K,, ,lK,‘moving about’Addition of a nasal-initial suffix to a vowel-final base creates a vowel-nasal-vowel sequence in
which the post-nasal vowel often reduces as outlined in (9). When added to consonant-final bases,
on the other hand, the suffix-initial nasal does not follow a vowel, and the post-nasal vowel cannot reduce. Compare, for example, the shapes of ,Mhp, ‘down a slope’ and ,l`K, ‘moving about’
when affixed to consonant-final bases (11)a, (12)a and vowel-final bases (11)b, (12)b.

Added to a consonant-final base like j`lhspi, ‘run’, ,Mhp, forms a consonant-nasal-vowel sequence, /pMh/ in this case, in which the vowel cannot reduce. But following the empty root ghs`,,
a vowel-nasal-vowel sequence is formed in which the vowel is subject to reduction:

The reduction of post-nasal vowels to murmur-vowels in vowel-nasal-vowel sequences is
widespread in the language, but not completely general. Some morphemes have internal sequences with full post-nasal vowels, e.g. along with the suffix ,rhlC [L] ‘doing ritual for ...’ (M
-rta`C) with its coda nasal and murmur-vowel (14)a, we find the suffix -o`m`C [L] ‘moving
about at random’ (M ,o`c`C) with an always intact vowel-nasal-vowel sequence /`m`/ (14)b.","[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]"
"5.7 Etymological relations between lexical suffixes and roots
Lexical suffixes are at least very rare cross-linguistically and clearly very different semantically
than affixes in familiar languages.83 Despite their root-like meanings, very few show any phonological relationship to a root from which one might hypothesize they are historically derived.
Swadesh (1939: 79) points out two lexical suffixes with both obvious phonological and semantic
similarity to an extant root: the path suffix N ,l`K,, M ,a`K, ‘moving about’ with root N l`K,
‘move’, M a`K`s, ‘(large object) tremble, shake’, and the verbalizing suffix N, M -v@(K) ‘say ...’
with root N, M v@ ‘say’. We might also compare the root N FHpG, ‘tell, narrate’ (probably reduced from earlier *Fhx`pG,) to the verbalizing suffix N ,hx`pG [R] ‘sing ... song’, or, in Kyuquot dialect, ‘tell ... story’ (Rose 1981: 356). A final example involves the primitive root element
N, M vh, that occurs as a component of various roots expressing negative concepts, e.g. N vhj,
M vhjH ‘not’, N vHX`, M vHx` ‘never’, M vHa` ‘not know, recognize a person’, N vhF`ji
‘invulnerable, unafraid’, N, M vH,p, ‘angry, unpleasant; stormy, bad (weather)’, and many others.84 This element evidently occurs as a suffix in a single Nuuchahnulth derivative, rtvHX`j
‘instrument for not holding, nothing to hold’ (< rt, ‘hold’ + ,vH + ,X`ji ‘... instrument’)
(Swadesh 1933: 154). These root/suffix pairs exhaust readily detectable examples. More typical
is the situation shown in (319): roots with semantically similar suffixes are not phonologically
related to them:
(319)RootLexical SuffixN O`OH, M OhOhFH ‘ear’N ,""hlK, M ,""`ahK‘at the ear’N p`rH, M p`khFH ‘eye’N ,(b)rt(K), M ,(j)rhK‘at, in the eye’214N StGBhsh, M StWTBhc` ‘head’ N ,`xtj, M ,dxtj‘at the head, hair’N ,(v)h9ji‘on the head’N ,(b)rhmxtj‘on the head’N ,vhGs`‘at the head’Many body parts are not even coded by roots. If they must be referred to, the corresponding
body-part locative suffix is affixed to a dummy root, either the empty root N ghs`, ghm`, ghm,, M
ghs`, ghc`, or the general locative root N F`l,, M F`u, F`a, e.g.
(320)N F`F`l`r‘(on) the cheeks’ (,`r [R] ‘at the cheeks’)M F`F`a`c`phK ‘(at) the midriff’ (,`c`phK [R] ‘at the midriff’)
N ghm`jrtK‘(at) the mouth, lips’ (,`jrt(K) ‘at the mouth, lips’)M ghs`ptK‘(at) the face’ (,(p)T(K) ‘at the face’)5.8 Specialization
Derived words vary widely in spontaneity of composition and degree of lexicalization. Speakers
are capable of using the principles of derivation we have discussed in this chapter to spontaneously produce and interpret new words, but many derived words must be considered elements of
the permanent mental lexicon, that is, words that are learned as units by speakers during the
course of language acquisition and not derived anew for each use. The clearest indication of this
is specialization of meaning. Derived words frequently have meanings more specific than the
meanings of their component parts would suggest. Examples are legion. The Nuuchahnulth word
FHGsTo (FHGi ‘big’ + ,(R)sTo ‘... species’) literally means ‘big sort, species of thing’ but now
denotes only ‘whale’. The literal force of the component morphemes (‘big’ and ‘... species’) has
been lost, as shown by the fact that one can say ‘big whale’ by modifying the derived word with
one of its own components: FHG FHGsTo ‘a big whale’ (NA 149.47). Similarly, N bhY`r (bhp,
‘speak’ + -""`r ‘go in order to ...’) literally means ‘go in order to speak’, but it is now specialized215to refer to a formal marriage party made up of the groom’s relatives going to the prospective
bride’s people to discuss the proposal in certain ritualized ways. Derived words with specialized
meanings are commonly used for names of flora and fauna, tools, ceremonies, personal names,
and place names, e.g.

Sometimes both the specialized and literal meanings of a word are available. The root N, M
B`, means ‘(to) flow’, but with the durative aspect it is also used for ‘river, stream, creek’. The
two senses are even used together in the same phrase at NA 165.43: B`F`jFh B`F`j ‘the flowing

Comrie (1976: 16-17) argues against equating perfectivity with short duration or momentaneous occurrence in part by citing examples from several languages that show perfective verbs in
construction with temporal expressions that imply duration like ‘for an hour’ and ‘for ten years’,
e.g. Ancient Greek ebasíleuse (perfective past) déka étē ‘he ruled ten years’. A similar argument
can be made in Southern Wakashan, with the difference that the temporal expressions themselves
take the perfective marking; they are complement-taking words that serve as matrix predicate
heads for the temporally modified complement clauses (§4.6.2.1), e.g. pH ‘(do) [COMP] for a
long time’ and lTCHK ‘(do) [COMP] for four days’. The perfective suffix with these expressions
indicates the completion of the time period denoted by the matrix.

Before discussing the functions of each aspectual morpheme in more detail in §§6.4-6.5, a summary of how the different aspects are marked is in order (Table 12). Perfective aspect is inherent
in the meaning of some free roots and lexical suffixes, e.g. M, N v`g@ji ‘go (perf.)’, M, N ,""hQ
[L] ‘get ... (perf.)’, M ,(j)rhKs`, N ,(b)rtGs` ‘come out of the woods (perf.)’. If it is not inherent,

suffix with changes to
vowel length of the baseperfective aspect is marked by the M, N suffix ,RhQ, which has many allomorphs (Table 13). A
handful of free roots and lexical suffixes (e.g. M FhFHWi`, N FHGi ‘big’, N X@p ‘long’) take the
“inceptive” suffix ,#`ChQ instead: X@p`ChQ ‘become long’. However, other roots and lexical suf-223fixes, particularly those with final vowels or (in Nuuchahnulth) coda nasals (§2.3), are marked for
perfective aspect by another suffix, M ,dx`ChQ or ,h9vhQ, N ,h9ChQ, traditionally known in the
literature as the inceptive: M ctCHvhQ ‘turn into a mountain’ (ctChFH ‘mountain’), N
phC`mHChQ ‘become a louse’ (phChm ‘louse’).
Perfective aspect is essentially marked by a single suffix (the inceptive suffixes notwithstanding), but imperfective aspect is indicated in a variety of ways. Most free roots and lexical suffixes
are inherently imperfective and require no special imperfective marking: M phCHc`, N phChm
‘louse’, M, N ,""`r ‘on the ground’, M -hctW, N ,M@G ‘seeking ...’. If a word is already perfective, it can be imperfectivized by the graduative, indicated by the [L+S] CV template (see example (324)).91 The durative suffix ,`ji ,tj added to a bound root indicates a stative intransitive
imperfective aspect: N mhmj`ji ‘wrapped around’ (mhmj, ‘twist, wrap around’); it also occurs
with many bound roots denoting manner of motion: M WHFtj ‘crawling’ (Wh, ‘crawl’). The continuative suffix ,(x)@ or, occasionally, the [L] CV template, with a bound root indicates dynamic
imperfective aspect: verb N mhmj@ ‘getting wrapped around’, verb M, N C`p@ ‘pushing’ (C`p,
‘push, shove’).
In addition to the graduative, durative, and continuative imperfective aspects, which can be
called “uniplex” imperfective aspects, there are two multiplex aspectual formations, the repetitive
and the iterative. These imply various types of iteration of events versus the essentially steadystate meanings of the uniplex aspects. The repetitive, which expresses events repeated at regular
and generally narrow-spaced intervals, is formed by a special reduplication type plus the suffix
-(x)`. As we will see below, the repetitive has expanded its function somewhat beyond this in
Makah to cover semantic space expressed by the continuative in Nuuchahnulth. The iterative,
which expresses irregular iteration, is formed in two ways, one involving reduplication, and the
other involving changes to the perfective form of the base.","[236, 237, 238, 239]"
"356Appendix A: Lexical Suffixes
Lists of Nuuchahnulth and Makah lexical suffixes are presented below. Citation of Nuuchahnulth
suffixes is based on the more-or-less complete list provided by Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 316-34).
When possible, Makah equivalents (not necessarily cognates) to the Nuuchahnulth suffixes are
given as well. Many suffixes listed by Sapir and Swadesh are not well attested, or even unattested, in the Nuuchahnulth corpus; classification of these is obviously subject to revision. A few
suffixes have been posited that are not listed by them, e.g. -b@oh [L] ‘facing ...’ and -(b)bho`jQh
‘at the hams, upper thigh, rump’. Makah suffixes are often attested only in a word or two; their
shapes, morphophonemics, CV template associations, and glosses must be considered provisional, pending discovery or elicitation of more examples. Around 300 Makah suffixes have been
isolated to date; there are certainly many more yet to be found.
Throughout, Nuuchahnulth glosses are based on those given by Sapir and Swadesh, although
in some cases their original gloss has been modified based on corpus examples. This statement
also applies to morphophonemic indications. To save space, only one allomorph of each suffix in
each language is shown, even though many occur in more than one shape. However, it is often
unclear whether two apparently related forms should be considered allomorphs of a single suffix
or two suffixes. For instance, certain suffixes occur (in a phonologically unpredictable fashion) in
some words with the initial formative element N ,(b)r,, M ,(j)r, and in other words without it,
for example N, M -`b ‘vessel for ...’ in N x`Rl`p,`b, M x`R@a`p,`b ‘fur-sealing canoe’ and N
,(b)r`b, M ,(j)r`b ‘container, vessel for ...’ in N, M O`sp,r`b ‘valise’. Decisions as to whether
these pairs are allomorphs of a single suffix or two distinct suffixes have been made on a case-bycase basis. Sometimes the meanings and/or morphophonemic properties of the two forms have
diverged enough to justify considering them separate suffixes. In other cases, they appear to be357
lexically-conditioned allomorphs of a single suffix, and only one form, the form that seems most
characteristic, is listed.
The symbol ‘/’ after a CV template diacritic following a Makah suffix indicates that the template is associated only with the Makah suffix, not with the Nuuchahnulth suffix. An asterisk following a Makah CV template diacritic indicates its association with the suffix was taken from
Jacobsen (1997a) or Jacobsen (1998a).

"2.2 Vowels
Sapir & Swadesh’s (1939: 12–13) analysis of the vowel inventory is shown in Table 3.5 Symbols
are adjusted to reflect current orthographic practice in the Southern Wakashan descriptive literature (see note 6). Approximate phonetic values (inferred from Sapir’s 1924 phonetic transcription
system and Sapir & Swadesh’s 1955: 3-4 pronunciation notes) are as follows:
h[ι]high front unrounded lax, as in Standard American English (SAE) pitH[hı]high front unrounded tense long, as in SAE Petet[T]high back rounded lax, as in SAE put (but see below)T [tı]high back rounded tense long, as in SAE hoot (but see below)`low central unrounded, as in SAE pot[`]@ [`ı]low central unrounded long, as in SAE fatherdmid front lax, as in SAE pet[D]D [dı]mid front tense long, as in SAE paten[å]mid back lax, as in SAE boughtN [åı]mid back lax long, as in SAE dog13Table 3. Nuuchahnulth vowel inventory
FrontCentralBackHighh HT TMidd Dn NLow` @The high back vowels are actually more open than the cardinal value, having the lip rounding of
the vowel in hoot but the height of the vowel in coat (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 13, 1955: 4).6
The mid vowels in Table 3 are phonemically marginal. Although common on the surface (except the short mid back vowel –– see below), most occurrences are secondary, arising from one of
two sources. First, the long mid vowels /D N/ often appear as ablauted variants of the six basic
(i.e. non-mid) vowels /h H t T ` @/ in emphatic vocative and “calling out” forms (§2.4), and also
in some interjections, e.g.
(1)FD (expressing dissatisfaction)
g`mD ‘hey!’
gD (implying that a statement is true in a surprising way or to a surprising degree)
gNVh (expressing willingness and intention of doing as requested)Second, the mid front vowels /d D/ can result from an umlaut rule that raises and fronts /` @/ to
/d D/ preceding /h H/ with only glottal stop intervening, e.g. s`M` ‘child’, s`MdFhr ‘little child’
(§3.2.1).
Since the ablaut variants /D N/ have functional significance, they must be considered phonemic. There are also a very few occurrences of /d D/ in underlying forms of native vocabulary
(not attributable to umlaut) that support their phonemic status. The short mid front vowel appears
underlyingly (and not from umlaut) in a few interjections and a single root in Sapir & Swadesh’s
(1939: 243-316) list of “primary stems”: jdFDbj`s, or j`bjdFd9s, ‘jump on one leg, hop’. The
long front mid vowel also appears in this root as well as in a few personal names (some of which14may not be of Nuuchahnulth origin), e.g. woman’s name CDF`j`l. The short mid back vowel
/n/ seems to occur only as an allophonic variant of /t/ and is therefore probably non-phonemic.
Vowels show more tendency for allophonic variation than the consonants. There is no complete, systematic account of Tseshaht dialect vowel allophony that I am aware of, but the following allophones can be posited from comments in Sapir (1924) and Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 13).
All vowels are characterized by “a breath-release” in word-final position (Sapir 1924: 84,
note 9). It is not heard when the word is pronounced in close proximity to the next word. Thus,
Sapir (1924: 76) transcribes FhmjFH ‘the fire’ as [Fιm5jgFιg] (transcription normalized; for the
aspiration of /j/ see §2.1; for [5] see §2.3).
The pharyngeal consonants condition another set of allophonic vowel processes. These consonants have certain coarticulatory effects on adjacent high vowels. The pharyngeal fricative /G/
is said to have a “voiceless a-timbre [that] colors and lowers following high vowels” (Sapir 1924:
83, note 3). The examples in (2) show two roots with short high vowels preceded by /G/, both in
phonemic representation (in slashes) and Sapir’s phonetic notation (in brackets).
(2)/Ghr,/ [GDr]
/Gtr,/ [Går]‘blood’
‘salt water’These lowered allophones of the high vowels are tenser than the mid-vowel phonemes in Table 3,
ensuring that we are dealing with an allophonic process here rather than a neutralizing one (cf.
Sapir 1924: 85, note 22).
This “coloring” also affects long vowels, creating what Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 13) refer to
as “pseudo-diphthongs”, e.g. the suffix -`rGT(K) ‘at the chest’ is transcribed by Sapir (1924: 87,
note 44) as [`rG`tK]. In word-final position, however, /H/ is usually [d9] after /G/, e.g. F`sGH
‘night’ is transcribed as [F`sGd9]. Sapir also records the [d9] allophone word-medially in a few
cases: GhGHrrtK ‘bloody-eyed’ is transcribed as [GεGd9rrtK].
Evidently this lowering influence also extends to some preceding high vowels:15(3)/StG,/ [SåG]
/jtG/ [jåG]‘head’
‘hole’(Sapir 1924: 85, note 20)
(Sapir 1924: 87, note 36)Table 4 summarizes the effects of pharyngeals on the high vowels that can be gleaned from
Sapir’s (1924) transcriptions. More study is required to determine the conditioning environments
for those segments listed with multiple allophones, and also to determine whether the gaps in
Table 4 are real or only due to lack of data.

F`opH ‘(on) the summit’ is transcribed by Sapir (1924: 87, note 44) as [pdg].","[28, 29, 30, 31]"

The unextended word in (150), the verb M, N vdFhC ‘sleeping’, contains no lexical suffixes or
aspectual morphemes –– it is a bare root.

vdFhC
sleep‘sleeping’
In (151)a, the Makah verb is composed of vdFhC, functioning as the base, plus a lexical suffix,
the locative suffix -""`Wr ‘in a vessel’. The verb in (151)b is composed of the bound verb root
F`bj`s, ‘jump’ as base plus -""`Wr and the perfective aspect suffix -hQ.

The base can be a root as in (151) or an already derived base, making word structure recursive.
For example, the verb from (151)a vdFhE`Wr ‘sleeping in a canoe’ is base to another lexical suffix, the verbalizing suffix ,tF`K ‘perceive ... (perf.)’ in (152).

base and suffixes, are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Not indicated in Figure 1 is the fact that words may also be marked as plural or distributive
by reduplication, infixation, or some combination of the two. Such plural/distributive marking is
grammatically optional and subject to many formal irregularities. See §5.5.4 for examples.
Depending on its syntactic role and position in a sentence, the morphological construct of
base + lexical suffixes + aspect (called the “unextended” word by Swadesh 1933, 1939) can take
additional formatives known variously as “incremental suffixes” (Swadesh 1933, Sapir &
Swadesh 1939), “word suffixes” (Swadesh 1939), “inflectional suffixes” (Rose 1981), or
“peripheral suffixes” (Nakayama 1997a) to form an “extended” word. Such formatives express
clause-level grammatical categories like tense, mood, voice, and pronominal indexes.
Though all the aforementioned authors refer to these formatives as “suffixes” of one type or
another, their status as such is actually rather ambivalent. They differ from lexical and aspect suffixes on a number of phonological, morphological, and semantic points (see Chapter 7 for a summary list). Some researchers (e.g. Klokeid 1976, 1978, Jacobsen 1979a: 151, note 31, Renker
1987) have suggested that these formatives in Ditidaht and Makah are actually clitics (an analysis
that extends easily to Nuuchahnulth as well).47 This idea appears to account for a number of their
syntactic properties.
The unextended word carries the lexical (dictionary) meaning of the word, while the clitics
specify values for grammatical categories associated with the word in its syntactic context. As
Swadesh (1933: 11) puts it for Nuuchahnulth: “From the lexical point of view, the word is the
unextended unit composed of stem plus derivational and aspect suffixes. From the syntactic point
of view, the word is the total phonetic unity, sometimes identical with the lexical unit, sometimes
more or less extended by [enclitic] elements.” In (153), for example, Makah vdFhE`k ‘he/she/it is95sleeping’ is formed from the verb vdFhC ‘sleep’ plus the temporal specifier clitic <""`Q glossed
“TEMP” (explained in §4.3.2 below) and<?h, the third person singular Indicative mood clitic.
(153)MAKAHvdFhE`k
vdFhC<""`Q<?h
sleep=TEMP=INDIC.3sg‘He/she/it is sleeping.’
In general, words functioning as predicate heads in main clauses have the greatest potential for
hosting clitics. The clitics occur in an ordered sequence of slots following their host (§7.5). First
come clitics coding categories like the causative, passive-inverse, and tense. Next are mood and
pronominal clitics indexing subjects and, in Makah, some non-subjects. As seen in (153), third
person formatives in Makah have fused with mood clitics. In Nuuchahnulth, there is no marking
for third person in most moods. Finally, a word may end with one or more clitics drawn from a
small post-modal set that includes a morpheme expressing the plurality of a third person participant, a morpheme meaning ‘again’, and a habitual marker. See §4.3 for more on clitics and their
place in the structure of the predicate.
4.2.2Lexical suffixesThe 500 or so lexical suffixes can be divided into two main types (§5.3). The first type, nuclear
suffixes (§5.4), includes nominalizing suffixes (154) and verbalizing suffixes (155):
(154)Examples of nominalizing suffixesM ,`Bhr, N ,`Btr ‘surface, platform for ...’
M ,HshFh9, N ,Hs` ‘... -er’
M ,(j)r`b, N ,(b)r`b ‘container, vessel for ...’
M ,x`ji, N ,X`ji ‘thing, instrument for ...’
(155)Examples of verbalizing suffixesM ,`a`9Bt, N ,l`Btj ‘talking about ...’M, N ,Jtj [R] ‘resembling ...’96M ,Bhr, N ,Btr [L] ‘laughing at ...’M, N ,O`K ‘smelling like ...’M ,c@ji, N ,m@ji ‘having ...’M ,rta`C, N ,rhlC [L] ‘do ritual for ...’M ,hctW, N ,M@G ‘seeking ...’M ,tF`K, N ,(x)tF`K ‘perceive ... (perf.)’The second type, restrictive suffixes (§5.5), consists mostly of suffixes indicating spatial disposition including path-orientation suffixes (156) and locative suffixes (157):
(156)Examples of path-orientation suffixesM, N ,(-F)`K ‘attached on’
M ,@xhQ, N ,`xh9FhQ ‘enter a building (perf.)’
M, N -jihr,s, ‘move away from (perf.)’
M ,a`K,, N ,l`K, ‘moving about’
N ,MHp, ‘down a slope (perf.)’
(157)Examples of locative suffixesM ,""`Wr, N -""`Gr ‘in a vessel’
M, N ,@rB` ‘on the roof’
N ,hmjrS`r ‘at the back of the head’
M ,`chK, N ,(v)hmK [L] ‘on the neck’
M ,(j)rF`shFh9, N ,(b)rF`st [L] ‘at the door’
At least since Sapir (1924) ellipses, i.e. the symbol “...”, have been included in the glosses of
nuclear suffixes to indicate the relation of the meaning of the suffix to that of the base, that is,
where the meaning of the base “fits” in the meaning of the suffix. Ellipses are not used in glosses
of restrictive suffixes because they have essentially additive relations with bases that are always
semantically predictable. In this dissertation nuclear ellipses are used only with glosses in the
body of the text and not in morpheme-by-morpheme glosses for reasons of economy.","[108, 109, 110, 111, 112]"
