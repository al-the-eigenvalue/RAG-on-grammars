"24.1.2.3. Predicate focus
The subject is postposed to the postverbal position when the focus extends over
the verb alone. This covers the following cases: (i) an ""urgent news"" report
(1775); (ii) when the verb is in potential contrast (1776) or questioned (yes-no
questions as in (1777) and answers to them); or (iii) when the action itself is
emphasized and presented with an effect of immediateness (1778).
(1775) a.b.",[880]
"23.1.5.3.1. Alternative indirect question without negation
In non-finite subordinate complement clauses an alternative question is
expressed with the indefinite pro-verb ja- which takes the same morphological
form as the subordinate clause predicate (namely, the participle in the
Accusative). The disjunctive particle -dA ... -dA follows the subordinate clause
predicate and the second predicate expressed by the indefinite pro-verb ja-.
Although formally the clause is organized as an alternative question, questions
without negation in fact correspond semantically to indirect polar (yes-no)
questions ('whether'-questions).
(1693) a.",[851]
"23.1.2. Yes-no questions
Yes-no questions are not marked by any additional morphological means or
changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence.
They are differentiated from them only by intonational patterns: the last word is
marked by a higher and more prolonged intonational contour (3.6.4). The finite
verb normally occupies the clause-final position. Examples (1675) show
ordinary yes-no questions, and examples (1676) illustrate negative yes-no
questions.
(1675) a.b.c.(1676) a.",[843]
"7.8.1.3.2. Perfect in yes-no questions
Close to the resultative function is the use of the Perfect in yes-no questions
which refer to the situation in the past, whereas in w/i-questions about an event
in the past it is typically the Past tense that is used. In such an utterance the
focus domain extends over the verb alone.",[288]
"23.1.4. Alternative questions
There are several types of alternative questions. None of these types is formed
with only one disjunctive element (such as or in English). Instead two
disjunctive elements are used. Intonation typically rises at the end of the first
disjunct and falls at the end of the sentence.",[845]
"23.1.4.1. Alternative questions with the pro-verb
The alternative question can be formed with the pro-verb ja- as the second
disjunct. The pro-verb takes the same morphological form as the finite verb in
the first disjunct: in (1681a) they are both in the 2nd person Singular Future, in
(1681b) in the 3rd person Singular Present. This type is used when the
alternatives are described by the same verb in a positive and a negative form.",[845]
"3.6.4. Sentence stress
Typically, the intonation falls at the end of the sentence. However in yes-no
questions and disjunctive questions (23.1.2, 23.1.4) intonation rises
considerably on the last word of the sentence. When the last word of a sentence
is prominent, this may be expressed by a rising pitch on the stressed vowel. In
the examples below an acute accent indicates a rising pitch.

23.2. Negation
Except for some special constructions, Udihe does not make the formal
difference between sentence negation and constituent negation. Examples of
these two negation types are presented below in 23.2.1 and 23.2.2, respectively.
In both cases, negation is expressed with the negative auxiliary verb e-/ei-,
which precedes the content verb and may take various morphological forms,
e.g. e-si-ti etete-du 'they were not working' <NEG-PAST-3PL work-PL>, e-s'e-li
etete 'without having worked' <NEG-PERF-CC.SS work>. For more
information on the conjugation of the negative verb and the form of the content
verb in negative sentences see 7.3 and 7.1.4. In certain copular constructions
negation is expressed by the impersonal copula anci 'no'.
Normally, the negative verb immediately precedes the content verb;
however, it is sometimes possible for it to be placed after the verbal stem, as
below.
(1699) a.b.","[853, 854]"
"22.2.4. Predicate dropping
In (1587) we illustrate an ellipsis of the verb which is immediately recoverable
from the linguistic context. The usual answer to a wA-question consists only of
a questioned constituent in a fully inflected form (1587b). Examples (1588)
present an instance of colloquial speech where all the verbs are omitted, so that
the predicative functions seem to be fulfilled by adverbial expressions.
(1587) a.",[808]
"23.1.5.3.2. Alternative indirect questions with negation
In alternative indirect questions with negation the negative alternative is
highlighted and the negative verb e- functions as a predicate of the second
disjunct. As in indirect alternative questions without negation, in non-finite
clauses predicates in both disjuncts are marked with the particle -dA ... -dA
(1695), while in the finite clause the particles -As(i)... -As(i) (1696) or -nu ...
-nu (1697) are present.

seems basically to have the same meaning as the particle -As(i) ... -As(i),
although it is likely to render a greater degree of emphasis. Below it is shown
following the predicate and the non-predicate constituent, although the former

Contrastive questions are marked by the focus clitic particle -nA or -nu
following a contrastive element. In w/i-questions the particle is used when the
subject questioned is in explicit or implicit contrast with certain other elements
(1677). In polar questions it normally follows a focused predicate (1678), while
(1679) shows a focus on the spatial adverb. The contrastive word is marked by
a rise in intonation, but the clitic does not attract it to itself.

"23.1.1. W7i-questions
In w/i-questions the question word (a certain form of the Interrogative pronoun)
replaces the questioned constituent. Question words are listed in 9.5. Any
constituent of the main clause can be questioned in this way. The position of
the question word is strictly before the finite predicate, in accordance with the
more general rule on the preverbal position of the focus element (24.1.1). The
only exception is the question word i:mi 'why' (23.1.1.6). In questions to the
modifier the whole modified noun phrase must immediately precede the
predicate. The preverbal question word, like other focus elements (24.1.1), may
be sentence-initial (1647), however, other constituents (in particular the
subject) can precede it, as in (1648).

sentences see Chapter 18). It follows the finite verb in the first disjunct and the

The finite subordinate clause is described in Chapter 18. In indirect constituent
questions the question word immediately precedes the subordinate clause
predicate. The question word (interrogative pronoun) may have the same form
as regular question words used in direct questions (9.5). Alternatively, indirect
questions may be formed with non-specific indefinite pronouns derived with
the clitic particle -dA (9.6.2), which function here as interrogative pronouns
(1691). In both cases, the subordinate clause is not followed by any evidential
particles, even if this is required for the corresponding non-interrogative
subordinate clauses (18.3.1).
