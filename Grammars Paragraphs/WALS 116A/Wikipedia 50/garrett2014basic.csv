"LBy 1902 (ALK)QuestionsQuestions are of the following two types:
• In a yes–no question, there are only a couple of natural answers. For example, thelikely answers to the English question Will you help me? are either Yes or No (or some
expansion or equivalent).
• In a content question, the range of likely answers is broader. For example, given theEnglish question Who will help me?, there are numerous possible answers depending
on the circumstances: Alice, Bert, Charlie, Donna, etc.
In many languages, yes–no questions and content questions are formed in different
ways. In English, for example, content questions use a word such as where?, what?,
why?, etc., while yes–no questions are formed by changing word order: Can you hear
me? Yurok too has two different methods for forming the two types of questions.",[123]
"9.3.1 Yes–no questions
Yes–no questions are formed using the question particle hes, positioned either at the
end of the sentence (this is less common) or (more often) after the ﬁrst word or phrase
of the sentence. The examples below are divided into two groups: neutral questions,
whose answer might be “yes” or “no” (§9.3.1.1), and questions whose expected answer
is “no” (§9.3.1.2).
9.3.1.1Neutral yes–no questionsThe most common position for hes is immediately after the ﬁrst word of the sentence,
as in (160).
(160)Questions with hes after the ﬁrst word
(a) Kel’ hes keech cherhkwerm’?
“Are you jumping center?”",[123]
"Sentence patterns/959.3.2 Content questions
Unlike yes–no questions, content questions seek a more open-ended answer to questions like “who?”, “when?”, “where?”, etc. They can be classiﬁed according to the type of
information they seek, and also according to their form. In Yurok, content questions are
formed using one of the question words tee’now, tee’neeshoo, and kues. Among these,
kues is the most ﬂexible.
9.3.2.1 Who? What?
Questions that ask “who?”, as in (164), use the question word tee’now.
(164) Questions with tee’now
(a)Tee’now puen’?
“Who farted?”(b) Tee’now swechohpen’ kue ’ahtemar?
“Who opened the letter?”
(c) Tee’now helomey’?
“Who’s dancing?”
(d) Tee’now ho helomey’?
“Who was dancing?”
(e)Tee’now keech kweryerw’?
“Who whistled?”","[125, 126]"

9.3.1.2Questions expecting a negative answerSome questions presuppose that a negative answer is likely. An English example is Don’t
you see the hawk?, to which a likely answer is No, I don’t see it. In Yurok, much as in
English, such questions are formed with negatives. Examples are in (163).
(163)Questions expecting a negative answer
(a) Neemee hes newoom’ kuech kue ’ne-ka’ar?
“Haven’t you seen my pet, grandmother?”
(b) Kuech, nee mok’w hes ’oyhl kee nepek’?
“Grandmother, isn’t there anything lying here for me to eat?”
(c) Nee mok’w hes k’-ohsepek’?
“Aren’t you ashamed?”",[125]
"JJ 2004 (JB)The example in (96a) was given as a good, positive answer to the question Komchuepa’
hes? “Do you know me?” The example in (96b) would be appropriate if the speaker at
ﬁrst could not remember the other person, and then suddenly recalled: “Oh, now I know
you!” That is, keech signals a change of situation from not knowing to knowing.
The difference between keech and ’ochkaa is illustrated in (97–100).
(97)(a)Keech swoo’mel’.
“He stinks (from contact with something).”(b) ’Ochkaa swoo’mel’.
“He stinks (naturally).”
(98)(99)(a)YL 1951Keech no’oyek’.
“I have shoes on.”",[104]
"10.2.1Verbs in no’om- “how long”Verbs that begin with the relative root no’om- answer (or ask) the question “how long?”
They typically refer to a distance, as in the examples in (189), where ’oteesh “a foot (in
length)” and k’e-yah “your belly” indicate the length.
(189)(a) ’Oteesh no’omel’.
“It was a foot long.”
(b) Mocho kee wohpeyem’, kwesee k’e-yah kee no’omuel’.
“If you cross, then it (the water) will be up to your belly.”",[135]
"2.6ParticlesThe term particle refers to a set of ﬁve different word classes which share two features:
all of them have relatively few words, ranging from only two articles to a few dozen
preverbs; and in all cases they cannot be used on their own to form utterances. Particles
occur only with other words. For example, since you can answer a question with just
an adverb, an adverb is not a particle: if someone asks where you’re going, you can just
answer lekwsee “outside”. A noun is not a particle because if someone asks what you want
to eat, you can say nepuy “salmon” by itself. But you cannot say words like keetee, ’ochkaa,
k’ee, or kwelekw on their own without being part of a larger phrase or sentence. The ﬁve
Yurok word classes that can be regarded as particles are detailed in §§2.6.1–2.6.5.",[51]
"10.2.2VM 1994 (BJ)Verbs in son- “how”Verbs that begin with the relative root son- (or its variants sern-, soo-, or serr-) answer
(or ask) the question “how?” They refer to a manner of being or doing, and must be
used with a word or phrase that expresses the manner. For example, as in (191), the
verb serrnerh “be (a particular) color, it is colored (thus)” requires an expression like
won “differently”.
(191)Won nee kee serrnerh k’e-wa’aw.
“Your ﬂoor will be a different color.”",[135]
"Vocabulary patterns10.2.3/105Verbs in tom- “how much”Verbs that begin with the relative root tom- answer (or ask) the question “how much?”
They typically refer to an amount or quantity, and require an amount expression or a
place-holder like kues “how (much)?” or wek “this”. Examples of tomoyek’ “I am (a particular age or size)” are given in (194a–b).
(194)(a)Wek tomoyek’.
“I am this tall, I am this old.”
(b) Yo na’mee lok keech tom’.
“He is now two years old.”","[135, 136]"
"GT 2003 (YLCB)LT 1922 (GR)GT 2003 (YLCB)YL 1951FS 1980 (PP)Questions that ask “what?”, as in (165), use the question word tee’neeshoo. As a rule,
tee’neeshoo questions are used with verbs that ordinarily have a noun as their (missing)
subject or object. In (165c), the missing noun is understood with mehl “about”.
(165) Questions with tee’neeshoo
(a)Tee’neeshoo kee nepem’?
“What are you going to eat?”",[126]
"10.2.4Verbs in weno’om- “how far”Verbs that begin with the relative root weno’om- answer (or ask) the question “how far?”
They typically refer to a location (in space or time), and are used only in sentences where
an additional word or phrase indicates the location. In (195a), for example, the location
is indicated by wee’ “that (place)”, and in (195b) it is expressed by poyew noohl “far ahead”.
(195)(a)Kel’ kem wee’ ho weno’omuerem’.
“You too swam there.”
(b) Poyew noohl weno’omor’ kue mewah.
“The boy is running far ahead.”",[136]
"GT 2003 (YLCB)Tee’neeshoo questions often have subjunctive verbs. Then they mean something like
“What is it that . . .?” and may be emphasized with weesh or wee’. Examples are in (166).
(166) Questions with tee’neeshoo and subjunctive verbs
(a)Tee’neeshoo mehl k’e-chwegeen?

"2.4 Pronouns
A pronoun is a kind of word that stands in place of a noun. It may be the subject or object
of a verb, for example, but its reference may differ from sentence to sentence, depending
on context. English pronouns include words like me, that, and what. Yurok pronouns are
of three types:
• personal pronouns refer to “I”, “you”, “me”, etc.: nek, kel’, nekah, kelew, etc.
• demonstrative pronouns refer to a third person, that is, “s/he”, “that one”, “them”, etc.:yo’, wee’eeet, etc.
• question (or interrogative) pronouns include words like kues “how?”, tee’now “who?”,tee’neeshoo “what?”, and other words in forming content questions (§9.3.2).",[50]

kues no’ohl are more common in reference to future time, and questions with kues cho’
are more common in reference to past time. Examples of the two constructions are given
in (170–171).
(170) Questions with kues cho’ “when?”

seen in (112-113) on pages 78-78 above, cho’ can be used with ﬁrst-person and thirdperson verbs to express exhortation (“must, should”).
Alternatively, to urge a group that includes the speaker to do something, a construction with chyue kee (or chyue kue) is often used. This is shown in (158).

"6.4.1 Forming subjunctives
The subjunctive preﬁxes and endings are shown in Table 6.7 on page 55. The forms in
this table have preﬁxes; their endings make singular forms look like 1 sg verbs, but preﬁxes disambiguate key forms. Examples of subjunctive clauses (underlined) with skewok
are given in (55) for statements and in (56) for questions.
¹ Subjunctive verbs were called pronominal-prefix verbs in R. H. Robins’s The Yurok language (1958; for the
full reference see the Bibliography on page 299). A subjunctive non-inﬂected verb is in fact indistinguishable
from a possessed noun; the word ’ue-pa’ah may be interpreted as “for it to be wet” (non-inﬂected verb) or
“its water” (noun). An alternative linguistic term for subjunctives might be subordinative, because they are
associated with subordinate clauses.",[85]

(b) Kues sochpeyewem’?
“What are you saying?”",[181]
"The general past category in (75a) is very frequent; sentences that refer to past time
often lack preverbs of time, especially in narratives describing successive events. This is
shown in (76) with consecutive sentences from a story told by Florence Shaughnessy.
(76)(a) Hehlkue nee raayor’.
“He ran along the bank.”
(b) Kwesee kolchee kol’ ’okw’ hehlkue, neskwee ’emehl raayor’ kue ’yoch.
“And once he was somewhere on the river bank, (and) the boat was passing
near him.”
FS 1951 (YL)Each verb in (76) refers to an event in a past-time narrative sequence; none occurs with
a preverb of time.

in answering questions. This is shown in Table 7.2 on page 67. If you ask what was

and non-inflected verbs.
A distinctive feature of Yurok numerals and color terms is that they change form
depending on the meaning of what they are applied to; a different form of “two” or “lightcolored” is used for snakes and for human beings. This is a classificatory system; it
is how Yurok organizes phenomena in the world. Numerals show more different forms

"5.1 Overview
Many details of verb formation are in chapters 5–6. First, an overview of some of the
most important categories of inﬂected verbs may be useful. The speciﬁc categories identiﬁed pertain to mood, a linguistic term which refers broadly to the type of sentence or
clause that a verb appears in. Yurok inﬂected verbs have four different moods, as follows:
• indicative (discussed in this chapter): used in most simple statements and questions
• imperative (discussed in this chapter): used in direct commands
• subjunctive (§6.4): typically used when one verb is dependent on another verb
• attributive (§6.5): used in phrases that modify or stand in for nouns38/Basic verb formationThe four moods have somewhat different endings, and are used in different ways.
Given in (37) are forms of hegook’ “I walk, I go”: an indicative, an imperative, a subjunctive, and an attributive.
(37)5.2(a) indicative: Nek keetee hegook’ so Rek’woy.
“I am going to go to Requa.”
(b) imperative: Hego’och so kue muenchey nahko’!
“Go to the white board!”
(c) subjunctive: Nek weet soneenepek’ kee ’n-egook’.
“I think I will go.”
(d) attributive: Soo smeykoluemee’ kue keech hegookween.
“They miss the one who has gone.”","[68, 69]"
"10.3.1NumeralsA few of the most common sets of numerals (from 1 to 10 only) are shown in Table
10.1 above and Table 10.2 on page 107. As the tables illustrate, the structure of Yurok
numerals is as follows. Each numeral from 1 to 4 is a single word, changing its form
according to the type of thing being counted. Above 5, the numerals consist of two (or
more) words: the ﬁrst word is usually an invariant form, like kohchew “six”, and the
second word changes its form depending on what is being counting. The last line in
each table shows the form used in questions: to ask “How many are there?” you need to
know what kind of thing you are asking about.
Included in Tables 10.1–10.2 are the numerals for various classes: people; animals;
round things and money (since coins are round); numbers of times (“once”, “twice”, etc.);
things shaped like sticks; ﬂat things; and sacks and bundles. Yurok has other sets of
numerals as well: for things shaped like ropes or snakes, for plants and bushy things,Vocabulary patterns/sticks and straight

The following verbs are described in this chapter.
chyuuek’wenek’ “I sit down” (p. 260)
key “sit” (p. 261)
koo’opek’ “I stand up” (p. 262)
lekolek’ “I fall” (p. 263)
’ooleenek’ “I lie down” (p. 264)’oolo’ “stand” (p. 265)
’oyhlkesek’ “I lie down” (p. 266)
tektee’ “it sits” (p. 268)
tepon’ “it stands” (p. 269)For human beings and animals, there are six main verbs of posture: three that refer to
being (continuing to be) in a position, and three that refer to change of position. They
fall into three groups — standing, sitting, lying — with the following usage patterns:
change of positionposition in a locationsitchyuuek’wenek’ (∼ chyuuk’w ∼ rek’eeen)animate key (∼ keychek’eenek’)
inanimate tektee’ (∼ tek)standkoo’opek’ (∼ koo’ ∼ ko’oh)animate ’oolo’ (∼ ’oolo’oh ∼ ’oolo’opek’)
inanimate tepon’ (∼ tep ∼ ro’oh)lie’ooleenek’’oyhlkesek’ (∼ ’oyhl)Verbs in the change of position column are used when the subject assumes the position (for example, standing up from a sitting position) or moves to a new position.
Verbs in the position in a location column are used as background or to identify the
location of the subject — for example, answering the question “Where is it?”
In two of the categories above, Yurok distinguishes between two verbs for position
in a location. For example, key refers to animates (people, animals, birds) sitting,
and tek refers to inanimates (such as rocks and plants) sitting. And ’oolo’ refers to animates standing, while tepon’ refers to inanimates (usually trees) standing. Note that
inanimates include plants and trees; the “animates” are really things that are not ﬁxed
in location.","[289, 290]"

FS 1980 (PP)The use of the proximal demonstrative pronouns can be clearly seen in examples
with context. For instance, in a story about driving her father to the doctor when she was
young, Florence Shaughnessy said that his friends asked him how he would get there.
Mrs. Shaughnessy quoted his answer in (30); the language suggests that his daughter
was nearby, and maybe he pointed her out.

“Well, she knows how. This girl knows how to drive.”

neemee is more common; mos occurs in an important but restricted set of situations.",[110]

in meaning from verbs like peloyek’ “I am big” (page 162), which can refer to being old,
or cheykelek’ “I am small” (page 158), which can refer to being young. By itself, tomoyek’
implies nothing about old or young age.

"7.1 Background
There are several important differences between the Yurok and English systems of time
reference. One concerns basic tense categories. In English, the basic categories are
past vs. present vs. future: “I saw” vs. “I see” vs. “I will see”. Many languages have an
English-style three-way set, but many other languages — including Yurok — have different systems. It is possible to distinguish past-time and future-time preverbs in Yurok,
but the basic system is more nuanced.
A second important difference has to do with present vs. past time. In English,
whenever you use a verb you must choose between a present-time form (I see) or a
past-time form (I saw), among other verb forms. A distinction between present and
past is obligatory in English grammar. But in Yurok, depending on context, verbs may
express either present or past time; for example, newook’ can mean either “I see” or “I
(recently) saw”. The context will usually make the intended meaning clear.
A third important difference concerns aspect. Linguists use this term to describe
such concepts as starting and completing an action, as well as the viewpoint that a
speaker chooses on an action being described (for example, depicting it as ongoing or
unitary). You do not need to know this terminology, but the concepts sometimes play a
key role in Yurok preverb choice.
Table 7.1 on page 65 lists the eight Yurok categories of time reference described
in this chapter, with the frequency of each preverb. By far the most frequent is keech;
second is kee. Many preverbs of time are omitted from Table 7.1 and are not discussed
here. They would be included in a complete study of Yurok grammar, though some are
poorly documented, making it hard to understand all their nuances.",[94]

Meaning and usage
This verb means “treat (it) in a speciﬁed way”, for example “well” (skuy’) or “badly” (keem’).
Sentences with sonkook’ usually express both the object that is treated in some way, and
the way in which it is treated. For example, in (218), kue ’yoch “the boat” is the object and
the question word kues “how?” expresses the manner. The passive, illustrated in (219),
is the most common form.
