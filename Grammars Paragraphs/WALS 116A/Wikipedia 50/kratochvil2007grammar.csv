"3.5.7Question wordsThe last closed grammatical category contains question words. In Abui, question words
are forms such as nala ‘what’, maa ‘who’, te ‘where, how’, teina ‘when’ and yeng ‘how
much’. These forms always remain ‘in situ’; i.e. in the syntactic position of the
questioned constituent. The question word nala ‘what’ is used as default question word
referring to non-human entities. In (176), nala ‘what’ occurs in two different syntactic
positions. In (a), it occurs clause finally, questioning the identity of the referred object.
In (b), it occurs in the position of the U argument, questioning the complement of ong
‘make’.

"2SG what
make
‘what are you doing/making?’The question word nala may be used to question the species or kind of an entity. This
is illustrated in (177). In (a), the kind of a tree is questioned. In (b), the name of a place
is asked in a construction that involves a relative clause:

3II.INAL-name
‘what is the name of this place/land?’nala?what[Note.010.01]The form nala ‘what’ can be used in both interrogative and indicative constructions.
Although both constructions have identical word orders, they are differentiated by their
intonational contour. In (176)-(177) nala ‘what’ is used in interrogative constructions.
In (178), the form nala is used to refer to non-specific entities and is translated as
‘something’. In both cases, the form nala expresses a non-specific U argument of the
verbs nee ‘eat’ and lakda ‘read’:GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES129(178) a. Simon nala nee

‘teacher pointed at me (that) I read something’[B10.020.07]The question word maa ‘who’ is used to question the identity of humans. It may not be
used to refer to animates. This is illustrated in (179). In (a), the speaker assumes a nonhuman actor that caused a bite. In (b), the speaker assumes that the bite is caused by a
human.

question word teina ‘when’ occurs in the left edge of a clause, a typical location for
temporal adverbs, or phrases that indicate the temporal location of an event. In (188),21 The question word teina ‘when’ is possibly derived. It could be historically derived from the combination of
two verb stems te-i ‘put where’ and the index verb stem na ‘be like this’ that compose the notion of ‘when’ a
question about the temporal location of an event that is identical to the event described in the second clause.","[152, 153]"

In this chapter, I discuss Abui nouns and noun phrases. Abui nouns are defined by
their referential properties as lexical items referring to time-stable concrete entities
(unique persons, places, or objects, discussed in 4.1). There are also lexical items that
refer to less concrete (typically) uncountable objects and substances. These lexical items
are ambiguous as they may as well refer to events, and they are analysed as categorially
indetermined (see section 3.2.2). Their grammatical category is determined by their
syntactic context. When an ambiguous item is inserted in the head position of an NP
structure; it is identified as a noun.
In Abui, there is a systematic difference between animate and inanimate
referents. Animate referents are typically expressed by unambiguously nominal lexical
items. Nouns referring to animates are treated differently in grammatical operations
such as possessive inflection or person inflection on the verbs (see 3.2.4). Inanimate
nouns have a more generic reference and denote substances rather than individuated
objects; they are underspecified for number, shape or size. In discourse, inanimate
nouns often combine with other elements that specify their number, shape, or size.
Abui nouns combine with pronominal prefixes that express possessors (see
section 4.2). Nouns can be derived by compounding and nominalization of verbal
roots, as discussed in section 4.3. Nouns serve as the head constituent of a noun
phrase, presented in section 4.4. In addition to possessors, the head noun combines
with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives, modifier nouns,
stative verbs, adjectives, quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives. The order of these
constituents is fixed (see 4.4.5). Optionally, an NP may contain an embedded modifier,
typically a relative clause (see section 4.5). Besides expressing arguments, NPs may
serve as the main predicate of a sentence, as a nominal predicate. This chapter ends
with an overview of nominal predicates in section 4.6.","[153, 154, 155, 156]"
"2.2.1Distribution of consonantsThe following overview of the phonotactic distribution of Abui consonants takes into
account their occurrence in (i) syllables: either in syllable onset or coda; and in (ii)
words: either in word-initial, word-medial or word-final position:

combine with possessive prefixes, which are open light syllables consisting of a

to the kind of the referent. The indexed events and referents are located on the familiar
PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL axis. This axis is found also in Abui demonstratives and
deictic verbs. Note that the perfect stems nu and hu have been grammaticalized as
anaphoric demonstratives indicating ‘specificity’. For more details, see section 3.5.2.2.
Abui index verbs are used in questions and in constructions that express the
kind of the referent. The kind of a referent and the manner of an event is described in a
complement clause that serves as an argument of the index verb.11 The proximal index
verbs na/ni/n-u ‘be like.PRX’ are used to refer to the manner and kind obvious and
familiar to both speech participants. The medial index verbs wa/wi ‘be like.MD’ are
frequently used in questions. The speaker presents the questioned manner or kind as
medial. The distal index verbs ha/hi/h-u ‘be like.DST’ are used to refer to manner or
kind that is not familiar to the speaker. The verb ha ‘be like.DST’ may be used to refer
to the manner in which the addressee intends to perform an event, from which the
speaker wants to dissociate himself.
An example of the manner anaphoric use is given in (112). The verb stem wa
‘be like.MD’ combines with the argument, expressed with the pronominal prefix do(3I.REC). It refers to the rain that prevented the participant from going to the market.

[B07.079.01]An example of the use referring to the kind of referent is given in (113). The index verb
ha ‘be like.DST’ occurs as a single predicate in a question. This question is used in

‘what is the word ‘anjing’ (in Abui)?’[Note.009.07]In (114), the perfect stem n-u ‘be like.PRX’ combines with pronominal prefix he(3II.LOC). It marks the first clause as a manner in which the event described in the
11 Index verbs semantically group the manner of event (in fact kind of event) and the kind of referent in
adnominal and question uses. In the literature similar predicates were referred to as kind-anaphoric predicates
(cf. Landman and Morzycki, 2003:11).","[129, 130]"

"3 Grammatical Categories
In this chapter, I describe Abui grammatical categories. Grammatical categories are
sometimes referred to as ‘part-of-speech classes’; they are the building blocks of
linguistic structures. Grammatical categories are either open or closed. Open categories
contain a virtually unlimited number of items, while closed categories have a limited set
of members. In Abui, open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed
grammatical categories are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers,
adverbs and question words.
In Abui, many lexical items appear to be ambiguous. Their categorial
membership must be determined by the combination of their distributional, functional,
and semantic properties (cf. Schachter, 1985; Andward et al., 1997). With the term
‘distributional properties’ I refer to the word-internal (morphological) and wordexternal (syntactic) distribution of an item. In section 3.1, I give an overview of Abui
morphology describing various morpheme types (bound, free, prefixes, suffixes, roots,
and stems).
Word-external (syntactic) distributional properties refer to the status of items in
syntactic units such as phrases, clauses and sentences. Items may be restricted in their
distribution within syntactic units; not all items may occur as heads. Items have
different functional properties. They can express various grammatical functions such as
arguments, aspectual markers, or linkers. Finally, items can have a different type of
reference (time-stable or versatile) and different referents (persons, events, etc.).
In section 3.2, I describe nouns. Nouns are items that canonically refer to timestable concepts such as persons, objects or places. The nominal reference is permanent.
Pronouns are discussed in section 3.3. Pronouns refer to time-stable concepts,
however, their reference is not permanent as the nominal reference but versatile and
context dependent. In section 3.4, I discuss Abui verbs. Verbs are defined
morphologically as items that may combine with REC pronominal prefix and aspectual
markers. Syntactically, they are the head of a verb phrase. Verbs serve as predicates in a
clause and may combine with arguments.
The remainder of this chapter gives an overview of closed grammatical
categories; they are discussed in section 3.5. The closed grammatical categories are
adjectives (3.5.1), demonstratives (3.5.2), quantifiers (3.5.3), aspectual markers (3.5.4),
conjunction markers (3.5.6), adverbs (3.5.5), and question words (3.5.7).","[89, 90]"

participants. As illustrated in (132) an NP is linked with the linker ba (LNK) to the
adverb el ‘before’ that is followed by the anaphoric demonstrative lo (MD). The
construction is an answer to the question ‘what are you roasting there?’ The speaker
says that the fish was actually a bit ‘smelly’ and explains ‘so that is why I am roasting it’.

presents the information as medial (less proximate) from the point of view of the
addressee (a) and serves to draw his attention. In (b), the speaker uses yo (MD.AD) to
present new information in a way as if the addressee is actually aware of it.

‘dog that died’ and informs what happened to it. To mark this contrast the NP is
combined with the anaphoric demonstrative yo (MD.AD) that indicates that the referent
is medial (less proximate) in discourse with respect to the addressee.

‘that dog (you talked about before) that died, his owner took it and buried’ [B05.047.04]There are two demonstratives hu (SPC) and nu (SPC.AD) that are restricted to the
anaphoric function. They do not have a deictic use and never precede the head noun, as
illustrated in (135).

‘a house (you do not know about)’Both forms indicate that the referent is ‘referential’ in the sense that is it ‘accessible’
within the discourse. The anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) contrasts with the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD) that indicates a referent ‘specific’ only for the
speaker. That means that the referent is located only in speaker’s own ‘discourse’ and is
not shared with the addressee. In (136), a fragment of a narrative is presented. A man
ate some of the fragrant betel nut that belonged to his wife and gives this as an
explanation to a giant snake, from which he tries to steal some betel nuts.

[B02.073.07:49]In fact, the anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) serves to introduce a new referent into
discourse and its anaphoricity is questionable. I consider it as anaphoric only within the
discourse of the speaker. It encodes the subtle referential distinction that the presented
referent is only new for the addressee but specific for the speaker. In (137), the use of
the anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) is illustrated. Consider the conversation fragment
where one participant inquires whether addressee’s wife cooks meat. The answer is that
‘some fish’ is being cooked. The NP afu hu ‘some fish’ refers to a ‘fish’ that is only in
discourse of the speaker in A, and thus specific; however, it is not shared with the
speaker in Q for who the information is new.","[137, 138, 139]"

"3.5.6Conjunction markersIn Abui, there are a small number of forms that serve as conjunction markers such as
ba (LNK), ya (SEQ), e ‘and’, and re ‘or’. The coordination marker e ‘and’ occurs only in
the nominal domain. As illustrated in (168), the marker e ‘and’ may combine with
nouns referring to humans and inanimate referents.

be.redIn coordinating constructions, at least two nouns are conjoined by a conjunction
marker or simply listed with an intonational pause after each of the constituents.
Coordinating constructions must be distinguished from list compounds (see section126CHAPTER III4.3.3). The order of constituents in a list compound is lexicalized, while in case of
coordinating construction this is not the case.
The conjunction markers ba (LNK), ya (SEQ), and re ‘or’ may be used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain. The linker ba (LNK) joins two constituents so that they
have shared reference to a single referent or event. I refer to this linker as ‘intersective’.
The intersective linker ba (LNK) may be used in nominal domain to link an NP to other
constituents (relative clauses, numerals, deictics, other NPs) that serve as adnominal
modifiers. In (169), the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the head noun kaai ‘dog’ with
the modifier NP he-bikeng faring ‘his many lice’. The complex NP serves as the A
argument of the verb kafia ‘scrape, scratch’ and it is co-indexed with the prefix do(3I.REC).
(169) [kaai]NP ba

LNK 3II.AL-louse many
DST 3I.REC-scrape-DUR
‘that dog with many lice is scratching (itself) over there’[B05.060.02]In section 4.5, I discuss other structures that are linked with the intersective linker ba
(LNK) to an NP. In the verbal domain, ba (LNK) links two verbs as in (170) the verbs
bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’. The events of ‘carrying’ and ‘going’ refer to a complex event
‘carry towards’.

yaa
drum 3A carry LNK go
‘he carried drums to the village’melangmi-a-d-ivillagebe.in-be.at-hold-PFV
[B02.118.07:50]The linked verbs form a tight unit that falls under the scope of a negation. This
type of construction is different from serial verb constructions, which are defined as a
verb clusters without any conjunction markers (see 8.1). The use of ba (LNK) in the
verbal domain will not be further analysed in the current description.
The intersective linker ba (LNK) contrasts with the non-intersective linker ya
glossed as SEQ(uential). ya (SEQ) indicates a non-intersective union of two constituents
(a sequence of phrases or clauses). It may be used in both nominal and verbal domain.
In the nominal domain, ya (SEQ) links two NPs. This is illustrated in (171), where two
NPs are linked. Recall (169), to see the contrast with ba (LNK) that can not serve as a
coordinating conjunction marker.

[B05.008.06]GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES127In the verbal domain, ya (SEQ) links verbs that retain their own reference so that the
construction is read as a sequence of events. Example (170) is contrasted with example
(172) below. In (172), the verbs bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’ do not refer to a single event
because the ‘carrying’ preceded the ‘going’.

events.

[B06.078.00:37]The linker re ‘or’ indicates a disjoint set of constituents. It is often used in alternative
questions, in which two or more possible answers are presented. It is used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain as illustrated in (174).

SVC with fa ‘be.MD.AD’
The minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ refers to an event location distant from the addressee.
The use of fa implicates realis mode as it marks ‘truly’ occurring events. As realis mode
marker it has also contrastive epistemic function identifying that the information is
either new or unknown to the addressee. The verb fa corresponds roughly in its use to
English ‘actually’. In (101) it is contrasted with two other deictic verbs ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
and la ‘be.MD’ combined in all cases with the major verb sei ‘come down’:

of a questioned car. Note that the deictic verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ corresponds in usage to the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD).

‘yes, I can see it over there’[B07.037.01]It is an interesting detail that the new information is referred to as ‘distant’ from the
addressee. It seems to be a general strategy in Abui, as in most or all languages, that the
temporal and discourse dimension and their operators are mostly transferred from theSERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS407spatial dimension and referred to with spatial operators such as deictic verbs. Another
example is given in (179) where the verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ combines with rul ‘take off’:

SVC with ya ‘be.DST’
The minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ expresses an event location distal from both speech
participants. Its use is illustrated in (180) where the minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ combines
with the verb -iel ‘roast’. In (a) the speaker is located outside the shelter where he is
roasting a fish for the addressee. In such context, he is marked ‘distal’ from the event
location. In (b) the minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ is used because the speaker is roasting a
fish for the addressee inside the shelter, while the addressee is outside:

3II.PAT-roast[B05.042.01]The usage of the minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ is extended to narratives. There it has an
evidential function marking the event as non-witnessed by the speaker but as one that
really happened expressing in fact realis mode. This is illustrated in the narrative
fragment in (181):

speaker, but that he is reporting a narrative, that is: an event that occurred in a distal
time from the moment of speech.","[428, 429, 430]"
"[B07.006.02]VERB PHRASE AND CLAUSE2736.3.3.5
ding kang ‘probably’
The predicate ding kang indicates that an event might possibly occur. In fact the ding
kang consists of free pronoun di (3A) combines with the generic verb ng ‘see’ that
forms a SVC with kang ‘be good’ as illustrated in :

[B07.037.02]The adverbial ding kang possibly originates in a SVC with kang ‘be good’ discussed in
8.4.7.2. It occurs in the clause-initial position and is followed by adverbs and
arguments. It seems plausible to argue that in contexts as (195) the adverbial predicate
ding kang has been lexicalized to an adverb with meaning ‘probably’:
(195) [ding kang]adverbial anui ko

‘probably it will rain’[B07.039.01]6.3.3.6
akun ‘be dark’
The completive verb akun ‘be dark’ indicates the location of an event after some period
of darkness. In (196), an adverbial phrase containing akun ‘be dark’ occurs between the
A argument of the clause and the VP we ‘leave’. The phrase consists of the verb mi ‘be
in’ that refers to a location the darkness, and serves as a complement clause of the
generic verb ng ‘see’. The generic verb ng ‘see’ combines with the completive stem
akun ‘be dark’ in allative serial verb construction (see 8.4.2.1). The adverbial phrase
mi=ng akun could be literally translated as ‘darkened into (it)’.

combines with the verb maran ‘come up’. As in the previous example, the deictic verb

[B07.006.01]The completive stem akun of the verb ‘be dark’ alternates with the stem akung that
refers to an ongoing event of being dark. The completive stem refers to an event of
‘being dark’ that has a final point an can be interpreted as a ‘morning’ or a ‘day’.
6.3.3.7
afe ‘pass’
The adverbial modifier afe ‘pass’ indicates an event that occurred in unspecified past. It
occurs in the left-edge of a relative clause preceding the verb luk ‘rub’, as illustrated in
(199). The adverb wan ‘already’ is a part of the main clause.

war ‘sun’ in (c). It is located in the same position as deictic demonstratives in the NP
and its function is related to that of deictic demonstratives in the sense that it indicates
the location of a period in time. This is not surprising, because Abui NP structure and

SVC with index verbs has a pragmatic extension illustrated in (74).13 The verb
ni-d-i ‘be this way’ is serialized with the verb làk-e ‘leave for’. It refers to the
complement clause marked with the brackets. At the same time it marks the end of the
clause chain. The clause chain that follows usually start with the resumptive verbal form
henil ‘make like this’, derived also from the index verb ni ‘be like.PRX’.

[B06.036.03:36]More examples of the index verbs occurring in tail-head linkage can be found in the
text appendix. The alternation of the verb -l ‘give’ and -d ‘hold’ deriving the complex
verb indicates orientation on either actor or undergoer participant. The generic verb -l
‘give’ occurring in the ‘tail’ of a clause chain is typically alternated with the completive
stem -r ‘reach’ which occurs in the ‘head’ of the subsequent clause chain.

SVC with wa / wi ‘be like.MD’
The minor verb wa/wi ‘be like.MD’ refer to the way or manner in which the event was
performed. This type of manner may be considered as ‘medial’, it is obvious to both
speech participants; however, this type is often used in questions, because the speaker
wants to indicate lower awareness of the manner in which an event was performed. The
13 This strategy is in fact a form of tail head linkage (THL), a typical feature of for many Papuan languages (cf.
de Vries, 2005). In Abui usually last clause is recapitulated in THL constructions. The final verb of
recapitulated clause combines with an complex index verb.","[394, 395]"

second person participant might ‘become evil’. In the first clause, the second person

prefix e- (2SG.LOC). For more information about the attributive serial construction with
the verb d-o ‘hold’, see section 8.4.2.2. In (b), both verbs combine with the verb nee-i
‘eat’. In both cases the clause contains either the location question word te ‘where’ or a
temporal adverb. Some more examples can be found in 8.3.3.2.

be inflected for aspect too, typically with the inceptive markers se/te (INCP). The
aspectual properties of the inceptive markers are similar to the aspect contributed by
the verb re ‘reach’.
The verb re ‘reach’ often occurs in imperative constructions. Two instances are
given in (39). Note that in (b) the verb re ‘reach’ follows the negator naha (NEG) which

clauses such as in (240). It has a nominalising effect on the complement clause which
may be analyzed as a nominal, because it expresses the U argument of the verb ng ‘see’.
The verb ng ‘see’ combines with the verb we ‘leave’ in allative serial verb construction
(see 8.4.2.1). Note, that there is no specialized complementizer in Abui, but the
complement clauses occur in syntactic position of an argument and often combine with
anaphoric demonstratives that seem to serve as nominalizing devices.

function. As illustrated in the following fragment from the narrative moku ayoku, the
information presented in one clause chain is resumed in the initial part of the next
clause chain and marked as background information with an anaphoric demonstrative.
The direct speech given in (242) is resumed in the first clause of (243) and marked with
the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) as background information. The clause ya si-a

SVC with ma ‘be.PRX’
The speaker-proximate event location is expressed with the minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’. An
example is given in (168) where the minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ combines with the verb yei
‘fall’ sharing a single argument. It refers to the location near the speaker where the
referred object ‘fell’:
(168) di
ma
ha-yei?
3A
be.PRX 3II.PAT-fall
‘did it fall here (by me)?’[B05.083.02]Although both verbs in (168) have each their own argument, both pronouns expressing
the arguments have the same reference. The free pronoun di (3A) is the A argument of
the deictic verb ma ‘be.PRX’ while the PAT prefix ha- is the U argument of the verb yei
‘fall’. The minor verb in (168) expresses an event location while in (169) it expresses
potential modality. The minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ expresses an attitude of the speaker
towards the event expressed by the major verb. The major verb is inflected for aspect
with imperfective suffix -e (IPFV).

3I.REC-leave.for-IPFV[B07.019.02]8.4.4.2
SVC with ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
The minor verb ta ‘be.PRX.AD’ encodes the addressee-proximate location of the event.
This is illustrated in example (170) analogous to previous (168) where the minor verb ta
‘be.PRX.AD’ combines with the verb -yei ‘fall’ sharing a single argument:
(170) di

minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ used in a question presupposes the same location of the
speaker with the addressee as illustrated in (a). However, the minor verb ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
refers simply to the location of the addressee, regardless the location of speaker.
Logically the speaker is located elsewhere than the addressee in such situation because
otherwise the verb ma ‘be.PRX’ would be used:

‘is it raining on you (there where you are)?’[B05.083.01]SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS4058.4.4.3
SVC with la ‘be.MD’
The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ expresses a medial (less proximate) event location with
respect to the speaker. The construction is used in situations when the speech
participants talk about events occurring in other locations that are distant from them.
This is illustrated in (100) where the speaker inquires whether the addressee is going to
stay over night in the harbour town encoded as la ‘be.MD’ or come back to the village
where they are both located at that time:
(172) a
la
taa re a-wai?
2SG be.MD lie
or 2SG.PAT-turn
‘will you sleep there or come back?’[B04.009.02]In example (173) the minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is used in a very complex utterance that
uses a number of SVCs. Ignoring the first two clauses, in the third clause the minor
verb la ‘be.MD’ combines with the major verb yaari ‘go’, together with the other two
minor verbs pa ‘touch’ and ng ‘see’ expressing the motion towards a proximate
recipient. The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is used to stress that the location where the
speaker ‘arrived’ is actually distant from his location at the moment of speech:

be.MD=see go.CPL-PFV
‘he was getting ready for it to come when I arrived to him there’[B07.037.03]The location verb SVC with the verb la ‘be.MD’ has a functional extension expressing
modality. It expresses speaker’s opinion that the event expressed with the major verb
happens ‘autonomously’ according its own will. The event is presented as ‘distant’ from
the speaker as illustrated in (174). The addressee is expressed as the A argument of the
minor verb la ‘be.MD’ and major verbs we ‘leave’ and me ‘come’. The speaker expresses
his lack of understanding why the addressee just keeps walking around:
(174) a

we la
me do, a
nala tahai?
2SG be.MD leave be.MD come PRX 2SG what search
‘you, you only go and come, so what are you searching?’[B05.033.03]In fact the minor verb la ‘be.MD’ indicates that the reported event is performed outside
the deictic centre, and ‘autonomously’ of speaker’s intention and awareness of its
reason; however, this construction can be analyzed as realis marking strategy as it
confirms that the event is truly happening. This is illustrated in (175) where (A) inquires
whether (B) is already asleep. (B) uses la ‘be.MD’ to express that he is unable to sleep.
He says that he is just lying ‘there’, while he is in the same location with the speaker.","[426, 427, 428]"

In sum, all Abui indigenous consonants occur as word medial onsets. Except for the
nasal velar [ŋ], all consonants occur also word initially. The coda position is relatively
more restricted than the onset position. Only eight consonants are allowed in wordfinal coda position: /t, k, m, n, ŋ, r, l, j/. The word-medial coda position is even more
restricted, as it allows only five consonants: /k, m, n, ŋ, r/. There is a clear asymmetry
in the distribution of /j/ and /w/. The glide /j/ occurs as coda while /w/ does not
occur as coda. A similar asymmetry is also found among liquids, as the liquid /r/ is
found in word-medial codas across the lexicon, while the liquid /l/ is only found in
word-medial coda position in complex verbs.","[57, 58]"

Open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed grammatical categories
are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers, adverbs, and question
words. There is a closed set of generic verbs which are monosegmental roots and have
a number of grammatical functions in argument realization and verb derivation.
NOUNS. Abui nouns are only identified unambiguously by their referential properties
when they have animate referents. Inanimate nouns are typically underspecified for
number, shape, or size; in other words, their reference is generic. Many lexical items are
categorially indetermined and may refer to objects and substances as well as to events.
Abui nouns are divided in two groups by possessive inflection. Inherently
possessed nouns require possessive inflection. Semantically these are body parts and
kinship terms. This distinction is illustrated in (3), where the bound nominal stem min
‘nose’ combines with the inalienable possessive prefix na- (1SG.INAL). In (b), the noun
fala ‘house’ belongs to the second group of optionally possessed nouns. The possessive
prefix ne- (1SG.AL) marks the alienable possession. In third person, the possessor is
optionally expressed with a noun that precedes the possessum denoting noun, as
illustrated in (c).

(PROPOSS), with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives
(DEICT), modifier nouns (NMOD), stative verbs (V), adjectives (ADJ), quantifiers (QUANT),
and anaphoric demonstratives (DEM) in a fixed order, as illustrated in (4).
(4)NP Æ(DEICT) (NPOSS PROPOSS-) N (NMOD) (ADJ/V) (QUANT) (DEM)Optionally, an NP may be modified by a modifier linked to the head noun with the
linker ba (LNK); typically, a relative clause (RC). The linked modifier may either precede
or follow the head noun as illustrated in (5). It forms a single intonational unit with the
modified NP. In (a), the modifier clause precedes the head noun bataa ‘wood’. In (b),
the modifier clause follows the head noun. The second order is more common.

Controlling and volitional participants of an event are identified as actors. Actors are
realized as A arguments with NPs and/or free pronouns. This is illustrated in (6). In (a),
the A argument is expressed with the NP maama ‘father’ and the free pronoun di (3A);
in (b), the A argument is expressed by the free pronoun di (3A).

arguments with NPs and/or bound pronouns. This is illustrated in (7). In (a), the U
argument is expressed with the NP wil ‘child’ and with the bound pronoun ho(3II.REC). In (b), the U argument is expressed with the bound pronoun no- (1SG.REC).

1SG.REC-hot-be.at
‘I feel hot’There are three sets of bound pronouns that express arguments with a specific
reference. Their distribution is determined by the semantic features of the participantsINTRODUCTION15such as [±change of state] and [±individuated]. In (8), the U argument of the verb loi
‘put far, chase’ is realized in a number of constructions.

‘Simon chases me’DISTR.REC-3II.PAT-put.farIn (a), the U argument nala nuku ‘something’ is co-indexed as LOC; it has a specific
non-individuated referent that must be understood in a very broad sense as ‘purpose’ or
‘reason’. In (b), the same U argument is co-indexed as REC; its referent is
[+individuated] and probably a human or some other clearly distinguished referent. In
(c), the U argument kaai ‘dog’ is affected by the event chasing, and effectively chased
away. While in (a) and (b) the meaning of the verb loi was translated as ‘bark’, the
translation ‘chase’ is more appropriate in (c). As illustrated in (d), the use of the PAT
bound pronoun is not felicitous to refer to first and second person participants.
Instead, the benefactive serial construction with the generic verb l ‘give’ must be used.
The first person participant is expressed as the U argument of the verb l ‘give’. Note
that the verb loi ‘put far’ combines with two bound pronouns. The distributive form
to- (DISTR.REC) refers to a plural number of participants that are ‘recipients’ of chasing.
The PAT form ha- (3II.PAT) indicates that a single participant is chased. The first person
prefix may not appear here. The combinations of prefixes in double U transitive
constructions are restricted.
Depending on its semantic properties a single participant of an event may be
expressed as different types of arguments of the same verb. In (9), the single participant
of the event of ‘leaving (towards a DC)’ is expressed as actor (a), experiencer (b), and
undergoer (c).

events with distinct telic properties. There are three basic distinctions made depending
on the inner temporal structure of the event. Inceptive stems (ICP) indicate events that
have an initial point. Completive stems (CPL) indicate events that have a final point.
Continuative stems (CNT) indicate events that are viewed as having neither initial nor
final point.

Consider also the distinction between (b) and (c). While (b) refers to a person that is

(LNK) is not present; consequently, both constructions have a different reading. In (c),
the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) follows the verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’. The
demonstrative is not interpreted as an adnominal modifier because the verb dakun-i
‘become dirty’ is not embedded but predicates over the NP ya palata ‘cold water’. For
the clause level functions of anaphoric demonstratives see section 6.4.3.

meting ‘betel nut and betel vine’ is logically the U argument of the verb mi ‘take’ but in

[B01.079.02:01]In (112) a complex structure serves as the U argument of the verb tahai ‘search’. In this
structure, the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the bare NP kafiei ‘goat’ with the relative
clause nai-d-i nu ‘became lost (some time ago)’. Note that the head noun kafiei ‘goat’ is
the single argument of the verb nai-d- ‘get lost’.

[B07.013.01]In (113), the bare NP fe ‘pig’ combines with a relative clause. Observe that the head
noun fe ‘pig’ is co-indexed as the possessor of the noun toku ‘leg’ in the relative clause.
The noun toku ‘leg’ serves as the U argument of the verb kor ‘bind’. The A argument
of the verb kor ‘bind’ is not expressed. Note that the relativized NP fe ‘pig’ is coindexed with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL) and PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT) inside the

which it shares its U argument fala ‘house’. The A argument of the verb ong ‘make’ is
tayoka ‘earthquake’.

‘that house that was destroyed by the earthquake, people are again repairing it’In (115), one of the most complex structures found in my corpus is given. The NP
headed by fala ‘house’ contains a possessor e-maama mantan kades ‘your father,
former village head’. This NP is linked with a large relative clause given between curly172CHAPTER IVbrackets. The example comes from a conversation concerning the place name Fota
Ailol. The name refers to a place with a large wide stone that used to be a resting place
in the old days. The speaker described the stone as being located with respect to the
house of the addressee’s uncle. He refers to the house as standing below a big and wide
stone like this.

[B02.127.01:35]From the previous examples, we can conclude that the linker ba (LNK) links an NP and
a modifier in a structure that functions as single NP. In fact, this definition can be
expanded also to the clause level, as the linker ba (LNK) serves to link verbs in a single
clause (see also section 3.5.6). The linked ba (LNK) has an intersective function; it links
two constituents to a single unit on the level of one of them.
In the complex NPs given so far, the NP precedes the linker ba (LNK) linking it
with a modifier constituent (adnominal modifier or a clause). The modified NP may be
considered as the head of the construction. However, in some cases, the modifying
constituent precedes the noun or the noun may be omitted. The modifier constituent
has either deictic or possessive function and its location corresponds to the location of
deictics and possessors within the NP. In (116), the relative clause nopa mia ‘be
touching on me’ precedes the NP bataa do ‘the wood’. The linker ba (LNK) follows the
clause. In (b), the expected constituent order is given which is also attested.

people’. The relative clause is external and it precedes its head ama ‘person’ because its
function is deictic; its structure is parallel to that of an NP. As discussed above, deictic
modifiers precede the head noun in the NP.

ama ‘person’ is not expressed but its expected position is marked with ∅ following the
relative clause. Because the head is not expressed intersective linker ba (LNK) follows
the quantifier loku (PL). The complex NP serves as argument for the index verb n-u ‘be
like.PRX’. It seems that the relative clause precedes the head because it is deictic.

[B06.038.05:20]In (119), a complex construction is given where an NP headed by the noun he-kalieta
‘old person’ combines with the noun Kafola that expresses the possessor of the noun
kalieta ‘old person’ referring to the area where the old person comes from. It precedes
the NP and is linked with ba (LNK). The NP contains an embedded relative clause
marked with curly brackets. The evidence that this relative clause is embedded comes
from the position of the numeral nuku ‘one’, which follows the relative clause but
quantifies the noun kalieta ‘old person’. The relative clause he-tafaa do ayoku fala mi-a
‘his two drums are in the house’ is not linked to the head kalieta ‘old person’ with the
linker ba (LNK) as expected. One possibility is that it is omitted in the fast speech (this is
a fragment of a conversation); another possibility is that the possessive prefix he(3II.AL) that links the noun tafaa ‘drum’ to the possessor kalieta ‘old person’ is
sufficient.

[B06.041.10:49]In (120), the relative clause el adat he-ì is linked with ba (LNK) to the NP nala nu ‘those
things’. The relative clause precedes the NP because it expresses a possessor. The verb ì
‘put’ is often used in Abui to express possession (see also 8.4.2.7).

‘you should agree on those!’[B13.012.38:14]However, when the possessor expressed in the relative clause is inanimate, the relative
clause is not fronted. This is illustrated in (121), where the relative clause mi=ng tanga
he-ì do follows the NP nala ‘something’. This structure describes a mobile phone as a
thing that one uses for speaking (with other people).

‘Simon looked at the mobile phone and he did not understand it’[B10.048.02]The examples (116)-(121) suggest that the location of the modifiers linked with ba
(LNK) with respect of the NP sometimes follows the NP template. Modifiers that
denote spatial position or possessor may precede the NP linked to them with ba (LNK).
Although semantically, the NP functions as the head of the structure, the headedness of
structures with ba (LNK) is problematic on the syntactic level, because the relative clause
or other linked modifier appears in two positions.
Den Dikken (2006) presents an interesting cross-linguistic account of similar
structures that contain a linker and argues that it is actually the linker that is the ‘head’
of these structures. The other functions of ba seem to support this analysis (see 3.5.6).
The linker ba (LNK) probably originates in the verb ba ‘say’ that is grammaticalized to
an affirmative marker (6.4.2.1). The form ba is sometimes used as a copula, as
illustrated in (122). In (a), ba occurs as final constituent and serves as an optional
copula. Because the NP complement kaai ‘dog’ of the copula clause is itself a verb (the
stative verb kika ‘be red’) a copula is not necessary. However, the linking function of ba
is contrasted in (b), where it is grammaticalized to a relator glossed here as (LNK).

there is no copula that links the nominal predicate with its argument. An example ofNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES175nominal predication is given in (123). In (a), the bare NP kalieta ‘old person’ serves as
nominal predicate. In (b), the NP moku fila ‘small child’ predicates over Fan Malei.

This is illustrated in (126) where the index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ links the nominal
predicate with the NP Simon ayoku ‘two Simons’. The construction is contrasted with
nominal predicative construction in (b).

[Note.005.01]While the index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ typically occurs between the arguments, the
index verb wi-d- ‘be like.MD’ usually follows both NPs. This is illustrated in (128),176CHAPTER IVwhere the NPs Jakarta do ‘Jakarta’ and Takalelang fila ‘small Takalelang’ precede the
verb wi-d- ‘become like that’.

Typically it is followed by an intonational pause, marked here with a comma.

that refer to kind. The NPs neng loku ‘men’ and mayol loku ‘women’ are the

In this chapter, I discuss Abui argument realization. Event participants are realized as
different arguments of a verb with NPs and/or pronouns. The choice of the
appropriate realization is determined by the semantic properties of the participant. This
is discussed in section 5.1. The controlling and volitional participants are identified for
the actor (A) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or free pronouns. The affected
participants are identified for the undergoer (U) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or
bound pronouns. The listed criteria apply to arguments in both transitive and
intransitive constructions.
The choice between a pronoun and an NP is determined by the referential
properties of the participant. In section 5.2, I show that arguments with a specific
reference are expressed with pronouns and optional NPs; arguments with a nonspecific reference are expressed with NPs. In section 5.3, I discuss the A arguments
that are expressed with free pronouns. In section 5.4, the U arguments expressed with
bound pronouns are described. There are three distinct sets of bound pronouns that
may express the U arguments. As discussed in section 5.5, the choice of a bound
pronoun is determined by the semantic properties of the participants such as
[±individuated] and [±change of state]. In section 5.6, I focus on the U argument in
transitive constructions. I illustrate multiple ways in which the U argument can be
expressed. In section 5.7, the argument realization in intransitive constructions is
discussed. The single participant of the intransitive verb may be realized as the A or U
argument. In section 5.8, I present a diachronic analysis of the bound pronouns.
Finally, in section 5.9 an overview of the argument realization is given.","[192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200]"

participants. The CV w-a-k is related to the CV w-o-k ‘throw’. The U argument of the
CV w-a-k is the NP ni-ya maama o ‘mother and father’. The verb refers to
‘abandoning’ of parents by their children.

prefix ta- (DISTR.PAT). It refers to ‘embracing’ of two participants. This is encoded as a
motion away from the DC. The root w ‘leave’ indicates the remote locus. Because both
participants are affected they are co-indexed as patients on the CV.

[B02.087.08:17]As illustrated in examples above, the CVs such as w-a-k or l-a-k present quite
descriptions of events from a perspective that is radically different from that of more
familiar languages. The paradigms suggest that the question of lexicalization cannot be
answered without intensive further research.
Some more paradigms of the CVs with alternating first root are given below. In
(127), the root m ‘be in’ encodes the event locus as being in the same location.

caused. The root u ‘leave’ refers to the event that reached its final boundary and has
persistent effect. The initial roots encode the locus. As discussed in the initial part of
this section, the root f ‘sever’ refers to the separation locus of two participants. The
root k ‘bring’ refers to locus that is not in reach but not too remote. The root r ‘reach’
refers to the locus where participants were previously in ‘in reach or fixed’ of each
other. Finally, the root t ‘lie’ refers to horizontal locus of the participants.

with two arguments. The A argument is expressed with the free pronoun di (3A). The U
argument is the NP de-namang ‘her own clothes’ and co-indexed with the prefix ha(3II.PAT) as patient on the CV. It corresponds to the English verb ‘take off’ because it
combines with the argument ‘clothes’.

‘Simon unties the goat’[B07.042.02]A number of CVs that alternate the first root is given in (131). These CVs refer to a
motion event oriented away from the DC. The root u ‘leave’ indicates that the event
reached its final boundary and persists. As in the previous cases, the root b ‘join’ refers
to an intersection locus, the root f to separation locus. The root k ‘bring’ indicates the
out-of-reach locus that is not remote. It contrasts with the root l ‘give’ that refers to inreach locus. The root t ‘lie’ refers to horizontal locus.

‘true’. Their function is inverted negation. There are two affirmative predicate markers
in Abui: ba and bai (discussed in 6.4.2.1 and 6.4.2.2). Both items are identified as verbs,
because they may combine with person and aspectual inflection. Both markers are
related, in fact they are a grammaticalization of the verb ba ‘say’ which is used when
direct speech is quoted, as illustrated in (222) where the verb ba ‘say’ follows a direct
speech and combines with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC).15

3II.LOC-say[B02.045.16:09]This verb has developed, next to its affirmative functions, also to a relator, complement
marker, and an intersective linker in both nominal and verbal domain (see also 3.5.6
and 4.5).16
6.4.2.1
Affirmative predicate marker ba
The affirmative predicate marker ba ‘say’ affirms the true value of a predicate. Its use is
illustrated in (223). The marker ba ‘say’ indicates that the child that is described as
‘shivering’ in the preceding clause perhaps ‘is’ ill. The first clause expresses the topic of
the predicate, which is expressed in the second clause. Structurally, the construction
reminds of the copula clauses given in section 4.5, example (122).

‘the child over there is shivering, it is perhaps ill’
[B05.060.04]In (224), the marker ba ‘say’ follows the index verb na ‘be like.PRX’. Also this structure
is related to the copula clauses mentioned above. However, as the complement itself is
verbal, the verb ba ‘say’ has acquired the affirmative function.

‘it is so’[na]complementbacopula/affirmative markerbe.like.PRX.CNTsay[B09.003.03:02]A fragment from a negotiation is given in (225). The affirmative marker ba is used in
both conversation turns. One of the participants inquires whether the solicitors ‘will’
start bargaining. One solicitor answers that they ‘do’ intend to do so.
In this function, ba is translated with the Malay verb bilang ‘say’, which is the motivation of the gloss.
Cross-linguistically, copulas may acquire the affirmative function and even develop to a nominalising device
with possible extensions as complementizer or relator (cf. LaPolla, 2007:10).

[B13.012.38:06]In (226), ba ‘say’ occurs twice in the same sentence. The first ba ‘say’ introduces a
conditional clause: naha ba ‘if not’. The second ba ‘say’ indicates that it is true that
there are evil ghosts, if one does not sleep elsewhere.

[B02.126.00:42]The affirmative marker ba ‘say’ often occurs in constructions that report events or
speech that was not witnessed by the addressee. A number of examples are given in
(227). In these constructions, ba ‘say’ follows the VP in the complement clause of the
utterance verb fanga/fangi ‘say, speak, utter’.

[B07.010.02]Note that in (227) the affirmative predicate marker ba ‘say’ is followed by the anaphoric
demonstrative yo (MD.AD). For more details about the use of anaphoric demonstratives
in the clause domain see section 6.4.3. In (228), the speaker reports his dream, in which
he went to the harbour Kalabahi. In the dream reality, the speaker refers to himself as
to his ‘spirit’ and stresses the true value of his dream report with the affirmative marker
ba ‘say’.

Confirmative predicate marker bai
The marker bai confirms the true value of a predicate. The marker bai consists of the
marker ba ‘say’ that is inflected with the perfective suffix -i (PFV). The marker bai is
used to persuade the addressee of true value of the predication. Consider the fragment
in (229). The speaker is requested to shoot with the bow. He complains about the fact
that his arm ‘does’ already hurt.

[B09.002.00:48]In (230), the confirmative marker bai occurs twice. In the second clause, the marker bai
proves its verbal character when it combines with the aspectual marker te (INCP.C). The
first occurrence of the confirmative marker ba-i (say-PFV) indicates the true value of the
clause ‘I just told it to you’. The form bai serves as a copula, as it takes the first clause
as its topic, while the copula complement is expressed by the second clause.

cases, the demonstratives follow the head constituent of an NP or a clause. Their
function is anaphoric (compare the deictic function in 6.3.2). All six anaphoric
demonstratives that occur as adnominal modifier may also combine with a VP (see
3.5.2.2). In (233), an overview of the demonstratives and their functions is given. In the

(section 6.4.3.5)
(section 6.4.3.6)The anaphoric demonstrative indicates the discourse location of the referred event
when it is followed by another phrase or clause. It indicates the location of the event
with respect to the moment of speech (temporal location) when it is the final
constituent of a sentence. Clauses with anaphoric demonstratives as their final
constituent may express complements. The anaphoric demonstrative has nominalising
effect and clearly delimits the domain of a clause. As there are no pivots for crossclause reference, the arguments within the clause delimited with an anaphoric
demonstrative are not necessarily accessible for the pronominal reference of the
following clause (this feature will be illustrated in 6.4.3.1). The use of the anaphoric
demonstratives in different domains is attested also in other Papuan languages
(Reesink, 1994). The anaphoric demonstratives have been analysed as having a domain
creating function and marking different types of constructions.
6.4.3.1
Anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX)
The anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) indicates the temporal location of an event as
proximate to the moment of speech when it is the final constituent of a sentence, such
as in (234). The demonstrative do (PRX) combines with the verb -yei ‘fall’ to indicate
that the event of ‘falling’ just occurred.

are discussed in section 7.2.1 and exemplified in (30)-(38), where I gloss the form tak as
‘empty’. The meaning shifts illustrated in (68) may obscure the derivation path. To
avoid confusion and discussion elsewhere in this book, I use the simplified glossing
instead of the full glosses given in this section.
In this analysis, I take the conservative view that the segments of a verb can
only be analysed as morphemes when there is positive evidence to do so. A
morphologically complex verb that is composed of GVs will only be identified as such
under the strict condition that it occurs in a paradigm with other complex verbs which
shows a minimal contrast in form coupled to a systematic contrast in meaning. This is
why the paradigms discussed below are crucial. There are also many Abui verbs that do
not show systematic form/ meaning contrast with other verbs (see 3.4.4). It may be
that such verbs are morphologically simple forms, but it may also be that some of them
are derived forms whose semantics have shifted so much over time that there is no
evidence of their former morphological composition.
In 7.3.1, the CVs consisting of two generic roots are discussed. My data covers
the best the homogenous CVs that consists of three generic roots. This substantial
subtype is discussed in section 7.3.2. The CVs that consist of more than three generic
roots are discussed in section 7.3.3.","[342, 343]"

Phasal aspect markers si (PHSL.I) and ti (PHSL.C)
The phasal aspect marker si (PHSL.I) refers to the point just after the start of an event.
The marker ti (PHSL.C) indicates the point right after an event has finished. Both
markers are formally related to the inceptive markers. In fact, the inceptive and phasal224CHAPTER VImarkers have reversed functions: inceptive markers refer to the point just before, while
phasal markers refer to the point just after. In (46), both phasal markers are contrasted.

‘she did not go to fetch water, (but) went to prod some banana blossom’[B02.027.04:19]The fragment from the narrative moku ayoku is continued in (244). The last clause
from (243) is resumed as the initial part of the clause chain. Note that the NP baleei
wataka ‘banana blossom’ that is introduced in the first clause is also the implicit U
argument of the verb mi ‘take’.

‘and went to assist the (other) woman to give birth’[B02.027.04:24]The presented examples (242)-(244) show two instances of tail-head linkage, which is
used frequently in Abui narratives (see texts in Appendix for more examples). Tail-head
linkage is a typical feature of many Papuan languages (cf. De Vries, 2005).
6.4.3.2
Anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD)
The anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) used as final constituent of a sentence
indicates the proximate temporal location of the referred event with respect to the
addressee. This means that the speaker presents new information to the addressee as if
he already knows about it. An example is given in (245). This is a fragment from the
narrative moku ayoku which is a story of two orphans. A part of the story was given in
(242)-(244). Here a blind woman is cheated by another woman. Her baby is stolen and
she is presented a banana blossom and blamed as a witch that cannot bear proper
human beings. When the husband returns home and asks about the baby that was born
while he was away, the blind woman gives him the following answer:
(245) baleei wataka

‘I just gave birth to some banana blossom’to
PRX.AD
[B02.029.05:30]VERB PHRASE AND CLAUSE287In the previous example, the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) referred to an event
that occurred in the past. In (246), the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) refers to an
event that is about to occur. The completive stem of the verb aisa/aisi ‘urinate’ does
not indicate the past but expresses the event of ‘peeing’ is viewed as having a final
point.
(246) Q: wah, a

go-IPFVto!oh 1SG urinate.CPL PRX.AD
‘ah, I am just going to pee’[B06.082.04:02]In (247), the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) occurs in sentence-medial position. It
indicates the location of ‘telling a story’ as proximate to ‘laughing’. This construction is
uttered as an instruction how to tell a story that is going to be recorded. The speaker
chooses the perspective of the addressee, as he is not participating in the event.

PRH
[B06.039.07:03]The addressee oriented anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) expresses speaker’s
empathy with the addressee. This is again illustrated in (248), where the anaphoric
demonstrative to (PRX.AD) combines with the particle doma ‘no’ to negate the request
presented in the first line.

[B09.004.04:19]6.4.3.3
Anaphoric demonstrative o (MD)
The anaphoric demonstrative o (MD) indicates a medial (less proximate) temporal
location of an event. It is usually used to refer to events that occurred some time ago, as
illustrated in (249).
(249) Fani, sameng ba, Pak Kas di mi ba
Takpala
name cement say Mr. name 3A take LNK place
‘Fani, the cement, Mr. Karsten brought it up to Takpala’maran-iocome.up.CPL-PFV MD
[Sms.01.03]288CHAPTER VIIn (250), the anaphoric demonstrative o (MD) is used in sentence-medial positions. It
indicates that the reported event preceded the event reported by the second phrase or
clause. The complement clause in (a) is embedded because the A argument of the verb
ién ‘see’ in the matrix clause is fronted to the focus position. The clause neng di do-làk
‘the man returned’ expresses a complement of the verb ién ‘see’ which is co-indexed
with the pronominal prefix h- (3II.PAT). Note that the A argument of the verb làk ‘leave
for’ cannot be cross-referenced as the A argument of the verb ién ‘see’ in the matrix
clause. This example provides the evidence of the lack of pivots for cross-clausal
coreference in Abui. The complement clause in (a) can be also analyzed as an internal
relative clause. In (b), the same event is expressed. This is an instance of a paratactic
complement clause (cf. Noonan, To appear: 14-6). The complement clause is not
embedded. In (c), a similar meaning is expressed in a construction with again a different
structure containing a relative clause. Note that the anaphoric demonstrative o (MD)
occurs as the final constituent in the relative clause do-làk o.

Anaphoric demonstrative yo (MD.AD)
The anaphoric demonstrative yo (MD.AD) indicates the medial (less proximate) temporal
location of the referred event from addressee’s perspective. It is usually used to draw
addressee’s attention to a new piece of information. In (251), a piece of a dialogue is
given. The grandfather is about to teach his grandson how to shoot with a long bow.
The grandmother asks about what they will be shooting at. The anaphoric
demonstrative yo (MD.AD) refers to the temporal location of shooting in future.

This book is a description of Abui, a Papuan language spoken on Alor Island in eastern
Indonesia. It presents essential parts of Abui grammar in a theoretically neutral way.
This chapter contains some general information about Abui, its speakers and the
area in which Abui is spoken. This chapter is organised in the following fashion. The
geographic position of the area where Abui is spoken is defined in section 1.1. The
genetic affiliation of Abui, together with a brief overview of the historical sources
concerning Alor Island and Abui people, is discussed in section 1.2. In section 1.3 I
give some general information about the Abui community, the number of speakers,
their typical occupation and way of living. The linguistic situation of the area where
Abui is spoken is described in section 1.4. Information about the contexts in which
Abui is used and about language endangerment will also be included in this section. In
section 1.5 I give an overview of previous linguistic efforts focused on Abui; and in 1.6
I discuss Abui genetic affiliation. I present a typological sketch of Abui in section 1.7.
Section 1.8 discusses how the language data was collected. It describes the fieldwork
and gives some basic information about the language consultants. Section 1.9 deals with
composition of the corpus and gives a list of recorded texts that are included in it.
Section 1.10 gives an outline of this book and introduces the conventions in which the
language data will be presented.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"46CHAPTER I1.6Genetic affiliationAbui is classified as belonging to the Timor-Alor-Pantar branch of the Trans-New
Guinea (TNG) family (Capell, 1969; Stokhof, 1975; 1984; Pawley, 1998:655; 2001;
Ross, 2005:22-4; Gordon, 2005). The majority of languages spoken in the Alor-Pantar
area belong to same branch of the TNG family. 5 TNG languages extend over the
mountainous area of New Guinea, but also in the northern and southern lowlands; and
as far as the Timor-Alor-Pantar area, where Abui belongs (see Map 1).6 It is unclear
when speakers of TNG languages arrived in the Timor-Alor-Pantar area, but is very
likely that it was before the Austronesians (cf. Klamer et.al., In press).
In general, most linguists agree that there is a possible connection between the
development of taro and other root crop agriculture in New Guinea 6,000-9,000 years
ago and the initial dispersal of TNG languages (cf. Foley, 1986:275-277; Pawley, 1998:
655; Ross 2005:41-42). Ross (2005:42) argues, that the mountainous east-central region
of New Guinea is probably the place of origin of TNG languages, as the diversity
found there is greatest and may coalesce with the area of taro domestication. As one
proceeds towards the periphery, the diversity decreases. Ross further speculates, that
the extreme of the West TNG linkage in Timor, Alor, and Pantar may represent a
relatively late TNG settlement. However, it is probable that the speakers of TNG
languages reached the area before the Austronesian migration that occurred by mid
third millennium BC.
Ross (2005:36) groups the Timor-Alor-Pantar languages, and the languages of
Bomberai Peninsula of the Bird’s Head together with the western part of the main
mountain chain into a so called ‘West Trans New Guinea linkage’. He argues that the
group resulted from an earlier dialect chain rather than from a single protolanguage.
Languages assigned membership in the Trans-New Guinea family (TNG) show
systematic resemblance in the pronominal system and regular sound correspondences
in their basic vocabulary, of which about two hundred etyma have been reconstructed
so far (cf. Pawley, 2005-b). There are alternative groupings of Papuan languages (cf.
Foley, 1986) and some linguists are reserved about the extension of the TNG family.
As mentioned above, the membership in the TNG family is established by a set
of free pronouns. The reconstructed proto-TNG pronouns (cf. Ross, 2005:29) and
corresponding Abui forms are listed in Table 1.","[28, 29]"

quality of the stressed vowels is affected. As illustrated in (97), the mid front vowel /ɛ/
followed by the velars [k, ŋ] is lowered, slightly lengthened, and pronounced as the
diphthong [ɛɑ] when under stress. The ‘breaking’ of /ɛ/ does not occur in slow and
careful speech.

prefixes fit the iambic pattern of the word as illustrated in the following examples:

e-kaala/ʔɛ’kaːlɑ/‘your pudding (sweet pudding from corn)’2SG.AL-puddingAspectual markers are light syllables (or single vowels) that form a prosodic word with
the verb. As illustrated in (100), the verbs tukon ‘cut’ and marang ‘come up’ consist of
two light syllables stressed in iambic pattern. When these verbs are inflected for aspect
the stress moves to the final syllable and is placed on the clitic.

pronominal prefixes from set III (see section 3.3.2) that contain the vowel [ɑ], the
vowel [ɑ] is deleted and the consonant segment of the prefix becomes the word-initial
onset of the inflected word. A number of cases are illustrated in (101).

extrametrical syllable. Bimoraic nuclei are heavy and attract stress. In (102) an overview
of disyllabic prosodic words is given, containing words with the common iambic
pattern (a-c) and with an iambic foot with an extrametrical syllable in (d):

/tɑ’dɪɛlɑŋ/The extrametricality is triggered by a heavy syllable in penultimate position. As the

words with a complex rime in non-final syllables such as mang’mat ‘adopted child’,
ran’ta ‘villain’, kon’rek ‘stick’ or tukang’rek ‘stick’ are morphologically complex words.","[83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88]"

Person inflection and valence of bound verb stems
In this section, I show how person inflection and valence vary in a number of VPs
headed by bound verb stems such as -yei ‘fall’, -rik ‘hurt’, and -loi ‘put far’.
In the VPs exemplified in (77)-(81), the bound verb stem yei ‘fall’ occurs as the
head verb. In (77), the VP contains the PAT pronominal prefix ha- (3II.PAT) that
expresses the U argument. The pronoun refers to the NP moku fila ‘small child’. The 3I
prefix da- (3I.PAT) cannot combine with the verb -yei ‘fall’ as the event of ‘falling’ is
never controlled by the affected participant.

[B07.059.02]232CHAPTER VIAs illustrated in (78), a VP headed by -yei ‘fall’ cannot combine with an A argument.
The first person actor is realized as the A argument of the verb ong ‘make’ with the free
pronoun na (1SG) as in (62) ong ha-mong ‘cause to die’.
(78)nayambukongha-yei1SG glass

‘I dropped a glass’[B04.053.01]In (79), the verb -yei ‘fall’ combines with two prefixes in a UREC-UPAT transitive

‘piece of wood’ while the REC prefix o- (2SG.REC) refers to the human goal of the

construction must be used, as illustrated in (81), where the verb -yei ‘fall’ combines
with a U argument expressed with the third person prefix ha- (3II.PAT). The first person
undergoer is specified as the malefactive with the LOC prefix ne- (1SG.LOC) attached to

contains two pronominal prefixes and in both cases also an aspectual marker. In both
cases, the VP combines with two U arguments. There is no third argument slot. The
evidence for this claim comes from both examples below. The actor participant that
will cause that the flies are chased is cast as the A argument of the verb me ‘come’.4

above. The verb -loi ‘put far, chase’ is serialized with the verb -l ‘give’ to disambiguate
who is acting upon whom (see also 8.4.2.4). The benefactive serial verb construction
also implicates, that the chasing was not performed with the full control of the

[B05.077.04]In (91), three VPs contain each two pronominal prefixes. In all cases, the REC prefix
occurs further from the verb stem. The bound stems -baai ‘be angry’ and -l ‘give’ have
the LOC prefix attached immediately to the stem. Both stems are used in UREC-ULOC
transitive construction (6.2.3.5) which indicates that the second person singular
participant expressed with the REC prefix o- (2SG.REC) experiences a strong emotion
with respect of the first person singular participant expressed by the LOC prefix ne(1SG.LOC). The verb stem -loi ‘put far, chase’ combines with the verb -l ‘give’ in
benefactive serial construction to express the first person singular undergoer participant
(8.4.2.4).
4 A similar use of the verb ‘come’ is found in Teiwa, where combined with other verbs it may mark future of
intention of a participant to perform an event (Klamer, to appear:ex.48).","[253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"

In this chapter, I give an overview of Abui phonology. In other words, I discuss the
different sounds of the language and how they are combined together. The data
presented in this chapter are from the Takalelang, Alila and Tifol Afeng dialect. In a
small number of cases, data from the Fanating dialect are used. These cases are
explicitly marked.
This chapter is organized as follows: in section 2.1.1, the phonemic inventory of
Abui is discussed. The distribution of the phonemes within words and syllables are
described in 2.2, with subsections for consonants (2.2.1) and vowels (2.2.2). Syllable
structure is described in 2.3 and further referred to in 2.4 where I give an overview of
prosodic word types. In a prosodic word, syllables are stressed following the iambic
pattern (2.5); a penultimate heavy syllable causes the final syllable to be extrametrical
(2.5.3). A small number of Abui word has lexical tone (2.5.4). This chapter ends in 2.6
with an overview of orthographic conventions used in this grammar.","[46, 47, 48]"
"8.2Symmetrical serial verb constructionsThe verbs in symmetrical SVCs (SSVC) belong to unrestricted sets (as already discussed
in 8.1.2). They do not show any dependency in respect of each other. In general, the
linear ordering of the verbs in a SSVC is the same as order of sub-events building up the
reported event. However, the choice of the verbs reporting various sub-events is
conventionalised as an event has to be reported in a culturally and conventionally
accepted way (cf. Bruce, 1988; Pawley, 1991).4
The SSVC is sometimes indicated by the presence of an aspectual marker
between two verbs. In (13) the verb ban ‘carry’ combines with the aspectual marker te
(INCP.C) that is not shared with the verb sei ‘come down’. Both verbs form a SSCV
characterized by its intonational properties.
(13)ban=tesei!carry.CPL=INCP.C
‘bring it down!’come.down.CNT[B02.060.24:01]The borders of a SSVC may be fuzzy, which makes it difficult to determine whether a
SVC is symmetrical, asymmetrical, or hybrid. In (14) the verb me ‘come’ may be
interpreted to be part of two SVCs. It either indicates the direction in which theThis type of SVCs is found in other Papuan languages consisting sometimes of more than five verbs in
languages such as Kalam (Pawley, 1987; 1991; 1993; 2004) or Kobon (Davies, 1984).",[376]

3I.REC-stand.up.CPL-PFVAs discussed in 5.7.3, the A≡UREC experiencer construction can be alternated by
leaving out the free pronoun to encode that participant is performing an event without
volitional involvement. As illustrated in (147), non-human experiencers are typically
expressed with the 3I set of prefixes as controlling but non-volitional participants. As
noted in 3.3.2, some speakers make distinguish two 3I prefixes: do- (3I.REC) alternates
with du- which is used by some speakers with plural reference (3PL.I.REC). A contrast is
given in (149), where in (a) the more common form is given, while in (b) the plural
form du- (3PL.I.REC) is used. Note that the plural form du- shows the same vowel
alternation as other plural REC prefixes.",[281]

‘Fan Malei tied the goat (away)’In (62), I illustrate the distinction between the verbs lák ‘break away, break out’ and
palel ‘strip, pluck down with hand’. In (a), the U argument of the verb lák ‘break away,
break out’ is a complex NP fala ba oro nu he-adua ‘the owner of that house over
there’. The referent of the U argument has to be ‘broken out’ of his house that
collapsed on him. The verb lák ‘break away, out’ may refer to ‘breaking out’ of pigs
from their bamboo cages. It may also refer to ‘breaking away’ of houses during natural
disasters. In (b) the verb palel ‘strip, pluck down with hand’ is used. It typically refers to
breaking of ‘fruits’ or ‘wood’ towards the speaker or DC. In the example below it
combines with the default ‘break’ verb fak in a serial verb construction:92(62)CHAPTER IIIa. falabaoronuhe-aduaho-lákhouse LNK DST SPC.AD 3II.AL-master

the speaker or DC and /k/ and motion away from the speaker or DC observed in (57)
is also found among the impact verbs.
Some impact verbs make distinctions in the manner of impact. The following
verbs make distinction whether there was only one impact, or whether it was repetitive:(63)SINGLE IMPACTITTERATIVE IMPACTkoi‘cut down (once)’tukong‘cut (repeatedly)’bol‘hit’balasa‘beat’tei‘dig’bok ‘dig, poke, perforate, push in’The distinction between a single impact and iterative impact is illustrated in (64). The
verb bok ‘dig, poke’ is used when the ‘digging’ is restricted to one movement. When the
impact movement is repeated the verb tei ‘dig’ is used instead. This verb is also used to
refer to the ‘cultivation’ of fields, or to the fields themselves, as locations of digging:

Posture verbs
Posture verbs refer to postures taken by a participant. The posture verbs taa/tadei ‘lie
(animate)’, it ‘lie (inanimate)’, mit ‘sit’, mihi ‘set (inanimate)’, natet ‘stand up’, nati
‘erect, stand’, tili/tilei ‘hang’ typically occur in intransitive constructions (see 6.2.4).
Some posture verbs prefer an animate participant, while other verbs occur with
inanimate participants. This is illustrated in (65), where the verb nat-i-a ‘stand’ can be
used only to refer to the upright posture of inanimate participants. The verb natet
glossed here as ‘stand up’ refers to the upright posture of animate participants. It may
combine with the generic root d ‘hold’ to refer to achieving of the upright posture.

Utterance verbs
Utterance verbs refer to different types of communicative acts. They are verbs such as
fanga ‘say’, tanga ‘speak’, ananra ‘tell’, ne ‘call’, tahang ‘ask’, moi ‘sound, answer’.

transitive construction, which encodes an involuntary human experiencer of a bodily
state or condition (see 6.2.3.6). In A≡<ULOC>≡UREC experiencer construction the
human experiencer is marked as controlling and volition, as illustrated in (153). The

Alfred Maufani tells how the marriage of his daughter was arranged. First, the betel nut
is sent to the parents of the girl. After they all agree, bride price negotiations are
arranged. Nowadays the young pair already knows each other, but sometimes the
marriage is arranged by the older people, sometimes a special person in the village.
There can be also special motivation, because, the one who manages to organize a
wedding will get a part of the bride price, this is a topic of the bride price discussion.
After the wedding the young woman leaves to the house of her husband. Sons, on the
other hand, stay with their parents.","[460, 461, 462, 463, 464]"

[B07.079.01]Deictic demonstrativesAs adverbial modifiers, deictic demonstratives indicate the location of an event in
space. As discussed in 3.5.2, demonstratives may occur in both the nominal domain and
the verbal domain. In both domains, demonstratives may occur in two syntactic
positions. They either precede or follow the head. In a clause, deictic demonstratives
precede the VP, the anaphoric demonstratives follow it. When the demonstrative
precedes the head verb of a VP, it refers to the location of the event. When it follows
the head verb, it locates the event expressed by the VP in discourse (see also 4.4.3).
In the following examples, I illustrate the use of the deictic demonstratives as adverbial
modifiers. In (180), the deictic demonstrative do (PRX) locates the event ‘here’ by the
speaker.

[B02.033.08:28]6.3.3Predicates functioning as adverbial modifiersThere are a number of predicates (both nominal and verbal) that are used as adverbial
modifiers. These modifiers normally precede the arguments and can be treated as
independent predicates.13 In some cases, they are preceded by one of the arguments.
This is illustrated in (185). The adverbial modifier akun ‘be dark’ is found between the
VP làk ‘leave for’ and its argument ama nu ‘somebody’ in (a). In (b), the verb akun ‘be
dark’ precedes. In that case it is ambiguous and can be treated as a separate clause.

compose the notion of ‘tomorrow morning’; they are literally translated as ‘(it) was
dark, (it) became bright’ and describe the temporal setting of the event of roasting corn.

‘he tries to leave (deliberately)’ [B05.045.01]The single participant is realized as an experiencer as free and bound pronoun with
single reference in (a). In (b) it is expressed only as a free pronoun. The minor verb ra
‘reach, attempt’ expresses speaker’s intention to ‘leave’. The use of the inceptive re
‘reach, try’ is illustrated in (211) where it combines with the verb natet-d-i ‘stand up,

[B05.044.05]The continuative ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ indicates an event as being performed in a
persistent way. The single (human) participant is realized as the U argument with the
PAT prefix. Because the speaker mostly expresses his ‘wish’ to perform an activity, the
free pronoun is omitted and the A≡UPAT experiencer construction is alternated, as
illustrated in (212). In both cases the major verb is inflected with perfective suffix -i
(PFV) although the expressed situation must be considered as an instance of irrealis

[B05.044.03]In negative clauses such as in (213), the verb ra ‘reach’ can be the best translated as
‘still’ and has many similarities with an adverbial modifier. In (a), the item still can be
interpreted as a verb; however, in (b), the predicate dara does not show person
agreement with the A argument na (1SG). The form functions as an adverbial modifier
(see 6.3).

[B07.075.01]The form dara following inanimate participants reminds us of the adverb ‘still’, and
considering the restrictions on the use of the active pronouns with inanimates, it is
likely that the form dara in (214) is adverbial. It is quite obvious that the semantics of
the verb ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ can be easily extended to an adverbial use.","[438, 439]"

subject to the phonotactic restrictions, most frequently occurring phonological shape is
the closed syllable. As discussed in section 7.1.1, Abui closed syllables allow a single
consonant in the coda. This implies that only the consonant roots will be found in the
head position of the CVs that consist of three roots. It implies as well that the derived
CVs will be [±transitive] and occur in both transitive and intransitive constructions.
This is schematically represented in Figure 24.

codaSyntactic structure
Morphological structureSyllable structureFigure 24: Structure of homogeneous CVsThe head position in the coda is available for all the generic verbs, although some
generic roots occur more frequently as heads than others. With respect to the non-head
positions, phonotactic rules restrict the occurrence of the vowel and consonant generic
roots: consonant generic roots only occur as syllable onsets, [-high] vowel generic roots
only as syllable nuclei, [+ high] vowel generic roots as nuclei or coda’s. Therefore,
transitive consonant generic roots are never found in the middle of a derived form.
Abui generic roots refer to motion, locomotion, posture (or location), or impact.
In derivation of CVs, the generic roots referring to motion and locomotion play a
dominant role. The homogeneous CVs that will be discussed in this section are mainly
verbs of motion or locomotion. As illustrated in (74), the CV t-a-k ‘bring down, stop,
empty’ is derived from the CV t-a ‘be on, lie’. The final root describes the type of event
that brings about ‘lying down’.

away from the deictic centre (DC). The derivation of other types of CVs and the
semantics of the final generic roots will be explored in section 7.3.2.1.
In (75), five CVs are given, that alternate their middle root. In all cases the CVs
refer to a motion away from the participant/deictic centre. The middle root expresses
overtly the inner aspect (Aktionsart) of the referred event. The generic root a ‘be at’
encodes an event that is viewed as having no initial or final boundary. The generic root
o ‘point’ encodes that the event is viewed as restricted to a single point. The root i ‘put’
encodes that the event boundary is final. It contrasts with the root e ‘move’ that
indicates an initial event boundary. The root u ‘leave’ indicates that the final boundary
of the event was passed.

7.3.2.2.
Finally, the initial generic root seems to indicate the ‘locus’ of the referred event.
I use the term ‘locus’ to refer to the spatial constellation of the participants. This is
illustrated in (76), where the fist root of each CV refers to the locus of the event. Note
that all events are classified as a motion away from the DC. The location where the
motion ends is indicated with the first generic root. The generic root t ‘lie’ indicates a
horizontal locus; the inceptive root s ‘lie’ indicates a parallel locus. The root w ‘leave’
indicates a remote locus, the root d ‘hold’ refers to a contact locus:

paradigms can be found there.
7.3.2.1
Semantic contribution of the final root
As discussed in sections 7.1.3 and 7.3.2, the final root of a homogeneous CV is the
syntactic head. An additional function of the final root is that is describes the different
types of events, in similar way as the final generic root in heterogeneous CVs discussed
in 7.2. As the set of the generic roots is limited, the generic roots may be analyzed as
‘event classifiers’. Not all of the generic verbs are equally productive as event classifiers.","[343, 344, 345, 346]"

twoAbui verb stems alternate their morphological shape to refer to events that differ in
their internal temporal structure (inner aspect, Aktionsart). I distinguish three stem
types: continuative (CNT), completive (CPL), and inceptive (ICP). For more details about
the aspectual properties of stem types, see 6.1.1.1, where the various types are
exemplified.
As illustrated in (41), for the first type, the coda of the stem is alternated. In all
cases the alternation contrasts the completive (CPL) stem and non-completive
continuative (CNT) or inceptive (ICP) stem. In (42) a number of verbs are given that
alternate the final consonant of the stem.distinct aspectual properties (Foley 1986:146-8). In Telefol some verb stems obligatorily combine with
aspectual suffixes while other do not. In Kiwai, continuative stems must end in non-low vowels e, i, o, u. The
punctiliar stems terminate in low vowel a or in diphthong ai (Foley 1986:147). In Marind (Drabbe 1955)
alternations of the ‘momentary’ and ‘durative’ stems are found. The durative stems end in /ɑ/ and the
momentary stems in a consonant.",[106]
