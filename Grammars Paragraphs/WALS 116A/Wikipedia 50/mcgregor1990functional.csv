"382THE CLAUSE5.4 Remarks on the interpersonal organisation of the clause
5.4.1 Propositional modification
A third aspect of the organisation of the clause is its organisation as an
interactive event, involving the interlocutors in the speech situation. In an
interactive event a clause may be used either: (a) to exchange information, or (b)
exchange 'goods and services' (Halliday 1985:68). (This is something of an
oversimplification, although it is useful as an initial hypothesis - see
McGregor 1988c.) Gooniyandi does not distinguish formally between these two
types of act There is no distinct imperative or any other such related category,
either within the verb phrase or within the clause: e.g. a clause in the future
tense may be used in either way, to exchange information, or to exchange 'goods
and services' (see section 6.5.1 below, and cf. Halliday 1985:68).
Simultaneously, the clause may be used in: (i) giving or offering, and (ii)
requesting or demanding. Again these are not distinguished formally in
Gooniyandi. For example, there is no grammatically distinct class of questions
(as has been mentioned already- see section 5.3.1). Exactly the same forms are
used in eliciting information as in giving information. As we have seen, the
enclitic -mi - -ma (see section 6.3.8) which is frequently found in requests of
confrrmation (i.e. 'yes' or 'no'), and the words ngoonyoo 'something (from a
closed set of options', ngoorndoo 'something', etc. (see 3.3.1.2) frequently found
in information requests (where they mean, respectively 'which' and 'who'), really
mark indefiniteness (cf. Dixon 1977:182ft).
That aspect of the meaning of a clause which remains constant across all of
these functions will be referred to as the PROPOSITIONAL CONTENT of the
clause.
In its role in the exchange of information, the propositional content of a
clause is ASSERTED by the speaker. In the case of requests of information (i.e.
corresponding to WH-questions in English) the propositional content involves
an indefinite in the place of the information requested (cf. pages 369-370 above).
That is, the propositional content of the information request (5-240) above,
jajiwami ngabbiddayi ginharndiyiddingga 'What is it that that pair have eaten?' is
'That pair have eaten something.'
In the case of requests of confirmation, as has already been suggested, the
speaker makes an assertion in the hope that the hearer will respond to it, either
confrrming or denying it. (This may be a reflex of the culturally appropriate
mode of information seeking - including confirmation seeking - which
involves at least the pretence of offering something for comment, elaboration,
etc., rather than direct probing - cf. Eades 1982, McGregor 1988c.) TheINTERPERSONAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE383propositional content of the clause may include the element 'indefinite'. Thus,
ward-ma-wiri (go-IND-you:will:go) has a propositional content 'You are going
(or doing something else)'. This assertion invites a response from the hearer. It
is for this reason that I refer to clauses used in the function of exchange of
infonnation as ASSERTIONS.
It should be noted carefully that I am not suggesting that Gooniyandi people do
not ask questions. This is quite false (for further discussion of this point, see
McGregor 1988c). What I am saying is that grammatically there is no distinct
category of questions; the same forms that are used in making statements are also
used in asking questions. This fact itself may lend some support to Eades'
suggestions as to the differences in the way in which Aboriginal and European
cultures exchange (and view) information. The lack of a distinct category means
that it is always possible for either the speaker or the hearer to use the hedge that
the utterance was in fact a statement pure and simple.","[365, 366, 367]"
"The main deviation from the pattern described here concerns the indefiniteyiniga 'somehow', when it realises the role of Process in a VP (in which case it
has the sense 'do something'), In about a quarter of the available examples, all of
which are elicited, the verbal complex occurs finally and is focal. The problem
here is that the presupposition that something happened is realised linguistically
by the same item that realises the information Focus. The presupposition
therefore can't be set off as given information. What happens in most cases is
that the focal verbal complex is followed by an NP or PP. This phrase
represents given information, the connection between its referent and its
experiential role in the clause. This is the closest possible linguistic
approximation to the presupposition. (5-220) is a typical example.yoowooloo
(5-220) yinigawinmi

What did all those men do?'garndiwangooddoo I
manyThis discussion of information requests may be generalised to questions in
general. In Gooniyandi, requests of confirmation or disconfirmation (polar
yes/no questions) are expressed by the assertion of a proposition, with the
intention and expectation that the hearer's agreement or disagreement will be
elicited. One pan of the proposition, namely the part about which the speaker is
least certain, is selected as the information Focus. The enclitic -mi - -ma IND.
which indicates roughly the same type of indefiniteness as the indefinite
determiners and adverbs, is usually added to the word on which information
Focus falls. Not unusually, especially when it falls on a non-verbal constituent,
the information Focus is marked and there is a presupposition that the process
did occur for at least some entity, place, time, or whatever. A's initial utterance
in (5-221}, for example, presupposes that the person in question did arrive
sometime.
(5-221) A: gaddwaroo bijngarni I
afternoon
he:emerged
B: marlami I jamoondoo bijngarni I
nothing
other:day
he:emerged
A: 'Did he come yesterday?'
B: 'No, he came the other day.'
It may be thought that an interrogative mood might be defmed by the placementTilE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF TilE CLAUSE371of information Focus on the indefmite word in the case of information requests,
and on the word to which -mi - -ma IND is attached in the case of requests of
confirmation. However, this will not work since the Focus can fall on these items
without any suggestion that information or confirmation is being sought - see
line (12) of Text 2, for example.","[354, 355]"
"M angaddi 'not' is also used as an interjection, as a response to both
confirmation (yes-no) and information-seeking questions. In the first case, it
indicates that the asserted proposition is false:
(6-116) A: nginyji joorloo ngoorloogjimi

B: mangaddi nganyi mar/ami ngoodtkxJ -yarndi.

ERG they:drank:it
A: 'You drank with them?'
B: 'No, not me. That other lot (only) drank.'
It seems that mangaddi 'not' is used in this way only in indicating the falsity of
a preceding positive assertion. Otherwise, marlami 'nothing, without' invariably
occurs if the preceding assertion is negative (see next section).
The occurrence of mangaddi 'not' in responses to information probes is
rather unexpected to the English speaker. An example of this use is the
following:(6-117) A: yinigaanggiddaddi
you:pl:are:doing:something
B: mangaddi maa ngabgidda
not
meat we:eat:it
A: 'What are you doing?'
B: 'No( thing), we're eating meat.'",[473]

"(3-22) Q:Here yiniga 'in some/what manner' and miga 'in this/that manner' refer to
complex processes, which could only be described in speech in fairly long texts.
(Incidentally, this probably explains why it was that ""why"" questions I
constructed withjajiyoo (something-DA1) 'what for' were normally answered in
terms of entities: unlike English 'what', the use of jaji 'what' seems to restrict
attention to concrete entities.) The fact that the two words occur in contexts such
as (3-22) justifies their classification as adverbials. (A nominal would have to
occur in an ERG PP in an example like (3-22) where it modified the manner of
action.)
Miga 'in this/that manner' can refer to at least the following:
• manners of action, as in (3-22) above andmuoori
(3-23) miga
like:that he:stands
'He stands like that';
• qualities or attributes of things:
(3-24) miga-jangi mudba

'Don't talk like that';• directions, as in example (3-26):
(3-26) miga(wa) wardhiri
like:that you:will:go
'Go this way.' (usually accompanied by a gesture);
• times when, or conditions under which processes occurred or will occur, for
example:

they:gave:them meat
'After five years have elapsed they give them meat.';and anything conveyed by means of gestures (see example (3-26) above).
Like the three indefinite determiners ngoorndoo 'someone, who'. ngoonyoo
'which' andjaji 'something, what' discussed in section 3.3.1.2, yiniga appears to
occur in both the indefinite sense of 'in some manner' and the interrogative sense
'in what manner, how'. And, as well as referring to manners (as in (3-22)),
yiniga 'in some/what manner' can refer to:
• content of speech, as in:
(3-29) yiniga
JZJagjawoominganggi
some:manner he:should:talk:to:you
'What will he say to you?'; and
• number:
mawoolyi gooddijgoonjoonaddi
(3-30) yiniga
some:manner children
you:hold:them
'How many children have you got?'","[137, 138]"
"(Contrast ngirlijagmingadda (lie he:told:me) 'he told me a lie'.)
In the following example minyjidda 'true' appears to be an NP constituent:
(6-161) minyjidda waddamba bijngarni
true
flood
it:emerged
'A truly big flood came up.'
There is a verbal form minyjiddan- 'believe, take notice of, which is
clearly built on minyjidda 'true' (the final -n is a (perhaps meaningless- but cf.
McGregor forthcoming-d) formative. Examples:
(6-162) nganyi -ngga mangaddi minyjiddangoowaalimi niyaji

I:am:believing:it

'I don't believe it.'
(6-163) nganyi minyjiddangoowaalimi -nganggi

I:am:believing
on:you
'I believe you.', or 'I'm taking notice of you (i.e. of what you are
saying).'
6.4.7 winhi 'just, only'This particle is an expectation modifier which usually translates into English as
'just, only'. (Native speakers, however, preferred to gloss it najing 'nothing' in
their variety of Aboriginal English or Kriol.) It is a clause level counterpart of
the enclitic -moowa 'only, just' (discussed in section 6.3.3), from which it
differs in terms of scope. Whereas the latter modifies speaker's expectations as to
what will fulfil particular roles in the situations referred to, and contains within
its scope constituents of clauses, winhi 'just, only' modifies expectations as to
what situation will occur, and contains full clauses in its scope. Compare for
example, the following pair:504TOPICS IN SEMANTICS(6-164) winhi wardngi thanganuli -yoo
just I:went
wml
DAT
'I only went for a talk.'
(6-165) wardngi thangarndi -yoo -moowa
I:went word
DAT ON
'I went only for a talk.'
In the first example there is an expectation that I might have done something
else; in the second, the expectation is that I might have had some other purpose
in mind in going than just to talk.
The same formula as was invoked in describing -moowa 'only, just'
(section 6.3.3), Assertion x <Expectation y, accounts for the meaning of winhi
'just, only'. Here x andy are different, however: they are situations, rather than
participants or manners, etc .. That is, winhi 'just, only' evaluates the situation
asserted as occurring as 'less than' the situation expected to occur. Only the
scalar sense (see above page 475) of 'less than' is possible here; the subset
reading clearly cannot apply. Depending on the way the relation 'is less than' is
understood, winhi 'just, only' may contextualise in a few different ways, at least
from an Anglo-centric perspective.
(a) The occurring situation may be evaluated as less potent in some sense
than the expected situation. Thus:winhi milayiddarni
(6-166) mangaddi jijaggiddarni
not
we:talk:together only we:look:at:one:another
We're not talking together; we're only looking at one another.'
(Here of course the second clause replaces the first (see section 5.6.2.1). The
expectation that we might be interacting in some way, such as talking is created
by the larger context (e.g. of culture), and obviously not by the immediately
preceding clause. This remark applies to the following, and a number of other
examples.)
In this sense, winhi 'just, only' is frequently followed by the enclitic
-moowa 'only', which perhaps intensifies its effect:
(6-167) wambawoo gardnginbinirni
winhi -moowa
nearly
he:might:have:hit:me only
ON
madnginmi
he:swiped:at:me
'He tried to hit me, but only swiped me.'
(b) In a very closely related sense, the evaluation is not so much on a scaleClAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVBRBIALS505of 'potence', but of the DEGREE to which the situation affects an undergoer. In
the following example, the person referred to is asserted as not being as sick as
might have been expected:nyamani winhi yalijmi
(6-168) mangaddi gambi
not
sickness big
only he:is:sick
'He's not very sick, just a little off-colour.'
Clearly this sense merges in with (a).
(c) The asserted occurrence may be evaluated as less than expectation
because the actor is not serious in his engagement in the process. For example,
(6-169) winhi rooddijginya
mangaddi minyjidda
only I:am:yelling:at:you not
true
'I'm just yelling at you, not seriously.'
(d) The evaluation may rest on an expectation of responsibility of the actor
- that s/he acts with purpose or intent. In this case, the use of winhi 'just,
only' suggests that the action was done without reason.winhi
(6-170) yaabja yoowooloo wardjawooddoo -nhi
some man
they:may:go
to:him only
wirdinboowoo
he: bites: him!
'Should any man go past (the dog). he'll bite him (for no reason in
particular).' (This describes a vicious dog.)
Winhi 'just, only' often occurs in responses to information questions,
where the effect seems to be to counter presuppositions implicit in the question.
(Cf. similar uses of mangaddi 'not' and marlami 'not' mentioned in sections
6.4.1 and 6.4.2 respectively.)

B: winhi gamba -ga

A: 'What are you lot doing to the children?'
B: 'Nothing much. We're washing them.'
Cf. Goody's (1978) suggestion that pure information questions, which do not at
the same time challenge the addressee, either by the presupposed right of the506TOPICS IN SEMANTICSspeaker to ask the question, or the presuppositions of the question itself, occur
but rarely (and only amongst social'equals'). And indeed, (6-171) could hardly
have been intended as a pure information question. It was part of an elicited
dialogue (in which the speaker took on both sides) that might occur between a
man and a group of women and children who were bathing in the river. Even if
not intended in this way, such a question would most likely be seen as a
challenge to the addressees. The effect of use of winhi 'just, only' here appears to
be to counter an apparent presupposition or expectation that something untoward
was being done to, or happening to the children.
McConvell (1983a) discusses a particle jupu 'only, just' in Gurindji which
has an almost identical range of contextualisations as winhi 'just, only'. The one
sense of the Gurindji jupu 'only, just' that does not appear to occur for the
Gooniyandi winhi 'just, only' is 'for a little while' - this may be because
Gooniyandi has a separate temporal adverbial janggoo which carries this
meaning. Similarly, winhi 'just, only' does not frequently occur in sense (c),
since there is a separate adverbial woongooloo 'for fun, for no particular purpose'
which is normally used to cover this sense. (It would appear that the Gurindji
jupu 'only, just' occurs more regularly in this sense.) The two frequently occur
together, as in
(6-172) winhi woongooloo gardbiyiddorni
only for:fun
we:fight:together
'We're just fighting for fun (with no serious intent).'
This was elicited as an appropriate response to jaji-yoo gardbinggiddarni
(something-OAT you:lot:are:fighting) 'Why are you lot fighting?'.
6.4.8 moorda 'completely'
Due to the paucity of examples, it is impossible to be certain of the exact
significance of this particle. The available examples show three main contextual
senses.
(a) 'Whole, completely'. This sense normally occurs with reference to
swallowing something whole, without chewing:
(6-173) gambayi -ngga
boy
ERGmaa mangaddi binyjangnga moorda
meat nothe:chewed:it wholeniyigbaddi
he: swallowed:it
'The boy didn't chew the meat, he swallowed it whole.'","[487, 488, 489, 490]"
"5.6.2 Expansion
Two primary relationships of expansion are identifiable: (a) CLAUSAL
EXPANSION, in which one clause expands on the meaning of another by
extending, elaborating, or enhancing its meaning; and (b) CONSTITUENT
EXPANSION, in which one clause expands on a constituent of another clause,
again by extending, elaborating, or enhancing its meaning. These possibilities
are not, as I have said, distinguished morphologically, and many sentence formsClAUSE COMPLEXES423are amenable to either interpretation. For example, (5-363) allows at least the
two interpretations shown, respectively clausal and constituent expansion.(5-363) thangarndi garndiwangooddoo gooddoomba -ya
yoodjidi
WCI'd

paper
we we:put:it
thangarndi binaddigmiloona
wool
I:taught:them
'We put lots of words down on paper, and I taught them the
words'; or 'I taught them the words we had put on paper'.
The ambiguity of yoodjidi 'we put it' allows the 'we' to be interpreted as
referring to either the speaker and hearer together, or to the speaker plus one or
more persons other than the hearer (see section 3.6 above). The first of these
possibilities suggests the constituent interpretation, whereby the words in
question are specified; the second suggests the clausal interpretation, the two
situations occurred at the same time.
Although many example sentences allow both interpretations, not all do.
There are numerous examples which allow only the constituent expansion sense;
however, none seem to allow only the clausal expansion interpretation.
Both clausal expansion and constituent expansion are realised by clause
complexes in which the clauses are PARATACTICALLY or HYPOTACTICALLY
related. Embedding of finite clauses does not occur.
In the following two major subsections (5.6.2.1 and 5.6.2.2) I will outline
the range of relations of clausal expansion identifiable on intuitive/logical
grounds (following the lead of Halliday 1985); this will be followed by a similar
treatment of constituent expansion. I will then turn, in section 5.6.2.3, briefly
to the question of the linguistic status of the types.","[406, 407]"
"3.9.3.6 Oblique bound pronominals
The oblique bound pronominals are encliticised forms of the oblique 'case' forms
of the personal pronominals (discussed in section 3.6 above). They refer to
Affected participants in most clause types, and to the Goal in Middle clauses (see
section 5.2.1.3 for details and examples). These pronominals are obligatory in
VPs in all Middle clauses, and in all clauses with Affected participants. They are
given in Table 3-13 (compare Table 3-6).

-nganggi
-nhi - -wanhi-ngiddangi
-yaddangi
-giddangi
-widdangiRemarks on Table 3-13:
(i) As an inspection of this table will reveal, the final syllable of the first person
singular form may (optionally) be elided: both wardbiringaddagi and
wardbiringadda (go-FUT/(2sg)N/I-(lsg)O) 'come to me' occur, apparently in free
variation.(ii) The third person non-singular has the invariant form /widdangi/. Since this
enclitic always follows a vowel, and bears initial stress, it could be written
morphophonemically as either (widdangi} or (biddangi). the latter being the
phonological form of the corresponding free pronominal. I will, however,
represent it here in the least abstract way, as ( widdangi}.
(iii) The third person singular enclitic shows slightly more divergence than do
the other enclitics from its corresponding free form pronominal, nhoowoo. In
addition to the monosyllabic {nhi}, I have postulated a second (and unusual)
allommph, {wanhi). The reason for this is to explain a range of forms involving
the classifiers +I. +DI and +MI in the non-past tenses, where the allomorphsTHE VERB PHRASE225{ad, {dad, and {mad occur. Consider forms such as the following:
/wardbiraanhi/ (go-FUT/(2sg)N/I-(3sg)O) 'go up to him' and /jagjawilimaanhi/
(speak-SUBJ-FUT+(lsg)N+MI-(3sg)O) 'I'll speak to him'. Preceding the other
oblique pronominals, the final vowel of the CC is the expected one, namely /i/
- cf. /wardbiriwiddangi/ (go-FUT/(2sg)N/I-(3pl)O) 'go up to them', and
/jagjawilimiwiddangi/ (speak-SUBJ -FUT+(1 sg)N+Ml-(3pl)O) 'I'll speak to
them'. The easiest way of accounting for these alternations would seem to be to
assume that the third person singular pronominal has the allomorph {wanhi}
when it follows {at}; then the long vowel/aa/ (as in the examples above) would
be derived by VR5.
There is a further, exceptional, pronominal enclitic, -ngangi, not shown in
the table. This pronominal is infrequently used in reference to the speaker-hearer
dyad - i.e. it is a dual inclusive form of the first person -in either an Affected
or Goal function (regardless of clause type). When referring to the Goal in a
transitive clause -ngangi further qualifies the reference of the Accusative
pronominal in the CC (see above 3.9.3.2.2), much in the manner of a number
enclitic. For example, in /milayinangangi/ (see-(IR)N+A-(ldl)O) 'he saw me and
you', the Goal is referred to in the CC by the ACC prefix +jin+ (lR)A, and byngangi in addition. The latter restricts the possible reference of the former to just
the speaker and the hearer. Here, -ngangi is in complementary distribution with
the dual number enclitic, which may refer only to a first person dual exclusive
participant (see next section). Elsewhere -ngangi occurs in place of -ngiddangi.
These two morphemes are not, however, in complementary distribution; they
occur in contrastive variation. Both wardjingangi (go-(3sg)N+I-(ldi)O) 'he came
up to me and you' and wardjingiddangi (go-(3sg)N+I-(1R)O) 'he came up to us
(R)' occur, and the former is more explicit in its reference than the latter.
-Ngangi has not been encountered followed by a number enclitic, nor in
sequence with one of the oblique pronominals, so it is. not perfectly clear to
which order-class it belongs (or whether an additional one should be set up).
3.9.3.7 Number encliticsA single number marking enclitic, specifying either 'dual' (indicating two), or
'paucal' (indicating a few), can optionally occur in final position of any VP in
which at least one bound pronominal (either a prefix to the CC or an oblique
enclitic) is of non-singular number. This pronominal can modify ANY ONE of
the up to three non-singular pronominals that may occur in a finite VP. In case
there is more than one such non-singular category, the question immediately2261HEWORDarises as to which one the number enclitic applies to. I am unable to provide a ·
categorical answer to this question. Moreover, I doubt seriously whether there is
one: it seems likely that an answer will only be possible if discourse factors are
taken into account.
The general statement made in the previous paragraph requires some
qualification. Non-singular categories of the second and third person may be
modified by either the dual or the paucal enclitic. But in the first person nonsingular things are a little more complicated. As might be expected, the dual
will not (normally) apply to the unrestricted category (and there are no such
examples), to which only the paucal can apply. Both the dual and the paucal
may modify the first person restricted category, but the dual is used only in
reference to a pair one of which is the speaker, and the other is a third person
(and never the hearer). If the restricted category refers to the speaker and hearer
pair, it cannot be modified by the dual enclitic. That is, a form such as
milayiddayi (see-(lR)N+A-du) can only mean 'we two (exclusive of the hearer)
saw him'; it cannot mean 'we two (including the hearer) saw him'. (As
mentioned in the previous section, the irregular form -ngangi 'we two inclusive'
could be used in place of -yi, and refer to the speaker and hearer pair; but this
only when they fill the roles of Goal or Affected. -Ngangi may not be used in a
VP with a meaning such as 'we two inclusive saw him'.)
The number enclitics have the following allomorphs:
-yi ~ -yoo
-ddi- -ddoo - -waddi'dual' (du)
'paucal' (pa)The first allomorph in each case seems to be the most frequent variant,
occurring following /i/ or /a/, while the second allomorph usually follows /oo/.
Some examples are: ward-biddi-yi (go-(3pl)N+I-du) 'they went', ward-gooddooyoo (go-PRES+(3pi)N+A-du) 'they (two) go', ngab-jidda-yi (eat-(lR)N+A-du)
'we two (exclusive) ate', mila-winbidda-ddi (see-FUT+(lsg)N+(3pl)A+A-pa)
'they (few) will see me'. miga-limi-widdangi-yi (say-(lsg)N+MI-(3pl)O-du) 'I
told them two', miga-winmi-ngaddagi-yi (say-(3pl)N+MI-(Isg)O-du) 'they two
told me'.
The third allomorph of the paucal number enclitic, -waddi, occurs in
exactly the same circumstances as does the allomorph -wanhi of the third person
singular oblique bound pronominal, namely in the environment of non-past
tense forms of the classifiers +I, +DI and +MI- i.e. following {a 1 ). Examples:

The structure of the VP may be summarised in the following terms. The VP
consists of two obligatory grammatical words, which are mutually bound to, and
modify, one another, and which occur in a fixed order. This order reflects a
progression from specific to general, in terms of the lexical content, and at the
same time, somewhat paradoxically, a progression from the item that is least
specific and individuating in terms of pinning down the process to the referent
world, to the most specific and individuating, the item which refers to the actual
occurrence of the process. The position of enclitics in the VP is now explicable.
Aspect and Mood are ways of viewing the Process or predicate itself, as a whole;
they are not concerned with the actual fact of the occurrence of the Process. For
example, the progressive is concerned with the occurrence of a train of events
leading up to the culmination of the process, rather than to a process emerging
into instantiation; repetition (realised by -nyali REP) refers to repetition of a
Process, with or without the same participants, not to the repetition of an
instantiation of a process. On the other hand, the categories labelled Mode
concern the occurrence and actualisation of a process; it is the enactment of the
process that is seen as desirable, definite, or potential. Enclitics attach to the gwords on which their primary focus falls: the lexical stem in the case of
Aspectual and Mood markers, and the CC in case of Mode, pronominal and
number markers.","[209, 210, 211, 212]"

"It is suggested that the salient syllable marks the FOCUS of the366THE CLAUSEinformation uniL The Focus is the item which the speaker presents as the most
newsworthy, and not recoverable from the preceding discourse; it is always NEW,
in terms of the given/new opposition. In using the term 'new' I do not mean to
suggest that the item must not have been mentioned in the (immediately)
preceding text, or that it may not be present in the extralinguistic situation, as
some writers such as Fronek (1983) have suggested. Rather, as Halliday has
pointed out in many places, new properly applies to items that are evaluated as
not predictable in the circumstances of their occurrence. Thus, for instance, an
entity that the speaker may be sure is identifiable by the hearer, or even present
in his consciousness at the time, may be assigned the value of focal or new, if it
fulfils an unpredictable role in the clause, or if, unpredictably, it plays a role in
the clause at all. This fact has been recognised by Dan~ (1974:111); Chafe, by
contrast, has defined GIVEN as that which is presumed present in the
consciousness of the hearer (1976:30).
In the view proposed here, given and new are LINGUISTIC categories, and
the speaker has available the CHOICE of treating a piece of information as one or
the other. S/he is neither constrained nor forced by extralinguistic factors to
make any particular choice. In other words, the categories given and new are not
pregrammatical or prelinguistic, as has been suggested by writers such as Heath
(1984:606); and furthermore, it is not possible to say on the basis of an
inspection of the linguistic and extralinguistic context that a particular item is
either given or new. There is at best a correlation between the linguistic
categories and the extralinguistic ones, whereby they agree in the majority of
cases. Viewing given and new as pre- or extra-linguistic, linguists have been
forced to conclude that they have no fixed realisation in grammar. By taking the
view advocated in systemic functional grammar, it is clear that there is a direct
relationship between form and meaning - although not between form and
reference. To exemplify this discussion, consider an extract from Text 1 (line
(5)), repeated here as example (5-213).
(5-213) moongaya I milawawinmi

ERG
1n the morning, they two were looking (at the fishing lines).'
Given the textual context of its occurrence, it would be natural for the speaker to
presume that the hearer is able to identify the two individuals referred to by
bidiyooddoongga 'by they two', and even that they were in the forefront of the
hearer's consciousness. But to claim that this phrase is therefore given is to miss
the point; there is no reason for a hearer to suppose that only the two individuals11ffi TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF 11ffi CLAUSE367other than the speaker went to look at the fishing lines in the morning. This is
the reason why the speaker chose to represent bidiyooddoongga 'by they two' as
new and focal information. Thus, only by maintaining the distinction between
linguistic meaning and reference (or core and contextual meaning) can significant
generalisations be made.
The salient syllable most frequently falls on one of the stressed syllables of
the final clausal IC (phrase, adverbial or particle) in the tone unit An exception
to this generalisation concerns the group of clauses which I have referred to as
situations of being (see section 5.2.1.2). These are clauses which have one of
the three stance verbs bagi- 'lie', warang- 'sit' and wara- 'stand', and assert either
the existence of an entity, an attribute of an entity, or a niche the entity
inhabits. In these clauses, the VP always comes finally in the tone unit to
which it belongs, and is never salient. Any stressed syllable within the salient
phrase may have the main stress, although there may be a tendency for the main
stress to fall on the main lexical item in the IC. Salience placement is probably
semantically conditioned: apparently in NPs it identifies phrase level focus, that
is, the item evaluated as the most newsworthy item of the phrase.
It follows from the preceding paragraph that the information Focus usually
falls on the final IC in an information unit This is, however, a tendency, and
not a grammatical rule. Any distributional word in the information unit,
regardless of its position, may be focal. It is hypothesised that the UNMARKED
place for information Focus is on the final IC in the information unit. This
placement is unmarked in respect that the preceding material in the information
unit may be either given or new. An information unit with final Focus may
thus occur in any of the three logically possible circumstances, where the
preceding material is given, new, or some given and some new. The Focus is
MARKED when it occurs on a non-final constituent Here again, the preceding
material may be either given, new, or some given and some new. But the
material following the Focus is positively specified as given or retrievable. That
is, the Focus falls on a non-final constituent only under the condition that the
material following it is given. Conversely, placement of given information
following new information may be presumed to be a marked order.
A number of observations support this claim.
(1) Contrastive focus normally falls on a non-final constituent. For
example,
(5-214) nginyji lililoowa wardbiri I nganyi nginulangaddi

'We split up; I went down, he went up.'
\\eAs is well known (see for example Chafe 1976:33-34}, a contrastive clause
normally involves a presupposition that the situation obtained for someone,
something, or in certain circumstances, or that a certain individual (or time,
place, etc.) was involved in some situation or other. (5-214) is a direct quote and
comes from a text in which a head police tracker is giving instructions to
another tracker. It is reasonable to assume that there is a presupposition that
each would go in some direction.
(5-214) and (5-215) show that the presupposed material (or a linguistic
expression representing it in whole or part) follows the Focus. What is
presupposed is of course given, and is explicitly marked as such by its
placement after the Focus. On the other hand, being given, presupposed material
is likely to be ellipsed, resulting in a construction with unmarked Focus- see
line (41) of Text 1.
(2) The placement of the propositional modifiers mangaddi 'no, not',
yiganyi 'uncertain', thaddi 'mistakenly believed', etc., conftrm the above pattern.
Immediately following non-final foci are contrastive. Consider example (5-216},
which comes from a text concerning a man who got lost in the desert. The
immediately preceding text had described him starting on his way back home.
Thus it is presupposed that he was returning home, and the material following
the Focus, wardji riwiyidda 'he went to his camp', constitutes given information.
The adverbial thiddgirli 'straight' is thus a point of contrastive focus, contrasting
with the Focus of the following information unit, ngilayani ngiwayinyali 'east
and south again'.riwiyidda I ngiwayi wardji

either formally by morphology or syntax, or, as far as I can tell, prosodically.
Information requests are made indirectly by statements offering some
information, but leaving something indefinite (cf. Eades 1982). In this way, the
speaker may hope to elicit a response filling in the indefmite blank. Information
requests use the indefinite determinersjaji 'something', ngoorndoo 'someone' and
ngoonyoo 'something', as well as the adverbials yiniga 'somehow' and
yaningimi (morphologically 'now-indefinite') 'sometime'. These indefinite words
are always the information Focus in information requests - but not all
utterances in which they are focal are questions, or construed as questions. The
reason for this is obvious: the speaker would quite naturally single out and draw
attention to the indefinite or unknown part of his utterance, the part s/he seeks
elaboration of or comment on, as the most newsworthy. In addition, the
indefinite word is typically non-final (unless it is the only element in the unit),
and a marked information Focus. (5-217) is an example:
(5-217) ngoorndoo -ngga ngaaddi widdbginyja I
someone
ERG stone
you:throw:it
'Who are you throwing stones.'
The explanation for the fact that the indefinite word is a marked Focus is
that questions are pragmatically marked (see Goody 1978), and typically involve
a presupposition that the predication holds true for at least one entity, place,
time, etc .. And this presupposition may be treated as given information. For
(5-217), the action was of course situationally obvious.
I remark that in ''rhetorical questions'"" - that is, utterances which look like
questions but which are not used to elicit infonnation, and for which straight
linguistic responses would be judged inadequate - the indefinite word is not
nonnally focal. The Focus is unmarked, and falls on the VP in (5-218), which is a
quoted utterance of a white head stockman to his Aboriginal workers questioning
their action of cutting a bullock skin which he had explicitly instructed them not
to do. Presumably he was not merely seeking infonnation.
-yoo gajgilanggidda I
(5-218) jaji
something DAT you:plural:have:cut:it
'Why have you cut it?'
In a similar way, when the indefmite word is followed by either -widdi UNKN or
-ngaddaya TOO, there is not usually any presupposition involved. And the
indefinite word, or the distributional word it forms a part of, does not nonnally
constitute a marked Focus. These observations are exemplified in (5-219), which
shows that the resulting utterance closely approximates clauses with indefinites in
English:370THE ClAUSE

"1HEWORD168If the additional feature [+singular] is invoked, it is possible to distinguish
and characterise all of the pronominal categories, as shown in Table 3-4, which
cites the nominative forms.

++The bracketed symbols of the bottom line indicate that number specification is
redundant for the non-third person categories. However, that number is relevant
to, or inherent in, these categories is evident from the fact that when the nonsingulars occur in the Entity role in NPs, it can be, but need not necessarily be
marked more precisely by number words, or by the postpositions -yooddoo DU
and -yarndi PL.
The feature analysis of Table 3-4 specifies each pronoun in such a way as
to distinguish it from every other pronoun, and associates with each an
underlying meaning specified in terms of features. This neatly encapsulates the
referential meaning of the two non-singular first person pronouns ngidi and
yaadi, providing a formal statement of the verbal description given earlier.
However, it should be noted that this does no more than provide a formal
summary of the earlier verbal statement. We must raise the question as to
whether the proposed analysis has any independent linguistic validity, and/or
whether any linguistic evidence might be invoked in support of it. The answer
to this would seem to be almost certainly NO: it is difficult to see how any
linguistic evidence might be relevant to the analysis. A more important problem
with the analysis, however, relates to the fact that the proposed features are
purely referential, and so cannot account for the avoidance usage of yaadi, in
place of ngidi, in reference to the speaker-hearer dyad, and of bidi 'they' in place
of niyi 'he, she, it', in reference to a single individual (see section 1.5 above).
As an alternative means of description, we might attempt to arrange the
Gooniyandi pronouns in a two dimensional paradigmatic set of the usual sort.
Something of this sort has already been implied by my reference to yaadi and
ngidi as first person categories in opposition to one another, the former beingPRONOMINALS169labeled unrestricted, and the latter, restricted. This implies an arrangement of the
pronominals as follows:
1sg
nganyi2
3nginyji
niyinon-sg
R ngidi
u yaadi
gidi
bidiAn alternative analysis might not take the + values for S in Table 3-4 as
defining the category of first person, but instead distinguish yaadi from all other
pronominals by virtue of the fact that it alone has a+ value for each of S, H and
0. The pronominals could then be arranged as follows:
12
3
1/2/3sg
nganyi
nginyji
niyinon-sg
ngidi
gidi
bidi
yaadiThe advantage of the paradigmatic approach is that it does not use strictly
referential features, and so does not suffer from the problems in avoidance usage,
inherent in the earlier analysis. However, there seem to be no strong arguments
for one paradigmatic arrangement over the other (see also McGregor forthcoming-c), and I have arbitrarily chosen to view yaadi as a first person form.
It will be clear that at least three individuals must be included in the
referent set of yaadi 'we unrestricted'. I have heard only the plural marker -yarndi
in construction with yaadi 'we unrestricted' in natural and elicited Gooniyandi
speech. However, when I constructed the d-word yaadi-yooddoo (first person
unrestricted-DU), it was not rejected outright, but speakers suggested that it
might refer to just three of us, the speaker, the hearer, and one other person.
(Alan Rumsey elicited a similar response to the corresponding constructed form
in Bunuba (pers.comm.).) This might be taken to suggest that -yooddoo marks
'plus one' or unit augmented (McKay 1978) rather than 'dual', were it not for the
fact that speakers themselves frequently use yaadi-yarndi (first person
unrestricted-PL) in reference to this particular group of three.
I have already mentioned (section 1.5 and immediately above) shifts in the
pronominal categories in avoidance contexts, whereby non-singular forms are
used in reference to and in addressing a single avoidance kinsman. Reference to
the speaker and a single hearer (where the two are in an avoidance relation to oneTHE WORD170another) is by means of the unrestricted yaadi, instead of the usual and predicted
restricted ngidi. One might predict that in such circumstances the dual
postposition could be used to mark the number: i.e. yaadi-yooddoo (we
unrestricted-DU) in reference to an S and a H in an avoidance relation. There are,
however, no supporting examples for this possibility.
Corresponding to each person-number combination distinguished in the
language, there are three distinct free-standing pronouns, which I will regard as
alternate forms of a single lexeme. I will refer to the forms as nominative,
oblique and emphatic; they are tabulated in Table 3-5.

the forms shown in the table above.
The emphatic forms are obviously based on the corresponding oblique
forms: a segment -jinga is added to a truncated version of the oblique
pronominal. For the non-singulars, the final vowel is deleted; for the singulars,
the final vowel and preceding consonant are deleted; and for the third person
singular, the velar nasal is inserted preceding -jinga.
Secondly, the non-singulars show d in the second syllable of the

determiner niyi 'that' (see 3.3.1.1), that they are indeed two distinct words is
evident from the fact that the latter does not have a distinct oblique form
nhoowoo, as does the pronominal; nor does it contrast with the non-singular
pronominal bidi 'they'.","[152, 153, 154, 155]"
"Gooniyandi direct quotation thus corresponds to both direct and indirect quotation
in English. Each of the examples (5-336) to (5-342) above has an alternative
translation as indirect speech in English. For example, (5-346) could be rendered
into English as 'that man demanded that I give him money'.
Speech may also be reported INDIRECfLY, although this is far less frequent
than direct report, at least where the projecting clause is one of speech. The
second clause of (5-347) and the frrst clause of (5-348), for example, representindirectly- the content of the communicative event. This is so whether or notCLAUSE COMPLEXES417the two clauses together constitute a single clause complex (or sentence).Sngoonyi -yidda wardgiri

Clauses of indirect speech represent the sense of the utterance from the
perspective of the present speech situation. That is, the ongoing speech
situation, and not the one referred to, is the reference point for the deictic
categories of person, tense, and spatial deixis. And it is from this viewpoint that
the 'validity' of the utterance is measured. The distinction between direct and
indirect speech in Gooniyandi, then, does not coincide with the direct/indirect
speech opposition in English. In English the two types contrast in that direct
speech represents the wording of the utterance, and indirect speech represents the
sense (Halliday 1985:230). In Gooniyandi, on the other hand, direct speech
represents the sense of the utterance from the viewpoint of the speech act referred
to, and, as mentioned above, makes no claims about its wording. Gooniyandi
indirect speech represents the sense of the utterance from the viewpoint of the
present speech situation.
Projected indirect quote clauses as a rule follow the projecting clause. There
are only a couple of instances of the reverse order, and in these cases the
projecting clause seems to be added as a type of afterthought. For example, the
final clause inwanyanbiddini I migami -ngiddangi I
(5-349) ngirndaji -ya
he:told to:us
this
LOC they:left:him
'They left him here, he told us.'
was added after a pause, and on a different intonation contour, apparently as a
qualification of the status of the first clause as based on report rather than on
direct observation. (Note in addition that the reference point for spatial deixis has
been shifted in the first clause of (5-349) to the speech situation referred to. It is
8 In this connection it may be relevant to enquire whether (felicitous) responses
to utterances such as (5-347) and (5-348) respond to the clause of communication
or to the clause representing the utterance communicated, or to either. If the first
(only), this would suggest that the clauses do in fact form a complex together.
Unfortunately, I have no data bearing on this question.","[400, 401]"
"THE ClAUSE362Not every pause signifies the end of a tone unit, however. There may be pauses
in which the speaker is collecting his/her thoughts, which are followed by
material identified as being from the same tone unit, on the grounds that pitch is
relatively constant before and after the pause. Occasionally, too, two tone units
will occur in succession, with no intervening pause. For examples of tone units
see the texts in Appendix 1.
The tone units into which a text is divided typically do not correspond to
grammatical divisions into clauses or sentences. Quite often a single NP is
uttered in isolation, in a tone unit of its own, separate from the other
constituents of the clause to which it belongs. And the remaining constituents,
which need not correspond to any grammatical division of the clause, may fall
into a single tone unit. However, tone units are not distributed randomly across
the clauses of a text. As a rule, a clause consists of an integral number usually between one and five - of tone units, each of which contains an
integral number of clausal ICs. Tone units do not normally consist of parts of
two clauses, or parts of two phrases (unless they are discontinuous). Most
frequently, a clause will fall into either one or two tone units as illustrated in
example (5-206). Although maximal division as in (5-207) is possible, it israre.

'We two men followed the footprints.'
Rarely, a single tone unit consists of two full clauses.
This raises the question: If tone units don't correspond to grammatical
units, what do they represent? The answer proposed here is that tone units
represent the INFORMATION UNITS into which the speaker opts to divide his or
her utterance. Precisely this suggestion has been made by Halliday (1970) for
English, and subsequently by Kilham (1977) and Heath (1984) for the (unrelated)
Australian languages Wile Munkan and Nunggubuyu respectively. (See also
Grimes 1975.}
I am suggesting that tone units delimit information units into which the
speaker packages his message, each tone unit corresponding to a unit ofTHE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE363information, the amount of information s/he thinks the hearer can take in at one
time. Thus, Gooniyandi texts consist of sequences of units each of which carries
one ""piece"" or quantum of information. This raises the important but often
ignored question: What is information? Halliday (1985) has suggested that
""information ... is a process of interaction between what is already known or
predictable and what is new or unpredictable"". There are two problems with this
formulation. The first is that information units sometimes relate things which
are both new; the second is that it is not explained what types of things may be
associated together in this way.
A rather different view of the nature of information is held by writers such
as Fronek (1983), who claim that information can be presented only through
propositional structures, which means that information is a nexus between a
predicate and its arguments. Both Halliday and Fronek agree on one thing: that
information involves some son of nexus. It appears that this nexus may be of
one of the following three types:
(a) A propositional nexus, that is, the connection between a full predicate
and its arguments, expressed in a clause.
(b) An association between two entities, or an entity and an attribute.
(5-208) illustrates this:
(5-208) gamba joomoo laandi
up
water soakbagiri I ngaddanggaminhingi
it:liesfrom:dreamtimegamba/
water
'There's a soak up there, one with dreamtime associations.'
In the second information unit of this example, only a part of the nexus finds
linguistic expression; the other part occurs in the preceding unit. This
information COULD have been expressed clausally in a single tone unit - but
there is no reason to believe that the second information unit of this example is
an (elliptical) clause.
(c) An association between a linguistic constituent or its referent, and a
clausal or phrasal role. For instance, in (5-206), the first information unit
associated the person Ned Collins with the role of Agent, the rider of the horse.
Alternatively, and/or concurrently, the associated role may be the textual one of
theme.
The rate of injection of information in a text depends mainly on the
speaker's evaluation of how quickly the hearer can take it in - which is
presumably based on considerations of presumed familiarity with the subject364THE CLAUSEmatter, degree of interest in the subject matter, intelligence, etc. - and is
controlled by its division into information units (see Grimes 1975:297). It is
inversely proportional to the number of information units into which the text is
divided. (5-207) shows a very slow rate of information injection; it is much
quicker in (5-209), where the speaker is presenting an affectively loaded part of
the discourse, the point at which he finds a lost man.(5-209) nganyi joodoo -nyali wardngi niyi gilbali I
I
straight REP I:went him I:found:him
'I went straight up and found him.'
The rate of information delivery can be slowed right down by dividing a
particular message into two clauses and two information units. The first unit
will state the matter in its starkest terms, and this will be elaborated on in the
following unit. In this way, not only is the rate of information flow controlled,
but each aspect can be made prominent in a 'natural' way - that is, may be
made the unmarked Focus of information (see below) - without overloading
any message unit.(5-210) niyaji ralwiddayi I
boonbooloo ralwiddayi I
this they:two:plucked:it feather
they:two:plucked:it
They plucked it; they plucked its feathers.'
When a given clause consists of two or more tone/information units, it is
typically the case that one of the units can be identified as more central or
PRIMARY than the other unit(s), which will be referred to as SECONDARY
unit(s). The primary unit has a more prominent salient syllable, and an
intonation contour characterised by greater pitch movement. On the other hand, a
secondary unit normally has a slight rise in pitch on its final syllable when it
precedes the primary unit, but a low falling pitch contour (i.e. with a low initial
pitch) when it follows the primary. No matter what its position, the primary
unit does not have the slight rise of the type associated with an initial secondary.

to the contrary, that at least one item, whose identity is unknowq, is involved in
the situation. The clause contradicts a expectation that the situation did not, or
will not, occur. The type of indefiniteness involved in this use of -ngaddaya
TOO must be distinguished from at least three other types of indefiniteness: theENCUTICS479'identity unknown' sense of the indefinite determiners ngoonyoo 'which', yaabja
'some', ngoorndoo 'who', etc.; the 'something/ someone, I don't know and it
doesn't matter which' sense of the enclitic -widdi UNKN; and the 'possibly, but
not certainly' sense of the enclitic -mi - -ma IND. None of these latter invoke
any expectation that the situation did not occur. The indefinite plus -ngaddaya
TOO is used to assert, against an implicit expectation to the contrary, that at
least one entity of the indefinite set (referred to by the lexeme) is involved in the
situation. Thus (6-81) occurred in a text concerning the desire of the Bayulu
people to gain title to a small tract of land forming a tiny comer of an enormous
cattle station. The speaker is imagining. contrary to his belief or expectation to
the contrary, that someone would say to them that they could take the land.
Similarly, (6-82), which comes from the same text, contradicts an implicit
presumption that the speaker attributes to the authorities, that the Bayulu people
do not really want any land of their own.
On the other hand, the unmarked indefinite phrases (such as ngoorndoo
'someone', yaabja 'some', etc.) and those followed by the enclitic -widdi UNKN
are not found where there is a presumption that the situation does not obtain.
Rather, if ~ere is any presumption involved, it is that the situation does obtain:
the indefinite indicates that it is the identity of the relevant entity (or whatever)
in the situation that is not known to the speaker (cf. the discussion of questions
in section 5.4.1).
This clarifies the nature of the difference between the opposition some vs. any in
English and -widdi UNKN vs. -ngaddaya TOO in Gooniyandi (which on first glance
appear parallel). Roughly, English favours 'some x' where a unique referent is
expected; and 'any x' when there is doubt as to whether an x was in fact involved,
or if the situation holds for every member of the given set. Neither of the English
terms counters an expectation or presumption contrary to the statement of the
clause itself, which is the only circumstance in which -ngaddaya TOO occurs.
Otherwise, an indefinite determiner (or NP) will cover the meaning of 'some' and
'any'.","[462, 463]"
"5.6.1.1 Projection of speech
Speech is normally reported in the form of a 'direct quote', which provides a
possible wording for the spoken utterance. That is, it represents an utterance
concerning the world as it might have been, or might be spoken; it does not
directly refer to a situation or relation of the world. The deictic categories of
tense, person, spatial deixis, etc. are all shifted to the reference point of the
speech situation referred to. Quoted speech clauses are usually projected by
clauses referring to the situation in which the speech was uttered. They may,
however, occur independently. A text count showed that about a third of quoted
speech clauses occur in isolation, the remaining two-thirds being projected. (See
the texts of Appendix 1; examples of independent quotations occur in lines (33)
and (52) of Text 1, line (12) of Text 2, and lines (8) and (12) of Text 3.) When
a clause is not projected by a clause of speech, the fact that it is a representation
of what was said (rather than of what happened, or will happen) may be signalled
by a change in voice quality.
Both orders, projecting preceding projected, and projected preceding
projecting, occur. The former predominates in elicited responses to prompts of
the type ""x told y to' ...""'; however, a textual count showed approximately the
same frequency of each order. Examples are, respectively, (5-337), and line (38)
of Text 1.
(5-337) migami -ngadda
she:told to:mengaraggi/a dillybag gardiya
I:make:itwhite:peoplengangjawili
I:will:give:him
'She told me ""I make dillybags to sell to white people"".'
Sometimes the quoted clause is discontinuous, flanking the projecting clause on
both sides- see for example line (51) of Text 1, and (5-342) below.
The relationship between the projected and the projecting clause appears to
be paratactic: there is no convincing evidence that the projected quotation is
subordinate to the clause of communication. (There is certainly no evidence thatTHE CLAUSE414the directly quoted clause is embedded: in particular, the quotation clearly does
not fulfil a similar role to thangarndi 'word' in thangarndi jijagji (word he:said)
'he spoke words'.)
There are two main types of clause that project direct quotations.
(a) Projecting clauses are predominantly clauses of speech or verbal
communication. The main lexical verbs referring to such processes are:migajagjijagyan.gingoowajbaajangirooddijgamalg-'say, tell, do'
'say, tell'
'say, speak'
'request, ask'
'call by name, tell'
'shout out'
'answer, reply'
'argue, swear'
'speak, say, tell' (avoidance style lexeme)This classification of speech act types is quite different from the classification I
have proposed in section 5.4.1. It does not distinguish assertions from
proposals, both of which (in all their subtypes) occur in quotes with each of the
verbs listed, except perhaps for rooddij- 'argue, swear', which normally occurs
only in reference to exclamations and proposals. Yan.gin- 'ask, request', for
example, indicates either a request for information (a question), as in (5-338), or
a request for action, as in (5-339):yan.ginli

meat maybe you:will:give:me
'He requested of me ""Will you give me some meat?"".'
It might be expected that clauses referring to bodily processes such as nyimij'wink', nyamnyam- 'whisper', could project direct quotes. However, the only
potential example available is
(5-340) midda -ngga nginnginmi marlami

'He cooked the two men in coals.'
There is a contrast between the roles of Means and Instrument on one hand,
and Accompaniment on the other. Minimal pairs exist such as (5-120) and
(5-137) in which the spear may be treated as either an Instrument (and realised by
an -ngga ERG PP), or by a Means (realised by a -ngaddingga PP).
(5-137) jinali -ngaddi -ngga nyagbini
spear COMIT ERG he:speared:it
'He speared it with a spear.'
However, I would claim that the two expressions are not in free variation. The
Instrument is generally an extension of the Agent (or Actor), which is either a
body-part or used as a tool. Means are not so much extensions of an Agent (or
Actor) as intermediaries through which the action comes about. A Means need
not be actively used as a tool, and is rarely a body-part. In clauses of undirected
action, Means are not used agentively; little effort is as a rule required on the
part of the actor to use them. In using rope for climbing (example (5-135)),
horses for riding, legs for standing, etc., the Actor does not direct his/her efforts
through these Means, which do no more than assist him/her in the process. Use
of the Instrument, as mentioned above (page 337), typically requires effort, and
does not assist in the accomplishment of the action. In clauses of directed action,
body-parts are typically Instruments: consistent with my claim that action is
directed through an Instrument. (Note that this does not mean that it is
intentionally directed. More accurately, the direction of the action is extended'i'II'I''i ' .•''il''i ,,11I1I'.;:344THE CLAUSE::i:Ithrough the part.) Non-body-parts are typically Means.
It is only in a few situation types that there is a choice between treating
something as a Means vs. treating it as an Instrument. It follows from my
earlier remarks (see page 329) that in clauses of directed action the choice is only
available when that thing could be Agent in a situation of the same type. This
holds for processes of impact and violence, gard- 'hit', nyag- 'spear, pierce'
(example (5-120) above), bilgoodd- 'crack on the skull', etc .. For other directed
action types, including for instance all types of throwing, cooking carrying,
tying, etc., which do not involve impact, a non-body-part cannot be referred to
by an -ngga PP - either as an Instrument or as an Agent. The significance of
the choice between Means and Instrument, in those cases where it is available, is
not yet clear. Mel uk (pers.comm.) has suggested that the difference may be
between whether the thing is hand-held or not, and this is consistent with my
remarks above that the Instrument is an extension of the Agent.
Accompaniment is also expressed by -ngaddi (CO MIT) and -ngaddingga
(CO MIT -ERG) PPs (see section 5.2.3.5 below). That there is a distinction
between Means and Accompaniment is shown by two main facts. Firstly,
Means may be questioned by either yinigangaddi (somehow-COMIT) 'how, by
what/some means' or jajingaddi(ngga) (something-COMIT-(ERG)) 'with
what/something.'
(5-138) A: yiniga -ngaddi nyagboowoo
how COMIT you:will:spear:it
B: jinali -ngaddi-ngga nyagboowoospear COMIT ERG you:will:spear:itA: 'How do you spear it?'
B: 'You spear it with a spear.'
Accompaniment may be questioned by jajingaddi(ngga) 'with what/something',
but not by yinigangaddi 'how'. Secondly, Accompaniment in clauses of directed
action need not be something in the company of the Actor (see below section
5.2.3.5). Means must be used by the Actor (not by the patient or undergoer).
For Accompaniment PPs, but not for Means, there are agnate clauses in which
the PP realises a phrasal role, usually Qualifier (cf. Rumsey 1980:670).
5.2.3.4 MannerCircumstances of Manner either: (a) indicate a quality of the situation,
characterising the way it was done, or (b) make a comparison with the quality of
action by another individual. The adverbial miga 'in that manner' is substitutableTHE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION345for Manner circumstantials:~I(5-139) miga

'(The diver bird) sits with his wings extended.'
(a) Quality is expressed either by an adverb (see sections 3.4.1 and 3.12.3.1
above), or by a nominal phrase, either an NP or an ERG PP. An example of the
former is:
(5-141) ngaaddi wajladdi thiddgirli wajgiladdirni
stone I:threw:it straight I:might:have:thrown:it
'I threw the stone; I tried to throw it straight'
(See also examples in section 3.4.1 above.)
The choice between an NP or an ERG PP depends on the transitivity of the
clause: the former occurs in intransitive clauses, the latter, elsewhere. (Unlike
the participant role of Agent, but like the non-participant roles of Means and
Instrument, Quality in a clause of directed action is never realised by an NP i.e. the ERG postposition may not be omitted.) Some examples are:
(5-142) jimandi -nyali barwindi mangaddi dagooddawani
good
REP he:climbed not
he:was:falling
'He climbed up well all the way; he didn't fall.'

trud
he:went
'He walked madly.'
(5-144) gardlooni wangmadda -ngga
I:hit:him rrurl
ERG
'I hit him crazily.'
As can be seen from the last two examples above, the nominal phrase
potentially refers to a concomitant quality of the Actor, and the phrases have
other interpretations as Attributes (on which see section 5.2.4).
We might recognise, in the following example, another type of Quality,II

"Partial reduplication involves repetition of two syllables only of the
reduplicated root, and so is distinguishable from total reduplication only when
the root has three or more syllables. (However, neither type of reduplication is
attested for roots of more than four syllables - which are in any event quite
rare.)In partial reduplication it is normally the first two syllables that are
repeated; they are prefixed to the full form of the root. For example,
gambagambayi 'young boys' from gambayi 'young boy'; garigaringi 'wives'
from garingi 'wife'; nyamanyamani 'many big ones' from nyamani 'big'. In one
instance a partial reduplication included a part of the third (phonological)
syllable, a nasal homorganic with the following stop, as a syllable closing nasal
in the prefix: jaddanjaddandi 'twigs' from jaddandi 'twig'. This harks back to the
question of the status of final ndi sequences (see above pages 72-73), perhaps
suggesting that (at least here) the final di is epenthetic.
Occasionally it is the final two syllables that are reduplicated, as in
jiginyaginya 'very little' from jiginya 'little'.
Some roots occur in both partial and total reduplication, with unclear
semantic difference: barndanyi 'old woman' reduplicates to barndawarndanyi and
barndanyibarndanyi, both of which translate into English as 'old women'.
Reduplication normally indicates plurality. Nominals in Gooniyandi are
not marked for number, and an unreduplicated root may refer to any number of
entities. When so desired, plurality may be indicated (optionally) by a number
word (see section 3.3.4), number postposition (section 3.7), or, in the case of
human and higher animate 'participants' (see page 293 below), by non-singular
pronominals and number enclitics in the VP (section 3.9.3). It is not certain238'IHEWORDprecisely how reduplication differs from these less marked means of indicating
plurality. What can be said, however, is that reduplications normally seem to
suggest vagueness, generality or distributiveness of reference, that the
reduplicated stem refers to the whole as a single entity, ignoring the
individuality of the entities making it up. For example, reduplications of 'human
reference' terms as in boolgawoolga 'old men' from boolga 'old man', and
barndanyibarndanyi 'old women', are normally used generically- see for
instance lines (I) and (8) of Text 2. And the term gambagambayi 'young boys'
(cited above) occurred in a text describing initiation, and might be glossed 'all
the young boys' in this context. Reduplications of other nominals show a
similar pattern. For example: dagoorla 'depression, hole' reduplicates to
dagoorladagoorla 'covered in depressions', which was used to describe a rough dirt
road; similarly jaddinggi 'sharp, a point' reduplicates to jaddinggijaddinggi
'covered with sharp points, spiky', which was used to describe a limestone range.
In keeping with these remarks, number words do not normally modify
reduplicated nominals.
In some cases reduplication seems to have an effect of intensification,
especially where the nominal is used as a modifier (cf. below 3.12.3.2 for
adverbials). For example, jiginyaginya 'very little' (cited above), and
widdgawiddgarli 'blue (of the sky)', from widdgarli, a colour term covering the
range from green to blue.
There are a fair number of independent nominal roots which are analysable
as reduplications of meaningless formatives. In fact, a large proportion of roots
of more than four syllables are of this type. Except when the formative is
monosyllabic, the reduplication always involves two syllables of the formative,
usually the first two, which are then prefixed to the formative. For example,
gooroogooroo 'black', binyjawinyja 'shell pendant', garndagarndadi 'oesophagus'.
(Contrast Walmajarri karntarrkarntarr 'interior of throat'- Hudson 1978:97.) If
the formative is monosyllabic, of course, that single syllable is reduplicated, as
in binybiny 'crimson chat'. As has already been mentioned, formatives are
phonotactically regular - for example they are always at least two morae in
length, and are treated, for the purposes of stress, as independent words, each
having an initial stressed syllable. They also show /b - w/ lenition (third
example above). which occurs in stem-forming reduplication. and the consonant
clusters which may occur at formative boundaries appear to be as for stem
forming reduplication (cf. page 81).
There is at least one example in which the fmal two syllables are repeated
and suffixed:jangalangala 'red ant'. As mentioned earlier, such words show stress~-·
1,,WORD FORMATION239pattems of simple roots- or equally of complex words involving bisyllabic
suffixes.
Bird names, and to a lesser extent animal and plant names, account for
most examples of formative reduplication. The process is iconic to the extent
that the formatives involved frequently form a part of the accepted renderings of
the calls of the birds. For example, diyadiya 'peewee', one of whose calls is
CdiA'diA?'diA'diA] (uttered in a high voice register- page 228 above).
Morphologically unanalysable roots may be -or may involve- obvious
reduplications of independent verbal roots, which signify a characteristic activity
(rather than a call) of the species. An example of this is yaboonabarbar, the
name of a species of snake that habitually climbs (bar- means 'climb') in the
yaboona tree. Another example is perhaps giddagiddayi, in which the root gidda'run' is reduplicated (the final syllable, -yi, looks suspiciously like the third
person singular past tense form of the classifier +1), which refers to a water bird
belonging to the plover family which habitually runs along the edge of the
water.
3.12.2 Verbal word formation
3.12.2.1 Verbal stem forming suffixesThere are just a few suffixes6 which form verbal stems from verbal roots; the
resulting stems invariably differ in meaning from the roots from which they are
constructed in terms of their 'aspectual character' or inherent aspectual type
(Lyons 1977:706). There are two main reasons why these suffixes are identified
as stem forming: the root plus suffix behaves as a unit in the choice of
classifier, which means that a root and a derived stem normally collocate with
different classifiers; and secondly, this unit may realise the lexical head of a nonfinite VP, as in N[vp[v[wird-bili]v]yp-milllN (bite-IT-CHAR) 'a real biter (e.g. a
mosquito)'.
[1] -bi- - -bili- ... -ji- .... -mi-. These four forms appear to be allomorphs of
a single morpheme. This morpheme indicates that the referent situation involves
a number of repetitions of an individual sub-process; it will be glossed iterative
(IT). Translation into English often involves the use of a different lexeme, one
6 The fact that the morphemes in question never occur finally in d-words shown below by hyphens on their right hand side - might seem to suggest that
they are infixes rather than suffixes. However, they are regarded as suffixes since
they are clearly suffixed to the initial g-word of the VP, which they modify, and
which they may terminate; they do not occur within a single grammatical word.","[222, 223, 224]"
"18INTRODUCI10NUnlike its counterpart in Dyirbal, Dyalnguy (Dixon 1972:32), the
Gooniyandi avoidance style is not a fully distinct and separate language, with its
own vocabulary. Nor is it obligatorily and mechanically chosen in response to a
fully predetermined interaction type. As Rumsey (1982a:160) has poin:ed o~t,
the use of the style is ""a part of the means for CONSTITUTING the relationship
between the interactants as one of 'avoidance' or potential affinehood"" (his
emphasis). The avoidance style is characterised by a cluster of formal features
and strategies of language use which distinguish it from other Gooniyandi styles
of speech, and which may be found to varying degrees in actual utterances.
Different degrees of avoidance can thus be 'marked' or 'indicated' by varying
usage of avoidance features (see below).
In formal terms, the avoidance style differs somewhat in lexicon, but has
the same bound morphemes as ordinary Gooniyandi. There are over one hundred
distinct avoidance Iexemes; these tend to be longer than ordinary words, and to
exhibit a higher frequency of heterogeneous consonant clusters than is found in
ordinary words. Not every ordinary word has a distinct avoidance counterpart,
however. Some gaps, such as the absence of terms for sexual organs and acts are
expected; others are not- for example, despite intensive questioning, I was able
to find a distinct term for only one animal, the dog. (I have been unable to
discern general principles characterising the lexical range of the avoidance
vocabulary.)
Avoidance words in Australian languages tend to be more general than their
everyday counterparts (Dixon 1972, Haviland 1978, Rumsey 1982a). In
Gooniyandi it is primarily the verbal roots of the avoidance style that are more
general than their ordinary counterparts. For instance, gamalg- 'say, tell, speak,
etc.' has a range of meanings that is covered by a number of more specific
everyday terms, including jag- 'say', jijag- 'speak', miga- 'tell', etc. Avoidance
verb roots typically occur with a larger range of classifiers (see section 3.9.3.2)
than do ordinary verbs, and in this way some, though certainly not all, of the
lexical ambiguity may be resolved. The avoidance verb root gamalg-, for
example, occurs with the classifier +MI 'effect' to convey the sense 'tell, say';
with +DI 'catch' to convey the sense 'put a question'; and with +I 'be, go' to
convey the sense 'speak, talk'. On the other hand, jag- occurs with only the
classifier +MI, jijag- with only +I, and mig a- with only +MI and +I. In this
respect the Gooniyandi avoidance style contrasts sharply with the Bunuba one
whic.h.has a particular auxiliary verb (see page 6 above, and Rumsey I982a: 167)
spe~tftc to th~ ~tyle .. In the Bunuba system, the choice of auxiliary verb is not
available to dtstmgmsh among the senses of a lexical verb root.","[30, 31]"
"SPEECH STYLES19Nominal roots generally have the same meaning as their everyday
counterparts. For example, the avoidance nominal ngarloomaii 'spear'
corresponds to the ordinary generic term for spear,jinali, including in its range
precisely the same subtypes. On those occasions when I requested an avoidance
equivalent for a more specific type of spear, I was invariably given the ordinary
term. The response was invariably the same when I requested other specific
terms, and I could detect no tendency to extend the range of an avoidance
nominal beyond the range of its corresponding ordinary term. It thus appears that
avoidance nominals have exact, or nearly exact, ordinary equivalents, and can not
be used to effect higher order taxonomic groupings than those which are a1rcady
made in the ordinary language (cf. Dixon 1972:292ff).
A few closed class grammatical items also have distinct avoidance terms.
For example, there is a particle woomoorla 'no, not, nothing, without', which
corresponds to the particle mar/ami 'not, nothing, without' of the everyday style,
and perhaps also to mangaddi 'no, not' (sec page 496 below); there is also a
nominal yawinhingi 'some, other' corresponding to the everyday terms yaanya
'other' and yaabja 'some'. At least in the latter instance, a distinction made in the
everyday vocabulary is neutralised in the avoidance vocabulary.
It will come a<> no surprise that in Gooniyandi avoidance speech, as in the
Bunuba variety (Rumsey 1982a), not every word in an utterance need be- or
even could be - an avoidance word. Often only a single word in an utterance
marks it as avoidance speech, whether or not other ordinary words COULD BE
replaced by avoidance terms. Indeed, a single feature, such as use of a non·
singular free pronoun, pronominal enclitic or prefix wit11 singular reference, may
even suffice.
Strategies of language use differ between avoidance spct>.Ch and everyday
speech. There are differences in: (I) modes of address and reference; (2) frequency
of propositional modification; and (3) degree of precision of expression.
(1) A man was of course not supposed to address his actual WM; nor could
he utter her name, or a close homonym. Reference to her could be oblique (e.g.
by using the term moonga 'dark'}, by use of a marked or triangular kin-tenn (e.g.
manaroo '(your) mother', speaking toW or WB), or by use of the third person
non-singular pronominal bidi 'they'. Other maddiyali, with whom speech was
permitted, were addressed with the second person non-singular pronominal gidi,
instead of the singular form nginyji. S/he would be referred to by means of the
third person plural bidi if the relationship was a close one, but otherwise more
frequently by the singular niyi; and the first person unrestricted yaadi 'we three or
more inclusive' would be used instead of ngidi 'we two, we exclusive' (seeINTRODUCTION20· 3 .6) m

speech, presumably with the intended effect of softening the force of the
utterance (cf. Stubbs 1983:113).
(3) Avoidance speech is characteristically vaguer in expression than is
ordinary speech (Rumsey 1982a:l73, McConvell 1982:97), and this vagueness
is iconic of the relation of avoidance or lack of intimacy which it t~nccxles.
Although an avoidance verb is typically vaguer than an ordinary one, much of
the potential ambiguity is resolved once the context is ta.ken into account. For
example, in
(1-1) malab -migooddgoo
make he:effected:it hole
'He dug a hole.'it is quite clear that the intended sense of malab- 'make, construct' is 'dig'. It
should be noted that potential ambiguities are rarely if ever rcsolvctl by
paraphrase in actual texts (cf. Dixon 1972:293). And I suspect that this is partly
because in real terms the ambiguity of a contextualised utterance is usually
relatively small, and far less than the potential ambiguity, and partly because
vagueness is an inherent semantic characteristic, and not just a formal fc.altlrc of
the avoidance style.","[31, 32, 33]"
"A corresponding tenn for clauses used in the second major function of
exchange of goods and services is the term PROPOSAL, following Halliday
(1985:71). Here the speaker proposes, rather than asserts, the propositional
content of the clause. This proposal amounts to a suggestion that the
propositional content should be true, thereby offering his assurance that it will
be true (i.e. the speaker proposes to effect the necessary actions), or
requests/demands that the addressee make the propositional content true (by
effecting the necessary actions).
There is another 'speech-act' type in which the clause is used neither to
convey information nor to exchange goods and services: EXCLAMATIONS.
Again, they have no distinctive formal properties, although, as for ""questions"",
there is an enclitic, namely -woo DEF which means roughly 'defmitely, exactly',
which frequently occurs in this speech act type. For examples, see section 6.3.9
and section 6.5.3.3.
All situation and non-situation clauses may be used in the exchange of
information, i.e. in assertions. A proper subset of these may also be used in
proposals. For example, characterising and identifying relational (non-situation)
clauses do not occur as proposals, although existential clauses may - see
example (5-33) above; nor, at least in the present corpus, do situation clauses
whose VPs are in the past tense.
From the point of view of its propositional content, a major clause
consists of an obligatory Proposition, and an optional Propositional Modifier.
The 'simple' Proposition is realised by a clause consisting of the following
types of unit: NP, PP, VP, and/or ADV. (That is, the 'simple' Proposition is
that part of the clause which in experiential tenns refers to a situation or a384THE CLAUSErelationship.) Thus, for example, a 'simple' clause such as
(5-246) nganyi -ngga manyi wanJJa

ERG food I:brought:it
'I brought food.'
consists of the Proposition nganyingga manyi wardla 'I brought food'. A
Propositional Modifier may be realised by a particle or an adverbial. A clause

Propositional Modifier, the clause is being viewed from the perspective of its
role as an interactive event in the speech situation. That is, the Proposition and
the Propositional Modifier are interpersonal roles in the clause. This follows
from the fact that the propositional content of the clause is that which
contextualises as an assertion, a proposal, or an exclamation, within the speech
situation it occurs in. It is that aspect of the meaning of the clause exchanged
between the speaker and the hearer. The role of Propositional Modifier is thus a
modal one, indicating some sort of qualification of the Proposition.
There appear to be three main ways in which the proposition expressed by
a clause may be modified: (a) objective, in which the 'logical' status of the
proposition is modified; (b) subjective, in which the speaker's attitude towards
the logical status of the proposition is indicated; and (c) expectation
modification, in which the proposition is placed within the expectations of the
interlocutors. Table 5-1 sets out the main lexemes functioning in these three
types of propositional modification.","[367, 368]"

6.4 for a detailed discussion of the significance of the terms.)
Clearly most of the words in Table 5-l do not have modal-type meanings. Rather,
what is being claimed is that they may play modal roles in the clauses in which
they occur.
The lexemes under Expectation require some comment. Scalar is used
following McConvell (1983a) in reference to the situation in which the expected
is ranked with respect to the asserted. For example, in
(5-248) winhi danymiliyidda mangaddi milayidda
just
we:heard:it
not
we:saw:it
'We only heard it, we didn't see it.'
the asserted p:roposition, that we heard it, is ranked lower than the expectation
that we should have seen it. (For further discussion see below sections 6.3.3,
6.3.5, 6.4.7, and 6.4.8.)The temporal adverbials are not only used in locating processes in timealthough this might be seen as their unmarked function - but they are also used
in modifying propositions with respect to expectations. For example, ngamoo
'before' normally occurs in contrast with other time expressions such as
gaddwaroo 'afternoon, yesterday', e.g. in ""frames"" such as:386THE CLAUSE(5-249)ngamoogaddigmibeforeit:fmishedgaddwaroo
afternoon
jamoondoo
other.day
'(The rain) fmished before/yesterday/the other day.'
Such sentences constitute plain responses to information requests such asyaningimi gaddigmi 'When did it finish?' (='It finished sometime'). It is
presupposed that 'the rain stopped sometime'. However, ngamoo before' may
also occur in a contrasting set with mangaddi 'no, not', yiganyi 'uncertain', etc.:
(5-250)ngamoogaddigmibeforeit: finishedmangaddi
notyiganyi
uncertain
'(The rain) has already/not/perhaps finished.'
In this case, these sentences are not plain responses to information requests (i.e.
When did it happen?'). Rather, they are appropriate to a context in which the
status of the Proposition expressed by gaddigmi - '(the rain) has fmished' - is
called to question for some reason. The clause ngamoo gaddigmi (example
(5-250)) occurred in such a situation. The speaker had asserted his belief that the
rain would stop sometime later on in the day. However, on going outside, he
found that it had already stopped raining, upon which he uttered the clause. The
point of the utterance was not to indicate WHEN the rain had stopped, but rather
that it had ALREADY stopped. The first embodies a presupposition that the rain
had already stopped, which was certainly not the case when this clause was
uttered. The presupposition was the negation of this, that the rain had not (yet)
ceased.
The remaining lexeme (see Table 5-1), which I have labeled as a frequency
adverbial, occurs when there is some expectation to the contrary, i.e. an
expectation that the situation does not always occur. Otherwise, in the absence
of such expectations, it would not be used; instead, a more neutral mode of
expression (involving present tense in the VP) would be used- see below
section 6.5.1.2.","[368, 369, 370]"

'No, I'm looking for a camp.' (Answer to What are you doing?')(There are no examples of woomoorla 'not, without' used as a Propositional
Modifying minor clause (see section 5.4.2).)
It remains unclear whether or not woomoorla 'not, without' is an avoidance
equivalent of both mangaddi 'not' and marlami 'nothing, without'. It certainly
seems to cover the range of senses of mar/ami 'nothing, without' - but it is not
clear whether in its apparent role of negating clauses (as in example (6-145)) it
realises the role of Propositional Modifier, or some circumstantial role. That
mangaddi 'not' itself occurs in avoidance style utterances and mar/ami 'nothing,
without' does not, perhaps suggests that woomoorla 'not, without' is an
equivalent of marlami 'nothing, without' only.","[479, 480]"
"There is one context in which -mi ~ -ma IND may arguably function as a root
formative. The d-word yaningimi 'when, sometime' is obviously constructed from
yaningi 'then, at that time, now', together with -mi IND. Whereas -mi IND
normally indicates a possibility, and is typically used in requesting confirmation
or disconfirmation, yaningimi is normally used in requesting information,
temporal location, rather than a yes/no reply. That is, it appears to belong
paradigmatically with the indefinite determiners ngoorndoo 'someone, who', etc ..
There is one piece of formal evidence that provides support for the
hypothesis of lexicalisation of yaningimi 'when, sometime'. This comes from the
fact that another instance of -mi - -ma IND may occur in the same clause:
(6-108) yaningimi
ward -ma -wiri
sometime/when go
IND
you:will:go
'When might you go?', or 'Maybe you'll go sometime.'
Otherwise, only one instance of -mi - -ma IND may occur in any clause.
Note that in Bunuba there is an unanalysable lexeme meaning 'when' (Alan
Rumsey, pers. comm.). It is possible that yaningimi is a constructed form,
perhaps invented to replace a lexeme proscribed by a death taboo.",[470]
"1.4.2 Social organisation
In Gooniyandi culture as in other Aboriginal cultures, interpersonal and
intergroup rights, obligations, duties and behaviour were, and still are, to a large
extent determined by ""kin"" relationships. The 'kindred' is perceived as
coterminous with society. And, partly because of this, the kin-relation between a
pair of individuals is usually to some extent negotiable, and not as fixed by
actual genealogy as it is for Westerners.
Gooniyandi has a sizeable system of kin-terms. There are over twentyGOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIEfY13unmarked or simple kin-terms, all of which are used in both reference and address
(there are no morphologically distinct vocative forms). These may be suffixed
with one of two possessor indicating morphemes -wa 'his/her' and -badi 'yours'
(number of the possessed is not indicated). There are no forms for other
possessors, such as first person or third person non-singular; these must be
indicated by a possessive pronoun. There is also a suffix -langi which forms
dyadic terms. When added to the appropriate simple term, it refers to a group of
two or more individuals in the designated kin-relation to one another. In addition
to the simple kin-terms, there is a small set of 'triangular' terms, which indicate
the relation of both the speaker and a distinct propositus, usually the addressee,
to the referent. (For a discussion of triangular terms, see McConvell 1982 and
Laughren 1982.) The system of triangular terms is restricted to configurations in
which at least one of the relationships is affinal. Some of the distinctions made
in tltc simple system are neutralised in this system.
The Gooniyandi kinship system is a variant of the Arremte (Aranda) type
(Radcliffe-Brown 1931), in which four kinds of kin are distinguished in the
grand-parental generation (cf. Scheffler 1978: chapter 9). In Aranda systems, two
different types of cross-cousin are usually distinguished terminologically: first
cross-cousin, and second cross-cousin, the latter being a prescribed spouse of
Ego, and designated 'spouse'. In Gooniyandi, however, certain cross-cousins are
designated goorndi (females) and goornda (males), which terms also apply to first
cross-cousins (i.e. FZCh and MBCh), and marriage was proscribed. The first
choice of spouse is from the same subsection as the actual MMBDCh and
FMBSCh (provided the marriages were all first preference - see below).
However, s/he must be distant from Ego: a classificatory and not an actual crosscousin. Speakers explained this to me in geographical terms: marriage with a
classificatory second cross-cousin living in a distant place would be acceptable,
whereas marriage wilh a second cross-cousin residing nearby would be
unacceptable. This may perhaps suggest a predilection for local group exogamy.
(Compare Elkin 1938/1974:101 and Rumsey 1982a:161-162.) Summing up,
genealogy (or imputed genealogy) is not the only factor determining the kinterms actually used in particular speaker-referent-(proposilus) situations.
Distance, which is likely to be a more complex factor than mere geographical
distance (see Rumsey 1982a;162), is also taken into account.
Genealogy and distance may conflict, and the present evidence indicates that
such conflicts need not be definitely resolved one way or the other once and for
all. Rather, where there is such a conflict, the choice of kin-term applied (and
presumably also the interpersonal behaviour) may depend on context. For14INTRODUCTIONexample, in formal elicitation sessions, not surprisingly, genealogy is the main
factor determining choice of kin-term and defining appropriate behaviour, while
distance plays a subsidiary role. In other contexts, such as speaking of initiation,
distance may emerge as the pivotal factor. For instance, in speaking of his own
initiation, my main teacher referred to the men of the jawandi subsection, who
he would normally call ngaboo 'father', as nyaanyi 'mother's brother, etc.'. This
was because they were his mother's countrymen, and thus her brothers, not her
spouses. (When questioned about this in a later elicitation session, my teacher
denied ever calling ajawandi man nyaanyi!)
Elkin (1938/1974:103) distinguishes another system, the Alurija (Luritja)
system, in which there is a merging of cross-cousins with siblings: in this
system the cross-cousin of Ego's M and F are called by the same term as their
siblings, MZ, MB and FZ, FB respectively. This is precisely the merging found
in the Gooniyandi system, when the distance is small. Moreover, there is
occasional merging of cross-cousin and sibling. In one case I encountered, two
individuals who should have called one another goornda, preferred to use ngaja
'younger brother'- their mothers were countrywomen, and hence sisters. (Note
that actual MMBD becomes a ngaddanyi 'mother', and so her children become
siblings: these cross-cousins are always treated as siblings.)
These two factors, genealogy and distance, are by no means the only ones
that may be relevant in a particular socio-cultural circumstance. To give one
example, the opposition of generation levels- same or alternate vs. adjacentis important in the context of disposal of the dead. As there is no term for
alternate generation sets in Gooniyandi, those of the same generation as the dead
are referred to as marna-wa (older:brother-his) 'his (older) brother'. the others as
joogoo-wa (child-his) 'his children'.
The Gooniyandi social universe - including everyone they have close
social interaction with -is divided into eight classes which anthropologists call
subsections, the terms for which are shown in Table 1-1.
The subsections are referred to in the local form of Aboriginal English and
English based varieties as ""skins"", and in Gooniyandi as gooroo. The subsection
system is today found over a large geographical area, including the southern
Kimberley and much of the Northern Territory. The terms are strikingly similar,
sometimes even identical, over quite large areas (McConvell 1985a:66).
There are distinct terms for the males and females of each subsection, the
terms being in most instances transparent cognates. The male terms all have an
initialjV, while the female terms have initial nV or nyV, where the vowel V,
which must be either /a/ or /oo/, is usually identical with the vowel of the15GOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIETY-Table 1-I: The subsections

"5.4.2 Minor clauses
A class of MINOR clauses may be identified, which have no independent
propositional content. Minor clauses cannot be used as assertions. As opposed
to major clauses (with the single exception of existential relational clauses),392THE CLAUSEminor clauses may be characterised as those without a nexus. Evidently for a
clause to have propositional content, and to be used as a vehicle for the
independent communication of information it must involve a nexus (of course
one of the elements of this nexus may be ellipsed).
Although minor clauses cannot be used in making assertions, they may be
used in proposals and exclamations. The prototypical minor clause consists of
an interjection. Some, like ba 'come on, let's go', nya 'here you are', and bay
'eh?' are used as proposals. (The last of these is used in the elicitation of a
linguistic response and so is a proposal.) Others, like ngay, yay 'hey!', warawoo
'youtch', etc. are used in exclamations only.
Words from all classes except for verbals may realise minor clauses of
these two types; nominals are quite frequently used in this function. In a minor
clause a nominal may be used as a vocative- e.g. yoowooloo! 'Man!'; and the
subsection terms are frequently used as vocatives, e.g. jawandi!, in calling to a
person of the jawandi subsection. Since their aim is to at least gain the
addressee's attention, vocatives could be considered to be proposals.
Less frequently, nominals are used in exclamations. For example, girlinggi
'penis' and nyaninyi 'vagina' are used at least these days as rough equivalents to
'prick' and 'cunt' respectively. Other than use in swearing, a nominal minor
clause may be used e.g. to draw attention to something, such as a snake, or
alcohol: barlanyi! 'snake!', gamba! 'water, grog'.
Another function that a minor clause may serve is to modify the
propositional content of a (usually) preceding clause. The interjections yoowayi,
yoowoo 'yes', and particles such as mar/ami 'nothing', mangaddi 'not, no', etc.
may realise such roles.
5.5 Non-finite clausesNon-finite clauses constitute a class of impoverished clauses which consist of an
obligatory non-finite verb, sometimes together with an NP, PP, or adverbial.
The non-finite verb (Vnr) distinguishes none of the person, number, tense, or
modal categories of the finite VP. It consists of a verbal root or stem, optionally
followed by an infinitive (see section 5.5.3), or by the progressive aspect
marker.
That there is no classifier means that there is less specificity in referring to the
Process. For example, the verbal root ngarag- can mean either 'work on', or
'make, complete', depending on the choice of classifier. This distinction cannot
be made in the non-fmite verb.","[375, 376]"

"There are, however, a few unpredictable pairings.
(I) A couple of verbals (e.g. barn~ 'return', bar- tclimb up') which are
classified by +BINDI refer to typically active processes of motion reaching a
ITOPICS IN SEMANTICS570goal. Because of the restricted range of occurrence of+BINDI, it is not possible
to explicitly refer to the accomplishment of these processes where the Actor is
of nonwsingular number. In this event, different lexical choices are made. Instead
of barn- 'return' and bar- 'climb up', the verbals balbidd- '(many) return' and
baward- '(many) climb up' occur. These latter occur only with non-singular
Mediums, and are classified by +MI only. They are in complementary
distribution with barn- 'return' and bar- 'climb up.'
(2) In just a couple of cases a lexeme occurs with +Ml where +BINDI is
expected: booboob- 'swell up (e.g. of a lump)', and bitha- 'get stiff. One would
expect these processes to be unmarked for active.
The relationships among ~e accomplishment classifiers may be conveniently
explained by a feature system which specifies the formal semantic content of
each classifier. We have seen that these classifiers fall into two primary subsets,
which are distinguishable by the fact that one set (the bottom right hand cell of
Table 6-2) indicates that the process is active, while the other set leaves this
unspecified. This can be captured by the feature [active], which can take on the
values positive or unmarked.
It is also clear that +ANI and +BINDI positively specify the process as not
extending from the Medium, but as being entirely immanent. The other
classifiers (except for +ADDI) do not indicate whether or not the process extends
out from the Actor. (About a quarter of the initial list of around 130 lexemes
occurring with +MI involved action entirely immanent in the Actor/Medium;
these lexemes never occurred in transitive clauses (with +MI at least).) This can
be captured by the feature [non-extensive], which like [active] takes on values+
(positive) or u (unmarked).
The two sets of classifiers may be characterised as follows:
non~extensive] +ANI, +BINDI
[+
u.acttveno~-extensive] +Ml, +BINI, +DI, +ADDI, +ARNI1, +BIRLI
[ u.
+active
Although logically only one feature is required to distinguish the two sets, it
seems that a single feature could not do justice to the known facts. The
classifiers from both sets actually have positive semantic content. Furthermore,
recognition of these two features allows +MARNI to be characterised in a

natura1way as +nonextensive]
+active
. (Th'1s fieature spec1.fi1catmn
correctly mdtcates
[the relative markedness of +MARNI with respect to the other accomplishmentVERBAL CATEGORIES571classifiers.)
It will be clear from the foregoing that the equivalence between the contrast
on the one hand between +I and +A in the extendibles, and on the other between
+ANI and +BIND!, and +Ml, +DI, +BINI, etc. in the accomplishments, which
is suggested by Table 6-2 does not obtain. +I and +A appear to be in privative
opposition, marked respectively as [-extensive] and [+extensive].

[+juncture/disjuncture of Goal and other entity]
[+straight-line action of agent on Goal]
[+consumption of Medium]+MI must be assumed to be unmarked for each of these features, and each of the
five classifiers must be assumed to be unmarked for the features of the others.
The first assumption is necessary because there exist processes which are
classified by +MI but which satisfy (or appear to) the positive specifications
above. The second assumption is necessary because these positive specifications
do not impose mutually exclusive classifications on the class of processes: a
process could well satisfy two or more of them, in which instance it is by no
means clear what motivates the choice between the equally appropriate
classifiers.
+BINDI and +ANI would seem to be in a relation of equipollent
opposition, the former being [achievement final], the latter, [achievement initial]
- see discussion under (d) and (e) above. It appears that the two impose
mutually exclusive classifications on the set of processes they encompasswhich is not to say that they divide the verballexemes into disjoint sets. That
is, it is not necessary to assume that each is unmarked with respect to a feature
of the other, as was the case among the [+active] classifiers. Furthennore, there
is no evidence that the relationship between them is privative. For these reasons,
it is assumed to be equipollent.
The accomplishment classifiers impose a rather loose semantic
classification on the set of accomplishment processes, in the sense that nearly
all of the oppositions are between positive values of a feature, and unmarked for
that feature. Given a particular process it is not nonnally possible to accurately572TOPICS IN SEMANTICSpredict the classifier that will mark the verbal root: often more than one
classifier is consistent with the relevant characteristics of the process. (For
example, we saw above that the process of returning to a starting point may be
classified by either +BINDI or +MI- it is an active and non-extensive process.)
As was suggested above, it seems that as a general rule the most infonnative
classifier consistent with the process will be chosen. This is, however, a only a
tendency, and there are a number of instances in which a verbal root is classified ·
by +MI, rather than by an (apparently) applicable more specific classifier. For
example, it might be expected that +DI would classify thalig- 'attach spear to
woomera'; however, only +MI occurs with this root. The unpredictability of
classifier choice has been accounted for here as a consequence of the types of
semantic opposition between the classifiers. But the pairings of classifier and
process do not as far as I know contradict the semantic analysis presented above.
And the major predictive value of the proposed analysis lies in its ability, given
that a particular root occurs with n different classifiers and with n distinct
meanings, to predict which meanings will be associated with which root~
classifier pairings.","[550, 551, 552, 553]"

of paradigms, and requests for implausible utterances (such as 'you died') were
frequently met with by resistance such as boredom, and, less frequently. re~sal to
produce the requested form. More interestingly, the entities I established m my
English prompts were treated as belonging to the participant-register of the
discourse, and where possible, treated as ""given"" (Halliday 1970: 162). Speakers
did not like being forced to translate the English NPs verbatim (see also below
page 251 and section 5.3.1). It is clear that speakers regarded the elicitation
process as text-producing, and their responses were characteristic of genres
appropriate to the referential content. Much of the formally elicited data is, then,
in a sense controlled, or constructed text, rather than isolated, decontextualised
sentences. The primary thrust of elicitation was to develop and construct such
contexts as might not frequently arise in conditions where recording was possible.
Because elicitation is text-producing, and because many morphemes and
morpheme combinations are unlikely to arise in free texts, I do not even aspire to
Heath's (1984:4) ideal of a ""corpus-based grammar"" (where 'corpus' includes free
!t•xts only). Although I am mindful of the many dangers inherent in using elicited
materials. I cannot concur with Heath's assessment that he had "" ... no confidence
whatever in such data, since my own early ""data"" of this type often turned out to
be: seriously wrong"" (Heath 1984:5). As I will discuss later, I feel that this
mtsrepresents the nature of linguistic data, by taking it to be an observable
Clbject, independent of the observer.
By far the most problematic aspects of elicitation seem to me to relate to
the practices of seeking speakers' judgements of utterance acceptability (see
~low), and their intuitions and explanations of meaning differences. In the
mcumstances of ~y field:vork these did not prove to be very satisfactory field
~etho~s. and I av?t~ed !herr usc as much as possible. As a rule, in those instances
~~ W~tch two dtshnct forms might conceivably refer to the same referent
Sltuauon, speakers were unable to pin-point the subtle distinctions in meaning
conv~yed ?Y the variant modes of expression. I was invariably informed that no
meamng dtfference existed.ln the ~ourse of producing material for the Gooniyandi language
~rogram~ne m the Yiyili Community School (see section 1.8), I had
c pponu~1ty to ca:efully check my transcriptions of a number of words, and my
P~~l~t'm 1.~ ~nalys1s. Careful.auention was paid to 'problem areas', especially: (I)
dtsttngmshmg between ap1co-alveolar, apico-postalveolar and lamino-dental
consonant.~. which I experienced great difficulty in telling apart (since then I
have. fm:nd that the phonetic contrasts in Gooniyandi are not as perceptible to
the English car as are tlle phonetic contrasts between the corresponding segmentsDATA USED IN THIS INVESTIGATION35in some other Australian languages); and (2) the question of whether the cont.rnst
between apico-alveolars and apico-postalveolars is neutralised word initia1ly (as
it is in many Australian languages). Many words were checked with more than
one speaker, and over more than one repetition (successively and on different
occasions), using both auditory and visual evidence. From this work, I produced
a dictionary of about I 000 items, the phonemic representation of which I am
relatively confident. This dictionary, which includes all items of Hale's 100 word
list, the relevant items of Douglas (1959/1977), as well as all words from the
texts chosen for the school book, and a number of 'suspicious' and crucial words,
is the primary data base for the statistical analysis of phoneme distributions
(section 2.2.5).
The investigation into tlw textual organisation of the clause (section 5.3),
as well as a significant part of the study of the clause complex (section 5.6), is
based primarily on textual material. (Initial hypotheses were, however,
formulated on the basis of the elicited corpus.) From a large corpus of twenty or
more hours of recorded texts, fifteen texts were selected for close scrutiny; three
of these appear in Appendix I. These fifteen texts, which were chosen more or
less at random- and not for any reac;ons of their merit as coherent texts- are
monologues encompassing all genres represented in the corpus. There is no
reason to b~lieve that they are not typical representatives of their genres. They
were narrated by three different individuals, including the youngest and the oldest
speakers. The chosen texts vary in length from about a minute and a half to over
ten minutes, in all totaling about forty-five minutes. Altogether there are alXlllt
800 clauses. The texts had been transcribed word for word in the field with the
assistance of the speaker; most had also been worked over on at least one
occasion with another native speaker. I studied them again away from the field,
attempting to identify and mark in significant suprascgmental features, which I
was convinced played an important role in the organisation of the text as a
message bearing unit (sec section 5.3).
The reader will notice that no sentences are starred as unacceptable or
ungrammatical in this grammar. The present description is based entirely on
occurring, and ipso facto acceptable, sentences. Problems in eliciting acceptance
or rejection of conslructed examples arc well known, and I will not go into them
here- but see for example Bolinger (1968), Christie (1980), Haas (1973), and
Quirk and Svartvik (1966). Suffice it to make Lhe following three observations,
specific to the context of my research. Firstly, speakers were as a rule unwilling
to label utterances I produced a<> unacceptable - rather than respond to the actual
form of my utterance, they almost invariably presumed that I intended to express36INTRODUCTIONsome meaning, and attempted to determine and respond appropriately to that.
And secondly, on the other hand, in more than one instance in which a speaker
had firmly rejected an invented example, he later used the same construction
himself. The reasons for the initial rejection always remained unclear to me.
Finally, my theoretical purpose is not, and was not, to delimit the class of
grammatical sentences (if indeed such a class is well defined - cf. Hocketl
1967), but rather to describe and account for the meaning potential of
Gooniyandi utterances.","[46, 47, 48, 49]"

Consonant assimilations in the CC affect apicals only, and are both progressive
(i.e. they assimilate to a preceding segment) and regressive (i.e. assimilating to a
following segment). Both may apply in a single sequence. The rules are:

consonant (In/ is in fact the only consonant lrl follows within the CC). I have
marked the feature of [+retroflex] on the following vowel since it does show up
in one circumstance, namely the one indicated in the environment of CCR4: that
is, when it can progressively 'attach' to a following consonant, provided that it
is an apical. For example,

2.4.2.2.1.3PrenasalisationThe palatal stop {j} is prenasalised in the second person singular when it is

first person plural prefixes jidd- and jadd-. The rule might be tentatively
formulated as follows:
CCR8 j~nyj/V+ _ _ V1[:gular]
It is tempting to also seek an explanation for other second person forms in104PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGYterms of prenasalisation. The second person plural has an initial /ngg/, which is
also found in an allornorph of the second person singular. This may well be a
prenasalisation of the initial segment of the second person plural form gidi 'you
plural'· Moreover. prenasalisation might explain the otherwise exceptional
second person singular accusative form ngim-, which occurs only in
combination with a third person plural nominative pronominal form.
{mila -ngim
see
(2sg)A+bidd +a} ~ /milangimbidda/
+(3pl)N +A'they saw you'A hypothetical derivation for -ngimbidd+ might go as follows. Let us assume
that the regular allomorphs -nggi+ and -bidd+ of (2sg)A and (3pl)N respectively
are chosen: this gives the form -nggi+bidd+. Then, if a prenasalisation rule like
CCR8 were to apply to the {b}, -nggimbidd+ would be derived. Now a
dissimilation rule may be applied to eliminate the succession of two prenasalised
stops within a single word (in the manner of R7, except that it operates in the
opposite direction. backwards instead of forwards). Then ngimbidd+ would
result.
Although derivations such as these appear to be reasonable historical
sources for the second person forms, they are not synchronically useful. They do
not provide a more general description than does the plain statement of
allomorphy. Consequently, I accept -nggi+, -nggim+, -nggidd+ and -nggin+ as
base forms of the second person pronominal prefixes.

"5.6.2.2.3 Enhancement
Here the relationship between the subordinate clause and the constituent it
modifies is a circumstantial one of place. That is, the thing referred to by the
modified constituent (either a nominal phrase, or an adverbial) fulfils a
circumstantial role of location in the enhancing clause; by contrast, in extension
(5.6.2.2.1) the thing fulfils a participant role in the extending clause, or is a part
of a participating entity. The clausal constituent modified may be either a
nominal phrase (NP or PP), or a spatial adverbial, referring to (or implying) a443CLAUSE COMPLEXESplace. The enhancing clause (like the extending clause discussed above) always
occurs in final position in the clause complex, typically next to the constituent
of the primary clause that it modifies. That is, the qualified referent is normally
new, and the unmarked focus of the primary clause - and as such it always
finds overt realisation in that clause. (It is of course normally ellipsed in the
following enhancing clause.) Furthermore, the enhancing clause is inv~bly in
the factive mood. This clause always occurs in final position in the clause
complex, usually next to the modified constituent in the primary clause. An
example is

5.6.2.2.4 Concluding remarks
We have seen that as a rule the elaborating clause and the subclausal constituent
it modifies (in case it is not ellipsed) are as a rule immediately next to one
another. They might be regarded as juxtaposed; however, the two do not together
form a unit complex, as is the case in other juxtapositions. The clause either
precedes the constituent it modifies, or follows it. These possibilities appear to
be another reflection of Bolinger's (1967) distinction between referent and
reference modification (discussed above, section 4.1.2.2). As was the case within444THE CLAUSEthe NP, material preceding the referring expression (in the primary clause) serves
to modify its reference, whilst material following it serves to modify the
referent5.6.2.3 Linguistic significance of the types
The full range of logico-semantic and tactic relations that exist between the
clauses of a complex are schematised in the following table.

To conclude this discussion of clause complexes I will briefly enquire into
the linguistic status of the above relationships, addressing the question as toClAUSE COMPLEXES445whether the types merely interpretations engendered by the context, and have. no
linguistic significance (cf. Hale 1976:86, and McKay 1988). I will look atthe
tactic relationships frrst, then at the logico-semantic ones.
In all clause types identified in the table, one clause, the PRIMARY clause;
carries the main burden of the message. The other clause(s) carry less important
information, and will be referred to as SECONDARY clauses. Parataxis and
hypotaxis may be distinguished in terms of the order relationships that may
obtain between the primary and secondary clauses.
In clause complexes of the types listed in the frrst column of Table 5-2,
the primary clause is the one which comes frrsl In enhancement, the enhancing
clause, which always comes second, expresses a situation secondary to the
situation enhanced upon. (Where the situations are temporally successive, the
most important one is the one occurring frrst: in general, the occurrence of the
second is dependent on the occurrence of the frrst. Furthermore, I would argue
that the fact that the clauses are conjoined indicates that the speaker does evaluate
the event frrst to occur as the most important; otherwise, s/he could have chosen
to use two isolated clause-sentences.) In the case of addition, as in English, the
first clause expresses the situation that the speaker evaluates as the most
important: in (5-366) the most important part of the message concerns getting
the hearer to do something. Similar remarks apply to the other relations of in
the parataxis column. At frrst sight it may appear that in identification the
opposite order occurs, i.e. that the secondary precedes the primary clause: here
the identifying clause, which corresponds to relative clauses in languages such as
English, always occurs first. But closer examination of the facts shows that this
type does not in fact contradict the ordering principle. This type typically occurs
in the context in which the identifying clause carries the new infonnation, and
the following clause carries given information. Consider for example (5-223)
above, in which the final clause of B's response is information given in A's
question.
It is clear that in clause complexes of the types listed in the second column
of Table 5-2, the primary clause is always the one in unmarked (or indicative)
mood; the secondary clause is always the one in a marked non-indicative mood.
Here clause order has nothing to do with the primary/secondary opposition;
where reversal of the order of the clauses is possible, it does not change the
status of the clauses as primary or secondary. This suggests the inherent
secondary status of clauses in non-indicative moods in these types of clause
complex. The clauses are of unequal status. On the other hand, the fact that
reversal of clauses in complexes from the first column of the table induces a446THE ClAUSEchange in the relative status of the clauses indicates their equal footing. This
justifies the distinction between parataxis and hypotaxis.
Turning now to the logical relationships, we fmd that in hypotactic clause
complexes the enhancing relationship of location may be distinguished from the
others by virtue of the fact that the order of clauses is fixed in the former, but
not in the latter relationships. In location, the subordinate clause always follows
the main clause; in the other hypotactic types, the subordinate clause more often
than not precedes the main clause. Condition is morphologically distinct from
identification and time, except in the future tense, where both condition and time
are realised by a subjunctive clause (I will return to this shortly). Identification
and time can be distinguished as follows: if there is, initial in the main clause,
an endophoric word referring to (and/or summarising) the subordinate clause, it
must be a determiner in identification, and the adverbial miga 'thus, in thus
manner' in time. In other words, identification and time are sometimes formally
distinct, and are in principle distinguishable. Similarly, it should be possible to
distinguish future temporals from future conditionals by the endophoric element
that may occur initially in the main clause. And it seems that only temporals
allow the adverbial miga 'thus, in thus manner'. The discussion of this paragraph
shows that the logical types in hypotaxis identified in the previous section have
linguistic validity as covert categories: they are distinguishable by agnation, and
not by form alone.
Things are not so clear for the various types of paratactic complexes, and it
is beyond the scope of this book to determine whether each of the logical types
identified above are linguistically significant. I will merely remark on the
statuses of constituent descriptives, constituent identification, and clausal
temporal inclusion. Identification stands out from the other paratactic
relationships by virtue of the fact that one of the endophoric determiners may
come initially in the secondary clause, and refer to the thing identified by the
primary clause. It would seem that constituent descriptives and clauses related by
temporal inclusion overlap, but do not coincide: clause complexes admitting the
latter interpretation admit the former only if the clauses share a nominal
constituent. Furthermore, neither of these two types appears to display a
linguistic property distinguishing them from clausal addition.
But constituent identification in parataxis stands out from the remaining
paratactic relations in other ways. Identification is the only logical relationship
common to both parataxis and hypotaxis. Indeed, paratactic identification may be
grouped together with hypotactic identification, conditionals, and temporals, in
terms of textual structure. In each of these the expanding clause typically comesCLAUSE COMPLEXES447first, and would appear to function as a type of thematic clause in the complex,
establishing a thing involved in, a place at which, a time when, or a condition
under which the situation referred to by the primary clause did or may occur. The
thing established may be referred to by an initial endophoric element in the
following, main clause. This makes the construction reminiscent of the thematic
option of reprise (cf. above page 375, and Grimes 1975). As we have seen, such
initial subordinate clauses always occur on their own, typically fall-rise;
intonation contour. This may be compared with the rising tone on reprised nonclausal themes (page 374 above).
For each of the types identified in the preceding paragraph, final position
for the expanding clause is far less frequent, and this clause may reasonably be
regarded as a type of afterthought, added to clarify an omitted (or ellipsed) theme;
the tone typically falls throughout, and is usually lower than the tone of the
primary clause. Thus, as suggested above, the two types of constituent
elaboration, characterisation and clarification, are merely thematic variants of
identification. The subordinate types are typically added when the theme is
something which has gone before, or is a presupposition, but which the speaker
ascertains the hearer may have difficulty in identifying; the paratactic type adds
new information of a peripheral nature. The four types, paratactic constituent
elaboration, hypotactic constituent elaboration, hypotactic conditionals, and
hypotactic temporals, may be grouped together and distinguished from the
remaining types by virtue of their possession of a theme-rheme structure. They
are thus in a sense more tightly structured, and more clause-like than the other
types.
It is now clear that a number of the types distinguished in the above
discussion do in fact have linguistic significance. This was shown by (1) formal
differences in the choice of moods and resuming determiners; (2) differences in
the significance of clause order; and (3) the fact that the class of complex
sentences allowing a particular interpretation differs from the class allowing
another interpretation. It remains true that many particular clause complex
tokens are multiply ambiguous. Presumably the interpretations are influenced by
the context of the text and the speech situation in which the particular complex
occurs. To take one example, (5-430) occurred in a context in which my
collaborator and I were discussing the previous work on the Gooniyandi
language. No previous mention had been made of this particular white person.

In this context, the first two interpretations are the most likely. Since the white
person had not yet been mentioned, the speaker might have intended that the frrst
clause establish such an individual, and mention as a further observation that
this man had died (in fact, the speaker was wrong here). Alternatively, he may
not have intended that the person be established in this way, but his identity left
indefinite, the point of the utterance being that although someone had previously
worked on the language, this was quite a while ago. If, however, the discourse
had been concerned with the exploits of a particular white person, the third
reading would be the most likely one. Naturally there are formal correlates of the
discourse and speech situation factors, showing up in the order of words in the
constituent clauses, whether or not they are ellipsed, etc. (cf. Merlan
1981:188ff). We cannot here attempt to identify factors influencing the
interpretations of particular examples.","[426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432]"
"26INTRODUCilONA Gooniyandi language programme has been in operation in Gogo School,
a primary school with predominantly Gooniyandi pupils, since 1987 · It seems
to be progressing successfully, and is popular with the children. .
Other Government schools in the Kimberley region - of which La Grange
School is the most notable example - have recently started language
programmes. However, the Western Australian Education Department la~ks a
policy on bilingual/bicultural education, and these initiatives are at the whim of
the school principal. This, together with the consequent unavailability of
professional expertise both in matters of linguistic description and in
establishing and running language programmes, and lack of funds, has certainly
done nothing to improve the chances of success of any language programme. To
date, only Catholic Education in the Kimberley has a language policy, and
employs linguists to implement it.
In 1982 the Yiyili Community School, independently run by that
Community, started operation. At that time it employed one white school
teacher, Robyn Dickinson. The community felt that, in addition to educating
their children in English and mathematics, education in their own language and
culture was equally important. One of the aims of the school (to quote from the
School Policy) is ""To develop and introduce a Gooniyandi language and literacy
progmmme"".
During my 1982 field trip the Yiyili Community requested my assistance
as a linguist. I spent a few weeks at Yiyili, during which time I devised a
practical orthography for Gooniyandi, and produced some introductory materials
for their programme, including a preliminary draft of a collection of Gooniyandi
stories, a short dictionary, and a brief description of the principles of writing the
language, intended for literate Aborigines and teachers involved in the
programme. In 1983 the Yiyili Community employed a Summer Institute of
Linguistics (SIL) linguist, Joyce Hudson, on a part-time basis, to initiate the
language programme in their school. In the following year, Annette Walker,
another SIL linguist, took over this job, but left due to her marriage. From then
until 1988 no linguist was employed, and the language programme ceased
operation. In 1988 it was begun again, with the assistance of Barbara Jones, a
teacher-linguist for the Kimberley Language Resource Centre.
F~udson produced some basic literacy materials, and developed the
followmg orthography, in consultation with two literate native speakers, David
Street and Topsy Chestnut (Street and Chestnut 1984:4, Hudson I984a, 1984b):
Vowels: a, ar {long a), i, ii (long i), oa (short and long IPA u);EDUCATIONANDORTHOGRAPHY27Consonants: b, m (bilabials); d, n, I (apico-alvelolars); 4.. ll. L r (apicodomals); th, nh, lh (lamino-dentals); j, ny, ly (lamina-palatals);
g. ng (dorso-velars); and w, y (semi-vowels).
This orthography was designed principally in order to facilitate the transfer of
literacy skills from English (although personally I do not feel that it went far
enough in this direction). It is not phonemic. The symbol d, for example,
represents two distinct phonemes: the apico-alvcolar stop, and the apico-alveolar
tap or trill. Elsewhere the system over differentiates, in distinguishing the long
ii vowel sound from both the short i and the sequence iyi (sec section 2.1.6. 1),
and a !amino-dental lateral, which to the best of my knowledge occurs only as a
conditioned variant of the lamino-palatallatcral (section 2.1.5.2).
It seems that there is a very positive attitude towards this orthography
among both staff and students. However, the fact that it is non-phonemic makes
it inappropriate and cumbersome for a work of this nature. And since there is no
substantial body of literature written in the Hudson-Street-Chestnut orthogrnphy,
I have decided not to employ it here. The ideal choice for this hook would
undoubtedly be the practical phonemic orthography I had suggested in I9H2, and
which I used in some early publications (McGregor 1985 and 1986a). This
orthography was based on the well established Walmajarri orthography (sec, for
example, Hudson and Richards 1978:72), to which the two digmphs th and nh
had been added, and the long vowel digraphs ii and uu omitted; it is the same a .-:
the Kija orthography recommended by McConvcll for usc in the Turkey Creek
School. However, I have fell that this orthography is unnecessarily diiTcrcnt
from the native speakers' choice. I have therefore proposed (McGregor 1986h),
for academic purposes only, a phonemic orthography which employs letters and
digraphs which accord more closely 10 Lhc speakers' choices. This system will he
employed throughout this book, except where a narrow phonetic transcription is
necessary, where I will usc IPA symbols. The following lcuers and digraphs are
used:Vowels: a, aa (long a), i. oo (IPA u);
Consonants: b, m (bilabials); d, n, I, dd (apico-alvcolars); rd, rn, rl, r (apicodomals); Jh, nh (lamino-dcntals); j, ny, ly (lamino-palaUlls): g,
ng (dorso-vclars); and w, y (semivowcls).
Cluster restrictions prevent ambiguity between digraphs and consonant
clusters, except in the cases of ng and ly. The cluster /n-g/ occurs within
morphemes, where it contrasts with both the velar nasal/ng/ and the nasal stop28INTRODUCTIONsequence /ng-g/; I follow the Hudson-Street-Chestnut decision to distinguish the
first sequence (i.e. the apical n followed by the dorsa-velar stop g) by placing a
full stop between the n and the g, thus: n.g. The cluster fl-y/ occurs at certain
morpheme boundaries. But because it is entirely predictable morphologically,
and contextually unambiguous, there is no need to distinguish the phoneme /ly/
from the phoneme sequence fl-y/ in writing.
In choosing to use an orthography at odds with the one decided on by native
speakers of the language, I realise that I leave myself open to criticism from the
speakers, as well as certain linguists. However, I assure both groups that I do not
mean to question the speakers' decisions, or their rights to make orthographic
decisions; nor so I suggest that they should use my orthography. There seems to
me to be no reason why the two orthographies cannot coexist, each to be used for
its own purposes - mine in academic linguistic descriptions, the Street-ChestnutHudson orthography in literacy materials. (It goes without saying that in any case
at least two systems of writing the language will be necessary: an adequate
dictionary should at least indicate the phonemic representation of each word and, given the present precarious state of Gooniyandi, perhaps also accurate
information on their pronunciation.) Furthermore, this book being addressed to an
audience of linguists, I can foresee no likelihood of confusion resulting from my
decision. On the other hand, in publications intended principally for use by
Gooniyandi people and/or for use in language programmes in schools, I have
employed the Street-Chestnut-Hudson orthography (see for example McGregor
1988d and in preparation-b).","[38, 39, 40, 41]"
"•----------POSTPOSIDONS187(c) the handedness of a person, as in waroogoo-binyi (left-PER) 'left
handed'; in this use, -binyi would appear to fulfil a stem forming function.
On one occasion only, -binyi PER was followed by the ERG postposition
- on repetition of the example, the ERG was omitted. The example was:
(3-97) balyoowa -binyi -ngga gilbawidi
thinga
behind
PER ERG they:found:him foot
They found his footprints from behind.'
An explanation for this phenomenon remains unclear.3.7.2.9 -ngaddi COMITative-ngaddi COMIT marks:
(a) nominal phrases fulfilling the clausal role of Means - see section
5.2.3.3. (In transitive and reflexive/reciprocal clauses, as we have already seem,
-ngaddi COMIT is followed by -ngga ERG.
(b) nominal phrases in the Accompaniment role, when the accompanying
and the accompanied entities are of unequal status- see section 5.2.3.5.
(c) something in close association with an entity, such as a possession.
The possession may be either alienable (example (4-78)) or inalienable (example
(3-98)).
(3-98) ngaragnga goornboo gamoo -ngaddi
he:made:it woman
breast COMIT
'He painted a woman with breasts.'
As examples (4-78) and (3-98) demonstrate, this sense arises when the
-ngaddi PP fulfils a role in a phrase. It also occurs when the comitative PP
functions as Attribute in a characterising clause - see section 5.2.1.1.1.2.
There is, however, as has already been mentioned, no reason to regard nominals
marked with -ngaddi COMITas derived adjectives (cf. Dixon 1980:324-325).
Finally, there are a few apparently irregular uses of -ngaddi COMIT, in
which this postposition seems to function as a stem forming suffix:
yoowarningaddi (one-COMIT) 'once', ngirndangaddi (this-COMIT) 'this way',
ngirndangaddingga (this-COMIT-ERG) 'this side'. ngooddoongaddingga (thatCOMIT-ERG) 'that side', yinigangaddi (somehow-COMIT) 'by some means, by
what means'. There are also half a dozen or so mother-in-law avoidance
nominals, including bin.gidi-ngaddi (feather-COMIT) 'bird' and wanya-ngaddi
(emu feather-COMIT) 'emu', which are analysable as ordinary nominal plus the188THE WORDcomitative postposition.3.7.2.10 -winyja DEPrivative
The postposition -winyja DEP is quite infrequent in occurrence, and seems to be
used in only one function. That is, to indicate something - always a thing,
never a process - the lack of which causes an event to occur; see section
5.2.3.6 and examples (5-159) and (5-160).
It should be noted that Gooniyandi has no bound morpheme, either suffix
or postposition, that functions as a regular privative marker. Instead, to express
this meaning, the negative particle marlami 'nothing, without' is used following
(usually) the nominal referring to the thing lacked. The contrast between these
two expressions, NP-winyja, and [N mar/ami], is that the former has the
additional semantic component, absent from the latter, that the lack of the thing
is the cause of the process. In keeping with this, only the latter occurs in
relational clauses expressing 'x has no y'.3.7.2.11 -yooddoo - -yiddi DUal and -yarndi PLural
These two postpositions, -yooddoo- -yiddi DU and -yarndi PL, optionally mark
the number of an NP as either dual or plural (three or more) respectively. As yet
it is not clear what factors motivate the occurrence or non-occurrence of these
morphemes on non-singular NPs. (A likely hypothesis is that they are used: (i)
in initial specification of number, and otherwise (ii) to help keep reference clear,
for instance when a text involves two (or more) groups of items which would be
referred to by the same nominal, but which consist of different numbers of these
items. But this hypothesis has not been tested by extensive textual
investigation.) Examples of usage include (4-77), (4-86), (4-95), (4-96), and
lines (5), (21) and (61) of Text 1, and line (6) of Text 2.
3.8 EncliticsUnlike postpositions and stem forming suffixes, enclitics do not form, together
with the units to which they are attached, other grammatical units of the same
rank as those to which they are attached. Therefore, enclitics do not allow for
recursive embedding, such as is possible to a limited extent with postpositions
and stem forming suffixes.
The following are the main enclitics:•
ENCUTICS-moowa
-nyooloo
-ngaddaya
-widdi
-jangi-rni
-mi- -ma
-nyali
-woo189'only' (ON)
'etcetera' (ETC)
'else, too' (TOO)
'identity unknown' (UNKN)
'like' (SEM)
'next, now' (SEQ)
'indefinite, question' (IND)
'repetition, again' (REP)
'definite' (DEF)The glosses given above should not be taken seriously; they are meant to be no
more than suggestive. For a detailed discussion of the meanings of these
morphemes, see section 6.3 below.
The enclitic -jangi SEM is exceptional in that it sometimes forms a g-unit with
the constituent to which it is attached - see for instance, examples (6-95) and
(6-96) below. The fact that it does not ALWAYS form such a unit justifies its
classification as an enclitic. This does, however, necessitate a slight modification
to the definition given in the first paragraph of this section: enclitics are
morphemes which do not necessarily form g-units with the units to which they are
attached. (Postpositions and stem forming suffixes always do.)The enclitics show very little allomorphy - which is partly because none
of the initial consonants are affected by rules discussed in section 2.4. The
indefinite enclitic is the only one showing altemant forms. Its allomorphs -rna
and -mi are chosen depending on the class of the item to which they are attached:
-ma if it is verbal, -mi otherwise.
Two subsets may be distinguished: the first, consisting of the six
morphemes -moowa ON, -nyooloo ETC, -ngaddaya TOO, -widdi UNKN, -jangi
SEM and -rni SEQ from the list above, may be attached to non-verbal units
only, while the remaining three occur with all classes of units, verbal and nonverbal. When attached to non-verbal items, enclitics typically occur in final
position, following all other bound morphemes. But in the VP, -rna IND and
-nyali REP occur medially, in order class (3), labeled Mood in formula F1 on
page 192 below; that is, it follows the first grammatical word of the VP. -Woo
DEF, by contrast, follows the CC word and occurs in position (5), labeled Mode
in Fl. Placement of the enclitics is not arbitrary, but correlates with the 'scope'
and 'focus' of the enclitic (see section 6.3).
Sequences of enclitics do occur, though too infrequently to permit firm
generalisations to be made at this stage; I suspect (but cannot demonstrate) that
their order is meaningful. The only sequence that is at all common is190'IHEWORD-jangi-nyali SEM-REP 'just/exactly like', as in minyawoo-jangi-nyali (cat-SEMREP) 'just like a cat'.
3.9 The verb phrase
In this section I discuss the structure of the 'verb' - that distributional word and
grammatical phmse which realises the clausal role of Process.
3.9.1 Verbals
Verbals have already been def""med as those lexical (open-class) words which are
bound; all other lexical words have the privilege of free occurrence. Verbals have
just two contexts of occurrence: they occur either as constituents of finite VPs,
or as non-finite verbs. Although words of other classes may occur in the first
context, only verballexemes occur in the second. Furthennore, every verbal may
occur within a non-finite 'purposive' clause, in which construction it is followed
by the -woo allomorph of the dative postposition (see page 174 above)- e.g.
ward-goo (go-D AT) 'for going', bayal-woo (swim-DAT) 'for swimming'.
Another distinctive property of verbals is, as we have already seen, that, as a
class, they show phonotactic differences from the words of other lexical classes:
final consonants are permitted and frequent (section 2.2.5); there are statistically
significant differences in distribution of initial consonants in verbals compared
with other classes (section 2.2.5); and there is a high frequency of (closed)
monosyllables (section 2.3.1).
I have been unable to distinguish subclasses within the class of verbals. In
particular, it is not possible to distinguish disjoint classes of transitive and
intransitive verbals (cf. Dixon 1980:378). Whereas in many Australian
languages transitivity may be regarded as a lexical feature of verbs (Dixon
1980:278), in Gooniyandi transitivity has a clausal locus, and a single verbal
lexeme may occur in clauses of more than one transitivity type. Choice of
classifier may go some way towards distinguishing the transitivity of a VP for example, ward-ji (go-PAST/(3sg)N+I) 'he went' vs. ward-nga (goPAST/(3sg)N+A) 'he took it'. However, it proves equally impossible to
distinguish transitivity classes at phrase level as at word level (see sections
5.2.1.3 and 6.5.5 below).
Verbals in Gooniyandi constitute a large open class of lexemes which refer
to all sorts of processes, including: states (e.g. wara- 'stand', bagi- 'lie'); changes
of state (e.g. nang- 'die'); motion, including induced motion (e.g. ward- 'go,
walk, bring'); violent actions (such as gard- 'hit, fell', bananggadd- 'snatch');THE VERB PHRASE191perception and mental processes (e.g. danymili- 'hear, listen'. mila- 'see, look');
communication (for examplejangi- 'answer',jag- 'tell'); and so on.
3.9.2 The non-finite verb
Within non-finite clauses, which are always embedded in some other unit
(section 5.5), there occurs a semantically impoverished verbal construction
which consists of either a bare verbal stem, or of a verbal stem followed by an
infinitive, either -bari (section 5.5.3.1) or -mawoo (section 5.5.3.2). As a
constituent of a clause, the non-finite verbal construction ought to be of phrase
level. However, since the only way in which a verbal root may be expanded is
by the addition of a (verbal) stem forming suffix (see section 3.12.2.1), or by
the addition of an infinitive, there seems to be little independent reason to regard
the construction as a phrase, and as a consequence, I do not make this
assumption. In contrast with the finite VP, the non-finite verb carries very little
information about the process: no reference is made to the participants involved
in it, temporal and modal distinctions are not made, and the semantic type of the
process is not indicated.
When there is no infinitive, the verbal stem, being a bound form, must be
followed by another morpheme, either a postposition or a nominal stem forming
suffix (see 3.12.1.1 below), depending on whether the non-finite clause is
embedded under a PP node or under a word node. (Postpositions and stem
forming suffixes, as distinct from infinitives, are not constituents of the nonfinite verb, as will be shown below, in section 5.5.) Infinitival constructions are
usually found in non-finite clauses attributing on participant roles (section 5.2)
in the finite clauses in which they (the non-finite clauses) are embedded. In the
present data, -ngga ERG is the only postposition that ever follows an infinitive.
(Further fieldwork may uncover other combinations.)
3.9.3 The finite verb phrase
Finite VPs occur in non-embedded ""situation"" type clauses (see section 5.2.1),
in which they realise the role of Process. A finite VP consists of two obligatory
constituents, a lexical 'head' referring to the process, and a classifier complex
(CC), which indicates the person and number of the main participants in the
process (see 5.2.1.3 below), tense, and the type of process it is (in terms of the
features described in section 6.5.5 below). In addition to these two obligatory
constituents there are a number of optional elements carrying aspectual, modal
and other qualification of the process. A schematic representation of the VP isTHE WORD192
given in the following formula:F1 Process-(Aspect)-(Mood)-CC-(Mode)-(Oblique pronominal)-(Number)
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
where brackets enclose optional elements.
As was claimed earlier, this unit is a singled-word of phrasal rank; it is
not an inflectional form of the Process lexeme. Its two obligatory constituents
are g-words. The' remaining, optional constituents are enclitics to these words.
That is, these optional constituents do not form g-words with the obligatory
constituents. There is no evidence, for example, that Process plus Aspect is an
inflectional form of the lexical root filling the role of Process, or that the two
together form a distinct stem. In the absence of such evidence, I make the
weakest assumption, that the aspect markers etc. are constituents of the verb
phrase.
A finite VP may consist of between two and four (perhaps five at the
most) phonological words (as defined in section 2.5.1). The two grammatical
words, the item realising the role of Process, and the CC, are usually distinct
phonological words; but, as mentioned earlier (see pages 128 and 135), the
boundary of the phonological word may move forwards, and so not coincide with
the grammatical boundary. Monosyllabic enclitics are, with one exception,
unstressed and cohere with the preceding phonological word. The exception is
the bound oblique pronominal enclitic -nhi 'to him/her/it', which takes stress.
Enclitic morphemes of two or more syllables are usually phonological words,
and are stressed on their initial syllable. There are just a few exceptions without
initial stress, all of which have an initial {w}, which is affected by VR6: {wila}
FACT (see below 3.9.3.4); the allomorph {wanhi} of the third person singular
oblique pronominal enclitic (see section 3.9.3.6); and the allomorph ( waddi} of
the paucal number enclitic (see section 3.9.3.7).
It appears that (3) (Mood) and (5) (Mode) in Fl are in complementary
distribution; otherwise there are examples displaying choices from all other
combinations of categories. Some examples (written phonemically) are:

"Next to the correlative constructions such as (5-261) and (5-262) there is an
alternative construction, which appears to be roughly synonymous:

B: 'I didn't, that other man took it.'
Probably the most reasonable way of accounting for (5-264) and (5-265) is to
assume that mangaddi thirirli 'not hard' and mangaddi nganyingga 'not by me'
respectively are elliptical clauses. These sentences would be regarded as 'reduced'
correlative constructions of the type exemplified in (5-260) to (5-262) above.
Sometimes mangaddi x (not x) follows the positive clause (instead of preceding
it), in which case it seems to be added as a type of afterthought:
I mangaddi

"N goonyoo is attested in two contexts. (i) It is used when there is a closed
set of possibilities for the particular 'role'. This was the case for example (3-14),
in which the hearer was requested to identify her child from within a group of
children. (ii) The most frequent use of ngoonyoo is, however, as an
indefinite/interrogative for places. In this use, ngoonyoo occurs (normally) as
the only word-level constituent in a 'local' postpositional phrase, realising a
spatial circumstance (see section 5.2.3.1). For example:
(3-15) ngoonyi -yidda2 wardginggiri
which
ALL you:go
'You're going somewhere,' or 'Where are you going?'
(3-16) ngoonyoo -nhingi wardji
which
ABL
he:went
'He came from somewhere.' or 'Where did he come from?'
It is possible that these two senses of ngoonyoo are related as contextualisations
of a single formal meaning. However, at present, it is not clear whether this
involves the notion of place - examples such as (3-14) allow this interpretation
in that the alternatives to be chosen from are as a rule present in the extralinguistic situation, and may be identified by their location. On the other hand, it
may involve just the notion of choice from a constrained set of possibilities in the case of (ii), the set of possibilities is constrained by type: they are all

described as constructions of word-level units; and words consist of morphemes,
and are describable as constructions of morphemic units. For example, the clause
of (3-1) has the constituent structure shown in Figure 3-2.

PhraseWord

(Here, the unanalysed -ari 'he/she/it is' may be regarded as a word
consisting of three morphemes, present tense, third person singular nominative,
and the classifier +I, although it is not possible in this case to uniquely segment
the form- see section 3.9.3.2.4 below.)
The intermediate ranks of phrase and word have been introduced in order to
account for the possibility of branching: in Figure 3-2, in each case in which a131PREUMINARY REMARKSnode is marked (except for the terminal nodes), there is either a branch, or
branching is possible at that point. That is, the function that this constituent
has is realised, or could be realised by a unit with internal structure. (Other
changes - e.g. to the person/number ""agreement"" in the verbal complex may be necessary to preserve grammaticality.) For example, the word waba'smell' in (3-1) realises the function of Process in the phrase of which it is a
constituent, and this may be realised by bimorphemic constructions such as
gard-bi- (hit-IT) 'belt'.
There are, however, certain linguistic units that cannot be placed on the
rank scale. This includes a number of words which may occur directly as
constituents of clauses, and a number of morphemes which occur as phrasal
constituents, without intervening phrase and word nodes respectively. This holds
true for the word mangaddi 'not' in example (3-3), and the morphemes -yooddoo
DU and -jidda ALL in (3-2), and -ngga ERG in (3-3), as is shown in the
constituent analyses of figures 3-3 and 3-4.

mangaddi niyi -ngga dij- -jingi
-Yooddoo DU and -jidda ALL in Figure 3-2, and -ngga ERG in Figures 3-3
and 3-4, have bypassed the word level, while mangaddi 'not' in Figure 3-3 has
bypassed both phrase and word levels. This is because in these instances there is
no possibility of branching between the morpheme level and the next one up:
these morphemes do not enter into syntagms with other morphemes, to form
grammatical words. Because of this, I do not refer to forms such as mangaddi
'not', even though they are free forms, as grammatical words (see also below
section 3.1.2).
We have now identified two types of unit: ranking and non-ranking. It
turns out that, in Gooniyandi, all form items (Matthews 1981:59) are nonranking, and conversely, the majority of non-ranking units are form items. The
only exceptions are the adverbials, which are non-ranking units (section 3.2),
but are not form items. With the exception of adverbials, all non-ranking units
are form items, and must occur in construction with ranking units. The resulting
syntagm is typically a unit of the same rank as the ranking unit (as is the case
in the preceding two examples above) - although sometimes it does not
constitute a unit at all (see below section 3.8).
One further qualification is necessary: certain clauses may consist only of a
single morpheme, usually an interjection - e.g. yoowayi 'yes' (see below
3.10). Evidently these are ""minor"" clauses, and might reasonably be placed off
the rank scale: they never have internal structure. In this case ""clause"" and
""morpheme"" coincide.
There are two main ways in which trees can become more complicated.
Firstly, as Figures 3-3 and 3-4 show, embedding is possible. In these particular
examples the embedded unit is of the same rank as the unit it is embedded in.
However, rankshifting (Huddleston 1965:45) - which is a special type ofPRELIMINARY REMARKS133embedding in which the unit embedded is of higher rank than the unit in which
it is embedded - is also possible, albeit rare and of limited productivity in
Gooniyandi (see below 4.1.2.1 and 5.5). The maximum depth of embedding
attested in my corpus is three, as in the following configuration:
PPA pNPA (N)ppA
NP1P1Here NP 1 cannot have another phrase embedded within it (see section 4.2).
Furthermore, when the embedding also involves rankshifting, the maximum
depth appears to be one: if a unit of higher rank is embedded under a unit of
lower rank, then no unit can be embedded within the embedded unit
The second complication is that units (typically of the same rank) may
form syntagms that are not units of the next highest rank. For instance,
(3-4) garndiwiddi yoowooloo yoowarni goornboo
two
man
one
woman
'two men and one woman'consists of two phrases, [garndiwiddi yoowooloo] 'two men' and [yoowarni
goornboo] 'one woman', each of which has the characteristic structure of an NP.
The structure of the whole is clearly not that of an NP - it cannot be described
in terms of the functions identified for the NP (see section 4.1.2.1), although its
two constituents can be. Neither is it a clause. Constructions such as these will
be referred to as complexes, following Huddleston (1965). There are, in
Gooniyandi, word complexes, phrase complexes and clause complexes; in
addition, certain complexes of words and phrases occur. (It is also possible that
there are morpheme complexes.)3.1.2Types of wordIt is necessary to distinguish four different types of word in Gooniyandi. Firstly
there is the phonological word, which is as described in the previous chapter. A
second type of word is the grammatical word- abbreviated g-word- which is
a grammatical unit of word rank; that is, it is the smallest unit that can have
constituency structure. This unit was introduced in the previous subsection.","[115, 116, 117, 118]"
"Disjunction may be expressed through the use of the indefinite enclitic, as
in example (4-93) above. Two forms, -wamiri and -wami, evidently built on
-mi, are sometimes found in the expression of disjunction. (They are, however,
never used as markers of doubt alone.) Example:
(6-109) wamba barngooddiniyaningi -wamiri
later
they:are:retuming today
DISJ
moongaya -wami
tomorrow DISJ
'They'll be returning later, today or tomorrow.'",[470]
"This clause asserts that ngaddagi thangarndi 'my language' and Gooniyandi are
identical, that the phrases are coreferential, and provide alternative designations
of a single entity.
In this example, Gooniyandi identifies the speaker's language: knowing
that I was learning the language, he identified his own language by a designation
he could safely assume I would know the referent of. Clearly he was not (in this
situation) using the clause to identify the language Gooniyandi as the one he
spoke - since he could not have expected me to know what his language was.",[278]
"The expected forms nganyi-yidda (I-ALL) and nganyi-yoo (1-DAT) do not occur.
However, this is the only context in which the oblique form may realise the
Entity function. If there is an intervening morpheme, such as a number marking
postposition, the nominative form occurs:
(3-77) ngidi-yooddoo -yoo gamba
we(R) DU
DAT water
'He'll show it to us two.'binabinawangiddangiyi
he:will:show:it:to:us:twoFinally, the oblique form is found in what would appear to be a type of
circumstance, indicating that the Actor did the process alone, or by him/herself.
The clause may be transitive, intransitive, or reflexive/reciprocal.
(3-78) ngaddagi -moowa ngoorloogla

'They pulled themselves up by themselves.'
If the pronominals in (3-78) and (3-80) were NP constituents it would beexpected that they might occur in construction with postpositions, indicating
their role in the clause. However, they never do (in the available examples), and
moreover they contrast with PPs such as yoowarni-ngga (one-ERG) 'by one' in
(3-81). Contrast this with (3-78) above.
(3-81) yoowarni -ngga ngoorloogla
one
ERG I:drank:it
'I drank it alone.'
In this respect the oblique forms resemble adverbials, and an alternative
(perhaps equally valid) parts-of-speech classification might place the nominative
pronominals in the class on nominals, and the oblique and emphatic
pronominals in the adverbial class.
The forms I have labeled emphatic are used very similarly to the 'adverbial'
function of the oblique just discussed, but seem to be somewhat stronger,
indicating that not only did the Actor act alone, or as a unified group, but
he/she/they did so for his/her/their own benefit:

3.7 Postpositions
3.7.1 Preliminary remarks
The postpositions form a small class of non-ranking form units which enter into
constituency with noun phrases, forming postpositional phrases. They are
bound, phrase-level morphemes which typically occur one per phrase, and
attached to any word in the phrase, regardless of its position or role (see section
4.2 below).
Gooniyandi has fourteen postpositions. These may be divided initially into
two groups, as shown below:TIIEWORD174Number markingCase marking

PL(ural)This classification is primarily semantic, although there is at least one
formal correlate: the number markers appear to be distributionally restricted to
nominals, whilst the case markers may also occur on adverbials (see page 140
above). The two members of the second column indicate a property of the
nominal phrase to which they are attached, namely its number- and hence their
label ""number marking"" postpositions. The postpositions in the first column,
on the other hand, do not indicate any property of quality of the referent of the
nominal phrase to which they are attached. Rather, they relate that referent to
something else. I have labeled these as ""case marking"" postpositions because
they express a range of functions that are covered by case-suffixes in many
Australian languages (we will.be returning to this point shortly, and later again
in section 42).
Most Australian languages have a set of suffixes comparable with those
laid out above for Gooniyandi (see Dixon 1980:293-301, 322-326). Most
grammars, however, classify the suffixes quite differently. It is customary to
distinguish between case suffixes and derivational suffixes. The former are
inflectional, and give rise to different forms of a single word appropriate to
different syntactic environments, while the latter are non-inflectional, and
produce new lexemes from other lexical items to which they are attached (Dixon
1980:293, 323; see also Huddleston 1984:25). In section 4.2 it is shown that
none of the morphemes listed above are inflections; it can also be demonstrated
that none are derivational suffixes.
Grammars of Australian languages usually treat the comitative, and the
number markers as derivational suffixes (Dixon 1980:324-325). It is easy toPOSTPOSIDONS175show that the number markers are not derivational: they indicate the number of
the whole phrase, not the word to which they are attached (see page 278 below).
The comitative postposition is not a derivational morpheme, since it regularly
attaches to a full NP (as in example (4-80)), and there is no evidence that the
constituent that it attaches to becomes a new lexical item. These same reasons,
show that none of the remaining postpositions are derivational suffixes.
The comitative, though not the dual and plural markers, do, it is true,
occasionally have derivational uses. But this occasional use stands in contrast
with the productive uses of this morpheme as a case marking postposition (see
section 3.7.2.9 below). It might also be noted on the one hand that the
morphemes which I have classified as stem forming suffixes ALWAYS
functional derivationally, and on the other, that -nhingi ABLlt as well as
possibly -ngga ERG and -binyi PER also on occasions form new lexical items
from the one to which they are attached.
I refer to the morphemes in the left hand column above as case marking
postpositions because they fulfil functions which are associated with case
inflections in many languages, including many Australian languages - they
indicate the function of the phrase in the unit of which it is a constituent (cf.
Dixon 1980:292). However, this should not obscure the important difference
that in Gooniyandi the case markers do not form inflectional variants of a
lexeme (see section 4.2 for further discussion of this issue).
One important consequence of this difference is that, unlike most
Australianist grammarians, I do not identify a zero-marked absolutive case,
which contrasts with the ergative. There are a number of reasons for this
descriptive strategy. Firstly, it would imply a postposition which had an
invariant zero form. Whilst it is possible to maintain such a notion, there is
simply no evidence in the language which lends support to it. (To argue this
would be tantamount to arguing that subject NPs in English were in fact
prepositional phrases with a zero preposition.) Indeed, what evidence there is
leads us to reject the idea: to maintain that there were a zero postposition would
imply that the zero marked unit were an exocentric construction; this is in fact
false. Secondly, zero marking does not signal anything in itself, but the absence
of other meanings. Thirdly, no significant semantic or syntactic generalisation
arises under the zero postposition hypothesis.
All but four of these postpositions show phonologically conditioned
allomorphic alternations, as follows:
(i) -ngga ERG. This postposition is affected by two sandhi rules. One is rule
R9, by which -ngga dissimilates to-ga following a vowel that is preceded by a1761HEWORDnasal-stop sequence (see examples on page 98 above). The other is rule R9,
which inserts an epenthetic /i/ when the root ends with the velar nasal. For
example, gooddanggooddang-ingga (diverbird-ERG) 'by the diverbird'.
(ii) {y} initial postpositions. Nine of the postpositions have an initial f y}. Inaccordance with rule R6 of section 2.4.2.3.1, this initial segment hardens to /j/
following non-continuant consonants. Few Gooniyandi nominals end in
consonants, and in most cases the form of the postposition with initial /j/ is
attested only when the nominal is a borrowing from English, or when the
postposition is attached to a verbal root with a final stop or nasal (see below).
Examples illustrating the hardening process are: Jag-joo (Jack-OAT) 'for Jack',
babligaj-jaljanggal-jiddal-jayil-jayoo!-jawoo (pub-LOC/ABJ..dALLtfALLjALL:J
ALL4) 'at/from/to the pub', goorij-jangga (hold-AB~ 'from holding', and Dayibjooddoot-jarndi (Dave-DU/PL) 'a pair/group including Dave'.
(iii) -woo DAT. The verb specific allomorph -woo of the dative postposition issubject to VR6, the effect of which is to harden the initial ( w} to /g/ when
following a non-continuant, as for instance in gaj-goo (cut-DAT) 'for cutting'
and ngarag-goo (make-DAT) 'for making'.
The -yooddoo- -yiddi allomorphy is not phonologically conditioned. The
choice seems to be a matter of speaker's preference: some speakers use the
former, while others prefer the latter. (Today at least, the two forms do not
appear to be dialectal variants associated with distinct regions.)
In addition to occurring in constituency with NPs, some postpositions also
occur in constituency with PPs, adverbials and/or non-finite clauses. The first
possibility gives rise to sequences of postpositions, since the postpositions
from each PP are typically attached to the same d-word. Only a small subset of
the sequences that COULD occur actually DO occur. The first member of any
postposition sequence must be one of -nhingi ABLI> -ngaddi COMIT, -binyi
PER, -yooddoo DU, or -yarndi PL. Of these, the number markers -yooddoo DU
and -yarndi PL can be follow~ by any other postposition (note also that they are
always flrst in a postposition sequence). The remaining three, the case markers,
may be followed by the ergative -ngga only.
Postposition sequences may also arise when a PP is embedded as a constituent of
an NP which is itself embedded in a PP. No new sequences arise in this way.","[157, 158, 159, 160, 161]"

As (5-365) and (5-366) illustrate, the situations referred to may well be
related temporally either as successive or as simultaneous respectively. In the
former instance, clause order (among clauses related by addition) almost always
reflects temporal order of the referent situations. Otherwise the most important
situation is mentioned frrst It would seem reasonable to suppose that the second

There is, furthermore, no connecting morpheme with· the adversative or
'contrary to expectation' sense. This relation either goes unmarked (example
(5-369)), or is occasionally indicated by the particle moorda 'certainly' (as in

Additively connected clauses are juxtaposed to one another, and each is as a
rule continuous. In particular, nominal phrases are usually contiguous with the
VP of their own clause. As a rule, if there are shared participants, they are
referred to in the initial clause, and ellipsed in the subsequent one(s).

"CLAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS489This construction, in which the negated quality is followed by a positive term of
the same sense, seems to indicate an intensification of the quality or quantity,
much as English 'very' (which has no counterpart in Gooniyandi).
It might be suggested that mangaddi x can be accounted for as an elliptical clause,
as was suggested above (section 5.4.1) for similar examples with non-scalars.
Against this hypothesis is the fact that in this use mangaddi x is invariably
followed by the corresponding positive, and the two would appear to form a type
of correlative construction. Contrast example (5-255), where the correlation would
seem to be with the preceding clause.","[472, 473]"
"GOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIETY9Material culture was relatively simple. Men used a variety of different types of
spears and boomerangs for hunting and fighting; women used digging sticks for
gathering yams, stone axes for chopping honey from hollows in trees, and
coolamons (a type of dish) for carrying water, seeds, berries, babies and so on. In
addition, the tool kit included fire drills, fire saws and grinding stones.
Permanent dwellings were not made, but rough shelters were constructed from
spinifex and branches for occasional protection from the elements.
The Gooniyandi had an intimate and detailed knowledge of their
environment, including its geography; the distribution of plant species and their
uses; and the seasons, and ripening times of various plant species. For instance,
some plants, and parts of plants, were known to have medicinal properties;
others were used as poisons (for example, one type of sap was used in small
waterholes to poison fish). The men in particular were excellent trackers, who
could identify animal species, and individual human beings by their tracks, an
ability which was of course crucial to their success as hunters (and later to the
success of white occupation- see McGregor 1988b).
Although most everyday social interaction of the Gooniyandi would have
been within their group (or ""tribe""), there was also significant and important
interaction with other nearby groups, principally the Bunuba, Kija, Walmajarri,
and Nyikina peoples. This is evidenced by the high degree of multilingualism
among the older Gooniyandi; and quite likely inter-tribal marriages were not
uncommon. There is also, on Gooniyandi territory, an important waterho1e,
Jiliyardi, where inter-tribal ceremonies and corroborees were once held.
Furthermore, the Gooniyandi participated in - and still participate in, perhaps
to an even greater extent today, thanks to modern vehicles- an extensive
network of trade and exchange (Akerman 1979, Kolig 1981:126-127), which
they call wirnandi (wurnan in most other nearby languages). This took place in
two main streams of exchange. In a direct line through the major Aboriginal
communities of the southern Kimberley region, and in a westerly direction,
move myths, rituals, and body designs associated with the ""Woagaia"" (Kolig
1981:126) tradition. From the west Kimberley and Dampier Land, moving in
the opposite direction, come mainly material items, including large quantities of
shells (especially the highly coveted pearl shell) and shields. Thus many of the
songs and sacred myth cycles associated with important initiation ceremonies
presently ""owned"" by the Gooniyandi originated in the east, a fact which they
readily acknowledge. Many others have, within living memory, been passed on
to the west in exchange for goods.
Writing was unknown in Aboriginal Australia. Inscribed message sticks10lNTRODUCTIONwere used by the Gooniyandi to convey important information concerning
ceremonies and so on, but these attested more to the validity of the messenger
and his message than represented any particular text. Sand drawings are
occasionally used to illustrate spoken texts, but the system is not as well
developed, nor used as extensively as in the Centre (cf. Munn 1973). Various
hand signs were employed; these usually involved particular hand shapes,
together with movement. However, it seems that the repertoire of signs was
small by comparison with the desert peoples'. There were signs for common
animals, birds, and reptiles (at least those which were eaten), some basic actions,
affirmation and negation, and questions. Hand signs were presumably used when
verbal communication was not appropriate (e.g. in hunting), or suitable (e.g.
over a great distance). Hand signs are rarely used as adjuncts to spoken texts, and
there is no evidence that there was a well developed sign language such as is
found in Warlpiri (see Kendon 1978). Direction and location could be indicated
non-verbally by lip pointing, which may be concomitant with speech, giving
rise to phonetically lip-rounded vowels and consonants.
The Gooniyandi traditionally practised various forms of bodily operations
on young males as rites of passage into manhood. These included circumcision
around puberty, and a few years later on, subincision; even later, horizontal
cicatrices were made across the chest, and a hole was made through the nasal
septum. Only the oldest living Gooniyandi men have undergone all of these riles
of passage; the majority of young adult and middle aged males have been
circumcised only, although some middle aged men do also have a few cicatrices.
The operations of circumcision and subincision were accompanied by a series of
preparatory and follow-up stages and ceremonies. Prior to the operation of
circumcision, the novice was taken on a trip to visit various relevant groups to
formally invite them to the ceremony. The operation itself took place during a
corroboree involving both men and women; today the main circumcision
corroboree is the Waloongaddi (Walungarri in Walmajarri orthography).
Following their circumcision, the initiands were secluded in the bush for some
months during which time they were permitted to engage in limited contact only
with one another and the older men - usually a mother's brother- who looked
after them. During this time, they also received ritual instruction; this was
followed up later with further instruction, as the man went through later stages
of initiation.
There is an extensive mythology relating to events from a time in the
distant past referred to in Gooniyandi and nearby languages by the term
ngaddanggarni (ngarrangkarni in Walmajarri and Kija orthographies), and in theGOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIEIY11anthropological literature by the term ""dreamtime"". Aborigines in the region
also refer to this period as the dreamtime, although there seems to be no direct
connection with dreams. The myths explain the origin and names of
geographical formations, origins of animal species and social practices,
geographical location and land tenure of language groups, and so on. For
instance, Text 2 (see Appendix 1) is a myth about fire, which apparently
explains its social value, and also, perhaps, its usefulness (cf. Hodge and
McGregor forthcoming).
Most Gooniyandi myths have a strong orientation to place. They typically
relate the travels of mythical beings over the countryside, from place to place,
and various events that happened along the way at these places, including, for
instance, ceremonies, conflicts with other mythical beings, and putting names to
the significant places. The more important myths - which are usually also
associated with important ceremonies, particularly initiation - refer to paths
which extend right across Gooniyandi country, and into neighbouring territories.
For instance, one very important kangaroo myth begins in the Napier Ranges,
and extends through Bunuba, Gooniyandi and Walmajarri countries, thence into
(and possibly through) Wangkajunga territory. Particular individuals have
ownership rights to parts of the macro-myth, namely the parts which intersect
their own land; and they usually know the outlines of the larger travels, but will
not relate them since they lack the rights to do so. Some myths (see e.g. Text
2), however, lack this place orientation; these are invariably of lesser
importance, and are never associated with significant ceremonial activities.
Songs are both sacred and secular. They are sung to the accompaniment of
clapsticks; although the didgeridoo was known, it was not used in song. As
noted above, many songs originated in the east: this includes both sacred songs
associated with initiation ceremonies, and secular songs such as love songs (cf.
Akerman 1979:249). These usually (though not always) retain the language in
which they originated. For instance, the Gooniyandi repertoire includes love
songs in Gurindji, and songs from the Waloongaddi (Walungarri) cycle in
Wunambal. But there are also songs in the Gooniyandi language, including
traditional sacred songs associated with Gooniyandi mythology and land, and
secular songs invented- rather, dreamed- by Gooniyandi speakers.
As in other Australian Aboriginal groups, the Gooniyandi observed a taboo
on uttering the name of a recently dead person (Nash and Simpson 1981, Dixon
1980:28-29). This taboo extended to lexemes of a similar phonological shape,
and today, to varying extents, to a person's gardiya (white person) name also.
Reference to a recently dead person would usually be indirect - see, for12INTRODUCTIONinstance, line (42) of Text 1. Whenever I revisit my Gooniyandi friends at
Fitzroy Crossing, one of the first things I am invariably told is who has died
since my last visit; this is presumably done in order to avoid the potentially
embarrassing situation of my mentioning that person's name. Reference is
usually made by uttering the person's gardiya name in a low whispering voice.
The taboo on the name of the dead person might last for a number of years (cf.
Dixon 1980:28), depending on the closeness of the relationship between the
speaker and the deceased: close relatives would observe the taboo for a much
longer period than others. Close relatives of the dead would observe, in addition
to the name taboo, a meat taboo, which could last for a considerable time, and
could only be broken by the enactment of a neutralising rite (cf. Hudson and
Richards 1978:44-45).
There was a complex series of funerary rites according to which the bodies
of adults, both men and women, were disposed of (see McGregor forthcoming-a
for further details). The first stage involved putting the dead body on a platform
in a tree. Below the body were placed a number of rocks, each representing a
person potentially responsible for the death. The body would be left on the
platform for some months until it had begun to decompose, at which time an
inquest would be held. The rocks under the platform would be examined, and the
person responsible for the death identified: the rock representing that person
would be marked with the dripping exuviae of the dead body. Once the murderer
had been determined, the death could be avenged, either by sorcery or by a
specially set up avenging party. If no rock had been marked, the process might
be repeated; if (as in one case I was informed of) a number of repetitions still
failed to point to the murderer, it might be decided that no one was responsible,
and no avenging action taken. After the body had fully decomposed, and bones
only remained, it was usually finally disposed of either by burial, or by
placement in a small cave. Today, white institutions have control of the rites,
and the dead are given a Christian burial.","[21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"
"Infinitives1-- - .
Verbal encliticsClassifierr-PronominalsComplex
""Para-linguistic""Interjections
Sound effectsThe parts-of-speech are classified in the table according to four major
contrasts: (a) free vs. bound; (b) non-verbal vs. verbal; (c) linguistic vs. para-PARTS-OF-SPEECH139linguistic; and (d) open vs. closed classes. These oppositions are obviously
insufficient to distinguish the classes from one another. They do, however,
provide a useful framework for the discussion of the parts-of-speech and their
interrelations. Individual lexemes are relatively easily assigned values with
respect to these four oppositions - that is, it is relatively easy to assign them
to one of the six major divisions of the table. However, determining their class
from among the possibilities within a single box is not always so easy (except
in the case of verbal items).
Gooniyandi shows a fundamental distinction between units of the verbal
class versus units of all other classes, at each rank - morpheme, word, phrase,
and perhaps also clause (see section 5.2.1 where situation and relational clauses
are distinguished- situation clauses may be regarded as ""verbal""). Verbal units
(of rank below the clause) are more restricted in distribution than are non-verbal
units, and occur only as constituents of finite verb phrases (VPs), or within nonfinite (embedded) clauses (see section 5.5 below). As has already been
mentioned, non-verbal words and morphemes are less restricted in distribution,
and need not occur in phrases of the same class. As Table 3-1 shows, no verbal
lexical words have the property of independent occurrence; this distinguishes
them from other open class Iexemes. (If an open class lexeme is bound, it must
be a verbal.)
Similarly, closed verbal classes are readily distinguished from other closed
classes by the fact that they are restricted to occurring in VPs, and from one
another by virtue of their position within the VP (see below, 3.9.3.2). The
verbal stem-forming suffixes form a small set of morphemes which, when
suffixed to verbal lexical roots form new verbal stems, which are also g-words.
By contrast, the verbal enclitics do not form g-units with the forms to which
they are attached. They can be subclassified according as to their position in the
VP (see section 3.9.3). As the term suggests, the classifier complex (CC) can be
analysed into constituent morphemes (as per section 3.9.3.2). However, it is a
g-word, and it might reasonably be regarded as an inflectional form of the
classifier. For this reason, the constituent morphemes (which occur nowhere
else) have not been individually classified.
Non-verbal lexical items are either free or bound, and this opposition
agrees fairly well with the distinction between open and closed classes. (The
latter correlates better with the distinction between ranking and non-ranking
units- see section 3.1.1.) The three classes of bound non-verbal morphemes
are distinguished from one another by the nature of the unit they form with the
constituent to which they are attached, specifically, whether it is: a g-word, inTHE WORD140which case the morpheme is a stem forming suffix; a g-phrase, in which case
the morpheme is a postposition; or not a g-unit at all, in which case the
morpheme is an enclitic. The term ""enclitic"" is used throughout this book when
making reference to bound morphemes which do not form grammatical units
with the forms to which they are attached: they retain their grammatical
independence though they do not have distributional independence. The term
""suffix"" is reserved for those morphemes which form g-words with the forms to
which they are attached.
The two classes, nominals and adverbials are not readily distinguished on
morphological grounds. Most bound morphemes that can be attached to open
class nominals can also be attached to lexemes that we would like to classify as
adverbials. The only exceptions I am aware of are the two number marking
postpositions, -yooddoo 'dual' and -yarndi 'plural', which appear to be
distributionally restricted to nominals. Occurrence, or lack of occurrence with
these two morphemes would not, however, seem to be a useful property on
which to base the definition of a lexical class. But it does appear that this
property correlates with more significant syntagmatic properties. In realising
clausal functions, nominals must occur in NPs or PPs. Although adverbials
may occur in NPs and PPs, when realising clausal roles, they typically do not,
and for every adverbial there is some clausal role that it may realise alone. Thus,
adverbials contrast with PPs in realising circumstantial roles. For adverbials
such roles are not normally mediated through postpositions, as is necessarily the
case for nominal units. The two classes, nominals and adverbials, can thus be
distinguished by the ability or non-ability of their members to realise
circumstantial roles. It follows that adverbials are non-ranking units.
It would appear that the three lexical classes can be ranged from most
marked distributionally to least marked thus: verbal, nominal, adverbial. The
following generalisation may now be made. Words of the less marked classes
may occur as constituents of phrases of the more marked classes, but words of
the more marked classes do not have this privilege with respect to the less
marked phrasal classes (assuming that markedness corresponds in a natural way
between the word and the phrase classes). Loosely, nominals can ""function as""
verbals, and adverbials can ""function as"" verbals or nominals; but these are the
only possibilities. Open class lexical words can therefore be defined in terms of
their function in the unit next above on the rank scale, as follows:
VERBALS are those lexemes which must realise the function of Process ina VP;
NOMINALS are those which must either realise a function in an NP, or••NOMINAI.S141(less frequently) the Process in a VP; and
ADVERBIALS are those lexemes which may realise functions in clauses,
NPs, PPs or VPs.
It is convenient to identify a distinct lexical class of pronominals, eventhough the members usually occur in NPs. There are three main reasons for this:
(a) distinct forms of pronominals occur for singular vs. non-singular number
(nominals do not inflect for number); (b) for each pronominal category there are
at least three distinct phonological shapes, which may be regarded as alternate
forms of the one pronominallexeme (depending on the context of occurrence);
and (c) the distribution of pronominals differ significantly from the distribution
of nominals and other parts-of-speech - for instance, pronominals never occur
as Processes in VPs. Recognition of the pronominals as a distinct class
necessitates some fairly obvious and minor adjustments in the definitions of
nominals and adverbials.
Particles constitute a small closed class of free ""form"" words which enter
into syntagms with full clauses, modifying their propositional content.
Two classes have been set off from the others as paralinguistic. (Further
research may well uncover more classes of this type.) Paralinguistic words often
stand as utterances by themselves, constituting ""minor"" clauses: that is, clauses
that can have one constituent only (cf. section 5.4.2 below). As has been
mentioned already (section 2.1.1), many of these words are phonologicallysome even phonetically - irregular.
3.3NominalsThis class contains those words which usually occur as constituents of nominal
phrases- although they are sometimes found elsewhere (e.g. as the lexical
'head' of the finite VP), and words of other classes are frequently found within
nominal phrases. In the previous section I suggested that nominals may be
characterised by the fact that they may occur in either of these two contexts:
always as NP constituents, and potentially as lexical 'heads' of VPs. The class
so defined is open, and has a very large number of members.
There seem to be no compelling reasons to identify distinct subclasses of
adjectives and nouns. Certainly no such subclass can be distinguished on
morphological grounds, such as the ability to combine with a distinct set of
morphemes, or their occurrence with a distinct set of allomorphs of the nominal
morphemes. Furthermore, the classes of words which may realise the NP roles
of Classifier, Entity, or Qualifier (as defined in section 4.1.2.1 below) have142THE WORDmany members in common. Nearly all words which can realise the Entity role
- excepting non-nominals such as pronouns - can also realise the role
Qualifier (and may also be the lexical 'head' of a VP): in other words, words
which can be referential can also be qualifying, and may indicate qualities or
properties of things.
There are, however, a number of words which realise either of the roles,
Classifier or Qualifier, but which have not yet been encountered in the Entity
role. Examples include at least twenty words which, from the English speaker's
point of view, would be good candidates for an adjective class. They include:
colours: gooroogooroo 'black', widdgali 'blue, green', lawagimana 'white';
mental attributes: ganybili 'ashamed', yoowa 'frightened, careful', binaddi
'knowledgeable',jagarndi 'awake', nurna 'greedy';
physical qualities: gawirla 'cold', gijali 'dead', balyadi 'flat', binyidi 'hard',
jaddarndi 'sharp', damarda 'blunt', giddabingaddi 'long', yanoonggoo 'new',
thoowoorndoo 'rotten';
value judgements: joornanygadda 'good', marooloo 'valuable'.
One reason why I hesitate to set these words off as a distinct class is
because semantically similar words do occur in the Entity role, as well as in the
Classifier and Qualifier roles, and so would not be adjectives by the above
criterion. Examples include: thiwa 'red, white person (i.e. person of European
descent)'; boordbara 'hot, heat'; nyamani 'big, boss'; thigi 'short, a bit'; mooyoo
'asleep, sleep'; and thithi 'moving, motion'. It seems to me that the differences
of meaning associated with the different functions are predictable - in each of
the above the first gloss is for the word as a Qualifier or Classifier, the second,
for the word as an Entity, sometimes as a Classifier. Consequently each of the
above forms is a single word, not a pair of homophones. Furthermore, the fact
that the score or so of words listed above have not been encountered in the
Entity function appears to be semantically motivated, and given the appropriate
situation, I would expect that they could be used referentially. For example,
given that boordbara 'hot' is attested in the role of Entity in a nominal phrase
functioning as the Agent of a clause, one would expect that gawirla 'cold' could
also function as the Entity in a nominal phrase in the Gooniyandi version of
'This cold is making me stifr. At this stage of the investigation, it seems to
me, it would be premature to set these words off as a distinct subclass. To do so
would be to take the actually observed 'distribution' too seriously, to ignore the
limitations of the data, and ultimately to deny an aspect of creativity in
language.","[123, 124, 125, 126, 127]"

(Note that, as remarked above, both mangaddi 'not', and mar/ami 'nothing,
without' may be used in replying to positive clauses, indicating the falsity of the
proposition asserted. Only mar/ami 'nothing, without' appears to occur in
response to negative polarity clauses, indicating the falsity of the embedded

Mar/ami 'nothing, without' appears to be used in exact.ly the same way as

positive (example (6-141), or negative (example (6-142).

"I distinguish these clauses initially on intuitive-functional grounds. What
they do is establish associations between non-linguistic referent entities and their
linguistic designations. They do not establish associations between alternative
designations for an object, as do intensive identifying clauses, in which both
NPs are (presumed) cognitively significant to the hearer, and so capable of being
understood to refer to something. In other words, the second NP in naming
Identifying clauses, the name, is used as a representative of itself; it has no
""mental referentn (Fawcett 1980:90). However, there is evidence that they are
grammatically distinct in Gooniyandi. The evidence comes from two main
sources. Firstly, the order of the phrases appears to be fixed; the clauses are
always encoding. Secondly, alone among identifying clauses naming clauses
have situation clause agnates, in which there is an inherent Identifier and an
inherent Identified. This agnate clause involves the verballexeme goowaj- 'call
(by) name':

identify the speaker as the individual whose name is mentioned.",[282]
"418THE ClAUSEnot known whether such shifts normally occur.)
Another respect in which indirect quotes differ from direct quotes is that the
former are never discontinuous; constituents of the indirect quote always occur
on the one side of the projecting clause (cf. page 413 above).
I have already mentioned that reported speech is more frequently represented
by direct quotation than by indirect quotation. But there are certain circumstances
in which indirect quotation is the preferred (perhaps even obligatory) mode of
expression. The main circumstances are the following:
(a) Where there is a conflict between the pronominal categories of the
reported speech situation and the present one such that an interlocutor of the
latter is a third person in the former, indirect quotation tends to be used. That is,
there is a tendency for the speaker to refer to himself and his addressee by a
'personal' - i.e. first or second person form - in preference to a third person
pronominal and/or by name. For example,
(5-350) migawinmi balanginbidi gilbanginyji mooyoo
they:told:me they:sent:me I:found:you sleep
baginggi
you: slept
'They told me that I would find you asleep.'
(On the other hand, non-interlocutors in the present speech situation are freely
referred to by first and second person pronominals in direct quotes.)
(b) Indirect speech frequently occurs where the projected clause takes the
form of a request for information, which the present speaker wishes to be
communicated to himself or herself. That is, the information that the present
speaker requests is information requested by, or communicated to someone else,
who is the (present) addressee, in the examples available. Examples are (5-347)
ax!
(5-351) ngooddoo -ngga yoowooloo yinigami
-nganggi
that
ERG man
he:did:something to:you
ngoonyi -yidtltl wardgiri
where
ALL he:goes
Where did that man tell you he's going?'
Although there is a direct quote corresponding to (5-347) which presumably
differs in the respect that the present speaker is not, directly at least, requesting
the information that will be conveyed to the hearer, there is no corresponding
direct quote for (5-351). The reported speech in this case cannot be representedCLAUSE COMPLEXES419from the viewpoint of the speech situation referred to. (5-348) is a special case,
in which, however, the speaker and the hearer are still the interlocutors and a
different 'turn' of the conversation is being referred to, in which their roles are
reversed. Again, there is no corresponding direct quote for (5-348).
(c) Where the projecting clause is a 'command' which the present speaker
wishes relayed to someone, usually with the addressee acting as an intennediary,
indirect quotation predominates over direct quotation. Examples are:
(5-352) lanis -ngga migami -ngadda nginyji -ga
[name] ERG he:said to:me you
ERG
migami -nhi
Martin -joo niyi -ngga doowyawina

(5-353) jagma
-nhi
wardjawi niyaji balawa
you:will:tell to:him he:will:go this
you:will:send:him
'Tell him to go; send him away.'
As for (b), the utterance does not just report on, and refer to another utterance in which case direct quotation is the norm. Rather, the (linguistic and nonlinguistic) response to the second utterance is of concern to the present speaker,
who is the ultimate source of the command, or of the request for information.
(d) The avoidance style lexeme gamalg- 'say, tell' projects both direct and
indirect quotes. Direct quotation typically occurs when the individual to be
avoided is a participant in the speech situation referred to, whilst indirect
quotation typically occurs when the avoidance-category kinsman is an
interlocutor in the present speech act. By making use of indirect speech in this
circumstance, the utterance reported on is presented from the present perspective,
and so is lexicalised with avoidance-style items. This is as might be expected,
granted that more circumspection is necessary in face-to-face contact with an
avoidance-kinsmen than in reference him/her (cf. section 1.5). For example,
(5-354) gamalgma
-nhi
giddbiwi
-ngadda yilgawina
you:will:tell to:him he:will:come to:me he:will:see:me
'Tell him to come and see me.' (speaker to WMB)

'Your son told me he'd see you tomorrow.' (speaker to WM(B),
etc.)
Note that the choice of indirect speech in these two utterances may also be
motivated by factor (a); however, this additional motivation is not always
present
To summarise, indirect speech represents the utterance from the viewpoint
of the present speech situation. It is normally chosen to highlight an aspect of
the relevance of the reported speech act to the present speech situation. Direct
speech represents the spoken word from the viewpoint of the situation in which
it occurred, and relationships to the present speech act are played down. In
general, direct and indirect quotations occur in distinct linguistic environments.
There appear to be relatively few contexts in which the speaker makes a
meaningful choice between the two.","[401, 402, 403, 404]"
