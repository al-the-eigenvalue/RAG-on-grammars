"6.7.2Subordinator Particle
There is also one clear case of a subordinator particle, which is kotxi (or kota, dependingon speech variety) ‘because’, as the example in (35) illustrates. The syntactic properties of this
subordinator are presented in chapter 9, in subsection 9.1.3.1.

‘I’ll get going because I’m tired.’6.7.3 Polarity Particles: Negative, Positive
The polarity particles are simply the word forms used to answer polar questions. They
are kona ‘not, no’ and aru1 ‘yes’. As suggested by the gloss, the negative particle kona can be
used as the answer to polar questions and, also, it can negate phrasal expressions. This, however,
is only part of the syntactic functions of polarity particles. The negative particle can be used
more than as an answer to polar questions, and its functions and scope are described in detail in
the context of simplex clauses in the chapter 8, in 8.7.
371One particularity about the positive polarity marker, aru1 ‘yes’, which must be noticed is
that it is the only one (among all particles) that can take the suffix -te ‘really, indeed’, as in
aru1-te ‘yes indeed; of course’. Thus, in this respect, aru1 differs from other particles. Polarity
particles are treated here separately from the discourse particles described next because, although
they may be used under particular discourse contexts with functions that can only be described in
terms of discourse-pragmatic factors, they have a well established prototypical function, namely
to mark the polarity of an event/state or of one of its parts. Aside from that, there is at least one
homophonous form, aru2, whose specific function is to serve as a sort of discourse link, thus
without the meaning associated with a polarity particle.","[402, 403]"
"8.8.2 Interrogative Speech Acts
Interrogative speech acts are conventionally used to seek information, and they
can be divided in two major types: polar questions and information questions. Aside
from the formal differences described in the following subsections, polar and information
questions differ in that the former are marked by a rising intonation.
A detailed description of interrogative sentences in Apurinã was presented in
Pickering 1977b, and a short mention of it in Pickering 1971. Although the data
motivating the analysis presented here (as is also true of every other piece of the
dissertation) are those from my own field research, thus independent from those used by
Pickering, the results do not generally differ in any significant way from Pickering’s first535analysis. Minor differences may be due to a speech variety I have not yet had the chance
to investigate.
8.8.2.1Polar (Yes/No) Questions
Polar questions are used to seek “a comment on the degree of truth of thequestioned proposition” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:179), normally elicit as answers the
positive or negative polarity particles aru ‘yes’ or kona ‘no’ (described in 6.7.3), and are
only marked prosodically by the rising intonation. This conventionalized use of rising
intonation to mark polar questions can, nevertheless, be characterized as a
grammaticalized property of interrogative sentences. In (112), the first two examples
(112a-b) illustrate polar questions for clauses with transitive verbs, and the two last
examples (112c-d) illustrate polar questions for clauses with intransitive verbs. In all of
these examples, the only element that distinguishes the interrogative clauses from their
declarative counterpart is the rising intonation:22s-V-o

ãkiti?
2SG-shoot-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Did you shoot the jaguar?’22I have only recently attested that the speech variety of the Fortaleza village has the morphema –ta, used in the verb
base to mark polar questions. The equivalent of the sentence in (112b) in this speech community will be
pi-keta-ta-ru ãkiti ‘Did you shoot the jaguar?’. This same morpheme is not present in the speech of the Japiim
village.","[566, 567]"
"8.7. Negation
Two basic types of negative forms can be found in the language, namely
periphrastic negation and morphological negation. These types of negation are
presented here in terms of forms rather than scope because it is not the aim of this section
530to present an in-depth description of negation in terms of its scope. Also, for the most
part, the sentence versus constituent scope of negation (Keenan 1964, Payne 1985)
follows from their periphrastic and morphological form, respectively. In Pickering 1978
the author presents a description specifically on negation in Apurinã, where he applies the
traditional tests for determining the scope of negation and the classification thereby
reached. Morphological negation is marked with the negative attributive marker m(a)(described in 5.3.2), yielding an objective descriptive verb. The example in (108)
illustrates m(a)- in a verb that also takes the negative relative marker -katu in a relative
clause (described in detail in the next chapter, in the subsection 9.1.1.1.4):
O
NEG-V-REL.NEG.o
V
upũpe
108. kuki-nhi
m-areka-kati-nhi
man-AFFECT NEG-be.good-REL.NEG.M-AFFECT die
‘The man who is bad died.’
Lit.: ‘The man who is “non-good” died.’
Thus, the Apurinã negative morphological marker is comparable to the English
negative prefixes un- (as in undo, uneasy, unborn etc.), iC- (as in impossible, illogical
etc.), and non- (as in non-existent, non-sense, etc.), except that m(a)- is restricted to the
subclass of objective descriptive intransitive verbs. See 5.3.2 for more on m(a)-.
As the examples in (109a-b) indicate, the periphrastic negation particle kona
(introduced in 6.7.3 as a negative polarity particle) can precede or follow a pre-verbal
constituent:
S NEG V-o
109a. nota kona sa-ru
1SG not go-3M.O
‘I’m not going there.’531NEG S
V-o
b. kona nota sa-ru
not 1SG go-3M.O
‘I’m not going there.’
NEG V-o
c. kona hareka-ru
not be.good
‘It’s not good’
NEG V-o
d. ??hareka-ru kona
be.good
not
??‘It’s not good’
As can be seen from (109c), kona is also the form used in sentences with descriptive
predicates. The example given in (109d), is preceded by question markers to illustrate
the fact that I have no attested instance of a negative particle occurring post-verbally.
As already mentioned in 6.7.3, kona is also the form normally used as the shortest
(linguistic) answer to a polar question, in the role of counterpart of the positive polarity
particle aru. Furthermore, in some speech varieties (for example, the one spoken in the
northern-most village, i.e. Jatuarana) the negative can undergo extreme phonological
shortening. As shown in (110), kona can be shortened to /a/ before a consonant-initial
word or to /n/ before a vowel-initial word:20
NEG#s-V
110a. a#n-ayata-panhi
NEG#hunt-IMPFTV
‘I’m not going to go hunt.’20In these speech varieties, sometimes kona is reduced to just nasalization in fast speech rates.","[561, 562, 563]"

phonologically assigned because, although the phonological ending cannot be segmented
as a morpheme, it can nevertheless work as an audible clue for the speakers’
interpretation of the gender of the noun forms in question; however, it functions as a
rather poor signal insofar as it is bound to lead speakers to make mistakes when using it
to identify the gender of noun forms they are not familiar with.22 Table 31 lists a sample
of nouns whose gender is phonologically assigned:22More details on phonologically assigned gender and default gender in Apurinã have been described in chapter 2 of
Facundes 1994.","[255, 256]"
"3.2.2Grammatical Word
The grammatical word is defined on the basis of morphological and syntacticprocesses that operate on specific word bases which do not necessarily match the
phonological word. Various morphological categories that are restricted to one or another
word class serve as morphological criteria for a grammatical word. A good example of this
is the plural markers (here illustrated in of one its masculine forms), as the examples in (4)
show:
4a. kuku-wako-ru
man-PL-M‘men’b. *uwa muteka-wako-ru
3M run-PL-M(They ran.)c. nu-su-pe-ka-ko
nota watxa
1SG-go-PFTV-PRED-FUT 1SG today‘I’ll get going now.’In (4) the plural marker -wako-ru is a morphological category specific to the word class
nouns (to be properly defined under 3.4.), and, as a morphological property restricted to a
subset of the parts-of-speech found in the language, serves as a morphological criterion to
define a grammatical word. Analogous to -wakoru (aside from many other forms described124in chapter 4), the verbal progressive form -nanu (aside from many other forms described in
chapter 5) can also be used as an example of a morphological category that defines a
grammatical word:
5a. uwa
muteka-nanu-ta
3SG.M run-PROGR-VBLZ‘He’s running.’b. #kuku-nanu
man-PROGR(being a man, “manning”)While -wako-ru was shown to be restricted to nouns, -nanu is shown in (5) to be
restricted to verbs. To the extent that such morphological forms need to make reference
to grammatical words (or to different grammatical classes of words) in order for their
distribution to be accounted for, they serve as evidence for the notion of grammatical
words.
In addition to the morphological criteria described above there are at least three
syntactic criteria that can also be used to define a grammatical word. The first of them is
that some grammatical words are generally permutable with one another. This can be
illustrated with the same examples that were given in (1c, d) to illustrate the pause
phenomenon, where watxa and nu-su-pe-ka-ko alternate positions. The second syntactic
criterion is based on the distribution of the word: A grammatical word can generally be
inserted between two other words. This can be seen by contrasting (5) and (6); in the latter
example the word form owa-kata ‘with her’ is inserted between two grammatical words:
6. uwa
owa-kata
muteka-nanu-ta
3SG.M 3SG.F-ASSOC run-PROGR-VBLZ125‘He was running with her.’The third syntactic criterion used to distinguish grammatical words in Apurinã is that
a grammatical word is the “minimal free word form”, i.e., “[it] is the smallest unit that can
exist on its own” (Spencer 1992:43). This criterion can be illustrated in Apurinã as a
possible answer to what probably is the question I have asked most often in Apurinã. The
question is as given in (7a), and the relevant type of answer to this question is illustrated in
(7b):

"‘How do I say “man”?’
‘man’Notice that, unless the speakers are properly trained in linguistic methodology, they will not
be able to answer satisfactorily a question such as “How do I say a plural masculine
marker?”. Here is one clear instance where speakers clearly distinguish words from their
internal components (introduced later in this section and in the other chapters).",[157]

Generally speaking, information questions (also known as WH questions) “areused typically when the speaker and the hearer share the knowledge of a proposition —it
is presupposed or backgrounded —but the speaker does not know one element in the
proposition” (Givón 1990:2.793). As seen in the next subsections, various elements in a
sentence can be questioned. The major elements within a sentence that can be questioned
using a set of systematic question forms include subject/object, place, time, reason and
manner. The interrogative words are always sentence-initial.
8.8.2.2.1Questioning subject and objectThe form used to question the subject or object of a verb is ke-pa (or ki-pa,
depending on speech variety). As described in chapter 6, interrogative words in Apurinã
can be compared with interrogative words in other languages. ke- and -pa can be
compared with the WH initial in English or the QU initial in Romances languages such as
Portuguese. The difference is that ke- and -pa are more clearly segmentable as
morphemes in Apurinã, whereas the others are synchronically more opaque forms, and
also that ke- and -pa are two recurring forms in interrogative words, whereas there is only537one recurring form in English and Portuguese. The following examples are illustrative of
interrogative words questioning subject/object:
113a. ke-pa
oka-pe-ru
uwa-nhi?
WH-INT kill-PFTV-3M.O 3SG.M-AFFECT
‘Who/what has killed kill him/it?’
b. ke-pa
p-oka-pe?
WH-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV
‘What/who have you killed?’
As the following examples show, when nouns such as suto ‘man’ and xenhi
‘meat’ occur as part of the interrogative word, the argument being questioned is more
specific, being semantically modified by the interrogative word:
114a. ke-suto-pa
kariwa
txa-wa?
WH-woman-INT white.person be-REFL
‘Which woman is a white person?’
b. ke-xenhi-pa
hare-ka?
WH-meat-INT be.good-PRED
‘Which meat is good?’
The interrogative forms in which a noun occurs as part of interrogative words
have been clearly attested in some speech varieties, and were also reported in Pickering
1977b. However, at least one speaker from the Paciá village reported that he himself
would rather use forms such as the following, where nhi- is added to mark subject/object
as a specific one:
115a. nhi-ke-ro-pa
kariwa
txa-wa?
SPEC-WH-3F-INT white.person be-REFL
‘Which woman is a white person?’538b. nhi-ke-ru-pa
ãkiti
oka-pe?
SPEC-WH-3M-INT jaguar kill-PFTV
‘Which jaguar has killed him/it?’
Further research is necessary in order to determine the extent to which this second type of
question marking is common in other speech varieties.
8.8.2.2.2Questioning TimeIn order to question time the TEMPORAL bound form -sawaku is added as part
of ke-pa subject/object interrogative word form, following the gender marker -ru, as the
following example illustrates:
116a. ke-ru-sawaku-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
WH-3M-TEMP-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘When have you killed the jaguar?’8.8.2.2.3Questioning ReasonIn questioning reasons it is the noun form nere ‘will, volition’ that is added as part
of the subject/object interrogative word form, as the following examples illustrate:
117a. ke-nere-pa
kariwa
i-txa-pẽ-ka-wa?
WH-will-INT white.person be-PFTV-PASS-REFL
‘Why has he become a white person?’
b. ke-nere-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
WH-will-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Why have you killed the jaguar?’8.8.2.2.4Questioning PlaceIn order to question places the interrogative word form nhã-pa (or yã-pa,
depending on speech variety) is used. The place interrogative word can occur by itself
539introducing an interrogative sentence questioning a place, as illustrated in (118a), or it
can have a pronominal bound form or the GOAL postpositional marker added into the
interrogative word form, as the examples in (118b-c), respectively, illustrate:
118a. nhã-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
PLACE-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Where did you kill the jaguar?’
b. nhã-õ-pa
o-su-pe-ru?
PLACE-3F-INT 3F-go-PFTV-3M.O
‘Where has she gone?’
c. nha-monhi-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
PLACE-GOAL-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Where have you killed the jaguar?’
There is also an unrelated form that is used to question places, namely atapa-ru
(or ĩtepa-ru, depending on the speech variety). This second interrogative word form for
places does not allow the addition of other forms into it and is generally used in sentences
with nominal predicates, such as the one illustrated in the next example:
119. ata-pa-ru
ãkiti?
PLACE-INT-3M jaguar
‘Where is the jaguar?’8.8.2.2.5Questioning MannerIn order to question manner, the manner interrogative word kanhi-pa is used. The
manner interrogative word does not allow the addition of other forms into it. The
following examples are instances of kanhi-pa being used to introduce interrogative
sentences questioning manner:540120a. kanhi-pa
o-txa?
MANNER-INT 3F-do
‘How did she do (it)?’
b. kanhi-pa
pi-txa-pe?
MANNER-INT 2SG-do-PFTV
‘How did you do (it)?’
For interrogative sentences questioning manner there is also an unrelated form
that can be used, in addition to kanhi-pa, namely natoko-pa, as the following example
demonstrates. This second manner interrogative word also does not allow the addition of
other forms into it.
121. natoko-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
MANNER-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘In which way have you killed the jaguar?’
8.8.2.3Indirect Content Questions
Indirect questions (or dependent interrogatives or embedded-WH questions,(Sadock and Zwicky 1985:186 and Givón 1990:2.804-806) consist of interrogative
clauses whose verbs take an information question as complement. Examples of such
verbs may include ‘ask’, ‘know’, and ‘announce’. Different from languages like English
and Portuguese, however, Apurinã does not make use of interrogative words in indirect
question. Instead, indirect questions use the same formal device of relative clauses
(described in detail in the next chapter, subsection 9.1.1), as illustrated in (122).
122a. nota umaru-ta-ru
u-kama-kutu
1SG know-VBLZ-3M.O 3M-make-REL
‘I know what he made.’
b. nota umaru-ta-ru
o-sãbire-ta-kutu
1SG know-VBLZ-3M.O 3F-talk-VBLZ-REL
‘I know what she talked about.’
5418.8.3 Imperative Speech Acts
Imperative speech acts consists of “syntactic forms that explicitly convey some
subset of requests/commands/orders/suggestions/instructions/entreaties, and so on”
(Sadock and Zwicky 1985:170). Pickering (1971:28) lists various forms as marking
subsets of “imperative verbs”. However, commands, requests and instructions take no
special markers in the spontaneous discourse of any the speech varieties I have observed.
The only form I have observed to occur marking these imperative speech acts is the
bound verbal morpheme -poka, but this form was given by one speaker in elicited data.
The fact that this bound morpheme has been only found in elicited speech may suggest
that it is being left out of the language in more contemporaneous speech varieties. -poka
was described by Pickering as marking a “polite command”. The way they are used now
is more as commands, as the following examples illustrate:
123a. ĩporãã p-apa-poka
watxa
water 2SG-fetch-IMPER now
‘Go get water now.’
b. p-umaka-poka
2SG-sleep-IMPER
‘Go sleep.’
Other than examples such as these above, commands, orders etc. take no
additional marking forms. Instead, they lack a subject expressed by an independent NP;
their subject is expressed solely by the bound pronominal form for the second person
singular subject. In the following examples in (124), the sentences can be uttered as
command in (124a), a request in (124b) (repeated from (74)), and a warning in (124c):542124a. xamuna pu-taka xãã-poki-ã
firewood 2SG-put flame-border-INSTR
‘Put firewood in the fire.’
b. ĩporãã pu-suka-no
water 2SG-give-1SG.O
‘Bring me water.’
c. tsora! pu-muteka!
Tsora 2SG-run
‘Tsora! Run!’8.8.3.1Hortative Speech Act
Hortative sentences can be considered the subtype of imperative speech actwhere “the speaker is encouraging or inciting someone to action” (Bybee et al 1994:179),
thus different from commands, orders, instructions and the like. Hortative sentences are
marked with the clause-initial (h)amo ‘HORTATIVE’ particle already mentioned in
chapter 6. (h)amo is found in clauses about inviting someone to go somewhere, do
something (e.g. eat, dance, etc.) and so on. Aside from occurring only clause initially,
another restriction of this hortative marker is that it can only be used with first person
plural, as the following examples illustrate:
125a. hamo a-su-pe
HORT 1PL-go-PFTV
‘Let’ get going.’
b. hamo a-nhipoko-ta
HORT 1PL-eat-VBLZ
‘Let’s eat.’543c. hamo a-serena
HORT 1PL-dance
‘Let’s eat.’
HORT [s-V-o
O ]
d. hamo [a-kama-ro
ããta ]
HORT 1Pl-make-3M.O canoe
‘Let’s build a canoe”.’8.9. Summary: Evidence for Subject-Object
Distinctions
The notions of grammatical subject and grammatical object can be motivated on
the basis of various ways that the syntactic expressions of notional subject and notional
object behave in the clause, as summarized in Table 1. The distinct marking or
behavioral properties that the syntactic expressions of subject and object have in the same
set of clauses characterize a syntactic distinction between the two.

replaced with -kakaAt this stage in the description of the language no other unambiguous syntactic evidence
has be attested for distinguishing subject from object syntactically. Some of the syntactic
tests generally used to distinguish core grammatical relations are not conclusive, since the
results can be accounted for on semantic or discourse-pragmatic grounds rather than
syntactically. For this reason, I have defined subject and object over the coreferential
544properties of NPs with the pronominal markers in the verb. However, there are certain
problems that arise from defining subject and object over such morphosyntactic markers
(as will be seen in the discussion of relative clauses in the next chapter, in 9.1.1.6).
Finally, the distribution of subject and object NPs in simplex sentences cannot be
predicted on grammatical grounds. Further research is necessary in order to establish
whether/which specific discourse-pragmatic factors play any significant role in the
“decision” of Apurinã speakers to use one or another of the clausal constituent orders
found in the language. Nevertheless, it would appear that none of the clausal constituent
order types in the language can be argued to be more basic/neutral/unmarked than the
other in any way other than in terms of rather theory-specific assumptions or principles,
as will be shown in the next section.","[567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576]"
"1283.3.1Morphemes, Morphs, Formatives, Allomorphs
Perhaps the second issue where morphologists diverge the most, after the definitionof “word”, is as to how to define the notion of a “morpheme” (for those who believe there is
such a thing). Instead of going through attempts to establish an independent definition of
the term (and at the risk of some circularity), I will simply refer to morpheme as an abstract
morphological construct that is particularly useful in describing word structure in Apurinã.
A word may have one or more morpheme in an analogous way that it can also have one or
more phoneme. Since a morpheme is an abstract morphological unit, it requires a phonetic
shape in order to be audibly expressed. The phonetic expression of a morpheme is a morph,
analogously to phone (i.e. the phonetic expression of a phoneme). Moreover, since it is a
common assumption in the morphological literature that “the term ‘morph’ implies the
realization of a morpheme” (Bauer 1994), so much so that a morph that does not realize a
morpheme is called an empty morph, I will reserve the term formative to refer to both
morphs that do and morphs that do not realize a morpheme; also, I will use the term
formative when I want to be intentionally vague (or neutral) as to whether a form realizes or
not a morpheme (Idem, Anderson 1985:150, 161). “Formative” will then be the superordinate term for morph and empty morph (in a way roughly similar to the term
exponent/exponency, also found in the literature, Bauer 1994:243 and Spencer 1991:41).
Finally, morphs that do realize a morpheme and that are conditioned by a phonological,
lexical or grammatical context will be called allomorphs of that morpheme (Bauer 1994:15,
analogously to allophone in phonology). The difference between the notion ‘allomorph’ and
the notion ‘morph’ is that it is part of the definition of the former that its phonetic realization129is conditioned by the phonology, lexicon or the grammar of the language. Such
conditioning factors are not part of the notion ‘morph’.
Having introduced the labels above, I will now summarize the sort of properties that
will be considered relevant for the identification of formatives in the language. As was the
case for words, morphemes can also be described in terms of their form and meaning. In the
ideal cases each morphemic form will correspond to a specific meaning, so that the ideal
morphemes will consist of a particular form that is consistently associated with one specific
meaning. This is the so-called one-to-one mapping between form and meaning (Anderson
1988:151-153). If, however, all there was to a morphological description was the
description of one-to-one mappings between the forms and meanings of various formatives
there would probably be no reason to even describe morphology separately from syntax. In
some cases it is not easy to decide whether certain forms constitute allomorphs of the same
morpheme, different morphemes, or whether they even are segmentable formatives at all. It
is precisely because many other factors may be involved in the identification of formatives,
aside from the form-meaning mapping, that I will make use of a list of factors which will
constitute useful guidelines in the identification of morphemes. The list of factors used here
follows partly from an extrapolation of the properties described in Bauer 1994, chapter 8, as
those identifying affixes and bases. The properties to be considered in the identification of
formatives are then as in (9):
9a. meaning of a putative formative;
b. function of a putative formative (verbalizer, nominalizer etc);
c. (phonological) form of a putative formative;
d. part of speech of the word base (noun, verb etc.) that a putative formative attaches to;130e. phonological, grammatical or semantic restrictions on the word base that a putative
formative attaches to;
f. range of allomorphs displayed by a putative formative;
g. form a putative formative imposes to the word base;
h. whether a putative formative is required before another formative can occur in the same
word base, i.e. whether it potentiates a subsequent formative;
i. degrees of productivity of a putative formative;
j. whether a putative formative occupies a position class in the base;
k. whether a putative formative is in complementary distribution with another one;
l. recurrence of a putative formative.
No single property in (9) is used here as a necessary and sufficient condition for the
identification of a formative; rather, the list constitutes a range of properties commonly
associated with formatives that can be analyzed as morphemes or allomorphs or empty
morphs. When used in combination these properties will serve as a set of procedures to
identify not only the general morphological unit formative (as opposed to morphologically
inconsequent phonological chunks), but also the sub-type of formative in question, i.e.
allomorph, morpheme or empty morph. The data to be represented in chapters 4-7 will
provide examples where some of the decisions on whether a formative constitutes a
morpheme or not will be, ultimately, a theory-driven judgment. However, the properties
listed in (9) will (hopefully) provide completely consistent results. Table 1 lists the values
for each of the relevant properties that will determine whether a putative formative realizes a

I- Meaning: Morphemes and allomorphs will normally have a meaning systematically
associated with them, whereas both empty morphs and non-formatives will not;
II- Function: Morphemes and allomorphs may have a function associated with them (e.g.
nominalizer, verbalizer, etc.), whereas both empty morphs and non-formatives will not;
III- Form: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs will normally have a constant
shape with predictable variations, whereas non-formatives will not;
IV- Part of Speech of base (P.O.S.): Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may be
restricted to a specific word category, whereas this may not happen to non-formatives;
V- Restrictions on base: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may also be
restricted to bases with specific phonological or semantic properties, whereas this does
not happen to non-formatives;
VI- Range of allomorphs: Morphemes and empty morphs may not only exhibit
allomorphic variants, but also different morphemes and different empty morphs may
exhibit distinct allomorphic variants, whereas non-formatives may not exhibit such
variants at all;
VII- Form imposed on base: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may cause
systematic changes in the underlying form of a base, whereas non-formatives will not;
VIII- Potentiation of other formative: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may132“create a suitable base for” another formative, whereas non-formatives will not;
IX- Degree of productivity: Morphemes and empty morphs may exhibit degrees of
productivity that may be used to distinguish between two morphemes or two empty
morphs, whereas non-formatives may not;
X- Position class: Morphemes, their allomorphs, and empty morphs may occupy a
position class in the word it occurs within, whereas non-formatives will not;
XI- Complementary distribution: Allomorphs of the same morpheme will always be
mutually exclusive, whereas morphemes, empty morphs or non-formatives will not;
XII- Recurrence: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs will recur in the word
bases they are allowed to occur, whereas non-formatives will not;
Therefore the list given in Table 1 works as sort of tests to determine whether
something is a formative or not, and what type of formative it is. As seen in this table, every
positive value assigned to the category morpheme implies a positive value to the category
allomorph. This follows from the assumption that every morpheme is necessarily realized
as at least one allomorph. Thus wherever there is a morpheme there will necessarily be at
least one allomorph, whereas the converse does not hold. The application of the tests given
above will be illustrated as they are applied in chapters 4-6.
A necessary initial step in the description of the structure of words is to establish
(preliminarily) the classes of words found in the language. Some introductory notes on the
major classes of words found in the language are in order and are presented next.","[159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"

Thus, once we have added CN2s to the typology of classifying systems, it comes
as no surprise to note DeLancey’s suggestion of the existence of a continuum from pure
noun to pure classifier, and that such continuum can be observed in the syntactic and
semantic behavior of certain nouns and classifiers. Such a continuum has been attested in
the form of class terms in some South-East Asian languages. CN2s in Apurinã then
would constitute another manifestation of similar continuum, this time in an Amazonian
language.
4.1.1.2.4Remarks on the Semantic Nature of C(lassificatory)N(oun)2sIn the previous sections we have seen that Apurinã has CN2s; that CN2s are the
recurrent elements in productive noun compounding; that some CN2s can be used as
anaphor-like nominal elements that can be incorporated into the verb in a manner similar
to certain verb incorporated classifiers; and that CN2s play important grammatical roles in187the morphology, syntax and the lexicon of the language, as well as that they can
encompass important discourse and pragmatic roles.
In the analysis presented above for CN2s, I have suggested that there is enough
synchronic evidence pointing toward a continuum within which the nature of CN2s can
be understood. When we look at CN2s in productive compounding by isolating parts of
this continuum based on observable differences in their semantic or syntactic behavior,
we identify parts of the mechanisms by which lexical meaning “emerges” as a result of
language use and language variation. In terms of their semantic properties, we have seen
that CN2s have two sources currently attested: most CN2s derive from plant parts/nature
elements, and a few others derive from body parts. The fact, however, that there are too
few instances of the latter cases does not allow us to discard the possibility that further
investigation may reveal that all CN2s have plant parts/nature elements as source
meanings. Moreover, CN2s occur as one of the elements in a productive noun compound
and they refer to anatomical properties of the derived meaning of the compound. Thus,
CN2s may refer to semantic properties of nouns which fall into two or three of the
following meaning categories: (i) plant parts/nature elements (as source meaning), (ii)
body parts (as derived meaning and, perhaps, also as source meaning), (iii) manufactured
elements (as derived meaning).
Based on the descriptive information above, two important questions can be asked
about CNs:
I - What is the motivation which may lead the same CN2s with the semantic field
in (i) to be used to refer to the semantic field in (ii) and/or in (iii), or those with the
semantic field in (ii) to refer to the semantic field in (iii)? Furthermore, can we say188anything on why the source semantic field is (i) rather than (ii), when the converse seems
to be more well attested crosslinguistically?
II - In terms of the semantic internal structure of CN2s, which are the semantic
properties that are preserved or abandoned as CN2s have their meaning extended with
accompanying semantic bleaching?
The semantic development of CNs suggests a number of semantic changes that
can be explained through metaphorical extensions of particular source meanings into
particular target meanings. One type of semantic change observed was that which occurs
when plant parts have their meaning extended to refer to body parts. In contrast, another
semantic change occurs with the extension of meaning from plant parts to manufactured
elements. For instance, there is a sense in which the use of -muna in ãã-muna ‘tree’ is
different from its use in kiri-muna ‘animal’s nose’; and the use of -muna in aiko-muna
‘house bean’ is different from both of the previous uses. In the first case, -muna refers to
the properties of a plant; in the second case, -muna refers to the properties of a body part;
and in the third case, -muna refers to the properties of a manufactured element. Is it the
case that, in the three cases, -muna carries the same meaning properties? If yes, then
what are these meaning properties? Are the various uses of -muna a case of polysemy or
homonyny?
As Sweetser points out “[n]o historical change of meaning can take place without
an intervening stage of polysemy. If a word once meant A and now means B, we can be
fairly certain that speakers did not just wake up and switch meanings on June 14, 1066.
Rather, there was a stage when the word meant both A and B, and the earlier meaning of
A eventually was lost” (1991:9). In that view, -muna could be, conceivably, treated as an
instance of polysemy. Now, does this help us answer question I or II posited above?
189How can we show that each instance of -muna in words like ãã-muna ‘tree,’ aiko-muna
‘house beam,’ kiri-muna ‘animal nose’ etc... corresponds to different word meanings that
happen to be expressed in the language by the same phonological form? If we followed a
strict version of the polysemy view, we would end up having to accept a lexicon
consisting of lexical entries such as -muna1, -muna2, -muna3, -muna4, -muna5 etc... which
when applied to the other CN2s of the language would generate a close to infinite number
of lexical meanings the language learner would need to memorize. This certainly is not a
desirable result. If on the other, we assume that there is enough similarities among the
various uses of -muna that justifies to treat them as semantically related in some way, we
find ourselves in the position of having to show which “similarities” those are.
Question I could be answered if we made use of the some sort of cultural mode
underlying the use of CN2s. We may take CN1s (i.e. plant parts/nature elements and
perhaps body parts) to constitute the set of semantic properties expressing a source
domain, whereas CN2 (manufactured elements) would constitute a target domain. In
order to understand, express or conceptualize elements within the target domain,
elements of the source domain are used. The meaning of CN2s would emerge out of the
mappings between image-schematic models containing “specific schematic images,
such as trajectories or long, thin shapes or containers” (Lakoff 1986:31). There would be
three of such image-schematic models involved here, one for (i) plant parts/nature
elements, another for (ii) body parts and, finally, a third for (iii) manufactured elements.
These mappings could be characterized as metaphoric mappings within a metaphoric
model (idem), in which elements from one image-schematic model maps onto another
one, as (i) maps onto (ii), (i) maps onto (iii), and (ii) maps onto (iii), as in the diagrams
below:

ELEMENTSFig. 5: From Plant Parts & Nature Elements to Manufactured ElementsBODY PARTSMANUFACTURED
ELEMENTSFig. 6: From Body Parts to Manufacture Elements
Apurinã then would have conceptual mappings of a sort that motivate the
meaning alternation of CN2s. As a first approximation, Apurinã could be said to have the
following global conceptual metaphoric mapping:
THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ANIMAL BODIES/MANUFACTURED
ELEMENTS ARE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PLANT PARTS OR
NATURE ELEMENTS.
Fig. 7: Generic Metaphoric Model
A version of such a conceptual metaphorical mapping in Apurinã could be
grounded on the Apurinã cosmology wherein plants and non-human animals are treated
as the same sort of beings —as attested in the Apurinã creation mythology. Thus, what
we would be finding is that there would be a generic metaphoric model embedded into an
Apurinã idealized cultural model (or an Idealized Cognitive Model, see Lakoff 1987)
which would work to motivate the use of certain semantic domains in connection with
other semantic domains, in this case, the semantic domain of plant parts/nature elements
191in connection with that of body parts (Fig. 4), or of plant parts/nature elements in
connection with that of manufactured elements (Fig. 5), or the semantic domain of body
parts in connection with that of manufactured elements (cf. Fig. 6). Within this semantic
analysis, CN1 and CN2 can be treated as items that constitute a natural category (see
Lakoff 1982); their commonality consists of the similarities perceptually identifiable in
their semantic contribution to the derived compound noun, such similarities consisting of
shape and/or consistency. Physical shape and consistency are the general set of semantic
features making an anatomical image-schematic model that, once made available to the
speakers, can be extensively used with CN2s with functions beyond that of a simple head
of a noun compound. That is when CN2s can be used as modifying elements with
attributive function in nouns or in verb incorporation.
In order to answer question II, we need a more detailed analysis of the semantic
features (properties) of CN2s; we need to specify the shape and consistency properties
involved in the mappings posited in Figures (4-6). In order to motivate the properties of
CN2s in terms of image-schematic mappings, we need to specifically describe which
particular properties are being mapped between domains. That is, it still remains to be
said which of the several different “physical properties of Plant Parts/Nature Elements”
are associated to the “physical properties of Body Parts/Manufactured Elements,” and so
on. This is what is dealt with in the next paragraphs.
A semantic analysis of the data allows us to make sense out of the descriptive
facts by positing schematic models which would motivate the association of the semantic
fields given in (i)-(iii) above. Such an analysis also allows us to note that it is the
perceptually salient physical properties inherent to (i) and/or (ii) that are mapped onto (ii)
and/or (iii). However, we have only been able to account for the semantic classes whose
192properties are associated to one another (through metaphorical mappings), and to
motivate only one very general set of properties involved in the semantic mappings,
namely the set of “physical salient properties.” The obvious question then would be
“How do we know which properties are salient?” One way to find the answer to this
question would be to perform psycholinguistic experimental tests such as those used in
Prototype studies à la Rosch 1977. Another possibility would be to use linguistic
information through a structural analysis of the data. It is the structural analysis that
follows below.
The CN2 -muna can be used to illustrate how the data presented in the paper
indicate that it is that the most salient features inherent to the source domain (i.e. CN1)
turn out to be preserved in the target domain (i.e. CN2). As we have already seen
above, -muna can only be used with plant parts names (when used with the plant
parts/nature elements category) to refer to trees with large trunks. It is generally the case
that such large trunks have as salient perceptible properties the fact that they are ‘thick,’
‘rigid,’ and ‘cylindrical’. Hence ‘thick,’ ‘rigid’, and ‘cylindrical’ can be naturally
interpreted as the salient source meaning properties of the CN2 -muna. Now, having
established the source salient properties of -muna, we can examine which of such
properties remain or are lost when -muna is used to refer to body parts or manufactured
elements. As seen in the Table 13 below, the ‘rigid’ property is lost when used to refer to
body parts, but maintained when used to refer to manufactured elements. Thus, the
recurring properties of -muna across categories are ‘thick’ and ‘cylindrical’.
In Table 13, I extend the analysis for each CN2 in order to illustrate the recurring
properties which can be observed when CN2s refer to the shape or consistency of plant
parts/Nature Elements, body parts, and manufactured elements. Hence, in Table 13 we
193track the original salient properties for each CN2 as such properties are preserved or lost
when the CN2s are used with any of the relevant noun categories. As a result, we arrive
at the (presumed) “core” properties, that is, meanings that may recur across categories, as
summarized in Table 14.
Thus, in Table 14 the “core” properties can conceivably be taken to be the
specific features which are mapped from the source to the target domains which were
represented in Figs. 4-6.","[217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225]"

presentation of the dissociation between core grammatical relations and semantic roles
but will NOT affect the final results of the analysis in the ways that are relevant for
motivating subject and object in Apurinã. The generalized “agent”-like semantic role
will be called actor, whereas the “patient”-like semantic role will be called undergoer
(idem). The example in (47) aims to illustrate that subject can be dissociated from its
most typical semantic correlate, i.e. actor. So, in the following example uwa-nhi

of object with undergoer. Rather than an assumption, however, such correlations are well documented in the works

"7.1. The Meaning/Function of Special Bound
Formatives
The following subsections describe briefly the meaning and functional properties
of the various types of special bound formatives. More detailed description of the
meaning/function of these formatives will be provided in chapter 9, in the appropriate
syntactic contexts. As will be seen in the various subsections below, the grammatical
functions associated with special bound formatives do not yield other word
(sub)categories; instead, they more often add grammatical meanings that are overtly378reflected in the noun phrase or in the clause, thus being inflection-like formatives. The
order of presentation of each formative follows their internal distribution in the word base
they attach to. This distribution will be summarized in terms of position classes in 7.2.
I should also note that in various subsections below one may feel the need to ask
why certain forms are described as morphological units (rather than syntactic ones) when
they are clearly associated with predicates, phrases, clauses or even discourse functions.
The answer to this question follows from the definition of word and the domain of
morphology as described for Apurinã in chapter 3. In its relevant definition, a word can
be as complex as a phrase or clause; in fact, a word can stand syntactically as a phrase or
as a clause. However, since the primary goal of morphology is to describe the structure
of words, words need to be morphologically described even when they can stand by
themselves as a phrase or clause. This in no way means that all formatives which are
morphologically described cannot be syntactically described as well, or even described as
to their discourse functions. To the contrary, such formatives are only morphologically
described insofar as their place in the word needs to be established. Their precise
function, however, in some cases can only be properly described within the syntactic or
discourse domain. With this in mind, we can now proceed to analyze the
meaning/functional properties of special bound formatives.","[409, 410]"
"6.4 Interrogative Words
Interrogative words in Apurinã are complex morphological forms that result from the
combination of various formatives. Interrogative words are those used clause-initially to
introduce information questions. They take different forms and are used to introduce
interrogative clauses when questioning subject/object, reason, place, manner, or time, as
indicated in Table 5:6

have already seen i-ye being described in Table 3 as the masculine demonstrative form. The
immediate question that arises is whether the discourse particle and the demonstrative are just
different functions of the same morpheme, or whether they are actually different morphemes.
There are reasons to say that the latter alternative better describes iye. That is, it would appear
that the discourse particle iye is already a lexically distinct word. The main evidence for this is
the fact that iye but not *oye (the feminine demonstrative counterpart) can be used as a discourse
particle. Similar reasoning applies to aru2 in relation to the positive polarity marker aru1.
Discourse particles are the sort of words that are generally not offered by speakers in
elicited material and which they usually find difficult to translate into Portuguese. These same
particles, however, are pervasive in natural (non-elicited) discourse, and they usually occur
preceded as well as followed by short pauses. The proper analysis of discourse particles requires
knowledge about the organization of discourse structures, something beyond the scope of this
work. The examples in (36) illustrate the usage of some of the discourse particles:

Although further investigation is required on the syntactic functions and distribution of the
words described here as particles, it is possible to say that at least some of them present
properties distinct from those of other closed word classes. Other particles may turn out to be
better described as part of a subclass of other closed (or even open) word classes. This, however,
can only be determined on the basis of further research.","[403, 404, 405]"
"2154.4. Noun Stem Morphology
In the previous section we have seen that nouns can be derived from verb forms.
In this section I will survey the inventory and describe the word internal distributional
and functional properties of these affixal formatives that can occur within certain bases,
here called noun stems, to form a noun. The notion of ‘noun stem’ can be understood as
the nominal unit which results from adding the bound formatives described in this section
to a root base. I will refer to the bound formatives that attach to a root base to form a
noun stem as noun stem formatives. Thus, a noun stem is a root base plus one or more
noun stem formative(s).
As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, nouns can be grammatically
defined in terms of their syntactic and morphological properties. As follows from this
definition, morphological properties which are restricted to nouns distinguish them from
other parts of speech, and, moreover, this does not mean that nouns cannot share other
properties with other parts of speech, but rather that these shared properties cannot be
used to identify a word form as a noun morphologically.
As I have already anticipated in the previous chapter (under 3.4.1.1) I will NOT
make use of the notions of inflection or derivation (or its derived terms such as
inflectional or derivational morphemes/morphology...) for the simple reason that such
notions can only be defined on a theory internal basis. I will, nevertheless, make brief
comparisons, where especially relevant, between the language internally motivated
notions of noun stem morphology and noun morphology. Noun stem morphology
consists of the properties involved in the word formation of noun stems, whereas noun
morphology consists of the properties involved in the word formation of nouns and
216absent in the word formation of noun stems. In using perhaps typologically “un-userfriendly” labels I am trying to be coherent with the decision of favoring language internal
motivated labels where these may be at odds with more common terms found in the
typological literature. It is arguable whether noun stem morphology is “simpler” in any
way than noun morphology. However, the idea is not that the morphological forms that
occur with nouns are individually more complex that the morphological forms that occur
with noun stems (though arguments could also made in this direction), but rather that the
overall structure of nouns is more complex than that of noun stems. It is in this sense that
I will argue that, at least in a naïve sense, nouns are more complex than noun stems. One
way in which these terms will also prove useful is in avoiding the biases that notions such
as derivational and inflectional morphology would bring into the analysis of the Apurinã
noun morphology.
Finally, before describing the noun stem morphology, let me repeat for
convenience the cluster of evidence that will be (heuristically) used in the identification
of formatives (i.e. morphemes, their allomorphs or empty morphs). The properties listed
in Table 26 are repeated from Table 1 of chapter 3. I will only make explicit use of these
properties where the evidence is not overwhelmingly in favor of analyzing a formative as
a morpheme, allomorph or empty morph; otherwise, their use will be made implicitly (i.e.
I will use but not mention them):217Table 26: Defining Properties of Formatives

NO4.4.1 Gender Markers: Masculine -ru1 versus Feminine -ro
All nouns, including those derived from other categories, are either masculine or
feminine for the purpose of cross-referencing marking with other elements within a
syntactic construction. Masculine and feminine gender can be marked morphologically
or they can be morphologically unmarked. Unmarked masculine/feminine gender is the
one for which no formal grammatical marker is added to the verb. There are various
ways to tell the gender of an unmarked noun form in natural discourse, all involving a
coreferential formative found in the modifier, determiner or in the predicate. This is
illustrated in the following examples in (64a) and (64b), where in the first clause tata
‘“umari”’ cross-references the feminine pronominal object form in the verb, whereas in
the second clause yowata ‘knife’ cross-references the masculine pronominal object form
in the verb:21864a. ata nhika-ro tata
we eat-3F.O umari
‘We eat “umari”.’
b. nota atama-ru
yowata
I
look-3M.O knife
‘I saw the knife.’
Different from languages such as Portuguese and French, Apurinã does not show
cross-referencing between the elements inside nominal phrases, as the possessive
constructions in (65) illustrate:20
65a. uwa
yowata-ne
3SG.M knife-POSSED
‘his knife’
b. owa
yowata-ne
3SG.F knife-POSSED
‘her knife’
Nouns that are morphologically unmarked for gender constitute the majority of
the Apurinã nominal lexicon. They include sex-non-differentiable nouns such as those
listed in Table 27. As can be gathered from Table 27, the great majority of
morphologically unmarked noun stems referring to sex-non-differentiable elements is
assigned to the masculine gender.","[246, 247, 248, 249, 250]"

Department of LinguisticsDedicationPopukarũwakorumonhi Popũkarowakoropakunu, para os meus pais and hâi Kade.iiAcknowledgementsFirst and foremost I wish to thank all of the Popũkaruwakoru people who adopted
and cared for me while I was in the field, and who taught me their language. Among
them I thank most especially to the two Mipa Xirĩkaya, to Itaruru, Mainharu, Tokatxi,
Kasãtomaro, Mokato, Koyoru, Matu, Kaneepa, Oyaka, Xirikoyaro, Powami,
Bernaldinho, Artur, Pedrinho, Conceição, Chico Preto, Catuta, Antonio Apurinã, and so
many others. Special thanks go also to Matthew Dryer for guiding me through the
process of writing the dissertation, helping me to learn what I knew and what I still
needed to know about Apurinã and about linguistics. My thanks also to the other readers
of the dissertation, Karin Michelson and Wolfgang Wölck for all of their comments,
suggestions and critiques, and to Sasha (Alexandra Aikhenvald) for making me come to
terms with other Arawak languages. Most special thanks to my parents and to Kade for
their love, care and trust. I thank all the professors of the linguistic departments of
SUNY-Buffalo and of the University of Oregon who in different times taught me
different ways of doing linguistics; among them I thank especially Colette Grinevald,
who first taught me how to go about writing a grammatical description. Late thanks go to
Sarah Lichtenstein, who for some years shared with me certain critical views that need to
be taken into account no matter what. Thanks to Denny Moore, who supported my early
work in important ways. Finally I thank the friends and colleagues who made graduate
school easier and pleasant, and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e
Tecnológico (CNPq), Inter-American Foundation, World Wildlife Fund, and WennerGren Foundation for the financial support during part of my graduate studies.

Facundesfor the degree ofDoctor of Philosophyin the Department of Linguistics to be taken January 2000Title: THE LANGUAGE OF THE APURINÃ PEOPLE OF BRAZIL
(MAIPURE/ARAWAK)A somewhat typologically informed grammatical description of the Apurinã
language is provided, including historical, socio-cultural, demographic and geographic
information about the Apurinã society. The Apurinã communities spread along
tributaries of the Purus River, in western Brazilian Amazon. The grammatical analysis
consists of the phonology, morphology and syntax, with appendixes on language
variation and the design of the Apurinã ortography, a text sample, a vocabulary list, and a
preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari. The grammatical analysis is
based on language internal factors, though with some typological observations on major
aspects. The segmental phonology is simple; morphophonemic alternations are restricted
to pronominal subject/possessor markers and a few other bound morphemes. Stress is
predictably penultimate, though with exceptions that need further investigation.
Although a preliminary analysis of prosodic structures is suggested, more work is
required in this area. The morphology is complex and includes special bound forms
which are partially distinguishable from typical affixes. Nouns and verbs are clearlyxxviidistinct syntactic categories; however, property-referring words are describable as a
subclass of intransitive verbs. Classificatory nouns are used as part of productive noun
compounding and a subset of them can be verb-incorporated and refer back to physical
and shape properties of participants previously mentioned in the discourse —in this way
resembling verb incorporated classifiers of North American languages. The description
of the syntactic organization of the language involves, to a great extent, examining the
functions and behavior of bound morphemes, and reaches its highest complexity in the
system of relative clauses. A subset of property-referring words, called objective
descriptive verbs, presents a morphologically marked split intransitivity system which is
partly based on the semantic class of these verbs. Such a system is typical of Arawak
languages. The constituent order is semi-free; the VO order is the most frequent in texts,
but the patterns of word order correlations point to OV. Overal, the Apurinã language
constitutes a laboratory for examining the interplay between morphological forms and
syntactic structure and functions, providing certain grammatical and semantic categories
and structures that resemble only in part those attested in other languages.xxviiiList of Abreviations and other Conventions UsedA

1.0. Introduction
The purpose of this dissertation is to present a preliminary grammatical
description of the Apurinã language. Apurinã is spoken by the Apurinã indigenous
people of the Northwestern Amazon region of Brazil. The Apurinã population may vary
in number depending on the parameters used to identify as Apurinã a person of Apurinã
ancestry living out of contact with an Apurinã community. Intra-culturally, these
parameters may be determined by the extent to which this person (and/or others in his/her
environment) is aware of his/her Apurinã ancestry. Sometimes, a person may claim the
Apurinã ancestry for potential government help (poorly) provided to indigenous peoples.
The dissertation is organized as follows: Chapter 1 is the introduction, where
some general information on the language and the people who speak it is presented;
chapter 2 presents the phonemic inventory, articulatory phonetics and phonological
analysis of the language, in addition to the orthographic system for the language; chapter
3 presents an introduction to Apurinã morphology where the major concepts used in
chapters 4-7 will be introduced; chapters 4-6 present the morphology of the noun, verb
and closed word classes in that order, and the their relevant syntactic properties; chapter 7
presents a special set of bound morphemes that share properties of affixes as well as of
independent words in a clitic-like fashion; chapter 8 presents the constituent structure
1analysis of phrases and the clause, an analysis of grammatical relations, predicates and
the syntactic properties that operate at the level of simplex sentences; chapter 9 presents
the structure of complex sentences; the conclusion summarizes the major aspects of the
Apurinã grammar covered in this work and points to parts of the grammar that deserve
further investigation. Appendix A summarizes some general information on issues
involved in the design of the Apurinã orthography and on a general picture of dialectal
variation. Appendix B provides a text sample consisting of an Apurinã traditional story.
Appendix C provides a vocabulary sample of the language. Finally, appendix D presents
a summary of a lexical comparison involving Apurinã and its closest extant languages,
Piro and Iñapari to arrive at a preliminary phonological reconstruction of Proto-ApurinãPiro-Iñapari.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]"
"Perfectivity Marking: -pe, -panhi
There are two perfectivity markers that can attach to noun bases, pronoun basesor verb bases, namely the perfective and imperfective aspectual markers. One can argue
that aspectual markers should NOT be considered as part of the noun or pronoun
morphology, since the scope of such a marker is the event/state rather than the referent of394the noun or pronoun in question. Or, conversely, one can argue that word bases taking
perfectivity markers are not noun or pronoun forms since they take marking forms
associated with the event/state expressed in the verb. Although, in a general sense, both
arguments could be correct in other languages (or in Apurinã under a different view of
the domain of morphology), the fact is that the word forms described below as taking
aspectual markers fit the definition of grammatical words given in chapter 3, regardless
of their translation into English. In other words, there is no reason to think that
perfectivity markers make a noun or a pronoun into a verb. In the following subsection, I
will merely illustrate some examples of noun, pronoun and verb bases marked with
perfectivity markers. I will return to the discussion of perfectivity markers in chapter 8,
in 8.6.2, where I will provide a more detailed description of the semantics of perfectivity
markers. In translating clauses marked with perfectivity markers, I will use the English
perfective form have V-ed to translate the perfective marking, and the English form
still/yet to translate the imperfective marking. Although this does not constitute a
“perfect” translation of the perfectivity markers, it covers some of their most typical
meanings —which will be described in detail in chapter 8.6.2.

pan-NMLZ-3F go-PFTV‘The pan-maker has left.’-muna can also be used with animate nouns, in which case the derived form refers
to ‘the one who kills N’, where N refers to animates. Here, again the derived nouns are
inflected for gender, as shown in (87):
87a. n-atama-ta-ru

1SG-look-VBLZ-3F.O chicken-NMLZ-3F‘chicken killer’Of all the usages described above, that illustrated in (87) is most common across
distinct speech varieties. It appears, however, to be harder to attest the use of -muna with
forms referring to feminine referents (especially women) for at least two reasons: first,
because -muna generally occurs with nouns implying specialized tasks which (for
whatever reason) are generally restricted to men; and, second, because most of the nouns
in the language are masculine nouns. Moreover, as happens to -iko, -muna is also low in
productivity, since it actually occurs with just a few of the nouns it could logically occur
with.
The word forms taking -muna are clearly nouns morphologically, as is attested by
the fact that they take gender markers. Also, there is no question that -ru1 in
244ãkiti-muna-ru1 is just a gender marker, rather than the object marker for third person
masculine, i.e. -ru (described in detail in chapter 7, in 7.1.12) or the unpossessed marker
for alienable nouns, i.e. -ru2 (described under 4..4.3). If the morpheme in question were
the object marker -ru, it could be replaced with any other object person marker (as in
*ãkiti-muna-no/-i/-wa... [jaguar-NMLZ-1SG.O/2SG.O/1PL.O...]), which is not the case;
and, if it were -ru2 it could be replaced with -re2 in the possessed form (as in *ãkiti-munare2 [jaguar-NMLZ-UNPOSS]), which is also not the case. Finally, the word formation
rules for actor nominalization is then as in (88):

V+muna
ru1
88. NSt → 
N+muna+ro 
Finally, although the few instances of words taking -muna are all NOT possessed,
I suspect that such words are not sensitive to the alienable versus inalienable marking
distinctions. My suspicion is that nouns marked with -muna can occur either possessed
or unpossessed if the appropriate contexts can found. Unfortunately, however, the
instances of such noun forms are too few to allow any satisfactory conclusion on this
matter. More data is required here.","[274, 275, 276]"
"24One of the most beautiful expression of the Apurinã culture that still survives in
some villages is the /knr/, a festival organized by one village and to which people from
the neighbor villages are invited. Since the hosts are supposed to serve plenty of food and
beverages to their guests, it is not every community that can afford to host the festival.
Generally, in order to organize the festival, the hosts need to spend some time hunting
and fishing in order to provide food for their guests. Aside from that, the hosts need to
provide the beverage and, hence, have plenty of fruits and roots out of which the beverage
is made. When talking Portuguese the Apurinãs refer to this festival as “xingané”. This
word derives from the Apurinã word xikane ‘toucan’, and probably refers to what once
was one specific type of festival. Reports by elders (and by Ehrenreich 1891) reveal that
in the past they had several types of festivals, usually named after an animal. I have not
been able, however, to assign a translation to the word /knr/. Nowadays, there are two
types of festivals: Roughly speaking, one in which people celebrate a welcoming event,
and another that may be done a few days after the death of a family member. The latter
kind, however, may have some of its motivation influenced by Catholicism, following the
tradition of Catholics to hold a mass some time after the death of a family member.
Instead of holding a mass, however, the Apurinãs organize the festival, with much
dancing and singing of Apurinã traditional songs. A special event that is part of the
festival is the ritual of arrival, in which the visitors arrive screaming and giving shots with
their guns pointed upwards. They go in line around the village with firm steps and
screaming in a thick voice, until a leader in the host village comes to confront a leader
among the guests in a fast-speaking ceremonial speech. Since this fast speech is an
obligatory part of the ritual and since it seems to follow certain conventions in terms of
25asking and answering questions, there usually are only a few people in the villages that
can do it. In fact, the people responsible for this sort of ceremonial speech specialize in it
in the same way that some Apurinãs also specialize in carrying the singing through the
night. The difficulty in getting good quality recordings of this ceremonial speech has not
allowed me yet to analyze it and verify whether the language used in such a special
occasion is significantly different from the language used in everyday speech.
Apparently, the original function of such a ritual was to assure the hosts of the festival
that their guests were indeed who they said they were, and not, for example, spirits
disguised as people. The content of such a ceremonial speech would appear to consist of
a description of family ties, and events that will assure the hosts that the guests really are
who they claim to be. Much of the ceremonial speech as well as the whole ritual of
arrival are purely symbolic nowadays, thus having lost some of their original meaning
and, to some extent, perhaps some of their shape. Nonetheless, both the ceremonial
speech and the ritual of arrival are required parts of the /knr/ and a community that
lacks people able to perform those activities will usually NOT be able to hold the festival.
In sum, despite all the changes that the Apurinãs and their culture have undergone,
they still preserve unique ways of interacting and construing the world. Although such
interactions and ways of viewing the world are in some ways comparable to other
(distinct) cultures, they also make the Apurinãs one people with a specific set of practices
and its own belief system.","[55, 56, 57]"
"6.1 Pronouns
As a class of words, pronouns form the only category whose members combine to encode
person, number and gender, or a combination of these meanings —depending on the pronoun in
question. Pronouns have no inherent morphology and, as such, can be distinguished
morphologically from nouns and verbs in lacking the morphology that is inherently nominal or
verbal. The only bound formatives that attach to pronominal bases will be described later in
chapter 7 as part of the special class of morphological forms discussed in that chapter. There are
seven independent pronoun forms, as listed in Table 1, four in the singular and three in the
plural. The gender distinction is only expressed in the forms for 3rd singular.",[376]
"6.7.1Adverbial Particles
Certain particles have meanings that include time, manner, degree, spatial deixis, thussemantic properties reminiscent to certain adverbs in European languages. These particles are
here called adverbial particles, a label which will be more properly justified as some of the
distributional properties of these particles are presented below. Time (or temporal) expressions
refer to parts of a day, and to shorter or longer periods in the life of a person or group of persons.
The following table lists the adverbial particles currently attested:367Table 6: Adverbial Temporal Particles
GlossAdverbial Particles
watxa
oposo
mitxi
atana
katana
kitxaka
kutatu‘today’
‘after’
‘first, initially’
‘yesterday’
‘tomorrow’
‘in ancient times’
‘in ancient times’The following examples in (30) illustrate some of the adverbial temporal particles:
30a. ã-apo-pe
watxa
1SG-arrive-PFTV today
‘We arrived today/now.’
b. oposo u-sa-ru
after 3M-go-3M.O
‘He then left.’
c. mitxi Ø-una-ru
first 3M-come-3M.O
‘First, he came.’
d. kuta
nu-sa-ru
yesterday 1SG-go-3M.O
‘I left yesterday.’
e. and so on.
As illustrated by watxa ‘today, now’ in the examples in (31), adverbial particles have a
“loose” distribution within the clause, with no formal marking or semantic consequences:
31a. watxa nu-su-pe-ka
today 1SG-go-PFTV-PRED
‘I’ll leave now.’
b. nu-su-pe-ka
watxa
1SG-go-PFTV-PRED today
‘I’ll leaving now.’
368There is one reasonably clear case of manner adverbial particle in the language, which
is the form arĩkika ‘slowly.’ As shown in (32), ari%kika, can occur before (32a) or after (32b) the
modified predicate:
kuku
apo-pe
32a. arĩkika sãki-rewa-ta-karu
slowly speak-INTR-VBLZ-RELZ man
arrive-PFTV
‘‘The man who speaks slowly arrived.’
b. sãki-rewa-ta-karu
kuku apo-pe
arĩkika
speak-INTR-VBLZ-RELZ man
arrive-PFTV slowly
‘‘The man who speaks arrived slowly.’
Notice in the examples above that the manner adverb, in both instances, modifies the meaning of
the predicate adjacent to it.
Some meanings that are associated with adverbs in European languages (insofar as they
refer to the intensity of an event/state, the degree to which or the manner in which it takes place)
are expressed by bound forms in the verb in Apurinã. Examples of these are –ka
‘INTENSIFIER’, -wari ‘almost’, and -ãpo ‘RANDOM’ (described under 5.2.1.1). Other
adverb-like meanings are expressed as verbal constructions, such that, in terms of their
translation equivalents, instead of saying ‘He runs rapidly.’ one would say ‘He’s fast.’
Other semantically adverb-like particles include a pair of spatial forms used with deictic
functions. Analogous to the demonstratives, these spatial adverbial forms can be distal, i.e. far
from the speaker (or other deictic center), or proximate, i.e. close to the speaker/hearer (or other
deictic center), as listed in the following Table 7:
Table 7: Adverbial Spatial Particles
Gloss
‘here’
‘there’Forms
wai
werã
369The examples in (33) illustrate the use of distal and proximate adverbial particles:
33a. n-awa-ru
wai
1SG-exist-3M.O here
‘I live here.’
b. nu-sa-ru
werã
1SG-go-3M.O there
‘He went there.’
One important information related to the approximate adverbial particle wai is that there
is a phonologically identical form that can be used as a descriptive verb. So, the conventional
way to greet a person when visiting an Apurinã village is by uttering (34a), for which (34b) is the
conventional answer:
34a. wai-ka-i
pite
be.here-PRED-2O 2SG
‘Hi there…!’
Lit.: ‘Are you here?’
b. wai-ka-ra-no
nota
be.here-PRED-FOC-2O 1SG
‘Hi, I’m here!’
Lit.: ‘It’s here that I am!’
Both in (34a) and (34b) the form wai is used as a descriptive objective verb which takes the
object pronominal marker to express its notional subject. There are two possible analyses of
these examples as far as the form wai is concerned. The basic question is whether the proximate
adverbial particle and the object descriptive verb are different words or whether they actually are
the same word, namely a proximate adverbial particle that can be used (as other words can) as
the predicate of a “verbless” clause. In this work I will treat wai used in an object descriptive
predicate as a descriptive objective verb, and wai used with an adverbial-like function as an
370adverbial particle. It is conceivable, however, that this is ultimately a purely terminological
issue.
Another terminological issue is whether adverbial particles should not be described as an
independent word class equivalent to the word class adverbs in European languages. The reason
I have included adverbials as a subclass of particles rather than as an independent word class is
that adverbs, like other particles, share the property of lacking any inherent morphological
property. Ultimately, this may be another simple matter of terminology which is immaterial to
the description of the language.","[398, 399, 400, 401, 402]"

pass’, ‘to run’, and ‘mouth of’ are accountable by the phonologically conditioned rule given
in (29) of chapter 2. As was noticed in chapter 2, nasalization fluctuates in such an
environment. Because nasal and oral vowels are in free variation when preceding a nasal
consonant, pronominal markers that appear nasalized in such an environment will not be
141taken to constitute a separate set of pronominal allomorphs. The first set given above can be
argued to constitute the elsewhere cases, thus representing the basic/underlying forms out
of which other forms can be derived as a result of the rules presented at the end of this
subsection. The fact that in Table 2 (as well as in the next tables) the form for third plural
subject/possessor is realized as the (putative) discontinuous formative /-...-na/ in verbs is
here analyzed as a result of a discontinuous dependency relation between the two formatives
/-/ and /-na/. In other words, the forms in question occur in mutual dependency to perform
a (combination of) function(s), namely to encode third person plural in the verbs. The
morpheme /-/, given here as the third person plural for nouns, occurs in only some speech
varieties, while in others /-...-na/ is used for both verbs and nouns. I will ignore this
distinction here, and will mention it again in chapters 5 and 7. A more detailed
morphological description of these pronominal markers will be presented in 7.1.1.
The second set of pronominal markers, given in Table 3, occurs when the word
forms the markers attach to either start with a palatal or palato-alveolar consonant, cf.
/ika/ ‘to eat’, /apoka/ ‘to fill up’, /ipa/ ‘lice of’, /erepi/ ‘arrow of’, or when these
words belong to a subset of body parts, cf. /mekita/ ‘wings of’ and /kiri/ ‘nose of’:142Table 3: Set 2 of Subject/Possessor Forms1

the other that is lexical. They are phonologically conditioned when they occur preceding a
palatal or palato-alveolar consonant, and they are lexically conditioned when they occur
with a few nouns referring to body parts. Note that most body part terms do NOT take set 2
forms; the word for ‘my head’ is /n-k/, not */i-k/; the word my ‘his nape’ is /nok/, not */i-nok/, and so on. Presently, it would appear that the body part terms that take
set 2 forms constitute an arbitrary set.
The third set of pronominal markers consists of those that only occur when the word
form that they attach to starts with a vowel, thus in a phonologically conditioning
environment:1In the various tables listing the pronominal markers, shaded columns highlight the ways that the forms deviate from
the basic forms.","[172, 173, 174]"
"595Finally, the example in (43) (repeated from 16a) illustrates a complex sentence
with ClREL whose VREL maintains the progressive aspect marker, -nanu. The presence of
an aspect marker in the VREL distinguishes it from the typical cases of nominalized verbs
—where markers of finiteness (i.e. tense and aspect) are generally not allowed (Givón
1990:idem), hence providing one more piece of evidence for the verbal status of VRELs:

V
43. suto
atama-nanu-ta-karu
kuku apo-pe
woman see-PROG-VBLZ-REL.M.S man arrive-PFTV
‘The man who was looking at the woman has arrived.’
The types of verbal and nominal properties that are found for VRELs can then be
summarized as in Table 3:
Table 3: Properties of ClRELs
Verbal Properties
. take object bound pronouns
. maintain aspect markers
. relativizers are pronominalNominal Properties
. take oblique markers
. function as NP subj/objAs it is clear from this table, the current evidence suggest that although VRELs have
properties that are clearly verbal they also have some properties associated with complex
nouns or NPs.
One final remark on the syntactic category of VRELs is that a definitive syntactic
evidence for the verbal/nominal status of VRELs may be provided by the syntactic
expression of the notional object of transitive VRELs. The question would be whether the596syntactic expression of this notional object can be demonstrated to behave as a
grammatical object or, for example, as possessive. Further research is necessary here.","[626, 627, 628]"
"6.6 Interjections
Interjections are the word forms that are used with particular exclamatory purposes, like
calling somebody, screaming, expressing pain, surprise, or other sort of feelings. A systematic
survey of exclamatory words in Apurinã still needs to be carried out, since gender and age
(among other) factors seem to play a role in determining the use of such words. The examples in
(29) illustrate some of these exclamatory words. As shown by (27c), some particles can also be
used with exclamatory functions:
29a. hei!‘man answering a call’b. oh!‘woman answering a call’c. ha!‘initiating story-telling’d. ateeneka!",[397]

still uncertain of, as will be made explicit in the subsections where they are respectively
described. Except for the forms having a question mark, all other relative pronominal
markers in the language have been clearly attested. As suggested by the information
summarized in Table 1, the relative pronominal markers form a rich system for coding
various piece of information about the relative clause and its components: i.e. the
grammatical relation of the headREL in the relative clause, as well as its gender and
number; the (positive/negative) polarity of the verb; the “actorlessness” of the verb; and a
sort of hierarchical role of the participants when expressed as pronominal forms.
Although it is possible to break down the relative pronominal markers given in Table 1
564into component parts, for the moment they will be described in terms of the general
function these four-segment phonemic clusters have as markers of ClRELs. The final
subsection in 9.1.1.5 will present a more detailed morphological breakdown of these
tetrad-partite phonemic clusters, with a discussion on the syntactic status of the verb
which results from the presence of such clusters.
Various of the examples illustrating the use of relative pronominal markers
originate in elicited material. I have chosen to use such data here for two major reasons:
First, because they are used systematically enough in elicited material so as to suggest
that speakers are aware of their function in the language grammar, and, second, because
some of the relative pronominal forms are not easily found in text material (in, general,
regardless of genre). The extent to which they are not found so often in text material may
suggest that (at least for some speakers) they are in the process of going out of use, either
due to language contact influence or just as a natural consequence of internal language
change. The next subsections describe each of the functions of the relative pronominal
forms listed in the table above, and the subtypes of ClRELs distinguished by these
pronominal forms.
9.1.1.1.2The Role of the HeadREL in the Relative ClauseThe first opposition encoded by the relative markers that is illustrated below is
that concerning their role in the clause while encoding core grammatical relations, i.e.
subject and objects. The sentences in (6) illustrate two independent clauses. The subject
of the first and second clauses are both suto ‘woman’, and (in the context used here) they
are coreferential. In order to relativize the subject of the first clause, i.e. suto, making
this subject a headREL, the coreferential relative pronominal marker -karo is added to the
565verb of the first clause. The resulting complex sentence (containing a relative clause) in
(7) (already given above in (2) is formed when the two sentences in (6) are combined:
O
S
V
6a. kuku suto
karota
man woman hurt
‘The woman hurt the man.’
S
V
b. suto
apo-pe
woman arrive-PFTV
‘The woman arrived.’
S/S
[O
V-rel.s ]ClREL
V
7. suto
kuku karota-karo
apo-pe
woman man hurt-REL.F.POS.S arrive-PFTV
‘The woman who hurt the man arrived.’
That is, as a result of adding -karo to the verb of the sentence in (6a), this sentence is
“nominalized”, becoming a relative clause embedded as the subject of the matrix clause.
(The meaning of the term “nominalized” as it applies to ClRELs is discussed in detail in
9.1.1.6.)
In contrast to (7) the next example in (8) has suto again as the headREL and kuku
karota-kuto ‘whom the man hurt’ is the ClREL:
S/O
[S
V-rel.o
]ClREL V
8. suto
kuku
karota-kuto
apo-pe
woman man
hurt-REL.F.O
arrive-PFTV
‘The woman whom the man hurt has arrived.’
While in (7) the relative pronominal marker is -karu, the example in (8) shows a different
pronominal marker attached to the verb, namely -kuto. As is clear in (8), when the
relative pronominal marker -karo is replaced with the relative pronominal marker -kuto
566the result is that the headREL suto is interpreted as the object of the ClREL. Note that since
suto ‘woman’ is the headREL in both the complex sentences in (7) and (8) there is no
difference in person or gender information. Moreover, since everything else in (7) and
(8) is the same, the only distinct grammatical functions -karo and -kuto may correspond
to is that of subject and object, respectively. Hence the relative pronominal markers
directly encode the subject versus object grammatical distinction.
In (9a), the example illustrates a case where the headREL, suto, is the goal
argument of the verb of the ClREL, nhipoko-ru2 nu-suka-kuto ‘whom I gave the food to’,
whereas in (9b) it is nhipoko-ru2 ‘food-UNPOSS’ that is the headREL, showing that both
the expressions for undergoer (here including the argument of objective descritive verbs)
and the expressions for goal arguments follow the same relativization strategy:
S/O

‘The food that I gave to the woman was good.’
In complex sentences containing ClRELs the only grammatical relation which is
relevant for relativization is that played by the headREL in the ClREL. That is, the role of
the headREL in the matrix clause is completely irrelevant for the formal encoding of
relativization in Apurinã. This irrelevance of the role of the headREL in the matrix clause
for the formal markings of ClRELs can be seen by comparing the examples given in (7),
(8) and (9) with the following examples in (10). In all the examples of ClRELs in (7), (8)
and (9a) the headREL is subject in the matrix clause, and both the relative pronominal
567markers -karo and -kuto occur in all those examples. In the examples in (10), the object
pronominal marker -ro in n-apoko-ro shows that the headREL suto is object in the matrix
clause, and, again, both -karo and -kuto occur:

can also be marked for gender and number in ways that can potentially help to identify
the role of the headREL. Insofar as gender and number help to (indirectly) determine the
core grammatical relation of the headREL they function as redundant markers of the
syntactic role of the headREL in the ClREL.
In order to demonstrate how gender is encoded by the relative pronominal
markers, we can start by observing the gender of the headREL in (7) above, contrasting it
with the following example in (11). While in (7) the headREL is suto ‘woman’, which is
modified by the ClREL kuku karota-karo ‘who hurt the man’, in (11) the headREL is kuku
‘man’, which is modified by the ClREL suto karotakaru ‘who hurt the woman’. When we
contrast examples (7) and (11), where the headRELs differ in that one is feminine and the
other is masculine, we see that the relative pronominal marker agrees with the gender of568its respective coreferential headREL. The way this gender agreement is shown is by
alternating the last vowel of the relative pronominal marker, i.e. /o/ versus /u/:
S/S
[ O
V-rel.s ]ClREL
V
11. kuku suto
karota-karu
apo-pe
man woman hurt-REL.M.POS.S arrive-PFTV
‘The man who hurt the woman has arrived.’
Analogously to (7) and (11), (8) and (12) can be compared to produce similar
results for the relative object pronominal markers. So, while -kuto in (8) was shown to
agree with the headREL suto, in (12) the relative object pronominal form -kutu is shown to
agree with the headREL kuku.
S/O [ S
V-rel.o ]ClREL V
12. kuku suto
karota-kutu
apo-pe
man woman hurt-REL.M.O arrive-PFTV
‘The man whom the woman hurt has arrived.’
Finally, another piece of information about the headREL that is encoded in the
relative pronominal marker is the number. In the examples in (13) the clauses illustrate
the plurality expressed in the pronominal relative markers for subject and object,
respectively. -kanu is used for subject plural in (13a), coreferential with the plural
headREL suto-wako-ro ‘women’; whereas in (13b) -kunu is used for object plural, also
coreferential with the plural headREL sutowakoro:

The following examples in (14) are analogous to those in (13), and they have the
masculine headREL kuku-wako-ru ‘men’ coreferential with the plural relative pronominal
markers in the verbs. These examples are only given to show that plural relative
pronominal markers (both subject and object forms) do not encode the gender distinction.
That is, the relative pronominal forms -kanu and -kunu can agree with both masculine
and feminine nouns, as the examples below show; in other words, there are no feminine
plural forms such as *-kano or *-kuno.

and (10) with the following examples in (15). The first difference to note is the addition
of the privative marker ma- to the verb. As shown in 5.3.1, ma- is a negation marker that
forms descriptive verbs. When the example in (15a) is compared with (7), it becomes
clear that the relative pronominal marker changes its form to agree with the negative
marker ma-. The comparison can also be made between (10) and (15b) to produce the
570same analytical result. The way the relative pronominal marker changes is by alternating
between the polarity markers -r and -t, where the first marks positive and the latter marks
negative polarities:

[neg-V-rel.s
]

15a. suto

Notice that, although polarity markers are restricted to descriptive verbs (i.e.
intransitive verbs that take object rather than subject pronominal markers), subject but not
object relative pronominal markers inflect for polarity. This is unexpected, since
descriptive verbs take object rather than subject pronominal markers.
9.1.1.1.5The Distribution of Relative ClausesIn analyzing the position of the ClREL in relation to the headREL (or vice-versa)
there are three possible outcomes. The first possibility is for the ClREL to precede the
headREL; the second is for the ClREL to follow the headREL; and, the third is for the ClREL
to occur discontinuously on both sides of the headREL. The labels prenominal,
postnominal, and circumnominal (or internal-head) relative clauses are found in the
literature (Keenan 1985:143, Comrie 1989:45-46) referring to ClRELs when they occur,
respectively, before, after, or on both sides of the headREL. These labels are used here in
the description of the distribution of ClRELs.
571In all examples of complex sentences containing a relative clause seen so far the
ClREL follows the headREL, thus characterizing the postnominal type of relative clause.
This constitutes the most common and, in an informal sense, the “unmarked” distribution
of the ClREL in relation to the headREL. Postnominal ClRELs are “unmarked” in the sense
that they are the ones naturally offered by the speaker when translating relative clauses
from Portuguese, they are the most frequent type, and, most importantly, because they
also are the ones most easily accepted by the speaker.2
Prenominal ClRELs are also attested in texts as well as in elicited material, as the
following examples in (16) show. In (16a) suto atama-nanu-ta-karu ‘who was looking at
the woman’ is the ClREL that precedes the headREL kuku ‘man’. In (16b) the ClREL is kuku
atama-nanu-ta-karo ‘who was looking at the man’ which precedes the headREL suto
‘woman’:

In the examples in (16) the headREL functions as subject of the ClREL. In (17) the
examples are illustrative of complex sentences whose headREL functions as the object of2One could argue that speakers may be influenced by Portuguese (wherein postnominal ClRELs are the only type found)
while translating Portuguese ClREL into Apurinã; however, speakers’ judgments of postnominal ClRELs are the same
when these clauses are presented to them in Apurinã. Moreover, a Portuguese influence would NOT explain why
prenominal ClRELs are disfavored/rejected in the same contexts where postnominal ones are preferred —as the
following paragraphs show.","[595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603]"

"268Chapter 5Verb Morphology
5.0. Introduction
The focus of this chapter will be on the internal structure of verbs and their
syntactic properties; that is, how verbs are formed and the subcategories that may arise
from their morphological and syntactic properties. As nouns, verbs take bound
formatives that only attach to verb forms (i.e. bound formatives that are inherently
verbal), as well as, also, formatives that occur outside of the inherently verbal
morphology. The majority of this outer-layer morphological forms are not inherently
verbal insofar as they can attach to nouns, pronouns and/or a few other closed word
classes (depending on the bound formative in question). In this chapter I will focus
exclusively on the morphological forms that are inherently verbal, that is, the bound
formatives that only occur as part of verb bases. The bound formatives that occur outside
of the inherently verbal morphology will be described as a special class of bound
formatives in chapter 7.
Verbs in Apurinã, as a part of speech, can be distinguished from nouns on the
basis of various syntactic and morphological properties. An example of an inherently
nominal morphological property is the plural marker -wako-ru1/-wako-ro.
-wako-ru1/-wako-ro, which was described in the previous chapter, in 4.5.1, as a number
marker, and is further illustrated in (1a) where it attaches to the noun stem kãkutu
269‘people’ to mark plural. The example in (1b), on the other hand, illustrates the fact that
-wako-ru1/-wako-ro cannot occur with verbs:
1a. hãkiti-nhi
kãkutu-wako-ru1 keta
jaguar-AFFECT person-PL-M
shoot
‘The (male) people shot the poor jaguar.’
b. *hãkiti-nhi
kãkutu keta-wako-ru1
jaguar-AFFECT person shoot-PL-M
(The (male) people shot the jaguar)
In the verb reside the most complex morphological structures found in the
language. Although the interaction of verb-internal forms with typical syntactic functions
is constant, this chapter surveys only the processes and verb forms (through which such
processes are formally encoded) that need to be considered in building a grammatical
verb category. The ways by which these processes and verb forms are relevant for the
clausal and propositional units are described in chapters 8-9.
Analogous to nouns, verbs can consist of elements that are prefixed or suffixed to
a verb base (here used as a neutral term to refer to any verbal unit to which bound forms
can be added). It will become clear when these elements are presented in the rest of this
chapter that the verb morphology (like the noun morphology) is predominantly suffixal.
Among 31 position classes (i.e. slot positions, including those described in chapter 7)
clearly identified in the base of non-descriptive verbs (i.e. those that are not propertyreferring verbs, see 5.1.1.1.1, 5.1.1.2, and 5.2), 30 are suffixal and only 1 is prefixal.
Although the morphology of descriptive verbs (i.e. property-referring verbs) is more
limited, it includes a subset of the non-descriptive verbs morphology plus two prefix
positions inherent to descriptive verb bases. The number of (mutually exclusive)
formatives that can occur in each of such position classes can vary from one to seven.
270Most position classes consist of only one formative. The set of subject/possessor
pronominal markers may have seven or five members depending on how one interprets
the homophonous forms used both in the singular and plural. Both the pronominal
marking sets (which will be described in detail in chapter 7, in 7.1.1 and 7.1.12) are given
in Table 1 below for convenience, since they will be referred to very often as important
verbal properties:

-roAs I mentioned in the chapter 3 (under 3.6.1), the third person plural marker that occurs
with verbs, i.e. u-... is in a discontinuous dependency relation with the plural marker
…-na, such that both u-… and …-na will always co-occur in order to encode third person
plural. Although …-na has been added to Table 1, it occupies its own position class in
the verb —as will be made clear in chapter 7, in 7.1.1.1. As it is clear from Table 1, these
pronominal markers behave as cumulative morphs (in Anderson’s [1988:154]
terminology, or as multiple exponence or cumulation in Spencer’s [1991] terminology,
or as portmanteau morphs1 in Bauer’s [1994:17] terminology). What all these terms1Linguists, perhaps from different linguistic traditions, use the term “portmanteau” to refer exclusively to morphemes
resulting from the contraction of morphs (e.g. Spencer 1991:50) or to morphemes that accumulate meanings (e.g.
Bauer 1994:17).","[299, 300, 301, 302]"
"415Among all the special bound formatives described in the various subsections
under 7.1, only the oblique markers (described under 7.1.2) and the restrictive marker
(i.e., -nanu, described in 7.1.9) do not occur attached to verb bases (cf. discussion in 7.2.2
on the status of potential exceptions to the former cases). Examples that illustrate the
position classes represented in Table 2 are given in (47):

examples are, nevertheless, given here in order to make complete the list of examples that
motivate the linear position for each of the special bound formatives in question. Table 3
lists the position classes that special bound formatives occupy inside the noun base.
Among all the special bound formatives that were described in the subsections
under 7.1, only the gerund marker (i.e., -inhi, described in 7.1.4), “passive” marker (i.e.,
-~ka, described in 7.1.8) and the pronominal object markers (described in 7.1.12) do not
occur attached to typical noun bases (cf. discussion in 7.2.2 on the status of potential
exceptions to latter cases). The examples in (48) illustrate the position classes of special
bound formatives as given in Table 3:

To the extent that special bound formatives occur also attached to some closed
word classes, the same position classes provided in Table 3 for noun bases generally
apply to pronoun bases, particle bases, and numeral bases. One clear exception, however,
consists of the subject/possessor pronominal markers. These pronominal markers never
occur with closed word classes. Moreover, certain other restrictions on the presence of
special bound formatives with closed word classes still require further verification with
native speakers. Of all closed word classes, pronouns, numerals, and temporal or deitic
particles are the word categories that most often take special bound formatives. The next
examples show some of these closed word classes taking special bound formatives. (49)
illustrates the presence of special bound formatives in pronominal bases:

"442Chapter 8Simplex Sentences
8.0. Introduction
This chapter describes both the constituency and relational properties of syntactic
expressions (i.e. NPs and NPobls) of the arguments of the verb and the various properties
of clauses and predicates found in the language. Particular attention is given to the NPs
encoding notional arguments required by the lexical meaning of the verb to show the
evidence that can be used to construe the core syntactic relations subject and object.
Chapters 3-7 have presented the internal morphological structure and the syntax of word
categories. Now it is also time to show whether it is required to make use of syntactic
notions different from the purely structural ones, and, furthermore, if such notions can be
motivated, to show what types of constructions arise when relational and constituent
syntactic properties are considered, and what their distribution in the clause is. Before
describing the relevant data and their syntactic status, a few syntactic labels need to be
introduced and properly defined.
In the previous chapters, I have used the term “clause” to refer to any construction
involving a (pro)nominal form (including bound pronominal markers) plus some
predication of it. In this and the next chapters I will continue to use clause to name any
syntactic construction containing a single predicator. So, the examples in (1a-b) are both
instances of clauses. In (1a), su-pe-ka-ko ‘go-PFTV-PRED-FUT’ is the predicator and
443nota ‘1SG’ is the argument of the verb; in (1b), sãpaka-pe-ka ‘be.tired-PFTV-PRED’ is
the predicator, and nota ‘1SG’ again is the argument of the verb:
1a. nota su-pe-ka-ko
1SG go-PFTV-PRED-FUT
‘I’ll get going.’
b. nota sãpaka-pe-ka
1SG be.tired-PFTV-PRED
‘I’m already tired.’
Furthermore, I will reserve the term sentence to name any one or more clauses
that can stand by themselves in Apurinã discourse. That is, an Apurinã sentence will
consist of a single independent clause or of an independent clause plus one (or more)
dependent (i.e. subordinate, see chapter 9, section 9.1) one(s). So, each one of the two
examples in (1) above constitutes an instance of a sentence, as well as the combination of
an independent and a dependent clause in (2):
2. nu-su-pe-ka-ko
kotxi
nu-sãpaka-pe-ka
1SG-go-PFTV-PRED-FUT SUBORD 1SG-be.tired-PFTV-PRED
‘I’ll get going because I’m already tired.’
What is of interest in this chapter are the mono-clausal sentences, as represented by the
examples in (1), rather than multi-clausal sentences, as represented by the example in (2).
In order to facilitate the presentation of mono- versus multi-clausal sentences I will refer
to the former as simplex sentences, and to the later as complex sentences. Complex
sentences will be dealt with in the next chapter. I should note that the term “simplex”
(rather than “simple”) is used here so as NOT to imply that the relevant sentences are
necessarily simpler in any trivial way than complex sentences, since it is possible for
certain simplex sentences to involve more complex structures than certain complex ones.
444In using the terms just introduced I intend to make a compromise between presenting a
description of the Apurinã syntax in terms of concepts that can be clearly motivated in
the language on the basis of its internal properties and that, at the same time, are
crosslinguistically sound.
Therefore, sentence, as it is defined in the syntax of Apurinã, is an abstract
construct that can only achieve audible realization through clause(s). What the next
sections will show is that such an abstract concept is not only useful but, also, it can be
easily motivated on the basis of the data to be described in this and the next chapter.
Moreover, such a definition of the Apurinã sentence will partly match the (perhaps) most
often cited general definitions of “sentence” found in the linguistic literature, such as the
ones represented by (3-8):
3. “The sentence is considered here not as a unit consisting of a predicate and nouns
related to it (a simple clause), but rather as a combination of such units (clauses) into still
larger structures of a sort here summarized.” (Longacre 1985:235)
4. “The sentence is the largest unit of grammatical description.” (Bloomfield, as
presented in Lyons 1968:172)
5. “As a grammatical unit, the sentence is an abstract entity in terms of which the linguist
accounts for the distributional relations holding within utterances.” (1968:176)
6. “[T]he sentence in turn can be defined as the maximal unit of syntax, or the largest
unit over which constructional relations hold.” (Matthews 1981:29)
7. The sentence is “[t]he largest unit in terms of which the grammar of a language is
organized.” (Crystal 1992:349)4458. “In generative grammar, [the sentence is] the syntactic category which is taken as the
largest category capable of syntactic characterization, all of its component parts being
bound together by rules of syntax and its entire structure being well-formed.” (Trask
1992:250-251)
However, one should also bear in mind that there are perhaps as many putative
crosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” as the number of different syntactic theories.
The definition used here follows from the properties of the Apurinã grammar as well as
(partly) from what implicitly or explicitly is found in some of those putative
crosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” (such as the ones given in 3-8). In the way
conceived here, the notion of “sentence”, as unit of syntax, is an abstract construct in a
way analogous to the way in which “phoneme”, as a unit of phonology, and “morpheme”,
as unit of morphology, also are abstract constructs.18.1. The Structure of Phrases
The goal of this section is to motivate and describe the constituent structure of
clauses. In providing evidence for parts of speech as units involved in the organization of
clauses, by implication, I have also provided motivation for treating words as constituents
of the clause. What needs to be examined now is the extent to which words can combine
into larger constituents within a clause. There is no question that words constitute
individual constituents within the clause. So, for example, in the first of the three clauses
in (9a), suto ‘woman’ occurs preceding the verb apo-pe ‘arrive-PFTV’. As shown by the1I have found particular useful the discussions in Lyons 1968:172-180 and Matthews 1981:ch.2 on the various
definitions of “sentence”, where detailed references on the subject are also provided.","[473, 474, 475, 476, 477]"
"593have some properties that are more typical of NPs and/or complex nouns in Apurinã, and
other properties that are more typical of verbs in this language.
The morphological evidence for the nominal status of VRELs can be illustrated by
examples like the one in (41):
s-V
S GOAL APPOS
[ s-V-rel.o-goal
]
41. i-txa
kema owa
hãtako-ro Ø-anhi-kuto-mokaru
3M-say tapir 3F.SG youth-F
3SG.M-take-REL.F.O-GOAL
‘The tapir said to her, the woman whom she took away.’
In this example the VREL is anhi-kuto-mokaru ‘to whom it took’, which follows the
appositive headREL hãtako-ro ‘young woman’. What is relevant in this example is the
presence of the goal bound oblique marker -mokaru following the VREL. As shown in
chapter 7, in 7.1.2.4, the goal oblique marker is part of the (pro)noun morphology, and, as
shown in chapter 8, in 8.3.1.2, it can be used to mark a goal object, as well as, as shown
in 8.3.2.4, a directional goal (allative) grammatical relation. The presence of an obliquer
marker such as -mokaru attached to a VREL would suggest that VRELs are somewhat
nominalized (or “deverbalized” forms).
The syntactic evidence for the nominal status of VRELs is that complex sentences
can have a ClREL and, at the same time, lack a headREL —as shown in 9.1.1.2 with the
description of headless ClRELs). The existence of headless ClRELs is evidence for the
nominal status of VRELs to the extent that intransitive VRELs in headless ClRELs will
function as the NP subject/object in the complex clauses where they occur —as the
example in (31b) is illustrative of.
Therefore, based on these two morphological and syntactic properties associated
with ClRELs, a preliminary conclusion is that the tripartite morphemic forms involved in
594relativization nominalize (or deverbalize) the verbs they attach to and, hence, form
nominal (or deverbal) constructions.
The first problem, however, with the conclusion above is that the simple fact that
these same tripartite morphemic clusters encode gender, number and core grammatical
relations (typical nominal properties) shows that they are pronominal forms as well.
Thus, one can argue that if relativizing morphemes are pronominal forms they are less
likely to change the category of the verbs they occur with and, as a result, VRELs are
expected to be verbal, not nominal. The assumption held here is that pronominal
elements are not generally used in most languages to yield new word categories.
Furthermore, in addition to these pronominal properties, the following examples show
other properties that the morphemes in question also have and that suggest that they mark
verbal rather than nominal constructions. In (42) (repeated from 36a), the ClREL is a
nominal predicate with two interesting aspects that require observation: First, the
relativization is marked with -karo attached to the copula verb inha, and, second, the
verbal reflexive bound form -wa follows the relativizing form. The presence of -karo
attached to the main verb is ambiguous because this specific copula verb form occurs
both with nominal predicates and with descriptive verbal predicates,6 but, the presence of
the verbal reflexive morpheme -wa following -karo constitutes unambiguous evidence
that the VREL is somehow verbal —not nominal:

6No example is available to decide whether the relativizing forms can also attach to the purely verbal auxiliary form
txa.","[624, 625, 626]"
"4.4.3 Unpossessed Markers: -txi and -ru2
Analogous to possessed markers, the occurrence of the unpossessed markers -txi
and -ru2 is determined by the lexical properties of the free and bound roots which they,
respectively, occur with. There are also many unpossessed nouns that do not take
either -txi or -ru2, and which, instead, are formally unmarked for unpossession. The
unpossessed marker -txi was presented in 4.1.1 as the formal marker of inalienable nouns;236it was illustrated in (4), Table 3, and is further illustrated in (76), where the noun root
serẽka ‘dance’ takes -txi when unpossessed and no formal marking when possessed:
76a. awa-ru
[serẽka-txi]
there.be-3M.O dance-UNPOSS
‘There was dance.’
b. ata [serẽka]
1PL dance.POSSED
‘our dance’
Therefore, the meaning of serẽka can be described in a manner analogous to the
way the meanings of ããta and kota- were described in (73), as shown in (77). That is,
‘dance’ is the content meaning of the root form serẽka, where ‘MASCULINE’ and
‘INALIENABLE’ are grammatical meanings this root subcategorizes for:
'dance'



’
MASCULINE
77. serẽka ‘

INALIENABLE
-ru2 was presented under 4.1.3 as the formal marker attached to bound roots to
form unpossessed nouns of the mixed class (i.e. the class of noun stems that are
morphologically marked when possessed or when (un)possessed. It was also seen that, in
order for these bound roots to be possessed, the mixed possessed marker -re2
replaces -ru2 in the bound root. Examples of -ru2 were illustrated in (51) and in Table
(22), and are further illustrated in (78), where the bound root nhipoko- ‘food’ takes -re2
when possessed and -ru2 when unpossessed:

The way to describe the meanings of mixed nouns was illustrated in (73b).
As was anticipated under 4.3 and illustrated in (60), repeated below as (79), the
unpossessed marker for inalienable nouns -txi can also be used as a nominalizer. In (79)
the verb form nhipoko-ta ‘to eat’ takes -txi to become a noun:
79a. nota nhipoko-ta
1SG food-VBLZ‘I did the eating.’b. nota apoka-ru
nhipoko-ta-txi
1SG find-3M.O food-VBLZ-UNPOSS‘I found a place-for-eating/
something to eat with’Therefore, following the same reasoning used to analyze the possessed markers in
the previous subsection, -txi and -ru2, on the one hand, have the common property of
marking unpossessed nouns, and, on the other, they differ in that -ru2 participates in the
(un)possessed marking pattern that characterizes mixed unpossessed nouns (as described
in 4.1.3), whereas -txi participates in the marking pattern that characterizes inalienable
nouns (as described in 4.1.1). The complementary distribution of -txi and -ru2 consists
then of the fact that the former occurs only with inalienable nouns, whereas the latter
occurs only with a mixed unpossessed nouns (i.e. those whose corresponding possessed
counterpart is marked with -re2). However, as was shown in (60), -txi can also be used
with verbs. To incorporate this into the meaning/function of -txi, we can revise the
statement about the complementary distribution by saying that “-txi occurs with
inalienable nouns AND some verbs”. Furthermore, there is evidence that -ru2 also occurs
with verbs. Some speakers interpret the form /takaru/ (where taka means ‘to plant/put’)
238as either a verbal form meaning ‘to plant/put it’ or as a noun form meaning ‘plant’. This
dual interpretation suggests that there actually are two homophonous forms expressed as
/takaru/: The first one is taka-ru, where -ru is the third masculine object marker that
occurs with verbs (as will be described in detail in chapter 5 and 7); and the second form
is taka-ru2, where -ru2 is the unpossessed marker. If this analysis is correct it would
explain why taka functions as a verb in (80a) and (80b), but as a noun in (80c):
80a. komeru nota taka
manioc 1SG plant/put‘I planted/put manioc (in).’b. nu-taka-ru
komeru
1SG-plant/put-3M.O manioc‘I planted/put manioc (in).’c. nu-maporoka-ru
taka-ru2
1SG-pull.out-3M.O plant/put-UNPOSS‘I pull out the plant.’Thus, a more precise description of -txi and -ru2 needs to state that -txi occurs with the set
of inalienable roots (i.e. RtINAL, which select null marking when possessed, see 4.1.1),
including a few verb roots, whereas -ru2 occurs with the set of mixed possessed roots (i.e.
RtMIX, which select the -re2 mixed possessed marker when possessed, see 4.1.3). The
word formation rule provided in (74) to account for the possession markers can now be
revised to express also the suffixation of the unpossessed markers, as represented in (81):

patterns; (81b) states that a subset of these roots will follow the inalienable
morphological marking pattern which, as stated in (81b’) is that where the root is marked
by the unpossessed marker –txi in noun stems that are unpossessed and where the root is
unmarked in noun stems that are possessed; (81c) lists the three subtypes of roots which
follow the alienable morphological marking pattern which, as stated in (81c’), will
consist of the suffixation of one of the three possessed markers –te, -ne or –re1
(depending on which marker is selected by the root) when the noun stem occurs
possessed, and of no overt morphological marking (i.e. Ø) when the noun stem is
unpossessed; (81d) states that another subset of roots will follow the mixed (doublemarked) morphological marking pattern where, as stated in (81d’), such roots will be
suffixed by the unpossessed marker –ru2 when the noun stem occurs unpossessed, and by
the possessed marker –re2 when the noun stem occurs possessed.:4.4.4 Instrumental/Object Nominalizer: -iko
-iko attaches to transitive or intransitive verbs to derive ‘things to V with’ or
‘things to V’, thus as an instrumental or object nominalizer, as illustrated in (82):
24082a. katso-na-ka1-rewa-t-iko

1SG give-NMLZ‘my giftc. kusaka-rewa-t-iko
pu-muna
dig-INTR-VBLZ-NMLZ 2SG-bring‘Bring the “digger”’Notice that, as the examples in (82a) and (82c) indicate, -iko can attach to verb forms that
are themselves inflected. When this happens, the verbal formatives that occur within the
nominalized form have their meaning and function canceled out —a property which is not
exclusive of -iko, as will be seen further below. Differently from other derived forms
presented later, there is no question, however, that V-iko forms are nouns rather than verbs
morphologically, as they can take inherent noun morphology such as, e.g., the plural
marker nu-ru (described later under 4.5.3), as in suk-iko-nu-ru ‘diggers’. -iko has low
productivity in the language insofar as it occurs with very few of the nouns it could
logically occur with. The word formation rule for instrumental derivation is then as in
(83):
83. NSt → V + iko
Moreover, as the examples in (82) indicate, neither alienability nor inalienability
are grammatically encoded as part of noun stems taking -iko. That is, V-iko forms do
NOT require any alienability or inalienability formal marking device, as can be seen by
contrasting (82a,c) to (82b), where in (82a,c) the V-iko is not possessed while in (82c) it
is.","[267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272]"
"591semantic role of its subject is converted into undergoer. The third column (and subcolumns under Polarity & Number) lists the morphemes that may mark cumulatively both
polarity and number. Finally, the fourth column (and sub-columns under Gender) lists
the morphemes for masculine and feminine. Notice also that, as is made explicit in the
table below, the major distinctions in the types of ClRELs can be described in terms of
distinctions of GRs & Voice, Polarity & Number, and Gender, thus producing tripartite
morphemic clusters. That is, at the same time that relative pronominal markers are
segmentable into three morphological markers (GRs & Voice, Polarity & Number, and
Gender), they also cluster together to function as relativizers.

generally mark ClRELs, they are found to be somewhat comparable to the relative
pronouns commonly found in European languages (Keenan 1985:149-152, Comrie
1989: 149-150, Givón 1990:656-658). Similar to relative pronouns, relative pronominal
markers in Apurinã occur inside the ClREL indicating the role of the headREL, and
functioning as subordinators. So, for example, the pairs -k-a-r-u/r-o vs. -k-u-t-u/t-o, in
Apurinã, and who vs. whom, in English, are both relative pronominal forms that occur
inside the ClREL, marking the headREL as subject and object respectively. The differences592between these two pairs are in their phonological status (as bound vs. free forms), in the
number of functional properties they encode (i.e. grammatical relation, voice, polarity,
number and gender in Apurinã vs. grammatical relation and animacy in English), in their
position inside the ClREL (i.e. following the verb in Apurinã vs. initial in the ClREL in
English), and, finally, in that only the Apurinã forms can also mark headless ClRELs.
Relative pronominal markers can also be compared with nominalizers, as the following
discussion shows.
9.1.1.6The Syntactic Category of the “Verb-REL” in Relative Clauses: Verbalor Nominal?
One final issue about ClRELs is with respect to the syntactic status of the verb of
the ClRELs as a result of taking the relative pronominal markers. (VREL is used hereafter
to refer to the verb of a ClREL.) In the description of the noun morphology in chapter 4,
relative pronominal markers are listed as relativizing nominalizers under 4.4.6. Since to
refer to the tripartite morphemic clusters marking the predicate of VRELs as both
nominalizers and pronominal forms suggests a misapplication of typical derivational-like
versus typical inflectional-like properties, some clarification is in order.
It is certainly possible for a language to make use of nominalizations to mark
ClRELs (Givón 1990:663-666)5. In Apurinã there are two major pieces of evidence that
the VRELs marked with the tripartite morphemic clusters listed in the table above are
nominalized forms: one morphological and the other syntactic. In the discussion that
follows, to say that VREL is “nominal” (or “deverbal”) or “verbal” means that VREL can5Where examples from Turkish, Ute and Lhasa Tibetan are cited.","[622, 623, 624]"

head.of-UNPOSS go-PFTV
‘The head person left.’ (In this case ‘head’ refers to a mythological personage who only
exists as a head, with no other body parts.)
In (4), as everywhere else in this work, inalienable nouns are glossed as ‘N of’,
where “N” is the lexical meaning of the inalienable noun in question and “of” marks it as
obligatorily possessed. Thus, in the analysis proposed here, obligatory possession is part
of the lexical entry of inalienable nouns; that is, it is stored with the lexical entries of
inalienable nouns, rather than added by morphosyntactic rules. As seen (4a), no
morphological marker is added when an inalienable noun occurs possessed, and, as a
consequence, the syntactic context in which inalienable nouns occur possessed is one
where two nouns are placed together by juxtaposition. On the other hand, when
inalienable nouns occur unpossessed they require the presence of the unpossession
marker -txi:
The example given in (4) may suggest that possession constructions such as
[kema kuwu] can be described purely in terms of the syntactic structure internal to the
nominal phrase. In this case, the possession relation would not be marked by any lexical
property of the possessed noun but, instead, by a syntactic distribution in which the
possessor would always precede the possessed noun. However, while this “precedence
rule” is a necessary part of the grammar of possession constructions in the language, it is
not sufficient to describe them. The reason is a twofold one: First, it is necessary to refer
to the lexical property of inalienable nouns in order to describe which ones take the
unpossessed suffix -txi; second, it is necessary to refer to their lexical property also in
order to explain why they do not take the possessed suffixes described below for
alienable nouns.
153The general possessed and unpossessed morphological marking pattern is given in
Table 1. RtINAL belongs to the set of roots that are lexically marked as possessed, thus
requiring no morphological marking to occur possessed, and that require the -txi suffix to
occur unpossessed —where semantically/pragmatically possible. Put in a different way,
inalienable nouns would be covertly marked for possession (covert possession is
represented by “Ø” in Table 1) and overtly marked for unpossession. In the last column
of Table 1, as in other tables below, “NA” (not applicable) is used to mark the cases
where semantics or pragmatics does not allow a RtINAL to be realized as an unpossessed
noun:
Table 1: Marking Patterns for Inalienable Nouns
Root ClassPossessed MarkingUnpossessed MarkingRtINAL-Ø-txi/NAThus, the simplest word formation rule for these nouns is as follows:
5. NINAL → RtINAL (+ txi)
As the next subsections will illustrate, the class of simple inalienable nouns
include body parts, plant parts, personal belongs, kinship terms, among others, and
although it must constitute a closed subclass of nouns it still includes at least a few
hundred words. Based on whether they can be used with classificatory functions or not,
inalienable nouns can be further subcategorized as non-classificatory or classificatory
nouns. The morphological properties of both non-classificatory and classificatory nouns
are described next.
1544.1.1.1 Simple Inalienable Non-Classificatory Nouns
(Simple inalienable) non-classificatory nouns are simple inalienable common
nouns. An example of non-classificatory noun is kuwu ‘head of’, illustrated in (4). These
nouns follow the (un)possessed marking pattern given in Table 2, where RtINAL.NON-CL
belongs to the subset of inalienable roots (i.e. RtINAL) that cannot be used with the
classificatory function:

FunctionRtINAL.NON-CL-Ø-txi/NANOThe simplest word formation rule for these nouns is as follows:

Lists of RtINALs are given in Tables 3-6. As the data below suggest, the majority of
RtINALs that -txi attaches to refer to body parts or body-related meanings, second to
personal belongings and abstract (non-tactile) concepts, and, third, to other types of
concepts:155Table 3: The Unpossessed Nouns Marked with -txi: Body Parts

‘He killed you (pl).’The same pronominal markers are used for the subject regardless of the
transitivity of the verb (as shown in chapter 5, under 5.1.1), semantic or pragmatic roles
of the subject NP. What would appear to constitute an exception are the objective
descriptive intransitive verbs, described in the chapter 5, in 5.1.1.1.2.2. If it could be
shown that these verbs have different semantic properties from standard intransitive
verbs, one could argue that pronominal subject markers are co-referential with arguments
other than the single argument of verbs with the semantics of object descriptive verbs and
other than the “patient”-like argument of transitive verbs. However, as was shown in the
previous chapter (in subsection 5.1.1.1.2.2), although the class of descriptive verbs shows
some semantic correlates, it cannot be reduced to a specifiable semantic class of verbs
and, as such, can be more generally characterized as a grammatically (as opposed to
semantically) motivated subclass of intransitive verbs, although one that strongly
correlates with property-referring concepts. That is, the fact that object descriptive verbs
475take object rather than subject as their single argument cannot be motivated on purely
semantic grounds, thus constituting no exception to the claim that the pronominal subject
markers are co-referential with grammatical rather than semantic relations, namely with
the grammatical subject. As a consequence, subject pronominal markers are a reliable
criterion that can be used for the identification of grammatical subjects in Apurinã,
although not all grammatical subjects in other languages will translate as grammatical
subjects in Apurinã.
8.3.1.2Object
The pronominal marking system can be used to distinguish the object from thesubject. As seen in various examples of previous chapters (e.g. 7.1.1, 7.1.12, and in
Tables 6-7 in section 7.3), the pronominal marking system includes a set of (bound)
object markers that is distinct from the set of (bound) subject pronominal markers. This
object pronominal marking is further illustrated in (50), where, e.g. in (50a), the
pronominal form that is suffixed to the verb, i.e. –i, is co-referential with the post-verbal
independent pronoun for second person singular, pite, expressing the undergoer argument
of the verb. The other examples below illustrate the same for the other grammatical
persons of the object paradigm (where underlining marks coreference):

As was shown in (47), the subject can also be an undergoer argument of a verb,
which by itself already suggests that a core grammatical relation encoding an undergoer
argument is not an exclusive property of the object, and, by extension, that grammatical
relations cannot be equated with semantic roles. This is confirmed by the examples in
(50) where verbs expressing from the least to the most “patient”-like meanings all take
the object marking paradigm coreferential with the independent pronominal forms.
Furthermore, to the extent that the single argument of (intransitive) descriptive verbs can
be accompanied by a coreferential object (rather than subject) markers (as was shown, for
example, in chapter 5, in 5.1.1.1.2.2) justifies treating the syntactic expression of such
arguments as bearing object (rather than subject) grammatical relation. So, the single
arguments of each of the simplex sentences illustrated in (51) (repeated from 12 in
4775.1.1.1.2.2) are all coreferential with object pronominal markers in the verb and, as such
bear object relation in these sentences:

be.black-3M.O clothes-UNPOSS
‘The clothes are black.’
d. mita-ru
aiko
be.big-3M.O house
‘The house is big.’
Also, as was briefly mentioned in chapter 7 (7.1.1.2.2), the (bound) object
pronominal markers can sometimes be coreferential with the undergoer and sometimes
with the goal argument of verbs that can optionally take a third argument (where “goal”
also functions as a macrorole semantically in that it includes “recipient” and “goal”
semantic roles, and which is properly described in 9.1.2.4). This is precisely what is
demonstrated in (52) (as highlighted by underlining). In (52a), the third person feminine
object pronominal marker -ru is coreferential with the goal NPobl, uwa-mokaru ‘to him’,
whereas in (52b), the third person feminine object pronominal marker is coreferential
with the undergoer NP, nu-serepi ‘my arrow’:

1SG give-3F.O
3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘I gave the arrow to him.’
The fact that either a NPobl or a NP can be coded in the verb through the
coreferential object pronominal marker (i.e., -ro (52)) indicates that the object of a
(potentially) ditransitive verb can be expressed either as a NP or as a NPobl. Moreover,
the only non-subject argument whose (morpho)syntactic expression is obligatory in a
clause with a ditransitive verb is the goal argument. So, in a clause such as (53a) the only
obligatory non-subject argument is suto ‘woman’, rather than kinharu ‘“buriti” fruit’:10
UNDERGOER s-V-o.goal GOAL
53a. kinharu
u-suka-ro
suto
buriti
3F-give-3F.O woman(F)
‘He gave the woman “buriti” fruit.’
s-V-o.goal GOAL
b. u-suka-ro
suto
3F-give-3F.O woman(F)
‘He gave (it) to the woman.’
Since the object has been defined over the object pronominal markers, it follows
that NPobl that are coreferential with an object pronominal marker bear an object
relationship with the verb. However, object has also been classified above as a core
grammatical relation, that is, one that is required by the lexical meaning of the verb and,
as a result, obligatorily expressed (morpho)syntactically in a clause having such a verb.
Hence, since the only non-subject argument required in a clause with a ditransitive verb
is the goal argument, it would be logical to conclude that only the (morpho)syntactic10I have found more recently that this is not true of all dialects, since in some of them the example in (53b) is479expression of the goal argument should be considered the object of clauses with
ditransitive verbs. So, in an example such as (52b), where it is the undergoer NP
nu-serepi ‘my arrow.of’ that is coreferential with the pronominal marker in the verb (not
the goal NPobl uwa-mokaru ‘to him’), the question arises as to which element is the object
of the verb, the goal NPobl or the undergoer NP. I will maintain that the element that is
coreferential with the pronominal marker in the verb is the object in the cause, thus
postulating that object pronominal marking is the primary definitional property of
grammatical objects. That is, in (52b), uwa-mokaru is the object in the clause. This
question, however, about which element is the object of the verb only appears to arise in
elicited data, as there is no instance of natural spontaneous data where the undergoer
argument is expressed as a free syntactic expression that is coreferential with a
pronominal object marker in the verb. In natural texts, only the goal arguments co-occur
with such a pronominal marker. Instances of both goal and undergoer arguments cooccurring pre-verbally (thus, with no accompanying coreferential marker) is even less
natural and, perhaps, an artifact of the method by which the data are collected, i.e.
through elicitation.
On the face of the fact the syntactic expression of the goal argument can behave
(for the purpose of coreference with the object marker in the verb) similarly to the
syntactic expression of the undergoer argument in some clauses, but differently in others,
one may be led to describe the former situations (i.e. goal behaving the same way as
undergoer) as constituting instances of promotions of non-objects into objects. Although
such an analysis has been suggested for other languages in the past (e.g., Givón’sambiguous, being interpretable as ‘He gave the woman (to somebody)’ or ‘He gave something to the woman.’4801994:233-234 analysis of a piece of data from Machiguenga, another Maipuran
language), it would appear to be equally plausible to describe the marking syncretism
attested for goal and undergoer marking in Apurinã as simply following from what
defines object in Apurinã. In this case, the different ways in which objects are marked in
languages like Apurinã would follow from the same principles that motivate the different
mappings between semantic roles and the grammatical subject in various languages (see
Dryer 1986). In sum, the object in a potentially ditransitive clause in this language will
be the free expression of the non-subject argument that is coreferential with the object
marker in the verb; the third non-subject argument in the clause will be described as an
oblique, regardless of whether it is an undergoer or recipient.
8.3.1.3Remarks on Subject/Object and the Co-referential Pronominal MarkingPatterns
The coreferential marking patterns associated with the subject and object
pronominal markers and the arguments of the verb can be described as involving a type
of Split-S Intransitivity, where the single argument of descriptive (intransitive) verbs is
marked in the same way as the object of transitive verbs, and differently from the single
argument of (standard) intransitive verbs. Following the notation used by Dryer (To
Appear), the grouping of arguments into what is the grammatical subject in Apurinã can
be represented as follows: (Where ‘S’ = the single argument of an intransitive verb, ‘A’ =
more “agent”-like argument of a transitive verb, and ‘P’ = more “patient”-like argument)48154.","[505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513]"
"3.4. Parts-of-Speech System
The system of parts of speech consists of the classes of words found in the language,
where ‘word’ is the grammatical (rather than phonological) notion described above.
Throughout this and the next chapters ‘word’ will be used to mean grammatical word. In
the presentation that follows I draw a distinction between open and closed classes of words133(Schachter 1985, Fabb 1994:60). Open word classes include the words that belong to a large
category where, in principle, new members can be easily added. Closed word classes
(whose morphology is described in chapter 5) include the words that are part of a limited set
wherein, in principle, new members are much more difficult to add. So, in Apurinã words
such as pãko-ta ‘stool-round.edge’ and paraka ‘hut’ are instances of words of the open class
that were borrowed into the language, the first from the Portuguese word banco ‘stool,
bench’, and the second from the word barraca ‘hut’, also from Portuguese. In contrast to
the fact that there are clear instances of loanwords of the open class introduced in Apurinã,
there is absolutely no instance of any loanword of the closed class.
This division of words into open or closed classes may not work very well when
subclasses of nouns and verbs are compared to closed word classes. Some of the subclasses
of nouns and verbs form a restricted set in a way rather similar to closed word classes.
Nevertheless, when the super-ordinate class noun and the super-ordinate class verb are
compared to closed word classes, the distinction is maintained. Although the distinction
between closed and open word classes approximates that between lexical/content and
grammatical/functional words, the former distinction is the one used because there the
criteria for membership is (in my understanding) more straightforward.","[164, 165]"
"8.5.1 Valence-Increasing Operations
In the following subsection the causative markers used in operations that result in
increased valence are first described.
8.5.1.1Causatives
As seen in 5.2.1.1.1.2, 5.2.1.1.1.5 and 5.2.1.2.1.4, there are three forms ofmorphological causatives in the language. The first causativizer is the class1 bound
verbal form -kũtaka, used with transitive verbs, and described in 5.2.1.1.1.5 above. -kũ
taka is illustrated in clausal context in (79a), where it attaches to the transitive verb nhika
‘to eat’; p-ita-ru ‘2SG-cousin.of-M’ refers to the one caused to do something (i.e. the
causee); yapa ‘“capibara”’ is what was caused to be eaten; and the subject marker arefers to the one who causes the causee to do something (i.e. the causer). nhika is a
bivalent verb, but in this example it works as a trivalent one as a result of the presence of
the causativizer: (In these and in other examples below, underlining is used just to
505highlight the causativizer, whereas double underlining indicates coreference between
double-underlined forms.)

‘Let’s make him eat “capybara”.’
The example in (79b) illustrates the fact that, in causative constructions, the
causee can be marked in the verb as the object marker. Thus, the NP-causee bears the
subject whereas the NP-causer bears the object grammatical relations. The question left
unanswered is what the grammatical relation of ‘what is caused to be V-ed’ is. In other
words: What is the grammatical relation of yapa in (79)? One possible analysis of this
third argument of causative constructions is to treat it as bearing an oblique grammatical
relation. The problem, however, of treating arguments such as yapa in (79) as an oblique
is that this argument is not structurally optional in the clause in the same way as other
obliques are in the language. Another possible analysis is to treat it as a secondary object
that is restricted to causative constructions. The problem with this second analysis is that
there is no independent evidence to treat such an argument as an object. The notion of a
grammatical object was defined for Apurinã over the possibility of a free expression cooccur with a coreferential object marker in the verb. As was shown in (79), the object
marker in the verb of causative constructions is coreferential with the causee and not with
‘what is caused to be V-ed’. Hence, either analyses have problems. In order to avoid
positing an ill motivated solution to this problem, I will choose to leave undetermined
506what the grammatical relation of ‘what is caused to be V-ed’ is in a causative
construction. I suspect that further research on the intrinsic properties of objects and
obliques in Apurinã will reveal ways that will help to resolve the issue.
The second and third causativizers have the same phonological form, -ka, and the
same function, occurring with both transitive and intransitive verbs. They only differ in
their affix position within the verb: One belongs to class1 bound verbal forms
(5.2.1.1.1.3) whereas the other belongs to class2 bound forms (5.2.1.2.1.4). In the
example in (80a) n- is the causer and amarunu ‘boy’ is the causee; in (80b) (repeated
from chapter 5), nhi- is the causer, -ru the causee, and yapa the object. In the first case a
monovalent verb is made bivalent, and in the second case a bivalent verb is made
trivalent:
O.CAUSEE s.causer-V
80a. amarunu
n-umaka-ka2-nanu-ta
boy
1SG-sleep-CAUS-PROG-VBLZ
‘I am making the kid sleep.’
causer-V-o.causee
O.CAUSEE
b. nhi-nhika-ka3-ru
yapa
1SG-eat-CAUS-3M.O capybara
‘I made him eat capybara.’
That the causee of an intransitive verb behaves as a grammatical object is shown
by the next example in (81). In this example the causee is anãpa ‘dog’ and it co-occurs
with a coreferential object pronominal marker, i.e. -ru ‘3M.O’, in the verb:
S.CAUSER V-CAUS-o.causee
O.CAUSEE
81. kuku
muteka-ka3-pe-ru
anãpa
boy
run-CAUS-PFTV-3M.O dog
‘The man made the dog run.’507Notice also that, as can be seen by comparing (80a) and (80b), the causer maps
onto subject regardless of whether the verb is transitive or intransitive. On the other
hand, as can be seen by comparing (80b) and (81), the causee is mapped onto the object
regardless of whether the verb is transitive or intransitive.
Presently, aside from the transitivity distinction there is no evidence that other
grammatical properties play a role in the decision to use one or the other of the
causativizers. This may suggest that any such a distinction, instead, comes from subtle
semantic or discourse-pragmatic properties that are not grammaticalized in the language
—and which still need to be determined. So far I have not been able to find any
grammatical or discourse-pragmatic factor that can be used to distinguish the use of -ka2
versus -ka3. The co-occurrence of -ka2 and -ka3 in the same verb base does not occur in
natural speech. Only very collaborative speakers can sometimes accept the use of two
causativizers in the same verb base. Finally, notice that, as demonstrated by (80a) when
compared to (82), whereas the causer is always the subject (since the causer can be
coreferential with or expressed as the subject pronominal marker), never the object, the
causee is always the object (since the causee can coreferential or expressed as the object
pronominal marker), never the subject:
S.CAUSEE
V-causer.o
82. *amarunu umaka-ka-nanu-ta-no
boy
eat-CAUS-PROG-VBLZ-1SG.O
(I am making the kid sleep.)
Thus, the mapping between causer and causee and the grammatical relations borne by
their syntactic expressions further confirms the subject-object distinction, insofar as the508former always maps onto the grammatical subject whereas the latter always maps onto
the grammatical object.","[536, 537, 538, 539, 540]"

This appendix summarizes the results of a partial comparison between Apurinã, Piro and Iñapari,
presenting preliminary reconstruction of the segmental inventory for P(roto-)A(purinã-)P(iro-)I(ñapari).
The current results are still preliminary, since the reconstruction did not include morphological or syntactic
properties, and nasalization, vowel lengthening and supragments (i.e. stress and tone) are not considered in
this preliminary reconstruction.1
The data from Apurinã are, obviusly, derived from my own research and visits to the field. The data
from Piro come from Matteson (1965 and 1972b). The data from Iñapari come from Parker (1995). The
clustering of Apurinã, Piro and Iñapari as the members of a branch of Arawak has already been suggested
by a classification given in Payne (1991:364), the successful reconstruction presented here will, however,
need to be verified in contrast to other subgroups of Arawak in search of shared innovations. The fact that
a successful (though preliminary) reconstruction of P-API will be arrived at here does not exclude the
possibility that further research may show that other languages (in addition to Apurinã, Piro and Iñapari)
should form a single subgroup within Arawak; rather, it means that a specific subgroup will have been
determined to which other language(s) may or may not be added pending further research. Furthermore,
there is no need to worry about whether API are all Arawak languages, since this has already been
demonstrated by previous comparative works (see Valenzuela 1991, Payne 1991 and Aikhenvald 1999).
The terminology used is this section is primarily based on Campbell 1999:111-112.
327 words were examined, including body parts, kinship terms, various animal and plant names,
descriptive and grammatical words, among others. There were a total of 122 cognate sets shared by API,
56 shared by Apurinã and Piro (but not by Iñapari), 28 shared only by Apurinã and Iñapari (but not by658Piro), and 12 shared by Piro and Iñapari (but not by Apurinã). The 122 cognate sets represent 39% of
shared lexical (i.e. vocabulary) retention in API. Although such a vocabulary similarity confirms earlier
suspicion that API are closely related and may descend from a proto-language, i.e. API, as part of an
intermediary branch of Arawak, shared lexical similarities alone cannot be used to show how closely
related to one another these three languages are, nor can they be used to prove that API indeed form a
subgroup of Arawak. Table 1 (where Ø marks the cases where the reflex of the proto-sound is
phonologically null, i.e. absent, in the vocabulary item in question) gives only a partial list of the cognate
sets illustrating the most obvious sound correspondences that were used to reconstruct a preliminary
segmental inventory for P-API. From left to right, the first column of Table 1 provides the English gloss of
the cognate sets given in the second, third and fourth columns for Apurinã, Piro and Iñapari, respectively;
whereas the fifth column gives the reconstructed proto-sounds for P-API. These reconstructed forms are
easily arrived at when their reflexes remain the same in all the sister languages, as shown by most of the
sound correspondences given in the table above. So, for example, in the cognate set pekiri:pexØri:pehiri
‘agouti’, since the word initial sound p remains constant in the same environment across the three items
being compared, *p can be posited as the ancient (proto-sound) which the reflexes p:p:p descend from. In
other cases, however, a number of sound changes needs to be posited in order to determine which protosound will be reconstructed. For example, in the cognate set koti:koti:Øotí ‘rat’, the word initial phoneme
k is found both in Apurinã and in Piro, respectively, but the same phoneme is absent in the word initial
position in Iñapari in pretty much the same environment (where the absence of the phoneme is represented
by Ø). Since the odds are that it is more likely that one language alone changed, while the other two did
not, rather than the reverse (there being no evidence to the contrary), and since the dropping of a consonant
is quite common as a historical phonological process (i.e. more common than the addition of it) across
languages, we can posit that in the correspondence set k:k:Ø, *k was originally found in P-API, and that
this original sound was preserved in Apurinã and in Piro, but *k was dropped in word initial environment in
Iñapari. In fact, to give a more complete picture, *k was preserved (as k) in all environments in Apurinã (as1The content of this appendix is presented with a slightly different wording in Facundes 2000.","[673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690]"

So, this property that nouns (such as the underlined ones given in (28)) have of
determining the inflecting properties of other elements inside the same phrasal
construction or clause can be taken to be one of the defining properties of a head of a NP.
The second is that various of the examples above also show that a noun (or pronoun) can
be the only element within a bare NP. The control of inflecting properties, then, can be
used to motivate the category head of a NP, and nouns and independent pronouns are the
elements that can head a NP. Hence, following the “head rule as internal structure test
for phrase class” given in (15), the presence of a noun or pronoun head constitutes a
positive evidence of a NP. Also, following the “internal structure test for phrase class”
given in (13), the presence of a numeral or demonstrative (as elements internal to NPs)
will count as positive evidence of NPs —insofar as wherever one finds a demonstrative
or a numeral, one will also find a NP.
In contrast to languages that require a determiner in order for the noun to function
as the syntactic expression of a verbal argument, in Apurinã nouns can stand by
themselves (without any determiner) as the sole nominal expression of a subject or an
object. In the following examples hãtako-ro ‘youth-F’, and ximaku ‘fish’ are instances of
nouns that can stand by themselves as the nominal expression of notional subject and
object, respectively:45629a. o-su-pe
hãtako-ro
3F-go-PFTV youth-F
‘The girl left.’
b. hãtako-ro nhika-ru ximaku
youth-F
eat-3M.O fish
‘The girl ate fish.’
c. ximaku o-muna hãtako-ro
fish
3F-bring youth-F
The girl brought fish.’
There are some preliminary indications that in some Apurinã speech varieties the
demonstrative forms constitute a subclass of independent pronouns, insofar as they can
stand by themselves as a noun phrase. If further investigation confirms the existence of
pronominal demonstratives in those speech varieties, the NP structure will need to be
revised accordingly for those speech varieties, since in such cases demonstratives would
constitute instances of pronouns.
One final note about subject/object/possessor NPs is that, as was shown in 7.3,
pronominal markers are in complementary distribution with pre-verbal (but NOT postverbal) coreferential subject/object (pro)nominals and with any coreferential possessor
(pro)nominal. Now that NPs have been introduced, this complementary distribution can
be thought of as involving subject/object/possessor NPs and coreferential person markers.
The examples in (30) further illustrate this complementary distribution:
30a. o-apo-pe
3F-arrive-PFTV
‘She has already arrived.’
b. *[owa]NP o-apo-pe
3SG.F 3F-arrive-PFTV
(She has already arrived.)457c. *owa o-unuro
apo-pe 3
3SG.F 3F-mother.of arrive-PFTV
(Her mother has already arrived.)
d. *o-unuro
owa
apo-pe
3F-mother.of 3SG.F arrive-PFTV
(Her mother has already arrived.)
In (30a) this form o- ‘3F’ can stand by itself as the sole formal expression of an
argument of the verb; (30b) shows that this same pronominal marker is in complementary
distribution with the coreferential independent pronominal subject; (30c) shows that the
pronominal marker is in complementary distribution with the pre-nominal possessor; and,
in (30d) the pronominal marker is shown to be also in complementary distribution with
the postnominal possessor. Insofar as pronominal markers can replace pre-verbal
coreferential nouns or independent pronouns, they behave like NPs. However, they are
NOT in complementary distribution (i.e. they can co-occur) with post-verbal NPs, as
shown by (28) and various of the previous examples. The complementary distribution
involving pronominal markers and a subset of coreferential NPs (i.e. subject, object and
possessor NPs) under the circumstances just described is relevant for the identification of
NPs insofar as it can be used to identify one important subset of NPs in the language.
8.1.1.2Oblique Noun Phrases
Oblique noun phrases (hereafter NPobl) consist of nominal forms that aremarked with one of the oblique markers which were morphologically described in
chapter 7, in 7.1.2, and whose syntactic function of the (pro)nominal expressions where3This sentence, however, could be grammatical if interpreted as ‘Her mother, she has left.’458they occur will be discussed in 8.3.2. Oblique markers are the bound forms that attach to
a (pro)noun to form a NPobl, as the examples in (31) illustrate:
31a. n-awa-ru
wai [[nota tanu-ro
nurumane]NP -kata]NPobl
1SG-exist-3M.O here
1SG spouse.of-F relative-ASSOC
‘I live here with the relatives of my wife.’
b. p-ita-ru
su-pe
[[ata nurumane awapoko]NP -mokaru]NPobl
2SG-brother.of-M go-PFTV 1PL relative
village-GOAL
‘Your brother has gone to the village of our people.’
As can be gathered from the two examples in (31), although the morphological “host” of
the oblique marker is always the last word of a NPobl, its semantic scope is the whole
NPobl within which it occurs, not the word base it is phonologically attached to. The
ungrammatical examples in (32) are given to demonstrate the fact that oblique markers
cannot attach to elements within a NPobl other than the rightmost one:
32a. *n-awa-ru
wai nota tanu-ro1-kata
nurumane
1SG-exist-3M.O here 1SG spouse.of-F-ASSOC relative
(I live here with the relatives of my wife.)
b. *n-awa-ru
wai
nota-kata
tanu-ro1
nurumane
1SG-exist-3M.O here 1SG-ASSOC spouse.of-F relative.of
(I live here with the relatives of my wife.)
The examples in (33) show that a NPobl passes both the movement and
replacement tests for constituency. If we compare (33a) to (31a) we can see that the
NPobl can move as a unit; and if we compare (33b) to (31b) we can see that a NPobl can be
replaced by a single word, where both clauses (with and without replacement) have
related meanings in that they can refer to the same location/goal:45933a. [[nota tanu-ro
nurumane]NP -kata]NPobl n-awa-ru
wai
1SG spouse.of-F relative-ASSOC
1SG-exist-3M.O here
‘I live here with the relatives of my wife.’
b. p-ita-ru
su-pe
[werã]
2SG-brother-M go-PFTV there
‘Your brother has gone there.’
A valid question about what is being treated here as NPobls regards the extent to
which they are different from NPs and, moreover, whether such differences would justify
creating a new phrasal category rather than simply positing a new NP subcategory. In
terms of the structural definition given in the previous subsection for NPs, one could
argue that the following examples in (34) present a piece of evidence for not treating the
putative NPobls as NPs, where in (34b) a pronoun cannot replace the NPobl given in (34a):
34a. nota apo-pe
[mipa-kata]
1SG arrive-PFTV Mipa-ASSOC
‘I came with Mipa.’
b. *nota apo-pe
[uwa]
1SG arrive-PFTV 3SG.M
For all NPs seen so far it is the case that they can be replaced with an independent
coreferential pronoun. Thus, what is relevant in (34) is precisely the fact that, as shown
by (34b), NPobls cannot be replaced by a coreferential independent pronoun. However,
the ungrammaticality of (34b) follows directy from the semantics that the oblique marker
-kata adds to the NPobl mipa-kata, rather than necessarily from any structural distinction
between caseless and oblique noun phrases. That is, the distinction between NPs and
NPobls can be described solely in terms of their distribution in the clause that follows
from the grammatical relations they bear. So, as an associative oblique grammatical460relation (described in detail in 8.3.2.3), mipa-kata can only be replaced by a semantically
compatible “pro-form”, as illustrated in (35):
35a. nota apo-pe
[uwa-kata]
1SG arrive-PFTV 3SG.M-ASSOC
‘I came with him.’
Another possible argument for distinguishing NPobls from NPs in Apurinã follows
from its internal structure. As was seen in the previous section and summarized in (27), a
NP can precede a possessed noun. In (36) it is shown that NPobls cannot occur with a
possessed noun:
36. *nu-suka-ru
uwa
[nota hãke-ru-monhi] suto-re
1SG-give-3O.M 3SG.M 1SG child-M-GOAL woman-POSSED
(I gave it to the wife of my son.)
In (36), again the distinction can be argued to follow from the semantics of possession
construction rather then from any structural syntactic property of NPobls.
In sum, aside from always taking an oblique marker, NPobls also differ from NPs
in that they cannot be replaced by a coreferential independent pronoun, and in that they
cannot function as possessor. However, a different interpretation of the evidence
presented so far for distinguishing NPobls from NPs is that they follow from the semantic
roles denoted by NPobls, rather than from any major structural syntactic distinctions they
might have. In fact, the extent to which no crucial grammatical property is revealed by
how the distinctions between NPobls and NPs are categorized by itself suggests that this
may be ultimately a terminological issue. For the purpose of this work, I will continue to
treat NPobls as a subtype of noun phrases in Apurinã. Furthermore, as will be seen in the461description of grammatical relations in 8.3, there is a strong correlation between each
individual type of NPobl and the semantic roles they denote.","[486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493]"
"4.4.2 Possessed Markers: -te, -ne, -re1, and -re2
The possessed markers -te, -ne, and -re1 were described above in 4.1.2 as suffixes
that occur with alienable simple nouns, whereas the possessed marker -re2 was described
in 4.1.3 as a suffix that occurs with mixed simple nouns. Under the analysis presented
earlier, the choice of possessed markers is lexically determined. In the absence of further
specification, there are two possible interpretations of what it means here for possessed
markers to be lexically determined: It will either mean that (i) possessed markers are
assigned as part of the morphological properties associated with noun stems, or that (ii)
possessed markers are assigned in the lexicon (or at a different level in the lexicon, if
morphology is conceived inside the lexicon —depending on one’s morphological theory)
so that the information determining which possessed marker a noun base will take will be
part of the lexical meaning of the noun base (and not a result of any general grammatical
rule). In terms of the traditional derivational versus inflectional opposition made for
affixes in the morphological typology, possession marking is generally treated as an
inflectional category. In any analysis of -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2, these formatives will be
more inflectional or derivational-like depending on how one analyzes their morphological
status. In the next paragraphs I will describe these two possible analyses for possessed
228markers, and then will suggest a third analysis which will turn out to be a combination of
the first two.
In the first analysis possessed marking would be implemented as morphological
rules, and the formatives -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2 would be described as partially suppletive
allomorphs. If these possessed markers are analyzed as (partially suppletive) allomorphs
of the same morpheme, then they will be more like inflectional categories in other
languages, since they would simply constitute the allomorphic realization
(i.e. -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2, as determined by the morphological class of the noun they occur
with) of the morpheme {possessed}. In this first analysis speakers/hearers are assumed
to have a notion of the more abstract morpheme {possessed}, and the work of
implementing the phonological realization of {possessed} is left for the suppletive rules.
The rules in (70) represent the implementation of this first analysis:
70a. NSt → Rt + {possessed}
te
Rt

Rtne
b. Rt → Rt 
re1
Rtre2-te

-ne
c. {possessed} → -re 
1
-re2
(70a) states that a possessed noun stem is formed of a root plus the morpheme
{possessed}. (70b) specifies that the root base to which the morpheme {possessed}
attaches belongs to one of a set of four roots (i.e. Rtte, Rtne, Rtre1, or Rtre2) —which are
lexically marked to select one of the four partially suppletive forms of the morpheme229{possessed}. Finally, (70c) further specifies that the morpheme {possessed} can be
realized as -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2 —depending on the class of the root base (i.e. Rtte, Rtne,
Rtre1, or Rtre2) such a morpheme attaches to.
The first analysis just outlined is the descriptively least troublesome analysis to
the linguist because it makes use of suppletion to explain the various forms which
possessed marking takes, therefore exempting the analyst from providing unique meaning
or function to each of the suppletive forms. Such would be the case for the following
reason: In arguing that whether the {possessed} morpheme takes the form -te, -ne, -re1
or -re2 would be purely a matter of which morphological (arbitrary) class the base taking
this {possessed} morpheme belongs to we would also be giving up any possibility of
finding a semantic, phonological or syntactic motivation for the various possessed
markers in the language. Moreover, the fact that -te, -ne, -re1 and -re2 can all be
characterized as denoting one general meaning, namely ‘possessed’, is supportive of an
allomorphic analysis under partial suppletion. Notice, however, that the result of a
suppletive analysis of possessed markers in Apurinã would differ from, for example, a
suppletive analysis of go > went, be > am, is, are etc. in English. In go > went the
suppletion is grammatically motivated, since speakers/hearers only need to associate the
“irregular” forms with the past tense. In be > am, is, are etc., suppletion is also
grammatically motivated because speakers/hearers need to associate “irregular” forms
with the tense, person and number. In Apurinã, however, suppletive forms such as -te
> -ne > -re1 > -re2 would each need to be associated with an arbitrarily defined subset of
roots.
In the second analysis of possessed marking, possessed markers would be
conceived as satisfying the subcategorization constraints of subsets of roots in the same
230way as the gender (or noun class) markers do in languages where gender is lexically
(rather than semantically or phonologically) assigned. Some roots in Apurinã would
have the possessed markers assigned to them in a way similar to how masculine/feminine
gender is assigned to noun stems that take no overt gender marker in the language —as
described in the previous subsection. That is, under this analysis, the root form ããta
‘canoe(F)’ would subcategorize both to agree with the feminine gender (as in o-ye ããta
[F-PROX canoe] ‘this canoe’) and to take the -ne possessed marker (as in nota ããta-ne
[1SG canoe-POSSED] ‘my canoe’). An informal description of the meaning of the noun
root ããta could be represented as in (71):
 'canoe' 
71. ããta ‘FEMININE’
-ne


In this second analysis, each of the possessed markers would be analyzed as
independent morphemes whose information is recorded as part of the lexical entry of the
root they attach to. Each of the four possessed markers, by definition, would have
distinctive meaning and/or functional properties, if they are to be treated as morphemes.
Moreover, if the possessed markers -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2 are analyzed as different
morphemes that certain roots subcategorize for, then they will be more like derivational
morphological categories in other languages. This would be true to the extent that the
information about the morphological markers would, conceivably, be stored as part of the
lexical entry of the roots they occur with. In sum, in this second analysis,
speakers/hearers are assumed to subcategorize roots for taking -te, -ne, -re1 or -re2; the
information about the morphological realization of each of the possessed markers is built
as part of the lexical entry of certain lexically specified roots, and the work left to do is to
231provide meaning and/or function to each of the possessed markers as separate
morphemes. (72) presents the rule stating that the possessed noun stems are realized as a
subset of roots plus the possessed morphemes such roots are lexically specified to take:
te + te
Rt

Rtne + ne
72. NSt → Rt + re 
re1
1
Rtre2 + re2The major problem with the second analysis is in motivating an independent
morphemic status for each of the possessed markers -te, -ne, -re1 and -re2. In an earlier
attempt to make sense out of the use of these possessed markers in less arbitrary ways
(see Facundes 1995) I found that very intricate arguments can be explored in constructing
an account for possessed marking. Such arguments are partially grounded on information
of how genitive classifiers are used in other languages (as described in Carlson and
Payne 1989), on cross-linguistic properties of (in)alienability (as presented in Nichols
1988), on the notion of predicativity as it extends to nominal possession (as suggested in
Seiler 1983), and on iconicity principles as expressed in a notion of conceptual distance
(as presented in Chappell and McGregor 1989). The basic idea is that if possession
marking is conceived as a formal device used in some languages to express a
combination of conceptual distance between possessor and possessee, the functional or
social role of the possessee for the possessor, and degrees of predicativity between the
possessor and the possessee (as analogous to an argument and its verb), it may be
possible to assign some meaning to each of the possessed markers in Apurinã, perhaps
enough to consider them as distinct morphemes that are related in terms of having one
general meaning, i.e. possessed, but also different in terms of the type of possession they
232encode. In this manner, possessed markers would work in ways analogous to, for
example, the various morphemes for object that also inflect for person, since such
morphemes would have the general common property of marking object and, at the same
time, they would also have different properties in that they would also refer each to a
different person. So far, however, I have not been able to provide satisfactory
independent meaning/function for each of the possessed markers in order to motivate
their morphemic status.
The third analysis to be suggested here can be summarized as follows: First, the
possessed markers, in addition to carrying the meaning ‘possessed’, also function as the
morphological forms performing the marking patterns that motivate the notions of simple
alienable nouns and of simple mixed nouns (described in 4.1.2 and 4.1.3, respectively);
second, while the possessed markers -te, -ne, and -re1 are partial suppletive allomorphs of
a single morpheme whose meaning/function is ‘[possessed, alienable]’, the possessed
marker -re2 is a morpheme (different from -te, -ne, and -re1) whose meaning/function is
‘[possessed, mixed]’; and, third, ‘possessed’ refers to the property of being possessed,
‘alienable’ refers to the property of belonging to the (un)possession marking pattern
associated with simple alienable nouns (as described in 4.1.2), and ‘mixed’ refers to the
property of belonging to the (un)possession marking pattern associated with simple
mixed nouns (as described in 4.1.3). The examples in (73) illustrate the general meaning
properties of the root forms ããta and kota-, as they can be described following an
analysis in which the (un)possession marking patterns are generalized to become the
defining properties of alienable and mixed nouns, and constructed as part of the meaning
of these root forms:233 'canoe' 
73a. ããta ‘ FEMININE ’
ALIENABLE
 'basket' 
b. kota ‘MASCULINE’
 MIXED 
In (73a), ‘canoe’ is the content meaning of the root form ããta, whereas
‘FEMININE’ and ‘ALIENABLE’ are the grammatical meanings which this root
subcategorizes for. In (73b), ‘basket’ is the content meaning of kota-, whereas
‘MASCULINE’ and ‘MIXED’ are the grammatical meanings which this root
subcategorizes for. The word formation rules involving possessed markers can be
described as in (74) —revised later in (81):
RtALIEN + ALIEN

MIXRtte 

Rtre1
-te 

-re1
c. RtMIX → Rtre2
c’. MIX → -re2
(74a) states the generalization that a possessed noun stem will either consist of a
root lexically marked as [alienable] plus an alienable possessed marker, or of a root
lexically marked as [mixed] plus the mixed possessed marker. (74b) specifies the classes
of alienable roots that take the alienable possessed marker. (74b’) lists the alienable234markers which alienable roots select for. (74c) specifies the class of mixed roots that can
take the mixed possessed marker. Finally, (74c’) lists the mixed possessed marker which
mixed roots select for. Note, however, that the word formation represented in (74) only
takes into consideration the possessed markers. Since (in)alienability and mixing
possession marking have been defined over the morphological marking patterns found
both in possession and unpossession constructions, the word formation rule given in (74)
will need to be revised to include the unpossession marking patterns. This is done in the
next subsection.
The possessed markers in Apurinã are precisely the forms that have been
reconstructed for Proto-Maipuran (David Payne 1991:378-379). That would mean that,
in principle, the Apurinã possessed markers are at least a few thousand years old. It is
possible that only historical-comparative studies within the Maipuran family will provide
clearer evidence as to whether these different possessed markers originated in classifying
systems (e.g. genitive classifiers) or whether they arose through phonological processes
that are no longer transparent in Apurinã.
As an additional observation about possessed markers, I should recall a special
property of the possessed marker -re1. As was shown under 4.1.2, possessed markers
typically occur with a noun base or a bound root base. The qualifier “typically” is used
here precisely because one of the possessed markers, namely -re1, can also attach to verb
forms to derive a possessed noun. The general property of the possessed markers -te, -ne,
and -re2, as described in detail in 4.1.2-4.1.3 in the previous paragraphs, is simply to
mark a noun form as possessed and distinguish the class of alienable from the class of
mixed (and inalienable) nouns, with no other apparent meaning added to it. The
possessed marker -re1, in contrast, aside from being attached to free roots to derive
235possessed noun forms (as amply illustrated in (50) and in Table 18), can also be added to
verbs to derive noun stems, as illustrated in (75):
75a. tokatxi xika-re1
Tokatxi sing-POSSED‘Tokatxi’s song’b. ata kama-re1
1PL work-POSSED‘our work’c. uwa
yaxirika-re1
3SG.M tie-POSSED‘its/his knot’d. nota sãpaka-re1
1SG be.tired-POSSED‘my tiredness’The function of -re1, when it occurs attached to verbs, is to derive nouns generally
meaning ‘what you get/feel by V-ing’. That is, -re1 behaves as a sort of possessed object
nominalizer whose derived forms refer to possessed activities or states. To the extent that
at least one of the possessed markers can occur with verbs to derive nouns, they behave
as subcategory changing morphemes. Since -re1 is the only possessed marker that can
occur with verbs to nominalize them, and since it is restricted to a few verbs, it is likely to
constitute an innovation within the possession marking system.","[259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"
"585However, although non-verbal ClRELs of the type illustrated in (35) can be found
both in elicited as well as in text material, it is more common (both in elicited and text
material) for clauses with non-verbal predicators to make use of the verb form inha
(briefly mentioned in 9.1.1.1, in association with ClRELs with descriptive verb
predicators). In (36a) suto is the headREL that is modified by ClREL popũka-ro
inha-karo-wa ‘who is Apurinã’. In (36b) amarunu ‘child’ is the headREL that is modified
by the ClREL suto-nhi inha-karo-wa ‘who is woman’:

woman be-REL.F.POS.S-REFL die
‘The child who was a female died.’
Lit.:‘The child who was a woman died.’
Notice that in while in (36a) the reflexive marker -wa occurs attached to the verb form,
no such a marker is found in (36b). Although the reflexive marker is often found in these
types of nominal ClRELs, its presence is structurally optional and is likely to be
conditioned by discourse-pragmatic factors which, however, remain to be determined.
As the examples in (36) show, non-verbal ClRELs are marked with the subject
relative pronominal markers plus, in some cases, the reflexive marker. Therefore, both
the strategies used for relativizing clauses with descriptive verbs and for relativizing
clauses with non-descriptive verbs can be used with clauses with non-verbal predicators.
That is, simplex sentences with non-verbal predicators can either take no formal marker
586when embedded as a ClREL in a complex sentence (as in 35), or they can make use of the
verb form inha plus the subject relative pronominal marker (as in 36). The verb form
inha is only found in ClRELs with descriptive verbs (as shown in 9.1.1.1) or non-verbal
predicators. Although inha can be described in this work as a copula verb that is
restricted to certain ClRELs, it is possible (as mentioned in 9.1.1.1) that more data will
show that some uses of it can be best described as an auxiliary verb that is restricted to a
subset of ClRELs. Finally, so far there is no evidence of any grammatical factor that may
condition the presence versus absence of inha in the ClRELs in which they can occur.
9.1.1.4Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses
Non-restrictive relative clauses are generally defined in other languages asClRELs that do not constrain the headREL, and whose headRELs are “fully specified, definite
NPs such as proper nouns” (Keenan 1985:169); as ClRELs that add information “about an
already identified entity, but not to identify that entity” (Comrie 1989:138); or, as ClRELs
encoding a “proposition [that] tends NOT to be presupposed” (Givón 1990:649). On the
basis of these definitions, we would like to then find an example of a complex clause
formed out of the combination of sentences such as the ones given in (37). In (37) both
simplex sentences have a common argument, kayãparo, which is a proper noun:
37a. kayãparo nu-suto-re
Kayãparo 1SG-woman-POSSED
‘Kayãparo is my wife.’
S
V
b. kayãparo apo-pe
Kayãparo arrive-PFTV
‘Kayãparo has arrived.’587The combination of these two simplex sentences into a complex one produces the
sentence in (38). In (38) kayãparo ‘name of a woman’ is the headREL that is modified by
the ClREL nu-suto-re inhakaro ‘who is my wife’. The headREL kayãparo, as a proper
noun, is a fully specified, identified, NP, and the information expressed by the ClREL is
not presupposed. What this example then shows is that non-restrictive ClRELs make use
of the same formal marking strategy as restrictive ClRELs; that is, both restrictive and nonrestrictive ClRELs are marked with relative pronominal markers:
S/UNDERGOER [
O
V-rel.s]
V
38. kayãparo
nu-suto-re
inha-karo
apo-pe
Kayãparo
1SG-woman-POSSED be-REL.SG.F.POS.S arrive-PFTV
‘Kayãparo, my wife, has arrived.’
Lit.: ‘Kayãparo, who’s my wife, has arrived.’
However, non-restrictive ClRELs, by definition, also allow for certain ClRELs that
are unlikely to be encoded as restrictive ClRELs. For example, aside from proper nouns,
non-restrictive ClRELs, in principle, also allow for pronouns to be relativized. In fact, in
Apurinã, the relativization of pronouns is more than a logical possibility, as the examples
in (39) illustrate. In (39a-e) all independent pronouns (with the exception of third person
singular) are “modified” by a ClREL. Although there is nothing special about the
relativization of pronouns per se, it is surprising (based on what has been shown so far) to
find that these pronouns are accompanied of a coreferential OBJECT pronominal marker
(highlighted with double underlining in 39a-c) on the verb, in addition to the relative
pronominal markers that themselves are also coreferential (in gender) with the headREL
pronouns:588S/S [ V-rel.s-o

The problem is not so much in having coreference marked twice in the same
ClREL, but that there is a conflict in what the coreference is marked for. The relative
pronominal markers -karu and -kanu are also SUBJECT markers (as shown in 9.1.1.1.2),
whereas the bound pronominal forms following the relativizers are OBJECT markers (as
shown in 5.1 and 7.1.1.2). Aside from marking object, the bound pronominal markers
found in the examples in (39) also add another parameter of coreference, namely person
marking. The following paragraphs present two partial accounts of the data in (39), in an
attempt to explain what appears to be conflicting markings for core grammatical relations
in non-restrictive ClRELs.
One first possible account of the presence of the bound pronominal markers in
non-restrictive ClRELs is that they are also “present” in restrictive ClRELs, and that it
589simply happens that restrictive ClRELs by definition modify headRELs in third person. In
this account the assumption is that the marker for third person in ClRELs is not audible
phonologically (or, in other words, is not morphologically marked). One potential
problem with this account is that not only the marker for third person but also the one for
second person plural will be not audible phonologically (or is not morphologically
marked) —a potential but not critical problem. On this account, restrictive and nonrestrictive ClRELs are NOT distinguishable syntactically. The following example in (40),
where the headREL is a third person independent pronoun, supports this first account. In
this example, a non-restrictive ClREL “modifies” an identifiable NP, and there is no formal
difference between this non-restrictive ClREL and the comparable restrictive ClRELs seen
so far:

okatsããta-karo kona nhika-ika-ru
ximaku
3SG.F fish-REL.SG.F.S not eat-ANYMORE-3M.O fish
‘She, who did fishing, did not eat fish anymore.’
Another possible account of the data in (39) is that person markers are restricted
to non-restrictive ClRELs, and the morphological distinction between the two follows from
the semantics and discourse-pragmatics inherent to both types of relative clauses. Even
in this second account, however, restrictive and non-restrictive ClRELs can be considered
as non-distinguishable syntactically, since their only formal marking distinction follows
from non-syntactic properties they have. This second account would work in the same
way as the first one, except that there would be no null morpheme for third person in
restrictive relatives clauses. So, in (40), third person would be null or unmarked in the
verb.
590Either of the accounts in the foregoing discussion provides a motivation to find
the person markers in the data in (39). What these accounts, nonetheless, do not explain
is why such person markers mark object rather than subject, if the latter is what is marked
in the relative pronominal markers. This latter question is dealt with in the next section.
To finalize the discussion on non-restrictive ClRELs, I should add that, as far as I
have been able to observe, no evidence of a pause preceding and/or following nonrestrictive ClRELs has been detected so far. Nonetheless, it would not surprise me to find
Apurinã speakers with higher proficiency in Portuguese (than in Apurinã) making use of
such a prosodic strategy to distinguish non-restrictive from restrictive ClRELs —since this
strategy is available for speakers of Portuguese.
9.1.1.5Relative Pronominal Markers as Tripartite Morphemic Clusters
Now that all the syntactic distinctions found in ClRELs have been described, theglossing of the various relative pronominal markers given in Table 1 earlier in the chapter
can be finally revised into a more detailed morphemic description, such as the one
provided in Table 2. In this table the first column shows the types of ClRELs that can be
distinguished on the basis of the grammatical role of the headREL in the ClREL and on the
basis of how the headREL is affected by the presence of the coreferential relative
pronominal marker in the verb. 4 The second column (and sub-columns under GRs &
Voice, where GRs=Core Grammatical Relations) lists the bi-phonemic morphemes that
mark whether the headREL is subject, object, or whether the ClREL is actorless or the4The fact that all markers of grammatical relations and voice in ClRELs start with -k may be used to argue that -k is
also a morpheme —for example, a marker of relativization. I have chosen to analyze -k as part of the markers of
grammatical relations and voice so as to reduce the number of ambiguities which is already very large even in the
current morpheme breaking used here.","[616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622]"
"9.1.2 Complement Subordination
Complement subordination is here defined as the process by which a complex
sentence is formed of two or more clauses, wherein one functions as the subject/object of
the other. Although complex sentences (and hence complementation) are less common in
Apurinã than, for example, in languages like English, two general types of complements
can be distinguished on the basis of whether they carry any formal marker of
subordination. In other words, complements can be described in terms of how
(dis)similar they are to a full sentence. Complements that carry no formal marking of
subordination and that, thus, resemble the most complete sentences, are described under
full sentence complements. Complements that carry a formal marking of subordination
and/or that are reduced forms of full sentences are described under marked
complements. A full sentence complement is to be understood as a complete sentence
that minimally has all the (morpho)syntactic expressions of the core arguments (i.e.
subject and/or object), where such (morpho)syntactic expressions may take the form of
the phrasal units described in chapter 8, section 8.1.1, or of the subject/object pronominal
markers described in chapter 7, in subsections 7.1.1 and 7.1.12. The constituent structure
of the clauses that realize a complete sentence was provided in 8.1.1.1, and the types of
these clauses were described in chapter 8.4.
The current description of complementation is more of a general survey of the
complement types found in the language based on their formal properties than an indepth analysis of each of these types. Further analysis on the behavioral properties of the
597complements and their sub-components is necessary, as well as analysis specifically
about the semantics of the complement-taking verbs. The terms used here to label the
semantic category of the complement-taking verbs (i.e. utterance, perception,
knowledge... verbs) as well as the semantic classification itself are partly based on
Noonan (1985:110-133).
9.1.2.1Full Sentence Complements
Full sentence complements are those that carry no formal subordination markingand that can stand by themselves as a sentence. Full sentence complements can function
as objects of utterance verbs, immediate perception verbs, and at least one manipulative
verb.
In the first pair of examples in (44) the full sentence complements (between
brackets) are direct quotations that function as objects of the utterance verb txa ‘say’: (In
the examples below brackets are used to highlight the complement of the sentence.)

As can be seen from (44) and (45a), there is no formal distinction between direct
and indirect quotation as a complement object of the utterance verb. The distinction
between direct in indirect quotation, however, can be made prosodically, with a longer
pause between the verb form and its complement for direct quotations. I should also note
that the utterance verb txa has one property that distinguishes it from other complement
taking verbs, namely that its complement necessarily precedes it. So, the following
example in (46) can be compared to the one given in (44b) to illustrate the property that
the utterance verb txa has of allowing only pre-verbal complement clauses. As shown by
both of the ungrammatical translations of the example in (46), this distributional
restriction on the complement of the utterance verb txa applies regardless of whether the
complement txa is a direct or indirect quotation:

The next pair of examples in (47) further illustrates full sentence complement
objects of utterance verbs, here with the verb sãpire-ta ‘to tell’:599S

The semantic difference between sãpire-ta and txa, is that the former is the one used to
mean ‘to tell a story’, but that, different from ‘tell’ in English, does not take a third core
argument. Otherwise, there is a partial overlap in the semantics of these two utterance
verbs. Moreover, the pre-verbal restriction on the complements of txa does not apply to
sãpire-ta:
The examples provided in (48) illustrate the immediate perception complementtaking verb etuka ‘to see’, in (48a-b), and a manipulative complement-taking verb akirita

Aside from the unmarked full sentences that function as the complement in theexamples presented above, there are marked complements clauses that carry the gerund
marked -inhi, morphologically described in chapter 4, subsection 4.4.7, and that
constitute the most common type of complement clauses found in the language. In 4.4.7
the gerund marker was described as part of the noun stem morphology; at the end of this
subsection the syntactic category of the verb forms to which -inhi attaches will be revised
on the basis of the syntactic properties presented below. Further distinctions among
complement clauses can be established on the basis of the formal marking properties of
their major components.
The first type of marked complement clauses to be described is one marked with
-inhi in the verb and whose undergoer is marked as object of the matrix clausal verb.
That is, insofar as the formal marking goes, these examples can be described as
constructions where the undergoer object of the transitive verb in the complement clause
is “raised” into the object of the verb in the matrix clause. The term “raising” (and its
derived forms) is with quotation marks so as to highlight the fact that the term is being
used here to refer to linguistic phenomena that only partially fit into the established
typology of raising constructions (as, e.g., the one discussed in Noonan 1985:68-73).
As the example in (49) shows, complements with object-object “raising” can
occur with a knowledge verb. In this example, -inhi occurs in the second clause to make
it a subordinate clause functioning as the object of the first clause:601s-V-o

‘He knows how to make canoe.’
In (49) ããta ‘canoe’ is the object of the verb u-kam-inhi-ro in the complement clause.
Although the presence of the coreference marker -ro in this verb would normally indicate
that ããta is the grammatical object in the complement clause (see grammatical properties
of the object under 8.3.1.2), there are two additional properties in the sentence suggesting
otherwise. The first is that, as shown in 8.3.1.2, it is a post-verbal (rather than pre-verbal)
object that is accompanied of the coreferential pronominal marker in the verb; and the
second is that there is also a coreferential pronominal marker -ro in the verb of the matrix
clause, thus indicating that ããta is in fact object in the matrix clause. One way to account
for the coreference marking in both the verbs of the matrix and the subordinating clause
is by postulating that the object of the complement clause has been “raised” to be the
object in the matrix clause, leaving a pronominal “copy” in the complement clause.
At the present time, this object-object “raising” analysis is a hypothesis that is
based on the formal marking of the objects in sentences such as the one illustrated above.
Further information on the behavior of the object in question is required in order to
demonstrate the viability of such a hypothesis.
The next examples in (50) illustrate complement clauses with -inhi attached to a
desiderative verb. In (50a) nu-serepi ‘my arrow’ is the undergoer and kuku is the
recipient of the verb marked with -inhi in the complement clause. However, the recipient
of the verb in the complement clause is marked (by the coreferential pronominal marker
-ru) as the object of the verb in the matrix clause. The undergoer serepi ‘arrow of’, as a
feminine noun, would require the pronominal marker -ro, rather than the masculine -ru.
602Moreover, as shown by the ungrammaticality of (50b), the marking of the undergoer
object of the verb in the complement clause as the object of the verb in the matrix clause
is an obligatory property of complex sentences with complements containing a
potentially ditransitive predicate. The example in (50b) is only ungrammatical because
the pronominal marker attached to the verb in the matrix clause is coreferential with the
undergoer (rather than with the recipient) of the verb:

kuku
nu-suk-inhi]
1SG-want-PRED-3F.O 1SG-arrow.of(F) man
1SG-give-GER
(I want to give the man my arrow.)
One way to explain the marking of the recipient of the verb in the complement
clause as the object of the verb in the matrix clause is by positing a “raising” of the
“recipient” expression in the complement clause into the object in the matrix clause.
Here, again, although this “raising” hypothesis would explain the formal marking
properties involving the objects of these complex sentences, it would be desirable to find
additional information on the behavioral properties of such objects that would confirm (or
disprove) this hypothesis. Ideally, a more detailed investigation into the behavioral
properties of core grammatical relations should reveal further distinctions between
subject and object. However, it remains to be shown whether such additional behavioral
distinctions are actually found in the language.
While the types of complements presented above are analyzable as object to
object “raising” constructions, the second type to be described would seem to involve an
603equi-object-control deletion, where the object of the complement-taking verb and the
subject of the verb in the complement clause are identical. In this second type of
complement the subject of the verb in the complement clause marked by -inhi is
coreferential with the object of the verb in the matrix clause. In both the examples in (51)
the subordinate clause is a complement of the manipulative verb awirita ‘allow’, is
marked by -inhi in the verb, and its subject is coreferential with the subject pronominal
marker n- in the complement clause and with object pronominal marker -no in the matrix
clause:

‘The thirst didn’t let me sleep.’
The third and last type of complement clauses marked with -inhi consists of those
that differ from full sentences in that they take the gerund marker -inhi and in that they
take a pronominal marker attached to the verb where such a marker could be interpreted
as coreferential with the complement itself, rather than with one of its arguments. In the
first pair of examples given in (52) the complex sentences have, respectively, the
commentative complement-taking verb potxita ‘like’ and the desiderative
complement-taking verb nereka ‘want’. In these examples the verbs of the complement
clauses are intransitive, they take the gerund marker as well as the bound pronominal
forms for first person singular subject. Moreover, the complement clauses in these604examples function as object of the complement-taking verbs, being marked as such with
the default gender marker for third person object, -ru, in the matrix verb:

]
b. nota nereka-ka-ru
[nhi-nhipoko-t-inhi]
1SG want-PRED-3M.O 1SG-eat-VBLZ-GER
‘I want to eat.’
It is important to observe that this third type of marked complements is
translatable into English as equi-subject constructions (i.e. where the subject of the
complement clause in deleted under identity with the subject of the matrix clause.)
Different from English, however, in Apurinã the subject of the complement clause is not
deleted, but rather expressed as a bound pronominal marker in the verb of the
complement clause.
In concluding this subsection, I must reiterate that the analysis just presented
above for the three types of marked complements is not intended to be a definitive, since
supporting evidence is still required to (dis)prove its validity. Finally, it would be
conceivable to posit a very distinct analysis where the marked complement clauses would
only be syntactically different from full sentence complements in that the latter lack the
gerund marker -inhi. Nonetheless, the fact that the argument of the complement clause is
marked as argument of the matrix clause needs somehow to be explained. What is
presented here is one possible account of such marking patterns.","[628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636]"

/i-...-na/ (19, 18, 12)A general phonological rule (described in chapter 2, under 2.1.14) accounting for
derived long vowels is not represented in Table 7. The reflex of such a rule can,
nevertheless, be seen in the tables 2-6. The rule states that vowels other than // are realized
as long vowels whenever adjacent to another vowel of the same quality. As a consequence,
in the Apurinã of the Japiim village, whenever two identical vowels occur together in
morpheme boundaries they behave, phonetically, as long vowels. The process deriving long
vowels can then be stated and represented as follows:
21. Identical adjacent vowels other than // are realized as long vowels:
-high 
-high 


i.e., -central → [+long] / _-central (As mentioned in subsection 2.1.1.4 of chapter 2)
α

α

The examples in Table 8 illustrate the process of long vowel derivation. The accompanying
nasalization of long vowels is by the rule stated in (18).

147Conceivably, if more abstract rules are used, the rule stating the process of vowel
lengthening in morpheme boundaries could be generalized to all environments in the
language. All long vowels would derive from underlying short ones. Here, however, I will
only mention the possibility of such an alternative analysis, reserving such a higher level of
abstract generalization to more theoretically based approaches to the data. Such an analysis
would be done in an internal reconstruction of the Apurinã phonological system.","[177, 178, 179]"

The following example is given to show that the relative pronominal marker of

-koru gives place to -koro in the verb. And, the example in (23) shows that this same

negative marker is attached to the verb and, as result, the positive relative marker -koro

‘He still always eats.’8.6.2.2.4ImminentAnother type of imperfectivity marker is used when events are about to come to a
start or completion. This is what, for lack of a better term, is being called here the
imminent aspect, which is marked with the class2 bound form -napano (morphologically
described in 5.2.1.2.1.3). The most approximate English translation of -napano would be
‘about to’ or, in some cases, ‘nearly’. Examples illustrating the imminent marker are
given in (105):
s-V-IMMIN
105a. n-umaka-napano

‘I’m about to sleep.’

s-V-IMMIN-IMPFTV
c. nhi-nhipoko-ta-napano-panhi-ka
1SG-eat-VBLZ-IMMIN-IMPFTV-PRED
‘I’m still about to eat.’
527In (105a) the event described by the clause is that the speaker is ‘about to fall asleep’. In
(105b) the imminent marker -napano combines with the perfective marker -pe in the verb
to mark in the predicate the sense of ‘already being about to eat’. As the example in
(105b) illustrates, when the imminent marker is combined with the perfective marker,
completive perfectivity is canceled out, changing into an
“emphatic/highlighting/underscoring” marker of situations about to come into being. In
(105c) the imminent marker combines with the incompletive -panhi to describe a state
that ‘still is about to come into being’. As this last example illustrates, when imminent
and incompletive markers are combined the result is that again the ‘state of about to come
into being’ is “emphasized/highlighted/underscored”. However, the difference of the
imminent + completive versus imminent + incompletive combination is in terms of the
perspective imposed on the ‘“imminence” of what is come into being’: So, while for
(105b) the perspective is that the event ‘will come into being’ sooner rather than later, for
(105c) there is the invited inference that the event ‘will come into being’ later rather than
sooner. This invited inference explains why (105c) may also be translated as ‘It still will
take me some time before eating’.
The combination of imminent + completive and imminent + incompletive can
also be described, conversely, from the point of view of the (in)completive marker. The
presence of the completive marker with the imminent form in the verb changes the
unmarked pragmatic meaning of the latter. The use of the imminent marker carries with
it the invited inference that the event ‘will come into being’. While the presence of the
completive marker along with the imminent form reinforces this inference, the presence
of the incompletive marker along with the imminent cancels out the invited inference.
Although the cancellation of this invited inference can be accomplished with the
528imminent + incompletive combination, there also is in the language another
morphological form whose primary pragmatic function is precisely to impose the
opposite invited inference on the predicate, as described in the next subsection.
8.6.2.2.5Anti-PerfectiveThe last type of imperfectivity marker found in the language is -wari ‘almost’,
which, as the gloss suggests, occurs when a situation stops close to beginning or
completing. Since this imperfectivity marker blocks a situation from beginning or
completing (and also for the lack of a better term), I refer to -wari as a marker of an antiperfective aspect. In (106a) the situation reported is about ‘the near death of somebody’.
In (106b) the event is about ‘the speaker nearly getting bitten by a snake’. (106b) shows
the anti-perfective marker in a state about ‘the temperature being almost too hot’:
s-V-APFTV
106a. Ø-upũpe-wari-ta

‘He almost died.’

V-APFTV-o
c. ka-pataka-powa-wari-ru
ATTR-be.hot-AUGM-APFTV-3M.O
‘It’s almost too hot.’
When only events are considered (i.e. disregarding descriptive verbs), the
imminent and the anti-perfective are semantically similar insofar as both have the general
property of marking a situation approaching a start or completion. They are different,
however, as to the perspective they impose on events that can be objectively described as
529identical in the real world. When the imminent aspect is used, the interpretation tends to
be one where the event is more likely than not to begin or reach a completion. When the
anti-perfective is used, the interpretation tends to be one where the event is more likely
than not to not have begun or completed. Compare for example the example in (107) to
that in (105a):
s-V-APFTV
107. n-umaka-wari-ta
1SG-sleep-APFTV-VBLZ
‘I almost slept.’
The default interpretation for (105a) is that the speaker will sleep, whereas the opposite
interpretation is the default one for (107). Further, while both sentences can be
interpreted as expressing present and past events, (105a) but not (107) can be interpreted
as expressing an event that takes place in the immediate future. More than that, in
pragmatic terms, it is common to use the imminent (but not anti-perfective) marker in the
present. Although anti-perfective can be used in the present, it is less commonly used in
such a way. It is due to these semantic and pragmatic reasons that imminent and antiperfective markers carry with them opposite invited inferences: While the former invites
a positive inference that the event will begin or complete, the latter invites the negative
inference that the event will not begin or complete.","[557, 558, 559, 560, 561]"

"420As was briefly mentioned in the previous subsection, of all the 14 position classes
occupied by the special bound formatives described earlier (7.1.1-7.1.14), only those
occupied by the oblique markers and the restrictive marker cannot be part of a verb base.
Conversely, only the gerund marker, the “passive” marker, and the object markers cannot
be part of a typical noun base. Although a more complete survey is necessary in order to
determine exactly which closed word classes can take any of the special bound
formatives, the preliminary evidence presented above suggests that all special bound
formatives that attach to a noun base also attach to one or more of the closed word
classes. For the purpose of describing the general distributional properties of special
bound formatives, these formatives can be presented in terms of whether they occur with
verb bases, with noun bases, with closed class word bases, or with a combination of these
bases. Table 4, where “other bases” refer to any one or more word bases that belong to
closed word classes, summarizes the information about the word category of the possible
host bases of each one of the special bound formatives:421Table 4: Special Bound Formatives and the Category of Their Host Base

+A general property shared by almost all special bound formatives, which is made
explicit in Table 4, is the fact that, except for the gerund, “passive”, and object markers,
every other special bound formative attaches to two or more distinct word categories.
Conversely, except for the gerund marker, “passive”, and object markers, no other special
bound formative occurs exclusively with one word category. Hence, out of 14 slots for
special bound formatives, 7 are found in with at least three distinct word categories, 4 are
found with two word categories, and 3 are found with one word category (namely, the
verb). The property that special bound formatives have of occurring with one or more
host bases of distinct word categories can be used to classify special bound formatives
into three types, as represented in Table 5. In this table, special bound formatives that
attach to host bases of three or more word categories are termed floating special bound
formatives; those that attach to host bases of at least two word categories are termed
quasi-floating special bound formatives; and, those that attach to host bases of one422specific word category are termed non-floating special bound formatives:

OBJECTTherefore, the general tendency is for special bound formatives to be floating or
quasi-floating rather than non-floating. On these grounds, some qualifications need to be
made about the non-floating minority subset of special bound formatives. Such
qualifications apply to the presence/absence of oblique markers in verb bases, to the
presence/absence of object markers in noun bases, and to the status of the “passive”
marker in the language. First, at least some oblique markers are found in deverbal-like
bases. Deverbal-like bases are the word forms that show both noun and verb properties,
and that consist of a verb plus the gerund marker or plus a relativizer. The examples
below constitute instances of an oblique marker attached to deverbal-like bases: The goal
marker -mokaru attaches to V-inhi in (51a) and to V-kuto in (51b):
51a. aiko
nota s-inhi-mokaru
house 1SG go-GER-GOAL
‘My going to the house...’
423b. i-txa
kema owa
hãtako-ro Ø-anhi-kuto-mokaru
3M-say tapir 3SG.F youth-F
3M-take-REL.F.O-GOAL
‘The tapir said to her, the woman whom it took away.’
A detailed discussion of the nominal and verbal properties of V-inhi and V-kuto will be
presented within the appropriate syntactic context in chapter 9, in 9.1.2.2.3 and 9.1.1.6,
respectively.
The second qualification to be made is about the presence/absence of object
markers in noun bases. There is a limited set of noun forms that take the object marker
when these noun forms function as the predicator in a clause. The examples in (52)
present instances of noun bases that function as predicators of non-verbal clauses, and
that take the first person object marker –no, in (52a-b), or the second person object
marker -i, in (52c-d), to encode the sole argument of the predicator:
52a. kiyomane-txi-nhi-pẽ-ka-no
elder-UNPOSS-AFFECT-PFTV-PASS-1SG.O
‘I’ve become old.’
b. kona hãtako-ru-ka-no

‘I’m not young.’
c. popũka-ru-ka4-ra-i
Apurinã-M-PRED-FOC-2SG.O
‘Are you’re Apurinã.’
d. kãkutu-ka4-ra-i
person-M-PRED-FOC-2SG.O
‘Are you’re a (white) person.’
The third qualification, about the functional status of the “passive” marker, is that,
as was made explicit in 7.1.8, the grammatical function/meaning of the “passive” marker
may be undergoing changes in the language, going from a passive marker to a marker of
424a specific subtype of perfectivity. These changes, however, require a better
understanding. At the present time, the current data available do not allow a conclusive
analysis of the function of the “passive” marker or of the distribution of this formative in
terms of the range of the host bases it attaches to. That is, it still is possible that the fact
that the “passive” marker has been attested only with verb bases may be an artifact of the
data available.
Examples such as those in (51-52) would then seem to suggest that some of the
cases (of non-floating formatives) that are listed in Table 5 as possible exceptions to the
predominant (quasi-)floating property of special bound formatives would actually be no
exceptions. However, in the present work, I will maintain the exceptional status of the
oblique markers as well as of the object markers for two specific reasons. The first
reason is that the deverbal-like bases share both noun and verb properties (as will be later
shown in detail in chapter 9, in 9.1.1.6 and 9.1.2.2.3). The second reason is that
examples such as (52), where an object marker attaches to a predicator noun base, so far
have been attested in the speech of a single speaker. It is possible that examples such as
those in (52) are specific to a speech variety that still requires further investigation, in
which case it remains to be shown how representative such examples are of the
morphosyntactic properties of non-verbal clauses in the language. (Non-verbal clauses
are described in chapter 8, in 8.4.2.) Nonetheless, if the status of the gerund, “passive”,
and object marker turns out to be confirmed as non-floating formatives, they would still
differ from the typical affixes found in the language, even if only insofar as they occur
outside of typical affixes in the same way as do (quasi-)floating special bound formatives.
Here may be a good place to note that it is NOT the case that the distribution of
special bound formatives can be predicted in any obvious way on the basis of the surface
425syntactic structure of the language as it applies to free (i.e., non-phonologically bound)
word forms. In other words, although special bound formatives may occur most often in
a particular position in the clause, they do not occupy fixed positions, for example, at the
edge of phrases or clauses. Take, as a first example, the perfective marker -pe. -pe is a
floating special bound formative that occurs most often attached to verb forms. In (53a)
-pe is shown attached to a clause-final verb; in (53b) it occurs attached to a main verb
which precedes the clause-final auxiliary verb; and, in (53c) it attaches to a verb form that
occurs clause initially:
53a. oposo uwa
kema anhika
txa-pe-ro
PTC 3SG.M tapir take.away AUX-PFTV-3F.O
‘So, the tapir, it took her away.’
b. oposo uwa-kata
su-pe
o-txa
PTC 3SG.M-ASSOC go-PFTV 3F-AUX-PFTV
‘Then she went with it.’
c. ĩ-imata-pe-ro
owa
3M-mate-PFTV-3F.O 3SG.F
‘It had intercourse with her.’
As an instance of a non-floating special bound formative, take the gerund marker
-inhi. -inhi is non-floating because it attaches only to verb bases, as was shown in 0. As
the examples in (54) illustrate, -inhi can occur in host verb bases that are in clause-final,
clause-medial or clause-initial position:
54a. i-ye
komeru i-ye
katarokuru a-kam-inhi
M-PROX manioc M-PROX manioc.flour 1PL-make-GER
‘…our making of this manioc and of this manioc flour.’
b. nh-ita-ru

‘In remembering of my cousin, I came here.’
426c. a-yana-poko-t-inhi
uwã
1PL-walk-DISTR-VBLZ-GER there
‘Our visiting around there...’
However, although examples such as (54c) can be attested in spontaneous discourse, it is
the case that the verb base taking -inhi rarely occurs clause initially. That is, the norm is
for -inhi to occur with host bases in clause-medial or clause-final position. This
“dispreference” for the clause initial position is most likely to follow from two properties
of the gerund marker: First,-inhi generally functions as a marker of subordinated clause
(as will be shown in chapter 9, under 9.1), and it happens that Apurinã subordinate
clauses tend to follow rather than precede the matrix clause. Second, -inhi attaches to
verb bases and, as it happens, verbs normally occur in clause—medial or in clause-final
position —when one or more free argument expression(s) is/are found in the clause (as
will be shown in chapter 8, in 8.9.5). Hence, the “dispreference” for clause-initial
position for the host base -inhi to attach to is a by-product of the functional properties of
-inhi as well as of the distributional properties of its host verb base, NOT the result of any
syntactic rule applying to -inhi itself.
As an instance of a quasi-floating special bound formative, take the restrictive
marker -nanu. As (55) illustrates, -nanu occurs with (pro)nominal host bases that are in
clause-initial or in clause-medial position:
watxa ata nhi-pe
55a. a-serota-re-nanu-ra
1PL-salt-POSSED-RESTR-FOC today 1PL eat-PFTV
‘Nowadays (it’s) only with salt that we eat.’
b. uwa-nanu

apa-monhika-ãpo-ta
fetch-GOAL-RANDOM-VBLZ
‘…it was only the language of the elders that we’d go about learning.’
In contrast to the gerund marker, the restrictive marker simply does not occur (in text
material) in host bases that are in clause-final position. This restriction, however, again is
more likely to follow from the meaning properties of the restrictive marker, rather than
from a purely syntactic constraint on its distribution. -nanu individualizes the referential
properties of the (pro)nominal base it attaches too roughly in the same way that the word
only, just and alone do in English. In doing so, -nanu restricts the application of the
meaning conveyed by the predicator of the clause and highlights the importance of the
referent expressed by the (pro)nominal base which -nanu attaches to. Thus, the
“dispreference” for clause-final position is likely to follow from the discourse-pragmatic
properties associated with -nanu. Analogous discourse-pragmatic properties can be more
easily shown to play a role in the placement of the focus of attention marker, -ra
(described in 7.1.11). -ra is a floating special bound formative whose function is to bring
the focus of attention onto the word base to which it attaches. Thus, the
function/meaning of -ra is clearly a discourse one. As it happens, the host bases to which
-ra attaches show strong preference for clause-initial position, although it can sometimes
occur clause-medially. The examples in (56) illustrate the distribution of -ra:

‘Then it would be with him that we’d go.’
-ra occurs in the first word in the clause in (56a, c). Notice that, as it is clear in (56b, d),
the actual preference is not for -ra to occur in the first word; instead, the strong
preference is for the phrasal constituent (rather than simply the word form) with which
-ra occurs to be positioned clause-initially. Moreover, as illustrated in (56e-f), when the
phrasal constituents in which -ra is found do occur clause-medially, these phrasal
constituents are generally preceded by a clause-initial discourse particle —which do not
constitute constituents of the clause. (A detailed discussion of constituent structure will
be presented in chapter 8, in 8.1-2) Here, again the strong preference for a specific
position inside the clause is not necessarily determined by any syntactic constraint but,
instead, it follows from the meaning and functional properties of the special formative in
question. In the case of -ra, it makes perfect sense (from a discourse and cognitive
perspective) to place in the beginning of the clause the construction whose focus of
attention is called for.
429One last important aspect of the distribution of special bound formatives in the
clause is that at least some of them can occur more than once in different host bases in the
same clausal construction —in a way reminiscent of agreement markers in other
languages. It is this repetition of the same special bound formative in the same clausal
construction that is illustrated by the examples in (57): (Repeated forms are underlined in
these examples.)

(57a) illustrates the occurrence of the affectedness marker both in a subject
expression and in a relativized verb form. (57b) illustrates the occurrence of the
frustrative marker both in an associative expression and in a verb form. (57c) illustrates
the occurrence of both frustrative and the future markers in an associative expression and
in a verb form. Finally, (57d-e) illustrate, respectively, the occurrence of the perfective
and the predicate markers both in the main verb and in the auxiliary forms. No case has
been attested where the same special bound form occurs both in a verb form and in its
430expression of its object. Also, no case has been attested of the same special bound
formative being used both in the possessor and in the possessed forms in the same
possession construction. Exactly what the factors determining if/when a special bound
formative can or cannot be repeated in a clausal construction still needs to be determined.
Nevertheless, there is no indication that there is any grammatical factor(s) that is/are
systematically associated with the agreement-like property of some special bound
formatives. In fact, the repetition of the same special bound formative within a syntactic
construction is structurally optional, and, most likely, is motivated by discoursepragmatic factors still to be determined. Nevertheless, regardless of what the motivating
factors are, the fact that some special bound formatives can be repeated in the same
construction constitutes an important distinction between these special bound formatives
and any of the affix forms described in the previous chapters.","[451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462]"
