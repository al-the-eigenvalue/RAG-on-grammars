"A G R A M M A R O F THE K O L O K U M A D I A L E C T O F IJOPHONOLOGYT h e various punctuation marks are used to indicate grammatical structure or intonation:
semicolon: end of subordinated or co-ordinated sentence
colon: beginning of reported speech
dash: beginning of recapitulatory phrase (5.2.7, 5.z.10); end of reported speech preceding main sentence (5.2.8)
full stop: end of main sentence, normal intonation
question mark: end of main sentence, question intonation (7.3.6)
exclamation mark: end of main sentence with emphatic intonation; end of vocative or
interjection. (Emphatic intonation has not been fully studied, but it appears to involve
length, raising of high tones, and sometimes raising of a series of low tones:

now developed. They are:
(a) Emphasis, hitherto shown by underlining the affected unit (6.4.5).
(b) Interrogation, shown by a question mark after the string affected (5.1.7).
(c) A recapitulatory phrase following reported speech (~.z.Io),introduced by a dash.
All these modifications are essentially intonational in character; it is of interest that the
specific devices uscd are not dissimilar to those of English. Thus the change of tone
pattern to emphasize a particular unit often involves raising the tone of one syllable and
lowering that of others, a process markedly like that which Pike describes in English
when a 'special centre of selective attention' replaces a 'normal' one. (INTONATION
OF
AMERICAN ENGLISH 44 (AnnArbor, 1945).) Questions in English without a special interrogative word are oftcn, as in Ijg, indicated by a change of intonation. Finally, the use of
an all-low tone pattern, which is otherwise very unusual in Kolokuma? in a recapitulatory
phrase following reported speech iinds its counterpart in what Pike calls a 'weak rhythm
unit', one of the principal types of which is 'an indication of the speaker' after reported
speech (op. cit. 39).
It occurs otherwise only when an all-low class IV unit is followed by another unit: igbon ikirai
'Hausa bamboo'.",[57]

further investigation, and could also be considered in connection with aspect marlcers.

7.3.2 Emphatic tone patterns will now be described. I n formulas the unit to he emphasized will, instead of being underlined, be enclosed in wedges (< >)to avoid confusion with
the underlining which indicates that more than one syllable is possible in that position. I t is
understood that the lastvowel of the emphasized unit has in many cases been lengthened by
M.106; the extra syllable is not indicated on the left-hand side, but on the right-hand side
its tone is given, enclosed in parentheses if emphatic length is optional in that formula.
A unit in an initial low sequence is emphasized by its last syllable becoming high, while
the original high syllahle of the group becomes low.wo nama 5 6

regard to tone phrase boundaries. I t occul-s only when two identical vowels occurring
in juxtaposition belong to different units: i.e. as a result of the vowel replacement rules,
Where a tone is elided the vowel is also, of course, automatically elided.
A UNIQUE tone is a tone that is immediatcly prcceded and followed by tones different frorn
itself: e.g. a high tone flanked on both sides by low tones. Other toncs are NON-UNIQUE.
M.118 If both tones are unique, both are retained.

If only the second tone is unique, it is retained and the first tone is elided.

I n the first example the first tone is unique and the second non-unique; in the second
neither is unique. I n both, the first tone is retained and the second elided.
A useful short formula for the vowel and tone elision is: 'Tone of first, vowel of second,
unless second is unique'. T h e follou~ingcontrast is instructive:
the Yam took . .
buru-bi, akj
-t /bhrhbiik//
+ /birrCbiki/

buru-bi hkj
I n both, the first tone (that of -bi) is unique. I n the first example, the tone of the initial
syllable of akjz is also unique; both tones are therefore retained (M.118). I n the second
example, the tone of the initial syllable of ak/%is not unique, and therefore M.120 is
applied.","[59, 60]"
"PHONOLOGYA GRAMMAR O F T H E KOLOKUMA D I A L E C T O F I J OA unit containing no vowel but a is followed by the open form of a monosyllabic enclitic

bri-m j

An enclitic which is disyllabic or which contains vowels other than i does not harmonize

b+-qimi

b6-qjmj

baqi-kymQ don't run
mlj-kym? don't go
wiri-m?-se all the houses
kiri-mq-se all the farms
I n respect of vowel harmony, therefore, hyphen juncture indicates that a monosyllabic
affix containing a high vowel harmonizes with the unit to which it is affixed.
I n exceptionally deliberate speech the enclitic does not harmonize; this fact is descrihed
phonologically as the substitution of word for hyphen juncture.
Occasionally a capital letter is used as a cover symbol for either the close or open
vowel; e.g. I=either i or j.
I .3 NASALIZATION1.3.1 Nasalization operates within a unit and is symholized by -n at the end of a
syllable (i.e. preceding a consonant or juncturc). T h e nasal consonant n occurs only at the
beginning of a syllable (i.e. preceding a vowel), so that no ambiguity arises from this
double use of the symbol.
Nasaliiation occurs:
(a) Before a continuant or juncture. It is realized as nasalization of the preceding vowel.

(In the last example, length is mal.ked; a phonemically nasalized vowel preceding a nasal
is longer than a non-phonemically nasalized vowel in the same position.) Any w r y or
vowel immediately preceding a nasalized vowel in the same unit is perceptibly nasalized.
Similarly, any w r y or vowel preceding a phoneme which has itself become nasalized by
contact with a nasalized phoneme is nasalized, except that it is not easy to perceive the
nasalization of an initial vowel. All this nasalization is predictable and is therefore not
marked in the transcription:

however, checks the nasalization; it is neither perceived nor registered on the lrymograph
later in the unit (tracings made by J. D. M. H. Laver):16[hm be:]

The treatment of a nasal before a plosive as nasalization involves partial intersection of
the prosodeme of nasalization with the three nasal phonemes m n q. No ambiguity arises,
however, and this analysis is considered simpler than either of the two main alternatives:
(a) [mb nd qg rgg^b mp qk] are single phonemes, prenasalized plosives. This adds six
relatively uncommon phonemes to the inventory, and has the further disadvantage that
syllable division falls in the middle of a phoneme (an-driz 'wrestle', not a-ndi2).
(b) [m b nd qg q$ mp q k] are clusters. This involves setting u p a phoneme q with
extremely limited distribution: occurring only before the voiced labiovelar plosive g b.
There is a third alternative which avoids these difficulties. A distinctive feature analysis
which did not go through a phoneme level would specify lahiovelar nasality at this point
without assigning it to a phoneme. T h c phoneme level is, however, so useful (e.g. in
1.4.4) that it would create more difficulties than it solved to jettison it.
In favour of the equation of the nasalization of a vowel with the homorganic nasal
before a plosive is the free variation between ongo4 and ?got14 'lime'.
Some units begin with a syllable consisting only of nasalization+tone, preceding a
plosive: nbel$j4 'lizard', n d a 4 'but'. There is considerable variation in many units,
some idiolects having an initial vowel preceding the nasalization, others not: inbelel or
nbele~'swect'. But all idiolects have some units which always begin with a vowel (andiz
'wrestle', ?ngQz 'body, self'), and some which always begin with nasalization (ndai4 'but',
ng$e4 'cry of child'). I t is therefore not possible to set up initial nasalization as a sequence
vowel-1-nasalization, with the vowel realized as zero and the nasalization hearing the tone;
it has to be set u p as a special syllable type.","[11, 12]"

2. b d g gb are fully voiced throughout.3. kp gb are voiceless and voiced plosives with simultaneous labial and velar release.
a series of kymograph measurements made by J. D. M. H. Laver, the stop portion of
tile doubly-articulated kp was not found, in intervocalic position, to be consistently
longer than the singly-articulated p, lk. Both labiovelars are produced wit11 rounded lips.
4. After hyphen juncture d is in free variation with t ; in some idiolects, only t occurs
in this position. t is favoured by older speakers and is therefore probably the older form,
but d was more comlnon among informants (mostly of the younger generation) and has
normally been written. I t occurs only in:
-d+y, -d+j immediate past tcnse
-di
and (linking verbs)
-d+l@ (older form -tei!<j, from -t$j 'immediate past'+-kj 'emphatic') after
-d$s+ (older form -te/s+, from -tej 'immediate past'+-sq 'all') after
5. f v are labiodental fricatives.
6 . [s z] are, for bilingual speakers, in free variation with [J d31 in forms borrowed
from English:
[Iligi] or [sligi] ssdgi sugar
[ind3?ni] or [idni] inzini engine.
The question arises of the point at which new phones introduced through loanwords are
to be treated as phonemes. Two phonemes 1,j could he set u p in forms where there is
alternation, s and z being restricted to forms which do not show the variation. But the
fact that speakers make such statements as: 'We don't have J in our language', and 'Our
language should not be spelt Jjo; it should be Tzqn' suggest that a phoneme j is not yet
have not been heard;
recognized by Roloknma speakers. (Similar statements about
this probably rcflects two facts: (a) it is less common, and (b) it is not represented by a
single graph in English spelling.)
The use of [I], [d3] in sucb words is comparable to the use by educated English speakers
of [XI, varying with [k], in German names like Bach. For many English speakers, there
are styles of speech where [k] in these forms would be unacceptable, and where i t is
consequently hard to avoid phonemicizing x. It is, on the othcr hand, doubtful whether
there are styles of spcech in Kolokuma where [s], [z] are unacceptable in loanwords.
(The status situation is interesting; English has for long had prestige as the mark of
education, but there is now a nationalistic tendency, particularly among young men, to
condemn the use of English loanwords and to note, if not definitely to disparage, phones
like [d3] as 'English'.)
On the whole, therefore, it is preferable not to set u p /J/, /j/ at present, but a change in
the system could easily come about at this point.
7. h is required only to account for the interjection eh6& 'oho!' If a separate phonological system or subsystem is set up to describe interjections, h is not necessary to the
main system.[nI9A GRAMMAR O F THE K O L O K U M A D I A L E C T O F J J O8. Some speakers in some stylcs have one more phoneme not included in Table 3: a
very weak voiced velar fricative gh. It occurs in only four forms, three of which are very
common: -gh? 'locative', -gha 'negative', -gh6m+e 'past tense before reported speech'.
If these were the only cases, [y] could be set u p as the allophone of g or h that follows
hyphen juncture. But it also occurs in isaghik 'cottonwood', so that in intervocalic
position it contrasts with both g and h.
I n most contexts gh is segmentally zero for most spealcers; those who use [y] at all
apparently do so only when it is emphasized. T h e fact that gh is written in the orthography no doubt encourages the use of [y] in reading aloud. I n this study the speech of
those who do not use gh has been followed. T h e three common forms given above are
thus written -?, -a, -am&. Each is preceded by a new syllable onset, which is phonologically interpreted as a featurc of hyphen juncture preceding a vowel.
9. w r y are treated as a set because they all become nasalized in the vicinity of a nasal
(1.3.').
10. r is usually a single flap, but is apparently fricative for at least some speakers. I t
occurs initially only in the rare word riti* 'frame on which yams are tied for storage'
(probably a loanword), and in free variation with an initial vowel in riril or iriril 'feeling
of sorrow'. English loanwords normally acquire an initial vowel: or@]., 'rice', or6dA4
'Rhoda'.
11. m n q have already been noted to nasalize vowels in their vicinity (I .3 .z).
12. q occurs initially in the unit only after hyphen juncture in the single form -9jmj or
-gj 'future tense'. Otherwise it occurs only as second consonant (i.e. when another
consonant has already occurred in the unit), and is often in free variation with nasalization of the preceding and following vowels: bHq/
b q n 'run'; but only yeqi 'mother'.
13. 1 is always a clear variety.","[13, 14]"
"46This chapter and the next two deal with transformations of the verb phrase, the noun
$rase, and the sentence respectively. Whatever part of the sentence they deal with,
transformationsare, in Lees's terms, either SIMPLE or GENERALIZED. A simple transformationinvolves re-ordering of a single string by means of additions, deletions, and/or changes
order. A generalized transformation combines two strings into a single one; it is either
or co-ordinating. I n a subordinating transformation, a certain part of a
CONSTITUENT sentence (labelled b) is incorporated into a MATRIX sentence (labelled A),
and normally precedes the part of the matrix sentence it is modifying. Otherwise stated,
subordinated or modifying elements normally precede the head. I n a co-ordinating
twosentences, labelled A and B, of roughly equal structure, are combined;
of the second sentence is co-ordinate with and follows part of the first sentence.
The following conventions and symbols are used in transformational rules in addition
to those introduced in chapter z.
In the structural description (SD), the source strings upon which the transformation
operates are specified, the various relevant parts heing separated by commas. (Commas
in transformational or morphophonemic formulae are used only for convenience in a
particular rule, to separate the elements to be re-ordered, and therefore do not have the
same.reference as those in the examples, which are used to separate tone phrases.) T h e
symhols W , X, Y, Z are used to denote parts of a sentence whose internal structure is
irrelevant to the transformation in question; the convention is observed that, within one
transformation, if X, etc., is used twice, it has the same internal structure each time.
Any conditionslimitingthe applicationof the rule arestated after thestructural description.
The elements separated by commas are assigned numbers. I n the structural change
(SC), these numbers are re-arranged, some occurring in a different order, some heing
omitted (for deletions), and added elements heing inserted at the appropriate place.
The symbol =- means 'is transformed into'. Wherever square brackets are used, an element
in a particular position in the first set of square brackets corresponds only to the element
in the matching position in the second set.
I n examples, two source sentences are linked by a brace and the transformation arrow
follows directly to introduce the resulting transform.
Transformations are only partially ordered, in that they have been arranged in groups
dealimg with particular structures. Within the groups, each of which occupies one of the
major sections of a chapter, rules are ordered, but the groups are not ordered with respect
to one another.
Transformations are numbered consecutively T.1, T.z, etc.; morphophonemic rules
are numbered M.1, M.z, etc. Transformational rules are optional except when stated to
he obligatory, morphophonemic rules are obligatory except when stated to he optional.

"0,5 T H E PRIISENTSTUDY
0.5.1 Fieldwork in Kaiama was carried out in August-September, 1957, June-July,
1959, and October, 196z-Jannary, 1963. T h e chief informants were:
Mr. F. Agara, church clerk (1959, 1962)
Mr. A. A. Akene, teacher (1957, 1959)
Mr. 0. A. Egberipou, teacher (1957, 1959, 1962-3)
Mr. Pianto Egberipou, secondary school student (1957, 1959)
Miss F. Kai, teacher (1957)
Mr. J. Orumokinren, trader (1957)
Mr. A. 0. Timitimi, trader and church treasurer (1959, 1962-3).
In 1959 a number of texts were collected from two elderly monolingual informants,
Chief 2. Amaran and Chief Y. Soobai, with the help of the Rev. J. Buseri. A little work
was also done in the United States with Mr. L. Ekpebu, a graduate student of Princeton
University. All of these people helped willingly, patiently, and with great interest in the
work. T h e discovery of the passive, for example, is due to Mr. 0. A. Egberipou, who
took the trouble to refute a statement that Tj? had no constluction corresponding to the
English passive.
0.5.2 An attempt has been made to write a kind of generative transformational grammar. Certain features of fjp appear to lend themselves well to such a treatment: for
example, the limits of the tone groups within which elaborate tonal morphophonemics
take place are determined by syntax, a fact which strongly suggests that the morphophonemics are better treated after the syntax, as in transformational grammars, rather
than before it. T h e plus sign has been used throughout to unite syntactic elements which,
after the application of the morphophonemic tone rules, will occur in the same TONE
GROUP. When these elements have been joined into tone groups, some tone groups will be
linked up into TONE PHRASES, the conditions for such linking being no longer syntactic but
tonal. Tone patterns are, therefore, to be treated not in isolation, but as a systcrn partly
interlocking with the syntax. By the systematic use of the plus sign, the tonal relationships demanded by the syntax are carried through to the morphophonemic rules, where
they are tinally realized.
I n some other respects, however, the transformational model has not been followed.
Transformational grammars which treat phonology as distinct from morphophonemics
usually do so in a distinctive feature analysis following the morphophonemic rules. This
is possible where the language is a familiar one with an accepted orthography, hut in the
case of a little-known language such as Ijp a transcription has to be provided before the
syntax can be studied. For practical reasons, therefore, chapter I is devoted to phonology,A G R A M M A R O F THE ICOLOKUMA D I A L E C T O F T J O11with the aim of setting out a transcription which is useful in later chapters. It. would, of
course, be possible to add another chapter after the morphophonemics continuing the j
analysis down to distinctive feature level, but in view of the treatment in chapter I this
has not been thought necessary.
Keeping a phoneme level allows statistical statements of frequency to be made (e.g.
1.4.4-5). Such statements are important in that part of the vocabulary of Kolokuma, the
ideophones,6 can be shown to have a phonological structure which is statistically different
from that of the other parts (1.5).
0.5.3 As regards syntax, the model followed has been that developed in N. Chomsky's
SYNTACTIC STRUCTURFS (The Hague, 1957) and R. Lees's THE GRAMMAR OF ENGLISH
NOMINALIZATIONS (IJAL26:3, Part z , 1960). It is not suggested that this grammar is either
a complete exemplification of generative transformational grammar or that the data might
not be susceptible of a description, from another theoretical viewpoint, of equal or grcater
validity. T h e approach was adopted because it was thought that the practical attempt to
apply some of the new methods to a little-known language might be of interest, particularly since it bas been suggested that they can be applied only when the linguist has 'a
very deep and expert understanding of a language' (Lees, p.186). Two comments suggest
themselves on this statement. The first is that while certain deep underlying similarities
in a language rcquire expert knowledge, other parts of the grammar are open to quite
simple transformational statements (e.g. the active-passive relation). Secondly, it is
possible that languages have sufficient in common for similar rules to be applied to parts
of their grammars. Lees himself points out the close similarities between English and
German nominalizations. I t is more surprising to find that, in describing Ijg, many of
at least the more general rules for sentence and noun-phrase transformations are strongly
reminiscent of rules which would be necessary for English, and that only the structure
of the verb phrase appears markedly alien. If transformational analysis were developed
with contrastive grammar in mind, it might be possible for a relatively small number of
analyses made from deep knowledge to serve as reference points for a larger number of
grammars of languages for which more superficial information was available.
0.5.4 Some divergences from transformational practice in this grammar are due to the
fact that wo1.k on Kolokuma was done through informants, whereas in most transformational grammars so far published the linguist has been his own informant and the grammar has thercfore been that of a single idiolect. A neat, consistent analysis is often possible
for one idiolect which hrealcs down when a number of different idiolects are studied. The
study of I<olol~umais based largely on a corpus of texts (mostly folk tales and proverbs
with a few descriptive or historical texts) which were tape-recorded-and then transcribed,
with the help of informants, and also on a body of isolated sentences, many of which
were suggested by sentences in the texts and were elicited in the search for sentences
which bear a transformational relation to one another. There are thus a number of
idiolects and styles represented, and it is therefore necessary, at certain points, either to
suggest alternative rules (e.g. 7.1,6), to note that variation exists (e.g. 3 . 7 . ~ )or~ to leave
the rule open for further study.
0.5.5 The problem of idiolectal variation is related to another one, which is also raised
by working with texts given by informants. Some transformations appear to he much

~~~~~.%INTRODUCTIONmore basic than others: e.g. some expansions of the noun phrase, or the interrogative,
are basic enough to require description in any grammar, whereas certain ellipses occurring
in the texts would be described only where a requirement of comprehensive coverage of
the corpus had been made. Just as the kernel is in some sense more basic than the optional
transformations, so some of the transformations, and some transformed sentences, are
more basic than others.
hi^ conclusion is reinforced by observation of the editing carried on by informants
when they repeated slowly for transcription what had been recorded at a natural speed on
the tape; not only did they e l i i n a t e coughs and slips of the tongue, but they also left out
false starts, and even re-phrased something they felt ungrammatical when it was played
back. In particular, a bilingual informant translating a text recorded by an aged monolingual speaker frequently objected to the repetitious style of the old man and re-phrased
parts of it despite pleas to repeat exactly what was on the tape. The recording and the
final transcription were clearly both utterances in the language, but in different styles.
~t is suggested that such a d i i r e n c e in style can be correlated with the extent of transformation the utterance has undergone, the more colloquial unstudied one being transformed to a much greater degree.
If sentences can be repeatedly and indefinitely transformed in this way, it follows that
a grammar can produce all the sentences of a language only if a line is drawn at which a
sentence cannot be further transformed without ceasing to be a sentence. T h e exact line
might be arbitrary, but could be drawn somewhere near the point where informants
begin to re-phrase texts. (Presumably a linguist acting as his own informant normally
performs the same editing process for himself.) The degree of grammaticality, or alternatively the degree of colloquiality of style, of a particular recorded text could then be
described in terms of the proportion of sentences to non-sentences it contained.
0.5.6 The presence of informants has led to an attempt to formulate transformational
rules as realistic transformations of real sentences, intuition for extremely hypothetical
constructs not being available. Some difficulties arise in the course of this procedure, in
that realistic sources cannot be found for some strings, although these strings bear a
strong resemblance to others for which convincing sources are available. For example,
there is a fixed noun phrase t Q r y di ye 'spectacles, glasses', literally 'eye look-at thing'.
I t superficially resembles other noun-verb-noun phrases such as beni wen1 igbika
'rainboot', literally 'water walk thing', which is regularly generated by T . 3 2 T h e source
sentences necessary to generate t+ry di ye by T.32 do not, however, occur, and no other
convincing source can be found. T h e following rather ad hoc solution is suggested. Not
all apparent transforms are real ones, i.e. developed directly from source strings. Once
a pattern has been established (in this case, noun-verb-noun), similar strings are formed
to it by analogy to the transforms. Analogy is generally recognized as a factor in linguistic
change, and there seems no reason why it should not be active at the transformational
level as at others. T h e difficulty still remains of finding an adequate way of formulating
such analogical rules; if this can be done, the process involved is comparable to that
whereby a complex series of phonological rules is replaced by a simpler one (M. Halle,
WORD 18.65, 1962).
0.5.7 An effort has been made to give rules to account for as much as possible of the
text material. There has, therefore, been no attempt to present only rules which show
elegant transformational relationships. I n deciding what is to go into the phrase-structure
rules and what into the transformations, the guiding principle has, as far as possible, beenA GRAMMAR O F T H E KOLOICUMA D I A L E C T O F I J Oproductivity; that is, the constructions which occur in the most varied combinations with
other constructions have been assigned to the phrase-structure rules, less flexible constructions mainly to the transformations. Compromise has been necessary in the case of
elements which cannot reasonably be introduced transformationally and have therefore
been assigned to the phrase-structure rules out of necessity. For example, very little can
be done with interjections, but since they cannot he derived from anything else they are
necessarily introduced in the phrase-structure rules.
0.5.8 Semantic criteria have been used in a few cases where they seemed appropriate
and necessary, for example in the analysis of the aspect markers (2.1 .z and Appendix I).
It has been assumed that there are collocational as well as grammatical limitations on the
occurrence of morphemes, the collocational ones being those which can be predicted with
a high degree of probability from the English translation before the attempt is made to
elicit an Ijo equivalent, and which are, therefore, considered outside the scope of this
grammar.","[7, 8, 9]"

Vowel length has been treated as a sequence of two identical vowels for the following
reasons :A G R A M M A R O F TI-IE KOLOICUMA D I A L E C T O F IJOPHONOLOGY(a) Long vou~elsfrequently occur in speech, but they are usually morphophonemically
conditioned; either, within a unit, by tone (e.g. in isolation dil 'look at' is pronounced
[di:]), or, across junctures, by replacement of a unit-final vowel by the initial vowel of
the following unit (e.g. wo ere 'his name' becomes weere).
(b) Long vowels not so conditioned are comparatively uncommon. Six of the nine
examples given above occur in ideophones, which in other ways form a phonological
subsystem of the language (cf. 1.5). I t would therefore be attributing too much importance to long vowels in the total language system to set them up either as short vowels
with a prosodeme of length or as a series of long vowels corresponding to the short ones.
(c) There is an historical reason for supposing long vowels not very stable in Kolokuma. An intervocalic g which occurs in other dialects has been lost in Kolokuma.
Forms from which g has been lost are written with a doubled vowel in the conventional
orthography: e.g. paa 'cornelgo out', corresponding to Nembe pagaz and contrasting
with ba 'kill' (=Nembe 6az). Presumably there was a constant contrast in length between
the two forms when the orthography was devised about fifty years ago. At present a
distinction is apparently made by only a minority of speakers; for most informants there
is no contrast in length between
pa-a 'did not come out' [pi1&]
[bi'i]
and bi-a 'did not kill'
('=syllable onset).
I t therefore seems that length is not a stable feature of the Kolokuma system and is best
treated, where it occurs, as a special case of a two-vowel sequence.the units in the second column it is only necessary to mark the first open vowel for it
to be understood that any subsequent vowels in the same unit are also open:
+ria
see
bjouz
board (a boat)
bQlouz
first
ir!4
YOU sg.
ln a few cases, however, the vowel harmony is violated; all units in which this is so are
either recent loanwords or units which, historically or descriptively, consist of two
morphemes:
gomet14
Government
so (from *en[ iye 'that thing')
enii4
ktrrom?~ throw (from ktrroz 'fall'+=m? 'causative')
To accommodate these cases while marking only one open vowel in a unit it would be
necessary to write junctures in these forms:
gQ-meti4 Government
e-nii4
so
k6ro-m?
throw
Because in some cases vowel harmony extends across hyphen juncture (I.z.~), such a
transcription would make the rules for the application of vowel harmony very complex.
For the sake of clarity, therefore, each open vowel has been written with the diacritic and
the hyphen juncture not used in the forms above. This transcription has the advantage
of being a less violent departure from the conventional orthography (1.8).r .I .3 A few sequences of three vowels occur in the same unit. Three types of sequence
occur:
(a) All threevowels are different;the middle one is non-high and the first and third are high:
stiei~
thirty
bj?vz
board (a boat)
(b) Two contiguous vowels are identical; they are high and the remaining vowel is
non-high, or they are non-high and the remaining vowel is high:
g6iinz
pointed (of nose)
iriaan~
huge
(c) All three vowels are identical; only in interjections:
6ei4
that's it!
a6in4
oh indeed!
Long vowels are often prolonged for emphasis, but this is a non-discrete phenomenon
and is therefore not regarded as distinctive.","[10, 11]"

3.5 PASSIVEAND INTRANSITIVE
3.5.1 A passive is formed to transitive sentences with a definite object or to sentences
containing a locative (definite or indefinite), the subject in each case being indefinite.
Pronouns in this case act like definite nouns, since a sentence with a pronoun subject
has no passive. T h e passive is formed by change of word order and of tone pattern.

I n this example of the passive of a sentence containing alocative it is impossible to show
the difference between active and passive in the English translation. The construction is,
however, quite parallel to that of the passive of a transitive sentence. I n each case the subject of the active sentence immediately precedes the verb in the passive but forms a different
tone group from it; some tone groups l i d up (7.2) to form tone phrases (as in the second
example), while others remain unlinked, separated by a comma (as in the first example).

"PHRASE-STRUCTURE RULESZ.~
THESENTENCE AND THE PREDICATEPHRASE-STRUCTURE RULES
2.0 This chapter contains the phrase-structure rules of the grammar. They have been
kept as simple as is consistent with a reasonably full coverage, and are to be applied in
order. T h e principle followed in ordering the rules has been to develop constituents
roughly in their order of importance rather than strictly from left to right. Lexical rules,
following Lees's example, are treated together at the end (2.3) Overlapping in membership between lexical classes has been freely admitted.
I n the translation of examples, a morpheme by morpheme rendering has been provided
where the correspondence of xjp to English morphemes is not reasonably clear. Ahhreviations of very frequent function words have been used to prevent the translation from
becoming too bulky, and are explained the first time they are used. I n literal translations,
hyphens unite two-morpheme equivalents of asingle Ijp morpheme: e.g. deril 'laugh-at'.
I n writing rules, conventions which have become established in transformational
grammar are for the most part used. T h e symbols are listed below.
X is replaced by Y.
X+Y
X is optionally present, Y is obligatorily present.
(X) y2.1.1 T h e initial symbol S (sentence) is usually rewritten as noun phrase (NP) followed
by ~redicate(P), but there are two minor sentence types consisting of a vocative (Voc)
and an interjection (Inj), both of which are accompanied by exclamatory intonationI.","[19, 20]"
"PHONOLOGYA G R A M M A R O F T H E K O L O K U M A D I A L E C T O F I10(a) A very large number of ideophones are reduplicated (e.g. geengeenz 'shrill') or
even triplicated (e.g. I&lalaz'pure white'). I n a language where the distribution of vowels
is limited by vowel harmony and the distribution of consonants by statistical prohabilities, some reduplication would be expected and occurs (e.g. in reduplicated nouns like
e16rnulernb4 'well'). I t is, however, much more marked among the ideophones than in
other parts of the vocabulary. Out of 392 ideophones examined, 190 (48.4%) were reduplicated, 19 (48%) were triplicated, and 183 (46.6%) were neither. By contrast, on
the Swadesh zoo-word list, only seven forms (3.5%) were reduplicated and none was
triplicated; of units other than ideophones beginning with k, 7.80/, were duplicated
and none was triplicated.
(b) A much greater proportion of ideophones than of other units contain the same
vowcl throughout; this fact is particularly striking because idcophones, on the whole,
contain more syllables (and therefore more vowels) than other units. Of 158 forms on the
Swadesh zoo-word list which contained more than one vowel, 40 (about 25%) had the
same vowel throughout; of 385 ideophones with more than one vowel, 187 (about 48%)
had the same vowcl throughout.
(c) A much greater proportion of ideophones than of other units contain phonetically
long vowcls. Of the 3gz ideophones studied, 107, or roughly z5%, had a long
vowel; of non-ideophones beginning with k, only three, or about z:/,, contained a
long vowel.
(d) The most interesting property of ideophones is their tendency to cluster in groups.
Each member of the group differs only slightly from the other members, both phonologically and semantically:
geen4
geen4
goon4of an even, unblinking light; whence egengenl 'firefly'
of a steady light, brighter than geen4
of a light which is brighter than geen4, but does not bother one likegoon4of a light which is brighter than geen4 or geen4.geen4With these should he compared gegenegpgene4 'of someone with wilful, flashing eyes'
and ganl 'be light', possibly the starting point for the whole series, which is not itsbf an
ideophone.
T h e above example is typical in showing the main phonological variation borne by the
vowels. Of the threc dimensions in which vowels contrast, one is regularly and two
sporadically associated with a regular semantic distinction. Pairs of ideophones which
differ only in that one has close and the other open vowels refer to larger and smaller
objects respectively. Somewhat less consistently, non-high vowels refer to larger objects
than high ones, and back vowels to larger objects than front ones. These distinctions will
be illustrated from one particularly complete series, referring to the size and shape of a
man. Although there was some variation among informants in such a set, in that some
speakers would not accept all the forms given by others, all of them accepted several of
the series.

people than1.5.2 I n view of these special features of ideophones, it might be expected that they
would show a peculiar distribution of consonants. I t does in fact appear that the frequency of certain individual consonants is different in ideophones: there are more ideophones than other units with initial kp, although ideophones constitute only about a
fifth of the collected vocabulary. But in terms of the overall distribution of plosives,
fricatives and sonorants, ideophones do not differ markedly from the rest of the vocabulary, and the figures for ideophones and other units have therefore not been distinguished
in 1.4.4-5.
1.6 TONEMES
I .6.1 There are two tonemes, ' high and ' low. Their allotones are described in relation
to syllables and breath groups; the tone patterns they form, however, are to he described
in terms of units, which in turn form tone groups and tone phrases (cf. 1.7 and 7.1-2).
Every vowel and unit-initial nasalization bears a tone. Tone marks are not written on
every syllable; instead, the following conventions are observed:
(a) Tones are marked in relation to tone phrases, which are separated by comma and
sentence juncture (i.e. by punctuation marks).
(b) Within a tone phrase, unmarked syllables at the beginning are low.
(c) The first high syllable in a tone phrase is marked high, the next low syllable is
marked low, etc.
(d) All unmarked syllables following a marked one hear the same tone as the marked
one.
(e) Units cited in isolation bear a subscript numeral assigning them to a morphophonemic tone class (1.7) if they ever occur initially in a tone phrase. They are marked with
the tone pattern they hear in this initial position.
(f) Other units cited in isolation are preceded by hyphen juncture; the tone patterns
marked on them are those they most frequently bear (1.7).
1.6.2 The following are the allotones of the high and low tonemes:
(a) I n the breath group, the first sequence of high tones is higher than the second, the
second than the third, etc., unless a sequence later than the first is raised for emphasis:
'he is not well';
each succeeding high tone is slightly lower than the preceding one.
eri, qng4, kyro-5A GRAMMAR O F T H E KOLOI<UMA DIALECT OF TI9(b) A final low tone in a breath group is lowcr than the earlier low tones. If the breath
group ends in two low tones on adjacent vowels (i.e. with no intervening consonant), they
are phonetically realized as a low-falling tone:
-imp? simple past tense before reported speech
(c) A high+a low tone on adjacent vowels result in a phonetic high-falling tone:
om6b4 sweat
(d) A low+a high tone on adjacent vowels result in a phonetic low-rising tone:
sanjj melt (intransitive)1.6.3 Stress is predictable. It falls:
(a) On the first of a series of high tones:
of6niz [3f6ni] bird
(b) On the first part of a phonetically falling tone:
om6b4 [6'm8ii] sweat
(c) On the first part of a phonetically rising tone, unless the vowcl of the first part is
high and the vowcl of the second non-high, in which case the second part is stressed:
but
ndai4 [h'dt]
so, then

(d) On the first syllable of a unit of shape W:

['&I
interrogative emphasizer
There is a distinct tendency towards a rhythm which is, in Pike's terms,4 neither
syllable-timed nor stress-timed. Tone groups tend to occupy roughly equal intervals of
time; a subject at the beginning of the sentence forming its own tone group is often
spoken slowly and followed by a slight pause, whereas the predicate which follows i t and
forms at least one new tone group is normally longer than the subject but, being spoken
faster, takes little more time to say. I n
jnqy-s+, gridugudu-k(i) 6mi 'the wound is very deep',
the four syllables of the subject (up to the comma) take roughly the same length of time
as the six syllables of the predicate (the i of -ki is elidcd).
I .7 TONE
PATTERNS1.7.1 Tone patterns extend over tone phrases, which are built u p from tone groups,
which in turn are built u p from units. T h e tone patterns borne by units in isolation are
frequently completely changed when the unit occurs in non-initial position in the tone
group, and sometimes partly changed even when the unit occurs in initial position. For
example, there are three nouns which in isolation have the following patterns:
bur6 yam
biri ward, quarter
war/ house.
Initially in a tone group the first of these has a different tone pattern while others do
not changc:
wiri-bi
buru-bi
biri-bi
the quarter
the house
the yam
I n non-initial position any of the nouns can have any of the four possible combinations
of high and low tone, depending on what precedes:

Three pronouns, the second person singular and plural, and the third person singular

to these base patterns are given in chapter 7. Types I and 6 are cited without a base tone
pattern, because type I is largely and type 6 wholly conditioned by what precedes. (Type

"1 . 3 . 2 There is no contrast between nasalized and oral vowels after a nasal consonant;
all are somewhat nasalized. T h e kymograph does not show any consistent diffcrence,
in so far as any direct comparison of such data is possihle~between this non-distinctive
nasalization and the distinctive one discussed above. T h e auditory impression is that
vowels following m are more nasalized than those following n q; back vowels are more
nasalized than front, and i i least of all. This impression gains a little support from the
admittedly inconsistent local orthography, but the kymograph record does not show any
significant difference between the nasalization of vowels in these various environments.

"Ikeni idika, a rnQ e r i - d y !
it is a hyena she has seen!)1.0.5 T h e term UNIT was suggested by Rowlands' TONAL UNIT;as used here, however,
it is a unit for phoneme distribution, vowel harmony and nasalization as well as for tone.
Units usually coincide with morphemes (k6roa 'fall'); the few exceptions consist of units
where two or more morphemes are recognizable but do not function individually in
respect of tone (k6rorn~z'make fall, throw': k6ro2 'fall'+ =rn? 'causative'). Because of
these few cases, the term M O R P H E ~has been kept as a grammatical one and is not used
on the phonological level. Since the grammar does not distinguish morphology and
syntax, the term WORD has not been required at the grammatical levcl and is therefore
used at the phonological level only.
1.0.6 T h e term TONE GROUP is equivalent to Rowlands' TONAL GROUP and is preferred
only as being slightly simpler. Tone groups are of crucial importance for the description

certain circumstances they are linked into larger sequences, for which the tcrm TONE

and low tongue position; the high and mid vowels also contrast as to front and backT ~ L2E

"-1.4.3 Consonants are distributed in syllables and units. T h e great majority of Kolokuma syllables can be summarized in the formula'I'
(C) V (N),
where C=consonant, V=vourel, T=tone, N=nasalization, and parentheses indicate
optional clcments. A few syllab!es do not fit this formula:
(a) As noted in 1.3.1, some unit-initial syllables consist of nasalization+tone.
(b) A few syllables end in a consonant; units containing such syllables are loanwords,
ideophones or interjections :
baptiizi4
baptize
dibdibdib4 freshly-cut and oozing
cry to shoo fowls
6s os
(c) A few units beginning with voiceless plosive+high vowel+ r have variants without
the vou,cl: pjrjl or pril 'give'. Such forms are probably dialect borrowings from NorthWestern Ij?, and the longer form is used throughout this study.
1.4.4 T h e distribution of consonants within the unit is not regulated as rigidly as that
of the vowels, but it is statistically though not absolutely limited. Table 4 shows what
combinations of first and second consonant (CI and Cz) were found in a tabulation of
559 units, each of which contained two consonants. (The first consonant may he either
initial or preceded by a vowel.)PHONOLOGYA GRAMMAR O F T H E K O L O K U M A D I A L E C T O F TJQPHONOLOGYA combination of the total occurrences of each consonant in C1 and Cz position yields
the results that are shown in Table 5,which give a rough idea of the lexical frequency&ble consonant combinations were quite regular and could be stated as rules and not
as fr~quencies.But there are two reasons why this is unlikely. Firstly, languages are
rarely, if ever, in a state of complete equilibrium; borrowing from other dialects and
languages is not likely to he a necessarily new feature of I<olokuma. Secondly, although
in the example above six out of twelve cases of fricative-plosive were stated to he of
recent origin, at least one of the others has to be assigned to Proto-Ijo. Further, other
show that the number of fricative-plosive combinations has actually been
reduced by conditioned sound-change. I t therefore seems improbable that there was ever
rigid a limitation on consonant combinations as there is on vowels.
1.4.5 A comparatively small number of Kolokuma units contain more than two
consonants. Of the polysyllables that do occur, the greater number belong to the syntactic
class of ideophones or descriptive verbs, which will he specially considered in 1.5below.
For the present they will he treated like other polysyllables, except that in the case of
reduplicated forms only the first half of the unit is considered.
206 units, each containing three consonants, were examined. 27 combinations of
*losive, fricative and sonorant are possible, and the number of units taking each combination is shown in Table 7.of the various consonants. (The text frequency has not been studied.)T ~ L5BczCombmedc1r 140

It is clear from this example that the main factor determining the tone pattern of the
group is its initial unit. UNITSHAVE THEREFORF BEEN ASSIGNED TO MORPHOPIXONXMIC
TONE CLASSES ON THE BASIS OF HOW THEY AFFECT THE UNITS THAT FOLLOW THEM IN THETONE GROUP. T h e tone class of a unit is discovered only by noting the tone pattern of
the group when the unit is in initial position, for its isolation tones are often ambiguous.
In the example above, biri and w5ri have the same isolation tones, but they have a
different effect on following units and are therefore assigned to different morphophonemic
tone classes :
biri-otu
wiri-otb
people of a quarter people of a house
Conversely, not all units assigned to the same morphophonemic tone class have the same
isolation tone: biri and a m i 'town' differ in their isolation tone hut havc the same effect
on following units :
biri-otu
ami-otu
people of a quarter people of a town.
When a unit is cited, therefore, it is marked both with the tone pattern i t bears when
initial in a tone group (this being taken as the base form) and with a subscript numeral
assigning i t to one of five morphophonemic tone classes: b u r u ~ ,biriz, am&, ~ i r / ~ .
The number of minimal pairs distinguished only by tone is relatively small. If this
were not so, there would be a great deal of ambiguity when these units occurred in noninitial position and their tone patterns were determined by what preceded. There is,
however, one very important group of units, several of which are distinguished only by
tone. These are the pronouns; and it is interesting that they are limited to initial position
in the tone group. T h e short pronouns provide a particularly good example of the
peculiarities of the Kolokuma system. T h e first and second pcrsons singular differ only
by tone class; the tone of the pronouns themselves is low in both cases, but the syllable
following the pronoun is low after the first person and high after the second:
i-piri
give me
i-plri
give you.
The same situation occurs with the second and third persons plural:
q-pjrj give them
?-pjri
give you (pl).
Ambiguity would obviously be intolerable if pronouns occurred outside the position of
maximum distinction.",[17]
"7.1 TON^ GROUPS
7.1.0 T h e tone pattern of a tone group is very largely affected by the tone class of the
initial unit of the group. T h e rules of the first set are therefore grouped partly according
to the tone class of the first unit of the group. T h e tone pattern of the group is also
affected by a number of other factors, such as the occurrence in certain positions of the
various types of enclitics and finals, so that there is some complexity in the rules.
As in the preceding chapter, only the middle part of the left-hand side of the rule,
enclosed between commas, is rewritten on the right. Except in M.68, however, the
symbols X and Y are not used to show the wider environment, but have other uses. A
list of symbols used in these rules follows.
# Tone group boundary (in first set of rules); tone phrase boundary (in second set of
rules). This symbol could have been introduced much earlier, but was postponed i n
the interests of clarity. It occurs between any two units neither united by f nor
separated by sentence juncture (i.e. a punctuation mark). (Sentence juncture resembles
# i n ma&ng the end of a tone group for the first set of rules, but differs from it i n
that i t cannot be deleted to allow the linking of tone groups into tone phrases.)

Apart from the special case of the pronoun sub~ects,linking takes place only when the

MORPHOPHONEMICS 11: T O N E AND E L I S I O N
7.0 It was explained in 1.7.1 that there are extensive morphotonemic changes that
geatly affect the tone patterns of individual units. These changes will now be described
in three ordered sets of rules. T h e first set deals with the tone pattern within the tone
group; that is, with the tone pattern within stretches whose units have until the present
been linked by plus signs (+). T h e second set unites certain of the tone groups into
longer tone phrases, the conditions for this linking being purely tonal. T h e third set
introduces intonational modifications into the tone phrases.
Finally, there is a set of rules dealing with vowel elision and tone elision resulting
therefrom.",[51]

At each previous stagc rewriting has been necessary because the next set of rules depended
on the previous rewriting, hut since no further set of rules depends on the last one,
rewriting is unnecessary. 'rile examples illustrating each rule will thcrefore be enclosed

ELISIONrefers to the loss of one or more phonemes or prosodemes from a sequence;
REPLACEMENT to the partial or total assimilation of a final vowcl to the initial vowel of
the next unit. Consonants and tones are only elided; vowels are first replaced and then
sometimes elided.

sentence serving as a noun modifier is either a short pronoun or a possessive. (When not
preceding a demonstrative, only a possessive is possible: M.6-7.)

form from phrase-structure rules. On the left, each string begins with X and ends with
Y; in between are the elements which are to be rewritten, marked off by commas, and
next to them the relevant environment. On the right-hand side only the central part,
corresponding to the portion which on the left is betwecn commas, is rewritten; the
environment, which does not change, is to be read as identical with its statement on the
left. Extra unspecified elements in the environment, when required, are noted as X', etc.

omitting tonal rules, which are dealt with in the last chapter.

"6.1 PRONOUNS
6.1.1 When pronominalized nouns are preceded by modifiers, they are replaced by
MODIFIED PRONOUNS: -ye (inanimate), - b q (masculine), -aray (feminine). Two of these,
-ye and -aray, are related in form to iyez 'thing' and iri(i4 'she'; the third one, -b?,
does not occur elsewhere. Setting up the class of modified pronouns therefore accounts
for the limited distribution of -lqand, and, by allowing the occurrence of pronouns
after modifiers, removes a restriction on their distribution.

"A G R A M M A R O F T H E K O L O K U M A D I A L E C T O F IJOhand. Westermann did not publish evidence supporting his tentative 1927 classification
of I j p as Kwa, and the idea was dropped until recently suggested again by Greenberg.
In the interval, Ijp has been classed so as to stress its isolation. M . Delafosse in Mcillet
et Cohen, LES LANGUES DU MONDE (Paris, 1952), classifies Ijp as the sole member of a
'groupe bas-nigtrien'. His cited material is from Nembe, and he misinterprets the
definite articles and other affixes as evidence of a noun-class system, an error carried over
into Westermann and Bryan's LANGUAGS OF WEST AFRICA (Oxford, 1952), where Ij? is
treated in the chapter on class languages.
0.3.2 Since no general description of any ijo dialect has yet been published, it was
decided that an outline of the wholc system of one dialect, Kolokuma, would he more
useful than a description of a single aspect of the language. Before dealing specifically
with Kolokuma, some of the more unusual features of Tjp as a whole, and a few general
comparisons of ijp with other Niger-Congo languages, will be briefly indicated.
Tjp stands sharply distinguished from neighbouring languages in its complex system of
tonal morphophonemics and intonational modifications of tone patterns, described in
detail for IColokuma in Chapter 7. It is suggested by Gleason that a system of this type,
where word-tones are subordinated to larger tone patterns, marks a language which is,
historically, changing from a tonal t o a pitch-accent or purely intonational system
(LANGUAGE
37.300,1961). Most Niger-Congo languages are tonal, but some have lost their
tones: e.g. several West Atlantic languages, and Swahili in the Bantu group. T h e immediate neighbours of rj?, however, are all clearly tonal; some of them, such as Yoruba, have
a three-tone system, whcreas the original Ij? system seems to have had only two tones,
like Proto-Bantu.
Ijp has little morphology, but what there is contains several notcworthy features. I t has
lost the original Niger-Congo noun-class system, and few relics of it remain even as
meaningless vowel prefixes (as they do, for example, in Yoruba and Igbo). On the other
hand, it has a system of delinitc articles sutIixed to thc noun, apparently developed from
demonstratives. It is unusual, among Niger-Congo languages, in having a separatc
feminine pronoun, demonstrative and delinite article; some dialccts, though not Kolokuma, also have a neuter.
I n word-order, modifiers consistently precede heads and the object precedes the verb.
T h e most interesting syntactic feature is the verb phrase, which may contain a scries of
verb roots. Many 'Kwa' languages have a similar feature; Westermann has described it
in his GRAMMATIK DER EWE-SPRACHE (Berlin, 1907), Ida Ward in her INTRODUCTION TO
THE YO~IUBA LANGUAGE (Cambridge, 1952), and W. E. Welmers in his DESCRIPTIVE
G R A ~ X A ROF FANTI (Baltimore, 1946). I n Kolol~umathere arc, in many cases, no connecting or subordinating grammatical morphemes to show the relationship of the different
verb roots to one another, so that a good deal of experimenting is necessary to discover
the permissible combinations. Chapter 3 contains the results of these investigations.
OF KOLOKUMA
0.4 THESPEAKERS
T h e present study is a descriptive analysis of a single ijp dialect, Kolokuma, particularly
as it is spoken in the town of Iiaiama. Speakers call their language jzQn bell 'Ijp language'
or k6lolchmi bell 'Kolokuma dialect'. Members of the Iiolokuma-Opokuma clan live in
ten towns along the River Nun, from Igbedi to Odi. T h e men trade, fish, cut palmfruit
and do some farming; many leave home to work in Lagos, Ghana and elsewhere, often
as cooks, stewards, sailors or policemen. Most men and many women, therefore, speakINTRODUCTIONsome English or Pidgin, and often one or more other African languages - Igbo, Yoruba
Hausa; G5 or Fanti; even (in the case of an ex-serviceman) Swahili. T h e women do
of the farming and some fishing, as well as their household duties. Some Kolokuma
men marry Isoko or Aboh wives, and small communities of Isokos, forming their own
villages, live in the area to cut palmfluit. Most children attend the primary schools run
by the Church Missionary Society, where they learn English. For all education beyond
the primary level young people must go away from home, so that the area is constantly
being drained of its most intelligent and ambitious members. Geographical isolation
ensures that, while many Kolokumas leave their home town, not many outsiders come in;
there are usually more women than men in a town.","[6, 7]"

This monograph is a revised version of my Ph.D, dissertation, accepted by Yale University in 1963. Its history is largely a record of those to whom I am indebted. It is impossible to name them all in a brief preface; equally impossible for the work to appear
without thanks to the few who are named below and the many who have also contributed.
I first begall work on the I<olokuma dialect of Ijo in 1957 under the guidance of the
late Mr. H. J. Uldall, Senior Lecturer in Phonetics at the University of Ibadan, while
I held a Leverhulme Research Scholarship, and have continued at intervals ever since.
My field work has constantly been made pleasant by the interest and co-operation of the
Ijo people; among many others, I would like to mention Chief G. D. Appah and Mr.
J. H. B. Appah for their hospitality in Kaiama; 1Ur. S. K. Owonaro for his encouragement and comments on the phonology; Mr. Dagbo Alazigha for the use of his lists of
numerals. Those who have chiefly assisted me in the study of I<olokuma are named in
0.5.'; of them, Mr. A. A. Akene (now a student at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka),
Mr. 0. A. Egberipou, Mr. Pianto Egberipou (now at the University of Lagos Medical
School), and Mr. A. 0. Timitimi have borne the greatest part. Mr. J. C. Daworiye of
Odi, a student at the University of Ife, has helped in the revision for publication. The
willingness and interest of all my assistants have been a constant encouragemelit in the
work.
This grammar of Kolokuma began to take its PI-csent form when I was a student in
the Linguistics Department of Yale University. I am iudebted to Professor Bernard
Bloch and the whole Departme& for the atmosphere which allowed me to follow up my
own lines of interest. As regards my dissertation, I am particularly grateful to Professor
Samuel E. Martin, who supervised my wol-k and encouraged its progress, to Professor
Rulon S. Wells for his course on syntax, and to Professor I, Dyen for a better understanding of lexicostatistics.
My attempt to write a generative-transformational grammar stems from the interest
that I felt in the work of Noam Chomsky and others. I t seemed that certain features of
Ijg (such as the relation of the tone system to the syntax) might be interestingly described
by such methods. I have not, however, studied under transformationalists, and am well
aware that the grammar would be different if I had.
From the American Council for Learned Societies I received an Advanced Graduate
Fellowship in Linguistics, which enabled me to return to Nigeria for further fieldwork
and to write my dissertation there. To the Department of Linguistics and Nigerian
Languages, University of Ibadan, I am grateful for facilities for writing up the dissertation.
In the revision which preceded publication, I have had the benefit of much help from
Professor PaulSchachter, as a result of which the syntactic and morphophonemic rules
have been almost completely recast. The infelicities which remain are entirely my own
responsibility.
IBADANviiINTRODUCTION
0.1 Jjy (1jaw)l is a language spoken over a wide area in southern Nigeria. T h e Ijyspeaking peoples live mainly in Degema and Yenagoa Provinces in the Eastern Region
and in the Western Ijaw Division of Delta Province in the Midwest Region, with a few
outlying groups stretching as far west as Okitipupa Division in the Western Region. T h e
exact number of speakers is not known, but there are probably at lcast half a million.2
T h e area inhabited by Ijy-speakers forms part of the Niger Delta. T h e land is intersected by rivers and creeks; transport is often easier by water than by land. Conscquently
lines of communication tend to run u p and down stream, roughly from north to south,
rather than from east to west, except in the coastal creeks. T h e inland parts of the delta
are fertile, as the silt brought down by the Niger in the flood season (roughly, July to
Octoher) is deposited on the farmland; but the parts nearer the ocean and towards the
east are tidal, and little vegetation except mangroves flourishes in the salt water.
T h e economy of the salt-water area depends on fishing and on trading. From the
fifteenth to the late nineteenth century, the Eastern Jjy speakers developed city-states and
acted as middlemen between European traders on the coast and the peoples living in the
interior; contact with Europeans is, therefore, no novelty to Jjp peoples. 146th European
penetration of the interior, and particularly with direct access to the palm oil producing
areas, the Ijy monopoly of trade collapsed.3 T h e fresh-water areas were never so dependent on trade, relying mainly, as they still do, on agriculture supplemented by fishing.
Nowadays, the whole area suffers from lack of roads and industry, and has been classified
by the Nigerian Government as a Special Development Area. T h e discovery of oil in
various parts of the delta offers at least limited opportunities for employment to the
inhabitants of the area.","[1, 2, 3, 4]"
"DIALECTS
The Ijy language is considerably differentiated into dialects, which form what C. F.
Hockett calls an L-complex (A COURSE IN MODERN LINGUISTICS,
323-4; New York, 1958).
A preliminaly dialect survey has been made, but the results have not yet been fully
analysed; the classification which follows is therefore a tentative one.
Each dialect is at least partially intelligible with several others, but those from the
extreme east of the Ijy area are not mutually intelligible with those from the west. Two
main groups of dialects, Eastern and Central, are distinguished. Eastern dialects are
spoken in the eastern part of the salt-water area, where the development of trade drew
people into larger and more centralized political units; their dialects became more sharply
differentiated than those of the less-centralized fresh-water area. T h e two main groups
of dialects are subdivided as follows:
0.2I. EASTERN
A. South-Eastern:
I . Ralabari, spoken in Abonnema, Buguma, Bakana, Tombia, and their villages.
'Other spellings in the literature are U d ~ o Idsp,
,
Idzd, Idzo, Idjo, Djo, UJo,Ija, Ijoh, Ijg, Ijo.
a The 1952 census figures of 294,941 are almost certainly an underestimate.

4.2.4 Where there is no common noun phrase between the two sentences, there are
three types of nominalization that replace y6z 'thing' in the matrix sentence. Verbs of
the group Vnom have two possibilities; they are nominalized either directly by taking
the d e h i t e or indefinite marker, or by adding baras 'way'. The first type of nominalization is often equivalent to an English abstract noun or an -ing form, the second to 'the
way X did Y'. Other verbs, of the group Vbara, can only addbaras, which for them acts
as a simple nominalizer. Finally, verbs are nominalized by the addition of yQ-bj 'the
fact that' (lit. 'the place'). There are limitations on the verbs that follow such nominalizations, but these have not been studied.
