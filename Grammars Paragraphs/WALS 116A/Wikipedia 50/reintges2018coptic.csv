Yes/no questions are interrogdegree of truth of the questioned proposition and can appropriatelyanswered by the equivalents of the words yes and no in English. There ;two varieties of yes/no questions in Coptic: those that are introduced byag ‘what (kind)’(N-26), ¢.g. NTAKEItypically used when the condition of participants or non-participants of
speech situation is at issue, e.g. agpo! ANOK MN P@MEe ‘what aboutagpo= ‘what about, how come’Unlike other interrogative expressions, agpo= is positionally restricted to

"Yes/no questionsCoptic yes/no questions comein two varieties, viz. with or without a.dedicated question particle (see above, section 4.2.2 of Unit 4). In the
latter group, Second Tense morphology provides a cue for the
interrogative interpretation of the clause within its scope, e.g.

‘will’ you go (€-kK-Na-Bwk) and leave me (N-r-Kaa-T) in (gn) these
punishments (NeI-Koaacic)?’ (Ac. A&P 202:118). Second Tenses can,
however, not be analyzed as lexicalised question cues for two reasons.
Firstly, Second Tenses appear in clause types other than interrogative
sentences,forinstance,inrelativeclausesanddeclarativesentence, €.g. Mm €ITAIHY ANOK Ezoye TAxoelc ‘am J more

in table 7.1: Second Tenses are derived from “basic” First Tenses by
adding a relative marker in front of the verbal cluster. This system of
concatenative operations is organized around a marked value, representedfocusconstructions. Secondly, it is possible to have Second Tenses and
dedicated question particles like mun within the same interrogative

b)Wh-in-situ questionsCoptic has several interrogative patterns for constituent or wh-questions.
In so-called wh-in-situ questions, the questioned constituent is placed
in exactly the same syntactic position as in its declarative counterpart. As
we can see from the following set of data, Coptic wh-in-situ questions
demonstrate a straightforward correlation between the clause-internal
. position of the question word and the presence of this special kind ofnflectional morphology. In other words, wh-in-situ does not come for
fre 2 but | requires the presence ‘of Second: Tense marking to be
grammatical. Furthermore, there are no asymmetries between questionedSecond Tenses are not restricted to inter
rogative sentences, but may al
appear in a range of declarative focus
contexts. Question-answer pa
have been widely used as diagnostic
tools for focushood: the focusarguments and adjuncts in wh-in-situ questions.","[135, 136]"
"4.2.2.1 Unmarked yes/no questions”Unmarked yes/no questions take exactly the same form as
corresponding declarative clauses, e.g, ara EpwaN OYZOTE WOMEoYwTINWYTTwaKpgoTegwawK ‘Abba (ama),if (epwan)|

nominal subject undergoes inversion to the clause-final position, while its
base-position is occupied by a co-referential subject pronoun, ¢.g. eqTwNn
irragoc Mrmaxoeic ‘where (is) (Twn) the tomb (m-radoc) of my lord

“Sounds and spellingcaneNn,‘This Unit addresses two interrelated topics: one concerns the CoptoGreek alphabet, i.e. the notation system in which Coptic texts have
‘been codified, and the other concems its sound system, or phonology.
‘Section 1.1 discusses the main aspects of Coptic orthography, while
‘section 1.2 presents several types of evidence for the pronunciation of a
4particular letter or gtapheme. There is not always a one-to-one
correspondence between graphemes and phonemes, since some
‘phonemes may be expressed by more than one grapheme and, vice
‘versa, some graphemes may have more than one phonological
‘interpretation, Section 1.3 is about suprasegmental phonology, i.e. the
‘phonological structure beyond the individual sounds or phonemes, with
particular attention for vowel length, syllable structure, and stress
-|placement.
. Section 1.4 addresses the question of language contact and linguistic
borrowing. The Coptic word stock has a considerable Greek
{jcomponent. The transfer of Greek lexical material was not confined to
{content words, such as nouns, verbs and adjectives, but also mvolved a
‘tconsiderable amount of function words, such as sentence conjunctions,discourse markers, mannerand time adverbials,and evensomeprepositions. The variant spelling of Copto-Greek loan words not only
reflects ongoing sound changes in the source language Koine Greek,
but also the absence of certain phonological oppositions in the
borrowing language Coptic Egyptian.","[17, 18]"

a)Anaphoric useProximal demonstrative pronouns as an alternative for personal pronoun:
when a discourse participant is mentioned for the second time, e.g. (ther
was a Samaritan woman in the city Alexandria) Tar Ac NeyenN OYNONgw[Ne]gn Tecare‘(as for) her (Tat), there was (Ne-yen) a seriou(oynoo)illness (N-wwne)in (gn) her head(rec-are)’(Mena,Mi26a:13-16), NTA Tal rap arrel NOy2WE NTOOT Tapa NrequT@a ‘fc

alTe1) something (oy-zgws) from me (NTooT) beyond (mapa) his merit
(meq-uTaga)’ (V. Pach. 140:15-16),EIXIS, INTERROGATION, QUANTIFICATIONDemonstrative pronouns may assume a recapitulative function, refering
back to the previous stretch of discourse, €.g.a TAI wre MMot ‘this (i.e.
the fall from the throne) (mai) happened (wwrre) to me (mMo-1)’ (Eud.
36:7-8),ETBETatexewwne2NNTApTAPOCWATEZOOY137(-pwre) that (eT-) (is) over there (mmay)’). It functions both as a
postnominal modifier and as a demonstrative pronoun. Thus, consider:

event with respect to the present moment
furnishes three absolute tenses: the present, the
past and the future. While the present locates an event at the present moment, the past locates it
prior and the future subsequent to the temporal
reference point.

"Nominal sentencesThis Unit completes our survey of the nominal domain by taking <
closer look at the Coptic equivalents of sentences like John is a
physician, where the indefinite noun phrase a physician does not refer
to any particular individual, but rather predicates something about the
subject John, namely his profession as a medical doctor. Such
sentences are called nominal sentences, since they contain a noun
phrase that is used predicatively.
Coptic nominal sentences are peculiar in two ways. First, they are
verbless constructions in the present tense, i.e. they lack a verbalcopula corresponding to English be. Thus, one class of nominal
sentences is formed by juxtaposition of a personal pronoun and an
indefinite noun phrase in predicative function, e.g. anr oyna ‘]
(anr) (am) a ghost (oy-mNa)’ (Onnophr. 206:19). The syntax and
semantics of such bipartite nominal sentences are the topic of section
5.1. Second, there is another type of nominal sentences, which contain
an extra pronominal element besides the subject and the nominal
predicate, e.g. aNOK Ne NwHpe mmNOyTe ‘I (aNoR) (am) the son
(n-wupe) of God (u-n-NoyTe)’ (Abbatén 240:13). As will be shown
in section 5.2, the added pronoun ne in such tripartite nominal
sentences has no anaphoric role (i.e. it does not refer to previously
mentioned discourse participants), but rather fulfils a purely
grammatical function as an agreement clitic, which links the subject to
the nominal predicate.
Nominal sentences have a relatively transparent syntax with only a
limited degree of word order variation. Yet, a broad spectrum ofso be found“poniinapredicate chosen. This Unit follows a taxonomic approach, where the

Coptic has two morphologically distinct sets of pronominal clitics. One
consists of the phonologicaily reduced and deaccented proclitic forms
of the independent first and second person pronouns, to wit anr (<
aNok) ‘J’, nTK ‘you (man)’ (<< NTOK), NTE “you (woman)’ (< NTO),
an(N) ‘we’ (< ANON), NTETN ‘you (plural)’ (<< Nrwtn). The other set
of pronouns consists of the enclitic deictic pronouns ne ‘he’, Te ‘she’
ne ‘thcy’. These are used as suppletive pronominal forms in, the
context of third person reference, since there are no proclitic variants.of the freestanding third person pronouns (see above, section 2.4.3.1 of

"7.1.3 TAM-markers as auxiliary verbs
A question remains with respect to the categorial status of Coptic tenseaspect-mood (TAM) markers: are they free functional morphemes or
rather auxiliary verbs? The clause-initial or medial position of TAM
markers, their morphological independence from the verb, as well as
their agreement behaviour (variant forms for nominal and pronominal
subjects, for instance, gape and qa- in the Habitual Present) provide
prima facie evidence for their syntactic status as auxiliary verbs.
Additional support for an auxiliary verb analysis of Coptic TAM
expressions comes from their compatibility with more than one syntactic
position. In the following example, there are two instances of the
Habitual Present, one in front of the left-dislocated topic constituent and
the other in front of the resumptive subject pronoun, e.g. ayw qwape
Moya Moya MMOOY WAqAICEANE KaTa Teqpycic ‘and (ayw) each one
(m-oya Hoya) of them (HH0-oy) perceives (wape ... Wa-q-aAlIC@ANe)ears, then, that Coptic TAM markers behave “syntactically
enerally,
like auxiliary verbs. Yet, due to their semantic erosion, these markershave a fully grammaticalised meaning and function and are used to
indicate various aspectual, temporal and modal categories. In this respect,they behave like inflectional elements distinct from the lexical category
“verb”,7.27.2.2 Syntactic distribution
First and Second Tenses have exactly the same temporal interpretation,
but differ systematically from each other with respect to their syntactic
distribution. Second Tenses replace pragmatically unmarked First Tenses
in a range of interrogative and declarative focus sentences.
a)First and Second TensesWith more than twenty different verb conjugations, the tense-aspectmood system constitutes one of the most complex areas of Coptic
grammar. At the foundation of this richness of morpho-semantic
distinctions is a subdivision of the absolute tenses into two conjugational
classes, traditionally referred to as First and Second Tenses. The
morphological derivation of Second Tenses will be dealt with in section
7.2.1. Section 7.2.2 surveys the main sentence constructions in which
Second Tenses are grammatically allowed or required.
7.2.1 A paradigmatic split in the absolute tense systemCoptic has four absolute tenses that describe present, past and future
situations: the Present, the Habitual, Perfect, and-the Future. These
absolute tenses come in pairs of so-called First and Second Tenses.","[134, 135]"
"The book consists of twelve units besides this introduction, which
together provide a complete description of Sahidic Coptic grammar.
Each unit discusses a sepatate grammatical topic and is accompanied
by a list of key terms and a series of exercises. To provide anof the
orientation to the organisation of the book, I present a summary
bows
contents of each unit:
eyUNIT1 dealswithSahidic orthographyandphonologywith_ particular attention for the correspondence between sounds and letters.
For dead languages like Coptic Egyptian, it is often difficult to gain
relevant information on suprasegmental phonology (syllable structure,
consonant clusters, accentuation), This unit reviews the available
evidence for Sahidic prosodic structure. Another topic concerns the
lexical transfer of borrowings from Greek into Coptic.
The first part of the grammar (units 2-5) explores the nominal
domain. UNIT 2 starts with the morphology of simple nouns and
pronouns. Coptic has «an impoverished noun derivation with the
prenominal determiner functioning as the morphological exponent of
grammatical number and gender. This contrasts with an elaborate
i pronominal system in which each person, number and gender
distinction correlates with a distinct pronominal form. Moreover, there
are three sets of pronouns (free pronouns, bound pronouns, and clitics),
which display a high degree of allomorphic variation.
UNIT 3 is about phrasal syntax. Coptic makes productive use of a
range of patterns to create complex noun phrases from simple nouns.
This unit surveys the most common types of nominal compounds,
adjectival modification, possessive noun phrases, noun coordination
and prepositional phrases, which have an essentially nominal syntax.
UNIT 4 takes a closer look at the rich deictic and quantificational
system of Sahidic Coptic. Most demonstratives assume different forms
depending on whether they function as prenominal determiners or
pronouns. The description of the deictic system focuses on. the
discourse functions of the various demonstrative pronouns and articles.
The remainder of this unit discusses the syntax and the semantics of
question words and quantificational expressions.
UNIT 5 is concerned with nominal sentences, so called because a
noun phrase is used as the main predicate. Nominal sentences have a
transparent syntax, consisting of two or three (pro)nominal
3ayy
icative relationships‘ap, identification, property assignment, and so forth).in twenty different verbal tenses, aspects, and moods,-inflectional system represents one of the most complex
areas of Sahidic grammar. The descriptive analysis of the tense-aspectmood system in the second part (units 6-9) thus constitutes the core ofthe book. UNIT 6 is concerned with the formation of verbal stemsfrom semantically and phonologically underspecified lexical items (socalled roots). Coptic stem formation encodes two dimensions of verbalmeaning: one dimension is situation aspect or “Aktionsart”, which
concerns the contrast between events, activities and processes on theone hand, and mental or physical states and conditions on the other.
Theotherdimensioniscase,objectivewhichtorefersthemorphological expression of the relationship between the verb and its
direct object. Coptic verb stems are not mflected for tense, aspect, andmood. All this information is encoded in a conjugation base, which
occurs independently of the verb as a free functional morpheme.","[16, 17]"
"10.1.1 S—V-O as the basic word order
In languages with relatively flexible word order, the
practical problem
arises as to how one can determine whether any
particular order is
basic. This section presents several diagnostic
s for identifyingword order patterns are derived.
a);Precedence relationsS-V-—O order can be established as the basic word
order on syntacticgrounds,sincethisis theorderthatreflectsthebasicstructural
relations between the verb and its arguments. Copti
c is a head-initiallanguage, where the verb precedes the direct
and the indirectobject.
Moreover, most tense-aspect-mood inflections
appear clause-initially
in front of the subject. Since the TAM marke
r precedes both the
subject and the verb, and the verb precedes the
object, the subject must
also precede the direct object, €.8. A OYCON xNE

morphological marking. As we will see in sections 11.1.3 to 11.1.5,
both left-dislocation and subject inversion re present syntactically more
marked options than canonical

subject role of the dislocated nominal constituent, a pronominal
placeholder must be inserted in the preverbal subject slot. Moreover,
inverted subject nouns are morphologically marked by means of the
focus marker noi. Compare, then: (s —-V-O) A NZA,0 xooc xe (...)
