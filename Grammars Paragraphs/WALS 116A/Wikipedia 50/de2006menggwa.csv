"Saturday morning die-3MSG-PAST:FOC
‘He died on Saturday morning.’On the other hand, past tense with focus -hya tends not to be used in polarity
questions and answers to polarity questions as there is no focused consituents.
Polarity questions are mostly answered simply with ini ‘yes’ or awe ‘no’ (§3.2.9).
However, if a finite past tense verb is used in the answer, the verb is most usually
marked with -hwa.6-44. a. hihiri-mbo homba-i-Ø-hwa?

‘Did you see him stealing?’ (hihiri ‘steal’ class I; homba ‘see’ class II)b. ini homba-i-Ø-hwa.[? homba-i-Ø-hya]yes see-N1SG-3MSG:O-PAST
‘Yes, I saw him (stealing).’Of course -hya is not only used in answers; -hya is also often found in
narrative clauses. When a piece of new information is presented, it is normal for the
verb to be marked with -hya if the sentence is in past tense.",[369]

(sefi (sa-/ da-) ‘give’ class III)The past tense with focus suffix -hya signifies that a constituent of the clause
or the whole clause is in focus. The focused constituent most usually represents new
information. The function of -hya can be clearly demonstrated in content questions
and answers to content questions; -hya is used in such clauses because there is
always a focused constituent which seeks or provides new information. It is also
grammatical for content questions and answers to be marked with -hwa instead of -hya; -hwa is simply indifferent to — rather than negating — the fact that something
is focused in the clause. Nevertheless, -hya is much more common with content
questions, and answers to content questions are also nearly always marked with -hya.

function as a predicate on its own, unlike awe (§3.2.9).6-76. gihalfi sufwa-afa-mbio awe?hunger feel-2SG-PRES:STAT or not

Future tentative mood verb forms can also be used for questions in futuretense. We have seen that future declaratives are expressed by semi-realis verb forms
(§6.2). Future interrogatives, however, must be in irrealis status. The future
tentative verb form is used for both content questions (question word questions) and
polarity questions (yes-no questions). The following are some examples of content
questions in future tense.6-150. dani=hya=naga=napo-ma-afu?here=ABL=TOP where=ALL go:FUT-NEG:IR-2SG

canbe.together-NEG:IR-1SG‘Can I be together (with you)?’ (mome ‘be together’ class I; -a class IB; 80I)An extension of this interrogative function is that future tentative clauses in
the form of polarity questions also convey indirect commands or exhortations in the
right contexts (mainly when the subject is the addressee). Commands and
exhortations expressed by future tentative verb forms are less direct and more polite
than commands or exhortations expressed by imperative verb forms (§6.3.1).6-155. byama-dom-afu.coconut NEG:IR-drink:FUT-2SG

(numu (num-) ‘sit’ class I; -afu class IB)6.3.4Counterfactual mood
Counterfactual mood conveys that the polarity of the proposition is oppositeto what has actually occurred. Counterfactual verb forms have a non-future finite
verb, a counterfactual suffix -naho at the end of the verb, and cross-reference
suffix(es) in between:
•class IB/ IHB cross-reference suffix(es) for class I and IH verb stems;•class IIB subject plus class IIB object suffixes for class IIB verb stems;•class IIA subject plus class IIB object suffixes for class II verb stems; and•class III subject plus class IIIB object suffixes for class III verb stems.","[402, 403, 404, 405, 406]"

Except for copulas (§6.4), there are no verb forms which indicateinterrogative mood specifically. Polarity questions are only distinguished from their
statement counterparts by intonation: statements usually end in low pitch, whereas
questions end in a high pitch (§2.4.2).","[376, 377]"

Tentative mood conveys that the proposition is considered to be a possibleoutcome or possible conclusion by the speaker, comparable with the use of the
English modal verb may when it is used in an epistemic sense to convey uncertainty.
386The formation of tentative mood verb forms differ between non-future tenses
(§6.3.3.1) and future tense (§6.3.3.2). In future tense, tentative mood verb forms
also function as questions or indirect requests.","[400, 401]"

case clitic =mbo (§4.5.1); cross-linguistically it is common for case clitics to be
grammaticalised as markers of dependent clauses (see discussions in §6.1). As for
the dependency suffix -mbona, this is likely to be bimorphemic: -mbo and -na.
There are two nominal clitics in the shape of na: the topic clitic =na (§4.5.7) and
the allative case clitic =na ~ =nambo (§4.5.3). Another word with the shape na is
the conjunction na ‘and’ (§3.2.6). (However, this conjunction na may not be a
native word; it is likely to be a loanword from Tok Pisin.) Currently, it is
inconclusive as to which may be the origin of na in -mbona. Careful study of the
corresponding dependency suffixes in Dla proper may shed light to this problem.
Unfortunately, at the moment it is not clear to me what exactly the forms of the
dependency suffixes are in Dla proper (but at least it is known that the topic clitic
and allative case clitic in Dla proper are not homophonous: =nya and =na(mbo)
respectively). Another question about the dependency suffixes in Menggwa Dla is
hy na itself is not used as a dependency suffix, and why na must follow rather than507precede mbo to function as a dependency suffixes. Before these questions are
answered, I leave -mbona as not further analysable morphologically.","[520, 521, 522]"

can also be followed by gwa ‘but’ (§3.2.6), the exclamatory particle ke or the

agreement or existence (ini ‘yes’ is used in agreement with a negatively-polarised
question), whereas awe ‘no’ is used to indicate non-agreement or non-existence (in

1=TOP 2SG:OBJwant.favour.from-1SG-2SG:O-PRES‘I want you to do (me) a favour.’ (60I)When a (pro)nominal cooccurs with a corresponding cross-reference suffix,
there is the question of whether the cross-reference suffix or the (pro)nominal
occupies the argument position (see footnote 16), i.e. whether the cross-reference
suffixes are ‘pronominal agreement’ (occupying argument positions) or
‘grammatical agreement’ (not occupying argument positions) in the sense of Bresnan
and Mchombo (1987). I leave this question unanswered; I adopt a theoryindependent view that a core grammatical relation can be expressed by both a crossreference suffix and an agreeing (pro)nominal.18 After all, the full interpretation of a
semantic argument may sometimes need to be established by both a (pro)nominal
and an agreeing person marker, even in a language like English which is said to only
have ‘grammatical agreement’ only, e.g. in a sentence like the fish eat-Ø everythingI drop into the tank. In Menggwa Dla, there are also cases where the full
interpretation of a semantic argument can only be established by both a (pro)nominal
and a cross-reference suffixes. In the following example, the citation pronoun si
(§4.6.1) has a more specific person feature than the cross-reference suffix -efi (class
IB; §5.2.1), but the cross-reference suffix -efi carries number and gender features
which the pronoun si lacks. Together the pronoun and the cross-reference suffix18Nonetheless, this ‘theory-independent’ view is in a lot of ways akin to the position taken by Barlow
(1992) and Pollard & Sag (1988). For Barlow, agreement is not a morphosyntactic notion where
morphosyntactic features have to be matched between two linguistic expressions, nor a semantic
notion where certain semantic properties of one or a group of referents are expressed; agreement is
a discourse notion where both the agreement expression and the agreed reference contribute to the
identification and characterisation of the discourse referents.","[316, 317]"

Verbs in semi-realis status are statements which convey the speaker’sabsolute certainty that a proposition will hold in the future, and that the speaker is
committed to the truth value of of the proposition. Semi-realis sentences cannot be
used as questions; future tense questions are in irrealis mood (§6.3). The following
are a few examples of clauses with verbs in semi-realis status.","[386, 387, 388, 389, 390]"

The topic clitic =na marks a (pro)nominal as a topic expression. Topicexpressions are placed at the beginning of a clause, except when they are preceded
by a locative word (§3.2.7), temporal word (§3.2.8; example 4-136 below), or
conjunction (§3.2.6; example 4-145 below), in which case the topic expression
would follow these constituents immediately (also see below for clauses with two
topic expressions). Alternatively, a topic phrase may be not clause-initial because it
is preceded by another topic phrase (see towards the end of this §4.5.6). Topic
expressions are most usually also the grammatical subject of the clause; subjects are
zero case-marked in Menggwa Dla (§4.5.1; 5.3.1), and the topic clitic =na is
attached directly at the end of the topic expressions. The following are examples of
topic expressions are also the subject of the clause.4-133. wali=na gake-o?pig=TOP where COP:where-3FSG

‘Yesterday I collected eggs, and…’Nevertheless, the topic clitic is not obligatorily used; the topic clitics in the
examples above can be omitted freely. The clause-initial position is also not
‘reserved’ for topic expressions. For instance, a topic phrase can be preceded by a
locative/ temporal word as in example 4-136 above. Focused expressions, e.g.
interrogative words (§3.2.3), can also be in clause-initial position, as shown in the
example below. As expected, the topic clitic =na cannot be attached to question
words, as question words are always focused and cannot be topicalised. In the
example below, =na is an allative case clitic (§4.5.3) and not a topic clitic. This
can be established by the fact that allative case clitic can freely alternate between=na and =nambo, whereas the topic clitic has only one form: =na.1717The topic clitic is not homophonous with the allative case clitic in Dla proper and Anggor. In Dla
proper the topic clitic is =nya and the allative clitic is =na(mbo). In Anggor, the topic clitic is =ana and
the allative clitic is =na(mbo) (Litteral 1980: 79-80).","[250, 251, 252]"

"6.2SemiSemi-realis status
Semi-realis status encompasses only one tense-mood category — futuredeclarative (other future categories are irrealis; §6.3). Future declarative verbs of
positive and negative polarities have markedly different morphological forms:
positive semi-realis verbs are characterised by a serialised ‘positive semi-realis verb’
366samby (class I) (§6.2.1), whereas negative semi-realis verbs have a negative semirealis particle ga (§6.2.2). Finite verb stems are used for semi-realis verb forms
(§5.1.1), and if the lexical verb lexeme makes a distinction between future versus
non-future finite verb stems (§5.1.2), the future form must be used. The form of the
positive semi-realis verb varies greatly depending on the person-number-gender
features of the subject, and it is difficult to give a general morphological template of
positive semi-realis verbs. In some cases the positive semi-realis verb forms a
separate phonological word from the lexical verb, and in other cases the positive
semi-realis verb forms a phonological word together with the lexical verb (see
§6.2.1). On the other hand, negative semi-realis verbs are morphologically simple in
comparison. Negative semi-realis verb forms begin with a negative semi-realis
particle ga and then followed by a (future) finite verb stem (§5.1.1-2) together with
its cross-reference suffix(es). The cross-reference suffixes used in negative semirealis verb forms are always class A suffixes (§5.2). The negative semi-relias
particle ga is a separate phonological word.ga(FUTURE) FINITE VERB STEM — CLASS A CROSS-REF SUFFIX(ES)The following verbs exemplify realis versus semi-realis, and positive versus

immediate past time and immediate future time, whereas future tense conveys nonimmediate future time (§6). Present imperative-jussive conveys that the speaker
wishes that the content of the command/ exhortation/ invitation/ permission be
fulfilled immediately after the time of utterance, whereas future imperative-jussive
conveys that the speaker wishes that the content of the command/ exhortation/

"THE MENGGWA DLA LANGUAGE
OF NEW GUINEAHILÁRIO DE SOUSAA thesis submitted in fulfilment of
the requirements for the degree of
Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Linguistics
University of SydneyNovember 2006Abstract
Menggwa Dla is a Papuan language spoken in Sandaun Province of Papua
New Guinea and Kabupaten Jayapura of Papua Province, Indonesia. Menggwa Dla is a
dialect of the Dla language; together with its sister language Anggor (e.g. Litteral
1980), the two languages form the Senagi language family, one of the small Papuan
language families found in North-Central New Guinea.
The main text of this thesis is divided into seven chapters. Chapter 1
introduces the linguistic, cultural and political landscapes of the Indonesia-Papua
New Guinea border area where the Dla territory is located. Chapter 2 introduces the
phonology of Menggwa Dla; described in this chapter are the phonemes, allophonic
variations, phonotactics, morpho-phonological processes, stress assignment and
intonation of the language. The inventory of phonemes in Menggwa is average for a
Papuan language (15 consonants and 5 vowels). The vast majority of syllables come
in the shape of V, CV or C1C2V where C2 can be /n/ /r/ /l/ /j/ or /w/. In C1C2V
syllables, the sonority rises from C1 to V (§2.2.2). Nevertheless, there are a few
words with word-medial consonant sequences like ft /ɸt/, lk /lk/, lf /lɸ/ or lk /lk/
where the sonority drops from the first to the second consonant; the first consonant
in these sequences is analysed as the coda of the previous syllable (§2.2.3).
Chapter 3 is an overview of the word classes in Menggwa Dla; the
morphological, syntactic and semantic properties of the three major word classes
(nouns, adjectives and verbs) and the minor word classes are compared in this
chapter. Chapter 4 describes the properties of nouns and noun phrases; the personnumber-gender categories, noun-phrasal syntax, nominal clitics and personal
pronouns are outlined in this chapter. Menggwa Dla has a rich array of case, topic
and focus markers which comes in the form of clitics (§4.5). Subject pronouns
(‘citation pronouns’) only mark person (i.e. one for each of the three persons),
whereas object and genitive pronouns mark person (including inclusive/exclusive
first person), number, and sometimes also gender features (§4.6).
Chapter 5 introduces various morphological and syntactic issues which are
common to both independent and dependent clauses: verb stems, verb classes,iicross-referencing, intraclausal syntax, syntactic transitivity and semantic valence.
Cross-referencing in Menggwa Dla is complex: there are seven paradigms of subject
cross-reference suffixes and four paradigms of object cross-references. Based on
their cross-referencing patterns, verbs are classified into one of five verb classes
(§5.2). There is often a mismatch between the number of cross-reference suffixes,
the semantic valence, and the syntactic transitivity within a clause. There are verbs
where the subject cross-reference suffix, or the object suffix, or both the subject and
object suffixes are semantically empty (‘dummy cross-reference suffixes’; §5.3.2).
Chapter 6 outlines the morphology of independent verbs and copulas.
Verbal morphology differs greatly between the three statuses of realis, semi-realis
and irrealis; a section is devoted to the morphology for each of the three statuses.
Chapter 7 introduces the dependent clauses and verbal noun phrases. Different
types of dependent verbs are deverbalised to various degrees: subordinate verbs are
the least deverbalised, chain verbs are more deverbalised (but they mark switchreference (SR), and sometimes also interclausal temporal relations), and non-finite
chain verbs even more deverbalised. Further deverbalised than the non-finite chain
verbs are the verbal nouns; verbal noun phrases in Menggwa Dla functions
somewhat like complement clauses in English.
In younger speakers speech, the function of the chain clause SR system has
diverted from the canonical SR system used by older speakers (§7.2.2). For younger
speakers, coreferential chain verb forms and disjoint-reference chain verb forms
only have their coreferential and disjoint-referential meaning — respectively —
when the person-number-gender features of the two subject cross-reference
suffixes cannot resolve the referentiality of the two subjects. Otherwise, the
coreferential chain verb forms have become the unmarked SR-neutral chain verb
forms.
At the end of this thesis are appendix 1, which contains four Menggwa Dla
example texts, and appendix 2, which contains tables of cross-reference suffixes,
pronouns, copulas and irregular verbs.iiiTable of contents

During these few years I have been so focused in my research that I have
unknowingly neglected a lot of people who have gone out of their way to help me
achieve my goals. I feel ashamed at not always able to reciprocate the assistance
given to me. I thank you all for helping me, and I sincerely apologise for not being
able to list the names of everyone whom I would like to thank here.
First of all, this thesis would not have existed without the help of the Dla
people. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all Dla people for their
generosity in sharing with me their beautiful language and culture. In particular, I
would like to thank my main language teachers: Donald Yawa, David Yawa, †Simon
Kore and Stanis Kore.
I would like to thank the Department of Education of Sandaun Province, the
Indonesian consulate in Vanimo and the Papua New Guinean consulate in Jayapura
(especially Sephy Rollo) for their assistance. I have been looked after by the
Catholic hierarchy everywhere in New Guinea. I would like to thank Bishop Cesare
Bonivento PIME of Vanimo, Fr. မာေတးအုိ Matteo Joi and Fr. Pepito Estaniel MSP who
were the parish priests at Kamberatoro, the Passionists in Vanimo and Port Moresby
(in particular, Br. Jerome Dunn CP and Br. James Coucher CP who spent most of
their lives in New Guinea helping people of the border region), Kevin and Gail and
others at Dovair in Vanimo, and Jaap van der Werf in Jayapura. I would also like to
thank BJ Kim, Danny Lim, Kirsten Bishop and Peter Lockey etc. for looking after me
in Port Moresby.
I would like to show my deepest appreciation to my supervisors William
Foley and Jane Simpson at University of Sydney. I am very fortunate to have them
as my supervisors. Their strengths complemented each other, and I have learnt
from them valuable academic skills. (Any shortcomings in this thesis are of cause
my own fault.) Their encouragements led me in constantly trying to improve the
quality of my research. Other than academic support, Bill also funded most of my
fieldtrips to New Guinea. ཐགས་ེ་ཆེ་གནང།xI would like to thank Toni Borowsky at University of Sydney and Elaine
Ballard at University of Auckland for going through several incarnations of the
phonology chapter with me. Talking with Doug Marmion at Australian National
University about his fieldwork experiences in Sandaun Province was most helpful. I
would like to thank Robert and Shirley Litteral for their amazing insights of the
Anggor language (not a lot of people get to work on a language with just one sister
language).
I also owe gratitude to Alexandra Aikhenvald at La Trobe University,
Frantisek Lichtenberk at University of Auckland, Mark Donohue at Monash
University, Michael Walsh at University of Sydney, George van Driem at Universiteit
Leiden, Matthew Dryer at State University of New York, Lesley Stirling at University
of Melbourne and Mark Harvey at University of Newcastle and for many stimulating
discussions in linguistics and life in general. In addition, Lesley has — on many
occasions — directly or indirectly introduced me to some of the most interesting
pieces of research by various top-quality linguists (including herself), often on
linguistic issues which I knew very little about.
It has been inspiring talking to — and in some cases reading the thesis of —
the following linguistic people currently or previously at University of Sydney: Ilana
Mushin, Ikuko Nakane, Linda Barwick, Debra Aarons, John Gibbons, Ahmar
Mahboob, James Martin, Aet Lees, I Wayan Arka, Bill Palmer, Brett Baker, Andrew
Ingram, Johnson Welem Haan, Lea Brown, Barbara Jones, Zeid Al-Dakkan, Nicoletta
Romeo, Carmel O’Shannessy, JoAnne Page, Kamaludin Yusra, St.John Skilton, Adam
Blaxter-Paliwala, Jackie Chang, Miriam Corris, Melissa Crowther, Lila San Roque,
Myfany Turpin, Louise de Beuzeville, Talia Gill, Claire Hill, Matthew & Donna
Toulmin, Joseph Blythe, Amanda Oppliger, Chong Han, Winnie Chor, Marie Fellbaum
Korpi, Bronwyn Dyson, Derek Herforth, Nerida Jarkey, Ian Smith, Tom Honeyman,
Fiona Blake, Aiden Wilson, James McElvenny, Rebecca Defina and Anthony Phillips.
(Sorry if I have missed anyone.)
Other academics I would like to thank include Mike Moxness at SIL Sentani,
Eileen Gasaway at SIL Ukarumpa, Wiem Burung at SIL Kangaroo Ground; HelenxiCharters, Fay Wouk, Ross Clark, Donna Starks, †Scott Allan, Andreea Calude, Andy
Gibson, Edward McDonald (谢谢), Harumi Minagawa (有難う御座います) and
Wayne Lawrence (一杯御拝でーびるさい) at University of Auckland; Nick Evans,
Nick Thieberger, Sebastian Fedden and Robyn Loughnane at University of
Melbourne; Tonya Stebbins at La Trobe University, Andrew Pawley, Malcolm Ross,
John Bowden, Carol Priestley, Jason Lee, Pascale Jacq and Antoinette Schapper at
Australian National University; and Ritsuko Kikusawa & Lawrence Reid who
constantly float between various institutions in the world.
I would also like to thank Virginia Mayger, Eugene Chan, Mary Yew, Maria
Cortes, Brett Millar, Daniel Haggard and other administrative staff at the University
of Sydney for their continuous help with all the things that I do not want to deal
with on my own.
I owe my life to Alfredo F.X. de Souza, Chi-Peng Ieong, Antónia de Sousa and
Joana de Sousa. Without their continuous support I would not have reached this far.
Obrigado and 多謝 from the bottom of my heart. Amongst all my relatives whom I
would to thank (sorry, I am not able to name them all; I have too many relatives), I
would like to say 多謝 to my cousin Winnie Lok-Yin Yeung for putting me up and
letting me bother her in Brisbane many times on my way to and from New Guinea.
(I hope you like the presents I bought you in Jayapura or Port Moresby.)
Peter Withers sacrificed a lot in order to help me. Amongst the endless list
of things I want to thank him for are: a) creating a solar-panel-charging-device to
power my computer in New Guinea; b) guiding me in computer graphics; and c)
making me laugh. Also having my love are Barbara Machin, Rev. David Withers,
Catherine Withers, Tim Wright, Stellar Wright and Chester Wright in South
Australia who support me unconditionally.
Finally, I may not be very religious, but I am deeply theistic. I thank Tuhan
Allah for everything.xiiAbbreviations and conventions

Menggwa Dla.xivChapter 1IntroductionThis thesis is primarily a description of the phonology, morphology and
syntax of the Menggwa dialect of the Dla language, a Papuan language spoken on
both sides of the vertical 141°E borderline between Papua New Guinea and Papua
Province of Indonesia (also known as Papua Barat West Papua)1 at around 3°40′S,
about a hundred kilometres inland from the northern coast. There are two dialects of
Dla: Menggwa Dla is the minority dialect, and it is spoken by around 200 people;
the majority dialect, which I call Dla proper, has around 1000 speakers. The ‘×’ in
map 1.1 below shows the approximate centre point of Dla territory in New Guinea.
(see also map 1.2 in §1.2.1 and map 1.14 in §1.4.4).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"

A negative realis independent clause is formed by the lexical verb in its non-finite form (§5.1.1) followed by a negative realis verb boke (class I) or boka (class
II). Whether boke or boka is used depends on the verb class membership (§5.2) of
the lexical verb: for class I, IH and IIB lexical verbs, boke (class I) is used; for class
II and III lexical verbs, boka (class II) is used. Class IH, IIB and III lexical verbs
have mismatching classes of cross-reference suffixes between positive and negative
realis verb forms: in positive realis, the finite lexical verb stem itself controls the
class membership of the cross-reference suffixes; in negative realis, it is the negative
realis verb boke (class I) or boka (class II) which controls the membership of the
cross-reference suffixes. The following table summarises the class of crossreference suffix used in positive realis verb form versus negative realis verb form.","[370, 371]"
"There is no affix marking positive irrealis specifically. The positive irrealis
verb forms have the following morphological structure (the prohibitive mood verbs
are never in positive polarity):FINITE VERB STEM — CROSS REF SUFFIX(ES) — TM SUFFIXFormally, the negative irrealis verbs differ from the positive irrealis verbs by
having an extra negative irrealis affix which is affixed to the verb stem. The
negative realis affix has the form of ma-, -ma, -me or -m. The negative realis affix
is always ma- when affixed to non-finite verb stems (§5.1.1). For finite verb stems,
the regular allomorphy of the negative irrealis affix is as follows:•-ma is suffixed to class IIB, class II or class III verb stems.",[393]
"6.3.3.1Non-future tentative mood
Positive non-future tentative mood verb forms consist of a non-future finiteverb stem (§5.1.2), followed by subset A cross-reference suffix(es) (except for class
IIB verbs which must always take class IIB cross-reference suffixes; §5.2.2), and
finally by a tentative -ni. Negative forms have a negative irrealis affix ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m/ (§6.3) affixed to the non-future finite verb stem (§5.1.2).6-141. yafli sihafaiplwa ser-yefye-ni.dog 2SG:GEN fisheat-N1FDU-TENT‘Maybe the dogs ate/ is eating your fish.’

Future tentative mood verbs always carry a negative irrealis affix; there is nopositive formal counterpart. Even though all future tentative mood verbs have a
negative irrealis affix, the speaker is not biased towards the positive or negative
outcome by using a future tentative verb. Future tentative verb forms are formed by
a future finite verb stem, a negative irrealis affix (§6), a set of cross-reference
suffixes, and optionally a tentative suffix -ni. The sets of cross-referencing used are

sentence remains ambiguous. Also see the paradigm of class IIA cross-reference suffixes in §5.2.2.","[401, 402]"
"The negative form of a DR chain verb is formed by serialising a negative verbboke (class I) or boka (class II) in DR chain verb form to a non-finite form of the
lexical verb; class I, IH and IIB lexical verbs take boke (which takes class I crossreference suffixes), whereas class II and III lexical verbs take boka (which takes
class II cross-reference suffixes). This is formally the same as the negative realis
verb boke/ boka used in independent clauses (§5.1.3). Nevertheless, the chain clause
negative verb boke/ boka does not indicate status, unlike the independent clause
negative realis verb boke/ boka which indicates realis status. The following are
examples of positive CR chain verbs, positive DR chain verbs and negative DR chain
verbs in different verb classes. Notice the changes in the cross-reference suffixes,
especially when the negative verb boke (class I)/ boka (class II) is used. The class
III verb lexeme sefi (sa-/ da-) ‘give’ has a special negative non-finite form sekoni
(§5.2.3).",[466]
"4347.1.2.1Realis -hwani ‘when’ clauses
A realis -hwani verb has a (non-future) finite verb stem (§5.1.1-2), subset Across-reference suffix(es) (§5.2), and a -hwani ‘when’ suffix at the end. With realis-hwani clauses, the situation is known by the speaker as having occurred (positive
polarity) or not occurred (negative polarity), or habitually occurring (positive) or
habitually not occurring (negative), and the situation of the matrix clause begins
after the inchoation point of the situation of the -hwani clause. The use of
subordinate realis -hwani clauses is rather rare, for that sequential meaning is mostly
conveyed by chain clauses (§7.2). A realis -hwani clause is used as the final clause
of a non-finite clause chain or when it is followed by non-finite chain clauses (and
non-finite chain clauses themselves are rather rare; §7.3.1). In a non-finite chain
clause, the subject must be coreferential with the subject of the following clause in
the clause chain. On the other hand, the subject of a -hwani clause must be disjointreferential with the subject of its matrix clause. In effect, a non-finite chain verb
and a realis -hwani verb is the coreferential (CR) and disjoint-referential (DR) verb
forms — respectively — of a switch-reference (SR) system. Nevertheless, this nonfinite/ -hwani SR system is used much less often than the chain clause SR system.
(See §7.2 on chain clauses and §7.3.1 on non-finite chain clauses.)In the following examples, the clauses preceding the -hwani clauses are nonfinite chain clauses; in example 7-48 the -hwani clause is followed by another nonfinite chain clause, and in example 7-49 the -hwani clause is followed by an
independent clause. Notice the change in subject between the realis -hwani clause
and the following matrix clause in both examples.","[448, 449]"

Positive irrealis -hwani verbs have the same form as realis -hwani verbs(§7.1.2.1), except that sometimes a future finite verb stem is used instead of a nonfuture finite verb stem (see below). Negative irrealis -hwani verbs are formed by
affixing the negative irrealis affix ma-/ -m/ -ma/ -me (§6.3) to the verb stem of a
positive irrealis -hwani verb.","[449, 450, 451]"

be the time of utterance (absolute tense) or the time of some other clause (relative
tense). Three tenses are distinguished: past, present and future tense. Present tense
in Menggwa Dla conveys present time or near present time. Near present time
refers to immediate past time or immediate future time, in other words time which is
considered by the speaker to be near the present time, typically no more than a few
minutes away from the present time. Correspondingly, past tense and future tense
convey non-immediate past time and non-immediate future time respectively. If the
progression of time is represented by a horizontal line running from left to right, and
the time of utterance by an × on the horizontal time line, this is how the tenses in
Menggwa Dla dissect the time line:2‘Time of utterance’ and ‘present time’ here refer to the time of utterance in real time or the time of

the eastern villages of Menggau and Wahai, but not in western villages of
Wanggurinda and Menggwal, there is a trend of the negative irrealis suffix (ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m; §6.3) being used to indicate negative realis.8 These innovative
negative realis verb forms are formed by the positive realis verb form (e.g. example
6-70) affixed by a negative irrealis affix, which now also indicates negative realis
(e.g. example 6-69b, compare this with the conservative negative realis form 6-69a).
Example 6-71 demonstrates a negative irrealis verb form.","[375, 376]"
"Negative non-future copulas and the future interrogative copulas have the
same forms (e.g. both have the non-finite form me). This unification suggest that
with copulas, negativity is semantically subordinate to the status of irrealis, unlike
other verbs where negativity is independent from status (§6.1; §6.2; §6.3). Negative
non-future/ future interrogative copulas have a class IB cross-reference suffix, except399that when the subject is first person singular (1SG), the class IA suffix of -aha is used
instead (some younger speakers pronounce this suffix as -aya). The negative nonfuture/ future interrogative copula stem is me, except when the following crossreference suffix begins with a, then the copula stem is m. This allomorphy is
identical with that of the negative irrealis affix (§6.3).","[413, 414]"
"FINITE VERB STEM — CROSS-REF SUFFIX(ES) — TA SUFFIXNegative realis verbs are formed with the lexical verb in its non-finite form plus a
following negative realis verb boke (class I) or boka (class II). The non-finite verb
stem (§5.1.1) of the lexical verb and the negative realis verb boke/ boka are separate
phonological words. Class I, IH and IIB lexical verbs take boke, while class II and
III lexical verbs take boka. The class of cross-reference suffixes used, however, are
338determined by the verb class of the negative realise verb boke and boka: boke is a
class I verb, and boka is a class II verb. See §6.1.3 for more discussions on negative
realis verb forms.","[352, 353]"

76The following are some examples containing the alveolar trill /r/ <r> [r].
The phoneme /r/ can be the second phoneme of a consonant cluster (i.e. CrV; see
§2.2.2). Like /l/, word initial /r/’s are very rare. The following are examples of
word medial /r/.2-96. barala /barala/ [barala] ‘index finger’

‘inside’Glides
There are two glide phonemes: palatal approximant /j/ <y> and labiovelarapproximant /w/ <w>. The phoneme /j/ is always realised as the palatal
approximant [j]. When preceding non-low vowels (/i e ʊ u/), /w/ is realised as [w].
77When preceding low vowels (i.e. /a/), /w/ is lowered to [o̯]. Native speakers’
spelling of word-medial /wa/ alternates between <wa> and <oa>. For instance,
the past tense suffix -hwa /-xwa/ [-xo̯a] (§6.1.1) is often spelt as <hoa> by native
speakers. In this thesis, instances of /wa/ are consistently spelt as <wa>./w/  [o̯] / __aBoth /j/ and /w/ can be the second consonant of a consonant cluster (i.e. CjV,
CwV; see §2.2.2). The following are a few examples of /j/ and /w/ in various
positions.2-107. wanu/wanu/[o̯anu]‘money’2-108. wi/wi/[wi]‘child’2-109. wuli/wuli/[wuli]‘house’2-110. yama/jama/[jama]‘shell’2-111. aya/aja/[ʔaja]‘father’2-112. yowala /jʊwala/ [jʊo̯ala]‘my’ (1SG:GEN)2-113. yu/ju/[ju]‘cuscus’2-114. gwi/ɡwi/[ɡwi]‘another’2-115. ambya/abja/[ʔambja]‘hole’2-116. kyahwa /kjaxwa/ [kjaɣo̯a]

‘white people’ (< Malay: tuan ‘mister’)The glides /j/ and /w/ are not vowels underlyingly; there are minimal pairs
between /j/ and /i/ and between /w/ and /u/ on the other hand, albeit all the known78minimal pairs between the glides and high vowels are not monomorphemic. The
following are some sets of class IIB cross-reference suffixes (§5.2.2); all of them
have a third person feminine singular object (3FSG:O) cross-reference suffix -a, but
their subject cross-reference suffix varies. Examples 2-118 and 2-119 are a minimal
pair between /j/ and /i/, examples 2-120 and 2-121 are a minimal pair between /w/
and /u/, and examples 2-122 and 2-123 are a near minimal pair between /w/ and /u/.2-118. hya /xja/(< -hya-a /-xja-a/ (-1SG-3FSG:O)); vs.2-119. hia /xia/(< -hi-a/-xi-a/(-N1FPL-3FSG:O))2-120. hwa /xwa/ (< -hwa-a /-xwa-a/ (-1DU-3FSG:O)); vs.

the corresponding high vowels /i/ and /u/ in a number of ways:
•Firstly, the duration of the glides is shorter than the duration of the high
vowels. In a glide-plus-vowel sequence like /ja/ or /wa/, the two segments
belong to the same syllable, and the duration of the glide is shorter than
the following vowel. In a sequence of vowels like /ia/ or /ua/, the two
vowels belong to separate syllables, and the duration of the first vowel is
similar to the duration of the second vowel;•Secondly, in a glide-plus-vowel sequence like /ja/ or /wa/, the glide and
vowel belong to the same syllable, and the whole syllable is either
stressed or not stressed. In contrast, in a vowel sequence like /i.a/ or /u.a/,79the two vowels is syllabified as two separate syllables, and only one of the
syllables would be stressed (see §2.4.1 on stress assignment);
•Thirdly, in a sequence of glide and vowel, it is often the case that the
quality of the vowel is assimilated by the glide, or the quality of the glide
is assimilated by the vowel. As seen above, /wa/ is pronounced as [o̯a],
with the [w] lowered due to the influence of the following [a]. The
reverse scenario, i.e. progressive assimilation, is true for the sequence /ja/:
the [a] is often raised to [ɛ] due to the high tongue position of [j]. In a
vowel sequence like /ia/ or /ua/, the quality of the two vowels is kept as
distinct as possible from each other. In addition, when /u/ is followed by
a vowel, /u/ is usually a little bit centralised: [u̟] (§2.1.3.7).","[89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"

mood (§6.3.1). Prohibitive verb forms are non-finite as well; they do not carry any

"Independent verbs are grammatically marked for status1, tense, aspect, mood
and/or polarity. In terms of verbal morphology, the most important categories are
status and polarity (polarity is independent of status in Menggwa Dla), as the overall
morphological structure of a verb is determined first by its status and polarity. A lot
of languages have a binary realis-irrealis status distinction; Mithun (1999:173)
generalises the binary status distinction as follows: ‘The realis portrays situations as
actualized, as having occurred or actually occurring, knowable through direct
perception. The irrealis portrays situations as purely within the realm of thought,
knowable only through imagination’. In addition to realis status and irrealis status,
there is also an in-between status category called ‘semi-realis’ in Menggwa Dla,
which signifies that on one hand it is like irrealis in that the situation is imagined,
but on the other hand it is like realis in that the speaker is conveying his/ her
certainty over the realisation (positive future declarative) or non-realisation (negative
future declarative) of the situation.",[349]

Predicates are not always verbal; nominals and pronominals can also formpredicates. Copulas are placed after predicate nominals and predicate pronominals
to provide subject cross-referencing, tense, aspect, mood and/or polarity information,
as nominals do not provide this grammatical information and pronominals provide
cross-referencing information at most. The main usages of copulas are: a) to equate
the predicate (pro)nominal with the subject (pro)nominal (equative usage); and b) to
403indicate that the referent(s) of the subject (pro)nominal is/ are properly included in
the set of referents of the predicate (pro)nominal (proper-inclusion usage). In
equative and proper-inclusion copular clauses, predicate nominals are not casemarked, and predicate pronouns are in their citation forms. Equative and properinclusion copular clauses are introduced in §6.4.2.1. There are also other copula
clauses where the predicate (pro)nominal is case marked; they are introduced in
§6.4.2.2-5.","[415, 416, 417, 418]"
"Another noteworthy point is that this ‘light’ versus ‘heavy’ distinction also
extends to folk phonology. Speakers of Menggwa Dla often comment that the high
vowels of i /i/ and u /u/ ‘sound light’, whereas the mid vowels of e /e/ and o /ʊ/
‘sound heavy’. One pair of examples demonstrating this ‘sound-weight-gender’
correspondence is the words hufu ‘sun’ (masculine) and hofo ‘ground’ (feminine).
Another pair of examples is the class IB and class IHB cross-reference suffixes for
third person singular: -u for masculine and -o for feminine (§5.2.1). Some semirealis positive verb forms (§6.2.1) take a masculine suffix -i or a feminine suffix -e,
e.g. lahumbi ‘he will be’ versus lahombe ‘she will be’. The masculine suffix -i and
the feminine suffix -e are used more frequently in Anggor (Litteral 1990:53-54), e.g.an-i ‘he is’ versus an-e ‘she is’.",[208]

like the realis negative verb boke (class I)/ boka (class II) (§§6.1.3) or the
completive verb fefi (fa-) (class IIB) (§7.4), the lexical verb must be (for realis

examples of the verb apu (ap-) ‘sleep’ (class I) in past tense (§6.1.2), present tense
continuous aspect (§6.1.1) and future tense (§6.2). The finite verb stem remains
invariant for apu (ap-) ‘sleep’ (class I) and most other verb lexemes.","[275, 276]"

formally a citation pronoun, but the person category they mark is slightly different:yo for first person exclusive, si for first person inclusive and second person, and ai

inclusive distinction; §4.6.1). The citation pronouns are then followed by another
person marking morpheme: yo is followed by -hw, si is followed by -h, and ai is
followed by -ah. After the two person morphs, genitive pronouns take a class IA247cross-reference suffix, whereas object pronouns carry a class IB cross-reference
suffix (§5.2.1), with the exception that a) any e at the end of the class IB suffix is
changed to a, e.g. the N1FDU suffix -efye becomes -efya when used in a genitive
pronoun, e.g. ai-ah-efya (3-3-N1FDU); and b) the N1MPL suffix used in genitive

pronouns cannot be omitted, in contrast with the nominal object case clitic =mbo
which is optional in most circumstances (see §4.5.1). The pronouns for first person
singular and third person singular are irregular in both paradigms:

"17In Dutch documents the Dla tribe was referred as Dĕra. In Dla proper, dla [d(ɨ)ɺa] means ‘name’. In
Dutch-Malay orthography, ĕ represents a schwa [ə]; the ĕ in Dĕra is a rendition of the epenthetic
vowel in Dla proper, which ranges from [ɨ] to [ə] (§1.4.2). The r in Dera is a rendition of the liquid
phoneme in Dla proper, which is usually realised as an alveolar lateral flap [ɺ].

It is not the case that the Dutch authority did not know the location of the borderline. For instance,
the hand-drawn map in Galis (1956) shows correctly which villages fall on which side of the border.

"5.1Verb stems
Every verb and verbal noun has a verb stem which provides the basic lexicalmeaning. There are verb lexemes of which the verb stem remains constant in all
environments, e.g. the verb stem of the verb lexeme bara ‘run’ (class I) is alwaysbara-. Other verb lexemes have two or more allomorphic verb stems: some verb
lexemes have a ‘non-finite verb stem’ and one or more ‘finite verb stem(s)’ (§5.1.1),
e.g. the verb lexeme pefi ‘close’ (class IIB) has the non-finite verb stem pefi- and the
finite verb stem pa-. A small number of frequently used verb lexemes make a
further distinction of ‘non-future finite verb stem’ and ‘future finite verb stem’
(§5.1.2), e.g. the verb lexeme hanu ‘go down’ (class IH) has the non-finite verb stemhanu-, non-future finite verb stem form han-, and future finite verb stem gan-. Some
verb stems may exhibit other irregularities (§5.1.3).",[273]

Protases, in other words the ‘if’ clauses of conditional sentences, can bemarked in two different ways. Simple indicative protases, of which the truth value
can be true or false, are expressed as irrealis -hwani clauses (§7.1.2). On the other
hand, hypothetical protases, in other words protases of which the polarity must be
false based on real word knowledge, are indicated by chain clauses. The
dependency suffix (§7.5) of a hypothetical protasis chain verb is usually -mbona, but-mbo can be used as well. Hypothetical protasis often have counterfactual apodoses

Non-finite chain clauses and verbal nouns are rare in natural discourse. Non-finite chain verbs and verbal nouns are formally nearly identical; non-finite chain
verbs are formed with a non-finite verb stem (§5.1.1), an optional ‘posterior’ suffix -mba, and a dependency suffix -Ø ~ -mbo ~ -mbona; verbal nouns are formed with a
non-finite verb stem, an optional posterior suffix -mba, and a nominalising suffix -Ø
~ -mbo. In addition, verbal noun phrases can also take certain case clitics (§4.5).
Neither non-finite chain verbs nor verbal carry cross-reference suffixes (§5.2). The
meaning of the ‘posterior’ suffix -mba is different depending on whether it is used
on non-finite chain verbs or verbal nouns, see §7.3.1 and §7.3.2 respectively.","[492, 493, 494]"

a list of verbs in Anggor which demonstrate non-future versus future alterations). Unfortunately,
there are no linguistic clues so far which point towards the possible origin of this morphophonemic
