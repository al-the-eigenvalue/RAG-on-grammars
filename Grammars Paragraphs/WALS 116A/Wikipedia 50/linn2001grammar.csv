"3.1 Y ES/NOQUESTIONS: t E AND 'YA
Yes/No questions are a type of question where the expected answer is
'yes' or 'no.' Yes/No questions are fonned with the irrealis mode particle ye,?although )a can be used in the conditions described below. In addition to a
mode particle, Yes/No questions are signaled by rising intonation.
Wagner (1934: 357) called the particle 'Ie a suffix and described the
placement as verb final, except for the attachment to the negative pre-clitic n2-.
This overlooks two importatn facts about Ye. First, it can be found at the end of
most complete phrases (noun phrase, postposition phrase, verb phrase). Second,
it has a propensity to be found in the second position (in the position after thefirst phrase of a sentence). These facts make it a likely candidate for a clitic (or
bound word). However, there is evidence that the morpheme is an independent
word. First, 'Ze is not reduced phonologically but always bears the most
prominent stress of the utterance and is generally accompanied by high pitch.
Second, like other irrealis particles, 7e can be the verbalizer for verbal nouns.
The Yes/No question marker 'le prefers to be in the second position, that
is, after the end of the first phrase. When there is an independent noun phrase,
the panicle can be in second positon (after the noun phrase) or after the verb
phrase. In these positions, the question marker has scope over the whole
sentence. If the particle comes after any other phrase, it changes the focus to
that phrase.
Because the Yes/No question marker 'le must appear at the end of a
phrase, it can be used as a test to determine the boundaries of phrases
(constituents). The end of phrases often coincides with the end of words, and as
such, it has been helpful in determining suffixes from clitics. Therefore, most of
the patterns are given below to amply illustrate its placement. Although not all
the possible sentence patterns are given in the sections below. the rule that the
Yes/No question particle must be at the end of a complete phrase and its
preference for second position is illustrated in the common sentence patterns
below. These are followed by the exceptions.","[477, 478]"
"*Nek'ala l e h6k'6?
?NEk'ala hGk'6 le?
Although the Yes/No question particle is in second position, its placement with
the negative pre-clitic can also be due to the focus on the negative in negative
questions.",[481]
"(JC:V-1 14)YeslNo Qlresrions with Only Intonation
Yes/No questions can be performed without Ye. In these questions, the
rising intonation of the Yes/No question is exaggerated. In (33). the Yes/No
particle is used, but in (33b), the same question is given w i ~ hjust the rising
intonation. (33c) is another example of rising intonation.

"Information (or content) questions are questions in which the response
contains information beyond 'yes' or 'no.' Information questions contain a
question word (interrogative pronoun). The question words not only signal that
the clause is a question, but they indicate what kind of information is being
asked. With the exception of w i k 'what,'
~
all the question words are formed withthe question stem wa. The question word has rising pitch (indicated with a [;I),but the end of question has falling intonation. With only a few exceptions, the
rising pitch is on the second syllable of the information word. The list of
question words is in (34).

it can also be immediately before the verb phrase (in situ), as in (35b).","[490, 491]"
"Although this is the probable structure, speakers treat the phrase as one word
(indicating that 'le cliticized t~ ke). The question particle with the adverb kide
'now' is treated here as a whole, and is glossed 'n0w.Q' for convenience.
If kide is present, the Yes/No question prefers to attach to this adverb,
with very few exceptions for extreme emphasis elsewhere in the question. The
YYes/No question panicle can be moved after the verb phrase, but speakers rarelydo this outside of elicited forms. The adverb and Yes/No particle keVde is
translated as 'yet' or 'now.' Examples are given in (26).","[485, 486]"

precise nature of the question varies, but all reflect the future and tentative
nature of the copular use of 'ya. Wagner (1934: 357) gave a [-ya] as a suffix forall Yes/No questions concerning the future, but this comprehensive usage does
not exist today. In dl instances, the question is short (noun) and the )a still
functions as the predicate. The position of >a is sentence initial. These Yes/No
questions are transtated as 'how about.'","[488, 489]"
"The question below in (17a) gives a reduplicated location panicle and

"Regitlar Positions o f YeVerb Phrases
The Yes/No question particle is placed at the end of the complete verb
phrase for a sentential reading of the question. The verb phrase is as follows.

second position.",[478]

Negative Phrase
The sentential negative phrase is a pre-clitic on the verb phrase. The
Yes/No question panicle comes after the negative phrase, and so negative

excitement or surprise that they are coming rather than needing information.
The position of the Yes/No question marker between the verb stem and the
auditory -kp shows the evidential is a clitic.",[339]
"5.5 QUESTIONING:
i!.e
The Yes/No question particle is a n irrealis mode particle. Like the other
panicles, it can cause any stem to be read a s a verb. In this case, the truth ofthe situation expressed in the verb is questioned. This function of 'le is clear in
the examples below, where Ye is the only verbalizing particle.
(85)a. Maxine 'le sio'yijthl'i?

Maxine Q 3SG(~~.r).~oss-knife
'Is that Maxine's knife?'
b. Kede chya Ye?

now
hard Q
'Is it hard (fried) yet?'
Unlike the other irrealis panicles, the Yes/ No question particle can beused in all types of verbal constructions in order to ask a question. The
placement is like a clitic in that must come at the end of a complete phrase and
it prefers to be placed after the first full phrase in an utterance (the secondposition). The placement of he Yes/No question particle 'le is detailed in
Chapter 8, Section 3.1.","[336, 337]"

"Exceptional 'le Position: Tense and Mode
The Yes/No question particle can never be placed after the tense or mode
phrase. The questions in (14) are repeated in (28) below, with the addition of
the ungrammatical placement word finally after a tense or mode phrase.

'Can I go with you?'<'le teABLEChanging 'ie Posirion: FocusWhen Ye is not in the 2ndposition, it changes the focus of the question
from the whole sentence to the phrase that it is immediatley following. The
difference can be seen in the meeting questioned in (29) below. Tuesday is the
usual meeting day for this group. In (29a) the question is sentence-level scope.
The question particle comes after the verb phrase and the verb 'see each other' isin question. However, in (29b) the verb is 'meet', but question does not focus on
whether or not they will meet. Rather, the question panicle comes after thenoun phrase 'Monday' because it is different from the usual. So, 'Monday' is the
focus of the question in (29b).",[487]
"The distribution of [ I ] is restricted to one morpheme, the Yes/No Question
particle 'le.
The sound Em] is not a phoneme, but an allophone of In/, and it occurs in
English bomowings. such as Walman' and 'amen' and in English personal names,
such as Martha, Millie, Maggie, Michael, etc.. .","[62, 63]"
"The examples give simple sentences which illustrate the basic use of re
'ability' in relationship to the main verb. In (35a) gives the ability 'can.' In (35b).
the Yes/No question particle comes between the auxiliary re and the verb. In
(35c) the negative ability 'can't' is given: it is predictably formed by the negative
pre-clitic nC- on the beginning of the verb phrase and auxiliary re following the
verb. Throughout. the auxiliary re can be nasalized tP in order to show emphasis
and/or the future.",[314]
"Noun Phrases
When the question contains an independent noun phrase, 'le generally
comes at the end of the complete noun phrase. This is the second position.
However, speakers can (and do) put the Yes/No question marker after the verbphrase when noun phrases are present, apparently without awkwardness and
without a change in focus.
The examples in (19) show 7e after noun phrases which contain only one
noun with no modifiers.

'I used to see them.' (women's speech)Besides stress, the placement of the Yes/No question panicle /-'Is/ can be
used to determine suffixes on the verb from bound and independent panicles
following the verb. The Yes/No question particle must appear at the end of a
phrase. and it prefers to attach to the second phrase in a clause. See Chapter 8.
Section 3.1 for details of its placement. Since it attaches to the end of a
complete phrase. it is the most reliable test for the end of the verb phrase in
~uchee.' In the examples below. (2a) shows that the ability mode te .can' is

(didn't understand or hear/ please repeat)
(frightenedtsurprised)The Yes/No Question particle always bears prominent stress and has the
highes~pitch in the utterance. This is true no matter where it attaches. Its
placement is discussed in Chapter 8, but (92a) provides examples of several of
its possible placements. The Yes/No Question particle can be left off. but this is
rare. When it is, rising intonation indicates the question, as in (92b).

Commands have falling intonation. The primary stress is always the last
syllable of the verb stem. Compare (96a) with (96b) below. In cases of extreme
emotion or emergency, both syllables of the verb may be stressed equally, as in
(96c). However. empathetic commands. or encouragement. normally have
regular stress with the vowel of the stressed syllable lengthened, as in (96d).

capacity, the n6 is stressed and associated with higher pitch.","[124, 125, 126]"
"Postposition Phrases
The Yes/No question particle can appear after a postposition phrase. Thiscan have very little change in scope, as shown in the (24a). However, in general
the 'le on a postposition particle emphasizes the exact placement, and thus
changes the scope from sentential to the location phrase.",[484]
"These verbalized question words are often used as the main clause in
specific information questions. This causes the content verb to be an embedded
clause. Thus, questions such as 'Where did you go?' or 'What is this called?' are
literally 'Where is it that you have been?' and 'How is it that you call this thing?'
Several examples of this construction are given in (38). In (38a) the content verb
'do' in the embedded clause is in the past tense. It is marked with12 'past
imperfective', but (38b) shows that the older past imperfective sh2 used for
embedded clauses is also possible. The example in (38c) also shows that the
content verb 'eat' is embedded since it has requires the begative pre-clitic Itcr-,
which also marks negative embedded clauses.

"The panicle Y creates active verbs out of other pans of speech. Unlike
the nominalizer -Re, which makes nouns from verbs, the verbalizer '2 can make a
verb out of any part of speech. In the majority of cases, '2 creates an impersonal
sentence, or one that begins 'It is...' in English. The verbalizer 5 also has the
aspectual meaning of 'in progress' or temporary.' This is especially apparent
when contrasted with the stative verbalizer le.
The verbalizer '2 is an independent panicle, which, when unstressed,
becomes attached to the stem (a bound word or post-clilic). Verbalizers are
usually part of the stem of the new word (derivation), not a separate word.
However, there is good evidence that the verbalizer 5 is not a suffix on the verb.
First. primary stress regularly falls on the last syllable of a stem. This includes
the nominalizer -ne. When the verbalizer 5 attaches to the end of the stem, it
does not bear primary stress. This indicates that it is not pan of the stem. The
second piece of evidence comes from the placement of the Yes/No Question
panicle 'kc. which comes after complete phrases. In the expression ' a h 2 'it is
that way' below, the Yes/No question panicle le comes between the stem and
the verbalizer.",[307]
"There is a specific question word wakesti 'how far.' It appears to be
made of the stem wa and keshta 'distance.' If the expected response is 'far away'
the question may be nasalized wakhests. The typical question is given in (52a),
followed by several appropriate responses in (52b).",[498]
"E.rcepriona1 Ye Position: Kede
A notable exception to the end of phrase rule is with the adverb kide
how.' Whenever kide is used, the Yes/No question particle is placed betweenthe two syllables, resulting in ke'lide. This apparent infixation is exceptional in
all of Euchee morphology. However, the irrealis modes, including Ye. areverbalizers. And -de is the completed aspect suffix. Therefore, the likely form
of ke'lede is not infixation. but the apsect suffixing to the verbal element 'le. Thisis illustrated below.",[485]
"This implies that there are two postions in the gender phrase. However. it is not

why the normal form sedi is not used. However, it is possible that the I"" Euchee

"The verbalizer -1e attaches to nouns (weather, numerals, and color terms)
and adjectives to create a stative verb. The created state is permanent or
enduring.
Like the active verbalizer -2,the stative verbalizer -1e is not stressed.
Therefore, it is treated as an independent particle which attaches to the stem.
However, unlike the active verbalizer 2, the stative verbalizer -1e is never a
stem. In addition, there is no instance where the Yes/No question particle comes
between the stem and -1e. Instead, the Yes/No question marker -?e is used in
place of the verbalizer -1e. There is no clear evidence. then. that the verbalizer
-1e is ever an independent particle.f
The verbal adjectives and nouns with -le are permanent or enduring
states. In fact, they are so permanent that they are just barely verb-like. Verbs

"5 15This chapter describes how noun phrases, verb phrases (including the
verbals structures), and particles are put together to form longer utterances.
People do many things with language. We make statements concerning the
world around us (declarative sentences). We ask questions, and sometimes
command someone to do or not to do something. Each of these kinds of
utterances has one (or more) specific constructions. Statement, question, and
command forms can then be used for a variety of other functions. For example,
questions can be used to make requests or invitations. Statements can also show
empathy, expectation, or obligation. These functions are shown through the
mode particles and auxiliaries following verbs and are found in Chapter 5. The
first three sections of this chapter describes the construction (syntax) of utterancetypes.","[469, 470]"

"Clitics
Clitics are bound words. The word it binds to in the phrase or clause is
called its host. hust as affixes can be prefixes or suffixes, clitics can attach to
the beginning (pre-clitic) or the end (post-clitic) of a word. Euchee has both preclitics and post-clitics. Unlike affixes, which are bound to a specific part of
speech, clitics attach to a constituent. either a phrase or clause. For example. the
noun classes always move to the end of the noun phrase, so they may appear
after a bare noun, or a quantifier, or an adejctive; they are not always attached
to the noun itself. Since clitics can attach to several different hosts, they are
more loose1y bound than affixes. In Euchee, all one-sy llable independent
particles are stressed. If they are not stressed, due to emphasis elsewhere. they
can become cliticized to a host. The difference between ciitics and independent
words. then, is mainly phonological.
The Yes/No question particle 'le is an irrealis mode particle. It is alwaysan independent word. It is not phonologically reduced, but carries with it a
prominent stress. However, it has characteristics of a clause-level clitic. It
prefers to be after the first complete phrase in a clause, called a 'second position'
clitic. While Ye prefers the second position, it can be placed at the end of any
constituent in the clause. Because of this, it is a good test for constituency in
Euchee, Chapter 8, Section 3.1 Yes/No Questions for examples.
Most of the independent particles can be several phrase-level clitics when
unstressed. These attach to the phrase which they modify, and are typified by
the noun class/determiner post-clitics, the piural particle, the tense particle. This
is similar to the English 'not,' which must be attached to a host when it is
phonologically reduced, as in 'doesn't.'
Only the negative pre-clitic nP- - me- is always attached and can never be
an independent particle. The negative pre-clitic attaches to the besinning of
either the noun or the verb phrase, similar to the English 'I do not have any
urandchildren' and 'I have no grandchildren.'"" The evidence that they are boundr'and not free comes from the fact they follow the stress patterns of the verb and
noun. The negative pre-clitic bears secondary stress of the first syllable,
although they are often emphasized for pragmatic purposes. See Chapter 8.
Section 4 Negation.","[121, 122, 123]"
"See Chapter 8, Section 3.2 for more discussion on the verbal nature of the
question pronouns.",[308]
"In addition, the verbal Wahe?? 'Where is it?' (presented in (37) above)
can not be embedded in another clause for the reading 'where is it rhar ...?' An
embedded question wahe2 is ungrammatical, as seen in (49b) below. The reason
for this is not clear.",[496]
"When a speaker expects that something will take place in the future or
that something is the way it is, the particle )a is used. The expectation )a is
only used with verbal nouns in the present tense, as seen in (80).
