Questions
In this chapter we look at wh-questions and yes-no questions. Whquestions have the syntax of declarative sentences, with the wh-phrase in
place or left-dislocated just like a non-wh-phrase. Yes-no questions have
the syntax of declarative sentences with a final rising tone. We look at
various specialised words used in questions, carrying various
(conventional) implicatures.","[623, 624, 625]"
"20.1. Information ('wh-') questions
In an information question, the questioned phrase is substituted by a 'whphrase' such as àdl 'who', iggS si 'where from', and so on. The whphrase can remain in place, or can be left-dislocated either to the
beginning of its clause, or in some cases to the beginning of a higher
clause. In general, wh-questions appear to have the syntax of equivalent
declarative sentences. Intonation is not distinctive for wh-questions
(unlike yes-no questions which end on a final high tone).

Indirect yes-no questions have two distinct characteristics, both relating to
focus. The subordinate clause is focused, usually either by the standard
event-focusing strategy LOW-?? or by jà + ?? (possibly jà + LOW-??; if
syntactically present the low determiner would be phonologically deleted).

"Final jàFinal jà is found only in subordinate clauses. It is found in both yes-no
and wh-questions; jà is also used in conditionals to express doubt or a
weakened probability, jà possibly functions to affirm, similarly to ra, with
a meaning of 'is it the case that..?'. It is like a gambit, used in shouting
especially where there is a distance between the speakers. Note that there
is no high tone at the end, although it is a yes-no question, jà cannot
terminate an uninflected verb.

"Interpretation of wa with an uninflected (past) verbIf the verb is uninflected, the 'to perfection' reading is generally available.
