"Sentence types 1673. Sentence types
This is the only part where sentence types will be mentioned as a whole and
illustrated in details.
3.1. Questions  content, polar, alternative, echo, indefinite, indirect
There are two major types of interrogative sentences: (a) content or informational questions (as with a wh- word) and (b) polar (yes-no) questions, each
with subtypes. Both typically have a sentence-final falling tone.
i) Content questions: A content question is a request for information that the
speaker expects can or will be supplied by the addressee. It requires an
ignorative word or phrase (nominal or verb; see § 15.2 for six ignorative primary stems  what, who, where, when, how, how many) and a predicate verb
occurs in the interrogative mood (§ 48.2), as opposed to a polar question in ii)
below.
The ignorative word or phrase typically comes at the beginning of a sentence, though it can occur later in the sentence as well.
One question may contain two ignorative words conjoined by the enclitic
|=Ѥu| and as in (49) and (50).
The verb used in a response (a, b) in the following question (32) is not necessarily in the indicative mood as in (a) but is more frequently in the participial
as in (b), which is more reactive or responsive and is typically accompanied by
the reactive enclitic |=wa| (§ 54.1):

"When replying to a negative question, Yupik speakers confirm or deny the
statement made in the question either with the particle ii=i yes or
qaang~qanga no (showing the same pattern as Japanese but not as English),
as in (37a) vs. (b):

No, he has arrived.A polar question with _TDD_ is formally distinguishable from the confirmation of a presumption by the questioner using the particle independently. Compare (a) a polar question with (b) a confirmation:10. It is very common, however, to raise the eyebrow slightly to express yes, often,
though not necessarily, out of shyness. This is not only the case with children.
11. Pragmatically, however, the use of this negative particle may be more or less
avoided, especially where definite negation could not be guaranteed (as in future
events or happenings), in favor of some hedgings such as naamiki I dont know, I
am not sure, aipaagni perhaps (fifty-fifty; aipa-agni partner-LOC.3du.sg.).",[221]

 Deletion of /ܵ/ is blocked in order to meet the maximum two vowel
restriction (§ 3.2).",[263]
"The focus Nukaq for the question by ki-na may stand word-initially or not.
Ignorative words in content questions may either be a particle (how), an inflected adverbial adjunct (why, when, where), or a core or demoted argument (what, who[m], which). Not only intransitive S and monotransitive P
and A, but any ditransitive T, R, or A can be questioned by an ignorative word
and the interrogative-mood verb (as illustrated in § 48.2)  cf. § 35.2.4 for ques-168 Syntactical preliminaries
tions of ditransitive verbs. Content questions are more fully illustrated with
ignorative words (§ 15.2) and interrogative mood verbs (§ 48.2).
Verbs of other moods than the interrogative, however, may also be used to
form content questions, see, e.g. § 47.2 for a participial-mood verb particularly
with the particle |ima| you know.
ii) Polar questions: A polar question, in contrast with the content question
just above, does not occur with an interrogative-mood verb and is characterized
by the rhetorical question particle |qaa| (§ 53.2; instead of an ignorative word). 9
This |qaa| as a particle may occur independently as a free word meaning (is
that) right?  see (38b) for confirmation. But it is typically attached like an
enclitic to the sentence-initial word (except for vocative and interjective words),
nevertheless forming a non-HQFOLWLF ERXQG SKUDVH DV LQGLFDWHG E\  EHORZ
(which triggers a pre-boundary regressive accent, unlike an enclitic =).
Depending upon which constituent is the focus of the polar question, (33)
has different constituent orders. Typically the particle is attached to the word
initial word, forming bound phrases /nùk|kàqqaa/ and /tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tùq|qaa/ with the
regressive accent on the final syllable of the first word:
(33) a. Nùkàq  qaa
tekit-uq?
Has Nukaq arrived?
p.n.ABS.sg.QST arrive-IND.3sg.
b. Tekít-ùq  qaa
Nukaq
Has Nukaq arrived?
arrive-IND.3sg.QST
p.n.ABS.sg.
 thereby showing that the questioning qaa is not an enclitic. Compare with
enclitic bound phrases Nukaq=llu /nùk|kaq|ܾu/ Nukaq also and tekituq=llu
/tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tuq|ܾu/ and he arrived with no regressive accent (*/nùk|kàqܾu/,
*/tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tùq|ܾu/).
A ditransitive verb in polar questions is shown by:
(34)9.","[219, 220]"
"An appositional-mood question may have some difference from an interrogative: a more serious vs. casual.
(19) a. qavci-nek
qimugte-r-luni?
how.many-ABM.pl. dog-have-APP.3Rsg.
how many dogs does he have?  more precise (right now) or serious
question, hence followed by, e.g.
qavci-nek=wa
qimugter-luni, tallima-nek (five-ABM.pl.)
it could be five (a certain number as a reply)
b. qavci-nek qimugte-ngqer-ta?
(dog-have-INT.3sg.)
 casual (anytime) or not so important (just for) question, hence
followed by an answer with uncertainty, e.g. qavcinek=wa
qimugtengqer-ta [MM]Content questions 1355The interrogative word that is obligatory in content questions may be a verb
instead of a nominal or a particle, which should be in the interrogative mood:
(20)Ca-avet
pata-ngnaq-vakar-cit?
do.what-CNNbc.2sg. hurry-CNA-ITS-INT.2sg.

 § 15.2.1.1 for the verbal interrogative word.","[1406, 1407]"
"Has Nukaq arrived?iii) Alternative questions: A coordinate phrase with the alternative particle
|waѤѤu| or (§ 53.5-vi) becomes an alternative question (A or B) with the polar-interrogative particle |qaa| or the alternative |naѤiћլ-| which (§ 15.2.3.2):

"Sentence types 169A response to an polar question typically occurs with the affirmative particle

not obligatory), it is done reactively in the participial mood and with the interactive enclitic |wa| or declaratively in the indicative mood:

One type of content question is an indirect or rhetorical question characterized by the co-occurrence of the enclitic |=kiћլ| I wonder (§ 54.2-iii) attached
to the clause-initial word. It may be a kind of a soliloquy or a question of idle
curiosity that need not be answered by the hearer, although it can also be a
milder and less direct question to which a response is expected. See also (23)
with qaillun how.
The enclitic |=kiћլ| I wonder is typically added to the sentence-initial word
of a content question:

It is interesting to note that the distinction in verb mood that CAY makes between
polar questions (marked by |qaa|) and content questions does not obtain in its closest neighbors Central Siberian Yupik (CSY; Western Eskimo) and Iñupiaq (Eastern), where the interrogative mood is employed for either type of question, but that,
among the neighboring languages, Yukaghir, an isolated Paleosiberian language,
follows exactly the same pattern as CAY, with an interrogative mood and the same
contrast between the two types of questions  see Krejnovich (1982: 150151) and
Endo (1993: 8385).",[220]

eat-APP.3sg.
I did (ate) it.The most neutral and natural answer to the question would simply be the common particle (sentence word) of approval/agreement ii=i yes (§ 53.2). An
indicative verb nere-llru-aqa (eat-PST-IND.1sg.3sg.), with or without the preceding particle, is a flat answer given as a mere fact, while the appositional verb
ner-luku, usually pronounced with a rising tone at the end, is more emphatic
(possibly implying of course).
4.3. Interrogative
An appositional-mood verb may occur independently in questions of content,
which typically require an interrogative-mood verb and an ignorative word
(§ 15.2), though there is a slight difference with the latter.

(b) consisting of the prop verb |pi-| (§ 49.4.2) and an appositional-mood verb

means of the enclitic |=mi| (§ 54.1-ii). Added to the sentence-initial word, it
may induce a question along the line of how about?, although it can just be a
soliloquy:

Content questions may be formed with regard to an element in an embedded
clause in complex verbs (§ 40), which cannot be done with binary questions,
and with regard to a core argument or an adjunct.
Questions are formed with regard to an element in the lower (embedded)
clause in (30), (31a), (32), (33b), but also in the upper clause in (31b), (33a), cf.
concatenated interrogative clauses (§ 4.1.3.1-iii):

Indirect (rhetorical) questions I wonder: |=kiћլ|.............................. 1359
Exclamations by interrogative-mood verbs ...................................... 1360There are a number of types of questions as stated (§ 5.3.1), in particular, content or informational questions (wh-) and binary questions (yes-no), both of
which are typically characterized by a sentence-final (highest) tone rapidly falling, displaying the same intonation as declarative sentences. While binary questions are characterized by the rhetorical question | qaa| (is that right?  sentence adverbial, § 53.2) and no interrogative-mood verb, content questions
obligatorily contain an interrogative word (§ 15.2) and a verb that is generally
in the interrogative mood (this chapter). Content questions are also possible
with verbs in other moods than the interrogative  the participial (§ 47), optative
(§ 49), and appositional (§ 51).
1. Inflection
The inflection for interrogative verbs consists of a mood marker followed by a
subject person marker (intransitive), or a subject-object marker (transitive). As
with the optative, the mood marker has different variants depending upon the
subject person, i.e. |+1ta-| (postconsonantal) ~ |+ћa-| (postvocalic) for the third
person and |+1ci-| for the first and the second person, as indicated by the shaded
portions in Table 47.
The third person marker is illustrated, with an interrogative word implied
(why, when, ):
(1)3sg. |niic[+1ta+Ø|
|nѠћլѠ[+ћa +Ø|

The deletion of the (third-person) mood-marker initial /ܵ/ by (P11) is accompanied by strengthening (geminating) the preceding stem, if it takes the shape of
(C)VC: 3pl. |nѠћլѠ[+ћa+t| >|nѠћլ[+ћat| (P8ii.a) > /n଎Ғܵࡆܵࡆat/ nerat.

3sg.3sg. |niic[+1ta+ћu|
|niic-Ѥћլu[+ћa+ћu| > niitellruaguhe hears it?
he ate it?For the first and the second person markers, the /ci/-plus-apical adjustment
(P13iv) applies as the non-third person mood marker |+ 1ci-|: e.g.
(3)1pl.
2pl.|nѠћլѠ[+ci+ta|
|nѠћլѠ[+ci+ci|> nerceta
> nerceciwe (pl.) eat?
you (pl.) eat?The initial /c/ of the marker is fricativized to /z/ (cf. P2ii.b) after a vowel if
the subject is singular and, though with some fluctuation, after stems that end in
a stop plus /ܺ/ if the subject is non-singular: e.g.
(4)1sg.

(5)2du.3sg. |nѠћլѠ[+ci+tѠћu|> nercetguyou (du.) eat it?The interrogative mood has no first-person subject transitive markers except

When did I see you (sg.)?The gaps in the paradigm are filled with an intransitive person marker,
which is extended to transitive use, without distinguishing the object number:
e.g. 1sg. |+1ci+ƾD| for 1sg.3sg., 1sg.3pl., and 1sg.3du.
(7)kipuc-iiq-si-a?

Which hat (lit., which one of the hats) shall I buy?Note that the interrogative [nali-at naca-t] is an attributive phrase with the first
word (ABS.3pl.sg.) as the head, just like (26b). Although the verb kipuc-iiq-si-aContent questions 1351marks only one person, this is a transitive construction with the phrase as the
object. The same verb could also be used with the plural object nali-it
(ABS.3pl.pl.) which ones (e.g. of the hats).
Likewise:
(8)Ciin kipute-llru-si-a
nacaq / naca-k / naca-tP?
why buy-PST-INT-1sg.[3sg./3du. /3pl.] hat.ABS.sg./-du./-pl.
Why did I buy the hat/hats (du.)/hats?The -si-a verb below is unmistakably intransitive, occurring with an ablative-modalis noun in the singular, dual, or plural.
(9)Ciin kipute-llru-si-a
naca-mek / naca-gnek / naca-nek(P)?
why buy-PST-INT-1sg. hat-ABM.sg./du./pl.
Why did I buy a hat / hats(du.) / hats?
See also § 34(110) pi-ciq-sia.","[1401, 1402, 1403]"
"The question by the appositional verb is a more indirect way of asking or can be
a more serious form of asking (to make sure who are actually coming) than the
compared one by the interrogative verb tai-ciq-at (INT.3pl.), which may not be
an important question, or may be an initial question without a preceding verbal

"2. Content questions
In content questions, an interrogative word (phrase or clause) typically occurs in

mood, as in (10a), but can also be in the appositional  (10b), as well as (21),
(22), (23)  or participial  (24b). As with other moods, tempo-aspectual specification is optional, and an interrogative-mood verb unmarked in this respect is
taken as perfective or continuative.

[arnaq ABS.sg.] who is fat [uquri-lria VNrl.ABS.sg.] is my aunt [anaana-k-aqa
MoSi-have.as-IND.1sg.3sg.]), implying an element of continuation. The compared interrogative verb is likely to be a more isolated question.",[1533]
"Likewise, the interrogative word |qaiѤ(un)| how below also forms a bound
phrase with the following pi-a (whats wrong, what happens) serving as a
marker for indirect questions (I wonder why)  see also § 48.3:

this one to code the content question to the second person (e.g. one behind a
door or over the phone). This is referred to as a disguised person (§ 12.2.3.5,
§ 32.3.2) or pretended use of the third person and may sound formal or polite:

Ignoratives are a class of morphologically diverse words, functionally common,
however, in that they are required in content questions (§ 5.3.1) in which the
head verb selects the interrogative mood (§ 48), and they may subsume not only
ignorative uses (e.g. where, § 15.2) but also non-interrogative uses, i.e. indefinite (somewhere, § 15.3.1) and negative (nowher, § 15.3.2).
There are six ignorative stems, two nominals, two ambivalent, and two particles:

how444 Ignoratives
The three of them |na-| where, |ca-| (to do) what, and |ki(t)-| who have a
limited extent of denominal derivation.
Either nominally or verbally, they inflect only to a limited extent and not all
in the same way. While |ca-| what and |ki(t)-| who inflect for number and
case, |qavciћլ-| how many and |na-| where inflect only for case (but the latter
like adverbial demonstratives). The expanded (nominal) ignorative stems
|na(t)-|, etc. that are derived from |na-| where inflect for person (possessor) 
see § 12.3.3 for |+t-| selected by adverbial demonstrative stems to derive location nouns.
A verbally inflected ignorative word in the interrogative mood functions by
itself as a content (or wh-) question. This is also the case for interrogative clauses that consist of the ignorative |qaillun| how or |ca-| (to do) what and the
generic bivalent stem |pi-| to do; thing (§ 10.3.1) in the causal-connective,
appositional, or participial mood.
Ignorative words used in conjunction with an interrogative-mood verb |pi-| 
e.g. pi-a (INT.3sg.) just below  are frequently used as a kind of set phrase for
expressing uncertainty (e.g. I am not sure how, I cant really say how [but...])
besides their use in asking questions (e.g. how does he, whats wrong with
him?):

"It is possible to add the coreferential marker here. It may be questioned whether or
not the non-occurrence here has a relationship with the characteristic of the perfective suffix  cf. Jacobson (1995: 375) and Miyaoka (1994: fn. 4).",[1489]
"The sentence with the appositional verb seems to be more appropriate in actual
(possibly more serious) situations for precise information, as when it is already
known that someone is using dogs (e.g. aata-ka ikamrar-luni aya-llru-uq my
father [aata-ka ABS.1sg.sg.] left [aya-llru-uq IND.3sg.] with a dogsled
[ikamrar+Ø+luni have-APP.3Rsg.; NV|+Ø-|). On the other hand the compared example with the interrogative-mood inflection sounds like a general,
more isolated, or possibly casual question, and could be a first question uttered
without a preceding context. Likewise:

"587Indirect interrogative clausesAn interrogative clause, either a content (§ 5.3.1-i) or a polar (§ 5.3.1-ii), may
be nominalized into indirect questions (§ 5.3.1-vi), most frequently by the
nominalizer |+(u)ciћլ(kaћլ)-| (§ 18.2.1) and, perhaps less frequently, by |-Ѥћլ(kaћլ)-|
(§ 18.2.2), which is primarily in the past context. The |+(u)ciћլ-| type predominance for this function is understandable, given its implication of uncertainty,
while |-Ѥћլ-| type has typically an implication of particularity and actualization
and certainty. As such, the two may be interchangeable in some cases, but not in
others.
The more common verbs of the main clause which co-occur with interrogative nominal clauses include:
(87) a) secundative ditransitive |apѠc-| to ask
b) bivalent |naѤu-| not to know
c) root |paqna-| curious, check expanded into (monovalent) paqnayug- and (bivalent) paqna-ke-.

"Far beyond this, Can Eskimo be related to Indo-European? was a question raised
by Hammerich (1951).
According to Menovshchikov (1964: 26), it is possible that some essential and
structural differences from all the other Eskimo languages may suggest that Sirenik
people, isolated from other Eskimos for a long period of time, had contacts with
some other linguistic families.",[68]

"Six moods and reflexive third person877or a third party) to the hearer, while the latter is a content question (as contrasted with a binary or yes-or-no question) addressed to the hearer.
ii) The connective mood, which presupposes the main clause with a predicate verb on which it is syntactically dependent, marks a clause subordinate to
another, i.e. main, clause, mostly in adverbial subordination. It has a fair
number of markers that yield different functions (e.g. causal, precessive, conditional, etc.) independently or relative to the main clause. Except for the
stative-connective mood (§ 50.10), it generally expresses a temporal setting or
a causal relationship, depending upon the kind of the connective-mood marker
that immediately precedes the person marker in the verb. A connective-mood
clause and its superordinate main clause, each with its nominal argument(s),
constitute a subordinate complex sentence (§ 5.2.1-ii). A stative-connective
mood is functionally more of an adnominal (non-restrictive or dangling)
clause referring to the S/P argument of the main clause, which is generally the
case with the appositional mood as well (§ 51).
Although typically in a subordinate clause, a connective-mood clause may
occur independently without or instead of an independent-mood clause verb,
with the main clause implied, contextually understood, or abbreviated.
The CAY connective mood is particularly developed and semantically varied, which is assumedly related to the fact that the language simply has very
few subordinate conjunctions (particles). The mood marker is apparently of
nominal origin (or at least partly so, as it is still in a stage of transition), that
is, developed from a nominalizer and a possessed case marker.
iii) Appositional-mood verbs generally form clauses that are cosubordinate
(Michael Olson 1981 cited in Van Valin 1993) to another clause, thus constituting complex sentences (§ 5.2.1-iii). This has a wide range of ostensibly
adverbial functions but is basically a (non-restrictive) adnominal verb (§ 51.5),
basically coreferential to the subject of the main clause, a function that it
shares with stative-connective verbs (as stated above). They may very often
form independent clauses by themselves, however.
Appositional-mood clauses have subjects coreferential with another (main)
clause  thus we encounter the reflexive third person when the latter has the
third person subject. This same-subject principle is not shared by the connective-mood clause (as implied above).
Alone among the six moods, the appositional mood has the morphological
idiosyncrasy of being unipersonal. It has only one person marked inflectionally  S or P argument  even when it is semantico- syntactically transitive. The other (unmarked) person, which is A in the case of transitives, is
known by the same- subject principle (subject coreferentiality) of the mood.","[928, 929]"

"Fish.

S and monotransitive P and A, but any ditransitive T, R, or A can be put into a

Ditransitives compared with extended trivalents................................ 9701. Two types of ditransitives
While CAY shows ergative alignment in the case marking of monotransitives
(as seen in § 34), ditransitive stems with three arguments  T (theme), R (recipient), and A (agent)  show two patterns, secundative and indirective.
Ditransitives here include only primary trivalent stems and secondary
denominal trivalent stems derived with NV suffixes. They do not include derived trivalent verbs with valency increasing suffixes, simplex (§ 39) or complex (§ 40), that is, P E A, P A A IMP, P A A' (from bivalent), S EADV A',
EAPL S A', S AIMP A', or S A' A"" (from monovalent).
The different alignment patterns of these different trivalent constructions 
to be summarized in the table at the end of this chapter  result from the case
assignments in accordance with the argument hierarchy (§ 30).
The two types of ditransitives with T, R, and A are:
(1)1.
2.secundative
(T), [P=] R, A  e.g. to provide with, answer, deprive of, ...
indirective
T [=P], (R), A  e.g. to sell (to), show (to), add (to), .",[992]
"Another type of reply to a question (13) is made without repeating a verb,
that is, (14a) only by a noun or (14b) with the relational verb (to be) instead of
repeating the possessive suffix -ngqer- to have (like pi-ngqer-tua IND.1sg. I
have fish):
