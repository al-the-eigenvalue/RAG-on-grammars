interrogative words noted in the database are either compounds that include verbal or
postpositional roots, or they are morphologically complex in some other way. However,
monomorphemic interrogative words do occur, as well as periphrastic expressions.
Monomorphemic interrogative words include b, and its variant bj ‘what [is
s.t.]’; and d, with the variant dk ‘where [is s.t.]’. The former is homophonous with the
word for ‘thing’, and the latter with the word for ‘eye’. These may optionally co-occur
with other elements, thus highlighting a particular aspect of the question. In (107.c), for167instance, the pronoun bj co-occurs with the purpose marker kacw, placing some
emphasis on the reason for the event or action.(111) a. [M

na3.2. Speech-act distinctions
The declarative, interrogative and imperative speech-acts correspond to morphological
and structural distinctions in Apinajé. Declarative clauses have the structural properties
of the types just introduced.
Polarity questions may be expressed with exactly the same kind of structure as
simple declarative clauses, but with a distinct intonation pattern; or the question may be
introduced by the positional clitic c (alternative form co, depending on the speaker),
which co-occurs with the mode markers, but at absolute clause-initial position (45.a-b).
Information questions are naturally introduced by interrogative pronouns, also at clause
initial position (45.c-d).(45) a. co

‘Which one is sleepy?’There are two strategies for the expression of imperative constructions. One of
them is the use of an irrealis clause whose nominative participant is the addressee of the
command (46.a). This strategy is employed when the speaker is making a request or
giving advice to the addressee. The other strategy is used in more direct commands, and
that is reflected in the structure of the imperative construction (Haiman 1985; Givón
2001: 34-35). Here, no mode marker is employed. The proposition is expressed, instead,
by the bare or inflected form of the verb, depending on its morphosyntactic class. This is
the only construction type in which a transitive verb may display a nominative pattern of
inflection (i.e., it takes the second person prefix, as one might expect of an imperative
context (46.b)).kaj

Verbal clauses have a structure distinct from nominal ones, not only because they –
obviously – are centered around verbal predicators, but especially because they involve
an interesting combination of alignment patterns (cf. section 4).
In the present discussion, I will be employing the notation A, S, and O, proposed in
Dixon (1979, 1994) and later expanded to include E, in Aikhenvald, Dixon and Onishi’s
(2001) framework. The characterization proposed by Dixon for these symbols, as
representing universal syntactic-semantic primitives, has been critiqued by other
linguists. Some of the problems that have been pointed out include (a) inadequacies in the
semantic characterization of these primitives; (b) the fact that their definition is based on
a mixture of semantic and grammatical properties; and (c) that certain languages do not
seem to follow these kinds of patterning, and therefore such primitives should not be
regarded as universal (Mithun and Chafe 1999; Comrie 1978; 1989). Nonetheless, these
symbols are amply used in the literature as a means to refer to core arguments of
transitive and intransitive verbs.
Keeping in mind the problems raised in the literature regarding the theoretical
implications carried by these symbols, in the present discussion I will use them more as
useful mnemonic devices than as strict theoretical constructs. On the other hand, I will
follow the typology proposed in Aikhenvald, Dixon and Onishi (2001) when laying out
patterns of participant marking noted in Apinajé. Once these patterns have been laid out,
I will propose a set of language internal criteria for identifying what relevant grammatical
relations there are in Apinajé (section 4; cf. Dryer 1997).","[238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"
"277As already mentioned, the use of subordination for the expression of
complementation requires that the subordinate verb be in its nonfinite form. The
subordinate clause occupies some position between the matrix verb, which occurs in final
position, and the positional clitics normally occupying sentence-initial position. Since
the complement-taking verbs noted all involve the use of a postposition for marking one
of the core arguments (which could be either A or O, depending on the verb), it is often
the case that the clausal complement will be immediately preceded by this case marker,
when A is the noncanonically marked argument.
The examples in (1.a-d) illustrate the parallel distribution of clausal complements
with that of an O noun phrase. The noun phrase in (1.a) occurs immediately preposed to
the matrix verb (which therefore displays its relational prefix-equivalent form pubu) and
postposed to the dative phrase that indicates the A argument of the verb in question.
In (1.b-c), the subordinate verbs are transitive and intransitive, respectively; the
internal structure of the clausal complement thus reflects this difference in transitivity.
Comparing (1.b) with (1.d), in which both subordinate verbs are transitive, it is possible
to notice the presence of the ergative marker in the latter, but not in the former. The
ergative case marker in (1.d) indicates that the A argument of the subordinate verb is not
coreferential with that of the matrix. The subordinate A arguments is thus overtly
expressed in the embedded clause.(1) a. nai-m [kuke]

verb is slightly different than that of (1). In (1), the matrix verb stem follows a transitive
pattern of inflection, whereas in (2), the matrix verb follows a descriptive pattern of
inflection. That is, in (2), the first argument of the matrix verb is indicated by both an
independent pronoun (when it occurs) and the person prefix attached to the verb. In its
turn, the dative marker attaches to the constituent that refers to the (noncanonically
marked) O argument of the verb in question. When that constituent is a clausal
complement, the dative marker follows the final boundary of the subordinate clause.","[290, 291, 292]"

EThe schematic representation in (48) defines possible clauses types according to
the types of arguments that are obligatorily required in each. Thus, a plain transitive
clause must include A and O; a ditransitive clause must include A, O and a third argument,
which may be expressed morphosyntactically as an indirect object E or as a secondary
object O; a plain intransitive has its single argument S; and an extended intransitive has
two obligatory arguments: S plus another, E, which is typically expressed with oblique
markers. Extended arguments differ from oblique participants or adjuncts in that they are
obligatorily required by the verb.
The fact that some of these core arguments will be marked with adpositions or
case-marking certainly makes it hard to decide whether the participant in question is in
fact a core argument of the verb. Thus, as Onishi wisely points out, “both morphological
and syntactic criteria [are necessary] to determine which arguments should be regarded as
A, S, O and E” (p.2).",[245]
"191A base verb may end in a vowel or in a consonant. In the latter case, it is not
uncommon for an echo vowel to occur after the word final coda. The quality of the echo
vowel is typically the same as that of the nucleus of the syllable in question, except when
the syllable nucleus is /a/: under these circumstances, the tendency is for the echo-vowel
to surface as [i] provided it follows a flap; otherwise, no echo-vowel occurs (145). In any
case, verb stems ending in a consonant do not undergo changes due to nonfinite status,
except for the fact that the echo-vowel does not occur in the nonfinite form. Thus:(145) Consonant-final verbs

apply at a time. In my database, intransitive verbs display these alternations relatively
most frequently.
Suffixation is the most widespread of the three patterns. The consonant suffixes
most commonly found are /, n, r/, although /j, k/ also occur. Phonological motivations
for the distribution of these variants are not obvious. The distribution appears to be
lexically determined, instead. This pattern applies to transitive, intransitive, and to a very

"4. Transcription and other conventions used in the dissertation
In Chapter II – Phonology, I will use symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet
for the introduction of phonemes of the language and the transcription of the data in the
illustrative examples.
Starting in Chapter III – Morphology, the transcription conventions employed in
the remainder of the dissertation assumes, with the segmental analysis proposed, that
prenasal consonants are part of the phoneme inventory of the language; therefore they are
represented as such. Because each of the phonemes in question requires the use of two or
more symbols for its representation, a different set of symbols is adopted for the sake of
economy. Thus, the prenasal consonants /mb, nd, d / are represented thereafter as b, d,34j. Also for the sake of simplicity, the velar nasal consonant / / is represented as g; the
alveopalatal affricate /t/ as c; and the alveolar flap // as r.
Another convention employed in this dissertation is that, for cross-referencing to
sections belonging to a different chapter, I will include the number of the relevant chapter
immediately before the section number, as in V.1.2, for “section 1.2 of chapter V”.","[47, 48]"
"31. The Apinajé people
A distinguishing feature of Jê groups is the contrast between their relatively simple
technology and their highly elaborate social organization. Jê material culture is noted for
basketry techniques, but it does not include, for example, hammocks, canoes or ceramics.
Jê social organization, on the other hand, is characterized by an intricate system of
moieties and men’s groups, rules of proper name transmission, and a relationship
terminology that ignores the generational distinction principle (Da Matta 1982; Carneiro
da Cunha 2004). According to Da Matta’s interpretation, the Apinajé universe is ruled by
a principle of dualism whereby elements at all dimensions are placed in a relation of
complementary opposition thus constituting necessary parts of a closed totality.
Apinajé cosmology, social and physical organization is permeated by this
dualism, which is not as much hierarchical as it is dialectic. This may be observed in the
Apinajé creation myth, according to which all things existing on Earth were created by
Sun and Moon. Sun, the older character, is the initiator, the one who poses a particular,
harmonic state of affairs. Moon, the younger character, is the antithetical element, the
one who questions the order and brings chaos into the status quo. The result of this
interaction is a thesis that justifies the dual aspect of all creation in both nature and
culture. Thus, animals, colors, name sets, ceremonial roles, among other things, are
divided in pairs which are directly associated with either one or the other mythical
character; and the members of each pair stand in a kind of inalienable relationship, for the
existence of one is only justifiable by the existence of the other (Text I, Appendix B).","[16, 17]"

Keenan (1976) proposes a set of criteria, which may apply to different languages to a
greater or lesser extent, for a definition of Subject as a universal category. The idea of
grammatical relations as a universal category has been questioned by Dryer (1997), who254points out that, while a set of criteria may be helpful to establish what similarities there
are amongst languages, these similarities do not explain why languages are the way they
are. Any similarities are, he claims, the reflexes of functional and cognitive processes
which themselves may be universal. Thus, it is not grammatical relations as such that are
universal. Each language displays its own relevant grammatical relations, which may or
may not coincide with the notions of “Subject” and “Object” as found in other languages.
In the analysis of Apinajé, I share Matthew Dryer’s view that the grammatical
relations of a language are specific to that language and may be defined according to
language internal criteria. In section 3.3 I have pointed out how distinct systems of
alignment interact in Apinajé. Thus, coding patterns and control properties relevant for
the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé include:(82) Relevant criteria for the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé
(a) word order
(b) person prefixes
(c) independent pronouns
(d) person inflection in imperative clauses
(e) the use of reflexives
(f) the occurrence of the realis marker in noun phrase coordination
(g) switch-reference strategies
(h) valency-changing operations
(i) ergative marking in subordinate clauses
(j) equi-deletion in complementation
(k) coreferential deletion in coordinationThe SOV word order (criterion (a)) is fairly rigid in Apinajé and serves as a useful
criterion of the identification of A and O. The use of person prefixes (b) reveals a split-255intransitive system in simple main clauses, and an absolutive pattern in nonfinite clauses.
To go along with the absolutive pattern, criterion (i) reveals an ergative case-marking
system that is conditioned by subordination environments. All other criteria (c-h; j-k)
betray a nominative pattern and provide strong support for the grammatical relation
Subject in Apinajé.
On the other hand, Direct Object is a less robust grammatical relation in the
language. The O argument forms a tight constituent with the following verb, and if the O
does not occur as a free form, then a personal prefix on the verb must index the person of
O. In addition to this morphosyntactic pattern, the accusative prefix set contains a uniqueform, the prefix ku-, which is the one criterion that unquestionably identifies the Direct
Object. Note that these criteria only identify the canonical O as Direct Object, leaving no
syntactic or morphological evidence for the combination of the canonical O category with
the many proposed noncanonical O arguments: these latter bear case-markers, cannot be
indexed on the verb, and show no evidence of constituency with the V. As such, we push
them to the next category, that of Indirect Object.
If Direct Object in Apinajé is not particularly robust, the evidence in favor of the
grammatical relation Indirect Object is limited to a single criterion: obligatoriness. In the
traditional ditransitive predicates, the third argument bears the dative case-marking, and
in the various noncanonical verb types seen in section 3.3.2, the second argument bears
one of four different case-markers, lexically determined by the verb. Thus, the category
of Indirect Object could be defined as those obligatory arguments that otherwise have no
morphological or syntactic patterns to unite them.","[266, 267, 268, 269]"
"In the first construction (‘SBJ will X, then SBJ will Y’), the particle ri is
immediately postposed to the clause(s) describing the first event in the sequence; the
clause expressing the second event occurs last in the sentence. In the examples below,
the two events in sequence share the same subject, so the subject is mentioned only once
at the beginning of the sentence.
Example (16.b) is more complex in that the first event of the sequence consists of
two clauses – i.e. two minor events: the wait for the potatoes to cook, and the cooking of
the potatoes. Within that domain, the subjects of the first and second events are distinct,290thus the different-subject third person conjunction occurs in the second clause. Although
there is no structural evidence of subordination between the clauses expressing the first
and second events, the ‘cook’ clause stands in a complement-type relation with the ‘wait’
clause, albeit semantically. For the purposes of the construction being described in the
present section, those two clauses are taken here as if constituting a unit.(16) a. Kt paj

event that should happen last in the sequence; the particle ri occurs postposed to this
clause and the negator ket modifies its predicate.(17) a. Kt paj

whether that clause indicates the initial or the final event of the sequence depends on the
occurrence of the negative marker ket.
Some aspects in the overall structure of ri constructions which show that the rimarked clause is in fact structurally subordinate to that in sentence-final position are as
follows. In examples (16.a) and (17.b), repeated as (18) below, the sentence-final clauses
have the typical distribution of a main predicate, and the subject of each is that expressed
by the nominative pronoun at the beginning of the whole complex sentence. As for the
ri-marked elements, they have the distribution that a postpositional phrase would have,
and they come marked with a postposed particle that, in other contexts, may function
either as a demonstrative or a locative. An alternative semantic interpretation of the rimarked expressions in the examples below then could be, respectively, ‘at/upon/when
[clause]’. Hence the alternative translations:(18) a. Kt paj

The morpheme kutep marks a temporal adverbial construction, which consists of
clauses that encode simultaneous events. The clauses in question do not occur in a
subordinating relation: they occur in a paratactic relation with one another and each has
its own subject. That the clauses involved belong in the same sentence is indicated by the
fact that they fall under the scope of the same mood marker; and by the intonation pattern
of the utterance, which clearly includes them both.
The morpheme kutep is a postposition that indicates something like ‘in one’s
stead’. Functionally, it clearly indicates the simultaneous relation between the events
described in each clause. As to its distribution in the sentence, it occurs in the clause that
serves as the ground event with respect to which the other, simultaneous event is located.
The person index occurring in kutep refers to the subject of the second, “figure”
clause in the temporal relation, as expressed by agreement with the independent pronoun.(19) a. Ktka

v.intr. stand in vertical position (of one or a pair of objects or people). Nonfinite form
and inflectional pattern: S=cm; alternating form: S=car. Semantics: The semantic
contrast between this verb and kue appears to be that the former indicates movement
towards standing position, whereas the latter indicates being in that position.
However, only ca seems to occur in constructions that require position verbs,
indicating, in this case, something already in standing position. This hypothesis is at
odds with the morphological class of each verb and their correlation with descriptive
and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is that the contrast may have to do with the
number of participants, ca being the singular and kue the plural counterpart. A third
hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be standing’, but with the semantics of kue
focusing on the resultative aspect of getting up, and ca not having such connotation.
Ex.: Pa na pa ca. ‘I’m standing (here).’ Ktm ca. ‘Stand up (few people).’ Na ka va

"3.4.3. Possessive predicates
Possessive predicates (e.g. “I have a sister”) expressed by juxtaposition in Apinajé share
some structural details with equative predicates, namely, the free pronoun must precede245the modality marker, but here it must be coreferential with the prefix on the predicate;
these morphemes refer collectively to the possessor (66.a). If the coreferentiality
condition is not met, then the construction will functionally constitute an equative
nominal predicate (66.b).(66) a. pa

DEMnaRLSIt is evident that the construction in (66.a) is structurally identical to that
expressing proper inclusion predicates introduced above (cf. (64)). Nonetheless, the
interpretation here is one of possession because the nominal predicate has an inanimate,
non-human referent. When asked whether one could get a proper inclusion interpretation
out of example (66.a), as in “I am a knife,” consultants rejected the possibility and
offered copula constructions, instead (67).(67) a. [pa na]

person prefix attached to the copula pe, such that free pronouns are optional (67-68).

inalienable noun in predicate position refer to a possessor, which is non-coreferential
with the subject of the clause; compare (69.a-c) with (69.d).

obligatorily present under such coreferentiality conditions (70).(70) napa

wash3.5. Locative predicates
Locative predicates follow the same pattern as verbal clauses, since they involve position
verbs, which are typically intransitive. Thus, this clause type includes the mood marker,
the subject nominal, the locative adverbial and a position verb, such as ca ‘stand’,  ‘sit’,
or other, depending on the number of the absolutive argument (section III.3.1.2.3.)(71) a. ktkaj

Existential predicates are structurally similar to locative predicates, except that in these
constructions the verb is dispensed with. The necessary elements are simply the location
and the referent located, which typically comes accompanied by a quantifier or the
existential negative amrakati in the predication.(72) a. go

‘Around here there is a lot of farinha de puba and farinha seca.’3.7. Negation
Negation is another dimension whereby clauses can be subcategorized into structural
types. Negation applies differently depending on the type of predicate being negated.
Nominal predicates are negated with the clause-final clitic ket, verbal predicates with the
clitic sequence ket=ne, whereas existential predicates can be negated either with ket or249the negative existential pronoun amrakati; apparently, some negated locative predicates
(section 3.5) may function as negative existentials as well, except that these predicates
are characterized by the use of positional verbs in predicate position which are, therefore,
negated with ket=ne.
On the other hand, for any of these clause types, the expression of negation is not
affected by the mode (realis or irrealis) or speech-act (declarative, interrogative,
imperative) distinction of the clause.
The negation of juxtaposition nominal predicates, expressed by the simplex
negative ket, is illustrated in (73). (There are no examples of negated copular predicates
available in the database.) The examples (73.c-d) demonstrate that the complex negative
marker is not preferred in this syntactic context.","[258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263]"

cl. phrase-final clitic, nominalizer of agent. Grammar: This morpheme occurs in
relative clauses indicating the relativized noun, which may be a subject or object.
Structurally, it is placed at the end of the relative clause and is followed by the definite

ne, which expresses temporary state or condition, in this context. Ex.: Ata na mduju.
‘This one (over there) is bad.’ Ata na m mduj tjc kumrc. ‘That one is really
mean!’ Na pa icpuduju. ‘I’m ugly/mean/sickly.’ Na pa icpuduj ne. ‘I look ugly/am

v.tr.noncan. tie; fasten. Inflectional pattern: OE=m e; no relational prefix. Grammar:
a. One piece of evidence of the absence of a relational prefix for this verb is the
ungrammatical form *aje (for “tie [it] up!”). b. When there is a beneficiary, the clause
will contain two dative-marked nominals: one being the beneficiary and the other the
dative-marked, extended O. c. This verb contrasts with pr, katpr in that it may have
a participial reading with no change in form. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Kt paj pi

e! ‘Tie it up!’ B pip muj, na m ra km e. ‘That drunk man, they’ve tied him up.’

As a general rule, Apinajé plosives have voiced and voiceless allophones, with the
voiceless counterparts appearing at the onset of stressed syllables, and the voiced ones
occurring in more marginal positions, such as non-stressed syllables and coda position.
Although this is the most frequent distributional pattern, it is possible on occasion to find
alternation between voiced and voiceless allophones in less prominent positions as well.
The conditions for the distribution of each phoneme’s variants are presented next.","[54, 55, 56, 57]"
"2243.1. Mode distinctions
The realis and irrealis encompass all clause structure types in Apinajé. That is, clauses
are either realis or irrealis, structurally. From a semantic and functional perspective, the
realis mode includes past, present, habitual – negative, positive or interrogative –
propositions. The irrealis mode comprises future, hypothetical, counterfactual,
conditional, intentive – negative, positive, interrogative and some imperative –
propositions. Speech act distinctions therefore do not interfere with mode distinctions,
for the most part (except for one type of imperative, as will be seen below).
The realis mode is encoded by the positional clitic na. As a general rule, this
marker indicates the clause initial boundary and is typically followed by a free pronoun,
which encodes the nominative argument of the clause. Tense-aspect distinctions are
expressed elsewhere in the clause, often by clitic sequences postposed to the nominative
pronoun, or by clause final clitics, subordinators, or serial constructions (41).(41) a. napa

FCT‘That one used to lie.’The irrealis mode is encoded by the positional clitic kt. This clitic also indicates

"298The morphosyntactic and distributional facts about the negative morphemes
suggest that they may have all originated diachronically from verbal sources. At least in
regard to the morpheme ket, a plausible hypothesis is that it must have started out as a
monosyllabic negative predicator of tV structure, and that the kV- syllable is a reflex of
the accusative prefix ku-, also noted in other function words, such as kumrc ‘INTS’ and
kt ‘3.ERG’, among others (see chapter IV). The hypothetical predicator *tV must have
been responsible for the negation of the proposition described in the clause, thus
requiring the nonfinite form of the subordinate verb; whereas the morpheme ku- could
have operated as an anaphoric/resumptive pronoun, referring back to the negated
proposition. Verbs do take noun phrases as arguments; and it is quite possible that the
distribution of ku- was restricted to cases of propositional, not nominal, negation in a past
stage of Apinajé.1 However, since the most frequent scope of negation is the proposition,
the use of the *kVtV form may have become more standardized, leading to its reanalysis
as the negative stem of Apinajé thus replacing other related forms elsewhere in the
grammar. As far as phonological changes, one could speculate a path such as *kute >
*kete > ket, for Apinajé, with vowel harmony and eventual deletion of the stem final
vowel. In any case, it is no longer possible to speak of ket and ketne as true verbs in1In Kaingang (Southern Jê), one of the negative markers is indeed a monosyllabic morpheme beginning in
/t/: tõ ‘NEG’ (Wiesemann 1986). However, in that language this form of the negative is employed in narrow
scope negation, specifically, in the negation of nouns; sentential negation is expressed by a similar ket
morpheme. (Thanks to Eduardo Ribeiro for calling my attention to this piece of data, in personal
communication.)299Apinajé. These morphemes have now become positional clitics which do not display the
full morphosyntactic behavior and semantic content of a lexical verb.
Other elements that may have involved the prefix ku- in earlier times include the
ergative markers and the intensifier kumrc. While it seems plausible that the intensifier
may have evolved from a verb, given its final position in the clause and the role it
performs, as a modifier of the predicate, the same may not be said of the ergative
markers.
The ergative markers t and kt must have evolved from a nominal source. My
claim is based on their distribution in the sentence and their function in present-day
Apinajé syntax, as case markers of nominal elements. However, the possibility that the
prefix ku- may have participated in the development of the suppletive third-person form
of the ergative is also present here – a path that I propose for the other two postpositions
that display suppletive forms, namely, the detrimentive and the dative, as well. The
hypothesis is displayed schematically below:(1)*ku-m

kt‘3.DAT’
‘3.DTR’
‘3.ERG’The idea proposed in (1) is that all three postpositional markers may once have
been used with the third person prefix ku. With the frequency of use, the vowels involved
underwent certain phonological changes, such that non-low vowels ended up in full
harmony, whereas in the environment of a low vowel, only partial asimilation took place,300such that the high back vowel became lowered. Eventually, all word-final vowels were
lost, giving way to a heavy monosyllabic word.
In this vein, it is hoped that this description of Apinajé will serve as a basis for
future historical and comparative work, which will allow the testing of the various
internal reconstructions proposed here, and which will also allow the creation of new,
fruitful comparative hypotheses for the reconstruction of the phonology and grammar of
Proto-Jê.","[311, 312, 313, 314]"

Alternate form: akund. Phonology: In the context of an identical subsequent vowel,
there is an epenthetic flap [r] that separates the two, as in icpikudr  mõ. Grammar:
This verb has a bivalent version,  akudk. Ex.: Pa kt paj akud. ‘I’m going to
disappear.’ Ka na ka akud. ‘You’re going to get lost.’ Pa kt paj icpikud ketne. ‘I’m

v.intr.noncan. play; enjoy onself. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: Although the
ami kati
reflexive marker occurs with this verb, the reflexive-verb root pair have become
lexicalized as a single predicator. The word kati by itself means ‘waist’; there is no
evidence for its use as a verb. In addition, the compound predicator may apparently
have its valency increased by means of the morpheme , in  ami kati. Ex.: Na pa366ami) kati c‡´ami kati. ‘I played/enjoyed myself.’ Na pa at ami kati. ‘I enjoyed myself with

v.tr. 1. place one object or a pair of objects of the same kind (e.g. a pair of sandals)
into a deep recipient (e.g. a basket, a box, or a bag). 2. serve food (as a mass concept)
in a deep container (e.g. a bowl). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=c-.
Nonfinite form: r. Semantics: This verb contrasts with such others as me, re and gje
on the basis of the category of number, among other details. Morphology: The verb 
‘serve’ is almost homophonous with the verb r ‘cook’, except that the former has a
different finite form and a relational prefix, and the latter has the same form in both
finite and nonfinite positions, and it has no relational prefix. Ex.: Na ktm meõ kw
cr  ca. ‘She is still serving herself to some food.’ Te ne amim meõ kw c ne ip
amim meb ata kw re. ‘Go help yourself to some food, get yourself some of these

v.tr.der. 1. race someone. 2. run after someone. Inflectional pattern and relational
prefix: O=t- A=krikrit. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: In this form, the morpheme
 takes a relational prefix. Ex.: Na prti brekr  krikrit um ubaj prõt. ‘The truck
raced after the seriema and it ran out of fear.’ Ict akrikrit ketne. ‘Don’t run after me.’
Na wa atpen t krikrit. ‘The two of them are racing each other.’ Na ka wa atpen t
akrikrit ketne. ‘The two of you are not racing one another.’ See krikrit.
v.intr. sit. Nonfinite form: S=r. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb
and kri appears to be that the former indicates movement towards sitting position,
whereas the latter indicates being in sitting position. However, only  seems to occur
in constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case, something already
in sitting position. This hypothesis is at odds with the morphological class of each
verb and their correlation with descriptive and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is
that the contrast may have to do with the number of participants,  being the singular
and kri the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be sitting’,
but with the semantics of kri focusing on the resultative aspect of sitting down, and 
not having such connotation. Grammar: a. This verb is used in VV constructions,
indicating progressive or continuative aspect. b. The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and  ‘sit’ contrast
with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in that the former seem to have a more
flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of the absolutive, than the latter. It421ˆ)rkuremis possible to find examples of m nõ and m , even though these verbs refer
basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw are often not found with
singular absolutives. Ex.: Pip  muj  . ‘Sit on that bench.’ See r, kri.
v.tr. sit one person or two people on a particular place. Inflectional pattern and
relational prefix: O=-r. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Ja mu atõ pip  r. ‘Sit your
brother on that stool.’ Pip ata  r ketn d pip ata mduju, ra pikuke. ‘Don’t sit
him on this bench [near you] because it is bad, it is broken.’ D , pa ict  ar kete.

v.tr. 1. place one or a pair of objects right-side up on a surface (e.g. table, counter or
ground). 2. place (a pot or pan of food) on the fire so as to cook. Inflectional pattern
and relational prefix: O=c-m. Nonfinite form: same. Semantics: This verb (as well as
its counterpart ujw) is used with reference to objects shaped in such a way that allow
the speaker to conceive of them as “standing up”, such as plates or cups. Its use would
be more problematic with objects such as forks and knives, for instance, since these
kinds of objects are typically laid in horizontal position. Ex.: Kt paj ami m kuw

"3.1.2.3.Lexical pairs
Plural Stems vs. NonPlural Stems. Apinajé displays verb pairs which encode basically
the same semantics, but contrast in the number of the absolutive argument. The contrast
seems to lie in a distinction between plural, on the one hand, and singular, dual, or mass
absolutives (termed here “non-plural”), on the other. Both bivalent verbs and monovalent
verbs may have such pairs; in the case of monovalents, each member of the pair may
come from a distinct class – intransitive and descriptive. Most such monovalent verb129pairs consist of movement and position verbs (60). Transitive verb pairs include a
broader range of meanings, from position manipulation to ingestion, to killing (61).(60) a. Descriptives:

INTR-INTR130The pair ku/kre encodes an interesting distinction: here, the contrast is not so
much in quantity, but whether the absolutive argument consumes a diversified meal,
consisting of servings of different foods (ku); or whether the participant ingests food of a
single kind, regardless of the quantity or number (kre). Additionally, there is an
independent distinction between these two stems, with the possibility of kre indicating a
more perfective action, ‘swallow’, in some contexts, whereas ku is unmarked for that
distinction.
The items te/mõ contrast with bra in terms of absolutive number: bra typically
refers to a large number of persons walking together, wandering. On the other hand, te
‘go’and mõ ‘go (wandering)’ also contrast, the former indicating straighforward
displacement, and the latter indicating a more slow-paced, maybe wandering, motion.
Both te and mõ may occur in the non-singular, the number category then being indicated
by the particles wa and m (section 3.2.2.5). However, the stem bra seems less flexible
in this respect: apparently, it refers necessarily to a collective band.","[142, 143, 144]"

‘after; behind’The echo-vowel indicates the end of a phonological word. It occurs most often in
content words, though there are instances of echo-vowels in function words too. The
morphemes ket and kot, in (96), are a negative particle and a postposition, respectively.
The fact that these units are prominent within their respective constituents might
be one reason why these function words – and not others – tend to display echo-vowels.
Both particles and postpositions occur phrase-finally and thus have better chances of
appearing in utterance-final position, the locus of echo-vowels.
An independent hypothesis for why ket and kot display a property characteristic of
content words is that both, particle and postposition, must derive historically from content
words – a verb and a noun, respectively (chapter III). The occurrence of echo-vowels
may be one feature that indicates their diachronic origin.","[92, 93]"

‘You are cold.’FCTAt a closer look, one could hypothesize that the predicator in these cases may be
taking a zero third person marker, in which case the predicator could not be adequately
descibed as monovalent. The difficulty with confirming this hypothesis is that, in some
cases, a regular verb adopts an alternative form which is specific to this kind of
predication. Take the example of m kr ‘feel cold’: elsewhere, the form of the predicator
is akr ‘be.cold’, which may take person inflection, thus also employing the relational
prefix j-. In the case of a zero third person form, the relational prefix would not occur; but
the formative a- would not be lost either. Therefore, the best criteria for deciding whether
these are mono- or bivalent predicators, and even whether the participants marked with
postpositions are or are not core arguments, must come from syntax. For the time being,
I will simply lay out the morphological patterns involved, and will postpone a discussion
of the syntactic evidence until section 4.",[248]
"297CHAPTER VICONCLUDING REMARKSIn the previous chapters I have provided an overview of the core aspects of Apinajé
grammar – its phonology, morphology, simple clause syntax, and complex constructions
and predicates. Despite its preliminary character, the description presented here is
intended as a fresh contribution to the study and documentation of Apinajé, especially
because, for the first time, the morphology and syntax of the language are treated in detail
and from a non-formalist perspective. The functional-typological approach adopted in
the present study has made possible a richer and more fluid anaysis of the data, especially
in regard to certain puzzling patterns, such as the association of subordinating
morphology with certain domains of the grammar.
It has been noted, for instance, that the negative clitics not only require such
morphology, but display a morphological make up that may be seen as evidence for a
verbal diachronic origin, namely, the consonant k-, analyzed here as a reflex of the third
person accusative prefix. Other factors that have been considered are its clause-final
position and its possiblity of occurrence with the clitic ne. The presence of this clitic
suggests an affinity of the form ket with the class of descriptive verbs, in that some of
them often co-occur with the morpheme ne. These are simple observations, however, and
need to be further investigated.","[310, 311]"
"184Verbs. Relational prefixes occur in the finite forms of transitive and descriptive verbs,
but only in the nonfinite forms of intransitive verbs, which do not take person marking in
any other environment.
The inventories of relational prefixes for transitives and descriptives are very
similar: they consist mostly of coronal segments, although both also include a few
instances of the segment p- as applied to u-initial stems. The examples in (140)
illustrate the range of relational prefixes observed in transitive and descriptive verbal
stems.(140) a. Transitives

elements, but – crucially – only intransitive verbs display the form pi-, which applies to
base stems beginning with a specific middle prefix. The set of relational prefixes
observed in intransitive verbs is displayed in (141). Notice how distinct the pattern is
from the other two sets: not only does pi- occur exclusively in this set, but it seems to be
the preferred choice. The stem acquires a consonant-initial form, once pi- has been
attached to it.","[197, 198, 199]"

uuoõ61The inventory of Apinajé vowel phonemes proposed here differs from Ham
(1961) in that (a) it includes the schwa / / as a distinctive segment and (b) it excludes the
nasal central low vowel /ã/ present in Ham’s proposal, which I have not attested in my
data. In other words, the present phoneme inventory includes four (not three) mid central
vowels – three orals and one nasal; in addition to two high central vowels (oral and
nasal), and one low central vowel.
From a typological viewpoint, the proliferation of contrastive vowels occurs most
commonly in the front space of the vocal tract. Thus, if the analysis proposed here is
correct, the occurrence of five central (oral) vowel phonemes is a typologically
uncommon fact about Apinajé. However, the distinction between two of these midcentral phonemes, /, /, is also attested in at least four other Northern Jê languages:
Suyá, Tapayúna, Parkatejê, and Krahô.
Independent support for the segmental analysis proposed here comes from
historical-comparative evidence as well. An ongoing study on the development of
present-day vowel systems in Jê languages reveals a phonological correspondence of the
Northern Jê mid-central vowels /, / to the mid-high and mid-low front vowels /e, / of
Central Jê languages, respectively (Oliveira and Ribeiro 2005).
As for the schwa / /, so far its phonemic status in Apinajé seems to be attested by
minimal and analogous pairs, as will be shown below. However, because of the
typologically questionable existence of three contrastive mid-central vowels in any
phonemic inventory, an eventual acoustic analysis might prove useful for an accurate62phonetic characterization of this segment in particular, such that it can be contrasted with
the phonetic properties of the other two mid-central vowels /, / found in the language.
If the phonetic and phonemic distinctions amongst the three segments become
further confirmed by an acoustic analysis, then the addition of the schwa / / to the
phoneme inventory may have been a phonological innovation of Apinajé. One functional
motivation for this diversification of contrastive vowels could be the fact that morphemes
in Apinajé are monosyllabic, and phonemic distinctions help maintain semantic
distinctions amongst morphemes by avoiding homophony.
The contrasts amongst vowel phonemes are illustrated in (50-56).(50) a. /i/ x /e/

"164The alternation between m õ, wa õ and m u, wa u appears to be phonetically
motivated; these pronouns seem to result of a combination of the indefinite pronoun õ
with each of the number markers m and wa.
In addition to these two pronouns, the form mbj ‘something’ also consists of
two morphemes, the plural/nonreferential marker m plus bj ‘thing’. This form also
serves as an interrogative pronoun, as will be seen.(109) a. Ka

ne, and stems formed with the deitic tar. The latter morpheme occurs in the
demonstratives ictar ‘here’, atar ‘there.PRX’ and mutar ‘there.DST’. Although the
morpheme tar is morphologically and semantically comparable to postpositions, in that it165takes person inflection and is deictic in nature, its distribution is restricted to the lexical
items just presented; that is, tar does not occur productively as head of postpositional
phrases. In addition, its semantic content is not transparent, if analyzed in isolation.
The word ja has the primary function of a definite article within a noun phrase;
muj and atar are demonstratives that operate either as full pronouns or as determiners of
the noun. The present section focuses on the pronominal role of these markers. For
details about their function, distribution, and morphological properties within the noun
phrase, see section IV.2.1. The forms ictar and mutar are used mostly as locatives and are
not discussed here.
The semantic contrast between ja and muj is that the former operates as a
proximal demonstrative pronoun, while the latter is a distal demonstrative. When in
demonstrative function, ja is typically stressed; thus, the root-initial glide /j/ is realized as
a voiced alveo-palatal fricative [z]. Ja does not seem to carry any specification as to a
particular deictic center: it may indicate a referent close to both speaker and listener,
away from both, or close to either one or the other. On the other hand, muj and atar do
each refer to a particular deictic center.
The demonstrative muj ‘that’, which has the alternate form mu (apparently
phonologically motivated), points to a referent away from listener and speaker. Atar ‘that
[close to you]’ consists of the second person prefix a- and the deictic morpheme tar. The
presence of the second person prefix is overt indication of the deictic center for this
demonstrative.","[177, 178, 179]"

go3. Clause structure
In what follows, the various types of main clause structure are introduced. It will be seen
that some of the variation found in verbal clauses is due to the major distinction between
the realis and irrealis mode, as well as to speech-act distinctions, especially the contrast
between affirmative and negative sentences. Other differences in the structure of verbal
clauses are due to the morphosyntactic nature of the predicators involved, namely, those
that entail the standard pattern of argument marking already introduced (sections III.3.2.1.
and III.4.1.1), as against those predicators that involve non-canonical patterns of argument
marking.","[236, 237]"
"54The intention here is to propose an analysis alternative to Ham (1961), one that
takes into consideration the existing contrastive pairs. I then propose three (not two)
series of related phonemes – stops, nasals, and prenasal stops –, noting that the contrast
between nasals and prenasal stops is observable only before nasal vowels, as illustrated
by the following examples.(32) a. /na/

//, where an oral velar transition [k, g] appears before oral vowels but not before nasal
vowels (section 1.1.2, examples (37-38)). Obviously, this historical hypothesis needs to
be tested through comparative analysis. This is a task that is beyond the scope of this
dissertation, and therefore will be postponed.","[67, 68]"

Spike GildeaThe dissertation is a preliminary grammatical description of the language spoken
by the Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. It discusses the core
facts about Apinajé phonology, morphology and syntax from a functional-typlogical
perspective, and provides three appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of texts
and a preliminary dictionary. The phonological analysis proposes an alternative
interpretation for the inventory of phonemes as compared to earlier analyses, pointing to
phonemic distinctions not previously noted, which might lead to interesting findings
regarding the historical development of the language. Apinajé morphemes are typically
monosyllabic and the language makes ample use of function words for the expression of
grammatical categories, properties that are characteristic of analytic languages.
Nonetheless, Apinajé morphology is more complex than it might seem at first, especially
with respect to the major lexical categories of the language: Nouns, Verbs andv
Postpositions. These word classes, especially Nouns and Verbs, are characterized
morphologically by the presence of formatives, which are recurrent morphs that are either
semantically empty or of elusive meaning, but which subcategorize words in formal or
semantic terms. The categories of nonfiniteness, person, and syntactic constituency
constitute the core of inflectional morphology, the last applying to nouns, postpositions,
and verbs. Verbs are subcategorized morphosyntactically into transitives, intransitives
and descriptives, displaying a split intransitivity system with respect to verbal personmarking. Word order is predominantly SOV. Syntactically complex constructions
include verb serialization and clause subordination, with ergative case-marking a
characteristic of subordinate clauses.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"

goSome alternative hypotheses are possible for the analysis of the morpheme  in
this context, since this marker appears in various positions with distinct meanings, in the
grammar of the language. One hypothesis could be that  is the instrumental postposition
in the examples above, and that would even justify the nonfiniteness of the preceding
verb; after all, in order for it to be the object of a postposition, it must be more nominal
than verbal – and that is what nonfinite verb forms are, in Apinajé.
Another hypothesis is that the morpheme  appearing in these contexts is the
transitive verb ‘do’, which likewise could require a more nominal form of the lexical
verb. According to this interpretation, the sequence of elements involved could be
analyzed as a case of verb serialization, including the lexical verb, the verb , and the
movement or position verb.","[308, 309]"
"48The presence of the echo-vowel favors the occurrence of voiced allophones.
Retroflexed allophones [, ] tend to occur in the context of non-coronal vowels6, and the

those produced elsewhere (Lahiri and Evers 1991; Clements 1985).
7The following example illustrates one instance of the flap allophone in the context of a non-coronal
vowel. Here, the condition for this allophone to occur at syllable coda is presumably the nasality of the
vowel at the nucleus (the flap does not occur in the context of oral /o/, as demonstrated in (18.a)),

the absence of sonorant consonants in example (31.a) and the presence of the voiceless
allophones. Contrast with (31.b), where the word/syllable begins with a prenasalized
consonant. The voice properties of the pre-nasal phoneme favor the occurrence of the
voiced allophones [d, d]; so does the presence of echo-vowels (31.b-c).(31) a. /apet/[apet]

[m vakadi]‘fangs’53Prenasalized Stops. The labial and coronal prenasal(ized) phonemes /mb, nd, d/ are
voiced complex segments consisting of homorganic nasal-obstruent contours. Their
distribution is restricted to stressed syllable onset, word initially and medially. The
prenasal stops contrast with nasal consonants before oral vowels, but they do not contrast
before nasal vowels. In addition, there is no contrastive prenasalized velar stop, and the
number of contrastive pairs for the series is rather small, amounting to only six or seven
pairs in my database.
Under such restrictive conditions, one might be inclined to interpret such pairs
merely as “exceptions.” Although this is an easy enough solution, it obscures a view of
the problem from a broader, historical-comparative perspective. Many Jê languages
display a contrast for obstruents not only in the nasal-oral dimension, but also in the
voice-voiceless dimension. These dimensions may have – probably did – interact,
historically, resulting in the obstruent inventories found in the languages nowadays.
Exceptions such as the ones noted in Apinajé probably constitute important clues for this
historical development.
As mentioned before, Ham (1961) considers prenasalized segments as allophones
of nasal phonemes. In her analysis, /m, n, / display the allophones [mb, nd, d] before
oral vowels, since she does not take into consideration the few existing minimal pairs.
As a final result, she concludes that there are just two series of phonemes: oral stops and
nasal consonants.","[61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]"

NEGThe negation of descriptive verb predicates, illustrated in (80), presents some
variation as to which form of the negative should be used. Most consultants tended to
employ ket=ne for negation of descriptive predicates. However, at least one consultant
showed preference for the use of the simplex negative morpheme ket in these contexts.
As seen in the examples, the predicate of the clause type in (80.a) is unambiguously
verbal; whereas in (80.b, c) the existential semantics of the constructions (ambiguous, in
example (b)) might justify the preference for ket, since existential predicates categorize
morphosyntactically with nominal predicates in Apinajé (section IV.3.5), and nominal
predicates are negated with ket.","[265, 266]"
"Summary of properties of the phonological wordThree prosodic properties characterize the phonological word: stress, echo-vowels and
aspiration. Stress is predictable in Apinajé and indicates the end of a phonological word.
Any putative phonological word must consist of at least one stress-bearing element.
Aspiration is a process that applies only word-medially; it is also related to stress.
Finally, echo-vowels also serve as an index of final word boundary. A more detailed
discussion of the phonological word in Apinajé is provided in the next chapter, where this
notion is contrasted to that of grammatical word.",[94]

v.intr. nurse (on maternal breast). Nonfinite form: same; no inflection. Grammar: a.
This verb has a bivalent counterpart in  piao. b. Although this verb does not seem to
take inflection in either form, it does require the occurrence of the ergative marker
when in subordinate position. Compare with piagri, in that respect. Ex.: Na pa piao.
‘I’m nursing.’ Na pa piao ketne. ‘I’m not nursing.’ Prir kt piao cw ja na ickra ne.
‘This kid that’s nursing is my child.’ See o, kao; piagri.

v.prtcpl. broken into large pieces. Grammar: form related to the ambitransitive verb
kaek. Similar to the nonfinite form of aC- verbs, although atkaek is a nonexistent
verb in the language. The semantics and use of this form is adjectival, as in a
resultative participial. Ex. Kukrac‡ pika/ek õ c‡w´jn ja na ka prE i¯m´) agõ ‘The broken
bowl you gave to me.’
v.prtcpl. torn. Inflectional pattern: S=pikaco.. Grammar: related to the transitive verb
kaco ‘tear; rip’ and the intransitive atkaco ‘tear, rip’. The semantics and use of this
form is adjectival, as in a participial resultative. Ex.: Na i¯õ c‡ak rE pikac‡ojn kˆn´) ‘My

v.intr. fall apart.
v.prtcpl. broken into pieces. Inflectional pattern: S=pikuke. Grammar: Related to the
transitive verb kuke ‘break into pieces’. Grammar: This is essentially a nonfinite form
of the verb, even though it may occur in a regular finite position with no variation.
The semantics and use of it is adjectival, as in a participial resultative. Ex.: Pipç na ra

v.prtcpl. tied up. Inflectional pattern: S=pr; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form:
same. Grammar: a. This form has the semantics of a participial resultative form, and
follows a descriptive pattern of inflection. It is related to the verb katpr, which is a
transitive counterpart it. b. There are examples in which the form pr seems to occur
as a nonfinite counterpart of katpr. In such cases, pr takes person inflection for
object, and that contrasts with its use as a participial/resultative form. Ex.: Kt paj
akatpr. ‘I will tie you up.’ Im ickrkrac  tjc pa katpr. ‘Keep it steady against the
wall for me (so that) I tie it up.’ Na pa m katpr pa. ‘I tied them up.’ Na m ra pitt

n.dim. kinship term: used amongst sister to refer to one another.
v.dscr. tall. Inflectional pattern: S=prek; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same.
Phonology: The final consonant of this verb is realized as a compensatory lengthening
of the root vowel when it is followed by another consonant. If that consonant happens
to be the coronal stop /t/, another effect is that the coronal will be realized as voiced.
Ex.: B prekti muj na ibjen ja. ‘That tall man is my husband.’ Pa na pa t pai prek
kot icpa kete. ‘I don’t walk with tall people.’ Na b prek di. ‘The man is tall.’

v.intr.dscr. 1. be long; 2. adj. long.
v.tr. 1. leave; abandon. 2. allow. Inflectional pattern: O=r; no relational prefix.
Nonfinite form: same. Phonology: The initial consonant of the verb is realized as the
lateral alveolar approximant [l] in the context of a preceding coronal. Thus, /it-r/ is
produced [il]. Notice that there is no vowel length, which suggests the alternative
hypothesis that it is the coronal vowel itself which is conditioning the alternation. Ex.:
M pa jaja na pa m pr ne arik um m kwr jaja na m ir ne m ma apec. ‘As for
us, we were left behind and stayed, the others left us and went away.’ Kt ja ir. ‘S/he

adv.1. intensifier. 2. adj. large. 3. qtf. much. No inflection. Semantics: The use of rac,
as well as ru, seems to imply that the predicator being modified encodes a permanent
property. Both these intensifiers contrast with tjc in this respect, which is used with
predicators encoding transitional or temporary conditions/states. Phonology: This
morpheme is realized as [lac] if following a coronal sound — vowel or consonant.
Grammar: a. This morpheme is used to modify verbs and nouns. There is no evidence408ras ti

)that it follows the inflectional pattern of descriptives. b. It may, in turn, be modified as
well (e.g. by the morpheme kumrc). c. This intensifier is compatible with words
derived by -ji, in contrast with the intensifier ru, which is not. d. There is evidence
which indicates that, if used with a transitive verb, this morpheme may refer to the
quantity of the direct object, rather than serve as an intensifier of the verb. Ex.: Go rac
‘river (water=large)’. Na ra im bc rac kumrc. ‘(Things) are really good for me.’
Ickengrji rac ne. ‘I’m really easy to get tired.’ Na pa icpuduj rac ne. ‘I’m really

v.tr. 1. throw (a ball), as in a game. 2. throw multiple, scattered things, or two things
which do not form a pair. 3. help oneself to foods of various kinds. Inflectional
pattern: O=re; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: The use of this
verb with the sense of ‘serve food’ contrasts with the verb me, with the same sense, in
that the latter requires the quantifier kw to determine meõ, whereas the former occurs
without the quantifier. One could describe the distinction also in terms of mass versus
count objects. Ex.: Me ac‡w´j jaja apen kr´) ti re) ‘They are also going to play (with

‘This husband of yours who keeps on treating you like that, he doesn’t like you.’naIf the subordinate verb is transitive, the ergative argument of the relative clause
must be overtly marked as such (16.b-c). The ergative marker is a positional clitic and
has the alternative forms t and kt: the former is used with first and second person
arguments, and takes person prefixes; kt refers to third person arguments, and takes no
prefixes (see chapter VI for a diachronic hypothesis about the development of differences
in the form of the ergative clitics).",[222]
"66One instance of alternation between this allophone of /õ/ and higher counterparts
[, u] has been noted in the corpus. The alternation applies to one morpheme in
particular, the indefinite determiner õ. The alternative realizations of this morpheme
might be partially due to factors external to the phonological system, however. It appears
that the indefinite article um [u] has been borrowed from Portuguese and phonologically
adapted into Apinajé as /õ/. The high allomorphs could be a retention of the original
shape of the borrowed morpheme.","[79, 80]"

here for convenience, certain combinations of clitics may form phonological words. The
clitic sequence shown in the example constitutes a one-foot word. The plosive in the

go3.1.4. Adverbials
The set of adverbials includes morphologically simple and complex items, and
expressions carrying adverbial meaning or function. Adverbials constitute another one of
those almost closed classes which nevertheless seems somewhat open and expansive,
since adverbial meanings may come in phrases and other larger constituents. Some
members of this class are temporal adverbs, location adverbs, intensifiers and a temporal
negative adverbial, discussed here.
Adverbs are phonological/grammatical words that are characterized
morphologically by lack of inflection. Their distribution in the sentence depends on the
kind of adverbial function they perform. Temporal and location adverbs seem more151syntactically free than other adverbs. Intensifiers are positional clitics, as is the temporal
negative adverbial. Some of these are introduced next.","[163, 164, 165]"
"1.1. Geographical and environmental considerations
The Central Plateau is a vast area ranging from north to south of Brazil that includes the
Araguaia and Tocantins basins. The Brazilian Central Plateau encompasses the States of6Minas Gerais, Goiás, Tocantins, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, and parts of the
States of São Paulo, Paraná, Maranhão and Piauí (map 1). The biome characteristic of
these areas is the cerrado, a savanna landscape typical of Brazil.2
The cerrado is characterized by hot, semi-humid weather consisting of rainy
summers and dry winters; rainfall indices range from 32 to 64 inches a year. The soil is
ancient, deep, and naturally poor in chemical nutrients. Cerrado vegetation is
characterized by a herbaceous stratum that extends over continuous, mostly flat areas
with a variable quantity of trees and shrubs, and by forest formations at river banks; it
includes, in addition, patches of palm trees and wetlands. Both the herbaceous layer and
the ligneous vegetation are characterized by the ability to sprout or rapidly recover after
the dry season or forest fires, a morphology that may have been an adaptive development
of the vegetation to survive frequent natural fires caused by lightning and other natural
phenomena. The various possible combinations and densities of the basic elements found
in the cerrado vegetation result in a wealth of different ecosystems which house one of
the largest diversities in plant and animal species on the planet (Pivello 2004; Delitti and
Pivello 2004).3
The Apinajé, like most Jê, are a cerrado people. Traditional Apinajé territory is
the delta at the confluence of the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers, in the north, extending
2Because they differ in various respects from the savannas of Africa, the term “cerrado” has been adopted
in the literature to refer to these typically Brazilian ecosystems (e.g. Goodland 1971; Pivello 2004). Being
the second largest biome of Brazil, the cerrado originally extended over about eighty-five percent of the
Central Plateau, which represents about 1,5 to 2 million square kilometers or approximately twenty percent
of the Brazilian territory (Delitti and Pivello 2004; Fonseca and Por 2004).
3For that reason, the cerrado is one of the priority areas for the preservation of biodiversity on Earth
(Delitti and Pivello 2004).","[19, 20]"
"Word classesThe present section is about the content and function words of Apinajé: how they
categorize and how this categorization is expressed in structural terms, among other
things. The discussion is organized in terms of lexical categories and grammatical
categories. Lexical categories include nouns, verbs, postpositions and adverbials –
mostly open classes (section 3.1). Grammatical categories are pronouns and clitics that
encode various grammatical meanings – words that consitute closed classes (section 3.2).",[120]
