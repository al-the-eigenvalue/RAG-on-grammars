"2Polar QuestionsPolar questions are defined here as questions that seek the answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’. A
polar question has the form of an indicative clause marked by the phrase-final
particle su. Elicited and natural discourse examples do not show an intonation
pattern distinct from that of affirmative clauses.
In most examples the interrogative particle has mid tone:
(1) Taú tá lúmò su
T. go market Q
‘did Tau go to the market?’
(2) hí wé ndày só
ndày
su
2PL saw 3PL.O house 3PL.POSS Q
‘did you see them at their place?’
Based on natural discourse data, low tone on the interrogative particle places
emphasis on the proposition in question (the voiceless fricative /s/ is sometimes voiced in intervocalic position):© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020 | doi:10.1163/9789004410053_014Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3227interrogatives(3) ɓay Taobay nə

‘who is he?’ (similar to ‘who does he think he is?’)
The assertive marker si before the interrogative particle places emphasis on the
unexpectedness of the event. Here the interrogative marker has mid tone:

‘did Tau actually go to the market this morning?’ (I told him to)
(8) mum tá lúmò si

3M go market ASSERT Q
‘did he really go to the market?’ (I told him not to)
The marker si cannot be used in a content question, which seeks additional
information about the event. This is evidence for the assertive function of si, as
described in chapter 9, since the speaker cannot advise the hearer to believe in
a state or event that is not fully described:

2M go where today (ASSERT) Q
‘where did you go to today?’ (i.e. I know you went somewhere, but I don’t

Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3228chapter 13The assertive marker can, however, be used in a polar question that questions the truth value of a single element of the proposition:

‘Tau went to Garoua today’
Speaker 2:

‘he went where today?’ (the speaker wants the hearer to believe that the
subject did not go)
Cf. the neutral content question:
(12) mum tá ka
tám su
3M go where today Q
‘where did he go today?’
The polar question marker may co-occur with a marker of modality, e.g., the
permission marker ye. This is evidence that the interrogative mood does not
belong to the same domain as the deontic and epistemic modalities described
in chapter 9:

order or preposition.","[242, 243, 244]"

Abstract
This chapter describes the means used in Pévé to code polar (‘yes/no’) questions and
content questions. All interrogatives are characterized by the presence of the clausefinal particle su. The coding of grammatical roles in the interrogative clause is the same
as that in the affirmative clause, with the exception of certain verbless interrogatives
concerning the identity of the deictic subject. Content questions code the following
distinctions: human constituent; non-human, inanimate or abstract constituent; manner; place; reason; and means.",[380]
"6Outline of the Grammar6.1
Phonology
The phonology of Pévé resembles that of many other Chadic languages in having a rich consonant system. In Pévé, the system includes glottalized and labialized stops, palatalized and non-palatalized fricatives, lateral fricatives, glottal
stops, a number of continuants, and syllable-initial consonant clusters. Pévé
has the phonemic vowels /i, e, a, o, u, ə/, where ə represents a high-central
vowel. The nasalized vowels /ĩ, ẽ, ã, õ, and ũ/ also occur in surface forms. The
question of the phonemic vs. phonetic nature of nasalized vowels is discussed
in chapter 2.
Syllables in Pévé may have the form V, CV, VC, CVC, CCV, CCVC, CCCVC.
An interesting feature of Pévé is that the majority of lexical items in the data
are monosyllabic. Among the few polysyllabic lexical items in the data, most
are obviously derived through compounding or other morphological means
(see below), suggesting that the derivation of the polysyllabic forms is relatively
recent.
Pévé has three tones, high, mid, and low, which carry functions in the domains of both lexicon and grammar. In some cases a lexical distinction is coded
solely by tone. The primary function of tone in the grammatical system is the
coding of perfective aspect by means of relative high tone on the verb. In all
tenses and aspects other than the perfective, the verb has its underlying tone,
i.e., the tone that is used in the isolated or citation form. In the description
below, this form is referred to as the unmarked or non-perfective form of the
verb. As shown in chapters 8–10, temporal, aspectual and modal categories
other than the perfective are coded by preverbal markers and by the choice of
subject and non-subject pronouns. The use of non-subject pronouns to mark
functions that are typically associated with verbal markers is an unusual characteristic of the Pévé language.
6.2
Lexical Categories
Lexical categories in Pévé include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, at least one adposition, and onomatopoeic forms. As is the case in many
languages, some forms may function as either a noun or a verb, depending onErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3the pévé language13morphology and the syntactic structure of the utterance, e.g. tsoɓ ‘purchase’
(verb or noun); ɣaw ‘fight’ (verb or noun); dzraʔ-dzràʔ ‘jump up and down’
(verb) or ‘an up-and-down road’ (noun). Prepositions play an important role in
the grammar, coding grammatical relations as well as spatial and temporal relations. Certain nouns, modifiers, and verbs appear to have their source in onomatopeic expressions, many of which involve reduplication, e.g. wuwú ‘wind
instrument’; trumtrum ‘dishonest’; kramkram ‘to swerve around’, and krim ‘to
fall with a crash’.
6.3
Structure of the Noun Phrase
Some modifiers precede the head noun and others follow the head noun.
Prenominal modifiers appear to be limited to nouns coding the gender, age,
importance, or relative size of the head noun (see chapter 5). Modifiers that
follow the head noun include other attributive adjectives, numerals, quantifiers, nouns in the possessive function, possessive pronouns, and determiners.
Most Pévé nouns do not inherently carry a singular vs. plural distinction.
Plurality can be marked by the use of an inherently plural verb or an inherently plural possessor or quantifier, or it may be deducible through context or
shared knowledge. Interestingly, this is also the case in Pero, a distantly related
Chadic language of the West branch spoken in northern Nigeria (Frajzyngier
1989). Plurality of the head noun in Pévé can also be marked by the suffix -(h)áy
at the end of the noun phrase.
The grammatical gender system is limited to singular second- and thirdperson pronouns, which code either feminine or masculine gender, and a small
set of nouns that code natural feminine or masculine gender, e.g. ma ‘woman,
wife’, ndʒí ‘man, husband’.
6.4
Grammatical Relations
The term ‘grammatical relations’ refers to the functional relationships between
the verb and the noun phrase(s) in the clause. Grammatical relations marked
in Pévé include subject, direct object and indirect object. Like a number of
Chadic languages of all branches, the Pévé pronoun system does not distinguish between the direct object and the indirect object (see chapter 6 and
elsewhere). The means of marking this distinction and other grammatical relations include linear order; the position of the noun phrase with respect to
another noun phrase; the adposition ne, derived from the verb ne ‘to give’; and
the associative preposition kə. Means of marking the relationship between a
pronoun and the verb include the form of the pronoun, which may be confined to a specific grammatical relation, and the position of a pronoun withErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-314chapter 1respect to another pronoun or noun phrase. There is no coding of grammatical
relations on the verb itself or on the noun stem, and pronouns do not serve as
prefixes, infixes, or suffixes. A third-person singular inanimate object that has
been previously mentioned is usually not overtly marked in the clause, since
the role of the entity can be deduced from the nature of the verb and the roles
of other participants in the clause. If a third-person pronoun is used to refer to
a previously mentioned inanimate entity, this places the object in contrastive
focus.
A very important and unusual characteristic of Pévé is that the coding of
grammatical relations is inseparable from the coding of tense, aspect, and
mood. Different linear orders and different pronominal forms are used in different tenses, aspects, and moods (see below), and in some cases the choice
of pronoun form and/or the linear order of constituents is the only means of
coding tense, aspect, or mood (see chapters 8 and 9).
6.5
Semantic Relations
In Pévé, the semantic role of the subject in a construction may be controlling or non-controlling, affected or unaffected. Whether or not the subject is
affected is a function of inherent properties of the verb and inherent properties of the subject argument. The semantic role of a direct object may be that
of the affected object or the object of perception. Semantic roles of the indirect object include recipient, beneficiary, malefactive, addressee, and others,
again according to inherent properties of the verb and other arguments in the
construction.
Other semantic functions marked in Pévé include include source, reciprocal, and reflexive. The function of a participant as the source of an event is
marked by the dedicated preposition ɓá ‘from’, derived from the noun ‘hand’.
The noun tú ‘body’ in object position indicates that the subject and the object
have the same referent. The reciprocal marker ndʒì at the end of a clause
indicates that referents denoted by a plural subject noun or pronoun acted
simultaneously upon one another. An interesting feature of Pévé is that when
the reciprocal marker ndʒì is preceded by the associative preposition kə̀, the
clause indicates that the subject referents did not act on one another but
instead acted together in an event that may or may not have affected another
entity.
6.6
Tense and Aspect
As mentioned above, a key feature of Pévé is that the coding of tense and
aspect interacts with the coding of grammatical relations. Grammatical relations in perfective clauses on the one hand, and in all other tenses and aspectsErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3the pévé language15(‘non-perfective’) on the other hand, are coded by different pronoun forms and
different linear orders of various constituents. Although the language has markers whose function is to mark tense or aspect, these markers are often omitted,
leaving the order of constituents and/or the choice of pronouns as the only
means of coding tense or aspect.
Pévé codes only one tense, the future tense, which is marked by the preverbal marker də̀ (derived from the verb də̀ ‘go, travel’) followed by the verb
with its underlying tone. The marker də̀ occurs after the subject noun or pronoun and before the verb. A distinguishing feature of Pévé is that a clause
that is not marked for future tense is not marked specifically for any other
tense, resulting in the sole temporal contrast between future and non-future.
Unlike in many Chadic languages, a marker of tense may occur with a marker
of aspect in the same clause. The only examples of the co-occurrence of tense
and aspect involve the future tense and the imperfective aspect (see chapter 8).
With respect to aspect, the system can be divided into the perfective aspect,
marked by high tone on the verb stem, and all other aspects (non-perfective),
marked by underlying tone (high, mid or low) on the verb stem. Some, but not
all, non-perfective aspects are marked by preverbal markers. Non-perfective
aspects include the imperfective aspect, marked by the preverbal marker wə́;
progressive aspect, marked by the preverbal marker ké; and the unmarked
tense/aspect, coded by use of the unmarked (non-perfective) verb stem without any markers of tense or aspect. The interpretation of the unmarked aspect
is determined by setting and context, temporal adverbials used in the clause,
and the mutual understanding or shared knowledge of the speaker and hearer.
The perfective/non-perfective aspectual distinction does not pertain only to
preverbal markers and tone on the main verb. Pévé has two sets of direct/indirect object pronouns, one used in the perfective aspect and the other used
in all other aspects (non-perfective). The existence of two distinct pronoun
systems allows for the coding of the perfective/non-perfective distinction without any other means, such as tonal changes or dedicated aspectual markers.
Because subject pronouns do not distinguish between perfective aspect and
non-perfective aspect, the coding of aspect via the choice of pronoun can occur
only in a clause that contains at least one non-subject argument.
6.7
Modality
The domain of modality in Pévé can be divided into two major categories: subjunctive and indicative. An unusual feature of Pévé is the existence of a set of
subject pronouns used exclusively in subjunctive clauses: In many cases, the
form of the subject pronoun is the only means of marking a clause as subjunc-Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-316chapter 1tive. Other coding means within the subjunctive mood include the absence of
an overt subject and/or the form of direct/indirect object pronoun(s) used in
the clause. Interestingly, direct/indirect object pronouns used in the subjunctive mood are identical with those in the perfective set, as described above. This
set of object pronouns can thus be termed the perfective/subjunctive set, in
contrast with the non-perfective/non-subjunctive set. The verb in the subjunctive clause carries its underlying tone and cannot be preceded by a tense/aspect
marker.
The subjunctive mood is subdivided into several modalities, including obligation, permission, and prohibition, each marked by one of a set of clause-final
or clause-initial particles. Unlike many languages, Pévé does not make a formal
distinction between the imperative mood, i.e. a command addressed to the second person, and the subjunctive mood, which may express desire, possibility,
obligation, and other irrealis functions. While in some languages the absence
of a subject pronoun is a marker of the imperative mood, in Pévé the subject
pronoun can be used in or omitted from both imperative clauses and clauses
marked for other subdomains within the subjunctive mood.
Modalities within the indicative mood include the speaker’s promise or
prediction, marked by the clause-final marker ɓo, and the assertive modality,
which conveys the speaker’s belief that an event or a state did occur, is occurring, could occur, or will occur. The assertive modality is marked by the morpheme si, which can occur in clause- or sentence-final position or immediately
before the clause-final interrogative marker su in a polar question. The marker
si cannot be used in a negative clause.
Pévé has also grammaticalized the counterfactual modality, marked by the
postverbal marker kə̀zə́, as a means of indicating that the subject’s belief or
wish concerning the event was unrealized or cannot be realized. Caron 2015
describes a similar function in two West Chadic languages, namely Hausa,
where the counterfactual is marked by the clause-initial conjunction dà, and
Zaar, where the counterfactual is marked by the conjunction jâːn or the conjunction dà:, borrowed from Hausa.
6.8
System of Reference
Pévé has a system of reference that includes the following subdomains: known
or deducible reference; anaphoric reference, also known as previous mention;
and deictic reference, i.e. reference to an entity, location or time with respect
to another entity or the time or place of speech. Coding means include bare
(unmodified) nouns; choice of pronouns; the absence of overt marking of a
participant; and three sets of determiners. Singular determiners and demonstratives code gender distinctions (female vs. male) and the nature of the refer-Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3the pévé language17ent (known vs. deducible, proximal vs. distal). Some determiners also function
as demonstratives referring to participants in an event. Interestingly, Pévé has
only one plural demonstrative/determiner, kunə, which codes plurality of an
entity of any number or gender. Like most Chadic languages, Pévé has no designated first-mention marker that corresponds to the indefinite article found
in many Indo-European languages.
A deducible referent is a referent that can be identified by the listener even
if the referent is not visible and has not been previously mentioned A thirdperson singular inanimate object that has been previously mentioned is usually
not overtly marked, as its role is deducible from other elements in the clause.
Pévé also marks a distinction between deducible nouns and non-deducible
nouns: A noun whose referent can be deduced through previous mention or
common knowledge of hearer and speaker is marked by the determiner rə
(fem.), nə (masc.) or kunə (PL), glossed as DED for ‘deducible reference’ (Shay
2015). A proper noun is not overtly marked as a deducible referent, since it is
inherently deducible.
As stated above, the forms of various pronouns vary with the tense, aspect,
and mood properties of the clause. All pronouns distinguish between masculine and feminine gender in the second- and third-person singular forms. There
is no distinction between direct and indirect object pronouns.
6.9
Locative Predication
In a language that has grammaticalized the function of locative predication,
certain predicates and complements are inherently locative. ‘Locative’ is defined here as indicating location or motion involving a participant or an event
(cf. Heine, Claudi, and Hünnemeyer 1991, along with many other works). The
evidence that a given language has grammaticalized the function of locative
predication is that a predicate or complement that is not inherently locative
must be overtly marked as such when it occurs in a predication involving movement or location.
Inherently locative nouns in Pévé include toponyms and certain common
nouns, including lúmò ‘market’ and só ‘village, house’. Inherently locative predicates include verbs corresponding to ‘go’, ‘come’, ‘sit’, ‘lie down’, ‘depart’ and
others. In a clause that describes movement or location of a participant or an
event but whose complement is not inherently locative, the complement must
be marked by a locative preposition indicating the nature of the movement or
the location. The same is true if the predicate itself is not inherently locative,
even if the complement itself is locative. In a clause in which both the predicate
and the complement are inherently locative, the complement must be marked
by a locative preposition if the complement does not immediately follow theErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-318chapter 1predicate. A locative predication thus may have one of the following forms. The
term ‘Other’ represents a noun, modifier or other constituent that may occur
between the predicate and the complement:
Locative predicate + Locative complement
Locative predicate + PREP + Non-locative complement
Non-locative predicate + PREP + Locative complement
Locative predicate + Other + PREP + Locative complement
Locative predication as a distinct grammatical function has been demonstrated
for Chadic languages of all branches (Frajzyngier 2018).
6.10
Verbless and Copular Clauses
Like many Chadic languages, Pévé has a wide range of verbless clauses whose
functions include attributive predication, locative predication, possessive
predication, and equational predication. The means of marking the function
of a verbless clause include the inherent meaning of the lexical constituents,
the relative marker mə, determiners, the impersonal pronoun na and other
clause-final markers, and locative prepositions. Pévé differs from most Chadic
languages in having a designated copula corresponding to ‘to be’. An interesting
fact is that the copula, kè, is used only in equational, attributive, and locative
clauses referring to past or future time; it is not used in clauses referring to the
time of speech. The copula may co-occur with the future-tense marker də̀ or
with a direct/indirect object pronoun from the perfective set. A verbless clause
with the equational, attributive, locative, or possessive function and without
the copula kè codes reference to the time of speech.
6.11
Interrogatives
All interrogatives in Pévé, whether polar (‘yes/no’) questions or content questions, are marked by the phrase-final particle su. Grammatical roles are marked
in the interrogative clause as they are in the affirmative clause. Tense, aspect
and mood are also marked as they are in the affirmative clause. Content questions distinguish between the human constituent, represented by sa ‘who’, and
the non-human, inanimate or abstract constituent, represented by mi ‘what’.
Content questions also distinguish among questions concerning manner (ma
‘how’) and location (ka ‘where’). Questions concerning the time of an event or
the cause of an event are marked by the prepositional phrases zə̀ mi ‘why’ (lit.
‘for what’) and kə ma ‘when’ (lit. ‘with how’).","[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3interrogatives2293.1
Questions about Human Participants
A question about the identity of a human participant in an event involves the
question word sa ‘who’, whose grammatical role is coded as it is in the affirmative clause. The interrogative marker su occurs at the end of the clause:
(14) sa dám mbraw ne nùm su
who sew clothes ADP 3M.O Q
‘who sewed clothes for him?’
Cf.
(15) ta dám mbraw ne nùm su
3F sew clothes ADP 3M.O Q
‘she sewed clothes for him?’
The role of the question word as possessor is coded by the position after the
possessum, as it is in the affirmative clause:
(16) hu sa víʔ su
goat who lost Q
‘whose goat is lost?’
(17) mum wə́
bàr só

3M IMPF live house who Q
‘who does he live with?’ (‘he lives in whose house?’)
Cf. the affirmative:
(18) mum wə́
suk só
màn
3M IMPF stay house 1SG.POSS
‘he lives at my house’
A verbless clause with sa as predicate poses a question about the identity of
the human subject. The person, gender, and number of the referent are coded
by the pronominal subject:
(19) ta sa su
3F who Q
‘who is she?’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3230chapter 13(20) mum sa su
3M who Q
‘who is he?’
In a question about the identity of a previously mentioned referent, the deducible reference marker nə (see chapter 12, section 3) follows the question
word:
(21) ɓay sàanəsu
ɓay sa
nə

‘who was it who cooked for him?’
3.2
Questions about Non-human Constituents
The question word mi ‘what’ is used in questions about non-human or inanimate participants and in questions about abstract constituents. The grammatical function of the question word is marked by linear order or by preposition.
The subject role is marked by clause-initial position:
(23) mí gí su
what go Q
‘what happened?’
The object role is marked by the position after the verb:
(24) mum ti mí su
3M eat what Q
‘what did he eat?’
(25) ha wàʔ mì su
2M want what Q
‘what do you want?’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3interrogatives231A question about the identity of a non-human deictic subject is a verbless clause. The subject is represented by the question word mi ‘what’ and the
predicate is a deictic demonstrative coding the person, gender, and number of
the referent (see chapter 12). The relative marker may precede the demonstrative:
(26) mi (mə) ni
su
what REL PROX.M Q
‘what is this?’
(27) mi (mə) náyʔ
su
what (REL) DIST.M Q
‘what is that?’
3.3
Questions about Reason
There are several ways of posing a question about the cause of or reason for an
event, all of which involve a preposition and the non-human question word mi
‘what’.
The preposition zə̀ ‘for’ followed by mi ‘what’ indicates a question about
reason. The prepositional phrase, like most adjuncts, may be clause-initial or
clause-final. When zə̀ mi is clause-final, the interrogative particle su follows the
prepositional phrase:
(28) mum mbə́ zə̀ mi su
3M come for what Q
‘why did he come?’
The prepositional phrase zə̀ mi is one of the few constituents that can precede
the subject of the sentence:
(29) zə̀
mi mum mbə́ su
PREP what 3M come Q
‘why did he come?’
(30) zə̀ mi mum tsú tʃé
mbì mə su
for what 3M NEG drink water NEG Q
‘why didn’t he drink the water?’
The preposition zə̀ also marks the affirmative reason clause (cf. chapter 21):Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3232chapter 13(31) handày pík né zə̀
zà ɗám kú
3PL
flee PREP grass build fire
‘they fled because of the grass fire’
At the normal rate of speech the preposition zə̀ may be omitted from the reason question, leaving only the question word mi ‘what’. The structure is thus
the same as a question about a non-human participant in the object role:
(32) ha tʃiʔ mí ndə́ na
su
2M cry what like I.PRO Q
‘Why are you crying like that?’
(33) ha gí mi tám su
2M do what today Q
‘what did you do today?’
A question about reason may be coded by the phrase zə̀ dàn (‘for word/matter’)
followed by the question word mi. The sequence zə̀ dàn mi poses a question
about the fundamental cause or root of an event:
(34) ha ʔí
nàn zə̀ dàn
mi su
2M insult 1SG.O reason (‘for word’) what Q
‘why did you insult me?’ (‘what caused you to insult me?’)
A question about reason can also be marked by kə́dàn (ASSC ‘word/matter’)
followed by the question word mi and the interrogative marker:
(35) mum mbə́ kə́dàn mí su
3M come PURP what Q
‘why did he come?’
The phrase kə́dàn also marks the affirmative clause describing the purpose of
an action (see chapter 21):
(36) na mbə́ kə́dàn wum ín kwá
1SG come PURP learn read (lit. ‘speak thing’)
‘I came here to learn to read’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3233interrogatives3.4
Questions about Manner
A question about manner is indicated by the question word ma after the verb,
followed by the interrogative marker su. The question word may be preceded
by the relative marker mə̀, the conditions for which remain to be explored:
(37) ha gi (mə) ma su
2M do (REL) how Q
‘how do you do it?’
(38) syem(ɗe) màŋ
ɗe ma su

‘what is your name?’ (female addressee; lit. ‘your name is called how?’)

(40) ha gi sin wũ
(mə) ma tam su
2M do work 2M.POSS REL how today Q
‘how did you work today?’ or ‘how did you do your work today?’
The question word ma and the question word mi ‘what’ are interchangeable in
some constructions:

2M buy how/what Q
‘how/what are you buying?’
(42) ha tì ma/mi
su
2M eat how/what Q
‘how/what are you eating?’

Questions about Time
A question about the time of an event may be marked by the question word ma
‘how’ preceded by the associative preposition kə:

Questions about Quantity

the noun whose quantity is in question. As usual, the interrogative marker su
is clause-final:
(45) ha tsóɓ ndaʔ ma dák
su
2M buy horse how many (‘what amount’) Q
‘how many horses did you buy?’
3.7
Questions about Location
In a question about the location of an event or an entity, the question word ka
‘where’ follows the verb and precedes the interrogative marker:
(46) Taú suk
ka
su
T. stay, live where Q
‘where does Tau live?’
(47) ha tá ka
tám su
2M go where today Q
‘where did you go today?’
Cf. the affirmative, where the locative complement also follows the verb:
(48) ha tá lúmò
2M go market
‘you went to the market’
A question about the location of the subject is a verbless clause with ka as the
predicate, followed by su:
(49) mum ka
su
3M where Q
‘where is he?’
The locative question word may be preceded by the locative complement gaʔ
‘side’, apparently without changing the meaning:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3interrogatives235(50) ɓay Taobay nə

‘“So where is this Taobay?”’4ConclusionAll types of interrogatives in Pévé are marked by the clause-final marker su. The
polar question has the form of an affirmative clause followed by su, with grammatical roles and other categories marked as they are in the affirmative clause.
Content questions are marked by a set of question words that distinguish
among human referents on the one hand (sa ‘who’) and non-human, inanimate, or abstract constituents (mi ‘what’) on the other; manner (ma ‘how’); and
location (ka ‘where’). Further distinctions, including time, reason, and quantity, are coded by prepositional phrases involving the content question words
above. The marker si occurs in a content question only when the question
expresses the speaker’s disbelief in some element of the clause. Grammatical
relations within content questions word are marked as they are in the affirmative clause.","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251]"
"3ConclusionPévé is an active language whose speakers are well aware of the need to preserve their language, cultural activities, and intercultural relations in a world
in which political, social, and economic affairs can lead to the loss of language
and traditions. The goal of the present work is to document and preserve some
of the interesting and important characteristics of Pévé for the benefit of generations to come. With respect to nomenclature, the present work adopts the
educated native-speaker Wambadang’s view that Pévé is a language distinct
from Zimé; that the term Lamé also refers to Pévé; that dialects of Pévé include
Dari, Doué, and perhaps others; that (Vun) Dzəbao, Gumaji and Herdé may
be either remote dialects of Pévé or pidgin languages that are influenced by
both Pévé and Mesme (Chadic, East Branch); and that the term Kaʔɗó (and
its variants) is not acceptable as a name for the Pévé language or culture. The
present work does not attempt to answer further questions about classification
but focuses instead on lexical and grammatical forms in Pévé and the functions
they encode.
While Pévé shares many forms and functions with other languages of the
Chadic family, particularly those of the Masa branch, the Pévé language also has
a number of unique or unusual features. One such feature is that the choice of
pronoun(s) in a given clause is often the only means of indicating the temporal,
aspectual, and/or modal properties of the clause. In other words, the language
has a number of distinct sets of pronouns whose function is not only to indicate the gender, number and syntactic role of a participant but also the tense,
aspect or mood of the clause. Despite the large system of pronouns, the grammatical gender system is limited to singular second- and third-person pronouns
and a small set of nouns that are inherently feminine or masculine. Another
interesting feature of Pévé is that the scope of the negative clause is that of theErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3the pévé language23entire proposition rather than a participant in the proposition. Another feature is that while Pévé has a rich system of reference that distinguishes among
anaphoric, deictic, and deducible referents, nouns in Pévé are rarely marked for
number (singular or plural). The language also has a rich system of modality
that includes the unusual counterfactual mood, whereby a dedicated marker
indicates that the event described in the proposition did not occur.","[38, 39]"

1IntroductionThe Pévé-English lexicon in this chapter is organized according to the International
Phonetic Alphabet, with some additions and exceptions. In general, the order of vowels as entered in the lexicon is i, e, ə, a, o, and u; the consonant or fricative (e.g. ndz,
ʃ ) precedes the palatalized form (ndʒ, ʃy); and the non-glottalized form (b, d) precedes
the glottalized form (ɓ, ɗ ). Because some existing written works on Pévé do not use IPA
symbols, the symbols used in those works are shown in brackets after the corresponding IPA symbols, such as ɓ [b’], dʒ [j, dž]. Abbreviations are used in the lexicon as they
are in the text.
As shown in chapter 2 (Phonology), there are a number of free variations in pronunciation, especially in morphemes that begin with a stop or fricative followed by a
high or mid front vowel. In the Pévé-English lexicon, the Pévé form in the left-hand column represents the native speaker’s perception of the underlying form, e.g. ʃinè ‘field’,
while the form in the right-hand column of the English-Pévé lexicon (chapter 24) may
include the underlying form and free variations as transcribed by the author, e.g. ʃinè
or sine.
Needless to say, the two lexicons do not represent a complete list of lexical items and
morphemes in the Pévé language; there are many more to be examined and described.
The items listed below represent those attested in the data and others whose forms
and/or translations may be of interest to the reader.","[346, 347, 348]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3170chapter 93.2.1
Distribution of the Marker si
The marker si, analyzed here as the marker of assertive mood, can occur in
several positions: clause- or sentence-final position; the position immediately
before the clause-final interrogative marker su; or the position immediately
before a sentence-final adjunct. The implications of these possibilities are
described later in the chapter. Here are examples involving the marker si:
Clause-final:
(55) ndʒɪn màn
ɮɛ́ si
ndʒin màn
ɮé si
story 1SG.POSS start ASSERT
‘My story starts right now.’
Before the interrogative marker:
(56) ha wé
si
su
2M know ASSERT Q
‘did you know (that)?’/‘did you see (that)?’
The assertive marker can also be used in a question that is marked for future
tense. This provides evidence that the assertive marker does not code a function in the domain of tense (see chapter 8):
(57) nambà də̀ ndewa
ʃíw
si
su
1PL
FUT meet (lit. ‘fall head’) tomorrow ASSERT Q
‘will we see each other tomorrow?’
The marker si also occurs at the end of all recorded conditional protasis clauses:
(58) laʔ
hi wə́
də̀ lumo si
i
dʒi wa
COND 2PL IMPF go market ASSERT 2PL.SBJV wait head
rìn-i
1SG.POSS-F
‘if you go to the market, wait for me’
The assertive marker si can also occur at the end of the apodosis clause, i.e., at
the end of the complex sentence:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3171mood and modality(59) laʔ
mum wə́
sə pum si
tə
ʔya si
COND 3M IMPF 3F.O hit ASSERT 3F.SBJV leave ASSERT
‘if he is hitting her, she should leave’
The marker si follows some, but not all, temporal protasis clauses (see also
chapter 18):
(60) kəri məni handày gí sin ndày
ndóʔ wə
ʃìnè si
when
3PL
do work 3PL.POSS finish PREP field ASSERT
handày géwa tá só
ndày-a
3PL
return DIR house 3PL.POSS
‘when they finished their work in the field, they went back home’
Cf. the temporal protasis without si:
(61) kəri məni ta gé ndoʔ sin sə́
ta pemãy(-a)
when
3F finish work 3F.POSS 3F rest(-FV)
‘when she finished her work, she rested’
The evidence that si does not mark the boundary between the protasis and the
apodosis is that si in the protasis clause can be followed by an adverbial adjunct
that modifies the preceding clause:
(62) kəri məni mum làʔ
ʔwáy gàyʔ sì
dáŋʔ mum par
vay
when
3M COND win game ASSERT all 3M remove child
gayʔ ɗáw-a
game one
‘Each time he won the game, he took out a playing piece (vay gayʔ).’
(63) mum ti ɬew um
si
tʃẽt-ẽ
3M eat meat 3M.POSS ASSERT all-FV
‘he ate all his meat’
Moreover, in the temporal construction the protasis clause (bolded in the following example) does not have to end in si:
(64) dayna dùkri mə̀ tám (pause) handày də̀ tsòɓ ndá màn
after night REL today
3PL
FUT buy horse 1SG.POSS
nə
si
3M.DED ASSERT
‘after tonight, they will buy my (male) horse’
Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3172chapter 93.2.2
Function of the Marker si
The marker si indicates that the speaker wants the hearer to believe in the
truth or actuality of the event or state described by the clause that precedes
the marker si. The temporal status of the event or state may be the past, the
time of speech, or the future. The evidence for the assertive function is provided by examining the circumstances in which si does and does not occur and
contrasting the function of si with the functions of other morphemes and constructions.
The evidence that si codes a function in the domain of affirmative modality
is that the marker cannot co-occur with the negative marker:
(65) motaʔ
ɗáw tsugàk
tsùwal mi *si
mòtaʔ (borr.) ɗáw tsú
gàk tsùwal mi *si
car (Ful.)
one NEG can cross NEG ASSERT
‘Not one car could cross it.’
The marker si also cannot be used in a content question that seeks additional
information about the event:
(66) Taú tá ka
tám kə
bə̀kà
(*si)
su
T. go where today ASSC morning ASSERT Q
for ‘where did Tau go this morning?’
However, the marker si can be used in a polar question marked by the clausefinal interrogative su. The result is a polar question seeking confirmation of the
speaker’s assertion/belief that an event took place or will take place:
(67) Taú tá lúmò tám kə
bə̀kà
si
su
T. go market today ASSC morning ASSERT Q
‘did Tau (really) go to the market this morning?’
The marker si cannot follow an incomplete clause:
(68) ma
tʃí vun rùm-u
*si
ha mbə́ wàʔ mi su
woman ask 3M.POSS ASSERT 2M come want what Q
for ‘the woman asked him, “Why did you come here?” ’
The evidence that the clause is incomplete is that it cannot stand alone:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3mood and modality173(69) ma
tʃí vun rùm-u
*si
woman ask 3M.POSS ASSERT
for ‘the woman asked him’
Although si is often used in describing an event that took place in the past, it
is not a marker of tense or aspect. There are several pieces of evidence for this.
First, si can follow a clause marked for the future tense:
(70) hí də̀ ndewa síw
si
su
2PL FUT meet tomorrow ASSERT Q
‘will you (PL) see each other tomorrow?’
(71) dayna dùkri mə̀ tám (pause) ta də̀ ge
ndoʔ sin sə́
after night REL today
3F FUT throw finish work 3F.POSS
si
ASSERT
‘after tonight, she will finish her work’
Second, si can follow a clause in the perfective aspect, marked by high tone on
the verb, or a clause in the progressive aspect, marked by the aspect marker ké.
If the marker si had a function in the domain of aspect, it would not co-occur
with other aspect markers:
Perfective with si:
(72) ndʒin man
ndózu
si
ndʒin man
ndóʔ zù
sì
story 1SG.POSS finish bottom ASSERT
‘My story has ended.’
Progressive aspect with si:
(73) Gwà ke
suk wə
Mayo-Lope si
G. PROG stay PREP M.-L.
ASSERT
‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope’
Evidence that si does not code the completed or bounded nature of the event
is that the marker si can follow a clause describing an ongoing state:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3174chapter 9(74) Gwà toŋ pã
May si
G. large exceed M. ASSERT
‘Gwa is bigger than May’
(75) tsoɓ rum
(wə̀) ke ɓáyrúm si
price 3M.POSS IMPF COP much ASSERT
‘its price may be high’
As previously noted, a conditional clause referring to a potential future event
must be marked by si. The conditional protasis clause describes an event or
state that may or may not occur in the future, which might seem contradictory
to the notion of the assertive modality. In fact, this explains the obligatory use of
si in the conditional protasis clause: The assertive marker advises the hearer to
believe in the content of the protasis clause, without which the apodosis would
have no validity (see chapter 18 for a description of conditional constructions):
(76) laʔ
tsoɓ rum
ɓáyrúm si,
i
tsoɓ gaʔ ri
məsin
COND buy 3M.POSS much ASSERT 2PL buy side place other
ye
PERM
‘if its price is high, you can buy it somewhere else’
(77) ha laʔ

ama
M. believe COMP 3F be able drive car CF ASSERT but (Ar.)
ta gak
mi
3F be able NEG
‘May thought she could drive a car, but she couldn’t’
Perhaps the strongest evidence for the function of the marker si is the following example, where si occurs at the end of a clause describing a potential event
that did not actually occur. The presence of si advises the hearer to believe that
the event could have occurred. The marker kə̀zə́, glossed CF for ‘counterfactual’,
indicates the speaker’s knowledge that the event did not actually occur. The
scope of the assertive mood is thus the speaker’s wish for the hearer’s belief,
not the speaker’s own belief or knowledge with respect to whether the event
or state actually took place in the real world:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3175mood and modality(79) na gàk ùm zàʔ kə̀zə́ si

1IntroductionThe present volume is the first full description of the grammar of Pévé, a Chadic
language spoken in parts of the southwestern area of the Republic of Chad
and the Northern province of the Republic of Cameroon. Data for this volume
were gathered in the course of fieldwork in Cameroon during the summer of
2012 and supplemented by additional data gathered from native speakers. The
present volume also draws on the works of Rodney Venberg, Herrmann Jungraithmayr and Michka Sachnine for additional and comparative data (section
3, below).","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"

I am extremely grateful to Lazare Wambadang, a native speaker of Pévé who
is also fluent in French and English and without whom the present project
could not have been accomplished. Wambadang has selflessly devoted a great
amount of time and energy to describing and analyzing Pévé and creating
the present volume, and his enthusiasm has been an important part of the
project. I am also grateful to the American Council of Learned Societies, which
provided significant financial support for the project. I sincerely thank Henry
Tourneux, who provided essential logistical and personal support before and
during the fieldwork; Venasius Lendzemo and Noë Woin of the Institute de
Récherche Agricole pour le Développement (IRAD) in Cameroon, who also
provided logistical support for the fieldwork; Rodney Venberg, who has very
generously shared his own work on Pévé and provided many helpful comments
regarding the present work; the kind and supportive staff at Le Relais de la
Porte Mayo in Maroua; and Zygmunt Frajzyngier, whose assistance was crucial
before, during, and after the fieldwork and who provided much thoughtful and
detailed advice concerning the present work. Praat software (http://www.fon
.hum.uva.nl/praat/) was extremely useful for analyzing tone in the texts that
are the basis of the grammatical analysis. I also thank the publisher’s reviewer
for useful questions and suggestions concerning the document, all of which
have been taken into account in the final version.
I greatly admire the Pévé people for striving to maintain their language and
culture through peaceful measures despite social, political and changes of a
kind that have led to the loss of languages over centuries and across the world.
I sincerely hope that the present volume will be of use to native and non-native
speakers of Pévé and to speakers of languages that are related to, or have been in
contact with, the Pévé language. Because collaborator Wambadang is a native
speaker of Pévé, any errors in the transcription, translation or analysis of Pévé
are mine.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"2Future Tense2.1
Form of the Future Tense
The future tense is marked by the form də̀, probably derived from the verb də̀
‘to go’, followed by the main verb. The main verb carries its underlying tone,
i.e., the tone that occurs in the citation form, in the unmarked verb form, and
in all tenses and aspects other than the perfective (see sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4,
below):
(1) Taú də̀ tà lúmò
T. FUT walk market
‘Tau will walk to the market’
(2) ɓà
ha də̀ we
sakə sà
sù
ɓay ha də̀ we sa kə
sa su
CONJ 2M FUT know who ASSC who Q
‘So how will you know who is who?’
Evidence that the future marker də̀ in such constructions is a grammatical
marker and not the phonetically similar verb ‘to go’ is provided by the fact that
the future construction does not necessarily involve movement (see preceding
example). Moreover, the future marker may co-occur with the main verb də ‘to
go’, evidence that the two forms have different functions:
(3) Taú də̀ də lúmò
T. FUT go market
‘Tau will go to the market’
As shown in chapter 6, an object pronoun from the non-perfective set can intervene between the future marker and the main verb. This is evidence that the
future marker, like other tense/aspect markers, is a constituent that is separate
from the main verb:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3140chapter 8(4) ta də̀ nùm pum-u
3F FUT 3M.O hit-FV
‘she will hit him’
The negative marker tsú may also occur between the subject marker and the
future tense marker:
(5) na tsú də̀ gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn
ùm ne mì
1SG NEG FUT sell
cow 1SG.POSS 3M.O ADP NEG
‘I will not sell him my cow’
2.2
Function of the Future Tense
Evidence that the future marker də̀ codes the future tense is that it can be used
with an adverbial referring to a specific time in the future:
(6) ta də̀ gewa Garoua síw
3M FUT return G.
tomorrow
‘she will return from Garoua tomorrow’
(7) dayna dùkrí mə̀ tám (pause) namba də̀ ke wə
Garoua
after night REL today
1PL
FUT COP PREP G.
‘After tonight, we will be in Garoua.’
The marker də̀ cannot be used in a clause that refers to the past or the time of
speech:
(8) na *də̀ tsóɓ vú kúm-ú
1SG FUT buy salt yesterday-FV
*for ‘I bought salt yesterday’
(9) á *də̀ tà rəʔ /riʔ/ go [gwa]
1SG FUT walk already now
*for ‘I can come on in now’
Both clauses are grammatical without the future tense marker:
(10) na tsóɓ vú kúm-ú
1SG buy salt yesterday-FV
‘I bought salt yesterday’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3tense and aspect141(11) á tà rəʔ /riʔ/ go [gwa]
1SG walk already now
‘I can come on in now’
Evidence that the future marker də̀ codes tense rather than aspect is that it can
be used in reference to a future bounded event, a future ongoing event, or a
future state, all of which are functions in the domain of aspect:
(12) kəri məni kwáti làʔ
gí ndóʔ si,
nambà də̀ ti
when
food COND finish ASSERT 1PL
FUT eat
‘when/if the food is ready, we will eat’
(13) nambà də̀ ba(r)
dùkrí kerker

1PL
FUT sleep/pass night all the time ASSC do work-FV
‘we will spend the night working’ (some Pévé dialects use bar while others
use ba)
(14) ta də̀ kè bay màn-a
3F FUT be friend 1SG.POSS-FV
‘she will be my friend’
Further evidence that də̀ is a tense marker is that it can co-occur with a marker
of aspect, such as the imperfective marker wə́. The marking of both tense and
aspect in the same clause is unusual in Chadic languages. In the following
examples, the imperfective marker is not required, but its use is considered
grammatical:
(15) ta láʔá nambà (wə́) də̀ Pala
3F say 1PL
IMPF go P.
‘she said, “We will be going to Pala”’
(16) handày (wə) də tsoɓ bàfyek man ne
3PL
IMPF FUT buy corn 1SG.O ADP
‘they will be buying corn for me’3AspectThe following aspectual distinctions are marked within the verb phrase: Perfective aspect, coded by high tone on the verb; imperfective aspect, coded by theErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3142chapter 8preverbal marker wə́; progressive aspect, coded by the copula ké followed by the
main verb; and the unmarked aspect, coded by use of the verb with underlying
tone and no other markers.
An aspect marker, like the future marker, follows the subject noun or pronoun and precedes the verb. As illustrated in sections 3.2 and 3.3, other material
may intervene between the subject marker and the aspect marker or between
the aspect marker and the verb.
3.1
Perfective Aspect
3.1.1
Form
The perfective aspect is marked by relative high tone on the verb, regardless of
the underlying (also called ‘unmarked’) tone of the verb. The tone on the perfective verb is higher than the tone of the syllable that precedes the verb (for
more detailed discussion of the nature of tone, see chapter 2):
(17) na tí ɬew nãw kúm-ú
1SG eat meat bovine yesterday-FV
‘I ate beef yesterday’ (unmarked form ti ‘to eat’)
(18) mum tá lúmò kə
s-á
3M go market ASSC 3F.O-FV
‘he went to the market with her’ (unmarked form tà ‘to walk’)
When the verb has underlying high tone, there is no formal distinction between
the perfective aspect and the unmarked aspect:
(19) mum súk
kə
mbà zə̀
bə̀kà tʃep-e
3M stay, live, sit ASSC 1PL.O PREP day few-FV
‘he stayed with us for a few days’
Cf. the unmarked aspect:
(20) Taú súk
ka
su
T. stay, live, sit where Q
‘where does Tau live?’
If the verb is bisyllabic, only the first syllable carries high tone in the perfective:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3143tense and aspect(21) mum géwa Garoua ɓay mum ʔyá vari Maroua (si)
3M return G.
CONJ 3M leave road M.
ASSERT
‘he returned from Garoua and he departed for Maroua’
If the verb is a compound verb consisting of a verb followed by a noun, the
high tone coding the perfective is carried only by the verbal constituent of the
compound. The nominal constituent of the compound has its underlying tone:
(22) na ín dàn
ne nù
1SG say (‘speak word’) ADP 2M.O
‘I said something for you’ (unmarked forms are in ‘speak’ and dàn ‘word’)
Cf. the following, where dàn functions as the verb and so carries the high tone
that marks the perfective:
(23) na dán ne nù
1SG word ADP 2M.O
‘I told you so’ (lit. ‘I gave you word’)
In a serial verb construction of the form Verb+Verb, each verb carries high tone
in the perfective:
(24) kəri məni handày fáŋ tá
dáy Garoua
when
3PL
repeat go arrive G.
‘When they got back to Garoua …’
Evidence that relative high tone on the verb is a coding means is that a verb
whose underlying form has low or mid tone cannot carry high tone in a clause
involving a marker of another tense or aspect, such as the future tense marker
də̀ or the imperfective aspect marker wə́:
(25) mum də̀ gewa/*géwa Garoua síw
3M FUT return
G.
tomorrow
‘he will return from Garoua tomorrow’
(26) mum wə́
gewa/*géwa Garoua
3M IMPF return
G.
‘he is returning from Garoua’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3144chapter 83.1.2
Function
The perfective aspect, marked by high tone on the verb, is used to describe
a bounded event or state. The event or state may have been completed or
come to an end prior to the time of speech, or it may be expected to be completed or ended after the time of speech. The evidence that high tone on the
verb codes perfective aspect rather than the past tense is that the verb with
high tone can be used with reference to past, present, or future time (see
below).
The perfective aspect may be used with reference to a single event that was
completed before the time of speech:

tobacco 1SG.POSS day before yesterday-FV
‘He said, “One of you took my tobacco on credit (lit. ‘my tobacco’s credit’)
the day before yesterday.”’
The evidence that high tone on the verb marks the perfective aspect rather than
the past tense is that a verb marked for perfective aspect may refer to a bounded
event that will occur in the future. In this case, the verb is preceded by the conditional marker làʔ (see chapter 18) and followed by si, the marker of assertive
modality (see chapter 9):
(29) kwáti làʔ
gí ndóʔ sì
nambà də̀ ti
food COND do finish ASSERT 1PL
FUT eat
‘when/if the food is finished (i.e., ready), we will eat’ (gi ‘do’: citation/unmarked form)Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3145tense and aspect(30) tʃer laʔ

3PL
COND buy house ASSERT 3PL
FUT go stranger-FV
‘after we buy a house we will travel’
The perfective clause can refer to a non-singulative event or state, provided the
event or the state is bounded:
(32) na tá Mora syem
ráw si
1SG go M. time (‘foot’) many ASSERT
‘I have been to Mora many times’

CONJ rain fall

‘And it rained a lot.’
When the end of the event is the time of speech, the perfective can be used
with an adverbial referring to the time of speech:
(35) ta dáyri mgbaŋ ni na
3F arrive just now now I.PRO
‘she arrived just now’
The perfective aspect may be used with an adverbial coding the duration of the
event:

Imperfective Aspect
3.2.1
Form
The imperfective aspect is marked by the aspectual marker wə́ in the position
after the subject and before the verb. The verb carries its underlying tone:
(37) na wə́
dʒì (wa) Gwà
1SG IMPF wait PREP G.
‘I’m waiting for Gwa’
(38) mum wə́
tsoɓ ya nãw ɗáw-à

‘he is buying a cow/one cow’
(39) namba wə́

1PL
IMPF do reunion
‘we are doing a reunion’
Compare the perfective form, without wə́:
(40) namba ɓáwá si
1PL

‘we reunited’
Other material, such as the negative marker tsú, may intervene between the
subject and the imperfective aspect marker:
(41) Sə́ráy tsú wə́
gí
sìn ɓáy dày Táo mì
S.
NEG IMPF make work good arrive T NEG
‘Sə́ ráy works less hard than Tau’
The indirect object pronoun may intervene between the imperfective aspect
marker and the verb:
(42) mum wə́
mbà ne hu
3M IMPF 1PL.O give goat
‘he is giving us a goat’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3tense and aspect1473.2.2
Function
The imperfective aspect is used to describe an event that is ongoing at the time
of speech:
(43) ya
vay wə́
ne kwáti kə
vay
mother child IMPF give food ASSC child
‘the mother is feeding her child’
(44) səmbeɗ wə
səsaʔ-a
wind IMPF blow-FV
‘the wind is blowing’
The imperfective aspect is also used to describe a current state:
(45) vay wə́
tuk kəɗam-à
child IMPF feel good-FV
‘the child is satisfied’ (lit. ‘the child feels good’)
Evidence for the function of the imperfective marker is that it can co-occur
with an adverbial corresponding to ‘(right) now’:
(46) na wə́
taʔ kwá sə́ ne go/gwa
1SG IMPF show thing 3F.O ADP now
‘I am teaching her now’
The evidence that wə́ codes the imperfective aspect rather than the present
tense is that the imperfective aspect can be used to describe an event that was
ongoing at a time prior to the time of speech. Note the contrast between the
perfective aspect, used to describe the completed event of the first clause, and
the imperfective, used to describe the ongoing event of the second clause:
(47) mum mbə́ záʔ mbà ka
nambà wə́
gi ʃin-i
3M came find 1PL.O while 1PL
IMPF do work-FV
‘he found us while we were working’
Further evidence that wə́ does not code present tense is that it can be used with
an adverbial connoting a habitual event that may or may not be happening at
the time of speech:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3148chapter 8(48) mum wə́

‘he always buys it for me’
(49) fə̀tà lúmò tá wə́

‘on market day, she sells beer’
3.3
Progressive Aspect
The progressive aspect refers to an event or state that was ongoing before the
time of speech (cf. Payne 1997, Comrie 1976 and other sources) or an event or
state that is expected to occur after the time of speech. The forms and functions
of the progressive aspect are described below.
3.3.1
Form
The progressive aspect is marked by the perfective form of the copula ké (sometimes with the surface form kə́) followed by the main verb (cf. chapter 11 for use
of ké as the copular main verb). The verb following ké is unmarked and carries
its underlying tone:
(50) tá ké
gi tsoɓ mbìr kə
fə́tá
3F PROG sell

‘she used to sell milk during the dry season’
(51) Gwà ké

Mayo-Lope si
G. PROG stay, live PREP M.-L.
ASSERT
‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope (lit. ‘river-mud’ (Ful.); a village where Pévé
is spoken)’
Reference to an ongoing event that may occur after the time of speech is indicated by the imperfective marker wə́ before the future tense construction də +
Verb (see chapter 11):
(52) námbà wə́
də suk fəta tam kə
bãrĩ mba
1PL
IMPF FUT stay day today ASSC Bar today
‘We will be spending the day today with Bar.’
3.3.2
Function
Evidence that the marker ké does not mark the past tense is that ké can be used
in a clause with an adverbial referring to the time of speech. The function ofErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3149tense and aspectsuch a clause is to indicate that an ongoing state or event ended precisely at
the time of speech:
(53) ta ni ké
ge ndoʔ sin sə́
na
3F now PROG finish work 3F.POSS I.PRO
‘she is just now finishing her work’ (in answer to ‘what is she doing?’)
(54) ta ké
dayri mgbaŋ ni na
3F PROG arrive just now now I.PRO
‘she is just now arriving’ (in answer to ‘where is she right now?’)
The progressive aspect differs from the perfective aspect in that a clause marked for progressive aspect may refer to an uncompleted or ongoing event prior
to the time of speech:
(55) ta ké
ɗi
fún ɓay ta ké
gi tsoɓ rùm
lúmò
3F PROG make food CONJ 3F PROG sell
3M.POSS market
‘she was making food and she was selling it at the market’
Cf. the perfective aspect, which codes completion of the event before the time
of speech:
(56) ta ɗí
fún ɓay ta gí tsoɓ rum lúmò
3F make food CONJ 3F sell
3M.O market
‘she made food and sold it at the market’
The progressive aspect differs from the imperfective aspect in that the latter
describes an event that is ongoing at the time of speech:
(57) ta wə́
ɗi
fún ɓay ta wə́
də̀ gi tsoɓ rum
lúmò
3F IMPF make food CONJ 3F IMPF go sell
3M.POSS market
‘she is making food (right now) and selling it at the market’
In some cases the same event can be described using either the perfective
aspect or the progressive aspect, with a slight difference in meaning. In the
following examples, use of the perfective aspect indicates that the event, whatever its duration, is completed, while use of the progressive focuses on the
duration of the past event. This distinction is expressed in the English translations:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3150chapter 8Perfective:
(58) vay bá(r)
dùkrí kerker
kə
tʃiʔ-i
baby lie down night all the time ASSC cry-FV
‘the baby cried all night’
Progressive:
(59) vay ké
bá(r)
dùkrí kerker
kə
tʃiʔ-i
baby PROG lie down night all the time ASSC cry-FV
‘the baby was crying all night long’
Perfective:
(60) na tí kúm-ú
1SG go day before yesterday
‘I went the day before yesterday’
Progressive:
(61) na ké
ti kúm-ú
1SG PROG go day before yesterday
‘I was going the day before yesterday’
As is often the case with markers of aspect, the specific aspectual or temporal
function of ké may depend on surrounding discourse and/or knowledge shared
by the speaker and hearer. The following example may thus have several interpretations:
(62) Gwà ké
súk
wə
Mayo-Lope
G. PROG stay, live PREP M.-L.
‘Gwa lived/was living/used to live in Mayo-Lope’ (in answer to a question
or as a preface to a sequential clause)
Use of additional markers outside of the domains of tense and aspect may be
used to narrow the meaning of the clause (English translations are approximate):
(63) Gwà ké
súk
wə
Mayo-Lope si
G. PROG stay, live PREP M.-L.
ASSERT
‘Gwa lived/was living in Mayo-Lope’

(64) Gwà ké
suk
wə
Mayo-Lope riʔ-i
G. PROG live, stay PREP M.-L.
already-FV
‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope’
In many cases the clause marked for progressive aspect provides information
necessary for the proper understanding of the clause that follows, as in the next
example:
(65) ta ké
ɓáy kum
àmá tám ta tsú ɓáy zaʔ mi
3F PROG pretty yesterday but today 3F NEG pretty still NEG
‘she used to be pretty, but she isn’t pretty anymore’ (note the use of kum
‘yesterday’ in broad reference to the past)
The progressive aspect in Pévé can be used in an independent clause whose
proper interpretation depends on the clause that preceded it in conversation.
For example, the progressive may be used in a response to a content question,
whose inherent function is to seek more information about a given situation.
The clause marked for progressive aspect provides that information:
(66) na ké
in
dàn kə
rù
1SG PROG speak word ASSC 2M.POSS
‘I was talking to you’ (in answer to ‘what were you doing?’)
3.4
Unmarked Aspect
3.4.1
Form
The unmarked aspect is characterized by underlying tone on the verb and the
absence of a non-verbal tense or aspect marker. The unmarked aspect is found
in both independent clauses and dependent clauses:
(67) na wàʔ ʔyá (ye)
1SG want leave PERM
‘I want to leave’
(68) na tsú bə̀ ɬew də́ mi
1SG NEG like meat dog NEG
‘I don’t like dog meat’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3152chapter 8(69) mum tʃí vun rùm-u
syemɗe ùm
ɗe ma su
3M ask 3M.POSS-FV name 3M.POSS call how Q
‘He asked him, “What do they call him?”’
The unmarked aspect is the form used in subjunctive clauses, as marked by a
subject pronoun from the subjunctive set (see chapter 6):
(70) à láʔá
fãmbə
tám-a
ha láʔ á
faŋ mbə
tám-a
2M say 1SG.SBJV repeat come today-FV
‘you said I should come here again today’
(71) à
pum nùm ye
2M.SBJV hit 3M.O PERM
‘hit him!’ or ‘you can hit him!’ (‘can’ is used here in the permissive sense)
The imperfective aspect marker wə́ can be optional in a clause referring to an
unbounded event. Since the verb following the imperfective marker has its
underlying tone, deleting wə́ results in a clause in the unmarked tense/aspect,
raising the question of whether there really is an unmarked tense/aspect:
(72) May (wə́) ɗi fún ɓay Gwà (wə́) gi tsoɓ rum
lúmò
M. IMPF cook food CONJ G. IMPF sell
3M.POSS market
‘May cooks food and Gwa sells it at the market’
The evidence that there is an unmarked aspectual form that is distinct from the
imperfective or any other aspect is provided by the fact that there are indicative clauses in which neither the perfective high tone nor an overt tense/aspect
marker, including wə́, can be used. This is true of the subjunctive clause below:
(73) mum *wə́/*də̀
gewa mbə̀ sədayʔ
dáyʔ
3M IMPF/FUT return come day after tomorrow day after
for ‘he should come back in three days’
In the following example, the verb ɗə is not marked for tense or aspect and can
occur only in its underlying form. Reference to the future is provided solely by
the temporal adverbial siw:
(74) à
ɗə/*ɗə́ nan siw-i
2M.SBJV call
1SG.O tomorrow-FV
‘call me tomorrow’
Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3153tense and aspectSimilarly with the verb mbə̀ ‘come’, which retains its underlying low tone
even in reference to the future:
(75) Taú láʔ mum mbə̀ siw-i
T. say 3M come tomorrow-FV
‘Tau said he will come tomorrow’
In the main clause of the following example neither wə́ (IMPF) or də̀ (FUT)
can be used before the verb ‘to say’. The use of the non-perfective pronoun ùm
to indicate the addressee rules out the perfective interpretation, leaving the
unmarked aspect as the only possible meaning:
(76) lum gwàʔ *wə́/*də̀
ùm in ne na
à
kar riʔ
lion then IMPF/FUT 3M.O say ADP I.PRO 2M.SBJV look already
mbə̀ tí
rìʔi
come PROX.F already
for ‘Lion then says to him, “Look here!”’
Compare with the perfective form, where the addressee is marked by nùm, not
ùm, and the adposition ne precedes the addressee. The future marker is omitted in the complement clause, leaving only the choice of pronoun (màn, the
non-perfective 1SG object) and the constituent order SOV as markers of the
non-perfective aspect:
(77) mum lɛ́ʔ né nəm ha lambə
sí
ha man yè
mum láʔ ne nùm ha láʔ

ha màn yè
3M say ADP 3M.O 2M COND come ASSERT 2M 1SG.O know

ASSERT
‘He told him, “If you come here, you will know me.” ’
3.4.2
Function
The interpretation of the unmarked aspect depends on context. When there
is no adverbial or other marker indicating the temporal structure of the event,
the unmarked aspect may be interpreted as pertaining to the time of speech,
as is the case with the form waʔ ‘want’ in the following:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3154chapter 8(78) na wadà

‘I want to tell the story about my most recent trip from Maroua to Garoua
last Friday.’
The unmarked aspect may also indicate a habitual or unbounded event. Use of
a temporal adverbial may narrow the scope of the unmarked aspect:
(79) tá gi tsoɓ súm ( fə̀tà lúmò)
3F sell
beer day market
‘she sells beer (on the day of the market)’
The unmarked aspect may describe an unbounded state that obtains at the
time of speech:
(80) Gwà toŋ pã
May si
G. large exceed M. ASSERT
‘Gwa is bigger than May’
The unmarked aspect may also describe an unbounded state that obtained
prior to the time of speech:
(81) motaʔ
ɗáw tsugàk
tsùwal mi
mòtaʔ (borr.) ɗáw tsú
gàk tsùwal mi
car (Ful.)
one NEG can cross NEG
‘Not one car could cross it.’ (before the time of speech)
The constituent order in the unmarked tense/aspect is the same as that of a
clause in any other non-perfective aspect (see chapter 6). In the next example,
the order S V O IO ne, along with the choice of pronoun from the non-perfective
set, makes it clear that the clause is non-perfective, even though there is no
overt tense/aspect marker:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3155tense and aspect(82) mum taʔ kwá màn ne gwa
3M teach thing 1SG.O ADP now
‘he is teaching me right now’
Cf. the perfective form, with high tone on the verb:
(83) mum táʔ kwá ne nàn
3M show thing ADP 1SG.O
‘he taught/showed me something’
The unmarked tense/aspect can refer to a habitual action that did take place
or did not take place:
(84) handày ɗam só
ɓáy-à
3PL
build house good-FV
‘they build houses well’ (‘their house-building is good’)
(85) mum tsú sə́ tsoɓ man ne kpe mì
3M NEG 3F.O buy 1SG.O ADP never NEG
‘he never buys mine (‘what is mine’)’
The imperfective form cannot be used to describe an irrealis event:
(86) mum *wə́ tsú sə́ tsoɓ man ne kpe mì
3M IMPF NEG 3F.O buy 1SG.O ADP never NEG
for ‘he never buys mine’
In the subjunctive clause the unmarked aspect may refer to a bounded event
(recall that the form of the subject pronoun is often the sole means of marking
the clause as subjunctive):
(87) ì
mbə̀ ni
riʔ-i

4chapter 8ConclusionThe indicative clause distinguishes the future tense, marked by the preverbal
marker də̀; the perfective aspect, marked by relative high tone on the verb;
the imperfective aspect, marked by the preverbal marker wə́; the progressive
aspect, marked by the preverbal marker ké; and the unmarked aspect, characterized by underlying tone on the verb and the absence of any other external
markers. Only the unmarked aspect is attested in the subjunctive clause.
The perfective aspect describes a singulative event that was or will be completed, while the imperfective describes a state or event ongoing at the time of
speech or some other specified time. The progressive aspect marks a clause as
essential to understanding the material that follows the marked clause or as a
response to a preceding question. The interpretation of the unmarked aspect
depends on context and the nature of the event. In the indicative clause, the
unmarked aspect may refer to ongoing, repeated, habitual or unbounded event;
in the subjunctive clause, the unmarked aspect may also refer to a bounded or
singulative event.","[155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3315adjunct phrases and clauses6Purpose ClausesThe form kə́dàn, probably a compound consisting of the associative preposition kə and the noun dàn ‘word, matter’, marks the clause that follows as the

The same-subject purpose clause may have an overt subject, which renders it
an independent clause:

3PL

help (‘take hand’) RECIP
‘they came so that they could help each other’
In the following sentence the purpose clause is not marked by kə́dàn and does
not have a subject. The result is a sequence of two compound verbs, ʔyá táy ‘to
depart for’ and gi tsoɓ ‘to sell’. Omission of the purpose marker kə́dàn is a likely
source for some serial verb constructions:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3316chapter 21(79) brògò …

The preposition zə̀ followed by the question word mi forms a question about

PREP what 2M insult 1SG.O Q
‘why did you insult me?’8Positive AdjunctPévé has an adjunct whose function is to emphasize the existence or actuality
of an event or state. Native speaker Wambadang views the function of kətáʔ
as the opposite of that of the negative marker tsu … mi (see chapter 14), henceErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3317adjunct phrases and clausesthe use of the term ‘positive adjunct’. The adjunct in question, kətaʔ, occurs in
sentence-final or clause-final position. The English translation is approximate:
(83) ha wé kwa tí
kətaʔ-a
2M see thing PROX.F POS-FV
‘you really saw something’
(84) mum làʔ
də̀ mbə̀ kətáʔ si sáyʔ
na gíláʔ tú
3M COND FUT come POS REL OBLIG 1SG ready body
rìn-ì
1SG.POSS-FV
‘if he actually comes, I must be ready’
Evidence that kətáʔ is an adjunct is that the form can be deleted from a sentence with very little change in meaning. In the following sentence, the use of
kətáʔ emphasizes the past-time temporal status of the clause:
(85) namba ké kə́
sə̀lay kətáʔ-a
1PL
COP ASSC money POS-FV
‘we used to have money’ (but not anymore)
Removing kətaʔ does not affect grammatical or temporal relations, but simply
removes emphasis from the temporal status:
(86) namba ké kə́
sə̀lay-a
1PL
COP ASSC money-FV
‘we used to have money’
Further evidence for the positive function of kətaʔ is that the form cannot occur
in the same clause with the negative marker (tsu) … mi:
(87) ta tsú kə
sə̀lày mì *kətáʔ-a
3F NEG ASSC money NEG POS-FV
for ‘she does not have money’ (or any other meaning)
It is likely that the first syllable of the positive marker kətáʔ stems from the
associative preposition kə. A potential source for the syllable táʔ is the verb táʔ
‘show’ (see chapter 8 and elsewhere).","[330, 331, 332, 333]"

"5Notes on the TranscriptionIn transcriptions of natural discourse data, the top line represents the author’s
auditory perception of the utterance of the native speaker, sometimes with
the help of the Praat program (www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/). The second line
shows the underlying form of each morpheme used in the utterance. In transcriptions throughout the text there are some inconsistencies in the underlying
form, as it is not always clear which form is underlying and which represents a
variation. This is complicated by dialectal variations in the pronunciation of a
given form.
The third line in a natural discourse example contains the gloss of the underlying meaning and/or function of each element of the utterance, in accordance
with the Leipzig glossing rules. The fourth line consists of a colloquial English
translation of the Pévé utterance. Here is an example of a natural discourse
transcription. The term ‘lit.’ refers to the literal or underlying meaning of a
form:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-310chapter 1(1) mum tʃívə
rum-u
mum tʃí vun
rùm-u
3M ask (lit. ‘request mouth’) 3M.POSS-FV
‘He asked him.’ (FV: final vowel; see chapter 2)
Some examples occur more than once in the present volume. The translation,
and occasionally the gloss, of a given example may differ slightly from one
occurrence to another, depending on the topic of the surrounding narrative
and the function(s) that the example has been chosen to demonstrate.
Elicited examples consist of three lines: The underlying morphemes, as perceived by speaker and listener; the gloss showing the meaning and/or function
of each morpheme; and the English translation of the utterance. The translation of an elicited example begins with a capital letter only if the first element
of the utterance is a proper name. An elicited example may end with a question
mark, an exclamation point, or zero punctuation:
(2) à
mbə̀ riʔ-i
2M.SBJV come already-FV
‘you’d better come here!’
(3) mum wé nàn wa
vari
3M see 1SG.O PREP (lit. ‘head’) road
‘he saw me on the road’ (zero punctuation)
In the top line (i.e. Pévé form) of the transcription, a slash between two morphemes indicates that either morpheme, but not both, can be used in the same
utterance:
(4) ma/swə
wé nàn-a
person (f.)/person (m.) see 1SG.O-FV
‘someone saw me’
Slashes between morphemes on the gloss level indicate that the morpheme in
question has multiple meanings or functions:
(5) mum kəɗam
kə
sowã dáŋʔ
3M nice/good ASSC people all
‘he is kind to everyone’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-311the pévé languageIn the transcription and in the text, the marker ~ indicates that a given
form has more than one pronunciation, as in tsóhoʔ ~ tswóhoʔ ‘eight’ and go ~
gwaʔ ‘then’. Partially or fully reduplicated forms are marked by a word-internal
hyphen, as in ryéŋ-ryéŋ(e) ‘very small, thin’ and tʃiriŋ-riŋ ‘very deep’.
A parenthesized component in the Pévé form is considered by the native
speaker to be optional in the utterance in question:
(6) May (wə́) ɗi fún
M. IMPF cook food
‘May cooks food’ (ɗi fún and wə́ ɗi fún have the same meaning)
A parenthesized component in the English translation is intended for clarification and does not directly correspond to any morpheme in the Pévé version,
e.g.:
(7) na tsoɓ ʒyè
wũ ne ɓo
1SG buy peanuts 2M.O ADP PROM
‘I (will) definitely buy you some peanuts’
A bracketed morpheme or phrase in the top line or second line of a natural discourse example represents a self-correction made by the native speaker after
listening to a recording of his own text:
(8) ɓay mùm tʃí vun rùmu
[syemɗe rùm …] (error) syemɗe
CONJ 3M ask 3M.POSS name 3M.POSS
name
ùm [correction] ɗe ma su
3M.POSS
call what Q
‘… and he (guinea fowl) asked him, “What is his name?” ’ (rùm: 3M inalienable possessor; ùm: 3M alienable possessor; see chapter 5)
As is the case in many languages, there is often free variation in the pronunciation of certain phonemes, especially those that involve a stop or fricative
followed by a high or mid front vowel. This is particularly true with respect
to underlying vs. surface tone, since the latter may be affected by intonation
and stress patterns, which themselves may be affected by context, previous discourse, the speaker’s motivation, and other factors. The phonemic structure
and tone of examples throughout the text are transcribed as heard by the listener but do not always represent the underlying form from the native speaker’s
perspective. As a result, there may be inconsistencies in the transcription of
certain morphemes described in the text below. For clarity, the attached Pévé-Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-312chapter 1English lexicon provides what the native speaker views to be the underlying
tone and phonemic form of a given morpheme, while the English-Pévé lexicon provides transcriptions of free variations observed in natural and elicited
examples.","[25, 26, 27, 28]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-340chapter 2In a few cases a vowel in an open syllable is manifested as a long vowel, but
this does not appear to be phonemic:
yii /yi/
goo /go/
ngoo /ngo/
saa /sa/
ʒyèe /ʒyè/‘squirrel’
(word of consolation, permission or politeness; see chapter 9)
‘dry tree (ready to be cut down and burned)’
‘who’ (content question word)
‘peanut(s)’3.2
Nasalized Vowels
The nasalized vowels /ĩ, ẽ, ã, õ, ũ/ are attested in open syllables, before the glottal stop, and before the palatal and alveolar glides. In all of these environments,
nasalized vowels contrast with non-nasalized (oral) vowels:
vĩ
kĩ ́
nẽʔ
mbã
gwãʔ
gã
sowã
bùwõ ̀
wũ
wãy
nãw‘vast, limitless’ vs. vìʔ ‘to lose (something)’
‘small’ vs. ki ‘back; backside of something’
‘hippopotamus’, ‘curse’ (N) vs. ne ‘to give’
‘to respect’ vs. mbà (1PL object pronoun)
(tiny flying insect) vs. gwáʔ ‘then’
‘brush, low trees’; ‘to freeload’ vs. gàʔ ‘side’
‘people’ vs. so ‘house, village’
‘rain’ (N) vs. ɓo (modal particle)
(2M object pronoun) vs. wuʔ ‘to pour a liquid’
‘last, most recent’ vs. ʔway ‘to herd, to chase’
‘bovine’ vs. ɗáw ‘one’Some nasalized vowels are clearly surface realizations of an underlying sequence of a vowel followed by a nasal consonant. For example, when the noun
ʃĩŋ ‘smell’ (nasalized vowel) is followed by the trill /r/, as in ʃiŋ rùm ‘his smell’,
the nasalized vowel in ʃĩŋ is replaced by an oral vowel ( ʃiŋ), providing evidence
that /ʃiŋ/ is the underlying form. Further evidence that the nasalized vowel is
not underlying is provided by use of the oral vowel in the reduplicated form
ʃi-ʃĩ (non-nasalized+nasalized) ‘to smell something’.
Phrase-final vowel addition, in its function as parsing morphology (chapter 3), provides clues for the origin of some nasalized vowels. When the phraseinternal form or isolated form of a lexical item ends in a nasalized vowel,
phrase-final vowel addition sometimes results in a velar nasal consonant
flanked by oral vowels. For example, the noun bùwõ ̀ ‘rain’ becomes bùwòŋò in
phrase-final position, suggesting that nasalization of the final /o/ in bùwõ ̀ had
its origins in an underlying final velar nasal consonant.","[55, 56]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3verbless and copular predications199Furthermore, like other verbs (see chapter 8), kè carries high tone when the
clause refers to a time before the time of speech:
(17) ta ké bay màn-à
3F COP friend 1SG-FV
‘she was my friend’
In an equational predication with future time reference, the copula has low
tone and is preceded by the future tense marker də̀, providing further evidence
that kè is a verb while na is not:
(18) ta də̀ kè bay màn-a
3F FUT COP friend 1SG-FV
‘she will be my friend’
Cf. the form with reference to the time of speech (recall that na is not necessary
in an equational clause of the form Pronoun Noun):
(19) ta bay màn-a
3F friend 1SG-FV
‘she is my friend’
As previously mentioned, the clause-final impersonal pronoun na rarely cooccurs with another clause-final marker. A content question about the identity
of a human participant (see chapter 13) has the form of an equational predication whose predicate is the content question word sa ‘who’. The clause-final
impersonal pronoun na does not occur, since the clause-final interrogative
marker su itself marks the end of the clause:
(20) ta sa su
3F who Q
‘who is she?’ (lit. ‘she [is] who?’)
A question about a non-human participant has mi ‘what’ as the subject and
a deictic demonstrative as the predicate. The relative marker mə before the
demonstrative is optional and the impersonal pronoun na does not occur:
(21) mi (mə)ni su
what PROX Q
‘what [is] this?’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3200chapter 11(22) mi (mə)nayʔ su

‘what [is] that?’
3.2
Pronoun as Predicate
An equational predication with a pronoun as predicate corresponds to ‘X is
mine/yours/his/hers’, etc. Unlike the English translation, the pronoun serving
as predicate in Pévé is from the set of indicative subject pronouns (see chapter 6), not the set of possessive pronouns. The pronoun serving as predicate is
preceded by the relative marker mə̀. A clause-final marker, such as the impersonal pronoun na, must be used to indicate that the sequence Subject mə̀ Pronoun clause is an independent clause (see section 2, above):
(23) ya nãw kunə mə nambà na
cow PL REL 1PL
I.PRO
‘those cows are ours’
vs.
(24) ya nãw kunə mə nambà
cow PL REL 1PL
‘our cows there …’
The equational predication with a pronoun as predicate is distinct from the
attributive clause, in which the pronoun modifies the subject (see section 4,
below). In the attributive clause, the modifying pronoun is from the possessive
set:
(25) ya nãw man
na
cow 1SG.POSS I.PRO
‘it/that is my cow’
Cf. the equational predication, with an indicative subject pronoun:
(26) yá nãw mə̀ na na
cow REL 1SG I.PRO
‘the cow is mine’
A clause-final marker, such as the negative mì or an added final vowel, can also
mark the end of the equational clause, rendering the phrase-final impersonal
pronoun na unnecessary:
Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3verbless and copular predications201(27) mum tsú tsoɓ mə na kpe mì ama

3M NEG buy PREP 1SG never NEG but (Ar.) 3M buy PREP
ha taw sar-a
2M only simply-FV
‘he never buys mine (‘what is mine’); he only buys yours’ (‘what is yours’)4Attributive PredicationThe attributive predication is a verbless clause of the form Noun/Pronoun
Modifier, where the modifier denotes an attribute of the subject noun or pronoun. Like other verbless predications, the attributive predication must end
with a clause-final marker, which may consist of an added final vowel (FV) or a
marker that is inherently clause-final. In the next example, the marker of completeness is the clause-final assertive marker sí (cf. chapter 9):
(28) Sə́ráy jáŋ sí
S.
tall ASSERT
‘Sə́ ráy is tall’
Without the assertive marker, the construction cannot stand alone and therefore cannot act as an attributive predication:
(29) Sə́ráy jáŋ
S.
tall
‘tall Sə́ rá …’
A phrase-final added vowel (see chapter 3) is sometimes the sole marker of
completeness of the predication:
(30) ta bròʔ-o
3F ugly-FV
‘she is ugly’
(31) mum ɗáw sar-a
3M one only-FV
‘he is alone’
(32) ya ndaʔ
rə
uraʔ-a
mare (lit. ‘female horse’) DED.F black-FV
‘that mare is black’
Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3202chapter 11Without the final vowel, the construction cannot stand alone:
(33) ya ndaʔ
rə
uraʔ
mare (lit. ‘female horse’) DED.F black
‘that black mare …’
An attributive predicate that is not an inherent modifier must be overtly
marked for the modifying function. For example, a noun that functions as a
modifier is preceded by the relative marker mə̀. The resulting construction is
not a relative clause (see chapter 17). The evidence for this is that the attributive predication, unlike the relative clause, can stand alone as an independent
clause:
(34) ya nãw mə̀ ɓú
cow REL whiteness
‘the cow is white’ (not ‘the cow that is white …’)
The chief formal difference between the relative clause and an attributive
predication with a nominal predicate is the lack of a resumptive pronoun in
the attributive predication. With the resumptive pronoun ti, the construction
serves as a relative clause rather than an independent attributive clause. The
relative clause cannot function as an independent clause:
(35) ya nãw mə̀ ti
ɓú
cow REL PRO whiteness
‘the cow that is white …’
The difference between the relative clause and the attributive predication is
further illustrated by the next example. The first instance of the form mə̀ marks
the verb phrase tà kə syem ‘walks on legs’ as an attribute of the subject kwá
‘thing’. There is no resumptive pronoun within the phrase, so the phrase is
attributive. The attributive phrase [kwá mə̀ tà kə syem] is itself the head of a
larger clause that is marked by the second instance of mə̀. The evidence that the
larger clause is a relative clause and not an attributive clause is that the marker
mə̀ in the larger clause is followed by the masculine resumptive pronoun ni. The
end of the relative clause is marked by the masculine post-relative marker nə̀
(chapter 17), which does not occur in the attributive clause. The lengthy relative
clause kwá … nə̀ in turn functions as the subject of a larger attributive predication whose predicate is kəlìŋ ‘rat’. The status of the sentence as an independent
identificational clause is marked by the clause-final impersonal pronoun na:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3203verbless and copular predications(36) kwá mə̀ tà kə

I.PRO-FV
‘the animal (‘thing walking on legs’) that we saw, it is a rat’
As is the case in equational and identificational constructions, the attributive
clause with past or future time reference is marked by the copula kè. The copula
has high tone in reference to past time:
(37) ta ké ɓáy kum
àmá
tám ta tsú ɓáy zaʔ mi
3F COP pretty yesterday but (Ar.) today 3F NEG pretty still NEG
‘she was pretty yesterday, but she is not pretty today’
Cf. the same notion with reference to the time of speech, where kè does not
occur:
(38) ta ɓáy
3F pretty
‘she is pretty’
(39) tsoɓ rum
ké ɓáyrúm-u
price 3M.POSS COP much-FV
‘its price was high’
Cf.
(40) tsoɓ rum
ɓáyrúm-u
price 3M.POSS much-FV
‘its price is high’
In an attributive clause that refers to future time, the future marker də̀ precedes
the copula and the copula carries its underlying low tone:
(41) tsoɓ rum də̀ kè ɓáyrúm
price 3M FUT COP much
‘its price will be high’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3204
5chapter 11Possessive PredicationLike most Chadic languages described so far, Pévé has no verb of possession
corresponding to English ‘to have’ or its equivalent in other Indo-European languages. The possessive predication has the form Possessor kə Possessum (the
thing possessed), where kə is the associative preposition:
(42) ta kə
sə̀lay-a
3F ASSC money-FV
‘she has money’ (lit. ‘she (is) with money’)
(43) ta tsú kə
sə̀lày mì
3F NEG ASSC money NEG
‘she does not have money’
The attribute ‘hot’ is also conveyed by a possessive construction:
(44) fún
nə
kə
ku
boule/food PROX ASSC heat, fire
‘this food is hot’ (lit. ‘with heat’)
The inanimate subject does not have to be overtly marked in the clause, provided the subject is understood:
(45) kə
ku
ASSC heat, fire
‘(it) is hot’
The resemblance between the copula kè and the associative preposition kə
might suggest a path of evolution from one function to the other, but this is
rendered unlikely by the fact that the two markers can be used together, each
retaining its own function:
(46) namba ké kə́
sə̀lay-a
1PL
COP ASSC money-FV
‘we used to have money’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3verbless and copular predications6205ConclusionAn independent verbless clause must be marked as such by a clause-final added
vowel, the interrogative marker su, the assertive marker si, the clause-final
impersonal pronoun na, and perhaps other means of marking the end of a
clause. Verbless clauses are attested in the domains of identificational predication, equational predication, and attributive predication. The impersonal
pronoun na is used in such predications only if the clause in question refers
to a state or event that exists or takes place at the time of speech. If the clause
refers to a point in time before or after the time of speech, the clause is marked
instead by the copula kè. Like other verbs, the copula carries high tone in the
perfective function and is preceded by the marker də́ in the future tense function. The absence of the copula kè, the impersonal pronoun na, or some other
means of marking the end of a clause renders the verbless clause a dependent

"4Reference to an Unspecified EntityAn unspecified entity differs from a deducible entity in that the unspecified
entity may or may not be known to the speaker or listener. Reference to an
unspecified entity does not instruct the listener to deduce the referent, since
the referent may not be deducible.
Reference to an unspecified human entity can be indicated by the nouns

in discourse. The referent in question may be an entity, a location, an event, a
manner, a speech act, or a point in time. As shown in section 3, a previously
mentioned entity does not have to be overtly marked as previously mentioned,
and there appears to be no marker whose sole function is to indicate previous
reference. Pronouns, however, do play a role in previous mention, as shown
below. When an entity is represented by a pronoun, a distinction is drawn
between animate previous reference and inanimate previous reference. The
previously mentioned object of a preposition, whether animate or inanimate,
is marked by the unique form ndí, described in section 5.2, below.
5.1
Pronouns and Previous Mention
5.1.1
Animate Previous Mention
Reference to a previously mentioned third-person animate entity, human or
non-human, can be marked by a pronoun from one of the sets described in
chapter 5. In the data used for the present project, there is only one instance in
which the third-person animate pronoun is omitted. There is thus a distinction
between animate previous mention (marked) and inanimate previous mention
(unmarked).
In coding reference to a third-person animate entity there is no distinction
between coreferential and non-coreferential pronouns within the same utterance:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3system of reference215(33) ɛɛ kəri mə̀ni … mum ʔín ne nùm ndə́ naʔ-a …. bròk

5.1.2
Inanimate Previous Mention
The absence of an overt marker of a third-person argument tells the listener
that the referent of the argument is both inanimate and previously mentioned:
(37) na tsóɓ vu na tsóɓ kúm-ú
1SG buy salt 1SG buy yesterday
‘I bought salt, I bought [it] yesterday’
(38) na də̀ ti síw-i

ne nàn riʔi
2M.SBJV give 1SG.O OBLIG
‘you should give [it] to me’ (we have been talking about the thing to be
given)
A previously mentioned inanimate third-person subject can also be omitted,
resulting in a clause without an overt subject:
(40) kə
ku
ASSC fire
‘[the food] is hot’ (lit. ‘with fire’; the food has been mentioned previously)
The absence of an overt marker does not necessarily indicate reference to the
nearest previously mentioned entity, as shown in the next example:
(41) laʔ
tsoɓ rum
ɓáyrúm si,
i
tsoɓ gaʔ ri
məsin
COND buy 3M.POSS much ASSERT 2PL buy side place other
ye
PERM
‘if its price is high, you can buy [it] somewhere else’
Indicating an inanimate argument by means of zero-coding is probably tied to
the fact that there is no neuter pronoun corresponding to ‘it’ in Pévé. Compare
the following examples, where the animate object is marked and the inanimate
object is unmarked:
(42) Tau də̀ sə/um
fol-o
T. FUT 3F.O/3M.O slaughter-FV
‘Tau will slaughter her/him’
vs.
(43) Tau də̀ fol-o
T. FUT slaughter-FV
‘Tau will slaughter [it].’
Because the previously mentioned inanimate entity is usually unmarked, reference to such an entity by means of a third-person masculine or feminine
pronoun places the object in focus (see chapter 15):Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3system of reference217(44) na ti sə́/nùm

5.2
Object of the Preposition kə
Pévé has a unique pronoun form ndi that is used solely to represent the object of
the associative preposition kə. The object of the preposition is a singular thirdperson entity, animate or inanimate, that has been previously mentioned or
whose reference can be deduced by the listener. The form ndi, glossed OP for
‘object of a preposition’, is not a member of any known pronoun set in Pévé and
is not attested with any prepositions other than kə:
(46) na faŋ
Garoua kə
ndi
1SG return Garoua PREP OP
‘I returned to Garoua with it.’
Cf. a similar construction in which the object of the preposition is represented
by a noun:
(47) Taú fól
sə́ kə
àtsíw
T. slaughter 3F.O ASSC knife
‘Tau slaughtered her (the cow) with a knife’
Another pair of examples:
(48) ha mbə́ kə
sə̀lày si
su
2M come ASSC money ASSERT Q
‘did you bring (lit. ‘come with’) money?’
(49) àwo na mbə́ kə
ndi si
yes 1SG come ASSC OP ASSERT
‘yes, I brought (‘came with’) it’
The form ndi is not limited to an inanimate referent:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3218chapter 12(50) swə mə̀ ni ɬé nàn mbə́ ti
kə

bay
man REL PRO take 1SG.O come PROX ASSC OP POST friend
màn-à
1SG.POSS-FV
‘the man who brought me here (lit. ‘took me to come here with him’) is
my friend’
Evidence for the referential function of ndi is that it does not co-occur with a
pronoun referring to a human entity:
(51) àwo na mbə́ kə
sə/rum
si
yes 1SG come ASSC 3F.O/3M.O ASSERT
‘yes, I brought (‘came with’) her/him’
The phrase kə ndi can be used in a clause describing possession of a previously
mentioned inanimate object (recall that Pévé does not have a verb corresponding to ‘to have, to own’):
(52) ta kə
ndi
3F ASSC OP
‘she has it’ (lit. ‘she (is) with it’)
The function of the phrase kə ndi is not limited to previous mention, as shown
by the following example:
(53) ta gí tsoɓ hu ɓay ta tsóɓ mbraw kə
ndi
3F sell
goat CONJ 3F buy clothing ASSC OP
‘she sold a goat and bought clothing with it (the money from the sale)’
There appears to be no plural form corresponding to ndi. Instead, the plural
object of kə is marked by a plural pronoun from the perfective/subjunctive
object pronoun set described in chapter 6:
(54) yii
ɮé kə
ʒi gày kə
nday
squirrel start ASSC play gàyʔ ASSC 3PL.O
‘Squirrel immediately started to play gàyʔ with them.’
The fact that the inanimate object of the preposition kə must be overtly coded
even though the inanimate object of a verb is usually unmarked (see inanimate
previous reference, above) is explained by the fact that a preposition cannotErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3system of reference219function as a preposition without a complement. The origin of the pronoun ndi
in Pévé remains to be explained, as it does not resemble any other third-person
pronoun forms in the language. The pronoun ndi bears some resemblance the
pronoun dì in Giziga (Central Chadic; Shay 2012, ms.), whose function is to indicate the presence of an additional third-person argument without specifying
the syntactic or semantic function of the argument.
5.3
Anaphoric Location
The demonstrative han, glossed ‘there’, represents anaphoric reference to a
location that is not the place of speech. The marker is distinct from all deictic demonstratives described in section 6 below. Here is an example of han in
natural discourse:

5.4
Anaphoric Reference in Other Domains
Pévé also has means of marking anaphoric reference in a number of other
domains, including event, manner, speech act, or point in time. The impersonal
pronoun na, preceded by the equal-comparison marker ndí ‘like’ (ndə́ when
phrase-internal), codes anaphoric reference to a previously described event,Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3220chapter 12state or manner. As shown in chapter 11, the impersonal pronoun na also has
the function of marking a verbless construction as an independent clause. In
the next sequence, the first example describes the event and the second example refers back to the event, as indicated by the phrase ndə́ na:
(58) mum pe ndáʔ
3M hit horse
‘he hit a horse’
(59) mum gí ndə́ na
syem hoɓ
3M do like I.PRO time two
‘he did that twice’
The phrase ndə́ na may also indicate anaphoric or deictic reference to the type
or manner of an event:
(60) ndzə̀r
rin
gí ndə́ na
brother 1SG.POSS do like I.PRO
‘my brother behaved like that’
(61) ha ul
mi ndə́ na
su
2M cough what like I.PRO Q
‘why are you coughing like that?’
The phrase ndə́ na after a verb of saying marks anaphoric reference to a speech
act:

ɛɛ kəri mə̀ni mum ín ne nùm ndə́ naʔ-a

‘When he told him that (lit. ‘said to him like that’), Monitor Lizard asked
him, “What do they call you?”’
Reference to a previously mentioned point in time can be marked by the form
kəri followed by a possessive pronoun referring to the subject. The form kəri is
derived from the associative preposition kə followed by the noun ri ‘time, place’
(other functions of the marker kəri are described in chapter 18):Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3221system of referencefã ́ŋ (error) fã ́ɮé (error)

a temporal noun followed by a masculine possessive pronoun:

‘on that day (‘its day’), the war began’

‘we got married (‘put with each other’) on that day (‘its day’)’6Deictic ReferenceThe domain of deictic reference in Pévé includes (a) the position of a geographic location with respect to the place of speech (spatial deixis), (b) the
position of an entity with respect to the place of speech (entity deixis), and
(c) reference to a point in time with respect to the time of speech (temporal
deixis). Markers of spatial and entity deixis distinguish between proximity to
the place of speech (proximal deixis) and unspecified distance from the place
of speech (distal deixis). Forms that mark deictic reference include determiners and demonstratives.
6.1
Spatial Deixis
The term ‘spatial deixis’ refers to the relationship between a location and the
place of speech. Markers of spatial deixis distinguish between proximal and
distal location, as shown below. What may be a unique feature of Pévé is the
fact that spatial deixis markers reflect the gender of the entity whose location
is described.","[228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237]"
"2Indicative ClausesIn most instances, negation of the indicative clause is coded by the negative
marker tsú immediately after the subject noun or pronoun and the negative
marker mì at the end of the clause. Following are examples in various aspects

Cf. the affirmative unmarked aspect:
(4) tá gi tsoɓ súm fə̀tà lúmò

The non-existence of an entity can be coded through negation of the affirmative clause:

The same variations in constituent order that occur in affirmative clauses also
occur in negative clauses. For example, in the future tense there is an alternation between the form S Tense/Aspect V O IO ne and the form S Tense/Aspect
IO V O (see chapter 8). Either form can be negated by the same means, namely
post-subject tsú and clause-final mì:
S NEG Tense/Aspect V O IO ne NEG:

3F NEG ASSC money NEG
‘she does not have money’
Cf.:
(12) ta kə

3F ASSC money-FV
‘she has money’
Neither of the negative markers tsú or mì can be omitted when the negative
clause is used in isolation, and most negative clauses in natural discourse also
use both negative markers. However, tsú can be omitted in a negative clause
that is a response to a question:
(13) Taú (tsú) tá lúmò mì
T. NEG go market NEG
‘Tau didn’t go to the market’ (in response to ‘Did he go to the market?’)
As shown in chapter 9, the marker tsú is also not used in the prohibitive
clause:

The same is true for the informal version:
(16) à
tsoɓ mbraw ne nàn ɗáw mi
2M.SBJV buy clothing ADP 1SG.O one NEG
‘do not buy any clothing for me!’
The assertive marker si cannot be used in the negative clause. This supports
the analysis that si codes the assertive mood, i.e. the speaker’s desire that the
hearer believe in the occurrence of an event (see chapter 9):
(17) handày tsú tsóɓ ya nãw mì *si
3PL
NEG buy cow NEG ASSERT
for ‘they did not buy a cow’
The sequence zaʔ mi (‘more NEG’) indicates the temporal status of the negated
event or state:
(18) na tsu ti fun zaʔ mi
1SG NEG eat food more NEG
‘I do not eat anymore’
(19) May tsú bə̀ ndʒí

M. NEG love husband 3F.POSS more NEG
‘May no longer loves her husband’
A clause marked negative can serve as an interrogative clause, depending on
context and intonation:
(20) ha tsú táʔ l’école dimanche nə
zaʔ mi
2M NEG go to school Sunday DED.M more NEG
‘you no longer go to Sunday school?’
The negated clause can also be followed by the interrogative marker su. Note
that the following clause also involves the permissive modality marker ye (see
chapter 9), evidence that modality is a distinct domain:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3240chapter 14(21) à
ta ye
zaʔ mə [mi] su
2M.SBJV walk PERM more NEG
Q
‘you’re not walking anymore?’ (the hearer was expected to continue walking)3Scope of NegationElicited examples suggest that the scope of negation in Pévé is the entire proposition rather than an entity involved in the proposition. Attempts to elicit sentences in which one referent with a given grammatical role is negated while
another referent with the same grammatical role is not negated resulted in separate clauses: a negative clause and an affirmative clause. Following is a Pévé
translation of the English construction ‘he bought a cow, not a goat’:
(22) mum tsóɓ ya nãw àmá
mum tsú tsóɓ hu mì
3M buy cow but (Ar.) 3M NEG buy goat NEG
‘he bought a cow, but he did not buy a goat’
Translation of the English ‘he doesn’t buy mine, only yours’ also results in two
separate clauses:
(23) mum tsú tsoɓ mə na kpe mì ama
mum tsoɓ mə
3M NEG buy PREP 1SG never NEG but (Ar.) 3M buy PREP
ha taw sar-a
2M only-FV
‘he never buys (what is) mine; he only buys (what is) yours’4ConclusionMost negative clauses involve the marker tsú after the subject noun or pronoun
and the marker mì at the end of the clause. The negative marker tsú can be omitted in a prohibitive clause or in a negative clause that is a response to a question.
Tense and aspect are coded in the negative clause as they are in the affirmative
clause. The scope of negation is the entire clause, not a single constituent.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3chapter 9Mood and Modality
1IntroductionThis chapter describes forms and functions in the domains of deontic and epistemic modality in Pévé. In most grammatical descriptions, deontic modality is
taken to include the imperative mood, typically described as commands to the
second person, and the subjunctive mood, typically described as expressing
desire, possibility, obligation, and other irrealis propositions. Unlike many languages, Pévé does not make a formal distinction between the imperative mood
and the subjunctive mood. Coding means such as the presence or absence of
an overt subject marker and the use of a dedicated set of subject pronouns
differentiate subjunctive clauses from indicative clauses in Pévé but do not differentiate commands from other functions in the deontic mood. For simplicity,
the term ‘subjunctive (mood)’ is used to refer to commands to the second person as well as clauses expressing permission, obligation, expectation, etc. with
respect to any person, from the speaker’s perspective.
Means of coding the subjunctive mood include the choice of subject pronoun, the absence of an overt subject, and the use of object pronouns from
the perfective/subjunctive set. Subcategories within the subjunctive, such as
permission, obligation, and others, are marked by clause-final or clause-initial
particles (see below). The verb in the subjunctive mood is unmarked in that it
carries its underlying tone and is not preceded by a tense or aspect marker.
The primary difference between epistemic modality and the subjunctive
mood, as described in this chapter, is that pronouns used in the epistemic
modality are from the indicative set, not the subjunctive set, and that markers
of epistemic modality may co-occur with various markers of tense or aspect.
The subjunctive mood, in contrast, uses only pronouns from the subjunctive
set (chapter 6) and can co-occur only with the unmarked tense/aspect. The
present chapter begins with a description of the subjunctive mood and a number of subdomains within the subjunctive mood, functions of which include
the speaker’s prohibition of an event, the speaker’s statement of obligation
concerning an event, and the speaker’s statement of permission concerning an
event. The latter part of the chapter describes two subdomains within the epistemic mood, referred to tentatively as ‘promise mood’ and ‘assertive mood’. The
promise mood, as used in the present work, conveys the speaker’s certainty that
a future event will take place. The assertive mood, as used in this work, conveys© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020 | doi:10.1163/9789004410053_010Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3158chapter 9the speaker’s desire that the hearer believe that a given event or state did occur,
is occurring or will occur (see Palmer 2001 for discussion of the assertive function). The function of the assertive marker in Pévé, marked by the clause-final
morpheme si (glossed ‘ASSERT’), resembles the function of certain markers in
other languages, such as lè in Giziga (Shay 2012, ms.), za in Mina (Frajzyngier
and Johnston with Edwards 2005), and náx in Kapsiki (Smith 1969). Whether
the function of si in Pévé directly corresponds with the functions of markers
in other languages remains an open question. Other subdomains within the
domain of epistemic modality are described separately in chapter 18 (conditional and temporal constructions) and chapter 19 (complementation).","[172, 173, 174]"

Glides: w, y
The language distinguishes between the labio-velar glide /w/ and the palatal
glide /y/ in word-initial position:
/w/
/y/wa ‘head’ (N); we ‘to see’
ya ‘mother’; ye (marker of permission)In word-final position, the glides /w/ and /y/ contrast with one another and
with word-final vowels. The final palatal glide is attested only after the low
vowel /a/, while the final labiovelar glide is attested after /a/ and the front vowels /i/ and /e/:
ɓay
yaw
ɬew
síw‘and’ (conjunction) vs. ɓá ‘hand’ (noun)
‘miracle’ vs. ya ‘mother’
‘meat’ vs. ɬé ‘take’
‘tomorrow’ vs. si (assertive marker)The evidence that the final glide is consonantal is provided by examining parsing morphology (see Frajzyngier 2016b) in Pévé. Parsing morphology, described
in detail in chapter 3, involves a phrase-final marker whose function is to
tell the listener that the preceding phrase is complete. Parsing morphology
in Pévé involves adding a final vowel to a morpheme whose underlying form
is consonant-final. The added final vowel, glossed ‘FV’, is a copy of the vowel
that precedes the underlying final consonant. The adverbial corresponding to
‘today’ has the form tám in isolation or phrase-internal position and the form
tám-a in phrase-final position:
(6) mum tá lúmò kə
sə́ tám-a
3M go market ASSC 3F.O today-FV
‘he went to the market with her today’
A phrase-final vowel cannot be added to a morpheme whose underlying form
ends in a vowel. This provides a tool for determining whether the final vowel of
the morpheme is underlying or not:
(7) Gwà tá lúmò kúm
kə́dàn tsoɓ keve-*e
G. go market yesterday PURP buy fish-*FV
for ‘Gwa went to the market yesterday to buy fish’ [keve ‘fish’]Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-338chapter 2A final vowel can be added after a glide, providing evidence that the glide is
an underlying consonant and not a part of a diphthong. The added vowel is a
copy of the vowel preceding the glide:
(8) mum ne ʒyè
ɗáw-a
3M give peanut one-FV
‘he gave (me) one peanut’ [ɗáw ‘one’]
(9) ta kə

Liquids: l, r
Pévé distinguishes between the lateral /l/ and the rhotic /r/, realized as a short
trill:
/l/
/r/làʔ ‘say’; lúmò ‘market’ (Ful.)
raʔ ‘gather (things)’; rìn 1SG possessive pronoun; rù 2M possessive pronoun; ri ‘time, space’2.11
Lateral Fricatives: ɬ, ɮ
The voiceless lateral fricative /ɬ/ contrasts with the voiced lateral fricative /ɮ/
and with the lateral liquid /l/. All three occur in word-initial position:
/ɬ/
/ɮ/
/l/ɬé ‘to take’; ɬew or ɬyew ‘meat’
ɮe ‘to start, to pass’; ɮaʔ ‘to dance’
làʔ ‘say’Both /l/ and /ɬ/ are attested in word-final position:
/ɬ/
/l/vaɬ ‘five’

vowel).
While oral vowels occur in open and closed syllables, nasalized vowels occur
only in open syllables or before a glottal stop. The lax vowels /ɪ, ɛ, ɔ, ʊ/ occurErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-339phonology

Oral Vowels
Evidence that the five oral vowels are phonemic is provided by minimal or nearminimal pairs in open syllables:
/i/

/e/
/a/
/o/
/u/ʃin ‘work’
ʃyèn ‘to sleep’

not appear in any instance to be phonemic, any lax vowels in transcriptions are
surface manifestations of underlying tense vowels.","[52, 53, 54, 55]"
"2Verbs of SayingSimple verbs of saying in Pévé include the verbs làʔ ‘to say, to tell’, in ‘to speak,

Frequently used compound verbs of saying, which consist of a verb followed by a noun, include© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020 | doi:10.1163/9789004410053_020Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3269complementationtʃi vun ‘to ask someone’ (lit. ‘ask mouth’), ɗám vun ‘to answer a question, to
reply to someone’ (lit. ‘answer mouth’), in dàn ‘to say something, to talk’ (lit.
‘say word’), and other verbs. This section focuses on the most commonly used
forms, including làʔ ‘to say, to tell’, in ‘to speak’, tsi vun ‘to ask’ and ɗám vun ‘to
answer’.
2.1
Marking the Addressee
The means of marking the addressee of a verb of saying depends on two factors: (a) whether the addressee is represented by a noun or by a pronoun, and
(b) whether the verb is a simple verb or a compound verb consisting of a verb
followed by a noun.
The pronominal addressee of a simple verb is marked in the same way as
an indirect object pronoun with the semantic role of beneficiary, recipient, or
malefactive (cf. chapter 7). As is the case in simple clauses involving an indirect
object, the choice of pronoun and the presence of the adposition ne depend on
the tense and aspect of the main clause. In a perfective clause with an inherent verb of saying, the pronominal addressee is marked by an object from the
perfective set, preceded by the adposition ne:
(1) na ín ne nù
1SG say ADP 2M.O
‘I spoke to you’
(2) ta ín ne nùm tə́
ʔyá yé
3F say ADP 3M.O 3F.SBJV leave PERM
‘she1 told him she2 should leave’
The nominal addressee, like the nominal indirect object in other types of predications (see chapters 6, 7), is marked by the associative preposition kə after the
adposition ne:
(3) mum láʔ ne kə́
brùk
na
mum gewa mbə̀
3M say ADP ASSC monitor lizard-FV I.PRO 3M come back
sədayʔ
two days later
‘He told Monitor Lizard he should come back in two days.’
The addressee of a compound verb is marked differently from the addressee
of a simple verb. The verbs tʃí vun ‘to ask’ and ɗam vun ‘to answer’ are compounds consisting of a verb followed by the noun vun ‘mouth’. The pronom-Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3270chapter 19inal addressee of the compound verb is marked by an inalienable possessive
pronoun rather than an object pronoun, probably because the nominal constituent of some compound verbs is a body-part noun. The possessive pronoun
immediately follows the noun:

mə̀ na tsú mi
3M answer 3M.POSS-FV REL 1SG NEG NEG
‘He answered him, “It wasn’t mine!”’
2.2
Coreferentiality vs. Non-coreferentiality
As shown in Frajzyngier 1996, some Chadic languages differentiate between
coreferentiality and non-coreferentiality (also called disjoint reference) with
respect to (a) the subject of the matrix clause and the subject of the complement clause, and (b) the addressee of the matrix clause and the subject of the
complement clause. Pévé has a grammatical means of indicating whether or
not the subject of the matrix clause is coreferential with the subject of the
complement clause. As shown below, this applies only when the complement
clause is in the subjunctive mood.
When the pronominal subject of the matrix clause and the pronominal subject of the indicative complement clause have the same values for person, gender, and number, the same pronoun form can be used to mark the subject in
both clauses. Coreferentiality or lack of coreferentiality with respect to the two
subject pronouns depends on context:
(6) mum láʔ i
mum dʒwa
3M said COMP 3M chief
‘he1 said that he1/2 is chief’
(7) tá ín í
tá kəí kávà sá-a
3M say COMP 3M break hoe 3F.POSS-FV
‘she1 said she1/2 broke her hoe’
There is also no means of marking coreferentiality or non-coreferentiality
when the subject of the matrix clause is a noun and the subject of the indicative
complement is a pronoun:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3271complementation(8) Kói ín í
múm gáo
n-a
K. say COMP 3M hunter I.PRO-FV
‘Koi said that he (Koi) is a hunter’ or ‘Koi said that he (someone else) is a
hunter’
While there is no overt means of coding coreferentiality of the two subjects
in the indicative mood, the subject of the complement clause can be omitted
when it shares the person, gender and number of the matrix clause subject.
When the subject of the complement clause is omitted, the assumption is that
the subject of the matrix clause and the subject of the complement clause refer
to the same entity:
(9) mùm láʔ i
na
(mùm) táʔ tu
rùm né
nàn
3SG say COMP I.PRO 3M
show body 3M PREP 1SG.O
si
ASSERT
‘He1 said that (he1) would show himself to me.’
When the complement clause is in the subjunctive mood, as defined in chapter 9, Pévé does make a distinction between coreferentiality and non-coreferentiality between the pronominal subject of the matrix clause and the pronominal subject of the complement. When the subject of the complement clause
shares the person, gender and number value of the subject of the matrix clause
but is not coreferential with the subject of the matrix clause, the subject of the
complement clause is marked by a subject pronoun from the subjunctive set
(see chapter 6):
(10) ta ín ne nùm tə́
ʔyá yé
3F say ADP 3M.O 3F.SBJV leave PERM
‘she1 told him she2 should/could leave’
(11) mum ín ne nùm nə
ʔyá yé
3M say ADP 3M.O 3M.SBJV leave PERM
‘he1 told him he2 should/could leave’
The subjunctive pronoun is also used when the subject of the matrix and the
subject of the complement do not share person, gender and number:
(12) mùm láʔ á
fàŋ mbə̀ tám kə́dàn ve
sə̀lày
3M say 1SG.SBJV return today PURP collect moneyErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3272chapter 19màn-a
1PL.POSS-FV
‘He said I should come back today to collect my money.’
The evidence that the subjunctive pronoun in the complement marks noncoreferentiality rather than the subjunctive nature of the complement is that
when the subject of the subjunctive complement clause is coreferential with
the subject of the matrix clause, the same pronoun form is used in both clauses.
In other words, when the subject of the matrix clause and the subject of the
complement clause have the same referent, the subjunctive mood of the complement clause cannot be marked by the choice of subject pronoun. This leaves
the clause-final particle, such as yé (permission, obligation), as the only means
of marking the subjunctive mood in the complement:
Coreferential subject (fem.):
(13) ta ín ne nùm ta ʔyá yé
3F say ADP 3M.O 3F leave PERM
‘she1 told him she1 could leave’
Coreferential subject (masc.):
(14) mum ín ne nùm mum ʔyá yé
3M say ADP 3M.O 3M leave PERM
‘he1 told him he1 could leave’
Coreferentiality of the subject of the complement and matrix clauses can be
emphasized by the use of a coreferential non-perfective object pronoun after
the subject of the complement:
(15) ta ín ne nùm ta sə ʔyá yé
3F say ADP 3M.O 3F 3F.O leave PERM
‘she1 told him she1 could leave’
(16) mum ín ne nùm mum um ʔyá yé
3M say ADP 3M.O 3M 3M.O leave PERM
‘he1 told him he1 could leave’
There appears to be no means of indicating the referential relationship
between the addressee of the matrix clause and the subject of the comple-Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3273complementationment clause. When the addressee and the subjunctive complement have the
same reference, the subject of the complement is marked by a pronoun from
the subjunctive set:
(17) hándày ín ne mbà mə́
ʔyá sí
3PL
say ADP 1PL 1PL.SBJV leave EE
‘they told us we should leave’
The subject of the complement is also marked by a pronoun from the subjunctive set when the addressee and the subjunctive complement do not have the
same reference:
(18) ə̀ŋ laʔ sə́ nə̀ mbə̀ ye
2F say 3F 3M come SUBJ
‘you (fem.) tell her that he should come’
When the complement is in the indicative mood there is no distinction
between the coreferentiality and lack of coreferentiality of the addressee and
the subject of the complement. This is also true of the subject of the complement (Gwà) and the possessor within the complement (‘his hoe’):
(19) Taú ín ne kə
Gwà i
mum ɗúm wa kávà ùmù
T. say ADP ASSC G. COMP 3M forget hoe 3M.POSS
‘Tau1 told Gwa2 that he (1,2) forgot his (1,2) hoe’
2.3
Complementizers and Verbs of Saying
In constructions consisting of a matrix clause followed by a complement, the
complement may or may not be preceded by a complementizer. Unlike in
some Chadic languages, such as Lele (East Chadic; Frajzyngier 2001), the presence or form of a complementizer following a verb of saying in Pévé does not
necessarily depend on whether the complement represents direct or indirect
speech.
Markers used in constructions involving a matrix-clause verb of saying
include the inherent complementizer i and the impersonal pronoun na (see
chapter 11). Use of an impersonal pronoun as a complementizer in Pévé is much
like the use of the English form ‘that’, which may function as either a pronoun
or a complementizer depending on position and context. The Pévé form na,
which may occur independently or may be preceded by the complementizer i,
functions as a complementizer with only a small set of verbs, including làʔ ‘to
say, to tell’, in ‘to speak, to tell’, and ɗìk ‘to believe’ (see section 4, below). TheErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3274chapter 19complementizer i is attested with verbs of cognition, perception, and volition
as well as with verbs of saying, as shown in later sections.
2.3.1
The Verb laʔ ‘to Say, to Tell’
In some natural discourse and elicited examples involving the verb làʔ with a
direct-speech complement, the complement (in brackets) is unmarked, i.e. not
preceded by a complementizer:
(20) mum láʔ ne nùm [ha láʔ
mbə̀ si
ha màn yè
3M say ADP 3M.O 2M COND come ASSERT 2M 1SG.O know

‘He said, “You took my tobacco yesterday.”’
(22) ta láʔ [wa rù
fól-ó]
3F say head 2M.POSS whitish-FV
‘He said, “Your head is whitish.”’
There are also natural discourse and elicited examples in which the directspeech complement of the verb láʔ is marked by the impersonal pronoun na,
evidence that the presence or absence of a complementizer does not mark the
difference between direct and indirect speech:
(23) yii
láʔ ne
nùm na
à
gewa

‘Squirrel said to him, “Go back!”’
Some indirect-speech complements are not marked by a complementizer,
while other indirect-speech complements are marked by na:

(26) na láʔ na

mbə̀ ye

‘I said that you could come’
In at least one instance in natural discourse, the forms i and na co-occur after
the matrix verb láʔ:
(27) mùm láʔ i
na
(mùm) táʔ tu
rùm né
nàn
3SG say COMP I.PRO 3M
show body 3M PREP 1SG.O

ASSERT
‘He said that (he) would show himself to me.’
In summary, the presence or absence of the markers (i) na after the matrix verb
láʔ is not determined by whether the complement represents direct or indirect
speech.
2.3.2
The Verb in ‘to Say, to Speak’
In natural discourse and in elicited examples involving the matrix verb in ‘to
speak, to say’, the direct-speech complement of in is sometimes marked by the
complementizer na:

3F say ADP 3M.O-FV 2M.SBJV buy clothing ADP 1SG.O NEG
‘she told him, “Do not buy me any clothing!” ’
The indirect-speech complement is sometimes marked by the complementizer i. The complement has the form of an independent clause regardless of
whether or not the main verb and complement share the same subject:
(30) Kói ín i
mum kəí kávà ùm-ù
K. say COMP 3M break hoe 3M.POSS-FV

There are also examples in which the indirect-speech complement of in is not
marked:
(32) handày ín ne mbà mə́
ʔyá só
sí
3PL
say ADP 1PL.O 1PL.SBJV leave village ASSERT
‘they told us we should leave the village’
With the matrix-clause verb ɗám vun ‘to answer’, the direct-speech complement is not marked by a complementizer. Recall that the addressee has the
form of a possessive pronoun:
(33) dzənàk

gwáʔ ɗám vun

‘Guinea Fowl then answered him, “It wasn’t mine!” ’
The direct-speech complement of the verb tʃi vun ‘to ask’ is also an independent
clause without a complementizer:

‘he asked me if I knew the Pévé language’
In summary, while the complementizer i after the matrix-clause verb corresponding to ‘ask’ or ‘answer’ appears to mark the difference between complements involving direct vs. indirect speech, this distinction is not marked in
complements of verbs corresponding to ‘say’, ‘tell’ and ‘speak’. Such complements may be marked by the complementizer i, the impersonal pronoun na,
or the combined complementizer i na, with no apparent functional difference.
It is likely that the presence or absence of a complementizer relies in part on
the speaker’s choice, much like the complementizer in English sentences such
as ‘He said (that) he broke his hoe’.
2.4
Domain de dicto vs. Domain de re
Some verbs of saying, including the simple verb ó ‘to request’ and the compound verb tʃi vun ‘to ask’, may be followed by either a complement belonging to
the domain de dicto or a complement belonging the domain de re. The domain
de dicto, as defined in Frajzyngier and Jasperson 1991, consists of complements
involving direct or indirect speech, while complements in the domain de re
refer to an element of reality, such as an object or a location. The distinguishing
characteristic of the domain de re is that the complement has the grammatical
role of object in the matrix clause. The de re complement, unlike the de dicto
complement, is thus a dependent clause:

(39) mum tʃí vun kwá mə̀ ni na ti
3M ask thing REL PRO 1SG eat
‘he asked what I ate’ (‘the thing that I ate’)
The complement of the verb ó ‘to request something’ may also belong to the
domain de re. The evidence is that the thing requested functions as the object
of the matrix clause:
(40) na ó mbì ɓá
rum-u
1SG ask water from (‘hand’) 3M.POSS-FV
‘I asked him for water’
A requested action can be a nominalized verb that serves as the object of the
matrix clause, i.e. belongs to the domain de re. The agent of the complement
clause is marked as the possessor of the nominalized verb:
(41) na ó káw ɓá
wə
hayʔ ndày-à
1SG ask help from (‘hand’) PREP PREP 3PL.POSS-FV
‘I asked them for help’ (lit. ‘I asked for help near them’)
Some attempts to elicit causative constructions produced constructions with
the verb ó followed by an independent clausal complement, i.e. a complement
in the de dicto domain (recall that Pévé has no dedicated construction corresponding to the causative construction):
(42) mum ó ndày ɗi

Tense and Aspect in the Complement Clause
The only tense or aspect contrast attested in the complement clause is between
the perfective aspect and the unmarked aspect. The perfective aspect is marked
in the complement, as it is in the independent clause, by high tone on the verb
and the absence of a tense/aspect marker:
(44) Taú ín ne kə

In complement clauses referring to an ongoing or unbounded event, only the
unmarked aspect is attested. There are no examples of the imperfective marker
wə́ in the complement:

Some natural discourse complement clauses with future time reference occur
without the future marker də̀, but the future marker can be added without a
change in meaning:

‘He told him, “If you come here, you (will) know me because my head is

The question is whether constructions like examples 48 and 49 result from
omission of a tense/aspect marker or whether they represent the unmarked
aspect, whose temporal function is deduced from surrounding discourse or
the shared understanding of speaker and hearer. The context of example 50,
combined with the S O V order of constituents in the complement (bolded),
suggests that the construction results from omission of a tense/aspect marker,
in this case the future marker. Recall that the order of elements in the independent future clause is S də̀ O V when the object is pronominal:
(50) mum də̀ sə́ tsoɓ síw-i
3M FUT 3F.O buy tomorrow-FV
‘he will buy it (fem.) tomorrow’
The absence of overt markers of non-perfective tense or aspect in the complement clause suggests that Pévé, like many Chadic languages, distinguishes
between pragmatically independent clauses and pragmatically dependent
clauses, where the two types of clauses code different sets of tense and aspect
distinctions using different sets of coding means (Frajzyngier with Shay 2002,
Frajzyngier and Johnston with Edwards 2005, Creissels 2008 and Bril 2010).
2.6
Mood in the Complement Clause
The subjunctive mood in the complement is coded by the use of a subject pronoun from the subjunctive set. This holds true for direct- and indirect-speech
complements:
(51) mə̀m láʔá
fãmbə tám kədàn vɛ
səle
màn-a
mum láʔ á
faŋ mbə̀ tám kə́dàn ve
sə̀lay màn-a
3M say 1SG.SBJV return today PURP collect money 1SG.POSS
‘He said I should come back today to collect my money.’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3281complementation(52) lum láʔ à
ʔà
fãye
lum láʔ à
à
faŋ
ye
lion say 2M.SBJV 2M.SBJV repeat PERM
‘Lion said, “Go back!”’
The subjunctive subject marker is used even if the nature of the matrix clause
indicates obligation or command, as in the following example:
(53) tá ták nùm í
nə̀
tsòɓ mbə̀ràw né sə́ mì
3F forbid 3M.O COMP 3M.SBJV buy clothing ADP 3F.O NEG
‘she forbade him from buying her clothing’
The subject is marked in the subjunctive complement even if the subject is also
overtly marked as the addressee in the main clause:
(54) handày ín ne mbà mə́
ʔyá só
sí
3PL
say ADP 1PL.O 1PL.SBJV leave village ASSERT
‘they told us we should leave the village’
(55) ə̀ŋ

mbə̀ ye
2F.SBJV say 3F.O 3F.SBJV come PERM
‘tell her to come!’ (‘(you) tell her1 she1 should come’)
2.7
Speech Topic as Complement
The complement of a verb of saying may represent the thing said or the topic
of speech. The noun dàn ‘word’ after the verb in refers to a fragment of speech,
which may or may not be specific:
(56) na ín dàn ne nù
1SG tell word ADP 2M.O
‘I told you something/I told you that’
(57) na ké
in dàn kə
rù
1SG PROG tell word ASSC 2M.POSS
‘I was saying something/that to you’
The phrase wa dàn ‘about’ (lit. ‘on word’) marks what follows as the topic of
speech:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3282chapter 19(58) na wàʔ kədàn in dàn wa dàn vari rə̀kway
1SG want PURP tell
about trip
‘I would like to talk about the trip.’
The form wa, corresponding to ‘about’, may occur without the noun dàn ‘word’
without an apparent change in meaning:
(59) swə mə̀ní ha ín
dan wa sa
nə
mbə́ sí
man REL 2M speak word about 3F.POSS DED.M come ASSERT
‘the man you spoke to about her has arrived’

3M ask
1SG.POSS about animal
REL PRO 1PL
wé na
see I.PRO
‘he asked me about the animal that we saw’
Attempts to elicit a nominalized verb as a complement of a verb of saying produced only complements in the form of independent clauses, preceded by the
complementizer i:
(61) handày ín né nàn í
á
ʔyá yé
3PL
say ADP 1SG.O COMP 1SG.SBJV leave PERM
‘they told me to leave’ (‘they told me I should leave’)
(62) tá ták

3F forbid 3M.O COMP 3M.SBJV buy clothing ADP 3F.O NEG
‘she told him not to buy her clothing’ (‘she told him that he (should) not
buy clothing for her’)3Verbs of PerceptionComplements of matrix verbs of perception distinguish between direct and
indirect perception. The recorded verbs of perception include mùn ‘to hear, to
understand’, we ‘to see, to know, to recognize’, and ye, a dialectal variant of we.
Indirect perception is coded by the complementizer i followed by an independent clause. Since there is no addressee, the complementizer i follows the
matrix-clause verb:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3complementation283(63) Taú wé i
tá ɗúm wa
kávà s-á
T. see COMP 3F forget (‘lose head’) hoe 3F.POSS-FV
‘Tau saw that she1,2 forgot her1,2 hoe’
(64) Taú mún i
tá ɗúm wa kávà s-á
T. hear COMP 3F forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
‘Tau heard that she1,2 forgot her1,2 hoes’
The complementizer i may be preceded by the phrase handày ín ‘they said’,
where the 3PL subject pronoun represents an unspecified speaker:
(65) Taú mún handày ín i
tá ɗúm wa kávà s-á
T. hear 3PL
say COMP 3F forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
‘Tau heard that she1 forgot her1 hoe’ (‘Tau heard them/someone say that
she forgot her hoe’)
Direct perception is coded by the object role of the complement clause in the
matrix clause, the same means used to code the de re domain with the verb tʃi
vun ‘to ask’. The complementizer i does not occur:
(66) na wé swə wə́
mbə̀ hayʔ mbà
1SG saw man IMPF enter PREP 1PL.POSS
‘I saw someone entering our place’
Evidence that the complement is the object of the matrix clause is provided by
the fact that the pronominal subject of the complement clause is represented
by an object pronoun:
(67) na wé sə́ ʔyá
wə́
dà
1SG see 3F.O depart IMPF go
‘I saw her leaving’
The subject of the complement clause may be represented as the possessor of
the thing heard:
(68) na mún syem tà ùm
wə́
mbà
1SG hear foot walk 3M.POSS IMPF come
‘I heard him coming’ (‘I heard his feet walking’)Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3284chapter 19(69) may mún dàn màn
si
M. heard word 1SG.POSS ASSERT
‘May heard/understood what I said’ (‘heard my words’)4Verbs of CognitionVerbs of cognition include we or ye ‘to recognize, to know’ (also ‘to see’, above),
ɗìk ‘to think, to believe’, and ɗúm wa ‘to forget’ (‘to lose head’). Complements of
these verbs code a distinction between indirect knowledge and direct knowledge. The latter is marked by the complement serving as the object of the
matrix clause.
The complement representing indirect knowledge is an independent clause
preceded by the complementizer i:
(70) mum wə́
ɗìk
i
mum gáo
3M IMPF believe COMP 3M hunter
‘he1 believes that he1,2 is a hunter’
(71) mum ɗík
i
mum gáo
3M believe COMP 3M hunter
‘he1 believed that he1,2 was a hunter’
In constructions involving the verb we as a cognitive verb, the matrix clause
is followed by the assertive marker sí, possibly to distinguish we as a cognitive
verb from we as a verb of perception:
(72) na wé
si
hə́ŋ ɗúm wa kávà màŋ-á
1SG know ASSERT 2F forget hoe 2F.POSS-FV
‘I know that you forgot your hoe’
(73) na wé
si
hí ɗúm wa kávà mì
1SG know ASSERT 2PL forget hoe 2PL.POSS
‘I know that you (PL) forgot your hoes’
Cf. we as a verb of perception, as indicated by the absence of si:
(74) na wé i
tá ɗúm wa kávà s-á
1SG see COMP 3F forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
‘I saw that she forgot her hoe’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3285complementationThe direct-knowledge complement of a cognitive verb belongs to the
domain de re, indicated by the fact that the nominalized verb of the complement functions as the object of the main clause:
(75) swə̀ nyé
ʒi gayʔ
si
swə nə
yé
ʒi gayʔ
si
man DED.M know play game-FV ASSERT
‘the man knew how to play gayʔ’
In the next example the compound verb ɮaʔ wa dàn (ɮáʔ+‘about’) corresponds
to ‘to realize’. It is possible that ɮaʔ and zaʔ ‘to find’ are derived from the same
source. In the next example, the event of the de re complement is represented
by a nominalized compound verb (ɗúm wa) that functions as the object of
the main clause. The agent of the complement clause, which may have its
own object, is indicated by a possessive pronoun modifying the nominalized
verb:
(76) sə̀ráy ɮáʔ
wa dàn ɗúm wa kávà s-á
S.
realize about forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
‘Səray realized that she forgot her hoe’ (‘she realized the forgetting of her
hoe’)
The complement of the compound verb ɗúm wa is marked for the domain de
re when the thing forgotten is an entity or place. The complement is a relative
clause whose head (bolded) is the item whose identity is in question. The relative clause functions as the object of the matrix clause:

1SG forget thing REL PRO 2M give 3M.O POST ASSERT
‘I forgot the things that you gave him’5Volitional Verb wàʔComplements of the verb wàʔ ‘to want’ distinguish between the domains
de dicto and de re, where the different-subject complement belongs to the
domain de dicto and the same-subject complement belongs to the domain de
re.
The different-subject complement is an independent clause preceded by the
complementizer i. The use of a subject pronoun, not an object pronoun, to code
the subject of the complement is evidence that the subject of the complement
does not play a grammatical role in the main clause:
(80) tá wə́
wàʔ i
handày ʔyá yé
3F IMPF want COMP 3PL.O leave PERM
‘she wants them to leave’
(81) handày wàʔ i
nambà ʔyá yé
3PL
want COMP 1PL.O leave PERM
‘they want us to leave’
An interesting feature of different-subject complements of the verb wàʔ is that
the 1PL or 3PL subject of the complement clause is marked by a pronoun from
the indicative/alienable possession set (see above), while all other subject pronouns used in different-subject complements are from the subjunctive set. The
complementizer i occurs with both types of complements, indicative and subjunctive:
(82) ha wàʔ i

‘what do you want me to do?’

The distribution of indicative vs. subjunctive pronouns in the complement
holds true in all aspects and also with the counterfactual marker kə̀zə́:
Subjunctive subject:
(85) nambà wàʔ í

ʔyá

Cf. the indicative subject:
(87) handày wáʔ kə̀zə́ í
nambà ʔyá yé
3PL
want CF COMP 1PL
leave PERM
‘they wanted us to leave’
The same-subject complement of the verb wàʔ has no subject marker. The verb
of the complement functions as the object of the matrix clause, marking the
clause as belonging to the domain de re. The complement may be followed by
the permission marker ye, which codes the subjunctive mood:
(88) tá wàʔ ʔyá (ye)
3F want leave PERM
‘she wants to leave’
(89) handày wàʔ ʔyá (ye)
3PL
want leave PERM
‘they want to leave’
The matrix verb wàʔ may be followed by the purpose marker kə́dàn, which also
codes purpose in non-volitional constructions. The only recorded instances
involve a same-subject complement without an overt subject marker, where
the subject of the complement is the object of the matrix clause:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3288chapter 19(90) na wàʔ [kə]dàn in dàn rə̀kway-a

ɓá
rum
ye

‘if you want to eat, ask him for food’6Ability Verb gàk ‘Can, Be Able’The speaker’s estimation of the ability of the subject to perform an action is
coded by the verb gàk ‘to be able’ followed by a verb denoting the action. The
same form with the same meaning is found in Mundang. The verb gàk resembles the future tense marker də̀ and the aspect marker wə́ and ké in that gàk
follows the subject and precedes the verb; the verb following gàk is in the
unmarked form; and other markers, including pronouns referring to the indirect object, may intervene between gàk and the main verb. The verb gàk thus
functions as an auxiliary rather than a matrix verb:
(92) mum làʔ
gé ndoʔ sin um
si
mum gàk pemãy
3M COND finish work 3M.POSS ASSERT 3M can rest
si
ASSERT
‘if he has finished his work, he can rest’
When the verbal complement describing the action to be performed has a
pronominal direct object, the order of elements is S gàk O V and the pronoun
representing the object is from the non-perfective set:
(93) na làʔ
mbə́ síi
na gàʔ əm zaʔ si
na làʔ
mbə́ si
na gàk ùm zàʔ si
1SG COND come ASSERT 1SG can 3M.O find ASSERT
‘If I came here, I could find him.’
Cf. the future-tense clause, where the object pronoun also occurs between
tense marker and verb:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3complementation289(94) ta də̀ nùm pum-u
3F FUT 3M.O hit-FV
‘she will hit him’
High tone on the verb gàk in the indicative clause indicates that the potential action was achieved. The verb following gák (gàk with high tone) is in the
unmarked form and the object pronoun is from the perfective set:
(95) na gák zaʔ nùm si
1SG can find 3M.O ASSERT
‘I was able to find him’
Although the construction involving gàk resembles constructions involving
tense and aspect markers, there are several important differences. One is the
fact that the verb gàk may carry the high tone coding perfective aspect, while
tense/aspect markers have fixed tone. Another is that gàk may function as a
main verb, as evidenced by the following complete clause:
(96) na tsú gák mì
1SG NEG can NEG
‘I was not able to/I could not’
The speaker’s estimation of the subject’s ability can also be coded by a serial
verb construction consisting of the verb záʔ ‘to find’ followed by another verb:

7chapter 19Counterfactual Matrix ClauseUnlike many Chadic and non-Chadic languages, Pévé has grammaticalized the
marker kə̀zə́, glossed ‘CF’ for ‘counterfactual’, as a means of indicating that
the subject’s belief or wish, as expressed in the matrix clause, was unrealized.
The precise function of kə̀zə́ depends on the choice of verb in the matrix
clause. With a verb of cognition, kə̀zə́ indicates that the belief of the matrixclause subject did not turn out to be true. The marker kə̀zə́ follows the matrix
verb. The evidence that kə̀zə́ is part of the matrix clause and not the complement is that kə̀zə́ can be followed by the complementizer i.
(98) sə̀ráy ɗík
kə̀zə́ i
tá ɗúm wa kávà s-á
S.
believe CF COMP 3F forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
‘S. thought that she forgot her hoe’ (she didn’t forget it)
Cf. the clause with the compound verb ɮáʔ wa dàn ‘realize’, where the subject’s
belief is borne out by events. Here, kə̀zə́ does not occur:
(99) sə̀ráy ɮáʔ wa dàn ɗúm wa kávà s-á
S.
realize
forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
‘S. realized that she forgot her hoe’
When it is not obvious whether the subject’s belief holds true or not, kə̀zə́ is not
used:
(100) mum ɗík
i
mum gáo
3M believe COMP 3M hunter
‘he1 believed that he (1,2) was a hunter’ (he may or may not be a hunter)
Use of kə̀zə́ with the volitional matrix verb wàʔ ‘want’ indicates that the subject’s desire was not met:
(101) handày wáʔ kə̀zə́ í
nambà ʔyá yé
3PL
want CF COMP 1PL
leave PERM
‘they wanted us to leave’ (we didn’t leave)
Without kə̀zə́, the subject’s desire may or may not have been met:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3291complementation(102) nambà wàʔ i
ì
ʔyá
1PL
want COMP 2PL.SBJV leave
‘we wanted you to leave’ (he may or may not have left)
As previously noted, the same-subject complement of the verb wàʔ functions
as the object of the matrix clause (domain de re). Evidence for the object role
of the nominalized verb is that it precedes the counterfactual marker:
(103) nambà wàʔ ʔyá kə̀zə́ yé
1PL
want leave CF PERM
‘we wanted to leave’ (but we couldn’t)
Cf. without the counterfactual marker:
(104) handày wàʔ yá yé
3PL
want leave PERM
‘they want to leave’
In a sentence involving the auxiliary verb gàk ‘to be able’ there is no matrix
clause. The marker kə̀zə́, which indicates that the act the speaker deemed possible did not occur, is attested in both clause-final and clause-initial position, a
characteristic of most adjuncts (see chapter 23):
(105) na gàk ùm zàʔ kə̀zə́ si
1SG can 3M.O find CF ASSERT
‘I should have been able to find him’
or
(106) kə̀zə́ na gàk ùm zàʔ si
CF 1SG can 3M.O find ASSERT
‘I should have been able to find him’
The evidence for the counterfactual function of kə̀zə́ is that the counterfactual matrix clause can be followed by a clause negating the potential event
described by the matrix clause:
(107) na gàk ùm zàʔ kə̀zə́ si
àmá na tsú gák mì
1SG can 3M.O find CF ASSERT but 1SG NEG can NEG
‘I should have been able to find him, but I couldn’t’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3292chapter 19The clause with kə̀zə́ cannot be followed by a clause stating that the event
took place:
(108) na gàk ùm zàʔ kə̀zə́ si
*ɓay na záʔ nùm si
1SG can 3M.O find CF ASSERT CONJ 1SG find 3M.O ASSERT
for ‘I should have been able to find him, and I found him’
Similarly, the clause without kə̀zə́ cannot be followed by a clause negating the
event:
(109) na gák záʔ nùm si
*àmá na tsú zaʔ nùm mì
1SG can find 3M.O ASSERT but 1SG NEG find 3M.O NEG
for ‘I could have found him, but I didn’t find him’
As shown in chapter 18, the marker kə̀zə́ may also occur in a conditional protasis clause, where it indicates that the condition described by the protasis was
not met.","[284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"

1IntroductionThe English-Pévé lexicon is based on English translations of Pévé lexical items and
morphemes. For morphemes for which there is no English equivalent, the English definition consists of a description of the grammatical category or grammatical function.
The abbreviations used in the grammar and in the Pévé-English lexicon are also used
below.","[348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360]"

6.1.2
Distal Spatial Deixis
The distal counterparts of the proximal demonstratives ti and ni are dáyʔ (fem.)
and náyʔ (masc., pl.). As is the case in proximal spatial deixis, the gender of the
demonstrative reflects that of the entity whose location is referred to:
(73) ya naw mə dáyʔ rə́
mə mum na
cow REL DIST.F POST REL 3SG.M I.PRO
‘that cow is his’ (lit. ‘the cow that is over there is his’)
Like the demonstratives ti and ni, dáyʔ and náyʔ can function as arguments in
verbless clauses of the form ‘who/what (is) DEM’:
(74) mi náyʔ
su
what DIST.M Q
‘what is that?’
(75) sa kuni náyʔ
su
who PL DIST.M Q
‘who are they?’
(76) ma
sa dáyʔ su
woman 3F DIST.F Q
‘who is that woman over there?’
In contrast with proximal deixis, where the feminine demonstrative is the
default form, it appears that the masculine demonstrative is the default form
for marking distal spatial deixis. The following sentence from natural discourse
answers a question about arithmetic, which has no inherent gender:
(77) náyʔ
gí
gu kánki wá ɗáw … wá hóɓ sar ye

‘That makes about sixty-one … two or so.’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3224chapter 126.2
Entity Deixis
The spatial deictic demonstratives ti, ni, dáyʔ, and náyʔ also function as determiners in the domain of entity deixis. In this function, the determiner indicates
whether a noun refers to an entity near to or distant from the place of speech.
Like the spatial deictic demonstratives in section 6.1, the deictic determiners
distinguish between proximal and distal deixis. Again, the default gender for
proximal deixis appears to be feminine. In the following example, the form ti
(fem.) indicates that the preceding noun dapà gaʔ ‘(river) bank’ refers to an
entity that is near the place of speech, while the form dáyʔ (fem.) indicates
that the entity represented by dapà gaʔ is distant from the place of speech:
(78) mota

‘Cars filled the (river) bank on this side and also on the other side.’
The form ni, when used as a determiner, refers to a masculine entity near the
place of speech:
(79) swə ni

man PROX.M PRO hit 3SG-FV
‘this man, he hit him’
The form náyʔ as a determiner refers to a masculine entity that is distant from
the place of speech:
(80) ndáʔ
náyʔ

horse (m.) DIST.M black-FV
‘that horse is black’
The distal form náyʔ, like the proximal form ni, can refer to a plural entity of
unspecified gender:

Temporal Deixis
The masculine proximal marker ni can also be used to mark the proximity of
a point in time with respect to the time of speech. In phrase-final position the
marker ni is followed by na, whose function is to mark the end of a verbless
clause (see chapter 11):
(82) ì
də ɗe num kə
fə̀tà ni
na
2PL.SBJV FUT call 3M.O ASSC day PROX I.PRO
‘you will call him this afternoon’ (lit. ‘with the afternoon that is here’)7ConclusionThe rich system of reference in Pévé includes the first mention of an entity,
as indicated by use of a bare noun phrase; feminine, masculine, and plural
determiners that instruct the listener to deduce the referent of the noun using
any available means; and various means of narrowing the scope of reference,
including anaphoric reference to an entity, a location, a point in time, an event,
or the manner of a preceding or ongoing event; previous mention; and proximal vs. distal deictic reference to an entity, location, or point in time. In all
domains apart from first mention, plurality of the head noun is marked by the
phrase-final marker kunə. The plural marker cannot be used in first mention of
an entity. Some forms in the domain of reference have an interesting interaction with other domains. For example, because the default marker of proximal
location is the feminine determiner ti, use of the masculine demonstrative ni
in referring to a proximal location places the location in focus. Similarly, a previously mentioned inanimate entity is usually not overtly marked, so the use of
an overt noun or pronoun to refer to a previously mentioned inanimate entity
places the referent in focus.","[237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"
"2Existing ApproachesThe alternation between a given morpheme with a final vowel and the same
morpheme without a final vowel has been subject to a variety of analyses in
Chadic linguistic literature. Most analyses (Barreteau and Le Bléis 1990, Newman 2000, Frajzyngier with Shay 2002, Newman and Vanheuven 1981, and others) view the contrast as being between a prepausal form, which has a final
vowel (in some cases a long vowel), and a non-prepausal or sentence-internal
form, which does not have a final vowel. In most such studies it is assumed
that the final vowel is underlying and that it is deleted in non-prepausal position.
Analyses based on the prepausal/non-prepausal contrast do not account for
contrasts of the type found in Pévé. In both of the following sentences the firstperson singular pronoun is phrase-final, yet one form has a final vowel and one© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020 | doi:10.1163/9789004410053_004Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3parsing morphology55does not. Either form can be followed by a pause. Phrase-internal vowel deletion cannot be a factor, as the isolated 1SG pronoun has the form nàn rather
than *nàna:
(1) ta gí
kwáti ne nàn-a
3F make food ADP 1SG.O-FV
‘she made me some food’ (FV: final vowel)
vs.
(2) ta gí
kwáti ne nàn
3F make food ADP 1SG.O
‘she made me some food’
The question, therefore, is why a given morpheme has a final vowel in certain
utterances and not in others. As shown below, the distinction in Pévé between
the vowel-final form and the form without a final vowel occurs with lexical and
grammatical morphemes of many different categories.
In Pévé, the contrast between the phrase-final added vowel and the absence
of an added vowel resembles, to some extent, the contrast between final vowel
addition and final vowel deletion in Wandala (Central Chadic). Frajzyngier
2016b describes the function of the two forms in Wandala, termed ‘parsing morphology’, as follows:
While neither of the forms indicates any specific semantic relation, they
both enable the listener to parse the sentence into units that can undergo
further analysis and allow for inferences about a large number of semantic relations within the clause and within the sentence.
Frajzyngier 2016b: 1While the concept of parsing morphology broadly applies to the alternation
between phrase-internal and phrase-final forms in Pévé, the function of parsing morphology in Pévé differs from the forms and functions in Wandala, as
shown below. The following sections describe the form and distribution of
phrase-final vowels in Pévé and the functions of phrase-internal and phrasefinal forms.","[70, 71]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3the pévé language196.12
Negation
Negation in Pévé is unusual in two respects, namely dual marking of negation
and the scope of negation. Negation of the indicative clause is marked by the
negative marker tsú immediately after the subject noun or pronoun and the
negative marker mì at the end of the clause. The marker tsú can be omitted
only if the negative clause is a response to a question.
An interesting feature of Pévé is that whether or not tsú occurs, the scope
of the negative clause is the entire proposition. Attempts to elicit interrogative
sentences in which only one constituent is negated, e.g. the equivalent of ‘he
bought a cow, not a goat’, resulted in two separate clauses, one affirmative and
one negative: ‘he bought a cow; he did not buy a goat’. Unlike in some Chadic
languages, the coding of tense and aspect in the negative clause in Pévé is the
same as that in the affirmative clause.
6.13
Topicalization
In Pévé, a topicalized constituent is clause-initial and plays a grammatical role
in the comment clause. A topicalized non-subject constituent is one of the few
constituents that can precede the subject. The grammatical role of the topicalized constituent may be marked by a resumptive pronoun within the comment
clause or may be deduced from the presence or absence of other constituents in
the clause. Consistent with the absence of overt coding of the inanimate object
in other constructions (see above), the topicalized inanimate direct object does
not have to be marked within the comment clause.
Because the subject is clause-initial in the neutral clause (a clause without
a topicalized constituent), there must be additional means for coding the topicalized subject. The topicalized subject of a verbal clause is preceded by the
relative marker mə and followed by one of the resumptive pronouns nə (fem.),
rə (masc.) or kunə (pl.). The subject role of the topicalized subject constituent
is coded by a resumptive pronoun within the comment clause.
6.14
Focus
The domain of focus in Pévé includes contrastive and non-contrastive focus. In
the contrastive focus construction, the focused constituent, such as a certain
noun or verb, is implicitly compared with another constituent that could have
been used in the construction but was not used, due to the speaker’s choice.
In the non-contrastive focus construction, the focused element is marked as
being more important or salient than other elements that actually occur in
the construction. In Pévé, both functions are coded by the same means. These
means include the impersonal pronoun na after the focused element; the associative preposition kə after the focused element, followed by the relative markerErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-320chapter 1mə and a resumptive pronoun coding gender or plurality of the focused constituent; and the overt marking of a constituent that is normally understood,
and therefore not overtly marked, when it occurs in the non-focus construction.
6.15
Conjoined Clauses
Pévé has several means of conjoining clauses, including the presence of a coordinating conjunction and coordination through omission of a subject marker.
Unlike many Chadic languages, Pévé has a dedicated coordinating conjunction
ɓay, corresponding to ‘and’, which conjoins clauses that involve shared participants or events. Unlike coordinating conjunctions in many Indo-European and
other languages, ɓay does not function also as a nominal conjunction. The conjunction àmá ‘but’, an Arabic borrowing that is common in Chadic languages,
indicates that the event of the second clause is unexpected.
6.16
Relative Clauses
A relative clause is defined here as a clause that modifies a head noun. The
means of marking the relative clause depends on the grammatical role of the
head noun within the sentence. If the head of the relative clause functions as
subject or object, the head noun is followed by the relative marker mə, in turn
followed by a proximal deictic determiner ti (fem.) or ni (masc., pl.) corresponding to the head of the clause. If the relative clause with the subject or object
head is followed by other material in the same utterance, the end of the relative clause is usually marked by a deducible-reference marker from the set rə
(fem.), nə (ms.).
The non-subject/non-object head of a relative clause is followed by the
associative preposition kə and does not involve the relative marker mə. The
non-subject/non-object relative clauses is followed by a deducible-reference
marker regardless of whether or not the relative clause is the end of the utterance.
6.17
Conditional and Temporal Constructions
Conditional and temporal sentences in Pévé share the same basic structure:
Protasis + Apodosis. In both types of sentences the protasis clause sets the
condition or the time frame for the apodosis clause. However, the grammatical
markers that mark the two types of constructions are very different. The conditional protasis clause is marked by the morpheme làʔ ‘if’ (probably derived
from the verb làʔ ‘say’) after the subject and is followed by the phrase-final
assertive marker si. The temporal protasis can be marked by one of a number of temporal expressions. Distinctions coded in temporal protasis clausesErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3the pévé language21include completion of the event before the apodosis, ongoing nature of the
event before or during the apodosis, and an event that took place or will take
place at a specific point in time. The temporal protasis may or may not be
followed by the assertive marker si. There is no dedicated marker of the conditional or temporal apodosis clause, which has the form of an independent
clause.
6.18
Complementation
A complement clause, which usually follows the matrix clause, may function
as an argument of the verb or as a modifier of the verb. Clausal complements,
usually introduced by the complementizer í, occur with verbs of saying, cognition, perception, and volition, as well verbs corresponding to ‘be able’, ‘start’,
‘finish’, ‘spend the day/night’, ‘help’, and ‘make’.
Complements of some, but not all, verbs of saying distinguish between
direct and indirect speech. It appears that predications involving the most commonly used verbs of saying are the least likely to differentiate between direct
and indirect speech complements. Complements of verbs of cognition and perception distinguish between direct and indirect cognition or perception. Pévé
also marks a distinction between complements in the realm of the real world
(de re complements) and complements in the domain of speaking (de dicto
complements) (cf. Frajzynger and Jasperson 1991, Frajzyngier and Shay 2003).
The coding means for the domain de dicto overlap with the means of coding
indirect perception.
As shown above, Pévé has grammaticalized the counterfactual function,
which indicates that the speaker’s desire or belief was not or cannot be realized. The counterfactual marker kə̀zə́ may occur at the end of a matrix clause,
followed by a complement marked by the complementizer i.
6.19
Comparative Constructions
Comparative constructions compare the properties or actions of one argument
(the target) with those of another argument (the basis). The property or action
involved is referred to as the standard of comparison. Coding means in comparative constructions include the comparative marker ndə́ ‘like’, which indicates equal comparison, and the verb pã ‘exceed, surpass’, which indicates that
the target exceeds the basis. When the basis exceeds the target, comparison is
marked by a negative clause involving the verb dày ‘to reach, to arrive’ and the
clause-final negative marker mí. Grammaticalization of the verb dày ‘reach’ as
a marker of comparison is unusual in Chadic languages.","[34, 35, 36, 37]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3244chapter 153.1
Focus on the Subject
Focus on the subject is marked by the marker kə followed by the relative marker
mə and a resumptive pronoun coding the gender of the head. The difference
between the focus clause and the relative clause lies in the marker kə́ after the
focused subject. The source of the marker kə́ is an open question, as the form
bears similarity to both the copula kè and the associative preposition kə:
(10) mum kə́ mə̀ ni tsóɓ ya nãw àmá na tsú mì
3M FOC REL PRO buy cow but 1SG NEG NEG
‘it’s he who bought the cow, not I’
(11) mum kə́ mə̀ ni bay màn-a
3M FOC REL PRO friend 1SG.POSS-FV
‘it is he who is my friend’
Compare with the relative clause, where the head is not followed by kə:

bay
man REL PRO take 1SG.O come here ASSC OP POST friend

3.2
Focus on the Object
As shown in chapter 6, a previously mentioned inanimate object is usually not
overtly marked. When an object pronoun is used to refer an inanimate argument, this places the argument in focus:
(14) na ti sə́/nùm
kúm-ú
1SG ate 3F.O/3M.O yesterday-FV

‘he is buying it for me’
Cf. the non-focused form, where the direct object is unmarked:
(16) na tsóɓ
kúm(-ú)
1SG bought yesterday
‘I bought (it) yesterday’
In some examples focus on the object is coded by the juxtaposition of an affirmative and a negative clause pertaining to the same event, where each clause
has a different overt object. The following sentence is a Pévé translation of the
English form ‘he bought a cow, not a goat’:
(17) mum tsóɓ ya nãw (pause) mum tsú tsóɓ ya hu mí
3M buy cow
3M NEG buy fem. goat NEG
‘he bought a cow; he did not buy a female goat’
3.3
Focus on the Adjunct
In the next three examples, focus on the temporal adjunct (see chapter 21) is
marked by the clause-final impersonal pronoun na, which indicates that the
adjunct is an independent equational clause (cf. chapter 11). The marker ni
codes proximity to the time of speech. The English translation is intended to
convey the meaning, though it may not reflect the order of constituents in Pévé:
(18) mgbaŋ ni

bə̀kà
T. go market ASSC morning
‘Tau went to the market this morning’4ConclusionA non-subject constituent is topicalized by fronting. The role of the topicalized constituent as the inanimate direct object of the comment clause is not
overtly marked within the clause. When the fronted non-subject argument is
not the direct object of the comment clause, the argument is marked by the
phrase dàn Noun DED, where DED is a deducible reference marker indicating
the gender of the head (i.e. topicalized) noun. The topicalized subject of a verbal clause may be marked as the head of a relative clause, with the grammatical
role of the topicalized subject indicated by a resumptive pronoun within the
comment clause. Another means of indicating topicalization is a pause after
the topicalized constituent.
Pévé does not distinguish between contrastive and non-contrastive focus.
Means of coding focus include the preposition kə followed by the relative
marker mə and a resumptive pronoun referring to the focused constituent;
overt marking of a constituent that is normally understood, such as the previously mentioned inanimate direct object; and the impersonal pronoun na,
which places the constituent in focus by marking it as an independent clause.","[259, 260, 261, 262]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3162chapter 92.1.2
Direct and Indirect Object
Direct and indirect object pronouns used in a subjunctive clause are from the
perfective object pronoun set (see section 1, above, and also chapter 6):
(14) à
pum nùm ye
2M.SBJV hit 3M.O PERM
‘hit him!’
(15) à
ne nàn riʔ-i
2M.SBJV give 1SG.O already-FV
‘you should/may give it to me’ (request, permission)
Cf. the same pronouns in the indicative perfective clause:

man/person hit 3M.O-FV
‘someone hit him’
(17) mum ne nùm ne nàn-a
3M give 3M.O ADP 1SG.O-FV
‘he gave it to me’
The verb of the subjunctive clause may be followed by an object pronoun from
the perfective-subjunctive object set that reflects the person and number of
the addressee, resulting in dual reference to the subject. Use of a coreferential object pronoun in a subjunctive construction involving only one entity,
the addressee, conveys the speaker’s belief that the addressee will be indirectly
affected by the command or wish expressed by the speaker. This function is
similar to that of ‘self’ in English constructions such as ‘get yourself over here!’
or ‘have yourself a sandwich!’:

2.2
Clause-Final Particles in the Subjunctive Mood
In nearly all elicited and natural discourse examples, a clause in the subjunctive
mood has a clause-initial or clause-final particle that conveys urgency, obligation, permission, or politeness from the speaker’s perspective. The attested
particles include riʔ, ye, say, and mì, whose forms and functions are described
in the following sections. English translations are not word for word but are
intended to capture the different functions of the particles.
2.2.1
Addressee’s Obligation: riʔ
The clause-final particle riʔ, when used in the subjunctive mood, conveys obligation or urgency on the part of the addressee. For reasons discussed below,
the particle is glossed as ‘already’:
(23) ì
mbə̀ riʔ-i
2PL come already-FV
‘come here!’ (used in an emergency, when the speaker needs help)
(24) à
ne nàn riʔ-i
2M.SBJV give 1SG.O already-FV
‘give [it] to me’/‘you must give [it] to me!’
(25) à
kar riʔ
bay
2M.SBJV look already friend
‘“Look, friend!’” (‘you must look!’)Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3164chapter 9Compare a clause with the particle ye, glossed ‘PERM’ for ‘permission’, which
conveys a suggestion or a granting of permission (recall that i is the more formal
version of the 2M subjunctive pronoun):
(26) i
mbə̀ ye
2M.SBJV come PERM
‘come on over!’ or ‘you may come over’
Use of the particle riʔ is not limited to the subjunctive mood. When used in
the indicative mood, the particle riʔ marks an event as having been completed
in the unspecified past. The evidence that riʔ is not an aspectual marker is
that it can be used with other markers of aspect. In the next example, where
high tone on the verb marks the perfective aspect, the particle riʔ is necessary to show that the event of the first clause was completed prior to the
event of the second clause. The assertive marker si (see section 3.2, below) is
optional:
(27) mum ndé ʃyèn (si)
riʔ
ɓay mum ti kwá ɓo
3M fall sleep ASSERT already CONJ 3M eat thing PROM
‘he slept first (‘already’), and then he ate’
In the next example, which is marked for progressive aspect, riʔ indicates that
the event was completed at some point in the past:
(28) Gwà ké
suk wə
Mayo-Lope riʔ-i
G. PROG stay PREP M.-L.
already-FV
‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope’
The use of the particle riʔ in both indicative clauses and commands addressed
to the second person resembles functions of the adverb ‘already’ in English,
as in the indicative ‘he left already’ and the imperative ‘leave already!’ Similar
functions are posited for French déjà and Italian già in Hansen and Strudsholm
2008.
2.2.2
Speaker’s Obligation: sáyʔ
The clause-initial particle sáyʔ codes the speaker’s sense of his or her own
obligation. The first-person subject can be represented by a pronoun from the
indicative or the subjunctive set:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3165mood and modality(29) sáyʔ á
tà

də̀ mbə̀ kətáʔ si sáyʔ na gíláʔ tú
3M COND FUT come now REL OBLIG 1SG ready body
rìn-ì
1SG.POSS-FV
‘if he comes, I must be ready’
A second-person command with a negative consequence for the hearer may be
followed by the clause-final particle riʔ:
(31) à
mbə̀ riʔ-i
2M.SBJV come already-FV
‘come here (so I can punish you)!’ (cf. ‘get over here already!’ in English)
2.2.3
Permission: ye
The particle ye, like the particle riʔ, occurs only in phrase-final position. The
two particles cannot co-occur in the same clause. The particle ye is glossed
‘PERM’ for ‘permission’. With a second-person subject, ye conveys the speaker’s
permission to perform an act and can also be interpreted as a polite or formal
command:
(32) à
zye ye
2M.SBJV enter PERM
‘go on in/it’s okay to go in!’
(33) à
pum nùm ye
2M.SBJV hit 3M.O PERM
‘hit him!’ or ‘you may hit him’
(34) à
ve ye
2M.SBJV take PERM
‘take [it]/go ahead and take [it]!’
(35) pum ye
hit PERM
‘(you) could hit him’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3166chapter 9Compare with the marker riʔ, which conveys obligation but not permission:
(36) pum riʔ-i
hit already-FV
‘hit him first!’
(37) pum nùm riʔ-i
ɓay kaw nùm ɓo
hit 3M.O already-FV CONJ catch 3M.O PROM
‘hit him and then catch him!’
Clauses ending in ye are not limited to the second-person addressee. Use of
ye with a first-person plural subject indicates the speaker’s suggestion or the
speaker’s desire, both of which imply the speaker’s sense of permission:
(38) mə́ tà ye
1PL go PERM
‘let’s walk’
In a clause with a third-person subject, the marker yé conveys the speaker’s
permission, wishes or suggestions with respect to the subject:
(39) nə̀ mbə̀ yé
3M come PERM
‘may he come/let him come’
(40) nə̀/tə̀ ʔyá yé
3M/3F leave PERM
‘he/she should leave’
The marker ye can occur in an interrogative clause, where it marks a request
for permission or a question about obligation. Note the use of the subjunctive
subject pronoun as well:
(41) á
ɬe ɗérwa ye
su
1SG.SBJV take book PERM Q
‘may I borrow this (book)?’
(42) á
tà ye
su
1SG.SBJV walk PERM Q
‘may I walk?’ or ‘should I walk?’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3167mood and modalityThe marker ye is also attested in the non-subjunctive complement of the
verb wàʔ ‘to want’ (see chapter 19 for complements of volitional verbs):
(43) na wàʔ ʔyá ye
1SG want leave PERM
‘I would like to leave’
2.2.4
Prohibitive: mì
A prohibitive clause, the negative counterpart of the imperative or subjunctive
clause, is marked by the clause-final negative marker mì. While most indicative negative clauses involve two negative markers, the clause-final mì and the
clause-internal negative tsú (see chapter 14), the prohibitive clause does not
involve the clause-internal marker tsú. Pronouns used in the prohibitive clause
are from the same set as those used in the subjunctive or imperative clause (see
Table 12, above):
(44) à
də̀ han mì
2M.SBJV go there NEG
‘don’t go there!’
(45) à

2M.SBJV buy clothing give 1SG.O one NEG
‘don’t buy me any clothing’
(46) nə ʔyá mì
3M leave NEG
‘may he not leave/don’t let him leave’
The markers ye (permission), riʔ (obligation) or sáyʔ (speaker’s obligation) cannot be used in the prohibitive clause. This provides evidence that permission,
obligation, and prohibition are all subdomains within the domain of the subjunctive mood:

3chapter 9Epistemic MoodMarkers of the subjunctive mood and its subdomains contrast with markers
of the epistemic mood, which pertain to the speaker’s degree of belief in the
truth or likelihood of an event. The speaker’s attitude toward the truth of a
statement or the likelihood of a state or event can be expressed by a number of means, including verbs of saying, verbs of volition, verbs of cognition,
and conditional constructions, all of which are discussed in other chapters.
The discussion here is limited to the clause-final particle ɓo, which codes the
speaker’s reassurance or promise that an event will occur (promise mood), and
the clause-final particle si, which advises the hearer to believe in the occurrence of a past, current or future event or state (assertive mood). The evidence
that ɓo and si are both markers of mood is that they cannot co-occur with each
other or with any other markers of mood. The evidence that ɓo and si belong to
a modal domain distinct from that of the subjunctive mood is that all attested
clauses with ɓo or si involve subjects from the indicative set, not the subjunctive set.
3.1
Speaker’s Promise: ɓo
The particle ɓo, glossed ‘PROM’ for ‘promise’, has the same distribution as the
particles ye and riʔ, discussed above: It occurs in clause-final position and cannot occur in the same clause with another marker of mood.
The marker ɓo in a clause marked for the future tense codes the speaker’s
promise that the event will occur. With a first-person subject, the marker ɓo
indicates a promise on the part of the speaker:
(48) na də̀ tsoɓ ʒyè
wũ ne ɓo
1SG FUT buy peanuts 2M.O ADP PROM
‘I will certainly buy you some peanuts.’
The sentence is complete without ɓo but does not convey the same degree of
certainty:
(49) na də̀ tsoɓ ʒyè
wũ ne
1SG FUT buy peanuts 2M.O ADP
‘I will buy you some peanuts’
The fact that the particle ɓo can be used in conjunction with the future tense
to code the speaker’s hope or promise with respect to a future event suggests
that the future tense form alone does not convey the speaker’s belief that theErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3mood and modality169event will take place. Evidence that ɓo codes certainty regarding a future event
is that the future tense marker də̀ can be omitted if ɓo is present:
(50) na tsoɓ ʒyè
wũ ne ɓo
1SG buy peanuts 2M.O ADP PROM
‘I (will) definitely buy you some peanuts’
In a simple clause with a non-first person subject, ɓo conveys the speaker’s hope
or belief that the event will occur:
(51) mum (də̀) màn ne sə̀lay ɓo
3M FUT 1SG.O ADP money PROM
‘I hope/believe he (will) give me the money’
Use of the particle ɓo in a negative clause indicates that the event has not yet
occurred, though the speaker believes that it will occur:
(52) mum tsu màn ne sə̀lay ɓo
3M NEG 1SG.O ADP money PROM
‘he has not yet given me the money (but he will)’
The particle ɓo occurs in the proper name koi suk ɓo ‘Koi will survive’ (‘Koi live
PROM’) and in the following exchange of salutations:
Greeting:
(53) heɓ su
peace Q
‘hello’ (‘at peace’)
Response:
(54) heɓ ɓo
peace PROM
‘hello’ (‘peace is promised’)
3.2
Assertive Marker si
The assertive marker si occurs very frequently in natural discourse, folktales,
and elicited examples. The following sections describe the form, distribution,
and function of the marker.","[177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185]"
"2Temporal AdjunctsPévé has a rich set of temporal nouns and noun phrases, some of which are

The
phrase kə fə̀tà (ASSC ‘sun’) is also used to refer to the dry season. Adding a deictic noun or deictic determiner makes the temporal reference deictic, as in tám

(6) tám tà gí tsoɓ mbìr tʃẽt-ẽ

milk all-FV
‘today she sold all the milk’
As is the case in many languages, the adverbials kum ‘yesterday’ and tám ‘today’
may code broad reference to the past and the present, respectively. In the next
example the adjunct zaʔ ‘still’ (also ‘plus’, as in wãy zaʔ kum, above), combined
with negation, emphasizes the fact that the state does not obtain at the present
time:
(7) ta ké

‘she used to be pretty, but she isn’t pretty anymore’ (note the use of kum

coding duration of the event:

Reference to time on a clock is coded by the associative preposition kə followed
by the phrase ndʒike (‘iron’) + Numeral. The term ‘iron’ goes back to to the
metal watches introduced decades ago by Europeans. The distinction between
morning and evening is coded by the marker mə followed by a temporal noun
or noun phrase: mə rìyà ‘afternoon’, mə (vun) bə̀kà ‘morning’ (‘mouth of the
day/morning’) or mə (gaʔ) bə̀kà (‘side of the day/morning’).
The point in time when the event occurred is marked by the associative

time the event ends:

The marker gwáʔ ‘then’ marks an event that follows another event. Unlike most
adverbials, gwáʔ occurs between the subject and the verb. This is a feature that
gwáʔ shares with the conditional marker làʔ (cf. chapter 18), the future tense
marker də̀, the aspect markers wə́ (IMPF) and ké (progressive aspect), and the
auxiliary gàk ‘to be able’. Since làʔ and də̀ are clearly derived from verbs (làʔ
‘to say’, də̀ ‘to go’), it is likely that gwáʔ ‘then’ and other preverbal markers are
also of verbal origin. The following examples show the use of gwáʔ in natural
discourse:

‘insufficient, incomplete’:

2M make work stay PROM
‘your work is insufficient/incomplete’3Associative and Instrumental AdjunctsAs shown in chapter 5, the associative preposition kə may conjoin two nouns
within a single noun phrase. When the noun marked by the associative preposition follows the verb, the noun functions as an adjunct:
(21) Taú tá lúmò kə
Gwà
T. go marker ASSC G.
‘Tau went to the market with Gwa’
Cf. the conjoined noun phrase:
(22) Taú kə
Gwà tá lúmò

‘Tau and Gwa went to the market’
The pronominal object of the associative preposition is from the set that codes
inalienable possession:
(23) ha də̀ Pala kə
ndày(-a)
2M FUT P. ASSC 3PL.POSS(-FV)
‘you will go to Pala with them.’
The function opposite to that of the associative adjunct is coded by dan ‘without’:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3306chapter 21(24) mum tá lúmò dan

ndʒì
3PL
come PURP 3PL
help (‘take hand’) RECIP
‘they came to help each other’
The preposition wa ‘on’ followed by the reciprocal ndʒì codes a similar function.
The preposition wa is probably derived from the noun ‘head’, used in other constructions as a spatial preposition (chapter 10):
(26) nambà mbə́ gí sin wa
ndʒì

has no subject, though it may have an object:

T. ASSC G. PL go market separately-FV
‘Tau and Gwa went to the market separately.’4Manner AdjunctsThe clause-final marker go ~ gwa, perhaps derived from the temporal adverbial
gwáʔ (see section 2, above), softens a command addressed to the hearer. The
marker go, with the underlying form gwáʔ, is glossed as ‘now’, as its function is
curiously similar to that of the English consolatory forms ‘now, now’ and ‘there,
there’:

The marker go/gwa does not belong to the domain of modality, as gwa can
co-occur with the subjunctive marker riʔ, which codes the addressee’s obligation:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3308chapter 21(36) á

narrows the scope of the state described in the construction:
(38) mum ɗáw sar-a

‘he is alone’ (lit. ‘he is just one’)

‘he just buys only yours’5Intensity, Repetition, and RecurrenceThis section describes adjuncts coding repetition, recurrence, or intensity of an
event. Some adjuncts are single lexical items, some are derived through duplication, and others are prepositional phrases.
As shown in chapter 5, reduplication of the verb conveys some meanings
that are conveyed by adverbs in many other languages, such as intensity or repetition of the event:
(45) tʃiʔ vay wə́

Intensity can also be conveyed by the clause-final modifier ɓáyrúm ‘very, much’.

"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3phonology41The added vowel following a nasal consonant may be [+nasal], even if the
preceding vowel is [-nasal]:
(10) ta tá lúmò kə

3F go market ASSC 3M.O-FV

While it is likely that most or all nasalized vowels have their origins in the properties of adjacent underlying or surface consonants, lists like the one above
show that nasalized vowels are contrastive and so must be considered to be
phonemic.
3.3
Diphthongs
A few diphthongs are attested, mostly in proper names, e.g., Taú and Koi, and
in the verb kəi ~ kəy ‘to break’. The evidence that /aú/ in Taú is a sequence of
vowels rather than the sequence Vowel+Glide is provided by the fact that a final
vowel cannot be added in phrase-final position:
(11) mum ɬé nãw Taú-*u
3M take bovine T.-*FV
‘he took Tau’s cow’
Compare with the sequence Vowel+ Glide, where a phrase-final vowel can be
added:
(12) Taú tá ráʔ

T. walk gather bovine-FV
‘Tau gathered cattle’
3.4
Vocalization of the Palatal Glide
The Vowel+Glide sequence /ay/ becomes the diphthong /ai/ when followed by
a glottal stop. The evidence for vocalization is that the phrase-final added vowel
(see chapter 3) is /i/, not /a/. Retention of the sequence yʔ-á is not acceptable:

Vowel Epenthesis and Vowel Reduction
3.5.1
Vowel Epenthesis
The epenthetic vowel /ə/ is often deployed when a morpheme or syllable whose
underlying form is a single consonant is followed by another consonant. Underlying forms are in the second line in the next two examples:
(14) nambà ʔyá ti
kə
ndʒìke vaɬ mə riyà
nambà ʔyá ti

laʔ sə́ tə̀
mbə̀ ye
ŋ̀
laʔ s
t
mb ye
2F.SBJV say 3F.O 3F.SBJV come SUBJ
‘Tell her she should come.’
There are several pieces of evidence that /ə/ in such instances is phonetic and
not phonemic. First, there is only one instance of a word-initial /ə/, which alternates with the absence of a vowel and so is probably epenthetic: ə̀ŋ ~ ŋ̀ (2F
subjunctive subject). There is only one instance of a contrastive /ə/ in a closed
syllable, namely ndzə̀r ‘brother’ vs. ndzar ‘sister’, ndzur ‘cousin’. It is likely that
the /ə/ in ndzə̀r is the result of vowel reduction (see section 3.6, below).
Further evidence that /ə/ is epenthetic is that many morphemes with a final
/ə/ in phrase-internal position have a final /a/ in phrase-final position. There
are no instances of /ə/ in phrase-final position. For example, if the word-final
/ə/ in sə́ (3F.O) and swə ‘man, person’ were underlying, one would expect to
hear /ə/ in phrase-final position. Instead, it is replaced by the phrase-final morpheme /a/:

Additional evidence that the /ə/ in phrase-internal position is epenthetic
rather than a reduced form of an underlying /a/ is provided by the existence
of forms such as ha and wa, which retain the final /a/ in phrase-internal position:
(20) ha man yè

2M 1SG.O know ASSERT PREP head 1SG.POSS whitish-FV
‘… you (will) know me because my head is whitish.’ (ASSERT: assertive
mood)
For convenience and ease of interpretation, the epenthetic vowel is included
in forms mentioned in the text. For instance, while the underlying form of the
associative preposition is the single consonant /k/, the form kə is used in all
descriptions below. The same is true for forms such as ŋ̀ (2F.SBJV), s (3F.O),
and others.
3.6
Vowel Reduction
While many instances of phrase-internal /ə/ are epenthetic, others are the
result of vowel reduction in natural discourse, which may take place in both
open and closed syllables. The evidence that /ə/ is an outcome of vowel reduction is provided by the co-existence of the same forms with full vowels in
phrase-internal or phrase-final position:

Distribution of Phonemes
All of the consonant phonemes shown in Table 2 can occur in word-initial position. In Pévé, as in many Chadic languages, the contrast between voiced and
voiceless stops is neutralized in word-final position. There are no voiced nonglottalized stops in word-final position and there are no complex consonants
or consonant clusters attested in word-final position. The glottalized labial stop
/ɓ/ is attested in word-final position but the glottalized alveolar stop /ɗ/ is not.
Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-345phonologyThe set of consonants that are attested in word-final position is limited to
the following:
/p/

/m/

/k/
/ŋ/
/w/
/y/

ɗáw ‘one’
ɓay (conjunction)
wàʔ ‘to want’
vaɬ ‘five’
tsar ‘to get up’
il ‘to scoop out (a liquid)’Since any word-final consonant can be followed by an added final vowel (FV)
whose function is to mark the end of the utterance, all of the consonants listed
above can also occur in intervocalic position (suk-u ‘to stay in a place-FV’ tʃiriŋi ‘deep-FV’, etc.). There are a few consonants that are attested in intervocalic
position within the word but are not attested in word-final position. Many of
the words with a word-internal intervocalic consonant are borrowed or show
evidence of derivation via affixation or compounding:

4.2
Consonant Clusters
In Pévé, as in many Chadic languages, most consonant clusters are prohibited
in word- or morpheme-final position. The exception to this rule is a cluster ending in a glottal stop, as shown below. The phonological rules described here do
not necessarily apply to ideophones.
This section describes the attested consonant clusters and their distribution,
sometimes with comparative evidence showing that clusters contrast with simple consonants. Examples whose sole source is Venberg 1975 are noted as such
and have been approved by a native speaker.
The following types of morpheme-initial consonant clusters are attested in
Pévé:
Stop+Trill:pram ‘better’ (Venberg 1975); brùk ‘monitor lizard’
bròʔ ‘angry, hard-hearted, ugly’
mbraw ‘cotton’, ‘shirt, clothing’; mbrí ‘older’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3phonology47tràk ‘shoe(s)’
dram ‘muddy ground’; drayʔ ‘pestle’, ‘mortar’
krùt ‘to undress’
griŋ ‘to be saddened’, ‘to be surprised’
Fricative+Trill:
fray ‘sky’
vràʔ ‘to give birth’
srúm ‘small lance with thin blade’
zrà ‘hole’
dzràk ‘long’ (ADJ)
Glottal fricative+Continuant: hwa ‘to guess, foresee’ vs. wa ‘head’
Glottal stop+Continuant:
ʔwá ‘calm’ (ADJ) vs. wa ‘head’
ʔyá ‘to leave’ vs. ya ‘mother, female’
ʔna ‘to throw away’ vs. na (1SG subject pronoun; impersonal pronoun)
Continuant+Stop+Trill
mbri ‘big’
Velar nasal+Stop:
ŋgã ̀ ‘to tear, rip open’ vs. ŋak (type of bird)
Fricative+Glide:
swə ‘man, person’ vs. sə́ (3F object pronoun)
Labialized stop+Trill:
gwrá ‘circumcision’; gwrìʔ ‘thick, sturdy’
kwra ‘agriculture’
Stop+Stop:
kpe ‘never’
kpoʔ ‘further’ (Venberg 1975)
gbə̀gbóŋ ‘strong’
Stop+Stop+Stop
mgbiŋ mgbiŋ ‘in chorus’
mgbaŋ ‘right now’
mgbɔʔ ‘leper’ (Venberg 1975).
Given the initial Stop+Stop sequence in gbə̀gbóŋ ‘strong’, and given the lack
of other three-consonant clusters, it is possible that the sequence /gb/ (and
perhaps also /kp/) represents a single consonant, rendering /mgb/ a twoconsonant cluster of the form Nasal stop+Stop.
The few attested medial consonant clusters are very likely the result of compounding or prefixing. These include mandréw ‘pimiento’; daŋgráwʔ ‘praying
mantis’; dukri ‘night’ (from duk ‘heart, middle’ ri ‘time’).
The only attested morpheme-final clusters consist of a continuant followed
by a glottal stop:
gwayʔ
hayʔ
dáŋʔ
ʔyeŋʔ‘mountain’ vs. gwáʔ ‘to stay’
‘near, next to, beside’ vs. ndày (3PL possessive pronoun)
‘all’ vs. fáŋ ‘to return, to come back’
‘gently, weakly, sneakily’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-348chapter 2The evidence that a final glide contrasts with the final sequence Glide+Glottal stop is as follows: Repetition of the last vowel in an utterance indicates the
end of an utterance (see chapter 3). If the morpheme ends in a palatal glide,
the final added vowel is a copy of the preceding vowel:
(26) handày géwa tá só
ndày-a
3PL
return go house 3PL.POSS-FV
‘they went back to their house’
If the morpheme to which the vowel is added ends in /y/ followed by a glottal
stop, the added vowel is /i/. This provides evidence for the contrast between /y/
and /yʔ/ in word-final position:
(27) handày gáyʔ-i
3PL
stay/rest-FV
‘they stayed/rested’
The underlying glottal stop after a continuant is sometimes deleted at the normal rate of speech when followed by another consonant:
(28) mum mbə́ záa dzənàk
gáy zə̀
gu raw
mum mbə̀ záʔ dzənàk
gáyʔ zə̀
gú ráw
3M come find guinea fowl sit PREP tree many
‘He came and found guinea fowls sitting under a tree.’
4.3
Syllable and Word Structure
As noted in chapter1, the following syllable structures are attested in Pévé: V, CV,
VC, CCV(C), CCCVC (one example), and C(C) (one example: hŋ (2F indicative
subject pronoun)). The great majority of lexical and grammatical morphemes
are monosyllabic. In many instances, a polysyllabic word or morpheme shows
evidence of affixation, reduplicating, or compounding, e.g., məsín ‘other, some,
one of’ (mə REL/POSS+sín ‘different’); nambà 1PL subject (na (demonstrative?)+mbà (1PL object and possessive pronoun)); kwáti ‘food’ (kwá ‘thing’+ ti
‘eat’); ryéŋ-ryéŋ(e) ‘very small, thin’ (ryéŋ ‘small, thin’). Some, but not all, polysyllabic words that cannot be readily broken down into monosyllabic parts are
borrowings, e.g. dəbã ́ʔ ‘tobacco’ (Fr. tabac).
Unlike some Chadic languages, Pévé does not draw a phonological distinction between lexical categories: Nouns, verbs, other lexical morphemes, and
grammatical morphemes all share the same syllabic structure and the same
phonological constraints.","[56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]"
"In a clause containing a subject, an object, and an indirect object, the means
of distinguishing the direct object from the indirect object depends on the
aspect and mood of the clause and on whether the argument is represented
by a noun or a pronoun. The basics are outlined in Table 11. ‘N’ represents a
noun; ‘PRO’ represents a pronoun; ‘T/A’ represents a marker of tense or aspect;
ne is an adposition whose role is confined to marking the indirect object;
and kə is the associative preposition. The nominal or pronominal status of
the subject, or even the absence of a subject, has no impact on other coding
means. Because there are no Tense/Aspect markers in any perfective/subjunctive clauses, and because Tense/Aspect markers can often be omitted from
non-perfective clauses, pronoun forms and constituent order are often the only
means of coding tense and aspect.
The following generalizations can be made about the preceding chart:
1. In the perfective clause, ne precedes the indirect object
2. In the non-perfective clause, ne follows the indirect object
3. In the perfective clause, the indirect object can be marked by position
alone, provided it immediately follows the verb and is immediately followed by a nominal direct object.
4. The position between subject and verb serves as a coding means in two
circumstances:
(a) in the non-perfective clause with a pronominal direct object and no
indirect object (S O V); andErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3coding grammatical relations125(b) in the non-perfective clause with a nominal or pronominal indirect
object and a nominal direct object, the order S (Tense/Aspect) IO V
O alternates with S (Tense/Aspect) V IO ne.
As noted in earlier sections, there can be alternative constructions for the same
set of participants. The evidence that this is not a function of the choice of lexical items is that a clause with the same verb and the same participants may
have different forms. For example, the perfective forms S V O ne IO, S V ne IO
O, and S (Tense/Aspect) IO V O are all attested involving the verbs ‘to sell’ and
‘to give’, with the same participants. The non-perfective forms S (Tense/Aspect)
V O IO ne and S (Tense/Aspect) IO V O are both attested with the verb ‘to sell’
and the same participants.","[140, 141]"
"8Complements of Other VerbsThe following sections describe constructions with clausal verbal complements whose function is to modify or add information to the main verb. In all
cases the verb of the complement is in the nominalized form.
8.1The Verbs ɮe ‘to Start Quickly/Suddenly’ and ge ndoʔ ‘to Finish, to
End’
The complement of the verb ɮe ‘to start (quickly/suddenly/immediately)’ may
be a nominalized verb preceded by the associative preposition kə:
(110) vay ɮé kə
ne-e
child start ASSC run-FV
‘the child suddenly ran away’

(112) *ɓay yii
ɮé ʒi gayʔ kə
ndày
CONJ squirrel start play game ASSC 3PL.O
for ‘so Squirrel started to play gàyʔ with them’ (or any meaning)
The compound verb ge ndoʔ ‘to finish’ (‘make end’) may be followed by a nominal complement in the direct object position. Evidence that the complement
is a noun is that it is modified by a possessive pronoun:
(113) wãy
záʔ kum
ta gé
ndoʔ sin sá
3 days ago plus yesterday 3F make end work 3F.POSS
‘three days ago, she finished her work’
(114) mum làʔ
gé ndoʔ sin um
si
mum gàk pemãy
3M COND finish work 3M.POSS ASSERT 3M can rest
si
ASSERT
‘if he has finished his work, he can rest’
The form ndóʔ may follow the noun representing the thing that is finished. In
this case, ndóʔ functions as a modifier rather than the nominal constituent of
a compound verb:
(115) hə́ŋ làʔ
gí
kwáti ndóʔ si,
nambà də̀ ti

1PL
NEG clean house finish NEG yet
‘we did not clean the house yet’ (for ‘our housecleaning was not finished’)
8.2
The Verb káw ɓá ‘to Help’
The compound verb káw ɓá ‘to help’ (‘take/grab hand’) may be followed by
a nominalized verb marked by the associative preposition kə. The object of
the main verb is represented by an inalienable possessive pronoun, proof that
the verb is a compound verb. The only examples are elicited different-subject
clauses:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3294chapter 19(117) handày káw ɓá

1PL

8.3
The Verb gí ‘to Do, to Make’
The verb gí has a wide range of functions, including serving alone as a verb of
creation (‘to do, to make’) and serving as the first component in a number of
compound verbs. The verb gí alone can also function as a verb of causation.
In this case, gí is followed by a different-subject complement consisting of an
object pronoun followed by a verb in the unmarked form. Use of the object pronoun indicates that the subject of the causative complement, unlike the subject
of the volitional complement, has a grammatical role in the main clause:
(119) mum gí
nàn ʔyá
3M make 1SG.O leave
‘he made me leave’
(120) na gí
nùm ʔyá
1SG make 3M.O leave
‘I made him leave’
Cf. the volitional constructions, where the complement is an independent
clause:
(121) handày wàʔ i
nambà ʔyá yé
3PL
want COMP 1PL
leave PERM
‘they want us to leave’ (lit. ‘they wanted that we should leave’)
The verb ‘to do, to make’ followed by the purpose marker kə́dàn (see chapter 21)
also codes causation:
(122) mum gí
kə́dàn dàw kunə ùr
ndáʔ-a
3M make PURP child PL mount horse-FV
‘he made the children mount the horse’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3complementation9295ConclusionCoding means in complements of matrix verbs include the presence or absence
of complementizers, the independent vs. dependent nature of the complement, and the coding of the complement as the object of the matrix clause.
Unlike in some Chadic languages, the common verbs of saying in Pévé do
not differentiate between complements representing direct speech and complements representing indirect speech. Exceptions are complements of verbs
corresponding to ‘ask’ or ‘answer’, which do appear to mark the difference
between direct and indirect speech. Verbs of asking make a distinction between
the domain de dicto, coded by an independent-clause complement, and the
domain de re, coded by a dependent-clause complement that functions as the
direct object of the matrix clause. Verbs of perception, cognition, and volition
make a similar distinction using the same means. The verb corresponding to
‘to be able’ is an auxiliary rather than a matrix verb and can also function as
the sole verb in a predication. Complements of ‘to be able’, ‘to want’, and cognitive verbs are attested with the counterfactual marker kə̀və́, whose function
is to indicate that the subject’s wish or desire, or the speaker’s estimation of
the subject’s ability, was unfulfilled. A number of verbs, including ɮé ‘to start’,
ge ndoʔ ‘to finish, to end’, and káw ɓá ‘to help’, have complements only in the
domain de re, where the complement is a nominalized verb or a verbal clause
whose subject is the object of the matrix clause.","[308, 309, 310, 311]"
"2SubjectThe subject is defined here as the sole argument of an intransitive verb or the
controlling argument of a transitive verb. The defining features of the subject
argument in Pévé are as follows: (1) the subject noun or pronoun always precedes the verb, although other material may intervene between subject and
verb, and (2) the pronominal subject is represented by a member of a unique
set of pronouns that code a distinction between pronouns used in indicative clauses and pronouns used in subjunctive clauses. Both subject pronoun
sets are distinct from the pronouns that represent direct and indirect objects.
Nearly every clause has a subject noun or pronoun. Exceptions to this rule
are some imperative clauses (commands addressed to the second person) and
some clauses in which the subject referent is a known entity (see chapter 12).
The grammatical relation ‘subject’ does not imply a particular semantic relationship. The subject may be controlling or non-controlling, animate or inanimate, without further marking:

‘the chief left again’

verb, much material may occur between the subject noun or pronoun and the
verb. This material includes independent markers of tense, aspect or negation:

‘then the chief asked him’

nambà də̀ ti
2F COND made food finish ASSERT 1PL
FUT eat
‘if you have finished cooking, we will eat’
In some tenses and aspects, as described in sections 3 and 4 below, the subject noun or pronoun can be separated from the verb by a noun or pronoun
representing another argument:
(10) na də̀ ùm gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn-à
1SG FUT 3M.O sell

‘I will sell him my cow’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3106chapter 6In the following examples the subject pronoun is separated from the verb by
the negative marker, the future-tense marker, and a pronoun representing the
recipient of the event:
(11) na tsú də̀ ùm gì tsòɓ ya naw màn ne mì
1SG NEG FUT 3M.O sell
cow 1POSS ADP NEG
‘I will not sell him my cow.’
(12) mum tsú də̀ sə́ tsòɓ ne mi
3M NEG FUT 3F.O buy ADP NEG
‘he will not buy (it) for her’
The pronoun representing the direct object can also occur between the subject
and the verb:
(13) mum tsú də̀ um/sə́
tsoɓ síw
mì
3M NEG FUT 3M.O/3F.O buy tomorrow NEG
‘he will not buy it tomorrow’
The fact that many lexical and grammatical items can occur between the subject and the verb raises the question of whether the position before the verb
is the coding means for the subject or whether sentence-initial position is the
coding means for the subject. However, the subject does not have to be the first
element of the sentence, as it can be preceded by the conditional marker or a
temporal adverbial:
(14) làʔ
hə́ŋ gí
kwáti ndóʔ si
nambà də̀ ti
COND 2F made food finish ASSERT 1PL
FUT eat
‘if you have finished cooking, we will eat’ (same meaning as example 9,

handày fáŋ káw
Taobay
time 3M.POSS 3PL
arrest (‘repeat grab’) T.
‘Then they arrested Taobay.’ (For the use of kəri rùm in conditional constructions, see chapter 18.):
In the following text fragment the sentence beginning with ɓay has no connection with the preceding sentence apart from the fact that it follows that
sentence in discourse. This demonstrates that ɓay is sentence-initial and precedes the subject pronoun:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3107coding grammatical relations(16) namba dáŋʔ mbà

The subject role of the noun phrase is thus coded by the position somewhere
before the verb, though not necessarily in sentence-initial position. When more
than one argument precedes the verb (see sections 3.2 and 4.2), the subject is
the first of those arguments.
2.1
Indicative Subject Pronouns
The pronominal subject is represented by a member of one of two sets of pronouns: indicative subject pronouns and subjunctive subject pronouns. This
section focuses on indicative subject pronouns, while subjunctive subject pronouns are addressed in section 2.2.
Like pronouns of other sets, indicative subject pronouns distinguish between singular and plural in the first, second, and third person. Singular pronouns in the second and third person distinguish masculine and feminine gender (see Table 6).
Examples:
(17) nambà də̀ nde wa

The two bisyllabic subject pronouns, nambà (1PL) and handày (3PL), may be
shortened to mbà and ndày at the normal rate of speech. The absence of the
initial syllable renders the forms the same as those of the corresponding objectErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3108

handàypronouns (Tables 8, 9). This does not cause confusion, as the subject pronoun
always precedes the verb and, as shown above, precedes any other arguments
that may precede the verb. In both of the following natural discourse examples,
the first syllable of the subject pronoun was omitted:

‘They taught me Baptism class only.’
There is no neuter subject pronoun in Pévé that corresponds to ‘it’ in English.
The inanimate or non-human nature of the pronominal subject can be coded
by the absence of a subject marker:
(22) kə
ku

Subjunctive Subject Pronouns
Subject pronouns used in the subjunctive mood form a set that is distinct
from the pronouns used in the indicative mood. Subjunctive subject pronouns
referring to the second person, i.e. the addressee, further distinguish between
formal/polite forms and informal/casual forms. Functions of the two sets of
subjunctive pronouns are described in chapter 9, which also describes modal
functions coded by other markers in the subjunctive clause.
Subjunctive pronouns code the same gender and number distinctions that
are coded by indicative pronouns (see Table 7). The set of indicative pronouns
in section 2.1 is repeated in the table for convenience.
Examples with informal subjunctive subject pronouns:
(25) á

1PL.SBJV go PERM
‘let’s go!’
(27) à/ŋ
mbə̀ riʔ-i
2M.SBJV/2F.SBJV come already-FV
‘you’d better come here!’
Formal subjunctive pronouns are used only in commands to the second person. The formal subjunctive subject pronoun ì may refer to a second-person
feminine, masculine, or plural addressee, hence the use of ‘2nd.PERS’ in the
gloss:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3110

riʔ-i

When the object marker ni occurs in a formal command to a plural addressee,

‘come here!’ (plural addressee)

Given that the inanimate direct object does not have to be overtly marked (see
chapters 6 and 12), it is possible to generate an independent transitive clause
consisting solely of the verb and a marker of modality:
(33) pum ye
hit PERM
‘[you] could hit [it]’3Direct Object FunctionA direct object is defined here as the directly affected argument of a transitive
verb. A direct object can be represented by a noun or by an object pronoun
from one of two distinct sets, the perfective set and the non-perfective set (see
section 3.2, below). The means of distinguishing the direct object vs. indirect
object function of a noun or pronoun are discussed in section 4.
3.1
Nominal Direct Object
In a clause with only one non-subject argument, the grammatical role of the
nominal direct object is indicated by the position immediately after the verb
regardless of the tense, aspect, or mood of the clause. There is no evidence that
any material can intervene between the verb and the object:

3M IMPF buy cow-FV

The nominal direct object is coded by the position after the verb in the subjunctive mood as well, regardless of whether or not there is a subject marker in
the clause:

mbì riʔ-i
2M.SBJV go scoop water already-FV
‘you should go get some water’
(39) il
rəɓà

‘get some bouillie!’
3.2
Pronouns as Direct Objects
As previously stated, pronouns in Pévé do not distinguish between the direct
and the indirect object function. Non-subject pronouns are thus referred to
simply as object pronouns, and the term ‘direct object’ refers only to the grammatical relationship between the noun and the verb.
Pévé has two distinct sets of object pronouns: the perfective set and the nonperfective set. Pronouns from the perfective set represent the object in the
perfective aspect, as coded by high tone on the verb, and in the subjunctive
mood, as coded by the use of a subjunctive subject pronoun or the absence of
a subject marker in the clause. Object pronouns from the non-perfective set
are used in all non-perfective aspects and tenses but are not used in the subjunctive mood. The role of pronoun forms in coding aspect and mood is further
described in chapters 8 and 9.
3.2.1
Pronoun as Direct Object: Perfective Set
A very important distinction between the perfective set of object pronouns and
the non-perfective set has to do with how the function of direct object is coded.
As shown below, the direct object function of a pronoun from the perfective
set is marked by the position immediately after the verb in both the perfective
aspect and the subjunctive mood (SVO), while the direct object function of a
pronoun from the non-perfective set is marked by the position before the verb
(SOV; see below).
Like subject pronouns, object pronouns convey the gender of the secondor third-person referent and the number of the first, second-, or third-personErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3coding grammatical relations

of an animate non-human referent:

si
lion ate 3M.O/3F.O ASSERT

a masculine or a feminine third-person pronoun:

3.2.2
Pronoun as Direct Object: Non-perfective Set
An object pronoun from the non-perfective set can be used to represent the
direct object in all non-perfective indicative constructions but cannot be used
in subjunctive constructions. The perfective/subjunctive object set is repeated
in Table 9 (above) for purposes of comparison.
The existence of two sets of object pronouns distinguished by tense, aspect
and mood is relatively rare across languages. The fact that most object pronouns in the perfective set in Pévé have an initial n suggests that a marker n(V)
may once have had the function of distinguishing the object in a perfective
clause from the object in a non-perfective clause. It is also possible that the
marker n(V) at one time served as a postverbal marker of perfective aspect,
resulting in the following tentative path of evolution: Verb+nV Pronoun > Verb
nV Pronoun > Verb nV+Pronoun.
As shown in chapter 8, non-perfective tenses and aspects may be marked by
(a) use of the unmarked tone on the verb, or (b) a preverbal marker followed by
the verb with unmarked tone. When the direct object in a non-perfective and
non-subjunctive clause is marked by a pronoun, the pronoun follows the tense
or aspect marker and precedes the main verb, resulting in the order Subject
Tense/Aspect (T/A) marker Object Verb. (The term T/A is used instead of the
usual term TAM (tense/aspect/mood) because mood is not indicated by markers before, after, or attached to the verb; it is instead indicated by the choice of
pronoun forms and phrase-final particles (see chapter 9)). The means of codingErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3116chapter 6the direct object function of a pronoun in a non-perfective clause is thus quite
different from the means of coding the direct object function of a pronoun in
a perfective clause (see above), where the pronominal direct object immediately follows the verb. Recall that the nominal direct object in a clause with
only one non-subject argument immediately follows the verb, regardless of the
tense, aspect, or mood of the clause. Thus, the only situation in which the direct
object precedes the verb is the non-perfective/non-subjunctive clause that has
a pronominal object:
Here are some examples contrasting the position of the non-perfective
object pronoun with that of the perfective object pronoun:
Imperfective aspect (S T/A OV):
(53) lum wə́
sə́ ti
lion IMPF 3F.O eat
‘the lion is eating it’
Cf. the perfective form (SVO):
(54) lum tí sá
lion eat 3F.O
‘the lion ate it’
Future tense (non-perfective) (S T/A OV):
(55) ta də̀ nùm pum-u
3F FUT 3M.O hit-FV
‘she will hit him’
Cf. the perfective form (SVO):
(56) ta púm nùm
3F hit 3M.O
‘she hit him’
Other examples of the non-perfective object pronoun in preverbal position:
(57) ʃīŋ
ɬew wə
man gun-u
smell meat IMPF 1SG.O bother-FV
‘the smell of the meat is bothering me’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3coding grammatical relations117(58) mum də̀ sə́ tsoɓ síw(-i)
3M FUT 3F.O buy tomorrow(-FV)
‘he will buy it tomorrow’
In a clause that has the same arguments and the same temporal value, the direct
object in the form of a full noun follows rather than precedes the verb, resulting
in the form S T/A VO:
(59) mum də̀ tsòɓ vu síw(-i)
3M FUT buy salt tomorrow-FV
‘he will buy salt tomorrow’
(60) mum wə́
tsòɓ vu
3M PRES buy salt
‘he is buying salt (now)’
In a non-perfective clause, the marker coding future tense or imperfective
aspect is often omitted in natural discourse. If the direct object is pronominal, the use of a pronoun from the non-perfective set and the position of the
pronoun before the verb indicates that the clause is non-perfective, i.e. neither
perfective nor subjunctive. Whether the clause is interpreted as imperfective
or future depends on the context and the nature of the event:
(61) ha màn yè
si
2M 1SG.O know ASSERT
‘You know me.’ or ‘You will know me.’4Indirect ObjectIn Pévé, means of distinguishing between the function of indirect object and
the function of direct object include the relative order of constituents in the
clause and the use of the designated indirect object marker ne, derived from
the noun ne ‘give’. The form ne is glossed ‘ADP’ for ‘adposition’, as it sometimes
occurs before the noun or pronoun representing the indirect object and sometimes occurs after the noun or pronoun representing the indirect object (see
below). As shown in Améka 2003, the use of the same adposition in either
prenominal or postnominal position is very rare across languages (the example Améka 2003 provides comes from Dutch, as described in Van Riemsdijk
1990). As shown below, the means of coding the grammatical role of the indi-Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3118chapter 6rect object in Pévé depend on the tense, aspect, and mood of the clause and
the presence or absence of an overt direct object.
While the precise semantic role of the indirect object is a function of the
inherent meaning of the verb and the arguments in the clause, the indirect
object is typically less directly affected by the event than is the direct object.
The semantic roles of indirect object arguments include the recipient of a thing
given, the beneficiary of the event, the addressee of certain verbs, and a participant who suffers from the event (‘malefactive’). The semantic roles of the
indirect object are further discussed in chapter 7.
The following sections describe the means of marking the indirect object
role of a nominal argument, the means of marking the indirect object role of a
pronominal argument in a perfective or subjunctive clause, and the means of
marking the indirect object role of a pronominal argument in a non-perfective
clause.
4.1
Nominal Indirect Object
When the indirect object in a perfective or non-perfective clause is represented
by a noun rather than a pronoun, the function of the indirect object can be
marked by the adposition ne followed by the associative preposition kə. The
order of constituents is S V O ne kə IO:
(62) mum ti fún ɓay mum ár
kam
rùm
ne kə
3M eat food CONJ 3M leave remainder 3M.POSS ADP ASSC
vay um-u
child 3M.POSS-FV
‘he ate, but he left the rest for his son’
In many cases involving a nominal indirect object, the adposition ne is omitted. This is true for both perfective and non-perfective clauses (as shown in
section 4.2.2 below, the omission of ne is not limited to clauses with the verb né
‘give’):
Perfective:
(63) Taú né kwá kə
ndzar rum
kuni
kə́dàn ti
T. give thing ASSC sisters 3M.POSS DED.PL PURP eat
‘Tau gave his sisters something to eat’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3coding grammatical relations119Non-perfective:
(64) ya vay wə́
né kwáti kə
vay
mother IMPF give food ASSC child
‘the mother is giving food to her child’
The adposition ne can be omitted even when the clause involves a nominal
indirect object but no direct object:
(65) mum ndéwa kə
yii
3M meet ASSC squirrel
‘He met with Squirrel.’
4.2
Pronouns as Indirect Object
The same sets of pronouns (perfective and non-perfeecctive) that represent
the direct object may also represent the indirect object. as stated in section
3.2, above. Because the indirect and direct object pronouns are identical, other
means must be used to distinguish the indirect object pronoun from the direct
object pronoun. These means include (a) the relative order of constituents in
the clause, and (b) the adposition ne, which can mark the indirect object but
not the direct object. Most important, when ne does occur it precedes the indirect object pronoun in the perfective or subjunctive clause and follows the
indirect object pronoun in the non-perfective clause (see below).
4.2.1
Perfective Set
A clause that is marked for perfective aspect or subjunctive mood and contains
a pronominal indirect object has two possible word orders: S V (ne) IO O and S V
O (ne) IO. The form S V O (ne) IO appears to be the more common or colloquial
form:
(66) nambà gi
soko ne ni

‘We thank you.’ (lit. ‘we make thanks for you’)
(67) ta ɓá

grandfather buy hoe ADP 1PL.O ASSERT
‘grandfather bought us a hoe’
Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3120chapter 6The marker ne can be omitted, resulting in the structure S V IO O:
(69) mum táʔ nàn kwá
3M show 1SG.O thing
‘he taught me something’
When the main verb in the construction is the verb né ‘to give’ and the direct
object pronoun immediately follows the verb, the indirect object pronoun must
be marked by the adposition ne (S V O ne IO):
(70) mum né ʒyè
ne nàn-a
3M give peanuts ADP 1SG.O-FV
‘he gave me peanuts’
In what appears to be a more formal construction, the indirect object pronoun
may immediately follow the verb and precede the direct object, without the
adposition ne (S V IO O). The evidence that né in the next example represents
the verb ‘give’ rather than the adposition ne is provided by high tone on the
verb, which codes the perfective aspect. The more formal version may reflect
an aversion to use of the verb né and the adposition ne in the same clause:
(71) mum né nàn ʒyè
3M give 1SG.O peanuts
‘he gave me peanuts’
All attested examples in the subjunctive mood, as coded either by the absence
of a subject pronoun or by the use of a subject pronoun from the subjunctive
set, have the form S V O ne IO:
(72) à
tsoɓ kwáti
ne nàn riʔ-i
2M.SBJV buy food (lit. ‘thing eat’) ADP 1SG.O already-FV
‘you’d better buy me something to eat!’
(73) à
də̀ il
mbì ne mbà riʔ-i
2M.SBJV go scoop out water ADP 1PL.O already-FV
‘go fetch us some water!’
If the perfective or subjunctive clause does not contain an overt direct object,
the pronominal indirect object must be marked by ne even when it occurs in
the position after the verb, resulting in the structure S V ne IO:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3coding grammatical relations121(74) na dàn ne nù kum-u
1SG say ADP 2M.O yesterday-FV
‘I advised/told you (that) yesterday’
(75) na ín ne nù
1SG say ADP 2M.O
‘I read (it) for you’
The role of the indirect object can thus be coded by the position immediately
after the verb (i.e., without ne) if and only if the clause also contains a direct
object. What all examples involving an indirect object in the perfective aspect
or the subjunctive mood have in common is this: When the marker ne is used,
it precedes the indirect object noun or pronoun, regardless of the relative order
of other constituents in the clause. The importance of this is shown in the next
section.
4.2.2
Non-perfective Set
In all tenses, aspects and moods other than the perfective and the subjunctive, the indirect object may be coded in one of two ways: By the marker ne
following the indirect object, in the order S Tense/Aspect V (O) IO ne, or by
the position immediately before the verb, in the order S Tense/Aspect IO V O.
In the latter construction, the indirect object role is coded by preverbal position alone. Evidence that the position of the indirect object before the verb
codes non-perfective aspect is that it does not occur in any other type of construction. Indirect object pronouns in non-perfective clauses are identical with
direct object pronouns of the non-perfective set (Table 9).
The non-perfective structures S Tense/Aspect V (O) IO ne and S Tense/
Aspect IO V (O) are attested with the verb ‘to give’ as well as with other verbs:
S Tense/Aspect V O IO ne:
(76) na də̀ gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn
ùm ne
1SG FUT sell
cow 1SG.POSS 3M.O ADP
‘I will sell him my cow’
The construction S Tense/Aspect IO V (O) codes focus on the indirect object:
(77) na də̀ ùm gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn-à
1SG FUT 3M.O sell
cow
1SG.POSS-FV
‘I will sell him my cow’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3122chapter 6In the non-perfective clause involving the verb ‘to give’, as in the perfective
clause, the form without the adposition ne (S Tense/Aspect IO V O) appears
to be more formal than the construction that includes ne (S Tense/Aspect V O
IO ne). Again, this may reflect a constraint on the co-occurrence of the verb ne
‘give’ and the grammatical marker ne:
S Tense/Aspect IO V O (formal):
(78) mum də̀ màn ne hu ɗáw-à
3M FUT 1SG.O give goat one-FV
‘he will give me a goat’
(79) mum wə́

‘he is giving us a goat’

ndzə̀r rin-i
1SG FUT give goat ASSC brother 1SG.POSS-FV
‘I will give my brother a goat’
As is the case in the perfective or subjunctive clause, the indirect object must
be marked by ne even if there is no direct object in the clause (in the following example, the form dàn ‘word’ is part of the compound verb, not a direct
object):
(82) na wə

and as markers of inalienable possession.of a subjunctive clause, direct or indirect object of a perfective or subjunctive clause, and direct or indirect object of all other clauses (‘non-perfective’).
Table 10 compares the various pronoun forms. All pronouns distinguish masculine and feminine gender in the second- and third-person singular forms.
A pronoun labeled as ‘Object’ can represent either the direct or the indirect
object. The presence of the initial /n/ in a number of perfective object pronouns and the presence of the initial /m/ in a number of non-perfective object
pronouns suggest traces of earlier pre-pronominal markers, which may have
once served as postverbal markers.
The noun or pronoun representing the subject always precedes the verb.
Other elements, including other arguments, may intervene between the indicative subject and the verb. The subjunctive subject pronoun can be omitted with
no apparent change in meaning or function.
In a perfective or non-perfective clause with only a subject and a nominal
direct object, the object noun immediately follows the verb. In a perfective
clause with only a subject and a pronominal object, the object pronoun follows the verb. In a non-perfective clause with only a subject and a pronominal
object, the object pronoun precedes the verb. In a clause with only a subject
and an indirect object, the indirect object noun follows the verb and is marked
by the adposition ne. The adposition precedes the indirect object in the perfective and follows the indirect object in the non-perfective.","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"
"6Post-nominal ModifiersAs shown above, markers that precede the head noun may code the natural
gender of the animate referent of the head noun or the relative size, age, or
importance of the head noun. The following sections describe forms and functions of modifiers that follow the head noun.
6.1
Plurality
As shown in section 3, singularity or plurality of a noun may be marked by
a suppletive noun form, a compound noun form that may or may not be
related to the singular form, or a verb that has inherent number. The number of the head noun may also be marked by several postnominal means as
well.
Certain adjectives are either inherently singular or either inherently plural.
An adjective that is inherently singular or plural may co-occur with a noun that
is also inherently singular or plural:

Plurality of a noun can also be marked through reduplication of a postnominal modifier. In the following example, the reduplicated form fol-fol indicates

An interesting feature is the presence of a postnominal demonstrative/determiner, kunə, which codes both plurality and referentiality of the head noun.
In both of the following examples the noun àdə́ ‘dog’ is referential, since it is
identified as belonging to the owner Kə̀ɗà. The use of kunə, which becomes
kuni before a high vowel, therefore codes plurality only:
(23) handày tʃí àdə́ Kə̀ɗà kuni sí

(24) handày tʃí àdə́ Kə̀ɗà sí
3PL
kill dog K.
ASSERT
‘they killed Kə̀ ɗà’s dog’
When plurality of the noun is coded by some other means, the presence of the
demonstrative plural marker kunə codes only the referentiality of the plural
noun (the function of kunə in the reference system is described in chapter 12):
ndʒíwkwá ‘men’ ndʒíwkwá kunə ‘those men’
In the following examples the inherently plural verb ráʔ ‘take (PL)’ codes plurality of the object in the transitive clause (see ch. 4). The plural determiner
kunə thus codes only the referential status of the object:
(25) nambà raʔ
tímbì

‘we took those small red calabashes’
(26) nambà raʔ

take (PL) goat PL ASSERT
‘we took those goats’ (either the goats are visible or we have been talking
about them)
Compare the plural verb without the plural determiner:
(27) nambà ráʔ
hu si
1PL
take (PL) goat ASSERT
‘we took several/many goats’ (the goats are not specified)
Compare also the singular form, where singularity is marked solely by the verb
form:
(28) nambà ɬé
hu si
1PL
take (SG) goat ASSERT
‘we took a goat’
The plural demonstrative, when it occurs, is the final component of the noun
phrase, regardless of the form of the noun phrase:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-386chapter 5(29) yá náw mə̀ ɓú

Phrase-final markers of plurality are found in some Chadic languages of other
branches as well, including Mupun (West Chadic; Frajzyngier 1993) and Giziga
(Central Chadic; Shay 2012, ms.). Here is a relevant example from Giziga:

6.2
Modification by an Adjective
An adjective is defined here as a lexical morpheme that refers to an attribute
and whose inherent grammatical function is to modify a noun. In Pévé, an
inherent adjective follows the noun it modifies. As is the case in many Chadic
languages, there is often no distinction between a noun phrase of the form
Noun Adjective and an attributive clause of the form Noun Adjective:
(31) ndá uráʔ-a
horse black-FV
‘a/the black horse’ or ‘the horse is black’
(32) hu toŋ
goat large
‘a/the large goat’ or ‘the goat is large’
(33) mbìr kĩ ́
milk small
‘a little milk’ or ‘the amount of milk is small’
(34) mbìr ɓáyrúm
milk large
‘a lot of milk’ or ‘the amount of milk is large’
When the subject is a proper noun, the sequence Noun Adjective has only the
attributive function:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-387nouns and the noun phrase(35) Sə́ráy mbúɗ dzərak-a
S.
grow long
‘Sə́ ráy is tall/fully grown’ but not ‘the tall/fully grown Sə́ ráy’ (Pévé does not
have an adjective corresponding to ‘tall’)
There are relatively few inherent adjectives in the Pévé lexicon. Many attributes
that are expressed by adjectives in other languages are expressed in Pévé by
abstract nouns. A lexical item that is not an inherent adjective is marked
for the modifying function by the relative marker mə̀, resulting in a relative
clause. The abstract noun ɓú ‘whiteness’, for example, is not an inherent adjective:
(36) ya nãw mə̀ ɓú
cow REL whiteness
‘the cow is white (‘the cow that is [of] whiteness’)’
Pévé has no inherent adjective corresponding to ‘sick’ or ‘ill’. The abstract noun
gáɓ ‘illness’ in the modifying function is preceded by the relative marker and
the associative preposition kə, a marker with a wide range of functions in the
language (see section 6.7, section 7, and subsequent chapters). In the following
example the preposition kə indicates that the object of the relative clause is
possessed by the head noun. Note that plurality of the head noun is indicated
by the plural demonstrative kunə at the end of the noun phrase:
(37) handày fól
ya nãw mə̀ kə
gáɓ kunə tsóp-ó
3PL
slaughter cow REL ASSC illness PL first-FV
‘they slaughter the sick cows (lit. ‘cows that are with illness’) first’
The notion of hunger can be described by the complex noun phrase mẽ ́ tí kwá
‘(the) need to eat something’ (derived from mẽʔ ‘saliva’ + titi ‘hurt’ (intrans.)).
The associative preposition kə indicates that the head noun is the possessor of
the attribute:

It is shown in section 6.1 that a few adjectives are inherently singular or inherently plural and that plurality of the head noun can be indicateded by reduplication of the postnominal adjective. An inherent adjective can also be fully or
partially reduplicated to code intensity, e.g. ryéŋ ‘small’, ryéŋ-ryéŋ(e) ‘very small,
thin’; tʃiriŋ ‘deep’, tʃiriŋ-riŋ ‘very deep’; and rõwã ‘tall’, and rõwã-rõwã ‘very tall’.
6.3
Modification by a Noun
Section 5 demonstrates that when the first noun in the sequence Noun1 Noun2
codes gender or relative size, Noun1 functions as modifier of Noun2. When
Noun1 does not code gender or relative size, Noun2 is the modifier of Noun1:
(40) na ti ɬew nãw kúm-ú
1SG eat meat bovine yesterday-FV
‘I ate beef (‘bovine meat’) yesterday’
When the second noun in the sequence Noun1 Noun2 has an animate referent,
Noun2 usually functions as the possessor of Noun1:
(41) mum wə́
só
dʒwa
3M IMPF house chief
‘he is in the chief’s house’
(42) na wàʔ i
à
tsar gaɓ vay màn
1SG want COMP 2M.SBJV lift illness child 1SG.POSS
‘I want you to heal my child’ (‘lift my child’s illness’)
In the structure Noun1 Noun2, there is no structural distinction between the
noun as attributive modifier and the noun as possessor:
(43) fə̀tà lúmò tá wə́
gi tsoɓ súm-u
day market 3F IMPF sell

‘on market day/the day of the market, she sells beer’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3nouns and the noun phrase89(44) sowã Maroua
people M.
‘the people of Maroua/the Maroua people’
There is no evidence of a sequence of adjectives modifying the same head
noun, as in ‘big black horse’ or ‘her black horse’. Solicited sentences with an
object noun phrase involving both an adjective and a possessive pronoun have
the form S V O Possessor REL Adjective:
(45) na gəɓó mota Taú mə uraʔ
n-a

(46) na ŋgã mbəraw man
mə ɓu
nə
si
1SG tear coat
1SG.POSS REL white DED.M ASSERT
‘I tore my white coat’
A noun with a prenominal modifier indicating an inherent property of the head
noun can be followed by an adjective without additional marking:
(47) na gilaʔ kəmbat so
Səray
1SG repair old
house S.
‘I repaired Səray’s old house’
In the recursive sequence Noun1 Noun2 Noun3/Pronoun, each noun or pronoun
modifies the noun that precedes it. If the referent is animate, the relationship
coded is that of possession:
(48) ta tá só

‘He said, “One of you took my tobacco on credit (lit. ‘my tobacco’s credit’)
the day before yesterday.”’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-390chapter 5Given that there are constructions in which the noun precedes the noun it
modifies (section 5), it is sometimes difficult to say whether Noun1 modifies
Noun2 or vice versa when both nouns have animate referents. The meaning of
the next examples could be ‘female child’ vs. ‘male child’ (Modifier Noun) or
‘small female’ vs. ‘small male’ (Noun Modifier):
(50) vay ma
child woman
(51) vay ndʒí

The same form may also function as the argument of a proposition:
(52) ma
mə̀ ti
ha wé rə
mbə́ si
woman REL PRO 2M see POST come ASSERT
‘the woman you saw has come’
Similarly, the feminine marker ya, which marks the gender of an animate entity
or the size of an inanimate entity (sections 5.1–5.2), may also function as the
head of a noun phrase:
(53) ya
vay wə́
ne kwáti kə
vay
mother child IMPF give food ASSC child
‘the child’s mother is feeding her child’ (not ‘female child’ or ‘large child’)
The sequence Noun1 Noun2 thus has different functions and interpretations,
depending on shared information and surrounding discourse. The sequence
Noun1 Noun2 can also function as a compound noun, discussed in section 9.1.
6.4
Possessive Pronouns
Pévé has two distinct sets of possessive pronouns. In keeping with Chadic linguistic tradition, these sets are labeled ‘alienable’ vs. ‘inalienable’. It should
be noted, however, that the class to which a given lexical item belongs is a
language-specific question and is not based on the nature of the real-world referent.
Table 5 shows the two sets of possessive pronouns. Note that wherever there
is a distinction between the inalienable and the alienable possessive pronoun,
the inalienable pronoun begins with the consonant /r/. This is true even when
the inalienable pronoun is not obviously derived from the alienable form. TheErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-391nouns and the noun phrase

ndàypresence of the initial /r/ thus suggests traces of an earlier pre-pronominal
marker whose function was to indicate inalienable possession. Interestingly,
pronouns from the inalienable possessive set also serve as objects of prepositions, while pronouns from the alienable possessive set are identical with
object pronouns from the unmarked (‘non-perfective’) set (see chapter 6).
The category of inalienable possession includes body-part terms and certain
lexical items corresponding to family relations, including ‘wife’, ‘brother’, and
‘sister’:
(54) hum/i rìn
ear/eye 1SG.POSS
‘my ear(s)/eye(s)’
(55) ɓá rum

hand 2PL.POSS
‘your (2PL) hands’
In the next example the inalienable possessive pronoun modifies the noun
syem ‘time, occurrence’. A possible explanation for this is that the form syem
also denotes the body part ‘foot’, which may well be the source of the abstract
noun syem:
(59) syem híndʒiʔ rùm
n-a
time three 3M.POSS DED.M-FV
‘the third time’
The much broader category of alienable possession includes nouns denoting
other family relationships, including ‘child’, ‘mother’, ‘father’, and ‘husband’;
nouns corresponding to ‘friend’, ‘house’, and ‘home’; nouns with non-human
animate referents; and nouns with inanimate referents:
(60) ya/ba/ndʒí

‘my mother/father/husband’

‘your (f.) friend’
(63) so/syemɗe/ya nãw/ndʒin wũ

‘your (m.) house/name/cow/story’
Pévé speakers without formal education tend to use the alienable form, rather
than the inalienable form, with nouns corresponding to ‘wife’, ‘brother’, and
‘sister’:
(64) ma wũ (not rù)
wife 2M.POSS
for ‘your wife’

sister 1SG.POSS

Possession of the noun tú ‘body’ can be marked by an alienable or inalienable
possessive pronoun, with no apparent difference in meaning:
(66) tu man
titi
body 1SG.POSS hurt.hurt
‘I am very sick (lit. ‘the body hurts me’)’ (alienable)

(68) mum táʔ tú rùm
ne
nàn
3M show body 3M.POSS PREP 1SG.O
‘he showed himself (‘his body’) to me’ (inalienable)
In some cases the choice between inalienable and alienable possessor indicates
a referential distinction. In this example, the alienable possessive pronoun
refers to the person who named the price:
(69) tsoɓ màn (alienable)
price 1SG.POSS
‘my price’ (for my merchandise)
In the next example, use of the inalienable possessive pronoun codes reference
to the price itself:
(70) tsoɓ rùm (inalienable)
price 3M.POSS
‘its (lit. ‘his’) price’
Again, the function of the inalienable possessive pronoun vs. the alienable
possessive pronoun depends in part on shared information and surrounding
discourse.","[99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109]"
"2Classification and NomenclatureThe classification and nomenclature of Pévé has been subject to much discussion both within and outside of the world of descriptive linguistics. Section 2.1
below summarizes past and existing approaches, while Section 2.2 describes
more recent discussions and findings.
2.1
Existing Approaches to Classification and Nomenclature
With respect to the name and classification of the Pévé language, there are
considerable differences of opinion among linguists and native speakers of languages spoken in the area. According to Ethnologue, Pévé is a member of the
Masa branch of the Chadic family, a branch that also includes Herdé, Marba,
Masana, Mesmé, Musey, Ngeté, and Zumaya (https://www.ethnologue.com/
language/lme). Languages referred to in Ethnologue as Pévé dialects include
Lamé, Doe (also called Doué, Duwoi, or Duwai), and Dari. Also according to
Ethnologue, the name Zimé is used by outsiders to refer to the languages of
Herdé, Ngeté, Pévé, and Mesmé. Alternative names listed by Ethnologue for
Pévé are Kado, Kaʔdo Pévé (both pejorative; see section 2.2 below), Lamé and
Zimé. Newman (2013 and elsewhere) also places Pévé in the Masa branch and
labels Pévé, Lamé, and Dari as dialects of Zimé. Sachnine’s works (1976, 1978,
1982) equate the name Lamé with Zimé and Vún Dzə̀ pàò (literally ‘mouth of
Dzəpao’), also referred to as Dzəbao, Djipa, Dzəbao, Djibao, Dzibaw, or Jibaw.
These works also identify Pévé, Dari, and Dzəbao as dialects of Lamé. Sach-© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020 | doi:10.1163/9789004410053_002Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-32chapter 1nine 1982 states (as does Jungraithmayr 1978) that Pévé and Lamé belong to a
larger language group called Zimé. Jungraithmayr 1978 analyzes Pévé as a member of a ‘Zime dialect cluster’, whose other dialects are said to include Dari,
Herdé, and Ngeté, all of which are listed in Ethnologue as dialects of Pévé. Jungraithmayr also includes Mesmé (considered by Ethnologue to be a distinct
language) in this cluster, along with several other dialects or languages. In this
approach, ‘Pévé proper’ is broken down into the dialects Lamé, Doué, Bisi (also
Bissi or Bissa) Keda, and Badjé. Jungraithmayr 1978 states that some speakers
within the Zimé cluster accept being called ‘Kaɗó’ or ‘Gaʔɗó’ (‘pagan’ in Fulfulde (Niger-Congo)). Some Pévé speakers accept the use of Lamé to refer to
the Pévé language while also asserting that Lamé is a place and not a language.
According to Venberg 1975, the large Mundang population uses the term ‘Lamé’
in reference to both the Pévé language and the people who speak it. This is complicated by the fact that many speakers of other languages in the area, e.g. the
Bibemi of Cameroon, also call themselves Lamé, though their primary language
is Mambai (Niger-Congo). The same is true for many speakers of Mundang.
2.2
The Current Approach
Native speakers of Pévé do not necessarily agree with the nomenclature or classification of the Pévé language as described in section 2.1. According to native
Pévé speaker and collaborator Lazare Wambadang, Sachnine’s use of the term
Lamé to refer to Vún Dzəbao reflects the fact that speakers of Pévé and Dzebao
in Cameroon accept the term Lamé to refer to their respective languages (Sachnine 1982). In a region inhabited by Dzebao, including the villages of Dzebao,
Gor, Ganmbour, Madingring, and others, speakers will state that they are Lamé
speakers, while recognizing that there is a difference between the dialect of
Pévé and their own dialect, namely Dzebao. The Ethnologue list of alternative
names for Pévé, which includes Kado, Kaʔdo Pévé (both pejorative), Lamé, and
Zimé, does not reflect the current state of affairs. Kaʔɗó is a derogatory term
used by Herdé speakers in referring to Pévé. The Pévé people do not accept the
name Zimé as their own, since Zimé is a language they don’t understand and a
culture whose customs they don’t share. The Zimé (Herdé) of Chad do not want
to be termed Lamé because this would lead to classification with the Canton
Lamé even though their own canton is Canton Herdé. Despite this opposition, a
princess of the Chief of Canton Lamé (therefore Pévé) is married to the current
head of Canton de Herdé. In any case, Ethnologue has not identified a dialect
that is neither Pévé nor Vún Dzebao, much less Herdé or simply Zimé.
Wambadang’s studies show that none of the classifications adopted in previous linguistic works fully captures the historical and linguistic relationships
among Pévé speakers and speakers of neighboring and/or related languages.","[17, 18]"
"2First Mention: Bare Noun PhraseIn this work the term ‘bare noun phrase’ refers to a noun phrase that is not
marked by a determiner from any of the sets described in sections 3 and 7,
below. The bare noun phrase may consist of a noun alone, a noun followed by
a modifier or possessive marker, or a noun followed by a relative clause whose
function is modify the head noun. In any case, the function of the bare noun
phrase is to indicate first mention of the entity to which the head noun refers.
The bare noun phrase may or may not function as a new topic of conversation.
The following natural discourse passage contains the first mention of the
head nouns brùk ‘monitor lizard’, də̀bãʔ ‘tobacco’, and só ‘village’. The head noun© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020 | doi:10.1163/9789004410053_013Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3207system of referencesó and the nominal modifier dzənàk ‘guinea fowl’ together form a bare noun

3chapter 12Deducible Reference Markers: nə, rə and kunəIn the present work, ‘deducible reference’ means that the speaker believes the
listener can deduce the referent of a given noun without information as to the
particular domain of reference, which may involve previous mention, knowledge shared by the speaker and listener, widespread common knowledge, deictic reference, and other domains. A distinction is drawn between deducible
reference and reference to an unknown entity (see section 4).
Deducible reference in Pévé is marked by the determiner nə (masc.) or rə
(fem.) or by the general plural marker kunə at the end of the noun phrase. The
deducible reference marker may follow any noun (proper or common), adjective, modifying noun, deictic marker, or relative clause that modifies the head
noun. As shown in chapter 17, deducible reference markers also function as
post-relative markers in the relative clause.
In many cases the deducible reference marker indicates that the referent
has been previously mentioned. In the following example, the first mention
of the entity vay dzənàk ‘young guinea fowl’ is marked by a bare noun phrase,
as described in section 2. The second mention of the same referent is marked
by the noun dzənàk followed by the masculine deducible reference marker nə.
Note that dzənàk, on first mention, functions as the modifier of the head noun
vay, while dzənàk on second mention functions as the head of the noun phrase.
This provides evidence that deducible reference is a function that is independent from the grammatical function of the noun in question:

In the next example the subject noun ma ‘woman’, marked by the feminine
deducible reference marker rə, was mentioned earlier in the text:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3209system of reference(7) ma

As shown in the examples 1–5 above, a bare noun phrase with a plural referent
is not overtly marked for plurality on first mention but is marked by the plural
reference marker kunə on subsequent mention. Evidence that kunə is not simply a marker of nominal plurality is that kunə can follow an inherently plural
noun such as dàw ‘children’:
(8) dàw
kuni [kunə] ì
mbə̀ yé
children PL
2PL.SBJV come PERM
‘you kids come over here!’
Most of the examples above would seem to indicate that the function of the
determiner rə, nə or kunə is to mark previous mention. However, not all previously mentioned entities are marked for previous mention. In the following
natural discourse examples, the bolded nouns refer to entities that were previously mentioned in the text but are not followed by any marker indicating
previous mention:

‘What did he give to the children?’
A proper noun is inherently deducible and therefore is not marked by rə, nə or
kunə on first mention or subsequent mention. The following natural discourse
passage contains the first and second mentions of the character yíi ‘squirrel’,
which functions as a proper noun in the text. Neither mention is marked for
deducible reference, providing evidence that the markers rə, nə and kunə do notErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3210chapter 12mark previous mention. The noun brùk ‘monitor lizard’, which also functions
as a proper noun in the text, is also unmarked, even though it was mentioned
earlier in the text:

Whenever the deducible reference marker follows a noun phrase, the function
of modifiers within the noun phrase is to narrow the scope of deducibility.
Again, the function of the deducible reference marker is not limited to previous mention. In the following example, the nouns ndzə̀r ‘brother’ and ndzar
‘sister’ have not been previously mentioned. The plural marker kunə tells the
listener that the referent is deducible, while use of the possessive pronoun rin
narrows the scope of reference:
(14) ndzə̀r rin
kə
ndzar rin
kunə
(ɓa)wa si
brother 1SG.POSS ASSC sister 1SG.POSS DED.PL reunite ASSERT
‘my brothers and sisters reunited’ (brothers and sisters were not previously mentioned)
Similarly with the following elicited example, where the noun ya nãw ‘cow’ has
not been previously mentioned. The deducible reference marker rə tells the listener that the referent is deducible, while the possessive pronoun màn narrows
the scope of reference:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3211system of reference(15) na də̀ ùm gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn
r-a
1SG FUT 3M.O sell
cow
1SG.POSS DED.F-FV
‘I will sell him my cow’ (the cow has not been previously mentioned)
When the noun is a common noun, the referent has not been previously mentioned, and the clause provides no means of narrowing the scope of reference,
the deducible reference marker cannot be used:
(16) handày tsóɓ ya nãw *rə
3PL
buy fem bovine DED.F
for ‘they bought a cow’
Use of the first-person plural possessive pronoun mbà after a proper noun
reduces the scope of reference to an entity known to both speaker and hearer,
hence the deducible reference marker can be used:
(17) swə mbà
nə
mbə́ sí
man 1PL.POSS DED.M come ASSERT
‘the (lit. ‘our’) man has come’
The deducible reference marker may also follow a noun whose referent is visible but has not been previously mentioned:
(18) ya
ndaʔ rə
uraʔ-a
female horse DED.F black-FV
‘that mare (or ‘the mare over there’) is black’ (the listener can see the
mare)
The scope of reference can also be narrowed by a relative clause modifying
the head noun. Again, the deducible reference marker tells the listener that
the referent can be deduced and the modifier narrows the scope of reference:
(19) à
kar sowã mə nàyʔ
kun-a
2M.SBJV look people REL DIST.M DED.PL-FV
‘look at the people over there!’
The function of nə, rə, or kunə is not limited to indicating previous reference, as
shown above. However, because the use of nə, rə, or kunə after a noun phrase
consisting solely of a common noun usually implies previous reference, thisErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3212chapter 12can be considered the default domain of reference when the noun is followed
by nə, rə, or kunə:
(20) só

‘the houses are large’ (the houses have been previously mentioned)
(21) laʔ dàn ya nãw rə

domains, as described in other sections and chapters.","[222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"

1IntroductionThis appendix consists of a compilation of pronominal and referential markers discussed in various chapters, followed by a summary of word orders and the functions
they encode.","[334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3chapter 6Coding Grammatical Relations
1IntroductionThe term ‘grammatical relations’ refers here to the functional relations between
the verb and the noun phrase(s) in a clause. These relations include the subject, the object, and the indirect object, as defined in sections below. As stated
in chapter 1, in the pronoun set there is no distinction between direct object
pronouns and indirect object pronouns. The terms ‘direct object’ and ‘indirect
object’, as used in the present chapter, thus refer to the grammatical relations
between the verb and its arguments rather than to the form of the pronoun that
represents an argument. Because there is no direct vs. indirect object distinction within the pronoun system, a pronoun that may represent either a direct
object or an indirect object is referred to simply as an object pronoun, glossed
as O for ‘Object’.
In addition to subject vs. object pronoun distinctions, the grammatical relationship between a given noun phrase and the verb can be coded by one or
more of the following means: the position of the noun phrase with respect to
the verb; the position of the noun phrase with respect to another noun phrase;
the indirect object marker ne (glossed ‘ADP’ for ‘adposition’), derived from the
verb ‘to give’; the associative preposition kə; a pronoun coding a specific grammatical relation; and the position of a pronoun with respect to another noun
phrase or pronoun. Pronouns are neither prefixes nor suffixes, and there is no
coding of grammatical relations on the verb itself or on the noun stem. Pévé
also has an impersonal pronoun, na, whose functions in the domains of reference and complementation resemble the functions of ‘that’, ‘it’ and certain
other forms in English. The form na and its functions are discussed in chapters
11 and 19.
An important feature of Pévé is that the coding of grammatical relations
is inseparable from the coding of tense, aspect, and mood. Different linear
orders and different pronoun forms are used in different tenses, aspects, and
moods, and in some cases the choice of pronoun form and/or the linear order
of constituents is the only means of coding tense, aspect, or mood (see chapters 8–10). With respect to the subject argument, the primary distinction is
between the indicative mood and the subjunctive mood. With respect to all
other arguments, the primary distinction is between the perfective aspect and
the subjunctive mood on the one hand and all other tenses, aspects, and moods© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020 | doi:10.1163/9789004410053_007Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3104chapter 6on the other. For convenience, this distinction is referred to as ‘perfective’ vs.
‘non-perfective’. The interaction of grammatical relations with other means of
coding tense, aspect, and mood is explored further in later chapters.
This chapter describes the means of coding the grammatical relations subject, object, and indirect object in perfective and non-perfective simple sentences. The interaction of grammatical relations and mood is further discussed
in chapter 9. The coding of grammatical relations in negative clauses is addressed in chapter 14, and the coding of grammatical relations in complex
sentences is addressed in chapter 19.","[118, 119, 120]"
"2.1
Labial Consonants: b, p, ɓ, m, mb
Pévé distinguishes five underlying labial consonants: the labial stops /b/ and
/p/, the glottalized labial stop /ɓ/, the labial nasal /m/ and the prenasalized
labial stop /mb/. The evidence for the underlying status of each consonant is
provided by contrast with other consonants having the same place of articulation:
/b/
/p/
/ɓ/
/m/
/mb/bà ~ bàr (dialect variation) ‘to lie down; to put to bed’; bay ‘friend’; bòʔ
a type of melon
par ‘to remove’; ‘trade, commerce’ (N); pày ‘to search for, to explain, to
unearth’; poʔ ‘to pay’; pe ‘to hit’
ɓáy ‘good’, ‘pretty’; ɓo (marker of promise); ɓe ‘to shoot something with
an arrow’, also ‘to pick something small’, e.g. peanuts, berries
ma ‘woman’; mum (3M pronoun); mí ‘what’
mbìr ‘milk’; mbok ‘between’; mbə̀ ‘to come’The evidence that /mb/ is a single consonant rather than a consonant cluster
is provided by syllable separation in word-internal position. For example, theErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-332chapter 2first-person plural pronoun nambà is sometimes reduced to mbà, but not bà,
in rapid speech.
The palatalized bilabial /by/ occurs in the borrowing byek ‘slave’ (from Mundang byàk; Elders 2000: 454), where palatalization is probably triggered by the
front vowel /e/.
2.2
Labio-dental Fricatives: v, f
The voiceless labio-dental fricative /f/ contrasts with its voiced counterpart
/v/:
/f/
/v/
/fy/fi ‘waist’; fáŋ ‘to repeat’; fol ‘to slaughter’; fun ‘boule’, ‘food’
vìʔ ‘to lose, to get lost’; vun ‘mouth’; vari ‘road, route’
fyek fyek ‘small holes’; bàfyeke ‘corn, maize’2.3
Alveolar Stops and Nasals: t, d, ɗ, n, nd, ny
In the alveolar place of articulation, Pévé distinguishes among the alveolar
stops /t/ and /d/, the glottalized alveolar stop /ɗ/, the alveolar nasal /n/, the
palatalized nasal /ny/, and the prenasalized voiced alveolar /nd/:
/t/
/d/
/ɗ/
/n/
/nd/ti ‘to eat’; tà ‘to go’; tan ‘trail, trace (Noun)’; ‘behind’; tám ‘today’
də̀ ‘go’, future marker; dàn ‘word’; dàm ‘to sew’, ‘to descend from/get out
of’
ɗam ‘to build (a house)’; ɗe ‘to call, to name’
ne ‘to give’; na (1SG subject pronoun; impersonal pronoun); ni (proximal demonstrative)
ndoʔ ‘to end, to finish’; ndày (3PL subject pronoun); nde ‘to fall’The palatalized nasal /ny/ is considered underlying because it occurs before
both front and non-front vowels:
/ny/nyem ‘song’; nyã ‘earth’, nyĩ ‘soul’, nyə̃ tu ‘sperm’ (there are no instances
of ny followed by o or u)As stated above, the surface palatalized nasal may be triggered by a following
front vowel.
2.4
Alveolar Affricates: ts, dz, dʒ
The voiceless alveolar affricate /ts/ contrasts with the alveolar stop /t/, above,
the alveolar fricative /s/, and the voiced alveolar affricates /dz/ and /dʒ/:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3phonology/ts/
/tʃ/33tsar ‘to wake up, to get up’; tsává ‘courtyard’; tsoɓ ‘to sell’; ‘purchase’ (N);
tsú NEG
tʃop ‘primary, first of all’There is free variation in labialization of the alveolar affricate before a round
vowel in an open syllable, e.g. tsóhoʔ ~ tswóhoʔ ‘eight’. This variation is not
apparent in the closed syllable: tsoɓ ‘to trade’, ‘purchase’ (N), but not *tswoɓ.
The alveolar affricate /dz/ contrasts with the voiceless /ts/ and the palatoalveolar affricate /dʒ/:
/dz/dzàk ‘to chop, cut into pieces’, dzòk ‘to pound grain using a mortar and
pestle’, dzúk ‘to despise’The palato-alveolar affricate /dʒ/ is considered underlying because it may be
followed by a non-front, non-high vowel:
/dʒ/dʒí ‘to tend, to watch over’; dʒek (a small melon with white flesh); dʒwə̀
‘chief’In some cases there is free variation between the non-palatalized and palatalized forms, as in dzìku vs. dʒìku ‘very (much)’. Before a mid front vowel, an
additional palatal glide may be inserted between the palato-alveolar affricate
and the vowel, as in dʒyew ‘tent, shelter’, dʒyèw ‘to tie something’.
The voiced prenasalized affricate /ndz/ contrasts with /dz/:
/ndz/ ndzar ‘sister’, ndzə̀r ‘brother’, ndzur ‘cousin’; ndzor (a wild vine-like
plant)
The voiced prenasalized affricate is palatalized before a high front vowel, as in
ndʒike ‘iron’, and optionally palatalized before a high back vowel, as in ndzuku
~ ndʒuku (a type of mouse).
In some instances a labialized affricate appears to contrast with the nonlabialized affricate, e.g. tswə ‘to chew something crunchy’ vs. tsú (negative
marker); dʒwə ‘chief’ vs. dzùk ‘to despise’. It is likely that the labial feature is
a result of an underlying round vowel following the affricate. This hypothesis
is supported by the forms ndzú ‘to chew something crunchy’ in Lamé (Sachnine 1982: 437) and Dari (Wambadang p.c.) and the Lamé form dùwà ‘religious
leader’ (Sachnine 1982: 355). Moreover, since there appear to be no contrastive
forms *tsə and *dʒə in Pévé, the labialized alveolar affricates are not considered
phonemic.","[47, 48, 49]"
"3MorphologyVerbal morphology in Pévé is limited to four categories: (a) tone changes coding
the perfective aspect, (b) parsing morphology (see chapter 3), (c) nomen agentis
prefixes (see chapter 5), which derive nouns from verbs, and (d) reduplication,
which is discussed in later chapters according to the functions encoded. Unlike
most Chadic languages described so far, Pévé has no means of coding the person, gender, or number of the subject (or any other participant) on the verb.
However, as shown in section 5 below, the choice of the verb itself can be a
means of coding singularity or plurality of the subject or object.
The following sections describe the morphological forms and functions
found in Pévé.
3.1
Perfective Aspect
The only typically verbal function that can be marked on the verb in Pévé is
the perfective aspect, marked by high tone on the first syllable of the verb. As
shown in chapters 8 and 9, all other tenses, aspects, and moods involve the
unmarked (also called the non-perfective) form of the verb along with markers outside the main verb. Therefore, only the perfective aspect is discussed
in this section. The function of the perfective aspect is described in chapter 8.
The tone of the non-perfective (unmarked) form of the verb is considered to
be the underlying tone. Most verbs have mid tone in the unmarked form. The
bisyllabic verb gewa ‘to return to another place’, for example, has underlying
mid tone in the citation form and in non-perfective forms:
(1) mum wə
gewa Garoua
3M IMPF return G.
‘he is returning to Garoua’
(2) mum də̀ gewa Garoua síw
3M FUT return G.
tomorrow
‘he will return to Garoua tomorrow’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-368chapter 4The perfective aspect is marked by high tone on the first syllable of the
verb:
(3) handày géwa Garoua si
3PL
return G.
ASSERT
‘they returned from Garoua’
A few verbs have underlying low tone, e.g. tà ‘to walk’, wàʔ ‘to want, to need’,
and də̀ ‘to go’:
(4) ta wə́
tà
3F IMPF walk
‘she is walking’
(5) ta də̀ tà
3F FUT walk
‘she will walk’
In the perfective aspect, the low-tone verb, like the mid-tone verb, has high
tone. Evidence for the perfective function is provided by use of the adverbial
kúm ‘yesterday’, which indicates that the event occurred before the time of
speech:
(6) Gwà tá lúmò kúm
kə́dàn tsoɓ keve
G. go market yesterday PURP buy fish
for ‘Gwa went to the market yesterday to buy fish’
An even smaller set of verbs has underlying high tone. Evidence for the underlying high tone is provided by the fact that the verb with high tone occurs in
non-perfective constructions:
(7) na wə́
dʒí
hu
1SG IMPF watch goat(s)
‘I’m watching the goats’
(8) à
də̀ dʒí
hu
2M.SBJV FUT watch goat(s)
‘go watch the goats!’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3verbs69Cf. the perfective form, which also has high tone. Note that the only means
of coding the perfective aspect is retention of the underlying high tone and the
absence of any other marks of tense or aspect:
(9) mum dʒí
hu
3M watch goat(s)
‘he watched the goat(s)’
Such verbs provide evidence that tone on the verb is underlying and that high
tone on the verb codes the perfective aspect.
3.2
Parsing Morphology
Parsing morphology involves adding a final vowel to the morpheme in phrasefinal position. The phrase-final morpheme can be a verb:
(10) Taú fól-ó
T. slaughter-FV
‘Tau slaughtered’
(11) vay wə́
tʃiʔ-i
child IMPF cry
‘the baby is crying’
Cf. the same verbs in phrase-internal position:
(12) Taú fól
ya nãw-á
T. slaughter cow-FV
‘Tau slaughtered the cow’
(13) ha tʃiʔ mi su
2M cry what Q
‘Why are you crying?’
Parsing morphology also applies to most other lexical and grammatical categories in Pévé (see chapter 3).","[83, 84, 85]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-334chapter 22.5
Alveolar Fricatives: s, z, ʃ, ʒ
Pévé distinguishes between the voiced and voiceless alveolar fricatives /s/ and
/z/:
/s/
/z/
/ʃ/
/sw/
/ʃw/sə́ (3F subject and object pronoun); sa ‘to spin (cotton)’; su (interrogative particle); sò ‘bone’; saɓ ‘large lance with a wide blade’
zə̀ ‘under(neath)’; zà ‘weed’ (N); zùʔ ‘mortar’ (for grinding); zu ‘bottom
part of something’
ʃìnè ‘field’; ʃyè ‘to fall (as in rain)’; ʃeʔe ‘tooth’; ʃẽw ‘to squat, to crouch’
swə ‘person, man’
ʃwe (an exclamation used when the speaker is disappointed by someone else’s behavior)The alveolar fricatives /s/ and /z/ are often palatalized before a front vowel, e.g.:
ʒi ‘fight’ (V), ‘play (a game)’, ‘war’; ʃinè ‘field’; ʃyen ‘to fall (like rain)’. Evidence
that these are conditioned forms is provided by free variants such as si or ʃi
(assertive marker), and by the fact that there appear to be no minimal pairs of
the type /z/ vs. /ʒ/ or /s/ vs. /ʃ/. In natural discourse, the palatalized fricative
may in turn be followed a palatal glide before a high or mid front vowel: ʒè or
ʒyè ‘river’; ʃem or ʃyem ‘foot’, ‘step’.
2.6
Glottal Stop: ʔ
In at least one instance, the word-initial glottal stop contrasts with the wordinitial vowel: ʔi ‘to insult’ vs. ì (2PL subjunctive subject pronoun). In word-final
position, the glottal stop contrasts with the voiceless velar stop (and other consonants):
dzòʔ
gaʔ‘to plant’; ‘to scoop up a paste’ vs. dzòk ‘to pound grain with a mortar
and pestle’
‘side’ vs. gàk ‘to be able’The primary evidence for the glottal stop as a phoneme is provided by a large
number of minimal pairs with word-final glottal stops vs. word-final vowels:
tʃiʔ
ʃeʔe
gã ́ʔ
soʔ
zuʔ‘to cry’ vs. tʃi ‘to kill’, ‘to weave’
‘tooth’; ‘egg’ (homonym) vs. ʃe ‘to fall, to rain’
‘broth made with cold water and grain’ vs. gã ‘brush, shrubs’
‘cold’ (ADJ) vs. sò ‘bone’
‘to pound (a grain)’ vs. zu ‘bottom of something (animate or inanimate)’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3phonology35At the normal rate of speech a word-final glottal stop is sometimes omitted,
as is the case with the adverbial sə́dayʔ in the following:
(1) mum gyɛ́wambə̀
sə́day
mum géwa
mbə sədayʔ
3M return
come two.days.later
‘He came back two days later.’
Evidence for the word-final glottal stop is that the glottal stop is retained when
the morpheme is followed by a final vowel (FV; see chapter 3):
(2) mum géwa mbə sədayʔ-a
3M return come two.days.later-FV
‘He came back two days later.’
An epenthetic glottal stop may precede a word-initial vowel to place emphasis on the word or morpheme that follows. The glottal stop may occur between
consecutive vowels, as in the example below:
(3) gewa ʔà
fãye
gewa à
faŋ
ye
return 2M.SBJV repeat PERM
‘“Go back again!”’
The epenthetic glottal stop with the emphatic function can also occur between
a word-final consonant and a word-initial vowel:
(4) ɛɛ kəri mə̀ní … mum ʔín ne nùm ndə́ naʔ-a ….
ɛɛ kəri mə̀ni mum ín ne nùm ndə́ naʔ-a ….
eh when
3M say ADP 3M.O like I.PRO-FV
‘When he told him that …’
2.7
Glottal Fricative: h
The contrast between the initial glottal fricative /h/ and an initial vowel is
found in a few lexical items:
hu ‘goat’ vs. ú ‘millet’
hoɓ ‘two’ vs. o ‘to ask’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-336chapter 2The glottal fricative also contrasts with the initial glottal stop:
hí (2PL subjunctive pronoun) vs. ʔi ‘to insult’
2.8
Velar Consonants: k, g, ŋ, ɣ
Pévé distinguishes among the velar stops /k/ and /g/, the velar nasal /ŋ/, and
velar fricative /ɣ/:
/k/
/g/
/ŋ/
/ɣ/ka ‘where’; kə (associative preposition); ku ‘fire’
gàk ‘to be able’; ge ‘to throw’; gú ‘tree’
ŋak ‘crowned crane’ (bird)
ɣaw ‘fight’ (N); ɣàr ‘to hurry’In word-final position, the velar nasal /ŋ/ contrasts with the alveolar nasal /n/:
tʃiriŋ
nàŋ‘deep’ vs. tʃin ‘to place, to put’
(2F object pronoun) vs. nàn (1SG object pronoun)The velar nasal may carry tone, as evidenced by the form hŋ́ , a variant of the
form hə́ŋ (2F indicative subject pronoun). In the form ŋ̀ , a variant of the 2F subjunctive subject pronoun ə̀ŋ, the velar nasal is syllabic and carries the low tone
of the underlying form:
(5) ŋ̀
làʔ sə́ tə̀
mbə̀ ye
2F.SBJV say 3F.O 3F.SBJV come PERM
‘(you) tell her she should come’
There are a few instances where /kw/ and /gw/ contrast with non-labialized
stops:
/kw/
/gw/kwá ‘thing’ vs. ka ‘where’
gwaʔ ‘then’ vs. gaʔ ‘side’Given that the labialized velar stops are rare in the language, it is likely that
/kw/ and /gw/ have their origins in a stop followed by a round vowel, as has
been posited for other labialized consonants. Support for this is provided by
free variants such go ~ gwaʔ ‘then’. However, given the contrasting pairs above,
the labialized velars are considered phonemic.","[49, 50, 51, 52]"

3chapter 3Distribution of Phrase-Final Forms3.1
Attested Phrase-Final Forms
In Pévé, a final vowel can be added to a morpheme whose underlying form ends
in a consonant, including a glide or a glottal stop. The added final vowel, glossed
‘FV’, is usually a copy of the preceding vowel of the morpheme to which the
vowel is added. The cardinal vowels /i, e, a, o, u/ all occur as added vowels in the
data base. The added vowel occurs with grammatical and lexical items of many
kinds, including nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and quantifiers:
(3) vay wə́
tʃiʔ-i
child IMPF cry
‘the baby is crying’
(4) à tsar fray riʔ-i
2M arise above already-FV
‘you’d better get up!’
(5) mum súk kə

1PL
water REL cold-cold-FV
‘we have very cold water’
(8) mum tá hayʔ bay um-u
3M go PREP friend 3M.POSS-FV
‘he went next to his friend’
The phrase-final added vowel carries the [±nasal] feature of the preceding
vowel:
(9) ta géwa lúmò ɓay ta pemãy-ã
3F return market CONJ 3F rest-FV
‘she came back from the market and rested’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3parsing morphology57A phrase-final vowel can be added to a morpheme that ends in a vowel followed by a glottal stop, evidence that the final glottal stop is underlying (see
chapter 2):
(10) ndáʔ nə
uráʔ-a
horse PROX black-FV
‘this horse is black’
(11) na wé nẽʔ-ẽ
1SG see hippopotamus-FV
‘I saw a/the hippopotamus’
There are certain forms that do not exhibit an alternation between an added
phrase-final vowel and the lack of an added vowel. A phrase-final vowel cannot
be added to a morpheme whose underlying form (identical with the citation
form) ends in a front or back vowel, as defined in chapter 2. The adposition ne,
the pronoun nù (2M.O), the adjective kĩ,́ and the nouns lúmò ‘market’ (Fulfulde)
and bə̀kà ‘morning’ all have underlying final back or front vowels and cannot
be followed by an additional final vowel:
(12) mum wə́
sə́ tsoɓ man ne-*e
3M IMPF 3F.O buy 1SG.O ADP-*FV
‘he is buying it for me’
(13) na ín dàn ne nù-*u

‘I told you something’
(14) ya nãw ki-*i
̃́ ̃́

‘the cow is small’
(15) Taú tá lúmò-*o
T. go market-*FV
‘Tau went to the market’
(16) Taú tá lúmò tám kə
bə̀kà-*a
T. go market today ASSC morning-*FV
‘Tau went to the market this morning.’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-358chapter 3Other forms that cannot be marked by the phrase-final vowel include forms
whose function is based on the material that follows. A preposition, for example, can function as a preposition only when followed by a noun. The associative preposition kə never occurs in phrase-final position:
(17) na tsú kə
ri
mí
1SG NEG ASSC time/space NEG
‘I don’t have time/space’
The same is true of the locative preposition wə ‘in, at, to’:
(18) na tá wə
Garoua
1SG walk PREP G.
‘I went to Garoua’
The imperfective marker wə́ carries the aspectual function only when it precedes a verb, and so cannot occur in phrase-final position:
(19) na wə́
dʒì (wa) Gwà
1SG IMPF wait PREP G.
‘I’m waiting for Gwà’
Similarly with the future tense marker də̀, which precedes the head verb:
(20) ta də̀ ge
ndoʔ sin
sə́
ta də̀ ge
ndoʔ sin
sàr ye
3F FUT finish work 3F.POSS near only
‘she will finish her work very soon’
3.2
Phrase-Final Vowel -a
The range of phrase-final vowel forms shown above suggests that the phrasefinal vowel itself does not have an underlying form. However, there is some
evidence that the phrase-final vowel has (or used to have) the underlying form
a. This is of particular interest because the word-final vowel à is part of the system of parsing morphology in Wandala (Frajzyngier 2012), a language remotely
related to Pévé.
As shown in chapter 2, the high central vowel ə in Pévé can be either
epenthetic or phonemic. A number of grammatical items have the underlying
form (CV)Cə (see chapter 2 for evidence that word-final ə can be found in both
underlying and citation forms):Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-359parsing morphology(21) ɓay Taobay nə

si
ASSERT
‘after tonight, she will finish her work’ [Note that tám ‘today’ has no final
vowel, despite its pre-pausal position. This provides further evidence that
the Pévé has phrase-final vowel addition, not phrase-internal vowel deletion.]
Forms ending in ə in isolation or in phrase-internal position may have a final -a
in phrase-final position, as illustrated below. There is no evidence that the final
a is underlying:
(24) ta tá hayʔ bay s-á
3F go PREP friend 3F.POSS-FV
‘she1 went beside her1,2 friend’
(25) na fáŋ mbə́
kə́dàn ve nda? n-a
1SG repeat come PURP take horse DED.M-FV
‘I came back to get the horse.’
Recall that the phrase-final vowel assimilates to the preceding vowel when the
underlying form of the item in phrase-final position ends in a consonant (see
chapter 2). When the item marked for phrase-final position has the underlying
form (CV)Cə, the phrase-final vowel -a replaces the underlying -ə and does not
assimilate to the preceding vowel:
(26) à
kat sowã mə náyʔ
kun-a (underlying form: kunə)
2M.SBJV look people REL DIST.M DED.PL-FV
‘Look at those people over there!’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-360chapter 3Cf. the phrase-internal form:

kunə
kə́dàn gi
tsoɓ
rum(-u)
1SG take calabash DED.PL PURP make purchase 3SG(-FV)
‘I took the calabashes in order to sell them.’
It remains to be explained why the word-final ə can be replaced by the phrasefinal marker a while other word-final vowels cannot (see kĩ ́‘small’, lúmò ‘market’
and others, above) cannot. It is possible that the final ə in forms such as sə́, nə,
kunə and others was originally epenthetic and evolved into the independent or
phrase-internal form after the grammaticalization of the phrase-final marker
a. It is also possible that phonological rules involving the high central ə differ
from those involving front and back vowels.
3.3
Vowel Addition vs. Vowel Deletion
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 show that the contrast between phrase-internal and phrasefinal forms is a product of phrase-final vowel addition rather than phraseinternal vowel deletion. Further evidence is provided by the fact morphemes
with an underlying final vowel—i.e., those that cannot undergo phrase-final
vowel addition—retain the underlying vowel in phrase-internal position. The
final vowel of the forms lúmò ‘market’, bə̀kà ‘morning’, and fə̀tà ‘sun, day’, for
example, cannot be deleted in phrase-internal position. This shows that the
final vowel of these words is underlying and that the alternation between final
vowel and lack of a final vowel is a matter of phrase-final vowel addition, not
phrase-internal vowel deletion or reduction:
(28) Taú tá lúmò/*lúm tám-á
T. go market
today-FV
for ‘Tau went to the market today’ (or any meaning)
(29) mum tá lúmò tám kə
bə̀kà/*bə̀k si
3M go market today ASSC morning ASSERT
for ‘he went to the market this morning’
(30) fə̀tà/*fə̀t məsín
day
other
for ‘once upon a time …’
An additional piece of evidence for phrase-final vowel addition as opposed to
phrase-internal vowel deletion is provided by the fact that a final vowel can be
added to a borrowed proper noun whose isolated form ends in a consonant:

(32) ta tá hayʔ bay Erin-i
3F go PREP friend E.-FV
‘she went next to Erin’s friend’
In short, evidence that phrase-internal forms are not products of final vowel
deletion is provided by the fact that some morphemes have a final vowel in both
phrase-internal and phrase-final position and that some phrase-final forms
have a final vowel that does not occur in the citation form.","[71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3311adjunct phrases and clausesThe modifier dʒuk ‘very, much’, also clause-final, has a similar function.
Again, its scope is the entire clause:

squirrel FOC know play gàyʔ much-FV
‘Squirrel knew how to play gàyʔ very well.’
The modifier tʃet ‘all’ also occurs in clause-final position. When preceded by a
noun, tʃet appears to modify the noun:
(56) tám tà gí tsoɓ mbìr tʃettʃet-e
today 3F sold milk all.all-FV
‘today she sold all the milk’ (emphasis on ‘all’)
However, tʃet may be separated from the noun by a temporal adverbial. This
suggests that the scope of tʃet, like that of ɓáyrúm, is the entire clause (this cannot be captured in the English translation):
(57) tà gí tsoɓ mbìr tám tʃet-tʃet-e
3F sell
milk today all-all-FV
‘she sold all the milk today’ (not ‘she sold milk all day’)
The adverbial tʃet can also be separated from the noun it modifies by a possessive pronoun:
(58) mum ti ɬew um
tʃet-tʃet-e
3M ate meat 3M.POSS all-all-FV
‘he ate all his meat’
The scope of tʃet as an adjunct that modifies the entire clause is confirmed by
the fact that tʃet follows the assertive marker si, which is usually clause-final or
followed only by a negative or interrogative marker:Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3312chapter 21(59) mum ti ɬew um

tʃet-tʃet-e
3M ate meat 3M.POSS ASSERT all-all-FV

The form tʃet-tʃet contrasts with the form tʃẽʔtʃẽʔ, which codes repetition of the
event. Its position may be clause-initial or clause-final:

S.
make work good all like M. always-FV
‘Səray always works as hard as May’
The adverbial kerker ‘always, all the time’ also codes repetition or duration of
the event. Use of the perfective aspect indicates that the event was bounded:
(62) vay bá(r) dùkrí kerker
kə tʃiʔ-i

‘the baby cried all night’
Recurrence of an event can be coded by the noun syem ‘foot, leg, step’ followed

3M NEG 3F.O buy never NEG
‘he never buys it’

"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3chapter 3Parsing Morphology
1IntroductionMany lexical and grammatical morphemes in Pévé show an alternation between the phrase-internal form and the phrase-final form, which consists of
the phrase-internal form with an added final vowel. A phrase-final vowel can
be added to any morpheme whose citation form ends in a consonant, provided
that grammatical rules allow the morpheme to occur in phrase-final position.
A morpheme that has no meaning unless it is followed by additional material
does not undergo phrase-final vowel addition.
As illustrated below, use of the phrase-final form of a given morpheme tells
the listener that the morpheme is the final component of the grammatical constituent to which it belongs; in other words, that the constituent contains all
of the information that the speaker wishes to include, regardless of whether
the constituent is grammatically complete. A morpheme in phrase-internal
form, in contrast, tells the listener to expect more material within the same
constituent. With respect to final vowel alternation, the terms ‘phrase-internal
form’ and ‘phrase-final form’ are used for simplicity. The term ‘parsing morphology’ refers to the alternation between phrase-internal forms and phrase-final
forms and the functions they perform.","[69, 70]"
"2Conditional ConstructionsThe conditional construction in Pévé, as in many languages, describes a certain
state or event (protasis) and the potential outcome or implications of the state
or event (apodosis). The conditional protasis clause, which describes the initial state or event, is marked by the conditional marker làʔ and by use of the
assertive marker si in clause-final position. The marker làʔ, no doubt derived
from the verb làʔ ‘to say’, may occur immediately before or after the subject of
the protasis, with no apparent distinction. Tense and aspect are marked in the
conditional protasis and apodosis by the same means used in the independent
clause:

2M COND FUT come ASSERT 2M.SBJV hold spear 2M.POSS hand
‘If [you] come here, hold your spear (in your hand).’
As shown in chapter 9, the assertive marker at the end of a simple sentence indicates that the speaker wants the hearer to believe in the reality of the event or
state described by the sentence. In the conditional construction, the assertive
marker at the end of the protasis clause advises the hearer to believe that the
event or state described in the protasis has occurred, will occur, or may occur.
The use of the assertive marker in the conditional clause is explained by the fact
that consequences expressed in the apodosis will have no bearing if the hearer
does not believe in the truth or reality of the protasis. The consequences of the
protasis are described in the apodosis clause, which has the same form as the
corresponding simple sentence:

As shown in the preceding examples, there is no dedicated marker of the conditional apodosis. There are, however, two types of conditional apodosis clauses:
One that is followed by the assertive marker si and one that is not followed by
the assertive marker. Both are described below.
When the apodosis involves the auxiliary verb gàk ‘can, be able to’ followed
by another verb, the apodosis is followed by the marker si:
(9) na làʔ
mbə́ síi
na gàʔ əm zaʔ si
na làʔ

1SG COND come ASSERT 1SG can 3M.O find ASSERT

si
mum gàk pemãy
3M COND finish work 3M.POSS ASSERT 3M can rest
si
ASSERT
‘if he has finished his work, he can rest’ [gé ndoʔ ‘throw end’]
The marker si may also follow the apodosis when the protasis describes a
state or event that did not occur. In the next example, evidence that the event
described by the protasis did not occur is provided by use of the counterfactual
(CF) marker kə̀zə́ (see chapter 19) in the protasis clause. This provides evidence
that the assertive marker indicates the speaker’s desire that the hearer accept
an ‘if X, then Y’ connection between the protasis and the apodosis rather than
the speaker’s belief in the real-world state or event:
(11) mum làʔ
gbə̀gbóŋ kə̀zə́ ɓáyrúm sí,
kà mum kóra sìnè
3M COND strong CF much ASSERT then 3M leave field
nə̀
ndóʔ dáy sí
DED.M finish arrive ASSERT
‘if he were very strong, he would have finished the field earlier’
Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3262chapter 18The marker si does not follow an apodosis that is marked for the future tense.
The explanation for this is that use of the future tense indicates the speaker’s
belief that an event or state will occur, so use of the assertive marker would
result in reduplication:
(12) handày làʔ
wə́
gí sin wándʒì sí
handày də̀ ndóʔ
3PL
COND IMPF do work together ASSERT 3PL
FUT finish
ʃìnè rúm
gáʔrí *si
field 3M.POSS quickly ASSERT
‘if they are working together, they will finish their field faster’
For the same reason si cannot follow the independent future clause:
(13) mum də̀ gewa Garoua síw
*si
3M FUT return G.
tomorrow *ASSERT
for ‘he will return from Garoua tomorrow’
The assertive marker also does not occur when the apodosis is marked for
another modality, such as obligation or permission. The fact that the assertive
marker does not co-occur with other modality markers adds to the evidence
that si itself is a marker of modality, since markers of different modalities cannot occur in the same clause. The marker si does not occur when the apodosis
is marked with the clause-initial obligation marker sáy. The following sentence
expresses the speaker’s doubt in the subject’s arrival:
(14) mum làʔ
də̀ mbə̀ kətáʔ si sáyʔ na gíláʔ tú
3M COND FUT come now REL OBLIG 1SG ready body
rìn-ì
*si
1SG.POSS-FV ASSERT
‘if he comes, I must be ready’
The marker si also does not occur when the apodosis clause is marked for the
subjunctive mood, as indicated by use of the subjunctive (SBJV) pronoun (see
chapter 9):
(15) la?
hí wə́
də̀ lumo si,

1SG.POSS ASSERT
‘if you (PL) are going to the market, wait for me’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3263conditional and temporal constructionsThe key components of the conditional construction are thus the conditional marker làʔ preceding or following the subject of the protasis, the
assertive marker si at the end of the protasis, and the stand-alone nature of
the apodosis.","[275, 276, 277, 278, 279]"
"2Identificational PredicationAn identificational predication, as defined in the present work, tells the hearer
how to identify an entity that is visible to the hearer or has been previously
mentioned in discourse (cf. Moltmann 2013). The form of the identificational
clause in Pévé is Noun (Modifier) na, where na functions as an impersonal pronoun. This function is similar to that of the English forms ‘that’, ‘this’, ‘those’,
‘these’ or ‘it’ in identificational clauses (note the translations below), albeit the
Pévé predication does not code distinctions in number or proximity. The impersonal pronoun na is used in contrast with the copula kè (see sections 3 and 4,
below).
An identificational predication may consist solely of the subject noun followed by the impersonal pronoun na:
(1) tʃime na
sheep I.PRO
‘it/that is a sheep’ (the sheep is visible)© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020 | doi:10.1163/9789004410053_012Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3196chapter 11(2) mléyʔ
Taobày na
mum láʔ i
Taobày na
3M say COMP T.
I.PRO
‘He said it is/was Taobay.’ (Taobay was previously mentioned)
Without the clause-final na, the construction cannot serve as an independent
clause:
(3) ndáʔ sə́
horse 3F
‘her horse …’
(4) mléyʔ
Taobày
mum láʔ i
Taobày
3M say COMP T.
‘He said Taobay …’
The head noun may be followed by a modifying word or phrase, which precedes
the impersonal pronoun:
(5) ndáʔ sə́
na
horse 3F.POSS I.PRO
‘it/that is her horse’
(6) ndáʔ uráʔ-a na
horse black-FV I.PRO
‘it/that is a black horse’
(7) ya naw kunə mə handay na
cow PL REL 3PL
I.PRO
‘those cows are theirs’
Again, the phrase without the impersonal pronoun cannot function as an independent clause:
(8) ndáʔ sə́
horse 3F.POSS
‘her horse …’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3197verbless and copular predications(9) ndáʔ uráʔ-a
horse black-FV
‘the black horse …’
(10) ya naw kunə mə handay
cow PL REL 3PL
‘their cows …’
While the English translations may suggest that na is a copular verb, there are
several pieces of evidence that na is not a verb in Pévé. First, in a verbal clause
the verb immediately follows the subject, while the form na occurs only in
sentence-final position. Second, there is no means of marking na for tense or
aspect, functions that are overtly marked in verbal phrases. Third, the impersonal pronoun na can function as the object of a preposition, a function that
does not apply to verbs:
(11) ha tʃì mi ndə́ nə
su?
2M cry what like I.PRO Q
‘The squirrel asked him: Why are you crying like that, friend?’
The form na bears resemblance to a number of other grammatical morphemes
in Pévé, including the adposition ne, the masculine determiner and postrelative marker nə, the proximal determiner ni, and a number of object pronouns in the perfective set. The widespread functions of na and its similarity
to a number of other grammatical morphemes in Pévé provide material for further study.","[211, 212, 213]"
"3Temporal ConstructionsThe temporal construction describes the temporal relationship between the
event or state described by the protasis clause and the event or state described
by the apodosis clause. While the conditional construction refers to a sequence
of events, the temporal construction may or may not indicate a cause-andeffect relationship between the protasis and the apodosis.
In most cases the temporal protasis clause is marked by the clause-initial
phrase kəri (mə̀ni), derived from the associative preposition kə followed by the
noun ri ‘time, place’, the relative marker mə, and the resumptive pronoun ni (see
chapter 17). For simplicity the phrase kəri məní is usually glossed ‘when’. The
end of the protasis clause may be unmarked or may be marked by the clausefinal assertive marker si. Like the conditional apodosis, the temporal apodosis
has the same form as the corresponding independent clause.
A temporal protasis clause referring to a single event usually begins with
the phrase kəri mə̀ni. A temporal protasis clause in the perfective aspect, as
marked by high tone on the verb, may be followed by the marker si, indicating the speaker’s belief that the event of the protasis took place:
(16) kəri məni handày gí sin ndày
ndóʔ wə
ʃìnè si
when
3PL
do work 3PL.POSS finish PREP field ASSERT
handày géwa tá só
ndày-a
3PL
return go house 3PL.POSS-FV
‘when they finished their work in the field, they went back home’
Use of the assertive marker after the perfective protasis is apparently optional,
as indicated by the following elicited and natural discourse examples:
(17) kərí mə̀ni só
vé kú handày wúr
kə
né
when
house take fire 3PL

(19) kəri mə̀ni handày kaw
num handày faŋ
mbə so
when
3PL
catch, arrest 3M.O 3PL
return come home
‘when they arrested him, they came back home’
Use of the unmarked aspect in the protasis indicates that the event was ongoing at the time of the event described by the apodosis. The unmarked aspect in
the following example is indicated by use of the underlying verb forms faŋ and
da, with no markers of tense or aspect:
(20) kəriməni mum fã
da …. mum ndyéwa kə … yii
kəri məni mum faŋ
da…. mum ndewa kə … yii
when
3M repeat go
3M meet ASSC squirrel
‘On his way back home he ran into Squirrel.’
A protasis clause referring to a repeated event is marked by the adverbial dáŋʔ
‘all, every’ at the end of the protasis clause. The assertive marker si, if present,
precedes the adverbial marker:
(21) kəriməmlàʔ
ʔwã ý gàyʔ sì
dáŋʔ mum pár
kəri məni mum làʔ
ʔwáy dáŋʔ sì

‘Each time he won the game, he took a playing piece (vay gayʔ) and hit a
guinea fowl on the head with it.’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3265conditional and temporal constructionsUnlike the conditional apodosis, the temporal apodosis is rarely followed by
si. This provides further evidence that the final si in the conditional apodosis
indicates the speaker’s certainty with respect to the relationship between the
event/state of the protasis and the event/state of the apodosis rather than the
speaker’s certainty that an event/state actually occurred:
(22) kəri məni ta gé ndoʔ sin sə́

‘when she finished her work, she rested’

‘When I got home I was very tired.’
In elicited sentences of the same type the use of si is considered unacceptable
in the temporal apodosis:
(24) kəri məni handày gí sin ndày
ndóʔ wə

3PL

(25) kəri məni ta gé ndoʔ sin sə́

DEM REL 3F finish work 3F.POSS 3F rest *ASSERT
for ‘when she finished her work, she rested’
In all of the examples above the event or state described by the apodosis immediately follows the event or state described by the protasis. When there is a
temporal gap between the events of the protasis and the apodosis, the protasis may be marked by the adverbial dayna ‘after’ in place of the form kəri
(‘at the time of’). The form mə̀ni (Relative marker + Resumptive pronoun) is
retained:

point in time, the marker kəri may be followed by the possessive pronoun rùm
rather than the marker mə̀ni. The possessive pronoun refers to a specific point
in time that has been described in previous discourse:

‘At that point Monitor Lizard headed back, departed.’ (Monitor Lizard’s

When the event of the protasis has already occurred at a specific point in time,
the apodosis may be followed by the assertive marker:

clause that sets the condition or time frame for the apodosis clause. The conditional protasis is marked by the morpheme làʔ, corresponding to ‘if’, either
before or after the subject noun or pronoun, along with the assertive marker sí
at the end of the protasis. The temporal protasis, in contrast, is marked by one
of a number of temporal expressions, the most common of which is kəri mə̀ni
‘when’. Distinctions coded in temporal protasis clauses include completion of
the event before the apodosis, the ongoing nature of the event before or during
the apodosis, a specific point in time, and perhaps others. There is no dedicated
marker of the conditional or temporal apodosis, both of which have the same
form as the corresponding independent clauses. The conditional apodosis may
be followed by the assertive marker si, provided the apodosis is not marked forErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3conditional and temporal constructions267any other modality or for the future tense. The use of the assertive marker in
the temporal protasis appears to be optional, and there few instances of the
assertive marker in the temporal apodosis.","[279, 280, 281, 282, 283]"
"Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3the pévé language3The Pévé culture is historically semi-nomadic, with the population circling
through the Pévé regions in both Cameroon and Chad according to the season.
Most Pévé people support themselves through hunting, farming, and ranching. Much hunting is conducted in the Réserve Forestiére et Animaliére de
la Bouba-Ndjida, a forest and animal preserve in the Northern province of
Cameroon, bordering on Chad. According to Wambadang, the areas of Chad
and Cameroon where Pévé is spoken can be divided into three zones: The Pévé
zone, to the north and west of the Bouba-Njida reserve and encompassing parts
of both Cameroon and Chad; the Dzəbao zone, to the south and east of the
reserve and also extending into both Cameroon and Chad; and the Herdé zone,
to the northeast of the reserve and within the borders of Chad (see section
2.3). The Pévé zone is the most populated of the three zones in Chad. Speakers
throughout the three zones have long been in contact with the unrelated languages Mundang (Niger-Congo), Fulfulde (Niger-Congo; also called Fula, Fulbe
or Fulani), and French (via Mundang). Herdé, identified by Ethnologue as a
Pévé dialect, is in Wambadang’s view a pidgin variety of Pévé, as is Dzəbao. The
other component of the pidgins is Mesmé, like Pévé a member of the Masa
branch of Chadic, which is chiefly spoken to the east of the Pévé zone (see Fischer 1980). Wambadang identifies Gumadji (the name of a village in Chad, also
known as Gumaji or Goumadji) as a dialect similar to both Herdé and Dzəbao.
The village where Gumadji is spoken is close to Herdé, and Dzəbao tends to be
confused with both dialects (see further discussion below).
Wambadang considers Pévé, Dari, and Doué to be mutually comprehensible
dialects of the same language. The differences between Dari and Pévé lie primarily in tone, and even child speakers of the two dialects can understand each
other. The Dari dialect, named after the Dari village in southwestern Chad, is
spoken in the villages of Sinassi and Vaimba in North Cameroon, which neighbor on the Bouba-Ndjida reserve and are not far from the village of Djibao, the
site of Sachnine’s research. The Dari village in Chad is the dwelling place of the
traditional and administrative chief of the Canton Dari, itself a member of the
sub-prefecture of Lamé. Lamé is both a town name and the name of the most
widely spoken language in the area. One point of confusion is that the town of
Lamé also happens to be the center of Pévé leadership (chefferie), whose leader
(chef superieur) lives in Lamé and speaks Pévé.
Cooper 1984, an adaptation of Sachnine 1982, volume 2, that focuses on the
Dari dialect, shows considerable overlap between the Dari and Pévé lexicons.
The most significant difference between the two dialects is that tone in Dari
carries a variety of grammatical functions, such as future tense, imperfective
aspect, the locative function and the modifying function, while the same functions in Pévé are marked by free grammatical morphemes and the relative orderErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-34chapter 1of constituents. The two dialects remain mutually understandable, with the
chief difference being the functions of tone.
A further complication in the nomenclature is that Pévé is not just the name
of a language and a tribe but is also the name of a clan within the Pévé tribe. Certain clans are excluded from the Pévé tribe even though the clan members are
speakers of Pévé. There are five major Pévé clans: daw wãy (‘children of Wãy’),
to which Wambadang belongs; daw tau (‘children of Tau’); daw kəɗa (‘children
of Kəɗa’); daw djudjoa (‘children of Djudjoa’), the family of the current grand
chief; and daw fəta (‘children of Fəta’). Jwə Lawtu, the chief of the clan daw
djudjoa, died in February 2016, and his son has since been chosen as chief. The
chiefdom cycles from one clan to the next in the order shown above, depending on the chief’s performance and the availability of a successor. If a chief is
found to be irresponsible, the chiefdom may be passed to the next clan in line.
Clan membership is handed down through the paternal line, and no woman
can serve as a chief. If a chief is deemed to be a good leader, the next chiefdom
will be handed down to his son. If the deceased chief does not have a grown
son or any son at all, the chiefdom will go to the chief’s brother. Members of
clans outside of the five listed above have no chance at being chief, but they
are allowed to perform Pévé cultural practices such as circumcision (see below)
and may also serve as courtiers to the chief. For more on the history of the Pévé
chiefdom in Lamé, see Lami 1930–1940.
The primary cultural distinctions among Pévé and other clans, as well as
other tribes, include whether or not circumcision is required, whether or not
polygamy is allowed, and whether or not there is intermarriage between clans
and tribes. Circumcision is an important part of the Pévé culture, which holds
the belief that without circumcision a man is impure. The Pévé also practice
polygamy, with no limit to the number of wives a man may have. Traditionally, the more wives a man has the more important he is, but this is starting to
change, in part because the required dowry or ‘bride price’ has risen over time.
In the old days a bride could be purchased with five or six cattle, but with the
advent of European influence and wider commerce the price is much higher
and is paid with more cattle, cash, goats, food, and beer.
As stated above, Lamé is classified in Ethnologue as a dialect of Pévé. The
term Lamé likely has its origin in the unrelated Fulfulde language, spoken
by the nomadic Fulani people from the Middle-East and North Africa who
helped spread Islam throughout western and parts of central Africa from 900
to 1900A.D. According to oral history shared by Pévé elders and confirmed in
Abdoullaye and Eldridge 1979, the word Lamé is derived from the word laami,
the past-tense form of the Fulfulde verb laamugo ‘reign, be in the throne’. The
Fulani people are said to have used the term ɓe laami ‘they already have a chief-Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3the pévé language5dom’ upon arriving in the Pévé area, indicating that they found the Pévé chiefdom to be well structured. This would explain why the capital of the Pévé area
now bears the name Lamé, though it was once called Pévé. It is said that at one
time there were only two chiefdoms in the area: the chiefdom of Pévé in Lamé
and the Fulani chiefdom of Yola, now part of the Adamawa state in Nigeria. It
is possible that other chiefdoms existed but were less structured than those of
the Pévé and Fulani peoples, and it is also possible that the notion of only two
chiefdoms was promoted by the Fulani who came from Yola along with Islam.
In the past, the Pévé people, called Lamé by the Fulani, viewed themselves as
more independent than other communities because of their well-organized
chiefdom and the practice of circumcision.
Despite the lack of a genetic linguistic relationship, the Pévé and Mundang
peoples have many things in common, including shared clans and shared chiefs
as well as intermarriage between Pévé and Mundang (Wambadang’s wife is
Mundang). Pévé and Mundang also share some linguistic features, probably
due to centuries of language contact. These features include many lexical items
and the use of high tone on the verb as a means of coding perfective aspect.
Pévé also shares lexical items with related Chadic languages spoken near the
Pévé region. For example, Pévé and Masa have a number of similar basic lexical items, e.g. ku ‘fire’ in Pévé vs. kuda in Masa (transcribed as kù in Melis 1999:
178); and fun ‘food, boule’ (a common type of bread in Africa) in Pévé vs. funa
‘boule’ in Masa (transcribed as fù in Melis 1999: 101). However, speakers of the
two languages are culturally distant and intermarriage is rare. In Wambadang’s
view the Pévé dialects Herdé and Dzəbao are closer to Mesmé than to Pévé.
According to recent surveys conducted by Wambadang and colleagues, the
current number of Pévé speakers in Chad and Cameroon is 80,000 or more.
While many Pévé have crossed the border from Chad into Cameroon since
the 1980s due to the war in Chad and the development of cotton cultivation
in Cameroon, the Pévé population in both countries is thriving. The border
between Chad and Cameroon is open, and efforts by Wambadang and others to
unite Pévé speakers from both countries continue to be successful (see below).
In oral history the name ‘Pévé’ is said to stem from the noun pé ‘valley’, possibly referring to the Marrakesh valley of Morocco, and the Pévé verb ve, which
has the meaning ‘to take, to grab’ and also the meaning ‘to convene, to get along
well’. One possible historical account is that the Pévé people were long ago
chased away from the Nile region, where the Pévé culture may have originated,
and forced to emigrate to Marrakesh, where they were taken in by the Fulani
people because the two cultures got along very well. Another account is that the
Pévé people ‘grabbed’ (vé) some of the Fulani people of Marrakesh and brought
them back to the Pévé region.","[18, 19, 20, 21]"
"3Existing Works on the Pévé LanguageRodney Venberg, a Lutheran pastor and missionary who spent 18 years living
among the Pévé people and spent a total of 31 years in the republics of Chad
and Cameroon, has made important contributions towards describing the Pévé
language. Prior to Venberg’s arrival in 1966 there was no writing system for Pévé.
While living in Bissi Keda in the Republic of Chad, Venberg worked with native
speakers of Pévé to develop a phonetic writing system for Pévé speakers. The
system was used to translate the New Testament into Pévé (Venberg et al. 1985).
Venberg has published an analysis of Pévé phonology (Venberg 1975) and has
written a sketch of Pévé syntax (Venberg 1971, ms., 7pp.) and a short study of
the use of pronouns in Pévé (Venberg (ms.), 8pp.). Most of Venberg’s examples
and analyses were confirmed by the work of the present authors and provided
a very useful background for further analysis and exploration.
Jungraithmayr 1978 is a comparative study of dialects, including Pévé, that
are described as belonging to the Zimé cluster (Dari, Herdé, Ngeté, Mesmé and
more). The study, which focuses on the coding of perfective aspect vs. other
aspects, contains a list of indicative subject pronouns described as belonging
to ‘Pévé proper’. These forms correspond to those provided by Wambadang for
the present work, as do forms that mark the contrast between the perfective
aspect, marked by high tone on the verb, and the imperfective aspect, in which
the verb carries the underlying tone. Cooper 1984, a Zimé-French lexicon based
on the Zimé dialect Dari, is useful for comparative purposes and also for names
of wildlife and illustrations of basic cultural activities.
Sachnine 1976, 1978 and 1982 focus on vún dzəpàò (elsewhere referred to as
Dzəbao or Vún Dzəbao), a dialect of Lamé. In Sachnine’s works, the term vún
dzəpàò appears to be used interchangeably with the term Lamé. Given that Eth-Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-38

to Lamé, Wambadang states that these are forms from
the dialect he refers to as Vún Dzəbao.nologue and other sources have identified Lamé as a dialect of Pévé, one would
expect considerable overlap between Dzəbao and Pévé. However, parts of the
Dzəbao texts cited in Sachnine’s works are incomprehensible to Pévé speakers,
indicating that the overlap between Pévé and Dzəbao is limited. While Pévé,
as described in this work, and Lamé/Dzəbao, as described in Sachnine’s work,
do share many lexical items (though often with significant phonological differences), certain fundamental aspects of the two languages/dialects are quite different. For example, while the perfective aspect in Pévé is marked by high tone
on the verb, the perfective aspect (accompli) in Lamé/Dzəbao is marked by low
tone on the verb (Sachnine 1982: 46). Certain functions of the high-frequency
associative preposition kə in Pévé appear to be marked in Lamé/Dzəbao by
the marker ʔá, which is not attested in Pévé. Pronoun forms also differ significantly between Pévé and Lamé/Dzəbao, as shown in the subject pronoun
chart above (other pronoun forms also show significant differences, as shown
in chapter 6).
Given the fundamental role of pronouns in the languages, the differences
between pronouns in Pévé and pronouns in Lamé suggest that Pévé and
Dzəbao, referred to as Lamé in Sachnine’s works, represent two distinct languages rather than two dialects of the same language. Wambadang’s view of
Vún Dzəbao as a pidgin language based on Pévé and Mesme supports this
notion. Therefore, the current work draws on Sachnine’s work only for comparative purposes.","[23, 24]"
"4Function of Final Vowel AdditionThe function of the phrase-final added vowel in Pévé is to indicate that the
preceding morphological, lexical or grammatical unit is complete as far as the
speaker is concerned and should be interpreted as such. This can be viewed
as a subdomain within the domain of parsing morphology as described in Frajzyngier 2016b, though it differs from the function of parsing morphology in
Wandala.
In Pévé, phrase-final vowel addition is not determined by whether or not
the phrase, clause, or sentence with the final vowel is grammatically complete. In the following fragment, the first instantiation of the noun dzənàk
‘guinea fowl’ has a phrase-final vowel because the phrase kəri məní, which follows dzənàk-à, is always clause-initial. In other words, whatever precedes kəri
məní must be marked as phrase-final regardless of whether or not it could
function as a grammatically correct independent utterance. To put it another
way, adding the final vowel to dzənàk indicates that the word dzənàk should
be interpreted as a component of what has gone before and not what follows.
The second instantiation of dzənàk in the following example has no phrasefinal vowel. This can be explained by the fact that the demonstrative plural kunə
modifies dzənàk and so is part of the same unit, which may or may not be grammatically complete. Similarly, the final /ə/ in kunə is explained by the fact that it
is followed by the assertive marker si, which occurs only in phrase-final position
(recall that kunə becomes kun-a in phrase-final position). The phrase-internal
forms dzənàk and kunə thus tell the listener to expect more information withinErin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-362chapter 3the same unit of the utterance, while the form dzənàk-à tells the listener not to
expect more information within the same unit of the utterance:

‘Monitor Lizard went to sell tobacco in the village of the guinea fowls.
When he got to the village of the guinea fowls, he found them sitting

In the next example, the initial clause nambà gáyʔ vun ʒè nə (‘we stayed at
the riverbank’) is grammatically complete and could be used in isolation if
the form nə (/n/+epenthic vowel), which signals that the head noun refers to
a known entity, were changed to n-a. The absence of an added final vowel,
i.e., use of the form nə rather than n-a, tells the listener to expect more information about what has gone before. While the grammatical system of the
language determines whether a given grammatical unit is grammatically complete, the presence or absence of the phrase-final vowel determines whether
the hearer should expect more material in whatever grammatical construction
the speaker has chosen for conveying the information:

Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-363parsing morphologyA phrase-final vowel cannot be added to a morpheme when the material
that follows that morpheme is part of the same unit of the utterance, i.e., when
the material that follows can only be interpreted in the context of what has
gone before. In the next example, rùm (3M.POSS) has no added vowel because
the constituent that follows, namely fol-o ‘whitish’, cannot be interpreted in
the context of the material that follows. Adding a final vowel to rùm would
force the listener to view the form fol-o as the first component of the clause
that follows. The absence of a phrase-final vowel after fol would tell the listener to expect more information within the same constituent, but this would
be unfeasible since the next morpheme in the text is the preverbal (and usually
clause-initial) subject pronoun na:

‘He said his head is whitish; if I come, I can find him.’
The form fol ‘whitish’ does not require a final vowel in order to be grammatical,
since the clause wa rùm fol can be used in isolation.
In the following example, which also involves form rùm, the phrase-final
vowel -u indicates that the phrase that precedes it is complete and that what
follows is new material. Evidence for this is that the direct-speech phrase that
follows rùm-u can stand alone:

completeness is provided by the following example, where two noun phrases
have the same structure but the vowel can be added only after the speaker has
finished expressing the idea:
(38) handày tsóɓ ya nãw ɗáw(-*a) kə
hu ɗáw-a
3PL

‘they bought one cow and one goat’
Further evidence that absence of the phrase-internal vowel is not determined
by pre-pausal position is that a form without the added vowel can, and often
does, occur before a pause:
(39) mum gé də̀wã səlay ùm…
bruk

Interestingly, the lack of a phrase-final vowel where such a vowel would be
expected, e.g. at the end of an utterance that is grammatically and semantically complete, places emphasis on the final element of the constituent. This is
illustrated by the following elicited exchange:
Speaker 1:

‘Tau went to the market today’Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3parsing morphology65Speaker 2:
(43) Taú tá
lúmò tám
T. went market today
‘Tau went to the market today?’ (expressing disbelief)5ConclusionLexical and grammatical morphemes in Pévé show a formal alternation between the phrase-internal form, which is also the isolated form, and the phrasefinal form, which consists of the phrase-internal form with an added final
vowel. When a phrase-final constituent ends in a consonant in the isolated
form, the vowel added to the constituent in phrase-final position is a copy of
the vowel that precedes the final consonant. When the phrase-final constituent
ends in ə in the isolated form, the vowel ə is deleted in phrase-final position and
replaced by a, which may be the underlying form of the phrase-final vowel.
When the phrase-final constituent ends in a front or back vowel in the isolated
form, the underlying final vowel is retained and the phrase-final marker a cannot be used. A morpheme that has no meaning or function unless it is followed
by additional material does not undergo phrase-final vowel addition.
The contrast between the phrase-final form and the phrase-internal form
of a given morpheme tells the listener how to parse the utterance. When a
morpheme has an added final vowel, the morpheme is interpreted as the final
component of the constituent to which it belongs. The constituent does not
have to be grammatically complete, but it must contain all of the information
that the speaker intends to include in that constituent. When a morpheme is
in phrase-internal form, the listener expects more material within the same
constituent. If the next morpheme is also in phrase-internal form, the listener
expects still more material within the same constituent, and so on. While the
contrast between the phrase-final added vowel and the absence of an added
vowel in Pévé is not identical with the contrast between final vowel retention
and final vowel reduction/deletion in Wandala, both may be considered functions within the domain of parsing morphology.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81]"
"2ConsonantsTable 2 depicts the underlying consonants posited for Pévé in the present work.
Forms in brackets are those used in Venberg 1975. These forms are provided for
the reader’s benefit, as Pévé speakers are accustomed to the system developed
by Venberg in the 1960s for writing and reading Pévé (cf. Venberg 1985 and other
works).
The following sections provide evidence for the contrastive nature of
the proposed underlying consonants and describe the phonetic variants of
the underlying consonants. In most cases, the phonological contrast among
consonants is illustrated by word-initial forms. The distribution (initial, medial,
final, clusters) of various consonants is described in section 4 (phonotactics).
An underlying non-palatalized consonant is often palatalized when followed by a front vowel. This is a matter of free variation. An underlying palatalized consonant, such as /ʃ/ or /ʒ/, may be followed by the palatal glide /y/
before a high or mid front vowel. Only two palatalized consonants, /dʒ/ and
/ny/, are demonstrably underlying, as these are the only two palatalized consonants attested before a non-front, non-high vowel. Because palatalization of
an underlying non-palatalized consonant is a matter of free variation, the transcription of a given utterance may or may not depict palatalization.© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020 | doi:10.1163/9789004410053_003Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-330

also exists as a phonemic segment. For example, the underlying nasal segment
/n/ is often palatalized as /ny/ when followed by a front vowel, as evidenced
by the free variants ne ~ nye (an adposition, derived from the verb ‘give’, that
is used to mark the indirect object). The palatalized nasal /ny/ also has phonemic status because it occurs before both front and non-front vowels, as in nyem
‘song’ and nyã ‘earth’. Table 3 (below) shows phonetic consonant variants triggered by the following vowel.
The sections below, organized according to place and manner of articulation, provide examples of forms that are solely phonetic and forms that are
phonetic in some instances and phonemic in others.","[45, 46]"
