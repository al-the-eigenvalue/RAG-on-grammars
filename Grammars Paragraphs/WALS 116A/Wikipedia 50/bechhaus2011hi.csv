"6.6 Interrogative
There is no complete paradigm of the interrogative documentedin Old Nobiinalthough we would expect a fully developed paradigm if we look at Modern
Nobiin. According to Browne (2002:66), interrogative sentences can end in:
“i2™ person singular in all examples-haone example 1* person singular and 3™ person singular respectivelyThe suffixes follow the verb/predicate and personal endings. The question can be
introduced by an interrogative pronoun, such as is- or mina (for interrogativepronouns see 4.4). The terminal particle is optional and can be dropped.
(M. 9.1)
anki-min-na-iremember-NEG-2SGPRESIND-INTERROG
‘don’t you remember?’An interrogative pronoun can be placed at the beginning of the sentence or
clause, as in

of Lepsius.
It can be questioned whether the modern forms given by Werner actually developed from the Old Nobiin forms. Although they are undoubiedly similar, the
correspondences are by no means regular. The modern forms are evidently basedAlthough the interrogative pronoun is there it is not a wh-type question but a
yes-no one. Second person singular -i seems to be part of a regular interrogative
paradigm which is still present in Modern Nobiin (see below). Suffix -ha, however, listed by Browne under the same heading is not part of that paradigm. Inthe two instances documented, it follows interrogative pronouns, thus additionally marking wh-type questions, as in

2nd person and seems to correspond to the Old Nobiin form. The suffixes of the
interrogative are:

As Werner’s informants insisted, affirmative forms are never understood as questions but as strong
or emphatic affirmation. He regards a negative question with auxiliary min- asbasis for the affirmative construction which later underwent a semantic shift. The
underlying negative question, however, is presumably not ‘you’re not actually
beating?’, as Werner proposes, but ‘is it not that you are beating/aren’t you beating?’ which was reinterpreted as ‘you’re definitely beating’. In accordance with
Werner, Browne (ibid.) speaks of a ‘collapsed negative’ in Old Nobiin.

"21813. Appendix: Nubia in the Medieval Millennium —the Written SourcesThe Nubian Nile Valley is a region where intensive archaeological research has
been undertaken which is comparable only to its northern neighbor Egypt. Colin
Renfrew pointed out that these archaeological investigations also opened up new
possibilities for linguistic studies: “[...] while we cannot expect to find direct
evidence in the archaeological record for a specific prehistoric language or language group, we can indeed study processes of demographic and social change
which we may seek, however hypothetically, to correlate with language change
in those areas” (1987:264).
In the 6th century AD, the Christian historiographers began to write about the
northern Sudan. At first, their main subject was the conversion of Nubia to Christianity, later, they were interested in the unique phenomenon of a stable Christian
kingdom in the immediate neighborhood of Muslim Egypt. When the Muslim
historiographers and geographers began to write about the region not much later
they provided an abundance of information about geography, history, politics and
economy in the northern Sudan. In spite of the many Arab sources, however,
they conveyed only fragments about the political and social situation in Nubia
between the 9th and 15th century. For many scholars, the sources seemed, for
example, to prove that Christianity in Nubia and with it the Nubian kingdom
came to an end when the capital Dongola was conquered in 1323. As it is now
known, the kingdom of Dotawo, which is not mentioned in Arab sources, existec
at least until the end of the 15th century.
In the course of excavations at Qasr Ibrim, numerous Old Nobiin documents
have been found and edited which constitute the basis for the linguistic analyses
of Old Nobiin in this book. Although we are able to translate most of the written
remains, our knowledge of the context is often too inadequate to actually understand what the texts talk about. Adams (1996:244) states: “For the time being
they [the texts] may be said to enrich our picture of mediaeval Nubian life without significantly clarifying it, inasmuch as they raise perhaps as many questions
as they answer.” One of the problems Adams and others seem to find difficult to
deal with stems from the discrepancies between the content of Old Nobiin and
otherwrittensources.","[218, 219]"
"Thus, the construction of two original medieval Nubian nation states which
consisted of two “nations”, the Nobiin in Nobatia and the Dongolese/Kenzi
Makuria emerged which has never been seriously questioned.inThe assumption of two independent Nubian kingdoms is tased on rather
scanty evidence in the early medieval Christian sources. There is neither evidence from Nubia itself nor from Arab sources. As Arab sources undoubtedly
mention only one king of Nubia and only one capital and royal residence, Don-gola, scholars developed the concept of the unification of the alieged two kingdoms with Nobatia as the inferior party. Based on an inscription from 710 foundin Tafa on Nobadian soil which mentions King Merkurios of Dongola, Monneret
des Villard (1938) dates the unification to the early 8h century. Merkurios who iscelebrated as the “New Constantine” in Coptic sources is also regarded as the
unifier of the two kingdoms by Vantini (1981:72). Kirwan (1982) pointed out the
questions brought about by this dating. When the new Arab rulers of Egypt tried
to extend their sphere of control to the south in 642, they advanced as far as
Makuria without meeting any resistance on Nobatian ground. During the second
attempt to conquer Nubia ten years later, the invaders were also led directly to
Dongola, and after negotiations with the Nubian king, the famous baqt-treaty
was signed which legally bound all Nubians “from Aswan to the border of Alodia” (see Vantini 1975:640). As this formula excludes the possibility of two independent Nubian kingdoms at the time of the treaty Kirwan (ibid.), Crawford
(1951:23), Adams (1991:257), and others concluded that the unification took
place between 580, when John of Ephesus wrote his church history, and 642, the
year of the first Arab invasion.
That the established interpretation raises some questions is obvious even to
those who represent it in their scholarly work. Adam (1991:257) wonders how
the unification could be carried out without any bloodshed. “This becomes remarkable when we recall the warlike character of Nobadia two hundred years
earlier. The autocratic Nobadian chieftains buried at Ballana and Qustul, [...], donot impress us as the sort who would meekly hand over sovereignty to a rival
224kingdom” (ibid.). Historian Jay Spaulding (1990:288) rightly discusses under
which circumstances Nobiin, the language of subjugated Nobatia, was able to
gain its status as official language of the united kingdom. Sudanese archaeologist
Ali Osman (cited in Spaulding, ibid.) gives the answer to these questions when
he remarks “that no satisfactory answer [...] will be forthcoming as long as
scholars continue to conceptualize medieval Nubia strictly in terms of the modern geographical limits of Nile Nubian speech”. The discussion above revealed
that the widely held belief that two independent kingdoms, each with a different
Nubian language, existed in Nubia is completely unfounded. No reference to the
alleged unification is found in the written pre-Arab sources; the assumption of
such an event was necessary to explain the political unity of Nubia documented
in the Arab source.
With these interpretations and assumptions, the (re)construction of Nubian
history in the early medieval period had found its canonical form.","[224, 225]"
"Without going into detail it can be said that, although the situation seems to have
actually changed in the Nubian kingdom by the end of the 13th and beginning of
the 14th century, Arabic writing at that time most of all presents a legitimizingdiscourse on the entitlement of Arabs to finally claim the Nubian throne not as
usurpers, but as legal heirs (see Vantini 1975; Adams 1975:12).
For the sake of completeness, it has to be mentioned that non-Nubian Chris-tian sources do not end with the conversion stories of John of Ephesus and others. At a time when the Arab sources were silent, Abu Salih the Armenian who
was a Christian propagandist writing shortly before 1200 depicted Nubia as a
beautiful kingdom with wealthy churches. He seems to have had access to Arabic
sources because again much of his writing reads like a compilation from differ-ent sources.
Finally, we turn to the sources from Nubia itself. As has been mentioned before, the Arabic and also the Coptic texts from Nubia are for the most part not yet
published. Thus, our picture has to remain sketchy and the question as to thedifferent Nubian discourses cannot be answered yet. As most of what can be
classified as royal, economic, legal, and “emotional” discourses will be discussedbelow, it shall be pointed out here that most of the Old Nobiin texts preserved are
of a religious and theological nature, including translations from the New Testament, liturgical texts and homilies. As religious texts were also composed in
Greek and Coptic this suggests a powerful Christian discourse dominating or
better constructing Nobiin identity for several centuries.",[222]
"TRA-instead of TIAA-“god”CKT-instead
of ICKIT-— ‘earth’29pertFinally, Old Nobiin also had its system of punctuation which also followed
Greek practice. A raised point was regularly used to mark the end of a sentence,clause and colon. Other marks are sometimes employed to mark a question, the
end of a section of text or a verse. In addition, most of the scribes left spaces be-tween words. For details of punctuation and supraliteration Browne (1981:55-61)
should be consulted.","[29, 30]"
"If the Arab sources can be trusted most of the conflicts between Nubia and
Egypt which evolved in the course of the next centuries originated from the failure or unwillingness to fulfill the obligations of the treaty on the part of the Nu-bians. As we have only one side of the story one dare say that this reflects a Muslim discourse which tries to question the ability of an undefeated non-Muslim
neighbor to maintain a peaceful relationship and to legitimize any future attempt
at finally conquering people who were constructed as inferior.",[222]
"The origins of the second paradigm in Modern Nobiin are difficult to determine.
One explanation would relate the different endings to the Old Nobiin interrogative -ha which assimilated to the endings of the present or past. But this would
be contradicted by the meager evidence where in one of the two instances -ha issuffixed to the question word and not to the verb. On the other hand, the use of
-ha after the verb could have been generalized while at the same time its use102——what-you-CONT-sick-CAUS-2SGINTERROGPRES-[DS]after the interrogative pronoun could have been lost. At the moment, this explanation looks like the most plausible, although it cannot be proven.","[102, 103]"
"21612. General Conclusions on Language Change inNobiinAlthough Modern Nobiin has much in common with its predecessor Old Nobiin
the language changed in significant ways in the course of about a millennium.
This does not come as a surprise, as language change is a permanent process not
least dependent on the social and political changes its speakers undergo in the
course of time. At all times, Nubia was a region where a multitude of languageswere spoken and written, a multi-lingual contact zone where different factors
influenced language use, language change, and also language shift.
The creation of a written form of Old Nobiin, which was used in different
contexts such as church, political administration, economic transactions and the
personal sphere, is evidence of an highly organized political structure. It alsoseems to have been one important means of constructing a Nobiin identity because at that time, the Nobiin already had two written languages, Greek and
Coptic, at their disposal. As on the one hand the oldest manuscript preserved
dates back to the end of the 8h century and written sources on the other hand
indicate that the Nobiin had been the dominant political force in Nubia from atleast the 6th century onwards, one has to ask for the reason why the Nobiin wanted a written form of their mother tongue at exactly that time. Written sources
from neither inside nor outside Nubia give an answer to that question. We can
only speculate that the period under consideration was a relatively peaceful one
which allowed for such a process. At the same time, the advancing Arab/Moslem
neighbors north of Nubia might have created an urgent necessity to construct and
assure a Nobiin identity. Political and religious changes finally led to the disappearance of written Nobiin at the end of the 15th century. A Nobiin identity seems
to have no longer been sought after.
The multi-lingual setting of medieval Nubia was the main factor in triggering
language change as it was described in this study. Between the 6th and the 13th century Old Nobiin, as the language of the royal house, the administration, and also ofreligion, was of high prestige which was certainly important to acquire knowledge of for all those who spoke other languages as their mother tongue. First and
foremost, the speakers of Nubian Dongolese/Kenzi have to be mentioned here217which were settling in the Nubian Nile Valley as neighbors of and amongst the
Nobiin from the 4"") century onwards.","[216, 217, 218]"
"As the conditional is discussed in detail in chapter 7, one example has to suffice
here. We also find the new future/intentional where the English version of thebible has constructions with modal verbs, as in

purposes. Also at the same time, this example consists of questions about the
future. A similar modal use is documented in the next example where fa- func-tions as additional marker of a jussive:

that they are speculative and irrealis.",[161]
"The different functions of the so-called emphatic particles in Old Nobiin outlined
above might explain why so many sentences and clauses with -sin and even more
so with -/o are found in the texts and in the examples given in this study. In spiteof these numerous examples from Old Nobiin, the two emphatic particles obviously have disappeared in Modern Nobiin. The evidence is insufficient to finally
decide on the matter but Khalil (1996) is the only one who cites in his dictionary
of Modern Nobiin a suffix -sen with the presumed meaning of ‘yes, certainly,
sure’ which presumably corresponds to ‘Old Nobiin’ -sin as the translation suggests an emphatic connotation.",[104]
"13.7 Administration and Clergy
The Qasr Ibrim texts contain an immense number of official titles from the political as well as the church administration. Adams (1996:246) poses the question
whether more than one hierarchy may be represented. There is, however, no
evidence to support this consideration. What the sheer number of titles shows isthat the medieval kingdom constructed itself as a highly organized and hierarchical entity matching the Byzantine Empire. Whether all of the titles refer to actual21 This is mentioned e. g. by Al-Hakam, (Vantini 1975:57), Al-Baladhuri speaks of “archers of the
eyes” (ibid., 80)234functions within the bureaucracy or some are only honorary ones, cannot be
decided.
Many titles are from Old Nobiin, others are adopted from the Byzantine imperial hierarchy. Adams (1996:246) has correctly pointed out that Byzantine titles
in Nubia do not necessarily implicate identical functions of the office holders.
Some of the Old Nobiin titles can be translated or at the least understood; most
elude translation and remain enigmatic. Some titles are always connected to
places whereas others are subordinated to superior offices like the eparch.","[234, 235]"
"2.3 Linguistic Variation within the Texts
Although Old Nobiin is undoubtedly an earlier variant of Modern Nobiin, it was
not in the strictest sense a standardized language. A close look at the text revealssome variations which shed light on the linguistic background of the scribes.
These variations are to be expected as the region was linguistically heterogeneous and it would oversimplify the situation to assume that all scribes were mother tongue speakers of Old Nobiin. In addition to that it goes without saying that20See Chapter 2.6.
See for example Keller 1992.int as ET,8

linguistic variation. It concerns the sale of land owned by a woman named Kapopi to another woman named Neuesi. With regard to content, it is fascinatingbecause it gives information about the position of women in Nubia at the end of
the 12th century (see chapter 13.8). Linguistically, it is interesting because it
contains numerous place names (see chapter 13.10) and most notably words not
found elsewhere. One of these is ana-biti (36 ii 3), presumably a beverage. It is
found as ana-piti in IT 34 1 29, and the second element -piti presumably corre-sponds to -pitti in ChN. 5.11 and St. 22.5 where it is also found in a compound
denoting a beverage. The phoneme 6 of ana-biti is not part of the original inventory of Nobiin and is also not found as allophonic variant of p. The modern correspondence of Old Nobiin p is f so that it is not evidence of regular sound
change. -biti actually represents the expected Dongolese/Kenzi form because Old
Nobiin p, Nobiin f regularly correspond to Dongolese/Kenzi 5 and vice versa.
Although a scribal error cannot be excluded, the writing variant can also indicatea different linguistic background. The latter assumption is supported by another
lexeme found in IT III 36, kal- ‘to eat’. The verb ‘to eat’ is one of the few lexemes diagnostic for classifying a wordlist as Nobiin or Dongolese/Kenzi by
origin. kal- is the Dongolese/Kenzi word shared by most of the other Nubian
languages whereas Old and Modern Nobiin have the isolated word kap-/kab-.
IT III 36 is the only instance where kal- is documented in writing but in the same
text, also kap- is found.","[20, 21]"
"It can be concluded that an opposition between morphologically marked directionality—“motion towards” and “motion away”—existed in Old Nobiin. The
150markers were independent verbs which semantically contained the direction they
indicated. Both constructions, however, were rarely used. Only very few instances of the verbal complex with -ed could be found, some more of the one
with -(oJos. -(o)Jos and -ed follow the adjunctive in this complex which can,
however, be omitted. There is at least one instance where -ed follows the indica-tive (jan-ona is-sana) which looks like a periphrastic indicative.
The question arises what happened to these constructions in Modern Nobiin.
In contrast to Old Nobiin, verbal complexes with the suffix -(o)os as a second or
last element are abundant in the modern language. In Abel’s Ermenne narrative,
more than one hundred complexes with -(oJos can be counted within the two
hundred sentences. In spite of the extensive occurrence of -(o)os complexes all
authors found it rather difficult to understand and analyze its function and meaning. More than one hundred years ago, Richard Lepsius (1880:156) wrote about
the use of -(ojos:
Eine sehr gewdhnliche Erweiterung der Verbalstimme ist die in -ose. Sie kann sich fast
mit jedem Verbum verbinden, [...], ohne daB sich eine bestimmte Verinderung der Bedeutung nachweisen lieBe. Es scheint, daB sie nur den Nachdruck vermehrt, mit welchem einWort oder eine Form gebraucht werden soll, oder da8 nur der Tonfall den Sprechenden
veranlaBt, das Verbum mit oder ohne diese schwere Endung zu gebrauchen, so willkirlichbedient man sich derselben anscheinend und nicht selten in einem und demselben Satz.","[150, 151]"
"In the Miracle of St. Menas, the woman referred to above is barren. The sentencedescribes a continuing situation which later is changed only by a miracle. It is
beyond all question that -ag is not used in its literal meaning, but what literallyrenders ‘sit being barren’ is some sort of durative with -ag as its marker. The next
example also comes from a religious text:(Chrys. 23,16-18)

and banishing them from paradise. God curses Adam (‘on your chest [...] you
will crawl [...]’) and the curse is explained by the evil desired by the heart withinthat chest. Undoubtedly, we once again find the Old Nobiin -ak- complex denoting an ongoing situation.
Unfortunately, Old Nobiin doesn’t offer many instances of such a complex.
Although it is documented in the more formal religious or theological texts it is
hardly ever used. It can, however, be observed, that -ak-/-a(a)g- was occasionallyused as second verb in a complex where it expressed duration. We have to turn to
Modern Nobiin to track its development.
In Modern Nobiin, the verb is found as -aag which is still used as a suffix in
verbal complexes.","[168, 169]"
"1984/85,1989,15ment of writing starting with the Egyptian occupation. Writing not only became a
cultural pattern but also some functional aspects of its use can be observed con-tinuously throughout several millennia. Thus, writing in Nubia was an expression
of religious beliefs and a new religion often brought a new writing system.
There are at least two interesting questions to be asked concerning literacy inancient Nubia. The first relates to the degree to which members of the Nubian
population could and did read and write. The second refers to the degree to
which the Nubians made use of writing and the purposes to which they put their
competence. Little can be said about the time of the Egyptian occupation other
than that literacy was restricted to a small group of scribes of northern origin.
Between 1000 and 750 BC, relationship between Nubia and Egypt deteriorated
and a new center of power emerged around the 4"" Nile Cataract. The new ruling
elite was literate from the outset and initially utilized the Egyptian language forofficial and religious purposes. The situation changed dramatically in the 3 century BC when the native Meroitic language gained official status and was put in-to writing. The new alphabet which was developed consisted of about 24 characters and was based on Egyptian demotic signs. At the same time, Egyptian
hieroglyphic forms were borrowed for another form of writing which was very
rarely used. Millet (1974:50) has pointed out that the high proportion of errors in
Meroitic hieroglyphic texts shows “that even literate persons were not normally
very familiar with it”. The choice of a second script might have been a matter of
positioning oneself in the tradition of the Egyptian empire and to retain the imperial cartouche. The demotic or cursive Meroitic script, however, was clearly intended for an every-day use “with pen and ink” (Millet, ibid.). Besides, for example, funeral stelae, inscribed offering-tablets, and a few historical inscriptions
which are more official and often standardized, a great number of graffiti on
temple walls and rock surfaces along major roads as well as ostraca documenting
business or financial transactions have been found in even the smallest Meroitic
villages. In addition, there are enough fragments of documents on papyrus and
parchment to suggest a culture which appreciated books. With the decline of Meroitic political power in the 4 century AD, written Meroitic disappeared. When
Old Nubian became a written language, some of the characters seem to havedirectly been developed from Meroitic ones,’ so that at least a rudimental form of
Meroitic writing must have survived for quite some time.","[15, 16]"
"243administration acted differently. What has been said about the personal touch of
the eparchal correspondence also applies to the priestly letters. The priest Iesou,
for example, seems to express his unfortunate circumstances when he writes
(IT III 55): “In everything I am exposed. I call the king to my land. He is reluctant. The one whom I sent will intervene: he loves me.” Different kinds of complaints about personal misfortune seem to constitute part of the generally accepted public discourse in medieval Nubia.
Unfortunately, the presumably most personal letters are mostly fragmentary
and might not all have been deliberately preserved. Interpersonal relationships,
emotional distress and support are dealt with in these documents. In a letter to a
woman addressed ‘daughter of Eitene’ (IT II 28), the female author seems rather
emotional and worried when she writes: “Except for you, I have had no one. You
I have held like mother and like sister and I praise (you) through (our) relationship.
You do not know what the son of Doue is like. May he not come and rain you.” In
another letter, translated by Browne with some question marks (IT {! 26), a man
named Basilios evidently tries to lend support to his distressed friend {srael,

and don’t lose (?) heart when I go. Sit together for I shall not sleep.”
Summarizing it can be said that the letters of Qasr Ibrim represent an extraordinary type of sources which allows us to get a picture of everyday communication and interpersonal relationships in medieval Nubia.","[243, 244]"
"13.12 Letter-writing
The documents most difficult to understand and interpret are the letters from
Qasr Ibrim. This is partly due to their fragmentary condition, partly due to the
informal character of the language used which often seems to reflect spoken
language. This is exciting for a linguist who gets a glimpse of a linguistic variation which otherwise mostly remains unknown but frustrating for anyone concentrating on content. Because only one side of the correspondence is preserved,
understanding is additionally impeded. More often than not the question arises
what the writer wanted to communicate to the addressee.
The letters fall into different categories, depending on their being more or less
official in character. The most difficult to understand is the personal correspondence. Rather official are the letter to and from the eparchs which often refer to
disbursement of grain. Grain seems to have been stored either in central storage
facilities or in places belonging to the eparch.”¢ In spite of the official character
of these letters, they also show a personal touch which breathes life into the medieval texts. Even though problems with economical transactions are addressed,
personal remarks reveal actual human beings speaking to us. “Come, in order
that I may show you affection. What is it? The king has ordered you. Why are
you reluctant to approach the task?”, an unidentified eparch writes to a mancalled Maffuda. Another letter seems to have been dictated or written by a possibly angry Eparch Adam (IT III 51). It reads unintentionally comical when Adam
writes: “Being reluctant to give (them) to her (agent) who was about to come, I
took the dates and gulped them down.”
Amongst the letters preserved we also find documents originating from the
ecclesiastical administration as well as priestly correspondence. Concerning the
latter, Adams (1996:229) wonders about the reason why they were actually archived because “they do not appear to deal with matters of great consequence”.
This, however, we are not in the position to decide in retrospective. And if we
look at modern administrative practices of preserving every snippet of paper atleast for a certain period of time there is no reason to assume that the medieval

perfect constructions in Old Nobiin when they were followed by the suffixes of
the present. Although there are only two examples with the preterit, a perfective
meaning is already indicated in these instances. In Modern Nobiin, verbal com-plexes with kon-/kun-/ko- are restricted to the preterit. This restriction comes
along with a loss of the function of a perfect. The kon-/kun-/ko- complex functions as a perfective in most of the examples above. That Werner failed to distinguish the formation from the preterit indicates a loss in functional differentiationthe endpoint of which was reached in the negative past where the complex with
kon-/kun-/ko- completely replaced the old preterit.","[174, 175, 176]"

Whether a literal meaning is intended, as Browne (1991:53) indicatesin his translation, has to be questioned. The context suggests that Maffuda is not
actually sitting in assembly with someone at the time of the sale of land which
the document certifies but that a continuing situation of Maffuda belonging to a
circle of elders is implied.
There are at least two other instances of -ak as second verb in a complex:

"Evidence for the verbal extension with /a(a)- as a late development in Nobiin
is the less close relationship between the element and the main verb. The next
examples show that different objects can be placed between the two:

form as future but assumes that historically, there was a difference between the
old and the new future in that the old construction with suffixes marked a general
future and the new construction with prefix /a(a)- an intention and will to do
something. To his knowledge, this distinction had disappeared at the time of his
research and constructions with fa(a)- were in the process of completely substituting the old future. As mentioned above, Werner (1987:151) speaks of ingressive with a second and—if at all—third function as intentional and future. Heinterprets fa(a)- as expressing a strong certainty that an action or event is going159to take place. Thus, in the sentence aboo fa shongir-k ide-e ‘My father will send
money’, the speaker is quite certain that money will be send. Abel’s informants
(1913:13) give rather similar explanations when they translate fa-ju-r ‘I will go
(certainly, I will definitely go)’. According to Abel, fa(a)- functions as futuretense marker if an exact temporal specification is given, e. g.
Sahr-ee-n-ahara
month-one-GEN-afterirkuna
homefa-ju-r
IFUT-go-ISGPRES‘After one month I will go home (I definitely intend to go)’This example, however, is an isolated sentence and has no context. In Abel’s
Ermenne narration, the fa(a)- prefix is predominantly used in conditional clauses. But there are also some other contexts, e. g.:

silk-of‘I will buy two nice silk dresses for Shatirhassan.’The speaker expresses an intention or wish to buy two dresses; she receives
money from her husband, goes to the market and actually buys the dresses.","[159, 160]"
"23213.6 Being Nubian/Nobiin
The interpretation of historical sources has most notably been influenced by the
designations “‘Nubia” and “Nubian” as they were constructed by European schol-ars in the late 19th and early 20 centuries. The implications of these constructions and their different uses have been discussed elsewhere (Bechhaus-Gerst
1996: 156-163) and will not be repeated here. The question to be discussed in
this chapter is whether or how a Nubian identity is constructed in the Old Nobiin
and non-Nubian texts.
Starting with the direct evidence of the Old Nobiin texts, it has to be noted
that the term “Nubian” or “Nobiin”—we don’t really know how it was under-stood in the medieval period—in the form nop- is documented in only one of the
Qasr Ibrim texts referring to a person. The single other instance speaks of a
camel called “Nubian”. Fortunately, the one instance of nop- designating a person provides an insight into the construction of a Nubian identity. The text (IT III
33) concerns the release of a slave named Apa by his former owner Kapopi of
Ibrim. Apa, as it is related by the text, does not plan to leave upon his manumission but is going to stay with Kapopi—presumably as a kind of wage worker.
The decisive passage says that Apa is going to be kept by Kapopi as a Nubian/Nobiin. No further explanation is given, as the Nobiin certainly knew about
the implications of this declaration. Implicitly, however, this passage tells us that
a Nobiin/Nubian was a free person, i. e. a man or woman not enslaved. It is furthermore evident of a Nubian/Nobiin identity which was not restricted to birthright and accordingly not constructed as fixed affiliation. A legal or declarative
process might have been necessary to become a Nubian/Nobiin, but nothing
definitive can be deduced from the scant evidence. In Nobiin, the term ofkir
‘slave language’ is documented as a designation for a language besides Nobiin
spoken in the kingdom which shows the construction of an unfree “other” within
the society dominated by speakers of Old Nobiin. Interestingly, this differentia-tion is supported by Arab author al-Mas’udi who wrote in the first half of the
10"" century: “The Nuuba who are subjects of this king are divided into two
classes: a class whom we have described as free from all servitude, and a class of
subjects who are slaves” (Vantini 1975:135).
The designation “Nubian/Nobiin” is not documented in any other Old Nobiin
text and further interpretation has to be deductive or discuss the perception or
construction of Nubian/Nobiin identity by non-Nubians.
Although the “grand narrative” of the rise and triumph of Christianity in Nubia is told in non-Nubian sources (see above) the documentary texts of Qasr
Ibrim present the Old Nobiin society as having been deeply anchored in the233Christian belief. A standard introductory formula of contracts and letters invokes
the Lord or the Holy Trinity. The terms of the various contracts are underscoredby curses in the name of the aforementioned and the estrangement from God is
used as a menace against anyone trying to counteract a contract.
Qasr Ibrim, of course, was a centre of religious activity in Medieval Nubia
and the documents mention as many as ten churches for Ibrim/Ibrim West and
additional ten for the vicinity of Ibrim (Adams 1996:252). Pilgrim’s graffiti alsoattest to the importance of religiousness in the life of the Nubians visiting the
churches of Ibrim. Additional indirect evidence for the construction of Christianidentities is found in traditional Christian personal names found in the texts.
Theseare, however,muchless commonthan Nobiinnamesor combinationsofelements from the two backgrounds. The naming of children obviously did not
necessarily function as demonstration of Christian belief.","[232, 233, 234]"
"There is one which seems to correspond to Lepsius’ example:
(Erm. 76)
ta-ineyeirinkenesimark-a-fi-e-[y]ai-logomola-ijeREL-DEM?[she said]yoursobe angry-ADJ-STAT-INFPRES{she said]I-toclose-[she said]‘this which [she said] makes you angry-[she said], is easy for me’The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘that which is your being angry about, is
close to me’. Whether -in actually represents the demonstrative or is a remnant of
-in ‘to be’ is difficult to decide.
Lepsius (1880:391) documents another context in which faa is used:
(GM 2,10)
taa
uk-koo
FINn_irber-okomyou-PL-andknow-2PLPRES‘and so that you may know’Here, faa seems to introduce a final clause. All things considered there isn’t
enough evidence to draw definite conclusions concerning the origin of faa. As is,
however, documented for other languages too, the element might be related to
the 3-4 person singular pronoun far (see e.g. Heine & Reh 1984:280). Theredoesn’t seem to be any evidence for this type of construction in Old Nobiin. This
might explain why only very few instances can be found in the known texts. An
equivalent can presumably be found in those relative clauses introduced by demonstrative pronoun in.
Lepsius (ibid.) describes another construction as equivalent of a relative
clause. This is introduced by an interrogative pronoun and interpreted by him as
an indirect question. His examples are from the translation of the gospel:214(GM 14.44)

°The overview is far from being exhaustive. A systematic study of Nobiin syntax
will presumably uncover additional types and enable more systematic categorization. It can, however, be concluded that the type most frequently used employs
the participle in the relative clause. These types more or less correspond to theconstruction in Old Nobiin presented above. Juxtaposition of two indicatives is
also documented rather frequently and presumably corresponds to a constructionwith subjunctive in the relative clause in Old Nobiin. The types with introducing
pronouns are rarely used and are not present in Old Nobiin.","[214, 215]"
"2.2 Old Nobiin
Old Nobiin was decipheredin 1906 by Heinrich Schafer and Karl Schmidt, andits scientific study started in 1913 when F. LI. Griffith published the then known
texts in his Nubian texts of the Christian period. From early on, it was evident
that the language was a predecessor of modern Nobiin and not of one of the other
Nubian languages of the Nile Valley, Kordofan or Darfur. There are, however,
some differences between Old and Modern Nobiin which cannot be explained by
language change but have presumably to be traced back to dialectal variation.
What we know as Old Nobiin might reflect one or more dialects or variants of
the language which have completely disappeared. As dialectal studies of modern
Nobiin have not yet been undertaken and the few grammatical and lexical studies
represent only part of the picture, the closest relative of Old Nobiin on the dialectal level might simply have not yet been found. Another explanation might be
found in a development similar to for example the process in Germany in the
medieval period. It has been pointed out that early written German was some sort
of “mixed language” in terms of a mixing of elements from geographically and
temporally different origins.’ Old Nobiin is a very uniform language; only in
vocalic alternations we may find some dialectal variation.
It is interesting to discuss why the Nubians wanted to put their language into
writing when they had already at their disposal Greek and Coptic and possibly
initially Meroitic too as written media of communication. They definitely wanted
to demonstrate their self-confidence as a kingdom which even outdared the Arab-Egyptian attempts at invasion. The rise of Nobiin as a written language seems
also to have corresponded to the formation of a highly structured and authoritarian political entity which covered different small kingdoms and other political
entities with people of different linguistic background. This “nation state” might
have been in need of a local language as a medium and symbol of demarcation
against the outside world. Written Nobiin possibly was an important component
of the construction of a Nubian empire in the succession of Meroe, as it, for
example, definitely stated its end.

however, were modelled on the Coptic alphabet and three letters were presuma-Stee POEwriting presumably sometime during the 8th century when political stabilizationnecreation of a written and somehow standardized language. Nobiin was put intobly taken from Meroitic.®With the creation of its written form, Old Nobiin gained a sort of official status as the language of religious texts, of commercial activities as well as of the
correspondence between government officials. One can safely assume that Old
Nobiin was a language of high prestige which was important to learn for those
who didn’t speak it as their mother tongue. Most of the texts preserved come
from the 10th to the 12th centuries. This could be merely a question of not having
discovered more documents from different periods. A more plausible explanation
is a natural increase in the production of literary as well as documentary text in
the course of the period under consideration. This process would parallel a similar
one in Europe where literary production considerably increased in the 11 and
12‘ centuries.? In Europe, however, this development had its peak in the
13h century, when in Nubia the situation started to deteriorate.","[19, 20]"
"To complete the picture additional postpositions have to be discussed. Into the
category of simple postpositions belong the two very similar ones
Old Nobiin
-(I-)logo, -(I-)loko
-doko‘through, by, in’
‘through, for the sake of, for’Browne (1996:49) raised the question whether the two must be regarded as mere
variants. -doko and -/oko appear in the same text in
(IT Il 28, 5-6 and 9-11)oros-imme-kon
praise-ADM1SG-andkonk-il-loko
_relationship-through‘and I praise you through (our) relationship’
id-doko
you-for (the sake of)domm-a__uskr-eso
take-ADJ
put away-IMPERSG‘for the sake of you, take (him) and put (him) away’If we take a look at the texts, we can observe that the two postpositions are not
mere variants. -doko is only used with persons and follows e. g. personal pronouns, names or office holders, as in soyojin wiskit-il-doko (IT II 21.1.25-26)
‘through the deputy of the Sonoj’, id-doko (IT III 46.2, 58.1) ‘through you’,ma{Juda-doko (IT III 47.1) ‘through Maffuda’. -/ogo/-loko is mainly documented
with abstracts, the name of the Lord, animals, things, anything inanimate, as in
teuder-roko (IT II 15 i 13) ‘in the error’, ten senti-loko (IT II 16 vii 8-9) ‘through
their prayer’, koir-roko ‘through the tree’ (ChN 19.17-18). We can conclude thatOld Nobiin had two very similar postpositions, one with initial -d-, the other with
initial -/- with similar meanings, one of which followed animate entities, the
other inanimate ones. Interestingly however, all examples for -doko are found in
the non-literary and non-religious texts of Qasr Ibrim II and III and the questionraises how this phenomenon must be interpreted.
Taking a look at Modern Nobiin we find that Werner (1987:129) proposes asimilar distribution for the present-day variants:
Modern Nobiin
-log(o)
-dog,46‘through, with’
‘with, at’instrumental/locational
with personsIn the Ermenne narrative, however, -dogo is not documented. Instead -/ogo is
used with persons in taf-faab-logo ‘to his father’ (AE 65), ay-gii-guu-logo ‘at his
uncles’ (AE 67), ai-logo ‘with me’ (AE 76). Lepsius (1880:42, 45) differentiates
between the two postpositions but admits that only one of his main informants
knew both, the other only used -/ogo. Hassan who came from the region between
Faras and Wadi Halfa knew -dogo as well as -logo, whereas Ali from Derr in the
north and Abel’s informant from Ermenne only knew the second one. We can
conclude that dialectal variation was and is involved here, but this doesn’t sufficiently explain why and how -doko suddenly appears in the Old Nobiin texts. At
least two possibilities can be offered here. The two postpositions -/oko and -doko
were present in one or more dialects of the old language which became more
prominent at the time the text of Qasr Ibrim II and III were written. Alternatively,
-doko can be regarded as an innovation in the spoken language which the language of the non-literary texts is closer to. The problem cannot exhaustively be
resolved on the basis of the available written evidence.
Other postpositions which are present in the old and modern variants analyzed
here are
Old Nobiin
-danModern Nobiin
‘with, occasionally against’-(I)dal_‘with, at”The change from Old Nobiin -/ to Modern Nobiin -n is found elsewhere.
Old Nobiin
-(I)donModern Nobiin
‘(down) from’-la-toon
-do-toon‘from, since”
‘from’The change from Old Nobiin -d- to Modern Nobiin -f- is a common one. -(/)don
in Old Nobiin represents a rather peculiar case, because it is usually found with
the expression ‘(heavenly) Jerusalem’. In IT III] 35.16 we have one adverbial use
in a different context
(IT HII 35.16)
sag-asindon-usk-il-locharge-COPdown-put-PARTPRES-EMPH‘the charge that I put down’According to Werner (1987:135ff.), -toon regularly follows another postposition,i.e. either -/a or -do, in Modern Nobiin. Only with a few local nouns like ‘the
north’ or ‘the south’, -toon is suffixed without an additional postposition. In his
list of words, Abel (1913:90ff.) only mentions -/(a)-toni. But in the narrative, wefind several examples for the compound siddo-toon ‘where from’ which consists
of the interrogative pronoun sid-do ‘where, where to, wherefrom’ and -toon.","[46, 47]"
"Participle Periphrastic
The participle is usually—though not always—in the present when used in periphrastic constructions. Tense/aspect is therefore marked at the following secondverb. The ending of the participle is often deleted. Examples are:
(IT1 4.15)
pes-kon in-sna

from the following -in ‘to be’ by the conjunction -kon ‘and’. The participle peri-phrastic looks like a mere stylistic variant

forms can presumably be regarded as one reason for their disappearance on the
way to Modern Nobiin. Kept, though changed, were those forms with no non-periphrastic alternatives. Interestingly, most of the second verbs used in periphrasticconstructionsarepreservedinModernNobiin:au-‘to do’,okkir-(causative of ok- ‘to be’) ‘to put’, dar- ‘to be’, kin- ‘be without, be poor’, midde‘be full’ are still documented in the dictionaries as independent verbs.
The development of the verb in- ‘to be’ which was frequently used in peri-phrastic constructions constitutes a special case. In affirmative use, it was replaced by a verb men- ‘to be’. It looks exactly like the negative verb of Old Nobiin and its origin has to be discussed. That this is a random similarity seems tobe highly improbable. The complete paradigm for the present is listed by Lepsius
(1880:79):
Isc
2sG
38Gmen or min
men-nam, min-nam
(men)IPL
2PL
3PLmen-nu
men-nokom, min-, munmen-nan, min-nanIn addition to that, the original -in reappears in the negative for which Lepsius
(ibid., 117) gives the paradigm with final -7 assimilated to the negative verb:
IsGim-munIPLim-munu2sGim-minam2PLim-munokom3sGim-mun3PLim-minnanmen- ‘to be’ always follows the predicative/adjunctive -a, a way of constructing
verbal complexes which was already present in Old Nobiin, but later completely
replaced the periphrastic constructions. If we take into consideration that one of
the functions of the participle and predicative periphrastic with -in and -men wasto topicalize the verb it is perfectly feasible that the topicalized negative verb
was reinterpreted as positive verb ‘to be’.
In the next chapters, the four constructions which found their way into Modern Nobiin will be presented.","[120, 121]"
"Browne (1982 and more) replaces emphatic with indicative but otherwise agreeswith Zyhlarz’ general interpretation of the verbal system. Both authors regard the
subjunctive as one of the forms of the verb in subordinate clauses, the other one
being the participle. Browne’s thorough analyses has shown that both forms are71verbal nouns distinguished by the overt expression of person and number in the
subjunctive whichis missing with the participle. Althoughin someinstancesirrealis features might be involved, they are by no means predominant or even
important. First and foremost, the subjunctive in Old Nobiin is a subordinator
used in all kinds of complement clauses without any notion of irrealis, the main
factor being the necessity to express person and number.
.
Correspondingly, the term indicative refers to the form of the verb in mainclauses if person and number have to be expressed. Otherwise, parallel to the
participle in complement clauses, the predicative is used in main clauses.
All authors writing on Modern Nobiin also dealt with the question of the exis-tence of a subjunctive in the language. Lepsius and Reinisch who had no knowledge of Old Nobiin came to different conclusions. Reinisch (1879:82) lists a
paradigm for the subjunctive in Modern Nobiin which mainly differs from the
indicative in the absence of the innovated second person singular and plural (see
below chapter 6.1). There are, however, no convincing examples in his texts.
Lepsius obviously wasn’t aware of a subjunctive in Nobiin and ignores it completely. In his comment on Reinisch’s grammar (1880:477) he points to the factthat no examples are given and that his informants are ignorant of the forms.
Eighty years later, Abel (1921:3) describes the old subjunctive of Nobiin as about
to disappear. Another sixty years later, Werner (1987:192) recorded the remains
of a subjunctive paradigm which only shows up when followed by the postposi-tion -faan ‘until’. It is no longer productive and the comparison with Abel’s
paradigm reveals that in the 2nd and 3% person singular, the personal endings
were either lost and replaced by the suffix of the Infinitive -e, as Werner (ibid.)
suggests, or simply reduced from -en to -e. Neither in the singular nor in the
plural, the innovated suffixes of the 2.4 person are found.

with Abel’s paradigm of the subjunctive is that it looks like the indicative minusthe innovated 2""4 persons. That there actually are remnants of the old subjunctive
in Modern Nobiin is most obvious in Wemer’s 1st person singular and 1st and
2d person plural where even the ambiguous forms of the Old Nobiin subjunctive
are preserved. If the attempt at reconstructing the innovated personal endings is72at least partly correct (see below) it is consistent that they are missing in the
subjunctive. The indicative copulative -m(a) never follows a verb in the subjunctive in Old Nobiin (see chapter 9.5). A much simpler explanation would arguewith the status of the subjunctive as disappearing as a productive paradigm at the
time of the innovation of the 2person ending which was only preservedinfixed paradigms like the so-called ‘subjunctive with -faan’.
To summarize these excursive remarks it can be emphasized that the terms indicative/subjunctive are maintained in this book basically referring to morphologically distinct verb forms in Old Nobiin found in main and subordinate/complement clauses. How these combine with various tense/aspect constructions willbe discussed in the respective chapters. In Modern Nobiin, the morphologically
marked distinction is lost, but looking at the endings (see below) it is far fromobvious whether these represent reduced endings of the old indicative or whether
the old subjunctive was generalized and also used instead of the original forms.
Definitely, predicative -a, which was characteristic of Old Nobiin indicative, ismissing in Modern Nobiin.","[71, 72, 73]"

Werner’s list shows that the negation was further simplified because -muunalso replaced theIst person plural ending still present atLepsius’ time. The origin of -muun remains enigmatic as there is no trace of this
variant in Old Nobiin. Although-i- and -u- often interchangein Old Nobiin,123there doesn’t seem to be one example of it in the case of the negative verb. It can
be speculated whether another negative verb, i. e. mon-/mun- ‘to hate, reject, be
reluctant’ (= m-on- ‘not to love’), forms the basis of this paradigm. There Is,
however, no evidence supporting this suggestion. In all probability, the influenceof the emphatic particle -/o which was regularly suffixed to the negative verb in
Old Nobiin is responsible for the change. A regressive vocalic assimilation might
have led to the change from -i-/-e- to -u-.
For the preterit, the endings of Old Nobiin were completely replaced by the
innovated complex with -kun- which is only rarely used in the positive form (seechapter 10.8). The paradigm of the negative preterit is:

because—amongst other things—they specify an indirect object in a verbal complex. Still, tir-/den- as second element are used in a verbal complex after the
adjunctive -a which is, however, often missing. The following paradigm showsthe modern endings which are contracted from -tir- plus present tense personal

In addition to iig- ‘to say’ Lepsius (1880:139) lists a few other verbs which
mostly take tir-/den-. These verbs are: wiidkire- ‘to answer’, gafre ‘to forgive’,arre ‘to bring’, nadiife ‘to clean’, faai- ‘to write, prescribe’, iidir- ‘to send’, aaw‘to do’, and fedd- ‘to beg’. His examples come from the gospel of St. Mark, such as:With Surface Direct Object

Nobiin as independent verbs with the meaning ‘to give someone (2""4/3""d person)’
and ‘to give to me/us (1st person)’. The verbs are found in verbal complexes
following the adjunctive -a which was occasionally missing at the older stageand is more often omitted in present-day Nobiin. It did function and still functions as an applicative. Underlying indirect or oblique object are marked by fir-/
den- regardless of whether they are realized as surface directs objects, surface
oblique objects or not realized on the surface at all. This construction can be
regarded as rather unchanged in the process of languages development from the
Medieval period to the present.","[144, 145, 146, 147]"

‘and the father said to the boy: “O in truth, cooking bring it to me, in order that I may eat”The example shows that the construction could be used, if the subject of the
purpose clause was not identical to the subject of the main clause. As for the
conditional, there is also a variant with -ka which is documented in one of the
Qasr Ibrim texts:

marked is also documented.in which the personis notFinally, in a third construction the imperative in connection with the verb il‘to say’ and complementizer -a can serve to express a purpose clause (see alsoExcurse 2 where additional examples are given), as in:

they-GENtauo
da-l-gu-ka

redcem-PL-IMPER-EMPH-COMP‘in order that he might redeem those who are under the law’Looking at Modern Nobiin, the question arises what happened to these different
formations of purposes clauses. Although the conditional construction based on-ka has been preserved the conditional-based paradigm for the purposive presented above seems to have completely disappeared. Corresponding to Old Nobiin is a formation with an element -eenii which still has the variants -oonii and
-aani. Contrary, however, to the construction in Old Nobiin, the suffix is attachedto the tense/aspect/person marker of the verb, as in the following examples from
the Ermenne narrative and the Gospel of St. Mark:
(Erm. 103)ai
|fa-kir-a
IFUT-come-ADJikka

you_firge-k-ka
wish-PARTPRES-OBJfa-aaw-a-tee-r-een
IFUT-d0-ADJ-BEN-1SGPRES-PURP‘I will come, in order that I do for you what you want’In this example, the suffixing of the purpose marker to the tense/aspect/person
suffix is one indicator for a construction which basically differs from the one inOld Nobiin. Main clause and purpose clause are related as a verbal complex with
the main verb marked as adjunctive and only the verb in the purpose clause tak-ing the tense/aspect/person suffix. The purpose clause includes a pronominal
object and an additional object clause consisting of the present participle with thesuffix -ka.
This construction can also be used if the subjects of main and purpose clause
differ, as in
(GM1,17)abaag annaa kaj-j-an

man-PL-GENSaiaada-kaj-j-ir-eenifisherman-CAUS-PL-1 SGPRES-PURP
‘follow me so that | will make you fishers of men’195Because of the different subjects, the two verbs cannot be constructed as verbalcomplex but have to take separate tense/aspect/number markers.
In the last example, we also find separate markers in the clauses presumably
due to the imperative in the main clause:
(GM 6,31)
tann-ana-ion
gO-IMPERPL-he saidfalee
desertwee-lakidekka_tiig-all-ooni
one-toalittle
sit-FUT-PURP“go”, he said, “to a desert in order to stay a little”In all three examples, the verb is marked as future/intentional, the old as well as
the innovated formation are used. In the last sentence from the gospel, the imper-sonal purpose clause has the future infinitive and is not marked for person.
Werner (1987:166ff.) seems to be confused with regard to the correct segmentation of the suffixes when he categorizes the purposive (“Begriindungs- oderFinalform”) as present tense paradigm. He presents the following ending:
IsG-leeni/-reeniIPL-looni/-rooni2sG
3sG-nameeni
-naani2PL
3PL-lokomeetii
-innanaaniThese actually are the present tense suffixes to which the endings discussed
above were added. As Werner has no examples in his sentences but only the
paradigm he collected, it can only be assumed that in a context, the innovated
future prefix would have been required.","[194, 195, 196]"
"88According to Werner (1987:145), the imperative singular of Modern Nobiin is
identical to the verbal base (e. g. unni ‘give birth!’) and the plural shows a suffix-an following the ending -i of the verbal base which is, however, often omitted.
Unfortunately, no further information on the origin of the endings and the use
and function of the imperative are given. Werner also makes no mentioning of
jussive forms. One hundred years earlier, Lepsius (1880:139) listed a more complex paradigm (with tokk- ‘to shake’) for the imperative/jussive.

The negative imperative or jussive of Modern Nobiin evidently corresponds toOld Nobiin “vetitive” forms. Lepsius (1880:141) points out that these endings
follow -a which is the marker of direct speech (see below), thus adding another
correspondence to the Old Nobiin forms:

mention the use of the endings in the 3 person singular and plural. Examples ofthe use as negative imperative or jussive are found in the gospel of St. Mark and
in the Ermenne text. Below, some examples are given:

last two negative examples, however, show that the ending was replaced by avariety of suffixes. These necessitate a longer excurse on the origin of these
elements and their various functions.","[88, 89, 90]"
"Browne (ibid.) hypothesizes that -a is a reduced form of ia- ‘saying’ which con-sists of the verb -i plus adjunctive -a.
-a does not only function as marker of direct speech, but also as complemen-tizer in Old Nobiin. That Browne’s hypothesis on the origin of -a is correct, is
shown below, where the non-reduced and the reduced forms are found as complementizers in similar contexts. In these examples they are used with the verb
ank- ‘to think’:

follow the imperative, resulting in a complex suffix -eaion. The connection with
the imperative as well as with the verb ik- (ek-) ‘to say’ is found in the followingexamples from the documentary Qasr Ibrim text:

clauses are expressed by the infinitive and the verb i- + adjunctive -a. The resulting compound suffix -ia is often reduced to -a which functions as marker of
direct speech.
Wanting to summarize what has been discussed above we have to turn to thedifferent forms as well as to the various functions and the possible relationship of
the two.
In Old Nobiin, a verb il- ‘to say’ is found which is often reduced to i-. It hasvarious forms and functions depending on the contexts and the following endings. The forms and function can be listed as follows:
96FormFunctioni(l)i- + -a adjunctive reduced to -a-reinforces another verb of speaking
marker of direct speechi- + -a adjunctive or reduced -a
imperative + -ia or reduced -acomplementizer
purpose clauseThe combination of the various additional endings needed to express the different functions produces a wide range of compound suffixes, as e. g.
reduced -a-ai- + -a adjunctive
-ia + -ion conjunction ‘and’-ia
-iaionimperative -e + reduced -aimperative -e + emphatic -s(o) + reduced -a“a-esoa, -esaimperative -e + reduced -a + -ion conjunction-eaionimperative -ana + emphatic -s(o) + reduced -a-anasoSome of these endings are obviously related to those listed by Lepsius (1880) for
Modern Nobiin under the different headings “imperative”, “conjunctions” and
“purpose clause”. On the way from Old to Modern Nobiin the imperative/jussivedropped optional emphatic -so. Imperative markers -e and -ana are still present
from Old Nobiin. To these Lepsius (1880:139ff.) adds other endings which are
now well known from Old Nobiin. If we isolate these endings, we find:
SG-ee the long vowel presumably going back to imperative -e + -a
-ia(a)PL“a
-ia(a)According to Lepsius (1880:139ff.) for the 3"" person jussive occasionally -ion
for the singular and plural is added to the 24 person endings, resulting in suffixes
38G
3PL-eion
-anaionWhat we find here are not new endings for the imperative but the markers of
direct speech/complementizer of Old Nobiin. Either Lepsius misinterpreted these
endings due to the fact that all his examples for imperatives necessarily consistedof either direct speech or complement clauses/indirect speech or we are dealing
with a reanalysis of Old Nobiin purpose clause as simple imperatives.
Lepsius and Abel note that in the texts the different forms of the ending inter-change arbitrarily. These variations consist of:
Form
Lepsius
Abel-ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion
-eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiyeWemer= -aya/-yon/-ayon/-eyon97The endings given by Lepsius and Werner are similar, because they both includeat least some forms which add -ion/-yon. Werner (1987:342) lists -aya as nonpersonal form meaning ‘saying’. The three other suffixes are translated as ‘he
said’, thus being interpreted by him as 3'4 person singular preterit which, how-ever, has lost final -n according to his own paradigm. From the many examples
in the texts it seems much more probable that these endings go back to Old Nobiin forms with conjunction -ion ‘and’ (see above).","[95, 96, 97, 98]"
"9.5 Copulative Constructions
For the sake of completeness, two additional periphrastic constructions have to
be mentioned here. The following copulative constructions were much less
common in Old Nobiin. Browne’s (1989:29) ‘predicative copulative’ is restricted
to the 2™4 persons singular and plural. It complements the affirmative (see chapter 6.5) which provides the Ist and 34 persons. The suffixes -/e (SG) and -ke (PL)are attached to the predicative, in the plural -/- precedes in the present and future/intentional, -as- in the present and preterit. The forms documented in the
texts are:
PresentSG--PL_-ra-l-ke, -(r-)as-kePreterit ISG-ara-lePL-ar-as-keFuture/IntentionalsG-dra-lePL-arra-l-ke134Modern Nobiin has a full paradigm for the so-called affirmative which provides
enough reason for the disappearance of the form.
Browne (ibid.) identified another periphrastic construction which he called
“indicative copulative”. Postposition -m/(a), otherwise known as following nouns
in the predicative, is suffixed to an indicative. The examples suggest that in these
cases it topicalizes the verb, as in:
(NC 20.5-6)
kim-mis-so-m
ni-mis-so-ma
Cat-NEG-IPLPRETIIIND-COP drink-NEG-1 PLPRETIIIND-COP
‘is it we did not eat, it is we did not drink’That these constructions were uncommon in Old Nobiin might be one reason

Abel, the past is used. What Abel describes is the difference between a real condition and an irrealis. The father’s statement presents a real condition, because a
certainty is expressed, the event is taking place. By contrast, the son’s prediction
consists of an irrealis. As the development of the story shows, the situation of the
son deteriorates, because his stepmother tries to kill him. In the light of this development, some of the promises made by his father’s new wife are unreal in thatthey are blatant lies. They are therefore marked as irrealis, as in
(Erm 16)

IFUT-serve-ISGPRETik-koni
you-and_fa-fefag-is
IFUT-love-1SGPRET‘if your father marries me, I will serve you better than this and | will love you’The examples show that in Modern Nobiin real and unreal conditions can be
expressed and morphologically distinguished. Real conditions are characterized
by the endings of the conditional in the protasis and the endings of imperative or
innovated future which takes the suffixes of the present in the apodosis. In theirrealis, the endings of the conditional follow the perfect marker in the protasis,
and in the apodosis, the innovated future is followed by the suffixes of the pret-erit resulting in a future preterit. The first construction resembles those of real
conditions in Old Nobiin presented above. Whether the irrealis was expressed
accordingly in the old stage of the language has so far been left open. It seems
that there are only three instances of an irrealis documented in the texts. One of
these examples comes from Qasr Ibrim:
(IT 17 ii 15-16)
i-san-en-appa
know-3PLPRETIISUB-?-fornodu
Lordnok-in-ka
istauros-ildo _ ollir-imen-di-sana-sin
glory-GEN-OBJ cross-upon —_ hang-NEG-FUT-3PLPRETII-EMPH“for if they had known, they would not have hanged upon the cross the Lord of Glory’The apodosis has the endings of the old future followed by the suffixes of the
preterit II indicative, comparable to the construction in Modern Nobiin presented
above. The protasis differs in that the verb is preterit I] subjunctive which is in
accordance with its status as subordinate clause marked by -appa ‘for’. Thismight be due to the fact that contrary to the examples of Modern Nobiin where
the events and actions described are in the future at the time of speaking and still
an—if unlikely—possibility, the event described in the Old Nobiin example is no
longer possible because at the time of speaking, a different course of action has
109already been taken. In Old Nobiin, an additional element -en is inserted which
seems to be documented in only one other non-restorated instance:
(IT 1412-3)
inno duar[a?)en-kan an
irihereyoube-PRED-?-3SGCONDennaldi-me-dra-lomy brotherdie-NEG-FUT-PRED-EMPH‘if you had been here, my brother would not have died (lit.: ‘will not die’)This example has the 3% person conditional -kan in the position of -appa in theexample before. Although the past is not morphologically marked, the sentence
is an irrealis in the same way as has been found before. The events described
refer to a possibility which existed in the past.","[108, 109, 110]"
"Lepsius’ examples reveal that the negative forms originally follow the adjunctive
-a (see chapter 10) which is dropped with verbs ending in a vowel or single consonant.
Lepsius as well as Abel list some forms which they regard as remains of an old
preterit negative. In the Ermenne narrative, there is one example Abel discusses:
(Erm. 129)

-muun and denies a possible relationship with the verb moon- ‘to not want to, to reject’. There are various reasons why Abel’s interpretation seems highly improbable. Firstly, -moon- would be another variant of -miin/-muun- which is only docu-mented once. Secondly, Abel doesn’t explain why the regular negative preterit is
found in the first part of the sentence, but not in the second one. Thirdly, he doesn’texplain why wirk- is followed by -o- in the second instance, by adjunctive -a in
the first one. Correctly understood, -moon- actually is the aforementioned independent verb, together with wirk-, they form a verbal complex with both verbs marked as 3d person singular preterit. The whole sentence should be analysed as:124(Erm. 129)ila

him and his informant has to be assumed. None of the other forms in the paradigm are documented in his narrative.
In a similar way, Lepsius (1880:120) was convinced to have found a few rem-nants of a former negative preterit. His only example comes from the translations
of the gospel and is wrongly interpreted as pluperfect:

It was the habitual way, it says that every time a fox died
he jiggled with his ear. “Habitual situations are customarily repeated on different133occasions”, as Bybee et al. (1994:127) described it. The other sentences might be
called habitual insofar as situations are narrated which extend over a prolongedperiod of time in contrast to the accidental or momentary situation or action ofthe story. This, however, can also be described as a durative form. Most of all,
they set some sort of background for the sequences of action within the narra-tives which according to Hopper (1979, 1982) can be regarded as a general fea-ture of imperfective forms.
Comparing use and function of the -ke-/-ki-/-k-/-ken-complex in Old and
Modern Nobiin, some processes can be deduced. The use of -ke-/-ki-/-k- in peri-phrastic constructions is evidence for a verbal origin of the element. The verb
had already undergone a process of desemanticization in Old Nobiin. -ke-/-ki-/-kperiphrastics were not restricted as to tense but only used with the participle. Theoriginal main function may have been to mark a habitual; it seems, however, that
it was generalized to an imperfective at the level of Old Nobiin. It might be due
to the generalization process that the construction with -ke-/-ki-/-k- is fairly
widespread in Old Nobiin. On the way to Modern Nobiin, the broad spectrum ofperiphrastic constructions has disappeared. In the case of -ke-/-ki-/-kperiphrastics the relevant paradigmatic distinctions were lost. Instead one member of the paradigm, -ken-, replaced all the others. According to Browne
(1989:26), this an “expanded infinitive” which is, however, obscure in its origin.","[133, 134]"
"3.4 Formation of Nouns
Old Nobiin had a rich inventory of noun formation suffixes some of which will
be presented and discussed below. Of interest will be those still found in ModernNobiin either as productive elements or lexicalized.
A well documented suffix forming abstract and concrete nouns from verbs is
-at(t)-as intapp-att-‘destruction’fromtapir-‘to destroy’seu-att-‘heir’fromseu-‘to inherit’The element is preserved as -afti in ModernNobiin. According to Werner(1987:91) and Lepsius (1880:29), -atti marks a person, but has a negative connotation in most of the cases, as in
banp-atti*babbler’frombanp-‘to speak’di-atti
mark-atti‘murderer’
‘thief?from
fromdimark-‘to die’
‘to steal, to rob’The negative connotation doesn’t correspond to the Old Nobiin examples. There,
however, we find the denominative and deverbative agent formant -katti which
produces comparable nouns, such as48uk-katt-/ur-katt-‘oppressor, enemy’fromur“to (op)press’”nape-katt‘sinner’fromnape‘sin’The last example is also listed by Lepsius (1880:367) as
nabce-gatti‘sinner’Another similar derivation with a negative connotation in Modern Nobiin is
marja-gatti‘liar’frommarja‘lie, wrong’Old Nobiin -Xatt- is not restricted to pejorative contexts as other examples show.
The same holds true for Modern Nobiin. Both Lepsius and Wemer noted words
ending in -atti in the vocabularies which do not fall in this semantic category, but
are not accounted for. Examples are
fag-atti
till-atti
unn-atti‘half?
‘sweat’
‘progeny’from
from
fromfagtillunn-‘to divide’
‘to sweat”
‘to bear, to give birth to”Old Nobiin pak-katt- ‘share, half? from pag- ‘to share’ shows that an original
-katti might have been reduced in these examples. unnatti is not documented in
Old Nobiin, and (ilatti is only found in a doubtful instance in IT III 39.24 where
Browne (1996:171) tentatively translates ‘bosom’.","[48, 49]"
"1189. PeriphrasticsOld Nobiin had a wide range of periphrastic constructions which were lost in the
course of the development towards the modernlanguage. Browne (1982:26ff.;1989:27ff.) was the first to group the different constructions under the heading
“periphrastics” without, however, giving any detailed analysis of the specifieduses of the forms. Old Nobiin periphrastics have in common that they are formed
by attaching in- ‘to be’ or its equivalent to a participle, predicative or indicative.
The resulting constructions are demonstrated with the verb doll- ‘to love’:
Participle periphrasticsdoll-il in-Predicative periphrastics
Indicative periphrasticsdoll-ira indoll-ina in-Different verbs or elements which presumably have a verbal origin can take the
place of in- ‘to be’. Not all of them can be found in all three types of periphrastic
construction. The following chart shows the different verbal elements and their
distribution:
-men-/-min-(a)n-‘not to be’, negation
‘to become’, inchoative(part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)
(part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)-g(a/i)r-ke-/-ki-/-k-causative
habitual(part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)
(part. per.)-in-‘to be’(part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)-dal-/dar-dul-au-k(a)n-‘to be’

‘to be’(part.
(part.

(part.per, pred. per.)
per., pred. per.)
per.)
per.)-kinn-‘be without’(part. per.)-medd-“to be full’(pred. per.)-ok-‘to be’(part. per.)Browne (1989:27) at first regarded the periphrastic indicative as an emphaticvariant of the non-periphrastic construction which is semantically comparable to
the admirative, the other two he interpreted as mere stylistic variants of the nonperiphrastic constructions. After a more thorough analysis of the data at hand
(Browne 1991:60) he explained the indicative periphrastics with in- and men- as
focus constructions. Participle and predicative periphrastics he regarded as being119employed to topicalize the verb and “thus to yield the O.N. equivalent of a cleftsentence, either substantival or adjectival” (Browne 1991:60).
There is, however, another aspect to be considered here. Four of the elementsmentioned above are part of periphrastic constructions with clearly defined
grammaticalfunctionsasnegative,inchoative,causative,andhabitual/imperfective. There is no non-periphrastic alternative to these periphrastics. In
this, they differ from constructions with other verbal elements. From the perspective of Modern Nobiin, these are of special importance because they are preserved, though no longer as periphrastics.
As the first four constructions will be discussed in detail in the following
chapters, some examples of periphrastic constructions with other elements will
be given below.","[118, 119, 120]"
"17]10.8 “Perfect(ive)”
This construction originates in a verbal complex with the verb kon-/kun-/ko- ‘to
have’ (all three alternative forms are already present in Old Nobiin) as secondverb. Such a complex is absent in the religious-theological texts, but Zyhlarz
(1928:167) was the first to notice two examples of this complex as part of a graf-fito in Jebel Adda published by Griffith (1913:64ff.). The second verb follows
the adjunctive -a- suffixed to the first verb and is marked as 34 person singular
present subjunctive or indicative.

find a total of five instances for kon-/kun-/ko- as second element in a complex in
a corpus of 32 texts of different lengths. All examples but one are from personal
letters or requests, one comes from a commercial transaction.","[171, 172]"
"It can be summarized that the preterit of Modern Nobiin has obviously assumed
most of the functions of the two preterits of the older variant. At the same time,
however, a form emerged which most authors called the perfect. In the negative,this innovated form completely replaced the old preterit which will be discussed
later. In Old Nobiin, two forms of the preterit are found. The so-called preterit I
seems to have been more rarely used than preterit II. This might be one of thereasons why only the endings of the 2.4 and 34 person singular were retained when
the paradigms for preterit I and II finally merged into one. The difference between
the two preterits is difficult to determine in the indicative and non-existent in the83subjunctive. Interestingly, in the predicative only preterit | is found. Most of the
time, the distinction between the preterits is blurred which indicates that the proc-ess of merger and loss had already begun. Some of the functions of the preterits
were later assumed by innovated verbal forms which will be discussed later.","[83, 84]"
"He describes the suffix as emphatic particle. Besides the forms mentioned there
are additional ones for the 34 person singular and plural:
SG
SG-o/anaso
-ame(preterit I)PL
PL-ouanaso
-isaname(preterit I)
(preterit II)The preterit I + II forms represent the indicative + -so or -me. The remainingsingular form seems to consist of predicative -a + -me.
The negative imperative takes the negative auxiliary -men/-min. There is another form which Browne (1989:30) calls “vetitive”.
SG-a-ta-me, -a-ta-mPL-a-tan-ke-(so)The suffix -ta- which characterizes the vetitive is also present in connection with
the negation in -men which it seems to intensify.",[88]
"The particle -is-, often reduced to -s-, may also take verbal suffixes, as in:
is-sana (i. ¢. is-rana 3PLPREIND)‘whatever/whoever they are’s-ena (i.e. is-ena 3SGPRESIND)‘is it...2?, what is...?’s-il‘who is...?’(i, €. is-il PARTPRES)The last example is only documented in one of the personal letters of Qasr Ibrim
(although there might be one arguable instance in the Stauros text; Zyhlarz1928:43) and seems to be evidence for the development to Modern Nobiin. In
the more informal context of letters, we also find combinations of min-/men- and
-is- which probably are evidence of a more colloquial variant of Old Nobiin:(IT 1123.1)
made56milletmin-is-enawhat-INTERROG-3SGPRESIND‘what about the 56 (artabs of) millet?’(IT II] 48.2)
men-s-enawhat-INTERROG-3SGPRESIND‘what is it?’In Modern Nobiin, these complex forms are not present. The interrogative particle -is-, however, is preserved in a form which has to be analyzed. The followingformations can be found in the various texts and dictionaries:
siddo
sikkir
sille
siddoton
sikkeel(do ‘place’)
(kir ‘manner’)
(INTERROGPART -lc ?)
(do ‘place’, -ton ‘from’)
(keel ‘end, boundary, limit”)‘where?’
‘how?’
‘who?’
‘where from?’
‘how long?, how big?’sillog(-log ‘with, by, through’)‘from where?’sin(n)(GEN marker -n)‘whose?’60It is evident from the geminated middle consonants of the interrogatives that it
can not be the simple particle -(j)s- which is preserved in Modern Nobiin. Instead, it seems to be Old Nobiin s-i/ ‘who is...?’, the interrogative particle
marked as present participle, which provided the basis for the modern forms. The
geminated consonants are the result of regular assimilation processes.

sinnIn summary, it can be noted that in the system of pronouns no basic changes haveoccurred. The loss of inclusive/exclusive distinction with the personal pronouns
is the most noticeable one. Reduction of plural marking at the demonstrativescorresponds to the general changes in nominal plural marking which took place
in the course of the development from Old to Modern Nobiin. Concerning the
interrogatives, some changes which finally led to the modern pronouns were
already observable in the Old Nobiin texts. To these belong the use of -m/(i)i‘why’ and the development of s-i/ ‘who is...?’ combined with different postpositional elements.","[60, 61]"
"22613.4 The Kingdom of Dotawo
As has been mentioned above, a Lower Nubian kingdom existed until the end of
the 15th century which was called Dotawo. At the beginning, scientific researchproceeded on the assumption that Dotawo was a kind of successor state founded
after the Arab occupation of Dongola. The written evidence found at Qasr Ibrim,
however, documents the name Dotawo in a royal proclamation as early as 1156
(Browne 1991:3). Other references date from the 12t to the 14th centuries, andafter a gap of more than one hundred years, the final reference mentions a king
of Dotawo in 1464 (Plumley 1978). Against this background, it seems remarkable that the Arab writers not once mention Dotawo in their accounts of Nubian
history.
This lack of written evidence gave cause for different speculations concerning
the position and significance of Dotawo in the context of Medieval Nubia. The
discussion concentrated on two rather different assumptions:1. Dotawo was a petty kingdom within Nobatia but was subordinate to dominating Makuria.
2. Dotawo is the Nubian name for the kingdom of Makuria mentioned in Arabsources,
On the basis of the written sources, it can be stated that Dotawo’s main language
was Old Nobiin. The name itself has been interpreted as consisting of a toponymDo and the postposition fawo ‘below’. Do was equated with modern Adda and
Daw of Arab sources. Thus, Dotawo is supposed to mean ‘(the country) below
Do’ (Adams 1977:535; Vantini 1981:199). This etymology is based on the assumptions that Dotawo’s status actually was one of a petty kingdom and that its
capital was Adda. Sudanese archaeologist Ali Osman (1982:194) proposed an
alternative etymology of the name. He interprets it as a compound noun consisting of doro ‘above (= south)’ and tawo ‘below (= north)’ and equates Dotawo
with Makuria and Nobatia/Makuria of Arab sources respectively.
The discussion about the identity of Dotawo is exemplary for the sometimesuncritical approach to historical sources concerning Nubia. Although historians
like Adams noticed the discrepancies in the sources of different origin no conclusion was drawn, obviously because alternative interpretations would not have
fitted the traditional reconstruction of historical processes.","[226, 227]"
"Excurse 2: The Origin of a Complementizer in Nobiin
According to Lepsius (1880:139ff.) the endings -ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion are often
attached to the positive and negative imperative. He interprets these suffixes asalternative and arbitrary forms of a subordinating conjunction. Their use with the
imperative/jussive, he continues, is determined by the conception of these con-structions as dependent or subordinate. They can be suffixed to any verbal ending without changing its meaning and function. Lepsius distinguishes these endings from identical suffixes he calls shortened and enclitic forms of the verb iig‘to say’ which he describes as used parenthetically in narratives corresponding toLatin inquam, inquit ‘I said, he said’ (Lepsius 1880:330). Abel (1913:15ff.) has
shown that the two are identical. In his Ermenne narrative these endings are
found as -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye and documented about one hundred times withintwo hundred sentences. Werner (1987:383) mentions the variants -yon/-ayon/
-eyon in his wordlist. He calls the forms “‘subordinating morphemes”, but doesn’tdiscuss their function in his grammar. Although Werner speaks of “subordinating
morpheme”, he adds the translation ‘he said’ to the three variants.
Lepsius, Werner and Abel agree that the endings originate in the verb iig-,
shortened i- ‘to say’ and that the different forms have to be regarded as clitics.
Looking at Old Nobiin we find evidence that originally two verbs with the meaning of ‘to say’, igir-/ig- and il(d)- were present. Only il(d)- was occasionally
reduced to i-. The endings therefore can be traced back to the latter and do not
originate in igir-/ig- which is still present as independent verb in Modern Nobiin.
The process which the commentaries of the different authors indicate resem-bles the one described e. g. by Lord (1976) for West African Kwa languages
where the verb ‘to say’ is reinterpreted as a subordinator, which was probably
first used with complement clauses and was later extended to other clause types.
According to Lord the process begins when a general verb meaning ‘to say’ is90used to reinforce other verbs of saying in the so-called matrix clause. This is the
case in most of the examples from the Ermenne narrative which have the general
verb jig- ‘to say’ reinforced by -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye, as in(Erm. 20)

the Ermenne text:

sentence above, each statement is completed by -ayon or -eyon. It can be concluded that the endings not only reinforce the verb ‘to say’, but generally mark
direct speech, although they are not obligatory.","[90, 91]"
"In the last lines of document36, we get to knowaboutthe fee for the scribe who was paid in kind. He was supposed to receive one kolin tewiti which corresponds to modern Dongolese/Kenzi kal deewdi ‘flat bread’.
kol- is merely a variant of kal- described above. The alternative use of vowels o
and a is documented again in the same text with kap- and kop- ‘to eat’.
In the documentary text from Qasr Ibrim, it can be observed that foreign words
or loanwords from Arabic enter into Old Nobiin. In the sales contract IT III 36, the
Arabic word ouati ‘wadi, valley’ is used, only documented in one other instancein Sale 9 as wati. The use of Arabic wadi is remarkable because regarding the
modern languages, it is restricted to Kenzi. In Nobiin, we find the original farki
or the much more common Arabic loan khor both meaning ‘valley’. Armbruster
(1965:103) lists the latter in the form hoor also for Dongolese.
Finally, egeti ‘kettle’ is another word which is found only in this text and in
modemKenzi, but not in Modern Nobiin.",[21]
"What has been called innovated future in the title of this chapter fulfills several functions in the tense, aspect and modal system of Nobiin. The few examples from Old Nobiin which indicate something about the origin of the innova-tion consist of religious predictions which seem to have the status of intentionals.
In Moder Nobiin, examples for the whole range of tense/aspect/modal markingcan be found. When there is a temporal specification fa- may function as future
tense marker. Without temporal reference, the element regularly marks an intentional. In the translation of the gospel, propheciesand predictionsare docu-mented which correspond to those in the Old Nobiin texts. This leads over to the
frequent use of /a- in irrealis constructions which can also be observed with the
conditional. In addition, fa- is used in different kinds of constructions where
modal verbs are necessary in English. Finally, fa- is restricted to the function as
irrealis when used with the preterit.",[163]
"In each case, an actual stative meaningseems to be involved. In contrast, constructions with fii- missing often express
situations that have already been terminated at the time of speaking or any other
reference time, as in

irtrealis formations.
Besides the constructions with da- ‘to be’ discussed above, Abel’s Ermennenarrative contains examples for stative constructions comparative to those found
in Lepsius’ gospel. The following sentence may serve as an example:

"It is difficult to trace the origin of the innovated future/intentional in Old Nobiin where the old one is still fully productive. Interestingly, it is in two of the
theological texts that we find clues to the genesis of the new future/intentional.
The two examples support Lepsius’ idea as to the origin of the future prefix fa-which he developed without any knowledge of Old Nobiin.

The following pronouns function as the subject of a clause. In Old Nobiin, the
so-called juncture vowel -u- could be suffixed. For the 1st person plural, Old
Nobiin had a distinction between inclusive and exclusive. This distinction is lost
in ModemNobiin which only retained the former exclusive -u-. Otherwise, thesubject pronouns remained unchanged.

teriiWerner presumed that the suffix might be an eroded remnant of the Old Nobiin
case marker -i/. As, however, the subject pronouns are not marked for case in Old
Nobiin this is highly improbable. A semantic difference between the two sets is
not indicated by the texts. It seems possible that the -i/-ii suffix is a former juncture vowel. As has been described above we find an annective -u or -i between
elements which closely cohere. This can be the case with appositions and attributives but it also optionally binds postpositions to the preceding nouns or phrases
and pronouns to the rest of the sentences. Although most examples show the
vowel -u, -i can occasionally be found:53(IT1412)

even in Old Nobiin, the juncture vowel is more often missing than present andthat the unmotivated changes between -u and -i may actually indicate some sort
of neutral vowel, such as a. Here, we find two counter-arguments against the
proposed origin of the second set of modern subject pronouns.","[52, 53, 54]"
