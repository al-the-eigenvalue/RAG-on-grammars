Questions and negation
This chapter takes as its starting point the semantic fields of questions and negation and
looks at the kinds of constructions used to express them. The expression of questions
and negation in Lavukaleve involves some use of focus constructions, as well as other
syntactic strategies not involving morphologically-marked focus.
Questions are expressed in one of two main ways: either by using a specific questionword, or by just using a focus construction. Even those clauses using specific question
words are frequently expressed using focus constructions.
There are various ways to negate different kinds of constituents: including the Negative
verbal suffix -la, the particle tamu ÔnoÕ; the intransitive verb tave Ôbe notÕ; the negative
imperative expressed by the Admonitive suffix; and other negative lexical items.
Frequently, negative predications are expressed using a focus construction. The use of
focus constructions in the areas of questions and negation is a very characteristic feature
of Lavukaleve, and indeed of other languages which have grammaticalised focus
structures.
The first part of this chapter discusses the syntactic structures used to express questions,
and also all the interrogative lexical items in the language. It also discusses how positive
and negative polar questions are answered. The second part of the chapter presents a
discussion of all aspects of negation, including the role of the focus markers in negative
clauses. The morphological, syntactic and pragmatic features of focus constructions are
discussed in Chapter 11.
17.1 QUESTIONS
In Lavukaleve, questions are very often phrased using a focus construction. There are
40717 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATIONalso a number of question words which may be used, either in a focus construction or
not. All questions are marked, not only by syntactic and lexical means, but also by a
distinctive rising intonation. Questions can be divided into two functional and syntactic
types: polar questions and content questions.
As was shown in Section 11.7, there are three focus markers in Lavukaleve: feo, the
default focus marker; meo, the focus marker used in polar questions; and heo, the focus
marker used, among other things, in content questions. See the above-mentioned
chapter for a full discussion of the focus markers and their syntactic and semantic
functions.
The sole use of the meo focus marker, then, is in marking focus in polar questions.
Content questions usually use a question word, usually with a focus marker. If the focus
marker is present, it is heo, and it agrees with the questioned item. The following
sections discuss in turn polar questions and then content questions.
17.1.1 P OLAR QUESTIONSPolar questions are framed using a focus construction involving the meo focus marker,
with the focus marker agreeing with the questioned element. Since questioned elements
are focussed, by definition, one would expect questions to be expressed using morphosyntactically marked focus in a language in which this is available, and this is indeed
what happens in Lavukaleve. Some examples (there are many more in Section 11.7):

Section 17.1.2 explains how the answers to these and other questions are phrased.
Note that the focus marker does not move to the initial position in questions; rather, it
remains in the position in which it would be if the sentence were not a question. There
are a couple of examples in which the focus marker appears in initial position. For
instance:
5)Minu

-sgmna
na
sgmArthin?
hin
3sgmEFOCWas it you (m) who was cruel to my mother, putting her there and leaving her and going?
gm 102This is not an example of movement of the focus marker, as there is no other place in
the sentence where the focus marker would be expected to be. Rather, it is an example
of ellipsis of the argument with which the focus marker is in construction; inu Ôyou
(2sg)Õ. This, and another sentence structurally almost identical to it from the same story,
is the only example of such ellipsis in the corpus. It is not clear whether the possibility
is to do with the fact that the sentence is a question.
Incidentally, this is also one of the rare examples of a focus-echo construction using the
meo focus marker. Note that the second (and third, in fact) focus markers agree in
gender and number but not person with the first. See Section 11.5.1 for an explanation
of focus-echo constructions.
17.1.2 A NSWERS TO POLAR QUESTIONSPolar questions can be phrased both positively and negatively, as the examples above
have shown. Positive answers to positive polar questions are expressed by iire ÔyesÕ.
Negative answers to positive questions are expressed by tamu ÔnoÕ. The particle comes
first, in its own sentence intonation unit, then a longer sentential answer may follow.
For example the answer to the question in (2) Is it here you want to stay? is as follows:
40917 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATION
6)""Tamu.
tamu
noKanifa
kanifa
along.a.bitmail
mail
a.bitkoi"".
koi
also""No. A bit further again"".b1 030Questions phrased positively are neutral as to whether they expect a positive or negative
answer. However questions phrased negatively expect a positive answer. For example
the question in (4) above The giant here didnÕt eat you? was asked when a boy
reappeared in his village after a long absence. The village people had assumed he had
been eaten by the giant, but seeing him they realised he must not have been, and thus
asked the question knowing that it would receive a positive answer: the giant had not
eaten him. The boyÕs answer is as follows:
7)Tamu.
tamu
noNgaulam
nga- u -la
1sgO- eat -NEG-m
-sgmfin.
fin
3sgmFOCNo. He didn't eat me.mn2 058As the example shows, positive answers to negative questions are expressed with the
negative particle.
Even though negative questions expect a positive answer, it is possible to give a
negative answer to a negative question. This is done using a particle oman Ôon the
contraryÕ. A negative answer to the above question (Q: The giant didnÕt eat you? A:
The giant ate me (which would only make sense if the boy was now a ghost for
example)) could be expressed in the following way, using oman and a positive
sentence:
8)Oman.

shown in Section 11.7 that if a content question employs a focus construction, the focus
marker used will be the heo focus marker. The heo focus marker in questions works as
in focus constructions, but the element it is questioning is the element it expresses focus
on, using the agreement system outlined in Chapter 11.","[431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436]"
"28211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSLavukaleve works exactly like accent prosody in English. In English predicate focus
constructions, there is an accent on the object. In Lavukaleve predicate focus
constructions, the focus marker agrees with the object. In English sentence focus
constructions, there is an accent on the subject, because sentence focus marking is in
paradigmatic opposition to predicate focus marking. In Lavukaleve sentence focus
constructions, the focus marker agrees with the subject. In both languages, sentence
focus marking operates in paradigmatic opposition to predicate focus marking.
11.7 THE THREE FOCUS MARKERS FEO, HEO AND MEO
The three focus markers are associated with different sentence types. In the next sections
the three focus markers will be discussed and exemplified. All three of the focus markers
are used in the constructions described above, expressing predicate, sentence and
argument focus.
THE MEO FOCUS MARKERMeo is used only in polar questions. It agrees in person, number and gender with the
questioned element:

the other is to express strong emphasis. There are some syntactic environments which
require the use of heo. These environments are: content questions, the second focus
marker of a focus-echo construction, focus clauses which contain a foia demonstrative
pronoun, and focus clauses in which a constituent is emphasised using the emphatic
particle ta. In these environments, if any focus marker is used it must be heo rather than
meo or feo. In other environments, heo may be used to express strong emphasis. This
is particularly the case with contrastive emphasis, which is almost always expressed using
heo. For this pragmatic purpose, feo may be always used instead of heo, but if it is, the
strong emphasis reading associated with heo will be lost.
·Content questionsHeo contrasts with meo in that while they are both used to form questions, meo is only
used in polar questions and heo is only used in content questions. Compare the two
focus markers in the example below, which is taken from natural conversation. The
speaker was trying to make out the identity of a dark figure approaching the house one
night:

3.17.2 QUESTION PARTICLESQuestion particles include the following: ria~dia Ôwhere?Õ; riahi~diahi Ôwhere to?Õ (the
r-initial and d-initial forms vary freely; see Section 2.10); ninam Ôwhen?Õ; and vala
Ôhow, what, why?Õ, a general interrogative. These particles all occur as the first word of
a question sentence.
Other question words are intransitive verbs vasia Ôbe where?Õ and ela Ôbe how many?Õ;
masculine nouns ami Ôwho?Õ; man Ôwhat?Õ; elahave Ôhow much?Õ; and the plural noun
elav Ôhow many?Õ. Question particles and other question words are discussed in Section
17.1.
3.17.3 TIME PARTICLESThere are three time particles. They are: kosora ÔtodayÕ; raine ÔtomorrowÕ; marigen
ÔyesterdayÕ. Note also there is a word movele Ôthe day after tomorrowÕ, which is a
neuter noun. There is no word for Ôthe day before yesterdayÕ.
3.17.4 QUANTIFIER PARTICLESThere are only two quantifier particles; suni ÔallÕ and mail Ôa bitÕ. Other concepts from
this semantic area are expressed by words of other word classes, e.g. vutia Ôbe manyÕ
(intransitive verb); ro-ru ÔnoneÕ (adjective ro ÔoneÕ with negative suffix); fatu ÔhalfÕ
(noun); viluril ÔmostÕ (derived verb); and fan ÔsomeÕ (noun). They function as adjuncts
of verbs.
3.17.5 V OCATIVE PARTICLESThere are three vocative particles, which appear at the end of sentences, and provide
illocutionary force to the utterance. Typically they occur with commands and
exhortations. The three particles are na (vocative, singular), nail (vocative, dual) and
nai (vocative, plural). The particles are always spoken as the final word of an utterance,
after an intonation break (indicated below by the slash and comma respectively in the
following examples), and they always receive very strong stress. Their use is only
possible in very informal circumstances. Note that I have translated them as ÔyouÕ,
which, in this context, seems like the closest functional equivalent in English. They do
not, however, make any reference to person, and are not to be understood as pronouns
of any sort. Some examples:
16)E!
e
hey!","[87, 88]"
"25811 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSverb+object constituent; she expresses focus on the whole event of doing what her
husband wants.
The next example is taken from a story about a giant who tricks two boys into letting him
steal their pig. He offers to butcher it for them, and as he cuts it up, he throws away each
bit of meat into the river, saying it is not fit for eating, until there is no more edible meat
left. The two boys donÕt realise that the giant has previously tied a bag in the river
downstream, and thus all the discarded bits of pig meat are being collected safely in his
bag, while they themselves end up with nothing. In the sentence below, the giant has
thrown away all the flesh, and only the intestines are left. The speaker expresses this with
focus on giving the bad bits:

(verb plus object), not just on the object. If speakers wish to focus on an object argument,
they use a Sentence-Internal focus construction (described in Section 11.3.3), with a
focus marker in construction with the object, as in the following example. In this
example, the focus marker occrs immediately after the object, not after the verb, and the
verb does not have the Agreement Suffix agreeing with the object:

co 052SENTENCE FOCUS IN TRANSITIVE SENTENCESThe next set of examples show transitive sentences with focus marker agreement with the
subject NP; these express sentence focus. Focus on a whole sentence is highly marked,
25911 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSand generally only used when the whole sentence contains unexpected or surprising
information, or is presentational. The following example is the opening sentence to a
story about the origins of the village Losiolen. The sentence focus is accounted for by the
presentational context.

fk 001Sentence focus is also used in situations where something happens counter to
expectations. In the next sentence the speaker has just been startled by an arrow landing
next to her with no warning, and then is further surprised to see the addressee, who had
sneaked up behind her. She asks the question, expressing surprise that the man in front of
her might own the arrow, although it is clear that she had no expectation of who the
owner is (so this isnÕt contrastive focus):

obey their chiefs, and contrasting that with the perceived disobedience in villages now.
He uses sentence focus in this sentence for a strong statement, that those people then
obeyed the chiefsÕ word, which makes an explicit contrast with the people of today. The
speaker is talking to an audience of younger people, and he is perhaps slightly defensively
making a strong point, using the marked sentence focus construction, to achieve this.

today know their clan, not like the people before who didnÕt know what clan they
belonged to. This is seen as a crucial difference between olden days, when only chiefs
knew what clan people belonged to, and now; because knowing what clan you belong to
means, among other things, that you have the knowledge to fight about land ownership.","[284, 285, 286]"
"41817 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATIONÔbe notÕ, and was discussed in Section 3.2.3. It is not a serial verb construction, because
the subject of a serial verb construction can be marked only once across the whole
predicate, not once on each verb as here. For the same reason it cannot be any other type
of complex predicate. Syntactically such sequences of verbs are considered to be two
independent clauses in succession. Such constructions only occur with verbs tave and
tuna; in all other cases, clauses in sequence must be overtly marked for their
relationship with each other, either as subordinate-dependent or coordinate-dependent
or coordinated independent clauses.
17.2.3 RO-RU ÔNOT ONEÕThe suffix -ru only appears on the adjective ro (cited here in its feminine singular
form). Ro means ÔoneÕ; ro-ru means Ônot oneÕ. The suffixed ro word is used to negate a
noun. It very frequently negates mina ÔthingÕ; thus mina roru ÔnothingÕ. A clause
containing an NP negated with ro-ru must appear with a further clausal negator. Thus,
if the clause is verbal, the verb must be negated using verbal suffix -la. If the clause is
non-verbal, it must be negated with the negative particle tamu ÔnotÕ.

17.2.4 TAMU ÔNOTÕThe particle tamu negates an entire clause or an NP. It appears postposed to a positive
clause and negates the proposition of that clause, or, as discussed above, it provides an
answer to a negative question. The difference between using a tamu construction and
using the verbal suffix -la or tave Ôbe notÕ, which have the same propositional effect,

Discourse organisation
Most of the previous chapters have dealt with the structures and functions of sentences
and their component parts. This chapter aims to show some aspects of how these
sentences, once built, are actually used in Lavukaleve. The chapter is in two separate
parts. The first part examines how sentences are joined together in discourse, looking at
typical Lavukaleve ways of structuring discourse in narratives for textual cohesion. The
kinds of methods to be discussed are not grammaticalised structures, but rather, common
and idiomatic ways of choosing to structure a discourse, and as such are an important part
of how the language works. The second part discusses reference tracking. Other parts of
the description have shown what linguistic material is available in Lavukaleve to introduce
and track referents in narratives. This section shows how these different types of
linguistic material interact, and how they are used across a narrative, rather than just
across a sentence. It also shows that very often participant tracking is not a priority, and
instead there frequently exists a high degree of ambiguity about the identity of referents.
18.1 W AYS OF JOINING SENTENCES INTO LARGER UNITS
There are three main ways by which sentences are joined into larger discourse units in
Lavukaleve. Very commonly, head/tail linkage is used, in which the final verb of one
sentence is repeated as the first verb of the next sentence (Section 18.1.1). Also very
common is the use of Ôdiscourse-linkage verbsÕ, a strategy in which generic verbs such as
ÔdoÕ are used to link a sentence to the previous one (Section 18.1.2). Thirdly,
conjunctions can be used to link sentences together in a temporal or causal sequence
(Section 18.1.3).","[444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449]"
"2028 - D EICTICSThese demonstrative identifiers are very rare. They are used to make a predication about
the location of an entity in space. That is, while the singular proximal neuter
demonstrative pronoun foga means Ôit, proximal neuter singularÕ, fohoga means Ôit is
here, proximal neuter singularÕ. They can only occur in non-verbal clauses, functioning
as non-verbal predicates, often with ellipsed subjects. They are most commonly heard in
answer to the question Ôwhere?Õ:

17.1.4 CONTENT QUESTIONS USING INTERROGATIVE LEXICAL ITEMSContent questions are often phrased in focus constructions using specific interrogative
lexical items. These interrogative words belong to various word classes, and thus have
different syntactic properties. The full list is as follows:

word of a clause. For instance, it cannot form a complex predicate with the Habitual

not with a verbal prefix (see Section 10.5). Some examples:

My primary debt is to the many Lavukaleve speakers who made the effort to talk to me
and teach me their language. IÕm only sorry I was such a slow learner. It was the people
of the West Russells, and Mane Village in particular, who made this work possible, by
letting me live with them and making the effort to talk with me, even though I was clearly
a freak and possibly dangerous. Especially important were Chief Nicholas Sobo, his wife
Fane Navo, and two of their daughters, Marion Kuu and Nesta Kelavi. Fane Novo
overcame her shyness to be one of my few monolingual teachers. Marion and Nesta often
fed me, particularly in the beginning, and Marion kept me company for the first few
months when everyone else was too afraid to talk to me. My neighbours Emily Mavaua
and Colin Pawa also kept an eye on me, and the kids, especially Maureen and her gang of
little girls were brilliant teachers.
But my biggest helpers were Patterson Barua, and his wife Monica Felakoe Elufua, and
daughter Christa Kanefa. Patterson in particular taught me almost everything I know
about Lavukaleve, and everything I know about doing linguistics in the field. Monica fed
me and looked after me and made sure I was never in want of anything she could provide,
and Christa carried buckets of water. In a village with no water supply, this is no small
favour.
Also the people of Baesen, my other home, deserve my thanks, in particular the former
headmaster of Flahaba School, Stanley Sade, and also Chief Clement Savaka, Nancy,
Emily Fofokolin and Dora Iho and her husband, and their mother Salome Vavara, who
welcomed me into their homes when I first arrived in the Russells. Their warmth and
friendliness helped me through many a hard day. Also the people of Losiolen, Hae,
Louna, Alokan and particularly Karumulun who talked to me, especially Chief Raymond
Kolo, Julian Beglin, Janet Tokilo and Hilda Bungu. Also my other family in Yandina,
Ben Rabe and Hannah Kuatavea, and in Honiara, Anne Sade and her family. I am
particularly grateful to Hannah for looking after me whenever I was waiting in Yandina
for transport, which happened a lot, and to Ben for letting me make free with his canoe.
And of course, thank you to Michael Boliko, and also Addeson and Niko for driving me
round in BenÕs canoe any time I wanted, providing me with much interesting
entertainment on the way.
vAlso thank you to the people who told me the stories which provided the data for this
thesis. It is trite to say that without these people there would have been no thesis, but
nevertheless, each one of them made the effort to tell a story to the foreigner with the
machine, and this is gratefully acknowledged. Those who havenÕt already been mentioned
are: Abel Moran, Ann Onutu, Christian Hill, Clement Oiva, Edward Getu, Ethel Mary
Kanefa, Frank Koau, Georgina Makikifaria, Honiara Resman, James Nepolo, John
Hubert, John Nate, Kilaev Gulum, Matthew Ngele, Donald Ofiva, Melchior Pitu, Mase
Toto, Laurence Soitam, Sarah Kiko, Edwin Vefele, Wilson Ngara, William Fox, and
especially Mostin Nekuiga, whose willingness to tell stories about giants was exceeded
only by my willingness to record them.
Certain other people who were in Honiara at one time or another also receive my thanks,
including Evizel Seymour, Rachael Gooberman, and Matthew Bowden, variously for
either putting me up, or putting up with me, or both.
And back in Canberra, thanks to my friends, specially Catriona Hyslop, Bethwyn Evans,
Eva Lindstršm, Kazuko Obata, Tony Liddicoat, and Tim Curnow. During the last six
months, the PhD students at MPI Nijmegen entertained me and eased me into a new
culture, and they include Anna Margetts, Birgit Hellwig and Mandana Seyfeddinipur.
Back in Canberra again, thanks to my mother Pamela and my brother Simon, who both
visited me in the field, and made me see again with new eyes things that I had already
become used to. Thanks also to my mother for never-ending support of every possible
kind. Thanks to my brother Greg too, a prime example of how to never let a PhD get in
the way of having a good time. And huge thanks go to my best friend Michael Dunn, who
is always equally happy to read a chapter or give me a belay, and just as patient at both.
Making an appearance at the beginning of the project was Mark Donohue, who made a
major tactical error when he cut out pages 816-819 of the copy he gave me of Todd
(1975) in the hope that I wouldnÕt notice how interesting Lavukaleve looked. I noticed.
Evelyn Todd herself was a very important figure in the beginning, generously sharing her
Lavukaleve data with me before I had been to the Russells.
I would also like to thank my supervisors: in the Department of Linguistics, in the
Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, where I was based, was my main
supervisor Malcolm Ross, who can spot an Austronesian loan from 50 metres; as well as
Andy Pawley (all faults of style in this work are despite his best efforts); and Darrell
Tryon, who initially made me welcome in RSPAS. Sasha Aikhenvald from the Research
Centre for Linguistic Typology could always be relied on for boundless enthusiasm. Tim
Curnow again, also from the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology, made a stylish
last-minute appearance of inestimable value. In this paragraph also belong my thanks to
Nikolaus Himmelmann, who was never my supervisor, but who nevertheless did an
awful lot of supervising.
viThanks also to Gerrit Dimmendaal, David Wilkins and Bill McGregor for reading and
commenting on chapters. Also I would like to thank the Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, who provided a working environment
during the last six months of my PhD. I suspect I got a far better deal than they did from
my presence here.
There are also lots of people who are or were based in the Linguistics Department in the
Faculty of Arts at the ANU, who helped make me the kind of linguist I have become.
Whether or not theyÕd be happy with the result so far I donÕt know, but Bob Dixon,
Harold Koch, Ulrike Mosel and Anna Wierzbicka were the ones who initially gave me the
inspiration. Mind you, Ulrike said it would not be possible to write a grammar of this
language without speakers living in Canberra. Up until almost the last minute, I
completely agreed with her.viiviiiAbstract
The thesis is in five major parts. The first part, Preliminaries, deals with the basic
building blocks on which the grammar is founded; the introductory chapter, the
phonology and the word classes.
The second part of the thesis deals with arguments and adjuncts. Chapter 4 outlines Noun
Phrase structure and the structure of possessive constructions. Chapter 5 and 6 deal with
issues inherent to individual nouns; noun formation in Chapter 5 and gender and
agreement in Chapter 6. The morphological processes of noun formation are extremely
complex; for example there are at least 86 different ways of forming dual and plural
nouns. Chapter 7 discusses nominal adjuncts. Chapter 8 deals with the complex area of
deictics, one of the most structurally elaborated areas of the language. There are three
paradigms of demonstratives. One is a demonstrative modifier, and two are demonstrative
pronouns, which differ in their pragmatic reference; one is used to refer to an entity not
uppermost in the minds of the speaker and hearers, and the other is used elsewhere. The
relationship between the three demonstrative paradigms is complex and interesting, and is
dealt with in some detail. Presentative forms can be created from most of the deictics, as
can predicative deictics, by means of additional morphology.
The third part of the thesis concerns predicate structure. Basic clause structure and
principles of participant marking are outlined in Chapter 9. Constructions using the
Agreement Suffix are examined in Chapter 10. The Agreement Suffix, one of the
morphological means of marking participants, is a ubiquitous and important suffix in the
language. Focus constructions, discussed in Chapter 11, are another very elaborated area
of Lavukaleve morphosyntax. There are three paradigms of focus markers in Lavukaleve.
Many different types of constituents can be focussed: a predicate, a sentence, an NP or an
adjunct, including nominal adjuncts, adverbs, particles and non-main verbs. When
predicates and sentences are focussed, the focus marker is the final element of the
sentence. The agreement of the focus marker (with the person, gender and number of
either the subject or the object of the clause) shows the domain of focus. When arguments
and adjuncts are focussed, the focus marker appears immediately after the argument,
ixsentence-internally.
Chapter 12 deals with the expression of tense, aspect and mood. Chapter 13 deals with
valency changing, the creation of predicates from words of other classes, as well as other
word class-changing morphological processes. The final chapter of this part, Chapter 14,
outlines the types of complex predicates existing in the language, including serial verb
constructions, verb compounds, verb-adjunct constructions, and predicates involving the
Habitual Auxiliary.
The fourth part of the thesis deals with interclausal syntax: clause chaining constructions
(Chapter 15) and subordinate clauses (Chapter 16). There are three types of subordinate
clauses; one of them, subordinate adverbial clauses, involves a split-ergative marking
system. Most other areas of the language have nominative/accusative alignment. The final
part of the thesis, discourse organisation, aims to bring together some of the broader areas
of importance to Lavukaleve discourse. The expression of questions and negation is
described in Chapter 17. In Chapter 18 is a discussion of typical Lavukaleve ways of
structuring discourse in narratives for textual cohesion, and an examination of how
reference tracking devices operate across a larger section of narrative than a single
sentence.
An appendix containing two glossed texts forms the final part of this thesis.xContents

Word-level derivation: word class changing
and valency changing
Nominalisation is a common and productive process in Lavukaleve. There are two
different kinds of nominalisation: the very productive suffix -i ~ -e, which, added to verb
stems, derives an abstract noun; and the less productive -io, with a similar function.
Other word class changing phenomena are rare; there is a Locativiser suffix added to
verbs; adjectives can, rarely, be changed into verbs with the addition of the Causative
suffix; and there is a suffix that is attached to intransitive verbs to form adverbs.
There are a number of valency changing processes. The one valency increasing process is
the Causative construction, and there are three valency decreasing constructions: a
construction involving an Intransitiviser suffix -a; an Impersonal construction, and a
Reciprocal construction. There is in addition one construction which could be described
as valency rearranging, in which subjects of certain verbs are marked using prefixes from
the Possessive, not subject, prefix paradigm.
Note that as well as word-level derivation there is also phrasal-level word-class changing
in Lavukaleve. It was shown in Section 4.1.2 that the word mea ÔSPECifierÕ, normally
an adjective, has a non-adjectival use in which it can occur in construction with a particle
or a nominal adjunct to derive an NP or nominal modifier phrase. See the abovementioned chapter for discussion of this.
This chapter discusses in turn each of the word class changing and valency changing
constructions in Lavukaleve. The first section deals with nominalisations. The discussion
continues in the second section with other word class changing phenomena. The third
section deals with valency changing constructions. The final section discusses the valency
31713 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONrearranging Possessor-subject construction.
13.1 NOMINALISATION
13.1.1 THE NEUTER ABSTRACT NOMINALISER -E~-IThere are three methods by which verbs can be nominalised. Most common is the use of
the suffix -e~-i (glossed NOMZR). This is a very productive suffix, which can be added
to transitive or intransitive verbs.
This suffix is one of the few morphemes in Lavukaleve which is subject to a phonological
rule. Its form undergoes vowel harmony with the height of the previous vowel of the verb
to which it is suffixed:
verb ends in
-a, -o, -e
-u, iform of Nominaliser suffix
-e
-iNote that the rule of reduction of identical vowels at morpheme boundaries, which is a
general feature of the language (discussed in Section 2.9.3), comes into operation with
nominalised verbs which end in -e and -i. This rule means that in practice one cannot hear
the suffix when it is attached to a verb stem ending in /e/ or /i/. However, there is no zero
nominalisation in Lavukaleve, and all verbs ending in /a/, /u/ and /o/ must use this suffix in
order to become nouns; so it is no difficult matter to say that on verb stems ending in /e/
and /i/ the Nominaliser suffix is obligatorily used, then lost due to morphophonemic
processes. Some of the verbs in the table below illustrate this.
The Nominaliser suffix derives an abstract neuter noun from any transitive or intransitive
verb. Semantically, this is action/state nominalisation; that is, it is the kind of
nominalisation in which the derived noun expresses the name of the action or state
expressed by the verb (Comrie and Thompson 1985: 349).
For example, compare the following verbs with their corresponding derived nouns:
VERBDERIVED NOUNlo ÔfinishÕ
ve ÔgoÕ
honia ÔknowÕ
iru ÔsleepÕ (verb)
i ÔdoÕloe ÔendÕ
ve Ôgoing, wayÕ
honiae ÔknowledgeÕ
irui ÔsleepÕ (noun)
i ÔdeedÕThe fact that all nouns derived with this suffix are neuter is an example of morphological
gender assignment; but there is also a semantic association that many underived abstract
31813 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONnouns are of neuter gender. See Section 6.1 for a discussion of the principles of gender
assignment.
A verb suffixed with the Nominaliser suffix may carry with it any of the arguments and
adjuncts normally available to that verb, and carries cross-references for these arguments
with subject and/or object prefixes, as the principles of participant marking outlined in
Section 9.7 dictate.
Derived nouns have the following nominal features: they function as the heads of NPs,
and can thus appear with the definite article, they serve as arguments of verbs or
postpositions, and they may take the Locative suffix. The question of whether or not they
can take Possessive prefixes is a slightly complicated one, which requires some
discussion.
Nouns index possessors using a set of prefixes from the Possessive paradigm. This
nominal Possessive prefix paradigm is formally identical to the verbal subject prefix
paradigm except for one form. The 1st singular Possessive prefix is nga-, whereas the 1st
singular subject prefix is a-. Thus for most derived nouns appearing with a pronominal
prefix, one cannot tell whether the prefix is a Possessive or a subject prefix, as
theoretically it could be either. Some examples will make these points clear. Compare the
prefixes referring to 1st person singular with those referring to 3rd person plural:

-NOMZRSo derived nouns take subject prefixes, not Possessive prefixes. This leads to a further
point. The fact that a verb complete with subject and object prefix indexing can be
nominalised shows that the nominalising process happens after the verb has been indexed
31913 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONfor these arguments. That is, the bare verb stem is not nominalised; instead, the verb with
its arguments, which may be cross-referenced with prefixes, is nominalised. The

To conclude, then, verbs may carry verbal morphology and arguments of their own, and
they may retain these when they are nominalised. However once they have been
nominalised they also have the noun-like properties of functioning as the heads of NPs,
appearing with the definite article, serving as arguments of verbs and postpositions, and
taking the Locative and Perlative suffixes. They do not, however, take Possessive
prefixes.
The following examples illustrate some of these features. The first example shows a
derived noun suffixed with the Locative suffix, which, together with me ÔSPECÕ
functions as an adjective modifying nei ÔcoconutÕ (see Section 4.1.2 for a discussion of
the function of mea ÔSPECifierÕ).

Tense, aspect and mood
12.1 INTRODUCTION
All morphological categories of tense, aspect and mood (TAM) are marked by suffixes
on verbs (see Chapter 14 for discussion of how these suffixes operate in complex
predicates). There are two Tense categories: Present and Future; there are two Aspect
categories: Imperfective and Durative; and there are six Mood categories: Admonitive,
Durative Imperative, Punctual Imperative, Hortative, Abilitative and Extended.
TAM is not an obligatorily marked category; even when semantically appropriate, there
is no obligation for speakers to use it. Most TAM suffixes are incompatible with most
other verbal morphology.
Further, most of these affixes cannot combine with each other. The following table sets
out the TAM suffixes, and their combinatorial possibilities with other verbal
morphology:29512 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODCombinatorial Possibilities of TAM morphology

Number of subject is marked in the Present Tense suffix.
Rare.
The table makes clear that object cross-referencing is compatible with all TAM
morphology, but subject cross-referencing is much less so. Generally only one TAM
category can be marked per verb.
TAM is not the complex and elaborated area that it is in some East Papuan Phylum
languages, for instance Yele (Henderson 1995) or Motuna (Onishi 1994). In both of
these languages, there are highly elaborated TAM categories, expressed by extremely
complex agglutinative verbal morphology. LavukaleveÕs system, by contrast, is
relatively simple, with few contrasts and simple morphological means of expressing
them.
12.2 TENSE
There are two morphologically marked tense categories in Lavukaleve: the Present
Tense and the Future Tense. The Present Tense morphology contains information about
the number (sg/du/pl) of the subject, whereas the Future Tense marker just marks Future
Tense. Neither the Present Tense nor the Future Tense markers are obligatory in
contexts in which they are semantically appropriate, and in fact in many verb forms they29612 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODare disallowed. Tense cannot be marked on subordinate adverbial or coordinatedependent verbs, and Tense marking cannot co-occur on the same verb as aspect or
mood marking.
Because Present Tense and Future Tense marking are not obligatory even in
semantically appropriate and morphologically allowed contexts, there is no reason to
suggest that there is, in structuralist terms, a Past Tense marked by zero. Such an
analysis would force one to distinguish between unmarked Present or Future Tense
marking, and zero Past Tense marking; such a distinction would be difficult to sustain,
in theory and in practice.
12.2.1 THE FUTURE TENSEThe Future Tense is marked by verbal suffix -re. The Future Tense category marks an
event or state as being located in a time which is after now. In Chung and TimberlakeÕs
(1985) terms, it is an absolute tense marker, marking time with respect to the speech
event. Some examples:

ÔsheÕs asleepÕ. This is a stative verb, using the Agreement Suffix (see Section 10.5),
rather than a Present Tense-marked verb.
Note that the fact that the Present Tense suffix contains subject number marking has an
interesting result. In Lavukaleve, information about an argument of a verb can only be
cross-referenced once (if at all) per verb. So the fact that the number of the subject is
cross-referenced by the tense suffix means that information about the subject cannot be
marked elsewhere on a Present Tense-marked verb, for example by a prefix or by the
Agreement Suffix.
Morphological Present Tense marking is relatively rare. It is far more common in
Lavukaleve for present time reference to be marked phrasally than morphologically.
The usual way to do this is to use a clause chain involving one or more lexical verbs
plus the verb lei ÔexistÕ, particularly with non-punctual verbs (see Chapter 15 for a
discussion of clause chains). The next two (elicited) examples contrast a present-time
reference sentence and a past time reference sentence respectively.

mat he isÕ. Contrast this with the second sentence, in which past time reference is shown
by the particle marigen ÔyesterdayÕ, and the predicate is a simple verb.

co 19512.3 ASPECT
There are two aspectual categories marked morphologically in Lavukaleve. There is an
Imperfective Aspect, marked by suffix - ne, and a Durative Aspect, marked by the
suffixes -nun ~ -na.
Aspect marking is not obligatory, and it cannot co-occur with Tense, Mood or most
other verbal morphology. No Aspectual category can occur on negated verbs, or verbs
marked with any other suffix. Because Aspect-marked verbs cannot receive the
Agreement Suffix (see Chapter 10), they cannot occur in certain types of focus
constructions (see Chapter 11), or relative clauses (see Section 16.3). Aspect-marked
verbs can occur with object and, rarely, subject cross-referencing prefixes.","[326, 327, 328]"

Punctuation conventions are as follows. A numbered chunk of text is an intonation group
plus extra-prosodic afterthoughts which are syntactically and/or semantically linked. Fullstops indicate sentence-final intonation. Commas represent a pause after a rise in pitch.
Slashes represent a pause after level pitch. Exclamation marks indicate prosodically
prominent elements inserted into the intonation contour. Question marks indicate question
intonation. Double quotes indicate direct speech, which may be pronounced in a different
voice than the rest of the text.","[465, 466, 467]"

word class. It functions as the head of an NP, taking the definite article, but there are
two reasons for not calling it a noun. Firstly, it does not have its own gender, but takes
its gender from the noun whose identity it is questioning. Secondly, it can appear with a
noun immediately following it, in apposition to it, in the same NP, to mean Ôwhich X?Õ.
It is not possible for two nouns to be juxtaposed in this way; normally, two nouns within
an NP must bear a head-dependent relationship to each other, using the possessive
construction (see Section 4.2). For these reasons, although it clearly has a close
relationship with nouns, roi is considered a word of its own word class.
Roi~doi inflects according to its own paradigm, marking number and gender of the
referent which it is questioning.masc

verbal morphology. It could be thought of as a unique member of a subclass of verbs,
but because of its very different behaviour from verbs I prefer to put it in a class of its

The form and functions of the Habitual Auxiliary are discussed in Section 14.3.
3.9 POSTPOSITIONS
Postpositions are a small class of words. Their defining features are:

can occur with the Locative suffix. Postpositions and postpositional phrases are
discussed in Section 7.1. Note there is a conjunction ne ÔandÕ, formally identical to ne
ÔwithÕ (see Section 3.10).
3.10 CONJUNCTIONS
There are seven conjunctions in Lavukaleve: aka Ôand, so thenÕ; taman ÔhoweverÕ; leta
ÔbutÕ; o Ôand, orÕ; olang ÔbecauseÕ; ve ÔorÕ; ne ÔandÕ. The last can also function as a
postposition. Conjunctions share the following features:
573 - WORD C LASSES·
·they occur in between a pair of coordinated clauses or NPs
apart from aka, which can take the Presentative suffix -ri and Predicative -o/om/v,
they cannot take any morphological affixationThe use of conjunctions in conjoined clauses is mentioned in Section 15.4.6 and
discussed in Section 18.1.3. The Presentative and Predicative suffixes, and aka, are
discussed in Sections 8.9.4 and 8.10.3.
3.11 LOCATIONALS
Locationals are a loose, heterogeneous class of words that include the hoka ÔhereÕ
paradigm (including hoka ÔhereÕ; hoika Ôthere, medial; heaka Ôthere, distantÕ; hoaka
Ôthere; unspecified distanceÕ); ika ÔthereÕ, and koka~oka ÔfarÕ, all of which take
Presentative suffix -ri and Predicative -o/om/v, plus a number of other single
uninflecting words including uke ÔnearÕ; umu Ôunder, belowÕ; vuli ÔbehindÕ; fain Ôon
topÕ; fafaril ÔacrossÕ; sangine ÔtogetherÕ.
These words are grouped together not on morphological grounds; indeed they are
morphologically very varied. Rather they are grouped together on the semantic basis
that they provide locational specification to a clause. They function as adjuncts, having
scope over a whole clause. Some of these words can take the Presentative -ri,
Predicative -o/om/v and Extended -la. Their classification as locationals recognises the
fact that they form a semantic class. In strictly formal terms, different classes could be
recognised, based on whether or not they take either the Presentative -ri and Predicative
suffix -o/om/v (hoka, hoika, heaka, hoaka, aka, ika, koka and oka) and Extended -la
(the same group but without hoaka and aka). Those that do not would then be classified
as particles. However it seems descriptively more revealing to think about them in terms
of their semantic relationship to each other. In this way, members of the same semantic
set like uke ÔnearÕ (uninflecting) and koka~oka ÔfarÕ (taking Presentative -ri and
Predicative -o/om/v and Extended -la) do not have to be separated.
Those locationals which end in k a enter into certain formal and paradigmatic
relationships with each other, and with the demonstratives; these forms are discussed in
Sections 8.9 and 8.10, where there is also a discussion of the Presentative -ri and
Predicative -o/om/v and Extended -la.
3.12 NUN ÔFROMÕ
Nun ÔfromÕ is a locational particle which differs from the other locationals in that it
always occurs together with a nominal adjunct, immediately following it, and together
with this nominal adjunct it forms a complex locational adjunct. Nun is discussed in
Section 7.4.
583 - WORD C LASSES3.13 DEMONSTRATIVE IDENTIFIERS
There is a class of words which are formally related to the foia demonstrative pronoun,
with the addition of an extra syllable /hV/ after the first syllable of the pronoun, where
V takes its form from the vowel of the first syllable of the pronoun.
Demonstrative identifiers only occur in non-verbal clauses, functioning somewhat
similarly to predicative deictics. See Section 8.11 for a discussion of them, and a
comparison with predicative deictics.
3.14 ROI ~DOI ÔWHICH?Õ
There is a word roi~doi Ôwhich?Õ (the forms vary freely; see Section 2.10), a question
word, which forms its own word class, on the basis of its morpho-syntactic properties. It
functions as the head of an NP, so one might want to call it a noun, but there are two
reasons that this is not an appropriate classification. Firstly, it is a criterial feature of
nouns that they have their own inherent gender. Roi does not, but instead takes its
gender from the word whose status it is questioning. Secondly, it can appear in an NP in
apposition with, and before, this noun which it is questioning. Nouns do not do this; two
nouns in the same NP must normally appear in a head-modifier relationship, using the
possessive construction (see Section 4.2 for discussion of this). The fact that roi can
appear in apposition with a noun means that it is not a noun. The fact that it appears
before, not after, this noun, means that it could not possibly be modifying this noun;
modifiers invariably follow, not precede, their heads. For these reasons, roi is not
considered a noun or an adjective, but instead is considered to belong to its own word
class.
Other question words are discussed below, Section 3.17.2. Roi is discussed further,
along with other question words, in Section 17.1.4.
3.15 REFLEXIVE MUAN ÔSELF Õ
The reflexive word muan ÔselfÕ is in its own word class, as it has features unique to it. It
is obligatorily prefixed with a Possessive prefix, to indicate its referent. It may also be
preceded by an NP stating this referent. Verbal morphology cross-references the NP (or
the referent to which the Possessive prefix refers), not muan itself. Muan is not a noun,
as it has no gender, and does not function as the head of an NP, cannot be modified by a
demonstrative and cannot take the definite article, does not function as an argument, and
therefore it cannot be cross-referenced by a predicate. Muan is called a reflexive word,
because one of its functions is reflexive, but it also occurs to indicate that the actor did
the action alone, by themselves. In the following example, muan appears with a 1st
person singular Possessive prefix, and an NP consisting of the 1st person pronoun
593 - WORD C LASSESprecedes it. The verb cross-references the 1st singular subject:

3.16 VERB ADJUNCTS
There is a small closed class of verb adjuncts, consisting of only four words: fo'for Ôfly,
prepareÕ; ko'kor ÔtightÕ; so'sor ÔfastÕ and va'var ÔtalkingÕ.
Verb adjuncts only occur in construction with the verb hai ÔdoÕ; together the words
form a kind of complex predicate. They immediately precede hai. Nothing can
intervene between the verb adjunct and hai, and the verb adjunct cannot occur with any
other verb than hai.
It is easy to distinguish verb adjuncts from other word classes. They are not nominal
arguments, because they are never, under any circumstance, cross-referenced by the
verb. They are not verbs, because they never receive any verbal morphology; and in
addition, verbs are all vowel-final. They are different from particles, both in their fixed
position and in their reliance on the presence of hai ÔdoÕ. It is interesting to note the
formal relationship between the four verb adjuncts: they all end in /r/, and they look like
older reduplications; the non-initial stress pattern is also suggestive of this (see Section
2.7.1 for a discussion of the types of words which have non-initial stress). If they are old
reduplications, it is not at all clear what the unreduplicated words were, or what word
class they were. Interestingly, there is a noun va'var ÔtalkingÕ as well.
Note that borrowed verbs also function similarly to verb adjuncts, but in construction
with sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ rather than with hai. Verb adjunct constructions are
discussed in Section 14.4.
3.17 PARTICLES
There are a large number of particles in Lavukaleve; these words take no morphological
affixation, and do not occur in close construction with any other word or constituent.
They can be divided into smaller subclasses based on their scope across a constituent or
clause, and their semantics. Adverbial particles have scope over a clause or a single

3.17.1 A DVERBIAL PARTICLESThere are only ten adverbial particles in the corpus. Most verbal modification is done by
full verbal clauses rather than by adverbs. Adverbs are a subclass of particles which can
have scope over a single verb (although this is not always the case; they can also have
scope over an entire clause). They are all manner adverbs. As there are so few, it is
worth giving an exhaustive list, although there are probably more in the language than
occur in the corpus collected so far.

Focus constructions
11.1 INTRODUCTION
There are three focus markers in Lavukaleve, functioning in a grammaticalised focus
system, which is a very prominent part of the language. Syntactically the focus markers
are independent words which occur in construction with the constituent immediately to
their left. This is often an NP, but can also be an adjunct, a dependent clause, a predicate
and its object or an entire sentence.
There are two constructions in which the focus markers take part: a Sentence-Final focus
construction, in which the focus marker is in construction with a predicate plus its object
or a sentence, and appears at the end of the sentence; and a Sentence-Internal focus
construction, in which the focus marker is in construction with a non-predicating
constituent, and appears sentence-internally. The focus marker expresses focus on the
constituent with which it is in construction. So Sentence-Final focus markers express
focus on either a sentence or a predicate plus its object; and Sentence-Internal focus
markers express focus on an argument, an adjunct, a non-main verb, and the first part of
a complex predicate. Constructions involving focus markers are extremely common in
Lavukaleve; focus markers occur in approximately 35% of all sentences in the corpus.
This chapter describes the morphological and syntactic features of the focus markers, the
syntactic constructions which they occur in, and the pragmatic functions of these
constructions. Section 11.2 describes the forms and syntax of the focus markers
themselves. The major part of the chapter (Section 11.3) describes the constructions in
which the focus markers occur. Section 11.3.2 describes in detail Sentence-Final focus
constructions. Section 11.3.3 describes Sentence-Internal focus constructions. Section
11.5 discusses those situations in which there is more than one focus marker in one
24711 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSsentence. Section 11.6.1 describes those situations in which there is no marked focus.
Section 11.6.2 shows that the focus markers are not copulas, although they share certain
functions which copulas have in some languages. Section 11.6.4 notes the functional
similarity between Lavukaleve focus constructions and English accent prosody. While the
beginning of Section 11.2 gives a brief outline of the difference between each of the three
focus markers, Section 11.7 describes each of them in detail. Section 11.8 is a brief
summary of the main features of the focus system in Lavukaleve.
Throughout this chapter I use the term ÔconstructionÕ in the sense of the correspondence
between a morpho-syntactic structure and its pragmatic/semantic functions. So Ôfocus
constructionsÕ are those constructions which have a particular morpho-syntactic structure,
and express a particular pragmatic meaning.
11.2 MORPHOLOGY AND SYNTAX OF THE FOCUS MARKERS
The focus markers are independent words which form their own word class. The three
focus markers each form a paradigm of suppletive forms marked for person, gender and
number. The three different focus markers are meo, heo and feo (cited throughout in
their 3rd person singular feminine form). Each one is used for a different sentence type.
Meo is used in polar questions. Heo is used in certain syntactic environments such as
information questions, or where there is a demonstrative pronoun foia in the clause, or as
the second focus marker in a focus-echo construction. Heo can also be used to express
strong emphasis; this use of heo rather than feo or meo is not obligatory (unlike the
others), but a pragmatic choice made by a speaker for a certain effect. The third focus
marker, feo, is the unmarked one; it has the widest distribution and the least constraints
on its use. It is used in all situations where grammatical focus is to be expressed, apart
from those using heo or meo. In this sense, feo can be viewed as the default focus
marker.
11.2.1 PARADIGMS OF THE FOCUS MARKERSThese three paradigms are identical but for the initial consonant:

The first and second person forms of these paradigms show close formal similarity with
the free pronouns, consisting of C(o) plus the pronoun form. There is also a slightly less
strong formal relationship with the demonstratives. See Sections 8.4.1, 8.5 and 8.7.1 for
the paradigms. Note also that, as well as having a formal relationship with
demonstratives, the focus markers have a certain functional overlap with them in some
contexts; this is discussed in Section 11.4.2.
11.2.2 SYNTACTIC STATUSThe focus markers occur following and in construction with predicates plus their objects,
sentences, and non-predicating constituents. In the first example below, a focus marker is
in construction with the second NP of a non-verbal clause, in the second with a temporal
adjunct, in the third with a non-main verb (in this case a coordinate-dependent verb in a
clause chain) and in the fourth with an intransitive predicate. Throughout this chapter the
focussed constituents are italicised in the Lavukaleve; and in the English translation the
focussed element is in bold; the rest of this chapter justifies the claims implicit in this.

"372 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYMost utterances in Lavukaleve are vowel-final; verbs (the final element of most
sentences) are, and most verbal suffixing is; in particular, the kinds of things likely to be
yelled at a distance are. Names usually are, and Imperative verbs always are. Of those
things liable to be shouted which are not already vowel-final, the last consonant and
vowel is deleted before /ou/ is added. Thus the name Patterson, when shouted, becomes
[pate'sou].
2.10 ALTERNATIVE REALISATIONS
There are some examples of alternative pronunciations of certain words. These
alternative realisations all involve interchange between different phonemes of the
language. That is, the alternations neutralise the distinction between otherwise
independent phonemes. However, being lexically constrained, and also being optional,
it is never the case that ambiguity arises through the neutralisation of these phonemes in
the words in which it occurs. In each case, I have written the words in question with
their most common pronunciation. The words are:
/d/~ /r/ria
roi
raine['dia] ~ ['ria]
['doi] ~ ['roi]
['daine] ~ ['raine]Ôwhere to?Õ
Ôwhere?Õ
ÔtomorrowÕNote that the /d/ ~ /r/ alternation only occurs in the words initial position. The word
raine also occurs in the word iruraine ÔdailyÕ. In this case the pronunciation can only
be:
iruraine['iru'raine]ÔdailyÕ/b/ ~ /v/beko
vuli['beko] ~ [ºeko]
['buli] ~ ['ºuli]ÔstoneÕ
ÔbehindÕ/n/ ~ /l/mulukuita
halangas['munu'kuita] ~ ['mulu'kuita]
['hana'÷as] ~ ['hala'÷as]ÔmosquitoÕ
ÔcoralÕThese alternations are all a generationally-based phenomenon. Younger people, in their
twenties or younger, tend to pronounce /d/, /b/ and /n/ in certain words where older
people consistently pronounce /r/, /v/ and /l/ respectively. This is not a universal
generational sound change, but rather is lexically constrained.
2.11 WORDS
So far, and indeed throughout the rest of this work, the concept and extent of words is
assumed. In Lavukaleve, the definition of words is a relatively simple matter.
382 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYWords can be defined on phonological grounds. One can pause between, but not within,
a word; this is AndersonÕs (1985: 151) idea of Òpotential pause locationsÓ. On another
level, words have psychological reality; speakers can pronounce them in isolation and
talk about them. Units smaller than a word, however, cannot be easily pronounced or
talked about in isolation. Grammatical words are made up of stems plus, in some cases,
affixes. Phonological words are in almost all cases coextensive with grammatical
words; there are is only one case in which a phonological word is different from a
grammatical word. This is verb compounds. In verb compounds (see Section 14.2) one
grammatical word is made up of two phonological words, each with its own stress. In
all other cases, phonological words are the same as grammatical words.
2.12 ORTHOGRAPHY
An orthography has been in use for a number of years by the Lavukal community. I
follow this established orthography, with a couple of differences. The only respects in
which the orthography used here differs substantially from the IPA conventions are as
follows:
PHONEMEIS WRITTEN/º/
/¼/
/÷/v
g
ngThere is some debate within the Lavukal community about how best to represent the
phoneme /÷/ in the orthography. The symbol nÛÛ was used for some time, in keeping with
the orthographies of other languages of the region. However problems with typesetting
mean that usually the bar is left off, and thus phonemes /n/ and /÷/ are in practice not
distinguished in the orthography. By recent consensus, it has been decided that the
digraph /ng/ should be used instead of nÛÛ.
Stress is not marked in the Lavukal orthography, but in this work I do indicate lexical
stress, by a straight quote before the stressed syllable: vo'vou, only on those stems in
which stress is not on the initial syllable.
Same-vowel sequences are also not represented in the LavukalsÕ orthography, but I do
represent them here in the following circumstances. I always write identical vowel
sequences when they are a part of a mono-morphemic word: see Ôbe fullÕ. However,
when two morphemes come together and create an identical-vowel sequence, a
morphophonemic rule comes into play to reduce the sequence (see Section 2.9), and
these are not represented in the surface forms of words.
Throughout this thesis, four-line example sentences are used. The first line consists of
surface forms; the second line consists of underlying forms; the third line is a
392 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYmorphemic gloss, and the fourth line is a free translation. In many cases, the first and
second lines are identical, but it is useful to have the two separate lines precisely for
those circumstances in which identical-vowel sequences are reduced; and for the few
other morphophonemic processes in the language. At the end of the fourth, free
translation line, comes an abbreviated symbol showing where the fragment comes from.
Appendix 2 contains the list of abbreviations with full details on the source of the data,
showing whether the material was elicited or came from spontaneous texts, and if the
latter, showing the name of the text and the name and village of the speaker.","[63, 64, 65, 66]"
"CONVENTIONS IN EXAMPLE SENTENCES
In Lavukaleve examples:
comma - non-final rise in pitch
fullstop - sentence-final drop in pitch
exclamation mark - prosodically prominent element inserted into intonation
contour
question mark - question intonation
quote marks - direct speech
slash - pause with even pitch (only used where it is relevant to the point under
discussion)
In glosses, the gender of a noun is given in brackets after the noun e.g. fish(m).
In glosses, only those verb prefix forms which distinguish between Subject, Object
and/or Possessive are glossed as such. All 2nd person forms, and 1st person dual and
plural, which do not distinguish these grammatical roles, are unmarked for these roles in
glosses, even when their syntactic role is clear.
In translations, square brackets indicate explanatory material not actually present in the
text. The letter/number codes at the ends of the translations refer to the exact place in the
text from which the example was taken. The initial group of letters and numbers indicates
the exact text the data was taken from (it is usually an abbreviation of the speaker's name)
and the second group of numbers refers to the sequential position of the sentence in the
text. The list of abbreviations with the speaker's name and village appears in Appendix 2.xxiiixxivMap 1: The Solomon Islands in the south-west PacificMap 2: The Solomon IslandsxxvI promise nothing complete;

Introduction
1.1 LAVUKALEN AND LAVUKALS
Lavukaleve, a Papuan language, is the language of the Russell Islands, which is a group
of islands in the Central Province of the Solomon Islands. The Russells consist of one
large island Pavuvu (Ôthe mainlandÕ, in local terms), which is about 34 kilometres at its
widest part and 26 kilometres at its longest, and another largish island, Banika (about 14
kilometres at its widest, and 22 kilometres at its longest), with a hundred or so smaller
islands clustered around them. Legend has it that there used to be 100 islands in the
Russells, but during a cyclone one sank, leaving the 99 there supposedly are today.
There are perhaps 2000 Lavukal people, by my own estimate, who live in these islands,
in eleven or so main villages and a small number of hamlets.
There are many non-Lavukal people also living in the Russells. These include the
Tikopians, a Polynesian group who were resettled by the British colonial government in
the 1950s from their own island of Tikopia. They now live largely in two villages on
Pavuvu: Nukufero and Samata. There are also many non-Lavukal people living in
Yandina, the provincial capital. Mostly these people are from Malaita and Guadalcanal,
who have come to Yandina for work. There are also non-Lavukal people living in the
south of the Russells at Linggatu, working for a logging company which operates on
Pavuvu. There are also a couple of villages of non-Lavukal people working for Russell
Islands Plantation Estates Limited (RIPEL), a company that owns coconut and cocoa
plantations and a small amount of cattle, mostly on Pavuvu. Apart from these areas, the
only other non-Lavukal people in the Russells are those few who have married Lavukals
and live in Lavukal villages.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"These question words still take masculine agreement even when their referent is known
to be feminine. Consider for example the following sentence, in which man ÔwhatÕ,
with a masculine demonstrative, is used to refer to ruia Ôold womanÕ, a feminine noun.
In this story, an old woman is born from a magical rotten coconut, to the surprise of the
boy, who is the speaker in the second sentence:1My examples may seem somewhat unnatural; but compare them with Giv—nÕs (1972: 82) example of
gender resolution in Chibemba: ""The book, the bed and the peanut are here"" (quoted in Corbett 1991:
275).",[161]
"2.8 INTONATION
I have not done an intonational study of Lavukaleve, but it is worth noting a few points.
There are two main intonational patterns in Lavukaleve discourse. A very noticeable
drop in pitch occurs at the end of intonation patterns which are coextensive with
syntactic structures which one would wish to call declarative sentences. Thus, in
shorthand, a declarative sentence is characterised intonationally by a final drop in pitch.
There is also a high rising pitch which occurs at the end of certain clause types; this
pitch involves a steady intonation across the clause, culminating in a sharp rise on the
last syllable of the clause. This kind of intonation pattern occurs on non-final clauses in
clause chaining constructions, and in subordinate clauses which precede a main clause.
They are always completed - syntactically and intonationally - by a main clause, which
has the drop in pitch described above. Note that the few subordinate clause types that
can follow their main clause, e.g. purposive clauses, are always pronounced with their
own sentence-intonation when they do so, as are the main clauses with which they are
in construction. (See Chapters 15 and 16 for a syntactic description of these
construction types).
Questions, as in many languages, are also expressed with a rising intonation.
2.9 MORPHOPHONEMIC PROCESSES
There are three kinds of morphophonemic processes: those that add material; those that
remove material completely, and those that merely change the quality of phonemic
material. In Lavukaleve, there is reduplication; there is a process of glottal stop insertion
between vowels at morpheme boundaries; there are processes of vowel deletion; and
there is a process involving change of vowel quality. Reduplication is relatively
frequent, glottal stop insertion is rare. The other morphophonemic processes are
obligatory, and ubiquitous.
2.9.1 REDUPLICATIONReduplication is a relatively productive process in Lavukaleve. It can apply to words of
many word classes, there is a range of actual forms of reduplication which can apply,
and different forms of reduplication can apply to the same word apparently freely.
2One might expect that identical vowel sequences distinguished only by stress, /'aa/ vs. /a'a/ would occur.
As it happens, there are no examples of such sequences as /a'a/ in the data. It is not clear whether this is
an accidental or motivated gap.",[58]
"543 - WORD C LASSESFoia and oia are both used to make anaphoric reference to a participant in a discourse.
They differ in that foia is used to make anaphoric reference to an activated referent, one
which is uppermost in hearersÕ minds, whereas oia is used to make anaphoric reference
to a semi-activated referent, one which was uppermost in hearersÕ minds until recently.
They are not considered personal pronouns, largely because they make obligatory
reference to distance from the speaker, which is characteristic of demonstrative
pronouns, rather than personal pronouns. A full discussion of these demonstrative
pronouns, including justification of their classification, and explanation of the
difference between them, as well as discussion of the difference between them and the
demonstrative modifier, appears in Chapter 8, where the paradigms of each are
presented.
3.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS
There are first and second person pronouns in Lavukaleve, but no third person pronoun.
The functional domain of third person pronouns is filled by demonstrative pronouns
instead. Argumentation for this division of the deictic paradigms is presented in full in
Chapter 8, where also the paradigm of 1st and 2nd person pronouns is given.
Defining features of personal pronouns are:
·
·
·
·they mark person and number of the referent, and inclusion/exclusion of the
addressee (only in 1st person non-singular forms)
they function as nominal heads
they cannot be modified by adjectives, though they can be modified by the
demonstrative modifier
they take the Group suffixes -ha/-saIt is perhaps worth noting here that there are no indefinite pronouns in Lavukaleve.
Concepts like someone/anyone are expressed using the noun ali ÔmanÕ; no-one is
expressed by the NP malav rovo-ru Ôpeople one.pl-NEG (no people)Õ or ali roa-ru
Ôman one.sgm-NEG (no man)Õ. Concepts like something/anything are expressed by the
noun mina ÔthingÕ; nothing by mina ro-ru Ôthing one.sgf-NEG (not a thing)Õ. Man
ÔwhatÕ, ami ÔwhoÕ, and elahave Ôhow muchÕ, all masculine nouns, can also mean
ÔwhateverÕ, ÔwhoeverÕ and Ôhowever muchÕ respectively. Plural noun elav Ôhow manyÕ
can also mean Ôhowever manyÕ. Roi~doi ÔwhichÕ can also mean ÔwhicheverÕ. Concepts
like somewhere/anywhere/nowhere, somehow/anyhow and so on are expressed as Ôin a
placeÕ, Ôin no placeÕ, Ôin a wayÕ and so on in Lavukaleve. There are no special
expressions for these concepts.
3.6 THE DEFINITE ARTICLE
The definite article consists of a paradigm of inflecting forms which appear with a noun
553 - WORD C LASSESin an NP to mark definiteness. It has the following morphological and syntactic
features:
·
·
·
·it can only occur with a head noun
it is obligatorily inflected for gender and number to agree with its head, and it can
take no further morphological affixation
only one article can occur per NP
when it occurs it is always the final word of the NPThe paradigm for the definite article is given in Section 4.1.2, where there is a
discussion of its morphological, syntactic and pragmatic features.
3.7 THE FOCUS MARKERS
There are three paradigms of focus markers, which are marked for person, gender and
number of a particular element of the constituent with which they are in construction5.
The three stems themselves have different pragmatic meanings as follows: the meo
focus marker is used in polar questions; the heo focus marker is used in information
questions, in clauses containing the demonstrative pronoun foia, and to mark strong
emphasis; and the feo focus marker is used elsewhere, in other contexts in which focus
is marked (the focus markers are cited in their 3rd person singular feminine forms here).
The focus markers have the following features:
·
·
·
·they each form a paradigm marked for person, gender and number and they can take
no further morphological affixation
they do not function as the head of a clause; that is, they have no arguments of their
own
they can occur in construction with NPs, adjuncts, verbs or entire sentences
they are always constituent-finalThe syntactic, morphological and pragmatic functions of the focus markers are
discussed in Chapter 11. The paradigms are given in that chapter.
3.8 THE HABITUAL AUXILIARY
The Habitual Auxiliary is a stem me. It is defined as its own word class on the
following grounds:
·
·5it forms the second part of a complex predicate, in construction with a verb
it cross-references the subject of the predicate of which it forms a part, using eitherWhat the focus marker agrees with is a matter of some complexity, which is dealt with in Chapter 11.","[80, 81, 82]"

wants to say that things continued on in the same manner for some time before a new
event occurred. The normal way to say this is to use the verb me ÔcontinueÕ, in a
subordinate clause using the Anterior suffix -ge, the subject of which is specified only
by a 3rd singular neuter prefix. Because it is a verb of a subordinate adverbial clause,
the third person intransitive subject is expressed using an object prefix (see Section 16.1
for an explanation of this). What is of concern here is only that there is no true subject;
but filling the subject position on such verbs is a 3sg prefix, of neuter gender. An
example:

-CAUS
w1 016-017A third situation in which default agreement can be seen is with the non-pronominal use
of a demonstrative, which is used more or less as a sequencing device between clauses,
much like the colloquial English ÔokayÕ. See Section 8.4.3 for a discussion of this. The
important point here is that although a demonstrative is used, it does not have a nominal
antecedent in this function; and the form used for this function is the singular neuter
medial demonstrative pronoun. This, then, is another instance of neuter gender being
used when there is no controller gender. An example of this usage:

jn2 022-024RESOLUTIONThe second problem with enforced agreement systems comes about when a speaker is
unable to specify agreement. This situation could come about for two reasons. Firstly,
the speaker may not know the gender of a referent. Secondly, the language may not
allow the correct agreement required. This latter situation could happen if there are two
participants of different genders. (If there are more than two participants, plural
agreement is used, which does not distinguish gender. However with two participants,
dual gender/number agreement is used, and gender must be distinguished.) If there are
two participants of the same gender, there is no problem. If there are two participants of
1346 - GENDER AND AGREEMENTdifferent genders, and at least one of the participants is masculine, then masculine
agreement is used. Thus:

feminine or neuter dual agreement (or masculine), but instead must use plural
agreement. As gender distinctions do not occur in the plural number, this strategy neatly
sidesteps the problem. (This and the previous example are elicited. Perhaps not
unsurprisingly, this kind of example is rare in natural discourse.1):

conflicts; resolution is achieved using syntactic principles.
If a speaker does not know the gender of a referent, they can either avoid agreement, or,
they can use question words like man ÔwhatÕ; ami ÔwhoÕ and elahave Ôhow muchÕ, in
which case gender is syntactically assigned, because these question words are masculine
nouns. Thus:

PP or other adjunct. These are Sentence-Internal focus constructions in which the

adjuncts to the main clause.

"1135 - NOUN FORMATION
5.6.3 DISCUSSION OF DUAL AND PLURAL FORMATIONSThe descriptions above of dual and plural formation strategies have raised a number of
issues. This section attempts to make some generalisations about dual and plural
formation. It also points to some caveats about the extent to which these phenomena can
be analysed as rule-governed and the extent to which they must be seen as
unpredictable. This is particularly the case with respect to the phenomenon of the
masculine singular and feminine singular suffixes, which has been mentioned above,
but which needs further discussion. Also of particular interest are how borrowed words
behave under dual and plural formations; the phenomenon of multiple dual/plural
formation strategies for the same noun; homonyms; and the question of nouns which are
always plural, and have no singular or dual forms.
THE MASCULINE AND FEMININE SINGULAR SUFFIXESOne issue which arises from the preceding data is that of singular marking. It is possible
to analyse the final /a/ in some feminine nouns, and the final /m/ in some masculine
nouns, as gendered singular markers: /a/ for feminine singular and /m/ for masculine
singular. This analysis has neat correlations with other gender/number agreement
marking in Lavukaleve. That is, -a is the feminine singular Agreement Suffix used in
verbs and adjectives; and -m is the corresponding masculine singular form. Also, this
analysis accounts for the loss of /a/ before some dual and plural suffixes (e.g. ruia Ôold
womanÕ (f) ruivil Ôold women (pl)Õ), and similarly the loss of /m/ before some dual and
plural suffixes (e.g. sulum ÔchiefÕ (m), suluverav Ôchiefs (pl)Õ. It certainly seems that it
is an accurate historical analysis. However, it is not the case that all final -m segments
occur on masculine singular nouns, or all final -a segments occur on masculine singular
nouns. Thus the analysis only has limited application. The reasons are as follows.
Firstly, with respect to /a/ as a feminine singular marker, while many feminine nouns do
end in /a/, many do not, and further, many non-feminine nouns end in /a/. Similarly,
while many masculine nouns end in /m/, not all do; and a few non-masculine nouns do
end in /m/: for example: e.g. iunifom ÔuniformÕ (f); aram ÔsandÕ (n); kastom Ôcustom,
cultureÕ (n). This means that the suffixes are not general throughout the language. Two
of these three words are loans, it is true, but some of the above examples (see also
below) have shown that loan words are very deeply incorporated into the plural
formation system, and generally act for these purposes in the same way as indigenous
words.
Secondly, with respect to the loss of -a on feminine nouns, and -m on masculine nouns,
it is not the case that this always happens before dual or plural suffixation. Firstly, it is
not just feminine nouns which lose a final /a/ before a number suffix; in fact, neuter
nouns can too. For example the plural form of mola ÔcanoeÕ (n) is molev. Similarly the
plural of kera ÔpaddleÕ (n) is kerev. Secondly, not all m-final masculine nouns lose this
/m/ before a plural suffix: tamtam ÔreefÕ (m), tamtamaul (pl); ko'rom Ôblack
1145 - NOUN FORMATIONsurgeonfish (m)Õ ko'romaul (pl); kovekukuam Ôpuddle on groundÕ (m),
kovekukuamaul (pl).
Thus, a final /m/ or /a/ usually, but not always, corresponds with a masculine or
feminine noun respectively. Presumably these segments are remnants of a previously
productive nominal gender-marking system. But for a synchronic analysis of
Lavukaleve, it is not useful to see stem-final /a/ and /m/ as anything other than
unanalysable parts of their noun stems.
The loss of final vowels, including /a/ and all other vowels, in dual and/or plural
formation is in no way related to the process described in Section 5.5 of loss of final
vowels in Possessed nouns. The group of nouns that lose their final vowels under
Possessed noun formation bear no particular relationship with the nouns that lose their
final vowel under dual and/or plural formation. The two are completely separate
morphological processes.
B ORROWED WORDS AND DUAL AND PLURAL FORMATIONObvious recent loan words behave exactly as words which are presumably indigenous
with respect to their dual and plural formations. That is, duals of borrowed words are
formed according to the same phonological criteria as duals of indigenous words.
Borrowed words are assigned to one of the ten plural declensions as far as can be seen
on the same basis as indigenous words; they are certainly apparent in most of the ten
declensions, and not obviously more represented in one declension than another. There
are no examples of borrowed words in some of the smaller declensions; probably
simply because there are few indigenous words in them anyway. It is certainly not the
case that all borrowed words are confined to one or two declensions. And within each
declension, borrowed words behave exactly as indigenous words do, operating under
the same phonological considerations as indigenous words. Some examples of dual and
plural formations of words known to be loans:1155 - NOUN FORMATIONSG FORM

is that it is not uncommon for one noun to have different dual or plural forms. Often one
speaker will use one dual or plural form, and another speaker will use a different one. In
some cases the same speaker will use different dual or plural forms on different
occasions.
With respect to dual marking, in every case where there is an alternative dual marking
strategy, one of the alternatives is no marking at all. In other words, for many nouns,
dual marking is optional. Some examples:

"111 - I NTRODUCTIONlarge number of minor classes, including adjectives, demonstratives, pronouns, focus
markers, postpositions, conjunctions, the Habitual Auxiliary, locationals, demonstrative
identifiers and verb adjuncts. There is a definite article, unlike in almost all Papuan
languages. It is marked for gender and number, and is the final member of a noun
phrase. Many of the Oceanic languages of the Solomon Islands have definite articles,
but they precede, rather than follow, their noun.
Nouns are divided into three genders. This is a feature common in languages of the East
Papuan Phylum, and rare in Oceanic languages. Gender in Lavukaleve is marked in
agreement forms on all noun modifiers, and on verbs through participant marking
prefixes and suffixes. Gender distinctions are maintained in singular and dual forms
throughout all areas of the language, but are collapsed in the plural. Nouns are overtly
marked for number, and the methods of marking number are highly complex and
irregular. There are up to 80 different ways of creating dual and plural forms of nouns.
Plural formation depends largely on phonological and semantic criteria, and also bears
some relationship to gender. Dual formation operates on different principles, largely
depending on the phonological shape of the singular noun. There is case marking for
three spatial/relational cases, but these have a low functional load. Possession is marked
by a prefix on the possessed noun. Types of possession are undifferentiated, as in most
Papuan languages, as opposed to Oceanic languages, in which possession is frequently a
very complex area. In Oceanic languages, possessive affixes are frequently the same as
object affixes; in Lavukaleve, all but one are identical to subject affixes. Like in most
Papuan languages, but unlike in Oceanic languages, all modifiers follow their head
noun.
Deictics are a highly elaborated feature of Lavukaleve. There are personal pronouns for
1st and 2nd persons, but not for 3rd person. The functional domain of personal
pronouns in the 3rd person is filled instead by a demonstrative modifier, and two
demonstrative pronouns, all three of which are marked for gender, number and three
degrees of distance from the speaker, with a further distinction made in the distal
category between specific and non-specific location. The two demonstrative pronouns
differ solely in terms of their discourse pragmatics. One is used for a referent which is
uppermost in the minds of speaker and addressee. The other is used for a referent who
was referred to previously but who is not the last referent to have been mentioned. This
demonstrative is used to switch attention between more than one referent in a discourse.
The demonstrative modifier and this demonstrative pronoun, along with various other
spatial deictics, have derived presentative forms, and also derived predicative forms.
There is also a set of demonstrative identifiers which occur in a similar functional
domain to the deictic predicates.
Verbs are the most morphologically complex of Lavukaleve words. Person, gender,
number and syntactic role (subject and object) are marked by two prefix slots, and
suffixes mark tense, aspect, mood and derivational categories such as causative,
reciprocal, locativisation, nominalisation, intransitivisation, and intensity. There are also
121 - I NTRODUCTIONthree categories of subordination, as well as other categories including negation and
extendedness, which can be marked by verbal suffixes. Verbs can also take a suffix to
mark the gender and number of one participant. This gender/number marking is used to
mark the subject of stative/resultative intransitive verbs (as opposed to active
intransitive verbs which use a verbal subject prefix to cross-reference their subject), and
occurs also on the verbs of relative clauses and focus constructions.
Complex predicates are extremely common, and consist of verb-plus-auxiliary
structures, serial verb constructions, and, to a much lesser extent, verb-adjunct
combinations. Serial verb constructions are common in both Papuan and Oceanic
languages, and adjunct constructions are well known in Papuan languages. Lavukaleve
however does not make extensive use of either, preferring separate clauses for
combining predicates and other expressions in general for common collocations.
Like many Papuan languages, one of the methods Lavukaleve uses to combine
predicates is clause chaining. There are three verbal suffixes used in clause chains,
which indicate the temporal relationship of the chained clause to the following clause.
However, unusually for a language which has clause chaining, there is no switchreference marking, and indeed there are no restrictions on argument sharing between
chained clauses. Subordination is also a very frequent method of clause combining, and
there are a few different semantic types of subordinate clauses. While in almost all areas
of its morpho-syntax Lavukaleve is a nominative/accusative language, adverbial
subordinate clauses involve a split-ergative marking system in which first and second
person subjects follow a nominative/accusative participant marking system whereas
third person subjects follow an ergative/absolutive marking system. Relative clauses are
internally-headed; their heads are syntactically part of the relative clause, not the main
clause.
Constituent order in Lavukaleve is fixed: SV/AOV. Departures from this norm are rare;
an argument which is an afterthought can be postposed. Preposing and postposing for
emphasis do not occur in Lavukaleve; these pragmatic functions are carried out instead
by focus constructions.
Focus is a central part of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax. It is heavily grammaticalised into
clause structure, and extremely frequent in discourse. Roughly one third of all clauses
have some kind of grammatical focus construction. Any constituent can be focussed,
including NPs, postpositional phrases and other nominal adjuncts, adverbs, predicates
(either just a verb, or a verb with its object), subordinate clauses, the lexical part of a
complex predicate, or indeed whole sentences. There are two different kinds of
syntactic focus construction, one with the verb in a special form, used to mark focus on
predicates (verb plus object) or whole sentences, and one without this special verb form,
used for focussing on arguments, adjuncts and non-main verbal forms. In both
construction types, focus is marked by special particles, which occur immediately after
the focussed constituent and show agreement in person, gender and number. The scope
131 - I NTRODUCTIONof the focus is indicated by the agreement of the focus marker. There are three separate
paradigms of focus markers, which differ in terms of the sentence type with which they
occur. One is used only in polar questions; one in content questions and environments
expressing particular kinds of emphasis; the third is used elsewhere.
There is a deep relationship between deictics and focus markers involving, among other
things, a system of alliterative discord, a type of agreement system in which the form of
a deictic in a focus construction requires the form of the focus marker to disagree with it
in its initial consonant.
Focus marking and deictics are the most highly elaborated areas of Lavukaleve morphosyntax, and indeed the largest chapters of this description are devoted to these. In these
areas Lavukaleve finds grammatical expression of discourse-pragmatic domains of
focus, emphasis and activation. Indeed, as is clear from the description to follow, it is
not possible to explicate the basic morpho-syntax of Lavukaleve without making
constant reference to these pragmatic domains.","[37, 38, 39, 40]"

always, contrastive. Example (48) is contrastive; it was the fourth canoe, as opposed to
the third, which was mentioned last. However, there are many non-contrastive examples

contrast.

possibilities of other NPs. They can be modified, they can contain the definite article,
they can consist of personal pronouns or demonstrative modifiers, and they can be in
any syntactic function within the clause. They cannot, however, consist of
demonstrative pronouns, either from the foia or the oia paradigms. These examples
contain, respectively, a modified indefinite NP in S function; a definite NP in S
function; an NP in O function; an NP which is a demonstrative modifier; an NP which
is a personal pronoun, and an NP which is the subject of a non-verbal clause.

constructions involved in narrow focus; that is, so-called argument focus. The table
summarises the information to be explained in the rest of the chapter.","[280, 281]"
"In Lavukaleve, the situation is similar to this. One could think of the deictic as the head,
29111 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSthe form of which determines the agreement of the focus marker. An f-stem deictic head
(pronoun foia) requires an h-stem focus marker (heo). An h-stem deictic head (hoia)
allows an f-stem focus marker (feo). This is alliterative discord in the sense that the
agreement markers, f and h, occur on both of the word classes concerned; as markers of
agreement. Concord implies identity; these markers however, agree, as it were, by
disagreeing. This, then, is alliterative discord.
There is also an interaction between f and h within the focus markers; recall that if there
are two focus markers in construction with each other (i.e. in focus-echo constructions),
the first may be either feo or heo, but the second must be heo, not feo. The interaction
between f/h stems in focus markers is somewhat different from the f/h interaction between
deictics and focus markers. With focus markers, the interaction between f- and h-stems is
due to a cumulative effect of a combination between emphasis and focus, and arises as a
corollary of the respective functions of the f-stem and h-stem focus markers.
THE FEO FOCUS MARKERFeo is the ÒelsewhereÓ focus marker; that is, it is used in all contexts where a focus
marker is needed but the conditions are not appropriate for meo or heo. It is used in
statements, not in questions, and in clauses in which there is no foia demonstrative
pronoun, and where there is no strong emphasis. Examples have occurred frequently
throughout this chapter, and more need not be repeated here.
11.8 SUMMARY
There are three focus markers in Lavukaleve, which are used in different constructions.
The constituent with which the focus marker is in construction is the focussed constituent.
Many different types of constituents can be focussed: a predicate plus its object, a
sentence, an NP or an adjunct, including nominal adjuncts, adverbs, particles, non-main
verbs and the first part of complex predicates.
When predicates and sentences are focussed, the focus marker is the final element of the
sentence; thus, these constructions are called Sentence-Final focus constructions. The
agreement of the focus marker determines the domain of focus, thus sentence focus and
predicate focus are distinguished by the agreement shown on the focus marker.
When arguments are focussed, the focus marker appears immediately after the argument,
sentence-internally; thus the constructions are called Sentence-Internal focus
constructions.
As a point of embarkation, LambrechtÕs definition of focus was used; he regards focus as
a scope indicator, related to phenomena of assertion and presupposition. LavukaleveÕs
use of focus differs in some respects from many other languages, for example in its
29211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSfrequent focus-marking of dependent clauses, but it was pointed out that since Lavukaleve
so clearly marks what is and what is not focussed, it is no difficult matter to determine
what is focussed in Lavukaleve; and thus an understanding of the pragmatics of focus
marking in Lavukaleve can be arrived at empirically.
It was also shown how LavukaleveÕs focus marking system grammaticalises LambrechtÕs
three-way division of focus into sentence, predicate and argument focus in an extremely
clear way; in fact, Lavukaleve is a better exemplar of his three-way division than English
or the other languages he uses.
Some aspects of LavukaleveÕs focus marking system are highly unusual. For instance it is
unusual for a focus marker to show agreement, and to be so heavily grammaticalised as
LavukaleveÕs obviously is. Further, it is impossible to describe the basic morpho-syntax
of Lavukaleve without having recourse to information structure. This is not uncommon in
languages; what is uncommon is the extent to which the categories of information
structure pervade LavukaleveÕs grammar.","[317, 318, 319]"

function. Foia demonstratives in postpositional phrases are uncommon, but there are
examples of these in Sentence-Final focus constructions in the corpus (Section 11.4.1
explains that Sentence-Final focus constructions expressing focus on postpositional
phrases are very rare). The following example shows a foia demonstrative pronoun in a
postpositional phrase, in a clause with a Sentence-Final focus construction. The focus
marker is from the heo, not feo paradigm:

on an NP, this NP cannot consist of a demonstrative pronoun from the foia paradigm.
So the question whether a foia demonstrative pronoun in argument focus would occur
with a feo or heo copula does not arise.
Unlike the demonstrative pronoun foia, personal pronouns do not affect the form of the
focus marker; see for example (37) and (38) above. Neither do demonstrative pronouns
from the oia paradigm:

If the focus marker is marking a Sentence-Internal focus construction, the presence of a
foia demonstrative pronoun does not affect the form of the focus marker. In the
following example, the focus marker, which is in an argument focus construction
focussing on the first part of the complex predicate ovu lome is unaffected by the

meo focus marker. This phenomenon only affects the feo and heo focus markers.
This phenomenon is one that deserves some attention. Deictics and focus markers can cooccur; however the way in which they can co-occur is tightly constrained. That is, h-stem
deictics (in other words, demonstrative modifiers from the hoia paradigm) and f-stem
focus markers (from the feo paradigm) can co-occur, and f-stem deictics (demonstrative
pronouns from the foia paradigm) and h-stem focus markers (from the heo paradigm)
can co-occur, but an f-stem deictic (foia) canÕt co-occur with an f-stem focus marker
(feo). If a focus clause contains a foia pronoun, the feo focus marker cannot be used;
instead heo must be used.
This phenomenon is an obligatory syntactic phenomenon, not a stylistic or pragmatic
choice which speakers can make. Because it is automatic on the choice of a focus
construction which contains a demonstrative pronoun, it is not a pragmatic variable that
speakers can manipulate. For this reason, it is best seen as a kind of agreement
phenomenon; one could think of it as alliterative discord. Alliterative concord is a type of
agreement system whereby the head, on which agreement depends, contains material
which is identical to the material showing agreement on other word classes. Corbett
(1991: 117) says, with reference to Swahili gender agreement:
1. the noun itself includes a form which is identical to the gender agreement marker and
which clearly indicates the gender of the nouns;
2. the same gender agreement marker is used for different agreement targets.","[315, 316, 317]"

jh 023This type of referentiality bears a superficial resemblance to what Himmelmann (1996)
describes as the recognitional function of demonstratives: ÒRecognitional use of
demonstratives ... draws on specific, ÔpersonalizedÕ knowledge that is assumed to be
shared by the communicating parties due to a common interactional history or to
supposedly shared experiencesÓ (p. 233). However mea differs from recognitional
demonstratives in a few ways. Firstly, recognitional demonstratives, as Himmelmann
describes them, are used primarily by the speaker to make sure the hearer knows which
referent the speaker means, by calling on shared knowledge between the speech act
participants:
A central feature of this use is that the speaker anticipates problems with respect to the
information used in referring to a given referent. That is, the speaker is uncertain
whether or not the kind of information he or she is giving is shared by the hearer or774 - NPS AND P OSSESSION
whether or not this information will be sufficient in allowing the hearer to identify the
intended referent. Such use could always be (and in fact often is) accompanied by a you
know? or remember?-type of tag question. (p. 230)This is not the case with mea; rather than being an overt manifestation of a speakerÕs
uncertainty over whether or not their intended referent will be understood, mea is, it
seems, rather an acknowledgment of the fact that the speaker and the hearer share their
knowledge and experience of the world. Further, although mea has these referential
functions which resemble demonstratives in certain ways, mea is not a demonstrative.
According to two of HimmelmannÕs (1996) criteria for what constitutes a
demonstrative, mea does not contain reference to distance in its semantics, which
demonstratives do, and it is frequently used for first mentions of unique entities, which
demonstratives cannot be; this can be seen in examples (28) and (29) below for
instance. In addition, mea can co-occur with the definite article, which demonstratives
cannot, and it can co-occur with demonstratives, which suggests that it occurs in a
different slot from demonstratives. Finally, mea can never appear without a head, unlike
demonstratives. For these reasons, mea is not considered a demonstrative, although it is
certainly true that its functions do bear some resemblance to some of the functions
commonly seen in demonstratives.
Mea is usually translated here using ÔthisÕ or ÔthatÕ, but the reader should understand
these in the sense of Ôthis thing that we all know about (because we share a common
culture and know the same things)Õ.
Because it makes overt reference to shared knowledge, mea often occurs with proper
nouns, in particular, places and people familiar to all Lavukal people. Such usages
cannot be felicitously translated into English.

There are four suffixes applicable to deictics. Three of these, the Group, Presentative
and Predicative suffixes can only apply to deictics. Each suffix applies to just a subset
of all deictics. The morphology is set out here, together with an indication of which
deictics it can occur with. The rest of this section describes each suffix in more detail:

first and second person pronouns, as well as on foia/hoia/oia stems, to indicate that the
referents of the word are viewed by the speaker as a unified group. They are only used
with reference to humans. The -ha suffix marks a group consisting only of feminine
1858 - D EICTICSreferents, and the -sa suffix marks a group irrespective of the gender of its members:
that is, a group marked by -sa can consist either of only masculine referents, or of
masculine and feminine referents, or of only feminine referents. The feminine Group
suffix -ha is much less common then the non-gendered suffix -sa. The suffixes are
optional, and indeed occur only rarely. The Group suffix -sa has also been found on the
particle bae~bai ÔletÕs goÕ. Some examples of the Group suffixes:

Ôhere/there/there, farÕ (but not hoaka Ôthere, far unspecifiedÕ); koka~oka ÔfarÕ; ika
ÔthereÕ and the demonstrative modifier hoia ÔthisÕ. Added to hoia ÔthisÕ it creates a word
meaning Ôthis wayÕ. Added to hoka/hoika/heaka, ika and koka~oka, it creates a word
meaning Ôfrom here/there/ etc.Õ. In other words, it indicates that the reference of the
deictic is not a single point, as it usually is, but an extended range. It only occurs on
deictics used in clauses with motion predicates. The name ÔextendedÕ is taken from the
literature on Inuktitut (see e.g. Denny 1982: 360), where the term exists in opposition to
ÔnonextendedÕ, or ÔrestrictedÕ, and refers to Òstretches or areas of spaceÓ rather than
things located on one spot.
This suffix is also used on the interrogative ria ÔwhereÕ to express a similar meaning
(see Section 17.1.4); and on verbs, to indicate that the action is carried out all over the
place, or again and again, that is, iteratively or distributively. See Section 12.4.5 for a
discussion of its use with verbs.

rk1 0898.10.3 THE PRESENTATIVE SUFFIX -RI AND THE PREDICATIVE SUFFIXES -O/-OM/-VThe Presentative suffix -ri appears on demonstratives hoia ÔthisÕ and oia Ôthe otherÕ
(although not on foia ÔsheÕ); and on the locative deictics hoka/hoika/heaka
Ôhere/there/there farÕ; aka Ôthen, so, etc.Õ, ika ÔthereÕ and igala ÔthereÕ. The Presentative
suffix itself can be followed by the gender-marked Predicative suffixes -o (feminine)
and -om (masculine/neuter). These suffixes derive predicative deictics from -ri forms.
First the meaning of the Presentative suffix will be examined; after this is a discussion
of the gender-marked Predicative suffixes.
The Presentative suffix -ri derives a presentative form of a deictic, something like the
French voilˆ. Presentatives also occur in languages closer to the Solomons, for example
in Maybrat, a West Papuan Phylum language (Dol 1998). Presentatives are described by
Anderson and Keenan as demonstratives Òwhich are used to indicate an itemÕs location
or to signal its appearance in (or relative to) the observational field of the Sp[eaker]Ó
1888 - D EICTICS(1985: 279). FillmoreÕs Sentential Demonstrative is essentially the same phenomenon as
what is here described as a presentative demonstrative:
A Sentential Demonstrative ... is a demonstrative that can stand alone as a sentence,
having what can be called a Presentative function. These are sentences whose meanings
are something like ÔBehold!Õ or maybe ÔLook at this!Õ. Latin ecce, French voilˆ, SerboCroatian evo, are examples of Sentential Demonstratives. Often a noun or pronoun
indicating the object being presented occurs in construction with a Sentential
Demonstrative, as in French Le voilˆ, Serbo-Croatian Evo ga, both meaning ÔHere he
isÕ. (1982: 47)This is the most common pragmatic function of LavukaleveÕs Presentative suffix 4.
There are a couple of other related functions associated with this suffix. If a deictic is
used on its own as a single-word utterance, as, for instance, the answer to a question
where? or how?, it must appear with the Presentative suffix. For example, in showing
someone how to do something, an action will be accompanied by the single-word
utterance:
87)Akari!
aka
-ri
then5
-PSNV
[Do] like that!","[210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215]"
"262 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYMany words consist only of vowels. Lavukaleve allows long sequences of vowels. A
sentence example is ngai ui eua ÔI (f) eat foodÕ (1sg food(n) 3sgnO-eat-sgf).
A word can in principle consist of any number of syllables:
W->s*Monosyllabic roots are common. The longest root found is of six syllables:
manogirigiri Ôseagull sp.Õ. Most roots consist of two or three syllables. All verb roots
are vowel-final.
2.7 STRESS
Stress is realised as a slightly louder and lengthened syllable. Stress assignment is partly
fixed and partly lexically assigned. Most words have stress on their initial syllable. A
small proportion of words (something around 0.05% in the corpus) has stress on their
second syllable. Of these, many are old reduplications of the form C aVbCaVbX(X...);
that is, the word looks as if its first CV syllable has been reduplicated. Others are
obvious recent loan words which retain the stress pattern of the original word. For the
rest, there is no obvious formal reason for the non-initial stress. It appears simply to be a
property of these words. A very few words have stress on their third syllable. Those
phenomena relating to mono-morphemic words will be exemplified first. Stress patterns
in morphologically complex words will be described after this.
2.7.1 S TRESS IN MONO-MORPHEMIC WORDS· Most words have stress on the initial syllable. In particular almost all CVCV words
(including all CVCV nouns) are stressed on the initial syllable. For example:
'tata
'piruÔspiderÕ
ÔbowlineÕka'soÔnot knowÕbut note also:· Many two-syllable words of the form CVCVC have stress on the second syllable:
ni'kol
fa'luk
fo'salÔfirstÕ
ÔcabbageÕ
ÔfishÕThis is not always the case however:272 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGY'legis
'mikat
'hamusÔleafÕ
ÔcentipedeÕ
ÔnightÕ· Words of the shape CaVbCaVbX(X...), in which the first CV is identical to the second
CV, invariably receive stress on the second syllable:
tu'tuk
va'var
le'lengaÔtorsoÕ
ÔtalkÕ
ÔpuddingÕThese words are considered old reduplications because of their initial syllable; the
unreduplicated part is not synchronically analysable.
·Words of other syllable structures receive initial or second syllable stress. Some
examples:VCVVe'rau
'urioÔfallÕ
ÔcrabÕCVCVVVbu'taeo
'siriaeÔeagleÕ
ÔfishingÕCVVCVle'usa
'beataÔbetel nut slatsÕ
Ôleatherback turtleÕMost of the words with stress on the second syllable are nouns. There are also a couple
of particles and adjectives, and a handful of verbs.
·A few words have stress on their third syllable:
fela'koe
mala'gula
lau'rario
mita'keuÔvillageÕ
ÔbirdÕ
ÔpraiseÕ
ÔdogÕ· Recently borrowed words always receive stress in the place it would occur in the
source language (even if extra syllables have been added in order to make the word
conform with Lavukaleve phonotactics):
'kavis
ta'rak
'daevaÔcabbageÕ (from Pijin 'kavis)
ÔtruckÕ (from Pijin 'traki)
ÔgogglesÕ (from Pijin 'daeva)282 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGY·Secondary stress occurs every second syllable in either direction from the syllable
with primary stress:
'mano'giri'giri
'lovi'tan
'mita'keuÔseagull spÕ
Ôeel sp.Õ
ÔdogÕ2.7.2 S TRESS IN MORPHOLOGICALLY COMPLEX WORDSAll lexical roots have stress. Generally, affixes do not have their own stress. In certain
circumstances, however, the Possessive prefixes cause stress shifts on the words in
which they occur.
A lexical root with affixes (not including the Possessive prefixes) will retain its stress
even when prefixes occur on the verb:
'liki
o-'liki
o-ma-'likiÔwantÕ
Ô[someone] wants itÕ
Ôthey want itÕMonosyllabic roots receive stress when affixed:
'na
e-'naÔinÕ
Ôin itÕHowever when a noun or verb receives the Possessive prefix, stress shifts occur, under
certain very constrained circumstances.
S TRESS SHIFTS WITH POSSESSIVE PREFIX ON NOUNSSuffixes do not affect the position of stress on a noun, but the Possessive prefixes
(which are, incidentally, the only prefixes available to nouns) do. If the noun is not
monosyllabic, when it gets a Possessive prefix, stress remains in the place it would be if
the prefix were not there. But if the noun is monosyllabic and is prefixed, stress moves
to the prefix. So for example:
·stress position of nouns of more than one syllable is unaffected by prefixing:
'uia
vo'vou·ÔknifeÕ
ÔboyÕo-'uia
o-vo'vouÔhis knifeÕ
Ôhis boyÕstress position of monosyllabic nouns moves when noun is prefixed:292 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGY'ta
'nu
'kivÔtimeÕ
ÔhairÕ
Ôclothes (pl)Õ'o-ta
'o-nu
'o-kivÔits timeÕ
Ôhis hairÕ
Ôhis clothes (pl)ÕOccasionally this stress shift rule has been noted with nouns of more than one syllable:
'tuaÔwifeÕ'o-tuaÔhis wifeÕThis is very rare, however.
With nouns that undergo the loss of a final vowel under Possessive prefixing (see
below, Section 2.9), when this loss of the final vowel creates a monosyllabic noun, then
this stress shift rule applies to some words but not others:
'fina
'e-finÔbelongingsÕ
Ôour belongingsÕ'langi
o-'langÔnameÕ
Ôhis nameÕbut:If there were a fixed rule to cover these situations, it would be possible to say that the
two rules, loss of final vowel for prefixed nouns, and stress shift for prefixed
monosyllabic nouns, must be ordered with respect to each other. However the fact that
both patterns appear shows that the rules do not have a fixed ordering with respect to
each other. Rather, it seems each word has its own pattern.
S TRESS SHIFTS WITH POSSESSIVE PREFIX ON VERBSThere is a construction type in which the subject of certain verbs can be crossreferenced on those verbs by a Possessive prefix instead of the usual subject prefix (or
Agreement Suffix). This construction is discussed in Section 13.4 (see also Section
2.9.3 below for description of a morphophonemic rule involved in this construction).
What is of concern here is the fact that when verbs receive a Possessive prefix, the
stress of the verb moves from its place on the verb root to the Possessive prefix:
ÔI cameÕ, is usually a-'vo, but under the Possessor-subject construction it is:
1)'ngavoe
ngavo
1sgPOSS- come-e
-PSVI came302 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYSimilarly, Ôhe went upÕ is usually o'feu, but under the Possessor-subject construction it
is:
2)'ofei
o3sgPOSS-feu
go.up-i
-PSVhe went upThe stress on such prefixes is very marked. Occasionally stress does occur in the subject
prefix of regular verbs. Normally, Ôhe cameÕ is pronounced with stress on the verb root,
but occasionally one hears stress on the prefix instead:
3)'ovo
o3sgS-vo
comehe camePossessor-subject constructions seem to be a relatively new construction coming into
the language; they are used very commonly by younger people, especially children and
teenagers, and almost never by older people. It is possible that the stress pattern of this
new and popular construction is leaching into regularly-marked verbs. Formal factors
aid the transfer. Possessive prefixes are formally identical to subject prefixes apart from
the 1st singular form. So for most forms, only the form of the verb (not including the
subject prefix) and the stress pattern mark the fact that the construction is a Possessorsubject construction. The Possessor-subject construction is only available to a very
small number of verbs. It is no large step for speakers to start to use this stress pattern
on other verbs apart from just the verbs of Possessor-subject constructions.
2.7.3 HEARING STRESS VERSUS IDENTICAL-VOWEL SEQUENCESIt was said above that stress is realised as a longer and louder syllable. There are no
long vowels phonemically in Lavukaleve, but there are identical vowel sequences,
which are realised essentially as long vowels (see Section 2.5 above). Because of the
association between length and stress, and the partly unpredictable nature of stress, it is
sometimes a difficult matter in individual words to decide if a vowel sound is long
because it is stressed, or long because it is a sequence of two identical vowels. For some
words morphophonemic tests can be applied to distinguish between the two analyses.
Stress shift rules such as those described above can be utilised; if it is possible to put the
word in question into a construction in which a stress shift rule will apply, one can then
discern whether the syllable in question still sounds long (in which case it is an instance312 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYof an identical-vowel sequence) or not (in which case it is a stressed syllable)2.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"

·Strong emphasisHeo may be used in situations where the speaker wishes to convey strong emphasis. The
emphasis is associated not just with the constituent with which the focus marker agrees,
but over the whole sentence. The emphasis may be of various kinds.
In the first example, a story-teller, Savaka, is telling a story about a fish poison, called
hola. Savaka introduces the story, talking about what the ancestors used to do in the
olden days, then saying that this is going to be a story about hola. Then he turns to a man
at his side and says ÒThatÕs your name!Ó, to general laughter from the audience. He is
making a pun; the word hola also means ÔliarÕ. The construction Savaka uses to make the
pun is this (small caps are used to show strong emphasis here):

ItÕs your name!e1 052That is, the clause could be constructed using either heo, as Savaka used, or feo.
However if feo was used, the emphatic point would not be made; and the statement
would no longer be a joke.
In the following pair, either heo or feo may be used, but using heo is more emphatic. It
is contrastive here; the speaker is referring to the two people who started the village of11The -a- in the first of these examples is a meaningless syllable added by the speaker for special
humorous effect, during the story from which the sentence is taken. When I elicited the second example,
my informant added the -a- as well, in parallel with this example which I had just given him for
comparison. Both sentences could occur without it.","[311, 312, 313]"

Dual

-nul
-nuvA rare variant of this suffix is -no ~-nol ~-nov. These two forms of the suffix reflect
variant pronunciations. They mean the same thing.
The Present Tense suffix is not obligatory, and in fact cannot be used on a verb which
has any other morphology apart from object marking.
The Present Tense suffix is actually quite rare in texts, but it is extremely common in
conversation. Texts in my corpus are mostly about events in the past, or habitual events
using habitual aspectual morphology. When the Present Tense marker does come up it
is usually in the context of quoted speech, or for vivid impact, using the so-called
Òhistorical presentÓ (Chung and Timberlake 1985: 213), which is a common
phenomenon cross-linguistically.
In natural conversation, however, the Present Tense marker is extremely common,
particularly in interchanges like example (14) below, where someone asks the
whereabouts of a woman, and is answered with what the woman is doing: SheÕs
sleeping, sheÕs making pudding, sheÕs swimming, and so on.

b1 01741517 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATION17.2 NEGATION
There are a number of means by which a word or a clause can be negated. Verbs can be
negated using the verbal suffix -la, which usually, but not necessarily, involves a focus
construction. NPs can be negated using the adjective ro ÔoneÕ, with its negative suffix
-ru to mean Ônot oneÕ. Adjectives and whole propositions can be negated using the
intransitive verb tave Ôbe notÕ. An entire proposition or an NP can be negated using the
particle tamu ÔnotÕ. A negative command can be given, using the Admonitive verbal
suffix -n. In addition there are various lexical items which have a negative meaning.
The syntax and semantics of these methods of negation will be discussed. The method
of expressing not wanting, while not actually a syntactically negative construction,
nonetheless belongs in this semantic area, and is also discussed below.
17.2.1 THE VERBAL SUFFIX -LAThe verbal suffix -la (glossed NEG) is used to negate a verb. It co-occurs with little
other verbal morphology: only an object prefix if the verb is transitive, the Causative
suffix (which precedes it) and the Agreement Suffix (which follows it). Negative
expressions involving the negative suffix -la are almost always expressed in focus
constructions. This is a stylistic rather than obligatory syntactic matter, but nevertheless
it is unusual to see a negated verb not in a focus construction.
It was explained in Chapter 11 that all verbal predications, negated or otherwise, may
appear in a focus construction, with the type of focus being shown by means of which
core participant is indexed with the Agreement Suffix and the focus marker. In all
transitive non-negative predication types in which there is a focus marker immediately
following the verb, the speaker may choose whether the Agreement Suffix and focus
marker will agree with the subject or object of the verb; the choice depends on what
type of focus the speaker wishes to express; either sentence focus or predicate focus. In
negated clauses, however, there is no choice: the Agreement Suffix and focus marker
must obligatorily agree with the subject of the verb (in positive sentences this agreement
system would mark sentence focus).
Some examples will illustrate these points. The examples show a negated verb, with the
Agreement Suffix, followed by a focus marker, both agreeing with the subject of the
clause.

"1165 - NOUN FORMATIONMany words show alternate plural marking strategies. These include nouns of all three
genders, and the interchange between different suffixes shows some interesting
tendencies. Some masculine and neuter nouns show some interchange involving -kal.
Thus for example:
SG FORM
vage ÔmoundÕ (m)
bili ÔpuddleÕ (n)
hai ÔheadlandÕ (n)PLURAL FORMSvagen or vagekal
bilial or bilikal
haiverav or haikalThere are also alternative masculine and neuter forms which involve other variants:
WORDPLURAL FORMSmasiv ÔyearÕ (m)
tail ÔhouseÕ (n)
namu ÔplaceÕ (n)masivaul or masiv
tailverav or tailav
namuv or namuFor feminine nouns which have alternative plural marking strategies, one of the
alternatives is always -vil. Thus, for example:
WORDPLURAL FORMSsolo ÔmountainÕ (f)
tata ÔspiderÕ (f)
fiata ÔgunÕ (f)
tagio ÔsnakeÕ (f)solokal or solovil
tata or tatavil
fiatev or fiatavil
tagiv or tagiovilThis pattern suggests that -vil is replacing other feminine plural-marking strategies,
perhaps indicating a process of regularisation.
It can be seen from these few examples that some of the words which show alternative
number-marking strategies are very common, frequently-used words (e.g. namu
ÔplaceÕ, tail ÔhouseÕ, masiv ÔyearÕ) whereas others are much less frequent (e.g. fakon
Ôk.o. fishÕ; bili ÔpuddleÕ, fiata ÔgunÕ).
It seems that there are generational differences between the use of some of these forms.
Older people tend to use the less regular forms, and teenagers and children tend to use
the more regular forms, especially the -kal and -vil alternatives, which require less
morphophonemic alternations, and can easily attach to any phonological stem type.
HOMONYMSHomonyms provide evidence that while phonological criteria are important, they are not
the only means by which the dual or plural form of a noun is determined. In some cases,
two homonyms have the same dual and/or plural form; in other cases, they are different.

agreement and cross-referencing. These pluralia tantum nouns sometimes refer to
things which usually or always include many items (e.g. neo ÔteethÕ). Most are mass
nouns (e.g. leruv ÔfleshÕ, gigil ÔmeasurementsÕ, vui ÔbreathÕ, kirav ÔsmellÕ, ura
ÔsteamÕ). One further word is hard to understand from an outsiderÕs point of view: isia
Ôboat sternÕ. There are no words which are obligatorily dual.","[142, 143, 144]"

jn2 07316.1.7 S URPRISE CLAUSESThe verbal suffix -meon SURPrise is extremely rare. It occurs on verbs of subordinate
adverbial clauses, so it utilises the special subordinate participant marking system, as
Potential and Anterior subordinate verbs do. No other morphology, apart from these
participant marking morphemes, occurs on verbs suffixed with -meon (although it is
likely that the Causative suffix is possible).
The suffix has a meaning related to expressing a surprising and exciting event, and is
often used at the crux of a story. The suffixed verb itself does not indicate the surprise,
but rather, it indicates a lead-up to the surprising event in the following clause. It tells
the hearer that something surprising is about to happen. It is something like the function
of the English phrase Ôwould you believe itÕ. So the first example below could be more
freely translated as something like ÔHe threw the knife, and would you believe it, it split
his mouth in two!Õ:39416 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSES

die -du.nShe comes up, then she thrashes her tail, and two canoes are wrecked [lit. die].ja 074In accordance with its meaning of setting up for a surprising event, the -meon verb is
almost invariably followed by the particle ta or taman which, broadly speaking, means
ÔjustÕ, ÔbutÕ and so on. The combination means something like Ôjust as X was
happening, then Y!Õ.
16.2 PURPOSIVE CLAUSES
Purposive subordinate clauses are marked by the verbal suffix -ham. They differ from
adverbial subordinate clauses in that they do not receive the split-ergative participant
marking system. Instead they mark their participants in the same way as independent
clauses, but using only subject and object prefixes, not the Agreement Suffix, which is
incompatible with the Purposive verbal suffix. Note, however, that subject prefixes are
rare with Purposive verbs.","[419, 420, 421]"
"27911 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS11.6 FURTHER DISCUSSION
11.6.1 NO MARKED FOCUSNot all Lavukaleve sentences have marked focus; in fact only about a third do. Under
LambrechtÕs analysis, all sentences convey information; they all have information
structure, and thus they all have focus. This is certainly true for Lavukaleve, as for all
languages. The above analysis has suggested that are two types of sentences in
Lavukaleve: those with grammatical focus constructions, and those without. By this,
however, it should not be understood that those sentences which do not employ a focus
construction do not have focus. Rather, in those sentences which do not employ focus
constructions, speakers are still conveying information about something; they are still
dividing their speech into presupposition and assertion; but they are not making this
distinction grammatically overt in the way a focus construction does. In other languages
with grammatically marked focus systems, for example Somali (Saeed 1984), the focus
system is likewise not used in every single sentence of the language.
If one thinks for a moment of focus constructions like LavukaleveÕs, or SomaliÕs, as
operating in a broadly similar functional domain as, for example, cleft constructions in
English (although LavukaleveÕs focus system and English clefts are very different types
of phenomena; see next section), then one can more easily understand why they are not
used for every sentence. In English, every sentence has information structure, but only
some have cleft constructions to make overt this information structure. In Lavukaleve, an
equivalent situation obtains, although the proportion of sentences with focus
constructions is far higher, corresponding to their considerably wider syntactic
possibilities, than clefts in English.
11.6.2 DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN FOCUS MARKERS AND COPULASSentence-Internal focus constructions share many similarities with cleft constructions in
other languages. Functionally, they often serve to express the same kinds of pragmatic
meanings as cleft constructions with copulas do in languages that have them (see e.g.
Stenson (1981) on Irish). They serve to mark focus on a particular argument, and,
especially when the Sentence-Internal focus marker occurs in construction with a
constituent at the start of the sentence, one could interpret the Sentence-Internal focus
constituent as a copula clause, at the front of, and in construction with, the main clause.
However Lavukaleve focus markers cannot be analysed as copulas.
The focus marker is not obligatory in non-verbal predications. All the examples given
above could equally well appear without the focus marker. The distribution of focus
markers in non-verbal clauses is identical to their distribution in verbal clauses. In both
cases, it is pragmatic factors of focus marking which determine whether these words will
appear in a clause or not; whether the clause is verbal or non-verbal is irrelevant. Rather,
non-verbal clauses, like verbal clauses, may or may not be grammatically marked for
28011 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSfocus, and thus can appear with or without the focus marker, on those grounds alone.
There are two further major syntactic objections to treating the focus markers as copulas.
The first is that normally, the constituent which the focus marker is in construction with
does not move to the front of the sentence. Instead it stays in its place within the clause.
The focus marker appears immediately after it. Consider the following example:
81)Aira
la
aira
la
woman(f) sgfArtumalau
o
uvikola
umalau

kumara(m) and cassava(m)The woman planted kumara and cassava.fiv
onorev
fiv
onore -v
3plFOC 3sgS- plant -plhiv.
hiv
3plEFOC
e2 014bIt is possible to say umalau o uvikola fiv, aira la onorev hiv, but usually people
donÕt. They leave the focussed constituent in place in the clause. The fact that these
focussed constituents are not extracted makes a cleft analysis problematic.
There is a further problem with analysing Lavukaleve focus markers as copulas, even if
one does not argue that sentences like these are clefts. If one argues that the SentenceInternal focus marker is a copula, then one would be forced to say that in Lavukaleve it is
possible to intersperse a main clause with an embedded copula clause. That is, in the
above example (81), one would have to say that umalau o uvikola fiv is a copula
clause, embedded in the sentence aira la onorev hiv. These objections make very
unattractive the analysis that clauses with Sentence-Internal focus markers are copula
clauses.
11.6.3 FOCUS SYSTEM VERSUS ALIGNMENT SYSTEMIt is possible to be misled by the agreement patterns of the Agreement Suffix on the verb
and the focus marker into thinking that they form part of a syntactic alignment system.
Consider for example, that in positive clauses the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus
marker generally agree with O of a transitive clause and S of an intransitive clause; and
that the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker agree with A/S in negative clauses.
This phenomenon might suggest that the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker are
actually forming part of a split-ergative agreement system determined on purely syntactic
principles. There are a number of reasons why this analysis would be unsatisfactory.
Firstly, not all positive clauses have the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker
agreeing with O; sometimes they agree with A. So one would have to find syntactic
reasons why in these cases agreement was with A, not O. One could argue that the splitergative system was based on partially syntactic and partially pragmatic principles; and
this kind of system does occur (rarely) in the languages of the world (see e.g. Dixon
1994: 211). But such an analysis would fail to account for the pragmatic function of the
focus marker in the sentences in which it occurs; and it would miss the generalisation that
the agreement of the focus marker (and verbal Agreement Suffix) can be predicted without28111 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSexception by knowing which part of a sentence is being focussed on.9
11.6.4 A TYPOLOGICAL NOTELambrecht and Polinsky (1997) propose some typological universals with respect to the
grammatical encoding of sentence focus. They argue that there is a formal, paradigmatic
relationship between predicate focus and sentence focus constructions in languages:
Ò[sentence focus] constructions have the form they do because they are to be minimally
distinct from corresponding [predicate focus] constructions within a given languageÓ
(Lambrecht and Polinsky 1997: 191).
As a corollary of this, as sentence focus involves lack of a topic-comment structure, it is
important that the subject of a sentence focus construction must be marked in such a way
that it cannot be interpreted as a topic; thus, Ò[sentence focus] marking crucially involves
DETOPICALIZATION of the nominal constituents involvedÓ (p. 191). This detopicalisation can
be accomplished in one of two ways: either by cancelling formal properties typically
associated with topic arguments; or by coding the subject of a sentence focus construction
formally in a way typically associated with focus arguments. This leads to their Principle
of Subject-Object Neutralisation, which says that subjects of sentence focus constructions
are grammatically coded with properties typically associated with objects; and their
Principle of Topic Cancellation, which says that the subject of a sentence focus sentence
cannot be coded in a similar formal way to topics.
In English, sentence focus is marked formally by a prosodic accent on the subject NP.
This marking type, they say, comes about through paradigmatic opposition to predicate
focus marking in English, in which the prosodic accent is on the object: Òthe position of
the accent on the subject noun in the [sentence focus] construction is the result purely of a
formal requirement: the need to indicate a paradigmatic contrastÓ (p. 195). They present a
typology of formal marking of sentence focus, as opposed to predicate focus: sentence
focus marking in a given language may involve prosodic inversion, that is, giving the
sentence focus subject the prosodic accent usually associated with an object (or predicate);
changes to linear order; making the subject a single constituent within the predicate
(syntactic inversion); making the subject a non-topic; giving it non-nominative case
marking; or giving the verb impersonal agreement. Lavukaleve does not fit with any of
these formal marking strategies, but even though the material it uses to mark sentence
focus versus predicate focus is not covered in Lambrecht and PolinskyÕs typology, the
system it uses to mark the opposition between sentence focus and predicate focus is
exactly parallel to those used in many other languages.
That is, focus marker agreement in sentence focus and predicate focus constructions in
9Note that a split-ergative system does exist elsewhere in Lavukaleve. In subordinate adverbial clauses
first and second person subjects follow a nominative/accusative participant marking system, and third
person subjects follow an ergative/absolutive marking system: see Section 16.1.","[305, 306, 307, 308]"

3plFOCThat's why people know their clan and they know their tribe.jh 043Examples like the sentence above bring up one important issue. It was said earlier that
sentence focus is focus over an entire sentence, from the first element, the subject NP,
through to the verb. But often adjuncts come before the subject NP in a sentence, and in
this case it is not completely clear whether the focus extends over them, as part of the
sentence, or whether the focus starts at the subject. The analysis offered here, that focus
marker agreement indicates scope, suggests that adjuncts before the subject do not form
part of the scope of focus, and that the focus does indeed only start at the subject. It does
suggest however that adjuncts between the subject and the verb are within the scope of
focus. This is a very difficult matter to test, and it needs to be investigated more
thoroughly.
Note that sentence focus is pragmatically marked. This means that such sentences are
heard in texts, but out of context sentences in elicitation are usually rejected by speakers:

pragmatically marked; it exists to express particular pragmatic meanings, which in general
do not come up in non-contextualised speech. In out-of-context sentences a more marked
focus construction is unexpected, and therefore difficult to interpret, and thus speakers
usually assume such a construction is a mistake in focus marker/verb agreement.
The next four examples are negative Sentence-Final focus constructions, in which the
focus marker always shows subject agreement (i.e. sentence focus) in Lavukaleve. This
represents a grammaticalisation of the pragmatic functions of the focus marker in negative
constructions. In negative focussed sentences, the focus marker is no longer signalling a
pragmatic choice of focus marking; instead the focus marker has become obligatory, and
the pragmatic function is lost:

object with a negative Sentence-Final focus construction. For example, (30) above, The
man didnÕt see the woman, using subject agreement, would also be used as the way to
express It was the woman that the man didnÕt see. That is, there is no grammatical
construction for expressing focus on an object in a negative sentence focus construction.
Similarly, there is no grammatical construction for expressing focus on a subject in a
negative sentence focus construction (It was the man who didnÕt see the woman).
So far the discussion has been confined to focus constructions with transitive sentences.
It has been shown that object agreement in Sentence-Final focus constructions correlates
with predicate focus, and subject agreement in Sentence-Final focus constructions
correlates with sentence focus. Intransitive and single-NP non-verbal sentence-final focus
constructions have more limited agreement possibilities, and thus it is impossible to make
so many distinctions in them.
INTRANSITIVE CLAUSESIntransitive clause constructions always show agreement with the subject. Thus, in the
terms in which transitive clauses have been analysed, intransitive Sentence-Final focus
constructions all show sentence focus. It is not possible for such sentences to show
predicate focus, as there is no object NP for the focus marker to agree with. Some
examples:26211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS

article and demonstrative modifier. This makes a certain amount of intuitive sense: the
definite article and demonstrative modifier, both marking definiteness, refer to an entity
as something that both speaker and addressee can be expected to be able to identify.
This is consistent with the functions of mea, which marks an entity as one that the
speaker knows and expects their addressee to be able to identify. However, even though
it makes intuitive sense for mea and the definite article or demonstrative modifier to cooccur, it is still not possible to predict when the definite article or demonstrative
modifier would occur with mea and when they would not. This is a subtle area, difficult
for a non-native speaker to fully understand.
Even though it is not strictly relevant to NP structure, it is worthwhile, in this discussion
of mea, to note that mea can also occur in a non-adjectival use, in construction with
particles and nominal adjuncts (i.e. postpositional phrases, locative-marked nouns, and
place nouns). In construction with particles and nominal adjuncts it creates either an NP
or a nominal modifier phrase with that word or phrase. In (32), the particle hano forms
an NP head together with mea, and takes the definite article. In (33), the particle akari

Example (36) shows an idiom in the language; the normal way to refer to a sibling is to
use a phrase consisting of the postposition ne ÔwithÕ (correctly prefixed) followed by
804 - NPS AND P OSSESSIONmea (suffixed to show the gender and number of the sibling in question). Literally, the
phrase means Ôthat one with me/you/etc. who you all know aboutÕ. Thus ngane mea
above is Ômy sisterÕ, and, for instance, ngone mem is Ôyour brotherÕ (2sg-with SPECsgm). In this idiom, mea frequently co-occurs with the definite article and ro, the
indefinite adjective.

THE DEFINITE ARTICLEThe definite article occurs in the final syntactic slot of an NP. Its form agrees with its
head noun in number and gender. It has the following inflectional paradigm.masc

the speaker knows the identity of, and assumes the addressee knows the identity of as
well. Definiteness may come from the referent having unique reference, from being the
only one of its kind (and therefore known to the addressee), or from being previously
introduced in the discourse. These are all well exemplified in Lavukaleve.
In the following example, the definite article appears with kui ÔsunÕ by virtue of its
unique reference; there is only one sun, and the speaker can thus assume the addressee
to have a definite referent for it.

Normally two nouns together must show an overt relationship to each other by using a
possessive construction, as shown below (Section 4.2). There are a few examples
however in which two nouns appear together to be part of a single NP, with no
possessive construction:

jn 001The italicised strings in the above examples seem on the surface to be single NPs
consisting of nominal head and demonstrative modifier. There is no evidence that the
hoiariom demonstratives are syntactically any different from bare hoia demonstratives
in such examples. However it can be argued by analogy from the use of the predicative
deictics in other contexts that these are in fact predicative deictics, just as the others are.
1988 - D EICTICSSo for instance under this analysis the string malav hovariom in example (119) would
not be an NP consisting of a head noun malav followed by attributive modifier
hovariom, functioning as subject argument of intransitive verb ka'so. Rather, the
structure would be as follows. Malav is an NP consisting solely of a head noun, which
is the subject argument of the predicate hovariom: Ôit is these peopleÕ. Thus, a more
literal unidiomatic translation for the whole sentence would be ÔSo itÕs these people,
they donÕt know [anything]Õ. And (117) ÔItÕs like that, itÕs this good life, the government
and church, they were the end of themÕ; and (118) ÔItÕs that bit, I donÕt want to say itÕ.
These adnominal-looking appearances of hoiariom are particularly frequent in the
string ta hoinariom ana Ôat that timeÕ:

co2 008The italicised string looks on the surface like a postpositional phrase, consisting of NP
ta hoinariom and postposition ana. But here too it can be argued by analogy that
hoinariom is a predicative demonstrative. The structure of the string is as follows. Ta is
a head noun, the subject argument of hoinariom; thus, together they form a clause
meaning Ôit is that timeÕ. The postposition has an ellipsed NP head (as is common); the
whole string means ÔitÕs that time, at it (there were women in the Red Cross)Õ. This is
the usual and idiomatically correct way of expressing time frames in stories.
THE AGREEMENT SYSTEM OF THE P REDICATIVE SUFFIXESThere are two kinds of agreement which are pertinent to deictics suffixed with -rio/om/v. There is the inherent agreement of demonstrative stems, and the gender/number
agreement of the Predicative suffixes.
Locative deictics do not have inherent agreement properties, but hoia ÔthisÕ and oia Ôthe
otherÕ do. As was discussed earlier in this chapter, hoia and oia stems inherently mark
the categories of number, gender and distance, and predicativised demonstratives which
are based on these hoia and oia stems retain these agreement properties.
The other type of agreement, the type under discussion here, which all deictic predicates
may display, is shown by agreement of the Predicative suffixes as follows:1998 - D EICTICS· -o Predicative (feminine singular)
· -om Predicative (masculine/neuter singular)
· -v Predicative (plural)
The masculine/neuter singular suffix is by far the most frequent of these, and the plural
suffix is actually very rare.
The referent which the deictic form agrees with may be the noun associated with the
deictic (if there is one), but it is by no means the case that it must be. It may be the
subject, object, complement or oblique argument of a nearby clause. It may be the topic
of the discourse, or the topic of a local piece of the discourse. There are absolutely no
syntactic constraints on what the predicate suffix may agree with. The only constraint is
the common sense one that the referent must be able to be retrieved by the hearer. Most
frequently the Predicative suffix will agree with the head noun of the deictic.

co 369There are some interesting observations that can be made about the use of the
Predicative suffix. Firstly, although there is so much freedom with respect to the
structural relationship between the gender agreement suffix and what referent it is
agreeing with, it is interesting to note that there are very strong tendencies among
individual speakers at particular times to use the suffix to agree with a referent in a
particular syntactic relationship to it. For example, some speakers during a story show a
tendency to use the gender suffix to agree with subjects in their discourse; others tend to
use it to agree with places; others again tend to have it agreeing with postpositional
objects. So, while it is true that speaker is completely free to use the gender suffix to
agree with any referent, in fact, speakers in particular situations show a tendency to use
the suffix to agree with the same kind of referent.
2018 - D EICTICSFor example with one speaker, Abel Moran, during one story he told, 95% of his uses of
the gender suffix in one story are to agree with the topic of the entire discourse, himself
(it is a life story). Another speaker, Frank Koau, in one story never used the gender
suffix to agree with the topic, but in 44% of cases he used it to agree with a place; and
33% of its uses are to agree with the head noun of the deictic. Raymond Kolo, however,
in one story tended to prefer to have the suffix agreeing with the subject of the deictic
predicate; 79% of his usages show this pattern.
As a final observation, the form of the gender agreement in the Predicative suffix is
noteworthy. There is a derivational suffix -io, which, added to transitive verb stems,
forms feminine abstract nouns (see Section 13.1.2). This is interesting in terms of
gender marking in Lavukaleve. Usually in Lavukaleve, feminine gender (in the singular
number) is associated with final -a (see Chapter 6); but these two morphemes, the
feminine abstract nominaliser -io, and the feminine Predicative suffix -o, are the two
places in which feminine gender is marked not by -a but by a form including -o. One
could stretch the similarity further by speculating that the feminine Predicative suffix
could actually be, historically if not synchronically, -io, with a loss of one of the /i/
vowels at the morpheme boundary between -ri and the feminine form -(i)o itself. Of
course there is no way to test this hypothesis, as the Predicative feminine gender suffix
can only appear following the Presentative suffix -ri.
8.11 DEMONSTRATIVE IDENTIFIERS
We have not quite exhausted the description of LavukaleveÕs deictics yet. There is one
further set of deictics: demonstrative identifiers. The term is from Diessel (1999), who
distinguishes demonstrative identifiers from sentential demonstratives (or predicative
demonstratives), on the grounds that demonstrative identifiers only occur in
identificational sentences (e.g. There is your sheep) (Diessel 1999: 10-15).
Formally, demonstrative identifiers in Lavukaleve are identical to foia demonstrative
pronouns, but with the addition of an extra syllable /hV/ after the first syllable of the
pronoun. The V takes its form from the vowel of the first syllable of the pronoun. Thus
foga Ôsingular proximal neuter demonstrative pronounÕ; fohoga Ô3rd person singular
proximal neuter demonstrative identifierÕ 7. It is not clear whether this is a synchronic
process, or whether it just that the paradigm is morphologically transparent.
LavukaleveÕs other deictic (and other) paradigms are for the most part morphologically
transparent.","[222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"

-DURjn2 030MORPHO-SYNTAX OF DURATIVE VERBSVerbs suffixed with the Durative aspect marker appear in some circumstances to have
unique syntactic properties. For example, Durative-marked verbs are frequently
repeated, as shown above. Under the analysis assumed here, each Durative-marked verb
(and its arguments and adjuncts) forms an independent clause; repeated verbs form
strings of coordinated independent clauses.
However the fact that some Durative-marked verbs are extremely common, for instance
sianun Ôdo-DURÕ, feunun Ôgo up-DURÕ, vaunun Ôgo out-DURÕ suggests another
analysis. Such verbs tend to be repeated at least a couple of times, and they very rarely
have any overt arguments or adjuncts. They could perhaps be considered as lexicalised
verbal adjuncts; that is, verbal adjuncts derived from verbs with the Durative suffix.
This analysis is only possible for some instances of Durative-marked verbs. It cannot
account for their use when they have overt arguments or adjuncts, or when they have
the Non-Finite suffix. On the contrary, in these uses the Durative-marked verbs clearly
form independent clauses.
Verbs containing morphology of the other marked aspect, Imperfective aspect, do not
get repeated like Durative-marked verbs, and there is no evidence to show that they are
anything other than the verbs of independent clauses.
12.4 MOOD
There are six morphologically marked categories of mood in Lavukaleve: Admonitive
-n; Punctual Imperative -va~-ila~-iva; Durative Imperative -ma~-mela~-ba; Hortative
-me; Abilitative -nen~-nan; and Extended -la.
Mood is not an obligatory category in contexts in which it is semantically appropriate;
and the presence of Mood marking is incompatible with much other verbal morphology.
The verbs on which these mood suffixes occur cannot mark any categories of Tense,
Aspect or other Moods. Neither can they be negated; and because they cannot have the
Agreement Suffix (see Chapter 10) they cannot occur in most types of focus
constructions (see Chapter 11) or relative clauses (see Section 16.3). All Mood-marked
verbs can, if transitive, appear with an object cross-referencing prefix, but some (the
Imperatives, the Hortative and the Extended) cannot occur with subject cross30612 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODreferencing prefixes. The Admonitive and Abilitative can cross-reference their subjects
with prefixes.
Other clause types expressing mood-like categories include Purposive and Potential
clauses. These categories are marked by suffixes on verbs, but, unlike the Mood
suffixes, verbs with such suffixes form subordinate clauses. These are discussed in
Chapter 16.
12.4.1 THE ADMONITIVEThere is a cluster of related meanings associated with the Admonitive suffix -n. The
core meaning, in terms of frequency at least, is the one which the suffix has been named
for: it is used to warn against something, telling the hearer to avoid something bad
happening. It sometimes contains an implied command to not do something. The suffix
is also used for a negative imperative; telling the hearer not to do something, with no
implication of avoiding anything bad that might follow from ignoring the command.
The suffix is also used to indicate that something bad might happen, without any
implied command to avoid it, or not do something. This is a deleterious possibility
usage (in the words of Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994: 211)). The suffix can, more
rarely, be used as an irrealis marker; to mean that something may happen, whether good
or bad, again with no implication that the speaker should do or not do anything to avoid
it. Lastly, the suffix may be used as an exhortative, asking that something, usually good,
should happen. This use is restricted to prayer.
These meanings, for the sake of clarity, can be schematised as follows:
· DonÕt! (negative imperative)
(No implication of trying to avoid something bad)
· Avoid something bad! (admonitive)
(Warning, sometimes an implied negative imperative)
· Something bad might happen! (deleterious possibility)
(Pointing it out, with no implication of commanding the hearer to avoid it)
· Something might happen! (irrealis)
(No indication of whether the something is good or bad, and no implication that the
hearer should avoid it)
· May something happen! (exhortative)
(Asking that something, usually good, may happen. Used in prayer.)
This is a large semantic range for one morpheme, but one can clearly see the semantic30712 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODconnections between each of the meanings. The final use, the exhortative, is perhaps
surprising given the first few meanings; but it can be understood it in terms of a slight
alteration of the irrealis meaning of Ôsomething might happenÕ to wanting something to
happen.
Bybee et al. (1994: 211) talk of an admonitive modality, which involves the speaker
issuing a warning to the addressee. They mention Alyawarra and Slave as two
languages in which a deleterious possibility marker is the same as an admonitive
marker. This is certainly the situation in Lavukaleve. Clearly at some level these
meanings are all closely related.
The following examples show the meanings of the suffix -n more clearly. Note that for
the sake of consistency, this suffix is universally glossed ADMONitive, irrespective of
its actual meaning in the context.
NEGATIVE IMPERATIVEThe negative imperative use of the suffix commands the hearer not to carry out the
action of the verb. There is no necessary implication that bad results will follow if the
hearer ignores the command. The admonitive in the negative imperative meaning is
often accompanied by sevo, a particle meaning Ôtabu/holyÕ, which can also be used by
itself to tell someone to stop doing whatever it is they are doing.

pr 00712.4.2 THE IMPERATIVESThere are two Imperative paradigms, each one with three members, marked for number
(singular, dual and plural). These Imperatives have 2nd person reference. Similar
command-type morphology for 1st inclusive reference is the Hortative -me (discussed
below, Section 12.4.3). Note also the 3rd singular exhortative form, one of the uses of
the Admonitive suffix -n (discussed above, Section 12.4.1), which also falls into a
similar semantic area. The Imperative forms discussed in this section are all positive;
the negative imperative is expressed by the Admonitive suffix -n (see above, Section
12.4.1).
The Imperatives can co-occur with subject prefixes, rarely, and they can have overt NPs
expressing the subject (usually inu Ô2nd singularÕ). But usually, as the examples show,
there is no overt mention of the subject, as its reference is assumed.
The two Imperatives differ in their meanings. The Punctual Imperative (glossed
PCTIMP) is so-named because it is used with verbs whose action can be carried out to
completion instantaneously. The Durative Imperative (glossed DURIMP) is used on the
type of verbs that would be expected to take some time to carry out to completion. This
31012 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODDurative Imperative is also used as the command form for verbs which have no
necessary endpoint. The addressee is expected to begin, but not complete, the action
instantly. The forms of the Imperatives are:SG
DU
PLPUNCTUAL IMPERATIVE
-va
-ila
-ivaDURATIVE IMPERATIVE
-ma
-mela
-baSG

PLBecause of the aspectual nature of the difference between these, some verbs are usually
found only with Punctual Imperatives, and some only with Durative Imperatives.
However, for many verbs there is a certain overlap; either Imperative can be used, with
difference illocutionary force resulting from the choice.
For example, ngoa ÔstayÕ usually only takes the Durative Imperative:

reference. It can co-occur with the Causative suffix (which it follows), and the
Agreement Suffix (which it precedes). Tense-marked verbs cannot receive Aspect or
Mood suffixation, but note that the Future Tense suffix can be used with the Habitual
Auxiliary (see Section 14.3). As tense marking does not occur on negated verbs, to
express a negative future clause, the Habitual Auxiliary with the Future Tense suffix
must be used in construction with a negated verb:

coordinate-dependent verbs which form a sequence with the following clause. It can be
easily distinguished from the Future Tense marker on morphological and semantic
grounds. A verb marked by the Non-Finite suffix cannot receive subject crossreferencing, can receive certain Aspect marking, and has no constraints on time
reference. Conversely, a Future Tense marked verb can easily occur with subject crossreferencing (as shown in the above examples), cannot receive Aspect marking (as
mentioned above) and can only have future time reference. The Non-Finite suffix is
discussed in Section 15.4.4.","[323, 324]"

emk 017NON-VERBAL CLAUSESNon-verbal clauses function in this respect similarly to verbal clauses. The focus marker
in non-verbal Sentence-Final focus constructions can in theory agree with either of the
two NPs that may be present, although in practice it is very difficult to find an example
showing the focus marker agreeing with one NP but not the other, because the
complement in almost all cases is the item of equation or identification with the subject,
and thus they both have the same agreement properties. Therefore, sentence focus and
predicate focus are distinguished in two-NP non-verbal clauses, but in practice often the
difference cannot be seen. There are some examples however which are clear:

co2 044SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONThere is, then, a Sentence-Final focus construction in Lavukaleve which allows two
different focus structures. These focus structures are signalled by agreement of the focus
marker. It is not simply the case that the focus marker agrees with what it is focussing on,
but rather it works by signalling the extent of the focus through the sentence. The
appearance of the focus marker signals that focus is an issue in the sentence. The
agreement which the focus marker displays tells the hearer what the domain of the focus
is. Thus, Lavukaleve marks the distinction between these two types of focus
grammatically.
In predicate focus, agreement extends from the focus marker at the end of the sentence to
the object argument, which occurs before the verb. Basic constituent order in Lavukaleve
is S(O)V. In sentence focus, agreement extends throughout the entire sentence from the
focus marker at the end through to the first element of the sentence, the subject. Ellipsed
NPs do not matter for the scope of focus; the focus construction utilises obligatory verbal
and focus marker morphology to express scope, and it does not in fact matter whether or
not the actual NP arguments are there for the scope to obtain. It is not clear to what extent
adjuncts are included in Sentence-Final focus constructions.
Predicate focus is the most common, unmarked focus type in Lavukaleve. This is what
one would expect from LambrechtÕs definition. A focussed predicate is what would in
26411 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSother terms have been called the comment of a topic-comment structure: Òwhen the focus
is marked on the object ... this is a grammatical signal that the unmarked relation between
presupposition and assertion obtainsÓ (Lambrecht 1987: 374). In Lavukaleve, SentenceFinal focus constructions in which the focus marker agrees with the object are predicate
focus constructions. They are the unmarked Sentence-Final focus construction type; both
in pragmatic terms and in terms of distribution.
Sentence focus is a pragmatically (and distributionally) very highly marked focus
construction. In Lavukaleve it is used for situations involving very strong, often
contrastive focus. All negative Sentence-Final focus constructions take this form too.
Lambrecht points out that sentence-focus constructions are usually used for presentational
sentences involving all-new information. ÔPresentationalÕ, refers to structures that Òare
used to introduce an NP referent, or the concept associated with some NP, into the
universe of discourseÓ (1987: 375). Such sentences have also been referred to as thetic
(e.g. Lambrecht 1987. Note though, that Sasse (1987) expresses unease at such a
correlation of thetic utterances with sentences involving focus on the entire statement.)
For Lambrecht, Ò[Sentence focus] structures express propositions in which the assertion
extends over the entire proposition, they exhibit a certain Òall-newÓ character which
distinguishes them from [predicate focus] structuresÓ (1987: 379). This all-newness of
presentational, sentence focus structures also, in many languages, becomes associated
with situations involving unexpected or surprising information: ÒThe less the cognitive
status of the NP referent warrants the use of the [sentence focus] structure, the more the
construction will give rise to the implicature that the piece of information expressed in the
[sentence focus] structure is of special importanceÓ (1987: 379). These types of pragmatic
functions are indeed present in Lavukaleve sentence-focus constructions.
It is possible, and indeed common, in Lavukaleve to express focus on a particular
argument. In this case, the focus marker is still involved, but instead of a Sentence-Final
focus construction, a Sentence-Internal focus construction must be used. The next section
describes these.
11.3.3 SENTENCE-INTERNAL FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSIn Sentence-Internal focus constructions the focus marker is in construction with a nonpredicating constituent. That is, the focus marker follows it and, if applicable, agrees in
person/gender/number with it. The non-predicating constituents can be arguments or
adjuncts. I follow Lambrecht in using the term Ôargument focusÕ to label this focus type.
It will be shown below that the same construction type that serves to convey focus on an
argument or an adjunct can also be used to convey focus on a non-main verb or the first26511 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSpart of a complex predicate6 .
This argument focus construction type is similar to what is commonly referred to as
narrow focus, as opposed to the wide focus of the sentence focus and predicate focus
constructions discussed above.
If the focussed constituent is an NP, the focus marker agrees in person, gender and
number with it. If the focussed constituent is not an NP, the focus marker receives default
agreement, that is, it appears in its 3rd person singular neuter form.
It is easiest to see argument focus operating with NP arguments. The following examples
compare Sentence-Internal focus sentences with their non-focus marked counterparts. The
minimal/near-minimal pairs are elicited; they are useful to make the structures immediately
apparent. Textual examples will be discussed after this.
The first two examples are near-minimal pairs, the first has no grammatically marked
argument focus, the second has argument focus shown by the focus marker after the
object:

e3 010eThe next three examples show the difference between a focussed NP and a non-focussed
NP. Many of the examples to follow actually contain two focus markers in one sentence.
This is an extremely common construction type in Lavukaleve. This type of sentence, the
focus-echo construction, is discussed in more detail in Section 11.5.1 below. The second
focus marker must always be the heo focus marker, and it must always agree with the
first focus marker. At this point, only the first, italicised focus markers are relevant.
Example (44) is a basic Sentence-Final focus construction, showing predicate focus (see
above). (45) and (46) show argument focus; (45) (repeated from 13) has a focussed
object, (46) a focussed subject. The second shows focus on the fish, and the third on the
woman.","[289, 290, 291, 292]"
"39716 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSES16.3 RELATIVE CLAUSES
Relative clauses are clauses which modify an NP, the head. All relative clauses in
Lavukaleve are restrictive; that is, they function to restrict the reference of the head
from any number of possible referents to only those described in the relative clause.
LavukaleveÕs relative clauses are internal relative clauses. Keenan (1985: 163) notes
that internal relative clauses are ill-attested in the languages of the world, but that all the
languages in which they are known to occur have a basic constituent order of SOV.
Lavukaleve certainly fits this generalisation.
In internal relative clauses the head noun, that is, the noun referring to the common
argument shared by the main clause and the relative clause, functions syntactically as
part of the relative clause, not as part of the main clause. In Lavukaleve, as in many
languages with internal relativisation (Keenan 1985: 163), there is no overt marker of
relativisation.
As there is no overt marker of relativisation, the only feature by which relative clauses
can be recognised in Lavukaleve is that they consist of a clause inside an NP. Consider
the following examples:
50)meham
me1pl.in-ham

-sgmI saw the man who ate my fish.na
na
sgmArtalem
fin.
ale -m
fin
1sgS- see -sgm 3sgmFOC
e3 008h/2In the first example, the whole relative clause consists of meham sevo osum Ôa promise
he made to usÕ. The head noun sevo occurs after the postpositional phrase and before
the relative verb. The relative clause functions as a noun, and is followed by the definite
article. The NP thus formed functions as the object of the main verb olugurem Ôhe will
respect itÕ.
In the second example, the italicised relative clause ali ngafo'sal aum Ôthe man who ate
my fishÕ is followed by the definite article, and functions as the object of the main
clause. This NP is the argument shared by the main clause and the relative clause.
Structurally, such examples consist of a clause followed by a definite article. Relative
39816 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSESclauses appear in the position in which adjectives appear in NPs in Lavukaleve; and
note also that both relative clauses and adjectives show agreement with their head noun
using the Agreement Suffix.
The predicates of relative clauses are always marked with the Agreement Suffix. The
Agreement Suffix agrees with the head, which helps to show which argument is the
head of the relative clause.
The head, like any noun argument in Lavukaleve, does not have to be overt. It is always
retrievable, and in any case it is cross-referenced on the relative predicate and the
definite article, and often also on the main predicate. The following example shows a
relative clause without an overt head:

3sgfO- SBD- do -POTme
HABIf [anything] went missing, they would have known it.co2 064The missing head, which would occur immediately preceding kini tataveuarea if it was
present, is presumably mina ÔthingÕ, which is feminine, and thus controls the feminine
agreement.
The head is usually a noun, but it can be a demonstrative pronoun from the oia
paradigm (see Section 8.7). It cannot be any other type of pronoun or demonstrative.
Example (57) below shows a relative clause with the oia demonstrative pronoun as
head.
The head of the relative clause may have any syntactic role in the relative clause, and
also may be in any syntactic role with respect to its function in the main clause,
although it is questionable whether it is possible to relativise on possessors (see below).
That is, the head can function as S, A, O, or postpositional object in either clause.
The predicate of a relative clause must be suffixed with the Agreement Suffix, but
otherwise has the full range of morphological possibilities of any predicate suffixed
with the Agreement Suffix (see Chapter 10 for a discussion of the functions and
morpho-syntax of the Agreement Suffix). It may also be a complex predicate; examples
(57) and (61) contain respectively a verbal complex with the Habitual Auxiliary and a
serial verb construction as predicates of relative clauses. Examples (63) and (64) are
interesting in that the relative clauses each contain two predicates, one an independent
Imperfective-marked verb, followed by another independent verb marked with the
Agreement Suffix. In fact relative clauses can consist of strings of independent clauses
like these, or indeed complex structures with subordinate clauses, or clause chains as in
39916 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSESthe example below:

work(f)The first thing I want to talk about, is mother's work. [lit: in the first thing I am wanting to talk
about, [itÕs] motherÕs work]
emk 001In the above example, the relative clause consists of a clause chaining construction (see
Chapter 15). The clause elikire Ôwanting itÕ has a nominalised object va'var hai Ôto
talkÕ, which is a coordinate-dependent clause in a clause chain, of which the
independent predicate is alei ÔI amÕ. In complex relative clause structures like this, the
principle is that the complex structure appears as it would elsewhere, but, in addition to
whatever other participant marking is called for by the construction (see Section 9.7),
the final verb of the clause receives the Agreement Suffix cross-referencing the head.
The main clause contains any elements which any main clause would normally contain.
Thus, there are two main features that distinguish relative clauses from other
construction types in Lavukaleve. Firstly, the relative clause appears inside an NP.
Secondly, the predicate of the relative clause always has the Agreement Suffix; and it
can be followed immediately by the definite article. In all other construction types, if a
predicate is followed by the definite article, the predicate must appear with the
Nominaliser suffix (described in Section 13.1); only in relative clauses can a nonnominalised predicate be followed immediately by the definite article. Note that the
definite article is not an obligatory part of the relative clause construction; it belongs to
the NP which is an argument of the verb of the relative clause. The definite article is in
its normal function as in any NP (see Section 4.1.2 for a discussion of the definite
article).
However if there was no definite article, there would be no means of recognising a
relative clause structurally as any different from an independent clause followed by
another independent clause. Consider the following example:
54)Bongihehev vone,

1sgS- stayI stayed doing work with heathens, with people who do not know the church. [lit: with people
who didn't know the church I stayed doing work]
am 06740016 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSESIn this example, the italicised part, malav mima evealav, could be seen as functionally
a relative clause, with shared argument malav functioning as subject of the relative
clause and postpositional object of the main clause. However there is no syntactic
evidence that it is a relative clause: the sentence could translate as Ôwith the heathens,
the people who donÕt know the church, with them, I stayed workingÕ; thus, as a string of
independent clauses. The only structures recognised in this description as syntactically
relative clauses are those which do involve a definite article immediately following a
verb.
Note that it is perhaps possible to analyse these structures as independent clauses, with
the definite article functioning not as a definite article but rather as a kind of resumptive
determiner; thus, example (51) could be paraphrased as Ôthe man ate my fish: him, I
sawÕ. However there are a few arguments against this analysis. Firstly, resumptive
pronouns do occur in Lavukaleve, but they are demonstrative pronouns from the foia
paradigm (see Section 8.4). This is only a minor problem. Secondly, and more
importantly, it is never possible to put a definite article anywhere after the head noun,
apart from directly after the relative verb, which is at the end of the NP under the
analysis presented here. It is certainly not possible to add another definite article after
the head noun, for example (again using 51):
55)*Ali

man(m) sgmArt 1sgPOSS- fish(m) 3sgmO- eat -sgm sgmArt 1sgS- see -sgm 3sgmFOCThis suggests that the definite article is indeed functioning in its normal definite article
function, rather than as a resumptive determiner. This in turn suggests that the analysis
here, that these structures are indeed relative clauses, is correct.
It was stated above that the head of the relative clause, that is, the argument shared
between the relative clause and the main clause, can be in any grammatical function
with respect to both the main clause and the relative clause, including any combination
of S, A, O or postpositional object. It is generally not, however, possible to relativise on
possessors. As a matter of fact, there is one example in the corpus of a relative clause
with a possessor as head. The example is:
56)Hogariom

village.
jn 036 - jn 037The head is Ôthey (the owners of the village and baskets)Õ, which is ellipsed, expressed
only in the Possessive prefix on losiv Ôtheir basketsÕ.
40116 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSESHowever the example is problematic for two reasons. Most importantly, as the
punctuation shows, the relative clause is in its own intonation unit, followed by a
sentence-final drop in pitch (indicated by the full stop). The intonation is hesitant
(slashes indicate pauses on level pitch), suggesting that the sentence is perhaps not a
complete or fluent example. Secondly, this is the only example of relativising on a
possessor. If this is a possibility in Lavukaleve, it is a possibility rarely utilised by
speakers. The area needs to be thoroughly checked with Lavukaleve speakers before
any conclusions can be drawn.
The following examples show all possible combinations of the syntactic roles of shared
arguments. Unlike the above construction, these relative clauses are quite frequent and
well-attested as an important part of Lavukaleve grammar.

hr1 029This last example is particularly interesting in that the predicate of the relative clause, ao-sea-a, is indexed for three participants: object and subject are indexed by prefixes;
and the head of the relative clause, a postpositional object, is indexed with the
Agreement Suffix. This is one of the few constructions in which a predicate can be
cross-referenced for three arguments.
In other construction types, the Agreement Suffix only indexes subjects or objects. In
relative clauses, however, it always indexes the head, and as the head may be in the
syntactic roles of subject, object or postpositional object, the Agreement Suffix in
relative clauses may in fact index arguments in the syntactic role of object of
postposition. The functions of the Agreement Suffix are discussed in detail in Chapter
10.","[423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431]"

MOD.PROX.sgm Lavukaleve 3sgnFOCI said this (m) in Lavukaleve2.rk2 015This anomalous situation presents a clash between two competing principles in
Lavukaleve. The first principle is that all transitive verbs must be cross-referenced for
their objects. The second principle is that all sentence-final focus constructions like this
one require an argument to be cross-referenced by the Agreement Suffix on the verbal
element before the focus marker (see Chapter 11). Normally these principles do not
collide, because normally in single-word predicates either subject or object can be
marked at either end of the verb, by either prefix or suffix. So it is possible always to
choose to mark the one required by the focus construction by the Agreement Suffix, and
to mark the other one by a prefix. However, in verbal complexes, marking of subject
and object occurs in a fixed position. The object must be marked on the verb, and
subject must be marked on the Habitual Auxiliary. Now, because the focus construction
requires the object to be cross-referenced by the Agreement Suffix, a morphological
dilemma arises. The language must either violate its rule of marking object on the verb
and subject on the auxiliary, or violate its rule of only marking each argument once per
predicate. The latter alternative is apparently preferable. In only this circumstance can it
mark the same argument more than once within the one predicate (although note that
there is somewhat of a similar situation in certain types of relative clauses: see Section
16.3).
The same anomaly also comes about when a speaker wants to use a prefix to crossreference the subject on the auxiliary, but also wants to use a focus construction
requiring cross-referencing of that subject: the result is that the subject gets crossreferenced twice on the auxiliary:

mn2 051-052No words, not even the focus marker, can intervene between the verb and me with the
Agreement Suffix. There are good reasons however why one would not want to say that
the me word is suffixed to the verb. The element is phonologically an independent
word; it can be said in isolation.
It is a different morphological word too. One observation in this regard relies on
parallelism with the prefixed forms of the Habitual Auxiliary. One would not want to
say that the me which is prefixed for its subject is different in its fundamental syntactic
nature from the me which receives the Agreement Suffix. All verbs are capable of
receiving either prefixes or the Agreement Suffix for participant marking, and the
Habitual Auxiliary, although it is not a verb, is no different in this respect. The me
which receives a prefix for subject is definitely a separate word from the verb which it
follows; and thus, the simplest analysis, without evidence to the contrary, is that the me
which receives the Agreement Suffix is too.
There is a further reason for saying that me with the Agreement Suffix is a separate
word from the verb, to do with participant marking. In these constructions, regardless of
the transitivity of the verb, the suffix on me agrees with the subject (S/A). If the verb is
transitive, it takes an object prefix. It is ungrammatical for an intransitive verb to take
the subject prefix and me to be unmarked; or for the transitive verb to take subject
marking and me to take object marking. If the verb and me were morphologically one
word, one would expect, judging from all other participant marking rules in the
language, that participant marking would be flexible in this respect; one would expect
subject or object to be marked at either end of the word, as it can be in any verb. The
fact that there is no flexibility here suggests that this is not one morphological word.
Rather, the rule is that the verb, if transitive, must mark its object. This is in fact a fixed
rule throughout the language; see Section 9.7 for discussion. For these reasons, me is
regarded as a separate word, both on the phonological and morphological levels, in
these (as indeed in all other) constructions.
The word me, suffixed with the Future Tense marker -re, plus the Agreement Suffix, is
used with negated verbs to express negative habitual-state meanings3. The resulting
construction differs from the construction discussed above only in that the auxiliary me
is always suffixed with the Future Tense marker -re in these constructions, and the3There are also four positive examples of this construction in a corpus of around 5000 sentences.","[381, 382]"

VERB CONSTRUCTIONS AND SUBORDINATE CLAUSESClause chaining constructions were described in the previous sections as being a
particular construction type involving one or more coordinate-dependent clauses, each
containing a predicate marked with particular morphology, followed by an independent
predicate, which finishes the sentence. This clause chaining construction type is only
one of many ways in Lavukaleve in which to join verbs and clauses; it is worthwhile to
look briefly at each of the other ways in turn, to show that each one is structurally easily
distinguishable from clause chaining constructions.
INDEPENDENT COORDINATE CONSTRUCTIONSTwo or more independent clauses can be joined by the use of a conjunction. There is a
small number of conjunctions in Lavukaleve, including aka Ôthen, soÕ; hano Ôthen,
after, finishedÕ; leta ÔbutÕ; olang ÔbecauseÕ. These conjunctions are listed in Section
3.10. Of concern here is the structural differences between clauses joined using such
conjunctions, and clause chains. The major difference is that all the clauses joined using
conjunctions are independent; that is, they can freely stand on their own as complete
utterances. In addition, they can take the full range of TAM and participant marking
morphology normally available to independent predicates (and, for the most part, not
37715 - CLAUSE C HAININGavailable to coordinate-dependent predicates). For example note the conjunction aka
ÔthenÕ joining the two sentences in square brackets (each one a clause chaining
construction):

co 172Independent coordinate constructions are not common in Lavukaleve. It is certainly not
the preferred way of joining clauses. Instead, speakers prefer to join clauses using
clause chaining constructions or subordinate constructions.
S ERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONSClause chaining constructions are structurally very different to serial verb constructions.
Serial verb constructions are a type of predicate; clause chaining constructions are a
type of sentence. Clause chaining constructions consist of one or more coordinatedependent clauses, which are dependent on a following independent clause. Serial verb
constructions, however, do not have this relationship of dependence; each verb of a
serial verb construction is structurally equivalent to each of the other verbs in the
construction.
Serial verb constructions (discussed in Section 14.1) consist of a sequence of verbs
which occupy a single predicate slot. Like in clause chaining constructions, each of the
verbs must cross-reference its own object, but, unlike in clause chaining constructions,
the verbs do not take any morphology to show what relationship they have to each
other. A serial verb construction can mark subject arguments and TAM distinctions, but
only once across the whole predicate. Coordinate-dependent verbs cannot mark subject
arguments or TAM distinctions at all. Serial verb constructions can in fact act as a
coordinate-dependent predicate as part of a clause chaining construction, as the
37815 - CLAUSE C HAININGfollowing example shows (see also many previous examples in this chapter, including
(1), (22) and (25)):

Firstly, subordinate clauses are embedded within their main (independent) clauses, and
function either as an argument or a modification of their main clause. Subordinate
relative and purposive clauses bear little structural relationship to coordinate-dependent
clauses, and are not considered further here.
Subordinate adverbial clauses have predicates which are specifically marked with
special morphology which shows their semantic and syntactic relationship to the
independent clause, by using one of the Anterior suffix -ge; the Potential suffix -le or
the Surprise suffix -meon (see Section 16.1). They differ morphologically from
coordinate-dependent clauses in that coordinate-dependent clauses can never under any
circumstances cross-reference their subjects, whereas subordinate adverbial clauses can.
Subordinate adverbial clauses, if intransitive, have their own system of participant
marking, whereby third person subjects are cross-referenced as objects, in a splitergative marking system, and a special prefix e- holds the place of the normal subject
prefix.
Subordinate adverbial clauses can in fact be used to modify coordinate-dependent
clauses in clause chaining constructions. For example consider the following:

describes what the anterior conditions for the completion of the sou falere clause were.
Note that the first and second coordinate-dependent predicates in this fragment, foa
fufure Ôlying downÕ and sou falere Ôstanding upÕ, are serial verb constructions.
15.5 CLAUSE CHAINING IN OTHER PAPUAN LANGUAGES
One might not expect necessarily to find structural similarities between Lavukaleve and
other Papuan languages; the term Papuan, after all, simply means that the language in
question is from a certain region of the world and is not Austronesian. Nevertheless,
constructions very similar to the one described in this chapter are very characteristic of
mainland Papuan languages, and it is worthwhile to look at how LavukaleveÕs clause
chaining constructions compare with clause chaining constructions in other languages.
Such constructions are not at all characteristic of the Oceanic languages surrounding
Lavukaleve.
LavukaleveÕs clause chaining constructions are similar in most respects to the wellknown examples in other Papuan languages, for instance Hua (Haiman 1980) and Tauya
(MacDonald 1990). Foley (1986) in his discussion of clause chaining constructions
mentions the following features as typical of such constructions in Papuan languages.
Typically coordinate-dependent verbs in Papuan languages have no tense marking
(Foley 1986: 196), and in fact their inflections are normally stripped down, often
including only a linking morpheme to show that they are in a clause chaining
construction (1986: 180). Typically, the temporal relation between the coordinatedependent and final independent verbs is marked; thus coordinate-dependent verbs
often mark whether their action is simultaneous with or sequential to the independent
(final) verb (1986: 180). Often Papuan languages with clause chaining constructions
have a switch-reference system, or some other tracking mechanism to show whether the
actor of a coordinate-dependent verb is the same as or different to the actors of other
verbs in the sequence. Final independent verbs are fully inflected verbs which contain
all information regarding TAM and person marking.
In Lavukaleve the situation is quite similar. Coordinate-dependent predicates carry
object marking if transitive, and carry a suffix to show their temporal relationship with
the next clause. Independent predicates in Lavukaleve carry full participant marking.
One place in which Lavukaleve differs from many Papuan languages is that in
Lavukaleve there is no obligation for the predicates of clause chains to share their
subjects, or to mark whether or not the subjects are shared, so there is no need for a
switch-reference system or some other mechanism to do this. In this respect,
Lavukaleve is similar to Yimas, which does not have a switch-reference system, and
does not require clause chains to have the same subjects (Foley 1991: 446). Also,
Lavukaleve does not have the simultaneous/sequential distinction which many
languages with clause chains make.
380CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Subordinate clauses
It was shown in Section 9.5 that there is a major division in clause types in Lavukaleve,
between independent (main) and dependent clauses. Dependent clauses themselves are
of two types: coordinate-dependent and subordinate-dependent. Coordinate-dependent
clauses are discussed in the previous chapter, Chapter 15. Subordinate-dependent
clauses, henceforth to be called simply subordinate clauses, are discussed in this
chapter.
Lavukaleve has three types of subordinate clauses: adverbial clauses, purposive clauses
and relative clauses. There are three different types of adverbial clauses, all marked by
verbal suffixation, and by changes in participant marking of the predicate, involving a
split-ergative system with 3rd person subjects following an ergative/absolutive marking
pattern and 1st and 2nd person subjects following a nominative/accusative marking
pattern. Purposive clauses too are marked by verbal suffixation, but do not have a splitergative marking system. Lavukaleve has internal relative clauses. That is, the argument
shared between the relative clause and the main clause is syntactically a part of the
relative clause, not the main clause. The following table summarises the basic morphosyntactic information to be covered in this chapter:

functional domains of complement clauses in other languages. For example the
complement of wanting is usually expressed as a nominalised clause (see Section 13.1
for a discussion of nominalisation). Example (49) below shows another common
construction in this functional domain: in He told them to go the verb of telling is
expressed as a subordinate Anterior clause, dependent on the verb go; thus, Him telling
them, they went. By such means as these the functional domain often expressed by
complement clauses in other languages is expressed in Lavukaleve.
The three major subordinate clause types, while they are all subordinate clauses, differ
markedly in their morpho-syntactic characteristics, and in the semantic functions which
they serve to express. This chapter, then, falls into three separate parts: a discussion of
adverbial clauses is followed by a description of purposive clauses then relative clauses.
16.1 ADVERBIAL CLAUSES
Adverbial clauses are subordinate clauses which add temporal, spatial, and other types
of meanings to the main clause. There are three kinds in Lavukaleve: Potential clauses,
Anterior clauses, and Surprise clauses. Adverbial clauses are marked by two means:
firstly, there is a suffix on the predicate of the subordinate clause. The suffix, as well as
showing that the predicate is subordinate, indicates the semantic relationship of the
adverbial clause to the main clause. Secondly, these clauses are marked by a very
special sort of participant marking. In this participant marking system, the surface
marking of grammatical relations within the subordinate clause is altered such that in
intransitive clauses the logical intransitive subject is cross-referenced using an object
prefix, and an invariant prefix e- holds the second prefix position, the position normally
reserved for cross-referencing to the subject of a transitive verb. This pattern only
applies to third-person subjects; first and second person subjects are marked as in main
clauses. It also only applies to intransitive predicates; transitive predicates use normal
main-clause participant marking strategies.
The system of participant marking in these clause types is described in the first sections;
firstly for verbs, then for the Habitual Auxiliary. This is a rather complicated area of the
language, and takes quite some explanation. The actual clause types, Anterior, Potential
and Surprise, are discussed only after this preliminary material has been dealt with. It is
necessary to explain the participant marking first in order for the reader to be able to
understand the examples of these adverbial clauses, which is the main descriptive task
of this section.
As with coordinate-dependent clauses, subordinate clauses are marked by verbal
morphology. This means that there are no non-verbal subordinate predicates.","[401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408]"
