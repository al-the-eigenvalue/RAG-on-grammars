"In the sixth position, that nearest the stem, we find only three prefixes, for one of which there is only a single example (nat'o'aki, he
arrived). The second, pu-, by sucking, is of limited use, and the third
pi-, near, diminutive activity, one of the most important and extensively used prefixes in Wappo. That pi-, an adverbial element, should
be treated differently from the others seems to imply that it had become
fused at an early time with so many verb-stems that, in spite of the fact
that it became a free prefix, i.e., could be used with any verb, the
position immediately near the stem asserted itself too strongly for it
to be removed to the fourth position occupied by the other adverbial
prefixes. Regarding the important question as to whether we can
always gauge the approximate relative age of a prefix from its proximity
to the stem, our answer must, on the whole, be negative, because it
seems clear, first, that true composita (noun+verb) may arise at any
time and the noun of such composita becomes grouped with sixth
position elements, or such a detached element as, for instance, cumight secondarily be felt as belonging to another group and transferred40University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.","[48, 49]"

one stage of its history], that phonetic traits often belong to languages which are
morphologically entirely distinct .....

It is not so easy to understand the development of similar categories of words

of morphological traits from one language to another [e.g., second third person
in Kutenai and Algonkin].
.... it would be entirely unwarranted to claim that all similarities of phonetics, classification of concepts, or of morphology must be due to borrowing. On
the contrary, their distribution shows that they must be considered as due to
psychological causes such as the unavoidable necessity of classification of experience in speech, which can lead to a limited number of categories only, or the
physiological possibilities of articulation, that also limit the range of possible
sounds which are sufficiently distinct to the ear for clear understanding.
If these observations regarding the influence of acculturation upon language
should be correct, then the whole history of American languages must not be
treated on the assumption that all languages which show similarities must be
considered as branches of the same linguistic family ..... We should have to
reckon with the tendency of languages to absorb so many foreign traits, that we
can no longer speak of a single origin, and that it would be arbitrary whether we
associate a language with one or the other of the contributing stocks.
[In proving relationship of certain languages] The question would remain
to be answered, why there should be such fundamental dissimilarities between by
far the larger number of words [he is speaking of Athabascan, Tlingit, and Haida],
and the question should still be asked how these dissimilarities are to be explained.","[11, 12]"

"1929]Radin: A Graimmar of the Wappo Language5The genetic problem was thus brushed aside by these philologists
as irrelevant and, at best, not of interest. Unfortunately, as new and
more detailed data were obtained and apparent similarities increased,
it assumed an unexpected importance. And here it is, it seems to me,
that the protagonists of the multiple origin theory (expressed or unexpressed) have shown a surprising lack of progressive vision. One might
have expected that the leaders in so revolutionary an implied criticism
of prevalent methods in, comparative philology would have recognized
that a theory like that of multiple origin was of value only in so far as
it explained the facts better than any other. Instead of that, instead
of welcoming the possibility of a new synthesis, they have developed
a new series of highly problematical assumptions like the wholesale
borrowing of morphological traits and a vaguely defined type of acculturation. Now the whole significance of the method of the American
school has lain in its freedom from stereotyped dogmas and it seems
somewhat of a retrograde step for it to cling so tenaciously to an
unproved hypothesis and emphasize purely negative aspects of the
problem.
We indicated before that the American school has not quite realized
how iconoclastic its method really has been and that this ignorance
is to be ascribed to 'its lack of contact with the European philological
method. But this divorce has had other serious consequences. It has
prevented the results obtained from the study of the American languages from making their contribution to the possible solution of the
problems that have for many years puzzled Indo-European scholars,
the case system, the nature of conjugations, numerous syntactical
questions, etc. What is perhaps even more disastrous, the method of
presentation adopted, for instance, in the Handbook of American
Indian Languages, has, on the whole, in its reaction against the Latin
scheme of grammar and in its lack of concern with other types of
presentation, taken on such a form as to make it needlessly difficult.
In the following grammar I shall make an attempt to present the
facts of the Wappo language as I found them in the texts and from
questioning my informants. I shall at the same time bear in mind
continually that Wappo has had a history which is often fairly clearly
disclosed in numerous forms. That interpretations of this kind are
highly subjective I would be one of the first to admit. But the facts
are presented quite apart from any hypothesis and in such a way as

"1929]Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Langusage19§§2-1 1. PHONETICS
§§2-7. PHONETIC ELEMENTS§2. General
The sound-system of Wappo is comparatively simple. The vowels
appear in two series, a short-open (e, L, a, v) and a medium-long-closed
(e, i, o, u, a). Diphthongs are quite common. The stops are well
developed and the spirants moderately so. Whether three series of
stops occur (sonant, surd, glottalized surd) is an open question. Kroeber8
heard them whereas Barrett did not, while I am uncertain although
inclined to agree with Kroeber. To my ear, however, the series seems
to be unaspirated stop, long stop, glottalized stop. There is no question
in my mind that today, when Wappo cannot be said to be spoken by
more than twenty people, certain sounds are tending to be merged
with one another. For instance, the unaspirated is becoming assimilated
to the long stop that, in turn, has become shortened; the glottalized
is becoming confused with the long stop, and the peculiar palatalized t
with the ordinary t.
Accent is exclusively one of stress although there seemed to be a
suggestion of pitch in connection with the future and imperative.
The timbre of vowels is affected by neighboring consonants, and
final vowels quite frequently disappear. Vocalic consonance undoubtedly exists, Wappo differing in this respect from Yuki proper.
No original consonant clusters exist although secondary ones are
very frequent.
All terminal vowels that are not aspirated, i.e., in other words,
the overwhelming majority, are weakly glottalized.","[17, 18]"

§§65-69. FORMATION OF TENSE§65. Introduction
Wappo seems originally to have possessed an indefinite tense, a
future, and two pasts. This gives us then:
Indefinite -i (-a, -e).
Future
Past-si (-.si).-ta, -ki.
A certain significance attaches to this duplication because of the
repeated insistence by my informant upon two forms for each tense,
one used in a general statement, the other in what he called ""answer
to a question,"" i.e., a responsive. Such responsive forms occur in some
American languages (Salish, Central Wintun, Southwestern Pomo) and
have probably been overlooked in others. I suspect that some other
meaning is or was at one time connected with this responsive-namely,
presence and absence. Unfortunately either this responsive is very
irregular and passing out of existence, or my interpreter could not
explain the matter adequately-the fact remains that there were
numerous contradictions. What seems to be reasonably clear is that
-ta was often used as direct-past, -ki responsive-past, -si direct-future.",[104]

connected with durative and semi-passive aspect. The second interpretation is by far the more likely. Whether however we are to regard
these diphthongs as ultimately secondary in origin, i.e., consisting of
stem vowel plus -i durative and -u semi-passive, or simply as vowel
mutations to express aspect, must remain an open question.

has a vague present-momentaneous connotation would naturally have
only one form.
Now the first question that presents itself is this: If the responsive
(or whatever was its former meaning), is an old trait why is it connected with a secondary and late formation of the future -yaomi?
If -yaomi has displaced an older formation is there any trace of it
today? The hortatory -a- immediately occurs to one's mind. Many
things speak in favor of this -a- (really a petrified ablauted terminal
vowel), being an old responsive. First, some responsives are formed
by ablaut and secondly -a- with the meaning of hortatory-subjunctive
impresses one as secondary.
The second point concerns the history of -ta and -ki. -ta is unknown
in Yuki proper. It is common enough in many Indian languages.
-ki appears in Yuki as a present and verbalizer of adjective stems.
This latter function is also characteristic of its force in Wappo. However it is also quite likely that there are two -ki, one a general verbalizer,
the other a past tense."" The Yuki forms for the past are -wi-(-u)
ordinary and -witc (obviously related to -wi), completed past. As two
forms for the future occur, -pa future and -mik immediate futurity
or future intent, one is tempted to equate them with the Wappo responsive formations. However until more information upon Coast
Yuki and Huchnom is forthcoming this would be too hazardous.",[105]
"68[Vol. 27in certain of the tense-aspects. In large measure, however, the original
changes that characterized all but some of the increment forms have
been levelled down. The original, unchanged, and unincremented
form, which apparently expressed single momentaneous activity, has
lost that force and acquired an indefinite significance. The increment
bases, especially those in -te-, 1-, -mak-, -lek-, have become restricted
to the future and past tenses.
A few irregularly distributed survivals of some of the intensive
and diminutive forms occur, giving rise to peculiar forms for the passive,
for the reflexive, for the transitive and intransitive, and even for
certain tenses and modes.
§§48-50. VERBAL TENSE-ASPECT ROOTS§48. Wappo Verb Base from a Phonetic Viewpoint
The Wappo verb base, as we have just seen, is from a phonetic
viewpoint exceedingly variable, a variability due to both phonetic and
morphological causes. In §§51-53 we shall group all the verbs in the
language according to the nature of the differences between the various
tense-aspect stems. Here we wish merely to present them in terms
of the number of roots each verb shows, leaving aside, for the moment,
the question whether they are primary or secondary.
Looked at in this way the verbs fall into three divisions: those that
have but one root, i.e., show no change; those that have two roots;
and those that have three. The first group need not detain us except
to state that it contains, at most, forty percent of the verbs, possibly
really not more than thirty per cent. The mhajority of the verbs belong
to the second and third divisions. As many examples are given in
the section on Types of Stem-Formation, I shall give here only enough
to show the nature of the stem variability. I am not including the
increments -lek- and -mok-.",[77]
"§85. Plural in -le
-le plural has been discussed in part in a number of places. Like
-te it is fused idiomatically with certain stems; with others it is employed
as a future-past increment and nominal (collective) plural (-lu, -lo)
although rarely used as such today. As a functional plural suffix of
verbs it is extensively used in present-day Wappo in contradistinction
to -te. It probably occurs in the texts, too. But there it is so closely
bound up with the whole question of -le passive that the two are difficult to keep apart. I shall therefore give as examples only cases where
the plural force of -1, -4e was definitely insisted upon.
nako'telki, blossoms come out (nakaVteke, responsive plur.; nako'tke, sing.).

"1929]Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language21§15. ClassiJication
As mentioned before verbs use no suffixes or prefixes to indicate
the character of the object, employing for this purpose, whenever they
wish to express it, either distinct stems or, rarely, ablauted forms.
The same holds true for the noun and pronoun except that very
recently, probably, a classification of nouns into human and nonhuman has developed, the former being indicated by k-a-, a variant
form of the word for man, k-eo. A suffix indicating female gender is
found with certain relationship terms.
§16. iAumber
Most verbs do not today, except in the imperative, indicate plurality.
Some do however, either by means of suffixes (-te-, -1-) or by irregular
formations. In the imperative there is a true plural and probably a
dual. There can be no question but that Wappo formerly expressed
plurality in the verb very generally and it is more than probable that
it distinguished between singular and plural subject and object.
All nouns without exception express plurality by the suffix -te,
relationship terms often taking a reduplicated -tE (-tete).
All pronouns express plurality but not by the same suffix as nouns.
The demonstratives indicate both plurality and duality.
A number of verbs, two adjectives, and the relative pronoun indicate plurality by complete change of stem.","[29, 30]"
"[Vol. 27One of the most important features of the spoken language as
known today is its deviation in certain grammatical details and vocabulary from the language of the texts, at least from that in which all the
myths told by Tripo were couched. My interpreter always referred
to this as the ""high language"" and experienced occasionally some
difficulty in understanding a few of the forms. It is difficult to state
definitely exactly in what the difference lies. This much is clear, however, that in the question of verb irregularities the spoken and written
language are at one. Certain suffixes like the aspects -cele, -mEle, -sElE,
-kElE, the inferential (?) -k-, vowel mutation for subjunctive, etc., are
rarely used in the spoken language, or if used, only with the vaguest
of meanings. On the other hand a number of suffixes with subjunctive
force, rarely if ever encountered with this signification in the texts
(-lEk-, -te-, -ta-, -la-) are widely employed in the present-day conversational speech.
The grammar that follows is based largely on the texts of two individuals, Jim Tripo and Joe McCloud, both men over sixty who spoke
Wappo perfectly. The former, now deceased, had spent many years
of his life among the Eastern Pomo and spoke that language quite
fluently; the latter claimed at one time to have known Spanish better
than Wappo; and there is a possibility that the tales of Spanish origin
dictated by him have been influenced by Spanish idioms.
The texts have been published as ""Wappo Texts"" in volume 19
of this series, in 1924.
A11 the texts obtained were translated by McCloud. He is also
responsible for all the grammatical forms obtained in connection with
them.",[17]

"[Vol. 27§53. Types of Stem-Formation
Of these seventeen types the first, the regular, is most frequent.
Types 2, 3, 4 are, on the whole, rare; 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 fairly common;
10, 11, 14 extremely rare; and 15, 16, 17 not common.
How these types arose is fairly clear. The loss of vowel and mutation of vowel in the indefinite is due to the morphological significance
of the suffixes of the indefinite, all of which refer to durative and
progressive aspect. This has caused, on the one hand, the terminal
stem vowel to change into durative -i and, on the other, the elision of
old causative -a as redundant. That, in origin, the vocalic mutation
was due to phonetic, specifically accentual conditions is quite plausible,
even probable, but this vocalic instability was perpetuated and then
extended because it had secondarily become associated with a specific
morphological significance. Similarly, vocalic elision in the indefinite
may have been caused originally by the influence of accent, or better,
the preservation of the vowel in increment forms may be due to shift
of accent. Its subsequent extension was due to the realization of the
force of the indefinite suffix as progressive, durative, etc., so that the
causative -a- was felt as redundant. The future and preterit suffixes
referring only to tense proper are associated with no phonetic changes
except an occasional loss of reduced -e- or -&- for the past. It is true
that the preterit in -ki does, at times, round the preceding vowel, but
this is due to the fact that it has become confused with the passive
-ki which fairly regularly changes a terminal stem vowel to -o, -u, -a.
The second type of change, the insertion of increments in the future
and preterit, and more irregularly in the imperative, is entirely morphological in origin. The only question to be answered here is why the
indefinite stem does not possess them. Again this may possibly be
explained by the influence of the suffixes of that tense-aspect, for these
have essentially the same force as many of the increments. That at
bottom it is the suffix that has been the obstacle to the extension of
increments to the indefinite is proved by the fact that the moment
these suffixes are omitted these increments can be and are employed.
Indeed we may assume that in an older phase of the language, before
the fusion of the indefinite stem with so many aspect suffixes, the
indefinite (probably a true present tense at that time), did actually
possess the increments -te-, -1-, and possibly -mv-, for a fairly large
number of verbs contain a petrified -t- and -1- that is certainly identical
with increments -te- and -1-. It is a notable fact that the vast majority
of these verbs do not take the aspect suffixes (-mi, -se, -cc, -ya) in the
indefinite but use the vowels (-i, -e, -a) instead.",[81]
"1929]Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language135However as the objective personal pronominal forms are also used
as the possessive the foregoing usage has become merged in an idiomatic
construction which consists in employing the possessive forms in indirect
discourse and other subordinate sentences. In origin this is simply the
persistence of the use of the objective form as the subject of the verb
in subordinate clauses, mentioned above. The Yuki idiom of putting
the object of certain transitive verbs in the possessive is clearly identical.48 There, however, the possessive suffix appears with the pronoun,
which is not the case in Wappo.
The question of the relation of the Yukian pronominal system is
too large to enter upon here. It shows marked affinities with the
Hokan series in spite of considerable divergence of detail.
§101. Possessive PronounThe regular possessive pronoun is simply the objective series of
the personal pronoun with a few changes. It appears however in two
forms, one with and one without the possessive suffix -me, the first
used with relationship terms and body-part nouns to indicate inalienable possession and the second with all other nouns to indicate alienable
possession. The second series can however be employed with body-part
nouns when they specifically express separation from the body.
The main difference between the personal and the possessive series
is the use of the old form mesa for the third plural, and the dual ka,
ku with all the plural forms, although tse'kato is also found. The series
follows:

clearly bound up with the whole question of the nature of the final
vowel of the indefinite, possibly being either the terminal vowel of the
stem of a tense-aspect suffix or both, that no importance need be
attached to this apparent triple change. The type of change met with
in verbs possessing two roots is quite different, as we shall see.

"1929]19adin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language5144. -ma, -mO, progressive imperative. Generally used with verbs
of the ""progressive conjugation"" but also sporadically.
mema'nu-ma, pick it up!; mey'ka-ma, fly up!; hole'u-ma, run!; le'pu-ma,
stand!; meka'lu-ma, pick up!; meka't'u-ma, pick up!; napico'la-ma, whisper!;
tc-awa'lu-ma, dodge!; pu'lu-ma, run away!; mat'u'yo-ma, have in hand!45. -me, permissive imperative. This is possibly but not very likely
related to -mi of plural imperatives.
ts'e'ya-me, well stop!; k*u'e-me, well run!; pa""-me, well eat!; uk'k'i-me, well
drink!; hLntco'el-me, well dream!; yo'k't-me, well stay!46. -kumi, (dual? or) plural imperative. That -mi is plural seems
clear, but the exact force of -ku- is not at all evident. It may be the
dual -ku- or it may be the aspect suffix -kv- found in -kele. The texts
give no definite clue. The first explanation is the more likely. There
is, however, always the possibility open that the -ku- of -kumi is not
identical with -ke- of -kele.
pa""elak-kumi, don't eat them!; le'ula-kumi, go (dual) and get her!; pe'hela-kumi, leave them alone!
47. -lumi, imperative plural. There seems to be no reason for
doubting that -lu- is in origin the continuative-plural. Although -lumi
is now used with many verbs that have no -1- increment in the future
and past, there is little question but that this more general employment is a secondary development and that originally it was only found
with such increment forms. Some of the examples in the text suggest
that -lumi either implies a plural subject or a plural subject and plural
object. A differentiation of such a nature is a striking feature of
Southwestern Pomo.
In general it may be said that imperative singulars in -e' take -lumi.
tewe'la-lumi, come back!; tse-'i-lumi, stop!; tc-amewi""l-lumi, tell me!;
matco'e-lumi, come!; hel tetie'-lumi, bring light!; hawe'-lumi, stay here!; tai'ttlumi, sing!; pa""e-lume, eat!; k""ue-lume, run!; u'k't-lume, drink!48. -tumi, imperative plural. -tumi may be analyzed as being in
origin either increment -te- and imperative -mi or imperative singular
-ti- and -mi. The former is by far the more likely for a number of
reasons and -tumi may thus be considered as a formation analogous to
-lumi. It is far more general than the latter, a development that was
clearly hastened by the influence of the singular -ti. As in the case of
-lumi the texts seem to indicate that -tumi implies singular ubjects
and plural object.","[59, 60]"
"The t-a forms are not found in the texts often and the -a- subjunctive is on the whole not frequent. It would seem as if the subjunctive
is indicated not so much by change of terminal vowel to -a as by an
irregular vocalic mutation. Cf. discussion §72.
9. Expanded or increment bases.-To the numerous changes in the
nature of the base wrought by vocalic and consonantal ablaut we must
add those transformations caused by the fusion of suffixes with the
original verb-stem. As we have pointed out before these suffixes belong
to distinct strata in the language. Some must have lost whatever
meaning they possessed at an early period, others are only half understood and half functional today, while others are frequently used. As1929]Badin: A G-rammar of the Wappo Language67in very many instances these formatives are so firmly fused with the
stem that it is quite artificial to separate them, and as they have had,
after all, a long independent history, we shall treat the forms possessing them as definite bases and call them expanded and increment
forms.
Some of the suffix-formatives are fairly clear, e.g., -te-, -ta-, -1, -c-,
-s-; others moderately felt like -hv, -wv, -yv, etc., while a long series,
the petrified suffixes, are quite vague. Examples will be found in the
section on verbal suffixes (§34-64). Here only a few instances will
be given:
tsa'i-, tip over, tsul, tsel, turn over; kas, ka'tt, wear, wear around neck; tcoc,tcohi, tca'yi, put; tc'a'tc', tcu-su'p, tc*ul, tc'ap-, ts'up-, take or related meanings.
The reason for the disappearance of the older method of forming
aspects by vocalic and consonantal ablaut is to be ascribed to the
development of a large number of suffixes with aspect significance, to
the marked extension of such suffixes as the iterative and the continuative, and lastly, to the spread of the concept of tense. There
seems little question that such suffixes as -sv, -cV, -mi, -ki did not
originally have a predominatingly aspect connotation. The first three
were probably plurals and the last simply the past tense. What seems
to have taken place is the gradual transference to them of meanings
inherent in the vowel of the base. In some cases, as in a number of
indefinites in -sv, -or, the old ablauted vowel was preserved. Generally
it was lost. Perhaps the present development of the passive illustrates
exactly what occurred. Although -u- is beyond the shadow of a doubt
the sign of the passive and -ki merely the tense suffix, the idea of the
passive is being transferred to -ki to such an extent that passives are
now being formed without -u-.
It is just conceivable that some of the old ablauted bases have been
preserved in the vowels of the indefinite suffixes for we have the series,
-mi, -me-, -ma; -se, -si, -sa; -ce, -ci, -ca, and -i, -a, -e.","[75, 76]"
"§76. Formation of the Responsive
It is possible that the data obtained on this subject are not conclusive. The forms obtained suggest great irregularity.
nako'teke, they bloomed (responsive); nako'telki, they bloomed (direct).
?mecu'teki, he grabbed (resp.); mecu'telke, he grabbed (ditiect).
hote'peki, long objects lie (resp.); hote'pelki, long objects lie (direct); ote'puke,
long objects lie (direct).
nata'meki, they lie on stomach (resp.); nata'melki, they lie on stomach
(direct).
cuttne'ki, they stoop (resp.); cutrne'lki, they stoop (direct).
su'teki, they stoop (resp.); su'tLlki, they stoop (direct).§77. -mele, -cele, -sele, -kele
Few elements in Wappo are more difficult to ex'plain than these
very extensively used suffixes. That they are to be analyzed into
-mCe-, -ce-le, -se-le, -ke-le seems rather obvious. The first part of -cele
and -sele we can then equate with usitative and durative -c-, -s-. But
it is just here that our real difficulties begin. The usitative and durative
can be said to appear in two forms, as simple usitative and durative
infix -c-, -s- and as usitative and durative tense-aspect suffix -cv and
-sv. The first is historically much older than the second for Yuki
proper possesses the first but not the second, thus indicating that it is
secondary in Wappo. Since Yuki proper likewise has close parallels
to all four of our suffixes (-mil, -sil, -cil, -kil) we are quite justified in
regarding Wappo -mele, etc., as belonging to the same period as -cand -s-. That has a very important corollary for it allows us definitely
to exclude any possibility of -mele having arisen from -mi, or -me
indefinite tense, or that -kele has arisen from -ki past tense. Indeed
Yuki proper effectually disposes of any idea that -mi and -ki tense1929]1adin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language113suffixes have anything to do with the -me- and -ke- of -mele, -kdle,
for there the corresponding Yukian forms actually follow each other
and are recognized as such:
pimilmil, he played the flute (the first mil is Wappo -mele, the second Wappo-mi); a-p cu'kik, I seat myself (the first k is Wappo -kc(kel), the second Wappo -ki).
In Wappo the situation is not so clear for no such form as -melemdle
or -meme exist. -keke (-keki) is occasionally found in the texts although
these forms always puzzled my interpreter. In addition to -mil, -sil,
-kil Yuki proper has -til and -lil. The first occurs sporadically in Wappo
in the texts as -tel, the second is non-existent. -tel, -tele, and -4ele do
occur but in all cases they can be shown to consist of verb-stems ending
in -teand -le respectively to which -le is suffixed.
Now with regard to the terminal -le, Yuki has a strictly comparable
-il for which however Kroeber39 could find no meaning. For Wappo
we certainly can remedy this defect for there it is manifestly the continuative and the plural (leaving aside for the time the question whether
the two are identical). In Wappo, however, we saw that -le in -mele,
-cele, -sele, -kele possesses a passive and semi-passive significance, a fact
that seemed to be borne out fairly convincingly by certain forms in
-la. Here Yuki proper helps us out considerably for there we find -lil
with a reflexive and reciprocal meaning. As we can analyze -lil into
-1- and -il it must evidently be the first that contains the reflexivereciprocal significance. This evidence consequently goes far toward
justifying the view that the -le of Wappo -mele, -cele, -sele, -kele has
nothing to do with the passive and that this passive type is to be
regarded as a transitive verb with plural subject. For further discussion
of passive -la, -le, cf. §39. Now, of the four forms, it is only -mele that
was extensively used as passive and if we look around in Yuki proper
for a suffix with which this -mele might be connected, we find one that
seems to fit our case, namely -mi defined by Kroeber as indicating
involuntary, inanimate actions and automatic motions, etc. Surely the
idea of indefinite subject might be added.
A tabular presentation of the Yuki and Wappo forms will perhaps
make the above-remarks clearer:
Yuki
-kil repeated action limited to single period.
-til causative, transitive.
-sil general idea of motion.
-lil reflexive or reciprocal.
-mil meaning unknown.
39 This series, 9:359-360.-k unrepeated, instantaneous action.
-1 intransitive, unintentional.
-is continuative, iterative.
-m involuntary, inanimate actions.","[121, 122]"
"[Vol. 2772. -1e, continuative-plural. Identical with -4 but probably belonging
to a different period of the language.
nats'e'ye-le, they eat it up; nats'a'-le, to chew; ts'u'te-le, they skinned; ma'tcule'le, turning over; k'a'ne-le, packing; ts'u'pc-le, to take in snare; tucu'yo-le,
throwing it; tca'se-le, loving.73. -s-, usitative-durative. One of the most frequent suffixes in
the language and one that appears idiomatically fused to the verb-stem
in numerous instances. The indefinites in -sv are special developments
of it. It is rarely used, or perhaps better, rarely recognized in the
indefinite and future. In the latter tense it would, of course, become
assimilated with the -si of the future.
mana'o-s-ta, he showed him (na'o, to see); hatt'-s-ki, she knows (ha'ta, to
know); oma'nt-s-ki, he held (ma'ni, to hold); la'm-s-ki, he carried flat object
(lom, to carry); kate'-s-ki, he carried long object (ka'tt, to carry); na'mt-s-ki,
they lived (no'mi, to live); ots&'tst-s-ta, he boiled it (tsi'tsi, to boil); tema'u'kt-s-ta,
he gave her to drink; no'kt-s-ta, they made friends (nak, friend).74. -c-, durative-inchoative. Whether this is a variant of -s- or
vice versa is an open question. That it is identical with indefinites
and inchoatives in -cv is manifest. Like -s- it is found idiomatically
fused to verb-stems, although not so frequently.
na'm&-c-ki, they made a home (cf. no'mt-s-ki, they lived); tsutsu'-tc-ki, he
became a dog, mett'c-tc-ki, he held on tight, co't-c-ki, it got hot.
e'la-cv, to get deep; ant'-cv, to be human; owI'-c, to put acorns in receptacle.75. -ke, -k-, meaning unknown. This suffix is found only in texts
and not only was its meaning quite unknown to my main informant,
but he often regarded such forms as incorrect. It is possibly identical
with petrified -k and with Yuki -ak which means a single activity.
Occasionally it is found idiomatically fused with certain verb-stems.
tc-aka'luma-ke'-ke, they took her out; ma'uku'yv-k-ti, they ran after him;hrntco""a-k-ta, he dreamt; lal-k-me, to die; hopatc*a'kekL-si, will leave one another; ko'totu' oka'l-ke-te, they told one another (dual); weta'le-k-ti, they dropped;
tsele'-k-teki, he stayed behind; mesa tenat'a'a-ku-kwen, when they got there;
kuku'i-k-tesi, he will burap head; mata'mo-k-me, to fall on stomach; wi'-k-teki,
to grab a person, they hung on; hona'nv-k-tesi, he will open (crack open); nuke'uk-ti, they all fell in.76. -kv-, inferential. This is apparently never found alone but
always in composition with other elements. Cf. -uktsi, -l-k, -ma-k.
77. -we, meaning unknown. It is possibly a variant of -e-, -e- found
as sign of plurality of some verbs. Only a few instances were obtained,
one of which however occurs frequently.
husi'-we, they speak; pela'-we, look!; ika'mti-we, do something.",[65]
"§71. Formation of the Imperative Plural
There are two primary suffixes indicating the imperative plural,
-lumi and -tumi. To these must be added -kumi probably dual in
significance, -tdlumi and -ktlumi.
That -1(u)- and -t(u)- are variants of -4e- and -te-, the continuative
and distributive affixes, is quite clear. Under no conditions, however,
are they to be regarded as variants of -le and -te- when used as increments of certain verbs. These plural imperatives have developed quite
independently. The -mi is far more puzzling and is to be taken either
as the personal pronoun second singular or as an old imperative suffix
that survives in supplicative-imperative -me. I personally incline to
the second belief. -tdlumi' represents probably the increment -te- and
-lumi the corresponding -lelumi, both having contracted respectively
to -lumi and -tumi. -kLlumi is not at all clear but possibly represents
the increment -k- and -lumi'. No consistent difference in meaning
could be obtained for -lumi', -tumi', -tLlumi', -kdlumi', and there is
only partial justification for crediting -kumi' with a dual force. For
examples cf. §38.
§72. Formation of the Subjunctive
What has the force of a true subjunctive is formed by the affixation
directly to the future base, of three suffixes -tasi, -tesi, and -leksi, the
first having an indefinite present force, the second something of the
value of the imperfect, and the third that of an aorist with indefinite
plural subject. To these must be added the suffix -uk&si with the value
of a passive subjunctive and lastly, an apparent mutation of the
terminal stem-vowel.
Up to the present no examples of -tasi, -tesi, and -leksi with the
values assigned to them here have been found in the texts, but this1929]19adisn: A Grammar of the Wappo Language107function was so consistently and repeatedly assigned to them while
obtaining the ""principal parts"" of the verbs that I see no reason whatsoever for questioning it. The very fact that only a limited number
of verbs were credited with possessing, now one, now all of these three
forms, should go far toward proving them to be authentic.
Terminal stem-vowel mutation is, on the contrary, abundantly
illustrated in the texts, although one is often left in doubt whether to
consider this vowel change as connected with the subjunctive proper
or with general subordination.
Subjunctives in -lEksi, -tesi, -tasi.-In spite of their number I append
all the forms obtained.

"1929]1Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language4722. -ce, -ci, indefinite tense; 23. tv, usitative-durative. -cv usitative-durative is clearly related to -sv (-s) and what exactly constitutes
the difference it is extremely difficult to say. The examples seem to
indicate that -cv implies continuous durative activity whereas -sv
implies iteration more than duration.

stinks (ku""ki, past); ku'la-ca, it smells; (ku'laki, past); ka'li-ca, it aches (ka'lLc-ki,
past).","[55, 56]"
"1929]Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language971. Vowel theme8.-Indefinites in vowel theme (-i, -a, -e) present
considerable difficulty. The vowel is clearly not a tense formative but
part of the stem. On the other hand it is obviously not the original
vowel. As practically all verbs in -i (-si, -mi) are transitive-active,
those in -a (-sa), causative, and those in -e (-se, -cc), intransitive-neuter,
we may confidently assume that these vowels are essentially modalaspect formatives. Indefinites in -a and -e are rare, the vast majority
ending in -i. Why, it may therefore be asked, has -i been preserved
and -a, -e lost? The answer is comparatively simple. -i was preserved
because it contained' a vowel that contrasted with the regular imperative stem -e.
It is extremely important to remember that the vowels of the
suffixes (-mi, -si, -Se, -sa -ce, -ci) are identical with the -i, -a, -e indefinites and that the terminal vowel of stems taking -mi, -sV, -cv, -ya
undergo fairly extensive changes.
Examples will be found in §53. Only a few will be given here.
k-u'yi, he puts on; mali'hi, he pokes; maka'li, he roasts in oven; ma'me, he
gambles; hopats-e'li, he turns around; mewa'ya, he musses it up; nu'he, he is
jealous; nu'he, he robs (intransitive); pek-a'ohe, he slips.2. -mi, -me.-It is probably cognate with Yuki -am, -yam implying
continuative habitual activity and consequently being merely a variant
of collective -am. It might also possibly be equated with -mi of Wappo
plural imperatives. -melc passive contains this same suffix.
In the overwhelming majority of cases -mi occurs only with transitive verbs, but the idea of transitiveness is contained in the -i not in
the -m-. The variant -me is extremely rare and is suffixed to the intransitive. -mv frequently rounds the vowel preceding it. Not infrequently it occurs with a syncopated base. For examples cf. §53.
S.-si, -sa, -se.-This is to be analyzed into -s- durative and -i,'-a,
-e transitive, causative-transitive, and intransitive respectively. -sv has
no influence upon preceding vowel, but owing to its durative force it
is at times found with durative and with syncopated base. Examples
will be found in §53. The contrast in force of -si, -sa, -se is seen in the
following forms:
cuka'lt-si, he drags it; e'lu-sa, he keeps hold of it; omv'ki-se, he lies.4. -c, -ca, -ce.-Here we have formations analogous to the preceding, -v- being the usitative-durative followed by modal-aspect -i, -a,
-e. Both -ci and -ca have however developed. the secondary meaning
of ""become"" and in the large majority of the cases appear with that
meaning. Cf. examples §53.
omik e'uci, it becomes daylight; amisa'mci, it becomes evening; amal-utcuwa-ca,
it becomes dark; e'la-ca, it gets deep.","[105, 106]"
"How to explain the force of these three suffixes is not very easy.
-leksi and -tesi are formally identical with the increment futures.
Are we to regard the subjunctive significance as a secondary development from simple increment futures or, on the contrary, to interpret
the subjunctive force as original? Certain facts point toward the first
alternative, others toward the latter. -lek, for instance, resolves itself
readily into -4e- continuative-increment and -k inferential, thus pointing
to a subjunctive-inferential meaning as original. -tesi, on the other108University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.","[116, 117]"

192[viii]A GRAMMAR OF THE WAPPO LANGUAGE*
BYPAUL RADININTRODUCTIONThe languages of the American Indians have been studied for so
long from one definite viewpoint in America that a few words of
justification must preface any attempt, such as the following, that
deviates in many respects from the customary method. About the
merits of the approach of Boas, Goddard, Michelson, etc., no words
are necessary. To seek to describe a language in terms of its specific
structure with complete disregard, for the time being, of all historical
and genetic problems is a necessary preliminary condition for any
adequate linguistic study. No penetration into the genius of a language
is possible without it, and certainly one of the most justifiable criticisms
that can be leveled against the studies on primitive linguistics made by
many philologists and ethnologists is that they have neglected this
type of presentation and permitted themselves to be completely dominated by purely genetic problems. Quite a number of philologists
(when discussing primitive languages) have been content to accept as
completely adequate and as definitely proved that particular method
of approach which under the name of the ""Jung-Grammatiker"" has
dominated linguistic research in Indo-European and Semitic languages for almost two generations. We do not wish seriously to
criticize this method, but we must regard it as a somewhat unnecessarily non-critical attitude to assume that a method, developed in
connection with a group of special languages, has, of necessity, a universal validity. The leaders of the movement, Brugmann and Delbriick,
made no such claims. All the value that might have accrued to the
general study of linguistics from an unbiased consideration of such
* In
justice to the author it should be recorded that this monograph was
completed by him in June, 1922. It was submitted to the University Editorial
Committee for preliminary inspection in 1923, and on their advice abridged by
omission of an English-Wappo vocabulary and other passages, and further condensed through conversion of many tabular lists of examples into solid text paragraphs, in order to reduce cost of publication. This necessitated recopying; the
author lived abroad for a number of years; and it was not until 1928 that it was
possible, through the aid of the Committee on Research in Indian Languages,
Franz Boas chairman, to have a final typescript copy made and verified by the

"1929]Bad-in: A Grammar of the Wappo Language49In the following instances it is the regular future:
ota'tsilek-ya'omi, he will slap; otst'p-yaomi, he will paint red; ca'tt-yaomi,
it will be bitter; he'lLc-yaomi, it will steam; ko""-yaomi, it will boil.32. -kyaomi, -lyaomi, mokyaomi, -lekyaomi, periphrastic futures.
They are used exactly as the corresponding forms in -si.
33. -ta, indefinite past tense. It is used with all transitive verbs.
a's--ta, he gave; e'l-ta, he kept hold of; i'l-ta, he bound; o'ti-ta, he sucked.34. -sta, -kta, -lekta, -Ita, -makta, indefinite past time. They are
used exactly as the corresponding forms for the future.
35. -ki, probably indefinite past time. -ki probably refers to a
single past action. It is regularly used with certain verbs instead of -ta.
Whether it is identical with -kv passive it is difficult to say. In all
probability it was originally used without any specific temporal force
and became specifically associated with intransitive, neuter, and passive
verbs (cf. §§74-80). Also used to form verbs from adjectives.
i'u-ki, he moved; amiho'kewt-ki, it becomes daylight (indefinite and past);
3'tewL-ki, he was dead; o'ka-ki, he answered; oli'tca-ki, he was full; ome*'i-ki, it
was wet; omoti'-a-ke, it overflowed; omv'ka-ki, he lay (down); opi'tct-ki, it broke.36. -cki, -ski, -teki, -steki, -Iki, past tense. These are used like the
corresponding future forms except that the increment -te- always takes
-ki and never -ta so that some transitive verbs are found with -teki.

petrified causative suffix. Where however -a occurs alone (oli'ts-a,

may hold in the case of ma-pe'k-a, where -pa- is foot, -k petrified suffix,
and -a petrified causative, but not for many others. The -a of oli'ts-a,
hoka'm-a, is consequently to be regarded as original.
Related forms like honi'-e-l and mani'-a indicate how easily -a lost

peculiarities of the language.

There can be no question but that the future in many of these cases
contains the true, and the indefinite contains the mutated stem. This
is shown by the unanimity with which the past agrees with the future.
On the other hand phonetic considerations have, at times, led to secondary changes in the latter so that it can be said that this stem too
does not correspond to the true root. Indefinites in -ca, for instanep,
seem to preserve original -a, the vowel of the future in these cases
being reduced as in regular stems. Similarly the -i of u'tsitsi is original
(u'tci, night). The original vowel of monosyllabic stems (a')ti, o'ta,
(te)la', (te)la' is probably preserved in neither form. Such variations
as u'tu, u'tai, (te)la', (te)la', and probably o'tti, o'tta, (ma)a'pa, (ma)a'pa1929]Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language79are all mutations of original vowel to indicate aspect, which have been
secondarily preserved in the future.
Practically every vowel is found in the indefinite forms (a, e, i, a, u)
and only two in the futures (a, l). This greater variability of the indefinites we have seen is due to the preservation of original -a and original
-e. The -u in ts'i'l-u-ce he'w-u-se is passive, and -i is the intransitive
and durative formative.

For the most part it can be assumed that this -hv- is identical with
petrified causative -a. The meaning of the verbs and the occurrence of
the same stem, without -hv, seems to bear this out. This will not,
however, account for all cases. For instance, ha'he I prefer to regard
as reduplication and in (hu)na'he- it is actually the stem itself that is
elided, *he being the root of the verb ""to carry."" -hv- seems to have
been retained in a number of verbs, e.g.:
(tu)ke.'hi, he rakes; nu'he, he is jealous; (me)ne'he, he takes food out of
ground; (ma)tca'ht-mi, he puts down; (ma)li'hi, he pokes; lu'hi, he plucks off;

"[Vol. 27to it. It would, I feel quite confident, be exceedingly safe to consider
all the third and fourth position prefixes as of the same age. On the
other hand, the very fact that adverbial elements are placed in one
group, instrumentals in another, and that detached portions of composita can be regrouped all this speaks for a considerable age for
prefixation.
§§34-64. SUFFIXATION IN THE VERB§34. Introduction
Suffixation is clearly an old process in Wappo, and one that is still
in full force. The firmness with which the vast majority of the suffixes
are fused to the verb-stem is the most convincing proof of their age,
and the ease with which independent verbs can be reduced first to
postpositions and then to semi-suffixes is the best evidence of the
continuous vigor of the process itself. Perhaps another indication is
to be found in the fact that barely more than a half-dozen of the suffixes
can be derived from any known independent stem.
As far as degree of fusion with the verb-stem is concerned, it can
hardly be said that there is any noticeable difference in the suffixes
until we come to those connected with the periphrastic tenses and
those serving as subordinating conjunctions. In these cases the fusion
with the verb-stem is weak, and this is correlated with the fact that
they are all palpably fairly recent developments. They are indeed all
either old independent verbs (ya, mi, mak, mesi) or adverbs (tsel, wen,
tu, tseta).
In the case of the verbal prefixes we pointed out that while a few
were found employed as nominal suffixes, the vast majority are now
used only with verbs. For the suffixes this does not hold true. Leaving
aside the petrified elements and those referring to tense, we find among
the nominal affixes a large number identical with those of the verbs
and possessing the same meaning, at the same time having such marked
similarity in form as to suggest definite relationship. How we are to
interpret this is not easy to decide. Yet it appears to be but one of a
number of features all pointing in the same direction, namely toward a
marked nominalization of the verb. We noted it previously in the case
of such pronominal possessive prefixes as te-, me-, mai-. We find it
again in the r6le played by iterative -te, continuative -1, usitative -s-,
plural -mv, and the various instrumental suffixes -i, -noma, -ma, -ka.
Now when we compare -te, -1, and -s- with nominal -ti plural, -lu
collective plural, -si, demonstrative and numeral plural, and with the
nominal plural -ma -(Yuki), there seems little question but that they19291Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language41are identical and that their use in verbs is secondary. This very same
feature is one of the characteristics of Hokan as shown by Pomo,
Washo, Salinan, and to a more limited extent Achomawi. It is this
same tendency which has led to the loss of the vowels of the tense
suffixes -ki, -ce, -se before the subordinating suffixes -tsel and -wen,
thus converting them into absolute forms of the verb and merging them
into nominal constructions comparable to the noun formatives -k, -s, -c.
Just as the prefixes and suffixes differ in regard to the degree of
their specific association with the verb so they differ in regard to their
origin. That of the prefixes is manifest. They are practically all either
nouns, adverbs, demonstratives, or verbs. The origin of the suffixes
is not so evident; but one thing is clear, namely that the majority of
them have been functioning for an extremely long time as suffixes
only. We might thus quite justifiably claim that the prefixes plus verb
represent a type of stem composition and that the suffixes plus verb
do not.
There are, however, a few suffixes that definitely do represent such
a type of stem-composition. They are all connected with the periphrastic constructions and with the causatives. Two old verbs meaning
to go, to move, both sparingly used now, mv and ya, are employed for
the periphrastic. What interests us in both verbs is that each has apparently been called into service a number of times. We have, for instance,
an indefinite in -ya representing a specialization of the original verb to
go, that certainly antedates considerably the development of -yao and
-yaomi into a future; and we have an indefinite in -mi that must very
considerably antedate -ma and -mak. Indeed it is extremely doubtful
whether -ma and -mak belong to the same stratum and whether -ma
is not really a very old suffix meaning ""motion toward,"" also found in
Yuki, and -mak simply a recent development from makce, to move.
In that case -ma would be even older than -mi. The importance of
this frequent selection of two words, both referring to movement, lies
in the fact that it suggests a considerable age for this tendency toward
periphrastic constructions. This is of double significance for the history
of Wappo since it connects it even more definitely with the Hokan
groups where such constructions are old and frequent, and it explains
the irregularities in the indefinite tense. These are clearly due to the
fact that the various indefinites were in origin periphrastic constructions that have largely lost their original force.
For the causatives likewise we must assume a varied history and
perhaps the employment, at distinctly separated periods, of the same
verb to do, to make, since the causatives -si, -mesi, and -tasi are related.","[49, 50]"
"§107. The Negative
This is regularly formed by the postposition of la'ki, which is
composed of la, not, and a suffix of unknown force which also appears
with kaki, cannot. la'ki has the same effect upon the preceding verbstem as the subordinating suffixes -tsel, -kwen and frequently causes
them to lose the vowel of their tense-aspect suffixes. This fact, taken
together with other indications, suggests that -ki is the general verbalizer.
la has been secondarily specialized into a suffix or postposition
with the meaning of ""without."" For examples cf. §93.
§108. ConnectivesWappo has a fairly large, number of connectives indicating rather
fine shades of relationship of the different parts of the sentence to each
other. The most important connectives are the demonstrative-possessives -te and me, the equivalents of Latin eius and suus. This same
function is expressed in Yuki proper by si and sa .49
The most important connectives are the following:
ma""a, and, then (does not begin a sentence); pa't-a, then (with correlative
force; begins many sentences); yo, Latin-que; tse, tse'o, tse'ti, tse'ma, tse'ta,

tu, because.",[148]

-i being set off against the imperative -e, -a against -i, loss of vowel

§§45-47. GENERAL MORPHOLOGY OF VERB§45. Introduction
The Wappo verb presents an unusual amount of difficulty. Often
it is quite impossible to determine where the stem ends and where
formatives and affixes begin, and frequently enough when the stem is
clearly differentiated, its exact form remains uncertain by reason of
consonant and vowel changes to which it is subjected. We have consequently a double task, first the precise determination, as far as that is
possible, of the verb-stem, and secondly, an orderly presentation of the
various irregularities that have arisen.
After all functional and petrified suffixes and prefixes have been
accounted for, the verb-stem appears in a form that is assuredly not
original and yet defies further analysis. Stems of the type c+v+c
approximate perhaps most closely to their original form, although here
too an old terminal vowel may have been lost. The normal stems
(c+v+c+v, v+c+v) have terminal vowels that are, in many cases,
secondary. However the primary task is to decide which of the primary
verb bases reflects the original quality of this vowel most accurately.
On the whole it is best preserved in those futures that have not reduced
all terminal vowels to secondary -v-. It is also found in the indefinite,
past, and imperative. Yet it seems doubtful whether, all in all, one
can be reasonably certain of more than thirty per cent of the cases.
The nature of the terminal vowel must therefore be left undetermined.
Similarly in monosyllabic stems of the form c+v and c+v+c, where
in obviously related verbs the vowel and occasionally the initial consonant varies, the true nature of the stem must also be left undetermined
except that we may feel certain that the glottalized consonant and -iand -u- are likely to be non-original. Pedantic as it may seem, if we
wish to have regard for their historically older forms, all we have a
right to predicate is the following: base with variable consonant+variable vowel, c+variable vowel+c, c+v+c+ variable vowel. Probably
when we know more about the other Yukian dialects and the other
American Indian languages, particularly Penutian and Hokan, this
may be remedied.",[69]
"[Vol. 27fact that the main accent is almost always on the verb-stem. There is
one point, however, in this connection, of extreme importance. The
vowels of the prefixes me- (local), tc*a- and, to a lesser extent, pa-, te(local), ho- (local) and na- (local), vary considerably. We find, for
instance, me-, ma-, mo-, ma-, mu-, me-; tc-a-, tc-o-, tc u-, tc e-; pa-,
pa-; te-, to-, tu-; ho-, hu-, ha-; na-, no-; and, at times, such forms as
ha'a-, ma'a-, ta',-, na'a-. As we know that many Wappo verbs began
with initial vowel, it would be most natural to interpret most of these
mutations as due to the influence of this vowel, now lost in numerous
cases. Such an interpretation would not, however, explain why piand na- (mouth) are not affected and why the prefixes show such marked
differences in the nature of their vowel changes. Clearly a supplementary hypothesis must be added, and to me the most likely one and that
suggested by certain semantic differentiations is that, in some instances,
phonetically identical prefixes are quite unrelated, and that in other
cases, we are dealing with slight shades of meaning indicated by vowelablaut. That there are a number of utterly unrelated ma- (local) and
te- (local) prefixes we know, and that me-, me- (with the hand), possibly pa-, pa- (together), represent slight changes in meaning, is extremely likely. Whether, however, the whole range tca-, tc-o-, tc u-,
tc e-, for instance, implies four gradations in significance is, nevertheless,
quite unlikely.
In short it seems extremely likely that the three factors mentioned
above have all been operative in the development of the vowel ablaut
of prefixes, although owing to confusion of homonyms with each other
and the influence of analogy it is well-nigh impossible, in many instances, to determine which of the three has been operative in any
given case. I am inclined to believe that phonetically irregular fusion
of prefix with initial stem-vowel has been the most, and semantic vowel
mutation the least, frequent cause for the mutation.
As we might expect, a definite order is observable in the position
of the prefixes to which there is no exception. This order is of considerable significance for the history of prefixation in Wappo in that it
suggests that the nearer we approach to the verb-stem the older the
particular prefix is likely to be. It is moreover of some value in the
interpretation of certain prefixes whose meaning and force is vague.
For instance te-, often used with the imperative, loses a good deal of
its uncertainty in meaning when it can be shown to occupy the same
position as the pronominal elements, for then its explanation as a
specialized aspect of te- (Latin eius) seems fairly well fixed. Similarly
whatever doubts may have existed as to the age of na- (with the1929]Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language29mouth), is dissipated when it is seen that it belongs to the group me(with the hand), pe- (with the foot). At the same time our attitude
toward hu-, head (cf. above) is reinforced when we find it grouped
with me- (instrumental), and not with omi-, hLn-, etc.
The prefixes appear in the following order:
First position: te- (eius), me- (suus), mai'-, ho- (it), ma- (it), on-.
Second position: hLn-, o'mi-, ho- (begin), wil-, ku-, te- (come).
Third position: tc-a-.
Fourth position: ma-, me-, mo-, mu- (all local), pa-, pa-, te-, te(local), na- (local).
Fifth position: me- (with hand), na- (with mouth), pe- (with foot),
wi- (general instrumrentality), hu- (head), cu-.
Sixth position: na- (idiomatic), pi-, pv- (?).
The place held by the pronominal prefixes is significant. There are
two such groups, the possessive-reflexive (te-, me-, mai'-) and the pronominal objects (ma-, ho-, on-). te- always precedes me-. The former
group always precede the latter, and this suggests that the verb is
apparently conceived of as a noun. In the discussion on syntax we
shall know that in narratives it is treated as a semi-nominalized construction, a possessed object, and that te-, me-, and mai'- also have
the force of relative pronouns. This is apparently an old type of construction in Yukian for Kroeber seems to imply it in what he says of
Yuki proper.'6
ma- and ho- had perhaps best be interpreted as old proclitic variants of demonstratives ma- from *me, this, and ho- from he-, the first
set probably not related to the possessive me-. Their development into
prefixes I regard as most certainly due to the nominalizing influence
of te-, me-, and mai'-, and is not at all to be ascribed to any tendency
toward fusion between ho- and ma- and the verb-stem itself. In other
words these prefixes are not of the same order as the third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth position elements.
on- is undoubtedly a recent development and shows quite nicely
how te- etc., welded all the elements that came after it into a more or
less indissoluble phonetic unit. This must have been largely encouraged
by the comparative phonetic- weakness of on- as contrasted with its
original form of ani, the -i of which was apparently.felt as a subjective
case, thus leading to its irregular loss in order to form the objective.

"[Vol. 27Labials.-p is medial. We can safely assume that like the dental
and palatal stops, the labials originally also had a three-fold series,
although today only p and p' are found. p' is rather uncommon.
Dentals.-t is quite distinct from the ordinary English sound and
more like that of Spanish. Occasionally, in initial position, it was
heard as English d. t. in present-day speech has not infrequently
fallen together with t but not to the same extent as k. with k. t' represents a fairly weakly glottalized t but seems to have been only rarely
confused with t.
t and V' represent a true series quite distinct from t. In addition
to being palatalized t gives the impression acoustically of a lateral
consonant and was indeed often written as tr. These sounds, we know,
have a fairly extensive distribution. I personally am inclined to regard
them as transformations of the lateral 1.
Palatals.-k is medial. It was never heard as a sonant. k- was
heard in two positions, as a back-palatal and as intermediate between
k. and weak velar q. The velar tinge was so inconsistently given that
it seemed best to regard it as of no importance. My final feeling was
that two distinct k's were involved here, a back-palatal and a velar
which- have today practically fallen together both in Wappo and Yuki
proper.
k' shows a marked tendency to merge with k..
Affricatives.-That tc and ts are quite distinct is unquestionable,
although they resemble each other so closely that they were, at times,
difficult to keep apart, just as in the case of c and s. Both these consonants, however, often resembled c and s acoustically and it is just
conceivable that in addition to the series tc and ts there may have
existed in Wappo or Yuki, at one time, a series intermediate between
tc and c and ts and s.
Spirants.-c and s, although so similar in sound that they were
frequently confused, are quite distinct in origin. They were never
heard as j or z.
Nasals.-They are pronounced as in English.
Laterals.- 1has the continental value. Occasionally it was heard
as dorsal (1). But this is quite secondary and due to a preceding
aspirated vowel.
As pointed out above, a frequent phonetic phenomenon in Wappo
is the merging of unaspirated and of glottalized stops with long stops.
The most obvious interpretation seems to be, that owing to the small
number of people still speaking Wappo fluently, the various consonantal series have developed a tendency to assimilate.",[19]
"2[Vol. 27new and particular data as that presented by primitive languages, was
thus almost completely lost and primitive idioms became merely new
sources for illustrating the results obtained in the realm of IndoEuropean linguistics.
In America a complete, or almost complete, diVorce from the work
of the great philologists of Europe produced precisely the opposite
result. The two cardinal dogmas of the Jung-Grammatiker, that
phonetic changes are unconscious and without exception and that
analogy plays a tremendous r6le in all languages, are either entirely
neglected or only incidentally treated. This freedom from the restraint
of the classical school of philologists is of the greatest importance and
significance. It enabled Kroeber in his study of Yokuts boldly and
bluntly to deny the first (and most fundamental) dogma of BrugmannLeskien that phonetic changes are without exception. He says:'
The rules for the change of the verb-stem do not apply at all to the noun.
The addition, to certain stems, of one and the same suffix to indicate both the
objective and plural has quite different effects on the stem-vowel according to
the significance of the suffix ... . The vocalic mutations in the language can
therefore not be regarded as due to a single complex system of harmony which is
always equally operative and differs in its results only through dissimilarity of
circumstances. It is evident that there exists a general tendency toward vocalic
harmony which takes form differently not only according to phonetic influences
but in accord with logical differences such as the grammatical categories and the
distinctions of the parts of speech. The Yokuts vocalic system thus is arbitrary
rather than phonetically automatic and appears to be influenced as much by impulses
to express linguistic forms as by purely physiological habits.2In another place he says of Yokuts:
In other words an abstract grammatical distinction entirely suspends and
again sets in operation (a) concrete and physical phonetic law.3Such a new outlook is not only healthy but necessary if progress is
to be made. I personally believe Kroeber is not right and that his
method of procedure-namely, to claim that we do not have to go
beyond what we actually have knowledge of (in this case one or two
dialects of Yokuts of one particular time)4-is, to my mind, not only
non-historical but needlessly iconoclastic.
This same spirit of detachment from entangling alliances with the
results of Indo-European linguistic researches is found in all the utterances of Boas. In one of his last statements he presents his conclusions
as follows:5

"[VoL 27It is quite possible that the same scheme once existed in Wappo
and Yukian in general and that such imperative forms as -lumi, -tdlumi,
-kdlumi are the remnants of it.",[127]

vowel, thus suggesting that -hv- was regularly elided before the.tenseaspect suffixes -mi, -sr, -ct. The reason for the behavior of the past
tense -ta and -ki is not clear. Phonetically the problem had perhaps
better be posited in another way, namely, not why the aspect indefinites
and the past have elided -hv- but why the future and imperative have
preserved it, and this admits of an answer (§§68, 70, 71).

(me)tc'u'yel-si, future
(na)mo'iyel-si, futureWe are dealing here apparently with the syncope of -e and vocalization of y to i, to judge by the future and imperative. In all likelihood, however, the e' is merely reduced -a, preserved in a few futures,
barring a few exceptions. This *-ya is the auxiliary verb ""to go"" that
has become fused to many stems. In those cases where the future
shows that we are dealing with a true diphthong this is to be regarded
as a vowel mutation expressing aspect (hai, let-, wai-, moi-).
Type 6.-Only c+v+c+v occurs, although c+vv in the indefinite
in the form.

thematic vowel indefinites. The elision of the vowel -e (reduced -a)
and -a is again connected with the tense-aspect suffixes. The -wv itself
is unquestionably the petrified suffix -wa. The pasts in -ta are irregular1929]Baditn: A Grammar of the Wappo Language81as in the c+v' and c+v+i forms, and the remarks made (types 3 and 5)

characteristic indefinite is either -se or -ce. The -1- increment while
devoid of any specific meaning now had unquestionably a plural force
at one time, and some verbs still form their plural in this manner
(cf. §85). There seems little doubt but that at one time -1- was as
regularly suffixed to the indefinite as to the future and preterit but
was then displaced by usitative and durative -se and -ce or lost entirely,
just as it is practically slowly disappearing from the future-preterit.
It is perhaps best preserved in the imperative where it was protected
by the imperative plural suffix -mi. However, it, is not infrequently
preserved in the imperative singular even in cases where it is lost in
the indefinite, future, and preterit.
-1- regularly reduces the terminal vowel of the stem to -e-.

"[Vol. 27impersonal, and inactive verbs; -a connected with transitive and active;
-u with the passive; -i with the durative-usitative, and -a with the
subjunctive.
So far, however, we have only considered the terminal vowels.
But in Wappo we find, not infrequently, that changes in the vowel of
the stem itself are correlated with changes in the meaning of certain
verbs; that, for instance, durative, intensive, diminutive, and other
activities are expressed by mutations in the initial consonant or the
basic vowel of the stem. That these are not accidental is indicated
by the fact that the consonantal change is from glottalized to unglottalized, from affricative to corresponding sibilant, from affricative to
corresponding stop, etc., and that the vocalic shifts are consistently
vowel to diphthong for intensive and vowel to -i for durative, etc.
It is certainly a significant fact that the terminal vowel ablaut is
almost exclusively connected with voice and mode,- and the consonantal and basic stem-vowel ablaut with the expression of aspect.
There is some reason for believing the first type of ablaut (terminal
vowel of disyllabic stems), to be a secondary Wappo trait not shared
by Yukian in general,33, but there seems no justification for so interpreting the second type. There are numerous indications in Yuki
proper, for example the meaning of vowel-doubling, etc., suggesting
that it is an old and fundamental Yukian trait.
In short, we may postulate at least eight bases: stem without a
formative; active-transitive -a-; intransitive-impersonal -i; passive -u;
durative -i; intensive diphthong; diminutive consonantal ablaut and
subjunctive-hortatory -a. To these must then be added the so-called
expanded, i.e., the increment, bases.
1. Active-transitive, -a.-Active and transitive does not perhaps completely define the force of this formative, for verbs in -a occur that
cannot be brought under this rubric. Some of these are undoubtedly
simply stems in -a, since not all verbs ending in -a have necessarily
had their final vowel interpreted as active-transitive. Certain forms
like hopi'la, it is full, as contrasted with opi'l-mi, to fill (transitive),
present difficulties. Either -a has in addition to its active-transitive
significance some other meaning not quite clear, or the -a of hopila is
the petrified causative -a, the verb consequently meaning, to make it
filled. The second is, I feel, the correct interpretation. In this case
we are fortunate enough to know that pil is the stem. In such examples,
however, as e'laca, to dig deep, as contrasted with its related o-e'li, to
dig out, we are in no such advantageous position. o-e'li is intransitive
33 I personally believe that it is a fairly old trait of Yukian.",[71]
"1929]Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language25The nominal stem shows only one example of ablaut, namely-the
subjective case which is formed by the mutation of all terminal vowels
of disyllabic stems to -i. TQ this must be added the regular change of
the plural suffix -te to -ti and of dual koto to kati in the subjective.
The development of terminal vowel mutations into true formatives
possibly has an important bearing on the next type of change we must
consider-the loss of terminal vowel. This loss occurs frequently in
the indefinite and the past. It can be best explained by assuming that
as the terminal vowel came to be regarded as a formative associated
with specific meaning it was felt to be a detachable element and was
then frequently lost under favorable phonetic conditions, etc.
The accretion of a consonant presents no difficulties. These consonants are all old suffixes, sometimes charged with specific meaning, at
other times vague, or with no meaning perceptible at present.
The irregular survival of ablauted, apocopated, and increment
stems in one form or another has given rise to such irregularity that
today the verbs must be grouped into distinct classes on the basis of
the form assumed by the indefinite as contrasted with the future and
past. The indefinite stem shows mutated vowel, loss of vowel and loss
of syllable while the future-past shows retention of vowel and increments.","[33, 34]"
