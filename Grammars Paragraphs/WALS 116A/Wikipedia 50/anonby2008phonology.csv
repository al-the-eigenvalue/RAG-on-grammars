"10.1.2.2 The affirmative particle yó
The affirmative particle yó ‘indeed’ has the effect of affirming a clause or putting focus
on an Indicative clause constituent. When it is simply juxtaposed with a noun, a
presentational clause or an answer results.
kwéé yó
Kwe indeedhere is Kwe / it is KweWith the exception of interrogative pronouns (6.2), sentences consisting of a single word
are not permitted; thus, in cases where a noun is used to answer a question—as shown by
the preceding example—it is always accompanied by yó.
The particle yó may also be applied to complete verbless clauses (10.1.3).

"Most commonly, interrogative pronouns co-occur with the question particle nà
(10.1.2.1). If the interrogative pronoun is the subject of the clause, it comes in the usual
subject position (before the verbal complex; see 10.1.1) and the question particle comes
at the end of the clause.

"If the interrogative pronoun and question particle are found alone in a clause, or if the
interrogative pronoun is found in clause-final position (e.g. as an object, adverbial
complement, or predicate nominal), the pronoun and question particle form a single
phonological word.

TAM particles are divided into two groups, one of which functions with Indicative
clauses (cf. 7.4.1), and the other of which functions with Optative (7.4.2) verb forms. All
of these particles are consistently found in post-verbal position; the patterning of these
particles in clauses is described in 10.1.2.
7.6.1.1.1 Indicative particles
TAM particles found with clauses containing Indicative verb forms have been described
in greater detail in 10.1.2. These are as follows:

In some cases, a word or phrase may in itself constitute a complete utterance even though
it does not meet the minimal formal requirements for a clause (i.e., subject plus
predicate). While its significance is bound to the discourse of which is it a part, it is
syntactically independent. Items which typically pattern in this way in Mambay include
interjections, swear words, commands, vocatives and formulae as well as affirmative and
negative markers. The following serve as examples:

In Mambay, clauses are related within a sentence by means of coordination (10.2.1) and
subordination (10.2.2). In the present discussion, a description of clause combinations is
carried out with an emphasis on the morphemes as well as the syntactic structures that
make relations between clauses possible.","[455, 456, 457]"
"1.2.1 Earlier studies on Mambay
Mambay word lists are found in Strümpell (1910), Lukas (1937), Baudelaire (1944;
numerals), Stauch (1966; fish names), Eguchi (1971), Elders (field notes from 1992/3)
and Hamm (2001).
Classificatory remarks on Mambay are found in Tessmann (1932), Westermann (1940,
1948, 1952), Baudelaire (1944), Greenberg (1955, 1963), Samarin (1971), Boyd (1974,
1978, 1989a), Ubels and Ubels (1980), Hagège (1981), Bennett (1983), Dieu and Renaud
(1983), Mann and Dalby (1987), Bright (1992), Elders (2000), Grimes (2000a, 2000b),
and Hamm (2001). These remarks have formed the basis for the classification presented
in 1.2.2.
Among these sources, the two articles which constitute important exceptions to a general
tendency of brevity and uncertainty are those of Eguchi (1971) and Hamm (2001). In his
Esquisse de la langue Mambaï, Eguchi expresses the hope that “ce rapport préliminaire,
sans doute plein de fautes dûes au manque d’investigation intensive, pourra être utile”
(1971:139). Eguchi’s study, while basic, has nonetheless been indispensable as a starting
point for the present investigation of Mambay. It provides concise background to the
language before presenting a brief phonology and morphology; these sections are
followed by the transcription and translation of a story as well as an 800-word lexicon.
Eguchi’s work raises a number of interesting questions on the language in the areas of
consonant and vowel inventory, alternations in tone, length and nasality, tone-consonant
interaction (p. 155) and the absence of tongue-root vowel harmony. Perhaps most
remarkable is his positing of nasal implosives (p. 144). This question is revisited in the
present research in 2.1.7.1.",[28]
"4.4.2 The expectation marker m
The expectation marker (here symbolized as m ) is a non-segmental morpheme which
raises the pitch of a phrase-final mora. Although its phonological identity may initially
seem unclear, evidence suggests that like TRS (4.4.1), it is intonational rather than tonal
(4.4.2.2). It has three important roles in the cohesion of text, all of which broadly relate
to expectancy in a discourse: topicalization, the signalling of an incomplete utterance, and
rhetorical question marking (4.4.2.3).
4.4.2.1 Phonetic realizations
The expectation marker has the consistent effect of raising the register of a phrase-final
mora. When it links to a L-toned mora, this mora is realized with a high pitch equivalent
to that of an (actual or hypothetical) preceding H-toned mora; and when it links to a Htoned mora, the mora is realized with a super-high pitch several intervals (4.1.1) above
the baseline realization of the H-toned mora.

nàmzá
animal:PLm
EXPECTm
EXPECT[kúú]
bushland, …(cf. 4.4.2.3)[nàmh zá]
animal, …(cf. 4.4.2.3)4.4.2.2 Phonological identity
Phonologically, the expectation marker displays behaviour characteristic of both tone and
intonation. Its confinement to a single mora as well as its phonetically consistent effect
on pitch (4.4.2.1) are occurrences one might expect of a tonal element.
However, there is evidence that the expectation marker is essentially intonational. As
the examples in the preceding section show, the expectation marker may attach to and be
realized in words for which each TBU is already associated with a tone.
Because it does not require its own mora to be realized, it is necessary to address the
possibility that the expectation marker might be a replacive tone. However, the mora to
which it links continues to reflect the relative pitch of the underlying tone (the pitch of
raised L is still a consistent interval lower than raised H; see the examples immediately
above and 4.3.2.1). In this respect, the expectation marker functions intonationally rather
than tonally.
4.4.2.3 Pragmatic functions
The expectation marker has three important roles in the cohesion of text, all of which
broadly relate to expectancy in a discourse: topicalization (cf. 10.1.2.4), floor-holding (cf.
10.1.2.4), and rhetorical question marking (cf. 10.1.2.1). An example of each role is as
follows:148topicalization:

EXPECTyou came to look, didn’t you?
Interestingly, the first two of these three roles overlap with those of the topicalization
particle rè (10.1.2.4), and the two morphemes may be used together, as shown by the
following example:
mì rè

NOUNS
5NOUNSThis chapter is a description of nouns in Mambay. The first major section (5.1) outlines
the morphological structure of nouns. In particular, noun roots are presented in reference
to attested root shapes and allowable tone melodies. Prefixation is then analyzed as a
morphologically salient process involving a mixture of compounding and derivation.
Suffixation, in contrast, is referred to as a primarily derivational process which, although
it has significantly impacted noun structure, is synchronically unproductive and
morphologically indistinct. Reduplication, a minor phenomenon in regard to nouns, is
mentioned briefly.
A second major section (5.2) deals with a basic morphological distinction between free
(unmarked) and linked noun forms. Linked forms, which are subject to various
morphological templates depending on the structure of their free form, are used for head
nouns in most noun phrase constructions. Following this, a section on possessive
constructions (5.3) complements the discussion, since both free and linked forms are used
in this context. The description of possessive constructions, which are the most
important type of noun phrase construction in the language, revolves around three axes.
First of all, a continuum between spontaneous and fixed possession is established. The
issue of optional vs. obligatory possession is then considered. The greatest part of the
discussion, however, deals with the distributional and structural characteristics of
alienable vs. inalienable possession. A section on compound nouns (5.4) follows
naturally on that of possessive constructions, since most compound nouns are structured
in the same way. Formal and behavioural particularities of compound nouns are also
accounted for.
Plural formation, which comprises an additional topic (5.5), is achieved by means of a
loosely defined morphological template. In this section, the scope of pluralization is
delimited, and a range of possible structural alternations is recognized. Collective
constructions, which constitute an alternative plural-like strategy for some nouns, are also
considered (5.6).
In subsequent sections, four derivational topics are considered: participant noun
constructions (5.7), diminutives and augmentatives (5.8), verbal nouns (5.9) and the
promotion of modifiers to independent noun status (5.10). A mixture of derivational
strategies, including but not limited to affixation, is common to all four phenomena. For
verbal nouns in particular, complications in determining the direction of derivation are150acknowledged. Ordinal numerals, which constitute a closed category of nouns derived
from numerals, are dealt with in the presentation on numerals (9.1.3).
In later sections, ideophonic nouns (5.11) and proper names (5.12) are given special
attention, and the locative function of nouns is delineated in 5.13. In the final section, an
overview of noun phrase constructions is provided (5.14).","[165, 166, 167, 168]"
"2.3.2 Contrast
Although most contrasts have been established in the sections devoted to consonants
(2.1.3) and vowels (2.2.3), additional contrasts involving glottalic sequences (2.3.2.1) and
codas affected by nasality (2.3.2.2) relates to both groups of segments.
2.3.2.1 Glottalic sequences
There are a number of distributional gaps (2.3.1.2) and ambiguous sequences (2.1.4.1,
2.1.4.2, 2.3.3.3) associated with glottalic articulations. Over a syllable boundary,
however, glottalized vowels followed by a b contrast with non-glottalized vowels
followed by the implosive . This contrast persists in spite of the penetration of
glottalization from glottalic consonants into the vowels of preceding syllables (2.1.5.1).
Phonetically, the contrast is signalled by the presence vs. absence of glottalization on the
vowel in the first syllable, the persistence of phonetic implosion on the (phonetically
preglottalized) implosive stops, and the possibility of a phonetically open vs. closed
transition (i.e., oral release) between the glottalic element and the stop element.

pá à
tú ò[pá) à]
[tú) ò]metal, money

bloodThis contrast suggests that vocalic glottalization and consonantal glottalization are
phonologically independent of one another in this environment.
An equivalent contrast that might be expected with d and % is not possible because d is
never found non morpheme-initially in Mambay (2.1.2).
2.3.2.2 Codas affected by nasality
There is contrast between V7 and VV codas. This is evident in the following examples:
dú7
dúúbend down

76nà4kààrá
nà4kà7ráfaithful companion, disciple
cane, coward2.3.3 Interpretive issues
There are number of interpretive issues involving both vowels and consonants. This
topic has major implications for segmental and syllable inventories. These issues
concern the interpretation of y and w in complex onsets (2.3.3.1), pharyngeal
articulations (2.3.3.2), glottalic articulations in syllable rhymes (2.3.3.3), and syllable
rhymes ending in high vowels and semivowels (2.3.3.4).
2.3.3.1 y and w in complex onsets
Clements has noted that “it is often hard, in synchronic analysis, to determine whether a
phonetic segment such as [kw] should be analysed phonemically as /ku/, /kw/, or even as
the single segment /kw/” (2000:130). In other words, it is possible that onsets comprised
of a consonant-semivowel sequence be interpreted as CV, CC or C. In Mambay, where
this interpretive question arises, none of the three alternatives is without shortcomings.
The weakest of the three possible interpretations is that of CV (Ci and Cu). Arguments
for this alternative are that:
1. In utterance-final monosyllables, y and w are phonetically realized as vowels:
their duration is greater in this position, and they carry pitch which signals the
underlying tone melody (2.1.6.5).

"10.1.1 Constituent order
In Anonby (2005:8–13), constituent order in Mambay is detailed, and the effects of
changes in order are also examined. In the present study, a basic summary is provided.
In Mambay, the basic (unmarked) order of major constituents in verbal clauses is rigidly
SVO (subject–verb–object).

recipient. Two strategies are available in such situations, and in both cases, the more
salient object in the discourse follows the other object. If the more salient object is a
patient, it simply follows the recipient:
Ø

to 1SG.OBJIn both cases, object pronouns (6.1.3.1) are used for a pronominal recipient.
Subsequent to the SVO complex, the following order is exhibited: directional adverb –
locative (spatial or temporal) adverbial complement – aspectual or descriptive adverbial
complement – particle. Examples which illustrate this ordering are as follows:

A small number of particles are used in reference to clauses and clause constituents.
(Particles which are used to define relations between clauses are discussed separately in
10.2.2).
Unlike adverbs, which are minimally comprised of a heavy syllable, clause- and clause
constituent-modifying particles uniformly exhibit a light (CV) syllable.
These particles fall into three groups: Indicative particles, Optative particles, and an
attributive copula ká. While Indicative particles are treated in the present section,
Optative particles are described in the chapter on verbs (7.6.1.1.2), and the attributive
copula is described in the context of verbless clauses (10.1.3.2).
Four Indicative particles are found in Mambay:
nà
yó
yá
rè(question particle; see also 4.4.2.3)
(affirmative particle)
(negative particle)
(topicalization particle)Indicative particles are used in reference to clauses as well as clause constituents. Since
the core of a clause is prototypically a verb, applying a particle to a verbal clause is
formally and functionally equivalent to applying it to the verb (see 7.6.1.1 for examples).
In the following section, each of the Indicative particles is shown (whenever attested) in a
verbless clause, with an Indicative verb, and with at least one other clause constituent.
10.1.2.1 The question particle nà
When the question particle nà is juxtaposed with a noun, an interrogative clause results.
kwéé nà
Kwe QMis it Kwe?","[448, 449, 450]"
"360TAM indicators are prototypically found with verbs. The syntactic distribution of each
group is distinctive (and as concerns adverbs, complex), and is discussed in the individual
subsections. The examples in the following subsections show that while TAM indicators
expressing aspect are found with a wide range of verb forms, those which express
distinctions of mood are often limited to Optative forms.
TAM indicators found with Indicative verbal forms are also attested with verbless clauses
(10.1.3). Representative examples of this are as follows:
- example particle with a verbless clause:
yó ‘indeed, (affirmative particle)’ (10.1.2.2)

examples:

"11While Eguchi concentrates on linguistic aspects of Mambay, Hamm’s (2001)
Sociolinguistic survey of the Mambay of Cameroon and Chad provides a complementary
portrayal of the language. Although its stated purpose is to examine possibilities for
language development (p. 2), Hamm’s study offers findings regarding key topics such as
demographics, multilingualism, dialect variation, intelligibility with related varieties,
language attitudes and other related sociolinguistic questions.
In addition to these two longer sources, a number of articles have been written on
Mambay in the context of the present research. A provisional version of the standard
Mambay orthography appeared in 2004 (Anonby 2004a; see also 1.3.3). In the same
year, a paper was presented in which the labial flap was described in Mambay (2004b).
In that study, which has been developed in a recent article (2007), it is argued that the
labial flap is profoundly phonologized (see also 2006:224 and section 2.1.8 in the present
study). Elsewhere, a preliminary description of the structure of discourse in Mambay has
appeared (2005). In addition to these studies, an article has been published which
outlines the phonetic inventory and basic phonological system of Mambay. It is
accompanied by recordings of phonetic data, including a longer text which is also
transcribed phonetically (2006). Further, in a work that is both descriptive and
comparative/historical in nature, a set of vestigial noun suffixes is defined; its effect on
the morphological structure of nouns is delineated, and its origins are explored (2007b).
Finally, a short sketch of Mambay grammar and phonology is destined to appear in the
Mambay dictionary (Anonby and Oussoumanou 2008 forthcoming) along with an
updated version of the orthography which includes tone marking.","[28, 29]"
"When used with the conjunction kóó ‘-ever, even if’ and the question particle nà
(10.1.2.1), interrogative pronouns become non-interrogative but still exhibit an ‘-ever’

VERBS
7VERBSThe Mambay verb system exhibits richness in the types of available verb structures as
well as the functional distinctions represented by combinations of these structures. These
possibilities are outlined in the following paragraphs.
The first major section of this chapter (7.1) introduces verb stems. While some are
canonical and morphologically simple, others are non-canonical and, in some cases,
morphologically complex. Non-canonical verbs result from the application of verbal
extensions, derivation of verbs from other parts of speech, the ideophonic nature of some
verbs, and borrowing of verbs from other languages.
The set of verbal extensions is the most significant way in which verb stems are
composed, and is investigated in detail in 7.2. This set is reminiscent of systems found
elsewhere in Niger-Congo. While some extensions found in Mambay are synchronically
productive, others are not; also, the semantic transparency of verbal extensions varies.
The subsequent section (7.3) examines verb word morphology. Segmental affixes are
dealt with in detail, and the behaviour of tone in verb words is examined. In addition,
verbs are classified with respect to transitivity and tone melody. Irregular verbs are also
considered.
Verbal inflection is explored in 7.4. Specifically, this section treats basic inflectional
categories, which are marked length on subject pronouns and tone on subject pronouns
and verb words. It is shown that a division between Indicative and Optative mood is
fundamental to the verb system, and Indicative verb forms are also distinguished for
realis value and aspect. Negative verb forms, which pattern differently than their
affirmative counterparts, are treated separately in 7.5.
The expansion of verbal inflection by means of TAM indicators, possessive constructions
and complex inflectional constructions (specifically, serial and auxiliary verbs) forms the
substance of the discussion in 7.6. A final section (7.7) discusses composite verbal
expressions and their contribution to the verb lexicon.
Unless it has been otherwise specified, example verbs are given in their basic Perfective
forms (cf. 7.4.1.1.1.1).","[314, 315, 316]"
"8.4.1 Distribution of adjectives
Adjectives are used in two positions: first, in the dependent position of a noun phrase
(5.14.2); and secondly, as an attributive predicate (10.1.3.3). In this section, both
possibilities are compared with nouns found in an equivalent position. They are also
compared with adverbs which, although they are structurally similar to adjectives, have a
distinct syntactic distribution.
Adjectives are syntactically distinct from nouns, which are also used to express noun
attributes. It is true that in noun phrases, it is not possible to distinguish nouns and
adjectives syntactically (5.14.1, 5.14.2):
noun + adjective:bàh
míz4míz
rain:LF drizzlydrizzly rainnoun + noun:bàh
pâh
rain:LF wetnesswet rainHowever, the difference between adjectives and nouns may be deduced from attributive
predicate constructions: an adjective is juxtaposed with the noun it modifies (10.1.3.3),
but an attributive noun is always connected to the noun it modifies with the copula ká
(10.1.3.2):
adjective:)à
3IMPERSmíz4míz
drizzlynoun:)à
3IMPERSká
ATTRIB391it is drizzly
pâh it is wet
wetnessThe situation is comparable for adjectives and ideophonic adverbs (8.3). Although there
are many structural similarities between these two classes, there are differences in
syntactic distribution. As shown above and repeated in the following examples,
adjectives are found in the dependent position of a noun phrase or in an attributive
predicate.
dependent position:bàh
míz4míz
rain:LF drizzlyattributive predicate: )à
3IMPERSmíz4míz

and can only be followed by a particle (10.1.1).

Following a nominal object, adjectives as well as adverbs may be found. If the postobject item in question is an adjective which describes the object, the object displays
linked noun morphology (5.2.2).
tìgín

However, if the item is an adverb, the object lacks this morphology since the adverb
modifies the verb or clause rather than the object.

This morphology usually serves to identify the word class of the post-object word, even
when the word in question is an ideophone showing flexibility between adjectival and
adverbial class membership (8.5.6).

However, in cases where the object noun is of a structure whose linked form is identical
to its free (unmarked) form (5.2.2), the distinctiveness of the flexible ideophone as
adjective vs. adverb is neutralized.

In the following subsections, the structure of adjectives is outlined. First, the distinction
between adjective stem and morphologically complex adjective stem is examined in
reference to the structural repetition which is common among adjectives (8.4.2.1).
Adjectival structure is then presented in terms of allowable CV shapes (8.4.2.2) and tonal
melodies (8.4.2.3).
8.4.2.1 Structural repetition
Structural repetition is a pervasive feature of adjectives in Mambay, where it has been
observed only in adjectives with more than one syllable. It is evident in repetition of
segments (8.4.2.1.1) as well as partial and full reduplication (8.4.2.1.2). A review of
these phenomena shows that while co-occurrence patterns and partial reduplication must
be considered inherent to the adjectival root, full reduplication is the result of a
morphological template associated with the root (8.4.2.1.2), even when no derivation may
be identified. Consequently, in the discussion on adjective structure, monomorphemic
adjective stems will be considered separately from morphologically complex adjective
stems.
8.4.2.1.1 Repetition of segments
Repeated segments are found in almost every adjective with more than one syllable. In
the data, for example, vowels within an adjective are overwhelmingly identical.

kpírfí
làr àg
yérkété7deep, far away

round393Formally, the limitation of adjectives to a single vowel place quality is slightly less strict
(since vowels in the adjective may still be unevenly subject to modifications such as
length and pharyngealization). However, it is found with extreme regularity.

usually identical. The overlapping of these two tendencies means that entire syllable
rhymes are, more often than not, repeated. This could alternatively be viewed as
variation of the onset with a constant rhyme.

Additionally, the composition of three-syllable adjectives in particular reveals repetition
of entire syllables; this brings to mind reduplication of a greater scope than simple
repetition. In most examples of three-syllable adjectives, the final two syllables are
identical.
rùgùgù
vbàhtátá
wágágáslow
strong and healthy
healthy, cool(but cf. kpìmsìrì ‘thick, fat’)
And for typical two-syllable adjectives—including those for which a derivation (8.5) is
not identifiable—it appears that full reduplication has applied, resulting in adjective
stems composed of a single repeated syllable.
kpó’4kpó’
lòr4lòr
pyúú4pyúúdry

394Several derivational processes (8.5) are available to provide evidence as to whether or not
such words are morphologically complex stems derived from a monosyllabic root. One
derivation in particular, that of ideophonic emphasis (8.5.2), is used here to explore this
question. The intensified forms of the two-syllable CVC.CVC and CVV.CVV adjectives
are as follows:
kpí4kpó’
lì4lòr
pí4pyúúvery dry
very shiny with baldness
very pointed, very sharpIn these forms, only one of the two syllables is used as a source for the derivation.
However, when three-syllable adjectives undergo the same derivation, all segmental
information is preserved:slow

wágágáríì4rúgúgú
vbíì4vbáhtátá
wíì4wágágáFurther specifications are needed to accurately delineate these patterns. First, the twosyllable adjective à à ‘shy,’ which is of an uncommon CV.CV shape, is exceptional in
that its emphatic form íì4 á á does not pattern with the typical two-syllable adjectives
above, but with other adjectives, whose segmental information is copied in its entirety.
Second, the single attested four-syllable adjective kírí4kìrì ‘spherical’ does not have a
derived emphatic form; this makes the determination of its morphological composition
problematic. However, since adjectives and ideophonic adverbs undergo some of the
same derivational processes, it is possible to argue that the derivation of an ideophonic
adverb of the same shape (see 8.5.4.2 in particular) provides evidence for a
morphological complexity similar to that of typical two-syllable adjectives.
tégú4tègù
tégú tègù tégúwith head and chin sticking out
back and forth, with head and chin sticking outIn sum, the data presented here suggest that typical two-syllable adjective stems with
identical reduplicated syllables (CVC.CVC and CVV.CVV) are morphologically
complex. In contrast, other stems in which the last two syllables are identical appear to
be morphologically simple stems whose repetition is a function of their ideophonic
identity rather than a morphological process.
8.4.2.2 Allowable CV shapes
Based on the principles outlined in section (8.4.2.1.2) above, allowable shapes for
adjectives are divided into those that consist of morphologically simple stems (8.4.2.2.1),
and those that occur as morphologically complex stems (8.4.2.2.2).","[408, 409, 410, 411, 412]"
"4.3.3.3 The case of HTS non-application with two-mora HLH nouns
As stated above, there are two examples of a HLH melody on two-mora nouns (4.1.2.2):
nánà T ‘maternal uncle’ and )ázì T ‘member of )àzgárà’ (see Glossary). The second H
tone of these nouns floats on their right edge. Phrase-finally, it has no realization or other
effect; such nouns sound like HL nouns in this context (4.1.2.6).
HL (phrase-final):

HLH (phrase-final): nánà T [nánâ]eye, face, life
maternal uncleHowever, when two-mora HLH nouns are found as linked forms (5.2.2) in the head
position of possessive constructions (5.3), they behave differently than HL nouns: HTS is
prevented from applying to the first H of two-mora HLH nouns because of the presence
of the floating H on the right edge, which itself prevents the L tone from being delinked
(for a description of segmental alternations that accompany the linked form, see 5.2.2.2).

persist on the surface (in the form of perturbation in the realization of other tones), since
other LH contours in linked nouns are consistently simplified to L (4.3.1.1):
kíkòví + gbòndòrò

since a process which affects some H tones could affect them all in the same way (i.e.,
non-realization). Still, it is a reasonable conjecture that a floating H might behave
differently than one which is associated (cf. Yip 1989:151). Since no other workable
account has been ascertained, the idea of a floating H tone on the right edge of nánà T
and )ázì T has been maintained throughout the discussion.","[159, 160]"
"2.1.3 Contrast
Contrast among oral consonants may be established from the morpheme-initial inventory
(2.1.2.1), and contrast between nasal and oral consonants is evident in morpheme-final
position (2.1.2.3). Outstanding issues in contrast which call for additional evidence are
the inventory of nasals (2.1.3.1) and the limitation of voicing contrast in obstruents
(2.1.3.2).
Additional questions involving the interpretation of consonants are addressed in 2.1.4.
2.1.3.1 Contrast among nasals
Since 7 and N7 are not found in syllable onsets, contrast among nasal consonants must be
demonstrated in coda position. The following set of words shows this:

Voiced and voiceless oral obstruents contrast in morpheme-initial position (2.1.2.1).
However, in non morpheme-initial positions, voicing contrast is almost always absent.
For the obstruent pairs p/b, k/g, f/v and s/z, phonetically voiceless obstruents are found
in codas, while phonetically voiced counterparts are found in non morpheme-initial
onsets. k/g is exceptional in that it may be optionally voiced in codas (2.1.6.1), but it is
consistent with the other obstruents in that there is no contrast signalled by voicing in this
position. In other words, non morpheme-initial obstruents are specified for place of
articulation, but not for voicing. Examples of obstruents in each position, along with
phonetic realizations, are as follows:

frighteninglyWhen voiced oral obstruents in syllable onsets are reassigned to coda position as a result
of syntactic and morphophonological processes, they lose their voicing (2.1.6.1). This is
evident in the following possessive constructions (cf. 5.3):

my first child after remarriageThis phenomenon strengthens the argument that the obstruent pairs do not exhibit
contrast non morpheme-initially. If the present discussion is taken into consideration, the
resyllabification of the obstruents as coda consonants is sufficient to explain the change
in voicing.
Since (with the exception of t and d) they show no contrast in non morpheme-initial
position, oral obstruents are written throughout this study using a single symbol, namely
that of the voiced counterpart (which is, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph,
devoiced as a result of resyllabification in codas). This is consistent with the standard
Mambay orthography (1.3.3).
t and d differ from other oral obstruents in three ways. First, it is the voiceless obstruent
t rather than d that is found (albeit uncommonly) in non morpheme-initial onsets
(2.1.2.2).

462.1.4 Issues in consonant interpretation
The phonological status of three consonantal phenomena requires interpretation: that of
the glottal stop in morpheme-initial position (2.1.4.1), preglottalized semivowels
(2.1.4.2), and palatal and labialized velar nasals (2.1.4.3).
2.1.4.1 The glottal stop in morpheme-initial position
The glottal stop poses interpretive challenges in morpheme-initial position as well as in
syllable rhymes. In morpheme-initial position, it is debatable whether or not the glottal
stop is a contrastive consonant or whether it is demarcative (that is, a predictable effect of
its morphological context); this question is posed in Anonby (2006:224) but is not
answered there. In syllable rhymes, the glottal stop could be interpreted as a consonant, a
vowel feature, or a feature associated with glottalic consonants that follow vowels. The
two issues are related, since positing contrast for the glottal stop in one position would
have consequences for the other position. The phonological status of the glottal stop in
morpheme-initial position is addressed in the present section, and its status elsewhere is
pursued in 2.3.3.3.
The glottal stop is phonetically salient in morpheme-initial position:

‘thing’)
to weave something (cf. kàm ‘weave (VN),’
)ígà ‘thing’)
to see something (cf. kòg ‘see (VN),’ )ígà
‘thing’)There are two interpretive possibilities for the glottal stop: it could arise predictably
before vowels in morpheme-initial position, or it could be a contrastive consonant there.
On the one hand, it is not unreasonable to posit the predictable articulation of the glottal
stop whenever a morpheme is vowel-initial. Studies of other Kebi-Benue languages have
uniformly followed this interpretation (see Elders 2006 for a listing), and the most
47important comparative/historical study in this family does not regard the glottal stop as a
member of the proto-language’s morpheme-initial consonant inventory (Boyd 1974:33).
On the other hand, there are some satisfactory arguments that the glottal stop contrasts
with other consonants in morpheme-initial position. The invariable realization of the
glottal stop before morpheme-initial vowels, as in the above examples, is one of these
indicators. The contrastive value of glottalic articulations elsewhere in the language as
part of glottalic consonants (2.1.5) and glottalized vowels (2.2.1) also supports this
possibility, and one morphophonological process in which a glottal stop contributes its
glottalic feature to a vowel (5.12.1.1) underlines such a phonological relationship.
Further, the positing of contrast here would help to address the relatively low incidence
of morphemes which would otherwise be considered vowel-initial (about 1% of nouns
and 5% of verbs). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it promotes a simpler inventory
of allowable CV shapes (cf. 2.4.1); there is no need to posit several additional V-initial
syllables.
Given these factors, the morpheme-initial glottal stop is treated as a consonant in the
present study.
2.1.4.2 Preglottalized semivowels
The categorization of phonetically preglottalized semivowels [)y] and [)w] in syllable
onsets also calls for interpretation. Given the interpretation of the glottal stop as
contrastive (2.1.4.1), and given that the language permits consonant sequences in
morpheme-initial syllable onsets where y or w is the second consonant (2.1.2.5), then two
options are available for the interpretation of [)y] and [)w] onsets: as CC clusters )y and
)w, or as contrastive C units Q (=Ny) and Nw. There is no contrast between these two
phonological possibilities in the language, so a single interpretation is appropriate.
Both [)y] and [)w] are moderately represented in the lexicon; in fact, there are about as
many words beginning with these onsets as there are words beginning with [)] followed
by a vowel. This lends a small amount of support in favour of a unitary interpretation of
[)y] and [)w], but is not decisive.
The existence of preglottalized stops in syllable codas (2.1.2.3, 2.1.2.4 above) should be a
crucial factor in determining their status in morpheme-initial onsets; however,
preglottalized stops are also ambiguous in coda position, since they depend on the
interpretation of V-glottal-C sequences as vowels followed by a preglottalized consonant
(2.3.3.3).
There is, in fact, one substantial problem with an interpretation of [)y] and [)w] as
sequences: the occurrence of [)y] in a morpheme-internal onset in two lexical items.
NmàQá
[Nmà)yá]
‘fast’
ná4dâr4kwéQà [nádârkwé)yà] ‘tree sp.’48Since syllables with y and w as the second onset consonant are always morpheme-initial
(and never morpheme-internal), a unitary interpretation of these onsets as Q is necessary
here. The parallel interpretation of Q as a single C in morpheme-initial position is a
natural consequence of this assessment.
In order to maintain symmetry with Q, it is appropriate to interpret [)w] as the unit
consonant Nw. The resulting analysis of Q and Nw as contrastive units accords well with
descriptions of several other Kebi-Benue languages (Ubels and Ubels 1984:20; Elders
1995:1, 2000:23, 2006; see also ambiguous data in Ruelland 1992:30).
2.1.4.3 Palatal and labialized velar nasals
The consonant chart given in 2.1.1 shows that palatal and labialized velar nasals \ and 7w
are not included in the inventory of contrastive consonants. The same is true for the
glottalized counterparts of these nasals. In reality, these gaps in the inventory result from
the interpretation of phonetic palatal and labialized velar nasals as nasalized semivowels.
The reasoning behind this interpretation is given in the present section first for palatal
nasals, and then for labialized velar nasals.
Phonetically, the palatal nasal [\] and the preglottalized palatal nasal [)\] are found in a
subset of onset and coda positions. In utterance-initial position and following
morphemes that end in an oral segment, both [\] and [)\] are found. However, when
they follow nasal or nasalized segments within an utterance, they are realized as nasalized
semivowels [y]] and [)y]] respectively (cf. 3.3.2).
[\]âh
sáà [y]]âhstalk (n.)

and pronounced as [y]] when it is found next to a nasalized vowel in the same
phonological word (3.3.2.2, 3.4.3).

nasalized vowel: it could either be a palatal nasal \ which is structurally equivalent to y
before nasal vowels; it could be a ny sequence, since such sequences are found with other
consonants; or it could be y underlyingly. There is no contrast between the three
structures in any position.
[\] is also found in syllable codas, but its occurrence there gives no additional support to
the existence of \ as a contrastive consonant, since it is explainable as a realization of 7
after front vowels (2.1.6.7).

both [7w] and [)7w] are found in utterance-initial position and following morphemes that
end in an oral segment. When [7w] and [)7w] are found after nasal or nasalized
segments within an utterance, they too are realized as approximants:
[7w]áà
sáà [w]]áànose

Theoretically, the underlying identity of the labialized velar nasals [7w] [)7w] and
nasalized labial-velars [w]] [)w]] in these words could be any of the following pairs of
contrastive consonants or consonant sequences:
1. 7w / )7w
2. 7w / )7w
3. nw / )nw
4. mw / )mw
5. 7m / )7m
6. w / )w
The first possibility (7w / )7w) is rejected because labialization is not a feature of the
consonant system (2.1.1). The consonant sequences 7w and N7w in (2) are not viable
alternatives, since a more basic consonant 7 is never found in onset position without
labialization (2.1.2.1, 2.1.2.2). The sequences in (3) and (4) nw mw Nmw (and Nnw by
50extension) should be ruled out because they contrast with [7w] in morpheme-initial
position, as shown by the following words:

A detailed account of glottalic articulations in unambiguously closed syllable rhymes is
an important step toward their interpretation in general.
Obstruents appear to be absent in rhymes with glottalic articulations. Consonants which
are permitted may be divided into two categories. The first category contains consonants
which are glottalized or, alternatively, have a non-glottalic counterpart (see the discussion
in this section below). These consonants, shown in the context of glottalized syllable
rhymes, are as follows:
y, Qt[ày] ~ t[à)y]sway rhythmicallyw, Nw
m, Nm
n, Nn
7, N7n[àw] ~ n[à)w]

Q[àl] ~ Q[à)l]vomit
feel, rubImportantly, there is no contrast between glottalic and non-glottalic consonants in
syllable rhymes which contain glottalic articulations.
While the symmetry between the first five pairs of non-contrasting consonants is clear,
non-glottalic counterparts of and % need further explanation. In this context, p/b is not
an ideal non-glottalic counterpart for , nor is t or d for %, since no obstruents are found
unambiguously in this glottalic environment. Interestingly, l is a preferable candidate for
the non-glottalic counterpart of %. There are five reasons for this:
1) l is not an obstruent, and is therefore (in contrast to t and d) not barred from
glottalic syllable rhymes;
2) % is realized as )l in codas (2.1.6.2);
3) V% does not contrast with V’l in rhymes;
4) verbs which appear to contain a historical verbal extension 4l on a glottalized verb
root (7.2) exhibit the same phonetic realization;
5) there is no open transition realization of V’l in syllable rhymes parallel to that of
V’r (see the next paragraph as well as the following section).
The second category of consonants is limited to r. Glottalized syllable rhymes with r
differ from those with other consonants in three ways. First, r is the only non-glottalic
sonorant consonant found in syllable codas that does not have a glottalic counterpart in
the phonology. Second, the phonetic realization of r in a glottalized rhyme is unique.
Unlike other consonants, when glottal closure is employed, it is accompanied by an open
transition consisting of a glottalized echo vowel. It is an open question whether
86differences in its realization are the product of a contrastive phonological identity or
whether they are a phonetic consequence of its rhotic or periodic (exhibiting repeated
movement) articulation. Third, unlike other consonants in the same position, it is
extremely uncommon; its distribution is restricted to four irregular verbal nouns (see the
following section for further discussion).
2.3.3.3.2 Consonantal interpretations of glottalization
Two types of consonantal interpretation are available for glottalic articulations in syllable
rhymes. While the first interpretation is relevant for all syllable rhymes, the second
interpretation is relevant in particular for glottal articulations in closed syllable rhymes.
The first interpretation is that glottalic articulations in this position are contrastive
realizations of an independently occurring glottal stop. This interpretation is, on the
whole, acceptable for glottalic articulations in open syllables. It reflects the consonantal
quality found in some realizations of such utterances (2.3.3.3.1). Also, as is the case for
pharyngeal articulations (2.3.3.2), the optional presence of an echo vowel after the point
of greatest consonantal closure is reminiscent of the articulation of the unambiguously
consonantal g in coda position (2.1.6.1). Notably, an interpretation in which glottalic
articulations in syllable rhymes are consonantal also respects the positing of a contrastive
glottal stop at morpheme boundaries (2.1.4.1). There are even two situations in which a
glottal stop at a morpheme boundary alternates with a glottal articulation in a syllable
rhyme2:
sá’4
buy+tí4+AUGn
CAUSsà)án
sell)ízà
(female name)tí’zà
(female name, respect form)One objection to this first consonantal interpretation, that of evidence from writing errors,
is parallel to that presented in the discussion on a consonantal interpretation of
pharyngealization (2.3.3.2.4). As stated above, observations have been made concerning
the errors Mambay speakers already literate in French, Fulfulde and in some cases,
Mundang, make when learning to write their own language. In the standard Mambay
orthography (1.3.3), the contrastive morpheme-initial glottal stop (2.1.4.1) is not written,
and otherwise open syllable rhymes with a glottalic articulation are written V’. When
writing an open syllable rhyme with this articulation, it is common that subjects write a
long (orthographically double) vowel (VV) rather than a glottalized vowel (V’). This
may indicate that glottalic articulations in such syllable rhymes are perceived as vocalic
rather than consonantal.","[102, 103, 104]"
"28I was able to return to the Mambay area three and a half years later under a collaborative
arrangement among SIL Chad, SIL Cameroon, COLAMA (Comité de Langue Mambay)
and MINREST (Ministère de la recherche scientifique et technique) of Cameroon. While
most of my time was to be devoted to fieldwork, I was given an opportunity to contribute
as a consultant by applying the result of my linguistics research to the development of an
orthography as part of a larger language development project (this is described in detail in
the following section). Eventually, the scope of my involvement expanded to embrace a
number of additional activities.
Much of my commitment to the language development project centred on the facilitation
of linguistics and computer courses and workshops for members of COLAMA and, later
on, the Bible translation team. This included training on phonetics and orthography, data
management, community vocabulary collection and lexicography, transcription of texts,
literacy primer construction, narrative discourse and translation. I was also privileged to
play a part in the reorganization of COLAMA, which evolved from a church-run Bible
translation committee into a non-partisan language committee whose increased repertoire
of activities came to represent and serve the Muslim as well as Christian segments of the
ethnic group.
Rather than taking away from the contemporaneous investment in fieldwork,
involvement in the language development project enriched my awareness of the Mambay
language and culture (see Kutsch Lojenga’s (1996) discussion of participatory research).
In this capacity, I was able to visit most of the larger Mambay villages; happily, these
were distributed in all three of the major dialect areas (1.2.3.3). Since all of the language
committee’s activities were conducted in Mambay (see 1.2.3.2), I was forced to pay close
attention to the language, especially at the point when colleagues in the committee felt
that it was no longer necessary to translate everything for me because I was beginning to
speak and understand the language. In addition, the vocabulary collection efforts of
several members of the language committee resulted in a lexicon of almost 2000 items.
This lexicon formed an underpinning for the 3450-word vocabulary prepared for the
purposes of this study and which will, hopefully, be published in a Mambay dictionary
(COLAMA in preparation).
Fieldwork was conducted between October 2003 and February 2006, and interposed by
two periods of write-up at Leiden University in the Netherlands: six months in 2004 and
three months in 2005. Three principal localities of field research may be distinguished:
1) the Mambay ethnic area, especially Kaakaala and the Mambay quarter of Figuil; 2) the
small Mambay community of N’Djaména; and 3) Maroua, where, with reliable
electricity, intensive instruction and elicitation sessions were conducted.
A large number of Mambay speakers assisted by providing and collecting data.
The principal collaborator for this study is Oussoumanou Ka a Bouba of Kaakyo’w
(Katchéo), Bibémi Subdivision, Bénoué Division, North Province, Cameroon. He speaks
the dialect on which this study has been primarily based, namely that which is found
south of the Mayo Kebbi River (1.2.3.3). Oussoumanou, who is 47 years old, works as a29geotechnical engineer, Bible translator, linguist, and cultivator. He is also a member of
COLAMA (Comité de Langue Mambay), and is active as a lay reader for the Catholic
community in Kaakyo’w and Bookiré. In addition to helping with hundreds of hours of
elicitation, Oussoumanou assisted by collecting vocabulary for a dictionary (COLAMA
in preparation), proofreading transcriptions, and helping defining orthographic
conventions and linguistic terminology for Mambay (see 1.3.3).
Other collaborators who contributed significantly to this study are acknowledged in the
following paragraphs.
Kada Moïse was born in Kaakaala (Kakala), Cameroon, where he still lives. He is the
deputy chief of Kaakaala, where he also works as a cultivator and community health care
facilitator. Kada hosted our family when we first moved to Kaakaala. He taught us much
useful vocabulary, and oriented us to the culture and historical context of the Mambay
people.
Sadou Kami Tao was born in Kaalaw (Kalao), Cameroon. He has lived for many years in
Figuil, Cameroon, where he worked as a civil servant until his retirement. Sadou
recounted and allowed me to record the early history of the Mambay, his own life story
and some of the vanishing religious rituals of the Mambay.
Yunusa Wuri was born in Kaagbungni (Kaboni), Chad. He now lives in Figuil, and has
worked as a merchant’s assistant. Yunusa helped with the translation of numerous texts
into French, and collaborated extensively in the production of data for tone analysis.
Titogo Tao Justin is from Kaakaala, although his family is originally from Kaagbungni.
He is now located in Figuil, where he has finished his studies and works as a tutor. Tao
was the principal resource person using the Chadian dialect of Mambay. and helped with
the elicitation of vocabulary.
Kwe Nathaniel was born in Kaagbungni, and continues to live there. He works as a grain
merchant and cultivator, and is the coordinator for COLAMA’s literacy programme. He
provided a number of texts, contributed to vocabulary collection for the dictionary, and
was active in the development of the orthography.
Koué Agabus was born in Kaagbungni. Presently, he is a pastor of an EFL (Église des
Frères Luthériens) church in Bidé, which is near Bibémi, Cameroon. Koué is a member
of the Bible translation team. He was involved in a number of training events, and
provided consistent criticism of transcribed texts and COLAMA publications.
Pévina Salomon, originally from Kaakaala and Kaagbungni, is currently studying in a
technical training school in N’Djaména. He helped with elicitation for a major initial
portion of vocabulary for the dictionary.
Badilou Kada is originally from Kaakaala. He now lives in Figuil, where he works in a
cement factory. Badilou who was the main informant from the dialect area north of the30Mayo Kebbi in Cameroon, thoughtfully and enthusiastically answered selected questions
on the language over a year-long period.
As the previous list shows, all of the major contributors to the present research were men.
The selection of collaborators reflects the choice of COLAMA and, indirectly, cultural
considerations since in Mambay culture a respectful distance is observed between the
sexes in most social contexts. Despite this shortcoming, numerous smaller selections of
data were consistently collected from women in public contexts.","[45, 46, 47, 48]"

3SG.POSS (fast speech)The absence of Qo in the data is probably due to chance rather than a systematic gap,
since yo is found and because the sequence is pronounced without alteration in words of
Fulfulde origin such as Qóólà (place name).
Conversely, occurrences of wo and wu are limited. While wo is found only in the word
)òòwó ~ )òwwó ‘yes,’ wu is limited to the morphemes )úùwú and 4 `wú, casual speech
variants of úùrú (3SG.POSS) and 4 `rú (3SG.POSS.INAL; cf. 6.1.4). Words of Fulfulde
origin with the sequence wu are reinterpreted with hu in Mambay; for example, Fulfulde
wuro ‘village’ is pronounced húrò. In addition, the arisal of wo and wu in some
complex morphological contexts results in the alternation of w with h before back vowels
(5.2.2.2.1).
2.3.1.1.2 After complex onsets
Distribution restrictions on vowels after complex syllable onsets are parallel to those
found after simple onsets (2.3.1.1.1), although only y and w are found here (2.1.2.5).
The high front vowel i is absent after y, and back vowels o u are absent after w.

1. The sequences iy and uw do not contrast with the long vowels ii and uu; all
instances of these sequences have been interpreted as long vowels (2.3.3.4).
2. Similarly, the sequences iQ and uNw do not contrast with the glottalized vowels i’
and u’; all instances of these sequences have been interpreted as glottalized
vowels (2.3.3.3), which do not show a distinction in length.
3. There are no instances where the vowel-semivowel sequences uy and iw contrast
with the semivowel-vowel sequences win/ wii and yu / yuu. All potential
occurrences of these sequences have been interpreted as semivowel-vowel
sequences (2.3.3.4); the length of the vowel in each case is determined by
behaviour of the word in non utterance-final position (cf. 2.1.6.5). A parallel
interpretation is not available for and uQ (which is not in any case attested) and
iNw, since VNC sequences are in most cases interpreted as a vowel followed by a
glottalized consonant (see 2.3.3.3).
4. The sequence oy appears to be supplanted by we / wee in Mambay. Evidence of
this comes from the borrowed Mambay word bwéè ‘domestic helper,’ which is a
reinterpretation of the word boy (Colonial British English via Hausa and Fulfulde
boy).
5. aw and ow are in variation in non morpheme-final syllables (for example,
lâwrán~ lôwrá ‘large egret sp.’), where aw is the preferred variant in careful
speech.
6. The glottalized semivowels Q and Nw are only modestly attested in coda position.
Consequently, especially as concerns Q, inherent restrictions on the vowels that
may follow these consonants are difficult to establish.","[90, 91, 92]"
"14In their (1952) classification of Sudanic languages, Westermann and Bryan provide a
more conservative grouping of Inner Sudanic than that of Westermann (1940/8). In the
later work, many of the Inner Sudanic languages are moved back into unclassified
“isolated groups.” Significantly, for the first time Mambay is included within the isolated
“Mbum” group (1952:145–7) which had itself been posited as early as Tessmann
(1932:188). This grouping prefigures most of the later lower-level classifications of
Mambay.
1.2.2.2 Position and labelling of Kebi-Benue (“Mbum”/“Adamawa 6”)
The earlier placement of Mambay within the “Mbum” group by Tessman (1932) and
Westermann (1952) is confirmed in Greenberg’s (1963; cf. 1949/55) influential
classification of African languages. Greenberg (1955:11) makes an additional advance,
however, in that he links the Mbum group with higher levels of classification. His (1949)
partition of the Sudanic languages into Niger-Kordofanian (now generally referred to as
Niger-Congo; see Williamson 1989:19) and Nilo-Saharan phyla is well-known. Within
Niger-Kordofanian, one of his innovations is the collection of a number of unclassified
languages and language families, including Mbum, under the label “Adamawa”
(1955:11). Ultimately, he joins the Adamawa languages to a neighbouring family
“Eastern” to constitute the “Adamawa-Eastern” (now Adamawa-Ubangi) branch of
Niger-Congo (1963; cf. Samarin 1971:213, 225). While some sources originally queried
this decision (e.g. Voegelin and Voegelin 1964:38–9), it has gained widespread
acceptance, although it has been defined in recent classifications as a continuum (which
may even include Gur) rather than a monolithic family (Williamson and Blench
2000:18). As regards Mambay’s inclusion among the Adamawa languages, only Caprile
(1977:18, contra 1972:36 and 1977:16) has questioned this assessment. However, he
admits that his skepticism is tentative, and does not defend it.
In Greenberg’s work, then, the Mbum family is re-labelled “Adamawa 6”—one of
fourteen Adamawa families. Boyd, who has subsequently (1974, 1978, 1989) examined
the internal structure of the Adamawa languages, views Greenberg’s groupings as
generally accurate but also as conservative: “…ces groupes sont assez homogènes,
souvent à tel point que les langues appartenant à chacun représentent plutôt de simples
dialectes d’une seule langue” (1978:187). Boyd thus proposes a conflation of Adamawa
6 (Mbum) with 13 (Bua) and 14 (Kim) into a single division (p. 190). In a (1989)
revision, he also adds the language Day to this core within Adamawa (pp. 179–80).
Essentially, the Mbum group remains an integral unit in later classifications, although
typically subsumed under the higher Adamawa 6/13/14/Day node described here
(Bennett 1983, Dieu et Renaud 1983:359 in Elders 2000:10, cp. Mann and Dalby 1987,
Boyd 1989, Bright 1992, Grimes 2000, Williamson and Blench 2000:27–8).
In addition to the terms “Mbum” and “Adamawa 6,” several other labels for this lowerlevel group have been proposed: “Lakka,” and more recently, “Kebi-Sanaga” and “KebiBenue.” Boyd (1974:17–8), followed by Ubels and Ubels (1980:1–3), uses the term
“Lakka.” However, in a later work (1989) Boyd reverts to the term “Mbum” due to the
imprecise and possibly pejorative nature of the term “Lakka.” Later suggestions
informally put forward by Boyd (pers. comm. 2004) are “Mbumoid” and “Southwestern.”","[31, 32]"

form may be used with no change in meaning. Variation between the forms is likely
sociolinguistic rather than linguistic, reflecting a process of contraction that is taking

Members of a set of reflexive object pronouns are used whenever the object of a simple
clause is co-referential with its subject. Similar to what is found in many other African
languages (Watters 2000:213), reflexive object pronouns in Mambay are composed of the
noun )ínù ‘body, self’ and an inalienable possessive pronoun (6.1.4.2). Reflexive object
pronouns are as follows:

semantic participants in a transitive verb construction. However, they achieve this using
different strategies: while reflexive suffixes result in the detransitivization of a transitive
verb (7.3.2.1.2), reflexive object pronouns satisfy transitivity requirements by supplying
the transitive verb with an object. The detransitivization strategy is only moderately277productive and is often accompanied by semantic shift (7.3.2.1.2), but the use of reflexive
objects is fully productive.

"512.1.5 Internal structure of consonants
Two categories of consonants, both of which employ complex articulations, show signs
of internal structure: glottalic consonants % Q Nw Nm Nn N7, which exhibit a secondary
glottalic articulation (2.1.5.1), and labial-velar stops kp gb, which exhibit double
articulation (2.1.5.2). The labial-velar approximant w, which has no stop quality, does
not pattern with these consonants.
2.1.5.1 Glottalic consonants
There are four indicators of internal complexity for glottalic consonants, that is,
consonants with secondary glottalic articulation Nm Nn N7
% Q Nw. Three of these
indicators are distributional and the other is based on morphophonological evidence.
Morpheme-internally, these consonants are never found after long vowels (2.3.1.2), nor
are they found in the second position of a morpheme-internal consonant cluster (2.1.2.6).
Additionally, they are never geminated (2.1.2.7). Finally, when a glottalic consonant is
found morpheme-initially, any long vowel which precedes it in the utterance is
phonetically shortened. This suggests that, given an appropriate environment, the
glottalic element of the preglottalized segment associates with the coda position of the
previous syllable.

1SG:NONPFV.NEG take:FUT NEG

The evidence for the complex internal structure of doubly-articulated labial-velar stops
kp gb is weaker, since their relegation to morpheme-initial position (2.1.2.1) limits the
contexts in which they may display internal complexity. However, consider the
following example:52tí4kpâ4kpàr4)áàwheatear (bird sp.) (cf. )áà bean)This example is ideophonic (5.11, 8.2) and probably shows reduplication (5.11.2) of the
syllable kpar. There are two difficulties with this word. First, it shows a pattern of
segmental reduplication that differs from other patterns in the lexicon, such as those
found in the following comparable words:
lè74lé74gérmù
tí4kéé4kèèrúkingfisher sp. (cf. gérmù women)
firefly (cf. kéè brilliant, intense (red))The reduplication of the onset and nucleus of kpar rather than the whole syllable is
surprising, since there are no other examples where this template is applied (reduplication
of whole syllable rhymes is, in contrast, common; see 8.4.2.1). However, the fact that kp
does not occur in non morpheme-initial position elsewhere in the data suggests that there
is indeed a morpheme boundary before both occurrences of kp in tí4kpâ4kpàr4)áà,
attributable to a morphological phenomenon such as reduplication. The question
remains, then, as to why the r of kpar is not reduplicated along with the rest of the
syllable.
A promising resolution to this puzzle is the recognition of internal structural complexity
for the labial-velar kp in Mambay, as has been described in other languages (Clements
and Hume 1995; Kutsch Lojenga 1994:47ff.). When kp is viewed as complex, it helps
explain the obstruction to the reduplication of r along with the rest of the syllable kpar:
the coda position in the preceding syllable is thus dominated by the k portion of the kp
from the second syllable. This situation may be represented as follows:
σσσσCVXCVXCVXCVX= k p
kp a r + kp a rkp a rkp a rattested in: tí4kpâ4kpàr4)áà ‘wheatear (bird sp.)’
Although no similar evidence has been observed for gb, there is no reason to posit an
internal structure differing from that of kp, since a double articulation is characteristic of
both consonants.","[68, 69, 70]"

7.4.1.1.1.2 Perfect
The Perfect tense is used for previously completed events with consequences for a point
in time contemporaneous with the sequence of events in a discourse (typically the
present). It is structured differently for intransitive and transitive verbs. For intransitive
verbs and detransitivized transitive verbs (7.3.2.1), reflexive suffixes are used:
subject pronoun +verbRealis pronoun (CV) stem (Perfect tone (see 7.3.2.2.3)) + reflexive suffix
ex. mì hèè4ní
I have climbed
1SG climb:PERF-1SG.REFL
rò hèè4ró
you (pl.) have climbed
2PL climb:PERF-REFL-2PL.REFL343For typical transitive verbs, a Perfect suffix 4rì (7.3.1.3) is used:

stem and a H suffix; * = replacive melody, i.e., dominates the entire verb word; see
7.3.2.2.3.)
Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. As is evident, the tonal nature of
Perfect forms in some tonal classes is complex: while Class 1 (CVX intransitive only)
and Class 2 exhibit a floating H tone on the left boundary of the verb word, some other
Classes (4, transitive only; 5; and 6) exhibit a replacive melody that applies to the Perfect
verb word as a whole. The tonal behaviour of these forms is reviewed in 7.3.2.2.3.
There is no negative form of the Perfect; negated Perfect constructions use negative
perfective forms (7.5.1).
7.4.1.1.1.3 Pluperfect
The Pluperfect tense is used for previously completed events with consequences for a
point in time subsequent to the event but prior to the point of reference in a discourse.
The Pluperfect is found with intransitive verbs as well as transitive verbs that take
reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2). It is typically structured as follows:
subject pronoun +verbIndicative pronoun (CV) stem (Pluperfect tone) + reflexive suffix
ex. mì Qáá4ní
I had moved away
1SG move.away:PLUPERF-1SG.REFL
rò Qáá4ró

mì Qáà4ní
I have moved away
1SG move.away:PERF-1SG.REFL
rò Qáà4ró
you (pl.) have moved away
2PL move.away:PERF-2PL.REFL
As is the case with the basic Perfective (7.4.1.1.1.1) and Perfect (7.4.1.1.1.2), third person
singular and plural forms (excluding co-referential forms) of the Perfect are marked with
a zero pronoun.

A distinction between Perfect and Pluperfect exists only for intransitive verbs from tonal

discussion.)
Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. Negated forms of the Pluperfect
are discussed in 7.5.
7.4.1.1.2 Imperfective
The Imperfective is used for events which, in reference to a given point in time, happen
but are not completed. In addition to carrying a generic imperfective meaning, it often
communicates a habitual meaning. Usually the events are anchored in the present, but as
the example at the end of this section shows, they may be expressed as events in the past.
Represented by a single tense, the Imperfective is typically expressed simply by using a
Realis subject pronoun (6.1.2) with a verbal noun (5.9). As is explained in the section on
verbal nouns, a comparable situation is found in the well-known case of Hausa
(Dimmendaal 2000:171, Newman 2000:288–92) and in Kebi-Benue languages such as
Mundang (Elders 2000:327–30).","[359, 360, 361, 362, 363]"
"The verb vè ‘go’ (7.3.3.1) and detransitivized verb stems (7.3.2.1.2) are exceptional in
that their Optative forms are always found with reflexive suffixes (see also Appendix 2).

"15Elders (2000:10) has argued that the term “Kebi-Sanaga” would be preferable to “Mbum”
since it avoids the confusion caused by a single label (“Mbum”) which applies to both a
language family and a member of that family; additionally, it follows the Niger-Congo
convention of naming language families after rivers (cf. Williamson 1989:18–20). In a
later statement, issued after discussion with other scholars working in the language
family, he refines the term as “Kebi-Benue” (Elders 2006). In addition to sharing the
stated advantages of “Kebi-Sanaga,” this term is geographically appropriate, since most
of the languages in the group fall within the basins of the Kebi and Benue rivers. Finally,
it has the appeal of posterity: Mouchet proposed the term “Kabi-Benwe” for a group
containing a number of the same languages as the family under discussion as early as
1938 (1.2.2.1). Because of these reasons, the term “Kebi-Benue” has been used in this
study.
1.2.2.3 Internal structure of Kebi-Benue
Academic understanding of the genetic relationship among languages of the Kebi-Benue
family is still inadequate. Unfortunately, most of the classifications proposed have been
impressionistic rather than methodical.
The first major contribution to the internal classification of Kebi-Benue is that of Boyd
(1974), who shows a close relationship among many of the languages. Although it does
not include the whole group, Boyd’s (1974) classification of Kebi-Benue is unique in that
it is the only study in which satisfactory comparative evidence has been provided for a
large portion of the group. Although some of the northern Kebi-Benue languages
(including Mambay) signalled by Greenberg (1963:9) are absent from Boyd’s
classificatory comments, he divides the rest of the group into two divisions: Eastern
(“oriental”), which is composed of languages closely related to the major language
Mbum, and Western (“occidental”), which accounts for the other languages under
investigation. The Eastern languages are further divided into two sub-groups, “type
Pandjama” and “type ndó mbàlì” (1974:17).
The next major attempt at classification of Kebi-Benue is that of Ubels and Ubels (1980).
While following Boyd’s general Eastern/Western structure, a number of languages
passed over by Boyd (1974) are accounted for. Mundang and Kali are placed in the
Western division; the languages of the Eastern division are revised in terms of inventory,
names, and internal classification; and several unclassified languages are added (Ubels
and Ubels 1980:5). Mambay, however, is once again omitted from the discussion.
Dieu and Renaud (1983:359) alter the internal classification of Kebi-Benue with the
addition of a Northern division. Importantly, Mambay is recognized as a Kebi-Benue
language and is included in this division along with Tupuri and Mundang. The remainder
of Kebi-Benue languages are relegated to a single Southern division.
Although Boyd (1989a) cites Ubels and Ubels (1980) as his primary authority, his
classification diverges from theirs in some respects. He splits the Kebi-Benue family into
three divisions: Northern, Central and Southern. Boyd’s Northern division accounts for
the languages found in Dieu and Renaud’s (1983:359) new Northern division, but differs16in that it subsumes the remainder of Ubels and Ubels’ Western languages: Dama, Galke
(Ndai)/Pormi, and Kali. His Central and Southern divisions correspond to the two
branches of Ubels and Ubels’ (1980) Eastern division, but in contrast are seen as primary
divisions within Kebi-Benue. Boyd’s (1989a) resulting classification is thus as follows:
A. Northern
1. Tupuri, Mundang, Mambay
2. Dama, Galke (Ndáí)/Pormi, Kali
B. Central
1. Koh [Kuo], Sakpu
2. Karang, Pana, Njak Mbai, Ngumi, Kãr
C. Southern: Mbum, Mbere, Kpere ~ Kepere
Unclassified languages: Pondo, Gonge, Tale, Dek
Stefan Elders (2000:8–9) accepts this classification of Kebi-Benue for the most part, but
makes the important observation that Kpam/Mono has been accidentally (“fortuitement”)
omitted and places it in along with Mundang as a separate node of Kebi-Benue’s first
Northern group (Tupuri-Mundang-Mambay).
Elders (2006) provides a comprehensive overview of issues in the classification of the
Kebi-Benue group. In addition to cataloguing research which has been done in the
languages, a history of classification of Kebi-Benue is given and a number of corrections
of and additions to Boyd’s (1989a) inventory are offered. Importantly, Gikaw is added
and assigned to the same subgroup as Kpam/Mono, and Man and Tali (Tale) are included
in the Southern division (but cf. Davis and Seguin 1990:33–4).
Final modifications accepted in the present study are the placement of Gonge as a variety
of Njak Mbay, and Pondo as a variety of Pana (Davis and Seguin 1990:35, cf. Elders
2006). Considering the discussion in the present section and the sources to which it
refers, the following provisional classification of Kebi-Benue is offered:

1.2.2.4 Controversy over Mambay’s position within Kebi-Benue
Notwithstanding a widespread acceptance of the Kebi-Benue group, the status of
Mambay within this group has been questioned on several occasions. While such
perspectives do not reflect the thrust of the comparative literature in general (1.2.2.3),
they are maintained here as residue since all arguments for Mambay’s position have up to
this point been supported with little data.
Samarin (1971) attributes Mambay’s categorization within Kebi-Benue to undue
geographical considerations and recommends a revision. He states:18Fali, Mangbei and Mundang, although not at all closely related, are all found in the
same geographical area…. On the basis of his own linguistic observations, de
Waard (pers. comm.) supports the integrity of this [Kebi-Benue] group with the
exception of Mangbei. Since Stennes (pers. comm.) considers Mangbei to be
closer to Fali (Group 9) [sic: Fali is Greenberg’s Group 11] than it is to Mundang
of this group, it would seem that Mangbei may indeed have to be excluded. (217)Hagège (1981) supports the view that Mambay should be excluded from the Kebi-Benue
group. Although Hagège makes reference to “une information complémentaire,” he does
not provide evidence for this decision; he states simply that Mambay is too different from
the other languages of the Kebi-Benue group to be attached to it (1981:4).
Bennett (1983:33, 42) implicitly acknowledges this position by calling the Kebi-Benue
group “Mangbei-Mbum,” but Mambay is not investigated as part of his sample for
classification.
Based on a bare 10% apparent lexical similarity (among 227 words) between Mambay
and Mundang, Hamm (2001:6, 10) concludes that while Mambay may belong to the
Kebi-Benue group, it is likely that it should be excluded from the Tupuri-MundangMambay subgroup.
In contrast to these sources, and in keeping with other classifications starting with
Westermann (1952; see 1.2.2.1–1.2.2.3), Boyd (1989a) accepts that Mambay belongs to
the Northern division of the Kebi-Benue group. Reflecting on his previous comparative
work in the Adamawa languages (1974, 1978a), he responds skeptically to the exclusion
of Mambay from the Kebi-Benue group, claiming that no evidence has been presented to
support such a claim:
A doubt was raised about the classification of Mangbai by Samarin (1971) for
reasons that are unclear. Early word lists published by Strümpell (1910) and Lukas
(1937) reveal a clearly, if distantly, related language. Eguchi’s (1971) publication
confirms this impression. (185)Boyd’s (1989a) resulting classification presents Mambay within the Northern division of
Kebi-Benue. Elders (2000, 2006) tentatively reiterates this position.
Given these hesitations, an in-depth comparison of Mambay with other members of the
Northern division of Kebi-Benue is needed to clarify the relationship among these
languages.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
"201.2.3.2 Domains of use of Mambay
As the previous section indicates, languages other than Mambay are used primarily in
situations where members of other ethnic groups are present, and in domains where
written languages are used.
Among Mambay speakers, the only place where another language is used in an oral
domain is in conversation in and around the mosque; until recently, only Fulfulde has
been permitted (Moussa Taw, pers. comm. 2005/6).
Recently, the use of Mambay has expanded into several new domains: religious services
and conversation, radio and writing. Changes in language use in religious services and
conversation are addressed in the previous section (1.2.3.1). As concerns radio,
COLAMA (Comité de Langue Mambay) has sponsored a weekly radio program in
Mambay since mid-2005.
However, the most important expansion of Mambay has been the development of a
writing system (see 1.3.3). As has been the case for other ethnic groups in the area, it has
opened a major avenue for the Mambay to assert themselves as a people, and has acted as
a catalyst for the expansion of the other domains mentioned here.
To date, numerous written materials have appeared in Mambay (transcriptions for titles in
the lists below are given as they appear on the materials). The first publication in
Mambay was a probably a catechism and prayer service, which the Catholic Church
produced. A recent revision of the prayer service has been reproduced by COLAMA in
conjunction with the Catholic Church and SIL.

On its own, COLAMA has published a calendar, and for the past few years has regularly
produced schedules, reports and minutes for language committee meetings.
Oral texts transcribed by COLAMA in conjunction with SIL in the context of narrative
discourse workshops, named with their oral sources, are as follows:

1.2.3.3 Dialect situation
There is little linguistic variation among varieties of Mambay, and the variation that
exists does not significantly impede comprehension between speakers of different
varieties (Hamm 2001:9).
Three main dialect areas, which constitute links in a modest continuum, have been
identified. Varieties south of the Mayo Kebbi are at one end of the continuum, and those
in Chad, which are in the north-eastern part of the language area, are at the other end.
Varieties in the north-western section of the language area, situated north of the Mayo
Kebbi in Cameroon, are ambivalent in their affinities to the dialects at the ends of the
continuum. 20th-century migrations have disrupted this neat distribution, so that two of
the villages north of the Mayo Kebbi (Bisooli~Bissolé and Kaaguma~Kagouma) speak a
“southern” dialect, and a village south of the river (Kaaku’~Kakou) speaks a “northern”
dialect. According to some sources, the variety spoken on the south side of Mambay
Mountain, from Pyahga (Piaga) to Lam, constitutes an additional dialect area. However,
it has not been possible to gather data from this variety.
Most of the dialect differences are lexical, and are often limited to tone, nasality or a
single segment. In the database, these differences affect only about 1% of the lexicon. A
representative selection of attested variations grouped by dialect area is given in Figure 5
(see following page):23Figure 5: Lexical variation among Mambay dialects

ráhnàIn addition to lexical variants, two regionally defined phonological differences have been
identified. The most important difference concerns the inventory of nasalized vowels.
While the other dialects exhibit three peripheral nasalized vowel positions i a u (2.2.1,
3.1), the dialect in Chad also allows nasalized mid vowels, at least on the surface. This
shows up in the linked forms of yaX- and waX-final nouns (5.2.2.2.2):

exhibits nasalized vowels in seven positions (Elders 2000:40).
Another conspicuous difference exhibited by the dialect in Chad as against the other
dialects is its realization of s and z as [L] and [M] respectively with the semivowel y or,
with some speakers, before the high front vowel i.","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"

dummy object suffix 4na (7.3.1.4) and they are never derived from other verbs or nouns
(cf. 7.1.2.1). Intransitive verbs are frequently found with reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2); for
some tenses, inflection with reflexive suffixes is obligatory (7.4.1.1.1).

Importantly, when such complements are nouns, there is no marking on the complement
to show that it is an oblique rather than an object (objects are also unmarked; see the
extended discussion in 5.13). Example locative complements are as follows:

the verb elsewhere, since in other contexts it shows the formal characteristics of the
intransitive verbs mentioned in this section.
Intransitive verbs are effectively transitivized by the application of the causative verbal
extension 4n (7.2.3.1).

Transitive verbs are almost always found with a nominal (or pronominal) object, a
dummy object suffix, or a reflexive suffix. Transitive verbs found with objects are shown
in the following examples:

In contrast to intransitive verbs, which are only found with corresponding irregular verbal
nouns (5.9.1.2), regular verbal nouns (5.9.1.1) always correspond to transitive verbs.","[342, 343, 344]"
"7.2.3 Synchronically productive verbal extensions
7.2.3.1 Causative 4n
The extension 4n is the most productive verbal extension in Mambay, and contributes a
causative meaning to the stems in which it is found. (An alternative causative
construction formed by means of the auxiliary verb pá ‘make, do’ is presented in 7.6.3).
When it is applied to a verb stem ending in a long vowel other than a glottalized vowel, it
is added to the existing heavy root syllable, thereby making it superheavy (2.4.3):
hèènT lift
làànT feedcf. hèè climb, go up
cf. làà eat
306sàhnT cause to rest
cf. sàh rest
vììnT frighten, threaten
cf. víí fear
QàànT cause to move away cf. Qáá move away
When 4n is applied to a stem that ends with a glottalized vowel (V’), this vowel is
reinterpreted as a V)V sequence: the glottal stop is discrete, and the second vowel, which
is syllabic, echoes the first.
sà)án sell
tù)ún teachcf. sá’ buy
cf. tú’ show, teachWhenever 4n is applied to a stem ending in a short vowel, the consonant g and a syllabic
echo vowel are inserted between the stem and the extension.
dògón cause to drink
gègén lose (tr.)cf. dó
cf. gédrink
get lostWhenever 4n is applied to a stem that already ends with g, the syllabic echo vowel is
inserted between the verb root and the extension.
hègén dry (tr.)
lùgún cause to leavecf. hég dry up
cf. lúg go outWhenever it is applied to a stem that ends with any other consonant, it is realized as 4ni.
àrní heal (tr.)
)ìnní loadcf. àr get better
cf. )ìn lift, carryOccasionally the function of 4n diverges from its prototypical use as a causative
morpheme. In each case, however, some sort of semantic association between the root
and the stem which has been extended with 4n is still evident.
dùùnT reveal
kàhnT tip over
nàhnT drag
tù)ún teachcf. dùù shout, squeak, humiliate
cf. káh like, ask, tip over
cf. náh take out
cf. tú’ show, teachA second verbal extension 4n, which behaves differently and whose semantic value is
indistinct, is discussed in 7.2.4.5.
7.2.3.2 Iterative/intensive 4ri
4ri is another highly productive verbal extension. It typically contributes an iterative or
intensive semantic value to the stems in which it is found; still, additional specific
meanings brought about by the lexicalization of these stems are common. Its relation to307the intensive extension 4r and to the iterative/intensive extension 4gi is described in detail
in (7.2.6).
The distribution of 4ri is phonologically restricted; it is never attached to verb stems
which end in an alveolar consonant or 47. Verbs containing 4ri include the following:

4gi is a third highly productive verbal extension. Like 4ri, it typically contributes an
iterative or intensive semantic value to the stems in which it is found, and additional
specific meanings brought about by the lexicalization of these stems are common. Its
relation to the extensive extension 4g and to the iterative/intensive extension 4ri is
described in detail in 7.2.6.
The distribution of 4gi is phonologically restricted in that it never attaches to verb stems
ending with g. Verbs containing 4gi include the following:

cf. sáá
cf. làmcough, break something soft

braid (rope), compress
tell, trick, finish
prepare hot peanut drink7.2.4 Other verbal extensions
In addition to synchronically productive verbal extensions (7.2.3), there appear to be a
number of other extensions which have applied historically. A few of these extensions
are moderately well-attested and, in some cases, the identification of a common meaning
can be attempted (7.2.4.1–7.2.4.4). Others are poorly attested; their historical
involvement in verbal derivation has been discriminated in reference to their tonal and (in
most cases) segmental structure (7.2.4.5; see also 7.3.2.2) (cf. Dimmendaal 2000:182).
7.2.4.1 4r
The extension 4r prototypically intensifies the meaning of the stems in which it is found.
For a discussion of the relationship between 4r and 4ri, see 7.2.6. Examples of stems
containing 4r include:308dèr

cf. gìì
cf. hàà
cf. háá
cf. náá
cf. zààcut
answer, accept, admit
come back, go back
squeeze

cross7.2.4.2 4g
Verb stems which contain the extension 4g prototypically signal actions in which things
spread out; this is reminiscent of the “extensive” extension whose meaning is described
Schadeberg (1994) and whose contribution to verb stems in Mundang is presented in
Elders (2000:176–9). For a discussion of the relationship between 4g and 4gi, see 7.2.6.
Examples of stems containing 4g include:
nìg

cf. níí
sweep clean, plunder cf. táá
elude, avoid
cf. vbíí
straddle, sling
cf. ráá
suck
cf. Nwáá
refuse, divorce
cf. zààdefecate
stir
cut
spread out
split
cross7.2.4.3 4l
The extension 4l is moderately productive. Formally, it resembles the “separative”
extension l in Mundang which Elders (2000:174), based on the definition provided in
Schadeberg (1982b:61), sees as describing movement away from an original position or
state. Synchronically, however, this semantic value is not fully transparent in Mambay,
nor is it completely consistent. Verb stems containing 4l include the following:
ùl
divide
dwàhl shoot several times
kìl
wander
vbìl boil furiously, hack
zàl
explain
zòl
leavecf. úú
cf. dwáh
cf. kíí
cf. vbìì
cf. zàà
cf. zóócreate, sprout
shoot, sting
set in motion
cut, cut up
cross, pull
rise, greet7.2.4.4 4zi
The extension 4zi is modestly productive. It is formally similar to other plural
morphemes, which contain z or zi (cf. 5.5, 5.9.2.1, 7.3.1.1); semantically, the data allow
that it could have originated as a pluractional extension. Normally, pluractional
extensions signal a plurality of verbal action; this may be performed by several agents or
experienced by several patients or instruments, or it may be an action performed in
several places (Newman 1990:53ff., Elders 2000:183). Verb stems containing 4zi include
the following:309lùgzí
nìhzí
zì’zí
)ìhzíresemble
approach with intention
nibble in several places
wipe off excrementcf. lúg
cf. níh
cf. zìr
cf. )ìhgo out, sprout
(happen) to approach
gnaw
gruntThe fact that the verbal extension 4zi is distinct from the verbal plural morpheme 4zí
(7.3.1.1) is demonstrated by their distribution in the following set of words:
lúg
he/she/it went out
lùgzí he/she/it resembledlúgzí
he/she/it went out
lùgzìzí they resembled7.2.4.5 Unproductive verbal extensions
The unproductive verbal extensions listed here are more difficult to establish than those
found above. There are numerous cases of formally and semantically similar correlate
verbs from which they may have been derived historically, but not as many as for
productive extensions. Still, the inventory of unproductive extensions given here serves
(at least) as a catalogue of forms which are like the more obvious verbal extensions of the
same shape in their non-canonical tone melody (Class 5) and, usually, segmental
composition (especially that of the coda). Unproductive extensions which are marked
segmentally include: 4n (#2), 4%, 4b, 4Nm, 4m, 47 and 4Nw. There also appears to be one
unproductive extension marked with glottalization, and one marked only by a tonal
alternation.
The extension 4n (#2) shares its segmental shape with the causative extension 4n
(7.2.3.1). However, it does not contribute a uniformly causative semantic value, nor does
it increase the segmental content of the verb (7.2.1). Verb stems containing 4n (#2)
include the following:

nàNw spankThe following verb may contain a glottalization extension 4 ’:

verbs (cf. 7.3.2.2; see also Elders 2000:183 for a similar situation):
gwà’ disappear
gwàà rob
gyàà care for a child
syàà diminish
Qàà finishcf. gwá’ laugh
(no similar root)
cf. gyáá take out, gather up
(no similar root)
cf. Qáá move awayOnly the five verbs listed above appear to contain a tonal verbal extension. A point
worth noting is that the onset in the first four verb stems is complex (cf. 2.3.3.1), and that
the fifth stem starts with a complex (preglottalized) palatal consonant (cf. 2.1.5).
However, no further conclusion has been reached concerning a relation between these
structures and the tonal verbal extension.","[323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328]"

dream of Africa and made it come true; and to Tinaga Parisa and Kyahrimi Nisse, my
hot-blooded little Mambay girls.
The present research on Mambay was conducted for a doctoral programme in the
Department of African Languages and Cultures at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
Fieldwork was funded within the context of a language development consultancy jointly
administered by SIL Chad and SIL Cameroon. Authorization for field research was
granted by MINREST (the Ministère de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique) of
Cameroon, permit 006/MINREST/B00/D00/D11.
I wish to thank my colleagues at Leiden University for their insight, humour, and
encouragement, in particular Christian Rapold, Maarten Kossmann, and K’es Mulugeta
Seyoum.
I thank my colleagues of SIL Chad and SIL Cameroon, many of whom contributed in
specific ways to the success this research and the enjoyment of our work together: Padeu
Dakouli, Diane Friesen, Marti Giger, Caroline Grant, Jeff Heath, Jérémie Mondy Mégay,
Julien Tchékoua, Bruce Jakeway, Gideon Noussi, Edward and Diane Tong, and Liz
Williams. Discussions on a wide range of linguistic topics with Jim Roberts, Lukas
Neukom and Richard Gravina were constructive. Vaughn and Mary Ohlman helped us
greatly during times of sickness.
I appreciated academic exchange with many other people working in the field.
Assessments of aspects of the present research by Roger Blench, John Esling, Ken Olson,
Cho Jun-Mo and Gordon Tisher were beneficial. In particular, Stefan Elders (deceased)
did all he could to ensure that I was well-prepared for fieldwork on Mambay by
furnishing me with numerous resources which would have been otherwise difficult to
locate, by sharing his own field notes on Mambay, by involving me in his other works-inprogress in the field of Adamawa languages. Paul Eguchi similarly laid the foundation
for the present research through his previous work on Mambay, and encouraged me to
engage in this field of study. I also thank Keith Snider for fostering in me a sense of
wonder and love of language, especially in the areas of phonology and tone, and so for
inspiring me to pursue further studies in African linguistics. His comments on the tone
chapter of the present research were invaluable.iiAu Cameroun, nous avons apprécié l’accueil que nous avons reçu dans chaque secteur.
Nous reconnaissons les administrateurs tels que le préfet de Guider, le sous-préfet de
Guider, le sous-préfet de Figuil et son adjoint. En plus, nous avons apprécié la sécurité
qu’ont pourvue la gendarmerie et le poste de police de Figuil.
D’autres personnes qui ont enrichi notre séjour à Figuil sont nos frères de la congrégation
EFL à Figuil, les pères à la mission catholique de Figuil (en particulier le père Vladislav),
le patron de Figuil Pierre Roca, et le directeur de l’École de Kolléré.
Parmi les Mambay, nous avons connu un accueil chaleureux depuis le premier moment.
En effet, le pays mambay nous est devenu un foyer. Les chefs des villages mambay nous
ont ouvert la porte au peuple : nous nous sommes présentés devant les chefs de Beepahna
(Biparé), Kaakaala (Kakala), Kaakyo’w (Katchéo), Kaaku’ (Kakou), Bisooli (Bissolé) et
Kaaguma (Kagouma), et nous avons reçu leur bénédiction. D’autres chefs nous ont
accueillis depuis leurs sièges.
Arrivés au pays mambay, c’était d’abord chez Swahy Kada Moïse que nous nous sommes
installés. Il nous à considéré comme ses enfants, et pour nos propres enfants il était
dazwa’ ‘grand-père.’ Nous le remercions pour son partage de lui-même et de sa famille.
C’était un grand privilège de pouvoir travailler avec la direction (ancienne et nouvelle)
de COLAMA (Comité de langue mambay) y compris Kam Kaagbungni et Moussa Tao,
et avec ses membres, en particulier Oussoumanou Bouba, Kwe Nathaniel, Koué Agabus,
Bégui Démas et Bouba Robert. J’ai apprécié aussi l’aide de Tao Justin et de Peevina
Salomon dans l’apprentissage de la langue.
Nos voisins à Kaakaala et à Figuil étaient pour nous un support et une grande joie : Saadu
Kami Taw, Younoussa Wouri, Kada Kaakaala, Amina Beezwa’ et sa famille, Adoum
Kami, Barnabas et Tigam Kaakaala, Parna paaru Samson, Napuga, Haman Kaakaala,
Njidda Robert, et les grands parmi les Mambay qui se rassemblèrent saa napuga chez
Kami Koué. En plus, nous étions à l’aise parmi nos frères de l’église à Kaakaala et avec
leur catéchiste.
Je remercie aussi ceux que nous connaissions hors du pays mambay. À N’Djaména, nous
avons eu le plaisir de connaître Oumarou Beïki, Abassi Moustapha, Mohamadou
Maouarmi et tous les membres du Comité des Ressortissants du Canton de Beepahna
(Biparé). À Maroua, Issa Haman et Souahibou Kassala m’ont orienté avec justesse.
C’est à Oussoumanou Bouba que je réserve un remerciement tout particulier. Il est
quelqu’un qui vit selon le proverbe, « Ku’l za’ ah paa bin, muu zyagri i am » ‘Si tu
apprends la danse du pied d’un autre, tu tromperas le tien.’ Cette individualité, ferme et
parfois rigide, lui a permis pourtant de se donner sans vacillation à la promotion de sa
langue pour l’honneur de ses parents et pour l’héritage des ses enfants et de son peuple.
Nous avons connu ensemble une collaboration enrichissante, et j’espère donc que j’ai pu,
en revanche, l’aider à réaliser ses propres aspirations. En ce qui concerne notre
cheminement divergeant, je lui affirme qu’il n’y aura pas un autre comme lui, puisqueiii« Heega hii haa saa fi naale ya » ‘Un couteau ne peut pas rentrer dans le fourreau de
son collègue.’
Finalement, je dis au peuple mambay, ri zoori ro! Nous vous saluons! Kiswa! Nous
vous remercions! Comme « Tuh bom hii marva ya » ‘Un seul bracelet ne fait aucun
bruit,’ que vous vous épanouissiez dans un esprit d’entente mutuelle. La’ fah kaa fuu

"5.5 Plural formation
In Mambay, morphologically explicit pluralization is compatible with a large
proportion—well over half—of nouns. Limitations on the application of pluralization are
discussed in 5.5.1. Pluralization strategies, which are based on a morphological template,
are outlined in 5.5.2. Collective constructions, which provide an alternative means of
signalling semantic plurality on nouns, are discussed in 5.6.
Productive plural constructions associated with verbs and ideophonic modifiers are
discussed in the relevant sections (7.3.1.1 and 8.5.1).",[219]

2SG get.cold:PFV-2SG.REFL
When attached to a stem ending with a glottalized vowel (V’), this vowel is reinterpreted
as a V)V sequence: the glottal stop is discrete, and the second vowel, which is syllabic,
echoes the first.

2SG sleep:PLUPERF-2SG.REFL
This includes mid vowels, which are restricted from bearing nasality in most contexts (cf.
3.1.1). This suggests that the mid quality of the vowel and/or its nasality may be an
effect of its phonetic context rather than an underlying trait.

7.3.1.2.2 r-initial reflexive suffixes
When an r-initial reflexive suffix is suffixed to a verb stem ending in r, the resulting
r+r sequence is shortened to a single r.

When nasal-initial reflexive suffixes follow a stem-final oral sonorant
% or l, the
nasality of the pronoun assimilates to the left and the stem-final oral sonorant is realized
as the respective nasal counterpart Nm Nn or n (cf. 3.4.3.2).

The suffix 4rì is only found on transitive verbs (7.3.2.1.2), where it marks the Perfect
tense (7.4.1.1.1.2). Often, Perfect forms with 4rì are found without an explicit object;
this suggests that 4rì satisfies (or at least relieves) transitivity requirements.
mì làà4rì
1SG eat:PERF-PERFI have eaten (something)319mì póó4rì
1SG pay:PERF-PERFI have payed (something)The suffix 4rì cannot be treated as a dummy object, however, since it allows an

The suffix 4na is a dummy object marker which is found with verbal nouns derived from
transitive verbs, whether they are used as nouns (5.9) or used verbally (as in the
Imperfective; see 7.4.1.1.2).
làá4nà

7.3.1.5 Pronominal object suffixes
Three object pronouns are verb word suffixes: second person singular (7.3.1.5.1), third
person singular (7.3.1.5.2), and the 4zíná variant of the 1&2 person plural (7.3.1.5.3). In
all three cases, there is morphophonological evidence of these suffixes’ interdependence
with the verb word; such evidence is lacking for other object pronouns (6.1.3.1).
7.3.1.5.1 The second person singular object suffix -mi
The second person singular object is a verb word suffix 4mi.
mì zòò4mi
1SG greet:VN-2SG.OBJI greet you / I am greeting you)à kyàh4mi
3SG love:VN-2SG.OBJhe/she/it loves you / he/she/it is loving youWhen 4m is attached to a stem ending with a glottalized vowel (V’), this vowel is
reinterpreted as a V)V sequence: the glottal stop is discrete, and the second vowel, which
is syllabic, echoes the first, although it carries the High tone of the underlying suffix 4mi.
)à là)4ám
3SG hear:VN-2SG.OBJhe/she/it hears you / he/she/it is hearing youWhen 4m is attached to a consonant-final verb stem, an echo vowel is also inserted.

mì kòò4mi

1SG give.birth:VN-2SG.OBJ
However, echo vowels that follow a stem ending in a nasal consonant are nasalized.
)à
àm4ám
3SG trample:VN-2SG.OBJhe/she/it tramples you / he/she/it is trampling youIn this context, mid echo vowels are also nasalized. Like the second person singular
reflexive suffix (7.3.1.2.1), the identity of the suffix vowel and/or its nasality may be an
effect of phonetic context rather than an underlying trait.

3SG wait:VN-2SG.OBJhe/she/it waits for you / he/she/it is waiting for you7.3.1.5.2 The third person singular object suffix 4 `rú
Tonally, the third person singular object suffix 4 `rú (which in informal speech may be
reduced to 4 `wú; see the discussion at the beginning of 6.1.3.1) forms part of the same
word as the verb stem.

The -zíná variant of the 1&2 plural object zìnzá ~ -zíná (see 6.1.3.1) is also a suffix,
since tonally it forms part of the same word as the verb stem.","[334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339]"
"2652. Indicative Irrealis pronouns, which represent the affirmative Indicative
Irrealis (i.e., Future) as well as negative Perfective and negative nonPerfective clauses, share a CVV structure; while the tone melody for the
affirmative Indicative Irrealis and negative Perfective pronouns is HL,
that of the negative non-Perfective pronouns is LH.
3. Optative pronouns exhibit an invariable CV structure, whether affirmative
or negative.

only pronoun category which is always unmarked, and it is significant because third

my grass+However:
1. The designation of y and w as vowels in this context would require an
introduction of vowel diphthongs or non-identical vowel sequences into the
phonology, since none are found unambiguously in the language.
2. Even more problematic is the existence of a marginal contrast in vowel length
after Cy and Cw sequences. CyVV and CwVV syllables are not uncommon. On
the contrary, there are only ten words in the data with CyV and CwV syllables;
and of these, two are borrowed, and at least one is a morphologically complex
77ideophone. Still, in light of certain data (for example: kwérè fence, nà4dwárà7
sore, pimple; vs. gwàárè sickle, gwáàlá thief, robbery), this contrast in vowel
length must be recognized. An interpretation of y and w as V in this context
would therefore necessitate the recognition of three-mora vowels (VVV) syllables
in the phonology, even though there is no evidence for these elsewhere in the
language.
Somewhat more satisfactory is a C (Cy and Cw) interpretation, where y and w are seen as
palatal or labial modifications of consonants. The key argument for this is that syllableinitial consonant clusters are otherwise unattested; with this interpretation, all complex
onsets can be accounted for as single consonants rather than sequences, and no new
syllable types need to be accounted for in the inventory (cf. CV and CC interpretations).
However:
1. Phonetically, y and w typically accompany consonants as an off-glide rather than
as a secondary articulation. That is, the point of greatest palatal and labial closure
is after the release of the accompanied consonant, not with it. The lack of
phonetic connection between the consonant and y or w is even greater in
utterance-final syllables, where y and w are pronounced as vowels (cf. the first
argument in favour of CV above, and 2.1.6.5).
2. y and w may accompany most consonants, including those which are labial
(2.1.2.5). Thus, rather than applying to a limited number of consonantal series
(especially velar consonants), this interpretation would entail the applicability of
palatalization and labialization to the consonant inventory as a whole. While
possible, this is a marked configuration.
3. Complex onsets involving y and w are limited to morpheme-initial position
(2.1.2.5). If the interpretation of these onsets as Cy and Cw were followed, the
relegation of all palatalized and labialized consonants to morpheme-initial
position would lend imbalance to the distributional patterns of consonants in the
language, since codas as well as onsets have rich inventories (2.1.2). However,
because syllabic complexity is typical of morpheme-initial syllables (2.4), it could
be more appropriate to assign y and w to an additional syllable position as in the
third alternative (CC) below.
4. The morphophonological process in which y and w coalesce with adjacent vowels
(given just above and in 5.2.2.2.2) is difficult to explain if y and w are interpreted
as consonantal features. If this were the case, one would expect that in addition to
affecting the following vowels, the palatal or labial feature would remain on the
host consonant. However, it does not; the only remaining indications of y and
w’s presence are the fronting or backing of a following vowel and its raising from
low to mid.
A CC (Cy and Cw) interpretation is also worth considering.
alternative are that:78Arguments for this1. The phonetic realizations of y and w in this position are best represented by this
option (cf. the first arguments presented in favour of CV and C interpretations).
2. Although this interpretation is perhaps less satisfying than a CV interpretation in
explaining the morphophonological process in which y and w coalesce with
adjacent vowels (cf. the second argument in favour of a CV interpretation and the
fourth argument in favour of a C interpretation; see also 5.2.2.2), it is more
convincing than a C interpretation, since the dissociation of the palatal and labial
features from the syllable-initial consonant is not an issue in need of resolution.
Still, in spite of these advantages:
1. Significantly, it requires the recognition of CC-initial syllables in the phonology,
and there are no other kinds of syllable-initial consonant clusters in the language.
Although neither the second (Cy and Cw) nor the third (Cy and Cw) interpretation of
complex onsets is without limitations, both are adequate. Throughout this study, the third
interpretation is used as a basis for transcription and discussion.
2.3.3.2 Pharyngeal articulations
Pharyngeal articulations are contrastive in Mambay, and present a major interpretive
challenge. In examining the issue, topics which have been invoked range from phonetics,
distribution, and syllable structure to the analysis of systematic errors by learners of
Mambay as a written language. Even in light of all these issues, none of the analytical
alternatives is entirely satisfying.
Interpretive possibilities allow that pharyngeal articulations pattern as one of three
structures:
1. an inherent quality of a pharyngeal consonant;
2. an inherent quality of pharyngealized vowels; or
3. a suprasegmental pharyngeal feature which associates with larger units such as
syllable rhymes or syllables.
In the analysis that follows, the distribution and phonetic realizations of pharyngeal
articulations are reviewed (2.3.3.2.1). Evidence for a consonantal interpretation
(2.3.3.2.2) is followed by that which supports a vocalic interpretation (2.3.3.2.3).
Drawbacks to each position are assessed (2.3.3.2.4 and 2.3.3.2.5), and a suprasegmental
interpretation is briefly considered (2.3.3.2.6). The issue is concluded in 2.3.3.2.7.
2.3.3.2.1 Distribution and phonetic realizations
Pharyngeal articulations are primarily associated with syllable rhymes, although the
articulatory effect of pharyngealization sometimes extends to onset consonants (2.1.6.3).
Phonetically, such articulations exhibit both vocalic and consonantal qualities. Because
an understanding of the phonetic situation contributes toward an interpretation,79realizations will be described here in each of the three contexts in which they occur: non
utterance-final open syllables, utterance-final open syllables, and closed syllables.
In an utterance-final syllable which is otherwise open, the only realization which is
attested is a pharyngealized vowel followed by a voiceless pharyngeal fricative
component.
f[á U]pathIn a non utterance-final syllable which is otherwise open, a pharyngeal articulation is
realized with at least a pharyngealized vowel. In some cases, it is realized with an
accompanying pharyngeal fricative component, which is itself optionally voiced. In
addition, an open transition consisting of a pharyngealized echo vowel optionally follows
the fricative component in this position. (Transcriptions are arranged from slow, careful
speech to fast, casual speech).
f[á g]là ~ f[á ag ]là ~ f[á g]là ~ f[á ga ]là ~ f[á ]làfrog sp.","[94, 95, 96, 97]"
"The possibility that the pair 7m / )7m (6) underlies the realizations [7w] [)7w] as well as
[w]] [)w]] should be regarded with caution because there are no examples of underlyingly
nasal consonants in the language which lose their oral closure (resulting in realizations
like [w]] [)w]]) any environment.
While (in contrast to y) there is no morphophonological evidence that proves that [w]] is a
realization of w in a nasal context, there is one morphophonological process in which
[7w] ~ [w]] behaves like the consonant w: namely, when w is found before a back vowel
as the result of its morphological context, it alternates with h as follows (see 5.2.2.2.1):
[7w]áà +
chief)íí
1SG.POSShúù )íí
my chiefwáà
fig)íí
1SG.POSShóò )íí
my fig+Since this process reveals that [7w] is subject to the same constraints as w in a particular
context, it is not unlikely that [7w] is w underlyingly. Intuitively, the transformation of
[7w] into h in this process seems less plausible than that of w into h, since between [7w]
and h an additional difference in nasal value needs to be accounted for.
In the end, arguments for the contrastive status of the nasals \ N\ 7w and N7w are not
convincing. Such a decision would add complexity to the consonant inventory without
simplifying the analysis of other aspects of the phonology. Additionally, the distinction
between these nasals and their nasalized semivowel counterparts (shown above) would
remain unclear. Nor is the alternative analysis of these segments as the sequences ny Nny
7w and N7w a viable possibility for the consonant sequences 7w and N7w because, as
stated earlier, 7 and N7 are never found in onset position without labialization. The
limitation of this interpretation to ny and Nny would therefore introduce asymmetry into
the system by treating palatal semivowels differently than labial-velar semivowels in
reference to nasality. In contrast, an analysis where nasalized semivowels are preferred
can account for all aspects of the data. For these reasons, palatal and labialized velar
nasals [\] and [7w] have been excluded from the consonant inventory in the present
study, and have been analyzed as realizations of palatal and labial-velar semivowels y
and w in the context of nasality.",[68]
"7.5.3 Negative subject pronouns
In addition to being marked by negative particles (7.5.2), verbal negation is marked on
Indicative subject pronouns (6.1.2). Negative Indicative pronouns exhibit the CVV shape
which distinguishes Irrealis verb forms, but their tonal value varies: negative Perfective
verb forms are LH, and negative non-Perfective (negated Imperfective and Future) forms
are HL.

TAM adverbs constitute an open set, and there is no clear boundary between TAM
adverbs and other adverbs (8.1). In addition to a majority of morphologically simple
adverbs, composed and reduplicated adverbs are attested (e.g. bóm gbúù ‘once more’
and dáhbì dáhbì ‘repeatedly’).
The syntactic distribution of TAM adverbs is heterogeneous: they are found before
subject pronouns, after verb words, in both of these positions and, in one case (%âh ‘go
ahead…’), between the subject pronoun and verb word. However, consistent TAM
functions are associated with each position.

with which they may be used are limited. Stems with which this type of semantic shift

"6.1 Personal pronouns

related values (6.1.1). Pronouns are used to mark subjects (6.1.2), objects (6.1.3) and
possessors (6.1.4). Each category of personal pronoun is found with a corresponding set
of emphatic pronouns (6.1.5).

Instances of formal redundancy between some of the slots are summarized in 6.1.1.5. In
particular, the third person generic (omitted in the main chart on the previous page; see
6.1.1.3) and third person impersonal slots are marginal, since in most cases they share the
form of other third person pronouns. Taking this into account, the basic pronoun system
of Mambay may be schematized as follows:

First-and-second (1&2) person pronouns are “inclusive,” that is, they involve (at least) a
speaker and an addressee. Mambay stands apart from most closely related languages and
other languages in the region not in that it has inclusive pronouns, but in that this slot is
distinguished for “singular” and plural (Duru / Yag Dii in north-central Cameroon also
exhibits this system; see Bohnhoff 1986:104). 1&2 singular pronouns refer to the
minimal communication dyad, namely, a speaker and an addressee.

1&2SG.POSSour (your (sg.) and my) stoolFrom a numeric point of view, these pronouns are dual rather than singular. However, in
the pronominal system, they pattern as singular by virtue of a grammaticalized opposition
to the 1&2 plural pronouns (cf. Thomas 1955:207–8, Corbett 2000:166–9, Cysouw
2003:85–90, 260–4 and 2005:5). 1&2 plural pronouns refer to a communication dyad
with a speaker, an addressee, and at least one other participant. The “other(s)” may be
aligned with either the speaker or the addressee.

the plural (this is also the case in Duru; see Bohnhoff 1986:104, 129 footnote 3). In fact,
for verbal subject pronouns, 1&2 singular and plural forms are identical; the singular vs.
plural distinction is instead formalized on verbs through the use of the verbal plurality
affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) and singular vs. plural reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) on verb stems.

contains a morpheme with the consonant z. This underlines the 1&2 plural’s formal
alignment with other explicit plural marking in the language, which is also typically
found with z (5.5, 5.9.2.1, 7.3.1.1).
An alternative presentation of the same system using the more familiar distinctions of
inclusive vs. exclusive and singular vs. dual vs. plural has also been considered. In such
a presentation, the 1&2 singular slot shown above would be labelled “first person
inclusive dual” and the 1&2 plural slot would be labelled “first person inclusive plural”;
also—and importantly—the first person plural slot described in this study would be recast
as “first person exclusive plural.” Such a description is provided for a parallel system in
Margi (a Chadic language of Nigeria) by Hoffman (1963:72ff.). The two presentations
may be compared as follows:

up a dual vs. plural opposition, even though a “dual” category is not grammaticalized
elsewhere in the Mambay pronoun system (or anywhere in the language, for that matter;
see Thomas 1955:205, Plank 1996 and Cysouw 2003:87–8). In contrast, the presentation
with 1&2SG/PL slots recognizes a communication dyad as a basic person category; as
such, it brings out symmetry in the applicability of plurality to 1&2 person pronouns and
inherently singular pronouns (Greenberg 1988:3–4). The semantic confusion that arises
from the labelling of a “you-and-I” (i.e., 1&2SG) pronoun as singular can be addressed by
considering this pronoun, along with the inherently singular pronouns, as “minimal”;
remaining pronouns could be considered “augmented,” since they all involve the addition
of “other” persons to “minimal” slots (Bohnhoff 1986:104, Beavon 1986:175, Corbett
2000:199–9, Cysouw 2003:85–90, 2005:5).","[272, 273, 274, 275, 276]"
"4.1.2.4 Tone melodies and word classes
Possibilities for tone melodies associated with words are limited not only by the quantity
of available TBUs (4.1.2.1), but are also restricted by the word class to which a word
belongs. For example, although most verb roots are comprised of a single heavy syllable
(2.4.3), in their basic (Perfective) form they make use of only two of four possible
melodies (H and L but not HL and LH) (7.3.2.2.1). The vast majority of nouns, in
contrast, are associated with complex tone melodies (especially HL, LH and HLH), and
the simple melodies H and L are associated with non-canonical nouns (5.1.1.2).
An inventory of tone melodies associated with attested CV shapes of members of each
word class is found at the beginning of the relevant sections in the following chapters.

plural subject is invoked in the Imperfective, the verbal plural affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) is
attached following the first syllable of the verbal noun (7.4.1.1.2).

and the structurally irregular intransitive verbal nouns (5.9.1.2).
5.9.1.1 Regular verbal nouns
Regular verbal nouns are productively derived from transitive verbs stems; this is an
instance of what Payne (1997:224–5) calls action nominalization. Regular verbal nouns
are typically comprised of the same segmental content as corresponding stems (given
here as basic Perfective verb forms; see 7.4.1.1.1.1).

differ from the segmental content of the corresponding verb stems. Seven of the eight
exceptions are derived from verbs comprised of a C(C)V syllable, which does not meet
the minimal two-mora weight requirement for nouns (5.1.1.1). It appears, therefore, that
g has for the most part been inserted as a compensatory measure. These verbal nouns are
as follows:

stems. Regular verbal nouns exhibit two possible melodies: L and HL. Regular verbal
nouns with L tone may be derived from verbs with either H-toned (Class 1) or L-toned
(Class 4; see 7.3.2.2.1) stems.

The apparently polar tonal behaviour of 4na is addressed in the following subsection
(5.9.1.1.1). This is followed by a discussion of the function of regular verbal nouns as
Imperfective verb forms (5.9.1.1.2).
5.9.1.1.1 Tonal behaviour of 4na
A simple explanation for the polar tonal behaviour of 4na has not been reached.
However, it is probable that it underlyingly bears a contour (HL or LH) melody.
It is possible that 4na is underlying HL. If this is the case, its melody is fused with that
of L-toned verbal nouns as follows:

ûl
%â%+
+4nâ
4nâûl4ná
%â%4nádividing (something)
sowing (something)This implies the deletion of the final L tone of 4nâ, which never surfaces with a HL
verbal noun. Since, in these examples, there are only three tone-bearing units on the
resulting verbal noun word, it is not unreasonable to posit the lexical deletion of an
excess fourth tone (cf. 4.3.1.4). Comparable situations are attested elsewhere in the
language (e.g., a HLH melody on two-mora nouns; see 4.1.2.2). However, in stems with
sufficient tone-bearing units, there is no evidence that this hypothetical final L tone is
ever associated.

accepted. First of all (similar to what is described in the HL explanation above), the
melody of HL verbal nouns would have to have fused with that of the LH suffix 4naF,
resulting in a single HLH word.
ûl
%â%+
+4naF
4naFûl4ná
%â%4nádividing (something)
sowing (something)The LH identity of 4na would be more difficult to account for with the other (“L-toned”)
verbal nouns. It is possible that the underlying tone of what are described above as Ltoned verbal nouns is actually LH, even though the H portion of the melody only surfaces
when
4na replaces the explicit object. The loss of the LH verb’s H tone when
accompanied by an explicit object would be seen as parallel to the attested loss of any LH
possessed noun’s H tone in the context of the possessive construction (see 5.2.2.1). If
this were the case, the verbal noun data throughout would be re-presented as follows:
verbal nounverbal noun w/ explicit objectfòó
gbuFgfòò …
gbùg …spying (something)
throwing (something)The result of affixation with 4naF would be as follows:
fòó
gbuFg+
+4naF
4naFfòó4nà
gbuFg4nà230spying (something)
throwing (something)Still, the final H of 4naF never surfaces. But since there are only three morae on the
resulting verbal noun word, and since (in contrast to HLH verbal noun words; see above)
there are no examples in the data of LHL verbal noun words with more tone-bearing units
than this, it is not unreasonable to posit the lexical deletion of an excess fourth tone
(4.3.1.1). Comparable situations are attested elsewhere in the language (e.g., a three-tone
melody on two-mora nouns; see 4.1.2.2).
An underlying H melody for 4na is harder to defend, but should also be considered. As
in the previous hypothesis, affixation with HL nouns would be straightforward.

H-toned:

gbuFgfòò …
gbùg …spying (something)
throwing (something)With LH verbal nouns, it is possible that Meeussen’s rule (see Meeussen 1965:110 and
Goldsmith 1984) causes a H-toned 4ná suffix to be realized as L after H:
fòó
gbuFg+
+4ná
4náfòó4nà
gbuFg4nàspying (something)
throwing (something)The major weakness of this explanation is that such a process has not been observed
elsewhere in the language (merging of H tones is the norm in other phonological words;
for an example, look at inalienable noun-pronoun constructions in 5.3.4.2.4.1).
Because of the complexity of these arguments, the tonal identity of 4na is accounted for
throughout as part of lexical HLH and LHL melodies on words composed of a verbal
noun + 4na.
5.9.1.1.2 Imperfective function of regular verbal nouns
Apart from their basic nominal status, regular verbal nouns function as Imperfective verb
forms (7.4.1.1.2).","[243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248]"

thingThe verbal plural affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) is used with verbal nouns in Imperfective
conjugations. With intransitive verbs, it attaches following the first syllable of the verbal
noun. For monosyllabic verbal nouns, this is straightforward.
mì Qáà
1SG move.away:VNI move away / I am moving awaynà Qáà4zí
we (incl.) move away / we (incl.) are moving away
1&2 move.away:VN-PL
With disyllabic verbal nouns, morphophonological alternations are complex. If the
verbal noun has two light syllables and the vowel of the first syllable is an exact echo of
the second syllable’s vowel (i.e., V1=V2), the second vowel is deleted when 4zí is added.
mì vágà
1SG go:VNI go / I am goingnà vâg4zí
1&2 go:VN-PLwe (incl.) go / we (incl.) are goingOtherwise, the second syllable is maintained, and 4zí precedes it.
mì héérà
1SG climb:VNI climb / I am climbingnà héé4zí4rà
1&2 climb:VN-PL-VNwe (incl.) climb / we (incl.) are climbing (cf. héérà ‘climbing’)347The affixation of 4zí to some disyllabic nouns is accompanied by irregular morphological
alternations—even suppletion. For example, the final syllable of a two-syllable irregular
verbal noun changes to 4rV if the original suffix is 4gV. (This alternation corresponds
the domain of vestigial noun suffixes, which are otherwise opaque. Note also that
historically, the value of the final vowel has often assimilated partially to the stem; see
5.1.3.2 and Anonby 2007b:REF).

1&2 walk:VN-PL-VNwe (incl.) walk / we (incl.) are walkingIn the case of a verbal noun ending in 4%V, a similar process happens, but the % of the

The tone of Imperfective forms of intransitive verbs is lexically determined and
unpredictable, because it is the same as that of the irregular verbal noun used in an
Imperfective function (5.9.1.2). Most commonly, it is HL (for Imperfective forms
corresponding to intransitive stems in any tone class; see 5.9.1.2). For transitive verbs,
the tone melody of the verbal noun is uniform within a given tonal class (5.9.1.1).
Examples of Imperfective forms from each of the six tonal classes (separated here for
transitivity) are as follows:349tonal class, v. word tone

Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. Negative forms of the
Imperfective, which are marked with a HL pronoun, are discussed in 7.5.
An example from the data which shows that an Imperfective may be anchored to past
events in a story line is as follows:

7.4.1.2 Irrealis
Irrealis forms signal events that have not already happened and which are not happening.
They have in common a CVV subject pronoun shape. Irrealis verb forms are represented
by the Future tense and negated Indicative verb forms. Although this higher-level
grouping could seem like an ad hoc device to account for a coincidental formal match,
Payne (1997:244–5) and Palmer (2001:168–75) state that both future and negative forms
frequently pattern as irrealis in languages that mark this distinction; Roberts (1990) gives
examples of this (see especially p. 378).
While the Future tense is presented in this section, negated Indicative verb forms are
addressed in 7.5.","[363, 364, 365, 366, 367]"

in noun phrases is found in 4.3.1.
5.2.2.2 Canonical nouns
Linked forms of nouns with some of the canonical noun shapes (5.1.1.1) undergo
segmental alternations as a result of morphological templates applied to their
corresponding free forms. While CVV and C(C)VC nouns are exempt from segmental
alternation, other canonical nouns are usually modified as follows:173free form of

The presence of prefixes (5.1.2) on otherwise canonical nouns does not affect their
eligibility for morphophonological alternation.

nouns with an equivalent preglottalized semivowel–nasalized vowel CVV structure).
QâhQîh )ííname/weaver (bird sp.) / my name/weaver5.2.2.2.2 CCVV
The linked form of some CCVV nouns is signalled by the application of a CVV template.
When the template applies to noun roots comprised of CyVV or CwVV syllables
containing low vowels, the onset’s semivowel coalesces with its vowel. This results—
similarly to what happens to yVV or wVV nouns (5.2.2.2.1)—in linked forms with front
and back mid vowels respectively:

grass / my grass
peanut / my peanut
tree sp. / my tree sp.
hand / my hand (alienable)(Exceptionally, the linked form of kwàá ‘neck, voice’ is kùù.)
When the low vowel is nasalized, its realization in the linked form is high rather than
mid. These forms reflect the language-wide restriction on nasalized mid vowels (3.1.1).

Some canonical nouns exhibit irregular linked forms. A small number, including body
parts as well as a few other common nouns, have more than one form (5.2.2.2.6.1).
Linked forms with other irregularities are given in 5.2.2.2.6.2.
5.2.2.2.6.1 Nouns with more than one linked form
There are a number of body parts and other commonly used nouns with optional
monosyllabic linked forms. There is significant but incomplete overlap between words
with these short linked forms and words which may be used in inalienable possessive
constructions (compare the list in 5.3.4.1).
Invariably, monosyllabic linked forms are more commonly used than the
morphologically regular longer forms (i.e., those which are subject to the morphological
template given in 5.2.2.2). When questioned concerning differences in the usage of
respective long and short forms, Mambay speakers cite factors such as formal vs.
informal register, whole vs. part designation, neutral vs. emphatic linking, and
distant/intangible vs. proximal/tangible presence. However, none of these variables have
been consistently borne out by elicited examples, and instances of the longer forms are
altogether absent in the spontaneous text that has been gathered. It is possible that the
longer forms are archaic but legal alternatives for the short forms. An exhaustive list of
nouns with optional monosyllabic linked forms is given here, and has been broken down
based on morphological patterns.
First, there are a number of CVV.CV words with a regular (long) CVV.Ci linked form
and a short CVV form.

nape (of neck) / my nape (al.)
dance / my danceIt is interesting to note that the consonant in the last syllable of each of these nouns
(which is deleted in the short linked form) is one of the common alveolar segments r l or
n. There is no consistent phonological distinction that sets these nouns apart from most
other nouns (without a short linked form) that have r l or n in the last syllable (e.g.,
5.2.2.2.4, 5.2.2.2.5). However, the lack of short linked forms which correspond to free
forms with g in the last syllable is conspicuous, since in the lexicon as a whole g is also
very common in this position (5.1.3.2).
There is a single CVV.CV word with a regular (long) CVV.Ci linked form and a short
CV prefix form which is tonally simplified (see 5.1.2.4.3).

“intermediate” form of síínà ‘play’ in the

(these two nouns have irregular plurals which are formed in a similar way; see 5.5.2.1.5):

CV.CV noun roots (cf. 5.2.2.2.3) exhibit an irregular tonal alternation. Rather than
retaining the complexity of their basic tone melody in their linked form, as is the case for
other HL nouns (5.2.2.1), their HL tone melody is simplified to H.

"7.4.2.2 Subjunctive constructions with kà
Optative verb forms are also found in subjunctive constructions with the adverbializer kà
‘when, and then’ (10.2.2.2). Semantically, a purpose clause (‘so that, in order to’) results
from the combination of kà and the Optative verb form. The structure of the Optative in
this context is the same as that found in main clauses (7.4.2.1).
Examples of Optative verb forms used with kà are as follows:

7.4.2.3 Subjunctive constructions with pá ‘make, do’
Finally, Optative verb forms are found in subjunctive constructions which pattern as the
object of pá ‘make, do’ (7.6.3). In this case, a periphrastic causitive construction results:356mì pàg4rú

Five of the six basic inflectional categories (7.4) have corresponding negative forms
(7.5.1). The segmental and tonal form of a verb word remains constant when it is
negated. Verbal negation is instead marked by negative particles (7.5.2), and with
Indicative verb forms, by negative subject pronouns (7.5.3). A summary of negative
verbal forms is provided in 7.5.4.","[373, 374]"

From a semantic as well as phonological point of view, the four verbal extensions 4ri, 4gi,
4r, and 4g (7.2.1) appear to be intimately connected. Consequently, any decision to
distinguish or conflate these extensions needs to be defended.
An initial comparison of verbs with 4ri, 4gi, 4r and 4g reveals an apparent contrast among
the four extensions. In the following set of words, the four verbal extensions are attached
to roots which appear to be phonologically equivalent. While 4ri and 4gi constitute a new
syllable in an extended verb stem (7.2.1), 4r and 4g replace the second timing unit of a
long vowel in the verb root to which they are attached (7.2.1) as follows:
hààrí coil
sààgí deceive, flatter
hàr hurry
tàg
sweep, clean, plundercf. háá come back, go back
cf. sáá tell, trick, finish
cf. háá come back, go back
cf. táá stirHowever, the relationships among the four extensions are more complex than this
apparent contrast suggests. In the following sections, the semantic and distributional
relationships between pairs of similar forms are discussed. There, it is suggested that 4ri
and 4gi are partially complementary, and that while 4ri and 4r are also partially
complementary, 4gi and 4g should be regarded as contrastive. Finally, 4r and 4g
demonstrate clear evidence of contrast.
Partial complementarity of
and
Although contrast is presented immediately above for the verbal extensions 4ri and 4gi,
an examination of their lexical distribution, semantic value and phonological distribution
reveals a surprising degree of complementarity.
Unlike the corresponding extensions 4r and 4g (cf. below), 4ri and 4gi are virtually
lexically complementary in the data; a given verb root may be associated either with -ri
313or with 4gi, but usually not with both. The only exceptions are the following pairs of
stems:
dèNmgí
dèNmrí
cf. dèNmharmonize
comment repeatedly
commentnàNwgí
nàNwrí
cf. nàNwspank repeatedly =
spank repeatedly
spankWhile one substitution makes a difference in meaning, the other does not.
The comparable semantic value of the extensions 4ri and 4gi supports a similar pattern of
complementarity. Both forms signal actions which are repeated or intensified (7.2.3).
Since the two extensions are typically found with complementary sets of verb roots (see
previous paragraph), a direct and representative comparison of their meaning is not
possible. These extensions are variously found on verbs with iterative or intensive
values: on the one hand, verbs with 4ri are about evenly divided between those which
contain iterative and intensive meanings; on the other hand, verbs in which 4gi carries an
iterative meaning are arguably more common than those which are intensive, but not
significantly so.
Finally, there is partial complementarity in the phonological distribution of the two
extensions (7.2.3). It is true that either may be associated with a verb stem ending in a
vowel or a labial consonant. However, in other environments, complementarity is clear:
while on the one hand only 4ri is found with verb roots ending in g, on the other hand
only 4gi is found with roots ending in an alveolar consonant or 7.
Relationships within the extension pairs
/ and
/
Although apparent contrast between 4ri and 4r and between 4gi and 4g is shown above
(7.2.6), the relationship between members of these extension pairs is more complex than
this.
There is an obvious structural similarity between 4ri and 4r and between 4gi and 4g. The
possibility of complementarity is especially plausible in light of i-insertion phenomena
found at morpheme boundaries elsewhere in the language: for example, the causative
extension 4n is realized as 4ni in certain morphological contexts (7.2.3.1; for other similar
examples, see 5.2.2, 7.1.2.1, 7.1.2.2 and 7.4.2.1). A further indicator of complementarity
is that whenever these extensions are one of two associated with the same root, 4r or 4g is
always placed first, while 4ri or 4gi is invariably placed second (7.2.5).
This evident complementarity is disrupted by the semantic values associated with each
form (7.2.3–7.2.4). On the one hand, 4gi and 4g are semantically distinct: whereas 4gi
bears an iterative or intensive value, 4g is bears an extensive value and is clearly neither
314iterative nor intensive. On the other hand, a semantic distinction is more difficult to draw
between 4ri and 4r. Like 4gi, 4ri carries an iterative or intensive value. However, 4r
shares only the intensive value of 4ri and is never iterative.
Based on these semantic considerations, and despite the partial phonological and
morphological complementarity that is evident, it is necessary to posit contrast between 4
ri and 4r and between 4gi and 4g.
Contrast between r and g
The preceding discussion shows that a partial complementarity exists between the
extensions 4ri and 4gi as well as between members of the extension pairs 4ri / 4r and 4gi /
4g. It is therefore reasonable to consider whether the extensions 4r and 4g may also be
partially complementary. However, this is not the case; the distribution of 4r and 4g is
contrastive in some word pairs. Examples which show this are as follows:

sùr

cross7.3 Verb word morphology
Verb words, along with subject pronouns (6.1.2, 7.4) and expansions of verb forms (7.6),
are fundamental in furnishing morphological structures which communicate the functions
of verbal inflection in Mambay (7.4). In the present section, affixational possibilities are
catalogued (7.3.1) and the tonal behaviour of the verb word is discussed (7.3.2.2.3).
Elements of verb classification (7.3.2) and are then followed by a description of the
morphology of irregular verbs (7.3.3).","[328, 329, 330, 331, 332]"
"339happening. The Future tense (typically; see 7.4.1.2.1) as well as negated forms of
Indicative verbs (7.5) are expressed using Irrealis pronouns (this grouping is defended in
7.4.1.2). All other Indicative verb forms fall under the domain of Realis.
Among Realis verb forms, a distinction is made between Perfective (7.4.1.1.1) and
Imperfective (7.4.1.1.2) aspects. Perfective forms communicate events which have been
completed in reference to a given point in time, and Imperfective forms refer to events
which happen but which have not been completed in reference to a given point in time.
Perfective forms are represented by three distinct tenses (basic Perfective, Perfect and
Pluperfect), but there is only one basic Imperfective tense. The two aspects differ
formally in several respects. First of all, the segmental shape of the Perfective is the verb
stem, but that of the Imperfective is the verbal noun (5.9). Secondly, while the third
person is invariably marked in the Perfective with a zero pronoun, it is marked in the
Imperfective with a segmental pronoun )à whenever there is no nominal subject
(7.4.1.1.2). Thirdly, the negated form of the Perfective is found with a LH pronoun, but
negated Imperfective forms are found with a HL pronoun (7.5.3).
The Optative and the five Indicative tenses (basic Perfective, Perfect, Pluperfect,
Imperfective and Future) are distinguished from one another by contrastive tone melodies
and by the inventory of verbal suffixes which may found with each (7.3.1). The tone
melodies associated with the possible forms of a given verb fall into six tonal sets or
classes (7.3.2.2). If the tone melody is known for the basic Perfective, Perfect and
Future, melodies for the remaining forms can be predicted. Concerning the inventory of
verbal suffixes, reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) are obligatorily found with Perfect and
Pluperfect forms of intransitive verbs, and optionally found with Future and Optative
forms of intransitive verbs. Further, the Perfect forms of transitive verbs always take the
suffix 4rì, and Imperfective forms of transitive verbs must take the dummy object suffix 4
na if there is no explicit object.
An additional minor verb form, a Realis Future, is found uniquely with the verb vè ‘go’
(7.3.3.1.2). It is composed of an Imperfective pronoun and a Future verb stem.
Each of the basic infectional categories is presented in the sections below (7.4.1–7.4.2).
Negative verb forms are considered separately (7.5). Criteria used for distinguishing verb
forms, all of which have been presented in this section, are summarized in the following

inalienable pronouns and nouns, is described in 5.3.4.2.5.
In most cases, the segmental structure of an inalienable noun-pronoun possessive
construction is a simple amalgamation of the linked form (5.2.2) of the head noun and the
inalienable possessive pronoun.

possessive pronouns and the head nouns to which they are attached. These alternations
are summarized in the following subsections according to the segmental context offered
by the linked forms of head nouns they accompany.
Complete paradigms of regular inalienable possession are provided for all shapes in
Appendix 1, and all of the numerous idiosyncratic paradigms are also given.
6.1.4.2.1 With linked forms ending in a long vowel
Inalienable possessive constructions involving nouns with linked forms ending in a long
vowel insert n before the first person singular suffix 4í as a means of avoiding illegal
VVV structures, which are not found elsewhere in the language.

In constructions involving nouns with linked forms ending in a consonant, the second
person singular suffix 4mi is realized as 4Vgm (where V is an echo of the vowel in the
previous syllables, but which carries the High tone of the underlying suffix 4mi). This is a
means of avoiding an illegal CC coda, since no other such structures are found in the
language (2.4.1).

Constructions involving nouns with linked forms ending in an obstruent differ from other
constructions in that the third person singular co-reference/impersonal suffix 4lé is
realized as 4é:

Constructions involving nouns with linked forms ending in a sonorant differ from other
constructions in several ways. First, most CV suffixes that begin with a sonorant displace
the final sonorant of the linked form of the head noun:

forehead:LF4ná

3PL.C/I.POSS.INALtìré
their (coref./impers.)
front:3PL.C/I.POSS.INAL front, genitals (inal.)However, for the third person suffix 4 `rú, the suffix-initial r constricts to d when it
follows a sonorant, and does not replace the sonorant:

3PL.C/I.POSS.INALtìndú
his/her/its front (inal.)
front:3SG.POSS.INAL(Considering that dú is the independent form of the third person pronoun (6.1.2.1), this
d/r alternation more likely reflects a historical d r softening in word-internal positions
other than after r (see 2.1.2.2). However, since 4 `rú is synchronically represented in a
wider range of environments, it has been selected as the underlying form of the third
person singular pronoun.)284Additionally, the 4zíná variant of the first-and-second person plural suffix is optionally
reduced to 4zá when it attaches to n-final linked forms:

the suffix 4mi.

Three nouns, all of which express social relations, and all of which could be historically
composed, form inalienable possessive constructions differently than other nouns. These
nouns are as follows:
)ázì T
fààzí
fâhzímember of )àzgárà (see Glossary)
member of fààzárà ( ” )
member of fàhzárà ( ” )They pattern differently than other nouns in three ways. First, the nasality on the first
person form (usually marked by the suffixation of the nasalized pronoun 4í) does not
appear in the resulting possessive construction.

Although there was significant interaction between the Mambay and the Mundang at a
later time (1.1.3.2), and some present-day Mundang clans are reputed to originate from
among the Mambay (Adler 1982:122–6), the Mambay do not view the Mundang as one
of the peoples from whom they originate (Kam Kaagbungni 2000, Kada 2003,
Oussoumanou 2004, Kami Taw 2005; cf. 1964:292, contra Lestringant 1964:104).
1.1.3.2 Establishment of Fulbe hegemony
For several decades, the Fulbe were unable to gain dominance over the Mambay living
on the mountain, or over the separating floodplain of the Mayo Kebbi, since their cavalry
could not control the area for much of the year. During this time, the Mambay spread out
around the mountain. Their settlements extended from Kaakyo’w and Tara on the west
and south-west to Gehgu (Guégou) to the east and Beepahna (Biparé) to the north
(Lestringant 1964:291, Oussoumanou 2004). Lestringant states that the Mambay adopted
Mundang as a common language at this time, due to close relations with the Mundang of
Léré (1964:292, 296); however, Mambay historians maintain that the Mambay continued
to use their own language among themselves as a bò%gì ‘secret code, in-group language’
(Oussoumanou 2004, Kami Tao 2005; see also 1.1).
In the years leading up to 1850 and in much of the latter half of the 19th century, the
Fulbe principality of Bibémi, centred thirty kilometres south of the mountain, attacked
and progressively conquered the Mambay villages around the mountain (Lembezat
1964:292, Nassourou n.d.). Of all the villages, only Beepahna successfully resisted the
Fulbe forces thanks to its situation by the floodplain to the west and south, and an
independent Mundang principality to the north and east (Lembezat 1964:292, contra
Nassourou n.d.).
While some of the Mambay from villages conquered by the Fulbe took refuge and, in
time, settled on top of the mountain for over a decade, others became subjects of the
Fulbe. After this period, the mountain community began to come down and settle in the
now-desolate village of bò%gì (Balgi or Boulgui) on the north side of the mountain near
Kaaku’ (Kakou). With Kaakyo’w under Fulbe dominion, the Mambay were too weak to
resist the Fulbe from the north, who took over the floodplain and set up a government at
Golombé. Eventually, the Mambay of bò%gì consented to the Fulbe hegemony and were
permitted to inhabit the north side of the floodplain, which was better suited to
agriculture (Lestringant 1964:291, 312).
1.1.3.3 European colonial administration
The first written record of the Mambay people group was made in 1851 by Barth, who
did not visit the Mambay area but distinguished them as one of many people groups in
what would later become northern Cameroon (Barth 1857 in Lembezat 1964:75). In
1889, an English expedition travelled up the Mayo Kebbi and reached the Mambay
village of Beepahna (Biparé), passing several Mambay hamlets along the way. However,
their record of the voyage gives no further details (Meckler-Ferryman 1892 in Lembezat
1964:75).","[24, 25]"
