i-cuukIt is also found that the certainty form in Tima can be formed by the
certainty marker 'kV-' only without any use of the future marker 'dV-'.
This usually occurs as an answer to a question (see the question in (122a)
and its answer in (122b). The reply takes the certainty marker 'kV-' in
order to assert the occurrence of an action plus the subject pronominal
markers which follow it.

proclitic 'kV-' and uncertainty form with the proclitic aspect marker 'cʌ-'
plus the future tense maker 'dV-' (for examples see 4.4.1.1). The former is
considered as progressive future. Therefore, there is a complementary
distribution between the certainty as a mood marker and the aspect
marker 'cʌ-' (progressive and habitual markers). That is, they never occur
together in one sentence. This justifies their occurrence in one slot in
Table 4.1 which are represented by ASP and M (see 4.2).
The following section will be on the derivational processes on Tima
verbs. The section consists of several parts concerning the operation of
decreasing and increasing valency.","[230, 231, 232]"
"Dimmendaal and Gilley prepared, but have not yet published, some
phonological notes on Tima such as the distribution of consonants and
vowels with some minimal pair examples, the syllable structure of Tima
words with many questions on tones and the ATR system remaining
unclarified. The main purpose behind this phonology write-up was the
development of an orthographic system for the Tima language 2 . The most
recent source for the Tima language is found in unpublished field notes
collected by Dimmendaal in 2004 which is now considered as a basic
source for the current researches on Tima (see Dimmendaal, 2009).",[30]
"Tima has the suffix '-i' which is considered as a high transitive marker.
The majority of Tima verbs take this suffix. The appearance of this suffix
increases the valency of the verb in question. The '-i' suffix is considered212as a derivational marker that adds meaning to a verb root. But it can not
be separated from the root. In other words, the occurrence of this suffix 'i' is obligatory. Therefore, the whole verb form in this case is considered
as a stem which constitutes a root plus derivational suffix '-i'. The suffix
vowel is harmonized with the root vowel, either ± ATR. The examples of
transitive verbs are in (124):
(124)
a) mur-i'pick (it) off'b) kɪlɪŋ-ɪ'take over (somebody)' (the story of Horse quarrel)c) kuruh-i'push (it)'d) dah-ɪ'say (it)'e) hada-y-ɪ'jump over (it)'f) pu-y-i'shoot (it)'There is an epenthetic glide '-y-' in example (124e and f). This is due to
the fact that these verbs end with a vowel, consequently the glide occurs
in order to separate the final-root vowel and the transitive suffix 'ɪ-/i-'.","[233, 234]"
"The examples in (91) show that the numerals follow the nouns they
modify. Thus, the rule is:
NP → N + NumRegarding the ordinal numbers, they also follow the head noun which
they modify. For example:(92) Ø-wartamadɘhkɪ-ɲɛrNc.sg-manREL-first'(the) first man'117The ordinal number 'kɪɲɛr', 'first' also has the same form when it modifies
plural nouns in an NP. But there is an additional marker 'Vŋ' (literally
meaning ‘by’; i.e. it is actually an instrumental marker in Tima)
appearing before the number. In such cases, the plural referents are
treated as one unit as in (93).
(93) ɪ-wɘrtmadɘh-naɪŋ-kɪɲɛr-ɪNC.Pl-man-DemINST-first-FOCan-cu-uŋ
ASP.3sg-arrive-Ven'the first men arrived'The ordinal number 'kɪ-ɲɛr' has another plural form 'ɲ-iɲɛr' when the
head noun (referents) is treated as separate units as in (94).

'the first men arrived'Numerals can be used elliptically without a head noun, (especially in a
response to a question) for example:

a) a-tɪɪn
STAT.sg-onediy-ʌŋ
came-Ven'one came'118b) ɪ-hɪɪkdiy-ʌŋNC.Pl-twocame-Ven'two came'The Tima numerals are similar to nouns in that they can be inflected for
case markers. There are two possibilities for analyzing the form of the
number with the nasal element below. The examples in (96) show that the
number is inflected either for the instrumental marker '(V)ŋ-', 'by/with'
and at the same time it follows the noun which it modifies or by the
ergative marker in Tima N. Such a case usually occurs when the focus of
attention is on the number (this is the same nasal sound N which appears
in ergative case with pronouns and other elements in a sentence, see
4.3.2).
(96)
a) kwanaŋ-kɪtɪɪn'with/by one cow'b) yanaɲ-ɪhɪɪk'with/by two cows'The form of the inflected number for the instrumental marker usually
appears in the case of focusing on number and not on the action as in (97
a). But if the focus is on the action the instrumental marker disappears
from the number and instead the verb which described the action takes an
ergative case marker (an enclitic ergative pronoun). Compare the
examples in (97b) below.","[138, 139, 140]"
"4.6.1 Negative declarativeThe negation of declarative clauses involves a denial of intransitive,
transitive and ditransitive clauses or predications. All of these declarative
types are negated by two negative particles in the clause: the negative
particle 'kV-', which is procliticised to a verb; it occurs in slot 1 in Table
4.1, and the negative particle '-Vŋ' which is encliticised to a verb or verb
phrase; it occurs in slot 12 in Table 4.1 in case of intransitive verbs, and
the final position of a clause in case of transitive clauses. Therefore, the
former is considered as a particle which negates the whole clause. The
proclitic negative marker 'kV-' always fuses with the pronominal markers
in slot 3 in Table 4.1. The following examples illustrate negation with a
negative verb contrasting positive verb forms with negative ones.

particles in a clause, otherwise the resultant clause will be ungrammatical.
Compare example (177a and b) with the example in (176) above.","[276, 277]"
"4.4.3.1 The imperative mood
The imperative mood is used to give a direct command to addressee(s)
(Fromkin, 2005). In Tima, the positive imperative form of verbs is
205considered as a stem rather than a verb root. That is, the imperative often
takes different suffixes which provide an additional meaning to the root.
These suffixes are considered as derivational suffixes and the meaning of
verbs can not be completed without the appearance of those suffixes (see
section (4.5).
In Tima, the positive imperative mood is unmarked for person in the case
of 2nd person singular; i.e. it does not take any personal prefix as the
subjunctive mood type does. In the case of 2nd person plural it is marked
by the prefix 'na-' which is very productive in the language. It is found
that in the case of the negative imperative mood for the 2nd person
singular that the form is marked by the prefix 'a-' which occurs after the
negative proclitic 'kV-'. In this case the imperative form is classified as a
hortative form/mood (weak imperative/command, see 4.6 on verbal
negation).
The positive imperative form is considered as a simple form in Tima. It is
always used while discussing other word formation processes or in
explaining certain word-structure through out this study. The examples
are:
(115)
2nd sg
a) dɨŋʌʌŋ2nd Pl

'bring'b) daana-daa'run'c) hʊdɔnɔna-hadɔnɔ'sit down'd) hɘlakna-hɘlak'remain seated'e) paŋana-paŋa'open (mouth)'206With regard to the imperative formation of the 2nd person plural, it is
noticed that when the form starts with a consonant as in (115), the
personal prefix is just attached to the verb without any change in the
stem. On the other hand, when the imperative form starts with a vowel as
in (116), the glide '-y-' is inserted between the prefix and the stem (an
epenthetic glide). This occurs in order to avoid the combination of two
vowels.

'eat'b) ʌt̪inʌ-y-ʌt̪i'sleep'c) amaakna-y-amaak'wash yourself/yourselves'd) alɘmna-y-alɘm'bite'The structure of the positive imperative forms can be represented by the
following formula:
a) 2nd Sg: ø-stem
b) 2nd Pl:na-stemIn addition, there are a number of suppletive imperative forms in Tima.
The imperative form of the 2nd person plural is completely different from
the imperative form of the 1st person singular. Therefore, the 2nd plural
imperative forms are not predictable (see also 4.5.1.2). The examples are:207(117)

Subjunctive mood refers to verb forms or sentence type which indicate
the attitude of the speaker including tentativeness, vagueness, request or
uncertainty. It is considered as an indirect command. It always asks for
permission (Lyons, 1995).","[226, 227, 228, 229]"
"1.2 Language name and communityThe name Tima seems to be derived from one of the villages where this
language is spoken. The village name is 'tɨmmʌ', (Dimmendaal, 2009).
This name is used by other inhabitants of the Nuba Mountains including
Arabic communities without carrying any negative connotation to its
native speakers and it is widely used in the literature, i.e. this language
name is well known to the outsiders and linguists. Tima people refer to3their language as 'du-murik'. It also has several alternative names used by
others neighboring groups when referring to Tima speakers, such as:
Lomoriki, Tamanik, and Yibwa (Grimes, 1984).","[24, 25]"
"4.6.2 Negative imperative, subjunctive and veridical moodIn most cases, the imperative, subjunctive and veridical clauses in Tima
are negated in the same way as the negation of declarative clauses, i.e. by
the particle 'kV' and 'Vŋ'. The examples in 178 and 179 show how the257imperative negation is being applied to the 2sg, 2pl and the subjunctive
weak form in the case of 1pl inclusive. The negative particles are
underlined in the examples below. Concerning the negative particle 'kV',
here they are variable with regard to the person and number and they are
changed according to the vowel harmony of the verb root (Bashir
forthcoming).

The vowel of the negative proclitic 'kV(V)-' is lengthened. It is a result of
the combination of the proclitic vowel and the person marker in the case
of 2nd sg and 1pl incl, which is usually represented by the vowel 'a-' and
'i-', respectively (see 4.4.3.1).","[278, 279]"
"392.4.1.3 Negation
Sometimes, negation is considered as a mood type in contrast with
imperative and interrogative sentence type. But here the negation is taken
as a verbal inflection which modifies the verb and the verb phrase. This
leads us to distinguish between two types and strategies of sentence
negation as found in African languages. The first type is an internal
negation of the verb word which is common in African languages. This
usually involves affixes either before or after the verb word. An example
of this strategy is found in Aghem, a Benue-Congo (Niger-Congo)
language (Anderson, 1979), and in Labala, a Bantu (Niger-Congo)
language (David Morgan, p.c.). The second type is an external negation
of the verb word. That is, negative particles occur in clause-final position
and it negates the whole clause or sentence. In the case of transitive
verbs, the negative particle occurs after the object. This type is found in
Chadic languages in Nigeria and Cameroon (Creissels, 2008).
Tima has two obligatory negative particles that appear in a negative
sentence: The negative proclitic marker 'kV-' and the negative enclitic
marker '-Vŋ'. In this respect, Tima resembles Hausa, a Chadic language
(Kraft and Kraft, 1973) and Gur (Niger- Congo) languages (Watters,
2000) in using double negative particles which are external to the verb
word. Consequently, Tima in most cases displays the following negative
pattern: (S) NEG-SM-V root-(O)-NEG (see 4.6).","[60, 61]"

follows:
NEG + IMP/SUBJ (O) + NEG
With regard to the negation of veridical clauses, it has been mentioned in
Section (4.4.3.4) that the verdical marker in Tima is 'kV-', therefore
haplology (see section 2.2.1.3) as a phonological process takes place
when negating these clauses. That is, the proclitic negative marker 'kV-' is
dropped because of its similarity with the veridical marker 'kV-', while
the enclitic negative marker '-Vŋ' occurs. The examples are in (180)
below.

Tima uses the two negative strategies mentioned above. In the case of
perfective situation the common negative strategy ('kV-' and '-Vŋ'
particles) is used as in (180). Alternatively, in the case of imperfective
situations the quantifier 'amaŋ' is used as in (181). This form consists of
the stative marker 'a-' plus 'maŋ' which means 'it is nothing'. But actually
the form 'maŋ' has no meaning by itself; see the examples below.","[279, 280, 281]"
"2.4.1.2 Tense/Aspect/Mood
Tense, aspect and mood are the most important inherent categories of
verbs. They are inflected on verb by means of different grammatical
processes such as affixation, stem modification, reduplication or
suppletion. With regard to tense, languages usually make distinctions of
events according to the time of speech. Comrie (1985) mentions that
some languages make a three-way distinction for tense: past, present and
future; for example English and Swahili. Other languages make a twoway distinction: either between past vs non-past or future vs. non-future;
for example Dyirbal (Australian, northern Queensland) and Hua (a
language of New Guinea). Accordingly, Tima can be characterized as a
language that makes a two-way distinction between future and nonfuture. The future in Tima is morphologically marked by a prefix 'dV-'
whereas the non-future (which includes the past and present tense) is
morphologically unmarked, i.e. has a zero morpheme (see 4.4).
According to Comrie (1976), aspect (unlike tense) is concerned with the
internal structure of the situation. Therefore, verbs in a language can be
classified according to their aspectual categories. The distinction is
usually made between perfective vs. imperfective, dynamic vs. stative,
habitual, progressive, and inceptive aspect. These aspectual categories are
in most cases marked morphologically on verbs and in other cases they
are marked analytically or lexically (see Payne, 1997).
37Another prominent feature which is associated with aspectual
grammatical categories is 'aktionsart'; in other contexts this inflectional
category is referred to as lexical aspect (Comrie, 1981). Whaley (1997:
214) mentions that ""aktionsart plays an important role in determining
how time reference in a sentence is understood"". Thus, a verb conveys an
inherent aspectual meaning of being extended or not extended in time.
The English verb 'read' as an example is durative and this means that the
action described by the verb lasts for a certain period of time, whereas the
verb 'sneeze' is punctual, because the event happens instantaneously.
Accordingly, Bybee (1985) states that languages appear to have different
aktionsart classes, for example: punctual, iterative, durative, stative,
achievement and accomplishment.
Mood ('modality', or 'mode') is another important category of a verb. It is
defined by Crystal (1991: 223) as ""a grammatical category through which
the speakers of a language can indicate whether they believe that an event
or state actually occurs, does not occur, or has the potential to occur"".
Traditionally, grammarians and linguists categorize a sentence into major
types based on mood. These types are: indicative, imperative,
subjunctive, and interrogative mood. These categories may be signaled by
alternative inflectional forms of the verb. For example, in Alaaba (a
Cushitic language spoken in Ethiopia) mood is marked morphologically
on verbs especially in the case of directive and optative, while the
indicative mood is unmarked (Schneider-Blum, 2007).","[58, 59]"
"254In Section 4.6.1 the negative constructions of declarative sentence type
will be presented. The negative construction of the imperative,
subjunctive and veridical mood will be shown in 4.6.2. The negation of
perfective and imperfective verb forms will be described and discussed in
Section 4.6.3.","[275, 276]"
"2.4.1 Verb structure
Usually, the verb consists of a number of morphemes which express
different grammatical categories plus the verb root. The output verb form
is referred to as a verb stem. For instance, the English verb 'look' is
considered as a verb root where the verb 'look' plus the '-ed' past marker
form the verb stem 'looked'. The order of morphemes in the verb differs
from one language to another. Some of them appear either as prefixes/
suffixes or as infixes. If one looks at Swahili verb structure (an SVO
language), different slots are occupied by different morphological
categories,forexample,subjectagreement-Tense/Aspect-(objectagreement)-verb root-(derivational suffixes)-mood vowel. Tima verb
structure is much more complicated than the Swahili verb structure. The
Tima verb, in its most complex form, contains more than ten slots
expressing different grammatical categories, such as the following:
(negative marker) - aspect marker - proclitic subject marker – tense - verb
root - (derivational suffixes) - (object marker) - enclitic subject marker (negative marker) (see 4.2 on the verb as a word structure). These various
slots on the verb express different types of inherent grammatical
categories associated with the verb such as subject/object marker (i.e.
person markers), TAM, derivational affixes. These grammatical35categories of the verb will be discussed below with reference to their
occurrence mainly in African languages.","[56, 57]"
"188(76) ɛn-tiya-ataŋ-dʌkʊ-kwanASP.PAST.1sg-open-PRF-1sgNC.sg-door'I opened the door'The imperfective aspect of the above verbs is formed either by internal
change of the root in addition to the dropping of the suffix, as in the case
of example (75 and 77) with the verb 'tɔmɔ', 'kill', whereas in the case of
the verb 'tiyu', 'open' as in example (76) above, the imperfective aspect of
that verb is formed by using the imperfective/habitual aspect marker '-a/ʌ'. For the imperfective sentences, see the example in (77) and (78),
respectively.

Nc.sg-door'I will open the door'Class 2: Suppletive verbs
The second class involves a group of verbs where there is no relation
between the telic verb form and the atelic one. That is, the telic verb is
completely different from the atelic verb; i.e. it is a suppletive form. They
are lexically related from a semantic point of view. Thus, it is
189unproductive to derive the telic verb out of the atelic verb or vice versa.
This class of suppletive verbs, which are used in order to distinguish
between telic (perfective) and atelic verbs (imperfective), is common in
Nilo-Saharan languages. The verb forms in (79) are examples of this
class.
(79)
Telic
a) hɔɔAtelic
taanGloss
'hit'b) cʊʊhɪbɪ'thrust'c) kɔyɔŋaak'make'The verb 'hɔɔ' 12, 'hit' is described as a telic verb. It indicates that an
action has an end and it is directed towards a specific goal (punctual
verb). The verb 'hɔɔ' is associated only with perfective aspect. That is,
the verb 'hɔɔ' can not be used in the present or in the future (the telic
verb will be glossed as perfective (PRF) in the examples). If one needs to
use this verb in its imperfective form/aspect, the atelic verb 'taan' is used
in such a case 13. It is associated with the imperfective aspect; therefore,
the atelic verb will be glossed as imperfective (IMPF)).

"If the imperative verb stem takes a direct object (i.e. if it is a transitive
verb), the second enclitic negative marker is encliticized to the end of the
clause. That is, it negates the whole clause as in (179).",[279]
"197The last two iterative verbs 'tʊnaak', 'grinding the flour' and 'tapaak',
'move from one item into another' in example (99) have no telic forms, a
fact following from the nature of the verb itself, i.e. they are inherently
iterative.
Tima has other verbs that are often used iteratively without any
derivational marker as the case mentioned above. For example:
(100)
a) ŋuni'move repeatedly'<awun'move once'b) tɘɘn'run and run (repeatedly)'<daa'run'c) taan'knock/hit repeatedly'<hɔɔ'hit once'Class 6: Inceptive situations/aspect
Payne (1997: 240) mentions that ""inceptive aspect expresses the starting
point of an event"". It is often translated into English as 'to start doing
something'. Inceptive aspect in Tima is expressed morphologically by
means of a morpheme '-aa' as a suffix on verbs. In this case the inceptive
aspect indicates either a state or an entry to that state; i.e. the situation is
bounded into its beginning rather than its end (Lehmann, 1991). The
inceptive aspect is associated with perfective aspect but it does not
actually indicate a completion of a situation; in fact, they refer to its
inception. The examples from Tima are:198(101)

"244Another way of analyzing the structure of Tima verbal adjectives is by
comparing them with the Tima verbal nouns. Both end with the suffix 'Vl', but they differ in the shape of the marker which precedes the verbal
root. What happens is that the verbal noun prefix 'kV-' (nominalizer) is
replaced by the stative marker 'a-' in order to derive the verbal adjectives,
or the opposite is true, because the derivational direction is not clear. In
short, the verbal adjective is derived from the verbal noun by replacing
the nominalizer 'kV-' by the stative marker 'a-'. In this case the verbal
adjectives behave similar to Tima verbs by taking the stative marker 'a-'.

the relativizer 'kV-', which is also attested with adjectives when they
function as attributive modifiers in the NP. In this case the verbal
adjectives behave like pure/content adjectives (Sasse, 1993) 28.

"2.2.1.2 Stem modifications
A stem modification is another process which affects word structure; it
involves non-concatenation morphology 5 . Spencer (1991) stated that
stem modifications in many languages indicate grammatical categories by
a shift of vowel, consonant, stress and tone. English is an example where
the vowel alternation device marks tense in verbs such as 'drink/drank/
5The process of non-concatenative morphology indicates that the complex derived word form can not
be easily segmented into different morphemes; instead the morphological process can be described in
process terms (Haspelmath, 2002).",[41]
"313The Tima pronominal system played a great role in the formation of the
verbal word. That is, the pronominal person markers (subject and/or
object) were obligatory on the verb, and without them the meaning of the
verb is incomplete (i.e. according to the syntactic function of the
participants).
The pronominal person markers usually fuse with the markers that
distinguish tense, aspect and mood and they form together a
portemanteau morpheme. Therefore, a separate section has been added in
order to discuss this phenomenon in the language. Tima has a binary
tense system, i.e. it has a two-way distinction, between future and nonfuture. Tima relies heavily on the aspect distinction, i.e. on the
perfectivity and imperfectivity of an action or event. This aspect in Tima
is morphologically marked by different morphemes (e.g. progressive,
habitual, iterative, etc.). With regard to mood, Tima has a number of
different mood types such as imperative, hortative, subjunctive, indicative
and veridical mood. Most of them are marked morphologically.
The verb extensions, as one of the prominent features of Niger-Congo
languages, were discussed elaborately for Tima. The description focused
on the derivational processes that derive verbs out of other verbs. This is
done through a number of different affixes (suffixes) on the verb in
addition to pluractional marking which is marked by different strategies
in the language, including vertical (non-concatenative) morphology.
The chapter concluded by presenting the two different strategies of verbal
negation: (i) with the negative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic'Vŋ'
and (ii) with the negative expression 'amaŋ'. It is found that Tima has a314common strategy of negating declarative sentences, which is the first one
mentioned above. Moreover, the form of negated sentences depends on
the aspect distinction, e.g. whether it is perfective or imperfective. In the
latter, the negation-marking expression 'amaŋ' is used.
Chapter five covered all the different types of nominal derivation. It is
divided into two main parts. The first part showed how nouns are derived
mainly from verbs and adjectives, besides the diminutive, reduplicated
and ideophonic nouns which do not derive from verbs. It has covered,
first, the structure of verbal nouns and how they differ in their structure
from the common nouns found in Tima. They were classified into
different classes according to their endings. In addition, the different
functions of the verbal nouns were illustrated.
The agentive nouns were included, whereby different types have been
used in order to express the concept of someone who does an action. It
was found that they are formed in most cases by a combination of a
verbal noun and bound elements. In other cases, they are formed
independently from the bound elements.
Abstract nouns were also shown in this chapter. They divided into two
types. The first type included nouns which are derived from verb roots.
They are formed by the processes of prefixation and suffixation. The
second type was derived from adjectives by a process of prefixation. In
addition, other types of nominalized nouns were diminutive, reduplicated
and ideophonic nouns have been presented.
The second part of the chapter has covered the compounding of nouns as
another process of noun formation. Different types of compounds were315found in Tima, such as endocentric, exocentric and co-ordinate
compounds. Each one was dealt with in isolation in order to present its
common structure and the way it behaved in the language.
There are still several areas which have not been covered yet. Therefore,
the study demands further investigation, especially with regard to the
Tima verbal system.","[334, 335, 336, 337]"
"2.2.1.4 Compounding
Compounding is another morphological process shared in the formation
of word structure. Spencer (1991: 309) defined compounding as
""prototypically the concatenation of words to form other words"". A
compound form consists of two/more members of (potentially) open
lexical class. For instance, English allows several types of combinations
of different word-classes (N+N, A+N, V+N, N+V, N+A, A+A, etc.).
Usually, the two items that are brought together in a compound also24appear as independent words in a language on the one hand (e.g.
blackboard). On the other hand, one of the compound elements can
appear as an independent word (e.g. strawberry). Sometimes, both
members of compound are elements that only occur together (e.g.
mushroom) (Fabb, 1998).
According to the structure of compounding, there are various types of
compounding that are widespread across languages. The commonest
types of compounding are: endocentric, exocentric, and appositional/coordinate compounds (for definition see 5.2).
There is a difficulty encountered in various languages when trying to
distinguish between compounds and phrases (especially NP). Fabb (1998)
mentioned that compounds resemble phrasal combination in some ways 6 .
To avoid such resemblance between the two categories a number of
criteria are stated in order to distinguish between them. Firstly, the
phonological criteria sometimes help in that. The suprasegmental
processes, for instance the stress patterns, which are restricted to the
compounds, may differ from those restricted to the phrases (e.g. English,
'the white house').
Secondly, some languages may mark the compounds morphologically.
That is, a morpheme may be inserted between the two words, found only
in compounds, and it considered as a special empty suffix semantically
(e.g. the morpheme 's' in German, 'Volk-s-wagen', 'lit. people's car').","[45, 46]"

It is noticed that the negative particles usually harmonize with the verb

'kV-' harmonizes with the verb root with regard to the feature of ± ATR
and to the other qualities of the vowel (in terms of frontness, height, or
backness), (Bashir forthcoming).
All tenses (future vs. non-future) of verbs are negated simply by adding
the two negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ'. See the examples above.","[277, 278]"
"4.4.2.3 The perfective vs. imperfective aspect
Comrie (1976: 16) points out that ""perfectivity indicates the view of a
situation as a single whole, while imperfectivity pays essential attention
to the internal structure of the situation"". In Tima, the perfective and
imperfective aspects are closely related to the concept of telicity.
Consequently, verbs can be classified into a number of classes according
to the aspectual and semantic properties of the verb itself; i.e. verbs are
classified according to the concept of telicity. That is, the verb can
inherently be a telic or an atelic verb (see below). These verbs are
characterized as one of the semantic aspectual properties of the situation
or speech event.
Perfectivity indicates completed action with a beginning, middle and end.
In general the perfective aspect in Tima is marked morphologically by a181suffix '-ataŋ' on verbs 9. This suffix indicates both the perfectivity and
completion of an action, especially when it is clearly contrasted with an
imperfective form; see the examples below.

should complete doing an action/command.

The word telic originates from the Greek word 'telos' which means 'end'.
Telic verbs refer to situations which have a terminal point; i.e. the
situation has a definite end. The term telic situation corresponds to the
term 'accomplishment'; atelic verbs refer to the situations that can be
protracted indefinitely or be broken off (Lehmann, 1991).
In his book on aspect, Comrie (1976) mentioned that the distinction
between telic and atelic verbs does not involve the verb only but it also
refers to the verb together with its arguments (subject and object). This
situation also holds true for Tima, where the telicity of verbs depends
heavily on the number of arguments as well as semantic and pragmatic
properties associated with the object of a sentence. The verb in Tima can
be described as a telic verb if the object is singular, whereas the same
verb can be described as atelic and has a different form if the object is
plural; i.e. it refers to more than one entity. This usually invovles the
concept of pluractionality in Tima.

verbs. The following paragraphs will present and describe these classes of
verbs.","[202, 203, 204, 205]"
"The following are examples of verbs that contain the suffix '-ʊk/–uk'.
This means that the vowel of the separative suffix harmonizes with the
vowel of the verb root. The suffix '-ʊk/-uk' is a derivational marker which
indicates separative meaning. The examples are:

(e.g. candle)h) tiy-uk'hit solid things in order to -separates the parts (e.g.
groundnuts)'i) lelum-uk'shout'--242The suffix '-uk' shows that there is a change in a situation which is also
conveying the meaning of separation. The examples in (158) have no
simple forms.
(158)
a) hɛb-ʊk'become happy'b) hɔlɔm-ʊk'become jealous'c) puɽu-w-uk'become warm'd) dahʊ-w-ʊk'become suspicious'e) dɔdʊ-w-ʊk'become homeless'4.5.2.6 Reversive suffix '-Vl'Tima has another kind of verb that conveys the reversive meaning. These
verbs use the suffix '-Vl' to express that meaning. The reversive suffix 'Vl' is considered as a part of the verb stem which derives the reversive
meaning but it does not affect the number of argument. Moreover, the
meaning of the verb can not stand by itself unless the 'Vl' suffix is
attached to it. This suffix is not productive in Tima. It occurs in P2 in
Table (4.5) with its canonical shape of 'VC'. The suffix vowel is
determined by the root weather it should be front/back vowel or ± ATR.
Consider the following examples:243(159)
a) tʊn-ɛl'return'b) raŋk-al'crawl'c) kɔdɔnd-ɔl'role'd) na-tɔlɔl'make peace'e) ʈup-ul'bow'4.5.2.7 Verbal adjective
Having finished discussing the derivational processes with the various
suffixes or markers used in deriving verbs out of verbs (verb-to-verb
derivations in section 4.5), another grammatical mechanism related to
verbs (nominalizing of verbs into a noun as in 5.1.1 or to an adjective).
This alternative process is expressed by deriving a new category called
'verbal adjectives' (Deutscher, 2005). In this case the verb is turning into
an adjective (verb-to-adjective). This term is referred to in Indo-European
languages, for example English, as 'a participle' 27. The participle/ verbal
adjective is a verb that is used to modify a noun, for instance, as in 'the
crying girl' (Deutscher, 2005: 346).
The verbal adjective in Tima is derived from a verb root by adding two
elements to it: the stative marker 'a- (sg)/i- (pl)', which precedes the verb
root and the suffix '-Vl', which follows it (compare the Tima verbal nouns
in 5.1.1). In most cases, the verbal adjectives function as predicates, as in
(160).
27This feature of verbal adjective has been attested in a number of Semitic languages (e.g Arabic and
Hebrew) (Deutscher, 2005).","[263, 264, 265]"
"102(75) ibʌ wajɛnkɔ-kwɔlɔŋ'father's brother's childern'Having finished presenting and analyzing all the Tima noun classes and
kinship terms, we now turn to a presentation of nominal modifiers that
associate with the noun in order to form noun phrases (NPs).
3.2 Nominal modifiers
Tima has different types of nominal modifiers, such as adjectives (3.2.1),
numerals (3.2.2), non-numerals quantifiers (3.2.3), demonstratives
(3.2.4), pronominal and nominal possessive construction (3.2.5). All of
these modifiers follow the head noun which they modify. Therefore,
Tima can be classified as a head-initial language. The following sections
will describe the structure and function of each category and their relation
to the head noun in the NP.
3.2.1 Adjectives
The traditional definition of adjectives identifies them as the class of
words denoting qualities or attributes. Some languages have an open class
of adjectives as the case in English and German, whereas others have a
close class of adjectives as the case in Igbo (Kwa, Niger-Congo, Nigeria)
which has only eight. Other languages lack a distinct class of adjectives
altogether (Schachter, 1985).
In his survey of 17 languages, Dixon (1982) observed that the semantic
types which are mostly associated with adjectives are: dimension, age,103value, and human prosperity. Accordingly, Tima has an open class of
adjectives. The Tima adjectives are not obviously derived from a word of
any other category, see the examples throughout this section.
3.2.1.1 Canonical shape of adjectives
The majority of Tima adjectival roots have initial consonants. The
adjective roots are considered as bound roots. They can not stand alone in
order to give a full meaning. They must be preceded by one of the
prefixes which are determined according to the function of adjectives
(3.2.1.2).","[123, 124, 125]"

An appositional compound is defined as ""a type of non-headed/headless
compound"" (Haspelmath, 2002: 89). Tima has a number of such
compounds, which can be translated as 'one who is perfect in doing
something'. In this case the expression 'ʌkʌrʌŋ' which means 'it is perfect'
plus a verb 9 . It always carries a positive connotation. The examples are:
(64)
a) ʌkʌrʌŋ cɔɔ/ikʌrʌŋ cɔɔ'dancer/s (lit. it is perfect who dances)'b) ʌkʌrʌŋ tʊnak'singer (lit. it is perfect who sings)'c) ʌkʌrʌŋ diik'proudly walking (lit. it is perfect who walks)'9The expression 'ʌkʌrʌŋ' can be found independently in the language. It has an adjective root '-kʌrʌŋ' which means 'handsome/ beautiful'. It is used in the predicate function 'a-kʌrʌŋ/ i-kʌrʌŋ', 'it is
beautiful/ they are beautiful'. An abstract noun (adjectival noun) can be formed out of it; 'bɨkʌrʌŋ',
'beauty'.","[326, 327]"

the negation of perfective and imperfective differs with regard to the verb
forms. Both perfective and imperfective aspects are negated by the
negative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic '-Vŋ'. Therefore, in the
case of perfective aspect the negated verb takes the form of telic verbs as
in (183a) below, while in the case of imperfective aspect the negated
form takes the form of atelic verb as in (183b) (see 4.4.2.4).

According to Comrie (1976), stative situations involve no change. The
stative verbs in Tima are formed by the stative aspect marker '-a', which
is suffixed to the verbs, for instance:
(106)
a) duw-a'stand'b) tuw-ʌ'have a rest'201The stative suffix '-a' usually occurs closer to the verb root; that is why it
is inherent also on the verbal nouns which describe states. For example:
(107)
a) kʊdʊw-a'standing'b) ku-tuw-ʌ'rest'According to the literature on TAM systems, most languages divide up
their predicate phrases into two types of constructions: dynamic vs.
stative constructions. ""The dynamic construction type typically has a full
verb as its head, whereas the 'stative' construction tends to involve nouns
or adjectives in predicative function, with or without a copula functioning
as the dummy head of the predicate phrase"" (Dahl, 1985:28).
In Tima, the nouns in predicate function are not marked by any overt
marker, as in (108a and b) (i.e. in non-verbal predicates). They are
formed without the stative marker '-a'.(108)
a) Kɨdʌ-wʌkabandi1sgteacher'I am a teacher'b) kɨdʌ-wʌ
1sg-FOCku-murik
NC.sg-Tima person'I am Tima person'202The Tima stative marker '-a/-ɪ' is usually employed before adjectives in a
predicate position. Similarly, it has been found in the data that the verbal
nouns are preceded by the stative marker 'a-' in the singular/'i-' in the
plural. In this case, the nouns occur in predicate position, i.e. in the verb
slot (see 4.5.2.7). They function as verbal adjectives in order to express
stative situations in a predicate position. This shows that Tima uses nouns
in a verb slot, and in this case the noun functions as a verb (see 4.5.2.7 on
verbal adjectives). The examples are in (109), (110) and (111).

"2.2.1.5. Suppletion
By definition, suppletion is the complete (or partial) replacement of one
form by another, as in the English example of 'goes' and went' (Finegan,
2004). This type of suppletive forms is quite common in Greek verbs,
while in North American languages, the suppletive forms are common
among numbers (Matthews, 1991).
Tima has a few suppletive nouns (see 3.1.8), and a considerable number
of suppletive verbs (especially in forming the imperative forms (1sg and
2sg/pl) and with pluractional marking (see 4.4.3.1 and 4.5.1.2,
respectively).

As mentioned in 2.4 earlier, each affix or clitic on the verb adds a
semantic connotation to the basic meaning of the verbal root. The various
slots in the verb structure as shown in Table (4.1) will be briefly
described.
Slot 1 and 12 are occupied by negative markers. The negative marker in
slot 1 'kV' is considered as a proclitic which is usually fused with the
pronominal marker 'PM' (when there is no aspect marker), whereas the
negative marker in slot 12 '-Vŋ' is considered as an enclitic. Their
occurrence is obligatory when they negate a verb phrase/clause (see
Section 4.6). For example:
(4)
ka-mɔɔk-ɔŋNEGR 'drink'NEG'do not drink'
Slot 2 contains aspect and mood markers. This slot is filled by different
markers according to aspect and mood (for mood markers see Section
4.4.3.4). In the case of aspect, it is either filled by the progressive marker
'cʌ' or the stative aspect marker 'a' (Section 4.4). The aspect markers
always fuse with the person marker e.g. 'N' in slot 3 (4.3.2.1); they form a
144portmanteau morpheme as in (5). The person marker appears in the case
of the 1st person singular, 3rd person singular/plural (the person marker 'N'
harmonizes with the following consonant) and the morpheme 'na-' in the
case of 2nd person plural, see example (6).

the person marker in slot 3. Usually, these four slots combine together in

Indefinite future indicates that an action/situation will take place in the
future, but the time is unspecified. The indefinite future usually takes the

Notice that the vowel of the aspect marker 'cV-' also differs according to

'kan-t̪ɘ' with its plural counterpart 'yan-t̪ɘ' plus a noun. The compound is
considered as a headless compound. The bound form ''kan-t̪ɘ/yan-t̪ɘ'
consists of two parts; that is why they are separated by a hyphen. The first
element 'kan-/yan-' is attested elsewhere with a meaning 'thing/things'
(see type 3 above), whereas the element '-tɘ' is found with regard to
locative nouns (see 3.1.5). It means 'at/on/in'. The examples are:

close to the verb root and it is not possible for any other morpheme to
interfere between this transitive marker and the verb root. It is usually
represented by a single vowel (e.g. '-V-') which is influenced by the root
vowel harmony (for the examples see Section 4.5.1.1 on transitive
suffixes). These transitive suffixes are inherent to the verb root. This
property justifies their appearance in verbal noun forms, e.g. the transitive
suffix '-i' (see 5.1.1) and abstract nouns, e.g. the transitive suffix '-a' (see
5.1.3).
P2 involves different derivational suffixes with different functions, such
as causative, antipassive, passive, ventive, pluractional and separative
(see the section on simple derivational processes). P2 occurs slightly
more remote from the verb root, it usually is represented by a
combination of a vowel and a consonant, the canonical shapes of these
derivational suffixes is '-VC-'. In the absence of the transitive marker, it
can be closer to the root in the simple derivational process, e.g. 'ʌmbʌrɨh-ʌk', 'he washed' with the antipassive derivational suffix '-ʌk'.","[269, 270]"

'arɔŋ' which means 'like' plus the verbal nouns. This combination of
agentive nouns is formed by a kind of adjectival compound clause which
means 'who/which likes something (see 5.2 on compounding). The word
'arɔŋ' is considered as a bound morpheme because it has no meaning
when it occurs in isolation and it is not found in any other construction in
Tima. This means it is exclusively used with verbal nouns to derive
agentive nouns. Thus, the new compound nouns describe a person who
does an action unintentionally. This means that one can do/perform the
action as a habit. The others describe that person on that ground, but the
meaning usually conveys a negative connotation. The examples are:284(32)

'arɔŋ'. But some of them are nevertheless derived from verb roots. They
actually resemble the verbal nouns in their forms. Agentive nouns in this
case are different. because of the changes that concern the tone levels
(Bashir forthcoming). The agentive nouns take a low tone levels

"4.6 Verbal negation
Tima has different types of negation marking. That is, the negative
strategy in Tima involves negation of the whole clause, in which case it is
described as clausal negation. Or, alternatively, it negates some of the
clause constituents, such as nouns, adverbs, adjectives and quantifiers.
This type is described as constituent negation (Alamin forthcoming).
Negation in Tima is expressed by using different strategies; see section
2.4.1.3. On the one hand, it uses two negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in a
single clause, especially in negating the declarative and imperative
clauses. It is the most common strategy of negation marking in Tima. On
theotherhand,Timausesaninherentlynegativequantifier'amaŋaŋ'/'amaŋ', 'nothing/lack/not-exist' to indicate that the event or

Having finished describing and analyzing the different singular and plural
noun-class prefixes of Tima nouns and how they are formed, it is very
important to mention that there are variations among the Tima speakers69with regard to the use of both singular and plural classes. The following
subsection (3.1.2.2) will present the different types of these variations.
3.1.2.2 Variation between speakers
It has been observed during the fieldwork that there are phonological
variations occurring between the speakers in their use of certain forms on
the one hand, and the choice of a certain noun-class prefixes, on the other
hand. These variations are due to the age of the speaker, i.e. the
difference between old generation, mid generation and young generation
(Dimmendaal forthcoming).","[90, 91]"

end with the suffix 'ɪ-/i-' but the atelic verbs which are derived from them
are not formed by just dropping the suffix; instead the atelic verbs have
different forms. One way of forming atelic verbs out of telic verbs which
end with the suffix 'i-' is by lengthening the vowel of the root, for
example:

'say'b) muun<mun-i'insult'c) muur<mur-i'pick up'There is another case where the atelic verbs are derived from telic verbs
ending in the suffix 'i-' by changing it into a suffix '-a'. In such a case, the185suffix 'a-', which is marking atelic verbs, is considered as an imperfective
marker in Tima. It usually indicates the habitual aspect or iterativity of an
action. The examples are:

PROG.1sg-take-Tr/IMPF-1sg'I (usually) take the money'The suffix '-ɛ' is another suffix that marks telic verbs in Tima. It also
indicates that an action is directed towards a certain goal. The suffix '-ɛ'
undergoes a certain phonological operation (coalescence, Bashir
forthcoming). It is a combination of the final vowel of the verb root 'a'
and the transitive suffix '-i'. In addition, such verbs are considered as
perfective verbs. The atelic verbs are formed or derived out of these telic
verbs by changing the perfective suffix '-ɛ' into the suffix '-a', as is the
case with the suffix '-i' mentioned above, for example:(71)

unmarked, see the examples in (73).

marked by the suffix '-ɛ'. The atelic verb is formed by internal change of
the root.

depends on the vowel harmony of the verb root (i.e. ±ATR). This class of
verbs display the perfective aspect by adding the common perfective and
completive aspect marker '-ataŋ'. In a case like this, the final suffix of the
verb stem, i.e. '-ɔ' or '-u' is changed into 'a'. This phenomenon may be
considered as a kind of regressive assimilation where the first vowel of
the perfective marker affects the suffix vowel of the verb 11; see examples
below.

"27The way of marking nouns differs from languages to another. That is,
how to derive the plural from the singular or vice versa. It is found that
the base form is not fixed in African languages. According to Gilley
(2000), there are three ways of marking number in Shilluk (a Western
Nilotic, i.e. a Nilo-Saharan language): (i) the singular is considered as the
base form while the plural is marked by a suffix (i.e. the plural is derived
from the unmarked singular), (ii) the plural is the base form while the
singular is also marked by a suffix and (iii) the singular and the plural are
both marked by the process of suffixation.
This situation is also true for Laggori, a Nilo-Saharan language (Alamin,
2006). This system is known as “tripartite system”. In comparison, both
the singular and plural nouns in Tima are marked by the process of
prefixation (see 3.1). Therefore, the plural noun is derived by replacing
the singular noun class by the suitable plural noun-class prefix.
Mass nouns and collective nouns are other categories that mark the nouns
in a language. According to Haspelmath (2002), mass nouns are not
pluralized and they usually take distinctive markers from those of
countable nouns. Considering the class of mass nouns in in different
Nuba Mountains languages (Otorro, Katcha and Nyimang), Stevenson
(1956) observed that they take a distinct class (ŋ- class) from those
referring to singular and plural noun classes (Stevenson, 1956).
The semantic categorization of mass nouns varies from language to
language. It is found that in Indo-European languages, e.g. English, there
is a clear cut distinction between countable and mass nouns, but the case
is different in African languages, where there is continuum between
countable and mass nouns. In the case of Nilo-Saharan languages, it is
28possible to derive a singulative form out of inherently mass nouns by
using one of the singular markers. In Bari, a Nilo-Saharan language, it is
possible to use a singulative suffix '-tat' with a mass noun like 'lɛ', 'milk'
in order to give the form 'lɛ-tat' which means 'a drop of milk'
(Dimmendaal, 2000). This semantic dimension of mass nouns is also
found in the Tima language (see 3.1.3).
Moreover, there are nouns which are inherently plural (referred to as
collective nouns), but it is possible to derive the singular counterpart
expressing an individuated item from a collective or a group by a
singulative number affix (e.g. Baale, a Nilo-Saharan language, spoken in
southern Ethiopia and Sudan). On the other hand, languages may have
inherently singular nouns (they are referred to as singulative nouns).
Thus, one can derive a plural counterpart by attaching a plural marker.
Tima also has such inherently plural nouns (collective) and singulative
nouns (see 3.1.3.1). In addition, it has a third type referred to as singular
forms only, i.e. they do not have plural forms at all (see also 3.1.3.1).","[48, 49, 50]"
"311General Summary
This study is divided into five chapters. The following part gives a
summary of what has been described in each chapter.
Chapter one was an introductory notes which gave a brief background on
the classification of the language and the Tima community. The reasons
behind the complex linguistic situation in the Tima area were considered
with reference to the general linguistic situation in Sudan. In addition, the
chapter included some notes about the previous studies that have been
done in the Nuba Mountains; The methods of collecting the data were
illustrated, the way of presenting the data through out this study was
stated.
Chapter two has covered all the necessary information that is required in
discussing the word structure of a language like Tima. It described first
how the word is defined from a linguistic point of view (2.1.1); in
addition, the most important operations (2.2.1) that build up the words in
languages have been discussed with examples from other languages and
with reference to the Tima language as well. Sections (2.3) and (2.4)
handled the two major categories found in this language: the noun and the
verb. The major inherent grammatical categories associated with each
class have been described and discussed elaborately. The final output of
the verbal categories reveals that one can classify the language according
to the way syntactic and semantic relations are expressed; this
information may be expressed mainly on the verb, in which we are
dealing with a head-marking language at the clausal level, or,
alternatively, on noun phrases expressing different semantic roles, in
which we are dealing with a dependent-marking language (2.4.2).
312Chapter three was divided into two main sections. Section 3.1 discussed
the concept of noun classes in Tima. All productive and unproductive
noun classes of Tima have been analyzed. The number marking system
(the formation of singular and plural) of these classes has also been
illustrated. In addition, the forms of kinship terms (3.1.9) have been
presented and the way they mark the plural counterparts has been
discussed.
Section (3.2) described all the nominal modifiers as found in Tima. Their
position relative to the head noun which they modify has been shown, in
addition to their behavior with regard to the number of noun they modify.
Finally, a brief description of the NPs in Tima has been presented and the
final formula of all modifiers which are associated with nouns has been
stated.
Chapter four described, illustrated and analyzed all the morphological and
morphosyntactic features which are found in Tima so far. The chapter
starts by presenting the structure of Tima verbs. It was found that most of
the verbs are monosyllabic, in addition to a less numerous group of
disyllabic verb root. Trisyllabic verb roots are rare. In addition, the
structure of Tima verb stems has been presented, which contains, in
addition to the verbal root, other affixes or clitics. The presence of these
affixes or clitics on the verb forms the complex structure of the Tima
verbs. The stem/verb-word consisted of 12 slots, all together forming the
verb as a phonological and grammatical word. This complexity of verbs
has enabled us to classify the Tima as a typically head-marking language
at the clause level.","[332, 333, 334]"
"On the otherhand, mood may be marked by using auxiliaries as the case in English.
The situation in Tima is similar to the former type, where the Tima
imperative and the indicative are morphologically unmarked (i.e. carry a
zero morpheme), the subjunctive mood is morphologically marked on
38verb by a prefix (i-). Certainty is marked by a proclitic on verbs (kV-)
(see 4.4.3). In addition, the interrogative mood is also marked by a
particle on the verb or in the final position of a clause; it is mainly a
vowel.
In the preceding paragraphs, each category of tense, aspect and mood was
taken and discussed independently from each other. But there is a very
important fact that linguists should pay great attention to when doing
their linguistic fieldwork. The fact is that there is an overlap between
tense, aspect and mood as grammatical categories of the verb. They
usually act together in the inflection system of a language and it is often
difficult to tease them apart (Payne, 1997). More precisely, Katamba
(1993:223) states that ""the categories of tense, aspect and mood are not
entirely independent of each other. So they are often simultaneously
signaled by the same form. For instance, an event that is already
completed at the moment of speaking is also in the past tense …"".
This is also true for Tima, where the morphological markers of tense,
aspect and mood can not be separated from each other. For instance, The
Tima perfective aspect form which indicates the completion of an action
is also used in reference to the past tense. Likewise, the Tima
imperfective aspect form (including the progressive and habitual aspect)
which indicates the noncompletion of an action is also used in reference
to the present. Moreover, the form of certainty mood which indicates the
temporal nature of a linguistic utterance is also used with reference to the
future tense (see 4.4.1.1) and it also interacts with the aspectual form
indicating incomplete action (i.e. imperfective aspect).","[59, 60]"

The agentive nouns in Tima can be classified into three types according
to their semantic structure: (i) agentive nouns that describe a person who
does the action intentionally, (ii) agentive nouns that describe one who
does an action unintentionally and (iii) the one who does an action as a
profession. Each type has its own way of forming the agentive nouns. In
most cases, agentive nouns are derived from verbs. In other cases, they
are formed by adding a bound morpheme (e.g. arɔŋ, 'like') which
sometimes carry a negative connotation. A few Tima agentive nouns do
not seem to be derived from any other word classes; i.e. they are nouns by
themselves that express an occupation or profession.
281Type 1: Agentive nouns with 'kay'The agentive nouns that fall in this class are derived mainly from verb
roots. The element 'kay' precedes the verb form expressing the action.
The action nouns are the same as verbal nouns. Thus, the agentive nouns
are formed by adding 'kay' to the verbal/action nouns 3 . The construction
of agentive noun in this case indicates that the agent is doing the action
intentionally. The examples are:
(28)
ANglossVNglossa) kay mɔhɔl'one who has evil eye' mɔhɔl'magic'b) kay kʊhʊrɛɛl'slaughterer'kʊhʊrɛɛl'slaughtering (feast)'c) kay katʊkwɛɛl'hunter'katʊkwɛɛl'hunting'd) kay kuturuweel 'swimmer'kuturuweel 'swimming'e) kay wuri'fighter/hero'kuri'force/power'f) kay ɽumeel'killer/murder'kutumeel'killing'g) kay ʊranɪɪ'runner'kʊɽanɪɪ'running'It is noticed that the last three examples in (28) above (the verbal nouns
with the element 'kay') undergo certain phonological changes when
compared with the other verbal nouns in the third column. That is. there
is a deletion of the initial consonant 'k' of the verbal noun when forming
the agentive nouns (Bashir forthcoming).
It has been noticed that the word 'kay' is combined with the noun, the tone levels are usually different
(this is a general remark during the fieldwork). The verbal nouns take high tone when they are used in3isolation, whereas the same verbal nouns take low tone levels when the word 'kay' is used ( Bashir
forthcoming).","[301, 302, 303]"

/a-/ʌ-/and /i-/ɪ-/are dropped. This prefix might mean ""move from ten
onwards"" or it means ""plus"".
The numbers from 20 to 100 are simply formed by multiplicative of 10.

Tima has no complete set of ordinals. There are only two distinctive
ordinal numbers: 'kɪɲɛr', 'the first' and 'alakɔ', 'the last'. The other ordinal
numbers are formed in the same way as the cardinal numerals are done.","[135, 136]"
"2.2 The structure of words
As mentioned above, the word can be viewed as strings of sounds
associated with meaning. This is clear if one tries to analyze a word like
'rats', where it consists of a phonological sequence 'rat' and 's'. The
meaning of this form is decomposable into two parts: semantically it
refers to a class of small rodents and it refers to plurality. The structure of
the word 'rat+s' is transparent; but the situation is more complicated and
difficult with regard to another example like 'mice' with its singular
counterpart 'mouse'. It is clear here that only the /m/ at the beginning and
/s/ at the end are shared between the two forms. The problem occurs with
regard to the idea of plurality. The plurality is expressed inside the word18(internally) by the process of a vowel alternation. One can explain the
relation between 'mouse' and 'mice' as follows: the vowel /ai/ marks the
singular and /au/ marks the plural. Thus, the formula in this case is that
the plural is formed by replacing /ai/ with /au/. This relation forms the
word's shape and structure (Anderson, 1985a).
The two examples of rats and mice show that the word is structured by
different operations referred to as 'morphological processes' (such as
vowel alternations, affixes, etc). They usually reflect the grammatical
categories of the word (such as number, case, tense, aspect, etc.). These
morphological processes share in building up the structure of word
(Matthews, 1991). The following paragraphs will handle each of these
morphological processes in details and show how they share in word
structure in general and in Tima in particular.","[39, 40]"
"The subjunctive form in Tima is formed by the prefix 'i-' for the 1st person
plural inclusive on the verb. This subjunctive mood in Tima is also clear
in the negative subjunctive mood (see also 4.6). They express weak
obligations. It is highly productive and systematic. The examples are:

following formula.a) 1st pl incl:ɪ-stem
2084.4.3.3 Indicative mood
Indicative mood is used to assert a proposition as a fact. It is also referred
to as declarative mood (Whaley, 1997). The indicative mood in Tima is
morphologically unmarked. It constitutes the most basic sentence type.
Therefore, it is not marked for modality.
The indicative form in Tima is unmarked morphologically.The common
word order for indicative sentences is SVO as in (119). Tima has another
word order according to the focusing/topicalization on certain
constituents of a sentence. The other word orders are: OV(S) as in (120),
VSO or SOV (Dimmendaal, 2009) 16.

It is used to show the speaker's certainty about the occurrence of an
action. In Tima, the so-called certainty mood/form is marked by the
proclitic 'kV' which usually precedes the future marker 'dV-' in the
sentence. The full paradigm of certainty mood is shown in (121).

which is a widespread phenomenon among languages, for example
English. In a case like this, the future-like interpretation depends on the
nature of the described situation and it is also understood from the
context. Therefore, the future marker 'dV-' in this case disappears from
the verb form (see the present tense in section 4.4.1.2.2). The examples in
(33) express that the speaker is departing, or about to leave. In addition,
the examples in (33) have another interpretation, that is the sentence
indicates the present tense; it can also indicate the habitual aspect by
adding the adverb 'ʈɔʈɔk'.","[183, 184]"
"5.1.1.1 Tima verbal noun classes
The Tima verbal nouns are classified by taking into consideration the
endings of the verbal nouns compared with the verb stem as found, for
example, in the imperative form. The imperative forms are given for the 2
person singular only as a simpler form compared with the verbal noun
suffix '-Vl'. Accordingly, Tima has six verbal nouns classes as follows:Class A: Verbal nouns with the suffix '-ʊl/-ul'This class contains examples of verbal nouns that are characterized as
being both intransitive and transitive in their verb roots. It can be noticed
266that the imperative transitive forms do not have any transitive marker and
most of them end with a consonant sound, therefore the suffix '-ʊl/-ul' is
attached directly to the verb stem. The examples are:(2)

they predominantly refer to process/action verbs. The class includes both
intransitiveandtransitiveverbs.","[287, 288]"
"2.4.1.5 Pluractional
In the preceding paragraphs the different types of DAs have been
presented. Pluractional marking is also considered as part of the
derivational operations taking place on the verb. But because of its weight
on the verbal morphology of African languages, separate paragraphs are
devoted to introduce and explain this phenomenon. Pluractional is
sometimes referred to as 'number in verb' (Bybee, 1985), 'verbal number'
(Creissels, 2008), or 'plural verb/iterative' (Abu Manga, 1986). It is well
known that nouns/nominals are inflected for number either as singular or
as plural. But there are some languages in which number distinctions are
expressed on the verb.
Pluractional marking usually involves the multiplicity of subjects, objects
or the repetitition of an action itself (Williamson and Blench 2000). For
42this aspect of plurality marking on verbs the term “pluractional” is coined
by Newman (1990) in his study of Chadic verbs (e.g. Kanakuru
language). Such phenomena are also widespread in Niger-Congo
languages. Aaron (1994) has studied verbal number in Obolo (BenueCongo language). He states that languages in general follow different
processes for expressing pluractionals on verbs. Examples of these
processes are: by way of affixes that are attached to the verb root, full or
partial reduplication of the verb root/stem, internal change of the verb
stem, or by using supletive verb forms to indicate plurality. The last
process, i.e. suppletive form is described by Bybee (1985) in her survey
of some languages of the world. She found that in Kung, a language of
southern Africa, there are two forms of verbs. One form is used when the
subject/object is singular and the other form is used when the
subject/object of a sentence is plural.
Likewise, pluractional marking is considered as a prominent feature of
Tima verbal morphology. It uses the same processes mentioned above for
expressing plurals in verbs (see 4.5.1.2). One of the most important facts
is the fact that plurality in Tima does not play only a role on the verb
derivational morphology but is also considered as a major feature in
distinguishing imperfective from perfective aspect. This is due to the fact
that verbal plurality has an inherent meaning of the verb (see 4.4.2.3 on
perfective vs. imperfective).","[63, 64]"
