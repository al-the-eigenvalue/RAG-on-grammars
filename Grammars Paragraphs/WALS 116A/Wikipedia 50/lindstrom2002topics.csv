"Both the above are by the same speaker, in the same narrative. The following
example, by a different speaker, contains a question-word question with a
similar contour to the previous two examples, as well as a yes/no question.
Yes/no questions have a very distinctive sharp pitch rise on the last syllable (or,
when present, on a final particle a which can be added when a positive answer
is expected). The example is from a story of a man who finds an unknown boy
at his homestead and tries to find out who he is:

"13TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTkum, adverb), ‘be where’ (lak-, adjective), ‘when; how many’ (namuk, adverb).
Mani ‘what’ has the form man when used together with a noun (man kukuom?
‘what/which tree?’). ‘How’ is expressed by ‘like what’, are mani, and ‘why’ by
‘for what’, me mani.
Aka ‘who’ and mani ‘what’ tend to be topicalised (fronted), but can be left in
the normal position of the item asked about; the interrogative adverbs lakum
and namuk can be topicalised too (namuk is usually topicalised in the sense
‘when’). When fronted, question words are treated the same as other constituents and the construction is marked with the relator lǝ. Question-word questions
have their own intonation contour (see 3.6.).
The interrogative nouns and adverbs have indefinite uses corresponding to
‘whoever’, ‘whatever’, ‘wherever’, ‘whenever/however-many’. Mani can further be used as a negator as described in 1.1.7 above.
Yes/no questions are marked only by intonation; primarily a sharp rise on the
last syllable (see 3.6). If an affirmative answer is expected a tag a can be added
to the end of the sentence – this then carries the high pitch. In replying, aa ‘yes’
to a question in negative polarity confirms the proposition including the negation (i.e., ‘yes’ to the question ‘Won’t you come tomorrow?’ means that the
person will not come).
1.1.8.3 Tense/irrealis
The only temporal distinction that is consistently marked in Kuot is future vs.
non-future. The category called future here could also be analysed as irrealis,
but each analysis has some problems and I have chosen to use the label “future”
for this grammatical category. There are two expressions of future: the particle
e(ba), and some verbal morphology (see 1.1.2 above).
The future morphological alternations are the only marking of imperative (in
positive polarity). They are sometimes also the only expression of immediate
future. They are further triggered by the use of the future particles e (immediate
future) or eba (future), and are optionally used after the auxiliary verb -ga
‘want; be about to’.
Eba in turn has several contexts of use. It always conditions future verbal morphology. In addition to plain future temporal reference, it is used to mark a kind
of procedural habitual; in clause complements of the preposition me as mentioned above; in clause complements of the verb puo ‘be able to’ (with the relator lǝ); and optionally in if–then constructions (more often in the ‘then’ clause
but possible in either or both).
Future morphology and eba do not co-occur with several types of negation: the
future negator tǝla, the prohibitive marker buat, and the apprehensive marker
bun (and related forms).
1.2
Kuot as a linguistic type
Predicate-initial languages are rare in the region, and Kuot is possibly unique
among non-Austronesian (Papuan) languages in this respect.
14INTRODUCTION: KUOT AS A LINGUISTIC TYPEThe Polynesian outlier languages of Takuu (Mortlock) and Nukuria (Fead) in
Bougainville Province (Papua New Guinea) are probably VSO since this is the
dominant structure in Polynesian languages, but I have no specific information
on these.10 The nearest other VSO language would be Austronesian Roviana in
the New Georgia island group in the Solomon Islands. Surrounding Austronesian languages on New Ireland are all SVO. As regards other non-Austronesian
languages in the region, most seem to be SVO (Baining, Taulil and Butam,
Sulka, Kol, Ata and Anêm in New Britain, and Bilua in the Solomon Islands;
Taulil seems to have the option VS for some stative clauses), or SOV (Rotokas,
Nasioi, Buin and Motuna on Bougainville, and Lavukaleve, Savosavo and Touo
(Baniata) in the Solomon Islands).11 Non-Austronesian (Papuan) languages on
New Guinea island are predominantly verb-final.
Although word order may not always be the best indicator of other structures in
a language, it may be interesting to look at how various features in Kuot pattern
together.
In Greenberg’s first formulation of word order universals (Greenberg 1990
[1963]), a harmonic VSO language should have the features given in the lefthand column in Table 3 (which is not exhaustive – only the major and most often quoted features are included). In terms of these features, Kuot shows up as a
harmonic language, matching all the major features, as indicated by pluses in
the second column.

April 2002).
11 Unfortunately, most of these languages are as yet very incompletely described. Inmost cases I have gleaned the information from a few reproduced sentences, so it is
not certain that these are representative of a larger sample. Only for Bilua and Lavukaleve did I have access to full grammars: Terrill (1999) for Lavukaleve and Obata
(2000) for Bilua.","[34, 35, 36]"
"Intonation is high across the phrase, and there is a rise on the last syllable (although the /i/ in -sik is very short in the second instance), a common way of
signalling topicalisation in Kuot (cf. 3.6 below). The relative difference in dura-116PHONOLOGY: INTONATIONtion in the first two syllables of the words remains although the intonational
prominence is on -sik.
In summary, pitch is used primarily for intonation (the topic of the next section), while word stress is achieved primarily through duration.
Stress shift is occasionally an exponent of a grammatical category. This is the
case for future forms of some class II verbs (the future particle e(ba) would
normally have to be present too), e.g.:
(88)i-abǝ ['jabǝ]
i-aba [ja'ba]3fS-climb – she climbs/climbed
3fS-climb.fut – she (will) climbA further factor concerning stress is that some grammatical morphemes often,
but not always, attract stress. In particular, this concerns the non-singular suffix
-(i)p on nouns, and the subject enclitics of verb class I. As mentioned in 3.3.1, a
possible analysis for the contrasting pairs duk ‘1. break (of rope), 2. thunder’,
and ut ‘1. be full, 2. be like’ could be that one member in each pair carries inherent stress. It was shown for duk that the sense ‘thunder’ gave a longer word
when carrying the subject enclitic than the sense ‘break’ (at least in the two instances recorded); this could be due to the combination of two stressed syllables. Interactions of these kinds are complex, and detailed analysis is beyond
the scope of the present study.
3.6
Intonation
In many languages, yes/no questions and non-finality are signalled by pitch
(typically by a rise at the end of the utterance). Kuot does this, but goes further,
and has specific intonation patterns for several more clause types, where each of
the specialised pitch contours, or tunes, pertains to a particular function or
clause type. The most salient intonation patterns in Kuot are
• declarative, non-final (rising; including topicalised constituents)
• declarative, final (falling)
• negated clause
• question-word question
• yes/no question
Each of these will be illustrated by pitch curves generated from recorded narrative speech (including cited speech for questions). The genre imposes some
limitations on data; for example I think that clarification questions and echo
questions would differ from those reported below (but unfortunately I have no
recorded conversational material). Within the genre, however, the observations
appear quite stable. Pitch extractions were performed in response to the auditory
impression that “there was something going on with intonation in negated
clauses” (etc.), and the impression was borne out in the first few examples that117TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTwere analysed instrumentally. The results remained stable when checked
against equivalent constructions from other speakers.16
The transcription in figures is phonemic but with lenition applied, as this can
influence pitch.
The pitch of a non-final clause rises, often quite sharply, on the last syllable of
the intonation unit, while final clause intonation usually consists in a fall over
the last few syllables, as seen in Figure 6, which shows the pitch extraction for
example (89) with a rise on todǝŋ and a fall over the clitics =ieŋ=arǝ:
(89)[Li-la=rǝ
dus=lioŋ] todǝŋ, kale=ieŋ=arǝ.
3dS-go=ASP stand=3dS down sing.out=3fS=ASP
‘They went (and) stood below, she called out.’Figure 6: Non-final and final intonation (female speaker: KD).","[138, 139, 140]"
"From the examples given above, it would appear that pitch in Kuot is tied up
with expressing clause type to the extent that other uses are largely blocked; in
particular, as we have seen, stress is expressed by duration rather than pitch.
Regarding paralinguistic meanings such as surprise and anger, the absence of
observations may be a direct effect of the type of data: narrative monologue is
likely to have significantly less emotive expression than dialogue. Cruttenden
expresses doubt about the type of association between sentence type and tune
that I have tried to demonstrate for Kuot:
In some languages (not English) […] the use of particular tunes is closely tied to
functional sentence-types, e.g. where statement, yes/no question, and command
regularly involve certain tunes. From most of the descriptions of intonation in
languages other than English, one might imagine that this was the principal use
of various tunes in intonation languages. It may indeed be true that many languages do use intonation less for attitudinal purposes than English, but the suspicion exists that an alignment of tunes with sentence-types is merely the easy way
to investigate intonation and often more sophisticated attitudinal and discoursal
uses remain undocumented. (Cruttenden 1986: 10)I would argue that the patterns found in Kuot are valid at least for the narrative
genre, but agree that more detailed analysis is needed, in several areas. It is
likely that more patterns can be found, associated with other clause types (for
example, imperative, prohibitive and relative clauses are areas yet to be investigated). Ladd (2001: 1383) makes the observation that languages may use the
same tune in several functions (as in Kuot’s use of rising pitch for both topicalisation and other kinds of non-finality), and also points out that languages appear
to vary in the number of tunes that they make use of. What seems extraordinary
about Kuot is the degree of specialisation of tunes, perhaps especially in func122PHONOLOGY: OTHER SPEECH SOUNDS, HESITATION AND EMPHASIStions that are also expressed lexically, such as question-word questions and negation. Investigation into further clause types and functions may show some recurrence of tunes, or it may expand the inventory of tunes even further.
Other related areas for further research include: the expression of prominence
on particular constituents, such as new information and contrastive focus, and
the interaction of such features with clause intonation; the expression of attitude; genre-related variation; and meta-linguistic parameters such as politeness
(which, impressionistically, is expressed by speaking softly).
3.7
Other speech sounds, hesitation and emphasis
There are a number of phenomena that are not part of the phonology as such,
but which nevertheless deserve mention here. They are brought together in this
section.
An alternative but relatively infrequent way of expressing ‘yes’ (normally aa) is
on an ingressive pulmonic airstream. There are two variants. First, it can be
done with pursed lips; this produces a faintly whistling sound. Secondly, it can
be done with relaxed lips and vocal tract and mid-open jaw position, with voicing from about halfway through (like saying /ha/ or /hǝ/ while breathing in).
A further sound that is not part of the phonological system is a bilabial trill
([B]). This is produced by pulling the corners of the mouth to the sides and a
little bit down, and briefly emitting air between the lips. It has only one use:
‘no’ or ‘I don’t know’ between people who know each other, and is particularly
favoured by children.
Glottal stops occur in some exclamations and in hesitation, without being part
of the phonological system. Both the word for ‘yes’, aa, and a general exclamation of surprise or consternation, e (or eh), are frequently produced with glottal
stops, either at the beginning or the end or both. An eʔ with a glottal stop also
often signals self-repair – the speaker breaks off his or her utterance with eʔ!
and then starts the repair. Repairs have not yet been the subject of close study,
but one common strategy in conversation is breaking off the utterance with eʔ,
then repeating the inappropriate lexeme often followed by gǝt ‘again’ with
question intonation, then filling in the correct word.
There are several patterns of hesitation. Most speakers have frequent brief
pauses, sometimes between clauses, but also in between elements of the same
clause or phrase (such as in the third graph of Figure 7). Some but not all speakers recorded have filled pauses, using vowels such as [ǝ] or [ɛ]. Longer pauses
are very frequently filled by filler words while the speaker searches for the right
lexeme; typically any phrase-initial grammatical material will be produced first,
and then the filler takes the place of the lexical item, while the speaker searches
for the correct word. The fillers are: an ambitransitive class III verb mat-bǝ for
verbs and adjectives, with full agreement marking; and a noun mare/maro
(masc./fem; dl: marǝpien, nsg: marǝp) for nominals, i.e., nouns and personal
names. This noun is sometimes used as a normal noun with the sense ‘thing’,
and is unique among Kuot nouns in having separate forms for masculine and
123TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTfeminine singular, and there is even a special form marǝn for place names. Both
the filler predicate and the filler nominal are then usually replaced by the right
form, often with a copy of the intonation used with the filler. Sometimes the
filler is left in place without correction or specification; in other cases the right
word is filled in directly or after several intervening syllables.
Emphasis is a complex phenomenon, and no typology will be attempted here.
Without further analysis, I will simply point to two salient expressions of it in
Kuot: lengthening and articulatory energy. Emphasis is often expressed through
lengthening of a segment. Usually, this is the segment with the most relevant
semantic content for the context, but occasionally other segments in the structure receive lengthening. In the following example and figure, the speaker is
telling of his grandfather who was a phenomenal bird catcher, and at this point
comes to find his net full of birds. The elongated segment is the second syllable
of kukuom ‘tree’ (possibly because it is phrase-final), which has a duration of
0.6 seconds. It is also spoken at quite a high pitch for a male speaker, around
220 Hz:
(97)Dak=ieŋ
kukuom ga [nǝmo
kkof=meŋ] muareip
be.full=3fS tree(f)
and be.about.to break=3pS branch.nsg
‘The tree was full and the branches were about to break’Figure 14: Emphasis by lengthening (male speaker: SEL).","[144, 145, 146]"
"120PHONOLOGY: INTONATIONQuestion-word questions (content questions or WH questions) too have their
special intonation pattern, rising on the first syllable, flattening out and then
falling again on the last syllable. The following two examples show how this
pattern remains constant in spite of the different position of the question word
itself in each of the utterances:
(94)“Mimi aka tie?”.
2p

‘“Who are you(pl) there?”’Figure 11: Question-word question intonation (female speaker: KD).

"9TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTAll the stems in this set (in their simple or complex form) can be affixed with
third person prefixes and used as demonstratives (cf. 1.1.1 above). Note the
difference in use as locational/directional vs. demonstrative:
(14)u-on\ma tie
3mS-sit there
‘he sits/sat there’(locational, adverbial use)(15)u-on\ma i-tie
3mS-sit 3m-there
‘he/that one sits/sat’(demonstrative, nominal use)(16)u-on\ma [i-tie
mikana]
3mS-sit 3m-there man
‘the/that man sits/sat’(demonstrative, adnominal use)1.1.6
Adverbs and adverbial clitics
There is a fairly rich set of adverbs in Kuot, covering categories such as time
and manner. Some appear to be related to words in other word classes, and
many end in /t/ which may at one stage have been an adverb-forming derivation, but there is synchronically no productive way of forming adverbs. Adverbs
are invariant in form, and relatively free in syntactic terms, although there is a
preference for the second position in the predicate.
There is also a set of six adverbial enclitics which attach to the first constituent
in the phrase to which they belong (and thereby provide a nice criterion for
phrase-hood). The continuous aspect particle mǝn is not counted when “first
constituent” is sought. The enclitics have meanings such as ‘just’, ‘now’, ‘still;
yet; first’, ‘emphatic’ (example (17)), ‘also’ and ‘a little’ (example (18)). The
aspect enclitic =rǝ occurs in the same a lot as the adverbial clitics, but is mutually incompatible with them.
1.1.7
Negation
There are several types of negation in Kuot, and most have an association with
non-future verbal morphology, even in future temporal reference. The most
general negator is tǝle, which negates any type of predicate. It occurs before the
negated constituent:
(17)Tǝle=kan
[u-me
ubi]
NEG=EMPH 3mS-HAB work=Ø
‘He didn’t use to work’(18)tǝlekakarat, kakkaliat=arokan.
NEG near
far=a.little(.more)
‘it wasn’t near, it was rather far.’There is a variant tǝla which is used in future contexts (with non-future verbal
morphology).
An interesting alternative for general negation is mani, normally the question
word ‘what’. It is particularly common in the northern Kuot-speaking area. The
use as a negation appears to have developed from an ironic formulation (something like ‘you think what, he worked??’ meaning ‘he didn’t work’), and retains
10INTRODUCTION: GRAMMATICAL OVERVIEWtraces of question intonation. It also differs from tǝle in that tǝle is part of the
phrase it negates, as evidenced by the placement of adverbial clitics like =kan
‘EMPH’ (as in (17)), while mani is not:
(19)mani u-la=kan
u-onǝma
what 3mS-go=EMPH 3mS-sit
‘he didn’t go and sit down’The negative existential karuk ‘is.not’ or ‘there isn’t’ is also used as ‘no’. In the
negative existential use, the thing which is not is sometimes expressed with the
preposition me ‘to, for’, but more often with a PossI possessive, as in this example:
(20)Karuk=kan ma
lop
is.not=EMPH 3p.PossI child.nsg
‘There are no children here’tiro
hereThe types of negation so far mentioned are associated with a particular intonation contour (see 3.6).
Prohibitive (i.e. negative imperative) is expressed by the particle buat7, which is
also used with non-future forms (while imperative in positive polarity is expressed only by future forms of the verbal morphology, where available):
(21)Buatma-mi-lo!
PROHIB 3pO-2pS-tell
‘Don’t tell them!’butMa-mi-loa!
3pO-2pS-tell.fut
‘Tell them!’The apprehensive marker bun (and related forms), sometimes translated ‘lest’,
is also used with non-future verbal morphology:
(22)U-rau,
nǝmo bun me-nǝmu-a
ga me-o.
3mS-be.afraid COMPL APPR 3pS-kill-3mO and 3pS-eat.3sO
‘He was afraid lest they kill and eat him.’(The future forms of the verbs here would be me-nǝmu-ŋ and me-oŋ.)
1.1.8
Clauses
A clause can minimally consist of a verb (or adjective) with cross-referencing
morphology. Clauses with two full noun phrases do occur but not very often,
one or zero being more common.
The unmarked constituent order in Kuot is predicate-initial with optional noun
phrases for core arguments: V (S) (O). Subject and object are cross-referenced
by affixes/enclitics on the verb:
(23)o-ikat=oŋ
Adam [muabari
3fO-check=3mS A.
sun/clock(f)
‘Adam checked his watch’aŋ]
3m.PossII.s(24)[nǝmo o-u-uluan]
[i-tie
non
kuraima]
nirobu
want 3fO-3mS-follow 3m-there ‘some’ bush.spirit(m) coconut.palm(f)
‘this bush spirit wanted to follow the coconut palm (up)’7 Buat is homonymous with and possibly related to the particle marking habitual.","[30, 31, 32]"
"125TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTphological one.18 However, the use of forms that sound like 3mS.fut appears to
have spread from verb class II, where the subject markers are prefixes, to verb
class III where they occur medially, in particular in the verb ‘come’:
(101) mu-na-oŋ [munoŋ]J [muoŋ]come! (come-2sS.fut-stm2)Another interpretation of the same data is of course that third person address
has been used to children, and that the initial /n/ of some other words has been
dropped either independently or by phonological analogy with the class II
verbs. Third person address is otherwise not used in Kuot.
A further area where adults often adapt their speech when speaking to small
children is in intonation, particularly in yes/no questions, where the rise on the
final syllable can often be as much as a musical fifth or even more.
3.9
Phonological treatment of foreign words
The vast majority of foreign words to enter Kuot come in via Tok Pisin. Those
that are English-derived have already undergone a large measure of adaptation
to local phonologies.
Consonant clusters are dealt with in terms of epenthesis (e.g. school J sikul;
spear J supia), or reduction (e.g. trousers J rausis; needle J nil). Diphthongs
are frequently simplified too (e.g. boat J bot; day J de). Tok Pisin has fewer
phonemes than English, and there is regular mapping as follows:
(102) z
ʃ
tʃ
ʤ
θ
ðJ
J
J
J
J
Js
s
s(i)
s(i)
t
tkerosene
dish
matches
German
think
brotherJ
J
J
J
J
Jkerosin
dis
masis
Siaman
tingting (reduplicated)
brataKuot phonological restrictions and processes then apply (somewhat variously as
we shall see) to the words used in Kuot. Although all speech sounds needed for
Tok Pisin are present in Kuot, their phonemic status is different. As we have
seen, Kuot does not allow initial [r], final [l], initial or final [v], or final voiced
stops. The local Tok Pisin does not have final voiced stops, but particularly /r/
and /l/ are common in positions not allowed in Kuot. The treatment of these
varies with several factors: the level of integration of the word into Kuot, the
age of the speaker, and the speaker’s perception of the listener. The more integrated the word and the older the speaker, the more likely it is that the adaptation to Kuot phonology will take place. On the other hand, speakers are more
likely to retain features of the original pronunciation when speaking to people
who do not know the language well. Examples of adaptation are:18 Morphological simplification does occur for some verbs of classes I and (to someextent) III, mainly through omission of the subject marker; there is also some special
vocabulary in both verbs and nouns used when addressing children.","[147, 148]"
"Part of his definition of intonation is
… Intonation is used for a variety of purposes: for marking grammatical boundaries (phrases and clauses), for signalling sentence types (e.g., statements and
questions), and for conveying the speaker’s attitude (surprise, irony, anger, etc.).",[144]
"133TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOT4.1.10 Demonstratives
Semantics: Exophoric deixis (pointing in physical space); encode location,
proximity, or direction, of an entity with respect to the deictic centre. Also
many anaphoric uses; some stems are restricted to this function, and some stems
have temporal meaning. Third person only; also function as third person pronouns.
Morphology: 1. Simple demonstratives: deictic invariant forms indexing third
person masculine, feminine, dual and plural.
2. Composite demonstratives consisting of: the simple demonstratives prefixed
to A) simple or complex forms from the paradigm of locationals and directionals; or B) to stems only used in the demonstrative paradigm.
Syntax: Head of noun phrase; or determiner, normally preceding the head.
Indicate location of an entity, in predicate use in verbless constructions.
Sub-classes: 1. Simple stems, indexing third person categories; 2. Stems used
only in composite forms (making up the second part of the form).
4.1.11Particles, adverbial and aspectual clitics, conjunctions, and
interjections
This heading subsumes a varied group of forms, which are brought together
here by virtue of being short and invariant and having mainly grammatical
functions, although on other criteria they form multiple classes. The headings in
the following indicate the categorisations.
Particles in the predicate:
 tense (e, eba, ba FUTure; procedural habitual; ‘if’, ‘then’)
 aspect (mǝn CONTinuous, buat HABitual)
 mood (lǝma ‘if’)
 for NEGation, negative existential, PROHIBitive, and APPRehensive.
Particles in the noun phrase: Specificity (non, ba).
Other particles: ORDinal numeral.
There are six adverbial clitics and one aspectual clitic (=arǝ), all of which attach to the first constituent of their phrase.
Conjunctions: ga ‘and’, pa ‘but’, o ‘or’, lǝ RELator, me ‘for, to (prep.)’.
Interjections: karuk ‘no’, aa ‘yes’; also words such as mikat (adv.) ‘true!’, kuot
‘what, really?!’, me (prep. ‘for, to’) ‘why?!’.
The language further has pronominal enclitics and pronominal and other affixes. The interrelations of the various types of forms in Kuot will be discussed
in terms of cohesion and dependency in the following section.
4.2
Morphology
Kuot morphology is mainly agglutinative, with some morphologically conditioned phonological processes across morpheme boundaries. Affixes and encli134WORD CLASSES AND OVERVIEW OF MORPHOLOGY: MORPHOLOGYtics mark subject on verbs and adjectives; and affixes mark object, reciprocal
and reflexive on verbs, as well as agreement on demonstratives and prepositions. Suffixes indicate non-singular and dual on nouns. Enclitics further express aspect and several adverbial meanings; these cliticize to the first constituent in a phrase. There are also particles with various grammatical functions. Reduplication is partly productive in verb class I. Synchronically, there is no compounding of stems. Three morphological categories are expressed (at least in
part) through stem-internal changes: future stem forms in verb classes II and III;
plural formation of nouns, and nominalisation of verbs of classes II and III and
of adjectives.
The bulk of productive affixal morphological marking is thus concerned with
the categories of number, gender and the person. Derivation is not prominent in
Kuot, and the only productive derivational morphology in the language derives
action nominals from verbs of classes II and III (e.g., nulibap ‘crying’ from
class II -liba ‘cry’) and adjectives (e.g., sasarapunim ‘wetness, moisture’ from
sasarap- ‘wet’); and class I verbs from adjectives.
This section discusses the types of morphemes that can be distinguished in
Kuot: stems, affixes, clitics and particles, and possessives (which fall outside
these categories). They are investigated in terms of phonological and morphological dependency and form variability. It will be seen that although the traditional morphological categories provide a framework for categorising the types
of morphemes, they do not give a sufficiently detailed grid to capture the full
variation found in Kuot morphology.2
It was found that applying criteria of morphological dependency to all morphemes in the language would give results that are not very useful for characterising the morphemes in question. Ranging the morphemes from most independent to most dependent would give something like the following (selected morphemes):
INDEPENDENTadverbs, particles
nouns (singular)
verb class I
clitics
verb classes II and III, adjectives, affixes.
DEPENDENTIt is particularly unsatisfactory to have lexical stems with the affixes. This situation arises because stems of verb classes II and III and adjectives are bound
forms, requiring affixes (and incomprehensible to native speakers in un-affixed
form). Morphologically, they are as bound as the affixes themselves. It was
therefore decided to investigate stems separately from other morphemes. The
2 One type of morphology that will not be discussed here is reduplication, and the stemaugment in the locational/directional paradigm will also not be considered here.","[155, 156, 157]"

glossed examples from text, separated by hyphens where possible (for some of
the words above: luaga-p bench-nsg ‘benches’ and ŋof-up nostril-nsg ‘nostrils’.3 The noun to which it is attached will be given with the final segment of
the singular form unaltered, i.e., /t/ and /n/ will be written as such, even where
the non-singular ending alters the pronunciation to [r] and [l] (e.g. kit-ip [kirip]

non-singular forms will be given without hyphens and with the phonological
processes for /t/ and /n/ applied, as in (6).
In the column for dual forms, R (regular) means that the dual is formed on the
non-singular by addition of -ien as shown in (2) above. The absence of R means
that I have no information on dual for the word in question. Where I am aware
of duals formed in other ways, the full form will be given.
There are two types of exceptions to the regular formation of non-singular and
dual, which will be discussed after the presentation of the special declensions.
First, as mentioned, some nouns form non-singular on other patterns which cut
across declensions, with 20 words forming non-singular ending in bip, and a
few other smaller patterns; some words are simply irregular and do not conform
to any pattern (see 5.3). Second, there is a group of human nouns which often
have alternative dual and plural forms which pattern differently from other irregular words, and refer to different constellations of referents from the regularly formed words (see 5.4).
Regardless of the type of formation, a Kuot non-singular noun always ends in
/p/.","[173, 174]"
"95TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTsame sense is expressed with nǝmo five times (in the same text, nǝmo also
stands for ‘say’ ten times). The generational factor is present in the pronunciation of the place name Namatanai (further south in New Ireland), which older
speakers often pronounce [lamatanaj] whereas younger speakers use an initial
[n].4
The local preposition na ‘in, at’ is always pronounced as [na] ~ [nǝ], but is
likely to bear a relation to the first part of several inherently locative nouns
which do not take a local preposition, e.g. lǝbinim ‘beach’, lǝpuo ‘men’s house’,
lakkuan ‘village’ and lauburien/laurien ‘shade’. Although the initial [l] in these
words is stable (in my experience) it seems likely that they are historically
formed by na attaching to the beginning of a stem.5
In summary, the /n/ vs. /l/ distinction is fully contrastive in medial positions,
allowing us to set up separate phonemes, whose presence in phonologically medial position in verb class II indicates some antiquity in the language. The distinction is rather more fluid at boundaries, although a syllable-final instance is
always realised as [n].
This raises the question of how to represent fluid or potentially fluid segments.
It is assumed that there is a phonemic distinction but that there are some fluctuations in some morphemes for some speakers. For initial positions, most instances are stable and are represented by ‘n’ or ‘l’ as recorded for the particular
morpheme. Note also that intra-speaker variation is rather limited, so that the
system of each speaker appears to have either /n/ or /l/ in initial position for almost all morphemes. In other words, the variability in this position is smaller on
the level of individual speakers than for the speech community as a whole.
Variable segments are written reflecting the variation, so that for instance nǝmo/
lǝmo and laurup/naurup are written as pronounced by the speaker from whom
the example is taken. In the description of morphemes, one form is taken as basic for the sake of simplicity, and alternative pronunciations are indicated.
As regards [n]/[l] in final position, there is a neutralisation of the contrast, and
perhaps the best representation would be as an archiphoneme /L/. However, for
the purposes of this thesis, the same principle as for initial position is followed,
writing ‘n’ or ‘l’. Mostly it is ‘n’, but there are some effects for non-singular
forms of nouns. Where the non-singular ending is segmentable, the stem will be
written with final ‘n’ regardless of pronunciation (tinin-iap ‘dance group-nsg’
[tiniliap]). In non-segmentable forms, such as those given in (32) above, the
non-singular will be written with ‘l’ if that is how it was recorded.","[117, 118]"

marking in the same way. Clauses are conjoined with ga ‘and’, pa ‘but’, lǝ ‘relator (RELR)’, o ‘or’. Temporal adverbial clauses can be coded by the relator lǝ
or the word tǝrǝ ‘time’. Purpose clauses are indicated by the preposition me ‘to,
for’. Prepositions generally require nominal complements (as do possessives),
and would normally have to be followed by nominalisations, but the nominal
restriction can be circumvented with me by using the future marker e(ba),
which allows for the use of a full clause following me:

Relative clauses follow their heads, and are marked with the relator lǝ. Here the
relative clause modifies the possessor (lǝmot ‘python’) in the complex object
noun phrase:

RELR 3mS-put-3fO
‘she found this egg of this python (who) had put (=laid) it.’The relative clause is very similar to two other constructions: topicalisation and
the attribute construction. It differs from topicalisation only in that there is another clause which is interpreted as the main clause, while the relative clause is
understood to modify a nominal constituent.9 The only structural difference between a relative clause and a clause in the attribute construction is that the relator takes person prefixes in the latter function (cf. 1.1.1 above). Semantically,
attributes tend to express properties perceived of as somehow integral to the
referent, while relative clauses tend to be more general in this regard.
Nominals in many types of roles can be relativised: subjects (transitive or intransitive), objects, possessors and obliques marked with possessive markers,
and noun phrases out of prepositional phrases.
1.1.8.2 Questions
Kuot has question words for ‘who’ (aka, noun (m)), ‘what’ (mani, noun (m)),
‘do what’ (-amani, verb (class II)), ‘whose’ (auaŋ etc., possessive), ‘where’ (la9 There are probably intonational clues to the function as relative clause, but these re-main to be investigated.","[33, 34]"
"80KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: LANGUAGE HEALTHthat will occur in all languages, especially given the big changes to life style
that have occurred over the last century. For example, the village has moved
from the mountains to the coast, gardens are prepared using bush knives rather
than stone axes and shell knives, and the main crop is sweet potato rather than
taro. It is not surprising that younger people would not know specialised terminology for preparing a taro garden in the old way, etc. However, everyone in
this region is also fully fluent in Tok Pisin, and this intermediary generation
does mix a lot of Tok Pisin lexemes into their Kuot (and probably even more
when the visiting linguist is not listening).
In the next age group down, among people of around 18 or 20 years of age, we
find a reduced form of the language. These people understand Kuot without
trouble, but do not speak it often themselves; when they do, it is usually primarily in order not to be understood by speakers of Austronesian languages. I was
not able to study this variety in detail, but, there is a tendency to regularise
forms and to use the productive verb class (class I) over other verb classes and
adjectives. Occasionally other stems are regularised into class I; for instance the
adjective marakkes- ‘stinging, smarting’ is used as a class I verb. There is also
reduction of the lexicon on the pattern of Tok Pisin. As is typical of pidgins and
creoles, Tok Pisin does not have a very large lexicon, and often several senses
achieved by different lexemes in old languages are subsumed under one lexeme
in the creole. Semi-speakers transfer this simpler lexical structure to Kuot. For
example, I was told that people of this age typically use one and the same lexeme, class I isin, for both ‘search for’ and ‘find’, following Tok Pisin ‘painim’,
whereas Kuot generally has isin for ‘search’ and class II -op for ‘find’.
Children, finally, are in general not learning Kuot. They often have a good passive knowledge and can follow the main content of other people’s conversations, but even in families with two perfectly fluent parents in the 30-year age
group, the parents will speak Tok Pisin with the children. As far as I was able to
make out, this does not reflect any political stance, or idea that Tok Pisin is the
language of the nation or the future or suchlike.
It is interesting to compare this situation with Don Kulick’s (1992) study of language shift in Gapun village in the Sepik province of Papua New Guinea. He
describes cultural conceptions where the vernacular (Taiap) is associated with
the idea of ‘hed’, which is in turn associated with backwardness, lack of education, paganism and irresponsible or selfish behaviour. Tok Pisin on the other
hand is connected with ‘save’, which is associated with modernity, education,
Christianity and responsible and community-oriented behaviour. This only
partly resonates with what I observed among the Kuots. First, although a dichotomy similar to ‘hed’ versus ‘save’ is present in some respects (and there are
similarities such as women being culturally construed as irresponsible and men
as responsible) behaviour is not discussed in those terms. Second, there is presently no association of Tok Pisin with progress, and only a very weak, if any,
association of Kuot with backwardness. One old man of about 60 years asked
me if Tok Pisin was spoken in the world generally and seemed to hope and perhaps believe that that was the case. His children grew up speaking Kuot. His81TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTdaughter was taught in English in school and knows that Tok Pisin is confined
to Papua New Guinea. Yet, her children are growing up speaking Tok Pisin.
Sometimes the argument is put forward that Kuot is too difficult for the children
(this echoes the generally held opinion in the region that Kuot is a very difficult
language; which is presumably because it has gender, cross-references objects
as well as subjects, and has quite extensive agreement morphology, making it
difficult for Austronesian speakers to acquire).
Some children do grow up with Kuot as their first language, for instance in the
small village Okoiok not far from Bimun. As soon as the children are big
enough to come and play in Bimun, around five or six years of age, they acquire
Tok Pisin, and later they go to the local school which has children from both
Madak and Kuot villages, and by then Tok Pisin is established as perhaps their
strongest language, and definitely the one used in most interactions outside the
family. (In the particular case of Okoiok, children are encouraged to keep
speaking Kuot by a man who is in favour of the language surviving, and who, I
am told, will chase the children with the cane if he hears them speaking Tok
Pisin. That such measures are seen as necessary also says something about the
chances this language has of surviving.)
In Bimun, my main informant Robert Sipa started making his two sons speak
Kuot after working with me for a while. They were around three and five years
old, and could speak it after about a year. They speak it with their parents, but
of course Tok Pisin is the language used amongst the children in general.
Unfortunately, efforts towards language preservation are the exception rather
than the rule (although one would wish they did not involve the cane). One
main reason is the lack of identifying, or emblematic, function of the language;
the village and clan being the more important units. Most people are simply not
concerned about the language; others sometimes express concern but no very
viable initiatives have so far emerged. Further, the loss of many traditional
contexts of language use surely plays a role; for example there are no feasts
where oratory skills can be demonstrated; without the men’s houses there is
rarely story telling; and the old songs are not often sung.
Another qualification to the rough picture concerns a gender-based difference,
where it seems that women/girls in the two younger groups are often better at
the language than the men/boys. For some reason it seems that mothers speak
Kuot to their daughters more often than to their sons, and that fathers do not
speak Kuot to their sons or daughters to any noticeable degree. However, mothers tend to speak Kuot to their young daughters primarily when scolding them,
which presumably does not help to give the language positive connotations for
the girl in question.
One positive factor that has come onto the scene in the last few years is the local language preschool, part of a nation-wide programme to give the first two
years of schooling in the local language. Children are meant to learn to read and
write in the vernacular, and then have a bridging year to English as the language
of instruction. The Kuot preschool in Bimun has been in place for a couple of
82KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: ORTHOGRAPHYyears, the teachers being local women who have had a few weeks of training.
The fact that the school is there may have some positive impact on the status of
the language. (However, the orthography is problematic, and the mix of children having Kuot as the first language through to children not knowing it at all
makes it a challenging teaching situation; further, many children do not attend
regularly.)
2.12
Orthography
Most Kuot speakers are literate in the sense of knowing the alphabet and being
able to read and write a little bit, but a newspaper is tough going. Younger people can often read Tok Pisin and English reasonably well, but it is not a writing
culture. Information that you are told by another person is trusted over written
information. Even personal names are often inconsistently spelt.
There is no very consistent orthography widely in use for Kuot. There are a few
publications in Kuot, produced by the bible translators Chul-Hwa and Kyung-Ja
Chung of the Summer Institute for Linguistics together with committees formed
among Kuot speakers. The publications are the afore-mentioned hymnbook, and
two gospels and other portions of the New Testament (Marko ga 1, 2 Timoti
1994) (Bais ula mumuru ang Ioanes, ga 1, 2, 3 Babam ang Ioanes 1996), as
well as some literacy materials. The launch of a full bible translation is imminent at the time of writing.
The Chungs’ orthography writes the central vowel /ǝ/ as ‘a’ (collapsing it with
the phoneme /a/), and is somewhat inconsistent in the spelling of lenited voiceless stops, in particular as regards the variant [V] of /k/, which is written ‘g’;
while /g/ in my analysis is a separate phoneme.
Most speakers have learnt to write through the medium of English, and will use
‘v’ and ‘r’ for the lenited versions of /p/ and /t/ in most positions; sometimes ‘p’
and ‘t’ will be used word-initially even if the word follows after another word
ending in a vowel. [V] on the other hand does not have a symbol in English
(barring ‘g’ which is used for a different sound in the language), and people use
‘k’ to write it. There is no question that people are aware of the phonological
relationship between the stops and their lenited variants, but people are used to
‘v’ and ‘r’ and are not happy with the idea of using ‘p’ and ‘t’ in positions
where these sounds are lenited. Designing a practical orthography that takes
into account both the speakers’ preferences and linguistic generalisations is not
an easy task, and is not one of the aims of the present project.
Another area of inconsistency in native writing is that of affixes and clitics,
where the former are only very rarely separated from their hosts in writing,
whereas clitics may appear attached or unattached and are often inconsistent
even within one text.","[102, 103, 104, 105]"
"144WORD CLASSES AND OVERVIEW OF MORPHOLOGY: WORDfuture, and also a procedural past habitual, and has some irrealis-like functions.
Finally, tǝle (future form tǝla) is the general negation.
17. The prohibitive (i.e. negative imperative) marker is the particle buat (homonymous with the habitual auxiliary particle mentioned in 16.). It is presented
on a line of its own because it can make up an utterance (‘Don’t!’), although it
is usually part of a predicate.
18. Last in Table 2 we have the continuous aspect particle mǝn. It has relatively
free distribution in the predicate, and can even occur several times in different
positions in the same predicate, or occasionally make up a predicate on its own.
As mentioned, it is not counted when the first constituent is determined for the
placement of a clitic.
1, 12, and 18, being on the boundaries between affix, clitic and particle, are interesting. The first is no longer a productive suffix, but shares features with the
non-singular suffix which is productive. The subject enclitics of verb class I are
affix-like in terms of selectivity, but clitic-like in terms of cohesion. The continuous particle mǝn is an invariant grammatical morpheme like the other particles, but its position is less strictly determined by syntax, and it has the potential
of being used as a predicate.
4.2.3
Paradigms without stems: possessives
One group of morphemes that has not been discussed in the above sections is
the alienable (PossII) and inalienable (PossI) possessive paradigms. Each has
forms indexing twelve pronominal categories of possessor, and the alienable set
further index three to four categories of possessee (third person only; not all
forms distinguish masculine and feminine). The reason why they have not been
included is that they are only partly segmentable. For the inalienable set, each
form can be said to be a portmanteau consisting of pronominal.category+
possessive. There is thus no stem to segment out. In the alienable forms, the
first part of each form indexes the possessor, and the second part the possessee,
but again, there is no stem that remains constant in all the forms and which
could be glossed ‘possessive’. There is also a small set of interrogative possessives, which do have a base (or stem) au- to which the endings indicating 3m,
3f, 3d and 3p are added.4
4.3
Word
Criteria for a unit word can be phonological or grammatical.5 In Kuot,
phonological criteria are not helpful for defining a unit word. Stress is lexical
and not determined with reference to units such as syllables or moras in relation
to word boundaries, and phonological rules make reference to syllables but not
to words (and morpho-phonological rules apply only to certain morphology).
4 Other question words fit quite well into other word classes (noun, adjective, adverb,verb), and have not been included in this presentation.
5 These sometimes yield different results, as in Boumaa Fijian (Dixon 1988).","[166, 167]"
"44KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: KINSHIPone marrying into the community from far away (for instance a Sepik woman
married in Bimun was taken up into a Bimun clan) and involves the exchange
of shell money.
Adoption is quite common also in the sense that a relative might take over a
child, often just because they like that child, if the child and the parents agree.
There is no formal ceremony marking long-term or permanent change of primary caretaker, and the birth parents remain recognized as such. Interestingly,
there is a verb -paraŋe, which means either giving birth or taking care of a child
in the long term. It is also common for a child to go and live with relatives for a
short while, but this is perceived as different and is not covered by -paraŋe.
2.6.2
Kinship terminology
The kin terminology is also structured differently from what we are used to. In a
European system, the term applied to a person is typically determined by that
person’s gender, and it is typically unidirectional, so that your uncle does not
call you ‘uncle’. Although a few kin terms in Kuot do have those properties, the
majority are reciprocal, and many are not gendered. If we imagine a tree diagram of the kinship structure, we may say that the Kuot terms typically apply to
the connecting lines, rather than to nodes. A single term applies to the relation
as such, e.g. tata ‘maternal uncle – sister’s child’. A further difference comes
from the unilaterality of kinship reckoning, so that for instance a maternal aunt
and a paternal aunt are called by different terms and have very different roles.
See also the kinship diagrams in Appendix IV.
Table 1 lists kin terms which are not reciprocal. I am not aware of any nonreciprocal terms for relations acquired through marriage.

address: makapienalso (own) sister’s daughter’s husband; “tata-in-law”The terms kakka ‘mum’ and mama (etc.) ‘dad’ (but not naga ‘mother’ and ira
‘father’) have a degree of reciprocity in that parents sometimes use them to their
children. This happens when cuddling the child or speaking nicely to it. It is
also used to children through extension of terms, e.g. children of same-sex siblings. It is not considered acceptable to order these around with full parental
authority, so a request for the child to go and get something would be spoken46KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: KINSHIPquite softly (e.g. ‘kakka, go and ask tata John for a betel nut for me and bring it
here’). You do not get the reciprocal use in scolding (‘how many times have I
told you to go get water!?’). A child never uses poi ‘child’ to a parent.28
A point to be drawn from the reciprocal use of kakka is that the presence of a
reciprocal kin term does not mean that there is a reciprocal kin relation: there is
no question of a child having authority over a parent. Some other relations
which are asymmetrical in spite of full reciprocity of terms are mentioned in
2.6.4 below.
Both in male and female terms for parents-in-law, there is a collapse with consanguineal terms. For the male, this is kokole ‘mother-in-law/female crosscousin’, and for the female it is aia ‘parent-in-law/grand-relation’. The explanation would seem to be that traditionally, the preferred marriage for a male was
with the daughter of his cross-cousin. His cross-cousin would then be his
mother-in-law, and his parents would be of his wife’s grandparents’ generation.
This principle was never actually stated to me in spite of efforts to establish
principles of betrothal and marriage, but Chung (n.d.) mentions it, and Powdermaker (1971 [1933]: 147) does the same for the Nochi. (Cf. also remarks on
marriage in 2.7.12.7 below.)
It should also be noted that the terms used for many relationships mediated by
marriage depend on what relation existed between the two parties before the
marriage, in particular perhaps within ego’s own moiety. In these situations
speakers sometimes have a choice of terms, and different speakers choose
differently, with a tendency to follow the marriage-based terms for close kin of
the spouse, and the pre-marriage terms in other cases.
Some terms are best defined via other terms. For example, leinasoŋ is the wife
of tata, and this specification does not take into account whether the tata in
question is nephew or uncle to ego.
Many of the reciprocal terms have special dual and plural forms used for third
person reference. The special duals and plurals contrast with regular duals and
plurals (non-singulars), in that the special forms refer to pairs or groups of individuals connected to each other by the kin term, while the regular forms refer to
pairs or groups connected to an anchor29 who is not part of the group referred to.
See 5.4.1 for the terms and forms.
The principles of the Kuot kin system become very much clearer when attention
is paid to the moiety of each of the persons; the moieties are represented in different types of lines in Appendix IV. However, several terms are not limited to
the same or to the opposite moiety from that of ego. This is not so surprising in
the case of ‘grand-relation’; it seems to denote a relation two or more genera28 This asymmetry appears to be quite common in languages where parents can use‘mommy’ or ‘daddy’ to a child, see e.g. Rieschild (1998).
29 See Dahl & Koptjevskaja-Tamm (2001) on using “anchor” rather than “ego” whenthe speaker and ego are not the same.","[66, 67, 68, 69]"

-bun, and the addition of -p or -(u)lǝp. In other cases, the non-singular suffix is
simply added to the singular form (sometimes causing the [n]/[l] variation; see
3.2.2.4, and 5.2.11 below). In the case of kuraibun, murǝlaibun and udebun
(which also has the form utebun), the shorter non-singular form is the form used
for the masculine equivalents (kuraima, murale and uduma). The last two nonsingulars, alip and lalabip, are simply irregular, but lalabip together with donabip and ubulubip belong with the non-singulars ending in -bip (5.3 below).
As for the dual forms, makabie and kubebie belong to a pattern that occurs with
some words for female humans (see 5.4). The duals of kuraibun and one of the
possibilities for suaebun illustrate a common type of irregular dual in Kuot: instead of being formed on the non-singular form of the noun in question, they are
formed on a non-singular pattern used with other words in the same group. Thus
the non-singular base of kurailǝpien would be *kurailǝp, and of suaebulupien
*suaebulup. Although the forms are unattested for these particular words, it is
clear that they represent ways of forming non-singular which are attested for
other nouns of a similar form.
As mentioned, bun words frequently refer to female entities. They further often
contrast with words for male entities, having the same or a similar initial part of
the stem. I am aware of the following pairs:

"25TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTAnother factor is to do with the structure of Kuot itself, where agreement and
cross-referencing make the production of a sentence into a jigsaw puzzle. It
takes time to learn to do it fast. My own unfortunate personality trait of not liking to make mistakes meant that I did not venture to speak much in the first trip,
and I never achieved full speed in utterances of more than a few words. But my
interactions were increasingly in Kuot, and people found it entertaining to come
and talk with me, which was always useful practice.
1.5
Fieldwork situation
I had decided that it would be socially difficult to check out several villages and
have to reject all but one, and had selected Bimun after reading an unpublished
report by the Summer Institute of Linguistics Bible translator Chul-Hwa Chung
to the effect that the language was strongest in villages belonging to the protestant United Church (rather than the Roman Catholic Church), and stronger on
the west coast than on the east coast. This still left a choice, so I studied the map
and found that Bimun had several streams nearby and so I opted for Bimun.
It may have been useful to have chosen a village further from the boundary of
another language area, but at the time I was not sure of the exact location of the
boundary. I also found out later that Bimun village resettled from the mountains
around 1930, which surely caused disruption to life in general and perhaps in
some ways also to language use.
Much later it came to my attention that people in Panaras, in the northern Kuotspeaking area, were a little disgruntled that so much linguistic attention was
being given to the southern area, with the Chungs (SIL bible translators) in
Kabil on the east coast and me in Bimun on the west coast, as the people of
Panaras consider their dialect the more original one. They will tell you that their
village has been there for so long that there was never a time when it was not
there (although they say it was called Naunabun; however Panaras is the name
used by explorers at the beginning of the 20th century). Given the fact that all
clans are said to originate from Kun in the northern area, there may be something to their claim that theirs is a very old Kuot location, and it may or may not
be the case that the dialect is more archaic; the dialectal differences are at any
rate fairly small (see 2.6; 2.10). None of this was known to me when making
my choice of fieldwork location, and I might have chosen differently had I
known. But I have had no reason to regret my choice and apart from the considerations just given everything worked out in the best way possible in Bimun.
I first arrived in New Ireland in July 1997, on a tourist visa to select a village
for fieldwork and see if I could do anything about speeding up the processing of
my application for a research visa. Officials in Kavieng were very helpful, and
(unsuccessfully) tried to locate Kuot speakers in Kavieng who could introduce
me to a village, and even provided transport to Bimun. On the way to Bimun,
we had to stop and ask where it was. The couple we asked turned out to be from
Bimun, and they became my host family: Roslyn and Abraham, and their children Haybie, Maylyn and Elisa, and later my namesake Eva. Roslyn’s father26INTRODUCTION: FIELDWORK SITUATIONJonathan Laromeng is a respected bigman in the area, which may have contributed to general approval of the arrangement.
In the first short trip, I spent two separate weeks in Bimun. It was only days before people started telling Roslyn that she had a new sister, and over time we
developed a very close relationship. In many areas of Papua New Guinea, kinship defines the types of relations a person may have to other people (cf. 2.6.4).
Through Roslyn, my relations to most other people were defined too, so that I
had parents and aunts and brothers-in-law, and so forth. The kinship incorporation did not apply to me fully as a white person and obvious outsider. Some
people appreciated my efforts to observe name taboos and other aspects of kinbased behaviour, while others seemed to find it rather silly.
Abraham soon decided I needed a house of my own, and built one while I was
back in Australia waiting for the research permit to come through. The house
was made from bush materials and had a room where I slept and where I could
lock up equipment and belongings, and an open veranda where I worked and
where people could come and visit. In an unfamiliar environment, private space
was a blessing, and also meant that I could be sure I was not in anybody’s way.
I had no cooking facilities beyond a small kerosene cooker, and had all meals
with Roslyn and family, which provided a natural way of being part of everyday
family life. It was socially impossible to pay for food and housing, but when I
went to town I would buy rice, tinned fish, sugar, onions and other items that
were in demand, and also things such as thongs and clothes for the children,
batteries, occasional items of clothing and so forth. I also brought somewhat
more expensive gifts when coming from Australia.
Similarly, I could not pay my main informant Robert Sipa in money, but bought
clothes for his children, cigarettes, fishing line and other things that he wanted
or seemed to need, as well as bigger presents from Australia.
In the village, I would spend most of the time on my veranda, looking through
notes and transcriptions of stories, trying to make sense of the language, preparing questions or working with Robert Sipa (or others who might come and
offer to help with my work). Sometimes people would just come and visit for a
while. Occasionally I would go to the gardens with Roslyn, which was interesting although I think I got in her way more than I helped. There were of
course also chores, such as washing clothes in the river (always pleasant), or
weeding and sweeping around the house. I also attended any ceremonies, and
on Sundays I went to church. A few times I visited other villages, like Panaras
and Kabil, to record stories there. I would have liked to travel the Kuot area
more, and also to visit the former site of the village in the mountains, but there
was never a suitable companion for such a trip.
I stayed in the village for about three weeks at a time, and then went to the provincial capital of Kavieng for about a week, to collect mail, do shopping, and
write reports on various areas of Kuot grammar. I kept a computer in Kavieng
(there was no electricity in Bimun) and used it to type up the field reports,
which I sent to supervisors in Australia and Sweden. Report writing helped to
27TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTmake data collection more systematic, and it was very useful to get feedback
and further queries while still in the field.

SPEAKERS
This chapter provides mainly non-linguistic information about the speakers of
Kuot, in terms of geography, history, social organisation, kinship and culture, as
well as dialects of Kuot.
2.1
Geographic location
Kuot is spoken in some ten villages on the east and west coasts of North Central
New Ireland, Papua New Guinea. When explorers first arrived in the area, there
were Kuot villages on the west coast and in the mountains, but not on the east
coast; the mountain population has since moved down to settle on the coasts.
On the east coast, Kuot villages are interspersed and sometimes mixed with
Nalik- and Nochi-speaking villages.
The main Kuot villages from north to south on the east coast (in fact north-east
coast) are:
Kama
Bol (village shared with Nalik speakers)
Fanafiliuo
Liedan
Kabiland on the west (south-west) coast:
Naiama
Panaras
Naliut
Nakalakalap
Patlangat
Bimun(Neiruaran)The villages range in size from around 80 people to some 500, with smaller
hamlets besides. Since there is quite a number of people from other linguistic
districts outside and within New Ireland living in the area, and since many children do not speak the language at all, determining how many people actuallyTOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTspeak Kuot is a difficult task. My tentative estimate is around 1,500 people who
are reasonably fluent.1
New Ireland Province extends from the equator to the 5th parallel south, and
from the 149th to the 154th longitude east. The Kuot area is just south of the
3rd parallel, and the climate is tropical, with annual rainfall figures around
3.500 mm (138 inches). There is no very pronounced division of the year into
dry and wet seasons in New Ireland.2 Temperatures on the coast range between
about 33°C (92°F) in the daytime and about 25°C (77°F) at night all year round.
The Schleinitz mountain range runs along all of central New Ireland, reaching
heights of well over 800 metres (2600 feet) in the Kuot area. The mountains are
steep on the west coast and start rising just a few tens of metres from the coast
in many places, the highest peaks being only some 4 kilometres from the coast
line (as measured on the map). The landscape then slopes gradually towards the
east coast, where there is more flat ground with mangrove swamps near the
coast.
New Ireland is a narrow island, and all major languages run across it from coast
to coast (though at present the only villages in the mountains are in the Lelet
plateau south of the Kuot area). Kuot borders in the south on Madak (more precisely the Lavatbura–Lamusong language within the Madak family), and in the
north on Nalik. On the east coast, Kuot villages are interspersed with Nalik villages in the north and Nochi (Notsi) villages along the rest of the coast. (The
Nalik territory does not reach across the island.)
2.2
Prehistory
Australia and New Guinea formed a single continent, Sahul, until about 8,000
years before present (BP). This continent appears to have been settled by about
55,000 years BP. However, New Ireland was never joined to other landmasses,
even during glacial maximum some 18,000 years BP when sea levels were
about 130 meters below their present levels. The first settlers must thus have
had some sea-faring skills: even if there is two-way visibility between New
Guinea and New Britain, the crossing has always been more than 50 km. Hu1 I have not been able to get data from the 2000 census. I am told that the census ques-tionnaire does not contain questions about language and thus can only provide population information as a basis for an estimate of the number of speakers. In the 1990 information I have access to, the census data also was not fine-grained enough in terms
of village names to give a good idea of the situation on the east coast where the territory is shared with other languages. In 1968, Lithgow & Claassen (1968: 3) give the
number of speakers as 712. Chung & Chung (1996: 1) give the number as approximately 2,000. I believe both figures are based on censuses for the area, and although
there is a general population increase, the dramatic growth indicated by these numbers
may be partly an artefact of changing census division boundaries.
2 For the first several months of my first long stay in the field, there was no rain at all,due to the occurrence in 1997 of the cyclical climatological disturbance known as el
Niño.","[46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"
"186NOUNS: GENDERvocabularies are fairly small (especially after omitting words from the special
declensions), which makes it difficult to say anything definite.
For water and liquids we have the following in the plain and n declensions:
(66)danuot

spittle (also cl.I verb ‘spit’)
sweat (also cl.I verb ‘sweat’)
sweat (also cl.I verb ‘sweat’)
under sea surface down to sea floor
very high tide

bloodHere the feminine tendency seems reasonably strong, but there is also varying
usage for several words.
It should be noted also that words that can function as verb stems in verb class I
(pipi, kasup, mabis, mage.is) are almost exclusively feminine (see discussion on
nominalisations below in this section and 5.8).
If there has been a principle of assigning words for liquids to the feminine gender, it appears not to be operating any longer, as most recent Tok Pisin loans in
this area receive masculine gender (at least for most speakers), e.g. ‘kerosin’
(kerosine), ‘spirit’ (spirits), ‘kodiel’ (cordial), ‘bia’ (bear); though some are
feminine, e.g. ‘sup’ (soup) and ‘ti’ (tea).
Sharp instruments have a small tendency to be feminine too (but note too that
some of the words for spears given in (60) were masculine):
(67)ie
dabula
amatau
lasǝk
kubǝtf
f
f
f
mknife
sharpened stone to be made into axe
axe (N. Kuot)
small axe, stone axe; heavy ‘club’
adze for splitting bambooIn this group may be included also shell knives and scrapers: bie ‘peeler,
scraper’, and kar/mimidu/mudǝmudǝnun ‘coconut scraper’, which are all feminine. However, these are also the names for the shells from which the implements are made, so again other principles may be at work. When Tok Pisin
‘naip’ is used for knife, it is feminine, and so are the loan words nil/nin and pin
(from ‘needle’ and ‘pin’).
In the category fire, we have kit ‘fire’ which is feminine; related words like
bonǝt ‘smoke’ and utǝrǝ ‘ashes’ are also feminine, but this does not necessarily
indicate a principle to do with fire. Ilak ‘lightning’ and ileŋ ‘daylight’ are also
feminine. ‘Dry coconut frond; torch’, pirit, is masculine, as are the Tok Pisin187TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTloan words ‘sikar’ and ‘simuk’ for cigarette. The words for ‘coal/ember’ and
‘burning stick of firewood’ are in the special declensions.
Substances and mass nouns used in the singular (cf. 5.5 above) are another
category that could potentially receive special treatment. Words for liquids were
given in (66) above, but there are others that may be regarded as substances:
(68)tes
buna
bonǝt
ailu
magit
utǝrǝ
pǝlakkon/kon
pekaf
f
f
f
m/f
m
m
msalt
fine black sand
smoke
grease
coconut fat
ashes
betel paste (chewed)
pusThese give no indication of a gender preference, which is perhaps not surprising, given that the count vs. mass distinction is not generally grammatically reflected in the language.
Most time words are feminine, excepting one word meaning ‘time’:
(69)la
f
parabira f
(na)bit
f
ileŋ
f
arubu
f
tǝrǝ
mday/time
morning
afternoon
daylight, daytime
darkness, night
timeTok Pisin loans such as the names of weekdays are feminine too, and other time
words are treated as feminine by most speakers: ‘aua’ (hour), ‘minit’ (minute),
‘wik’ (week). Interestingly, when the Tok Pisin word ‘taim’ (time) is used, it is
masculine like its translation equivalent tǝrǝ.
Abstract nouns have a tendency to be feminine (leaving nominalisations aside
for the moment):
(70)abake
lamet
nǝmara
uno
pǝbǝs
ka
tapukf
f
f
f
f
f
mstarvation
big hunger and weakness
beginning
customary law
big fight, war

behaviourNominalisations are generally feminine too. There are two types of nominalisations (meaning action nominals) in Kuot: morphological and non-morphological. Among morphological nominalisations, we find nominalisations from class
II and III verbs and nominalisations from adjectives. In both cases, the resulting
nouns are always feminine. This may be regarded as another type of morphological gender assignment, alongside the special declensions, since this type of
nouns is recognisable through the nominalisation morphology (cf. 1.1.2):188NOUNS: GENDER

badness, sin < kirǝ(adj)

slipperyThe picture is a little more complex when we turn to the relation between nouns
and stems of verb class I, which is non-morphological, that is, there is no morphological marking of the transfer between classes. Stems which can be used
either as nouns or in verb class I tend overwhelmingly to be feminine in their
nominal use. What this means for the question of gender semantics is difficult
to say. That is, is it the case that these nouns are feminine because they are also
verb stems; or are they feminine for independent reasons, such as the fact that
they denote liquids? In the latter case it could be that they can be recruited for
verb use as a secondary effect of being feminine. In 1.1.2, I argue that verb
class I is a relatively late development in the language, evolved from noun +
alienable possessive marker. This would suggest that gender properties, being
nominal properties, are prior to verb-forming properties, but it is also possible
to imagine a degree of realignment for noun stems used as verbs. As there is no
overt morphology marking their association with verbs, we would not want to
call this morphological gender assignment.
Inherently locative nouns are feminine too; see 5.7.1.
Another semantic category sometimes utilized in gender systems is nouns for
artefacts and/or culturally and ritually important things (e.g. Lavukaleve
where they are in the neuter gender (Terrill 1999: 126) and Ojibwa and other
Algonquian languages, reported in Corbett (1991: 20, 315). The following
examples show that this is not a consistent area in Kuot:

magic (things used)
magic (evil lime powder)14 nouns for dances and songs for various ceremonies are similarly scattered
between the genders (and at least one can be either feminine or masculine).
No tendency has been noted for items concerned with male spheres of activity
to follow masculine gender, or vice versa.
More generally, much traditional knowledge has been lost, and there may be
mythical associations embedded in the system that are no longer known by
speakers.
5.6.3.3 Loans
It has been shown in the foregoing that loanwords appear not to adhere to those
weak tendencies that can be suggested on the basis of the available data. This
implies that such principles are not accessible to speakers. A few more notes
may be made on the topic of loan words.
First, it is interesting to ask speakers why particular words are in particular genders (although the answers should be treated with some caution). I have never
heard anyone make reference to male/female-ness for inanimates, nor to properties like shape or size, or cultural importance etc. For loan words, the only principle that does get quoted is analogy with indigenous Kuot words. This is reasonable for instance with ‘taim’ (time) which is masculine like Kuot tǝrǝ, and
‘naip’ (knife) which is feminine like Kuot ie, since these are used in replacement of the indigenous words. Similarly, all words for boats (‘spidbot’, ‘bot’,
‘sip’ etc.) are feminine like Kuot obinǝm ‘canoe’.
But there are also many cases of mismatch. For example: bǝbam ‘leaf; book’ is
feminine, but ‘buk’ is masculine; kukuom ‘tree, wood; medicine’ is feminine
but ‘marasin’ (medicine) is masculine; koi ‘half hard shell of coconut, plate’ is
masculine but ‘plet’ is feminine (in Bimun); paragima ‘cut or split piece of
wood (plank, firewood, bamboo pole etc.)’ is masculine, but ‘pleng’ is feminine. (In all cases, the gender given is the one used by at least some speakers;
others may pick a different gender.)
When it comes to words for things that have come in after white contact the
analogy model is sometimes even less convincing. For example, all items of
clothing are masculine, and this is said to be on analogy with buruma ‘laplap’,
which is masculine. I have not been able to get a pre-laplap sense for buruma,
but we may note that the two other words for items used as clothing given in
(72), kapǝt ‘pandanus mat or “raincoat” (also pandanus sp.)’ and bekǝt
‘hat/cap’, are feminine.
We also saw that liquids and words to do with fire tend to be feminine; yet
‘kerosin’ (kerosine) is masculine (no analogy was presented for this word).
When speakers wish to express this sense in Kuot, burunǝm ‘water’ which is190NOUNS: GENDERfeminine is used. Similarly, the loan word ‘kar’ (car) is masculine, but when
loan words are avoided it is replaced by obinǝm ‘canoe’ (elliptic for obinǝm
meioŋ mi-lǝ toktok-im ‘the red ones’ canoe’, i.e. ‘white people’s canoe’) which
is feminine.
In the case of ‘bilum’, ‘net bag’, discussed in 5.6.2.1 above, some speakers use
masculine, giving kein ‘type of basket’ as the gender template (although other
baskets are feminine). At least one speaker using it as feminine said it sounded
feminine, which could indicate a sensitivity for the morphological assignment
rules, whereby the majority of nouns ending in /m/ are feminine, although such
rules are not generally known, even implicitly.
5.6.4
Gender markedness
No unequivocal answer can be given to the question of which gender is unmarked; the possible criteria point in different directions..
Masculine is used of referents whose gender is unknown, e.g.:
(73)aka i-sik?
who 3m-DEM
‘who is that?’
mani i-to?
what 3m-here
‘what is this?’Aka ‘who’ is normally used with masculine agreement even when there is
reason to believe it is a woman, for instance if you hear someone in the night
and the voice is female.
The following is used to inquire of the sex of a newborn baby:
(74)i-ari-a
man kulot?
3fS-carry-3mO what child/boy
‘what (sex) child did she (the mother) have?’The word pǝgǝ ‘thing’ is mostly used as masculine too:
(75)man pǝgǝ
i-tie?
what thing(m) 3m-there
‘what’s that?’A possible alternative analysis here is that the nouns are simply masculine (aka
‘who’, mani ‘what’ etc.).37
As mentioned in 5.6.3.1, masculine is used also for mixed-gender collectives.
Since gender is not distinguished in non-singular grammatical morphology, the
use of masculine for mixed groups can only be seen lexically, where the nonsingular of the masculine rather than the feminine is used for mixed groups (example (59) above).
37 I discussed this possibility with my main informant, who was not convinced. Al-though he was by then very much used to discussing grammatical gender, his unwillingness to say that aka etc. are masculine may be due to their referential possibilities.","[208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213]"
"TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTAngela Terrill has contributed massively to improving local and global qualities
of the present text. Even before she was officially appointed “language scrutinizer” during the the last few months, she had enthusiastically read everything I
wrote about Kuot for a long time, and commented on every level (typos, text
organisation, grammatical analysis, and points of comparison with Lavukaleve,
her own dissertation language). In the best of all possible worlds, every graduate student would have a friend like that.
Östen Dahl read the whole text in the last frenzied weeks, saving me from several gaffes, and bringing up lots of interesting points of discussion which I hope
to be able to develop and incorporate in the future version. Others who have
read parts of the manuscript and/or provided valuable discussion of particular
matters in Kuot grammar are Robert Eklund, Bert Remijsen, Gerrit Dimmendaal and Bob Rankin (all Phonology), Glenn Summerhayes (Kuot & its speakers; Previous sources in Introduction), Fritz Serzisko (tense and aspect matters
and many other bits and pieces; he also helped with German sources and translations). In Melbourne, Tim Curnow was always on hand to discuss any urgent
upcoming matters of analysis.
The input of all of the above has contributed enormously to making this volume
a much better piece of work than it would otherwise have been. Needless to say,
any remaining faulty analyses, flaws and inconsistencies exist in spite of their
best efforts and are entirely my own responsibility.
Pétur Helgason let me use his font (with IPA characters) and especially made
italicised versions of some characters, making the dissertation much more
pleasing to the eye.
Tom Dutton did his best to teach me Tok Pisin before I went into the field.
Moving to a new continent where you have almost no connections is supposed
to be hard, but I really enjoyed my time Australia, and in the end leaving was
incredibly much harder than ever arriving. So many people became part of my
life, and it is sad indeed to have a whole part of your life 17,000 kilometres
away. Some of the most important people are Tim Curnow & Tony Liddicoat,
Angela Terrill & Michael Dunn, Sinclair Dinnen, Luisa Miceli, Fritz Serzisko,
Anna & Andrew Margetts, Jim Grundy & Sandi Bone, John Bowden, Tonya
Stebbins, and Glenn Summerhayes. Tim in particular would have his name in
gold if I could afford the extra printing cost.
In Sweden, my sister Anne Gailit pulled a heavy load while I was away, taking
care of all manner of boring and time-consuming practicalities like income tax
forms, renewing my student ID card, emailing me bank statements and all those
things that one is only too happy to outsource but which are not so much fun to
find on one’s table. She also sent wonderful parcels of sweets and other necessities to the field, and not least, she visited me every year, twice in Australia and
twice in New Guinea. In the last week before printing this thesis, she spent several days, evenings and nights with fiddly processing of maps, making the cover
background and turning my fuzzy cover layout idea into a file the printers
would accept. Acres of gold print are certainly due.
xivPREFACEMy parents Aia Gailit-Lindström and Pär Lindström also visited, once in Australia and once in New Guinea, and I am particularly happy that they could
share my Bimun life for a few weeks. Generally, they have a lot to answer for in
my choice of career, in that they fostered inquisitiveness at an early age by resolving to always answer our questions. (But it always seemed to me that they
were somehow inexplicably un-enthralled by language). Big thanks to my father also for producing all the basic maps in this book, and for scanning and
processing the photos.
Robert Eklund also visited in Australia and twice in New Guinea, and kept
sending things to brighten my days; everything from fun articles to a full ring
binder of guitar tabulature with a CD when I took up playing the guitar.
My first visitor in the field was my aunt, Sara Lindström, who met up with me
in Kavieng the first time I went there. As my ‘anti’ she helped give me social
context to the villagers of Bimun, to whom a person without social ties is incomprehensible, and it was nice to share that first experience of Papua New
Guinea with her. After I ran out of funding, she suggested a big loan from her
pension fund – an offer too good to refuse – which kept me alive for several
months.
Ulrika Kvist Darnell has been a friend since my first week of linguistics more
than ten years ago, through countless cups of coffee, late nights of studying and
singing, and party-fixing galore.
Gunnel Källgren ( ) was a source of fun and of social cohesion in the department, of tiding-over loans to poor students and campari-sodas for all. She is
sorely missed. Her 386 laptop served me well in New Guinea (though it had to
have ice packs to cope with the heat of Kavieng).
In Papua New Guinea, Kevin Ford looked after me with friendly hospitality and
kindness in scary Port Moresby. The Chungs were always kind to me when I
saw them in New Ireland or Ukarumpa. Thanks are due to Michael Laki at the
National Research Institute in Port Moresby and Cnl. Dataona in Kavieng for
arranging assorted paperwork for my research permit in an efficient and
friendly manner. I wish I could have spent more time at the Department of Language and Literature at the University of Papua New Guinea, where Otto
Nekitel ( ) and Dicks Thomas received me so well the few times I visited.
I want to thank the sisters of the Sacred Heart in Kavieng, Srs Friederika, Catherine and Celine, for opening their home to me, renting me a spacious room in
the convent, which I used whenever I came to town during my first longer stay
in the field, and where I could leave my computer and other things when I went
to the village.
In my second long fieldtrip, I stayed with Ulrike, Steffen and Rebekka Mitz, a
family of German volunteer aid workers in Kavieng. I had my own room in
their house, and Steffen even built me a desk. No matter how much I enjoyed
life in Bimun, it was always lovely to join in a meal of spaghetti bolognese or
pizza and have a glass of wine with friends, listen to Steffen playing the guitar,
or go and visit the Villeneuves on the boat while they were there.
xvTOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTI have saved for last the people that have added most to my life in this entire
project: the people of Bimun. Suddenly, this white woman arrived in their village, apparently intending to stay for quite a while and presumably requiring
food and somewhere to sleep. She said she wanted to do something languagerelated, but since it was not translation nobody was quite sure what. In this
situation, not only did the villagers accept my presence, but everyone did all
they could to get my life to function optimally (including building Bimun’s first
pit latrine!) and make me feel at home. And I did. I will always carry with me
the beauty of life in Bimun, the acceptance, kindness, humour and care of the
people, our mutual curiosity about each other and our shared laughs.
Some people became especially important. A very close relationship developed
with Roslyn, my sister in Bimun; an undemanding, completely accepting closeness. She is the main reason why coming to Bimun will always be coming
home for me. Her husband Abraham not only built my much-loved little house
and carried the responsibility for my well-being and safety, but was also a fantastic host to my visitors, especially my parents, putting lots of effort into organising picnics and other activities for their enjoyment, with a keen sense of
what would be interesting to the foreign guests. I also want to mention their
children, Haybie, Maylyn, Elisa, and my namesake Eva, always fun and always
cute.
I owe perhaps the biggest debt of gratitude to Robert Sipa, who was my main
informant. His linguistic sensibility and his help in analysing the finer points of
grammar have contributed immesurably to my understanding of Kuot. He spent
hours and hours working with me on my veranda and our discussions meandered across many topics linguistic and non-linguistic in the course of my
months in Bimun, and made my time there even more enjoyable. Thanks must
go also to his family, Baumat, Gensen Oliver and Eskol, for not grudging me
the time he spent with me.
I also want to thank the following people for recording stories for me to analyse: Abraham Towil, Adam Mode, Anton Taipan, Avagi Philip, Benson
Tomaliu, Bernard Puskin, David Jotham, Desi Bais, Eliaser Peter, Veronica
Galeng, John Sikama, Jonathan, Kristina Dalap, Lakin, Lomlom, Lopap Uasita,

Pauline Kotete, Penga Kapelis, Penias Kotlik, Petrus Anis, Robert Sipa, Roslyn
Ngas, Sabuen Esau Lali, Sialis, and Siteon. Big thanks also to Tasen for recording lots of traditional songs. And thanks too to Selina and Monica for food
and friendship. I wish I could fit everyone’s name on these pages.

This thesis describes certain areas in the grammar of the little-known Kuot
language, spoken by some 1,500 people in New Ireland Province in Papua New
Guinea. Kuot is an isolate, and is the only non-Austronesian (Papuan) language
of that province. The analyses presented here are based on original data from 18
months of linguistic fieldwork.
The first chapter provides an overview of Kuot grammar, and gives details of
earlier mentions of the language, and of data collection and the fieldwork situation. The second chapter presents information about the prehistory and history
of the area, the social system, kinship system and culture of Kuot speakers, as
well as dialectal variation and prognosis of survival of the language. Chapter
three treats Kuot phonology, with particular emphasis on the factors that govern
allophonic variation, and on the expression of word stress and the functions of
intonation. Word classes and the criteria used to define them are presented in
Chapter four, which also contains a discussion of types of morphemes in Kuot.
The last chapter describes in some detail the class of nouns in Kuot, their
declensions, non-singular formation, and the properties of grammatical gender.
Appendices give the full set of person-marking forms in Kuot, a transcription of
a recorded text with interlinear glossing and translation, the Swadesh 100-word
list for Kuot, and diagrams of kin relations and terminology.iiiCONTENTS

"191TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTIn contrast, feminine is used when there is no referent to agree with (i.e. no
controller; zero agreement). In Kuot, each verb and adjective has an obligatory
subject position, which has to be filled even when there is no referent. This is
the case for instance in the expression used for ‘thank you’ – as in most languages in this part of the world there was traditionally no expression translating
directly into ‘thank you’, but when the custom of using it was introduced, the
expression ‘it is good’ was recruited for the purpose. There is no real-world correspondent of ‘it’, and feminine gender is used:
(76)tema=ieŋ
be.good=3fS
‘it’s good’; ‘thank you’Similarly, the “situation in general” is cross-referenced with the feminine, as in
i-la in the next example. There is also a verb meaning, among other things, ‘to
reach’ or ‘to last until’. In this sense, it always takes feminine cross-referencing.
The following excerpt is from a story where a pregnant woman dies in the bush,
but her baby survives and feeds himself off his mother’s body and later roams
and eats from gardens in the bush. The preceding sentence translates ‘Again he
came, again he came next to his mother, again he suckled of her rot.’, and the
story continues:
(77)I-la
puo=ieŋ lǝ
[u-la
kak-kan-i],
3fS-go until=3fS RELR 3mS-go RED-big-3m
kak-kan-i=rǝ
ga u-num...
RED-big-3m=ASP and 3mS-walk
‘It went (on like this) until he went big, he was big and he walked…’There is no question of agreement with a concrete referent for the two feminine
cross-reference markers here. (The construction with puo is a type of complementation construction.)
The feminine is used also for discourse anaphors, for instance referring back to
the contents of an entire narrative (discourse deixis). In this case it is a speaker
who treats gas ‘story’ as masculine, which shows that the feminine agreement
in u-tie does not agree with ‘story’ but has precisely the function of referring
back to the preceding context:
(78)U-tie=t

tu-arǝmǝ-a.
3f-there=just 3m- -- story(m) 3m-DEM story(m) RELR 1sS-tell-3mO
Tema=ieŋ.
be.good=3fS
‘that’s it (of) <thi- story> this story I am telling. Thank you’This usage tallies with the prevalence of feminine gender for abstracts (5.6.3.2
above).
Often, agreement with an actual referent is preferred. This is the case with the
class IIb verb -it ‘know’, which tends to cross-reference the referent about
which something is or is not known, rather than the entire proposition of
knowing or not knowing, for example in the following where the object agree-192NOUNS: GENDERment is with the pigs rather than the idea of an unknown number of pigs (but

3pO-1sS-knowLooking at the distribution of nouns, the fact that such tendencies for semantic
assignment principles as can be found assign nouns to feminine classes (e.g.
categories like ‘water’ and ‘abstracts’) suggests that feminine is (or was) the
marked gender. Masculine would have been the default gender for everything
except male beings.
However, when we look at the gender distribution of words in the plain declension (Table 1 above) we can see that when there is no morphological assignment, feminine words are in the majority, although the difference is not dramatic (58% to 42% for masculine among words with known gender). Such a
distribution is more consistent with a situation where masculine is the positively
defined gender, and feminine a default gender. It is of course possible that there
were semantic categories associated with each of the genders in the past, but
that the categories defined as masculine have become even more obscured than
those defined as feminine.
5.6.5
Decline of the gender system
Kuot speakers are very much aware of their language having gender. This is because it is not present in the surrounding languages, which are all Austronesian.
However, their awareness does not extend to the distribution of referents across
the two genders. Interestingly, neither semantic nor morphological assignment
principles are accessible to most speakers. This is evident in that no speaker is
willing to guess the gender of a word that they do not know, even if it is in the
largest and most regular of the special declensions (i.e., the ma declension).
It seems reasonable to assume that there once were semantic principles for the
assignment of inanimate nouns to masculine or feminine gender, but it is clear
that these are no longer part of the competence of speakers. The inconsistencies
found with loan words are one further indication. I was also told that children
do not use gender correctly until quite late – about age seven according to my
informant (since most children in Bimun are not learning Kuot, I was not able
to make any observations on this point).38 Further, there is no creative use of
gender: in many languages, gender can be manipulated for expressive purposes
(e.g. using feminine gender for ‘man’ in Manambu conveys femininity (Aikhenvald in press), and in Lavukaleve, feminine can be used to convey smallness of
referents, although smallness is not a property of feminine nouns in general
(Terrill 1999: 129–130)); in Kuot no such usage has been observed, and none
could be elicited.","[213, 214, 215]"
"99TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTHowever, /ǝ/ is also a common allophone of /a/, and sometimes of /e/ and /o/,
particularly in unstressed syllables. It has therefore often been difficult to establish whether a phone [ǝ] represents the phoneme /a/, or the phoneme /ǝ/, and
this is an area where some inconsistencies remain in the analysis of Kuot phonology, as it has not been possible to check every single lexical item. Further,
/ǝ/ has a low level of salience to many of the speakers (possibly in part because
it has no separate written representation, instead being written with ‘a’), which
makes it difficult to investigate. In other cases /ǝ/ vs. /a/ is a matter of analysis.
Although /ǝ/ may be stressed it is never long, for instance in:
(39)sǝ'gǝr
egg
'tǝrǝnǝm opening in fence, stileI have no examples of it in V or VC syllables.
/a/ is frequently realised as /ǝ/ in unstressed syllables. Many words also have
variable pronunciation, where either /a/ or /ǝ/ is acceptable, e.g. in:
(40)ga ~ gǝ
and
ulaŋ ~ ulǝŋ moon/a/ is the vowel that shows the clearest phonetic lengthening in stressed syllables, particularly in a non-final stressed syllable, mostly before /r/ but also before other continuants, for example in words like these:
(41)'barǝnim reef at low tide; year
'lasup
stick for husking coconutsThat stress alone is not enough to cause lengthening is clear from the fact that
/a/ in following words is not long, and is also a little more open in quality than
in the words in (41):
(42)ku'dat
ki'lanwooden fence
arm/e/ is realised as [e] ~ [ɛ]. There appears to be free variation between these, but
with a tendency for [e] to appear in a final open syllable, and perhaps a tendency for [ɛ] in a non-final syllable, for instance:
(43)sige
epǝ
maset[sɪ'ge:]
spoon
['ɛ:vǝ]
mumu (northern dialect)
[mǝ'sɛt] ~ [mǝ'set] well (adv.)/e/ almost never occurs in an unstressed syllable. Only in a very few words does
there appear to be an unstressed /e/, for example:
(44)lekke
udebun
espan['lekɛ]
front (adv.)
[ude'bʊn] banana plant (generic for species of feminine gender)
[ɛs'pan]
sunSome nouns have inherent reduplication (i.e., appear to be the result of reduplication although it is not productive for the word in question). It is interesting to
note that the syllable that bears the stress has /e/, while the other syllable does
not:100PHONOLOGY: VOWELS
(45)bǝŋ'beŋ heel
kǝ'kkep kneecap, money, breast ornament
dǝ'dema word, behaviourHistorically, it may be the case that /ǝ/ was in an allophonic relation not only
with /a/ but also with /e/ and possibly /o/, but note that there is, at least synchronically, a phonemic opposition, as in mǝla ‘crowd’ vs. mela ‘in-law’. (Native speakers’ spelling of e.g. dǝdema as ‘dadema’ may be taken as support for
the suggestion that /e/ is phonemically ruled out in this position, and not simply
pronounced at less than cardinal value.)
/i/ is pronounced [ɪ] or [i]. The variation is largely free, and depends on factors
such as speed of speech, although there is some correlation with stress, e.g.:
(46)ka'dibambookadI'bIp bamboo plantsWhen adjacent to another vowel, /i/ normally functions as a glide (see also 3.3.2
below), e.g.:
(47)i-onǝma ['jɔnǝma] 3fS-sit/live/stay – she sits (/lives/stays; sat/lived/stayed)

life
bird (sp.)
ant (sp.)A contrast possibly analysable as length has been found in a very few monosyllables with /u/; see 3.3.1 below.
When adjacent to another vowel, /u/, like /i/, is usually realised as a glide (see
also 3.3.2 below), e.g.:
(49)u-abǝ ['wabǝ]
uuau [u'waʊ]3mS-climb – he climbs/climbed (verb cl II)
cloud/o/ is realised as [o] ~ [ɔ]. It is uncommon in unstressed syllables but not as rare
as the other mid vowel, /e/. Like /a/, it is phonetically lengthened in a non-final
stressed syllable before /r/ and in a stressed final open syllable, e.g. in:
(50)'korǝŋ
fǝ'loend
bamboo section/joint, cupExamples of /o/ in unstressed syllables include:
(51)o'binǝm canoe
niro'bu coconut palm
'kobon idiot, crazy person
'kabo
seedAccording to my informant (Robert Sipa), /o/ is increasing in the pronunciation
of younger speakers, with many forms that used to be pronounced with /ǝ/ now
occurring with /o/, e.g. pukǝma [puɣǝma] ~ [puɣɔma] ‘hill, mountain’.
101TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOT3.3.1
Length?
Only two minimal pairs have been found in the language whose contrast could
perhaps be described as length, and only in one vowel. But instrumental analysis gives only weak support for this interpretation, and another possibility
would be to say that the difference lies in one member of each pair having inherent stress (cf. 3.5 below). It has not been possible to explore all conceivable
analyses for this distinction here.
All four lexemes concerned are from verb class I. In extremely clear pronunciation, they may be transcribed as follows:
(52)duk
duk[du:k}]
[dʊk}]thunder
break (of rope)ut
ut[u:t}]
[ʊt}]be like (constr. with prep. bo ‘on’)
be full (from food)However, the length and quality differentiation is not strongly supported, and
the forms will be differentiated only through their meanings in the following.
The contrast has a very low functional load, occurring only in these pairs, and is
also not perceptually very salient. In fact, the pairs were only discovered on inquiring about the apparent homonymy, but the difference was borne out by different speakers at different times and was consistent. Attempts to elicit more
pairs were fruitless, as were attempts to find other minimal pairs in the data
contrasting on this parameter, with /u/ or with other vowels.
The pair for duk was recorded with two different speakers in controlled syntactic contexts to investigate the nature of the difference. This was done as part of
a recording session investigating stress, and in order to avoid exaggerated differentiation by the speakers the two sentences were not adjacent in the recording. The result for each with the third person singular feminine subject enclitic (referring to iakur ‘rope’ which is feminine for the sense ‘break’, and
functioning as the Ø subject marker for ‘thunder’, i.e. ‘it is thundering’) is given

"All of these (except perhaps kabirǝna) are very common, and I have never heard
arubu used with the preposition; nor have I heard ileŋ or bit without it, as greetings.
(This type of greeting is almost certainly inspired by contact with white people. Another type exists alongside it, namely the questions ‘where are you going?’ and ‘where
are you coming from?’. These were reported early in this area, and are likely to be
much older in origin.)196NOUNS: SUB-CLASSES OF NOUNSPossI. This is a consequence of their semantics rather than a lexical restriction:
while there can be a leg without a pig attached, there cannot be a ‘behind’ that
is not behind something. There is no possibility of using the relational nouns to
denote parts (such as ‘back’ or ‘front’); they are only ever relational, and never
referential.
Table 5 is a list of relational nouns in Kuot.

behindThe relational nouns differ in the degree to which non-singular and dual forms
are acceptable to different speakers, and the degree to which such forms are
used. The issue of gender in these words is also difficult. For almost all nonsingular forms and genders given here, some speakers have at some time said
that they do not exist.
Thus kabirǝna and arabura were at first given the genders now in parentheses,
while other speakers later said that they do not have gender (I have no examples
from texts where any other constituent agrees with any of these words). Kabirǝna and arabura are normally used in the singular, regardless of the number of
referents of the second noun phrase, as in (86). But I was given an example of
arabura in the plural, with a singular “possessor”:
(87)araburǝ-p o
ileŋ
middle-nsg 3f.PossI daytime(f)
‘(in) the middles of the day’araburǝ-p o
arubu
middle-nsg 3f.PossI night(f)
‘(in) the middles of the night’The reference would be to repeated instances of (approximate) middays and
midnights.
Mǝlonim ‘behind’, on the other hand, itself takes dual or non-singular form depending on the number of the possessor, according to my informants (only examples with possessors in the singular occur naturally in my data, so these are
examples given me when discussing these words with speakers):
(88)mǝlonim tuo
behind
1s.PossI
‘behind me’mǝlonim-up-ien lie
behind-nsg-dl
3d.PossI
‘behind them (2)’mǝlonim-up ma
behind-nsg 3p.PossI
‘behind them’In the third person, it is of course also possible to have a possessor noun, e.g.
mǝlonim-up ma makaulǝp ‘behind the women’. Mǝlonim is used also of non-197TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOToriented items, for instance expressing that something can be behind a stone or
tree, which do not have inherent fronts or backs.42
Sometimes there is no possessive marking, if the object or person to which the
location is being related can be understood from context. In this example, reference is made to a woman who is uphill from the place of speaking but on her
way down, after the speaker, who is also on her way down, and speaking to yet
a third woman. The elided possessive phrase would refer to the speaker:
(89)Eba no-du=ieŋ
u-timaidǝŋ
mǝlonim
FUT 2sO-push=3fS
3f-downwards behind
‘The one coming down behind will give you a push’In terms of number inflection, lekke (/leikke) ‘before’ is at least partly similar to
mǝlonim: it takes the dual form when the possessor is dual (but was initially
said to have no non-singular form). These constructions are unique within Kuot:
nowhere else does the number of the possessor govern the form of the possessed (in this case those relational nouns that have this construction).43
Uadan/uadanim ‘between’ is a little different for different speakers. Some will
allow for it to be used only of a situation where something is found in between
two other referents (e.g. ‘between the (2) houses’). For other speakers, predominantly speakers of northern Kuot, it can be used synonymously with kabirǝna
and arabura for ‘middle, midst’.
Arakkin ‘opposite’ is used for alignment in either the horizontal or the vertical
dimension; above or across. In one narrative, the first coconut palm grew
straight over the grave of a man, and arakkin was used. It can also be used for
‘opposite’ or ‘straight across’, as in ‘the hotel is directly opposite the bank’.
5.7.3
pǝsǝnǝ‘clansman, clanswoman’, bonim ‘name’
I am aware of two exceptions to the statement that the choice between PossI and
PossII possessive marking is semantic rather than lexical (cf. 1.1.3): bonim
‘name’ (which is treated as a body part in many languages), and pǝsǝnǝ ‘clansman, clanswoman’, which are both used with PossI44 – this is particularly surprising for pǝsǝnǝ since all other kin terms take PossII possessive marking.45 An
42 The Kuot use of ‘behind’ is thus similar to that of English in this respect, but unlikethat of Longgu (Austronesian, Solomon Islands) in which directional terms like
‘inland’ and ‘seaward side’ are used to relate locations to objects without back/front
orientation, unless they are in motion (Hill 1997: 122).
43 Both lekke and mǝlonim also have some temporal uses, which will not be exploredhere.
44 There is some variation among words for pimples, sores, substances emanating fromthe body and the like, which may be partly lexical as well.
45 Interestingly, Volker reports from Nalik that alienable possessive marking is replac-ing inalienable marking, including kin terms, and the only kin term that is presently
only ever used with the inalienable marking is the corresponding Nalik term tau
(Volker 1998: 132).","[218, 219, 220]"

243).63
The time of introduction of sweet potato in New Ireland is a difficult question,
but it appears not to have a very long history there. It was clearly there 100
years ago, as it is mentioned by Krämer-Bannow (1916) who travelled there in
1908–1909, and also by Parkinson (1999 [1907]: 341). Yet, taro seems to have
remained the main crop into the 1930’s, as Powdermaker (1971 [1933]) does
not even mention sweet potato in the account of her stay in 1929–1930. It is
hard to see why it would not have reached its present prominence earlier if it
had been there for a long time. Another pointer to recent introduction is the fact
that there is no Kuot name for it, and it is simply known by the Tok Pisin name
‘kaukau’. The fact that there is a multitude of species would suggest a longer
history, but Parkinson mentions only two kinds, and the most likely explanation
seems to be that people from New Guinea island who have settled in New Ireland have brought more and more varieties over the years.
Another recently introduced root crop is cassava (tapioca, manioc).
Bread fruit (gun, tree: ovǝliobu) is eaten when in season. Sago (Kuot and Tok
Pisin ‘saksak’) is processed and eaten primarily when there are shortages of
other crops.
Various leaves are used as vegetables. Some of these are cultivated, such as the
‘aibika’ and the ‘aupa’ which are common all over Papua New Guinea, and
pumpkin, of which the leaves are used as food more often than the fruits. Another is ‘kankong’. These appear to be recently introduced species. A type of
fern (Kuot sagu) is collected along some riverbeds. Taro leaves were also an
important vegetable when taro was more commonly grown. All are eaten
cooked. I know of one indigenous type of cucumber (Kuot kaplo); now other
cucumbers and squash are often planted, as well as several kinds of beans. Onions are popular but do not grow well on lower altitudes in the tropics; they are
sometimes bought in the stores in Kavieng.
Ginger (lǝrarǝna) and chilli are sometimes used for seasoning, but the food is
usually very mild, and most people do not like even slightly hot food. In the
past, ginger also had many magical uses.
Nut trees are often planted near the villages but nuts are collected from the bush
as well, the main species being ‘galip’ (Canarium, tree: ŋareobu, nut: kabo),
‘pau’ (Barringtonia, tree: lǝga, nut: lǝganǝm) and ‘talis’ (the Java almond, Terminalia catappa, tree: tǝlinǝma, nut: tǝlimunǝm). The coconut palm is very old
in the Pacific and was of high value. My impression is that its cultural importance was much bigger in the old days – I was told that cutting down somebody’s coconut palm would be avenged with death. It is almost certainly a lar63 The evidence is somewhat circumstantial, but the main indication is the increase inpig bone in middens in the New Guinea highlands around that time, marking the
emergence of the pig-centred culture still present in that region. It is believed that this
development was made possible by the high-yielding sweet potato.","[92, 93]"
"78KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: DIALECTS AND OTHER SUB-TYPES WITHIN THE LANGUAGEI could establish there was none in the past. There are indeed notions of spirits
in the bush or spirits of animals hunted, and there are practices to do with what
one says and does not say when out on such activities – but there is no separate
linguistic code.75
Child-directed speech has some particular phonological and morphological
features (see 3.8), as well as some specialised vocabulary, some of which is regional and some of which belongs to Kuot.
We may also touch briefly on songs here. We can identify three main categories
of songs in Kuot culture. First, there is a great variety of named types of songs
that were used in ritual activities of various sorts and usually had dances with
them; second, a large number of stories have little songs in them; and third,
there were everyday songs that people made up to comment on the day’s events
or just to amuse themselves in general. Only the last category tends to be entirely in Kuot.
In ceremonial songs, there are very frequently formulaic stretches, similar
across songs of a particular category, that are not meaningful in Kuot but function as a genre marker. For instance, in songs of the type lakobuma, sung at the
wake for a dead bigman, the first line almost always begins with something like
tiŋalenagarevuŋu (I do not segment this stretch, for lack of morphological information) or parts of it. I was told that the same sequence occurs in songs in
other languages in the region as well. It could be that it is meaningful in one of
the other languages, or in a now extinct language of the area.76 This type of
song was not composed in the ordinary manner, but given to people in dreams.
As for songs in narratives, a good story should have a song, and most of them
do. These are frequently not in Kuot. Sometimes speakers will recognise them
as Nochi or Madak, for instance, but in other cases no one seems to know. This
could be because of insufficient familiarity with non-adjacent languages, or because the song is in an extinct language, or because it simply is not in an actual
language. The story songs differ from the ceremonial songs in that one usually
does not find the recurring formulas, and also in that all or most of the song is
often in the foreign language (or non-language).77 It is likely that the songs in
75 Interestingly Eves (1998: 161) mentions the existence of such a language in theMadak-speaking Lelet area, but gives no linguistic clues apart from stating that it was
different from the vernacular. For an example of another such language in Papua New
Guinea, see Franklin (1972), who gives more of a linguistic analysis of the “pandanus
language” of the Kewa (Engan).
76 Codrington (1969 [1891]: 334ff) speaks of several Austronesian languages of Vanu-atu (New Hebrides) having separate dialects for songs. This, however, is a different
matter, as in Kuot ritual songs it is only a few phrases which are not transparent; the
rest of the song is in Kuot, although in some cases it is archaic.
77 Powdermaker (1971 [1933]) gives a number of songs and spells, parts of which arenot translatable in Nochi, hypothesising that they are in a forgotten language of the
past. However, it is quite typical for spells to contain incomprehensible bits; i.e., the
actual “mumbo jumbo” component. If words deriving from a different language are79TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTstories were at one point meaningful, but that they became corrupted as the
story moved away from the area where that language was spoken, through telling and retelling. This would tally with some stories having songs in Kuot,
some in Nochi and so forth. The songs usually occur if somebody is about to
die in the story; they sing, and others hurry to their rescue, they sing again and
so forth, and the rescuing party or person arrives just as the unfortunate person
dies.
Songs contain imagery which points to semantic connections not always obvious in the spoken language. The form of expression is often condensed, especially in the ritual songs, and the omissions can be telling in terms of the presuppositions present in the culture and therefore also to a degree in the language. Further, there are grammatical omissions that turn up in songs which do
not tend to occur in the spoken language – this could be because of the archaic
nature of some of the songs (representing earlier structures in the language), or
it could simply be a form of poetic licence to do with the genre.
The everyday songs, ditties, were mainly in Kuot, and later sometimes partly or
wholly in Tok Pisin.
Today, the Kuots still sing a lot, but the majority of songs are church songs; either Tok Pisin hymns or those from the Kuanua (Tolai language) hymnbook
used by the United Church. Quite a number of the latter have been translated
into Kuot by the Kuot Hymn Book Committee led by Chung (1994). The
church singing style has impacted also on the performance of traditional songs,
which used to be sung in unison, frequently to the beating of a log drum or
length of bamboo, but which are now often sung (if at all) in parts, without percussion, and with a regularised rhythm and tonality.
2.11
Language health
I estimate that there will be only a few Kuot speakers in 50 years. My estimation is based mainly on the situation I was able to observe in Bimun village, but
it does appear to be similar elsewhere.
Most elderly speakers are considered good speakers, and younger speakers will
refer to them for some inquiries; primarily to the men but sometimes to the
women if the question concerns things such as names for types of taro.
Speakers of about 30 years of age grew up with Kuot as the main language of
the village; that is, there is likely to have been Tok Pisin and perhaps Madak
elements, but at least on the west coast the play language of the children was
Kuot as late as the 1960’s. These speakers are full speakers, although they may
lack obsolete vocabulary items and are sometimes shy to record stories for fear
of elders criticizing their language. Still, I believe the variation between the
older generation and 30-year-olds is essentially within the natural developmentused, they are often much distorted (as with “hocus pocus” from the Latin mass) and
this would generalise to New Ireland too.","[100, 101, 102]"

special declension (ma):

‘2 tears’Noun stems in the plain declension are thus invariant in the sense that the nonsingular is simply added to the stem without modification; and also autonomous
in that they can be used “as is”. In the special declensions, however, there is a
problem with identifying the stem. The constant stem parts in the last two
examples above are *kubu and *ku but since the endings -nǝm and -ma are not
predictable from any general principles, and since the starred forms are not attested as phonological forms, we would not want to postulate them as stems.
These nouns may perhaps be said to have two related stem variants, one singular and one non-singular. The question of stem autonomy in the special declensions depends on the analysis of stem-hood for the singular forms – if an underlying stem like the starred forms were postulated, that underlying stem
137TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTwould of course require morphological processing even to form the singular,
i.e., it would be variable and non-autonomous. If, on the other hand, we accept
singular and plural stem variants, each is autonomous in the sense that it can be
used without such processing, and at least the singular stem would be autonomous. Dual forms are simply suffixed to the end of the non-singular form in
most cases.
Among the verbs, class I stems are largely invariant (apart from a final /a/ or /ǝ/
often being deleted before the third person singular masculine subject enclitic).
There is some reduplication, with effects such as iterative, distributive, duration
and intensity. Class I stems are autonomous in that they are used bare in citation, as action nominals, and in active form following the habitual auxiliary
-me; elsewhere in active use a subject enclitic is obligatory. Stems which are
transitive only require the object slot to be filled by the dummy object prefix uin citation and nominalisation.
Verb classes II and III differ quite markedly from class I. The stems show a fair
amount of morpho-phonological interaction with subject affixes, and some
stems also have alternate forms for future. In class II there are a few suppletive
stems (e.g. -num ‘walk’; -muŋ ‘walk.fut’). There is no reduplication in class II
or in the second part of the stem in class III, but the first part of the stem in class
III is occasionally reduplicated. These stems are not autonomous, but require
the subject affix slot to be filled at all times (in nominalisation, the second person singular affix is used).
Adjectives show morpho-phonological interaction with subject suffixes. There
is reduplication but it is non-productive and irregular, and has no discernible semantic impact. The suffixes that cross-reference third person are obligatory, and
remain as number markers in first and second person forms, which are marked
by prefixes, e.g.:
(2)kak-kan-i
RED-big-3m
‘he/it(m) is big’nu-kak-kan-i
2s-RED-big-sg
‘you(sg) are big’kak-kan-in
RED-big-3d
‘they(2) are big’ma-kak-kan-in
2d-RED-big-dl
‘you(2) are big’A few manner adverbs have reduplication (the semantic impact is not clear).
The forms are autonomous.
Locationals and directionals are invariant, but have certain compounding tendencies, whereby several items can be strung together. A few members in this
class are autonomous, while the majority require prefixation with a small set of
prefixes that have some proximity distinctions, but whose main function appears to be to form viable words. There is also the augment mentioned in 4.1.9
which causes stems to take slightly different affixes.
Demonstratives (4.1.10 above and 1.1.1) are of two types, simple and composite. The simple forms, which may function independently or as prefixes to loca138WORD CLASSES AND OVERVIEW OF MORPHOLOGY: MORPHOLOGYtional/directional forms or demonstrative stems, are invariant. In independent
use they are autonomous. The stems to which they are prefixed to form complex
demonstratives are invariant but all the demonstrative stems (i.e. those which
are not in the paradigm of locational/directionals) are bound and can only occur
prefixed.
Prepositions are invariant, except for bo ‘on’ which has the form buo when it
takes person-indexing prefixes. One further preposition, irǝ- ‘at (etc.)’ has some
phonological interaction with person suffixes. Some prepositions are autonomous while others require person affixes.
Numerals are invariant with the exception of the word for ‘ten’, mǝnaburuan,
which takes non-singular and dual forms in the formation of higher numbers
(nsg: mǝnaburualap, dl: mǝnaburualapien). The forms are autonomous.
Finally, pronouns are also invariable forms, although historically they appear
to be reduplicated forms of the morphemes which cross-reference and index the
same pronominal categories (there are no third person pronouns). They are
autonomous.
4.2.2
Affix – clitic – particle, a dependency cline
We will now turn to non-stems, i.e. affixes, clitics and particles. Kuot
grammatical morphemes show varying degrees of cohesion with or dependency
on other material, ranging from tightly integrated affixes via clitics to particles
that make up independent words. This section will discuss the properties of
each type, as well as some problems that arise in categorising the morphemes.
First, I will propose definitions of prototypical affixes, clitics and particles for
Kuot.
For Kuot, a prototypical affix is defined as a morpheme
 with grammatical meaning
 adhering to particular classes of morphemes (e.g. verb or sub-class of verb)
 forming a close unit with the morpheme to which it adheres (in terms of
being obligatorily selected, not allowing for pausing, often having morphophonological alterations at the boundary, etc.)
For Kuot, a prototypical clitic is defined as a morpheme
 with grammatical or lexical meaning
 adhering to the first constituent in a phrase
For Kuot, a prototypical particle is defined as a morpheme
 with grammatical meaning
 not attaching to another constituent
As will be seen in the following, even these rather minimal definitions cause
conflicts in some cases, and several morphemes straddle the categories. Instead
of discrete categories, it is therefore useful to think of these categorisations as
prototypes along a continuum, or cline, as schematised in Figure 1.","[158, 159, 160, 161]"

Principles of glossing
In this book, a phonemic system is used, with neither phonological nor morphophonological processes applied.
Each example that gives stretches longer than a single word has three lines: the
Kuot data line; a morpheme-by-morpheme translation of the Kuot in the interlinear gloss line, and the free translation line. Free translations are aimed at
giving as exact as possible an idea of the meaning of the entire utterance.
Sometimes this means that the words used in the interlinear gloss are not the
same as those used in the translation; for example if a lexeme kup´lip meaning
‘dry leaves from cooking’ is used in the gloss it may be judged that ‘rubbish’ is
the equivalent sense in the particular context, and ‘rubbish’ will be used in the
free translation.
Everywhere in this work, Kuot words, morphemes and sentences are given in
italics, as are occasional words from other languages in the area. English
translations are given in single quotes (‘ ’), and it was decided to give Tok Pisin
words in the same way.
Most of the data reproduced in examples are from texts. Capitalisation, commas
and stops are used to indicate intonational units as follows:
• A capitalised initial letter indicates the beginning of a sentence (and also
proper names)
• A comma (,) indicates the end of an intonation unit with a continuation
(rising) contour
• A stop (.) indicates the end of an intonation unit with final (falling) contourxABBREVIATIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF GLOSSINGStops, hyphens and equal signs indicate different types of morph and morpheme
boundaries. The graphic distance they create is iconic to the degree of
integration of the morphemes thus combined. Stops (.) only occur in the interlinear gloss in this function, as it is used to separate the two glosses belonging
to an indivisible morph, and also to connect the words of a multi-word gloss
(e.g. ‘coconut.palm’ and ‘get.up’). A hyphen (-) indicates an affix boundary,
while an equal sign (=) indicates a clitic boundary. For some morphemes, apparent inconsistencies result from irregularities in the language; for instance the
non-singular morpheme on nouns (‘nsg’) is sometimes given in the gloss with a
stop and sometimes with a hyphen. This is because although the plural form
always ends in -p, segmenting it off the non-singular form often does not leave
an acceptable form of the lexeme. Compare:
(1)singular
kit
kiban
kikinǝmgloss
fire
leg
earnon-singular gloss
kit-ip
fire-nsg
kibǝp
leg.nsg
kikip
ear.nsgAffix and clitic boundaries are marked on the line giving the Kuot data as well,
and it should be noted that it is represented without phonological and morphological processes applied. For example, kit in (1) is pronounced [kit], but kit-ip
is pronounced [kirip].
Forward slashes are sometimes used in glosses and occasionally in translations
to indicate alternative translation possibilities for a morpheme (e.g. -on´ma
sit/live/stay) or a phrase.
Angle brackets (< >) are used on all three lines to indicate hesitation and repair.
If empty, it means that there is an unfilled hesitation pause. If there is a repair
sequence it is given within the angle brackets (and glossed). In yet other cases
the repaired sequence has been omitted in the interest of space or to make the
example easier to follow; this is represented as <…>.
Square brackets ([ ]) and regular brackets (( )) are used in translations in the
following way: Square brackets indicate words which are part of the Kuot data
given, but which are very unidiomatic in English, as in the use of demonstratives together with possessives, which will give translations such as ‘[this] his
brother’. Regular brackets indicate words in the English translation which are
required by the grammar of English, but which are not present in the Kuot data
given. In some cases this is done also where the English is very much more
specific than the Kuot, in particular for the relator l´, which is in itself very
vague in meaning. It is simply glossed RELR, but for instance in its clause
joining function it may have one of several meanings such as ‘when’ and ‘because’; when introducing relative clauses it can mean ‘who’, ‘which’ and so
forth. Any such English word in the translation is given in regular brackets to
indicate that that meaning is not part of the Kuot data – or at any rate not with
that degree of specificity.
The covert category of gender is given for a noun ((m) or (f)) only where another constituent shows agreement with it.xiPREFACE
The title on the cover of this dissertation, Topics in the grammar of Kuot, is designed to allow for a less than unitary collection of subjects within. It makes it
possible to shamelessly lump together such diverse topics as phonology, kinship, and nouns in the same volume, as long as they pertain to the Kuot language, or its speakers. The background to this is that the original PhD project
was a full descriptive grammar of Kuot. Somehow the draft manuscript kept
growing and growing, but the end of the project remained elusively at a constant distance of “about six months”, while evermore pages were being added.
When graduation was long overdue, all respectable funding possibilities had
been exhausted for over a year, and exciting linguistic projects requiring a PhD
appeared on the horizon, my supervisors Kari and Östen stepped in. They
wisely suggested that I present some sections of the work for the degree, so that
I could move on to greener linguistic pastures while continuing to revise additional chapters with a view to eventually publishing the full grammar.
Two main criteria were used to select the chapters to go into the dissertation:
autonomy and overview. The socio-cultural chapter and the chapters about
nouns and phonology were judged to be relatively free from cross-reference to
chapters omitted in this version. To compensate in some degree for missing
chapters, overviews of Kuot grammar are provided in the introduction and word
classes chapters.
There are many people without whom I could never had carried out this work.
First of all, it would not have happened at all if Bob Dixon and Sasha Aikhenvald had not invited me to Australia to do linguistic fieldwork. Their Research
Centre for Linguistic Typology not only provided an enormously stimulating
working environment, but also paid for fieldwork expenses (even from Australia, the cost of airfares to Papua New Guinea is excruciating). Bob has read and
commented on all drafts, some of them in several versions, and by appointment
undertook the boring but sadly necessary task of nagging me about overdue
chapters. Both Bob and Sasha were always supportive and happy to discuss any
matter linguistic, and I feel that being able to share their extensive experience
and that of other members of the centre has contributed a lot to my development
as a linguist and a member of the linguistic community.

"172NOUNS: NUMBER: USAGEThese forms differ from the kin terms we saw above in several respects. First,
there are no alternative regular forms. Second, the non-regular endings themselves are different. Here, the female dual forms end in -bie rather than -rie (although the male form kulen is on the same pattern as the male kin duals ending
in -n).27 In the non-singular, both makabun and kubebun end in -ulǝp (slightly
different from -ilup in kin terms). Kulǝmut and kulen share the suppletive nonsingular lop, and kulǝmut has the related dual form lobie while kulot has kulen.
None of these forms represent general processes or patterns (although nonsingular -ulǝp and -ilǝp are found with a few more words in the bun declension;
see 5.2.4 above).
5.5
Number: usage
The form of cross-referencing, indexing and agreement morphemes always follows the number (and gender) of the noun. This section is about the factors that
determine the number of nouns.
Dual number is used primarily for humans, where two referents are consistently
coded with dual form. For inanimates, even obviously paired things such as legs
and eyes are normally expressed with the non-singular (plural) form without the
dual suffix. The dual can be used with inanimates if the fact that there are two
of something is particularly stressed or salient in the context, and it is obligatory
following the numeral ‘two’.
Regarding non-singular, essentially all instances of reference to more than one
entity are coded as such, with the non-singular form for plural (or dual) referents. One area of exceptions concerns respectful usage in avoidance relations
among certain kin, particularly between siblings and cross-cousins of different
sex. The kin system, the terms and their usage are described in 2.6. This usage
is not productive and is only used with the particular kin terms for which it is
established, and is disappearing even there. The address term for same-sex inlaw of the same generation (i.e., spouse’s same-sex sibling), makapien, traditionally required dual agreement, and is still used that way by some speakers.
Remarkably, mixed singular and dual agreement is sometimes found with
makapien (otherwise never allowed in Kuot):
(35)na-ga
ma-la
2sS-want/be about to 2dS-go
‘where are you going?’lakum?
whereThis can thus also be rendered ma-ga ma-la lakum? or, less politely, na-ga
na-la lakum?. Different-sex cross-cousins are addressed with non-singular
forms, including the term itself: kokolep/kokolaip, rather than kokole (sg).
Other exceptions to following factual referent number, as we shall see, are similar to what is found in other languages which regularly mark number on nouns.
Where singular is used for more than one referent, it is primarily to do with

"92PHONOLOGY: CONSONANTS3.2.2.4 /n/ vs. /l/ – allophony and phonemic contrast
This section will discuss the variability and non-variability of /n/ and /l/ (and [n]
and [l]) in their various positions. It will be seen that the distinction is stable in
medial position, but has some variability in stem-final position which makes
reference to the syllable, and also some variability in initial position which
makes reference to other factors.
The phonemic differentiation between /l/ and /n/ is the clearest where they occur in intervocalic (medial) position in the middle of stems, e.g. in these two
stems from verb class II:
(25)-pinǝ
-pilǝdance
be ripe, ready to eatVerb class II is a closed class, and is thought to be the oldest verb class in the
language (cf. 1.1.2.1), so the fact that it contains minimal pairs such as these is
an indication that the phonemic distinction between /l/ and /n/ in intervocalic
position is not recent in the language.
As noted earlier, the stem-initial position in this verb class is never word-initial,
since the stems are bound forms with obligatory subject prefixes, and in this respect stem-initial segments are intervocalic rather than initial. The presence of
two minimal pairs for /n/ vs. /l/ in stem-initial position in this verb class thus
provides support for the statement that the differentiation between /n/ and /l/ in
intervocalic position is quite clear (while the situation in word-initial position is
another matter):
(26)-num
-lumwalk
fall-na
-lareturn
goFor one noun, age-based variation in medial position was reported: suanǝbǝlat/
sualǝbǝlat ‘stick for putting out fire in mumu’ where the pronunciation with [n]
is used by older speakers and [l] by younger speakers.
As stated above, /l/ is not possible in final position, and segments pronounced
[l] intervocalically are realised as [n] when final, the two sounds being in an
allophonic relation in this position:
(27)gun [gʊn]gun-up [gʊlʊp}]breadfruitIt would appear that resyllabification takes place, giving the non-singular form
/gu.lup/ (see also (30) below).
Many words ending in /n/ in the singular have deviant non-singular forms (e.g.
sg: muan, nsg: muap; see further 5.2), but of those that do form non-singular by
addition of the non-singular suffix -(i)p (which assimilates to -up in some contexts), about half were given with the [n] retained in the non-singular, and the
other half with [l]. However, although there is a tendency for particular words
to have either [n] or [l], both are possible for all words ending in [n] in the singular and taking the non-singular ending, for instance:
(28)kapuon [kawɔn]kapuon-up [kawɔnʊp}] ~ [kawɔlʊp}]goatfish93TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTThere is no clear pattern to the distribution of [n] vs. [l] in the words that do
show a preference, in terms of stress or surrounding phonemes, except for a
tendency for words containing /l/ elsewhere to retain a final [n] when the nonsingular is added.
That the [n] to [l] variation is productive is demonstrated by Tok Pisin loan
words such as the following, where the non-singular forms are typically pronounced with [l]:
(29)sippun [sɪpʊn]
sospen [sɔspɛn]sippun-up [sɪpʊlup}]
sospen-ip [sɔspɛlip}]spoon
saucepanThe data presented thus far has shown that there is not a sharp differentiation
between the phones [n] and [l] in final position, but is not sufficient to argue for
either /n/ or /l/ as the underlying phoneme. A further example shows that [l] is
disallowed not only word-finally but syllable-finally. The example is the word
for ‘blood’ in two different pronunciations:
(30)general pronunciation:
olǝbuan blood
archaic(?) pronunciation: onbuan bloodThe variant given as archaic was reported to me as the pronunciation of a particular speaker’s grandmother and may simply represent intra-speaker variation
without indicating that the form was in more general use in earlier times. My
data has no syllable-final instances of [l] (although [n] does occur, e.g. kunmǝra
‘scorpion’ and matakinkin ‘snail (sp.)’), but what is interesting about example
(30) is the equivalence of [n] and [l] in the same word when a vowel is inserted.
Somewhat similarly, there is dialectal variation in the form of the following
verb stem:
(31)southern Kuot: kakkǝn
northern Kuot: kakkalecarry child on shoulder (V cl I)Younger speakers make a distinction between /l/ and /n/ in final position in Tok
Pisin and in loans from Tok Pisin (e.g., ‘wilwil’, ‘bicycle’) while elderly speakers frequently pronounce both as [n], and for instance the Kuot-speaking village
Kabil on the east coast is usually pronounced [kabin] by the older group. (The
village was established in the 20th century in Nochi-speaking territory, and the
place name is presumably in the Nochi language.) Nevermann, publishing some
of Walden’s notes from 1907–1909 (Walden & Nevermann 1941), uses the
spelling “Kul” for the (former) village Kun in the north of the Kuot territory,
suggesting that the northern dialect may have been less strict in disallowing a
final [l].
A further set of words show a variation of [n] to [l] associated with the nonsingular. This concerns some of the nouns in the special declensions, where the
declension-identifying ending contains [n]; this is sometimes converted to [l] in
the non-singular, e.g.:
(32)94sg: kǝsonǝma
sg: lǝganǝm
sg: marabunansg: kǝsolǝp
mango tree
nsg: lǝgalup
nut (sp.)
nsg: marabulǝp nipplePHONOLOGY: CONSONANTSAnother context triggering the variation is the future forms of some verb stems
in classes II and III. This variation is not productive, but in all cases where a
non-future stem ends in [n] and has a future form involving an addition to the
non-future form, the [n] becomes [l], e.g.:
(33)tarak-u-ban
vomit-3mS-stm2
‘he vomits/vomited’tarak-a-bǝluŋ (class III)
vomit-3mS.fut-stm2.fut
‘he will vomit’(34)me-in
3pS-stand
‘they stand/stood’me-iliŋ (class II)
3pS-stand.fut
‘they will stand’Since the morphological variation here is no longer productive, these examples
serve to show that the phonological variation “frozen” in the forms is likely to
be quite old in the language.
It should be pointed out that not all morphemes following a final [n] trigger the
alternation; only the non-singular on nouns (and the obsolete future marking on
some verbs) do so.3
In initial position, there is again an amount of variability, although most words
beginning in [n] or [l] are stable. The variation here is different from that found
in final positions, and depends on factors such as the grammatical class of the
morpheme, and the dialect and age of the speaker. There is also inter-speaker
variation among speakers of the same generation and dialect, and in some cases
variation in the speech of an individual.
Grammatical morphemes, and to an extent lexical morphemes from closed
classes, are more likely to be changeable than open-class lexical ones. There
also appears to be more variability in the northern dialect, so that [l] in the
southern dialect frequently corresponds to [n] in the north. For example, while
speakers in the south mainly use the form laurup for the adverb ‘down’, this is
often (but not always) rendered as naurup in the north. Particular other forms
are prone to variation. Thus for instance nǝmo/lǝmo ‘want, say, be about to;
COMPLementiser’ is subject to inter-speaker variation whereby one speaker of
about 30 years of age in Bimun in the south consistently uses nǝmo in all functions, while another Bimun speaker of the same age consistently uses lǝmo (the
first is male and the second is female, but I have found no general gender correlation of this variation). One speaker of about 30 years of age, in Panaras in
the north, consistently uses the form [ni] for the third person dual subject prefix
in verb classes II and III which is normally li- (and [niɔŋ] for the subject enclitic =lioŋ of verb class I).
There is also intra-speaker variation, so that one speaker may vary within his or
her speech, although this is rather limited. For example in one story by an elderly Bimun speaker, lǝmo occurs once in the sense ‘want/be about to’ while the
3 In this, final [n] behaves like final /t/, whose allophone [r] is triggered in preciselythese contexts, but unlike /p/ and /k/ whose allophony is triggered in any intervocalic
position.","[114, 115, 116, 117]"

The ma declension
The ma declension is by far the largest of the special declensions, with 142
members in my data (nearly 16% of all nouns). The words in this declension are
the most homogenous both with regard to gender and to non-singular formation.
With two exceptions, they are masculine, the exceptions being bunima ‘lastborn’ whose gender follows the sex of the referent, and arǝma ‘pandanus fruit
(sp.)’ which is feminine. Words in the ma declension form their non-singular by
subtracting -ma and adding -p, as shown in example (7).4

man, maleAmong the 142 words in this declension, there is a subgroup of 27 words ending in -nǝma. They are all masculine, but some deviate in their non-singular
formation. Fifteen of them take the same type of non-singular as the bulk of ma
words, and four have it as an alternative, but several patterns show up among
the rest. All involve subtraction, usually of all of -nǝma, and then addition of -p
or a longer form ending in -p, as exemplified in (8). It appears that non-singular
formation in this subgroup is quite unstable, as sometimes several forms have
been attested for the same word. Only a few examples will be given here:

mountain/R in the dual column indicates that the dual form given to me was based on the
second of the non-singular forms (mǝbilǝpupien).
Interestingly, the [n]/[l] alteration observed at the very end of words in the
regular non-singular formation (see 3.2.2.4, and 5.2.11 and 5.2.3 below]) is here
found quite far into the word (and is an option also for murulǝp and murulǝpup); this is another indication that the original stem ended with (or before)
/n/, and -(ǝ)ma or -nǝma was added on at some point in time.
Another interesting point about these non-singular forms is the -pup ending. As
set out above, the non-singular suffix is normally -(i)p. The form -pup looks as
though the non-singular had been applied twice (the bilabial stop /p/ in the first
application would cause labialisation harmony in the second application, mak4 Information is lacking for eight words.","[174, 175]"
"156NOUNS: DECLENSIONS AND NON-SINGULAR FORMRegarding the terms for male and female rats or mice, they are not actually used
that way of rodents, for which the masculine kifǝma is used, but instead of human children; see 5.6.3.1. Alternative forms are kispǝma and kispebun.
5.2.5
The bu declension
There are ten words in the bu declension. Eight of these are feminine; six denote fruit or nut trees. One word is given different gender by different speakers,
lerabu banana stump. The other masculine word is kanakanotubu ‘sorcerer’,
and I was told that it could be applied to a woman too if she exhibits the behaviour associated with the word (typically standing behind other people’s
houses at night); the word would then take feminine agreement.
Non-singulars either replace -bu with -lǝp (with some vowel variation preceding
the endings), or add -p to the end of the full singular form:

of nirobu – nurǝlǝp, the similarity to the most general word for the coconut,
nur, is obvious.7 The other words for trees do not have related stems for fruits or
nuts. It seems possible that the -(V)bu ending derives from a word meaning tree
or fruit tree and we may note also that it is the words with this meaning that
take the non-singular ending with -lǝp. The words taking the simple -p nonsingular may end in -bu coincidentally, not the least considering that lerabu is
also singled out as different by being given masculine gender by some speakers.
5.2.6
The uom declension
This is another small declension, with eight members, all feminine. There is no
apparent semantic unity. Non-singular is formed by subtracting -om and adding
-p in all cases but one, and dual is regular (where known):7 It could be that the /i/ of the singular form is a result of vowel drift. (The word nurfor ‘coconut’ exists also in Austronesian Nalik and could be a loan).","[178, 179]"
"52KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: KINSHIPcategory of songs used primarily for the paternal aunties to sing while carrying
parcels of food to the nephew (or indeed niece); the songs were called sǝpda
and their purpose was to celebrate the nephew or niece.
It is interesting that both joking relations, the nabar and kokup relations, are
close-kin cross-moiety relations. They can both be said to express dangerous
forces: sexuality vis-a-vis a close relative (albeit of the opposite moiety), and
rudeness and stealing and so forth on levels that are not acceptable anywhere
else within the system; both forces that normally have to be contained.
The behavioural requirements of these different types of relationships lead to
what superficially seems like inconsistent behaviour, as an individual may vary
between easy-going, subdued and rude depending on who else is present.
Breeches of taboos in the past were punished differently depending on the nature of the crime. It was always the bigmen who determined the sentence.
Smaller crimes, perhaps touching a distant sister’s hair, were fined, shell money
and or pigs to be given to the injured party or his or her (male) relatives. Any
sexual relations within the same clan were considered serious cases of incest
and were sometimes punished by death, whereby the convicted person had to
commit suicide (usually by hanging; see further 2.7 for comments on death).
There are some categories of people who are largely exempt from kin-based
rules. Children were mentioned above. Crazy people also cannot be expected to
always follow the established rules of society, nor foreigners from faraway
places such as Australia or Sweden. Modern times have also brought situations
in which many rules have to be suspended, such as the crowded transports to
Kavieng. This has contributed to a general weakening of the rules, which have
also been undermined by the acceptance of Christianity by the population,
whereby the force of much everything related to custom has been diminished.
The system operates and is very salient, but the force is lesser and the only
punishment of breeches that I am aware of is social disapproval (which is of
course not the least of motivations in human life).
A large number of relationships stem from birth, and more are added through
marriage. Even given the prescribed behaviour concomitant with particular kin
relations, personality and personal preferences are of course essential to the nature of the relationship that any individual actually has with another. As mentioned, locality also factors in, so that actual relationships are built and maintained through interaction, for which the persons need to be in the same place.
2.6.5
Name taboos and alternative forms of address
A component common to all relationships characterized by respect is the name
taboo. Two people in such a relation are not to say the each other’s name, and if
a woman’s brother’s name is John, she is not to use the name John of any other
man by that name either. Instead appellations such as ‘the husband of Lin’ or
‘the father of Joel’ are used. A man can refer to his sister as ‘the mother of the
children’, for instance when inquiring at her homestead of her whereabouts.
Even in public addresses at village meetings, the announcer will use descrip-53TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTtions such as ‘the in-law in Okoiok’ rather than reading out the name of a taboo
relative from a list.
In the community, of course everybody knows what the relationships of others
are, and that makes it easier to work out who is meant (as you will know who
cannot be mentioned by a speaker), but there are still frequent misunderstandings, and it is common for an interlocutor to fill in the name if it is one that they
are allowed to say. Sometimes a third party is called upon to pronounce the
name of ‘the auntie in Kabil’ and so forth. Taking down a genealogy tends to
involve a whole group of people and a fair amount of yelling across the village
so that all names can be said.
The name taboos are mostly reciprocal, and mostly cover both address and third
person mention, but there are a few exceptions. A woman can say the name of
her brother’s wife (both to and about her), but not vice versa. A man may only
say the name of a man married to his sister when that man is out of earshot.
Other alternative forms of address or mention for people whom one is allowed
to address at all are by kin term (though not all terms appear to be used in this
way), physical characteristics (e.g. piek ‘bald person’) or other properties (e.g.
ŋoŋ ‘crazy person’), or function. Given the extremely low degree of professional specialisation in this society, function may have come in only in fairly
recent times (e.g. komiti for the chairman of the village council, or pasta for the
pastor).
Nicknames also exist, and are exempt from the taboo. For instance, one man has
been known as Sikarama ‘dry twig’ ever since he was a child because he was so
skinny, and people who are not allowed to pronounce his name quite happily
use the nickname.
Name taboos are not entirely defining of the nature of the relationship, in several ways. First, the core – periphery principle set out in 2.6.3 means that more
respectful behaviour is accorded a “real” brother than a “distant” brother (by a
woman), but the name taboo still applies to both. While a woman avoids many
types of interaction with her real brother, she may be heard telling a distant
brother to stop telling lies and get on with the job, in direct address. Second,
names are avoided (but not taboo) in several relationships which are not avoidance relationships, as a sign of respect. This applies from children to parents in
most families, and from niece or nephew to maternal uncle. I have also heard a
woman ask for her husband and a mother for her grown son in roundabout
ways; these are just personal choices and subject to inter- and intra-speaker
variation. A further feature of name taboos is that they apply more strictly to
indigenous names than to so called Christian names (i.e. names having come in
through Western mediation, ranging from Ezekiel to Benny, and from Ruth to
Roslyn), but still speakers are very unwilling to use either.
A special relationship also holds between two persons called by the same name,
and they are not to refuse each other anything. The namesake relation is called
bekulǝ and this term is often used in address between the two, stressing the
bond.
54KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: OTHER ETHNOGRAPHIC NOTESA very interesting aspect of some of the respect relationships is non-singular
address for singular referents. A man and his brother-in-law, and a woman and
her sister-in-law generally address each other with the term makapien. This has
the form of a regular dual, but there is no corresponding singular or non-singular (plural) form. Address traditionally was with dual cross-referencing on
verbs, and this is still heard in some cases, or even with mixed second person
singular and dual forms. Similarly, if a man had to address his female crosscousin, he would use a plural form of the term kokole: kokolaip. The expression
‘mother of the children’ mentioned above was also frequently in the plural (nagap meiam lop ‘mothers of the children’, or using the name of a child e.g. nagap iam Ruth ‘mothers of Ruth’); correspondingly the woman could refer to her
brother as irap am Eskol ‘fathers of Eskol’. It is possible that there were more
such usages in the past. The ones given here are remembered and used occasionally, but are disappearing.
2.7
Other ethnographic notes
It is quite difficult to get a reliable picture of anything from the past, and accounts of almost any aspect of life often vary wildly between different speakers.
What is presented here has been pieced together with the aid of accounts from
different speakers, sometimes evaluated in the light of some of the historical
and current information on neighbouring peoples (while trying not to be too influenced by these, as it is likely that there were differences), and also using
plausibility as a criterion.38
2.7.1
Rituals in life and death
Malagan (/malangan/malanggan) is the term both for a cycle of ritual feasts and
for dance masks and other carvings associated with them. It appears that this
ritual complex is only a few centuries old, and that it may have originated in the
Tabar island group (off the east coast of New Ireland). I showed some photos of
masks and carvings in German collections, and they were identified by elderly
speakers as Tabar or Madak style. It was claimed that Kuot had a style of its
own, but I was not able to establish what characterised it. Given the low level of
identification according to language it is likely that the spread of particular
styles did not follow language boundaries. One speaker said that the Kuot
carvings were like those of Amba (Aba, Hamba) village, which is a Nochispeaking village on the east coast. Powdermaker (1971 [1933]) also describes
how the rights to make particular malagan designs (each with its own name)
were bought and sold between clans, and any particular design seems to have
been able to move around quite a bit.39
38 For instance, one speaker claimed that women were secluded for a period of severalyears during puberty, and that they each ate one pig a day. This has to be rejected on
grounds of implausibility, and other accounts by the same speaker were similarly fanciful and so had to be treated with some caution.
39 Similarly, dances (with songs) passed between different groups, and Krämer-Ban-now reports one dance all the way from Rabaul having been performed in Madak-55TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTAs for the ceremonial cycle, this is described in some detail by Powdermaker
(1971 [1933]) and Lewis (1969) for the Nochi, and since the ceremonies may be
taken to have been very similar in all important respects, and since they are no
longer practiced among the Kuots, I will only give the briefest summary here.40
Malagan feasts had multiple functions. They were the final ceremony in a sequence of mortuary rites, and at the same time the biggest feast associated with
the initiation of adolescent boys. Various other outstanding matters for clans
would be settled too. For a man, arranging a malagan feast was one of the most
important ways of gaining prestige.
After death, bigmen and possibly any old people were cremated, but it is not
clear what happened to ordinary people; in the mountains there appear to have
been burials in the ground, and near the coast it is possible that some corpses
were sunk at sea but I have no statement of the latter from the Kuots.41 In the
case of important bigmen it appears that the skull was often kept in the men’s
house and used in magic (taro and rain magic?) and perhaps other practices.
Preparations for the feast would start not long after the death. At a meeting various people would indicate how many pigs they intended to contribute by sticking the hard midrib (sokopit) of the coconut leaf in the ground. These people
could be children, in-laws, uncles or others with a relation to the dead person.
Failing to deliver when the time came caused social shame and derision of the
worst degree. Piglets then had to be acquired and raised, and about six months
before the ceremony, taro gardens would be cleared and planted, and magic
made to ensure the growth. Malagan carvings were ordered and the carver began to carve them. At each stage of preparation, a small feast would be held.
Weather magicians were paid to ensure good weather for the day or days of the
feast.
After death, a person’s spirit roams around, and particularly in the first days or
weeks may appear as a ghost, make noises such as knocking on the walls and
bothering the living in general, visiting the places that the person used to visit in
life. Various tests were carried out to check if the spirit was still around, such as
throwing small pieces of food in the fire; if it crackled it meant that the spirit
was present, “eating” the food. The mortuary feast finally removes the dead
person’s spirit from among the living. According to Kuot informants, severalspeaking Lamasong as the emperor’s birthday was celebrated in 1909 (Krämer-Bannow 1916: 96–97).
40 More general works on the malagan traditions in north-central New Ireland includeGunn (1997), Hallinan (1990) Helfrich (1973), and Krämer (1925), all of which also
have very good pictures of the associated artwork.

in Baranat near Muliama in the south of New Ireland, and by Parkinson (1999 [1907]:

"149It appears that those of the special declensions where a full syllable is taken off
in the non-singular were historically formed by addition of that syllable to a
prior singular form of the noun. In example (1) above, the earlier form would
have been *kirai. Some of the declensions show a degree of semantic unity,
which suggests that the ending once had semantic content, although this is presently obscured in many cases. Most of these endings further have relatively
constant gender associations, which may be an indication that the endings were
originally nouns themselves, perhaps in a compound relation to the stems of
which they are now part. The exceptions to these statements are primarily the n
and m declensions, identified by the final segment rather than a full syllable;
these groups of words are inconsistent both in gender and in non-singular formation. Further discussion of some of these issues is given in 5.2.12 below, after the presentation of the declensions.
There is also a group of nouns sharing a non-singular suffix -bip; this is not associated with a particular singular form but cuts across declensions. A few more
patterns deviate from general rules or patterns found in particular declensions;
these are also discussed after the declensions have been presented.
Before presenting the data, a few comments need to be made on its reliability.
As may be expected, many non-singular forms have been elicited starting from
singular forms and vice versa, and this is true of dual forms to an even larger
extent. This was necessary to get a respectable database size for understanding
the patterns of non-singular and dual formation, and as we shall see there is indeed much variation. But although this would appear to be an area where elicitation could be quite successful, it became apparent that elicited data was not
always reliable: most informants tire quickly when working from a list, and
there is a danger of over-regularisation when words are presented one after the
other out of context (more so for some informants than others). But there is also
an amount of instability in parts of the system, so that forms acceptable to one
speaker are not always acceptable to others. I suspect that a minority of the
forms given below may not be the forms used by most speakers, and that in
some cases non-singular forms have been produced where none are normally
used. Nevertheless, it would be impossible to get a full picture of the systematic
relationships between singular, non-singular and dual forms if only spontaneously produced forms were to be accepted.
Some of the declensions are very large, some very small, and some in between.
Small declensions are given in full, and in the interest of space a line has been
drawn at 25; declensions larger than that are only exemplified. For the latter, I
have tried to include only words where I have attested both singular and nonsingular forms in non-elicited situations. In spite of efforts to gather complete
information on the forms for the three numbers and gender information for singular forms for as many nouns as possible, information is still lacking for some
(especially with respect to dual forms).","[171, 172]"

may note that pǝpparak ‘food’ is related to parak ‘eat’ (see also 5.8.1 below).
Two more words have non-singular forms ending in -iap, namely ubi – ubiap
‘garden’ and popori – poporiap ‘story’; however, the words themselves end in
/i/, and so the non-singular ending may equally be -ap, since this ending occurs
in a couple of other words in the data. It is one of two possibilities for arubu
‘night’ and one of four for kaure ‘trivia’ (both given in (28)), and is used also in
kilan – kilalap ‘hand, arm’. Pianǝm – pialap ‘village’ of the nǝm declension

base for the dual). All are in the plain declension:

ending is frequently removed in the non-singular, and it is possible that the remaining part of the stem, /la/, has then been reduplicated (although reduplication is not a productive process with nouns). The shorter plural for ‘finger’ is
also similar to the singular.
5.4
Non-singular and dual with kin terms and human nouns
A number of human nouns have special non-singular and dual forms. Kin terms
are particularly interesting in that many of them have regular duals and nonsingulars alongside the special dual and non-singular forms, with different
meaning. Some other human nouns also have special dual forms.
5.4.1
Kin terms
A set out in 2.6, kin terms in Kuot are typically reciprocal, so that the term can
be said to refer to the relation type rather than the persons connected by it. For
example, the word eia(/aia/ieia/iaia) means both ‘grandparent’ and ‘grandchild’. Both the grandparent and the grandchild can refer to and address each
other by the term, and we could say it applies to a “grandrelation”.
Several terms of this type have special dual and non-singular forms, which
contrast with regular dual and non-singular forms, and have different application. In the duals there are also sometimes particular forms for pairs of females.
This is the only area of the language where gender is morphologically differentiated in forms which are not in the singular.19 For eia, we get the following
forms (The variability in base across these forms is probably accidental, and
presumably all forms could be produced on any of aia, iaia, eia or ieia):
(32)eia/aia etc. grandrelation (sg)
eian
grandparent with grandchild, minimum one male (dl)
eiarie
grandmother with granddaughter (dl)
aiailup
granparents with grandchildren (has to have two generations; nsg)
eiapien
2 grandparents or 2 grandchildren (regular dl)
eiap
grandparents or grandchildren (regular nsg)The forms that are unique for the kin terms, here eian, eiarie and aiailup, refer
to combinations of people connected to each other by the kin relation designated to the term, but not to people on one side of it, as it were. In other words,
19 There is a single example among adjectives of gender being distinguished in the plu-ral: mago- ‘good’ which has masculine plural magoim and feminine plural magom.","[190, 191]"
"103TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTThe recording conditions were not optimal for phonetic analysis (on an open
veranda in Bimun village) and pitch extraction has not worked in the first syllable in Figure 1b.
From the graphs, it seems clear that the length of each stem is equivalent relative to the following ending. However, for both speakers, it is the case that both
syllables are longer in absolute time in the second word in each pair, that
meaning ‘thunder’. This opens up the possibility that we are dealing with stress,
as there is good reason to believe that stress in Kuot is manifested primarily
through duration, and that high pitch is not a criterion for a stressed syllable
(see 3.5 below), although we do also find greater pitch movement in the second
member of the pair for both speakers. The subject enclitics of verb class I also
frequently attract stress, and it could be the case that a situation with two stressed morphemes causes the whole grammatical word to be longer. A prosodic
feature “tense” over the entire syllable could be another possibility, but has not
been investigated.
3.3.2

result in a long vowel, e.g.:

fish’ (although /ou/ is often pronounced [ǝʊ]), and only one case of /ui/ with /u/
as an on-glide: tuiŋ [twɪŋ]; these are marginal enough not to have been included
in (54). Of the remaining logical possibilities, /eu/, /iu/ and /ui/ are not attested
among the off-glides, and /ue/ is not attested among the on-glides.
/au/ and /ou/ are given in parentheses because there is very little constriction, so
that the last segment is [ʊ] rather than [w].
Wherever possible, the sequence is given in three positions in the example:
syllable-initial, in a closed syllable, and following a consonantal onset. It can be
seen that off-glides do not make up syllables on their own, with the exception of
/ai/.
Of the attested sequences, /ua/ is the most frequent, followed by /ai/ and /au/,
while /oi/, /ou/, /io/ and /ua/ are the least common.
In arriving at the analysis that the vowel sequences in example (54) are not
diphthongs or vowels + glides, the following definitions have been used
(adapted from Clark & Yallop (1995: 74)):
DIPHTHONG: a single vowel phonemically but with two articulatory targets,making up the nucleus of a syllable in the same way a single vowel in the language would
VOWEL + GLIDE (or GLIDE + VOWEL): one of the sounds constitutes the peak ofthe nucleus, while the other, usually a high vowel, has less prominence (and in
some cases also consonantal features)The main argument against a vowel + glide analysis is the fact that vowel sequences produced through affixation are also pronounced as vowel + glide
combinations, e.g.:
(55)i-abǝ ['jabǝ]
u-abǝ ['wabǝ]she climbs
he climbs(but i-la [i'la] she walks)
(but u-la [u'la] he walks)The underlying forms of the subject prefixes here are /i/ and /u/, but before another vowel they are pronounced as the glides [j] and [w].
Syllabification is both an argument against diphthongs and a potential argument
for a glide analysis, in particular for the on-glides. Where a syllable is made up
of a segment pronounced as a glide plus a vowel, the syllable is equivalent to
one with a consonant and a vowel, and the following pairs are rhythmically very
similar:
(56)ionim
bonimdeep sea
namemaua
mǝlǝfruit bat
crowdIn sequences of more than two vowels, no more than three belong to the same
syllable, but only one per syllable has full syllabic value:105TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOT

ant (sp.)

raintreeSyllable structure is the only respect in which these segments resemble consonants. In all other aspects, they behave as vowels, as we shall see. I will argue
that they are phonemically vowels, and that the glide qualities observed in some
contexts are sub-phonemic.
It was mentioned above that two identical vowels merge when adjacent, without
resulting in length (example (53)). The same is true of the segments under
consideration here, as shown in the following example with the class III verb ui, ‘see’:
(58)u-u-i
[wi]
see-3mS-stm2
‘he sees/saw’andu-i-i
[wi]
see-3fS-stm2
‘she sees/saw’Segments pronounced as glides further behave as vowels in terms of conditioning lenition. In the following example, the possessive (1st person possessor3rd person feminine possessee) tuŋ is pronounced with [r] following a “glide”
in poi ‘child’, and after a vowel, while after a consonant lenition is blocked
giving [t]:
(59)poi
tuŋ

tuŋ
knife(f) 1s.PossII.3f
‘my knife’[jeruŋ]naip
tuŋ
knife(f) 1s.PossII.3f
‘my knife’[najptuŋ]Similarly, a final /k/ is pronounced [ɣ] before a “glide” and a vowel alike, but
as [k] before a consonant:
(60)tǝtak iakur
little rope/vine
‘a little rope’[tǝtaɣ'jaɣʊr]tǝtak ikunǝm
little root
‘a little root’[tǝtaɣi'ɣʊnǝm]tǝtak kimuom

‘a little stick of firewood’Moreover, a sequence ending in /u/ in a closed syllable triggers labialisation
harmony in a following non-singular suffix just like it normally does (see further 3.3.4 below):

karipalpinia (ginger sp.)
wall
shell, shell scraper; carTo further investigate the nature of the vowel sequences, a speaker was asked to
pronounce some words very slowly. The results are somewhat ambiguous, but
do seem to establish two things. The first is that at least some sequences are not
diphthongs, since they can be split up, e.g.:
(62)
danuot
muabari
lǝilomcareful pron.
/da.nu.ot/
/mu.a.ba.ri/
/lǝ.i.lom/normal pron.
[danwot]
river
[mwabarɪ]
sun
[lɛjlɔm]
dolphinThe second result is that some of the closed syllables containing vowel sequences (CVVC) may indeed be regarded as single syllables rather than two
separate syllables (CV+VC), as they were often not split up, even when consisting of more than one morpheme:
(63)lakabuon
[lǝ.kǝ.bwon] stick of firewood
me-abu-am [mǝ.ja.bwam] 3pS-put-3pO – they put them
me-api-am [mǝ.ja.vjam] 3pS-carry-3pO – they carry/carried them(The process whereby a me-+a becomes [mǝja] is discussed in 3.3.3 below.) It
is possible that the number of syllables is also relevant here.
The pronunciations given in (55) were acceptable to speakers in slow tempo,
but I was told that for instance the adjective kukku- ‘angry’ with the third person
masculine suffix is properly [kʊ'kuɪ], rather than [kʊ'kuj] as it is heard in connected speech. This suggests that the process is less universal for off-glides.
Two adjacent vowels sometimes belong to different syllables, and if one of
them has the word stress they are produced separately (this will be represented
with a stop (.)), e.g.:
(64)pakku.o [pa'ku.ɔ]
fanu.o
[fa'nu.ɔ]
lǝle.uma [lǝ'le.uma]taro leaf
short side of house
termiteSome of the sequences of two vowels have particular associations with simple
vowels, e.g.:
(65)/ie/ – /i/
/ie/ – /e/
/ou/ – /o/
/au/ – /o/kier ~ kir
-lien ~ -len
kouma ~ koma

Processes applying to vowels
As stated above, two adjacent identical vowels merge without resulting in
length, as in (53). All other regular processes applying to vowels are morphophonological, that is, particular morphemes such as “subject prefix” or “nonsingular” are a necessary part of the specification of the conditions for the process to apply. For instance, the process whereby /a/ and a following /i/ merge to

allow for the process to apply; in the case of /u/ + /i/, there is variability among
the different subject prefixes, and in one case the /i/ of the stem appears unstable (as evidenced by the rule of /a/ + /i/ J [e]); examples will be presented in
the following.
For /u/ + /o/ J [u], for five out of eighteen verb stems beginning in /o/ in my
sample, the process does not take place, so that it does apply in the first stem
but not in the second of the following two pairs (with class II verbs on the first
line and class III verbs on the second line):

applies generally, so that the /u/ disappears in all person markers that have it

added to the stem; this is an obligatory ending (signalling number if non-third
person markers are present), obscuring the stem form. On surface form, there
are two groups of adjectives (apart from some irregular ones), those that end in
/i/ for masculine and /u/ for feminine, and those that end in /e/ for masculine
and /o/ for feminine, e.g.:
(77)[muri] he/it(m) is good
[muru] she/it(f) is good[ise]
[iso]it(m) is rotten
it(f) is rottenSince i and u are demonstrative forms for masculine and feminine respectively,
we can say that these are the basic forms of the endings, and that the [e] and [o]
of the second set are produced from an underlying stem that ends in /a/ (isa-) by
application of rules. We have already seen /a/ + /i/ J [e] in verb class II, and we
would have to add a rule /a/ + /u/ J [o] for the feminine form. Both /au/ and /o/
are variations found in other places too. But rather than an underlying stemfinal /a/ it has been decided to postulate an underlying /ǝ/ for adjectives like
isǝ-, because of the non-singular forms and nominalisations. For the words in
(77), they are:11 I do not have full paradigms for all stems, and there may be a few more where bu-deviates. For (75) information on second singular and and third sincular masculine is
missing.","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131]"
"153ing the vowel /u/; lenition then causes it to be pronounced [up]). There are
scattered examples of -pup non-singulars in other declensions but it is repeatedly attested in the ma declension, and especially among the nǝma subgroup. In
two cases a further syllable /la/ is added: irima – irilǝpup ‘Octomeles sumatrana
(tree sp., Tok Pisin ‘erima’)’, and piririma – piririp/piririlǝpup ‘pandanus
(sp.)’.
Further irregularities are a few words with unexpected vowels before the nonsingular ending:
(9)buruma
abuluma
uleuma/uleomaburǝp
abulǝp R
uleplaplap
fish (generic)
parrotfish (sp.)In the second word, abuluma, the non-singular used is that of abulǝ ‘school of
fish’, but I have no explanation for buruma. In uleuma/uleoma the vowel preceding ma is subtracted with ma before -p is added.
The only word in the declension not to subtract -ma before the non-singular is
added is the one feminine word, arǝma ‘pandanus fruit (sp.)’, which forms its
non-singular by simply adding -p (arǝmap). It is probably incidental that it ends
in ma.
The ma declension does not show any obvious semantic unity, although it may
be noted that it is particularly well represented among words denoting species
and parts of plants, insects, shells and fish, and is found also also among body
parts and in some words for male humans. The -nǝma subgroup is similar, but
also contains four fruit trees, where the corresponding fruits have related forms
ending in nǝm (see 5.2.8 below). Words of the ma declension are sometimes in
gender opposition with words of the bun declension for entities with natural
gender (see 5.2.4 below).
5.2.3
The na declension
There are 36 words in the na declension. They are predominantly masculine,
but three are feminine (girivǝna ‘snot’, pasina ‘pig snare’ and the homonyms
buna ‘green pigeon (sp.)’ and ‘fine black sand’); for two further words I have
received contradictory gender information (danmǝlina ‘lymph’ and burumuana
‘broken knife without a handle’). One more word, pǝsǝna ‘clansman; clanswoman’, takes either gender depending on the sex of the referent.5
As for the non-singular formation, most of these words subtract -na and then
add -p (20 words, plus two which also permit another pattern), for instance:5 I lack gender information for one word; for the two with contrasting information Iam inclined to trust the speaker who said they are masculine. Information on nonsingular forms is missing for two words.","[175, 176]"

Stress
Kuot stress is lexically determined, i.e., there are no general stress rules that
make reference to syllables or moras, but the position of stress has to be known
for each lexeme.13 Some endings frequently attract stress in combination with
lexical stems, but particular stems retain stress even when such an ending is
present.
Preliminary analysis yields the following generalization: Lexical stress in Kuot
is manifested chiefly through duration, but is not associated with pitch.14
Rather, pitch appears to be used mainly to signal information about the clause. I
will attempt to demonstrate this functional separation in the following, dealing
with the expression of lexical stress in this section and clause intonation in the
next (3.6).15
To investigate the variation between stressed and unstressed syllables, some
minimal and near-minimal stress pairs were recorded in controlled syntactic environments. A few of these will be illustrated here. They are given with raw
13 Ideally, stress should therefore be marked on all Kuot words given here. However,since the realisation of stress in Kuot is so different from that to which I was accustomed, it took me a long time to perceive stress correctly, and I am unwilling to trust
my notes in this respect for all vocabulary collected during all but the last few months
of fieldwork. It was therefore decided to omit stress marking altogether.
14 Another possible exponent of stress, namely greater approximation of the cardinalvalue for the syllabic vowel, is not unambiguously associated with stressed syllables in
Kuot.
15 Interpreting the phonetic correlates of the perceptual category of stress is a notori-ously controversial area (see for example Ladd (1996) for an introduction to the
intricacies of this field). Instrumental analysis has been carried out in order to support
and graphically illustrate the perceptual (auditory) analysis, and is not to be mistaken
for phonetic analysis (which is beyond the scope of this thesis).","[132, 133, 134]"
"142WORD CLASSES AND OVERVIEW OF MORPHOLOGY: MORPHOLOGY8. The action nominalisation process for verbs of classes II and III consists in
adding a suffix -(i)ap, but the subject slot must also be filled by the second person singular suffix (nu-). Most class II verbs can take this derivation.
9. The action nominalisation process for adjectives involves a suffix -(V)nim but
without subject marking (an example was given in the introduction to this section, under 4.2). The process is not fully productive and there is some irregularity.
10. Two items are listed under this number, separated by a broken line to indicate that they are not ordered with respect to one another. The future object
markers in verb class II are suffixes like the non-future ones (cf. 5. above), but
involve no phonological interaction with the stem. The object prefixes used in
verb class I and in the first and second person in classes II and III also do not interact with stems, but are constant in form.
11. Last among the affixes, we have the dual suffix -ien. It is added onto the
non-singular form of nouns, e.g.:
(3)maua-p-ien
‘two fruitbats’
fruit.bat-nsg-dlThe suffix itself is very regular, but in some cases the form to which it is added
is not the non-singular form normally used. The dual suffix is optional in the
sense that inanimates are usually not marked for dual, but is well integrated
with the word in that pausing never occurs before it.
The forms looked at so far are analysed as affixes on account of forming tight
units with the stems to which they adhere, and occurring with words of particular word classes (or sub-classes). We will now turn to forms analysed as clitics,
although the first one is somewhat intermediary between clitic and affix status.
12. The subject markers of verb class I are treated as clitics in this work, but deviate from the definition of clitics given above; while all other morphemes
identified as clitics have a distribution that makes reference to position within
the phrase, the subject markers of verb class I always attach to verb stems of
class I, being in that respect affix-like. The class I subject markers form a unit
with the verb stem, to which one of the other clitics can then attach, forming a
sequence of two units, as in (4), while the other clitics are mutually exclusive:
(4)U-tie,
3f-therepare=meŋ=arǝ
get.up=3pS=ASPmakaulǝp
woman.nsgga o-kima=meŋ=arǝ [u-sik
sǝgǝr]…
and 3fO-see=3pS=ASP 3f-DEM egg(f)
‘Alright, the women got up and saw this egg…’These subject markers are treated as clitics because of their low level of cohesion with the stem, as compared to the affixes. They show minimal phonological interaction with the verb stem; there are contexts where the slot is not obligatorily filled; and speakers frequently pause before the subject marker in dictating, and often separate it by a space when writing. It is clear that they are in143TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTtermediate between clitics and affixes in terms of Kuot morphological categories.
13. The next item is the first representative of the proper clitics, the aspect
marker =rǝ. It cliticises to the first constituent of the phrase (normally the verb
phrase).3 Only one clitic can go in this position, so =rǝ is in complementary
distribution with items 14. and 15. on the list, which are thus all mutually exclusive. As for all clitics with this distribution, the continuous aspect particle mǝn
is not counted when determining which is the first constituent. =rǝ shows some
phonological interaction with its host, in that it takes the form =arǝ following a
consonant. After a vowel, both =rǝ and =r are possible. It is presented separate
from the following clitics because it is different semantically: while the adverbial clitics in 14. and 15. have fairly distinct meanings, =rǝ is quite bleached
and its meaning depends largely on context.
14. The adverbial enclitics =it ‘just’ and several ones meaning ‘a little’ (slightly
different in form) also cliticise to the first constituent in the phrase to which
they belong. They interact with the phonological shape of their hosts in that the
initial vowel of the clitic is dropped if the host ends in a vowel, giving =t, =rom
etc. The meanings of these clitics and of those in 15. could be said to be lexical
rather than grammatical in character; i.e., their semantics is largely isolable and
corresponds to senses expressed by adverbs and similar words in most languages, and their use is determined by their semantics rather than grammatical
considerations such as tense or person.
15. This set of adverbial clitics share their distribution (and mutual exclusivity)
with the items given in 13. and 14. They differ from the latter in that they are
invariant forms, having no phonological interaction with their hosts (other than
general phonological process such as k→ɣ / V_V which apply everywhere in
the language when the conditions arise). Although the distribution is certainly
that of clitics, the fact that the forms are invariant makes this set similar to particles.
16. A diverse group of forms is given here, separated by dotted lines to indicate
that they are not ordered with respect to each other. They are all analysed as
particles here, because they are invariant forms, and their distribution is determined by syntactic rules applying on a phrase level but to each specifically,
with reference to particular other constituents (rather than simply the number of
constituents as for the majority of clitics). Onim (sometimes anim) indicates
origin in terms of place or time. Non ‘some’ and ba “one” belong to the noun
phrase and are to do with specificity. Nǝmo has a variety of functions and can
be an auxiliary or function as a complementiser. Buat marks habitual and is an
auxiliary in the verb phrase, synonymous with the auxiliary verb -me; it is further homonymous with the prohibitive particle; see 18. below). E/eba/ba marks3 This is reminiscent of the so called Wackernagel position, but in Kuot applies to thephrase rather than the clause.","[164, 165, 166]"

stage when many parts of the grammar already had much the form we see today: pronominal forms and locatives were established, and verb class II closed
but class III and adjectives still open (although the latter are both closed today).
Swadesh’s 100-word basic vocabulary list for Kuot gives nine words with /s/
(five nouns, three verbs of class I and one numeral), and one word with /f/
(noun).
It may also be mentioned that neither /s/ nor /f/ is voiced in intervocalic position, unlike the voiceless stops (which are the only other voiceless consonants
in the language), and in contrast to /s/ and /f/ in neighbouring languages.
3.2.4
The roles of consonants in the grammar
Some of the consonants of Kuot, while appearing in many kinds of words, also
have particular associations. Thus /t/ is common in the paradigm of locatives
and directionals (from which demonstratives are also formed); and bilabials are
associated with plural – /p/ for non-singular on nouns, and /m/ for third person
plural verb agreement and adjective suffixes. /b/ signals non-singular inclusive
in the cross-referencing morphology. Both /n/ and /l/ stand for dual on nouns
and in verbal and adjectival cross-referencing, and /ŋ/ is part of the third person
singular marking in cross-referencing (in other cases marked by vowels) and
possessor marking. Of the remaining phonemes, /k/, /d/, /g/ and /r/ do not have
systematic associations of this kind, and /s/ and /f/ do not participate in grammatical morphology.

Kuot is a non-Austronesian (Papuan) language spoken by some 1,500 people in
north-central New Ireland, Papua New Guinea. It is the only non-Austronesian
language in New Ireland Province, but is structurally quite different both from
its Austronesian neighbours and from non-Austronesian languages in other areas of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It is spoken in many situations of daily life, but is losing ground to the English-based creole Tok Pisin, in
which all Kuot speakers are fluent. Sadly, Kuot is for the most part not being
transmitted to children, and is likely to disappear within the next few decades.
At the time when white people first arrived in the region, there were Kuot
speakers on the west coast of New Ireland and in the mountains, but not on the
east coast. After the establishment of a German government post in Nusa in
1900 (later moved to the site of the present provincial capital, Kavieng), warfare
ceased and roads were built along the coasts. In the following decades, the
inland population gradually moved to the coasts, either taking up residence in
existing villages or establishing new ones. Today, there are Kuot villages on
both coasts but none in the mountains.
The analyses presented in this work are based on original data collected during
some 18 months of fieldwork in Papua New Guinea between 1997 and 2000.
Most of this time was spent in Bimun village on the west coast of New Ireland,
in the south of the Kuot-speaking area.
The present volume covers the following topics. This chapter provides a grammatical overview and discusses Kuot as a linguistic type, names used for Kuot
in previous sources, and data and the fieldwork situation. Chapter 2 gives sociocultural information about the Kuot speakers, in terms of prehistory, history,
ethnography, kinship and beliefs, and also discusses dialects and the prognosis
of survival of Kuot. Phonology is the subject of Chapter 3. The criteria for word
class membership are set out in Chapter 4, which also contains a discussion of
the difficulties involved in defining morpheme types. Chapter 5 deals with
nouns.1
1.1
Grammatical overview
This section provides a summary of some of the main features of Kuot grammar
with particular attention to areas not treated in separate chapters in this dissertation. A brief discussion of Kuot from a typological point of view is also given.","[18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"
"165guages in the region), and that the endings were once classifier morphemes.
Another possibility is that the ending may at one time have been a meaningful
lexical item and the construction initially something like a compound word (not
presently a word formation strategy in Kuot). The compound scenario would
account for the gender association of declensions, if the gender of the compound word came from the last part, the present-day ending. This would also
account for the semantic unity that we see in some declensions: if for example
there was a feminine noun bu (or an earlier related form) which meant fruitbearing tree, and trees started being called ‘x fruit tree’ instead of just ‘x’, this
would account quite nicely for the bu declension we see today.
One problem with these ideas is that there are exceptions in all cases, and some
declensions have no discernible semantic unity at all. As Kuot is a genetic isolate, there is no comparative data against which to judge semantic drift, that is,
there is no external data to help us determine whether non-typical words in
some of the declensions originally meant something else, or to support the notion that some words may have the declension-defining ending coincidentally,
or indeed to verify a hypothesised origin for the ending.
5.3
Other non-singular patterns
A few words form non-singular on other patterns; some more are irregular, and
there is a small amount of suppletion.
5.3.1
-bip, -iap and other smaller non-singular patterns
Some types of alternative non-singular formation cut across declensions. In
particular, there is a group of 20 words that take a plural ending in -bip. The
-bip ending is sometimes added to the full singular form; in other cases part of
the singular stem is subtracted. For several words, other non-singular forms also
exist. The words taking the bip non-singular are given here with gender and declension information (“p” stands for the plain declension):

headBoth of the irregular duals are formed on what would have been a regular nonsingular; for labun the non-singular is suppletive (or at least involves rather farreaching changes to the stem) while the dual goes back to the singular form. For
parabunǝm, one informant also gave a dual form parabunǝmupien.
Some words get an ending with the form -bip through other mechanisms, and
should not be included here. This concerns words whose singular form includes
/b/, to which -ip is added after subtraction of the original ending; they are karebima – karebip ‘piece of sweet potato cooked in coconut milk’, pakkubinǝm –
pakkubip ‘intestine’, obinǝm – obip ‘canoe’, mobinǝm – mobip ‘lip’. A couple
of words which have no singular form also end in -bip: tubiebip ‘coastal people’
and burabip ‘old garden’. Since their relation to the singular form is not known,
it cannot be determined whether they are bona fide bip non-singulars. 18
Another, albeit less common, form of non-singular marking is -iap. It is found
with many time words (including recently borrowed names for weekdays), as
well as with some ordinary nouns:

triviaA further possible member is inǝmǝniap ‘people’. This word has no singular
form, but appears to be related to inǝmon ‘world’ and to neighbouring Nochi
inaman ‘people’. There is a tendency for stems which can also be used as class I18 It may be suggested that the bip forms consist of the regular non-singular -ip with a/b/ that may formerly have been part of the singular form. However, there are two reasons why this seems unlikely. First, voiced stops are not permitted as final segments
(cf. 3.2.1), and nor are there any corresponding *gip or *dip endings to suggest that
they once were; second, the vowel of the non-singular would be expected to be [u] after /b/ as after all other final bilabials but we find only bip, and there are also no*bup
forms conditioned by rounded vowels (as should be the case for e.g. uppau and unbun).","[187, 188, 189]"
"49TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOT2.6.4
Kin-based prescribed behaviour
As set out above, Kuot society is non-hierarchical in structure, but that does not
mean that there are no rules specifying different types of social interaction with
different people; there are, and they are mostly defined by kinship.
Kuot kin relationships can be divided into three main categories, avoidance
relationships, close and unrestrained relationships, and joking relationships. The system obviously deviates from those described in the standard anthropological literature on the matter, where avoidance relationships are usually
contrasted with joking relationships, but without a third category explicitly described.
The strongest avoidance relations obtain between siblings of different sex, between cross-cousins of different sex, between a man and his mother-in-law, and
between a woman and her husband’s maternal uncle. Close relations are the
most clearly observed between siblings of the same sex, and also between e.g. a
mother and her daughter. The joking relationship is found in two relations: that
between a male child and his father’s sister (nabar) and that between crosscousins of the same sex.
The types of relationships are expressed (or not expressed) in terms of behaviour such as pronouncing the name of a person, sitting (etc.) close to a person,
joking with a person, touching a person’s skin and hair, and in some cases restrictions to do with a person’s property (house, clothes). Each type of relation
will be characterised here, followed by a description of one of the most salient
aspects of these relations, the name taboo.
Close relations are very relaxed. Children enjoy close relations with everyone
for quite a number of years, and taboos and restrictions are only gradually introduced and appear not to be enforced until puberty. Close relations are same-sex
sibling relations, parent – child relations, grandparent – grandchild relations and
husband – wife relations; also, in the Bimun area, ego’s spouse’s same-sex sibling. When interacting, these people use each other’s names; they may sit, stand
or lie much as they wish (and even fall asleep on the floor when visiting each
other); they may touch each other (only within close relations will you see one
looking for lice in the other’s hair) and look into each other’s eyes; they may
joke with each other and speak freely on any topic; and they may share pieces
of food or eat off the same plate, share betel nuts, take things from the other’s
basket, etc. They may not deny the other anything asked of them (and often an
item can be seen moving through the community along these lines, for instance
a new cap or string bag). These interactions can be restricted if someone is
nearby whose presence demands more decorous behaviour (see below).
Avoidance relations are talked about in terms of respect by speakers (the Kuot
term for showing respect in this way is the class I verb gogo34). In contrast to34 This word may be a loan, as it is mentioned by Parkinson (1999 [1907]: 121); therehowever it is given as the word for the pandanus hood that married New Ireland50KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: KINSHIPthe close relations just described, in e.g. a brother – sister relationship the two
may not use each other’s names, touch skin or hair or pass close enough to
smell each other, they should not talk together unless necessary and must never
mention anything to do with sex in each other’s presence (even directed at
someone else). A woman can give her brother food but they may never share
the same pieces or eat off the same plate, nor share the same piece of betel nut
or betel pepper. A man may not touch his sister’s clothes and must not pass under the line where she dries her washing, or indeed under anything of hers, such
as her house. This part is not reciprocal; a woman can wash her brother’s
clothes and can pass under things belonging to him, but may not go onto his
house, nor sit on anything he has built, such as a bench. This restriction recurs
for a man’s mother-in-law, female cross-cousin and mother’s brother’s wife,
and it was often said in this connection that the man would have cut the wood in
the forest and carried it on his shoulders.35 A secondary reason (so ranked by
my informant on the topic) is that the man who built the house may want to
walk under it. The restrictions on houses and benches (etc.) can be temporarily
removed if the woman pays a little bit of money (ranging from perhaps 20 toea
to a few kina), for instance if a woman is caught out by rain on her way home or
for any other reason wants to use the house or, more commonly, the bench. It
can also be permanently eliminated ritually if for instance a man wants to “clear
the way” for his sister to go onto a house that he has built or use a bench: he
will put on a feast, she will also pay some money, and a clan leader will make
an announcement.
In the case of a man and his mother-in-law, which is the strongest taboo of all
for a married man, they are not supposed to have any contact. A man does not
enter a house where his mother-in-law is and vice versa. In a roundabout way
they can sometimes take part in the same conversation, for example if some
people are in a house and some sitting outside, both the son-in-law and the
mother-in-law may contribute to the conversation in a general way but never
address each other. A son-in-law is expected not to be loud or make any crude
comments in her presence, nor to laugh. If she is outside, he should spend as
little time as possible in her field of vision, and she equally avoids him in these
ways. As mentioned, the mother-in-law is not to go up into a house or sit on a
bench that her son-in-law has built.
A cooking house is exempt from the house taboo (possibly because it is not on
posts but directly on the ground), so the older woman is able to work with her
daughter in her daughter’s kitchen even if the daughter’s husband has built it.36
women used to wear in the presence of married men. The hood is no longer used, but
is known in Tok Pisin as ‘karuka’ (Kuot kapǝt).
The exact significance of this expression is not quite clear. I attempted the
reformulation that he had built it with his strength; this however was neither refuted
nor particularly enthusiastically received.
3536 The taboos to do with going onto houses is interesting as all available evidence indi-cates that houses were built directly on the ground in former times. It seems that the51TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTThe strongest taboo for a married woman in Bimun is that concerning her husband’s mother’s brother (his tata).37 She may not go into a house where he is,
and is expected to stay away from him for example in a crowd at a feast. She
will not go into a house or onto the veranda of a house that the uncle has built.
The same relation applies to the wife of the uncle vis-a-vis his sister’s son; since
the two men are in an uncle – nephew relationship, the wife of each has to show
respect for her husband’s maternal uncle/sister’s son in this way. (Two women
married to men in a tata relationship, however, have a close relation and can
call each other sister, or louaga.)
Other relations, although characterised as respect relations, only show some of
the features associated with the strongest avoidance relations. Thus a woman
can sit down near her brother’s wife (nemula) and talk with her, but may not
joke, or touch her hair and skin. She is not supposed to go onto the house because of her brother, but there is also the consideration that the brother’s wife
might like to go under the house. This particular relationship is not fully reciprocal, in that the man’s sister can use the name of his wife, and tell her to get
things etc., but not vice versa.
There are two relationships defined by joking, kokup ‘same-sex cross-cousin’
and nabar ‘father’s sister’. With the first, it is not ordinary kidding, but teasing
and playing tricks sometimes bordering on the nasty. The victim is not allowed
to be upset. Teasing is often rude, and definitely respectless (like when one
woman talked to her cross-cousin about a mat the latter had made which was
not very straight: “This mat is like you, little on top [meaning the head] and big
down below [meaning the behind]”). A kokup will sometimes steal his kokup’s
copra, representing quite a lot of work, and sell it in town for his own benefit,
and there is nothing the wronged party can do (except steal something else another time).
With nabar, the joking is sexual, in particular of course if the nephew is male.
The jokes centre around the idea that the aunt and the nephew are married. The
boy calls her husband luop, the term used for men who have married into the
same matriline as ego. When the boy grows up and is married, his nabar and his
wife will call each other louaga, the term for a woman who has married a close
male relative of ego’s husband, and they will joke that they are both married to
him. The boy’s nabar gives him food, and there appears to have been a whole
house taboo is essentially an extension of the bench (etc.) taboo, and that the aspect of
walking under/over the other has been added to that. There is not otherwise any emphasis on relative position in the vertical dimension. When I tried to look into that aspect by asking some women about it, the only result was the information that it is not
considered seemly for a woman to climb betel palms when here brother is nearby. The
explanation was volunteered that he might see under her laplap.
37 I am told this is different moving north within the Kuot area even only as far asPatlangat, where it would be a close relationship, allowing for jokes, and the two calling each other eia (grand-relation). The Bimun custom appears to be shared with the
Madak to the south.","[71, 72, 73, 74]"

for pagaribam, where all of -bam is subtracted and only -p added; kiribam
which is kiribǝlǝp rather than *kiribǝp, and kuriribam. The latter has been given
to me in several versions both in the singular (e.g. kudiriram, kudiram, kudiribam; some of which would not be in the bam declension) and non-singular, and
they do not always match; in other words, it is quite likely that another speaker
may form *kuriribǝp from the singular form given in (17) – there is little point
in dwelling on the relations between the singular and non-singular for this word,
other than to note that both are variable.
The source for the ending -bam may be the word bǝbam ‘leaf’ which in itself
looks like a reduplicated form of bam. It is notable that several words in this
declension denote various types of leaves (and ‘paddle’ may perhaps be considered leaf-like), and that several others are typically part of pluralities (such as
‘fish scales’ and ‘coconut fibres’ (both also leafy)). I aware of related stems for
only three words. They are opǝlǝbam ‘breadfruit leaf’ which is related to
opǝliobu ‘breadfruit tree’ (see 5.2.5 above), and kofibam, which is related to another type of flute called kofi – the latter was made from several pieces of
bamboo (like a pan flute), while the kofibam was a flute from a single piece of
bamboo. Atlubam ‘smooth-tailed trevally’ is related to atluma, which signifies a
school of atlubam.

and most involve subtracting -nǝm and adding either, -lup, -lǝp (/-lap) or just -p;
others simply add the non-singular suffix to the full singular form, e.g.:

there are also unique patterns (e.g. burunǝm – bureip ‘water, water bottles’).
Six of the words end in munǝm rather than just nǝm. Munǝm in itself means
‘kidney’ and may be the source of the ending for several of the words in this declension. We may also point to nǝnǝm ‘mouth’ as a possibility, parallel in form
to bǝbam in the bam declension. However, the semantics of the words in this9 I have no gender information for four words; two others were given as masculine butlater corrected. Two words lack non-singular information.","[180, 181]"
"5TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTParts of the verbal system show a future vs. non-future distinction (see also
1.1.8.3 below). Some stems in verb classes II and III have stem alternations and
/ or stress shift for future; subject markers in the first and second person singular and third masculine singular change their vowel from /u/ to /a/; and the subject suffixes of verb class IIa also have different forms for future. Some forms
may thus be severally marked, while others are not marked at all, depending on
the particular combination of stem and affixes.
One of four non-pronominal prefixes can replace object prefixes in the pre-verbal slot, causing the verb to be syntactically intransitive. They are te- ‘reflexive’, ne- ‘reciprocal’, u- ‘dummy object’ and da- ‘pluractional’. Reflexive is
exemplified in (4) with class IIa -bulǝ ‘cut’ and reciprocal in (5) with IIa
-nǝm(u) ‘kill, injure’:
(4)te-u-bulǝ
refl-3mS-cut
‘he cut himself’(5)ne-me-nǝm
rec-3pS-kill/injure
‘they killed each other’The reflexive has an interesting use as an impersonal form (which may be regarded as an incipient passive). This is available with future reference only, so
that saying that ‘the clothes will wash themselves’ means that the clothes are to
be washed, sometimes with an implication that someone present ought to do
something about it. There is no possibility of adding an agent phrase. In the
non-future, third person plural is used in impersonal senses: e.g., ‘they carried
me’ translates as ‘I was born’.
The ‘dummy object’ u- is thus called because it fills the preverbal object slot of
a transitive stem when it is used in an intransitive construction. The stem is still
semantically transitive, but is rendered syntactically intransitive in a particular
instance of use. As mentioned above, u- is used in the nominalisation of transitive stems. It is also used when a non-specific object is expressed as an oblique,
marked by an inalienable possessive (PossI) rather than cross-referenced. This
is shown in (6) a., contrasted with b. which has the full core argument crossreferencing (cf. 1.1.8 below on core vs. oblique arguments):
(6)a. me-la=r
mǝn u-pit=meŋ

b. me-la ma-pit=meŋ
lǝp
3pS-go 3pO-cut.firewood=3pS firewood.nsg
‘they went (and) cut (the) firewood’The ‘pluractional’ da- is somewhat less common. It indicates plurality associated with the action in some way. For instance, of a dog that bites a lot (7) can
be used, and we also find it in the occasional nominalisation, such as the one in
(8), which is based on -nǝm(u) ‘kill, injure’:6INTRODUCTION: GRAMMATICAL OVERVIEW

3m-DEMkapuna]
dog(m)1.1.2.2 The verb phrase
In the verb phrase, only the head is obligatory. Other elements as applicable occur in the following order: the first element is the periphrastic future marker
e(ba), followed by auxiliary verbs or particles, then serial verbs and last the
head.
Auxiliaries encode mood and aspect senses such as habitual (particle buat, verb
class II -me) and ‘want; be about to’ (particle nǝmo and verb class II -ga), while
serial verbs are limited to ‘go’ and ‘come’ (-la ‘go’, mu-o and -op ‘come’).
There is further a particle mǝn giving continuous (progressive) aspect which can
occur either before or after auxiliaries and serial verbs and appears to be fairly
new to the system. We also find an aspect enclitic =rǝ (/=arǝ/=r) which attaches to the first constituent of the phrase (unless that constituent is mǝn, in
which case it attaches to the following constituent). The functions of this aspect
marker include perfect-like and completive-like uses, but it is difficult to characterise fully and to label, as it has weak semantics and interacts with predicate
semantics. It is therefore simply glossed as ‘ASPect’ here. (The same slot is used
by adverbial enclitics; cf. 1.1.6 below.)
The only syntactic difference between verbs and adjectives is that future is
marked periphrastically twice for adjectives, with e(ba) as for verbs, and with
an additional ba following the head. In this, adjectives are like other non-verbal
predicates.
Non-verbal predicates can be of a variety of word classes, and only a couple
will be illustrated here. Among nouns, some take class I verbal morphology
when used as predicates, and a handful take the same first and second person
marking as adjectives. The majority, however, are not morphologically marked
for predicate function. Aspect and tense marking function as in other predicate
phrases. Future marking has the extra ba after the head. The following example
illustrates a noun phrase (consisting of a single noun) in predicate function with
future marking:
(9)Eba afǝrǝt ba.
FUT rain
FUT2
‘(there) will be rain.’1.1.3
Possessives
There are two full sets of possessive markers indexing possessor for all 12 person/number/gender categories. The first, PossI, is for inalienable possession,
which in Kuot entails body parts and all other part–whole relations (but not
kin). PossI also has a variety of other functions, marking e.g. material and instrument and a general associative (much like compounds in Germanic lan-7TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTguages), as well as some types of oblique objects. The same set of forms has
grammaticalised as object prefixes on verbs.
The alienable possessives (PossII) index both possessor and possessee (only
third person referents can be possessed). PossII is used for alienable ownership
and kin, and also has some benefactive uses. These forms are of more recent
origin than PossI, and appear to have been formed from the latter plus other
person-marking material present in the language. The PossII set is most likely
the source of the subject enclitics of verb class I.
PossI and PossII employ the same construction:
POSSESSEE MARKER POSSESSORSince the markers index possessor, they can also be used as possessive pronouns (giving the structure POSSESSEE MARKER), and this is the default for first
and second person. The choice between PossI and PossII is semantic, in the
sense that the same noun can take either coding depending on whether it is a
part of something or alienably possessed, in a given instance:
(10)pupu a
meat 3m.PossI
‘pork’kumurot
pig(m)(11)pupu aŋ
Abraham
meat 3m.PossII.s A.
‘Abraham’s (piece of) meat’There are also special interrogative forms (‘whose’), agreeing with the possessed in number and gender. No nouns are obligatorily possessed.5 The forms are
given in Appendix I.
1.1.4
Prepositions
Kuot has ten prepositions. Two have no indexing affixes and differ syntactically
from the rest: ga ‘and’, which can be used in the sense ‘with’, and onim which
indicates origin in space or time. The rest index a following noun by affixes expressing number, gender and person; some do so obligatorily, others optionally.
If the referent is pronominal, it is expressed as an affix:
(12)to-buo
1s-on
‘on me’*bo turuo
on 1sIf a nominal following a preposition is relativised, the preposition is always indexed for that nominal (unless it is ga or onim), here dram (f):
5 An alienable – inalienable distinction in possessives is associated with Austronesian-speaking areas of Papua New Guinea, and it is possible that Kuot has been influenced
by contact in this respect. However, the distinction in neighbouring languages is quite
different: in Nalik and Madak, inalienable possession encodes both kin and body parts,
and at least some inalienably possessed nouns appear to be obligatorily possessed. The
structure of the morphological expression of the two categories is also different in
those languages.","[26, 27, 28, 29]"

accent) thus involves expanding the phonotactics rather than the phoneme inventory.19
A few words from Tok Pisin appear to have entered Kuot via other languages in
the area with phonologies different from that of Kuot. One is naf, Tok Pisin
‘inap’, English ‘enough’, from Nalik which often has /f/ for /p/, and uses naaf in
this sense (Volker 1998: 32); this form is used in northern Kuot which borders
on the Nalik-speaking area (while an indigenous stem puo is used in southern
Kuot). Another is [teon] for ‘table’ (Tok Pisin ‘tebol’); I am unaware of its
path, but it could have entered New Ireland Tok Pisin through a language that
has a [b] ~ [v] alternation, such as Lavongai (Stamm 1988) (presumably final [l]
J [n] is the Kuot alternation seen above in 3.2.2.4).
Due to English being the language of instruction from grade three in schools,
some English words make their way straight into Kuot, and younger speakers
have no trouble with clusters such as the initial ones in ‘clay’ and ‘string’. Some
English phones also have deviant pronunciation in some words; in particular [z]
J [dʒ] (so that ‘New Zealand’ is pronounced [nju dʒilan]). It is not clear to me
whether this is a matter of “hyperadaption” on the level of individual speakers,
or whether it is more widespread and perhaps even taught in schools.
3.10
Areal phonology
Several of the features typical of Kuot phonology are shared with the languages
to the north (Nalik, Kara), south (Lamasong, Madak, Barok) and, to a lesser
extent, east (Nochi) of Kuot. The features concerned are: the lenition of voiceless stops in intervocalic position; the non-occurrence of voiced stops in final
position; final [l] to [n]; and a weak (partial) phonological opposition between19 Eklund & Lindström (1998) introduced the term “xenophone” to cover what hasbeen variously known as “loan phonemes”, “foreign sounds” or “anomalous segments” (cf. Eklund & Lindström 2001: 82-87). The term covers items such as [tʃ]/
[ts]/[s] for English /tʃ/ when used in Kuot; [tʃ] and [ts] are not part of the phonology of
Kuot, but occur in a restricted set of loan words, foreign proper names etc., and would
constitute an extension of the phone set of Kuot itself. As the majority of recently borrowed words in Kuot do not result in an expanded phone set but rather in expanded
positional possibilities for existing speech sounds, we may perhaps speak of “xenophonotactics” here.","[148, 149]"
"180NOUNS: GENDERmost common where the agreement (or indexing or cross-reference) marker
comes before the noun, meaning that the speaker may have had another noun in
mind, as in the following, where the verb with the faulty object cross-referencer
is followed by some hesitation:

3fO-make.fire=3mS=ASP
‘He lit the <...> frond’<pi- marǝ>
pirit
whatsit(m) dry.coconut.frond(m)Here it is also the case that the verb used is one that is almost always used with
kit ‘fire’ which is feminine, and it is not quite appropriate in the context according to the speaker who helped me transcribe it.
While production mistakes are not infrequent, they are almost universally corrected when a text is transcribed. For the issue of gender consistency it is also
interesting to note that the filler words marǝ and maro (see above) almost always match the gender of the sought-for noun.
5.6.2.1 Speaker awareness of gender variability
Most speakers do not show a high level of awareness of variability, even when
it comes to loan words, which are the most variable. For instance, there is the
Tok Pisin loan ‘bilum’, meaning the net or string bag common on New Guinea,
but not traditional in New Ireland, though now widely used. Some speakers
treat this word as masculine, others as feminine. Several times I was corrected
on this point, sometimes faulted for using masculine, other times for using
feminine. There are two interesting points about this; first that many speakers
have apparently not noticed the variation among fellow native speakers, since if
they had they presumably would not correct a learner; and secondly it illustrates
the principle that a word can only have one gender for most speakers. For most
speakers, the most common attitude when presented with an instance of use of a
word with different gender from what they would themselves use, is that the
other usage is simply wrong. A few speakers (notably my main informant,
Robert Sipa) had made the observation that some words vary between speakers,
and could even formulate relevant generalisations for particular words, such as
the generational or geographic distribution of its gender variability.
5.6.3
The semantics of gender
Three groups of nouns can be distinguished with regard to gender assignment in
Kuot (this is expressed also in Figure 2 above):
• nouns referring to humans and higher animates follow the sex of the
referent (natural gender)
• nouns in the special declensions where nine of ten declensions have a
gender association, as do nominalisations (morphological assignment)
• the rest (no rules: opaque gender assignment)
The special declensions were given in full or exemplified in 5.2 above, with
their gender distributions. It was seen that all of the special declensions except
the n declension are associated with a particular gender (the association being a181TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTlittle weaker for the na and m declensions). This subsection is concerned with
words in the plain and n declensions, looking first at words whose grammatical
gender follow the sex of the referent, and then at the rest of the vocabulary. It
will be seen that very little can be concluded in terms of semantic underpinnings for nouns which do not receive gender through morphology (as in the
special declensions, and to an extent nominalisations), or through the sex of the
referent.
5.6.3.1 Humans and higher animates
Words denoting humans or relations of either gender almost always take the
gender of the referent (some were given in (52)), and this occasionally overrules
the gender associations of special declensions, such as bunima ‘lastborn’ of the
ma declension and kanakanotobu ‘sorcerer’ of the bu declension. In the case of
kǝsǝŋanima ‘twin’ speakers agreed that this word is masculine (possibly because of being in the ma declension) but no one asked could think what a female twin was called. Some words are of course only applicable to persons of a
particular gender, such as unuli ‘traditional doctor; one who does war magic’, a
function that can only be performed by a man.
For animals there are separate nouns for males and females, primarily for domesticated animals:
(55)kapuna dog, male dog
kumurot pig, boar
pura
fowl, roosterlaibun
kumebun
puraibunbitch
sow
hen(All the female terms are in the bun declension.)
For possums, although they live in the wild, there are separate terms for male
and female as well as a generic term:
(56)gǝs
m possum, generic
buraba
m male possum
mukusebun f female possumThere are also male and female terms for ‘rat, mouse’, given in 5.2.4. Rodents
are not normally differentiated for sex by speakers, being usually referred to
with the masculine term (kifǝma) – the explanation for the feminine form is that
parents sometimes affectionately call small children ‘little rat’, and the feminine
form is used to female children. The presence of the gender-differentiated forms
for ‘rat’ thus does not constitute a violation of the animacy hierarchy. The hierarchy would lead us to expect more differentiation for animals which are salient
to humans, normally big animals, domesticated animals, or animals with which
humans interact in particular ways, especially those where the sex of the animal
determines the nature of the interaction. Rodents do not exactly fulfil these
criteria, but the fact that the difference in gender is adhered to when the terms
are applied to humans neatly illustrates the relevance of the animacy hierarchy
for gender-differentiated nouns in Kuot.
There are not many major mammals or big birds and fishes in New Ireland, and
the words for some are found in the special declensions and thus not relevant
here (e.g. ‘shark’, ‘old possum’, ‘big lizard’). The few remaining words have
182NOUNS: GENDERonly grammatical gender and do not take into account the sex of the animal,
showing them as lower on an animacy hierarchy than humans, domesticates and
possums, for instance:
(57)arigariga
kotarau
leilomm wallaby (generic)
m wallaby (young)
f dolphinTo specify the sex of a wallaby or shark for example, the attribute construction
is used (cf. 1.1.1).
In narratives, animals sometimes have roles which conflict with the grammatical gender. The grammatical gender usually prevails; for instance in (58) where
an egg has been laid by a python – lǝmot python is masculine:
(58)…o-i-op
[u-sik

RELR 3mS-put-3fO
‘…she found this egg of this python (who) had laid it.’Mixed-gender collectives are referred to using the non-singular of the word for
the male, e.g.:
(59)ira-p-ien
kumep
kapunǝpparents
pigs; boars
dogs; male dogs(= father-nsg-dl)
(sows is kumeulǝp)
(bitches is laibunup)5.6.3.2 Inanimates and lower animates in the plain and n declensions
It has not been possible to find a convincing principle or set of principles to account for the gender distribution of the part of the vocabulary which does not
receive gender through morphological assignment or sex, although there are a
few weak tendencies. Several cross-linguistically attested principles underlying
gender or noun class systems in the languages of the world were pursued and
will be reported here. I looked at parameters such as shape and size, and categories like fruits, liquids, sharp instruments, fire, substances, time words, abstract
nouns, nominalisations, and artefacts and culturally or ritually important items.
A problem with the semantic investigation is that such a large proportion of the
nouns receive gender through membership in the special declensions. This
means that many of the central members of any suggested semantic category are
already “taken”, since many of the nouns denoting any class of items will be in
the special declensions and therefore excluded from semantic consideration.
This in turn means that the remaining nouns will be fewer in number, and
sometimes not very central to the category in question, making the results difficult to interpret.
The parameter of shape, typically long vs. round, is exploited for gender in
many Papuan languages (cf. Foley 1986: 77–91, Terrill 1999: 127). To investigate it in Kuot, we may look at words first for long things, especially sticks and
stick-like objects, and then for round things:183TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOT

fOf the words for long things, six out of ten are masculine, which is not a convincing majority.
For round things, the numbers are clearer, with 15 feminine to three masculine
nouns, but some caution is advisable. It may appear from the list that round
things have a tendency to be feminine. However, it is also clear that there are
many words pertaining to betelnuts and to coconuts and three for breadfruits,
and it could be that it is these particular items that condition the gender (although all three masculine words in the group also denote betelnuts). If we were
to go by item, so that each type of fruit counts as one, the list would have only
seven units. Six of these would be feminine and one ambi-gendered. This indicates that there may still be a semantic parameter at work here, although it is
hard to say whether it concerns roundness or fruits/nuts.
Turning to look at fruits more generally, we find that many are masculine; they
were not given in (61) since they are less round in shape:184NOUNS: GENDER

cucumberInsofar as there is a shape parameter, it would appear, then, that it applies only
to fruits.
Another interesting point in this semantic area is that there would seem to be a
tendency for one type of item to have one gender, that is, it seems that coconuts
are feminine regardless of the word used, and yams similarly are masculine. Betelnuts, on the other hand, go against this generalisation, and it is not a principle
otherwise salient in the language.
If shape has indeed been a factor in the gender assignment of fruits, this principle has been lost. Looking at recent loan words for fruits, we see that the principle of round fruits being feminine and longish fruits masculine is not followed:

so are conspicuously round fruits like melons and guavas.
Note that there is no gender opposition between fruits and trees in the plain declension. Most fruit trees and many fruits are in the special declensions, where
there is a degree of opposition along these lines, but for example nur ‘coconut
palm’ is feminine as are most words to do with coconuts.
Size is another parameter sometimes exploited in gender systems (often in conjunction with shape). There are a few words in the data for things conceived of
as big and small of “the same”, and all but one pair involve words in the special
declensions. The remaining example is a triplet, where the small member is
masculine, and the larger two are feminine:
(64)kǝpa
kut
palaim food parcel (for cooking in mumu), normal size
f big food parcel
f feast-sized food parcelUnfortunately, not much can be concluded from a single example. (Further,
masculine usage for the last word, palai, has been observed.)
Similar things of the same size can also be found in different genders: oga (m)
‘green parrot’, kilikilo (f) ‘red parrot’ (same size); mareŋ (m) ‘red parrot’
(different kind).

are too many to include here, but examining the words and the fishes gives no
indication that size matters for gender.35
Among snakes, smaller snakes show a tendency to have feminine gender:36

msnake (generic)
snake (sp; small, still, many colours, found high in bush)
snake (sp; small, fast)
sea snake (sp; white sometimes black spot/stripe, bites)
sea snake (sp; bl/wh hooped, does not bite)
python (southern Kuot)
python (northern Kuot)More names of snakes would be needed to make a valid generalisation. The python is a larger snake than the others in the list, but also has mythological properties, whereby a snake can turn into a man (leaving the skin behind).
The word for ‘stone’, adǝs/tadǝs, is interesting in that a size-based gender distinction is made: small stones are masculine and big stones are feminine. Speakers were unable to think of parallel examples.
Generally, among birds and insects, “special designs”, i.e., unusual types, or
particularly large kinds are not found in the same gender; for instance bǝŋabǝŋa
‘hornbill’ and kriskau ‘New Ireland bird of paradise’ are masculine while dudur
‘owl’ and kuoŋ ‘heron’ are feminine; lǝkikiar ‘centipede’, kakoburik ‘spider’
and kunmǝra ‘scorpion’ are feminine while paskikidoŋ ‘mayfly’ is masculine.
Of three words for rays, afǝra ‘stingray (spp.)’ is feminine, while nadaila
‘stingray (sp.)’ is masculine, and lǝsigilu ‘manta ray, spotted eagle ray’ is feminine. Nor are small or “ordinary” species found in the same gender.
Water, sharp tools and fire are further categories which sometimes have particular gender associations (for instance in the Australian language Dyirbal
(Dixon 1972: 44–47, 306–312), made famous in Lakoff’s (1987) title as “Women, fire, and dangerous things”, since these categories are all feminine in
Dyirbal). In Kuot, they all show a tendency to be feminine, but several of the34 Allen & Swainston (1993).
35 It is possible to imagine that fish names are to some extent secondary, in the sensethat fish may be named for other items. For instance, one fish shares a name with a
bird (aruku), and speakers say that the bird sense is primary. A few more terms are
descriptive, such as i-lǝ kidi ‘slippery’ for wrasses and parrot fishes, and kǝkket la “impatient” for Janssen's wrasse, a fish that bites very quickly. For the most part, however,
the names seem to be primary, i.e. denoting the fish without relation to other parts of
the vocabulary.
36 This principle was pointed out by my informant Robert Sipa while discussing gen-der, and is borne out by the data, which however is limited.","[202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208]"
"1465 NOUNS
Nouns have the inherent and covert property of gender – masculine and feminine, distinguished in the singular only, and the referent-determined and inflectional property of number – singular, dual, and non-singular (plural). The gender and number of the noun control agreement on demonstratives in the noun
phrase, as well as the form of possessives, indexing morphology on prepositions, and cross-referencing morphology on verbs and adjectives.
The main source of loans at present, not surprisingly, is Tok Pisin.

Introduction to Kuot nouns
Before going into detail about the various properties of Kuot nouns, it will be
useful to have an overview of the most important features of the system.
Kuot nouns are divided into eleven declensions on the basis of the shape of the
singular form (and its relation to non-singular form). About half the nouns in
the language belong in the “plain declension”, where the non-singular is
formed by simple addition of the ending -(i)p to the singular form of the noun
(with labialisation harmony causing the vowel to be /u/ in some circumstances;
see below). The rest fall into the ten “special declensions”, in most of which the
last part of the singular form is subtracted before the non-singular ending -(i)p
is applied, e.g.:
(1)kiraima
nail/claw
‘nail/claw’kiraip
nail/claw.nsg
‘nails/claws’The special declensions are not productive. They are presented in 5.2.
Further, there are some non-singular patterns that cut across declensions (in
particular those that have a non-singular ending -bip), as well as irregular nonsingular formations (5.3) including a few cases of suppletive forms (5.3.3). A
number of words denoting persons form alternative non-singulars and duals on
another pattern; most of these are kin terms (5.4).
A noun form referring to a plural entity is called “non-singular” rather than
“plural” here, for two reasons. First, the non-singular forms the basis of dual in
nouns:
(2)alaŋ
alaŋ-ip
road(sg) road-nsg
‘road’
‘roads’alaŋ-ip-ien
road-nsg-dl
‘two roads’Second, the dual form in nouns is used mainly for animate referents, while the
non-singular form is often used for dual as well as plural inanimate referents
(see 5.5).","[168, 169]"
