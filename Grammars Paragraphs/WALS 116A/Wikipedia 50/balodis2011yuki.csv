This section describes questions in Huchnom and Coast Yuki.
15.8.3.1. Huchnom
Lamb (1955:31) records several Huchnom content questions and their responses. The
questions begin with a question word, as in Yuki. The verbs in these questions appear
to be affixed with -ˀą, which may possibly be cognate with the Yuki interrogative -ha.
Compare the question in (54a) with its answer in (54b). Note the presence of -ˀą at
the end of the verb hayima:ˀą ‘doing’ in the question in (54a), and its absence on the
same verb in (54b).

generalizations regarding their characteristics. (56) shows an example of a polar
question. As in (54a-b) and (55), the question in (56) ends in -ˀą. It is assumed that theClause Structure411verb ha:mɛhˀą means ‘want’ due to its similarity in appearance to the Yuki verb of the
same meaning (see, for example, hámek ‘want’ in CW:132).

The verb root can be discerned as méh- ‘be’, but aside from this too little is known of
Coast Yuki verb morphology to classify the morphemes attached to meh-. (57) shows
this question and answer pair.

15.9.2. Negative Verb ṭal-The use of ṭal- is not fully understood. It appears as an independent verb with a
negative meaning akin to ‘to be not’ and also is found at the end of verbs, which are
translated with a negative meaning. ṭąl- also appears in the Yuki negative response to
polar questions: ṭąlk ‘no’ or ‘(it) is not’.
In (64) and (65), ṭal- is used as an independent verb. In each of its uses in these two
examples, it occurs in the same form, tąlṭilinik ‘do not let yourself, must not let
yourself’.

(66) and (67) show ṭąl- following verbs that have a negative meaning. ṭal- was

unknown whether ṭąl is encliticized to the preceding verb or an independent verb. In

This section describes negation in Huchnom and Coast Yuki.
15.9.5.1. Huchnom
To the extent that it is understood, negation in Huchnom appears to function in much
the same way as in Yuki. A negative morpheme -t̯al is added to the verb in order to
negate it. The Huchnom negative -t̯ǝl appears similar in form to the Yuki negatives -ṭan
and ṭal-.
Contrast the negative sentences in (77) and (78) with the affirmative clause in (79).

15.9.5.2. Coast YukiA small number of minimal pairs show the contrast between negative and affirmative
clauses. It seems from these examples that Coast Yuki may have employed a different
method for negation than Yuki or Huchnom. Negative clauses begin with ˀi:ma- or ˀi:mi-Clause Structure419and verbs in these clauses are affixed with -t. In the few available examples, ˀi:ma-, ˀi:miis found only in negative clauses.

Dependent clauses are formed in Yuki by attaching the dependent clause marker =namli
to the verb, by attaching the demonstrative =kiˀ or one of its derived forms, such as
kimasi directly to the verb, or by attaching to the verb one of several enclitics that are
also typically found with the switch-reference marker. The dependent clause marker
=namli displaces the mood and tense markers found in Position XI on the verb
template266. Other enclitics, such as =ka in (97) and =kiˀ in (109) are found attached to
mood and tense markers. Since these enclitics do not displace mood and tense markers,
they areplaced in Position XII of the verb template (cf. §7.2).
Relative clauses can be formed by attaching the relative clause marker =namli or one
of its derived forms to the verb. Alternatively, they can be formed by attaching =kiˀ or
one of its derived forms to the verb. Relative clauses in Yuki are either postnominal or
headless. Adverbial clauses are formed by attaching one of the adverbial forms of
=namli, one of the adverbial forms of =kiˀ, or one of several temporal coordinating
enclitics to the verb.
Serial verbs are another dependent clause construction found in Yuki. Non-final
verbs in the serial verb construction can be inflected with aspect markers, but only the
final verb in the sequence is marked with finite =mil.
15.10.1. =namli dependent clause marker
=namli is the dependent clause marker used to indicate relative and adverbial clauses.
=namli never occurs on its own on verbs. It is always further encliticized with the distal
demonstrative ki, one of its derived forms, or the temporal coordinating enclitics
=(k)on ~ =kan ‘though’ or =ka ‘when’. Therefore in addition to marking a clause as
dependent, =namli also acts as a base for attaching other morphology that specifies the
type of relative or adverbial clause. Table 36 shows all of the derived forms of =namli
observed in the texts. Examples of each of these =namli forms are provided in §15.10.2
and §15.10.3.","[440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448]"

hąwhaˀ ‘yes’ (AA).
A phonemic glottalized form /y’/ exists for the other Yuki glide /y/, thus the
existence of phonemic /w’/ in Yuki would not be unexpected. In addition, /w’/ also
exists in Wappo (Thompson et al. 2006:3), therefore there is a precedent for this
phoneme in Yukian. Phonemic /s’/ on the other hand is extremely rare typologically
and occurs only phonetically or allophonically in the non-Northern Yukian languages
spoken in the region surrounding Yuki.
2.1.1.5. Resonants
Nasals occur in two places of articulation: bilabial and dental. The lateral approximant
is dental, the central approximants are bilabial and palatal. Plain and glottalized
variants are distinguished for all nasals and approximants. Glottalized nasals and
glottalized approximants are pre-glottalized.
2.1.1.6. Gemination
There are no phonemic geminate consonants in Yuki. However, sequences of two
identical consonants can result in phonetic geminates. These are found from time to
time at morpheme boundaries, as a result of the coda consonant of one morpheme
being the same as the onset of the subsequent morpheme49. Only one instance of this
type of phonetic geminate is found in the Logan recording. As shown in (2), a phonetic
geminate /m/ occurs in kómmuṭ ‘came’ when -mą, a verbal suffix indicating movement,
is suffixed onto the verb root kom- ‘come.’

This chapter describes the morphology of Yuki verbs. The discussion begins with an
overview of the major characteristics of Yuki verb morphology and the verb template.
The discussion is further divided into sections on inflectional and derivational
morphology.
7.1. Overview
Yuki verbs are root-initial and, with the exception of the body prefixes discussed in
§2.2.1.1 and §7.3.2, all inflectional and derivational verb morphology takes the form of
suffixes or enclitics. The boundaries between morphemes in the verb are generally
fairly clear phonologically, though some assimilation and allomorphy is present157.
Verbs are suffixed with a rich collection of morphology indicating tense, aspect,
mood, transitivity, negation, questions, evidentiality, and dependent clauses. The Yuki
verb has a templatic structure: suffixes are attached to the root in a particular order
relative to each other. Yuki shows no argument marking on the verb itself158. Instead,
arguments are referenced using switch-reference markers159 and/or with actual noun
or pronoun arguments.
7.2. Verb Template
The Yuki verb template is shown in Table 17. The template shows the order that verb
morphology takes within a verb. All verb morphology, except for the body prefixes,
follows the verb root and takes the form of either suffixes or enclitics. No verbs exist
with all positions filled on the template. Most verbs have only a few slots filled on the
template. Within serial verb constructions160, verbs can occur as bare roots without any
additional verb morphology.
157See Chapter 3 for further discussion of morphophonology.
Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:12) note that in two circumstances personal pronouns act as clitics: “(1) If
a sentence consists of only a verb and a patient pronoun, the pronoun is postponed to the verb; for
example, šaˑteštekˀe ‘I’m getting cold’ < šaˑteštek + ˀiˑ. The pronoun is here intermediate between a word
and a suffix… Compare, however, čaˑna ˀi ‘Give it to me!’, where the pronoun follows the verb but remains
an independent word. (2) In the speech of Arthur Anderson, ˀąp ‘I’ sometimes becomes ˀup, its vowel
being assimilated to an u in the following verb, for example, kawaye ˀup munhek ‘I’m going to steal that
horse.’ In this case, the pronoun could be considered prefixed to the verb.”

(PNY)161, noting that there may well have been additional position classes in PNY.
Kroeber (1911) describes the morphology and characteristics of the Yuki verb, but does
not provide any information on the relative order of morphology attached to the verb
root.
7 .3. Verb Root and Body Prefixes
7.3.1. Verb Root
The verb root is usually monosyllabic and CVC162. Words of other word classes can
function as verb roots when suffixed with verb morphology163. Examples of this are
shown in Table 18.
N on-- VerbVerbwoknám ‘initiation’ (OG:115a)woknámespaˀ ‘(they) shall make
initiation’ (OG:177b)
kimáseypa:mikí ‘thus (they) would do’
(CW:36)
ta:tą́lilmil ‘(he) made himself over’
(CW:255)kimás ‘thus’ (CW:185)
tat ‘good, well’ (CW:255)Table 18: Verbalized words of other word classes
Verb roots can be affixed with many types of derivational morphology to derive new
meanings. For example, as shown in Table 19, the verb roots kap- ‘enter’ and nąw- ‘see’
can take on the following meanings depending on the verb morphology that has been
affixed to the root.","[243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250]"

The interrogative mood -ha(ˀ) ~ -ˀa(ˀ) 190 is used in the formation of polar questions and
content questions. The interrogative -ha or one of its allomorphs is attached to the end
of verb in place of any other tense or mood marking. Kroeber (1911:363) refers to -haˀ as
the “interrogative” and Schlichter (1985:64) reconstructs *-ˀa as the interrogative mode
suffix in PNY.

7 .6.2. Coast Yuki
There exist few data on Coast Yuki verbs compared to the available material on Yuki
and Huchnom. Therefore little can be said about the specific structure or nature of
Coast Yuki verb morphology except that at a glance it seems similar to that of Yuki and
Huchnom.
As can be seen in the examples below, there appear to be some endings recognizable
from Yuki, such as a possible declarative ending -kʻ in (194), an imperative perhaps
ending in a final glottal stop or a glottal stop followed by a vowel in (196) and (197), a
question suffix that also appears to include a vowel and a glottal stop in (199), and an
agentive/instrumental ending that appears similar to that seen in Yuki and Huchnom
in (200) and (201). At the same time, as can be seen in (198), apparently some
imperatives also end in -kʻ, which is different from what is known in Yuki and
Huchnom.

2198 . ADJECTIVES
This section discusses adjectives and their morphology. Attributive and predicate
adjectives act as distinct subclasses of adjectives in Yuki. Predicate adjectives are
suffixed with verb morphology and function as verbs.
8.1. Attributive Adjectives
Attributive adjectives are independent words and can either precede or follow the
noun within the noun phrase. The pragmatics of these two word orders are not
apparent from elicited examples or examples found in the texts.
8.1.1. Word Order within the Noun Phrase
(1) and (2) are elicited examples. In (1), the adjective hoṭ ‘large’ follows the noun t’um
‘rain’.

This section describes the pronouns and pronoun morphology of Huchnom and Coast
Yuki.
6.2.1. Personal Pronouns
Table 14 compares Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast Yuki personal pronouns. Huchnom and
Coast Yuki third person personal pronouns, just as in Yuki, can also be used as
demonstratives. Lamb’s (1955) elicited Huchnom material shows more frequent use of
proximal kaˀ as a third person pronoun than the Yuki material. An inclusive/exclusive
is made for first person plural pronouns in Yuki and Huchnom, and there is evidence
that such a distinction may have also existed in Coast Yuki.
All three languages distinguish agent and patient pronouns. Yuki and Coast Yuki
dative pronouns are documented. The existence of dative pronouns in Huchnom can
only be inferred from oblique pronominal forms. In Yuki such oblique pronouns are
formed by attaching the case ending to a dative pronoun. Similarly, in Huchnom ˀehkil’
‘towards me’ and ˀεhpɪs ‘away from me’, the case ending appears to be affixed to a
pronoun ˀeh ~ ˀεh, which is different than the Huchnom first person singular agent
pronoun epe ~ εpε:.","[230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235]"

A book such as this is a work of many hearts and many minds. My research and writing
is represented in the pages that follow, but this work would never have been possible
without the support of such a multitude of individuals.
First and foremost, as this grammar is based on my doctoral dissertation, I wish to
express my deepest gratitude to the members of my dissertation committee, Marianne
Mithun, Sandy Thompson, Matt Gordon, and Carmen Jany. Their work, support,
counsel, and advice were not only instrumental in writing this grammar, but also to me
personally throughout the years during my graduate studies.
Marianne Mithun introduced me to the Yuki language. We had previously already
cooperated on research on the Kato language, also spoken in Northern California in the
same region as Yuki. Shortly after that time Marianne suggested the Yuki language to
me as a possible focus for my dissertation. I’m fortunate and deeply grateful to
Marianne for suggesting this topic to me. I’m also deeply thankful for her support not
only during the research and writing of this grammar, but throughout the years of my
graduate studies and since that time. Our thought-provoking conversations on a vast
array of languages for which we both share a passion have meant a great deal to me
and have also helped shape and grow my thinking as a linguist.
Sandy Thompson is the preeminent authority on the Wappo language, which is the
only well-documented genetic relative of Yuki. During the course of my graduate
studies I had the great fortune to cooperate with Sandy on other research involving the
emergence of language structures in connected speech. When I decided to write my
dissertation on Yuki, it seemed an amazing stroke of luck that I could have Sandy as a
member of my committee and to have the benefit of her advice and knowledge on
language structure and the Yukian languages in particular. I’m grateful and deeply
thankful for this and also for the many wonderful hours I’ve gotten to spend with
Sandy over these years discussing the many linguistic topics for which we share a deep
love.
Matt Gordon and I both share an interest in the Finnic languages and also the
languages of Northern California. Early in my graduate studies Matt and I cooperated
on research on the prosody of Livonian and other less spoken Finnic languages. At that
time prosody was an entirely new field of linguistic study for me and I’m deeply
grateful to Matt for introducing me to this field and for allowing me to benefit from his
knowledge. Thanks to Matt and the research we cooperated on, I was able to write a
much more in-depth study of Yuki prosody for this grammar. I’m deeply thankful toxxiiAcknowledgementsMatt for this knowledge and his support and help over the years.
Carmen Jany is the author of Chimariko Grammar, which was based on her
dissertation – a study very much like this grammar. Her work laid the foundation for a
great deal of my own thinking of how to approach the task of writing a complete
description of a language based only on archival material and a few recordings. I was
delighted when Carmen agreed to be a member of my committee and in the ensuing
months her insight, advice, and comments proved invaluable in bringing this grammar
to its final form. I’m deeply thankful and grateful to Carmen for all she has done to help
me complete this work.
I wish to thank the speakers of Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast Yuki, as well as the
researchers who worked with these speakers. All of these individuals deserve a
profound amount of gratitude and appreciation for their labor and cooperation in the
documentation of these languages. In particular I would like to express my
indebtedness for the work of Yuki speaker Ralph Moore and Alfred L. Kroeber, which
yielded the amazing wealth of Yuki language material that allowed for this description
of the Yuki language to be written. Many other researchers have written excellent
studies of aspects of Yuki grammar, but I would express my gratitude and appreciation
in particular to Alice Schlichter-Shepherd for her excellent and insightful work. Yuki
Vocabulary, which she co-authored with Jess Sawyer, her study of Yuki tone, and
reconstruction of Proto-Northern Yukian proved invaluable in the course of the writing
of this grammar.
I would like to thank Tim Powell and Charles Greifenstein of the American
Philosophical Society and Andrew Garrett, Justin Spence, and John Sylak of the Survey
of California and Other Indian Languages for their help during the course of my
research. I would like to express my gratitude to the American Philosophical Society
and the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages for providing the bulk of the
Yuki language materials I consulted in writing this grammar.
I would like to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to Carol Genetti for her
teaching and the great amount that I learned from her about language documentation
and description. I would also like to express my thanks and appreciation to Willem de
Reuse for his friendship and for teaching me so much about field linguistics.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude and indebtedness to Mary Rae Staton,
whose friendship, support, and counsel have meant so much to me during the years of
my graduate studies and since. I would also like to thank Dana Spoonerow, Karen
Barteld, Cami Helmuth, and Ra Thea for their kindness and help over the years. I would
like to thank Alex Walker for providing insight and information on the Southern PomoAcknowledgementsxxiiilanguage and also for many wonderful conversations about Northern California
languages in the time we both were students at UCSB and in the years since that time. I
would also like to thank him for his help in finding certain articles and other materials
necessary to me during the editing of this grammar prior to its publication. I would also
like to thank Andrea Berez for her friendship, support, and good sense of humor during
the course of our doctoral studies. I would like to express my appreciation to Andra
Kalnača for the thoughtful insight regarding the wording of the dedication. I would also
like to express my deepest gratitude to Ofelia Zepeda, Leslie Tolbert, and Tapani
Salminen, for their support, friendship, and inspiration from my earliest years as a
linguist.
My mother, Māra Trapāne, who shares my passion for language and knowledge, has
been a constant support and source of inspiration and encouragement throughout my
life and especially during my years of graduate school. My step-father, Andris Trapāns,
and my father, Agnis Balodis, unfortunately did not live to see the day that I completed
my doctorate, but both served as a model and inspiration to me for the joys of living a
life of the mind. I wish to express my deepest and most heartfelt love and gratitude to
my parents for all of their support and love over the course of my lifetime. I would also
like to thank them for teaching me and for raising me speaking our family’s Latvian
language. Though it is my first language, my initial interest in linguistics came through
my knowledge of Latvian and my fascination in comparing it to English and to its
relatives, Lithuanian and Old Prussian.
I would also like to express a great measure of thanks to my entire family, both those
related to me by blood and those related to me by the bonds of love and friendship. The
encouragement and love of my husband, Caleb Roehrig, has been amazing and I’m
forever grateful to him for supporting me and being there with me through these
years. I’d also like to especially thank my good friend Dirk C. van Raemdonck whose
friendship, counsel, and insight have been so valuable to me throughout these years
and especially during the writing of this grammar and its subsequent editing. My dear
friend and brother, Todd Kessler, my dear family and friends, Lelde Gilman, Ilze
Menneking, Vija Valters, Gabriela Balodis, Romeo P. Guzman, Lauryn Salazar, John
Burnett, Leticia Burnett, Lucca Burnett, Rosemary Martin-Moore, Maria Pinheiro, Kirk

‘And dashing the sun a gainst the rock and breaking it up…’The terminative is also found attached to verbs or to demonstratives suffixed to
verbs and acting as relativizing suffixes. In both instances the terminative indicates a
direction and/or endpoint to the action described in the clause. In (95), a group of men
are pursuing Coyote and they have caught up with him in order to question him. The
terminative =k’il in ˀamilkílk’il ‘as they caught (him)’ appears to act as a subordinating
morpheme indicating that the pursuit of Coyote by the men has come to completion,
and now the men are questioning Coyote.

5.4.9. Difference between allative =wit and terminative =k’ilThe allative differs from the terminative in that the terminative indicates motion
toward particular individuals, as in pilątą:tk’il ‘toward the sun’ (CW:350) and toward
locations that appear to be small, usually well-defined, perhaps also enclosed, such as
hánk’il ‘(came) to the house’ (CW:293). The allative indicates motion toward cardinal
directions, as in kú:htkiwit ‘to the north’ (CW:107) and other major landmarks, such as
ˀu:khóˀoṭamwit ‘toward the ocean’ (CW:276) and lalkúhtkiwit ‘toward Lalkúhtki (a
placename)’ (CW:78).
5.4.10. =pis ablative
The ablative case =pis is used to indicate motion from, out of, or away from a location.
=pis has not been observed in use with human or other animate nouns. =pis can also be
used attached to verbs.
=pis is used to indicate motion out of or from a place in ˀu:kpis ‘from the water, out of
the water’, in (98), and in hánpis ‘out of the house’, in (99).

foam, while remaining in that location.

"1 5. CLAUSE STRUCTURE
This chapter describes the major clause types of Yuki253. These include declarative,
predicate nominal, predicate adjective, predicate oblique, question, imperative, and
negative clauses. Dependent clauses, including adverbial and relative clauses, and
complement clauses are also described.
There exist few earlier descriptions of Yuki syntax. Kroeber (1911:372) presents a
summary of his observations pertaining to syntax and word order. He also presents a
short text in Yuki with his observations of the function and meaning of individual
words, along with these other comments on Yuki syntax. The other main study
pertaining to Yuki syntax is presented by Mithun (2008), who describes Yuki argument
structure.
15.1. Constituent Order within the Clause
The most basic Yuki clause can contain just a verb. Clauses can also optionally contain
agent, patient, and dative arguments, adverbs, and obliques. This section describes
constituent order within the clause254. Yuki clauses tend to be verb-final255, but some
variation in word order does occur. (1) - (3) are examples of elicited clauses showing
verb-final word order. Verbs are given in bold in each example clause.

‘you fellows l aughed yesterday’253Argument structure is discussed in §5.2.
For constituent order within noun phrases see §5.7. Determiners are the other main type of
constituent that occur within noun phrases generally precede nouns within the noun phrase. Numerals
show more variation in position. See §9.3 for further discussion. Attributive adjectives can precede or
follow nouns, as discussed in §8.1.1.
255
The hearsay evidential ˀi is sometimes encliticized to an entire clause with the verb as the
morphological host, and therefore can be found following the verb in connected speech. Such cases are
counted as verb-final in this discussion.

A non-verb-final word order occurs when a sentence contains a complement clause.
This happens most often following quotations, as shown in (5) and (6), where quotative
inversion can be observed. The verbs in both quotes are clause-final. The verb in the
main clause in both examples is ˀímeymil ‘said’, which comes immediately after the
quote rather than at the end of the main clause. It is followed by its agent argument
hulk’oˀi ‘Coyote’. (6) also contains a patient k’óˀola ‘(to the) Wailaki’, which follows the
agent hulk’oˀi ‘Coyote’.

7.4.2.8. -(a)m imperfectiveThe imperfective aspect -(a)m is used to indicate actions which are ongoing and
without a defined endpoint. Schlichter (1985:62) reconstructs *-am/_C, CC_~-m/ as the
imperfective aspect marker in PNY. In Yuki, one also encounters these two different
forms for this morpheme: -am and –m, with the latter typically realized as –mi.
However, the environment that Schlichter proposes for this morpheme in PNY does
not describe the distribution in Yuki of –am compared to –m. Instead it appears that
-am is the form which occurs always with future tense179 –paˀ and most often or perhaps
also always with finite180 =mil. –m is most commonly seen before declarative =k and also
before the demonstratives kiˀ and kimas(i) and kiṭ(a) ‘here’ when these are suffixed onto
the verb in order to create a dependent clause. Also, it should be noted that –am and –m
do not co-occur within a single word.
Also, in the texts and elicited examples, -am and -m seem to alternate within the
same or similar words. In the texts (Origins: 5) Kroeber gives k’ąyyeyami ‘is talking’ as an
alternate form181 for k’ąyyeyimi. For their examples for the verb hąṭ- ‘doctor’, Sawyer
and Schlichter (1984:68) give a form containing -am in the example shown in (45a), but
a form containing -m in (45b).
In (45a), the matrix clause ‘I like/want to...’ is being used to elicit a bare root or in
this case a root without tense morphology. In this example the matrix clause is creating
a serial verb construction182. In (45b), this same root hąṭ- ‘doctor’ followed by -am is
suffixed with declarative =k yielding a form hą:ṭmek ‘is doctoring’ containing the -m
form of this morpheme instead of -am.
179There may be a special relationship between –am and –paˀ that remains to be understood. In polar
questions the future tense –paˀ takes on the form –paˀam.
180
In CW:53, the verb páˀiyimímil ‘raised’ occurs. –mí- may be the imperfective or it may possibly be a
misheard form of –mil-, which, according to the analysis of this grammar, can either be directional –mą
followed by mediopassive –il or, alternatively, a morpheme with an unknown meaning –mil.
181
Throughout the texts Kroeber occasionally gives alternate forms for certain words. No explanation is
given in the texts or accompanying notes detailing the origin of these forms.
182
See §15.10.4 for further discussion of serial verb constructions.","[272, 273]"

Verbs are also found occasionally with noun morphology. In addition to adverbial
clause morphemes, such as, =op ‘while’, noun case enclitics are also found on verbs.
In (176), the juxtapositive =iṭ is found in hąwlám miˀíčop ‘when the beginning of the

"Introduction31 .1. The Yuki Language
This section contains a description of the genetic affiliation of Yuki, the location of the
historical Yuki speech community, Yuki identity, dialect divisions, and contact
languages.
1.1.1. Background and Genetic Affiliation
The Yuki language is a member of the Yukian language family and has only a single
possible generally agreed upon relative, the Wappo language (Mithun 1999:574). Wappo
was spoken to the southeast of the Yuki-speaking region, in the Russian River Valley,
north of San Francisco, California (Thompson et al 2006:xi). A genetic relationship
between Yuki and Wappo is at present more accepted than not, though some have
argued that similarities between Yuki and Wappo are ultimately due to language
contact rather than a shared origin (Sawyer 1980).
Yuki itself is divided into three varieties1: Yuki (Proper), Huchnom2, and Coast Yuki,
which are collectively referred to as the Northern Yukian languages (Golla 2011:188).
Elmendorf (1968) describes Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki as “language-like
dialects” that formed a chain from east to west. The three varieties of Yuki have nearly
identical grammar and differ mainly in terms of their phonology and lexicon (Golla
2011:189).
1Arguments can be made for calling Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki dialects of a single
language or separate, but closely related languages. On one hand, they are grammatically very similar
and are thought to have been mutually intelligible (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:211, Golla 2011:188-189). On the
other hand, speakers of Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki inhabited ecologically distinctterritories and differed in terms of their significant ceremonies and myths (see §1.4). It is possible that
the relationships among the Northern Yukian languages were not unlike those among the Scandinavian
languages or Spanish and Portuguese; a group of distinct ethnicities speaking languages of a high degree
of mutual intelligibility. However, this may also be a question that could remain unanswerable due to the
lack of speakers of any of these languages or extant Coast Yuki and Huchnom communities.
2
The Huchnom have also been referred to as the “Redwoods,” or by their Pomo appellation Tatu, while
the term Huchnom means “mountain people” (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:202). Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:155)
give a different translation for Huchnom. They connect it with Yuki huč ‘outside’, so that hučnom’ would
mean ‘outside people’. In Lamb’s (1955:27) notes, the pronunciation of “Huchnom” as spoken by his
consultant Lulu Johnson is given as hú̩čnó̩ˀom̥ in Lamb’s orthography or approximately [hutʃnoʔom̥] in
IPA. The [oʔo] segment is a result of the spreading of glottalization of the word-final glottalized sonorant
to the preceding vowel. This is a common process also in Yuki (see Chapter 2), therefore most likely
Huchnom was also pronounced as [hutʃnoʔm] in a form without this spreading. The Coast Yuki referred
to themselves as Ukoht-ontilka ‘ocean people’. (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:212)4University of California Publications in LinguisticsThe term “Yuki” has been used to refer to the Northern Yukian languages in general,
but also to the Yuki (Proper) language in particular. In order to avoid confusion, in this
grammar the term “Yuki” is used to refer only to the Yuki (Proper) language, while
Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki are collectively always referred to as
“Northern Yukian.”
While Wappo is more different from all of the Northern Yukian languages than any
of these languages are from each other, the exact relationship among the three
varieties of Northern Yukian is unclear. Kroeber (1925 [1976]:211) writes that the Coast
Yuki considered their speech to be more similar to that of the Huchnom than that of
the Yuki. This would make a certain amount of sense as the Coast Yuki were
geographically closer to and likely in more frequent contact with the Huchnom than to
the Yuki. However, Kroeber notes that the lexicon of Coast Yuki seems to be about
equally similar to that of Huchnom and Yuki, but that a thorough analysis of the three
Northern Yukian varieties will be necessary before a final determination of internal
relationships can be made. In terms of intelligibility, Kroeber speculates that all three
languages must have been mutually intelligible to some extent, but that a Coast Yuki
unacquainted with either Huchnom or Yuki would not have been able to follow a
conversation fully in either of these languages.","[30, 31, 32]"

šiloˀ ‘like’ is a common word, which also appears as part of hilkšiloˀ ‘everything’ 242 and
halšiloˀ ‘differently’. It is unclear whether šiloˀ is an independent word, clitic, or both. On
verbs šiloˀ acts as an evidential with a meaning of ‘it seems like’ or ‘it appears like’.243
(5) - (7), are examples šiloˀ ‘like’ following nouns.

k’ol ‘other’ is another common word, also appears in a number of other derived forms.
In (8), k’ol is seen in all three of these roles. It acts as an adjective in k’olá:ṭat ‘other
peoples’, as an adverb in kimáse k’ól’ yúːyampaːmikíː ‘who ever would do differently’, and
is affixed with juxtapositive =iṭ and nominalizer -am in k’olčam ‘elsewhere about’. Table

A separate chapter is devoted to the Yuki system of marking switch-reference and some
of the other morphology that is found with the switch-reference markers, because
these words and affixes form an important morphological class in Yuki. Switchreference is the use of grammatical markers to indicate whether two subsequent
clauses have the same or different topic (Jacobsen 1967, Austin 1981:309). Much like
neighboring languages, such as Eastern Pomo (McLendon 1996:539-541), Central Pomo
(Mithun 1993), and Southern Pomo (Walker 2013). The Yuki switch-reference complex,
discussed in §14.1, tracks referents between clauses and notes the temporal dimension
of these events. That means the Yuki system allows speakers to state whether events
occurred in sequence, simultaneously, or as a result of each other.
14.1 Switch-Reference Markers and Clause Connectors
In Yuki, switch-reference is indicated with a series of morphemes that nearly always
occur clause-initially. These switch-reference markers can be affixed with a connective
enclitic and are nearly always followed by the hearsay evidential ˀi, which is usually
realized phonetically as either [ey] or [iy]. Together this clause-initial reference
connective takes the form shown in Figure 9.
Switch-reference marker
Connective enclitic
or Clause Connector
Figure 9: Form of the clause-initial reference complexHearsay evidential ˀiThe clause-initial reference complex does not have to have all three slots filled. If the
reference complex is present at the start of a clause, it will always contain the switchreference marker and then optionally a connective enclitic and/or the hearsay
evidential ˀi 244. The switch-reference marker does not usually appear alone, but is
typically followed by one or both of the other elements of the reference complex.
Kroeber (1911:369-370) does not differentiate between the switch-reference markers,
clause connectors, or connective enclitics in his description of this system:244The connective enclitics are discussed in §14.2.","[389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395]"
"412University of California Publications in Linguistics1 5.9. Negative Clauses
The primary method for negation in Yuki is the negation of the verb by the suffixation
of a negative morpheme -ṭan to the verb265. There is also a negative verb ṭal-, the use of
which is not fully understood. In connected speech, use of -ṭan is much more common
than ṭal-. In elicited speech, -ṭan is also more common, and ṭal- is almost never seen.
15.9.1. Negation using -ṭan

The stress pattern of this verb suggests that the root is a compound. In this case, the first syllable nącould be the body prefix (see Table 6) associated with the head. The second syllable k’oh- could perhaps
be analyzed as the verb k’o- ‘get in, put’ followed by the durative suffix –h, yielding a meaning along the
lines of ‘to get into the head on an ongoing basis’.","[506, 507]"
"225This alternation is also discussed in §3.5.
The root of tíˀαteˀékay ‘I have been sick’ is likely the same as dɪ́ʻday ‘I am sick in bed’ in (41). The
difference in spelling is due to differences in the transcription of the two linguists, Kroeber and
Harrington, respectively, who originally recorded these examples.

The Yuki numeral system is octonary. This means that numerals are counted in groups
of eight with a new cycle of the count beginning again at 9, 17, etc. Octonary systems
are uncommon cross-linguistically. Kroeber gives the following lengthy but interesting
account of his experience learning about and documenting the Yuki numeral system.
The Yuki system of counting - and it alone among the Yukian languages - is
not decimal or quinary, but octonary. Only the Salinan and Chumash, far to
the south, follow an analogous quaternary method. It is remarkable that the
Yuki counted on their fingers as regularly as any other people in the State.
The explanation is that they did not count the fingers but the spaces between
them, in each of which, when the manipulation was possible, two twigs were
laid. Naturally enough their “hundred” was 64.
The younger men, who have associated with the Americans, seem not to
realize that their fathers thought by eights instead of tens, and are so
confused in consequence that they give the most contradictory accounts of
even the lowest native numerals. The old generation, on the other hand, is
as innocent of our method. One of these survivors, when asked if he knew
how many fingers he had, answered without hesitation, huchamopesul, ten.
Asked how many finger and toes he had, he replied he did not know. If the
query had been how many spaces there were between his fingers and toes,
which would trip up many a civilized person required to answer without
calculation or actual count, he would no doubt have known instantly. Two
pairs of hands were then spread before him as the accepted equivalent of his
own fingers and toes, and he began a laborious count, pushing the digits
together into groups of fours. The result he announced was molmihuipoi,
nineteen. Unaccustomed to handling fingers, he had overlooked a thumb.
When the same man was allowed to place pairs of little sticks between his
own fingers, as was habitual to him, he reckoned rapidly and correctly.
The Yuki managed their count with only three real numeral words: panwi,
one; opi, two; molmi, three. Every other word denoting numbers up into the
hundreds is a description of the process of counting. Thus, a translation of
their numerals four to twenty runs as follows: two-forks, middle-in, evenchilki, even-in, one-flat, beyond-one-hang, beyond-two-body, three-body,
two-forks-body, middle-in-body, even-chilki-body, even-in-body, middle-332333Numeralsnone, one-middle-project, two-middle-project, three-middle-project, twoforks-middle-project. Sixty-four is two-fork-pile-at. There are sometimes
several ways of denoting a number. Thus eight is one-flat, or hand-two-only
(Kroeber 1925 [1976]:176-177).
Table 24 shows the cardinal numerals of the four Yukian languages2 27 . Ordinal
numerals are not recorded and not found in the texts. The data in Table 24 is given to
illustrate the numerals of the Yukian languages and to show the similarity in form of
the numerals in these four languages.

9 .1. =(ˀ)a(ˀ) ~ =(ˀ)ą(ˀ) on Numerals
Kroeber (1911:365-6) proposes that animacy is marked for numerals pąk or pąwi ‘one’ vs.
pąwa ‘one (animate)’, ˀopi ‘two’ vs. ˀopa ‘two (animate)’, and molmi ‘three’ vs. molma
‘three (animate)’. As discussed in §8.1.2, =(ˀ)a(ˀ) ~ =(ˀ)ą(ˀ), which is the morpheme at the
end of these numerals, most likely does not mark animacy. This is due to the fact that
occasional examples are found, such as (2), showing numerals without =(ˀ)a(ˀ) occuring
with animate nouns. For this reason the precise conditions when =(ˀ)a(ˀ) is used or not
used cannot be determined.
(1) shows examples of numerals with human and non-human animate nouns elicited
by Kroeber237. Note that in this series ˀomahąt ‘four’ also occurs with -a. These examples
are reproduced with Kroeber’s original notes concerning numeral forms that are not
permitted with a particular noun.

Verbs are negated with the negative -ṭan. A separate negative verb ṭąl- is used to form
negative clauses193. Kroeber (1911:361) notes the use of -tan and ṭąl- as negatives and

7.4.4.1. ˀi ~ ˀi: ~ ˀiy ~ ˀey hearsay evidential
The most ubiquitous element in Yuki connected speech may be ˀi. Kroeber (1911) calls
the hearsay evidential ˀi the dubitative particle and gives the following descriptions of
its use:
Particle used in myths to indicate that the narrative does not rest on the
personal experience of the narrator (1911:378)…dubitative particle, here
indicating the cessation of the direct discourse in which it is not used, and
the resumption of the narrative (380).
Most of the texts collected by Kroeber were myths. Therefore all of these texts are
replete with ˀi. Other texts, such as the translated Ents and Upek story, where the
speaker, Ralph Moore, still would not have had personal knowledge or experience of271Verbsthe events in those texts, are also filled with uses of ˀi. The one text that seems to be a
telling by Moore of an event that he personally witnessed, the Feather Dance Narrative,
contains no instance where ˀi is used. This suggests that Kroeber’s original description
of ˀi, as a marker of information that the speaker has no personal experience with, is
correct.
ˀi immediately follows the switch-reference marker and coordinating suffix, if it is
present, and immediately following quoted speech. ˀi is also found following larger
constituents within the clause, such as verb arguments and following individual verbs
within serial verb constructions. (107) and (108) show ˀi immediately following the
switch-reference marker and immediately following quoted speech.

‘Thereupon he asked him, “What was that, sister’s son, that you seemed to
be telling about?” said Coyote to Jackrabbit, asking him.’
In Kroeber’s transcription, ˀi usually is written as a single word with the switchreference marker or switch-reference marker and coordinating suffix. In other
positions Kroeber typically writes it as a separate word, but its position suggests that it
is a clitic marking certain types of constituents as reported or uncertain knowledge.
This can be seen in the above examples where ˀi is marking the referent specified by
the switch-reference marking as reported and the quote as reported.
ˀi is also often found affixed to larger constituents within a clause. In (109), the
argument ki lalkú:tk ˀaṭat ˀóykilnamlikimáse ‘those that had crowded into Lalkúhtki’ is
separated by ˀi from the verb míṭkilmil ‘filled up’ and its argument lál ‘lake’.

=hąli is a type of inferential evidential usually translated as ‘it seems’, ‘seems to’, or
‘must be’. It is most likely derived from the verb hąl- ‘hear’. In Kroeber’s original
transcriptions of the texts, =hąli is often glossed as ‘I guess’. =hąli attaches to verbs, but
is also found following the demonstrative kiˀ that is acting as a nominal ‘that one’. =hąli
is not mentioned in earlier studies of Yuki.
(110) - (113) are examples of =hąli used in the texts. In (110) and (111), =hąli is found
in ṭ’á:tlhąli ‘seemed to touch it’ and ną́winhąle ‘going to look, it seems’, respectively. In
(110), =hąli is also found in k’oˀhąliki: ‘where it was’ or ‘where it was inside’. 195

The free translations seem to incorporate many of the nuances in meaning expressed through the
morphology of the original Yuki. However, the free translations were originally published to be read by
an English-speaking audience, therefore it may be that Kroeber avoided using “seems” twice in this
example due to the awkwardness of this use in English: ‘But now where the sun seemed to be inside, as
he seemed to touch it, it squealed.’274University of California Publications in LinguisticsIn (112) and (113), =hąli follows kiˀ ‘DST’ with the meaning ‘that must be the one’. In
(112), =hąli also follows wi:lísiwiˀ ‘went by’, but Kroeber only translates =hąli in reference
to its use with kiˀ as ‘that must be the one’. The reasons for this are unclear, but they
may be the same as those discussed for (110).

In some cases verbs ending in -sik are not translated with an evidential meaning.
The evidential meaning may have existed in the original Yuki, but it is not translated by
Kroeber into English. li:támšik ‘are being killed’ in (116) is an example of this lack of

7.4.4.4. šiloˀ inferential evidential
šiloˀ can act as a hearsay evidential and may also have other uses196. As an evidential,
šiloˀ means ‘seems to’ and follows the word it is characterizing. šiloˀ can take the form of
an enclitic or can be affixed with verb morphology and function as a verb. Kroeber
(1911:358) provides this description for šiloˀ:
-cilo [-šilo] is a frequent suffix with the meaning “appearing to.” Often it can
be translated by “as it were,” or “it seems.” This suffix often has sufficient
stress-accent to furnish some justification for considering it an independent

"224University of California Publications in Linguisticsby Ralph Moore of an event that he had actually witnessed, but perhaps without
reference to a specific instance of witnessing this event.
In the free translation of the texts, verbs ending with =mil are usually translated in
the past tense by Kroeber, as shown in the excerpt in (1).

The frequency of =mil in the texts stands in contrast its complete absence in past
tense forms in elicited material. In the material elicited from Frank Logan by James
Crawford and the material elicited from Minnie Fulwider by Roy Siniard, past tense
forms given in English are never translated by the speakers into Yuki with a verbVerbs225ending in =mil. As shown in (2) - (6), if the past tense is overtly translated at all, the
preferred past tense endings are -wiṭ(k) and -wi ~ -u.

However, it is consistent with the available evidence that =mil is used in Yuki as a
means for marking events that occur without a specific time reference.
The status of =mil as an enclitic rather than a suffix can be seen in serial verb
constructions. In these sequences, each verb can take various aspectual or modal
suffixes, but only the final verb in the construction is marked with =mil. Therefore,
instead of being suffixed to individual verbs, =mil comes at the end of the verb phrase.
An example of =mil at the end of serial verb constructions is shown in (7) and (8).

"68University of California Publications in LinguisticsStating that as Uldall’s falling and dropping tones both descend in pitch, they should be
considered a single falling tone. Elmendorf (1968:22) describes Huchnom and Yuki as
having pitch accent with three pitches: high, low, and falling.
Schlichter (1978:6) notes that Uldall never claims that Yuki tones are contrastive and
in fact never provides a single tonal minimal pair. Schlichter reexamines Uldall’s claims
and argues that instead of being evidence for a system of phonemic tone or pitch
accent, the “tones” observed by Uldall are actually a consequence of several different
phenomena. She argues that Yuki is a stress-accent language with high and mid level
pitch acting as perceptual cues for primary and secondary stress, respectively (1978:245). She also observes that unaccented suffixes show mid, low, or falling pitch as a result
of sentence-level prosody (1978:20).
In one area, Schlichter (1978:23-4) finds evidence for the possible emergence of a
tonal or pitch contrast in Yuki. This is a result of the intervocalic weakening and
deletion of [ʔ] and [h] in VʔV and VhV sequences75, resulting in phonetic long vowels
with a falling pitch. The result is a series of possible minimal pairs shown in Table 7.
The deletion of these intervocalic segments is a result of fast speech (1978:23), but the
extent to which the falling pitch had truly phonemicized is not known.

Schlichter uses an acute accent ( ́) to mark high-level tone and a circumflex ( ̂) to mark high-falling
tone. High-level tone here is a result of primary stress, as primary stressed syllables have the highest
pitch in a word.
76Phonetics and Phonology692 .2.3. Intonation
The Logan recording does not contain any connected speech, and at this time no
recordings of Yuki connected speech are known to exist. The elicited words and
phrases do show certain prosodic features. Logan repeats each word or phrase twice.
The second repetition will sometimes show decreased f0 and intensity compared to the
first repetition. The final syllable of the second repetition will sometimes show
lengthening.
2.3. Syllable structure
Non-final syllables take the form CV(C). Final syllables can end in a cluster of two nonidentical consonants, CV(Cα)(Cβ). Words composed of a single CV syllable are quite rare.
All consonants except for glottalized sonorants and /s’/ can be syllable onsets: m, n, p,
p’, t̯, t’, ṭ, ṭ’, k, k’, ʔ, č, č’, s, š, h, w, y, l. All consonants except for glottalized stops and
affricates can be coda consonants: m, m’, n, n’, p, t̯, ṭ, k, ʔ, č, s, (s’), w, (w’), y, y’, l, l’. As
discussed below, there does not seem to be an absolute prohibition on glottalized stops
in coda position. Instead such consonants seem to be disfavored as codas. Consonant
clusters can occur in coda position, but only word-finaly. The shape of Yuki consonant
clusters is discussed in §2.1.1.7. Only vowels are permitted to be syllabic nuclei. All
vowels can occur in this position within the syllable: a, ą, i ~ e, o, u.
As discussed in §2.1.1.4.4, it is uncertain whether /s’/ and /w’/ ever occurred in
surface forms or only underlyingly; however, the position where these consonants
occur underlyingly is word-final and therefore syllable-final.
Glottalization in ejective stops and affricates occurring underlyingly in root-final
position typically spreads to the preceding vowel where it can be assimilated as a long
vowel or then further reduced to a short vowel. For example, ˀuk’ ‘water’ is realized as
ˀuˀuk ~ ˀu:k ~ ˀuk. Occasionally, one finds forms such as ˀu:t’ ‘weasel’ (Kroeber 1901a:4,
RM) and pá:t’.wá ‘flat’ (OG:76b), which may indicate that there is not an absolute
prohibition on syllable-final glottalized stops. However, such forms are the exception
rather than the rule and the far more likely surface form for such syllables will be one
where the syllable-final glottalization spreads to the preceding vowel as described
above for ˀuk’ ‘water’. Examples of Yuki words divided into syllables are shown in (39).","[95, 96, 97]"

Verbs in Huchnom and Coast Yuki are structured in the same way as in Yuki.
7.6.1. Huchnom
Huchnom is an agglutinating language, and many verb endings are recognizable and
similar to those of Yuki. (183) shows examples of corresponding affirmative and
negative clauses. The Huchnom negative -tǝl is analogous to the Yuki negatives -tan and
tal.

appear to be structured exactly as in Yuki. In Yuki imperatives can be formed by adding
an imperative morpheme -(ˀ)aˀ to the end of the verb or by glottalizing the final
consonant. (184) shows the Huchnom verb lak’- ‘come out’ with an imperative suffix -aˀ.
In (185), the final consonant of the Huchnom verb is glottalized forming the imperative
form hʌ̨wǝykil’ ‘eat!.’

"22University of California Publications in Linguisticsintermarriage between Ta’nom’ Yuki and Wailaki was common (Foster 1944:159). Golla
(2011:190) also discusses these interactions.
Among Yuki speakers themselves, knowledge of the dialect differences between
speakers from different Yuki tribal subdivisions was found among the Yuki speakers
that Kroeber (Kroeber 1931-1932/1958) and Foster (1944) encountered. Throughout the
period that Ralph Moore worked with Kroeber, Moore24 displayed knowledge of at least
three Yuki dialects: Uk’omnom’, Wit’ukomnom’, and Ta’nom’.
After contact with Euro-Americans, knowledge of English increased among the Yuki
and among other tribes that had been moved to Round Valley. English came to be the
language used between different Round Valley tribes soon after contact (Susman
1976:34). Yuki ceased to be a language of daily use early in the twentieth century. This
is evidenced by the fact that Ralph Moore’s ability to speak Yuki well appears to have
been a rarity among younger Yuki at the turn of the twentieth century (“An Indian
Who Gave,” 1902:7) and that the last speakers of Yuki, Minnie Fulwider and Arthur
Anderson, had last actively used Yuki in the early 1930s and 1908, respectively
(Elmendorf 1981:41-2).
1.5.2. Contexts of Use and Language Choice
Few details of the contexts of language use and choice prior and following contact with
Euro-Americans are known. Foster (1944:161) records the existence of a “high” form of
Yuki. He does not include any details of how this form of Yuki differed from “regular”
Yuki and Elmendorf (1981:40) comments on his own inability to find any examples of
this “high” form of Yuki. Foster’s (1944:161) description of the “high” form follows:
Those who spoke the k’oni hót (talk high) were also said to hálsi25. K’oni hót was a
refined speech, spoken by the well educated - those who had gone to the
Taikomol-woknam. It was not a secret language, since some of both sexes knew it
thoroughly, and those of lower class were acquainted with some of the
expressions. The distinction is similar to that in our own society between a
college graduate and one whose schooling has ended at the fifth grade.","[49, 50]"

"42University of California Publications in Linguistics2 .1.1.4.1. Alveolar /ṭ/ and Dental /t̯ /
Yuki distinguishes two /t/ phonemes: an alveolar stop /ṭ/, which has an apico-alveolar
pronunciation, and a dental stop /t̯/. A phonemic contrast between two /t/ phonemes
is a characteristic of the Northern California language area, as many of the languages of
this region make this contrast (Mithun 1999:316). Among the languages directly
bordering Yuki, this contrast exists in the Pomoan languages, but not in Wintu or
nearby California Athabaskan languages (Pitkin 1984:25, Golla 1970:25). In California,
this contrast is found in Chimariko, Yuki, Wappo, the seven Pomoan languages, the
seven or more Miwokan languages, the two or more Costanoan languages, Esselen,
Yokuts, Salinan, Yuman, Diegueño, Cocopa, and possibly in Mojave (Langdon and Silver
1984:141).
2.1.1.4.2. Post-Velar /k/ and /k’/
The place of articulation of /k/ and /k’/ is post-velar. Yuki /k/ and /k’/ are pronounced
further back than English /k/, but not so far back as to be considered uvular. The postvelar place of articulation for /k/ and /k’/ is not limited to the speech of Frank Logan,
as Kroeber (1911:348), who worked with Yuki speaker Ralph Moore, also makes this
observation stating that: “post-palatals…[are] apparently formed somewhat farther
back in the mouth than the ordinary English k sounds.”
2.1.1.4.3. /š/ and /č/
/š/, /č/, and /č’/ are classified as palato-alveolar consonants44. In Logan’s
pronunciation the place of articulation of these sounds is close to that of /ṭ/45.
2.1.1.4.4. /s’/ and /w’/
Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:10) include /s’/ as a possible phoneme and /w’/ as a
phoneme in the inventory of Yuki consonant phonemes. Neither of these consonants is
present in any Yuki word with the glottalized or pre-glottalized pronunciation that one44Langdon and Silver (1984:151) recognize Yuki as having a dental stop /t̯/, an alveolar or postalveolar
stop /ṭ/, and a postalveolar or retroflex fricative /ʂ/, but not a postalveolar or retroflex affricate /tʂ/.
45
The postalveolar or retroflex quality in the pronunciation of /š/ was also noted by Kroeber, who would
transcribe some instances of /š/ as <ṣ>, as in: hą́:ʂimil ‘(Taykómol) told him to build’ (RM).","[69, 70]"

"28University of California Publications in LinguisticsMoore held an important position in Yuki society and cultural life. Moore and his
wife Lucy hosted grass games31 and roundhouse ceremonies on the land that he had
inherited from his mother (Bauer 2009:167, 169). After the Pentecostal Church came to
Round Valley in the 1930s, Ralph and Lucy Moore donated one half-acre of their land
for the building of a new Pentecostal church (2009:198).
While Ralph Moore was Kroeber’s primary Yuki consultant, the work he did with
Moore also involved other older Yuki speakers from time to time. During the period
when Moore and Kroeber began their collaboration, Moore was only in his late 20s, but
already possessed a deeper knowledge of Yuki language and culture than many of his
contemporaries. In 1932, Kroeber published the English versions of several of the
narratives that appear in the Yuki text examples in this grammar. In the introduction
to that collection, Kroeber (1932:905-6) provides this description of his work with
Moore, of Moore’s knowledge and ancestry, of the other consultants with whom Moore
and Kroeber worked, and also details which consultants told which myths32:
While the myths are few, they comprise the Yuki cosmogony, as taught in the
initiation to the Creator-cult or Taikomol-woknAm. The texts were all dictated by
Ralph Moore, at the time about 28 years old, who had learned them from his
father’s father, his mother’s father’s brother Pike, and a third old man Diddle
who was not a kinsman. Ralph’s own father had been ‘taken’ as a child and ‘sold’
in Santa Rosa to whites, so that, though he returned later to Round valley, he
did not learn the tribal traditions. The old men therefore imparted them to
Ralph as a boy, telling them over and over to him.
Ralph’s father’s father and Diddle were both Wit’ukAmnom, a southerly
division of the Yuki whose territory ranged from Eden valley south of South Eel
river, across this stream, into the southern part of Round valley. His father’s
father was, specifically, a Lalkûnom, from Lalkûhtki, at a pond or water hole
mentioned in myths IV and V, in southern Round valley. Diddle was specifically
a Suk’ānom, from Suk’ā, north of the South Eel. The former contributed myth V;
the latter, I and II. Ralph’s mother and her father’s brother Pike were Tā’nom.
This was a northwest Yuki group, on (the united) Eel river adjacent to the
31Foster (1944:194-5) gives a detailed description of grass game, called in Yuki áltoi-móltmil ‘stick tied [in
middle] gamble’. Foster calls grass game, “by all odds the favorite Yuki gambling game…[and] an
important social event that was often anticipated for several days.”
32
The Roman numeral indexes in Kroeber’s description correspond to the following Yuki Myths: I =
Origins: Taikomol, II = Origins: Second Version, III = Origins: Third Version, IV = Coyote and the World, V
= Thunder’s Twins, VI = Born-by-Washing, VII = Wildcat, VIII = Coyote and Crow, IX = Three CoyoteIntroduction29Wailaki and in their rituals resembling these Athasbascans at least as much as
the Ukomnom and Wit’ukAmnom Yuki. The fragmentary Origins version (III)
obtained from Pike is therefore of significance as showing that mythologically
the Tā’nom agreed fairly closely with the other Yuki. The remaining tales (IV,
VI-IX) Ralph probably learned either from Pike or from his paternal
grandfather.
Ralph has an excellent memory, is accurate and conscientious, and worked
hard to help me record right. To his personality is due the preservation of these
interesting myths. His contemporaries mostly know less and seem uninterested,
the present younger generation on the reservation is almost wholly ignorant of
tribal lore, and his elder would have been unable, for temperamental reasons,
slowly to dictate long texts consecutively.
To summarize, myths I, IV,V, VII, VIII were recorded in Yuki text from Ralph
Moore’s dictation based on his own memory; VI and VIII, from his dictation in
English only; while II and III were told to me respectively by Diddle and Pike in
Yuki and Englished by Ralph a paragraph at a time.
Detailed biographies could not be obtained of the other consultants who worked
with other linguists and whose data is incorporated into this grammar. I am including
the names of all of the known consultants here and my indebtedness to them and to
other possible consultants whose names are unknown. Ralph Moore, Pike, and Diddle

7.4.3. MoodThe Yuki system of mood distinguishes declarative, imperative, interrogative,
necessitative, permissive, speculative, and negative moods.
7.4.3.1. =k declarative
The declarative mood =k describes a state of affairs or an action without reference to a
specific time. Kroeber (1911:362) describes declarative =k as “generally translatable by
the present tense of English. It may imply continuance. It makes verbs of adjectival
stems.” Schlichter (1985:64) reconstructs *-k or *-ki as the declarative endings for
adjectives and *-ik or *-iki as the declarative endings for verbs.
As shown in (66) and (67) in elicited examples the declarative mood often occurs in
examples that are translated as present tense in English.

However, the declarative is also found translated as other tenses. In (68) and (69),
č’a:nik is translated as past tense ‘gave’, while lu:(h)mik is translated as future or
immediate future tense ‘gonna chop (right now)’. This shows that declarative =k is not255Verbsan indicator of present tense and does not of itself make reference to a particular time.

In connected speech, verbs ending in =k seem to be “setting the stage” or describing
the circumstances under which the events or actions described by other verbs in the
clause take place.
In Clause 36, in (70), túk huˀuˀík ‘ceasing to travel’ states the circumstances where the
dancing described by wó:kesmil ‘(they) danced’ occurs. In Clause 38, when it is time for
the travelers to stop dancing and to travel again, the same construction is used in
reverse. wók huˀúsk ‘stopping the dance’ states the circumstances where the traveling
described by ˀą́tą́ túkeymil ‘traveled on once more’ occurs.

7.4.3.2. -a(ˀ) ~ C#’ ~ Ø imperativeThe imperative mood -a(ˀ) ~ -C#’ ~ Ø 185 is used to form imperatives and prohibitives186.
No formal distinction is made between commands given to one person, versus
commands given to more than one person. Imperative verb forms are created by either
affixing -a(ˀ) to the verb or by glottalizing the final consonant of the verb. Sometimes
no overt marking may be present in imperatives (Sawyer and Schlichter 1984:111).
Kroeber (1911:363) calls -a the “usual imperative” and Schlichter (1985:65) reconstructs
*-aˀ and *-’ (glottalization of the final consonant) as the imperative forms in PNY.
Imperative -a(ˀ) takes the place of other tense or mood suffixes and occurs at the end
of the verb. ną́weta ‘look!’, in (77), tatísaˀ ‘make!’, in (78) and possibly both verbs in

‘Sometimes we dance 2 nights, sometimes 3 nights, sometimes one week.’
Kroeber describes =(ˀ)a(ˀ) as an animacy marker in his sketch of Yuki (1911:368). It is
true that =(ˀ)a(ˀ) does occur most often with animate nouns, but a further examination
of the pattern of use of =(ˀ)a(ˀ) shows that the occurrence with animate nouns is more a
symptom of its use rather than an explanation for its use.
First, it must be noted that for Yuki nouns in general the distinction between
animate and inanimate referents is not one of primary importance. Instead the
distinction that matters most in Yuki is that between human and non-human referents.
Core case-marking, for example, occurs for human, personified non-human, and also
occasionally for highly affected non-human referents; however, in general, non-human
animate referents are not marked for core case. Thus, it would be strange that in word
classes such as adjectives and numerals that often occur with nouns or, in the case of
numerals, can even function as nouns themselves, there would exist a significant
grouping (animate vs. inanimate) different from that seen for Yuki nouns in general
(human vs. non-human).
Second, it is true that =(ˀ)a(ˀ) does occur almost always on adjectives and numerals
referring to human nouns, even in elicitation, and also commonly those adjectives
referring to animate non-human nouns or even inanimates, as shown in the examples
in §8.1.2. One can also observe inconsistent use of =(ˀ)a(ˀ) with the same noun-adjective
pairs, suggesting that the function of =(ˀ)a(ˀ) is not to mark animacy itself, but some
other yet to be determined feature such as focus and contrast discussed below in §8.3.
Compare (18) and (19). In the two examples the same noun ˀat’wąšit ‘dog’ occurs with318University of California Publications in Linguisticsthe same adjective č’al ‘white’, yet in (18) the noun phrase ˀat’wąšit č’al ‘white dog’ is not
marked with =(ˀ)a(ˀ), while in (19) the same noun phrase is marked with =(ˀ)a(ˀ).

receive core case marking in Yuki, including patient case. By contrast, the degree to
which a referent is affected by the actions of a verb is not connected with =(ˀ)a(ˀ)
marking on adjectives. Thus, although =(ˀ)a(ˀ) and the patient case enclitic =ą ~ =a look
similar, =(ˀ)a(ˀ) functions differently from patient case marking in this regard as well.
The examples below show that affectedness does not influence the use of =(ˀ)a(ˀ). In
elicitation, where a referent is not affected at all, one finds the example shown in (20)
where the noun phrase mi:li ho:ṭ ‘big deer’ is marked with =(ˀ)a(ˀ), while in (21) and (22)
where the noun phrases mil ˀunšil ‘small deer’ and ˀiyi opi ‘two (of the enemies)’ are
highly affected by the verb liˀ- ‘kill’, no =(ˀ)a(ˀ) marking is found on these noun phrases.
This is especially noteworthy in (22), as the affected referent is human.

8.2. Predicate AdjectivesPredicate adjectives can be suffixed with verb morphology and function as verbs.
Human arguments of predicate adjectives are grammatical patients. This can be seen in
Kroeber’s elicited material, as shown in (23).

These examples show some of the range of the predicate adjective in Yuki. The
meaning of hąčámmil ‘was solid’ and hač’ámt’mil ‘was firm’ is much as expected from a
predicate adjective: X is <adjective>. In (26), the meaning of hąčámečyakmil ‘made strong

"Introduction31As these later versions, especially the second version which corresponds in content
exactly to Kroeber’s original recording of Wildcat and Coyote, provide a point of
comparison and therefore a key to Kroeber’s symbols, I did the logical thing and
performed word-by-word comparisons to unlock the meaning of Kroeber’s mysterious
vowel diacritics. However, it should be noted that due to the incomplete nature of the
second version of Wildcat and Coyote, only a relatively small-scale word-to-word
comparison was possible.
My suspicion based on Kroeber’s own fragmentary description of the meaning of the
diacritics quoted above was that Kroeber was marking differences in vowel quality with
these diacritics. Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:11) note that vowels in Yuki differ in
quality depending on whether they occurred in stressed or unstressed syllables.
A perfect correspondence did not emerge between Kroeber’s use of vowel diacritics
and Uldall’s transcription. In some cases Kroeber appears to hear variants that Uldall
does not note at all. However, comparison between the different versions of the Wildcat
and Coyote myth allowed for a likely meaning, if only in a general way, to be found for
most of Kroeber’s vowel diacritics.
Kroeber’s diacritics include macrons written over single vowels or sequences of
vowels, acute accents written over vowels or more generally over syllables, grave
accents written over <o> or <i> (ò, ì), a double-underline written under <a> (a͇). Rare
symbols include <a> and <i> with circumflex (â, î) and <a>, <i>, <o>, and <u> with breve
(ă, ĭ, ŏ, ŭ) as well as nonce uses of diacritical marks with vowels where they are
generally not expected according to Kroeber’s pattern of use.
The macron most likely is an indicator of higher tone. Perceived differences in tone
have been noted in transcription of Yuki also by later researchers. Comparing Kroeber’s
original 1902 version of Wildcat and Coyote with the second version of this myth shows a
frequent correlation between syllables with macrons and syllables marked for high
tone in this later transcription. The macron does not appear to be connected with the
marking of vowel length.
It should be noted that as indicated in Kroeber’s notebooks and detailed above, at
least for a time he used <ō> to write a vowel that he perceived as having a quality
difference from other vowels34. Still, the general correspondence of the macron to34Langdon (1994:173) describes Kroeber’s transcription of Mojave and Diegueño and his use of macrons
as well as acute and grave accents. Her description supports the theory that Kroeber used macrons and
grave accents as markers of vowel quality also in Yuki: “It turns out that the macron for Kroeber means
not only length, but simultaneous “close” pronunciation, while the grave accent means the vowel is long
and “open”. Kroeber indicates stress in Mojave by the acute accent following the stressed vowel.”","[58, 59]"
"Introduction251 .6.2. Methods
The descriptions of phonetics and phonology in Chapter 2 are based on earlier studies
of Yuki phonetics and phonology and on analysis of an hour-long recording of Yuki
speaker Frank Logan27. This recording was also used for the study of the acoustic
correlates of Yuki stress in §2.2.1.3. Values for f0 or pitch, intensity, and duration were
measured in the phonetic analysis software Praat. Statistical analysis was performed
using the statistical analysis software SPSS 15.0.
For the remainder of this grammar, all analyses began with taking the texts of the
research corpus, described in §1.6.1, and retyping them in the Yuki practical
orthography, described in §1.6.5. Then the words in the texts were glossed and a
preliminary morphemic analysis was carried out. The glossing and division of words
into morphemes at this stage was based on Kroeber’s glosses of the texts in his original
notes and on earlier descriptions of Yuki and Yukian morphology, particularly those in
Kroeber 1911, Sawyer and Schlichter 1984, and Schlichter 1985. In his original notes
Kroeber provides word glosses for many, but not all, of the words in the texts. These
glosses were used as a starting point, but then were altered based on the sources given
here and my increasing facility with Yuki throughout the course of my work. The
morphemic analysis of all the words in the texts came as a result of my own work and
analysis of Yuki morphology.
At this point each proposed morpheme was studied by analyzing its use throughout
the texts28 and in elicited data. If the morpheme showed a consistent function, a
description was written with examples from the texts and elicitation. If the morpheme
did not show such a function, then it was determined whether the proposed morpheme
was itself composed of smaller morphemes with consistent functions. If no such
analysis was possible, then it was noted in the description that a morpheme had no
clearly determinable function29.
Free translations of examples from Origins and Coyote and the World are mostly taken
from Kroeber’s (1932:906-912,918-927) own published English-language version of these
texts. In comparing these English-language translations with the original Yuki texts, I
found that the 1932 free translations appeared to be sentence-by-sentence translations
of the original Yuki. In the rare case where I felt that the Yuki differed from Kroeber’s27This recording was made by James Crawford in 1953.
‘Texts” refers to the texts collected by Kroeber and Uldall in the research corpus.
29
For example, the function of the verb morphemes -ą and -lim, discussed in §7.5.9, could not be
determined.
2826University of California Publications in Linguisticstranslation, I give an alternate free translation of my own in a footnote. The free
translations for Feather Dance Narrative are my own. Ents and Upek and Ioi are originally
Chinook myths appearing in Franz Boas’ 1894 Chinook Texts. The English-language
version of these texts appears to have been given by Kroeber to Ralph Moore for
translation into Yuki. The free translations given with examples in this grammar are
those provided by Kroeber (1902e) with these two stories in his original notes.
For Chapter 3, examples were drawn from the corpus to identify the environment
governing particular morphophonemic alternations. For Chapter 15, examples of
particular types of clauses were drawn from the corpus and then described.
1 .6.3. Underlying forms
Sawyer and Schlichter’s Yuki Vocabulary contains modern transcriptions of a large
number of words spoken by Minnie Fulwider and Arthur Anderson during elicitation
sessions. Elicited forms are less likely to display sound changes, such as phonetic
reduction, characteristic of quick speech. For this reason elicited forms from Yuki
Vocabulary were generally used as the underlying forms for noun and verb roots as well
as other independent words for the morphemic analyses present throughout this
grammar. The term “modern transcription” refers to the orthography attributed to
Sawyer and Schlichter in Table 1 in §1.6.5, which is almost identical to the orthography
used in this grammar. Thus, for example, hąˀąye ‘now’ from Yuki Vocabulary is used as
the underlying form for hą́ye (OG:6) and hą́ˀye (OG:7).
For verb and noun roots or independent words not present in Yuki Vocabulary, the
underlying form is typically the same as the surface form or the more frequent form
when such a root or word occurs repeatedly in the texts. Underlying forms for noun
and verb morphology were generally left as they appeared in the data. Some preference
was at times given to the form some morphemes took in Yuki Vocabulary. For example,
the underlying form of the inchoative is given as -ląm, which is the form it takes in Yuki
Vocabulary, rather than -lam, which is the form it generally takes in the words recorded
by Kroeber.
In some cases suffixes may have had differing forms, but there was good reason to
pick one form over the other as the underlying form. For example, for the past tense
suffix -wi ~ -u it was clear from the description of Yuki in Kroeber (1911) as well as
analysis of the behavior of this suffix in the texts in Appendix 10 that -wi and -u were
indeed two forms of the same suffix. As -wi appeared to be a fuller form of this suffix, itIntroduction27was selected as the underlying form. Therefore, the final morpheme in nąnákwi ‘knew’
and tíweyu ‘pursued’ (both from CW:177) is given as -wi when analyzed.
When in the course of the research for this grammar a phonological process was
observed further highlighting the nature of underlying forms, this observation was
taken into account in order to refine underlying forms. For example, as discussed in
§2.1.1.8.8.1, root-final glottalization and root-final glottal stops will often spread to the
preceding vowel resulting in a VʔV sequence. This VʔV sequence is often observed in
verbs containing the root wok’- ‘sing, dance’. In Sawyer and Schlichter (1984) this root is
given without final glottalization as wok. However, given that VʔV and even root-final
glottalization is seen in verbs with this root, such as wóˀoksikiṭ ‘while dancing’ (CW:135)
and wáˀok’esmil ‘(they) danced’ (FD:21), it seemed likely that the underlying form of this
root ended in an ejective. For this reason it is given as wok’ in this grammar.
Occasionally, one encounters sporadic glottalization or glottal stops for reasons
which are not known. An aspect of this phenomenon is discussed in §2.1.1.8.2. At this
point this phenomenon does not seem to be linked to any difference in meaning and
may have been characteristic of a style of speaking in Yuki. It is encountered both in
the speech of Frank Logan, as in miṭóˀk ‘joints’, and Ralph Moore, as in hoč’k ‘is big’
(Kroeber 1901a:37), šą́:kč’am ‘sometimes’ (FD:22), and hą́lamuˀ ‘just heard’ (CW:18). These
segments are not included in the morphemic analysis line or underlying forms.
Similarly, as discussed in §3.4, the insertion of epenthetic [i] or [e] is common in
Yuki. These vowels also are not included in the morphemic analysis line or in
underlying forms.
1 .6.4. Consultants and other sources
Ralph Moore (ca. 1874/1875 - 19??) was born on the Round Valley Indian Reservation
and went on to become Alfred Kroeber’s primary Yuki language consultant for the
decades of Kroeber’s work with Yuki. Kroeber records Moore’s Yuki name as Ašíːyam
Nána’ak30. In his work with Kroeber, Moore said early on that he mainly spoke as an
Uk’omnom’, but then in later years said that he actually spoke as a Wit’ukomnom’,
adding that more specifically he spoke like the people of Olkat village, located at the
head of Eden Valley. Kroeber also records Moore as also having known Ta’nom’, due to
the fact that Moore’s mother was Ta’nom’ (Kroeber 1931-1932/1958).","[52, 53, 54, 55]"

"Figure 1: The Yukian Language Family
Beyond its relationship to Wappo, more distant genetic relationships for Yuki have
also been posited (Mithun 1999:310, 574). Sapir (1929) incorporated Yuki and Wappo as
a separate branch into Hokan-Siouan, Elmendorf (1963, 1964) felt that Yuki and Wappo
displayed similarities to Siouan and Yuchi, and the possibility of a relationship betweenIntroduction5Yuki, Wappo, and Yuchi has also been discussed from time to time by other linguists
(Munro 1994, Golla 1996a).
1 .1.2. Location
The Northern Yukian languages were spoken in three ecologically distinct regions
located within present-day Mendocino County in Northern California. Yuki was spoken
in the inland Round Valley area, which is located in the Coast Range mountains and
bounded on three sides by tributaries of the Eel River (Miller 1979:9). Huchnom was
spoken to the southwest of the Yuki speech area. The Huchnom lived along the
drainage of the South Eel River within a heavily forested and mountainous area
(Kroeber 1925 [1976]:202). Coast Yuki was spoken to the west of both of these areas on
the Pacific coast. Most Coast Yuki settlements were on or near the coast itself beginning
a short distance north of Fort Bragg and extending up along the sea to an area a few
miles north of Rockport (Miller 1978:249)3.
1.1.3. Identity
Prior to contact with Euro-Americans, the Yuki divided themselves into villages, also
called rancherias, which were led by a local chief. Groups of villages formed a tribelet
that was centered on a single large village, called a no’hot ‘to live big,’ containing a
dance house and the residence of the chief of the tribelet4 (Miller 1978:250, Foster
1944:157).
Speakers of Yuki identified themselves with respect to one of several tribal
subdivisions. Foster (1944:157) states that in pre-contact times, the Yuki recognized six
major subdivisions, which were characterized by minor linguistic differences. These six
tribal subdivisions were: Ta’nom’, Ukomnom’, Huitítnom’, Witukomnom’,
Onkolukomnom,’ and Sukšaltatamnom’5. Two further minor subdivisions are also
recorded immediately to the south of the Ukomnom’. These were the Laikutnom’ and
Ontitnom’6 (Miller 1978:249). Huchnom tribal subdivisions are not known, though the
3See Appendix 1 for a map showing the area in which the Northern Yukian languages were spoken
relative to natural and manmade landmarks.

See Appendix 2 for a map of villages within the Northern Yukian speech area.

Yuki nom’ ‘people’ was also used in Yuki names for neighboring non-Yuki-speaking peoples. It was also
commonly affixed to placenames “to indicate affiliation with a place or group (Foster 1944:157).
6
Foster (1944:157) gives this description of the tribal subdivisions: “The grouping is not to be thought of
as we think of city, county, and state; these concepts are far too precise. Rather, it is in the sense that we6University of California Publications in Linguisticsdistribution of Coast Yuki tribelets is recorded by Barrett (1908:262-3) and Gifford7
(1965:5-13).
Since a unified Yuki tribal identity did not exist in pre-contact times, there also did
not exist a name for the Yuki people as a whole in the Northern Yukian languages.
Indeed, Kroeber (1925 [1976]:166) notes that the use of “Yuki” as the ethnonym for the
group of people we today refer to as the Yuki is a Euro-American innovation rather
than a practice that existed beforehand. The term “Yuki” originates in Wintu, where
the word yuˑki refers to strangers or enemies.
1.1.4. Dialects
A limited amount is known about dialect divisions within Yuki. Nothing is known about
the dialects of Coast Yuki or Huchnom. Within Yuki there existed dialect differences
among some tribal subdivisions. Kroeber (1925 [1976]:166) writes:
There are dialectic divergences within the area of the Yuki proper. The speech
of the Ta’no’m, Ukomno’m and Witukomno’m differs. The Utitno’m dialect
classed with the Witukomno’m, the Lilshikno’m probably with the Ta’no’m, the
group including the Suk’ano’m may have leaned either to Ukomno’m or
Witukomno’m, while the affiliations of the three eastern divisions of
mountaineers are not known. All the dialects were mutually intelligible, but
apparently different enough for any Yuki to recognize the approximate
provenience of another.
By the beginning of the twentieth century, when Kroeber began his work on Yuki, it
seems that dialect differences had largely been lost among Yuki speakers. He observes
that as a result of English-language schooling, Native American children from Round
Valley would often lose their parents’ language or if they continued to speak it,
differences between dialects were probably getting “blurred out” (Kroeber 19311932/1958). Foster (1944:161) gives this account of the nature of Yuki dialectsay ‘I am a Middle Westerner,’ ‘I am a Southerner,’ or ‘I am a New Englander,’ and differences in speech
were probably about as marked. But instead of a national governmental organization for the whole area,
the Yuki had only consciousness of kind to bind them together.”

Coyote to catch, but, as always, dd not himself eat. Also he caused his own
brother to stand at the (north) end of the world in summer, his sister in
winter. After other acts, he went to the sky with his two sons.’]Appendix 10: Yuki Texts (Coyote and the World)5212 . COYOTE AND THE WORLD
In 1902, Coyote and the World was told by Ralph Moore and recorded by Alfred Kroeber
(1902b, 1902d). Kroeber calls this text the Coyote myth in his original notes, but later
calls it Coyote and the World in his (1932) published English translations of the myths that
were told to him by Ralph Moore. The English free translations of this myth are taken
from one of these translations (Kroeber 1932:918-927). In comparing the original Yuki
recorded in Kroeber’s notes with the translations, it quickly became apparent that the
1932 free translations of Origins and Coyote and the World were sentence-by-sentence
translations of the original Yuki. The free translations are largely unaltered from
Kroeber’s original. In rare cases small alterations were made when a translation for a
particular sentence did not match the original Yuki as well as it could have. Material
which was present in the English translation, but not in the original Yuki, either
because of missing pages or other unknown reasons, is given in square brackets. The
numbering of the clauses is kept consistent with Kroeber’s own numbering in his
original notes. Therefore, this text begins with clause (6). (6) - (91) are recorded in
Notebook 29 (Kroeber 1902b). (92) - (423) are recorded in Notebook 31 (Kroeber 1902d).
In some cases Kroeber notes alternate forms. These are given as footnotes in this
version. Unless otherwise indicated, the translations of these alternate forms are taken
from the glosses provided by Kroeber in his original notes.","[547, 548, 549]"

Relative clauses are formed in Yuki by attaching the dependent clause marker =namli to
the verb along with a morpheme identical to the third-person pronoun/demonstrative
kiˀ or one of its derived forms. An alternative method is to attach =kiˀ or one of its
derived forms directly to the verb. The =kiˀ morphemes found in both types of relative
clause refer to a particular noun or pronoun in the main clause. The difference between
these two relative clause types is unclear. The enclitics used to form relative clauses are
shown in Table 38. In the examples in this section, the relative clause is underlined and
the head noun is given in bold.

"468University of California Publications in Linguistics1 . ORIGINS
Recorded in 1902, Alfred Kroeber (1902b) writes that this myth was told to him by
Ralph Moore, but that Moore had been taught the myth by a Yuki speaker named
Diddle, who was “recognized as the old man who best knew it [this myth].” In these
notes, Kroeber calls this the Taikomol myth, but later calls it Origins in his (1932)
published English translations of the myths that were told to him by Ralph Moore. The
English free translations of this myth are taken from one of these translations (Kroeber
1932:906-912).
In comparing the original Yuki recorded in Kroeber’s notes with the translations, it
quickly became apparent that the 1932 free translations of Origins and Coyote and the
World were sentence-by-sentence translations of the original Yuki. The free
translations are largely unaltered from Kroeber’s original. In rare cases alterations
were made when a translation for a particular sentence did not seem to match the
original Yuki as well as it could have. Material present in the English translation, but
not in the original Yuki, either because of missing pages or other unknown reasons, is
given in square brackets. Origins is recorded in Notebook 29 (Kroeber 1902b). In some
cases Kroeber notes alternate forms. These are given as footnotes in this version.
Unless otherwise indicated, the translations of these alternate forms are taken from the
glosses provided by Kroeber in his original notes.","[495, 496]"
"56University of California Publications in LinguisticsPhonologically, diphthongs are analyzable as VC sequences. The reasoning for this is
the CV(Cα)(Cβ) shape of the he Yuki canonical syllable. As there are no phonemic long
vowels, there is no basis to suggest that there exists a class of syllables that have an
alternate shape, such as CVV. Thus the most parsimonious analysis is to consider the [j]
and [w] off-glides and to analyze syllables containing diphthongs as CVC.
2 .1.2.2.5. Minimal Pairs
The examples in (29) illustrate the contrast among the five phonemic vowels in wordinitial position. As in many languages, word-initial vowels are preceded by an
epenthetic glottal stop.
