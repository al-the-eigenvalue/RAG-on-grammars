Interrogative Sentences
There are two types of questions: one type applies a question word (wh-questions), while the other type does not (polar questions). The following types of
interrogative markers have been identified: special intonation, verbal inflection
and a special interrogative verb. The word order does not play a fundamental
role. If an interrogative sentence contains a verb, the verb obligatory takes the
interrogative mood marker. The interrogative mood suffixes are different in different tenses. (For more on the interrogative mood see Section 5.5 in Chapter 5.)
Verbless interrogative sentences are marked only by intonation.
2.2.1
Polar Question
Yes-no or polar questions do not require special word order. The word order
is usually the same as in the declarative sentence, but the order of elements380chapter 10is determined by the information structure. The verb can even move to the
first position of the clause or sentence, if it is emphasized, as in example (38b).
The subject is normally covert in this sentence type, but if it is emphasized it
appears in the sentence.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.123Verbless interrogative sentences have a high-pitch intonation pattern, the tone
peek being higher than that of an affirmative sentence. The following sentences
illustrate a fragment from a dialogue. There are two speakers, KH and KNT. Sentence (39a) contains a verb, but sentences (39c–d) are verbless.

KH-KNT_960810_Ngindjili_conv.046In the negative polar question, the negative auxiliary ńisɨ (40a), the negative
existential particle ďaŋku (41a), or the negative existential verb ďaŋgujsʲa can
be used. It can be answered with the negative existential particle ďaŋku, however in most cases, the conjugated forms of the negative auxiliary are employed.

Wh-Question
In a wh-question, the question word replaces the questioned constituent. Any
sentence constituent can be the focus of a wh-question. It is possible to ask for
person, thing, place, time, manner etc. Question words are listed in Section 4.4
in Chapter 3. The following sentences illustrate questioned NPs, such as numerals (44a), adjectives (44b), and possessors in possessive NP (44c).

KECh_080214_EvilSpirit_flkd.017A question word usually occupies the first position in a sentence; however, this
is not compulsory. Nganasan is a so-called in-situ language. It means that the
question word remains in the position, in which a non-question word (answer)
with the same grammatical function will be located. Thus, the syntactic function and the information status determines the position of the question word.
However, the question word always takes the position before the predicate (Wh
X V order). Sentences (45a–c) are examples of a sentence with a question word
in the sentence initial position. It must be noted that all question words in
sentences (45a–c) can also take the sentence internal position as sentences
(46a–c) portray.

KH-KNT_960810_Ngindjili_conv.043Multiple question constructions occur as well. These are built from two or more
simultaneously used wh-words. In this case, the speaker asks for two NPs. There
are some preferences according to ordering of question words: interrogatives
with reference to human entity preferably precedes interrogatives with nonhuman reference. Wh-word questioning location or manner usually follows
question words referring to human object or other non-human objects.

PKK_71_Djajku_flkd.1042.2.3
Other Questions Types
Similar to some Siberian languages such as Evenki, Tuvin, Nenets etc., there
is a special interrogative verb which cannot be used in a declarative sentence:
kumun-sa ‘say what; tell what’. The verb is historically formed from the interrogative stem ku- and the verb mun-sa ‘say’ and has a regular morphology. This verb
normally takes the interrogative marker as in kumuŋu, the interogtaive future
as in kumuntəŋu ~ kumunsuðə- or the interrogative iterative as in kumuŋkəə.
There are very few examples for dubitative and reportative interogative forms
as well. The verb can be negated with the negative auxiliary, has participial
forms and can take derivational suffixes such as passive and habituative. Question words are always missing from such sentences. The following sentences
show the usage of this verb.

ChNS_080214_Hibula.flkd.058Echo-questions are not typical for Nganasan texts, there are only very few
examples for this type. They are used, if the speaker has some doubts. Structurally, echo-questions are like polar questions. The following sentences illustrates this type. The second sentence is an example of an echo-question. As the
sentences show, the asked constituent is marked by an emphatic element.

Emphatic Use of Interrogative Sentences
The emphatic use of a question is typical for all Northern Samoyedic language
(Nenets, Enets and Nganasan). In this sentence type the interrogative form of
the negative auxiliary appears. This kind of sentence can express rhetorical
questions (52a), simple assertions, and assertions deduced from the context
(52b). The word order is the same as in the simple negated construction, thus
the auxiliary precedes the main verb.

Imperative Sentences
2.3.1
Positive Imperative
The imperative has its own marker in all personal forms (including the firstperson singular); but the most common form is the second person singular
form. The tense of the imperative sentences is usually the aorist (i.e. immediate future), it cannot be the past, but there are separate forms for future as
well. (For more about the personal markers see Section 5.2, Chapter 5.)
The verb of the predicate in the imperative sentence typically takes the sentence-final position, thus the word order in an imperative sentence is the same
as in a declarative sentence. The subject is not present in imperative sentences.

Prohibition
The negative imperative is expressed with the imperative form of the standard
negative auxiliary (ńi-sɨ). The negative auxiliary in a prohibitive sentence takes
the same imperative ending as the main verb in the positive imperative sentence. The imperative form of the auxiliary and the connegative of the main
verb together express prohibition. The negative auxiliary must precede the
main verb. In sum, the prohibitive structure uses the standard negative element
and the standard imperative strategy.

TNK, 2008The interrogative word maa ‘what’ or maaŋuna ‘what for’ is used for nonhuman animate (animals) and non-human inanimate (things). In some cases,
maa can occur in an attributive position, as sentence (70b) demonstrates.

KNT_940903_KehyLuu.118In special cases, the interrogative word ‘what’ can also be used for a human referent. This happens, when the person asking the question wants to find out the
other person’s clan affiliation. Clan names can be animal names or names of
things (e.g. hu͡aləə ‘belonging to stone’). The pair of sentences in (71) provides
an example of such a question and the answer given.

KES-SEN_031114_Dialog_conv.012There are local case-marked interrogative forms. The locative form of interrogative maa ‘what’ is generally used to ask about the instrument (72).

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.124Several emphatic forms of the question words also exist, after which the limitative suffix is followed by emphatic suffixes—most often -güə—as in maaraagüə
‘only what’. The limitative forms of maa ‘what’ are often used: maa-raa-Ɂ ‘whatlim-pl’ maa-raa-j ‘what-lim-acc.pl’. The limitative form of the interrogative
can be used as an indefinite pronoun as well. For indefinites see Section 4.5
below.

ChNS_080214_Wandering_nar.024There are two lexemes that mean ‘why’. Both are formed from the interrogative
pronoun maa ‘what’. One is mаа-ðə-(poss), in which the stem maa is followed
by the elative adverbial suffix (cf. Section 5 below), which is optionally followed
by a possessive suffix, mostly in the second person form. Another form of the
question word ‘why’ is maaďa, which is the lexicalized form of the interrogative
pronoun maa ‘what’ followed by the allative postposition ďa. No data clarifies
whether these two lexemes can be used interchangeably. It seems that maaďa
is more frequent than the interrogative form maaðǝ-. The following sentences
show the use of these words.

KES_080721_Disease_flkd.021If the maa ‘what’ is used together with the copula, it expresses the meaning of

the infinitive form of the copula, which is followed by a finite form of the verb.

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.015The interrogatives for local cases are polymorphemic; they are based on the
interrogative stem ku-, which is of Proto-Samoyedic origin. Normally, they contain one of the ancient case endings which appear on adverbs of place. Usually, no further suffixes are attached to these words. These interrogatives have
only singular forms. The forms of the interrogatives for local cases are given in

TKF_061105_MasterOfIdols_flk.763The question word ‘where’ has three forms, kunini, kunu and kunuŋu. The form
kunu is composed of the interrogative word ku- and the adverbial locative suffix -nu (for adverbial endings, see Section 5 below), but this form is very rare
(80). The form kunuŋu is formed from the ku-nu question word and the interrogative marker -ŋu (cf. Section 5.5 in Chapter 5). The form kunuŋu agrees in
number with the subject, as sentences (81a–b) shows. The form kunini is also
used, which is composed of the pronominal stem ku- (82). The following sentence shows the use of these question words.

This chapter discusses the characteristics of nominal categories and provides
an overview of the inflectional classes. The Northern Samoyedic languages
display highly flectional morphological characteristics concerning case and
numeral suffixes: these are always portmanteau morphemes.
The following grammatical categories are present in the inflection of nouns:
number, case, and possessive personal suffixation. There is no grammatical
gender, and the animate/inanimate contrast also does not have grammatical
correlates. The linear order of inflectional morphemes is as follows:
Singular: base+(derivational suffix)+(destinative suffix)+case/possessive
marker
Dual:
base+(derivational suffix)+(destinative suffix)+dual marker+case/
possessive marker
Plural:
base+(derivational suffix)+complex case, number and possessive
marker1Stems and Their FormationThe present section discusses what kind of stems suffixes attach to. Morphemes
(both stems and suffixes) may have an extreme number of allomorphs, far
more than is usual in other Uralic languages. The stems are grouped according
to their morphophonological alternations. Stem morphemes appear in three
forms, called S1, S2, S3 stems.
(a) The S1 stem is identical to the nominative singular form of the noun. This
stem type is not characterized by alternations.
(b) The S2 stem is identical to the genitive/accusative singular form of the
word. It can be also derived from the plural nominative form by deleting the
glottal stop. If the base word ends in a consonant, the stem is augmented with
an epenthetic vowel -ə. The harmonic class of the stem (see Section 7.2 in
Chapter 2) is irrelevant for the formation of S2 stems. If the word contains a
consonant involved in gradation, it occurs in the weak grade in the S2 stem—
a fact that can be explained by the historic genitive marker -ŋ, which has been
lost, but retains its presence in the form of an empty slot word-finally. The last
syllable of the genitive form is thus, always closed, allowing gradation to happen. (For the rules of gradation, see Section 7.1 in Chapter 2.)
© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_005177nominal inflectionThe S1 and S2 stem of vowel-final stems are often identical. Exceptions are
those cases in which a gradation consonant is present in the stem, which
appears in the syllabic weak grade in S2 stems.
(c) The S3 stem is formed from the genitive plural form by removing the case
suffix -Ɂ from vowel-final stems. If the stem ends in a consonant, the S3 stem
gains a connecting vowel, following the suffix harmony rules (e.g. -U: -u/ -ɨ/
-ü/-i). The stem-final vowel in S3 stems is often different from the vowel of S1/S2
stems. Gradation affects gradation consonants in the same way as it does in S2
stem. In the sections below, the different stem types are described in detail. The
following listing gives only the typical stem types:

Vowel-Final Stems
Stems ending in a vowel exhibit two kinds of alternation: consonant gradation
and vowel alternation. In some cases, no change occurs in the stem, i.e. the
form of all three stems is the same, but the most frequent case is that S1 and
S2 are the same, and the stem-final vowel in the S3 stem changes. Usually no
vowel alternation appears in stems ending in -i, -ɨ or a diphthong -ɨ͡a, -i͡a, -u͡a, or
-ü ͡a. Words ending in u- usually alternate, but sometimes the alternation does
not happen. Words with [+backness] value ending in -a usually do not alternate, while words with [-backness] value do. The list below includes words in
which the three stems are the same, meaning, neither vowel alternation nor
consonant gradation occurs in them.","[192, 193, 194, 195, 196]"

Negative Purposive Clause
Negative clauses of purpose are created by the negative supine form of the
main verb of the sub-clause, with the ending -mUŋkətə + (possessive suffix).
The nominal phrase typically appears at the beginning of the clause. If the
subject of the main clause and the subordinate clause are not the same, the
subject of the subordinate clause is either expressed by a possessive suffix on
the supine form, or by a nominal category in the genitive, or by both means, as
in sentences (32a–b).

Negative Questions and Their Affirmative Use
In negative questions, the negative auxiliary takes the appropriate inflections
and the main verb follows it in its connegative form. The question is mostly
dedicated to future and the negative auxiliary takes only the future marker as
in (34a). If the sentence is possessive or existential, the negative existential verb
ďaŋgujsʲa appears in its interrogative form, but it can use the negative existential particle ďaŋku as well. The sentence can express a real question or only provide emphasis. The negative element remains at the beginning of the sentence.

TNK, 2008The other type of negative question is not a real question; it is only used to
emphasize something. In such sentences, the negative auxiliary takes the interrogative marker, but keeps its sentence-final position together with the main
verb (SOAuxV structure). This sentence structure can never be interpreted as
a real question. Note that although the sentences below are syntactically negative, the meaning is positive.

Negative Lexical Words
There are some inherently negative lexical verbs and particles which are presented in Table 12.3.
The most frequent verb with a negative lexical meaning is ďerusa ‘not know’.
The positive conterpart of this verb is čenɨďi ‘know’. The following sentence pair
shows how the positive and negative verbs are used. The sentences below illustrate that the structure is not symmetric; negation is not simply expressed by
the insertion of a negative element into the sentence, but in the negative sentence the negative lexical element appears.","[441, 442, 443, 444]"

The interrogative mood is employed for both question types: constituent and
yes-no questions. If there is no verb in the sentence—as in the sentences
below—, the only marker indicating the interrogative mood is intonation: a

TKF, 19993Sensory EvidentialityThe auditive/sensitive forms are used when talking about events that the speaker has heard or has felt in some way, thus the evidence is based on auditory or
sensory evidence. There are two auditory/sensory markers (cf. Section 6.6, in
Chapter 5). In present day Nganasan there is no difference between the usages
of the two forms. It seems, however, that the adverbial form (-mUnǝɁ) is more
ancient and is presently only seldom used. The usage of the adverbial structure
is extremely rare, only 1% of all auditive forms have this form, but it was found
in recorded productions from 5 different speakers.
Auditive/sensitive forms can be used in interrogative sentences, in which the
interrogative marker is missing. Only the presence of the question word marks
the interrogative. In the examples below, the adverbial auditive is used.

Genitive Case
The main function of the genitive case is to mark the non-pronominal possessor in an adnominal possessive construction, as in (30). As mentioned in
Section 3.4.1, the pronominal possessor stands in the nominative case. Possessive costructions are discussed more in detail in Section 4.2 of Chapter 8.
Additionally, the genitive form in noun phrases serves as the subject of nonfinite clauses (see Section 3. in Chapter 13). Furthermore, the plural genitive
ending forms adverbs of manner and time (see Section 6, Chapter 3), the object
of postposition takes also the genitive.

Lative/Dative Case
The basic function of the lative/dative is to express the direction of movement or transport into something (semantic role Goal), e.g. the lative is used
to answer the question ‘(in)to where?’. Verbs referring to the beginning of a stative action (e.g. ‘fall asleep’, ‘arrive’, ‘die’ etc.) often, but not obligatorily, require
the lative case (cf. sentence 31b).

KNT, 1996nominal inflection197The lative case can also express a dative meaning, i.e. the Recipient-argument and the beneficiary of a ditransitive construction is marked by the lative.
However, the recipient-like argument that accompanies the verbs ‘say’ and ‘tell’
is not marked by the lative, but by the postposition ďa. (This construction will
be described in more detail in Chapter 11.) The construction involving the lative
is illustrated by the following example.

3.4.5
Locative/Instrumental Case
Nouns in the locative case are used to answer the question ‘inside what?
where?’, thus encoding spatial location, as in sentence (34). Similar to Nenets
and Enets, noun phrases with the instrument semantic role, and the mean of
the transport are also expressed by locative. A noun in the locative case can

case, however, the base is a nominal expressing a point in time such as, kičəðəə

Inferential
The inferential mood can denote evidential meaning: if the speaker does not
witness the event or action s/he is speaking about, but the circumstances suggest the event is taking place and the speaker is fairly certain that the event
took place, the inferential form is used. This mood, however, is more frequently
used to express an admirative meaning: surprise, doubt, uncertainty, irony or
sarcasm. The marker of this mood is attached to the S1 stem. The inferential has
only one temporal form, the aorist and two mood markers, one for subjective
and objective conjugations for one or two objects, and another for reflexive and
objective conjugations for more than two objects. Table 5.11 exhibits the mood
markers.
The following example shows the usage of the inferential mood expressing
evidentiality.","[267, 268, 269]"

Tereshchenko 1979: 262There is a negative discourse particle (sɨlʲiɁi͡a ~ sɨlʲiɁi͡aɁ ~ sɨlʲiɁi͡aðǝ) which

In complex sentences, two or maybe more predicative relations are expressed,
which in European languages usually relate to a syntactic connecting element (for example with a conjunction or relative pronoun etc.). Like in other
Samoyedic and Siberian languages, true complex sentences are not characteristic for Nganasan, they are quite rare. Meanings expressed by a subordinate
clause in English for example, are mainly expressed by non-finite verb forms
(e.g. participles or converb construction).
This chapter provides an overview of the common features of the traditional
clause combining strategies such as coordination and subordination. In coordinated clauses, the clauses are linked together which have the same function and
are syntactically not dependent one on another. In contrast with coordinated
clauses, subordinated clauses depend on the main (matrix) clause and they
function as a constituent. There are several types of subordinate clauses: complement clauses, adverbial clauses, and relative clauses. Section 1 deals with
coordination, complementation is presented in Section 2, Section 3 describes
the adverbial clauses, while Section 4 gives an overview of the relativization
strategies.","[445, 446, 447, 448]"

JDH_00_Fosterling_flkd.122The forms ǝmǝ, tǝndǝ (the genitive form of ǝmtɨ and tǝti) and tǝǝ occur in lexicalized forms as well, in which they cannot be interchanged. The form ǝmti

TKF_061105_FoxFosterling_flk.384As depicted in Section 2, Chapter 8, both əmtɨ and əmə ‘this’ can occur as an
attributive modifier in the NP, thus, they behave syntactically as pro-adjectives.
In this function, they always precede the head noun. Similar to adjectives, they
concur with their head in number and case only partly, never being marked
for local cases. When the head is marked for local case, the demonstrative is
marked for genitive. The same is true of the forms tǝǝ and tǝti. At the same time,
only ǝmtɨ, tǝti and tǝsɨǝ, and more rarely, forms marked for emphatic clitics can
bear possessive suffixes. The forms with possessive suffixes occur only as free
standing pronominals, in which cases they do not express real possession, but
rather anaphoric reference. For more on this, see Section 2.1 Chapter 14.
4.3
Intensifiers
Intensifiers are formed from the pronominal stem ŋonə- ‘-self’ with the help of
oblique forms of possessive suffixes. Person and number are marked by these
suffixes. This pronoun does not however have a reflexive meaning. It is used to130chapter 3express additional emphasis or emotional context. Reflexive meaning is covered by the words hütəðə ‘body’, ńa ‘companion’ and sɨɁ ‘image’ with possessive
suffixes (cf. sentences (15a–b–c)) above. The intensifier with the stem ŋonǝcannot be inflected further; the missing forms are expressed with the help of
postpositions.

Question Words
Quention words are used in wh-questions (content questions). They can be
classified according to the type of information they seek, and also according
to inflectional properties. Part of them shares the morphosyntactical properties with nouns, another part with adverbs. The group of declinable interrogatives can take number markers, the destinative suffix and possessive suffixes,131word classessuch as ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘what kind of’, ‘which’ and ‘how many’. The interrogatives
maaŋuna ‘what for’ and sɨlɨŋuna ‘who for’ bare only number markers and they
can be followed by verbal suffixes as well. The word maaŋuna can be used
also with meaning ‘what kind of’ (cf. sentence (43b) in Section 2.2.2 of Chapter 10). Interrogatives that behave like adverb are morphologically unchangeable, maaďa ‘why’. Additionally, there is a question verb kumunsa ‘say what’1
(cf. Section 2.2.3 in Chapter 10). The following chart shows the most important
question words.

kunini ‘where’
kunuŋu ‘where’To reference humans, the question words sɨlɨ ‘who’ and sɨlɨŋuna ‘who for’ are
used. The interrogative sɨlɨŋuna ‘who for’ is the emphatic form of sɨlɨ like Hungarian kicsoda ‘what for’. Interrogatives ‘who’, ‘who for’ and ‘what for’ often stay
in the predicate position, in this case, they have non-referential use. This is
demonstrated by the following sentences.

Nenets the form Nenets xaɁman- is postulated. (See Nikolaeva 2014: 265.)132chapter 3Question words can take dual and plural endings and case suffixes. The destinative forms have a benefactive function, which is discussed in more detail
in Section 2, Chapter 11. Although the sɨlɨ interrogative can take a possessive
suffix, it does not express a possessive relation, rather a question about which
person out of a given group did something, cf. sentence (67c).

of the sentence has a present reference. Past meaning can be expressed by
the past participle form of the main verb, followed by the conjugated copula

MVL_09ß007_Hungabtadja_flks.671The verb ŋuðasa ‘own’ also expresses possession. This verb can be used to
express an inalienable possessive relation. The relation between the possessor
and the possessed is stable in time and the possessor controls the relation, i.e.
[+stable time] and [+control] features can be associated with this relation. The
possessor functions as the subject, while the possessed is the direct object in
the accusative. This structure emphasizes the existence of the possessive relation. Such sentences are considerably rarer than the previous type; there is only
one example for this construction in the corpus. The following two sentences

Sentences are generally grouped into two categories according to the way in
which the relationship to the predicate is expressed namely: simple or complex sentences. This chapter deals with simple sentences.
The syntax of Nganasan has not been thoroughly explored. There are only
few works that have dealt with syntactic problems. In her monographic work
dedicated to the syntax of Samoyedic languages (1973), Tereschenko only enumerates the types of sentences which exist. In a grammar of Nganasan by the
same author (1979), semantic and syntactic issues are not considered at all. The
summary below highlights and discusses the most important questions, but it
is not an exhaustive account.
Nganasan is a head-final SOV language; however, head-finality is not rigid.
Word order is basically determined by the information structure of the sentence (for more detail see in Chapter 14). Head-finality is obligatory in phrases
containing a noun, such as possessive phrases (head: noun) and postpositional
phrases (head: postposition). Contrarily, in attributive phrases the adjective
can follow the head noun (cf. Section 1 in Chapter 8). Question words tend to
appear at the beginning of the sentence, but they sometimes occur in a more
internal position (see Section 2.2.2 below).
The most important grammatical relations are easily discovered in a sentence, as these are morphologically marked. An overt subject is not a compulsory element of a sentence; according to Holmberg’s terminology (2005)
Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language. There are no general pronouns
(like one in English or si in Italian) in Nganasan.
Nganasan is an accusative-nominative language, as the unmarked element
in an active sentence is the subject and the agent. However, the object may be
unmarked as well, if it is in a third person pronoun as the inflectional suffixes
can refer to a third person object. Thus Nganasan in not only a subject prodrop, but also an object pro-drop language. The personal pronouns have the
same form in the role of an object and subject. (For information about the flexion of personal pronouns see Section 4.1 in Chapter 3, for object marking see
Section 1.2 below).© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_011364
1chapter 10Clause Participant and Grammatical Relations in SentencesThis section describes the basic grammatical relations in a sentence, with special emphasis on case marking. The subject and the object can be indentified
by a number of criteria, wich are discussed below.
1.1
Subject
As stated above, Nganasan belongs to the nominative–accusative languages.
Therefore, the overt subject of an intransitive and a transitive active sentence
gets the same case marker, namely the nominative case in clauses with finite
verb and with non-verbal predicate as well. There is no distinction between an
agentive and a non-agentive subject or human and non-human subject. The
predicate must agree in person and number with the subject (see Section 1.1.1
below). The grammatical subject of the sentence tends to appear in the sentence initial position, but adverbs and question words can precede it. Typical
subjects are expressed by a nominal phrase, which is composed of a modified
noun (1a), a simple noun, (1b) or a pronoun (1c).

Source: Based on Janhunen 1998: 4592The Language2.1
Nganasan in the Uralic Language Family
Nganasan belongs to the Samoyedic branch of the Uralic language family. Geographically, Samoyedic languages can be divided into two major groups: Northern Samoyedic and Southern Samoyedic. The Northern Samoyedic languages
are represented by Nenets, Enets and Nganasan, and to the Southern branch
belong Selkup, †Kamas and †Mator. People belonging to the Northern branch
live in the Northern tundra area of Siberia. The Selkups live south of them, in
the taiga area, and the extinct Mator and Kamas lived around the Sayan Mountains. All the dialects of Mator—Mator, Taigi and Karagas—became extinct in
the first half of the 19th century. The Kamas language was spoken until the
1980s. Therefore, today only four Samoyedic languages are spoken: Selkup and
the three Northern Samoyedic languages.
Samoyedic languages branched off from the Uralic family approximately
four thousand years BC. The unity of the language persisted for four thousand
years, i.e. the daughter languages departed from each other two thousand years
ago. Figure 1.2 shows the traditional taxonomy of Samoyedic languages which
also takes the geographical positions into consideration. From a geographical
point of view, it is expedient to differentiate between Northern and Southern Samoyedic languages; however, this doesn’t reflect the genetic relationship
between the daughter languages.
Figure 1.3 below shows Janhunen’s alternative genetic relations inside the
Samoyedic branch, in which Nganasan has an own sub-branch.
2.2
Dialects
Two dialects are distinguished, which do not differ significantly from each
other. Most speakers, almost 75 percent of Nganasan, use the Avam dialect,
which is primarily spoken in the western part of the Taimyr Peninsula. There15introductionProto-SamoyedicNganasanEnetsNenetsSelkupKamasMatorfigure 1.3 The alternative taxonomy of the Samoyedic languages
Source: Janhunen 1998: 459are two sub-dialects of the Avam dialect: Pyasina Avam, spoken in Usť-Avam
and Volochanka, and Taimyr Avam which is now only spoken in Volochanka.
Most descriptions are based on data from the Pyasina Avam sub-dialect. Speakers living on the eastern side of the peninsula use the Vadeyev dialect. There are
no differences between women’s Nganasan and men’s Nganasan.
Dialectal differences are typically phonetic and lexical. Research has only
revealed very few morphological differences between dialects, however it must
be pointed out that this aspect of Nganasan has not been studied in depth. In
the Pyasina sub-dialect, after the first person imperative form the ending -ðəm
is used while in the Taimyr dialect (mostly spoken in Volochanka) the ending of
the reflexive conjugation (-nə) is used. Compare the examples: huulʲə-ku-ðəm
vs. huu-lʲə-ku-nə [look.for-inch-imp-imp.1sg vs. look.for-inch-imp-1sg.rfl]
‘let me look for’. (For imperative see Section 5.2 in Chapter 5). Table 1.2 below
illustrates the phonetic and lexical differences of the dialects.
2.3
Sociolinguistic Situation
The number of Nganasan has remained relatively constant over time. Considerable population decreases have occurred only due to the smallpox epidemics
(in the mid-1700s, around 1830s and at the beginning of the 20th century).
The Avam tribe of Nganasan has always been the more populous tribe. Therefore, the estimated total number of Nganasans is based on their number. The
evolution of the number of Avam Nganasans across the centuries (based on
Krivogonov 1998: 239) is as follows:
Year
1700 1761 1796 1832 1900 1917
Population 872 475 837 344 663 334
It must be noted, however, that the data recorded before the Soviet era cannot be regarded as exact. The data demonstrate that the number of Nganasans
has probably never exceeded a few thousands. However, looking solely at the
numbers can lead one to draw false conclusions. Data recorded during the16

For instance,
in Ust’-Avam Enets individuals or children of Enets–Nganasan mixed couples
have often been reported as “Nganasan”. Furthermore, demographic data do
not show a direct correlation with the number of native speakers of a language.
Recent data suggest that a decrease in the number of Nganasans population is
accompanied by further decrease in the number of native speakers. Though the
figures from 1989 show an increase in population, this probably does not reflect
a real increase in the number of Nganasans. The period in question was a time
of change, when even the minorities of Russia were optimistic concerning their
future and people were more willing to consider themselves as members of a
minority. This tendency seems to be reversing today. The data for the past few
decades are given below:55 Source: Csepregi 1998: 255; http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/

"3Constituent OrderNganasan is a head-final SOV language. Therefore, complements and adjuncts
typically precede the head in a phrase. This order is present inside an NP and
in complex sentences as well. Neutral sentences always conform to the SOV
structure. This pattern is the most frequent statistically, but the word order is,
however, not rigid. The actual word order of the sentence primarily depends on
the information structure of the clause. (For more about this topic, see Chapter 14 below.) Sentence (56a) contains all constituents. As mentioned above,
the subject is normally expressed by null-pronouns, as (56b) it portrays. The
basic word order is displayed by the following sentences.

ChNS_080302_Bear_nar.005Quite frequently, this meaning is expressed with the help of the particle ŋɨɨtə‘not yet’ and simple negation. The sentence pair below shows the two ways to
express similar meaning. In sentence (67a) the speaker supposes that the eventverbal inflection259is going to take place. In this case, the speaker is sure to go hunting soon. In sentence (67b), however, there is no sign of presupposition from the speaker. For
this reason, in this sentence the abessive mood is not used, the verb appears in
indicative. In both cases the speaker is not hunting at the moment.

Dubitative
This mood is applied by the speaker, if s/he intends to express uncertainty,
doubt or surprise. The dubitative marker is attached to the S1 stem and has
the form -LU (-lɨ, -lʲi, -lu, -lʲü). The sentences are often questions without the
interrogative marker present on the verb, as in (68b). The following sentences
show the usage of the dubitative mood.

Speculative
The speculative mood is an epistemic mood, expressing the speaker’s assumption that the event might take place in a past with a present time result. This
expresses the meaning ‘it seems’. More rarely it can have a meaning conveying evidentiality. This is described in Chapter 6 below. (See also Szeverényi &
Wagner-Nagy 2017b.)
This mood is also mentioned in descriptions about Enets (Siegl 2013b: 288),
as well as in Nenets (Nikolaeva 2014: 101, she calls it the “approximative”). The
speculative mood is complex, the mood marker consists of a participle present
suffix (-NTUǝ, cf. Section 6.2.1 below) followed by the similative suffix -RǝKU
and the verbal personal endings, as in sentences (70a–b). According to the time
reference of the present participle, this form has a present time reference. In
contrast to Nenets, the past form is complex and it is not built using a past participle, but the speculative form of the main verb is accompanied by the past
tense form of the BE-verb, as in (71a–b). The speculative form is documented
not only with personal endings from the subjective conjugation, but with endings of the objective and reflexive conjugations as well, as in (70b) and (71a),
thus this category is a fully grammaticalized form. The future form however, is
not attested.","[276, 277, 278, 279]"

Negative Polarity Items
There are special NPI forms, which are derived from the interrogatives, similar to indefinites. The interrogative pronominal stem is followed by the -kəlʲičə
emphatic morpheme, as maa-gəlʲičə ‘whatever’, sɨlɨ-gəlʲičə ‘whoever’ etc. This
emphatic morpheme is identical to the emphatic suffix of personal pronouns
(cf. Section 4.1.6 above). The morpheme -kǝlʲičǝ does not carry a negative meaning in itself, which is indicated by the fact that it can occur in affirmative sentences as well—although in such cases it is not connected to the question word
as sentence (92) shows. The negative polarity items need a verbal licensor to
function as negative indefinites (see 93b below).

be classified according to their semantic characteristics or their morphological
make-up. Adverbs can be semantically divided into the following subclasses:
degree, locative, directionality and time adverbs. They can take inflectional suffixes: the spatial adverbs have a locative paradigm. This section first describes
the morphological structure of adverbs then classifies them according to their
semantic properties.
5.1
Morphological Properties
Monomorphemic adverbs are very rare, e.g. kuɁ ‘very’, talu ‘yesterday, tomorrow’. Adverbs only have limited inflection: they have only got a locative paradigm. They are of two types, depending on the ending attached to the stem.
The first group takes ancient inflectional suffixes, while the second group takes
the synchronically used inflectional morphemes.
Adverbs—that were originally relator nouns, pronouns (əm-, tə-), or most
often, postpositions—take the ancient inflectional morphemes instead of the
generally used endings. These adverbs have been lexicalized. Lative case does
not have an overt inflectional morpheme on the surface level, but the empty
consonant, which through the historically motivated deletion process disappears, triggers gradation. Ancient inflectional suffixes primarily appear on adverbs of place and time. In the case of adverbs of place, four directions can be
encoded (Lative, Locative, Elative, Prolative), while adverbs of time most often
take the Locative or Elative ending, occasionally the Lative suffix is used. It
might be the case that adverbs of time are practically adverbs of place used in a
time adverbial function. The ancient inflectional suffixes are given in Table 3.6.
Adverbs can take present day modern case suffixes as well; in most cases,
the common elative suffix is used, e.g. əm-kətə ‘from here’, ńer-kətə ‘from the
middle’. Some case suffixes have a function resembling that of derivational144chapter 3suffixes. In this description, they are marked as adverbial derivational suffixes.
They are shown below:
a) The plural genitive ending can form adverbs of manner and time:
ńaagəə ‘good’
→ ńaagəi-Ɂ ‘well’
ŋukəgəə ‘many’ → ŋukəgəi-Ɂ ‘often’
b) The lative and plural lative form of the word hüə ‘year, age’ forms the time
adverb hüətə ~ hüətiɁ ‘always, all the time’, but this word-formation is not
productive.
c) Similar to plural genitive, the singular prolative marker forms adverbs of
manner.
ərəkərə ‘beautiful’ → ərəkərə-mənu ‘beautifully’
nəŋhə ‘wrong’
→ nəŋhə-mənu ~ nəŋhə-mənɨ ‘badly’
d) Repetitive distributive adverbs of time can be formed by the prolative plural marker. In this case, the base can be only a noun with reference e.g. to
seasons:
sʲirü ‘winter’ → sʲira-Ɂmənu ‘every winter, in wintertime’
təŋə ‘summer’ → təŋu-Ɂmənu ‘every summer, in summertime’
The above discussed ways of derivation are, in almost all cases, in complementary distribution, which means that the adverbial form of each word can only
be derived in one way. Two different forms are seldom used for the same function. Such forms are, however, ńaagǝiɁ and ńaagǝǝmǝnu ~ ńaagǝǝmǝnɨ ‘well’.
The occurance of the latter forms is in only 5% of cases. Compare the following sentence pair.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.001Only some derivational suffixes take part in the derivation of adverbs. In some
cases, the adverbs are lexicalized and the derivational suffix is not systematically used to form adverbs. The sociative derivational suffix -səbtə ‘together
with’ (cf. Section 6.4 in Chapter 16) forms adverbs of manner: ŋubu-səbtə ‘with
the finger’, ńuə-səbtə ‘with the child’, taa-səbtə ‘with the reindeer’, kabi͡a-səbtə
‘with the shamanic clothes’. These adverbs are unchangeable.","[158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163]"

kasaďa ‘almost, nearly do smth.’
The auxiliary kasaďa with the meaning ‘almost, nearly’ was described in traditional descriptions (Tereshchenko 1979: 261, Wagner-Nagy 2002: 151) as a negative auxiliary, but actually it carries no negative meaning (see also Gusev 2015:
128). The auxiliary is followed by the connegative form of the main verb. It
can be conjugated in all conjugation types. Sentence (7b) shows the verb in
reflexive conjugation, sentence (7a) in the subjective, and (7c) in the objective
conjugation.

sentence for connegative forms, i.e. it cannot appear as a main verb in a negative phrase. Examples with a derivational suffix are sporadic. As sentence (7b)
above shows, the lexical verb normally takes the passive marker. However, the
auxiliary can also take, for example, the passive suffix, which can even be followed by inflectional suffixes, and the lexical verb can also take a derivational
suffix. This is shown by sentence (9).

ləðiɁsʲi ‘vainly, be unable’
The auxiliary ləðiʔsʲ can be classified as a type of negative auxiliary and translated as ‘cannot, be unable’, which is followed by the connegative form of the
main verb. The auxiliary is imperfective and occurs only with imperfective
verbs. It can take derivational suffixes (10b), tense markers (10c), and can be
inflected in the subjective (10a), reflexive (10d), and objective (10e) conjugation. Which conjugation is used depends on what conjugation the verb would
be in, if not in a construction involving an auxiliary. The use of conjugations
is discussed in Section 1, Chapter 9. The following examples demonstrate the
usage of the auxiliary. The opposite of this verb is the verb tukəďa ‘be able’, an
example is given in (11c) below.

əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe, be possible’
The auxiliary əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe, be possible’ behaves like the imperfective verbs,
but its paradigm is defective. It does not have an infinitive form, and does not
take tense or mood markers. Unlike kasaďa ‘almost, nearly’ and ləðiɁsʲi ‘vainly,
be unable’, this auxiliary takes the sentence final position, thus the main verb in
the connegative form precedes it. It is peculiar in that it assimilates to the lexical verb in terms of suffix alternation. (For information about suffix alternation
see Section 7.2 in Chapter 2.) It can be safely assumed that it evolved from the
particle əku (see Section 12.2 below). Thus, in principle, a process of lexicalization and not of grammaticalization can be observed. The auxiliary can be
conjugated by all conjugation types. The usage of the auxiliary is illustrated by
the sentences below.

ŋuəlɨ- ‘how can I not; of course’
The auxiliary ŋuǝlɨ- means something like ‘of course, how can you think I/you/
he will not; how could I/you/he not’. The majority of descriptions referred to
ŋuəlɨ- as a monomorphemic verbal stem (Tereshchenko 1979: 261; Katzschmann 1993–1994: 58), but in my opinion, the stem of the word is ŋuə-, which
is followed by the dubitative suffix -lɨ- and the personal marker (for dubitative
see Chapter 5, Section 5.11). It is possible that the stem is related to the particle
ŋuəlɨ ‘of course, naturally’ particle, but the direction of the evolution process
cannot be determined. The meaning of the stem ŋuə- is not absolutely clear, but
the S2 stem of the BE verb (i-sʲa) is also ŋuə-. Therefore, it is possible that the
dubitative form of the BE verb was grammaticalized as an auxiliary. However,
this supposition needs to be tested further.
This auxiliary is always followed by the connegative form of a lexical verb,
which suggests that ŋuəlɨ- is an auxiliary whose infinitive form does not appear among the data. This means, this is an auxiliary with a defective paradigm.
Although, there is very little data available with the ŋuəlɨ- auxiliary, but it is understood that, ŋuǝlɨ- can be conjugated in all conjugation types, though it never
combines with the aorist marker (-NTA or -Ɂə, see Section 4.1 in Chapter 5) or
other tense markers. This auxiliary cannot take derivational suffixes, but emphatic suffixes do attach to it, as sentence (12a) illustrates. There are however
only very few examples for this available. There are examples for the auxiliary
conjugated in the subjective (12a–b), objective (12d) and reflexive (12c).

konɨďi ‘become’
The verb konɨďi with the meaning ‘go away’ is also used as an auxiliary in
resultative and translative clauses with the meaning ‘to become something,
to change to’. It appears with nouns as well as with adjectives and numerals.
The auxiliary is obligatorily preceded by a nominal part of the construction
and the infinitive form of the BE verb isʲa. In interrogative sentences, the auxiliary takes the interrogative marker as in (13b). For detailed description on the
essive-translative construction see Szeverényi & Wagner-Nagy 2017a.

KVB_97_EvilSpirit.0274Pronominal ItemsNganasan has personal, interrogative, demonstrative pronouns and intensifiers. Human beings are referred by personal pronouns, while animals, plants
and objects by demonstratives. There are no dedicated possessive pronouns;
this is expressed using personal pronouns (see Section 4.1.7). Indefinites are
derived from question words using the -küə/-güə, -čə clitic-like morphemes (see
Section 7.3 and Chapter 16). There are no special negative pronouns, the question words with the emphatic clitic -kəlʲičə/ -gəlʲičə may be treated as negative
polarity items (see Section 4.6 below). Neither relative, nor reflexive pronouns
are present. The reflexive or reciprocal meaning is covered by the word hütəðə
‘body’, by the word ńa ‘companion, friend’ with the possessive suffix, and by
the word sɨɁ ‘image of living things’ marked for the relevant personal possessive suffix (15). If in this kind of sentences the intensifier ŋonə- appears, it has
an emphatic intensified meaning. Another possibility for expressing a reflexive
situation is the usage of reflexive conjugation; cf. Section 3.3 in Chapter 5.

Personal Pronouns
Personal pronouns can only refer to humans, animals and plants, while objects
are referred to by demonstrative pronouns, but occasionally demonstratives
refer to humans as in sentence (17c). There is no gender distinction.
All three numbers (sg, du, pl) and each person has a corresponding personal pronouns, making nine personal pronouns altogether. Special honorific
forms (such as Hungarian ön, or the use of plural forms in this function, as
in German Sie (3pl) or Russian Vy (2pl)) do not exist, however there are few
examples for the use of 2pl personal pronoun in this function. This is obviously
due to Russian influence.
The behaviour of personal pronouns is the most noteworthy aspect of pronouns. Although they cannot be inflected in the way other nominal categories
can, several emphatic clitic-like suffixes can be attached (cf. Section 4.1.4).
These emphatic markers may attach to other pronouns as well.
The 3sg, 3du and 3pl forms of personal pronouns are derived from the noun
sɨʔ ‘portrayal, picture, image (of living things)’ followed by corresponding possessive suffixes. The forms are shown below:
(16) Personal pronouns
sgdupl1st person mənə ‘I’
mii ‘the two of us’
mɨŋ ‘we’
2nd person tənə ‘you’
tii ‘the two of you’
tɨŋ ‘you’
3rd person sɨtɨ ‘she, he’ sɨti ‘the two of them’ sɨtɨŋ ‘they’Personal pronouns most often function as the subject of a sentence. If the
pronoun is the subject,—Nganasan being a consistent null-subject language—
it is only optional; the verb inflection replaces the pronouns. Overt personal
pronouns are only used in contexts where they have special discourse significance, such as emphasis. Sentence (17a) is an example with an overt pronoun
in the subject position, while in sentence (17b) only the verbal ending refers
to the number and person of the subject. (More about this topic see in Chapter 9). To the 3rd person humane referent in subject position can refer to theword classes107anaphoric demonstrative təti ‘this, that’. The demonstrative always take the 2nd
person possessive suffix. Some speaker use instead the anaphoric demonstrative the distant deictic pronoun takəə ‘that’. The exact distribution between
these forms regard further investigation.

ChND, 2008Personal pronouns can also serve as direct objects, but unlike to other Samoyedic languages, they not have inflected forms. Presently, the accusative and the
genitive forms are identical to the nominative form. Older speakers still tend to
use the former suffixes, especially in the accusative case (-m), however there are
only very few examples for this phenomenon. In the speech of younger speaker
the inflected forms never appear. Sentence (18a) illustrates a personal pronoun
in object position with the accusative suffix, while sentences (18b–c) depict a
personal pronoun without the case marker.

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.070Local menaings of personal pronoun are expressed by special postpositional
forms (cf. Section 4.1.1 below).
4.1.1
Oblique Cases of Personal Pronouns
Local meaning of personal pronouns are replaced by postpositional structures.
This feature is not unique among Uralic languages; for example Nenets, Enets
and Hungarian oblique forms are also of postpositional origin.
In oblique cases of personal pronouns, the inflected postposition na ‘to;
near’ is used, which is marked for case and takes a possessive suffix from the
oblique series. This postposition is optionally accompanied by the personal
pronoun. Postpositions do not take the common case suffixes described in Section 3, in Chapter 4, but rather a more ancient set of suffixes. Elative forms are
an exception, since they are inflected with the suffix which is still being used
today. The postpositional/adverb series of case suffixes is discussed below, in109word classesSection 5. In contrast to the locative, elative and prolative, the lative is morphologically unmarked. The reason for this is that the ancient lative suffix gets
deleted, according to morphophonological rules, before possessive suffixes that
begin with a consonant. (For a discussion of phonological rules, see Section 7
in Chapter 2.) The personal pronouns can appear before postpositional forms,
but this is only optional. The following chart shows the oblique forms.

Postpositional Form of Personal Pronouns
Personal pronouns do not have forms marked for postpositions. Instead, such
forms are used where the postposition itself takes the appropriate possessive
suffix (the one attaching to oblique cases). These inflected postpositions can
be used on their own, fulfilling the function of a personal pronoun, but the
relevant personal pronoun can appear before them. The chart below shows
how these forms are derived with the stem ŋilʲənu ‘under’. Other postpositions
behave in a similar manner. For information about postpositions, see Section
10 below.

Comparative Forms of Personal Pronouns
If in an equality sentence the compared entity is referred to by a pronoun, it is
expressed by a derived form of the postposition na ‘to, towards’ or with mantə
‘like, similar’. If the construction is formed with the postposition na, the similativesuffix (-RəKU) is followed by the nominative form of the possessive suffix
that refers to the appropriate person. It is, however, the oblique forms of possessive personal suffixes that connect to the postposition mantə. Both forms
are listed in Table 3.1.
In an equative sentence, the forms with the postposition na and -RəKU can
appear without the personal pronoun, while the postposition mantǝ is always
preceded by the pronoun.

the ancient elative form of the postposition na followed by the possessive suffix
form of the oblique series surfaces. In such constructions the object of comparasion must precede the predicate. The standard of the comparasion may
be covert and indicated only verbal ending attached to the predicate (verb or
adjective), as in (30a). The common elative forms are addressed in chart (20)114chapter 3table 3.2Pronouns formed from the special stem1 person (1sg, 1du, 1pl)

There are special forms for emphatic personal pronouns. Emphatic clitics can
connect only to these, just like some derivational suffixes. The special stems of
pronouns never appear on their own, only in suffixed form. The stem is followed
by an emphatic suffix (cf. Section 7, in Chapter 16) and the oblique case form of
the possessive suffix. The special stem ends in a -ń consonant, which although
it does not appear overtly, initiates palatalization and nasalization (cf. Section
7.4 in Chapter 2). In third person forms, the special stem has two versions. In
the sections below, which stem is used for the given pronoun form is always
indicated. Table 3.2 shows the special stems and the structure of the personal
pronouns.
Below is an overview of the forms of personal pronouns derived with the
limitative suffix as well as with the various emphatic suffixes.","[118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133]"

JSM_090809_Life_nar.351Inferential meaning can be expressed by the verb ńantɨďi ‘seem’ as well. This
verb is imperfective and cannot take a tense marker. Conveying this meaning
with the mood marker is also not common, there are only interrogative forms
attested. In most cases, this verb appears in the 3sg form, but there are very
few examples in which the verb agrees with the subject, as in sentence (5b)
below.

‘You seem to be poor, with your reindeer; you seem to be miserable with

JSM_090809_Life_nar.161The predicate in sentence (5b) is non-verbal (poor and miserable), the use of
the verb ńantɨďi is copula-like. It must be stressed however that the BE-verb can
appear in the copula position as well. However, in the latter case, the reading of
the sentence is not evidential. The examples demonstrate that, if the speaker
references momentary evidence, he uses the verb ńantɨďi, but if the statement
is general, the speaker uses the inferential form of the BE-verb. In sentence (6)evidentiality279the narrator of the tale says that in general, the small animals are bad, thus they
are unable to hunt.
(6) əiɁ, nəŋhu͡ə ŋanuə nagür ďaməða-ŋku

‘Three little bad, wild animals, so it seems.’
KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.017The verb ńantɨďi is typically used for quotations, as in sentence (7). (For more
about the usage of this verb and of the inferential mood, see Szeverényi &
Wagner-Nagy 2017b.) In the quoted clause, the negative auxiliary does not take
the inferential suffix, but the 3sg form of the verb ńantɨďi appears as a particle.

KES_031115_Paris_nar_1942Reported EvidentialityAs was mentioned in Section 5.7 in Chapter 5, the reportative mood marks
second-hand information, meaning the speaker heard about the action or
event from a secondary source, as in sentences (8) and (9) below. In sentence
(8) the speaker was present during the event, but she was only a new-born baby
and thus, she heard about this event only from someone else’s narration, as she
cannot remember it. Sentences (9a–b) depict a quotation. The speaker narrates
what the girl said to him.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.478The speaker may refer to the narration of a certain person, but reportative can
also be used to speak about events that are generally spoken about in the community. This mood is very often used, if a story is told about a certain person. In
this case, the feeling of reality is enhanced by the usage of the mood. It must be
noted, however, that tales and myths are told in the indicative and not in reportative mood. In a folklore text, the reportative mood appears, if the story teller
reports anything or the information comes from a specific person (see sentence
8 above). During shamanic ceremonies, the shaman reports the information
heard from gods in the renarrative to those present. Normally, the information
source is not specified, but in some cases the specific person can be expressed.
In this case, the reportative form semantically expresses the quotative, as in
sentence (10).

MVL_080304_NjomuKamleguNy_flks.020As described in Section 5.7.1 of Chapter 5, if the speaker must refer to a time,
the analytic form ought to be used.

‘Where are you going (they ask)?’
KES-SEN_031114_Dialog_conv.005Also, the interrogative-reportative is used, if the person being asked is sure to

This grammar examines the Nganasan language, an endangered Samoyedic
language, which belongs to the Uralic language family. This description is based
on the materials from the Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus (NSLC) which
was created as part of the Corpus based grammatical studies on Nganasan
project (supported by the German Research Grant; WA3153/2–1, for information about the corpus see details in Section 4, Chapter 1). Most of the examples
are taken from this corpus and are passages from spontaneously produced
texts. Another portion of examples are elicited materials, produced either
spontaneously or in response to questions. Data which rely on existing grammatical descriptions (as e.g. Tereshchenko 1979, Helimski 1994a, 1998 etc.) are
also occasionally used.
Examples are provided in phonological transcription form with morphemeby-morpheme glossing. Morphemes are separated with hyphens, multi-word
categories in glosses such as ‘elderly sister’ are linked by a dot as in ‘elderly.sister’. Grammatical categories which are not expressed by a separate morpheme
are linked by a dot as in run.3sg. Nominative singular is never marked. Words
which are necessary in the English translation, but are absent in the original
text are bracketed, the only exception are the personal pronouns. Because Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language, personal pronouns only appear in
sentences seldom. The Nganasan personal pronouns are not marked for gender. For the sake of economy, they are translated as ‘s/he’.
This grammar is intended to be a comprehensive description of modern
Nganasan, which follows the traditional structure. It consists of 16 chapters
and two glossed texts. The introduction describes the sociolinguistic situation,
a brief history, typological features and gives information about the corpus
used in this grammar (Chapter 1). The phonetic features and phonological processes are presented in Chapter 2. This chapter also deals with the phonological
and morphophonological alternations found in the data. Chapter 3 gives an
overview of the classification of the different kinds of words (word classes).
Morphological features are discussed in Chapter 4 (Nominal inflection) and
Chapter 5 (Verbal inflection). Chapter 6 and Chapters 8–13 describe the syntactical and some semantic properties such as noun phrases, types of predicates,
simple and complex sentences, verbal valence and evidentiality. Pragmatic
organization is shown in Chapter 14, while Chapters 7 and 16 describe the word
formation processes. In Chapter 15 some basic informations are given about the
core vocabulary. The reason for this is that it has traditionally been one of the
most neglected area in the study of Samoyedic languages. This description isxprefaceorganized in thematic sections. Chapter 17 contains two example texts with
interlineal glosses. One text is a short folklore text, the other text is a biographical narrative.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

MACh_940808_DogLake_flkd.016The derivational suffixes -kaj, -kalʲi ‘without’ also create adverbs of manner:
kəntə-gaj ‘without a sledge’, ŋənduj-kalʲi ‘without a boat’ (cf. Section 6.4 in Chapter 16).
An example for a non-systematic derivation of an adverb is küði͡a-hüɁ ‘tomorrow [on waking up]’, while some adverbs have been lexicalized as compounds. The second part of the compound is a noun referring to time, while
the first part is most often the demonstrative pronoun əmə ‘this’. The noun is
generally followed by an inflectional suffix or a postposition.
(96) Compound adverbs: pronoun + noun
əmə ‘this’ + ďalɨ ‘day’ + loc
→ əmə ďalɨtənu ‘today’
ŋami͡aj ‘other’ + hüə ‘year, age’ + ďa ‘to’ → ŋami͡aj hüəďa ‘last year’
əmə ‘this’ + hüə ‘year, age’ + ďa ‘to’
→ əmə hüəďa ‘this year’
Other adverbs have been lexicalized from a noun+postposition sequence, in
which the noun refers to time. In most cases, the postposition is ďa, although
other postpositions also occur, e.g. čühənɨ ‘at the moment’; baaðə ‘since’ or ńi
‘at, by’.
(97) Compound adverbs: noun+postposition ďa
təŋə ‘summer’ + ďa ‘to’
→ təŋəďa ‘in summer’
noru ‘spring’ + ďa ‘to’
→ noruďa ‘in spring’
sʲirü ‘winter’ + ďa ‘to’
→ sʲirüďa ‘in winter’
kamba ‘early spring’ + ďa ‘to’
→ kambaďa ‘in early spring’
ŋitü ‘autumn’ + ďa ‘to’
→ ŋitüðəďa ‘in autumn’
ďalɨ ‘day’ + ďa ‘to’
→ ďalɨďa ‘in the daytime, during
the day’
hii ‘night’ + ďa ‘to’
→ hiińďa ‘at night’
küði͡atu ‘morning’ + ďa ‘to’
→ küði͡atuďa ‘in the morning’
təə ‘that’ + baðə ‘since’
→ təəbaðə ‘since then’
təə ‘that’ + čühənɨ ‘at the moment’ → təəčühənɨ ‘then’146

Syntactic and Semantic Classification
In this section adverbs are classified according to their syntactic function. The
lists are not complete. Only the most frequent adverbs are shown.
5.2.1
Adverbs of Place
Adverbs of place generally have four forms, answering one of the following
four questions: where? (locative), from where? (elative), where to? (lative), and
along what? (prolative). However, there are some adverbs of place that have
only got one form. Some of these adverbs not only refer to place, but also to
time or describe other relationships. The stem (noun or pronoun) is followed
by the relevant case suffix or by a postposition. Some of the place adverbs have
a demonstrative as their stem, modified with a case suffix. These adverbs are
presented in Table 3.7.
The sentences below shows the usage of these adverbs.

Adverbs of Time
Adverbs of time are monomorphemic in some cases, but most often they
are derived or inflected forms. The meanings ‘yesterday’ and ‘tomorrow’ is
expressed by the same word talu, the exact meaning is decided by the time
reference of the conjugated verb: if the verb refers to the past, the meaning is
‘yesterday’, if it refers to the future, the meaning is ‘tomorrow’ (cf. Szeverényi
2012). Compare the sentences below:

KES_031115_Paris_nar.132The meaning ‘tomorrow’ can also be expressed by the lexicalized adverb küði͡ahüɁ ‘tomorrow, upon waking up’. This is the conditional form of the verb
küði͡asa ‘get up’. This adverb appears only with verbs in the future:

Adverbs of Manner
Not all adverbs of manner are morphologically complex forms, but most often
words in the plural genitive or prolative are used in this function. These cases
are glossed as adv. Although it cannot be determined when one or the other
suffix is used, the two forms are mostly in complementary distribution, that
is, no word can usually be used as a starting point of adverb derivation in two
different ways. The following two sentences illustrate the use of adverbs.","[163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168]"

chart (4) demonstrates, the harmonic classes are divided in this respect since
stems ending in /u/ belong to the [+backness] class, while those ending in /ɨ/ in
the [-backness] class. The number of words ending in /ü/ is very low, the reason
for which is that they are the result of assimilation in words originally ending
in /u/. Change in the case of words ending in /a/ occurs according to harmonic
value. This means that words belonging to the [+backness] class alternate with
/u/, while those belonging to the [-backness] class with /i/. The most frequent
changes are summarized in chart (4) below. In reviewing the alternations it179nominal inflectiondoes not need to be taken into consideration whether the stem final sound is a
member of a sequence, since this does not affect the result of the alternation.

Consonant-Final Stems
Stems ending in consonants also exhibit two kinds of alternation: gradation
and some stem types experience a stem-final consonant. The latter only affects
a limited number of words, as few words end in consonants (cf. Section 1.2 in
Chapter 2), only the following vowels can occur word-finally: Ɂ, m, ŋ, r, j, and the
deleted consonant (C) in the empty slot. However, stems ending in -m or -r do
not undergo stem alternation.
Words ending in consonants have stems where both S2 and S3 have linking
vowels. S2 stems have an -ə, while S3 stems receive a linking vowel according to
their stem class (e.g. -U: -u/ -ɨ/ -ü/-i). Chart (5) demonstrates a stem in which no
alternation of the stem-final consonant occurs. This, however, does not mean
that no gradation can occur in the stem. If the stem contains a consonant or
consonant cluster that undergoes gradation, the consonants in question in the
S2 and S3 stems are in the strong grade, since the syllable becomes open. In
these words, the S1 stem contains the weak grade, e.g. S1: huðar ‘harness’, S2:
hutarə- and S3: hutaru-.","[196, 197, 198]"

Work on this book took its first concrete form in 2006 during my work with
Zuszsa Várnai, Sándor Szeverényi, Nóra Wenszky and Attila Novák on the Nganasan morphological analyzer within the Project “Morphological analyzer of
Nganasan” supported by Hungarian Research Grant (OTKA, Hungary, project
number K60807). Thanks to my fabulous colleagues, I learned very much not
only about the Nganasan phonology and grammar, but about grammar writing in general. My ideas came to a final formulation during my works with
Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev and Sándor Szeverényi on a Nganasan corpus.
This project was supported by the Deutsche Forschungesgemeinschaft (DFG,
Germany, project number WA 3153/2–1).
I would like to thank here all persons who helped me to complete my study
on Nganasan. First, I wish to thank Tibor Mikola and Eugen Helimski, who first
introduced me to the Nganasan language and culture and who made my first
fieldwork trips to the Taimyr Peninsula possible. My fieldwork opportunities
were supported by a grant from Soros Foundation awarded to me in 1996, the
Hungarian Research Grant (OTKA, Hungary) awarded to me in 2007, a project
grant from Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF, Austria) awarded to Johanna Laakso in 2008, and a project grant from the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Germany).
Very special thanks go to my colleagues, Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev,
Oksana Dobzhanskaya, and Alexandre Arkhipov, who helped me to organize
the expeditions and who helped me during my fieldworks.
I also thank my colleagues Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev, Jean-Luc Lambert,
Zsuzsa Várnai, Oksana Dobzhanskaya and Sándor Szeverényi for sharing with
me their field recordings and permitting me to continue researching.
My gratitude also goes to Anna Fenyvesi, Gerrit Jawinsky, Hannah Wegener
and Alexander David Curtis for reading and correcting the manuscript of this
book. I would like to thank Marianne Bakró-Nagy, Valentin Gusev, Gerson
Klumpp and Sándor Szeverényi, who commented on the previous versions of
this grammar. Their remarks were helpful for my work. I would also like to thank
Brill: my work with the staff of the publisher has been very pleasant at all stages
of the production of this book.
Of course, my deepest gratitude goes to my consultants in Usť-Avam, Volochanka and Dudinka. Special thanks are due to my parents, to my daughter and
to my husband for their understanding, patience and emotional support.

This chapter summarizes basic facts about the Nganasan and provides an
overview of the history of the Nganasan people (Section 1). Basic information
about genealogical affiliation, dialects, sociolinguistic status of the language
and the typological profile are described in Section 2. Section 2.5 presents the
Cyrillic orthography as well as the writing system used in this volume. Section
3 provides an overview of previous works on Nganasan and describes the language data used in this grammar.","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"
"3Existential and Locative ClausesExistential and locative clauses are rather similar in general. Usually sentences
are regarded as existential in which the speaker states something about the
existence or non-existence of something or someone. According to the definition offered by McNally (2011: 1830), these constructions are specialized or354chapter 9non-canonical. Three major elements can be identified in locative and existential sentences: the entity (mostly an NP) about whose existence or location
something is stated (theme or pivot), the location in which the given entity
is or exists (locative phrase or coda) and the element (copula) connecting
the theme/pivot and the location/coda. According to the definition by Freeze
(2001: 941) or Milsark (1977) the entity, the existence or non-existence of which
is stated, must be indefinite in an existential clause, but it must be definite in a
locative clause.
The present section addresses the question how these two different types of
sentences—existential and locative—are expressed in Nganasan. As described
below, case marking does not play a role here—instead, the choice of verb is the
decisive factor in what interpretation a given sentence obtains. There are three
copula verbs in Nganasan: the “bare” copula isʲa ‘be’, the copula təisʲa ‘exist, be
present’, and the copula tənijsʲa ‘exist, be there’. One of the numerous interesting characteristics of Nganasan is that at least two copulas (təisʲa, tənijsʲa) can
be used in existential sentences. Both copulas were formed by the lexicalization of a pronominal stem (tə-) + BE verb (isʲa) combination, i.e. this structure
represents a grammaticalized pro-form for existential expression. The stem təappears for example in the pronoun təti ‘that, this’ and in some adverbials as təndə ‘there [lat]’, tə-ni ‘here [loc]’. While in English the pro-form ‘there’ and in
German the expletive pro-form (es) moves to the position of the grammatical
subject, in Nganasan the element tə can only appear directly before the copula, and other sentence parts precede this complex verb. This position probably
contributed to the prefixation of the pro-form to the verb. In the complex verb
tənijsʲa the copula is preceded by the adverbial locative form (təni) of the təpronominal stem. First existential sentences are discussed, followed by locative sentences.
3.1
Existential Clause
Of the Samoyedic languages, Nganasan offers the widest range of possibilities
concerning which existential sentences can be formed, namely, with or without copulas. In the existential constructions both existential copulas are used.
One is used to express existence in a place, thus this kind of sentences normally
has a locative (coda), while the other is used to express abstract existence or to
make a general statement. In the latter case, as can be seen below, a locative
element never occurs in the sentence.
The existential verb təisʲa ‘exist, be’ appears most often in existential clauses.
It is just as frequent in possessive constructions, but—as described in Section
4.1 below—these two constructions resemble each other in other respects as
well. This verb can take tense markers, so it can be used in past and future
as well, as in sentence (36b) below. The word order in sentences is coda–types of predicate355pivot–copula, which Freeze (1992) found in SOV languages. This construction is used to express existence in a place.

KES_031115_Paris_nar.057In most cases, the coda is not expressed in the sentence, but it can be overt. If
the coda is expressed, it takes the first position, thus the word order is coda—
pivot—copula.

KES_031115_Paris_nar.232356chapter 9In the corpus there are some, admittedly, very few, sentences in which the
word order is the same as in existential sentences, but in which the BE verb
(isʲa) is used, rather than one of the two existential verbs, as in (39).

‘In the tent there’s only a boy.’
KNT_940903_KehyLuu.011Copulaless existential sentences are far less frequent than those with a copula.
As shown in the following example, these sentences can be formed without a
verb form of any kind. This kind of construction appears in tales as one of the
introductory sentences.
(40) təndə
kuəďə ńi-ni
ŋuɁəj maɁ.
this.gen hill.gen on-adv.loc one tent
‘On this hill (there is) a tent.’
JDH_00_Musuna_flkd.004The constituent order in this kind of existential sentences is coda—pivot.
This, of course, does not allow for any speculations as to where the copula
would be, if there were one. This structure is probably used due to Russian influence. As for existential clauses in Russian, the word order is coda–(copula)–
pivot. The emergence of a parallel structure underpins the suggestion that
word order changes due to the influence of Russian. In any case, it must be
noted that this way of forming existential sentences is far less frequent than
the two other types presented above, and it only appears in narrative texts.
The pivot of existential sentences can be modified with numerals (number
determiners), number marking (in case of Nganasan, the plural and the dual)
and with quantifiers. Sentence (41a) below shows that a numeral can modify a
pivot without making it definite. The same is true for number marking, illustrated in (41b).

Locative Clauses
In a locative sentence, the existential verb introduced above (tǝisʲa) can occur,
but regularly it is the BE-verb (isʲa). In locative clauses, the word order is
pivot—coda—copula, but in elicited sentences pivot—copula—coda
was also accepted and used by native speakers, although in texts it appears less
frequently. Sentence (42) is an example with the verb isʲa ‘be’, while in sentence
(43) the speaker uses the existential verb tǝisʲa. In this sentence, the location is
not specifically mentioned.

‘There, a little way away, your sledge is (there).’
KTD_NN_SeuMelangana_flks.1149In a locative sentence the pivot must be definite. Demonstratives express definiteness, as in sentence (42) above the demonstrative təti ‘that’ specifies the
pivot. Possessive suffixes can express a real possessive relation as well, and
make the entity definite, as in sentence (43) the 2nd person possessive suffix
-rə which attaches to the word ‘sledge’. A noun may also lack explicit marking.
In that case, the pivot does not carry any possessive suffix nor is it preceded by
a demonstrative pronoun; the interpretation of the pivot as [+definite] is only
based on word order and the choice of the copula. The following sentences
show such unmarked noun phrases in the pivot role. Both pivot–coda–
copula and pivot–copula–coda order can be used, however the copula
coda word order is not common in the corpus, but it appears in elicited data. It
is probably a Russian influence. Indeed, in a locative sentence, the pivot always
precedes the coda.","[372, 373, 374, 375, 376]"

Elative/Ablative Case
The elative is used to answer the question “from where?”, thus expressing
the direction away from something or somebody. The source or origin is also

Prolative Case
As has been referred to in Section 3.1, the use of the prolative is semantically
limited. It cannot attach to words referring to animate beings because it only
marks direction. A noun in the prolative refers to movement across or along
something or movement to the end of something, as in (43a–b).

PKK_71_OneTent_flkd.093nominal inflection201Similar to many other languages like Erzya-Mordvin, the verbs with the
meaning ‘buy, exchange’ govern the prolative case, thus the price is rendered
in the prolative (45). The argument of mental verbs is most often in the prolative as well (46). The direction of hitting or cutting is also marked by a noun in
the prolative (47). Furthermore, the prolative case takes part in the formation
of adverbs (see also Section 5.1, in Chapter 3). It means that adjectives in the
prolative case can serve as manner adverbs as in (49).

KVB_97_SonOfAPriest_flks.4134Possessive InflectionThe possessive suffixes (poss), which are often complex suffixes, are attached
to nominal categories. These refer to the person and number of the possessor and also to the number of the possessed. If one entity is possessed, the
possessive marker is simple; no separate number marker is integrated into it.
Possessive suffixes have three paradigms: they attach to the stem in the (1)
nominative, (2) accusative, (3) genitive or oblique cases. Case suffixes always
precede the possessive suffix.","[216, 217, 218, 219, 220]"

851The figures are drawn from the official Russian national census and refer to the
Nganasan minority in the whole of Russia. Therefore, the data cannot be correlated with those presented above. The data from the 2002 and 2010 Russian
census should be used cautiously when interpreting them in sociolinguistic
terms. There are no exact data about the number of native speakers of Nganasan, the data only show the number of people who speak Nganasan in the
territory of Russia. Previously, people had to specify their mother tongue for
the census, while in 2002 and 2010 the question was: “What languages do you
speak?” This leaves the possibility of claiming to be a speaker of a certain language, even if it is not one’s mother tongue.
According to my field observations and private information, the number of
people who speak Nganasan is continuously decreasing. Language assimilation
started when Nganasan were settled (see Section 1.3.2 above). Since then, it
seems that this process cannot be stopped. This assumption is supported by the
results of a sociolinguistic survey conducted by Krivogonov (1998). According
to his data, 904 people belonging to the Nganasan minority lived on the Taimyr
Peninsula in 1993–1994,6 and only 42 percent of them (378 persons) considered
Nganasan their mother tongue. Further data are also startling:
a) only 5.8 percent (52 persons) of the Nganasan minority used the language
in everyday communication;
b) only 29.3 percent (264 persons) spoke Nganasan to their children.
Figures concerning the language competence are not optimistic either. Krivogonov (1998: 252) found that only 36.1 percent of Nganasans spoke the language
fluently, 5.1 percent had minor problems, while 9.5 percent reported serious difficulties speaking the language. The data which reflect the connection between
language competence and age distribution are also worth noting. While every6 Krivogonov does not specify in his monograph, whom he labeled as Nganasan in his research.","[35, 36]"

ChND, 2008If the pivot is expressed by a pronoun and the coda is expressed by an adverb
or question word, no copula is obligatory in aorist tense, as the adverb can take
verbal suffixes, as sentence (45a) shows, however the use the copula is most
common. In sentence (45b), the pivot is covert, the speakers use the copula
and the adverb does not take the personal ending. In past and future tense, the
copula is obligatory and it carries the tense marker.

and the word order play a crucial role in deciding what interpretation a sentence is assigned. Existential and locational sentences are differences in word
order: while locational sentences characteristically display the order pivot359types of predicatecoda, existential sentences prefer the order coda pivot. As shown above, the

Negative Possessive Clauses
Possessive sentences can be turned into negative sentences in several ways. The
existential possessive sentence type can be negated by the negative existential
verb ďaŋgujsʲa or the negative existential particle ďaŋku. Similar to existential
and locative sentences, the particle ďaŋku is applied to the aorist tense, and
it must agree in number with the subject. However, the negative verb is used
in all three tenses (see sentences 16a–b and 17a–b above), and it must agree in
person and number with the subject. This verb can take mood markers as well
(cf. 16c and 20b). This sentence type expresses that the possessed entity is not
in the possession of the possessor.

PED_080731_Competition_nar.385If the speaker wants to pose a negated question in the present tense, s/he normally uses the simple negative particle, which regularly takes the position at
the beginning of the sentence as in (21).

TNK 2008Apart from the negative existential verb, caritive suffixes can also express the
negation of a possessive structure. In this case, two structures can be differentiated. The NP with the caritive suffix can appear either with an affirmative form
or with the negative existential verb. The latter likely originates from the convergence of the nominative possessive presented above (Section 4.2 in Chapter 8) and the caritive construction. It is difficult to decide what kind of difference in meaning there is between the two constructions, some consultants
no longer distinguish between the two forms. The first structure is potentially
more tentative than the second. According to a native speaker consultant, the
first structure (NP with caritive + verb isʲa) suggests that the possessor does not
have any of the possessed entities at all (see 22a–b). The possessee, functioning
as the adverbial complement in the sentence, takes the caritive suffix. The copula takes the regular inflectional suffixes, and it agrees in person and number
with the possessor.

ChND_99_Barusi_flkd.007419negationAs demonstrated by the sentences above, this construction can be used for
both alienable and inalienable possession. In this sentence type the speaker
does not emphasize what the possession is, but rather the present state of the
possessor, namely that he or she does not have the given object at the given
time. As mentioned before, in this sentence type, the possession is the adverbial complement of the sentence.
There is another possibility to negate a possessive sentence. In this sentence
type, the possessed NP takes on the caritive ending; however, it is not accompanied by the BE verb, but by the negative existential verb (ďaŋgujsʲa) or the
negative particle (ďaŋku). Therefore, this is a case of what is called double negation, however, the meaning is not affirmative, but negative. The possessee never
takes on a possessive personal ending. The negative existential verb must agree
with the possessed NP. As shown in the following example sentences, this construction can be used for expressing both alienable and inalienable possession.
According to the consultants, with this sentence type, the speakers emphasize
that they do not own anything at all. In this construction the word order is (possessor) + negative existential + possessee in caritive.

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.118Transitive possessive sentences must be negated by the negative auxiliary. This
is the less frequently used means for negating a possessive structure, there are
only very few examples of this in the corpus. The standard negative auxiliary
is followed by the connegative form of the verb honsɨ ‘have’. Tense and mood
markers are carried by the negative auxiliary.

Negation of the Non-verbal Predicate
Negation in sentences with a non-verbal predicate depends on the tense. In
the aorist, the ńintuu(Ɂ) negative particle appears in the sentence immediately
before the predicate instead of the standard negative auxiliary. As the sentences
below demonstrate, in most cases the negative particle also takes verbal suffixes, not only the nominal constituents of the predicate (see sentence 25a). It
can occur that either the negative particle or the nominal part does not take the
verbal suffixes in this construction. This happens relatively often in more careless speech meaning, if the speaker speaks quickly. If there is a possessive suffix
on the nominal predicate, only the negative particle takes the verbal inflections, as in sentence (25c) below.

JA_0609_TwoTents_flkd.254If the sentence is not in the aorist, the negative auxiliary must be used, because
the negative particle cannot have both the tense and mood markers. The auxiliary takes the tense marker and the verbal suffix, but the connegative form of
the copula also appears in the sentence. Future tense sentences with a nominal
predicate are formed in a similar manner as in past tense sentences. Thus, it can
be stated that Nganasan applies the nominal strategy for non-verbal predicates
and that this is independent of the type of the predicate.

TKF_061025_SongOfATsar_flks.056In negative sentences word order is partly fixed, as the negative verb is always
followed by the sentence constituent being negated—in this case, the nominal
predicate. The negated copula must immediately follow the predicate in such
sentences, and these two form a constituent. In other cases, the negative auxiliary and the connegative form of the verb tend to appear next to each other
(cf. Section 1.1 above).","[435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"

Manner Adverbial Clause
A manner clause has the function of manner adverbs. These are formed with
the infinitive form of the main verb. It usually expresses simultaneous action
in time with the main clause as in the following sentences. The infinitive in
the manner clause retains its argument as in (34a) below. Normally, the manner clause takes the sentence initial or finale position, but rarely it can be
embedded as well, as in sentence (34a) in which the sentential subject precedes
the manner clause. Occasionally, manner clauses have an additional temporal
meaning as well.

Place adverbial clauses denote where the action described by the main verb
took place. The action noun -Ɂmuə/-Ɂmɨǝ is used to encode a non-finite locative relation. In this case, the nominalized form precedes the finite verb of the
matrix clause. This structure expresses anteriority, if the action noun takes the
nominal past marker (-ďǝǝ) as in (35a–b).

Ordinal numerals take the same inflectional suffixes as cardinal numerals. They
can function as a modifier or as a predicate in the sentence. When used attributively, they must agree partially with the head of the noun phrase—they have
nominative, accusative and genitive forms. The rules of agreement are discussed in Section 1 of Chapter 8 below. The following sentences illustrate the
use of ordinal numerals.

Numeral Adverbs
Numeral adverbs answer the question “how many times”. These are derived
from cardinal numerals and indefinite numerals with an adverb-forming suffix
(adv) that is formally identical to the Plural Genitive suffix. Only the final part
of compounded numerals takes the suffix.

Fractions
Nganasan only uses the fraction helɨə ‘half, part’. Expressions like ‘one and a half,
two and a half’ are complex constructions formed as follows: cardinal numeral
(in nominative form) + noun + helɨə ‘half, part’. The noun can often be omitted.

the word čiimi is often used to mean ‘meter’, as in the sentence əmkətə tajŋiə kəi ďa ďir čiimi

Other Expressions with Numerals
The expression ‘more than’ is formed from the elative form of the numeral and
the present participle form of the verb bǝtǝďa ‘be loose’: bəðətuə ‘superfluous,
vacant’.

Quantifiers
There are several quantifiers. Their referent can be human or non-human. They
are used to express the approximate number of entities. These forms are generally used in the singular, but bǝnsǝ ‘all, the whole’ and bǝńďikaa ‘every, all’
can take number markings, as the sentence (141a) shows. A noun following a
quantifier—just like in many other Uralic languages—is in the singular as well
(cf. Section 3 in Chapter 8). The following chart lists the quantifiers. The word
bǝnsǝ has two meanings: ‘all’ and ‘the whole’. The meaning of the plural form is
‘everyone’, while the dual form means ‘both’.

‘few, little’
‘few, small in number’The quantifier bǝnsǝ may appear before (141b) and after the head noun (141a) it
modifies, whereas bǝńďikaa is substituted for a noun or stands alone, i.e. it is a
pronominal quantifier (141c–d).

KBD_71_Relationship_nar.008The quantifier bǝnsǝ ‘all, the whole’ can take possessive suffixes as well. In this
case, the meaning is ‘all of us’. The possessive suffix refers to who belongs to the
group. These items always stand by themselves, that is, in this case, they are not
modifiers. The form bǝńďikaa cannot be marked for possessivity.

noun as in (143b).

Conjunctions
Conjunctions are rarely used. Juxtaposition of coordinated phrases or sentences is much more frequent. However, members of the younger generation,
who speak Russian well, also use Russian conjunctions. The word ŋonəə ‘and,
again, furthermore, one more’ can optionally appear as a coordinating conjunction, primarily appearing between coordinated phrases. The Russian i ‘and’
can also be used to fulfill this function. Sentence (144a) demonstrates the
conjunction-like use of ŋonəə, whereas (144b) depicts the use of the Russian
conjunction i. For coordination of clauses see Section 1 in Chapter 13.

Particles
Particles are quite often used. Emphasis is often expressed through morphological means in this language, i.e. emphatic suffixes or particles, which have
discourse-related meaning. Besides emphasis, particles can express conditionality, uncertainty, limitation or negation.
In contrast to Nenets and Enets, there are two negative particle-like element:
ńintu(u) and ďaŋku. Both can be inflected predicatively, i.e. they can take verbal
inflections in present, but no tense marking elements for the future or past. The
particle ńintu(u) is used to negate a non-verbal predicate. The word ďaŋku is
used to negate existential, locative, and possessive sentences. (For use of these
elements see Chapter 12 for negation.)
In general, particles do not take derivational and inflectional suffixes, thus
they are unchangeable. However, several particles can take verbal or nominal inflectional morphemes. For example, ŋɨɁtə- must take a possessive suffix,
while some others, like the negative particles ńintu(u) and ďaŋku can take verbal inflectional suffixes, if they occupy the predicate position in a sentence.
Only the most frequently used particles are discussed below. What position
these words can take in a sentence and which suffixes can attach to them is
given. Particles have not been described in detail, and the analysis of text-level
discourse has yet to be pursued further.
1. əku ‘maybe, probably’: This particle always appears after the predicate, generally at the end of the sentence. The verb in the sentence is mostly in the
indicative, but can take the irrealis marker (for irrealis see Section 4.8 in Chapter 5). The particle ŋəndiɁaiɁ ‘probably’ has a similar meaning also expressing
uncertainty (see below). The auxiliary verb əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe’ discussed in Section 3.3 above also has the same meaning. The auxiliary and the particle clearly
go back to the same proto-form.

KSM-ChND_061105_Hotarye_flkd.0252. kasaɁ ‘nearly, slightly’: This particle can be connected to the auxiliary kasaďa ‘almost, nearly’ (cf. Section 3.3). The particle always occurs before the word
it modifies.

Predicate with Reflexive-Medial Conjugation
Transitive-reflexive verbs, such as ďembɨsʲi ‘dress; dress oneself’, ďituďa ‘shoot;
shoot oneself’ etc. are always inflected in the reflexive-medial conjugation, if
their meaning is reflexive, as in sentences (10a and 11a–b). If the meaning is not
reflexive, but transitive, the verb can be conjugated by the subjective or objective conjugation.

KES_080721_Disease_flkd.356Sentences (12a–b) show the reflexive-medial and transitive use of the same
verb. In (12a) the verb is in the subjective conjugation. In the sentence, there
are both arguments: an agent and a patient and the object of the verbs precedes the verb immediately. On the other hand, in (12b), the ‘door’ is also a
patient of the action, though it is not the grammatical object of the sentence,
but the subject. The agent is not overt. In this case, the verb must be conjugated
reflexively.

TNK, 2006Medial verbs, such as nǝnsuďi with the meaning ‘get up’ and ‘stop’, are inflected
in the reflexive-medial or in the subjective conjugation, depending on their
actual meaning; objective conjugation is not possible. If the verb nǝnsuďi
means ‘get up’, it must be inflected in the reflexive conjugation, if it means
‘stop’ it can be conjugated in the subjective or in the reflexive conjugation. If
the action is changed and the sentence is highlighted, the verb meanig ‘stop’
remains in the reflexive conjugation as in (13c).

KNT_940903_KehyLuu.073However, it must be mentioned that not all verbs denoting movement can be
conjugated by the reflexive-medial conjugation. Only the following verbs are
able to take the reflexive endings: hojkuďa ‘run’; büüďa ‘go away’, čüüďa ‘arrive,
reach’, but they not necessary are conjugated reflexive (for motion verbs see
also Chapter 15, Section 3.2). The use of the conjugations is not evenly distributed. Table 9.1 illustrates the distribution of reflexive and non-reflexive form
of motion verbs in the corpus.
The verb büüďa most often is conjugated reflexively, while other verbs take
subjective endings. The three following examples from three different speakers
provide examples of its two possible uses. In sentence (15a) the verb is in both
conjugations, in (15b) it is conjugated reflexively, and in (15c) it takes a subjective ending. Of course, the question arises, what determines the uses of one or
another conjugation.","[358, 359, 360, 361]"

the object position, because the conjugation reflects the object, but the nonfirst personal objects are present. (For more information about the pronoun
in object position see Wratil 2013; for the usage of the objective and subjective
conjugation see Section 1 in Chapter 9.)
1.2.3
Predestinative Object
The object can be marked for predestinativity as well. In this case, the object
contains the destinative suffix (-Tə), followed by the ancient accusative ending (-m) and possessive suffix. The possessive suffix denotes the beneficiary or
recipient. If the destinative suffix takes on the theme of the ditransitive construction (direct object), as the examples below depict, the recipient or beneficiary does not obligatorily need to be expressed by lexical means, the possessive
suffix denotes it. In sentence (32a) the recipient is in the first-person singular,
and expressed by the possessive suffix (-mǝ), while in sentence (32b) it is in the
second person singular, and expressed by the possessive suffix (-rǝ).

Direct Object in Imperative Sentences
In imperative sentences the direct object usually occurs in the nominative, if
the verb is in 2sg or 2pl imperative form. This is typical not only for Nganasan, but for some other Uralic languages as well, as Finnish or Nenets. (For
Nenets see Janhunen 2002). From the present data, in imperative sentences,
the accusative case marking is generally preserved; only the 2sg subjectivesimple sentences377forms require a nominative direct object. In the case of 2sg objective imperative there is a variation: there are examples where the object is nominative
(33b), but cases have also been found where it is marked for accusative (33c).
The sentences below illustrate the shape of the object in imperative sentences.
The selected example sentences mostly have an object with a possessive suffix,
in these cases the nominative and the accusative cases are clearly different.

Other Arguments
Adjuncts are typically adverbials expressed by adverbs, nominal categories
with an adverbial inflection or with a postposition, or rarely bar nouns such
as talu ‘yesterday, tomorrow’ (35a). Furthermore, an infinitive can also function as an adverbial of manner. Adjuncts are optional constituents of a sentence. Locality, direction movement, place of destination, starting point of
movement, path (spatial adjuncts) and temporal relation can be expressed by
adverbials, a nominal category with a case inflection (35b) or by postpositional
phrases. Time and place adverbials tend to appear in sentence or clause initial
positions (35a and 36a). If there are two adverbials in a sentence, normally the
time adverbial appears in the clause-initial position.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.232simple sentences2379Basic Sentence TypesThis section describes the typical sentence types. A statement is expressed by
a declarative sentence, a question by an interrogative and a command by an
imperative sentence.
2.1
Declarative Sentences
Declarative sentences are unmarked. They appear in narratives, in dialogues,
as well as in folklore texts. The common word order in declarative sentences is
SOV, thus the predicate is sentence-final, but the word order is not rigid. Changing the word order does not change the sentence type. As mentioned above,
Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language, thus the subject is not obligatory
in a sentence and under certain conditions the object can be also dropped. The
following sentences show a minimal declarative sentence.

Section 6.2.1 in Chapter 16), as in examples in chart (31). The word ŋəbtə ‘smell’
can also take this derivational suffix: ŋəbtəəgə ‘smell of a(n old) man’.

According to our fieldwork data, a difference in the use of adjectives exists,
according to the [±human] value of the referent. Thus, two different adjectives
are to be used. It must be noted that some native speakers claim that the word
hoďəə can refer to a person as well, but others think it cannot. Similarly, some
say that sočakaʔa can also refer to a tree, but others think it cannot.
2.6
Temperature Adjectives
Nganasan adjectives expressing temperature are twofold. In one instance, the
true adjective is used, and in another, the verb’s participial form can be used as
an adjective. The list in (36) illustrates the adjectives, whereas the one in (37)
shows the participial forms. For a detailed semantic description of the temperature adjectives, see Brykina & Gusev (2015), for temperature nouns, see Section
1.7 above.

Birth, Death
For describing birth and death, a number of lexemes are available which are
not completely synonymous. In one situation, one lexeme, a basic word, is used,
while in another, an inflected form is needed. The difference in use is based on
the feature [±human].
(38) Lexemes for birth and death

kuəďа

feature -human]

‘be born’:
ŋətumsɨ [lit. ‘become visible’; cf. ŋəðusɨ ‘be visible’]
‘give birth’: ďiəďi [-human]. This lexeme is not found in the corpus. It
is taken from the dictionary (Kosterkina et al. 2001)
küŋalʲə- [+human]. This lexeme is recorded only twice
from the same speaker. In both cases the object is also
present in the sentence (cf. sentence 39b below).

It is taken from the dictionary (Kosterkina et al. 2001)
ńuə( j)čəsɨ [+human] (cf. ńuə ‘child’). This lexeme is a

Motion Verbs
The system of verbs describing movement is quite sophisticated. On the one
hand, verbs are differentiated according to the kind of movement, whether it
takes place on the mainland or on the water. On the other hand, the referent
plays a crucial role. Depending on its value [±human] and the fashion of moving, the correct verb is chosen. The verbs below are grouped according to their
value [±water] and [±human].
3.2.1
Movement on the Mainland
Some verbs denoting movement on the mainland can partly be used with
human subjects only, while others, with entities of any kind. Chart (40) displays the verbs sorted by the above-mentioned distribution.

3.2.2
Movement on the Water
Words expressing movement on the water (aquamotion) have been semantically analyzed by Gusev (2007b). For a more detailed description, see this work.
Again, it can be argued that the differentiation in [±human] plays a significant
role in the choice of the verb. Additionally, the value [±animal] is an issue here.
As was demonstrated by Gusev (2007b: 439), the act of swimming is not of any
importance to the Nganasan. This is partly due to the weather conditions and
to the fact that most do not know how to swim. The number of verbs used with
a [+human] entity is thus very limited. For the other two values, a semantic differentiation can be detected. The verb sɨǝďa ‘sink’ is not restricted to any kind
of subject, it can be used for all entities. The chart (42) illustrates the variation
in the use of the verb meaning ‘to swim’ according to the three different features.
(42) Verbs with meaning ‘swim’
[+human] [-animal][-human] [+animal][-human] [-animal]hoðɨrsɨ ‘dive’ (cf. hotɨďi ‘dive’)
ŋǝntǝusa ‘swim in the boat’ďambisʲa ‘float, drift’kuďüsa ‘float’3.3
Cooking, Feeding and Eating Terminology
As was indicated in Section 1.6 above, cooking plays a fairly insignificant role
in the Nganasan way of life. The number of cooking verbs is therefore rather
limited. The associated verbs are listed in (43).
(43) Cooking verbs
hiriďi
‘cook, boil’ [tr.]
hinsʲi
‘cook, boil’ [intr.]
hu͡atiďa ‘boil, cook’ [tr.]
hiðibtisʲi ‘bake’
munsəďa ‘boil’ [intr.]
The verbs hiriďi and hinsʲi are derivates with a bound stem hi- which cannot
occur as a separate word. The transitive verb has a non-productive transitive
suffix -Ru while intransitive verbs have a non-productive stative suffix -n. (For497lexiconmore detail on these suffixes see Section 6.3.2.1 and 6.3.2.2 in Chapter 16.) The
two transitive verbs with the meaning ‘cook, boil’ seem to be synonymous.
Compare sentences (44b) and (44c). Both verbs can be used with the destinative. With the word ŋəmsu ‘meat, food’ both verbs can be used, but with
transferred meaning such as ‘cook the ogre’ or ‘cook the child’ only the verb
hu͡atiďa ‘boil, cook’ appears (44d).

ChND_061101_TwoTents_flkd.017Nganasan has different forms for the concepts of ‘eating’ (solid food) and ‘drinking’ (liquid). In the differentiation between the verbs the substance of the498chapter 15patient plays the decisive role. All verbs are transitive, but the patient must be
not obligatory overt. One of the verbs has special meaning, ‘eat uncooked/raw’.
The object is normally not overt, but is mentioned in the previous sentences.
It refers to fish or meat (46a). There are some derived verbs expressing ‘eating’
and ‘drinking’ which are built with the help of the denominal derivations suffix -ir attached to names of foods and drinks. (For this suffix see Section 6.3.1 in
Chapter 16). Chart (45) shows these verbs, while sentences (46a–c) give some
examples for their usage.

verb bɨtɨďi ‘drink’ lost the general meaning ‘drink’, and now it is used with the
meaning ‘consume alcohol’. The imperfective pair of the verb ‘drink’ is formed
with the help of the iterative suffix (46d).

Temperature Verbs
There are several stative verbs denoting temperature. Stative verbs are nonderived in that many of them are marked by the translative suffix -m and have
an essive meaning. These verbs are, without exception, adjective stems, but not
all of them bear translative suffixes. The stative temperature verbs are shown
in (47), while chart (48) presents the derivates.

4.2
The Function of Possessive Forms
4.2.1
Possessive Function
The primary function of possessive markers is to express alienable and inalienable possession. Possessive functions such as belonging, part–whole, kinship,
legal ownership etc. are expressed by possessive suffixes. The following sentence illustrates the possessive function.
1. Ownership: ba-mə ‘my dog’ [dog-1sgposs], tuj-muɁ ‘our fire’ [fire-1plposs]

KNT_940903_KehyLuu_flkd.0204.2.2
Non-possessive Functions
Some of the possessive suffixes can be used in non-possessive functions as
well: the 2sg, 3sg, 1pl and 3pl suffixes. The use of these four suffixes is briefly
described below.
The possessive suffix 3sg (-TU) is often attached to mark the definiteness of
celestial bodies and natural phenomena (ŋuǝ ‘sky’, kou ‘sun’, məu ‘earth’ etc.),
but the denoted entity must be a planet or it must be topicalized.4 If the word
remains in topic position, it is marked by a possessive suffix (54a), otherwise
not (54b).

‘The sky is above, where we are now.’
MDN_97_TwoBirds_flkd.012Some possessive suffixes, such as 1plposs, 3sgposs and 2sgposs can also be
used in an identificatory function (anaphoric use) in narrative texts. They mark
4 In contrast to Nenets, other unique natural phenomena such as ŋuǝ ‘sky’, mǝu ‘earth’ etc. are
not necessary determined by the possessive suffix. (For Nenets, see Nikolaeva 2014: 68.)210chapter 4the entity which was introduced in a preceding section of the text or the entity,
which was not mentioned, but the referent can be linked to an entity, which is
reconstructable from the discourse by the hearer. (For more on this, see Section
2.1 in Chapter 14.)

PKK_71_Djajku_flkd.140–141Third person plural possessive suffixes have a selective function as well. If the
speaker selects an element from a group, a possessive ending is attached to the
name of the element. The possessive suffix refers to the group.

ChND_080729_SevenNjote_flks.0755DestinativeThere is a destinative marker in all Northern Samoyedic languages (Enets,
Nenets and Nganasan), which can only attach to nouns. If a noun is inflected
in the destinative (dst), this means that the person denoted by the noun
will get something or s/he is going to be the beneficiary (recipient) of the
action. So, the NP in question is usually a recipient-like argument of the sentence.","[226, 227, 228, 229]"

Indefinites
Indefinites are formed by attaching emphatic clitic-like morphemes to interrogatives. There are three sets of indefinites: one is formed with the clitic -Küǝ
(-küə/-güə), the other is derived with the suffix -Cčə/-Cči, while the third set is
built with the suffix -CčəKüə. The suffix -CčəKüə is composed of -Cčə and -Küə.
The ordering of the morphemes is strict. (For information on clitic-like morphemes see Section 4.1.6 above and Section 7 of Chapter 16.) The interrogative
derived with the limitative suffix -RA2a can express indefinite meaning as well.
By building locative indefinites, the adverbial case marker is attached after
the emphatic clitic-like morpheme: kuni-čə-nu ‘anywhere’ [pronstem-emphadv.loc]. (The adverbial case markers are discussed in Section 10 below.)
Indefinites can be classified according to their morphological make-up, semantics and specificity, cf. Table 3.4 below.
Indefinites can be specific and non-specific. Non-specific forms (derived by
-Küə) refer to entities that are unknown to the speaker, while specific forms
refer to an entity that is either known or unknown to the speaker.
The indefinite forms with -Cčǝ indicate that the referent is identifyable to the
speaker, i.e. the speaker knows who the referent is, as sentences (86a–b) show.

Overview of Previous Works
The first attestations of the Nganasan language are relatively late. The first
word list, which sporadically contains some Nganasan material was compiled
by the English travelling merchant Richard James in 1618–1620. However, in
his notes James does not explicitly mention the Nganasans. Daniel Gottlieb
Messerschmidt (1685–1735) was the first to document words in the 18th century. Not earlier than a century later, in 1823, this material was made available to the public in the work Asia Polyglotta by Julius Klapproth (1783–1835).
Also, a few Nganasan words can be found in the book Das Nord-Ostliche Theil
von Europa und Asia (1730) by the Swedish officer Philipp Johann Strahlenberg, who collected data from different languages during his time in exile in
Siberia. This work includes a comparative word list in which the words of the
languages are compared to corresponding lexemes of among others, the Hungarian language. Gerhard Friedrich Müller (1705–1783), the German scientist,
who led a scientific group on the second (great) Kamchatka expedition (1733–
1743) also collected, among historical and geographical materials, word lists and24chapter 1a few sentences from several Siberian languages including Nganasan. These
materials, except for the geographical and historical parts of his works, are
unfortunately still unpublished (see Helimski 2001). The polyglot vocabulary
Linguarum totius orbis vocabularia comparativa (1786–1789) compiled by Peter
Simon Pallas also includes some relevant language data. Word lists of different
length and comparative tables are included in his itineraries (1776). Pallas had
also used Müllers materials. All these data cannot or, only in a limited manner,
be used for linguistic analysis.
The first systematic data collection was performed by the Finnish scholar
Matthias Alexander Castrén (1813–1852), the first prominent scholar of Samoyedology. Castrén made conducted expeditions among the Uralic peoples and
started investigating Samoyedic languages in 1842. His third field trip lasted
from 1845 to 1849. Although he spent only a few weeks on the Taimyr Peninsula, the Nganasan and Enets language material he collected during this time
is appreciated as an important milestone in the research of both languages. In
1849, health problems forced him to leave Siberia. Once home, he started systematizing the material collected, but his early death impeded the completion
of his work. His manuscripts were edited by Anton Schiefner. The work entitled
Nordische Reisen und Forschungen von M.A. Castrén appeared between 1853 and
1862 in 12 volumes. It includes a grammar of Samoyedic languages (1854) and
a Samoyedic vocabulary (1855). Schiefner has simplified the notation applied
in the manuscript and often refrained from indicating dialectal differences.
Nevertheless, the work is one of the most important sources in Samoyedology.
Castrén’s merit is highlighted by the fact that, for a long time, no progress has
been made in the studies on Nganasan. From the time after the Russian revolution, only the short grammar by G.N. Prokofjev, published in 1937 is worth
mentioning. This grammar however does not represent substantial advancement as it partly relies on the data discussed by Castrén.
One of the most prominent researchers in the second half of the 20th century was Natalya M. Tereshchenko (1908–1987), who was also an expert on the
two other Northern Samoyedic languages, Nenets and Enets. Tereshchenko’s
first noteworthy studies on the Nganasan language were published in the 1960s
(e.g. Tereshchenko 1966). Her monographic description from 1979 represents a
culmination and synthesis of her oeuvre. However, the fact that it completely
lacks a syntactic description represents a limitation of the monograph. This
also partly holds true for the phonological description.
Between 1968 and 1972, several scholars from the Duľson School from Tomsk
have carried out fieldwork among the Nganasans and collected grammatical
data, word lists, and texts. Part of these texts were published in the series Skazkiintroduction25Narodov Severa (Tales of the Peoples of North Siberia, 1976, 1980, 1981), but a
good portion of these materials still have yet to be analysed and published.
The Hungarian scholar Tibor Mikola (1936–2000) was the first to provide
modern linguistic descriptions based on his work with a speaker of Nganasan
in Leningrad in 1968. A very short grammatical sketch attached to the texts collected was published in 1970.
Substantial contributions to the study of the Nganasan language were made
by Eugen Helimski (1950–2007), whose work represents an important milestone in modern studies. One of Helimski’s most significant achievements
was the description of the system of complex morphophonological rules such
as: syllabic gradation, rhythmical gradation, nunnation, and vowel harmony
(Helimski 1994a, 1995, 1998). This was an essential contribution to the description of the language, as the above-mentioned phenomena had only been briefly
dealt with in the previous literature.
Even though several additional texts have been published since the publications of texts by Mikola, there is still little published text material available in
Nganasan. The collections edited by Kazis Labanauskas (1942–2002), who lived
in Dudinka for several decades are also noteworthy (1992, 2001). Labanauskas’
latest text collection (2001) was translated into German by Michael Katzschmann. Based on these texts, Katzschmann compiled a grammatical description
of Nganasan (2008).
The practical Nganasan-Russian-Nganasan dictionary, compiled by T. Ju.
Zhdanova with the help of two native speakers Nadezhda T. Kosterkina (1952–
2005) and Aleksander Ch. Momde (1945–2001), deserves special mention. This
difficult to access dictionary is a useful tool for language learners since it provides word base variants as well as additional morphophonological information.
In the 1980s, research on grammar intensified. Ekaterina Boľdt deals in her
monograph with nominal derivation (1989). Wagner-Nagy in her monograph
investigated word-formation in general (2001), and she compiled a text book
and short grammatical description in 2002, in which some essential point of
phonology, morphology and syntax were raised.
Syntax is a less well investigated area; there are hardly any monographic
descriptions in this field. After Tereshchenko’s monograph on Samoyedic syntax (1973) only the work of Kovalenko (1992) dealt with syntax.
Recently Nganasan language corpora with interlinear glosses have also been
made available via the internet.7

Language Data for This Study
In this grammar, fieldwork materials are analysed which were collected during several field trips between 1937 and 2016. The transcripts are part of the
Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus (NSLC), which has been created as part of
the Corpus based grammatical studies on Nganasan project (supported by the
German Research Grant; WA3153/2–1) whose primary goal is to generate a digital, searchable corpus of spoken Nganasan. During fieldwork sessions, at least
two types of language data are collected: (1) elicited sentences aiming to clarify grammatical or lexicological questions, (2) texts and songs. My fieldwork
materials, which are part of the corpus, consists of data collected during four
fieldwork trips, carried out in 1994, 1996, 2008, and 2016. Altogether, I spent four
months in Usť-Avam, and in Dudinka as well as working with language consultants in Moscow.
The grammatical description in this volume is based on language data from
the Avam dialect. It relies on existing grammatical descriptions (e.g. Tereshchenko 1979, Helimski 1994a, 1998 etc.), language data derived from fieldwork
text collections, and elicited data. For illustrating grammatical phenomena, I
prefer to provide sentences from the collected texts over elicited sentences.
Syntactical and pragmatic phenomena can only seldom be demonstrated using
elicited sentences. As concerns these data, I assume a considerable Russian
influence (especially in the case of word order), which is a limitation of these
data. However, there are certain phenomena in the corpus data which proved
to be of little or no use. In this case, I use elicited data. The examples are provided with glosses and English translations. The glosses will be presented using
a slightly modified version of the Leipzig Glossing Rules (LGR).

Daniel (2003, 2004, 2006), Oksana Dobzhanskaya (2006), Valentin Gusevwere published [http://www.univie.ac.at/negation/sprachen/nganasana.html]. The project
was supported by Austrian Science Fund (FWF). Within the framework of the LangueDOC
project that was carried out in Moscow, 8 texts (comprising altogether 322 sentences) were
glossed by Valentin Gusev. Part of these texts are everyday stories, part of them are tales
[http://www.philol.msu.ru/~languedoc/eng/ngan/corpus.php]. Gusev published 54 texts as
word documents in the project Ethnocultural Interaction in Eurasia (2003–2005). The “corpus” comprises 14,928 sentences and about 28,000 word forms. [http://www.iling‑ran.ru/

would like to thank all colleagues who have shared their material with me
and who permitted me to work with them and to build a corpus from these
resources. The basic information from the corpus is given in Table 1.4.
The shortest text consists of only two sentences, while the longest text consists of 836 sentences (and 4,946 tokens). The first data was collected by Prokofjev in 1933 from Torunte Kosterkin (see Prokofjev 1937). This is the first text ever
published in Nganasan. The latest transcriptions are from 2016. Figure 1.4 below
shows the number of collected sentences per year. As can be seen, the majority of materials were gathered in 2008, in this year, two fieldworks were carried
out, one in Volochanka and the other one in Ust’-Avam.
The corpus consists of various genres: (1) three types of folklore texts (tales,
myths etc.): siteby, dyurymy and underspecified folklore texts, (2) narratives
(every day stories, biographies etc.), (3) songs and (4) spontaneous and stimulated conversations (topic not specified). The majority of the texts represent
the genre folklore, and it must be pointed out that two genres are underrepresented. None of these are songs. We have many songs, but this type of text
is unique and is not convenient for illustrating grammatical phenomena. The
other underrepresented genre is conversation. The reason for this being that
conversation is hard to record and very difficult to transcribe. There are very
few situations wherein the speakers converse in Nganasan. Figure 1.5 shows the
balance of the genres in the corpus.
The first and second version of the corpus has been already published (Brykina et al. 2016, 2018). In this study, I used the entire corpus, not only the published versions. Elicited data are not part of this corpus, but they are used in
the grammar.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]"

The meaning of this emphatic pronoun is something like ‘I/you … could also
do it for sure’. Generally, these forms appear in answers or in sentences which
are reactions to a previous statement (see sentences 46a and 46b). A special
characteristic of this form is that the stem vowel is lengthened.","[139, 140]"

Present Participle
The present participle (imperfective participle) is used, if the action or property denoted by the participle and the action denoted by the main verb is taking
place simultaneously. The suffix of the present participle -NTUə attaches to the
S1 stem of the verb. If the suffix attaches to an r-final stem, the suffix-initial
consonants are deleted, i.e. the suffix starts with a vowel. In other cases, the
suffix begins with a consonant, whose quality is determined by the phonological rules. The following charts show the form of the suffix and give examples.

or as the predicate of the sentence. In the latter case, it takes the personal suffixes of the subjective conjugation (cf. Section 2 of Chapter 9). In sentence (76),
the present participle assumes the pre-modifier position, while in sentence (77)
the participle is the predicate of the sentence.

Past Participle
The past participle (perfective participle) is used, if the action denoted by the
participle has been completed before the action denoted by the main verb of
the clause, i.e. it expresses antecedence. The past participle marker is attached
to the S1 stem of the verb: -SUəďəə. This suffix can either be attached to a perfective or an imperfective verb: kuə-ďüəďəə ‘dead, who had died’, barətə-suəďəə
‘who had waited’, ńilɨ-ďiəďəə ‘who had lived’, kəntɨ-ďiəďəə ‘who had frozen’,
ŋuńüntə-sʲüəďəə ‘who had collected’.
The past participle can either be a predicate, as in (78), or a pre-modifier in a
nominal phrase as in (79a–b). As these sentences reflect, the participle can take
possessive suffixes, which refer to an actor of event. Thus, in sentence (79a) the
3sg possessive suffix refers to the dropped agent, who has found the people,
while in sentence (79b) it refers to the polar fox.

Necessitative Participle
The necessitative participle (called by Helimski 1998: 507 as future participle)
refers to an action that is to be fulfilled in the future. The necessitative participle marker attaches to the S1 stem of the verb: -ɁSUTə. The marker can attach to
perfective and imperfective verbs as well: tuj-sʲüðə ‘who is going to arrive’, basu-266chapter 5Ɂsutə ‘who is going to hunt’, tərəu-Ɂsutə ‘who is going to work’ hoðətə-Ɂsutə ‘who
is going to learn’. The necessitative participle is mostly used as a pre-modifier
in a nominal phrase. It should be noted, however, that the necessitative forms
are extremely rarely used.

ChND_061025_Haljmira_flks.149The necessitative participle has a past form, which is formed from the necessitative participle of the verb with the help of the -ďəə nominal past suffix
(cf. Section 6.1.4.2 in Chapter 16). Therefore, the complex suffix has the forms
-ɁSUTəďəə. This participle denotes actions that should have happened: tujsʲüðəďəə ‘who should have come’, melɨðə-Ɂsɨðəďəə ‘who should have made
something’. The form is only used as a pre-modifier in a nominal phrase.

Abessive Participle
The abessive participle refers to actions that have not yet taken place. The
abessive marker is attached to the S1 stem of the verb: -məTUmA1Ɂa. Both perfective and imperfective verbs can take this marker: tuj-məðumaɁa ‘who has not
arrived’, ńilɨ-mətɨmɨɁa ‘who has not lived’, büü-mətumaɁa ‘who has not gone
away’, kəntɨ-mətɨmaɁa ‘the one that has not been frozen’, hoðətə-məðumaɁa
‘who has not learnt’. This form can take an attributive or predicative position.

KSM_080804_Village_nar.026The past form of the abessive participle is formed with the help of the -ďəə
nominal past suffix (cf. Section 6.1.4.2 in Chapter 16) attached to the abessive
participle, therefore the complex suffix attached to the S1 stem of the verb is
-məTUmA1Ɂaďəə: kotu-mətumaɁa-ďəə ‘who had not been killed’. This participle is rarely used. There are no examples for this form in the corpus.
6.2.5
Passive Participle
The marker of the passive participle attaches to the S1 stem of a transitive verb,
it is always of the form -məə: ďebtu-məə ‘[the one] told’, kotu-məə ‘[the one]
killed’, čii-məə ‘[the one] hidden’, sočələ-məə ‘[the one] sewn’, biri͡amtɨ-məə ‘[the
one] injured’. It can either take the attributive or the predicate position. Sentence (83b) shows the participle in the pre-modifier position, while in sentence
(83a) it functions as a predicate.

to the S1 stem of the transitive verb: kotu-məə-ďəə ‘[the one] killed long ago’.
This form is used sporadically. In the example below it takes the attribute position and shows agreemen with the head noun in number.

Iterative Participle
The marker for the iterative participle is -KUTə, which is attached to the S1 stem
of the verb. It can be used with perfective and imperfective verbs as well with
the meaning ‘usually do anything, do anything with pleasure’: basu-gutə ‘who
hunts with pleasure’, hu͡aŋku-gutə ‘who drinks with pleasure’, laŋür-kutə ‘who
often shouts’, ŋəjbəu-gutə ‘who loves to work’. The following sentences show
the usage. The participle can take the attribute as well as the predicate position.

Supine Forms
The supine (or purposive converb) is used to form a clause of purpose (cf. Section 3.2 in Chapter 13). The agent of the sentence/act is mostly marked by a
possessive suffix attaching to oblique cases on the supine form of the verb.
There are three kinds of supine forms.
6.3.1
Supine with -nA2Kə
The marker -nA2Kə (-nakə, -nagə, -ni͡akə, -ni͡agə) attaches to the S1 stem of the
verb, and the arising form appears in positive sentences. In negative sentences,
it attaches to the negative auxiliary, as the sentence (86b) below illustrates. The
agent is marked by an oblique form of the possessive suffix following the supine
marker: hoðətə-nagə-nuɁ ‘in order that we learn’, basu-nakə-nə ‘in order that I
hunt’.

KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.0016.3.2
Supine with -ɁsA2
The second supine form has the marker -ɁsA2 (-Ɂsa, -Ɂsi͡a), which is attached to
the S1 stem of the verb. It is used in positive sentences: kačəmə-Ɂsa-ti ‘in order
that the two of them can see’. In negative counterpart the suffix is attached to
the negative auxiliary as in (87b).

MVL_080303_SevenGirls_flkd.114The difference between the usages of the two supine forms, presented above, is
not really clear. Gusev (2005: 23) claims that the two kinds of supine constructions and the action noun with the suffix -bsa are interchangeable. However, it
must be noted, that there is not enough material to prove or disprove Gusev’s
statement.
6.3.3
Negative Supine
This form arise through attaching the marker -mUNKəCTə (-muŋkətə, -mɨŋkətə,
-müŋkətə, -miŋkətə, -muŋgətə, -mɨŋgətə, -müŋgətə, -miŋgətə) to the S1 stem of the270chapter 5verb. This is a complex suffix made up of the action noun forming suffix -mUN(see Section 6.1.2.1 in Chapter 16) and the elative suffix (-KǝCTǝ): ńijku-muŋgətə
‘in order not to sweat’, büü-müŋkətətə ‘in order that you will not go’, ďorələmuŋkətə ‘in order that s/he will not start to cry’. The agent is again marked by a
possessive suffix from the oblique series following the marker. As we have above
seen, negative supine can be expressed by the supine form of the negative auxiliary. The two constructions are synonymous. The negative supine form is only
sporadically attested in texts.

Temporal-Conditional Converbs
All Northern Samoyedic languages have a temporal-conditional nominalized
forms.5 Two types of temporal-conditional converb exist: one refers to condition in the present; the other one refers to the future. Both are formed from the
S1 stem of the verb. Additionally, there is a periphrastic construction composed
of the present conditional form of the BE-verb and the future or past form of
the lexical verb: təi-sʲüə i-hüɁ ‘if it was/existed’, mi-sʲiə ihüɁ ‘if s/he gave’, ńilɨ-ďiə
i-hüɁ ‘if s/he will live’. The markers are presented in chart (89) below:5 For Enets see Siegl 2013b: 326–327, for Nenets Nikolaeva 2014: 110–113.","[282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289]"
"18chapter 1Nganasan around the age of 70 were proficient in the language, only 5.9 percent of children under 10 years of age (16 persons) spoke Nganasan. Although
the survey was non-representative, the data clearly show the status of the language. As passing the language to further generations has ceased among the
Nganasans, an irreversible process of language loss has begun.
Until the 20th century, Nganasans had closer contact only with the Enets.
Inter-ethnic marriages were only attested between Nganasans and the Enetses
(cf. Afanasyeva 1990); in these marriages, typically the wives were of Enets origin and switched to using Nganasan. In 1976, inter-ethnic marriages accounted
for one fourth of all Nganasan marriages: 21 per cent of all marriages were
between Nganasans and Enetses, and in the remaining 4 percent, the nonNganasan spouse was of Nenets, Dolgan or Evenki origin. After the settlement
of Nganasans, the traditional Nganasan–Enets relations loosened. Currently,
inter-ethnic marriages are more frequent, Nganasans marry Dolgans or Russians. Krivogonov (1998) reports that 56.9 per cent of women and 30.3 percent
of men lived in an inter-ethnic marriage. Children born to such a marriage typically speak Russian instead of the mother tongue of either of the parents, as this
is the language the parents use to communicate with each other. Therefore, it
can be stated that today the extinction of the language is an irreversible process.
2.4
A Short Typological Overview
Like other Uralic languages, Nganasan is a typical agglutinative language. However, many morphemes consist of more than one morphological meaning.
Thus, the language displays a series of flectional features because several morphemes are cumulative. (For nominal and verbal inflection see Chapters 4 and
5). Some morphemes (suffixes or clitic-like morphemes) are equivalent to lexical items in European languages. (For this morphemes see Chapter 16). Prefixation is absent. Nganasan grammar reflects many characteristics typical of
the Uralic languages, but also some unique features, cf. morphophonological
alternations (see in Chapter 3, Sections 7.1 and 7.3) etc.
The open word classes are verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. These
classes can be distinguished by morphologic, syntactic and semantic criteria,
however adjectives are not clearly distinguished from nouns. There is a set of
relator nouns mostly with the locational semantics that take special (archaic)
markers of the Lative, Locative and Elative cases (See in Section 6 of Chapter 3).
Nouns are inflected for number, case and possession. They can appear in
seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, lative-dative, locative-instrumental, ablative-elative and prolative) and three numbers (singular, dual and
plural). Possessive suffixes convey possessive meaning; indicating the person
and number of the possessor as well as the person and number of the possessedintroduction19entity. Additionally, there is a category typical for the Northern Samoyedic languages, the (pre)destinative (see Section 5 in Chapter 4). Noun phrases display
the determiner and head constituent order. Possessive pronouns are missing.
The verbs have three conjugation types (subjective, objective and reflexive).
They agree with the subject in person and number and can agree with the object in number as well. Contrary to many other Uralic languages, there are three
morphologically expressed future tenses (general future, immediate future and
future-in-the-past). Additionally, Nganasan has two past tenses (past and pluperfect). Verbal stems are classified into two aspectual classes: they are either
imperfective or perfective. Depending on the aspect value, imperfective verbs
describe a present situation in the present tense (aorist), past situation in the
past tense, while perfective verbs denote the immediate past situation in the
present tense (aorist) and remote past situation in the past tense (cf. Section 4.2
in Chapter 5). Additionally to indicative, there are 11 morhologically expressed
verbal moods (imperative, admonitive, optative, interrogative, inferential, reportative, irrealis, necessitative, abessive, dubitative, speculative). Mood and
tense markers cannot be combined. Verb can be modified by a large number of
Aktiosart and modal suffixes as well (see Chapter 16).
As in many other Uralic languages, standard negation is expressed by a negative auxiliary, which is followed by the so called connegative form of the lexical
verb. For negating of constituent a negative particle is used (cf. Chapter 12).
Predicate possession sentences belongs to the existential type, thus the predicate verb is a special existential verb. However, opposed to the majority of
Uralic languages, possession can be expressed by a transitive verb as well. (For
possessive clauses see Section 4 in Chapter 9).
Nganasan is a head-final language and has a non-rigid SOV word order. The
word order in a sentence is motivated by the information structure (cf. Chapter 14). Determiners (inclusive possessors) are always left-branching. According to Holmberg’s classification, Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language
(Holmberg 2005, 2010), in which both, the pronominal subject and in certain circumstances the pronominal object can be omitted in a sentence. The
pronominal object of a sentence is only expressed overtly, if it receives extra
emphasis or if it is in a topic position (see Section 2.1 in Chapter 14). There is
no differential object marking, however the direct object of an imperative sentences can appear in the nominative.
Subordinate clauses are built with non-finite verb forms: participles or nominalized forms, which preserve the argument structure of the base verb. The
use of conjunctions is not typical. Coordination is expressed by the simple
parataxis. Nganasan, like other Samoyedic languages, expresses definiteness
not through articles, but by other means, e.g. with possessive suffixes or word20chapter 1order. (For more on the characteristics of the typology of Samoyedic languages,
see among others Bakró-Nagy 2012, 2006, Hajdú 1985 and Tauli 1963.)
2.5
Orthography
2.5.1
Nganasan as a Written Language
The first official orthography was created by the Samoyedologist Natalya M. Tereshchenko in 1986, but the alphabet was inconsistent and the system has
never been widely used. In 1989, a committee (consisting of A.A. Barbolina,
A.A. Momdye, A.Ch. Momdye, E.A. Helimski) was set up in Dudinka to eliminate inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the Tereschenko system. The final
version of the orthography appeared in 1992. The alphabet employs all the
graphemes of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet and the following additional characters: i, ÿ, ə, ң, Ɂ or ″, the last two symbols represent the glottal stop. The consonant /ð/ is marked by the symbol ⟨δ⟩, but it is often replaced by the Cyrillic
⟨з⟩ or the symbol ⟨ʒ⟩ for typographical reasons.
In sum, the alphabet consists of the following characters:
Ɂ (”), ə, a, б, г, д, δ (з, ʒ), е, ё (ѳ), и, i, й, к, л, м, н, ӈ, o, п, р, с, т, у, ÿ (Ү ), х, ч,
ы, э, ю, я
The parenthesized letters can be used for technical reasons, to replace the
preceding character. Although this is the official alphabet, its use is not compulsory. The usage of characters depends on the author and the editor of a
publication, mainly based on typographic considerations.
Furthermore, loanwords may contain any of the following letters: в, ж, з, ф,
ц, ш, щ, ъ, ь
1. The writing principles—as well as the characters—are adopted from Russian. This means that a palatalized or palatal consonant does not have a
separate grapheme as in the phonological Latin script (e.g. ń [ɲ] versus
n), but the palatality of the consonant is marked by the choice of the following vowel character: an “iotated” vowel (и, ё, я, ю) instead of ы, о, а, у
respectively, e. g. немы [ɲemɨ] ‘mother’, десы [ɉesɨ] ‘father’.
2. Long vowels are marked by doubling the vowel letter: маа [maː] ‘what’. If
there is a palatal consonant preceding the long vowel, the long vowel is
marked by a sequence of an iotated vowel and its non-iotated pair: няа
[ɲaː] ‘Nganasan’. Vowel pairs are as follows: я—а, ю—ÿ, и—i, ё—о.
3. The letter ⟨i⟩ is only used after non-palatal consonants. The grapheme for
a long i [iː] is ⟨iu⟩: miu [tiː] ‘the two of you’.
4. There is no separate symbol to denote the diphthongs [i͡a] and [u͡a] in the
Cyrillic alphabet, these are marked by the letter sequences ⟨ua⟩ and ⟨ ya⟩,21introduction5.respectively. The diphthong [i͡a] is often marked by the Cyrillic letter ⟨я⟩,
e. g. хяӈ [hi͡aŋ] ‘palm’.
The rare vowel sequences /ia/, /üa/ are written as follows:Latin script Cyrillic script Examples
ia
üa6.ea or иа
ёа, юа or ѳадиа or rarely деа [ɉia] ‘brain’
дюату, дёату or дѳату [ɉyatu] ‘s/he disturbs’The assimilation of vowels is often marked in Cyrillic writing. For example, the traditional буəзу ‘word’ [buoðu] form is replaced by буозу.","[36, 37, 38, 39, 40]"

‘I will tell the children a small tale, not a tale, a simple story.’
MACh_93_TwoTales_flkd.001The most usual order of the constituent in a construction with the verb ďebtuďa ‘tell’ is (A) T AD V, as in sentence (3c), but if the theme is topicalized as in
sentence (3b), it takes the preverbal position and the addressee moves into the
postverbal position. Thus, if the agent is present, it always takes the preverbal
position and always precedes the addressee.
The verb munuďa behaves differently. As example (3a) demonstrates, this
verb normally appears in the main clause, and the subordinate clause is its
theme argument, which is normally expressed as indirect speech in languages
that have it—Nganasan, does not (see Section 3 in Chapter 14). This verb cannot be used with substantives like sʲitǝbɨ ‘tale’ and ďürɨmɨ ‘story’ as objects. As
mentioned in Section 2.2.3 in Chapter 10, the verb ‘what say’ does not have any
argument, the question word is incorporated into the verb. (For the structure
see example (49b) in Chapter 10.) So, there is a semantic difference between
the two verbs and their argument structures differ accordingly.
Personal pronouns cannot take case markers and cannot be inflected in
the same manner as other nominal categories, thus if the recipient-like argument is pronominal, the speaker must use a different construction to code the
recipient. The oblique case forms of pronouns are replaced with postpositional
structures (see Section 4.1.1 in Chapter 3). In this case, the postposition ďa is
followed by the destinative suffix -Tə (-tə, -ðə), and by the oblique case form ofditransitive constructions399possessive suffixes: ďatə-poss and ďaðə-poss. (For the paradigm, see Section
4.1.1 in Chapter 3). The pronominal addressee is mostly covert; it appears overtly
only to express emphasis. The personal pronoun can precede the postposition
(4b). If the special interrogative speech act verb kumunsa ‘what tell’ is used, the
theme argument cannot be expressed lexically (4a).

JDH_00_Musuna_flkd.0771.2.2
Physical Transfer
The recipient of a verb expressing physical transfer is expressed by a postpositional construction with na ‘to, near’, if it is pronominal. It takes a possessive
suffix from the oblique series which denotes the person of the recipient. This
postposition is optionally accompanied by a personal pronoun. The recipient400chapter 11takes the preverbal position, and the theme is always placed before the recipient, but it is possible to insert another phrase between them. So, in sentence
(6a) the agent, and in (6b), an anaphoric pronoun is inserted between the recipient and the theme. The word order is Th R V.

Covert Recipient and Addressee
The recipient and adressee must not be overtly expressed in a Nganasan ditransitive construction. If the recipient/addressee is a pronoun, it may also be omitted. But if the recipient/addressee is pronominal, the theme argument must
take a destinative marker (cf. Section 5, Chapter 4) and have a possessive suffix
referring to the recipient/addressee (possessive strategy). Thus, in a ditransitive
construction neither the agent nor the recipient/addressee must be expressed
by a lexical element; a morphological marker can refer to them. The agent is
encoded through verbal morphology, with the verbal personal ending, while
the recipient/addressee is encoded through nominal morphology, with the possessive suffix showing the person and number of the recipient/addressee. This
construction is illustrated with the following examples:

KES_031115_Paris_nar.320The same construction appears in passive sentences. In such cases, the agent is
never omitted, and the theme argument moves to the topic position. The recipient is expressed with the possessive suffix on the theme. The verb is always in
the reflexive conjugation and, of course, it agrees with the grammatical subject
of the sentence, that is, with the theme. This construction may occur with the
verb ‘give’ (9), but it is most often used with speech act verbs (8). In sentences
wit speech act verbs, the agent cannot be overt.

JSM_080212_Mosquitos_flkd.1612Coding the BeneficiaryThe beneficiary is an entity for whose benefit the action was performed. As can
be seen, there is a contrast between the coding of the recipient and the coding of the beneficiary. As we have seen before, the recipient NP takes the lative
marker; for a benefactive NP this is not possible, and it can either be coded with
the allative or—like a recipient—may remain covert.
2.1
Postpositional Coding
If the beneficiary is an NP or expressed with the demonstrative pronouns used
as personal pronouns, the construction is postpositional and the postposition402chapter 11ďaðiɁkü ~ ďaðükü ‘for, for the sake of’ must be used. The stem of this postposition is the postposition ďa, the origin of the other constituent is unclear.
If the beneficiary is expressed by a pronoun or demonstrative (10a) the
postposition takes the possessive suffix corresponding to person and number. This construction can only express a beneficiary, if the NP has the feature
[+human]. In other instances, the postposition is either an allative marker of
direction or expresses the meaning of ‘for the sake of’. The word order is always
beneficiary—theme.

KNT_940903_KehyLuu.178Similar to the recipient, the beneficiary can also be covert in the sentence. In
this case, the destinative suffix and the possessive suffix indicate the person
and the number of the beneficiary, as seen in sentences in (11). The NP marked
with the destinative is the theme of the ditransitive construction. The agent
of the sentence is almost always expressed with only the verbal ending, if it is
overt as in (11c), it takes the clause-initial position.

ChND_99_Barusi_flkd.063When destinative NPs function as subjects of the intransitive sentence, the construction can also be qualified as benefactive. This construction occurs rarely.
The NP appears in the subject position and takes the destinative suffix (-tǝ/-ðǝ)
and the possessive suffix. The possessive suffix indicates the number and person of the beneficiary. Subject destinative NPs take possessive markers for the
nominative only. This construction is not very frequent, only 10 % of the benefactive constructions are of this type. Most often, this sentence type contains
the verbs tujsʲa ‘come’, ŋǝtumsa ‘become visible; be born’ and the negative particle ďaŋku. For a depiction of the structure, see the sentences in (12). This kind
of construction appears not only in Nganasan, but also in Enets (cf. Khanina &
Shluisky 2014).

ChND_041212_Girl_flkd.1413Coding the ThemeAs has already been mentioned, the theme of the ditransitive sentence in most
cases remains in the accusative. Passive sentences are exceptions; for more on
this, see Section 1.3 above. With imperative forms, the theme is in the nominative; for more on the form of the imperative object, see Section 1.2.4, Chapter 10.
The personal suffix of the verb may also indicate the direct object, thus the
theme can be overt under certain circumstances, as in (13a–b). However, this
is only possible, if the theme has already been indicated in the preceding sentences, so in the given sentences it would be possible to use only the personal
pronoun. In these cases, the personal endings on the verb are used to indicate
the theme instead of a personal pronoun. Normally, the agent in such cases is
also not overt.

"1Sentence NegationThe default way in which a sentence is negated is through the common negative
auxiliary ńisɨ, which is used in declarative as well as non-declarative sentences.
Section 1.1 deals with standard negation, while Section 1.2 describes negation
in non-declarative sentences. Negation of non-verbal, existential, locative, and
possessive sentences is discussed in sections 1.3 and 1.4.
1.1
Standard Negation
The predicate in the narrow sense is negated through the inflected negative
auxiliary ńisɨ in the negative phrase (NegP), which is accompanied by the connegative form of the main verb. In a negative phrase, the auxiliary always takes
mood and tense markers and inflectional suffixes and it agrees with the subject
in person and number, and, if the object is lexically covert, with the object in
number. The negated verb takes the connegative marker -ʔ, which is homonymous with the 2sg imperative marker. The connegative form of the verb isʲa
‘be’ is suppletive: ŋuəɁ. From a typological point of view, the standard negation
is asymmetric (cf. Misetamo 2005). This means that negative sentences differ
from affirmative ones not only in that there is a negative element present, but
also through structural differences. The paradigm of the negative auxiliary is as
follows.

attach to imperfective verbs (-NTU and -NTA1, cf. Section 2.2 in Chapter 5).
Note, however, that the aspect value of the construction depends on the value
of the main verb and not on the aspect value of the auxiliary. Thus, the construction ńindɨm tuɁ does not mean ‘I am not coming’, but ‘I did not come’408chapter 12because the aspect value of the main verb tujsʲa ‘come’ is [+perfective]. According to Gusev (2015: 107), in the Taimyr subdialect, the negative auxiliary can take
a perfective aorist marker (-Ɂǝ). However, there are only very few examples of
the auxiliary with a perfective aorist marker, thus this form is very rare. Sentences (1a–b) show a verb inflected in the common imperfective form, while
sentence (2) is an example of a verb form inflected in its perfective form.

KES_080726_Family_nar.031The negative auxiliary can take not only tense and mood markers, but derivational suffixes as well. The available data suggest that while aspectual and voice
makers tend to appear on the lexical verb, Aktionsart is marked on the negative auxiliary, as in sentences (5a–c) below. If a negative sentence is transposed
into passive voice, the main verb takes the passive suffix, as illustrated by sentences (6a–b). The distribution of grammatical categories is summarized in
Table 12.2.
The following sentences provide examples of the distribution. The most frequent derivational suffix on the negative auxiliary is the iterative suffix (-Kə),
but there are examples with habituative (-mUNHA), attenuative (-btA), imperfective (-NTə), and the resultative (-Ɂkə) suffix as well.

TLN_061021_MyGrandmother_nar.003The negative auxiliary cannot be negated, but it can be used with other auxiliaries such as ǝku-/ǝkɨ- ‘maybe’ and ŋuəlɨ- ‘how can I not, of course’, as in (8–9).
(For auxiliaries, see Section 3.3, Chapter 3.) If the auxiliary ǝku-/ǝkɨ- is used,
the main verb (in this case, the negative auxiliary) always precedes this auxiliary and takes the connegative marker. On the other hand, the negated lexical
verb must also take the connegative marker. The negated main verb follows
the auxiliary ǝku-/ǝkɨ-. This means that in the sentence two verbs appear in the
connegative form: the negative auxiliary, and the negated lexical verb.

The Negation of Non-declarative Sentences
As mentioned in Table 12.2, the mood markers appear on the negative auxiliary.
Synchronically, there is no separate prohibitive verb. However, it is possible thatnegation413historically the negative auxiliary (ńi-) and the prohibitive verb were different
(see Helimski 2004b). The prohibitive verb was documented by Castrén as having the form ńe-,1 but in the present state of the language, there is no reason to
differentiate two separate morphemes for these functions which are formally
the same (see 12 below). The negative auxiliary can freely take mood markers,
except for the abessive marker. The following pairs of sentences show imperative and prohibitive structures. The prohibitive forms have no special structure.
(12) a. tu-Ɂ

tu-Ɂ
come-imp.2sg neg.aux-imp.2sg come-cng

b. mətu-ðə
→ ńi-tə
mətu-Ɂ
cut-imp.2sg.obc neg.aux-imp.2sg.obc cut-cng
‘Cut it!’
‘Don’t cut it!’
The sentence pair (12a–b) above shows verbs with subjective and objective conjugation suffixes. The prohibitive sentences show that the imperative 2sg and
the connegative suffix (cng) are formally the same (-Ɂ). Furthermore, it is also
demonstrated that there is no special prohibitive suffix or special prohibitive
negative element. The imperative suffix is attached to the negative auxiliary.
The difference in the form of the suffix in sentence (12b) is due to consonant
gradation (cf. Section 7.1 in Chapter 2) and is not connected to negation. The
lexical verb is in its connegative form and positioned after the negative auxiliary. The sentences above also illustrate that although the structure itself is
asymmetrical, the paradigm is symmetrical. Each imperative form has its corresponding prohibitive counterpart.
The negative auxiliary can take other mood markers as well. The following sentence pair illustrates this with forms bearing the irrealis marker. The
declarative-negative pair shows that the negative auxiliary takes the same
mood marker as the main verb in the positive sentence. The negative element
is the standard negative auxiliary.

6chapter 8Coordination within NP and Comitative ConstructionsTwo noun phrases can be coordinated in four ways: (1) comitative strategy, (2)
postpositional comitative strategy, (3) with the ŋonəə ‘also, and’ conjunction,
(4) and with simple enumeration without a conjunction (juxtaposition). The
second and the third strategies are interchangeable. Similar to Enets, the double dual strategy for the lexeme ‘parents’ is also attested. It is described in detail
in Chapter 4, Section 2.2.
The most common strategy to combine two NPs is the juxtaposition (strategy 4). This is illustrated by sentences (41a–b). The predicate always agrees with
the logical subject, thus it appears in dual form.

JSM_080212_Hibula_flkd.077NP coordination with the ŋonǝǝ conjunction is not common, but, probably
under Russian influence, it is used as in sentences (42a–b). However, it must
be noted that in the corpus this strategy is not attested, all examples stem from
elicited data. The Russian conjunction i ‘and’ is not attested in NP coordination;
however, it is used by less fluent speaker as clause connector. (For examples see
Section 1 in Chapter 13.)

ChND, 2008the structure of the noun phrase327The Comitative strategy with the comitative case (-na) can be used only if
the coordinated nouns are in the subject position. In this case, one of the two
NPs is marked by the comitative case. This construction can be replaced with
another coordination device without altering the meaning, for example with
simple juxtaposition (compare sentences (42b) and (43b)). The comitative construction expresses pluralization of participants in the sentence.4 These participants are typically human or at least animate and have the same semantic
role, in most cases, agent. The sentence has two agents. The second agent is
expressed by the comitative. As mentioned in Chapter 4 the use of the comitative case is not wide spread. The following sentences show the comitative
structure.

"word formation531Verbs derived with the suffix -ir can have the meaning ‘play with S’, if the
stem refers to an object that one can play with: kartə ‘cards.r’ > kartə-ir-sʲa
‘play cards’; ńuəði͡aj ‘doll’ > ńuəði͡a-ir-sʲa ‘play with a doll’. The derivate is always
imperfective. (For the homonym form, see Section 6.3.1 above.)
6.3.2
Deverbal Derivation
Nganasan is rich in productive deverbal verb-forming suffixes.
6.3.2.1
Stative and Medial Verbs
The suffix -ÜC (-i, ü) attaches to verbs of motion, such as ‘sit down, stand up’.
The resulting verb refers to the state arising as the result of this motion. The
suffix deletes the stem-final vowel, e.g. ŋomtəsʲa ‘sit down’ > ŋomtüsʲa ‘be sitting’; nənsuďi ‘stop’ > nəńďisɨ ‘be standing’; bənəďa ‘lie down’ > bənüsʲa ‘be
lying’.
There is a non-productive medial suffix -n. It is attached to a bound stem and
forms medial verbs such as hinsʲi ‘be boiling, be cooking’ (cf. hiriďi ‘cook’). This
suffix appears as part of the frequentative suffix -Ɂnar, and it exists in Nenets
as well (cf. pi-năsʲ ‘be cooking’ (ipfv).’
6.3.2.2
Transitive and Causative Suffixes
As a deverbal transitive-causative suffix, the suffix -btU is a very frequent and
productive suffix. Consonant-final stems are followed by the -tu and -tɨ allomorphs. After -j-final stems, the suffix-initial /t-/ is palatalized (-ču, -či), e.g.
ŋəmsa ‘eat’ > ŋəməbtusa ‘feed’; hu͡aŋkuďa ‘get drunk’ > hu͡aŋgubtusa ‘make
somebody drunk’; mənəgəjsʲa ‘fall down’ > mənəgəjčuďa ‘drop’.

KES-ChND_080725_Childhood_conv.052532chapter 16The suffix -rU is a rare and unproductive transitive-causative suffix. Words
with this suffix are lexicalized, e.g. hiriďi ‘cook a meal’; hursərɨsɨ ‘send back’;
ŋəńərusa ‘surprise’.
The complex suffix -RUbtU is formed from two transitive suffixes, from -rU
and -btU, e.g. hotəďa ‘write down’ > hotə-rubtu-ďa ‘make somebody write’;
kotuďa ‘kill’ > kotu-rubtu-ďa ‘have somebody killed’; kontuďa ‘take away’ >
kontu-rubtu-ďa ‘have something carried’; ŋəmsa ‘eat’ > ŋəm-lubtu-sa ‘have
somebody fed’.
6.3.2.3
Aspectual Derivation
Although aspect is a term mainly used in the field of syntax and semantics,
in Nganasan (and in other Samoyedic languages) it is applicable in morphology as well, as aspect may be expressed by morphological means. One of the
most frequently used and most productive derivational suffixes is the imperfective suffix -NTə. It appears on perfective verbs, and the derived verb is always
imperfective, e.g. hotəďa ‘write down’ > hoðə-tə-sa ‘write’; hu͡ansa ‘put down’ >
hu͡an-tə-ďa ‘put’.
Another frequently used suffix is the durative suffix -Kuj (-guj). However, this
suffix is not productive, it most often attaches to verbs ending in -btU transitivecausative suffix to form the imperfective member of the pair, e.g. karčalə-btɨďi ‘ruffle [perf]’ > karčalə-btɨ-kuj-sʲi ‘ruffle [imperf]’. Other imperfectivizing
suffixes express iterative, durative, habituative or frequentative meanings (see
Section 6.3.2.5 below).
6.3.2.4
Inchoative and Resultative Suffixes
Nganasan also has perfectivizing suffixes, which express a normally inchoative,
resultative or temporal meaning. One of the most frequently used derivational
suffixes is the inchoative suffix -LƏ (-lə, -lʲi) with the meaning ‘begin to S’, e.g.
hiďisʲi ‘laugh’ > hisʲi-lə-sʲi ‘begin to laugh’; ďaŋhɨďi ‘shine’ > ďaŋhɨ-lə-sɨ ‘begin
to shine’; ďorəďa ‘cry’ > ďorə-lə-sa ‘begin to cry’. This suffix can also express
semelfactivity, i.e. to indicate that the action happened only once. The stem of
such verbs is always a durative verb referring to a lengthy action, e.g. ďorəďa
‘cry’ > ďorə-lə-sa ‘cry out’; səŋü-r-sa ‘look’ cf. səŋü-lə-sa ‘catch sight of’; hiďisʲi
‘laugh’ > hisʲi-lə-sʲi ‘burst out laughing’. In contrast to Nenets (cf. Nikolaeva 2014:
46), the derivative in Nganasan does not belong to the reflexive inflectional
class, the verb can be conjugated by subjective or objective conjugation as well.
The inchoative-resultative suffix-Ɂkə is a very frequent and productive derivational suffix. It appears on the S1 stem of the verb. The derivative is always a
perfective verb (S1: V+-Ɂkə → VPerf). The meaning of the derived word is ‘begin
to do something and probably finish doing it as well’; ďarəðɨ-sɨ ‘be ill’: ďarəðɨ-word formation533Ɂkə-ďi ‘fall ill’; kitə-ďi ‘wake somebody up’: kitə-Ɂkə-sa ‘begin waking somebody
up’; ŋəm-sa ‘eat’: ŋəmə-Ɂkə-sa ‘begin to eat’

‘We, being older children, began to go to school. (lit.: ‘began to write’).’
KES-ChND_080725_Childhood_conv.046There is a temporal suffix -Kəl (-kəl, -gəl) with the meaning ‘at the moment’.
This rare suffix describes actions that are limited in time. The meaning of the
derivatives is similar to the meaning of words with an inchoative suffix, e.g.
barə-ďa ‘wait’ > barə-gəl-sa ‘wait a little’; bi͡arə-ďi ‘open’ > bi͡arə-gəl-sɨ ‘open a
little’; ďeru-sa ‘not to know’ > ďeru-gəl-sa ‘not to know a little’.
The intentional suffix -ɁhA2n (-Ɂhu͡an, -Ɂhi͡an) attaches to the S1 or S3 stem
of an imperfective or perfective verb. The emerging verb is always perfective
(S1/S3: Vperf/imperf + -ɁHA2n → Vperf). The derivates typically occur next to
motion verbs as a purposive adjunct, but motion verbs themselves can also take
this suffix, e.g. čiiɁni͡ar-hi͡an-sɨ ‘intend to enter’, tujsʲa ‘come’ > tuuɁnar-hu͡an-sa
‘intend to come’.

Frequentative, Attenuative, Iterative and Habituative Suffixes
The frequentative suffix -r is primarily used as an aspect marker: it forms imperfective verbs, but it also carries its original, frequentative meaning, e.g. ŋəmsa
‘eat (up)’ > ŋəmursa ‘eat’; mənəgəisʲa ‘fall down’ > mənəgəirsʲa ‘fall down usually’; laŋəɁkəsa ‘shout’ cf. laŋürsʲa ‘shout occasionally’; tolɨďi ‘steal something’
> tolarsa ‘steal occasionally’
Words with the suffix -ɁnA2r (-(Ɂ)nar, -(Ɂ)ni͡ar) describe events that are
repeated within irregular intervals in a certain period of time. The derivational
suffix is morphologically complex. It is made up of two suffixes with a frequentative meaning, although the -na morpheme is not used as a separate
derivational suffix in present day Nganasan. The meaning of words with the
-r frequentative suffix (see above) describe events repeated more regularly, as
the sentences in the corpus show. Examples: büü-ďa ‘go away’ > büü-Ɂnar-sa ‘go
away more than once’; kou-ďa ‘drop behind’ > kou-Ɂnar-sa ‘drop behind more
than once’; tuj-sʲa ‘arrive’ > tuu-Ɂnar-sa ‘come’.

KNT, 1994The suffix -btU is also used as an attenuative suffix which forms attenuative
(diminutive) verbs (‘to S a bit’), e.g. ďorə-ďa ‘cry’ > ďorə-btu-sa ‘cry a bit’; bi͡arəďi ‘open’ > bi͡arə-btɨ-sɨ ‘open a bit [e.g. a door]’; ďilə-ďi ‘lift’ > ďilə-btɨ-sɨ ‘lift a

habitual actions (the situation happens regularly), e.g. ďoðürsa ‘walk’ > ďoðürmumba-sa ‘walk usually’; ŋəmursa ‘eat’ > ŋəmurmumbasa ‘eat often’; ŋatəďa

KNT, 1996There is a distributive suffix with the form -A2lU (-alu, -i͡alɨ) and with the meaning ‘to S very much, abundantly’. This suffix forms imperfective verbs from
perfective verbs. It deletes the final vowel of the stem.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.445One of the most interesting suffixes in Nganasan is the volitive (desiderative) suffix -nA2NTU (-ni͡antɨ, -nantu, -nandu, -ni͡andɨ), which express the light
modal meaning ‘want to S’. The suffix turns imperfective or perfective verbs
into imperfective verbs, e.g. hoðətəsa ‘write’ > hoðətə-nantu-sa ‘want to write’;
kundu͡asa ‘sleep’ > kundu͡a-nantu-sa ‘want to sleep’; ńilɨďi ‘live’ > ńilɨ-nantu-ďa
‘want to live’; heðitɨsɨ ‘go’ > heðɨtɨ-nantu-sa ‘want to go’; ŋəmsa ‘eat’ > ŋəm-nantu-536chapter 16sa ‘want to eat’. This suffix cannot be attached to the negative auxiliary, in the
negative clause it appears on the main verb (49b).

TKF_061105_FoxFosterling_flk.116In Nganasan expressing the concept ‘wanting’ is also possible using verbal concept. There are two verbs with the meaning ‘want’: kərbuďa and hujsʲi. If no
other verbal element occurs in the sentences, instead of the volitive suffix, one
of these verbs must be used. The verb hujsʲi can have an argument as direct
object, which also stays in accusative (50b). The verb kərbuďa cannot have an
direct object as argument. (More on the distribution of the verbs see Jark 2018.)

Deadverbial Stative Verbs
The suffix -TU (-ðɨ, -ðu, -tu, -tɨ) attaches to postpositions or adverbs. The resulting verb refers to the state arising as the result of motion. The derivative is
always imperfective, e.g. ŋilʲə ‘downwards’ > ŋilʲəðusa ‘be down’; huə ‘backwards’
> huəðusa ‘be in the back’; ńerə ‘the front’ > ńerəðɨsɨ ‘be in the front’.

KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.0766.4
Adverbial Derivation
Adverbs can be formed from adjectives or nouns with several derivational suffixes or certain case suffixes, for example with the genitive plural suffixes -Ɂ
(ńaagəǝ: ńaagəiɁ ‘good’ [adv]) and with the prolative suffixes -mənu (ərəkərə:
ərəkərə-mənu ‘beautifully’). Both suffixes form adverbs of manner. (For the case
suffixes, see Section 3, Chapter 4).
The caritive suffix -KA2lʲi creates adverbs of manner or circumstance from
nouns, e.g. ŋənduj ‘boat’: ŋəndujkalʲi ‘without a boat’; tuj ‘fire’: tuj-kalʲi ‘without
fire’; tala ‘happiness’: tala-kaľi ‘unhappily’. Another privative denominal suffix is the suffix -KA2j. Adverbs ending in this suffix are generally used together
with the word ičuə, which is the present participle form of the copula (isʲa), e.g.
sʲejmɨ ‘eye’: sʲejmɨgaj ičuə ‘blind’ [‘being without eyes’]; čiirü ‘cloud’: čiirügi͡aj
ičuə ‘clear’ [‘being without clouds’]; nɨ ‘woman’: nɨgi͡aj ičuə ‘single’ [‘being without a wife’]; ńuə ‘child’: ńuəgaj ičuə ‘childless’ [‘being without a child’]. The
usage of these two suffixes is illustrated with the following sentence pair.

KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.066The suffix -səbtə has a sociative meaning (‘together with S forming a single
entity’) and forms adverbs from nouns: ŋuhu ‘sleeve’ > ŋubusəbtə ‘together with
a sleeve’; taa ‘reindeer’ > taasəbtə ‘together with a reindeer’; kahi͡a ‘clothes of a
shaman’ > kabi͡asəbtə ‘together with the clothes of a shaman’. For more examples and a description of comitative/sociative construction see Section 6 in

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.0307Clitic-like MorphemesThere are some morphemes in Nganasan whose morphological status is not
determined with certainty. Based on the way they are used, they form an intermediate category between derivational suffixes and clitics. They are characterized by not behaving consistently: their position can depend on the speaker or
the part of speech of the word as well. Practically all of them can co-occur with
verbal and nominal stems, but not with the same frequency: some morphemes
occur more frequently with nominal stems. But their position in relation to
each other is set, although they do not occur together very often. The following
morphemes belong to this group: -Küə, -KüCmü, -ŋUTU, -ŋA2lə, -Kəlʲičə, -btA2,
-Cčǝ and -uɁ. In the discussion below, I will refer to these morphemes as “cliticlike morphemes”.","[549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557]"

Onset
As Table 2.9 above shows, the onset can be filled or empty, however, as has been
mentioned above in Section 2.2, if the onset is empty, only the following vowels
can occur word-initially: ə, a, i, ü or u. Furthermore, only two loanwords (ukuďarɨ ‘loon, diver’ and urubaakə ‘shirt’) begin with /u/ and only one loan begin
with /ü/ (ürüsak ‘rucksack’). Diphthongs never occur in the word-initial position. In (8), examples of empty onsets are given.

$__VThe filled onset cannot be complex, thus ancient Nganasan words cannot
begin with consonant clusters. All the words which begin with consonant clusters are recent Russian loanwords without any phonological adaptation, such
as ʃkola ‘school’. Simple onsets occur word-initially or word-internally. Constraints for word-initial consonants are detailed in 1.2 above. As has already
been described, the following consonants cannot appear in the word-initial
position: /d/, /j/, /g/, /ð/ and /Ɂ/. In the Vadeyev dialect /j/ can occur in wordinitial position, in this variety of Nganasan the original /j/ is not converted into
/ď/, cf. Avam ďa allative postposition vs. Vadeyev ja. However, word-internally,
only /j/ and [d] cannot occur in an onset. These constraints are summarized in
Table 2.10 above.
The list (9) below provides some examples for simple onsets in both the
word-initial and word-internal positions.

be filled by any vowel. Nuclei with diphthongs are complex, while vowel sequences do not occur in a nucleus, since from the point of view of phonology;
they are syllabified into two syllables (cf. Section 5 below). If the onset is empty,
only five vowels are possible as a nucleus (ə, a, i, ü and u), and any vowel can
occur in non-word-initial syllables, however, the non-central mid vowels (e and
o) occur only as variants of /ə/ in the speech of some speakers. In general, there
is no restriction on nuclei: any vowel can occur in a closed or an open syllable:

Coda
The coda is either empty (unfilled) or simple, there are no complex codas
attested, thus consonant clusters in codas are not permitted. There are two
types of empty codas. Some empty codas are truly unfilled, while other codas
are empty because they have an empty slot (where an empty slot does not equal
an empty coda, for empty slot see Section 4.4 below).
Consonant clusters appear intervocalically, these are coda–onset sequences,
as in ďeb.tu ‘goose’. Both empty and simple codas can be found word-internally
and word-finally. However, in a word-final simple coda only /j/, /m/, /ŋ/, /r/
and /Ɂ/ are present. (For more details, see in Table 2.4 in Section 1.2 above.) In
word-internal codas except for the glottal stop /Ɂ/ and /b/, all obstruents are
prohibited.","[82, 83, 84, 85]"
