"4.3 Polar questions
 Answers to polar questionsA polar question has as answers a pair of polar opposites, positive and negative. The
answers to Is it ready? are It is ready and It is not ready (or equivalently Yes and No, or Yes,
it is and No, it’s not, and so on). The propositional content of one answer is expressed in
the question itself, and that of the other is obtained by reversing the polarity.5
Usually it is the positive that is expressed in the question, but it can also be the negative,
as in the biased question Isn’t it ready?
Choice between Yes and No determined by answer
Yes and no are used in positive and negative answers respectively: the choice between
them is determined by the polarity of the answer, with the polarity of the question
being irrelevant. Thus Yes, it is and No, it’s not are answers to both Is it ready? and Isn’t it
ready? Yes on its own, however, is relatively unlikely to be used as a response to a negative
question.
 The form of polar questionsPolar questions prototypically have the form of a closed interrogative clause, as in Is it
breathing? in [4i]. They do not always have this form, however; other possibilities are
shown in:
[6]i Your aim that evening, then, was to go to the discotheque?
ii So you went to the party but your brother stayed at home?
iii Another cup of tea?",[888]
"One grammatical difference between the two kinds of question is that or cannot be
paired with either when it is the marker of an alternative question. Are you free on either
Tuesday or Wednesday?, for example, is unambiguously polar. This explains the anomaly
of examples like Would you prefer to watch with the light either on or off? or (to an
expectant mother) Are you hoping for either a boy or a girl? – the either forces a polar,
yes/no, interpretation which conflicts with normal assumptions that there are no other
possibilities than those expressed.
 No alternative interrogative clause type corresponding to alternative questionAlthough [8i] and [ii] are, semantically, different kinds of question, they do not belong,
grammatically, to different clause types. This is one reason why we have adopted different
terminologies for subclassification at the two levels. Semantically we distinguish three
kinds of question on the basis of the way they define the set of answers: polar, alternative,
and variable. But grammatically there are just two subtypes of interrogative: closed and
open.
The reason we do not treat the or of alternative questions as a clause type marker is that
the coordination in which it figures may be between clauses, as in [7ii]. This is a clausecoordination, not a clause, so the issue of what clause type it belongs to doesn’t arise. And as
for the component clauses, is it genuine and is it a hoax, they have the same syntactic form as
clauses expressing polar questions. Note that with embedded questions the clause subordinator whether can appear in both coordinates: I don’t know whether it’s genuine or whether it’s
a hoax. From a grammatical point of view, therefore, alternative questions are distinguished
from polar questions not by the system of clause type but by a special use of coordination.
 Polar-alternative questionsA special type of alternative question has the alternatives consisting of a positive and its
negative counterpart. Questions of this kind are logically equivalent to polar questions,
and we refer to them as polar-alternative questions:
[10] i a. Are you ready or are you not ready?
b. Are you ready or aren’t you ready?
c. Are you ready or aren’t you?
d. Are you ready or not?
e. Are you, or are you not, ready?
ii Are you ready?[polar-alternative][polar]§ 4.4 Alternative questionsAs shown in [i], the second coordinate can be reduced by the omission of repeated
material, and its position relative to the first can be varied, as in [ie]. With embedded
polar-alternative questions there is also the possibility of having or not adjacent to the
subordinator whether : They want to know whether or not you’re ready.
The questions in [10] are logically equivalent in that they define the same set of answers.
They do so, however, in different ways. Polar [ii] expresses a single proposition and the
answers are provided by this and its polar opposite, whereas the polar-alternatives in [i]
express two propositions, each of which provides an answer. The distinction between polar,
alternative, and variable questions is based on the way they define the set of answers, and
in accordance with the definitions given above, therefore, [i] and [ii] belong to different
categories despite their logical equivalence. The term ‘polar-alternative’ is to be understood
as denoting a subclass of alternative questions.
Apart from the issue of how the answers are derived, there are two other respects in which
[10i] behave like alternative questions rather than polar ones. These involve the subordinate
constructions illustrated in:
[11] i a. I wonder/doubt whether it is alive.
b. I wonder/∗doubt whether it is alive or dead.
c. I wonder/∗doubt whether it is alive or not.
ii a. ∗I’m marrying her whether you like her.
b. I’m marrying her whether you like her or hate her.
c. I’m marrying her whether you like her or not.[polar]
[alternative]
[polar-alternative]
[polar]
[alternative]
[polar-alternative]While verbs like wonder license interrogative complements expressing all three kinds of
question, doubt accepts only the polar type: the polar-alternative is excluded just as other
alternative questions are (see Ch. 11, §5.3.3). Conversely, the ungoverned exhaustive conditional construction [ii] excludes the polar type, while allowing polar-alternatives as well as
other alternative questions (see Ch. 11, §5.3.6).
 Pragmatic differences between polar and polar-alternative questionsAlthough polar questions are logically equivalent to their polar-alternative counterparts,
there are considerable pragmatic differences between them. The polar version is simpler
and much more frequent: it can be regarded as the default version. We draw attention
here to a selection of contexts favouring one rather than the other of the two.
(a) Polar-alternative emphasises choice
The explicit expression of the negative often has an emphatic effect. One reason for my
emphasising the choice might be that you have failed to give a satisfactory response,
i.e. an answer, to a previous polar question. In such a context, the polar-alternative
question is likely to have an impatient, hectoring, or petulant tone, conveying “Make
up your mind”, “Give me an answer”, or the like. The different versions of the polaralternative, as illustrated in [10i], vary in the extent to which they convey such emotive
meaning. In general, the less elliptical the form, the greater the emotive meaning is likely
to be: compare Are you going or not? with the more insistent Are you going or aren’t you?
Typically, however, the version where the second coordinate is interpolated within the
first, as in [10ie], is the most hectoring.
(b) Polar-alternative emphasises the exhaustiveness of the two alternatives
[12] a. Was it good?
b. Was it good or not?
The answers to both polar [a] and polar-alternative [b] are simply It was good and It
wasn’t good, but (no doubt because of the tendency for the negative It wasn’t good to871872Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary forcebe interpreted as “It was bad” – see Ch. 9, §5) [a] will often receive such non-answer
responses as It was okay, It wasn’t too bad, and the like. Such responses locate ‘it’ in
the middle ground between good and bad. The polar-alternative can serve, then, to
insist on a simple, unequivocal choice between ‘good’ and ‘not good’ – and again the
emotive meaning of impatience or the like will be more evident in the less elliptical
versions.
(c) Polar version preferred when answers are of unequal status for the speaker
[13] i Have you any idea how much these things cost?
ii Will they agree to the proposal, do you think, or not?
iii Is it the sixteenth today?
I might use [i] rhetorically, to convey that I believe that you haven’t any idea of the
cost: in this use (which is not the only one, of course) it would be a biased question,
one where I am predisposed to one answer over another. In this case it would be very
unnatural to add or not, for this would take away the rhetorical effect. Negative polar
questions – e.g. Don’t you like it? – are always biased, and will never be pragmatically
equivalent to polar-alternatives. The polar-alternative, by expressing both positive and
negative propositions, tends to assign them equal status.
In a case like [13ii] the effect is to give you full freedom to choose between them:
it avoids any appearance of according greater likelihood to one answer. Especially in
combination with the parenthetical do you think, the effect of the polar-alternative may
then be to suggest a certain diffidence or deference to the addressee.
Bias is not the only factor that can make the answers of unequal status. Consider
[13iii], for example. I might say this when my concern is to find out what date it is,
and in that case a “yes” answer gives me the desired information but a “no” does not
(so that a co-operative response would go further: No, it’s the fifteenth, say). For this
reason, the answers are of unequal value, and in such a context the polar-alternative
version would be very unlikely. There are numerous other ways in which the answers might be of unequal status. To give just one, note that we say Are you awake?,
not (normally) Are you awake or not? The latter suggests that positive and negative
answers are on a par, but they are not. If you are awake you can answer Yes, but
if you’re not you can’t answer No, so only one of the answers is a possible (true)
response.","[890, 891, 892]"
"4.4 Alternative questions
 Answers to alternative questionsAlternative questions have as answers a set of alternatives given in the question itself.
For example, the answers to Is it right or wrong? are It’s right and It’s wrong, which are
derivable directly from the question. This example contains two alternatives, but there
may be more: e.g. three in Would you like to meet in the morning, the afternoon, or the
evening?
5Other terms for polar question include ‘yes/no question’, ‘general question’, ‘total question’, ‘nexus-question’.",[888]
"§ 4.4 Alternative questionsThe propositional content of an alternative question is, or is logically equivalent to, a disjunction of propositions, disjunction being the relation expressed by or (see Ch. 15, §2.2.1).
Each of these propositions gives the content of one of the answers. The propositional content
of Is it alive or dead?, for example, is “It is alive or dead”, which is logically equivalent to “It
is alive or it is dead”.
 The form of alternative questionsThe essential feature of alternative questions is the coordinator or which relates the
alternatives. The or-coordination is normally prosodically marked by a rise on the first
coordinate and a fall on the final one, as indicated in [7], where we put  after a word
or phrase that is uttered with rising pitch and  after a word or phrase that is uttered
with falling pitch:
[7]i Is it a boyor a girl ?
[closed interrogative]
ii Is it genuineor is it a hoax?
[coordination of closed interrogatives]
iii You’re staying here, or coming with us?
[declarative]
iv Teaor coffee?
[clause fragment]With multiple coordination the intermediate coordinates take rising intonation, like the
first: Would you like orange juice, lemonade , or coke?
Alternative questions usually have closed interrogative syntax. In [7i] the or-coordination is within the clause, whereas in [ii] it is between clauses. In the latter case, then, we
have two interrogative clauses but a single question. It is also possible for an alternative
question to have the form of a declarative, as in [iii], or of a clause fragment, as in [iv].
Prosodically marked declaratives, however, are much less readily used for alternative
questions than for polar ones; this is no doubt because questions with declarative form
are biased, and alternative questions tend to be neutral.6
 Or in alternative and polar questionsThe coordinator or is an essential component of an alternative question, but it may also
occur incidentally in a polar question: Will I be able to get some tea or coffee at the bus
station? Here the answers are Yes, you will and No, you won’t: I’m not asking which drink
is available but whether or not I’ll be able to get one or other of the drinks.
In writing there will often be ambiguity between an alternative question and a polar
question that happens to contain an or-coordination, but the two cases are distinguished
in speech by the intonation. An alternative question, we have noted, has a rise on the first
coordinate and a fall on the last: a polar question will not distinguish the coordinates in
this way but will normally have a rising pitch on the last:
[8]i Are you free on Tuesday or Wednesday?
ii Are you free on Tuesday or Wednesday?[alternative]
[polar]The answers to the alternative question [i] are I am free on Tuesday and I am free on
Wednesday. The polar question [ii] is equivalent to Are you free on Tuesday or Wednesday,
or not?, its answers being Yes, I am free on Tuesday or Wednesday and No, I’m not free
on Tuesday or Wednesday. It should again be borne in mind, however, that while the
answers to the alternative and polar questions are sharply distinct, the responses may
6A special case is where the alternatives are identical: Is it hot, or is it hot? This serves as an indirect emphatic
statement, “It is remarkably hot”.","[888, 889]"
"[single-variable Q][singulary answers]
[multiple response]With [ii] we have a straightforward singulary answer: all the books were bought at one
place. Answer [iii] is still singulary, but as the books were bought at more than one place
a coordinate phrase is used to give the value of the variable. This situation then implicitly raises the multi-variable question of which books were bought at which shop, and [iv]
gives the answer to this question, not to [i]: it gives more information than is needed to
answer the question to which it was a response. As we have noted, a co-operative participant
commonly provides more information than is directly asked for. The difference in directness can be brought out by contrasting the anomaly of [23i] with the naturalness of [ii]:875876Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force[23] i #I know that she bought these books at Heffer’s and Dillon’s, but I don’t know where she
bought these books.
ii I know that she bought these books at Heffer’s and Dillon’s, but I don’t know where she
bought which.
The single-variable where she bought these books in [i] is the embedded counterpart of [22i].
Example [23i] is anomalous because it is self-contradictory. Thus to know [22iii] is to know
the answer to [22i], even in a context where [22iv] is true: information about the pairing
of books with shops is not part of the answer. The multi-variable where she bought which in
[23ii] is the embedded counterpart of Where did she buy which?, and the naturalness of the
example shows that to know [22iii] is not sufficient to know the answer to this latter question:
in the multi-variable case, information about the pairing is part of the answer.
 Juxtaposition of variable and polar or alternative questionsIt is not uncommon for a variable question to be followed by a polar or alternative
question which pragmatically supersedes it:
[24] i What’s her name? Is it Anne?
ii What’s her name? Is it Anne or Anna?
In [i] the polar question suggests an answer to the variable one. If the answer is positive,
then answering the second also provides the answer to the first – though the typical form,
Yes, shows that it is given in response to the polar question. If the answer is negative,
then another answer to the variable question is needed – No, it’s Anna (as we saw above,
this kind of response is often given when the variable question is merely implicit). In
[ii] the alternative question reformulates the variable one, narrowing down the range
of possible answers; this time, whatever the answer to the second question is, it will
simultaneously be an answer to the first. (To respond with Neither: it’s Amy is not to
answer the alternative question but to reject its presupposition: see §6.1 below.)
In either the polar or the alternative case, the second question will often be elliptically reduced:
[25] i What’s her name? Anne?
ii What’s her name? Anne or Anna?
Such reduction will be particularly likely when the full form would involve more lexical
repetition than is the case with [24]: Who do you think I am? (Do you think I am) Father
Christmas?; What are you going to give him? (Are you going to give him) a book or just money?
We have punctuated the questions in [24] and [25] as separate sentences, but they could
also be integrated into a single written sentence: e.g., for [24], What’s her name – Anne? With
an alternative question, but not a polar, they can be separated simply by a comma: What’s her
name, Anne or Anna? Similarly, in speech there are different degrees of prosodic integration
between the two questions. This is one of the places where it is difficult to draw a sharp
distinction between a succession of two grammatical sentences on the one hand and a single
sentence on the other.","[895, 896]"
"The choice between yes and no depends simply on the polarity of the answer – not, for
example, on agreement vs disagreement with what may be suggested by the question.
Polar questions, especially negative ones, may be biased, indicating the questioner’s
predisposition to think that one or other answer is the right one, but that has no bearing
on the choice between yes and no. In [ib], for example, the appropriate response is yes
if the car is B’s and no if it isn’t, irrespective of what A appears to expect is the case.
Similarly with answers to tag questions, as in [ii].
∗
Yes it isn’t and ∗No it is are thus ungrammatical as single clauses. In Yes it is and No
it isn’t, the yes and no can be regarded as a special type of adjunct, a polarity adjunct,
which agrees in polarity with the clause – a further case of polarity concord in English.
The adjunct can also be placed at the end of the clause, with prosodic detachment: It is,
yes and It isn’t, no. A response to [7i] with the form No, it’s Kim’s would not of course
violate the polarity concord rule, because here we have not a single clause but a sequence
of two, just as we do in No it’s not mine, it’s Kim’s.
One respect in which the agreement vs disagreement factor is relevant concerns the
choice between single-word and expanded responses. Suppose you ask Didn’t you post
the letter after all, then?, indicating that you think I didn’t. If in fact I did post it, I would
normally say Yes I did, not just Yes.
 Responses to other kinds of speech actYes and no are used in response to statements in a similar but not identical way:
[8]i A: She did very well.
ii A: She didn’t do very well.",[868]
"The possible answers to [ia] may be expressed as Yes they did have a dog and No they
didn’t have a dog: as we have said, there is no indication that one or other of these is
expected to be the right answer. The answers to [ib] (omitting henceforth the yes and
no) are They had some money and They didn’t have any money, and again the question
is quite neutral. The inclusion of any in the question does not indicate that the answer
containing any is expected. The absence of any indication that a positive answer is
favoured is sufficient to license the NPI any: this is the default existential quantifier for
polar questions. Similarly, both questions in [ii] are neutral as between the answers She
has been to Paris (at some time) and She hasn’t (ever) been to Paris. This is not so in [iii].
While [iiia] is of course neutral, [iiib] is not: it is oriented towards the negative answer
They didn’t lift a finger to help him. The form of the question is such that the positive
answer would be #They lifted a finger to help him, but since this (in the sense “They helped
him”) is anomalous, the question doesn’t cater directly for a positive answer and hence
indicates bias towards a negative one. The same applies to most of the other items in
[5iv–v].
Pragmatic nature of strength contrasts
It is important to emphasise that the difference between (say) any or ever on the one
hand and budge or lift a finger or in ages on the other is not a syntactic one. We are
not saying that the former can occur in positive interrogatives while the latter cannot.
The difference, rather, is pragmatic, having to do with the conditions under which they
can be used in the expression of questions and with the interpretation of the resulting
questions.
Take, for example, the phrase in ages, as in I haven’t tasted truffles in ages. This is not
easily contextualised in an interrogative: ?Have you tasted truffles in ages? would not be
a highly appropriate way of simply asking someone whether it had been a very long
time since they last tasted truffles. However, it might well be found in a context that
was strongly biased in a direction suggesting a negative answer, as in [14i]. Similarly, the
occurrence of the verb budge is almost entirely limited to negative clauses but one might
encounter it in a biased context like [14ii].
[14] i I don’t think you know anything about truffles or any other gourmet foods. Do you
eat truffles regularly? Have you even so much as tasted truffles in ages?
ii Did you budge an inch to let anyone else sit down? Not you; you just sat there hogging
the whole couch as usual.",[848]
"4.8 Echo questions
The prototypical use of the echo question is to question whether one has correctly heard
what the previous speaker said – heard the stimulus, as we call it. My doubt as to whether
I heard the stimulus correctly may arise because it was not perceptually clear (I may have
had difficulty making it out above some background noise) or because its content is
surprising or remarkable in such a way that I want to verify whether you did in fact say,
or mean to say, what I apparently heard.
 Polar, alternative, and variable echo questionsEcho questions are predominantly of either the polar or the variable kind, but alternative
echoes are also possible:
[51]stimulus
i A: She’s leaving on Saturday.
ii A: He gave it to Anne.
iii A: He’s proposing to resign.echo question
B: She’s leaving on Saturday?
B: He gave it to Anne or Anna?
B: He’s proposing to what?[polar]
[alternative]
[variable]The polar echo question prototypically repeats the stimulus but with a rising intonation imposed on it; like ordinary polar questions, it has Yes and No as answers. The
alternative echo question substitutes an or-coordination for part of the stimulus, and
each answer will include just one of the coordinates; it generally has the rise + fall intonation pattern of ordinary alternative questions. The variable question, which – like
the polar – prototypically also has rising intonation, substitutes an echo question word
expressing a variable for part of the stimulus, and the answers involve replacing the
variable by its possible values.
 Modification of stimulusThe stimulus is often modified by reduction – by omitting parts or replacing them by
shorter expressions such as pro-forms. An echo response to Kim is going to try and
persuade him to buy a microwave, for example, could take one of many forms, including:
[52] i To try and persuade him to buy a microwave /one /a what?
ii To buy a microwave /one /a what?
iii Kim/Who is?
And since the stimulus will normally be produced by a different speaker, there will be a
change in deictic pronouns: I like it will be echoed as You like it?, and so on.",[906]
"We distinguish systematically between categories of syntactic form and categories of
meaning or use. For example, You’re leaving ? (spoken with rising intonation) is syntactically a declarative but would be used to ask a question.
A question defines a set of possible answers. On one dimension we distinguish between
polar questions (Is this yours? – with answers Yes and No), alternative questions (Is this
Kim’s or Pat’s? – in the interpretation where the answers are Kim’s and Pat’s), and variable
questions (Whose is this ? – where the answers specify a value for the variable in the open
proposition “This is x ’s”).
Making a statement, asking a question, issuing an order, etc., are different kinds of
speech act. More specifically, when I make a statement by saying This is Kim’s, say, my
utterance has the illocutionary force of a statement. The illocutionary force typically
associated with imperative clauses is called directive, a term which covers request, order,
command, entreaty, instruction, and so on. There are, however, many different kinds of
illocutionary force beyond those associated with the syntactic categories shown in [1].
For example, the declarative I promise to be home by six would generally be used with
the force of a promise, We apologise for the delay with the force of an apology, and
so on.",[81]
"4.6 Direction questions
 Distinguished from information questions by the illocutionary forceof the answers
The great majority of questions are information questions: when used as inquiries they
seek to elicit information. The characteristic illocutionary force of their answers is that of a§ 4.6 Direction questionsstatement. There is also, however, a kind of question whose answers characteristically have
the force of directives. They seek not information but direction, and we accordingly call
them direction questions.9 The distinction applies to all three of the polar, alternative,
and variable categories of question. Compare:
[26]information question
i a. Did he open the window?
ii a. Did he do it then or later?
iii a. When did he come back?direction question
b. %Shall I open the window?
[polar]
b. %Shall I do it now or later? [alternative]
b. %When shall we come back?
[variable]The answers to the information questions are He opened the window /He didn’t open the
window; He did it then / He did it later; He came back at six (or whenever): these would
all have the force of statements. The answers to the direction questions are Open the
window / Don’t open the window; Do it now / Do it later; Come back at six (etc.): and
these would have the force of directives. With the polar questions, Yes and No could of
course be used in either case, but they would still have the statement force in response to
[a] and directive force in response to [b]. We annotate the [b] examples with ‘% ’ because
some varieties use will in place of shall here.
 Distinction between direction and information questions onlyweakly grammaticalised
As far as unembedded questions are concerned, direction questions are not sharply
distinguished in grammatical form from information questions. Matters are complicated
by the fact that a response giving an answer to a question may, like utterances generally,
have more than one illocutionary force. Consider, for example:
[27] i a. Do you promise not to tell him?
ii a. Would you advise me to accept?
iii a. Have I got to eat it all?
iv a. %Shall I tell the police?b. I promise not to tell him.
b. I would advise you to accept.
b. You have got to eat it all.
b. You shall tell the police.","[896, 897]"
"The answers to the alternative question are I have moved and I am about to move, and those
to the polar question are Yes, I have moved or I am about to move (unlikely as a response: you
would generally give more specific information) and No, I have not moved nor am I about to
move. The example is taken from a bank statement, where the continuation – If so, please call
us on the number below – makes clear that the polar interpretation is intended, but it is equally
easy to imagine contexts where the alternative one applies. Again, the ambiguity would be
resolved in speech by the intonation.",[890]
"Instead of saying I have seen it in answer to [ia], I might say Yes or I have or Yes, I have
or Yes, I’ve seen it, and so on. Although these are different in form they are equivalent,865866Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary forceand we will regard them as (expressing) the same answer. Similarly for the negatives:
I have not seen it; I have not; I haven’t; No; No, I haven’t. These all count as the same
answer. It is in this sense of the term that we can say that [ia] defines a closed set of
just two possible answers. Questions like [iia], on the other hand, define in principle an
open set of answers: there are indefinitely many others besides those given in [iib]. It
was this distinction that provided the basis for general definitions of closed and open
interrogatives.
 The distinction between answer and responseAnswer is to be distinguished from response, which is a purely pragmatic concept. If
you ask question [1ia], Have you seen it?, I could give any of the following as response,
or of course indefinitely many others:
[2]i No. I have.
ii I’m not sure. I can’t remember. Possibly. Does it matter?
iii I’ve already told you that I have. It’s on your desk. I saw it yesterday.","[885, 886]"
"The responses in [i] are answers, but the others are not. In [ii] I avoid giving an answer –
whether on the grounds of insufficient knowledge or for some other reason. The responses in [iii] implicate or entail the answer Yes, but they are not logically equivalent to
Yes: they are not themselves answers. With It’s on your desk I interpret your question as
indirectly asking “Where is it?”, and answer that – Have you seen my pen?, for example,
is a conventional way of indirectly conveying “Where’s my pen?” The final response in
[iii], I saw it yesterday, is not an answer because it contains extra information not called
for in the question.
It is clear, then, that for a wide range of reasons one very often responds to a question
in some other way than by giving an answer. And such a response will sometimes contain
less information than an answer would, and sometimes more.
 ‘The answer’ and ‘the right answer’A semantic question defines a set of answers, but commonly one speaks of the answer
to a question. Unless there are special features of the context indicating otherwise, the
expression the answer is understood to mean “the right answer”. Usually the right answer
is the one that is true, but we will see below (§4.6) that there is a kind of question where
‘right’ cannot have this interpretation.
 Pragmatic questionsInquiry
The pragmatic concept of question is an illocutionary category. Prototypically, a question in this sense is an inquiry. To make a (genuine) inquiry is to ask a question to
which one does not know the answer with the aim of obtaining the answer from the
addressee. An inquiry can be thought of as effectively a kind of a directive – a directive (usually a request) to the addressee to supply the answer. The directive force is
indirect, however, since the propositional content of the implied directive (“Tell me
the answer to the question . . .”) is not the same as that which is actually expressed. As
with the indirect directives discussed in §3.2, the request force can be signalled explicitly in the non-propositional component by the marker please, as in What time is it,
please?",[886]
"§ 6.3 Q–A presuppositions of variable questions6.3 Q–A presuppositions of variable questions
The presuppositions of variable questions cannot be derived in quite so simple a way as
with alternative and polar questions. This is because the set of answers is prototypically
open-ended: we shall not therefore derive the presupposition by taking the disjunction
of the possible answers. Instead we derive it by substituting an appropriate indefinite
phrase for the variable in the open proposition expressed in the question:
[6]i Who wrote the editorial?
ii “Person x wrote the editorial”
iii “Someone wrote the editorial”[variable question]
[open proposition]
[presupposition]We have seen that the answers to a variable question assign values to the variable(s) in the
open proposition. To presuppose that [6i] has a right answer, therefore, is to presuppose
that there is a true proposition in which a value is assigned to the variable in [ii] – and
to presuppose this is to presuppose [iii]. Note that the latter does not constitute an
answer to the question, and to give it as a response would be clearly unco-operative.
This is precisely because it does not provide any information beyond that which the
speaker presents as already established. Thus [iii] no more constitutes an answer to [i]
in set [6] than it does in sets [2–4]. With alternative and polar questions an answer
must be more specific than the presupposition by selecting one of the coordinates;
with variable questions it must be more specific by genuinely providing a value for the
variable.
It will be noted that in [6ii] the variable x is attached to ‘person’ instead of standing
on its own, as in the formulations which, for simplicity of presentation, we have been
using hitherto. ‘Person’ is needed to show that the variable ranges only over the set of
persons: #The lawnmower wrote the editorial, for example, is not a possible answer to
[6i]. ‘Person’, of course, is part of the meaning of who, and is encapsulated also in that
of someone, which appears in the presupposition. For when, a comparable schema is
given in:
[7]i When did they move to Edinburgh?
ii “They moved to Edinburgh at time x”
iii “They moved to Edinburgh at some time”[variable question]
[open proposition]
[presupposition]A detailed account of the presuppositions of variable questions must therefore draw on
a description of the individual interrogative words: we take this up in §7 below.
 Q–A presuppositions in relation to the set consisting of all the answersAnother, but equivalent, approach to an explanation of the Q–A presupposition of a
variable question is to see it as following from every one of the answers. Thus instead of
[6], for example, we might have:
[8]i Who wrote the editorial?
ii “Ian wrote the editorial”; “I wrote the editorial”;
“One of the directors wrote the editorial”; . . .
iii “Someone wrote the editorial”[variable question][answers]
[presupposition]If Ian wrote the editorial, it follows that someone wrote it, and similarly for all other
answers.","[918, 919]"
"Direction questions are also known as ‘deliberative questions’.[direction or information question]877Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force878As a direction question, this is concerned with the choice between future actions by
the speaker: I’m asking you to tell me to retrieve it or not to do so. As an information
question, it is concerned with predictions as to what will happen: will the money be
returned or not?10
The case with should is less clear-cut. Should I get my money back? is ambiguous between a
deontic reading (“Is getting my money back the right thing for me to do?”) and an epistemic
one (“Is it probable that I’ll get it back?”). But the ambiguity is also found in You should get
your money back. So the development of should has certainly not been entirely parallel to
that of shall. Nevertheless, we do see something partly analogous. While Yes, you should is a
perfectly natural (deontic) response to Should I tell the police?, it would be odd to respond in
this way to Should I open the window?, said in a context where it is a matter of my possibly
opening the window there and then. In this use should behaves like shall – and could not be
replaced by ought . . .to, as it could in Should I tell the police?
 Embedded direction questions have infinitival formWe have seen that with unembedded questions the distinction between direction and
information questions is not matched by any sharp grammatical distinction; with embedded ones, however, the distinction is clearly marked. For here there is a construction,
the infinitival interrogative, that is used exclusively for direction questions. Compare the
following, as used, say, in the frame I asked :
[29]information question
i a. whether she told him
ii a. whether he left then or later
iii a. how she got homedirection question
b. whether to tell him
[polar]
b. whether to leave then or later [alternative]
b. how to get home
[variable]Because they are embedded, these are questions only in the semantic sense, not in
the pragmatic sense, as they do not themselves have illocutionary force. But we can
relate them to unembedded questions by considering them in the suggested frame. I
asked whether she told him reports my asking the information question “Did she tell
him?”, while I asked whether to tell him reports my asking the direction question “Shall
I tell him?”11 Note that subordinate interrogatives with shall do not express direction
questions. I must ask him whether I shall get my money back, for example, lacks the
ambiguity of [28], having only the information question interpretation.
 Right answers to direction questionsIt is because of the existence of direction questions that we cannot identify a ‘right’
answer with a true one (cf. §4.1). Right answers to information questions are true, but
the categories true and false are not applicable to directives, and hence to the answers to
direction questions.
10In neither interpretation is You shall get your money back an answer; with a 2nd or 3rd person subject shall
indicates commitment on the part of the speaker, rather than obligation on the part of the subject-referent
(cf. Ch. 3, §9.6.1). The positive answers to the two readings of [28] are therefore Get your money back and You
will get your money back.
11
We are concerned here with indirect reported speech, where one reports the content of what was said rather
than the actual words, but for present purposes we can consider the idealised case where there is the closest
possible match. The embedded infinitival construction does not always correspond to an unembedded shall
question. How shall I turn the machine on? is hardly idiomatic whereas I don’t know how to turn the machine
on is; nevertheless, the answers to the infinitival question involve directions for turning the machine on.","[897, 898]"
"6.2 Q–A presuppositions of polar questions
The presuppositions of polar questions are arrived at in a similar way:
[3]i Has the clock stopped?
ii “The clock has stopped”; “The clock hasn’t stopped”
iii “(Either) the clock has stopped or it hasn’t”[polar question]
[answers]
[presupposition]To presuppose that [i] has a true answer is again to presuppose the disjunction of the
answers listed in [ii], i.e. to presuppose [iii]. The Q–A presupposition of a polar question
is therefore the disjunction of the corresponding statement and its polar opposite.
This applies equally when the question is negative:
[4]i Didn’t she see them?
ii “She didn’t see them”; “She did see them”
iii “(Either) she didn’t see them or she did”[polar question]
[answers]
[presupposition]We have seen that negative questions are biased, but bias is perfectly consistent with
presupposition. The presupposition is that one of the answers is true; the bias goes
beyond this and favours one rather than the other as the true one.
The presuppositions in [3] and [4] are necessarily true: they are logical truths, tautologies. This will always be the case with polar questions: the disjunction of any proposition
and its polar opposite is necessarily true. Polar questions clearly differ in this respect
from alternative ones: [1], for example, is obviously not a logical truth. It should not
be thought, however, that this property of polar presuppositions makes them vacuous:
from a pragmatic point of view they can be of considerable significance. This may be
illustrated by such an example as:
[5]i Are you telling the truth?
ii “(Either) you are telling the truth or you are not”[polar question]
[presupposition]The presupposition is what I take for granted, and the significance here is that the
presupposition is so weak – it doesn’t go beyond a mere tautology. In asking [5i] I take
for granted the truth of [ii], but in so doing conspicuously fail to take for granted the
truth of the proposition “You are telling the truth”. The question entertains the possibility
that you are not telling the truth, thereby casting doubt on your veracity. At the direct
level [i] is clearly a question, not an accusation, but is not uncommon for such questions
to be interpreted as indirect accusations.",[918]
"Closed interrogatives characteristically express questions that can be distinguished
as polar or alternative on the basis of how they define the set of answers (cf. Ch. 10,
§§4.3–5). Compare the main clauses:
[75] i Can we afford it?
ii Can we afford it or not?
iii Will he be found guilty or innocent?[polar][alternative]The answers to a polar question consist of the proposition expressed in the question
itself together with its polar opposite. The answers to the question in [i], for example,
are “We can afford it” and “We can’t afford it”. The answers to an alternative question are
all expressed in the question itself: it contains an or-coordination where each coordinate
represents one answer. In the case of [iii], for example, the answers are “He will be found
guilty” and “He will be found innocent”. Example [ii] belongs with [iii] rather than [i]
in that the answers are given by the coordinates linked by or, just as they are in [iii].",[782]
"1297Chapter 15 Coordination and supplementation1298 Or in questionsOne special case where or-coordination is interpreted exclusively is the alternative question (Ch. 10, §4.4). In this type of question (which has an intonational rise on the initial
coordinate, and fall on the final one) or is essential, whereas when it appears in other
types of question it is merely incidental:
[20]without OR
with OR
i a. [not possible: or essential] b. Would you like tea  or coffee ?
ii a. Would you like a drink ? b. Would you like tea or coffee ?
iii a. Who would like a drink?
b. Who would like tea or coffee?[alternative]
[polar]
[variable]In [ib] or does not appear in the answers, which are simply “I would like tea” and “I
would like coffee” – they are presented as alternative answers, such that one and only one
of them is true. “Both” is not a possible answer in that it rejects this presupposition of
mutual exclusiveness. In [iib] and [iiib], or is retained in the answers: e.g. “Yes, I would
like tea or coffee” and “No, I would not like tea or coffee” for [iib].182.2.2 And and or in combination with negation
When a subclausal or-coordination falls within the scope of a negative, it is equivalent
to an and-coordination of negative clauses:
[21] i I didn’t like his mother or his father.
ii I didn’t like his mother and I didn’t
like his father.[“not A-or-B” = “not-A and not-B”]Similarly He can’t read or write means “He can’t read and he can’t write”, No one
had seen Kim or Pat means “No one had seen Kim and no one had seen Pat”, and
so on.
Conversely, when a subclausal and-coordination falls within the scope of a negative
it is equivalent to an or-coordination of negative clauses:
[22] i He isn’t both treasurer and secretary.
ii He isn’t treasurer or he isn’t secretary.","[1317, 1318]"
"§ 9.11 Lexical modals, have (got), and quasi-modal be(b) Exceptions involving specific constructions
Negative interrogatives, used as questions biased towards a positive answer, have external
negation irrespective of the strength of the modality: Mustn’t it be wonderful to have so
many admirers? (“Is it not the case that it must be wonderful?”, not “Is it the case that it
must not be wonderful?”), Shouldn’t you tell them we’ll be late? A special case of this is in
tags: We must stop soon, mustn’t we?
 InterrogativesThe use of modal auxiliaries in interrogatives is in general predictable from their use
in declaratives: only a few further points need be made, several of which relate to the
common use of modalised questions as indirect speech acts (Ch. 10, §9.6.1). For shall,
see §9.6.
Must and need
In declaratives these differ essentially as semantically positive (must) vs negative (needn’t),
but in interrogatives both can appear in the positive: Must/Need we stay to the end? For
either version the positive answer is Yes we must and the negative is No we needn’t.
However, a lexical modal is more likely in such questions: Do we have to stay to the end?
Must readily occurs in such indirect speech acts as MUST you interrupt when I’m speaking?
This conveys that there is no necessity and that therefore you shouldn’t interrupt.
Can, may, and will
For epistemic possibility can is much preferred over may, and in either case the tentative
preterite forms could and might are more likely: Could/Might it be a forgery? Questions about deontic possibility are commonly used as indirect requests, for permission
(May/Can I go with him?) or other things (May/Can I have some sugar?). Tentative could
and might express diffidence, and would not appear in the answer (A: Could/Might
I have a try? – B: Yes you can/may). Dynamic can (ability) and will (volition) similarly appear frequently in indirect requests, prototypically with a 2nd person subject:
Can/Could/Will/Would you help me.
Should
This generally has a deontic interpretation in interrogatives: Should he go by bus? Because should takes internal negation, the modality is effectively outside the scope of the
question, which presupposes that he should do one of two things, go by bus or not go
by bus. There is a special epistemic use in open interrogatives, normally with why, as in
Why should he have resigned? This is ambiguous between a deontic reading “Why was
the right thing for him to do to resign?” and an epistemic one not predictable from the
use of should in declaratives, “Why do you assume/think he resigned?”","[224, 225]"
"The propositional content of B’s echo question is clearly not “He’s going to resign”, but
“You said he’s going to resign”, and a Yes answer in this context is equivalent to I asked
whether he is going to resign, not to He’s going to resign. The latter would be an answer to
A’s question, not B’s – to an ordinary question, not an echo question. The same applies
to the other kinds of question. For example, the propositional content of B’s variable
question in [51iii] is approximately “You said that he’s going to x”.
This indirectness is a crucial property distinguishing echo questions from ordinary questions.
They are not distinguished simply by the fact that an echo question questions what has just
been said, for it is perfectly possible to use an ordinary question to do that:
[54]previous utterance
i A: She’s leaving on Saturday.
ii A: He’s proposing to resign.ordinary question
B: Did you say she’s leaving on Saturday?
B: What did you say he’s proposing to do?",[907]
"3.5 Coordination of clause types
 Coordination of unlike typesCoordinated clauses are usually of the same type, but do not have to be: this is one
reason why we take declarative, imperative, etc., to be categories of the clause rather
than the sentence. Coordination of unlike types is seen in [26i] (main clauses) and [26ii]
(subordinate clauses):
[26] i a. [It’ll be very hot,][so take plenty of drink].
[declar + impve]
b. [They’ve finished the job,] [but why did they take so long?] [declar + interrog]
c. [Did you make your own contributions to a complying
superannuation fund] [and your assessable income is
less than $31,000?]
[interrog + declar]
d.[You give the first three lectures][and then I’ll take over].
[impve + declar]
e. [Come around six,][or is that too early?]
[impve + interrog]
f. [What a disaster it was][and yet no-one seemed to mind ]. [exclam + declar]
ii a. I knew [that he would come][and what he would say].
[declar + interrog]
b. I remember [who was there][and what a success it was]. [interrog + exclam]
With main clauses such mixed coordinations characteristically involve a sequence of
separate speech acts (statements, questions, directives, etc.), so that the coordinator will§ 3.5 Coordination of clause typeshave wider scope than the illocutionary components. A normal utterance of [ia], for
example, consists of a statement (or prediction) followed by a directive. Similarly, in [ib]
we have a statement followed by a question, in [if] an exclamatory statement followed
by an ordinary statement.
But this is not so in all cases. Most obviously, [26ic] (taken from an income tax form)
expresses a single question, not question + statement: this is a rather unusual case where
in a coordination of full main clauses a feature of the first coordinate (here the closed
interrogative clause type) has semantic scope over the whole coordination.53 A different
case again is seen in [ie]. It is not a matter of a choice between a directive and a question:
the question has priority, and only if the answer is negative does the directive stand
(“Come around six if that is not too early”).
 Coordinations of like typeAn unmixed coordination of main declaratives (Kim is in Bonn and Pat is too) can
generally be taken as a single statement of a composite proposition, though (at least
with and ) it would make no effective difference if we regarded it as a combination of
statements, each of a simple proposition. Analogously for imperatives.
The situation with interrogatives is more complex. And, as in Who is it and what
do they want?, can be taken to join questions, though again this hardly differs from
an interpretation as a single composite question (with answers like “It’s Jill and she
wants to borrow the saw”). But does not normally coordinate main interrogatives (we
would not say Who is it but what do they want?).54 With or we have several distinct
possibilities:
[27] i Is it genuine or is it a hoax?
ii Have you moved or are you about to move?
iii Either can you eat it or have I got one?[alternative Q]
[alternative or polar Q]
[two polar questions]Example [i] is a single question, with or marking it as of the alternative kind: the answers
are “It is genuine” and “It is a hoax”. Example [ii], discussed in Ch. 10, §4.4, could
also be an alternative question, asking whether your move has already taken place or is
imminent. But it can also be a single polar question, asked for example in order to find
out whether the writer’s record of your address needs changing: here the answers are
“Yes, I have moved or am about to move” and “No, I have not moved nor am I about
to move”. This is comparable to [26ic], for in both of them the whole coordination
expresses a single polar question, but whereas with and the second clause is declarative,
with or it has to be interrogative. Example [27iii] is a coordination of questions: much
less usual, but possible in a context where, for example, I am trying to solve a puzzle and
say, Give me a clue by answering one of the following questions: Either can . . . The either
in [iii] makes explicit that the coordination has wide scope, i.e that it is a coordination
of questions. It could not appear at the beginning of [i–ii], where the coordination
has narrow scope (coordination within a question). This scope factor accounts for the
53The same applies in informal speech in examples like Did he come in and I was still asleep? (=[30ii] of §2),
or How could you have been so spiteful, and her your best friend? (where the second clause is verbless, and is
interpreted as “given that she was your best friend”). A further case where an element in the first coordinate
may have scope over the second is seen in It might be up there and I can’t see it : here might has wide scope, the
meaning being “it might be that it is up there and I can’t see it”.
54
Exceptions arise when one of the interrogatives is used as an indirect statement: Isn’t it a bargain, but where
could we put it?","[1352, 1353]"
"B’s When? in [i] asks for a more specific directive, whereas Why? asks for a reason for
complying with the directive. Features such as time and place count as features of the
action itself (getting your money back tomorrow is a different action from getting it
back next week), but reason does not (getting your money back counts as the same
action, whether you do it for this reason or for that). Similarly in [ii] When? asks for
further specification of the propositional content of A’s question: it is a clarificatory echo
question, elliptical for Did I see her when? (cf. §4.8.4). Why?, by contrast, asks for A’s
reason for asking the question – and could accompany an answer to the question, as in
Yes, why?",[927]
"Dimension [i] is based on the way the question defines the set of answers. Polar and
alternative make up the class we have called closed question, and both are characteristically expressed by closed interrogatives. Variable questions are open questions, and are
expressed by open interrogatives. We examine polar, alternative, and variable questions
in turn in the next three sections.
For the other three dimensions the category in the left column of [4] can be regarded
as the default, and §§4.6–8 will therefore focus respectively on direction questions (where
the answers have the force of directives, not statements), biased questions (where the
speaker is biased in favour of one answer over another) and echo questions (which seek
repetition or clarification of what has just been said).",[887]

 The five major categoriesClause type is the grammatical system whose five major terms are illustrated in:

ii Are you generous?
iii How generous are you?
iv How generous you are!
v Be generous.[declarative]
[closed interrogative]
[open interrogative]
[exclamative]
[imperative] Characteristic use and general definitionsEach of the categories is associated with a characteristic use as follows:
[2]clause type
i declarative
ii closed interrogative
iii open interrogative
iv exclamative
v imperativecharacteristic use
statement
closed question
open question
exclamatory statement
directiveA closed question is one with a closed set of answers: for example, the answers to [1ii] are
just “Yes” and “No”. By contrast, [1iii] has any number of possible answers, and is therefore
an open question; similarly with Who attended the meeting?, and so on. In [2iv] we have
used ‘exclamatory statement’ rather than the more familiar ‘exclamation’, because an
exclamatory meaning can be added to any of the use categories, but the special syntactic
construction shown in [1iv] is associated just with a particular kind of statement. For
example, the exclamatory command Get the hell out of here or the exclamatory question
What on earth are you doing? belong syntactically with [1v] and [1iii] respectively, not
with [1iv]. ‘Directive’ in [2v] is a cover term for requests, commands, instructions, and
the like; traditional grammars tend to use the term ‘command’, but this is far too narrow
and specific for our purposes if understood in its everyday sense.
The correlation shown in [2] provides the basis for general definitions of the clause
type categories:
[3]Imperative clause is a grammatically distinct class of clause whose members are
characteristically used to issue directives.","[869, 870, 871, 872, 873]"
"The expected answer is here the statement with the same propositional content as
the question – i.e. They’ve finished and They haven’t finished respectively. In asking a881882Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary forcedeclarative question I am typically seeking confirmation of a proposition that I am inclined, with varying degrees of strength, to believe. There may be deontic or desiderative
bias as well as epistemic, but this is not inherent to the construction as such.
 Lexical reinforcement of biasThe bias may be reinforced by lexical markers indicating confidence in the truth of the
proposition expressed:
[39] i They no doubt misunderstood her intentions?
ii You’re surely not going to agree?
iii And the manager has been informed, of course?
iv There isn’t any chance of her changing her mind, I take it?
These confidence markers are outside the propositional content of the question, outside
the scope of the question. The positive answer to [39i], for example, is not They no
doubt misunderstood her intentions, but simply They misunderstood her intentions. Such
markers would not naturally occur in interrogative questions, where comparable items
are epistemically much weaker:
[40] i Did they perhaps misunderstand her intentions?
ii Isn’t there any chance of her changing her mind, I wonder?
 Responses to declarative questionsThe bias of declarative questions is reflected in the fact that they can naturally receive
confirmatory responses like That’s right, Exactly, Quite so, which would be out of place
with a neutral question. Yes can even occur here with a following negative, which is not
normally possible: Yes, there’s no chance at all is a plausible response to [39iv], but not to
interrogative Is there any chance of her changing her mind? or even Isn’t there any chance
of her changing her mind?
 Declarative questions as indirect speech actsThe illocutionary force of declarative questions is not that characteristically associated with
the clause type, and hence they are indirect speech acts in the sense of §3.2. At the direct
level they are statements, but the intonation overrides this to yield an indirect question. The
indirectness is reflected in the fact that pragmatic inferences may be involved in determining
the scope of the question, which need not be the whole of the propositional content. Consider,
for example:
[41] i I take it there isn’t any chance of her changing her mind?
ii I hope you’re not proposing to leave it like that?
iii I don’t suppose I could borrow your car for a couple of hours?
Example [41i] differs grammatically and semantically from [39iv], but pragmatically there
is little difference. In [39iv] I take it is a parenthetical (§5.3), but in [41i] it occurs as part
of a complex clause construction: there isn’t any chance of her changing her mind is this time
a subordinate clause, the grammatical complement of take, and its content is semantically
integrated into that of the complex clause. Nevertheless, I take it is again outside the scope of
the question: the expected answer is not You take it there isn’t any chance . . . , but simply There
isn’t any chance . . . At the direct level, [41i] is a statement with the propositional content “I
take it there isn’t any chance of her changing her mind”, but indirectly it is a question
with the content “There isn’t any chance of her changing her mind”, or perhaps “It is true§ 4.7.3 Negative interrogative questionsthat there isn’t any chance of her changing her mind”. Example [ii] is just like [i], but [iii]
involves two additional factors. One is that the negative is associated with the complement of
suppose (cf. the discussion of increased specificity of negation in Ch. 9, §5), giving “Couldn’t
I borrow your car for a couple of hours?”; and the other factor is that the latter question in
turn indirectly conveys a request to borrow the car.","[901, 902, 903]"
"4.8.3 The form of polar echo questions
Unlike the variable echo question, the polar echo is not, for the most part, expressed by
any special grammatical construction: rather, the echo is signalled prosodically, by the889890Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary forcerising intonation. A polar echo question can have the syntactic form belonging to any
of the clause types. Polar counterparts of the variable echoes given in [58], for example,
are as follows:
[60]
stimulus
polar echo question
i A: She’s a genius.
B: She’s a genius?
[declarative]
ii A: Did Kim complain?
B: Did Kim complain?
[closed interrogative]
iii A: What did he tell her?
B: What did he tell her?
[open interrogative]
iv A: What a fuss Ed made!
B: What a fuss Ed made?
[exclamative]
v A: Give the key to Angela.
B: Give the key to Angela?
[imperative]
The echo repeats the stimulus, with rising intonation signalling a request for repetition,
or justification.
We have seen that rising intonation can also combine with declarative clause type to yield an
ordinary polar (or alternative) question, and there is accordingly again potential ambiguity
in examples like She’s a genius? It can be an ordinary (direct) question whose answers are
She’s a genius and She’s not a genius; or it can be, as in [60i], a polar echo (indirect) question
whose answers are I said she’s a genius and I didn’t say she’s a genius. In both cases the question
is biased – towards an answer which expresses the same propositional content as is expressed
in the direct question or implied in the indirect one. For example, in:
[61]a. She gave it to him?b. She didn’t give it to him?the expected answers for the ordinary question interpretations are, for [a], She gave it to him
and, for [b], She didn’t give it to him, whereas those for the echo question interpretations are
respectively I said, ‘She gave it to him’ and I said, ‘She didn’t give it to him’.

"6 The presuppositions of information questions
 Pragmatic Q–A presuppositionsIn general, when I ask a question I presuppose that it has a right answer. We are concerned
here with pragmatic presupposition: to presuppose something in this sense is to take
it for granted, as not at issue, to present it as uncontroversial background. In the case of
information questions, to presuppose that a question has a right answer is to presuppose
that one of the possible answers is true.
There are several different kinds of pragmatic presupposition, and we will accordingly
refer more specifically to the kind we are concerned with here as a question–answer
presupposition (‘Q–A presupposition’). The most straightforward case is perhaps that
of the alternative question: we will look at this first, and then examine how the concept
of Q–A presupposition applies to polar and variable questions.",[917]
"4.7 Biased questions
 The distinction between neutral questions and biased questionsA biased question is one where the speaker is predisposed to accept one particular answer as the right one. A neutral question lacks such bias towards one answer rather
than another: it is the default category on this dimension. The distinction between
neutral and biased questions applies primarily to polar questions. Compare, for
example:
[32] i Did you get any annuity, superannuation, or other pension?
ii Doesn’t she like it?[neutral]
[biased]Example [i] is taken from an income tax form: it is addressed individually to all those
filling in the form, and for any individual there is no expectation on the part of the
‘speaker’ (the Income Tax Commissioner) that the answer will be positive rather than
negative, or vice versa. A plausible context for [ii], though not the only one, is that her
behaviour or her remarks suggest that she doesn’t like it: I ask the question to confirm
whether this is so. In such a context the question is biased towards the negative answer
She doesn’t like it.12
12Alternative terms for ‘neutral’ and ‘biased’ are ‘open’ and ‘conducive’ respectively.",[899]
"§ 4.8.1 The contrast between echo and ordinary questions4.8.1 The contrast between echo and ordinary questions
 Echo questions as indirect speech actsThe propositional content of echo questions is not the same as that which is actually
expressed in the utterance, and such questions therefore belong to the class of indirect
speech acts. The propositional content of the echo question in [51i] is not “She’s leaving
on Saturday”, the content actually expressed, but something like “You said she’s leaving
on Saturday”. (We say ‘something like’ for it could be “You’re telling me . . .”, “You’re
suggesting . . .”, and so on: precisely because it is implicit rather than directly expressed
there is some imprecision as to what it is.) And, correspondingly, the answer Yes is
equivalent not to She’s leaving on Saturday, but to I said she’s leaving on Saturday. The
difference between these two interpretations may not seem very important, but is of
much greater significance in a case like:
[53]A: Is he going to resign?","[906, 907]"
"For convenience, we give the answers in unreduced form, rather than as Yes, I do, etc.
Answer [ib] has the illocutionary verb promise used performatively, so that it is a promise
as well as a statement. Similarly [iib] both makes a statement and gives advice: it differs
from [ib] in that the advice force is indirect rather than direct, because we have I would
advise, not I advise. Answer [iiib] is literally a statement but, in the context of answering
question [iiia], stating that you have to eat it all amounts to telling you to do so. Here
then we have an answer which is both statement and directive. However, from the point
of view of its form, and more specifically of the relation between its form and that of its
answer, there is nothing special about [iiia]. What makes [iva] different from the other
questions is that shall here has a sense that is specialised to direction questions: [ivb] is
not a possible answer precisely because the meaning of shall is not the same.
The semantic development of shall has led to a situation where it has a use in 1st
person interrogatives that specifically marks direction questions. It can also be used with
a futurity sense, as in the information question Shall I ever need it again? As a result,
there is potential for ambiguity:
[28]
9Shall I get my money back?",[897]
"§ 9.6.2 Non-deontic uses and shall vs will(c) Shall in direction questions
Example [42iii] is what we call a direction question (Ch. 10, §4.6): I’m asking you to
tell me whether to close the window or not. The prototypical answer is an imperative
(e.g. Yes, please do), not a declarative with shall. This use occurs mainly with 1st person
subjects, and for many varieties will would be quite impossible here with this meaning.","[214, 215]"
"A likely context for this (not the only possible one of course) is where I don’t know
the time, want to know the time, and believe you may well be able to tell me. In this861Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force862context it would indirectly convey “What time is it?” This is why it would be thoroughly
unco-operative in such a context for you to respond merely with Yes. Yes would answer
the question that is actually asked, but not the one that I in fact want to have answered.
Another plausible context for [7] is where it is addressed to a child (by a parent, say)
when it is known to be past the child’s bedtime: here my intention may well be to convey
a directive to go to bed.
In either contextualisation, I perform two illocutionary acts simultaneously, one
directly (a question as to whether you know what time it is), and one indirectly (a
question as to what time it is, or a directive to go to bed). We will follow the established
practice of referring to indirect illocutionary acts as indirect speech acts (with the
understanding that the term covers writing as well as speech). Commonly, the direct act
is obviously less important than the indirect one – as when the interest of the question
whether you know the time is simply that if you do you will be able to answer the question
that I really do want an answer to. There is an analogy here with performatives, and we
will again, where appropriate, apply the terms ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ to the different
acts or forces. Thus just as in the performative I promise to return the key tomorrow the
promise is primary and the statement secondary, so in the first contextualisation of [7]
the question about the time is primary and that about your knowledge secondary. The
difference is that in the performative case the primary act is direct, whereas in such cases
as [7] it is not.
 Definition of indirect speech actAn indirect speech act is one where (a) the propositional content actually expressed
differs from that which the speaker intends to convey with some illocutionary force, or
(b) where the illocutionary force is different from that normally conveyed by the clause
type concerned.
Most cases are covered by condition (a). The propositional content expressed in [7],
for example, is “You know what time it is”, whereas the propositional content that I
intend to convey is “What time is it?” (with question force) or “You go to bed” (with
directive force). Case (b) is illustrated by [4iii] of §1, Sleep well. At the direct level it is a
directive (the force characteristically associated with imperative clause type), but since
sleeping well is not something that we normally regard as being under our control it will
generally have the indirect force of a wish.4
 Degrees of indirectnessThere are varying degrees of indirectness, depending on how different the two propositional contents are. The first suggested contextualisation of [7], for example, is less
indirect than the second because the propositional content of the conveyed “What time
4The sense of ‘indirect’ introduced in this section is quite different from the one it has in traditional grammar
in such expressions as ‘indirect question.’ A traditional indirect question, such as the underlined clause in
She asked who had done it, is in our terminology a subordinate interrogative, whereas an indirect question in
the speech-act sense might be I’d be interested to hear your view, when used to convey “What is your view?”
As it happens, both senses are applicable in [7], but to different parts of it. The subordinate clause what
time it is is an indirect question in the traditional sense (it is a subordinate interrogative clause), whereas the
whole utterance is an indirect question in the speech act sense (in the use where it conveys “What time is it?”).
We will use ‘indirect’ solely in the speech-act sense.","[881, 882]"
"1215Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clauses1216one verb at a time. Compare:
[26] i She can’t always answer his questions, can she?
[negation of can]
ii She can always not answer his questions, can’t she?
[negation of answer]
iii She can’t always not answer his questions, can she?
[negation of both verbs]
There is an equivalence between [i] and It isn’t always possible for her to answer his questions,
is it? : the negation clearly includes the can/possible within its scope semantically, and the
interrogative tag shows that it does so syntactically too – the standard type of tag reverses
the polarity of the clause to which it attaches (cf. Ch. 9, §1.1).
By contrast, [26ii] is equivalent to It is always possible for her not to answer his questions, isn’t it? (“to refrain from answering”), where the can/possible is now outside the
scope of the negative, hence positive, as reflected in the negative tag. And [iii] is equivalent to It is not possible for her to always not answer his questions, is it? The two negatives here do not of course cancel each other out because they are negating different
verbs; the tag is the same as in [i], because it is determined by the polarity of the can
clause.
The always in these examples makes it easy to see the scope of the negatives. If we omit
it, there is no longer anything in the linear sequence of elements alone to determine the
scope: She + can + not + answer his questions could in principle have either the first or
second interpretation. The second requires a special prosodic reading in which there is a
break after can and the not is closely linked to answer ; in writing cannot would force the
first interpretation, whereas can not would tend to be used for the second. An inflectional
negative always indicates that the negative has syntactic scope over that verb: She can’t answer
his questions unambiguously has the first interpretation.
The same range of possibilities is even available with perfect have:
[27] i He has not always accepted bribes, has he?
ii He has always not accepted bribes, hasn’t he?
iii He has not always not accepted bribes, has he?[negation of have]
[negation of accept]
[negation of both verbs]Have is negated in [i] and [iii], where has not is replaceable by inflectional hasn’t, but in
[ii] the have clause is positive (as evident from the tag), and the not belongs syntactically as
well as semantically with accept : “It has always been his practice to not accept (i.e. to refuse)
bribes”.
Examples like [26ii/27ii] are just like the earlier [16iib] (She asked not to be included in
the survey), and the catenative analysis enables them to be handled in just the same way, as
non-finite complement negation, secondary negation in the sense of Ch. 9, §2.3. This is not
possible in the dependent-auxiliary analysis, where they have to be treated as exceptions. The
above contrasts show that the proposed VGp does not in fact form a unit with a single syntactic
negation. It is true that examples like [i] represent the normal pattern, but the catenative
analysis caters more satisfactorily for the range of options that the verbal system makes
available.29 (It should also be borne in mind that in the ordinary catenative construction
negation of the matrix is much more frequent than negation of the complement.) Other
29Attested examples of the construction shown in [iii] are rare, but the following is a slightly more complex
version of it: Not since 1992 had Sampras not taken at least one among the Australian Open, French Open,
Wimbledon and the US Open. The initial negative phrase negates the have clause, while the second not negates
the take clause.","[1235, 1236]"
"1535Chapter 17 Deixis and anaphora1536(a) Pro-clause complement with finite antecedent: I think so
[58] i A: Are they putting the price up? B: I think so. / I’m afraid so. / It seems so.
ii She thought he was wrong but was too polite to say so.
iii She was totally opposed to the idea and told the premier so.
iv Will she accept the recommendations, and if so how will they affect us?
So here stands for a clause in complement function: we understand “I think they are putting the price up”, and so on. The understood clause is always declarative, though the antecedent can be interrogative, as in [i/iv]. This construction is found with the conditional
preposition if, the adjective afraid, and a fair number of verbs, a sample of which are
given in:
[59]appear
hope
seemassume
imagine
supposebelieve
presume
suspectfear
reckon
tellgather
regret
thinkguess
say
trustAppear and seem take impersonal it as subject: it seems so. Many of the others allow
passivisation, with so then in extraposed subject position: It is believed so, etc. Verbs
which, by contrast, do not allow so to substitute for a clausal complement include confirm,
doubt, realise, resent.48
A number of the verbs in [59] also allow it or that as a pro-clause anaphor. In most
cases there is a fairly clear difference in meaning between so and these NPs. It is particularly clear in 1st person singular present tense examples like I believe so vs I believe it/that.
With I believe so the main issue is the truth of the antecedent proposition: I might well
use this in response to a polar question to give a modally qualified positive answer. With
I believe it/that the main issue is whether I believe the proposition concerned (and this
time the antecedent could hardly be interrogative). The difference emerges very sharply
if we add yes. In Yes, I believe so, the yes relates to the proposition expressed by so; in
Yes, I believe it/that the yes relates to the matrix proposition: “Yes I do believe”. Or take
the verb regret. I regret so is understood as “Yes, regrettably”, while in I regret it/that the
truth of the proposition expressed by the complement is taken for granted, and what is
asserted is that my attitude to it is one of regret.
Polarity: so and not
So normally expresses a positive proposition, with not being used as the corresponding
negative pro-form. In response to Will Kim be there?, for example, I hope so is understood
as “I hope Kim will be there” and I hope not as “I hope Kim will not be there”.49 There
is likewise a straightforward contrast with if between positive so and negative not. With
say and tell, however, so readily substitutes for a negative clause and not is quite rare and
often inadmissible outside responses to questions:
[60] i She didn’t approve of the idea and told them so/∗not.
ii A: Will they be accepting the proposal? B: She says not.
48In general know belongs with these, but there is an established somewhat jocular use of know so when
an explicit contrast is being made between knowing and merely thinking – e.g. A: Do you think so? B: I
KNOW SO.
49
A number of the verbs in [59] occur in the negative with what we have called increased specificity of the
negation (Ch. 9, §5), so that I don’t think so is typically interpreted as equivalent to the less frequent I think
not.","[1555, 1556]"
"§ 14.6.2 The ungoverned constructionThe constraint that excludes [74ib] while allowing [74iib/iiib] can therefore be stated as
follows:
[76] The closed interrogative in the ungoverned construction must correspond to an
alternative question.
The presence of an or-coordination is not itself sufficient. Will one or other of your colleagues be elected?, for example, can only express a polar question: the answers are “Yes,
one or other of them will be elected” and “No, one or other of them won’t be elected”, not
“One of them will be elected” and “∗ Other of them will be elected”. The corresponding
ungoverned exhaustive conditional is therefore excluded: ∗I’ll be happy whether one or
other of your colleagues is elected.
It should also be noted that in the alternative question type, the interrogative subordinator can only be whether, not if. In conditionals, if can only have its primary, conditional
meaning, so that I won’t serve on the committee if you’re on it or if I’d be expected to chair it
does not belong to the exhaustive conditional construction. If is excluded from the governed construction too, but that follows from the general rule that whether is normally
required in closed interrogatives functioning as complement of a preposition.
 The open typeIn the open construction there is a major difference in form between the governed and
ungoverned subordinate clauses: the interrogative word in the latter is compounded
with ·ever. Elsewhere ever is associated with interrogative words only in an emotive sense
(and is usually though not always written as a separate word), but in the exhaustive
conditional it has a ‘free choice’ sense. Compare:
[77] i What ever did she give him?
ii Whatever she gave him, he grumbled.[emotive ever]
[free choice ever]In [i] ever is comparable to on earth and suchlike expressions, whereas in [ii] the meaning
is comparable to that of any in its free choice sense: for any value of x in “she gave him
x”, he grumbled.30 In the governed construction this free choice meaning is expressed by
the governing item, regardless, irrespective, no matter, independently; in the ungoverned
construction it is expressed within the interrogative word. The meaning of [ii] is thus
the same as that of No matter what she gave him, he grumbled.
Relationship with fused relatives
Free choice ·ever, we have noted, does not appear elsewhere in interrogative clauses,
but it is found in fused relatives. In terms of its form the ungoverned open exhaustive
conditional resembles a fused relative, but it differs sharply in its external syntax and
meaning. Compare:
[78] i a. The business will fail whoever takes over as manager.
b. Whoever takes over as manager will have a hard job ahead.
ii a. Whatever she gave him, he grumbled.
b. Whatever she gave him he devoured voraciously.[conditional]
[fused relative]
[conditional]
[fused relative]In [i], the conditional is a clause functioning as adjunct while the fused relative is an NP
functioning as subject. Unlike the conditional, the fused relative here denotes a person: it
30The matrix may restrict the range to which the free choice applies, as in Whatever (else) that bird is, it isn’t a
kookaburra. The implicature here is that I don’t know what the bird is, but I do know it isn’t a kookaburra.","[782, 783]"
"In [i], B’s response gives an answer to A’s question. In [ia–c] it has the form of a phrase
with the same function as the interrogative phrase in the question, so that [ia] is an
elliptical version of She got home yesterday morning, and so on. The question in [id]
concerns the complement of progressive be and the response serves as a replacement
for do + what (cf. §7.6): They were playing cards. In [ii] B gives a negative answer to A’s
polar question, and then asserts a contrasting positive proposition. B’s responses are thus
equivalent to I didn’t read them all: I read only the first three and They weren’t fighting:
they were just shouting at each other.
Radical reduction is also found with contrastive negation, as in:
[80] i A: They’ve invited Jill.
ii A: They were shouting at each other.",[1562]
"6.1 Q–A presuppositions of alternative questions
The possible answers to [1i] are given in [ii], and its Q–A presupposition in [iii]:
[1]i Is he leaving on Monday or Tuesday?
ii “He is leaving on Monday”; “He is leaving on Tuesday”
iii “He is leaving on Monday or Tuesday”[alternative Q]
[answers]
[presupposition]To presuppose that [i] has a right answer is to presuppose the disjunction (or-coordination) of the possible answers, i.e. “Either he is leaving on Monday or he is leaving
on Tuesday”, which is logically equivalent to [iii]. The presupposition of an alternative
question can thus be derived simply by taking the corresponding statement.",[917]
"4.7.3 Negative interrogative questions
Questions with negative interrogative form are always strongly biased. They typically
allow a range of interpretations, and the epistemic bias can be towards either the negative
or the positive answer. Consider:
[42]Didn’t I tell you Kim would be coming?",[903]
"1305Chapter 15 Coordination and supplementation1306 Distributional restrictions on correlative coordinationCorrelative coordination is considerably more restricted in its distribution than the
default non-correlative coordination.
(a) Largely excluded from position following a pre-head dependent
[40] i ∗It had been approved by [the both federal and state governments].
ii ∗Your speech must be [very either witty or brief ].
The inadmissible correlative coordinations (underlined) are here located after the dependent the in NP structure and after the dependent very in AdjP structure. The ungrammaticality can be removed by dropping either the or both from [i], very or either
from [ii].26
(b) Both (unlike either) can’t be used before first coordinate in main
clause coordination
[41] i ∗Both he overslept and his bus was late.
ii Either he overslept or his bus was late.
(c) Both excluded from joint coordination
[42] i Both Kim and Pat are happy.
ii ∗Both Kim and Pat are a happy couple.[distributive]
[joint]Both is also excluded from examples like I want to see Kim and no-one else / Kim and
only Kim, where the second coordinate serves to exclude everyone other than Kim.
(d) Either excluded from alternative questions
[43] i Are they coming on either Monday or Tuesday?
ii ∗Are you either coming or not?
Example [i] can only be a polar question, one with Yes and No as answers, while [ii] is
simply inadmissible.
(e) Generally excluded from coordinations with asymmetric and and or
Both and either tend to emphasise the equality of the coordinates and hence do not in
general combine with the asymmetric uses of and and or described in §§2.2.3–4 above.
As we noted, The coffee is both nice and hot is not possible except as an ordinary
coordination, assigning two separate properties to the coffee, and He has both gone
and told the teacher likewise has only a literal interpretation. In He both got up and
had breakfast and I both fell offthe ladder and broke my leg the both is unexpected, and
calls into question the temporal sequence and consequence implicatures of the versions
without both. Similarly either two or three can’t be used as an approximation like two
or three, but presents two alternatives. There is, however, one asymmetric use of or that
permits either in certain cases – the one where it has a conditional and directive interpretation, as in Either you tidy your room or you lose your pocket money. The either here
reinforces the implicature (“Tidy your room!”) by emphasising that there is no third
alternative.
26Under certain conditions correlative coordination is possible in this position: A similar [both very negative and
very positive] appraisal of the theoretical importance of such research may be found in Jones (1982) ; It was clearly
an [either misinformed or else simply malicious] suggestion.","[1325, 1326]"
"9.6 Non-imperative directives
9.6.1 Interrogatives as directives
Directives are very often conveyed indirectly by means of interrogatives. This is especially so with requests – particularly when speaker and addressee are not intimates. The
imperative structure, we have noted, can be used for a wide range of directives, including
orders: to make a request by means of an imperative may therefore run the risk of appearing too brusque or peremptory, even if illocutionary modifiers like please and kindly
are added. In many circumstances indirect directives with interrogative form are considered more polite. This is not to suggest that there is any simple correlation between
interrogative form and politeness with directives. In the first place, prosody plays an
important and in part independent role: Can you move your car? will typically be more
polite than Move your car, but this can be overridden by an impatient, emphatic tone of
voice. Secondly it depends on the content of the interrogative: Can you move your car
lends itself much more readily to use as a polite request than, say, Must you park your car
across my driveway?
We find a great variety of interrogative directives, but four of the most important
semantic categories concern: (a) your ability to do something; (b) your desire or willingness to do something; (c) the deontic necessity for you to do something; (d) the reason
for you to do something:
[42] i Can you open the door. (“Open the door”)
ii Would you like to / Will you sign here? (“Sign here”)
iii Must you talk so loud? (“Don’t talk so loud”)
iv Why don’t you bring your radio? (“Bring your radio”)[ability]
[desire/willingness]
[deontic necessity]
[reason]939940Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force(As noted in §3.2, there is some variation with respect to punctuation, with a full stop
often preferred to a question mark in the ability or desire/willingness cases.)
(a) Ability questions
These lend themselves to indirect directive use since a likely reason for me to be interested
in your ability to do something is that I want you to do it. Typical openers are:
[43]can you, could you, is it possible ( for you), will/would it be possible (for you), are
you able, will/would you be ableThe versions with can are most frequent, and are especially likely in contexts where the
answer is obviously “yes”, so that the direct inquiry force is effectively lost; this will usually
apply with such everyday examples as Can you pass the salt, etc. The forms with preterites
(could/would, with the preterite indicating tentativeness) are regarded as more polite.
All the above could be negated: can’t you, couldn’t you, etc. Negative questions are
always biased, and in the present case the negation adds some emotive component of
meaning, perhaps impatience (Can’t you talk a little louder?, suggesting you ought to be
able to) or persuasiveness (Couldn’t you stay a little bit longer?). Inflectional negatives
always have the ability predicate within their scope; analytic ones with can are potentially
ambiguous as to scope. Can you not stand by the door, for example, can have the not in
the can clause or in the stand clause. In the first case it is a negative question conveying
the positive directive “Stand by the door”, and in the second it is a positive question
conveying the negative directive “Don’t stand by the door”.
(b) Desire/willingness questions
These likewise have a natural connection with directives: if you want or are willing to do
something you are likely to comply with a request to do it. Typical formulae are:
[44] i will/would you, would you like to / care to / be so kind as to
[+ infinitival]
ii do/would you mind
[+ gerund-participial]
Again the tentative preterite would adds to the effect of politeness. (Note that want occurs
in this use with do but not would, and is appreciably less polite: Do you want to clear
the table so that we can have lunch?) Inflectional negatives are possible for those taking
infinitival complements, especially the first three (won’t/wouldn’t you, wouldn’t you like
to); they do not occur with mind, for the salient bias of the question would be positive,
suggesting that you do/would mind. The analytic negatives will/would you not have the
scope ambiguity illustrated above for can. Compare:
[45] i Will you not [take a seat]?
ii Will you [not put your feet on the sofa].[not in will clause]
[not in put clause]The pragmatically salient interpretations have primary verb negation in [i], “Take a seat”,
and secondary negation in [ii], “Don’t put your feet on the sofa”.
Closely related to desire/willingness is prospective intentional future, as in Are/Aren’t
you going to tidy your room? These express doubt as to whether you intend to do what
you should do, and for this reason are quite well down the politeness scale.
(c) Deontic necessity questions
Deontic necessity is usually questioned by must, as in [42iii] or have (Do you have to talk
so loud?), though need, necessary, etc., are also possible (cf. Need you / Is it necessary to talk
so loud?). The situation denoted in the complement clause (your talking so loud) is one§ 9.6.2 Declaratives as directivesthat I regard as undesirable, and the question has, in context, a clear negative bias: I don’t
think there is any necessity for you to talk so loud. Hence the implied directive – whose
content is this time the opposite of that expressed in the complement clause. Suggesting
that you are unnecessarily doing what I don’t want does not of course make for a polite
directive.
(d) Reason questions
These are usually expressed by means of why and have been discussed in §4.5. Here again
the content of the implicit directive is the opposite of that expressed in the question,
whether the latter is negative, as in [42iv], or positive, as in Why accept less? (“Don’t
accept less”).
 3rd personThe above examples all have you as subject, but just as imperatives can have 3rd person
subjects, so can interrogatives with directive force: Will everyone remember to sign the
register. It is also possible to have 3rd person subjects in examples like those given in [42]:
Can he come a little earlier tonight?; Would he like to return my wrench?; Must they talk
so loud?; Why doesn’t she bring her radio? These aren’t equivalent to imperatives because
they are not addressed to the person(s) concerned, but can still have indirect directive
force, suggesting that you should convey the directive to whoever is to comply.
 1st person inclusiveInterrogatives used with essentially the same force as 1st person inclusive imperatives
generally begin with shall we or why :
[46] i Shall we go for a swim?
ii Why don’t we eat out tonight? Why waste our time on it?
At the direct level, [i] is a direction question whose answers are expressed by 1st person
inclusive imperatives: in context the question is biased towards the positive answer, “Let’s
go for a swim”, which it therefore indirectly conveys.","[959, 960, 961]"
"Example [i] illustrates the case where a question is used to indicate surprised or interested
acknowledgement of new information. B’s Is he? is not an inquiry: it doesn’t seek to find
out the answer, for A has just provided it, and B is not challenging what A has said. In
[ii] I am wondering, not inquiring – probably not asking for an answer (much less ‘the’
answer). Question [iii] might be used in a quiz or exam: in this case it’s not an inquiry
since presumably I already know the answer, my aim being to test whether you do. And
[iv] is intended as an expository question. Instead of asking you for the answer, I am
directing your attention to a question whose answer I’m about to give you. Other cases
of questions that are not inquiries include indirect speech acts like Could you turn your
radio down a little or Isn’t she fantastic! ([11] of §3), where the question force is secondary
and very much backgrounded.
In comparison with a statement, a question on its own is informationally incomplete:
it needs the answer to complete it. In an utterance with question as its primary force, I
draw attention to this need for a completing answer. What we are calling an inquiry is
then the special, but most common, case where I ask you to provide this answer.",[887]
"4.7.2 Declarative questions
Positive declarative questions have an epistemic bias towards a positive answer, negative
ones towards a negative answer:
[38]a. They’ve finished?b. They haven’t finished?",[901]
"Moreover, the closed interrogative cannot contain an or-coordination marking an alternative question: ∗I doubt whether he wrote it or not; ∗I doubt whether they’ll appoint a man
or a woman (in the sense “uncertain which it will be”). From a semantic point of view,
indeed, it is arguable that the interrogative clause in [45a] does not express a question
at all but simply a proposition: it is equivalent to a declarative.
14The verb question takes open interrogatives as oblique complements (e.g. He questioned them about where they
had been): we are concerned with core complements, as in He questioned whether such drastic measures were
really necessary. An exceptional use of an open interrogative here is seen in It might be questioned what he does
learn at school, but this is interpreted as “whether he does learn anything”, with the suggestion that the answer
is negative.",[1003]
"899900Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary forceIt is important to note, however, that the presupposition may follow not from the answer
alone, but from the answer together with the premise that it is an answer. Consider [9i] and
the sample of responses given in [ii]:
[9]i a. What Soviet president won the Nobel Peace Prize?
b. “Some Soviet president won the Nobel Peace Prize”
ii a. Mikhail Gorbachov won the Nobel Peace Prize.
b. Leonid Brezhnev won the Nobel Peace Prize.
c. Willy Brandt won the Nobel Peace Prize.[question]
[presupposition]The right answer is [iia], but this does not by itself entail [ib]: we need the additional
premise “Mikhail Gorbachov is/was a Soviet president”. Though false, [iib] is still an answer.
By contrast, [iic] is true, but not a true answer, because the additional premise – “Willy
Brandt is/was a Soviet president” – is false. Presuppositions thus play a significant role in the
interpretation of responses to variable questions. If you interpret a response as an answer you
add to its content whatever additional premise is needed for the presupposition to be entailed.
No such additional premises are needed with alternative and polar questions. Here the presupposition is a disjunction of the answers, and since any proposition “p” entails “p or q”, any
one answer will always entail the disjunction of the set of answers. In [1], for example, if “He is
leaving on Monday” is true, then obviously “He is leaving on Monday or Tuesday” is also true.","[919, 920]"
"In [i], assuming that B does not consider the possibility that A intended to deceive,
B will be in no doubt that A didn’t know that Ms Jones went overseas yesterday, i.e.
that the answer to the question is negative. Nor is there any doubt in [ii]: A has just
given the answer, and B accepts it. Where the bias is complete, as here, the question
cannot have the force of an inquiry: the intention is not to elicit information. In [i]
the question serves to inform A that Ms Jones went overseas yesterday: it is an indirect
statement. In [ii] the question serves to acknowledge the information A has just supplied
(cf. [3i] above).
Complete bias can also be found with variable questions, as in Who’s a clever girl? In a context
where the addressee or the speaker is a girl who has just done something clever, there will be
no doubt as to what is the value for the variable in “x is a clever girl”, and the question will
therefore indirectly convey “What a clever girl you are!” or “What a clever girl I am!”.
 The encoding of biasThe inference that a question is biased towards a particular answer may be based simply
on the context, together with assumptions about the speaker’s intentions. This is likely
to be the case in [35], for example. In other cases, bias may be reflected in the prosodic
properties of the question. For example,
[37]Have you any idea how much these knives cost?could be used as an indirect way of inquiring about the cost of the knives or as a rebuke to
someone considered to be misusing a certain knife. In the first case there is some positive
desiderative bias (I am no doubt hoping for a positive answer to the direct question, for
otherwise you will not be able to answer the indirect question about the cost, the one I
am primarily interested in), but it could be epistemically quite neutral (I have no reason
to think that one answer rather than the other is actually the right one). In the rebuke
use, on the other hand, there will be a strong negative epistemic bias: the suggestion is
that the maltreatment of the knife indicates lack of awareness of its value.
Our focus in what follows will be on the grammatical marking of bias, on cases where
the bias is reflected in the grammatical structure of the question. Declarative questions
and negative interrogative questions are always quite strongly biased; note that neither
of these would occur in the kind of context attested for the neutral question [32i]. In
addition, a weaker bias can be conveyed by the use of positively- and negatively-oriented
polarity-sensitive items, such as some and any. We take these three cases in turn; see also
§5.2 for bias in tag questions.",[901]
"§ 4.5 Variable questions Answers to multi-variable questionsMulti-variable questions may have either singulary answers or multiple answers:
[20] i Who beat who?
ii Kim beat Max.
iii Kim beat Max and Pat beat Bob.[singulary answer]
[multiple answer]A singulary answer simply provides a single value for each variable. A multiple answer
provides sets of values – pairs if there are two variables, triples if there are three, and so on.
Thus for “x beat y” in question [20i], the singulary answer [ii] provides the value “Kim”
for “x ” and “Max” for “y”, whereas the multiple answer [iii] provides the pairs {“Kim”,
“Max”} and {“Pat”, “Bob”} for the variable pair {“x”, “y”}. For example, [ii] might be
the answer when the question is used to inquire about the final match in some sporting
competition, [iii] when it is used to inquire about the semi-finals.
A two-variable question with multiple answers can be used as an inquiry in a range
of contexts differing with respect to what information I already have, as opposed to that
which I am seeking to obtain:
[21] i I don’t know the values of either variable.
ii I know the values of one variable but not the other.
iii I know the values for both variables, but not how they are paired.
Answer [20iii] would be used under condition [21i] when I simply know that two
matches took place but don’t know who the players were, or I know who played but
not who won or lost. A context where [21ii] applies would be one where I know who has
won through to the final but want to know who they beat in the semi-finals. Context
[21iii] would obtain if I knew who was playing in the semi-finals and ask Who beat
who? to find out the results. Or [21iii] might similarly apply to the answer to such a
question as Who’s going to teach which courses this semester? A likely context for this
is the planning of a teaching-programme when we know who the teaching staff are
and what the courses are: it is then just a matter of matching teachers with courses.
Multiple answer vs multiple response
Single-variable questions (and multi-variable ones where the variables are coordinate, as
in [18]) have only singulary answers. Again, however, we need to invoke the distinction
between answer and response, for sometimes a single-variable question can receive a multiple
response:
[22] i Where did she buy these books?
ii She bought them at Heffer’s.
iii She bought them at Heffer’s and Dillon’s.
iv She bought this one at Heffer’s and that one at Dillon’s.","[894, 895]"
"§ 17 Evaluative adjunctsNevertheless, there are certainly cases where a modal adjunct is in the scope of a
question. Will he probably die? seems quite reasonable, and Won’t he probably die? is
fully acceptable; the negative question here is biased towards the positive answer He
will probably die. Similarly, examples like [11], or their positive counterparts, can readily
be questioned. Because epistemic necessarily predominantly occurs in the scope of a
negative, a question like Are those who do best at school necessarily the cleverest? is typically
biased towards a negative answer.
 Double modalityIt is perfectly possible to have more than one modal qualification, but no more than one
can normally be expressed by means of an adverb. Compare, for example:
[13] i It is certainly possible that he told her. / Certainly he may have told her.
ii ∗Certainly he possibly /perhaps told her.
 Other formsA few PPs have meanings very similar to those of adverbs listed above: without doubt/
question, in all probability/likelihood. There are others with no close adverbial equivalent,
such as in my opinion/judgement, and the like. According to Kim belongs in a group with
allegedly in absolving me from personal responsibility for the assertion, but specifies who
is responsible for it. Parentheticals also very often serve to indicate epistemic status, and
conditional adjuncts too can function in this way:
[14] i a. You didn’t do it on purpose, I’m sure.
b. One of you, she suggests, should write a report for the local paper.
ii a. If I’m not mistaken, that’s a kookaburra over there.
b. We’re in for a wet week-end if the weather forecast is anything to go by.","[790, 791]"
"921922Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force8.2 Meaning and use of exclamative main clauses
Exclamative utterances normally have the force of exclamatory statements. Consider
again our initial example:
[14]How much remains to be done! (=[1ia])At the most general level of classification we include this in the statement family because of
its resemblance to the straightforward statement Much remains to be done. The meaning
of the latter is contained within that of the exclamative.
Nevertheless, exclamative utterances are by no means prototypical statements. The
exclamatory component gives them a strongly subjective quality, so that they are not
presented as statements of fact. Rather, they express the speaker’s strong emotional
reaction or attitude to some situation. The exclamative indicates that the situation obtains
(e.g. [14] indicates that much remains to be done), and this is the statement component of
the meaning – but this component is backgrounded relative to the emotive exclamatory
component. Several more specific properties follow from this general account.
In the first place, because the statement component is backgrounded it is presented as
uncontroversial, not at issue. Thus one normally doesn’t envisage disagreement, dispute.
This is reflected in the use of interrogative tags:
[15] i What a disaster it was, wasn’t it!
ii ?What a disaster it was, was it![reversed polarity tag]
[constant polarity tag]Example [i] (with falling intonation on the tag) is possible because such a tag can be
used to seek agreement – but note that it is agreement with the subjective attitude
(that the situation is remarkable), not just the statement component. However, [ii]
would not normally be used because the constant polarity tag in this case would be
seeking acknowledgement of the statement component, which is inconsistent with its
background status.
Secondly, exclamatives do not give answers to (non-echo) questions: How I enjoyed
it! is not an answer, and a very unlikely response, to Did you enjoy it? In part, this
relates to what we have said about the backgrounded status of the statement component:
information giving the answer to an explicit question will normally be foregrounded.
But a more important reason is the semantic one that exclamative how and what express
variables rather than constants. The construction indicates that the value of the variable
is remarkable, but does not explicitly specify what it is. This is why exclamative utterances
are not naturally assessed as true or false. Thus one would hardly express agreement by
saying Yes, that’s true: more normal would be something like Yes, indeed, or – where the
exclamative phrase is non-subject – a reduced interrogative, such as Yes, didn’t she! in
response to How she hated it!
 The resemblance between exclamatives and open interrogativesThe property of expressing a variable is of course common to both exclamative and
interrogative uses of how and what, and it is a very widespread phenomenon in the
world’s languages that exclamative clauses bear strong formal resemblances to open
interrogatives. (Because subject–auxiliary inversion generally does not apply in English
exclamatives, their resemblance is greater to subordinate interrogatives, and this too
is illustrative of the most common pattern.) We have seen that closed interrogatives§ 8.3 Non-exclamative exclamationslike Wasn’t it a disaster! or Did she hate it! are also commonly used as exclamatory
statements, but with these the force is indirect: at the direct level, they are questions.
In the exclamative construction, however, the exclamatory statement force has been
grammaticalised: in spite of the resemblance, exclamatives are grammatically distinct
from open interrogatives, as we have noted above, and they do not belong in the semantic
category of question.
Exclamatives have a narrower range of uses than the other major clause types. And
there are no cases where they are conventionally used with some indirect force, as various
kinds of declarative and interrogative are used as indirect directives, or imperatives as
components of conditional statements, and so on.","[941, 942, 943]"
"In its salient interpretation [ia] presupposes that Max is naughty and asks for the cause,
or explanation. Question [ib] can be used in a similar way, but I’m more likely to use
it to ask for evidence or justification for the claim that I’m naughty: the presupposition
is cancelled in this use, whether I’m naughty being the main issue, not something that
is taken for granted. (A similar interpretation is possible for [ia], but the so makes it less
likely.) Why questions with presupposition cancellation often contain modal should, as
noted in §6.6. Example [iia] allows a face value interpretation where the presupposition
is retained: “Why is it that you don’t go to the beach?”, but it can also be used when I
don’t think there is any valid reason and the cancellation of the presupposition results in
an indirect directive: “You should go to the beach”. The other three examples have only
this directive interpretation: see §4.5.
 Direction questions and to-infinitivalsUnlike the other interrogative words, why is not normally possible in direction questions.
Thus %Why shall I get my money back? can only be an information question, with answers
like You will get your money back because the manufacturer has accepted responsibility for
the defect. In to-infinitivals, why is just possible in the titular use: Why to vote yes in the
referendum.
13Whereabouts can be used instead of where to indicate that only an approximate answer is envisaged. However,
the noun whereabouts (derived from the preposition by shift of stress from the last syllable to the first) is not
an interrogative word: His whereabouts aren’t known is declarative and has no embedded interrogative clause
within it. Interrogative whence (“from where”) and whither (“to where”) are archaic. So too is wherein, which
is the only one of the compounds of interrogative where + preposition that one is likely to encounter; its
archaic status is seen in the fact that it does not require do-support but allows inversion of subject + lexical
verb, as in Wherein lies its appeal?",[926]
"5 Interrogative content clauses
Subordinate interrogatives, like main clause interrogatives, normally express questions,
but because they are embedded there is no illocutionary force associated with them. A
main clause interrogative such as Where was she born? is characteristically used to ask a
question, i.e. as an inquiry, but the subordinate counterpart where she was born is not. It
nevertheless expresses the same question as the main clause, with the same set of possible
answers. As will be evident from this formulation, we continue to maintain a distinction
between categories of grammatical form and categories of meaning: interrogative applies
to the formal category, question to the semantic one.
Subordinate interrogatives are used in reporting inquiries, as in They asked where
she was born, but have numerous other uses too, as in They know where she was born
or It depends where she was born. We refer to the questions they express as embedded
questions, avoiding the traditional term ‘indirect question’ for reasons given in Ch. 10,
§3.2. In the default case, sentences whose meaning contains an embedded question can
be glossed with the formula ‘the answer to the question’ – thus for the examples just
given, “They know / It depends on the answer to the question ‘Where was she born?’ ”.",[992]
