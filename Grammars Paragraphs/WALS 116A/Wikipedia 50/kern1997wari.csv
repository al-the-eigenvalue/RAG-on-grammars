something already mentioned or implied.

expecting either an affirmative or negative answer, unless marked by the special
‘rhetorical’ uses of VICS. See next section.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Leading questions Yes-no questions are often expressed in the form of
leading questions using ra ‘2s:rf’, ron ‘2s:rf-3sm’, ram ‘2s:rf-3sf’, roron ‘2s:rf-3pm’,
raram ‘2s:rf-3pf’, or rain ‘2s:rf-3n’. In addition, yes-no questions may also be expressed
in the form of leading questions using xin (1pincl:rf-3n) in conjunction with the sentencefinal particles ne ‘rec. past’ and/or pane ‘rem:past’, with either declarative or
interrogative intonation. A final type of leading question uses na' nam ‘3s:rp/p 3s:rp/p3sf’ (addressing a mixed or feminine audience) and na' non ‘3s:rp/p 3s:rp/p-3sm’
(addressing a masculine audience).
Ra (ron ‘2s:rf-3sm’, ram ‘2s:rf-3sf’, roron ‘2s:rf-3pm’, raram ‘2s:rf-3pf’, rain ‘2s:rf3n’) can be used in two different ways: (i) when used in an affirmative sentence with
interrogative intonation, it demands a negative answer; when used in a negative sentence
with interrogative intonation, it demands an affirmative answer; and (ii) when used with
declarative intonation, it demands agreement. We have italicized the leading question
particles and their glosses in the following examples.

The focus of neutral yes-no questions is marked by increased loudness and higher pitch
on the stressed syllable of the element in focus (see 1.11.2.1.1). The focus of leading yesno questions is marked by the use of second person realis future VICS (see 1.1.1.2.1.2),
where a positive question expects a negative answer, and vice versa. Only the subject can
be focused in this manner. So in (373a), for example, ron indicates that the focus is on
Xijam, and in (373b), ram indicates that the focus is on third person singular feminine.

Question-word questions take the form of COMP sentences. The question word always

the functions that operator words signal, the basic structure of COMP sentences, and the

occur, though rarely. It is, however, possible to construct a (rather unnatural) sentence

clause constituents cannot be questioned. In what follows, we illustrate the way
information from the various types of subordinate clauses can be questioned. But none of
these involves actual question-word formation. We have already seen that question words
may not remain in situ but that they must appear sentence-initial, i.e. in the COMP
position. If we assume that question words must appear in the matrix COMP but that
movement out of subordinate clauses is prohibited, we derive the fact that subordinate
clause constituents cannot be questioned. Let us now turn to consider how information
from subordinate clauses can be questioned.
We begin first with verbalized or direct speech sentences.
(i) Verbalized (direct speech type) sentences
Direct objects, indirect objects and subjects of verbalized (direct speech type) sentences
(supposition, direct speech and future tense), such as those found in (16), (17) and (18)
may be inquired about, as shown in (16) to (18). If the matrix clause is expressed, then
only the entire purpose clause may be questioned, as in (19).

"Ca'nacocon.sugarthis:n3s:rp/pprep:3pm‘A small knife, pills, soap, sugar, thus it was for them.’First and second person emphatic pronouns are frequently used in answer to questions of

"Tarapata'ta'a.3s:rfprep:1semph‘I doubt it.’ (‘I don’t at all know about myself.’)There is another uncertainty response, na ne, which is the third person singular realis
past/present VIC plus the recent past-uncertainty particle. This response is often given in
answer to question-word questions consisting of je in COMP and xi ‘irrealis’ in INFL. Je
xi questions, because of their irrealis tense/mood character, can be interpreted as mild
imperatives (see 1.1.1.3.3, where we describe this and other irrealis constructions
appearing as mild imperatives). Na ne, as a response to such questions/ imperatives,
expresses the notion of ‘I wish you hadn’t asked’ or ‘I wish you hadn’t said that’, an
idiomatic but frequent reading of na ne.

constituent can be questioned at a time.

it means ‘(Somebody) probably (knows)’ or ‘(It) probably (depends).’ It frequently
occurs followed by an inflected form of the preposition, for example, tara con (3s:rf
prep:3sm) which could be translated as ‘I don’t know about him’, or ‘that depends on
him’. Tara alone or with an inflected form of the preposition may also be followed by the

Anaphora is expressed by deletion in the following circumstances: (1) deletion of the
matrix clause in direct speech sentences; (2) deletion of any or all of the constituents
except the verb in long discourses; (3) deletion of any or all of the main constituents other
than the VICS in response to statements or questions; (4) deletion of any or all of the

(1) Deletion of the matrix clause in direct speech sentences
Direct speech occurs as the derived predicate of a verbalized direct speech sentence
(see 1.1.1.1). Subject VICS mark the speaker, and object VICS (suffixes) mark to whom
or of whom the speech is made. The matrix clause (all elements other than the embedded
speech) is often deleted in narrative discourse. This is especially common when
recounting a dialogue. The example in (308) is taken from text.

Interrogative sentences in 'ON belong to two separate classes: simple and COMP
sentences. See 1.1.1.4.2 for a complete discussion of interrogative sentences and their
relation to declarative sentences. The basic structure of simple yes-no and leading
questions is described in 1.1.1.2.1–2, and the basic structure of COMP question-word
questions is described in 1.1.1.4.2.
There is only one basic intonation pattern in the language: rising pitch through the
verb, reaching high on the last syllable of the verb, and falling sharply on the next
syllable (VIC or postverbal modifier that does not carry stress); it then holds through any
optional arguments until the end of the sentence, or until a demonstrative or sentencefinal particle, in which case it rises on the last syllable of the argument preceding theSyntax11demonstrative or particle and falls sharply on the demonstrative or particle (see 3.3.4). In
normal speech, the succeeding high pitch is lower than the first high pitch. When there is
emphasis, however, on an argument following the first high pitch, the pitch on the
emphasized argument is higher than the first high pitch—see 3.3.4.1–2 and 1.11.2.1.1.
Interrogative and declarative intonation patterns are basically the same, differing only in
the fact that the pitches of intonation are higher in interrogatives than in declaratives.

kill2p:rp/pfishthat:prox:hearerrefchildren‘Did you kill fish, children?’(4d) and (5) differ intonationally, because in (5), it is hwam rather than pa' that is

1.1.1.2.1. Yes-no questions
Simple yes-no interrogative sentences are similar to simple declarative sentences (see
1.1.1.4.1.) in their basic structure: both use any of the three subtypes of Tense or reflexive
verbal inflectional clitics. Interrogative intonation, however, distinguishes yes-no
interrogatives from declarative sentences.","[23, 24]"

COMP sentences are distinguished from simple and verbalized sentences by the
following criteria:
1 They have an overt expression in their sentence-initial position, or COMP, what we will
refer to as ‘operator words’ or ‘COMP words’.
2 An INFL morpheme usually follows the operator word. This is because Tense must
appear in second position of the sentence (with few exceptions, to be noted in the
course of our discussion)—see 2.1.8.2.5.
3 Tenseless VICS usually follow the verb in the VP (there are exceptions to this, noted in
the paragraph preceding (64) and the paragraph following (73)).
By ‘operator word’, we mean a word which sets the value of a particular logical
connective for the entire sentence, or which is interpreted logically as binding a variable
in the sentence. By ‘INFL’, we mean a preverbal word which gives information about
tense, mood and in some cases gender. That operator words are separate syntactic words,
and not prefixes, can be shown in information questions, where questioned NPS can be
placed between the operator word and INFL. Also, some operator words form
compounds with different nouns or demonstratives in preverbal positions, as shown in
some of the examples which follow ((68a), (73e–f), (74c), (82c–e)). This is also not
expected if these are prefixes. We analyse INFL as a separate morpheme, because the
language otherwise lacks prefixes, although nothing crucial for our descriptive task here
hinges on this.
There are ten COMP words in 'ON that appear in matrix or embedded clauses, and
one, pain, that serves exclusively to introduce subordinate clauses. Some of these COMP
words also interact with certain pre-/post-verbal modifiers and verbs in order to express
different types of interrogation. These COMP words select for specific INFL morphemes
to accompany them, as discussed below. COMP words occur elsewhere in the language
in different word classes, as shown in Table 1.1, where we list each COMP word with its
basic meaning as well as the function it signals as a COMP word—see also 2.2.2.3.
‘Interrogation’ means question-word interrogation.
Three operator words (mo, 'ac, and 'ane) can occur only with declarative intonation;
four (mon, mam, main and cain') can occur only with interrogative intonation (see,
however, 1.2.1.1, where mon, mam and main also appear with declarative intonation in
copular-type sentences); and four ma', 'om, je and pain) can occur with either declarative
or interrogative intonation. Table 1.2 illustrates this. When ma' occurs with interrogative
intonation, it asks a question-word question; when 'om and pain occur with interrogative
intonation, they ask a yes-no question; when je occursWari'42Table 1.1 COMP operator words: form and function

There are five INFL morphemes in 'ON. They appear in INFL following COMP in
COMP sentences: ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, co ‘masculine/ feminine realis
past/present’, ‘iri’ ‘realis past/present’, ta ‘realis future’, and xi ‘irrealis’. Since INFL
morphemes express tense/mood in COMP sentences (and elsewhere, in noun and relative
clauses), they may not co-occur with a Tense VIC, except as mentioned in the following
paragraph. See also 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.2.3 below. INFL morphemes indicate the gender of
the (overt or covert) word or phrase in COMP.
While Tenseless VICS are usually the only VICS which appear in COMP sentences,
the Tense third person realis past/present VICS must occur when a masculine/feminine
subject is referenced in COMP (whether overt or covert; this does not necessarily hold for
relative clauses—see the discussion on relative clauses in 1.1.2.3, where it is shown that
in some cases, no VIC follows the verb. See also (64d) below). So, for example, a Tense
VIC is required when questioning a masculine/feminine subject, which always involvesSyntax43an overt COMP word (64a–b), or when relativizing the masculine/feminine subject,
which always involves a covert COMP (64c–d).

prohibitive sentences are similar in basic structure to COMP sentence types, which,
among others, include question-word questions, conditional, negative and purpose
sentences. They differ from most COMP sentences in that no operator word occurs in
COMP (see 2.1.8.2.5). The realis future INFL morpheme occurs sentence-initially and
the emphatic morpheme me usually occurs at the end of the sentence. The occurrence of
me and other sentence-final particles are, however, optional.

Xin is the first person plural inclusive realis future VIC suffixed by the third person
neuter object VIC. It may also be used idiomatically as a leading question particle, which
reveals a measure of curiosity or amazement on the part of the speaker and expects an
affirmative answer. It is often accompanied by the temporal particles ne ‘recent past’ or
pane ‘remote past’, and more rarely the referent particle quem, or the emphatic particle
ta. Ne is the most common particle to occur with xin. It occurs sentence-finally and seems
to have the following functions in many environments: it modifies the verb in some
subordinate sentences (see time clauses—1.1.2.4.2.1; and contraexpective clauses—
1.1.2.4.2.8); it is a type of ‘attention-getter’, drawing attention to a spoken or unspoken
situation (i.e. ‘I’m expecting a response from you’); it expresses uncertainty; and as one
of a set of temporal particles, it means ‘recent/ immediate past’. When occurring with xin,
it seems to function as an ‘attention-getter’. No doubt its meaning of uncertainty or
recent/ immediate past also plays a role here, and since another temporal particle, pane
‘rem:past’ also appears with xin, we will gloss ne as a temporal particle in leading
questions.

ma-inthat:prox:hearer-nINFL:nrp/pgo:s2s-3n(lit.) ‘Where are you going to it?’We now describe the use of each operator word, the INFL morpheme(s) which it selects,
and its meanings. The first example following the introduction of each operator word
illustrates the operator word in what we consider to be its basic function. The subsequent
examples illustrate its functions in COMP.
(1) Ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’
When ma' is followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/ present’, it
signals interrogation and expresses the notion of ‘what?’, ‘why?’ or ‘how?’ Since the
questioned element is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS follow the verb. When ma' expresses
the notion of ‘why?’, it frequently employs the use of the preverbal modifier para
‘therefore’ and/or the verb mi' ‘give’ occurring in postverbal modifier position. Both of
these verbal modifiers are optional, but one or the other is usually used in ‘why?’
questions. The three sentences in (73b–d) are synonymous and have the same
distribution, so far as we can tell. Note the examples in (73e–f), where a noun follows
ma' to form a COMP phrase and asks specifically ‘What thing do you want?’ and ‘What
day will the chief come?’ (73a) shows ma' appearing in its nonderived form as a
demonstrative.

and, since the questioned element is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS are used. When main
expresses the notion of ‘where?’, it employs the use of the verbs pe/to ‘to be (s/p)’, 'ac ‘to

"Pacaraximne?long:agonightrec:past‘It is late.’ (lit. ‘(The) night (is) long ago.’)(2) VIC sentences are characterized by the presence of a VIC without a verb. The VIC
may occur alone or with a sentence-final particle (382a–b) or an inflected form of the
preposition (382c) (these three examples are responses to questions or statements); see,
however, (382d), in which there is a subject in the form of a noun clause, and (382e),
where a coordinated construction serves as the subject of the clause. The VIC sentence
appears as a direct speech in (382e). (382d–e) are ‘closures’ to discourses. Structurally, it
could be said that these sentences are the matrix clauses of complex direct speeches, i.e.
the entire discourses.

be used. The ra form only occurs in the sentence-final position. When one of the
variations is used, it either occurs sentence-final, or, if there is an expressed subject of the
