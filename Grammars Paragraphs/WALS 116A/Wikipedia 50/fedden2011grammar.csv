"IntroductionThis chapter deals with the formation of questions. Formally, there are five
different types of question in Mian. Questions can employ:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)only the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a at the end of the sentence
bleka ‘or’ at the end of the sentence, and no interrogative clitic =a
the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a at the end of the sentence and
bleka ‘or’ inside the sentence (separating two alternatives)
the interrogative illocutionary clitic =e plus an interrogative phrase with
either fàb ‘where’ or wan ‘who’
the topic clitic =leFunctionally, these can be assigned to the following types:
Types (1) and (2) are polar questions, i.e. questions for which the
appropriate answer is ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
Type (3) are alternative questions, where the speaker wants a specification
of the offered alternatives, e.g. Do you want pork or fish for dinner?.
Type (4) are content questions, which are used to request information about
the who, what, when, etc. of an event or action. Content questions consist of a
proposition which is completely presupposed apart from one element, which is
the one queried (Givón 1990: 714-715). In Mian, the maximum number of
queried constituents is one. Thus, multiple constituent questions, such as
English Who did what?, are not possible.
Type (5) are topic-only questions, in which only a topic is given, as in
English What about John? or And you?. The speaker has a particular question
in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied question is.",[411]
"Polar questionsThe appropriate answer for a polar question is ‘yes’ or ‘no’, which are ae and
yeye in Mian, respectively. They are formed with the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a. Very rarely, one finds polar questions with =e (which is
usually used for content questions). Like all illocutionary particles (see38610. Question formation3.13.1), =a encliticizes to the immediately preceding word and forms a single
prosodic word with it. A second type of polar question ends with bleka ‘or’.
Intonationally, polar questions are characterized by a short intonational
peak and subsequent fall on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is
formed by the illocutionary particle or the final syllable of bleka ‘or’.","[411, 412]"
"Polar questions with the interrogative clitic =aPolar questions can involve verbal and non-verbal predicates. In the former
case, the illocutionary particle cliticizes to the verb, in the latter case, the
particle cliticizes to the non-verbal predicate term.
The interrogative clitic =a is realized as =ya when following /a/, e.g.
naka=ya? ‘A man?’. After emphatic and restrictive pronouns, which end in
the emphatic suffix -ta, the interrogative clitic =a is also realized as =ya, but
here the preceding /a/ is deleted, e.g. kb-ta ‘you (M, EMPH)’ and kb-t=ya? ‘Is
it you?’, y-ta ‘only this (restrictive)’ and y-t=ya? ‘Is it only this?’
In polar questions involving verbal predications the interrogative particle
cliticizes to the finite verb, as in the formulaic greeting in (1):
(1)klayâm
bi-Ø-eb=a?
properly_good
stay.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q
‘Are you (staying) well?’ [Observed]Constituent order does not change in questions. The declarative marker =be,
the emphatic/quotative marker =bo, or the exclamative marker =ble are simply
replaced by =a and the utterance receives a marked intonational contour as
opposed to the corresponding declarative sentence. Compare the polar
question in (2) and its declarative counterpart in (3):

small10.1. Polar questions387bi-Ø-e=be
stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘Your boy is still small.’
The verb in (2) is pronounced bia. On this unusual contracted form, see
section 8.6.5, where irregularities in the inflection of the existential verb are
described.
Optionally, polar questions can additionally contain the interrogative clitic
m (as opposed to negative mo with low tone). This typically encliticizes to
the final constituent before the predicate, as in (4), but can appear as a free
word if it occurs clause initially, as in example (15) below.

DEM.N2=Qgo-ˆb’-o-bi-Ø-eb=a?
like.PFV-give.PFV-N2.R-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q
‘Do you like this song?’
As with the negative clitic mo, interrogative m may only occur once per
sentence. Thus, it may only appear once in any given clause chain, which
constitutes one sentence. Usually this would be the first clause to signal right
from the start that a question is coming:

again
close-REAL-2SG.SBJ-GPST=Q
‘Did you open and again close the window?’ [TMA Questionnaire,
61]
The interrogative marker =a can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to query whether the addressee wants the speaker or the group of which
both speaker and addressee are members to perform a certain action:
(6)ayal=e
kemela-n-an=a?

‘Shall I extinguish the light?’ [Observed]38810. Question formation(7)un-Ø-om=a?
go.PFV-REAL-1PL.SBJ.HORT=Q
‘Shall we go?’ [Observed]In polar questions involving non-verbal predications the interrogative particle
attaches to either a noun (8), an emphatic pronoun (9), a distal demonstrative
(10), an adjective (11), or an adverb (12). The interrogative clitic m may not
be used. The range of possible hosts for the clitic is exactly co-extensive with
the range of word classes that can appear in the predicate slot in declarative
non-verbal clauses. Detailed information on non-verbal clauses can be found
in section 9.11.

‘Yes, it’s slowly.’10.1. Polar questions10.1.2.","[412, 413, 414, 415]"
"389Polar questions with bleka ‘or’ at the end of the sentenceAnother way of forming a polar question is using bleka ‘or’ at the end of the
sentence. In that case, there is no illocutionary clitic. This is illustrated for a
non-verbal predication in (14), and a sentence whose predicate is a finite verb,
in which case the interrogative clitic m is commonly used (15):
(14)(15)yi=e
yi
bleka?
wound or
wound=SG.N1
‘A wound, is it a wound?’ (lit. ‘A wound, a wound, or?’) [Pig story]
m

hear.IPFV-DS.SIM-2SG.SBJ=MEDo-b-i
say.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJbleka?
or
‘Do you understand what I’m saying?’
(Lit: ‘Are you hearing as I’m saying, or?’) [Mianmin and Telefomin]
Questions with bleka ‘or’ at the end are not leading but rather neutral polar
questions that introduce the (implied) negation of the proposition as a second
alternative, which is equally probable. Thus, the alternatives offered in (14)
are that the referent either is a wound or is not a wound. This is a type of polar
question because the appropriate responses are ‘yes’ or ‘no’.",[415]
"Alternative questions with bleka ‘or’When using an alternative question the speaker expects the addressee to
specify one of two alternatives offered rather than just say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. They
are formed with the interrogative clitic =a and do not involve a change of
constituent order. The maximum number of alternatives is two. The
conjunction bleka ‘or’ conjoins the elements denoting the alternative options
in polar questions. These can be two noun phrases, as in (16), or two
sentences, as in (17):
(16)kbo

or
‘Are you staying in the village today or are you going to the garden?’
If the alternatives given are instantiated by noun phrases each needs an
emphatic pronoun in adnominal position, as in (16) above, not just an article.
The use of the interrogative clitic m in alternative questions is unattested.","[415, 416]"
"10.2. Content questions391The interrogative words fàb and wan neither encode number nor gender.
Emphatic pronouns, which can be compounded with both fàb and wan, have
to encode number and in the third person singular also gender. Mian
interrogative words do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites, as interrogatives do for example in Japanese (Nichigauchi 1990)
or in the Australian languages Kayardild (Evans 1995: 365) and Kuuk
Thaayorre (Gaby 2006: 243-244). Both fàb and wan can be used pronominally
and adnominally.
Content questions in Mian usually have declarative (i.e. falling) intonation,
but can be intonationally marked by a quick rise and subsequent fall of pitch
on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is invariably formed by the
illocutionary particle. This intonational pattern is very similar to the one found
in polar questions.
The interrogative clitic =e can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to indicate that the speaker assumes that the addressee wants this action
to be performed by the speaker (or by a group to which both speaker and
addressee belong), e.g.:
(20)fàb
o-fâ-n-an=e?
where
3SG.RESID.O-put.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ.HORT =CQ
‘Where shall I put it?’ [Observed]Interrogative phrases, which contain the interrogative words fàb and wan,
always appear in situ, i.e. they occur in the same position as non-interrogative
phrases with the same grammatical function (Li and Thompson 1984: 51,
Dryer 2005).
As in polar and alternative questions, constituent order is not changed with
respect to the corresponding declarative sentence and the interrogative phrase
occupies the position which the queried constituent would have in an
appropriate answer sentence.
There are a few cases where the interrogative phrase seems to be not in situ
but rather to be postposed after the verb. I will turn to this issue in more detail
below.","[416, 417]"
"Interjections and formulaic utterancesInterjections are particles which express assent or dissent, emotional states,
and hesitation in speech. Due to the fact that interjections are usually uttered
with a marked intonation, and the difficulty of teasing apart lexical tone and
intonation, I will not mark tone on interjections. The inventory comprises:
(211) ae, ai
ayasi
ayo
ba (< baa ‘say’)
dowe
ekskyus (from Tok Pisin)
klâye
o
yait, yaiks (from Tok Pisin)
yle, yle
yeye‘yes’
‘expressing surprise or disbelief’
‘sorry (feeling regret or pity)’
‘ehm (hesitation in speech)’
‘boah man’
‘excuse me’
‘well now’
‘oh’
‘yuck’
‘well (also hesitation)’
‘no’The interjection ayo can only express regret and is not used for apologies.
I think it is plausible that ba ‘ehm’ indicating hesitation goes back to the
verb stem baa ‘say (PFV)’. As bare verb stems are commonly used as
imperatives, it is conceivable that speakers used the imperative form baa
[mbà] ‘Say (it)!’ to “order themselves” to continue speaking. Synchronically,
however, the interjection ba is not pronounced with a pharyngealized /a/.
In the eastern dialect, there are no interjections for the purpose of greeting
people. Instead whole formulaic sentences are exchanged. The following
patterns of question and answer are customary:
Arriving party says:
bo y bliba? — ‘Are you (PL) there?’
klayâm bieba? — ‘Are you well?’Customary answer:
ae, n y biobobe — ‘Yes, we are there.’
ae, klayâm blibe — ‘Yes, I am well.’Departing party says:
klayâm biebte! — ‘Stay well!’Customary answer:
klayâm one! — ‘Go well!’3.14. Grammatical relations163In the morning:
(klayâm) seba? — ‘Did you sleep (well)?’Customary answer:
(ae, klayâm) sibe — ‘(Yes,) I have
slept (well).’Going to sleep:
klayâm áan one! — ‘(Go to) Sleep well!’Customary anwser:
kbsa klayâm áan one! — ‘You too (go
to) sleep well!’Both parties meet (on a path):
kbo y tleba? — ‘You have come to
this place.’Customary answer:
(ae,) y tlibe ‘(Yes,) I have come to this
place?’In the western dialect area, the form klayâmo ‘really good’ is commonly used
to say hello or bid farewell to somebody. Speakers of the eastern dialect do
not have this convention.","[188, 189]"
"Topic-only questionsTopic-only questions are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is given,
as in English What about John? or And you? The speaker has a particular
question in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied
question is, normally something that would have been asked immediately
before about a different discourse participant or something that was
anticipated by a statement, such as I’m going. What about you? (Implied: Are
you going as well?). In Mian topic-only questions are formed by using a free
pronoun or noun phrase and the low-toned topic clitic =le. In the examples
below, possible implied questions are given in brackets. If context is lacking
the default interpretation of a topic-only question would be about the topic’s
whereabouts:
(58)bo=le?
2SG.F=TOP
‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
‘What do you want to eat?’)10.3. Topic-only questions(59)403=le?
3SG.F=TOP
‘What about Leoni?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Leoni doing?’,
‘Where is Leoni?’)
LeoniPNTopic-only questions are a special case because they do not display any of the
usual strategies to mark an utterance as a question in Mian. As can be seen
from the two examples above, there are no interrogative words nor do any
interrogative particles occur.
I assume that there are two reasons why (58) and (59) are readily
interpreted as topic-only questions though they do not bear any of the markers
typical of questions in Mian: (a) they have their own distinctive intonational
contour, namely a level high pitch on the topic marker =le which is almost as
high as the H on the preceding vowel and (b) as a matter of convention, any
utterance of the structure NP=TOP is interpreted as a topic-only question.","[428, 429]"
"Content questionsIn content questions, the speaker requests information about some participant,
theme, location, time, manner, etc. of an event or action. The proposition of a
content question is presupposed apart from the queried constituent.
Content questions are formed with the interrogative clitic =e (=ne after
vowel). It encliticizes to the (clause-final) finite verb or the interrogative
phrase. Content questions are never marked by the interrogative particle m.
Apart from being flagged with the interrogative clitic =e, content questions
also involve one of the two basic question words or interrogative words fàb
‘where’ (18) or wan ‘who’ (19), which have further semantic extensions into
other epistemic domains (see below):
(18)fàb

‘Who’s broken this cup?’ [TMA questionnaire, 127]
Semantically, the two interrogative words almost exactly divide the world up
into animates (wan ‘who’), on the one hand, and inanimates and adverbials
(fàb ‘where, what’), on the other. The only exception to this rule is that wan
plus emphatic pronoun is employed to find out about people’s names, which
are not strictly animate but nonetheless important properties of people.",[416]

straightforward than it might appear in section 8.6.7, where I state that verb
forms like those in (23) are auxiliary-serialized forms consisting of a lexical
verb stem with any argument-indexing affixes followed by an auxiliary, e.g.:
(23)két=e

a-fû’-bi-n-e-so=be
3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ-HPST=DECL
‘I was holding the container yesterday.’For a description of the forms of the existential verb with the function of an
auxiliary, see section 8.6.7 for final verbs and section 11.2.5 for medial verbs.
Such verb-auxiliary sequences have the following properties:
-They are realized as a single phonological word, but there is no fusion
of the verbs and the auxiliary stem.
Aspect of the main verb and the auxiliary can be at variance.",[442]
"The interrogative word wantl-Ø-eb-bu=e?
come.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ-GPST=CQThe interrogative word wan ‘who’ is used to inquire about the identity of
animates including their names.
There are four variants wan, un and wal, ul. The variation between /wa/
and /u/ is free and can be found in other areas of Mian grammar, e.g. in the
variation of the object agreement prefix wa- ~ u- (see 8.5.3). The variants wal
and ul have the morphophonemic variants wale and ule if the following
emphatic pronoun start in /i/, there is. Thus, the forms for the second and third
person plural are walibta/ulibta ‘who (you PL)’ and walita/ulita ‘who
(they)’, respectively.
Without an emphatic pronoun, wan only occurs in questions about
possessors. Like possessors expressed by full noun phrases, the interrogative
word wan precedes the possessed. Either the pronominal article =e in the
singular masculine form (44) or =i in the animate plural form (45) is
obligatory:10.2. Content questions(44)lewan=e

compounded with an emphatic pronoun, such as ta ‘he (EMPH)’ (see 3.7.4).
The interrogative clitic =e is used to mark interrogative illocution. When =e
follows the pronoun suffix -ta, this suffix is realized as -t, as in (46) and (47):

subject. It is also possible to use wan to inquire about the object of a transitive
verb:40010. Question formation(50)wan-ta

The use of the classificatory prefix dl- ‘plural animate object’ in the last
example does not entail that the referent of the object is animate and plural.
Rather it is used as a default form in content questions about the object, i.e.
when the identity of the object referent is unknown and queried. For inquiring
about inanimate objects, see section 10.2.4 on fatnàmin ‘what’ above.
The combination wan ‘who’ plus emphatic pronoun is used in a non-verbal
construction to inquire about proper names, which are important properties of
humans and some animals. Example (53) is the idiomatic way of inquiring
about a man’s name. To ask about a woman’s name wanbte has to be used.

means ‘which’:10.2. Content questions(54)naka=i

There is one case where the interrogative phrase seemingly does not appear in
situ. Consider the two semantically more or less equivalent utterances. In both
(55) and (56), the speaker wants to know who broke the cup (|| indicates an
intonational break):

head-internal relative clause in topic position, namely kàb=e klutâ-n-e =le

utterance, fatnàmin is interpreted as ‘what’, ‘why’, or ‘how’. Unlike a
question with bare fàb, a question with fatnàmin can optionally be marked
with the content question clitic =e:
(33)fatnàmin?/ fatnàmin=e?",[422]
"Non-verbal clausesNon-verbal clauses are topic-comment constructions consisting of a non-finite
predicate (the comment) and exactly one argument (the topic). The predicate
is followed by the predicator =o. The topic is non-obligatory and thus can be
left out if its identity is obvious or retrievable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context. Non-verbal predicates always are one-place predicates and
can consist of a pronoun or noun (including proper names and verbal nouns),
an adjective, or an adverb.
Like clauses with finite verbs, non-verbal clauses are marked for
illocutionary force. The range of illocutionary markers, however, is slightly
more restricted since non-verbal predications cannot be hortatives. One finds
=be ‘Declarative’, =bo ‘Emphatic/quotative’, =ble ‘Exclamative’, =a
‘Question’ and =e ‘(Content) Question’. For interrogatory non-verbal
predications, see 10.1.1.
An example of a declarative non-verbal predication is:
(118) Iliba=e
tíl=o=be
PN=SG.M
dog=PRD=DECL
‘Iliba is a dog.’
Any noun phrase is permitted as the topic argument. This noun phrase can
consist of a free or inflected pronoun or a headless adjective. If the identity of
the referent of the topic noun phrase is obvious it is commonly left out:
(119) tíl=o=be
dog=PRD=DECL
‘It’s a dog.’
The reader should note that the pronoun ‘it’ in the free translation is not meant
to be taken as referential. ‘It’ does not refer to any entity which happens to be
a dog. Nothing in the Mian utterance tíl=o=be actually refers to the entity
about which the predication is made.
There is no predicator in questions:3729. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause(120) tíl=a?
dog=Q
‘Is it a dog?’
If the predicate term ends in a vowel the predicator =o is usually left out, even
in non-interrogatory contexts. However, occasionally =o is put in even under
these circumstances. Compare more frequent (121) and less frequent (122)
with the same meaning:
(121) naka=be
man=DECL
‘It is a man.’
(122) naka=o=be
man=PRD=DECL
‘It is a man.’9.11.1.","[397, 398]"
"3.11.2.bleka ‘or’The conjunction bleka ‘or’ is used to coordinate maximally two noun phrases,
as in (172), or clauses (173). In the latter case, the verb of the first clause
appears without an illocutionary clitic:

Coordination of three or more alternatives is unattested. On bleka ‘or’ in polar
questions, see section 10.1.2.",[176]
"231Focused noun phrases“[F]ocus is the most important or salient piece of information in the utterance,
as perceived by the speaker. [...] The focus [...] always presents new
information, though new relative to the topic, not necessarily new in the
discourse” (Siewierska 2004: 159).
Focus in Mian is marked by using an emphatic pronoun, etc., i.e. a bound
pronominal form suffixed with the emphatic pronoun suffix -ta (see 3.7.4)
Marking of focus is characteristic of Papuan languages in general, contrary to
fixed positional encoding in European languages, where focus is associated
with clause-final position (Foley 2000: 387-8).
Contrastive focus in Mian is generally expressed by using emphatic
pronouns. Two examples are given below:
(100) 

‘the husband went to sit down at pig fruits (to ambush pigs), the wife
took the mother and ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]
Focus marking with the emphatic pronoun is obligatory in alternative
questions (see 10.1.3). When there is a choice between two alternatives, each2326. The noun phraseexpressed by a noun phrase, both are in contrastive focus and emphatic
pronouns have to be used, as in the following example:
(102) kbo

or-ta
SG.M-EMPHaning
fishdowôn’-aamab-eb=a?
eat-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=Q
‘Do you want to eat pork or fish?’
On completive focus in content questions with wan ‘who’, see 10.2.7.
Focus marking is used in comparisons. I recorded example (103) as the
Mian translation of the English sentence “Port Moresby is bigger that
Vanimo” (|| indicates an intonational break):
(103) Mosbi
PN=le
SG.N2=TOP|| sm
bigeka
andBanimo
PN-ta
SG.N2-EMPHgwáab=o=be
small=PRD=DECL
‘(As for) Port Moresby (, it) is big, and Vanimo is small.’
This example consists of a topical noun phrase ‘Port Moresby’, set off
intonationally from the rest of the utterance, and a comment which actually
predicates something about this topic. The comparative element is focused
with -ta, but the statement, which prima facie seems to be about Vanimo, is in
effect a statement about the topic Port Moresby.","[257, 258]"
"Vowel clustersMian has a plethora of different vowel clusters, most of which appear ‘postmorphologically’ due to morpheme concatenation. Like vowel clusters are not
permitted. In some cases, like vowels are fused into a single vowel of normal
length, sometimes allomorphy is triggered.
Unlike the diphthongs, which are only rising, vowel clusters can be
centring. Vowel clusters which result from morpheme concatenation are
always heterosyllabic in careful speech. Table 2.7 sets out all permissible
heterosyllabic vowel clusters. Cells marked with an asterisk are not
permissible. In two cases allomorphy is triggered (see below).
A few selected examples are given below. The vowel clusters appear in
boldface:

sequences, e.g. the subject suffixes which begin in /i/, these are -i ‘first
singular subject’ and -ib(o) ‘second/third person plural animate subject’, are
realized as -ei and -eib(o), respectively, if they attach to a stem ending in a
high vowel, such as ki ‘align, read’ or fu ‘cook’. Thus, kieibiobe ‘I read’ and
fueibbiobe ‘you(PL)/they cooked’. Similarly, the animate plural article =i is
realized as =ei after /i/ or /u/, e.g. /Hsnabi/ ‘crocodile’ and /Hsnabi=i/ ‘(the)
crocodiles’; /Lumasou/ ‘fish species’ and /umasou=i/ ‘(the) umasou fish’.
In fast(er) speech, high and mid vowels as first members of vowel clusters,
that is all vowels except /a/ and /a/, lose their syllabicity and become glides.

"2.4. Pharyngealization35Given these problems, the analysis presented in this grammar follows the
one in Fedden (2007a) in not assuming a phonemic length contrast, leaving
the question whether Mian has a phonemic length distinction in its vowels for
future research on the language’s phonetics and phonology.","[60, 61]"
"Illocutionary force clitics157These are clitics which mark a non-verbal clause or a sentence (i.e. a single
independent sentence or whole clause chain) for illocutionary force. The
inventory comprises:
(195) =be
=bo
=ble
=a
=e
=o
=e‘Declarative’
‘Emphatic, quotative’
‘Exclamative’
‘Question’
‘(Content) Question’
‘Hortative (first person singular and plural, third person
singular)’
‘Hortative (second person singular, second/third person
plural)’All illocutionary clitics are discussed in 12.1. The interrogative clitics =e and
=a receive treatment under question formation in chapter 10. The hortative
clitics are described in 8.6.8.
The illocutionary clitic =bo ‘Emphatic, quotative’ has three different
functions in Mian. First, it is used to mark embedded quotatives (see 13.1).
Second, while =be just signals that an utterance is declarative, =bo can be used
to make a statement more emphatic, especially under negation, as in (196):
(196) nái=o
vagina=SG.Ffiamî=e
arrow_type=SG.N1toli=e

pierce.PFV-SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
‘they pierced her vagina on a Fiami arrow – not a Fiami arrow – a
Toli arrow, and then …’ [Initiation ritual]
Third, =bo is used in clause chains to indicate that the event described in the
following clause comes as a surprise. In this function it only occurs following
a medial verb form of the intransitive verb têm’/temê’ ‘have a look’, for
example:1583. Word classes and grammatical relations(197) daak-n-o=a

"The negative clitic =moThe negative clitic =mo is used in clauses that are negated with =ba ‘negation’
and prohibitives (see 8.6.7.6). It cannot be used in negated non-verbal
predications. =Mo typically encliticizes to the final constituent before the
verb. It can occur as a free word clause-initially. Examples of =mo in
declaratives can be found in 3.13.3 above. An example of the prohibitive is
given in (201):

If the negated verb consists of a coverb and a function verb in case of a
function-verb construction, =mo attaches to the final constituent before the
whole predicate, which includes the coverb accompanying a function verb. An
example is:1603. Word classes and grammatical relations(202) n

"10. Question formationfatnà- ‘do what?’This is an interrogative pro-verb (Hagège 2008) consisting of the interrogative
word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’. Fatnà ‘do what?’ can be inflected as a
verb and has the meaning ‘do what’:
(27)fatnà-b-eb=e?
do_what-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=CQ
‘What are you doing?’ [Observed]There is a case to be made that fatnà is best analysed as an interrogative proverb, i.e. as a single root which contains both a verbal and an interrogative
meaning. Such interrogative pro-verbs can be found in Papuan languages, e.g.
Kuot (Lindström 2002), Austronesian languages, e.g. Paamese (Crowley
1982) and Australian languages, e.g. Kayardild (Evans 1995: 371-372) and
Dyirbal (Dixon 1972). Outside the Pacific area, interrogative verbs can for
example be found in West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) (Sadock 1984: 206).
In Paamese, there is an intransitive monomorphemic interrogative verb
kosaa ‘do what’, which is not segmentable into an interrogative and a verbal
element (Crowley 1982: 159).
For Kayardild, Evans (1995: 371) analyses the pro-verb ngaakawatha ‘do
what’ as an inchoative form of the interrogative word ngaaka ‘what/who’.
Here, the pro-verb is derived from an interrogative word with the suffix
-watha which derives verbs from nominals (Evans 1995: 282).
The degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal element in
fatnà is relatively low. The interrogative word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’
can still clearly be discerned. /b/ goes to [t] before the alveolar nasal /n/. This
form of place assimilation applies across the board in Mian and is thus not
necessarily indicative of a beginning fusion between the interrogative and the
verb stem.
On the other hand, there is a semantic shift of the interrogative word fàb
from ‘where’ to ‘what’ in fatnà. Bare fàb cannot mean ‘what’, while fatnà
cannot mean ‘do where’. It contrasts with fàb na ‘do where’. As the meaning
of fàb is clearly construction-specific here, the meaning of fatnà cannot be
said to be fully transparent anymore. Also, the [t] in the interrogative verb
ftna is often elided in normal and fast speech to yield fanà ‘do what’. I
therefore analyse fatnà as an interrogative pro-verb, albeit one with a low
degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal part.
The core meaning of fatnà is ‘do what’:

do_what=MED
‘How has he escaped me?’ [Klebein]
(lit. ‘What has he done, has he gone on me?’)The last two examples also shed some light on the syntactic and
morphological behaviour of fatnà in content questions.
First, these forms function as verbs and are heads of their own clauses as
can be seen in (29), which consists of a medial clause  fatnànota and a final
clause besao mebone. This is captured in the literal translations above. Like
medial verbs, inflected fatnà is subject to the usual inflectional restrictions for
medial verbs, namely that they cannot be marked for polarity or for irrealis or
deontic mood.
Second, the bare stem fatnà can appear in shortened medial clauses under
subject identity as in (30). If the verb in the following clause has the same
subject, Mian medial verbs can be shortened to just the stem which is marked
as a medial verb by the clitic =ta (see 11.2.13).
Therefore, fatnà ‘do what’ is a morphologically and syntactically regular
verb in many respects. It can also form hortative verb forms (31) and appear in
purposive serializations (32):

"Minimal and near-minimal pairs for Mian vowelsWhat was pointed out in the section on minimal and near-minimal pairs for
consonants also applies to vowels: the importance for a pair to have the same
tone pattern on both words in order to be a genuine minimal pair. Pairs with
different tones are near-minimal pairs.

some near-minimal pairs which suggest that length might indeed be
contrastive, the question whether Mian has a phonemic length distinction in its
vowels is not a straightforward one to answer. The problematic status of
length in the vowel system is due to the fact that there are (so far) no minimal
pairs which differ in length while bearing the same tone and having the same
syllable structure and segmental context, whereas this is common in the
neighbouring language Telefol (Healey 1964b: 8-12).
It is not entirely clear whether Smith and Weston (1974a) actually include
a series of phonemically long vowels in their analysis. In their treatment of
Mian phonemes, they do not explicitly posit a phonemic length distinction but
speak of “lengthened” vowels instead, which carry two tones and are from 1½
to 2 times longer than “single” vowels (1974a: 6). All of these words show a
rising pitch contour. “Lengthened” vowels are analysed as a sequence of two
vowels which form two adjacent syllable nuclei (p. 14). This sounds as if there
is no phonemic length contrast involved. However, they give two (near-)
minimal pairs under the heading ‘Examples of Length Contrasts’ (p. 13).","[56, 57]"
"Illocutionary forceOnly final verbs can be marked for illocutionary force. The set of illocutionary
markers consists of the clitics =be ‘Declarative’, =ble ‘Exclamative’, =bo
‘Quotative, emphatic’, =a ‘Question’, =e ‘(Content) Question’, and =o ~ =e
‘Hortative’. All of these have scope over the whole clause chain, e.g.:
(1)
3SG.Mbín=o
floor=N2we-n-e=a
sweep-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MEDunín=o
fu-n-e=be
cook-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
food=N2
‘He swept the floor and then cooked food.’
In (1) the illocutionary particle =be marks the whole clause chain as
declarative. The first clause cannot be interpreted as having a different
illocutionary value, for instance, to construe it as a question: *‘Did he sweep
the floor?’ is impossible. Note though that the first clause on its own could
indeed be a question,2 provided it has the appropriate interrogative intonation:
(2)
bín=o
we-n-e=a?
floor=N2 sweep-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=Q
3SG.M
‘Has he swept the floor?’Nonetheless, in (1) above an interrogative reading of the first clause is
impossible due to the scope of the marker of declarative illocutionary force on
the final verb.
The same holds for the illocutionary markers =ble ‘Exclamative’ in (3),
and =bo ‘Quotative, emphatic’ in (4):

The illocutionary clitic =ble indicates that the whole of (3) is an exclamation
and =bo in (4) likewise expresses that all preceding medial clauses are
quotative, i.e. they represent what the woman said at that point in the story. On
quotatives as embedded structures, see 13.1.
Markers of interrogative and hortative illocutionary force obey the same
scope rules. In order to turn the wohle of (1) above into a question, one can
replace =be ‘Declarative’ with =a to indicate a polar question:
(5)

‘Has he swept the floor and cooked food?’
*‘He has swept the floor, and has he cooked food?’
The verb in the medial clauses which precedes the final verb funea? ‘Has he
cooked (it)?’ is not marked as a question itself, but the scope rules for the
interrogative illocutionary clitic =a force an interpretation of the entire clause
chain as interrogative.
In clause chains in which the final verb is marked as hortative by =e ~ =o,
scope is over the whole chain as well, e.g.:47412. Operator scope in clause chaining constructions(6)deb-êt-n-i=a

sitanano ‘I should care for’ are not marked as hortatives themselves, the scope
rules force an interpretation of all these verbs as hortative.
The illocutionary markers still have scope over the whole chain if the
subject reference changes. This is illustrated for hortative illocution in (7):

‘ “Your wife and children must come first and you must see them
then let’s leave them and go!” ’ [Crows]
The domain of all markers of illocutionary force is invariably the whole
sentence, which can either be a simple sentence or a clause chain.
Illocutionary markers never have scope over other sentences apart from the
one in which they occur. Sentence boundaries are indicated by brackets in (8):

‘ “Copulating (in) there, they beget children. You too have sex with
her!” he called out to him.’ [Pig story]
The embedded discourse in (8) consists of two independent sentences. The
first one is itself a clause chain whose final verb is marked as quotative by
=bo. The second one is a simple sentence with a hortative verb. Only this
second sentence can be interpreted as hortative because the scope of the
hortative marker =e does not have scope into or over the preceding quotative
sentence.","[498, 499, 500, 501]"
"The near past marker -nab ‘Near past’ is the only one of the pre-subject slot
fillers which is unattested in final verbs in a clause chaining construction. -Nab
only occurs in medial verbs where it indicates DS and event sequentiality with
a short interval between marked and reference clause events. It also occurs in
simple independent sentences with the meaning ‘Near past’.
This is possibly due to (accidental) homophony between =a ‘medial’ and =a
‘polar question’.",[609]

"Synopsis of pronounsThis is a synopsis of all pronominal forms in Mian. All of these can be used
pronominally and they can instantiate a noun phrase by themselves. Only the
forms of the third person plural are given in the synopsis, but cross-references
are provided in case the reader wants to look up the full pronominal
paradigms.
In the third person, all emphatic pronouns, the proximal demonstratives
and the emphatic distal demonstrative pronoun can also be used adnominally
in the rightmost position in the noun phrase.
The forms li and lita of the proximal demonstrative are only used
adnominally, the forms li and lita have both adnominal and pronominal
uses. All distal demonstratives co-occur with the clitic =obba, which follows
the noun, in their adnominal form.

(3.7.9)InterrogativesMian has two interrogative words: wan ‘who’ and fàb ‘where, what’.
Semantically, the two interrogative words divide the world up into animates
(wan ‘who’), on the one hand, and inanimates and adverbials (fàb ‘where,
what’), on the other. Interrogative words do not encode the categories number
and gender. They do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites. Both wan and fàb can be used pronominally and adnominally. For
details on the form and the use of wan and fàb, see section 10.2 on
interrogative words and the formation of content question.","[164, 165]"
"Noun phrase topicalizationTopic-marking in Mian is done with the topic clitic =le which attaches to
noun phrases, including free pronouns. I analyse =le as a clitic rather than an
affix because it not only attaches to pronouns but can mark topical adverbial
clauses and medial clauses in clause chains as well. Topical constituents with
=le are intonationally detached from the following clause.
Topic marking with =le is incompatible with emphatic pronouns, which
are used for focus (see 6.10), e.g. *-ta=le [3SG.M-EMPH=TOP].
Topic-only question are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is
mentioned. The speaker has a particular question in mind, and it must be
obvious from the context what the implied question is, such as I’m going. And
you? (Implied: Are you going as well?). Two examples are given below:
(94)kbo=le?
2SG.M=TOP
‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
‘What do you want to eat?’)(95)=le?
3SG.M=TOP
‘What about Milsen?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Milsen doing?’
‘Where is Milsen?’)
MandatPNTopic marking is commonly found in personal introductions (|| marks an
intonational break in all examples in this section):
(96)n=le
||
Dabein
n-ta=bo
PN
1SG-EMPH=QUOT
1SG=TOP
‘ “As for me, Dabein that’s me.” ’ [Dimosson]Subjects can be topicalized with =le, as in the following excerpts from an
account of traditional initiation, where the topic is given:2306. The noun phrase(97)[...] ‘Adults would line the side of the path. Others (also adults)
would lead the boys who are to be initiated, and they (i.e. the boys)
walked along the path ...’

ol-ò-n-ib=a
drums=N1.PL PL.RESID.O-take-SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
‘as for the ones on the side (i.e. the adults), they take drums and ...’
[Initiation rituals]
This bit of discourse contains two groups of adults, as opposed to the boys,
one group lining the path, the other leading the boys. The topic pronoun is
here used to establish the first group of adults as the topic of the new clause.
Topics are typically given information but this is not necessarily the case,
as in the following example where an object is topicalized which has not been
previously mentioned in the discourse:
(98)memé
children=le||PL.AN=TOPSobining=e
PN=SG.Mdl-êt-n-e=a
PL.AN.O-take-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
‘As for the children, Sobining took them and ...’ [Sobining]
Multiple topicalized constituents can often be found as discourse openers (de
Vries 2005). In the following example, the first topic yomin=o=le is a more
general topic of the whole narrative, set up here as a discourse frame by the
speaker:
(99)yomin=o=le
initiation=N2=TOP||yangpela=i=le

then ...’ [Initation rituals]6.10. Focused noun phrases6.10.","[255, 256, 257]"
"IntroductionGrammatically marked categories such as tense, mood, polarity, illocutionary
force and the like, called operators by Foley and Van Valin (1984) and Foley
and Olsen (1985), differ in the scope they have in clause chaining structures.
The final verb is usually marked for such categories whereas the medial verbs
in the same clause chain depend on some of this information. While medial
verbs encode sequentiality or simultaneity of events and switches in subject
reference, they rely on final verbs for information on temporal location, mood,
and illocutionary force of the events denoted by the medial verbs. This is
typical for co-subordinated structures, such as clause chains (Reesink 1983,
Foley and Van Valin 1984).
In this chapter, all operators that occur in final verbs in clause chaining
constructions and the scope they have over the clause chain will be examined
in some detail. The operators are ordered according to categories:
Illocutionary forcePolarity

Habituality=be

and habituality can have full scope but do not have to, and aspect finally is a
local phenomenon that never has scope.","[497, 498]"
"In the rest of this section on generic terms I discuss a few peculiarities of the
classificatory construction.
First, generic term and referential noun obligatorily or preferably occur in
reverse order in a few cases:
(64)taan wan

quantity and not quality or kind, younger speakers tend to use fatnàmin-fela

Inquiring about quantities was presumably not a common activity in a society

around six or seven. Larger quantities were designated as ‘many’. I assume
that the meaning ‘how many’ for fatnàmin developed as a secondary sense
from ‘what, what kind of’.","[422, 423]"
"13. EmbeddingRelative clausesRelative clauses in Mian serve the function that many scholars have identified
for relative clauses in all languages, namely to delimit the potential reference
of a noun (e.g. Comrie 1981: 136). More specifically, a relative relation
involves two events (or states of affairs), a main and a dependent one, which
share exactly one participant. “[A] participant of the main SoA [State of
Affairs – SF] is identified within a set of possible referents by mentioning
some other SoA in which he or she takes part” (Cristofaro 2003: 195).
Mian relative clauses are finite and can be either prenominal or headinternal. There is no formal distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive
relative clauses. As the function of the latter ones is not to delimit potential
reference of a noun but rather to give additional information pertaining to the
referent in question, they are not covered by Comrie’s (1981) definition.
Nevertheless, this section also includes some examples of relative clauses
which are clearly of the non-restrictive type in English. In Mian the restrictive
vs. non-restrictive distinction is not formally expressed.",[526]
"Yet, despite the considerable degree of similarity between medial and final
verbs, there are principled differences between the two. Medial verbs can
neither be marked for irrealis or deontic mood nor for negative polarity. Nor
can they be inflected for hortative mood. Furthermore, medial and final verbs
do not co-occur with the same set of clitics. While the latter co-occur with
clitics indicative of illocutionary force, such as =be ‘Declarative’ and =e
‘(Content) question’, the former usually only co-occur with the medial verb
marker =a. This marker is presumably derived from the co-ordinator =a ‘and’
which is used to coordinate noun phrases, e.g. tn=a unáng=a=i
[child=and woman=and=PL.AN] ‘(the) children and women’, and which in
turn is a shortened form of eka ‘and’.
As noted above, morphological markers indicating co- or disjoint subject
reference are a common feature of medial verbs in clause chaining
constructions. Medial verbs carry a marker (which may be zero), whose main
function is to indicate whether the subject of the verb in the following clause
has the same subject or a different one, but which also incorporates other
meanings, mainly temporal and aspectual ones, such as sequentiality (SEQ)
and simultaneity (SIM) of events described by the two consecutive clauses
(Stirling 1993, Roberts 1997). The following sections deal with S/R
morphology of medial verbs in Mian.",[450]
"109Function verbsThere are two function (or ‘light’) verbs: ge/ga~gena ‘say’ and ke ‘do’, which
combine with a coverb in a complex predication. The coverbs of the former
are ideophones (e.g. fong ‘whistle’), while the latter typically occurs with a
noun (e.g. tekein ‘knowledge’), but serves a wider range of functions (see
below). Ge/ga~gena ‘say’ is also used in quotatives and embedded questions
(see 13.1). Complex predicates involving function verbs will be discussed in
detail in section 8.9.
Two examples follow:
(58)fong
ge-s-e=a
whistle

do-SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
‘Many man and women knew (of it), and ...’ [Sofelok, 2]
The function verb ke ‘do’ has a range of other functions, which I only mention
in passing here. A more detailed description can be found in 8.9.2. The
function verb ke ‘do’:
--can follow an adverb, e.g. heb ke [fast do] ‘hurry’.
productively takes Tok Pisin noun and verb loans as coverbs to form
new (complex) verbs, e.g. kot ke [court do] ‘stand trial’, sakim ke [suck
do] ‘suck’.
can follow any of the basic numerals asú ‘two’, asusûna ‘two’, and
asumâtna ‘three’ to express that a group consists of a certain number
of individuals, e.g. asumâtna ke [three do] ‘be three of’.",[135]
"Medial verbs in utterance-final positionIt is quite a common phenomenon for Mian medial verbs to appear utterancefinally in natural discourse. However, such utterances are usually not taken to
be grammatically complete sentences (Reesink 1987: 87). Their verbs are
clearly medial and not final because they are not interpreted with respect to
the moment of speaking (as final verbs are) but rather with respect to some
subsequent event which is not mentioned but implied or understood, since it is
obvious to the addressee from the context established by the situation in which
the utterance was made (Reesink 1983: 225).
Although clause chains do not involve subordination (in the sense of
embedding) but rather co-subordination, the phenomenon under discussion
here is comparable to the widespread use of subordinate constructions as main
clauses in the world’s languages with particular semantic or discourse effects
(Evans 2007).
Note that medial verbs in utterance-final position always take the medial
verb marker =ta rather than =a. An example is provided in (124):
sít=o
fubâ-n-i=ta
(124) n
tooth=PL.N1 wash-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
1SG
‘I’ll brush my teeth first and then I’ll …’ [Observed]
Medial clauses as independent utterances are invariably understood as
desiderative statements about the future. Examples like (124) are abbreviated46811. Chaining constructionsversions of a full clause chain ending in a final verb inflected for irrealis. A
possible example is (125):
(125) n
1SGsít=o

wash-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MEDáam
un-aamab-i=be
lie.SG.SBJ go.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
‘I’ll brush my teeth and then go to bed.’
A clause with a medial verb in final position, such as n sít=o fubâ-n-i=ta in
(124) above cannot be construed to mean: *‘I have brushed my teeth’, for
which an independent sentence has to be employed, as in (126):
(126) n
sít=o
fubâ-Ø-i-o=be
tooth=PL.N1
wash-REAL-1SG.SBJ-EP=DECL
1SG
‘I’ve brushed my teeth.’
In (126), the final verb fubâiobe ‘I’ve washed (it)’ is zero-marked for realis
mood. As there is no alternative temporal reference point indicated, the default
interpretation is that the action took place immediately before the moment of
speaking.
Another reason why utterance-final verbs in examples such as (124) above
should be treated as medial and not as final verbs is that the markers in the
pre-subject slot are interpreted as S/R markers. The S/R system limits the set
of available subjects for the implied event. For instance, the medial verb in
(124) fubânita is inflected with -n ‘SS.SEQ’. As the subject is first person
singular, the subject of the implied event must be coreferential. In all other
person-number combinations, -n only indicates sequentiality of events (127):
(127) funa-n-eb=ta
think.PFV-SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED
‘You think first and then (anybody)…’
In the next example the medial verb is marked for DS. Consequently, the
subject of the implied event must be disjoint (regardless of person and number
specification of the subject):
(128) aai=e
dowôn’-s-eb=ta
eat.PFV-DS.SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED
water=SG.N1
‘You’ll drink water first and then someone else will…’11.6. Non-verbal clauses in clause chains469It is possible for utterance-final medial verbs to also take one of the
illocutionary particles =be ‘Declarative’, =bo ‘Emphatic/quotative’, =ble
‘Exclamative’, =a ‘Question’, or =e ‘(Content) Question’ (which normally
only occur on final verbs) in addition to the medial verb clitic =ta. Again,
such structures are not grammatically complete utterances but imply an event
which must be readily retrievable from the linguistic or extra-linguistic
context. Examples (129) and (130) illustrate this for a declarative and an
interrogative sentence, respectively:
(129) fanin-wal=i
ancestor-PL=PL.ANwengsâng
storybaa-n-ang-ge-n-i=ta=be

‘Will you brush your teeth first?’ (Implied, e.g. ‘and then go to bed’)11.6.","[493, 494, 495]"
"Use of F-class singular om- for broken and half objectsFor inanimate referents which are broken, the prefix om- is always possible as
an alternative to the bundle, covering, long, and residue class prefixes:

the objects in question are indeed broken and thus not treated as individual
items anymore but more like a heap or a mass.
The prefix om- is also employed for halves of formerly whole objects.

semantic features ‘broken mass’ or ‘half’ are not expressed in the noun but lie
exclusively in the classificatory prefix.","[226, 227]"
"Scope of habitual markingIf a final verb is marked for habituality by -bina or if the final verb is the
habitual form of the existential verb bina ‘stay habitually’ all events in the

clearly outside of any habituality scope because it describes a unique action of
the man who cared for the plant which later produced a certain fruit. These

Embedding13.0.","[509, 510, 511]"
"IntroductionMian has four types of embedded structure. These are:
-quotative sentences
adverbial clauses
head-internal relative clauses
prenominal relative clausesThese four structures can be distinguished with respect to their syntactic
category and the structures into which they are embedded.
Quotatives are full sentences, i.e. they receive marking for illocutionary
force, e.g. =bo for quotatives, =a for embedded polar questions, =e for
embedded content questions, or =e ~ =o ‘hortative’. These are always
embedded as sentential complements of the function verb ge/ga ‘say’.
Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses display clausal syntax
but are formally marked as noun phrases, i.e. they occur with a proper subset
of the determiners which fill the determiner slot in ordinary noun phrases. It is
quite typical for Papuan languages to treat adverbials and relatives formally
the same, the functional reason for this being that both types of clause provide
background information (Foley 1986: 202).
Prenominal relative clauses are embedded within noun phrases. They do
not receive any overt marking. There is no subordinator, determiner and no
illocutionary marking.
Embedded structures are on a different syntactic level with respect to their
matrix clauses because in complex sentences, embedded clauses are skipped
by the switch reference (S/R) morphology operating in the main clause, i.e.
S/R is calculated with respect to the next clause after the embedded structure.
Verbs in simple embedded clauses are morphologically very similar to
independent sentence-final verbs, e.g. both the former and the latter can be
inflected for irrealis mood whereas medial verbs cannot. All embedded
structures can be complex themselves. They can consist of a clause chain
themselves. In such cases, the last clause has a final verb and all clauses in the
embedded chain have medial verbs with S/R morphology pertaining only to
subject tracking and to the temporal structure of the events in the embedded
clause chain. In other words, S/R morphology only tracks subjects across48613. Embeddingclauses on the same syntactic level. Subject-tracking never reaches into
embedded clauses or out of embedded clauses into the matrix clause.
Verbs in embedded quotatives are always fully independent of any
information marked on the final verb in the matrix clause. Verbs in embedded
adverbials and relative clauses are only minimally dependent on the matrix
verb in that it always has to have the same illocutionary force value. This
dependency is familiar from clause chains. Unlike medial clauses, however,
verbs in embedded adverbial and relative clauses have their own TAM value
and are independent of any negation on the matrix verb, as shown in (1).
Adverbial clauses are “impervious to denial from such following clauses”
(Haiman 1980: 142), e.g.:
(1)bomânomo

‘If tomorrow the airstrip accumulates water, the plane won’t come.’

cats cannot be interpreted as habitual in (2):

"The interrogative word fàbThe interrogative word fàb occurs in five different construction types.
Depending on the construction, the semantics of fàb vary:39210. Question formation(1) Bare fàb means ‘where’.
(2) The interrogative verb fatnà has the meaning ‘do what, do why, do how’.
It probably consists of the interrogative word fàb and a finite verb form of na
‘do’. Morphologically and syntactically, this compound be-haves like a finite
verb.
(3) The compound fatnàmin (< fàb-namin) on its own, i.e. fàb plus the
imperfective verbal noun na-m-in [do-IPFV-VN] ‘(activity of) doing’, covers a
semantic area which in English is divided up into ‘what, why, how, how
much/many, which, what kind of’.
(4) Fatnàmin can be suffixed with either of three derivational suffixes,
instrumental -dum ‘with’, causal -dofa ‘about’, or purposive -deib ‘for’,
yielding the interrogative phrases fatnàmin-dum ‘with what’ asking for the
instrument, fatnàmin-dofa ‘about what’, asking for the reason, or
fatnàmin-deib ‘what for’, asking for the purpose of an action.
(5) Fatnàmin can function as the complement of the nominal postposition dim
‘on’. The resulting interrogative phrase fatnàmin dim ta ‘when’ is used for
enquiring about a point in time.
Table 10.1 lists all interrogative expressions based on fàb, their basic meaning
and their semantic extensions.

"Verb serialization versus compounding (synopsis)In this section I outline the main differences between verb serialization and
V-V compounds and give a synopsis of these differences. For more on V-V
compounds, see 3.2.2. V-V compounds are similar to nuclear SVCs. They are
restricted to two verb stems, they do not allow separate objects and they do
not allow aspect to be at variance. However, a V-V compound is always
realized as a single phonological word. It constitutes a single domain for tone
assignment, whereas the verbs in nuclear SVCs are phonologically
independent, constituting two separate tonal domains. Furthermore, the stems
in V-V compounds can show some degree of fusion of the verb stems. So
while nuclear SVCs are only grammatical but not phonological units, V-V
compounds are both grammatical and phonological units. See Crowley (1987:
59-61) for a similar argument for the distinction of nuclear SVCs and
compounds in Paamese.
An example of a Mian V-V compound is given in (20):
(20)no=i
marsupials=PL.AN
ya-l-êt-n-e=ta
PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-take.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
‘he killed and took the marsupials and then he…’ [Crows]The compound is ya-l-êt ‘kill and take them’. Semantically, these describe
discrete events, a ‘killing’-event and a ‘taking’-event. The two serialized verb
stems are -lò ‘kill (PFV)’ and -êb ~ -êt ‘take in order to carry (PFV)’, which
share the same aspectual value ‘perfective’ and the same object, i.e. no=i ‘the
marsupials’. The sequence of verbs is realized as a single phonological word
and shows fusion due to the deletion of /o/ (-lò ‘kill’ > l). The HL tonal
melody on -lò ‘kill’ is deleted before a verb with a LHL melody and the LHL
melody of -êb ‘take in order to carry (PFV)’ applies to the entire verb in (20).
The first stem -lò ‘hit, kill (PFV)’ cross-references the object of the whole
sequence noi ‘the marsupials’ with the object prefix ya-, while the second
stem -êb drops its classificatory prefix under argument identity. Outside of
nuclear serializations the verb -êb ‘take in order to carry (PFV)’ obligatorily
occurs with a classificatory object prefix, as in (21):11.1. Serial verb constructions(21)éil

[Kasak]For a detailed description of this construction, see 8.5.5. Phonologically,
sequences of verb plus -ûb- ‘give (PFV)’ are most similar to V-V compounds.
They are single phonological words. The stems even show fusion since -ûb’‘give (PFV)’ is generally realized as just -ˆb’- after any vowel (with a few
exceptions all of which end in /a/). Furthermore, the classificatory prefix on41611. Chaining constructions‘give (PFV)’ is gapped. This only happens in V-V compounds, never in core or
nuclear SVCs.
Table 11.3 below is a synopsis of the distinguishing properties of core
SVCs, nuclear SVCs, and V-V compounds. Properties are grouped as
phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic.

"3. Word classes and grammatical relationsDemonstrativesDemonstratives exist for the third person and come in a proximal and a distal
variety. The forms of both demonstrative series are given in table 3.15 below.
The form li of the proximal demonstrative is only used adnominally, the form
li has both adnominal and pronominal uses.
There are two series of proximal demonstratives, a simple one (130) and an
emphatic one (131).

DEM.PROX.SG.M-EMPHThe proximal demonstrative agrees in number and gender with the noun it
follows. It is employed when the object in question is close to the speaker. The
form le is also used as a spatial adverb meaning ‘here’ and the form lo is
also used as a temporal adverb meaning ‘now’. The distal series is used when
the object is remote from the speaker. The form y (and y) is also used as a
spatial adverb meaning ‘there’.
Apart from the adnominal use illustrated in (130) and (131), the proximal
demonstrative can also be used pronominally using the same forms. In its
pronominal use the demonstrative constitutes a noun phrase of its own, as in
(132):
(132) le
DEM.PROX.SG.Mmn=e
child=SG.Mdob-miki-n-e=a
3SG.M_CL.O-take_into_arms.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
‘this (one) took the boy into his arms and then he…’ [Crows]3.7. Pronouns137The pronunciation of the proximal demonstrative (133) differs from the article
followed by the topic clitic (134):
(133) mn
le
DEM.PROX.SG.M
child
‘this boy’
(134) mn
=le
SG.M=TOP
child
‘as for the boy’
The form in (133) is pronounced [ l ] because of high-tone spreading. The
form in (134), however, is pronounced [ l] because the topic clitic bears a
low tone, which prevents tone spreading from the left. In all other cases this
issue does not arise because the two forms in question are not segmentally
identical (in addition to the tonal difference illustrated for (133) and (134)
above):
(135) unáng
lo
DEM.PROX.SG.F
woman
‘this woman’
(136) unáng
=le
SG.F=TOP
woman
‘as for the woman’
The distal demonstrative series formally distinguishes between an adnominal
and a pronominal series. The former always involves the clitic element =obba,
followed by the distal demonstrative.
As in the proximal series, distal demonstratives always follow the noun and
reflect number and gender:

with inanimates.

The position of demonstratives within the noun phrase is discussed further in

restrictive meaning and can be used pronominally (140) or adnominally (141):

"Fatnàmin with derivational suffixesThe interrogative word fatnàmin can be suffixed with either of three
derivational suffixes, instrumental -dum ‘with’, causal -dofa ‘about’, or
purposive -deib ‘for’, resulting in the interrogative phrases fatnàmin-dum
‘with what’, fatnàmin-dofa ‘about what, why’, and fatnàmin-deib ‘for what’.

"2166. The noun phraseConstituent order in relative clauses is no different from the order in
independent clauses, with one noteworthy exception where the internal head
of a relative clause shows some mobility unattested in simple declarative
sentences (see 13.3.7). Verbs in relative clauses show all inflectional
possibilities of a (sentence-final) verb in an independent sentence in terms of
tense, aspect, mood, and argument marking. For example, they can be
inflected for irrealis or deontic mood, which medial verbs cannot.
Head-internal relative clauses are much more frequent than prenominal
ones in natural discourse. Nearly all examples of prenominal relative clauses
are elicited. However, in most cases the prenominal variant of a head-internal
relative clause was offered immediately by the speaker without any further
question as to whether a prenominal relative construction was also possible.","[241, 242]"
"Nuclear serial verb constructionsNuclear SVCs have a more tightly-knit structure than core SVCs. They consist
of maximally two stems. No material can intervene between the two stems of
a nuclear SVC but the component verbs are realized as phonologically
independent words and each verb constitutes its own domain with respect to
tone assignment.
While core SVCs allow the component verbs to have their own objects this
is not permitted in nuclear SVCs. If the whole SVC is transitive it has a single
object. The stem aspect value of the component verbs must not be at variance.
While it is possible for either stem to be trans-aspectual, it is impossible that
one is perfective and the other imperfective. In many cases the constituent
stems of a nuclear SVC do not occur on their own and they are therefore
difficult to gloss. I therefore gloss nuclear SVCs as a whole.
An example of a nuclear SVC is given in (18):

‘as for the Aalei fathersk, theyl included themk too’ [Mian. and Tele.]11.1. Serial verb constructions413Typically, nuclear SVCs are not semantically compositional. A list of example
nuclear SVCs is provided in table 11.1. Verbs which only occur in a nuclear
SVC and whose meaning is therefore difficult to give, are glossed with a
question mark. When the gloss of a component verb is doubtful it is preceded
by a question mark.

one object, the latter do not have an object. Most of the example nuclear SVCs
in table 11.1 are transitive. Intransitive nuclear SVCs are naa tl ‘come back,
return’, naa temê’ ‘try’, and -ò blelâ’ ‘fall’.
In a nuclear SVC, the second verb does not gap its object prefix. In (19),
baa ‘say (PFV)’ and -fâ ‘put (PFV)’ share the object, which can only be wéng
‘talk’, and the object is indexed by the classificatory prefix om- on the second
member of the nuclear SVC because this is a lexical requirement of -fâ ‘put
(PFV)’. This distinguishes nuclear SVC from verb compounds, where any
prefixes on the second member of the compound need to be gapped (see 3.2.2
on V-V compounds).

"3008. Verb morphologyTable 8.14 sets out stem contrasts and inflectional possibilities for the
existential verb.
There are several noteworthy features about TAM inflection in the
existential verb.
First, -n ‘Realis’ contrasts with -Ø ‘Imperfective’, while in all other
directly inflected verbs -n and -Ø are allomorphs with the meaning ‘Realis’.
Thus, there are both (156) and (157):
Table 8.14. Stem contrasts and inflection of the existential verb n/bi~bl
Stem

bi~bl (Imperfective stem)
-Ø ‘Imperfective’
-n ‘Realis’

biaaH (Non-hodiernal past stem)
-b(H) ‘Non-hodiernal past’7
-Vm ‘Deontic’
n (Perfective stem)
-aamab/ -omab ‘Irrealis’
bina (Habitual stem)
-b ‘Imperfective’
biaana (Past habitual stem)(156) a-fû’-n-e=be

‘He has grabbed it.’
(157) a-fû’-Ø-e=be
3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘He has grabbed it.’
This allomorphy is not found in the existential verb. Elision of -n in forms of
the existential verb creates a semantic contrast. Compare (158) and (159):
(158) bi-n-e=be
stay.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘He has been staying (up to now).’
(159) bi-Ø-e=be
stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘He is staying.’
The second noteworthy feature about the existential verb is that it has three
additional stems apart from the perfective stem n- and the imperfective stems8.6. TAM morphology of final verbsbi~bl-: biaaH ‘stay (Non-hodiernal past)’, example (160), bina
(Habitual)’, example (161), and biaana ‘stay (Past habitual)’.301
‘stay(160) biaaH-b(H)-i=be
stay.NHODPST-NHODPST-1SG.SBJ=DECL
‘I was staying (but not today).’
(161) bina-b-o=be
stay.HAB-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
‘She stays habitually.’
Third, irrealis mood in the imperfective is formed with -aamab, if the subject
is not animate plural. If it is, -omab is used:
(162) bi-aamab-i=be
stay.IPFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
‘I will be staying.’
(163) bi-omab-io=be
stay.IPFV-IRR.PL.AN.SBJ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
‘You (PL)/they will be staying.’
The existential verb shows two contracted forms. When either of the forms
bi-Ø-e [stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ] ‘he stays’ or bi-Ø-o [stay.IPFV-IPFV3SG.F.SBJ] ‘she stays’ are followed by =a ‘Question’ the disallowed vowel
clusters *[mbia] and *[mbioa] are simplified to [mbia] and [mbua], respectively.
Apart from these differences, TAM inflection of the existential verb
proceeds in much the same way as in other directly inflected verbs. The
perfective stem n is used in irrealis forms in the perfective (164) and (165) and
in deontic forms (166):
(164) n-amab-i=be
stay.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
‘I will stay.’
(165) n-omab-io=be
stay.PFV-IRR.PL.AN.SBJ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
‘You/they will stay.’
(166) n-im-i=be
stay.PFV-DEONT-1SG.SBJ=DECL
‘I should stay.’3028. Verb morphologyForms which are only marked -n ‘Realis’ are by default interpreted as
referring to events having taken place immediately before the moment of
speaking and appear interspersed in texts about the far and remote past.
(167) bi-n-o=be
stay.IPFV-REAL-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
‘She has been staying (up to now)/was staying.’
For realis forms, further temporal specification is possible by suffixing -so
‘Hesternal past’ or -bio ‘General past’:
(168) bi-n-i-so=be
stay.IPFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-HPST=DECL
‘I was staying yesterday.’
(169) bi-n-i-bio=be
stay.IPFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=DECL
‘I was staying.’8.6.6.","[325, 326, 327, 328]"
"2.1.1.4. The lateral glide /l/
The lateral glide /l/ is the most complex phoneme in terms of its allophonic
variation. In native words, it is realized by all speakers as the voiced, prenasalized, alveolar stop [d] word-initially. Phonetic [l] occurs word-initially
only in a few Tok Pisin loans, e.g. lotu [lotu] ‘church’, lais [lais] ‘rice’, and
ledio [ldio] ‘radio’.
As far as the question whether this phoneme should be analysed as /l/ or /d/
is concerned, I opt for /l/ because, given that /b/ is devoiced syllable-finally,
we would expect that devoicing also applies to a syllable-final /d/-phoneme,
but syllable-final /l/ is always realized as either [l] or [], never as [t].
/l/ is only pronounced [d] word-internally if the preceding syllable ends in
a consonant. Compare:
(1)
BUTáandal
dingdang
elàak/LHa n-lal/
/Llila/
/HL-la k/[a ndl]
[dida]
[ là kh]‘river bank’
‘thin’
‘down here’That /l/ is not pronounced [d] or [d] word-medially between vowels, even
though in syllable-initial position, can be seen from the example /LHtil=o=Lb/
[thi.l. ], *[thi.d. ] ‘it’s a dog’.
Apart from these fixed rules, pronunciation of /l/ varies considerably
between speakers. Generally, /l/ can be realized as [l] in all other positions
apart from word-initial and word-medial position following a consonant.
Some speakers pronounce /l/ as [l] only syllable-finally, but as an alveolar trill
[r] between /t/ and a vowel in the syllable-initial cluster /tl/, and as an alveolar
flap [ ] in all other contexts, e.g. as second member of the syllable-initial
consonant clusters /bl, kl, l, sl, fl/ and between vowels.
Some speakers do not have [l] at all. They pronounce /l/ as [ ] in all
positions with a certain tendency to have [r] in the syllable-initial cluster /tl/.",[48]

"8.6.7.2. Habitual forms
Verbs inflected with -b ‘Imperfective’ can have a (present) habitual
interpretation apart from the more basic continuous meaning (see 8.6.1.4).
However, there is also a dedicated habitual construction involving the
auxiliary habitual stem of the existential verb bina. As one would expect, the
habitual auxiliary cannot be collocated with perfective stems. Habitual verb
forms are always further suffixed by -b ‘Imperfective’.

3SG.M.O-see.IPFV-AUX.HAB-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
‘Yes, I see him all the time.’ [TMA Questionnaire, 40]
Habitual verb form with bina are often collocated with the adverbs sún(ye)
‘habitually’ and amít(ye) ‘always’.
The past habitual is formed by serializing biaana with an imperfective
stem. Again, there is obligatory further suffixation of the imperfective aspect
suffix -b:
(181) naka=i

gwi-ye-biaana-b-io=be

‘They used to use poison magic on people (but not anymore).’
[Dafinau]8.6.7.3. Auxiliary-serialization with perfective stems
Some perfective stems can be serialized with an imperfective auxiliary in
order to express that the result of the action denoted by the perfective stem is
continuing after the execution of the action. Consider the perfective-only verb
stem -fû’/— ‘grab’. In (182), the result of a punctual action is described. In
(183), the focus is on the continuation of the result of the action of grabbing,
i.e. holding:
(182) a-fû’-n-e=be
3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘He has grabbed it.’
(183) a-fû-bi-n-e=be
3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘He has been holding it.’ (lit. ‘He has grabbed it and has been
staying up to now’)
The core class of perfective stems which can be serialized with a stem of the
existential verb in the function of an auxiliary are those which show this
aspect alternation. Perfective stems which belong to the core class almost all
lack an imperfective stem:8.6. TAM morphology of final verbs(184) -â’/—

is less obvious because they refer to activities, which are extended in time,
rather than to punctual events. Some of these have distinct imperfective stems,
for example:3088. Verb morphology(185) dowôn’

‘Yesterday, having eaten I was staying.’
As there is an obvious aspect mismatch in forms like dowôn’binisobe in (186),
which consists of a perfective stem dowôn’ ‘eat’ and an imperfective auxiliary
bi, the two events cannot be interpreted as overlapping but rather as a bounded
event plus the continuation of the result of this event, thus dowôn’binisobe
‘yesterday, having eaten I stayed’.
In order to express that the result of a bounded event is continuing at the
present moment, a perfective stem must be serialized with the imperfective
auxiliary stem bi which is then suffixed by -Ø ‘Imperfective’, as in (187):
(187) két=e
container=SG.N1
a-fû’-bi-Ø-e=be
3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘He’s holding the container’ (lit. ‘Having grabbed the container,
he’s staying’)
Imperfective stems generally do not have this possibility, but see 8.4 for
obligatorily auxiliary-serialized verbs in the imperfective (X-stems), where an
imperfective stem is followed by a form of the existential verb.","[331, 332, 333, 334]"
