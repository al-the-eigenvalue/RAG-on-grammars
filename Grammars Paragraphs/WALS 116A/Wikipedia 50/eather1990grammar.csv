"MoodParticles‘maybe'The particle mukkawa ‘maybe’, perhaps’ can either stand alone as a response expressing
indefiniteness, or can occur with (usually preceding) a clause or NP to suggest some doubtor lack of information about a proposition; sometimes mukkawa is used in posing a
question and also where in English we might use ‘either’ and ‘or’.

"‘T might’ (=maybe yes)b)Ngawa.,""Who knows’ (=I'm not going to say maybe yes)djawa‘couldbe’, ‘iftThis particle occurs very commonly in texts with a clause to indicate the possibility
of
outcome, ""X could happen/be so’, and, as with English ‘could’ djawainvolves a greatercommitment to the factive outcome of the proposition than mukkawa ‘may/might' or
ngawa. ‘maybe'. Nevertheless, the degree of possibility indicated by djawa is not fixed and
336ranges from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’, and in some examples is
interchangeable withdjarra(bba) ‘should’ and the potential particle ngamarramung. Unlike mukkawa and ngawa,djawa does not function as an interjection, and does not occur
in isolation. The particledjawa commonly occurs with conditionals and counterfactuals where it
introduces the
protasis and is glossed ‘if’.
The particle djawa can introduce both realis (see (148)) and
irrealis (see (147)) verbalclauses, but is more commonly associated with the irrealis; it can also
occur in verbless
clauses, as in (149), Like the other possibility particles, the presence of djawa often signalsa question form (also in (149)).","[357, 358]"
"InterjectionsThis is an open class of words. Because of the degree of multilingualism in Maningrida it isoften difficult to assign a given interjection to a particular language. Facility with several
94-OOdifferent languages lends a creative air to use of interjections, and there is certainly
a
common pool of expressions that can be included as members of this class of words.
This
situation provides a rich array of alternatives, such as the standard Nakkara forms
ngawd
‘yes' and korla ‘no’, (also used as a clause-modifying negative particle),
as well as
common abbreviations, extensions and accompanying gestures. For 'yes', awd (also
‘good

"Additional7.2.2, nangarda‘whatdjawafor', 'why',Interrogative/Indefiniteexpressionsusingnangardaand nangarda(wa) liyawa‘whatreason’,‘whatkind'These forms are usually used as interrogatives requesting more information about the
nature of an object or a reason why something happens or doesn't happen. They can
occasionally be found expressing indefiniteness, as in (54). The examples following best
capture the function of these formative phrases. Note firstly however that liyawa '3Minimal Oblique’ (=of/to it) is often shortened to liya and secondly that both nangarda
liya(wa) and nangardawa liya(wa) occur. I have not always been able to distinguishseparate meanings for these two forms (which indeed are sometimes interchangeable)
302except to say that nangardaya liya is more often used to question the nature of something
(‘what kind’) than the reason (‘why’) for its existence or occurrence (see (52) and (53)).
The form nangardawa liya can also occur as an indefinite form (as in (54)) and I have onlyfound nangarda liya as an interrogative.
The form nangarda djawa means literally ""could be something"" but is used where inEnglish we say 'why?' and also ‘what for?'. A more accurate translation for this might be
‘what reason?’ or ‘what cause?’ given that the stem ngarda also occurs in words likengardawa ‘because’.","[323, 324]"
"CardinalPronounsCardinal pronouns are the most widely functional of the three paradigms. They consist of a
pronominal stem with the suffix /+bba/. (Formal properties are discussed in some detail in4,3. to 4.3.1.3.)
Cardinal pronouns are unique among independent pronominal types on two counts. First,
any member of the paradigm can function within the bounds of a given clause construction
(as indicator of ‘core participant/s), or independently. of it (as in abbreviated response to a
question, e.g. Who's going? or Who did it?) Second, Cardinal pronouns can occur in
predicative possessive constructions. The pronoun occurs as a nominal stem (indicating
possessor) with an Attributive pronominal prefix, which cross-references the thing/s
“possessed. (See 4.5.1.3.)
Cardinal pronouns function within the clause as independent indicators of the core
participants.",[113]
"242The affix rda-, on the other hand, indicates that the subject participant's motion is directedaway from here (where I am) or away from this place (I speak of).
The affix na- is the more specific of the two orientation specifiers. Like demonstrative
forms nguya(bba) ‘here’ and +kara ‘this one here' the locational aspect of na- is specific
because of reference to a specific entity, namely the speaker. The non-specific locational
nature of ‘there’ (not near speaker) is lexicalized in Nakkara,where four differentdemonstratives stems can answer the question “But where there?"" (see 3.3.3.). Similarly,
direction of motion away from the speaker, coded by rda-, provides less specific
information about the location of the referent. This generality of reference leads, oddly
enough, to restrictions on the occurrence of the affix rda- (outlined below). NPs outside the
verb-complex can always be used to clarify a goal of motion or location of participants.
With intransitive verbs of motion the participant (S) is always the source of a motionaction. Some motion verbs are atelic in the sense that there is potential for the action to be
on-going; the goal need not be specified explicitly, as with verbs like:ya‘go, move, go along’(y)ba‘go, walk, go about'kawaya‘run'karama‘get up and/in order to move’With other verbs of motion there is a supposed end-point or goal somewhere in theof the verb, so they could be termed telic.:

_ The existence of contrasting stops in languages like Nakkara represents thenot
and also the most complex aspect of phonological analysis. It is a phenomenon
encountered in the bulk of Australian languages. In characterising the stop contrast,suited to their
analysts of individual languages have opted for the interpretation best13particular set of data. Three alternative interpretations appear in the literature; they differ inthe following ways.!
The segmental interpretation takes contrastive surface distribution of stops
at face value and assigns phonemic status to both stop series.
The geminate interpretation ultimately maintains a single series of stop
phonemes, accounting for the contrast in terms of single stops versus
""geminate"" clusters of two identical stops.
The third interpretation is referred to as the prosodic interpretation.and
focuses more on factors of causation than implementation of the contrast; itattributesstop variation to suprasegmentaldifferenceswhichcreatepredictable variants.
The Nakkara data demands two areas of inquiry for analysis. On the one hand the precise
phonetic nature of contrasting stops should be explored, and once established, their
phonological status needs to be determined.
The following sections explain the nature and implementation of contrasting stops inNakkara. Firstly, in section 2.3.1, the phonetic nature of the contrast is explored. The most
appropriate phonetic characterisation of the contrast is established after considering three
alternatives, a fortis/lenis opposition, a voiceless/voiced opposition and an opposition ofclosure duration. Duration is established as the principal phonetic factor and two alternative
directions emerge for phonological analysis of the stop contrast.
In section 2.3.2 and following I argue that unpredictable occurrences of long
stops in
Nakkara should be interpreted as clusters of two identical consonants distinguished
from
short stops by a feature [+long]. This conclusion can be summarised
as choice of ageminateinterpretationof the Stopcontrastin Nakkararather thana segmentalinterpretation.","[34, 35]"
"The Oblique pronoun occurs most frequently as an ""indirect object"" with verbs (see 8.2.
below). It can, however occur as a benefactive pronoun following nominals, and in thisfunction is similar to the possessive constructions exemplified above in that it forms a
verbless predicate/comment, as in the two examples following:(28)| Nkarabba nawaka ngorlawa.n+karabbanawakangorlawa3M_+this-here

"4.2.2, Genderand 2 UA""exclusive""With 2UA pronouns it is also possible for the additional person
in the set to be a nonparticipant absent from the situational context, rather than another addresse
e. ""You two' can
-be equivalent to ‘you and hirn/her’ as well as ‘you and you’. Given this situation
there is on
the one hand a 2UA category accepted generally to be inclusive, and
an alternative set
which excludes the additional addressee.
For unambiguous reference to this 2 UA ""exclusive"" set, the
gender of the person absent
will be relevant for choice of pronominal form. It is in this situation
alone that choice basedon a marked gender set does not apply. A feminine pronoun is only
used if the ""second
addressee"" is feminine, irrespective of the sex of the first addressee (and
of speaker).
Distribution of 2 UA forms is tabled at 4.2.2. below.",[120]
"1 These three salient alternatives have been well summarisedand considered (for Yolngu languages only) ina valuable document by Wood (1978). This provides a good
basis for the continuing debate on stop
contrast.",[35]
"The phonetic factors which distinguish stops in Nakkara are examined closely. Closureduration is shown to be the salient factor involved in the distinction. This conclusion leads
to a more natural statement of distributional constraints. These constraints point to and
draw on the important analogy between long stops and consonant clusters. This analogy
provides strong support for a geminate interpretation of unpredictable long stops.
The phenomenon of contrasting stops, as an areal feature of otherwise divergent languages,
demands further extensive research; in the meantime we must pretend satisfaction with aphonological problem that for most languages in the relevant areas has no straightforward
solution.
2.3.1. ThePhoneticFactorsThe aims of this section are to show that the commonly used terms ‘fortis' and ‘lenis’ are
not only phonetically vacuous, but, as subsequent discussion shows (section 2.3.3.3.),
their use in describing Nakkara data detracts from any analysis of the stop contrast bydisguising the true phonetic factors. I also show the unreliability of voicing as a
fundamental phonetic parameter involved in the stop contrast by drawing attention to
unpredictable voicing fluctuation in Nakkara stops. I conclude, with the support of resultsfrom mingograph readings, that duration alone is a significant variable and is the only
independently controlled phonetic parameter involved in the stop contrast in Nakkara.
Since the publication of Glasgows' article on geminate stops in 1967 many linguists
working in the area have agreed that the distinction perceived is one of quantity rather than
quality, but McKay's 1980 spectographic study provided the first evidence for this, from
which he concluded:
‘A comparison of lengths of occlusion for the geminate and single (fortis and lenis)stops shows clearly that the geminate (fortis) stops are considerably longer than the
single (lenis) stops.' (McKay, 1980:346)
In spite of this clarification of the phonetic factors involved in stop contrast, the termsfortis' and ‘lenis’ are still frequently used, either as terminological descriptions of the two
series or as additional features to characterise the distinction. Where the terms ‘fortis’ and‘lenis’ are not further qualified we must assume that they are used to suggest a perceived
contrast of articulatory force. A paper by Jeri Jaeger investigates these factors. Titled ‘The
Fortis/lenis question: Evidence from Zapotec and Jawofi’, she states:
‘Although these terms [fortis/lenis] are used frequently, and numerous attempts have been
made to define and substantiate their phonetic content, linguists continue to disagree on the
interpretation or validity of such evidence, and not all linguists are convinced that the
phonetic distinction indicated by these terms exists at all.' Jaeger, 1983:1)
The data from Jawoii, a language of south-west Arnhem Land (data collected by Francesca
Merlan) is particularly relevant, since the Jawofi stop series and alternation parallels the
situation found in Nakkara.
Jaeger shows firstly, on spectrographic grounds, that voicing is not a reliable cue for the
distinction between the contrasting stops; this point was also made by McKay (1980:346);
and in turn supports my own observation that in Nakkara there is considerable fluctuationbetween voiced and voiceless production of stops, particularly word-initially, but also in
word-medial clusters. Use of the features ‘fortis' and ‘lenis' to imply varying degrees ofarticulatory force in the stop contrast is convincingly rejected by Jaeger. In explaining why
clearly perceptible durational differences (see results in charts 2.3.1.1 (a), (b), (c)) do not
imply differences in 'force of articulation’ she states:‘The timing of the gestures of the muscles involved in speech production is an
independently and voluntarily controlled variable; the only way in which it takes
any extra force to sustain a gesture for a longer period of time is in the ratherredundant sense that the overall energy expended by a muscle will be more if it
fires longer.’ (Jaeger, 1983:15-16)Jaeger adds that the phonetic factors involved in the contrast are primarily duration, glottal
width and closure width and concludes that:‘the synaesthetic feeling of extra force is not justification enough for using these
terms when in fact other phonetic explanations are available.'","[35, 36, 37]"

(Characteristic Nominal)Because of the dozen or so monosyllabic verb roots in Nakkara and its agglutinative nature,
it is always tempting to decompose long and apparently complex verb forms. Does every
verb ending in the syllable ma have an underlying ‘get’ in its semantic structure? Do all
verbs with ka(from the root ‘take’) involve ‘take’, or ‘the hand’ as instrument? Theanswer to both questions is of course no. Not all verbs can be decomposed in this way.
“Some verbs, however, seem to support the hypothesis. This subject will be dealt with morefully outside this thesis in subsequent papers on word-formation in Nakkara.
6.6. The Derivational Prefix /na/
The principal function of the derivational prefix /na+/ is to derive a nominal, usually a
noun, either from other word classes or from other nominals. In section 4.5.3. this
derivational prefix was discussed and exemplified in conjunction with the Characteristicprefix, where /na+/ derives a nominal from a verb, as in the following example:
(97)‘man’, person’Wunakkelaya
wu-na(=one who understands}+kkelaya3M -DER +hear,
CHARunderstandIn section 4.5.3.2., in relation to the occurrence of /na+/ with the Characteristic prefix, Ihave referred to nouns and adjectives occurring with /na+/ as Extended Nominals.
Similarly, in section 3.3.3.3., Derived Demonstratives, and also in 4.7.3., the Ablative
Suffix, the term is equally appropriate. One of the apparent functions of /na+/ is to“prepare” a nominal stem for additional morphological material. The Characteristic prefix
can only occur with derived nominal forms; but not all derived nominals require a
Characteristic prefix. When demonstratives code non-specific reference, the derivational263prefix /na+/ (or the restricted dialectal variant /ra+/) replaces the pronominal prefixinflections. When certain nominal forms occur with an Ablative suffix /+-kkawa/ or with the
suffix /bba/ (see 4.7.1. to 4.7.1.4.) the nominal stem must take /na+/ as well as the suffixmorpheme.","[282, 283, 284, 285]"
"7.2. InterrogativesandIndefinitesIt is possible to cite Nakkara equivalents to a full set of English WH-interrogatives, such as
who?, what?, when?, where?, why?, but this gives an incomplete picture of the function of
these words. Some occurrences of these forms are both interrogative and indefinite, and
others are one or the other. Most interrogative forms have a range of meanings, which aredependent on context. The Interrogative and indefinite forms recorded to date in Nakkara
are tabled in 7.2. below.",[319]

forms with second person subjects (A) or (S) and always precedes the verb form (V). It
means ‘stop V-ing' or ‘never/don't ever V'. As far as I know it cannot be used to modify
any other word class (i.e. apart from a verb) and it never occurs as part of a composite ofparticles. The restriction to second person subject means that mungana is associated with
negative verb forms that are used as negative Imperative constructions (see also 5.4.2.3.),but, like the standard negative particle korla it does not actually occur with an Imperative
verb form. (Only the negative Imperative particle yingawa ‘don't’ occurs with Imperativeverb forms.) Restriction to irrealisy negative verb forms means that only Contemporary and
Future negative verb forms occur (i.e. C/T NEG and FUT NEG) with mungana. Examples

"The set of human status terms that occur with an Attributive prefix also includes terms for
‘female with child/ren’, ‘second born’, ‘older sibling’, ‘younger sibling’, ‘old person’,
‘unmarried person’, ‘female’ and ‘uncircumcised male’. Other status terms such as
‘circumcised male', ‘cripple’, ‘male/masculine’ and alternative terms for ‘old man/woman’.and ‘infant’ are uninflected forms or take non-Attributive inflections.
It was mentioned in 4.5.1.1. above that the only nominal forms that never occur with the
Attributive prefix are derived nouns formed with the prefix /na-/. There are two importantexceptions to this generalisation and as kin-terms these words for ‘woman’, ‘female’ and
‘man’, 'male' are discussed here. Thesingular formsare nawara and nakaddjararespectively. Non-singular forms use the Attributive prefix only after deletion of the
derivational prefix na+, as in kabarrwara ‘two women’, ngurrba(wa)ra ‘all us women’,kabanakaddjara ‘two men’, nurrbakaddjara ‘all you men’.
The kin terms referred to in this section are not the common vocative terms heard in
everyday speech. Vocative and many other descriptive kin terms occur with alternative
inflections. The set of kin terms that occur with an Attributive inflection denote specificreciprocal relationship pairs, like ‘mother and child’. They are in this sense dyadic kin
terms, There are only seven dyadic forms and they are used for reference to classificatory
as well as for real or blood relations. These dyadic kin terms form a closed set and are used‘to define all kin relations within the classificatory system of subsections used by Nakkara‘people.
Dyadic terms can be used instead of referring to the entities separately. A simple example is
use of the term which describes the relationship between Mother (and Mother's sibling/s)and child, Instead of (27), one can use the dyadic form, as in (28):117(27).

Demonstrative adverbs (see Table 7.1.1.a. above) also provide parameters of separationand distance, so in this sense they can be appended to the set tabled in 7.1.1.2.a. below.

ve Imperative particle ‘don't (see
5.4.2.3.) and as an interjection meaning ‘enough’,
'no more’. For these functions thegeneral gloss ‘at this/that time' is not appropriate. Positing an homonymous form for thelatter two functions provides no real solution because of thePresence of the same overlap
of form and function in neighbouring Ndjébbana (cf. yalaw
a ). It is, however, quite
another matter to provide the semantic link. The negative Impera
tive function of yingawa‘don't’ and its function as an interjection are easily linked in that both canbe paraphrased as‘no more' or ‘enough’. This in turn throws some light on yet another use of yingawa as anexpressionmeaning‘OK’,‘alright' (2=""good enough"")(cf.a similar use in GuuguYimidhirr , see Haviland (1979:152)) But very little can
be said at this point about the. semantic similarity between the negative Imperative functionof yingawa and the temporalconnective, the adverbial and the foregrounding functio
n. In terms of the two most
disparate functions we can observe that in both the negative
Imperative function and the
temporal connective function the presence of yingawa requires the
cessation of one action
or event and the subsequent introduction of another. In the negative Imperative constructionyingawa indicates an instruction to cease one action/event
