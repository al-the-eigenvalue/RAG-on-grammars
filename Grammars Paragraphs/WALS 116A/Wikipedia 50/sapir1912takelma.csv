yo""ga’n I shall marry her (192.16)_or a liquid or nasal (J, m, n), the question as to whether the verb

Descriptively it. makes no difference whether a form like p’elega'nI WENT TO WAR AGAINST THEM is derived from p‘eleg- by the inser
tion of the stem-vowel -e- between J and g (Type 3), or from p‘d-by the addition of the -e- to a base p‘el- (Type 2). From a purely
descriptive point of view, then, the most typical aorist formation 1Takelma may be said to be characterized by the repetition of the stenvowel immediately after the first consonant following the stem-vowel.
Fromthe point of view of vocalic quantity the verbs of Type 3fall into the same two classes as those of Type 2—such
short vowelas haveain the stem (t/amy-, ts!awy-, malg-, p‘elg-, hants!-) andsuch as have a long vowel (iits'!-, gi‘lb-, k/a%ls), these latter being
apparently much less numerous than in Type 2. The quantity of,
both the stem vowels of the aorist is regularly short, even when the
verb-stem vowel is long (gilib-, klalas-); only rarely is the secondvowel of the aorist stem long (leye’s-, tiyiits'!-).","[107, 108]"

"ETHNOLOGYElementsGENERAL[BULL.40(§§ 97-102)REMARKSUnder the head of post-nominal elements are included a small
group of suffixes which, though altogether without the distinct individuality characteristic of local postpositions, are appended to the
fully formednoun, pronoun, or adjective, in some cases also adverb,serving in one way or another to limit or extend the range of application of one of these denominating or qualifying terms. The line
of demarcation between these post-nominal elements and the more
freely movable modalparticles discussed below(§ 114) is not veryeasy to draw; the most convenient criterion of classification is the
inability of what we have termed PosT-NOMINAL elements to attach
themselves to verb-forms.

follows that which is primarily adverbial in character; thus:
ba-ide'‘didi’niklat‘ did you stretch it out? (=ba--out +de-lip,
in front + di interrogative particle + di’ntk!at‘ you stretched it)
In general it may be said that instances of a body-part prefix preceding a primarily adverbial element (like ba-i-, ba°-, he*‘-, and others)
are rare or entirely lacking.
From what has been said it might seem 1 that the connective and
modal elements (like yaza,mi’“wa, and di) are more closely associated
with the verb form than are the other elements, yet this is only
apparently the case. Properly speaking all these modal elements are
post-positives that normally attach themselves to the first word of3045°—Bull. 40, pt 2—12—5§ 3466BUREAUOF AMERICANETHNOLOGY[BULL.40the sentence, no matter what part the word plays in the sentence.
Thus in a form like me’*-di-giniga‘t‘ DID YoU COME? (= me‘- HITHER +
di- interrogative particle + giniga‘t’ You WENT TO), the modal (inter-rogative) element di regularly stands nearest the verb; but as soon as
another word is introduced before the verb, the interrogative particle
shoves back a step, and we have a form of sentence like, e. g., hoida’'s
di me’‘giniga‘t’ DID YOU COME AS SINGER, i. e., TO sinc? From thisit becomes fairly evident that the di in the first example is not properly a verbal prefix at all, but merely a post-positive particle depending upon the preceding me’‘, in the same way that, in the second
example, it depends upon the noun hoida’‘s stncER. This inference
is clinched by a form like giniga’t‘tdi pi» you ao (SOMEWHERE)!
for here the di is evidently an enclitic element, not a prefix.
In sharp contradistinction to such movability, the body-part and
adverbial prefixes occupy rigidly fixed positions before the verb;
they therefore belong to a class quite distinct from the modal particles. These latter are verbal prefixes only in so far as their postpositivetendencymayforcethemtobecomeembeddedin the.verb-complex, in which case they seem to cut loose the incorporated
object, adverbial prefix, and instrumental element from the verb.

"-(3) A falling inflection that starts at, or generally somewhat
higher than, the raised pitch of (1) and (2), and gradually slides
down to fall either in the same or immediately following syllable, to
a pitch somewhat lower than the normal (+).
The “raised” pitch (+) is employed only in the case of final short
vowels or shortened diphthongs (i. e., diphthongs that, owing to
speed of utterance, are pronounced so rapidly as to have a quantitative value hardly greater than that of short vowels; also sec-ondary
spokendiphthongs involving an inorganic a); if a short vowel ©
on a raised pitch be immediately followed by an unac-centedsyllable(aswillalwayshappen,if it is notthefinalvowel of the word), there will evidently ensue a fall in pitch in the
unaccented syllable, and the general acoustic effect of the two
syllables will be equivalent to a “falling” inflection (+) within one
syllable; i. e. (if — be employed to denote an unaccented syllable),
(\)+—=(¢).
The following illustration will make this clearer:
YoU SAN@ is regularly accented helela‘t', the a‘ being sung on an
interval of a (minor, sometimes even major) third above the two
unaccented e- vowels.
The acoustic effect to an American ear is very

"Not the least remarkable feature of tense-formation lies in the fact
that the most frequently used of the tense-modes, the aorist (equivalent
to immediate future, present, and past), generally shows the derived or
amplified form of the base; while the far less important tense-modes,
the future, inferential, potential, and present and future imperatives
employ the generally more fundamental verb-stem.

receive treatment.
In striking contrast to the extensive use in Athapascan of distinctand unrelated stems for the singular and plural, only a very few such
cases have been discovered in Takelma; and even in these the singular stem may, it seems, also be used in the plural.

2. Formation of Verb-Stems(§§ 39, 40)§ 39. GENERAL REMARKSBy a verb-stem will be here understood not so much the simplest
possible form in which a verb appears after being stripped of all its
prefixes, personal elements, tense-forming elements, and derivativesuffixes, but rather the constant portion of the verb in all tense and
mode forms except the aorist. The verb-stem thus defined will in
the majority of cases coincide with the base or root, i. e., the simplestform at which it is possible to arrive, but not always. Generally
speaking, the aorist is characterized by an enlargement of the base
that we shall term “‘aorist stem,’ the other tense-modes showing
this base in clearer form; in a minority of cases, however, it is the
aorist stem that seems to coincide with the base, while the verb-stemis an amplification of it.

the simplest radical element that can be analyzed out remains dissyllabic(as in dawi- FLY, agan- PERCEIVE, yimi- LEND), the proba-bility is always very great that we have to reckon either with amplifications of the base, or with suffixes that have become so thoroughly
amalgamated with the base as to be incapable of separation from it

the verb-stem is due to a secondary phonetic reason (thus dawi- is

of containing a petrified suffixed element.
The few examples of verb and aorist stems already given suffice to
indicate the lack of simple, thorough-going regularity in the formation of the aorist stem from the base. Given the verb-stem, it ispossible only in the minority of cases to foretell the exact form of the
aorist stem. Thus, if dd“m- had followed the analogy of the phonetically parallel na@*g-, we should have in the aorist not t/omom-,

§ 99. PLURAL(-f<an, -han, -k/an)As a rule, it is not considered necessary in Takelma to specify the
singularity or plurality of an object, the context generally serving to
remove the resulting ambiguity.
In this respect Takelma resemblesmany other American languages. The element -(a)n, however, is
aot infrequently employed to form a plural, but this plural is of
rather indefinite application when the noun is supplied with a third
personal possessive suffix (compareregard to -gwan).what was said above,§ 91, inThe fact that the plurality implied by the suffixmay have reference to either the object possessed or to the possessoror to both (e. g., beya’nhan HIS DAUGHTERSor THEIR DAUGHTER,THEIR DAUGHTERS) makes it very probable that we are here dealing,not with the simple idea of plurality, but rather with that of reciprocity. It is probably not accidental that the plural -(a)n agrees
phonetically with the reciprocal element -an- found in the verb.","[252, 253]"
"In some respects Takelma is typically American, in so far as it is
possible at all to speak of typical American linguistic characteristics.
Some of the more important of these typical or at any rate widespread American traits, that are found in Takelma, are: the incorporation of the pronominal (and nominal) object in the verb; the
incorporation of the possessive pronouns in the noun; the closerassociation with the verb-form of the object than the subject; dl
inclusion of a considerable number of instrumental and local m
cations in the verb-complex; the weak development of differences
tense in the verb and of number in the verb and noun; and t
impossibility of drawing a sharp line between mode and tense.
§ 116poss]HANDBOOKOFINDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA283Of the more special grammatical characteristics, some of which are
nearly unparalleled in those languages of North America that have
been adequately studied, are: a system of pitch-accent of fairly considerable, though probably etymologically secondary, formal significance; a strong tendency in the verb, noun, adjective, and adverb
toward the formation of dissyllabic stems with repeated vowel (e. g.,
aorist stem yowo- BE; verb-stem loho- DIE; noun mozo‘ BUZZARD;
adjective hos-d"" [plural] GzTTIna Bia; adverb olo‘m FORMERLY); &very considerable use of end reduplication, initial reduplication being
entirely absent; the employment of consonant and vowel changes as a
grammatical process; the use in verbs, nouns, and adjectives of pre-fixed elements, identical with body-part noun stems, that have reference now to parts of the body, now to purely local relations; the
complicated and often irregular modifications of a verbal base for
the formation of the most generalized tense, the aorist; the great
differentiation of pronominal schemes according to syntactic rela-tion, class of verb or noun, and tense-mode, despite the comparatively
small numberof persons(only five—two singular, two plural, andone indifferent); the entire lack in the noun and pronoun of cases
(the subjective and objective are made unnecessary by the pronominal
and nominal incorporation characteristic of the verb; the possessive,
by the formal use of possessive pronoun affixes; and the local cases,by the extended use of pre-positives and postpositions) ; the existence
in the noun of characteristic suffixes that appear only with prepositives and possessive affixes; the fair amount of distinctness that
the adjective possesses as contrasted with both verb and noun; the
use of a decimal system of numeration, tertiary or quinary in origin;and arather efficient though simple syntactic apparatus of subordinating elements and well-modulated enclitic particles. Altogether
Takelma has a great deal that is distinct and apparently even isolated
about it. Though typical in its most fundamental features, it may,
when more is known of American languages as a whole, have to
be considered a very specialized type.","[288, 289]"
"OFAMERICANETHNOLOGY[BCLL.40In regard to the pronunciation of the various consonants,w, s, y, h, l, m, and n do not differ naterially from the corresponding
sounds in English.
The first two series of stops—tenuis (p‘, é‘, k‘) and media (b, d, g)—. do not exactly correspond to the surd and sonant stops of English or
French.",[38]
"A labial coloring of the a (i. e., 6 as in German VoLL) frequently
occurs before and after k‘”:

malakwa he told him
The ¢ is an open sound, as in the English LET; it is so open, indeed,
as to verge, particularly after y, toward a.! Also the long vowel e¢is very open in quality, being pronounced approximately like the e7
of English THEIR(but of course withoutthe r- vanish)or the é ofFrench rére; e¢, though unprovided with the mark of length, will
be always understood as denoting the long vowel (pseudo-diphthong)
corresponding to the short e; while é will be employed, wherever
necessary, for the long vowel without the parasitic --.",[19]
"3048]HANDBOOKOFINDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA61within the first six groups is to list them as miscellaneous cases.
Such are:
gwel-letsdet I shall be lame (cf. gwel-la’is klemna’n I shall make
him lame
le*psi‘ wing (if derived, as seems probable, from stem lé*b- carry)tlemeya’nwia“ peoplego along to see her married 178.1(cf.tamayana’'n I take her somewheres to get her married [148.5])
Palatal ablaut, it should be noted, does not affect the -a- of the
second member of reduplicated verbs:
t‘galt‘ga'l it bounced from her 140.8t‘geltg‘a’/Isi it bounced from me
The connecting vowel, however, of verbs reduplicated according to
the third type always follows the stem-vowel:
dak‘da-hele’ halzade§ I am accustomed to answer (stem -2a@4I-)It is difficult to find a very tangible psychic connection between the
various cases that require the use of the palatal ablaut, nor is there
the slightest indication that a phonetic cause lies at the bottom of
the phenomenon.
If we disregard the first group of cases, we shall
find that they have this in common, they are all or nearly all intransi-tives derived from transitives by means of certain voice-forming elements (-z-, -xa-, -gwi-, -k‘wa-), or else nominal passives or derivatives
of such intransitives (-ak'”, -<-ap'); -k‘wa-, it is true, takes transi-tive pronominal forms; but it is logically intransitive in character
in that it indicates action in reference to something belonging to the
subject. The only trait that can be found in common to the first
group and the remaining is that the action may be looked upon as:
self-centered; just as, e. g., a form in -za- denotes that the (logically)
transitive action is not conceived of as directed toward some definite
outside object, but is held within the sphere of the person of central
interest (the subject), so, also, in a form with incorporated first person singular object, the action may be readily conceived of as taking
place within the sphere of the person of central interest from the
point of view of the speaker. No difficulty will be found in making
this interpretation fit the other cases, though it is not conversely true
that all forms implying self-centered action undergo palatalization.","[66, 67]"

Remove(all thoughtfrom your mind)that youmight, wouldgo (i. e., do not go!)
The inferential, as we have seen above (see § 59), is used primarilyto indicate that the action is not directly known through persona

"The uses of thepotential and inferential will be best illustrated by examples given
after the forms themselves have been tabulated. In a general way
the potential implies the ability to do a thing, or the possibility of
the occurrence of a certain action or condition (I CAN, COULD Go if Icare, cared to), and thus is appropriately used in the apodosis of an
unfulfilled or contrary-to-fact condition; it is also regularly employedin the expression of the negative imperative (prohibitive). The |
peculiar form of the potential (verb-stem with aorist pronoun endings)
seems in a measure to reflect its modal signification, the identity of
its stem with that of the future indicating apparently the lack of
fulfillment of the action, while the aoristic pronominal elements may
be interpreted as expressing the certainty of such fulfillment under
the expressed or implied circumstancesby the person referred to.",[164]

Yuk'ya’k'wa gede right by Yik‘ya’k‘wa 188.17Postpositions may be freely used with nouns provided with a possessive suffix; e. g., ela’t‘k’ gada‘k* ON MY TONGUE; wild’? gana‘u IX
HIS HOUSE, cf. 194.7. There is no ascertainable difference in signification between such phrases and the corresponding pre-positive forms,
dak‘-eladé and ha-wili'/‘da. Sometimes a postposition takes in a
group of words, in which case it may be enclitically appended to the
first:
khiyi’x gan‘au ba-igina’xda* smoke in its-going-out (= [hole] inwhich smoke is to go out) 176.7
Although local phrases involving a postposition are always pronounced as one phonetic unit, and the postpositions have become,
psychologically speaking, so obscured in etymology as to allow of
their being preceded by the demonstrative with which they are then-selves compounded (cf. ga ga‘a‘l above), they have enough individuality to render them capable of being used quasi-adverbially without |

1 Yuk'ya’k'wa gada was said tobe preferable, whence it seems possible that gede isnot yeally equivalent
to ga THAT + de- IN FRONT, but is palatalized as adverb (see below, § 104) from gadda,
