"5.5.1 Interrogatives.
There are two types of interrogatives in the language. One type for polar
questions and another type for non-polar questions.
Polar questions have the same form as declaratives but with rising
intonation at the end of the utterance to indicate a question:
(S.64) ma- y
kari-m paret dirup- o?
2SgA-Deix lSg- All dirt sweep-Fut2/3
'Will you sweep for me?'
(S.65) ma suga
dikri- o?
2SgA <EngO throw-Fut2/3
'Have you put in sugar?
Non-polar questions require an interrogative pronoun or clitic inserted at
the beginning of the utterance. The form of the interrogative depends on what is
being questioned (see the section on Interrogative Pronouns, p72). Although
these typically occur at the beginning, they can follow a pronoun:
(S.66) ma nalu ike-li?
2SgA whatO do- Prlmpf
'What are you doing?'
192The attention getting particle aka 'hey!' is often inserted at the beginning
of an utterance such as a question to attract the addressee's attention:
(5.67) (aka) ma- y
idimge bakyamu- 0
awgog- em?
hey 2SgS-Deix morning-Loe Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 big climb-All
'(Hey,) are you going up to the top of the hill tomorrow?
(5.68) aka ka ge- ka ut
na- ydilu
able uteb- ge?
hey lSgS Deix-lSgS sleep Futl-n PIS lie down-FutlSg Det place-Loe
'Hey, will I sleep here at this place?
There is a particle -aw which is cliticised onto the last word in the sentence.
It operates like a tag question asking for confirmation or just checking to see
whether the speaker has the addressee's attention:
(5.69) ma kcira mir asor- 0aw?
2SgA lSgGen word listen-Fut2/3-tag
'You will listen to what I am saying, won't you?'
(5.70) e
no teb+teb
baka-aw?
3SgS Restr alone Adj go- tag
'He went on his own, didn't he?'
There is also a vocative suffix -oy affixed to a proper noun when the person
being addressed is distant or non-visible. When the person is close-by, no marker
is used:
(5.71) Kosir-oy 'hey Kosir!'
Warib-oy 'hey W arib!'
Eydyana-oy 'hey Eidiana!'
?Pomoy-oy 'hey Pomoy!'
Examples need to be collected to see whether this suffix can be used when
kinship terms or common nouns are used for address forms:
?ama-oy
'hey mother!'
?berbet-oy 'hey sibling!'
?nap-oy
'hey grandchild!'
?kerim le-oy 'hey boss!'
It can also be used with interrogative pronouns where the forms will differ
depending on whether what is being questioned is animate (-oy) or inanimate
(-ay): e.g. nete-oy 'who?'; nalu(w)-ay 'what?'
l
i.I'5.5.2 Imperatives.
As we saw earlier in the section on temporal/ aspectual morphology, there
is no distinction between the future and the imperative for 2nd person. The
same form of the verb is used for both functions. However, the pronoun can be
omitted when it is being used with an imperative function:193(5.72)wapum+wapum ero-0
slow Intens?
eat-Fut2/3
'Eat slowly.'
(5.73) able
erw-am
Det N? eat- Fut2/3Dual
'Eat this (you two).'
When it is a negative imperative, the verb can be used in its nominal form
with the privative suffix:
(5.74) nole ero-0
nole aro- kak
Neg eat-Fut2/3
Neg eatN-Priv
'Don't eat it.'
Note, however, that the privative nominal is actually ambiguous for the
utterance could be interpreted as '(It's) inedible' although there is a different
intonation for each.
5.5.3 Reported Speech.
No examples of indirect speech have been collected in the data despite the
fact that there are some 150 pages of texts. The most common strategy is to report
speech directly. A complement kega can optionally be used to introduce the
speech act. It may be related to the following deictic markers: ke(y) 'in this
manner, way' + ga 'and then, and also there':

asked her: ""Hey, what are you?"" Dew said to him: ""!am a person."" Dew
asked him in tum: ""Are you a person (or) are you a ghost?"" Irwam said
to her: ""! am a person.""'
5.6Negation.
The negation particle nole - ne (these are in free variation) 'not, no' must
precede the verb and typically occurs following the first accented element in the
utterance to negate an event:
(5.77) wi
kikem-ge
3n SgS first- Loe
le
nole umer-kak da-r(a)a
Neg know-Priv I -3n SgS-1 n PIS be(person)-PrlmpfPauc
'They did not know at first.' (Dewmer, p213, section28)
(5.78) e

'She did not properly wipe off the mud on her face.'
(5.79) ma nole abi dip0
2SgA Neg 3Sg0 dob in- Fut2/3
'Don't dob him in.'
The negation particle can sometimes occur at the beginning of a clause
which is intonationally dependent on the preceding clause:
(5.80) wi
sikak we- ge akarik-ley,
3n SgS okay beach-Loe land- PastDual
nole lelut yabi
nardar-i
Neg person-SgA 3n SgO 3n SgO-see- Pf
'They (2) landed on the beach, allright, no-one saw them.'
(Dewmer, p209, section7)
5.7Valency Changes.
In the section on the intransitiviser ba-, the prefix was shown to make
transitive verbs intransitive either by making the A the S argument as it is
reflexive, or by making the 0 the S argument of the intransitivised verb. This
process is exploited in the language for a number of So/listic effects.
The intransitiviser can be used with events affecting inalienable body parts
where the Sis reflexive and the non-S argument, if there is one, is either
interpreted as a non-syntactic argument or as part of the verb phrase:195(5.81)·,
Iimus ba- tu- Ii
lSgS beard Intr-shave-Primpf
'I am shaving myself.' (lit: I am beard-shaving)
(5.82) Gamalay ba- trimurik-li
G.S
lntr-stretch- Primpf
'Gamalay is stretching.'
Contrast 5.81 with 5.83 and 5.82 with 5.84:
(5.83) Lez-ide tabara imus itw- i
L.- A 3Gen beardO shave-Pf
'Les shaved his beard.'
(5.84) ka netat teter erapeyda, ka netat teter itrimurik-da
lSgA one footO break Sg/DualO-PfSg lSgA one footO stretch- PfSg
'I have one leg folded, I have one leg stretched out.'
A much larger corpus of data is required to establish what the meaning
difference is between using the transitive and the intransitive forms. To date,
only events involving body parts have been collected with this kind of case frame
and one could hypothesize that there is a preference for these types to be treated
in this way because an intransitivised verb allows the 0 to be expressed within
the verb phrase, making it parallel in form and function to reflexive
constructions.
There is an innovation in the use of the intransitiviser bai which is
sometimes being used for events that are not necessarily reflexive, but rather
because the same pronominal free form is used. As was seen earlier, the same
pronominal forms can be used for the reflexive, i.e. oneself, as well as the
exclusive meaning, i.e. by oneself:
(5.85) ka imus itw- i kababu
lSgA beardO shave-Pf Exel
'I shaved my beard by myself.'
(5.86) ka kababu imus ba- twi
lSgS lSgRefl beard Intr-shave-Pf
'I shaved myself.'
However, speakers are sometimes making the verb intransitive when it is
the intensive pronominal function:
(5.87) ma
mabu
ba- smer-0
2SgA/S Refl/Excl lntr-see- Fut2/3
'See yourself - See for yourself.'
Thus, the presence of the intransitiviser morpheme doe.6 not,in such
instances) , indicate a reflexive action.It is the result of the pronominal free
form, marking a reflexive action (i.e. 5=0) and/or an exclusive meaning (i.e.
nonsyntactic).
ka1965.8Periphrastic Constructions.
Inchoative and causative events are typically expressed periphrastically.
Causative constructions have two verbs: the causing event and the resulting
change of state. Inchoative constructions also have two verbs: an intransitive
activity type verb and the resulting change of state. Let us examine each type in
turn.
The verbs ikay 'make Sg/DualO' and iker 'make Pauc/PlO' express the
causal part of the event with the A acting upon the 0, and the inchoative verb
expresses the result with the 0 of 'cause' usually the S of 'become' (bay 'Sg/DualS
become' and ber 'Pauc/PlS become'). Here are some examples:
(5.88) wi
nakerda
3n SgA 3n SgO-make Pauc/Pl0-P£Pl
tewpay mir berda
short word pauc/ plS become-perfpl
'They have made the words become short.'
(5.89) kaba- yde abi ikayda ekesmu- da
banana-A 3Sg0 make Sg/DualO-PfSg split intr.-PfSg
'The banana (tree) has made it (the pipe) split.'
(5.90) Lez-ide bakir ikayda lawlaw bayda
L.- A stoneO make Sg/DualO-PfSg tableS Sg/DualS become-PfSg
'Les made a table out of a stone/ Les made the stone into a table.'
Causal verbs can occur outside causative constructions meaning 'tell' (with
'word' incorporated into the verb complex) and 'swive' (with the paucal/plural
form of the verb being used which could be an idiomatic use)':
(5.91) kimyaride taba koskir
mir ikay-da
married man-A 3Gen married femaleO word tell- PfSg
aw mir+mir koskir

'The husband told his wife. She is a big talker.'
(5.92) ka mad naker- e
1SgA 2Sg0 Fut1+1/2Sg0-swive-Fut1
'I will swi ve you.'
With inchoative events, there is a clear preference to express it as a
complex event involving an intransitive activity type verb with an S argument
(akay 'Sg/DualS do' and eker 'do') and the inchoative verb (bay 'Sg/DualS
become' and ber 'Pauc/PlS become'). Here are some examples:
(5.93) e
akayda kimyar bayda
3SgS Sg/DualS do-PfSg man
Sg/DualS become-PfSg
'He has become a man.'
...Je kimyar bay-da197(5.94)ege epigeme-lu

'She then changed, turned into a stone.' (D6pem, p218, section25)

sea-Intens-All Fut3-Sg/DualS become-Fut2/3
maykeaw wag
close big wind
'If the sea turns a deep sea colour (i.e. murky), a big wind (is) nearby.'
Although little can be said about the precise meaning of the intransitive
verbs 'do', it can be pointed out that these verbs are used to mark the inception of
a process and that they always are intransitive with an S argument and the
second nominal, if there is one, being either a non-syntactic argument or part of
the complex verb phrase:
(5.96) ma nole sirib- ge akay0
2SgS Neg shame-Loe Sg/DualS be-Fut2/3
'Do not start to become ashamed.'
(5.97) e
ni
aryem eke-Ii
3SgS water drinkN-All do- Prlmpf
'He is just about to drink.'
(i.e. the glass is pressed against his lips and he is about to drink.)
(5.98) able kimyar
pe able newr
somay-ge eke-Ii
Det married manS Deix Det unmarried female lust- Loe do- Prlmpf
'That man there has started lusting after that girl.'
(Note that the role of the non-S nominal is not understood although it may be
literally: ?That man is doing that girl lust.)
The forms of the inchoative verbs warrant some discussion as well. Note
the resemblance between these forms, i.e. bay, ber, and the causative and
intransitive 'do' forms, i.e. ikay, iker, and, akay, aker. It may be that the forms are
derived from the transitive verb with the intransitiviser ba- although the
transformation also involves an odd change, namely the loss of the initial vowel
and consonant.
5.9Clause Relators.
We saw in the section on deictic markers that these sometimes fulfill a
function parallel to that fulfilled by subordinate (relative) clause markers in other
languages. One of the main differences is the lack of syntactic dependency
between the two clauses although there is often intonational dependency198between the two. In addition, there are several clause relaters which overtly
signal a semantically subordinate relationship between the clause in which they
occur and the main clause. The verb in the subordinate clause, however, has full
inflectional markings, i.e. it is finite. Here are some of the relaters and an
example of each:
temporal clause relaters:

'Flatten it so that it becomes really flat.'
Some of the clause relators have other functions which do not mark a
dependent clause. For example, kewbu can either serve to introduce a temporal
dependent clause meaning 'after' or it can be used as an adverb meaning 'later,
behind':
(5.112) ka na- ba kewbu
lSgS Futl-go later
'I will go later /behind.'
Clause relators can be distinguished from their other functions because
they always occur at the beginning of the clause (except when there is a pronoun
which can precede it).
There is also a co-ordinating conjunction a 'and, or' which can link two
words, phrases or clauses together. This may be a borrowing from English 'and':

A number of the clause relators can combine with each other providing
there is no conflict in meaning. A full description of the relators syntactic and
functional role within the clause or sentence awaits further study.","[203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213]"

The locative case is also used in an idiomatic expression suffixed to an
animate noun to indicate that a situation or decision is dependent upon the
person in question:

substituted).

'The times are up to you.'
(i.e it's all up to you as to how often and how long we work)

There is an additional pronominal set which functions both as a reflexive/
reciprocal pronoun and as an 'exclusive' pronoun. In the latter function, it
provides information about the will or high level of involvement of the Sor A,
i.e. A or S exclusively. Its meaning is captured by the following paraphrase: by
oneself, by one's own free will, on one's own. It does have a semantic restriction
in that it must be co-referent with the S or A. The forms themselves are derived
from other pronominal forms:
kababu 'myself, on my own' < ka lSgA/S
kerbibu 'ourselves, on our own (n SgExcl)' < kerbi ln SgExclO
merbibu 'ourselves, on our own (n Sglncl)' < merbi ln SglnclO
mabu 'yourself, on your own (Sg)' <ma 2SgA/S
wabu 'yourself, on your own (n Sg)' < wa 2n SgA/S
tababu 'himself, herself, themselves, on his/her/their own (non)Sg'
< taba(ra) 3Gen
Note that the dual function of this set is parallel to the English pronominal
set with 'self: which can be used for both reflexive/reciprocal events, e.g. I hit
myself, and to mark an exclusive role in the action, e.g. I did it by myself.
Some examples of the two uses follow:
(2.252) ma mara meta dimr- i mabu?
2SgA 2SgGen houseO build-Pf 2SgExcl
'Did you build your house on your own?'
(2.253) e
bakyamu- da tababu, taba obige
3SgS Sg/DualS go-PfSg 3Excl 3Gen mind,will-Loc
'He went of his own accord.'
(2.254) mabu+mabu
2SgExcl
'Help yourself (to the food)!'
(usually said at a feast to encourage people not to be shy and to serve
themselves)70(2.255) able koskiret tababu able lamar erdar-i
Det (married)female-SgA 3Excl Det spiritO see- Pf
'The woman, herself, saw the ghost.'
(i.e. it was not someone else who saw it)
The two functions are usually kept distinct because when the pronoun is
being used in a syntactic function (i.e. as a reflexive/reciprocal pronoun), the verb
has the intransitiviser prefix ba-. Thus:
(2.256) ma mabu ba- smer-o
2SgS 2SgRefl Intr-see- Fut2/3sg
'See yourself.'
(2.257) ma mabu dasmer-o
2SgA 2SgExcl seeFut2/3sg
'See for yourself.'
However, the language is in a state of flux with many speakers using the
intransitivising prefix on the verb as the only signal for reflexive/reciprocal
actions and reserving the pronoun for the exclusive meaning but with the
intransitivising prefix on the verb as well. Thus:
(2.258) werem ba- mrida
childS Intr-sit down-PfSg
'The child sat himself down.'
(2.259) werem tababu ba- mrida
childS 3Excl Intr-sit down-PfSg
'The child sat himself down on his own.'
What seems to be happening is that the presence of the pronoun is
automatically triggering the intransitive form of the verb irrespective of whether
the action is reflexive/reciprocal or not. This change is probably due to the high
frequency of the two meanings of the pronoun (i.e. as both an exclusive marker
and a reflexive/reciprocal marker).
One can speculate on the origin of this set of pronouns. Ray, in his study
(1907), gives the following set of genitive singular pronouns:
kaba-ra 1SgGen (>modern: kara)
maba-ra 2SgGen (>modern: mara)
taba-ra 3SgGen
(>modern: tabara)
These may have been the source of the roots of the pronominal set
discussed above. Note that the affix -bu that occurs suffixed to the pronouns,
e.g. kababu 'on my own', might be a particle or it might be derived from the
instrumental nominal suffix -u, e.g. bakir-u 'with a stone'. The consonant may
have been inserted because of two vowels occurring across a morpheme
boundary, e.g. kaba+u ---> kaba-b-u. (Consonant insertion is attested elsewhere
with the instrumental case, e.g. lu 'thing'---> lug-u 'with something'.) The
choice of the bilabial stop insertion could have been due to the presence of a71bilabial stop in the root (except for mabu, *mababu which was affixed to maintain
regularity within the paradigm). Thus, these free-standing pronominal forms
might be derived from the instrumental case but whose meaning is to provide
information about the clause as to the volition or the unique participation of the
A/S.
Interrogative/Indefinite Pronouns.
There is a set of interrogative words used with non-polar questions such as
nete 'who', netim 'to who, for who', nade 'when, where', nalug-lam 'why, from
what', etc. Within this set are included: nade 'when, where~ which is used to
introduce a temporal or spatial adverbial clause, and nako 'what (to do)~ which is
used to introduce an activity clause. Interrogative words follow a case marking
pattern similar to nouns, an ergative-absolutive pattern, i.e. A versus S/O for
non-humans, and a three way split, i.e. A, S and 0 for humans.
The interrogative/indefinite pronominal paradigm is as follows:
nete 'who'
nalu 'what'
A
net-ide
nalug-ide
s
nalu (... nalulu)
nete
0
neti
Locative
neti-doge
nalug-e
Allative
neti-m
nalug-em
Ablative
neti-alam
nalug-lam
Genitive
neti-ra
nalug-ira
Associative
neti-pkem
Instrumental
nalug-u
Some of the interrogative words cannot be broken down into morphemes
and must be listed in the lexicon. These include:
nete 'who'
nade 'when, where'
nako 'what'
Other words are formed by the interrogative proclitic na-. For example:
na-lu 'what' (lit: Q clitic-thing)
na-ged-ge 'where' (lit: Q clitic-land mass-Loe)
na-ged-im (-nagadim) 'where to' (lit: Q clitic-land mass-All)
na-nyay+nyay 'how long (in time)' (lit: Q clitic-time N)
na-war-ge 'what time' (lit: Q clitic-length of time-Loe)
na-kerker-ge 'what time' (lit: Q clitic-point in time-Loe)
na-piri 'how long (in space)' (lit: Q clitic-length)
na-urut-ge 'what year' (lit: Q clitic-year-Loc)72Interrogative pronouns typically occur at the beginning of a sentence or
immediately following a sentence-initial pronoun. Examples to illustrate
interrogatives, their position and their inflections follow:
(2.260) net- ide keriba
lewer aysli?
who-A ln SgExclGen foodO carry Pauc/PlO-Primpf
'Who is taking our food?' (D6pem, p217, section13)

'Who did the woman see?'
(2.263) e
nalug- u
abi ipit-i?
3SgA Q clitic-thing-Instr 3Sg0 hit- Pf
'What did he hit him with?'
There is no distinction between A, S or 0 for nonsingular interrogative
pronouns. Thus:
neti-de
'who A (Sg)'
nete
'who S (Sg)'
neti
'who 0 (Sg)'
net-iba
'who A/S/0 (n Sg)'
(2.264) net- iba obakyaware?

'Which two are cooking the food?'
(2.266) ?ma net- iba da-rasmer-da?
2SgA who-n Sg I -3n SgO- I see- P£Pl
'Which people did you see?'
The interrogative pronoun with the ergative plural case marking does not
exist, i.e. *nete-gize. However, the interrogative word formed by the question
clitic and the word le 'person' does have an A plural form and an S plural form
(the plural S form is not acceptable to all speakers):
(2.267) nalelut? (\el\..\t:.1fre~ular-{ormof le.''pef""Son'+et~68A"")
Q clitic-person-SgA

"IllIll is a voiced alveolar lateral which can sometimes sound quite 'dark' or
velarized when it occurs at the end of a word or syllable:
/1/
----->f I - #
mel'pcnr'black sea snake'
C
Ga.l'gal' 'nickname for Galiga'
BuMntt' 'place name'
manyapu~ 'pawpaw'
abal 'pandanus fruit'
-------->! I elsewhere
lam 'leaf'
goli 'squid sp.'
nalu 'what?'/ml
/n/
The voiced nasal stops are produced by air passing through the nasal
cavity with the lips pressed together for the bilabial stop and the tongue pressed
against the alveolar ridge for the alveolar stop. Note that the nasal stops
correspond to the point of articulation of the bilabial and apical stops although
there is a gap in the system as there is no nasal corresponding to the velar oral
stop.;w/
/y/
The glides include the bilabial continuant /w I and the palatal continuant
iy/. It is not dear-cut as to whether these are phonemically consonants or vowels
and the following discussion raises some of the reasons for considering each
analysis in preference to the other.
Arguments for considering the glides as underlying vowels:
(i)
There is a speech style called nasnas mir 'sorry talk' which is used by the
speaker to convey sympathy I grief for the topic (which might also be the
addressee). The phonetic change that takes place only affects verbs and more
specifically the initial vowel or vowel plus glide sequence in the verb. If the
initial vowel is /a/, then a glide /w/ is prefixed to it. If it is any other vowel or
vowel plus glide, these are deleted and a back vowel /u/, /o/ or /w/ is inserted:10#V[ +high,+front] C V[ +high,+front] ----> #u C V[+high,+front]
---> #(C) wa
#(C) a
-----> #(C) o
elsewhere
For example:
dwali 'n PIS be(person) Primpf'
da-li
---->
dogem 'walk'
digem
---->
or6 'eat'
er6
---->
iri
---->
uri 'smoke, drink'
When there is a vowel plus glide sequence, both phones are deleted and
replaced by a back vowel:
ewpamaret------> 6pamaret 'jump'
This provides some evidence that these are underlying vowels for the fact
is that the replacement by the vowel affects both vowel and glide if there is one.
This suggests that glides could be part of the vowel system as rules affecting
vowels also affect them.
On the other hand, it is generally regarded that glides do share features in
common with vowels and hence their frequent label as semi-vowels. The above
phonetic changes can simply be regarded as evidence of features in common
between vowels and glides.
(ii)
There is an example of a word that has the sequence glide plus vowel and
when it is abbreviated, the glide becomes syllabic which suggests it must be
underlyingly a vowel:
negwam ------>
negu 'cousin'
(i.e. w --> u)
Conversely, one can state the change in terms of a glide becoming syllabic when
there is no other vowel in the syllable.
(iii)
There is morphophonemic evidence that at least some verbs have as their
underlying form a vowel sequence rather than a vowel plus glide sequence:
b-6s 'pl S be born'
e-wsmer 'n PIS be born' (i.e. underlyingly eo)
parallel to:
ba-wm 'pl S die'
e-wmi 'nonpl s die' (i.e. underlyingly ew)
The use of the glide symbol in the word ewsmer obscures the
morphophonemic relationship between the sequence /ew/ and /o/ whereas if
one represents it as a vowel sequence /eo/ (with rules that apply later and
transform the sequence eo --->ew, the change is more transparent and easier to
account for. However, the relationship between the two forms is not always as
clear. If one considers the following examples where the future 1st person is
marked by the infixation of the vowel I a/, in the first example, i--->aw whilst in
the second example, i---->ay:
diski 'open Sg/DualO'
I Idawskilu 'open Sg/DualO Futl'
dimi 'close Sg/DualO'
daymilu 'close Sg/DualO Futl'
Thus, the rule can only be formulated very generally stating that an
accented vowel will become a vowel plus glide sequence when an affix (prefix or
infix) is attached. Is it appropriate to use morphology to prove something in the
domain of phonology? Whilst it is the linguist's task to assemble data from all
areas and assess these in relation to each other, it does not necessarily follow that
an analysis in one area justifies a particular analysis in a different area.
(iv) There are examples in the data where the vowel plus glide sequence
sounds like a complex rather than a single peak; it sounds like two syllables
rather than a single syllable. Examples contrasting single and complex peaks
follow:
peybri-peibri 'name of a clan, moiety(?)'(3syll) peym 'dream'(lsyll)
bawr- baur 'spear'(2syll)
baw 'enter'(lsyll)
Bewr- Beur 'village name'(2syll)
Dew 'village name'(lsyll)
Note that if the examples in the first group were transcribed with the extra
syllable (e.g. eyi), then there could be no claim that the underlying forms were a
monophone vowel sequence as they would represent a sequence of two syllables
with the glide marking a syllable boundary. On the other hand, if these were
transcribed as a single syllable (e.g. eyC), the task would remain to account for
why the first group of words sound different to the second group and if these are
phonetically as opposed to phonemically distinct.
There are two complex peaks in the following environments:
(i) There is an accented vowel I e/ and palatal glide followed by a voiced
consonant cluster, e.g. peybri [pefuri] 'clan name', eyrsida [eirsida] 'SgS moored
(Pf)'. Contrast with: neys [neys] 'two', peym [peym] 'dream', deyb [deyb]
'swelling, mound'.
(ii) There is a front accented vowel and bilabial glide followed by a consonant,
e.g. ewmida [eumida] 'SgS die (Pf)', gewm [geum] 'fear', iwri [iilri] - ewri [euri]
'SgS weave (Pf)', newr [neur] 'unmarried female', newd [neud] 'parrot fish',
ewsmeda [eusmeda] 'SgS come out (Pf)', ewtmer [eutmer] 'ask'. Contrast with:
new [new] 'ripe', Dew [dew] 'village name'.
(iii) There is an accented vowel and glide followed by a voiced consonant /r /,
e.g. toyr [t6ir] 'fat', gayr [gafr] 'many', wawr [waur] 'type of wind', bawr [baur]
'spear', teyr [tefr] 'decorated'. Contrast with: ays [ays] 'bring Pauc/PlO', Koyti
[k6yti] 'name of person', waw [waw] 'yes', Bawz [bawz] 'name of village', awmkep
[awmkep] 'type of cloud', aydir+aydir [aydir+aydir] 'lie Adj'.
The same data could be examined reaching the conclusion that a vowel
sequence is a valid analysis. Glides do share features with vowels and their12ability to become syllabic or maybe make the syllable sound longer is a
consequence of one such feature.
Arguments for considering the glides as underlying consonants.
(i)
There are only sequences of vowel plus glides or glides plus vowels within
the one syllable. Other vowel sequences always occur over two syllables with a
glide intervening although it may not be very prominant, e.g. kayed
'grandparent', keyar 'crayfish', eyu 'type of grass', iyu 'tears Instr', Mowa 'island
name'. Phonotactically, the glide occurs in a position typically occupied by a
consonant and thus, could be regarded as part of the consonant system.
(ii)
With some lexemes, there are examples of two glides and a vowel within
the one syllable:
syaw 'sneeze'
bway 'kinspeople'
way 'seed inside the coconut'
yey 'large blind shark'
waw 'yes, hole'
If glides are analysed as underlying vowels, then an account must be made
in the phonotactics of a possible sequence of three vowels- a somewhat unusual
phenomenon amongst languages of the world. If, however, the glides are
analysed as underlying consonants, then a sequence eve can be hypothesized- a
pattern which can be found elsewhere in the language.
The analysis of glides as consonants will still require further specification
in the phonotactic outline of the language because the only clusters that are
permitted word initially are those of a consonant plus glide type.
(iii)
Glides will have to be postulated to account for their use across morpheme
boundaries:
tutu-em-tutuw-em 'type of doll-all'
,
,
'tears-ms
• tr
1-u-1y-u
6+o-6w+o 'courageous' (lit: liver+liver)
le-em-ley-em-le-m 'person-all'
IThe decision as to whether glides are part of the consonant system or part
of the vowel system cannot be made at this stage of the analysis. More data and
evidence needs to be collected. In this analysis, glides will be presented as part of
the consonant system although this is only tentative.","[21, 22, 23, 24]"

2.4Adjectives.
The class of adjectives is somewhat problematic in terms of isolating its
members and determining what are its characteristics. The following words are
tentatively classed as adjectives: aw 'big, old', kebi 'little, young', debe 'good',
adud 'bad'. Also included in the adjective word class are the determiner/
demonstrative and quantifier words: able-ale 'determiner I demonstrative', netat
'one', nerut 'another', neys 'two', kep+kep 'few', wader 'several', mitkar 'alot',
gayr 'many'.
Criteria used for determining class membership is not based so much on
what they are as on what they are not. These words typically occur in a modifier
function (although they sometimes can occur as nouns). All words functioning
as adjectives precede the noun they modify or directly precede the existential/
locational verb:75(2.278) able kebi werem i ezo- Ii
Det little childS tear shed-Prlmpf
'The little boy is crying.'
(2.279) debe lag+lag
good want
'Nice flavour.'
(2.280) debe le
good person
'Good one!'
(2.281) wader koskir
several (married)female
'several women'
(2.282) nole ko
adud ike
Neg again bad n PIS be(thing)
'It does not matter.'
(lit: it is not bad (here) either)
Examples have been collected where adjectives are being used with a degree
function:
(2.283) e
aw-kaka kebi werem daIi
3SgS big-Intens little child n PIS be(person)-Primpf
'He is a very small child.'
In the above example, aw 'big' is not functioning as an adjective but as a
modifier of the adjective kebi 'little' to intensify it. (It would be pertinent to see
whether it can occur without the intensifier, e.g. ?e aw kebi werem dfili 'He is
slightly younger.')
In the two examples below (2.284 and 2.285), the reduplicated form is being
used with a distributive function:
(2.284) wi
netat+netat taba agud-em erer ba- krier
3n SgS one
3Gen god-. All shout PIS-cry out-n Prlmpf
'They cried out one by one to their god/They each cried out to their god.'
(2.285) able pazar tabara netat+netat ba- tager-da...
Det crews 3Gen one
Intr-tell- PWl
'The sailors said to each other.. .'
(Both of the above examples are from the manuscript of a biblical translation of
Jonah.)
Most words functioning as adjectives are derived from the noun word class
through a process of reduplication. Using Dixon's semantic types of adjectives
(1982), the following words in adjective function occur:761) dimension:
piri+piri 'long'
tewpay 'short'<piri 'length'
<tewpay 'shortness'
ex. tewpay-em 'for a short while'
<deg 'width'
<dob 'fatness'
<?toyrdeg+deg 'wide'
d6b+dob 'fat'
-toyr+toyr 'fat'
2) physical properties:

Several items functioning as adjectives are homophonous in form with
nouns. Should these simply be labelled 'nominals'? In such cases, there is no
morphological or syntactic evidence to suggest that there is any derivation
involved and thus, there is no justification for two word classes.
It remains to be checked whether the reduplicated form is possible at all
and/ or whether it intensifies its meaning:
?e tewpay+tewpay le 'he (is) a very short person'77?peret+peret wali 'very old clothes'
There are also some examples where the adjective can occur either
reduplicated or not (see also section on comparison with nominal compounds
p65):
(2.286) urweri ni
heat
water
'hot water, tea'
(2.287) aw-kaka urweri+urweri gerger pe ike
big-Intens heat Adj

'It is a really hot day today.'

overboard.'
(from the manuscript of the bible translation of Jonah)
(2.289) aw beber+beber werem daIi
big heavy Adj childS n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a very heavy child.'
The reader can note that the reduplicated form is associated with an
intensified meaning. It is not possible to say whether this meaning is obtained
from an adverbial function or a meaning that can be attributed to the
reduplicated form of the adjective. As this hypothesis was not considered during
fieldwork, no examples have been elicited to test it. The reduplicated form needs
to be tested for an attenuative meaning as well. The examples demonstrate the
possibility that reduplication can also be a semantic device.
Rigsby (p.c) suggests that the reduplicated form has a proprietive meaning
and gives as an example:
(2.290) tulik+tulik le
knife
person
'person with a knife'
No such examples were collected with the current corpus of data so no
comment can be made. However, there are examples where the associative case
has a proprietive meaning:
(2.291) mir- kem le
word-Ass person
'preacher' (lit: word-having person) (cf. 2.129)
(2.292) ged- kem le
land-Ass person
'land owner' (lit: land-having person) (cf. 2.130)78Of course, it may be that reduplication and the use of the associative suffixhave a general proprietive meaning with slight semantic differences between the
two.
There is one example in the data where a proprietive meaning is the only
interpretation possible and yet there is no reduplicated form nor the presence of
the associative suffix:
(2.293) ese ka no
if lSgS Restr
aw bakir le
wan(a)aIi...
big stone person RemPast-1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'H only I had had a lot of money.. .'
It would seem on the basis of the above example that a proprietive
meaning cannot be the sole function of the reduplicated form.
Some words always occur in a reduplicated form when functioning as
adjectives. Such is the case with colour terms, e.g. bam+bam 'yellow', where
reduplication is a signal of its function, i.e. a syntactic device, to mark a
derivational process. The two uses of reduplication are not necessarily
incompatible and there may be instances where syntactic uses and semantics
converge. More data will have to be collected to test such a claim.
Is there a basis for postulating a distinct word class of adjectives? For at
least a small closed class of words whose function is primarily to modify nouns,
an adjective category is appropriate. For other words operating in this function,
one can simply specify that they are nominals which for some will be
reduplicated to mark their adjectival function and for others, to mark intensity.","[84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]"
"291here are a number of existential/locational verbs whose choice is determined by
features such as animacy, shape and location of the subject.
Adjectives.
Adjectives are essentially a closed class. These include: aw 'big', kebi 'little,
young', debe 'good', adud 'bad'. Also included in this class are determiners and
quantifier words such as netat 'one', neys 'two', kep+kep 'few', wader 'several',
mitkar 'alot', gayr 'many'. As these items are the most representative of
adjectives cross-linguistically, it seems plausible that these are the basic adjectives
with others being derived from nouns or verbs. Words which function as
adjectives modify a noun in some way or are used attributively in a predicative
construction. Their position in the sentence is either before the noun which they
modif)j or preceding an existential verb when they are used with an ascriptive
function.
Pronouns.
Included in this class are personal, interrogative and indefinite pronouns.
Personal pronouns are a closed class of shifters. The interrogative and indefinite
pronouns differ from personal pronouns syntactically in that the former,
interrogatives and indefinites, inflect for case like nouns; the latter, personal
pronouns, inflect for case by opposing A/S to 0, i.e. on a nominative-accusative
pattern.
Adverbs.
Words in this class serve to modify the verb in some way either in
manner, e.g. dudum+dudum ""quickly"", or in time, e.g. mena 'continue, remain,
still', etc. They are a closed class of words but it is possible through derivation to
extend this class from other word classes. Adverbs do not bear any inflections
and occur in a position preceding the verb.
Deictic Markers.
This is a closed word class in which items occur as phonologically
independent units but do not constitute independent utterances by themselves.
Their forms are determined by the time of the event relative to the time of the
speech act utterance. Aspects of their meaning involve place, e.g. here/there;
time, e.g. now I then; referent, e.g. this one, that one; logical relations, e.g. but,
instead, what has been said, what is about to be said.
Clause Relators.
Items in this closed class serve to link two syntactic elements together.
These might be two phrases or two clauses (and in the case of the conjunction a,30this can also be two words). Little can be said about relators without a full study
of the types of clause linkage. There will be no discussion about them and they
are simply listed with an example of each in the chapter on basic syntax. Note
that deictic markers are also used in this category or rather exploited in this
category to link two syntactic units together.
Exclamations/Interjections.
Within this class of words are items which have no syntactic value and
which can occur as a complete utterance. Examples include waw 'yes', nole 'no',
way (-wey) 'alas, poor one, dear one', megiyem 'yuk' (lit: vomit-All), mayem
'welcome', erarem 'boring' (lit: tired-All), akame-akasi 'to express surprise,
incredulity', no bes mimi 'see you later' (lit: Restr lie wander), baru 'okay'. Items
in this class need not belong exclusively to this class. Thus, an item such as menaJ
which was discussed earlier as an adverb meaning 'keep on, remaining still', may
also be used as an interjection meaning 'hang on, wait'. This class will not be
discussed further.
Noun Morphology.
Nouns_, whether functioning as syntactic or local arguments of the verb,
must be suffixed with a case inflection. The choice of inflection is determined by
the case frame of the verb and the type of nominal; that is whether it is a
common or proper noun.","[40, 41, 42]"
"112Past-NonPresent.
There are too few occurrences in the current corpus of texts to claim with
any degree of certainty what is the precise meaning of these markers. The time
reference is clearly nonpresent:
(3.120) e
bakyamu- da able gerger-ge
3SgS Sg/DualS go-PfSg Det day- Loe
'He went earlier today.'
(3.121) *e
bakyamu- lu
able gerger-ge
3SgS Sg/DualS go-PastSg Det day- Loe
'He went earlier today.'
However, its most frequent occurrence is in texts with events that
happened a long time ago:

'He went (and) cut off another thing (bit of wood), saw it, carved it, went
to the water and immersed it but then he just threw it, threw it away.'
There is a contrast established between the nonpresent imperfective and
the past similar to that established between the nonpresent imperfective and the
future. The nonpresent imperfective indicates that the event was repeated
whereas the past indicates that it was only a single realisation of the event, i.e.
semelfactive. Contrast the example given above (where the speaker is talking
about one particular item of wood being cut, floated and thrown away) with that
following (taken from the same story), where a number of pieces of wood are
taken, thrown into the water to see if they floated and then, thrown away:
(3.124) e

out-All throw Pauc/PIO-n Primpf
'He went (and) carved things (bits of wood), he cut off light things, threw
them into the water (and) they then floated on the surface (so) he threw
them away.'
In addition, the past does not appear to carry any particular aspectual
meaning as when it is used at the end of a story (where it would tend to be
perfective), speakers reject it. The first example below (3.125) is an excerpt from a
text with the past form used and the second example (3.12G) is an elicited one to
see if the story could be suitably ended with it. It is dubious whether such data is
conclusive although it is suggestive:
(3.125) able neys le

'The two of them changed, became castaways (and) thus swam until they
reached Ne.. .' (Dewmer, p209, section8)
(3.126) ?...ewdim ba- rb- ey .
thus
Intr-punt-PastDual
'... they thus swam.'
One speaker described the distinction between the perfective and the past as
the former being more recent and the latter more distant in time to that of the
speech act:
(3.127) e
ekwey- dari ad- em digm-i
(immediate past)
3SgS stand up-PfSg out-All walk-Pf
'He stood up and walked off.'
(3.128) e
ekwey- lu
ad- em digem-0
(recent past)
3SgS stand up-PastSg out-All walk- Past
'He stood up and walked off.'
Thus it may be that the distinction between perfective and past is a
distinction between immediate and recent past. Furthermore, the fact that some
speakers do not allow the past to be used with events that happened yesterday
suggests that distant past time is a valid category. However, examples in texts
where the perfective and the past are used need to be accounted for as one would
expect either one tense or the other to be used. Alternatively, it may be that an
114association does exist between the perfective and immediate past, with speakers
preferring more recent events to be specified overtly for aspect but no such
restriction existing for more distant events. The meaning of the past-nonpresent
marker cannot be fully elucidated from the available material.
In Kalaw Lagaw Ya, there is a distinction in the verbal forms between
immediate past, recent past and remote past (Ford and Ober, 1987; 27). This could
correspond to the perfective, past and remote past categories postulated for
Meryam.
Irrealis Non-committal.
This marker is used for events where their realisation or continuation is
uncertain. It is also used sometimes by speakers to be polite, not wishing to
assume that an event, involving the addressee, definitely will (continue to)
happen. It is restricted to events with 2nd or 3rd person participants since these
are potentially less certain than events with the speaker, i.e. 1st person, which are
more certain (at least from the speaker's point of view) and cannot carry an
irrealis non-committal mood. When this mood is used, there is often an
additional component of desire on behalf of the speaker or of someone else in
wanting the event to (continue to) happen and that the event will be good.
Consider the following examples contrasting future with irrealis:
(3.129) debe le
nole inner-kak wa- yrdi

daw0
able kerim bakir awskir- em

(3.130) debe le

daw(w)a able kerim bakir awskir- em

(translation given by the speaker)
(3.131) ma ut nawpe

'Remain sleeping.'
(3.132) ma ut
nawpe
daw- (w)a
2SgS sleep 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS lien PIS be-Irr
'Could you please remain asleep.'
In these examples, there is a contrast between the future (3.129 and 3.131)
and irrealis (3.130 and 3.132) with regard to the speaker's attitude. In the irrealis,
the speaker indicates his/her desire for the event to happen or continue
happening. In 3.132, the irrealis indicates the speaker's desire to be polite in not115wanting to say whether the event will happen or not although it is dear from the
context that the speaker wants the event to happen and thinks it will be good.
The irrealis examples can be tentatively explicated as follows:
I don't want to say it will happen/ go on happening
I don't want to say it won't happen/won't go on happening
I can't do it or stop it happening
(I want- you want- other people want something)
(I think- you think- other people think it will be good)
In some examples, the event is both desired by and beneficial to the
speaker:
(3.133) ese ka nole na- kyam- lu 3 klok wa- yrpeyo,
if 1SgS Neg Futl-wake up-Futl <Eng Fut3-grab Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
ma- ge kari natirwa
2SgA-Deix 1Sg01/2Sg0-wake up-Irr
'If I am not awake (when) 3 o'clock strikes, then you should wake me up.'
In some examples, the event is desired only by the speaker but beneficial to
the addressee:
(3.134) ma kari-m wit

to stay clear in case the blade might fly off.)

'If you go in the morning, go and should you strike something which
makes the sound 'pi', that is the one, cut it.'
(This example was said by an old woman to someone in their dream to
help them find the right bit of wood.)
In some examples, the event is neither beneficial nor desired by the speaker
or addressee but by another person (such as in the phrase below ese legize mari
bawru onaskawem 'if people should try and spear you' where the spearing is
desired and would benefit only the spearers, not the speaker nor addressee):

'Go, dive in (and) stay there in the deep sea. H people should try to spear
you with their spear, then you should try and break their spear.'
(This was said by a mother to her child urging him to dive into the water
and break the spears of those who try and spear him.)
In the following example, the event is neither beneficial nor desirable for
the speaker, only for the addressee:
(3.137) wa

2n SgS Qclitic-thing-Abl
wa
baka lar dipomde daw(w)a?
2n SgS go fishO feel
n Pl?S be(person)-Irr
'Why should you go fondling the fish?'
(where the speaker is addressing a group of women that he asked to help
him cook a fish but does not want them to know that the fish is a young
boy)In this example, the irrealis marker is used as a kind of warning. The
speaker does not want to say that the event is happening and so, he uses the
irrealis marker. This illustrates another important feature of the irrealis marker.
The irrealis is never used with yes/no questions nor non-polar interrogatives as
the presupposition in the speaker's mind is that something will happen or is
happening. Thus, below, in 3.138, the speaker assumes the addressee is staying
for a while and is asking for more information about the period of the stay. It
would be inappropriate to use the irrealis marker suggesting that the addressee
was not staying. Similarly in the other example below, 3.139, the speaker must be
thinking that there is some suggestion or possibility that the addressee will be
staying and so the irrealis marker would imply the converse:
(3.138) ma nanyay+nyay i

2SgS Q clitic-long time N Deix 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS be(person)-Fut2/3 M.- Loe

hey 2SgS Deix 1/2Sg/P1S-n PIS be(person)-Fut2/3 M.- Loe
'Will you be staying on Murray Island?'
*aka ma i n-aw-(w)a Mer-ge?
When the irrealis marker is used with reference to 2nd person, it is
frequently used as a politeness form. Speakers often explain such sentences as the
speaker giving permission to the addressee, i.e. any time you like do it. It is
probably for this reason that the irrealis marker has been described by Ray as the
117form of the imperative used when the speaker will be absent. When it is being
used as a form of politeness, the time reference is not specified for the immediate
and hence interpretation of its meaning in terms of the speaker's absence is
plausible and accounted for. Here are some examples of its use as a politeness
form:
(3.140) ma mena naw(w)a
2SgS still 1/2Sg/PIS-n PIS be(person)-Irr
'Do stay here/ You should stay longer/ You could stay longer.'
(often used by speakers as a polite way of bidding farewell)
(3.141) ma nami

2SgS 1 /2Sg/PIS-n PIS be sitting n PIS be(person)-Irr
'Do stay seated.'
(3.142) ma marl ged- ge naw(w)a,

ma- ga si
temarik-wa ged- im
2SgA-Deix fond thoughtO Deix-send- Irr land-All
'Should you be (back) in your country, could you send (us) your good
thoughts.'
A feature of the irrealis marker which warrants further investigation is the
frequent occurrence with conditional sentences, both in the condition and the
consequent. Is the irrealis marker used to indicate a lesser degree of certainty? Is
it used to indicate an overt lack of commitment to its realisation on behalf of the
speaker? If one compares sentences with and without the irrealis, the contrast lies
in the degree of certainty of the events:
(3.143) nade ma abi erdar-0,
ma abi detager-0
when 2SgA 3Sg0 see- Fut2/3 2SgA 3Sg0 tellFut2/3
'When you see him, tell him.'
(3.144) ese ma abi erdar-0,

if 2SgA 3Sg0 see- Fut2/3 2SgA 3Sg0 tellFut2/3
'If you see him, you tell him.'
(3.145) ese ma abi erdar-wa, ma abi detager-wa
if 2SgA 3Sg0 see- Irr 2SgA 3Sg0 tellIrr
'If you should see him, you could tell him.'
*nade ma abi erdar-wa, ma abi detager-wa
The incompatibility of the temporal phrase marker nade 'when' and the
irrealis noncommittal suggests it does indeed carry a lesser degree of certainty. It
may also be suggesting that the speaker does not want to say whether something
will happen or not. This interpretation of the irrealis noncommittal is supported
by non-conditional sentences with 3rd person where the irrealis noncommittal
marker indicates that the speaker will not say whether something will happen or
not:118(3.146) e

'He will still sit down there and stay there and may well (still) be sitting
down there (well after the time you and me are gone or when he is a

Note that with this example, it does not seem pertinent to include whether
the speaker I addressee/ other person wants this to happen or thinks it will be
good. For this reason, the two extra components of the explication given are
optional.
Past lrrealis.
The past irrealis marker is formed by the co-occurring morphemes of the
prefix wa- and the perfective suffix. It is used for counterfactuals, i.e. to indicate
that something which could have happened, did not.

'She thought that the Warib mob would have given her some fish, they
had not given her any (because) they did not like her.'
Would one want to gloss the prefix wa- for future 3rd person the same as
for past irrealis? Such glossing would be misleading as the prefix in the future is
restricted to 3rd person, whereas it is not the case for the past irrealis:119(3.149) ka bakyamu- da abi wa- yrdar-i
lSgS Sg/DualS go-Pf 3Sg0 Pastlrr-see- PfSg
'I went to see him (but did not get to see him).'
Would one want to gloss the past irrealis as a discontinuous morpheme
involving prefix and suffix? The same conclusions reached about the future still
hold in so far as the prefix and suffix can occur independently of each other and it
is the combination of the prefix and suffix which gives it its particular meaning as
the past irrealis (although it can also be used to indicate the remote past, but see
the section below). Unlike the future use of the prefix which was restricted to 3rd
person, there are no person constraints.
Remote Past.
The remote past is used to mark events that happened a long time ago. It
represents a broad temporal category and aspectual meanings are conveyed by a
combination of the prefix wa- and various suffixes.
The remote past is marked by the prefix and the past suffix:
(3.150) abkorep e
wet- eper-e
former-type 3SgS RemPast-Deix-fly- PastSg
'Like before, she flew (to the place).' (D6pem, p217, section15)
The remote past imperfective is marked by the prefix and the present
(imperfective) suffixes:
wayke-li
(3.151) able tonar e
Det habitO 3SgA RemPast-do- Primpf
'She did (it) this way.' (D6pem, p217, section15)
yrdi(redi)
(3.152) able tonar waDet habitS RemPast-n PIS be(time, place)-Pr
'The same thing happened (there).' (D6pem, p217, section14)
The remote past perfective is marked by the prefix and the perfective suffix:
ta- bakamuda wegimu- da
(3.153) ebur waanimal RemPast-Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg RemPast-land- PfSg
wepigeme- da

foodO RemPast-Deix-carry pauc/ plO-Pf
'The bird came, landed, changed; (as) a woman, (she) went there and took
all the food.' (D6pem, p217, section15)
There is no past irrealis in the remote past or rather there is no distinction
between the remote past perfective and the past irrealis. Such a collapse is
understandable if one considers that events in the remote past are so distant in120time that it is not possible to comment on what might or could have happened.
For this reason, the past irrealis mood is redundant and the marker is used to
signal remote past perfective.
The reader should not assume from the description of the remote past that
it is a tense used frequently. In fact, it is probably falling into disuse with speakers
preferring the more recent tenses even in narratives concerned with events in
the remote past. Only one text was collected in which the remote past was used
throughout a story and even then, there was a switch half-way to the past:

'One old woman, she was living at Dopem .... Afterwards, they thought
about her .. .' (D6pem, p215, sectionl)
Most narratives involving events which happened a long time ago begin
the story with the remote past and then switch immediately to the past:
(3.155) netat gerger-ge, eypu koki
kerker-ge, netat kimyar

'One day, in the middle of the monsoon season, a man and his daughter
whose name was Dewmer, were out fishing in their sailboat outside of
Mabyog... ' (Dewmer, p208, section2)
The Relation between the various uses of the morpheme wa-.
Why should it be the same prefix wa- recurring in these functions: i.e
future 3rd person, past irrealis, remote past? There is a thread binding all these
together. The future is often realised in many languages as the irrealis mood
because events concerned with the future are, by their very nature, uncertain.
Thus, there is a link between the future and the irrealis. In Meryam, future
events involving 3rd person may be the least certain events because the
participant is frequently absent from the speech act place and it involves someone
which neither speaker nor addressee have direct control over. Given that 3rd
person future expresses the greatest degree of uncertainty, it is the same121morpheme which is used to express past irrealis events and those so far removed
in time that they could be regarded as irrealis events themselves.
Why should the past irrealis and remote past be more closely related in
meaning to the 3rd person future marker than the irrealis noncommittal? The
irrealis noncommittal is concerned with the attitude of the speaker: I don't want
to say this will happen, I don't want to say this won't happen. In Meryam, such
an attitude is inappropriate with the past, be it irrealis or remote, as it deals with
events that have already happened or events that should or could have
happened but did not occur. The speaker would be essentially saying: I know
what happened but I don't want to say. Such a meaning is not part of the
message when the past irrealis or remote past are used and consequently, the
irrealis noncommittal is unsuitable for past (realised or non-realised) events.
Nonetheless, the forms of the future 3rd marker and that of the irrealis
noncommittal are clearly related, the unmarked/singular form of the latter being
homophonous with the former. These can probably be traced to a single
historical source. The different functions of the prefix/ suffix wa, i.e. irrealis
noncommittal, past irrealis, remote past and 3rd person future, are linked
together as they all deal in one way or another about what the speaker thinks is or
wants to say is the degree of certainty of the event's realisation.
3.8.3 Inherent Aspectual Features of Verbs.
Apart from the distinction of atelic stative from telic active verbs on
semantic and morphological grounds, there has been an implicit assumption
throughout the discussion on the meaning and function of temporal/ aspectual/
mood markers that all verbs can be affixed with these markers in order to yield a
meaning directly transparent to the verb root's meaning and the inflection.
Such a view is an over-simplification for it fails to account for the interaction
between verbs' meanings and inflections.
A number of verbs have an inherently punctiliar meaning, that is they are
all events that have no duration. Verbs in this semantic class include ewmi 'die',
baraygi 'Sg/DualS dive in', baw 'Sg/DualS go in'. Also included in this class are
verbs which involve a specific number such as erapey 'buy Sg/DualO', igared
'take animate Sg/DualO', etaruk 'pick up Sg/DualO', etaker 'gather up Pauc/PlO'.
Some of these verbs are not readily affixed with markers conveying a durative
meaning. Sometimes, such a meaning can only be conveyed periphrastically:
(3.156) kara
ama
ewd- em eke-Ii
lSgGen mothers dieN-All do?-PrlmpfSg
'My mother is dying.'
*kara ama ewmi-li
die- Prlmpf122For some verbs, only a related paucal/plural form that is indefinite in
number (or possibly generic in meaning) can be associated with durativity or
iterativity:
(3.157) able uteb- ge pe- ka
digwatIi...
Det place-Loe Deix-1SgA pull in Pauc/Pl fish-PrlmpfSg
'The place (where) I fish .. .'
*able uteb-ge pe-ka digwatmuIi
pull in Sg/Dual fish
The speaker is not saying that he catches many fish at that place nor that he
has caught many fish there. What is being conveyed is that it is the place
associated with a particular activity done at frequent intervals, namely fishing.
With some verbs, a semi-productive morpheme dar- must be used to allow
a non-punctiliar associated meaning of the verb (See end of chapter on NonProductive Derivations, p142):
(3.158) e
b(a)- ada(r)-li
3SgS Intr- put in Sg/DualO-?PrlmpfSg
'He is coming out.'
(3.159) ka mir
atrumda(r)-li
1SgA wordO suggest Sg/DualO-?- PrimpfSg
'I am suggesting something.'
Not all verbs can be affixed with this morpheme to produce such a
meaning:
(3.160) *e
ewpamada(r)-li
3SgS Sg/DualS jump-?PrlmpfSg
'He is jumping.'
..re ewpamaret-li
Pauc/PlS jump
For a number of verbs, temporal/ aspectual markers are exploited lexically
in order to derive a related but slightly different meaning. Thus, durative
marking on a punctual verb such as ewmi 'die' produces a different lexeme in
Meryam meaning 'ache, wither'. Similarly, a punctiliar verb such as igared 'take
Sg/DualO animate' can produce a different lexeme when a durative inflection is
suffixed, namely 'be living with Sg/DualO animate in a defacto relationship':
(3.161) kara

There are many people who must be thanked for their help. First and
foremost is the Murray Island Council who permitted me to come and live on
their island. All the people on Murray made me feel so welcome and I found
many new friends. I really need to thank everyone, from all the villages, from
Webok to Babud. Each and everyone contributed in one way or another and
taught me so much with diligence, patience and humour. The teaching sessions
often did not happen in formal sessions but when I was going for walks, at the
shops, having cups of tea, camping or picnicing at Dawar, spending time in
people's homes. To all those people, thank-you. To Les Saleee, his wife,
Maryann (Kosir), and their children, Galiga and Kinor, whom I lived with for all
those months and who became my dear family, thank-you. To all my other
relatives at Dew, thank-you. A special thanks to Tapim Binifather, Gamalai Passi
and Kathleen Salee who gave up their time to answer all my nit-picking queries,
helped me decipher texts and taught me more about their language. I would also
like to thank all those that allowed me to record stories: Henry Kaberi, Gracie
Barsa, Kaba Noah and his wife, James Rice, Eidiana Tabo, Meb Salee, Sam Passi
and many others. To each and everyone of you, 'big eso'.

The type of cross-referencing marking for 3rd person may be predictable on
the basis of whether the verb carries a temporal marker or not. If the verb carries
its own temporal marking, it also carries a distinction between paucal and plural;
if the verb does not carry its own temporal marking, it does not distinguish
between paucal and plural. Such a hypothesis needs to be tested against a large
corpus of intransitive atelic verbs.
(3.177) wiRules of allomorphy for all types of verbs.
na- (associated withl/2person for number)
When verb roots begin with (a consonant and) an unaccented vowel, the
consonant and vowel are deleted and the marker na- '1 /2person number' is
prefixed:
--> 0 Ina+ ex. na-tager (<detager) 'tell l/2Sg0'
#(d)V[-accent]
na-mi (<imi) 'l/2Sg/DualS be sitting'
na- (associated with 3rd person for number)
When verb roots begin with a consonant andan,unaccented vowel, the
marker na- '3rd pers number' is infixed in the form -ra- following the vowel.
Note that there is vowel harmony as well between the initial vowel of the verb
root and the vowel of the morpheme:
#dV + na
ex. da-ra-kmerik (<dikmerik) 'put to rest upon
something DualO'
H the verb root begins with an unaccented vowel only, this vowel is deleted
and the marker is prefixed/infixed (depending on whether one chooses to delete
the vowel first and then prefix the marker or whether one chooses to infix the
marker and then delete the vowel):
#V + na ---> 0 + na
ex. na-pit (<ipit) 'hit 3n SgO'
Number/Person Markers For 0 by Prefixes.
Prefixes affixed to transitive verbs cross-reference the number of the 0
argument. The following table shows the full range of forms and functions:Person:

3Number:

na-nonsingular0-na-d-127Note that the prefixes are the same forms as those for intransitive atelic
verbs. However, they have singular versus nonsingular number reference for all
persons. Here are some examples to illustrate their use:

However, the table fails to capture the fact that dual, paucal and plural 0
number can be overtly specified by means of suffixes following the number
hierarchy (see later section on number hierarchy, p132). One can either regard the
prefix as a co-occurring morpheme or as a more general non-singular number
marker. For example:
(3.182) e

although as mentioned in the previous section, consonant plus glide clusters can
occur word-initially, and glide plus consonant clusters can occur word-finally.
The types of consonant clusters which can occur in word-medial position
are not restricted and gaps in their occurrence are likely to be due to the paucity of
data rather than actual restrictions. This apparent freedom in cluster types is the
result of nouns and verbs formed into complex stems, processes such as
reduplication and vowel deletion with certain conjugations and affixation of
certain morphemes. The examples given in the section on syllables indicated
that an analysis which relies on the occurrence of phoneme sequences alone, i.e.
a phonotactic study, will fail to predict why some consonant clusters are
acceptable whilst others are not (such as consonant clusters at word boundaries).
It was suggested that a closer examination of the internal structure of the syllable
might be a more profitable way of looking at the data. An alternative approach
would be to examine whether clusters differ within a word root as opposed to at a
morpheme boundary. It is not always, however, apparent where the root
boundaries are.
This study will restrict itself to giving examples and listing the consonant
clusters that have been collected.
The basic phonotactic structure of a word is as follows:
(C1)V(CC2V)(C3t
where
V=any vowel
u 'coconut (tree)'
e '3SgA/S'
i 'tears', deictic marker
a conjunction
o 'liver'
Cl= all consonants (glides are included in this category) can occur word initiallyexcept /r/
One word has been collected starting with /r/ namely rom 'type of dark
cloud which appears out at sea'. However, this word only appears in a song and
may have been borrowed from Kalaw Lagaw Ya or some other language.

"Previous Research on the Language.
Earlier work on Meryam has been limitgd in quantity and quality. In 1893,
Ray and Haddon published a study of vocabularies and grammatical notes drawn
from various missionaries', explorers' and researchers' notes. Unfortunately, the
study is subject to the contributors' spelling idiosyncracies, e.g. 'Maer' for Mer, to
interpretations of the sort: 'I think the variation of initial vowel is only due to
the influence of individual choice', and to dubious meanings because of personal
beliefs, e.g. omare 'mercy'.
The most extensive study is that of Ray (1907) which provides some 40
pages of grammar, 30 pages of vocabulary and 30 pages of texts. Such a study
provides the opportunity to compare earlier and later forms of the grammar.
A more recent work was undertaken by Bartos (1977), who provides a
preliminary study of the sounds of the language, and a paper by McConvell (1983};
who examines ergativity and verb agreement in the language to demonstrate that
Meryam cannot be said to be fully ergative or accusative in its system.
In addition, there are a number of primary sources such as texts produced
by Meryam students at the School of Australian Linguistics in the newsletter
Ngali and field notes kindly made available by Rigsby.",[14]
"1243.9Person and Number Cross-Reference Markers.
The forms of some cross-reference markers have already been encountered
elsewhere in the section on the structure of the verb and its tense/aspect/mood
markers. In this section, we will examine the forms and functions of markers
cross-referencing S in intransitive atelic stative verbs, 0 in transitive telic verbs
and S/ A in intransitive and transitive telic verbs.
The function and scope of cross-reference markers is predictable on the
basis of their position or slot within the verb complex. Prefixes essentially crossreference Sand 0 for person and number. Suffixes essentially cross-reference S
and A for number although there is a number hierarchy in operation for
transitive verbs in which A and 0 compete for number marking. Alternatively,
the number suffixes can be regarded as cross-referencing any syntactic argument
with restrictions imposed by the number hierarchy with transitive verbs.
Number/Person Markers for S of Intransitive Atelic Verbs.
Prefixes affixed to intransitive atelic verbs cross-reference the number and
to some degree the person of the S argument. The following table shows the full
range of forms and functions:Person:
1/2
3Number:
singular /plural
na-dual/paucal0-na-Number:
singular
0-d-nonsingular
na-The generalizations can be captured by saying that there is an opposition
between 1/2 and 3rd person in the forms and functions. There are two different
types of cross-reference marking for 3rd person (plural). One type contrasts the
dual/paucal with the singular/plural whilst the other type contrasts singular
with non-singular; in other words, the two types differ only in their number
reference not in their forms. When the S involves an inanimate noun, the crossreference marking tends to be singular versus nonsingular and there is typically
no distinction in either the form of the verb root or in the cross-reference
marking between the paucal and plural form. When the S involves an animate
noun (typically human or high animate beings like dogs), the type of crossreference marking is unpredictable and verbs can be of either type.
Although the 0- form is given for ease of reference in the table, it is not
given in the morpheme by morpheme glosses as it is regarded as the unmarked125form. Examples to illustrate the possibilities for the cross-reference markers are
presented with the verbs imi- 'Sg/DualS be sitting' and emr- 'Pauc/PlS be sitting':
(3.166) ka namiredi

To illustrate the other type of cross-reference marking with 3rd person
contrasting singular versus nonsingular, consider the following examples with
the verbs azirk- 'Sg/DualS be inserted' and azig- 'PIS be inserted':
(3.173) kara

These are the only examples collected of this type suggesting a semiproductive process. It could be more appropriate to list them directly in the
lexicon as compound lexemes.
Comparison with Adjectives.
It was mentioned in the introduction that compounds, be they listed as
lexemes or produced through a productive process, share comparable and
diverging features with adjectives.
Similarities between these two groups have been alluded to above. It was
seen that the compound types frequently exhibit the pattern in which Nl
provides more information about N2. Adjectives which precede the noun they
modify fulfil a similar function because they too provide additional information
about the referent of the noun. In formal terms, the Nl of a compound and
adjectives both precede the head noun and both fulfil a modifier-type function.
However, most adjectives are derived from nouns by a process of
reduplication whereas nouns in a compound structure do not undergo such a
derivational process (see the section on Adjectives, p75).
There are a number of examples in the data which contrast a modifying
noun and a modifying adjective. Consider:
(2.226) ni

(2.227) ni+ni

'boiled doughboys'
(2.228) ur bi

'overripe mango'
(i.e. one which has been lying on the ground for several days)
Semantic differences between the two types are not easily captured.
Wierzbicka (1988) when discussing differences between nouns and adjectives
makes the claim that nouns 'identify a certain kind of person, a kind of thing, a
kind of animal (Ibid; 469) ...endowed with certain properties; whereas adjectives
designate properties as such (and more specifically what is seen as) a single
property' (Ibid; 472). Whilst her explanation has been formulated to capture
differences between independent nouns and adjectives, it does seem that her
comments are pertinent to the differences between a modifying noun in a
compound and an adjective. In compounds, the first noun often provides
information which identifies the kind of referent it is, whereas adjectives provide
information concerning a particular property of the referent.
Givon (1984; 51) in his account of the differences between independent
nouns and adjectives provides a semantic explanation which seems to partly
capture the difference between modifying nouns and adjectives. His claim is that
nouns refer to the most stable conditions, adjectives to intermediate states (as
opposed to verbs which are events of most rapid change). With compounds, the
modifying noun often refers to a permanent and inherent quality of the head
noun, whereas with adjectives, it is often an impermanent quality and often the
result of a process.
Neither approach satisfactorily distinguishes between modifying nouns
and adjectives. However, neither Wierzbicka nor Givon formulated their ideas
in order to account for modifying nouns although features such as 'the kind of
thing' and 'permanence' capture some of the differences. A language which
heavily exploits such a distinction can contribute in refining and modelling these
semantic claims.

DEICTIC MARKERS4.1.. ,IIIntroduction.
There is a closed class of markers grouped together on a semantic basis as
their meaning is dependent and relative to a place, time, referent or proposition.
They can be regarded as deictic markers because they are 'aspects of the
interpretation of sentences that relate to the speech act situation' (Fillmore, 1975;
8). In Meryam Mir, this is reflected in the choice of marker being determined by
the time at which the event or state happens or is happening relative to the time
of the speech act itself.
It is unclear whether the deictic markers are words or not. They may or may
not carry an accent. Their distribution in the sentence is equally unclear. They
always follow the first element in a sentence and they nearly always occur before
the verb in a clause. They never occur in isolation but always in conjunction
with a verb which suggests they do not have independent grammatical status. In
most examples, the deictic markers can be omitted without altering the
grammatical status although there is obviously a change in meaning. Thus, the
main functional load is on their meaning rather than their syntactic role.
Their status and grammatical function will be discussed following a
description of their forms, features and pragmatic/semantic function. However,
several points should be made before the description:
(i) Examples have been drawn mainly from texts or casual conversation as
elicitation proved to be unsuccessful though desirable for testing certain claims.
One of the consequences of such an approach is that there are major gaps in the
data and not all meanings are contrasted.
(ii) The glosses and free translations reflect the analysis of the researcher rather
than informants' translations as they rarely gave any translation for the markers
other than a spatial meaning and in some of the examples, such a translation was
clearly inadequate.
(iii) A number of features are given for each deictic marker which may prove in
the light of further research to be irrelevant in establishing the contrast between
them. Nonetheless these features have been included to make the treatment of
each marker as extensive as possible.
(iv) There is variation amongst speakers as to the appropriate or suitable marker
to be used. Some speakers actually 'correct' the form of the marker used by
another speaker, which suggests the deictic system is in a state of flux. Speakers
do have choices depending on the perspective they wish to take and particular
features which determine the choice of marker for one speaker may not be the146same prominent features which determine the choice for another speaker. In
other words, a certain amount of variation within the system may be the result of
ongoing changes.
(v) The analysis presented below is by no means final but represents a working
hypothesis based on the current corpus of data. Further study in the area may
result in considerable changes.
In the table on the next page, the deictic markers can be distinguished from
one another on the basis of temporal restrictions and domain of applicability. The
table is an attempt to capture,not function~ but differences and similarities. Note
that the gaps in the system may be because of limited data or because the temporal
reference is too distant from the present and thus distinctions are lost, i.e. there
are no markers for goal and source in the remote past and future. Below is a
summary of the deictic markers' functions..jSummary of Deictic Markers' Functions:

The present deictic markers pe and pa contrast with the non-present
markers ge and ga. Whilst the former can only be used with events or states
which coincide with the speech act utterance or precede it at a time earlier on the
same day, the latter are used with events or states which occur prior to the day or
following the utterance. To illustrate this contrast, consider the examples below.
In 4.1, reference is made to a location marked by the form ge when it is associated
with events or states that occurred a day earlier to the speech act (abgergerge
'yesterday') and by the form pe when it is associated with events that occurred
prior to the speech act (able idimge 'this morning'). Although reference is being
made to the same location, different forms must be used to demonstrate the
different time reference. Similarly, in 4.2, one group of fish caught the previous
day is contrasted with a group of fish caught earlier in the day:

(Note that the markers that concern us here are not the case inflections suffixed to
nominals which in some cases are homophonous with the deictic markers,
e.g. -ge locative inflection: abgerger-ge 'yesterday-loc'. Those that are deictic
markers are clearly labelled as such. In addition, the reader should not get
confused with verbal deictics and non-verbal deictics. These can be distinguished
from one another on the basis that verbal deictics always occur prefixed to the
verb. The deictic markers in this discussion concern the non-verbal ones.)

The alternation between the plural endings -darda and -da are determined
by the verb's paradigm. If the singular form of the same root ends in -da(ri),
the plural form will be -darda. If the singular form ends in -i, the plural form
will be-da.
The morpheme -i has been labelled singular /plural for number as it can be
suffixed to indicate either number with intransitive verbs. However, knowledge
of the full verbal paradigm, the form of the related root as determined by numbelj
and the marker itself, all combine to give its specific number reference:
(3.206) able nar ba- ytr- i
Det boatS Intr-sink-Pf
'The boat sank.'
(Contrast with the plural form that involves the same root form plus the plural

paucal suffix: able le b6s-idere lokotlam 'Several people came out from the bush.'
and the singular I dual number which will involve a different but related verb
root: able le ewsme-da lokotlam 'That person came out from the bush.')
With transitive verbs, the marker -i always indicates that the A argument
is singular:

"General rules for allomorphic variations:
An accented front, high vowel /i/ followed immediately by a consonant
becomes a glide (w-y) when a morpheme is prefixed:
1. i[ +accent]
-> y I wa + ex. wa-ytmer (<itmer) 'Fut3 ask';
2. i[ +accent]wa-ype (<ipe) 'Fut3 SgS be lying'
--> y I morpheme + - c 1 iex. d-a-ymi-lu (<dimi) 'Futl close SgO'
ba-ymi-da 'Intr Sg S be closed'
3. i[ +accent]

ba-wski-da 'Intr SgS be open'
d-a-wg-e (<dig) 'Futl open PIO'
ba-wg-da 'Intr PIS be open'
d-a-wm-e (<dim) 'Futl close PIO'
ba-wm-da 'Intr PIS be closed'
(Rules 1. and 2. have to apply before rule 3.)
Contrast these with accented vowels other than /i/ which are not affected
by the above rules:
ex. n(a)- abger-i (<dabger) 'call out 1/2Sg0 Pf'
n(a)-akome-lu (<akomer) 'FutlSg return'
na-ydi-lu (<eydi) 'FutlSg lie down'
Note that the above rules do not affect the accent) which remains on the

-->no- I -b692ba- (all homophonous forms)
When the verb root commences with (a consonant and) an unstressed
vowel, these are deleted and the marker ba- is prefixed. When the verb root
commences with (a consonant and) a stressed vowel, the consonant is deleted
and the vowel is reduced to a glide or deleted or remains the same, and the prefix
is affixed. The rules for predicting the accented form when it is /i/, are covered by
the general rules for allomorphic variations outlined above. Thus:
ba + (C) V[-accent] --> ba + 0
ex. ba-taperet 'growl each other' (<etaperet)
ba-saw 'rub each other' (<desaw)

ex. ba-wski (intr.vb.) 'be open' (<diski tr.vb.)
ba-ymi (intr.vb.) 'be closed' (<dimi tr.vb.)Problems of shift of stress-accent.
The problem of shift in the stress-accent remains to be described. As stated
earlier, pitch-accent occurs on either the first or the second syllable. Inflected
forms of the verb retain the pitch-accent in the same position. For example, the
verb detager 'tell' has the pitch-accent on the second syllable and the pitch-accent
will remain in that position when inflected, e.g. wa-ditager 'Fut3 tell' (e--->i I
+accent). However, when the initial root vowel becomes a glide with the future
morpheme wa-, the accent seems to always fall on the first syllable, e.g. isim 'cut
Pauc/PlO' ---> wa-ysim 'Fut3 cut Pauc/PlO'. One possible explanation is that the
shift to first syllable position is parallel to first syllable accented verbs. For the
latter verbs, the initial root vowel becomes a glide when there are prefixes, in the
same way that initial root vowels of some verbs become glides with the
morpheme wa- (see the section on allomorphs of wa-, pl 12). This area clearly
requires more detailed work.
lntransitiviser.
The morpheme ba- forms intransitive verbs from transitive verbs. It is a
fully productive morpheme often making the action reflexive, i.e. both A and 0
---> S:
b(a)-aw
'Sg/DualS go in'
aw
'put in Sg/DualO'
b(a)-arot
'Pauc/PIS go in'
a rot
'put in Pauc/PlO'
ba-rmisir 'prepare oneself'
dirmisir
'prepare'
ereb
'punt'
ba-reb
'swim'
etawrik
'go around something' ba-tawrik 'turn around, change direction'
It is the morpheme productively used to signal reciprocal relationships:
detager
'tell'
ba-tager
'talk to each other'
ba-taperet 'growl each other'
'growl'
etaperet3.593tag ba-wgwat 'shake each other's hand'
tag digwat 'shake hands'
ba-rap
'buy each other Pauc/PlO'
erap
'buy Pauc/PlO'
ba-res
'beat each other up'
eres
'beat up'
It is also used when the 0 argument of the transitive verb becomes the S
argument of the intransitive verb, i.e. 0 ---> S:
disirik
'light'
ba-sirik
'start to become alight'
etkir
'erase'
ba-tkir
'fade'
'immerse'
'sink'
iter
ba-yter
dimi
'n PIS become closed'
ba-ymi
'close Sg/DualO'
diski
ba-wski
'n PIS become open'
'open Sg/DualO'
The intransitiviser morpheme permits constructions where the verb
signals the end point of a change of state:
(3.46) ka able lu- tam
erapeyda
1SgA Det thing-branchO break Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I broke the branch.'
(3.47) able lu- tam
ba- rap- da
Det thing-branchS Intr-break-PfSg
'The branch has (become) broken.'
(The absence of number distinction in the verb root for the intransitive form
should be ignored as it is also possible to use this same form of the verb root in
the transitive construction with a singular 0.)
However, the reader must not assume that the presence of /ba/ in a verb
automatically signals an intransitiviser. There is a homophonous morpheme
that marks the plural number of S, e.g. ekyam 'wake', ba-kyam 'Pl S wake'. There
are also verb roots, both transitive and intransitive, that begin with the phonemic
sequence /ba/ which is part of the verb root itself and not signalling a specific
intransitivised form, e.g. bakyamu (intr.vb.) 'Sg/DualS go'; batay (intr.vb.)
'grow'; baraygi (intr.vb.) 'n PIS dive close to surface'; batawered (tr.vb.) 'throw
SgO'; bayswer (tr.vb.) 'carry on shoulder' (related to the verb ayswer 'give
Pauc/PlO'?). There are also instances where the intransitiviser has become
lexicalised in that it is always affixed to the verb and contributes a distinct
meaning. The relationship between the transitive and intransitive form is not
always transparent, e.g. 6ka ba-tager (intr.vb.) 'worry' (<oka 'concern' <detager
'tell'); ba-kayret (intr.vb.) 'stare at one another' (<ikayret 'roast Sg/DualO on
open fire').
Furthermore, the reader must not assume that verbs must be made
intransitive when they are used without a syntactic argument as it is possible to
have transitive verbs used without the A argument:
(3.48) no nar tabra
nawsriyey
Restr boat 3SgGen 3n SgO-drag up onto shore-PfDual
'Their two boats just got dragged up.'","[103, 104, 105]"
"3.796The morpheme is also used in narratives where the focus of interest is not
the speaker but some other focal place determined within the context of the
narrative. Thus, it can indicate that the event happens at a distance away from
the focal place or that the event happens towards the focal place. The opening
lines of the story of Irwam will demonstrate this use:

The morpheme is also used metaphorically to indicate distance away in
time. Contrast the following two examples:
(3.61) nagerger pe irdi?
Q clitic-dayS Deix n PIS be(time,place)
'What day is it today?'

The main temporal/ aspectual points of reference in the language
correspond to the following:moment

<------------( I )-------------------------------- I
The schema presented above is designed to give the reader a rough idea of
how the temporal/aspectual markers divide up the time line.
Although two different time lines have been postulated for atelic and telic
verbs to capture the present versus nonpresent for atelic verbs and the present
imperfective versus nonpresent imperfective for telic verbs, these have the same
time reference. The difference between the two lies in that atelic verbs do not
have a perfective reading given that it is semantically incongruous to mark such
a notion whereas for telic verbs, a contrast between the perfective and
imperfective can be established. The present refers to all events/ states that occur
at the time of the speech act or to events that occur prior on the same day. The
nonpresent refers to all other times.
The severed temporal/ aspectual line for telic verbs reflects shared as well as
distinctive features in the verbal morphology. There is a contrast in form as well
as temporal reference between nonfuture perfective and future perfective
markers (where future perfective refers to an event that will be completed). The
set of markers for the future-nonpresent and that for the nonpresent-past share
forms although these have different person reference. Both of these have non-98present reference. The nonfuture perfective markers contrast with the
nonpresent-past markers as the former can be used for events that occurred on
the same day as the speech act whereas the latter cannot. It is for the reasons
outlined above that a split temporal/ aspectual line has been drawn which both
relates and distinguishes the forms.
What has not been represented in the time line above are the
temporal/ aspectual markers used for the remote past. These markers are a
combination in form of the prefix wa- and present imperfective, perfective and
past suffixes. Nothing will be said about them here as they will be treated in
detail below.
3.8.1 Tense/Aspect/Mood/Number Suffixes.","[107, 108, 109, 110]"
"5.2.2 Experiencer type Clauses.
There is only one verb which has been collected to date where the
agreement on the verb appears to be determined by the number of the possessor,
not the number of the possessed. Consider the following examples:
(5.30) kara
nyap bark- i
1SgGen thirsts happen-Pf
'I am thirsty I Thirst happened to me.'
(5.31) yaba
nyap barug- da
3n SgGen thirstS happen-PfPl
'They were thirsty I Thirst happened to them.'
(5.32) keriba
werer bark- iyey
ln SgExclGen hungers happen-PfDual
'We two (excl.) are hungry I Hunger happened to us (excl).'
The experience itself could be regarded as either the same phenomenon
shared by all experiencers, in which case, one would expect singular marking on
the verb or it could be regarded as a phenomenon experienced individually by
each of the experiencers. It is this latter interpretation which is suggested by the
verbal marking. Alternatively, the structure suggests that the possessor has
subject properties by virtue of its initial position in the clause and verb
agreement.
Both this construction and equational clauses can be used for experiences.
The distinction between the two is unclear:186(5.33)e
nyap-ge daIi
3SgS thirst-Loe n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is thirsty.'
(5.34) abra
nyap bark- i
3SgGen thirsts happen-Pf
'He is (now) thirsty I Thirst happened to him.'
The distinction may be that existential sentences convey a state whereas
experiencer type clauses convey a change of state, or it may be that one state is
more permanent than another. Examples need to be elicited to test whether both
types can be modified by the same set of adverbial/temporal modifiers:
?e no kerkar nyapge dali/?abra nyap no kerkar bark-i 'He is just recently thirsty.'
?e emetu nyap-ge daw-i/?abra nyap emetu bark-i 'He was already thirsty.'
?'He is always thirsty.'
5.3The Verb Complex.
There are a number of uninflected nominals occurring within a sentence.
These must be considered as part of the verb complex. Consider the following
examples:
(5.35) ter mayso [mir iga- Ii]
reef noises word speak-Prlmpf
'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.36) Galiga [ut iperedi]
G.S
sleep n PIS be lying-Pr
'Galiga is sleeping.'
The nominals mir 'word' and ut 'sleep' must be part of the verbal phrase
for the following reasons. The verbs given above are intransitive as evidenced by
zero marking on the S argument so the non-S argument cannot be 0. Its
function must be part of the verb phrase. Other arguments found in support of
this analysis follow.
Nominals in the verbal phrase must occur immediately preceding the verb,
which suggests they form a syntactic unit:
(5.37) *mir ter mayso igali
'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.38) *ut Galiga iperedi
'Galiga is sleeping.'
There is some suprasegmental evidence that the nominal and verb form a
single phonological unit. The main pitch-accent of the verb phrase is carried on
the nominal when it is mono-syllabic and the verb itself begins with a vowel,
e.g. tit ipe 'n PIS be lying asleep', but ipe 'n PIS be lying'.
However, there are instances where the nominal's role is not
straightforward and it could either be a verbal nominal (i.e. within the verbal
187complex) or a syntactic argument of the verb. Consider the following examples
where the verb might be di-transitive or transitive with a complex verb phrase:
(5.39) koskiride lumi dikris-li
uteb- ge
(married)female-A weed dear- Prlmpf place-Loe
'The woman is clearing her place.'
(5.40) koskiride (uteb) lumi dikris-li
(married)female-A placeO weed dear- Prlmpf
'The woman is clearing (her place).'
In 5.39, number reference for the nonA nominal (be it 0 or whatever) is
automatically plural and no further cross-reference marking can be used. As 0
arguments for transitive verbs can be cross-referenced on the verb for number,
one must assume that the nominal is not an 0 and thus part of the verb complex.
Contrasting with this, in 5.40, number specification for 0 is singular, referring to
the number of yards, and cross-reference marking can be used to indicate
nonsingular number as exemplified below:
(5.41) koskiride neys uteb lumi da-rakris- i
(married)female-A two placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-Pf
'The woman cleared two yards.'
(5.42) koskiride neys a
netat uteb lumi da-rakris- idare
(married)female-A two Conj one placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-P£Pauc
'The woman cleared several yards.'
(5.43) koskiride mitkar uteb lumi da-rakris- a
(married)female-A many placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-P£Pl
'The woman cleared many yards.'
The cross-reference markers for 0 provide syntactic evidence that the
nominal lurni 'weed' is part of the verbal complex and not an 0 argument.
Given that there are complex verbal phrases in the language, it may be
possible to interpret one of the arguments of a di-transitive verb as a nominal
within the verb phrase rather than a syntactic argument. Consider an example
with a di-transitive verb such as ikwar 'give':
(5.44) ka
abi lu
ikwari
lSgA 3Sg0 thingO give Sg/DualO-Pf
'I gave him something.'
(5.45) ka
abi lu
nakwari
lSgA 3Sg0 thingO 3n SgO-give sg/ dualO-Pf
'I gave him two things.'
(cross-reference marking to the inanimate 0 argument lu 'thing')
(5.46) ka
yabi lu
na- kwarda
lSgA 3n SgO thingO 3n Sg-give Sg/DualO-PfFl
'I gave them something.'
(cross-reference marking to the animate 0 argument yabi '3n SgO')188As either of the nonA nominals can be cross-referenced on the verb (5.45
and 5.46), one must assume that both nominals are syntactic arguments of the
verb with the specification that only one of the arguments can be cross-referenced
at any one time on the verb. More examples need to be collected with (di)transitive verbs to prove this.
A couple of transitive verbs have been collected where the nominal can
either be part of the verb complex or a syntactic argument:
(5.47) ka
mara mir
asr- i
1SgA 2SgGen wordO hear-Pf
'I heard your message.'
ditkiri(i)
(5.48) ka lar- ira gepi
1SgA fish-Gen scalesO peel,scrape-Pf
'I scaled the fish.'
mari mir n(a)asr- i
(5.49) ka
1SgA 2Sg0 word 1/2Sg0-hear-Pf
'I heard you (talking).'
(5.50) ka kumala
gegur ditkiri(i)
1SgA sweet potatoO peel peel,scrape-Pf
'I peeled the sweet potato.'
It is unclear what the semantic distinction is between the two types. One
possibility may be that the nominal incorporated into the verbal phrase (5.49 and
5.50) is indefinite whilst the non-incorporated nominal (5.47 and 5.48) is definite.
An alternative explanation would be that the incorporated nominal focusses on
the activity itself whilst the non-incorporated nominal focusses on an end-point,
a purpose. Note, however, that for many verbs, there is no choice.
There are examples of lexicalised complex verb phrases, that is where the
noun is an inseparable part of the verb phrase and its meaning. Examples of
lexicalised complex verb phrases include for intransitive verbs: i ezo 'cry'
(<tearN, shed?), erer ekri 'shout, squawk' (<shoutN, emit?), segur etker 'play'
(<playN, ?), kobek esi 'cough' (<coughN, bang down upon waves), and for
transitive verbs: upi diti 'help' (<tail?,?), lag dasur 'smell' (<smellN, ?), tag
digwat 'shake hands' (<hand, pull), op dipit 'meet' (<face, hit?), tep diskir 'taste'
(<skin of fruit, activity to do with mouth?).
Within complex verbal phrases, a nominal can always be isolated from the
verbal component because verbal inflections occur only on the verb, not on the
nominal, and the nominal can always occur as an independent lexeme. It seems
that the generalization is as follows: at one end of the continuum, there are
nominals functioning as syntactic arguments of the verb and at the other end of
the continuum, there are nominals within verbal phrases forming an essential
part of the verb phrase's meaning. In between these two extremes, there are189some verbs which allow both types to occur and these are exploited for various
stylistic purposes.

5.4The Noun Complex.
The structure of a noun complex is as follows:Determiner-N[modifier]Adjective
lNoun-GenlN[head]- giz 'Pl'
·(iba-ibi 'n Sg') £N-kem 'Ass'
N-ey 'Dual'l(5.51)[able mitkar epey ] pe da-ramar
Det many baskets Deix I -3n SgS- I PIS be resting upon
'The many baskets are there (resting upon something).'
(5.52) [able kebi bam+bam nar ] pe ikase
Det little tumeric Adj boats Deix be going along
'The little yellow van is going by.'
(5.53) lim-ira bi
sun-Gen light
'sunlight'
Case inflections are suffixed to the head or clitic immediately following the
head, i.e. giz, iba-ibi. Genitive nouns follow the order with the possessor (the
modifier) preceding the possessed (the head).
The plural marker -giz(e) always directly follows the noun which it
modifies:
(5.54) gayr legize kari natager-da
alot person-PIA lSgO 1/2Sg0-tell- P£Pl
'Alot of people told me.'
The marker -giz(e) behaves like inflections, which are always suffixed to the
noun. It can be regarded as a post-clitic since it forms a single phonological unit
with the noun, i.e. there is a single pitch-accent, e.g. netat le '1 person', gayr le-giz
'many people'.
Not included in the structure of the noun complex outlined above are
locational adjuncts often involving a nominal and a locational noun acting like a
kind of postposition. Both are inflected for case:
(5.55) ka [pon- ge muy- ge] nazirkedi
lSgS <Eng-Loe inside-Loe 1/2Sg/PlS-Sg/DualS be inside-Pr
'I was inside the phone box.'","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"
"38These are the only examples collected ending with -im.
8.
The ablative case (-lam/-ilam), like the allative case, has local, temporal
and causal meanings. It is used to mark the point from which there is
movement away:
(2.51) e
op- dewday- lam ta- bakyamu- da
3SgS face-mainland-Ahl Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
'He came from Papua New Guinea.'
(2.52) e
tabi paser-lam
3SgS Deix-climb down-Pf hill- Ahl
'He came down from the hill.'
This case inflection can also be used to mark the cause (of a non-finite
clause):
(2.53) ka gim+gim n(a)- aIi
waywi aro- lam
lSgS illness Adj 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf mangoO eatN-Abl
'I am sick from eating mangoes.'
It can also be extended in meaning to include a temporal notion, i.e. to
mark from a particular point in time:
(2.54) ki-lam 'from/ since last night'
emeret-lam 'from a long time ago'
9.
The genitive case (-ira - -ra) is used to mark the beneficiary or goal of an
action:
(2.55) ka laglag epey
a- rapeylu
kari
ama- ra
lSgS wantN basketO Futl-buy Sg/DualO-FutlSg lSgGen mother-Gen
'I want to buy a basket for my mother.'
Note that there is overlap in the functions of the allative case with its
purposive function and the genitive case with its beneficiary function. (It remains
to be tested whether it can also be used as a maleficiary.) It could be argued that in
Meryam Mir, the genitive case includes within its meaning both a benefactive
and purposive meaning. This would account for the more felicitous and
common sentence given below with the genitive rather than the allative case:
(2.56) kara
mekir
ageg
tiruko
lSgGen almond(tree) fleshy fruit?O Deix-pluck PIO-Fut2/3sg
'Pick me some almonds.'
?kari-m mekir ageg tiruk
-All
The two cases, namely the genitive and allative case, must have some
overlap in their function as well as permitting some slight nuance in meaning
because there are examples where the two cases co-occur within a single sentence:39(2.57)ka abra
kerkar wali
ti- d- irapeyda
1SgA 3SgGen fresh clothingO Deix-3Gen-buy Sg/DualO-PfSg
tciwn-ge abi- m
town-Loe 3Sg-All
'I bought him a new shirt in town.'
Clearly more work needs to be done in this area to refine the distinctions
between the allative and genitive cases.
The genitive case is used to mark the possessor/owner of an alienable or
inalienable object/physical quality /person/body part:
asr- i
(2.58) ka pleyn-ira bUm.er dlsgA <Eng- Gen soundO 3Gen-hear-Pf
'I heard the plane's noise.'
(2.59) Warib-ira tag

Gen hand/fingers cut- PfSg
W.'W arib's finger got cut.'
(2.60) Lez-ira newbet ewmi-da
L.- Gen FZ S die- PfSg
'Les' aunty died.'
The genitive case can also be used to mark the experiencer of a physical or
emotional state:
bark- i
(2.61) Galiga-ra werer
Gen hungers happen-Pf
G.'Galiga is hungry /Hunger happened for Galiga.'
(2.62) able lera weku bark- i
Det person-Gen angers happen-Pf
'That person is angry I Anger happened for that person.'
The genitive case cannot occur when the complex noun phrase itself is
marked by a case as in the following examples. In 2.63, it cannot occur with the
locative case; in 2.64, it cannot occur with the ergative case; in 2.65, it cannot
occur with the semblative case and in 2.66, it cannot occur within a noun phrase
itself marked by the genitive case:
(2.63) e

'He is over there at Les' place.'
*e tadali Lez-ira utebge

pe ikeredi
1Sg? mother-Gen basketS Deix n PIS be(thing)-Prlmpf
'This is my mother's basket I My mother's basket is here.'
*kara amara epey pe ikeredi
1SgGen
The ending suffixed or pronominal form for the absent genitive is
phonologically homophonous with the 0 argument case form for proper nouns,
i.e. -i,or the accusative pronominal form. One could speculate that the case
marker for this argument is the accusative/ dative case marker as it is used in
adnominal possession, it is typically the base for oblique inflections on proper
nouns and pronouns and, it is used to mark definite or human direct objects.
Another possibility is that there are alternations in the form of the genitive case
morpheme itself, i.e. -i ,.. -y, used when the complex noun phrase in which it
occurs carries another case inflection. Evidence that these are indeed
morphological alternations of the genitive case can be seen by the fact that these
case markers also occur with common nouns (which do not take the case suffix -i
in the accusative case) when they are in a possessor relation within a case-marked
complex phrase:
(2.67) kari
newr-i
kimyaride abi detagr-i
1SgGen girl- Gen (married)male-A 3Sg0 tell- Pf
'My daughter's husband told him.'
Contrast with the lexical compound newr kimyar 'sister-in-law' where
there is no genitive marking (2.83):
(2.68) kari newr kimyaride abi detagri
'My sister-in-law told him.'
Another example follows of a common noun suffixed with the alternative
form of the genitive case:
(2.69) able amay werm-et abi detagr-i
Det mother-Gen child- SgA 3Sg0 tell- Pf
'The mother's son told him.'
*able ama wermet abi detagri
Although the genitive case marker cannot be confused with the accusative
case marker in the examples given above, there are many examples in the third
person singular where these two functions cannot be distinguished, that is where
the (pro)nominal phrase could be analysed as the 0 argument or as the
phonologically reduced genitive case. For example:
41ka abi
kerim-ge ipit-i
lSgA 3Sg0-gen? head- Loe hit- Pf
'I hit him on the head/ I hit (him) on his head.'
(2.71) ka abi

(This ambiguity is only present in the singular third person because 1st /2nd
person objects or 3rd person non-singular objects will be cross-referenced on the
verb.)

(2.70)10.
The associative case (-kem) is suffixed to an inanimate noun to indicate
that it was associated although not used to perform the action:
(2.73) e
digm-i koketkem
3SgS walk- Pf walking stick-Ass
'He walked (carrying) his walking stick.'
. (2.74) wi

tabara lu
etakri able mir- kem: ....
(2.75) e
3SgA 3Gen thingO gather Pauc/PlO-Pf Det word-Ass
'He gathered up his things with these words: .. .'
Contrast the above examples with the following where the instrumental
case is used to indicate the action was performed using the object:
(2.76) e digm-i koket-u
-Instr
'He walked using his walking stick.'
(2.77) wi
mir- u
ba- ke-ley
3n SgS word-Instr Intr-do-PastDual
'They (2) insulted each other.'
(lit: they (2) did things to each other using words)
The associative case -kem and the allomorph -ipkem (used with proper
nouns and possibly with kinship terms, e.g. ama-ypkem 'along with mothers),42are used to indicate that the person was associated with a particular event
although not a participant:
(2.78) lu
ba- kawerti Lez-ipkem
thingS Intr-take down Sg/DualO-Pf L.- Ass
'The things were unloaded in Les' presence.'
A similar form and parallel use occurs with pronominals:
(2.79) Dawgiri erkep ikereder
ge Bame-y erdar-i
0 see- Pf
D. S
eye n PIS be(thing)-n Prlmpf Deix Bta- ba- rb- i abi-tkem we- ge akarik-da
Deix-Intr-row-Pf 3Sg-Ass sand-Loe land- PfSg
'Dawgiri was watching when he saw Bame swimming (towards the area
where Dawgiri was) and right in front of Dawgiri, Bame came up onto the
beach.' (Dewmer p210, section12)
Andrews (1985) makes a useful distinction between circumstantial and
participatory roles which correspond neatly to the associative versus
instrumental case. The associative case involves a circumstantial role as the
phrase forms ""part of the setting of the event"" whilst the instrumental case
involves a participatory role with the phrasE; an ""actual participant in the
situation implied by the verb"" (Andrews, Ibid; 69). An argument marked with
-kem/-ipkem is signalling that the thing/person was present although not an
instrument or participant in the activity.
How does the associative differ from the locative when the locative case
carries a comitative meaning? Whilst the locative case is marked on an animate
noun to indicate thats/he performed the same action at the same place as the
S/ A, the associative case is also marked on an animate noun but to indicate that
s/he was at the same place although not performing the event/activity.
However, there is a further use of the associative suffix which is exploited in a
participatory role to indicate paucal or plural inclusion; in this use, it is always
within a complex noun phrase. This function will be examined in the following
section.
Number marking within a complex phrase.
The suffixes -ey 'Dual' and -kem 'Pauc/Pl or Associative' are used within a
complex phrase to indicate that the phrase is dual or paucal/plural respectively:
(2.80) able bab taba newrey...
Det father 3Gen (unmarried)female-Dual

What has been presented above suggests that some verbs have forms from
each conjugation type to convey the number of 0 and that there is a correlation
between conjugation type 1. and overt marking of singular/dual S/O. However,
there are verbs which have forms from each conjugation type and these are
neither semantically nor morphologically motivated. In some cases, the
alternation appears to be phonologically motivated: verb roots from conjugation
2. ending in /r/ are suffixed with paucal forms from conjugation 1, e.g. dasmer
'see' ---> dasmer-i Pf---> dasmer-dare PfPauc, *dasmer-idare; erdar 'watch' --->
erdar-i Pf--> erdar-dare PfPauc, *erdar-idare. In other cases, there is no
phonological environment for predicting the form and these must be considered
exceptions: a verb root from conjugation 2. such as esi 'bang against the waves'
(example from McConvell (1983; 17) has the dual form from conjugation 1.
suffixed, e.g. esi-0 Fut2/3, esi-lam Fut2/3Dual. Many verbs which have been
intransitivised, have forms from each conjugation type, e.g. ba-dmirik 'run
away' (<Intr-chase away) ---> badmirik-da Pf--> badmirik-daryey PfDual -->
badmirk-idere PfPauc, *badmirikdere; ba-rap 'be broken' (<Intr-break) --> barapda Pf--> barap-iyey PfDual, *barap-daryey; ba-rbor 'be broken by tearing' (<Intrthrow?) --> barbor-da Pf--> barbor-iyey PfDual, *barbor-daryey. Given that
inflections from conjugation 1. end predominantly in a consonant whilst those
from conjugation 2. end predominantly with a vowel, these may be
phonologically rather than semantically motivated. Furthermore, note that
when there are related root forms for different number, it is the paucal/plural
forms that often end with a consonant and the singular I dual forms which end in
a vowel. It may be the language is in a process of change and/or speakers are
regularizing the processes although exceptions remain. Some evidence in
support of this latter claim is provided by one speaker who gives 'earlier' forms
of the language: e.g. barap-da 'be broken Pf', older form barapi. Another
hypothesis is that some forms only are semantically motivated whilst others are
morphologically motivated.
Person Markers for S and A.
In the future, tense is shown partly by suffixes whose forms are determined
by the person and partly by the prefixes na- (a-) for 1st person and wa- for 3rd
person. As the prefixes' forms are determined by person, they can be regarded as
portmanteau affixes carrying information about tense and person. Some
examples follow:136(3.234) ka abi a- kware
lSgA 3Sg0 Futl-give Sg/DualO-Futl
'I will give (it) to him.'
(3.235) e
abi wa- ykwar0
3SgA 3Sg0 Fut3-give Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
'He will give (it) to him.'
Contrast these examples with the one below where the 2nd person is used
and there is no prefix. No zero morpheme is hypothesized for the underlying
form as all nonfuture tenses would have zero marking in the prefix position, a
fact that would merely obscure the data:
(3.236) ma abi ikwar0
2SgA 3Sg0 give Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
'Give (it) to him.'
Recall that there are allomorphic distinctions in the future prefix forms
that are based on the transitivity of the verb. With future marking for 3rd
person, a transitive verb's front vowel whether it is carrying the main accent or
not, is reduced to a glide before prefixation whereas an intransitive verb's front
unaccented vowel is not. With future marking for 1st person, the morpheme is
na- for intransitive verbs and -a- for transitive verbs. (See the section on the
morphemes' allomorphs, plll.) Thus, the contrast in the morphemes' forms is
established by the verb's transitivity:
(3.237) ka

'I will return.'

"49(from the tape made for Social Security)
The suffix can also be used with nominalised verbs in a negative
imperative:
(2.114) ma nole aro- kak
2SgA Neg eatN-Priv
'Do not eat (it).'
(The above use needs to be tested with nonsingular (pro)nouns to see whether it
is still possible without the usual cross-referencing for number on the verb.)
Morphemes beginning with a voiceless velar stop such as the privative
suffix -kak or the intensifier suffix -kar (see section 4 below p52) devoice the final
consonant of the root if it is a voiced stop:
/b/>p/-+k/d/>t/g/>kkap-kar 'original M.I. dance'
(>kab 'dance' + kar 'intensifier')
tebut-kak 'without friend'
(>tebud 'friend' + kak 'privative')
la(k)-kak 'dislike, not want'
(>lag 'desire, want' + kak 'privative')3)
The semblative suffix -ise is affixed to a (pro)nominal which is the object of
comparison. There are no examples of this affix followed by a case inflection:
eper-da ebur-ise
(2.115) e

The suffix -ise is frequently preceded by an affix -ka whose meaning is not
clear. Examples of its use are:
(2.117) ma pe siga

kari-ka-yse
2SgA Deix ciggieO drink-Primpf lsg- ?- Smbl

(2.119) nerut le
another persons knowN-Priv Fut3-make K.gen?-?- Smbl
'No-one knows how to make it (cocnnuted rice) like one's Kosir.'
(Note that in the above sentence, the privative phrase is functioning like a
predicate.)50It may be that the semblative suffixes -kayse and -ise do not signal anymeaningful difference but are simply in free alternation. Alternatively, it may beO,
mor.photogical distinction where common nouns take the form -ise and other
nominals (pronouns and proper nouns) take the form -kayse.
The suffix -kayse is also used with adjectives with a comparative effect:
(2.120) able wag kikem kelar- kak wam-i

kelar
aw-ka-yse batay-0
Conj Restr 3SgGen strengths big-?- Smbl grow-Pf
'At first, the wind blew without strength (but then), its strength just
grew bigger (or big-like?).'
The related suffix -ka, which is often reduplicated on adjectives, occurs as a't\i
intensifier to indicate a greater or lesser degree:
(2.121) e
aw le
daIi
3SgS big person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a big/old man.'
(2.122) e
aw-ka+ka le
daIi
3SgS big- Intens person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a very big/old person.'
In 2.122, -ka(ka) is functioning as an adjectival intensifier. There is a
similar derivation -kar which is added to nouns as an intensifier with the
meaning 'the real N, the even more like N':
(2.123) keymerkar
young sibling-Intens
'the youngest sibling'
(2.124) ukar
pe daIi
coconut-Intens Deix n PIS be(person?)-Prlmpf
'Those are the proper kind of palm trees.'
The suffix -ka occurring on adjectives and the suffix -kar occurring on
nouns could be related and these in turn are probably related to the semblative
construction with -kayse.
There are comparative constructions with the ablative case used to mark a
standard comparison (2.125 and 2.126) and the allative case used to mark the
property with respect to which a comparison is made (2.127):

These examples are illustrative for another reason. The two
morphological categories do not coincide exactly with the semantic categories that
were postulated. Thus, the verb ikasir 'be going along' and the verb esk (< -kos)
'be flowing' are not atelic stative verbs yet behave morphologically with verbs of
this category. There are two possible explanations for these facts. One
explanation is that verbs which are atelic stative in one language such as in
English need not be so in another language such as Meryam Mir. An alternative
explanation is that these categories are essentially morphological categories
which cannot be fully specified on a semantic basis.
3.3Transitive and Intransitive Verbs.
It has been established that a distinction needs to be drawn between atelic
stative and telic active verbs partly on the basis of their morphology and partly on
the basis of semantic criterion. What of the distinction between transitive and
intransitive verbs?
On the basis of arguments which the verbs select, a distinction can be
drawn between transitive and intransitive verbs as the nominals bear A, S or 0
case marking. However, the verbal morphology itself does not cross-reference
strictly on a ergative-absolutive basis nor on a nominative-accusative basis but
rather displays features of both types and some verbs can even employ either type. or
both typesof cross-reference marking.
Consider first a nominative-accusative type cross-reference marking
system. With atelic stative verbs (which are all intransitive verbs), number and,
to some degree, person of the S argument, are marked by means of prefixing:
(3.20) kara
sospan pe da-rakmerkedi
lSgGen <EngS Deix I -3n SgS-1 Sg/DualS be resting upon-Pr
urmeme-ge
fireplace- Loe
'My two saucepans are resting upon the stove.'
Similarly, 0 arguments of transitive verbs are cross-referenced on the verb
by means of prefixing:
(3.21) ka
sospan da-rakmerikda(ri) urmeme-ge
lSgA <EngO I -3n Sg0-1 put resting Sg/DualO upon-PfSg fireplace-Loe
'I put the two saucepans resting upon the stove.'
It should be noted that under certain conditions, namely with the number
hierarchy, the 0 can be cross-referenced for number in the suffix position but86there is specification in the prefix position (at least for 3rd person and for some
verbs with 1/2nd person):
(3.22) ka
yabi da-ratagr-idare
1SgA 3n SgO I -3n Sg0-1 tell- Pauc
'I told them (few).'
With telic active verbs involving intransitive verbs, plural number of the
S argument can be cross-referenced by a prefix:
(3.23) wi
ba- mri
3n SgS PIS-Pauc/PIS sit down-Pf
'They all sat down.'
However, for all other numbers (including plural for some verbs), the S
argument is cross-referenced by a suffix:
(3.24) ki
bakyamu- daryey
ln SgExclS Sg/DualS go-PfDual
'We two (excl) went.'
(3.25) ki
bakyawda
ln SgExclS Pauc/PIS go-PEPI
'We all went.'
Similarly, with telic active verbs involving transitive events, the A
argument is cross-referenced for number by means of a suffix:
(3.26) ki
keriba
lewer erapeydaryey
ln SgExclA ln SgExclGen foodO buy Sg/DualO-PfDual
'We two (excl) bought our food.'
Thus, a correlation can be noted between the cross-reference markers and
the transitivity and type of verb. Prefixes are used for S of atelic stative verbs, 0
arguments and for some plural S of telic active intransitive verbs. Suffixes are
used for A or S arguments of telic active verbs. The first type of cross-referencing
is reminiscent of an absolutive case pattern with Sand 0 receiving the same
marking. The second type of cross-referencing is reminiscent of a nominative
case pattern with Sand A receiving the same marking. Both of these represent
general patterns and within them, the reader should be aware that there are
deviations, i.e. the 0 argument can be marked by a suffix.
McConvell in his study (1983; 44-45) on ergative and verb agreement
reaches a similar conclusion using different but related evidence. His argument
is that the suffix slot on the verb is neither strictly 'ergative' nor 'accusative' as A,
S and 0 arguments can be cross-referenced in this position. The prefix slot,
however, is clearly 'ergative' in its operation, only being filled by 0 arguments or
by A/S 1st or 3rd person future markers (although he did not have examples of
atelic stative verbs which do have S arguments cross-referenced in the prefix slot
irrespective of tense).","[96, 97, 98]"
"1674.3i1)i - low deixis marker
When speakers are asked to contrast the markers i and pe/ge, they say the
latter typically involves gesture whereas i does not. A linguistic explanation for
this feature is that pe and ge are high deictic markers, i.e. they have a stronger
new information content and request a higher degree of focus or attention on
behalf of the addressee) whereas i is a low deictic marker and does not require the
same degree of focus or attention. Consider the following examples with pe
contrasted minimally with i:
(4.78) able cup
i
ike
Det <EngS Deix n PIS be(thing)
'The cup is over here.'
(where the cup is closer to the speaker than to the addressee)
(4.79) able cup pe ike

(where the speaker is holding out the cup towards the addressee)

(with the implication being that they were not growing before?)
The examples with pe involve a change of state or location and hence a
high deictic marker is used whereas in the examples with i, there is no change in
state or location and hence a low deictic marker is used.i- place
'non-specific area' /'away from addressee'
In a number of examples with verbs of non-motion or verbs of location, i
seems to mark a general area or possibly a place away from the addressee:2)168(4.84)inner ni

It can occur with the deictic affix -noko which is used to indicate distance
away from the speech act.:

3)i - sourceThe marker i also implies movement away from the addressee or from the
deictic centre. In this context, it can be regarded as a source marker:

3SgS Deix be going along
'There he goes.'
(4.90) e
pe ikase
3SgS Deix be going along

away from the speech act place or merely not moving in the speaker's general
direction.)

'The ghost's noise was (heard) travelling away.'
(i.e. it was heard travelling away from the location of the main
protagonist)
Contrast the above examples with the following where the marker ge is
used implying movement to or towards a location, i.e. a goal marker, although
the goal can never coincide with the speaker:
(4.93) able lamar-ira burner ge ti- ditimdi
Det spirit- Gen noises Deix Deix-travel of noise?-Pr-Pf?
'The ghost's noise was (heard) travelling towards him.'
(i.e. it was heard travelling towards the location of the main protagonist)

(4.95) ka ge- ka na- ba
lSgS Deix-lSgS Futl-go
'I will go there.' (correct translation?)
As evidence that the marker i is associated with the source, consider the
following example where its occurrence with an ablative phrase is acceptable but
unacceptable with an allative noun phrase:
(4.96) mi
1- mi
na- bakyawdere
uteb-lam
1n SginclS Deix-ln SginclS Futl-Pauc/PlS go-FutlPauc place-Ahl
'We (incl) will now go from this place.'
*mi 1-mi na-bakyaw-dere uteb-em
All
The spatial notion can be extended to a temporal notion.
(4.92)i - future (punctual)/nonimperative
The marker i can also be used to mean 'from this point in time (onwards)'.
One can see from the translations given in the following examples that the spatial
use is extended in time where movement away from a place is parallel to events
moving away from now. Consider:
(4.97) Abob a
Kos, wiyaba
ad
1- ka d-atawt-e
A.
Conj K., 3n SgGen storyO Deix-lSgA 1-Futl- I tell- Futl

(4.98) ka
abi 1ka a- rdar-e
lSgA 3Sg0 Deix-lSgA Futl-see- Futl
'I will see him from now on.'
It is unclear whether it is the same homophonous reduced morpheme or
clitic -y attached to pronominals that is used with the meaning 'at that point in4)'I170time'. (It could possibly be glossed as 'from that point in time'.) With nominals,
the form ya (rather than i) tends to be used although the correlation might simply
be due to the lack of acoustic salience when -y is used. Here are some examples
with pronouns:
(4.99) ese ka na- bakyamulu
pamas-em
if lSgS Futl-Sg/DualS go-FutlSg shop- All
kay
mara siga

o- bakyamu- B
T.1.-em?
what 3SgS-Deix Fut3-Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 T.1.-All
'Is he going to T.I?'
This marker is not obligatory although clearly preferred in some instances.
Thus, in conditional/hypothetical sentences, it tends to occur whereas with
interrogatives, it may or may not be present. The shared meaning of i and -y
seems to be as a future marker but how is this use related to its use as a source
marker? These two functions do have one feature in common, namely that the
future marker i occurs with events that are either temporally or spatially close
and the source marker i must be, by definition, closer to the deictic centre, the
place of the speech act than the goal.
The distinction between its spatial and temporal use is not discrete and this
may be a contributing factor to the disagreement amongst speakers as to the
suitability and acceptability of sentences when i has future spatial reference.
For some speakers, the marker i can only be used to indicate a general area
close-by and/ or it involves an event in the immediate future. Thus, the
following sentence is unacceptable as it overtly marks distance away from the
speech act with the verbal deictic t(V)-:
(4.102) *ka ika ta- ra- mrilu
lSgS Deix-lSgS Deix-Futl-n PIS sit down-FutlSg
'I will sit down away from here.'
When it is 1st or 2nd person, distance away from the speech act must be
expressed with the deictic markers ge or ya:
(4.103) ka ge- ka ta- ra- mrilu

'I will sit down over there.'

The temporal reference of nonpresent sometimes appears to also include
the present when referring to habitual events and probably means something
like: it is always this way and will always be this way. It might also be indicating
that it is not occurring at the time of the speech act but does indeed happen, i.e. a
kind of present irrealis. For example:
(3.93) Lez w- ekyam-dar-er

(The discussion of the morpheme/root form -dar- will be delayed until the end of
the section outlining the meanings and functions of the Non-Productive
Derivations p142.)
Perfective.
The suffixes in this category are in their broad meaning nonfuture markers
used for events that are completed,, or about to be completed, at the time of the
speech act. They thus encode a temporal feature of nonfuture as well as an
aspectual feature of perfectivity. To illustrate their meaning, here are a few
examples:
(3.95) ka paret ti- dirp- i

1SgA ln SglnclGen big fishO scoop Sg/DualO-Pfsg fish trap-Instr
'I have scooped up our big fish with the fish trap.'
There are instances where the nonfuture perfective is used for events that
are not yet completed at the time of the utterance. Such events are punctiliar and
the perfective is used to indicate that the outcome or achievement is inevitable
and imminent. It is for this reason that it is appropriate the marker should
involve a temporal element, namely, the nonfuture. Consider the following
examples where the imminent realisation and the punctuality of the event
necessitate the perfective:
(3.98) ka pe- ka wabi dikayrt-i
1SgA Deix-1SgA 2n SgO leave- Pf
'I will now leave you (pl) here.'
(3.99) ka
pe- ka mari namri-da
1SgA Deix-1SgA 2Sg0 1 /2Sg0-sit- PfSg
'I am now leaving you (sg) here.'
The perfective suffixes are also used to indicate a change of state, something
that has re~ulted from a process:
(3.100) kara
tag pim ismida
1SgGen hand finger cut Sg/DualO-PfSg
'My finger got cut.'
(3.101) awmkep

(3.102) able nar eyrsida

'The boat has become caught on the reef.'
(3.103) pamas ba- ymida
shop Intr-close Sg/DualO-PfSg
'The shop is closed, i.e. it has become closed.'
Contrast the above example (3.103) with that below (3.104) which is a
nominalised verb used in an ascriptive sentence and involves a state, not a
change of state:
(3.104) able pamas aymir+aymir ike(redi)
Det shops close N.
n PIS be(thing)-Pr
'The shop is closed.'
108One feature that distinguishes change of state perfective verbs from statives
is the alteration in meaning of the adverb emetu 'already'. When it is used with
a change of state, it implies a recent change. When it is used with a state, it
implies that the state has been like that for some time.
(3.105) pamas emetu ba-ymi-da
(change of state)
'The shop is now closed.'
(3.106) pamas emetu aymir+aymir ilce
(state)
'The shop is already closed (and has been for a while).'
Many problems still remain with the perfective marker used for changes of
state: What is the syntactic function and semantic role of the noun phrase in
such sentences? Does the nominal have the syntactic function of S or is it still 0
with the A omitted yet somehow still recoverable? Is it always the same function
and role?
NonPresent-Future-Past.
The markers for future and past have been grouped together on the basis of
their similarity in form as well as in function. What distinguishes them from
other markers is their reference to nonpresent time. Furthermore, the future
forms and the past forms closely resemble each other although person
distinctions are made for the future which are absent for the past. Given the
limited data and understanding of the nonpresent-past, it is best to keep these
two tenses discrete in the analysis.
Future-NonPresent.
It is pertinent to begin the discussion on future tense by examining its
prefix forms. These involve the markers wa- for 3rd person and (n)a- for 1st
person.
(3.107) e
wa- ditar-0
3SgA Fut3-write-Fut2/3
'He will write (it).'

1SgA 1-Futl- I write-Futl
'I will write (it).'
(3.109) e
wey-ekweyreder
3SgS Fut3-be standing-n Pr
'He will be standing.'
The future markers are prefixed to both telic and atelic verbs although
when the first person future marker is prefixed to a 1st person atelic stative verb,
it cannot be distinguished from the 1/2Sg/Pl marker given these are
homophonous:109(3.110) ka ya- ka nakweyreder adge
lSgS Deix-lSgS 1/2Sg/Pl+Futl-be standing-n Pr outside-Loe
'I will be standing outside later.'
The reader might be tempted to regard future markers as discontinuous
morphemes consisting of a prefix and suffix. Such an approach would fail to
recognise that both these prefixes and suffixes can occur with non-future
temporal reference and that it is the combination of these forms which gives
them their future meaning. As such, they can be regarded as co-occurring
morphemes.
The future is used with all events or states which will begin some time in
the future (with the exception of habitual events as discussed above where the
event is specified as occurring all the time although not necessarily at the time of
the speech act).
(3.111) sogi o- ba- sirik-o

'Come, let us eat.'
(3.114) ka na- ba kab na- rye

'I am going to dance.'
It can also be used for events that may have already commenced at the time
of the speech act but are expected to continue for some time. Consider the
following example where the act of eating has already commenced but the
speaker wishes to convey the notion that it will continue to happen. This is in
contrast with the present imperfective where there is no such expectation:

There are two examples in the data of the sequences /wn/ and /wl/ which
might suggest that all consonants can occur with the bilabial glide preceding.
However, both of the examples (and there is only one example of each) are
obvious English loan words:
tawn English town

More examples could be collected at a later date which could refute the claim that
these are non-permissible sequences.

Judging by the number of examples collected in the data, the frequency of
the lateral plus stop cluster is very low. These clusters (i.e. lateral plus
consonant) may be the result of borrowing as of the eight examples collected, two
refer to names of bananas- a source of potential word loan as different types of
bananas were/ are exchanged, possibly resulting in the name being introduced
into the language from the banana supplier /linguistic group.
The lack of lateral plus voiced alveolar cluster, i.e. /Id/, is probably just a gap.
For the cluster /lk/, only one example was obtained from Ray's dictionary.

look, glance'-> deketi-da Pf, *deketir-da; et6mer- 'show'-> a-t6me-lu FutlSg, *at6mer-lu. This suggests that a distinction needs to be made between verbs and
non-verbs when examining the phonotactic structure of the language.. ii261.5.2 Summary Table of Consonant Clusters.

"28CHAPTER TWO
NOMINALS
In this chapter, the different parts of speech will be briefly examined beforelooking at nominals.
2.1Parts of Speech.
The following parts of speech need to be distinguished:
Nouns
Verbs
Adjectives
Pronouns
Adverbs
Deictic Markers
Clause Relators
Exclamations/Interjections
Nouns.
Nouns are an open word class including both concrete or abstract nouns.
Concepts such as hunger, thirst, fatness and width are expressed in the language
as nouns; for example, 6mar 'good feeling', weku 'anger', werer 'hunger', nyap
'thirst', dob 'fatness', deg 'width', piri 'height', new 'ripeness, blister', kiris
'rawness'. This class of words is inflected for case through suffixes. Within this
class, a distinction needs to be drawn between common nouns, which inflect by
distinguishing A from S/O,and proper nouns, which inflect differently for all
three cases. There are many compound nouns formed with either two nouns,
e.g. kerim le 'boss' (kerim 'head' and le 'person'), or a nominalized verb and
noun, e.g. aro+aro tup 'sardines' (< ero 'eat'+ tup 'sardine').
Verbs.
Verbs are an open class of words which refer to either states, e.g. ut ipe 'be
asleep', processes, e.g. esk 'flow', edug 'burn', or events, e.g. ewmi 'die', ero 'eat'.
The verb has inflections carrying aspectual/ temporal information as well as
number /person agreement cross-referencing syntactic arguments. These markers
provide the formal characteristics that permit verbs to be categorised into two
classes. These two classes,, have some semantic correlation dividing atelic
statives from telic process verbs although class membership can be purely formal.
For example, an event such as ikase 'go along' is classified, at least
morphologicall~ as an intransitive atelic stative verb, i.e. 'be going along'.","[39, 40]"
"Present (atelic) and Present Imperfective.
The suffixes in these categories are used to mark events or states that are
still occurring at the time of the speech act,orJ that were occurring at a time earlier
on the same day as the speech act:
(3.72) able idimge paret ka dirup- li
Det morning-Loe dustO lSgA sweep-Prlmpf
Lez pe ta- bakyamu- da meta- em
L.S Deix Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg house-All
'I was sweeping this morning (when) Les came home.'
(3.73) able aw le
pe gerger-ge muredi idimlam
Det big persons Deix day- Loe Sg/DualS be sitting-Pr morning-Ab!
'That old man has been sitting in the sun since this morning.'
Contrast the above examples with those following where the time
reference is to the day before:
(3.74) abgerger-ge ka paret derp- er
kari
uteb- ge
former-day- Loe lSgA dustO sweep-n Prlmpf lSgGen place-Loe
'Yesterday, I swept at my place.'
(3.75) abgerger-ge aw koskir
imireder
former-day- Loe big married females Sg/DualS be sitting-n Pr
meta- ge sepge kemer+kemer gerger ikadari
house-Loe ground-Loe all Adj
dayS(?) take Sg/DualO-PfSg
'Yesterday, the old woman sat beneath the house the whole day long.'
The present imperfective marker is also used to indicate
repetition/iterativity. Examples to illustrate this latter use follow:
(3.76) abra
ney
dike
Awmkep nade lim baraygi- Ii
3SgGen nameA n PlS be(word) A.
where suns n PIS dive-Prlmpf
'It is called Awmkep (the place) where the sun always sets.'
(3.77) bakir did- Ii
stones rock-Prlmpf
'The stone is rocking (because of the waves smashing against it).'
(3.78) ka ewpamaretIi
lSgS Pauc/PlS jump-Prlmpf
'I am jumping.'
Note the paucal/plural root of 'jump' is used as forms in the imperfective
often involve the paucal/plural form of the verb even when there is no paucal or
plural S, A or 0:
(3.79) ka
digwatIi
lSgA haul in Pauc/Pl fish-Prlmpf
'I am fishing.'
*ka digwatmuIi ·
haul in Sg/Dual fish104ka
ewpamaretli
1SgS Pauc/PlS jump-Prlmpf
'I am jumping.'
*ka ewpamali
Sg/DualS jump
(Contrast with example 3.76 where the nonplural form of the verb is used.)
How to account for this specification? One possibility is to state that
imperfective verbs are not specified for number in the root and hence, the least
marked form is used (either the paucal/plural or nonplural form) as the event or
activity is not yet completed and consequently, it is not possible to use a specific
verb root form (singular I dual-plural).
(3.80)NonPresent (atelic) and NonPresent Imperfective.
The suffixes in these categories are used to mark events or states that were
occurring on a day prior to that of the speech act or following the time of the
speech act:
(3.81) abkerbi
ki- ge ki
koskirey
former-night-Loe 1n SgExdS 1n SgExclGen married female-Dual

Deix dose- Loe shore-Loe Sg/DualS be growing-n Pr
'... so they thus went and stood up at the almond tree which grows dose to
the shore.' (Dewmer, p209, section7)
The nonpresent imperfective can also be used to indicate repetition/
iterativity of nonpresent events:
(3.84) ... a

' ... and whenever they (sandpipers) flew around squawking, the father
would stand up, walk over, take a look wanting to know who might have
been coming along.' (Dewmer, p209, sectionlO)

'He ran away, scraping his knees and the branches scratching him (i.e.
over and over again).'
When the nonpresent (imperfective) markers are used for the future, they
are used in conjunction with the 1st person prefix (n)a- and with the 3rd person
prefix wa-, which can be described broadly as future temporal prefixes:
fka marl nawkayr-er

'... (talking about making a Kapamar) Put down stones (and when) that is
done (and they are) there, come and take out the flour (i.e. take it all out
at the one time) and put it down.' (How to make damper, p22 f, sections)

(3.89) ka
lSgS Futl-Sg/DualS go-Futl still rainS Fut3-thrown Prlmpf
'I will go (as) the rain will set in.'
For most telic active verbs, the nonpresent imperfective is used to mark
repetition/iterativity, that is events which can be viewed as future habituals:
(3.90) idimge ka lewer d-akasr- er
morning-Loe lSgA foodO I -Futl-1 cook-n Prlmpf
'From tomorrow morning onwards, I will be doing the cooking.'","[115, 116, 117]"

(Note that not all tense/aspect distinctions are maintained for all numbers.)99Certain tense/aspect markers such as the Nonfuture Perfective,
Future-Nonpresent (with 1st and 2nd person), the Past-Nonpresent and the
Irrealis Non-committal have two distinct conjugation types. To date, no
phonological or syntactic features has been found to motivate the distinction.
(See the section on cross-reference markers for number for details p135.)
The temporal markers of atelic stative verbs are often absent from the verb
and consequently, the temporal reference is left to be inferred from the context:
(3.63) e
ikasereder
3SgS be going along-n Pr
'He was going along.'
(3.64) e
ikaseredi
3SgS be going along-Pr
'She is/was going along.' (today)
--->
e ikase 'He was I is going along.'
This may be the result of copying from the nonsingular form of certain
atelic verbs that are also unmarked for tense. In this latter case, a telic plural
intransitive verb is used1 which is placed directly following the atelic verb as part
of the verb complex. Its function appears to be solely for carrying tense and it is
also frequently omitted, with temporal reference left for inference:
(3.65) wi
nakasir
weret-lare

'They were going along.'
(3.66) wi
nakasir
wert- eda
3n SgS 3n SgS-be going along Pl vb?-PrPl
'They are/were going along.' (today)
--->
wi nakasir 'They were/ are going along.'
Markers used in the future involve the addition of prefixes for 1st and 3rd
person namely (n)a- for 1st person and wa- (o-) for 3rd person as well as suffixes.
There are several other temporal/ aspectual distinctions that are all derived
from other existing forms or rather a combination of prefix and suffix. The past
irrealis is formed by the prefix wa- and the perfective suffix:
(3.67) e
obakyarnu- da
3SgS Pastlrr-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
'He should have come.'
It is also the same form used for the remote pe.rfediv~:
(3.68) kikern
rneskep wi
oba- tirki lar- em
afternoon low tide 3n SgS RemPast-PlS-go on foreshore-Pf fish-All
'In the late afternoon low tide, they went on the foreshore for fish.'
(D6pem, p215, sections)100The remote past imperfective is formed by the prefix wa- and the present
(imperfective) suffix:
(3.69) wi
kikem kerker-ge pwaca wayrw- eda
3n SgA first
time- Loe pigO RemPast-eat-Prhnp£Pl
'They ate pig in former times a long time ago.'
(3.70) kikem kerker-ge gab i
waykeredi

'There used to be a path there.'
The remote past is formed by the prefix wa- and the past suffix:
(3.71) wi
obakyaware lar- em
3n SgS RemPast-Pauc/PlS go-PastPl fish-All
'They went for fish.' (D6pem, p215, sections)
Vowel Loss or Reduction.
When temporal/aspectual/mood/number markers commencing with a
vowel are suffixed to verb roots ending in a consonant, these trigger the loss of
the final vowel (except I a/) provided it does not lead to an unacceptable cluster
such as a tri-consonantal cluster (e.g. itmer 'ask'---> *itmr+i) or a 2-stop cluster
(e.g. ipit 'hit' ---> *ipt+er n Prlmpf):
V[-a] -> 0 I C - C + V
ex. dirup 'sweep'
--> derp + er n Prhnpf
--> dirp + iderwem IrrPauc
etaker 'pick up Pauc/PIO' --> etakr + eyey PrhnpfDual
--> etakr + eda Primp£Pl
isim 'cut Pauc/PlO'
-->ism+ iPf
--> ism + iyey PfDual
-> ism + idare P£Pauc
--> (a)-asr + e Futl
asor 'listen'
--> (a)-asr + ey Fut1Dual
--> (a)-asr + idare Fut1Pauc
--> (a)-asr +are Fut1Pl
Contrast with a verb root which has a final low vowel:
ex. erap 'buy Pauc/PIO' -> erap + i Pf
When temporal/aspectual/mood/number markers commencing with a
vowel are suffixed to verb roots ending in a vowel other than /i/, the root vowel
is reduced to a bilabial glide /w I or is deleted altogether:
1. V[-i] + --->
0
I C[+bilabial] - + i
-> ab + iyey PfDual
ex. abu 'fall'
--> im + iPf
imu 'knock'1012. V[-i] + -->w /-+V
ex. itu 'shave'--> itw + i Pf
-> itw + iyey PfDual
--> itw + idare P£Pauc
ero 'eat'
--> irw + iPf
-> irw + iyey PfDual
--> irw + idare P£Pauc
ero 'eat'
--> erw + er n Prlmpf
--> erw + eyey PrlmpfDual
--> erw + eda PrimpiPl
abu 'fall'
--> na-(a)bw + e Futl
--> na-(a)bw + am FutlDual
--> na-(a)bw + are FutlPl
Contrast with a verb root which has a high, front vowel:
--> iri + (i) Pf
ex. eri 'drink'
--> iri + (i)yey PfDual
-> iri + (i)dare P£Pauc
There are no verb roots ending in /e/ or /a/ and so the rules only have to
exclude I ii to capture the generalization. Rule 1. must be ordered before Rule 2.","[110, 111, 112, 113]"

should recall that most verb roots themselves, mark number distinctions. There
are three types of verb root: Sg/Dual versus Pauc/Pl, NonPl versus Plural, and
no number distinction. The prefix cross-reference markers are of two types:
Sg/Pl versus Dual/Pauc and, Sg versus NonSg. Because the prefixes and verb
roots have a different number opposition, the maximum distinctions for number
are achieved through a minimum number of forms. This is a highly economical
system of marking.
As verb roots' number distinctions carry predominantly number
information about the S or 0 arguments, it is important that suffixes carry
number information about the A argument; hence there is an extensive crossreference marking system in the suffix position contrasting singular, dual, paucal
and plural. However, as there are verbs which have number information that is
not restricted to a particular argument, it is the combination of markers and verb
roots themselves which achieve specific number distinctions.
3.11Non-Productive Derivations.
There are several morphemes used to signal meanings such as 'similar
type of action', 'transitiviser' and 'word formative'. Several language-internal
reasons contribute to their classification as derivations rather than inflections.
They are only semi-productive, unlike inflections. When they do occur, they
occur in all the forms inflected for tense/ aspect/mood including the 2nd person
future singular - a form of the verb that can be characterised as bearing no
inflection. They are always affixed to the verb root before any inflections and
thus are part of the lexical formation process rather than the syntactic process.
d- 'Similar type of action' Derivation.
There are variations in certain verbal forms differing only in the presence
or absence of an initial consonant Id/. This may simply be a phonemic
alternation not signalling a meaningful relation or it may be a meaningful
morpheme. However, this relation is somewhat obscured at a synchronic level,
possibly the result of diachronic development. The hypothesized morphemedhas no syntactic function in that derived verbs are of the same valency. The
process is not fully productive as not all verbs have the semantic alternation.
Some examples include:
water versus land?:
d-ereb 'dig'
ereb 'punt (a boat)'
land versus water?:
d-igwat 'fish i.e. pull in Pauc/Pl fish'
igwat 'pull, inhale'
d-emarge 'n Pl water vehicle,
emarge 'n Pl land vehicle,
be stationary'
be stationary'139similar type of action?:
etaw(e)rik 'go around something' d-etaw(e)rik 'turn something around'
ewer 'weave'
d-ewer 'build'
kar iruk 'build a fence'
kar d-iruk 'emprison' (lit: fence-erect)
ipit 'hit, kill'
op d-ipit 'meet' (lit: face-hit)
ikris 'scrape, scratch'
lumi d-ikris 'weed' (lit: weed-scrape)
erep 'rub together
d-erep 'mix'
such as for compost'
To characterize the relationship between the different forms as merely
'similar types of action' is inadequate and it would apply to many verbs whose
forms do not have related forms. Furthermore, there are verbal forms where the
same contrast exists phonemically but are obscure semantically, e.g. ikayret 'roast
on fire sg/dualO', and dikayret 'leave'.
i- Transitiviser Derivation.
There is a recurrent root initial vowel /i/ with transitive verbs) that may
correspond to a transitiviser morpheme, although it is not fully productive.
Consider the related pairs:
A=S:
ewtmer 'ask for something'
itmer 'ask someone'
S=O:
akaweret 'n PIS climb on'
ikaweret 'transport Sg/DualO'
ba-tir 'PIS climb on' (<etir 'get out'?)itir 'transport Pauc/PlO'
etrum 'n PIS come down'
itrum 'bring down Sg/DualO'
ewsmer 'Sg/DualS be born'
ismer 'give birth to Sg/DualO'
ews(-os) 'Pauc/PlS be born'
is 'give birth to Pauc/PlO'
espi(r) 'marry to someone, hide'
ispi(r) 'marry, hide something'
edug 'burn'
idug 'cause to burn'
This can only be stated as a tendency rather than a pervasive rule. There
are, for example, many transitive verbs which do not begin with the vowel /i/,
e.g. erap 'break Pauc/PlO'; dayu 'dig for Sg/DualO'. There are also intransitive
verbs which begin with the vowel /i/ and must be considered part of the verb
root, e.g. digem 'walk'; ditimed 'start'; ikarik 'come up to the surface of the
water'; igar 'speak'. There are instances where the transitive form of the verb has
a phonemically-related intransitive form but the relationship between the two
has been obscured or is not. at least to a European, transparent, e.g. ipit 'hit, kill'
(<epit 'blossom, flower'?). There are instances where no phonemically-related
intransitive form of the verb has been collected, e.g. ikris 'scratch, scrape (as in a
coconut)' (<*ekris).","[148, 149, 150, 151]"
"Language Oassification and Type.
Unlike its neighbour Kala Lagaw Ya, which is classified as an Australian
Paman language, Meryam Mir is classified by Wurm (Ibid) as a Papuan language
of the Trans-Fly stock with a close genetic relationship to the languages of the
Eastern Trans-Fly Family, Bine, Gidra and Gizra.
Its phonology is relatively simple, comprising a three way distinction in
point of articulation for oral voiced and voiceless stops (bilabial, alveolar and
velar) and a two way distinction in point of articulation for nasal stops and glides
1(bilabial and alveolar). The remaining consonants, a voiced and voiceless
fricative, a lateral and a rhotic tap, are all produced at the alveolar point of
articulation. The language has a five vowel system contrasting front and back
vowels /i, e/ and /u, o/ with a low central vowel /a/. The pitch-accent is
phonemically significant in the language, serving to distinguish certain lexical
items. Every word bears a high pitch on either the first or second syllable with
the majority of words carrying high pitch on the second syllable. The phonology
is covered in Chapter 1.
The following word classes can be distinguished: nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbs, deictics and interjections. Nouns and pronouns are
inflected for syntactic and non-syntactic cases. The cases are: ergative,
nominative, accusative, instrumental, allative (which includes some of the
functions of dative in other languages), ablative, locative, associative (which
could be labelled alternatively 'comitative') and genitive. There is a split case
marking system with an ergative case pattern on nouns for subjects of transitive
verbs and a nominative case pattern on pronouns for subjects of transitive or
intransitive verbs. Within the noun category, a distinction can be drawn between
common and proper nouns. With proper nouns, there is a three way split in the
case marking system with distinct inflections for the subject of a transitive verb,
the object of a transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive verb. Adjectives
as well as possessors marked by the genitive immediately precede the noun
which they modify and are thus syntactically dependent on the noun which is the
head.
Pronouns distinguish between first, second and third person with a further
distinction contrasting inclusion and exclusion for first person nonsingular. In
addition, there are distinct forms for the singular versus non-singular. There is
no gender distinction with third person. Word classes and nominals are covered
in Chapter 2.
Verbs can be categorised into two classes: atelic stative and telic active.
These classes are morphologically determined since the atelic stative verbs only
include intransitive verbs which mark the subject by means of a prefix, whereas
the telic active verbs mark either the transitive or intransitive subject
predominantly by means of a suffix. The two verb classes are partially
semantically motivated as suggested by the names atelic stative and telic active.
Verbal cross-reference markers encode information about both number,
distinguishing singular, dual, paucal and plural, and to some degree, person.
Time is divided up along the lines of present versus non-present where
present refers to events that occurred any time on the same day as the utterance
and non-present for events that occurred on another day or will occur following
the utterance. There are also aspectual features such as the imperfective and the
perfective. In addition, there is a mood marker, the irrealis non-committal,2which conveys the lack of commitment on behalf of the speaker to say whether
something will happen or not. Temporal, aspectual and mood categories, crossreference markers and other features of the verbal morphology are covered in
Chapter 3. Included in this chapter is a brief survey of adverbs, their formation
and function.
There is a rich and complex system of deixis in the language which is
explored in Chapter 4. Deictic markers' forms are determined by the temporal
occurrence of the event relative to the time of the utterance. Their function is to
essentially focus on various elements in space, time and in discourse itself.
Existential/locational verbs, intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs
form the basis of simple clauses. However, there are many events or states which
are expressed by complex verbal phrases consisting of a noun and verb with
nominals forming an essential part of the verbal's meaning. In such instances,
the whole verb phrase must be regarded as a complex head. There are no valency
changing operations except for an intransitiviser morpheme. A verb's valency is
more or less fixed with some non-productive morphemes affecting the verb's
transitivity and with periphrastic constructions for expressing inchoative and
causative meanings. Basic sentence types, verbal and nominal phrases as well as
some complex sentences are briefly examined in Chapter 5.
The following study is a sketch grammar of Meryam Mir with special
attention to verbal morphology and the system of deixis.","[12, 13, 14]"
"79CHAPTER THREE
VERBALS AND VERB MORPHOLOGY3.1Introduction.
Number marking is an important feature of verbs. There are crossreference markers and verb roots carrying number information about syntactic
arguments. Some roots are related to one another in form whilst others are
suppletive bearing no resemblance to one another.
(i) same form for all numbers:
detager
'tell'
erdar
'see'
badmirik 'chase oneself away'
ero
'eat'
iri
'drink'
ikasir
'be going along'
eme(r)
'nonhuman be sitting'
ekyam
'wake up'
ezo
'cry'
'climb'
og
Some of the verbs listed in this group (as in other groups) show slight
modifications in the verb stem such as initial vowel loss when certain prefixes
are affixed. For example, with the plural S morpheme b(a)-, there is a change in
the verb form with the deletion of the initial vowel, e.g. ekyam 'wake up', bakyam 'PIS wake up', i ezo 'cry' (lit: tear shed), i ba-zo 'PIS cry'.
(ii) suppletive forms for different numbers:
ikedi
'put down Sg/DualO'
ep
'carry Sg/DualO'
ikwar
'give Sg/DualO'
batawered 'throw SgO only'
itimed
'throw Sg/DualO'
ami
'put on Sg/DualO'
baw
'Sg/DualS enter'

Some verbs in this set have the penultimate vowel deleted in the
singular I dual form. This may be the result of historical changes where the
vowel became unstressed or the pitch-accent shifted to another syllable (parallel
to tabara-tabra-taba-tara '3Gen'):
akmey
'dip Sg/DualO' (?<akemey) akem 'dip Pauc/PlO'
ismi
'cut/ chop Sg/DualO' (?<isimi)isim 'cut/ chop Pauc/PlO'
For most verbs, the (paucal)/plural form is derived either by the loss of the
final vowel (plus consonant/ glide) or the loss of the entire syllable. In some
cases, other changes are involved such as the syllabification of the final glide, e.g.
ekw ---> eko, or the insertion of a glide in a root ending in a vowel, e.g. bakya--->
bakyaw. In some cases, a vowel is inserted to break up a word final cluster which
is unacceptable in the phonotactic structure of the language, e.g. etakr--->etaker,
or the medial consonant cluster is broken up and the consonants are
metathesized, e.g. diske --->dikes. The reductions are:

There are a few verbs whose related forms do not follow any familiar
pattern. (The underlying form is possibly a combination of both root forms.)
There are too few examples to generalize, only the type of changes can be
presented:
emri 'n PIS sit down'
Vmer 'PIS sit down'
(From the postulated underlying root emeri where there is deletion of the final
vowel for the plural form and loss of the mid vowel for the nonplural form.)

metathesized.)
imi- 'Sg/DualS be sitting'
emr- 'Pauc/PlS be sitting'
(From the postulated root emir where there is deletion of the final vowel for the
Pauc/PlS form and deletion of the final consonant for the Sg/DualS form.)IThere are some verb roots whose number reference alters depending upon
its meaning. This may be the result of idiosyncratic, isolated instances or it may
be a feature of specific meanings. For example, the transitive verbs itrum and
erap:
itrum 'take out from large opening Sg/DualO,
take off/down all no.0';
iti 'take out from large opening Pauc/PlO'
(3.1)
ka lewer itrumdari s6span-lam

"1.418In this study, the syllable has been arbitrarily selected as corresponding tothe following types. A syllable must minimally consist of a vowel:
V
o 'liver' VG aw 'big'
GV wi '3n Sg' GVG
way 'coconut seed'
CV pi 'dust' CVG pew 'wing' CGV Pyu name CGVG syaw 'sneeze'
VC op 'face' VGC Awm name GVC wir 'coal' GVGC ways 'take Fut3'
CVC pit 'nose' CVGClayp 'ear'
CGVCnyap 'thirst'CGVGC (no examples)
Some elaboration is required. The glides, at least with regard to the syllable
structure, need to be distinguished from consonants as glides can occur with
consonants in a word-initial and word-final cluster whereas a consonant cluster
(i.e. with no glides) is not possible in these positions. Consequently, I have
chosen to treat them as a distinct class in order to preserve phonotactic
generalizations. However, note that glides and consonants share features as one
would expect and it is sometimes arbitrary to label a sound sequence such as pew
'wing, flipper' of the type CVG rather than CVC. For reasons given above, the
distinction is best maintained. Any phonemic sequence that is longer than the
sequences listed is regarded as non-monosyllabic. Consider, for example:
way.su 'vagina'
ma.yu 'golden trevally'
mwey.ni 'woven mat for scooping things'
mak.rem - ma.krem 'unmarried male'
kim.yar - ki.myar 'married male'
i.k6s 'spear (verb)'
is.mi - i.smi 'cut Sg/DualO'
It is sometimes difficult to determine where the boundary lies between twosyllables. In such instances, ambisyllabicity must be assigned. This is the case
when there is a consonant cluster of two consonants or a consonant plus glide.
When there is a glide and consonant cluster, the glide is assigned to the previous
syllable and the consonant to the following syllable. H there is a single consonant
or glide, then it is typically perce·1ved as belonging to the syllable following.
In addition, affixed morphemes affect the type of syllable structure
permitted. To illustrate, consider the following sequence /ks/ found in sek+sek
'wrong, bad' (from the reduplicated form sek?). Compare this to the verb iski
'spear Pf' which is derived from the root ikos suffixed with the perfective
marker -i triggering final vowel deletion (parallel to the verb dirpi 'sweep '\'f '
derived from the verb root dirup). Thus, reduplication allows different
consonant clusters to those found at oiher morpheme boundaries.
1.5.1 Phonotactics.
The phonotactic structure of the language may be very generally stated as
follows. All single consonants, vowels or glides, can occur in word-initial and
final position except /rl, which cannot occur word-initially (see discussion below).","[29, 30]"
"181Deictic markers cover a wide range of functions. They are markers which
can contrast or highlight various elements of a sentence or utterance. Those
elements can be referents, events/states or entire propositions. The evidence
presented suggests that they are more discourse sensitive than syntax sensitive.
There is much overlap in function between what is described in many other
languages as switch-reference marking and these deictic markers. When they are
tracking referents, are they not marking these as being the same or different (or
new)? Furthermore, the correlation between temporal relations of switchreference systems and that of deictic markers' functions are again quite striking.
Switch-reference markers often indicate a temporal sequential and/ or
simultaneous relation with the previous clause parallel to the deictic markers)
although these often also include a logical relation with the previous clause.
It can be informally noted that the clauses with deictic markers pa and ga
generally involve a much tighter syntactic linkage with the antecedent clause
than deictic markers pe and ge. There are no instances in the data of pa and ga
occurring with a discourse initial clause. In contrast, markers pe and ge may or
may not occur with a discourse initial clause. Similarly, both markers i and ya can
occur discourse initially but only the marker ya marks a clause where the relation
to its antecedent clause is that of sequence or expressing some kind of logical
relation.","[192, 193]"

The analysis of Meryam Mir vowels remains to be undertaken and what
follows is more of an informal discussion. The high vowels /i,u/ do not sound
like cardinal high vowels and hence have not been placed in the far corners of
the vowel chart but in slightly lower and more central position~ ie. they sound
more like [-1.] and [G> ]. In addition, the high vowels can be said to have neutral lip
articulation for the front vowel /i I and only partial lip-rounding for the back
vowel /u/. Note that the non-high front vowel /e/ is a mid-vowel on the vowel
chart and is articulated somewhere in between [e] and [e:]. The non-high back
vowel /o/ is articulated more like cardinal vowel [J] but as there is no phonemic
contrast between [o] and [J], the symbol /o/ can be used. There is a central vowel
I a/. A full description of the vowels' allophones will not be undertaken in this
study.
There is a non-contrastive length distinction with all vowels tending to be
longer when they occur in accented initial syllable non-monosyllabic
phonological words. For example:
i:tmer 'ask'
i:ter 'sink'
a:kmey 'immerse'
a:bu 'go down'
6:mar 'good feeling'
6:ger 'go up n Prlmpf'
u:t eydi 'go to sleep' (lit: sleep lie)
e:rwer 'teach'
Contrast the above with the following monosyllabic words:
is 'pull out PIO'
14a conjunction
op 'face, front'
ut 'sleep'
ep 'carry SgO'
Parallel to this are words beginning with a consonant which may or may
not be lengthened when the accent is on the first syllable:
ki:kem - kikem 'afternoon'
ta:bo - tabo 'neck'
t-6:ger - t-6ger 'come up n Prlmpf'
Likewise with words in which the accented vowel is followed by a voiced
consonant, the vowel may or may not be lengthened:
ir+i:r 'soupy Adj'
lu gi:z 'ancestor' (lit: thing, tree-trunk, base)
era:r 'tiredness'
i:z 'groper' (compare with is 'take out PIO')
Compare:
dirsir 'prepare'
bar+bar 'crooked'
idim 'morning'
wag-em 'for wind' (lit: wind-All)
purud 'cover, shelter'
og+6g 'dirty'
The generalization can be formulated as follows: Accented vowels in word
initial position for non-monosyllabic words can be lengthened. Elsewhere the
accented vowel can be lengthened when followed by a voiced consonant.
There are several lexical items where the front vowels /i, e/ appear to be in
free alternation in unstressed position. This may be that there is some variation
in their realisation when they do not contrast and consequently there is no risk of
confusion. Hence, the varying orthography between Meryarn and Miryam.
Consider also:
omaskir- omasker 'children'
rnikir-mekir 'almond tree""
kirim-kerim 'head'
kila(r)+kila(r) 'strong'; kelar 'strength'
gilar-gelar 'law'
Nonetheless, one would not want to consider these as a single phoneme as
there are minimal pairs where they do contrast:
gim'illness'
gem'body'
mir 'word, language'
Mer 'Murray Island'
wit 'wrong-doing'
wet 'instrument used for skinning coconuts'15Ii 'faeces'
le 'person'
Furthermore, even when these are unaccented they can contrast:
etkir 'undress Plclothes' itkir 'rub off'
itrum 'bring down'
etrum 'come down'
imri 'seat'
emri 'sit down'1.3Pitch-Accent
Accent is distinctive in the language as words are contrasted according to
the particular syllable on which accent is placed. There are a number of minimal
pairs which contrast solely through accent placement. In the following examples,
the first set of disyllabic words have the accent on the first syllable whilst the
second, set have it on the second syllable:
~V-VV-Vtabo 'snake'
tab6 'neck'
kikem 'afternoon'
kikem 'initially, firstly'
u ni 'coconut juice'
uni 'fish sp.'
dikayr 'wait'
dikayr 'leave alone'
isi 'take out Pauc/PlO perf'
isi 'centipede'
bager 'type of spear'
bader 'PlS land'
What exactly is meant by 'accent'? There is no consensus amongst
linguists who have worked on the language as to what feature or bundle of
features mark the 'accent'. Bartos (1977) refers to the feature as 'stress' but fails to
characterize or define it. McConvell (1983) refers to it as 'pitch-accent' with the
accented syllable being the one carrying high tone/ stress on it. Rigsby (p.c)
maintains that an accented syllable may but need not have high tone.
In the current corpus of data, isolated lexical items collected through
elicitation have the accented syllable bearing high pitch:
umar village name
6mar 'good feeling'
apkorep 'habit, manner'
zyawali 'book'
imiredi 'be sitting Pr'
iperedi 'be lying'
dirsir 'prepare'
dirsi 'be moored'
kepkep 'few'
dobdob 'fat'
datrum 'cut n PlO'
itrum 'bring down'
However, when certain inflections or clitics are added or simply within
discourse, the accented syllable can shift place or the previous accent bearing
syllable will no longer carry high pitch:
ex.
legize
person-PIA
'people (A)'16>Wayer pitplacele gize
point person-PIA- -- _][ex.ex.'people of Wayer point'
kirgir 'youth', makrem 'unmarried man'
> kirgir makrem
[
-]
'male youth'
ereg 'eat flesh'
>ka able lar irgi
1SgA Det fishO eat flesh-Pf
[--]'I ate the fish'
Should the definition of accent be altered to include these alternations or
should the definition of accent remain correlated with high tone with details
given elsewhere as to its interaction with other features such as intonation? It
would seem more useful in a descriptive work to keep accent as a discrete
linguistic category specifying elsewhere the alternations.
Accent placement is restricted to the first or second syllable of a
phonological word. Thus, in disyllabic or polysyllabic words, there is a fall in the
pitch following the accented syllable:
ex.
bakyamu
[ - - -]
'Go!'ex.e bakyamu-da
[-ex.","[24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"
"44• whether this construction can occur with other case inflections.
There are morphophonological alternations with the associative suffix:
-ipkem-> -ypkem I Vex. ama-ypkem 'along with mothers'
I yex. ?Oy-ypkem 'in front of Oy'
-ipkem I elsewhere ex. Lez-ipkem 'in front of Les'
2.2.2 Syntactic versus Non-Syntactic Cases.
Criteria for distinguishing between syntactic and non-syntactic cases can be
established through the cross-reference markers on the verb. Arguments which
can be cross-referenced are: A, S and 0. The genitive may optionally be crossreferenced on the verb. Examples to illustrate cross-reference marking follow:
- cross-reference marking for S:1-----1
able neys werem ut
miwperedi
Det two childS sleepN 3n SgS-n PIS be lying-Prlmpf
'The two children are lying asleep.'
- cross-referencing for A (by a suffix):
(2.87)1------------------------1(2.88)wiable lu
erapeydarda
3n SgA Det thingO buy Sg/Dual0-P£Pl
'They bought the thing.'
- cross-referencing for 0 (by a prefix and suffix):
e
yabi
natakerda
3SgA 3n SgO 3n SgO-gather Pauc/Pl0-P£Pl
'He gathered them (mangoes) up.'
- optional cross-referencing to genitive:
(2.89)1------,abra
werem (d)- ewsmeda
3SgGen childS 3Gen- Sg/DualS born-PfSg
'His child is/was born.'
*werem dewsmeda
(Note the above ungrammatical example when the verb is cross-referenced for an
absent genitive argument.)
The cross-reference markers permit a distinction to be drawn between the
cases as follows:(2.90)45Non-Syntactic:
Locative
Allative
Ablative
Instrumental
Associative
(Genitive)
The genitive can be listed in both categories as it can optionally be crossreferenced, it only occurs with 3rd person genitive and it is used mostly to
disambiguate the lack of coreference between a possessor of 0 and A or the
possessor of an incorporated nominal and S (see the section 3.6 p95 on Genitive
Marker for 3rd Person).

(Genitive)2.2.3 Other Inflectional Affixes.
1)
The nonsingular suffix -iba/-ibi is added to a singular noun in a complex
phrase to indicate that it is a member of a group of two or more. For example:
(2.91) kari
omay-iba mari omay-ey wi
ba- regley
1SgGen dog- n Sg 2SgGen dog- Dual 3n SgS Intr-bite flesh-nPrlmpfDual
'My dog and your dog, they bit each other.'
(2.92) wi
Sigar-iba nardar-dare omaskir-kem
3n SgA S.n Sg 3n SgO-see- Pauc children-Ass
'They saw Sigar along with his children.'
(?They, Sigar and his children, got seen.)
As exemplified in the two sentences given above (2.91 and 2.92), -iba
merely indicates one of a group of two or more. There are no instances of this
suffix occurring with inanimate nouns. Could this be because speakers are less
interested in number reference with inanimates? Typically, with inanimate
objects, the nouns are simply juxtaposed:
(2.93) e
tabara sarik kep- kem giz- ge irmi
3SgA 3Gen bow arrow-Ass trunk-Loe stick Pauc/PlO into-Pf
'He stuck his bow along with his arrow into the base of the tree.'
(Dewmer, p209, sections)
There is one example (2.94.) collected with -iba suffixed onto an inanimate
noun but it is an example collected through elicitation and the genitive case is
used within the complex phrase, a feature which is not normally permitted:
(2.94) ?ma kara
sogob- iba masis-ey narapey0
2SgA 1SgGen ciggies-n Sg <Eng- Dual 3n SgO-buy Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
'Buy my cigarettes and matches.'
The -iba suffix has been classified as an inflection for the following reasons:46•
The apparent restriction against the genitive case co-occurring with it in its
full form (excluding the example just given above). This is a restriction parallel
to that for inflections:
(2.95) taba koskiriba omasker-kem
3Gen (married)female-n Sg children- Ass
'his wife along with his children'
(2.96) *taba-ra koskir-iba omasker-kem
Gen
•
A distinction in the form when affixed to a noun in a non-syntactic case,
namely -ibi. Thus, there are basically two forms for this affix: -iba for syntactic
cases and -ibi for non-syntactic cases. Here are some examples with the form -ibi:
(2.97) ka bakyamu- da Sigar-ibi uteb- em omasker-kem
lSgS Sg/DualS go-PfSg S.n Sg place-All children-Ass
'I went to Sigar and his children's place.'
(Note that in the above example 2.97, the -ibi phrase seems to be in a genitive case
function which could be interpreted as evidence of the genitive's fluid status as a
syntactic or non-syntactic case.)
(2.98) ... pa- ka ta- ba Irwered-ge Mesnare-ybi- (i)m Eydyana-ey
Loe M.n Sg-All E. Dual
Deix-lsgS Deix-go I.da-rabger-i
I -3n Sg0-1 call- Pf
' ... and then, I came to Irwered, to Mesnare and Eydyana's and invited
them.'
(2.99) Bewr pe eypu- ge irdi
Webok-ibi- lam a
Babud-ey
B. S Deix middle-Loe n PIS be(place) W.n Sg-Abl Conj B.Dual
'Bewr is half-way between Webok and Badud.'
There is no distinction between the A, S or 0 argument when the
nonsingular inflection is affixed. Thus, one can use this suffix with an A
argument (2.100) or with an S argument (2.101):
ey lewer ti- dikasr-eyey
(2.100) Lez-iba koskirL. - n Sg (married)female-Dual foodO Deix-cook- PrlmpfDual
'Les and his wife are cooking (there).'
(2.101) Lez-iba koskerey ta- bakyamu- daryey
L.- n Sg (married)female-Dual Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfDual
'Les and his wife came.'
There is some ambiguity caused by this lack of distinction. With an
intransitive verb, there will only be one core argument so the -iba phrase will
have to be S. With a transitive verb, the non-iba phrase will either have an overt
ergative case marker for A or it will be marked overtly for 0 if it is a pronoun or a
proper noun. The only instance where it will be ambiguous is when a common
noun is the 0 as this will be the -0 case marker with no way of distinguishing 0
47from A. Of course, word order can always be used to disambiguate. Here is an
example where the overt 0 case marker on the personal pronoun allows the
addressee to interpret the -iba phrase as the A:
(2.102) neti- (i)ba yabi nerwer-da?
who-n Sg 3n Sg 3n Sg0-teach-P£Pl
'Who(pl) taught them?'
There is some diachronic and synchronic evidence which suggests that the
suffix -iba is related to the pronominal plural genitive case form (see section 2.3
p68 on Pronouns for more details). The nonsingular genitive pronominal forms
which are relevant to this discussion are:
1n Sg Exel keriba
Incl meriba
2n Sg
waba
3n Sg
wiyaba I yaba
The nonsingular forms which all end in -(i)ba correspond closely in form
as well as in function to the nominal nonsingular affix -iba.
In addition, Ray in his study (1893) gives the following examples to indicate
a pair or a group:
(2.103) keriba
Pasi-ey bakyamuley
Dawar-em
1n SgExclGen P.- Dual Sg/DualS go-PastDual D.All
'We (exd dual), Passi and I, went to Dawar.'(lbid; 61)
(the glosses are my own)
(2.104) mi
merbitkem namrida
1n Sglnd ln SglndO-Ass
1/2Sg?-Sg/DualS sit down-PfSg
'We sat down in one another's company/You sat down along with us.'(?)
(Ibid; 64)
Although there are no examples in Ray's data of this construction being
used with nominals such as those given for modern Meryam Mir, the reader
should note that in at least one of Ray's examples, the plural genitive pronoun is
used to indicate the plural pair. This parallels the examples found in the presentday language where the -iba is affixed to nominals for similar effect.
The earlier Meryam Mir examples both differ and resemble modern
Meryam Mir with regard to pronominals. Like the earlier form of the language, a
nonsingular pronoun is required in this construction:
(2.105) ki
ama- ey bakyamu- daryey
1n SgExdS mother-Dual Sg/DualS go-PfDual
'We two, mother and I, went.'
(2.106) wi
ama- ypkem namreder
3n SgS mother-Ass
3n SgS-Pauc/PlS be seated-n Prlmpf
'They were seated, him along with the mothers.'
Note that if there is possession, it must be with the reduced form:48(2.107) kikerbi
ama- yey
ln SgExclS ln SgExdGen mother-Dual
'we two, our mother and I'
* ki kara amayey
lSgGen
* ki keriba
amayey
ln SgExclGen
* keriba amayey
'we two, mother and I'2)
The privative suffix -kak is added to (pro)nominals to indicate the absence
or the lack of something:
(2.108) e
barkak mir dike
3SgS crookedN-Priv word n PIS be(word)
'That is the right word.'
(lit: it is a word without crookedness)
(2.109) e

3SgS shame-Priv child n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a shameless child.'
(2.110) ka nole utkak n(a)- aIi
lSgS Neg sleepN-Priv 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'I am not sleepy.'
(lit: I am without sleep)
It can be used with pronouns or animate nouns as well to denote their
absence at a particular place:
(2.111) nole abi- tkak meta- ge irdiredi
Neg 3Sg0-Priv house-Loe n SgS be(place)-Pr
'He was not there at the house.'
(lit: There/It is without him at the house)
When it occurs within a noun phrase, it must precede the head noun and
the stem will operate in an adjectival or attributive function. As such, it might be
considered a derivation. For example:
ide abi epIi
(2.112) able mir- kak newrDet word-Priv unmarried female-A 3Sg0 carry Sg/DualO-Primpf
'The quiet silent girl is carrying him.'
Nominalised verbs can also be used with this affix:
a

(2.113) ese ma aspir- kak apu

ma n(a)- aIi...
2SgS 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf

Number Markers for 0 by Suffixes.
The previous section discussed how suffixes cross-reference A and S
arguments of telic verbs. However, these markers can also cross-reference 0
arguments provided these do not conflict with the number hierarchy which can
be very broadly summarized as Pauc/PlA/O > Sg/DualA/O; that is paucal or
plural number 0 arguments can take precedence in the number suffix slot over
singular or dual A arguments. In other words, we find examples of Pauc/PlO
animates being marked by suffixes when there 'are 5~/D~l A an;mates:

(DualO>non SingularA)
Several possibilities can be suggested to account for these. This use may
reflect changes happening in the language such as that documented by
McConvell (1983; 26) who notes that there is 'loss of the trial/plural number
distinction intransitives' amongst speakers under about forty years old and so,
the number hierarchy is sometimes not applied. (This is less likely to be the
reason given that both of these utterances were by speakers in their fifties and
above.) It may be that such features are more sensitive to pragmatic features or
that indefiniteness in number for A is tolerated when its number and identity
have been clearly established elsewhere. A larger corpus of data monitoring these
factors would be desirable.
In addition, the number hierarchy needs to be explored with respect to ditransitive verbs where there are potentially two O's competing for cross-reference
marking in the suffix slot. It can be tentatively stated that when this is the case,
the animate 0 will take precedence over the inanimate 0:
(3.218) peybri legize komet le
nam nakwarda
name person-PIA name personO turtleO 3n SgO-give Sg/Dual0-P£Pl
'The 'peybri' clan members gave the 'komet' clan members, a turtle.'
(The above example is interesting as it also illustrates how overt lexical number
marking for A will permit the cross-reference marking on the verb to include
number of A and 0.)
Although the hierarchy for animates over inanimates sugges1sa loss of
information for number of 0, the reader is reminded that forms of the verb roots
themselves often carry such information:133(3.219) peybri legize komet le
nam n(a)- ayswerda
name person-PlA name personO turtleO 3n SgO-give Pauc/PlO-PiPl
'The 'peybri' clan members gave the 'komet' clan members, turtles.'
Problems and Semantic Motivation for Conjugations 1. and 2.
The particular type of cross-reference marking used (i.e. from type 1. or type
2.) may also be carrying information about the 0 arguments. At first glance, the
different types appear totally arbitrary carrying no number information as
evidenced by the fact that both can occur with intransitive telic verbs:
e.g. bayter 'sink'
---> baytr-i 'SgS sink Pf';
ekyam 'get up'
---> ekyam-da(ri) 'SgS get up Pf';
---> bakyam-i 'PIS get up Pf';
bakyamu 'Sg/DualS go'
---> bakyamu-da(ri) 'SgS go Pf';
bakyaw 'Pauc/PlS go'
---> bakyaw-da 'PIS go Pf'.
Similarly, both types can occur with transitive telic verbs:
e.g. ero 'eat'
---> irw-i 'SgA eat Pf';
etomer 'show Sg/DualO' ---> etome-da(ri) 'SgS show Sg/DualO Pf'.
erap 'buy Pauc/PlO'
---> erap-i 'SgA buy PIO Pf';
---> erap-da 'PIA buy PIO Pf';
There is evidence, however, that at least in some cases, the inflections are
not arbitrary, but meaningful as they contrast with one another, within a single
verbal paradigm. With a couple of transitive verbs, the morphemes from
conjugation 1. -dari, -daryey, etc. always refer to singular or dual 0 arguments
(contrasting these with morphemes from conjugation 2. -i, -iyey, etc. which do
not refer to singular or dual 0 arguments). For example, the verb emarik 'send':
(3.220) ka
able netat zyawali emarik-dari
lSgA Det one bookO send- PfSg
'I sent the one book.'
(3.221) ka able zyawali emark-i
1SgA Det bookO send- Pf
'I sent the letters.'
(3.222) ka
wali
itrumda
1SgA clothingO take down-PfSg
'I took down my dress.'
(3.223) ka
kara
wali
itrumi
1SgA 1SgGen clothingO take down-Pf
'I took down my clothes.'
However, whilst there are only a few of these transitive verbs marking the
number of 0 arguments explicitly by contrasting conjugation markers 1. and 2,
there are many transitive verbs with related root forms where conjugation type1341, i.e. -dari, -daryey, etc, occurs consistently with singular I dualO. Here are a few
examples to illustrate:
irmida(ri)
(<irmi)
(3.224) ka netat pil
lSgA one <Eng swallow Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I swallowed the pill.'
(<irim)
i(3.225) ka pil irmlSgA <Eng swallow Pauc/PIO-Pf
'I swallowed the pills.'
(3.226) ka te
dimida(ri)
(<dimi)
lSgA doorO close Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I closed the door.'
dimi
(3.227) ka te
(<dim)
lSgA doorO close Pauc/PIO-Pf
'I closed the doors.'
erapeyda(ri)
(3.228) ka netat lu
(<erapey)
lSgA one thingO buy Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I bought one thing.'
(<erap)
(3.229) ka lu
erapi
lSgA thingO buy Pauc/PIO-Pf
'I bought things.'
Thus, there is evidence demonstrating a relation between singular I dualO
and verb markers from conjugation 1. Nonetheless, there remains a large corpus
of verbs where the claim is not borne out. Intransitive verbs cannot be carrying
information about the number of 0 as they do not have an 0 argument.
Similarly, there are transitive verbs which can only carry markers from
conjugation type 2, irrespective of the number of 0 involved. The following two
examples illustrate an intransitive and transitive verb from conjugation type 2:
(3.230) newr i
izw- i
(<i ezo)
girlS tear shed-Pf
'The girl cried.'
(<ewer)
(3.231) ka papek iwr- i
lSgA matO weave-Pf
'I wove a mat.'
The generalization can be formulated as follows: Only those verbs from
conjugation 1. express overtly singular/dual number for A or S through their
conjugation markers, i.e. through their morphology (and possibly through their
verb root form). Verbs from conjugation 2. generally have the same lexical root
for all numbers. Thus:
(<ezo)
ba- zw- i
(3.232) newr i
girlS tear PIS-shed-Pf
'The girls cried.'","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"
"Sociolinguistic Notes.
A special form of the language is used for grieving or expressing sympathy
for an individual. This speech style is called nas+nas rnir 'sorry talk' (lit: sad Adj
word) and only affects verbs by either changing the first vowel to /o/ or /u/ or by
inserting a bilabial glide between the initial consonant and vowel; e.g. dali 'be
Primpf' ---> dwali 'be Prlmpf in sorry talk'; digern 'walk' ---> dogern 'walk in
sorry talk' (see the section in Phonology on glides p. 10).
Whilst all Meryam speakers on Mer can talk some Creole, it is not the case
that all Creole speakers can talk Meryam. For this reason, community affairs are
generally conducted in Creole. For example, when council candidates were
giving their election speech during my stay, only one out of six candidates
delivered their speech in Meryam.
Furthermore, even with Meryam speakers, there is code-switching
depending upon the topic and addressee. In the family home, parents often
address their children in Creole, switching to Meryam when they want to discuss
something which does not concern them. However, many younger people in
their twenties and below, only have a passive knowledge of Meryam and,
consequently, always converse in Creole. It is only speakers in their mid-thirties
and above, with a sufficient grasp of Meryam, who can converse in it.
The language of education is English with Creole used informally in the
classroom for giving instructions or explaining difficult concepts. Meryam is
taught for only half an hour or an hour a week in the school and is funded by the
Commonwealth government.
The Creole spoken on Mer (and on the other Eastern Islands, see Shnukal
1988) does have a high proportion of Meryam lexical items. Similarly, speakers of
Meryam also employ Creole words although the proportion may vary
enormously from speaker to speaker and topic to topic. There are sometimes
preferences for words from a particular language and meanings can differ from
one language to another. For example, the Creole kinship terms sisi 'sister' and
bala 'brother' are used far more frequently than the Meryam term berbet 'sibling'.
An example of semantic shift is the instance of two children from one family
who use Creole terms rnarni 'mummy' and dadi 'daddy' for their parents and the
Meryam terms am.a 'mother' and bab 'father' for their grandparents instead of
the Meryam term kayed or ata for 'grandparent'.
Not all speakers of Meryam have the same command and knowledge of
the language and future research must aim at documenting the range and
differences in forms, functions and meanings comparing conservative Meryam
and Creole.",[16]
"171When it is 3rd person, the situation is somewhat more complex and
speakers have different opinions on what is acceptable or not. Some speakers
allow all three markers i, ya and ge to mark a place distant to the speech act; some
speakers only allow the markers i or ya to mark distance from the speech act,
which suggests that the notion of distance is not crucial to their meanings, and
some speakers only allow the marker ya to mark distance from the speech act:
(4.105) ?e

'He will be there so go see him there.'
(The speaker is telling the addressee after he has been to see the person
and told him to stay there.)
It is obviously not on the basis of so few examples that one can make hard
and fast generalizations but there is at least scope for suggesting direction of
change. What all speakers do agree on is that the form i is associated with a place
close-by and a time in the immediate future:
(4.108) ka mena ika n(a)- awer
lSgS still Deix-lSgS 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-n Prlmpf
mari nawkayr-er
2Sg01/2Sg0-wait- n Prlmpf
'I will stay here now (and) wait for you.'
The form ya is associated wih a distant place or a later time (see later section
on ya for evidence of this):
(4.109) ka ya- ka na- bakyamu- lu
idimge
lSgS Deix-lSgS Futl-Sg/DualS go-FutlSg morning-Loe
'I will go there tomorrow.'
The form ge is used with 1st or 2nd person and a specific location (see
examples 4.110 - 4.112).
Some speakers are re-analysing i in terms of a temporal feature alone, i.e. it
only refers to a proximate time and it does not matter where the event takes place
The marker ya is not undergoing any change and refers to events that are either
distant in time or space. The marker ge is undergoing some kind of change
although the precise nature of the change is unclear; it is possibly starting to be
regarded in terms of a modal marker, i.e. I know this definitely will happen.","[182, 183]"
"110There is typically no distinction in form between 2nd person future and the
imperative (see section on Irrealis Non-committal for further specifications p117):

With telic verbs, the nonpresent imperfective and future contrast with one
another to indicate that the former is an event to be repeated whilst the latter will
be a single complete realisation of the event, i.e. perfective and semelfactive.
Consider the following contrastive sentences:

Rules for allomorphy.
na- future 1st person
na- intransitive verbs
a- transitive verbs
If intransitive verb roots begin with (a I di and) an unaccented vowel, these
are deleted when there is the future 1st person marker na-. If transitive verb
roots begin with a I di, it is metathesized with the future 1st person marker a-.
The initial unaccented vowel of transitive verbs is deleted after the future 1st
person marker a-:
For intransitive verb roots:
underlying form: na+ (d)V[-accent] ---> 0 I na[futl] + -- [intr.vb.root]
For transitive verb roots:
underlying form: a + 1. a[futl] + d--- [tr.vb.root] ---> da + -- [tr.vb.root]
2· v[-accentl --> 0 I (d) a [futl] + --(metathesis)(Rule 1. must be ordered before Rule 2.)
ex. na-bakyamu-lu (<bakyamu) 'Futl SgS go'
na-gm-e (<digem) 'Futl SgS walk'
ex. a-marik-lu (<emarik) 'Futl send SgO'111d-a-kayret-lu (<dikayr) 'Futl leave SgO'
wa- (all homophonous forms)
When transitive verbs begin with a front vowel, this vowel is reduced to a
glide following the prefix wa-.
#V[ +front]
-> y I wa + ex. wa-yrap (<erap) 'Fut3 buy';
wa-yrpey (<erpey) 'Fut3 strike';
wa-ysamey (<esam) 'Fut3 put out';
wa-yro (<ero) 'Fut3 eat'
wa-ymri (<imri) 'Fut3 seat';
wa-yspi (<ispi) 'Fut3 marry';
wa-ytuti (<ituti) 'Fut3 touch';
Allomorphic variations for the prefix wa- are as follows:
I - V[-front]
ex. way-atrum 'Fut3 suggest'
wa- ->wayway-omey 'Fut3 grow'
way-urid 'Fut3 PlS be(person)'
(This is the only verb collected beginning with /u/ and it sometimes occurs as
[wa-wrid] i.e. the /y/ glide is being labialized as a result of the back, high vowel
/u/ following or it may be that /u/ of the verb root becomes wafter the prefix
/wa/.)
->wey--wI - V[ +front] (intransitive verbs only)
ex. wey-emri-w-emri 'Fut3 sit down'
wey-espi-w-espi 'Fut3 get married'
->wex. w-ays 'Fut3 carry Pauc/PlO'
I - Vglide
-->oex. o-ber-are 'Fut3 PIS become'

ex. o-na-kwar-wa-na-kwar
--> o--wa/-Ca
'Fut3 give 1/2Sg0'
->waI elsewhere
ex. wa-ditager 'Fut3 tell'
wa-yker (<iker) 'Fut3 do'
An interesting feature of the allomorphic variations of wa- and na- is the
interaction between phonological and syntactically-motivated rules; i.e. with wa-,
the front vowel of a transitive verb is reduced to a glide before the prefix like the
accented vowel of an intransitive verb (See the allomorphs of accented vowels
presented in the section on the verb structure p92). In contrast, an intransitive
verb with a front unaccented vowel is not reduced to a glide.","[121, 122, 123]"
"140One pair of verbs has been recorded where the alternation between the
intransitive and transitive form involves the sequence I di/. It corresponds to the
same transitiviser process with the addition of the consonant:
epigerner 'change'
dipigerner 'change, turn over'
e- 'Word Formative' Derivation.
As the reader may have noted from the examples cited above, there is a
high correlation of telic verbs, both transitive and intransitive, whose roots or
stems begin with /e/. It may be that verbs have phonotactic restrictions in their
occurrence in having to commence with (d)V. As a consequence of this
restriction, verbs that begin with a non-permissible consonant are prefixed with
the formative I e/.
The plural intransitive telic prefix ba- and the formative e- are mutually
exclusive, e.g. ewrni 'n PIS die' and ba-wrn 'PIS die'. Similarly, the intransitiviser
ba- and the formative e- are mutually exclusive, e.g. erap 'break' and ba-rap 'be
broken'. Here are some transitive and intransitive verbal forms (see also
examples from the transitiviser section):

It is unclear what the affix marker -dar- means. It may be from the paucal
number suffix or from an old auxiliary. In some cases, it appears completely
lexicalised to the meaning of the verb, e.g. er-(dar-) 'watch' where all verbal
inflected forms occur with the affix -dar-: a-r-dar-e Fut1, er-dar-i Pf, er-dar-iyey
PfDual, er-dar-dare P£Pauc, er-dar-da P£Pl, but consider its nominalised form: irem 'to watch' (lit: see-All). In some cases, it is only found on the paucal/plural
forms of verbs, e.g. upi diti 'help Sg/DualO', upi diti-dar- 'help Pauc/PlO', but
consider the nominalised form: upi a-ti-dar-em 'to help'. In some cases, it occurs
optionally with nonpresent durative inflections, e.g. ewsmer 'Sg/DualS come
out', ewsme-dar-er - ewsmer-er n Prlmpf, but ewsme-li Prlmpf, *ewsme-da(r)-li,
e~g. ekyam 'wake up', ba-kyam-er - ba-kyam-dar-er PIS n Prlmpf:

In some cases, it is obligatorily suffixed with all durative type inflections:
e.g. b-aw 'Sg/DualS go in', b-a-da(r)-li Prlmpf, *ba-li, b-a-dar-er n Prlmpf, *ba-r-er;
mir atrum 'suggest Sg/DualO', atrum-da(r)-li PrlmpfSg, *atrum-li.
Whilst it is not possible to predict when it will occur, it is possible to see a
recurrent meaning associated with the suffix, namely that all events are nonpunctiliar as they are either extended in time, repeated several times or over a
long time period. It may be that it is historically derived from a non-punctiliar
derivational morpheme.
Adverbs.
There are only two words which occur exclusively as adverbs. These are
nab '(attempt) unsuccessfully' and mirem 'try':

Other words have been collected functioning as adverbs. These could
exclusively be adverbs as they have not been found functioning in any other

Number Markers for S of Intransitive Telic Verbs by Prefixes.
Some intransitive telic verbs carry plural number information by means of
a prefix ba-. Those verbs marking plurality by means of a prefix (as opposed to a
suffix) are all predictable insofar as they all begin with a vowel in their
(underlying) verb root:
b- 6g- i

'They came down.'

Complications arise from the fact that this marker is homophonous with
the intransitive marker ba- and it is sometimes used to mark both functions or one or the other:

linguistic evidence to either refute or support such a claim.
Although it is not possible to isolate these words as being uniquely or even
primarily an adverb, their function is clearly adverbial. Adverbs contribute

As can be noted from the examples, adverbs covered in this section do not
have any inflections or affixes. (Adverbial phrases do occur as illustrated in the
section on inflections). Their position is relatively free in the sentence although
they tend not to occur in word initial position.
Several of the words used adverbially appear in reduplicated form. This
might be done for two reasons. It may be to derive an adverb from a noun, i.e.
dudum-ge 'in haste' (lit: haste-Loe), dudum+dudum 'quickly'; nyay-em 'forever'
(lit: long time-All), nyay+nyay 'eternally'. Note that since this parallels
reduplicated forms for adjectives, reduplication could be viewed as a syntactic
144process for deriving nouns into modifiers, be they adjectives or adverbs.
However, somewhat similar to adjectives, reduplicated adverbs also imply a
greater intensity, i.e. mayk-e 'dose-by' (lit: close-Loe) versus mayk+mayk 'very
dose-by'. Thus, reduplication is both a syntactic and semantic process for adverbs
as well.","[154, 155, 156]"

'He indicated (it) to her.'

The allative case can also be used to indicate the end point of a state which
has not yet been reached:
ama

1SgGen mothers dieN-All do- Prlmpf
'My mother is dying.'
(2.46) able kaba

Det bananas ripeness-All do- Prlmpf
'The banana is ripening.'
In the above two examples (2.45 and 2.46), the allative case is extended in
meaning from change towards a place to change towards an end point.
Like the locative case, the allative case is extended from a spatial to a
temporal meaning. When the allative case is used temporally, it marks a point in
time which has not yet been reached:
(2.47) e

'I will leave it until morning I for the morning.'
(Note: contraction of word, idim 'morning, tomorrow'+ em 'allative'---> idmem)
The variations in the form of the allative case, i.e. -im/-em, do not appear
to be phonologically conditioned and words taking the form -im appear as
irregularities.
Most words take -em:
(2.49) nor-em 'to the reef'
lar-em 'for fish'
kiy-em 'until tonight, for the night'
ut-em 'to/for sleep'
uteb-em 'to the place'
nal ug-em 'what for?'
Contrast this with the handful of words below taking the suffix form -im:
(2.50) gur-im 'to the sea'
ur-im 'onto the fire i.e. for roasting'
ged-im 'to home/land'
nagad-im - naged-im 'where to?'","[48, 49]"
"Personal Pronouns.
Personal pronouns are free forms which can be distinguished from proper
and common nouns on a semantic basis because they are shifters. They can be
distinguished from nouns on a morphological basis distinguishing A/S from 0.
The pronominal paradigm is as follows:
Genitive
kara
1Sg
keriba
ln SgExcl
meriba
ln Sglncl
,
mara
2Sg
waba
wabi
2n Sg
abra
abi
3Sg
wiyabi-yabi
wiyaba-yaba
3n Sg
The underlying forms for non-A/S cases are basically the 0 forms except for
the exclusive and inclusive forms where a vowel /i~ which breaks up the
consonant cluster, can be postulated, e.g. kerbi (< keribi) 'ln SgExcl', and merbi
(?<meribi) 'ln Sglncl'. This underlying vowel is deleted for all other cases. To
form the genitive, the final vowel is deleted and replaced by the vowel I a/ and
/ra/ for 3rd person singular (?<ra Genitive).
A/S
ka
ki
mi
ma
wa
e
(w)i0
kari
kerbi
merbi
mari68The alternations in the nonsingular forms for 3rd person are said by
speakers to be variations where wi, wiyabi, wiyaba represent older forms of the
language and i, yabi, yaba more recent forms, having had the initial glide or
syllable deleted, i.e. wi --> i, wiyabi --> yabi, wiyaba --> yaba. Thus:
(2.243) ka
yabi (-wiyabi) da-ratager-da
lSgA 3n SgO
I -3n SgO- I tell- PfSg
'I told them.'
In the genitive form for 3rd person, there are other forms which signal coreference between the possessor and the A/S argument of the sentence (i.e. a kind
of genitive reflexive). The forms are tabara-tabra- taba- tara. The alternations
are a reduction in the medial syllable,i.e. tabara --> tabra---> tara, taba. Here are
some examples:
ge urder

'Les shaved his (someone else's) beard.' (cf. 3.53)

following suffixes:
Locative
-doge
Allative

Ablative
-alam (for singular pronouns)
-lam (for nonsingular pronouns)

Privative -tkak

4)
The intensifier -kar is affixed to nouns to indicate the superlative of the
type, the most characteristic. As examples were given earlier, these will not be
repeated.
Examples need to be elicited with case inflections to see whether these are
grammatical or not:
? ukar- ide kari napit-i
coconut-Intens-A lSgO 1/2Sg0-hit-Pf
'The actual palm tree hit me.'
With this affix, some stems are inflectional, others are lexicalised.
Consider:
(2.128) !ewer
'food'
-kar
'intensifier'
lewer-kar 'type of yam' (lit: real food)
2.2.4 Derivations.
1)
There is a derivational suffix -kem homophonous with the associative case
suffix which derives adjectives from nouns. Whether or not this is a productive,
semi-productive or lexical device remains to be seen as only two examples have
been collected so far. Its meaning can be roughly glossed as 'characterised by' or
'having the characteristic of':
(2.129) mir- kem le
word-Ass person
'a preacher'
(2.130) ged- kem le
land-Ass person
'land-owner'
2)
Nominals (both nouns and adjectives) can be derived from verbs through
a regular phonological process which involves the initial (consonant plus) vowel
of the verb changing. Some examples of nominalised verbs being used as an
adjective or noun follow:52(2.131) e
o- bakyamu lewer arap- em
3SgS Fut3-Sg/DualS go foodO buyN-All
'He will go buy food.' (cf. 2.39)
(2.132) akasir+akasir lu
ikeredi
cook Adj
things n PIS be(thing)-Pr
'(It)'s a cooking utensil.'
As the reader may have noted, the adjectival derivation process can
involve reduplication as well although it is still the same process:
erap 'buy' verb --> arap noun
dikasir 'cook' verb--> akasir noun
The derivational process is as follows:
verbs--------------> nominals
The initial consonant, if there is one, is deleted.
A stressed word initial vowel /6/ becomes /aw/:
#(C) 6 -------- > # aw
An example is:
6g 'climb'--> awgog 'the climb' (as well as reduplication of verbal root?)
(the derivation might be from: aw(g) 'big'+og 'climb')
A stressed word initial vowel /f/ becomes I ay I when it is followed by a single
consonant and /i/. It becomes /aw/ elsewhere:
#(C) r - - - - > #ay / - c 1 i
------->#aw I elsewhere
Examples include:
dfmi 'close'---> aymir+aymir 'closed Adj'
dfski 'open'---> awskir 'tombstone opening'
(Note that verbs ending with a vowel have /r/ suffixed as well.)
A stressed word initial vowel I e/ becomes I a/ if it is followed by a glide and it
remains the same elsewhere:
#(C) e -------> #a I - c [+glide]
----------> #e I elsewhere
Examples include:
ewsmer 'go out, be born'---> awsmer 'birthday'
eydi 'lie down'---> aydir+aydir lu 'mattress'
erwer 'learn'---> erwer meta 'school' (lit: learnN+house)
(One counter-example has been collected in the data where ew -----> #ew,
e.g. ewmi 'die'---> ewd+ewd 'deadly' *awd+awd. However, as the derivation
also involves a change in the consonant, i.e. m ---> d, this could be an irregular
or unrelated form.)53A stressed word initial I a/ remains the same:
#(C) a. ---------->#a
An example follows:
akem 'dip'---> akem 'dippingN'
An unstressed initial vowel becomes I a/:#(C)V ------------>#a
Examples include:
dirmisir 'start'---> armisir 'beginning'
ero 'eat'---> aro+aro 'edible'
akarik 'land'--> akarik 'landing'
okayret 'break (of dawn)'---> akayret 'daybreak'
erap 'buy'--> arap le 'vendor'
dikasir 'cook' ---> akasir le 'cook'542.2.5 Nominal Compounds.
Many examples occur in the data of several nouns juxtaposed within a
single phrase. The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that these are
compounds and can be categorised into different types, lexical and syntactic. A
comparison will be made between compounds and modified nominals as well as
complex noun phrases involving the genitive construction, to show similarities
and differences. Compounds are the result of a morphological or lexical process
whereas modified nominals, be they adjectives or genitive constructions, are the
result of a syntactic process.","[62, 63, 64, 65, 66]"
"149In the above example, it is not the contrast between the noun phrases whichtriggers the different forms but the different time reference. This is illustrated by
the following example where the two noun phrases are contrasted but the forms
do not alter as the states coincide with the time of the speech act:
(4.3)
kcira
bawr pe ilce
1SgGen spearS Deix n PlS be(thing)
nole able le
pe t- ilce
Neg Det one/persons Deix Deix-n PlSbe(thing)
'This is my spear, not that one.'
The same marker ge is used with events or states that occur following the
speech act or at least continue on after the time of the utterance. Although there
are no examples contrasting present and nonpresent within a single sentence,
there are elicited examples which show the ungrammaticality of using a present
marker in a nonpresent context:
(4.4)
ma ge emrie
2SgS Deix Sg/DualS sit down-Fut 2/3

*ma pe emri
(4.5)
ma ge nami
daw(w)a
2SgS Deix 1/2SgS-n PlS be seated n PlS be(person)-Irr
'Remain seated there.'
*ma pe nami dawa
There are a number of features and functions associated with the markers
pe and ge which are examined below.
4.2.2 pe,ge1)pe, ge - new location
The markers are often exploited to focus on a new location or to mark a
contrast with a previous location. Speakers comment that the place is often
indicated through gesture. Here are some examples with pe to illustrate this
meaning:
(4.6)
irmer ni
pe emgedi

'The rain water (tank) is here.'

idimge key wa- ta- ba
morning-Loe way Fut3-Deix-go
'He is there in Cairns, he will be coming back in the morning.'
Several facts emerge from the examples. The deictic marker does not
indicate relative proximity or distance to the speaker I speech act because the same
marker can be used whether the speaker is pointing to a place close-by or referring
to a place away from the speech act. Relative distance is marked by the deictic on
the verb t(V)- . The deictic marker denotes a place that either the addressee was
not focussing on previously or a place where the referent was not situated before
or only after some point in time and thus can be regarded as a new location.
These examples could also be interpreted as having a presentative/locational
function, Le. 'there is X', or 'Xis/was there'.
With the non-present, the presentative function is absent and the
nonpresent marker ge is used to indicate a new place or one which the addressee
has not been focussing on. Here are some examples with ge to illustrate its
meaning:
(4.11) ma ge emrio
2SgS Deix n PIS sit down-Fut2/3

'He kept on cutting down light things (wood) (and) throwing them into

(An important point to note from the above example is the use of 3rd person
singular pronoun in the second clause: e-ge ... which does not in fact correlate
with the S/ A of the verb in terms of number, i.e. it is marking plural instead of
singular. One would expect to have a nonsingular pronoun. This might lead one
to suspect that it is not the pronoun being marked by the deictic but the event,
clause or even the whole proposition. More about this will be said shortly.)
The use of the deictic markers to focus or contrast referents is further
exploited to introduce a clause that makes the referent specific, i.e. it is used as a
kind of restrictive relative clause marker. It would be premature to label such
constructions as restrictive relative clauses without having undertaken a full156study of complex sentences and such a study is beyond the scope of this work.
However, such a use should be noted and can be exemplified:

5)pe, ge - focus on different proposition
There are examples where the deictic markers cannot be readily identified as
focussing on specific referents but rather on whole propositions.1 either in the form
of a single predicate proposition or of a multi-predicate proposition.

(Dewmer, p212, section18)6)pe, ge - logical relation
Many of the instances of deictic markers serving to focus on referents or
propositions involve a relation of logical dependency. This logical relation might
be, at the very least, a temporal relation marking a sequence or partial overlap
between one proposition and the previous one (such as in the t.lCatortes quoted
above) but sometimes it indicates a result/ consequence:

'The father along with the daughter tried in vain to go against the wind
but the wind only blew their boat (further) away from their island.'
(Dewmer, p208, section4)159It may be that the logical relationship established between two referents orpropositions is the result of inference and not part of the meaning proper of the
deictic markers themselves. This is an area requiring further investigation.
4.2.3 pa,ga
1)pa - relative to present time/ space; ga - relative to nonpresent time/ space
The same temporal distinctions as pe and ge serve to contrast the related
deictic markers pa and ga which can both be defined roughly as having the same
referent or event/state as a previous proposition. The difference between pa and
ga lies in their temporal reference. Pa is restricted to the present, ga to the
nonpresent as defined earlier. Note that the marker pa can include states which
began earlier than the day of the speech act and remain current at the time of the
speech act utterance. The following examples illustrate the time distinctions:

The reason for the ungrammatical sentence given above is that the present
deictic marker pa conflicts in its temporal reference with the future event.
An example where the present deictic marker is suitable follows:
