"32.4.2. Rhetorical questions. Rhetorical yes-no questions with emphatic my are
extremely common in Ingush discourse; see §33.2.1 for their functions and several examples.
Very often my VERB=ii functions almost as a definiteness marker or reminder of common
knowledge that explains or justifies what the speaker says.

(0398B.1)
A rhetorical yes-no question without my indicates that the hearer probably knows the identity
of the referent, and sometimes elicits a nod or affirmation from the listener. Often such a
phrase is followed by a repeat of its subject without the interrogative verb:

this; other examples are in §31.6.","[737, 738]"

QUESTIONS, ANSWERS, REBUTTALS
32.1. Polar (yes-no) questions
In polar questions the verb is followed by the interrogative clitic =ii. Word order in these
questions is generally verb-second. The interrogative clitic opens the preceding syllable and
undoes present-tense vowel shortening in verbs such as {tuox} 'strike' and {d.iesh} 'read'.
Present
Interrogativetox
tuox=ii?
'strike'desh
diesh=ii?

'know'After a vowel or diphthong the clitic is reduced to {j}, turning the vowel into a diphthong.

clitic.228

'know'A verb form ending in schwa plus the interrogative clitic ends in /ii/, and it is difficult to say
whether the -ii has replaced the schwa or has been reduced to {j} after the schwa (so that the
sequence of schwa plus -j produces /ii/ by schwa tensing: see §3.2.4).

'is'The clitic has prominent high pitch (so prominent that perhaps it might be analyzed as having
secondary stress) except that in tenses with high tone on the ending (witnessed past and
nonwitnessed) the ending keeps its high tone (which is not as high as the usual high pitch of
the interrogative clitic) and the interrogative clitic is lower in pitch than the ending, but higher
than a postverbal pronoun would be. The prosody is shown schematically in (1), where the
horizontal lines in indicate the pitch height. As these examples show, a postverbal subject has
the same low pitch after the interrogative clitic as it has after any verb form.","[729, 730, 731, 732]"
"---------diishâr=ii wa?
read.WP=Q 2s.ERG
'did you read?'229diishâr wa
read.WP 2s.ERG
'you read'In tense forms not carrying a high-tone ending, I have recorded the high tone of the
interrogative citic variously on the clitic and on the preceding syllable: {tuox=ii} 'strike?'
tuôx=ii ~ tuox=îi. On monosyllables the sole syllable includes the clitic and has high tone:
d=îi 'is?', d=ôi 'does it make? do they make?', etc.
The answer to a yes-no question is generally just the finite verb form, optionally with any
additional words needed for expansion on the answer. The subject can be included
(postverbally, and often with slight a pause before it). Less often, the entire clause can be
repeated. The particle aa 'no' can preface one of the more elaborated replies. (Ha'a 'yes' is
not used often in answers, though it is sometimes used in affirmations (§32.6).) Emphatic
deara can be clause-initial or follow the verb. Here and below, A and B lines are the different
speakers in a dialog. (2B) shows a number of possible answers.

Or: ""It's called slate."" ""You know what slate is? Slanec, chernyj slanec."" As an indication
of how endangered Ingush is, in this conversation between fluent speakers explaining and defining

apparatus of knowledge is associated only with Russian.

"29.7. Null pronominals
Ingush is not a pro-drop language. It can be seen in the texts in Chapter 35 that most clauses
have all arguments overt. However, null anaphora is systematically used in contexts where
the clause-to-clause connection is close and recoverability of reference guaranteed by both
syntax and sense. One such context is question-and-answer sequences and similar shortresponse dialog, where pronouns referring to the speakers are usually omitted, as in (5)-(8) in
§35.3 where the verbs eannad 'said' have no overt subjects. These are finite verbs; null
anaphora is very common with subordinating converbs (§13.9, Chapter 27, §29.2 above).
In Ingush many sentences lack an overt S or (as seems to be much more frequent) A and
the subject is generic or unspecified. Often these are comparable to French on, German man,
or Russian subjectless verbs with third person plural morphology, meaning an unspecified or
generic human agent, e.g. (21) in Chapter 11 (where there is no overt A with koradead
'found') or (85) in Chapter 20 (where c'i tillaai 'named (him)' has no overt A). The German
and French pronouns and the Russian agreement identify a human referent, but the Ingush has
no overt marking (the ergative A is simply lacking and this of course has no effect on the
agreement or case assignment in the clause) and does not necessarily imply human agency as
in (177), where something happened or was done to the second person but it is unknown
whether it was done by humans:
(177) Fy dead
hwuona?
what D.do.NW.D 2s.DAT
What happened to you?
For such examples it is difficult or impossible to know whether there is a null unspecified or
generic A or there is no A at all and the verb is ambitransitive. (See §21.2.7 and the footnote
there.) More research is needed on the question: if A's are freely omissible and most putative
transitive verbs are actually ambitransitive, then this is another profoundly ergative trait in the
lexicon and syntax of Ingush.",[691]
"16.2.3.5. Parentheticals. These are various words clarifying the logical and pragmatic
status of words and phrases, and they usually have words or phrases in their scope; unlike
conjunctions, they do not link clauses. For more on their properties see §5.6.3.

syntactically a headless relative. The word dwaara-d.ar 'that one over there', shown in the

Clefting uses a headless relative clause formed with a nominalized participle functioning
as argument or adjunct nominalization ('the one who …', 'the one that…'). Clefting is often
used in questions, where the focus of interrogation is on the interrogative word and the rest of
the clause (the predicate and its other arguments) is nominalized. It is especially frequent
when the interrogative word would be in an oblique case if clefting were not used. In texts it
occurs almost always where the questioned word would be ergative, and also frequently
where it would be nominative (subject or object). There are almost no text examples of (what
would be) oblique cases, adverbials, etc., questioned, but they could easily be elicited. In
(12)-(16) the interrogative word would be nominative if not clefted (i.e. if subject of loqar,

Content questions often involve clefting (§28.7). Clefting is common when the
interrogative word is a case-inflected word (notably, mala 'who') and is near-obligatory when
the case would be ergative. In clefting, the interrogative word is a predicate nominal with
'be', hence in the nominative case. The interrogative word (with cliticized 'be') is usually
either final or initial. Initial position generally suggests focus or emphasis on the
interrogative word; final position topicalizes the initial constituent.230

"The witnessed past ending -âr carries high tone while the homophonous ending of the

tone in others:

'used to send (him), used to have (him) go' (go.CSind.IMPF)On a long vowel as in (33) the tone is a clear rise on the tonic syllable and fall on the next.
The three enclitics listed above (the chaining particle, coordinating enclitic, and
interrogative enclitic) have the high tone, but other enclitics such as the contrastive particle
=m and the cumulative focus particle =q do not. Therefore, though Ingush cannot be said to
have a tone opposition of even a minimal sort, it does seem to have a contrast between
presence and absence of tone on some clitics and suffixes (but, interestingly, no major-class
root morphemes have lexically contrastive tone).
The mild imperative ending -l also carries high tone which surfaces on the preceding
vowel. Native speakers mostly consider the high tone of the mild imperative to be the
question intonation contour and optional, but in natural speech it seems to be invariably
present.

"Clefting is also frequent in non-questions, where it is triggered by focus. The focused
word usually moves to the end of the clause and rest of the clause (the verb and the other

in most text examples the focal word would be nominative or ergative if there were no
nominalization, but the full range of other cases and functions can be elicited. In (29)-(32)
the focused word would be nominative (subject of d.oal 'go', d.aagha 'sit', and d.y 'be', object

13.6.5. Introspectives: the postverbal particles -hwogh, -tesh, -tie. All three of these particles
are written hyphenated to the verb they follow, but phonologically and syntactically they
appear to be no less independent words than joax or hwuona (§§13.6.1-3 above), which are
never written with a hyphen. They are more or less synonymous introspective interrogatives
that can be rendered 'I wonder whether' (often with an implication that the speaker hopes the
complement is or will be true) and are used almost exclusively in questions (including
interrogative complements) and almost never on negative forms.
In main clauses hwogh is used most often in questions, where the sense is 'I wonder
whether…', 'I wonder what…', etc. It looks like a form of the second person singular
pronoun, but in natural text examples it seems that the speaker never expects the hearer to
have the answer.

30.4.2. Argument focus. Most often the focal nominal or NP is clause-initial and the verb (or
the finite auxiliary of a verb in a compound tense) follows immediately after it. The
postverbal elements then follow in their usual order (subject, indirect object, direct object),
followed by the nonfinite part of a compound tense. The appearance of the verb in the
position after this nominal is unlike any other word-order process in Ingush in that it is just
the conjugated verb form – the finite auxiliary of a verb in a compound tense, or the shorn
stem of a prefixed verb – that is moved; the rest (the prefixes, the nonfinite part of an analytic30. Word order687tense form) remains at the end of the sentence. Enclitics that can attach only to the verb,
however, stay with the conjugated form. A parenthetical word is discounted in figuring
second position.
In the following examples the second-position finite verb form is boldface. (104)-(105)

"242Ingush GrammarCHAPTER 13
INFLECTIONAL CATEGORIES OF THE VERB
13.0. Introduction
Ingush has a large number of tenses and moods which combine with aktionsart and
pluractionality categories (Chapter 14) to create a very rich system of tense-aspect-mood
distinctions. This chapter describes the forms and meanings of the TAM categories.
Appendix 1 includes full inflectional tables for two simplex verbs. Tables 12-1 and 12-2 in
Chapter 12 show the main forms for one verb of each conjugation class.
Ingush has tenses that I have labeled narrative past and narrative pluperfect because they
are used primarily in narrative. Speakers also use a narrative present discourse strategy,
which involves shifting some tenses to present and some simulfactives to pluractional. Since
this is a discourse strategy for the use of tenses rather than a distinct tense or set of tenses, it is
described in Chapter 33 on discourse (§33. 4).
Ingush is notably sensitive to evidentiality, and speakers generally comment on the
evidentiality rather than on the aspect or tense when asked to explain the meaning of a tense.
I have tried to label tenses based on the most salient meanings, so the tense that might have
been called aorist is termed witnessed past here and what might have been called perfect is
termed nonwitnessed.
13.0.1. Overview of TAM formation. Recall from Chapter 12 that regular verbs mostly have
the root shape CVC and several irregular ones have the shape CV; and that there are three
stem forms, marked by different ablaut grades in regular verbs: present, past, and infinitive.
To these stems are added various tense/mood endings. (Morphophonemics are explained
below with the individual tenses and moods.) The forms with their endings are shown in (1).
(1) Endings, classified by stem type. The productive form is listed first.

in -n, -d, some in -l and -t
(and -ln- > -nn-, yielding -nna) for most stems in
-l and all in vowel (most of which are irregular)-ieThere are also a good number of tense/aspect/mood auxiliaries, chiefly forms of the verbs 'be',
which are postposed to one or another suffixed form (most often a converb). The auxiliaries
take the full range of tense forms and may themselves be complex with further auxiliaries. It
seems that all possible combinations of base forms, auxiliaries, and tenses of auxiliaries
occur, and the meanings of the combinations are partly but not entirely predictable from the
sum of the parts. Here I have described only those that occur with sufficient frequency in the
Berkeley Ingush Corpus to support descriptions in standard terms.
For practical purposes the tenses can be divided into suffixed ones and those formed with
auxiliaries. Some of the tense suffixes have distinctive morphophophonemics that point to an
origin in clitics, and some are etymologically identical to independent verb forms and must
once have been auxiliaries, but they are all suffixes at this point. The auxiliaries are written
as separate words in Ingush spelling, and they are separate syntactic words: they can be
moved by word-order rules, can stand alone as answers to questions, etc., and some of them
can determine the case of the subject, overriding the lexical verb's case assignment.
13.0.2. Idiosyncratic tenses. There are two verbs 'be': neutral d.y (an irregular verb) and
delimited xul (regular). Their forms were shown in Table 12-3. Both verbs function as
lexical verbs and also provide TAM auxiliaries. Neutral 'be' has a defective stem paradigm
with only a present stem and the forms based on it. It has a plain past tense, which no other
verb has; all other verbs have imperfect, witnessed past, and others which neutral 'be' lacks. It
also has a synthetic negative simultaneous converb d.oacazh and a synthetic negative
interrogative d.iec=ii. All other verbs have analytic forms here.
13.0.3. Interlinears. Some of the tense and mood forms would require very long interlinears
if the interlinears were fully explicit. Compare the two interlinears of the same form (irrealis
converb of the negative pluperfect) in (2): the first one completely interlinearizes both the
lexical stem b.eaxaa- (an anterior converb) and the tense auxiliary b.iec- (a form of 'be'); the13. Verb inflectional categories245second leaves out some of the information about two pieces and is both shorter and more
informative about tense because it labels the tense as a whole.
(2) a. beaxaa-biecarie
B.live.CVant-B.be:NEG.PST.CVirr
if (they) hadn't lived (0415.12)b. beaxaa-biecarie
B.live-B.NEG.NW.CVirrFor several of the inferential and progressive tenses (§§13.3, 13.4), if the interlinear shows the
full analysis of the auxiliary or each component of the auxiliary, the TAM category of the
whole form is not indicated anywhere. If there is not a separate interlinear for each
component, then at least when the components are written as separate words (as when
separated by interposed clitics, or when so spelled in the orthography) it is not clear what
those pieces mean. For these reasons I have generally interlinearized the last element of the
auxiliary with no lexical gloss but just the name of the entire category, e.g.:
(3) pwa hwearchaa
xannab
feud enmesh.CVant NARP.B (narrative past, B gender agreeing with pwa)
he had gotten involved in a vendetta
(4) vaxaa
xannaxugvy
V.go.CVant INFRnw.V
(nonwitnessed inferential tense)
(he) must have gone (there) (taken from (82) below)
or, more explicitly:
(5) vaxaa
xanna
xugvy
V.go.CVant be.CVant INFRnw.V
(he) must have gone (there)(nonwitnessed inferential tense)Where these same forms serve as main verbs they have lexical interlinears and glosses:
(6) xannab
be.NW.B
(they) were; (they) became
(7) xugvy
be.FUT.V
(he) will be246Ingush Grammar13.1. Simple (synthetic) tenses
Simple, or synthetic, tenses consist of the verb stem and the ending. The ending can
include a cliticized form of 'be' (as the future and nonwitnessed endings do), but the whole is
a single phonological and syntactic word. In contrast, the analytic tenses have an auxiliary
which is a separate phonological word and (except for the inferential tenses) a separate
syntactic word (it can assign case to the verb's subject, overriding the case lexically governed
by the verb but making no changes in argument structure and having no effect on the object
case).
13.1.1. Present tense. Form: Present stem plus present ending. For most verbs (and all
but two regular verbs), the present tense suffix is zero. Since the root-final consonant is then
in word-final position, final gemination occurs (§3.3.1).
Meaning: This is more properly a generic present tense, having much the same force as
the English simple present: 'reads', 'calls', etc.

13.3.5. Inferential perfect. Anterior converb plus the future tense of delimited 'be'. The
meaning is that the speaker infers (not from evidence but logically) that the event must have
happened. In (78) the interviewer knows that the person in question was shown on television
and confirms the speaker's statement. This tense is often used in the consequence clause of a
conditional construction. Note that in form it looks like a future perfect ('will have gone',
etc.), but it never seems to have such a meaning.

This grammar is partly based on work supported by NSF SBR 9222294 and 9616448. Field
work from 1979 to 1989 was carried out in Tbilisi and Ingushetia as a participant in
exchanges of junior and senior faculty supported by the International Research and
Exchanges Board (IREX). In Tbilisi I was affiliated with the Oriental Institute of the
Georgian Academy of Sciences, and I thank the Institute staff and especially Tamaz
Gamkrelidze, then its director, for research facilities, scholarly hospitality, and a stimulating
and uncowed intellectual environment. In Moscow during those years I was fortunate to
enjoy the collegiality of Sasha Kibrik and Sandro Kodzasov and benefit from their immense
knowledge of Nakh-Daghestanian languages, fieldwork, and typology.
Additional work has been supported by the Committee on Research and the Institute for
Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies of the University of California, Berkeley;
ISEEES has also provided administrative and other support for the project. The Department
of Slavic Languages and Literatures and the Department of Linguistics of the University of
California, Berkeley have provided administrative support of all kinds and have made it
possible to offer courses on the Ingush language, field methods using Ingush, and languages
and peoples of the Caucasus. Questions from students in these courses have alerted me to
aspects of Ingush grammar and its theoretical implications that I would not otherwise have
noticed, and some of their research projects have turned into important publications on Ingush
(Conathan & Good 2000, Handel 2003, Peterson 2001, Sprouse 1997).
Ronald Sprouse of the Linguistics Department, UC Berkeley has been technical director
for this project and the related dictionary and text projects, and without his expertise and the
electronic resources he has created no adequate grammar could have been written. In
particular, the Berkeley Interlinear Text Collector (Sprouse 1997) has made it possible to
gather, annotate, and search a sizable text corpus and thereby to find examples and identify
and track grammatical phenomena – which would otherwise have taken years.
As described in Data Sources above, David A. Peterson, Ronald L. Sprouse, Heather
Rose Jones, Lisa Conathan, Jonathan Segal, and Nancy Urban (all as graduate students at the
University of California, Berkeley) and Zarina Molochieva (as graduate student at the
University of Leipzig) elicited and transcribed some of the material in the Berkeley Ingush
Corpus. Reiko Kataoka and Alysoun Quinby (as undergraduate students at Berkeley)
digitized many hours of analog recording; Alysoun helped devise metadata standards and
Reiko (then a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley) did more
digitization, prepared the spectrograms used here, and provided expert advice on their design.
Peter Fröhlich of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig also
digitized and converted much audio material and gave expert advice on many questions of
technology.
I have been fortunate to be able to carry out field work, grammatical analysis, and text
work since 2002 in the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, and I
thank the director of the Linguistics Department, Bernard Comrie; the administrative andxviitechnical staff and in particular Julia Cissewski, Peter Fröhlich, and Claudia Büchel; and the
linguistic scholars who have worked there for collegiality, administrative and technical
support, and a superb physical and intellectual environment, without which this grammar
would not have been possible in anything like its present degree of completeness.
I am deeply grateful to Mariam Yandieva of the Ingush Permanent Representation in
Moscow for arranging scholarly contacts, facilitating travel of colleagues from Ingushetia to
Germany, and generously providing all manner of administrative, organizational,
bibliographical, and intellectual support for my work on Ingush over the last decade, and for
helping forward recent Ingush scholarly publications I would not otherwise have had access
to. Her efforts and those of many colleagues in Ingushetia have made it possible to build up
collections of works in and on Ingush in the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology, Leipzig and the University of California, Berkeley. Sultan Mereshkov and
Lilia Tarieva have organized and facilitated much of the collection of this and other literature.
I thank Mustafa Bekov and his family for organizational assistance, local hospitality,
advice, and linguistic consultation for my work in Germany and for the larger Ingush text
collection, and for a taste of Ingush cultural and intellectual life.
An anonymous reviewer made extremely useful and detailed comments on the
manuscript, especially concerning phonology and morphology. Matthew Dryer and Alice
Harris made extensive and very helpful comments on two of the syntax chapters. All of this
assistance is gratefully acknowledged.
Impetus for this grammar and the dictionary it draws on (Nichols 2004) came from a
graduate field methods course taught at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1995-1996.
I am grateful to the students in the course (some of whose work is referenced here); to Issa
Guliev, who served as consultant in the course and whose participation in the analysis, data
collection, and presentation went well beyond the usual consultant's role and who motivated
us to start work on the dictionary without which this grammar could not have been written;
and above all to Larry Hyman, then chair of Berkeley's Linguistics Department, whose idea
the course was and who contributed advice, resources, and boundless enthusiasm. I thank
Larry as well as Paula Floro and Belen Flores for administrative support of the course.
Above all I am grateful to the many speakers of Ingush I have worked with over the
years, especially to Issa Guliev and Sultan Mereshkov, excellent and patient speakers of
Ingush and perceptive analysts of their language, who have provided most of the text
translations and elicited examples used here and whose insights have made it possible to
detect and then analyze most of the typologically interesting properties of Ingush. I hope that
the extent of their contribution will speak for itself in the quality of the examples and
commentary that their intuitions have made possible.
I am also grateful to my students and colleagues and other scholars in the field of Slavic
linguistics. There is little direct connection between Slavic linguistics and Ingush studies,
though the Caucasus is part of Soviet and post-Soviet area studies, much literature on Ingush
is in Russian, Ingush has interacted with Russian and is undergoing shift to Russian, and
Russian serves as my main contact language with Ingush speakers and scholars; but years ofxviiiteaching and working on a ""big"" language and in a tradition that enjoys extensive knowledge
about the structure and history of its languages have given me a different sense of what needs
to go into a grammar than I would otherwise have had.
I am responsible for all analysis and interpretations, linguistic or other, offered here.
Since in the course of linguistic work on grammar and vocabulary I have observed that my
Ingush colleagues generally do not consider the language endangered and do not share my
typological background, I will emphasize explicitly that in thanking the many Ingush
speakers I have worked with I do not imply that they necessarily endorse any of my views.","[20, 21, 22, 23]"

8.3.10. Nominalization of genitives and other obliques. Genitive case forms of nouns and
pronouns, ablatives, and various adverbial forms can add nominalizing morphology with the
semi-periphrastic declension (§§11.6, 11.7), in which the nominative adds the nominalized
form of 'be' and the oblique cases take the extension -chu-. The process appears to be fully
productive for genitives. The word is a headless relative and the meaning is generally
possessive, with an anaphoric or generic possessum. (For more pronoun forms see §9.1.3.)
The following examples are from sy 'my' and the genitives of 'brother', 'Musa', and 'someone
else'.","[183, 184]"
