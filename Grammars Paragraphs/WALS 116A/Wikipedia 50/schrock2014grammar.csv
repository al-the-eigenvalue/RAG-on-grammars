"Just like thatǃFinally, Ik has both positive and negative independent polarity particles:
ee/éé ‘yes’ and ńtóodó ‘no’. The particle ńtóodó seems to be morphologically
complex, though it cannot be fully parsed out. In any case, it seems to
incorporate the negator verb ńt-. In Ik, contrary to English, a negative reply
to a negative question can be preceded by ee/éé ‘yes’, and positive reply to a
negative question can be preceded by ńtóodó ‘no’. Consider the following:
(256)Negative question:Nta beɗidi?
ńt-ábɛ́ɗ-ɪ ́dɪINTERROG
̀not-REALwant-2SG [IRR]Don’t you want (it)?
(257)Possible answers:
Ee, nta beɗi.",[589]
"9.12.3 Alternative questions
So-called ‘alternative questions’ (Dixon 2012:398-400) are made possible in
Ik through the use of the disjunctive conjunction keɗe ‘or’. This conjunction
joins noun phrases in a series or whole clauses into a complex sentence.
Apart from keɗe, Ik alternative questions are not marked by any overt
morphological or prosodic means. In the examples below, keɗe joins two534clauses that could each constitute polar questions on their own. Together
they make up a content question whose answer will be the affirmation of
one or the other. Note that the final constituent remains in its final form:
(189)Maraŋa keɗe gaan?
[maráŋ-á] keɗe[ɡaan-∅]good-REAL orbad-REALIs it good or (is it) bad?
(190)Giriana keɗe dzigwiiƙotan?
[ɡir-í-án-a]keɗekeep-PLUR-IPS-REAL or[dzíɡw-i-iƙót-an-∅]
sell-PLUR-AND-IPS-REALWere they regularly kept or regularly sold?","[565, 566]"
"5269.12 Questions
Questions in Ik may be polar (yes/no) questions or content questions. Polar
questions add an interrogative overlay to a sentence otherwise in the
indicative mood. This overlay consists of a) the non-final form of the final
morpheme in the clause and b) an interrogative intonation. Content
questions, on the other hand, involve a) interrogative words that substitute
for the clausal constituent they question, and optionally b) a topicalized
structure where the interrogative word acts as a verbless clause (copula)
complement. Each type of Ik question is described in more detail below.","[557, 558]"
"9.12.1 Polar questions
Polar questions generally expect a simple confirmation or denial as a
response. The response can be ‘yes’ (éé/ee) or ‘no’ (ńtóodó) or a repetition of
the question in the affirmative. Such questions in Ik are recognized by two
characteristics: 1) They end with the non-final allomorph of the last
morpheme in the question (as opposed to the final form in an Indicative
sentence), and 2) the last mora of the question takes a low boundary tone:
(166)Maraŋa?
maráŋ-à(167)Maraŋǃ
  maráŋ-∅ good-REALgood-REALIs it good?",[558]
"In answer to this question, one typically responds with another question:
(90)(Iyida) bia ʝii?
(i-íd-a)bi-a=ʝɪɪbe-2SG-REAL you.SG.NOM=also
(Are you there) you also?
The standard greetings in (89)-(90) mirror exactly those in Teso-Turkana
languages where the phrase is rendered Iyai a? ‘Are you (sg.) there?’ or
Iyakasi a? ‘Are you (pl.) there?’ A variation on this greeting in the northern
Dodoth dialect of Karimojong is set in the subsecutive mood as
Toyai/Toyakas ‘And you be there’ which can also have imperative overtones,
as in ‘You be there’. The grammatical form of these greetings has seeped
into Ik as Iyiduk/Iyituk ‘(And) you be there’ in the sequential aspect, though
this form is less frequently heard. This reflects the fact that most Ik
greetings are grammatical replications of those found in Teso-Turkana.",[497]
"127[ƙaátanaamuɲ]In (80), apart from the third person plural subject suffix {-át(i)-}, all the
morphemes in this sentence have low tones. So here the indicative tune
surfaces as a gradual declination of low tones ending on muɲ ‘all’.
The interrogative tune is the intonational pattern used for yes/no questions.
This tune is defined by a low boundary tone that replaces any high tone on
the final syllable. As a morpho-syntactic correlate of this tune, the final
morpheme of the sentence must occur in its non-final form. This
morphological open-endedness can be viewed as iconic of the fact that a
question is pragmatically open-ended, expecting a response.
(81)Jʼeʝa naa awee?
ʝɛʝ-a=náaꜜawé-estay-REAL=PST1home-DATDid s/he stay at home?(**awé-é)128[ʝɛʝanáaawée]The final form of ‘at home’ is awákᵉ, as seen above in (81), while the usual
non-final form is awéé. However, in questions with the interrogative tune,
the low boundary tone replaces the high tone on the dative case suffix {-ɛ}.
On words like muɲ ‘all’ that already have a low tone, the interrogative
tune’s low boundary tone leads to an extra-low decline at the end:
(82)Ƙaata naa muɲu?
ƙa-át-a=naamuɲugo-3PL-REAL=PST 1 all
Did they all go?","[158, 159, 160]"
"The confirmational construction is morphologically interrogative, in that the
final vowel is voiced in a clause-final position. For example, in the
indicative mood, one would expect the phrase in (305) ‘Yes, I did speak (to
so-and-so)’ to surface as noo tódi in Ik, with the realis {-a} devoiced or
deleted. Perhaps at a pragmatic level, the structure is functioning as a
rhetorical question whose implied response is ‘Yes, of course you spoke’.",[458]
"9.12.2 Content questions
Content questions in Ik involve clauses in which a constituent has been
replaced with an interrogative word. Unlike in some languages, only one
interrogative word per question is permitted in Ik. Ik Interrogative words—
see (179) below—include those corresponding to (and therefore standing in
place of) (pro)nouns, adverbs, and verbs. Besides the interrogative words
themselves, no other special morphological or intonational means are used.",[561]
"When a particular clausal constituent is questioned rather than the whole
clause, it is fronted into a cleft construction. In this construction, the
focused element acts as a verbless clause complement and takes the
copulative case. The rest of the clause then shifts into a subordinate clause
structure. This syntax of this construction is the same as is used for content
questions. The following examples compare non-focused polar questions
(175 and 176) with their respective clefted equivalents (177 and 178):
(175)Atsia naa kaudzoe?
ats-íd-a=naakaúdzo-è INTERROGcome-2SG -REAL=PST1money-DATDid you come for money?",[560]
"Besides the interrogative low boundary tone evident in (166) and (67), one
may detect a slightly higher overall pitch level for the polar question. This
higher pitch level does not affect tone at the lexical or phrase level but527merely raises the relative pitch of the whole sentence. The degree to which
the pitch is raised seems to be tied to the level of emphasis or emotion
behind the question. For more on the intonational tunes of indicative,
interrogative, and ‘solicitive’ sentences, refer back to §3.3.5.
Some further examples of Ik polar questions include these below. For each
clause-final element, its final form is shown in square brackets to indicate
how it would look if the clause were indicative instead of interrogative:
(168)Maa noo tsitsiiƙoti ʝotea?
má-á=nootsits-í-íƙot-iʝɔtɛ́-âINTERROGnot-REAL=PST 3 roll-PLUR-AND -3SG[ʝɔtɛ́-kᵃ]sisal.root-ACCDid he not used to roll sisal roots?
(169)Zeƙwida koto eɗa?
zɛƙw-ɪ ́d-a=kotoɛɗâ INTERROG[ɛɗá]live-2SG-REAL=then only
So then do you live alone?
(170)Rebana nƙaƙo ʝii?
réb-an-aŋƙáƙ-óʝɪɪ ̀INTERROGwithheld-IPS-REALfood-INSalso[ʝɪkᵋ]Is food also withheld (from him)?
(171)Bona ɲeryaŋa njinia?
bon-aɲéryaŋ-aɲjíní-â INTERROGcare.for-REALgovernment-NOMwe.INC.-ACC[ɲjíní-kᵃ]Does the government care for us?
In principle, any word, phrase, clause, or sentence in the language can be
questioned in a way that expects a confirmation or denial. Whatever
grammatical category the questioned element belongs to, it will be in its
non-final form together with the low boundary tone of interrogative528intonation. In (172) and (173), it is a simple NP that has been questioned,
whereas in (174), a simultaneous subordinate clause is under query:
(172)(173)Ntsa?","[558, 559, 560]"
"529(176)Kaudzoo naa atsidee?
kaúdzo-o=náaats-íd-e=èmoney-COP=PST 1come-2SG-REAL=DP INTERROGWas it money you came for?
(177)Enita bee boroka?
en-ít-á=beeborok-à INTERROGsee-2PL-REAL=PST2 bushpig-NOM

(178)Borokuo bee enita?
boroku-ó=beeen-ít-à INTERROGbushpig-COP=PST 2 see-2PL-REAL
Was it a bushpig that you saw (yesterday)?
The true morphological marker of polar questions in Ik is the final, low
boundary-tone comprising the interrogative intonational tune. In this, Ik
differs from neighboring Teso-Turkana languages like Turkana which
append the invariable question particle -à to utterances to make a polar
question (Dimmendaal 1983:429). Heine & König posited -a as an
interrogative particle in Ik too (1996:116), but this must be based on an
incorrect analysis of the suffix {-a} which marks both nominative case and
realis modality. If either of these morphemes came clause-finally in a polar
question, it would definitely resemble the Teso-Turkana question particle.","[560, 561]"
"9.12.4 Tags
Ever given to rhetorical flourishes, Ik speakers may use one of several
interrogative ‘tags’ to solicit a response from those listening to their speech.
Each of the tags is a negated polar question to which the expected response
is in the affirmative. The following two are representative:
(191)Benia ntia?
beni-a(192)Nti.
ńtíâINTERROGńtínot.be-REAL like.thatlike.thatIs it not so?",[566]
"After one’s origin or destination has been revealed, further seemingly (to
outsiders) intrusive questions may be asked. These questions are generally
good-natured and should be viewed as such. Consider the following:
(102)Isio naa nƙaneid?
isi-o=náaŋƙan-é-íd-∅what-COP=PST 1get-VEN-2SG-REALWhat did you get (i.e. when you went there)?
(103)Nƙaƙa isi?
nƙáƙ-áisi-∅eating- NOM what-GEN
To eat what (i.e. why are you going)?
After greetings, questions, and conversation, leave-taking occurs. When one
participant gets ready to leave, the other may offer such phrases as:470(104)(105)Ƙae ʝaa?Ƙoyuo kotoo?ƙa-e=ʝáaáƙóy-úo =kotoógo-IMP.SG=ADVgo-IMP.PL=ADVAlright, goǃYou go thenǃItae maraŋidikǃ
ɪta-ɛmaráŋ-ídi-kᵉreach-IMP.SGgood-2SG-SIMLReach wellǃ
(106)Epuƙotuo maraŋitikǃ
ep-uƙot-úómaráŋ-íti-kᵉsleep-COMP-IMP.PLgood-2PL-SIMLSleep wellǃ
At any point of a social interaction, the liberal usage of maráŋ ‘good/okay’ is
typically appropriate. And if one is particularly happy about what has
transpired during the interaction, it is suitable to add the following:
(107)Ilakasuƙotiaakǃ
ɪlák-ás-ʊƙɔt-ɪ ́-a-kᵃ
happy- ABST-COMP-1SG -REAL-PRF
Thank you (lit. ‘I have become happy’)ǃ(108)Ilakasuƙotimakǃ
ɪlák-ás-ʊƙɔt-ɪ ́m-á-kᵃ
happy- ABST-COMP-1PL.EXC-REAL-PRF
Thank you (lit. ‘We have become happy’)ǃ9 Phrases and Clauses
Now that phonemes and morphemes (words and affixes) have been
described, the present chapter takes up the topic of basic syntax. It begins
with a discussion of noun phrases (§9.1), followed by simple main clauses
(§9.3-§9.6), a variety of subordinate clauses (§9.7-§9.9), and several other
noteworthy syntactic constructions (§9.10-§9.16). In many regards, this
chapter only scratches the surface of Ik syntax, but it is hoped that the
topics covered here will provide impetus for further investigation.","[501, 502, 503]"
"467Of course, like greeting questions in any language, the ones in (94) are more
like rhetorical questions than information questions. There is handful of
standard replies that may be alternated according to the weather, the
relative hunger felt in that land, or the current mood in the neighborhood:
(95)Biraa emuta iy.
bɪra-aémut-anot.be-REAL story/news- NOMi-∅
be-REALThere is no news.
(96)Ɲeƙe eɗa.
ɲɛƙ-aɛɗáhunger- NOMonlyOnly hunger.
(97)Maraŋa zukǃ
maráŋ-ázukᵘgood-REAL very
Very good.
Chronic hunger, especially in the second and third quarters of the year, has
been part of the Ik people’s normal existence. Over time, the conditions of
hunger have shaped the culture, and this is reflected in another series of
greetings. The following greetings, having to do with hunger and food, are
often quite startling to newcomers in the area. This is because they sound
very direct and are interpreted literally as requests for food, when more
often the people saying them do not actually expect food to be given:
(98)Isio nƙan?","[498, 499]"
"469Another component of Ik greeting is asking about one’s movements to and
fro. In Western society, this may seem rude as most people live out their
individual lives with a good deal of privacy. But in tight-knit communities
like those of the Ik, ones that have suffered from attacks and emergencies of
all kinds, knowing each other’s whereabouts is an expected nicety. The
following questions and replies are respresentative of what one might hear:
(100)Atsida ndee?","[500, 501]"
"After these initial greetings used to initiate a social interaction, any of the
following questions may be posed in a polite bid for more information:
(94)Kutana is?",[498]

"30In late 2009, we finally were able to move to Ikland, to a compound with an
Ik village less than 100 meters away. Although still living in a private
compound, our contact with Ik speakers increased significantly. During the
first two months, SIL lexicographer Ron Moe and I conducted a lexicography
workshop involving fifteen Ik men and women. Many of the words in
Appendix B were collected during that workshop. And since we lived there,
language learning and text collection increased from that point on.
For much of 2010, Longoli Philip became a regular language informant,
working with me on various aspects of the language development program.
Longoli completed Form Two of secondary school but has had opportunity
for many types of training over the years, including in linguistics. He had
worked previously with Bernd Heine, Fritz Serzisko, and Richard Hoffman.
In late 2010, Longoli Philip and I took part in a tone workshop led by SIL
tone specialist Keith Snider. Philip was the only Ik speaker in Nairobi at that
time. For six weeks we elicited and analyzed tone data together.
For the next year and a half (2011-2012), Longoli Philip continued to work
with me as my main teacher of Ik. American linguist Kate Shugart visited in
late 2011, and along with Amber Schrock collected numerous oral histories
that were later transcribed by Longoli Philip. In January 2012, two other
men, Komboni Daniel and Lokwameri Sylvester, began interacting with us
and providing more data through a translation training course we held.
Finally, after six months away from the Ik area, we returned to Ikland to
intermittently fill in gaps in the data, revise hypotheses, and finish writing
during the whole year of 2013. From the end of 2013 through the early part
of 2014, Lomeri John Mark—at last returned to Ikland—provided crucial
last-minute help in answering grammatical questions, checking examples,
and filling in paradigms. In March-April of 2014, a group of ten Ik men
participated with me in an orthography workshop. More data and insights
came from our enjoyable interaction. Research then concluded in July 2014.","[61, 62]"
"27As the years progressed, other linguists undertook to describe Ik. This led to
several early grammar sketches, each with different emphases, including
Crazzolara 1967, Heine 1971, Tucker 1971-73, and Heine 1975. Once Ik
became known to the linguistic world, the question of Kuliak internal and
external classification arose. This question was first addressed by Greenberg
1963, then Heine 1976, and in the same year Bender 1976, followed later
by contributions from Ehret 1981, Fleming 1983, and Lamberti 1988.
The first attempt at a full grammar of Ik was Heine 1983, which
unfortunately was never published. From there, the mantle of Ik grammar
study was taken up by Fritz Serzisko, a colleague of Heine’s at Cologne.
Serzisko published a series of books and articles on Ik and on various
linguistic topics with Ik as the main source of data (Serzisko 1985, 1985-87,
1987, 1988, 1989a-b, 1992, and 1993a-b). Heine 1990 also appears, a study
of the dative case in Ik and Kanuri. Later in the decade comes Heine &
König 1996, an unpublished revision and expansion of Heine 1983.
In the 1980s and ‘90s, formerly SIL linguist Richard Hoffman began working
on the language. Although he never published on it, he gained a thorough
knowledge of Ik grammar and began working out a practical orthography.
Also in the 1990s, Heine returned to Ik and published the first Ik-English
dictionary (1999) that included an ethnographic sketch, phonology sketch,
and an ethnobotanical section. The new millennium began with König's
lengthy exposition of Ik case (2002) and SIL’s sociolinguistic survey of the Ik
area (2007). König 2008 refined her 2002 analysis of Ik case and fit it into a
broader and much-needed discussion of case across Africa.
Since 2008, I have been personally conducting linguistic research on Ik,
under the auspices of SIL Uganda. This research has led to a number of
papers, including a foray into nominal tone (2011a), a phonological sketch
(2011b), and a description of the Ik instrumental case (Schrock 2014).","[58, 59]"

When the question ‘Where?’ is asked in isolation, the interrogative pronoun

"The back vowels /o, ɔ, u, ʊ/ can be desyllabified before an adjacent vowel,
yielded [w] as a semi-vocalic allophone. The front vowels /i, ɪ/ can also be
desyllabified, producing [y] as their semi-vocalic allophone. Whether the
mid front vowels /e, ɛ/ can desyllabify to [y] is an analytical issue touching
on the interpretation of diphthongs (see §2.2.3 below). Dimmendaal 1995
argues that for Nilotic languages, so-called diphthongs should be reanalyzed
as glide+vowel sequences. But Ik diphthong-like units (vowels with two44targets) include combinations of mid and low vowels like [e̯a], making a
[ya] interpretation inappropriate. So if the diphthong analysis is rejected,
the existence of mid-level semi-vowels [ĕ, ɛ̆] must be posited instead.
Using Speech Analyzer software, the following four nouns were compared in
terms of the duration of their vowel targets. The approximate measurements
from a single Ik speaker indicate that the duration of a diphthong-like sound
is longer than for single vowels but shorter than for double vowels:
(14)Vowel length measurements

again below in §2.2.3, where a list of representative words is presented.
All nine Ik vowels are devoiced before a pause as a general rule. This is a
clear example of the phonology-syntax interface: A syntactic boundary
(clause-finally and before a pause) is the conditioning environment for
vowel allophony. Non-voiced vowels are an areal trait; they are found in
various language families around Sub-Saharan Africa, including the local
Teso-Turkana languages and more distant Cushitic languages like Oromo,
Burunge, Alagwa, and K’abeena (Mous 2012:353). Vine gives them the
‘phonetically neutral’ label ‘shadow vowels’ (1981:385), while Novelli calls
them ‘breathed’ (1985:29). ‘Whispered’ is also a term found in the literature.
According to Vine, voiceless vowels are either 1) allophones of underlyingly
voiced vowels, 2) surface realizations of underlyingly voiceless vowels, or 3)
the result of the auto-segmental behavior of largyngeal features (1981:409).
The Ik vowels of this type are called called ‘devoiced’ here to reflect the
analysis that they are underlyingly voiced vowels that have undergone45devoicing. Following a tradition started by Crazzolara 1967, the Ik devoiced
vowels are written with the superscript symbols [ⁱ, ᶦ, ᵉ, ᵋ, ᵃ, ᵓ, ᵒ, ᶷ, ᵘ]. Even
though their occurrence is allophonic, the devoiced vowels are written
throughout this grammar. Perhaps because their conditioning environment
is syntactic as well as phonological, native speakers seem much more aware
of devoiced vowels than other consonantal or vocalic allophones.
In the neighboring languages of Toposa (Schröder & Schröder 1987) and
Turkana (Dimmendaal 1983), non-voiced vowels have been analyzed as
distinct phonemes, contrasting with voiced vowels. Dimmendaal writes that
“With regard to the position of non-voiced vowels, it is noted that they only
occur in word-final position (i.e. potentially in the position before pause),
but so may voiced vowels. It is, therefore, not predictable synchronically in
Turkana when a vowel is [+voiced], or [-voiced]” (1983:31). But in Ik, it is
generally predictable: Any vowel before a pause is devoiced, and any vowel not
before a pause is voiced. For Turkana it is claimed that underlying non-voiced
[-voiced] vowels become voiced “in the position other than before pause”,
as the following examples illustrate (Dimmendaal 1983:31):
(15)lo-muɡi ̥ || → [lomuɡ̥ʰi ̥]‘the mauve-colored one’lo-muɡi ̥ lo → [lomuɡi lo]‘this mauve-colored one’The opposite interpretation is given for Ik: Underlyingly voiced vowels become
devoiced before a pause. Such a view helps explain apparent evidence for
phonemic voicing contrast in examples like the following:
(16)ín-o||→ ínᵒ [i ́no̥]‘with (an) animal(s)’ínó-o||→ ínó [ínó]‘from (an) animal(s)’In (16), the noun root ínó- ‘animal(s)’ takes two case suffixes. In the first
line, the instrumental case suffix {-o}, which first subtracts the root-final
vowel /o/, is devoiced before a pause. In the second line, the ablative case
suffix, also {-o}, which preserves the root-final vowel, gets devoiced and46actually deleted, leaving the root final vowel fully voiced. So what first
appears to be a case of contrastiveness between voiced and non-voiced
vowels is really a syntactically conditioned type of allophony. The
devoiced/deleted vowels in (16), when in a clause-medial position, surface
as fully voiced in line with their underlying voicing specification:
(17)ín-ó=ni→ínó=ni[ínónì]‘with these animals’ínó-o=ni→ínóo=ni[ínóônì]‘from these animals’The examples above in (16) illustrate another trait of Ik devoiced vowels:
Depending on the vowel preceding them, they may be completely inaudible.
As such, a further allophone of all nine vowels is simply zero [∅]. A
devoiced vowel is inaudible when it is identical or very close in quality to
the vowel that immediately precedes it, for example in:
(18)baro-o→baroᵒ[bàrò]‘from the corral’dakú-o→dakúᵒ[dākú]‘from the tree’ɲɛƙɛ-ɛ→ɲɛƙɛᵋ[ɲɛ̀ƙɛ̀]‘of hunger’sɪsɪ ́-ɛ→sɪsɪ ́ᵋ[sɪ ̄sɪ ́]‘in the honey-beer’As noted above, pre-pause vowel devoicing is a general rule. The rule is
supsended in the following four environments: 1) when the phrase or clause
has interrogative intonation, 2) when the phrase or clause has solicitive
intonation, 3) when the anaphoric demonstratives =ꜜdɛ́ɛ ́ (sg.) or =ꜜdíí (pl.)
are present, and 4) when the vowel in question is part of a deictic
demonstrative. In environments (1)-(2), the syntax and therefore the
phonology iconically reflect the pragmatic notion that the clause lacks the
level of finality needed for devoicing. For a question, this entails waiting for
an answer. For solicitation, this entails waiting for the desired response:47(19)Ƙaa naa awak.","[75, 76, 77, 78, 79]"

Lochiyo Gax Gabriel(197?-2011)Lopuwa Paul(198?-2014)Ik friends whose lives were cut short by sicknessForeword
This book contains a grammar of Ik, not the grammar. It is really just a ‘state
of knowledge’ report of one individual non-Ik linguist at one point in
history. Of the many topics covered in the following pages, some are no
doubt incorrectly analyzed, while others could probably have been correctly
analyzed in more than one way. And then, of course, the ways of phrasing
the descriptions of each linguistic entity number to infinity.
Trying to capture the grammar of a living language linearly on paper is a
little like photographing an elusive wild animal. As it darts through the
underbrush, you snap your photo. What the photo captures is true: the
shape and contours of the animal, its color and patterns, its mode of
movement. But as true as the photo may be, it in no way does justice to the
living beast. In the same way, a written grammar can trace the structural
features of a language: its phonemes, morphemes, syntactic structures. But
seen in light of the living language in use, the grammar pales in comparison.
Even after completing this project, all I have to do is walk through the
neighborhood, overhear a conversation, or attend a public function to learn
something totally new about the language. After cataloguing all the
phonemes, morphemes, and many lexemes, I can still hear a string of Ik
speech whose meaning escapes me entirely. I have tried to write a true
description of Ik, but the language in use is much more colorful...and alive.
With this grammar I have also tried to initiate a philological tradition for
Ik—‘philological’ in the etymological sense of ‘love of learning’, yes, but also
in the sense of language study from written sources. From now on, one can
study Ik from books alone, perhaps furthering the inquiry into the
relationships between East African languages and where they came from.
Attending to these questions is attending to the people who speak these
languages, and this is one way we can communicate our love for them too.","[17, 18, 19]"
"9.9.4 Purpose
The notion of purpose is expressed primarily through nominalized verbs
acting as complements (see §9.12.2). However, two other types of
subordinate clause can also convey purpose: 1) one with a sequential verb,
or 2) one introduced by the Teso-Turkana conjunction (í)koteré, which in
this instance means something akin to ‘so that…’. Moreover, these two types
can be combined so that a sequential clause is introduced by (í)koteré.
In the first example below, the verb is marked grammatically only with the
sequential impersonal passive suffix. But semantically, it implies that when
the thing in question becomes a certain way, it is for a certain purpose.
(121)Irese koto nti?
[ir-ese=kótóńtí]PURPOSEbe-SPS=thenhowSo that it’s like how?
In this second example, the conjunction (í)koteré introduces a third person
negative imperative whose expressed purpose is that people do not laugh:511(122)Taa kotere maa roɓa fek.
taa[kóteré má-ároɓ-afek-ᵃ]PURPOSEQUOTso.that not-REALpeople- NOM laugh-REAL(That) so that people don’t laugh.
The last example shows (í)koteré introducing a purposive sequential clause:

"275The claim is that objects that have a more prototypical Patient role are more
likely to be marked differently (e.g. with an accusative case) than those
without it. Since prototypical Patients are [-volitional], and since volition
implies animacy, it is claimed that objects further down the cline toward
inanimacy are more likely to be marked differentially (Dimm. 2010:39).
The concept of prototypical transitivity seems applicable to Ik splitaccusativity, but along slightly different lines. In Ik, volition, instigation,
affectedness, and animacy alone do not determine whether an object will be
marked with the accusative case or nominative case. By contrast, the only
relevant factor is whether the Agent of a transitive clause is present in the
conversation, i.e. is a speech-act participant (3 person). If the Agent
(animate or inanimate) is not speaker or addressee, then the object must
take the accusative case. Thus, taking Ik into account, the feature
[±participant] can be added to Næss’ definition of prototypical transitivity.
An Agent that is not a speech-act participant (3 person) embodies a greater
degree of transitivity because its intention (if animate) or capability (if
inanimate) is inaccessible and therefore not knowable or assessable. This
puts greater semantic ‘distance’ between the Agent and Patient than if the
Agent was a speech-act particpant who could be negotiated with. This, then,
is one further attempt to make sense of Ik’s person-based split-accusativity.
Another question relevant to the Ik accusative case is what semantic roles
the object of a transitive clause can take. This question applies to transitive
objects generally, including those marked in the nominative case. Ik direct
objects encode the expected semantic role of Patient, but they can also
encode Direction and/or Purpose. Three Ik verbs of motion—ats- ‘come’, ƙa‘go’, and ɪtá- ‘reach’—are unusual in that they can behave like transitive
verbs. Similar motion-verb properties have been reported as common in
Cushitic and Omotic languages (Dimmendaal 2003:100). Old Nubian is
reported to have marked Patients and Directions with the suffix -ka, while
the Semitic language Tigrinya uses its accusative prefix ni-/nä- to mark
Patients, Directions, and many other roles (Dimmendaal 2010:41).","[306, 307]"

That the cleft construction involves a subordinate clause is shown by the
case marking of any remaining overt arguments in the original clause. For
example, the subject of the verb bɛ́ɗɪ́m in (153) is in the accusative case, the
case all non-sequential subordinate clause subjects are marked with in Ik:
(153)Mesoo ngwaa beɗim.
mɛsɔ-ɔCC[ŋɡó-ábeer-COPwe.EXC-ACC want-1PL.EXC-REALbɛ́ɗ-ɪ ́m-∅]CSIt’s beer (that) we want.
The question remains, however, whether the subordinate clause in (153) is a
relative clause. In the Kuliak language So, clefted interrogative words are
said to be modified by relative clauses (Carlin 1993:135). But for Ik, a
relative clause interpretation for sentences like the one in (153) is ruled out
on the basis that any tense markers immediately follow the clefted
argument, as in (154). Relative clauses, by contrast, are tensed by the
relative pronouns themselves, as in (155):
(154)Mesoo bee beɗim.

"51The data below illustrate devoicing in consonants and vowels. The first
column of (30) gives the abstract lexical form of the nouns (to show their
final vowels), and the second column shows how the nouns surface
phonetically in the final-form of the oblique case (see §6.3.1):
(30)rébe-→[rêbe̥ ]̥‘finger millet’édi-→[êdi̥ ̥]‘name’seɡa-→[sèɡå ]̥‘Umbrella Thorn’taɓá-→[tāɓḁ ]̥‘rock’moriɗo-→[mòɾi ̀ɗ̥o]̥‘beans’emé-→[ēm̥]‘meat’eŋúnú-→[ēŋúnʷ]‘lastborn’wɛla-→[wɛ̀l ̥]‘opening’baro-→[bàr]̥‘herd’As (30) shows, if the devoiced vowel is a back vowel, it may leave a trace of
labialization on the preceding nasal, as in eŋúnú- ‘lastborn’ → [ēŋúnʷ].
The impact that pre-pause devoicing has on final consonants and vowels
ultimately depends on the particular combination of consonant and vowel.
This is also true for neighboring Toposa (Schröder & Schöder 1987:19) and
Turkana languages (Dimmendaal 1983:32). In Ik, there is a general but
violable tendency for devoiced vowels to become completely inaudible after
fricatives /f, s, z, ʒ/, nasals /n, m, ɲ, ŋ/, and liquids /l, r/. The degree to
which holds true depends on such factors as idiolect, speech rate, and other
yet unknown articulatory or pragmatic factors. If, however, the devoiced
vowel in question is needed for meaning, it is pronounced as whispered
regardless of the preceding consonant. This happens, for example, with the
instrumental case. Compare the following final (pre-pause) forms of nouns
with the nominative suffix {-a} and the instrumental suffix {-ɔ}:52(31)NominativeInstrumentalbíbᵃbíbᵒ‘dove’ɓiɓᵃɓiɓᵒ‘egg’kucᵃkucᵒ‘hyrax den’édᵃédᵒ‘name’ɗiɗᵃɗiɗᵒ‘donkey’kafkafᵓ‘thorn’dzóɡᵃdzóɡᵒPappea capensis tree sp.kíʝᵃkíʝᵒ‘land’cúrúkᵃcúrúkᵒ‘bull’ɗɛrɛ́ƙᵃɗɛrɛ́ƙᵓ‘wasp’ɲólɲólᵒ‘dik-dik’ʝʊmˊʝʊmᵓˊ‘soil’kwanˊkwanᵓˊ‘penis’leweɲleweɲᵒ‘ostrich’cɛŋˊcɛŋᵓˊ‘wood-pecker’kopᵃkopᵓ‘vulture’ɡúrɡúrᵒ‘heart’bosbosᵒ‘ear’botᵃ ˊbotᵒˊ‘load’bakutsᵃˊbakutsᵒˊ‘chest’ƙʊtsʼᵃˊƙʊtsʼᵓˊ‘insect’sɛwᵃsɛwᵓ‘stick’ƙwazƙwazᵒ‘article of clothing’mɪ ́ʒɪʒmɪ ́ʒɪʒᵓHippocratea africana plant sp.","[82, 83, 84]"

Is it not (the one of) ours?
In closing, the question must be asked: Is the Ik ‘copulative’ really a case?
As mentioned above, Cushitic parallels for the Ik copulative case suffix {-kɔ}
are analyzed variously as suffixes, clitics and ‘markers’ more generally. In
strictly morphological terms, the morpheme {-kɔ} certainly patterns like all
the other Ik case suffixes: 1) It has an identical segmental shape as that of
the dative and accusative cases, 2) it undergoes identical morphophonological alternations as the others suffixes, and 3) it fills the same
nominal suffixal position as the other case suffixes. Then in syntactic terms,
it patterns with other cases in that it is required to mark a unique argument
(complement) in a specific clause type: a negative copula of identity clause.
Thus it is analyzed in this grammar as a ‘case’ proper, synchronically.
Nevertheless, the copulative case has some peculiar properties that set it
apart from all the other cases. First, apart from its function in marking a
copular complement, the copulative does not encode grammatical relations
of a noun with a predicate or a noun with another noun in a noun phrase.
When it marks a noun, either in a cleft-construction or in a verbless copula
clause, the noun fills the predicate slot. In that position, the noun with the
copulative suffix can be followed by adverbial and tense-marking enclitics
that otherwise come directly after true verbs. So in this sense, the copulative
has a function more characteristic of a verbal morpheme.
Asdiscussedbelowin§6.4.1,Könighastracedachainofgrammaticalization from an old focus marker (cf. the Cushitic parallels) to
both the copulative suffix in the nominal system and the sequential aspect
marker in the verbal system (2002:349-361). And so it would seem that the
Ik copulative case shows the traits of a transitional form between a nominal
and verbal morpheme. This might help explain its cross-categorial behavior.","[319, 320]"

"295Such theorizing about grammaticalization finds practical application in the
analysis of the subject-agreement pronominal suffixes. The analysis of these
suffixes has been both the stimulus and result of case grammaticalization
hypothesizing. A few comments are made below to illustrate the complexity
of the issue and its relevance to Ik grammaticography:
Ik cross-references subjects by means of bound personal pronominal suffixes
on verbs. These are described elsewhere §5.1.4 and §7.4, but a brief
summary is repeated here: The subject-agreement pronominals mark
grammatical person (1-2-3), number (SG and PL) and clusivity (EXC and INC).
The underlying forms of these suffixes are posited as [-ATR] (except 3PL)
with [+ATR] allomorphs after dominant [+ATR] stems or affixes. The
suffixes’ tones may be altered by the verbal stem and certain verbal suffixes.

automatically discoverable in Ik data. Instead, they came to be analyzed this
way through a rather convoluted process. Analysis of these suffixes has long
been confounded by at least three factors: 1) the non-final versus final form
distinction, 2) the realis suffix which substracts stem-final vowels (§7.6.2),
and 3) the behavior of the sequential and simultaneous aspectual suffixes.
The interaction of these three factors had led to two conflicting analyses:296(183)Ik subject-agreement markers in the literature
With /-a/ asWith /-a/ as part of the‘complemental suffix’pronominal suffixes(Crazzolara 1967:23,(Heine & König 1996,Tucker 1972:184)König 2008:83)1SG-í-á-íá2SG-íd-a-ída3SG-∅-a-a1PL.EXC-ím-á-ímá1PL.INC-ísín-a-ísína2PL-ít-á-ítá3PL-át-a-átaThe data in (183) are presented in their non-final forms since the final forms
further obfuscate things by reducing the suffixes’ final vowel. As argued in
§7.6.2, the position taken in this grammar is that the realis suffix {-a}
subtracts the last vowel of whatever morpheme it attaches to. Since this
vowel subtraction happens to the subject-agreement suffixes as well, then
this means that final vowels have been subtracted from the forms in (184).
That is one point. Parallel to this issue is what happens when verbal
extensions like the simultaneous {-kɛ} are suffixed to the subject-agreement
markers. When this occcurs, an /ɪ,i/ rather than an /a/ surfaces between the
subject-agreement markers and the simultaneous suffix. If the vowel /a/ is
part of the subject-agreement markers, it would be hard to explain what
happens to it in this situation. Heine & König 1996 and König 2002 argue
that the intervening /ɪ,i/ is the optative suffix, but no convincing semantic
reason for this is given. Instead, the view taken here is that the intervening
/ɪ,i/ is in fact part of the subject-agreement morpheme, while the /a/ so
often seen is the realis marker than subtracts the /ɪ,i/ in many contexts.
Below in (184) are given all the subject-agreement suffixes in their non-final
and final forms, in both the non-past tense, realis modality on the one hand,297and the simultaneous aspect on the other. For the sake of illustration,
morpheme-breaks are purposely not inserted between the subject-agreement
markers and the realis suffix {-a/-ᵃ} or the simultaneous suffix {-ɛ/-kᵋ}:

König 2002, where do the subject-agreement markers end in the last two
columns of (184)? In answer to this question, it is concluded here that a)
since the dative case preserves the stem-final vowel in the nominal system,
and b) if the simultaneous suffix is a grammaticalization of the dative case,
then c) it too, by analogy, might preserve the final vowel of the morpheme
to which it attaches. In this case, that morpheme is the subject-agreement
suffixes. So, when the simultaneous suffix in the final column of (184) is
removed, what is left is the subject-agreement suffixes without an
intervening optative marker. The realis forms can then be accounted for by
the realis suffix {-a}, itself a (potential) grammaticalization of the
nominative {-a} that subtracts the subject-agreement suffixes’ final vowel.","[326, 327, 328, 329]"
"Yes, we did eat.",[458]
"4.2NumberGrammatical number is reflected in the Ik nominal system in three ways.
First, the base form of nouns is lexically specified for one of three numeric
values: 1) singular, 2) plural, or 3) general (number neutral). Second, based
on a noun’s lexically specified numeric value, the grammar requires number
agreement on relative pronouns, demonstratives, and subject-agreement on
verbs (except for 3PL in relative clauses). Third, number may be marked on
nouns through a system of singulative and plurative inflectors. In Ik, as in
Turkana (Dimmendaal 1983:223), the selection of some pluratives depends
on the noun’s mora count rather than on semantics or any other factor.
Since the lexically assigned numeric value of a noun cannot necessarily be
guessed on semantic grounds, number agreement provides the needed clues.
For example, in (37) below, the non-past demonstrative clitics {=na} ‘this’
and {=ni} ‘these’ can reveal a number-neutral noun’s numeric value:
(37)Singular:ámá- ‘person’ámá=na‘this person’**ámá=ni‘these persons’153Plural:General:roɓa- ‘people’ínó- ‘animal’roɓa=ni‘these people’**roɓa=na‘this people’ínwá=na‘this animal’ínwá=ni‘these animals’Numeric values like the ones evident in (37) are not always obligatorily
marked in the nominal system. Number is commonly marked inflectionally
with singulatives or pluratives or grammatically with relative pronouns,
demonstratives, and subject-agreement, but it is still optional. For example,
without modifiers of any kind, the object rié- ‘goat’ in (38) has two
interpretations with regard to its grammatical number:
(38)Toŋolata naa riyek.
tɔŋɔ́l-át-a=naarié-kᵃslaughter-3PL-REAL=PST 1goat-ACCa) They slaughtered a goat.
b) They slaughtered goats.
If the noun in question is the subject, its number is marked with subjectagreement suffixes (3SG being null), but this type of marking is defective.
For example, in unmarked main clauses, where the verb comes before the
subject, both 3SG and 3PL overt subjects are marked as 3SG (null) on the
verb. This is true whether grammatical number is encoded generally (39) or
with a plurative suffix (40):
(39)Bwaanuƙotaa inw.
buan-uƙot-á-áínw-ᵃdisappear- COMP[3SG]-REAL-PRFanimal(s)-NOMa) The animal has disappeared.
b) The animals have disappeared.","[184, 185]"
"Yes, I did speak (to so-and-so).",[458]
"Yes, a new home.",[560]
"The answer to both of these greetings, as well as the one presented next in
(93), is the refrain given in (90) above.
From mid-morning until the evening, the greetings in (93) are also heard:

Dit boek omvat een analyse van het Ik (Icé-tód), een Kuliak (Rub)-taal
gesproken door 7500 mensen in noordoost Oeganda. Het levert een zo
volledig mogelijke basisinventaris van de klank/vorm/betekeniseenheden
die samen de grammatica van het Ik vormen. Het boek kan voortborduren
op een solide traditie van vijftig jaar taalbeschrijving. Desalniettemin vult
het een aantal belangrijke gaten op. De noodzaak voor een vollediger
beschrijving is nijpend gezien het feit dat de twee andere leden van de
subgroep, Nyang’ia en So/Tepeth, op het punt van uitsterven staan. Een
tweede doel van deze studie is dan ook een precieze en adequate geschreven
weergave te bieden van het Ik voor het geval, door de krachtige neiging tot
assimilatie aan het Engels en de Teso-Turkana talen uit de Oost-Nilotische
(Nilo-Saharaanse) taalfamilie, ook Ik verloren gaat. Een derde doel van deze
studie is een duidelijker beeld mogelijk te maken hoe Ik gerelateerd is aan
de andere talen in de regio, met name door parallellen voor te stellen voor
de grammaticale morfemen van het Ik.
Hoofdstuk 1 begint met een korte inleiding over het Ik-volk, hun
geschiedenis, de ecologie van hun leefgebied, economie, samenleving,
godsdienst en cultuur. Hierop volgt een inleidend overzicht over de taal van
de Ik, waarbij onderwerpen zoals de controverse rond de genetische
classificatie aan de orde komen, maar die ook een typologische
karakterisering van de taal geeft en onderwerpen als variatie, invloeden
door taalcontact, etnolinguistische vitaliteit en eerdere publicaties over het
Ik behandelt. Het hoofdstuk sluit af met een beschrijving van de
methodologie, het veldwerk, de verzameling van de gegevens en hun
beschikbaarheid, en tenslotte de spelling. Hieruit wordt duidelijk hoe het Ik
dat lange tijd in haar bestaan bedreigd was maar toch kans zag voort te
bestaan door aanpassing zonder zijn eigenheid op te geven.","[731, 732, 733, 734, 735, 736, 737, 738, 739, 740, 741]"
"1.2.1 Classification
Greenberg (1963) is the purportedly the source of the original ‘Kuliak
Hypothesis’ which placed Ik and Nyang’ía into a linguistic cluster based on
observed shared traits (Fleming 1983:426). Heine (1976) elaborated on this
hypothesis with a comparative grammar sketch and internal reconstruction
of the group he called Kuliak consisting of Ik, Nyang’ía, and So/Tepeth.
Since then, the internal linguistic relationship between the Kuliak languages
has never been seriously questioned in the literature (Fleming 1983:426).
But, amazingly, no less than six different external classifications for Kuliak
have been proposed over the last fifty years. These conflicting classifications
and some of the linguists who have supported them are presented below:15(9)Conflicting classifications of Kuliak
 Afroasiatic, ‘Fringe’ Cushitic—Tucker 1967a, 1967b, 1971‒3.
This classification was based on, among other things, supposed
similarities between Ik and Ancient Egyptian personal pronouns.
Ik’s elaborate case system also suggests an Afroasiatic affiliation,
but this could just as likely be from sustained language contact.
 Afroasiatic, East Cushitic—Lamberti 1988. Although Lamberti
never actually claimed that Kuliak is related to Cushitic
genetically, he provides ample lexical and morphological
evidence demonstrating at least a significant and long-term
cultural contact between Kuliak and Cushitic.
 Nilo-Saharan, East Sudanic—Greenberg 1963, Ehret 1981a,
1981b, 1989 (in a modified form), 2001, Fleming 1983, Lewis
2013. Evidence supporting this classification includes a high
percentage of lexical cognates with Eastern Nilotic (and Western
and Southern Nilotic to a lesser degree), as well as shared
morpho-syntactic traits with the larger Nilo-Saharan phylum.
 Nilo-Saharan, ‘Satellite-Core’/independent—Bender 1976b, 1989,
1996, Knighton 2005, Dimmendaal 2011.
 Nilo-Saharan, Northeastern branch—Dimmendaal 2013. This
classification is based on traits shared between Kuliak and NiloSaharan languages, e.g. an accusative case marker *ka/ga,
derivational verbal prefixes, and the causative ɪ-/i- which is
considered a stable diagnostic of Nilo-Saharan.
 Unclassified—Gulliver 1952, Laughlin 1975, Heine 1976, 1999,
König 2002. Due to conflicting or insufficient evidence, these
linguists believe a sure classification cannot yet be made.","[46, 47]"
"302Morphologically, Ik is moderately agglutinative, and this is most fully
evident in verbal inflection, for example in a verb like buɗ-úd-it-és-úƙot ‘to
soften’, which in addition to the root buɗ- contains four verbal suffixes. The
most suffixes ever observed in a single verb stem is five, as in ɡaan-i-áá-ƙotát-a-kᵃ ‘They have become increasingly bad’.
The usual citation form of an Ik verb—heard in response to the question
“How do you say________in Ik?”— is the infinitive which is recognizable from
the intransitive nominalizer {-ɔnɪ-} or the transitive nominalizer {-ɛ́sɪ ́-}:
(1)Verbal citation (isolation) forms
IntransitiveTransitiveɛf-ɔn‘to be sweet ‘ɛf-ɪt-ɛsˊ‘to sweeten’zíz-on‘to be fatzíz-it-és‘to fatten’Just as noun roots cannot occur without a case suffix, bare verb roots also
cannot occur. Even those that may sound like a bare root to a non-Ik
speaker—the 3SG realis and singular imperative—have a minimum of one
suffix that may be devoiced or deleted at the surface level. In the realis
modality, 3SG is zero-marked (-∅) because the realis suffix {-a} subtracts
the 3SG subject-agreement suffix {-ɪ}. Then before a pause, the realis suffix
may be completely inaudible, though still present phonologically. Similarly,
the singular imperative {-ɛˊ} may be rendered inaudible before a pause:

the structure of Ik roots, while §7.2-§7.9 handle the topics of verbal suffixes.
Whenever it is convenient to refer only to a root without suffixes, the root
will be hyphenated, as in ats- ‘come’ or zɪ́k- ‘tie’. Such forms are considered
lexical and slightly abstracted from actual speech. This section begins with a
few comments on various features of verbal roots in general.
As a structural possibility, in rare cases lexical roots may exhibit variable
tone melodies with slightly different resulting semantic nuances. Note that
this is not the same as minimal pairs with different meanings altogether, e.g.
dʊ́b- ‘catch’ vs. dʊb- ‘mix with water’. Consider the following examples:
(3)Tonal minimal lexical verb pairs
búd-‘to hide something’bud-‘to hide oneself’hɔ́n-‘to drive animals’hɔn-‘to drive a machine’ŋʊ́-‘to be ground’ŋʊ-‘to grind’The last two verb roots in (3) are illustrated in the two sentences below:
(4)Beɗa ceka ŋweesik.
bɛ́ɗ-ácek-awant-REAL woman-NOMŋʊ-ɛ́sɪ ́-kᵃ
grind-INF -ACCThe woman wants to grind (grain).
(5)Beɗa ŋama ŋweesik.
bɛ́ɗ-áŋám-áwant-REAL sorghum-NOMŋʊ́-ɛ́sɪ-kᵃ
grind-INF -ACCThe sorghum needs grinding.","[333, 334, 335]"
"468The standard reply to both of these questions is bɪra ‘Nothing’. But if
persistent, one may further inquire:
(99)Ayuƙotaa toboŋa?
aĕ-iƙot-á-átɔbɔŋ-aready-COMP-REAL-PRFmaize.mush-NOMHas the posho gotten ready?
One can respond to (99) with sár ‘Not yet’, máá aĕiƙotⁱ ‘It hasn’t got ready’,
or máá naa ŋwɛɛ́sɪ́ᶦ ‘I didn’t grind (flour)’.
Another type of initial greeting, involving the imperative verb bɪ́rɛ́, became
something of a symbol of Ik beggarliness in Colin Turnbull’s (1972)
infamous book about the Ik called The Mountain People. A phrase often
repeated in the book—brinji lotop in his orthography (e.g., p. 56)—is usually
translated as ‘Give me tobacco’. Both in translation and in actual
pronunciation, this phrase sounds abrupt and a bit rude to a foreigner
unaccustomed to a begging/sharing culture. Though the stark intonation of
the phrase is unavoidable, there is a better translation than ‘Give me’.
The imperative bɪ́rɛ́ should not be translated simply as ‘Give me’ because
there is already another verb that means ‘give’: ma-, or me-et- in the
venitive. ‘Give me’ is the correct translation for the phrase meete ɲ́cikᵉ,
where ɲ́ cikᵉ ‘to me’ is the dative case form of the first person singular
pronoun. So ‘Give me tobacco’ would be Meete lɔ́tɔ́ɓa ɲcikᵉ. As discussed
back in §6.3.3, in the phrase brinji lotop—more accurately written as bɪ́rɛ́ ɲ́ ci
lɔ́tɔ́ɓᵓ—the object of the imperative is ɲ́ ci ‘me’ in the oblique case, while lɔ́tɔ́ɓ
‘tobacco’ is an adjunct argument in the instrumental case. If the grammar is
any indication, then the phrase means ‘X me with tobacco’. As best as can be
gathered from its singular use in this greeting of request, the verb bɪ́rɛ́ ɲ́ cⁱ
approximates to something like ‘Help me’, ‘Relieve me’, or ‘Avail me’.","[499, 500]"
"If these differing classifications are any indication, the Kuliak languages
truly are “an enigma in African linguistics” (Carlin 1993:4)16The purpose of this grammar is not to advance another classificatory
hypothesis for Kuliak. But nonetheless, it is hoped that the insights gained
from this study will get the problem closer to its resolution. For a variety of
reasons, there seems to be a bias in the literature toward a Nilo-Saharan
classification for Ik (and Kuliak). The question really has to do with what it
means for a language to be related to another. If, as has been pointed out in
Ehret (1981a) and Fleming (1983), a larger percentage of Ik phonological,
morphological, and lexical traits can be linked to Nilo-Saharan than to
Afroasiatic, is that sufficient evidence for positing a genetic relationship
with Nilo-Saharan? Is the ample counter-evidence linking Ik to Cushitic (e.g.
Lamberti 1988) or Omotic not convincing because of lower percentages?
Without going into great detail, my impression after completing this study
of Ik grammar is that Ik—and Kuliak by extension—should not be
pronounced Afroasiatic or Nilo-Saharan at this time. This statement no
doubt puts me in the camp of ‘splitters’ who resist higher-level
classifications before strongly established sub-groupings (cf. Blench 2010). I
have taken note of the high number of phonological, morphological,
syntactic, and lexical traits tying Ik to Nilo-Saharan, particularly Eastern and
Southern Nilotic. But I have also traced a growing number of morphemes to
both Cushitic and Omotic. Then there remains, of course, a number of
affixes and lexemes for which no areal parallels have been identified.
To summarize, I believe that the Ik language is a yet unclassifiable ancient
language originating somewhere in Ethiopia that has had millennia of
contact with both Afroasiatic and Nilo-Saharan. This sustained contact has
left traces in the form of linguistic ‘genes’ or ‘traits’ shared with both phyla.
In recent centuries, a particularly influential contact with Eastern Nilotic
languages led to a massive influx of vocabulary and calqued grammatical
structures. Like Shabo in Ethiopia, Ik’s linguistic traits straddle at least two
language phyla, and distinguishing contact versus genetic influence will be
extremely difficult. These cross-phyletic resemblances must be exhaustively
identified and catalogued to see what remains of any old Kuliak substrate.","[47, 48]"
"364Sequential verbs are found in both main and subordinate clauses. Main
clauses with the sequential are always subordinate or ‘co-subordinate’
(medial or chained) to a previous controlling clause (see §10.2).
Subordinate clauses with the sequential only come before the main clause
and are used for hypothetical or conditional predications. The sequential
aspect in main clauses is by far the most frequently occurring verb type in
the whole language. It is used in narratives, instructions, explanations,
descriptions, and everyday conversations. The following two sentences
illustrate its narrative (140) and gnomic (141) uses:
(140)Atsini koketini ɦyekesia bi.
ats-inikɔk-ɛ́t-ɪnɪɦyek-esí-ábi-∅come- SEQshut-VEN-SEQlive-INF-ACCyou.SG-GENAnd they come and shut off your livelihood.

kill-COMP-3SG-SEQAnd it tries to bite you with (its) tooth, and it kills (you).
And then the next two sentences illustrate the hypothetical (142) and the
conditional (143) usages of the sequential in subordinate clauses:
(142)Na ƙanaa ɲarema birayoo, maraŋa ƙanak.
na=ƙánaa ɲárɛ́m-abɪra-ɪ-ɔɔ́maráŋ-áCONJ =COND insecurity-NOMnot.be-3SG-SEQ good-REALƙanakᵃ
CONDIf insecurity were not there, it would be good.
(143)Na eniduo ntsaa, kute ntsie ‘Ats’.
na=én-idu-onts-aákʊt-ɛCONJ =see-2SG-SEQshe-NOMsay-IMP.SG she-DATIf you see her, tell her ‘Come’.ntsí-éats-ᵉˊ
come-IMP.SG365The sequential aspect is also used for a series of polite commands,
instructions, or requests. Often the controlling verb (on which the clause
chain is built) is a simple imperative, but it may also be another sequential
verb. In the latter case, a controlling verb is implied:
(144)Ƙae ƙaneiduo cemera egiduo ikak.
ƙa-eƙan-é-idu-ocɛmɛr-aeɡ-idu-ogo-IMP take-VEN-2SG- SEQ herb-NOMiká-kᵉput-2SG-SEQ head-DATGo get medicine and put it on (your) head.
(145)Maxanidoo roɓee awooo?
máxán-ɪdɔ-ɔroɓe-eawó-oógreet-2SG -SEQpeople-DAT home-ABLPlease great people at home, okay?
In addition to the polite imperative usage, the sequential is also used in a
deontic or ‘should/must’ sense. The controlling verb, ɪtámáán- ‘behoove’
may or may not be present:
(146)(Itamaana) atsiduo taa barats.
(ɪtámáán-á)ats-idu-otáabarats-ᵒbehoove-REALcome-2SG -SEQnextmorning-INSYou should come tomorrow (lit: ‘It behooves, (and) you come…’).
Though not reflected in (139), the sequential paradigm also has its own
passive form: {-ɛsɛˊ} (/-eseˊ/ on [+ATR] stems). The sequential passive (SPS)
is impersonal like the non-sequential impersonal passive (§7.9.3); neither
type involve demoting a known agent or promoting the object to subject.
Any inferred agent is vague or impersonal, and they are both normally
translated into English with an agent like ‘people’ or ‘one’ or are left in the
passive. The sequential impersonal passive is discussed more under §7.9.4,
but the next two sentences provide an intial picture of how it works:366(147)Epuƙwes, na baratso ƙeese daŋaaƙok.
ep-úƙó-esᵉná=barats-oƙe-ese dáŋá-aƙɔ-kᵋsleep-COMP-SPSCONJ =morning-INSgo-SPS white.ant-inside-DATPeople sleep and in the morning go for white ants.
(148)Itamaana ogweese ti.
ɪtámáán-áóɡo-esetíbehoove-REALleave-SPSADVIt must be left like that.
A variety of ‘narrative’ or ‘subsecutive’ verb forms are found scattered
throughout the East African region, for example: Lango and Nuer (Western
Nilotic); Toposa, Turkana, Maasai (Eastern Nilotic), and So (Kuliak). As a
result of the long-term contact between Ik and Teso-Turkana languages, one
wonders whether the Ik sequential aspect is a grammatical replication of the
Teso-Turkana ‘subsecutive’ mood. The two have similar functions, but the
morphological resources used for them are quite different. In pursuit of this
question, the following comparison may provide some clues. Data on TesoTurkana are taken from Dimmendaal’s description of Turkana (1983):
(149)Comparison of Ik ‘sequential’ with Teso-Turkana ‘subsecutive’
IkTurkanaAfter a temporal controlling verb?","[395, 396, 397, 398]"
"283Going a step further, when a transitive verb is made into a causative, the
subject (A) of the original verb is treated as an object (O) of the nowcausative verb. But, the object (O) of the original verb is now treated as a
second object or extension (E) in the now causative construction. The data
below shows what happens when the transitive verb wet- ‘drink’, which
requires an agent (A) and a patient (O), is causativized:
(157)Wetuo ima cemerik.
wet-u-oim-aAcɛmɛrɪ-kᵃOdrink-3SG-SEQchild-NOMherb-ACCAnd the child drank the medicine.
(158)Wetituƙotuo imaa cemerik.
wet-it-úƙót-u-oimá-áOcɛmɛrɪ-kᵋEdrink-CAUS- COMP-3SG-SEQchild-ACCherb-DATAnd she made the child take the medicine.
In (157)-(158), the subject (A) of the first clause (im ‘child’) becomes the
patient (O) in the second, now causative clause. And the patient (O) of the
first clause (cɛmɛr ‘herb’) becomes a second or extended object (E) in the
second clause. So in a sense, through a metaphorical extension of the
Location role, the extended object becomes the ‘site’ of the causation.
As a side topic, it is worth mentioning that the Ik verb iryám-ét-oni- ‘to get’
(cf. Teso-Turkana a-ryam-un) always takes an argument in the dative case:
(159)Iryameida bee ŋitsanie?
iryam-é-íd-a=beeŋɪ ́tsanɪ ́-ɛget-VEN-2SG- REAL=PST2 troubles-DAT
Did you get trouble yesterday?
At first glance, it would appear that this is an instance where a core
argument is marked with the dative, a non-core-marking case. However, it284is more likely that despite the English translation of this verb as ‘get’, it is
really an intransitive verb, making the object in fact a peripheral argument.
A clue for this comes from Teso-Turkana, where a-ryam-un ‘to get’ is related
to aki-ryam-un ‘to meet with’. As such, this Ik verb may carry more the idea
of ‘meeting with sth.’ (e.g. ‘acquiring’) as opposed to merely ‘getting’ it.
Finally, on the basis of example (160) below, König has claimed that the
verb form bɪra-e shows a ‘petrified’ form of the dative case on the verb bɪrá‘not there’. She analyzes this verb form as bɪra-DAT and suggests that it has
been lexicalized into a ‘preposition’ meaning ‘without’ (2002:255):
(160)…ɠo-í-akakum-eɛdábɪ ́ra-eíŋar-esí-kᵃgo-1SG-aKakuma-DATalonebe.NEG-DAT help-INF-ACCI went alone to Kakuma without any help.
But this analysis is flawed due to incorrect morphological parsing. The verb
form in question is not bɪra-e analyzed as bɪra-DAT but rather bɪrá-ɪ́-ɛ
analyzed as bɪrá-3SG-SIML. This form is not a noun or verb fossilized into a
preposition but rather an instance of the impersonal, 3SG adverbial
simultaneous verbs used in clause chains (§11.2.2). It is true that this verb
form is often best translated as ‘without’ into English, but it does not follow
that it has become a ‘preposition’. The example sentence in (160), taken
from König (2002:255) is reanalyzed and glossed here as follows:
(161)Ƙoyaa Kakumee eɗa, birayee iŋaaresik.

"Acknowledgments
It is a privilege to acknowledge all the people who helped make the writing
of this grammar possible. I want to thank them here, and if I forget anyone,
please know that it was not intentional. And though many helped me, any
errors left in the book—I fear they are not few—are solely my responsibility.
First, let me acknowledge Wycliffe USA for their administrative support
over the last ten years and SIL Uganda for giving the go-ahead to pursue this
project. SIL’s logistical support was helpful, and I particularly thank our
DirectorandsupervisorDustyHillforhisaccountabilityandencouragement. We also owe a huge debt of gratitude to our personal
‘partners’ in the USA and abroad who have generously funded our ongoing
stay in Ikland. Their financial and spiritual partnership underlies all we do. I
want to honorably mention Richard & Sally Hoffman, friends and
encouragers whose commitment to us and the Ik spurred me on. I also
appreciate their translating a lot of König’s Kasus im Ik into English for me.
Thanks go to Tim Stirtz for introducing me to the external degree offered at
Leiden University and to Constance Kutsch-Lojenga for frequent guidance
through the early stages of the program, particularly in phonological study.
I am grateful to my Promotor Maarten Mous for his patient mentoring and
timely replies to my unending questions. Gerrit Dimmendaal is kindly
thanked for his camaraderie and insightful responses on many linguistic
issues. I appreciate the valuable contribution Ron Moe made in gathering Ik
lexical data, and I thank the following people for their help in tone and
[ATR] analysis: Keith Snider, Rod Casali, Colleen Ahland, Michael Ahland.
The Ik oral histories collected by Amber Schrock and Kate Shugart provided
much grist for the analytical mill—many of the examples in this grammar
come from those texts. Thanks to them for that. I want to also recognizexviSam Beer—my fellow Kuliakist—for stimulating conversations on Ik and
other Kuliak issues. And finally, I want to acknowledge R.M.W. Dixon whose
three-volume Basic Linguistic Theory served as my main textual guide in
writing this grammar. Though not always explicitly mentioned, his
linguistic wisdom undergirds the structure and content of the grammar.
Big thanks are due the Ik people, especially those of the Loɗoi and Lokinene
communities, for sharing their lives and language with us. In one way or
another, most of the knowledge of Ik contained in this book came from
them. Let me recognize a few key individuals. First, I gratefully recall
†Lochiyo Gabriel, †Lopuwa Paul, and Lokwang Hillary for serving as my
initial language guides. Then, Longoli Philip Nayaon is to be acknowledged
for his great contribution through endless hours of transcription, translation,
conversation, and elicitation. Directly and indirectly, the natural giftedness
he has with his mother tongue has left its mark on nearly every page of this
grammar. I owe him a lot. Thirdly, Lomeri John Mark stepped in at the
latter stages of the project to provide me with much needed help in filling in
gaps of knowledge. His amazing natural linguistic awareness helped me put
final touches on many analyses. For that I am grateful.
Several groups of Ik made major contributions to this grammar. These
include the following participants of a 2009 word-collection workshop:
Ariko Hillary, Kunume Cecilia, Lochul Jacob, Lokure Jacob, Longoli Philip,
Losike Peter, Lotuk Vincent, Nakiru Rose, Nangoli Esther, †Ngiriko Fideli,
Ngoya Joseph, Ochen Simon Peter, Sire Hillary, and Teko Gabriel. Another
group comprises translation employees Komboni Daniel and Lokwameri
Sylvester. Thirdly, the following participants in a 2014 orthography
workshop are also thanked for their contributions: Amida Zachary, Dakae
Sipriano, Lokauwa Simon, Lokwameri Sylvester, Lomeri John Mark, Longoli
Philip, Longoli Simon, Lopeyok Simon, †Lopuwa Paul, and Lotuk Paul.","[14, 15, 16]"
"4267.12.3 Confirmational
The tensed conjunctions that are used to introduced temporal subordinate
clauses (§9.6.1) are also used in a ‘confirmational’ construction. This
construction consists of a tensed conjunction (náa, sɪna, or noo) followed by
a verb in the realis modality. Semantically, the construction serves to
confirm a state of affairs by placing extra emphasis on the predication. It
can be translated along the lines of ‘Yes, X did Y.’ Compare the following
regularly tensed sentences and their their confirmational counterparts:
(303)(304)(305)Ƙaa nak.","[457, 458]"
"299Two of these Ik demonstratives have grammaticalized not only into relative
pronouns but also into tense clitics. During that process, the deictic function
a demonstrative has over a single noun or a noun phrase was extended to
whole clauses. Since clauses are singular, the singular forms of the
demonstratives were borrowed to function as tense markers. The tense
markers for recent past and remote past are identical to demonstratives,
while the removed past marker shows a different form of unknown origin:
(187)Ik tense clitics
Non-final formFinal formRecent past=náa=nákᵃRemoved past=bɛɛ=batsᵋRemote past=nɔɔ=nɔkᵓThe discussion above examining the recent past and remote past singular
demonstratives applies equally to the recent and remote past tense enclitics.
For the removed past tense enclitic, the segment /ts/ is missing in the nonfinal form, leading to vowel assimilation. The origin of the suffix /-tsɛ/ is
unknown, though it recalls the Proto-Gumuz word *tsa ‘body’ that has been
grammaticalized in Gumuz for several different uses (Ahland 2012:251).
The parsed versions of the tense clitics in (187) are as follows:
(188)Ik tensed clitics parsed
Non-final formFinal formRecent past=ná-a=ná-kᵃRemoved past=bɛ-ɛ=ba-tsᵋRemote past=nɔ-ɔ=nɔ-kᵓ(188) shows that just as with the demonstratives and relative pronouns, the
frozen suffixes on Ik tense particles lose their consonantal segment in nonfinal forms. The suffix on the recent past closely resembles the accusative300case and present perfect aspect suffixes, and the suffix on the remote past
form closely resembles the copulative case and sequential mood suffixes.
However, just as the present perfect suffix {-ˊka} has a preceding floating
tone, the frozen suffix on the recent past demonstratives and tense clitic
shows evidence of a floating tone. This suggests that the sequences /-ˊka/
for singular and /-ˊki/ for plural are related historically to the present
perfect suffix and not the accusative suffix (which lacks the floating H).
Unlike the grammaticalization links for case>verbal affix discussed above, a
semantic link can easily be envisioned between the present perfect aspecttense marker {-ˊka} as a verbal suffix and the recent past marker {-ˊka} as a
suffix on demonstratives, relative pronouns, and tense enclitics. In the same
way, a semantic link can also be established between the sequential aspect
marker {-kɔ} as verbal sufix and the remote past marker {-kɔ} as a suffix on
demonstratives, relative pronouns, and tense enclitics. This is true for the
singular demonstrative forms; it is less clear how the plural ones developed:

ní-kⁱPST-RECcry-3SG-SEQ
nu-kᵘPST-REMSo based on phonological, morphological, and semantic properties, the
diachronic relationship between the forms in (189) is established. The
question one step removed—whether the present perfect {-ˊka} related to
the accusative case {-ka} and whether the sequential {-kɔ} is related to the
copulative {-kɔ}—is touched on above in §6.4.1 and in Schrock 2013. The
latter source fails to take into account the floating H tone in the present
perfect suffix {-ˊka} which makes a link with the accusative less plausible.","[330, 331, 332]"
"4598.6InterjectionsA number of words may be uttered in Ik that express a speaker’s state of
mind in response to something strongly felt. Such ‘interjections’ are of two
types: 1) Those that have no other meaning and 2) those that do:
(79)(80)Interjections with no other meanings

called ‘ideophones’, forms “characterized by phonological structures that
tend to be peculiar” (Matthews 2007:183). In Ik, this phonological
peculiarity may entail extra-long vowels and multiple reduplications, as well
as expressive tonal and intonational patterns. Ik has three types of
ideophones: 1) Those that are onomatopoeic or symbolic of the sound made
by an action, 2) those that add extra vividness to a stative verb, and 3) those
paired with the verb kʊt- ‘say’ to form special phrasal verbs. Examples of the
first type—onomatopoeic—include the following:
(81)Onomatopoeic ideophones
buluƙsound of stone landing in waterbuúusound of cow lowingdɛrɛdɛrɛdɛrsound of saucepan rollingɗɪsound small sticks make when hitting or breakingɗulsound body makes when hitting the groundfi ̥u̥u̥sound of bullet whizzing byɡuluʝsound made when swallowing a big piece of meathyeaasound of a tree fallingɦyomsound of a stick breaking easilykurukurukursound of a gourd rollingmɛ́ɛɛsound made by goats bleatingpɪssound of sharp object piercing fleshpʊʊtᶷsound of spear going through a bodyraaraarsound of many hands clappingrɪrrrsound of a flametɛsound of firewood breakingtse̥fsound of an animal steppingtudᵘsound made when spear fails to penetratewuoosound of a Euphorbia tree fallingzɪɪɪsound of a vehicle going by461The second type of ideophone—those not obviously onomatopoeic—simply
add some semantic vividness to the verb’s meaning. These ideophones are
often paired with a particular verb, for example:
(82)Non-onomatopoeic ideophones
duuɓoɓa duu‘It’s very deep.’ɗukᵘmasáná ɗukᵘ‘It’s rotten stinky.’heltsáá hel‘It’s very dry.’pakⁱɓetsʼa pakⁱ‘It’s very white.’pice̯od
́ a pic‘It’s very full.’tíkⁱbuɗámá tíkⁱ‘It’s very black.’tsonɗiwa tson‘It’s very red.’The third type of Ik ideophone are those that are paired with the verb kʊt-ɔn
‘to say’ to form special phrasal verbs with highly expressive overtones:
(83)Ideophones paired with kʊt- ‘say’
ɗɪkʊtɔna ɗɪ‘to hit something’ɗɪɪɪkʊtɔna ɗɪɪɪ‘to beat down (of hot sun)’kɪmɪakʊtɔna kɪmɪa‘to be dead silent’lioookʊtɔna liooo‘to be dead silent’lɪ ́ʊʊkʊtɔna lɪ ́ʊʊ‘to make sound of a bullet or beating’ŋɛɗkʊtɔna ŋɛɗ‘to stop suddenly (of one’s heart)’pelkʊtɔna pel‘to make first appearance (of the moon)’pirkʊtɔna pir‘to appear’pɪ ́ʊʊkʊtɔna pɪ ́ʊʊ‘to refuse to catch fire’puaskʊtɔna puas‘to shatter or burst’ritⁱkʊtɔna ritⁱ‘to run and collapse suddenly’tussskʊtɔna tusss‘to ricochet’4628.8Infantile imperativesIk has a collection of short words that are used to encourage young children
to perform certain actions. These ‘baby-talk’ particles are inherently
imperative but involve no verbal morphology. Examples include these:
(84)8.9Infantile imperatives
ɓáused to call a child to come eatbubú‘night-night’, used to encourage a child to go to sleepdɪ ́‘poo-poo’, used to encourage a child to defecatekochildren’s word for ‘water’kɔkɔ́used to warn a child not to touch somethingkukúused to encourage a child to climb on one’s backkwaa‘pee-pee’, used to encourage a child to urinatemamáused to encourage a child to eatnʊʊnʊ́used to encourage a child to nurseTime expressionsTime expressions in Ik do not make up a distinct word class. However, they
do form a special lexical subset worth taking note of. All time expressions
are nouns with case suffixes and other modifiers like demonstratives and
post-posed subordinate clauses. Their being formed from nouns recalls
Turkana adverbs of time which also originate in nouns (Dimmendaal
1983:360). As mentioned back in §6.3.3, the instrumental case is used in Ik
to mark time expressions in the context of sentences. In their isolation
forms, however, the time expressions may take the nominative case.
The names for the weekdays Monday-Friday in Ik are formed with the word
ɲákásií- ‘work’—from Swahili kazi ‘work’—coupled with a numeral
quantifier in a simultaneous clause. For example, the word for ‘Monday’
translates literally as ‘work(day) being one’. The words for ‘Saturday’ and
‘Sunday’ are borrowed from Teso-Turkana. The term of ‘Sunday’ (ɲásaɓéti-)
originates from Italian through the influence of the Catholic church:463(85)Ik days of the week
1Ɲákásíá Kɔnɪkᵋ‘Monday’2Ɲákásíá Leɓetsikᵉ‘Tuesday’3Ɲákásíá Aɗikᵉ‘Wednesday’4Ɲákásíá Tsʼaɡúsíkᵉ‘Thursday’5Ɲákásíá Tudikᵉ‘Friday’6Ɲárámɪram‘Saturday’7Ɲásaɓétᵃ‘Sunday’The names for the months of the year are borrowed from Teso-Turkana
because the Ik have no indigenous alternative. At times the Teso-Turkana
names are translated directly into Ik, but these calques receive little usage.
(86)Ik Months of the Year
1Lomukˊ‘January’2Lokwaŋˊ‘February’3Lɔɗʊ́ŋɛˊ‘March’4Lomarukˊ‘April’5Titímá‘May’6Yɛlɪyɛ́l‘June’7Lɔmɔɗɔkɔɡecˊ‘July’8Lɔsʊ́ɓán‘August’9Lotyakˊ‘September’10Lɔlɔɓáᵋ‘October’11Lopóo‘November’12Loráraˊ‘December’Ik also has time expressions used to refer to days or years removed from the
present either in the past or the future. For the day-terms, Ik combines the
proto-temporal root *tso, the word ódou- ‘day’, or the word baratsó‘morning’ with demonstratives in proclitic and/or enclitic positions. Some of
these demonstratives exhibit phonological reduction, maybe to the point of464lexicalization. Not all the morphology in these terms is fully understood.
The day terms in (87) are presented with Wednesday acting as ‘today’:
(87)Day-Terms, Past and Future
Saturdayké=tsóítá ke=noo=ke‘four days ago’Sundayké=tsóítá=nokᵒ‘three days ago’Mondaynó=tsóo=nokᵒ‘two days ago’Tuesdaysáá=tso=sɪn‘yesterday’Wednesdaynó=ódwáá (=ne)‘today’Thursdaytáá barats-ᵒ‘tomorrow’Fridayké=tsói barats-ᵒ‘two days from now’Saturdayké=tsóítá=ke‘three days from now’Time expressions used to refer to years removed in the past or future are
built on the root kaɪnɪ́- ‘year’. This is also modified by proclitic and enclitic
demonstratives and exhibits phonological reduction and lexicalization. The
proclitic or prefix sá(á)- seen in both (87) and (88) no doubt is a parallel
with Dime’s (South Omotic) distal prefix sa- (Mulugeta 2008:73). In (88),
the term keináts contains the verb root ats- ‘come’, as in ‘the coming year’:

Ik greetings do not constitute a separate grammatical word class per se. But
they do consist of a variety of verb phrases and noun phrases used ritually
so as to take on pragmatic meaning beyond grammar and semantics. Given
the cultural importance of Ik greetings, they are presented below.
The most general greeting and the one usually first taught to outsiders is in
the form of a question:
(89)Iyida?","[490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497]"
"10.1.2 Contrastive
In its most basic expression, contrast or counter-expectation (as well as
addition) can be communicated in Ik through simple parataxis, or
‘intonational coordination’ (Serzisko 1992:120). Such apposition of two
main clauses leaves the precise pragmatic interpretation up to the context.
However, the clitic-like adverb (=)kɔtɔ is typically present to enhance the
utterance with such notions as ‘then’, ‘so’, ‘and’, and ‘but’, for example:562(9)Benia ncuk, buo kot.
bení-áɲ́cu-kᵒ ‖not.be-REAL I-COPbu-o=kótᵒ

náá=koto mo-o
CONJ =ADVbɛ́ɗ-ᶦnot-SEQ want-3SGLet him save you. But if he doesn’t want to,…
Some Ik speakers, especially those having learned other languages, find
alternative ways to express contrast. This may be for example, by borrowing
a contrast word from Karimojong (naít) or Swahili (lakini).","[593, 594]"
"129[ƙaátanaamuɲu]The third intonational pattern, called the solicitive tune, is used to solicit
agreement from the hearer. It is often heard in the following contexts: 1)
making polite requests or gentle commands, 2) making statements subject to
the hearer’s approval, and 3) ensuring the hearer’s attention. The solicitive
tune can apply to both main clauses and subordinate clauses (even ones
preceding the main clauses of declarative statements or questions.)
The solicitive tune is marked by a low-rising (LH) boundary tone. Unlike the
indicative and interrogative tunes, the final morpheme of a clause can
appear in either its non-final or final form. When the final form occurs,
vowels normally devoiced surface as voiced so as to link to the low-rising
tone to a tone-bearing unit. But because a) the LH boundary tone applies
only to the clauses’s final vowel and b) contour tones in Ik must link to two
phonological TBUs, the final vowel is doubled for the solicitive tune:
(83)Jʼeʝa naa aweee?
ʝɛʝ-a=nááawé-eéstay-REAL=PST1home-DATS/he stayed at home, (okay)?(awá-keé)130[ʝɛʝanááawéeé]Just as (83) shows the solicitive tune operating on a high-toned morpheme,
(84) shows the same tune applying to the low-toned muɲu ‘all’:
(84)Ƙaata na muɲuu?
ƙa-át-a=naamuɲuúgo-3PL-REAL=PST 1 all
They all went, (okay)?
[ƙaátanaamuɲuú]4 Nouns
As one of language’s ‘evolutionary primitives’ (Heine & Kuteva 2007:59),
nouns comprise one of Ik’s two large open word classes (the other being
verbs). The present chapter begins with an overview of noun roots (§4.1)
moving on then to nominal suffixes (§4.2), compounds (§4.3), and several
types of onomastics (§4.4.-§4.5). Case marking, a crucial feature of the
nominal system, is treated in Chapter 6 on the way to the wider grammar.
In Ik, a noun is any word whose primary function is to be the head of a
noun phrase, which in turn functions as an argument of a verb. As the head
of a noun phrase, a noun must be inflected for case to show its relation to
other words. It may also take other nominal suffixes and may be joined to
another noun or pronoun in a compound construction. A second function of
an Ik noun is to be the head of the predicate. To fulfil this function, a noun
must take the copulative case marker (§6.3.8), which is the functional
equivalent of a copula and allows the noun to stand alone as a sentence.
Semantically, the prototypical Ik noun refers to inanimate and animate
objects, people, and places—anything in the world that is viewed as an
inherent non-event. However, the boundary between things named by
nouns and events named by verbs is fuzzy. Many lexical event concepts can
become nouns with noun morphology or verbs with verb morphology, e.g.:
(1)Lexemes ambiguously nominal or verbal
botá-‘migrate’ƙɔ́ɗɛ́-‘cry’cooka-‘shepherd’ɔfa-‘cough’deƙu-‘quarrel’sáɡo-‘snare’ɗɔanɪ ́-‘weed’sʊpa-‘breathe’epú-‘sleep’taatsa-‘pay’féí-‘bathe’taʝala-‘give up’132fekí-‘laugh’tɔkɔba-‘farm’ɪ ̯ana-‘talk’tɔkɔra-‘distribute’ɪƙɪra-‘write’tɔlɔka-‘trap’ɪrɛʝa-‘slash grass’tɛwɛa-‘broadcast seed’iruɓa-‘chew hard foods’tóda-‘speak’isira-‘decorate’tsuwaa-‘run’ɪtsɪka-‘order’wáána-‘pray’ɪwara-‘plaster’waté-‘rain’ƙaƙa-‘hunt’zɛƙɔ́-‘sit/stay’Ik nominal morphology is minimal—four being the maximum number of
morphemes a single noun can have (outside of compounds). Compare this to
Turkana nouns which may have up to eleven morphemes (Dimmendaal
1983:208)ǃ Any Ik noun in a post-lexical grammatical context consists
minimally of a lexical root plus a case marker. Besides the case marker, the
only other nominal suffixes are number and possession markers. The order
in which these occur is ROOT-(NUMBER)-(POSSESSION)- CASE. Unlike Turkana
and Dhaasanac, Ik has no grammatical gender marked on nouns. Ik
compensates for its minimal noun inflection by joining nouns and pronouns
together in a variety of compounds. Thus, meanings expressed by affixes in
other languages are expressed by a compound construction in Ik.
In their basic underlying forms, every Ik nominal root and suffix ends in a
vowel, without exception. This final vowel is unpredictable since it can be
any of the language’s nine contrastive vowels. Because of this, these final
vowels are treated universally as part of the root in Ik. Similar ‘terminal
vowels’ in the East Cushitic Dhaasanac are only viewed as part of the stem
in some cases where they “are by and large meaningless elements…[maybe]
ancient desemanticized gender markers” (Tosco 2001:65). And like the
Omotic language Dime (Mulugeta 2008), Ik has some nouns whose rootfinal vowel has two free variants, e.g. kɔlá~kɔlɛ́- ‘goat’ and zɪná~zɪnɔ́‘zebra’. Such cases seem to arise along the lines of chronolects and idiolects.","[160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"
"5579.16.4 Negative tags
Ik has two negative ‘tags’ that can be used following either positive or
negative statements. When they are used, the speaker normally expects a
corresponding positive reply. These tags and their replies are as follows:
(254)Nta ƙamatii?Ƙamatadǃńt-áƙám-át-a=dᵉƙám-átì=ìINTERROGnot-REAL be.like-3PL[IRR]=DPbe.like-3PL-REAL=DPAre they (i.e. words) not like that? They are like thatǃ

"7A noun after a prepositionThe first function of the oblique case―marking the subject (A/S) of an
imperative or optative clause―is illustrated in the two following examples:
(36)Ƙae bi awak.
ƙa-ébiSgo-IMP.SGyou.sg[OBL] home-DATYou go homeǃawá-kᵉ248(37)Talake ʝa ngo ceiƙotima gaso.

And then (lit. ‘let go’) we just killed the warthog.
The second function―marking the object (O) of an imperative or optative
clause―is illustrated in (38) for imperative and (39) for optative:
(38)Dee ɗi nak.
d-e-eɗɪO=nákᵃbring-VEN-IMP.SGone[OBL]=DEM.SG.PST 1Bring the one of earlierǃ
(39)Nesibano nai na.
nesíb-anonaíO=nahear-OPThere[OBL]=DEM.SGLet’s listen here (i.e. ‘Let’s listen to this.’)
The third function of the oblique case―marking the complement of an
identity copula clause―is shown in the next two examples. In an Ik copula
clause of identity, the copula mɪt- ‘be (sth. or sb.)’ links the copula subject
(CS) with the copula complement (CC). As seen below, the copula subject
occurs in the nominative case, while the complement occurs in the oblique:
(40)Mitiya noo terega ntsie ɗusesi tsʼiƙae.
mit-i-a=nooteréɡ-aCSntsí-éɗus-ésíCCbe-PLUR-REAL=PST3 work-NOM he-GEN dip-INF[OBL]

wet.season[OBL]The land was wet season (i.e. it was wet season).tsʼɪƙá-ᵋ
bees-GEN249The fourth function of the oblique case is to mark the first element (N1) of a
nominal compound. The first nominal element must be in the oblique case,
while the second element takes whatever case the syntactic context calls for.
In this grammar, compounds are identified with a hyphen between the two
nouns or pronouns in question. (42) gives two examples of compounds in
isolation, and (43)-(44) give two in complete sentences:
(42)ɗerocemerepuaw

And the elders were sitting at the foot of the tree.
The fifth function of the oblique case is to mark the complement of a
