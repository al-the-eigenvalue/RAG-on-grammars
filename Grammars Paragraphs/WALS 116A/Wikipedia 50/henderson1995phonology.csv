What will you be doing?
There is an interesting example of a question identical to (67) except that the indefinite
morpheme is not used. Both questions occur in close proximity, in a narrative about Gregory
Mepe ' s work experience in Port Moresby. He left Rossel, and worked on a coastal ship for a
year, and then left the ship at Samarai. Gregory continues:
(69)a.b.",[49]
"IT. P- >C.SG.SB2. 1. 2 MOOD
I am using the term ' mood' to refer to a fuzzy parameter along which Yele makes three
structural distinctions, based on the type of speech act and the specificity of the action. These
distinctions are marked in the verbal prenucIeus and postnucIeus, and even affect the verb
root with some verbs. From the perspective of speech act, Yele makes only one major
distinction, namely that between informational speech and commands. Questions use the
same verb roots and exactly the same prenucIear and postnuclear components as do19
statements. Imperatives differ markedly in form from statements and questions. (Yes-no
questions differ from statements in intonation, and content questions contain a question
word. Otherwise they are the same as statements.) Thus Yele distinguishes morphologically
between informational speech and imperatival speech.
Within informational speech, Yele distinguishes between reference to specific events in
the past, present or future, as opposed to habitual events that people perform. The reference
to specific events is termed the indicative mood in this paper, while the reference to habitual
events is the habitual mood. Table 2. 1.2. 1 shows these distinctions diagrammatically.
TABLE 2. 1. 2. 1: PARAMETERS ALONG WHICH YELE MOODS ARE DISTINGUISHEDSpecific
InformationalIndicative moodSpecificity
HabitualHabitual moodSpeech act
CommandImperatival moodThe term 'imperative' is used for first person and third person forms as well as for second
person forms, as imperatival forms with all three persons of subject share two features in
common:
1 . All imperatival forms with punctiliar events have a tense distinction between
commands or suggestions to be carried out immediately and those to be deferred
until a later time. (See §2. 1. 3 below.)
2. All immediate imperatival forms with punctiliar events have a zero prenucleus. (See
Table 2. 1.5. 2 below.)
The morphological differences between the moods are difficult to characterise, because of
the portmanteau representation of a number of parameters at once. The following examples
illustrate the differences. The details are presented in §2. 1A and §2. 1.5 below.

The definite morpheme w- is nearly always used with future questions ( 1 0 1 ), but is not
used with a negative future statement with a first or second person subject. (Compare ( 1 00)
and ( 1 02).)[Naa tedel L �-a -nyi( 10 1 )ni?feast place D-FUT-IND.FUT.2SG.SB go.PCT

optional. In fact, the meaning of w- is rather difficult to determine in future positive
statements. In some texts it correlates fairly closely with duration, punctiliar events using w-,
continuous events not using it. Compare ( 1 03a) with ( 1 03b).

The Head noun of the phrase can be specified by a deictic, a question word or a

In (69c), the priest assumes that Gregory is employed at Samarai, and asks what his
employment is, which Gregory translates without using ngme- . In (7 1 b), his conception of
Gregory ' s intended action in Rabaul is less definite, so Gregory reports his question usingngme-.

situation is a little more definite now - the processing has begun and should not be
interrupted until it is completed. And so the clauses through to 5b all use w-a -nyi, but 5c uses
a-nyi, apparently because it refers to some generic prior time at which the firewood should
have been gathered. The definite situation marked with w- is resumed in 9a with further steps
in the copra-making process, until the end of the process is reached in 1 1 a, and the copra is
in the shed on the wharf waiting for shipping to market.
Sentence 1 4 begins an evaluative paragraph which presents the consequences of
processing copra well or badly, and this more general situation is indicated by the absence of
w-. So far so good. But why is w- used in sentence 1 7 ? Sentence 17 is essentially the same
condition and consequence as are found in 1 5, which does not have W-. It seems that here the
w- is used as a prominence marker, to highlight the responsibility a man has to process his
copra properly. And the w- is continued in sentence 18 to enforce the conclusion.
(3) Incorporating the deictic ala
The deictic ala ' this' (close to the speaker) has a parallel in a 'close ' , which occurs in the
predicate prenucleus to mark motion towards the speaker or proximity to the speaker.
Although the basic form is a, the morpheme takes a number of different forms, as presented
in the matrices A-7 and A-8 in the appendix. In some cases, a 'close' is added unchanged to
the 'unmarked' predicate prenucleus ( 1 04). (The added a is written as a separate word in the
practical orthography to avoid confusion with a long vowel within a morpheme. Where a
'close' is added, there is a pitch glide from the unmarked prenucleus down to the a, but this
does not occur with normal long vowels.)
( 1 04) a.","[58, 59]"
"FUT-CI.FUT. I PL.SB-MOT playing
We' ll go and play (football) (tomorrow).
The morpheme takes a number of forms, depending on the combination of tense and
mood, and the person and number of the subject. These forms are displayed in Tables A-5
and A-6 in the appendix.
The simplest strategy used to indicate that motion is involved in the event is simply to
suffix -n:aa to the predicate prenucleus. This strategy is used with the following categories of
events:
A:punctiliar habitual or indicative immediate past with non third person Subject
(compare (8 I a) and (8 I b))B: punctiliar deferred imperative with fIrst person Subject (82)

"2.3.2.2 LOGIC AL RELATIONSHIPS
Each of the logical relationships distinguished in Yele will be discussed in tum, using the
terminology of Beekman et. al . ( 1 98 1 : 95- 1 07). All relationships can be expressed by the
juxtaposition of clauses without any marking of the semantic relationship involved. In fact, it
is rare to have the semantic relationship signalled in the surface structure.
The texts in §2.4 have been chosen to illustrate as many of these relationships as possible,
so frequently reference will be made to examples in the texts, rather than including the
examples in this section.
( l ) CONTRAST
""The relation of CONTRAST occurs between two communication units when there are at
least two points of difference between them and one point of similarity. One of the points of
difference involves an opposition"" (Beekman et. al. : p. 1 00). A simple example of contrast
where the clauses are juxtaposed without indicating the semantic relationship is:
(247) a.",[87]
"CT-PI.IM.PST.2SG.SB miss
You really blew it that time ! (lit. You missed badly.)
Although <16-> is frequently used in conversation, it is generally only used at the first
opportunity in a monologue, quoted speech excepted, of course. Text (a) in §2.4 is a good
example.
(2) Incorporating the deictic wu
The future counterpart of certainty ( 'in sight') is definiteness ( w-), from wu 'out of sight ' .
The morpheme w- is obligatory with negative future punctiliar indicative forms with a third
person subject ( 1 00).",[57]
"This morpheme can also be used with the force of English 'still', as in example (77).
(77) a.",[51]
"PLIM.PST . l SG.SB .NEG eat.FOL T.PI .REM. 3PL.O.MF

I didn't eat them (today).
c.",[64]
"RESULT of (95c), (d), (h) and (i)
(AMPLIFICATION of (a))As listed in Table 2. 1 . 7 . 5 . 1 , ala and mu have cataphoric reference when used i n
discourse, and wu and yi have anaphoric reference. Discussion with the speaker o f this text,
Raymond, confirmed that ala used in clause (95a) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (c) and (d), and that its use in clause (g) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (h) and (i). He also said that mu in clause (h) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (h) and (i). Mu seems to be used here rather than ala, because it introduces another
following REASON, as mu is used as a deictic to refer to an 'other' entity. When asked
about yi in clause U), he said it referred to all the previous REASONs. Concerning wu in
(96a) and (96c), he said it referred to the earlier pair of REASONs in (95c) and (95d). There
is a parallel here between the real-world usage of wu to refer to an entity which is out of
sight. The earlier pair of preceding REASONs is 'out of sight' compared with the later pair
of preceding REASONs.
Five of these deictics have parallels in the predicate prenucleus with similar meanings. For
example, the basic form of the certainty prefix is Ja''.., and its typical use is to indicate that the
speaker was an eyewitness to an event. While kJ- and its variants are used with non-future
indicative events, future indicatives (that is events that have not been ' seen' yet) can be
marked with w- 'definiteness' in the same position in the predicate prenucleus.
( 1 ) Incorporating the deictic kJ
The incorporation of the other deictics is described in detail below, but first let us examine
kJ- and W-. The basic form kJ- merges into the predicate prenucleus. In the present tense of
continuous events, it takes the form k-, and is used only with third person subjects.

doer of somethingWhen interpreting sequences of vowels such as [k!e] 'bite', there are no sequences of low
vowels such as * [£0] on which to base an interpretation as a sequence of two vowel
phonemes. All vowel sequences involve a high or mid close vowel, suggesting that
palatalisation, labialisation or a semivowel is involved. Palatalisation and labialisation both
contrast with sequences of a higher vowel followed by a lower vowel, as shown in Table
1.1.13.

semivowel-vowel, to avoid a sequence of vowels. Thus two items of Table 1.1.13 are
interpreted as follows:

PUW8lean against
started itBy analogy, sequences of [i] followed by a lower vowel are interpreted as having [y]
between the [i] and the lower vowel:
[k!a]
[k!:G]is interpreted as
is interpreted askigha ripe
kight grandfatherThis interpretation is supported by dialect variation. The eastern dialect word [k!e] kighe
'lizard type' corresponds in the western dialect with [ki�e] kike. Further evidence for the
interpretation was found by dictation testing. I asked the test subjects to dictate test words
slowly so I could write them, breaking the words into syllables. Words such as [k!e] 'bite'5were dictated as [lei - j£] rather than as [ki - £] or [k!£]. Furthermore, people who had
been taught to write [i] as f and [y] as gh wrote words such as [lc!a] 'ripe' as kigha, thus
filling the gap in the distribution of [i] and [y], in that [y] never follows [i] in speech.
The remaining vowel sequences are �i], �i], �i] and @i]. These are interpreted as oy, ey,
ey and ay respectively. For example, [y�i] 'fall' is interpreted as ghay. Table 1.1.14 showsthese sequences in contrast with plain vowels.","[11, 12, 13]"
"6
1.2 CONSONANTSThere are four points of articulation: bilabial, dental, post- alveolar and velar. The basic
manners of articulation are stops, nasal continuants, non- nasal continuants and two
semivowels, as illustrated in Table 1.2.1.

[I)a:] listenng:aa
[ya:] slashghfiiiWhen the Yele practical orthography was being devised, some equivalents were
straightforward, such as p for the bilabial stop and k for the velar stop. Others required some
care. For example, t was chosen to represent the dental phoneme and d to represent the post­
alveolar phoneme, because some Rossel people were already writing these sounds this way,
and because the post-alveolar stop is partially voiced word medially adjacent to a short vowel
and so it is similar to d in English. The digraph th was rejected by the Rossel people as a
representation for one of these phonemes, because the nearby Sudest language has [0] in its
inventory, and the Rossels did not want there to be any confusion with that sound. The
dental and post-alveolar nasals posed a problem, as the English alphabet does not provide
any equivalent in the nasals to t and d, so the acute accent used to mark close vowels was
borrowed and pressed into service to mark the dental nasal. The velar nasal is represented by
ng to match English usage. The velar fricative is represented on Goodenough Island by g,
but gh was chosen for the Yele orthography to avoid confusion with the symbols used for a
prenasalised velar stop uttered with simultaneous bilabial closure (mg).
The non-dental stops are partially voiced word medially when adjacent to a short vowel.
For the post-alveolar stop, this results in a manifestation as [r] in that environment.pepe

turtleThere is a contrastive series of prenasalised stops, in which the speech power of the
prenasalisation is much greater than that of the stop. Hence they are referred to as the7prenasalised series, rather than as a voiced series with accompanying prenasalisation. The
contrasts are illustrated in Table 1.2.2.

sago pulpnkaaSince the orthographic symbols t and d were already in use to symbolise the dental / post­
alveolar contrast, and to give weight to the significance of the prenasalisation, the
prenasalised stops are represented in the practical orthography by nasal-stop pairs. Thus nt
and nd represent the dental and post-alveolar stops respectively when they are prenasalised.
mb was chosen for the bilabial stop rather than mp, because of pressure from the English
orthography. For the velar stop, ngg was first introduced, as is used in a number of Papua
New Guinea languages, but Rossel people failed to notice the second g when reading and
used not to write it, so the representation of [IJg] was changed to nk. This was well accepted,
and has proven easy to teach.
The post-alveolar and velar stops can also be uttered with nasal release, which is
characterised by nasal plosion. Table 1.2.3 shows these two basic stops alone, with pre­
nasalisation and with nasal release.

1CHAPTER 1
PHONEMES AND PORTMANTEAU ORTHOGRAPHYThere are eleven contrastively different vowels in Yele. Vowel length and nasalisation are
also contrastive. Consonants have four points of articulation: bilabial, dental, post-alveolar
and velar. They are articulated as stops, nasal continuants, non-nasal continuants and
semivowels. The stops can also be prenasalised or uttered with nasal release. All but two of
the non-bilabial consonants can be uttered with simultaneous bilabial closure. Palatalisation
and labialisation are also contrastive, and even occur simultaneously when attached to bilabial
stops and nasals. This mouthful of contrasts adds up to 38 different vowel sounds and 56
different consonantal sounds to listen for.
The analytical model u sed is traditional phonemics (Pike 1947), adj usted to allowsecondary phonemes analogous to suprasegmentals or Firth' s prosodies ( Palmer 1970).
The IPA set of phonetic characters is used in this description, and in words of more than one
syllable the stressed syllable is underlined. [j] and [w] represent semivowels. No strictly
phonemic transcriptions are used, because of the difficulty in symbolising simultaneous
bilabial closure in a meaningful way. Semi-phonemic transcriptions are given in italics, using
the practical alphabet that has arisen as a result of this study and which is now in use
amongst the Rossel Island people.
1.1 VOWELS
Vowel length and nasalisation are both contrastive, along with the eleven basic vowel
quality phonemes shown in Table 1.1.1. The italic symbols show how these phonemes are
represented in the practical orthography.

(43) shows the root vyu wo 'look' with its goal not incorporated, and (44) shows two goals
typically incorporated with this verb.

This section deals with the order of items in clauses manifesting verbal predications.
§2. 1 .9 deals with non-verbal predications.
( 1 ) Presence of explicit subjects and objects
Since the prenuclear and postnuclear components of the Yele verb mark the subject and
object of the predication so fully, these referents are frequently not specified by nouns or
noun phrases. Typically, they are made explicit where they enter a discourse, or where the
referents change, and elsewhere are carried just by the markers in the verb. For example, text
(a) in §2.4 introduces the author in the verbal prenucleus of clause 1 , and thereafter his
identity is carried by the verbal markers. He introduces his brother Nkal by name in clause
6a, and the quote formulae in their conversation keep track of the speakers. Nkal refers to
fish with a noun in 6c. Third person objects are introduced with nouns in clause l Ob 'I didn't
see anyone' and 1 1 b 'I chewed some betel nut' . The author refers to his father with a kin58
term in 1 2c, and quotes h i s father' s use o f h i s own name in 1 3b. H i s father also mentions
fish with a noun, in 1 5b.
Where there is more than one third person referent on stage at a time in a discourse, the
subjects and objects are made explicit more often, to ensure that the hearer can keep track of
the referents of the clauses. (As is often the case, folk stories show less explicit reference to
the participants, because everyone knows who does what in the story, and it is not necessary
to be as explicit. Everyone knows, that is, except the linguist from another culture!). Text (d)
in §2.4 provides an example of a text with more than one third person referent on stage at a
time. It is by the same author as the fishing story referred to above. The topic of the text is a
savage dog, which is introduced and named in clause l a, then referred to with third person
singular verb parts in clause 1 b. The author disclaims responsibility in sentence 2 ,
introducing himself with a pronoun, and using the word 'dog' in sentence 3 . H e names the
culprit, his brother Nkal, with a noun, and uses the word 'dog' again in sentence 4. Nkal ' s
name is repeated i n sentence 5, but this time the other third person referent i s understood to
be the dog, without specific reference. The dog is mentioned again specifically in the next
sentence, number 6. It remains the topic of the rest of that paragraph, sentences 7 to 9, being
referred to only pronominally. Sentence 1 0 begins a narrative episode, in which Mepe and
his son Yidika are introduced by name. In this episode each sentence uses a noun to refer to
one of these actors, as the initiative moves from one third person referent to another in quick
succession. The result of the incident comes in sentence 1 7, but the dog is not mentioned
specifically - it is just the third person singular referent of the verb. The text ends with a
specific reference to a safe road for people to follow.
(2) Order of items in the clause
Apart from the subject and object of the clause, other items can be included at will when
their semantic content is to be made explicit, up to a limit of five items in any one clause,
including the predicate. The histogram in Table 2. 1 .8 . 1 shows the proportion of transitive
and intransitive clauses having each number of items. The histogram is based on a sample of
667 clauses all from texts or conversation.","[65, 66]"
