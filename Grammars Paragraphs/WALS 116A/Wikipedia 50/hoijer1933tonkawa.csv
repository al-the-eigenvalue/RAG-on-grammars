difficult to separate the two suffixes. Considering, in the first and
second persons, -a-n'e- as the modal suffix instead of simply a
the pronouns would be -c and -i, respectively, analogous to other
pronominal forms. However, such an analysis will not suffice in the
forms for the third person and the indefinite pronoun. The indefinite
pronoun form is unique with this paradigm and even here is used
only for the passive forms (cf. 62).
The pronouns in the subordinating paradigm are unique in that
series — the pronoun -yo- for the second person being used in no
other series unless we are to consider the final -i of -n'ei as a cognate
form.
The subjective pronouns appearing in another of the subordinating paradigms (cf. 67) are so bound up with the modal suffixes that
it appears impossible to isolate them. This paradigm is illustrated
below with the verb theme ya-dje- to see, look at . . .

the first and third person personal pronouns are, therefore, -nec
and zero. The problem is: what sort of contraction has occurred in
the second person forms where, obviously, the suffix -e-gwa plus
some unknown quantity indicating the second person pronoun has
resulted in the form -e-gen? And, further, the third person plural
form has also been contracted in an irregular manner and, in both
cases, seems to have inserted the pronoun between the theme and
the tense-modal suffix. These questions cannot be answered since
there are no analagous contractions elsewhere in the language.
Finally, we have series used in the -Jc participial forms (cf. 74),
and in certain other subordinating paradigms (cf. 65). They are as
follows:

"23. Word Order.
The normal word order of the Tonkawa sentence is subject,
object and verb. It is, however, not a necessary order since syntactic
relations are sufficiently indicated by suffixes. Word order is only
important in distinguishing the functions of certain modifiers.
That is, the distinction between adjective and adverb depends upon
the position of the form in question. If the modifier stands betweenHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIANLANGUAGES27a noun and its formal suffix, it has adjectival function ; if it stands
directly before a verb, it has adverbial function. Examples:
gwa'n-enox-la
henox yagnano'a pretty woman
he shoots wellha',ago'n-gwa'lo'dak-la
gwa'lo'dak bandjalo'a very big man
he opens his mouth very widely24. Reduplication.
The grammatical processes described in the preceding sections
have all related to alternations of theme with affix or theme with
theme. Reduplication is the only grammatical process which varies
the internal form of the theme itself. The whole theme is rarely
repeated: generally only one element (i. e. phonologic element) is
repeated (cf. 37). The function of reduplication is to indicate
repeated action. Examples:
dobododobo-to cut
to cut repeatedlyy'odjoy'oy'o'djoto pinch
to pinch repeatedlyx'elex'ex'ele-to sharpen (e. g. a knife)
to sharpen repeatedlyA. T H E V E R B ( 2 582)25. General Remarks.
The elements making up a verb complex may be divided into
three classes according to their position in the word: theme affixes,
theme, and theme suffixes. The first and last of these classes are the
same in function; that is, they provide for the grammatical and
syntactical relations of the verb and also serve to amplify the
meaning of the theme. The theme itself contains no formal elements;
its meaning is the concrete, the basic one of the verb form. An
example will make this clear.
ge-nec-xa-ile-nec'-o-'they two cause me to throw it to
a distanceTheme: -He-, the reduced form of yale- to throw, hit with a missile.
Theme prefixes: ge- me; nec- causative; xa- with force, to a distance.
Theme suffixes: -nec', dual subject; -o, declarative mode; -', third
person, present tense.","[36, 37]"
"Notice, in the last list, that the reduplicated forms repeat the second
element of the theme.
This variation in phonetic behavior taken in connection with the
first example quoted on page 40 would seem to indicate that haplus another initial theme element of the class of na- does not
elide according to the law of vocalic elision, whereas ha- attached
directly to a theme does vary phonetically according to this rule.
In other words, the themes of the first list seem to contain traces
of other theme elements of the wa-class: perhaps, at one time, there
was a complete list of such elements classifying various types of
object. This is, of course, only a suggestion: no further proof of
such an organization can be adduced.
The test forms for ha- are more definitive than any discussed
heretofore. For example:
yagonaha'gona-to hit . . . with the fist tr.
to box intr. (ha- plus ya- >yaxgocaha'xaxgoca-to follow . . . tr.
several go in single fileyadcaha'daca-to stab . . . tr.
several stab each other; a fight with
knives takes placeha--)In all of these forms, the addition of ha- appears to confine the
action to an object expressed within the theme: to make the action
intransitive as far as the English translation is concerned. We have
seen, however, that Tonkawa verbs do not fall into definitely
transitive and intransitive classes: that there appears to be no
consistently formal distinction between transitive and intransitive
verbs in Tonkawa. Rather, the question of transitivity seems bound
up with the analysis of the theme. Thus, while hangaba- is transitive
in the sense that it may take an object (ga-ngabo' it sticks to me;
hangaba-we' it sticks to you), the subject is limited to a certain
type of object apparently once clearly defined by na-, and ha- does
not affect the transitivity of the whole verb theme but expresses an42HOIJEB, TONKAWAindirect relationship between the elements -n- and -gaba- of the
theme. In other words, the question of the transitivity of the whole
theme with regard to an object expressed by a theme affix is bound
up with the relationship — direct, indirect, or instrumental —
between elements of the theme. I do not believe, therefore, that hais necessarily an element indicating the intransitivity of the whole
theme (indeed, that point is contradicted by many of the hathemes), but that it has to do with the more important relations
between elements of the theme in much the same way as ya- and neappear to serve this function. The curious and apparently contradictory facts of theme variation discussed so far can, at least
speculatively, be explained by postulating two theme elements
either standing in direct relationship one to another (the prefixless themes) or being indirectly related by one or other of the first
position themes elements (ha-, ne-, ya- themes). It is not necessary
of course, to assume that all themes have both these elements —
some of the prefix-less themes may be composed of only one;
others, which appear transitive, may have a limited transitivity
due to the inclusion within its structure of an element designating
or referring to a possible object (cf. 28). This theory of theme structure cannot be proven: but, as I have said, it appears to be an
hypothesis that does justice to the few test forms that exist. In the
following sections, we shall find further confirmation, or, rather,
further indications that this theory has some degree of validity.
32. he- Themes.
The element he- is on the border line between the first position
theme elements which have been discussed and the theme prefixes.
In fact, there is no formal difference between he- and the reflexive
pronoun he- (cf. 43) except that the themes containing the theme
element he- cannot be used without it. he- also does not elide its
vowel when preceded by a single element prefix, a behavior
characteristic of theme prefixes.

There are a great number of themes in this class — it is the second
largest group of themes in Tonkawa, the largest class being the
prefix-less themes. The following list is arranged in order of increasing complexity of theme form, the simplest coming first. Since
these themes have no reduced forms — or, rather, since their reduced forms are the same as the full forms — only two forms will
be given for each theme — the full form and the reduplicated form.

to stretch one's neckIt will be seen from the above list that he- appears to give a
medio-passive significance to the theme — limiting the action to
the subject. It is evident, however, that this factor does not affect
the ultimate transitivity of the whole theme. For, though most of
the themes are intransitive or confined to a reflexive object, one44HOIJER TONKAWAof them (e. g., hendaidja- to chew) is transitive. It is possible here
that -n- is the reduced form of -na-, the incorporated object (cf. 28),
and that the verb is therefore limited in transitivity. Just to what
spheres of influence these different elements are confined and how
they combine to result in the present meanings, cannot, of course,
be determined since we are unable to isolate the other theme elements. As was the case with ya-, ne-, and ha-, it is quite possible
that the function of he- is bound up with that of the other theme
elements and not with the formal relations of the whole theme to
its object.
The test forms following confirm the impression that he- gives
medio-passive significance to the theme.

forms follow:

The consonantal scheme has the rather unique feature of globalized nasals, spirants, sibilants and laterals. These glottalized consonants, as well as the glottalized stops, appear almost exclusively
as initial consonants of complex elements (cf. 13). The question of
their being basic consonants is, therefore, contingent upon the
structure of the complex element. As will be shown later, the
complex element is not always susceptible to closer analysis: for
this reason and because of the rarer cases of the occurrence of
glottalized consonants in unanalyzable forms, these consonants
have been listed as on a par with the others. The bilabial stop b
never appears in the glottalized form even when it is the initial of a
complex element comparable to those requiring a glottalized
initial consonant. A unique feature is the glottalized gw', in which
the glottal stop affects not the stop but its labialization. This
feature is, however, congruent with the rest of the system: in all
cases the glottal closure survives the oral closure and, when the
nasals, spirants, sibilants, and laterals are glottalized, the glottal
stop always follows.

"These examples show the usage of this form in direct discourse
when the question of tense or mode is not important. An expression
of fact about oneself: a desire, or announcement of intention, or a
suggestion.
The form may also be used with the future tense suffix -a-do-,
-a'dew- as follows:
hedjedo'n hcrn-a'do-nec I'll go back, hedjedjo'n back, here used adverbially
(cf. 87); ha'na- one person goes off. Note t h a t t h e person suffix is

87); -'ei- t o goThe future tense suffix used in this way seems to connote intention or the immediate future. Compare this usage with that
illustrated in section 55.
(a) The Tense and Mode Suffixes(55—63)55. The Declarative Mode.
The suffix for the declarative mode is an element -we which may
also have the form -o under certain phonetic conditions (cf. 17).
It is always used with a tense suffix: the declarative mode may,
therefore, be subdivided into four tenses, the present, the past, the
near future, and the remote future.

The full forms of both suffixes appear in the third person plural
with second person object. I n all but the two third person plural
forms, the tense suffix -e has the reduced form and in the second
person singular forms, it has been elided altogether causing the
vowel preceding it to be lengthened compensatively. Note t h a t the
declarative mode suffix has the contracted form -o except when
preceded by a long vowel (cf. 17).
This form defines a time between the immediate present and the
past: a line in time, as it were, as opposed to a point in time. For
this reason, it might just as well be termed the immediate past.
The following examples from the texts will bring out its meaning. 1

the moment of time referred to. I n some contexts, it defines habitual
or customary activity. Thus,

"CHAPTER I I : MORPHOLOGY (20—96)
20. Introductory.
The distinctive treatment accorded theme and theme affix is no
less important to the study of Tonkawa structure than it is for the
phonology. The theme, defined as the invariable portion of a word
form, carries the concrete significance of the word — the affixes
serve either to amplify (or restrict) this meaning or to relate the
word to the rest of the sentence.
The theme can, then, be studied quite apart from the affix. The
rules governing its structure and the elements composing it, if they
could be isolated, would give information as to the ""prehistory""
of Tonkawa. That is, variation in theme form is not relevant to the
grammar of the language. But, the theme, as it exists today, is a
petrified formation and it is not easy to determine whether or not
it is analyzable into smaller morphologic units. We shall see later
that some themes yield to analysis and, on this evidence, it is
possible to speculate upon its former structure.
Grammatical variations in Tonkawa words are accomplished
chiefly by affixation. The predominant grammatical process is
suffixation: the definite article, case, number, tense, mode, subordination, and aspect are all expressed by suffixes. Prefixes are
used much more sparingly — there are no more than six altogether.
They are more concrete in meaning than the suffixes, generally
adding significance to the word rather than serving to relate it to
other words in the sentence.
The degree of cohesion between theme and affix is rather slight:
there is never any difficulty in breaking up a word form. In other
words, agglutination is the predominant technique, although there
is, in the case of a few suffixes, a tendency towards a fusional
technique. Verb prefixes and the case suffixes of the noun exhibit a
surprising lack of unity with and dependence on the theme. Between
a noun and its case suffix may be inserted two, or even three,
modifiers and there are many examples of such suffixes being quite
independent of any particular theme; serving, instead, to modify
whole clauses. To sum up, the variation in combinatory technique
is from a very loose semi-independent type of affix to a combination
of theme and affix rather firmly welded with decided dependence
of affix upon theme.
To apply the classificatory notion of ""parts of speech"" to Tonkawa would be to do extreme violence to the spirit of the language.
I t is much more in accord with this feeling to divide all words into24HOIJER TONKAWAtwo very general classes: independent themes, i. e., those which
can stand alone, and themes which must be completed in meaning
by one or more affixes. These are, of course, purely formal divisions.
The essential criteria of function are the affixes which may be
attached to the theme in question and the position that theme may
occupy in the sentence. Thus, the word,
he is arrivingxa'x-ano'is composed of the theme xa~x- to arrive, plus certain verbal
affixes. But this complex may also take noun suffixes; thus,
xa'x-ano'-'a'lathe one to arrivewhere -'a'la is not an agentive or relative suffix but the regular
noun suffix for the nominative singular definite case. This variation
in function according to suffix and position is even more clearly
illustrated by the following where the same theme — t'cel up, above —
becomes either nominal, adverbial, or adjectival in function according as these criteria are varied.
t'cel-'a'y'ik ha'no'
t'cel ha'no'
na'don-t'cel-'a'y'ik
ha'no'he goes to the top
he goes upwards
he goes to the top of the mountainIn the first sentence, t'cel, used with a noun suffix is nominal in
function; in the second, standing directly before the verb, it is
adverbial; and, in the last, inserted between a noun and its suffix,
it has adjectival significance. ""Parts of speech"" in Tonkawa, then,
are, formally, simply two — independent themes and themes plus
affixes. The former includes words which may be nominal, adjectival,
pronominal, or adverbial in function; the latter, words having
verbal significance and particles.
The Tonkawa sentence is dominated by the verb complex. It
includes the subject and object pronouns and defines the tense,
mode, and aspect of the action. It is rarely, however, that any verb
is equivalent to a sentence: other words are always necessary to
complete the proposition. The verb is the most complex in structure
and is generally synthetic with a tendency towards a polysynthetic
structure. Nouns generally take only two suffixes; the case suffixes
and the definite article. Modifiers, inserted between noun and case
suffix, complicate its structure: it is hardly possible, however, to
regard combinations of noun and modifier as unified word complexes; they are better described as compounds.
GRAMMATICAL PROCESSES ( 2 1 — 2 4 )21. Affixation.
The prefixes are all mixed relational in character; that is, they
serve both to add significance to the word and to relate it to otherHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN I N D I A NLANGUAGES25words in the sentence. They are all verbal prefixes — no noun
prefixes have been isolated. Three of them are pronominal objects,
ge- me, we- them, and geu- us, the last being a combination of the
first two (cf. 41). There are also two causative prefixes (cf. 50), and
a transitivizer restricted in usage to particular themes (cf. 36).
A prefix da-- is used in combination with the pronominal prefixes to
indicate the indirect object of an intransitive verb. Finally, there
is an adverbial prefix, xa-, x- to a distance, with force. Examples
follow:
yamx -o'c
ge-imax -o'
we-imax -o'c
geu-yamx -o'I paint his face
he paints my face

xe-edjn -o'cI lie down
I fall downgec'adjo'
'ei-gec'adjo'chis (e. g. back) is broken
I break his (back)Suffixes are much more numerous. They, too, are predominantly
mixed relational in form and, generally, those with greater concrete
significance come nearer the theme than those having less concrete
meaning (i. e., the more formal suffixes). Verbal suffixes are much
more dependent upon the theme than are the noun suffixes. The
latter, in fact, appear to have a semi-independent character as
illustrated in the following examples.
yadjox'an -'a'lak
ya'djo'c
yadjox'an -gwa'lou-awaadak-'a'lak ya'djo'cI see the tipi
I see the very tall, big tipiIn the first sentence, the formal suffix - a-lalc is attached directly to
the noun yadjox'an, tipi. But, in the second the modifiers gwa-lou
big, hawai tall, and hadak very are inserted between the noun and
its formal suffix.
I n the verb, the subject pronouns, number, mode, tense, aspect,
and subordination are indicated by suffixes. The suffixes of the
noun express case and the definite article: some demonstratives,
too, may be regarded as noun suffixes (cf. 91).","[32, 33, 34, 35]"
"HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIANLANGUAGES81The positions of these suffixes in the verb form vary according
to certain combinations which may be summarized, as follows:
1. Theme — Negative suffix — Future tense — Dual or
Plural — Pronoun.
2. Theme — Negative suffix — Future tense — Dual or
Plural — Continuative — Mode (declarative) — Tense
(present or past) — Pronoun — Mode (interrogative).
3. Theme — Negative — Future tense — Dual or plural —
Pronoun — Mode (assertive or subordinating).
4. Theme — Negative — Dual or plural — Mode (intentive,
imperative, or potential) — Pronoun.
5. Theme — Negative — Pronoun — -k — Mode (hortatory).
6. Theme — Negative — Future tense — Dual or plural —
Continuative — Pronoun
k — Mode (declarative, interrogative, resultative, quotative, or subordinating).
The first of the above schemes illustrates the simplest form in
which a verb may appear. This form is tense-less, except for the
future, and entirely mode-less. I t is used only in the first person
singular, dual, and plural and to express threatening or annunciatory intention in direct discourse (cf. 54).
It is evident that the tense suffixes are of two categories, the first
including only that for the future, the second those for the present
and the past. These two categories are not mutually exclusive: the
modes built up according to the second of the above schemes can
be sub-divided into four tenses: present, past, future of the present
(near future — sometime within the day), and the future of the past1
(remote future — sometime from tomorrow on to infinity). The
future suffix may also be used in other mode forms ordinarily tenseless : only the intentive, imperative, hortatory, and potential modes
are completely tense-less. The future suffix used in otherwise
tenseless forms generally indicates an indefinite future (some
unspecified time in the future).
It appears also that there are three modal positions in the verb —
the first before the pronoun, the second after the pronoun, and the
third attached to a -k (participial, cf. 74) form of the verb. The
declarative and interrogative modes may either be formed by
suffixes attached to a -k form or by means of scheme 2. These differ
in that the former connotes completed action (cf. 77). There is but
one aspect suffix — that for the continuative. This may be used in
all forms except the intentive, imperative, potential, and certain of
the subordinating modes.
1 That is, the future tense suffix
is employed with the suffix for the
past tense. This combination functions as a distant or remote future,
cf. section 55, IV.","[90, 91]"
"CHAPTER I. PHONOLOGY (2—19)
2. Introductory.
The Tonkawa word is composed of two major units or sets of
units. The first of these is the theme or invariable portion of the
word form. These rarely stand alone but are completed in meaning
by several affixes which amplify the meaning of the theme and
serve to relate it to other words in the sentence. There is never any
difficulty in distinguishing theme and affix: the technique binding
them together is prevailingly agglutinative. Thus, in the following
forms:
yamx-o'c
ge-imax-o'
yavnx-a'ha'aI paint his face
he paints my face
I shall paint his facethe theme is yamx- or -imax- and the affixes, -o'c first person
singular present tense, declarative mode; ge- first person object
pronoun; -o' third person singular present tense, declarative mode;
and -a-ha'a first person singular, intentive mode.
The theme in this particular case is disyllabic as are the vast
majority of verb and noun themes of Tonkawa. I t is evident, too,
that it changes in form according to its position in the verb: e. g.
contrast yamx- of the first example with -imax- of the second. This
alternation in phonetic form illustrates the most far-reaching
phonetic law in Tonkawa — that of vocalic elision by which every
other element in the theme (this rule does not apply to affixes) is
""reduced"", i. e., either loses its vowel altogether or has its vowel
shortened. I t follows, then, t h a t themes are built up, phonetically
at least, of smaller units which we shall call ""elements."" These
elements are, roughly speaking, of two types: simple elements,
composed of consonant plus vowel, and complex elements, composed
of consonant plus vowel plus consonant. Furthermore, these elements vary in form according to their position in the word — the
odd numbered elements having a ""full"" form and the even numbered
elements being ""reduced"" in form. The details of this phonetic law
must come later (cf. 5); the matter is mentioned here in order to
illustrate the fact t h a t the phonology of Tonkawa is best considered,
not as directly affecting the individual phoneme, but as affecting
combinations of such phonemes or elements. I n other words, the
basic word building unit (phonologically considered) is not the
individual sound but the element.
As mentioned above, this peculiar alternation of elements is true
only of the theme. Affixes do not vary their form no matter what
12HOIJER TONKA WAposition they hold in the word. Phonologically, then, there are
three types of element: simple theme elements, complex theme
elements and affixed elements — the first two sub-classes contrasting with the last in phonetic treatment. Affixes fall also into two
divisions: those identical with a single element and those composed
of two or more elements. Disyllabic affixes are not separable,
however, and must be treated as units.
Returning now to the word, we find it composed of several
element groups rather loosely bound together. The elements of any
one of these groups form a firmly knit unit — one that is rarely
(in the case of themes) or never (for affixes) separable. It appears
likely that themes represent the oldest of these structures; in fact,
as we shall see later (cf. 13) they are ""petrified"" formations. It is
not now possible to form new themes on the analogy of the old —
words in the language that can definitely be said to be new are
invariably compounds of older themes. Nor is it possible to vary
the essential structure of the theme except in a few rare cases.
We shall then, consider the phonetic laws of Tonkawa as they
apply directly to the three types of word building elements and
how, in this indirect way, they affect the individual phoneme.
3. The Vowel.
Tonkawa recognizes both short and long vowels as basic phonemes. In some cases, it can be shown that long vowels result from
certain contractions (cf. 9—13); in others, contractions cannot be
demonstrated. In the same way, the diphthongs listed below are
basic — i. e., while in many cases diphthongs can be proven to
result from contractions, other unanalyzable word forms also
contain diphthongs.

"/'e-kla
Then(15) na-gw, interjection (cf. 96). ma-ga- to weep, -abe- negative
suffix (cf. 53), and -u imperative suffix (cf. 61). Note that the final
-e of the negative suffix is colored to -o by the imperative suffix -u.
(16) daxw- day breaks, -I-'ok subordinating suffix (cf. 66).
""when day breaks, morning comes"" idiom for ""tomorrow"".
(17) da-- postposition, with (cf. 48), he-cogyaw- to fight (intransitive), and -a-ha'a, intentive suffix (cf. 60). he-cogyaw- is unexplainable but may be connected with cogo- to put away, and cognato own.
(18) galdei outside, plus the noun suffix for the dative, galdei may
also be used adjectivally.
(19) ha-dxil-na- one person goes out, cf. note 9 and section 34.
(20) This modal form — if it is a modal form — is unique. The
suffix -you appears in no other connection: here it seems to subordinate the expression ""he will fight with him"" to the following
""he says"". Thus the sentence reads, ""Coxote says that he will
fight with him"".
(21) no - to say, plus -n-, continuative suffix, and -a'a, assertive
suffix (cf. 56).
(22) yalxilna- to run away, plus the negative suffix -abe and the
imperative suffix -u. Note here, as in note 15, that the final -e of the
negative suffix becomes -o before the -u of the imperative.
(23) One of the more interesting Tonkawa compounds: ya-djeto see, look, plus xw'e-la- to miss (e. g. a mark when shooting). The
combination is invariably found with the negative suffix and thus
forms the verb ""to not miss seeing . . . "" , i. e., ""to watch closely"".
That it is a true compound is seen here by the position of the first
person pronoun ge- between the two themes (cf. 36). Note here, too,
the vocalic coloring of the final vowel of the negative suffix -abe
(cf. notes 15, 22).",[153]
"The position of the second person object suffix varies in relation
to other theme suffixes. Normally, it follows the f u t u r e tense suffix
-a-do- a n d t h e order is a follows:
Theme — F u t . — 2d. pers. — Contin. — Mode —
But
when t h e negative suffix -abe- is added to t h e theme, the order
becomes:
Theme — 2d pers. — Neg. — F u t . — Contin. — Mode —

The pronoun object may also be interpreted as the subject of the
action and such an interpretation gives a slightly different connotation to the verb. For example, t'ca-b-o'c I hide (intr.), becomes
ge-t'cab-o' I hide him, where ge- is the subject and the form really
means "" I act as a hiding place for him, I hide him by standing before
him"". Or, hedjn-o'c I lie down, as contrasted with g-e-djn-o' I fall
down, i. e., I lie down involuntarily, stumble and fall. I n general,
then, the interpretation of the object as subject gives a sort of
passive significance to the action: the subject being acted upon by
forces beyond its control. Further examples of these alternations
follow.

meaning of the form depends upon the context in which it is used.

visible, he- reflexive pronoun; -yadje- to see, look at . . . . Here, the
form heyadje-noklakno'o may also be translated ""made itself visible,
came into view"".","[79, 80]"
"Note, here, t h a t the pronominal prefixes merge with hec-, forming
ge-c- and we~c-. The change in meaning is curious: hec-ego'c is
literally: I cause him to give it to me, where the notion ""to m e "" is
probably due to he-; ge-c'ego he causes me to give it to him, where
ge- refers to "" m e "" and he- adds the notion ""to him"".
ge'c-doxwnono'I am smelling it; it makes its smell
known to me (doxwnono' I am

hec-da'ana'we'

you . . .
I pick it upThe meaning of the example, ge-c-da'ano' is, literally: it causes me
to pick it up, i. e., it is made possible for me to secure it, or: I am
able to get it. A text form: gex-da'anbeno' I cannot reach it, having
the negative suffix (cf. 53), illustrates this meaning.",[89]
"Only in the third person plural does the full form of the suffix
appear but note that the same type of contraction (-nwa~- from
-nwa'a) occurs in this paradigm as in that for the assertive. Note,
too, that the second person pronominal form is the same here as
for the assertive. These points of similarity are the only bases for
our placing this as a declarative-assertive mode. The initial -n
element of the suffix cannot be isolated.
All except one of the following text examples have the future
tense suffix.

oftenest in the future tense to define an action to take place at
some definite point in the future. In all of the examples the time is
definitely specified either by a word like ""tomorrow"" or by defining
it in terms of an immediately preceding or concurrent action.",[98]
"682HOIJER TONKAWAFinally, there are two other verb suffixes not illustrated in these
schemes. They are the -n suffix forming infinitives (cf. 73), and a
suffix -an changing a verb to a noun (cf. 75).
53. The Negative Suffix.
The negative of any verb may be formed by adding the suffix
-abe- directly to the theme. When, however, the verb takes the
second person object, this suffix is inserted between the theme and
the negative suffix (cf. 41). The order is, then, as follows:
Theme — Second Person Object — Negative — . . .
The initial -a- of the suffix, when added directly to the theme,
obscures the form of the final theme element causing its vowel to be
-a- in either the full or reduced form.
yagb-ab-o'c
geigab-ab-o'
yagb-abe-no'c
yagb-abe-nec'o'cI do not hit him
he does not hit me
I am not hitting him
we two do not hit himWhen the verb takes the second person object, the vowel -a- of the
suffix is lengthened.

yagba-be-no'c
weigaba'be-no'c
yagb&be-nec'o'cI do not hit you
I am not hitting you
I am not hitting you people
we two do not hit youI t is probable t h a t -abe- is an incorporated form of the adverb
gabai not, nothing, though no such relationship can be proven.
54. The Mode-less Paradigm.
I n its simplest form, this paradigm is not only modeless b u t
tense-less as well. I t is formed by adding the subject pronouns
directly to the theme and is found only in the first person singular,
dual, and plural.

Before entering upon the explanation of vocalic elision — the
most important single phonetic alternation affecting the theme —
it will be necessary to define more accurately the various types of
theme elements. We have already called attention to the fact that
there are two main types — the simple and the complex. The
simple element is composed of consonant plus vowel; the complex
element, generally built up of consonant plus vowel plus consonant,
has several types. In the following list of types of theme elements,
C is to be read as any consonant and V as any vowel. The lowerHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES5case letters refer to specific consonants and vowels and a period
after a letter indicates length.
Simple: CV
Complex: CVw

C'V-cv-cThe first two types of complex element (CVw and CVy) may, under
certain conditions, appear in the form Co• (cf. 10). They are found
only in the final theme position; i.e., directly before the first suffix
position. The others, for the most part, occur only in positions
other than the final though there are a few cases of a type CVC
element in the last position. In the examples that follow, the
complex elements are set in black faced type.

elements is the law of vocalic elision. According to this rule, simple
elements vary in form according to their position in the word. Those
elements in odd numbered positions (i. e., first, third, fifth, etc.)
have the full form (CV), and those in even numbered positions are
reduced (C~). Complex elements of types CV', CV'C, C'V"", and
C'V'C, in the even numbered position, reduce the length of their
vowels, becoming CV, CVC, C'V, C'VC, respectively. The complex
elements CVw and CVy have the same form in both positions even
when they have contracted to Co\ The remaining types (CVC,
C'V, and C'VC) have the same form in both positions. In the
following paragraphs the law will be considered in its application to
each type of element and examples of its workings will be given.","[13, 14, 15]"
"56. The Assertive Mode.
The suffix for the assertive has either the form -a'a (which is
probably its full form) or -a• (in which the second element has been
totally elided, (cf. 8). This suffix may be used in three different
ways, viz.,
Theme — Negative — Future tense — Dual or plural — Continuative — Assertive — Pronoun.
Theme — Negative — Continuative — Assertive.
Theme — First person pronoun — Assertive.",[96]
"HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN I N D I A NLANGUAGES6137. Theme Reduplication.
Reduplication serves two purposes in Tonkawa: first and most
often, it indicates repetitive action, and, secondly, it may indicate
t h a t many persons are engaged in a particular action. Thus:
hebag -o'c
hebahag -o'c
namaig -o'c
namamaig -o'cI tell, inform him
I inform him several times
I whirl it about my head
several whirl things about their headsI n rare cases, reduplication serves to intensify the act as in walahato boil (intr.), walalaba- to boil vigorously. Additional examples of
these functions will be found in the lists below.
I t is evident, from the examples given in the preceding sections,
t h a t the whole theme is very rarely repeated in the reduplicated
form. Generally, only one element of the theme is repeated and,
in this section, we shall attempt to classify themes according to the
element repeated — coordinating this classification with our
earlier classification (cf. 26) of themes according to structure.
i. Two Element Themes.
These reduplicate very consistently in the same manner: the
first position element is repeated and has the repeated form CVCV
— this, whatever the phonetic form of the element may be. In the
following list, the reduplicated forms are to be interpreted as
repetitive forms of the verb unless otherwise stated.

(Reduplicated form: several swim away)Note, in the last two examples, that the repeated form preserves the
length of the vowel.
(Reduplicated form: to be very angry)62HOIJER TONKAWAThere are but two exceptions to this rule — i. e., that the first
element of two element themes is repeated in the reduplicated
f o r m s : bile-,-ble-, bilele-t o roll, w r a p...u p ; a n d hexa-,-e~ca-,hexaca- to point to . . . These reduplicate the second element of the
complex.
ii. Three Element Themes.
These vary considerably in form. A majority of them — particularly those having a simple element in the first position — repeat
the second element of the complex and the repeated element has
the form CVCY.

yalba-, -ilah-, yalalabato stand . . . upThis list, it will be noted, contains all the ne- and na- themes and
quite a few ya- themes. Just as many ya- themes, however, repeat
the ya- in the reduplicated form and it has the form yai-.

complex in the reduplicated form but differ from those in the first
list in that the repeated element has the form CVC. Note that this
list contains three ya- themes.

the type CVC in the first position repeat this element in the reduplicated form.

iii. Miscellaneous.
There are a number of four element themes which repeat the
second element (form CVC) when reduplicated.

yacyag'e-, -yacyag'e-, yacecyag'eto tear, rip . . .
yalxilna-, -yalxilna-, yalalxilnato runThemes having nec- or hec- as the first element repeat these elements
in the form necec- or hecec, respectively, when reduplicated:
hec'ege-, hecec'ege-to ask for .. .necgaba-,nececgaba-to shut (door, window)neclaxge-,nececlaxge-to cough, splutter, clear one's throatnecgwide-, nececgwide-to tie ... up; fasten . . .iv. Conclusions.
The fact that only one element of a theme is repeated and that,
in different classes of themes, varying elements are the repeated
ones, seems to imply that elements of a certain type must be
repeated in reduplicated forms. But, it is impossible to say whether
this variation is due simply to phonetic circumstance or if it is
because of the functions of the elements. There is no evidence for
either position. It may be significant that first position elements64HOIJER TONKAWAare generally repeated except when these are na-, ne-, ha-, he-, and
ya- (here again an exception must be made of ya- themes which
reduplicate the ya- element). In these last cases, the second position
element is the one repeated. However, our evidence for theme
analysis does not permit of any generalizations as to the functions
of most theme elements and, though this fact of reduplication may
be signficant, there appears to be no way of applying it to the
problem of theme structure.
38. Auxiliary Themes and Particles.
There are three auxiliary themes in Tonkawa, -ye--, -em- to be;
-we- to be (as the result of having become), to become; -ei-, -Vto be (in a certain place), to do. We have seen, in the discussion of
final theme elements, that there may have been others but these
three are the only ones now freely used — i. e., not permanently a
part of any particular theme or group of themes, (cf. 34).
i. -ye'-,-e- t o be,This theme has the form -ye-- when attached to themes which can
stand alone — i. e., which need no formal suffixes to complete their
meaning (themes functioning as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs)
and the form -e~- when used with verb themes. Thus:
hocac-ye'to be young (hocac young)
xalal-ye'to be hot, have a fever (xalal
wixwan-ye'to be small (wixwan small)
h a "" ' a g o ' n - y e t o be a man (hcr'ago'n man)
hedjn-e'yel-e~heilab-e'hendoc-e--hot)to be lying down (hedjne- to lie down)
to be sitting (yela- to sit down)
to be standing (heilaba- to stand up)
several are standing (hendoc- several
stand, stop moving)Note that the combination of active verb and the auxiliary -e~gives a static significance to the expression.
ii. -we- to be, become.
This auxiliary is also used with themes functioning as adjectives
and adverbs but differs in meaning in that it defines a static condition resulting from preceding activity. Thus, go-c'a-we- to be old,
have become old, is a possible form but hocac-we- is impossible since
one cannot become younger.
-we- added to noun themes has the function of verbifying those
themes and the resulting verb may either be active or static. Thus:
V'a
'o""'a-we-night
to be night, night fallsHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES65daxac
daxce-we-day
day breaksneiganak
neiganak-we-first
to be first, to come in first (in a race)yo'ts
yo'dz-we-foam
to foam, bubblewe- is not added to verb themes.
iii. -'ei-, - V - to be (in a certain place), to do.
This auxiliary is used with all forms as is -ye-- but differs in that
the meaning of the resulting combination may be active as well as
static. Thus, m'e-ldjidjen sheet lightning, plus - V - becomes m'e-ldjidjen-'e-- sheet lightning plays, flashes. The variation in form
between -'ei- and - V - is phonetic (cf. 8).
The meaning ""to be"" of -'ei- emphasizes locality rather than
quality as in the case of -ye--. Contrast, for example, yel-e-- to be
sitting, where the emphasis is on the fact of a person sitting and
having been seated for a long time, with yel-'ei- to be sitting there,
the emphasis being on the position of the person concerned. This
difference is very neatly brought out in the following pair of text
forms: heilaban-t'cel-'a-y'ik (at the top of the tree), yel-e--laklakno'o
he was sitting, it is said, at the top of the tree, as contrasted with
da--yel-'e--noklakno'o he was sitting there with her, it is said. In the
last form no location is specified, the auxiliary placing the action.
A peculiar usage of -'ei- is illustrated in the following two themes:
yax- ei'a'x-'ei-to be hungry (yaxa- to eat)
to be thirsty ('a-x water)Here the auxiliary appears to imply desire, thus: 'a-x-'ei- to want
water, be thirsty, yax-'ei- to want to eat, be hungry. There are no
other examples of this usage.
Tonkawa particles are all formed by the addition of various
conjunctive, subordinating and participial suffixes (cf. 64) to a
theme much resembling the auxiliary -'ei-.

"The above increase in intensity from hemayan, a fairly mild oath,
to hemayan gadau cilwan, which is the very acme of profanity. The
same series may be gone through, substituting 'egwan dog, for the
word ""ghost""; or 'ix evil, for ""ghost""; and, finally, 'idjxic, a word
of no meaning. These are not so seriously taken: to swear by the
ghost is the most profane.

Both continuative and non-continuative forms of the present

The past tense of the declarative mode is formed by a suffix -'ei,
having the same position as the present tense suffix. The final -i of
the tense suffix appears only in the second person subject forms;
in all other cases, the suffix -ei has been reduced to-'e. The -o- color
of the suffix is due t o the influence of the preceding mode suffix (cf. 3).
The paradigm is as follows:

This tense form is supplied by inserting the future tense suffix
n the paradigms for the past tense. Thus,
harn-a'dew-o'o'ha'n-a'do-n-o'o•-'I will go away
I am going to go awayI t defines an action to take place some time in the future beyond
the present time — from tomorrow on to infinity. Unfortunately,
it does not occur in any of my texts — the above forms were
obtained from the informant by direct questioning. In spite of this,
the form is probably valid, and the meaning given above fits nicely
into the Tonkawa tense system.","[94, 95, 96]"
"In this case, the elements -ge and -dje are quite clearly added to an
original theme da'ane- and the meaning definitely changed. These54HOIJER TONKAWAare, however, isolated cases. From the manner in which they are
added to the theme (i. e., they are added to the final form of the
theme, da'an-, as contrasted to the form of the theme, da'ane-,
to which the auxiliary -ye~- ""to be"" is added) it is possible that -ge
and -dje are reduced forms of old themes existing only in composition
with da'an-.
hexwehexcacahe-exexca""-yew-a noise is heard; there is a noise
to yelp, yell, give a cry
several persons scream-we is probably cognate with the auxiliary -we- to be; therefore hexmay be assumed to mean ""a noise"", -coca appears to be a reduplicated element since, in the third form, it appears as -ca (its length is
due to the influence of the following reciprocal suffix -yew, cf. 46).
-ca may, then, be an element of the type of -'e, -'a, etc., a verbalizer
adding, at the same time, a momentaneous connotation. Thus,
hex-caca- to (utter) sharp noises repeatedly, to yelp (as a dog). Our
evidence is limited to this one form and the analysis must, therefore,
be judged accordingly.
yagoca-, -igocayagodja-, -igodja-to whistle
to screamThese forms, if comparable, show a nice alternation between two
elements, -ca and -dja, which appears to modify the action derivationally. No further evidence is available and even a tentative
explanation is hardly possible on the basis of these two forms.
ha'dj-ida
ha'djidj-ai
ha'djxa-both of them (cf. 86 for -'ida)
both sides (cf. 87 for -ai)
two persons ride (on a horse); several
ride, two (on a horse)This appears to be a clear case of composition: ha~dj- both, two,
plus -xa to ride (on a horse). An interesting comparison is found in
word 'egwan-c-xau horse, which appears to be a compound of
'egwan dog, -c noun instrumental, (cf. 86), and -xau. If the -xa of
-xau is cognate with the -xa above, 'egwancxau would mean,
literally, ""dog used for riding"".

"84. The Theme.
I t will be remembered that the verb theme, though fixed and
rigid in form, was in some cases analyzable into stem and stem
affixes. Themes functioning as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs may
also be so analyzed and, in the following lists, we have arranged
these themes according to the character of their first position

can readily see t h a t we have not succeeded in penetrating deeply
into t h e structure. Quite obviously, however, there are not m a n y
differences between these themes and verb themes and, perhaps,
if we could be more definite in our analysis of the verbs, the nouns
and others would not be so unyielding t o analysis.
There are only a very few themes having separate plural forms:
plurality is normally t a k e n care of by suffixation (cf. 86).

plural form. I t will also be noted t h a t this reduplication is accompanied by a ""breaking"" of the vowel of another theme element —
i. e., t h e insertion, it seems, of an element composed of glottal stop
plus vowel. This process is unique with these forms.","[117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"
"These noun suffixes may also be added to third person forms of
the verb and, in such an event, are translated as an agentive,
''the one who does so and so"". Examples:
neiganak xamxano1 - a""-la the one arriving first (xa'xa-n-o' he is arriving)
,a%x-wa'-,a'-l-cogano,-,am-la
the one owning the waters (coga-n-o' he is

the one who cuts through to the other end
dodobo-k-lakno'o yaweno'-'a'-lak
she cut that b y which he was tied
(yawe-n-o' he is being tied)Note, in the above examples, that agentive forms always require
the noun suffix for the definite.
There are also a few examples of noun suffixes attached to verb
themes: such constructions are generally interpreted as subordinated
forms.",[124]
"Note especially the cases in which -e makes a verbal form of a noun
form; viz., yadin- e- to scrape... from yadin scraper, and bal'il-eto smear . . . with brains, medicine, from bal'il brains. These
alternations seem to confirm the theory that -'e serves as a verbalizer, activizing nominal themes. This fact cannot be proved from the
rest of the themes concerned.
There are no conclusive test forms for the -'a element. The
contrast between yadjoxo- to cover . . . with blanket, yadjox'o- to
build a tipi, and yadjox'aw- to build a tipi, suggests that - a may
have a function similar to that of -e (-o is probably -'a colored to
-'o by vocalic harmony with the preceding vowel. The difference
between yadjox'aw- and yadjox'o- does not come out in the meanings
of the two). Since yadjoxo- means ""to cover... with a blanket"",
yadjox'o- may be translated ""to do, make a covering of blankets,
skins"", i. e., to build a tipi.
Another alternation worthy of notice is that between gel-neto be drowned and ne-gel-'e- to drown.... Here is introduced an
element -ne which appears, in this case, to characterize a neuter
theme. Only one other test form is available.
m'e'lnem'e-ldjidjen-,e'-(light) shines, glares; (sun) is shining
there is sheet lightning; lightning
playsThe second form is obviously an old compound: mVZ- plus -djidjenplus -'&•-. Of these, -V- alone is definable. I t is the auxiliary verb
theme to be (cf. 38). m'e-l-djidjen can exist alone and is defined as a
noun: sheet lightning, m'e-l-, therefore, appears to be definable as a
glowing, a shining, but there is no evidence for a definition of
-djidjen. -ne appears to have the same function here as in the
preceding example.",[60]
"Note, in the third person plural, t h a t -n replaces -k. The -n so
substituted is probably cognate with the infinitive -n\ i. e., the
infinitive is used idiomatically in the third person plural.
-k forms may be used alone, with noun suffixes, or as bases for
the modal enclitics. The last named will be discussed in the section
following. The first two usages have a variety of functions, for
example:
hexaVoi hw'ac 'e'nok genana'djo'nogwa there are many ants biting me,
hexaVoi ants, ha""'ac many, and V - , auxiliary to be, plus -no con-HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES101tinuative a n d t h e -k suffix seem to form t h e subject of the sentence

t h e following e x a m p l e :yadjox'an-e'e'k na-'e'-no-k xai-'an'ok we'bag-o'c'o-u go to camp; when you
arrive, tell them, in which the -k form (na""'e'-no-k)
a verb.is used simply asThese are the only two examples of -k forms used alone. In all
the others, it has some noun case suffix attached and functions
either in a subordinate sense or as a verbal noun.
xa'xa-k-la ""haglana-d banxo-u"" noklakno'o when he arrived (or, he having
arrived), t h e y said "" G o down and t a k e a b a t h "" , it is said. I n this example,
one can t a k e a choice of interpretations — translating rca'cra-Ma
either as ""when he a r r i v e d "" or as t h e subject of t h e s e n t e n c e "" h e , having
arrived, (was told 'Go down a n d t a k e a b a t h ' ) "" . T h e l a t t e r is
probably t h e b e t t e r ; -la, as we shall see later (cf. 86), defines t h e
nominative case.""gwa'lo'dak-la nadje-u"" no-co-k-la nadje-k-la 'eigan-aidjo-no'c ""big one,
bite,"" Itoldhim: whenhebitldraggedhimup.Thisexampleillustrates
t h e subordinating function of t h e -k form.","[110, 111]"
"Here we have a clear distinction between a neuter intransitive verb
and an active transitive verb. It may be well to remark, however,
that this is but an isolated example — no such verbal distinction
is generally recognized in theme forms. Nor is it possible, in this
particular case, to determine how much of this alternation has been
caused by the change from -ne to -e and how much is due to the
addition of ne-.The evidence with regard to -ne, -e alternations are
few but they do indicate that -ne is a characteristic of some — not
all — neuter verbs and that -e generally appears in an active theme.
The transitive signification is probably not due to ne- since it is used
with transitives and intransitives. The only conclusion is that necannot be defined from this set of forms.
ya-dicxene-dic'e-(e. g. a bull) butts . . .
to press, jab . . . (with finger)HANDBOOK O F AMERICAN INDIANLANGUAGES37In this case, too, we have an alternation of final theme elements
for which there is little definition possible (cf. 35). In view of this
fact, the ya-, ne- variation is not definable.
co"" yanaco'yadanenco'yawa-to swim off, away
to swim (towards the speaker)
to swim with a burden; to ferry . . .
across (e. g., to swim across holding a bundle of clothes out of the
water)In this case, two elements have been added, ne- and -n- and the
final elements of the themes are varied, -na and -da are clearly
definable as directives, the former referring to direction away from
the speaker, the latter to direction towards the speaker (cf. 34).
-wa appears to have a durative function — or, at least, appears in
a good many themes expressing repeated or long continued action
(cf. 45). -n- may be the reduced form of na- and ne- is evidently the
element we have been discussing. If na- is defined as an incorporated
object (cf. 28), ne- would appear to establish an oblique relationship between -co~yawa- and na-: thus, the complete analysis, newith, -n- an object, -ccryawa- to swim duratively.
The application of this analysis to other ne- themes requires, of
course, an analysis of the rest of the theme — a thing which is not
always possible. Thus: ne-gel-'e- could be analyzed: to do to . . . by
drowning — i. e., to d r o w n . . . — if we were sure that -e- could be
defined as an active transitive verbalizer — an element empty of
concrete significance but adding these more formal meanings to the
verb. This is not always possible (cf. 34).
Our conclusions with regard to the definition of ne-, then, must
be that its meaning cannot be deduced with accuracy without
knowing quite a bit about the rest of the theme. This knowledge
is not available for all themes: there are simply a few indications
as to their structure (cf. 39). But we can suggest that ne- has to do
with the relationship between theme elements — that ne- themes
are three element themes in which the second and third elements
are indirectly connected through ne-.
30. ya- Themes.
Themes having ya- as the first element are rather more numerous
than either of the two preceding groups, ya- is also a simple element
and has the reduplicated form yai-. This alone is unique; it will be
remembered that neither na- nor ne- were reduplicated. A number
of ya- themes repeat ya- in the reduplicated form; some repeat the
second element of the verb complex, and, for a few themes, both
types of reduplication are found. I t is not possible to place ya- with38HOIJER TONKAWArespect to ne- since they do not appear in the same themes. Nor are
there any test forms to show its relative position with respect

"The forms car-, na--, 'a--, geuca--, and wena-- are probably reduced
forms of the personal independent pronoun (cf. 90).
We have already discussed the possible relationship between the
he- element of he- themes (cf. 32) and the reflexive pronoun. We
noted t h a t the he- element had a position probably between that of
ha- and the pronominal prefixes: the he- reflexive seems to hold the
same position as the rest of the pronoun prefixes. I t is not possible,
however, to determine the absolute position of the he- reflexive with
reference to the other pronoun prefixes because the two kinds of72HOIJER TONKAWAelement do not appear in the same forms. Consequently, the only
formal difference between the two elements is that the he- element
is ""frozen"" to the theme while the he- reflexive is a movable theme
prefix. Wherefore our conclusion here must be the same as in
section 32: while the evidence does not disprove a relationship
between the he- element and the he- reflexive, neither does it prove
that the he- element is the reflexive pronoun ""frozen"" to the theme.
44. The Subjective Series.
The position of the subjective pronoun at the end of the verb
form has rendered it peculiarly susceptible to the processes of
phonetic decay. Added to this is the influence exerted upon these
forms by the neighboring modal suffixes. These forces have resulted
in the presence of eight distinct series of the subjective pronoun,
depending upon the particular paradigm considered. The suffixes
indicating number have not been affected and are the same for all
the series: viz., zero for the singular, -nee'- for the dual, and -wee'-,
-o-c'- for the plural. The following lists will indicate only the personal
forms: it is to be understood that the dual and plural can be made
up by adding the above mentioned suffixes. One exception to this
rule is the third person plural in those paradigms in which it exists.
These do not use the suffix -wee'-, -ox'-, but have special forms added
to the third person singular which will be listed.

"Used according to the second scheme, the theme plus the suffix
for the assertive is completed in meaning by the auxiliary -'ei-.
There are only two examples of this usage in the texts.

. . . plus continuative suffix -n plus t h e assertive. 'e~-, auxiliary, is
here used t o indicate desire (cf. 38) plus t h e continuative -no and
t h e quotative suffix -klakno'o (cf. 81).
yax-ah-a'a
'e'-n-o'c I have certainly not eaten (freely: I a m starving), yaxt o eat plus -abe, negative suffix, plus the assertive.",[97]
"HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIANLANGUAGES39There is the same difficulty with the test forms involving the
ya- element as we found in the case of the other two elements: they
are not sufficiently definitive. Take, for example, the following
comparison:
nec-digeya-dge-, -i -dig-to be cold, freezing
to be frozen stiff-dige- is not used alone but, since it appears with nee-, the causative
theme prefix (cf. 50), it can be defined ""to freeze, chill, be cold"".
But the use of ya- with the same theme does not alter the meaning
in a manner helpful to a definition of ya-.
gam,namwaya-ga'na'wa-to throw . . . with the hand (e. g. to
throw a ball, stick, etc.)
to swing (e. g. on a rope swing)In this example, it may be seen that ya- appears to establish a
relation between the other elements of the theme. If we assume the
complex -na-wa- to mean ""moving through space (as if thrown)""
and ga~- to refer to an act of propelling or throwing (perhaps related
to ga--na- to throw . . . away, and ga~-da- to throw . . . towards the
speaker, where -na and -da are the directives, cf. 34), then yawould appear to establish an instrumental relationship between the
second and third elements of the theme. Thus, the whole form would
have the meaning ""to move through space by reason of throwing
(pushing, some means of propulsion)"" or, ""to swing"". The case is
necessarily weak since we cannot offer any evidence for the meaning
of the second part of the theme complex.
yaxwdjeyaxw-nadjga-to strike . . . with a club
to beat . . . to death with a clubNotice, in this pair of forms, that the third theme element -dje is
dropped when the theme is compounded with -nadjga- to kill. That
seems to imply that ya-xw- means ""by means of a club"" and -dje
""to strike"". In other words, ya- establishes an instrumental relationship between -dje ""to strike"" and -xwe- (the full form of -xw-)
referring to a club or stick. Unfortunately, there is no further
evidence for this analysis.
In conclusion, then, we are left with the feeling that ya- is a
separable theme element possibly serving to establish a type of
relationship between the second and third elements of the theme
similar in form to that postulated for ne-, though, in neither case,
have we conclusive proof.
31. ha- Themes.
ha- represents an element of quite a different class from any of
the preceding — at least, as far as phonetic behavior is concerned.
In the first place, it precedes both na- and ya- in the verb complex40HOIJER TONKAWAand therefore, by implication, precedes ne- though there are no test
forms illustrating its use with ne- themes.
hangaba-hanangaba-(e. g., leeches) stick, are fastened
to . . . ; to be stuck, caught fast
(on some sticky substance)
several objects (e. g., leeches) stick
to . . . ; it holds several fastThese examples, quoted before in section 28, illustrate the use of
ha- with a na- theme. It will be remembered that, in this case, haseemed to indicate an indirect relationship between na- and gaba-;
that the form was tentatively analyzed as: an object (na-) is
fastened (-gaba-) to (ha-)....
Another curious phase of phonetic
behavior may be illustrated by this verb.
hangab -o'
ga-ngab -o'(leech) sticks t o him
(leech) sticks to m eNotice here that the addition of the single element theme prefix gedoes not reverse the forms of the theme elements: -n-, -ga-, and -bahave the same form in the second example as they had in the first.
ha-, of course, is absorbed to the preceding prefix ge-, giving ga~(cf. 8). This behavior is characteristic of all ha- themes composed of
more than three elements (including ha-) . Note the following:
habdjen -o'
ga'bdjen -o'it is full
I am full; I

ga'dxec -o'I know h i m ; a m acquainted with

are listed the ha- themes having a complex second element.","[48, 49, 50]"
"(33) I t is not clear how 'edcin'e functions in this sentence: formally,
having no case suffixes, it should have adverbial function as, indeed,
it does have at the end of line 2, page 287, but there is no verb
following unless we connect it with the preceding particle 'e-da.
(34) daxac sun, haglana-k, -k form of ha-gla-na- one person goes
down. Cf. note 29.
(35) 'adj-xawa- ('adjxo--) wind blows from the north; cold,
disagreeable wind blows. The analysis of this form is not so clear:
the element 'adj- appears to occur in ben-'ats spring (the meaning of
ben- is unknown), and in 'adj-'ix cold, disagreeable ('ix bad).
Perhaps 'adj- has reference to weather in a sense of disagreeable
weather and - xawa- refers to the blowing of the wind. This analysis
is purely speculative.
(36) Note the plural form of the noun gwa-n woman (cf. 84).
(37) noho-na'e--to go for wood,— an unanalyzable theme. Perhaps
compounded of noho-na-, which may be an old theme meaning
""wood"" and -V-, a form of the verb 'ei-na- to go off.
(38) we-l'ad he, that one (over there), cf. 91. 'ei-d- to come, plus
the modal suffix -e-l, cf. 63.
(39) xogoc refers to that part of the body above the waist; -'a-w'an
singular definite dative (towards) suffix.
(40) gec'adjan below the waist.
(41) caxwa- to run away, — also means 'to be frightened'.

"The above themes are composed of three simple elements.
The next group of three element themes are characterized by a
complex first position element.

to rub tr.
to skin, flay tr.
to become dark
to build a fence tr.
to put on pants
to like, love tr.
to be choking
to discharge windThe first set of themes above is notable in that there appears to be
a definite distinction in function between the first theme element
and the second two. Compare, for example,
dol-'axegai-'axecorn-'axe-to shell corn
to cut . . . at the joint
to skinall having to do with cutting or breaking. Perhaps the combination
-'axe- means 'to cut, break off', and the first position elements refer
to the objects of the action, thus: dol- 'corn', gai- 'a joint', and
com- 'a skin'. We shall refer to this analysis again in sections
35 and 36.
Finally, there are a few themes composed of two complex elements
plus a simple element.
x ac age-, -x ac age-,
ya'lo'na-, -yalo'na-,
xa'weida-, -xa'weida-,
bal'il'e-, -bal'iVexaidelxaxaidibdje-, -xaidibdje-,

yalalxilna-to scratch tr.
to kill tr.
to turn around intr.
to rub (e. g. brains on skin) tr.
to come up (in water after a dive)
several fall down
to run awayThese, then, are the major forms of the themes of class one — the
prefix-less themes. It may be significant that reduplicated formsHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES33rather consistently repeat only a certain one of the theme elements
— generally the first. This fact gains in importance when viewed
in the light of the tentative analysis made on the preceding page.
Here, we noted that the second part of the theme seemed to supply
the verbal connotation and the first appeared to be an incorporated
object — or, at least, a class indicator (i. e., a prefix limiting the
object of the verb to a certain class of noun). In the reduplicated
form, this ""class indicator"" was the repeated element. However,
there is no way of generalizing this tendency — the majority of
themes cannot be analyzed in this way.28. na- Themes
The themes in this class all have an element na- in the first
position. It will be seen that this is a simple element (i. e., its vowel
is elided when the theme is preceded by a single element prefix)
and that these themes repeat the second element of the complex
in the reduplicated form.

nadgo-, -ndog-,
hangab-, -angaba-, hanangab-several lie down intr.

either the meaning or function of na-. There are, however, three
examples of theme variation involving this element.

the order of their appearance in the verb, is given below.
ge- first person object pronoun
we- third person plural object pronoun
geu- first person plural object pronoun
nec- causative
da - to, with
ya- causative
xa-, x- to a distance, with force
These will be discussed in detail and examples of their use given in
sections 47—51.
The theme suffixes are much more numerous and express all
ideas of tense, mode, person (except for the three object pronouns
prefixed), and number. I n general, they have the following order.
Theme
Negative suffix
Future tense suffix
Second person object pronoun (singular)
Number suffixes (subject only)
Continuative suffix
Tense and mode suffixes
Subjective pronouns
There are minor exceptions to this order; these details and others
will be discussed in section 52.
I t is apparent from this classification t h a t our study of the
Tonkawa verb will fall rather neatly into two parts: the theme, and
the theme affixes. The first is to deal with the few variations
undergone by verb themes and to establish, if possible, the rules
governing its structure and manipulation. In the second part — the
study of theme affixes — the grammatical and syntactical variations of the verb form will be discussed.a . THE V E E B THEME ( 2 639)26. Types of Verb Theme.
Tonkawa verb themes may be divided, roughly, into two classes
— two element themes (i. e., themes composed of two phonetic
elements, cf. 5), and three element themes. The latter class may be
sub-divided, however, according to the character of the first position
element. That is, certain elements (na-, ne-, ya-, ha-, and he-)
appear consistently as the first elements in so many of these themes
t h a t they may be considered as prefixes. The themal types are,HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES29then: two element themes, three element themes (placing here those
three element themes not containing any of the above ""prefixes""),
na- themes, ne- themes, ya- themes, ha- themes, and he- themes.
Finally, there are a number of two and three element themes which
always appear with certain theme prefixes (nec-, hec-, ya-, and
da--). In these cases, the theme prefixes have become so much a
part of the theme that it cannot be used without them. The whole
classification may, then, be summarized in the following manner.
1. Prefix-less Themes;
a. Two element themes.
b. Three element themes.
2. Themes whose first elements appear to be old prefixes.
a. na- themes.
b. ne- themes.
c. ya- themes.
d. ha- themes.
e. he- themes.
3. Themes requiring theme prefixes to complete their meanings.
a. ya- themes.
b. nec- themes, (hec- themes are a sub-division of this group)
c. da•- themes.","[37, 38, 39]"
"HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIANLANGUAGES3529. ne- Themes.
The element ne- is similar to na- in phonetic structure — t h a t is,
it is a simple element •— but it seems to have a different position
in the verb theme. This point is illustrated by only one example:
na-m'ene-to broil . . .ne-n -m'ene-to roast, barbecue . . .but there are a number of themes similar in structure to the second
form above. For none of these, however, are the primary forms
(i. e., those without ne- similar to nam'ene-, above) available, nereis not to be interpreted as a reduplicated form of ne- because, as
will be seen from the subjoined list, the reduplicated forms of nethemes repeat the second element of the complex.

vowel in the reduced form of the theme. This is probably because,
if it did, the elision of the vowel would result in the total elision of
the element — i. e., the two consonants n would come together.
Such combinations are avoided in Tonkawa.
3*36HOIJERTONKAWAThere are quite a number of test cases involving ne- but we shall
see that they help very little in defining the element.

"In this set of examples, the nec- of the first form is the causative
theme prefix (cf. 50): the form can, then, be translated 'to cause...
to be shut, closed, fastened', whereupon the meaning 'to be closed,
shut, fastened' can be attributed to -gaba-. hangaba- is conjugated
as follows:

clothes, etc.), and nedjlegwe-, -nedjlegwe- to wash (a blanket, clothes),
seem to have the complex element nedj- in common. I t may be that
these two verbs are old compounds but note t h a t the pronouns come
before the whole complex in each case and not between the two
elements of the theme.
ha'nadjidjxile-yandjidjxileyalxilnaya'ncxile-several persons run awayto run away
to run away
to runI n these forms, all meaning practically the same thing, we notice
the element -xile- as the only complex common to all four themes.
I t may be t h a t it is an old theme referring to direction which has
become fused to these themes expressing running. There is, however,
no way of proving this analysis.

to shell cornI n this set of themes, all have an element of the type CVC in the
first position and the complex -'axe- in the second two positions.
Notice, too, t h a t there is enough similarity in meaning to postulate
a relationship between them. I t is quite possible that - axe- refers
to breaking in a general sense and t h a t the first position elements
refine this concept to suit the particular occasion. Thus, gai- may
refer to cutting or chopping and we find it again in the theme,
'ei-gaidje-, 'ei-gagaidje- to c h o p . . . ; c u t . . . with an axe. In the same
way, the other first position elements may serve to refine the
meaning of the general complex -'axe- though we cannot adduce
any proof of this. I n short, it is a possible hypothesis t h a t these
themes are old compounds of smaller morphologic units which once
had a greater variability.
To conclude, then, the evidence presented in this section has
indicated t h a t the origins of some themes at least may be due to
compounds formed in an earlier period in the history of the language.
In preceding sections, other material has suggested that the theme,
though now indivisible, may have been, at one time, a combination
of elements each having certain definite functions and I think that
the indications presented in this section strengthen t h a t hypothesis
somewhat. I t is evident, however, that we shall not be able to prove
conclusively that such a process has occurred: that would require
either historical material or comparative material from languages
related to Tonkawa and both of these aids are lacking.","[69, 70]"
"HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES51Finally, there are a number of verb themes formed by adding a
-wa element to a noun theme. These themes seem to be of the same
type as those having -e, -a, and -ne verbifiers. The difference, of
course, lies in the fact that in most of the latter cases the noun
theme back of the verb has not been retained in active usage —
has lost its independent existence. For the themes we are about to
list, we have, in each case, the noun themes.

yo'dj-wa-foam (as from soap or on beer)
(water, beer) foamsThe same sort of alternation between noun and verb theme may
be accomplished by adding the auxiliary verb theme -we- to a noun
theme. For example, calal tears, becomes calal-we- to be in tears, to
weep, by the addition of the auxiliary -we-. This fact leads to the
belief that -'e, -a, -ne, -na, -da and -wa exemplify old auxiliaries
which have, in the process of theme petrification, lost independent
status. Any noun theme of present day Tonkawa can be verbified
by one or other of the three auxiliaries still possessing independent
status, -V-, -ye'-, or -we- (cf. 38). We have seen that -na and -da
alternate with -e and -'a; that -ne alternates with -e and that -wa
appears to perform essentially the same function as -e and -'a.
For these reasons, it appears likely that a good many verb themes
can be explained as having been formed by the addition of a verbifier to an old noun theme. These old noun themes have gone out of
existence (as nouns) probably because nouns are today formed by
adding a suffix to the verb theme (cf. 75). The themes listed below
are those which seem to agree formally with the test forms for
-e, -'a, -ne, and -wa above (the -na and -da themes have already
4*52HOIJER TONKA WAbeen given). There is no proof that they have been formed in this
way but their very numbers add weight to our interpretation.

verbs by simply adding formal verb suffixes.

preceding enclitics: it is found oftener with -k forms. It is probable,
however, that it, too, is an old auxiliary which has lost independent
status and is now confined to forms such as these.
80. The Hortatory - V .
This enclitic may only be added to verbs. It is never used in
conjunction with the suffix for the future tense or with the continuative suffix. Examples:
dana-ce-k-'e• let's go!
daixena-ce-k-'e•let's go across!t'celai-de'-la xawan-a'do-no-gwa geda'ble-u yagex-aidjona-ce-k-'e• the sky isgoing to fall; help me, let's push it up!

geda'ble-u ma""dan ya'lo'na-ce-k-'e• help me, let's kill him quickly
daclo'-ce-k-'e• let's go wandering81. The Quotative Suffixes, -no'o and -lakno'o.
Both of these suffixes can only be added to the verb form in -k.
The first of them, -no'o, means ""it is being said . . . "" or ""one hears
that . . . "" . Examples:
djane-ne-k-no'o it is being said that you left her
ya'lo'na-k-no'o it is said that he killed himwe'-y'ik gwa'n-la hedjodjxo'-k-la 'eiwendjaga-no-k-no'o it is said that over
there (is) a bad woman (who) habitually kills people
'eigagaidj-a'do-k-no'o he says it will be cutThe suffix -lakno'o is used by a speaker when telling myths and
indicates that the events recounted happened a long time ago. It is
really a narrative form and must be added to every verb in a story
except those employed in direct discourse within the story.
Examples:106HOIJERTONKAWAda'yadjox'o-no-k-lakno'o
he lived with her, it is said
hébaixwedan-la xa'xa-k-lalcnó'o a woman arrived, it is said'""egwan bax yaxa-n-o'o'-' "" no-k-lakno'o ""I eat only dogs"" she said, it is
saidFor other examples of narrative forms cf. Chapter I I I , Text
Analysis.
The -no'o in both suffixes is probably the third person form of the
declarative past of the theme new- to say, tell. The -laic of the
narrative suffix is probably cognate with the accusative suffix of the
noun. Therefore, the quotative may be translated as ""they have
said t h a t . . . "", while the narrative form would be ""they told of . . . "".
82. The Subordinating Enclitics.
These are three in number: -a-lagid because, -ai as, while, and
-ladoi but, except. They may only be added to the verb form in -k
and are not commonly used in the texts.

"C. SYLLABIFICATION AND ACCENT (19)19. Syllabification and Accent.
Each syllable of aTonkawa word must begin with a consonant
and, if possible, be composed of consonant plus vowel plus consonant. Where there is a series of sounds of the type CVGVG, the
first syllable will be CV, the second, GVC. Examples of syllabification:
ne-bax-gan
ne-bax-go'-ctobacco
I smokeyad-co'-c
gei-da-co'I stab him
he stabs meIf the vowel of a syllable be long, it need not be completed by a
consonant.
ya'-djo'-c
ge-ya-djo'I see him
he sees m eya'-be-djo'-cI make clothes22HOIJER TONKAWAIf, however, an element containing a long vowel be followed by a
consonant plus consonant, the first consonant must be included in
the first syllable. Thus :

I scratch itIn all of the preceding examples, it will be noted that a final
consonant may comprise a syllable.
Accent in Tonkawa is evenly distributed — each syllable receives
substantially the same accentuation. Occasionally, however, a
slightly heavier accent may be noted for the penult. Neither syllabification nor accent seem to have any effect upon the phonology of
the word nor are any morphological distinctions entirely dependent
upon them.","[31, 32]"

The Tonkawa appear to have been an important and warlike
tribe living in central Texas during most of the 18th and 19th
centuries. From the scanty accounts of their culture which have
come down to us through mission and governmental reports, they
were a nomadic people living on the buffalo. Their myths and
stories, of which I have collected about thirty, give indications
of their dependence upon buffalo and deer, and, insofar as this sort
of evidence is reliable, indicate a Plains type of culture. A more
complete account of their culture — or, rather, of what little is
known of their ethnological relations — may be found in the Handbook of the American Indian, B. A. E. Bulletin 30, part 2, under
the heading ""Tonkawa"".
The name ""Tonkawa"" is supposed by Gatschet to be derived
from a Waco word tonkaweya meaning ""they will stay together.""
I am unable to verify or disprove this etymology. The Tonkawa call
themselves didjganwa-didj, which may be translated as ""the
people.""
Powell, in his linguistic classification, considered t h a t the Tonkawa
language formed an independent linguistic stock, i. e., was unrelated
to any other American Indian language. Certain lesser tribes — the
Yojuane, Mayeye, and Ervipianne — were certainly associated in
culture and may have spoken languages related to Tonkawa. I have
not had access to the material extant on these languages. Certain
other small tribes, notably the Sana (sometimes written Zana and
Chana), situated between the Tonkawa and the Coahuiltecan
speaking groups, may also have spoken a language related to
Tonkawa. Only fragmentary material on Sana is extant. Relationship between Tonkawa and the Coahuiltecan languages has been
postulated: the difficulty of proving any such relationship lies in
the scarcity of material on the Coahuiltecan languages, a difficulty
that cannot, unfortunately, be remedied since these languages are
now extinct.
The language groups mentioned above are probably the closest
to Tonkawa. There is also a possibility that it is very distantly
related to languages of the so-called Hokan group. I have not had
the opportunity of making an adequate investigation of this
possibility. So far as this work is concerned, then, it will.be necessary
to consider Tonkawa as an independent language: as one for which
no cognates have been proven.","[7, 8, 9]"
"27. The Two and Three Element Themes.
In this section we shall list examples of the two and three element
themes (excluding, of course, those three element themes requiring
prefixes of any sort). These will be presented in order of increasing
complexity with the simplest types first. Whenever possible, three
forms will be given for each theme; the full form (i. e., the theme not
preceded by a theme affix), the reduced form (its form when preceded by a single element theme prefix, cf. 5), and the reduplicated
form.

The glottal stop of the present can be heard clearly in slow speech:

Text examples: (there are, unfortunately, no text examples of the
future tense of this interrogative form).

In the singular form, the initial glottal stop of the tense suffix has
been lost — in the dual and plural forms, it has merged with that of
the dual and plural suffixes. Here, too, we find that the interrogative
suffix is dropped when the form is preceded by an interrogative
pronoun. There are only two text examples available:
hedjw'axeigak hadxec-abe-n-oi-no-' have youthought of some way (to

or yagb-a'do- a-This form is reminiscent of the assertive paradigm. It appears to
have dropped the initial element of the assertive suffix preserving
the final -'a. It may be, therefore, that this initial element is the
assertive suffix and that -'a has to do with tense. There is still,
however, the problem of the pronoun suffixes — quite different in
this paradigm from what they were in the assertive. As before, we
find it best to consider this form apart from the assertive, even
though the resemblance is fairly close.
These forms are found rather frequently in the texts and here, too,
the final -' drops off when the form is preceded by an interrogative
pronoun.

"C. T H E PRONOUN(89—92)89. General Remarks.
We have already discussed (cf. 40—46) the pronominal affixes
of the verb. Here we shall treat the independent personal pronouns,
the possessive pronouns (which are independently expressed), the
interrogative pronouns, and the demonstratives. All of these
entities are treated as noun themes and take the regular noun
suffixes.
90. The Personal and Possessive Pronouns.
The independent personal pronoun is used only for emphasis —
normally the pronominal affixes of the verb are sufficient. Possessive forms, however, are normally expressed independently and
occur after the noun possessed — between it and its formal suffixes.
The pronominal scheme is as follows:

'a-u-xenThere are, then, only three personal pronouns, w-, na-~, and 'a-.
The others are made up by adding certain elements to these formsHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES123and, as may be seen in the above table, in a rather irregular manner.
-ya is evidently a personal suffix for the singular and dual — note,
however, that it is replaced by -ci- in the first person of the accusative and by -la in both the third person forms. The whole third
person is, however, irregular and the forms listed above are rarely
used. Note, also, the various ways in which duality and plurality are
expressed — in the first person dual by prefixing geu- which is a
verb prefix meaning "" u s "" ; in the second person dual by prefixing
we-, the pronominal prefix of plurality; and in the third person by
suffixing -we~. The plurals are similarly modified and, in addition,
take the plural case suffixes of the noun. Note, in the plural, that
the first person of the accusative becomes regular. The possessive
paradigm is no less irregular and I have no explanation for its
complexities.

There are four demonstrative themes, each distinguishing a
definite position with reference to the speaker. Thus, wa•- refers to
persons, places, and things which have been mentioned before:
the . . . aforementioned; de•- to persons, places, ana things in the
immediate neighborhood; he'e- or he'- to persons, places, and things
a distance away; and, we-- to persons, places, and things a greater
distance away. All vary their meanings according to whether they
are used alone (with appropriate case suffixes) or whether they
employ certain suffixes denoting place, direction or manner. There
is, then, the following configuration of forms.
ThemeP l a c e : -djaDirection: -Iwa•de'he'ewe'-was-dja
de'-dja
he'e-dja
——
de'-l
he'e'-l
we,'-ilManner: -dj, -didj
—
de'-dj
he'-dj
we'-dj, we'-didjThus wa'dja this particular spot aforementioned, de'dja this place,
and he'edja that place (we-- is not used with this suffix), wa-- cannot
be used with the direction suffix nor with the manner suffix, de-l
here, in this direction, he'e-l over there, that way, and we-'il far
away, way off in that direction. The last form is irregular : I have no
explanation of its structure, de'dj in this manner, he'dj in that
manner, and, we'dj, we-didj in that manner.
All of the themes, when used alone, are employed with certain
noun suffixes of case. The place, direction, and manner forms may
also be used with case suffixes: more often, however, they have
adverbial function and, as such, require no case suffixes. The
following table gives only the case forms for the four themes :

Chapter I I I of this paper. I t will be seen that when a person or
thing is mentioned for the first time in the text it will not have this
demonstrative but, as soon as it is mentioned again, it must employ
wa~- so that the listener will know the thing one is speaking of is one
mentioned before. Necessarly, of course, this demonstrative is
always found with the definite article since it refers to a specific
person or thing. I n the plural forms, however, the element denoting
the definite article seems to have been totally elided.

following two f o r m s : wa'-de-w'an towards this . . . aforementioned,
and wa'-de-dja this place aforementioned.
wa'-de-w'an 'a'be-k-a'we it isn't on this side aforementioned
war-de-dja ge'cdoxwno-n-o' I smell it right here
wa'-de-dja 'e'-no-n let's stay right here
na'ya yela'e-u wa'-de-dja you stay right here
Other compounds of this sort are probably possible: there are,
however, no examples other than those above.
Finally, there are a number of demonstratives not fitting into the
pattern given above. The most important of these is ge- which seems
to have a connotation of possession. Thus,
'a'x-ge-la hagne-k-a'we the water of (the river) has dried up 'a'x water,
hagne- to dry up, -a'we, modal enclitic, cf. 77.
gwa'n-ge-la 'ok-'a'la hw'ac hawe'lagw that woman of his has lots of hair. In
this example there is no possessive pronoun attached to gwa'n woman
but because of ge- the translation is correct.
gwa'n-wenxene-ge-la naxadjganw-o' our woman is married. Here both possessive pronoun wenxene- (cf. 90) and ge- are used but note that the
suffix -xen of the possessive pronoun is not employed.
da'he'banon-na'xen-ge-la ya'lo'na-gwa your friend has been killed. In this
example, the complete form of the possessive pronoun and ge- both are
used.
'en gwa'n-ge-la and my woman ?
gwa'n-la wa'dedja haglada-k-ge-lak ya'dj-abe-ga-' you did not see my woman

All the interrogative pronouns are characterized by an initial
element he- and it is apparent that most of them have been formed
by prefixing he- to a demonstrative theme. For example:
de'lhe-del
de'w'an
he-dew'an
de'dj
he-dedj
de'dja
he-dedjahere

A great number of verb themes may take this suffix which makes
them function as nouns. Examples:102HOIJER TONKAWA

ropehe.c'agohec'agw-anto shave oneself
razor (cf. 3)Many other examples could be listed — probably half the nouns
of the language are formed in this way. When the verb theme has an
element of the type CVw or CVy as final element, that element
becomes Co• and the noun suffix -n.

a subordinating suffix may be made into nouns by adding this
suffix to the second theme of the combination.

76. General Remarks.
The modal suffixes added to the -k form of the theme may, in
most cases, also be added to nouns, adjectives or demonstratives.
The modes so formed are the declarative, interrogative, resultative,
hortatory, quotative, and certain subordinated modes.
77. The Declarative -au, -a-we.
The declarative formed by adding -au to the -k form of the verb
differs from the ordinary declarative in t h a t it defines a completed
action. I t is ordinarily tenseless but may be used with the future
tense suffix. Examples:
didjgan-galalc-gageu'eiweidja-k-authe enemy have caught ushedjw'ax 'eye'-no-k-au something has happened to you
'egwan-wixwan-la hewawa-k-au a little dog has died

'a'x-ge-la hagne-k-a'we the water of the (river) has dried upHx 'e--ne-k-au you did wrongwa'dew'an '-abe-k-au it isn't on this sidena'ya da'hable-ne-k-au you have helped her-au may also be added to verb themes and to nouns. In those
cases, it defines a static notion. Examples:
hedjodjxo'-k-la geucog-au a bad one owns us (cog- to put away)
de'l heilab-au she is standing right hereheidicnan-au she is bashfuldjagau-e'e'-k-au where the creek is

yadalban-gwa'lou-lahedjn-au a big loaf of bread is lying thereI t appears very likely t h a t -au is a form of the auxiliary yem- to be,
which has become specialized in usage. I n support of this the
paradigm for ye'- in the present tense of the declarative mode is
appended.

singular which is the same as the modal enclitic described above
in form, and is probably cognate with it. Note, also, the curious
positions of the dual and plural subject elements which here come
before the theme itself. This phenomenon is unique with this
paradigm.
78. The Interrogatives, -ye, and -ye-lgwa.
-ye, added to the -k form of the verb, may be translated ""have
(you) done . . . "" ; while -ye%lgwa means ""are (you) certain of . . . "" ,
or ""do (you) assert t h a t . . . "" . Both may take the interrogative
suffix which is dropped when the form is preceded by an interrogative pronoun. The text forms available are nearly all preceded
by interrogative pronouns. Examples:
hededj '-a'do-nek-ye hedjw'ax-ei-ga nengoxo-l'ok what will you do if someone

"46. The Reciprocal Pronoun.
The reciprocal idea is expressed by a suffix -yew, -yo• and a
prefix he- or he--. It seems likely that this prefix is cognate with
that discussed in the preceding section: it is present in reciprocal
forms probably because they involve either a dual or plural subject.",[86]
"The peculiarities of this conjugation are unique. First, notice the
second person forms: evidently the suffix -gwa has combined with
an unknown suffix for the second person pronoun, but is is entirely
impossible to say where the division should be made. Note, also,
the irregular third person plural. I t is possible here t h a t we have the
full form of the suffix in -yagwa, the preceding -ya- pluralizing the
pronoun. If this is so, it must be assumed t h a t the -ya element of
the suffix has been totally elided in all the other forms of the verb,
leaving behind it only the compensatory lengthening of the vowels
of the elements preceding -gwa. And, finally, there is a striking
similarity between this paradigm — especially the third person form
— and t h a t discussed in section 57. I t is possible t h a t this has
substantially the same meaning as the -gwa mode save t h a t it
carries a subordinating connotation as well. Text examples follow:

This suffix is added to a constant theme, i. e., one not conjugated
for person and number. Person and number are expressed by the
principal verb for the two verbs. Text examples:
nex'eu-'a'lak nog-an 'eiwendjaganaklakno'o taking the gun, he killed them,
it is said
'awac-wa""-' a'la holgam'adjxe-dan-'an

'awac-'a'lak naul-'an yaxanoklakno'o cooking the meat, he ate it, it is said69. The Suffix -Vila while, when, as.
With this suffix, too, person and number are expressed by the
principal verb for the two verbs. This suffix may be used with the
future tense suffix but not with the continuative. I t serves to relate
two verbs defining actions t h a t take place simultaneously or
nearly so. Generally, it appears t h a t the action defined by the
principal verb results from t h a t of the subordinated verb •— but it
is clear t h a t both actions then continue together. Thus, in the
following example,
x'ax'ai'anoklakno'oweyadje-l'ilahe laughed when he looked at themthe context is as follows: a boy, seeing his uncles with shaven heads,
is moved to laughter and continues to laugh as he looks at them.
Examples:

I) will make arrows but have no knives

798HOIJEB TONKAWA70. The Suffix -d.
This suffix is added to the constant theme and may be used
together with the future tense suffix or the continuative. I t
characterizes a verb whose action immediately precedes that of
the principal verb. In some cases — as in the first example below —
the two actions take place together: the combination, in the example
mentioned, is practically a compound verb, viz., hedjne-d
maga"" t o lie weeping"". An interesting proof of the validity of such
compounds is found in the following example:
ba'bna-d
ba'bna-dyaxa- to set the table to eat (yaxa- to eat)
yax-an table; that which is set for eatingwhere the combination is made a noun by the noun forming suffix
-an. That the suffix nominalizes the whole compound and not
only yaxa- is clear because the word yax-an also exists but has the
meaning ""food"". Examples:
hedjne-d, ma'ganoklakno'o
he lay crying, it is said
cocgona-d xadjloklakno'o
hearing it, she became angry, it is said
hewawa-d xe'djneklakno'o
he fell down dead, it is said
haglana-d da'gonanoklakno'o
he went down looking for him, it is said
hadjxo-d yalxilnaklakno'o
jumping up, he ran away, it is said
ha'djcogonai-la
cocgo'na-d xa'xaklakno'o
Coyote, hearing him, came to him,
it is said
ha'djcogonai-la
xadjlo'-d heulaklakno'o
Coyote, being angry, seized him, it
is said

ha'nadjidjxil-xa'xa-d
'awac-wa'-'a'lak
wenengoxoklakno'o
arriving at a run,
they chased those buffaloes, it is said71. The Suffix -da and.
This suffix is also added to the constant theme and may be used
with future tense or continuative. Examples:
no'-da hengwa'na-gwa
he said and started off
necgaba-da haxeineklakno'o
he shut the door and went off, it is said
ya'dje-da haidjodaklakno'o

There are two participial suffixes in Tonkawa, -n and -k. The
former has been referred to as an infinitive suffix since it is added to
the verb form not conjugated as to person and number. I t is used,
however, as a third person plural in the -k paradigms.
73. The -n Suffix.
Used alone, the -n forms can be translated in two ways — as an
infinitive, and as a hortatory — according to circumstances. I t is
also used in the third person plural of the -k paradigm: this usage
will be discussed in section 74. The suffix is added to the theme plus
pronoun object.
The infinitive use of the -n form is illustrated by the following:
hedlo'no'c yaxa-n I don't want to eathedlo'no'c xana-n I don't want to drinkhedlo'no'ga yagba-n you don't want to hit himhedlo'no'c yagba'-n I don't want to hit youhedlo'no' geigaba-n he doesn't want to hit mebabacan'e yela-n ""'crx-gak xanida Vc"" nonoklakno'o (after) sitting a while,

it is saidBy far the most common use of the -n suffix is to put the verb in
the hortatory mode. This form of the hortatory is only used for a
definitely plural subject: the other form of the hortatory will be
taken up in section 80.
da'daglana-no-n let's take him down
hedjodjxa'yo-no-n let's go to sleep

da'ane-no-n let's keep him
wa'-de-dja 'e'-no-n let's stay right hereNote, in all the above examples, t h a t the -n suffix is added to the
theme plus the continuative suffix -no.
1*100HOIJEK TONKAWACertain theme compounds are formed by putting the first theme
of the compound into the infinitive form. The secondary themes
used in these compounds have no independent existence. They are
listed below.
-xwo nearly, almost
yagban-xwo'c
yagban-xwono'c
geigaban-xwono'I nearly hit him
I am almost hitting him
he is almost hitting me-bil outside, another place
This theme is attached to the infinitive form of the verb it
modifies. I t is never used without either the suffix -na off, away, or
-da towards, hither, following. Examples:
yaxan-bilno'c
yaxan-bildo'c
'e'eyo'-dan-bilda-klakno'o
nogo-dan-bilna-klakno'oI go there to eat
I come here to eat
she cooked it and brought it in to
them, it is said
she took them away, it is said74. The -k Suffix.
The -k suffix is attached to the theme plus its pronominal elements and may also be used with the future tense suffix and the
continuative. The paradigm is as follows:

"34. Final Theme Elements, 1.
In the preceding sections, we have discussed the types of verb
theme from the point of view of their initial elements and have
succeeded in isolating, with indifferent success, a number of such
elements. There are a number of themes which can be analyzed
more fully and these analyses affect principally the final elements
of the theme complex. With few exceptions, the same difficulties
attend these analyses as were present in the treatment of initial
theme elements — they are generally isolated cases incapable of
generalization.
The best defined of these final theme elements are -na and -da,
meaning 'direction away from the speaker' and 'direction towards
the speaker', respectively. In a number of themes, they appear as
irremovable theme elements. These are listed below.
'eina'eida-to go away
to comedana-two persons go offna'xcognana'xcogda-to scout, guide away intr.
to guide this wayga'naga'da-to throw . . . away

to step this waydjedxanadjedxada-to jump away
to jump this wayhengwai-A third directive connotation is produced by adding the theme
prefix xa (x-) to a distance, with force (cf. 51) to forms employing
-da. This combination gives the meaning 'around, in a circle' to the
theme.
xa-gadaxe'ngwa'daxa-yoxdaxa-coyadaxa-djgada-to throw . . . in a circle, swing (compare: ga'na- to throw . . . away)
to run in a circle (hengwa'da- to come
running)
to fly in a circle
to swim in a circle
to pace in a circleTwo of the themes 'to go' employ a suffix -xa giving the connotation
of arrival at a certain point. In both cases, the themes require also
the prefix xa- to a distance.
xa'xa-one person arrives at a distant pointfrom ha rm- one person goes off; xa- plus ha•-, giving xa-- and the
suffix -xa of arrival replacing -na off, away.
xadxa-two persons arrive at a distant pointfrom dana- two persons go off.
There are also a number of test forms involving these elements —
themes which can stand without the elements and to which the
elements may be added.
