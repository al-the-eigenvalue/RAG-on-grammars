"Clitics
There are at least four enclitics found on fully inflected verb forms in Gumuz, twoof which are only found in SoG: the Yes/No question clitic and the clitic indicating
perfect aspect. Both dialects have the negative clitic /=ŋgó/ but the Sirba Abay
subdialect (SoG) has a distinct form /=cê/. A hearsay clitic is present in both dialects as
well. Clitics in Gumuz are phonologically bound in that tonal downstep of H tones does
not occur between the verb (or noun) and the enclitic, and there exists no phonological
pause between morphemes. However, the final /a/ on the word to which it attaches is
pronounced [a] instead of [ə] as though the vowel were in word-final position (see
Chapter II). All known clitics, with the exception of the aspectual clitic in SoG, occur on
nouns as well as verbs in Gumuz. The Yes/No question particle is a clause final clitic
while the remaining enclitics are word-final.",[270]

The Yes/No question particle /=ác/ occurs in the Sirba Abay subdialect of SoG
(7.188, 7.190) and a related form, /=áj/ is used in Kamashi (7.189).",[271]
"206Other morphemes can occupy the first position on the verb; all but one (the
jussive) of these others introduce subordinate clauses: /nágó-/ ‘when, because’, /ká-/ ‘if’
(conditional), the relativizers /l-/ and /et-/, and the jussive /n-/. In this grammar, I refer to
all these first-position prefixes as markers of “mood”. Example (7.65) illustrates the
affirmative in a simple affirmative clause.

AFF-3SG.INTR-be.good‘It was good.’7.2.1.1 The Affirmative Marker and Question Constructions
Lack of the affirmative morpheme with a final rise in intonation generally
indicates a Yes/No question (7.66). In SoG, one must also add the Yes/No question
marker /=ác/ or /=áj/ to the end of the clause (7.67) (see also section 7.3.2).

SoG
(7.67) a-tʃʼá-gá
dagoná=ác
3SG.TR-have-NFUT young.woman =YNQ
‘Do you have a young woman (to exchange in marriage)?’
However, it is not always obligatory to omit the ‘affirmative’ marker for a
question. In example (7.68), the same speaker found the verb with or without the
affirmative marker acceptable as a Yes/No question.

For content questions, a question morpheme often takes the place of the
affirmative on the conjugated verb (7.69, 7.70). In SoG, the question words are not
bound and the affirmative marker can remain on the verb with all arguments that are
questioned. Some examples are given in (7.71) through (7.73). When either the S or O
arguments are questioned in SoG, the affirmative marker does not need to occur (7.74,
7.75).

NoG and SoG verbs lack the affirmative marker when the verb is negated. In
both NoG and parts of SoG (Kamashi) the negative clitic /=(a)ŋg̩ ó/ attaches to the end of
the conjugated verb. In (7.76) affirmative and negative forms of the same verb are used.

Certain subordinators in Gumuz occupy the same position on the nonfuture verb
as the ‘affirmative’ prefix. The subordinator ‘when, because’ / nágó-/ (NoG) is mutually
exclusive with the affirmative prefix (7.77).

(7.79) and /et(s)-/ (SoG) (7.80) occupy the first position of the verb and cannot co-occur
with the affirmative prefix.

9The non-initial or dependent (DEP) verbs of clause chains in SoG are marked with /-(á)ná/ in addition to
their lack of the affirmative prefix. If the affirmative is added to a non-initial (dependent, non-main) verb,
the resulting interpretation is that there is a lag in time between events.","[235, 236, 237, 238, 239]"

‘I will stab you with my uncle’s rooster’s claw.’The incorporated dative can indicate reason or cause. As question words/phrases
denoting reason or cause are formed with a dative prepositional phrase, the incorporated
preposition appears to index these causal obliques. The dative preposition is used as part
of a complex word used to express ‘why?’ and ‘because’ ká-ts(á) / kâ-nts(á) (for what?).
Consider the questions (a) and respective responses (b) in (7.116) and (7.117). The
dative /ká-/ of the question word corresponds to the dative suffix on the verb in both
(7.116a) and (7.117a). Likewise, the dative form in the answer, whether as part of the
purposive (7.116b) or part of the question word, correlates to the dative affix on the verb
of the question. Alternatively, the dative form is part of the repeated “question word” in
the answer with the meaning ‘because’ (7.117b).

‘Cat said, «I’m going to eat you because I’m dying of hunger.»’Similar use of the dative on both the question word and the verb to denote reason
is found in SoG. In (7.118a) /ká-/ [gá-] occurs on the verb and correlates with /ká-/
prepositional element of the question word ‘why?’ Again, the dative prefix occurs on the
verb in the answer, indicating ‘because’ (7.118 b, 7.119).

223In some instances, it is possible for the dative/benefactive preposition as well as
the object of the dative/benfactive to occur simultaneously on the verb. In (7.120), the
intransitive verb stem pá-ts ‘go out, emerge’ takes the incorporated dative /ká-/ along
with the object of the benefactive /íla-/ 1PL inclusive. The fully inflected verb means ‘it
came out well for us’. Similarly, in (7.121) the verb incorporates the dative preposition
along with the object of the preposition ‘me’ with the meaning ‘it is heavy for me.’(7.120)NoG

For transitive verbs (in NoG), if the dative is marked on the verb simultaneously
with the object and subject, the dative follows the pronominal marking in both the
nonfuture and future tenses (7.122-7.123). 2121The intransitive verb forms from (7.120, 7.121) were from a different consultant than the transitive verb
forms in (7.122, 7.123). Both consultants are from the Mandura area but the differences could be due to
dialect nonetheless. The incorporated dative with object form is yet again slightly different in Innocenti’s
Grammar of Mandura, where the incorporated dative is repeated at the end of the future tense verb: d-e-çər-açə-kə-ka AFF-FUT-give-1SG-2PL-DAT-DAT (parsing is my own) ‘I will give to you all’ (2010: 89). This
repeated dative is also found in verbal stems comprised of a verb root and an incorporated noun in which
the incorporated noun is found word-finally and not contiguous with the root verifying that the two dative
morphemes are indeed part of the verb: e-çʼək-ər-açə-kə-ka-s? FUT-release-1SG-2PL-DAT-DAT-MOUTH
(parsing my own) ‘Shall I release for you?’ Innocenti provides another variation of this same verb in which
the two incorporated datives exhibit yet another order: e-cʼəkʼ-ər-k-acə-ka-s? (2010: 90).","[250, 251, 252, 253]"

which? ábé=gwáb
ábáThe variation between oodé and oor(á) ‘who?’ in SoG is due to dialectal variation
within SoG; Gumuz speakers from the Sirba variety tend to use oodé while speakers from
the Kamashi area tend to use oor(á). On the other hand, the variation between the nasal
and vowel in ats(é) / nts(é) ‘what?’8 exists for a single speaker in NoG (4.5, 4.20 4.23) . 9 It is not clear what causes this variation. When comparing constructions in
examples (4.5) and (4.20-4.22), it appears as though the nts questions a core argument (A,
S, or O), while ats questions all other (unmarked) arguments. For example, the verb ‘say’
is intransitive. Therefore, when questioning what was said, ats must be used (4.22).
However, data is sparse.

‘What is this?’It is likely that the final /-é / on these interrogative pronouns is an old copula as the final /-é / is only

89Innocenti (2010:54) also notes this variation between nts and ats in the Mandura variety (NoG).
However, Uzar (1989) only recorded the form without the nasal for the Sirba variety (SoG) ːaats(a).
Certain speakers I interviewed from Sirba Abay wereda (county) and Agelo Met’i wereda did not use nts,
only ats(á) / ats(é) to mean ‘what?’.",[142]
"1718Not all inherently possessed nouns are obligatorily marked with a possessive suffix. The one exception is
‘mother’ eá which was only uttered without a possessive marker when I questioned a SoG Gumuz language
consultant during elicitation. There exist a few exceptions to these possessive suffixes being limited to
body part terms and kinship terms in SoG, namely eba ‘home area’ which can take either the possessive
suffix endings or the genitive pronoun.

10.4.1 Ditransitive Clauses
In Gumuz, it is not possible to have three simple NPs in a clause that has
ditransitive semantics, 4 though it is possible to have two NPs plus a prepositional phrase.
The major question is whether there are any verbs, either simple or derived, that require
three participants syntactically. At this point, the evidence is not yet clear.
A ditransitive clause is a clause with three arguments, one functioning as subject,
one functioning as primary/direct object and the third functioning as a secondary/indirect
object, depending on the language. The three arguments are overtly required or at least
must have a definite null interpretation to be considered ditransitive (Fillmore et al.
2003). In Gumuz, there are no known clear examples of ditransitive verbal roots. Even
with the verb cá ‘give’ (NoG and SoG), which can be part of what might be considered a
ditransitive clause (10.28), to have a required third argument, the verb must carry an
incorporated preposition (10.31, 10.32). Without an incorporated preposition, either the
theme (10.29) or the recipient (10.30) is structurally optional. This is true for both SoG
and NoG dialects. In (10.28-10.30), the tone on the bound pronominal suggests that a
grammatical object is present, but in (10.29) any additional PP coding the recipient is not
required. There is no clear evidence in Gumuz that ditransitive verbal roots exist.","[370, 371]"

In another construction, the same form ats(é)= attaches to nouns adding the
meaning ‘simply, just, only’ for emphasis. In this same construction, nts(é)= cannot be
substituted for ats(é)=, and ats(é)= no longer functions as an interrogative pronoun

they are from Sirba Abay or Agelo Met’i wereda (county) (4.26, 4.27), while speakers of

Similar to demonstrative pronouns, plural marking can be added to interrogative
pronouns when the referents are animate. Plural marking tends to be reserved for
predicate nominals in both NoG (4.30, 4.31) and SoG (4.32, 4.33).12 However, it is also
possible to pluralize the interrogative pronoun when it is used to question a core
argument (4.34). Examples for NoG are from Innocenti (2010:53-54). 13

"99feminine nouns. According to Innocenti (2010:133), the lexeme éefə́háŋzha means
“uomo di razza bianca” (person of the white race) and the translation for another Gumuz
lexeme, éntúzhea (with a similar prefix), is “uomo di razza agaw”(person of the Agau
race). It is most likely therefore that the prefix/noun in question for ‘white foreigner’
does indeed come from eá ‘mother’ but with reference to lineage and not to a feminine
class of nouns.
Other forms listed in Table 3.5 have (possible) cognates in the related Koman
languages which lack this (presumed) feminine prefix. For example Gumuz ‘spider’
jántátóŋwá is cognate with tʼútɔ́ɔý ɔ́ ‘flea’ in Gwama (Lockwood 2006). 24 Likewise,
Gumuz éénkááraanza ‘dung beetle’ is kwáánza in Gwama (Lockwood 2006) (aanza is
‘feces’ in Gumuz). Lastly, Gumuz ‘lizard’ éékolíá is súkúlé in T’wampa (Uduk) (Beam
& Cridland 1979).
Further investigation is needed to determine if Gumuz did indeed have a genderbased (or feminine based) noun class system at one time and/or whether the presumed
feminine prefix once functioned as a diminutive (or otherwise). It appears, however, that
these perhaps ancient gender prefixes do not mark natural gender synchronically for at
least some of these words in Table 3.5. For éélúŋgwá ‘pig’ (SoG), the initial /éé/ is
maintained when the sex of the animal is specified: ‘boar (male pig)’ is ood-éélúŋgwá and
‘sow (female pig)’ is eákʼw-éélúŋgwá. As of yet, there is no known evidence of an ancient
masculine noun class other than nouns which merely begin with a labio-velar
approximate or a round vowel.","[128, 129]"
"1.5.1. Greenberg (1963) Classification
Using a method of mass comparison, Greenberg (1963) was the first to propose
Nilo-Saharan as one of the language super-families in Africa , based on 29 pieces of
grammatical evidence He proposed the subgroupings for NS found in Figure 1.4.
Nilo-Saharan Super-familySonghaiSaharanMabanKomaFurChari-NileGanzaKomanUduk Gule GumuzMaoFigure 1.4. Gumuz within the Nilo-Saharan Tree (Greenberg 1963)1.5.2. Bender Classifications
After having collected additional data on Gumuz, Bender (1981) concluded that
Gumuz appeared to be quite divergent from the other so-called Koman languages and
thus even began to question the subgrouping he had tentatively proposed in 1976.
Commenting on its lack of similarity to “Koman” languages, Bender (1979) states,
I found 10% or less common basic lexicon between Gumuz and
Koman languages in one study…and 8% or less in another.
Comparisons with other languages are even weaker. Grammatically,
22the case is not much better. At this point, Gumuz may be best
considered a possible isolate in Sahelian 22 -- perhaps not even a
Sahelian language at all (1979:40).
Nevertheless, Bender (1983:259) suggests that “there is a greater chance that
Koman is part of a larger family under Nilo-Saharan, ‘Komuz,’ consisting of Koman and
Gumuz”. Bender (1991) later proposes the classification seen in Figure 1.5. He labels as
“isolates” the first four languages that he proposes split from Proto-NiloSaharan. The five
language families from left to right in Figure 1.4 (starting with Maban and ending with
Berta), he labels “satellites.” The remaining group of languages, which includes Gumuz,
he labels “core.” He clarifies, however, that these names are for “descriptive
convenience and are not to be taken too literally” (1991:4). Bender (1991) recognizes
that there are still problems with trying to classify the Gumuz language, and ultimately
concludes that “It is embarrassing that the assumed natural families (Central Sudanic,
East Sudanic, Komuz) show some inconsistencies” (1991: 5).

“Komuz” as a family, concluding that Gumuz and Koman are “quite distinct, not

"Nominal Inflection
Nouns in Gumuz can be (but are not often) inflected for number (discussed below)and can be inflected for case (to be covered in Chapter XIII). In addition, nouns in NoG
and SoG can be marked with possessive pronoun suffixes (described in detail in section
4.2.2 of Chapter IV, “Pronouns”). Following is a position class diagram for inflectional
morphemes on the noun word in both NoG and SoG:
(Case)-(Number)-[Noun Stem]
As just mentioned, nouns in Gumuz are not often marked for number. Instead,
context and/or verbal inflection is used to determine number. 2 Compare the following:
NoG(3.1)mbáándá ɓaga gúmíza é-lá
d-a-ŋgaʃ-áts

‘Someone told (me) so.’(3.3)d-úu-tsá-ɓaga
ká=gó-ɓaaŋgá
AFF-3PL.INTR-go NOM-person DAT=place-monitor.lizard
‘The people went to the monitor lizard (approached the monitor lizard).’The fact that number is not generally inflectionally marked in Gumuz nouns, as
demonstrated in examples (3.1-3.3), has caused scholars to question the placement of
Gumuz within the Nilo-Saharan (N-S) family. Within Nilo-Saharan, a tripartite nominal
system of singulative (i.e. overt morpheme or stem shape for singular but zero for plural),
plurative (i.e. overt morpheme or stem shape for plural but zero for singular), and
replacive (i.e. overt morphemes or stem shapes for both singular and plural) marking is
widespread and is found in three of the six major original subfamilies proposed by
2Regarding examples (3.1-3.3), certain dialects within both NoG and SoG have a singular weak suppletive
form for ‘person (SG)’: /baha/ or /baχa/.",[101]
"The Gumuz Language1.1.1. Location
Gumuz is spoken in the Blue Nile valley (and the valleys of its tributaries) of
northwestern Ethiopia and the Roseires Dam area of southeastern Sudan (Republic of the
Sudan). The Gumuz people number 159,418 in Ethiopia (Ethiopian Census 2007) and
approximately 40,000 in Sudan (Lewis 2009). The language/dialect cluster extends as far
north as the district of Metemma in the Amhara region of Ethiopia and as far south as the
village of Dimt’u in the Benishangul-Gumuz region. It is spoken as far east as the
Mandura district to the north of the Blue Nile and as far west as the Roseires area along
the Blue Nile in Sudan (Bryan 1945, Jordan 2002). This entire area is not exclusively
occupied by the Gumuz people as they share much of the land with the Boro (Shinasha),
Bertha, Oromo, Amhara, Kunfel, and Awi 2 (Awngi speakers). However, the last four
groups tend to live in the highlands, while the Gumuz remain in the lowlands.
Figure 1.1 below is a language map of Gumuz, covering areas in both Ethiopia
and Sudan. An approximate border of where the Gumuz language is spoken is given in
green with red lines indicating major roads and blue lines for rivers. Not much is known,
however, about the Gumuz people and language in Sudan (indicated by question marks
on the map) other than brief accounts given by Schuver (1883), Bryan (1945) and James
(1977). The best approximation regarding their location in Sudan was provided in Bryan
1945 which included place names, longitude and latitude. In addition, Linda Jordan
interviewed some native Gumuz speakers at the Yarenja refugee camp in western
Ethiopia which is located along the Blue Nile just north of where the Biles and Blue Nile
rivers converge. All claimed to be from villages/towns located in and around the Blue
Nile Valley of the Sudan up to Er Roseires: Magaanza, Alman, Jarada, and “Riserisi”
(Jordan 2002) (presumably the last place name is Er Roseires). Around the turn of the last
century, a small group of Gumuz numbering around 1,000 were relocated south to an area
just outside the town of Welk’it’e by orders of Menelik, the emperor of Ethiopia (Bender2The Awi are often referred to as the “Agau” in much of the literature.",[32]

Bender was the first to cast doubt on Gumuz’s status as a Nilo-Saharan language
(1979:40) (see section 1.4.2 above). He later wrote in an article for Encyclopedia
Aethiopica that Gumuz may be an isolate (2005: 916):
The intriguing possibility remains that [Gumuz] may not be NiloSaharan after all, which means that it is an African “isolate” not
belonging to any of the great Africa phyla and perhaps representing
an ancient phylum now otherwise extinct.
Mikkola (1999), a both quantitative (statistical) and qualitative study, claims that
there are serious doubts about Gumuz sharing any significant lexical elements with NiloSaharan. Regarding these doubts Mikkola comments, “…the inclusion of questionable
units, at least Songai and Kuliak, plus Gumuz, could not be substantiated” (1999.:130).
He provides a tentative Nilo-Saharan classification with Gumuz as a possible
independent family outside of Nilo-Saharan.
Dimmendaal (2008:843) raised doubts about Gumuz and the Koman subfamily,
commenting that that their genetic status is “debatable” as they are lacking some of the
more widespread Nilo-Saharan morphological markers. But he concludes that their
“debatable” status is likely due to lack of data for these languages. Dimmendaal (2011:
297) later refers to Gumuz as an “isolate”.
(Ahland 2010b) revisited the question of Gumuz as a possible language isolate,
concluding that it is most likely a part of the Nilo-Saharan (N-S) super family. Gumuz
exhibits eleven of the forty-six retentions for N-S proposed by Greenberg (1963) and
later modified by Bender (1989, 1991). Despite the relatively low number of N-S
retentions, the classifier system in Gumuz may be a link to some of the more pronounced
typological features of Nilo-Saharan such as number-marking, case-marking, and
Greenberg’s ‘movable k’. While Dimmendaal notes that Gumuz lacks the archaic
typological feature of tripartite number marking (singulative, plurative, and replacive)
(2000, 2008), Ahland (2010b:15-17) argues that there is reason to believe the tripartite
number marking system is related to the Gumuz classifier system, as these classifiers can27also indicate number. In addition, the two most widespread accusative case markers in
N-S (Dimmendaal 2010:30), reconstructed as *-kɔ̀ (Ehret 2001:203) and *-si (Ehret
2001:205), 24 may be related to two of the verbal classifiers in Gumuz. Lastly, the class
morpheme /kʼoá-/ (CL1ːHEAD) has a similar distribution to and appears to be cognate
with Greenberg’s ‘movable k’ prefix (1963, 1981) found throughout N-S languages.
In addition to positing a possible historical relationship to the three typological
features of N-S noted above, (Ahland 2010b) also finds that at least one classifier in
Gumuz (/-Vc/, /cá-/ CL1ːEYE) encompasses a nearly identical idiosyncratic semantic
class to the ‘object reference marker’-s(I) found in Fur, a N-S language of Sudan. 25 Table
1.1 demonstrates the semantic categories represented in the two languages.

imperative is formed with the verb root followed by a bound subject pronominal plus
other possible stem morphology (e.g. directional, IN/Classifier). The jussive is formed
with the prefix /n-/ or /l-/ (for some speakers of NoG) followed by a bound third person
subject pronominal plus the verb stem (see also Example 8.124 of Chapter VII). For

"Plurals by Reduplication
A third small subset of nouns can be marked plural via reduplication of the initialconsonant plus the addition of /áá/. This may be a combination of strategies:
reduplication of the initial consonant plus /a/ with plural vowel lengthening (resulting in
/áá/). Such a combination is only attested in SoG by speakers who live in and around
Kamashi town (but may be used elsewhere as well) (see examples 3.18, 3.19). 10
Reduplicated forms indicating plural are also found in derived nouns (see also example
(6.28) of section 6.2.3 of Chapter VI).
8The word for ‘guest’ would not be an exception to vowel lengthening if one considers that /koa/ [kwə] is
realized as [ko] (or [ku]) when a consonant follows. Thus, [kodóχwá] ‘guest’ must be /koadóχwá/ or
/koadóχwá/ underlyingly. Otherwise, one would expect the /o/ to lengthen (or not be subject to this
lengthening process at all, considering that /a/ is the only known vowel to undergo lengthening to mark
plural). The other alternative is to assume that /-á-/ is a plural infix for this subset of nouns (similar to
Chadic). This analysis has its merits since it explains the addition of H tone. See also the discussion of
vowel length contrasts in Chapter II.
9The words for ‘my older brother’ and ‘my older sister’ are multimorphemic with the /-mâ / 1SG POSS
suffix. Also, ‘older brothers’ is an apparent exception to the first /a/ vowel being lengthened. However, if
all of these lexemes are polymorphemic historically, it may be that the final /a/ of the first (historical)
morpheme is lengthened.",[107]

When the verb stem is intransitive, the RC construction (for relativizing on
objects of comitative/instrumental prepositions) is similar to RCs which relativize on an S
argument; the bound subject pronominal on the RC verb demonstrates an intransitive
tonal pattern (12.81). As mentioned above, the RC must be postnominal. For transitive
verbs, the verb of the RC exhibits a transitive tonal pattern. Similar to clauses
relativizing on A arguments, a /-a/ suffix is added to the verb of the RC if the O argument
is part of the RC and either precedes the verb or is not overt. In (12.81), the O argument
‘field’ of the second RC is understood and is indicated with the /-a/ suffix. If the O
argument is overt and follows the verb, no /-a/ suffix is needed as with the RC of (12.80)
and the first RC of (12.82).
When relativizing on the object of a dative preposition, the dative preposition /ká/
is incorporated into the RC verb. This is demonstrated in (12.83) within a question
construction. An incorporated dative preposition can be used to indicate cause or reason
(see Chapter VII). The construction in (12.83) is relativizing on the reason for someone’s
actions represented by the interrogative pronoun ‘what’. The incorporated dative
indicates that ‘what’ is the object of the dative, meaning ‘for what?’. As the verb of the
RC is intransitive, the tonal pattern on the bound subject pronominal reflects an
intransitive tonal pattern, namely L tone for 2SG.

419Lastly, one can also relativize on the object of a locative preposition using either
the bare relativizer strategy or the relative pronoun plus relativizer strategy. The
incorporated locative suffix is added to the verb of the RC and the object of the locative
is the head of a postnominal RC. The RC in (12.84) is transitive while the one in (12.85)
is intransitive.

12.3.1.8‘Where’/‘Place’ RelativizationThe relative pronoun /gw-/ ‘where, place where’ may be the only true relative
pronoun in NoG if one assumes that a relative pronoun is a relativizer which reflects one
or more features of its co-referent. The other relative pronouns /dá(á)-/ and /etá-/ only
maintain features of their co-referents (number, animacy) in nominalized RCs (and
/dá(á)-/ is not used in finite RCs). The relative pronoun /gw-/, on the other hand,
maintains the features of ‘place’ or location in both finite and non-finite RCs.
RCs introduced with /gw-/ can have a head or be headless (12.89). If there exists
an overt head, the RC is often postnominal (12.86, 12.87). However, the RC can also be
prenominal (12.88). The tonal pattern on the bound subject pronominal of the verb
follows that of main clause verbs. Lastly, the headless RC can also function as a
complement clause. In (12.89), the RCs ‘where he lay down’ and ‘where he died’ are
functioning as O arguments of the matrix verb ‘find’. 2020The classifier /-ats/ CL:BODY on ‘find’ in (12.89) suggests that the O argument is body-like or has a
body. Thus, it may be that ‘hyena’ is the implied O argument and not the locations ‘where he lay down’
and ‘where he died’.","[447, 448, 449]"
"255two bare objects. Indirect objects are marked with the prepositional proclitic ka=.
However, it could be the case that ‘belly’ and ‘house’ form a nominal compound which
functions as the O argument and that ‘belly’ is not incorporated into the verb. Indeed
there exists a nominal compound: líí-mátsʼá (belly-house) ‘floor’. However, one can see
that ‘belly’ forms a phonological unit with ‘house’ in this NN compound as the vowel
and the consonant metathesize. In contrast, when forming a phonological unit with the
verb, ‘belly’ maintains its vowel-consonant structure: -ííl.13 In Southern Gumuz, however,
such a metathesis does not occur as the initial vowel-consonant structure is often found in
the noun stem as well as in the IN. Thus, other (syntactic) evidence would be necessary
for this dialect to demonstrate that the noun root contiguous with the verb root and the
following O argument do not actually form a NN compound. Indeed, both incorporation
and compounding are possible in Gumuz for clauses with (nearly) identical translations.
But there are clear differences between the structures as shown both by phonology and
negative placement. In (8.29a), the noun ílúkʼwá ‘head’ is incorporated into the verb stem.
However, in (8.29b) ílúkʼwá ‘head’ forms a compound with hosa ‘cow’14 and this
compound functions as the O argument. Both clauses can propositionally mean ‘Skin the
cow’s head’. In Gumuz, the negative =ŋg̩ ó is an enclitic that attaches to both nouns and
verbs. Examples (8.30 a-b) provide the negative forms of the commands in (8.29 a-b),
demonstrating that there is a word boundary between ‘head’ and ‘cow’ in example
(8.29a). On the other hand, the word boundary in (8.29b) is after the verb root kóɗ ‘skin’
as demonstrated with its negative form in (8.30b). Thus, (8.29a) and (8.30a) must have
INs in the verb stem as the negative enclitic should not separate the two noun roots of a
NN compound.","[284, 285]"
"7.3.1. Negative Clitics
There exist two negative clitics: /=ŋgó/, which is used in both NoG and SoG and
/=cê/, which is used by Gumuz speakers living in and around Sirba Abay wereda
(county) as well as parts of Wenbera and Agelo Met’i weredas. These clitics are
restricted to attaching to main clause verbs (7.185-7.187); when negating a subordinate
clause, one must use (with some exceptions) a negative auxiliary (see Chapter XI,241examples 11.64, 11.65). Also, as stated previously in section 7.2.1.2, the negative clitic
does not normally co-occur with the affirmative prefix.","[270, 271]"

INTRODUCTIONGumuz is a Nilo-Saharan language/dialect cluster spoken in Western Ethiopia and
across the border in southeastern Sudan. This study compares the phonology and
selected aspects of the grammar of two major dialects within the Gumuz cluster:
Northern Gumuz (NoG) and Southern Gumuz (SoG), both of which are spoken in the
Benishangul-Gumuz Region of western Ethiopia. Analysis is based on twenty months of
fieldwork in Ethiopia conducted from September of 2007 through April of 2009.
Language data was gathered from thirty-three native speakers of Gumuz: fourteen from
NoG and nineteen from SoG. The Gumuz language consultants provided a total of sixtyeight texts of varying lengths and multiple genres, thirty-four texts from NoG and thirtyfour texts from SoG. In addition, a list of approximately two thousand words was
collected from each dialect as well as countless hours of elicited language data. To aid in
further comparison, I worked with two additional Gumuz language consultants from
Yaso wereda 1 eliciting several hours of language data and one text. To date, this is the
first description of Gumuz which analyzes and compares the grammar and phonology of
the two main dialects - that of the north and that of the south. In addition, this description
includes the first tonal analysis of any Gumuz dialect.
This first chapter gives an overview of the Gumuz language, where it is spoken, a
description of the dialect cluster, Gumuz culture, history, and migrations. It also includes
a review of previous descriptions of the Gumuz language and the various attempts to
classify it. Chapter II provides a description of the phonological inventories of NoG and
SoG, phonological rules, and a discussion of tonal contrasts as well as tonal downstep
and related rules. Chapter III covers the basic shape and phonology of simple noun words1A wereda is a political division roughly equivalent to a county in the United States. Ethiopian regions are
divided into zones, which are further divided into weredas. A wereda, in turn, is divided into smaller units
called k’ebeles.","[28, 29, 30]"

What I label a ‘negative command’ in Gumuz includes both the negative of
imperative forms as well as the negative of jussive forms. Negative imperative and
jussive forms are structurally the same: /ka-/ INSTR + ma- construction + bound subject
pronominal + negative enclitic in NoG and ma- construction + bound subject pronominal
+ negative enclitic in SoG. The 2SG form is often unmarked in SoG (11.80). 13 I gloss the
resulting /kama-/ (NoG) and corresponding /ma-/ (SoG) prefixes as NEG.IMP (negative
imperative).

A negative circumstantial adverbial clause is a dependent clause expressing an
event that did not or will not happen before the event of the matrix clause. These are
often translated into English as ‘without X-ing, ...’ In NoG, the construction for negative
adverbials is as follows: /kaʒiigá=/ + /mâ-/ (an abbreviated form of the purpose prefix) +
the verb root + any applicable morphemes ordered according to the future tense (13.24).
The /kaʒiigá=/ clitic appears to be comprised of the instrumental preposition /ka=/
followed by the verb root ʒiig ‘be poor, be without’. The final /á/ in this clitic complex is
440likely a remnant from the dative proclitic /ká=/ which forms the purposive prefix /káma-/
or /kám -/̀ (see Chapter 11). The /kaʒiigá=/ clitic is also found with NPs meaning
‘without’ or ‘except’ (13.25).","[469, 470]"
"54329lexical to more grammatical, with free nouns on the lexical end of the continuum and
verbal affixes on the grammatical end. Table 9.4 outlines this range of syntactic
behaviors. The one problem between this table and a grammaticalization continuum is
the location of ‘class morpheme’ on the continuum. Nominal class morphemes are
possibly more toward the lexical end of the continuum than are verbal classifiers but
placed in Table 9.4 based on the range of syntactic behaviors found.
The NoG variety was chosen for the data in this table as this variety includes both
complex and simple noun stems as classifiers and class morphemes. Thus, the range of
syntactic behaviors is the most extensive. All verbal classifier forms are included in Table
9.4, while only representative forms for other morphemes are included. For example,
waagá, a species of mushroom, is merely representative of all nouns which exhibit no
classifier syntax or classifying function nor can function as a head root in a NN
compound. 55 In the same way, ‘bone’ represents all nouns which can act as a head noun
in NN compound but do not form a strong class or category in the language (nor co-occur
with a verbal classifier of the same nominal origin). The ‘mouth’ and ‘place’ morphemes
are included in this table as they questionably form classes in the language. Finally,
morphemes such as cá ‘eye’, kʼwá ‘head’, -(V)ts ‘body’ (and possibly gwá ‘place’) have
grammaticalized beyond their noun classifying functions to verbal affixes which mark
various abstract and clausal arguments and have developed other syntactic functions
(discussed further in Chapters VII and X).","[358, 359]"
"312999.2 Class Morphemes
One distinct category of nominal compounds in Gumuz, which may hold the key
to the origins of verbal classifiers in Gumuz, is that of class morpheme compounds.
These are often found within nominal compounds, similar to those found in English, e.g.
man: mailman, policeman etc. This use of class morphemes in Gumuz appears to be
related to emphasis or focus, but also may be used for quantifying nouns (to some
extent).
In Gumuz the class morphemes appear to be historically related to the simple root
forms of the verbal classifiers. Having the same (or similar) class morpheme on verbs as
well as on nouns is similar to what Aikhenvald (2000:204) labels ‘multiple classifier
systems’ in which the same set of classifying morphemes can be used in more than one
classifier environment. The main difference is that the Gumuz class morphemes may not
be “prototypical” classifiers per the extant linguistic literature on classifiers. Nonetheless,
the few class morphemes that have been documented in Gumuz have many of the
properties of noun classifiers, both ‘definitional’ (i-iii) and ‘contingent’ (iv-vi) as outlined
by Aikhenvald (2000:81):
i) their presence in a noun phrase is independent of other constituents inside or
outside it.
ii) their scope is a noun phrase.
iii) they are a type of non-agreeing noun categorization device whose choice is
determined by lexical selection and not by matching any inflection properties
of nouns with any other constituents of a noun phrase.
iv) the choice of classifier is based on semantics.
v) one noun can be used with different classifiers, with a change in meaning.","[328, 329]"

The Reverend Henning and Edith Uzar, missionaries with the German
Hermannsburg Mission or ELM, began learning and researching the Gumuz language
around the time that Unseth conducted his dialect survey. In 1989, the Reverend
published an article on the phonology as well as the tense/mode/aspect system of the
variety of Gumuz spoken where he was working, Sese. Because the consonant phoneme
chart of Unseth (1989: 617) was provided to him via personal communication, there is
practically no difference in the consonant phoneme chart from Unseth’s article.
Uzar agrees with Unseth’s analysis in regard to the labialized velar stops,
analyzing them as single segments which are allophones of their nonlabialized
counterparts (1989:354). However, he suggests modifying the morpheme-final rule to
state, “labialized velars occur in morpheme-final position except before rounded vowels.”
He further asserts that this labialization causes vowel rounding when a suffix is added,
positing the following rule (1989:355):
C+ [] --> Co, Cu
As to the syllable patterns of Gumuz, Uzar demonstrates the possible syllable
nuclei, syllable structures, and number of syllables within a single word. Like Unseth’s
analysis (Unseth 1989:625-628), Uzar shows that nasals often occupy the syllable
nucleus (1989:366). The following are the possible syllable structures he provides with
V indicating the syllable nucleus and S indicating sonorant: V, CV, CVC, CVSC, VC,
and CSV (1989:367). It should be noted that syllabic nasals only occupy the V and VC
patterns. Lastly, Uzar explains that while nouns usually consist of only one or two
syllables, verbs generally consist of three or more. He documents verbs as long as
eleven syllables (1989:367, 368).
With respect to the tense system of Gumuz, Uzar documents a remote past tense
which had not previously been described. Also, he provides evidence that Irwin’s
present-past and past completed tenses could very well be combined into one tense. He
further notes that present continuous is better interpreted as an aspect and “present
anticipation is not at all a tense” (1989:370).
17Because both Irwin and Uzar had analyzed the same variety, Sese, Uzar adds as a
disclaimer that “there remains the possibility of non-trivial dialectal differences in verb
morphology” within Gumuz (1989:370). He reduces Irwin’s three verb types to two,
labeling them split and unsplit. 20 The root in the unsplit type stays intact while the root in
the split type is interrupted by the first part of a discontinuous suffix, -aka, and is then
followed by the last part of the verb root (1989:371).
Uzar also provides data illustrating the future tense, remote past, as well as the
perfective, frequentive, and continuous aspects. In addition to tense and aspect, he
provides examples of jussive, conditional/irrealis, interrogative, and negative moods.
Lastly, Uzar provides a paradigm of person markers which seems to differ slightly from
those of Bender (1979).
Uzar (1997) is an unpublished introductory course for the Gumuz language. Even
though the intended audience is not linguists, the booklet is somewhat of a linguistic
description of the language, complete with a consonant phoneme chart, phonological
rules, morphology and syntax. In this course booklet, Uzar revises his consonant
inventory to include labialized segments, perhaps due to Unseth’s comment that he
believed the labialized velars were diachronically moving toward phonemic status in the
language. The revised analysis includes thirty-eight consonants.
Like Unseth, Uzar (1997) only posits two levels of tone for the Sese (SoG)
variety. He acknowledges, however, that sometimes a middle tone can be heard, but he
maintains that “middle tone seems to be not phonemically relevant (it is only a
predictable phonetic variant).” He subsequently gives examples of lexical items that
follow four “tone patterns:” high-high, low-low, high-low, and low-high (1997:10).
As to comparative work with Gumuz dialects, Uzar provides a comparative chart
of numerals from the Gumuz spoken in Agelo Meti and Sirba Abay. He also reports that
the Gumuz in these two areas rely extensively on the numerals of a neighboring Cushitic
language, Oromo, especially for numbers higher than twenty (1997:36).","[45, 46, 47]"

NONFINITE NOMINAL MODIFICATION CONSTRUCTIONSIn Gumuz, there exist two main constructions for nonfinite nominal modification:
the Associative Construction and the Attributive Construction. Both of these
constructions are noun-noun (NN) collocations in which one noun modifies the other.
Both constructions exhibit characteristics of compounds and phrases; thus, these NN
collocations are not clearly one or the other. The Associative Construction is described
in section 6.1 and is briefly contrasted with the Genitive Construction. The Attributive
Construction is described in 6.2. Each construction is described in terms of semantics,
the characteristics of compound versus phrase, and headedness. Section 6.3 describes the
historical relationship between the two constructions and section 6.4 discusses other NN
collocations involving nominalized verbs. More lexicalized compounds that have
historically arisen from the Associative Construction are covered in Chapter III.
6.1The Associative Construction: N H N D
The Associative Construction in Gumuz is a NN collocation in which the secondnominal of the compound modifies the first nominal. The semantics of this construction
convey possession/association of the sort ‘N of N’ but it is distinct from the Genitive
Construction (see discussion in section 6.1.1). Similar to the “associative construction”
described by Welmers (1973:275-276), mainly for the “Niger-Kordofanian” languages,
the range of meanings for the Associative Construction found in Gumuz is much broader
than that of the Genitive Construction, covering possession, material, contents, and
function/purpose.11Similar constructions in Nilo-Saharan have been labeled “anti-genitive” for Päri (Andersen 1988:284) and
Bert(h)a (Andersen 1995, Benishangul-Gumuz Language Development Project 2007:207), “modified noun
form” for Anywa (Reh 1996:116), and “status constructus” (Tucker and Bryan 1966:83) among others.","[178, 179, 180]"

There are at least four known auxiliaries in Gumuz: ‘go’, ‘be’ and two negative
auxiliaries batsʼ and ko. 10 All four of these auxiliaries precede their verbal complements.
The following subsections describe the complements of the ‘go’ auxiliary and the two

Complements of Negative AuxiliariesTo negate a subordinate clause verb in Gumuz (save a few exceptions), one must
use a negative auxiliary in place of the negative enclitics =ŋgó (NoG, SoG-Kamashi) or
=cê (SoG-Sirba Abay) that are used for main clause verbs (see Chapter VII for further
discussion of negative enclitics). There exist two negative auxiliaries ko and batsʼ(-áʃ),
both of which are used in SoG (11.49, 11.60, 11.61), while only batsʼ is used in NoG
(11.43, 11.59). For most subordinate clauses, the complement of these negative
auxiliaries is a non-finite form of the ma- construction. 11(11.59)NoG

Class morphemes are classifying morphemes which form compounds with certain
nouns. These compounds are structurally similar to NN compounds (of the Associative
Construction, Chapter VI) with the class morpheme functioning as the initial noun head.
They differ from NN compounds in that the class morpheme compound can have the
same referent with or without the class morpheme. In (9.120), one can say ‘tomorrow’301either with or without the class morpheme cá- ‘eye’ which classifies units of time in
addition to mass nouns, etc. 32(9.120)NoG

AFF-FUT-drink-1SG.TR COM=morrow

‘I will drink (something) tomorrow.’Class morphemes in Gumuz differ from “prototypical” noun classifiers in that
they are not very productive. Gumuz verbal classifiers, in contrast, arose from the same
source body part nouns as class morphemes but are more productive as noun
categorization devices. There is also evidence of a synchronic (syntactic) relationship
between the two.
As we have seen, class morphemes in NN compounds appear to affect the choice
of verbal classifier on the verb. 33 This is analogous to the syntactic behavior of class
term compounds in Tai languages (DeLancey 1986) in that both class term compounds of
Tai langauges and class morpheme compounds in Gumuz tend to co-occur with their
classifier counterparts. The main difference, however, is that the classifiers in Tai
languages are numeral classifiers whereas the classifiers in Gumuz are verbal classifiers.
In example (9.28) of section 9.1.1.1, the nominal compound with the class morpheme
/kʼwá-/ ‘head’ combined with the noun root ‘rock’ appeared as the O argument of the verb
‘heat’. The choice of verbal classifier on the verb, therefore, was /-ílúkʼw/ ‘head’ in
accordance with the class morpheme.
Likewise, ‘bone’ can be expressed either as a compound with a class morpheme
or as the simple root ʒákwá ‘bone’ without the class morpheme /kʼwá-/ ‘head’. 34 With the
32While the language consultant could not see any semantic difference between the two forms of
‘tomorrow’ in (9.120), I suspect that the phrase involving the class morpheme may indicate a more
punctual or exact point in time.
33The co-existence of, in addition to the agreement between, these two systems of classification is likely
significant in the historic development of verbal classifiers in Gumuz. In Tai, it has been documented that
classifiers originated as class terms (DeLancey 1986) which could be the case for Gumuz.
kʼwá-ʒákʼwá ‘head-bone’ is a class morpheme compound and does not refer to ‘skull’ as one might
suspect. The word for ‘skull’ requires what could be called an associative construction with ‘bone’ as the
head of the compound and ‘head’ following: ʒákʼwá-lúkʼwá ‘bone-head’.
34302class morpheme compound, the verbal classifier /-ílúkʼw/ is used in the NoG variety
(9.121). The same class morpheme compound exists in SoG but the simple root classifier
/-(V)k ʼw / is used on the verb (9.122). In both varieties of Gumuz, the class morpheme in
these examples is optional.","[330, 331, 332]"

[bə́ɾká]AFF-3.SG.INTR-go-NFUT‘S/he went.’
Other voiced stops in SoG tend to weaken post-vocalically as well. The voiced
bilabial implosive /ɓ/ tends to weaken to an unreleased voiced bilabial stop [b̚] wordfinally, while the voiced bilabial stop /b/ weakens to a fricative (in some dialects) wordfinally (which is in opposition to the final devoicing ‘rule’). 10 This is evidenced in the
near minimal pair /táɓ/ ‘do again’ and /tab/ ‘be thick’ which are pronounced [tə́b̚] and
[təβ] respectively.
Lastly, speakers of SoG have a tendency towards haplology. That is, a CV
syllable which is (nearly) identical to an adjacent syllable tends to be deleted, especially
if the V of the CV syllable is a short /a/ and carries L tone. For example, the underlying
form of ‘we (exclusive) shouted’ is /b-íla-lúŋg-ágá/ (AFF-1PL.EXCL.INTR-shout-NFUT).
Because the 1PL inclusive morpheme ends with the CV syllable /la/ and the following
syllable begins with /lú/, the first syllable in the sequence is deleted and the word
surfaces as [bílúŋgə́gá].1110The speaker who demonstrated the word-final weakening is from Kamashi town, Kamashi wereda.",[75]
"2.3.2 Nasal Insertion and Velar Weakening
NoG and SoG demonstrate a regular sound correspondence between the uvular
fricative (in NoG) and the velar nasal (in SoG). I had previously identified this sound
change as *ŋ > h (Ahland 2004). However, there is reason to believe that the sound in
proto-Gumuz was a voiceless velar stop *k. In Ahland (2004: 82), this hypothesis was
presented as an alternative analysis but initially rejected based on the complexity of the
analysis. I now believe that this unusual sound correspondence may be reflexes of nasal
insertion before velars in SoG, and the weakening of the voiceless velar from *k > Ø in
SoG (following nasal insertion), and *k > h > χ in NoG. Thus, the etyma corresponding63to the regular sound correspondence in Table 2.14 would be *kʼaka ‘crocodile’, *tika ‘ant’,
*ɓak ‘hunt’, and *uka ‘fish (n)’.

‘fish (n.)’There exists some evidence that nasals were inserted before velar stops
historically in Gumuz. For example the historical compound for ‘leaf’ is tsʼínɟá which is
comprised of tsʼéa ‘ear, leaf’ and ɟá ‘tree’ (<*gʲá). Also, there exists variation between
the pronunciations of certain words which involve a voiced velar stop following a vowel.
For example, the word for ‘three’ is pronounced [okáág] in NoG versus [okááŋk] in SoG.
Lastly, there is indirect evidence for nasal insertion in that native speakers of SoG tend to
insert nasals before voiced velar stops when speaking Amharic, a language of wider
communication in Ethiopia. That is, a word such as /ʃɨmagəle/ ‘elder’ from Amharic is
pronounced [ʃɨmaŋgəle]. Other evidence that the proto-Gumuz sound representing the
sound correspondence in Table 2.14 may have been a post-vocalic *k is found in the
ideophone vakavak ‘sound of something moving through the air’ (or vak ‘single motion
through the air’). This eventually was adopted as a verb, taking full verbal inflection in
both NoG and SoG. In NoG, the verb is váχ ‘clear land (for planting) and in SoG the
verb váŋ ‘cut (grass) with a sickle’.","[92, 93]"
"2427.3.3. Aspectual Clitic (SoG)
In addition to the incorporated locative indicating (present) perfect aspect
(section 7.2.3.2), there also exists an enclitic (or possibly a phonologically distinct word)
that indicates perfect aspect: nʒígán(á). Uzar (1989:377) identified a similar morpheme
in the Sirba subdialect of SoG, nžiina, and labeled it a “perfective/completive” aspect
marker. While the locative functioning as perfect aspect seems to be restricted to
nonfuture, the nʒígán(á) clitic can be used for nonfuture or future tenses. 26(7.191)(7.192)SoG

clitic is used to indicate that the information given is known because someone had told

kʼón ‘beg’In SoG, /gam/ varies with /ga ŋ/ for ‘know’. Thus, this is a very weak contrast as there exist no better data

(9.129). The compound in (9.129) can be contrasted with the complex form of the word
for ‘eye’ in (9.130). The complex form in (9.130) can either refer to ‘eye(s)’ or ‘face’
and may be class morpheme compound. The mysterious body part prefix lí-/ íl(previously mentioned in Chapter VIII) may be related to another class morpheme which
is used to categorize a general delimited area, líí-/ ííl- ‘belly’.","[333, 334]"

Constructions with /góá-/ as the head also follow a cline from more nominal to less
nominal; if the dependent noun is a non-derived noun, the whole construction is on the
nominal end. If the second dependent noun is a nominalization, the whole construction is
on the verbal end of the cline. Example (12.40) is a more nominal NN collocation. As
numerals in Gumuz are somewhat noun-like (see Chapter V), the instance in example
(12.41) is considered more nominal as well. In contrast, examples (12.17-12.24) are
towards the verbal end of the cline.","[429, 430]"
"Object Complements Formed with /ée-/ Plus ma-In NoG, complements of ‘suggest’, ‘say, tell’ and gam ‘know’ are formed with
/ée-/ plus a non-finite form of the ma- construction. In (11.50), the matrix predication
meaning ‘suggest’ is formed with the verb taaé ‘bring’ plus ŋgaʃá ‘spoken thing’. The
clausal complement of ‘suggest’ is /ée-/ followed by a nominalized form of the verb kóras ‘open’ which is transitive and thus requires the inherent possession suffix. 7(11.50)NoG

‘The workers suggested opening the shop every Sunday.’7The translation of the matrix verb plus its complement in (11.50) could be either ‘...suggested opening it...’
or ‘...suggested that it be open...’ as the nominalized transitive verb can be interpreted to be a VO
nominalization (Associative Construction) or as a nominalized transitive verb in the Attributive
Construction (see Chapter VI). That is, makórasamá can be translated as ‘to open it’ or ‘to be open’, the
latter of which behaves as a predicate nominal.",[400]
"384CHAPTER XII
PARTICIPANT NOMINALIZATION AND RELATIVE CLAUSESIn Gumuz there are a range of possible clause-like structures that can modify head
nouns within NPs. A subset of these modifiers are simply nominalizations, some of
which maintain some of the participants of the nominalized verb. At the other extreme,
other clausal modifiers to a head noun can be fully finite (i.e. non-nominalized). Since
both nominalized and non-nominalized structures can be used to restrict the reference of
nouns, in this chapter I first discuss the structure of participant nominalizations, and then
describe the use of both these and other clausal structures to restrict reference. Most of
these clause-like modifiers combine with a pronominal element, save the most finite
forms in NoG. The role of these left-edge pronominal elements in participant
nominalizations and in relative clauses will also be discussed, their singular-plural
concord, as well as their respective source constructions within Gumuz.
Nonfinite participant nominalizations/relative clauses are quite similar in form
between NoG and SoG, while the more finite relative clause constructions tend to differ
somewhat between the two dialects. NoG and SoG have relative pronouns and
relativizers all of which are identical in form to pronominal elements used in participant
nominalizations. Section 12.1 below describes participant nominalizations and the
pronominal elements found in relative clause constructions. Section 12.2 discusses the
historical sources for the pronominal elements as well as the source constructions for
participant nominalizations. Section 12.3 then discusses the more finite relative clauses.","[413, 414]"
