"Yes/no-questionsare clearlydifferentfromwh-questions(or a-questions, since most Tiriy6 interrogatives start with a): the former are characterized mostly
by rising intonation (cf. 2.5.2), while the latter are distinguished by the presence of an
interrogative word (cf. chap. 8). To illustrate the intonational difference between normal
declarative clauses and a yes/no question, examples(40a-b) from 2.5.2 are repeated as(72a-b) below.

are close to the English word ‘yes’ and ‘no’, but they are not entirely equivalent, since the

Owadisagrees, regardless of the polarity of theis clearly a word, obviously related to the negative particlewa(a); it can also, given the circumstances, mean‘nothing’ or ‘nobody’(45d). Aha,onthe other hand, looks less stable. Its pronunciation can vary from [aha] to [sho], comingsometimes quite close to the agreeing sound usually spelled as ‘m-m’or ‘hm-hm’inEnglish. Notice also that it is possible to find intensifying particles after owa, but not
after aha (e.g. owa_rén, owa_rén_ken ‘Not at all! Never!’, with _rén(ne) ‘truly, genuine’

"However, some general observations, based on the most evident patterns, can already be
made about rheme and word order.
About rheme, it is possible to say, judging by the pattern presented by questions and
answers,that it is associatedwith sentence-initial position. Noticethat interrogatives,ifpresent, always begin the sentence, and that the optimal answers have the unknown element
also at the beginning (94a-b); the question marks indicate answers that were considered
‘possible, but less natural’. Sentence-initial position also seems to be important for focus,
considering that it is occupied by elements that correct wrong presuppositions (94c-d).(94a)—aki

both questions and answers(133a-b). Furthermore,(133b) is the only way to say about abox that it is empty, regardless of whether the speaker opened it to look inside, or justweighed it in his/her hands, or is telling someone else that s/he need not open the box. (But

"2.4.3.1. Vowel sequences. V;V; sequences form tautosyllabic vowel sequences (cf. 2.4.1,
2.5.1) with the syllabic peak falling on the first vowel, V;. There are no vowel sequences
in whichthesyllabicpeakfalls onthe secondvowel(i.e. thereis no[du]vs.[at]distinction).
From the fact that seven vowels can occur in the Vi position and four vowels inthe Vj position, a total of 7 x 4 = 28 (minus 4 VVsequences) = 24 vowel sequenceswould be expected. However, only the following 14 are attested:
(25) Attested vowel sequences./ai/: /nai/ ‘s/he/it is’, /kurairu/ ‘chicken’, /kaiké/ ‘fox (sp.)’, /aimara/ ‘fish (sp.)’

4 KjV/ Sequencies tend to be pronounced as /i.V/ in fast speech, as e.g. /pija_sa/ ‘a little bit’
[pi.ja:.ga]~[pi.a:.sa] (notice that the /a/ is still stressed, showing that there still is a syllable boundary before
it). In slow speech, especially when the word is carefully enunciated, the /j/is consistently pronounced.
'S Given this fact, one might wonder whether sequences of vowel + /i/ and vowel + /u/ should not be
analyzed as vowel + /j/ and vowel + /w/. However, in the absence of any phonological processes
distinguishing these two cases, no principled decision can be made. Descriptively speaking, it seems to be a
question of arbitrary choice to decide whether to increase the set of vowel sequences (which would include
/ael, laol, léel, foe/ anyway), or the set of syllable-final consonants (which already has /h/ and /n/). A similar
situation applies to the analysis of inherently long vowels as underlyingly long, or as sequences of identical
vowels (cf. 1.5.1.1).
'€ There is some variation between /ao/ and /au/ in certain words; one speaker had /jaohpi/ ‘my

a nominal interrogative (‘what?’); this question was said to someone who had come from437

question can no longer be accurately described by that stem. With non-possessed forms,
this usually implies that the referent is a ‘degraded’,‘no longer usable’,‘former’,‘ex-’161
member of the category designated by the stem (1la-d). The ‘former’, ‘ex-’ meaning is
compatible with pronouns (lle-f). With possessed forms, the ‘old’, ‘no longer usable’
meaning is still possible, but a more frequent interpretation is that of past possession, i.e.
something which used to belong or be related to the possessor. In this case, the word still
designates a member of the category in question; it is its relation to its possessor that is no
longer valid ((11g-i), with ji- ‘first person’). With a proper noun, the usual interpretation
is ‘old’, ‘no longer existent’, ‘the one which used to be’ (cf. (11j), which was said of aphotograph of an old village, Araraparu, which was abandoned several decades ago).(lla)

"Jahpénté has the -nté ‘beneficiative’ verbalizer (cf. 5.3.3.1.2) on the noun jahpé,
which can be used to refer to any of the things necessary for everyday life: food, clothes,
utensils,firewood,artifacts,hammocks,etc. Its originalmeaning—andstill itsmostfrequent one—is then ‘provide O with things’, ‘make O’s life possible by giving him/herall the necessary things’. A question that foreigners often hear after they come to a Tiriyé
village is: eeke anja mi-jahpénté-n? ‘How are you going to help us?’, ie. ‘What are you
going to provide us with (in return for your stay here and our collaboration)?’. Old men
hope that their children will jahpénté them in their old age. In a story, a young man
promised to an older one: é-jahpénté-keh-pin_me w-eh-ta-e ‘I will never stop helping

a question of degree. Thus, there are some adverbs and postpositions which can have

"Asanexample,let us considerwaaré‘Cognoscitive’.‘objectless’adverbial form waaré, without any prefix, meaningIt hasa derived‘understandable’. Thisform is analogous to the non-possessed form of a noun. Compare the behavior of waaré

accept and use the form without i-, it is far less frequent than the form with i- (cf. 10.2.3
on postpositional phrases). This state of affairs is indicated with a parenthetical question
mark (?). To indicate this fact, an underscore character in parentheses will be written

"Forinstance, if a certain morpheme of doubtful status can be separated from the preceding (or
following) word by a clearly independent element (e.g. a particle), then the morpheme in
question is not an affix, but a clitic. Thus, the particle _pa ‘Repetitive’, which was shownto be a clitic on account of its sentence-level distributional constraints ((1-2) above), can
also be separated from the preceding noun by other particles, such as _pité ‘for a second’:(8)pata_po_pité_pa
k-ei-ne
village_Loc_a.sec_Rpt 1+2-Cop-Hort
‘Let us be/stay in the village again a little (and then go do something else).’Separability is the main argument for treating _hpe ‘Indefinite’ as a particle rather
than a suffix occurring on interrogatives.(9c) showsthe identificational interrogativeaano ‘which’ followed by a noun, with _hpe occurring at the end (a combination such as

follow (or precede)morphemesfrom different lexical classes (nouns, verbs, adverbs,postpositions, etc.). In this respect, clitics tend to be freer than affixes (though classcrossing affixes do exist; cf. 3.3); thus, _pa can follow a verb or a noun, as in (1), another

“They brought me here at some date, I don’t know when.’Formally speaking, interrogatives have the interesting characteristic of beginningwith the vowel a. Much like English interrogatives are often mentioned as ‘wh-words’,
one could speak of Tiriy6 interrogatives as a-words. The one exception, eeke ‘how?’ (aswell as the historically related eekammao‘when?’), apparently comesfrom an earlier433
*aeke (cf. Meira 1998a:71ff). Tiriyd seems to be the only known Cariban language inwhich (almost) all interrogatives start with a. Meira 1998a reconstructs &-initial forms for
the nominalinterrogatives(*éti,*éniki),and explainsthe initial a as the result ofanalogy, with aano ‘which?’ as the probable source. Older adverbial interrogatives were
replaced by combinations of aano with simple spatial postpositions (e.g. *aano_po‘inwhich one?’ > an-po ‘where?’)
In spite of their common characteristics, interrogatives do show different (nominal
or adverbial) morphological properties. For instance, the (nominal) animate interrogative
aki has a collectiveform aki-ja(mo),exemplifiedin (4a) (cf. Spansih¢quién?andéquiénes?), which is not true for any of the adverbial interrogatives. Conversely,the(adverbial) non-spatial interrogative eeke ‘how’ has a nominalized form eeka-no(4b),with the adverbial/postpositional nominalizer -no (cf. 4.2.2.2), while none of the nominal
interrogatives can even be nominalized. (4c) has the nominalized form of anpée‘wherefrom’.!(4a)aki-jann-ee-ja-n ?wh.An-Col 3S,4-come-Prs.Ipf-Dbt

“What (kind of thing) is this?’“Where are you from, man?’(Lit. you are someone from where?)t Unfortunately, such differences are only known to exist for aki, eeke and anpée. Presumably, the othernominal and adverbial interrogatives pattern with either aki or eeke, but no collective forms for ati ‘what?’
and aano ‘which?’ or nominalized forms of atitoome ‘why?’, ahtaaré ‘how many/much?’, anpo

‘who?interrogatives. There are only three interrogatives in this category, aki(animate)’, ati ‘what (inanimate)’, and aano‘which?’. The first two, aki and ati,instantiate the same animacy distinction that was observed for demonstrative pronouns(cf. 4.1.2).
Aki is used to ask about any animate being, human or animal. For instance, (5a) is
a possible (and quite frequent) question to ask someone who is coming back home from a
hunting expedition; a Westerner who is tempted to translate the interrogative with ‘who?’
is, at first, quite bewildered. (5b) can be used to ask who someone is, but it can also be a
question about an animal (e.g. if the speaker does not knowwhat a certain animal iscalled). Interestingly, it is possible to use aki to ask about the animate possessor of the
word eka ‘name’ (5d); this is not true for other inanimate-referent words (Se).(5a)aki

(b) On verbs, this morphemereciprocal,and middle(e-tuukasemantics,is the only marker for the area defined by reflexive,all the wayfrom prototypicaldirect reflexive cases‘hit oneself / each other’) to all the middle cases listed in Table 5.7. No othermarkers of e.g. reflexivity were found, nor do there seem to be morphosyntactic tests that
can distinguish ‘more reflexive’ from ‘more middle’ uses of the detransitivizer.
(c) The morpheme in question is a detransitivizer in that all verbs on which it was
found seem to be fully intransive and to have transitive counterparts. There were no cases
in which it occurred on verbs that remained transitive (i.e. capable of taking an overt O
participant, such as e.g. Latin hortor ‘exhort’), or on an originally intransitive stem (i.e. like
Old Norse grgnask ‘become green’, or Spanish caerse ‘fall disastrously’, irse ‘go away’).”!
Moreover,‘emphatic’ situations, in which reflexive or middle markers often occur withoutaffecting the valence of the verb (e.g. English‘she did it herself’), do not contain thedetransitivizer in Tiriy6 (adverbs such as éikaré ‘by oneself’, ‘without help’, or particles
like _ré ‘exactly’, are used instead).","[280, 281]"
"167event itself and for nuclear and peripheral participants; furthermore, for every ‘targeted’
element,there usuallyis morethan onenominalization,the differencebetweenthembeing their degree of specificity or ‘actuality’. For instance, there are, for transitive verbs,
two A-nominalizations(cf. 10.1.3 for the labels A, O and S, inspired by Dixon1979, ):one, glossed as ‘A.act’, describes an actual A participant in a real situation with a well-defined,
other,actual O participant (‘hunter of something’,glossedas‘A.pot’,describesa potential A‘teacher of someone’),
participantwhile thein a less well-definedsituation, with a generic O participant (‘someone who bunts, who can hunt, who is good
at hunting’, “someone who teaches, who can teach, who is good at teaching’).
Table4.4 lists the variousverbal nominalizersaccordingto their transitivityrestrictions. Table 4.5 lists them according to their participant- or event-orientedness. The
-to(-no) nominalizer, which can still be synchronically analyzed as the nominalized formof -té ‘potential A adverbializer’ (cf. 6.2.2.1, 4.2.2.1), is included in order to fill a gap in
the semantic field in question. All affixes listed here are totally productive within their

work, since the nouns in questions are not possessed (24c-k). These instances provide
evidence for an independent postposition _htao, conveying the idea of ‘being surrounded’
by the object: in (24j),Iam among the Wayana; in (24d), the meat is in direct contactwith the surrounding fire (which is not the case for the stew in (24f), hence the use of adifferent postposition); in (24k), being ‘in the forest’ can be seen as being ‘surrounded by
theforest’*pata_htao,(noticethat‘inthevillage’,‘on theisland’arepata_po,pau_po,not*pau_htao, i.e. if the area is small enough to look more like a point than a‘surrounding’, _htao is not used); even in (24c), the stone is ‘surrounded by’ the garden
(cf. (24h), in which _po puts the stone “by’ or ‘close to’ the garden; notice that _po wouldbe used if the speaker weretalking about a humanbeing rather than a stone). Thespeakers who were consulted could not distinguish (24e) from (24g); but this may be
because the difference between being ‘surrounded’ by the ground and being ‘placed on it’
(as ‘on a table’, in (24a) above) is not very noticeable. It is interesting to note that it wasnot possible to use _htao with one of the words for ‘table’, taafara (a borrowing,
ultimately from Dutch tafel ‘table’): *taafara_htaowascorrected to taafara_po(24a) above) or taafara_juuwé. Notice also the contrast between nono_tao

consider them inflectional (marking e.g. ‘translational inflection’) and the less productive,
more irregular class-changers derivational. This is certainly a point at which linguists of
different theoretical orientations would disagree. However, for expository purposes, it is
simpler to be able to speak of class-changing morphology(nominalizers, verbalizers,adverbializers)section,as a whole,and to describe them in the sameregardless of thelevel of productivity and regularity of specific processes. Thus, in general, when a group

Certain other similarities verge the ‘morphemic’ barrier, and it may be a question
of taste to decide whether a borderline case is a non-productive morpheme or a formative
(e.g. the ‘directional’, ‘locative’ and ‘perlative’ final syllables, -wé/-o, -(ka) and -e, in thespatial postpositions [cf. 7.3.1]). A certain amount of arbitrary subjectivity is unavoidable
here.

At first sight, the lack of most phrasal properties suggests that these sequences of
nouns should be analyzed as being in apposition. According to this analysis, (33a) would
really mean‘the woman, the tall one, she is coming’; examples such as (33d-e) would thensimply be cases in which one of the two terms in apposition was displaced for pragmatic
reasons (e.g. as an afterthought). However, certain details already suggest that the situation
may be alittle more complex than that: the absence of obvious pauses between the twonouns in (33a-b), and the possible placement of a second-position particle after the second
noun in (33g). In addition, consider the following examples,involving the postposition_pé(ké) ‘about’:(34a)wéri

When wéri ‘woman’ and kawéno ‘tall one’ occur together and are followed by the
postposition _pé&(ké), they refer to the same entity, ‘the tall woman’;the insertion of apause (34c) modifies this, shifting the interpretation in the direction of two separate entities.
If wéri and kawéno are separated by the verb, their propensity for coreferentiality is greatly
reduced, which is indicated by the question mark preceding the coreferential interpretationin (34d-e). It is much easier to interpret the ‘afterthought’ as referring to the person who is
talking (the S participant) than to the woman.","[546, 547, 548]"

or not the event is taking place. It is thus the right form for questions (91la-d) and with
dubitative particles such as tahke(ne)‘maybe’, or _mo‘irrealis’ (9le-f). Certainty formsare used when the event leaves no doubts in the speaker’s mind (91 g-h). In these cases, itdoes not seem that the speaker is trying to specify the source of his information concerningthe event, but rather to clarify doubts about it. For instance, in (91c), the speaker and the314
hearer are hunting together, so the speaker has obvious visual evidence that the hearer is
trying to shoot at something; he simply misses one piece of information, viz. the intended
target. The same is valid for (91d), where both speaker and hearer are going together to aneighboring village, but the speaker does not know the particular shortcut that the hearer istaking. Therefore, the Tiriy6 suffixes -e and -(né)/-(ne) apparently do not carry evidential
(i.e. information source) meaning; rather, they concern how the speaker feels about his/herlevel of knowledge of the situation.(91a)kure man-a-n ?

does not consider to be real or factual:hypotheses(‘If I had moretime, I would...’),statements of disbelief (“What? Are you joking?’), or warnings (‘It may happen! Watchout!’).

elaborate in Tiriyd, as in most Cariban languages. There is a more general verb, éewe(ti)
‘eat, consume/ingestfood’, whichis the detransitivized form of ewe(ti)‘feed O’. In598
addition, there are five different transitive verbs which are used according to the kind offood being consumed. A possible way of referring to these kinds of food is to use the
potential O nominalizer (t- -se(mi); cf. 4.2.2.1.2) to derive nounsfrom the respectiveverbs; however, Tiriy6 already has ‘generic terms’ for kinds of food, most of which
apparently unrelated to the respective verb; they are among the candidates for potential
“gentive classifiers’ discussed at the end of Sec. 11.5.1.3.
Table 11.6 summarizes the vocabulary items in question.","[617, 618, 619]"

oraresoundsequences not otherwise found in the language, and some of them seem

more conventionalized than interjections; they occur in constructions with the
Sa verb stem Ka ‘say’ with lexical meaning (‘sneeze’, ‘drizzle’, ‘joke’, etc.; cf.",[463]
"A still (but not so clearly) related meaning of this verb is that of ‘imitating’: taripi
wi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate a taripi, a capuchin monkey’, said someone who was
about to entertain his friends by mimicking a Cebus apella. This can be said about people
as well: waijana wi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate a Wayana’, and also, waijana i-jomi
wi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate the Wayana language’. Interestingly, the Tiriy6é always
use the verb ku(ku) to refer to the capacity of speaking a foreign language; it is as thoughthe only language that one really speaks is one’s own mother tongue, while all the other
languages that one might know are ‘imitated’, no matter how well or fluently. Waijana i-602
jomi mi-kuu-ja-n ? ‘do you speak the Wayana language?’, a Tiriy6 may ask one of his
friends. I-kuh-ké_pité ! ‘imitate it a little bit!’, i.e. ‘speak some of it (so that we can hear
what it sounds like)’, he say after an affirmative answer: the Tiriy6, like most Amerindiangroups, are often curious about the languages of other people.

meanings of ku(ku).","[622, 623]"
"They are obviouslyderived from eta ‘bank, margin’ and enpata ‘face’. Etae is a true perlative, and describes
motion along e.g. a river bank (41a), and presumably also along other objects that have
edges or rims; unlike _tae, it cannot be used if the speaker is in a canoe. Empatae, on theother hand, is a locative; its few attestations were descriptions of the position of a certain
house (41b), which was located on a hill slope. This may be interpreted as a metaphor
based on seeing the slope as the ‘face’ of the hill, which agrees with the use of (_)rehté,from reti ‘horns, antlers, top of the head’ (cf. next section), for a house located on the topof the hill.(41a)tunaetae

unknown origin. _Rehté means, as its source might have indicated, ‘on top of somethinground, head-like. (42a) describes a stone that is on top of an upside-down hemispheric
gourd; (42b) refers to a house which is on the top of a hill (cf. the previous section, 41b,for a comparison with enpatae‘on the slope of’). When used with a person-markingprefix, _rehté refers to the head of the person in question (42c). The expression in (42d),
literally ‘it’s on top of it’, means ‘it’s noon’; presumably, it refers to the sun being ‘on top
of thesky’(whichcanbeseenasa head,oranupside-downgourd).(42e)hasadirectional example.(42a)tépu-pisi_n-ai

‘S/he/it fell on top of my head.’The basic meaning of _pohté is ‘ahead of’, or ‘in the front part of’. For instance,
(43a) places an object (the Figure) either in the front part of a canoe (e.g. a passenger
sitting in the prow), or ahead of it (e.g. a fish in the river, right in front of the canoe).
Notice that, since a canoe has an obvious front-back asymmetry, _pohté cannot refer to a
Figure placed in its back (in which case, (_)hpitinao would be used); but, in the case ofan object without such an asymmetry,_pohtécan refer to a Figure placed at either409
extremity (e.g. (43b) may refer to a stone placed close to either extremity of the stick).","[428, 429, 430]"
"APENDIX B. Preliminary Tiriyé-English Dictionary.
“Dictionaries are like watches: the worst
is better than none, and the best cannotbe expected to go quite true.”
SAMUEL JOHNSONThis preliminary dictionary contains all stems attested in the available corpus,
except for the doubtful cases (e.g. apparent mistranscriptions, unanalyzed words, etc.).
Every entry contains the stem, in boldface (reducing syllables are in parentheses; irregularity markers, like [t] = t-adding (5.1.3), (j) = j-adding (4.3.1.4.2), and [mi] = irregularmi stems (5.1.4), are not considered in the alphabetic ordering: (j)akéreu is under A,
etc.),followedby grammaticalinformation(wordclass,class-changingpossibilities,irregularities) in parentheses, using the same abbreviations as the grammar sections. The
main body of the entry explains the meaning(s) of the stem, with examples. If the stem is
discussed in the grammar,the section numberis given in parentheses. If the variousmeanings are related but clearly distinguishable, each is preceded by a number in boldface
(1, 2, etc) in the body of the entry. Additional comments, possible etymologies and relations to other stems are given at the end, in square brackets.

“My father; gave money to my friend in his; house.’A related question is whether, among the uses of _:ja, there are instances that are
differentenoughto begivena separatestatusasanindependentrole(‘dative’)orgrammatical relation (‘indirect object’). Uses like (18c) and (19), and maybe even (18d),
might be good candidates for this status. But are there any morphosyntactic properties that
distinguish these uses from others? The absence of features such as dative shift, or specialdative pronouns,and the ambiguity of sentenceslike (20a-b),which was interpreteddifferently by different speakers, seems to argue against that.(20a)(bo)piréu w-ekarama-po

“‘His/her father; gave his; knife (to someone).’“(S/he); gave his/her; knife to his/her; (=someone else’s) father.’However, two reasons in favor of treating the ‘dative’ cases of _:ja as independent
can be mentioned:514
(a) the nominalized form of _:ja apparently has only the dative meaning (21a);
(b) although no nominalizations exist that correspond to a ‘dative’ participant, thereare verbalizing processes (the ‘beneficiative’ suffixes mentioned in 5.3.3.1.2) that generate
transitive stems with ‘dative’ objects; compare (21b) and (21c). O-oriented nominalized
forms of these verbs (21d-e) can be used to refer to these ‘datives’ (they are, in fact, the
only way to build relative clauses referring to them; cf. 10.4.1.3.2).(21a)Témeta_ja-no_ro

“The one who was given a house.’The interesting point about ‘beneficiative’ verbs such as (2lc) is that no other
peripheral participant has a corresponding ‘specialized’ verbalizing suffix; in fact, even the
other uses of _:ja (‘causee’, ‘A participant’, ‘directional’) do not correlate with anythingS15similar. Based on these facts, a category of ‘Dative participant’ can be distinguished, albeit
less ‘sharply defined’ in Tiriy6é than the nuclear participants (A, O, $).°10.2. Phrases. With the criteria (‘symptoms’ is probably a better label) described in 10.3,
three kinds of phrases can be proposed:noun phrases, verb phrases and postpositionalphrases. Certain groups of words have an ambiguous behavior: they tend to obey certain
constraintsandshowsomesymptomsofphrasalstatus,butnotalways,andnotconsistently. In the following sections, the three kinds of phrases are described, with the
ambiguous cases being compared to the phrase that they most resemble.","[534, 535, 536]"
