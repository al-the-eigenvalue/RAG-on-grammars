DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND W O R D H O O D IN NIVKHAfter having studied the morphophonemics characteristic of Nivkh, the crucial questions
to explore are (i) which status do the entities in which we observed these mechanisms
have? and (ii) which morphological type does Nivkh exhibit? The first question can be
reformulated in the following way: Are the complexes single words? The answer to this
question is of course the basis for any discussion about the morphological type. It is,
however, not easy to determine, and constitutes a topic carefully avoided in grammatical
sketches of Nivkh after a first dispute on it ended without agreement between the parties.
We will therefore proceed to study the evidence for the morphological status of Nivkh
complexes.
3.1
The old dispute
The question of wordhood in Nivkh was first raised by Krejnovič (1934, 1937) and was
discussed in the 1950s and 1960s by the two Russian 'Nivkhologists' Krejnovič and
Panfilov in a series of articles dealing with ""incorporation in Nivkh"" (Krejnovič 1958,
1966;Panfilov 1954,1958,1960a, 1963,1966). Their dispute prompted phonetic experi­
ments carried out by Bondarko & Zinder (1962), but did not lead to any agreement.
Panfilov's position, as it emerges from his articles and his grammar (1962:2533, 1965:23-30), is based on a morphosyntactic and semantic argumentation. Although
he does not contest the ""tight phonological units"" in Nivkh, pointed out by Bondarko
and Zinder (1962; their results will be taken up below), he considers these phonological
properties first not to be sufficient ( 1960a), later not to be decisive (1963:157), and final­
ly not even to be relevant (1965:27-28) for the recognition of word units. The word, in
his view, is neither a phonologically nor a morphologically defined entity, but a lexicogrammatical unit (1963:27-28). As such, he continues, it is characterized, in contrast to
morphemes and components of compounds, by having a relatively autonomous meaning,
by being a member of a paradigm, and by contracting syntactic relations with other parts
of a sentence; and it is characterized by a semantic and syntactic integrity in contrast to
what he calls 'word unions'. His 'word unions' are our complexes of modifier + head
and undergoer + verb, which undergo consonant alternation as described in chapter 2.
The complexes are thus, in his view, loose syntactic concatenations of free words by
means of sandhi and do not form a single word unit together (1966:62-63). Evidence for
the independence of the parts of a complex are, according to Panfilov, the facts that each
part of the complex preserves its lexical semantics, that each part is inflectable and
focusable (but see section 3.8.1), and that it can bear a syntactic relation to an element in
the sentence outside the complex, e.g. to an adverb, another 'direct object' or modifier,
or any other constituent. Furthermore, Panfilov claims that the elements of a complex
need not be adjacent and that there can be, as he puts it, more than one modifier,66DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHmodified, direct object or verb, i.e. in the case of coordination. In the cases of both nonadjacency and coordination, Panfilov goes on, a form occurring outside a complex has
the same form and function as the corresponding form inside, and he postulates that
identical forms have identical status. From this he concludes that the components of a
complex are not roots or stems, but free words, and that the phenomenon in question
therefore can be neither incorporation nor composition (1960a).
These arguments will be treated in detail in this chapter as they require minute
exposition in order to be made comprehensible. Suffice it here to say that Panfilov's ar­
gumentation suffers from methodological shortcomings instigated by a strict structuralis­
tic and largely Russocentric approach.
Compounds do exist in Nivkh, as Panfilov shows (1958), and he is of the opi­
nion that they express single lexical meanings and concepts, that any component prece­
ding another one may not be inflected (but see section 3.8.1), and that none of their parts
may be focused separately. Panfilov does not present further formal differences between
complexes and compounds, and does not discuss consonant alternation at the compoundinternal morpheme boundary. Incorporation, as he understood it in accordance with the
then-valid doctrine of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, is characterized by the compo­
nent parts preserving their lexical semantics and their mutual syntactic relations within
the incorporation unit, but having a different form from their free occurrence, losing
their independent word status and forming one morphological word together, as eviden­
ced, for instance, by vowel harmony, consonant alternation, etc. (1960a: 51). Further­
more, they do not contract relations to parts of the sentence outside the incorporating
unit; in other words, Panfilov postulates that an incorporated noun may not be modified
by an attribute outside of the noun-verb complex (the concept of stranding is not known
to Panfilov).
For him, any paradigmatic noun form and any paradigmatic verb form are free
word forms because they can occur as such in a sentence (Panfilov does not discriminate
between categories in this respect, see also chapter 6.1) and because all allomorphs of
one morpheme must have the same morphological status. There cannot be both free and
bound forms of one morpheme in one paradigm (1966). In particular, Panfilov considers
the suffixless attributive form of the verb in the Amur dialect to be a participle and a free
form. This claim is based primarily on treating the suffixless Amur form as equivalent to
the attributive form in the Sakhalin varieties, which has a suffix and is therefore consi­
dered to be a participle, because the Sakhalin participle ending is represented by the
nasal which has elided on the Amur (see chapter 2.3). In the Amur variety, however, the
attributive form is formally identical to the verb root (see chapter 2.4.1), and thus no par­
ticiple form exists.
Panfilov further deduces the free-form status of the attributive form from his
erroneous claim that the finite ḍ-form, which doubtless is a free form, is used as an attri­
bute in the same way his so-called 'participle' (suffixless attributive form) is, a claim
which he believes is proven by the following example.","[75, 76, 77]"

complex. The integration of question words (parallel to the noun + verb complex), which

tioned, but instead remains intact.

a.",[236]
"DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD91In the question in (38c), the waveform shows a greater amplitude in the verbal element
stretch. This may be influenced by the question enclitic, which has the greatest ampli­
tude in the complex. The emphatically lengthened vowel in (38f) also has a conspicuous­
ly high amplitude, which fits in nicely with Panfilov's observation that emphatic leng­
thening attracts stress (see above).
As is obvious from sentences (38a), (38b), and (38e), all exhibiting a structure
not represented in Bondarko & Zinder's sample, amplitude is greater for the verb root
than for the noun root in attributive verb + noun complexes. This leads us to suspect that
stress falls on the attributive verb, which is confirmed by the auditive impression.
In the fundamental frequency plots (the 'pitch contours'), which suggest the
location of stress, there are visible stretches in all plots which start around 220 to 250 Hz
and drop to around 140 Hz. In some of these stretches, fundamental frequency decreases
rather continuously: mer-umgu-k'ezḍ ""told our woman"" (possessor + undergoer noun +
verb), ţaq-xir ""with a trident"", q otr-t'ər-lovř-ţevḍ ""stabbed the bear in its left armpit"" (a
rather large complex containing a possessor, an attribute, the undergoer noun and the
verb), imŋ-k'imḍ ""gave them"" (undergoer and ditransitive verb), ţaq-mi-fiḍ ""is lying in its
cradle"" (noun + relational morpheme + local transitive verb), řaŋzlu ţo-voḍ ""took some
fish"" (copredicate + undergoer-verb complex). In others, fundamental frequency first
rises to some extent, then drops. The latter behavior is true of subjects (Vagun, aŋa
""who"", vo-ñlami ""half the village"" (nominal possessor + noun), maţkilk-ōla ""small
child"" (attribute + noun), ţo-ŋəŋ-ñivy-ux ""from the fisherman"" (inflected compound
noun)) and discourse markers (haŋan ""then""), as well as of amra-qauḍ ""has no taste""
and ţaj-ra-ja ""drink tea!"" (undergoer + verb). These stretches of a recurring fundamen­
tal-frequency contour (which we perceive as pitch contour units) are thus highly charac­
teristic in that they end in an extreme section and always start anew at the same medium
height. In other words, pitch contour units are formed by discourse markers (like haŋan
""then""), the subject complex (e.g. Vagun, maţkilk-ōla ""small child"", tuzyət-ţaj ""cooled
down tea""), the undergoer-verb complex (mer-umgu-k'ezḍ ""told our woman"", q'otr-t'ərlovř-ţevḍ ""stabbed the bear in its left armpit"", ţaq-mi-fiḍ ""is lying in its cradle""), and also
compounds (amra-q'auḍ ""has no taste"", ţo-ŋəŋ-ñivy-ux ""from the fisherman""), which
may become quite complex as well. The spontaneous utterance is no different than the
ones read from the cards.
Somewhat less clear are ku-ena-umgu ""that other woman"" (determiner +
attribute + noun) with an unexpected rise at the end, hays-ku-fχojḍ-ŋa ""is washing the
clothes?"" (inflected undergoer noun + verb), and dlf-yo verax-ko ""servants and slaves""
(coordinated nouns), which all lack an overall falling contour. In the question in (38c),
frequency starts decreasing in the predicate, but then rises to over 350 Hz in the question
enclitic; the whole contour is obviously influenced by the question intonation at its end.
Interestingly, fundamental frequency decreases in the roots of the two coordinated nouns
in (37d), but the coordinating associative morphemes display level frequency as a sort of
additional phonological marker of coordination. Thus, an overall principle of stretches
characterized by a falling pitch contour seems to be justifiable and applies to all three
structural types of complexes, noun + noun, noun + verb, and verb + noun.","[101, 102]"

"The case of coordination nicely supports the general principle of complex formation in
Nivkh: only adjacent constituents in a dependent-head relation synthesize. Coordinated
forms, however, are not in a dependent-head relation to each other. We therefore should
not expect synthesization.
Coordination is different from other cases of non-synthesization as there is still
a noun + verb complex (with the last coordinated undergoer). Syntactic mechanisms and
pragmatic reordering of constituents in the sentence result in the complete dissolution of
the complex, i.e. undergoer and verb are two separate and usually non-adjacent consti­
tuents, as we will see. In this situation, the transitive verb, for which a reflex of its under­
goer is obligatory, takes a 3s undergoer prefix or (if it is single obstruent initial) appears
in its fricative-initial allomorph. A noun which is 'excorporated' from a primary objectverb complex never triggers a bound allomorph or an alternated initial sound of the verb.
Thus, there are then two elements in the sentence referring to one and the same partici­
pant, the undergoer. The important question arising from this situation concerns the ar­
gument and referentiality status of the elements referring to that participant. Remember
that the undergoer prefix is obligatory in the absence of a nominal undergoer synthesi­
zing to the verb, but mutually exclusive with this nominal undergoer in the undergoer
slot of the verbal template. This question will be discussed in chapter 5.
4.4.1
Word order permutation
The usual word order in Nivkh is, as was shown in chapter 1.3.7,
(125)topic - embedded clause _ adverbials ~ subject_ causee _ secondary
object_ primary object-predicateConstituents are permuted for three reasons: they may either be moved into the topic po­
sition, dislocated, or focused. Generally this is possible for central and peripheral partici­
pants as well as adverbials; we are concerned here with the undergoer or primary object.
A topic is understood to be the constituent in the leftmost position of a sentence,
dislocated from the simple clause, and the participant which is established as the predica­
tion base about which the rest of the sentence makes a predication (see Sasse 1987).
Focus is used in the sense of Dik et al. (1981) here.
The following examples show an undergoer in the topic position. The topic is
not case marked, but may bear scalar operators.",[166]
"TABLE 1.3: Nivkh relational morphemes
Scalar operator suffixes and focus suffixes, which are next in the template, are two cate­
gories which are not differentiated nor addressed in detail in the extant Nivkh grammars.
Their allomorphs are triggered by the final sound of the preceding inflectional suffix in
the same way allomorphs of other inflectional suffixes are. They are mutually exclusive
in the final slot of the nominal word form, but are distinct categories. We will return to
this distinction in chapters 3.8.1,4.3, and 8.3. Suffice it here to say that (i) up to two sca-INTRODUCTION11lar operators may be chained, while at most one focus suffix occurs in a noun form, and
(ii) focus suffixes never occur within a word complex, only at its right edge. Both scalar
operators and focus suffixes, however, may also be marked on adverbial particles, as in
nav-at ""just now"", ñřak-veřk ""only once"" (cf. Gruzdeva 1997b: 169), and on converbs
(for examples see Krejnovič 1934:216). The scalar operators are shown in table 1.4:
-an""also""-park ~ -vark ~ -bark""only""-para ~ -vara ~ -bara""still, yet""-ti ~ -ri ~ -di (A), -ţiŋ ~ -ziŋ ~ -diŋ (ES)

negation focus-aqr ~ -""even"" (topical)• ~ -aχr ~ -ār ~ -ar-avr ~ -uvr ~ -əvr""maybe""TABLE 1.4: Nivkh scalar operators
These suffixes fit into the category which König (1991) has termed 'focus particles', but
in order to prevent possible confusion with the Nivkh focus suffixes, a distinctive term
has been chosen here.
The focus suffixes (table 1.5) encode focus values as established by Dik et al. (1981).

"34DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHThus a complex is a synthetic unit consisting of at least one head constituent and one
dependent constituent. The basic complexes may be enlarged by recursively substituting
a simple dependent (noun or verb form) for a complex one of which the same category
is the head. The verb + verb construction will be treated separately in chapter 6; the other
types are described in detail in chapters 2, 3, 4 and 8.
Although modifier+modified and object+verb coalescence has already been
identified by Krejnovič and Panfilov, who discussed the status of the construction with
respect to incorporation (see chapter 3.1), the phenomenon has not been systematized,
the pervasiveness of the principle within Nivkh grammar has never been treated in any
detail, and the question of its syntactic and typological relevance has not been settled.
The present study tries to fill these gaps.
I will now proceed to the prerequisites for the recognition of complexes, namely
Nivkh phonology and morphophonemics.","[44, 45]"
"152DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHIn (113), the interrogative is adjacent to the verb but does not synthesize: it may not do
so because of the focus marking it bears (the interrogative suffix) and accordingly, the
verb bears the 3su prefix. At the same time, the interrogative suffix on the interrogative
pronoun signals that only the undergoer is questioned, while the verb is topical.

"219With respect to the last point, we can specify that nominal material is integrated in the
form of lexical noun roots (not affixes like in Quileute or Spokane) into a lexical verb
form (and that noun roots are not verbalized as in Eskimo) which corresponds to
Drossard's type C3, represented by Takelma and Chukchi.
The peculiarity of Nivkh within this classification, however, is that whereas
some of the necessary categories are encoded via non-root bound morphemes on the
verb, it is the basic structural principle of dependent-head synthesis which chiefly contri­
butes to the complexity of a Nivkh verb form through the integration of lexical roots,
whether they represent nominal material (undergoers in the case of Nivkh) or adverbial
material (manner or location). The question is whether this structural principle is an in­
stance of polysynthesis or of something different.
We will return to this point in the last chapter, after an examination of Nivkh
nominais. As polysynthesis is understood to be a phenomenon rotating around the verbal
complex only, dependent-head synthesis stands out against it as being operative in the
nominal complex as well.",[230]

a. ""place where the eagle nests""
b. ""eagle's eyrie""This means that such a word is systematically ambiguous between a lexicalized form and
an ad hoc formation. This phenomenon has been described for a polysynthetic language,
Cayuga (Iroquoian), by Sasse (1993). He points out that the lexicalized forms
(71)(Sasse 1993:207)
kaotan hkwih
ehyátohkhwa 'a. ""it habitually carries logs""

b. ""pencil""are forms frozen from different inflectional paradigms in their (b) reading which exist
alongside their productively formed non-lexicalized source (a) (1993:207,213). The nor­
mal inflectional form which translates as ""it habitually carries logs"" does not necessarily
refer to horses.
The morphological evidence thus does not suggest any fundamental difference
between complexes and compounds in Nivkh, in particular with respect to wordhood.
3.8.2 The diachronic perspective
In addition to these criteria, there is an interesting diachronic perspective opened up by
Austerlitz. In several papers (1959a, b, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1990a, b, 1994), he
ventures an analysis of synchronic simplex lexical morphemes not as atomic, but as
historically polymorphemic forms. He tries to extract a common root from the phonemic
representations of lexemes belonging to one semantic field on the basis of Nivkh phonotactics, consonant alternations, and extant or assumed derivational morphemes (such as
nominalizing -ř, -ŋ, -q and -ϰ, 1980:79, and -f LOCNML; see also Panfilov 1962:59-62).
To cite some representative and less subtle studies, he observes that the string /ŋa/ ""oc­
curs in over 40 biological, warm-blooded terms"" (1990:28), e.g. ŋa ""animal"", ŋa ţϰ ""foot,
leg"" (ES), ŋaf ""thigh"", ŋasq ""seal's flipper"", ŋaϰ ""milt"", ŋafq ""comrade"", and he lists
several terms having something to do with the sea which begin with /ke/ (1959b:220221), e.g. keřqŋ ""sea"" (< *ke + heŋqŋ ""side""), keϰ ""gull"" (which can be imagined as <

pheme on the basis of the lexical morphemes mi ""center""/ mi-f ""earth"" (with -f LOCNML),112DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHmu ""boat"" (in view of the shape), and nux ""needle"" (1959b:217-218).
An interesting set of examples of his reconstructions centers around the semantic
field ""arm/hand"". Austerlitz offers the following segmentations (simplified):
(72)
(Austerlitz 1980:81)

takñ ""fingernail""
toqñ ""claw""
tomϰ ""elbow""

tom-q
tot
toř-p-ŋ
tu- ñm-ŋ(A) təmk(A) tot ""lower arm""
(A) tuñThe first element (/ta/, /to/, /tu/), which Austerlitz calls the 'starter', refers to the extremi­
ty; the following velar elements /k/ and /q/ he considers to be formants with the meaning
""isosceles shape""; the segment /ñ/ he analyzes as an element meaning ""tapered and poin­
ted""; /t/ as a reduplicated segment; /m/ as a formant meaning ""mobile-joint""; and finally
/k/, /q/, and /ŋ/ as nominal clotures, i.e. nominalizing elements (1980:81-82).
Panfilov (1962:87) adds some more etymologies, e.g. he analyzes məñḑx ""soft
boots"" as composed of məñḑ ""fish skin"" and ki ""footwear"", with the appropriate conso­
nant alternation (*məñḑ-γi), and məx ""bow"" as made up of mu ""boat"" + əx ""end"".
On the basis of this assumed historical segmentability of modern non-transparent
forms, Austerlitz imagines the Nivkh proto-language to be ""something like a class-lan­
guage, with definite slots for specific grammatical and lexical parcels - something like
Nootka"" (1980:83), with Nootka being a polysynthetic Native North American language
(Wakashan), which forms words out of bound morphemes.
As early as 1906, Sternberg, who did extensive field work on Nivkh, pointed out
the greater morphological similarity of Nivkh and Native American languages than of
Nivkh and Ural-Altaic languages. He mentions (1906:138-139)
(i)
the existence of prefixes (which are absent in Ural-Altaic languages),
(ii)
the ""incorporation"" [sic!] of pronouns into nouns and verbs,
(iii)
the existence of nominal classification and numeral classifiers,
(iv)
the derivation of nouns by verbal suffixes,
(v)
the complex verbal inflection,
(vi)
the existence of verbal classifiers, and finally
(vii)
that ""Das direkte Objekt wird in der Form eines reinen Stammes unmit­
telbar vor das Verbum gestellt, mit welchem es eine Einheit bildet, die
der amerikanischen sogenannten Inkorporation sehr nahe steht."" (1906:
139)
[The direct object appears in a bare stem form immediately in front of
the verb, with which it forms an entity reminiscent of incorporation in
American languages].
Unfortunately, Sternberg does not go into detail nor does he cite examples or evidenceDEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD113for his claims. His idea, however, is taken up by Korsakov (1939), who compares the
structure of the 'incorporation' constructions of Chukcho-Kamchadal languages, Nivkh,
and several Native American languages, such as Lakhota, Delaware, Paiute, Nahuatl,
and Yana. He concludes that these languages have different types of complex forms
made up of (i) two noun roots, (ii) an attributive adjective or verb root plus a noun, (iii)
noun incorporation into a verb and (iv) more complex types containing more than two
lexical roots.
The conception of Nivkh words as having been internally complex at an earlier
stage of the language indicates that Nivkh may be similar to the polysynthetic language
system of forming complex words from bound morphemes (see chapters 7 and 10).
3.8.3 The complex in the clause
Turning now to the syntactic behavior of words, Nivkh complexes are permuted in a
clause as wholes, and their rightmost constituent, the head, is inflected for the gramma­
tical categories a simplex lexeme of the same lexical category is. In particular, it is the
only constituent to bear the markers of the obligatory categories of case, mood or converb, which mark the right edge of a complex.
Complexes are also questioned and substituted as wholes. A nominal complex
is questioned with the interrogative pronouns aŋ ""who"", siḑ ""what"", or řaḑ ""which one"",
and can be substituted by the demonstrative pronouns, such as təḑ ""this one"", həḑ ""that
one"", etc. A verbal complex is questioned by jaḑ (~jā- -jaγa-) ""what does s.o./sth. do?""
(for dynamic verbs) or jaʁoḑ ""how is s.o./sth./what is sth. like?"" (for static verbs) and
substituted by haḑ ""s.o./sth. does so"" or toyaḑ, hoγaḑ, etc. ""s.o./sth. is thus"" (see e.g.
Panfilov 1962:255, Otaina 1978:16). The verbal question and substitute forms are verbs
themselves, as their inflectional paradigms show.

the exception of intransitive verbs (expressing value, dimension, color, or quantity) that
incorporate the noun which would be their theme in a clause construction (cf. chapter
2.1). The mechanism as such is productive, as can be seen in a whole series of forms
from a handful of verbs, urɖ ""sth. is good"", qoɖ ""sth. hurts"", pilɖ ""sth. is big"", kәlɖ ""sth.
is long"", verd ""sth. is wide"", ulɖ ""sth. is high"", ţarjɖ ""[pelt] is white"", piuɖ ""[hair/skin]
is black"", tamɖ ""there are a lot"" (cf. Otaina 1978:36-38, 17-23). In addition, intransitive
verbs can incorporate body part nouns. All resulting incorporating forms seem to be lexicalized, as the nominal component cannot be questioned or substituted, which is possible
in noun + verb complexes (cf. Otaina 1978:32; chapter 3.8.3).

there are four such verbalizers in Greenlandic. The Greenlandic case shows that inflec­
tion is not incompatible with derivation and gives rise to the question of whether noun
incorporation may resemble word formation in this respect. Nivkh is less spectacular
than Greenlandic in that case is never integrated into a complex.

"As Hall (1999b: 106-107) shows, however, it suffices for a form to be a possible phono­
logical word in German, i.e. to meet the constraints of a minimal phonological free form,
to be uttered on its own. Such a phonological word need not coincide with a word on the
lexical or morphological level.
(84)German

und
entladen
load_on
and
unload
""to load and unload sth. (with sth.)""In this example, the preverb be- is a minimal phonological free form, but is definitely not
a lexical or morphological word.
Native speakers of German have a feeling for the ambiguous status of the
remnant. When asked how many words Eröffnungs- und Schlußwort are, informants said
three; the explanation for this assessment was: ""because that is the way you write it"".
The third question, whether *Eröffnungs then constitutes a word, prompted hesitation
and finally denial, the informants' explanation being that ""the word is actually/is
abbreviated from Eröffnungswort"" ""opening address"".
Such a clash between phonological and morphological word status could be at
the heart of Nivkh complex splitting under coordination as well (note that we already
distinguished phonological and morphophonological wordhood in 3.7). Evidence for this
assumption is constituted by the behavior of personal prefixes. As we saw above, perso­
nal prefixes are always the leftmost element in a word form and need a host to attach to.
If, for example, a nominal head is modified by two coordinated attributes and is pos­
sessed, the possessor is marked on the first, non-synthesizing attribute, while the second118DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHattribute is marked on the head noun (Krejnovic 1966:40).

no free form, modifies Hemd ""shirt"" in the same way langarm- ""long-sleeved"" does,
with the two modifiers in a coordinate relationship. Only the element -langarm- is
actually compounded with Hemden, forming a single word with it. Marken- and kurzform a single phonological word together which would be ungrammatical as a morpholo­
gical word. The German example contains one further complication not paralleled in the
Nivkh example above: kurz- ""short"" is also related to Arm ""sleeve"", modifying it in the
same way as lang- ""long"" does.
In this light, Panfilov's claim seems to be too strict when he postulates that any­
thing occurring as a free form must be a separate word (morphologically). In addition,
the splitting up of complex word forms does not seem to be a trait unique to Nivkh; and
although it may not be easy to handle for existing linguistic theories, it is stable and does
not block the synthesization of elements. Thus, the problematic splitting up of comple­
xes under coordination does not prove the non-wordhood of Nivkh complexes. Rather,
their behaviors in relation to morphophonemics, stress, inflection, and in permutation
and substitution tests provide strong evidence for the wordhood of complexes in Nivkh.
One tends not to hesitate to recognize word entities as long as bound morphemes
are involved. Their boundedness - the fact that they need a host to attach to - makes
them part of a longer word. It does not matter then how long a chain of bound mor­
phemes actually is, cf. non-polysynthetic agglutinating or polysynthetic languages. In
the case of morphologically compounded forms, i.e. constructions containing mor­
phemes which may otherwise form free words, one tends to be reluctant to identify them
as single words. Also it seems to be tempting to allow oneself to be inspired by the or­
thography of one's own language in determining the status of a compounded construc­
tion in a foreign language.","[128, 129]"

conciliation of diametrically opposed claims with respect to the delimitation of polysyn­
thesis. The classification presented here is, however, still a rough one (for an elaboration
see Mattissen (to appear)); a closer look at the languages classified together shows a
great heterogeneity. Greenlandic, for instance, stands out on account of its derivational288DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHformation of complex words with multiple changes back and forth between the nominal
and verbal category (see chapter 7.3) and by its single inflectional morpheme per word.
Other languages, like Navaho, divide morphemes expressing meanings of apparently one
domain over several different positions. Algonquian languages are known for the three
(at least diachronic) stem positions (see Mithun 1999:339). Moreover, the differences in
the semantic fields expressed by affixes on the verb are manifold. The classification is
meant to show, however, that there are larger structural tendencies which are shared
across continents that allow an assessment of where Nivkh fits into the big picture.
10.3
A wider view of polysynthesis
The study of different aspects of Nivkh morphosyntax has shown how structure is orga­
nized by a consistent principle according to which complex word forms are formed from
the concatenation of nouns and verbs in strictly defined relationships, and that the single
compositional mechanisms resemble or partly overlap with noun incorporation and poly­
synthesis. By just describing them as such, however, the concepts of incorporation and
polysynthesis would have to be broadened, but the general principle behind the mecha­
nisms would still not be grasped.
The comparison of dependent-head synthesis with noun incorporation showed
that tests or criteria of referential activeness and argumenthood of the synthesizing noun,
of polysynthesis, head marking and configurationality do not necessarily apply the way
they are expected to just because the primary object synthesizes with its governing verb
and, as a dependent, is directly marked on its head. This insight suggests that the Nivkh
root concatenation phenomenon should be described in terms of what it actually is, viz.
dependent-head synthesis, and recognized as an organization principle in its own right.
The question then arises of whether this organizational principle, general as it is,
may be found underlying the structure of other languages as well. This, however, cannot
be determined based only on extant materials.
A further question concerns the status of dependent-head synthesis with respect
to polysynthesis. The reconciliation of both structural types is subject to the discrepancy
between the homogeneity of the principle of dependent-head synthesis and the heteroge­
neity of the ingredients and cross-linguistic moldings of polysynthesis. It first has to be
decided how broadly or narrowly polysynthesis is to be interpreted.
The structural parallelisms of Nivkh with Chukchi, Ket, So:ra, Wichita, Nez
Perce, Lakhota, Comanche, Kiowa, and Ainu, besides the differences in the internal
organization of the verb forms and in the role non-root bound morphemes with fairly
concrete, 'lexical' meanings play, lie in the complex verb forms arising from the synthesization of noun and verb roots. Especially between Chukchi and Nivkh, differences
seem to be of degree rather than kind. The parallelism among the languages mentioned
would be veiled by a sharp delimitation of polysynthesis. On the other hand, such a deli­
mitation from non-polysynthetic agglutinating languages by way of minimality con­
straints seems desirable.
For complex noun forms, formed by integrating modifiers such as lexical roots
or non-root bound morphemes in addition to the expected categories of number, case,TYPOLOGICAL OUTLOOK289definiteness or gender, the notion of polysynthesis would have to be enlarged, as sug­
gested in chapter 9. Polysynthesis then would actually assume the status of a separate
morphological type. Complex noun forms, however, exist in otherwise non-polysynthetic languages as well, such as Sanskrit and German, which suggests that they follow a
principle of their own, independent of the verb form. A separate term for this phenome­
non would then be needed.
All the languages mentioned above manifest both complex (polysynthetic) verb
forms and noun forms all of which arise from root concatenation (see chapters 8 and 9;
Spencer 1995, Werner 1997, Rood 1976, Boas/Deloria 1979, Charney 1993, Watkins
1984, Tamura 2000; Nez Perce, however, has non-root bound morphemes only, see Aoki
1970). This means that a uniform formation principle is valid for both verb and noun
forms in these languages (as is the case with Nivkh), which is not taken into account in
the traditional approach to polysynthesis.
Furthermore, a uniform formation principle is found in Greenlandic, Kwakwala,
Tsimshian, and Tariana, in which both noun and verb complexes arise from the affixing
of non-root bound morphemes (see chapter 9; Fortescue 1984; Boas 1911c, 1911b;
Aikhenvald 1999).
Thus, both the compositional and the affixal strategies are not only valid for
both verb and noun forms, but may also apply to both at the same time and thus describe
an overall structural principle of a language.
Such languages stand in contrast to (verbal) polysynthetic languages such as
Karok (Bright 1957:56-57), in which noun forms are barely inflected or derived at all.
Languages such as the latter seem to be a minority, however, since in most polysynthetic
languages examined here nouns (if they can be delimited as a separate lexical category
at all) are not so simple (see chapter 9; in contrast to what Mithun predicts 1988:443). In
fact, no language in the sample lacks number, case, possessive marking or derivational
affixes (such as diminutive or 'tense') altogether, even if these categories are less salient
than in e.g. some European languages (with the exception of English) in disposing of
few or no central cases, in marking collective instead of number or number on animate
nouns only, etc. Nevertheless, the noun form in a polysynthetic language is generally
more simply structured than the verb form if templates are compared, but this applies to
non-poly synthetic languages as well.
It seems to make sense to acknowledge the overall structural principle as a type
in its own right, perhaps even as a morphological type, as it is superordinate to polysyn­
thesis (as it is presently understood). We might call this overall principle polysynthesis,
but in that case the delimitation to verb-only polysynthesis must be reinterpreted.
Leaving these points for further reflection, we close with the final observation
that it is on such a superordinate principle, independent of polysynthesis and operating
on both noun and verb forms, that Nivkh dependent-head synthesis is cast as well.","[298, 299, 300]"

""Aytiil is reading a book""Applying the above-mentioned characterizations to Nivkh, we observe that, because the
Nivkh verb complex is a word unit (see chapter 3) and the integrated noun may be in­
flected (see chapter 4.3), noun stripping and differential object marking may not ad­
equately describe it. Also the verb complex is formed independently of the referential
status of the noun, as we will see below, and does not have a constructional alternative
with a case-marked participant, which excludes differential object marking. It is dis­
solved only for pragmatic reasons (topicalization, focusing, dislocation). Furthermore,
since lexical noun stems and lexical verbs are combined, we have to compare dependenthead synthesis in Nivkh to noun incorporation in the narrow sense of Sapir (1911).
5.1
Parallels of dependent-head synthesis in Nivkh to noun incorporation
In Nivkh noun-verb complexes, a lexical noun stem and a lexical verb stem are com­
bined productively to form one single word, which may be the finite predicate. The noun
represents an undergoer of the verb which is the patient/theme, standard of comparison,
or location of transitive verbs and the goal of some ditransitive verbs (see chapter 4.2.2).
In addition, 'subjects' of intransitive verbs may be incorporated if they are body parts, or
if the verb expresses a quantity, color, value, or dimension (""long"", ""big"", see chapter
4.2.1); they may alternatively be interpreted as locations rather than subjects. Only one
participant at a time forms a complex with its verb. The noun-verb complex may be
paraphrased analytically for pragmatic reasons. Thus far, Nivkh dependent-head synthe­
sis is in line with approaches to incorporation (Sapir 1911; Gerdts 1996; Mithun 1984,
Mithun/Corbett 1999; de Reuse 1994b; Baker 1988). Only Rosen (1989) excludes goal
relations from being incorporated, whereas Hagège (1980) includes them. Neither of
them furnishes details. Goal incorporation is extant, however, for instance in Chukchi
(see Spencer 1995:458, 481), Southern Tiwa (Tanoan; Allen/Gardiner/Frantz 1984),
Kiowa (Kiowa-Tanoan; Watkins 1984:227), and Bininj Gun-wok (Gunwinjguan; see
Evans 1996:73, 75).
Further characteristics are not as easy to decide on. A point of debate which be­
gan with Sapir (1911) is the linguistic level on which incorporation takes place, i.e.
whether incorporation is a morphological, word-formation process (Sapir 1911, Mithun172DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH1984, Mithun/Corbett 1999; Rosen 1989) or a syntactic mechanism (Sadock 1980,1985,
1986; Baker 1988, 1996). The discussion between Mithun and Sadock on this point has
suffered from two shortcomings: first, the idea held by Mithun that morphological for­
mation of word-units implies lexicalization (1984, Mithun/Corbett 1999; see chapter
3.8); and second, the fact that the linguistic traits which motivated the recognition of
incorporation as a syntactic mechanism by Sadock, such as modifier stranding, have
been shown so far to be true only of Greenlandic1, which has denominal verbs only and
no nominal incorporation. Thus the syntactic mechanism postulated by Sadock may be
more adequately ascribed to denominal verb formation and is therefore not necessarily
valid for Nivkh. Compare an example from Japanese, which has denominal verbs as well
as modifier stranding:

Kirei-na hana ""pretty flowers"" is an NP, kirei-na an attributive form only (adverb: kireini, converb: kirei-de), and -darake a non-root bound morpheme deriving a special sub­
class of adjectives (which are themselves a verbal subclass; cf. Mattissen 1995).
On the other hand, it has already been shown in chapter 3.8 for German ad hoc
word formations that word formation does not entail lexicalization (pace Mithun); Majewicz (1980:140) claims that both incorporation and polysynthesis form words ad hoc.
Even Baker (1995, 1996) distinguishes between lexical and syntactic incorporation, al­
though his classificatory criteria lead to conflicting results. So the basic question concer­
ning the level on which incorporation takes place is still undecided. It is even unclear
whether the question is adequately posed in this form. In Nivkh, based on the evidence
presented in chapter 3, the noun and verb synthesize ad hoc on the morphological level
without necessarily being lexicalized.
On the semantic level, a distinction between incorporation denoting ""permanent
or general activity"" and ""predicating a single act"" is made by Sapir (1911:259), a point
which has not been elaborated upon in subsequent incorporation models. Some studies
mention that noun incorporation in their respective languages is used for habitual or
projective events (e.g. Sullivan 1984 on Yucatec Maya, Rigsby 1975:349 on Nass-Gitksan (Tsimshian)); however it seems unreasonable to assume that, in languages where

grams) show a certain correlation to the fundamental frequency plots in their peaks.
Compare the diagrams for hagan ""then"", mer-umgu-k'ezḍ ""s.o. told our woman"", tuz-yətţaj ""cooled down tea"", pq-mi-fiḍ ""s.o. is lying in the cradle"", Vagun, vo-ñlami ""half of
the village"", imŋ-k'imḍ ""s.o. gives them"", as well as the question word aya and the ques­
tion enclitic -ŋa. The string tuz-yət-ţaj ""cooled down tea"" is a nice example.
Fundamental frequency starts at 325 Hz and drops continuously. Intensity also
peaks on the first syllable and never reaches this level again in that string. This is true
mutatis mutandis for the first syllables of the other complexes listed above. Pitch and in­
tensity seem to correlate in marking the stressed syllable in these cases; their peaks,
however, do not necessarily coincide in our diagrams, e.g. in ţoŋsŋñivyux ""from the
fisherman"", q'otr-ţ'ər-lovř-ţevḍ ""stabbed the bear in its left armpit"", and ţaqxir ""with a
trident"".
The spectrograms allow us to identify pausing (in contrast to the waveforms
against background noise). Krejnovič (1979), Jakobson (1971:78) and Watanabe (1992:
185) point out that within a complex, pauses are inadmissible. The spectrograms display
some telling pause units between (exceptionally) black stretches wherever there is no
energy output during a sound chain, e.g. ku-ena-umgu ""that other woman"", containing
determiner, attribute and head noun; pq-mi-fiḍ ""s.o. is inside the cradle"", consisting of
a local transitive verb and its complement, a noun + relational morpheme; ţaj-ra-ja
""drink tea!"", with a monotransitive verb and its patient; and imŋ-k'imḍ, a ditransitive
verb with its recipient. They each have continuous spectrograms just like the compound
ţoŋəŋñivyux ""from the fisherman"".
The individual pause structures of the utterances analyzed here confirm the pitch
contour units we identified above, as there are pauses before each medium fundamental
frequency onset and after each extreme offset.
Hence, there is good evidence for the existence of accentual units in Nivkh that
are also pause units and which are co-extensive with the complexes identifiable on morphophonemic and structural grounds. As accentual and pause units, complexes are no
different in status than inflected forms or compounds.

Nivkh morphophonemic alternations as sandhi
Disregarding the evidence for the wordhood of Nivkh complexes for the moment and
approaching them from the reverse angle, we must examine what else they could con­
ceivably be.
Panfilov considers morphophonemic alternation in Nivkh to be a case of sandhi
between independent words (1966:62). In the current linguistic apprehension, sandhi is
a rather loosely defined term, comprising a wide range of different phenomena, as
Andersen (1986:1-2) and Ternes (1986:11) admit, even including allomorphic alterna­
tion and cliticization. To demonstrate this heterogeneity, a range of phenomena descri­
bed as sandhi in the literature are presented in (39) to (45), to be referenced throughout
this section.","[102, 103]"

"These findings should serve to remove any reservations about the wordhood of Nivkh
complexes.
Having studied different cases of complex nouns cross-linguistically, we have
found two basic types: (i) languages which form complex nouns with a chain of deriva­
tional or inflectional morphemes, and (ii) languages which form complex nouns by con­
catenation of lexical roots. This classification fits the picture of polysynthesis well,
where we observed a type which chains affixes and a type which coalesces lexical roots
(see chapter 7). The existence of complex nouns does not necessarily presuppose a polysynthetic language, as Sanskrit and German show.
Here we will again take up the question posed at the end of chapter 8: How are
such noun complexes to be interpreted in linguistic theory? Is there such a thing as a polysynthetic noun? The complex nouns in all the languages we have presented at least ex­
hibit the principle of head marking in the sense of Nichols (1986).
Looking at the situation from the perspective of the concept of polysynthesis, we
find that while the ideas about polysynthetic verb complexes are fairly congruent, there
is no unanimity as to what nominais should look like in polysynthetic languages.
Mithun, working on Native American languages, points out that nouns are for the most
part not inflected for number, gender, or case, and that there are no obligatory NPs or
number agreement (1988:443, 444). Baker, restricting the domain of polysynthesis to a
phenomenon consisting, roughly, of polypersonalism and incorporation (and thereby ex­
cluding languages such as Greenlandic; 1996:18-20), adds that word order is free and
that there are no true quantifiers or determiners in polysynthetic languages. Nichols
(1986:105) explicitly states that ""there are no polysynthetic nouns"", relegating complex
noun forms in languages like Eskimo, Algonquian, Sioux, and Iroquoian to word forma­
tion. She also considers the ""adjective-noun"" relation to be ""least prone to be headmarked"" (1986:76). As a quintessence, the noun in a polysynthetic language leads a life
in the shadow of the highly complex verb form due to its presumed simplicity. As we
have seen in the last two chapters, however, nouns need not be that simple, as evidenced
e.g. by Greenlandic, Tariana, Chukchi, and Wichita.
The only authors who allow for such complex nouns in polysynthetic languages
are Fortescue and Aikhenvald. Fortescue (1994:2601) includes, in his catalogue for the
identification of polysynthesis, criteria such as the incorporation of an adjectival stem
into a noun and the marking of the possessor on a noun, which correspond to the features
observed in this chapter. This different viewpoint is understandable when taking into
account that Fortescue has Eskimo in mind. Aikhenvald (1999) explicitly describes the
structure of the complex noun form in Tariana as polysynthetic, as we saw above,
without discussing the theoretical implications of this claim.",[281]
"Object-verb synthesis and the integration of adverbial and modal elements such as we
have observed in Nivkh in the last three chapters are found in polysynthetic languages in
the conception fostered by Boas (191 la:74-75). Thus it is worthwhile to examine whe­
ther Nivkh fulfills any further polysynthesis criteria.
Polysynthesis is known from languages of North, Meso-, and Lowland South
America, Australia (Bininj Gun-wok (Gunwinjguan), Tiwi (Non-Pama-Nyungan)),
Siberia (Chukchi and Koryak (Chukcho-Kamchadal), Ket), Munda languages (So:ra,
Gorum) and also from Papua New Guinea (Yimas, Awtuw). Although there is no en­
compassing definition of polysynthesis to date, a set of criteria may be compiled from all
the conditions which have been adduced by different scholars for different types of poly­
synthetic languages (Mithun 1988, Fortescue 1994, Drossard 1997), according to which
a polysynthetic language is basically characterized by:
(i)
'word-sentences' (holophrasis), i.e. complex word forms which translate as
whole sentences into other languages as they comprise the encoding of a predi­
cate's arguments (polypersonalism), adverbial concepts, what would be auxilia­
ries in more analytic languages, and optionally noun incorporation,
(ii)
complex verb forms featuring a high number of morphemes or potential slots
per word, and
(iii)
the prominent role of morphology due to the existence of a fair amount of nonroot bound morphemes with rather concrete ('lexical') meanings, and a signifi­
cant entanglement of derivation and inflection.
Not all of these criteria must be fulfilled for a language to be considered polysynthetic,
but the questions of which parameters are essential or how many of them must be ful­
filled in which combination is usually not discussed in the literature. An exception is
Drossard (1997:253), who postulates as a minimal condition that a language must inte­
grate adverbial material in a bound form within the verb form in order to be counted as
polysynthetic, even without polypersonalism or the integration of nominals (via noun in­
corporation or denominal verbs). This condition seems to be designed too broadly in
view of the fact that languages possessing preverbs,. such as German, Russian, or South
Caucasian, also fulfill it but are otherwise not convincing polysynthetic languages. Com­
pare some examples:NIVKH - A POLYSYNTHETIC LANGUAGE ?","[213, 214]"

tested so far lead us back to the original structural principle in Nivkh, namely dependenthead synthesis. It is from the dependent-head synthesis of lexical morphemes that Nivkh
draws its complexity, and this principle is actually superordinate to aspects of incorpora­
tion and polysynthesis.
7.4
Role of morphology
Morphology plays a more prominent role in polysynthetic languages than syntagmatic
rules on the clause level, as word forms are highly complex and encode syntactic rela­
tions within them. From a syntagmatic perspective, however, these word forms tend to
be controlled by pragmatics rather than by syntax. This is especially true of languages
like Cayuga in which, except for particles and some simplex 'nouns', all word forms are
predicative (cf. Sasse 1993:203-204), and their interrelations in discourse entities which
are translated as sentences into English are clause-like, not constituent-like.
Polysynthetic languages, e.g. in the Americas, are head-marking (in the sense of
Nichols 1986), contain a rich inventory of non-root bound morphemes, such as Greenlandic (Eskimo; see Fortescue 1980), Klamath (see Barker 1964), Slave (Athapaskan;
see Rice 1989), Tarasco (see Foster 1969), Capanawa (Panoan; see Loos 1999 ms.).
These affixes tend to have fairly concrete meanings, represented by lexical morphemes
in more analytic languages (compare e.g. the semantics of the Greenlandic suffixes,
Fortescue 1980:274-278; see (66) of chapter 6.4 and table 9.1 of chapter 9.1). Further­
more, the already weak distinction between derivational and inflectional morphology in
polysynthetic languages is further blurred by the fact that obligatory categories are
marked closer to the root than derivational ones (Fortescue 1994:2601).
Nivkh is a head-marking language, in line with Fortescue's postulation about
polysynthetic languages (1994:2601, point (i)), but not a non-configurational one. The
asymmetry between the free subject constituent and the synthesizing object, together
with the fact that undergoer marking is obligatory and that the non-discontinuous objectverb-complex is permuted, questioned and substituted as a whole (see chapter 3.8), are
good arguments in favor of the existence of a VP and of configurationality. Configurationality contradicts Fortescue's postulation (h) (1994:2601), but as the combination of214DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHhead-marking and configurationality is obviously rare cross-linguistically1 (cf. Van Valin 1985:406 vs. 1987:380), it is conspicuous in itself, not only in relation to polysynthesis.
Interestingly, Nivkh exhibits exactly (see chapters 2, 3.8, 4.1) the ""productive
morphophonemic processes resulting in several allomorphs (phonological shapes) for
both lexical stems and bound morphemes"", Fortescue's criterion (g) for polysynthesis
traits (1994:2601; cf. also Mithun 1988:442). In this, Nivkh resembles, for instance,
Greenlandic.
As opposed to languages such as Greenlandic and Klamath, Nivkh has a compa­
ratively small set of non-root bound morphemes, viz. for aspectoid (seven suffixes), de­
gree (three suffixes), modality (eleven suffixes), scalar and focal (at least seven suffixes
on the verb root), as well as numeral (five suffixes) and locational categories (twelve
morphemes), but these affixes do fulfill the criterion of having a ""fairly concrete
meaning"" (cf. chapters 1.3.4, 6.4). Besides, they outnumber the corresponding category
of suffixes in Chukchi, see chapter 10.2.1.
An entanglement of derivation and inflection in Nivkh is due in part to the suffix
-ḑ. This suffix is basically found in three contexts:
(i)
on predicative verb forms ('indicative');
(ii)
for the nominalization of verbs, both for the productive formation of comple­
ment forms and as lexicalized nouns; and
(iii)
on deictic roots, forming lexicalized demonstratives, and on personal pronouns,
forming possessive pronouns.
The use of the indicative ḑ -form as the most common matrix predicate form is wellknown to us by now. Turning to point (ii), clausal complements are exemplified in (114)
- (122) of chapter 4.3 and in (39) - (40) of chapter 8.4 in the subject and undergoer func­
tions. Here is a peripheral one:

The verbal nominalized form is formed fully productively and is systematically ambi­
guous to the 'indicative' ḑ-form. The ḑ-form of a verb is compatible with all nominal in­
flection if used as an argument or adverbial.In the predicate position of a matrix or com­
plement clause, however, the inflectional potential is restricted to the suffixes listed in
table 1.9 of chapter 1.3.4, while additional non-nominal suffixes are possible on matrix
forms.","[224, 225]"
"168DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHSecondary objects (the patient of ditransitive verbs) are free constituents which are never
marked on the verb.
The undergoer-verb complex may be dissolved under certain syntactic condi­
tions. The lexico-morphological status of a noun, however, does not cause such a disso­
lution: noun roots inflected for number, scalar operator, or relational morpheme (but ne­
ver for case or focus) synthesize to their governing verb, as do proper names, non-singu­
lar personal, demonstrative and interrogative pronouns, and nominalizations.
If two or more undergoers are coordinated, each one bears the associative mar­
ker and the last item synthesizes to its governing verb; all others are phonological words
outside (and preceding) the complex.
If the undergoer is topicalized, dislocated, or focused or if any other constituent
is focused, the undergoer-verb complex is dissolved, i.e. the undergoer appears in the
clause-initial position while a prefix takes its place on the verb. Any focused constituent
other than the undergoer is found in the immediate pre-verbal position. Complex dissolu­
tion also occurs under resultative or reciprocal formation or under the demotion of a par­
ticipant of a ditransitive verb.
Demotion of the primary object does not lead to the promotion of another parti­
cipant, however. Instead, the undergoer prefix is found on the verb. Demotion of or re­
sultative formation to the secondary object does not change relations otherwise.
Thus, the dissolution of a complex is a systematic mechanism occurring under
well-defined syntactic and pragmatic conditions, and not an arbitrary or a sheer surface
phenomenon, as Panfilov believed (1960a, 1966). The question of whether Nivkh nounverb-synthesization constitutes a case of noun incorporation will be tackled in the
following chapter.","[178, 179]"
"According to a by now well-known principle, only the rightmost conjunct of coordinated
modifiers is integrated into a nominal complex. This is true for both coordinated verbal
attributes (without coordination marking) and nominal attributes (in the associative; see
the discussion in chapter 3.8.3).

Conclusion
As the preceding sections have shown, there is a nominal complex in Nivkh which
parallels the verbal complex. The general principle for the noun complex structure, ana­
logous to the verb complex, is that adjacent elements in a dependent-head relation syn­
thesize; thus the Nivkh noun is head-marked as well. The nominal complex may contain
determiners, possessors, different kinds of attributes (nominal, verbal, quantificational),
and relational morphemes. Again, possessors and attributes may be roots, but may also248DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHbe inflected for all categories except case, focus, mood or converb.
Moreover, the synthesizing non-head elements may be proper names, personal,
demonstrative or interrogative pronouns, or interrogative verbs. Excluded from integra­
tion into the complex are adverbial material and non-last coordinated elements.
It is important to note that synthesization in the nominal complex is absolutely
parallel to synthesization in the verbal complex, subject to the same morphophonological
rules. Therefore, if we accept the existence of a verbal complex, with its similarities to
noun incorporation, we have to accept the existence of a nominal complex as well. This
principle is also stressed by Krejnovic (1934, 1937). With determiners, possessors, and
attributes being integrated into a single nominal complex, the whole complex contains
components which form noun phrases in other languages. We may thus say that the com­
plexes resulting from dependent-head synthesis in Nivkh, both verbal and nominal, cor­
respond to phrases in more analytic languages and are 'word-phrases' in that sense.
If the Nivkh verb complex is thought to be polysynthetic, however, and the
Nivkh noun complex parallels it in complexity and in evidence for wordhood, are we
then dealing with polysynthetic nouns in Nivkh? We will concern ourselves with this
question in the next chapter after studying complex noun word forms in a preliminary
cross-linguistic overview.","[258, 259]"
"CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION1.1
The aim of this study
Determining which morphological type a language exhibits does not seem to pose too
many difficulties, especially as the catalogue of types is a fairly fixed and widely agreed
upon entity in linguistics. Nevertheless, languages may, upon closer examination,
challenge the established order in that they manifest a synthetic organization of a quality
not covered by the traditional types of isolating, agglutinating, fusional, root-inflecting,
and polysynthetic languages.
One such language is Nivkh (also known as Gilyak), which stands out from
other languages because of its highly complex word forms of both verbs and nouns.
They are formed from the fully-productive and ad hoc concatenation of lexical roots
which stand in fixed relationships of dependent and head (in the sense of Nichols 1986)
to each other. These complex word forms represent either the most common or even the
only way of encoding the syntactic relations of undergoer / verb and modifier / noun or
verb, in the absence of any morphology specifying the precise kind of the relation within
a complex form.
There are various morphological synthesis phenomena in linguistics - one or
more of which Nivkh could instantiate - viz. noun incorporation, a construction type
concatenating noun and verb, as has been described by Sapir (1911), Mithun (1984,
1994), Baker (1988,1996), Rosen (1989), de Reuse (1994b), and Gerdts (1996) (to name
only the broadest approaches). Furthermore there are verb root serialization (the
concatenation of more than one verb root in one verbal word form; Bisang 1995), and
polysynthesis (Mithun 1988, Fortescue 1994, Baker 1996, Drossard 1997), which both
lead to complex word forms. Noun incorporation and verb root serialization, however,
focus on single domains of morphosyntax, whereas in Nivkh, one single principle domi­
nates the whole of morphosyntax. Polysynthesis is an organizational principle which en­
compasses a larger area of morphosyntax, but which comprises a range of heterogeneous
phenomena such as polypersonalism, noun incorporation, verb root serialization, deriva­
tion, and affixation.
In contrast to this, a single homogeneous structural principle is active in Nivkh.
This principle consists of a systematic and consistent synthesis of heads and their
dependents under adjacency in the order dependent-head, both for modifier and modified
and for governee and governor, and leads to the complex word forms characteristic of
Nivkh.
To my knowledge, such a structural principle of dependent-head synthesis has
not been described for any language heretofore, although any other languages which
could be adequately described by such a principle are of great typological interest. The
principle will be studied here by analyzing Nivkh construction types in detail, and its2DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHaffinity to noun incorporation, verb root serialization and different types of polysynthesis, for which this study furnishes a systematization, will be discussed.
Since not only verb forms but also noun forms manifest a complex structure in
Nivkh, they will be compared to complex noun structures in a range of (mostly polysynthetic) languages. The classification of complex noun structures observed in the context
of different polysynthetic structures opens up a new perspective on the morphological
organization of languages, in particular an overall uniform formation principle domina­
ting several polysynthetic languages which has so far not been acknowledged in the ap­
proaches to polysynthesis. My study concludes with an assessment of the status of the
principle within morphology.
The study is organized as follows: Chapter 1 furnishes an overview of the Nivkh
people and introduces an outline of Nivkh grammar, including the four basic moldings
of dependent-head synthesis, viz. the noun + verb, noun + noun, verb + noun, and verb
+ verb complexes, with which we will deal throughout this study. Chapter 2 gives a de­
tailed account of Nivkh morphophonemics, which dominate the morphosyntax of the
language and are instrumental in the identification of complexes. This prepares the way
for Chapter 3, which addresses the phonotactic, accentual, morphophonemic, morpholo­
gical, and psychological evidence for the wordhood of the different Nivkh complexes.
Chapter 4 is dedicated to the structure and use of the noun + verb complex; Chapter 5
examines its affinities to noun incorporation. Chapter 6 deals with the verb + verb com­
plex in Nivkh as an example of verb root serialization. Chapter 7 discusses the question
of whether Nivkh exhibits polysynthesis on the basis of the findings of Chapters 4
through 6. Chapter 8 is concerned with the structure and use of the nominal complex
(noun + noun and verb + noun complexes) in Nivkh, and Chapter 9 contains a crosslinguistic study of complex noun forms, helping to assess the Nivkh phenomenon. The
final chapter presents a summary of the morphosyntactic structure of Nivkh, an attempt
at a typology of polysynthesis and an interpretation of the dependent-head synthesis in
Nivkh in light of this typology.
1.2
The Nivkh
The term Ñivx, 'Nivkh' in Russian transcription, is the autonym for the Nivkh people
and their language. Both are also known by the xenonym 'Gilyak'.
The Nivkh live in Far East Asia in the territory of the Russian Federation. They
reside in non-compact settlements of mixed ethnic populations in the Lower Amur basin,
along the estuary north and south of the mouth of the Amur river, and on the north, west
and east coasts of the offshore island of Sakhalin with a small settlement in Poronaisk.
Historically, their habitation also extended into some central parts of Sakhalin (Wurm et
al. 1996: Map 115).
According to the 1989 census, 1,079 of 4,631 ethnic Nivkh, i.e. 23,3%, consi­
dered Nivkh to be their native language (Itogi 1990). For the Khabarovsk kray, which
comprises the Amur region, the number of ethnic Nivkh is given as 2,386, of which 544
declared themselves to be speakers of Nivkh (22,8%; Itogi 1990). On Sakhalin, 447 of
2,008 ethnic Nivkh (22,3%) considered Nivkh their mother tongue (de Graaf 1992:196).","[11, 12, 13]"
"The example forms show that -mas- attaches to the -/-stem (or root of vocalic verbs) to
yield a parallel construction to verb root serialization, with the i being an epenthetic
vowel on consonantic verb roots which brings about the open syllable form characte­
ristic of Japanese. Modality, converb suffixes and serialized roots are attached to this -istem. The non-past tense suffix -u following -mas- comes from the verbal paradigm, and
is also triggered by the (non-extant) source verb. The negational suffix, on the other
hand, follows the -a-stem, to which suffixes for the causative, passive, and irrealis are
attached (which gives rise to my term 'non-control stem'). It triggers the adjectival nonpast suffix, as does its (still extant) source. If negation and honorative are to be com­
bined, however, -mas- triggers the special negational suffix -en, which does not occur in
any other context. Thus, there is evidence for a grammaticalization out of a verb root se­
rial construction in Japanese.
In Japanese, we also encounter full verbs in the second verb root position in se­
rialization which both recur in lexicalized formations and have been grammaticalized,
parallel to Nivkh -jiki-, e.g. kakeru ""attach"" and dasu ""take out"". In the example below,
they are combined with hanasu ""speak"" and warau ""laugh"".

the polysynthetic verb form in the form of optional suffixes. The morphemes number in
the hundreds and have quite concrete meanings, but a lexical source cannot be recon­
structed for them (see Fortescue 1992a:245). Here are some suffixes, including the se­
mantic domains Nivkh expresses with verb root serialization and modals:THE VERB + VERB COMPLEX(66)Greenlandic

-lluar""well, a lot""
""be easy to""
-jurtur""one after another""
""be good at""
-galuar- (contrary to expectance)In light of these phenomena, we imagine that Nivkh modals started out as second roots
in a serial root construction, lost connection to their sources to different degrees (we do
not know how old the different modals are) and underwent further changes until some
reached a state comparable to the Greenlandic non-root bound morphemes. The greatest
formal change has occurred in -yzu-, the negative experiential and negative habitual. It
has lost phonological substance and become bound in comparison to its source verb
j-әyzu-a1 ""s.o. ignores sth."", and it has developed its own allomorphy -yzu- ~ -ksu- ~ -xsu(in line with the usual consonant alternation and parallel to the completive -yet-, for
example).
In terms of semantics, there is a change from jdyzua1 ""ignore"" via ""not know how
to V"" (with a verbal complement) to Negative Experiential (""never have V-ed"") and fi­
nally to Negative Habitual. In East Sakhalin, it is even close to a simple negation marker.
Compare the following examples illustrating the different meanings:

"170DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHLanguages with what are traditionally called 'lexical affixes' attach non-root bound mor­
phemes to the verb conveying meanings translated as nouns or adverbials in European
languages, but having no synchronic relation to nouns in the language in question. Salish
and Wakashan languages are two examples.

bound morphemes without any relation to free-standing verbs (cf. Gerdts 1996:97). Such
denominal verbs are found in Greenlandic (Eskimo; Sadock 1985, Fortescue 1984),
Kwakwala (Wakashan; Boas 1911c), Abkhaz (North-West Caucasian; Hewitt 1989), Ja­

1986:273) and Chukchi (Chukcho-Kamchadal; Kämpfe/Volodin 1995). They are present
in Nivkh, as well (see chapter 1.3.6), formed e.g. with the verbalizers -varkf ""sth. con­
tains sth. exclusively"", -varaḑ ""sth. is similar to N"", -valaḑ ""sth. is N-colored"", -ʁfavrg
""sth. is N-less"", and -etţ ""N begins"", which are not or no longer free verbs.
In distinction to noun incorporation, the three other phenomena either do not
have morphological N+V units or do not combine both a lexical noun and verb form.
A fifth phenomenon which is not clearly delimited from noun stripping in
Gerdts (1996:99), Mardirussian (1975), and Mithun (1984), is differential object mar­
king (cf. Lazard 1984), as in Turkish, Finnish, etc. In these languages, the direct object
is marked in two different ways depending on its animacy, definiteness or referential
status, or on the verb class, tense or aspect of the governing verb. This is the case in Tur­
kish with accusative or without case marking (Dede 1986) and in Finnish with accusa­
tive or partitive case (Chesterman 1991). The non-case-marked (and non-coalescing
though adjacent) direct object in Turkish differs from noun stripping, as it occurs in'NOUN INCORPORATION IN NIVKH ?","[180, 181, 182]"
"Non-root bound morphemes with 'quite lexical meaning' are understood to be affixes
with meanings which would be expressed by independent forms, especially lexical roots,
in more analytic languages. Polypersonalism, in conjunction with the discussion in chap­
ter 7.1 and in line with Boas (1911a) and Drossard (1997), is not considered a necessary
condition here. A language with TAM, polarity markers, polypersonalism and valencerelated morphology on the verb is not considered polysynthetic if no other categories
from the catalogue can be marked on the verb.
When examining languages which fulfill these criteria we observe that quite dif­
ferent sets of criteria apply out of the pool of ingredients and that the categories in (3),
such as central participants, instrument, quantification, location/direction/motion, moda­
lity, manner, chronology, and phase, may be encoded in basically two different forms:
either as lexical morphemes, which are understood to be roots, i.e. forming word forms
on their own outside of a larger complex, or as non-root bound morphemes. Participants
(except person marking), classifiers, instruments, and location encoded by non-root
bound morphemes on a lexical verb root are usually termed 'lexical affixes' or 'fieldaffixes'.
Lexical morphemes, depending on the number of lexical categories that are di­
stinguished in a language, may be nominal, verbal, adjectival stems, adverbs or even adpositions. In most of the languages in question, however, only noun and verb roots seem
to be involved. The morphological and phonological integration of a (lexical) noun root
into a verb complex then is known as noun incorporation (cf. Gerdts 1996). The morpho­
logical and phonological integration of an additional verb root into a verb complex cor­
responds to verb root serialization (see Bisang 1995).
At this point, it is important that an essential distinction be drawn. Noun incor­
poration and verb root serialization are phenomena which are independent of one
another and of poly synthesis. Languages that have either
(i)
noun incorporation alone (e.g. Danish, Dutch and Frisian (Weggelaar 1986)) or
(ii)
verb root serialization alone (e.g. Yamphu (Kiranti; Rutgers 1998), Yuchi
(North America; Mithun 1999:571-573))
without further polysynthetic traits included in the above-mentioned catalogue (e.g. locational affixes) are not considered polysynthetic. Noun incorporation and verb root seria­
lization contribute to the polysynthetic character of a language, however, and it seems
that most noun incorporating languages are indeed polysynthetic, since non-polysynthetic noun incorporating languages are not so easy to find.
The third possibility, languages with both noun incorporation and verb root se­
rialization, is more difficult to decide on, as both mechanisms together lead to fairly278DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHcomplex verb forms, even leaving the additional criteria aside. Yucatec Maya, for in­
stance, manifests noun incorporation, polypersonalism and suffixes for aspect and va­
lence-changing categories, but quantificational, chronological or manner material seems
to-be integrated into the verb via verb root serialization only (or possibly via adjective
incorporation), not in the form of affixes (cf. Blair 1964:65, Bricker/Po?ot Yah/Dzul de
Po?ot 1998). According to the criteria in (3), Yucatec is a borderline case. It lacks nonroot bound morphemes with fairly 'lexical' meaning, but verb root serialization may be
considered a sort of compensation for that, as categories out of the catalogue (quantifica­
tion, manner, chronology) are expressed this way.
Swedish is a similar case, with noun and adjective incorporation as well as verb
root serialization. Adjectives integrated into the verb form also express degree and chro­
nology.

Inflection of possessor and attributive nouns
In a noun+noun complex, the first noun may not only be in its root form, it may also be
inflected for number and/or scalar operators, but never for case or focus, just like the
noun in the noun+verb complex (see chapter 4.3). Nevertheless, inflection in the noun +
noun complex very rarely occurs. Correlative-associative number is marked on two co­
ordinated possessors or nominal attributes. The last item of a series of conjuncts synthe­
sizes to its head with the associative suffix (a peculiarity we anticipated in chapter 3.8.3).",[239]

275276DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHNivkh fulfills a considerable number of polysynthesis criteria, viz. the integration of ma­
terial expressing one undergoer, causative, aspectoids, tense, degree, modality, mood,
scalar operators, focus values, manner, quantification, and location into a complex verb
form. These categories are partly encoded by non-root bound morphemes, of which there
is only a moderate number, and partly by dependent-head synthesis. Nivkh exhibits a
templatic organization of the suffixal domain of the verb complex and a root-chaining
organization to the left of the head morpheme.
With its highly synthetic word complexes and its head-marked pattern, the
Nivkh structure is reminiscent of polysynthesis. Still, we have not yet reached a conclu­
sion as to whether or not Nivkh really fits into the picture of polysynthetic languages.
10.2
Basic structural types of polysynthesis - an attempt at a classification
As there is no accepted definition of polysynthesis, and polysynthesis in the traditional
sense is a 'feeling' rather than a clear-cut class, we have to compare Nivkh to the lan­
guages which make a polysynthetic impression in a heuristic approach according to the
parameters listed in chapter 7. In the same chapter, we already alluded to the heteroge­
neity of such languages. It has led Fortescue to set up a first classification of different
types of polysynthesis as follows (1994:2602)1:
(a) pure incorporating (Chukchi, Onondaga)
(b) recursive affixing (West Greenlandic, Yupik)
(c) field-affixing (Atsugewa, Kalispel)
(d) mixed 1+3 (Koyukon)
(e) mixed 2+3 (Kwakwala)
(f) mixed 1+2 (Nahuatl).
Based on an examination of approximately 75 languages, we will rearrange and
modify this classification somewhat, restricting us to verbal polysynthesis for the
moment.2
First, based on the catalogue of polysynthesis traits (by Mithun 1988, Fortescue 1994,
and Drossard 1997; see chapter 7), I use the following set of formal and semantic criteria
for polysynthesis:
(3)
(i)1A language is acknowledged to be polysynthetic because of
the existence of complex, polymorphemic verb forms which allow, within one
word unit, for components in the form of non-root bound morphemes with quite
'lexical' meaning or optionally for the concatenation of lexical roots;The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are obviously meant to refer to the small letters (a), (b), and (c) by
Fortescue.
2
In order to assess these languages, I had to rely on grammars that varied in their extent of detail.
It may well be that the classification reached in this study will need future correction because
relevant information on the classificatory parameters used here was misinterpreted or is not expli­
citly or unambiguously mentioned in the grammars consulted. When there was any doubt, the
language in question was left out of the classification.","[285, 286, 287]"

head of a phrase and followed by a constituent of the same phrase, e.g. the noun head of
a NP followed by a modifier or determiner, the verbal head of a VP followed by a com­
plement, or the preposition of a PP (Odden 1987).

seems to be that they are defined with respect to a word boundary (Hooper 1976:17,
Clayton 1981, see e.g. the contributions in Andersen 1986). This introduces the first re­
levant parameter, viz. the domain in which sandhi applies. Sandhi phenomena have been
described in domains ranging from the word via the phrase to the sentence and even
across sentence boundaries (such as the English linking-r, Vogel 1986).
If we restrict sandhi to a morphophonemic process applying across a word boun­
dary, as Ternes (1986:14-16) proposes, the identification of word boundaries must pre­
cede the recognition of sandhi. For Nivkh this would mean that we would have to prove
independently where the word boundaries are. The question still remains though: which
boundaries count, the phonological word boundaries or the morphological ones?
The original phenomenon for which the term 'sandhi' was coined in Sanskrit is
observed both within words as well as across word boundaries, known as internal and
external sandhi (cf. Ternes 1986:11). The actual processes consist of different pheno­
mena such as voicing or vowel hiatus elimination, but are largely identical for internal
and external sandhi (Bucknell 1994:5). Furthermore, the fact that identical sandhi pro­
cesses occur both within a word and across a word boundary is not unique to Sanskrit:
this also occurs with, for instance, the English linking-r (Vogel 1986) and Italian Gorgia
Toscana (Nespor/Vogel 1982:238). Phenomena such as these seem to have inspired
Basbøll's claim that the ""boundaries surrounding a non-phonologically defined word
have no special status with respect to sandhi"" (1986:24).
With this in mind, the status of Nivkh complexes remains hard to determine,
since the consonant alternations in Nivkh apply, as we saw in sections 3.3 and 3.3.1, at
inflectional boundaries, i.e. word-internally, as well. Nivkh cannot be said to lack a
phonetic word boundary, as Ternes (1986:20) proposes for Spanish with respect to its
voicing of any intervocalic stops. The final devoicing of fricatives and the restriction to
initial clusters of at most two consonants establishes such a phonetic word boundary in
Nivkh. The boundaries between the elements of complexes could thus be word-internal,
paralleling inflection, or could be found between words. In the latter case, consonant
alternations would be sandhi occurring both word-internally and across word bounda­
ries, but only across 'words' without finite or case inflection and in a syntactically welldefined relation to one another. These relations roughly define domains which are
phrases in European languages. Otherwise there are not any morphophonemic processes96DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHin Nivkh occurring in domains larger than the complex, e.g. after discourse markers,
case-marked nouns, mood-marked verbs, converbs, between subject and predicate, or
between adverbials and anything preceding or following them. This is worth noting if it
is taken into account that sandhi phenomena which have been described as applying
within phrases, e.g. Italian raddoppiamento sintattico, also occur across phrases (see
Nespor/Vogel 1986:38-40,165-174). Suspending a conclusion for the moment, we turn
to further parameters describing sandhi phenomena.
A second parameter concerns the obligatoriness of morphophonemic processes.
Both obligatory processes, such as Sanskrit sandhi, as well as register-dependent (e.g.
English linking-r, Vogel 1986:60pp) or speech rate-dependent ones are subsumed under
the term sandhi. One sandhi phenomenon can even be both obligatory and optional
under different conditions, e.g. French liaison (see below) or Danish nasal alternation,
which is obligatory on the syllabic and morphemic levels, but register-dependent on the
utterance level (Basbøll 1986:23). In Nivkh, all morphophonemic processes are obligato­
ry, and not dependent on the speaker or the occasion.
Further, sandhi may be conditioned phonologically only, as in Sanskrit, where
it applies in any syntactic constellation with only a handful of minor exceptions (see
Bucknell 1994:4); morphologically or syntactically only (e.g. Kimatuumbi vowel shorte­
ning of the phrasal head, Odden 1987; Welsh mutations, Ball/Müller 1992); or both pho­
nologically and morphologically/syntactically, e.g. Italian raddoppiamento sintattico
(Nespor/Vogel 1982). Nivkh consonant alternation is conditioned by both the phonologi­
cal (final and initial sound constellations) and the syntactic context (undergoer-verb, at­
tribute-noun, possessor-noun).
Finally, whereas most sandhi processes occur under adjacency of the target and
trigger, Welsh mutations, which are termed sandhi, occur under both adjacency and nonadjacency (syntactic triggers). With respect to this criterion, Nivkh consonant alterna­
tions occur strictly under adjacency.
Besides these defining parameters, the actual morphophonemic processes recog­
nized as sandhi are quite heterogeneous. Among them are assimilation (Sanskrit), vowel
harmony (e.g. in Hungarian), elision (French), epenthesis (French liaison, English lin­
king-r), resyllabification (French enchaînement), lenition (Gorgia Toscana, Welsh muta­
tions), fortition of segments (Welsh word-internal mutations) and also of suprasegmentals, e.g. tone sandhi in Chinese (Chen 1987).
These varied features make sandhi a very vague concept, or rather a melting pot.
In view of the variety of the phenomena, a more concise classification is missed if all of
them are subsumed under the one term sandhi which conceals their status and functiona­
lity. While Kimatuumbi vowel shortening seems to be a strict phrase marker, Welsh mu­
tations are not consistently so, and Italian raddoppiamento sintattico is consistent within
phrases, but also applies between constituents of different phrases (Nespor/Vogel 1986:
228). English linking-r and Sanskrit sandhi, on the other hand, obviously do not define
syntactic units.
A case in point is the French liaison, which at first seems to bear a resemblance
to Nivkh in that it leads to a coalescence of independent words in a phrase. However, aDEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD97distinction is to be made in French between environments in which liaison (and analo­
gously, enchaînement) is obligatory, optional or impossible; furthermore, liaison (conso­
nant epenthesis), enchaînement (resyllabification), and vowel elision complement one
another in a common functionality, a fact which is not of interest to a number of studies
concerning French (see for example De Jong 1990, Klausenburger 1974:175, Kaisse
1985:162-168).
Liaison, enchaînement, and elision are obligatory in two environments (ignoring
frozen expressions): (i) between the determiner (articles; several indefinite determiners;
possessive, demonstrative, and interrogative adjectives; quantifiers; and numerals (De
Jong 1990:79)) and the following element (modifier or head), and (ii) with pronominal
markers directly preceding or following the verb as well as with the negation marker on
the verb (cf. Malécot 1975:163-166). In both cases, all three mechanisms operate on dif­
ferent forms constituting one paradigm, as exemplified below.

"194DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHSome verbs, such as urḑ ""sth. is good"", are found in both ad hoc and lexicalized forma­
tions.
6.4
The modal verb construction
Modalities are expressed in Nivkh either in auxiliary or complement constructions, with
suffixes, or in a construction which originated in verb root serialization. The latter form
is typical for deontic modality, and more specifically for negative modality and negation
itself in the Amur variety (whereas complement-taking modal verbs are both affirmative
and negative). It is fully productive and formed ad hoc, and the first verb root is not
subject to any restrictions. The modal verbs take the position of the second root. The
modals are (cf. Krejnovic 1934:217-218,1979:317; Panfilov 1965:105,156-163; Otaina

"If a complex is dissolved, a change in stress pattern accompanies the change in form (see
chapter 4.4). In the example below, the (a) version displays a N+V complex with its
typical noun stress; in the (b) version, the undergoer is encoded as a topic outside the
verb, and a coindexed undergoer marker is found on the verb. Topic and predicate are
stressed separately.

word forms in Nivkh and is a valid criterion for morphological wordhood.
Jakobson, like Krejnovič, considers the complexes (his 'syntactic sections') to
be stress and pause units (1971:78).
Furthermore, in 1962, at the time when the question of incorporation in Nivkh
was being hotly debated by Krejnovič and Panfilov, Bondarko & Zinder examined com­
plex structures in Nivkh in phonetic experiments. They submitted 30 test sentences to
five native speakers each and evaluated the waveforms of the recordings. The test sen­
tences represent the following types of syntactic constructions:

(37)[attributive noun-noun complex], e.g.

""fox('s) track""Their results, illustrated in part by waveforms, are as follows: In type (i) subject-predi­
cate constructions, ""both words have the same intensity"" (1962:85) [actually referring to
the amplitude instead of the intensity], i.e. the waveforms show two stretches of acoustic
signal, one for /aŋ/ ""who"" and one for /χaʤ/ ""s.o. shoots it"", with the amplitudes of the
two (identical) vowels being equal. In type (ii), with the assumed undergoer-verb com­
plex, there are three sections of which the first two, /if/ ""s/he"" and /aŋ/ ""who"", show
equal vowel amplitudes, while for the section /qhaʤ/ ""shoot"" the amplitude is clearly
lower. This pattern constitutes a regularity observed in all speakers, differing only in de­
gree (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85). The problematic point about this interpretation is that,
because the low-amplitudinal section is at the sentence boundary, it may represent a
sentence-final creaky voice phase.
Bondarko & Zinder see their findings confirmed by an evaluation of the duration
of the vowels. In type (ii) constructions, the duration of the vowel of the verb forming a
complex with its undergoer is shorter than in the corresponding type (i) constructions
with the bare verb. For three speakers, the vowel of the 'non-incorporating' verb in type
(i) constructions was 1.5 to two times longer; the minimal difference of duration,
observed with a fourth informant, was 20 ms. This vowel reduction is not dependent on
the phonetic context of the utterance (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85). Amplitudinal and du­
rational differences, if accepted as significant, support Krejnovič's stress rule that in
noun + verb complexes, stress falls on the noun (see above).
For constructions of both type (iv) (lexicalized noun compounds) and (v) (nonlexicalized complexes), Bondarko & Zinder note a low amplitude for vowels in the
second element of both types in comparison to the same element as a simplex form, but
the overall difference is less clear-cut. The duration analysis, too, shows less consistent
and more ambiguous results (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85-89).
In comparing type (ii) and type (iii) constructions, Bondarko & Zinder point out
that in ñivx ləyi-ŋəŋḍ ""man hunts salmon"", there are two amplitudinal maxima, one on
the /i/ of ñivx and one on the /a/ of ləyi (as is typical for construction type (ii)), whereasDEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD89in ləyi-ŋəŋ-ñivx ""man who hunts salmon"", there is only one, namely on the first /ə/
(1962:89).
Bondarko & Zinder conclude from these results that independent word forms are
distinguishable from elements in word complexes. They also find that in word-comple­
xes, such as aŋ-q'aḍ ""s.o. shoots whom?"", two (or more) elements are ""fused into one
whole"", constituting a phonetic unit (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85). This experimental re­
search supports Krejnovič's analysis of the Nivkh complexes as 'wholes'. It has not re­
ceived, however, much attention among Nivkhologists.
Elaborating on this experimental basis, we will now proceed to an analysis of
Nivkh speech material. The speaker is a middle-aged Nivkh teacher of Nekrasovska
(North Sakhalin), whose linguistic background comprises North Sakhalin and Amur
Nivkh. She read out a sample of 55 different sentences (taken from the extant language
materials), which were written on cards, to the non-native speaker interviewer, repeating
each item about ten times in random order. On the cards, the modern conventional ortho­
graphy was used which follows Panfilov's tradition of writing as separate words as much
as possible. The speaker's articulation was clear and rather slow. The recordings were
analyzed digitally with regards to different parameters. For this presentation, a number
of the more complex sentences which illustrate different structural types of complexes
have been chosen, as well as inflected word forms and compounds.

So far, Japanese does not look very polysynthetic. Relevant categories from the cata­
logue in (3), however, may be expressed within a complex verb form via verb root seria­
lization (as in Yucatec Maya), viz. phases of states of affairs, manner, direction, chrono­
logy, degree, and valence-changing (cf. the list by Martin 1988:441-455). Compare the
following examples:

Even if no more than two verb roots occur in series (larger constructions are
disliked by native speakers), the effect of verb root serialization is comparable to that of
affixes in polysynthetic languages (remember that apersonalism does not prevent a lan­
guage from being polysynthetic).
Is there then anything delimiting Japanese from polysynthetic languages? Note
that the overall complexity of the verb form (measured by morpheme count, something
often cited as a means to identify polysynthesis, see Fortescue 1994:2601) is not a valid
distinctive feature. Most examples of verb forms cited in grammars of and papers on po­
lysynthetic languages are not very complex and contain only two to four morphemes
(see examples e.g. in Fortescue 1984, Mithun 1999). What Japanese, Swedish, and Yu­
catec Maya clearly lack, in contrast to those languages which are considered polysynthe­
tic without a doubt, are adverbial elements in the form of non-root bound morphemes in
the verb form, such as locational, instrumental, or manner ones.
If we want to exclude Japanese, Swedish, and Yucatec Maya from polysynthetic
languages, then the existence of at least one non-root bound morpheme with a fairly 'le­
xical' meaning in the locational, instrumental or manner domain (the latter two are
sometimes difficult to keep apart) must be made a necessary condition for polysynthesis,
in line with what Drossard (1997) postulates. The problem with this criterion, besides its
still being vague, is that the ideas about 'lexical' (or 'concrete' as it is sometimes called)
meaning and ontological domains are conceived from a Eurocentric or Anglocentric
viewpoint.
Nevertheless, we do not seem to gain anything by trying to concretize the crite­
rion, e.g. by fixing which kind of non-root bound morpheme constitutes a minimal con-280DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHdition for the recognition of polysynthesis.
The comparison of the 62 languages of our sample which look sufficiently polysynthetic in the heuristic approach shows that 56 of these have at least one local or direc­
tional affix, with Chinook (Boas 191Id), Sarcee (Athapaskan; Cook 1984), Tonkawa
(Hoijer 1933), Wintu (Wintuan; Pitkin 1984), and So:ra (Munda; Pinnow 1966) having
locationals to the exclusion of instrumental and manner elements (where the adverbial
domain is concerned). Chukchi (Chukcho-Kamchadal; Kämpfe/Volodin 1995), So:ra
and Arabana-Wangkangurru (Pama-Nyungan; Hercus 1994) each have a single local/di­
rectional morpheme, and Classical Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan; Andrews 1975) and Iroquoian
languages have two (called 'cislocative' and 'translocative' in Iroquoian).
Instrumentals, on the other hand, occur considerably less often (in 24 lan­
guages). Languages with instrumentais have locationals as well, with the exception of
Washo (see Kroeber 1907), which has instrumentais only (where the adverbial domain
is concerned). Manner elements occur in 25 languages, four of which do not have loca­
tionals and only seven of which have instrumentais as well. Other affixes are even less
common. Chronology affixes, for instance, occur in 19 languages (all with locationals,
but only three which also have instrumentais), and degree affixes are found in 17 lan­
guages, four of which lack locationals and instrumentais. Kwakwala (Wakashan; Boas
1911c), Yana (Mithun 1999:565), and Paumari (Arawan; Chapman/Derbyshire 1991)
have four of the five categories examined and no instrumentais. Thus, the findings do
not allow any implicational hierarchy to be set up.
The overwhelming results for locationals suggest that the existence of such ma­
terial should be made a necessary condition for polysynthesis. By this criterion, how­
ever, not only Yucatec Maya, but also Washo, Kiowa (Kiowa-Tanoan; see Watkins
1984), Cahuilla (Uto-Aztecan; see Seiler 1977), Yuki (see Kroeber 1911), Pirahä (MuraPirahã; see Everett 1986), Urubu-Kaapor (Tupí-Guaraní; see Kakumasu 1986), Ainu (see
Tamura 2000), and, last but not least, Nivkh, would be excluded from polysynthetic lan­
guages, even though they all have non-root bound morphemes encoding more than one
of the categories of manner, degree, modality, valence-changing, instrument, motion,
phase and chronology, and fit into the heuristic idea of poly synthesis. Washo, Kiowa,
Cahuilla, and Yuki, however, have motional affixes which might substitute for locatio­
nals to fulfill the condition. Compare examples from Kiowa and Pirahä to Chukchi and
Greenlandic below.

forth"", -jaar- ""early"", and -jaallu- ""early (habitually)"", which do not qualify as local but
rather as frequency and manner, according to Fortescue (1990). Greenlandic undoubted­
ly lacks instrumentais.
In any case, the existence of a locational bound morpheme on the verb could not
be a sufficient condition for polysynthesis, as it is true of languages with local preverbs
such as South Caucasian, German, Russian, and Hungarian (see chapter 7). Therefore, it
needs to be tied to further criteria from the catalogue in (3).
If we postulated the existence of at least one non-root bound morpheme in the
domains of location, instrument or manner, Nivkh, Pirahã, and Urubu-Kaapor would still
be excluded. Because of the shortcomings of the discussed postulations, the best solution
is to leave this point open until the candidate languages for polysynthesis have been
compared on the basis of the details of their ingredients. Alternatively, we can broaden
the perspective, which will be done in section 10.3 of this chapter. The discussion has
shown, however, how decisive the fixation of delimiting criteria is in our assessment of
Nivkh, putting Nivkh in a borderline area of polysynthesis.
For the classification of polysynthesis we will depart from languages which are
not marginal with regards to the catalogue of criteria in (3).
It is easily observed that languages assign categories from the polysynthesis
catalogue to either lexical roots (via noun incorporation or verb root serialization) or to
non-root bound morphemes (including lexical affixes). Participants may be encoded via
person marking, noun incorporation or lexical affixes, while motion and phases of states
of affairs can be via verb roots or affixes; instrument, quantification, manner, or direc­
tion may be expressed by a nominal or verbal root, or by an affix. Furthermore, polysynthetic languages differ with respect to how many lexical roots they allow in a complex
verb form. These constitute the two basic parameters of one axis of our classification:
(i)
the assignment of categories of the polysynthesis catalogue to lexical roots or
non-root bound morphemes, and
(ii)
the number of lexical roots allowed in a complex word form.
This axis describes the word-formational type exhibited by a polysynthetic language.
10.2.1 Affixal and compositional polysynthesis
The application of these parameters to the languages in question results in different formational types with two extremes, either
(i)
languages which use non-root bound morphemes for all of the above-mentioned
categories in catalogue (3) and allow only one root per verb complex, which we
will henceforth call the affixal strategy, or
(ii)
languages which ad hoc combine more than one lexical root in a verb form to
attain a polysynthetic verb form, called the compositional strategy.
'Affixal' and 'compositional' have been chosen here as handy terms for the phenomena,
based on the terminology for the mechanisms of word formation. The former strategy is
not generally inflectional since most affixes are not obligatory, nor do they represent in-282DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKHflectional categories. They are fully productive and marked on the verb ad hoc, so their
status is actually somewhere in the grey area between derivation and inflection. Affixal
and compositional poly synthesis are not complementary types: affixes (non-root bound
morphemes) are a necessary condition for the recognition of poly synthesis.
Before proceeding to a finer-grained classification, let us consider an example of
both types: Greenlandic, an affixally polysynthetic language, and Chukchi, a compositionally polysynthetic one.
Greenlandic (Eskimo-Aleut; Fortescue 1984) allows only one root morpheme
per word form (in the initial position) while all other categories are expressed using nonroot bound morphemes or the final inflectional suffix (for mood and person). Fortescue
(1990:321-332) lists 262 suffixes that are non-root bound morphemes and which express
categories from the catalogue (excluding category-changing, nominal affixes and inflec­
tion; see also (66) in chapter 6.4 and table 9.1 in chapter 9.1). Noun incorporation and
verb root serialization are absent in Greenlandic. There are, however, denominal verbs
(formed from lexical noun roots with verbalizing suffixes).

"THE NOUN + VERB COMPLEX13 3Panfilov, as an orthographic 'splitter', always writes prefixes and the following noun or
verb as a single word, but writes non-singular pronouns and the noun denoting the possessee or the verb by which they are governed as separate words.
Because of these different pieces of evidence, it seems safe to assign two
different statuses to the singular and non-singular possessor and undergoer markers:
tighter bound prefixes to the former and pronouns to the latter, the only allomorph of
which may be used as a free constituent or in a noun or verb complex, in the same way
as a noun.
4.2
Valency
A prefix, pronoun or noun attached to a transitive verb not only fills an obligatory slot,
it also saturates one place of the verb's valency. Several valency classes are observed in
Nivkh. It has to be taken into account, however, that, in contrast to the undergoer reflex
on the verb, central participants outside the verb complex need not be encoded overtly,
i.e. in the form of nouns or pronouns (cf. Krejnovic 1958:27). If they are, only the
causee is case-marked. There are, in addition, overt verb-external participants licensed
by the verb's valency, which bear peripheral cases (Otaina 1978:32-34, Krejnovic 1934:
198, Panfilov 1960b). This leads to a systematization of valency types as in table 4.2,
which is based on the valency types established by Otaina (1978:32-34; see also
Panfilov 1965:46-47).

TABLE 4.2: Valency typesWe will study these types and labile verbs in turn.
4.2.1 Non-transitive verbs
Non-transitive verbs are characterized by the absence of an undergoer slot. Avalent
verbs, such as weather expressions, e.g. lajuɖ} ""it is stormy"", do not license a participant.
There are labile verbs which allow two constructional alternatives, an avalent and an
intransitive use (i.e. with a subject), e.g.tivaɖ""it is cold"", qavɖ ""it is hot"",vukvukuaɖ""it
darkens"", Ŋɖ ""it is dark"",k'unuaɖ""it is bright, clear"",letBd""it is slippery"", rjalsqo ""it is
dirty"", hoñtíaa1 ""it is empty"", kuyә ""it is spacious"" (cf. Otaina 1978:32). The two uses
are contrasted below, with the avalent use shown in the (a) version.","[143, 144]"
"DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD99tion only occurs at morpheme boundaries within a word, not across word boundaries.
As we saw above, however, these alternations are not phonologically conditioned and
even occur under the non-adjacency of trigger and target word, which are both separate­
ly inflected. Thus the question of wordhood does not come up as it does in Nivkh.
Consonant alternation is also common in the West-African Mande and Bantu
languages. In the Bantu language Fula, only initial plosives alternate with homorganic
continuants and nasals, but the alternations are not synchronically motivated phonologi­
cally. The initial sound of nouns changes depending on the suffix on that noun; for suffi­
xes, it changes depending on the stem they are attached to (cf. Skousen 1972). The alter­
nating initial sound of verbs now functions as a number agreement marker (cf.
Gottschligg 1995). The situation is obviously not comparable to Nivkh.
In Mande languages, initial consonant change taking place under the adjacency
of trigger and target is obligatory, and both phonologically and syntactically condi­
tioned. Hence a comparison to Nivkh seems worthwhile.
Let us consider two examples, Kpelle and Mende, which represent two subclas­
ses of alternation languages within Mande. In Kpelle (and Manya, Manessy 1964:165168), a final nasal triggers alternation of a following initial non-nasal; in Mende, Loma
and Bandi, alternation takes place after a preceding final vowel, i.e. in the intervocalic
position.
In Kpelle, the alternating consonants are non-nasal plosives and fricatives as in
Nivkh, but also glides and laterals (Bird 1971). Nasals and voiced obstruents (except for
Ibl and lyl) do not alternate. The initial voiceless plosives and fricatives of nouns, nume­
rals and verbs are voiced, and initial /b/, /y/ and sonorants change into a homorganic
nasal if they follow a syllable consisting of a syllabic nasal with a low tone.

high tone nasal which assimilates to the alternating consonant in place.

Conteh, Cowper & Rice (1986) give an overview of initial consonant change in
Mende. There, the changes target the initial consonants of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and
postpositions, and the changes are syntactically conditioned. The phonological trigger
seems to be the final vowel of the preceding element (Cowper/Rice 1987:193). The alter­
nations are:

consists of simple intervocalic lenition and assimilation of segments. Lenition takes
place in the following environments, where it affects the initial consonant of the consti­
tuent in boldface (cf. Conteh/Cowper/Rice 1986:108-109, Cowper/Rice 1987:189-190):

""that's the chief'These mutation conditions resemble the Nivkh situation. In Nivkh, alternations occur in
possessor + noun constructions, modifying noun + noun constructions, attribute + noun
constructions, noun + relational morpheme constructions, and undergoer + verb con­
structions as well. In Mende, lenition occurs within phrases, with the exception of
subject + intransitive verb contexts. In such a context in Nivkh, there is never consonant
alternation. Another basic difference between Mende and Nivkh is that, although the
element following a trigger undergoes alternation in both languages, this element is
always the head in Nivkh. In Mende, the attributive adjective and determiner follow the
head noun, and the adjective shows initial mutation. A further difference is the fact that
in Mende proper names, relational nouns and numerals are excluded from mutation (cf.
Conteh/Cowper/Rice 1986:116, Manessy 1964:176).
The two languages are again parallel in contexts where mutation does not apply.
If the undergoer is not represented by phonological material or if it is left-dislocated into
the focus position, there is no verb mutation. This is also true of Nivkh (see chapter
4.4.1). Particles do not trigger mutations, either (cf. Conteh/Cowper/Rice 1986:116).

(cf. Conteh/Cowper/Rice 1986:110). Nivkh is predicate-final (SXOV), however, while
in Mende the peripheral material follows the verb (SOVX). In light of this far-reaching
parallelism both in phonological as well as in syntactic matters of consonant alternation
in Nivkh and Mende, it would be interesting to know more about wordhood in Mende.
Unfortunately, neither Conteh, Cowper & Rice (1986), Manessy (1964), nor Bird (1971)
discuss this topic. Cowper & Rice (1987:188) view mutation as external sandhi.
Manessy (1964) indicates that for the application of alternation syntactic con­
texts are generalized, overriding phonology, the role of which is weak because the origi­
nal (nasal) trigger has been lost. This is reminiscent of what Gottschligg claims about
Fula, viz. that the originally phonologically conditioned phenomenon was grammaticalized (1995:14-26). In Nivkh, however, phonological conditioning is stable. One reason
for this stability could be that the phonological processes are protected within a morpho­
logical unit, i.e. that they are word-internal.","[109, 110, 111, 112]"

University of Cologne, Germany in Summer 2001.
While writing it, I have profited from the support of many people. First of all, I would
like to express my gratitude to Hidetoshi Shiraishi and Svetlana Filimonovna Polet'eva.
Hidetoshi Shiraishi so very kindly conducted field work for me, too, during his own
research trip. From the materials I sent him, he wrote filing cards, did the interviews with
the consultant and recorded and documented the spoken language. Svetlana Polet'eva
kindly read out the materials on the cards. I am very much obliged to both of them for
the pains they took and time they sacrificed on my behalf.
I am very grateful to Hans-Jürgen Sasse and Elisabeth Löbel, my supervisors, for their
valuable comments, and to the other members of my doctoral committee, Franziska
Ehmcke, Ursula Stephany, Fritz Serzisko, and Frank Heidermanns. Hans-Jürgen Sasse
let me work on Nivkh freely within the parameters of the projects on lexical categories
and polysynthesis. It was through Werner Drossard's structural course, however, that I
first came to be interested in Nivkh.
My work profited greatly from discussions with and comments by Daniel Abondolo,
Christoph Benden, Bernard Comrie, William Foley, Ekaterina Jur'evna Gruzdeva, Tôru
Kaneko, Martin Haspelmath, Siri Tuttle and several audiences in Cologne, Leipzig,
Zurich, Tübingen, Leuven, and Berlin, for all of which I am really thankful. A thousand
thanks to Tarek Ahmed, Antje Casaretto, Michael Dunn, Mats Exter, Sevim Genç,
Claudia Leto, Andreas Mühlhäusler, Tomiko Murata and Georg Sachse for sharing their
expertise in Swedish, Sanskrit, Chukchi, Laz, Wichita, Japanese and phonetics with me.
Also, I appreciated so much that Hiroshi Nakagawa shared his materials with me and
introduced me to the Japanese community of Nivkh linguists. Elena Skribnik sent me
papers from Russia that I could not get ahold of here, and Carmen Dawuda showed me
the audio software which was really helpful.
To Pamela Perniss and Aria Jackson I am greatly indebted for correcting my English. I
lived through the whole thing thanks to Karsten Piaszenski's support, both moral and
technical.
Finally, I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Deutsche Forschungsge­
meinschaft (DFG). It funded the project on ""Lexikalische Kategorien und Argumentlinking in polysynthetischen Sprachen"" [Lexical categories and argument linking in po­
lysynthetic languages] as part of the special research program SFB 282 ""Theorie des Le­
xikons"" [Theory of the Lexicon] I have been working on during the writing of this
thesis.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

verbal morphology.
Turning to ditransitive verbs, we find the following two alternative objective
resultative constructions:
subject (= recipient/goal)_secondaryobject_3su-verb_yәtaḑ
subject (= patient)_primary object-verb-yәta-ḑ
The primary object principle behind these patterns is straightforward. Take a non-resultative example like

(Krejnovič 1958:31, 1937:60)
pila-zat'uyr ""big flintstone"" (zat'uyr ""flintstone"")
urla-rəuñivx ""good teacher""
(rəuñivx ""teacher"")The behavior of the initial sound of a noun after an attributive verb form as shown in
(45) lies fully within the bounds of the general principle if it is taken into account that an
attributive verb form is conceived of as ending in an elided final nasal in the Amur va­
riety. In the absence of the nasal, a noun-initial voiced plosive of set A assimilates in
voice, as a secondary morphophonemic change, to a verb root-final voiceless sound.
This occurs because phonotactics do not allow plosive or fricative+plosive clusters of
unequal voice (cf. Krejnovič 1937:62):
(49)root -ərp- ""close"" + participial -Ŋ + plosive-initial noun root təv- ""house""
→ *jərp-n-dəf participial suffix assimilates and triggers nasal alternation
→ *jərp-dəf
nasal elides
→ jərp-təf
plosive in cluster assimilatesThe same alternation of voiced and voiceless initials as in postverbal set A sounds is
found in verbal inflectional morphology, e.g. indicative -ḍ ~ -ţ and causative -gu- ~ -ku-.
