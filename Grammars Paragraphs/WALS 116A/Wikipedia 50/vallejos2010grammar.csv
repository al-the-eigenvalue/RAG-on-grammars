Note that the declarative counterparts of examples (111b-c) are complement
clauses. Thus, to negate complement clauses, the main verb is fronted, not the
subordinate verb.
Finally, in clauses that include an auxiliary, it is the auxiliary and not the main,
lexical predicate which is fronted.

9.4.1.4. Short answers to polar questions
Answers to polar questions are in principle either yes or no. Example (113a),
cited earlier as (109a), gives a question with a complement-taking verb „know‟ and a
subordinate verb „speak.‟ A positive answer to this question could minimally consist of
the main verb alone (114a), but it can also include the main and the subordinate clause
(114b), or include the subject in between the two verbs (114c)

negative marker tɨma (115a), tɨma plus the subject and the main verb (115b), and finally
tɨma plus the subject and both verbs (115c). Note that just tɨma plus the main verb is
rejected (115d), as is an answer with ni (115e).

Recall that in some questions, the piece of information under interrogation is not
the entire clause, but a portion of it. For example, in (116a), cited earlier as (109b),
where the piece under interrogation is „already come back,‟ the positive answer cannot
be the main verb alone (116b).

Content questions — also known as information questions or constituent
questions — are formed by means of interrogative words. Cross-linguistically, some of
the strategies used to form polar questions are also attested in content questions, but
their use seems less wide-spread. For instance, morphological marking and intonation
may be optional (König & Siemund 2007). This is the case in KK.
KK content questions involve interrogative pronouns, and only optionally the
interrogative morpheme =tipa. The complete set of KK interrogative words is
presented in Table 9.9, which combines Table 5.7 and Table 5:8.

„when‟As shown in Table 9.9, the language has five basic interrogative words, four of
which are used to derive many others by the addition of postpositions and544subordinators. The piece of missing information that the speaker is asking for is coded
by one of these interrogative pronouns, which must appear in sentence-initial position.
The use of the interrogative pronoun awa „who,‟ as well as other forms derived
from it, is illustrated in (117).

"Long formsLong forms are used for expressing various types of focus. Following the
typology introduced in §11.1.2, we have found that long forms are employed, for
example, in information questions and answers to those questions. This would be a case
of completive focus, in which the focused information is filling a gap in the hearer‟s722knowledge. Examples (41b, 42b) are answers to the information questions presented in
(41a, 42a). Strictly speaking, in (41b, 42b), either short or long forms could be used;
however, a long form is preferred.

Another example of completive focus using a long form pronoun is presented in(43). The speaker is describing the day that the teacher arrived in the community. A
boat was approaching the village but it was not yet close enough to identify who was
coming. The interaction of some community members in this particular context is
presented in (43). First they started guessing (43a-b). After one of them identified who
the person was, he made a strong assertion using (43c), where he uses the third person
singular long form uri to refer to the person in question.

However, in some questions, the missing information is not always the only
piece in focus. The sequence of examples in (44) comes from a story about a man who
is looking for his girlfriend in the darkness of the night. At some point, he starts calling
her:
(44)a. maka=tip(a)=ene, waina=kɨra
Where=Q=2SG.L, woman=DIM
„Where are you, little woman?‟
b. ajan=ka
etse
DEM=LOC 1SG.L.F
„Here I am‟
Note that in (44a) the second person long form appears attached to theinterrogative word, and this is the only form allowed there. Interestingly, in (44a) the
missing information is the location. However, the answer has multiple foci, „where‟ and
„who.‟ In (44b), the location appears in sentential position and the located person is
expressed by the long form.
The following examples can be characterized as contrastive-replacing focus.
Example (45) comes from a story in which a man is arguing with his mother because
she was spying on his wife. He presupposes that she does not feel responsible, so he
corrects it by means of a strong assertion in (45b). In (46) the speaker is talking about
some occasion in which he had to leave his community for work. He had decided take
his wife with him, but his wife convinced him to go alone.","[751, 752, 753]"
"Interrogative sentences
Interrogative clauses are typically used for eliciting information. The languagehas two types of questions: polar questions and content questions. Polar questions are
created by means of the second position clitic =tipa plus a word order alternation.
Information questions are formed by means of interrogative pronouns.
Faust (1972:88) claims that Kokama has a third type of interrogative
construction: indirect questions. Faust indicates that, in addition to =tipa, Kokama has
three other interrogative suffixes, -taku,-raku and -nda, which she says are employed to
create indirect questions. Cabral (1995:216, 351) echoes this claim. Here are the
examples provided by Faust (1972:88). The orthographic adaptation, glossing and
translation are mine.

(Tal vez ésa es tu mamá. ¿Es ésa, tal vez, tu mamá?)
According to my analysis, examples (102a-c) are in fact questions. They are
content questions, not because of the suffixes -nda, -raku, or -taku but rather because
they involve the interrogative pronoun awa „who.‟ Contrast these with Faust‟s example
(102d), which does not include an interrogative pronoun, and whose primary
interpretation is hence not that of a question but a weak statement (see §9.4.2 for a
discussion of content questions). As for the markers themselves, -taku (=taka, in this
variety) indicates uncertain modality (see §9.1.2.1.4). The forms -raku and -nda are not
attested in the database for this study. In conclusion, in this variety, only =tipa operates
as an interrogative marker.
In the following paragraphs I describe in some detail polar questions (§9.4.1)
and content questions (§9.4.2).
9.4.1. Polar questions
Polar question are typically employed to inquire about the truth or falsity of the
proposition they express often with focus on one specific part of the proposition (Givón
2001). Cross-linguistically, six strategies to encode polar questions have been found.
These are “(i) special intonation patterns, (ii) interrogative particles, (iii) the addition of
special tags, (iv) disjunctive-negative structures, (v) a change in the relative order of537constituents and (vi) particular verbal inflection” (König & Siemund, 2007:292). KK
employs three of these strategies to form polar questions: the interrogative particle
=tipa, constituent order alternation, and, more marginally, intonation.
9.4.1.1.","[565, 566, 567]"
"The morpheme =tipaPolar questions are primarily formed by adding the morpheme =tipa at the end
of the questioned element. Every element in the clause can be interrogated by means of
=tipa, but the questioned piece of information must occur in first position in the clause.
In the examples in (103), the piece of information being questioned is the
predicate. Note that the verb occurs in first position and then is marked by =tipa. In
intransitive constructions like in (103), the subject follows the verb; if tense occurs, it
attaches to the subject (103a-b). Schematically: [V=tipa SUB=T].
(103) a. yachu=tipa
n=uy?
cry=Q
2SG=PAS1
„Did you cry? (ED)
b. uwari=tipa
y=uy?

„Did he/she get on board? (ED)
c. tseta=tipa na=yumuyari=ay?
want=Q
2SG=help=3SG.F?
„Do you want to help her? (ED)
The declarative counterpart of example in (103c) would be the complement
clause na tseta yumuyarari=ay „You want to help her‟. Note that it is the main predicate
tseta „want‟ which is fronted and marker by =tipa, not the embedded verb „help.‟
In (104) I give yes/no questions from texts.",[567]
"Certainty =tinSpeakers use =tin to express certainty regarding the proposition expressed in a
given utterance. In elicitation, speakers told me =tin means si „yes‟, like the Spanish
conjunction to mark strong assertions. To illustrate this claim, one speaker provided me
the example in (25) that involves contrast. The context given for this example was this:
one guy and his mother have an accident and someone asks: have they died? The
answer to this question would be (25), where the first clause is a negative statement, and
the second a positive one. The speaker then translated the whole sentence into Spanish
as: la mamá no murió, él si „The mother doesn‟t die, he does‟.",[516]

9.5.","[21, 22]"
"482(20c) is clear; although it needs to be added that the uncertainty here comes mainly
from the second position marker =taka, which combines well with the clitic =á.
The functional load of the future markers is further demonstrated in the elicited
sentences in (21). Note that the sentence with a straight forward future interpretation is
(21a), with the form =utsu. The speaker explains that he would ask this question to a
person that is leaving the village in order to know when s/he is coming back. In (21b),
the form =utsu has been replaced by =á and now the interpretation turns into a
rhetorical question. This expression would be used to talk to a person that is leaving the
village for good, and there is a real chance that they will never see him/her again.
Example (21c) includes both forms, =utsu and =á: here =utsu is the andative auxiliary.
This sentence would be used to ask someone to come back; here the return of the person
is expected, so the question is not whether, but when it might happen.
(21)a. mania-puka
n=iriw=utsu
how-when
2SG=come.back=FUT1
„When will you come back?‟ (ED)
b. mania-puka

2SG=come.back=FUT2
„When might you be back.‟ [Maybe we won‟t see you again!] (ED)
c. mania-puka
n=iriw=uts=á
how-when
2SG=come.back=AUX=FUT1
„When are you going to come back? (ED)
Looking at the examples above, it seems clear that =á shows up primarily inquestions. This is further illustrated by the examples provided in (22) by the speakers
themselves, when asked for examples that would contain the future marker =á:483(22)a. uri=n=á

kamutun
want
2SG=come=FUT2
tomorrow
„Do you want to come tomorrow?‟
All the examples in (22) are polar questions (for a characterization of questions,
please see §9.4), which once again confirms the modality overtone associated with =á.
The fact that =á is extremely rare in discourse and that =utsu is the default future
marker could be clues to posit that perhaps =á is becoming obsolete. On the other hand,
as indicated earlier, it might also be a consequence of the samples of speech in my
corpus. Also, given that in every example =á is associated with low probability, an
alternative hypothesis would be that perhaps =á is turning from a future marker into a
modality marker. This seems less likely, though, as the language has additional two sets
of morphemes that encode different tones of epistemic modality. These morphemes are
addressed in the next section.
9.1.2.","[511, 512, 513]"
"672Table 11.1: Typology of focusOne issue for a theory of focus is whether contrast, belongs to sentence
grammar. A speaker‟s assumptions and expectations about the hearer‟s knowledge may
range between two extreme points: a) ignorance, the hearer does not know any of the
information; versus b) contrary belief, the hearer holds strong contrary beliefs (Givón
2001:223). Assertion involving the former can be identified as non-contrastive focus —
i.e. presentational or informational focus (Haspelmath 2001; — and assertion involving
the latter as contrastive focus. Non-contrastive focus is interpreted as new, contextincrementing information and is chosen from an open, unlimited set of possible
alternatives. Contrastive focus denotes a candidate from a limited set of contextually
given alternatives (Chafe 1976). Within this approach, the element being contrasted
needs to be already introduced or presupposed in the discourse. For Dik et al. (1981: 58)673„contrast‟ refers to cases “in which one piece of information, say x, is explicitly or
implicitly opposed to some other piece of information, say y, which stands in some
specific relation of opposition to x in the given setting”. However, based on his analysis
of stress in English, Lambrecht (1994:290) argues that, since a given sentence could
have either a contrastive or a non-contrastive interpretation depending on the
conversational context, contrast need not be reflected in sentence form. He suggests that
contrast should be treated not as a category of grammar, but as a generalized
conversational implicature. However, it has been reported that some languages have
syntactic constructions dedicated to expressing contrastive focus (Watters 1979). The
problem that prevents simple resolution of these competing empirical claims seems to
be the lack of a replicable methodology to recognize contrast in real discourse (Myhill
& Xing 1996).
In terms of scope — the syntactic domain within a sentence where the focused
piece of information is expressed — a fundamental distinction is often made in the
literature between narrow and broad focus. When a single constituent within the clause
is focused, this is called narrow focus. For non-contrastive narrow focus, Dik et al.
(1981) use the term completive focus, and Watters (1979) the term assertive focus.
Typical examples of this subtype of focus are answers to information questions (e.g.
What did Inah give to his friends? Inah gave FUFU to his friends). As mentioned
earlier, Lambrecht does not recognize different subtypes of narrow focus on the bases of
contrast; as such, he uses the term argument focus for both contrastive and noncontrastive narrow focus.","[701, 702, 703]"
"IntonationThe following polar questions are indicated only by prosody. The intonation
contour associated with questions could be described as slowly ascendant pitch plus
abrupt rising at the end. Note that every example in (109) with a different intonation
contour — relatively level pitch plus falling towards the end— would be interpreted as
a declarative sentence.

The example in (110) comes from a text. It includes the word tupa which, in that

9.4.1.3.","[569, 570]"
"Subject-verb inversionAn additional strategy to indicate polar questions is a combination of inversion
of the subject and the verb plus ascendant intonation. We have seen already that in
questions with =tipa, the piece under interrogation must be fronted. Subject-verb
inversion is different in that the verb is fronted, but not marked by =tipa. The elicited
examples in (111a-c), cited earlier as (22a-c), illustrate this pattern. This strategy is not
productive in texts.

14When tupa appears fronted in a clause it operates as interrogative pronoun „where‟; when it attaches to
a subordinated verb it functions as a relativizer of locative obliques. See Chapter X.",[570]
"709In the pragmatic dimension, the pura-marked NP expresses various subtypes of
focus, generally distinguished via constituent order. When the pura-marked NP is the O
in the SVO pattern, it correlates strongly with non-contrastive focus. When the
pura-marked NP is the O in the OSV pattern, it correlates strongly with contrastive
focus. However, in KK, Dik et al.‟s (1981) finer distinctions within the contrastive
category are neutralized. That is to say that the semantic operations such as selection,
restriction, expansion, etc., are all expressed by the same structure. To express Watters‟
exhaustive listing focus, =pura interacts with the clitic =nan „only‟.
In sentence-focus constructions, the morpheme =pura exhibits a delimitative
function. Here, =pura marks the first element of the focus domain, then focal stress
occurs towards the end of the focused unit. Interestingly, it is possible to posit that in
sentence-focus constructions, the distribution of =pura follows a nominative pattern: in
the formal dimension the subject of either intransitive or transitive clauses are
unstressed NPs and are marked by =pura. In the pragmatic dimension, the subject of the
clause is not the topic and the whole sentence is asserted. In other words, the
nominative pattern plus prosodic peak are central for distinguishing sentence focus from
the range of narrow-focus constructions. Once the hearer knows that i) the subject is
marked by =pura; and ii) it is unstressed, he knows that this is a sentence focus
construction. In contrast, once the hearer knows that i) any non-subject is marked by
=pura; and, ii) it is stressed, this is a narrow-focus construction. A less frequent pattern
(as in 31) shows that stress marks the beginning and =pura the end of the unit under710focus. An additional way of focusing the whole sentence is by attaching =pura to the
negative particle, whose scope is the entire clause.
Overall, the principal results of this study are that the clitic =pura is an important
cue to identify focus constructions — every utterance that includes =pura has a
pragmatically marked focus structure — and that the distribution and function of =pura
in KK discourse is part of a coherent functional system that cannot be understood
without considering multiple interacting factors from morphosyntax, pragmatics, and
prosody.
In §11.2.1, it was mentioned that languages express different types of focus at
the level of sentence grammar. From the two parameters that characterize focus —scope
and pragmatic information— the existence of constructions dedicated to code scope
seems clear. The results of this study support this claim. In KK, the scope of the focused
unit correlates consistently with specific structures. That is, what is clearly coded in KK
is whether a construction has narrow or broad focus structure. When focal stress and
=pura co-occur, it marks a narrow-focus construction; when the subject is marked by
=pura and is unstressed, it marks a sentence-focus construction.
The typological existence of constructions dedicated to pragmatic contrast,
however, has been in dispute. One of the most cited cases of explicit coding of contrast
is that of Aghem. The major conclusions of Watters (1979) are that Aghem has explicit
structures to express specific types of focus, but above all, that Aghem formally
distinguishes contrastive from non-contrastive focus. That is, his findings support the
idea that contrast is a possible grammatical category. However, it is risky to generalize711from his findings as his study is limited to simple-declarative sentences, which were
elicited or construed by the author and tested with one speaker (Watters 1979:141). In
contrast, other studies have found that languages often do not have constructions
devoted to specific types of focus, nor specifically to contrast (Vries 1985). In the same
vein, Lambrecht (1994), after analyzing mostly made-up examples, argues that stress in
English is by no means confined to expressing contrast. He concludes that since a
contrastive interpretation is available but not obligatory, contrast belongs to
conversational implicature rather than to grammar. Lambrecht adds that the problem
seems to be a lack of an operational definition of contrast. Myhill and Xing (1996)
attempt to solve the methodological issue on how to recognize contrast in discourse
data. They operationalize Chafe‟s (1976) definition of contrast —a set of alternatives
for the role being contrasted— and look at discourse in Chinese and Biblical Hebrew.
They conclude that neither language presents a construction devoted to contrastive
focus. Further, they suggest that a categorical correspondence between one construction
and one type of focus may not exist.
In KK, however, there are constructions that clearly distinguish contrastive from
non-contrastive focus. Recall from §11.2.3.2 that 83% (n=74) of the [O=pura S V]
constructions expressed contrast following the operational definition proposed by
Myhill and Xing‟s (1996). The remaining examples (n=15, 17%) did not fulfill Myhill
and Xing‟s requirement as clear alternatives could not be traced in the previous
discourse, or, in Lambrecht‟s words, the relevant presuppositions were not always
lexico-grammatically evoked. Interestingly, also Myhill and Xing did find “clear cases712of implicit contrast” (1996:320). However, in KK, this subset of examples can be
accounted for when we recognize that contrast can be built on the basis of shared
cultural knowledge. Although operational definitions are important as a means of
avoiding circularity, we cannot ignore the danger of restricting our attention to only
overtly stated discourse context and thereby underestimating the importance of the
“universe of discourse.” In conclusion, KK suggests that we need to provide a place in
the grammar for dedicated contrastive focus constructions.
11.3. Selection of pronominal forms: grammar and discourse
As introduced in Chapter III, and pointed out throughout this dissertation, KK
has three sets of forms for expressing pronominal referents: long form free pronouns,
short form free pronouns, and enclitics. Upon looking at them, some questions arise: do
the different forms correspond to different meanings or functions? If yes, what kinds of
factors drive the choice of one form or another at the moment of the utterance? This
section is an attempt to answer those questions by examining natural discourse.
11.3.1. Assumptions and hypothesis
It has been noticed that the structure of expressions and their conceptualizations
seems to follow certain general principles. The principle of iconicity assumes that: i)
ideally, there is a coding relationship between one expression and one meaning, and ii)
the conceptual simplicity of a notion corresponds to the simplicity of its expression
(Croft 1993, Givón 1985, 1991, Haiman 1983). For example, the formal distance
between linguistic expressions may be an iconically motivated index of the conceptual
distance between the terms or events that they denote. It is also argued that functional-713cognitive principles, such as economy of mental effort, mediate specific instances of
iconicity in grammar (Givon 1991).
As for the existence of multiple forms with the “same” referent in the languages of
the world, Haiman (1983) points out:
Through sound change or borrowing, a language acquires doublets -more
or less synonymous ways of saying the same thing. […] True synonyms do
not long endure: presented with a minimally contrasting pair of
expressions, speakers will attempt to associate appropriately contrasting
meaning with them. What seems „appropriate‟ to speakers may often be
what is iconically motivated (Haiman 1983:800).
Though the existence of multiple forms could have historical explanations, I will
do not discuss their history here. Rather, what I want to explore is the modern forces
that drive their distribution in natural texts.
A first look at the properties of pronominal forms in the language indicates that
in certain constructions, only certain pronominal forms are allowed, whereas in others,
any pronominal form is accepted. The hypothesis behind this section is then that, in
constructions where multiple forms are grammatical, the pragmatic information status
of the referent correlates with speaker‟s choices of pronominal forms in actual use. That
is, speakers, by using these three sets of forms, give different amounts of information to
the hearers, establishing an iconic relationship between the phonological size of the
grammatical form and the amount of information that it carries. By “amount of
information” I mean the quality and quantity of semantic-pragmatic instructions that the714speaker gives in order for the hearer to build mental representations within the universe
of discourse.
Since personal pronouns are definite and referring by definition, notions such as
referentiality and definiteness do not seem to be helpful in explaining the data.
However, I will refer to the pragmatic function of focus as introduced in §11.1.2,
because it proves to be relevant in describing the functions of the different pronominal
forms in KK.
11.3.2. Long forms, short forms and clitics
As introduced in Chapter V, KK has three sets of pronominal forms: long form
free pronouns, short form free pronouns, and enclitics. The language also distinguishes
between masculine speech (MS) and feminine speech (FS) in the pronominal
paradigms; gender is marked according to the speaker and not in reference to what they
are talking about. The opposition between long and short free pronouns is only available
in the singular — specifically in first person feminine speech, second person feminine
and masculine speech, and third person masculine speech, whereas the opposition
between independent forms versus enclitics is present through the whole paradigm.
The complete paradigm of pronouns for female speech (FS) and male speech
(MS) is resented in Table 11.3. Notice the differences in form according to speaker‟s
gender for first singular, third singular, first plural exclusive and third plural. There is
an additional set of enclitic forms exclusively for third person object that were not
included in the table below. These are: =ay / =ura for female/male speech respectively.","[738, 739, 740, 741, 742, 743, 744]"

"72911.4. The pragmatics of constituent order patterns
Starting with Greenberg (1963), there has been a fundamental assumption in
linguistics that for a majority of languages it is possible to identify a “basic” order of
subject and object with respect to the verb (Hawkins 1983, Nichols 1986, Dryer 1988,
among others). This constitutes one way of categorizing languages in typology.
However, what is basic and how to identify it remains debatable. None of the
standard strategies to detect basic word order — statistical frequency, descriptive
simplicity, and pragmatic neutrality —is without problems. As a result, some scholars
have questioned the universality of the very notion of basic word order; when languages
display several order patterns, instead of asking “what is the basic order”, some scholars
advocate asking a different question, namely “what is the communicative function of
one order, rather than another” (Mithun 1992, Payne 1990, 1992). Thus, the first
typological division should be made between those languages in which word order
primarily correlates with grammatical factors, and those in which word order primarily
correlates with pragmatic factors (Thompson 1978).
The speakers of KK have several constituent order patterns at their disposal, and
this section explores the factors that speakers take into consideration when choosing one
of those patterns at the moment of the utterance. It was found that some patterns are
used to mark certain pieces of information as pragmatically salient. Here I use salient in
the sense of Mithun‟s (1993) newsworthy, for referring to unexpected information (i.e.
which breaks shared cultural knowledge and expectations), answers to information
questions, restatements, topic shifting, etc. In Givón‟s words, salient information would730be considered more informative than non/less-salient information. Informativeness can
be seen as a composite of several parameters: it correlates with new as opposed to
given, indefinite as opposed to definite, contrastive as opposed to non-contrastive. In
general, it involves less predictable information (Givon 1983).
11.4.1. Available ordering patterns
As discussed in Chapters IX, §9.1.1, in KK word order partially defines the
syntactic role of an argument. Although neither tense nor aspect morphology is required
as part of a basic clause, a clause allows a different order of subject, object and verb
depending on whether or not it is marked for progressive aspect. The available patterns
are listed in Table 11.6; for examples that illustrate these patterns, please see Chapter
VIII.15

tsɨki‘sing’‘breath’*ekara, *ɨkara
*tseki, *tsikiThe existence of three distinct phonemes in a small perceptual space goes
against some basic assumptions about phonological systems. It is assumed that the main
objective of the speakers is to be understood by the listener; thus, most aspects of
phonological systems that are universal or widely attested could be explained in terms
of two constraints. On the one hand, they derive from the requirement of sufficient
distinctiveness or enough perceptual contrast; and, on the other hand, from the principle
of least effort — speakers spend no more energy than necessary in production (Diehl et
al. 2001). In addition, the Adaptive Dispersion Theory predicts that vowels will be
dispersed in the perceptual space to the extent needed to provide sufficient
discrimination among vowels (Lindblom 1986). After comparing 209 languages,
Crothers (1978), as reported by Lindblom (1986), argues that the vowels of a system
can be predicted by the size of the inventory. He says that the smallest system has three
vowels: [i, u, a]. In four-vowel systems there are two possibilities, either [ɛ] or [ɨ] is
added, the first option being the most common. In five-vowel systems, both [ɛ,] and [ɔ]
are added. He adds that the pattern of five vowel qualities seems to be the norm
cross-linguistically.
KK has five vowels, but the apparent fact that three out of the five vowels are
located in the front area deviates from the above predictions. Then, the question is,
would an acoustic study confirm that three phonemes are in fact placed in a small area
of the vowel space? If this is the case, why would a language exhibit such overlap? The
137preliminary study described in the next section answers the first question, and begins to
explore the second.
3.5.2. Data and methodology
The results presented in this section include the analysis of two types of data:
minimal pairs and words both in isolation and in a sentence frame. As for the first type
of data, six minimal pairs and three quasi-minimal pairs were recorded from one female
and one male speaker. The speakers said each word twice. The rationale for doing this
was that we expected that the speakers would pay special attention to their production
and try to consciously produce the minimal pairs in a contrastive way. As for the second
type of data, 58 words were selected and produced in isolation and in a sentence frame,
again by the same male and female speaker (see Appendix B). The selected tokens
represent the vowels within all the syllable types. The carrier phrase was: ikian ______
ta kumitsay, for the male speaker, and ajan______ tsa kumitsay, for the female speaker,
both meaning ―this ______ I said.‖ Next, I meassured the F1 and F2 values for all the
vowels. Possible correlations with stress, length, position within the syllable or the
word, surrounding consonants, etc. were examined, but none of them seemed to have
any effect on the values of the formants.
3.5.3. Results
The results for minimal pairs are presented in Figure 3.3, and the results for the
words in isolation and in the sentence frame in Figure 3.4.","[165, 166, 167]"

Table 10.6.
i)All of them exhibit the male-speech (MS) versus female-speech (FS)
opposition.ii)Synchronically, some of them, but not all, can be further analyzed into
smaller pieces (indicated by hyphens in the table).iii)Even the constructions that cannot be analyzed further involve
phonological pieces (ria, rae,) which strongly resemble pronominal
forms for third person male-speech (ra, uri, =ura). More importantly,
this is also true for the set of female-speech forms, which include forms
(iya/yae) that also bear a resemblance to third person female-speech
pronominals (ya, ay).iv)In addition to the third-person-like element, these constructions involve
adverbial subordinators (i.e., -ikua „reason‟, -npu „later‟), postpositions649(i.e., =tsui „ablative‟, =ka, „locative), as well as the nominalizer -n, and
the marker of restrictive focus =nan.
In what follows I discuss the form and function of each of these conjunctions,
beginning with those that have double functions.
10.5.2.1 . Coupling: riay/yay ‘also/and’
In KK, two clauses can be conjoined by adding the particle riay/yay between the
two. This is illustrated in (113). In (113a), both the subject and the verb are identical, so
they can be omitted in the second clause. Speakers say that omitting the verb in (113b)
could result in an odd sentence. The reason for this is that if the verb is omitted, the
tense marker would have to attach to the pronominal subject, and that pattern is not
allowed in the language.

proposition is equivalent to the simple clause in (114b), in which both subjects are
replaced by a plural pronoun.","[677, 678, 679]"

"503The semantics of =era is somehow complex. It not only indicates that the event
expressed in the utterance is non-factual but also involves what Lichtenberck
(1995:293) calls an apprehensional-epistemic, a mixture of epistemic and attitudinal
meanings having to do with “the speaker‟s degree of certainty about the factual status of
a proposition and with his or her attitude concerning the desirability of the situation
encoded in the clause.” To be more precise, =era signals that the situation is not only
uncertain but in some way undesirable, which makes the speaker nervous, or
“apprehensive.”6
In the text database, the morpheme =era appears primarily in questions, more
rarely in declarative sentences. In their discourse context, these are in fact rhetorical
questions; they are not used with the expectation of eliciting a piece of information, but
to express a speculative comment about inexplicable, enigmatic events that involve fear.
Examples (47) to (51) illustrate the use of =era. The discourse context is provided for
each example.

However, the certainty marker does not indicate or correlate with contrast, as isdemonstrated in examples from connected speech. In the text database, the utterances
highlighted as certain are consistently presented as factual events. This is exemplified in
(26). Note that =tin attaches to the first constituent of the clause, which in (26a-b)
happens to be the subject and in (26c) the temporal demonstrative raepe „then.‟

Examples in (26a-c) present events as realized and concluded. However, the
utterance under speaker‟s evaluation can also make reference to events that have been
happening from an earlier point in time, but which still apply at the moment of the
utterance. For instance, example (27a) is taken from a context in which the speaker says
the Kokamas have traditionally had big families. He says that this has been true in the
past and is still true now. Example (27b) shows a similar temporal scenario. The context
for this example is this: leaders from several villages traveled to a city and received488some donations. The speaker says that the other leaders decided to give the heavy stuff
to him because his village is closer to the city, the other leaders live further away. The
fact that he will go to a close place is presented as certain, and it will surely continue to
be certain after the moment of the utterance. Similarly, in (27c) the fact that „over there
the dollar doesn‟t exist‟ has a habitual reading.

dollarExample in (28) is interesting in terms of the placement of =tin. The portion
chɨpɨ-yara=tin=ura „it is costly‟ is a non-verbal predicate and is produced without
pauses. However, chɨpɨ-yara „has a price‟ is the predicate phrase, and ura indicates the
subject „it‟. So, =tin attaches to the predicate phrase, which is the first constituent in the
clause and then the pronoun follows.

(Lit. They know to make it. It does have a price.)489As mentioned earlier, in elicitation speakers relate the certainty marker with
Spanish si „yes.‟ The reason for that is perhaps the fact that the form -ti, which by
speakers‟ intuitions is related to -tin, sporadically shows up in short-positive answers.
This is not the typical pattern for short answers, though, as will be shown in §9.4.1. The
following exchange comes from a text about the presence of the Kokama-Kokamillas in
this area of the Amazon. Speaker A asserts that Kokamas can be found in a particular
village. Speaker B agrees with the propositional content of Speaker A‟s utterance by
using -ti. The appearance of -ti in the database is extremely rare.

„Yes, also (there)‟This brings us to the clitic =tika which shows up in a few utterances in my
corpus. Interestingly enough, =tika seems to contain =ti. However, there are reasons to
not categorize =tika as another member of the set MOD1. The main reason for not
doing that is that the set of MOD1 clitics do not co-occur. Although =tika is a second
position clitic, it does co-occur with =tin, as in (30). In that sense =tika behaves
differently than the others.

certainty is also expected from the addressee. In every instance of =tika, the utterance
makes reference to a proposition which is assumed to be also known by the hearer. The
semantics of =tika could be paraphrased as “it is true, you and I know that.” Consider
the examples in (31) which come from two traditional stories. The last portion of (31a)
could be paraphrased „as you and I know, shamans sing cure-songs.‟ Example in (31b)
implies that both speaker and addressee know about this creature called ururi.

„The soul of the ururi (legendary creature) IS an animal‟
The marker =tika also combines with the negative particle tɨma. In these cases
the negative marker does not have scope over the proposition. On the contrary, the
sequence tɨma-tika is translated into Amazonian Spanish as No pues/no es cierto? „Isn‟t
it true?‟ and the resulting sentences get interpreted as rhetorical questions (cf. 32). In
(32a), the proposition „woman throw blood monthly‟ is not negated but positively
asserted. The discourse context for (32b) is this: a man sees someone and takes a guess
that is his son; then his wife clarifies that that is not their son by reminding him their491son went somewhere else. That is, in (32b) she not only asserts that „he went to the
forest‟ but tɨmatika works as a reminder, implying that he knows that.

The fact that =tin, =ti, and =tika are not only phonologically related but also
semantically associated with strong assertions suggests a connection among them. It
could be hypothesized, for instance, that the certainty marker =tin consists of -ti plus the
nominalizer -n. At this point, however, this will have to remain as an untestable
hypothesis.

11.5.3. Conclusions
The goal of the study presented in this section was to answer two questions i)
How often do speakers employ tense-marked clauses, progressive-marked clauses, and
unmarked clauses? 1) What drives the distribution of tense-marked clauses and
progressive-marked clauses in discourse?
With respect to the first question, this study found that the distribution of the
tense-marked clauses, progressive-marked clauses, and unmarked clauses is very
assymetrical, with tense-marked clauses in only about 12% of the IUs in the database
and progressive clauses which only appear in 3% of the units. The vast majority of IUs,
(about 86%), are unmarked clauses with respect to tense and progressive aspect.
As for the second question, there is a strong association between progressive
constructions and background or supportive information. Progressive-marked clauses
signal descriptive, often evaluative information that breaks the temporal sequence of
747main events. Second, the mainline or foreground information is mostly signaled by
unmarked clauses. The temporal frame is established at the beginning of the discourse
by means of adverbs and/or tense-marked clauses. Third, the appearance of tensemarked clauses is less clear; they tend to occur at key moments of the plot to reaffirm
the temporal frame, or to manipulate the temporal-deictic point. Even though these
results support Hopper‟s assertion (1979) that the foreground/background distinction is
a universal of some kind, the predictions are strong from structure to function, but less
strong in the opposite direction.","[774, 775, 776, 777]"
"Roots, stems and words
In this study, roots are defined as the portion of a word that is not furtheranalyzable into meaningful elements, being morphologically simple, and which
contains the main portion of meaning of the words in which it appears (Haspelmath
2002, T. Payne 1997). Examples of roots are presented in (1).
(1)anaru „to be wrapped‟
chira „name‟
irua „brother, relative, community member‟
A stem is the root of a word, together with any derivational affixes —or anyother roots or stems in compounds— to which other inflectional affixes can be added.
Building on the roots presented in (1), examples in (2) illustrate stems.

morphemes. That is, a word can be equated to a root, a stem, or a stem plus inflectional
affixes or clitics. In KK, however, the main criterion for identifying words is primary
stress (see §2.2.3). In addition to examples in (1) and (2), words are further illustrated in

Given the lack of obligatory morphology associated with particular classes, these sets
are defined on syntactic grounds. The structural criteria associated with prototypical

sentence types and speech acts is by no means one-to-one. For instance, although in KK
declarative sentences are employed primarily to make statements and claims about the
world, in the appropriate context they can also be employed to elicit information, to
convey a request, to express a wish, etc.
I start the discussion with an outline of a simple verbal clause construction in
KK (§9.1). Here I list the main elements that occur within a simple verbal clause. Next I
discuss constituent ordering, a key aspect in the characterization of verbal constructions
in KK (§9.1.1). In KK, two grammatical categories that are typically characterized at
the verb-level, in other languages must be described at the clause level. These are tense
(§9.1.1.3) and modality (9.1.2).
The second part of this chapter is dedicated to the grammatical devices that the
language employs to perform different speech acts. In §9.2, I describe declarative
sentences. I start with a formal characterization of the grammatical relations of subject
and object, and contrast them with obliques (§9.2.1), and then discuss the functional
load of declarative sentences (§9.2.2). From a semantic-functional perspective,
negative clauses could be considered a subtype of declarative clauses; however, for
reasons of clarity in the presentation, they are discussed in their own section (§9.3). In
§9.4, I present interrogative sentences, including polar and content questions. Directive
sentences, discussed in §9.5, is a category that subsumes several constructions,
including imperative, polite imperative, exhortative, jussive, invitation, prohibition, and
future/irrealis prohibition.","[492, 493]"

farTo close this section, it is possible to say that the most productive devices for
interrogation in KK are the morpheme =tipa and interrogative pronouns. In theory,
every piece of information contained in a sentence can be interrogated by simply
placing it in sentence-initial position and marking it with =tipa. Content questions are
formed by means of interrogative pronouns which must appear fronted; =tipa is optional
in this type of question. KK has a small set of interrogative pronouns; however, on the
basis of this small set many others can be derived by means of postpositions and
546subordinators. Intonation alone and subject-verb inversion are less productive
mechanism for forming questions.
9.5. Directive sentences
Directive sentences are those by which we try to get others to do things (Searle
1980). In other words, the main function of directive clauses is to get or advise the
hearer to do something. In KK, the category of directive sentences subsumes a range of
subtypes, among which are included imperatives, hortatives, jussives, rogatives,
postponed prohibitives, and others, and whose illocutionary force goes from orders and
requests to exhortations, suggestions, wishes, petitions and warnings. Directives have
neither tense nor modality marking, except for rogatives and prohibitives, which can
take the certainty marker -tin to add overtones of irony and sarcasm to rogatives and
emphasis to prohibitives. A list of the attested constructions is presented in Table 9.10.

clauses are special inflectional forms of the verb, suppression of the subject, directive
markers, use of bare stems, etc. (König & Siemund 2007). The main strategies KK
employ is suppression of the subject and directive markers. In the subsequent sections I
present each construction in detail.
9.5.1. Imperatives
The term imperative here is reserved for sentence types directed to the
addressee, that is, those sentences with an understood second person subject. The most
basic imperative construction in KK is formed by suppressing the subject, leaving the
verb and potentially an auxiliary. If the verb is transitive, then an object follows the
verb. Schematically: [V (AUX) (OBJ)]. The prosody of imperative sentences is quite
distinctive. They are generally fast paced and have higher pitch, strong intensity in the
last stressed syllable, and abrupt falling intonation.
In (121) I give imperative sentences with intransitive verbs. Note in (121b) that
the auxiliary uri ‘venitive‟ attaches to the verb. The examples in (122) give imperative
sentences with transitive verbs.

c. tsakɨta

uka ɨwa=ra
cut
tree
1PL.IN house trunk=PUR
„Cut the tree for (to use it as) the post of our house‟
As stated above, the default subject is second person singular. However, in
imperative clauses that include pronouns acting as the possessor of the object, a plural
addressee could be implied. This is shown in (123); note the plural pronoun in (123b).
(123) a. tsukuta
na
chiru
Wash
2SG cloth
„Wash your clothes!‟ (ED)
b. tsukuta
epe chiru
wash
2PL cloth
„Wash your (pl.) clothes‟ (ED)
In terms of the functional load of the imperative construction [V (AUX) (OBJ)],
according to the consultants, the examples in (121)-(123) imply some irritation on the
part of the speaker. For instance, it could be that the speaker expected the addressee to
have performed the tasks indicated in the predicate but he/she did not. Another possible
scenarios would be that the addressee refuses to do something, but by using this
construction the speaker signals that performing the tasks is unavoidable.
In everyday speech, the imperative construction is not the most frequent pattern
among the several directive constructions the language possesses. Compared to the
frequency of exhortatives, jussives, invitations, etc., the imperative is seldom used. In
the database they appear rarely and mainly in direct quotes, as in (124).","[574, 575, 576, 577, 578]"

The interrogative =tipa can also attach to the negative particle to question the
entire clause. For instance, in (108), what is being qestioned is the claim: „You wouldn‟t

"505Examples from (47) to (51) demonstrate the use of =era in questions, or in
utterances following a question (as in (48)). Examples in (52) and (53) show its
appearance in declaratives. Note that speculation and fear are constant.

she becomes transformed into an animal:

„This poor thing seems to be in absolute pain; it‟s bleeding all over‟
Examples (47) to (51) illustrate a frequent combination, the apprehensivemarker =era with the second position speculative =ray. Because of this frequent
co-occurrence, it could be thought that perhaps =era carries only attitudinal meanings.
However, =era does not need to co-occur with =ray to convey epistemic uncertainty.
This is demonstrated in (47), (52), and (53), which do not include =ray, yet still convey
both uncertainty and apprehension. This has also been confirmed in elicitation. Beyond
=ray and =era, other combinations of modality markers are also possible. These
combinations are the topic of the next section.
9.1.2.2.3.","[534, 535]"
"674It is in the area of narrow plus contrastive focus where the typologies under
discussion differ the most. While Watters (1979) suggests two subtypes, Dik et al.
(1981) propose five subtypes. Watters proposes counter-assertive focus (“information
the speaker substitutes for a previous utterance asserted by the hearer”, e.g. Inah gave
FUFU to his friends {not yams}) and exhaustive listing focus (“the sentence is true
only with respect to this piece of information, and false with respect to other possible
alternatives”, e.g. Inah gave FUFU ONLY to his friends). Dik et al. identify these same
subtypes, calling the former replacing focus (i.e. a specific item in the pragmatic
information of the hearer is removed and replaced by another correct item), and the
latter restrictive focus (i.e. the presupposed set is restricted to one or more values).
However, Dik et al. (1981) specify that these subtypes should be characterized as
counter-presuppositional rather than counter-asserted because, according to them, what
matters is not what the hearer said, but the speaker's assumptions about the hearer‟s
pragmatic information at the time of the utterance. In addition, Dik et al.‟s typology
distinguishes the following subtypes: selective focus (selecting an item from a set of
presupposed possibilities, e.g. Did John buy coffee or rice? John bought RICE),
expanding focus (adding information to the antecedently presupposed information, e.g.
John bought rice. Yes, but he also bought COFFEE), and parallel focus (two pieces of
information are contrasted within one linguistic unit, e.g. JOHN bought RICE, but
PETER bought COFFEE).
Broad focus refers to constructions where the focus domain includes more than a
single constituent. If the focus domain is the whole sentence and it has non-contrastive675interpretation, Dik et al. calls it predication focus, and Watters polar focus. Watters‟
polar focus occurs when “the truth value „true‟ or „false‟ is asserted or counter-asserted”
(e.g. Inah DID give fufu to his friends). For Lambrecht, if the focus domain includes all
but the subject, this is predicate focus (recall that for him this is the pragmatically
unmarked focus construction); however, if it includes the whole sentence, this is
sentence focus (e.g. What happened? My CAR broke down.) Finally, Watters also
distinguishes sentence focus constructions with contrastive interpretation. He refers to
the latter as counter-assertive polar focus defined as “the speaker‟s reply contradicting
the hearer‟s assertion about the truth value „true‟ or „false‟ of the sentence” (e.g. Inah
DID TOO give FUFU to his friends). While for Lambrecht, counter-assertive polar
focus may be a potential subtype of focus, Dik et al. refers to both Watters‟ asserted and
counter-asserted polar focus as predication focus.
The grammar of KK provides an opportunity to test the distinctions between the
typologies presented above. The morpheme =pura is mainly concerned with
information structure; it guides the hearer about how particular sentences, and pieces of
sentences, relate to the overall discourse. Examining the uses of =pura turns out to take
us well beyond the morpheme itself, to a set of constructions involving the interaction
of =pura with other morphemes, constituent order and stress. On the one hand, KK
appears to lack grammar devoted to coding several of the distinctions suggested by Dik
et al.; on the other hand, KK has a distinct construction dedicated to coding narrow
focus contrast, which appears to force Lambrecht‟s model to acknowledge the relevance
of that category in theories of the grammar of focus.","[703, 704, 705]"

On the basis of these hints provided by some speakers, it is possible tohypothesize that perhaps in sequences of RC-N and N-RC, the preceding element
modifies the second. Cross-linguistically, the primary function of relative clauses is to
restrict the set of potential referents of the head noun; crucially, the propositional
content of restrictive relative clauses is pressuposed, that is, known and accessible to the
hearer. However, there are also non-restrictive relative clauses, in which the event or
state encoded in the relative clause is “typically not presupposed, but is rather asserted
as new information” (Givón 2001:179). Non-restrictive relative clauses are also refered
to as parenthetical assertions (which just happen to use the same grammar as relative
clauses). Importantly, not only semantic but also formal differences seem to exist
between the two constructions.
In the following sections, I explore the formal features and the (non-)
restrictiveness function of prenominal and postnominal RCs in KK by looking for
patterns of distribution in the connected speech in my text database. Preliminary results
show that both postnominal and prenominal relative clauses partially can play a role in
restrictiveness: relative clauses that precede the head noun can have either restrictive
function or non-restrictive function, whereas relative clauses that follow the head noun609are only restrictive. Prenominal relative clauses seem to be more tighly bound
syntactically to their heads, as compared to postnominal relative clauses. The syntactic
tightness of the relative clause and its head noun can be evaluated by looking at whether
interceding material can be placed between the two, including clitics for tense, plural
and focus, as well as temporal adverbials and pauses. Not all of these patterns are
attested in the text database; if a pattern has been attested only in elicitation, this is
explicitly indicated ( ED is added immediately following the translation.) Because a
preceding noun can modify a head noun within a noun phrase, in Table 10.2 there is a
column dedicated to the sequence N-N, to compare it with relative clauses —i.e.,
clausal nominalizations — that precede the head (RC-N) and follow it (N-RC).

The examples in (65-66) demonstrate that the relative clause can have its own
tense frame. If the order is RC-N, as in (65), then tense attaches to the head noun (65a)
or to the right edge of the RC (65b), between the RC and N. If the order is N-RC, as in
(66), the tense clitic can attach to the end of the RC (66a), but the tense clitic does not
appear between N and RC (66b); that is, in this pattern the head noun cannot carry the
tense clitic. However, note that in (66c), where the NP occurs in the canonical position
for O, the head noun carries the tense clitic and the consultant does not find this
example as ill formed as (66b). The question mark in (66c) means “I can understand it,
but I wouldn‟t say it.” What happens is this: the word order here is SVO, which means
the relative clause occurs at the end of the clause. Tense markers in this position are
possible if the noun carrying the tense clitic and the following relative clause do not
constitute a single unit. In other words, the tense marker breaks this sequence into two
noun phrases, a noun and a headless relative clause, which are now in an appositive
relationship. For instance, the consultants add that (66c) would be better if a small pause
is added after yawar=uy.","[637, 638, 639, 640]"

epenthetic vowel -i is inserted after it. That is: aja=n=nu > ajaminu (see also §2.4.6).

clause specifies the purpose of the event expressed in the matrix clause. The context is
the following: the speaker is talking about his visit to Guatemala. He mentions that his
host took him on a tour to visit several places. In this example, the subordinate clause is
„to see their old town‟. Looking at the prosody, (10) includes a clear stress on =pura,

What needs to be noticed about example (10) is that, within the discourse context,
it would not be responding to a question like „what did they take you for?‟ but to a
question like „what did they take you to see?‟ Thus, the focused portion, „their old
town‟, is the O argument of the subordinate verb „see‟. This means two things: i) it is
unlikely that we can interpret the whole subordinate clause as being in focus; 5 and, ii)
the presupposition for this utterance contains an open variable, i.e. it does not evoke a
set of variables.
(10‟) Presupposition: <they took us to see X>; assertion: <X=the old town>5There are other utterances containing =pura in which the stress is upon other elements of the
subordinate clause. In the example below, for instance, the stress is on the verb „be cold‟. Thus, „because
they feel cold‟ is in focus. Cases like this are better analyzed as broad focus constructions (see Section
4.2).

expressing the reason why the event in the matrix clause is realized. In (11), the speaker
is talking about an earthquake that destroyed the city. The subordinate clause is
„because the earthquake destroyed all their houses‟, but the part under the scope of
=pura is the NP „all their houses‟, i.e. the O argument of „destroy‟. Notice the stress on
„all‟. In the communicative context, this construction is not about „why they left,‟ but
about „what the earthquake destroyed.‟

verbs, the function of the completive here is similar to what has been described for basic

of information per se, but the commitment of the speaker with respect to the truth value
of the proposition. MOD1 includes the uncertainty marker =taka „maybe (UNC)‟, the
certainty marker =tin „for sure (CER)‟, the speculative marker =ray „it seems (SPE)‟,
and the reportative or hearsay =(i)a „it is said (REP)‟. As second position markers, they
attach to whichever element occurs first in the clause.
The following elicited examples illustrate this four-way opposition:

or someone else is traveling. The range of possible answers includes:

Second position clitics indicate various degrees of certainty towards realized and
unrealized events. A clear evidence of this is that the set of MOD1 can combine with
tense clitics within a single clause, as shown in (24).

In what follows, I describe each of these markers, from highest to lowest degreeof certainty.

"681Generally, =pura occurs appended to the last word of a constituent or phrase
(e.g., 3a-d). On nouns, however, =pura exhibits an odd distribution because it occupies
a slot position close to the root. That is, it shows up between derivational morphemes
and the evaluative morphemes, as shown in the following examples:
(4) tsuwɨ=pura
yawati=pura=tua=nu
panara-pan=pura=kanablood=FOC
„the blood‟
turtle=FOC=AUG=PL.F „the huge turtles‟
banana-DER=FOC=PL.M „the banana farms‟The distribution of =pura in natural discourse raises questions regarding its
function. If =pura is a focus marker, what type(s) of focus does it express? That is, how
does the function of =pura fit in the typology of focus? Does =pura encode focus
independently from other widely attested mechanisms, such as stress and constituent
order, or does it interact with such mechanisms to produce formal distinctions resulting
in various subtypes of focus? The remainder of this section addresses these questions.
The database for this study is a portion of the texts described earlier (§2.9). The
texts altogether consist of about 2539 intonation units, among which 351 instances of
the focus morpheme =pura have been identified. Thus, this morpheme occurs in about
14% of all intonation units.
11.2.2. The scope and function of =pura: an overview
In order to understand the function of =pura in discourse, one has to understand
how this morpheme behaves in the internal structure of sentences themselves. From a
morphosyntactic point of view, =pura can be associated with specific particles, NPs,
verbs and sentences. In this section I argue that the focus domain and the focus subtype
are marked by a combination of =pura, constituent order and stress.","[710, 711]"
"1624.5.1.4. Oblique postpositions
In the language, nominal phrases in oblique function are morphologically
marked by postpositions. These markers appear appended to the right most element of
the phrase There are several markers, including: =ka ‘locative/allative‟, ablative =tsui
‘ablative‟, =rupe „finalative‟, =ri ‘diffuse locative‟, =kuara ‘inessive‟, =muki
„comitative‟, =ra „purpose‟, etc.
Examples in (27) illustrate some of the postpositions. In (34a), the scope of the
morpheme =ka is the phrase „my mother‟s house‟. In (34b), the finalative =rupe marks
„our tent‟; (34c) shows the inessive =kuara on „water‟; and in (34d) the scope of the
„locative diffuse‟ is „your belly‟.

Examples in (29) shows some examples with non-directional postpositions. In

Similarly, the scope of =ra in (29c), is the phrase „my house‟.

4.5.2. Second position clitics
Second position clitics occur after the first major constituent of the sentence. In
contrast with the phrasal clitics, second position clitics exhibit very few restrictions with
respect to their phonological hosts. Clitics that fall in this category may attach to a
noun phrase or pronoun in A, S, O, or oblique functions, an interrogative word,
intersentential conjunction, or any other constituent occurring in sentence initial
position. The most frequent second position clitics are the interrogative =tipa, the
modals =tin „certainty‟,=taka, „uncertainty‟, =ray ‘speculative‟ and =ía „reportative‟.
4.5.2.1. Interrogative =tipa
KK has a few interrogative constructions including the specialized clitic =tipa.
In both polar questions and information questions this morpheme appears appended to
the first element in the clause. The examples below demonstrate that polar interrogative164constructions can be described as the result of modifying a declarative sentence (29a).
Examples (29b-c) show that second position is the only slot in the sentence this clitic
can occupy, all other possibilities yielding ungrammatical utterances (29d-e).1
(29)a. ene erura ipir=uy
2
bring fish=PAS1
„You brought fish‟
b. ene-tipa
erura ipir=uy
2-Q
bring fish=PAS1
„You brought fish?‟
c. ipira-tipa n=erur=uy
fish-Q
2SG=bring=PAS1
„Fish you brought?‟
d. *ene erura-tipa ipir=uy
e. *ene erura ipir=uy=tipa
f. *na=tipa erura ipir=uy
As we see in (29), =tipa can attach to nouns and pronouns. Comparing (29b) and(29f), the only difference between the two is the form of the second person pronoun.
This demonstrates that if the element being suffixed by =tipa is a pronoun it must be in
the long form (29b); in other words, =tipa on short form pronouns or clitic pronouns
produces ungrammatical sentences (29f).
However, =tipa can also appear appended to elements from other categories, as
it will be demonstrated in Chapter IX, under interrogative constructions §9.4.1.","[191, 192, 193, 194]"
"481.6.2. Construction grammar
According to Constructionist approaches, constructions are “learned pairings of
form with semantic or discourse function, including morphemes or words, idioms,
partially lexically filled, and general phrasal patterns.” (Goldberg 2006:5). That is,
constructions are represented as symbolic units in their own right, just as lexical items
such as verbs are. It follows that, within this view, lexicon and grammar are not distinct
components, but form a continuum of constructions. Since evidence for categorization
is also found beyond language, contrary to the nativist view, construction grammar
posits that children learn constructions from the input; that is, they make generalizations
from instances.
Further, constructions form an interrelated network. For instance, simple clause
constructions reflect scenes basic to human experience, “such as that of someone
causing something to move or change state, someone experiencing something,
something moving, and so on” (Goldberg 1995:5). Goldberg (1995) emphasizes that a
linguistic pattern must be recognized as a construction as long as some aspect of its
form, meaning, or function is not predictable from its component parts or from other
constructions that exist in a given language. She adds, however, that patterns are stored
even if they are fully predictable as long as they occur with sufficient frequency. Given
the following sentences:
(3)a. Joe bought a book
b. Joe bought Tom a book
c. Joe gave Tom a bookTransitive construction
Ditransitive construction
Ditransitive construction49While (3a) entails getting an item, (3b) entails getting an item plus intended
transfer of it. According to non-constructionist approaches, the form and general
interpretation of basic sentence patterns of a language are determined by semantic
and/or syntactic information specified by the main verb. Thus, buy in (3b) does not
mean the same thing as buy in (3a), and so there must be a rule deriving buy in (3b)
from buy in (3a), which allows it to be used with the appropriate meaning in the
construction in (3b).
On the contrary, within the constructionist approach the meaning of (3a) and
(3b) are determined by the constructions themselves. The additional component of
meaning in (3b) is analyzed not as a part of the lexical content of the verb, but as a part
of the meaning of the Ditransitive construction. That is, in English, the Ditransitive
construction is an independently represented syntactic unit. As such, it possesses its
own semantics —<X CAUSES Y to RECEIVE Z>, as well as its own form —[SUB V
OBJ1 OBJ2]. However, note that, although (3b) and (3c) are both Ditransitive
constructions, the contribution of the construction is slightly different for buy and for
give. While (3c) entails actual transfer of possession, (3b) only implies transfer of
possession. Goldberg (1995:31) resolves this problem by proposing that constructions
can be polysemous. That is, a single construction can have two meanings that are
semantically related. Typically, one meaning is a historical extension of the other
meaning.
Within the constructional view, constructions are not derived from another
construction, but can involve a combination of several others, or inherit features from50others. For instance, What did Joe buy? involves the ditransitive construction, the
question construction, the Subject-Auxiliary inversion construction, etc. (Goldberg
2006:10). Importantly, to account for speakers‟ full knowledge of language, a usagebased model is required. Construction grammar aims to account not only for what has
been called the “core” grammar, but also for those apparently idiosyncratic patterns that
other theories have demoted to the periphery. As mentioned above, constructionists do
not endorse the autonomous view of syntax. Reference to SUBJ, OBJ, V, etc. appeal to
a relevant level of description; or, as Croft (2001) puts it, they are “metageneralizations
over construction-specific categories.”
1.6.3. Grammatical relations: an overview
Although most syntactic descriptions have assumed that, in addition to semantic
and pragmatic roles, there are also purely syntactic grammatical relations, we can find
two different ways of understanding them: i) as syntactic primitives; and, ii) as derived
notions. However, what are they derive from is a second point of divergence.
For the theory of Relational Grammar, grammatical relations are theoretical
primitives (Perlmutter 1978, 1980, 1982). Accordingly, Relational Grammar makes the
following universal assumption about the nature of clause structure: “A clause consists
of a network of grammatical relations. Among these relations are „subject of‟, „direct
object of‟, and „indirect object of‟” (Perlmutter & Postal 1986:9), which are named as 1,
2, and 3, respectively. Within this approach, a formal representation of Naomi gave that
book to me, would be (Perlmutter & Postal 1986:12, ex. 22):5155
P c11 c12 c13 c1gaveNaomithat bookmeFollowing this approach, any given language must display grammatical
relations. Further, any language must have clauses that contain one, two, and three
grammatical relations. However, empirical evidence shows that grammatical relations
or at least not all three of them, do not play a central role in every language.
A second way of understanding grammatical relations is as derived notions. For
early Transformational theory (Chomsky 1965), grammatical relations derive from
syntactic phrase structure. As such, subject and object have configurational definitions.
While subject is the NP immediately dominated by S (later called the external
argument), object was the NP immediately dominated by VP (later called the internal
argument). Within this tradition, there was neither a definition nor structural notion of
indirect object. In the figure below, from ([Aspects 1965] Van Valin 2002:244), Kim is
the subject, and the book is the object.
S
NP
NVP
VNPPPARTNKim gave thebook52PNPN
to SandyThe above definitions have the following implications: every language must
have a VP, and the verb and the object must be adjacent. Neither is transparently true
for free word order languages.
A third major conception, the Functional-Typological perspective, claims that
grammatical relations derive from the interaction and grammaticalization of semantic or
pragmatic relations. For Functional Grammar, different choices for subject and object
represent different perspectives or vantage points (Dik 1989). In Cognitive Grammar
(Langacker 1990), subject and object reflect a more general trajector/landmark
asymmetry, which is a linguistic instantiation of the even more general psychological
contrast between figure and ground. Other positions functionally associate subject with
mental starting point (DeLancey 1981, Chafe 1994, Mithun 1999), and subject with
attention (Tomlin 1995, 1997). For Givón (1984, 1995, 2001), subject and object are
grammaticalized pragmatic roles. Givón claims that subject is the “primary topic,”
object is the “secondary topic.” In Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan & Kanerva
1989), the assignment of grammatical relations is based on Lexical Mapping Theory.
Subject and object are constituted by two primitive semantic features (±r: restricted in
terms of semantic roles; ±o: able to complement transitive predicators but not
intransitive predicators). What these approaches have in common is that the assignment
of subject and object is based upon a hierarchy of semantic roles. Among the proposed
hierarchies are Dik‟s (1989) Semantic Function Hierarchy, Givón‟s (1984) Topic
Accession Hierarchy, and Bresnan & Kanerva‟s (1989) Thematic Role Hierarchy. Such
hierarchies are interpreted as determining preferred accessibility to grammatical53relations. For instance, in the Topic Accession Hierarchy (Givón 1984:139), given in
(4), if there is an agent, then the agent is the subject, if not, then dative/benefactive is
the subject, and so on.
(4) Agent >Dative/Benefactive>Patient>Locative >Instrument/Associative>Manner adverbs
One theoretical question, however, remains controversial: are grammatical
relations universal? Some functionalists such as Dixon (1994) and Givón (1997) assume
subject as a universal category, whereas Dryer (1997) and Mithun & Chafe (1999) take
a more skeptical position. DeLancey notes that, “Givon claims that there is a universal
function, while Dryer denies that there is a universal structural category of subject; both
could quite possibly be correct” (2003b:152)
I assume that grammatical relations are neither primitive nor derived from
syntactic phrase structure. Functional-typological theories insist that evidence for
grammatical relations must be based upon language-particular morphosyntactic
properties (Queixalós 1998, 2010). Comrie (1991) points out that “in order to say that a
given grammatical relation exists in a given language this claim must be justified both
language-internally and cross-linguistically”. Based on Keenan‟s (1976) work on the
properties of subjects, the formal features associated with grammatical relations are
divided into two main types: i) coding properties (word order, verb agreement, and case
marking), and ii) behavior & control properties (which define the role of the NP in
given grammatical constructions). Behavior and control properties, as syntactic
phenomena, are sometimes considered more relevant than coding properties and given
prevalence when defining grammatical relations. This is explicit, for example, in Van54Valin (2002:274) who says “grammatical relations exist in a language only where the
behavioral patterns of a language give evidence of a syntactic relation independent of
semantic and pragmatic relations.” Constructions often mentioned to show evidence for
grammatical relations (e.g. passivization, relativization, reflexivization, cross-reference
tracking, possessor raising, purposive constructions, coordinate constructions, etc.) must
be identified language specifically.
However, the amount and kind of evidence needed to argue for the existence of
grammatical relations seems controversial. For instance, for Comrie, “a number of
logically independent criteria must be established that serve to identify the grammatical
relation in question as being syntactically significant in the language in question”
(Comrie 1991:66). However, Van Valin (2002:205) argues that “there are purely
syntactic grammatical relations in a language if there is at least one construction with a
restricted neutralization of semantic and pragmatic relations for syntactic purposes.”
While some authors want a set of multiple criteria, others find one construction is
enough evidence to posit a grammatical relation.
Although there is some controversy around grammatical relations even within
the Functional-Typological approaches, there seems to be a general sense that subject
and (direct) object are the most central relations and display more grammatical
consequences in most languages. In contrast, indirect object occupies an intermediate
status (compared to subject/object and obliques) in terms of number of languages that
have it as a clear category (Givón 2001:108). Cross-linguistic properties associated with
indirect objects may not exist. In consequence, in some languages, the status of indirect55objects is dubious. Usually clause elements that are called indirect objects have the
same formal properties as either direct objects or obliques (Comrie 1991:67-68, T.
Payne 1997:379). This study adds to the literature on languages that show convincing
evidence for subject and object, but not for indirect object, or for a grammatical “second
object” of any kind.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85]"
"66811.1. Information structure
In this document, information structure is understood as the component of
grammar that deals with the study of grammatical patterns driven by pragmatic forces.
As Lambrecht puts it, information structure is concerned with psychological phenomena
such as the speaker‟s hypotheses about the hearer‟s mental states “only inasmuch as
they are reflected in grammatical structure.” (1994:3). It should be pointed out that
information structure differs from (conversational) pragmatics, in that the latter is
concerned with the interpretations of sentences that emerge from conversational
settings. That is to say, “while conversational pragmatics is concerned with the
question of why one and the same sentence form may express two or more meanings,
discourse pragmatics is concerned with the question of why one and the same
[propositional] meaning may be expressed by two or more sentence forms.” (Lambrecht
1994:5). A basic claim of information structure is then that different constructions that
seem to be describing the “same” scene in a single language express different ways of
conceptualizing that scene. That is, different constructions appear to have a different
conceptual content (cf. also Croft 1993).
It has been found that languages exhibit a number of strategies speakers use to
give the hearers instructions about how to integrate incoming information into the
mental representation of the discourse (Chafe 1987, Payne 1993, Mithun 1993). KK is
no exception in that it displays several mechanisms to attract the hearer‟s attention to
the structure of the discourse, including: focal stress, intonation contours, constituent
order, different pronominal forms, specialized morphology, etc. Overall, the grammar669of KK adds to the literature that supports general claims regarding the interrelation
between grammar and discourse.
11.1.1. Assertion and presupposition
For the purposes of this document, it is assumed that two fundamental categories
of information structure are: 1) what is part of the already established common ground
between the speaker and hearer; and, 2) what the speaker wants the hearer to come to
realize by making the utterance. It is said that most, or perhaps all, of communication
relies on the relationship between these two cognitive categories, by relating a new idea
to some kind of background or knowledge (Givón 1995). When a speaker makes a
statement, he makes an assertion. This is a proposition the speaker hopes the addressee
will come to know or be aware of as a result of the sentence. Following Lambrecht
(1994:52), assertion is “the proposition expressed by a sentence which the hearer is
expected to know or believe or take for granted as a result of hearing the sentence
uttered.” On the other hand, the set of assumptions that make up the context necessary
for understanding the utterance is called the presupposition. In Lambrecht‟s words,
presupposition is “the set of propositions lexico-grammatically evoked in an utterance
which the speaker assumes the hearer already knows or believes or is ready to take for
granted at the time of speech” (1994:52).
11.1.2. Focus as a pragmatic notion
For the purposes of this study, we assume Lambrecht‟s fundamental categories
of information structure: presuppositions (the common ground between the speaker and
hearer), and assertions (what the speaker wants the hearer to realize by making the
670utterance). Related to these is the term focus, which is defined in different ways. While
for Dik et al. (1981), focus is the pragmatic function attaching to the most important or
salient information, for Chafe (1976) it is an attention-getting mechanism, and for
Jackendoff (1972:230) it is the information which the speaker assumes or knows the
hearer does not share with him. Lambrecht (1994) defines focus as the semantic element
that is unpredictable or unrecoverable from the context and which makes a proposition
into an assertion. That is, focus is “the semantic component of a pragmatically
structured proposition whereby the assertion differs from the presupposition”
(Lambrecht 1994:213).
Following Lambrecht, by focus construction I understand a semantically
complex construction that results from the superposition of two propositions. For
instance, the semantic structure of a sentence like (1a) consists of a proposition with an
open variable X (1b) and one that instantiates, or re-instantiates the value of X (1c):
(1)a. It‟s the kid who is crying.
b. Someone is crying. (Fx)
c. It‟s the kid. (x = a)
A focus construction thus consists of a presupposed part (1b), information that ispresumed to be already accessible to the addressee, and an asserted part (1c),
information that the speaker assumes is not already shared by the addressee. The
presupposed proposition can be contained within the utterance itself, as in the case of
(1), but it can also be derived from the pragmatic context. For example, (1c) may follow
a crying sound in the surroundings that the speaker assumes to have been noticed by the671addressee. As for the assertive part of focus constructions, in our example the
variable-instantiation (X=kid) is overtly signaled by the cleft construction.
Dik et al. (1981) and Watters (1979) claim the existence of unmarked focus
constructions, i.e., focus neutral; but Lambrecht (1994) argues that no sentence is
pragmatically-neutral, i.e., without information structure. For him, pragmaticallyunmarked constructions are those whose domain of application is larger compared to
pragmatically-marked constructions. That is, given two semantically equivalent but
formally and pragmatically divergent sentences, “one is unmarked if it serves two
discourse functions while the other serves only one of them” (1994:17). Lambrecht then
proposes predicate-focus structure as the universally unmarked type of focus
construction. For instance, a sentence like she likes tea could have predicate focus
because it could be a reply to „tell us about her‟. In this case, „she‟ is the common
ground, and what is the focus of assertion is the predicate, „likes tea.‟ But it could also
be an answer to „does she like coffee or tea?‟, in which case the focus of assertion is just
„tea.‟
In one typology, focus subtypes can be characterized according to two
parameters: pragmatic information (contrastiveness) and scope. In what follows, I
discuss both parameters, and briefly introduce the typologies proposed by Dik et al.
(1981), Lambrecht (1994), and Watters (1979). The table below compares the
distinctions and terminology suggested by these authors.","[697, 698, 699, 700, 701]"
"6In the literature, terms used for similar semantic-pragmatic phenomena include „lest‟ clauses,
apprehensive modality (Dixon 1977, Aikhenvald 2003), timitive mood (Palmer 2001), admonitive mood
(Meira 1999), etc. The syntactic scope for apprehensive modality markers could be independent clauses,
subordinate clauses, and noun phrases. To my knowledge, questions bearing apprehensive epistemic have
not yet been reported in typological works.",[533]
"703An additional use of sentence-focus constructions is not to communicate the
propositional content of the clause but to make explicit that both the speaker and the
hearer have knowledge of the propositions, that they share a common ground. In
contrast to the examples discussed above, here the propositions are entirely
presupposed. Examples that fall in this category include hearer‟s repetitions to confirm
„he got the point‟, speaker‟s conclusive remarks, etc.

§11.1.2, for constructions in which the whole predication is in focus, Watters (1979)
proposes the category polar focus. He argues that in polar focus constructions, it is the
truth value TRUE or FALSE which the speaker asserts or counter-asserts concerning a
proposition. Based on the communicative context, it could be argued that the speaker
uses sentence focus constructions involving =pura to asserts the truth value of the
proposition.","[732, 733]"
"37However, Cabral (1995) questions this affiliation. She compares Kokama with
Tupinamba from the 16th century, and claims that Kokama cannot be genetically
classified because the changes that this language has experienced cannot be explained
following the comparative method, or any other internal reconstruction technique.
Cabral claims that Kokama does not share grammatical characteristics with other
Tupian languages, and it has many elements from other surrounding languages and
families such as Arawakan, Quechuan, Panoan, Spanish and Portuguese. For instance,
while typical Tupian languages are morphologically complex, she claims KokamaKokamilla is isolating. It should be mentioned that her hypotheses are based mostly on
the variety of Kokama spoken in Brazil. As she mentions (pc), her research is based on
data taken from only nine elderly speakers because, by the time of her fieldwork,
Kokama was almost extinct in Brazil. For the Peruvian varieties, she relies on Faust‟s
sparse descriptions of the language.
My own research shows that, in various respects, the varieties spoken in Peru
seem more conservative than the variety described by Cabral. For instance, with respect
to phonology, she argues that in most of Tupi-Guarani languages, allophonic variations
are few, but “not as extremely simplified as in Kokama which has only two phonemes
showing allophonic variation” (1995:56). In contrast, the phonology of KokamaKokamilla spoken in Peru exhibits morphophonological rules and ample distributional
allophonic variation, including neutralization of nasals, sonorization of stops and
affricates, aspiration of stops, fortition of approximants, lenition of affricates, elision of
unstressed vowels, etc. (Vallejos 2005, see also Chapter III). On morphology, Cabral38says that Kokama lacks inflectional morphology. In the varieties of Peru, I have
documented twelve suffixes, although only one could be characterized as inflectional,
three are difficult to classify as either inflectional or derivational, while the others are
clearly derivational (cf. Vallejos 2005). Cabral describes Kokama as lacking
morphological reduplication; in contrast, I found that reduplication of parts of roots is
quite productive in the Kokama-Kokamilla spoken in Peru. Regarding syntax, Cabral
claims that Kokama does not exhibit some word order patterns (i.e., SOV) typical of
Tupí-Guaraní languages; whereas in the varieties of Peru, I find all the Tupí-Guaraní
patterns. (For a summary of the Proto Tupí-Guaraní features in today‟s KK grammar,
please see Table 12.1).
It is obvious that Kokama-Kokamilla is quite divergent from other Tupí-Guaraní
languages spoken in Brazil. Perhaps it can fall into a creole category. However, some of
Cabral‟s arguments for an inability to establish a genetic affiliation between Kokama
and the Tupí-Guaraní family may not hold true for the varieties spoken in Peru. As
pointed out by Michael (pc), many of my observations about Kokama can also be
extended to Omagua, Kokama‟s sister language still spoken by a few speakers in
Loreto, Peru. Preliminary analyses show that Omagua is very similar to the Kokama
spoken in Peru, and rather different from the variety described by Cabral.
This dissertation provides the first in-depth description of Kokama-Kokamilla,
and it is necessary in order to further pursue comparative analysis and historical
reconstruction. Such description will, in turn, permit us to better address questions
regarding genetic classification in this area of the Amazon.","[66, 67, 68]"
"731allowed. Thus, clauses unmarked with respect to tense and aspect pattern with tensemarked clauses, meaning that there is just a two-way constructional split in sets of
allowable orders: progressive-patterns versus non-progressive patterns.
As mentioned above, in KK both syntax and pragmatics play a role in the
distribution of the several order patterns that are available. The syntactic factors have
been discussed in several places, including Chapter VII and VIII. In §11.4.2, I explore
the pragmatic forces behind the distribution of these syntactic configurations, by means
of a frequency study.
11.4.2. A frequency study of constituent order
The database for this study is composed of three traditional stories from three
speakers, comprising a total of 1003 intonation units. Out of this total number of units,
only 682 (68% of the total) were declarative sentences. The remaining units included
questions (4%), imperatives and requests (3%), non-verbal predicates (3%),
subordinated clauses — which appear in the intonation unit following their
corresponding matrix clauses — (7%), and others such as vocatives, false starts,
repeated fragments, etc. (15%). From now on, I will focus on declarative sentences
alone; as such, the total number of units under evaluation (N) is 682. The patterns of
distribution are presented in Table 11.7. While a possible order (and attested elsewhere
in the text database), it should be pointed out that the order OVS was not attested in this
particular set of texts. Figure 11.4 shows these results more visually.","[760, 761]"
"Uncertainty =takaAmong the four markers included in the MOD1 set, =taka is the one that
indicates the least commitment by the speaker to the truth value of his/her utterance.
Every instance with =taka is translated into Spanish with tal vez, quizá „maybe,
perhaps.‟ In previous analyses of the language, the uncertainty marker —cited as taku—
has been described as a suffix used to formulate indirect questions (Faust, 1972:88), or a
particle to form rhetorical questions (Cabral 1995:216). In the database for this study,
neither use was confirmed.
The morpheme =taka is the second most productive modality marker in
discourse (see Table 9.3). In direct opposition to the certainty marker =tin, =taka496introduces an element of doubt to indicate the speaker‟s uncertainty about the truth
value of the statement.

Events marked as uncertain can be also presented as already realized events or
events in the planning. Hence =taka can combine with tense clitics, such as the remote
past tense =tsuri (39a), or the future =utsu (39b). These two examples come from a text
about the relocation of a village. In (39a), the speaker is referring to the fact that during
the rainy season, the annual flooding usually makes the communities collapse, except
for the last two years. In (39b), he is talking about the fact the young Kokamas do not
want to relocate the village, but the elders are ready to do so. It is their hope the
youngsters will follow them.

Up to here we can conclude that MOD1 consists of a coherent set of markers
that indicate the speaker‟s commitment to the truth of the proposition indicated in a
given utterance. This commitment ranges from absolute certainty (=tin) and inferred
certainty (=ray), to distancing from the proposition by marking it as unidentified source
(=ía) or just as a possibility (=taka). The discussion now turns to the second set of
modality markers, which indicate further nuances in the domain of irrealis.
9.1.2.2. Verb phrase modals
MOD2 differs from MOD1 in terms of syntactic distribution and functional
semantics. Beginning with distribution, MOD2 consists of verb phrase clitics; that is
they show up (attached or free) at the right edge of the verb phrase. In contrast to
MOD1, which convey speaker‟s commitment to the truth of the utterance, the MOD2
markers are concerned with the factuality of the event. This set includes the498hypothetical marker (=)mia „HYP‟ and the apprehensive marker (=)era „APPR‟. It
could be argued that the VP unmarked for MOD2 presents events as factual.
Like MOD1, MOD2 markers do not co-occur within a single clause. However, a
crucial point in which MOD2 differs from MOD1 is that they cannot combine with
tense markers. This is demonstrated in (41). Example (41a) shows a clause marked by
the hypothetical, (41b) is marked by tense. However, the clause cannot be marked by
both hypothetical and tense (41c). The opposite order, tense and hypothetical is also
rejected by speakers (41d). However, analyzing tense and MOD2 as one paradigm
would not be appropriate because there is a difference between the two: while MOD2
clitics can occur either bound or unbounded to the VP, tense markers must be attached.

The inability of MOD2 to combine with tense clitics is consistent with the factthat =mia and =era signal events as non-factual, whereas tense clitics (except for =á)
indicate that the event took place or will take place at some point in time, and thus
presume factuality. In the following sections, I discuss each phrasal modal.","[525, 526, 527, 528]"

„We will reach again the people who are crossing (the street)
A first attempt to formulate the structure of these NPs would be: NP = [N=pura
RC=pura]. Notice, however, that each element can also be marked by plural (23b). Also,
there is stress on each pura-marked piece, but there is no pause between them. This
suggests that in constructions like (23) the head and the RC are each behaving as
independent syntactic units on their own. At the same time, they function together as
either the subject or object of the clause. Thus, a better interpretation of the complex
NPs in (23) is that they consist of two NPs in an appositive relationship. That is: NP =
[NP NP]. The appositive NPs have the same referent, which in the communicative
context happens to be in focus. In consequence, the examples in (23) are additional
cases of narrow focus.
With respect to the pragmatic structure of the above examples, constituent order is
crucial for the type of focus being coded. While (22a), (23a) and (23c) display canonical
order SV(O) and yield non-contrastive interpretations, (22b) and (23b) have noncanonical order OSV and bear contrastive interpretations. For instance, sentence (23a)
comes from a narrative about the yacurunas, and is produced when the speaker is700narrating that when she was at her farm, she heard people screaming. She points out that
at the beginning she did not know who was screaming. Then she realized that the ones
screaming were calling „her‟ and happened to be „they‟, her children. Since „they‟ and
„the scared ones‟ have the same referent and this is in focus, the speaker marks both
pieces with =pura. Example (23b) comes from the same narrative about the yacurunas.
Up to this point of the narrative, possible candidates for being called by the yacurunas
introduced by the speaker are her children and her neighbors. Here the speaker asserts
that these aquatic creatures where calling to „her children‟.
(23a‟) Presupposition: <X call>; assertion: <X=they, the scared ones>
(23b‟) Presupposition: <they call X>; assertion: <X=the children who stayed at home>
Set of alternatives: <children, neighbors, someone else>
Up to here we have seen that the scope of =pura is a NP usually in the O
argument function. Depending on the constituent order of the construction, the focus is
modifying what is perceived to be a wrong variable-instantiation, or filling a presumed
gap in the addressee‟s knowledge. Importantly, in KK narrow focus constructions, the
focused element correlates with the prosodic peak within the intonation unit. This
changes in the next section, which examines the different interaction between =pura
and stress used to encode broad focus.
11.2.4. =pura and broad focus
This section examines the contribution of =pura in broad focus constructions.
The construction for focusing the whole predication is a combination of two devices:
the morpheme =pura, and focal stress. In natural discourse, especially in narratives, big
chunks of oral material are produced with no pauses or interruptions. Those situations701call for strategies to mark information packaging. Crosslinguistic evidence indicates
that focal stress tends to be located towards the end of the focus constituent (Halliday
1967, Ladd 1978). Lambrecht (1994:247) specifies that a fundamental principle of
information structure is that “a sentence accent marks the END of a semantic domain,
whose BEGINNING is marked by non-prosodic means.” In contrast to accent, the
presence of particles, or clitics, with distinctive syntax or an especially heavy functional
load has been reported as a prominent feature for signaling information structure of
languages from lowland South America (see Dooley 1990, Derbyshire 1986, Wise
1986, Jensen 1982, among others). Dooley (1990) proposes the term spacer for particles
whose function is to signal divisions in the information structuring of the utterance. In
sentence focus constructions, =pura assumes this delimitative function.
11.2.4.1.=pura as a spacerIn sentence-focus constructions, the NP to which =pura attaches usually
functions as the subject (more likely S than A) of the main clause. In terms of encoding,
the constituent order is unmarked, =pura attaches to the subject NP, and the focal stress
occurs at the end of the verb phrase, usually the verb. The construction could be
summarized as: [S=pura V].
In examples (24-25), the portion under focus is the whole predication.

In the discourse preceding (24), the speaker is talking about illegal fishing, theability of the robbers, the incompetence of the guards, etc. In (24b), she introduces „the
government‟ and comments on it in the subsequent portion of the discourse. Note that
the propositional content of (24b) is not taken for granted or presupposed; that is, the
whole proposition is the focus of assertion. In the same vein, there is not a specific
presupposition for (25a-b). The context is the following: a woman avoids everybody‟s
company while working at the farm, including her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law
suspects the woman is hiding a secret and decides to spy on her. One day she follows
her daughter-in-law and when she arrives to the farm, the only thing she sees is a huge
turtle working. In this context, (25a) and (25b) are answering the question: and what
happens next? Examples like (24b) are often called “presentational sentences” and (25ab) “event-reporting sentences” or “thetic sentences.” The first type introduces a new
entity into the discourse, the second type an event. Both share the fact that the subject of
the sentence is not the topic11 of the discourse.","[729, 730, 731, 732]"

Our aim during our visits to the KK villages was to find as many speakers as we
could, and to record natural speech in as many contexts and genres as possible. While
the collection of primary data was done in the villages, the processing portion was
executed back in Iquitos, the closest city to the KK territory. The main reason for this is
that to process the data we needed to have access to power to use a computer and
specific linguistic software.
As explained above, in the villages I made contact with community members,
leaders and teachers. Rosa Amías and Victor Yuyarima were extremely successful not
only at finding fluent speakers but also at persuading them to talk in their language.
Although the majority of the elders themselves were thrilled to finally have
interlocutors in the language, their relatives usually needed some explanation. So, we
explained in detail the goals of the project as many times as needed.
We recorded texts such as traditional stories, stories from daily life, personal
experiences, spontaneous conversations, songs, etc. Speakers were interviewed
individually, in couples, and in groups. While one-on-one sessions created a stress-free
environment to talk about personal experiences, sessions in groups ensured the language
is used in real communicative situations with a true speaker-hearer relationship to
ensure the most natural communicative speech. Also, since either Victor Yuyarima or
Rosa Amías conducted the interviews, every recording includes at least one highly
fluent speaker. Every speaker knew that if they wanted to stop the recording, they could
do so at any point. Thus, when a speaker would say aynatan „this will do it,‟ we knew77that it was the signal to pause the recording, or just stop it all together. At the end of
each fieldtrip, we went back to Iquitos to process the data.
Mainly because of the age of the fluent speakers, while in the villages we did not
pursue recordings using stimuli to elicit controlled data. However, in the city of Iquitos,
I gathered some video material from Rosa Amías and Victor Yuyarima, with focus on
the lexicon and grammar associated with space. For this task, I selected a set of pictures
with different elements in them. I explained them that one speaker will describe a scene
while the other tries to reproduce it on a separate sheet of paper; next they would
compare the original picture and the drawing, and discuss the results. They found it
interesting at first, but very soon they thought it was a childish task and suggested
moving on to document “more serious” aspects of the Kokama life.
Although for the analyses of this dissertation preference is given to textual
material, some elicited data was collected when looking for answers to specific
phenomena previously identified in spontaneous speech. Most of the elicited discussed
in this dissertation was gathered during the transcription and translation of texts. In
addition to elicitation grounded in the need to understand the transcribed texts, I also
gathered elicited data through direct interviews, asking native speakers to complete
paradigms and translate sentences given in Spanish. Most of the material collected
following this strategy was reviewed with a second consultant. Also, on a few
occasions, I was able to work with both Victor Yuyarima and Rosa Amías at the same
time. During these sessions, both consultants were presented with the same data at the
same time looking for their reactions, interaction, and discussion about the patterns in78question. This maximized the reliability of speakers‟ judgments about the acceptability
of specific constructions.","[105, 106, 107, 108]"

„Ripened banana he finds there‟raepeOSVAs indicated earlier, the findings presented in Table 11.7 reveal that
progressive-marked constructions (VS & SOV) are the least productive of all (3% in the
database). It needs to be pointed out that the results of the frequency study are
categorical with respect to non-progressive constructions; however, these numbers tell
nothing about the productivity of tense-marked clauses alone. Recall that nonprogressive constructions include both tense-marked clauses and clauses that are
unmarked for tense and aspect. Thus, considering that progressive marked are
extremely rare in discourse, I wondered how productive tense-marked constructions
actually are, compared to progressive-marked clauses and clauses that are unmarked for
tense and aspect. This question is addressed in the last section of this chapter, §11.5.
11.4.3. Conclusions of this section
First, the language has several constituent order patterns; however, their
distribution in natural discourse is extremely skewed. The unmarked focus structure
typically displays the SV(O) order. In this configuration, the S argument is highly
topical, hence generally expressed by pronouns. Constituent order plays a significant
role in expressing pragmatic factors: sentence initial position is the privileged position.",[765]
"FUNCTIONPostposedPurposePostposedPurposePre- &
postposedPurpose
(no implication on
the factuality of
the event?)As discussed above, while the distribution of -tara and -mira can be accounted
for on grammatical grounds, tsen-clauses cannot. More specifically, speakers have two
choices when they want to indicate purpose by means of adverbial clauses: -tara/mira
clauses (whose distribution depends on the missing argument in the adverbial clause),
and -tsen clauses. However, what triggers the speaker‟s choice seems to be too subtle to
have been adequately captured at this point in the analysis.
A preliminary explanation I propose here is that the choice is driven by
pragmatics. This claim is based on speakers‟ observations about examples like the one
in (86), which was taken from a personal narrative:630(86)yantsui doctor
there
doctoryumunu

penu
uka-ka]
come.back-PUR3
1PL.EX.F
house=LOC
„Then the doctor sent us/let us free to go back to our house‟
Given that the purpose clause contains an intransitive verb, hence an S
argument, I asked two speakers if the tsen-clause in (86) could be replaced by a
tara-clause. That is, I offered the apparently parallel sentence in (87):
(87)yantsui doctor
yumunu
penu=tsuri
there doctor
send
1PL.EX.F=PAS3
„Then the doctor sent us to go back‟[iriwa-tara]
come.back-PUR1The two speakers agreed that, while (87) is good, in the context of the narrative
-tsen is the approppriate construction. One speaker explained it this way: “With -tsen it
means that the doctor told us we were free to go, and so we go back by ourselves, by
our own means. With -tara it would mean that they not only told us what to do, but also
that perhaps they provided us with a boat to travel.”
For me, this means that in tsen-clauses the purpose event is more independent
from the main event, as opposed to in -tara/mira clauses. That is, the event indicated in
the adverbial clause is not only presented as unrealized but also implies that the subject
of the adverbial clause has more control/volition as to whether to execute the purpose
clause or not. This nicely correlates with the fact that -tsen clauses are syntacticaly less
integrated than -tara/mira clauses. For instance, they do not share arguments, and nocoreferentiality has to exist. Further, tsen-clauses are more finite: they have their
complete array of arguments, the word order is SVO, and the verbs marked by -tsen can631take other morphology such as the reiterative. However, while this explanation can
account for an important number of instances, it is clearly not sufficient.
Another parameter I explored is collocational restrictions. A quick examination
of the database reveals that the three purpose constructions apparently do not exhibit
collocational restrictions, at least with reference to the verbs on which they occur. I
found a number of verbs that appear marked by all three subordinators (in different
utterances, that is). For instance, consider the examples in (88), showing all three
possibilities with verb aya „shoot‟; in (89), all three are with the verb yauki „make‟; and
in (90), all three with erutsu „bring, carry‟. The example in (90b) is repeated from
(79c); the relevant portions are in bold.

unanswered questions. For instance, in (90a), why is -tara better than -tsen given that
two -tsen clauses in sequence are possible (as shown in (83))? Along the same lines,
why, in (90b), is -mira better than -tsen, and in (90c) -tsen better than -mira, where in
both examples, the syntactic conditions to use either of them are met? These questions
are left to be addressed in future research.
10.4.2 . Cause/reason clauses: -ikua
Cause/reason clauses in KK are formed by attaching the form -íkua to the last
word of the subordinated clause.7 In terms of semantics, these clauses indicate the
cause or reason for the event indicated in the matrix clause. Causal clauses can be
thought of as the motivating events for the event indicated in the matrix clause. In short,
[Clause]-ikua can be translated into English as „because of X‟. In (91a), the adverbial
clause „because they speak only with mestizos‟ is presented as the cause or explanation
for the event expressed in the matrix clause „they forget it (the Kokama language)‟.
Along the same lines, in (91b), „because I saw no one‟ is offered as the reason, or the
motivating factor for why „I entered in your house‟.

"4458.2.1.2. Negation in existential constructions
There are two ways to make negative existential predicates. The first
construction utilizes the particle tɨma, which is placed in front of emete to negate the
whole construction. As a result we have the construction: [NEG emete NP] whose
propositional meaning is „X does not exist‟. This is presented in examples (36a, b).
Note that in (36c), introduced in (34c), the existential construction is embedded, so
emete occurs at the end of the construction, [NEG NP emete].

correlation has been observed between temende and variables such as colloquial and
fast speech. Speakers do not seem to have any intuitions about the distribution of tɨma
emete versus temente. In general, my consultants have no problem replacing one for the
other in any utterance.

The second type of negative existential includes the particle ni, which is placed
right in front of the noun phrase whose non-existence is being predicated. The
existential emete comes at the end. The resulting construction is: [ni NP emete] whose
propositional meaning is: „No X exists.‟ That is, the scope of ni is the noun phrase
rather than the whole construction. The examples are given in (38). It should be noted
that no example where emete precedes the negated NP has been attested [*emete ni NP].

suspected that he might have been eaten by a tiger. In (38c), repeated from (33a), the
speaker is talking about a type of fish that it is now almost extinct. The embedded447clause in example (38d), repeated from (34b), asserts that „no person‟ was around at the
time the event expressed in the main predicate happened.
Finally, the examples in (39) exhibit the combination of negation and tense.
Only the first pattern of negation — the one that includes tɨma— has been attested in
combination with tense clitics within a single utterance. To express both negation and
tense, the negative particle comes in the first position followed by emete, and then
comes the noun phrase to which the tense clitic is attached. Schematically: [NEG emete

8.2.1.3. Modals in existential constructions
Modal clitics attach to the first element in the clause, whether this is emete, or
the negative particle in negative existential constructions. Examples are given in (40ad).

yankata=ura=uy

daughter.lawemete=uy ya
ku=kuara
exist=PAS1 3SG.F farm=INE
„It appears it was not, it was not our daughter in law which was at her farm‟
In (40a) the uncertainty marker =taka cliticizes to emete. In (40b), the
apprehensive marker =era appears attached to emete and the whole construction gets
interpreted as questioning the potentiality of the event, „how could this be the case?‟
Example (40c) gives a negative existential construction in which the speculative modal
=ray attached to the negative particle tɨma. The particle -tsunka, in (40d), has not been
introduced yet. This is a discourse level morpheme that expresses the speaker‟s surprise
when an unexpected or unusual situation happens; it is against his expectations and he
resists believing it. In Amazonian Spanish it is usually translated with the expression ya
vuelta, which bears counter-expectation, surprise, and disbelief. This resembles what
DeLancey (2002) calls mirativity. For a full description of modality markers, see §9.1.3.
Finally, both pieces of the existential construction can be questioned
independently: example (41a) questions the “thing” whose existence is under
discussion, and (41b) questions the predicate „exist‟.
(41)a. ay senior, mari-tipa emete ajan ku=kuara

(Lit. Does your shovel exist?‟)
8.2.2. Existential constructions with possessive interpretation
In KK, possession can be inferred from several constructions. That is, the
relationship of possession is not created by the construction itself. As shown in §8.2,
some existential constructions are interpreted as possessive predicates. In the following
subsections I discuss the existential constructions that speakers primarily associate with
possession when asked to provide examples with possessive relationships.
8.2.2.1. [emete [POSSESOR POSSESSED]NP]
In this construction, the noun phrase whose existence is under discussion
consists of both a possessor and possessed element: [emete [POSSESOR
POSSESSED]NP]. Recall from §5.9 that in KK a genitive relationship inside a NP is
expressed by word order. In constructions with emete, the possessor is interpreted as the
subject, and the possessed as the object. The examples in (42) give this pattern; the
possessor is in bold.
(42)a. emete
tsa
mɨmɨrakunia=nu
ay
ikua yauki-tara=nu
exist
1SG.F daugther=PL.F
3SG.F know make-REL.A=PL.F
„I have daughters who know how to make it‟ (fan)
(Lit. There are my daughters who know how to make it)
b. emete
y=irua

SG.F=mate

(Lit. His partner exists)450c. ikia=ka

(Lit. My partner is in this village)
d. emete=taka na
ɨkɨ
exist=UNC 2SG chili
„You might have chili‟
(Lit. Maybe there is your chili)
Examples in (43) include noun phrases with two layers of genitive relationships.
For instance, in (43a), tsa mena „my husband‟ is the possessor of „money,‟ and tsa „I‟ is
the possessor of „husband.‟ In (43b) we see a comparable situation: „pain‟
metaphorically belongs to „my head‟, but at the same time tsa „I‟ is the possessor of
„head.‟ The elements interpreted as the subject of the possessive verb in the translation
are in bold.
(43)a. temente[[tsa ] mena=pura ]kurikiNEG.exist 1SG.F husband=FOCmoney‘My husband doesn’t have money’(Lit. My husband’s money doesn’t exist)
c. emete
[ [tsa] yakɨ ] tsachi-n
exist
1SG.F head feel.pain-NZR
„I have headache‟ (Lit. There is my head‟s pain)
8.2.2.2. [LOC emete NP]
The second existential construction that gets interpreted as expressing
possessive information is one where location is explicitly expressed. This is the451so-called mihi est construction, in which the possessor is interpreted from a locative
where some entity is supposed to exist: [LOC emete NP], as in (44a-b).
(44)a. ta
yuwama=ka
emete era-n

(Lit. There is good yucca beer at my daughter in law)
b. juria=ka emete aruts
Julia=LOC exist rice
„Julia has rice‟
(Lit. There is rice at Julia) (ED)
However, the possessive interpretation becomes available only when thelocation makes reference to an animate being who could be a potential possessor (44,
45a). Note that when a clause does not include a locative phrase (45b), or it does not
refers to an animate entity (45c), the possessive reading is not available.

c. ikia-ka
emete eyu-n,
this=LOC exist eat-NZR
„Here there is food, mom‟mama
mother8.2.2.3. [NPi, emete POSSESSORi POSSESSED]
The existential construction [emete POSSESOR POSSESED] can be further
modified to highlight a pragmatically marked possessor. In this case, a left-dislocated
noun phrase is added to the front of the construction which is coreferent with the452POSSESSOR. Interestingly, this is one of the first patterns speakers provide when asked
to translate Spanish possessive constructions; in my text corpus, however, this pattern is
rather rare.
The examples in (46) are from texts, the one in (47) was elicited. In the
examples (46a-b) and (47a), note that the predicate phrase includes a possessor pronoun
which is coreferent with the noun phrase which precedes emete.

temente
rai
yawiri
Julia
NEG.exist
3SG.M
yucca
„Julia does not have yucca‟
(Lit. „Julia, her yucca does not exist‟) (ED)
In the left-dislocated existential construction, a pause can be optionally addedafter the first NP. My consultants provided also some clues that point towards sentences
which are not about the possessive relationship, but about the entities being portrayed as
possessors. For instance, (48a) would be describing Julia in terms of what she
possesses.
(48)a. juriai […] temente
rai
yawiri
Julia
NEG.exist
3SG.M
yucca
„Julia does not have yucca‟
(Lit., As for Julia, her yucca doesn‟t exist) (ED)453b. urii […]
emete rai
rinupi=kɨra r=atura=kuara
3SG.M.L exist 3SG.M
lemon=DIM 3SG.M=packet=INE
„He has his lemon in his packet‟
(As for him, there is his lemon in his pocket) (ED)
In sum, I would argue that, although the left-dislocated existential construction
illustrated in (46) to (48) is interpreted as possessive, its primary function is less to
express a possessive relationship and more to predicate some facts about a
pragmatically marked entity within the discourse context.
8.2.2.4. [NP emete NP-yara]
This patter was found only in elicitation. It includes both emete and -yara. Here,
-yara functions as specifier of the noun it is attached to and it is interpreted as
„own/owner‟.
(49)a. mijiri
emete

mena
emete
wapuru-yara
1SG.F
husband
exist
ship-own
„My husband has his own ship‟
(Lit. My husbandi, there is a ship-owneri‟)
If one wants to add tense to this construction, the tense clitics go after the NPmarked by -yara. This is further evidence that -yara is part of the predicate NP.
(50)a. mijiri
emete uka-yara=tsuriay

„My husband had his own ship‟ (Lit. My husband, there was a ship-owner‟)454Although this pattern, [NP emete NP-yara], was not found in my corpus, it was
confirmed by two other speakers. They have no problem understanding it, even though
they do not produce it spontaneously.
8.3.","[474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484]"
"736Thus, the pattern OSV is the result of focalizing O when it encodes pragmatically
salient information. These results are consistent with what has been found in other areas
of the grammar, such as focus constructions.
Another finding of the frequency study is that the progressive-marked patterns
— VS and SOV — are extremely rare in spontaneous speech. In the next section we
turn the discussion to those patterns, and explore the function of progressive-marked
constructions by contrasting them with tense-marked constructions.
11.5. The function of tense/aspect marked clauses in discourse
In several places in this dissertation, I have stated that there is a relationship
between tense, aspect, and constituent order (see§11.4.1). In section, §11.4, the
productivity of the various ordering patterns available in the language was examined.
One of the findings is that progressive-marked patterns appear very rarely (about 3% of
declarative sentences). However, because tense-marked clauses pattern like unmarked
clauses, those results tell nothing about the productivity of tense-marked clauses.
So, two questions arise: i) How often do speakers employ tense-marked clauses,
progressive-marked clauses, and unmarked clauses? ii) What drives the distribution of
tense-marked clauses and progressive-marked clauses? This section addresses those
questions by exploring whether or not all, of any of those patterns can be associated
with particular discourse functions.
11.5.1. Background and foreground in discourse
A crucial finding regarding the structure of the discourse is that languages codify in
different ways the main events of a story, i.e., foreground information, as opposed to737supportive material, i.e., background information (Hopper 1979). Empirical studies
have shown that this observation is especially relevant for the study of narratives; that
is, those types of discourses that are basically monologues. Some of the defining
features of these two types of information are summarized in Table 11.8.
Table 11.8: Background vs. foreground (Hopper 1979, Longacre 1996)
ForegroundBackground refers to dynamic and active events,
punctual verbs often in perfective aspect
 high level of assertion durative, stative, iterative verbs, often in
imperfective aspect
 low level of assertion (modals) events happen in sequences, contingent on
the completion of prior events does not happen in sequences, may be
located at any point along the time axis, or
not located at all
 add supportive material, complementary
information, comment on main events constitutes the main storyline
 new material in the storyline is introduced
in the predicate (verb plus complement) likelihood of topic changes, introduction of
new information in the subject positionHopper suggests that the foreground/background distinction is a universal of
narrative discourse (1979:213), and it is encoded by means of several strategies. A
number of studies seem to confirm this hypothesis. For instance, some of the attested
strategies are voice (Malay), word order (old English), and tense/aspect (Swahili,
French), among others.
Although the foreground/background distinction is valid in at least narrative, it
is perhaps somehow too general. For instance, some studies have found that within the
foreground category, languages may make a distinction between unexpected/crucial
events and routine/predictable events; others distinguish the events that constitute the
climax from the ones that do not. In Yagua, for instance, there are two types of
foreground: ordinary main event line versus peak (Payne 1992). In Godie there are three738types of foreground information: crucial events, sequential events, and concluded events
(Marchese 1988). That is, languages have multiple ways of organizing even the
foreground half of discourse.
Further, even though the relevance of the foreground/background distinction in
narratives seems undeniable, it is not clear that this distinction is applicable to other
types of discourse, especially those that involve more than one speaker, such as
spontaneous conversations. As Longacre (1996) points out, before this type of analysis
is extended to other types of discourse it is perhaps necessary to set up some parameters
to classify them into different genres; this may make it possible to have comparable
results.17
In §11.5.2, we evaluate the significance of the foreground/background distinction
to explain the distribution of progressive-marked clauses and tense-marked clauses in
KK discourse.
11.5.2. Data and findings
This particular discourse study examines twenty-one short texts (2546
intonational units in total), collected from eleven speakers. The variables considered in
the selection of the sample were the following:
Gender of the speaker: This variable is relevant for KK since the language
displays several distinctions according to the speaker‟s gender. The texts come
from four women and five men.","[765, 766, 767, 768]"

Given that the recipient is coded as the object in Configuration III, [SUBJA V

The second finding is that even though it need not be explicit, in the majority ofthe sentences with the verb yumi „give‟ there is an understood recipient or beneficiary.
Applying Croft‟s categories, it is possible to say that in a number of tokens it has a
definite interpretation. The question then is where the definite interpretation comes
from. Because of this discovery, each of the 38 give scenarios was further examined. It
was found that the R can be inferred from other pieces of the sentences, such as: i) as
the possessor of the object; ii) as an argument of a relative clause modifying the object;
and, iii) as an argument of an adverbial clause. The results are summarized in Table 9.8,
followed by examples that illustrate each category.","[553, 554]"
