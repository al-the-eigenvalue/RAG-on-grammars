in (655), are often pragmatically used for suggestion or invitation (‘Won’t you/
they …?’ = ‘I suggest you/they ….’; see also example (609) above):
(654)Tãů tá kū-chi ́bü?̀

̊ (or its variant tãu
̊ ʼü̃́) ‘neg’ in its pro-sentential function (see Section 7.6
Tãu
above) is regularly used pragmatically as a way to answer a content question in a
deliberately vague way, out of self-effacement (in which case tãů is often followed
by a more precise answer) or in order to elude a question (‘Well, nothing special,
(it’s just that …)’), as in the following example (repeated from (450)):312

This pragmatic use of tãů ‘neg’ is likely related to the fact that tãů probably comes from tåʼúʼü̃́
(‘nothing’, among other possible glosses) etymologically (see Section 7.2.1 above).

‘“What are you looking for?” [she] asked. “Well, nothing special, I’ve shot
a beautiful tére̋ parrot, it has fallen down here but I can’t find it.”’ [jsg
B220–222]
Rhetorical questions are often used to convey an emphatic negative exclamative meaning. In this discursive strategy, the referent asked about is implicitly
meant not to exist, or in other words an interrogative word is used instead of its
corresponding negative existential indefinite (as in e.g. ‘What did he do…?’ =
‘He did (absolutely) nothing!’). This is illustrated in examples (657–658) (see also
(T56)). Compare (657) with (622) for a parallel utterance featuring the corresponding explicitly negative construction. In (658), the corresponding negative sentence
is uttered immediately after the rhetorical question, yielding a binary discursive
structure interrogative.sentence+negative.sentence of relatively common
use in the language:

Interlinearized text: episodes from
the myth of Ngutapa as told by Loida
Ángel Ruiz
This appendix provides a fully interlinearized transcription of about two thirds of
a recording of the first few episodes of the mythological cycle of Ngutapa and
his children as told by Loida Ángel Ruiz (lar, ♀, 49 y.o.). The corresponding
recording (recording C by lar in Table 1) was made on November 5, 2016 in
lar’s house in sma. This recording is 35’17” long altogether, of which the first
21’55” are transcribed in what follows. This entirely monological text is generally
representative of traditional Tikuna mythological storytelling. Note, however, that
I was the only hearer present during most of the performance, which is a highly
unusual speech setting for this kind of Tikuna verbal art.
The cycle of Ngutapa, his two sons Yoi (often called /tă-nátǖ/ (4-father) “our
father” by the Tikunas) and Ipi, and his two daughters is by all accounts (whether
endogenous or exogenous) the most important one in today’s Tikuna mythological repertoire, minimally among the Tikunas of Colombia. It contains, among
many other mythological accounts of elements characteristic of today’s world, an
account of the creation of human beings. For versions of the cycle of Ngutapa in
Western languages, see in particular Nimuendajú (1952:121–137; partly condensed
English version) and Goulard & Montes (2016; extensive Tikuna-Spanish version).
For a discussion of linguistic features typical of Tikuna mythological discourse, see
Gómez-Pulgarín (2012).
For parallel—although often divergent—versions of the episodes transcribed
below, see more specifically Nimuendajú (1952:121–123, 133–134) and Goulard
545& Montes (2016, episodes I–III). Note, importantly, that lar, the speaker of the
recording transcribed below, was part of the transcription and translation committee for Goulard & Montes (2016), which mostly consists in a written version of a
recording of the cycle of Ngutapa told in 1985 and 1988 by Humberto Chetanükü,
a renowned Tikuna storyteller from the upper Loretoyacu river. lar’s version of
the episodes below is therefore heavily influenced by Chetanükü’s version reported
in Goulard & Montes (2016).
An English summary of the episodes transcribed in this appendix is given first in
Section A.1. The fully interlinearized transcription of these episodes is provided
in Section A.2.

"7.6Pro-sentential negationThere is no morpheme specialized in pro-sentential negation in smat. Negative
pro-sentences result from the mere ellipsis of any other constituent than the
negative word from what their equivalent full negative clause would be (although
that negative word’s clitics and/or mārǖ ‘prf’ often remain, if present, as in the
first half of example (644)). Thus, (644) can be interpreted as being based on a full
̊ ʼǘ̃=mā=nü̂wa̋/ [/maloca-wa̋ tā=måʼ-ē-gǘ gá nůʼkǘmá./] ‘[We]
clause such as /Tãu
didn’t [live in a maloca in the old days.].’, and (645) can be interpreted as being
based on a full clause such as Tãů ʼü̃́ [/chā=/ti ́mido.] ‘[I’m] not [tímido.]’. Example
(646) starts with the realization of a full clause, and then proceeds to “repeating”
that same clause by means of tågù ‘never’ used as a pro-sentential negation marker.

However, where a specialized negative word (e.g. tåʼu ‘be absent’, /g̃e-̊ / ‘not
have’, tåʼúgù ‘never’, etc.) would be regularly expected in a full negative clause,
̊ ‘neg’ (or its variant tãu
̊ ʼü̃́) can work as a universal pro-sentential negation
tãu
marker, much like English ‘no!’. Thus, in example (647) (repeated from (635)
above, although with a more literal translation), while in fact privative negation
is involved (which could have triggered the use of the specialized privative verb
/g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ in the pro-sentential part of the speaker’s answer), the less specific
negation marker tãů ‘neg’ is used instead of /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ (here under its irregular
̊ =mā/ ‘neg-precisely’; see Section 7.5 above):
combinatorial variant tåmā, for /tãu
(647)Tåmā, chā-g̃eʼ̊ ma̰ tàã.̄

Note that when the remaining negative word is tãů ‘neg’, it may indeed be re̊ ʼü̃́
alized as tãů , but it also frequently occurs under its conservative variant tãu
(while this variant is marginal in full clauses; see Section 7.2.1 above), as in examples (644–645). By contrast, it does not seem to be able to occur under its innovative
denasalized variant tåu. This phonological conservatism of the pro-sentential use
5377. Negation
of tãů ‘neg’, as compared to its ordinary clausal use, is likely due to the fact that tãů
‘neg’ is normally left unstressed in the latter use, while it obligatorily bears stress
in the former.
In answers to interro-negative questions (e.g. ‘Don’t you like it?’), pro-sentential negation is pragmatically used for confirmation by the speaker of the assumption of the addressee (‘No, [I don’t like it indeed.]’), as shown in the following example:
(648)[Tãů tàã̄ k[i ̄]-pà?]—Tãů ʼü!̃́
tãů =tàã̄̊ ʼü̃́
tãuk[i ̄]=pàneg=itself 2sg.sbj.pci ̄=be.tired neg‘[(Denis Bertet:) Aren’t you tired yet?]—No [I’m not]!’ [jsg A403]7.7Negative imperativeNegation cannot co-occur with a predicative phrase in the Imperative Inflectional Type (on which see Section 5.4). The negative imperative construction used
to express prohibitives, whether with a singular or a plural second person subject,
seems to be based on the negation focus construction described in Section 7.5
above (focalized.negative.word (inflected.copula) (lk=)clause.in.sbjvsub). By contrast to the negation focus construction, however, the prohibitive construction does not seem to ever involve the use of the inflected copula, and it often—
although not obligatorily—includes an additional specialized prohibitive second
position enclitic /=tā/ ‘proh’ (focalized.negative.word=proh (lk=)
clause.in.sbjv-sub).309 My corpus and elicitation notes only contain cases of prohibitives involving the negative word tãů ‘neg’, such as the following:
(649)Tãů (tā) (i ̀) “nôʼe̋” ña̋kùʼü̃́ tüʼ̂ ü!̃̄
̊ (=tā)
tãu(i ̀=)nôʼe̋ña̋-kù-ʼü̃́tü-̂ ʼü̃̄neg=proh lk.ns=old.woman do.thus-2sg.sbj\sbjv-sub 3s-acc‘Don’t call her “grandma”!’ [ear elic.]
(650)Tãů tā ì pē-chókùgüʼ̋ ü!̃́According to ear, using the (optional) linker in the prohibitive construction imparts extra
directive strength to the prohibition and may make it sound more threatening.

However, it is possible that the prohibitive construction may also take existential
negative indefinites (see Section 7.3 above) in its position for focalized negative
words (with meanings such as ‘Don’t touch anything!’ or ‘Never tell them about
it!’).3107.8Negation and coordinationNegative polarity and coordination do not display any specific interaction.
Negation and coordination in the expression of groups such as ‘X and not Y’, ‘not
X and Y’, or ‘not X and not/nor Y’ (with X and Y being either arguments or whole
clauses) are thus encoded separately by their ordinary dedicated markers. The
following example illustrates the coordination of two negative clauses (of the type
‘not X and not/nor Y’), which is ordinarily done by means of the general coordination marker rǜ ‘and’:

"The use of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in polar questions is illustrated in the following example:(486)Kűnà-mêʼü?̃́kű=nà=mê-ʼü̃́2sg.ben=3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=be.good\sbjv-sub4215. Inflection of the predicative phrase

Examples (487) and (488) illustrate the use of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in utterances involving
deontic modality, with a first person subject and a fourth person subject respectively (see (477) and (467) above for instances of deontic sbjv-ʼü̃́ involving a second
person subject and a third person subject, respectively). Note that deontic sbjv-ʼü̃́
can occur in both declarative utterances (as in (488)) and interrogative utterances
(as in (487)).

(ii) Uses in dependent clauses. Apart from main clauses, sbjv-ʼü̃́ is found in
two major kinds of dependent clauses:
– it is obligatory in adverbial clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ (‘it being the case
that …’), /…-ʼka̰/ ‘cause’ (‘in order to …’), and ēka̰/ka̰ … ‘so that …’ (or
‘while …’);
– it is obligatory in complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’.
4225.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
The frequent and semantically vague adverbial clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ …
‘conj’ are roughly comparable to English gerundive clauses, hence the possibility of generally glossing them as ‘it being the case that …’. They may take a wide
array of circumstantial meanings and are often ambiguous. Their exact interpretation relies heavily on the linguistic and extra-linguistic context. Common possible
translations of these adverbial clauses in English include ‘when …, once …, while
…, as …, because …, although …’. These clauses may also occasionally bear no
clear semantic or discursive relation to their context (as in e.g. (T155)). The use
of the conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ to introduce them is not optional. The following two examples illustrate this type of adverbial clauses featuring predicative
phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́:
(489)Wâʼí náʼa consorciowa̋ chà-pūrāküʼ̋ ü̃́ rǜ mārǖ i ̋chā-ṹʼü̃̀ náwa̋.

Purpose adverbial clauses (‘in order to …’) involve a predicative phrase in
sbjv-ʼü̃́ to which the relational noun /-ʼka̰/ ‘cause’ is attached. This is shown in
example (491). These clauses are often—but not obligatorily—introduced by the
̃́
conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’. Note that in rare occasions, clauses in sbjv-ʼü-ka̰
may be used to express reason (‘because …’) rather than purpose.

̃́
Among younger speakers (e.g. jsg, igv), such clauses in sbjv-ʼü-ka̰
are also
frequently used as mere complement clauses of predicates involving volitive
modality (i.e. predicates with meanings such as ‘to want to …’, ‘to invite to …’, ‘to
tell to …’, ‘to ask to …’, etc.), as shown in example (492).

̃́
In this context, however, clauses in sbjv-ʼü-ka̰
seem to be an emerging and still
rarer alternative for the regular complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ discussed
further in this section (or, in specific cases, for the command complement clauses
in rǜ … ‘and’, on which see Section 5.2.5 above).
Sbjv-ʼü̃́ is also of systematic use in the semantically vague adverbial clauses
in ēka̰/ka̰ … ‘so that …, while …’, as illustrated in the following example:
(493)̃́
“Pà mā, pà mā, kū-tṵ̈kǘ ka̰ kūī-déʼàèchāʼü?”

due to which you’re constantly talking?’]?”’ [igs 46–48]
Regular complement clauses consist in a clause that is introduced by the conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ and includes a predicative phrase in sbjv-ʼü̃́ (on rare
4245.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
complement clauses including a predicative phrase in bare sbjv, see Section 5.2.5;
on complement clauses of volitive predicates optionally marked with the relational
noun /-ʼka̰/ ‘caus’, see above in the present section). Such complement clauses
may function syntactically as either subjects (as in example (494)), (core) objects,
or any non-core participant required by the valency of the predicative phrase (as
in (495)).

The exact syntactic role of regular complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ is
sometimes unclear, as in (496), where a complement clause functions as a syntactically indeterminate complement of the intransitive phasal verb ũĉ hi ̀gǜ ‘continue’

Regular complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ may also be topicalized and thus
occur in extra-syntactic position. In this specific case, the conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ …
‘conj’ is frequently dropped, as in the following example:

As shown in examples (494–496), complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’
that are syntactically integrated in a matrix clause regularly follow the predicative
phrase of that matrix clause. Most of the time, an expletive cataphoric third
person non-salientive pronominal form (whether a free pronominal form, or
an index occurring within the predicative phrase as in (494–495)) precedes, or
is included in, the predicative phrase of the matrix clause and fills the syntactic
position of the complement clause (compare English ‘it is true that …’, ‘it is hard
to ...’).
Complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ may complement an extremely diverse range of predicative phrases involving notions such as utterance (‘say that …,
ask what …, etc.’), cognition (‘know that …, think that …, etc.’), perception (‘see
that …, hear that …, etc.’), emotion (‘be afraid to …, enjoy doing, etc.’), volitive
modality (‘want to …, order to …, etc.’), or phasal aspect (‘continue to …, finish
doing, etc.’), among others.
(iii) Uses not related to clause type. Clauses in sbjv-ʼü̃́ are involved as
components of the cleft sentences that constitute the strategy used for focalizing
constituents other than subject and (core) object arguments (on the strategy applied for focalizing subject and (core) object arguments, see Section 5.2.5 above).
Constituents with any syntactic function (e.g. comitative in example (498), punctual locative in (499), manner in (491) above) and of any syntactic complexity
(whether a simplex or complex NP as in (498–499) or a full dependent clause as in
(500), repeated from (426 above)) may be focalized via this strategy.

This focalization strategy, apart from its regular and expected use for information structure management, is involved in a non-optional, essentially grammaticalized way in the second person prohibitive construction, which probably comes
historically from a focalization construction exerting focus on the negative particle
tãů ‘neg’. This construction is illustrated in the following example:

shown in (498–500) above. On the second person prohibitive construction, see
Section 7.7.
As was mentioned at the end of Section 5.2.5 above, the focalization of interrogative constituents in any syntactic function is optional but frequent in content
interrogative utterances, as shown in example (502) (see also (485) above). In
practice, interrogative utterances featuring such focalization of the interrogative
constituent do not seem to contrast in any significant way from corresponding utterances that do not feature focalization, as in (459) above.

[jsg C46–47]3.5.2.6Linker used as a type of definite determinerAnother case where the linker’s function is not to link the nominal constituent to
which it is procliticized to any preceding coreferential nominal constituent or index
is when it serves as a particular type of definite determiner used to signal that a
nominal constituent is intended to allow for the identification of a particular
referent within a set of referents already established as a main topic (implying
a contrast between that particular referent and the other referents in the set of
referents in question). This function of the linker is extremely reminiscent of the
use of the non-locative endophorics as a type of definite determiners (on which see
Section 3.4.3, p.225). In this function, the linker often marks a headless relative
clause, as in (254–255), or minimally a NP modified by a relative clause. It may
also mark a NP that does not contain any relative clause, as in (256).

tentatively analyze as the linker in its past non-salientive inflectional form.
This morpheme is procliticized to apparently any type of subordinate clauses
to indicate that they refer to past processes. Example (257) shows this morpheme /gá=/ procliticized to a circumstantial adverbial clause in /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’.
Examples (258–259) show it procliticized to complement clauses introduced by the
conjunction náʼa ∼ ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ (náʼa and ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ are two subdialectal variants of the same
conjunction; note that intriguingly, although these two variants generally have the2683.5. Linker
exact same distribution, they do not occur in the same order relative to the morpheme /gá=/ under discussion in this section, yielding /gá=náʼa .../ but /ni ́i ̀.i ̃̊

Importantly, the non-past non-salientive inflectional form of the linker
(/i ̀=/) never occurs in front of subordinate clauses that do not refer to past
processes (or, minimally, that are not explicitly marked as referring to past processes).225 Such subordinate clauses, regardless of whether they are coreferential
Except in cases where a subordinate clause in /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’ occurs in a cleft construction serving
for focalization, as in example (242) above. In this specific case, the subordinate clause does indeed
bear the form /i ̀=/ ‘lk.ns’ of the linker if the main clause refers to non-past (or not explicitly past)
processes.
2252693. The nominal phrase
or not with a preceding nominal constituent or index, regularly occur with no morpheme of any sort filling the syntactic position that would be occupied by /gá=/ if
they were to be marked as referring to past processes. This observation is illustrated
in the following example:
(260)Mā nǖkù-fa̋ʼü̃́ náʼa åkǘ nà-trataʼü̃́ i ̀ ñåà?
mā=nǖ =kù=fa̋-ʼü̃́

this is about, now?’ [jsg C168]
This observation questions whether the morpheme /gá=/ that marks subordinate clauses referring to past processes actually is to be analyzed as a
form of the linker. Analyzing it that way implies considering that the linker exhibits a defective distribution in its occurrences on subordinate clauses. Such an
analysis further implies to consider a syntactic constituent such as chà-bûʼgù ‘when I
was young’ in (257) as the syntactic equivalent of a nominal constituent, given that
the linker, in all of its other uses, can only be procliticized to nominal constituents.
Although the marker /gá=/ of subordinate clauses referring to past processes is
most likely cognate with the linker, it might in fact be better analyzed, from a synchronic perspective, as a separate morpheme rather than as an inflectional form of
the linker.","[271, 272, 273, 274, 275]"
"4115. Inflection of the predicative phrase5.2.3Indicative Inflectional Type (ind) out of
declarative main clauses(i) Uses in non-declarative main clauses. In non-declarative main
clauses, ind may be used with one of three different functions (on ind in declarative
main clauses, see the preceding section):
– it is found in polar interrogative utterances (in apparent free variation with
sbjv-ʼü̃́, see Section 5.2.6 below);
– it is regularly found in content interrogative utterances;
– it is commonly found in constructional association with ngi ̏ʼā ‘let’s go’ in (positive) exhortative utterances with a 4th person subject (bare sbjv is also
occasionally found in this context, see Section 5.2.5 below).
As shown in examples (458) and (459), ind occurs in interrogative utterances,
whether polar questions (as in (458)) or content questions (as in (459)). I have
not been able to detect any significant semantic or pragmatic distribution between
the use of ind and the equally frequent use of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in polar interrogative utterances.

(ii) Uses in dependent clauses. The use of ind is systematic in explicative
dependent clauses in ērǘ ‘because’ or ye̊rǘ ‘because.pst’. This use is illustrated
in the following example:

in main clauses for the expression of second person singular positive imperatives, as in the following two examples (see also (448b) above):
(462)Nűà nà-ũ!́nű-ànà=ṹprox.aloc-exo pcø.imp=go.sg‘Come (sg.) here!’ [amb 201]

different functions:
– encoding of a general positive directive meaning;
4135. Inflection of the predicative phrase
– expression of assertion (in combination with the morphemes /=na̋/ ‘assert’
or ta̋ ‘assert.expl’).
The directive meaning of bare sbjv in main clauses is compatible with any
person value of the subject. It is found with first and fourth person subjects with
an exhortative meaning (as in examples (464–465)), with second person subjects
with an imperative meaning (as in (466)), and with third person subjects with a
jussive meaning (as in (467)).

Of these associations, the one involving bare sbjv and second person plural
subjects (as in (466)) is probably the most common, given that it is apparently
the regular way to express a second person plural positive imperative. Bare sbjv
in main clauses seems to be much less likely to occur with subjects in other personnumber-nominal class combinations (as in (464–465) and (467)), at least in younger
speakers, who in such contexts typically replace bare sbjv with ind (case of a fourth
person subject, see Section 5.2.3 above) or with sbjv-ʼü̃́ in its deontic function
(case of a first or third person subject, see Section 5.2.6 below; see example (467)
for a case of vacillation between the use of bare sbjv and sbjv-ʼü̃́ for the expression
of a jussive meaning).
A rare use of bare sbjv in main clauses, which is likely derived from its general
directive meaning, is found in the expression of wishes and curses, as in examples
(468–469). These interpretations of bare sbjv likely rely on the constructional cooccurrence of other markers associated to them, such as ñȍʼkǜ ‘soon; if only …’ (in
wishes) or /tá=tà/ ‘fut?=add?’ (in curses).

Bare sbjv is also used in the expression of assertion, i.e. the expression of information that the speaker thinks does not, or may not, match with the assumptions
of the addressee or a third party (‘you know, …’, ‘this might not be what you/they
think, but …’). With this function, bare sbjv obligatorily co-occurs with the second position clitic /=na̋/ ‘assert’, as in example (470),263 or the utterance-initial
particle ta̋ ‘assert.expl’, as in (471). These two assertion markers have slightly

different meanings, with /=na̋/ being of more general use and ta̋ typically being
associated with the assertion of an explanation provided to account for some other
information present in the context.

(ii) Uses in dependent clauses. Apart from main clauses, bare sbjv is found
in two major kinds of dependent clauses:
– it is regularly found in circumstantial adverbial clauses in /...-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’
(‘when/if ...’), /...-ya̽ne̋/ ‘simult.circ’ (‘while ...’), rǜ … ‘and’ (‘while ...’),264

as in the following example:

̀ ǜ/ ‘man’ (‘in this
/ñṵmá=tà …/ ‘present.time=add’ (‘until ...’), and /...-ãk

– it is found in the rare polar interrogative complement clauses in na̋ …
‘assert’ or rǜ … ‘and’ (‘whether …’) and command complement clauses in
rǜ … ‘and’ (‘(tell) to …’).
The various uses of bare sbjv in circumstantial adverbial clauses are illustrated in examples (472–477). The use of bare sbjv in association with /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’
in its temporal meaning ‘when ...’ is exemplified in example (472). Its use with
/-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’ in its hypothetical meaning ‘if ...’ is exemplified in (473). Its use with
/-ya̽ne̋/ ‘simult.circ’ (‘while ...’) is exemplified in (474). Its use with rǜ … ‘and’
(‘while ...’) is exemplified in (475). Its use with /ñṵmá=tà/ ‘present.time=add’
̀ ǜ/ ‘man’ (‘in this or
(‘until ...’) is exemplified in (476). Finally, its use with /-ãk
that manner’) is exemplified in (477).

exemplified regularly require the constructional co-occurrence of other markers for
their correct interpretation, the following example from my corpus features a case
of bare sbjv circumstantial adverbial clause with no other marking than the
use of bare sbjv itself:

[lar T85]
ear, with whom I transcribed the text from which this utterance was extracted,
confirmed to me that it was perfectly acceptable as it stands, although the same
meaning could have been alternatively expressed with a rǜ + bare sbjv (‘while
…’) dependent clause. It thus seems that bare sbjv can function on its own as an
Inflectional Type specialized in the expression of circumstantial adverbial clauses.
Examples (479) and (480) illustrate the use of bare sbjv in polar interrogative and command complement clauses respectively. These two examples were
elicited. My corpus does not contain any instances of these rare, but apparently
natural-sounding, constructions.

(iii) Uses not related to clause type. The use of bare sbjv is obligatory in
relative clauses. The predicative phrase in bare sbjv then bears the relativizer suffix, which agrees in nominal class with the pivot (featuring the forms /-kǖ/ ‘rel.f’,
/-kǖ/ ‘rel.m’, /-(ʼǘ̃)nè/ ‘rel.n’, /-ʼè/ ‘rel.s’, and /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘rel.ns’), as illustrated in
the following examples:

Relative clauses are involved as components of the cleft sentences that constitute the strategy used for focalizing subject and (core) object arguments (on
the strategy employed for focalizing other constituents, see Section 5.2.6 below).
Example (484), in which the subject âi ‘wild felid’ is focalized, is to be compared
with the semantically equivalent plain sentence /Âi pē=tàʼkú-ē-ʼẽʼ́ e./ (wild.felid
2pl.acc=be.an.orphan-intr.pl-caus) ‘A jaguar has orphaned you.’.

Focalization of interrogative constituents in any syntactic function is optional
but frequent in content interrogative utterances, as shown in example (485) (see
also (502) and end of Section 5.2.6 below). In practice, interrogative utterances
featuring such focalization of the interrogative constituent do not seem to contrast
in any significant way from corresponding utterances featuring no focalization, as
in e.g. (459) above.

Bare sbjv is also obligatory in subordinate clauses in /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’. Because
subordinate clauses in /-ʼǘ̃/ are extremely frequent and occur in a wide array of
contexts—including in main clauses via insubordination—the uses of bare sbjv in
association with /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’ are treated separately, in Section 5.2.2 above (uses in
declarative main clauses) and in the next section (other uses).","[416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426]"
"6.1Semantics and syntaxThe verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ is semantically vague and may in principle refer
to virtually any kind of process. It will consequently be found with such diverse
translations as ‘do (like that), move (like that), say (like that), ask (like that), call
(like that), sound (like that), think (like that), decide (like that), etc.’.285 Its one and,
most of the time, stable semantic (and pragmatic) feature is its deictic function.
This deictic component may essentially target (or one might say “point at”) two
different kinds of objects, some of a linguistic (or minimally vocalic) nature, others
of an extra-linguistic nature. Note that the elements targeted by the deictic verb
are marked out by square brackets in all the examples presented throughout this
chapter.
In the first case, the ‘doing thus’ targets a piece of linguistic discourse as such
(i.e. primarily as a signifier in the Saussurean sense), or occasionally a non-linguistic
vocalic production (e.g. a melody), just produced or soon to be produced by the
speaker. The deictic verb can then be said to fulfill an endophoric function.286
This is not to say that the deictic verb is a filler, i.e. a semantically-empty verb whose only
function is to fill in the morphosyntactic position of a predicative phrase in cases where a speaker
finds him or herself unable to—or does not want to—use a semantically-determined predicative
phrase. This predicative-phrase-filler function is carried out by the interrogative-indefinite word åkǘ
‘what?.ns’ (or its extended variant /åkǘ-ʼǘ̃/ ‘what?.ns\sbjv?-rel.ns’), as in the following example:
285̃́ ǘkùchí.
(i) [...] chi ̋ wíʼá cauchito ì náwa̋ chā-åkǘʼü...chi ̋ wíʼá cauchito=ì

ǘ-kùchí
put.sg-in.sg‘[...] and I, uh... [lit. ‘and I somethinged ...’] I put a rubber band around it.’ [rca F42–43]
From Lyons’ perspective, this kind of deictic reference would possibly be analyzed as “pure
textual deixis” (like the kind of deictic reference involved by it in e.g. That’s a rhinoceros. – A what?

According to the nature of the endophoric target, which may be a mere name, a
complete utterance, a non-uttered cognitive content, an onomatopoeia, etc., the
deictic verb will be respectively translatable as ‘call target’ (as in example (581)),
‘say target’ (582), ‘think target’ (580), ‘make target’ (583), etc. The deictic
verb is especially pervasive in its use as a device introducing direct speech,
although direct speech does not obligatorily require its presence.

The target of the deictic component of the deictic verb may be, on the other
hand, a strictly extra-linguistic process. This is typically a gesture performed by
the speaker while they are uttering the deictic verb, but it may also be any physical
process being achieved by some other entity present in the utterance situation and
5026.1. Semantics and syntax
‘[...] when [the jaguar] took a step, it made “Flau!” [as its movements
cause some air to be ejected through a flute that was thrust into its anus].
It took another step and went “Flau! Flau!”’ [lar D166–168]
In this construction, the deictic verb functions as a semantically-empty auxiliary
verb whose only morphosyntactic function is to bear the encoding of the inflectional
values of the whole predicative phrase it forms together with the verbal lexeme that
constitutes its core object. Parallel examples by other speakers are needed, however, to confirm the status of this syntactic strategy as a genuine, grammaticalized
construction.
Interestingly, whether the target of the deictic verb is a piece of discourse, a gesture, an anaphoric, or a non-finite verb, its exact syntactic function cannot be established with certainty. As a corollary, whether the deictic verb is morphosyntactically intransitive or transitive appears to be an unanswerable question.
From a strictly morphosyntactic perspective, nothing definitively precludes from
analyzing the deictic verb’s target as a core object, since core objects in smat are
in the zero-case, i.e. are left morphologically unmarked for their syntactic function.
Thus, there is the possibility that the anaphoric ngēmà ‘that’ in example (585),
which stands in the zero-case, is indeed to be interpreted as the core object argument of the deictic verb. On the other hand, no language internal facts seem
to offer positive evidence for the analysis of the deictic verb’s target as its object.
Regular predicative phrases can be unequivocally told to be transitive or intransitive depending on whether or not they require the indexation of a core object in
contexts where, all other things being equal, they are not preceded by any syntactic NP (in the zero-case) that might function as their core object (thus fè ‘to
shoot’ in /kŏwǘ ná=fè/ [deer 3m/n/ns.sbj=shoot] ‘she/he shot the deer’ can be
definitively identified as a transitive verb because */ná=fè/ is not acceptable as
is with the meaning ‘he shot (it)’, which can only be conveyed by /ná=nā=fè/
[3m/n/ns.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=shoot], i.e. with the inclusion of an object index).
The inflectional paradigm of the deictic verb does not seem to display any marking
for object indexes, but this cannot be taken as definitive evidence for the verb’s
intransitive nature due to its morphological uniqueness in the language (see Section 6.2). In principle, it might simply be that the deictic verb, although transitive,
has the unique morphological ability to occur without an object index in contexts
where it lacks an object NP preceding it. These considerations leave open the
question of the syntactic relationship, if any, that holds between the deictic
verb and its target in smat. This is why I have opted for labeling the target with
a syntactically neuter term, instead of referring to as e.g. a complement.
5056. The deictic verb
The subject of the deictic verb is typically an animate referent, as in most
examples in this section, or less frequently a concrete, inanimate referent. But
it may also occasionally be an abstract entity, such as a speech, a story, a call,
a song, a thought, a person’s mind, etc. In such cases, the deictic verb does not,
strictly speaking, refer to a process (‘do thus’) being carried out by the subject. It can
rather be considered in practice as the equivalent of an equative verb, and functions
more specifically as a deictic equative verb (‘be thus’). Its specialized use is then
to introduce a linguistic, cognitive, or vocalic object that is being equated with
the subject. This is illustrated in example (618), where the ‘speaking’ (déʼà) that
is taking place is equated with, or defined as, the question enclosed in quotation
marks (see also example (594) below):

were their words [lit. ‘... thus did their speaking.’].’ [lar C404–405]
In addition to a subject argument, the deictic verb may optionally take an argument marked for the accusative case (to be distinguished from a core object,
which does not bear any syntactic-function marking, as mentioned above) in cases
where it specifically refers to an uttering-process (i.e. a piece of linguistic discourse
actually spoken). The referent of that argument is the addressee of the utteringprocess mentioned by the speaker. This is illustrated at the end of example (582)
above. Note that such accusative arguments may only consist of explicit nps as they
cannot be indexed on the deictic verb.
When used endophorically, the deictic verb is virtually always immediately
adjacent to the piece of linguistic discourse (or non-linguistic vocalic production) it points at. As a consequence, its arguments—whether a subject or a
complement in accusative—normally precede the deictic verb when the latter itself
5066.1. Semantics and syntax
precedes its target ((sbj) (acc) deictic.verb “target”). This is illustrated in the
following example (see also the beginning of example (582) above):289
(589)[...] tüʼ̂ ü̃̄ ãʼ̄ a gá ñâʼü:̃́ “Kū-chòʼpḛʼe mā níì-ĩ ̊ kùmà!” ñâʼü̃́ [...]

136]
Conversely, the arguments of the deictic verb normally follow the latter when it
itself follows its target (“target” deictic.verb (lk=sbj) (acc), or “target” deictic.verb (acc) (lk=sbj)).290 This is illustrated in the following example (see
also the end of example (582) above).

[jsg B264–265]
This strong ordering tendency, combined with the fact that the deictic verb cannot
bear indexes for syntactic functions other than subject, regularly leads to the otherwise relatively unusual presence of main constituents bearing case-marking (in this
See example (268), however, for an utterance in which the deictic verb (which precedes its
target) is exceptionally separated from it by its subject argument.
289Note that the linker regularly introduces such postposed subjects, as they have necessarily
already been referred to within the clause through the encoding of the subject argument included
in the inflected deictic verb. By contrast, complements in the accusative post-posed to the deictic
verb are usually not introduced by the linker, as they are then being referred to for the first time
within the clause (they cannot have been already referred to through indexation on the inflected
deictic verb, in particular). On the syntactic distribution of the linker, see Section 3.5.
2905076. The deictic verb
case, accusative case-marking) after an inflected predicative phrase. In other contexts, when a main nominal constituent occurs after an inflected predicative phrase,
dependent-marking on that constituent is typically avoided in favor of other strategies such as head-marking on the inflected predicative phrase (see Section 3.6.1).
As was noted above, the deictic verb is by far the most favored device resorted
to for introducing direct speech. Semantically more specific utterance verbs rarely
fulfill this function by themselves. It is therefore not rare for the deictic verb to
co-occur with a semantically more specific verb in what can be analyzed as
a unique case of serial-verb construction in the language. This construction
facilitates the use of semantically specific utterance verbs as (co-)introducers of
direct speech. In this construction, two finite predicative phrases featuring the
same subject and referring to the same event follow each other with no intonational
break. One of the two finite predicative phrases is the deictic verb (always inflected
in sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/). It is preceded by its endophoric target (e.g. a complete utterance in
direct speech), or occasionally followed by it, in cases where it occurs second of the
two finite predicative phrases. The other finite predicative phrase (which is, for
its part, freely inflected in any of the three Inflectional Types) refers lexically to a
specific type of uttering process (‘to say’, ‘to ask’, ‘to answer’, ‘to call’, ‘to rebuke’,
etc.). In most cases, the two predicative phrases involved in this construction are
arranged in the order just suggested:
[target] deictic.verb.sbjv-ʼü̃́PP1 specific.uttering.processPP2
although the opposite ordering also occurs:
specific.uttering.processPP1 deictic.verb.sbjv-ʼü̃́PP2 [target]
Examples (591) and (592) feature typical instances of this construction. Note that
the two finite predicative phrases in the construction under discussion may be separated by enclitics (such as /=ãʼ̄ a/ ‘quot’, which may occur between all sorts of
constituents in the language, and /=gá/ ‘pst’, which usually behaves as a secondposition clitic, in (591)) or by complements of the one that refers to a specific
uttering process (such as /tü̂-ʼü̃̄/ [3s-acc] ‘him’ in (592)).

[jsg B118]
Example (593) displays a variant of this construction in which the finite predicative
phrase that refers to a specific uttering process takes an expletive non-salientive
comitative complement /ná-máʼa/ (3n/ns-com), lit. ‘with it’. This complement
is anaphorically coreferential with the target and redundantly refers to the piece
of direct speech “with which” (i.e. uttering which) the specific uttering process is
performed.291

[lit. ‘... he said he shouted with it.’].’ [lar E178–179]
For what is likely an instance of the construction under discussion displaying the
rarer of its two ordering variants mentioned above (with the deictic verb occurring after, instead of before, the predicative phrase referring to a specific uttering
process), see example (596) below.
Note that the comitative relational noun /-máʼa/ is similarly used to mark e.g. the name argument of the verb ū (pcØ) ‘to call someone or something (Core obj) something (com)’. This morphosyntactic observation regarding a semantically comparable kind of predicative phrase supports
the analysis I propose for the complement námáʼa ‘with it’ optionally occurring in the construction
under discussion in the present section.
2915096. The deictic verb
Of all the interrogative-indefinite words, only ñùʼ(u), which I gloss as ‘what
activity?’, may occupy the syntactic position of target of the deictic verb. Åkǘ
‘what?.ns’ and ñùʼãk̀ ǜ ‘how?’, in particular, are not available in this position. Conversely, ñùʼ(u) may only occur as the target of the deictic verb, for which it serves as
a specialized interrogative-indefinite.292 In practice, ñùʼ(u) is most of the time realized in its shortened variant ñùʼ, especially by younger speakers (on this phonologically exceptional form featuring a glottal stop that surfaces in word-final position
without being followed by an epenthetic vowel, see Section 2.1.3.1). It always
immediately precedes the deictic verb. The following example features an instance
of ñùʼ(u) in its interrogative function:
(594)̄

“Ñùʼù ñâʼü̃́ i ̀ kúãʼ̋ è, nágù kùrǖ-ĩnǜʼü

your mind do like, [what does] what you’re thinking about [do like]?’]”’
[igs 227–228]
Although it is undoubtedly derived from the deictic verb, the invariable vagueness marker ñâʼü̃́ ‘about, something like’ is better treated as distinct from it from
a strictly synchronic perspective. This marker occurs at the end of an NP whose
literal meaning it qualifies as being only an indicative approximation used for establishing a vague referent. In most cases, this NP is a Spanish phrase inserted by
code-mixing, as in the following example:
(595)Nárǖ-ngǜgǘ, eh... hasta las cinco de la tarde ñâʼü.̃́
ná=rǖ=ngǜ-gǘhasta las cinco de la tarde ñâʼü̃́3m/n/ns.sbj=pcrǖ=rest-pl until.five.p.m.something.like‘[In a typical day, tourists do this and that. Then they come back.] They
rest, uh... like until five p.m.’ [jgs 158–159]
Although ñùʼ(u) is also present etymologically in the synchronically unanalyzable interrogativè ǜ/ ‘man’), ñùʼgù ‘when?’
indefinite words ñùʼãk̀ ǜ ‘how?’ (etymologically composed of ñùʼ(u) and /-ãk
(from ñùʼ(u) and /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ or /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’), and ñùʼré ‘how much? how many?’ (from ñùʼ(u) and
a bound morpheme */-ʼré/ ‘amount?’, on which see note 218).
2925106.2. Inflectional morphology
This marker ñâʼü̃́ likely arose through the grammaticalization of the sequence ‘target’ /ñâ-ʼǘ̃/ (“target’ do.thus.3m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv-rel.ns’), lit. ‘what they call
‘target”.","[505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516]"
"702.1. Segmental inventory2.1.2Vowel phonemesTable 5 provides an inventory of the language’s 6 vowel phonemes along with
their attested realizations. Contrasts between these phonemes are exemplified by
the set of (near-)minimal pairs displayed in Table 6.
The mid vowel phonemes transcribed as /e/ and /o/ in Table 5 are typically
realized as the genuine mid vowels [e̞] and [o̞] respectively (i.e. neither as the
close-mid vowels [e, o] nor as the open-mid vowels [ɛ, ɔ]).
The phoneme transcribed as /ɯ/ is typically realized as the unrounded close
back vowel [ɯ], although it may occasionally be slightly fronted into the unrounded
close central vowel [ɨ], especially when it immediately follows the palatal consonant phonemes /ʨ/ or /ʥ/, as in the following example:
(9) /ʨɯ34 ta3 /[ˈʨɯː34 t ̪a3 ]∼[ˈʨɨː34 t ̪a3 ]‘to get dark’Stressed syllables may feature one of two sequences of two vowel nuclei in a row,
specifically the sequences /ai/ and /au/. These are realized as the diphthongs [a͡ɪ]
and [a͡ʊ] respectively (or [ã͡ɪ ̃] and [ã͡ʊ̃] in nasal or nasalized syllables; see below), as
in examples (10a–10b), unless they are separated by a glottal stop on the surface,
as in (22c) (see Section 2.1.3.1). An additional sequence, /ou/ [o̞͡ʊ], is marginally
attested in onomatopoeic words, as in (10d), and in the interjection /ʔou43 / [ʔo̞͡ʊ43 ]
‘Yes?, What?’ (used in reply to someone else’s call). No other sequences of vowel
nuclei within a single syllable are attested in my data.

nasal syllables (as in the first syllable of the words in examples (11b), (12b), and

"5.3.5Reassignment of pci ̄ and pci ̀ predicative
phrases to pcrǖ caused by the introduction of
associated motionIntroducing the encoding of associated motion within an inflected predicative phrase belonging to predicative classes pci ̄ or pci ̀ has the apparent automatic effect of reassigning these predicative phrases to the predicative class
pcrǖ.
In practice, combinations of /yà=/ ‘am’ with the predicative class markers
/i ̄=/ or /i ̀=/ are ungrammatical. The combination /yà=rǖ=/, featuring the
pcrǖ marker /rǖ=/, is used instead. Combinations of /yà=/ ‘am’ with the fusional morphemes /yā=/ and /yà=/ simultaneously encoding predicative classes
pci ̄ or pci ̀ and a third person masculine/neuter/non-salientive (core) object index
(see Section 5.3.4) are equally ungrammatical. The combination /yà=nā=/, fea4355. Inflection of the predicative phrase
turing the fusional morpheme /nā=/ simultaneously encoding pcrǖ and a third
person masculine/neuter/non-salientive object index, is used instead. To contextualize this phenomenon within the whole inflectional paradigm of ind, see p.450,
Charts C–D (columns pci ̄ and pci ̀).
Contrast for instance the inflected predicative phrase /chi ̄=déʼà/ (1sg.sbj.pci ̄=
speak) ‘I speak’ (< /chā=i ̄=déʼà/ ‘1sg.sbj=pci ̄=speak’; see Section 5.3.2) with
/chā=yà=rǖ=déʼà/ (‘1sg.sbj=am=pcrǖ=speak) ‘I go and speak’. The lexical
predicative class pci ̄ of the verb déʼà ‘to speak’ is faithfully encoded in the former,
while it apparently shifts to pcrǖ in the latter, after the introduction of /yà=/ ‘am’.
This phenomenon might properly deserve identification as a case of grammatical reassignment, whereby a predicative phrase would change predicative class for
possibly semantic reasons. Note, however, that it can be alternatively analyzed as
a non-semantically-motivated strategy that allows to avoid phonologically dispreferred combinations such as */yà=i ̄=/ or */yà=yà=/. Under this scenario, the
morphemes /rǖ=/ and /nā=/, which originally belong to the inflectional paradigm
of pcrǖ, would have been extended into the inflectional paradigms of pci ̄ and pci ̀
for phonological reasons, displacing part of the distinctive inflectional morphology
of these two predicative classes. My decision to adopt the first of these two analyses
in this grammatical description is mainly based on practical reasons.
Note that the uncombinability discussed in this section might also affect pcnà,
with the possible effect of forcing the use of /yà=rǖ=/ ‘am=pcrǖ=’ and /yà=
nā=/ ‘am=pcrǖ.3m/n/ns.obj=’ instead of the expected combinations ? /yà=
nà=/ ‘am=pcnà=’ and ? /yà=nà=/ ‘am=pcnà.3m/n/ns.obj=’, respectively.
My data do not allow me to settle this question.","[440, 441]"
"2.1.3.1Same-syllable coda /ʔ/ belonging with a stressed
syllableIn practice, same-syllable coda /ʔ/’s may only be detected in monosyllabic (i.e.
not in polysyllabic) stressed morphemes. They are realized in all contexts, but
depending on the context they may be syllabified either as a coda [ʔ] or as an onset
[ʔ], and they may or may not trigger the emergence of an epenthetic vowel right
after them.
As shown in Figure 12, four situations may be distinguished, yielding three
different surface outputs for syllables containing a same-syllable coda /ʔ/.
(i) Situation 1.
If the morpheme the same-syllable coda /ʔ/ belongs to is not
a verb, or is a verb used non-predicatively (non-finite verb form), then on the
surface that morpheme acquires a second syllable whose onset is [ʔ] and whose
vowel nucleus is an epenthetic vowel (yielding [(C)Vː.ʔV] or [(C)V1 ː.ʔV2 ]). The
quality of that epenthetic vowel is determined by the underlying vowel nucleus of
the morpheme (see below).
Examples (21a–21b) display independent nouns containing a same-syllable coda
/ʔ/. Example (21c) shows a zero-derived nominalization of the verb /ʥɯʔ31 / ‘to
dance’, yielding the meaning ‘dancing’, followed by the locative case marker /-wa5 /
‘aloc’.

As an exception to this rule, these same realizations obtain when a verb used predicatively is immediately followed by the suffix /-∼ʔɯ4 / [...ʔɯ̃ 4 ] ‘sub’, by any
form of the relativizer suffix, or by the suffix /-ʔgu4/1 / [...ʔgu4 ]∼[...ʔgu1 ]
‘circ’. The former case is illustrated in example (23a) and the latter in (23b):23
(23)a. /∼da4 =deʔ34 -∼ʔɯ4 / [nã4 ˈd̪eː̞ 34 ʔe̞4 ʔɯ̃ 4 ] ‘(that) it’s yellow’b. /∼duʔ31 -ʔe1 /[ˈnũː31 ʔũ5 ʔe̞1 ]‘a short one (e.g. a machete)’As shown in Table 8, the epenthetic vowel that regularly arises in Situations 1
and 2 is in most cases a copy vowel identical in quality to the vowel nucleus of the
stressed syllable containing the same-syllable coda /ʔ/ (first five rows in Table 8).
In two cases (sixth and seventh rows), specifically when the vowel nucleus of the
stressed syllable containing the same-syllable coda /ʔ/ is an /a/ or what I label here
an /o2 /, the arising epenthetic vowel is [ɯ] rather than a copy vowel. Note that
the distinction exceptionally made in Table 8 between a subtype of the phoneme
/o/ represented as /o1 / and another one represented as /o2 / is a purely lexical
one: this distinction is only relevant in smat phonology in the present context and
reflects the fact that some—in practice, a majority of—stressed morphemes with
a same-syllable coda /ʔ/ featuring the nucleus /o/ trigger a mere copy vowel in
Situations 1 and 2 (these are represented here as featuring /o1 /), while others—in
practice, a minority—cause an [ɯ] to arise (these are represented here as featuring
/o2 /; for another instance of /o2 /, see example (21a) above).24 Finally, in cases
where the vowel nucleus of the stressed syllable containing the same-syllable coda
/ʔ/ is complex, i.e. when that nucleus is /ai/ or /au/ (last two rows), the position of
the epenthetic vowel is occupied by the second vowel component of that complex
vowel nucleus. Non-underlying syllables arising on the surface due to the insertion
of an epenthetic vowel after a same-syllable coda /ʔ/ belonging with a stressed
syllable are realized with a tone [3 ] (see end of Section 2.4.3 below), unless they
occur in a morphosyntactic context where morphotonological alternations apply
On the tonal realization of the non-underlying syllables arising due to the insertion of an
epenthetic vowel in these examples, see end of Section 2.4.3.
23This /o1 / vs /o2 / distinction, a strictly lexical one with no corresponding phonetic reality in
today’s language, possibly reflects the fact that a number of instances of the phoneme /o/ in contemporary smat (among which all cases of /o2 /) may have evolved diachronically from former *[a]’s
(or a phone close to [a]). This would explain why some /o/’s, specifically /o2 /’s, seem to behave
as /a/’s as far as the epenthetic vowel they trigger is concerned. On this complex question, see
Section 2.8.3.

The following example features a spontaneous case of alternation between an

‘She arrived there and she collected our wages [lit. ‘... and she collected.’].
She also collected hers, for working at the Early Childcare Center.’ [jsg
B444–446]
Unexpectedly, /-tàe/̄ ‘antip3’ is also occasionally suffixed to intransitive predicative phrases, which never occurs to the other two antipassive suffixes. This is
illustrated in example (417b) (example (417a), with a related but different meaning, is intended to demonstrate that the predicative phrase /i ̰-ãʼ̋ è/ [be.small-mind]
‘to play turbulently’ may be used intransitively on its own):

These few occurrences, where /-tàe/̄ ’s exact effect is unclear, indicate that strict
antipassivization may not be its only function. Very hypothetically, I suggest
that /-tàe/̄ ’s function in these cases might be to allow for the omission of an
extended core argument, i.e. a non-core argument required by the predicative
phrase’s lexical valency. This hypothesis seems especially plausible in view of an
example such as (418b). In this example, /-tàe/̄ is suffixed to a verb stem (/ǘ-a̰/
[put.sg-mouth] ‘to rebuke’) that normally requires a complement in the accusative,
as in (418a). In (418b), /-tàe/̄ ’s function thus seems to be that of allowing for the
absence of a non-core argument whose presence would otherwise be made obligatory by the verb stem in question.

‘After that, his wife started the roasting [lit. ‘... his wife roasted.’]. She

Suffixing /-tàe/̄ seems to entail the same predicative class shift to pcØ, although my
data are less clear on this specific point as far as this antipassive suffix is concerned.
The three antipassive suffixes only operate on predicative phrases’ valency and
do not involve systematic Aktionsart or referentiality effects. Depending on
the surrounding context, /-ètà/ ‘antip1’, for instance, may convey a notion of stativity and unreferentiality to the process. Such an effect occurs in example (422),
where /tá=chă-ètà-gǘ/ ‘they painted’ and /tà=wü̏-ètà-gü̋-ʼǘ̃/ ‘they wrote’ are to
be interpreted as ‘they knew how to paint in general’ and ‘they knew how to write in
general’):

knew how to paint, some already knew how to write.’ [igv 124–126]
Such effects are by no means automatic, however. In example (420) above, the
process referred to by /nà=ma̋-ètā-ʼü̃́/ ‘he had killed’, with the suffix /-ètà/, has a
telic Aktionsart (like the plain verb root ma̰ ‘to kill (sg.)’) and its contextually understood object (Ngutapa, whose murder was previously referred to by the storyteller)
is referential. The contrast between examples (419) and (421) above illustrates the
same point with the suffix /-ē/ ‘antip2’.
The homonymy of the antipassive suffix /-ē/ ‘antip2’ with the functionally unrelated suffixes /-ē/ ‘off.sg’ (on which see Section 4.2.3.5), /-ē/ ‘event.pred’
(Section 4.3.2), and /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ (Section 4.4.4) is intriguing.252 This homonyIt is all the more intriguing as the suffixes /-ē/ ‘antip2’, /-ē/ ‘off.sg’, and /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ all trigger the Pattern 2 morphotonological alternations (see Tables 36 and 37), a process that bound

my suggests that some of these four morphemes might be cognates, least implausibly the antipassive suffix /-ē/ ‘antip2’ and the intransitive plural marker /-ē/
‘intr.pl’, which occur in mutually exclusive contexts, with the former being suffixed only to transitive verb roots and the latter being suffixed only to intransitive
predicative phrases. Note, in any case, that there is no language-internal synchronic
evidence beyond phonological resemblance in support of such a hypothesis.
The synchronically unanalyzable (or only partially analyzable) intransitive verb
stems chăgüé ̄ ‘to fish with poison’, fènüē ̄ ‘to hunt’, tåʼē ‘to trade’, and wi ̄yāe ̄ ‘to sing’

verb roots that seem to no longer be in use (*chăgǘ, *fènǖ, *tåʼü, *wi ̄yā?).","[371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377]"
"6.2Inflectional morphology6.2.1Synchronic descriptionThe deictic verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’ is inflectionally extremely irregular. Its complete paradigm is shown in Table 48 (contrast it with the inflectional paradigm of regular predicative phrases shown in Charts A–M, pp. 449–
453).
Two forms, with a syllable in parentheses in Table 48, have alternative realizations in apparent free variation: /ngi ́-rǖgǜ/ ∼ /ngi ́-rǖrǖgǜ/ and /ña̋-tà[-ʼü̃́]/ (rare)
∼ /ña̋-tà-gǜ[-ʼǘ̃]/ (frequent). The latter pair of forms are occasionally truncated to
their first syllable, yielding ña̋, as in the following example:

[ano1 9–10]
The verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’ only rarely occurs in ind and imp in
my data. The vast majority of its occurrences in my corpus are in sbjv/-ʼü̃́/,
presumably because it is mostly found in narratives with the typical sequencing
(i.e. [+ant]) effect of sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/ (see Section 5.2.2). Occurrences of /ña̋-/ñâ-+
-((rǖ)gǜ)/ in bare sbjv are rare, and all of them co-occur with a relativizer or the
clause-level inflectional morpheme /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’. This is why sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/ forms (with
/-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’ set apart in square brackets) are reported in Table 48 instead of bare
sbjv forms. There is no reason to believe, however, that standalone bare sbjv

required (see Section 5.2.5). Such standalone forms could of course turn out to be
slightly different from the ones tentatively suggested in Table 48 by the bracketing
out of /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’ from the sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/ forms.
Especially noteworthy is the fact that the subject indexes of the verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+
-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’, when present, are for the most part encoded by means of suffixes (/-chā/ ‘1sg.sbj’, /-kū/ ‘2sg.sbj’, etc., which follow the stressed syllable of the
phonological word they belong to) instead of the functionally equivalent proclitics featured by the inflectional paradigm of regular predicative phrases (/chā=/
‘1sg.sbj’, /kū=/ ‘2sg.sbj’, etc., which precede the stressed syllable of the phonological word they belong to). Two inflectional forms of /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do
thus’ are even more exceptional: in /ngi ́-(rǖ)rǖgǜ/ ‘she does thus’ (ind) and /ngi ́[ʼǘ̃]/ ‘(that) she does thus’ (sbjv[/-ʼǘ̃/]), the exponent of the third person feminine
subject index, /ngi ́-/, is identical to the Allomorph 1 of the (stressed) pronominal
root /ngi ́-/ ‘3f’ (on the morphology of the pronominal roots, see Section 3.3.1).
Nowhere else in the inflectional paradigms of smat predicative phrases is the exponent of a subject index a stressed syllable, nor more specifically a personal root.293
Moreover, unlike regular predicative phrases, the deictic verb does not allow for
These two highly unexpected forms are unfortunately hard to interpret from a diachronic perspective. They could be analyzed as either inflectional fossils or late innovations.
2935126.2. Inflectional morphology
the indexation of arguments with any syntactic functions other than subject. It cannot receive the proclitics indexing arguments in accusative, in particular (on
these morphemes, see Section 5.7), although its valency does provide a position
for a syntactically explicit complement in accusative (see Section 6.1).
Another noteworthy morphological peculiarity of the verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/
‘do thus’, as discussed at the beginning of Section 6, is that it is best treated, from
a synchronic perspective, as a unique case of bipartite morpheme. This results
from the fact that its two separable morphological components, /ña̋-/ñâ-/ on the
one hand and /-((rǖ)gǜ)/ on the other—the latter being absent from certain inflectional forms—cannot be attributed separate functional contributions in today’s
smat and must consequently be considered to constitute a single functional unit.
Smat does not feature any other such bipartite morphemes.
Because the inflectional paradigm of /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’ is formally
so different from that of regular predicative phrases (and, among them, regular
verbs), the deictic “verb” could in strict logic be treated and labelled as a separate part of speech of its own, rather than as a verb. Note, however, that it inflects for the exact same categories as a regular predicative phrase (for Inflectional
Type in particular), and that it may receive at least a few derivational suffixes of
the (regular) predicative phrase (see Section 6.3). I call /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do
thus’ a “verb”, in the broad sense, insofar as only verbs, among the regular predicative phrases with which it patterns, similarly consist in a functionally unanalyzable
lexical form.
The manner deictic word ñâak̃̀ ǜ ‘in this manner’, which occurs with both endophoric and exophoric uses (on these notions, see Section 6.1), is very likely to
have resulted historically from the combination of a bare sbjv form *ñâ ‘do.thus.
̀ ǜ/ ‘man’, with
3m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv’ and the clause-level inflectional morpheme /-ãk
the literal meaning ‘in the manner of him/her/it doing like this’. Note however that
ñâak̃̀ ǜ has become unanalyzable and invariable in today’s smat, as shown in ex̀ ǜ/ (‘do.thus-1sg.sbj\sbjvample (597).294 In this example, a form like ? /ña̋-chà-ãk
man’) lit. ‘in the manner of me doing like this’ would have been expected otherwise, given that the subject of the main verb is a first person singular:This comment also applies to ñâak̃̀ ǜ in its frequent occurrences in association with the interrogative word ñùʼ(u) ‘what activity?’ yielding the invariable phrase ñùʼ(u) ñâak̃̀ ǜ ‘in what manner?
how?’ (on the interrogative word ñùʼ(u), see end of Section 6.1).

The general syntactic rules stated above do not always apply, however. Causee
arguments in causative constructions based on initially intransitive predicative
phrases may be treated as oblique arguments in the accusative—instead of
core objects, as expected—when specific syntactic and semantic conditions are met,
namely 1) when such causee arguments are represented by a full NP preceding
the predicative phrase and 2) when the corresponding referent is animate. This is
shown in example (427). This additional rule, while optional in most cases, seems
to be obligatory, at least for certain speakers, in the specific case where the causee
argument belongs to the salientive nominal class: contrast the ungrammatical sentence in example (428a) to its corrected form—with the salientive causee argument
in the accusative—in example (428b).

Occurrences of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ in my corpus are rather frequent on initially intransitive predicative phrases, while they are rare on initially transitive predicative phrases. In the latter cases, a causee referent is always morphosyntactically
present, whether as a syntactically explicit NP or as an index procliticized to the
predicative phrase. My data do not allow me to tell whether the causee referent
(which is in this case an oblique complement in the accusative) may be left out from
a causative construction derived from an initially transitive predicative phrase.
The suffix /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ does not alter the predicative class of the predicative
phrases it attaches to. The causative constructions featured in examples (423–
428) above are all based on predicative phrases that initially belong to pcØ and
thus all display derived predicative phrases inflecting in pcØ. The causative constructions in (429) and (430) are based on predicative phrases that initially belong
to pcrǖ and pci ̀, respectively, and therefore display derived predicative phrases
inflecting in these same predicative classes.

The ordering of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ relative to other non-inflectional morphological

the other hand, the scope relationship between /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ and the feature of associated motion—an inflectional feature in smat, only available in finite forms of
predicative phrases (see Section 5.8)—is grammatically unspecified and its interpretation relies on context. In other words, whether a predicative phrase simultaneously featuring /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ and associated motion is to be interpreted as meaning
‘[cause to [go/come and ...]]’ (involving motion of the causee) or ‘[go/come
and [cause to ...]]’ (involving motion of the causer) is context-dependent.
The following example may thus be interpreted as involving motion of either the
causee or the causer, or even motion of both participants:
(431)Chāyà-péʼẽʼ́ e.chā=yà=pé-ʼẽʼ́ e1sg.sbj=am.3m/n/ns.obj=sleep-caus‘I cause him to go and sleep [e.g. I tell my son to go to bed without moving
myself.].’
‘I go and cause him to sleep [e.g. I go back home from fishing and rock my
baby to sleep.].’
‘I go with him and cause him to sleep [e.g. I walk my drunk husband back
home after a party and put him to bed.].’ [jsg elic.]
My data do not allow me to tell whether the stacking of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’, i.e. the
suffixation of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ to a predicative phrase that already contains an occurrence
of it, is grammatical. Interestingly, however, the antipassivization of a causative
construction in /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ by suffixing it with /-tàe/̄ ‘antip3’ is attested, as shown in
the following example:

3764.5. Valency operations
The semantics of causative constructions derived with /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ cover a
very wide array of causation situations.255 Depending on the context, causative
constructions in /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ may thus be varyingly translated in English as e.g. ‘cause to
do’ or ‘induce to be’, ‘make do, order to do, force to do’ or ‘allow to do, let do, put
in conditions to do’, etc. In particular, the occurrence of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ is not restricted
to predicative phrases with specific semantic characteristics (e.g. only stative
or only dynamic predicative phrases). Its occurrence does not specify—or is not
constrained by—whether the causee is animate or inanimate (contrast (427) and
(429) respectively), whether it has or does not have control (contrast (426) and
(433)), or whether it is willing or unwilling (contrast (434) and (430)).

As for the causer argument, it may be acting both directly or indirectly (contrast
(427) and (426)). A spontaneous example such as (435), where the causer and
the causee (a reflexive pronoun) are coreferential, as well as the third translation

option for the elicited utterance in example (431), suggest that the causer may be
itself physically involved in the process carried out by the causee, although in most
cases it is not. My data do not, however, allow me to tell whether the causer may
be inanimate (as opposed to animate, which it always is in my data) or whether the
causer’s action may be accidental (as opposed to intentional, which it always is in
may data).

caused himself to be there under the shape of chambira palm spines.’].’ [jsg
B93]
In one example in my corpus, a causative construction with coreferential causer
and causee arguments (with the latter represented by a reflexive pronoun) is used
to express that the process is artificially simulated (with lit. ‘to cause oneself
to ...’ conveying the meaning of ‘to pretend to ...’). The jaguar who killed the
mythical hero Ngutapa pretends he cannot speak at the moment so as to elude
questions by Ngutapa’s sons:

toothache [...].’ [lar C502]
The /-ʼẽʼ́ e/-causative form of the verb root ngǜ ‘rest’—/ngǜ-ʼẽʼ́ e,/ lit. ‘to cause
someone to rest’—has the lexicalized meaning ‘to help (someone)’. The synchronically unanalyzable verb stem g̃ʼŭʼẽʼ́ e ‘to wait for someone’ was most likely historically derived as the /-ʼẽʼ́ e/-causative form of a former verb root *g̃ʼŭ no longer
existing in today’s smat.
On the rarer factitive construction, whose functions partially overlap with
those of the causative construction in /-ʼẽʼ́ e/, see the end of the next section.
3784.5. Valency operations4.5.3Valency operations with no dedicated4.5.3.1Passive constructionexponenceIn smat, the more patient-like argument of a transitive predicate (syntactically
represented as a core object in the transitive construction) may by no means be
omitted from an utterance without the simultaneous addition of dedicated derivational morphology to the predicative phrase (on the antipassive suffixes /-ètà/, /-ē/
and /-tàe/̄ , which allow such an omission, see Section 4.5.1). By contrast, the more
agent-like argument of a transitive predicate (syntactically represented as a subject
in the transitive construction) may be omitted from an utterance without the addition of any specific derivational morphology to the predicative phrase. When this
occurs, the predicate merely becomes intransitive and the more patient-like
argument is promoted to the syntactic function of subject, i.e. the only core
argument position left in the resulting utterance. I call “passive construction” this
intransitive use of typically transitive predicative phrases with no derivational morphology involved. Contrast the ordinary transitive construction in example (437a),
where both agent and patient referents are overtly mentioned, with the passive
construction in (437b), where only the patient referent is retained:

Examples (438a) and (438b) illustrate the exact same contrast in spontaneous textual examples:

Examples (439) and (440) feature both a passive construction and an ordinary transitive construction involving the same verb, specifically the verb root wü̏ ‘to scratch,
to write’ in (439) (with the passive construction coming first and the transitive construction coming next) and the verb root yĕ ‘to chop down (smaller trees)’ in (440)
(with the two constructions occurring in the reverse order; note that the verb root
tūʼu ‘to fell (bigger trees)’ at the end of (440) also appears in a passive construction):

The passive construction in smat does not seem to allow for the overt expression of an agent participant (e.g. as an oblique equivalent to English ‘by ...’).
The passive construction does not affect the predicative class of the predicative phrase it is applied to. In examples (438a) and (438b) above, for instance,
the predicative phrase /g̃ü̊-ègù/ (slant?-inv) ‘to flip over’ is inflected in the predicative class pcØ in both its ordinary transitive and its passive uses. Similarly, in
the following example, /då-yé/ (chop-in.the.middle) ‘to cut in halves’ is inflected in
pci ̄ in a passive construction, in the same way as when it occurs in a transitive construction256 (compare also the two occurrences of the verb root yĕ ‘to chop down’
in (440), which both feature pci ̄ inflection):

Although the passive construction gets a stative-resultative reading in most
of its uses, this Aktionsart feature is only implied as a tendency rather than being
intrinsic to that construction. The following example displays a case of passive
construction with a telic reading, which is evidenced by the presence of an adjunct
providing a punctual temporal reference for the event referred to:257

intransitively and transitively derives from a specific lexical property of that predicative phrase, namely its lability, and 2) that there is no directionality of any kind
between the intransitive uses and the transitive uses of such predicative phrases,
which tend to indiscriminately occur in both intransitive and transitive constructions. However, although the passive construction is in practice relatively rare in
discourse, it seems that at least a vast majority of transitive predicative phrases may
be submitted to it. Its high productivity inclines me to treat it as a morphosyntactic construction typically available to any transitive predicative phrase, rather than
as an alternative use of particular predicative phrases allowed by specific properties
of the latter. On the other hand, predicative phrases that may occur in the passive construction are in practice used transitively in the vast majority of their
occurrences in discourse. This significant differential in frequency between transitive (frequent) and passive (rare) uses of these predicative phrases suggests some
sort of directionality between the two uses, with transitive uses being more primary and passive uses being more secondary. This is why I have opted for treating
the passive construction as a morphosyntactic operation that derives intransitive
constructions from predicative phrases that are intrinsically transitive.","[378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388]"

The “focal” suffixes /-rǜ/ ‘as.for.it’ and /-ʼrü̋/ ‘in.peace’, of much more restricted use, are for their part only attested on non-locative demonstrative
roots in my data (i.e. not on pronominal and locative demonstrative roots, nor
on any well-formed NP being able to stand on its own, including whole endo- or
exophoric demonstratives). The former mostly survives, in fact, in the invariable
and synchronically unanalyzable discourse connector ngērǜ ‘as.for.it’ (see example (206)), which is in practice often left unstressed and realized as ērǜ (as in
(207)). This discourse connector essentially signals a shift of topic, often involving
a comparison or a contrast with a previous topic, and immediately follows the new
main topic (which may already be marked by the clitic /=rǜ/ ‘top’, as in (207)).215

This discourse connector can be considered as a lexicalized form of the synonymous
morphologically complex form /ngē-rǜ/ ‘med.ns-as.for.it’. Such synchronically
analyzable forms made of a demonstrative root—whether medial or distal—
regularly inflecting for nominal class plus the “focal” suffix /-rǜ/ ‘as.for.it’
still exist, although they are much rarer than the lexicalized invariable form ngērǜ/
ērǜ ‘as.for.it’ to which they have given rise. The demonstrative root—the medial
one in any context and optionally the distal one in pre-hodiernal past contexts
specifically—then agrees in nominal class with the main topic of the utterance.
Thus /yĭ-rǜ/ (med.m-as.for.it) ‘as for it’ in (208) agrees with the masculine participant pōʼi ̋ ‘plantain’, the main topic of this non-pre-hodiernal-past utterance.

The “focal” suffix /-ʼrü̋/ ‘in.peace’ too is only attested in direct association
with a medial or distal demonstrative root. The resulting forms indicate that the
referent of the demonstrative root is or should be left in peace or aside, i.e. away
from involvement in any potential process. They mostly occur as the predicative
complement of the verb i ̃̊ ‘be’, as in example (209), or in clauses lacking an inflected
predicative phrase altogether, as in (210–211) (note that the extremely awkward
literal translations provided in these two examples are calqued on English constructions such as ‘Away with poverty!’ or ‘Off with his head!’ and are merely intended
to give a sense of the original construction).216

“focal” suffix /-ʼàkǜ/ ‘approx’. The resulting forms (e.g. ngéʼàkü,̀ yi ̆ʼàkü,̀ yi ̂ʼàkü,̀ etc.) are apparently
used in contexts similar to the ones described in this paragraph for /-ʼrü̋/ ‘in.peace’ and with a

Unexplainably, these forms may also be directly inflected like predicative phrases,
with the meaning ‘to leave X in peace’, ‘to forget about X’ (with X being the referent
of the demonstrative root), as shown in the following example:

96]
In my data, the demonstrative roots, when they are directly suffixed with a “focal” suffix and are therefore left unspecified by /-à/ ‘exo’ or /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’,
happen to always exhibit an endophoric function (anaphora/cataphora or discourse deixis), i.e. to behave semantically and pragmatically as though they bore
the suffix /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’. This might be due to chance, however, and need not
necessarily imply that the demonstrative roots are in fact inherently endophoric,
unless explicitly specified as exophoric by the suffix /-à/ ‘exo’. It could be that in
cases where the demonstrative roots are morphologically unspecified for exo- or
endophoricity, their exact function is in fact to be interpreted contextually. This
interesting question could be easily settled by further research.","[243, 244, 245, 246, 247]"

Note that the non-locative endophorics are not obligatory in this function.
In the following example, where four different generic categories of criminals are
mentioned and distinguished from one another by means of relative clauses, only
the NPs referring to the first (ngēmà ma̋et̀ āʼü̃́ ‘the one who has committed a murder’)
and the third (ngēmà chîʼēʼü̃́ üğ üʼ̋ ü̃́ ‘those who have done a wrong’) categories involve

Interestingly, the use of the smat endophorics as definite determiners is not
limited to NPs modified by a relative clause, but may also extend to NPs modified
by other modifiers such as the numerals, as in example (184), or the modifier
independent noun ‘other’, as in (185).
2273.4. Non-locative demonstratives
endophoric ño̊má with the suffix (or bound noun?) /-ǜ̃kǘʼü/ ‘time’, yielding the
̃̀ ʼ́ ü ‘these days’, relates to this function of the proximal endophoric
form ño̊máüküdemonstrative. See also examples (T15), (T17), and (T85) for uses of ño̊má in head
syntactic position in association with the relational noun /-ʼǜ̃/ ‘state’, yielding the
meaning ‘in this state [in which one of us is while we’re talking]’.
In this function, however, the proximal endophoric demonstrative is in most
cases replaced by the proximal exophoric in younger speakers, as in the following example, where the proximal exophoric ño̊má would have been equally correct and would have conveyed the same meaning (see also (159) above, where the
proximal exophoric dômà could probably have been used instead of the proximal
exophoric dâà):

Certain occurrences of the proximal endophoric demonstrative do not appear to
quite correspond to this “symbolic use”, however, as in examples (188–189). It
is unclear what its exact semantic and pragmatic value is in these rare occurrences.
The discourse contexts of (188) and (189) would rather have led to expect a medial
or distal endophoric demonstrative with an ordinary anaphoric function, instead of
a proximal endophoric, since the referents in question have been previously established as topics.

On a non-demonstrative grammaticalized use of the proximal endophoric
ño̊má as a near-preposition meaning ‘like’, see Sections 3.6.3 (ño̊má may also occasionally function as a near-conjunction meaning ‘while, as long as’).
Like their exophoric analogs discussed at the end of the preceding section, the
specifically plural salientive forms of the endophoric demonstratives (column s.pl
in Table 33) are used in marginal cases where the speaker wants to make explicit that they are referring to a plural, not singular, referent assigned to the
salientive nominal class. The default salientive forms (column s) can indiscriminately be used in reference to both singular or plural referents. An occurrence of
the specifically plural salientive distal endophoric is provided in example (190).
Because at this particular moment of the conversation, both the speaker’s mother
(a singular referent assigned to the salientive nominal class) and her brothers (a
plural referent equally assigned to salientive) are highly activated topics, she uses
a specifically plural salientive form (specifically, in this pre-hodiernal past context,
̀ àtá) to make clear that she is referring to the latter. In such a context,
the distal gŭãm
the corresponding default salientive form (gûʼèmá) could have been misinterpreted
as referring to her mother (although in this particular case, the plurality of the
referent is redundantly encoded by the plural marker /-gǘ/).

duces a referent from the text-external world (while Lambrecht also discusses the
existence of presentational constructions that introduce entities that are not present
in the speech setting; 1994:39, 177–181).
This construction involves a non-locative demonstrative functioning as the
predicative complement of the verb i ̃̊ ‘be’. In most cases, the subject is syntactically present, in which case it always follows the verb i ̃̊. Note that the latter,
when inflected in the Indicative Inflectional Type, may be omitted (as in (160) and
(200); it cannot be omitted, by contrast, when it is inflected in the Subjunctive
Inflectional Type, as in (199)), as is regularly the case when it occurs as the main
verb of a clause. This construction may be summarized as follows:
non-locative.dem (3sbj=be) (lk=NPsbj )
In most cases, the non-locative demonstrative employed in this construction is
an exophoric demonstrative in /-à/ ‘exo’ (see Section 3.4.2). The three grammatical degrees of distance of the demonstratives (prox, med, dist) then take their
regular physical range interpretation. Example (196) illustrates the case of a presentational construction involving a proximal exophoric non-locative demonstrative: the referent introduced is located in the very hand of the speaker (see
(160) above and (T18) for additional cases of proximal presentational construction).

were taking something from the pocket of his pants], keep going!” they

A case of presentational construction involving a medial exophoric demonstrative
is provided in (197): the referent introduced is located at a short distance from both
speaker and hearer.

‘Here [lit. ‘There ...’] is the house [i.e. at a short distance]!’ [jsg elic.]
Finally, a case of presentational construction involving a distal exophoric demonstrative is provided in (198): the referent introduced is coming from far away from
both speaker and hearers. Note that in this example the distance implied is emphasized by prosodic means, specifically through the lengthening of the stressed
syllable of the distal demonstrative.

In some cases, presentational constructions involving an exophoric non-locative
demonstrative seem to convey a locational meaning (X is here.) instead of fulfilling a genuinely presentational function (Here is X!). The speaker in (199) has just
found that the heap of corn that she asked her daughter-in-law to make beer with
this morning is still in the exact same place when she comes back home in the afternoon. The demonstrative dâà here is probably better interpreted as a locational
predicate.

2353. The nominal phrase
Interestingly, the non-locative demonstrative employed in the presentational
construction may also be a medial endophoric demonstrative in /-ma̽/ (see Section 3.4.3). The medial endophoric is used in cases where, for some reason, the
referent introduced, although present in the speech setting, cannot be identified by pointing at it, i.e. in cases where it is not accessible to the visual perception
of speaker or hearer (or both of them). In example (200), the speaker is shouting
from a distance to his addressees, who have just stolen his axe and are running away
with it. The referent introduced by the presentational construction, specifically the
axe, is therefore not visible to the speaker and cannot be pointed at, although it is
visible to the hearer (see (593) for a parallel example where the item stolen from
the speaker is a plantain offshoot).
(200)“Ngémà í chôʼrǖ pĕtā-pe̋tà rǜ ngímáʼa pī-üğ ǘànē!”

In (201), the mythical figures Yoi and Ipi are hearing characteristic noises in the
distance, from which one of them deduces that the creature that ate up their father
must be finally arriving. The referent introduced is invisible to both speaker and
hearer, although physically present.

In (202), finally, the speaker (located in the interfluvial Tikuna community of
Buenos Aires) is most likely addressing her message to the hearer (located in San
Martín de Amacayacu) over the radio. At utterance time, the hearer (and possibly
also the speaker) cannot see the referent being introduced (the hearer’s brother),
although the latter is considered by the speaker as present, in a broad sense, in this
far from prototypical speech setting.

The proximal and distal endophoric non-locative demonstratives do not occur
in the presentational construction in my data.214
Interestingly, however, the proximal endophorics—at least—are probably able to occur in presentational constructions in Cushillococha Tikuna, where they possibly imply that the referent introduced is especially close to the deictic center although it is not visible. This is suggested by the forms
<ño2 ma2 ma3 > (whose likely smat reflex would be /ño̊-má=mā/ ‘med.ns-anaph=precisely’) and
<do23 ma4 ma2 > (smat /dô-mà=mā/ ‘med.n-anaph=precisely’) recorded by Anderson & Anderson (2016:31, 197). These forms are defined by the authors as ‘to be coming, to be approaching’,
with the former applying to ‘a dangerous animal or a dangerous person’ (i.e. to referents typically
assigned to the non-salientive nominal class) and the latter applying to a ‘motor boat, [a] motorbike, [a] car, [or a] plane’ (i.e. to referents typically assigned to the neuter nominal class). The most
plausible interpretation of this unusual translation of nominal forms by verbal phrases is that the
authors observed them employed in presentational constructions where they actually meant ‘Here
it is [very close to us although we don’t see it]!’ (with ‘it’ referring to a threatening entity or to a
vehicle, respectively). If this interpretation of Anderson & Anderson’s (2016) data is correct, then it
is possible that the proximal, and perhaps also the distal, endophorics are also able to occur in presentational constructions in smat, potentially with pragmatic implications of particular proximity
or remoteness of the referent introduced with respect to the deictic center, who does not have visual
perception of that referent. This interesting hypothesis (which would imply that some Tikuna varieties have grammatical means in at least one construction to refer exophorically to invisible physical
entities and simultaneously specify whether that invisible entity is located especially close to or far
away from the deictic center), certainly a fragile one at this stage, could be easily confirmed or
invalidated by further research. Note that it is not incompatible, in any case, with Skilton’s (2019)
demonstration that the Cushillococha Tikuna reflex of smat’s medial endophoric, when used exophorically in reference to invisible entities, may refer to entities located at any distance from the
deictic center, including on their own body (e.g. in reference to a speaker’s tooth) or beyond the
horizon (e.g. a remote town). It could be that among the endophorics, the medial one functions as
the default choice in invisible exophoric uses, without however preventing occasional uses of the
2142373. The nominal phrase3.4.6Non-locative demonstrative roots bearing a
“focal” suffixMost bound morphemes that may be attached to nominal constituents are normally bound to whole, well-formed NPs that could equally well stand on their own
in discourse. As a consequence, such bound morphemes may normally only be
attached to a whole exophoric or endophoric demonstrative, i.e. to a morphologically complex form made of a demonstrative root augmented with either
/-à/ ‘exo’ or /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’, and not to a demonstrative root alone, which cannot
constitute a well-formed NP on its own.
The “focal” suffixes, however, are usually—but not always obligatorily—
attached directly to a demonstrative root in cases where that demonstrative
serves as a syntactic head (i.e. not as a modifier) and has a syntactic function
that corresponds to the zero case (i.e. a syntactic function that does not require any
specific marking). In other words, a non-locative demonstrative such as the nonsalientive endophoric /ngē-mà/ (med.ns-anaph) ‘that one’, when combined with
the “focal” suffix /-ʼi ́ka̋/ ‘only’, may yield either /ngē-mà-ʼi ́ka̋/ (med.ns-anaphonly) ‘only that one’ or the less expected form /ngē-ʼi ́ka̋/ (med.ns-only) ‘only that
one’ (but /ngē-mà-máʼa-ʼi ́ka̋/ (med.ns-anaph-com-only) ‘only with that one’, not
*/ngē-máʼa-ʼi ́ka̋/, given the presence of syntactic function marking; and /ngē-mà
chi ̆ʼnǘ-ʼi ́ka̋/ (med.ns-anaph pineapple-only) ‘only that pineapple’, not */ngē chi ̆ʼnǘʼi ́ka̋/, due to the modifying function of the demonstrative). These two options apparently stand in free variation, although the latter (dem.root-“focal”.suffix)
seems to be preferred.
In my corpus, the only widely productive “focal” suffixes attested directly on
a demonstrative root are /-ʼi ́ka̋/ ‘only’, as in examples (203–204) (see also (T44)),
and /-ʼi ̋rà/ ‘first’, as in (205). Interestingly, in (204), the demonstrative ngē(ʼi ́ka̋)
‘(only) that’ is left in the zero case and its syntactic function as an accusative complement of the verb ū ‘say’ is marked by means of a co-referent accusative index
on that verb (/nǖ=/ ‘3m/n/ns.acc’; lit. ‘this only I say it with you’) instead of
being marked by means of an accusative suffix on the demonstrative itself (which
would presumably have yielded /ngē-mà-ʼü̃̄-ʼi ́ka̋/ (med.ns-anaph-acc-only), with
the suffix /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’, due to the presence of syntactic function marking).
proximal or distal ones instead in cases where speakers intend to specify the distance range that
separates the referent from the deictic center.","[231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243]"
"In the following elicited example, however, a positive existential indefinite (g̃eʼ̀ ta̋
‘where?.aloc’) co-occurs with tãů ‘neg’ within a single negative clause:

It might thus be that negative polarity in prohibitive utterances always has to be marked by
tãů ‘neg’, regardless of whether existential indefinites are present in the clause or not—while in
declarative and interrogative utterances (see Section 7.5 above), these existential indefinites, if
present, would have been the regular locus for the encoding of negative polarity. However, it
might also be that the example cited above is a rarer and somewhat artificial alternative to an
expected (but unattested) ? Tåʼúwa̋ tā kù-ũʼ̂ ü!̃́ [lit. ‘Go nowhere!’], where negative polarity would be
encoded within the negative existential indefinite (tåʼúwa̋ ‘nowhere’) itself. The details of the smat

hardly or plainly unanalyzable synchronically but are obviously composed diachronically of the non-salientive form of the medial or distal non-locative
demonstrative root (i.e. /ngē-/‘med.ns’ or /ye̊-/ ‘dist.ns’) plus a bound morpheme which in certain cases may still be identified with some degree of certainty.
These forms all exist under two inflectional forms, one, starting with /ngē-/, being a default form unspecified for nominal tense, and the other, starting with /ye̊-/,
2433. The nominal phrase
being a specialized form optionally used to make it explicit that the utterance it
is part of refers to pre-hodiernal past processes. The pre-hodiernal past form of
several of them, however, appears to be very uncommon in spontaneous speech, at
least in younger speakers.
While all of these forms are historically based on deictic roots, only two have
retained a clear deictic meaning, and more specifically a discourse deictic one,
by involving reference to a circumstance alluded to in the preceding discourse
́ a̋/ye̊ʼküŕ üw
́ a̋ ‘(in) those
(ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá ‘(at) that time; that way’ and ngēʼküŕ üw
days’). The other five ngē-/ye̊- words can be considered to no longer feature any
deictic meaning. In spite of their non-deictic nature, I briefly mention them in this
section on the smat demonstratives inasmuch as they are derived etymologically
from deictic words.
Three of the ngē-/ye̊- words are circumstantial independent nouns (respectively meaning ‘(at) that time; that way’, ‘(in) those days’, and ‘(in a) recent time’).
These are discussed first below. The remaining four are discourse connectors (‘because; but’, ‘and; so that, while’, ‘or better still (?)’, ‘according to it (?)’) and are
discussed next.
(i) Ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá ‘(at) that time; that way’.
In most of its occurrences,
this ngē-/ye̊- circumstantial independent noun refers to a relatively well circumscribed temporal setting commented upon in an immediately preceding
stretch of discourse. In the following example, ngēʼgùmá refers to a particular
moment of the speaker’s childhood that was the temporal background of events
that have been the main topic of the preceding stretches of discourse:
(216)Chàʼíka̋ níì-ĩ ̊ gá mā chà-yăʼü̃́ gá ngēʼgùmá.chà-ʼíka̋ níì=ĩ ̊

For temporal uses of this ngē-/ye̊- word in its pre-hodiernal past form ye̊ʼgúmá, see
example (305) above and (T31–T32).
Ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá also occasionally refers not to a temporal setting, but to the
way in which a previously mentioned process unfolds. In this meaning, it fre2443.4. Non-locative demonstratives
quently bears the suffix /-ʼrü̋ʼǜ̃/ ‘like’, usually acquiring the precise meaning of ‘in
a way similar to that’, as in the following example (see also (T80)):
(217)M̂mm, chòmà rǜ tà ngēʼgùmárüʼ̋ ü̃̀ chòmáʼa ná-gûʼchà.

‘Yeah, me too it’s hard for me like that way.’].’ [igv 601]
In the absence of /-ʼrü̋ʼǜ̃/ ‘like’, ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá exactly means ‘by so doing, by
doing what was just referred to’ (i.e. literally ‘that way’), as in (T154).
Finally, ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá additionally occurs in a lexicalized form in the probably synchronically unanalyzable word /ngēʼgùmá(-)ré/ ‘that much, that many’,217
which refers to a quantity mentioned in preceding stretches of discourse. Example (218) provides an occurrence of ngēʼgùmáré. Note that in this particular
example, endophoric reference seems to be employed, rather unusually, as a summarizing device: the endophoric demonstrative ngēʼgùmáré apparently stands as a
generic quantifier that fills the syntactic position of the specific numeral that was
actually uttered in the original situation reenacted by the speaker in an abridged
fashion (as shown by the example’s translation, the English demonstratives this and
that can be used for the same pragmatic purposes).

318–319]
A pre-hodiernal past form *ye̊ʼgúmáré corresponding to ngēʼgùmáré is unattested in my data,
although it can reasonably be assumed to exist based on the existence of the pre-hodiernal past
form ye̊ʼgúmá corresponding to ngēʼgùmá ‘(at) that time; that way’.
2172453. The nominal phrase
Ngēʼgùmáré is obviously analyzable, from a diachronic perspective at least, as being
composed of ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá plus a bound morpheme */-ʼré/ ‘amount (?)’.218 The
fact that this quantity-specifying endophoric demonstrative is derived from a manner anaphoric demonstrative and therefore possibly literally means ‘the amount of
that way’ (see preceding paragraph) might reflect the fact that amounts used to be
conceived of by former speakers of the language (but most likely no longer are) as
concepts that are communicated by gestures, i.e. through a procedure, specifically
a way of moving one’s body.
The second and third syllables of the forms ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá are likely analyzable, from a diachronic perspective, as the locative relational noun /-gu̽/
‘ploc’219 and the suffix /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’, respectively, although it is unclear how
such a morphological association may have arisen historically.
́ a̋/ye̊ʼküŕ üw
́ a̋ ‘(in) those days’.
(ii) Ngēʼküŕ üw
This rare ngē-/ye̊- circumstantial independent noun is only attested in elicited data and might be somewhat
old-fashioned. It refers to a vaguely delimited temporal setting commented
upon in an immediately preceding stretch of discourse. The bound morpheme
/-ʼkǘrǘwa̋/ which obviously composes this ngē-/ye̊- word is also found in other more
easily analyzed forms referring to vague time periods (in particular, /nůʼkǘmákǘrǘwa̋/ (past.time-times?) ‘in the old days’ and /ñṵmá-kǘrǘwa̋/ (present.timetimes?) ‘these days’).
(iii) Ngēʼwa̋kà/ye̊ʼwa̋kà ‘(in a) recent time, recently’.
This ngē-/ye̊- word,
which I analyze as a circumstantial independent noun, refers to a past time that
is recent relative to the temporal setting of the processes being referred to. It
mostly functions as an adjunct, in which case it may be translated as ‘recently’
This bound morpheme is found in lexicalized form in the synchronically unanalyzable or hardly
analyzable words ñùʼré ‘how much? how many?’, nôʼré ‘be little, be few’, düʼ̀ ré ‘this much, this many
(demonstratively)’, and possibly tăʼré ‘two’ (</tă-ʼré/ [4-amount?] ‘the amount of you and I’?).
218Today’s suffix /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ probably used to have a pre-syllabic coda glottal stop, displaying a
form */- ʼ gu̽/ homonymous with the likely cognate circumstantial subordinator /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’. This
pre-syllabic glottal stop is exceptionally retained in the locative 2 form of certain monosyllabic
independent nouns, e.g. i ̃́ ʼ gù ‘in the house’ from i ̃́ ‘building’ and /-gu̽/ (rather than igù
̃́ , although
the latter form is also acceptable). This highly plausible hypothesis allows to compare today’s suffix
/-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ with the second syllable of ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá, to which the word’s glottal stop must
have belonged originally, since the demonstrative roots /ngē-/ and /ye̊-/ do not, for their part,
include a glottal stop in their lexical forms.
2192463. The nominal phrase
The corresponding pre-hodiernal past form ye̊ʼwa̰ is only attested in elicited data.
The distribution of ngēʼwa̋kà/ye̊ʼwa̋kà vs ngēʼwa̰/ye̊ʼwa̰ is unclear.
The second syllable of ngēʼwa̋kà/ye̊ʼwa̋kà and ngēʼwa̰/ye̊ʼwa̰ might be cognate
with the locative relational noun /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’.220
(iv) Ngē-/ye̊- discourse connectors.
At least four discourse connectors appear to be derived, diachronically, from the non-salientive forms of the medial or
distal non-locative demonstrative roots.
The very frequent discourse connector ngērü/́ ye̊rǘ typically translates to English ‘because’, although it may also mean ‘[not ...] but [instead ...]’ in specific
cases where it introduces a positive clause that serves as a correction of an immediately preceding negative clause (see Section 7.8). For occurrences of the default
form ngērǘ (under its more typical unstressed form ērǘ; see below), see example
(207) and (T18) and (T134), among many others. For occurrences of the specifically pre-hodiernal past form ye̊rǘ, see (T34) and (T44).
The frequent word ngēka̰ (or ēka̰; see below) may be used as a conjunction
that loosely coordinates two clauses. It then virtually always occurs under the
abridged and invariable form ka̰ and can be translated as ‘and, and then’, as in
example (182). It often involves a subtle contrast between the two clauses it coordinates, as in (208). Ngēka̰ may additionally be used as a conjunction that introduces
semantically vague adverbial clauses. It can then be roughly translated as ‘so that
...’ or ‘while ...’, as in (199), (T58), or (T106). For more on this construction, see
Section 5.2.6, p.424. The pre-hodiernal past form ye̊ka̰ corresponding to ngēka̰ is
only attested in elicited data. The second syllable of ngēka̰/ye̊ka̰ might be cognate
with the relational noun /-ʼka̰/ ‘cause’.221
Today’s suffix /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’ probably used to have a pre-syllabic coda glottal stop, displaying a
form */- ʼ wa̋/. This pre-syllabic glottal stop is exceptionally retained in the locative 2 form of certain
monosyllabic independent nouns, e.g. i ̃́ ʼ wa̋ ‘to the house’ from i ̃́ ‘building’ and /-wa̋/ (besides
the—equally attested—expected form iwa̋
̃́ ). This highly plausible hypothesis allows to compare
today’s suffix /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’ with the second syllable of ngēʼwa̋kà/ye̊ʼwa̋kà and ngēʼwa̰/ye̊ʼwa̰, which
is the syllable to which these two words’ glottal stops must have belonged originally, since the
demonstrative roots /ngē-/ and /ye̊-/ do not, for their part, include a glottal stop in their lexical
forms.
220Possibly problematic for this hypothesis, however, is the fact that *ngē ʼ ka̰/ye̊ ʼ ka̰, with a glottal
stop, might then have been expected instead of ngēka̰/ye̊ka̰, since /- ʼ ka̰/ ‘cause’ features a glottal
stop.
2212483.4. Non-locative demonstratives
The discourse connector ngēnèka̋tǘ (or ēnèka̋tǘ; see below) is only attested once
in my corpus of spontaneous speech, in example (221), where it occurs under its
unstressed form ēnèka̋tǘ. It seems to be roughly translatable as ‘or even better’.
Its pre-hodiernal past form ye̊néka̋tǘ is only attested in elicited data.

Ngēwa̋ ‘according to it (?)’ (or ēwa̋ ; see below) is equally attested only once
in my corpus, in example (222), where it occurs under its unstressed form ēwa̋.
Its meaning is unclear and its analysis as a discourse connector is tentative and
provisional. Its pre-hodiernal past form ye̊wa̋ is only attested in elicited data.

It’s second syllable is likely cognate with that of the discourse connector ngi ̂wa̋
̂ a̋ (m/n/ns)/tüw
̂ a̋ (s) ‘well, as for it’, and possibly with the locative rela(f)/nüw
tional noun /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’.222
These four discourse connectors, although they may be realized as stressed
words, are virtually always left unstressed in spontaneous speech. As a consequence, the first syllable of their ngē- form is typically realized /ē-/, i.e. without
an initial velar nasal, yielding forms that are better transcribed as ērü,́ ēka̰ (or even
Note that the hypothesis put forward in note 220 (according to which /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’
may have formerly featured a pre-syllabic coda glottal stop, displaying the lexical form
*/- ʼ wa̋/), makes the hypothesis that the second syllable of ngēwa̋ (and, simultaneously, that of
̂ a̋/tüw
̂ a̋ ‘well’) might be cognate with /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’ relatively problematic, since *ngē ʼ wa̋
ngi ̂wa̋/nüw

de-stressing stressed words, see Section 2.5.1, p.121).
The conjunction ēgá (also /gá=/) ‘if’ can be realized as ngēgá and may therefore have been formerly another ngē-/ye̊- word. A hypothetical corresponding prehodiernal past form *ye̊gá is not attested in my data, however, and was explicitly
rejected in elicitation. The enclitic /=ēkà/, which generally expresses unsureness
of the speaker and is mostly employed in direct questions to make them more insistent, might also be a former ngē-/ye̊- word. Against this hypothesis, however,
are the fact that it does not seem to be realizable as *ngēkà and that a hypothetical
corresponding pre-hodiernal past form *ye̊kà is unattested in my data.","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255]"
"5.7.1Indexes for benefactive-malefactive and
accusative participants (slots 1–2)The benefactive(-malefactive) and accusative indexes in slots 1 and 2 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase (see Table 39, p.393) stand pronominally for participants which, if they were expressed as full NPs, would bear
the benefactive and accusative case-marking suffixes /-(ã)̀ ʼü̃̋/ and /-ʼü̃̄/, respectively. Compare, for instance, example (506), where the participant referring
to the recipient of a payment, being expressed as a NP, receives the benefactive
suffix /-ʼü̃̋/ (/maestro-ʼü̃̋/ [expert-ben] ‘to a professional’), with (507), where the
recipient participant is encoded as a mere pronominal index procliticized to the
predicative phrase (/cha̋=/ ‘1sg.ben’):

Restoring an independent pronoun instead of a benefactive or accusative index
may occur as a strategy allowing for the insertion of an enclitic (especially
one that typically behaves as a second-position clitic) between the pronoun and
the predicative phrase. In the following example, the future enclitic /=tá/, which
usually behaves as a second-position clitic, is inserted right after the expression of a
second person singular accusative participant by means of an independent pronoun
(/kû-ʼü̃̄/ ‘2sg-acc’), and in front of the predicative phrase:
(509)̆ güʼ̋ ü!”

However, the restoration of an independent pronoun is not obligatory for enclitic insertion, and in practice remains infrequent (although it might have been
obligatory at a former stage of the language when independent pronouns in the
benefactive and the accusative were just starting to evolve into proclitics). Contrast example (509) above, where /=tá/ ‘fut’ intervenes between the expression
of the accusative participant and the predicative phrase, with the following example, where the same enclitic comes after the whole predicative phrase regardless of
the fact that the latter bears an accusative index (/nǖ=/ ‘3m/n/ns.acc’):

Using an independent pronoun in the accusative instead of an accusative index
seems to be obligatory in a single context, specifically when the corresponding
participant is a complement of the deictic verb. This morphologically irregular
verb is never procliticized with the accusative indexes (see Section 6.2.1). Thus,
the third person salientive independent pronoun in the accusative (/tü̂-ʼü̃̄/ ‘3s-acc’)
in the following example cannot be replaced by its corresponding index (a form
such as */tǖ=ñâ-ʼü̃́/ [3s.acc=do.thus.3m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv-sub] for ‘he told him’ is
unattested in my data and in all likelihood ungrammatical):

him: [...]’ [jsg 134–135]
In cases where both a benefactive participant and an accusative participant
are to be referred to pronominally within the same clause, only the accusative
one may be encoded as an index procliticized to the predicative phrase. The benefactive one is then obligatorily expressed as an independent pronoun (for instances
of this situation, see examples (153), (T69), and (T70)). In other words, slots 1 and
2 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase cannot be filled simultaneously. I treat them as separate slots, instead of considering that they belong to
a single paradigm of which only one element can be present within a given inflected
predicative phrase, because the benefactive and accusative series of indexes are not
interchangeable in the situation just discussed. That is, when both a benefactive
and an accusative participants are referred to pronominally within a single clause,
it is not possible to express first the accusative one as an independent pronoun and
next the benefactive one as an index. Benefactive and accusative pronominal markers have to occur in this order, with the consequence that only the benefactive one,
being more peripheral than the accusative one relative to the predicative phrase,
can be “expelled” out of the inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase when
needed.
The first person singular benefactive and accusative indexes display two interspeaker variants each, specifically /cha̋=∼chő=/ (ben) and /chā=∼chō=/
(acc). The /a/-variants /cha̋=/ and /chā=/ are logically (given the origin of the
benefactive and accusative indexes as phonological reductions of the independent
4575. Inflection of the predicative phrase
pronouns in the benefactive and the accusative) used by those speakers who use the
/a/-variant of the first person singular pronominal root in cases where it bears the
benefactive or accusative suffixes (/châ-ʼü̋̃/ ‘1sg-ben’, /châ-ʼǖ̃/ ‘1sg-acc’). Conversely, the /o/-variants /chő=/ and /chō=/ are used by those speakers who use
the /o/-variant of the first person singular pronominal root in combination with the
benefactive or accusative suffixes (/chô-ʼü̋̃/ ‘1sg-ben’, /chô-ʼǖ̃/ ‘1sg-acc’). On the
/a/ and /o/ variants of the first person singular pronominal root in combination
with the benefactive and accusative suffixes, see Section 3.3.4.
Note that morphological sequences involving an accusative index followed by
the areal locative index /i ̋=/ (on which see next section) are occasionally realized by some speakers exactly like the benefactive index in the corresponding
person, which can prove confusing to the analyst. Thus, the morphemes /kű=/
and /tü̋=/, in examples (512) and (513) respectively, do not encode a second person singular benefactive and a third person salientive benefactive participants (although they are homonymous with the corresponding benefactive indexes /kű=/
‘2sg.ben’ and /tü̋=/ ‘3s.ben’), but the sequence of a second person singular accusative and a third person salientive accusative participants followed by the areal
locative index /i ̋=/:

partitive object participants (slot 3)Third person participants with a locative syntactic function may be indexed
on the predicative phrase by means of the proclitics /i ̋=/ (areal locative participant), /ne̋=/nű=/ (areal locative participant corresponding to the source of a
centripetal motion), and /i ̀=/ (punctual locative participant?) in slot 3 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase. These morphemes are discussed in
Section 5.7.2.1.
The encoding of third person (core) object participants that are only partitively affected by the process denoted by a transitive predicative phrase involve,
under certain conditions, the use of the proclitics /tà=/ (masculine partitive object), /ne̋=(/nű=?)/ (neuter partitive object), and /nè=/ (non-salientive partitive
object) in what I hypothesize to be the same morphosyntactic slot. These morphemes are the topic of Section 5.7.2.2.
The reasons why I tentatively analyze these two subsystems of locative participant indexation and partitive object participant indexation as belonging to the same
morphosyntactic slot are because 1) they never co-occur within the same inflected
predicative phrase in my data (negative evidence) and 2) they appear to share
one morpheme, specifically /ne̋=/ (and possibly its subdialectal variant /nű=/),
which is featured in both subsystems although with different functions (positive
but uncertain evidence). This question could probably be easily settled by further
research.","[459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464]"

"7.3Non-clausal negation (negative existential
indefinites)If a clause in the positive polarity contains existential300 indefinites (comparable to English ‘something, somewhere, etc.’) that precede the main predicative phrase, then the standard negator tãů ‘neg’ (on standard negation, see Section 7.2.1 above) is not normally used to negate it. That clause’s existential indefinites are replaced by corresponding negative existential indefinites instead (comparable to English ‘nothing, nowhere, etc.’).301
One part of these negative existential indefinites is productively derived as subject participant relativizations including the negative existential verb root
tåʼu ‘be absent’ (on tåʼu ‘be absent’, see Section 7.2.2 above). Due to their nature
of relativizations, these inflect for nominal class. Their basic forms are listed in
The form timbu stands for local Sp. timbo ‘plastic barrel’. The Spanish word’s phonological form
is slightly adapted when inserted in a smat utterance by code-mixing (see Section 2.7.2.2).
299Indefinites with semantic values other than existential (e.g. specific or universal indefinites)
do not have negative counterparts and do not display the behavior described in this section under
the scope of negation. See example (602) above for a case of negative clause featuring a (positive)
indefinite with a universal meaning (‘just any …’).
300I do not have enough data to explore what happens in cases where within a single clause
there might be a conflict on whether an existential indefinite or the main verb should be the locus
for negative polarity, i.e. cases where an existential indefinite is involved in existential, topicallocational, or privative negation (on these contexts of negation, see Sections 7.2.2–7.2.3), with
meanings such as ‘Wheat never existed in this region.’ or ‘I don’t have anything.’.

tåʼu ‘be absent’ may receive its own morphology (in this case, the intensifier suffix
/-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’) to productively contribute more complex forms of negative
existential indefinites).
The following examples illustrate typical uses of these negative existential indefinites:

because I have a knee injury.’ [igv 626]
Tåʼúgù (∼tågù), rather than meaning ‘never’, occasionally appears to merely
̊ ‘neg’
function as a more emphatic alternative for the standard negator tãu
(on which see Section 7.2.1), as in the following example:
(630)Tåʼúgù chā-chíbǜ i ̀ chòmà.

If several existential indefinites co-occur within a single clause, then only the
first one is negative, while the next ones remain as they would be in the corresponding positive clause. This is illustrated in the following example:
(631)Tåʼúgù mā g̃èʼta̋ nà-ũʼ̂ ü̃́ […].
tåʼú-gù=māg̃èʼta̋be.absent\sbjv?-ploc=precisely where?.alocnà=ũ-̂ ʼü̃́3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=go.sg\sbjv-sub‘He would never go anywhere [...].’ [amb 39]
In other words and more generally, negative polarity is only marked once
within a given clause, and more specifically on the first available locus. This
rule equally applies across different types of negation strategies in cases where
they could in principle co-occur, e.g. when topical-locational negation (on topicallocational negation, see Section 7.2.2) and an existential indefinite post-posed to
it co-occur within the same clause, as in the following example:

Two negative words do occasionally co-occur within a single clause, but with
the consequence that their negative values cancel each other, as in the following
example:

proclitic variant /mā=/). Thus:
– /=tàa/̃̄ co-occurring with negative polarity within a clause yields the meaning ‘(not) yet’ (lit. ‘It is still the case that [clause.in.the.negative.polarity]’), as shown in examples (634–636);
– mārǖ (or /mā=/) co-occurring with negative polarity within a clause
yields the meaning ‘(no) longer’ (lit. ‘It has now become the case that
[clause.in.the.negative.polarity]’), as shown in (637–638).305

In clauses involving negative polarity, just like in positive clauses, mārǖ ‘prf’
can appear in different positions. When it comes before the inflected predicative
phrase, it often immediately precedes tãů ‘neg’, as in (637), or the negative indefinite words; but it may also immediately follow them, as in (638). It may as well
immediately follow the inflected predicative phrase, as in the following example:

5337.5. Emphasizing negation
almost fully grammaticalized as a marker systematically co-occurring with negation
(except in cases of privative negation with /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’), with no emphasis effect
implied. The co-occurrence of /=mā/ with negation is by no means systematic in
smat, but its meaning is in many cases bleached in this context.
A rarer but stronger construction used for reinforcing negation can be syntactically interpreted as negation focus (‘It is not the case that …’). In this construction,
the non predicative negative word in a clause (i.e. tãů ‘neg’ or a negative existential indefinite) appears in the regular position of focalized constituents (focalized.
constituent inflected.copula (lk=)clause.in.sbjv-sub; on focalization, see
Section 5.2.6, p.426). From a pragmatic perspective, this construction is often
used when contradiction of a previous statement, an assumption, or a wish is
implied (‘[Contrary to what I/you/they said/believed/want,] negative.clause’).
This construction is illustrated in the following examples:
(642)̃́
“[…] tãů chírḛ níì-ĩ ̊ kūchà-ǘa̋ʼü!”
̊ =chírḛ níì=ĩ ̊
tãu

believe: a mother-in-law talks to her daughter-in-law after berating her
and then realizing she had been mistaken]!”’ [jsg B277]
(643)“Na̋ <tãů tá…> tågù tá níì-ĩ ̊ ì nâpàtǘwa̋ kù-ũʼ̂ ü̃́ […]?”

like you to go there] […]?”’ [jgs 730–731]
Note that the intensifier suffix /-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’ only has scope over the word
it is part of. As such, /-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’ cannot serve to emphasize negation,
which normally has scope over it, as in example (603) above, unless it occurs on
the negative word itself, as in (617) and (641) above.308
I have no simple explanation for why in the following examples /-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’, while it is
suffixed to the negative words themselves, does not intensify negation as expected, but rather seems
3085357. Negation
On the occasional use of the negative existential indefinite tåʼúgù (∼tågù) ‘never’
as an emphasized alternative for the standard negator tãů ‘neg’, see Section 7.3
above.","[535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541]"
"However, in the speech of most speakers, sbjv-ʼü̃́ is regularly used in declarative main clauses to present a process as constituting a new, salient step within
a temporal sequence of processes. sbjv-ʼü̃́ is then resorted to as a discursive device that allows the speaker to explicitly construct a clear temporal axis along which
major steps are grammatically signaled as such as they are being mentioned. Such
uses of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses could be roughly glossed by ‘at that
point, …’, as was done in the translation of example (448d) above. By contrast,
non-sequential processes, or minor sequential processes that the speaker does
not want to present as sequenced, are referred to with predicative phrases in ind.
In other words, predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ essentially correspond to those that
involve what I call advancement of narrative time ([+ant]), while predicative phrases in ind essentially correspond to those that do not involve advancement of narrative time ([-ant]). An important consequence is that predicative
phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses may not be uttered in a different
order without typically implying a different sequence for the processes referred to,
i.e. the ordering of [+ant] forms conditions the semantic interpretation of the
processes referred to. By contrast, predicative phrases in ind in declarative main
clauses may be uttered in a different order with no direct implication as to the sequence of the processes referred to, i.e. the ordering of [-ant] forms has no effect
on the semantic interpretation of the processes referred to. Note that the ordering of [-ant] forms does, by contrast, condition the discursive—more specifically,
the rhetorical—interpretation of utterances, as it obviously has direct effects on
the order in which the information is delivered and construed and the way it is
rhetorically organized.259Thus in example (451) below, which contains three main clauses in ind, the enacted speaker
chooses to first make a more generic announcement (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) and then proceeds to make a more specific elaboration on it in the next two utterances (‘I’ll shoot some brown
woolly monkeys. I’ll go woolly-monkey-hunting.’). With the exact same semantic meaning, the
first utterance (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) could presumably have been uttered last, but then that
semantically more generic utterance would have been construed as a summary restatement of the
more specific announcement made in the previous two utterances, yielding a different rhetorical
structure from the one actually at play in (451). Likewise, in (450) below, the ordering of the three
clauses in ind in the answer (‘I’ve shot a beautiful tére̋ parrot, it has fallen down here but I can’t
find it.’) could in principle be altered (as in e.g. ‘A beautiful tére̋ parrot has fallen down here, but
I can’t find it, [in fact] I’ve shot it.’) with no consequences as to their semantic interpretation, but
2594005.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
Typical discourse genres where the ind vs sbjv-ʼü̃́ contrast is exploited are
narratives (whether set in a remote past and unrelated to the discourse participants—myths, legends, tales, etc.—or set in a relatively recent past and related to
the discourse participants—life stories, anecdotes, etc.) and procedural discourse
(cooking recipes, descriptions of craft techniques, chronologically-ordered descriptions of the typical activities carried out in a given period of time, etc.). In these
discourse genres, while predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ are used to orderly unroll the
series of major events (or steps to be conducted), predicative phrases in ind are generally employed with one or several of the following six main discursive functions
(the simple illustrative contexts of use in parentheses are made up examples that
parallel actual occurrences in my corpus; actual examples are provided below):260
– locating a major event in space or time (e.g. ‘The next day came.ind. Then
he went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ into the jungle.’);
– mentioning preliminary minor events (e.g. ‘He eventually spotted.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a
monkey. He came closer.ind and he shot.sbjv-ʼü̃́ it.’);
– recapitulating a previous major event (e.g. ‘And then he came down.sbjv-ʼü̃́.
So, he came down.ind, and then he started.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to speak.’);261
such alterations would affect the rhetorical relations that bind them into a small discourse unit.
In practice, in (450), the rhetorical principle that guides the ordering of the clauses in ind under
scrutiny is temporal iconicity, but the use of ind in these clauses indicates that establishing a clear
temporal axis is not essential to the purposes of the enacted speaker at that moment.
Interestingly, when they fulfill one of the first three functions in this list, main declarative
clauses containing a predicative phrase in ind are often explicitly topicalized by means of a topic
marker (/=i ̀/ ‘contr.top’ in non-past contexts or /=gá/ ‘pst’ in past contexts) attached at their
right edge (as in examples (454a) and (455e) below). This clause-level topicalization process could
in fact be argued to turn these clauses into near-dependent clauses (as opposed to genuinely independent main clauses). Note further that all of the six functions in this list are somehow related to
topical (i.e. already known or backgrounded) information, as opposed to the more focal (i.e. unknown or foregrounded) information typically conveyed by declarative main clauses containing a
predicative phrase in sbjv-ʼü̃́.
260The use of such recapitulating clauses for discourse cohesion is frequent in narratives and procedural discourse in smat. These recapitulating clauses are of two major formal and functional types.
Some include the predicative phrase of the recapitulated clause more or less verbatim (“recapitulating linkage” proper in Aikhenvald (2019)’s terminology). These verbatim (or specific) recapitulating
clauses typically provide linkage from one sentence to the next within a single paragraph and often
imply that the two main processes referred to are temporally close to each other (see e.g. examples (454a–454b) below). Other much more formulaic recapitulating clauses feature an anaphoric
word referring to the processes to be recapitulated (/ngē-mà/ ‘med.ns-anaph’ in past or non-past
2614015. Inflection of the predicative phrase
– initiating a series of major events (e.g. ‘Once upon a time, a man went.ind
into the jungle. There he found.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a deer.’);
– elaborating on specific aspects of a major event occurring at the same reference time (e.g. ‘And then they had.sbjv-ʼü̃́ dinner. They chatted.ind, they
drank.ind [i.e. while eating]. Then they went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to bed.);
– describing participants of a major event (e.g. ‘The canoe was large.ind.’).","[405, 406, 407]"

clause without affecting in any way its morphosyntactic structure, can be used in a
large variety of contexts. In particular, tãů ‘neg’ occurs:
– with most types of predicative phrases, whether verbal (as in examples (601–

– in both main clauses (as in (601), (603–606), and (609)) and subordinate
clauses (as in (607–608));
– with both the Indicative Inflectional Type (as in (602) and (604–606)) and
the Subjunctive (and Subjunctive + /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’) Inflectional Type (as in (601),
(603), and (607–610));
– and in declarative utterances (as in (601) and (603–606)), interrogative utterances (as in (609)), and exclamative utterances (as in (606)).

– in association with the Imperative Inflectional Type (7.7).
Tãů ‘neg’, a phonologically anomalous word in that its only syllable combines
an oral onset together with a nasal nucleus, is likely to have arisen etymologically
from a phonetic reduction of /tåʼú-ʼü̃́/ ‘be.absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ (lit. ‘(a/the)
non-existing’), i.e. the regular subject participant relativization in the non-salientive nominal class of the negative existential verb tåʼu ‘be absent’. /Tåʼú-ʼǘ̃/ ‘be.
absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ is in fact still used in its unreduced form to express meanings
such as ‘no X, none, nothing, nobody’ (see Section 7.3 below). It is unclear, however, through what kind of grammaticalization path a relativization like /tåʼú-ʼǘ̃/
‘be.absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ may have ended up functioning as the most general negative marker in smat.","[522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527]"

syllables with a labialized velar onset.
As shown in Table 9, the only systematic exception to this pattern of syllabic
harmony for surface nasality is the sequence [ŋV[–nasal] ] occurring in stressed
syllables. The following examples exhibit a [ŋ] occurring both—unsurprisingly—
in a nasal syllable (44b) and—unexpectedly—in a non-nasal syllable (44a):
(44)a. /oMC /b. /∼oMC/[ŋo̞o̰]̞[ŋõ̞o]̰̞̃‘be visible’‘to bite’This exception is not surprising if one analyzes this sequence underlyingly as /V/
and considers that its [ŋ] emerges secondarily as a default surface consonant onset
that fills its underlying lack of consonant onset (see end of Section 2.1.1).
Note also that the phoneme /ʔ/, whether in onset or coda position, is realized the same (i.e. as [ʔ]) in phonologically non-nasal and nasal syllables, as
shown in the following two examples:
(45)a. /ʔa22 /b. /∼ʔa22 /[ʔa22 ][ʔã22 ]‘to sing’‘mosquito’Because a glottal stop is, for articulatory reasons, unspecified for nasality, the fact

ture of the syllable it belongs to is unsurprising and does not constitute an exception
to the general pattern of obligatory harmony for surface nasality.
Possibly the only genuinely irregular exception to the pattern of syllabic harmony for surface nasality in the language occurs in the particle used for standard negation, which is typically realized as [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ]30 (on the standard negative particle, see Section 7.2.1). The anomalous co-occurrence of a non-nasal
segment [t ̪] with a nasal diphthong [ã͡ʊ̃] within a single syllable in this highfrequency morpheme clearly results from its historical origin as a phonological reduction of /ta34 ʔu4 ∼ʔɯ4 / [ˈt ̪aː34 ʔu4 ʔɯ̃ 4 ] ‘nothing’ (this non-reduced form still exists
in the language, but exclusively with a function of negative existential indefinite,
i.e. not that of standard negator; see Section 7.3). The phonological nasality of
the last syllable of the original form /ta34 ʔu4 ∼ʔɯ4 / has been retained in today’s
phonologically-reduced monosyllabic form [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ34
̃ ], giving rise to an anomalous
case of a nasality-wise disharmonic syllable. Interestingly, certain speakers tend to
denasalize
[(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ] (whose exact phonological representation is unclear under the analysis
of nasality put forward in this section) to [(ˈ)t ̪a͡ʊ34 ], a phonologically unsurprising
reaction that results in the regularization of the phonetic and phonological forms of
the standard negator ([(ˈ)t ̪a͡ʊ34 ], by contrast with [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ], can be straightforwardly
represented phonologically as /tau34 / under the analysis of nasality put forward in
this section).
While all other segmental phonemes may occur in nasal syllables, the velar consonant phonemes /k/ and /g/ do not occur in nasal syllables.
The presence or absence of nasality in a given syllable is entirely determined
by the lexicon; there does not exist a single phonological or morphological process
in the language that ever affects this feature so as to turn a nasal syllable into a nonnasal one or vice versa.
Note that due to this, there is no language-internal way to tell whether it is a
[–voice] consonant phoneme (e.g. a /p/) or a [+voice] consonant phoneme (e.g.
a /b/) that underlies a given nasal consonant on the surface (e.g. an [m]). In
other words, there is no language-internal way to decide whether a syllable such as
Note, incidentally, that the surface nasality that occurs in the first syllable of the more conservative variant [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ʔɯ̃ 4 ] of the standard negative particle is unproblematic as it can be accounted for as a case of anticipatory nasality spreading (on this purely phonetic phenomenon, see
Section 2.1.2, p.73).

speaking, one thus has to consider that the [±voice] feature of onset consonant
phonemes, while contrastive in non-nasal syllables, is neutralized in nasal
syllables, according to the pattern shown in Table 10. Consequently, the phoneme
underlying a nasal consonant on the surface is to be viewed as an archiphoneme
specified for place of articulation but unspecified for voicing.
In this section, I have transcribed the archiphonemes underlying nasal consonants on the surface with uppercase letters representing—arbitrarily—the [+voice]
member of the pair of phonemes corresponding to each place of articulation (e.g.
/B/ for the neutralization of /p/ and /b/, i.e. for a bilabial consonant phoneme
unspecified for voice; see examples (40c), (41c), (42c), and (43c) above). For simplicity’s sake, however, in the remainder of this study the phonemes underlying
nasal consonants on the surface are transcribed as though they were the [+voice]
member of the pair of phonemes corresponding to each place of articulation (e.g.
/b/ in nasal syllables stands for /B/). This practical decision is illustrated in example (46). It should not obliterate the cross-linguistically unusual situation displayed
by smat whereby the contrastive voicing feature of consonants becomes neutral-892.4. Toneme inventory

major phonetic exponent of 8 of these tonemic values is a pitch pattern, while that
of the last 2 is a phonation pattern (on phonation patterns as “tonemes”, see below).
The toneme inventory in stressed syllables is exemplified in detail in Section 2.4.1.
Two alternative analyses of the toneme inventory in stressed syllables, which
would have resulted in a reduction of that inventory to less than 10 underlying
units, are considered but argued against in Section 2.4.2.
Unstressed syllables feature one of only 6 different tonemic values. Again,
the major phonetic exponent of 5 of these tonemic values is a pitch pattern, while
that of the last one is a phonation pattern. The toneme inventory in stressed syllables is discussed in detail in Section 2.4.3. Note, incidentally, that two of the
tonemic values found in unstressed syllables (/4/1 / and /C /) in fact only occur in
post-tonic syllables, and not in pre-tonic syllables (on syllabic structure, see Section 2.5). However, because the remaining four tonemic values of unstressed syllables are phonologically and phonetically identical in pre- and post-tonic syllables,
these two syllable types are dealt with together as far as their tonological properties
912. Phonetics and phonology
are concerned.
The phonetic realization of all the tonemes identified in Sections 2.4.1 and
2.4.3 is briefly illustrated on concrete samples in Section 2.4.4.
smat’s unusually rich toneme inventory, together with its maximal “syntagmatic toneme density” (i.e. the fact that all of its underlying syllables are tonologically specified), is assessed from a cross-linguistic and an areal perspective in
Sections 2.4.5 and 2.4.6 respectively.
Relatively complex morphosyntactically-conditioned processes of tonological alternations, which may secondarily affect a syllable’s lexical toneme, are
discussed in Section 2.6.2 further below.
Note, importantly, that I indiscriminately call “tonemes” suprasegmental
phonological items whose major phonetic exponent is a tone (tonemes proper,
with pitch-related contrastive properties) and suprasegmental phonological items
whose major phonetic exponent is a phonation pattern (which could be called
“phonationemes”, with phonation-related contrastive properties). For instance, I
call “tonemes” both a phonological item typically realized as a pitch contour starting from the tonal height [5 ] and falling to the tonal height [2 ] (i.e. toneme /52 /, as
in example (47a)) and a phonological item typically realized as a phonation contour starting with modal voice and ending with creaky voice (i.e. “toneme” /MC /,
as in (47b)).
(47)a. /wi 52 /b. /guMC/[wi 52 ]
[guṵ]‘to cut’‘to finish’The reason why I treat both types of phonological items identically, although
they exhibit heterogeneous phonetic exponents, is because they do not constitute
two orthogonal features but belong instead within a single functionally-homogeneous phonological paradigm in smat. Pitch has no phonological relevance
in syllables that involve creaky voice phonation; no pair of such syllables consistently contrast for pitch properties under any conditions.32 Conversely, phonation
is but marginally relevant—only to the extent that it is not creaky-voiced—in syllables where pitch is the foreground contrastive feature; in these syllables, phonation
In practice, modal-voiced portions of syllables featuring creaky voice are typically realized with
a pitch approximately corresponding to the tonal height that I transcribe as [2 ], but this is not always
the case.

is regularly modal. In other words, the phonological items that involve creaky
voice phonation (i.e. /CM /, /MC /, and /C /; see below) and those that rely on pitchrelated exponents (the tonemes proper) stand in absolute complementary distribution. Since the phonational-tonological paradigm they constitute features more
tonemes proper (8 in stressed syllables, 5 in unstressed syllables) than “phonationemes” (2 in stressed syllables, 1 in unstressed syllables), I have opted for designating both types after the usual term for the former.
On surface phenomena involving stiff voice and breathy voice phonation, see
Section 2.1.1 on the realization of /ʔ/ and end of Section 2.1.2 respectively.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]"

in nominal class with its contextually implied referent, di ̄ẽr̄ ù ‘money’, a noun that
usually triggers agreement in the salientive (s) nominal class:

A second group of negative existential indefinites exists, which can be interpreted as partially lexicalized forms replacing tåʼúʼü̃́ in cases where it has a
very general meaning ‘nothing’. This group of negative existential indefinites is
morphologically built as combinations of /tåʼú-/ ‘nothing’303 with a case suffix or a
relational noun. The ones attested in my data are listed in Table 51 (but note that
there is likely to be a few more than these, with other case suffixes or relational
nouns).304
By contrast to the previously discussed negative existential indefinites, which
can function as modifiers or modified heads, these /tåʼú/-based negative existential
indefinites always constitute entire arguments on their own, i.e. they may not
modify, nor be modified by, any other word. The following example illustrates
the ordinary use of one of them, /tåʼú-ʼǖ̃/ ‘be.absent\sbjv?-acc’:
This morpheme /tåʼú-/ ‘nothing’ probably comes from a former zero-derived nominalization of
the verb tåʼu ‘be absent’. Note, however, that by this etymological interpretation /tåʼú-/’s current
shape would appear to be tonologically slightly irregular, and one would have expected a form
*/tåʼu-/ (i.e. a form *[ˈt ̞aː34 ʔu 3 ...], featuring a tone [3 ], not [4 ], on its second surface syllable)
instead.
303Anderson & Anderson (2016:218-219) also register the related forms tax2 u2 ma3 ‘nothing’ (i.e.
/tåʼú=mā/ ‘nothing=precisely’ in my analysis), tax2 u2 cax5 ma3 ‘for nothing’ (i.e. /tåʼú-ka̰=mā/
‘nothing-cause=precisely’) and tax2 u2 cü2 rü2 wa1 ‘cannot’ (i.e. /tåʼú-kǘrǘwa̋/ ‘nothing-since?’) in
the Cushillococha Tikuna variety. These, and possibly more, might also exist in the smat variety.

As shown in example (626), some of these /tåʼú-/-based negative existential indefinites have a regular, compositional meaning (see also e.g. /tåʼú-máʼa/ ‘be.absent\
sbjv?-com’ meaning ‘with nothing, without anything’, as would be expected). Others, by contrast, have grammaticalized with less straightforwardly predictable
meanings, as suggested in Table 51. Illustrations of the latter cases are provided
in (627–629). Note that tåʼúgù (which only seems to mean ‘never’, while the relational noun /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ it contains would have lead to predict it to also be able to
mean *‘nowhere’) features, as in (627), a free variant tågù (probably a phonological
reduction from tåʼúgù itself; on the origin of the variant tågù, see also Section 7.5
and note 307 below). Note also that tåʼúak̃̀ ǜ ‘cannot, may not’ (lit. ‘no way’) is
not only used in the expression of physical inability, as in (629), but also more
general impossibility (see e.g. (T117)).

distribution of the two irregular forms of /-ãr̀ ǖ/ in this context is essentially subdialectal (with e.g. lar using the form /-ʼrǖ/ and jsg using, optionally, the form

displayed in Table 29 in its three attested subdialectal variants.
The Allomorphs 4 of the first person singular, third person masculine/neuter/non-salientive, and fourth person pronominal roots feature two subdialectal variants each, characterized by either a vowel /o/ or a vowel /a/. Only
the /o/-variants are attested in combination with the variant /-ʼri ̄/ of the genitive

stress in stressed function words, see Section 2.5.1, p.121). In practice, the forms
in the other two columns in Table 29 are also frequently—but not always—left
unstressed. Only their stressed phonological forms are provided in this table.
Note, finally, that the form that functions as the Allomorph 4 of the third person salientive pronominal root (/tü̂-mà/) is, in practice, the third person salientive independent pronoun in the zero-case, i.e. a morphologically complex form
that includes the morpheme /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’ (see Section 3.3.3). This form does
not formally align, consequently, with the Allomorphs 4 of the other pronominal
roots, which are morphologically simplex forms. The independent pronouns in the
zero-case corresponding to other person-number-nominal class combinations than
the third person salientive cannot function as Allomorphs 4, i.e. cannot be attached
with the genitive suffix (e.g. */chò-mà-ãr̀ ǖ/ ‘1sg-anaph-gen’ is not a grammatical
alternative for e.g. /chô-ʼrǖ/ ‘my, mine’), while the genitive suffix is otherwise regularly attached to the zero-case form of non-pronominal NPs. This formal misalignment of the third person salientive pronominal root can be interpreted as showing
that it lacks, in fact, an Allomorph 4 proper. Its corresponding zero-case independent pronoun is used to fill this lack by analogy with ordinary NPs, which can,
in their zero-case form, be attached with the genitive suffix (for an exactly parallel discussion regarding the Allomorph 1 of the third person salientive pronominal
root, see Section 3.3.2 above).
2033. The nominal phrase
Combinations of the pronominal roots with the genitive suffix provide independent pronouns in the genitive, which encode pronominal possessors of NPs (by
contrast with pronominal possessors of bound nouns, on the encoding of which see
Section 3.3.2 above). This frequently occurring use of the independent pronouns
in the genitive is shown in the following example:
(141)“[...] chāyā-yâʼu yá kûʼrǖ ócha̋gù [...].”
chā=yā=yâʼuyá=kû-ʼrǖ ócha̋gù1sg.sbj=pci ̄.3m/n/ns.obj=seize lk.m/n/s=2sg-gen dart‘“[...] I’ve caught your dart [...].”’ [jsg B226]
Note that a NP possessed by an independent pronoun in the genitive is not necessarily definite, as shown in (142), or even specific (see also example (196)):
(142)[...] ērü.́ .. wíʼá nȍʼrǖ... cuñauʼü̃̄198 níì-ma̰.
ērǘwíʼá nȍ-ʼrǖ cuñau-ʼü̃̄níì=ma̰because indf 3m-gen brother.in.law-acc 3m/n/ns.sbj.pci ̀=kill.sg‘[...] because... he had killed one of his... brothers-in-law.’ [amb 15–16]
The independent pronouns in the genitive may also occur—although rarely—in
head position, i.e. without the NP they relate to, as in the following example:
(143)Ñùʼ ñâãk̀ ǜ tá-nů yá kûʼrǖ?
ñùʼñâãk̀ ǜtá=nůyá=kû-ʼrǖwhat.activity? in.this.manner 3s.sbj=put.pl lk.m/s=2sg-gen‘[Oh, it seems my cups are not in the same position as yours, while they
should.] How are yours put?’ [jca D80]3.3.6Aspects of the semantics of smat’s
pronominal systemIn most cases, first, second, and third person ordinarily correspond to speaker,
hearer, and any participant that is neither speaker nor hearer, respectively. Second
The form cuñau here stands for Sp. cuñado ‘brother-in-law’ (on the phonological reduction of the
Spanish syllable -ado when it is inserted into a smat utterance by code-mixing, see Section 2.7.2.2).
1982043.3. Pronouns
person singular morphemes, however, are occasionally used without reference to
the hearer. Example (144) illustrates the generic, non-referential human use of
the second person singular. This use is relatively frequent in discourse, although
it largely overlaps with the generic use of the fourth person (compare (155–156)
below).

[jgs 599–601]
In (145–146), a second person singular refers to precisely identifiable referents
distinct from the hearer. Such uses, by contrast with the generic use of the second
person singular just mentioned, are exceptional and highly marked pragmatically
or stylistically. The second person singular in (145) is used as the semantic equivalent of a first person plural, but invites particular attention on the part of the hearer
(the first sentence of the example could be essentially paraphrased as ‘nobody could
provide us with identity documents, you know!/can you believe that?’).
(145)[...] tèʼe̋ gá... kûʼrǖ pōpērà kű-yăʼűʼè...? Tā-g̃en̊ átǖē.

ear, with whom I transcribed and translated the recording from which this example was extracted, interpreted this utterance as meaning that the speaker was not able to attend school when
she was young because she had no official identity documents, which were needed for that purpose.
Back then, only men had enough practice of the non-indigenous society to know how to obtain such
documents, but because the speaker’s father was dead, she could not get ones in the first place.
1992053. The nominal phrase
[gra 160–161]
The second person singular in (146) is used as the semantic equivalent of a third
person (see also (345) and (T102)). This rare stylistic device seems to be specific
to narrative discourse and to indicate that the process being referred to is sudden
or unexpected.

The category I refer to as the first person plural is exclusive: it refers to a
group that is composed of the speaker and one or several third person participants,
but does not normally include the hearer. The enacted speakers in the following
example can therefore only refer to themselves as a first person plural when inviting
a man to follow them (i.e. the speakers to the explicit exclusion of the hearer) to
go fishing:200

E133]
What I label the fourth person corresponds either 1) to a well-defined inclusive
first person plural (i.e. referring to a group composed of both speaker and hearer,
and possibly one or several third person participants), 2) to a vaguely identified
but referential social group of which the speaker considers themselves as a
A different linguistic perspective on the exact same process could of course have allowed using
a fourth person in its first person plural inclusive meaning in example (600), as in e.g. Let’s go
(poison-fishing) together [you and us]!.

member but that does not necessarily include the hearer, or 3) to a generic, usually singular non-referential human participant (compare the English generic
pronoun one in e.g. One should respect one’s parents at all times).201 It is to underline
its broad semantic range that I have opted for calling this category of the language’s
persons system “fourth person”, instead of e.g. “first person plural inclusive”, which
would have been misleading.202
Examples (148–149) provide occurrences of a fourth person with a first person plural inclusive meaning (see also (T127–T128), which may be contrasted
with (T137–T138) where the exact same referents are referred to as a first person
plural (exclusive)). Note that the plural marking of fourth person participants (e.g.
by means of /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ suffixed to an intransitive verb with a fourth person subject
in (148)) is in most cases optional and does not relate to the actual number of individuals subsumed within such participants, which may be two, as in (148), or more
than two, as in (149).

PPs that predicate a relation of similarity between the subject referent and the

in English as ‘be similar to X, to look like X’. PPs formed by the suffix /-ràʼǜ̃/ are

(356) or, in younger speakers, in its reinterpretation as pcØ involving associated
motion as in (357) (on pcnà and its reanalysis in younger speakers, see Section 5.9,

"625C. Résumé en françaisChapitre 5 – Morphologie flexionnelle du syntagme
prédicatifCe chapitre décrit la morphologie flexionnelle du SP fini. La quasi-totalité des
morphèmes dont il est question ici sont des proclitiques qui sont directement préposés au SP. La seule exception à cette généralisation est un suffixe qui s’attache à
l’autre extrémité du SP. Bon nombre de ces morphèmes ont pour fonction d’indexer
des participants ayant des fonctions syntaxiques diverses : sujet, objet, participant
en fonction accusative (lequel se distingue de l’objet (nucléaire) au niveau morphosyntaxique et, dans une certaine mesure, au niveau sémantique), participant
bénéfactif(-maléfactif), participant locatif et participant objet partitif. D’autres
parmi ces proclitiques encodent la classe prédicative (ou « conjugaison », si l’on
veut) du SP auquel ils sont préposés. D’autres encore indiquent que le procès
s’accompagne d’un mouvement associé. Un certain nombre de ces morphèmes
sont des morphèmes fusionnels, qui accomplissent plusieurs de ces fonctions à la
fois. Ceux-ci contribuent à rendre jusqu’à un certain point fusionnelle la morphologie principalement agglutinante du tsma. Enfin, l’une des valeurs flexionnelles
encodées dans le SP – à savoir le tiroir verbal Subjonctif – compte parmi ses exposants un processus d’alternance tonologique. Sa réalisation morphologique est,
en d’autres termes, de nature partiellement suprasegmentale.
On remarquera que la morphologie flexionnelle du SP ne compte pas parmi ses
fonctions l’encodage explicite de valeurs de type temporel, aspectuel, modal ou
évidentiel (à l’exception, d’après l’analyse que je propose, d’une valeur d’aspect
progressif ; cf. Section 5.7.2.1, p.462). Ce type de valeurs grammaticales est pour
l’essentiel encodé au moyen de suffixes dérivationnels du SP (cf. Section 4.4)
ou bien d’enclitiques ou particules de portée propositionnelle, ou encore, pour ce
qui concerne la catégorie du temps spécifiquement, à l’intérieur des constituants
nominaux à travers l’utilisation de formes spécifiques de certaines classes de mots
qui se fléchissent en temps nominal.
Les deux exemples qui suivent illustrent une partie de ces remarques préliminaires concernant les propriétés formelles et fonctionnelles de la morphologie flexionnelle du SP en tsma :

L’exemple (6) montre un SP fléchi au tiroir verbal Indicatif. On peut considérer le
tiroir Indicatif comme non marqué d’un point de vue morphologique (par rapport
aux deux autres tiroirs verbaux de la langue, à savoir le tiroir Subjonctif et, dans une
moindre mesure, le tiroir Impératif). C’est là la raison pour laquelle la glose de cet
exemple ne mentionne pas la valeur Indicatif. Les proclitiques flexionnels représentés dans cet exemple – où ils forment une chaîne de morphèmes typiquement agglutinante – ont successivement pour fonction d’indexer un participant en fonction
accusative (/tǖ=/ ‘3s.acc’), d’indexer un argument sujet (/ná=/ ‘3m/n/ns.sbj’),
et d’encoder la classe prédicative (ou « conjugaison ») du SP (/rǖ=/ ‘pcrǖ’). Cette
dernière est en l’occurrence héritée par le SP /chó-ʼẽʼ́ e/ (se.trouver.pl-caus) ‘faire
être quelque part (un complément pluriel)’ de la classe prédicative lexicale de la
racine verbale chó ‘se trouver (un sujet pluriel)’ sur laquelle il est formé.
L’exemple (7) montre quant à lui un SP fléchi au tiroir verbal Subjonctif. La
flexion dans ce tiroir verbal se manifeste de manière suprasegmentale au niveau de
l’un des proclitiques (en l’occurrence, au niveau de l’indice de troisième personne
sujet /nà=/ ‘3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv’, dont le tonème /1 / peut s’interpréter comme un
exposant du tiroir Subjonctif) ainsi que, de façon générale, dans la dernière syllabe du SP lui-même (en l’occurrence, sur l’indice de troisième personne objet /-ã/̀‘3m/n/ns.obj’ – le seul élément de la morphologie flexionnelle du SP à être un
suffixe –, qui se trouve ne pas changer de tonème sous l’effet des alternances morphotonologiques qui affectent en temps normal la dernière syllabe des SP au tiroir
Subjonctif, d’où les parenthèses que comprend sa glose : ‘3m/n/ns.obj(\sbjv)’).
On notera que les traits grammaticaux dont l’exposant est de nature exclusivement
suprasegmentale sont précédés dans la ligne de glose d’une barre oblique inversée
<\>. Enfin, le proclitique flexionnel /yà=/ ‘am’ en (7) indique que le procès
principal (‘il le cueillit’) est précédé par un événement de mouvement associé (‘il
alla le cueillir’).","[630, 631, 632]"
"Table 47. Smat verb roots and verb stems with suppletive singular vs plural forms
/ǘ-kù/ (be.there.sg-in.pl) ‘to enter’ and /ṹ-ʼǜ̃/ (go.sg-out.pl) ‘to exit’, are irregular
inasmuch as they feature the plural allomorph of a figure-ground configuration suffix (instead of its singular allomorph, as expected; see paragraph (v) below). The
verb stem meaning ‘to return’ (sg. /ta̋-ègù/ ‘drop.sg-inv’, pl. /wò-ègù/ ‘drop.plinv’), for its part, can be considered to have, to a certain degree, non-compositional
semantics.
This strategy for number encoding is illustrated by the contrast between the
three pairs of examples (602–564), (565–566), and (567–568). The first pair of
examples shows that the distribution of the two allomorphs go̊ and yi ̀ of the intransitive verb meaning ‘to grow’ relies on whether the subject of this verb is singular,
as in (602), or plural, as in (564).

In (565–566), the same principle is shown to apply to the distribution of the allomorphs ta̰ and wò of the transitive verb meaning ‘to drop’. Note, however, that it
is now the number of the object argument (as opposed to the subject argument as
in the preceding two examples) that determines the use of the singular or plural
allomorph of the verb:

The fact that it is the number of the object argument, rather than that of the subject argument, that determines the selection of the singular or plural allomorph of
transitive verb roots inflecting for number is made even clearer by (567–568). In
(567), although the subject is explicitly marked as plural (by the presence of the
suffix /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ within the predicative phrase), the singular allomorph gå of the
verb meaning ‘to lead’ is selected in accordance with the singular number of the
4915. Inflection of the predicative phrase
object argument. Conversely, in (568), although the subject is explicitly singular
(as indicated by /chà=/ ‘1sg.sbj\sbjv’), the plural allomorph nâ of the same verb
is selected in accordance with the plural number of the object argument.

them there, to the ice-cream parlor.’ [jgs 101–102]
(iv) Addition of /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’. The plural (or collective) value of the number
feature of the subject argument of certain verbal intransitive predicative phrases
is regularly—although not entirely systematically—encoded through the addition
of the suffix /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ to these predicative phrases. It is unclear why certain
verbal intransitive predicative phrases may receive this suffix (e.g. pé ‘to sleep’,
tåʼu ‘to be absent’, or chi ́bǜ ‘to eat’), while others never do (e.g. ó ‘to disappear’,
déʼà ‘to speak’, or dău ‘to see’, the latter being an intransitive verb root that takes a
complement in the accusative), and still others display some inter-speaker variation
with respect to whether or not they may take this suffix (e.g. ngǜ ‘to rest’).
The verb pūrākǘ ‘to work’ belongs to the lexical class of predicative phrases that
regularly take /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ when their subject is plural (or collective). Contrast
example (569), where pūrākǘ is not suffixed with /-ē/ as its subject corresponds
referentially to a single man, with (570), where pūrākǘ is suffixed with /-ē/ as its
subject now corresponds to a group of men.

nge̋-màná=pūrākǘ-ēmed.aloc-anaph 3m/n/ns.sbj=work-intr.pl‘They work there [...].’ [jgs 477]
(v) Selection of figure-ground configuration suffix allomorph. The
singular vs plural (or collective) value of the number feature of the subject argument of most verbal intransitive predicative phrases that contain any of the
derivational suffixes encoding the figure-ground configurations ‘in’, ‘out’, and ‘off’,
and that of the object argument of most verbal transitive predicative phrases that
contain these same suffixes, is regularly—although not entirely systematically—
encoded through the selection of one or the other of the two suppletive forms of
these suffixes (e.g. /-ku̽chi ́/ ‘in.sg’ vs /-ku̽/ ‘in.pl’). On these suffixes, see Sections 4.2.3.1, 4.2.3.2, and 4.2.3.5.
This strategy for number encoding is illustrated by the contrast between examples (571) and (572) (the latter being repeated from (455b) above). These largely
parallel examples differ in the selection of the form of the figure-ground configuration suffix featured in their essentially synonymous main predicative phrases. In
(571), the singular allomorph /-ē/ of the figure-ground configuration suffix meaning ‘off’ is selected for, while it is its plural allomorph /-ǜ̃/ that is used in (572). Because the predicative phrases in question are transitive, the selection of /-ē/ ‘off.sg’
in (571) indicates that the object argument is singular (in this case, a mash), while
the selection of /-ǜ̃/ ‘off.pl’ in (572) indicates that the object argument is plural (in
this case, plantains).

peeled.’ [tvj 360–361]
Note, however, than in a few lexicalized predicative phrases, the plural allomorph of a figure-ground configuration suffix is used in practice with a singular value, as in the singular intransitive predicative phrases /ǘ-kù/ (be.there.sgin.pl) ‘to enter (sg.)’ and /ṹ-ʼǜ̃/ (go.sg-out.pl) ‘to exit (sg.)’, in particular.
(vi) Distributive suffix allomorph selection.
The non-plural (i.e. singular or collective) vs plural value of the number feature of the subject, object, or
accusative argument of predicative phrases that contain the derivational distributive suffix is regularly—although not entirely systematically—encoded through the
selection of one or the other of the two suppletive forms of this suffix (specifically
/-chi ̀gǜ/ ‘distr.sg’ vs /-ètānǜ/ ‘distr.pl’). In a clause that contains several arguments that could be specified by the plural form of the distributive suffix (e.g. both
the subject and object arguments of a transitive predicative phrase), which of them
is being specified by it as plural is left to context.
This strategy for number encoding in illustrated by the contrast between examples (573) and (574). These examples both feature a predicative phrase that
includes the plural form of the intransitive verb meaning ‘to go’ (i ̃̂). These predicative phrases necessarily have a non-singular (i.e. collective or plural) subject. The
one in (573) is suffixed with the non-plural form of the distributive suffix (/-chi ̀gǜ/),
which indicates that its subject (in this case, the jungle fauna) is to be viewed as a
collective entity rather than as a collection of individuals. In such a context, distributivity is accordingly interpreted as indicating that the process occurs little by
little or step by step.

[ano2 7:29–7:34]
By contrast, the predicative phrase containing i ̃̂ ‘to go (pl.)’ in (574) is suffixed with
the plural form of the distributive suffix (/-ètānǜ/), which indicates that its subject
(in this case, students) is to be viewed as a collection of individuals rather than as
a collective entity. In such a context, distributivity is accordingly interpreted as
indicating that each of these individuals is involved in a specific sub-occurrence of
the process (in this case, each individual student comes from a community that is
different from that of all or part of the other students).

(vii) Addition of /-gǘ/ ‘pl’. Finally, the plural value of the number feature of
either the subject, object, or accusative argument of apparently any predicative
phrase may be optionally made explicit by the addition of the suffix /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ to
that predicative phrase. In a clause that contains several arguments that could be
specified by /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ (e.g. both the subject and object arguments of a transitive

context. Note that this suffix, by contrast with /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ (see paragraph (iv)
above), is transcategorial, i.e. it may be attached to words belonging to several
parts of speech, including nominal constituents and predicative phrases.
Examples (575) and (576) both feature the verb déʼà occurring with a third person non-salientive subject. The number of the subject argument of déʼà in (575)
is left unspecified (in this case, the subject—a single man—is contextually singular). In (576), by contrast, déʼà bears the suffix /-gǘ/ ‘pl’, which in this case may
only indicate that its subject is plural since no other potentially plural argument is
present in the clause.

Although in this section I treat on the same level the seven identified strategies
for specifying the number feature of arguments within a predicative phrase, note
that not all of them can be equally said to be inflectional in nature. The encoding of number through index selection (see paragraph (i)) and predicative class
reassignment (see paragraph (ii)) may only operate in finite predicative phrases as it
4965.10. Strategies for participants number encoding
relies on strictly inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase. The remaining
five strategies (see paragraphs (iii–vii)), by contrast, rely on morphology that can
be considered as derivational in nature inasmuch as it may occur in non-finite
predicative phrases. For instance, the use of the plural allomorph of a verb root inflecting for number (strategy discussed in paragraph (iii)) and that of the suffix /-ē/
‘intr.pl’ (strategy discussed in paragraph (iv)) in zero-derived nominalizations are
illustrated in examples (577) and (578) respectively.

Note, however, that in spontaneous speech the plural (or collective) marking
morphological devices employed by these remaining five strategies rarely occur in
non-finite predicative phrases. In such contexts, their singular counterparts may
be generalized with, in practice, no indication of singular number implied.
Thus, in example (579), the singular allomorph of the verb meaning ‘to kill’ (ma̰)
is used in a non-finite nominalization while its “object” argument, which is syntactically treated as a genitive complement (/dùa-̰̃ ãr̀ ǖ/ ‘human-gen’), is referentially
plural (the noun dùã̰ ‘human’ virtually always has a plural referent, which the context indicates is also the case in this example).

Note, also, that the five strategies discussed in paragraphs (iii–vii), although
their application does not systematically correlate with the number features of arguments, are applied consistently in a majority of cases in spontaneous speech
(the strategy of predicative class reassignment described in (ii), in comparison, is
only resorted to occasionally).
For these reasons, while one cannot talk of a grammatical system of agreement
for number beyond the encoding of first and second person participants in smat (in
the way that one can talk of an elaborate smat grammatical system of agreement
for nominal class, in particular), number in the language may still be considered
to a certain extent as an inflectional category, even outside of first and second
person participants.","[495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503]"
"7.2.3Privative negationAnother context in which the mere adjunction of tãů ‘neg’ is not normally available as a strategy to convert a positive clause into its corresponding negative clause
is when possessive predication is involved (on positive possessive predication, see
Sections 4.2.5.3 and 4.3.3.6). In other words, a clause that predicates possession
by means of the possessive predicative suffix /-ã/̰ and/or the possessive verb ã̄ ‘to
have’ in its positive polarity (e.g. /chā=âirű-ã/̰ ‘I have a dog’ or /chā=ã-̄ pátā/
̊
‘I have a house’) can normally not be negated by means of tãů ‘neg’ (e.g. ? /tãu
̊ chā=ã-̄ pátā/ ‘I don’t have a house’).
chā=âirű-ã/̰ ‘I don’t have a dog’ or ? /tãu
A dedicated privative (i.e. negative possessive) verb root /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’

is regularly used instead and no other marker of negation appears in the clause
(e.g. /chā=g̃e-̊ ãr̀ ǖ âirű-ã/̰ ‘I don’t have a dog’ or /chā=g̃e-̊ pátā/ ‘I don’t have a
house’).298
As is regularly the case when incorporation of a nominal constituent into the
predicative phrase occurs (on incorporation, see Section 4.2.5), if the referent
whose being possessed is negated is referred to with a bound noun, then the privative predicative word takes on the form /g̃e-̊ /bound.noun (not.have-bound.noun),
as in examples (617–618). By contrast, if that referent is referred to with a full NP
(and with an independent noun in particular), then the privative predicative phrase
takes on the structure /g̃e-̊ ãr̀ ǖ NP-ã/̰ (not.have-gen NP-poss), as in (619).

"7.2.2Existential and topical-locational negationOne of the few contexts in which the mere adjunction of tãů ‘neg’ is not normally
available as a strategy to convert a positive clause into its corresponding negative
clause is when existential predication is involved (on existential predication, see
Section 3.4.4). In other words, a clause that includes an existential predicative
word in its positive polarity (e.g. Ná-ngēmà i ̀ chi ̆ʼnü.́ ‘There is pineapples.’) can normally not be negated by means of tãů ‘neg’ (e.g. ? Tãů ná-ngēmà i ̀ chi ̆ʼnü.́ ‘There is no
pineapples.’). A dedicated negative existential verb tåʼu ‘be absent’ is regularly
used instead and no other marker of negation appears in the clause (e.g. Ná-tåʼu
i ̀ chi ̆ʼnü.́ ‘There is no pineapples.’). This is illustrated in the following examples
((610) is repeated from (470)):

Existential negation is occasionally used to express privative negation; tåʼu
could then be glossed as ‘to lack’ (but see Section 7.2.3 below on a more common way to express privative negation). The referent whose being possessed is
negated then appears as a subject argument, and the one whose being a possessor
is negated is encoded as an oblique argument in the benefactive(-malefactive) case
(as in example (612)) or the genitive case (as in (613)) although the latter may also
be omitted altogether and left to be understood from the context (as in (614)):

Tåʼu ‘be absent’ is also used as the regular way to negate a clause that involves
topical-locational predication. Thus, a clause that includes, in its positive polarity, a locational predicative word not built on the punctual locative relational

(as in (616)). Note that by contrast to topical-locational predication, non-topical

Note that in the answer in example (450), although the events referred to (i.e.

to the utterance situation. That is, the speaker Moe (here enacted by the storyteller)

for a partitive object participant, in which case it differs whether it stands for a participant in the masculine, neuter, or non-salientive nominal class (partitive objects
in the feminine or salientive nominal class can never, for their part, be indexed on
the predicative phrase). The third person index in slot 7, which may stand for a
subject or an object argument depending on the context, may only take the values masculine/neuter/non-salientive (m/n/ns) or feminine (f). Incidentally, this
implies that salientive (s) third person subject or object arguments can never be
indexed in slot 7 and that their indexation, in contexts where they would be indexed in slot 7 if they belonged to another nominal class, therefore has to occur in
other slots (specifically in slot 4 in cases where they stand for a subject argument,
and—by a phenomenon of differential object marking—in slot 2 in cases where they
stand for an object argument, in which case they are encoded morphologically as
an accusative participant). The third person (masculine, neuter, or non-salientive)
object index in slot 8 is simply either present or absent. Likewise, the feature of
associated motion encoded in slot 5 is simply either present or absent. Finally, the
values encoded in slot 6 straightforwardly correspond to each of the five predicative classes of the language (note that pcØ, by contrast with the other predicative
classes, is morphologically unmarked in most cases, and that in such cases I do not,
accordingly, state its presence explicitly in glosses).
The following examples (repeated from (446) and (447) above) provide the
mapping of actual occurrences of inflected predicative phrases with the templatic analysis just put forward (the first row of these examples is repeated from

(as ‘.imp’, ‘.sbjv’, or ‘\sbjv’—the latter when the phonological exponent of ‘sbjv’ is
tonological). By contrast, where inflectional morphological material of ind is used,
no Inflectional Type gloss is featured (compare the glosses in examples (448a) and
(448c) below, for instance).
Imp is essentially identical to ind, except that it further lacks a slot 4.
Sbjv, by contrast with both ind and imp, does feature a slot 8, and does feature the value f in slot 7. In slot 4, however, sbjv does not feature the values
3m/n/ns, 3f, and 4. Subjects in these person & nominal class combinations are indexed in slot 7 instead. The morphemes used as explicit exponents of sbjv in slots
4 to 7 typically—but not systematically—involve a tonological deviation from
their default shape used in ind, namely a shift to toneme /1 / (as in e.g. /chā=/
‘1sg.sbj(.ind)’ featuring toneme /3 / vs /chà=/ ‘1sg.sbj\sbjv’, with /1 /; or /tá=/
‘3s.sbj(.ind)’ with /4 / vs /tà=/ ‘3s.sbj\sbjv’ with /1 /; but contrast these indexes,
whose toneme shifts to /1 / in sbjv, with the index /pē=/ ‘2pl.sbj(.ind)’, whose
toneme remains identical in sbjv, /pē=/ ‘2pl.sbj(.sbjv)’).
The specific inflectional morphology of each of the three Inflectional Types is
described at length in Sections 5.3–5.5.
Examples (448a–448d) illustrate the kind of morphological distinctions that
obtain between ind, imp, and sbjv. They are also intended to briefly exemplify the
kind of functional contrasts that obtain between ind (448a), imp (448b), sbjv
(448c), and the latter’s frequent combination sbjv-ʼü̃́ (448d), here comparing their
uses in main clauses (note that out of context, the translations provided in (448a–
448d) are no more than indicative translations among several other possibilities;
the function exemplified by each example is indicated in parentheses in the terms
of the functional distribution of the Inflectional Types outlined below in Table 41).

tà=rü=3s.sbj\sbjv=pcrǖ=rest\sbjv-sub‘[At that point,] she rests/she rested [specifically in a series of sequenced
processes].’
Note that the imp predicative phrase in (448b) only differs from the ind predicative phrase in (448a) by lacking a subject index in slot 4 (this informative absence
of marking is exceptionally materialized and glossed in this example as /(Ø=)/
‘(imp)’). On the other hand, the bare sbjv predicative phrase in (448c) only differs
from the ind predicative phrase in (448a) at the tonological level. The default subject morpheme /tá=/ ‘3s.sbj(.ind)’ in (448a) is replaced by /tà=/ ‘3s.sbj\sbjv’
in (448c). Note also that the lexical form of the verb ngǜ ‘to rest’ (with a lexical
toneme /21 /) in (448a) undergoes a morphotonological alternation process operating as a further exponent of sbjv and becomes ngʼü̆ (with a derived toneme /CM /) in
(448c). Importantly, the encoding of sbjv at a tonological level only occurs once
among the inflectional proclitics of the predicative phrase. This is why the predicative class morpheme /rǖ=/ ‘pcrǖ’ in (448c) remains identical as in (448a), as
sbjv in (448c) is already encoded tonologically on /tà=/ ‘3s.sbj\sbjv’. Finally, as
is self-evident, the sbjv-ʼü̃́ predicative phrase in (448d) further differs from (448a)
by the addition of the subordinator suffix /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’ to the sbjv predicative phrase
as it stands in (448c).
The general functional distribution of the three Inflectional Types proper
and sbjv-ʼü̃́ is summarized in Table 41 ([±ant] in the first rows of this table
stands for presence or absence of advancement of narrative time; on these notions,
see next section). In this table, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic functions are
listed together. As this table shows, only imp has a single, easily identifiable function. Ind, sbjv, and sbjv-ʼü̃́ occur in a variety of contexts with a variety of functions and display some functional overlap in main clauses. All of these functions
are extensively exemplified and commented upon in the following five sections
(5.2.2–5.2.6).

sbjv-ʼü̃́ (the Tikuna forms in parentheses are morphemes obligatorily or typically associated with the corresponding functions)3985.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
As a caveat, let me make clear that the terms Indicative, Imperative, and Subjunctive used to refer to the three Inflectional Types are to be understood as little
more than practical, mnemonic labels. Although they are borrowed from the
terminological tradition related to the grammatical category of mood, these labels
are by no means intended to suggest that the categories referred to here as
Inflectional Types can be, beyond a first approximation, identified and adequately described as moods. The functional distribution of ind, imp, and sbjv,
however, is vaguely reminiscent of that of the categories traditionally labeled as indicative, imperative, and subjunctive “moods” in the Romance languages. Because
many readers will presumably be familiar with that somewhat arbitrary terminological tradition, I have opted for applying it to smat’s Inflectional Types (rather
than arbitrarily labeling them as e.g. Inflectional Type 1, Inflectional Type 2, etc.)
with the practical purpose of making it easier for these readers to recognize and
distinguish them.","[398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404]"
"4.2.3.6/-V̄chi ̀/ ‘at’An illustration of the use of the FGC suffix /-V̄chi ̀/ ‘at’, which denotes a [+propinquity] topological relation, is provided in example (304) (intransitive PP).

Note, importantly, that despite the English translation of /ṹ-ūchi ̀/ (go.sg-at) as
‘came closer’ in example (304) (i.e. a translation that implies a notion of perspective
of an observer upon the process), the suffix /-V̄chi ̀/ does not in itself involve
any semantic indication of deixis. All this suffix tells in this utterance is that
over the course of the process (in this case, a durative spontaneous motion), the
figure (in this case, the deer) tends towards standing in a topological relation of
3054. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
propinquity with the ground (in this case, the mythical brothers Yoi and Ipi). The
deictic perspective imposed by a translation of this utterance into English is entirely
absent from its original smat version.
This FGC suffix, like its negative counterpart /-gàchi ̀/ ‘away’ (discussed in the
next section), is rare in discourse.","[310, 311]"
"1042.4. Toneme inventory
nothing suggests that any two of these tones could stand in a complementary distribution relationship according to any criterion. All can contrast in
essentially the same segmental and suprasegmental context, so that they may be
considered to be the realizations of as many separate tonemes. In particular, note
that the toneme of a given unstressed syllable is by no means conditioned by the
toneme of the syllable that immediately precedes it.
Interestingly, although smat only exhibits 5 tonal (and phonational) realizations on the surface in unstressed syllables, these 5 realizations can be analyzed as
being underlain by 6—not 5—tonemic values. Unstressed syllables featuring the
toneme that I transcribe as /4/1 / may alternatively surface with the tones [4 ]
or [1 ]. While in some cases the two alternative tonal realizations of these syllables appear to follow a complementary distribution rule, as in examples (66a–66c),
in other cases they stand in free variation—to varying degrees—in the exact same
phonological context, as in (66d) and (67):

[ˈto̞ː33 bɯ1 ]‘its food’‘our food’By exhibiting this ability to surface with two alternative tones, these syllables
differ both from syllables with a lexical toneme /4 /—as shown in (68)—and

ability:

as featuring /4/1 / are merely syllables with two alternative lexical forms, one of
which features /4 / and the other /1 /. However, the behavior of these syllables in
relation to morphotonological alternations, because it partially differs from
the behavior of syllables with /4 / and /1 /, leads me to consider /4/1 / as a separate phonological item distinct from both /4 / and /1 /. Examples (70–71) illustrate
this partial difference of behavior in the context of morphotonological alternations
occurring in predicative phrases in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type followed by
the relativizer in non-salientive /-∼ʔɯ4 / (see Section 2.6.2). In (70a), the predicative phrase /e34 -bɯ 4/1 / ‘to have no (raw) food’, which outside contexts of morphotonological alternations is typically realized [ˈŋe̞ː34 bɯ 4 ], i.e. with a tone [4 ]
in its second syllable, normally keeps its tone [4 ] when it is inflected in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type and followed by /-∼ʔɯ4 / ‘rel.ns’. In (70b), by contrast,
the predicative phrase /e34 -te 4 / ‘not to have a husband’, which outside contexts
of morphotonological alternations is realized [ˈŋe̞ː34 t ̪e̞ 4 ], i.e. also with a tone [4 ]
in its second syllable, sees its tone [4 ] turn into [5 ] in the same morphosyntactic
context.

sees its tone [1 ] turn into [3 ]. This time, the morphotonological alternation undergone by /4/1 / is in fact identical to that undergone by /1 /: indeed, in (70b) the
predicative phrase /∼ʔa33 -ga 1 / ‘to make noise (lit. ‘to have noise’)’, which outside
1062.4. Toneme inventory
contexts of morphotonological alternations is realized [ˈʔãː33 ga 1 ], i.e. also with a

‘which makes noise’The toneme /4/1 / is the only one to exhibit a (partial) sandhi behavior in
smat. In fact, the allotonic complementary distribution rule alluded to above and
illustrated in (66a–66c) is likely to have been obligatory in an former stage of the
language. Partially lexicalized morphological combinations involving a toneme
/4/1 / with a fixed realization, like those displayed in (72), point to a regular sandhi
rule whereby /4/1 / must have been regularly realized as [4 ] immediately after certain stressed tonemes while it was regularly realized as [1 ] immediately after others.

cases of free variation illustrated in (66d) and (67) above. This sandhi-like tendency
is summarized in Table 14 for syllables with /4/1 / occurring immediately after a
stressed syllable (my data are unclear as to how /4/1 / tends to be realized immediately after the toneme /CM / or any of the tonemes occurring in unstressed syllables).
Note that this sandhi-like tendency is generally much stronger for tonemes /4/1 / occurring in suffixes (e.g. in the derivational suffixes of the verb root and those of the
predicative phrase; see Sections 4.2.2 and 4.4, respectively) than in bound nouns.

"4.2.4Other suffixesThis section deals with the few derivational suffixes of the verb root that do
not contribute encoding of figure-ground relations (for a general list of these
suffixes, see Table 36). Note that by contrast with the system of figure-ground
configuration suffixes described in the previous section, the suffixes discussed in the
present section do not form a homogeneous class from a semantic perspective.
3104.2. Verbal predicative phrases
Apart from belonging to the morphological slot of the derivational suffixes of the
verb root, they only have in common the negative property of not denoting figureground relations.
The antipassive suffixes /-ètà/ ‘antip1’ and /-ē/ ‘antip2’ are, like the morphemes discussed in the following sections, derivational suffixes of the verb root
unrelated to the encoding of figure-ground configurations. Note, however, that
these two suffixes are treated separately in Section 4.5.1 towards the end of this
chapter together with other valency-manipulating devices.","[315, 316]"
"4.2.3.8/-pétǜ/ ‘across’The FGC suffix /-pétǜ/ ‘across’ denotes a transverse topological relation, i.e.
a relation (achieved or tended towards) of contiguity of the figure with the opposite
side of the ground, with “opposite” being defined by reference to the side of the
ground with which the figure is contiguous at the initial phase of the process. In
simpler words, /-pétǜ/ indicates that, in the process, the figure gets to be or tends
towards being at the other side of the ground. This FGC suffix, which I gloss ‘across’,

harm to them [i.e. to Yoi and his siblings by killing their father] passed one
after the other [i.e. from in front of Yoi to behind him].’ [lar C459–461]
The ground across which the figure gets to be or tends towards being may be a
physical entity, as in (306) (in this case, the mythical figure Yoi), but it may also be,
more abstractly, a period of time, as in (T120). The verb stem bearing /-pétǜ/
may then be rendered in English as ‘to spend (time)’.
Conversely, the figure itself may be an event, i.e. an abstract entity, that
metaphorically crosses a ground corresponding to an animate being, i.e. a physical
entity. The FGC suffix /-pétǜ/ then allows a participant referring to a life experience
to stand in the syntactic function of subject of intransitive verb stems translatable
into English as ‘to happen (to an animate being)’. The animate referent with the
semantic role of experiencer is encoded as a complement in the accusative, i.e. not
as a regular ground, which is normally encoded as a participant in the punctual
or areal locative. An occurrence of /-pétǜ/ in this semantic configuration, which
is only attested with the verb roots ü/́ chó ‘be there (sg./pl.)’ and g̃ū ‘to reach’, is
provided in the following example (see also (T58)):

at the initial phase of the process gets to be or tends towards being inverted
in the process. The semantics of /-ègù/ ‘inv’ are roughly comparable with those
of English ‘back’. In example (308) (intransitive PP), for instance, the figure (in
this case, a group of people), which is not contiguous with the ground (in this case,
the village where they stay at night) at the initial phase of the process, gets to be
contiguous with it at the final phase of the process (see also (247) for a similar
example):

the figure with the middle of the ground. An illustration of the use of this suffix
is provided in example (312) (transitive PP used in a passive construction; on the
passive construction, see Section 4.5.3).

If this analysis of /-yé/ as a FGC suffix is correct, then what is to be identified as the
figure in (312) is a cut (i.e. a non-prototypical figure) and the ground corresponds
to the skein.
Given the binary organization of part of the smat system of FGC suffixes in
pairs of suffixes respectively encoding the positive value and the negative value
of specific types of topological relations (e.g. /-ku̽chi ́, -ku̽/ [+containment] vs
/-ʼV̽chi ́, -ʼü̃̽/ [-containment]; /-V̄chi ̀/ [+propinquity] vs /-gàchi ̀/ [-propinquity]),
one may wonder whether /-yé/, if it is rightly classified as a FGC suffix, could not
be, in fact, the counterpart of the plurilocal suffix /-a̽/ (on which see the previous
section). Perhaps /-yé/ and /-a̽/ respectively denote the opposite values [singular]
and [plural] of a more general type of topological relation that one might label
[topological number]. If this hypothesis is correct, then the semantic contribution
of /-yé/ in (312) would not be to indicate that the skein was cut in its middle part
(so as to split in two halves of approximately equal size), but that it was cut in a
single cut (so as to split in two parts and no more than two). More data on this
suffix are needed to confirm or invalidate this speculative but plausible hypothesis.
This FGC suffix is rare in discourse.","[311, 312, 313, 314, 315]"
"4.2.5.1Formal typesFrom a strictly morphological perspective, incorporation in smat corresponds
to two different constructions, bound noun incorporation and NP incorporation.
(i) Bound noun incorporation Bound noun incorporation, a very frequent construction, allows a bound noun (alone, i.e. without the stressed morpheme or stem to which it would necessarily have been attached to occur as a free
syntactic constituent of the main clause in discourse) to be directly attached to
the right edge of a verb root or a verb stem. Because bound nouns are (invariably) unstressed forms in smat, the resulting incorporating verb stem constitutes a
single phonological word.
Illustrations of bound noun incorporation are given in example (328) (on the
identification of the syntactico-semantic types of incorporation provided in parentheses, see next section). Note that certain bound nouns belong to a lexical class of
bound morphemes that cause the morphotonological alternations /43 /→/31 / and
3184. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
.............................-ãr̀ ǖ .....-ã̰
verb.root/stem-gen NP-poss
In NP incorporation, the incorporated nominal constituent (which, as a well-formed
NP, necessarily bears a stress on its first syllable) retains its stress and consequently constitutes its own phonological word (or several phonological words,
in exceptional cases where the incorporated NP is syntactically complex) together
with the unstressed possessive suffix /-ã/̰ that it bears at its right edge.
Instances of the NP incorporation construction are provided in examples (329–
330) (see also (327) above; these three examples all involve incorporation of the
possessee incorporation functional type, on which see next section). Note that the
suffix /-ãr̀ ǖ/ gen belongs to the lexical class of bound morphemes that trigger
the Pattern 2 morphotonological alternations mentioned in the preceding paragraph (hence the forms /mê-ãr̀ ǖ/ [be.good-gen], from mé ‘be good’, in (329) and
/i ̋-ãr̀ ǖ/ [be.small-gen], from i ̰ ‘be small’, in (330)).

223]
The NP incorporation construction is the only one in smat to derive PPs made
of two or more phonological words. It is mostly attested in a single one of the
three syntactico-semantic types of incorporation identified in the following section,
specifically the one I call possessee incorporation.
3204.2. Verbal predicative phrases4.2.5.2Functional typesFrom a syntactic and semantic perspective, I distinguish three major types of
incorporation in smat: core argument incorporation, possessee incorporation,
and non-core participant incorporation.
(i) Core argument incorporation In core argument incorporation, the
semantic role of the incorporated constituent corresponds to the semantic role of
the subject of an intransitive verb root/stem or the object of a transitive verb
root/stem. The subject syntactic position of the intransitive verb root/stem, or the
object syntactic position of the transitive verb root/stem, is “absorbed” by the incorporated constituent. Core argument incorporation consequently decreases the
valency of the verb root/stem: an intransitive one becomes avalent (rare), a transitive one becomes intransitive. Core argument incorporation mostly incorporates
bound nouns (instead of entire NPs, but see (335)).
Only the bound noun /-ànè/ ‘space (i.e. land or sky)’ is attested in my data
to occur as an incorporated bound noun absorbing the subject position of an
intransitive verb root/stem (subject-absorbing incorporation is not attested at all
with an NP as the incorporated constituent). The resulting impersonal incorporating verb stem takes an expletive third person (non-salientive?) subject234 and
denotes a terrain condition (as in (331); see also (T30)), a weather condition (as in
(T105)), or a sky condition corresponding to a specific moment of day or night (as
in (332)235 ).

impersonal verb stem incorporating a subject-absorbing /-ànè/, seems to take ãē̄ màkǖ ‘lightning’ as
its subject.
234Although synchronically unanalyzable, the impersonal verb stem yâànè ‘be twilight’ in (332)
clearly features a fully-lexicalized instance of subject-absorbing incorporation of /-ànè/‘space’.

back to the village.] We arrive at twilight, at the very end of the afternoon
[lit. ‘... really when the sky is green.’?].’ [jgs 72]
Incidentally, the only cases in my data where (genuine) incorporation is applied twice within a single verb stem involve, as a second step, subject-absorbing
incorporation of /-ànè/ ‘space’ (for a case of a verb stem displaying both possessive pseudo-incorporation and possessee incorporation, see example (345)). Thus,
/nà=tá-chi ̋kà-ànē-ʼǘ̃/ (3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=be.big-room-space\sbjv-sub) ‘there
was a lot of room’ in (333) can be analyzed as featuring, first, a case of possessee
incorporation (‘[the room]POSSESSEE of the space is big’>‘the space is [room]-big’; on
possessee incorporation, see below) followed by a case of core argument incorporation absorbing a subject syntactic position (‘[the space]SBJ is room-big’>‘itEXPLETIVE
is [space]-room-big’).

in a maloca [i.e. so that all would fit in it at night?].”’ [jgs 428–429]
With bound nouns or NPs absorbing the object position of a transitive verb
root/stem, core argument incorporation usually produces verb stems/phrases that
denote relatively well-identified activities regularly practiced in Tikuna culture, as
in example (334) (see also (325) above, and tà-ãʼ̆ pàèʼü̃́ ‘they twisted chambira fiber’
in (T82) and ti ̄-düĝ ùnègüʼ̋ ü̃́ ‘they sharpened darts’ in (T83)).

creatures were playing in a river.] The hunter silently leaned his blowgun
against [a tree] and watched them.’ [gsg 1’37”–1’44”]
(ii) Possessee incorporation In possessee incorporation, the semantic role
of the incorporated constituent corresponds, like in core argument incorporation, to
the semantic role of the subject of an intransitive verb root/stem or the object
of a transitive verb root/stem. Possessee incorporation may also occasionally occur in cases where the semantic role of the incorporated constituent corresponds to
that of the complement in the accusative of an intransitive verb root/stem. However, unlike in core argument incorporation, no valency decrease occurs. The
subject, object, or accusative complement syntactic position—respectively—is not
absorbed by the incorporated constituent, but is instead occupied by a participant
that corresponds semantically to the possessor of the incorporated constituent.
3234. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
Thus, in possessee incorporation, the syntactic valency of the verb root/stem remains unchanged, but the mapping of its syntactic valency onto semantic roles is
reorganized. In the case of a transitive verb root/stem, for instance, the presence
of possessee incorporation implies that the participant in object position is not the
patient, but the possessor of the patient, which is itself expressed as the incorporated constituent. Possessee incorporation allows a semantic possessor to be
promoted to the syntactic position of its possessee and, as a result, to benefit
from an increase in discursive salience, in particular over its possessee. Like core
argument incorporation, possessee incorporation may yield relatively lexicalized
incorporating verb stems (involving an incorporated bound noun) denoting wellidentified concepts in the Tikuna culture, but it is generally much more flexible
and productive than core argument incorporation.
Instances of possessee incorporation involving an incorporated constituent whose
possessor occupies the subject position of an intransitive verb root/stem are
provided in examples (336) (bound noun incorporation; see also (328a) above, and
/yŭ-nátǖ/ [die-father] ‘to lose one’s father’ [lit. ‘to father-die’] in (472)) and (337)

3254. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
(iii) Non-core participant incorporation Finally, in non-core participant incorporation, the semantic role of the incorporated constituent does
not correspond to that of either of the possible core arguments of the verb
root/stem. The interpretation of that semantic role is mostly left to context and
may be delicate to establish with certainty. In most cases, the referent identified
by the incorporated constituent can be broadly interpreted as having the semantic
role of a ground (portion of space proper, as in example (341); container, as in
(342); or vehicle, as in (328b) above) or as characterizing the state reached by
the object of a transitive verb denoting a transformation process (as in (343); see
also (169)). The valency of the verb root/stem and its mapping of syntactic positions with semantic roles are left unaltered. Non-core participant incorporation
virtually always involves the incorporation of bound nouns (not entire NPs). Like
possessee incorporation, non-core participant incorporation may yield relatively
lexicalized incorporating verb stems, although it is generally more flexible and
productive than core argument incorporation.

[jsg B258]4.2.5.3Pseudo-incorporation in possessive predicationPossessive predication of participants expressed as bound nouns exclusively operates through a construction that is formally identical with bound noun incorporation and appears to incorporate the bound noun to the verb roots ã̄ ‘to
have’ (positive possessive predication) or g̃e-̊ ‘not have’ (negative possessive—
or privative—predication, on which see Section 7.2.3). Possessive predication of
participants expressed as NPs may similarly operate through a construction that is
formally identical with NP incorporation and involves the same two verb roots,
although in the case of participants expressed as NPs an alternative construction
involving non-verbal predication is available, and apparently preferred over NP incorporation to ã̄ or g̃e-̊ (on this alternative construction, see Section 4.3.3.6). Note,
however, that the incorporation-like constructions employed for possessive predication are not, strictly speaking, genuine incorporation given that their possessee
participant cannot be extracted from ã̄ or g̃e-̊ so as to be expressed as a separate,
syntactically independent nominal constituent. Furthermore, from a syntacticosemantic perspective, these incorporation-like constructions do not quite fit with
any of the three functional types identified in the previous section. For these reasons, I consider them as cases of pseudo-incorporation, rather than incorporation
proper.
Instances of possessive pseudo-incorporation of a bound noun are provided
in examples (344) and (345).

Note that /kù=ã-̄ ya̋e-̄ pǜtā/ (2sg.sbj\sbjv=have-hair-tooth\sbjv) ‘he [lit.

reference to a third person participant to convey a notion of surprise, see Section 3.3.6, p.206).
An instance of possessive pseudo-incorporation of an NP is provided in the
following example:

see example (347) (the only case of formal incorporation where the (pseudo-)incorporated constituent is a syntactically complex NP in my corpus) and the examples in
Section 7.2.3.

Interestingly, the possessee participant of a positive possessive pseudo-incorporation construction,236 minimally in cases where it is an NP (as opposed to a bound
noun, for which I do not have spontaneous data), may be relativized using a kind
of gapping strategy. The pseudo-incorporated constituent is then dropped and the
possessive suffix /-ã/̰ gets directly attached to the verb stem after the genitive suffix /-ãr̀ ǖ/ (as in e.g. /chā=ã-̄ ãr̀ ǖ âirű-ã̰/ [1sg.sbj=have-gen dog-poss] ‘I have

object in smat, while relativizing participants with any other syntactic function
regularly involves the use of a resumptive pronominal form standing for the pivot
within the relative clause. An instance of relativization of the NP possessee participant of a positive pseudo-incorporation construction is provided in the following
example:

2363294. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
San Martín is [jungle] that is exploited by man [lit. ‘... is [a jungle] that
[people] have worked in already.’]’ [jgs 220–221]4.3Non-verbal predicative phrasesSeveral types of non-verbal predicative phrases are attested in smat. These are
listed in Table 37. They involve the combination of a nominal constituent (a
circumstantial independent noun, a—non-circumstantial—independent noun, or an
entire NP) or an onomatopoeia together with a bound morpheme, which may be
either a suffix (/-ʼü̽̃/ ‘temp.pred’, /-ē/ ‘event.pred’, or /-ã/̰ ‘poss’), a predicative
relational noun (/-gu̽/ ‘ploc’, /-ràʼǜ̃/ ‘like’, /-ʼpḛʼe/ ‘equal’, /-ʼchàʼǜ̃/ ‘vol’, or
/-ʼwa̰e/̄ ‘apprec’ or one of its subdialectal variants), or a bound noun.
From a semantic perspective, the resulting PPs serve for the expression of a
varied array of predication types. The meaning of each formal type of nonverbal predication identified in Table 37 is roughly glossed in the column ‘Resulting
PP’ (with ‘X’ standing for the respective nominal constituent to which the bound
morpheme in the leftmost column of the table is attached in the respective formal
type of non-verbal predication).
Note that, as indicated by plus signs <+> in Table 37, certain of the bound
morphemes that turn a nominal constituent into a non-verbal PP trigger the morphotonological alternation /43 /→/31 / when they are immediately attached to
the Allomorph 1 of a pronominal root featuring a lexical toneme /43 / (a process
that represents an instance of Pattern 2 morphotonological alternation, on which
see Section 2.6.2.2; on the definition of the Allomorph 1 of pronominal roots,
see Section 3.3.1). Thus, the combination of the pronominal root /ná-/ ‘3n/ns’
with the predicative relational noun /-ʼchàʼü̃̀/ ‘vol’, for instance, yields the form
/nâ-ʼchàʼǜ̃/, with the lexical toneme /43 / of /ná-/ turning into /31 / (/nâ-/). Note
that, by definition, only bound nouns and relational nouns can be directly attached
to the Allomorph 1 of pronominal roots. Suffixes, by contrast with bound nouns
and relational nouns, are defined as bound morphemes that cannot be attached to
the Allomorph 1 of pronominal roots. That is why the bound morphemes in Table 37 that are suffixes, as opposed to bound nouns and relational nouns, feature
the mention ‘n/a’ (for ‘not applicable’) in the column ‘MA trigger’ (for ‘Pattern 2
Morphotonological Alternation trigger’).
The various types of non-verbal predication listed in Table 37 are discussed
and exemplified individually in the next sections (see the corresponding section

"Chapitre 3 – Syntagme nominal
Ce chapitre commence par une introduction générale à la morphosyntaxe du
syntagme nominal (SN) en tsma (Section 3.1), puis explore plus en détail quatre
points présentant un intérêt particulier à l’intérieur de ce domaine, à savoir la question de la distinction entre substantifs indépendants et substantifs liés (Section 3.2),
le système pronominal (Section 3.3), le système des démonstratifs non locatifs
(Section 3.4) et enfin la morphosyntaxe du joncteur, un morphème à la distribution
unique dans la langue (Section 3.5). Le chapitre s’achève sur une brève introduction au système de marquage des fonctions syntaxiques des syntagmes nominaux
(Section 3.6).
Les principaux éléments qui entrent dans la composition morphosyntaxique interne du SN en tsma sont :
1. les substantifs indépendants, qui sont des formes libres ;
2. les substantifs liés, qui sont des formes liées ;
621C. Résumé en français
3. les racines pronominales et les mots pronominaux indépendants dérivés de
celles-ci ;
4. les racines démonstratives non locatives et les mots démonstratifs non locatifs
indépendants dérivés de celles-ci ;
5. les racines démonstratives locatives et les mots démonstratifs locatifs indépendants dérivés de celles-ci ;
6. les nominalisations sans marque morphologique, c’est-à-dire des syntagmes
prédicatifs directement employés en fonction de constituants nominaux sans
marquage morphologique associé ;
7. une poignée de morphèmes dérivationnels – peu fréquents – qui ne peuvent
s’attacher qu’à des mots nominaux ;
8. la proposition relative, formée au moyen du suffixe relativeur, et la proposition subordonnée en /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’, c’est-à-dire des propositions occupant une
fonction de constituant nominal et dont le référent est respectivement un participant ou un procès ;
9. le déterminant indéfini wi ́ʼá ‘indf’ ;
10. et enfin le joncteur, qui a pour fonction prototypique de marquer explicitement la relation de constituance liant entre eux deux constituants nominaux
dont l’un sert de modifieur à l’autre et qui forment ensemble un unique SN
complexe.
Il est important de noter, au sujet de la distribution syntaxique du joncteur, que
certains types de modifieurs précèdent presque toujours directement le SN qu’ils
modifient, c’est-à-dire sans l’intervention du joncteur. Il s’agit avant tout des mots
démonstratifs non locatifs, d’une part, et des syntagmes génitivaux (qui sont des
syntagmes nominaux portant le suffix de cas /-ãr̀ ǖ/ ‘gen’), d’autre part. Wi ́ʼá ‘indf’
est sujet à de la variation intergénérationnelle : alors que chez les locuteurs âgés,
wi ́ʼá requiert la présence du joncteur (entre lui et le SN qu’il détermine) quel que
soit le contexte, chez les locuteurs moins âgés, en revanche, il a tendance à ne
déclencher la présence du joncteur qu’en contexte passé.
Les éléments 1. à 4. de la liste ci-dessus sont traités en détail dans les Sections 3.2–3.5. Les éléments 5. à 8. ne sont pas examinés en profondeur dans cette
étude. On pourra cependant les observer à l’œuvre dans une partie importante des
exemples présentés tout au long de ce travail.
622C. Résumé en françaisChapitre 4 – Syntagmes prédicatifs verbal etnon-verbal et leur morphologie non-flexionnelle
La Figure 1 représente de façon schématique la structure générale du syntagme
prédicatif (SP) en tsma. Ce chapitre traite des divers types de structures morphologiques qui peuvent se rencontrer à l’intérieur du niveau structurel entouré en
rouge dans cette figure. Plus concrètement, on y présente les différents types de SP
attestés dans la langue, qui se répartissent en SP verbaux et SP non verbaux. On
y décrit par ailleurs, d’une part, la morphologie dérivationnelle propre au SP verbal (qui est subdivisée en dérivation proprement dite et incorporation nominale)
et, d’autre part, la morphologie dérivationnelle à laquelle ont accès aussi bien le
SP verbal que le SP non verbal. Les opérations morphologiques dont le domaine
d’action correspond au niveau structurel entouré en pointillé noir dans la Figure 1
relèvent de la morphologie flexionnelle du SP fini. Elles font l’objet d’un traitement
à part dans le Chapitre 5.
Comme mentionné ci-dessus, les SP en tsma se répartissent en deux grands
types, le SP verbal et le SP non verbal (qui correspondent respectivement à chacune
des deux zones entourées d’un trait noir épais dans la Figure 1).
Le SP verbal peut être formé d’une racine verbale seule, comme dans l’exemple
suivant :
(1) chā=ná=chi ́1sg.acc=3m/n/ns.sbj=piquer‘elle m’a piqué’Il peut également consister en un thème verbal morphologiquement complexe, fait
de la combinaison d’une racine verbale avec un (et un seul) suffixe dérivationnel
de la racine verbale. Le SP montré dans l’exemple suivant consiste ainsi en un
thème verbal composé de la même racine verbale que le SP contenu dans l’exemple
précédent, auquel s’adjoint cependant le suffixe dérivationnel de la racine verbale
/-a̽/, qui indique qu’une figure (en l’occurrence un dard ou des piqûres de guêpe)
est dans une relation spatiale plurielle avec un fond (en l’occurrence le locuteur) :
(2) chā=ná=chi ́-à1sg.acc=3m/n/ns.sbj=piquer-plloc‘elle m’a piqué à plusieurs endroits (de mon corps)’623C. Résumé en français
Enfin, le SP verbal ou non verbal « élémentaire » tel qu’il vient d’être décrit
(niveau structurel entouré en bleu dans la Figure 1) peut par ailleurs recevoir un
ou plusieurs suffixes dérivationnels du SP, et ainsi former un SP « étendu » (niveau
structurel entouré en rouge dans la Figure 1). À titre d’exemple, la totalité des SP
élémentaires présentés jusqu’ici en (1–4) peuvent recevoir le suffixe dérivationnel
du SP /-gǘ/, qui marque la pluralité de l’un des participants du procès :
(5)a. chā=ná=chi ́-gǘ1sg.acc=3m/n/ns.sbj=piquer-pl‘elles m’ont piqué’b. chā=ná=chi ́-à-gǘ1sg.acc=3m/n/ns.sbj=piquer-plloc-pl‘elles m’ont piqué à plusieurs endroits (de mon corps)’
c. chā=ná=chi ́-kùtü-̄ gǘ

Ce chapitre s’organise comme suit. La Section 4.2 traite du SP verbal, c’està-dire de la racine verbale, de l’essentiel de sa morphologie dérivationnelle propre, et enfin de l’incorporation de constituants nominaux. Les divers sous-types de
SP non verbal sont exposés dans la Section 4.3. La morphologie dérivationnelle
du SP, c’est-à-dire l’ensemble des suffixes dérivationnels qui peuvent généralement
s’attacher aussi bien au SP verbal qu’au SP non verbal, est examinée en majeure
partie dans la Section 4.4. Enfin, les morphèmes dérivationnels qui opèrent spécifiquement sur la valence du SP (à savoir les deux derniers suffixes dérivationnels de
la racine verbale et les deux derniers suffixes dérivationnels du SP) sont traités séparément dans la Section 4.5, aux côtés de deux constructions qui affectent également la valence du SP mais sans impliquer aucun marquage morphologique associé.","[626, 627, 628, 629, 630]"

As is to be expected, an example such as (154) shows that not just any social
group with which the speaker identifies may be referred to as a fourth person
participant, but only culturally highly relevant ones, i.e. ones that best define one’s
identity, and in particular ethnicity and race as in the preceding examples. In this
example and the stretches of discourse that precede and follow it, the speaker is
comparing the working conditions of tourist guides, being one himself, with those
of other members of the community who work at a construction site. The two social
groups thus defined by the speaker are certainly not relevant and stable enough for
him to refer to the one he belongs to as an in-groups fourth person participant
(contrast (154) with (152) above, where in comparing two ethnic or racial groups
the speaker refers to the one she identifies with as a fourth person participant).

Importantly, I was the only hearer present when (150–152) were uttered. The
fact that I am neither a Tikuna nor an Indigenous South American shows that the
in-groups fourth person does not have to include the hearer among its referents, which makes it significantly distinct semantically from first person plural
inclusive uses of the fourth person. Note also that in examples (150) through (153),
uses of the fourth person, however vague, are referential inasmuch as they do
point to identifiable individuals in the real world. This, in its turn, makes the ingroups use of the fourth person significantly distinct semantically from its generic
use exemplified next.
2103.4. Non-locative demonstratives
Examples (155–156) illustrate the generic use of the fourth person (see also
(T116–T119)). This use largely overlaps functionally with the generic use of the
second person singular (compare (144) above). Note that in the free English translations provided for these examples, the fourth person, which could be more literally
translated as ‘one’, is rendered as a second person singular (‘you’).

3.4.1Non-locative demonstratives
Introduction to the demonstratives in smatsmat features two major classes of nominal demonstratives, which I call nonlocative demonstratives and locative demonstratives, respectively (the roots
on which these are based are displayed in Tables 30 and 31 and commented upon
below).
2113. The nominal phrase
The non-locative demonstrative roots are displayed in Table 30 with all of their
basic inflectional forms (where two allomorphs are listed, the second one occurs
specifically when suffixed with /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’; items in parentheses are only marginally attested). The two series of locative demonstrative roots are listed in Table 31 for reference. The morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of the
words that may be derived from the non-locative demonstrative roots are discussed
individually in the following sections. Note that the uses of the locative demonstrative roots and the words that may be derived from them are not covered in this
grammatical description. The following paragraphs introduce a few preliminary
observations as to the general organization of the system of smat demonstratives.
As suggested in Tables 30 and 31, the demonstratives, whether non-locative
or locative, are organized along an axis of three grammatical degrees of “distance” that I label “proximal” (prox), “medial” (med), and “distal” (dist). Both
the non-locative and the locative demonstrative roots may enter in the formation of
demonstrative words with exophoric as well as endophoric reference. Endophoric
demonstratives essentially refer to elements that are part of the linguistic context
of a speech act (as in examples (158) and (161) above), while exophoric demonstratives refer to elements that are part of the non-linguistic context, e.g. real-world
entities that are part of the physical environment where the speech act occurs (as in
(157) and (159) above). In cases where the demonstrative roots are employed for
exophoric reference (i.e., in most cases, when they are suffixed with /-à/ ‘exo’),
the three degrees of distance generally correspond, rather straightforwardly, to
three ranges of physical distance. They are specifically used to convey—broadly
speaking—that the referent is within reach (prox; this and here), out of reach but at
a short distance (med; that and there), or out of reach and at a longer distance (dist;
that over there and over there) relative to the deictic center (which, in a majority of
cases, corresponds to the speaker).
The respective functions of the three degrees of distance are less straightforward
in cases where the demonstrative roots are employed for endophoric reference
(i.e., in most cases, when they are suffixed with /-ma̽/ ‘exo’). Briefly, the medial demonstratives can be characterized as the default forms for anaphoric
(and possibly cataphoric) reference, whether the referent is a participant or a
propositional content. For anaphoric reference in pre-hodiernal past contexts (i.e.
contexts referring to a past that precedes today), older speakers usually—but not
obligatorily—use the distal demonstratives instead of the medial demonstratives.
Younger speakers, however, tend to generalize the medial demonstratives regard2143.4. Non-locative demonstratives
less of the temporal setting (pre-hodiernal past or non-pre-hodiernal-past) of the
processes referred to. In most of their occurrences, the proximal demonstratives
roots, when used in the same morphosyntactic contexts where the medial and distal
demonstrative roots fulfill endophoric functions, do not involve endophoric reference strictly speaking, but point symbolically at temporal or spatial referents that
partially coincide with the temporal or spatial setting of the utterance act itself (in
phrases with meanings such as ‘this year [in which you and me are talking]’, ‘this
house [where you and me are right now]’, or ‘here [where you and me are right
now]’). Occurrences of the proximal demonstrative roots in such contexts are in
practice rare in spontaneous speech. The widely diverging semantic and pragmatic
uses of the three-fold distance dimension of the paradigms of demonstrative roots,
depending on whether they are employed for exophoric or endophoric reference,
are discussed and exemplified in the following sections.
Note, additionally, that the non-locative demonstrative roots are among the
forms that inflect for nominal class (simultaneously involving within a single
paradigm cases of tonological inflection, as in /yi ̂-/ ‘med.n’ vs /yi ̆-/ ‘med.m’, suppletive inflection, as in /yi ̂-/ ‘med.n’ vs /ngē-/ ‘med.ns’, and inflection through
the addition of segmental material, as in /yi ̂-/ ‘med.n’ vs /yi ̂ʼè/ ‘med.s’205 ). They
obligatorily agree with the participant they relate to, whether the latter is syntactically present (as a head in cases where a demonstrative is used as a modifier; see
example (159)) or not (cases where a demonstrative constitutes a complete NP on
its own and the participant it relates to is to be understood contextually; see (160)).
Interestingly, alongside a default salientive form unspecified for number (column s
in Table 30), the non-locative demonstratives feature an (infrequently occurring)
specific inflectional form employed to refer to explicitly plural referents assigned to
the salientive nominal class (column s.pl). Such specifically plural non-salientive
forms are almost unattested in the paradigms of other forms inflecting for nominal
class in the language. Most forms of the non-locative demonstrative roots (with the
exception of the default salientive forms) cannot stand on their own in discourse
and only occur with additional morphology.
The syllables /-ʼè/ and /-ã/̰ or /-ã/̀ in the default salientive and specifically plural salientive
forms of the non-locative demonstrative roots (columns s and s.pl in Table 30) are most likely
cognate with the homonymous default salientive and specifically plural salientive forms of the relativizer. Although best considered as unanalyzable from a synchronic perspective, the salientive
forms of the demonstrative roots, by contrast to their other inflectional forms, thus seem to be relatively easily analyzable from a diachronic perspective as the agglutinative association of a demonstrative morpheme with a morpheme encoding (perhaps alongside other features) nominal class.
2052153. The nominal phrase
The locative demonstratives, for their part, exist in two series. These mostly
correspond to forms that may directly commute (i.e. without additional marking)
with a NP bearing the areal locative relational noun /-wa̋/ on the one hand (such
as the first demonstrative in example (158)), and forms that may commute with a
NP bearing the punctual locative relational noun /-gu̽/ on the other (such as the
second demonstrative in (158)). On the functions of the relational nouns /-wa̋/
‘aloc’ and /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’, see Section 3.6.2.
The non-locative demonstratives and a few other forms morphologically related to them are discussed and exemplified at length in the following sections. Note
that smat additionally features a demonstrative verb, the irregular bipartite verb
/ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’, whose first morphological component /ña̋-/ñâ-/ is
likely cognate with the non-salientive and feminine allomorphs (/ñå-/ and /ñá-/
respectively) of the proximal demonstrative root. The demonstrative verb is dealt
with separately in Chapter 6.
For a fine-grained semantic and pragmatic study of the non-locative and
locative demonstratives in the Cushillococha variety of Tikuna, and of the exact
values of the three grammatical degrees of distance mentioned above in particular,

‘butterfly’I have found no set of strictly minimal pairs that would illustrate the 10
tonal contrasts in stressed syllables with the exact same segmental sequence.
This is probably to be expected: when a single phonological parameter exhibits
such a rich inventory of values, complete sets of strictly minimal pairs illustrating
the contrasts of all of these values should be comparatively unlikely to be found,
simply because the probability of coming across lexical gaps inevitably increases
together with the size of the set being looked for. However, I could relatively
easily collect sets of exact tonological minimal pairs of up to 7 items, whether
through elicitation or in spontaneous data. Table 12 displays fifteen such sets
composed of 4 to 7 items. This table provides the approximate meaning—only one
of them for items with several meanings—of given combinations of segments and
tonemes. Note that an empty cell does not necessarily imply that the corresponding
combination does not exist, but only that it is in any case unattested in my data.
As can be seen in Table 12, my data do not reveal any pattern of complementary distribution according to syllables’ segments or nasality value among
the 10 tones that occur in stressed syllables. Such a pattern would have shown
certain tones to be contextual allotones of a single toneme. This would have resulted in a reduction of the inventory of tonemes to less than 10 items. On the
contrary, the absence of any such complementary distribution implies that all of
these tones do contrast phonologically with one another. Missing combinations of
a given (elsewhere attested) toneme with a given (elsewhere attested) segmental
syllable are to be interpreted as mere lexical gaps.43 Indeed, while a few phonotactic restrictions do apply to certain segmental combinations within a single syllable
(see Section 2.5.2), there is nearly no phonotactic restriction at all as to the
combination of any given toneme with any given segmental string forming a
phonotactically viable syllable (for the only case of such a restriction, see end of
During our working sessions, one of my main informants, jsg, was in fact perfectly able to
repeat or make up such lexically unattested combinations, although he would eventually reject
them as non-sensical. This observation is of course not definitive evidence as to the phonological
status of the 10 tones in stressed syllables, but would be less expected if those combinations in fact
violated phonological rules instead of merely happening to be absent from the lexicon.

Section 2.5.2).532.4.2Alternative analyses in stressed syllablesTwo hypotheses that have been suggested in studies on Tikuna tonology could
have resulted in reducing to less than 10 the total number of underlying tonemes
needed to account for the tonal contrasts found on the surface in smat stressed syllables. However, as shown in Sections 2.4.2.1 and 2.4.2.2, where they are respectively assessed, these two hypotheses do not receive significant support from my
data, which is the reason why I believe that the ten-toneme analysis developed in
the previous section is, for language-internal descriptive purposes at the very least,
the most appropriate for today’s smat stressed syllables.

(321)a. tô-téb. wài-téfetch-apart

might have—very hypothetically—a semantically non-straightforward cognacy relationship (based, perhaps, on the conception that somebody’s husband is a portion
of them).
(ii) /-né/ ‘repeatedly?’. The meaning of this suffix is possibly related to the notion of repetition. In most cases, it co-occurs with the suffix /-kǘʼü/ ‘intens.iter’,
as in (322a–322b) (on /-kǘʼü/, see Section 4.4.2.7).
