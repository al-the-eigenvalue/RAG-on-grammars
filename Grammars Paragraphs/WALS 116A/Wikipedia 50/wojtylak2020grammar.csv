"11.2.4 Alternative questions
An alternative type of questions is formed by a disjunction of two simple polar questions (of
which, the second is always negated). The final element in the alternative question is always
a negated verb, with rising-falling intonation. This is illustrated in (11.44-46):
(11.44) PedroS
bi-t-ePRED
oo bi-ñe-d-e?PRED
Pedro
come-LK-3 or come-NEG-LK-3
‘Did Pedro come (lit. did Pedro come or didn’t he come)?’
oo roko-ñe?PRED
(11.45) FlorA rokoPRED
Pedro cook
or rook-NEG
‘Did Flor cook (lit. did Flor cook or didn’t she cook)?’
(11.46) (nai-makɨ)S
ɨraɨzi-d-ePRED
oo ɨraɨzi-ñe-d-e?PRED
ANA.SP-CLF:PR.GR.AN celebrate-LK-3 or celebrate-NEG-LK-3
‘Did they celebrate (lit. did they celebrate or they didn’t celebrate)?’
The origin of the discourse linker oo that conjoins the two questions is unclear. It has the
form of the Spanish discourse linker o meaning ‘or’. Nowadays, even the Murui elders never
drop the linker oo in questions that involve the ‘X not X’ opposition. These alternative
questions form a single unit. They can be answered with jɨɨ ‘yes, no’ when the answer is
negative (note the function of jɨɨ is to confirm a positive or a negative value of the478
preposition). When the answer is positive, then a verb is repeated without negative marking.
For instance, to answer positively the alternative question in (11.44), one says bi-t-e! (comeLK-3) ‘He came!’.","[502, 503]"
"10.3.1 Negative answers
Murui lacks independent positive and negative words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’. 281 The language has
three ways to respond to positive and negative questions. They involve:
– the interjection jɨɨ whose meaning ‘yes, no’ depending on the polarity of the verb
used in a question, or
– a full clause.
Often both mechanisms are combined. The interjection jɨɨ can be interpreted as some type of
agreement rather than a full-fledged positive or negative response item. Examples (10.90-91)
illustrate the reading of jɨɨ which ‘agrees’ with the verb’s polarity:
(10.90) a. iraiS bono-dɨ-o?PRED
fire burn.SMLF-LK-2sg
‘Did you set the fire?’
b. jɨɨ!
yes
‘Yes.’280Murui has no word for ‘bad’. Maraiñede ‘no good’ is the nearest approximation of the English ‘bad’, theantonym of ‘good’.
281Murui has also an independent positive response form ɨjɨ ‘uh-huh/yes’ used by hearers and speakers mainlyas a type of an acknowledgment during narration of traditional stories.",[478]
"11.2.5 Exclamative questions and sentences
Interrogative forms with nɨɨ and buu followed by the focus marker -ka are commonly used in
exclamations. An example is given in (11.47) (see also example T2.27 in the Appendix). See
(3.99) in §3.3.4 for an example of an exclamative sentence containing buu-ka (Q1-FOC).

erua?
AT.LOC:NSP see.really11.2.6 Answers to questions
The answer to a content question can consist only of the focused part, or it can be a whole
clause. For instance, two types of answer are possible for the question nɨ-no-mo Tadave i-te?
(Q2-CLF:SP.PLACE-LOC Tadave exist-LK-3) ‘Where is Tadave?’:

‘She is at home.’i-t-ePRED
exist-LK-3(11.49) jo-fo-moLOC
house-CLF:CAV-LOC
‘At home.’
Another frequent way of answering one’s question is the ‘confirmative’ interjection jɨɨ that is
used when a speaker ‘agrees’ with the value of the preposition. Simply saying, depending on
the polarity of the verb in the question, jɨɨ will be interpreted as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. The
element in focus, or even a whole clause, may or may not be repeated. Examples are given in
(11.50-51):479

(10.91) a. irai bono-ñe-dɨ-o?PRED
fire burn.SMLF-LK-2sg
‘Didn’t you set the fire?’
b. jɨɨ!

‘No.’
Frequently, when as an answer to a negative question, as in (10.91b), the independent word
jɨɨ is stressed, the predicate has a slightly higher pitch, and it is accompanied by a firm
headshake. A negative answer can also be a full clause. (10.92-93) could be the answers to
either (10.90a) or (10.91a) above.
(10.92) bono-dɨ-kuePRED
burn.SMLF-LK-1sg
‘I set the fire. ‘
(10.93) bono-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
burn.SMLF-NEG-LK-1sg
‘I didn’t set the fire. ‘
The negative answer can also consist of the interjection jɨɨ and a full clause combined, as in
(10.94-95):
(10.94) (jɨɨ!) bono-dɨ-kuePRED
yes burn.SMLF-LK-1sg
‘Yes, I did set the fire. ‘
(10.95) (jɨɨ!) bono-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
no burn.SMLF-NEG-LK-1sg
‘No, I didn’t set the fire. ‘
When one disagrees, they respond with jɨɨ obligatorily followed by a full clause with reversed
polarity. When a question is positive, as in (10.96), a full clause is marked for negation, as in
(10.97); cf. with (10.98). In case of a negative question, as in (10.99), the full clause is
positive, as in (10.100); cf (10.101).

Example (10.102) is a negative answer to the question uru-e-re-dɨ-o? (child-CLF:G-ATT-LK2sg) ‘Do you have children?’. Additionally, the noun uru-e ‘child’ which is the head of the
intransitive predicate, takes negative attributive marking to express lack of possession.
(10.102) jɨɨ! uru-e-ni-dɨ-kuePRED
no child-CLF:G-PRIV-LK-1sg
‘No! I don’t have children.’
The young speakers of Murui negate the ‘positive possession’ expressed with the positive
attributive -re with the standard negative -ñe, as in (10.103a-b). The elders consider this to be
incorrect. Once a Murui elder Lucio asked Walter whether he had a boat motor. Walter
answered with (10.103a). Lucio corrected him with (10.103b):
(10.103) a.b.","[478, 479, 480]"
"Example (11.33) was uttered by an angry grandmother to her naughty granddaughter. In this472
example code-switching is a way of imposing grandmother’s authority over the child (for
whom Spanish is the dominant language, rather than Murui).
(11.33) niña!

Such commands are solely used by those who have to maintain power and authority within
the family. For instance, while a child or a young person cannot direct neither E1 or E2
command-type to an elder, a young mother can use it when talking to her child.
All types of Murui command strategies differ in their strength. A brief summary of
this is given in Table 11.5.

11.2 Questions ‒ general characteristics
A real question requires an answer, unlike a rhetorical question or an interrogative command
(Dixon, 2010, p. 390). Murui distinguishes between content (§11.2.1), polar (§11.2.2), tag
(§11.2.3), and alternative questions (§11.2.4). All of these have some phonological and
morphological properties characteristic for them (i.e. different intonation patterns, presence
of a tag, and special kind of morphological elisions). Murui interrogative content words are
discussed in §3.3.4.
From the phonological point of view polar and content questions have a distinct
intonation. 288 Generally, Murui has three intonation types: falling (A) for declarative
sentences, rising-falling (B) for questions and commands, and rising intonation (C) for
calling from a distance. The rising-falling intonation in questions distinguishses the risingfalling (B1) intonation for content questions, rising-falling (B2) intonation for polar questions
(B2), and rising-falling (B3) intonation for commands (see §2.4). Morphologically, the
content questions and the polar questions are marked in similar fashion. 289 Polar questions
differ from content questions in the optionality of verbal marking for 3rd person. Murui tag
questions are characterized by the presence of a special tag words erua and ua. In addition to
content, polar, and tag questions, Murui has also a special kind of alternative question that
involves the ‘X not X’ opposition. Gestures, such as raised eyebrows, wide-open eyes and
eye contact with the addressee, generally accompany all kinds of questions in Murui.
Commonly used answers to questions and greeting formulae are dicussed in §11.2.6-7.","[496, 497, 498]"
"474
11.2.1 Content questions
Content questions are considered to be questions that seek information and include an
interrogative content word (Dixon, 2012: 400). Generally, interrogative content words
specify a part of the proposition for which specific knowledge is sought (see §3.3.4). In
Murui, an interrogative content word occurs generally in the position of the omitted core
argument and it ‘replaces’ a core-argument in a particular functional slot. This is illustrated in
(11.34) where the interrogative bue ‘what’ appears in the position of an O NP argument. In
(11.35) it occurs in the VCC function.

name-CLF:INHER Q1
‘What is your name (lit. your name ‒ who)?’
The intonation contour of Murui content questions involves a high rising pitch (marked with
↗↗) on the first syllable of the content interrogative content word followed by a fall (see
intonation contour B1 in §2.4). This is illustrated in (11.36):

There is the same kind of intonation pattern as in negated content questions. An interrogative
content word that refers to non-core arguments is usually fronted and occurs in the clauseinitial position. This is illustrated in (11.37).

11.2.2 Polar questions
Polar questions are generally considered to be questions that seek an expression of
confirmation or negation of the questioned proposition (positive and negative polar
questions). Morphology and syntax of Murui polar interrogatives are identical to those of a
declarative clause. The only true distinction between the content and polar questions (beside
the absence of the interrogative content word) is the intonation: polar questions in Murui are
achieved by means of a sharply rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the predicate
(content questions have a high rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the interrogative
content word).
Any declarative clause may become a polar interrogative by using a subtype of a
rising-falling contour (B2) that involves a high rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of
the last word of a clause and is followed by a fall. There is no distinctive intonation
patterning between positive and negative polar questions. (11.38) is an example of the
positive polar question. The sharply rising intonation is over the verb jaai(de) ‘go’:

hungry-BECOME2-LK-2sg jungle.garden-LOC eat-NEG-LK-2sg
‘You are hungry, you didn’t eat at the jungle garden?’
Polar questions in Murui have a unique feature that other types of questions or any kind of
declarative clauses do not have. There is an optional omission of the verb inflection for the
3rd person, e.g. jaai? (go) ‘Did (he) go?’ and jaai-ñe? (go-NEG) ‘Didn’t (he) go?’ instead of476
the normal jaai-d-e? (go-LK-3) ‘Did (he) go?’ and jaai-ñe-d-e? (go-NEG-LK-3) ‘Didn’t (he)
go?’. All being the same, even in those instances, the intonation does not change.","[498, 499, 500, 501]"
"10.1 Negation ‒ general characteristics
Negation in Murui involves the morphological process of affixation, where a negative marker
is added to a corresponding positive in main and subordinate clauses. Negation of predicates
is expressed in two different ways: with the standard negative marker -ñe (slot 10 on the verb
structure, see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1) and with the negative attributive -ni ‘lack of attribution
(ability, property, possession)’ (slot 11, cf. the mutually exclusive positive attributive -re for
having ‘attribution (ability, property, possession’). The Murui negative markers with their
corresponding positive equivalents are illustrated in Table 10.1.
Table 10.1 Murui positive and negative markers
Positive Negative
–
-ñe
General
-re
-ni
Attributive
Compare the positive and negative constructions in (10.1a-b). The structure of ɨɨ(de) ‘swim’
does not differ from the ‘affirmative’ in (10.1a) with the exception of the addition of the
standard negative marker -ñe in (10.1b):430
(10.1) a. ɨɨ-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-LK-1sg
‘I swim’
b. ɨɨ-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-NEG-LK-1sg
‘I don’t swim’
Examples (10.2a-b) illustrate the positive and the negative constructions with the attributive
markers -re (‘positive attributive’) and -ni (‘negative attributive’) that follow the verbal root
ɨɨ- ‘swim’. Depending on the marker, they mean roughly ‘to have the ability to swim’ and
‘not to have the ability to swim’:
(10.2) a. ɨɨ-re-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-ATT-LK-1sg
‘I can swim (e.g. I am feeling healthy enough to swim)’
b. ɨɨ-ni-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-NEG.ATT-LK-1sg
‘I can’t swim (e.g. because I am sick)’
Depending on the word class they occur with, the attributive markers have different
semantics. They involve ‘ability’, as in (10.2a-b) above, but can also refer to ‘property’ and
‘possession’. The semantics of Murui attributive markers is outlined in Table 10.2.

positive attributive -re negative attributive -ni
VERBS
[+ ability]
[– ability]
ADJECTIVES
[+ property]
[– property]
NOUNS
[+ possession]
[– possession]Generally, the positive attributive -re, as in moko-re-d-e (green-ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) green’,
cannot be negated with either of the negative markers. The positive attributive -re occurs in
the same structural slot as the negative attributive -ni (see §3.1.3). Nowadays, younger
speakers of Murui occasionally negate the positive attributive -re with the standard negative
marker -ñe, yielding constructions such as moko-re-ñe-d-e (green-ATT-NEG-LK-3) ‘(it’s) not431
green’. Older speakers accept only negative constructions with the negative attributive -ni, as
in moko-ni-d-e (green-NEG.ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) not green’. The standard negative and the
attributive markers are used in slightly different environments. While the attributive markers
occur on verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the standard negative -ñe occurs on verbs and nouns
only (with adjectives, the negative attributive is used instead of the standard negative marker
-ñe). The occurrence of Murui attributive and standard negative markers with verbs,
adjectives, and nouns is given in Table 10.3 below.

See for instance example (10.3) below. Generally, negating clausal constituents other than
nominalizations is uncommon.
(10.3) [Kata [Maria dɨga]]S jaka bi-ñe-d-ePRED
Kata Maria WITH
never come-NEG-LK-3
‘Neither Katarina nor Maria came (lit. Kata with Maria never came).’
A constituent of a negated clause may bear additional stress. Additionally, the topical S/A
and non-S/A subject markers are present on a constituent that is in constrative focus. To
express meanings such as ‘it wasn’t the man we met, it was the spirit’ speakers say ‘we didn’t
meet THE MAN; we met THE SPIRIT’, as in (10.4) below (cf. jɨko=dɨ (dog=S/A.TOP) ‘dog’
in example (6.10) in §6.2.1.1):

(10.5) is an example of the nominalized clausal constituent ‘one who doesn’t talk’. Cases of
double negation within a sentence, such as in (10.5), are not too frequent.

‘I don’t know a woman who doesn’t talk.’uiño-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
know-NEG-LK-1sgIn Murui, questions differ from declarative and imperative clauses in both their intonation as
well as structure (see §11.2). The structure of some type of questions is unusual in that
predicate markers can be omitted for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural. Negative questions
with omitted predicate markers have different readings than their positive counterparts (see
§10.2.2). Murui has a single negative imperative (prohibitive) form, the standard negative
marker -ñe followed by the marker -no (see §10.2.3). Many of grammatical categories
available in positive clauses are available in the negative as well but there is some minor
degree of paradigmatic asymmetry between positive and negative imperatives. For instance,
the grammatical category of rapid action (used for immediate imperative meanings) cannot be
expressed in negative imperative. The language has two ‘privative’ markers -nino on nouns,
and -nino and -ñeno on verbs and adjectives (on verbs, -ñeno has prohibitive meanings, see
§10.2.3).
Murui lacks an independent grammatical word ‘no’; negative answers are expressed
by jɨɨ ‘yes, no’ followed by negated predicates instead (§10.3.1). 272 Murui has a number of
question words which can function as indefinites, such as ‘nobody/somebody’ and
‘nothing/something’. Their positive and negative readings depend on the predicate’s polarity
(see also jaka in (10.3) that can mean ‘always’ or ‘never’). The language doesn’t seem to
have inherently negative words. A few positive words however, such as mare ‘good,272Jɨɨ ‘agrees’ with predicate’s polarity and, depending on the context, can be translated as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’.","[454, 455, 456, 457]"
"11.2.7 Greetings
Murui has various kinds of formulaic greetings. Perhaps the existential verb i(te) meaning
‘exist’ is the most common greeting expression. It is used when passing somebody in the
village or when entering a house. It usually occurs with a kinship term. (11.52) is an excerpt
from a conversation:

something to eat or drink. The last who receives them, then always says (11.55-57):

While the declarative is the formally and functionally unmarked sentence type in Murui; the
imperative is formally and functionally marked. The interrogative is formally unmarked, but
functionally marked. Murui imperatives are either marked with a suffix or they can also be
expressed by verbal roots without any marking. Murui can express commands without using
dedicated imperative forms. Command-like meanings involve statements and questions, bare
nouns, inflected verbs in non-future and future tense. All types of Murui command strategies
differ in their strength. Murui distinguishes between content, polar, tag, and alternative
questions. All of these have some phonological and morphological properties characteristic of
them including different intonation patterns, presence of a tag and special kind of
morphological elision.","[504, 505, 506]"
"288Intonation being the main marking of polar questions (as opposed to content questions) is encountered inother languages from Amazonia, e.g. in Hixkaryana, a Carib language (Derbyshire, 1979, 1985).
289In many languages this is the case. As Dixon (2012: 389) put it: “(…) a person asks a question because theywant to know something. Polar questions and content questions are two ways of seeking to satisfy this want”.",[498]
"10.4 Summary
Murui negation involves the morphological process of affixation, where negative markers are
added to a corresponding positive in both main and subordinate clauses. Negation of Murui
predicates is expressed in two different ways: by the standard negative marker -ñe and the
negative attributive -ni for ‘lack of attribution (ability, property, possession)’. Murui lacks
independent grammatical words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’ (for which jɨɨ is used). Question words can
function as indefinites. Their positive and negative readings depend on the predicate’s
polarity.",[482]
"3.3.4Interrogative content wordsMurui distinguishes between content, polar, tag, and alternative questions. All of these have
some phonological and morphological properties characteristic of them, such as different
intonation patters (see §11.2). This section focuses on interrogative content words.
Murui interrogative content words fill an argument slot in content questions. There
are two free interrogative forms: buu ‘who?’ and nɨɨ ‘which?’. With classifiers (that occur on133In fact -ne in an unproductive locational suffix, which occurs with the demonstrative bene ‘here’, thepostposition dɨne ‘at’ (see §3.3.6), the interrogative nɨne ‘where?

number word da- ‘one, alone’, as in dane for ‘once (again, more)’.
134In the neighboring Kotiria (East Tucano) the O marker -re has also ablative meanings (Stenzel, 2013).",[191]

Focused clausal constituents in biclausal constructions are usually topicalized. In such
constructions topic markers occur on constituents of clauses with positive polarity (see
example (6.37) in §6.2.1.2).
There is a tendency for Murui negative clauses to show special syntactic properties.
While in positive declarative sentences non-subject arguments are optionally marked with
topical non-S/A subject -na (see §6.2.1), in their negative counterparts -na is almost
frequently present, as in (10.17-18) below.

pronominal subjects (see Table 7.1 in §7.1). In such cases nouns function as heads of
intransitive clauses, as in (10.19). Intransitive predicates can be negated with the standard
negative -ñe. (10.20) illustrates a negated predicate with the nominal head yofueraɨño
‘(female) teacher’.

For 3rd person singular, dual, and plural, identity is typically expressed by juxtaposition of
two NP’s, as in (10.21) (see also §12.1.1 on verbless clauses). As Murui verbless clauses437
cannot express verbal categories (such as tense or aspect) or negation, the only way to
express them is by means of negated intransitive predicates with nominal heads. Compare the
‘positive’ verbless clauses with the negated ones in (10.22-23):

10.2.1.2 Negative attribution
Murui negative attributive marker occurs on predicates whose heads are verbs, adjectives,
and nouns. Verbal roots that are marked with the negative attributive -ni have the meaning of
‘not having ability (to perform an action)’. In the following example (10.24), a small girl was
asked to go to the river to play. As she did not want to go, she answered:

However, Adriana was not home. Adriana’s father who lived close-by, answered:

The speech of some younger Murui tends to differ from that of Murui elders. To express the
‘lack of ability’ meanings, they negate the positive attributive marker -re with the standard
negative marker -ñe, as in (10.27a). Murui elders occasionally correct such usage by
employing the negative attributive -ni, as in (10.27b). (10.27a-b) is an excerpt from a
dialogue between a father and his son.
(10.27) a.b.gui-re-ñe-itɨ-kuePRED

‘I won’t be able to eat.’ (says a child)
gui-ni-tɨ-o!PRED

‘You won’t be able to eat!’ (the elder corrects his son)The attributive markers -re and -ni occur on all types of adjectives which function as heads of
intransitive predicates. They denote ‘(lack of) property, attribution’. The use of adjectives as
heads of intransitive predicates is de facto the most common way to express attribution in the
language (see §9.1 on verb-like and noun-like functions of adjectives and their ‘temporal’ vs.
‘timeless property’ semantics). (10.28-29) below are examples of the adjective rozi- ‘cold’
and ebi- ‘nice’ followed by the negative attribution marker -ni.

Those examples can be compared with the adjective kaɨma- ‘tasty’ followed by the positive
attributive -re in (10.30):
(10.30) [bi-e
yɨkɨ-aɨ]S eo kaɨma-re-d-ePRED
this.CTS-CLF:G fish-PL very tasty-ATT-LK-3
‘This fish is tasty (lit. having the property of being tasty).’
Occasionally, ebi-ni-d-e (nice-NEG.ATT-LK-3) ‘not nice, amusing’, as in (10.29), can also be
negated with the standard negative marker -ñe following the positive attributive -re. Uses
such as ebi-re-ñe-d-e (nice-ATT-NEG-LK-3) for ‘not nice, amusing’ are characteristic of the
speech of young Murui, and are considered to be incorrect by Murui elders.
Murui does not have a separate verb meaning ‘have’. As shown in (10.19) identity in
Murui can be expressed by intransitive predicates with nominal heads. This is further
illustrated in (10.31a-b).

‘I am a child.’
b. uru-e-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
child-CLF:G-NEG-LK-1sg
‘I am not a child (lit. I am non-child).’
The expression of possession in the language is similar to that of identity in that nouns
function as intransitive predicates. Such predicatively functioning nouns are marked with the
positive attributive -re to express ‘possession’ or the negative attributive -ni for ‘lack of
possession’ (see also §5.1.3). Compare the examples below:
(10.32) a. uru-e-re-dɨ-kuePRED
child-CLF:G-ATT-LK-1sg
‘I have a child (lit. I possess a child).’440

‘She is very poor (lit. having property of being poor). She’s got no house (lit. she
doesn’t possess a house).’
Although lack of possession is by default marked with the negative attributive -ni, younger
speakers tend to negate the positive attributive -re with the standard negative marker -ñe.
Compare (10.32-34) above with (10.35-36) below. There is no change in meaning between
(10.32b) and (10.35).

constructions. In (10.37) the head of the NP is bue ‘what’ (that consists of the interrogative
bound form buu ‘who’ accompanied by the generic classifier -e, see §3.3.4). This is similar in
(10.38) to the function of the ‘headless’ nominal modifier formed with the demonstrative bi‘this’ followed by the generic classifier -e.

10.2.1.3 Subordinate clauses
Murui subordinate clauses are negated in the same way as main clauses – by adding the
standard negative -ñe and the negative attributive -ni markers. All subordinate clauses can be
negated: the complement clause in (10.39-40), the purposive clause in (10.41), the temporal
clause in (10.42), the relative clause in (10.43), and all types of argumentative clauses in
(10.44-45).

Examples (10.46-48) illustrate the scope of Murui negation. While in (10.46) the standard
negative -ñe has scope over the main clause, in (10.47) its scope extends over the
complement clause. Example (10.48) is a case of ‘double negation’ where negation extends
over both the main and the complement clause. Double negative does not have positive

10.2.2 Negation of interrogatives
Murui negative interrogative clauses vary from one another not only in their structures but
also in theirdifferent expectations that speakers have regarding the answer. There are two
types of negative questions in Murui:
– those which have structures of declarative clauses (with interrogative intonation), and
– those which do not; they bear no predicative marking.
All types of negative questions can occur with either the standard negative or the negative
attributive markers. Positive interrogatives differ from the negative ones in their semantics.
While positive interrogatives are questions seeking information (‘Yes or no?’), negative
interrogatives presuppose negative answers. There is no difference between positive and
negative interrogatives in their intonation contour. They all have the rising-falling type of443
intonation which is characteristic to all types of interrogative clauses (see §2.4). Negative
interrogative clauses and their structures are discussed in turn.
A. NEGATIVE DECLARATIVE CLAUSES WITH INTERROGATIVE INTONATION – structurally, such
negative clauses do not differ from the plain negative declarative constructions. When this
type of negative question is used, there is a slight presupposition that the answer will be
negative. Compare the positive question in (10.49) with the negative question in (10.50).

In some specific context-bound situations, negative questions seem to be understood as ‘yes
or no’ questions. In the following example (10.52), Rata asked Maria to go and do something
together. Maria seemed to be quite sad that day, and Rata wanted to cheer her up:

B. NEGATIVE DECLARATIVE CLAUSES USED FOR 3rd PERSON WITHOUT PREDICATE MARKERS –
structures of predicates referring to 3rd person present a peculiarity – the omission of
predicate markers. They are used exclusively for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural, and are
marked with both the standard negative and the negative attributive markers. Such structures
do not differ in terms of their intonation from other types of questions. They always
presuppose that the answer will be positive. In (10.53), a woman asked her daughter to sweep
inside the house while she went to work. She came back a couple of hours later and upon the

Murui adjectives, comparative constructions, expression of equality, and similative marker
are focused on in Chapter 9.
Negation of Murui predicates is expressed in two different ways. There are two
negative markers: the standard negative marker -ñe, and the negative attributive -ni for ‘lack
of attribution’. Example (1.13) shows the verb fa(te) ‘hit’ negated with the negative marker
-ñe; in (1.14) the adjective kaɨma- ‘tasty’ is negated with the negative attributive -ni.

this.CTS-CLF:G fish-PL very tasty-NEG.ATT-LK-3
‘This fish is not very tasty (lit. not having the property of being very tasty).’
The (negative) attributive markers have somewhat different meanings in different
environments. With verbs they denote ‘(lack of) ability’, with adjectives ‘(lack of) property’,
and with nouns ‘(lack of) possession’. Murui lacks independent grammatical words for ‘yes’
and ‘no’. The interjection jɨɨ ‘agrees’ with the verb’s polarity, and, depending on the context,
can be translated as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Negation is discussed in Chapter 10.
Murui distinguishes between content, polar, tag, alternative, and exclamative
questions. All of these have some phonological and morphological properties characteristic to10
them (i.e. different intonation patterns, presence of a tag, and a special kind of morphological
elisions). All interrogative content words are based on two free forms: buu ‘who’ and nɨɨ
‘which, where’. To express meanings like ‘what’, ‘where’, and ‘when’, buu and nɨɨ take
classifiers, e.g. nɨ-rui? (Q2-CLF:DAY) ‘when (lit. which day)?’. Question words can also
function as indefinite words; their positive or negative reading depends on the polarity of the
verb, as in (1.15a-b).

Murui canonical and non-canonical imperatives are usually formally marked, and have
special paralinguistic features such as intonation, frequently accompanied by distinct facial
expressions. Murui has canonical imperatives (that is those which are directed to 2nd person)
and non-canonical imperative forms for 1st person (with hortative meanings). There is no
jussive for 3rd person. Imperatives can be marked with a special aspectual marker -kai which
follows the imperative suffix and indicates urgency and expectation of an immediate
response. Compare the examples below:
(1.16) gui-ño! (eat-IMP) ‘eat!’
(1.17) gui-ño-kai! (eat-IMP-RAPID) ‘eat quickly!’
Additionally, there are a number of imperative strategies, which involve among others future
event nominalizations, e.g. maka-ye (walk-FUT.E.NMLZ) ‘go walking (lit. future action of
walking)’. Murui questions and commands are discussed in Chapter 11.
Murui has an array of clause linking devices in main clauses and dependent clauses.
There are no ‘true’ relative and complement clauses but relativization and complementation11
and strategies. Murui sentence and clause types are focused on in Chapter 12.
Murui discourse is full of various types of repetition, many of which are used for
bridging (head-tail linkage). An example of a bridging construction is given in (1.18)
(bridging clauses are in boldface, reference clauses are underlined).

language change is discussed in Chapter 13.
This grammar is based on Murui as spoken in Tercera India, Amazonas, Colombia,
mainly by members of the Ereɨaɨ clan. The data was collected during fieldwork of 12 months
between 2013 and 2016 (see §1.7).","[33, 34, 35, 36]"
"11.2.3 Tag questions
Murui tag question are characterised by the presence of a special tag words erua meaning
‘really’. Among younger speaker of Murui, the form ua ‘really’ seems to be used
interchangeably but the form erua is nevertheless more frequently used as a tag word. 290 Both
tag words are added after a statement which has a normal declarative intonation. The tags
form separate intonation units, and have a sharply rising intonation. Murui tag questions are
generally used in positive polar questions when a speaker predicts that the statement is
correct and seeks agreement from the addressee. Examples of erua and ua are given in
(11.40-41) (see also T2.24 and T2.27 in the Appendix).

over from the preferred SV/AOV). Verbless clauses make no TAME distinction. They are
negated similarly to verbal predicates: an argument in the VCC function is used as a head of
an intransitive predicate followed by the standard negative -ñe and predicate markers.
Additionally, imperative markers do not occur in verbless clauses. Types of Murui verbless
clauses are discussed in turn.
E1. IDENTITY AND EQUATION ‒ verbless clauses expressing identity and equation are very
frequent in Murui. Examples of verbless clauses expressing identity and equation are given in
(12.13-14). VCC’s of verbless clauses correspond to S arguments of intransitive predicates
expressing identity.

‘I am Tadave (lit. my name - Tadave).’
To negate verbless clauses, the VCC argument of a verbless clause has to function as a head
of negated intransitive predicate, as illustrated in (12.16):

E2. ATTIBUTION ‒ attribution is often expressed through verbless clauses with adjectives
functioning as ‘headless’ nominal modifiers (see §9.1). Examples are given in (12.17-18).
Verbless clauses expressing attribution are negated in the same manner as any other types of

anaphoric reference to the R, as in (12.21) (see also §5.1 on the expression of possession).

12.1.2 Interrogative
Interrogative clauses have a typical rising-falling intonation (§2.4) as well as special
properties available to them (see the optionality of verbal marking for 3rd person in polar
questions in §11.2.2). Polar questions do not contain interrogative content words unlike
content questions; only one constituent of an interrogative clause can be questioned. Question
words (§3.3.4) can also be have indefinite reading; the value depends on the predicate’s
polarity. There are also a special type of a tag, alternative, and exclamative questions
(§11.2.3-5) which have certain phonological and morphological properties characteristic to
them (i.e. different intonation patterns, presence of a tag, and special kind of morphological
elisions). Gestures, such as raised eyebrows, wide-open eyes, eye contact with the addressee,
occasional lip pointing, generally accompany all kinds of interrogatives.","[511, 512, 513, 514]"
"477
Negative questions rarely occur with the tag words. When this happens however, there is no
change in their intonation patterns. The following example illustrates that the tag erua has the
same sharply rising intonation as the tag would have in any positive question:
(11.43) [Pedro nokae-do]INS jaai-ñe-dɨ-omoɨPRED ↗↗eru↘a?
Pedro canoe-INS
go-NEG-LK-2pl
see.really
‘You did not go by Pedro’s canoe, didn’t you?’
The tag forms erua and ua can also stand on their own. It is common to use both forms to
sustain conversations and let the speaker continue (see examples T2.15, T2.31, and T2.45,
T2.51, T2.70 in the Appendix and §13.3.2 on the use of ua in discourse).","[501, 502]"
"256
‘truly’ possesses the D; they are emphatic in nature. They are frequently used as answers for
the question bue (baie)? ‘what (is that)?’. Compare (5.87) and (5.90). (5.87) is a typical
verbless clause in Murui expressing identity; (5.87-90) are ‘possession’ verbless clauses with
the connective ie.

In verbless clauses with the connective following the R, the R can be a noun or a ‘headless’
nominal modifier, but never a 1st and 2nd person pronoun (as mentioned in §5.1.1.2, non-3rd
person pronouns cannot co-occur with ie), e.g. *oo ie jebe-gɨ (2sg CONN abdomenrdCLF:OVAL.BIGGER) is ungrammatical. 3person pronouns are always followed by ie, as in(5.91):

B. CONSTRUCTIONS WITH THE CONNECTIVE ie FOLLOWING THE R, AND THE D OMITTED ‒ in
constructions with the connective following the R, ie always refers anaphorically to the R, as
illustrated in (5.92). The D is omitted from the NP; in verbless clauses expressing identity it
can occur as the VCS argument, as in (5.93). Such constructions are the most frequent
answers to the question buu ie baie? ‘whose is this?’.","[280, 281]"

Structurally, negative interrogative corresponds to positive interrogative with omitted
predicate markers used for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural (see §11.2). Positive
interrogatives with the omitted predicate markers have the same ‘yes or no?’ readings as
those which bear such markers (see for instance (10.49) above). An example of a positive
interrogative with omitted predicate markers is given in (10.58).
(10.58) motoS
boo?PRED

If the answer to the negative question is negative, the independent word jɨɨ is stressed and the
predicate has a slightly higher pitch accompanied by a firm headshake (see §10.3.1).
Negative questions without predicative marking are commonly expressed with verbs as
heads of the predicate, as illustrated throughout examples (10.53-57). The omission of the
predicate markers on negated adjectives and nouns seems to be less common, but does occur.
An example of an adjective is given in (10.59-60) below. In (10.59), the adjective zefui‘bored’ is marked with the negative attributive -ni. (10.60) is expressed by a young Murui
speaker: the positive attributive -re is followed by the standard negative -ñe, cf. examples
(10.27), (10.35), and (10.36).

The occurrence of the standard negative marker on negated interrogative constructions
without predicate markers is unusual, but nevertheless, it does occasionally occur. Example
(10.62) comes from the negated declarative clause ‘it’s not a house’; the head of the negated
predicate is the noun jofo ‘house’, as in jo-fo-ñe-d-e (house-CLF:CAV-NEG-LK-3).

10.2.3 Negative imperatives
Although Murui has a number of imperative constructions (see also §11.1 on canonical and
non-canonical imperatives), the language has a single prohibitive form for the negative
imperatives. Murui prohibitive constructions refer always to the 2nd person, and are marked
on verbs by the standard negative -ñe obligatorily followed by the privative -no. With
adjectives and nouns, such structures have no prohibitive reading (see §11.2.3). The negative447
attributive that occurs in such construction has no prohibitive meanings. Examples of Murui
negative imperatives (prohibitives) are given in (10.65-66):

‘You cannot eat without your sister! Don’t eat!’gui-ñe-no!PRED
eat-NEG-PRIV.PROHThe prohibitive meaning is restricted to verbs only (such constructions have a special risingfalling intonation, see §11.1). With adjectives and nouns the meaning is strictly privative
‘without’. Verbs used in such construction can also have privative readings if they are not
accompanied by the rising-falling intonation, as in (10.69):
(10.69) maɨjɨ-ñe-no
bi-tɨ-kuePRED
work-NEG-PRIV come-LK-1sg
‘I came without having worked.’
The Murui prohibitive and privative can in fact be considered a special clause type of
privative nominalized clauses. Historically, the Murui prohibitive seems to have originated in448
the reanalysis of such clauses. The prohibitive might have been a command strategy at first.
That is, the privative was used to express prohibitive meanings. Synchronically, the privative
has become a major means of expressing the prohibitive in the language; it also acquired the
imperative-like intonation (sharply rising-falling intonation), which the privative does not
have. The privative has a normal declarative intonation.
Murui negative imperatives express fewer categories than their positive
counterparts. 277 While positive imperatives can take all aspectual markers and make
distinction between ‘delayed’ vs. ‘immediate’ imperative, prohibitives make no such
distinction (Wojtylak, 2016b). For instance, the only way to negate the immediate imperative
maɨnokai! ‘tie quickly!’ in (10.70) is maɨñeno! ‘don’t tie!’ in (10.71):

bi-ya
maɨ-ñe-no!PRED
quick-N.S/A.TOP come
this.CTS-CLF:CRAFT tie-NEG-PRIV.PROH
‘Come quickly! Don’t tie this boat!’
Negative imperatives involving adjectives have to take special markers with meanings of
‘become’ to occur in prohibitive constructions. 278 This is illustrated in (10.72) where a
woman ‘gave an order’ to a pot of soup she just cooked not to get cold:277This is congruent with Aikhenvald (2010). For instance, those Murui verbs that take the ‘terminative’ marker-bi, e.g. ikɨ-d-e ‘tell off (somebody)’ > ikɨ-bi-t-e ‘(s/he) was told off’, cannot be followed by prohibitive marker
(*ikɨ-bi-ñe-no!). The only way to express it is by ikɨ-ñe-no! ‘don’t tell (somebody) off!’. More work has to be
done to establish how the Murui imperative and negative imperative co-occur with such verbal markers.
278There is no difference between positive and negative imperatives with adjectives – all types of adjectiveshave to take the ‘become’ markers to occur in imperative constructions.","[469, 470, 471, 472, 473]"
"12.1.3 Imperative
The imperative clauses contains a verb marked with the imperative suffix. The imperative is
used only in independent verbal clauses. Compared to its positive counterpart, Murui negated
imperative shows additional morphological complexity, having a separate prohibitive marker
-no that obligatorily follows the standard negative -ñe. Positive imperatives have two
distinctions ‒ immediate and delayed; see §11.1; negative imperatives have one ‒ the
prohibitive. Imperatives express fewer grammatical meanings than do the corresponding
declaratives and interrogatives (such as the tense distinction). Constituent order in imperative
clauses is the same as that in declarative and interrogative ones (AOV/SV). This is illustrated
with the declarative in (12.24) and the imperative in (12.25):490

give12.2 Independent clauses and clause linking
Murui coordinated clauses express contrast/addition, and disjunction. Murui has also a
connector ie which functions as a textual anaphora and introduces main clauses by making an
anaphoric reference to some information given in the preceding clause (see §13.2.3).
A. CLAUSES OF CONTRAST AND ADDITION ‒ the linker iadɨ is expressed by two main clauses of
which the second is introduced by iadɨ ‘but, although’ and occurs in the clause-initial
position. Iadɨ typically has a contrastive meaning, as in (12.26-28) (see also example T2.27,
T2.37, T2.41, and T2.65). Occasionaly, iadɨ is interchangable with iadedɨ (a form of iadɨ
followed by the topical S/A subject marker =dɨ), as in (12.29).

Iadɨ is not always strictly contrastive. Its semantics appear to also cover such meanings like
‘so, even so’. Example (12.30) shows overlap with cause and result, followed by a purposive
clause (marked with the future event nominalizer -ye).

counterexpectation.

B. CLAUSES OF DISJUNCTION - disjunction in Murui is encoded with the linker oo ‘or’ in
alternative questions. 296 They are formed by a disjunction of two main clauses that share the
same subject (of which, the second clause is always negated; see also §11.2.4). The same
verb is obligatorily used in both clauses. The linker oo occurs in the clause-initial position
introducing the second clause. For example:
(12.32) PedroS bi-t-ePRED
oo bi-ñe-d-e?PRED
Pedro come-LK-3 or
come-NEG-LK-3
‘Did Pedro come? (lit. did Pedro come or didn’t (he) come?)’296As discussed in §11.2.4, the linker oo does not appear to be a borrowing from Spanish (the Spanish linker ofor ‘or’).","[514, 515, 516]"
"45811 Commands and questions
Statements, questions, and commands constitute the three main types of speech acts.
Declarative, interrogative, and imperative are the most common sentence types (also referred
to as a system of mood) that are used for expressing the main speech acts. Many languages
employ specific structures for these: declarative mood is used for statements, imperative for
commands, and interrogative for questions (Dixon, 2012: 376):

Ua can also mark a response, when the hearer is agreeing with the speaker. (13.33) comes
from a dialogue between two men about a white settler arriving to the Tercera India village to
buy some land. Ua is followed by the reported enclitic =ta.

In conversations, the intensifier ua is conventionally used with the interrogative intonation, as
a customary response to a question asking for confirmation. (13.34) comes from a
conversation about fishing. When a woman said that her husband came back from fishing,
another woman asked:

daughter that she caught four big fish. The mother is surprised because she knows that her
daughter does not know how to catch fish.","[559, 560]"
"10.3.2 Negative words
The interrogative content words buu ‘who’ and bu-e (Q1-CLF:G) ‘what’ that are used in
content questions (see §3.3.4 and §11.2) can have indefinite readings. If the sentence contains
a negative predicate, their meaning is ‘nobody’ and ‘nothing’; if the predicate’s polarity is
‘positive’, they mean ‘someone’ and ‘something’. Examples are given in (10.104-105). The
reference of buu ‘who’ is reserved only for human referents, bue ‘what’ refers to non-human
referents.

B. BARE NOUNS – this is a sort of directive one answers to promptly; it serves as a weak
command. Bare nouns seem to be highly elliptical directives, with omitted verb. For instance,
shouting dɨo-kaɨ! (tobacco-CLF:STEM) ‘cigarette’ when entering maloca at night, wanting to
be given a cigarette. The usual way is to ask dɨo-kai kue ine! (tobacco-CLF:STEM 1sg give)
‘give me a cigarette!’.
C. FULLY INFLECTED VERBS CAST IN NON-FUTURE TENSE – there are two types of verbs cast in
non-future tense that can express command-like meanings: those used for 2nd person where
the linker and the pronominal subject markers are fused, and those used for 1st and 2nd person
with fully inflected verbs.
C1. FULLY INFLECTED VERB AND REDUCED LINKER – such constructions have overtones of
kind advice when offering a delicate suggestion. They are used for the 2nd person singular,
dual, and plural, and are usually expressed with an intonation of a question. The syllabic
structure of the pronominal subject markers are reduced: -dɨo > -do and -tɨo > -to, as in atɨdo
‘bring’ in (11.28):470

firewood-CLF:G bring-LK-1sg 2sg bring-LK.2sg
‘I’ve brought the fire wood. Did you bring yours? (meaning ‘Go and get it now!)’
C2. FULLY INFLECTED VERBS – a fully inflected verb which normally serves as a predicate on
its own can be used as moderate suggestions for 1st and 2nd person singular, dual, and plural,
as illustrated in (11.29). Such clauses are usually accompanied by some paralinguistic cues
(e.g. eye gaze).

FILLER 1sg WITH
forest-LOC hunt.ANDTV-LK-2sg
‘Grandchild, you will go with me to the forest to hunt.’
D. FULLY INFLECTED VERBS CAST IN FUTURE TENSE – the future tense in Murui is not
exclusively used to indicate future actions or processes, but also to express deontic modalities
such as issuing requirements which must be executed at a later time (either in the immediate
or remote future). 287 There are two types of command strategies with fully inflected verbs
cast in future tense: those used for 2nd person where the linker and the pronominal subject
markers are fused and used for 1st and 2nd person with fully inflected verbs.
D1. FULLY INFLECTED VERB, FUTURE TENSE, AND REDUCED LINKER – such constructions have
stronger overtones than those of type C1-2, and are used for offering a stronger type of
suggestion. The pronominal subject marker on the verb is reduced -tɨo > -to, as in (11.30):
(11.30) beneLOC
ɨnɨ-itoPRED
HERE.LOC:NSP sleep-FUT.LK.2sg
‘(You) will sleep here!’287In Arapaho, an Algonquian language, future forms are not used to cast commands but to express “(...) arecognition of the strong authority of the person who cannot be commanded” (Cowell 2007:57).","[493, 494, 495]"

iv) the adjective mare ‘good’ is a frequent way to end a conversation, often followed by
dɨga-kɨno (MANY-CLF:STORY)’(there are) many news’ (see §3.3.6),
v) interjections such as jɨɨ used for confirmation ‘yes’ (similarly to that in the narratives, see
§13.3.1) and oo used as a response to someone’s call. In (13.28) Sandriela uses the
interjection oo to acknowledge Virgial’s call:
(13.28) Virgilia: Sama! (calling for Sandriela)
Sandriela: oo!
(used as a response)
vi) unusual intonation contour involving vowel centralization and vowel lengthening used
for long distance calling (see §2.4),
vii) unusual sounds such as ↓ɨh is used to express a sign of agreement and back channelling,
as well as surprise (see §2.7.3 and §3.3.7),
vii) frequent ellipsis of arguments (see §6.2 on argument omission and rare usage of clauses
containing two core arguments, and §4.5 on classifiers used as the main referent tracking
mechanism in the language),
viii) paralinguistic features, such as gestures and lip pointing (see §2.9),
ix) customarily, one will always ask questions (even when the speaker is fully aware of the
situation and the hearer is aware of this), rather than give statements. Murui people frequently
use this as a conflict avoidance strategy.
Conversations, especially those among younger speakers of Murui, are full of code switching
and code mixing (see §13.5). Texts 2 and 5 in the Appendix are examples of conversations.","[555, 556]"
"322
which cover speaker’s attitudes towards an event in terms of the desire, apprehension, and
ability to perform an action (attitudinal modalities, §7.2.3.1-2). Deontic modality is expressed
by means of a ‘dedicated’ future event nominalizer with obligative readings (§7.2.3.3) as well
as by imperative mood (§11.1). There are two epistemic modality markers: ‘unconfirmed’
and ‘confirmed certainty’, which cover speaker’s degree of confidence in utterance,
willingness to vouch for information, and the ‘attitude’ of the speaker towards that
information (§7.2.3.4).
Murui has a simple system of evidentiality with two choices available, ‘reported’
(formally marked), and ‘everything else’ (unmarked) (Wojtylak, forthcoming-c). 211 Murui
unmarked verbal forms typically refer to ‘unspecified’ information source. The meaning of
the reported evidential is hearsay acquired through someone else’s speech report. The marker
can be used in declarative and interrogative clauses but not in the imperative ones.
The system of mood indicates types of speech act (statements, commands, and
questions). It applies to complete sentences rather than only the predicate or a clause.
Grammatical categories of mood in Murui are not part of the non-spatial setting
specifications but they correlate to a certain degree. Depending on sentence type, there are
fewer distinctions in expressing certain grammatical categories. For instance, evidentiality is
not expressed in commands, and it rarely occurs in questions. Also, clause types and negation
can affect expression of certain grammatical categories on the verb. An example of this are
verbless clauses which cannot occur with any of the TAME markers (§12.1.1).","[346, 347]"

First and foremost, I would like to thank the Murui people of the Ereiaɨ clan of the Tercera
India community (Amazonas, Colombia) with whom I lived for over a year between 2013
and 2016, and who forged the deepest of ties with me over the years. My work on Murui
would never have been possible without Lucinda Rodríguez, kue ei, my Murui mother. She
taught me my first Murui words and has been patiently listening to me speaking Murui
komɨnɨ uai since my first fieldwork in Leticia, Colombia, in 2010.

I owe my deepest gratitude to my academic supervisors, Alexandra Aikhenvald and R.M.W.
Dixon, for their patience and constant support as well as their personal guidance that made
the completion of this thesis possible. Alexandra Aikhenvald has given me a vivid interest in
the Amazonian Linguistics. Her outstanding knowledge of the topic of the South American
languages (and beyond) has motivated and guided my work from the very beginning towards
the very end. At the heart of this thesis lies the monumental work of R.M.W. Dixon, Basic
Linguistic Theory. R.M.W. Dixon, a scholar of unparalleled knowledge of the world’s
languages, and a most generous mentor over the years.
I am grateful to all the members of the The Language and Culture Research Centre at James
Cook University: Elena Mihas, Mikko Salminen, Luca Ciucci, Lourens de Vries, Willem

Australia, but also elsewhere in the world in ways I had never expected. And to everybody
who has been part of my life in different ways. At times, we may be long distances apart but
eventually our paths always cross.
Thank you all, Kasiaxi

Chapter they are in (e.g. example ‘(1.5)’ refers to Chapter 1, example 5). Examples have
three lines. The first line is orthographic and breaks up each word into morphemes. The
second line shows morpheme-level glosses. SMALL CAPS are used for grammatical glosses.
Proper names are reproduced throughout the glossing. The final line provides a free
translation into English. The free translations are as idiomatic as possible; parentheses
complement contextual meaning of the free translations. If an example is to be found in the
text in the Appendix, it is marked with ‘TextNumber.SentenceNumber’, as in (T3.3).
In the text, verbs are given in a citation form, where the predicate marker (-dɨ/-tɨ) is
followed by the 3rd person pronominal subject marker -e. For instance, the verb ‘write’ is
presented as kue(te) ‘write’, where kue- is a verbal root. Punctuation depend on the pauses in
speaker’s speech after the sentence is considered to have been completed. Clauses and
sentences are not capitalized. When one word has several different meanings, the most
appropriate one is given in the gloss. ‘Headless’ nominal modifiers that are used as heads of
intransitive predicates are often shown in brackets to indicate non-verbal forms used
intransitively, e.g. [mare-ko]-d-e (good.ATT-CLF.REP.DOG-LK-3) ‘it’s a good (dog)’.
The quotation marks placed around the term Witoto are done at the request of the
Murui, Mɨnɨka, Mɨka, and Nɨpode people. ‘Witoto’ subsumed these four separate groups. The
term Witotoan refers to the language family (that consists of ‘Witoto’, Ocaina, and Nonuya).
Throughout the chapters, there are a few numbering gaps, as some examples were
eliminated in the final stage of the revision process.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

C. RISING INTONATION ‒ this is a special (non-canonical) kind of the intonation contour
pattern in Murui. It is mainly used when calling from a distance, or during festivities (for
instance, to announce somebody’s arrival, or gifts acceptance, and it is a usual way to bring
to an end traditional songs). 76 Calling from a distance can be considered a special speech
register, conditioned phonologically rather than lexically. A characteristic of this speechregister feature is a steep rise in pitch of the high central vowel ɨ that usually follows final
elements of a clause, as in (2.15-16) (see also §2.5.2 for more details on vowel change used
for calling from a distance). Its duration can lasts up to a several seconds. The high open
vowel ɨ is treated here as a prototypical vowel because it holds the syllable nuclear position.

Similar vowel centralization techniques have also been reported for other Amazonian
languages spoken in the area, such as Tariana (Aikhenvald, 2003). 772.5General phonological processesIn this section I will discuss a number of the general phonological phenomena associated with
articulatory processes in Murui which affect alternations of phonemes. They are divided into76These are a customary way of finishing traditional songs. They seem to be fixed expressions that containmany lexical elements from other varieties of ‘Witoto’, such as Mɨka or Nɨpode, which is suggestive of where
the Murui ‘acquired’ some of their traditional songs from.
77Vowel centralization used for calling from a distance is not uncommon. For instance, ‘call-at-distance’messages are shouted out among the Nungon speakers of Papua and New Guinea (Sarvasy, 2014: 122-124,
669), and are marked by an alternation of the final vowel of an utterance.","[120, 121, 122]"

demonstrative aki-, as in akie [a.ˈki.ɛ] ‘auditory’ < akɨ [a.ˈkɨ] followed by the connective ie
[i.ɛ]. Verbal affixes do shift stress; however in polysyllabic words, the secondary stress goes
usually onto the syllable that contains the linker -dɨ/-tɨ, as in:

‘I was the one who accompanied (them).’2.3Phonological word and phonological phrasePhonological word is the smallest prosodic unit in Murui. There are five main criteria for
recognition of the phonological word: stress (primary and secondary), formation of
diphthongs, vowel fusion, vowel reduction and consonant mutation. Primary stress operates
over one phonological word. In polysyllabic words (that consist of more than three syllables),
there is also the occurrence of secondary stress. Vowel sequences that form a diphthong
operate within a phonological word. They do not occur outside the phonological word
boundary. Phonological changes (vowel fusion) that occur as the result of morpheme
concatenation can operate only within one phonological word. With respect to consonant
mutation, the allomorphic difference between the predicate linkers -dɨ/-tɨ and -ka/-ga can
only occur within one phonological word (see §2.5). Phonotactic restrictions can also be used
to determine phonological words because certain phonemes are indicative of the beginning
and/or the end of the word. For instance, the phonemes ch and v occur only in word-initial
positions (ch can also occur within one affix: the classifier -chupi for ‘small house’). Other94
phonemes, such as b, cannot occur in initial positions of affixes on verbs, but they can do so
on nouns (see Table 2.2 in §2.1.1 that illustrates phonotactic restrictions on the occurrence of
consonants). Vowel lengthening is restricted to word-initial syllables only (see §2.1.2).
Phonological phrases, units that are larger that a phonological word, consist of a
number of phonological words that form one phonological unit. They bear the primarysecondary stress pattern of one phonological word, and cannot be interrupted by any kind of
pause marking. For instance, Murui possessive noun phrases form phonological phrases. (2.67) present instances of a possessive noun phrases in both the slow and the normalrapid speech
registers. The normal/rapid speech in (2.6) illustrates a weakened stress as opposed to the
slow speech register in (2.7) (both have the intonation contour of a declarative clause, see
also §2.4).

RISING-FALLING, and C. RISING. Additionally, there is a special rising intonation limited to95
certain situations involving calling from a distance. 75 Generally, the falling intonation is used
for declarative sentences. The rising-falling intonation is used for questions and commands
(see §11.1-2). The rising intonation is a special intonation contour used for ‘calling,
announcing’. The Murui intonation types are discussed in turn
A. FALLING INTONATION ‒ in declarative clauses and in commands. In declarative clauses, a
slightly rising pitch (marked with ↗) falls on the first syllable of the last word of a clause

"13.3.1 Narratives
Murui narratives are comprised of various types of traditional stories, such as the
performative genres rafue (ritual narrations that make reference to Murui norms and laws,
ancestral linkage, etc.) and bakakɨ (mythological narrations) (Echeverri, 1997: 30; Wojtylak,
2015a: 552). The rafue and bakakɨ narrations, unlike other types of genres, are monologues
told during evening gatherings at the communal roundhouses. They are usually told on
certain occasions. For instance, the elder Lucio Agga Calderón would narrate certain types of
normative rafue, whenever his sons would misbehave. Rafue narrations are meant to teach
about the ‘old’ ways of the Murui ancestors, and when told, they would always make a direct
reference to people’s current existence and practices. Bakakɨ, on the other hand, are
narrations about mythical animals, such as the possum jimenakɨ (see (2.1) in §2.1.1), or the
mythical heroes Jitoma and Kechatoma (see examples (13.2), (13.3) and (13.15) above).
Many of these stories have a morale. In case of the narrations of the journeys of Jitoma and
his brother Kechatoma, the stories tell about their wrong doings and subsequent punishments.
Rafue and bakakɨ are often cast in remote past, shown by the use of the remote habitual527
marker (see §7.2.2.4). Another type of monologues are the hunting narratives which use
hunting register (see §1.3.8), and chants (that have a special intonation contour and are
usually whispered).
The rafue and bakakɨ narratives usually start by introducing a theme of a narration,
and frequently use the verb yo(te) ‘tell’, as in (13.16).

§7.2.4). This is illustrated in (13.17), a continuation of the advice of the Grandfather Jobai to
Jitoma and Kechatoma in (13.15) above.

Perhaps one of the the most salient feature of Murui narratives, especially those of the rafue
type, are the sentence final markers jɨɨ ‘yes’ and jmm ‘hm’, followed by a significant pause.
An example of jmm is illustrated in (13.18) (see e.g. examples T1.15, T1.16, and T1.19 in the
Appendix).

‘Friends are given it.’
The interjections jɨɨ and jmm help the speaker to collect their thoughts and proceed with the
narration. Although the rafue and bakakɨ genres are primarily monologues, they do require528
active participation of those who listen. It is customary for men (or a specific individual who
the rafue is meant for) to vigorously respond jɨɨ, as a sign of acknowledgment of the elder’s
words. The interjection jmm is used for ‘less vigorous’ response (e.g. for instance when an
elder is scolding their sons). Occasionally, as a sign of agreement, the person who narrates
rafue, can use both markers, and continue with the narration. This is illustrated in (13.19).

It is also not unusual for the hearers to repeat a speaker’s last word, words, or even an entire

7.2.4.1 Reported evidential
The evidential =ta (slot 18) is used for reported information (with no reference to who it was
reported by; there is no distinction between second and third hand report). The expression of
the reported evidential is autonomous in that it is not fused with any other grammatical
category. Unmarked verbal forms typically refer to ‘unspecified’ information source, such as
common knowledge, with no overtones of any kind of ‘attitude’ of the speaker towards their
knowledge of reality. Compare the following examples where (7.133) relates a reported
information source while (7.134) is the unmarked neutral-form:

‘It is there (pointing at a plate in the kitchen).’ (neutral form)
The reported evidential =ta can also be used in some interrogative sentences. In the following
example, Tadave is narrating a story of how she came back from La Chorrera to San Rafael
being picked up by a man called Yonatan. She mentions Yonatan several times in her story.
Monica, who listens to it, asks for clarificaron with an echo question asking about Yonatan
and using the evidential =ta.

The reported =ta is not used in traditional stories; rather it is used to report an information in
everyday conversations (the quotative verb rei(te) ‘say’ or yo(te) ‘tell’ is used instead, as in
(7.134) above). Native speakers can easily reflect on the meaning of the reported evidential;
they usually explain it as ‘somebody said’ or ‘it is a comment’ (this is unlike the epistemic
modality markers which are ‘hard to explain’).
The reported evidential cannot be used with non-3rd person. In my collection of texts,
=ta occurs with 3rd person only. The reported evidential can be used with the futute tense
marker, as in (7.135) below. In this example, Tadave is repeating after her brother Walter.
The repetition is not entirely verbatim (‘put by me’ vs. ‘put by you’):

The reported evidential can also occur with desiderative modality. In the following example,
the dog Kodoro was in the maloca trying to steal a piece of meat. Ebe! Rɨakade! ‘Be careful!’
says Tadave ‘Kodoro wants to eat meat!’. Flor repeats this to others (the O NP is not stated):

In Murui, word final vowel centralization and vowel lengthening occurs in song-ending
formulae and fixed expressions uttered during traditional celebrations. They are also used for
calling from a distance, especially those calls that involve shouted commands. Such calls are
always accompanied by the special type of rising intonation contour (of the type C, see Table
11.1 and §2.4). Examples (11.24-25) show imperatives constructions used for calling from a
distance:

One can express commands without using dedicated imperative forms. Such non-imperative
forms with overtones of command-like meanings are referred to imperative strategies
(Aikhenvald, 2010). Although the use of imperatives is frequent in Murui, the language has
an array of ways to frame command-like meanings. Murui command strategies are discussed
in turn.
A. STATEMENTS AND QUESTIONS – these are statements which are treated as very weak
command-like suggestions. This is illustrated in (11.26), where a man came into the house
and, upon sitting down, said aloud that he has no money. The owner of the house who was
present at that point knew that he was supposed to have paid him a salary a few days ago.
What the man was doing in fact was asking to be given his wage.","[492, 493]"

1) When S/A marker =dɨ occurs on nouns, it occurs predominantly on S/A arguments. It can
also occur on other constituents that are topical but never on O NPS. This is illustrated in
examples (6.26-30). In (6.26) the S/A marker occurs on the postposition jira ‘reason’, in
(6.27) on the pronoun oo (2sg) in the S/A function, and in (6.28) on the adverbial jaie ‘(in
the) past’. In (6.29) it occurs on the linker ia ‘but’; in (6.30) it follows the adverbial
demonstrative bene ‘here’. 193

In (6.31) the marking =dɨ occurs on the question word (indefinite) buu ‘who’. The referent of
‘who’ in this context is specific, the Father Creator. Unmarked question words would have
‘general’ indefinite meaning, not a specific one, as in (6.71). This is similar to the differential193Murui verbs and nominalizations can be marked with =dɨ. They have additionally epistemic readingsreferring to certainty (somebody vouches for the information to be true) (see §7.2.4.2).","[302, 303]"
"102
future meanings. Reduplication of verbal roots that consists of vowels requires the insertion
of a glottal stop, as in ee~e(de) (cry~RED-LK-3) ‘crying (and crying)’.
D. VOWEL SHORTENING ‒ long vowels of certain verbs that refer to state and position, e.g.
jooi(de) ‘lie down’, tuui(de) ‘be open (e.g. rotten on the inside)’, fɨɨide ‘lie down (in a
hammock)’, boo(de) ‘burn’, raaɨ(de) ‘sit’, become shortened when followed by verbal
markers, e.g. bono(de) ‘set fire’, tuibe-d-e (open.plain.object-LK-3) ‘open plain objects’,
raɨnada(te) ‘sit down’. We observe the same process in monosyllabic nouns that contain long
vowels and are followed by classifiers, e.g. raa ‘thing’ > ra-be (thing-CLF:LEAF) ‘a leaf’. This
is not the case when monosyllabic nouns with long vowels are followed by case marking, e.g.
moo ‘father’ > moo-mo (father-LOC) ‘to the father’.
E. VOWEL CENTRALIZATION AND CALLING FROM A DISTANCE TECHNIQUE ‒ statements,
questions, and commands can be shouted out and used for calling from a distance. As such,
they not only receive a special rising intonation (see §2.4 on the rising intonation contour),
but also involve lengthening and vowel change of the final syllable in the clause, as in (2.28).
Words that end with the high open vowel i involve lengthening but no vowel change, as in
(2.29) and (2.30).
(2.28) ɨ, u, e, o, a > as in iñedɨɨɨ! (cf. i-ñe-d-e (exist-NEG-LK-3) ‘(there) is not!’)

omoɨS iiiii!PRED
good.ATT-N.S/A.TOP

‘(You) all be well!’ (cf. marena omoɨ ii)
In addition to being used for calling from a distance, vowel centralization can also occur in
other genre-specific contexts, as well as in various types of announcements, which are
typically shouted out, and apply to clauses that are understood as important. Clauses used for103
calling from a distance are usually short, and often comprise just one single word. 83 Vowel
centralization does not occur in everyday speech. An example of a call from a distance is
given in (2.31). A Murui woman went outside the house and shouted in the direction of her
jungle garden, where her daughters were working:
yɨkɨ-aɨO
roko-ye-zɨɨɨ!PRED
(2.31) bi-ño-kɨɨɨ!PRED
come-IMP-RAPID.CALL fish-PL
cook-FUT.E.NMLZ-CALL
‘Come immediately! To cook fish!’
(2.32) is an announcement during a traditional celebration ‘reporting’ that the mother’s
brother biyama is to arrive shortly. The nominalized biyɨ is altered by the further lengthening
of the central vowel to mark it as a special calling. This is illustrated in (2.32-34):
(2.32) biya-maS
bi-yɨɨɨ!PRED
mothers.brother-CLF:DR.M come-FUT.E.NMLZ.CALL
‘The grandfather will come!’ (cf. biyama biyɨ!)

(2.34) gui-yeS
i-tɨɨɨ!PRED
eat-FUT.E.NMLZ exist-LK.3.CALL
‘There is food!’ (cf. guiye ite!)
The high central vowel ɨ can either i) follow the final element of a clause, as in (2.32-34)
above, ii) be preceeded by an insertion of the apico-dental voiceless fricative -z, as in (2.35),
or iii) replace word-final vowels sometimes triggering alternations of preceding vowels, as in
(2.36-37). The duration of a call can lasts up to several seconds. The phoneme ɨ is treated
here as a prototypical vowel because it holds the syllable nuclear position.","[126, 127, 128]"

frequently as answers to the question buu ie? ‘whose?’. This is shown in (5.94), where Rata

pronouns, or the possession is marked by juxtaposition of possessor and possessed. A few
nouns, such as fueo-tɨ-mɨe (learn-LK-CLF:PR.M) ‘student (lit. (male) who learns)’, never seem
to be possessed. Elders prefer to say kue yofue-ga-mɨe (1sg teach-PASS-CLF:PR.M) ‘my
apprentice (lit. (male) who I taught)’. This is similar with gɨbokɨ ‘type of beetle’ disliked by
the Murui. One can possibly say kue gɨbokɨ ‘my beetle’ but people normally would not say
this ‒ why would one want to own a beetle? See also Aikhenvald (2012: 163-169).
Certain nouns, such as kinship terms, are more frequently possessed than others, such
as e.g. kue ei ‘my mother’, kue uzuma ‘my grandfather’, kue jiza ‘my daughter’, etc., but this
is only a tendency. A few nouns can have somewhat different readings when marked for
possession. For instance, when possessed, kaɨ uzu-tɨaɨ (1pl grandparent-KIN.PL)258
‘grandfathers’ can either mean ‘generation of our grandfathers’ or ‘our ancestors’. Another
example is (kue) moo ‘(my) father (vocative)’ and kaɨ moo (1pl father) ‘our Father Creator’
(see §3.1.1 on vocative forms). 181
Some objects in Murui cannot be envisaged as ‘ownable’ and, therefore, cannot be
‘possessed’ (see also §3.1.1). These are:
‒natural phenomena, such as jitoma ‘sun’, aifɨ ‘wind’, ukudu ‘star’, fɨvui ‘moon’,
ameo ‘rainbow’,
‒ proper names, such as Juziñamui ‘god’, Walter ‘Walter’,
‒ names of plants, such as ɨmokɨ ‘urtica medicinal plant’,
‒ some species of animals and insects, such as amana ‘dolphin’, uidodo ‘mosquito’.","[281, 282, 283]"
"5.1Possession ‒ general characteristicsMurui possessive construction involves the Possessor (R) which can be a noun, a ‘headless’
nominal modifier, or an independent pronoun, and the Possessed (D) which is frequently a
noun or a ‘headless’ nominal modifier, and functions always as head. Both the R and the D
can be modified by a demonstrative and an adjective. There is no marking on the R and the
D; they are simply juxtaposed within the NP with the Possessor-Possessed constituent order.
(5.1-2) are examples of a noun and a pronoun in the R functions:
(5.1) [LusioR yoe-faiD]NP
Lucio
metal-CLF:SHORT.THICKER
‘Lucio’s machete’
(5.2) [kueR yofue-raɨ-ñaiñoD]NP
1sg
teach-AGT-CLF:DR.F
‘my (female) teacher’
NP possessive constructions are marked in the same way regardless of the nature of R (that
is, R can be a pronoun or a noun (either a common proper, or kinship noun, with either
human, animate, or inanimate referents, loans, etc.) (see §5.1.2). Such possessive
constructions function as arguments of predicates, or head an intransitive predicate.
Verbless possessive constructions involve the R (and, often, the D) followed by the
connective ie that refers to the R anaphorically. Examples (5.3-4) are illustrative of this. (5.3)
is verbless possessive construction with the R and D elements expressed in the clause. (5.4) is237
a verbless possessive construction with the omitted D. Verbless possessive constructions,
such as (5.3), are frequently used as answers to the question bu-e bai-e? (Q1-CLF:G that.FSHCLF:G) ‘what is this? (lit. what - that)’ while constructions such as in (5.4) are used as repliesto buu ie bai-e? (Q1 CONN that.FSH-CLF:G) ‘whose is this (lit. who his/hers - that)?’ (see
§5.1.3.3).

Additionally, Murui has a construction which involves a morphological process of affixation
where the genitive -ɨe is applied to pronouns. Such form function as arguments of verbless
clauses; they can also head an intransitive predicate. The marking of the genitive is
conditioned by the Nominal Hierarchy, where the 1st and 2nd person pronouns (singular, dual,
and plural) in R function are marked with -ɨe, as in (5.5). 3rd person pronouns referring to the
R are marked with the connective ie, as in (5.6). The genitive marker is discussed in §5.1.1.2.

ANA.SP-CLF:PR.M CONNMurui lacks a verb ‘have’. Stating relationship of possession in the language is achieved
through predicative possessive constructions that involve markers on nouns and express
attribution or its lack (see §5.1.3.1), and the intransitive verb i(te) ‘exist’ where the R is
marked with the locative case (see §5.1.3.2). Another way to express possessive meaning is
through a verbless clause marked with the connective ie, as illustrated in (5.6) above (see
§5.1.3.3 for details).","[261, 262]"
"12.1 Types of independent clauses
Murui does not have separate morphological systems that would cover the declarative, the
interrogative, and the imperative. The three major speech acts ‒ statements, commands, and
questions ‒ are differentiated by intonation contours and presence (or lack) of certain special
markers. Constituent order does not correlate with sentence types in the language.
This section discusses independent clauses, which form a complete utterance in Murui;
this is unlike dependent clauses which are embedded within the main clause (§12.3).
Independent clauses are the declarative, the interrogative, and imperative. 293 There are a
number of declarative clause types which differ in their ability to occur with certain verbal
categories, especially tense, aspect, and evidentiality. Each clause type is discussed in turn.",[507]

B1. THE INTERROGATIVE CONTENT WORD nɨɨ can mean ‘oh what, where, how, which’. It
functions as a filler but has also somewhat demonstrative overtones referring to something as

Elsewhere in the grammar, nɨ- is a bound interrogative content word meaning ‘which, where’
(see §3.3.4).
B2. THE FILLER ñee is always used as a filler, that gives the speaker time while they get their
thoughts together. It is always occurs on clause boundaries and is followed by a pause, which
can vary in length. It is an independent phonological word, and can never occur as an enclitic.
An example is given in (13.53):541

While the valency-reducing mechanisms signal demoting an argument – the erstwhile
ambitransitive and strictly transitive verbs become strictly intransitive, valency-increasing
devices indicate that an argument has been added. Murui has one type of valency-reducing
mechanisms ‒ the passive (discussed in §8.1), and one valency-increasing mechanism ‒ the
causative and the double causative (§8.2). Murui reflexive and reciprocal constructions are
not valency-changing mechanisms (they maintain the clauses as transitive) but are included in
this chapter in section §8.3. The last section §8.4 offers a brief summary.","[395, 396, 397]"

jɨɨ 138 ‘yes, no’, jmm ‘hm’, and aa ‘ah’. They are used to express understanding or recognition,

that is used to respond to someone’s call. The sound ↓ɨh, used to express a sign of agreement
and backchanneling, is used primarily by older speakers of Murui. Another conventionalized
interjection in the language is aɨ ‘oh!’ that is used to express various types of surprise or
disbelief (it has no special phonological characteristics). The interjection oo is used to answer
calls, and the interjection ñee functions commonly as a filler that gives the speaker time while
they get their thoughts together (see §13.4). There are also interjections that are characteristic
to Murui songs, such as jii, juu, and jaa (§13.3.3). See also §13.4 on the attention getting baa.
Murui interjection stand outside the grammatical, phonological, or lexical system of

sounds that generally do not occur in the language, such as the pulmonic ingressive airflow

13.5 Contact-induced language change: Spanish influence on Murui
The ‘Witoto’ groups were contacted in the second half on the 19th century, in the first
instance by travellers, and later on, in the first half of the 20th century, by missionaries and
the rubber barons. The mostly violent contact with White settlers as well as military groups
started after the atrocities of the rubber boom period (see §1.3.2). The intensity of the contact
has resulted in a number of sociolinguistic changes among the Murui. They concern mainly
their attitudes towards their own culture as well as their language (§1.5). The brutality of
forceful ‘acculturation’ of the ‘Witoto’ peoples has resulted in many cases in their prejudice
towards speaking the Murui language. As a consequence, most of the Murui parents (those
who still have a good command of Murui), do not want to teach their children the language.
There is also many mixed marriages (such as between the Murui and the Bora) where wives
are not required to learn their husband’s languages anymore. In the last few decades, Spanish
has become the language of everyday life. This situation has resulted in the overall ‘language
shift’, which will possibly lead to gradual language death in the future.
Nowadays, there are no monolingual speakers of Murui in Colombia (in Peru, the
situation might be similar). Spanish is spoken by all Murui, and it is regarded as having
greater utility and prestige. Even Murui elders, most of who were brought up as monolinguals
in Murui between the 1940’s and 1960’s, have now a very good competence in Spanish
(Amazonian Spanish). Those elders were forced to learn Spanish in missionary boarding
schools (boarding schools were initially established as ‘orphanages’ for children whose
relatives died of small pox in the 1930’s) where speaking other languages than Spanish was545
forbidden and heavily punished (Bonilla, 1972). 320 Less than 30 years ago, in the most
remote Murui communities, there were still children who were brought up as monolinguals in
Murui. Only when they reached school age, would they begin to learn Spanish, that later on
would become their dominant language. While working among Murui communities between
2010 and 2016, I have not met a single child who was brought up monolingually in Murui; all
children are brought up in Spanish (nevertheless, the majority have some (mostly passive)
knowledge of the language). Some children from remote communities have a passive
knowledge of Murui, but only a few children are able to speak the language, all with
difficulty. Spanish is the dominant language in all areas of everyday life. This section focuses
on a number of contact-induced changes in Murui: those which occur under the influence of
Spanish (changes in grammar, §13.5.1), loanwords and calques (§13.5.2), code switching and
code mixing patterns (§13.5.3), and the ‘impoverished’ speech of young Murui speakers
(§13.5.4).","[567, 568, 569, 570]"
"3.2.1AdverbsMurui adverbs constitute a semi-closed word class. They are modifiers to verbs and
predicates (never used as predicate heads); the majority cannot take case marking (but some
can be marked for the topical non-S/A marker -na). The majority of Murui adverbs are of
adjectival origin (where deadjectival forms function like adverbs; these constitute an open
word-class); other types form closed word classes. Another distinguishing property of
adverbs is that they answer the question nɨeze? ‘how’, rather than bue? ‘what’ or nɨe?
‘which’ (see §3.3.4). Murui distinguishes between adverbs of manner and place. The
properties of the Murui adverbs are summarized below:

A. ADVERBS OF MANNER – on morphological grounds, adverbs of manner can be divided into
a number of classes:
A1. OPEN CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN MARKED WITH -re – most of
these manner adverbs are of adjectival origin (and as such can be used as heads of intransitive
predicates). They belong to an open class and cannot take case marking. This is illustrated in
(3.32), where the adjective jea- ‘dirty’, followed by the positive attributive -re, modifiers the
verb eruaɨ(de) ‘look’:

‘This (dog) looks dirty.’eruaɨ-d-ePRED
look-LK-3A2. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN (OPEN WORD CLASS) MARKED
WITH -re – a small group of adjectives, which have the positive attributive -re as a part of theroot (rather than a separate suffix, see §3.1.3), obligatorily take the topical non-S/A marker
-na in adverbial position. This is illustrated in (3.33), with the adjective mare ‘good’
modifying a verb.

‘My dog seems well (lit. good).’joruaɨ-d-ePRED
seem-LK-3A3. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN (CLOSED WORD CLASS),
UNMARKED – there is a small group of adjectival roots which can function as adverbs andquantifiers (see §3.1.3). These are komo ‘new (recent)’ and aiyo ‘big (a lot)’. Similarly to
other adjectives, they take classifiers to form ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, e.g. aiyo-ko (bigCLF.REP:DOG) ‘big (dog)’. Underived, they function as adverbs and quantifiers. This is140
illustared in (3.34-35) (see also §3.3.1 on the quantifier aiyo ‘a lot’). They can be further
modifier with the intensifier eo ‘very’.

very a.lot exist-LK-3
‘There is a lot (of it!)’
(3.35) komo
rii-d-ePRED

‘(He) has just arrived.’
Interestingly, when they take the generic classifier -e obligatorily followed by the topical
non-S/A subject marker -na, they can also occur in the adverbial position, as in (3.36).
Although there is no apparent difference between the aiyo and aiyuena, and the two
structures co-exist, among the Murui elders the underived form aiyo is used more frequently.

A4. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF VERBAL ORIGIN MARKED WITH -re – a small group
of adverbs of manner which have verbal origin. When marked with -re, they cannot take case
marking. An example of jarire ‘quickly’ (from the verb jari(de) ‘vapor’), is given (3.37).

‘My grandmother, after becoming angry, used to walk quickly (lit. like vapor) inside

A handful of lexicalized manner adverbs of verbal origin show some archaic derivational
processes which are synchronically not productive in the language. Such adverbs do not take141
-re, but the unproductive suffix -kɨ and the topical non-S/A marker -na. 108 Compare jarire
‘quickly’ in (3.37) with jarikɨna in (3.38). There appears to be no difference in meaning
between jarire and jarikɨna.

A5. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS WITH UNKNOWN ROOTS MARKED WITH -re – a small
class of lexicalized adverbs; their roots are no longer transparent and can be either adjectival
or verbal in origin (but not adverbial). They retain the positive attributive -re, e.g. raɨre ‘fast’,
and cannot take case marking. In (3.39), raɨre is modified with the intensifier eo ‘very’.

A6. CLOSED CLASS OF ADVERBS CONTAINING -ze – two manner adverbs that contain the
similative suffix -ze; these are: raize ‘well, correctly’, as in (3.40), and feekuize ‘slowly’.
They cannot take case marking.
(3.40) raize
yo-itɨ-o!PRED
well.SIMIL tell-FUT.LK-2sg
‘Tell (it) well! (lit. You will tell (it) well!)’
The suffix -ze is productive with nouns, and it has the equative-like meanings that refer to
size (see §9.2.6). Nominal modifiers with -ze have similative-like meanings, as in nɨ-e-ze (Q2CLF:G-SIMIL) ‘how?’ in (3.41) and bi-e-ze (this.CTS-CLF:G-SIMIL) ‘like this’ in (3.42). Such108The unproductive -kɨ might have been a classifier at some earlier stage. It is homophonous with the classifier-kɨ for ‘round’, ‘cluster’, and ‘inherent’ (§4.2.2.1). The topical non-S/A marker -na is multifunctional and is
used on various types of arguments (§6.2.1).","[163, 164, 165, 166]"

buy-DES-LK-3Murui nouns can take up to three suffix slots that generally can be filled simultaneously with
classifiers (up to three classifier positions), number (plural, kinship plural, and collective),
and case marking (topical S/A and non-S/A subject markers, locative, ablative, instrumental,
benefactive-causal, and privative) (see Chapter 6 on grammatical relations). The nonsingularity of plain noun forms is often determined by context. Often, number marking is
expressed when nouns are pragmatically salient or their referents are highly animate. Perhaps
one of the most salient features of Murui, is its large multiple classifier system, that consists
of more than 80 ‘established’ classifiers that denote among others, form, size, function, and
quantification. In this respect, Murui is similar to other neighboring languages spoken in the
Caquetá-Putumayo region as well as those languages spoken in the vicinity of the Vaupés
linguistic area to the north (among which the East Tucanoan and Makú languages, as well as
an Arawak language, Tariana) (Aikhenvald, 2000: 204-241; Seifart, 2005). A few examples
of Murui classifiers are given in (1.4) (classifiers are in bold).
(1.4)small, round in form e.g. komai-jɨ ‘seed of milpeso tree (Mauritia flexuosa)’
jiñi-jɨ
‘testicles’
tree-like form
e.g. ñekɨ-na ‘chambira tree (Astrocaryum chambira)’
zirɨko-na ‘grape tree’6
The classifiers are suffixes that can be defined as sets of morphemes used in various
morphosyntactic contexts, including demonstratives, pronouns, and adjectives, as illustrated
in (1.5):

this.CTS-CLF:COVER 1sg-GEN 1sg-CLF:COVER good.ATT-CLF:COVER
‘This (house) is mine. My (house) is a good (house).’The Murui multiple classifier system is semi-open due to the occurrence of repeaters which
can be defined as partially repeated nouns that do not classify nouns but occur in the classifier
slot. They have non-human referents only. In (1.6) -dora is ‘repeated’ from the Spanish form
komputadora for ‘computer’ on the pronoun oo ‘you (2sg)’:

B1. CODE MIXING AND INTERJECTIONS – the Spanish negative word no is frequently used in
Murui, as illustrated in (13.67). The positive sí ‘yes’ is almost never ‘switched’ (the
interjection jɨɨ! is used instead). 326(13.67) Monika:navui

Murui has a number of verbs which express similative and transformative-like
meanings. These are jaai(de) ‘go, become (in shamanic practices)’, i(te) ‘exist’, and janaɨ(de)
‘behave similarly’ (cf. izoi(de) ‘be similar’ in (3.79) and (13.21)). They are most frequently
used in the context of physical and spiritual transformations. The object of transformation is
always obligatorily marked with the topical non-S/A subject marker -na, as in (9.42):
(9.42) uzu-maA
janayari-naO
jaai-d-ePRED
grandparent-CLF:DR.M jaguar-N.S/A.TOP go-LK-3
‘Grandfather became a jaguar.’ (meaning: he transformed into a jaguar)

‘Alexis behaves like a chief.’ (meaning: Alexis behaves like a chief, but is not one)
9.2.6Similative and meanings of equal sizeMurui has a category which expresses the notion of ‘Y like/as X in terms of object’s size’.
The occurrence of the similative -ze is limited to nouns, demonstratives, the question word nɨe (Q2-CLF:G) ‘which (one)’, and the connective ie. 268 For example, ananeko ‘maloca
(communal roundhouse)’ marked with -ze has the equal size meaning of ‘an object Y being268The Murui simulative marker does not occur in other contexts such as nominalized verbs.","[449, 450]"
