"Asking location
An asking location suffix asks the location of a noun or pronoun it is attached to. The question
word ti ‘where’ asks the location of an action, and is not attached to any word.
In (AKT 18), the asking location suffix –ndi asks the location of the noun Kamalä ‘Camel’.
(AKT 18) (Asking location suffix; for noun)
Na Tumos kawung mänecce ka,
And Elephant came and was asking,
“Kamaländi?”
“Where is Camel?”
In (A&N 47), the question word ti ‘where’ asks the location of the action ꞌdox mas ‘you find
fire’.
(A&N 47) (Question word; for action)

suffixes in following lessons.
Identifying suffixes4 can be an equal sign in a sentence without a verb. In this way they help
identify or tell information about certain nouns. They can show the end of an identifying
relative clause (a group of words with a verb that tells which noun we are talking about). They
can also show a clause depends on another clause to make a complete sentence. They can also
show the end of a phrase (group of words without a verb) that is in focus, the most important
words of the sentence.
In (N&A 1), the identifying suffix –g on aminug ‘are friends’ is like an equal sign that shows
Nyaxolow na Apoco ‘Hyena and Hare’ are the same as aminu ‘friends’. It identifies or tells
more information about these particular nouns.

In the Caning language there are different types of words: nouns, verbs, prepositions,
pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and connectors. We will learn about these in this book. We will
also learn about how the words go together into groups of words called phrases, clauses, and
sentences. The words and how they go together are called grammar.
Learning about the words and groups of words in Caning can help you become a better reader
and writer. It is especially important for those writing books and translating Scripture to
understand the lessons of this book.
The lessons of the Caning Consonant & Vowel Book should be learned before learning from
this book. Most examples sentences in this book come from the stories at the end of this book.
Some words such as ‘consonant’ and ‘vowel’ are used in this book without being explained.
These words are explained in the Caning Consonant & Vowel Book. If you forget their
meaning, you can look them up in the glossary at the back of this book. There are many new
words in this book which are used to explain the grammar of Caning. Each new word is
underlined and explained when it is first used. If you later see the word and forget what it
means, you can also find it explained in the glossary at the back of this book.
This book can be taught to participants in a workshop. A person can also use this book to
teach himself/herself without a workshop or instructor. You should read each lesson and then
immediately do the exercise following the lesson. The exercise will help you test your
understanding of the lesson. The answers to the exercises are in the back of the book. After
completing an exercise, immediately check your answers to see how well you have understood.
For each of your incorrect answers, try to understand the correct answer. Ask other Caning if
you need help.","[3, 4]"

"But Fox himself surely had goal of indirectly
taking the meat for himself,

the cow, and pulled all of them,
those three, and they pulled (it) out.
Do not kill me,
for I am really not the one that killed the cow.
“Are you yourselves all fine?” King (said),
“Yes, we oursleves are all just fine.”
And they gathered all of them.
You know, there are storms coming
with rain and we need to tie
ourselves to the bottom of the trees.",[248]
"I am the king, I sent myself to
you to come.
You are stupid. Here is thing of sitting of king
which is you.
You go hide yourself so that you pretend to
catch Fox, but instead you will catch Donkey.
You were supposed to collect all the meat,
but you were not there.
Yes, I have come to your house today.
Father, my potential husband that I like,
he has come today.",[93]
"And they began on the way and they went
to the house of their elder sister.
And then she told her elder sister,
“Do you still (see) our person?
Didn‘t this guy eat all our elder sisters?”
And tears from their eyes came pouring out.
Bend over with your head and we will pour oil
into your anus so that you will be fat.
And the child of the Hyena responded saying,
“My mother killed my father.”
You cut out the liver for his hand.
You are saying there is a problem in his anus?
Hyena said to Hare,
“You are your body is good?” Hare said,
“Yes, I am my body is good.”
They were playing and his children
and he came and found (them) inside.
‘Tomorrow, he brings you to wrestling’
and (to) your brothers speak like this.
My father is stronger than your father.
And the children of Hyena went and
told their father.
You are an important king, where have
you come from? You have all your children.
Am I supposed to close my eyes and go?
Where is your mother?

2Boyeldieu, Pascal (2009) in Afrika und Übersee, 90:9-84 speaks of the noun unmodified form such as nyang
‘crocodile’ and the noun modified form such as nyangz- which includes the consonant z in this noun, but would
include other consonants for other nouns. In this way, the morphology is simplified a great deal. However, it
remains to be seen if Caning speakers think of the noun in this way since the ‘modified form’ of the noun is never
without a suffix. That is, it is not possible to say nyangz without adding additional segments. Thus, this book does
not compare modified with unmodified forms of nouns, and instead presents the morphology in a way that is
perhaps closer to the mind of the speaker.","[48, 49]"

He responded saying to her, “I am the one.”
So she sent him and advised him

meatIn the singular noun abad ‘stupid person’, the final d disappears when the suffix –tang is added
(abatang ‘It is a stupid person’). In the singular noun kaläg ‘amulet’, the final g disappears
when the suffix –kang is added (kaläkang ‘It is an amulet’). In the plural noun saxad ‘divorce’,
the final d disappears when the suffix –tag is added (saxatag ‘These are divorces’). In the plural
noun mag ‘tree sap’, the final g disappears when the suffix –kang is added (makag ‘these are

The most common singular suffix is –ang. However, singular complement suffixes can instead
be –pang when the final root letter is p, -cang when the final root letter is c, -tang when the
final root letter is d, and -kang when the final root letter is g. Singular complement suffixes can
be -ng when the final root letter is a vowel.

"In the following lessons, we will learn about each of these verb forms, one at a time.
Two types of verbs
There are two types of verbs that differ in prefixes and the changes of the first root consonant.
- 127 -Each can also have vowel changes in the suffixes.
Different prefixes
Nearly all verbs have subject prefixes that change with the subject pronoun before the verb.
The subject prefixes on incomplete verbs are different than on complete verbs.

theyAll verbs have the same subject prefixes in incomplete forms, but not all verbs have the same
subject prefixes in complete forms. There are two sets (groups) of subject prefixes in complete
forms of verbs. Some verbs (type 1) have complete form subject prefixes like mele ‘give back’
above. These include mägä-, cägä-, nyägä-, wagä-, sägä-. Other verbs (type 2) have complete
form subject prefixes like mene ‘take’ below. These include ma-, ca-, nya-, ka-, sa-.

theyIn the dictionary, you can tell the difference between type 1 and type 2 verbs from the complete
form. In the dictionary, complete forms are listed after the meaning in English and after the
command form.
mele1 v.tr give back mele, kämeley
mene1 v.tr 1) take, catch, hold, trap 2) care for mene/nang, kamen- 128 -The complete forms in the dictionary can be in the sentece Kig ____ (ꞌdog). ‘The person ____
(thing)’. Type 1 complete verbs in this sentence have the prefix kä- such as in kämeley ‘gave
back’. Type 2 complete verbs in this sentence have the prefix ka- such as in kamen ‘took’.
Consonant changes
In some type 1 verbs, there are changes in the first consonant of the root. In the type 1 verb
poko ‘carry’, the first consonant p changes to mp for the subject pronouns agä ‘I’, gi ‘you(sg)’
and angga‘you(pl)’ in both incomplete and complete forms, and for was ‘we (not you)’ in the
incomplete form.

"It is most common for plural complement suffixes to begin with –a-. However, plural
complement suffixes can instead begin with –ta- when the final root letter is d, -ka- when the
final root letter is g, -wa- when the final root letter is u or o, and -ya- when the final root letter
is i or e. Plural complement suffixes can be without a beginning consonant and a when the final
3Boyeldieu, Pascal (2009) in Afrika und Übersee, 90:9-84 considers all these noun forms to be unmodified and
without suffixes. That is, the various copulas are all separate words. However, since speakers do not think of these
copulas as separate words, and because there is some morpholophonology to support them as being bound to nouns,
this book presents them as bound (probably they are enclitics similar to the enclitic copulas of Gaahmg, another
Eastern Sudanic language.).",[51]

storyUsually a noun has two forms. For example, op ‘young man’ is the singular form used for one
person, and opiny ‘young men’ is the plural form used for more than one person.
There are three ways that nouns have singular and plural forms. They can add suffixes (ending
letters of the word) to the singular form as in uxic ‘worm’. They can add suffixes to the plural
form as in axiny ‘hut’. They can also add suffixes in both singular and plural forms as in
winic, wininy ‘vulture, vultures’.

"Verbal nouns
Verbal nouns are verbs that are used as nouns. They can be introduced by prepositions,
possessed, the object of a verb, or used in other ways as nouns. Most verbal nouns only have a
plural form which takes plural suffixes, but a few have both a singular and plural form. Many
verbal nouns have the suffixes –ad, ed, -id or -d, but some verbal nouns are without any suffix,
and are the same as the verb root.
In (T&A 6-7), the verb wuxi ‘drinks’ has the suffix –id. It is used as the noun wuxid ‘drinking’
- 171 -being introduced by the preposition tä ‘for’.
