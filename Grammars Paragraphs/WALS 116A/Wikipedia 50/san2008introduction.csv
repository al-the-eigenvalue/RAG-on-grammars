alternative interrogative pattern, in which the interrogative marker links alternate
propositions and is not necessarily reiterated sentence-finally.
11.1.3.3Yes-no interrogatives‘Yes-no’ interrogatives “seek a comment on the degree of truth of the questioned
proposition” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:178). Examples of Duna yes-no interrogatives are shown in (1026) - (1029), in which the interrogative marker =pe occur
on an otherwise declarative sentences. In Duna yes-no interrogatives typically have
a ‘positive bias’ effect, that is, anticipate a ‘yes’ answer that confirms the proposition. This is in contrast to alternative interrogatives (§11.1.3.4) which are typically
‘unbiased’.

11.1.3.4Alternative interrogativesInterrogatives in Duna that do not contain an interrogative pro-form are commonly
structured as ‘alternative’ interrogatives which “provide a list from which, the speaker
suggests, the right answer might be drawn” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:179). Two
(or more) alternative scenarios are presented in the sentence. =Pe indicates there
is a choice to be made between these scenarios, and is felicitously represented in
English translation as ‘or’. Examples (1030) - (1032) show interrogatives in which
two alternatives of differing polarity are suggested. In (1030) - (1032) the positive
iteration of the predicate is placed first, inflected and further marked with =pe. The
negative iteration that follows is derived with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3),
and is not marked with =pe. This is typical of ‘alternative polarity’ interrogatives
in Duna (see also Giles MSa:L5). An appropriate answer (as shown in the b lines
of (1031) and (1032)) usually repeats part of the original question.",[445]

In using the assertion marker a speaker effectively claims that he or she has epistemic authority in regard to the proposition. The marker is not strictly obligatory,
but there are certain circumstances in which it is expected. For example, in elicited
or constructed answers to questions (in which the predicate was inflected with a
compatible morpheme), speakers consistently judged that a sentence sounded better with =nia than without.
11.1.3
11.1.3.1Interrogative and speculative
IntroductionSadock and Zwicky distinguish the interrogative sentence type generally as that
which “signal[s] the desire of the speaker to gain information from the addressee”
(1985:156). I define Duna interrogative sentences as those that contain an interrogative word (§3.9)4 and/or the interrogative marker =pe (§11.1.3.2). They are derived
from declarative or optative sentences; in this section I exemplify interrogatives that
are derived from declarative sentences only, including three basic structures: yes-no
interrogatives (§11.1.3.3), alternative interrogatives (§11.1.3.4), and question word
interrogatives (§11.1.3.5).
Interrogative sentences typically function as questions. In prototypical question
situations the speaker: does not know something (or does not know it for sure),
expects the addressee does know it, and asks the addressee to tell them this information (or to confirm it). In some situations an interrogative sentence can be used
as a ‘rhetorical’ question, for which an answer is not expected. The speaker does
not ask the addressee to fill a gap in his or her knowledge, but may use an interrogative to convey an attitude (for example, surprise, criticism) towards a situation,
and/or draw the addressee’s attention to something (see, for example, (222)-(224)
in §5.3.3.2).
This section also describes a further minor sentence type, the ‘speculative’ (§11.1.3.6).
This type is defined on the basis of final predicate morphology, comprising those
4A possible exception to this is where interrogative words appear to be used in construction with
other morphemes as indefinite pronominals (see example (360)). Too few examples exist in the data
to pursue this issue further.","[442, 443]"

(738)ha-naAmbo neya=nia.there-SPEC PSNNOT= ASSERT‘That one surely isn’t Ambo.’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).1)
Neya can also constitute an entire utterance. In my conversational experience
‘yes-no’ and ‘alternative’ interrogatives (§11.1.3) are most commonly answered
with the verb of the clause (negated for a ‘no’ answer and inflected appropriately
for a ‘yes’ answer), but may also be answered with ẽ ‘yes/I agree’ and neya ‘no/not
that’. Neya can also be used to negate a proposition more generally; see example
(542) in which the speaker refutes a command.
In reported conversations in narratives it is quite common for neya to be spoken
once or twice at the beginning of a response to a question word interrogative, as
exemplified in (739). I do not know what factors determine appropriate use of
neya in this situation or how its meaning should be defined, beyond saying that it
functions as a kind of prelude to the answer.37 Perhaps this also assists in indicating
turn-taking when there is no overt marking of reported speech.

"11.1. Overview of sentence types415sentences that are marked with the uncertainty maker -rape (§9.3.3.2), or the epistemic particles =koae and =nokoae (§10.4.3). In these cases the marker =pe also
occurs, but is not really productively applied, as in the case of -rape it is represented
as a frozen component of the morpheme, and in the case of (no)koae is basically a
required element of independent use of these forms (unless an interrogative word
is present in the sentence). Speculative sentences are like interrogative sentences
in that the speaker expresses ignorance of the proposition, and encourages the addressee to have a look at what they know about it. However, unlike typical contexts
of interrogative sentences there is little expectation that the addressee knows the
answer and will be able to respond definitively.
11.1.3.2Question marker =peThe question marker =pe follows a final predicate in an utterance that is nonassertive and typically elicits information from an addressee, that is, has a question
function. The question marker may occur on verbal clauses as in (1023), and on
non-verbal clauses as in (1024). These are examples of a question word interrogative and a yes-no interrogative, respectively.

shown by (1025).

2SG eat-INT=ASSERT=Q* Will you eat? (CD/XIV:21)
The question marker may also occur as a phonologically free form, see (1036),
and can constitute an entire utterance. In the latter case, the interrogative marker
refers back to what has just been said, typically expressing the speaker’s interest in
and/or wonder at what the addressee is telling them.5

are derived from the application of an interrogative particle or clitic to a declarative
sentence, this marker is typically positioned sentence finally (especially in verb-final

Alternative polarity interrogatives such as those shown in (1030) - (1032) are
functionally akin to ‘yes/no questions’ in that they ask, is something the case? However, the scenario of this something not being the case is made lexically explicit in
the utterance; these examples are thus similar to ‘disjunctive-negative’ structures
(König and Siemund 2007:297) that occur in languages such as Mandarin.
Examples (1033) - (1035) show some further alternative interrogatives. These
do not offer two alternatives of differing polarity, but detail possible propositions
that ‘sketch’ (either more or less exhaustively) the semantic domain of the required
information. Answers are shown in the ‘b’ lines.

Example (1036) shows an interrogative with more complex alternative propositions. The form =pe is repeated as a semi-independent form in between the alternatives, functioning like a coordinating conjunction. This repeated semi-independent
use of =pe is common if the alternatives are contrasted but not really ‘parallel’ propositions (that is, they differ according to several parameters, as in (1036)), or if
more than two alternatives are listed. See also (603) in §7.5.5.2.

11.1.3.5Question word interrogativesInterrogatives may alternatively be ‘question word’ interrogatives (Payne 1997) that
contain an interrogative pro-form (§3.9). The pro-form stands for information that is
missing from the speaker’s knowledge of the proposition, and which the addressee
is asked to supply (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:185). Some examples are shown in
(1037) - (1041). Interrogatives that contain pro-forms may be marked with =pe,
as in (1038) and (1039), or not, as in (1037), (1040), and (1041). I do not know
what factors motivate this alternation, but the presence of an interrogative pro-form
means the sentences are formally interrogative and inherently question-like in either
case.6

6König and Siemund (2007:300) note that, although the application of an interrogative particle
would seem to be superfluous in constituent (question-word) interrogatives, it was nevertheless the
case that in approximately half of the languages they sampled, interrogative particles could optionally be added to constituent interrogatives.","[445, 446, 447]"
"9.3. Information status markers351The current data suggest that -ra is not generally used on final clauses in reference to events that happened anything more than a couple of days before the time of
utterance. Example (838) shows a sentence for which marking with -ra was judged
unacceptable, referring to an event of more than a year ago.49
(838)* alala no ho-ngako-ra-ngi,Hirandareke malifirst 1SG here-EXCV be/stand-SHRD-TIME PLNkuru-yamali.danceko-radance-DEP be/stand-SHRDWhen I was first here, [they] danced a mali at Hirandareke. (CED/VIII:95)
The question and answer pairs (839) and (840) illustrate that -ra is only suitable
if the predicated activity is to some extent already established as something that the
speaker and hearer know about. An answer to a fairly open question such as that
shown at (ko aki pope?) ‘what did you do?’ is likely to introduce an event that
the questioner does not know about, in which case it cannot be marked with -ra.
PK stated that a sentence such as (839b) would be unacceptable to answer (839a).
Example (839c), in which the verb is inflected as perfective, would be the suitable
response. However, PK suggested that (840b) would be a good response in the event
that Person A had previously asked Person B to plant some corn seeds, and seeing
them later in the day finds out from them whether they have in fact done so (see
§9.3.3.2 concerning the form -rape in this example).

RA judged this sentence was possible as an answer to the question ‘Who will go

"2SG.CS what kill.PFV‘What did you kill?’24The definition of left dislocation is confined by some scholars (see e.g., Foley 2007:443) to
describing constructions that involve copying. Left movement (and typically also broken intonation)
that does not involve copying may be referred to as ‘topicalisation’. However I do not use the latter
term for this as I use the word ‘topical’ elsewhere in a somewhat different sense, and because it seems
appropriate to use a single term for both construction types in Duna as they function similarly.
25
Thus, my use of this term is broad, and does not refer specifically to situations in which the
constituent in question is is represented by a pronominal element (or zero anaphora) in the clause,
and by an NP in the right dislocated phrase.
26
This is of course only observable if a constituent that would be predicted to occur before the
fronted constituent is present in the clause. For example, an object that is the only NP in a clause
will be clause-initial but is not ‘fronted’.
27
In this ‘answer to a question’ situation, there is a preference for fronted participants to be overtly
marked as indefinite with the quantifier ndu (see also §5.2.3.3). For example, when I first suggested
the constituent arrangement shown in (92), I did not have ndu within the instrument-referent NP, and
this was corrected by PK who thought that the sentence sounded much better with ndu included.",[150]
"1SG.CS go.PRES-SPEC say-PFV.VIS . P say-SPEC‘Now I am going [he] said it is said’ (T/PK:080605ii)
Contrastive focus is also suggested by RA and KK’s assessment of suitable circumstances for the constructed sentence shown in (422), in which the subject argument of a monovalent complex predicate (§7.5.2) is CS-marked. RA and KK
thought that this sentence could occur as an answer to a father’s question to his
daughters, ‘Which one of you girls will marry?’.

"‘Did I go there?’ (i.e., I most certainly did not!) (NEWAR: Hale (1980),
gloss added)
Duna appears to function similarly to Newar, disrupting the usual distributional
pattern of the intentive and prophetic inflections in interrogatives for rhetorical effect. Interrogatives formed in this way express strong doubt (yes-no interrogatives),
and/or suggest that there is no possible candidate to fill the ‘missing participant’ slot
(question word interrogatives). That is, the proposition is implied to be impossible.
For example, the (constructed) interrogative (1116) combines an addressee subject
with the prophetic inflection. My Duna consultant Timon Kangapu thought that
this could only be used in a situation where there speaker wished to imply that the

Hargreaves (2005).",[473]
"4.2. Participant reference in verbal clauses121I refer to copying and/or broken intonation of a leftmost NP, PlcP or PP as left
dislocation.24 Left dislocation is primarily associated with the pragmatic property
‘link’ (Vallduvı́ 1992) and the ‘re-activation’ of topical participants in discourse
(Lambrecht 1994; Foley 2007).
I refer to any right edge placement of a constituent that coincides with broken
intonation as right dislocation.25 Right dislocation is associated with clarification
and ‘tidying’ a clause that the speaker judges as confused or ambiguous.
4.2.4.2FrontingAn object or oblique may be fronted and occur first in the clause.26 Fronting typically indicates that a referring expression is pragmatically prominent and focussed in
some way. For example, the phrase may constitute information that fills a perceived
gap in the hearer’s knowledge; the fronted phrase is in ‘new’ (or ‘completive’) focus (Dik 1989:392). This is seen in examples (90) - (93) which show first a situation described in unmarked word order, and then three question and answer pairs
in which a missing participant is placed at the beginning of the answer sentence.
These sentences show fronting of an object NP (91), a PP headed by the instrument
postposition -ka ‘INSTR’ (92), and an NP marked with -ra ‘CNCL’ (93). PK judged
that these sentences would only be acceptable utterances as answers to the relevant
question.27

Example (1053) illustrates the fact that, like evidentials, the opinion marker =pi
(§10.4.2) also exhibits viewpoint shift, as in interrogatives this marker switches to
ask for the addressee’s opinion, rather than marking a stated opinion of the speaker.
(1053) epo=pi=pe.
raw=OPIN=Q‘Is [the fish you are eating] not cooked enough {you opine}?’ (LC/VIII:95)
Impersonal evidentials do not work in the same way as personal evidentials in
regard to viewpoint shift, and are appropriate to rhetorical questions or speculations,
rather than questions that expect an authoritative answer. Examples of impersonal
evidentials occurring in interrogative sentences are quite rare in the current data.
Unlike personal evidentials, impersonal forms do not entail a particular perceiver,
and so are not very suitable for situations where the addressee is identified as having
particular (and possibly exclusive) knowledge of the predicated event, as shown by
the awkwardness of (1054).

The formally interrogative sentences in (1055) and (1056) are used in situations
where the speaker encourages the addressee(s) to partake in co-assessment of the
proposition, without an expectation that he or she necessarily knows more than the
speaker. Both parties have access to the evidence in question.","[455, 456]"

to Aluni, a Duna area that is lower than Hirane (but higher and closer than Ekali,

(met on the road) is coming from. In this case other relevant context is that the

Unmarked potentially referential temporals such as day-terms (see for example

constrained by their meaning to occur as adjunct expressions in the clause; the major function of a word that denotes a period of time will be to describe the temporal
setting of a predicated activity.",[230]

"The way these features typically play out with respect to sentence types is shown
in Table 11.1.
Excepting interrogatives, Duna sentence types are here defined largely in terms
of the final inflectional or ancillary marker that occurs on the final predicate. The
presence of a certain morpheme in this position is regarded as a function/determinant
of the kind of sentence that it is. The correspondence between predicate morphology and sentence type is summarised in Table 11.2.

of truth and falsehood” and outline the general function of this sentence type as11.1. Overview of sentence types411Table 11.1 Typical features of sentence typesType

specificity marker -na; and the epistemic particles =pi and =pakapi. Most of the
examples shown in the sections that introduce the relevant morphemes are declarative sentences. Sentences headed by non-verbal predicates (either unmarked or
marked with one of the morphemes listed) are also declaratives.
It is a core property of Duna declarative sentences that they can be derived as
interrogatives, for example, through the addition of the interrogative marker =pe;
sentences which typically function to communicate substantive content can be transformed into sentences that seek (part of) the same content from somebody else.
A further typical (but not universal) property of predicate morphemes that occur
in declarative sentences is that in situations of emphasis they are compatible with
either the SPEC marker -na (§10.2.2, §10.2.4) or the assertion marker =nia. This is
true of all of the relevant TAM markers, the personal evidential markers, and the
relevant epistemic particles.2
11.1.2.1Assertion marker =niaThe bound form =nia (ASSERT) occurs finally on declarative sentences and marks
an utterance as an assertion.
Examples (1016) and (1017) show the assertion marker occurring on non-verbal
predicates.
(1016)no ima=nia.
1SG woman=ASSERT‘I am a woman.’ (T/YS:270205)
1Note that with regard to complex predicate morphology, it is the last morpheme in the sequence
that is relevant to this definition.
2
In the case of the individual standpoint marker -pa the situation in regard to this feature is not
clear (§10.2.4.4). Concerning the quasi-inflectional occurrence of the SPEC marker on independent
verbal clauses (§9.3.2.2), such verb forms are not further marked with =nia, and the question of
whether they are ‘compatible with SPEC’ is problematic; this would amount to asking if a morpheme
can be applied twice, something which has not been observed as allowable in any other area of the
grammar. Finally, the impersonal evidentials: these forms have something of a semantic/functional
incompatibility with either -na or =nia. The SPEC marker implies that the predicate refers to a highly
specific and individuated occasion, which clashes somewhat with the generalised and unanchored
perception denoted by the personal evidentials. Similarly, the assertion marker =nia basically marks
the speaker as an epistemic authority, and this is also at odds with the non-specific perceiver evoked
by the impersonal markers.","[439, 440, 441]"
"11.1Overview of sentence types11.1.1IntroductionSadock and Zwicky (1985:155) define the term ‘sentence type’ as referring to “a
coincidence of grammatical structure and conventional conversational use”. Definitions of sentence types are based on a correlation between typical functions (for
example asking a question or making an assertion) and the contrasting structures
of utterances that achieve (or are intended to achieve) these functions. König and
Siemund (2007:277) remind us that the illocutionary force (function) of a particular utterance is something that is negotiated between speech act participants in a
409410Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence typeparticular context, and cannot be precisely determined through reference to formal
properties only. However, structures that index sentence type do provide one kind of
signal of what the speaker wants the addressee to ‘do’ with the proposition encoded
in the utterance (cf. Weber 1986), for example, understand it as information that the
speaker has and is communicating to them (a statement), assess the proposition in
terms of his or her own knowledge and respond accordingly (a question), or bring
the denoted situation about (a directive).
I define Duna sentences as being one of six types: declarative (§11.1.2), interrogative, speculative, imperative, optative, or assumptive. Interrogatives are grouped
with speculatives (§11.1.3) and imperatives are grouped with optatives (§11.1.4), as
these sentence types have some formal and functional similarities and it is useful to
be able to discuss them together. The positive identification of assumptive sentences
as a unitary discrete type is somewhat problematic, and this is discussed in §11.1.5.
Four diagnostics that are used in defining the six sentence types are:
i whether the sentence includes an interrogative word (§3.9) and/or the question marker
=pe (§11.1.3.2). This is a feature of interrogative and speculative sentences.
ii whether the final marker on the predicate can be followed by either -na ‘SPEC’ or
=nia ‘ASSERT’ (§11.1.2.1). This is a feature that is typically associated with declaratives.
iii whether there is an assumption that the sentence has an addressee subject. This is a
feature of optative and imperative sentences.
iv whether the sentence can be (notionally) reframed as a sensible ‘twin’ counterpart
that has a different value with respect to being interrogative. For example, a declarative sentence can usually have the marker =pe attached to it, resulting in a corresponding interrogative sentence. This feature is characteristic of declarative, optative,
and interrogative sentences.","[438, 439]"

The data presented in (347) - (348) further illustrate the ‘concealed’ meaning
of -ra, and raise some questions about whose viewpoint the concealment relates to.
Example (347) shows a question in which the verb is marked with the visual evidential -rua (§9.2.3.3). As this utterance is a question, the understanding is that the
addressee is being asked about something he or she has seen (§11.2.2.1). In (347a),
the interrogative root pa- is marked with the place phrase marker -ka (§6.4.2), and
this represents a perfectly acceptable question. However, marking pa- with -ra in
this context as shown in (347b) sounds odd (KK & RA), as the notion of ‘concealment’ clashes with the overt identification of the addressee as a visual witness.

As a proper use of para, RA offered the sentence shown in (348), with the context that the speaker has gone to retrieve a kicked ball but cannot find it, and asks his
companions where it fell. However, I didn’t manage to establish a complete picture
for this hypothetical scenario (for example, does the speaker think his companions
can see the ball as he asks the question? Or does he assume that they can’t see it
either, but can point out the spot where it disappeared from view? Or doesn’t it
matter either way?). Further data are needed to achieve a better understanding of
how the use of -ra is sensitive to and/or constructs the shifting and/or sharing of
viewpoint between discourse participants.

"2SG mother here-TERR come-INT=Q‘Will your mother come here?’ (ED/VIII:23)

Using the intentive inflection suggests that the addressee (as informant/perceiver)
has a plan (in the sense of a mental model) of the queried event, and is in a good
position to provide information about it. This is a good functional basis for asking
a question. The prophetic inflection can alternatively be used in third person subject interrogatives when the speaker does not assume that the addressee necessarily
knows more than they themselves do; the utterance is more ‘wondering’ than ‘asking’. Prophetic interrogatives are thus functionally similar to speculative sentences
(§11.1.3.6) and interrogatives with impersonal evidentials (1055 and 1056).
The contrast between intentive and prophetic interrogatives with third person
subjects is illustrated in a comparison of (1113) and (1114). These examples show
two different ways of querying the destination of a third person who is about to
depart. RA suggested that (1113) would be used if the speaker has just seen the third
person pack up her belongings in the company of the addressee. The addressee then
comes over to the speaker who asks, ‘where will she go?’. The speaker anticipates
that the addressee is privy to specific information that the speaker does not have, as
it is likely the third person will have verbally explained or otherwise indicated to
the addressee where they are going. By contrast, the question shown in (1114) will
be used when the speaker and the addressee both observe the third person packing
her belongings, and neither party has better access than the other to knowledge of
the leaver’s destination.

(1114) pa-nanga-na=pe.query-SPEC go-PROPH=Q‘Where will [she] go?’ (I wonder) (CED/XIV)
The distribution of the intentive in interrogatives can be seen to correlate overall with the speaker’s judgment that the addressee (as the designated perceiver) has444Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence typebetter access than themselves to information concerning the proposition and is the
natural informant over and above others.27 In interrogatives with an addressee subject, the addressee is normally in a position to be the most authoritative informant,
as the person most fit to provide information about someone’s future activities is
typically that person themselves. In this situation, the intentive inflection is preferred. In interrogatives with a speaker subject, the intentive is dispreferred, as it
is odd to designate someone else as having ‘best access’ to information concerning
oneself. In interrogatives with third person subjects, there is usually an expectation
that ‘the addressee knows best’ (otherwise, why ask them) and the intentive is the
functionally unmarked form. Use of the prophetic inflection alternatively reflects
the fact that the addressee is not assumed to hold exclusive information concerning
the proposition, but may, like the speaker, be in a position to speculate about it.
11.2.3.4‘Impossible proposition’ interrogativesHale (1980) says that in rhetorical questions in Newar, conjunct and disjunct verb
forms follow the declarative rather than typical interrogative distributional pattern.
This is seen in (1115a), in which an addressee subject occurs with a disjunct verb
form, and (1115b), in which a speaker subject occurs with a conjunct verb form,
despite the fact that these examples are interrogative (as indicated by the marker
la). These sentences are not ‘true questions’ because they are not genuine requests
for information; rather, the speaker asserts that the proposition is not the case.

Example (1104) also shows the co-occurrence of a speaker subject and the
prophetic inflection in a declarative. This sentence is taken from a text in which the
speaker addresses her children, describing how her spirit will return to visit them
after her death. The speaker emphasises that her return will be witnessed whilst also
implying that this event is beyond the control of ordinary human agency.
(1104) ho-ngariya hoa-na=nia.here-EXCV return come-PROPH=ASSERT‘I will return here.’ (T/HS:080305iii)
Examples (1101) - (1104) illustrate some situations in which a declarative sentence with a speaker subject can be marked as prophetic rather than with the usual
intentive marking. See §11.2.3.5 concerning situations in which it may be appropriate for the intentive inflection to occur in declaratives with a non-speaker subject.
11.2.3.3Interrogative distributionIn this section I describe the distribution of the intentive and prophetic inflections
in interrogative sentences with addressee, speaker, and third person subjects. This
distribution attests a conjunct/disjunct pattern with respect to speaker and addressee
subjects. However, this is not maintained with third person subjects as in this case
the two inflections are used contrastively, the intentive being the more usual form.
The intentive inflection exhibits viewpoint shift (§11.2.2.1) between speaker and
addressee according to sentence type, whereas the prophetic inflection does not. Interrogative sentences inflected with -nda continue to locate a specific current perceiver, now identified as the addressee (instead of the speaker as in declaratives).
Interrogative sentences inflected with -na continue to evoke collective future perception; the addressee may be able to ‘comment on’ the situation, but they are not
appealed to as the single most relevant source of information.
Interrogative sentences with an addressee subject are inflected as intentive as in
(1105) and (1106). The speaker assumes that the addressee has a plan of their own442Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence typefuture actions, and use of the intentive inflection reflects this. Using the prophetic
inflection in this situation is extremely marked and to my knowledge only occurs in
rhetorical interrogatives (§11.2.3.4).

(1106)ko na-nda=pe.
2SG eat-INT=Q‘Will you eat?’ (LC)
The intentive inflection in interrogatives carries a strong implication of an addressee subject, as illustrated by the constructed example shown in (1107), in which
the missing argument is assumed to be a second person subject (compare to (1095)).
(1107)anoa na-nda=pe.
man eat-INT=Q‘Will [you] eat a man?’ (CD/2003)
Interrogative sentences with speaker subjects are usually marked as prophetic,
as in (1108) and (1109). Such questions are always somewhat functionally marked
as it is unusual for someone to make a genuine request for information regarding
their own actions (see also §11.2.3.4). As explained by Hale (1980:100) regarding
Newar, “the speaker cannot ask a true question about an action in which he portrays
himself as a voluntary instigator”. In (1108), a yes-no interrogative (§11.1.3.3), the
speaker queries a proposition over which she herself has little conscious control. In
(1109), a question word interrogative (§11.1.3.5), the speakers are trying to come
up with a way to solve a problem; they are not ‘voluntary instigators’ because they
don’t yet know what they’re going to do.

"42611.2.2Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence typeEvidential markersIn this section I outline the distribution of evidential markers in declarative and
interrogative sentences, with respect to the variable of subject identity. I focus on
the personal rather than impersonal evidentials, for reasons that are explained in
§11.2.2.1.
Evidential markers (§9.2) reference different kinds of information sources as
primary meanings. They are generally incompatible with speaker subjects in declaratives as it is unexpected (and in some cases incomprehensible) for someone
to describe their own actions through explicit reference to external evidence. Our
knowledge of our own activities is more substantially derived from performing them
rather than seeing or hearing about them. Evidential markers typically suggest that
an event is experienced by the informant (that is, speaker in declaratives, addressee
in interrogatives) as an observer rather than a willing participant, and this is illustrated in §11.2.2.2 and §11.2.2.3. Sections 11.2.2.4 -§11.2.2.6 describe some other
extended uses and implications of evidential markers.
11.2.2.1‘Viewpoint shift’ and evidential markersAs outlined in §9.2, evidential markers (excluding the impersonal forms) entail a
specific ‘perceiver’, the conscious entity that is understood to observe the evidence
in question. In declarative sentences, this perceiver is typically understood to be the
speaker. In interrogative sentences, this relationship shifts so that the perceiver is
typically understood to be the addressee; in asking a question, the speaker anticipates the kind of evidence the addressee will use in supplying an answer.16
This is illustrated in examples (1049) - (1052), in which the predicate rakare
‘cold’ is marked for current sensory evidence with the morpheme -yarua (§9.2.4.2).17
Examples (1049) and (1050) are declarative. The person who senses coldness or
heat (either of themselves or of a third person entity) is the speaker. Examples
(1051) and (1052) are interrogative, marked with =pe (§11.1.3.2). The person who
16In the textual data, it is rare for interrogatives to be marked for evidence, and most of the
interrogative examples in this section are elicited or constructed. The people I worked with had no
trouble interpreting or supplying ‘evidential questions’, but these are functionally and pragmatically
marked forms in that they reflect a narrow expectation the speaker has as to the way an addressee
knows about something; situations in which this form of presumption is appropriate may be quite
limited. Although the typical function of a question is to seek information, evidential questions
covertly assert (or at least suggest) something about the addressee’s mode of engagement with the
event that is being discussed. Presumably, this can itself has implications as to the responsibility the
addressee has for a predicate activity, or the veracity and reliability of their knowledge of it (see for
example (1061)). I do not address these issues explicitly in this preliminary study, but they are clearly
significant to a deeper understanding of ‘evidentials in action’. Another issue that requires further
examination in regard to viewpoint shift is whether or not this is a consistent feature of interrogatives
that are inflected with notional evidential markers (§9.2.6). There are too few examples in the current
data to be certain on this point.

"=3SG now RESTRICT come.PFV.VIS . P=Q‘Petros came just today {you saw}?’ (CD/VIII:8)
In keeping with a disjunct form distributional pattern (§11.2.1.1), evidential
marking may also occur on declaratives with addressee subjects, as in (1059) and
(1060), and interrogatives with speaker subjects, as in (1061). The latter situation
in particular is functionally/pragmatically marked, and may highlight the fact of
the evidence itself rather than of the predicate activity. Timon Kangapu suggested
to me that a question such as that shown in (1061) would be suitable for a court
dispute situation, in which the speaker refutes a claim by the addressee concerning
their (the speaker’s) activities. The interrogative is rhetorical as the speaker already
knows whether they went or not; this utterance questions the addressee’s evidence,
covertly asserting that the activity did not happen.

"‘[The pig] has perhaps gone {I opine}’ (CD/VIII:95)10.4. Epistemic particles397Overall, the distribution of =pi is such that it operates in functional opposition to
evidential and information status markers as a mediating form, and provides expression of a kind of epistemic assessment that is parallel to the domains of evidence
and information status.
10.4.3‘Hypothetical’ and ‘probable’ markersThere are three other bound forms that, like the uncertainty marker -rape, express
the speaker’s epistemic assessment of the proposition as something that is not necessarily true or known with certainty. These markers do not occur as primary
inflections on final verbs, but follow inflected verbal or non-verbal clauses. Further
investigation is needed to better understand how these forms contrast both with each
other and with -rape.
The forms =koae and =nokoae indicate that the speaker considers the proposition as hypothetical, denoting an event that is or could have been possible, but he or
she does not know how or if it actually happened or will happen. These morphemes
occur in speculative sentences (§11.1.3.6), and are always marked with the question marker =pe (§11.1.3.2) and/or include a question word. I do not know how
=koae and =nokoae contrast with each other (although it seems likely that =nokoae
is derived from =koae). Examples of these forms are shown in (992) - (997).

"11.1. Overview of sentence types11.1.5421AssumptiveAssumptive sentences include those with predicates that are marked with certain information status markers: the shared standpoint morpheme -ra (§9.3.3.1), dramatic
markers (§9.3.3.3), and the provocative inflections (§9.3.4). I call sentences that
are marked with these morphemes ‘assumptive’ because they signal an assumption
the speaker is making concerning the addressee’s state of mind, and express the
speaker’s ‘take’ on the addressee’s epistemic relationship to this proposition.9 For
example, use of the expective marker (§9.3.4.2) signals a speaker’s assumption that
the addressee has failed to consider the situation denoted by the proposition.
The illocutionary force of an assumptive sentence is complex. They function
somewhat like statements, in that they present the proposition as information that
is known to the speaker. However, each morpheme has further particular functional
characteristics. For example, the expective marker is typically used in obliquely
advising the addressee concerning a course of action, which relates to the function
of directive speech acts. The potential observation marker is typically used in trying
to extract information from the addressee, which relates to the function of questions.
In keeping with this inherent functional multiplicity, the way certain assumptive
sentences fit in with an overall formal classification of sentence types is problematic.
As can be noted from Table 11.1, assumptive sentences are basically defined negatively as those that do not show features typical of other identified sentence types.
They are grouped together as a collection of misfits that share some formal, functional, and semantic commonalities, but it is not clear that they represent a unified
category of their own, and in some cases there is evidence to support classification
as belonging to another major sentence type.
For example, the shared viewpoint marker -ra marks a proposition as somehow
familiar to both speaker and hearer. Such utterances are not typically informative,
as the speaker intimates that the addressee already has a pretty good idea of what
he or she is talking about, but they are assertive, and in this respect are similar to
declarative sentences. The shared viewpoint marker also appears to have a formal
property that is typical of declarative markers, the ability to be marked with the SPEC
marker -na. However, it is difficult to assess whether -ra shares the core property of
declarative markers, which is the ability to occur in interrogative sentences.
The marker -ra does not occur productively with =pe in interrogative sentences,
but this combination is represented in the fused form -rape that occurs in speculative
sentences (§11.1.3.6), so there is not really a clear answer to this question. Further,
9This is not to say that the use of other sentence types does not also involve making assumptions
about the addressee’s state of mind: this is a fairly essential tenet of talking to other people. However, assumptive sentences necessarily signify something quite particular about the nature of this
assumption, which is not generally the case for other sentence types.","[449, 450]"
"16Note also that the use of the prophetic inflection in questions generally signifies ‘diffusion’ of
information access, suggesting that the addressee does not necessarily know more about the questioned proposition than the speaker does; see §11.2.3.3. However, by further marking the prophetic
inflection with the sensory evidential, which does locate a particular informant, the questioners in
(931) manage to employ the most apposite future-time verbal inflection (that is, the prophetic inflection), whilst still maintaining the prophet’s ‘privileged access’ to knowledge of future events.",[413]
"‘Did you go there?’ (NEWAR: Hale (1980), gloss added)
Hale further explains that Newar conjunct forms are only used if the subject argument is also a “true instigator, one responsible for an intentional act” (1980:96).
For example, if a speaker does something accidentally, or is the argument of a nonvolitional ‘impersonal’ predication such as ‘come to know’, the verb will be disjunct, not conjunct (1980:96). Curnow’s subsequent work on Awa Pit expanded
the definition of ‘conjunct/disjunct’ to incorporate the fact that some systems are
also sensitive to the identity of an undergoer argument (Curnow 2002). Curnow’s
definition of the terms is as follows:
A language contains a conjunct/disjunct system if, given an agentive, intentional, volitional context (or a relatively neutral context with a verb that is
most commonly interpreted as an intentional, volitional action performed by
an agentive subject), statements containing a first person are distinct from
those that do not contain first person reference, while questions containing
second person are distinct from those that do not contain first person reference.
The marking used to distinguish first person in statements and second person in questions is the “conjunct”; the other form is the “disjunct”. (Curnow
2002:614)As already outlined in §8.2.1, Bickel and Nichols (2007) discuss conjunct/disjunct
marking in relation to the indexing of a role they term ‘informant’ (after Bickel
2001). A functional definition of informant is “the person whom the speaker supposes or claims to be the immediate supplier of the information” (Bickel and Nichols 2007:223).13 Typically, this is the speaker in statements and the addressee in
questions. As part of an agreement system, conjunct forms index the informant, and
disjunct forms alternatively index “any participant who is not the informant in the
speech situation” (Bickel and Nichols 2007:223). This definition of the informant
13Some issues concerning what is appropriately included as ‘the information’ are briefly considered in §11.2.4.2. For the time being, I focus on information as the propositional content of a
declarative sentence.",[453]
"Chapter 11Final morphology and sentence type
In this chapter I explore the meanings and functions of certain bound morphemes
(TAM markers, evidential markers, information status markers, and epistemic particles)
with respect to the illocutionary type of the sentence in which they occur. In particular, I look at differences in meanings and extended implications of predicate
markers that are associated with interrogative as opposed to non-interrogative sentences. The category of ‘interrogative’ is particularly significant to a discussion of
epistemic assessment (Chapters 9 and 10), because the typical speech act function
of an interrogative sentence is that of a question, and couching a proposition as a
question is expressive of certain ideas about knowledge and how it is differentially
distributed between speaker and addressee.
Section 11.1 gives an overview of sentence types in Duna, and introduces two
further sentence-final bound forms that are associated with declarative and interrogative sentences. In §11.2 I examine and exemplify particular features of predicate
morphology that shift according to whether a sentence is interrogative or not, focussing on the implications of certain final predicate markers as concerns subject
identity and volition. In §11.3 I provide an overview of issues concerning epistemic
assessment and the final predicate, drawing together material presented in this and
preceding chapters.","[437, 438]"

destination, and that sentence (1047) would be used if the speaker had forgotten the
date of the addressee’s mother’s arrival and was asking to be reminded of it.
(1046)Kipu pa-na
PSNngo-ra...query-SPEC go-SHRD‘Now where has Kipu gone again..?’ (CD/VIII:134)
(1047)ko antia paneki ho-ra...
2SG mother whencome-SHRD‘What day did your mum arrive again..?’ (CD/VIII:136)
The shared standpoint marker -ra thus groups with declarative markers in some
important ways, but not in others, because its semantics mean that it is not suitable
to typical questions.10
The situation is similar for other ‘assumptive’ morphemes. The dramatic markers for example indicate that the proposition communicated represents information
that is surprising and exciting. Sentences marked with these forms are functionally
very similar to typical declarative sentences in that they are informative; indeed,
most of the time the whole point of these markers is that they mark a proposition
as new information, presupposing that the addressee will be startled to hear of it.
However, unlike typical declaratives they do not appear to be marked as definite
with -na or as asserted with =nia, and there is no evidence that they can occur in
interrogative sentences.11
10This is somewhat akin to the situation with impersonal evidentials, which occur in interrogative
sentences that are speculative in function, rather than being clear requests for information that the
speaker does not have, and assumes the addressee knows; see (1055) and (1056).
11
I found that people did not typically recognise the dramatic morphemes as meaningful forms in
non-spontaneous contexts, and my attempts to pursue this issue through elicitation and constructed
sentences were unsuccessful. As regards the provocative inflections and interrogative possibilities,
data is also limited. Constructed sentences where these morphemes were followed by =pe were rejected as non-sensical. If we imagine that these inflections show a kind of viewpoint shift (§11.2.2.1),
that is, that the expected identity of an entailed perceiver shifts between speaker and addressee in
statements and questions, this rejection is understandable. For example, in non-interrogatives, the
potential observation marker identifies the addressee as a possible perceiver. In interrogatives, this
would (presumably) switch to the speaker as possible perceiver. However, it is difficult to readily
imagine a situation in which someone asks whether or how something has happened, while simultaneously making reference to the fact that they could have seen it happening. Similarly, a combination
of the expective marker and =pe would convey a meaning that could be paraphrased as something
like: ‘I (the speaker) am not paying attention to this event, and you (the addressee) think that I ought
to be paying attention to it’. However, the very fact that the speaker is asking a question about the
event denies the lack of attention that -nako suggests, so this is again hard to readily imagine as a
typical scenario.","[450, 451]"
"9.2. Evidential markers337evidential category.33
The kinds of evidential systems outlined above thus suggest a particular question concerning the Duna perfective inflection, namely, whether it is a semantically complex form that specifies both time and information source, and represents
a participatory and/or factual evidential category.34 If it were, this would allow an
analysis that evidentiality is an obligatorily marked category within a certain area of
Duna grammar (declarative sentences that denote past time events). However, while
it seems very likely that the perfective inflection at least implies participatory/factual
semantics as a consequence of contrast with other possible primary inflections, at
this stage there is insufficient evidence to claim that it actively encodes information
source and is itself an evidential marker.
In languages in which participatory and/or factual evidential markers occur, they
are members of a closed set of mutually exclusive morphemes that have information
source as a primary meaning. That is, there are compelling categorical reasons, as
well as semantic and functional motivations, to treat the markers in question as
evidential.
This is not so in the Duna case, as there are clear indications that while the perfective inflection contrasts with each evidential marker, it is not part of the same
formal set. As has already been mentioned, the perfective inflection has much more
restricted distribution than evidential markers, as it only occurs as a primary inflection on verbal predicates, whereas evidentials can occur as ancillary markers
with verbs (§10.2.3), and most can mark nominal predicates (§10.3). The evidential
markers as identified in §9.2 comprise a mutually exclusive set of forms that cannot
co-occur; however, many of them are attested occurring in combination with the perfective inflection (§10.2.2.5). Verbs that are inflected as perfective are commonly
further marked with epistemic particles (§10.4), whereas verbs that are inflected
with evidential markers typically are not, and in some cases are barred from doing
so (§10.4.2). A further significant point concerns the application of the assertion
33In the Oksapmin case, as described by Loughnane (2007), the participatory/factual evidential
is zero-marked in some person/aspect categories, and is also the inflection that can be most widely
used in more complex morphological structures. For example, a preverbal particle that encodes
inference can be used with a verb that bears a participatory/factual inflection, in which case the
information source meaning of this inflection is bleached. Thus, the participatory/factual forms are
the functionally unmarked way of expressing past tense in the grammar. Nevertheless, as argued by
Loughnane (2007), in view of the paradigmatic formal opposition displayed and contexts in which
the independent inflection is appropriate, the most sensible interpretation is that verbal markers
comprise a distinct evidential category—the participatory/factual—in these languages.
34
One alternative analysis would be to posit a ‘zero’ participatory/factual evidential marker. However this would not add anything to the present discussion, which is concerned with markers that can
occur as primary inflections. Such a morpheme would have to be defined as a marker that can only
occur in an ancillary capacity (Chapter 10), as it is not the case that a verb can occur as a final predicate in (apparent) bare root form, inflected with the postulated ‘zero’ participatory/factual evidential
only.","[365, 366]"
"346Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markerspendent but is part of a larger complex sentence structure; for example if the marked
clause bears a specific function in a matrix clause (cf. Bickel 1999:3), or is overtly
marked as a clause of purpose or reason (etc.). This is not entirely satisfactory, but
is adequate for my basic descriptive purposes.
It is of interest to note that the Duna use of the specificity marker on final
verbs in independent clauses shows some structural and functional similarity to
non-embedded nominalisations in several Tibeto-Burman language subgroups (for
example, Kiranti and Bodic), in which a morpheme that is used in nominalisation operations (and in some cases also functions as a singular definite article in
noun phrases) marks main clauses in attention-drawing, emphatic and/or ‘constative’ (“it’s a fact”) utterances.45 More generally, these ‘nominalisations’ are probably
examples of insubordination, the independent use of an apparently (or erstwhile)
subordinate structure (Evans 2007). Two functions of insubordination identified by
Evans that are of particular relevance to the Duna and Bodic examples are the expression of epistemic and evidential meanings, and the signalling of presupposed
material.
9.3.2.3Overview of the expression of present time eventsWe have now looked at the full range of known Duna morphemes that can occur as
primary inflections on final verbs in the expression of (non-habitual) present time
events, first introduced in Table 8.3 and reproduced here as Table 9.6.46 The group
includes three TAM forms (one of which is applicable to wa-class and consonantal
verbs only), four visual and non-visual sensory evidential markers, the individual
standpoint information status marker -pa, and specificity marker -na (the last two
being applicable only to regular verbs). The morphemes are formally and semantically disparate, but also functionally contrastive, and can be though of as providing
a speaker with a finite set of choices in regard to the (maximally simple) expression
of a situation that holds at the time of utterance.
45For example, in detailing the functions of nominalising morphology in Bodic languages (a postulated genetic grouping within Tibeto-Burman), Noonan (2008) notes that: “when nominalizations
[i.e., constructions headed by nominalisations or forms morpholgically identical to them] appear as
main clauses, the typical effect is one of mirativity, i.e. the sense that the predication so expressed
is in some sense surprising, contrary to expectation, or in some way exasperating”. In discussing
Kiranti languages (Tibeto-Burman), Bickel (1999) argues that the use of nominalisation markers on
non-embedded clauses represents a focus construction. Such constructions may be used in Belhare,
for example: “to instantiate a controversial discourse variable” (for example, in an utterance that
emphatically rejects a suggestion or insinuation made by an interlocutor); in the instantiation of an
open variable (completive focus) where “a speaker claims her proposition to be the definite answer
to the question”; or to re-instantiate a variable in narrative in order to “ascertain that the audience is
fully aware of the proposition and does not doubt it any further” (Bickel 1999).
46
The special present form of nga- ‘go’ (ngui) is not included in the array, as it is only applicable
to one verb. However, in relation to later discussion in this section, the fact that this inflection only
occurs in sentences with volitional informant subjects means there is a good argument to be made
that it encodes participatory semantics.","[374, 375]"
"280Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negationto be the immediate supplier of the information” (Bickel and Nichols 2007:223), and
with respect to different kinds of speech acts (that is, the informant is the speaker
in statements, the addressee in questions, Bickel 2007:2). My definition is tied to
formal sentence types of Duna (at this stage, declarative and interrogative) rather
than being completely functional.
One other obvious way in which subject identity is relevant to verbal inflection
is in the context of directive inflections. For example, verbs that are inflected as
imperative have an addressee subject by pragmatic necessity. Imperative sentences
usually occur as commands, and the imperative inflection is not used in interrogative
sentences, so a conjunct/disjunct pattern is not observable. However, the desiderative (§8.2.2.4), prohibitive (§8.2.4.2), and hortative (§8.2.4.3) inflections occur in
optative sentences (§11.1), which can be transformed into interrogatives (for example, with the addition of the interrogative marker =pe, §11.1.3.2). In these cases
we again see an alternation in correlations concerning subject identity that are dependent on sentence type, with the markers generally showing disjunct-like distribution. This is illustrated in §11.2.4; in this chapter I only discuss the use of these
markers in directive utterances and do not exemplify their use in questions.
8.2.2
8.2.2.1Semi-finite inflections
PerfectiveThe Duna perfective inflection (PFV) marks a situation that is viewed as a complete
event (cf. Comrie 1976). When a perfective verb form occurs as a final verb, this
indicates that this event has taken place before the time of utterance.12 With regular
verbs, the perfective inflection has the regular suffixal form -o or -u. Allomorphic
form is predicted by the final vowel of the verb stem. The suffixal form will have
the same [±high] value as this final vowel. Stems ending in /a/ and /e/ receive the
-o allomorph and stems ending in /i/ receive the -u allomorph.13 It is common for
the final vowel of the stem to be reduced or deleted (§2.1.4.4). Stems that end in /u/
or /o/ normally show a lengthening of the final vowel.14
12It would be possible to label the perfective and imperfective inflections (§8.2.2.2) as ‘past’ and
‘present’ in reference to their relative tense properties. However, using the terms ‘perfective’ and
‘imperfective’ both adequately defines the contrast distinguished and reduces the potential for confusion with time reference as it is expressed in combination with evidential and information status
markers. See also Comrie (1976:82-4) concerning systems in which “time reference [is] at best a
secondary consequence of aspectual distinctions” (1976:83).
13
This allomorphy is also described by Giles (MSa).
14
My current understanding is that the perfective suffix is pitch-bearing, but unspecified; that
is, that the underlying pitch specification of a verb is observable in the perfective verb form. For
example, the verbs ‘share’ and ‘fight’ have the same segmental content, /wei/, but contrast in pitch.
In the perfective form, wei-u ‘share-PFV’ shows a rising pitch contour, [lm], and wei-u ‘fight-PFV’
shows a falling contour, [ml]. I interpret this as an indication that wei- ‘share’ is specified for rising
pitch (e.g., an LH melody) and wei- ‘fight’ is specified for falling pitch (e.g., an HL melody).","[308, 309]"
"The term pikono may also be applied to narratives that are spoken, rather than
sung, but detail similar (less lengthy and complex) imaginative stories of a long-ago
time, where a hero or heroine encounters ogres and spirits. Spoken pikono is typically identified as a female genre (bedtime stories for children), and sung pikono
as a male genre. My textual data includes three sung pikono texts (one recorded
by NH and two by KG), which I give a distinct designation as ‘P’. Other narratives
that are potentially identifiable as pikono but which are spoken rather than sung are
designated as ‘T’. On some occasions I use utterances of audience members produced during a sung performance; these are designated PAR for ‘pikono audience
response’.
The textual data includes some material that was recorded in interview-like situations, with one Duna speaker questioning another on a certain topic. These are designated as ‘IV’. In some sections interviews are interpreted, in that KG or myself
asks a question in Tok Pisin, which is translated into Duna for the Duna interviewee
by the Duna interviewer, etc. Some other interviews are between a Duna speaker
and myself, so that the questions are asked (by me) in Tok Pisin and/or Duna, and
replies are made in Duna. I designate these as ‘LIV’ for ‘learner speaker interview’.33
After recording, the Duna text (T, P, IV, or LIV) would be transcribed by either
a Duna speaker, or myself in company with a Duna speaker (usually the latter). I
33I do not use my own attempted Duna utterances in interviews as example sentences unless they
are necessary as additional context, in which case their status as learner speech is indicated.",[52]

Example (910) is taken from a text describing the speaker’s childhood hanging

Examples (911) and (912) show the previous (rather than current) notional evidential markers following imperfective verb forms. In (911), a character in a story

with some surprise that they sleep in a house of this kind.

the visual completive evidential -tia being used in combination with an imperfective
consonantal verb, as shown in (913).
IPFV + visual or results evidential(913)nane hangoya-tia.boy there go.IPFV-PFV.VIS . P‘A boy is travelling there {we have seen}.’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).2)
It seems sensible to interpret (913) as an example of an ancillary (complex inflection) construction, indicating that an imperfective event has been visually observed, prior to the time of utterance. The event is non-stative (and so cannot be
appropriately described using the visual evidential -rua as an inflectional form).
Although this structure is attested in the textual data, I found that some speakers did
not find it readily interpretable in declarative constructed sentences, so it does not
appear to be highly productive.
One situation in which it appears more ‘natural’ to use IPFV + -tia is in yesno interrogatives (§11.1.3.3), as in (914). As is discussed in §11.2.2.2, the use of
evidential markers as final inflections in yes-no interrogatives is quite unusual; such
a construction effectively questions the addressee’s perception as much as the event
itself. This can imply doubt about the addressee’s veracity and the reliability of
his or her evidence, so that the interrogative functions as a challenging utterance;
see, for example, (1061). Using an evidential as an ancillary form in a yes-no
interrogative avoids this to some extent as it separates the event from the evidence.
The semi-finite imperfective verb identifies the queried event,8 and the ancillary
evidential suggests how the addressee could know about it.9
(914)ene koneporanda heya-tia=pe.true INTENS cannibal come.IPFV-PFV.VIS . P=Q‘The cannibal truly came {you saw}?’(P/AM:NH0312B)
Results evidentials may similarly occur in combination with consonantal imperfective stems in yes-no interrogatives, as in (916). KK suggested that this sentence
place but they have found it difficult. They don’t see the actual birds, they see the nests half done.
The two characters themselves see this, and the pikono teller reveals their thoughts.” In the final
sentence, Kenny is commenting on the fact that in narratives evidential categories commonly reflect
the viewpoint of major characters in the story, rather than the narrator.
8
A problematic fact for this analysis is that the inflected verb is imperfective, rather than perfective. For example, it seems that it would make more sense in (914) to use the perfective stem of the
verb, ho ‘come.PFV’, as the event that is being queried is (theoretically) completed, not ongoing. I
suggest that the suppletive visual forms of the consonantal verbs are originally derived from ho+tia
(etc.) and that it is no longer possible to ‘undo’ this morphological operation; in order to create a
contrast with the inflectional evidential the imperfective form must be used.

In Foe, evidential markers have distinct forms according to whether they are declarative or
interrogative (Rule 1977).","[405, 406, 407]"

Similarly, example (1122) shows a fragment of conversation (between myself
and two others) about whether or not a toddler would eat some food that I had
prepared. The toddler’s mother, Speaker B, replies to my question (1122a) using the
intentive inflection in (1122b). The other person, no relation to the child, repeats
the substance of the mother’s answer using the prophetic inflection as shown in
(1122c). I speculate that this reflects an understanding that the mother can ‘speak
for’ the child, whereas the other person does not claim this right. However, more
evidence is needed to test this hypothesis.

The use of the intentive inflection in examples such as (1121b) and (1122b) can
additionally be interpreted as relayed utterance, in which the speaker reproduces the11.2. Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity447speech or intention of a close associate with an assumed rather than overt ‘report’
frame.28
11.2.3.6SummaryOverall, the intentive inflection implies that an informant personally experiences an
event as an unrealised plan and is closely associated with the described situation.
Having a plan of something presupposes control (the informant is a volitional subject argument), desire (the informant wants the event to happen) and authority (the
informant has best access to knowledge of it). These features typically (and in some
cases necessarily) coincide, but may each be sufficient to independently motivate intentive marking in some circumstances. It is most usual (and always grammatical)
for intentive marking to occur in declaratives with volitional speaker subjects and
interrogatives with volitional addressee subjects.
The prophetic inflection alternatively draws attention to the actual manifestation of the event as something that will be perceivable in the future, and implies
disassociation from the described situation. The informant does not exert conscious
control over the event, and does not assert a relationship with the people involved.
This shows similarities to the disassociative implications of evidentials as described
in §11.2.2.6. It is most usual for prophetic marking to occur with third person subjects in declaratives, but it may also occur (without rhetorical effect) with addressee
subjects in declaratives and speaker and third person subjects in interrogatives.
11.2.4Deontic modality inflectionsIn this section I briefly outline the subject identity association of four TAM inflections that are particularly concerned with deontic modality: the promissive, hortative, prohibitive, and desiderative. These subject identity associations show some
relationship to conjunct/disjunct marking in that they change according to whether
or not a sentence is marked as interrogative.
Interrogatives formed with these inflections are questions of a sort in that the
speaker ‘requests information’ from the addressee. However, the information requested relates not only to the correctness of a suggested proposition or the identity
of an unknown participant (as in typical interrogatives), but also to the addressee’s
deontic attitude towards the proposition: are they happy for it to happen, do they
think it should happen, will they commit to bringing it about?
11.2.4.1PromissiveThe promissive inflection (§8.2.3.5) occurs with speaker subjects in declarative sentences, as in (1123), and addressee subjects in interrogative sentences, as in (1124).
28See also Ochs and Schieffelin (1984).","[475, 476]"
"50I suggest that this marker is originally derived from a combination of -ra ‘SHRD’ with the
interrogative marker =pe (§11.1.3.2); the fact that a proposition is marked as both ‘collectively
known’ and questioned means in effect that ‘nobody knows’. However, -rape is a fossilised rather
productively formed sequence, as neither of the posited components follow the distributional patterns
of the currently productive forms; e.g., the interrogative marker =pe does not precede evidential
markers in ancillary constructions, whereas -rape does (see Chapter 10).",[381]
"9.2Evidential markers9.2.1IntroductionIn this section I introduce the evidential paradigm and the semantic parameters that
it encodes, and provide examples of the evidential markers3 as primary inflections
on final verbs in declarative sentences (that is, broadly speaking, as they are used
in statements rather than in questions). The set of evidential markers as they occur
on regular verbs is shown in Table 9.1. See §9.2.8 for a summary that includes the
forms of evidential markers on consonantal and wa-class verbs.
I find it helpful to think of evidential markers as entailing a ‘perception event’4
in which a person (or other high animacy being) perceives the evidence in question
and/or becomes cognizant of the predicate activity. This is in accordance with Johansen’s (2000:61) definition of evidentials as presenting a situation “with reference
to its reception by a conscious subject”. An evidential marker in some sense ‘describes’ the kind of perception that is experienced (or thought to be experienceable,
see §9.2.7).
inflected perfective verb stem to which an ancillary marker is applied. Rather I interpret the use of the
o-base or u-base as a fossilised reflex of an erstwhile complex inflection that does not independently
contribute a ‘PFV’ specification (see also §10.5.4). So, the fact that the information status marker -ra
occurs on bare regular verb roots and the i-base form of wa-class verbs in the same semantic contexts
in which it occurs on the o-base of consonantal verbs means that I gloss the ngo in ngora as ‘go’, not
‘go.PFV’. The actual situation probably lies somewhere in between the two possible analyses. That
is, the selection of the o-base (or u-base) form is meaningful but is part of a conventionalised rather
than productively compositional morphological operation.
3
Giles (MSa) describes all of the bound forms I present in this section (with the exception of
those described in §9.2.4.4 and §9.2.7) as part of an overarching paradigm of verbal inflection for
which tense (past, present, future) is construed as the major contrastive parameter. Our conclusions
as to the semantic parameters that are contrastively encoded by evidential markers are thus different,
as are our ideas about how the markers fit into an overall system of verbal morphology. However,
my approach to investigating the meanings of these morphemes was substantially informed by her
earlier work.
4
This follows on from Kockelman’s (2004) discussion of evidential markers as disambiguating a
‘source event’ from a speech event.",[336]
"I assume that an NP in this situation bears a subject relation, unless context
clearly suggests otherwise. For example, if (89a) occurred as the answer to a question such as ‘Whose house are you going to?’ I would interpret no ‘1SG’ as a
possessor rather than a subject.
4.2.4
4.2.4.1Some marked word order/intonation patterns
IntroductionIn this section I exemplify some marked word order constructions in which the
ordering of subjects, objects, and obliques differs from the typical order shown in
Figure 4.2 (§4.2.2.3) in a systematically meaningful way. Marked constructions
typically involve movement of a phrase that is prominent in some way to the front
or back of the clause, where it may be prosodically marked as separate from the
remaining clausal constituents.
I define three features of these marked constructions: movement, copying, and
broken intonation. In some situations the features are codependent.22
Movement refers to the placing of an NP, PP or PlcP at either the left or right
edge of the clause, contrary to typical word order preference as described in Figure
4.2. Copying refers to the coreference of an initial or final constituent by a pronominal element within the clause. Broken intonation refers to distinct prosodic
treatment of the first referring expression of the unit, or of a post-verbal referring
expression. In the first case, the initial phrase is pronounced with rising intonation followed by a pause (‘comma intonation’), and there is thus an intonation unit
boundary between it and the clausal constituents that follow it. In the second case,
the right-moved phrase follows a predicate that is pronounced with closing intonation (distinguishing it from a clefted constituent).
I refer to left movement in Duna text that does not also involve copying or
broken intonation as fronting. Fronting is primarily associated with the pragmatic
property focus, and is only relevant to non-subject arguments, as subjects typically
precede other constituents in unmarked order.23
22For example, an object argument that is copied must also be moved (unless movement is a null
feature, for example, if the subject argument of the clause is elided rather than overt).
23
The fact that subject NPs generally occur clause initially suggests a default treatment of the
subject as a prominent participant.",[149]
"384Chapter 10. Ancillary final predicate morphologyI found one example in the textual data of -yarua following the prophetic inflection -na, shown in (931). This example is taken from a text that includes a description of pre-contact time, and recounts a prophecy that was made in this period
concerning a future kind of being that would arrive among the Duna. In (931), the
prophet is questioned by his audience. The audience treat the prophet as receiving
his knowledge through the sensory evidential category (see §11.2.2.1 concerning
‘viewpoint shift’ of evidential markers in questions).16

10.2.3.4Comment on -rape as an ‘extra’ formWhile evidentials can occur as ancillary forms following the uncertainty marker
(§10.2.3.2), the reverse order is not generally sensible. KK rejected the constructed
sentence shown in (932), in which a visual evidential inflection is followed by -rape,
as unacceptable.
(932)*ka-rua-rape
be/stand-STAT.VIS . P-UNC[It] was standing {I saw} perhaps. (CD)
However, there is one example in my data, shown in (933), in which -rape follows a visual evidential. This utterance is derogatory and sarcastic. The ‘addressee’
(not actually present at the time) is a woman who had promised to bring some
chicken eggs to the house. She did not do so, and later said (not in my hearing) that,
based on some visual evidence, she thought the chicken had been eaten by a dog.
The speaker of the utterance shown in (933) did not believe this excuse, but thought

The promissive inflection provides an addition to the quasi-paradigm of the intentive and prophetic inflections (§11.2.3) in terms of event actualisation and subject
identity. It combines the ‘certain manifestation’ implication of the prophetic inflection with the ‘informant control’ implication of the intentive inflection.
11.2.4.2Prohibitive, hortative, and desiderativeThe prohibitive, hortative, and desiderative morphemes occur as final inflections in
optative sentences (§11.1.4), exemplified in §8.2.2.4 and §8.2.4. These inflections
also occur in interrogatives that function as requests for permission or queries as to
what it would be best to do. Typically, the speaker asks the addressee whether he
or she supports an activity that the speaker intends to carry out. This is exemplified
in (1126) and (1127a) (with the hortative inflection) and (1128) and (1129) (with
the prohibitive inflection).29 An assent to a hortative imperative request is typically couched as an imperative (§8.2.4.1) as shown in (1127b). The prohibitive and
hortative only occur in yes-no interrogatives in the current data.

"5.3. Personal pronoun, PN, and interrogative NPs153A distinction between ‘close/present addressees’ (inu) and ‘distant/absent addressees’ (khunu) was also suggested in discussion with my Duna collaborators on
appropriate plural address terms. On one occasion when I asked about using either
inu or khunu in giving directives, KK and RA said these forms were basically interchangeable, but suggested that inu was more appropriate for giving commands to
a group of people that were nearby (see, for example, (200)), and khunu would be
used when shouting out a command over a distance (for example, from on top of a
hill). In talking over the two constructed questions shown in (208a) and (208b), PK
and KP initially said that they were ‘the same’, but added that (208a), in which inu
occurs, ‘includes everyone’, perhaps expressing a sense that inu maximally referred
to the present audience as an ‘in-group’, whereas khunu did not.

"448Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence typeAttempting to combine a speaker subject with the promissive inflection in a question as in (1125) was judged nonsensical (KK). The promissive inflection is only
used for informant subjects that are either making, or being asked to make, a promise concerning their own future actions. This matches the distribution of conjunct
subject forms.

11.1.3.6Speculative sentencesSpeculative sentences are those that are marked with -rape (UNC, §9.3.3.2), =koae
or =nokoae (HYP, §10.4.3). Speculative sentences are like interrogatives in that they
are always either include (a reflex of) the interrogative marker =pe and/or include an
interrogative pronoun. However, the interrogative marker is not really productively
applied. Removing pe (or replacing the interrogative pronoun with a noun) does
not result in a corresponding declarative or optative sentence. A speaker typically
uses speculative sentences as an invitation to an addressee to assess a proposition,
without necessarily expecting the addressee to be able to resolve the speaker’s ignorance or uncertainty concerning it. An example is shown in (1043).

In interrogative sentences with third person subjects, the distribution of the intentive and prophetic inflections does not match typical conjunct/disjunct subject
patterning, which would predict the prophetic inflection as the usual form (Table
11.3). Instead, the two forms are used contrastively. The intentive is the functionally unmarked inflection, exemplified in (1110) and (1111), and is also typical for
questioned subjects, as shown in (1112).",[471]
"964.1. Clause types97In the equational clause shown in (22) the two nominal phrases no rindi and
Paka are entirely coreferential, and maintain their equational relationship if the order of the phrases is reversed (see Dryer 2007a).2 In relationships of proper inclusion the predicate expression is non-specific as it describes a class. If the ordering
of the phrases in (23) is reversed the relationship changes to one of equation as the
predicate is now specific. Thus, the NP Mbara ima should also be marked as specific as in (24) (in this case with the specificity marker -na, §6.3.2.1) or there would
be an awkward disparity of referentiality between the terms.

A predicating NP may consist of an interrogative (§3.9), as in (26), forming a
question.

thiswhat say-SEQ‘What is this? [he] said...’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).1)
Equational or proper inclusion relationships expressed as clauses with nominal
predicates are usually understood to be immutable, and no time-frame is specified.
This contrasts with expressions of proper inclusion concerning mutable attributes,
such as a person’s physical maturity, which are normally denoted using an existential verb as a copula (§7.5.5.2). Evidential and information status markers in
non-verbal clauses can also specify a time frame for the predication to some extent,
albeit indirectly (§10.3).
4.1.1.2Adjectival predicatesAn adjectival root can occur as the predicate of a non-verbal clause, as in (27) and
(28), expressing an attribute of an NP argument.
(27)nane ha-nauka kone.boy there-SPEC long INTENS‘That boy is very tall.’ (CD/XV:5)
2However, the two possibilities are not equivalent in terms of information structure, as the reordered clause Paka no rindi is more appropriate to a situation in which we are being informed
about the place Paka rather than about the speaker’s homeland.

Although I have not tested this, it seems possible that example (25) could be acceptable as the
response to a question such as ‘Who is Fred’s wife?’; i.e., when the NP Mbara ima can be interpreted
as having a particular referent rather than being a generic term.","[125, 126]"

Figure 8.1 Final predicate morphologyAncillary markers follow inflected verbs or non-verbal predicates, and provide
further information concerning someone’s (typically the speaker’s) assessment of
the proposition encoded in the clause to which it attaches, for example, as something that is certainly the case, or as something that has been learnt thought a certain kind of evidence. In certain cases with verbal predicates the ancillary marker
combines with the primary inflection to form what I term a complex finite inflection. Otherwise, ancillary markers are optional extra forms that can be removed
with no consequences as to the grammatically independent status of the clause. The
occurrence of ancillary markers on final predicates is described in Chapter 10.
I identify four groups of bound forms that can be employed as primary inflections and/or ancillary markers on final predicates. These are: TAM markers, evidential markers, information status markers and epistemic particles. These groups are
primarily identified on a formal basis, with some input from semantic features. The
possible functions of TAM markers, evidential markers, information status markers
and epistemic particles with respect to the primary inflection vs ancillary marker
distinction are shown in Table 8.1.

ancillary markers onlyTAM markers (described in this chapter) encode features of time and ‘event
modality’ (intention, ability, obligation) as primary meanings. TAM markers are
contrastive, mutually exclusive, and only occur in the primary inflectional position,
that is, directly attached to the verb with no intervening inflectional morphology.
Evidential markers (§9.2) are a set of mutually exclusive forms that specify cer-8.1. Introduction269tain features of information source as primary meanings, indicating for example
that a situation was visually observed. Information status markers (§9.3) encode
features concerning (the speaker’s judgement of) what kind of knowledge the information represents, for example, whether it is surprising or self-evident. I refer
to the broad semantic domain encoded by these forms as ‘epistemic assessment’
(§9.1). Evidential and information status markers can occur as primary inflections
on verbal predicates, in which case they establish features of the verbal event’s actualisation and temporal status, as well as specifying meanings that relate to epistemic
assessment. The majority of evidential markers, and some information status markers, can also occur as ancillary markers, in which case they do not independently
determine time features of the denoted situation, but take scope over a proposition
that is already marked for temporal and modality features.
Epistemic particles (§10.4) only occur as ancillary markers. Like evidential and
information status markers, the primary meanings of these forms are to do with
epistemic assessment, relating to the presentation of a proposition as representing a
certain kind of knowledge, for example, a personal opinion held by the speaker.
8.1.1.2Primary inflections and the final verbBound morphemes that can occur as primary inflections on final verbs are listed in
Tables 8.2 - 8.5. A short description is included that outlines the typical import of
each morpheme when it is used in a non-interrogative sentence (roughly, a directive
or statement) as a primary inflection, and is not further followed by an ancillary
form.
The morphemes have been divided into separate tables according to the kind of
reference situation that they are typically used in. These divisions do not map exactly to the way that the morphemes are presented in this and the following chapter,
as the overall organisation of these chapters follows the TAM vs evidential vs information status marker distinction. Rather, the tables are provided here to give
an overview of the semantic range of markers that are in broad functional contrast
within parameters regarding the illocutionary force of the utterance, and the actuality and time of the event in question. Some issues concerning how these parameters
build functional paradigms of verbal inflection in Duna that cut across different
formal classes of morphemes are discussed at various points in this and the following chapter.
Tables 8.2 - 8.5 show those forms that are typically used as primary inflections
in statements, where a speaker tries to communicate the proposition of the utterance as something that can be treated as ‘information’. These are further divided
according to the relative time and actuality of the event in question, being classified270Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negationas generally referring to past (Table 8.2), present/habitual2 (Table 8.3), or potential time (Table 8.4). Table 8.5 shows those morphemes that are typically used in
directive utterances where the speaker tries to get other people to perform (or not
perform) the denoted action.
The inflections shown in Table 8.2 and Table 8.3 are drawn from the TAM
marker, evidential marker, and information status marker groups (shown in the table
in that order, divided by horizontal lines). Inflections that relate to potential time are
all TAM markers except for one information status marker, included in the bottom
row. Directive inflections are all classified as TAM markers.","[296, 297, 298, 299]"
"A sentence marked with -rape can function as a polite question, a hint that further information is desired from the addressee. See, for example, (840) in §9.3.3.1.
9.3.3.3Dramatic markersThe morphemes -raka and -rakunu/-rakuru (‘DRAMA’) are added to final verb predicates that describe past events and indicate that this event was (or is) surprising,
impressive, or contrary to expectations. I do not know what contrasts the three different forms express. The dramatic markers are added to the o-base of consonantal
verbs and, according to the very limited data available, to the i-base of wa-class
verbs and the a-base of partial members of the wa-class group. There is no evidence that the dramatic markers can occur as ancillary markers; in my data they are
only used as inflectional forms. Further data and analysis are required to better understand the meanings of the dramatic markers and the range of structures they may
occur in.
An example of -raka is shown in (845), taken from a story in which two women
are busy eating and are unaware that two men are approaching until they are suddenly upon them. The final verb kundu- refers to a loud noise. It is noticeable that
-raka and rakur(/n)u often mark noisy events.

"366Chapter 10. Ancillary final predicate morphologythe time of perception (cf. the discussion of the Matses ‘double tense’ system in
§9.2.2.3). Information status forms also show a shift in (implicational) meaning, as
when they occur as terminal final inflections they supply an absolute time value for
the predicated event (§9.3), but when they occur as ancillary markers they do not.
As a general rule, complex inflections fill gaps in the inflectional system with
respect to certain combinations of time, event modality and epistemic assessment
features. For example, as a primary inflection, the information status marker -rape
is used to express an assessment of uncertainty concerning an event that may have
happened in the past. However, there is no single morpheme that expresses an
assessment of uncertainty concerning an event that may happen in the future.2 A
complex inflection can be constructed to combine these features using the intentive
inflection -nda (‘future time’), followed by -rape (‘uncertain’) as an ancillary form.
Attested complex inflections and an approximation of their meanings (in statements,
unless otherwise indicated) are summarised in Table 10.2.
