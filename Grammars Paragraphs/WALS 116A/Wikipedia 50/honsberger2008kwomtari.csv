Prohibitives can be directed at either a second or third person. The prohibitive
markers are kose ‘lest’ initially, and mani ‘PHB’ finally.2 They are associated with
status marking appropriate to the context. Appropriate status subject markers are used
for the circumstance, i.e. irrealis for something that hasn’t been done. Second person
prohibitives are normally realis. This may be because they are directed to a person
involved in doing or about to do the forbidden activity. All other examples of
negative imperatives in the current data corpus are irrealis.

9.4.1 Question words
Three bases are used in formation of question words: ake, gle and ine. Suffixes
are freely added to these bases to form the question words.
The basic meaning of ake is ‘how’. It contains the two morphemes a ‘do’, and ke,
which appears to be the same as is used in demonstrative forms. Ake’s verbal base
explains its function as questioning a verb or arguments thereof. Common question
words formed from ake are given in (9) below:
(9) ake
‘how’
akei
‘where’ (how-LOC)

‘what kind’ (how-NN)
‘how’ (intensified)
‘which’ (<ake-geni ‘how-thing’)
‘where’ (which-LOC)Gle means ‘what’ and in general applies to nouns. Its relation to the negating
particle glei is unclear. Pronouns formed from gle appear in (10):
(10) gle

Question words may also be used as indefinite words, though only a few
examples of this occur in the current corpus of data. These examples are ine
‘whoever’, glemegleme ‘whatever place’. All other occurrences of question words are
in questions. The following examples show ine ‘whoever’ and glemegleme ‘whatever
place’ used in their indefinite sense.

The meanings involved here have only been tentatively proposed in this paper
and further clarification is needed. Certainly a difference between the two suffixes -la
‘P.DUR’ and -me ‘D.DUR’ should be obtained.
f. Particle analysis
There is a need to more fully analyse and explain the uses of -me, -i, -ke and some
of the other particles.
g. Polar questions and pe ‘POSB’
Polar questions formed by the possibility particle pe (POSB) are indistinguishable
from statements like “possibly…” It may be that an intonation contour distinguishes
them from statements. Also, the function of pe ‘POSB’ in the following construction is
not clear.
(1) Fori pe

lufwa a-te-ne.

‘It wasn’t pigs that did it – it was men (e.g. messed up the garden).’
h. Morpheme -tie
This morpheme, whose meaning is unknown, has been mentioned in §5.6. It may
have an exclamatory or modal function.
i. Causative impersonal constructions
These should be further examined. They were discussed briefly in §4.1.4.
j. Discourse analysis
Discourse analysis largely remains to be done. Uses of tail-head linkage, other
links, etc. should help in the process of analysing what features each discourse type
manifests. The discourse types are iconically ordered discourses (e.g. narrative,
procedural) and thematically oriented discourses. (e.g. descriptive, explanatory and
hortatory). There is some preliminary marking on some of the texts we have that
gives some clues.","[180, 181]"
"80Kwomtari Grammarthat he shot it. However, if he had gone hunting alone, he could use meneko, but not
menete. Example (7) illustrates this usage of -te with a personal pronoun:
(7) Mene-te metie sabele sabele bule-tu
feti kuta-ie-ke
1NPL-FOC really huge huge basket-COM very tie.up-1S.R-SEQ
teri-ie-o!
MOT.TOWARD-1S.R-VOC
‘I (in contrast to the others) tied up a huge bundle and brought it.’
In (8), there is an implicit contrast between the outside of the tree and its inside.
The contrast is called up by the association between outside and inside and the
contrastive focus on ‘outside’:
falu le-lee-lu-le
feta-la-lu.
(8) Puma-fu-te
outside-ABL-FOC dry do-3S.R-NN-GL see-P.DUR-2S.R
‘You see the outside (bark of tree) that is dry (in contrast to the inside

In example (9), te is used in conjunction with the goal postposition to mark a
noun not in focal position:

geni-te-le
1NPL pig man body-COM do-3S.R-NN thing-FOC-GL
prafe-ie!
shoot.S-1S.R
‘I shot an extraordinary thing – a pig with a man’s body!’3.1.3 Approximation -se
The postposition -se ‘APR’ occurs following the -i postposition, marking a
location fairly close to the speaker. It is most commonly used with deictics, as in (10):
teme-e-la!
(10) Eete-i-se
here-LOC-APR stand.S -2S.IR-EXC
‘Stand here!’
It also occurs in deictic adverbs: se, eese, ese, same (see the discussion in §5.4). It
commonly occurs in the words iteise ‘this approximate location’ and akeise
‘approximately where?’
An unusual use of -se appears in (11), where it is used to form a new noun:Kwomtari Grammar81(11) kuli-se
leg-APR
‘leech’3.1.4 Distributive marker -po
The suffix -po primarily attaches to verbs and indicates distribution over plural
agents or goals (discussed in §4.2.4). A second use of -po is documented in only a
few scattered examples in the present corpus. It functions as a plural marker occurring
before another suffix (e.g. -tu ‘COM’, -mai ‘on top’), to pluralise or indicate
distribution over the marked noun phrase. This is shown in (12), where -po indicates
that the action occurs on top of multiple mats:
(12) Yeboe-po-mai
fati-ne.
mat-DST-on.top put.S-1/3P.R
‘We put it on the mats.’
In example (13), the focus marker te is optional, and po-tu refers back to the
bundles of leaves mentioned in the previous clause.

‘He said to me, “No, let’s track it in the rain!”’3.1.5 Diminutive -keke
The postposition -keke is a diminutive modifying nouns (usually adjectival in
nature) which occur in the predicate of descriptive clauses (see §7.1.3). Although it is
a dimunitive, it actually has the effect of focusing attention on the quality being
expressed.

The postposition pe ‘POSB’ is a discrete word expressing the speaker’s doubt,
along with his belief that the occurrence of the event is within the realm of possibility.
It is very close in meaning to pai ‘PRB’. Both are epistemic judgements (Palmer
2001:7-9). Pe indicates a weak assertion of probability and pai a strong assertion.

people and languageCarol Honsberger

Ian Tupper1. Introduction
1.1 Language setting
Kwomtari is a Papuan (i.e. non-Austronesian) language spoken in Sandaun (West
Sepik) Province of Papua New Guinea. Its approximately 800 speakers are
traditionally hunter-gatherers, who inhabit six villages in the interior of the province.
The language region occupies about 400 square kilometres, and is located between 40
and 60 kilometres east of the Indonesian border (see Map 1).
MAP 1: THE KWOMTARI AREA WITHIN PNG2Introduction3Kwomtari is one of six languages generally grouped together as the ‘Kwomtari
family’. This family is not demonstrably related to any of the larger Papuan families
(e.g. Trans New Guinea, Sepik, Torricelli). To date, virtually no materials have been
published from any of the languages in the family. The only exception is the Fas
language, on which two brief articles have appeared (Baron 1979, 1983a); more
recently, several articles have been posted on the web, also relating to Fas (Baron
2007, n.d.; Blake 2007).
Papua New Guinea is the most linguistically diverse country in the world; in turn,
Sandaun Province is probably linguistically the most diverse region in Papua New
Guinea. Within an area of 36,300 km2 and a population of 185,741 (2000 census),
there are 102 languages – an average of only 1,821 speakers per language – belonging
to eight distinct language families, together with perhaps three isolates (Ross
2005:30). Kwomtari is immediately adjoined by the following languages: Baibai to
the north, Guriaso to the east, Yalë (also known as Nagatman) to the south, Nai (also
known as Biaka) to the south-west, and Amanab to the west. However, the number of
languages within a few days walk is immense (refer Map 2).
MAP 2: KWOMTARI AND NEIGHBOURING LANGUAGES4IntroductionThe area where Kwomtari is spoken is the lowland plain south of the Bewani
Mountains. This mountain range, about 35 kilometres to the north, rises to 1500
metres above sea level, and is the source of rivers which flow southward through the
language area toward the upper reaches of the Sepik River. In contrast, the language
area is largely flat, gradually sloping from 160 metres above sea level in its north to
80 metres elevation in the south. This terrain is covered by dense tropical rainforest
and sago swamp. The language area is bounded in the south by the Yagroner Hills, an
outcropping of about a dozen peaks, the tallest rising to 625 metres; the villages south
of the hills speak Yalë. Yanebi airstrip, in the north of the language area, is located at
a latitude of 3° 31.31’ south and a longitude of 141° 27.69’ east.
The language area has a hot and humid climate. Temperatures vary between an
overnight minimum of about 24 degrees Celsius and a daytime maximum of about 40
degrees. Annual rainfall is between 2000 and 2500 millimetres, with the wet season
roughly between November and March.
Total population was 606 at the time of the 2000 census,1 but is now closer to 800
given the recorded annual births by the SIL team. In total, six villages speak the
language: Kwomtari, Mango, Baifeni, Yanebi, Yaur and Wagreni. (In addition, there
is a settlement known as the Moitari camp, which is not considered a village since it
is occupied only by one clan.) The largest village is Yaur, but Baifeni is considered
the most central village geographically and linguistically.2
The villages are situated on three rivers flowing southward through the language
area. The westernmost of these is the Sukura River (shown on some maps as the
Pukwor). Kwomtari village is currently located on both sides of this river, just below
its confluence with the Yakura River.3 Mango is about two kilometres downstream,
also on both sides of the river. A small hamlet counted as part of Kwomtari village is
adjacent to the Kwomtari airstrip about three kilometres west of the river. East of the
Sukura River is the Senu (North) River, on which Yanebi and Baifeni are located,
with Yanebi furthest upstream. When the Senu River reaches the Yagroner Hills it
1The population figure of 782 given by Loving and Bass (1964) includes villages now considered to
belong to the Guriaso language (including Guriaso, Maragin, Mofor, Wurubai and Ekas).
2
Earlier sources call this village Baiberi. Several village elders have said that the Australian patrols that
came did not pronounce the name correctly, but the people were afraid to correct the white men. In
fact, they themselves began using the white men’s pronunciation of Baiberi. That is the pronunciation
the SIL team heard until 1992, when inhabitants began to revert to the original Baifeni.
3
Laycock (1981) shows a village called ‘New Kwomtari’ on the Bapi River, west of the Sukura. That
village site has been abandoned for several decades, although it is still considered part of the language
area.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

"16911. Residue
Some grammatical features of the languages were not able to be resolved in this
research. Following are some unsolved issues.
a. The suffix -lu
A clear meaning covering all uses of -lu is yet to be found. There are some uses
of -lu which are difficult to account for. Linked with this is the problem of defining
adjectives. It may be possible to form a separate class of adjectives, though I suspect
not. The order within the noun phrase depends on this and is not completely clear.
Use of -lu on clauses needs further investigation. Also, it is not clear why, when the
locative postposition is suffixed to a human entity, -lu must occur between the noun
and the locative postposition.
b. The status of the nominals used in compound verbs
The status of the nominals used in conjunction with the verb le is in question. Are
they actually verbal compounds (incorporations) or are they verb phrases? They
usually are tightly knit together, but other words like feti can sometimes intervene
between the nominal and the derivational verb.
c. Motion suffixes on the verb
It is not clear what functions the te and fe parts of these suffixes play. It is not
clear under what circumstances the suffixes based on te are used in preference to
those based on fe. The distinction may be linked to transitivity. Since one of these
motion suffixes has a second aspectual meaning, others may also display aspectual
meaning.
d. Irrealis status
The uses of irrealis status have not been completely sorted out yet. It is used for
all future events, whatever their certainty. It is also used to mark an ability on the part
of someone to do something. Whether irrealis status can be used for contrafactual
constructions is unknown, because they do not exist in the current data corpus. This
sort of construction will need to be found.","[179, 180]"
"7. Clauses
7.1 Clause structure
7.1.1 Basic clause structure
Every clause must necessarily contain a predicate. Though the vast majority of
predicates involve a verb, there are some that do not. A clause may have an overt
noun phrase subject, which would then precede the verb.
Clause = (Subject) Predicate
Kwomtari has nominative-accusative agreement of both noun phrases and verbal
person markers. The general order in the clause is SOV. Example (1) illustrates this
basic clause order:
(1) Klifu gwaie-le
pie-fo-lee.
dog cassowary-GL bay-3S.O-3S.R
‘The dog bayed at the cassowary.’
However, in all verbal clauses the number and person of the subject, and
generally the goal, if present, are marked on the verb by suffixation. This often leads
to deletion of subject noun phrases (2), goal noun phrases (3), or both (4):
(2) Wokoo-i-le
ri-ie.
village-LOC-GL come-1S.R
‘I came to the village.’
(3) Lufwa fie-fo-ne,
“Marena pe?”
man
ask-3S.O-3P.R true
POSB

Equative predicates are usually non-verbal The verb le ‘do’ can optionally be
used (see §7.1.3 below). Mwa ‘no’ can itself be a predicate.
(5) Nelene wofri feti le-fo-lee,
mene mwa.
Nelen fear very do-3S.O-3S.R, 1NPL no
‘Nelen’s really afraid of him, I’m not.’
(6) Mene klifu wolu.
1NPL dog already
‘I have a dog.’
(7) Mene klifu mwa.
1NPL dog no
‘I don’t have a dog.’7.1.3 Descriptive clauses
Descriptive clauses have two primary components: an optional subject and an
obligatory predicate. The predicate contains a complement conveying a noun
characteristic and, usually optionally, the verb le ‘do’. If le is present it rarely has
more than subject/status marking.
(8) Eete-geni ite
selilu mena-nu (le-lee).

‘This big house is mine.’

sometimes marked with durative aspect to specify the time period during which the
entity demonstrated the characteristic. This is illustrated in (13):
(13) Sospan
nigi le-la-lee.
saucepan hot do-P.DUR-3S.R
‘The saucepan is hot.’
When adjectives occur in the predicate, they can optionally be stripped of their
-lu ending:
(14) Ka ri-lu
wi le-lee.
tree body-NN red do-3S.R
‘The tree’s body is red.’
(15) Mene tukilu le-ie.
1NPL small do-1S.R
‘I am small.’7.1.4 Comparisons
There are no comparative or superlative adjectival forms. Comparisons are made
with the verb le ‘do’, preceded by an adjective giving the quality in question. The
entity being compared is the subject of the verb, while the standard of comparison is
positioned and marked as the goal. Examples (16) and (17) show the comparative
construction:
mena-nu klifu-le.
(16) Una-nu klifu seli-me feti le-fo-lee
2.PN-NN dog big-CER very do-3S.O-3S.R 1.PN-NN dog-GL
‘Your dog is bigger than mine.’ (Lit. ‘Your dog does very big to my

1.PN-NN skin 2.PN-NN skin-GL black do-1/2S.O-3S.R
‘My skin is blacker than yours.’ (Lit. ‘My skin does black to your skin.’)
The particle keme ‘resemblance’ is used to state resemblance. Here, the item
compared is the subject of the predicate, which contains the standard of comparison,
followed by keme and the verb le ‘do’ (see §6.1.5).

2NPL 2.PN-NN father.1/2 resemblance do-2S.R
‘You’re like your father.’
The word keme does not specify the particulars of the resemblance. These must
be gained from context. In example (19), the speaker could be referring to physical
appearance or to character.
It is possible to be more specific, for example:
(20) Klifu are mwamole ri-lu-me
le-ne.

body-NN-CER do-1/3P.R
‘The two dogs are the same (size, colour).’ (Lit. ‘have one body’)
Another word, atuke, has similar usage to keme. My hypothesis is that atuke
implies exact similarity (identicality), and keme merely resemblance. Atuke occurs
only in these descriptive clauses.

predicate:1

"Kwomtari Grammar853.2 Set 2 – Postpositions relating one noun to another
3.2.1 Noun phrase marker/nominaliser -lu
This postposition is used in many environments and I am unsure of its central
underlying meaning. I have glossed it NN, a noun phrase marker or nominaliser. NN
reflects its primary function, which is to relate nouns to nouns.
The postposition -lu marks animate possessors, as examples (36) and (37) show.
(36) Samuele-lu ite
Samuel-NN house
‘Samuel’s house’
(37) Gote-lu kaisekli
God-NN strength
‘God’s strength’
In modifier-modified compound nouns, where the first noun serves as a specifier
for the second noun, -lu is suffixed to the second noun, as in examples (38) and (39).
Adjectives (§2.1.3) tend to be the last item in a noun phrase, and in this position
always end in -lu (40). In each of these cases, -lu appears to indicate the terminal
member of a noun phrase.
(38) fwi
nagli-lu
coconut base-NN
‘base of the coconut (tree)’
(39) maie ai-lu
egg house-NN
‘bird’s nest’
(40) beni
wi-lu
banana ripe-NN
‘ripe banana’
When a noun phrase involves an animate being, a way (ami), or a story (na), the
behaviour seems to be different, with the adjective more often coming before the
noun:
(41) rame-lu
lufwa
knowledge-NN man
‘knowledgeable man’86Kwomtari GrammarThe suffix -lu acts to nominalise clauses. In this role it marks relative clauses,
normally preceding the noun that it modifies, due to its weight (see examples (42) and
(43)).
(42) afoo yefu
kuka-la-lee-lu
sineku

cassowary-COM dog-COM fall.P-1/3P.R-NN account
‘Account of a cassowary and a dog falling.’
Examples (44) and (45) show clauses functioning as complete noun phrases, with
suffixation. In these cases -lu precedes other suffixes that relate the nominalised
expression to the predicate:
(44) Lie gaga ne-la-lee-lu-fi
sina-te-le.

FOC-COM pull-DST-2S.IR
‘The ones (grubs) that are right inside, after you have cut thorns, then
you’ll (use them to) pull them (grubs) out.’3.2.2 Comitative -tu
The postposition -tu is used in a comitative sense to conjoin two noun phrases
acting as subject. (See §3.3.4 for the related use of this postposition on nouns in the
predicate.) The suffix -tu only expresses dual accompaniment. It occurs sometimes
with the dual pronoun weife. Sometimes both nouns are marked (46), and sometimes
only the second (47). The resulting conjoined noun phrase causes the subject marker
on the verb to be plural. Where both noun phrases are marked, they are considered of
equal importance. Where only the second is marked, it is of secondary importance –
an accompanier to the first.
klifu-tu
yekrune-ne-lu

(48) Wofri-wofri-tu wa-lee.
RED-fear-COM go-3S.R
‘He went in (lit. with) great fear.’3.3 Set 3 – Postpositions relating a noun to the clausal
predicate
3.3.1 Locative -i, -fi
The postpositions -i, -fi both indicate the location of the marked noun phrase in
space or time. They are both allomorphs of one morpheme, -i occurring more
frequently. Words borrowed from Tok Pisin can host either allomorph; any of the
forms in (49) or (50) is acceptable:
(49) a. hefene-fi
heaven-LOC
‘in heaven’ (TP long heven)
b. hefene-i
heaven-LOC
‘in heaven’ (TP long heven)
(50) a. stua-fi
store-LOC
‘at/in the store’ (TP long stua)
b. stua-i
store-LOC
‘at/in the store’ (TP long stua)
Some vernacular nouns ending in u or i obligatorily occur with -i, but other nouns
ending in -u or -i may occur with -fi. The dialect of Kwomtari and Mango villages
always uses the -fi allomorph. It appears that the Baifeni dialect is also shifting to -fi88Kwomtari Grammarfor nouns ending in -u or -i to avoid the morphophonemic shifts that they require
when -i is suffixed4.
The morpheme -i seems to have a general meaning of anchoring an entity to a
location in space and time. This is evident in its use as a locative postposition, and as
a clause-final marker of simultaneous action -i ‘SIM’ (see §4.2.9).
Examples (51) - (54) show that the locative marker can be used with different
kinds of locations:
(51) Bule-i
purele-lu-ke…
basket-LOC put.in-2S.R-SEQ
‘You put them in the basket, and...’
la-la-ne.

a-la-ne.
(54) Fori si-silu
afwi-i
pig RED-baby trail-LOC do-P.DUR-1/3P.R
‘Baby pigs were on the trail.’
Example (55) shows that the locative can also be used to describe location in
time:
(55) Lufwa mwamole kotukrie-i klifu noune-lee-ke…
Man one
dawn-LOC dog take-3S.R-SEQ
‘One man at dawn took his dog and…’
When the location in question is a person, the suffix -lu is attached, followed by
locative -fi.
(56) Lufwa glei wa-be,
eete-geni inali-lu-fi-le.
man
NEG go-3S.IR, this-thing woman-NN-LOC-GL
‘A man mustn’t go – to this woman.’
Other locative postpositions may be used to mark a more specific location. All
are formed from a noun + -i. They include:

vowel phonemes, but can be demonstrated through the phonotactic constraints of
the language. One reason for this difficulty is that the vowel /ɛ/ is often
pronounced [ə], apparently in any environment. An example is given in (7):
(7)[ɛkɛni] ~ [əkəni]/ɛkɛni/‘that’Schwa never receives stress when other vowels are present in a word. The
sole instance of a stressed schwa is the word /mənə/ [mənə], in which the initial
schwa is stressed. Additionally, Kwomtari language advisors who have been
educated in the five-vowel system of Tok Pisin have a tendency to omit a symbol
for this sound when they are writing certain words. The following words are
written without schwa quite frequently (angle brackets enclose common
spellings):
(8)/məɭi/[məɭi]<mli>‘water, river’/mənə/[mənə]<mne, mune>‘I’/ɸəta/[ɸətɐ]<fta>‘see’It is sometimes difficult to hear the schwa between the consonants, but I am
convinced it is present. When these words are spoken slowly and deliberately, the
vowel is evident. This cannot be said concerning other consonant clusters in the
language, which are only permitted when the second is a liquid (see §3.3). As
further support of this analysis, note that these three words are the only ones30Kwomtari Phonologyexhibiting these ‘consonant clusters’ (other than <afteli>, discussed below). More
examples of /mɭ/, /mn/ and /ɸt/ would be expected if they were true clusters.
Further evidence is the word <afteli> ‘quickly’. This word is probably
underlyingly /a.ɸə.tɛ.ɭi/ [ɐ.βə.tɛ.ɭi], with a syllable divison following /a/, and
schwa between /ɸ/ and /t/. The alternative would require an initial VC syllable
/aɸ/, which is a syllable type not found elsewhere in the language (see §3.1).
However, there are a few contrastive pairs for schwa:
(9) /ə/ vs/ɛ//a//məɭi/[məɭi]‘water, river’/mɛɭi/[mɛɭi]‘aunt’/məkəiɭə/[məkəiɭə]‘arrow shaft’/uɛiau/[uwɛijɐu]‘black cockatoo’/iɛtuə/[jɛtuwə]‘sago leaf thatch’/abuɛ/[ɐᵐbuwɛ]‘grandkin’/iɛtuə/[jɛtuwə]‘sago leaf thatch’/bubua/[bubuwɐ]‘beat’/mənə/[mənə]‘I’/məna/[mənɐ]‘we’3. Phonotactics
3.1 Syllable structure
The most common pattern for Kwomtari syllables is CV. Only syllables
consisting of onset + peak (e.g. CV) may occur in non-initial position. Closed
syllables, which are very rare, may not end with a plosive; generally the final
segment is a nasal. There are no unambiguous examples of VC syllables.
Examples of acceptable syllable patterns follow:

"6.1 Morphophonemic variations affecting nouns
6.1.1 Locative suffix
The locative suffix -i, affects the final vowel of the stem in some instances.
There are no changes for nouns ending in /ɛ/, /a/, or /ɔ/; the locative marker is
simply attached to the stem. Examples (1) - (3) illustrate this:
(1)/kriɛ + -i//kriɛi/‘in the night’(2)/ku̞na + -i//ku̞nai/‘in the back’(3)/ambɔ + -i//ambɔi/‘in the jungle’For nouns ending with lowered high vowels, the final vowel of the stem is
lowered to the low-mid front vowel. Examples are given in (4) and (5):
(4)/kɭi̞ + -i//kɭɛi/‘in the swamp’(5)/uɔku̞ + -i//uɔkɛi/‘in the village’In words ending in diphthongs, the first vowel within the final vowel sequence
is affected, rather than the vowel directly preceding the locative marker.
The locative suffix /-ɸi/ is an allomorph of /-i/. This allomorph can be suffixed
to any noun, without difference in meaning from /-i/ and without changing the
final vowel. Nouns ending in /i/ and /u/ obligatorily take /-ɸi/ as a suffix rather
than -i; for other nouns it is an optional alternative. Examples are given in (6) and
(7):44Kwomtari Phonology45(6)/riɭu + -ɸi//riɭuɸi/‘in the liver’(7)/ɭutuɸi + -ɸi//ɭutuɸiɸi/‘in the hair’There seems to be no reason for preferring one allomorph over another, except
in the following instance:
(8)a. /buɭu̞ + -ɸi//buɭu̞ɸi/b.*/buɭu̞ + -i//buɭɛi/‘in the large intestine’Example (8b) is unacceptable, since it is identical in form with (9) below:
(9)/buɭɛ + -i//buɭɛi/‘in the basket’The morphophonemic changes resulting from suffixing -fi can be summarised
as follows:

Two suffixes occurring on nominals are -lu ‘noun-noun relator’, which in this
case references a possessor, and -le ‘goal’, which references an undergoer or
beneficiary. In both these suffixes l becomes n when affixed to first person (mna,
mne, nia) or second person pronouns (une), but does not change when affixed to
nouns or third person pronouns (nanu, nali). The examples in (10) show -lu in its
unconditioned state; the examples in (11) show the application of the
morphophonemic rule:46Kwomtari Phonology
(10)(11)a. /paɭiakɔ + -ɭu//paɭiakɔɭu/‘Paliako’s’b. /nanu + -ɭu//nanuɭu/‘his / her / hers / their(s)’c. /naɭi + -ɭu//naɭiɭu/‘his / her / their own’a. /məna + -nu//mənanu/‘my / mine’b. /una + -nu//unanu/‘your / yours’Similarly, (12) and (13) show respectively the unconditioned and conditioned
forms of -le:
(12)(13)a. /paɭiakɔ + -ɭɛ//paɭiakɔɭɛ/‘to Paliako’b. /nanu + -ɭɛ//nanuɭɛ/‘to him/her’c. /naɭi + -ɭɛ//naɭiɭɛ/‘to him / her / them’a. /məna + -nɛ//mənanɛ/‘to me’b. /una + -nɛ//unanɛ/‘to you’1Three nasals are not permitted in succession, so for the third person pronoun
nanu, the suffixes must revert to -lu and -le. The third person pronoun nali does
not fulfil the condition of the rule so the suffixes remain as -lu and -le.","[54, 55, 56]"

specific. Clauses are simply juxtaposed, then a form of the verb ‘do’ (-le or -a) is used
with the adverb eese, which generically recapitulates the events of the previous
clauses.

Kwomtari has two verbs which can introduce a quotation. The most common is
ne ‘say’, which is used for both direct and indirect quotations. In all cases where ne isKwomtari Grammar157used, it is given appropriate subject/status and object suffixes, which indicates the
independent nature of the clause and the coordinate nature of the sentence. This verb
has the form ne when occurring without an addressee, and na when an addressee is
stated: in this case the addressee is always referenced with object marking on the
verb. Examples (19) - (21) below illustrate this point; in (19) and (20) no addressee is
specified, but there is an explicit addressee in (21).

‘He said to brother Agai, “OK, give it to me, first I want to see.”’
Direct quotations are almost always preceded by ne, as in (21) above; sometimes
the object noun phrase occurs between the verb and the quote. Some quotations have
ne both preceding and following, as in example (22) below. The second instance of ne
can be interpreted as tail-head linkage, i.e. the beginning of the following clause
recapitulating the substance of the preceding clause. The adverb eese ‘thus’ may
occur with ne either preceding or following the quotation:158Kwomtari Grammar(22) Na-te-ie,

‘I said to them, “Libu, he told us to hurry, then we tracked it.” I was

Only short quotations may occur with ne following rather than preceding. One

‘… I gave (some) to a clan and they asked me, “Who shot the pig?”’
The other quotative verb is fie ‘ask’. Fie always precedes the quotation, as in (24)
and (25) below. The verb ne ‘say’ can also be used when a question is asked, rather
than fie.
“Fori akei-e?”

‘And Casper asked them, “Why did you (pl) flee?”’
In continuous speech, quotations may not be separately marked; the hearer is
expected to keep track of the participants. Indirect quotations of speech or thought are
formed with ne ‘say’; ne follows the indirect quotation. These are formed like direct
quotes, but 1st person irrealis markers are used on quoted verbs. This use of the
morpheme -fe displays a link between its two meanings of reason and 1st singular
irrealis. Here, as well as encoding an indirect quote, it also displays the semantic
notion of purpose. In fact, -fe in both of its semantic senses is regularly used to
encode purpose (see §3.3.5).

Complex sentences contain one or more dependent clauses, together with an
independent clause. They are conjoined by the suffixes -ke ‘SEQ’, -i ‘SIM’ or a
conjunction. The final, independent clause is the only one which may be marked
either for realis or irrealis status. Preceding clauses are marked with default realis
status, but in fact take their status from the final clause.","[165, 166, 167, 168, 169]"
"1.2.5 Wealth and income
There are very limited number of sources of income within the Kwomtari
language area. Market produce is a possibility; however the nearest market, Amanab,
is a full day’s walk away through sago swamp. Smoked meat brings a fair market
price but takes away protein from people who already have a protein-deficient diet.
Some families grow tobacco near their houses and will sell the tobacco braids to
neighbouring language groups. During the drought of 1996, several men were able to
sell crocodile skins, but this is not a regular source of income. It was difficult to get
the skin to market in prime condition, as it was a five day walk to Vanimo, the
provincial capital. As of April 2008, men can reach Vanimo in two days, getting a
ride on the timber company vehicles. Clothes, salt, pots, and garden tools are the
things they would buy with cash. They are willing to spend money on school fees, but
these are very high relative to their income.
Until recently there were no cash crops, aside from tobacco. A few men took a
course on growing vanilla, and several villages now have vanilla gardens. However,
the price of vanilla had dropped before they were able to reap the benefits. One man
harvested a crop of soybeans but then found it difficult to get them to Vanimo to sell.
There are a few trade stores within the language group but they have very limited
supplies. Two men in Baifeni village run a ‘literacy’ trade store whose profits help
pay for workshops and literacy materials.
The people see a large influx of money, i.e. from the timber company, as the
answer to many of their problems (lack of health care, inadequate schools, lack of
basics such as clothing, kerosene, clean water supply, etc.). Unfortunately, most
spend money as quickly as they receive it. Money is shared within the clan the same
as any other commodity.",[20]
"1.2.6 Linguistic vitality and education
The people think highly of their language. Most women marrying into the
language group learn to speak Kwomtari. Although Tok Pisin is becoming stronger in
the area, Kwomtari is still the predominant language in almost every social situation,
except when speaking to outsiders. Many Tok Pisin terms and phrases tend to get
mixed into their speech. In church services, once the scripture has been read from the
Tok Pisin Bible, the preaching is either done in Tok Pisin then in vernacular, or in the
vernacular only. They have begun to use those portions of scripture already translatedIntroduction11in their services with much affirmation from the people – most of these being women.
The community schoolteacher is an outsider and uses Tok Pisin. Although English is
used at school, the children are never heard conversing in English.
Tok Pisin is seen as a means of better opportunities outside the language area. It
will be needed to get work with the timber company when it comes. A definite
majority of men know Tok Pisin, and now many of the women as well are learning it.
Educational levels among the Kwomtari are low, and consequently so is literacy.
Currently there are about fifteen grade 10 leavers, only one of whom has completed
grade 10 since the 1990s. Tok Pisin schools were established by the CMML mission
at various times; one was operating for women in Yaur but the teacher died in 2007.
Community schools have also operated at various times in the area, but have had
difficulties retaining teachers; they are currently operating in Mango and Guriaso.
There is a proposal to move the community school to Yanebi, but unless the people
come up with a plan to maintain the airstrip there this will not happen. Many people
view education as a positive thing and see it as a means to getting development,
perhaps more so now that the timber company operation is so near to beginning in
this area.","[20, 21]"
"2[Editors’ note] An alternative analysis would be that the semi-vowels are phonemic /j/ and /w/
wherever their occurrence cannot be accounted for under the semi-vowel insertion processes

There are four suffixes which occur verb-finally on dependent verbs (see §8.4 for
discussion of the relationship between dependent and independent clauses). Two of
these are medial clause markers; one suffix is subordinating; and one suffix marks the
end of a negated clause.
a. Coordinating Medial Verb Suffixes
The following verb suffixes occur on medial verbs only:122Kwomtari Grammar-ke
-i‘sequential’
‘simultaneous’11Unlike many other Papuan languages with medial verbs, Kwomtari has no
switch-reference system. Both -ke and -i may express relationships between verbs that
have the same subject (example (98)) or verbs that have different subjects (example
(99)). Note that -ke occurs in all types of discourse, not just narrative texts.
feta-ne-ke
asine-ne-ke
(98) Mare-me wa-ne-ke
all-CER
go-1/3P.R-SEQ see-1/3P.R-SEQ butcher-1/3P.R-SEQ
teri-po-ne
wokoo-i-le.
carry-DISTR-1/3P.R village-LOC-GL
‘They all went, saw it (the pig), butchered it, and carried it to the village.’
(99) Seise kakali yesou
tine-po-lee-ke
fo-po-ne-ke
Seise food something give-DISTR-3S.R-SEQ eat-DSR-1/3P.R-SEQ
wa-ne.
te
aue kri-po-ne-ke
FOC bag carry-DISTR-1/3P.R-SEQ go-1/3P.R
‘Seise gave us food, we ate it, we carried our bags and went.’
The gloss ‘simultaneous’ does not cover the entire semantic range encoded by the
suffix -i. When the verb it occurs with is also marked with durative aspect (-la or
-me), it does mean simultaneous, in that the following verb occurs at the same time as
the marked verb (see example (100)). The verbal suffix -i can be considered similar to
the postposition -i, which binds a noun phrase to a particular location in space or
time. When no durative aspect is present, it marks a temporal contingency/condition,
similar to the English ‘when’. Used in sentences with realis status, its meaning is
similar to that of -ke, in that the marked verb is completed before the next verb
begins. But unlike -ke, which can be thought of as encoding the semantic notion of
English ‘after’, -i signals that the marked verb is an obligatory precondition for the
following verb to occur. Example (101) illustrates this. When a sentence has irrealis
status or is in the imperative mood, -i is used to express ‘when’ or ‘if’ that event
happens. This contrasts with -ke which marks a succession of events, the future
occurrence of the event being presumed. (See examples (102) and (103) below).
Efesise sekale-lee.
(100) I
fufa-la-ie-i
fire prepare-P.DUR-1S.R-SIM Ephesus arrive.S-3S.R
‘While I was making a fire, Ephesus arrived.’
11Note that -i is not apparent when it immediately follows u (as with the 2nd singular realis suffix -lu);
when -i follows the 3rd singular realis suffix -lee, -ee drops out and only -i is evident.","[130, 131, 132]"

some explanation. They are very close in tongue height to /i/ and /u/; they are also
higher than IPA cardinal vowels [e] and [o]. These vowels are not centralised as in
English /I/, /ʊ/. It is often very difficult to hear the difference between these
vowels and the higher counterparts. Villagers who have been taught reading and
writing in the five-vowel Tok Pisin system will sometimes write /i̞/ as <i> and
sometimes as <e>; they will also sometimes write /u̞/ as <u> and sometimes as28Kwomtari Phonology<o>. This orthographic inconsistency strengthens the analysis that the five-vowel
system of Tok Pisin does not match the Kwomtari vowel system.2
Minimal pairs showing the contrasts between the lowered high vowels and
similar vowels are shown in (6). Since these vowels are relatively unusual, several
pairs of contrasts are given where possible:

1.PN-NN sago NEG eat-P.DUR-1/3P.R-NEG
‘They (pigs) aren’t eating my sago.’4.3 Verb phrase
The verb phrase has the following constituents: (a) pre-verbal negator; (b) noun
modifiers to the verb, i.e. noun phrases that are intrinsically part of the verb, forming
nominal + verb compounds or tightly knit units; (c) core arguments of the verb (actor,
goals); and (d) oblique arguments of the verb (e.g. reason, location, instrument). The
verb phrase may constitute the entire clause (even sentential utterance).
Order within the verb phrase is relatively free, with the exception that the verb
occurs last. Some orders are slightly more common and suggest the following as the
default ordering:
(NEG) (GL PP) (RSN PP) (LOC PP) (COM PP) (Manner Adv) (Deictic Adv) V
When the pre-verbal negator glei is present, it obligatorily intervenes between the
subject and the verb. This provides evidence for the existence of a verb phrase at a
separate level from the clause. Example (106) illustrates the obligatory ordering of
glei within the verb phrase:
(106) Eete-geni lufwa glei Aie
Gote-le arie
nuboue
here-thing man NEG father.1/2 God-GL stomach good
le-fo-lee.
do-3S.O-3S.R

comitative PPs in the verb phrase:

Kwomtari has adverbs encoding the manner in which an event is performed,
general and specific temporal adverbs, negating adverbs, deictic adverbs, locational
adverbs and modal adverbs. This chapter describes first adverbs of manner (§5.1),
then temporal adverbs (§5.2), negators (§5.3), deictic adverbs (§5.4), locative adverbs
(§5.5) and finally modal adverbs (§5.6).","[132, 133, 134, 135, 136]"
"6.2 Morphophonemic variations affecting verbs
6.2.1 First person singular subject marker
Verbs ending in /ɛ/ delete /ɛ/ when suffixed with the first person singular
subject marker (-ie /iɛ/). This process is illustrated in examples (14) - (17):1(14)/kiɸɛ + -iɛ//kiɸiɛ/‘I cut’(15)/niɸɛ + -iɛ//niɸiɛ/‘I follow’(16)/uririnɛ + -iɛ//uririniɛ/‘I choose’(17)/i̞nɛ + -iɛ//i̞niɛ/‘I cry’[Editors’ Note] The underlying form of mene is /'mənə/. Since /mə'nɐnu/ ‘my/mine’ is permitted,
the analysis should perhaps read ‘Three identical nasals are not permitted in a single word.’Kwomtari Phonology476.2.2 Vowel harmony
Stem-final /ɛ/ on verbs is frequently rounded and backed when a syllable
ending in /u/ is suffixed. This rule is optional; my language advisors inform me
that the vowel may remain unchanged and still be well-formed. However, my
impression is that this rule is usually applied. The rule is illustrated in (18) - (20)
below; all the examples are well-formed:
(18)/puɛɭu/ ~ /puɔɭu/‘you dug’(19)/jəunɛtɛɭu/ ~ /jəunɛtɔɭu/ ‘you laughed at them’(20)/tuɛɭu/ ~ /tuɔɭu/‘you cooked’Example (21) demonstrates that the alternate forms in (20) are the result of
vowel harmony:
(21)/tuɛɭi̞ / ~ */tuɔɭi̞ /‘he/she cooked’Vowel harmony is a morphophonemic rule occurring with verb suffixes, not a
phonological rule throughout the language. The following words, all found in the
language, do not show vowel harmony:2
(22)a./aiɛbu/‘crayfish’b./bɛsuka/‘rafter’c./iɭɛkuɭi/‘fire pit’d./kaɭiɛɸu/‘bird’e./ɛsuɭu/‘immediately’f./prijɛmu/‘string’6.2.3 Vowel raising
When the low-mid back vowel /-ɔ/ is the final vowel in a verbal suffix, it is
raised to the lowered high vowel /-u̞/ if it immediately precedes any of a specific
set of verbal suffixes. At first, it seemed as though these changes were based
2[Editors’ note] it appears that the morphophonemic rule is in the process of generalising, becoming
a phonological rule. Some speakers have been heard to say [bɔsukɐ] for besuka, [iɭɔkuɭi] for
ilekuli, and [prijɔmu] for priemu. However, this tendency is less marked than the morphophonemic
rule noted above.","[56, 57]"

knowledge at the time of writing. They normally do not provide a comprehensive
treatment of the topic and may contain analyses which will be modified at a later stage.
However, given the large number of undescribed languages in Papua New Guinea, SILPNG feels that it is appropriate to make these research results available at this time.

sequence of two vowels, the vowels constitute a diphthong if the second vowel is
higher than the first one. Only if this condition is met are the vowels treated by
Kwomtari speakers as belonging to the same syllable. If the second vowel is lower
than the first vowel or the same height, the vowels belong to adjoining syllables. A
maximum of two vowels can occur in the same syllable; triphthongs do not occur
in Kwomtari. Since only syllables of the type ‘onset + peak’ occur in non-initial
position, the end of every non-initial syllable is marked by a permitted diphthong
or single vowel.","[43, 44]"

The particle mani ‘PHB’ is unique in always occurring after the final verb in the
clause or sentence being prohibited. It possibly comes from mwa nie < mwa ne-ie ‘I
said “no” (lit. no say-1S.R). It is no longer used as a verb since it does not change with
a change in subject. Negative imperatives are discussed in §9.3. Two examples are
given here:
(36) Wofoli
na-fo-lu

lest thought do-3P.O-2S.R PHB
‘Don’t think of them.’6.2 Conjunctions
The focus marker te (see §6.1.1) is the most frequently used conjunction and the
basis for all others, except for the adversative conjunction o ‘or’ which is taken
directly from Tok Pisin. In a text, sentences other than the initial one often start with
te. Te marks what has gone before; it is perhaps best translated ‘given that’. The other
conjunctions are given below. They all express logical clausal relationships, whereas
the clausal suffixes -ke ‘SEQ’ and -i ‘SIM’ express temporal relationships between
clauses.
FOC-COM ‘then’ – chronologically next.
tetu
The first proposition is immediately accompanied by the
second.
tete
FOC-FOC
‘therefore’ – imminent consequence.
The first proposition is a strong cause, forcing the
second.
FOC-RSN
‘so’ – result.
tefe
The first proposition is an enabling clause for the second.
o
(from TP) ‘or’
Examples of conjunctions as they occur in conjoined sentences are given in §8.2
and §8.4.2. For ease of comprehension, I will use the glosses ‘then’, ‘therefore’ and
‘so’ rather than their literal morpheme by morpheme glosses.","[153, 154, 155]"

Kwomtari has a marker of focus, te, which most often functions as a conjunction
(see §6.2 for further discussion). This focus marker is the basis for the two most
frequently used demonstratives, which are formed by prefixing ee- or u-. Te marks an
established deictic centre in discourse. With the prefixes ee- and u-, the deictic centre
is the speaker, and the demonstratives formed mark close proximity and distance
respectively.14
Kwomtari has a three-term demonstrative system:
a. eete
‘here: close by’
b. eke
‘there: a bit further away, e.g. out of reach but still in sight’
c. ute
‘over there: further away (yonder)’13
14Free translation in Tok Pisin: Yu yet bai givim long ol susa.
[Editors’ note] These forms provide further evidence for the hypothesis (Dixon 2003: 88-89) that
‘near’ demonstratives are more likely cross-linguistically to involve front high vowels.","[79, 80]"
"1.3.5 The papers
The following papers on the phonology and grammar of Kwomtari are revised
versions of papers (Drew 1998; Spencer 1998) written by two English women, Julia
Drew and Katharine Spencer, who were recent university graduates. They were
assigned in 1998 to assist an SIL language programme under SIL’s Graduate
International Programme (GRIP). The authors conducted fieldwork while living with
Murray and Carol Honsberger in Baifeni village for 9 weeks, and subsequently wrote
up their findings at the SIL centre at Ukarumpa in the Eastern Highlands. While the
papers are still preliminary work in many ways, their conclusions have been validated
by application in the field, and SIL considers they should be made available to the
wider linguistic world as analysis of a previously undescribed language.
The papers have been edited by permission of the authors, who are no longer
active in Papua New Guinea. In editing the papers, we have attempted to keep a
balance between preserving the integrity of the original documents, and updatingIntroduction15them in the light of ten years’ additional experience of work in the language. Further
examples have been inserted to illustrate points made by the authors, and the text has
been reworded to improve the presentation. In addition, references in the text to other
sources have been updated to the latest edition known, and further cross-references
have been added where it has seemed appropriate. However, no changes have been
made in the analysis unless a major point relevant to the discussion was not covered
in the original paper or where subsequent evidence showed the original analysis
needed to be refined. Where a change in the analysis has been made, it has been
footnoted.","[24, 25]"
"66Kwomtari Grammar
TABLE 5: SET 1 PRONOUNS8Non-plural subjectPlural subject1menemenamenanumenane2uneunaunanuunane9nanulunanule3nanu ~ nalu ~ nanePossessiveObjectNumber distinctions for first and second person subjects are apparently made on
the basis of non-plural (singular or dual) versus plural (more than two). This number
marking does not match plural marking everywhere else in the language, in which
‘plural’ signifies ‘two or more’. A similar category of ‘non-plural’ number marking
occurs with some nouns in the nearby language Imonda (Seiler 1985:38).
The free personal pronouns are most commonly found as the subjects of clauses,
although they are not obligatory in this position. For example, (42) would be equally
grammatical if the pronoun were deleted:
tu-lee.
(42) Nanu ite

/nanə/. Schwa /ə/ is a marginal phoneme in Kwomtari, and is underrepresented in the orthography.
Refer to discussion at §2.2 of paper by Drew (this volume).

[Editors’ note] Nanu is the form used in Baifeni village, nalu in Yaur and Yanebi, and nane in
Kwomtari, Mango and Wagreni.","[75, 76]"
"4.1.5 Existential verbs
Kwomtari has no copular verb but it does have ways of saying that things exist,
using various verbs. The most commonly used existential verb is la ‘remain’. This is
closest to the copula in meaning; it indicates that something is really present, rather
than abstractly existing; and in a specific location (though this may not be explicitly
expressed). La is also unusual in having slightly different forms for plural animates
and inanimates; animates use la (example (24)), but inanimates use lai (25):
la-la-ne.

immovable (e.g. houses, trees, standing plants) are said to ‘stand’ rather than simply
‘remain’. But note that the verb teme ‘stand’ can be used with any noun under
appropriate conditions.

‘Near Peter’s house there’s a ficus (rubber) tree.’
It is also possible to use the verb a ‘do’ in similar ways to la for animates,
indicating more motion on the part of the subject. So example (27) would be more
natural than the equivalent sentence using la, as cassowaries do not remain still.

Subject suffixes are the only obligatory markers on the verb. Subject marking has
a nominative-accusative orientation; the subjects of intransitive verbs (28) and (30)
receive the same suffixes as the corresponding actors of transitive verbs (29) and
(31):
(28) Fori te, tafi-la-lee.

‘The pig died.’

TABLE 2: VOWEL PHONEMESfrontcentralbackhighiulowered highi̞u̞
əmid
lower-midɛlowɔ
aKwomtari has eight vowel phonemes. The discussion of the vowels and
contrasts will proceed progressively, moving from the more usual to the less usual
contrasts. Five of the Kwomtari vowels correspond to the five basic vowels of
Papuan languages (Foley 1986:52). These five vowels are:
/i/ occurs as a high front unrounded vowel;
/ɛ/ occurs as a lower-mid front unrounded vowel;
/u/ occurs as a high back rounded vowel;
/ɔ/ occurs as a lower-mid back rounded vowel;
The low central vowel /a/ occurs as two allophones, which are in free variation
in all environments. These allophones are [a], a fully open central unrounded
vowel, and [ɐ], a not quite fully open, central unrounded vowel (Pullum and
Ladasaw 1986:6). Both occur, but [ɐ] is more common. However, the phoneme is
spelled /a/ for ease of reading. Examples are given in (4):26Kwomtari Phonology(4)/akanɛ/[ɐkɐnɛ] ~ [akanɛ]‘garamut1 tree seed’/aɸui/[ɐβʷi] ~ [aβʷi]‘path’/ɸatiɛ/[ɸɐtijɛ] ~ [ɸatijɛ]‘put’/rari/[rɐri] ~ [rari]‘yell’/na/[nɐ] ~ [na]‘talk’/ɸuna/[ɸunɐ] ~ [ɸuna]‘hit’Minimal or near-minimal pairs for these five vowels are given in (5):

gongs (Mihalic 1971).","[34, 35, 36]"
"4.2 Prenasalisation
When a voiced plosive occurs in a syllable preceded by a syllable beginning
with a nasal, the voiced plosive becomes prenasalised with a homorganic nasal.
Examples appear in (7) below:
(7)/kuɔnɛbɭu/[kʷɔ.nɛ. ͫbɭu]‘white’/muaɡiɸɛ/[mʷɐ. ɡi.βɛ]‘three’/naɡɭi/[nɐ. ɡɭi]‘vein’/nəbɔə/[nə. ͫbɔ.wə]‘good’ŋŋThe velar nasal is only found in Kwomtari as a result of the prenasalisation
process. The only apparent exception, shown in (8), is the word for ‘try’: /aɡɛ/
[ɐŋɡɛ].
(8)/aɡɛ/[ɐ.ŋɡɛ]‘try’In (8) there is no apparent nasal to cause prenasalisation, but a single example
of [ŋ] is not sufficient to justify treating it as a phoneme in its own right. Rather, it
seems to fit into a pattern of other words beginning with /a/ showing
prenasalisation of their voiced plosives without a preceding nasal:Kwomtari Phonology(9)39/abɔ/[ɐ. ͫbɔ]‘jungle’/abɔu/[ɐ. ͫbɔu]‘turtle’/abu̞/[ɐ. ͫbu̞]‘penis’/abuɛ/[ɐ. ͫbu.wɛ]‘grandkin’/abɛi/[ɐ. ͫbɛi]‘below’/aɡɛ/[ɐ.ŋɡɛ]‘try’It is difficult to prove whether the first five examples are examples of
prenasalisation or just words where the first syllable ends in a nasal and the second
syllable begins with a homorganic voiced plosive, but it seems significant that all
these words begin with the same phoneme. The initial /a/, like all Kwomtari
vowels, shows no sign of nasalisation, so if these words do show prenasalisation,
as the last example would suggest, the most likely explanation would be that there
is a diachronic reason to account for this phenomenon. The word for ‘grandkin’ is
entered twice in our lexicon – once as ambue (1st and 2nd person reference) and
once as nambue (3rd person reference).
The prenasalisation rule also affects speakers’ pronunciation of the allophones
[ɭ] and [ɖ], which are in free variation with each other. One of the verbs for ‘to do’
is ne. When the proximal durative aspect suffix -la is added, if the first sound of
this suffix is [ɭ], there is no change. However, if the first sound of this suffix is
pronounced [ɖ], a homorganic nasal is inserted before the voiced stop, in
accordance with the prenasalisation rule. Hence, the following examples are both
well-formed:
(10) /nɛɭaɭi/[nɛ.ɭɐ.ɭi] ~ [nɛ.ⁿɖɐ.ɭi] ‘he is doing’but this example is ill-formed:
(11) /nɛɭaɭi/*[nɛ.ɖɐ.ɭi]‘he is doing’Kwomtari speakers’ pronunciation of Tok Pisin seems to be influenced by this
prenasalisation, for example nogut ‘bad’ is sometimes pronounced [nɔŋɡut].","[48, 49]"
"20Kwomtari Phonology21/b/ occurs as a voiced bilabial plosive [b].
/g/ occurs as a voiced velar plosive [g].
/m/ occurs as a voiced bilabial nasal [m].
/n/ occurs as a voiced alveolar nasal [n].
/s/ occurs as a voiceless alveolar grooved fricative [s].
/r/ occurs as a voiced alveolar trill [r].
The phoneme /ɭ/ occurs as either [ɭ], a voiced retroflex lateral, or [ɖ] a voiced
retroflex plosive, in free variation in all environments. There is a slight preference
for the lateral rather than the plosive following a consonant in a consonant cluster.
There is occasional phonological conditioning by the prenasalisation rule
explained in §3.3. Occasionally either phone may be produced in a manner that is
not apparently retroflexed, but this is not phonologically conditioned. Examples of
this free variation are given in (1):
[ɭi] ~ [ɖi]‘tongue’/ɭiɭu/[ɭiɭu] ~ [ɖiɖu]‘skin’/ɭɛtinɛ/[ɭɛtinɛ] ~ [ɖɛtinɛ]‘make’/kɭine/[kɭinɛ] ~ [kɖinɛ]‘bamboo hooked arrow’/boɭu/[bɔɭu] ~ [bɔɖu]‘noise’/buɭari/[buɭɐri] ~ [buɖɐri]‘crest of cassowary’(1) /ɭi/The bilabial fricative /ɸ/ has two allophones in complementary distribution,
occurring as the voiceless allophone [ɸ] word-initially and becoming voiced [β]
intervocalically. Examples are given in (2):
(2)/ɸɔri/[ɸɔri]‘pig’/ɸutɛni/[ɸutɛni]‘ear’/ɡɭɛɸɛ/[ɡɭɛβɛ]‘why?’/kɭiɸu/[kɭiβu]‘dog’/ɸiɸɛ/[ɸiβɛ]‘excrement’22Kwomtari PhonologyThe bilabial fricative and all plosives may occur as the first member of a
consonant cluster, with either /r/ or /ɭ/ as the second member. In these consonant
clusters, both consonants are members of the same syllable; refer to the discussion
in §4.
Minimal pairs exhibiting the contrasts between these phonemes are given in
(3), in two positions wherever possible:

The Kwomtari vowel inventory is shown in table 2.","[30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"
"Kwomtari Grammar69The mismatches between subject and other syntactic roles in marking pronoun
number suggest the distinctions may be recent. This may be due to change in the
language as a result of contact with neighbouring languages and Tok Pisin, which
have a clear distinction between singular and plural pronouns.
The pronouns une and mena can be joined to make une-mena ‘first person
inclusive plural’. This contrasts with mene weife ‘we two’, which may be inclusive or
exclusive of the hearer.
The pronouns in the second set are less commonly used. No second person
pronoun has been recorded for this set. The pronouns found for set 2 are listed in

Mwa ‘no’ sometimes indicates an adversative relationship like ‘but’.","[164, 165]"
"Kwomtari Grammar151If the predicate is verbal, the negated verb takes the suffix -i in addition to being
preceded by glei. It appears that -i is used to give clarification as to how much of a
sentence is being negated, since the scope of glei can extend over more than one verb.
Note that when -i follows the 3rd singular realis suffix -lee, -ee drops out and only -i
is evident. The negating suffix -i is homophonous with the clausal suffix -i showing
simultaneous action, and may sometimes have been confused with it.

Mwa ‘no’ can also be used to clarify the scope of negation much as -i does, by
being placed after the clause, as discussed previously (§5.3.1). This is illustrated in

Relative clauses are formed by nominalising the verb with the suffix -lu. In the
majority of cases found in the data corpus, the relative clause precedes the noun it152Kwomtari Grammarmodifies. This contrasts with adjectival modifiers, which for inanimate nouns
generally follow the noun being modified. The fronting of the relative clause in the
noun phrase is due to it being a specifying constituent. In the following examples, the
relativised clause is underlined for clarity. Examples (28) and (29) show the
formation of restrictive relative clauses (relative clauses specifying the identity of the
head noun):
(28) tiafwi pipirine-ie-lu bwali
snake kill-1S.R-NN shell.ring
‘snake-killing-shell.ring’ (rings used in a snake-killing procedure)
na
(29) Lumi-fu
lufwa Gote-lu kaisekli feta-lee-lu
Lumi-ABL man God-NN strength see-3S.R-NN word
‘story about a man from Lumi seeing God’s strength’
In example (30) the relative clause functions as a qualifier instead of a specifier
and follows the noun phrase it modifies:
Gote le-te-lee-lu
(30) ka telu Aie
tree some father.1/2 God do-3P.O-3S.R-NN
‘some trees, which Father God made’8. Sentence structure
8.1 Simple sentences
A simple sentence contains one clause, which is marked on the verb for status realis or irrealis. The default status is realis, so this is the status assumed when the
predicate is nonverbal. The clause functions as the sentence base, and is associated
with a typical intonation.1 Examples (1) - (5) are examples of simple sentences:
(1) Nariemu-le ite-i
gria-le-lee.
wife-GL
house-LOC leave-do-3S.R
‘He left his wife at home.’
(2) Mene kotue
na-fo-fe.
1NPL tomorrow say-3S.O-1S.IR
‘I’ll tell him tomorrow.’
(3) Lie gaga le-la-lee-o.
sun heat do-P.DUR-3S.R-VOC
‘The sun is hot.’ (Lit. ‘The sun’s heat is doing.’)
(4) Lufwa ari-le

‘The men beat the children.’
(5) Nanu una-ne ari fane-o-be.
3.PN 2.PN-GL child give-1/2S.O-3S.IR
‘She will give the child to you.’
The sentence may also contain constituents that are external to the main clause.
Dik (1991:19) describes this type of constituent as a ‘theme’. Themes convey
pragmatic information, e.g. highlighting a sentential topic or focus, presenting an1[Editors’ note] Unfortunately, time did not allow for acoustic analysis of the intonation patterns of the
language, so this comment is based on the researcher’s aural impressions.","[160, 161, 162, 163]"

Verbs are the major open word class in Kwomtari other than nouns. Verbs are
easily distinguished as they are always marked for subject. They also uniquely take a
set of object markers and a pair of aspect markers (see table 12). This chapter begins
with a discussion of the semantic features of verb stems (§4.1), then discusses the
affixes found on Kwomtari verbs (§4.2) and concludes with a description of the verb
phrase (§4.3).","[106, 107, 108]"

Mwa is used in an exclamation with metie ‘really’, expressing extreme surprise:

The adverb glei ‘not’ negates the predicate and is usually found as the initial
element in the predicate. Glei can negate all the predicates linked to one subject, as in
(34). Glei is used in conjunction with the clause final negative suffix -i, which is
discussed further in §7.2.

The adverb kose ‘lest’ occurs most commonly in negative imperatives along with
the prohibitive mani, as in example (36):Kwomtari Grammar133(36) Une kose biakwai-le-lu mani.
2NPL lest drunk-do-2S.R PHB
‘You must not get drunk.’
It can also occur in irrealis sentences without mani to express a hope that the
event will not occur.

When kose is reduplicated and followed by -fe ‘RSN’, the resulting construction
means something is ‘fake’ or a ‘lie’:

RED-lest-RSN RED-shell.ring do.them-3S.O-3S.R-SEQ
‘He made fake shell-rings1 for it (i.e. the snake – to catch it)…’5.4 Deictic adverbs
Deictic adverbs are based on the morpheme se encoding approximation. They are
glossed ‘thus’ and either recapitulate the event or events or refer to them
cataphorically. The most commonly used deictic adverb is eese, with ee marking
close proximity, as it does in the demonstrative eete of §2.4. The unmarked se also
occurs quite commonly. The difference between eese and se in meaning and function
is not clear. The adverb is phonologically bound to the verb, so eese-a-lee is
pronounced eesalee.

pronouns (see example (40)), as can numbers. Bofu can also precede a noun, and then
functions as a specifier – the speaker has a particular entity in mind.

showing a contrast in analogous environment between [u] and [w], which suggests
the possibility of [w] being a phoneme, rather than merely an allophone of /u/:
(15) /uabɛ/[wɐ.bɛ]‘he will go’[u.wɐ.bɛ]‘type of edible greens’[wɐ]‘go’/u̞a/[u̞.wɐ]‘look there’(17) /wɛi/[wɛi]‘yes’[u.wɛ.si]‘mucus’/uabɛ/
(16) /ua//uɛsi/However, examples (15) and (16) are dubious. In (15), the word for these type
of greens has also been recorded as [ɭuɐbɛ]. This suggests the possibility of a
diachronic cause for the form [uwɐbɛ]: perhaps the retroflex lateral has been
omitted but the word has not completed its change to become [wabe] in
accordance with the proposed rule yet. In example (16), the word [u̞wɐ] ‘look
there’ contains a morpheme break which is likely to influence the phonology. This
word is made up of two morphemes: /u̞/,‘eye’ and /ua/, ‘go’; literally meaning ‘put
your eyes over there’. This still leaves (17), where for some reason, the first part
of the desyllabification rule does not seem to apply, but I am reluctant to upgrade
[w] to phonemic status on the basis of one word. Possibly the initial phoneme is
/u̞/, rather than /u/, and /u̞/does not cause labialisation.","[50, 51]"

The structure of the postpositional phrase is:
(NP / Clause / PP) Postposition.
The modal outlook postpositions (set 1) relate back to the entity they mark, which
can be a noun, a noun phrase, or a whole clause. The postposition adds the speaker’s
perspective of the marked phrase/clause. The postpositional phrase occurs in the place
that the noun, noun phrase or clause would normally occur.

‘Shall we go “goggling” (i.e. diving with goggles to hunt crocodiles)?’
The postpositional phrases relating nouns to each other (set 2) generally consist
of noun phrase plus postposition, as in (88) and (89), though -lu also suffixes to
clauses (90):

occur in the verb phrase, always preceding the verb. This pattern is illustrated for
intransitive clauses in (91):
(91) Ambo-fe wa-lee.
bush-RSN go-3S.R
‘He went to the bush.’
In transitive clauses, set 3 postpositional phrases generally occur between the
goal and the verb, as in (92) and (93):

FOC water-COM wash-say-3S.R-SEQ FOC medicine-COM tie-3S.R
‘She washed it with water, then bandaged it with medicine (ointment?).’
When the verb phrase contains a compound verb consisting of a generic verb
preceded by a noun phrase, the postpositional phrase precedes the entire compound
verb. This is illustrated in (95) and (96):
(95) Inali

pig man body-COM pig body-COM do-3S.R-NN account
‘(It is the) account of a pig which had both a pig’s body and a man’s
body (split down the middle).’8
Sometimes postpositional phrases are moved to the sentence-initial theme
position; this is especially frequent with temporal postposition phrases. The content of
these postposition phrases is always a noun or noun phrase (as in (98)); the noun may
be a nominalised clause, as in (99), or a deverbal, as in (100) below.
[krie-tu]

modifying two clauses.

‘To see the sago blind, he went and I also went.’
Postpositional phrases can be recursively embedded. In (99) above, the
postposition -lu nominalises the clause lie gaga nelalee ‘the sun heats’, and in turn
the entire construction is embedded in a locative phrase by the locative postposition
-fi. In (101) below, the phrase Mena-nu aie-lu-fi is triply embedded in turn by the
postpositions -lu, -fi and -le. This is the normal construction for movement toward a
person:

The locational adverbs are all locative postpositional phrases in form (formed
from nouns with the locative postposition -i). They are discussed separately here
according to their adverbial semantic use. They also act as locative postpositions
themselves (see §3.3.1). The most common locational adverbs are:
mai
‘on top, high’
ambei
‘under, low’
menei
‘inside’ ( < meni-i ‘hole-LOC’)
bwakei ~ bagei ‘close’
roboi
‘close, soon’
eetei
‘here’ (this-LOC)
utei
‘over there’ (that-LOC)2
tei
‘here’ (a location just described)
(FOC-LOC)
The following examples show the locational adverbs in use:
(46) Eete-i-se
teme-le-a!

‘Stand here!’
(47) Afteli! Lie oo-lu

child woman-GL close-LOC do-3S.O-P.DUR-3S.R
‘The child is soon to be born.’ (Lit. ‘The child is close to doing to the

The morpheme tie may have an exclamatory or modal function. It occurs in the
words metie ‘really’, ‘truly’ (< me ‘CER’+ tie) and tetie ‘enough’, ‘all right’ (< te
‘FOC’ + tie). Other than in these two words, there is only one instance of tie in the
current corpus of data. This occurrence is in eketie (< eke ‘there’ + tie). Both these
adverbs often lose their -e ending when closely linked with a postposition, for
example teti-pe, teti-mai, meti-mwa.

other entities for it to compare to. For example, if two or three men went hunting and
one shot something special, that one could refer to himself as menete when saying1[Editors’ note] In this section and §6.1.1, Spencer originally used the words ‘topic’ and ‘topical’ in all
places where ‘focus’ and ‘focal’ now appear. The change was made because the use of ‘topic’ in the
original manuscript was inconsistent with the general usage in the literature (e.g. Payne 1997:270271). The term ‘focus’ can be taken as referring generally to the new information the speaker wishes
the addressee to pay attention to (cf Payne 1997:266-271). Apart from terminology, Spencer’s analysis
is unchanged.","[88, 89]"

Behavioural evidences of continuing traditional culture include the
use of magic by some to counteract evil and sickness as well as that
for hunting and fishing. Singsings are local and sung in tok ples.11
Traditional stories are known and told by those of Sukwari’s
generation (45+). There is some segregation of men and women’s
duties as well as of living quarters (among young unmarried men)
and sleeping quarters (within the familial longhouses).
Nineteen years later there is still material and behavioural evidence that a
traditional culture remains intact. Development has not impacted traditional lifestyle
as much in the Kwomtari area as in other parts of PNG that are closer to towns and
have road access. Much of this is expected to change in the near future when the
planned timber operations begin.
House construction has changed very little. Nails are preferred in the main
supporting beams and in the construction of ‘rung’ ladders as opposed to the
traditional notched log. The latter are still often used for the cookhouse, where some
of the women prefer to do their cooking. Many of the houses now have a shuttered
opening like a window to let in light during the day, but it would never remain open
for the night for fear of spirits. Most families still follow the traditional pattern of
segregated sleeping areas on separate sides of the longhouse around their own
firepits. The young unmarried men’s house perhaps shows the greatest change. In
Baifeni village this longhouse is separated into individual rooms with padlocks on the
doors.
The interior of the houses, with their collections of traditional items, remain much
the same. Added to the Western items, one now sees mosquito nets and occasionally
mattresses and bedsheets, along with electric torches and kerosene lamps. Each
village would have at least one radio.","[17, 18]"

Exceptions to this include the verbs tiale ‘flee’ and pipinane (=pipinale) ‘run’, which
lose -le or -ne when -fwa is suffixed, becoming simply tiafwa and pipinafwa.
The suffixes -fwa, -tuwa and -fere, -tere have taken on broader meanings. The

not significant.
Kwomtari grammar shows many features typical of Papuan languages or of the
Sepik region. Core noun phrases take nominative-accusative agreement, and
constituent order is SOV. Subject and object are cross-referenced by verbal suffixes,
which contradicts statements made by Laycock (1973, 1975) and Wurm (1982:246).
Subjects lack case marking, while objects of transitive verbs take the same case
marking as recipients of ditransitive verbs. This case marking system is common in
the Sepik-Ramu region (Foley 2005:134), although Kwomtari lacks the distinction
between animate and inanimate objects found in other languages. Complex actions
are expressed by a generic verb preceded by an adjunct noun. Sentences are formed
from chains of medial clauses terminating in an independent clause.
Other features of Kwomtari grammar are more distinctive. Kwomtari appears to
be the first attested example of a Papuan language with a quinary case system for
oblique nominals (cf Foley 1986:101): location, goal of movement, source of
movement, instrument and cause all have distinct postpositions. Kwomtari lacks
gender or other classifiers, despite being surrounded by languages with one or more
noun classification systems. Medial verbs lack switch-reference marking, while
independent verbs are inflected for status (mood) and aspect, but not tense. Pronouns
are only distinguished for number with first and second person subjects; in other
syntactic roles and in third person, number distinctions are neutralised. Marking of
pragmatic focus is central to the grammatical system.","[23, 24]"
"6Introductionplanted in their gardens. Watermelon, pineapples and cucumbers are more recent
additions to the various local fruits. Coconut and betel nut palms grow in and around
the villages. Sago, the main staple of their diet, grows unaided in the swamps. Most
families live off their own garden produce and what they forage from the rainforest
with minimal need for cash. The men hunt with bows and arrows, bringing home wild
pig and cassowary meat, which are usually shared with the entire village. Smaller
catches, such as possums, snakes, lizards, birds, and bush rats, are eaten within each
family unit. Crocodiles are also hunted for their meat and hide. The villages further to
the south hunt small deer. Other sources of protein include various nuts, grubs and
fowl eggs. At times people catch young pigs and cassowaries to raise in the village,
either for a feast or as a source of income.
Clans are patrilineal. There are recognized clan leaders within each clan.
Leadership is passed down to the oldest male within the clan. Clans continue to be a
very significant part of the social structure. Marriages are made in order to strengthen
relationships between clans, and are arranged by the male relatives of both parties. A
sister exchange may not be arranged within the same clan. Two instances are known
in which a man married someone from within his clan; both were met by opposition
from other clan members and the community at large. Arranged marriages remain the
norm, but the age of marriage for girls has risen to about the 16-20 year age range, as
opposed to 13-16 years. Generally, if a girl is in school, parents will postpone
marriage. It is common for a man to have two wives. A man will also marry his
brother’s widow.
The Kwomtari are animistic. Their fear of spirits permeates their way of life
affecting their daily actions and responses to people. Spirits are neither good nor bad,
having the ability to do good or to harm. Uppermost in the minds of the people is the
need to avoid offending either an individual, who could hire a sorcerer, or the spirits
themselves, and to know how to appease them. A sorcerer has the ability to
manipulate the spirits and can be paid for his services. Sickness and death are most
often attributed to a spiritual attack. The use of magic to counteract evil and sickness
is commonplace. Ceremonial dances (singsings in Tok Pisin), with their elaborate
preparations, are still performed to appease the spirits when someone is very ill. They
are also much enjoyed as a community activity, viewed as harmless in this context,
perhaps as a way of passing on the tradition.
Some vivid observations on Kwomtari culture in 1989 were made by Landweer
and Toivanen:Introduction7There is both material and behavioural evidence of a continuing
traditional culture.
There were longhouses in each village, which except for the
occasional nailed ladder, were entirely constructed of bush materials.
With the exception of one ‘western styled two storey’ house in
Yanebi (now abandoned in severe decay), all the houses were of
traditional fashion; windowless with two or more doors, a high
morota roof with long overhanging eaves, ‘sewn’ pangal walls and
limbum floors.6 The houses were built on posts anywhere from 4 to 8
feet [i.e. 1.2 to 2.4 metres] off the ground and are typically entered by
notched log ladders. In addition to the family centred longhouses,
each village had a young unmarried man’s house, and haus win.7 Of
the latter structures one in Wagreni was set up for women’s
communal cooking.
Inside the houses one sees a collection of traditional hunting,
gathering and cooking implements: bows, arrows, spears (often
highly decorated and diversified in fashion according to intended
function); fishing nets (umbens), loosely woven baskets, tree branch
hooks, and bark string bilums8. Other miscellaneous items noted are
pigs, croc[odile] and cassowary skulls or bones; limbum flower
brooms, and singsing bilas9 including shields and bird feathers.
About ¼ of the women wear purpurs of twisted saksak fibre.10 At
least 90% of the female population had facial tattoos, which we were
told were applied when they were children according to the desired
design of their mothers…
Western material evidenced included occasional nails, second hand

"1.3.3 Linguistic classification
The classification of Kwomtari is controversial. It is generally agreed that the
language cannot be assigned to the Trans New Guinea family or any of the other
major families (Wurm and McElhanon 1975:156; Ross 2005). Loving and Bass
(1964), on the basis of lexical similarity between 4% and 12% measured against 180word Swadesh wordlists, grouped Kwomtari, Nai (Biaka), Fas and Baibai together as
the ‘Kwomtari phylum’. Within this larger grouping, they distinguished two pairs of
languages showing greater similarity to each other; Kwomtari was paired with Nai,
and Fas with Baibai.
Laycock (1973, 1975) reversed these subgroupings, pairing Kwomtari with Fas,
and Baibai with Nai. Since he did not state the basis for this reversal, it is difficult to
determine his reasons, although he stated his classifications were not ‘based onIntroduction13detailed lexicostatistic analysis or comparison’, but were ‘impressionistic… the
accumulated effects of…noting resemblances and differences as they emerged’
(1973:2). It is likely that his criterion was grammatical structure, since he concluded
that Kwomtari and Fas both lack verbal subject concordance; this conclusion is now
known to be incorrect (see below). Nevertheless, Laycock’s prominence has ensured
that his subgroupings of the languages have been until recently the basis of most
published classifications, e.g. in Ethnologue (Gordon 2005). Laycock also added to
the ‘Kwomtari phylum’ Pyu, a language on the PNG-Indonesian border.
Baron (1983b) took 100-word lists in each of the languages to assess the validity
of these rival classifications, again using the criterion of lexical similarity. In the
process, he also established the separate status of Guriaso. Baron’s results support the
original subgrouping by Loving and Bass. He finds that Kwomtari and Nai are
closely related, and Guriaso somewhat more distantly related to both; there is also a
close relationship between Fas and Baibai, but not strong evidence of a relationship
between them and the Kwomtari-Nai-Guriaso grouping. Why Baron’s survey was not
published is unclear, but it has now at last been posted on the web.13 Any definitive
grouping of the Kwomtari languages must depend on the application of the historicalcomparative method; however, Baron’s greater methodological rigour and Laycock’s
lack of engagement with previous work mean that Baron’s classification must be
considered more reliable.
A recent development is the suggestion by Ross (2005:30) of a relationship
between the Kwomtari family and the Arai (Left May) family, based on pronoun
similarities.","[22, 23]"
"4. Phonological processes
4.1 Labialisation
Where /u/ and /u̞/ follow consonants and precede another vowel, they are
commonly desyllabified and realised as labialisation of the preceding consonant.
Examples of labialisation are shown in (1) below.
(1)/takuɔni/[tɐ.kʷɔ.ni]‘floor’/kuɔru/[kʷɔ.ru]‘bow’/makuɔi/[mɐ.kʷɔi]‘type of arrow’/ɡuaiɛ/[ɡʷɐi.jɛ]‘cassowary’/nabui/[nɐ. ͫbʷi]‘blazing’/buaɭi/[bʷɐ.ɭi]‘shell ring money’/ɸui/[ɸʷi]‘coconut’/tiaɸui/[ti.jɐ.βʷi]‘snake’ (generic term)/muamɔɭɛ/[mʷɐ.mɔ.ɭɛ]‘one’In Kwomtari, the most commonly labialised consonants are velar; bilabial
consonants also show examples of labialisation but are less frequently
encountered. This is in accordance with the universal trend for labialisation to
occur most commonly with velars, and somewhat less frequently with bilabials
(Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996:356). There are no examples of labialised
coronal consonants. The examples in (2) below show that coronal consonants are
not subject to labialisation:36Kwomtari Phonology(2)37/tuɔɭu/[tu.wɔ.ɭu]‘egg’/prɔnuɛ/[prɔ.nu.wɛ]‘insert’/kuasuɛ/[kʷɐ.su.wɛ]‘bamboo arrow’/ɭuɛ/[ɭu.wɛ]‘sleep’/tui/[tu.wi]‘prostitute’/aruɛ/[ɐ.ru.wɛ]‘carry’Labialisation also seems to be blocked preceding /ɛ/, as in example (3). It is
unclear why this is the case.
(3)/abuɛ/[ɐ. ͫbu.wɛ]‘grandkin’/puɛ/[pu.wɛ]‘dig’There are two apparent exceptions, shown in (4):
(4)/bubua/[bu.bu.wɐ]‘beat’/ɭəbuɛmu/ (?)[ɭə.bu.wə.mu]‘bone-tipped arrow’In the second example, the phonetic schwa following [u] may be /ɛ/
underlyingly, since /ɛ/ can be reduced to [ə] in any environment. This would
explain why /b/ is not labialised. There are other examples where schwa follows a
labialised consonant, as in (5) below. These examples support the analysis that
schwa is a phoneme in its own right, and not just an allophone of /ɛ/ (refer to
§2.2):
(5)/mɔtukuə/[mɔ.tu.kʷə]‘many’/tɐtukuə/[tɐ.tu.kʷə]‘finish’/rukuə/[ru.kʷə]‘shovel’When our language advisors write words with labialised consonants, they
sometimes write <w>, sometimes <u>, sometimes <o> and sometimes the
labialisation is unmarked. I am not surprised that both <w> and <u> are used; I
suggest that <o> is written when labialisation is caused by /u̞/, rather than /u/.
Labialisation is also often written as <o> before a low vowel, which may suggest
that the position of the lips is more open before low vowels than high vowels. I am
not sure why labialisation sometimes is unwritten, but it is notable that38Kwomtari Phonologylabialisation is always written in words where there is an unlabialised minimal pair
counterpart, as in the case of bali ‘garden’ and bwali ‘shell ring money’.
Labialisation occurs before syllabification. When a non-coronal consonant is
followed by /u/ and then another high vowel (thus a vowel of the same height as
the underlying /u/), labialisation occurs first, and then syllabification. This ensures
that the two vowels remain part of the same syllable despite being the same
height. For example:
(6)/mui/[mʷi]‘salt’/ɸui/[ɸʷi]‘coconut’Both these words are monosyllabic. The same is also true of all words in
which [w] is clearly derived from labialisation of [u] in a component morpheme,
even those where the vowel following the /w/ is considerably lower. This supports
the analysis that /u/ becomes a semi-vowel – taking on consonantal characteristics
– in this environment. Semi-vowels will be discussed in more detail in §4.3.","[45, 46, 47, 48]"
"Kwomtari Grammar Essentialsby Katharine Spencer1. Introduction
Kwomtari is a Papuan language, spoken by people in six villages in the Sandaun
Province of Papua New Guinea, close to the border of Indonesia. These six villages
are divided into three dialect groups, with higher than 94% lexical similarity between
dialects. This paper is based on data collected from the dialect of Baifeni village. The
people of Baifeni call their language ‘Glefe’, from the word for ‘why’.
The corpus of data used in this analysis was collected mainly by Murray and
Carol Honsberger, between 1989 and 1998. In 1998, I and my colleague Julia Drew
were privileged to live and work with them among the people of Baifeni for nine
weeks, from early February to mid April. Working with the Summer Institute of
Linguistics under their ‘Graduate International Programme’ (GRIP), most of this time
was spent collecting more language data, Julia concentrating more on phonological
data and I on the grammar. Tomas Didiki and Yesefe Sukwari have been the principal
language advisors since 1989, but we were also advised by Dikson Gumute, Robert
Kosme and Lukas Dimeni (as well as numerous other villagers) during our nine-week
stay.
The data consists mainly of texts written by Kwomtari speakers during two
‘writers’ workshops’ – the first run by Frans Zandstra at Amanab and the second in
Baifeni village by Murray Honsberger, with men from each of the villages. Other
texts were collected on cassettes and transcribed by Murray. Only a few texts from
dialects other than Baifeni have been worked on, and then only after they were
adapted to Baifeni dialect. Also included is data elicited from language helpers. Texts
are presented in this paper using the practical orthography recommended in the
accompanying phonology paper by Julia Drew; additionally, the underlying
morphemes are shown, not the surface forms after the application of any
morphophonemic changes.
Kwomtari is an SOV language, while the order of suffixation on the verb is VOS.
There is no switch-reference system – participants in discourse are tracked by subject
marking on each clause. Kwomtari uses postpositions; the normal order in the noun
phrase is demonstrative, noun, adjective. Kwomtari has many two-phoneme particles,54Grammar Essentials55a number of which are homophonous. Kwomtari has a focus marker particle te which
is the base for demonstratives and conjunctions.
Thanks are due to Murray and Carol Honsberger and their children who
welcomed me warmly into their language programme; also to the people of Baifeni
village, especially the men mentioned above who gave much time to help me grasp
the grammar of their language. Thanks are also due to all those in England who have
supported me and enabled me to spend this time in Papua New Guinea, and to John
Roberts and others who were involved in the training for GRIP. Also to Julia and my
other friends here who have been a great encouragement. Special thanks are due to
Cindi Farr who has worked hard to help me analyse the more complicated parts of
this grammar and has suggested improvements to the paper.","[62, 63, 64, 65]"

"1.3.4 Typological overview
The phonology of Kwomtari is fairly straightforward, although unusually rich in
vowel phonemes compared with most Papuan languages. There are eleven
consonants; Kwomtari is distinctive in maintaining a four-way contrast between
voiceless stops, voiced stops, fricatives and nasals. The language has eight vowels,
which is one of the larger vowel systems recorded for Papuan languages (Foley
1986:54), although its near neighbour Imonda has a ten-vowel system (Seiler
1985:16). The most interesting feature of Kwomtari phonology is the presence of the
‘lowered-high’ vowels. These vowels, which contrast phonemically with the cardinal
high vowels, are pronounced in a raised close-mid position, but are not centralised as13Posted at http://www.kwomtari.net/kwomtari_survey.pdf. Refer also the discussions at:

The postposition -fu marks an entity as the origin of another entity. This marker
may be used within a noun phrase to show that the noun it modifies is the origin of
the head noun. In this case, the source precedes the head noun, as in (59) and (60):
lufwa

‘My ancestor from before did like this.’
This marker may also be used at the clausal level to show that a noun is the
source of the action of a verb. An example appears in (61). Note that in contrast to
(59), the noun phrase marked as source follows lufwa ‘man’, and therefore modifies
the verb:5
