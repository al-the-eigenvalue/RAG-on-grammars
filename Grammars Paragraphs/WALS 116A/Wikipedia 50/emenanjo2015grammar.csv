INTERROGATION
Preamble
Interrogation is concerned with the expression of questions. Questions can
be classified into three major types in terms of the type of answers expected.
(i)
Polar or Yes-No Questions.
The answers expected to these are: either a yes or a no, or an affirmation or
a rejection, as in: Will you come tomorrow?
(ii)
WH-Questions.
The answer expected to these are: pieces of information. Where will you meet
him? In English this class of questions uses an interrogatives (words) which
are often sub-classified into interrogative adjectives (e.g. who, which),
interrogative adverbs (e.g. why) or interrogative pronouns (e.g. who), all of
which begin with a WH.
(iii) Indirect Questions
These are either Yes-No or WH-Questions which are embedded as NP
sentential complements or simply subordinate clauses in sentences.","[422, 423, 424]"
"Finally, interrogation is used in the grammatical classification of verb forms
or sentence types which are usually in contrast to declarative or affirmative
forms, as in Figure XI.
The Position of Interrogation in Igbo
Igbo has the three types of questions identified above. Polar or Yes-No
Questions have already been treated in the different chapters on
Pronominalization and Cliticization in this book. We will therefore, focus in
this chapter on the two other types of questions, among other issues
concerned with interrogation, beginning with WH-Questions.
WH-Questions
Green and Igwe (1963), Nwachukwu (1976), Uwalaka, (1997), Goldsmith
(1981) among others have contributed variously to different aspects of
interrogation in Igbo.",[424]
"Like, in the Imperative, the Hortative is restricted to action verbs. For more
on the Hortative see chapter 19, and Emenanjo (1978:196-197).

These are used for asking questions.
They are marked by interrogatives, proclitics, tone patterns and
features of intonation.
They can be classified in terms of the answers they elicit, thus:
(i)Polar or Disjunctive Qs
• These elicit yes/no answers as in:
(38) Ò gà-àbia
Will he come?(ii)They admit of a Tag-system, as in:Tag-Qs
These are attached to the end of a statement so as to convey a
positive/affirmative or negative orientation.
(39)Ezè gà-àbia, ò bùkwà ya?
Eze will come, is it so?",[573]
"(51)Kèdu nkè i kwùrù: i na-abia kà ò bù ì naghī abia?
Which one are you saying: are you coming or are you not coming?(47) – (49) are polar alternative questions, while (50) – (51) are alternative
questions which really are made up of two separate questions: a WH-Q and
a Polar Q, each.",[435]
"Copyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.(39) – (41) are cases of polar questions with positive orientation while (41) –
(44) are, of negative orientation. Indeed, Polar Questions with positive
orientation have the nuances of exclamatory questions while those with
negative orientation have nuances of rhetorical questions.
Declarative Questions
This are essentially declarative or assertive questions couched as Polar
Questions.
(45)Ì nà-àsi nà ike agwula gi?
Are you saying that you are tired?",[434]
"This is a simple straightforward polar question which requires an
unambiguous yes or no. But certain sentences, while remaining denotative,
can imply other meanings from the scope of the meanings of words within it.
(21)O gà-àbia echīHe will come tomorrow.",[599]
"Who really did it?(b) Ònye di mèrè ya?
(c) Kè du‘How about?’Kè di
(d) Ka màkà ya‘How about it?(e) Kèe maka ya
Indirect Questions
Questions can be direct or indirect. Direct questions are full independent
clauses or sentences. Indirect questions are subordinate or dependent
clauses embedded in sentences. Both Polar and WH-questions can be
embedded in sentences, as indirect questions.
Polar Questions As Indirect Questions
Let us look at the following paradigms. Their glosses come at the and of the
Igbo text.",[429]
"In (36) – (38), the
(a)
forms are straightforward questions with interrogatives
(b)
forms are the periphrastic versions of (a)
(c)
forms contain the embedded questions
Other than in 38(c) the interrogative forms are converted to their cognate
noun equivalents by some morphophonemic rule.
The (c) in (36) – (38) contain the indirect questions of the (a). These
indirect questions are neither cases of noun phrase or interrogative
questions, as we saw with embedded polar questions, but of relative clauses
as we noticed with the periphrastic (b) forms of direct questions and of (34)
and (35).
By way of a summary:
(i)
Polar Qs are marked by low tone pronouns (among the morphemes)
in apposition to the NP.
(ii)
WH-Qs are marked by interrogatives followed by relative clauses.
(iii) Indirect Polar-Qs are marked by embedded interrogative
complements featuring low tone pronouns (among other
morphemes) in apposition to the NP.
(iv)
Indirect WH-Qs are marked by NPs featuring relative clauses.",[433]
"Other Features of Interrogation in Igbo

Yet, sometimes, an interrogative may be so presented that it elicits a positive
answer. In this case it has a positive or negative orientation, as in:

We have identified two types of alternative questions: one is like a Polar Q,
the other like a WH-Q.
(48)Ì chòrò egwu, kà ò bù mgba, kà ò bù ògù?
Do you want play or a wrestle or a fight?","[434, 435]"
"In (52) – (55) all essentially polar questions, there are nuances of positive
and negative assumptions, as well as neutral, positive and negative
expectations and, most times, strong doses of sarcasm, irony, disbelief,
uncertainty and impossibility!
Intonation and Interrogation
In the ethnography and pragmatics of Igbo speech, noun phrases can be
pronounced with a higher than high pitch as well as with lengthened vowels
and features of non-verbal communication to indicate something that is a
cross between a question and an exclamation. See:
ezi okwu
e: zi okwu
mmadù ìto
mmadù ìto o‘true word, truth’
‘Can this be true? Are you sure?
‘three persons’
Three persons? You mean three persons?",[436]
"In view of these glosses, Nwachukwu (1976), among a few others, have
raised issues about referring to the questions introduced by these
interrogatives as WH-Questions. He, therefore, suggests that WH-Questions
in Igbo should be called Kedu-Questions. It is interesting that aEmenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,391A Grammar of Contemporary Igboperiphrastic re-rendering of the use of some of the questions with a Kedu
head comes out as a WH-Q in English as in:
1(a)
(b)Ònyê kwùrù ya?
Kèdu onye kwuru ya?","[425, 426]"
"Tag-Qs
Igbo has its own realizations of these types of questions which involve an
assertion and then a question after. In the assertion, something positive is
said, and the listener’s response is required, as in:
(52)Ihe gī màsìrì Àda; ò bùkwa ya?
Ada loves you;
is it correct?",[435]
"Alternative Qs
These expect, as reply, two or more options demanded by the
question. These are in a sense a sub-type of Polar-Qs, as in:
(44)Ùnù chòrò òsikapa, kà ò bù jī, kà ò bù gàri?
Do you(pl.) want rice or (is it) yam, or (is it) gàri?",[574]
"Pronouns and Polar Questions
Perhaps, the distinguishing syntactic characteristic of (subject form)
pronouns is their use with low tones, alone, and in apposition to nouns or
noun phrases, with or without interrogatives, to introduce Polar questions,
in some varieties of Igbo, including Standard Igbo.
(22)O jèrè ahia.",[343]
"Cliticization and Interrogation
As hinted in Emenanjo (1973) and fully demonstrated in Emenanjo (1979),
one type of interrogation is marked by a floating low tone. This floating low
tone was shown to be realized on a ‘verbal prefix’ or ‘pronoun’.
Perhaps the distinguishing syntactic characteristic of pronouns
(subject forms) is their use with low tone alone or in apposition
to nouns or noun phrases and with or without interrogatives, to
introduce questions.
In Emenanjo (1979), however, with data from a number of non-contiguous
Igbo dialects which include Isukwuato, Òkigwe, Ehugbo (Afikpo), Òvim, …
(and) in parts of Ònìchà, Aguata, Umunnachī, we:
xmodified the Green and Igwe (1963:90, 109, 150), and Igwe
(1964:66) positions on interrogation – favoured by Abraham (1967),Emenanjo, Nolue.

Nwachukwu (1976).
xhave identified the type of questions that they are found with.
These are the polar ones.xre-established the floating low tone realized on some morpheme as
crucial to the marking of polar questions, in the lects of Igbo for
which data are available such as the Òhuhu of Umuahia, Aguata,
Njikoka and Idemili, and the Anioma lects.xre-established the position that there is some diachronic evidence
to support the contention that interrogation is marked by an
underlying low tone. Notice the tonal difference between these
cognate pairs of interrogatives and nouns, especially in their initial
syllables.8.(a)

surface structure is to be interpreted semantically as a question. In the
underlying structure, the constituent Question is therefore to be equatable

the monosyllabic noun or pronoun. So, the surface structure of the Polar
Question will be something like this in various dialects:

Observations
(i)
The (a) and (b) forms of (21) – (26) are the direct and indirect questions
respectively. The structure of the Indirect Questions is thus: Matrix
Sentence, QM Interrogative Complement where QM = Question Marker
or Complementizer = Conjunction. Notice that the Interrogative
Complement is exactly the same in all respects with the direct
question. These include the appositive pronouns which agree with
NP(s) in person and number, as well as in tonal behaviour. All have
low tones. In specific terms notice the differences as set out below:

"If we look closely at the meanings of (21) – (23), we will see that whereas (21)
merely emphasizes a future event, (22) adds ‘certainty’ to the event taking
place, while (23) adds ‘possibility’ to the event. In (21) – (23) the auxiliary gà, a function word, which is, essentially, a future marker has meanings
which affect the entire sentence. So, too, is the content word echi
‘tomorrow’. In other words, the scope of the meanings of the words gà and
echi affect the meaning of the entire sentence. (21) – (23) clearly show that
word meaning and sentence meaning are intimately related. We shall say
more about sentence meaning when we discuss semantic roles because
sentence meaning is as much an issue of the relationship between words
and constituents within a sentence as it is with semantic roles.
Unlike a sentence, an utterance is an extra-linguistic unit with
connotative meaning. Let us take another look at:
20(a) Nwàanyi à, ò nò nà di? Is this woman married?
The context or circumstances surrounding the utterance, with, possibly,
some non-verbal cues accompanying 20(a) may be demanding more than a
yes/no response. Her behaviour, dress, what she says and how she says
them – all these call to question her marital status. Indeed, 20(a) calls forEmenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,565A Grammar of Contemporary Igbomany possible interpretations because the question asks for more
information than that of the simple polar question that (20) is. This is
because whereas (20) is a sentence and no more, 20(a) is a sentence that
has become an utterance. (20) is to be studied in linguistics, while 20(a) is to
be studied in pragmatics. (20) is thus concerned with sentence meaning
while 20(a) is concerned with utterance meaning. Sentence meaning is
intra-linguistic and denotative. Utterance meaning is extra-linguistic,
connotative, pragmatic, affective, and/or social.
Towards a Classification of Meaning in Terms of Sense Relations
Meaning can also be classified in terms of sense relations and contents as
in:
Truth-Conditional Relations
The truth-conditional theory is one of the many approaches to meaning.
Although, like all the theories to meaning, it has its shortcomings, truthconditional relations do exist between sentences in human language and in
logic. This is because as Leech (1983:73) and other semanticists have rightly
pointed out:Copyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.","[599, 600]"
"‘Did you(sg) and I go to market?’In these same varieties, questions introduced elsewhere by low tones for
plural pronouns may have the low tone verbal prefix, in addition, as in:
30(a) Ùnù èjè ahia‘Did(pl.) you go to market?’(34)Hà èjè ahia‘Did they go to market?’(35)Ànyì èjè ahia‘Did we go to market?’In some other varieties the polar question, is marked by a low tone

Two questions arise from this approach to questions:Copyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.i. why do pronouns (in some dialects including Standard Igbo) carry
the low tone?, and
ii. what phrase structure corresponds to these pronominalized
surface forms?
The above entries presuppose that Igbo pronouns are in the deep structure.
But this assumption seems contradicted by some types of sentences where
(low tone) pronouns coexist with nouns, in agreement and in apposition (cf.
22)- (33). In (22) and (23), (30) and (31). A (floating) low tone before the verb
can be posited as basic to some types of questions. Certain cognate pairs of
interrogatives and nouns are evidence for a basic low tone in some question
forms as in:

onye ‘one who’:

"Notes:
(i)Some dialectal variants are included in parentheses.(ii)Subject forms are those which are used only as subjects of a
sentence. These have also been called ‘subjective forms’. (Adams)
and ‘Independent Pronouns’ (Welmers). Green and Igwe call some
of these, the ‘Inseparable pronouns’.(iii)Object forms are those used in non-subject positions, i.e. as direct
and indirect objects.(iv)The possessive forms shall, hereafter, be called pronominal
modifiers because syntactically, they modify nouns. Unlike the
subject and object forms, the pronominal modifiers are not nouns
since they cannot be used alone or as head of a two-word nominal
phrase. These pronominal modifiers belong with adjectives,
quantifiers and demonstratives in the form class of adjectivals.
This chapter is not concerned with pronominal modifiers. These
will be better discussed along with the other nominal modifiers, in
the chapter on adjectivization.(v)Pronominal forms can be monosyllabic or disyllabic.(vi)Singular subject forms are dependent or independent. Independent
pronouns, answer the question ‘who?’ alone.",[339]
"In a question with non-pronominal subjects, the low tone could nave thus
been incorporated on the final syllable of the NP. But this is not the case.
With respect to (ii), whatever PS we assign to such question forms, in
addition to ‘standing for’ nouns, Igbo pronouns coexist with nouns (24)–(29).
Pronouns: Particles, Affixes, Clitics or Concord Markers?
Are pronouns, articles, affixes, clitics or concord markers? It was once
argued sometime in the evolution of transformational grammar that
‘pronouns which originated as nouns in deep structure became articles in
surface structures’. The arguments of Jacobs and Roasenbaum are that:

"But the other form, ‘without the prefix’ is found in the ‘subordinate verb

ProQuest Ebook Central,8A Grammar of Contemporary IgboWestermann (1929) writing on the ‘Linguistic Situation and Vernacular
Literature’ in British West Africa observed:
In my tours, I collected records of ten or eleven dialects of Igbo
and talked with a number of educated Africans. We discussed,
among other matters, the question of dialects and I asked them
all the same question. “Do you when you leave your part of
the (Ibo) country use your own dialect or do you modify it?”
The answer in every case was: “We modify it.”
Ward (1935) in her “Linguistic Tour in Southern Nigeria” observed:
But the picture of the kinds of dialectal variations that occur
in Ibo country would be incomplete without a reference to the
way in which the Ibo in particular deal with them. Not only is
an intelligent Ibo pretty quickly able to understand and learn a
strange dialect, but there is undoubtedly a tendency for
strangers to modify their local speech when talking with
each other.

(1935) forthrightly observed:Copyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.","[42, 43]"
"It does appear that the low tone is an inherent marker of interrogation in the
language. Thus a floating low tone attaches itself to a pronoun, a concord
marker or a proclitic as we have shown in chapter 11, on pronominalization.
A Syntactic Classification of Interrogatives
It seems that one can classify the Igbo interrogatives into two, on the basis
of their ability to initiate questions and/or constitute questions without
additional structure, covert or overt. The two classes are:Copyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.",[427]
"The Dependent Interrogatives
The dependent interrogatives are those that obligatorily need other nominals
to initiate questions.
13(a) Òlee ebe o nò?
(b) *Òlee?",[428]
"‘Who is gone to the market?’The pairs (22, 23) and (30, 31) differ only by low tones in the pronouns in
the interrogative members of the pairs.
The pairs (24, 25), (26, 27) (28, 29) differ only by the insertion of a low
tone pronoun in apposition to the nominals.
Questions may be introduced by a low tone pronoun (32) or by
interrogative, ònye, alone (33), in what are really WH-Qs.
Some varieties of Igbo introduce questions by a low tone harmonizing
verbal prefix functioning as a concord marker, where otherwise we wouldEmenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,309A Grammar of Contemporary Igbohave a low tone pronoun in nominal (subject) position in apposition (cf. 25,
27, 29) which would respectively be:
25(a) Uzò èjèrè ahia‘Did Uzo go to market?’27(a) Àda nà Uzò èjèrè ahia?","[343, 344]"
"In the case of kèdu/kèdi, I suspect that it is derived from two morphemes:
xKà/kè used alone in some dialects as an independent interrogative
meaning ‘how’? + du/di a highly restricted enclitic, which marks
questions as in:20(a) Ònye du mèrè ya?",[429]
"More than others who have argued for transitivity, Nwachukwu is aware of
the enormous problems inherent in the assignment of this feature. Hence,
he resorts to a ‘combination of structural and notional approaches’ in his
analyses. As we have shown above there are many questions that this
approach has not answered, and cannot ever answer.
Uwalaka (1983: 7-15), aware that ‘Igbo transitivity cannot be defined
in surface syntactic terms’, posits pronominilization as the acid test for
direct object and, ipso facto, transitive verbs. The pronomilization test is
interesting. But it has the following drawbacks:Copyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.(i)it appears to be relevant only for the optional specific nouns into
which the general complements of the GCVs can be re-written. (In
passing we would like to add that OHI ‘theft’, far from being a ‘dummy
element’ as argued by Uwalaka, is the general complement of the verb
-zu ‘steal’. Since OHI involves concrete things, it can be spelt out only
in terms of concrete nouns such as: ego ‘money’; akwà ‘cloth’.
Because Ohi ‘theft’ is abstract as seen by Uwalaka, it cannot be
replaced by a pronoun. But each of its concrete realizations can be so
replaced.) The implication of this observation is that it is only GCVs
and some usages of ECVs that are sensitive to the pronominalization
test. Notice:
25(a)
(b)O zùrù ego
O zùrù ya‘He stole money’
‘He stole it.’26(a)
(b)O màrà mma
*O màrà ya‘He is good looking.’

"‘Did I buy meat?’Emenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,306A Grammar of Contemporary IgboIn some verb forms, one of the two forms of he pronoun is
certainly preferred to the other. Future auxiliaries and
subordinate questions take either:
(6)Agà m èje echī(7)M gà èje echī(8)O jùrù m mà ejèrè m(9)O jùrù m mà m jè‘I shall go tomorrow’.","[340, 341]"
"In the above cases of subordination, both the main clause and the
subordinate clause are syntactic categories in which the subordinators are
followed by complement or adjunct clauses which can be interpreted as
noun phrase complements as in (25), Indirect questions as in (26) clauses as
in (27) or adverbial clauses as adjuncts in (28) - (31) or to-infinitival nonfinite clauses as in (32).",[373]
"Furthermore, Nwigwe in her conclusion asserts that Declaratives and
Interrogatives share a morpho-syntactic relationship. All declarative and
interrogative sentences in the non-perfect indicative mood bear a low tone
nasal prefix N in Ngwa (= Ø in most other Igbo dialects).
Those in the perfective indicative mood bear a low tone harmonizing
vowel prefix, È. Floating tones remain, on the deletion of the prefixes.
According to Nwigwe ‘the interrogative sentences are transformations
of the declarative. The QWs, tonal modifications and syntactic variations are
not inflectional (but lexicalized) and cannot be a basis for the classification
of the interrogative as a distinct mood.
The general view held by some Igbo scholars that a low tone on
subject pronouns marks interrogation in Igbo applies to only affirmative
interrogative sentences. In the negative form the low tones become high. The
tone of the subject pronoun in interrogative sentences, is conditioned by
polarity. As our analyses of interrogation have shown, the situation is a lot
more complex than Nwigwe has shown. In fact, she seems to me to lump
Polar Questions with the floating low tones, and WH-Q (= her QWs).
Nwigwe finally concludes that ‘the interrogative’ is not a distinct mood
in Igbo. It is a subclass within the indicative mood’
The interrogative belongs to interrogation, which is a morphosyntactic phenomenon, with three major sets of verb forms or types: Polar,
WH, and Indirect.",[437]
"Emenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,314A Grammar of Contemporary IgboThis raises an interesting question because there are cases of floating tones
being realized on nouns, elsewhere in the tonal morphology. For example, in
the Indicative verb form a low tone is obligatory before the simple verb. A
terminal non-syllabic in the NP preceding the verb is automatically realized
as a non-low falling to low thus:
48(a)Chike jèrè ahia.(b)Chike jèrè ahia.49(a)Àda jèrè ahia.(b)Àdâ jèrè ahia.","[348, 349]"
"After the race, Chike called a party

(b) Àda nyèrè Chike òtu akwukwo màkà nà o hùrù yà n’anya.
Ada gave Chike a book because she loved him.
Sentences 46(a) and 47(a) are unacceptable backward pronominalization

of forward pronominalization. In Igbo, unlike English, the NP on the leftEmenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,312A Grammar of Contemporary Igbotakes the full lexical form leaving what Postal calls the co-referent on the
right, to end up in a pronominal shape.
In some dialects as we have already shown, the low tone question
morpheme appears on a harmonizing verbal prefix instead of a low tone
pronoun. With such data, then the appositional function of the currently
widespread position about pronouns in questions calls for further study.
Towards a Features Analysis of Igbo Pronouns
Personal pronouns probably originate as nouns or noun phrases in the deep
structure. They are thus segments with the features [+ N], [+ Pro.], [+
Anaphora]…, which are immediately dominated by N, which itself is
dominated by the NP in the deep structure. On this hypothesis, Carrell
(1970) maintains that it is via transformations rather than via lexical entries
that pronouns are given phonological shapes. She accordingly subcategorizes nouns as [± personal pronouns] and further sub-categorizes
personal pronouns as [± definite]. Other than the Impersonal pronoun which
is [- Definite], all other pronouns are [+ Definite]. Thus
[+ Def][± 3]The following handles the non-emphatic subject pronouns.","[346, 347]"

Is it just accidental that low tone concord markers and/or pronouns
in apposition to the NP, mark polar questions?
xIs it also just accidental that some of the interrogatives begin with low
tone vowels or a low tone syllabic nasal?xIs it also equally just accidental that the low tone pronoun, or concord
marker, following the complementizer mà has a low tone?","[426, 427]"
"Each of these six registers has its own phonological contours, tone unit or
tone group. Isn’t one of the functions of intonation that of signaling
grammatical structure (where it performs the same function as punctuation
in writing)? Isn’t intonation used to identify sentence, clause and other
boundaries as well as the contrast between grammatical structures such as
statements and questions? Again, isn’t one of the functions of intonation to
communicate personal (or modal) attitudes such as sarcasm, joy, formality,
hurt, grievance, annoyance?
Uguru (2000) has clearly shown that in the Ika variety of Igbo,
intonation is as relevant as tone. Ika has “six basic intonation patterns”
which perform grammatical, attitudinal and discoursal functions.",[168]

BE sentences can also be stative sentences marking location as in

We need to recollect that Igbo has stative verbs, the Stative verb form,
and the Factative verb form. Igbo Stative verbs, like stative verbs in other
languages, are not often used in the progressive aspect and rarely take the
Illative suffix =tA, except for idiomatic purposes. (Emenanjo 1978:140). The
Stative and the Factative verb forms have essentially identical semantic
interpretations. The only difference is that while the Stative verb form does
not take the =rV suffixes, the Factative takes the =rV suffixes. Compare (9) –
(14) which are in the Factative verb form, and (15) – (18) which are in the
Stative verb form. In some dialects the =rV is optional as in, (13) and (14).

Imperative-Progressive: Negative
The following are the features of this form:
(i)There is no NP(s) Nouns (or nominals) which are occasionally found
preceding the auxiliary. There NPs used, are not Subject NPs but
Vocatives!(ii)In some varieties, the progressive auxiliary, on a step tone and with
the prefix a-, is used, followed by the imperative negative marker =la.
See (12). In other varieties the two progressive auxiliaries are used
thus: adī (i.e. a high tone prefix followed by a step tone root) plus the
high tone –na. See (13).(iii) The participles retain their usual tone patterns.
(iv) The CPs behave as in the (Simple) Imperative: Affirmative.

and (13) are the direct negative equivalents of the affirmative (11).
The Imperative-Unfulfilled: Negative
This complex verb form seems to have only the negative form. The distinctive
features of this are:
(i)There is no NP(s). An NP in the Vocative is, however, possible.(ii)The Unfulfilled marker –ka, on a low tone and with a high tone aprefix, is followed by a participle to which is suffixed the Imperative
negative marker (=la/=na) which has a high tone.(iii) The CP changes or retains its inherent tones according to the tone
rules.","[555, 556, 557]"
"Like 26(a) and (b), 27(a) – (c), and 28(a) – (c) are stylistic variants. Each of
them contains an embedded relative clause which is marked by a downstep
on a morpheme which is na in 27(a) and 28(a), or ni in 27(c) and 28(c) or on
the auxiliary verb –na in 26(b). It is interesting to observe that the RM can
co-occur with the auxiliary verb in general 27(a) – (c) and 28(a) – (c) and the
durative auxiliary verb –na in 27(a) and 28(a). What is then the status of the
RM which can be either ni or na depending on the lect or idiolect? Given our
knowledge of universal morphology in general and Igbo morphology in
particular, this RM is a sub-class of clitics referred to as proclitics: ni / na
because they precede the words that host them or which hosts of the
floating downstep that essentially marks relativization.
The highlights of this chapter include:
(i)Igbo has clitics. Most of these are enclitics; two are prolitics.(ii)the proclitics are the hosts of the floating low tone which marks polar
and indirect questions and the floating downstep tone which marks
relativization.(iii)the contracted form it’s < It is in English, may be a case of
cliticization in English. It is not so with the deleted form in the
Prepositional phrase + N’ulò < na ulò ‘in the house’ or in the hortative
form k’anyi laa < kà ànyi laa ‘let us go’ in Igbo. The Igbo cases are
simply orthographic forms acceptable in writing the prepositonal
phrase when a noun beginning with a vowel follows the preposition.
This is not acceptable, however, when the noun beginning with a
vowel follows the hortative marker kà ‘let…, as Anagbogu (2001; 2004)
suggests.",[310]

ProQuest Ebook Central,148A Grammar of Contemporary IgboIndeed, the intrinsic interface, interdependence or modular relationship
between morphology and other levels of linguistics is fully captured by terms
like morphophonology/morphophonemics, phonomorphology (Gussman:
1985), and morphonology (Dressler, 1985). In traditional morphology and in
the morphological levels in Aronoff and Shrinder (1983), Selkirk (1988) and
in some of the essays in Everaerts (1988) the interface between morphology
and all levels of linguistics will be found. In generative morphology
(McCarthy’s 1995) ‘prosodic morphology’ and in Goldsmith’s many works in
metrical phonology, recognition is given to the interface between phonology
and morphology in non-linear/autosegmental morphology. Between
morphology, syntax-semantics, there is an ‘interlocking dependence’ (Baker
1988) and an ‘interface’ (Corbett 1982); Leiber (1980; 1988). Indeed, isn’t the
clitic a morpheme in which phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and
pragmatics meet? In phonosemantics, the interface between phonology,
morphology, semantics and pragmatics is an imperative. See chapter 25.
(ii)The second problematic issue in morphology is:What constitutes a word, or wordhood? What is a word?
Indeed, these two questions appear to be the two sides of one coin. Their
answers will depend on a number of factors with linguistic approaches,
orientations, levels of representation, being the determinants.","[182, 183]"
