and indefinite, and universal. There are five sets of independent
pronouns; the interrogative and indefinite pronouns can be used
with embedded questions. The universal pronouns are unique in

Suffix Position 11: AuditoryThis slot is filled by the single suffix -hawa-, which indicates thatThe word-final form, -ha, is unusual; comparativethe speaker knows of the action through hearing, but not seeing, theaction occur.*-hahwa-; in final position it would have had the form *-hahw,evidence indicates it should be *-haw. Perhaps originally the suffixwaswhich would have been pronounced *[haAW], with the final two
elements devoiced. Then the devoiced elements would have been
lost, in the same way that the apocopated form of the adverbial
suffix -ftfina-, -fi, was formed. Later, the medial form *-hahwawould have been restructured as -hawa-, since the cluster /hw/ does
not occur in monomorphemic words in Koasati.
The auditory suffix, structurally parallel to the hearsay suffix, is
the functional equivalent of a verb phrase followed by the switchreference marker -n and the verb hdzlon ‘to hear.’ It does not have
quite the transformational peculiarities of the hearsay suffix, for it
s rarely, if ever, used with verbs having a first or second person
iubject. The auditory suffix always has an impersonal flavor; that
s, ~hawa- is best translated by an English construction such as ‘one
van hear.’289)390)291)fpli-yacli-hawa-t

The basicKoasati, like other Muskogean languages, has a system of switchreference marking that indicates whether the subject of a clause hasreferred to:-ok for samesubjectforms of the switch-reference markers-are -k for a clause with an
identical following subject and -n for a clause with a different
following subject. These suffixes have forms with greater emphasis,reference and -on for different subject (see Nicklas, 1972:211 foror focus, as it is sometimesthey were unitary nominal or nominalizing morphemes that havedetails of a parallel system in Choctaw). In addition, the switchreference marker -p indicates that a new topic is being introduced
or that new information is being proferred. The switch-reference
suffixes are identical to the nominal case suffixes -k ‘nominative,’
-n ‘accusative,’ and -p ‘new topic.’ It seems likely that originallyexpression and a lack of the ambiguity that can occur in parallelbecome distinct from their distinctive uses.
Switch reference in Koasati is used to disambiguate actors in a
complex narrative, especially when there are two or more third
person subjects. This construction leads to a great economy ofkohté iyyi polt6kl aw4h cahappa:ka-n

56various verb classes is extremely complex and is not well understood
at the present. A full description of the origins of the verb classes
is beyond the scope of this work. Where it is deemed necessary,
historical matter will be included to aid comprehension, but no
complete diachronic description of the classes will be undertaken.
Each verbal class will be described separately, so far as possible.
At the beginning of each description will be given a skeleton outline
of the affirmative and negative subject cross-reference markers,
followed by a table of inflected examples. The tables will not
include an entry for the third person plural, as the third personform is used indifferently for singular or plural cross-reference. Thealongwiththeagentivenouns,which,becauseof theirprefix he-/oh-, considered by Haas and others to mark the third
person plural, is actually a distributive and indefinite prefix. It is
discussed along with the other verbal prefixes in chapter 4. In
addition to the subject cross-reference markers, the verbal noun will
be given in the tables for each verb that forms one, as the verbal
noun forms an essential part of the verb paradigm. The verbalnouns,multiplicity will not be given in the tables, will be discussed fully in
chapter 7. Finally, a list of verbs belonging to closed classes with a
small number of members will be given.
Class 1AThis is the only class in
the
first
conjugati
on that was discussed by
Haas. However, with the
discovery
of
class 1B it is now one of two
classes in the first conjugation.
Class
1A is typified by prefixing its
Subject cross-reference markers.
The negative subject crossreference markers are also prefixed; additionally the negativecomplement -9 is suffixed.* The roots that make up this class allhave the syllable structure CVCV or iCV. However, not all verbswith this syllable pattern belong to this class; wa:cin ‘to wait for’ isma ‘that,’ yé:fa ‘that (nearby); there,’ and méfa ‘that there; over
there.’ To further
complicate the situation, the verbs ynmin ‘io be so’ (the aspirate
d form of‘monster thatwhich
is yahhémmin—see chap, 9, Obsolete Internal Changes) and maémmin ‘to
happen,’There is one noun that has a phonemic nasal vowel, hghkdappear to be related,

addition to the case suffixes, which indicate the function of a noun
in the sentence, there are suffixes that indicate that the noun has
been previously mentioned and also locate that noun in time. Still
other suffixes supplant the case suffixes and serve discourse rather
than sentence functions.
Case SuffixesThere are seven different cases in Koasati, but no noun occurswith more than six. The classical terminology for cases will be usedto name the cases of Koasati, but it must be understood that the
functions of these cases may not be, in all instances, their classical
ones. With this in mind, the following are the cases of Koasati:nominative, accusative, autonomous, locative, allative, inessive, and

Of the two kinds of nouns that can be derived from verbs,verbal noun refers to an abstract or concrete nominal quality of a
verb, and the agentive noun refers to a person or an object that
performs an action or is typified by it. There are two kinds of
agentive nouns, regular agentive nouns, which are fully productive,
and nouns derived by old nominalization, which is no longer
productive.
Verbal Nounsultimate syllable of the noun, unless the penultimate syllable isA’verbal noun is a derived noun that refers to a quality of the
verb from which it is derived, such as ficcakhilkd ‘jealousy’ from
ficcakkin ‘to be jealous’ and cayahka ‘walking’ from cayéhlin ‘to
walk.’ Verbal nouns are essential to the verb paradigm, because
they serve functions similar to the English infinitive or gerund.
The verbal noun for verbs of all classes, except class 2A, is
formed from the first person plural affirmative form of the verb,
without phrase-terminal markers. The accent usually falls on thenaturally long, whereupon that syllable is accented. Thus, from the
verb hi:can ‘to see,’ where vowel length is not organic, the verbal
noun ilhica is formed; from halon ‘to hear,’ where vowel length is
organic, the noun ifha:la is formed. Frequently, as in ilha:la, the273If a noun must be derived from such a verb, it is thepermit the formation of two verbal nouns usually will; thus the
nouns wilapkact ‘a plow’ and wilapkaca ‘plowing’ are derived from

shape of the borrowed noun is incompatible with Koasati syllable
structure (i.c., when the noun is monosyllabic or terminates in a
consonant). If an English word is compatible with Koasati syllable
structure, it is borrowed without any additional morphology. For
example, the word mofor (the local dialect of English loses syllable-final r) has been taken into Koasati as mé:ta. (In such words as thisthe syllable that is stressed in English is lengthened and accented in
Koasati.) The suffix -ka seems to have been appended through the
interpretation that English personal names are equivalent toKoasati vocatives of names derived from verbs ending in -ka; in
such Koasati names, the element -ka is dropped in the vocative.
From personal names, the use of -ka apparently has been extendedto other nouns.
Frequently a word is borrowed ephemerally into Koasati from
English by means of the incorporative suffix -ka, for example
