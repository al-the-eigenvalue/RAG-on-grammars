’INTERROG’.
Interrogative pronouns are obligatorily sentence—initial
in
Warao questions.
Warao has only one general question word, sina 'who', which
substitutes For animates; and one, kasikaha ’what’, which
substitutes For inanimates. Some examples are oFFered in (44)(44) a. sina mayehe —bu —te

C: domu (ine hat —a —e

- ' (I speared) a bird'In Warao, the repeating of the verb in a yes/no echo
question is obligatory, such as it is shown in
(51). This
response may be preceded by the affirmative words nome 'yes'
and tuatane 'it is so', or the negative tuatane ana 'it is not
so' .
For question—word echo questions, responses are usually
reduced to the items that represent questioned constituents,
often in the absence of verbs, as exemplified in (52).
Interestingly, short answers to yes/no questions in Warao
exhibit a. peculiar phonology:
they are often more like
paralinguistic utterances than like ordinary morphemes, for
instance, affirmative uh—hunh and negative unh-uhn. which may
be furnished as answers in the language. These expressions are
nasalised since they must flow out through the nose given
total closure at lip level.
12. NEGATION
12.1. Simplex sentence negation (or main clause negation)
Negation is expressed by means of the suffix -naka 'NEG',
whose scope is the entire sentence. The negative marker —naka
'NEG' is directly attached to the verb root, possibly followed
by a mood marker if the need arises to indicate modality
overtly. It is convenient to state that all unmarked for mood
main clauses are in the indicative. Once —naka 'NEG' has been
added to the verb root, the inflectional markers for number
and aspect/tense appear on the auxiliary verb ta 'AUX'. For
example, the negative sentence in X53)27It
i:
t
(53) hirima
nao -naka ta -te
2sg.P0S -father come NEB AUX NON-PAST
'Your -father does not came’
Mouldhave an a-f-firmative counterpart asin(54)(54) hirima
nao -te
2sg.P0S -father come NON-PAST
’Your -father comes'iOther examples illustrating positional changes undergone by
verb in-flections in negative sentences are shown in the pairs
below
(55) a. ine namina -naka ta —bu -te
I
know
NEG AUX ITER NON-PAST
'I really do not know’
b. ine namina —bu -te
I
know
ITER NON-PAST
'I really know (it)’
(56) a. osibu
ine nahoro -naka -turu ta
morocoto I
eat
NEG
OPT AUX
(kind of
fish)
'I do not want to eat fish'-te
NON—PASTb. osibu
ine nahoro -turu ta -te
morokoto I
eat
OPT AUX NON-PAST
'I want to eat fish'
In (55), -naka ’NEG’ breaks the verb inflectional string,
inducing the presence of the auxiliary on which aspect j and
tense must appear. In (56) —naka ’NEG’ admits a followingjmood
marker,
in this case —turu 'OPT', which in turn disrupts the
verb inflectional chain, bringing about tense suffixing to the
auxiliary
(In Warao mood markers as well as negative, and
interrogative markers are closing morphemes, so they do, not,
allow further suffixing. Once they break the verb inflectional
chain, the auxiliary becomes the locus for tense/aspectj and
number markers. ISee 26.1.2.3. and 26.1.2.33.

12.2. Negation in some sentential constituents■Nominals, adverbials and postpositional phrases functioning
as objects and subject complements may be negated byi the
addition of the indefinite determiners ekira 'no' and, ana
’n o ’. ekira/ana 'no' postposed to a noun, an adverb and a
postpositional phrase form a sort of lexical item expressing
the antonym or the opposite. For example

participants in any syntactic role can be questioned.
For
example, (44a) and (44e) question subjects. (44b) questionsan
indirect
object and
(44c) questions an oblique.
(44d)
questions a direct object. (44f) and
(44g) question the
complement of the copula. Even, some elemets of a complex
quotative sentence may be questioned. For example, (6b) cited
above makes possible questions such as those in (45)(45) a. sina tira wab —a
—e
tatuma
who woman die PUNC PAST 3pl.□
ribu -n —a

b. kasikaha tatuma anibaka
what
3pl.O young girl
ribu —n —a
—e
—ra
say
sg PUNC PAST INTERROG
'What did the young girl say to them?’
Nevertheless,
other complex sentence types, in
which
embedding often causes main clauses to split, for instance,
the conditional sentence in (46) below
(46) airamo hiribu yatu nona —naka -kore
chief 2sg.POS word you do
NEG
COND
sabahi —te
scold
NON-PAST
'If you do not stick to his words, the chief will scold
you'24tend to avoid question-word questioning within the embedded
clause.
In this regard, no instance of questioned embedded
clause constituent by using question—words appears in the
Collected data. In addition to that fact, all the hypothetical
examples 'presented
to the informants
were
considered
ungrammatical.1
It is likely that the fronting of
the
questioned1constituent inherent to question-words brings about
syntactic complications that act as deterrant. Quotatives seem
to escape this restriction because the embedded clause, i.e.
the quote, precedes the entire main clause, which makes the
former behave as any initial object that needs not be further
moved from;its original position.
There is an alternative mechanism to question constituents
within embedded clauses in complex sentences. This implies the
use ;of sina 'who' and/or kasi kaha ’what’ preceding the
embedded clause provided that the main clause is left out, in
a treatment identical with echo questions. Such a treatment is
by thejWay:of illustration applied to (46), as shown in (47)(47) a. sina —ra
hi
ribu nona —naka —kore 0
who
INTERROG 2sg.F'OS say do
NEG
COND
’If who do not do as he (the chief) says?’
b. kasikaha —ra
yatu nona —naka —kore
what
INTERROG,you do
NEG
COND
’If you do not do what?’
s""Since the interrogative marker —ra ’INTERROG' only attaches
to main verbs, which in this particular context is absent, the
question-word themselves suffix them. This is a commonplace
procedure in Warao, more likely to take place in copulative
sentences in which the copula may be omitted, such as
exemplified in (44f).
To question constituents within postpositional phrases, the
corresponding head nouns must be replaced by the proper
interrogative pronoun. The following pair illustrate the case:
(48) a. atono
kaika oka naru —ki —tia
Antonio
with we go
INT HAB
(Anthony)
'We are going with Anthony as usual'25b. sina kaika ako naru -ki -tia -ra
who with we ga
INT HAB INTERROG
'With whom are we going as usual?'
(4 9 )a. tai a wahibaka wanari —a —e
he of canoe
sink
PUNC PAST
(lit.) 'The canoe of he sank’
b. sina a wahibaka wanari -a
—e
—ra
who of canoe
sink
PUNC PAST INTERROS
(lit.) 'The canoe of whom sank?', or
'Itlhose canoe sank'In the absence of interrogative pronouns to question about
place,
time,
quantity or amount, etc.,
(Warao
lacks
interrogatives with where, when, how many connotation), the
language uses sina 'who' and kasikaha 'what' as interrogative
determiners which modify nouns referring to location, time,
currency, price, etc., giving the idea of what place?. what
day?, what Quantity?, who individual?, etc. Some examples are
shown in (50)
(50) a. kasikaha ama a hokahi
what
moment of sun
(to)dayeku
in(side)naru —te
—ra

NON-PAST INTERR06

'When da/will you leave?'
b. sina warao -tuma yaota rubohi —te
-ra
who Warao PL
work hurry
NON—PAST INTERROG
'What Warao da/will hurry the work?’
11.3. Echo questions
Warao echo questions require no special answer words. Simple
affirmative or negative responses to questions may involve
repeating the verb of the question, with or without additional
material:
YES/NO ECHO QUESTION
(51) A: ama a hokahi ata oka yaota -te
(to)day
in we work
NON—PAST
'We are work today'
B: (ama a hokahi ata) yatu yaota -te
-ra
today
in
you work
NON-PAST INTERROG
'Do you work today?'","[30, 31, 32, 33]"
"QUESTIONSQuestioning in Uarao involves the obligatory suffixing of
the verbal
interrogative marker —ra 'INTERROG' . This is •- a
closing suffix within any chain Qf inflectional morphemes
attached to any main verb (verbs in embedded clauses do not
question mark). For example
(40) noboto yahinoto —ya tobe
yawar —a
—e
—ra
child burrow
ALL jaguar pull
PUNC PAST INTERROG
(myth.) 'Did the jaguar pull the child to its burrow?'
However, —ra ’INTERROG’ cannot be directly attached after
the negation marker -naka 'NEG' as well as same mood markers
that break the verbal inflection string. In those cases, —ra
'INTERROG'
is added to the auxiliary ta 'AUX', which is a
locus for tense,
aspect and questioning, under specific
conditions. An example is presented in (41) below
(41) naba muhoko tatuma
river side of theywaba -komoni
die
NEG.POTt
—a ■ —e
-ra
AUX PUNC PAST INTERROG
'Couldn’t they die on that side of the river?’
-ra
'INTERROG'
must be present
in
those
contexts
corresponding to the following two types of questions:
(i)
yes/no questions, and (ii) question—word questions. Rising
intonation is associated with questioning. This matter has not
been sufficiently explored by the author though.",[29]
")•focuses it. Since the sentence ^initial positioning of new
information in- the language is implemented by the FOCUS

hanokosebe teku'va 'in(to) the "";vi1 lage’ in (70b). In (71c), the
FOCUSINB,., RULE jfrants the subject .waraa isaka ‘one Warao’ in a
way -similar to that in which the rule operates upon the
oblique in (70b). The moving of other sentential
constituents
in j (70b) and (71c) may be considered a consequence of the
operation of the'FOCUSINB RULE'to front those constituents
representing new information,' i.e. hanokosebe ekuva and warao
i saka. which are now ""centered on the stage""
(Brimes,
1975: 325) . i-The relocation of ithe abliques kasiri aisiko
‘with

'Your mother'OIn cases of elliptical answers to yes/no questions, such as
in (75), any constituent other than the verb may be left out.
For question-word questions (and echo questions as well), any
constituent may be elided.
(iv) Copulative sentences:
The copula is omitted very frequently. It seems that,
in
Warao, the copula is the LOCUS for past tense. Non—past tense
is not marked in the copula. The copula in this language is a
sort of semantically—empty dummy verb. Copulative sentences,
temporarily unmarked simply do not need the dummy carrier:
(77) a. dims
a kabesekuhu
irida
O
father of pair of pants bigness
'The pants of my father (are) big'38b. iboma -ma siborori ha —e

'.The girls were happy’
(y)-Passive constructions:
■.». I iJ ,.M ‘ I;;, Transitive subjects of passives1 may, or may not, be overtly
expressed, ! Occurrences of elliptical
passives
transitive
subjects usually imply identity across sentence boundaries,
i .e"". , their antecedents are in any preceding sentence.
In
Wariao
passives,
the agentive postposition
aisia
’by'
introduces the underlying transitive subject, whereas the verb
of the sentence (or the auxiliary, if necessary)
suffixes the
completive, past tense marker
’COMP’ and the perfective
aspect marker -ha 'PERF':
(7B) a. tama —ha a namu
ma
aisia nona —i
—ha
this NOM of container lsg.O by

0
aisia nona -i
—ha
this MOM of container
by
make COMP PERF
. ■ , ,i ’.The container of this one was made (He didn’t make
it, but someone else did)'
The elided transitive subject of the passive leaves the
postposition aisia
'by' as a trace, which makes eminently
clear that a doer exist, even when it remains unspecified.
(vi) Possessive phrases:ml uIn Warao, a-possessive noun phrases may be reduced by
eliding the possessor, with retention of the postposition
'of'. Elliptical a-possessives take place under anaphori
correspondences, depending upon who the speakers are and their
roles in the events being narrated:(79) a. tai a nibora ribu —n —a

"15. 'FOCUS -(Romero—Figueroa, 1985)Warao,. permits variations,, from the basic OS9 order. Far
example, S is moved to initial position in question—word
questioning: 1(66)i•siha tama — haribu —te •""■< who this NOM, say
;] ’Who says that?’—ra;NON—PAST INTERROB
it
33IThe sentence initial occurrence of S in
(66) may be
accounted -for by an obligatory rule of WH—QUESTION MOVEMENT.
In (66), the -focal point has been fronted. The concept focal
point or focus here is somewhat similar to that of new
information:
it applies to what is requested through the
question rather than to what is already common knowledge or
pressuposed. Thus, the fronting of the focus is a dominant
device far question formation in Warao. Since all major
sentence constituents may be questioned in the language, when
WH-movement operates upon sentences having multiple objects,
i.e., sentences containing direct objects plus
indirect
objects
with or without obliques, or sentences containing
several oblique objects, such movements have the effect of
reversing the position of some of them respecting the others.
Far instance, the questioning of the direct object of i a
sentence such as in (67)
(67) buare
aisiko ibure
hua
n
machete
with
wild pig Juan
kill
(big knife)
(John)
'John killed a wild pig with a machete'-a
-e
PUNC PASTimplies the fronting of such a direct abject which makes the
oblique appear after the direct object in the interrogative
farm of the sentence:
(6B) kasikaha buare
aisiko hua
what
machete
with
Juan
(big knife)
(John)
n
—a
—e
—ra
kill PUNC PAST INTERROG
'What did John kill with the machete?'
S fronting and the reversing of the order of D ’s is commoun
in statements as well. In such cases, variations from the
basic order are conditioned by the discourse environment,
marking a diversity of functions including focus— this
time
highlighting. and providing new information rather
than
requesting it as in the case of interrogatives.
A FOCUS
FRONTING RULE may account for orders different from OSV in
statements. The operation of this rule is illustrated below:(69) a. atono

'
:
, It seems very likely that in OSV and DATIVE OSV sentences, a
;constraint against fronting more than one constituent in a
!|sentence' regulates the operativity of the FOCUSING RULE.
In
j (69V, it may be noticed that when S, or direct 0, is fronted,
tno movement of other constituents takes place. In my view, the
constrained J operativity of the FOCUS FRONTING RULE acts in
j favor of my hypothesis of OSV as the basic order in the
Jlanguage. ■ |
»
i Furthermore,,some obliques may appear post-verbally. This is
| particularly true of OSV and DATIVE OSV sentences with
I obliques, in which the latter may be thought to be more
•peripheral constituents.
It is my contention that the more
iperipheral a constituent of the Warao basic simplex sentence
J is, the freer its placement:

.(70-71) show that obliques may appear in several different
places within sentences. But obliques often precede or follow
other DSV sequences; at least this is true of sentences having
direct D ’s such as the ones in (70), as well as sentences
containing several obliques such as those in
(71).
(71c),
which is the only sentence within (71) not exhibiting ;GSV
order, reflects the operation of the FOCUS FRONTING RULE upon
the subject of the sentence; therefore,
(71c) has to| be
S-initial. It might be thought that the basic position of (the
more peripheral constituents within the Warao basic simplex
sentence is final, and that they are fronted by the FOCUS
FRONTING RULE in a way similar to that of moving subjects,
direct objects, etc. I find such possibilities inappropriate
since as (71c) shows, the FOCUS FRONTING RULE would have! to
front more than one sentential constituent at a time. I Have
painted out earlier in this analysis that there is ( a
constraint against a fronting movement of more than ,ane
constituent;
such a constraint favors my OSV word order
hypothesis and, clearly, my accepting of a multifranting
operation for the FOCUSING RULE would weaken it since I would
be using rules to explain free order rather than OSV order.
I
view the change in position of some obliques as motivated by a
kind of relationship that operate in discourse called staging
relationships. Grimes
(1975:113) paints out that ""staging
relationships are concerned with expressing the speaker's
perspective on what is being said"".
Additionally, Grimes
(1975:323) indicates that ""every clause, sentence, paragraph,
episode and discourse is organised around a particular element
that is taken as its point of departure. It is as though jthe
speaker presents what he wants to say from a particular
perspective.
I find it convenient to think in terms of how
various units are staged for the hearer's benefit"".
!'
To explain staging in Warao, focusing must be brought again
into discussion. I have already mentioned that new information
in Warao tends to appear in sentence initial position,

These speech acts and their verbalizations are free

A RIBU and ENOYABA A RIBU, person is determinant for ,the
occurrence of either one code or the other. If the encounter
of the interlocutors— or participants— in these speech acts
lasts enough as to consider that it fits into the categoryi of
a visit, the interplay of space, time and person contributes
to define a new different speech act called DEHEWARA A RIBU
'words of saying stories'. The latter often proceeds indoors,
once greeting has finished and participants have taken seats
an the floor, or in any available piece of furniture including
hammocks.
The act in most cases begins by questioning the
visitor as exemplified in (312) below
(312) kasikaha deh -ekira -ra
what
story no
INTERRQB
'What’s up? Any story?'
As a response, the one inquired might choose to narrate
any of his/her most recent experiences. This choice implies
the development of a speech act that may be considered a
sub-type within DEHEWARA A RIBU 'words of saying stories’. The
telling of stories about personal affairs already past or in
progress is known as ERIBU 'words of saying about common
events'. These stories may deal with topics as diverse as
family news, financial or health problems, communal routines
or travelling episodes. A fragment of a conversation on a

fundamental instruments to be used and invoked in shamanistic

rattle because stones are very uncommon in the territories120' o c c u p i e d by’the Warao. Rather,; this land has alluvial terrains

.deposited in the banks not the many mouths of its Delta.
Therefore, occasional stones or fragments of ancient rocks

Warao, as signalling magical, and sacred places considered
.habitats, of| spirits.,. Smalli, pieces of these stones in the hands
of a shaman means that he is in possession of the power and
^wisdom of the inhabiting1 spirits. The kareko 'pebbles of a

, The,; Warao currently live in the swampy areas next to the
hundreds of caSos through;, which the Orinoco river flows into
th e ,.Atlantic Ocean. This is an extensive triangulai— shaped
jdeltaic j.zone of about 22,’500 square kilometers where several
War ala ^settlements . may be found within relatively
short
'exploring journeys. As for present day papulation, the Warao
.consist of approximately 15,000 individuals. Mast of them are
bilingual in Warao and
Spanish
to varying degrees. Rather
few .!communities are dominantly monolingual in Warao.
Usually
these ’are the most remote 'and difficult to reach, located next
to the Guyanese border.
’i,
’
; .The : etymologyofthe term Warao is wa'canoe'andarao'people', that is, 'canoe people’. In a euphemistic sense,
""sailor at heart"" would be a suitable re-ferent far a Warao.
This is felt in the manner they address those who are not
Warao whom they call hotarao; hota high land"", arao ’people"",
i.e., 'high land people', or 'land lubbers’.
From a social-anthropological perspective, the Warao may be
considered as an ""aquatic"" fishing, hunting andd gathering
society.
SuSrez
(1971) provides ethnographical details of
relevance far this study. Borne aspects reported by SuSrez
(19715 deal with the Warao social and economic organization.
Any Warao settlement is composed of an extended family that
may have an average population of fifty individuals. Often a
household consists of a man, his wife and their unmarried
daughters and sons. The Warao practice matrilocal residence.
The traditional
economy
is
mainly based on palm tree
by-products,
though
this
system
is losing importance.
Recently, as a consequence of the permanent presence of
missionaries and the papulation of Spanish descent the Warao
have become corn and rice growers, undergoing a strong process
of acculturation. The co—existence of the traditional and new
economies has brought about the transformation of the Warao
from fishermen, hunters and gatherers to wage-earning laborers
still living in their primeval environment.
3. DATA BASE OF THE STUDY
Insofar as passible,
all data in the research are from
elicited material, though extended texts are used to fill in
certain
gaps
and
to
illustrate
simple,
completely
straight—forward forms. The field work sessions
extended
over an eighteen—month period
starting in
September 19B7
and concluding by May 19B9. Further data was collected in
August 1993. A corpus recorded on thirty six 90—minute tapes
was collected. It took
about
six
months
to transcribe
phanologicalIy those portions of the recorded
material
necessary for the research. The stage of data transcription
and analysis was completed early in 1990 and re-started for
new material in January 1995.
During the field work stage, with Lino palomo, a community
leader of Spanish descent from the State of Monsgas, I visited
thirteen Warao settlements along Cano Buha, including some
located in the Tigre, Winamorena and Wanakawaha islands. These
latter sites are all in Cano Manama— a major waterway that
marks the borderline between the states of Monagas and Delta
flmacura.
I chose San Jos6 de Buha, a small town about a
90-minute drive from Maturln, as the center of my operations
in the area. This was a strategic place given that San Jose de
Buha is a location midway between Maturin
(a major urban
center and state capital, where the Universidad de Oriente— my
employer
institution— has one of its campuses) and the Warao
motherland.
From San Jos# de Buha, 1 frequently travelled by2outboard boat to the informants' places. It must be mentioned
1 that I visited San Jos6 de Buha eleven times during the data
: collection stage, my longest stay being of fourteen days
[ during the Easter break of 1989.
>
•
; ;An important ‘esperiercE relates to my work in Winamorena, On
I this island,
I
visited a settlement where the orikaika
I oriwarao
'community made u p :of by an extended family'— the
i Warao primal manner of social
grouping— still survives.
I
; collected there a
variety
of
speech acts including
] stor-y—tel1ing about ancestors'as well as mythical characters.
I Also,. I recorded data about how the Warao conduct
collective
I discussion to solve
community
problems, advice
to reach
j settlements in the event of dispute and other specific social
; and linguistic performances. Finally, in Wanakawaha, I had the
f opportunity to be close to a place where a rite would be
| performed by the wi si ratu, a
religious
power—endowed
! personage, thatdirect the cult of the spirits.
I observed
I some of his actions, but I was unable to get recordings or
! even details of his gestures because I was not allowed inside
■ the;dwelling of the sick he was curing.
| Data collection around Cano.Buha and Cano Manama revitalized
j the information about the language revealed by my previous
material recorded in Hurupu, in the State of Sucre in 1979,
arid Yakariyene,
State of Delta fimaoira in 1933.
These two
places where I collected data in 1979 and 1983 are located
abotit 150 kilometers in a straight line from Buha, to the
north and southeast respectively. I
have
confirmed
my
hypothesis that there are not dialectal variants
of Warao,
though 1 rather think that there are some lexical differences
that d o .not cons:derably affect mutual intelligibility.
As for the use of extended texts, these are either from
Barral (1964) or from Vaquero (1965). Textual data from these
missionaries are primarily from the Central Orinoco Delta.
Mast of these texts comprise ancestral stories and myths,
although there are some conversational samples mainly
of a
procedural nature. In this research, examples taken from these
authors appear together with their bibliographical source.
4. METHODOLOGY FOR DATA COLLECTIONI
I followed the methodological procedures that search for
verbal acts in natural context (Labov, 1972),
one of the
principles of participant observation techniques
(Pelto &
Pelto,
1983). On no occasion was the data ellicited by using
interview schedules or written instruments of any sort.
In
this type of society, such instruments might bring about
inadequate responses causing in turn mistaken analysis due
mainly to the fact that the social norms and values of these
groups can only be understood by foreigners after very lengthy
periods spent, living in the community. In my case, I decided3that by the time
this
acquaintance with the Warao would
have become a reality, I would have learned whatever I was
interested in as far as my research
was
concerned withjhe
help of a guide. Thus, I preferred to integrate myself into
the community through a Warao that could take me to the right
informant in the right place at the right time. It should 'be
remembered that my stays in the Warao social contect did not
last bevand two consecutive weeks.
i
ftt the beginning, I tried to be as discreet as possible,
taking great care about what I said and did.
Soon,, I
internalize some elementary rules for group activities and the
Warao started to guide me through their social
life.
They
taught me internal aspects of their ways of living, and sjiep
by step, X could gradually discover some links between social
conduct and language usage. This was the stage of my field
work when the sociolinguistic framework I had set up a priori
for the dissertation began to operate smoothly.
Penetrating
into the Warao mind was not an easy task anyway, and I jam
still not certai-n that I was able to enter such unespected knd
unimaginable world. I mention this point because any time that
I turned on my tape recorder, even in situations in which, I
had learned such an action would be permissible, the faces (of
my interlocutors might equally reveal consent or disapproval,
often changing their attitude from one day to the next.j A
final remark on this point is that, in my own interpretation
of the facts, my data contain language quite similar to that
one that would have been spoken in my absence.
I cannot
discard the fact that some interference may have been brought
about by the tape recorder, and even by myself, since both jof
these elements were completely alien in the Warao daily
routines.

5. TRANSCRIPTION AND MORPHOPHONEMICSjThe following conventions are observed in presenting ! my
Warao examples. Three lines of information appear with most
examples
in the body of the paper:
ii)
a
morphemic
representation giving the underlying
forms
of
all
the
morphemes
and
the
boundaries between
them,
Cii) ' a
morpheme—by—morpheme English gloss, and (iii) an appropriate,
rather
free,
English translation.
In this
system , of
representation,
common recurring
morphemes
are
given
abbreviated glasses indicated in uppei— case letters. A list- of
these abbreviations is found in the introductory pages of this
research. It must be emphasized that the morpheme glosses are
intended for helping the reader to understand the structure or
usage, either in isolation or contextually.
It is worth
mentioning as well that when examples are intended for
presenting the referential content that characterizes some
styles, the morpheme-by-morpheme English glosses are avoided,
and an almost literal translation is included.

Quotative sentences such as those in <6) suggest that
order of
constituents
in some cample* sentences is
different from that in simplex sentences.
Sofar, basic OSV order for Warao has been6exemplifiedthe
not
ineach
of the major sentence types.
However,
structural
arrangements different from OSV are often found in the
language.
It is common in WaraD discourse to leave out P ’s
whose referents have been set' up earlier. Since the person of
the object of transitive verbs may be
marked in the verb,
transitive.. sentences occur frequently with the verb and the
subject; only. For example, (B) below
TRANSITIVE OSV
(B) ma

PUNC PASTOn the other hand, copulative sentences in Warao nearly
always
are
subject
initial,
showing
mostly
S—COMP(lement)—CPF' (ula) order. Further, ha —kitane ‘BE/HAVE
— INFINIT.’, the form denoting ‘COP’ may be deleted giving rise
to S-CQMP order. The examples below illustrate the case:
COPULATIVE S-COMP-COP
<1Q) a. tai tira burebaka ha
i
that;woman insane
COP
’That woman is insane’1COPULATIVE S-COMP
b. tai tira burebaka O
that woman insane
’That woman (is) insane’Different from 0 and COP which, as shown, may not explicitly
appear in the Warao sentence, B tends to be expressed. This is
so ;because the WaraD verb is unmarked for subject agreement;
hence, subjects need to be present to avoid ambiguities and
misunderstandings. A subjectless sentence such as (lib) below
is exclusively motivated by the discourse environment:
(lib)
ohviously reflects a short answer to a question:
(11) a. Q: ihi
ma
kaika nao —nak.a
2sg.S lsg.O with come NEG
’Don’t you come with me?’
b. A: 0nao —naka

INTERROB1The process illustrated by til) above involves a principle
of economy of words which operates in languages wherever the
logic of conversational sequences allows no possible confusion
1
From the review of (1-10), the facts of imnportance about
Warao word order are: ti > V is final, (ii) S nearly always
immediately precedes V, and (iii) D mostly occurs in sentence
initial position. Ahead in this Section, the rules that permit
variations from the basic QSV order

not, attract other constituents, such as objects,
complements and adjuncts.

!(12a) exhibits the complex noun phrase araotuma tama hobahi
'The inhabitants of this land’ which contrast in length with
the proper noun wauta 'Wauta' seen in (12b), both filling in
subject slots.
i
Subjects in Warao lack morphological devices that allow
their identification; for instance, they are not case-marked.
This feature coupled with the fact that Waran is a verb final
language in which the remaining sentence constituents
(both
subject and objects)
usually precede, make subjects very
resistant to deletion. It
might
be expected that overt
subjects contribute to preserve meaning.
Subjects normally
express the agent
of
the action, if there is one. This8j t-,i- . ,i . y;ir.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

there is one or several story—teller(s) addressing a group or
'auditorium. ,<317—319) represent an unidirectional system.

telling 'of 'ancestral tales involves

formality, ’ or iat least, a semi—formal treatment.

considered about the unidirectional situation relates to the
behavior o f ; the listeners which is almost totally passive,
remaining in silence all over the delivering. In this case,
listeners' - participations— “if

confine
themselves to collective laughing as a response to stimuli of
comic nature;
!

121Another speech act that has been detected— called
DIHIBU 'words of giving explanations'— covers discussions
intended for solving communal problems, particularly those
which have caused physical and verbal violence or any other
kind of disagreement among the Warao of a village. !The
contextual situation for DIHIBU is somewhat defined by ithe
time, space, person and referential content parameters, i A
DIHIBU session meets at night in the place of any community
leader, whether this is the home of the kobenahoro 'governor',
or
any airamp 'chief'— the bisi kari
'fiscal',
kabitano
'captain'
or borisia 'policeman'. The confronting parties
together with relatives and friends show up at the meeting
place where the kobenahoro and other chiefs might have
convened, and one by one expresses points of view about the
matter. They may be questioned to clarify doubts.
Once
argumentations
have been evaluated,
one of the
chiefs
interprets what has happened and makes a point on what the
consequences of such deeds may be or might have been. Finally,
he encourages the ceasing of hostilities and the restoration
of harmony between the upset men, groups or families. ;The
chief emphasizes in the need of sticking to peaceful solutions
such as the ancestors always did. The chiefs’ pieces of advice
seldom generate reactions other than those leading to a
settlement;
nonetheless, the participants in DIHIBU meetings
may go on in the discussion of the problem for several hours
to adjust the terms of the arrangement. My data suggests that
consensus is obtained very quickly when the chief is a
skillful orator.
In egalitarian societies like the Warao,
leading statuses correlate with ability to preserve good
interpersonal
relations in groups and communities.
The
opposite condition— current alteration of social order :and
delay to bring it back— means leadership weakening, and often
this triggers the renewal of community heads.

TABLE 23: Language and style according to Urban (1987)
According to Urban C19875, the small boxes in the diagram
represent distict styles. Each of these styles may involve a
distinctive distributional structure. Some aspects or parts of
a structure may be shared between different styles.
These
shared aspects of structure are indicated by Urban using
larger boxes— labelled PART 1, PART 2, etc.— that encompass
more than one style. Thus, Urban (1987) notes, lexical
items
may be found in certain styles but not in others, a particular
morphological rule may characterize only some styles, a
specific syntactic phenomenon may be relatively localized, and
so on.
Urban
(1987) groups the basic parameter of
variation^ variation South America under the general
of SPACE, TIME, PERSON and REFERENTIAL CONTENT.(
)
istylistic
headings(i)
SPACE. With regard to the spatial parameters of style,
linguistic
work
draws close
to
social
anthropology.
Anthropologists working on South America have drawn attention
to the notion of ""social space"", that is SPACE conceived as
relevant to society. Brahaoi (1986) studied the usage of three
styles;
ritual wailing, communal singing and
political
oratory.
She observed that the styles tends to be associated
exclusively with distinct parts of the Xavante social space.
Xavante villages are organized into a semicircle of houses
around a central plaza. Graham
(1986) noted that ritual
wailing occurred almost exclusively around the hut, whereas
political oratory was associated with the plaza, the area
where the meetings of the men's council occurred. Communal
singing was in this regard intermediate, taking place in the
plaza, but also between the plaza and the hut as groups of men
marched around the village singing.!

i.i,(ii)
TIME. Time is a very -frequent co—determinant of usage.
One example of this is discussed by Urban (1987) along the
following lines: in Shakleng, the origin of myth-telling, dr
ceremonial dialogue style, known as the waneklen. and the ■
dyadic chanting style known as the ahan are closely related in
structure-independent
forms,
differing
markedly;
in
structure—dependent aspects. The former style is associated i>
with these rituals for the dead, and it is in this measure
temporally—bound. The latter style occurs at the lip—plug
giving and thigh—tabooing ceremony for 1— to 3—year— old
children.
It only takes place in the latter temporallyj-bound ,
context.
(iii)
PERSON.
A basic distinction, Urban
(1987) notices,
among personal determinants of style has to do with their
relational as opposed to non-relational character. The ! style
may be determined more in terms of the person who is speaking,
regardless of the interlocutor or other aspects of the
context, or mare in terms of the relationship
between
speaker(s)
and
hearer(s).
Among
the
non-relational
determinants are such basic oppositions as that between,; male
and female.
In some cases, there may be full of structural
differences
between men's and women's
speech.
Another
non-relational contrasts involves age, especially, differences
between elder and younger speech.
j
A relational determinant is style variation depending
upon the kinship relation between speaker and hearer. In; some
Central Brazil
languages, affinal relationships demand a E
formality in interaction which includes linguistic styles.
i.
i
(iv)
RFERENTIAL CONTENT. This refers to the content or
subject matter of the discourse which may be associated with ,
stylistic distinctiveness.
In general, style determined by
content is usually referred to as ""genre"". Urban (19B7) i notes
that there are many formal features that
differentiate |‘
myth-telling from other instances of language use, and that j
differentiate one type of myth—tel1ing, that dealing' with
traditional stories, from another, that dealing with the
origin myth. In the case of Shakleng, Urban paints out, , these iare mainly lexical and syntactic; however, in other Amazonian |.
languages they may be basically phonological.

30. WARAQ SPEECH ACTS AND ASSOCIATED DISCOUSE FEATURES
To accomplish the goal of describing different speech !styles
which characterize by particular morpho—syntactic and lexical
usages determined— on a spatial—temporal framework— by the ■
person who is speaking, kinship ties or social relationships o
between speakers and hearers and referential contents or |(
subject matters into consideration, it is necessary to (typify
speech acts and clasify the discourse features prevailing in
such types. Only after this step has been completed, styles or ;

The: speech act quoted above, called BAHUKA A RIBU
'words of saying to be good' or 'words of greeting', may vary
according
to circumstances' such as kinship, degree
of
intimacy, frequency of meeting, purpose of the encounter if it
is .intentional, and others. Jhis particular speech act tends
to be rather formal particularly because among the Warao,
personal relations are plentiful of respect and consideration
for. the elderly and for the masculine members of the nuclear
and extended families. Ttius,' this greeting formula is almost
compulsory;
It is quite likely that individuals who are
closely: acquainted will use jargon of over sexually—oriented
content
in
their greeting.
These
interlocutors
will
incorporate such sexual remarks into BAHUKA A RIBU bringing
about 'a different type of speech act known as ENOYABA A RIBU
’words : of.making fun'. The resultant speech act, an informal
variant. of BAHUKA A RIBU,; often involves two males, or
females, of similar age, usually youngsters, that may belong
to '■the same family or to different ones. The discoursive

exception falls on the second syllable from the end in
disyllables, trisllables and polysyllables.
Monosyllables
generally bear heavy stress if the syllable pattern in CV, and
weak stress if the syllable patern is V (Romero Figueroa,
1986b).
In
some cases,
monosyllables
are
completely
unstressed. Further, heavy stress in Warao often shifts to the
right in search for penultimate syllables once roots take
inflections.
This displacement obviouslyoccurs
across
morphemic boundaries.
fin example of Warao stress shift is
provided in (309)
(309) nahbro
nShord -te'You eat'nahiro —nAka'You do not eat'nahorb -nak& -ra'Don’t you eat?’The marking of weak stress in (309) agrees with a rule by
which alternate syllables are stressed with weak secondary
stress, counting back from the heavily stressed syllable, and
syllables not stressed with heavy stress are unstressed;
In Warao, no two words are distinguished by placement of
stress.
Stress has a purely delimitative function in the
language. Root boundaris may be set departing from the
syllables
bearing
heavy stress which will
always
be
penultimate, alterning with unstressed and weak syllables
either to the right or to the left. This behavior implies that
the next heavily-stressed syllables necessarily belong to
other roots. Root boundary setting also demand an analysis of
allophone
distribution, specially that of those
solely
appearing word-initially.

29. SOCIOLINBUISTIC CONSIDERATIONS
Speech in sociolinguistics streches along a wide range from
formal to casual, accomodating in between a number
of112w
Mintermediate possibilities linked at different degrees to two
such poles.;, There is a tendency to choose pieces of casual
*speech. to look into usages of language in environments in
iwhich, the ;..presence of an alien— the researcher
is felt as
-undisturbing. OnceT.casual speech and social context have been
correlated
and results of; that correlation
have
been
understood, the remaining varieties up to the most formal one
.can be grasped. This approach strongly favors sociolinguistic
studies,
concerning societies different from those
most
!linguists belong to, and languages quite distinct from the
one, or ones they speak. This is so because we would be unable
to =comprehend language performances if the social
setting
where they occur is unknown to us. Of course, the linguistic
interpretation ; of any language is successful when
the
.researcher is perceived by natives as a part of the group and
they start to act as if the linguist were not present.*i
‘r 1n
iTo obtain casual speech in context implies the sharing of
experiences
with
the
social group
or
groups under
•
‘investigation.
This also means an extensive involvement with
the; members of the group(s). A fundamental achievement in
sociolinguistic researches the obtaining of speech in which
experiences and involvement conflate.
In
most societies, perhaps all, contexts of
speech
interaction
set up such dimensions
as
sacred—secular,
serious—trivial, open network-closed network,
and several
other value scales CBrown & Fraser, 1979), which ultimately
lead to the use of particular styles. Speech styles vary with
^participants in diverse manners. According to Brown S< Fraser
(1979), we may distinguish between speech styles as markers of
various characeristies of the individual speakers and speech
styles as markers of relationships among participants. What is
mast distinctive about many of these styles is the nature of
-the. lexicon.
Brown 5* Fraser.(1979)
mention that doctors,
stockbrokers and gamblers,use different words while performing
their respective roles. Since the topics of their talk are
quite different this is harly surprising, and if all, what was
claimed was that different activities require
different
vocabularies.
But of course, even as far as vocabulary is
-concerned, there is more to it than that.
For professional
-groups are likely to be using technical terms for activities
which would be discussed in different terms by layman.
Styles can also contain phonological markers.
In this
respect,
Brown
& Fraser
(1979)
indicate
that
radio
commentators,
for instance, make use of extra stress for
loudness contrasts, and use intonation both to
connect
segments into lengthy, apparently coherent, sentences, and
also to give clear indications of finality.
This kind of
phonological features that may be associated to particular
styles are widely spread over languages of the world.","[118, 119, 120]"

-features. Thus, I must provide some details
about;,; the religious beliefs and order-preserving mechanisms
among,the War'ao which are necessary -for the understanding of
some! of^the findings. Although I shared with the Warao enough
time) -for drawing my own conclusions, -further information in
this; dissertation has been- taken from Barral (1964) and Su&rez
''(1;97:1K ij;
;
i,i:= \.T, ■
;
;
:
With regard to religious life, Suarez (1971) paints out
that the. control of0 the supernatural forces lies in the hands
of the wisiratu ' (lit.) the owner of the poison'— a medicine
practitipner that has the power to nullify evilness inflected
by someone else, the hoarotm ' (lit. the owner of the evil
spirits'(-one ‘that has the power to inflict evilness to someone
else! an(
d the bahanarotu '(lit.) the owner of the magical
arrow';. Respectively, these Warao religious guides master
three supernatural forces which enter the human body and cause
three sorts of Very different diseases, namely hebu 'a spirit
bf ""h’at:ure~ . hoa ’an evil spirit’ and hatabu 'an enchantment'.
Suirez 1(1971) adds that'1 eafch one of these diseases has
specific- symptoms and theLtherapy carried out varies in each
instance.
An individual ill with hebu suffers from digestive
disorders, fever and flu. The wisiratu's cure consists of
•invocations' to helping spirits'— by using his mar aka 'a rattle'
tagethen with tobacco smoke blowing and massages— to evict the
u.ntiealth(
y possession from the victim’s body.
According to
Suarez) interpretation of the facts, hebu can be identified as
spirits ""of trees, rain, water,, shadows, etc. The wisiratu is a
person who himself possesses hebu. anattribute obtained
from
the ;1time of
his initiation,' and that it is the
one that
enables him'to control its'rdiverse detrimental manifestations.
The wisiratu also protects his community of the dangers of
natural phenomema. I never;had- the chances to witness a curing
ritual, j but ,1 indeed watched a wisiratu sending away a storm

In contrast, hoa is an oral witchcraft sent by the
hoarotu“1 like an arrow against; someone chosen as his prey. A
Warao attacked - by hoa feels; terrible pains elsewhere and
tecoghizes himself to have been a victim of a wicked hoarotu125living in the same settlement or in its sorroundings. hoa. also
designates an oral formula used by the hoarotu for curing hoa
disease.
Hence, the hoarotu performs both actions: he can
cause illness and he is also able to restore health by tobacco
smoke blowing and massages. I could never record a jhoa;
however, Barral
(1945: 170) reports one of them such as is
shown in (321) below
!

'‘Scorpion, scorpion, owner of the poison

(approKimate translation of my own)
hatabu is produced by the bahanarotu. Like hoa. hatabu is
also an arrow directed against a victim;
however, hatabu
differs from hoa in that it is invested with a corporal
appearance
(Suarez,
1971:62).
hatabu has a materialistic
configuration in the farm of strings, fish-hooks, hair, etc.,
which have a pathogenic action ascribed to them. The treatment
of hatabu consists of suction, tobacco smoke blowing and
massages intended to extract the arrow embedded in the sick
Warao.
Although I never attended a bahanarotu act;
I have
chosen to exemplify a piece of discourse of this type by
quoting Olson (1973) in (322) below1261322) ;ine yemawarine ine
ine hiahoko anaware yehebatu
ine etuMaratu ine
'ine sabaaabama
taimonuka ine

'I am the master '
,1 am the caller of; the, hebu
I am your greater
£ am the same as him
, ;my beginning is together with him
this is my name....
{Olsen, 1973:57)
hoa and hatabu are the most fatal causes of death.
When
I'.lie hoarotu and the bahanarotu are unable to extract them and
fail ifi their curative functions then the patient inevitably
dies, hebu is a less serious health problem being milder than
the others. .
i
. i Suarez
<1971) proposes that the basic belief in the
.Warao theory of disease causation is that the human body is
'attacked by the incorporation of supernatural forces which are
conceptualized in three different ways: hebu as a natural
spirit which possesses the individual and hoa and hatabu as
two maleficent arrows which enter the body of a victim.
The
'former is abstract, the latter is concrete. Both are produced
by practitioners who assumms dual roles: one aggressive and
harmful;
the other beneficient and curative.
Warao society
makes the malevolent aspect of the hoarotu and the bahanarotu
dominant,
and the wickedness of both is socially recognized
.and inspires fear, whereas the wisiratu. master of hebu, is
;well known for his goodness and benevolence.
Coming into political organization, the Warao society
is egalitarian,
although social order is controlled
by
individuals who exercise leadership on the grounds of their
•mastery of supernatural and natural farces as well as their
control of oratory and their language proficiency.
Any Warao,
as he grows older and his success in salving community
problems has been tested in practical situations, would have
access to 1eadership.in his family group and by extension to
his neighbors and even his settlement as a whole.
Thus, as
Suirez
(1971) notes, two sorts of jural statuses can be
distinguished:
one for the kobenahoro 'governor’, kabitano
'captain', bisikari 'fiscal' and borisia 'policeman', who are
the leaders; the other belonging to the nebu 'young men' or
'workers’.
The
former set groups
under
the
generic
denomination airamotuma 'chiefs'. They are usually the oldest
men in the village. Within the airamotuma 'chiefs', the
kobenahoro takes the supremacy on the grounds of extensive
accumulated experience over the longest time period
as
compared with the others. The remainder-- kabitano. bisikari
and
borisia— become
the
kobenahoro *s
assistants.
The127kobenahpro ' 5 assistants are younger people and are related to
him by kinship ties in most cases. The need o-f assistants- willstraight— forwardly depend upon the size of the communities and
even their distribution in the area. Biven that the terms
kobenahoro.
kabitano.
bisikari and borisia are
Ularao
adaptations of Spanish 'gobernador’, ’capitan’, 'fiscal'I and
'policia', it is likely that the original system— prior to the
presence
fo Spanish-descent
settlers
in
the
Warao
homeland— were simply called airamotuma 'chiefs', under; the
supreme leadership of a nobo 'grandfather' of widely-accepted
respectability. At least, the DENQBQ A R1BU 'words of telling
stories about ancestry’ does not report instances of any of
the Spanish-based terms. Rather, such stories often report
ancestral
gran-fathers’ physical dexterities
and
mental
capabi1ities.

32. RELEVANT WARAO LINGUISTIC PATTERNS IN SOCIAL CONTEXT
An important linguistic aspect linked to religious, and
political leaders is in passing viewed by Wilbert (1975) when
analyzing a Warao folktale. Wilbert (1975) notices that | ""the
use of metaphoric language among the Warao is largely related
to the social and religious elite of the tribe.
They either
choose archaic words, no longer in common use, or modify* the
current lexicon ""by adding,
suppressing or
substituting
letters, syllables and even words with or without semantic
meaning"" (Barral, 195B:30). Independently from his use of -such
terms as tribe and elite which are incompatible with the Warao
organizational
and
social systems
(Warao
society)
is
egalitarian), Wilbert
(1975) offers adequate observations
about language use. He points out that ""on special occasions
priest—shamans, in trance or not, chant texts that are totally
unintelligible...and chiefs are prone to use connotative
language when each morning before sunrise they chant their
work orders."" Barral (1945:157) also provides information of
linguistic value as follows: The hoarotu when chanting his hoa
artificially modulates his voice in rythmic and varied tones;
intensifying and diminishing volume, always keeping a ipace
with his sacred rattle, wisthing like birds, buzzing) and
chirping like insects, hissing like snakes and s d forth, j
Language codes, or styles, of the kind reported by
Barral
(1945) may of course be distinguished apart frbm a
knowledge of structure.
In such cases, in the absence of
previous contact with Warao, any hearer can nevertheless
detect that a particular style of language is in use, because
it will develop in a specific phonological framework.
These
code variants are in some measure structure-independent;
therefore, they fall outside the scope of this work. In accord
with the theoretical background on style offered in (Bee 30.),
distinctive intonation, metering and voice quality say l,ittle
about language structure. I will exclusively focus on lexical
factors such as the ones mentioned by Wilbert (1975)
inj the
preceding, as well as ir. morpho—syntactic patterns operating
in association, with certain styles that I have identified in1.I

participation from duads to meetings. BAHUKA A RIBU on the one

{participant's performing ""one 'at a time, or even at the same

They’ ''both alternate their 'passages of talk in a dialagistic

!ilid1M,duals; of analogous statuses, from workers to chiefs. On
ithe'ii grounds-of such statuses and their associated discourse
icdntdntd is1that distinctions have been possible to be set up,
;for !‘ instance, between 8AHUKA A RIBU ’words of expressing
wel lr-beijng ’ and ENOYABA A RIBU ’words of making fun’, as well
as ..between .the two speech acts above mentioned and ERIBU
■’words rif talking about common; events ’, and within this latter
type', between NQBARA A RIBU ’.words of telling stories about

two participants in action'.

a
speech act in which

etc. Conversely, nebu 'workers' are not allowed to *
upset participating order and they never interrupt when
someone else is talking.
33.3. Only an individual, addressing an audience
This is in most cases a situation observed in DENOBQ A 1
RIBU ’words of telling stories about ancestry-. The leading
participant narrates a story about which he must show total
mastery because any slip of memory would trigger complaints 1
and inattention. As well, the leading participant without any >■
interruptions must take to its end the story that he has begun
to tell as an evidence of his abilities.
Any one in the
audience is allowed to comment about one or more aspects of !
the story, or may correct the story-teller if a deviation of ,
the actual facts is noticed. In those cases in which the story
is delivered uneventfully the audience usually remains silent
and attentive.
!
34. WARAO SPEECH STYLES
All of the data on Warao speech acts and participant *
roles in discourse offered in the preceding sections hasi
enabled me to isolate some speech styles in the language.
Although the kind of style I have centered my attention on is
the structure-depfendent one, it is very likely that in such,
isolated styles morpho-syntactic and phonological features
intersect.
For
instance,
DIHIBU
'words
of
giving
explanations',
a speech act which often includes several
participants performing one at a time or even several at the
same time, the end of the part of each interlocutor is marked
by an acute tone concomitant with vowel lengthening. This is a
systematic procedure that may be thought to be a resource to
preserve ordering in participations on the part of individuals
of similar statuses by making the audience— by using sound
effects— aware
of
the end of
everyone's
talk.
This
phonological device is observed even in variants of sentential
arrangements that are often found in DIHIBU. I have chosen in
these cases to make considerations about the morpho—syntactic
aspects
only,
disregarding
sound
patterning
and
suprasegmentals.
Given
its peculiarities, DIHIBU ’words of
giving
explanations'
as a speech act sets down a specific style.
I
have called it the DERI STYLE 'council style'. The passages of
talk in the DERI STYLE offer very interesting saciolinguistic
data for the three following reasons: (i3 participants focus
on just one topic in most of the cases offering explanations
of actions that depict a problem and identify individuals
playing parts in it. This sort of explanations contain varied130phonological, morphosyntactic , and lexical forms that make
possible to compare manners of saying and behaving. The DERI
STYLE! closely associates with direct speech, the manner of
speech nowadays ; considered the keystone for understanding
dxscoursive sequences and their socio-cultural
meaning and
inip1ications, Cii) language is used not only for transmitting
; expressions and discussing actions, but it itself represents
actions
since
every
participant— using
all
possible
, resources— attempts to convince the others of accepting his
point .of view., One of the major efforts in this respect should
be .made by the airamotuma 'chiefs' whose fundamental role is
the -finding; of a solution' to each problem,
for instance,
persuading the protagonists of an impasse to change the
attitude of one towards the other and viceversa.
In this
sense, - the DERI STYLE is a source of data for studying
performativity’ (Brimes,
1975), and
(iii) contents reveal
linguistic
usages
that allows to explore degrees
of
proficiency and personal attitudes of the Warao towards the
Warao language. The passages of talk in the DERI STYLE offered
by participants, independently from statuses, point out the
.relevance, of such conceptual relations as those shown in
(323> belriw
(36) obonobo ===> dibu ===> yanoko ===> yakerata
think
say
listen
solve
(Briggs, 198B)
'
Several notes of morpho—syntactic value about Warao by
Barr si
(195B) have been included in ethnographies, grammars
and dictionaries in the absence of an analysis of styles in
this language. As a result, some of the remarks by Barra! lack
justifications,
and in the case of other
authors their
appreciations are not convincent. For instance, Barral
(195B)
mentions
that ""occultism""— or what he personally
calls
""literary camouflage""— is an outstanding quality of the speech
of the airamotuma 'chiefs' and wisiratu 'shamans'. Barral adds
that the airamotuma and wisiratu try to create a sort of
mysterious environment around them to reach the goal to put
intentionally a belief into any Warao's mind, and since the
Warao are candid, as he says, the use of language showing
uncommon
arrangements
and
realisations
of
difficult
interpretation becomes an instrument f a r
such a purpose.
Socially,
Barral's judgement may be true, but from
a
linguistic perspective, his explanation is insufficient.
I
have found that what seems to be simply ""literary camouflage""
represents indeed manifestations of stylistically-motivated
syntactic
patterns and lexicon.
For instance,
suffixal
pronouns, and morphological causatives of di—transitive verbs
are typical in the DERI STYLE, and some of these structures
are variants of other structures commonly used in everyday
language. It appears to be that the emphatic value of suffixal
pronouns as opposed to the semantic effect of prefixal ones
arid
the
possibilities
of
language
enrichment
that
morphological di—transitive causatives bring about as compared
with other causatives are important tools in discoursive
131sequences related to DIHIBU.
DENOBO A RIBU ‘words of telling stories about ancestry’ , a
speech act in which only one of the participants addresses an
audience, is a propitious content for the use of another; style
in Warao. I have called it the DENOBO STYLE 'legend style’.
The DENOBO STYLE characterizes by the use of certain lexical
items of deictic value that make passible to place events in
specific
time frameworks.
Such
temporal
units— -mainly
periphrasitic past adverbs— are seldom heard in everyday
language, and their use seems to be a prerrogative of those
who are in charge of the oral transferring of Warao traditions
from generation to generation, namely airamotuma 'chiefs' and
nobotuma 'grandfathers’. For instance, the use of vama 'BY
HSY', atehewitu 'at the very beginning', and so forth,
contribute— in addition to referential contents— to set up a
distinction between DENQBO A RIBU 'words of telling stories
about ancestrys'
and ERIBU 'words of talking about common
events'. The latter, as opposed to the former, mostly includes
deictic adverbs and postositional locatives, which obviously
lack the connotative remoteness of such time expressions as
'BY HSY (as my elders told long time ago)' or 'at the very
beginning', and others.
To sum up, styles in Warao correlate with speech

(1) The data provided by Marao and the descriptive analysis
here offered is expected to have broadened the data base
available to linguistic science for purposes of formulating
substantive
and
formal universale an
human
language,
particularly in areas of current theoretical interest s u c h ; as
the determination of basic constituent order, Waran has proven
to be a predominantly object initial language within a very
steady verb final sentential
pattern, which favors
iOSV
arrangement in simplex sentences. Although subjects in Warao
appear
to be erratic constituents often,
fronted
for
highlighting purposes, they may be adjacent to verbs, behavior
which works in support of its classification as a prototypical
CSV language.
(2) Warao has evidenced that styles are not separable ! or
differentiable solely on the basis of structural or other
linguistic dissimilarities. Although, X have demonstrated ‘the
existence of a style— the DERI
'council'
STYLE— which is
structural 1-/-dependent, I would have not been able to isolate
it in the absence of ""specific meaning determined by ;the
contextual situation"".
Indeed, in Warao, there are styles
which are very much alike from a syntactic point Df view, and
they differentiate just because they have an inherent social
significance.
Thus, any researcher interested in style must
endeavour to discover such specific meanings by penetrating
the social setting so as to be able to conceive SPEECH ACTS
and PARTICIPANT ROLES. In some cases, the decisive factors in
defining styles which are very much alike in their syntax is
the content of the speaker's discourse.
In some
other
instances it is the purpose of his/her verbal performance, and
even in other instances it is the kind of audience they have.
(3) This sociolinguistic sketch of Warao incorporates this
language to the very reduced set of Amazonian languages that
have been looked into upon an adequate theoretical framework.
Many existing analyses written at the turn of the century have
described native languages against a Latin-based grammatical
background.
Despite
increased contributions
about
the
functioning of native languages developed during the past
twenty
years, the Amazon—Orinoco axis still remains
a
linguistic
reservoir about which very little has
been
investigated.
In this particular linguistic context, some
studies of strict phonological, morpho-syntactic and lexical
scope have been completed. Nevertheless, little attention has
been paid to language and society interaction.
Native South
American languages very often offer different patterns and
alternative
forms rooted in societal traits.
In
these
languages, perhaps more than in any others, the property of
variation in languages becomes remarkably significant. I have
found for Warao oral performances that the diverse forms of
stylistic differentiation are intimately linked to social
organization— interacting actively and each one supporting the
134styi isti c
other.
In
the
Waraa case, the
study
of

j12.3. Complex sentence negation
For complex coordinate sentences which relate two (or more)
finite
(or tensed) clauses paratactically, negation operates
such as in simplex sentences: —naka 'NEB' is suffixed to the
verb of one or the other clause, or both, depending on whether
conjointness
(or disjointness), or adverseness is involved.
Such an addition of the negation marker to verbs triggers :the
regular tense and aspect inflection movements linked to the
presence of the auxiliary ta 'AUX' elsewhere.
On the other hand, although Warao employs little embedding,
the
data
reveals
that
the
means
for
negating
hypotactically—related clauses are not different from those
observed
in
simplex
sentences,
and
complex
paratactically-related ones.
Embedding
in
Warao implies one
clause
holding
a
hypatactical relation with another, whose linkage may be
indicated either by an inflectional morpheme in association
with aspect/mood, or by an independent word
(a sort of
complementizer), or by nothing. The possibilities of combining
negative and non-negative main and embedded clauses, no matter
the kind of linkage between them, are:
(i) negative main
clause/non-negative embedded clause, (ii) non—negative main
clause/negative embedded clause, and
(iii) negative main
clause/negative embedded clause.
In the types in
(i) and
(iii), negation has a broad scope covering the
entire
sentence. Within this context, negation, morpho-syntactically
speaking, operates just as it does within the simplex sentence
context.
Examples of the combinations in (i) and
(iii) are

restricted only to the embedded portion of the whole sentence,

I25.3. Comitative
Comitative is expressed by means of the postposition kaika
'in the companion o f ’ or 'with someone’. This postposition
conveys
the comitative sense by indicating someone : in
association with which some entity was or is, or was or is
during the enactment of a situation. In the fallowing example,
the noun phrase in constituency with kai ka 'with someone'
represents someone the actor was in association with while
enacting the situation:
(23B) atono
kaika oka naru -ki —tia
Antonio
with we go
INT HAB
(Anthony)
'We are going with Anthony as usual'
As well, the presence of kai ka 'with someone' may imply,that
the entity which it introduces is typically of higher status
than the one representing the partner, as in (239)

the25.4. PossessionBesides the possession markers of the language that may be
prefixed to any noun CSee 19.1.3, Warao has two postpositio­
nal mechanisms to express possession: (i) by means of the
genitive postposition a 'of' following the possessor within a
possessor—possessed N P . and (ii) by means of the genitive
postposition abitu 'of' following any noun.","[96, 97]"
"1 ' ■: ■Disjunction conveys the idea of exclusion. In Waraa, the
logics of discourse is the only
resource to be used for
determining which clause content excludes the other one.
Disjunction
seems not to be
well integrated
in
the
interclausal
relations
of
the
language.
Warao—Spanish
bilingual speakers who know the use of
the
Spanish
disjunctive: coordinates frequently express doubts about the
appropriatness of examples when asked to

them. They
sometimes frame their disjunctive coordinates upon the Spanish
framework incorporating o ’o r ’ to their native utterance.

construction consisting necessarily ot a head noun and a ‘rc
which restricts such a head noun by giving a proposition that

(Comrie,
1981:136),
In
agreement
with
Camrie’s
characterization, Keenan (1935:141) points ou that RC's are
tull noun phrases consisting at a determiner, a common noun
and an rc. Keenan adds that semantically the common noun
(henceforth N) determines a class of objects, called the
domain of relativization and the rc identifies the sub—set of
the domain, those elements which satisfy the condition given
by the RC. In Waraa R C ’s, the domain N occurs within the rc,
which makes them internal (as opposed far instance to English,
in which the domain N occurs outside the rc):

'You all, come to see the bird that flies at night'
In (32), the rc imaya narite kotai 'that flies at night'
is
split
by domu 'bird', the domain N. Thus, the RC iroaya domu
narite kotai 'the bird that flies at night' is clearly of
the
internal class.
In Waraa, subject and abject nouns may : be
relativized. The relativizer item is kotai 'REL'.","[48, 49]"

importance about the Warao comparatives are: (i) the language
uses analytical comparison'exclusively, and (ii) it lacks an
element that 'may be considered to have the status of a
""complementizer"".
Related to '(ii), in the absence of a
;""d:ompiemehtiZer""-like element,ino alternative mechanism such
as case—marking of the standard Iof comparison is used.
It j(is .clear from (26) that the language has asymmetrical
comparison of inequality,
(A>B, and A<B). klarao also has
comparison
of equality,
(A-B). The data, by
means
of
arrangements .such as the-: one in
(26d) demonstrates the
possibility 'of asymmetrical equality.
However, the
data
indicates!that symmetrical equality (AB=) (similar to English
’same/equal/like/alike') is prevalent in the language.
The
strongest! indicator of symmetrical equality is the kind of
relationship ti holding between the topic of comparison and the
standard of comparison in casesIsuch as (29), far example:
(29) tama —ha , raisa monuka ha
: this iNOM other same
i COP
) 'The other! and this one are the same', or
> 'This and the other are the same'Y t Ina (29), t t h e topic of'comparison and the standard of
comparison
keep a figure/figure relation rather than a
figure/background one.
.}. ,
.<(
.Also,, from
(26—29), it might be said that in Uarao,
comparison is expressed by postposing to atributive nouns some
•!.quantity jdeterminers, such as Ikuarika 'more' and sabuka or
- valioto 'iess'
in the c a s e ’of inequality, and the adverb of

other languages be distinguished as adverbs,

also locative and time expressions. Adverbs are bound together
into one class on the grounds of their common function as

However, not all word—initial consonants are
voiced and there are differences in the frequency of voiceless
allophones.
For example, Cb3Cp3 may be said to be almost in
free variation i n most word positions. It is common to hear
Cpotapotdl ar Cbotobotal. But, Cb3 will tend to appear in
Spanish loans, whether they contain /p/ or /b/ stops, for
instance, Spanish pelota 'ball* borrows as Warao berota.
cambiar ’change' as kabiata and barco 'ship' as baroko. Among
the speakers of the area under research for this dissertation,
initial
Cp3 is found in a very reduced set of lexical
items,
for example,
[payaral 'kind of fish' which never was heard
with the voiced stop. In Warao, Cp3 and Cb3 are unaspirated as
all remaining stops,
On the other hand, the J r / allophones Cd3Cr3 occur in quite
specific phonological environments: (i) Cd3 always appears
initially, and (ii) Cr3 is always intervocalic. In Warao,
the
Cr3 variant has the highest frequency of occurrence given the
fact that to the extensive native lexicon containing such
allaphonic realization, Spanish loans including initial or
medial /r//l/ and /d/, medial J r / and medial clusters such as
/dr/ must also be incorporated. Some examples are presented in

"26.1.2.1.2. Non-past tenseThe non-past marker -te ’NON—PAST’ is used with reference to
present (currency) and future (subsequency) without any formal
distinction between them. Also, -te ’NON-PAST’ is inherently
imperfective, which is inferred from its possible association
with the imperfective punctuality aspect marker -a 'PUNC'. The
non-past tense marker is incompatible with the completive
(inherently perfective) aspect marker of the language:95tI(25B) hirahe

To account for Warao verb tenses, a major splitting
PAST a n d !NON-PAST suffices.between■ The term PAST is obvious enough since it means ""anterior to
the
moment : of
speaking"",
or ""looked
back
on"",
or
""recollected”, or ""recalled” from the moment of speaking.
The
term,: WON-PAST makes sense in terms of the semantic potential
of the tense category in Warao, a language which besides
referring to past and recalled events, with equal ease refers
to current or subsequent ones.

"SECTION THREE: MORPHOLOGYMorphologically, Warao is a highly-inflective language that
profusely uses both prefixation and suffixation.
On the
grounds of such a morphological trait, the first distinction
that is relevant for the Warao parts-of-speech system is that
between nominals and verbs. Nominals group all those speech
parts that totally or partially share a common set of prefixes
and/or suffixes. Verbs differentiate from nominals given their
particular set of prefixes and suffixes, which do not overlap.
Nominals include nouns (within which attributive nouns— or
adjective-like items— are sub-classed since they are not fully
differentiated from nouns), numerals, pronouns and adverbials
(normally denominals attaching noun inflection markers). Verbs
are
represented by both finite and
non—finite
forms.
Postposition is a closed class of syntacic relationals.
Finally, determiners constitute a class of its own.",[49]
"24.1. General modifiersThese
items
and
attributive nouns
do
not
differ
morphologically. Their adverbial connotation is set up by the
relationship they hold with the verb to which they adjoin. For

i^i'-i‘Manner :is usually expressed by the pair tuatane ’thus' and
tuatane ana 'not thus"" preceding verbs. This usage suggests an
extra pragmatic -force in the verb:

'He did not do (it) (not) thus'Furthermore, manner may be denoted by the postposition tane
'manner/way of doing something’ attached to nouns, which gives
rise to postpositional phrases functioning as either comple­
ments in copulatives, or adjuncts in other types of sentences:

"ImAs for morphology and syntax, the speakers of any language,
may
accomplish a great many communicative tasks with i the
sentences of their language. In this regard, Sadock & Zwicky
(1979) note that speakers'
conventional conversational uses
let narrate a tale, report what someone knows or has heard,
suggest a joint action, give permission to do something, 1 and
so on. For some of these uses, a language will have
specific
syntactic constructions, or even specific forms, reserved (just
for these uses— special particles, affixes,
word
order,
elliptical
arrangements, etc.— that will keep a connection
with the rales of the
participants and that ultimately will
depend upon particular styles. All of the above lead to
conclude that style heavily conditions the lexicon, phonology,
morphology and syntax of a language. Under such circumstances,
styles are code variants of language used in specific ways and
with particular purposes.
In mast of the investigations conducted on Warao---and 'this
is perhaps true of many studies an South American native
languages— emphasis is assigned to structure and little, has
been said about style as a conditioning factor of structure.
In native languages of South America, the linguisic area in
which
Warao
belongs, there are styles which
may
be
distinguished without any knowledge of the code as structure.
Such is the case in Shakleng (Urban; 1985, 1986a,
1986b), a
language in which some ceremonial dialogues characterize by
formal features such as the level of pitch, the metered
syl1ibification,
the
explosive
pharyngealized
and
1aryngealized
articulation,
and so
forth.
Thus,
any
listener-- even without knowing how to speak Shokleng— will
accept that a specific style is in use. Style and structure in
this sense are opposed concepts. Nevertheless, there are other
instances in which the distinctiveness of structure and style
is a limiting factor. One such case is Xavante (Braham, 1986),
a language in which the discaursive sequences of the ritual
specialist known as the 'a'ama involves large stylistic
lexical substitutions using the basic morphology and syntax of
Xavante. This style of the 'a* ama is not marked by distinctive
intonation, metering or voice quality. As a result, listeners
cannot distinguish this style of use from ordinary Xavante
language just by listening to it. In this sense, Xavante
behaves differently from Shakleng in which the different style
of the ceremonial dialogue given its special phonological
characteristics may be identified with no knowledge of the
structure. Urban (1987) points out that the 'a *ama style is a
structure-dependent
code
variant.
Insofar
as
it
is
structure—dependent, the features that allow one to pick out
the style are also features employed in building the code as
structure. Based upon the Xavante experience, Urban
(1987)
suggests a view of the relationship between language and style
as in TABLE 23 below

"; Moreover, , demonstrati ve,; pronouns inflect for case denoting
DAT
and
ABL
functions.
In the
case
of
DAT—marked
demonstratives, the suffix 1— (i)si 'to/for' gets attached to it
to signal .beneficiary. The :resulting demonstrative often
operates! as •an argument within the direct abject, but less
frequently is; found within'the!direct object. — (i)si
'to/for'

one’j ,ta;(i) ’that one’ and.iamaha 'that yonder' bringing about
’ll
Mill ^61the farms tamahaisi ‘to this one', taisi 'to that cine’ and
amahaisi ’ta that yonder’. However, the plural farms tamahaltuma, hamama ’these', tatuma ’those' and amahatuma 'those yon­
der' never take —isi ‘to/for', but rather postpose saba
'ta/for', as illustrated in (141)

For ABL-marked demonstratives, the suffix —mo ’from’ , is
added to them to express source. Such as in the case of the
DAT-marked demonstratives, -mo ’from* suffixation is restric­
ted to the singular forms; the plural ones postpase ta. 'from'.

In Warao,
independent.parts of the sets of personal pronouns are
or free morphemes in all of their possible63Ioccurrences in sentences, whether they identify singular or
plural persons. Also, parts of the sets of subject and abject
personal pronouns may be affixed, or bound, to verbs. These
sets of bound morphemes are reduced in number, and they ; are
restricted to the first and second singular person as well as
the first person for both subject and object functions.
j
The subjective free pronouns (hereafter IND PRO's) and the
bound ones
(hereafter SUF PRO's) arrange in a system as
follows in TABLE 11:

"Interrogative and indefinite determinersAs in a number of Amazonian languages, WaraD has a small set
of determiners which show two major uses:
indefinite I and
interrogative. These are
!a. sina'who/some/any'b. kasi kaha 'what/some/any’
TABLE 4: Interrogative
determinersandindefiniteThe two major senses for each determiner are linked, iWhat
the determiners indicate is that the identity of an entity is
not known to the speaker. The interrogative sense may be
engendered, depending on content although it may be morpholo­
gically instantiated by the verb suffix —ra 'INTERROG'.

This is a class of three members which shares with nouns the
suffixation of the number marker -tuma 'PL'. The paradigm of
Warao demonstrative determiners is presented in TABLE 3 belowPROXIMAL

determiners, which locate their heads with respect to the
deictic center of the speech situation in at least three
degrees of distance.
Such demonstrative determiners
may
indistinctly precede or follow head nouns within noun phrases,
though postceding seems to be most widely spread:

"DIRECT SPEECHinWarao
allows direct—quote complements only
with
the
utterance verb dibukitane 'to say'. The Warao speaker merely
passes on the direct quote complement as a more-or— less
verbatim quotation. Conversely, indirect-quote complements do
not occur in the language. In these respects, Warao behaves as
most languages,
in which indirection
""is absent probably
because it implies a certain paraphrase that leads to take
editorial responsibilities on the part of speakers.
Those
responsibilities are reflected in the control of co-reference
pronouns.
Thus, speakers of such languages take a much more
limited
responsibility
restricting
themselves
to
direct-quotes,
which, of course, exert
less
editorial
tampering"" (Giv6n, 1983:121).
InWarao,thequote(orspeechbeingquoted)occursf
1
sentence-initially,
in the position generally taken
by ,
sentential objects and complements. Examples are shown in (6).
Although indirect quotation is not -found in the language,
there is a verb suffix —vama 'BY HSY’ <= ""by hearsaying-),
that expresses the non—responsibility of the speaker for 'the
speech he employs and which transmits
almost
textual
information from other source. In this sense. — vama 'BY HSY'
suggests indirection:

Also, TABLE 13 reveals that such local

iFrom the review of (146— 151), :the facts of importance about
Warao; .’subjective IND PRD’s' are: (i) they— if overtly espressed--are placed immediately before verbs;
i.e., they are
preverbal
items, and (ii); they do not correlate with verb
morphemes for the marking’of agreement
(the verbal suffix
number —na ’sg’ keeps identity with singular subjects— whether
pronobns i or! full nouns— but, its main function seems to be
that ;of helping to recover omitted subjects, particularly
those- vin; ; third singular person which are seldom uttered.
PjLural iisuibjects have zero marking).
Differently from subjective IND F'RO’s, subjective SUF PRQ’s
appear : onlyr „as closing morphemes within verbal suffixal
chains. The case ,is illustrated, in (152— 154) below
T

structures intended for specific purposes, depending upon who
is speaking;, to whom the speech is addressed, the topic into
consideration arid the place ! and time of such a speech
co—occurrence. SUF PRO’S ar'fe typical in styles of conversation
used in Warao councils. Inilevery day life conversation, BUF
PRO’s! are hardly heard, if, ever. It is my opinion, that SUF
F'RO's.; ‘indeed i are variants of the subjective pre—verbal
IND
P RO’S (that ’give the message in which appear a touch of
authority; associated, with the most elevated statuses of the
