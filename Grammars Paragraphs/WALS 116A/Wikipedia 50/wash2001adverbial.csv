All complement clauses follow the matrix verb. They are finite in that
they are inflected for person. Sometimes they are inflected for tense and
aspect. Forms of the complementizer may vary. In most cases, the dependent
proclitic hi= links the complement clause to its matrix verb. A less common
complementizer is Gu, which is historically related to the purposive adverbial
conjunction Gu ‘so that, in order to' and the general conjunction Gu ‘and;
but; such that'. Finally, in rare tokens, the complementizer is ka=. Below areexamples of complement-taking predicates together with their complement
clauses.
e Verbs of utterance
Verbs of utterance, such as 'say', 'tell', 'ask', etc., may or may nothave a complementizer in the complement clause. If there is a
complementizer, it is almost always the dependent clitic hi=, as in (292). In
rare instances it is ka=, as in (293).

"The old-timers washed their teeth out using the finger every morning. '22.2.5 Referent trackingSometimes a temporal clause tracks a participant that is (re-)introduced
as a full NP, and core argument, in the associated main clause. For example,
a full object NP in the main clause might be coded as the subject, via a
pronominal affix, in the temporal clause. Thus a New referent in the main
clause becomes a Given referent in the temporal clause. (The terms 'New'
and 'Given' refer to aspects of the theory of information flow as discussed
in Chafe 1976, 1987, 1992, 1994, Givén 1979, 1983, 1984, 1990, Prince 1981
and Du Bois 1987.) The temporal clause further specifies something about
that referent--what it does, what it thinks, or what state of mind or health itis in, and so on. Temporal clauses that track a full NP in the associated main
clause are always postposed. This pattern is similar to what Ford and
Thompson (1986:360) found for final conditional clauses in written English.
Their study concluded that new, heavy or important subject NPs tend to be
introduced in independent clauses instead of dependent clauses, because the
shared, unchallengead background that the dependent clause provides is not
the optimum place for such NPs to occur. Dependent clauses of any sort, be
they relative clauses, complement clauses, or adverbial clauses, are rarely the
venue for introducing discourse-deployable referents. (Discourse-deployable
referents are those entities that are mentioned again and again in the
discourse.) If an adverbial clause has the sole task of giving further
information about a discourse-deployable referent that is introduced in the
associated main clause, it makes for easier cognitive processing if the adverbial
clause is postposed instead of preposed. By using a pronoun in the adverbial
clause to refer to this discourse-deployable referent, the speaker assumes that
the listener already knows who or what is being talked about. If the adverbial
clause were preposed, the listener might not be sure who or what the pronoun
is referring to. It might be anaphoric, referring to someone or something
mentioned earlier in the story, or it might be cataphoric, referring to the new
referent coded with a full NP in the following clause. (This last point is also
made by Ford and Thompson (1986:371) for final conditional clauses in
written English.)
502Several examples that illustrate this pattern for temporal clauses are
shown below. In each case, the temporal clause gives further information
about the referent of a full NP in the associated main clause.
Tn the short text in (34), the main clause introduces the full obiect NP
hi=loklesiya 'Lucrecia'. This NP becomes the subject in the postposed
temporal clause, and is coded with the third subject pronominal prefix s-.

above, unlike what we saw for conditional clauses that explore options,
establish contrasts and repeat claims. The exemplification of a generalization
does not necessarily have to involve lexical overlap, as it often must for the
previous three tasks. However, lexical overlap plays a role in those conditional
clauses that do the fourth task (exemplifying), if the generalization in question
is being exemplified by two or more conditional clauses. When this happens
one sees a parallel structure among the conditional clauses that do the task
of exemplifying. For example, in (17), the excerpt begins with Mary Yee
stating the generalization that the Chumash and the Spanish (of more olden
times) were very superstitious people (lines a. - d.). She focuses on the
Spanish (lines e. and f.), and gives four examples of their superstitions (lines
g. - n.). Conditional clauses introduce the superstitions in turn.",[462]
"TheNo les gusta agua salada [<they don’t like salt water>].conditionalclausein lined.‘butif theydon’tcomedown',hassignificant lexical overlap with the clause that immediately precedes it, ' they
come down right away'. It thus establishes an explicit contrast with the
preceding material. The second contrastive conditional, '[Because] if they
don’t escape the freshet' (line f.), does not explicitly link up to anything in the
prior text. It establishes a contrast with the implicit assumption, in the
preceding discourse, that the salamanders instinctively know to escape the
freshet by climbing up the hill before a big rain and staying on the hill until
the rain stops.
Negation that is involved in establishing contrasts does not necessarilyhave to appear in the conditional clause, as it does in examples (9) and (10).
For example, in (11) line b., the negative prefix e- appears in an independent
clause, preceding the conditional clause in line c.

"5. The adverbial clause examples here are formatted in the following way. The
example number at the left is followed by a content label for the narrative in
which the example appears, along with a narrative text number assigned by me
in my database. The narrative text number is followed by the line number(s)
of the example from that text. The source of the example is given next.
Examples from Harrington’s written recordings indicate the ree] number and
- frame number(s) of the microfilm from which the example was taken.
Microfilm reel numbers refer to those listed in Mills and Brickfield 1986.
Examples with four lines begin with a transliteration of Harrington’s
phonetic transcription. I include a hyphen in the phonetic line if it appears to
me that Harrington was using it as part of his phonetic transcription;
otherwise, it is left out. The ways in which these kinds of hyphens can be
distinguished in Harrington’s notes are discussed in Wash 1997.
The second line shows the morphemes and morphological boundaries,
as well as epenthetic laryngeal consonants. An equal sign (=) follows clitics.
A hyphen (-) follows affixes. Finally, a plus sign (+) indicates that the affix in
question is lexically fused to the rest of the stem.
The third line gives glosses. (See the List of Abbreviations page.)
The fourth line gives a free translation. On many occasions Harrington
provided only a partial translation or no translation at all for a given line of
text. Apparently this was to save time. Harrington worked with three
generations of people who spoke the Barbareho language. He could speak
Barbareho and apparently understood just about everything Mary Yee said
in the language. Any translations or partial translations that are provided by
me are given in angled brackets: < >. Otherwise, all translations can be
assumed to be given by the original recorder, i.e. Harrington, Beeler, or their
28Barbarenho consultants. It is important to note that, for most of Harrington’s
texts used in my database, his free translations are usually not line-by-line
translations. Rather, the translations, when given, appear at the end of a text
as part of a synopsis of what that text is about. All of the angled-bracket
translations from me, however, are specifically line-by-line translations. All
interlinear analyses in the examples are my own, including the examples from
Beeler and Whistler 1980, in which I substituted my interlinear gloss in place
of theirs.","[50, 51]"
"Their main function is that of qualifying the meaning of the main clause
proposition. These two factors alone, i.e. i) that the adverbial clause does not
have a global role in structuring the discourse and ii) that the adverbial clause
serves mainly in the localized role of qualifying the meaning of the main
clause, are often enough motivation for the adverbial clause to assume a
postposed position. In this sense, the postposed position is the default position
for adverbial clauses. (Since topics and themes come first rather than last, in
the order of topic-comment and theme-rheme, the adverbial clause that is not
serving in a topic-like or theme-like capacity, ie. as a point of orientation,
would most likely be postposed.) There are, however, other factors that
increase the probability of an adverbial clause appearing postposed instead of
preposed: i) referent tracking; ii) an embedded main clause; iii) a main clause
that already has preposed material, such as a topicalized NP or a preposed
adverbial clause; iv) the adverbial clause has the additional function of an
afterthought or reminder; v) the adverbial clause is part of a routinized
construction in which the adverbial clause is always in final position; and
finally, specific to temporal clauses, vi) the adverbial clause codes a terminal
temporal boundary.
For some of these factors, to understand why they increase the
likelihood that an adverbial clause will be postposed it is helpful to look to the
theory of information flow (Chafe 1976, 1987, 1992, 1994), the principle of
least effort (Zipf 1935) and iconic motivation in language (Haiman 1983), all
of which are interrelated. Considering first the factor of referent tracking, we
saw that an adverbial clause tends to be final if it is tracking a referent that
was introduced (or re-introduced) into the discourse context as a full NP in
the associated main clause. The full NP has New information status in the
main clause, as it is being activated or re-activated in the listener’s
consciousness. In the postposed adverbial clause, the NP acquires Given
status, as it is then already activated in the listener’s consciousness, and thereferent is indexed as a pronominal affix instead of as a full NP. A reversal of
the clausal order would in many cases lead to ambiguity in meaning, as it
would not in all cases be clear who or what was being referred to, by the
pronominal affix, if the adverbial clause were preposed.
Other factors underscore the importance of conceptual relevance and
(hence) iconic motivation in the ordering of clauses. A clause is more likely553to be contiguous to the clause whose meaning it qualifies or completes. Thus
in all cases where the main clause was embedded, the adverbial clause wasnever preposed. If the main clause in question was a complement clause, the
adverbial ciause did not come between it and its matrix verb. If the main
clause in question was a relative clause, the adverbial clause did not come
between it and its head NP in the matrix clause. In the former case, it wouldbe infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the matrix verb
and complement clause, because the complement clause completes the
meaning imparted by the matrix verb, while the adverbial clause adds further
information about the complement clause. In the latter case, it would be
infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the head NP and
relative clause, because the relative clause provides information that is directly
relevant to the head NP, while the adverbial clause provides information that
is directly relevant to the relative clause. The clausal orders are iconically
motivated in that the clauses most conceptually relevant to each other are
always positioned next to each other. Such iconically motivated clausal orders
should require the least cognitive effort in processing information about the
events and states named by the clauses in question.
Iconic motivation also has a crucial role in the factor specific to
temporal clauses: in the corpus, temporal clauses that code terminal
boundaries tend to be postposed rather than preposed. The motivation is
iconic in that terminal-boundary temporal clauses code events that happen last
in a given series of events. Hence, the clauses that code them tend to be last
in a given series of clauses. The only exceptions are those that also perform
as pivotal points of orientation, making reference to a prior event and also
providing a context in which a succeeding event occurs. In such cases there is
a competing motivation: terminal events are last in a given series of events
and hence should be coded by final clauses, but pivotal points of orientation
need to be coded first in a given a series of clauses, because they provide
crucial, contextualizing information for the following event(s) or situation(s).
In such cases, the latter motivation takes precedence. So the terminalboundary temporal clause, which would otherwise be postposed, has to be
preposed in those cases.
Adverbial clauses also tend to be final when the associated main clause
already has preposed, associated material, such as a topicalized NP or another
adverbial clause. This preposed, associated material is already doing the task
of setting a scene or otherwise breaking the discourse into thematicallycoherent chunks. It is not necessary (or perhaps even possible) for the
adverbial clause in question to assume that role, so it assumes the postposed
354position. Another possible reason that the adverbial clause is final, in such
cases, is that it might too much of a cognitive burden to have so much
pragmatically-marked material preposed to the main clause, especially in a
initio! language Uke Darhasohn Chumas
Finally, adverbial clauses that serve as reminders or afterthoughts are
always final. The order is again iconically motivated in that reminders and
afterthoughts are comments on events and situations that were mentioned in
the preceding context, and the clausal order reflects this by the fact that
reminders and afterthoughts are coded by final clauses.
Relative propensity toward having a global roleThe adverbial clauses in part IV differ in the degree to which they
perform global, discourse-organizing tasks. The percentage of preposed tokens
reflects their relative propensities toward having a global role. Purpose
clauses, with 9% being preposed, were the least likely to do anything other
than qualify the main clause. Conditional clauses, with 86% being preposed,
were the most likely to perform discourse-structuring tasks. Neutral clauses
were second, followed by temporal clauses. The distribution of the clausal
tokens by position is summarized in Table 63.","[575, 576, 577]"
"<They use the lower leaves of the mugwort, which are dry. They shape it with the
fingers. They shape it like an acorn, its point facing up, but its bottom, it is stuck to

light its tip, and as it burns down, the person suffers very much. And when it burns
out, there is no longer any sore place. Sometimes they don’t burn the sore, they
bleed it instead. They slashed it with a flint that they use. They do not wipe the blood
off, they let it clot instead. >23.1.4 Exemplifying a preceding generalizationLike conditional and temporal clauses, neutral clauses may also develop
a discourse by introducing examples to illustrate a preceding generalization.
Only 9% of the neutral clause tokens perform this function, however. Four
examples of these neutral clauses are seen in the following two narrative
excerpts. In (13), the neutral clauses in question appear in lines b. and f. They

"12.2 Non-adverbial Gukanu clauses
There are several non-adverbial clauses that have the Gukanu
conjunction. To a certain extent, these non-adverbial clauses reflect the
patterns of subject marking that we have seen in the adverbial Gukanu
clauses. In the non-adverbial clauses, the conjunction translates variously as
‘so that; and so; such that; that is why'. Unlike the adverbial clauses, nonadverbial Gukanu clauses with the same subject as the preceding clause
always retain the subject pronoun. For example, in (26), the same subject is
indexed on the verbs with the second person subject pronoun p-. The
éukanu conjunction in question happens to have scope over two clauses (lines

hold its mouth shut, for about half a minute.> Now, they said, eat eggs! '8.5 Differences among na clauses, mali‘when' clauses and haku‘if’clauses with respect to level of expectation and likelihoodAs has been pointed out by Thompson & Longacre (1985:193), Givén
(1990:830, 832-833), and Comrie (1986), many languages code distinctions in
conditional and time clauses, distinctions that have to do with the speaker’s
level of expectation about the possibility or hypotheticality of the event in
question. For example, Thompson and Longacre (1985:193) state that the
difference between the English sentences 'If he comes, you will see him' and
205""When he comes, you will see him' is that the latter, 'when he comes"",
codes a higher level of likelihood or expectation that the event 'he comes'
will occur. Thus with the English conjunction 'when', the speaker has a
Fe
hia
ees
higher expectation that he will come; with ‘if’, the speaker
has
a lowei
expectation that he will come.
Like English and many other languages, Barbareno Chumash codes the
speaker’s level of expectation via the choice of an adverbial conjunction. This
is particularly clear for three of the adverbial conjunctions: mali 'when', na
‘if; when' and haku ‘if; whether'. The schematic in Figure 3 shows where
these conjunctions stand, relative to each other, on a scale of expectation,
likelihood, and hypotheticality.haku‘if!na‘if; when'mali<‘when!
>LowerhigherFigure 3. Level of expectation or likelihood that a given event will occur
By choosing one of the three adverbial conjunctions over the other, Barbareno
speakers could indicate how likely or unlikely they felt a given event orsituation to be. Generally, when the haku 'if' conjunction is used, the event
or situation named in the adverbial clause is the least likely to occur but not
altogether impossible. When the na ‘if; when' conjunction is used, the event
or situation is indeed possible but not necessarily expected to occur. Finally,
when the mali 'when' conjunction is used, the event or situation is not only
likely to occur, but it may also be expected to occur.
My analyzed Barbareho Chumash corpus does not contain any data
sets that minimally contrast all three conjunctions. However, the following text
excerpts illustrate the foregoing generalizations. We will start with situations
typically coded with a haku '‘if' conjunction.
haku 'if' clauses typically name situations or events that the speaker
feels are least likely to occur in the daily course of life. This generalization
applies to conditional haku '‘ift clauses as well as to semantically neutral
haku clauses. (The generalization does not, however, apply to those
206grammaticized haku constructions that have meanings such as ‘it does not
matter whether...'.) For example, in the textlet in (26), the topic is about a
particular kind of comet and the omen it portends. The conditional haku ""if!
weesserew
clause codes thetw eae
highly unlikely,
hypothetical situation of seeing a rare kind of
comet--one that is red in color.","[227, 228, 229]"

especially troubling because it appears that Harrington changed his

as being caretakers of the bear.) Two Gu adverbial clauses follow the main

adverbial clauses. It is indexed with the third person prefix s- in the first éu
clause, but there is no subject pronoun on the verb in the second Gu clause.

subject does not have much control over its situation. Instead, it is the main
clause subject that has control. In (15), the main-clause shaman is able to
scare away the adverbial-clause ghost. In (16), the main-clause people are able
to make the adverbial-clause bear calm down by providing it with honey.
(Presumably an out-of-control bear cannot, on its own volition, change its state
of mind.) Yet, this lack of control on the part of the adverbial clause subject
is not what accounts for the absence of the subject prefix in those Gu clauses.
If lack of control were a motivation, then the subject prefix would be absent
in all of the Gu clauses seen earlier in (7) though (10), where the main clause
subject has control over what happens to the adverbial clause subject.
The most likely reason that the third person prefix s- does not appear
in the Gu clause verbs in question is that the s- would be difficult to
pronounce or hear, given the kind of phonetic environment they are in. In
each of these tokens, the Gu-clause verb stem begins with a sibilant, ie. [s]or remy. Also, in (15), in the éu-clause verb stem suxnihan 'to scare
away', the next consonant after the stem initial [s] is the velar (or back
velar) fricative [x]. Given these facts, it is possible that articulatory difficulties
rendered the third pronominal prefix s~ unpronounced. For example, in (15),
251the Gu clause verb is phonetically [Gu.su.xi-.fhan]. If the third
pronominal prefix s- were to be pronounced, Mary Yee would have had to
aspirate the stem-initial [s ] of the verb, and thus say [éu. s®u.xi:.han ]2The Gu-clause verbs in (16) line d. and (17) would also have the difficult
pronunciation of [Gus.é""o- ], if the third pronominal prefix s- were to be
pronounced. Given the close proximity of so many sibilants and fricatives, this
articulation would be especially cumbersome, except perhaps in unnaturally
slow speech. In the regular rate of speech, it would be much easier to say
[Gu.su.xi:han] and [Gu.é""6: ], which are the attested forms.
11.2 Tense, aspect and modality in Gu clausesTense and aspect morphology is rare in Gu adverbial clauses. None of
these clauses show any past tense marking, such as would be seen with the
past tense suffix -was or the habitual prefix qili- ‘used to'. Only 5 of the
53 tokens show any tense marking at all. Each of these 5 tokens has the future
tense prefix sa?-. These tokens tend to have a main clause that depicts an
unrealized event. One reason the main clause event is unrealized is that it
never happened or just does not ever happen. In such main clauses negation
appears on the verb, signalled with the prefix e-, and the Gu clause has the
future tense prefix sa?-. An illustration is given in (18). The negated main
clause appears in line c.; its corresponding Gu clause follows it in line d. This
pair of clauses contrasts thematically with the non-negated main clause in line
a. and its corresponding Gu clause in line b. In the passage below, Mary Yee
talks about customary and non-customary uses for the hallucinogenic datura
plant. The first two clauses denote what the norm was, the second pair of
clauses denote what the norm was not.","[271, 272, 273, 274]"

These nominalized clauses are from different texts that discuss methods
of locking up homes and other structures long ago. In (270) the nominalized
verb has the object argument hi=l=ku
‘a person, some person'. The
nominalized verb in (271), which differs only by having a past tense suffix,
does not have any NP arguments. Both nominalized clauses mean basically the
79|same thing: 'one who was unknown! or 'one who they (indef.) did not
know '. In head-marking languages, especially, NPs that are clausal arguments
further delineate or elaborate upon the information encoded in the head verb.
Thus NPs within nominalized clauses are dependent elements on the verb and
not vice versa.®

2iyeme‘although; even if' Clauses10.0 IntroductionAdverbial clauses with the conjunction 2iyeme ‘though, although;
even if‘ are another adverbial clause type in my corpus. There are only 11
tokens of this type: 3 are preposed, 7 are postposed, and 1 occurs in medial
position.
The 2?iyeme conjunction appears to be derived from a particle * 2iye
(meaning uncertain) and the emphatic clitic he ‘just, merely’. The particle
* 2iye appears to be cognate with Ineseho 2iya'and; even', which is foundin the Ineseho adverbial conjunction 2iyapa ‘even if; even though'
(Applegate 1972a). Also, the 2iye- in ?iyemhe is doubtless the same
morpheme as the 2?iye- in the Barbareho conjunction 2iyena '(even) if',
discussed briefly in chapter 8. Adverbial clauses with 2 iyeme code concessive
relations and concessive conditional relations. These relations are discussed in
turn in sections 10.1 and 10.2. One of the ?iyeme clause tokens is
discontinuous--a situation whereby the adverbial conjunction is separated from
the rest of its clause by an intervening noun phrase or another adverbial
clause. This one token is discussed in 10.3. A summary is given in 10.4.
10.1 2iyeweclauses that code concessive relationsAll of the2iyemeadverbialclauseshavebeenfoundto codeaconcessive relation with a main clause, though a subset of these also code a
concessive conditional relation. As Givdén states (1990:835), a concessive
relation involves
'...a presupposed contrast or counter-expectancy, with the ADV-clause
supplying the grounds for the counter-expectation, and the main clause
supplying the less-likely event or state'.
For example, in the English sentence ' although he liked her, he stayed away '
(from Givén 1990:835), the concessive clause ' although he liked her' provides
the grounds for the counter-expectation supplied in the main clause 'he
stayed away'. In Barbareho Chumash, only the 2? iyeme adverbial clause type
has been found to code concessive relations.
232A preposed 2iyeme clause is given in (1) line c., its corresponding
main clause is in line d. The concessive clause 'though you holler at them'
provides the grounds for the counter-expectation in the main clause 'they

<no matter how ugly he is / however ugly he is.>233Thompson and Longacre (1985:198-199) state that there are two kinds
of concessive adverbial clauses: definite and indefinite. Definite concessive
clauses have a concessive conjunction like English ""although ' or Barbareno
Chumash ?iyeme. The indefinite concessive clauses typically contain an
indefinite pronoun or question word, such as 'whoever', 'what', or 'how',
as in 'No matter what he said, she still refused to go out with him' or
""Whoever he is, ’m not opening the door’ (1985:199). The example in (2)
above illustrates both the qualities of definite and indefinite concessive
clauses: it has the conjunction ?iyeme, and at the same time it has the
indefinite question word 2akay ‘how much'. None of the Barbareho
Chumash concessive clauses were found to have indefinite elements without
the conjunction 2iyeme.
10.2 2iyeme clauses that code concessive conditional relationsSeveral tokens of the 2? iyeme clause type code a concessive conditional
relation. Concessive conditional clauses are often referred to as ‘even if'clauses (Thompsonand Longacre1985, Givén 1990), as in the Englishsentence ‘Even if it rains we'll have our picnic' (from Thompson and
Longacre 1985:196). Crosslinguistically, these clauses are similar to the regular
conditional clauses in a given language, but they carry a contrary-toexpectation presupposition not normally found in the ordinary conditional
clauses for that language (Thompson and Longacre 1985). In Barbareno
Chumash, a concessive conditional clause has the conjunction 2iyewhe
‘although, though; even if"". (Cf. however example (8) in chapter 8, where the
adverbial clause has the conjunction 2iyena ‘if’, which leans toward a
concessive conditional meaning.) Also, it may be followed by the conjunction
haku 'if' or na ‘if in the same adverbial clause. The main clause may have
markers of irrealis modality, such as the future prefix sa2-, that underscore
the hypothetical nature of the conditional relation. An example is given in (3).
The concessive conditional clause in line b. also happens to be in medial
position. It appears to be in a dependent relation with the main clause
preceding it and the main clause following it.

<you just will not see one.>As we have seen with the concessive clauses in (1) and (2), the
adverbial clause above in line b. has the conjunction 2?iyeme. Unlike the
other tokens, however, this token also has the adverbial conjunction haku
‘if'. This token satisfies the criteria of conditional relations in that: (i) the
adverbial clause states a hypothetical condition, ‘even if he is old', and (ii)
the main clauses (lines a. and c.) are marked by an irrealis operator, in this
case the future tense prefix sa?-. It is also noteworthy that the emphatic
proclitic me
and the emphatic suffix -2 accompany these concessive
conditional relations, as seen in the main clauses of (3) above. Such
morphosyntax underscores the contrary-to-expectation meaning in the
concessive conditional relation.
Concessive conditionals with ?iyeme
and na '‘if' are unlike
prototypical conditionals in the sense that the main clause does not have an
irrealis operator such as the future prefix sa?2?-. However, emphatic
connotations are seen in the relation just as in the concessive conditional
relation that has the conjunction haku 'if' in (3). For example in (4) there
is the intensive qualifier noho? ‘very, much' in the adverbial clause. There
is also a pragmatically-marked, preposed NP in the main clause of line b.","[253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"

Sometimes in a maii clause construction there is no specific
morphology, in either the adverbial clause or the main clause, that indicates
a temporal relation. I still posit a temporal relation, however, if the mali
clause contains a word that specifies the time frame. This would satisfy
criterion (iii). For example in the text in (3), which is a procedural text aboutmaking posoli, the word ‘it is morning’ establishes the time frame in which

tense-aspect marking in the adverbial clause, the adverbial clause conjunction
is not semantically specific, and there is no lexical item within the adverbial
that indicates a time frame, a temporal interpretation of the adverbial clause
is still possible if the pragmatics of the context demands it. In these cases, I
also apply a process of elimination by seeing, for example, if the adverbial
clause makes just as much sense with a conditional interpretation, or a reason
interpretation, etc. In (4) and (5) there are two adverbial clauses from the
same procedural text, both of which happen to be minimal pairs. The version
in (4) appears to be a constructed sentence. The two adverbial conjunctions
in question, mali 'when' ((4) line d.) and wa ‘if; when' ((5) line c.) are
semantically non-specific. Both adverbial clauses have a temporal
interpretation in this context, however, because the context does not permitany other interpretation.

is therefore not possible with the adverbial clauses in (4) and (5), even though
the adverbial conjunction wa, in (5), can occur in clauses that have a
conditional interpretation. Only a temporal relation is acceptable for this
token.
1.9.2.2 Neutral relations
Sometimes none of the three criteria discussed above for temporal
clauses apply, nor does the context render a specific semantic interpretation.
In such cases, the would-be temporal clause can also have a conditional
meaning. Adverbial clauses in these cases are semantically neutral with respect
to conditionality and time. Two examples of neutralized adverbial clauses, a
na clause and a mali clause, are seen below in (6).

2-thoughtno se echa de ver que tienes mal pensamiento. '
<the fact that your thoughts are bad is not evident.>The adverbial clauses in lines a. and c. do not show clear evidence of
being temporal clauses or conditional clauses. For example, unlike most mali
clauses that have a temporal relation to the main clause, the mali clause in
line c. has no morphosyntax or lexical items that link the event in the main
clause to a specific time frame. Both the na and mali 'ifAvhen' clauses code
generic, habitual situations. The temporal and conditional relations are
conflated for those tokens. Neutralization of conditionality and time is
discussed briefly in Thompson and Longacre 1985:193. Most researchers put
neutral, 'ifAwhen' clauses into the conditional category (e.g. Thompson (p.c.),
Comrie1986, ter Meulen1986, Hacker 1998). In this dissertation, however,I treat neutral 'iffwhen' clauses as belonging to a category separate from the
conditional and temporal semantic categories.
1.9.2.3 Conditional relationsGenerally, an adverbial clause that provides the condition(s) under
which the event/state in the main clause occurs is analyzed in this dissertation
as a conditional clause. However, as discussed earlier, conditional relations canbe conflated with temporal relations in Barbareno, with the result that the
clause in question may not be a true conditional clause, even if it has an
adverbial conjunction that Harrington translates as ‘if’. In identifying a
21conditional clause, then, I looked for the following factors: (i) the adverbial
clause must code a hypothetical, i.e. unreal, situation; and, (ii) the main clause
must have one or more of the following features (following Givén 1990:829)
all of which underscore the irrealis nature of conditional constructions: the
modal verb uniyiw ‘to be necessary, to have to, should', the modal verb
alaqway‘can, to be able', the future tense prefix sa?-, the modal particlemay ‘would, should', a marker of certainty such as the particle pa ‘must be,
must have', the hortative particle kuhhe 'let it not be (that)', the particle
kimini 'then (in that case)', an imperative verb, an indirect request, or a
question. Negation in the main clause was another criterion I considered, since
in some languages all clauses that have negation are treated as irrealis (T.
Payne 1997). I decided not to treat negation as one of the structural criteria
in the identification of a conditional relation. However, in those cases whereI gave a conditional interpretation based on a pragmatic interpretation of the
context, i.e. where none of the above structural criteria were found in theassociated main clause, it was almost always the case that the main clause had
negation. These judgment calls were rare, however.
Following Givén (1990:831) a counterfactual conditional relation was
identified as one in which: (i) the adverbial clause has a firm and negative
truth-value; (ii) the adverbial clause has a realis operator such as the past
tense suffix -wa5; and finally, (iii) the main clause has an irrealis operator
such as future tense or a modal particle. Counterfactual clauses are rare in my
corpus, however.
The passage below has several conditional clauses: a conditional na
clause (line a.), a conditional haku clause (line c.), and a counterfactualconditional haku clause (line f.).

"21.1.2 Establishing contrastsA second discourse function that conditional clauses are known to have
is that of establishing contrasts with information given earlier in the discourse
(Thompson and Longacre 1985:222-223, Ford and Thompson 1986, Ford
1993). This function is another way that an initial conditional clause provides
a framework of shared information, through which the reader/listener
interprets the information in the immediately following discourse.
This function of establishing contrasts could be subcategorized under
the broader function of exploring options and alternatives (Ford 1993:56-59).
Contrasts often involve pairs of initial adverbial clauses, the first one
introducing one option, the second one establishing a contrast or opposing
option to the first option (Ford 1993; see also Longacre 1976:105-106 on the
relation between two-pronged contrasts and 'but' structures). In addition, as
we will see, in the Barbareho data there is significant lexical overlap both in
conditionals that introduce options and in conditionals that introduce
contrasts. However, in the Barbareno data, negation is always directly involved
in creating the contrasts that initial conditional clauses help to establish, but
negation may or may not play a direct role in helping initial conditional
clauses create options and alternatives. For this reason I treat these two
functions as being separate, though they are related. The important ingredient
of negation is echoed in the schematic formula in (7), which Ford and
Thompson (1986:357) give for this discourse function (though Ford and
Thompson do not suggest that contrasting conditionals must have a morpheme
that signals negation).",[454]
"Also,mehuclauseconstructions always depict unintentional acts or results. The differences in the
reason relations coded by these two clause types reflect distinctions betweeninternal and external motivations (Halliday and Hasan 1976, Givén 1990:834835), distinctions among action-based, knowledged-based and fact-based causal
relations (Schiffrin 1987), and distinctions among fourth-, third- and secondorder types of causal relations in the Entity Type Hierarchy (Hengeveld 1998),
in that mehuclausescodeexternal,fact-based,andsecond-ordercausalrelations.
There is an array of adverbial clause types that one can identify based
upon specific adverbial conjunctions. Thirteen such clause types are analyzed,
discussed and illustrated in chapters 4 through 16. These comprise almost all
of the adverbial clause types that have conjunctions in this language. There
may be other kinds of Barbareho adverbial clause types that have
117conjunctions, but some possible adverbial clause types were not included
because they could not be clearly identified as adverbial clauses. Also, a
possible adverbial clause type was omitted if there were not enough data orcontext that would allow a substantive-enough discussionand illustration for
that particular adverbial clause type. Still, the adverbial clause types discussed
and illustrated in chapters 4 through 16 range from the very rare ku ‘lest, so
that...not' adverbial clause type, which only has two tokens, to the numerous
na ‘if; when; in order to' adverbial clause type, which has nearly 200 tokens.
Part II has the following chapters, named for the adverbial conjunction
that identifies the adverbial clause type in question:

the adverbial conjunction, including its history and any cognates it is known to
have. Next is an overall view of the number of tokens the adverbial clause
type has, what kinds of semantic relations it codes, and what positions
(preposed or postposed) it may take. The body of each chapter then illustrates
each relevant semantic relation and the ways in which it is coded in that clause
type. Special attention is given to those issues and patterns that stand out, e.g.
unusual or prominent patterns in person marking, tense/aspect/modality, ways
in which the speaker’s point of view is coded, etc.
The focus of part II of the dissertation is upon 13 adverbial clause
types that have adverbial conjunctions. A much smaller subset of Barbareho
adverbial clauses lack adverbial conjunctions. They are discussed in chapter
3, to which we now turn.","[139, 140]"

(1985:222), has two conditional clauses that name options regarding when and

Exploring options and alternatives is the most common function that
Barbareno Chumash conditional clauses were found to have in my corpus:Out of the 76 preposed tokens, 31 (41%) have this role. Example (3) presents
an entire text about the kinds of animals one could have for a spirit helper or
talisman, referred to as 2atiSwin in the Barbareno Chumash language. The
structure of this narrative is centered around the choices of animals that one
could have for an 2atiSwin. The preferred choice (Prairie Falcon) is coded
by a superlative clause in line b. Four alternatives are then offered in lines d.
(Snake), g. (Skunk), k. (Rabbit) and n. (Bear). Each alternative is coded by
ana ‘if’ conditional clause. These conditionals have an unusual predicate
nominal form, of which more will be said later.","[446, 447]"
"An important distinction regarding point of view is coded in 2akay hu
clauses. For this clause type, speakers could indicate that the terminal event
was something that could be self-evident to anybody, i.e. something that could
be treated as a matter of course in the real world. Or, they could treat the
terminal event as one whose occurrence was subjective--subject to the opinion
or judgment of someone else. For narratives, the opinion or judgment in
question is that of the narrator or that of a protagonist within the story.
128The distinction in point of view is coded by the proclitic ka= 'then,
so' and the proclitic wa= 'if; when'. All 2akay hu clauses have one of
these two morphemes. In one rare instance, both appear in the same token.
2?akay hu clauses with only the proclitic ka= code a terminal event or action
that occurs as a matter of course in the real world, as the next step in a given
process; the event or action is seen as a self-evident fact. The fact of whether
or not the terminal boundary can occur or has occurred is treated, by the |
narrator of the story, as being independent of the narrative-internal
participant’s point of view or judgment. If, on the other hand, the 2akay hu
clause has the proclitic wa=, then the fact of whether or not the terminal
boundary can occur or has occurred is treated, again by the narrator of the
story, as being dependent upon the narrative-internal participant’s judgment
or point of view. Usually the narrative-internal participant is human, and is the
subject of the 2akay hu clause or the subject of the corresponding main
clause. First we will look at examples of 2akay hu clauses that have ka=.
A prototypical example of an 2?akay hu adverbial clause with ka= is
seen in (3) (previously part of (1)). The excerpt is from a text on making
posoli. In the 2akay hu clause event the corn skins or husks come off. This
event occurs as a matter of course from all the rubbing that occurs in the
main clause event. The fact of whether or not the 2akayhu clause event hasoccurred is not subjective: either the husks have come off or they have not;
it is a self-evident fact.","[150, 151]"
"Only about 60% of the relative clauses with oblique NPrels, however, are
nominalized..
Below are two sets of near-minimal] pairs that show some differences
between a basic clause and a relative clause construction in Barbareho
Chumash. In (320)b the relative clause is a Subject-relative, because the NPrel

clause 'that stood near the door of his house '. The third person pronoun sis not retainedin the relative clause. As wesawin 2.3.3.1,however,inBarbareho Chumash it is normal for nominalized clauses, including relative

co-referent of 'rocks' has the grammatical role of object in the relative clause
‘that they can throw at one another'. Note that the third person plural object
-wun is not suffixed to the relative clause verb in (321)b, but neither is it
suffixed to the main clause verb in (321) a. More study needs to be done on
where, when and why the plural object suffix -wun appears. This suffix most
_ often appears when the referents are human or otherwise animate, but it can
also appear when the referents in question are neither human nor animate.(321)

97Like the relative clause in (321), the relative clause in (322) is an
Object-relative. Structurally they are very different, however. Example (322)
illustrates the only relative-clause token in the analyzed corpus that has a
relativizer in the form of ka=. Like the contrastive focus marker and stative
proclitic of the same form, the relativizer ka= is a reflex of the protoChumash demonstrative *ka. The relative clause construction has a similar
form to the cleft construction illustrated earlier in (284), with the important
exception that the relative clause is not nominalized.

"In such relations, the adverbialclausedenotesahypothetical or unreal situation, and the main clause will typically have certain
lexical items and morphosyntax that further point to the irrealis nature of the
conditional relation (Givén 1990). For example, in Barbareno Chumash the
main clause may have a modal verb such as uniyiw 'to be necessary, to have
to, should' or alaqway 'can, be able, be possible', the future tense prefix
sa2-, the modal particle may 'would; should; might', the hortative particlekume'let it not be (that)...', a marker of certainty such as the particle pa‘must be, must have, probably, likely' or kalpas ‘surely, certainly', the
particle kimini 'then (in that case)', an imperative verb, an indirect

examples of these features in haku 'if' conditional clause constructions will
be illustrated throughout this section.

"Though there were not enough tokens of the 2iyemhe 'though; even if'
clause type to allow strong claims about the exact meanings that could be
conveyed, there is little doubt that Barbareho Chumash speakers were able
to make subtle distinctions in concessive and concessive conditional meanings
by varying the combination of these conjunctions and other morphosyntax.
Understanding how expectations and points of view are conveyed by
adverbial clause conjunctions is a difficult task, especially when the language
in question is no longer spoken and all of the data come from monologic
narratives. It would be doubtless enlightening to see how these conjunctions
were used in interactional contexts such as conversation. The analyses I have
offered give at best a glimpse of the ways that Barbareho Chumash people
once used these conjunctions to express, or to refrain from expressing, their
expectations and points of view.
351Part IIIInitial vs. Final Adverbial Clauses in Scope,Structure, and Punctuation/Prosodic Boundary352Introduction to Part OTThere are several major domains in which initial and final adverbial
clauses tend to differ. In part III of this dissertation we will explore three of
them for BarbarehoChumash:scope, morphosyntacticstructure,and thepresence or absence of a prosodic/punctuation boundary between the
adverbial clause and its main clause. All three of these domains reveal
different ways in which the semantic bond between a final clause and its main
clause is stronger, generally, than the bond between an initial clause and its
main clause.
Scope refers to the number of clauses to which the situation named by
the adverbial clause applies. In both spoken and written forms of speech,
preposed clauses are capable of having a much wider scope than postposed
clauses (Chafe 1984, Thompson1985, Thompson and Longacre 1985; Givén1990). As we will see in chapter 17, the data from Barbarenho Chumash
affirms this crosslinguistic pattern.
Initial and final clauses may differ with respect to morphosyntactic
structure. As will be shown in chapter 18, one of the major morphosyntactic
differences often seen between initial and final clauses in Barbareho Chumash
is that final clauses are explicitly marked as syntactically dependent by the
proclitic hi=, the ubiquitous marker of syntactic dependency in Barbarenho
Chumash grammar.
Finally, studies have shown that postposed adverbial clauses, with
certain exceptions, are less likely than preposed adverbial clauses to be
separated from the associated main clause by a prosodic boundary in spoken
speech, or by a punctuation mark in written speech (Chafe 1984, Quirk et al.
1985, Ramsey 1987, Givén 1990, Ford 1992, 1993). In chapter 19 we will seehow Harrington’s use of commas, periods, and even colons in his transcription
of Mary Yee’s speech falls into certain patterns with initial and final clauses.
These patterns give crosslinguistic support to claims that have been made
about prosodic and punctuation boundaries in adverbial clause constructions.
The main points and conclusions from chapters 17, 18 and 19 are
summarized and synthesized in the summary of part III.","[373, 374, 375]"

features of irreality found in conditional relations (Givén 1990). I code it as

codes an initial boundary, such that the main clause event 'Take notice!' is
only to occur upon the start of the adverbial clause event 'when you hear an

Though the Kayké and mehu clause types code reason relations with
a main clause, there are several subtle but substantive differences between
them. The characteristics that distinguish them are discussed in the following
four subsections.
15.1.1 Kinds of causal/reason relations
A subtle but important semantic distinction between mehu and kayké
""because' clauses concerns the kinds of causal/reason relations that the
adverbial clause codes, and the degree to which the causal relations are
treated as being self-evident. ehu reason clauses only code fact-based causal
relations, where there is a direct, causal relation between event X and eventY. They do not code motivations for speech acts, as kayké clauses do, nor do
they code causal relations that are not self-evident or which can only be
inferred with particular evidence or information. Verbs in mehu reason clauses
almost always denote a state of being of the subject in question. This state of
being then becomes the source or cause for the state of affairs named in the
corresponding main clause. Importantly, the cause/reason is not one that is
consciously intended (i.e. not consciously intended by the mehu-clause
subject). Likewise, the event or action in the corresponding main clause is not
something that the main-clause subject intentionally plans. Thus as we saw in
(1), the people’s state of being respectable is the reason their behavior does

"1.3 Sources of primary data
The data in this study come primarily from John P. Harrington’s
manuscript materials of linguistic and ethnographic work among the Chumash
people. These are catalogued in Mills and Brickfield 1986. Harrington’s notes
and recordings are the largest primary source of data for all of the Chumash
languages. From his work on the Barbarenho language alone he produced tens
of thousands of pages of field notes. From 1913 until a few years before his
death in 1961, Harrington worked with some of the last known speakers of
Barbareno. The best known of these were Luisa Ignacio, Juliana Ignacio, Juande Jesus Justo, Lucrecia Garcia, and Mary Yee. All of these people were
bilingual in Barbareho and Spanish; Mary Yee was also fluent in English. In
addition, Lucrecia Garcia and Mary Yee were able to read and write in
Barbareho. The data used in my study are mostly from the texts and
grammatical notes recorded by Harrington on paper from Mary Yee. Data
from other speakers will be cited when necessary.
During the time of his fieldwork, Harrington recorded languages on
paper, wax cylinders and aluminum discs. Convenient tools such as magnetic
tape recorders were not available until late in his career. He used a detailed
but idiosyncratic phonetic transcription when writing down a language, andoften did not write phonemically.? The consensus among linguists who knowHarrington’s work is that he had an extraordinarily acute ear for phoneticdetail (Callaghan1975,1976). ThusHarrington’s written recordingsofAmerican Indian languages are valued by present-day linguists for their
accuracy and reliability.
A second corpus of primary discourse data comes from Madison
Beeler, who worked with Mary Yee during a series of field trips from about
1954 through the early 1960s. To my knowledge, this corpus contains several
dozen notebooks and nine tape recordings.
William Bright worked with Mary Yee for a brief period in 1952. His
notes consist of wordlists and short paradigms.
There are other primary sources of data on Chumash languages. These
sources are primarily wordlists recorded in the 1700s and 1800s. The more
well-known of these were recorded by Arroyo de la Cuesta in 1833-36, Pinart
in 1878 (published in Heizer 1952), and Henshaw in 1884 (published in Heizer
1955).
1.4 Previous analyses of Barbareno Chumash*
A truly thorough description of the Barbareho Chumash language has
yet to appear, but one may find a clear and concise orientation to Barbareno4discourse and grammar in Ono’s 1996 dissertation. Sketches and analyses of
the Barbareno language are also found in Beeler 1970a and 1976, and in the
extensive, detailed footnotes given in Beeler and Whistler 1980. Detailed
discussions on dependent marking, relative clauses and related structures are
given in Wash 1999a and 1999b. There are also discussions and illustrative
examples touching upon many aspects of Barbareho grammar in Harrington’s
notes, especially in Reel 3, Volume 3, of the Kraus Microfilm Reel Edition(Mills and Brickfield 1986). In addition to these sources there are two articles
on the placement and functions of glottalization (Mithun et al. 1994, Ono et
al. 1994). Two studies have been published on sibilant harmony in Barbareho
(Beeler 1970b, Mithun 1997). Finally, there is a phonological study on
reduplication, which is a prominent phonological and grammatical process in
all Chumash languages (Wash 1995).
No comprehensive dictionary of the Barbareno language has yet been
published. However, Beeler (1979) published a list of approximately 1,000
words, Whistler (1980) followed up on this work with a working dictionary
containing about 2,000 words. There is also a helpful glossary of terms from
several different Chumash languages. in volume five of the Hudson and
Blackburn (1986) series.
1.5 Theoretical orientation
This dissertation is based on a functionally-oriented approach to
linguistics. A functionally-oriented approach seeks to understand language in
all of its cognitive, communicative, socio-cultural and diachronic aspects. It is
the complex way in which these aspects of language interact that accounts for
the patterns observed in human languages, both individually and on a crosslinguistic basis. The complex interaction of these aspects of language is best
seen in the ways language is actually used. Hence, when linguists who follow
this approach seek to describe and explain why certain forms or structures
pattern as they do in a given language, they want to work with as much
context of the language as possible. They seek to have a database that is built
upon connected discourse rather than only single forms and structures elicited
out of context, the latter being the standard for some schools of linguistics.
Thus if the language under investigation has a community of speakers, a
functionally-oriented linguist will seek to record as many genres of naturally
occurring discourse as possible, including conversation and the telling of
stories. Such recordings are audiotaped and/or videotaped, and are
subsequently transcribed in a systematic way (e.g. Du Bois et al. 1993). From
such data, both qualitative analyses (e.g. Chafe 1980) and quantitative analyses
5(e.g. Givén 1983, Du Bois 1987, Fox and Thompson 1990 and Ford 1993
among many others) are possible.
One broad area of functional approaches to linguistics that is used in
this dissertation is the theory of INFORMATION FLOW (Chafe1976, 1987,1992,1994). According to this theory, the changing cognitive state of information in
the minds of the speaker and hearer motivate particular linguistic forms and
structures. For example, newly mentioned referents are commonly coded as
full NPs, because in this form the hearer is able to identify who the speaker
is talking about. Subsequent mentions of the same referent usually take
pronominal form, e.g. English 'he', 'she', 'it'. These forms of the referent
reflect its Given cognitive status. This theory is particularly helpful in part four
of this dissertation as we examine the relationship between mentions of
referents and clausal ordering in adverbial clause constructions.
The theory of information flow is connected to some extent to the
principle of least effort in the production and processing of language (Zipf
1935). This principle, along with the functionally-oriented notion of iconic and
economic motivation in language (Haiman 1983) will be shown to be relevant
in understanding the various patterns one finds with initial and final adverbial
clauses in Barbareno discourse, in parts three and four of the dissertation.
1.6 Literature review
Taken as a whole, the literature on adverbial clauses is immense. Thistopic has been written about from vastly different perspectives not only within
linguistics, but within other fields of learning such as philosophy. As discussed
in section 1.8, my data on Barbareno adverbial clauses occur within narrative
discourse. Most of the vast literature on adverbial clauses, however, deals withconstructed data. I am particularly interested in studies that examine adverbial
clauses within a discourse context, such as monologic narrative or
conversation, because such studies focus on questions and issues that are most
relevant to a functionally-oriented perspective on language. The following are
some of the sources that inform my descriptions and analyses of adverbial
clauses in Barbarefo, though these of course are not the whole extent of my
references to the adverbial clause literature in the dissertation: Haiman 1978,Chafe 1984, Thompson 1985, Thompson and Longacre 1985, Ford and
Thompson 1986, Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990, and Ford
1993,
Some of the sources mentioned above give an overview of adverbial
clauses from a functional and cross-linguistic perspective. Givén (1990)
discusses adverbial clauses in his chapter on interclausal coherence. First he
6gives a typology of adverbial clauses by semantic category, i.e. temporal,
conditional, cause and reason, concessive, substitutive, additive, and purposive.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"

Distribution of adverbial clauses by position and semantic relation
Parts III and IV of this dissertation explore the differences and
similarities between preposed and postposed adverbial clauses in Barbareno
Chumash. In part III we will see how these two groups differ with respect to
scope, morphosyntactic structure, and intonation/punctuation boundaries with
the corresponding main clauses. In part IV we will examine the differences
and similarities between these two groups with respect to their discourse
functions in Barbareno Chumash narrative discourse.
Tense, aspect and modality in the marking of semantic relationsDifferent patterns emerged in the usage of tense, aspectual and modal
morphosyntax among the adverbial clause types. These patterns were linked
to the kinds of semantic relations coded by the clause types in question.
345In the coding of temporal relations, those clause types with semantically
specific conjunctions like 2akayhu'‘until' and 2akimpi‘during, while;when ' had very little tense and aspectual morphology. These two clause types,
however, generally coded one specific kind of temporal relation: terminal
temporal boundaries for 2akay
hu ‘until’ clauses and simultaneous
temporal relations for 2akimpi 'during, while; when' clauses. On the other
hand, those clause types with semantically general conjunctions like mali
‘when' and na ‘if; when; in order to' required a variety of morphemes,
including tense/aspect morphology and words with temporal meaning, in order
to code temporal relations. With such morphology at its disposal, we saw that
the mali'when'clause type, especially, could code several different kindsof temporal relations--precedence, subsequence, terminal boundaries, initial
boundaries, and simultaneous temporal boundaries. Each of these different
varieties of temporal relations were characterized by different tense and
aspectual morphemes, as well as different temporally-related lexical items.
Relative tense played a key role in coding precedence ('before') and
subsequence ('‘after') temporal relations. An adverbial clause that coded
precedence named an event that was future relative to the event named by
the main clause, and thus tended to have the future tense prefix sa?-. On the
other hand, an adverbial clause that coded subsequence denoted an event that
was past relative to the event denoted by the main clause, and thus tended to
have the past tense suffix -waS. We saw a preponderance of imperfective
aspectual morphology in the coding of simultaneous temporal relations, but
again usually only in those adverbial clauses that lacked semantically specific
conjunctions, such as maii 'when' clauses. Such adverbial clauses, as well as
their main clauses, often had reduplication in the verb, and/or affixes that
denoted duration, iteration, and habitual past. In some instances, certain
temporally-oriented lexical items occurred either in the adverbial clause or in
its main clause in lieu of any tense and aspectual morphology. Such lexical
items rendered a temporal interpretation to the adverbial clause. In other
instances, an adverbial clause was able to code a temporal relation without
any attendant temporally-oriented words and morphosyntax. In such instances
the pragmatic context of the adverbial clause would not allow any other
interpretation.
Regarding the adverbial clauses that coded conditional relations, one
tended to find one or more modal morphemes in the corresponding main
clauses. These were irrealis operators (using the terminology of Givén 1990)
which served to point to the hypothetical underpinnings of the conditional
relation. These included modal verbs like uniyiw 'to be necessary, to have
346to, should' or alaqway
may‘would;'can, be able, be possible ', and the modal particleshould; might'. One would also find, quite often, the futuretense prefix sa?-. Other modal operators in the consequent (main) clause

LLatparticle pA 'must be, must have, probably, likely', kalpas 'certainly', and
2inu 'true; surely'. Hortatory particles are included here, such as kume ‘let
it not be (that)...'. Sometimes, also, one would find the main clause having an
imperative verb, or the main clause itself would be a question. Finally, main
clauses in conditional relations were sometimes also found to have a special
particle, kimini 'then, in that case', which only occurs in conditional
relations.
Tense and aspectual morphology was found to be nearly non-existent
in those adverbial clauses that code purpose clauses, with one great exception:
if a purpose clause had any tense/aspect marking, it would have the future
tense prefix sa?-. In fact, for one clause type that codes purposive relations
100% of the time, the Gukanu'so that, in order to' clause type, the onlytense or aspectual morpheme that appears is the future tense prefix sa?-.
Also, 100% of the purpose clause tokens within the na ‘if; when; in order to'
and fehu'because, since, from; in order to'adverbial clause types hadfuture tense marking as well. On the other hand, none of the purpose clauses
were found to have past tense marking. Such patterning makes sense given the
crosslinguistic generalization about purposive relations in Thompson and
Longacre 1985: a purpose clause denotes an event that is unrealized at the
time of the event denoted by the main clause. Hence, events in purpose
clauses are typically future relative to the time of the events coded by the
corresponding main clauses. Future-tense morphology or some other kind of
irrealis marking is thus not unexpected in purpose clauses.
Unlike Barbareno adverbial clauses that code purposive relations,
Barbareno adverbial clauses that code reason relations were rarely found to
have future tense marking. It was not unusual, however, to find past tense
marking in reason clauses. The difference between purpose and reason clauses
with regard to tense patterning is again predicted in Thompson and Longacre
1985: the motivating event coded by a purpose clause has an unrealized status
relative to the main clause event, but the motivating event coded by a reason
clause may indeed already be realized by the time the main clause event
occurs. The event coded by a reason clause, then, can be past relative to the
time of the event coded by its main clause. However, an event coded by a
purpose clause is never past relative to its main clause event; rather, it occurs
in the future relative to the time of its main clause event. Barbareho Chumash
347grammar codes this semantic distinction in that reason clauses may have the
past tense suffix -waS but rarely the future tense prefix sa?-, while purpose
clauses may have the future tense prefix sa?- but never the past tense suffix

"490PREPOSEDPostPosEDTorTALs14272214(66%)(34%)(100%)Table 57. Distribution of temporal clauses by position
This difference in frequency reflects the fact that, in the Barbareno Chumash
narratives, temporal clauses more often than not function in a discourseorganizing capacity. When placed initially, they often work as pivotal points
within the story line. As we have seen in this chapter, most often they help
structure the discourse of narratives involving temporally sequenced events
and situations.
22.2 Final temporal clausesTemporal clauses that occur in final position have two characteristics
in common. First, they do not serve as pivotal points in the structuring of a
discourse. They do not introduce significant portions of the narrative, nor do
they generally make back-references to prior events. Second, they serve mainly
to qualify and narrow the meaning of their main clause through temporal
grounding. These fundamental qualities have been found for final temporal
clauses in English (Ramsay 1987, Ford 1993). They apply equally as well to
final temporal clauses in Barbareno Chumash.
As we saw in Table 57, the majority of temporal clauses in Barbareho
Chumash occur in preposed position. In addition to the two factors cited in
the preceding paragraph, there are several factors that motivate the final
position of a temporal clause. First, a temporal clause that codes a terminal
boundary is more likely to appear postposed than preposed, because it names
an event that occurs last in a given series of events. Second, temporal clauses
that qualify embedded clauses tend to be final. Third, in rarer instances there
are temporal clauses that function as reminders. They close the narrative or
a portion of a narrative by reiterating an underlying theme that runs through
the text. Fourth, nearly a third of postposed temporal clauses have main
clauses that already have preposed material. This material may consist of
topicalized NPs or clauses that serve as a pivotal point of orientation. Finally,
temporal clauses tend to be final if they track discourse participants
491introduced in the main clause. Illustrations for each of these four categories
are given in 22.2.1 through 22.2.5 respectively.
22.2.1 Coding terminal temporal boundaries
In Barbareho Chumash narratives, temporal clauses tend to be final if. they code an event that is the final step in a given process. Exceptions to this
generalization occur only if the temporal clause is, at the same time, creating
a link with a previous event, as through recapitulation. In such cases, then, a
temporal clause that codes a terminal boundary will be preposed, instead of
postposed. As discussed in chapters 4 and 6, Barbareho Chumash codes both
kinds of terminal-boundary temporal clauses with different adverbial
conjunctions: final temporal clauses that code terminal temporal boundaries
always have the adverbial conjunction 2akay hu 'until', but initial temporal
clauses that code terminal temporal boundaries always have the adverbialconjunction mali 'when'.
Three examples of temporal clauses that code terminal boundaries are
given below. (See also chapters 4 and 6 for a detailed treatment of the
semantic and morphosyntactic properties of such clauses.) The excerpts in (25)
and (26) illustrate prototypical, final temporal clauses that code terminal
boundaries. The excerpt in (27) shows a preposed clause that codes this kind
of temporal relation.
The excerpt in (25) is from a procedural text about making posoli. The
temporal clause in question occurs in line e. It names an event in which the
_Skins of the ears of corn finally all come off. This event is the point at which
the main clause action of rubbing the skins (line d.) ceases to occur.

the frog in question is angry (line d.). Only the event in line c. 'they take the
saliva of the frog' falls directly under the scope of the adverbial clause event
in line d. 'when (the frog) is really angry'.
None of the postposed wa 'if; when' clauses have a scope that extends
to more than one preceding main clause. As with the final na 'when' and
maii 'when' adverbial clauses in (2) and (4), the final wa adverbial clause
in line d. below has a dependent syntactic relation that extends only to the
preceding main clause, which is also in line d. That is, the adverbial clause
event 'if he grabs you quickly' applies only to the main clause event '[you
can] jerk yourself loose from him', not the main clause event that occurs in

"289Chapter 13ku ‘lest; so that...not' ClausesThompson and Longacre (1985:188) note that some languages have a
special conjunction for negative purpose clauses. An example in English is the
negative purpose conjunction ‘lest '. In Barbarenho Chumash, that conjunction
is ku 'lest, so that..not'. The Ku adverbial clause type is rare, with only two
tokens in the corpus. Yet, it is worth a brief discussion because it shares some
semantic space with negated Gu 'so that, in order to' purposive clauses
(chapter 11) as well as with haku '‘if' conditional clauses (chapter 7).
The ku conjunction probably has a historical connection with the
conjunction haku 'if', found in conditional and semantically neutral relations.
Adverbial clauses with the conjunctions ku and haku are alike in that both
clause types code unreal, hypothetical situations. But whereas haku clauses
may code a condition, ku clauses code the purpose of the main clause
subject’s action. Specifically with ku clauses, the purpose of the main clause
subject’s action is to avoid an undesirable situation.
It is not entirely clear what the difference in meaning would be for a
purpose clause that has the ku conjunction versus a clause that has the Gu
'so that, in order to' conjunction and the negative prefix e-. In line c. of the
first example below, Mary Yee offered two ways of saying a purposive clause
in which these two conjunctions were contrasted. Harrington noted that these
minimal pairs were ‘carefully contrasted' (59.0586), but he did not state
whether Yee preferred one over the other.

"An extensive taxonomy of adverbial clauses from a cross-linguistic
perspective is given in Thompson and Longacre 1985. Adverbial clause
constructions are defined as 'a set of two-clause constructions in which oneclause can be said to modify the other in a way similar to the way in which anadverb modifies a proposition' (p. 171). This article has two parts. Part I
discusses in detail the types of adverbial clauses found around the world.
These are labeled according to the kinds of semantic relationships that they
signal,
specifically:
circumstantial/means,time,
location,
manner,
purpose,
reason,
simultaneous, conditional, concessive, substitutive,additive, and absolutive. Thompson has since discarded the absolutive
category.’ With each semantic category of adverbial clause, Thompson and
Longacre describe and explain certain structural or morphosyntactic
regularities that one usually finds associated with them. Part I of the study also
highlights similarities between the types of adverbial clauses and other kinds
of syntactic structures, for example juxtaposed clauses, that can convey similar
meanings.
There is also some discussion of borrowed subordinators;
specifically, the factors that lead to one language borrowing an adverbial
clause conjunction from another language. Part II of the Thompson and
Longacre study examines adverbial clauses from a discourse perspective in
monologic texts. It focuses on the ways in which adverbial clauses are relevant
to the structure of paragraphs and of the discourse as a whole. The issues and
questions addressed in Thompson and Longacre 1985, regarding both specific
types of adverbial clauses as well as specific functions, are a useful heuristic
for anyone planning a case study on adverbial clauses.
Chafe 1984 explores how intonation contours and punctuation units
reflect the extent to which an adverbial clause is bound to its main clause, inEnglish written and conversational discourse. If both an adverbial clause and
its main clause occur in the same intonation or punctuation unit, the adverbial
clause is said to be 'bound'. Otherwise, it is said to be 'free'. This study7compares four types of adverbial clauses: preposed clauses that are free,
preposed clauses that are bound; postposed clauses that are free, and
postposed clauses that are bound. A major finding was that adverbial clauses
that are bound are almost always postposed. Chafe explains this tendency
through the theory of Information Flow. The intonation/punctuation unit is the
domain of information flow, with information flowing from the old or familiar
to the new or unfamiliar. When two clauses fall under a single contour, it is
likely that only one of the clauses will convey new or unfamiliar information.
Chafe found that the postposed adverbial clauses contained the new or
unfamiliar information. A second important finding is that free adverbial
clauses are much more common than bound adverbial clauses. Free adverbial
clauses tend to occur initially, however, because they function as 'guideposts'
to information flow, 'signaling a path or orientation in terms of which the
following information is to be understood ' (p. 444). This, according to Chafe,
is probably the prototypical function of adverbial clauses. For the free
adverbial clauses that occur postposed, Chafe found other explanations. Some
were afterthoughts. Other free, postposed adverbial clauses functioned to
modify only the latter part of the preceding main clause, rather than modifying
the entire main clause. This suggests, according to Chafe, that '...the modified
portion of the main clause [is] not even clearly articulated in the speaker’s
mind until the main clause was completed' (p. 447). The findings in Chafe’s
study are incorporated into the issues and questions I address in parts three
and four of this dissertation.
Ford 1993 is an entire monograph devoted to the discourse functions
of adverbial clauses in American English conversation, using the sociological
framework of conversation analysis. Focusing on prosody and interaction
within a conversational context, the author examines the distribution and
discourse functions of temporal, conditional, and causal (reason) adverbial
clauses. There are two main conclusions. The first is that preposed adverbial
clauses play a significant, global role in the structuring of a discourse. The
second is that postposed adverbial clauses have a local role of modifying the
proposition of the preceding main clause, without affecting the overall
organization of the discourse. These conclusions are echoed throughout all of
the literature on adverbial clauses reviewed here, including those studies using
monologic data. Ford’s other findings are that conditional clauses are most
often initial, while temporal and causal (reason) clauses are most often final.
The reasons for these distributions are discussed in terms of factors that are
specific to talk-in-interaction, e.g. the system of turn-taking, problems in
understanding and agreement between speaker and hearer, the need to soften
8assertions, personal motivations, listener prompts, etc. None of these factors
are directly applicable to the data in my Barbareno corpus. However,
throughout the book Ford makes specific predictions or generalizations about
the functions of initial and final temporal, conditional, and causal clauses.
These predictions provide another perspective that has proven useful to my
analyses of the Barbareno data in parts three and four of the dissertation.
Haiman 1978 is a crosslinguistic study of the connection between
conditional clauses and topics. The author finds that, very often among
unrelated languages, conditional clauses and topics resemble each other in
marking and in function. Haiman notes that this similarity is at first surprising,
since topics and conditional clauses are structures that one would not normallythink to be related. Haiman’s discussion follows the premise that similarity in
structure must reflect a similarity in meaning since '...grammars tend to miss
semantic generalizations, rather than to create spurious ones' (p. 565). He
compares traditional definitions of conditional clauses in the philosophical
literature with definitions of 'topic' found in linguistics literature, and finds
that the definitions are similar. Topics and conditional clauses are found to be
unchallengeable and thereby ‘constitute the framework which has been
selected for the following discourse’ (pp. 583,585). In other words, both are
pragmatically presupposed (Givén 1990:830). The main conclusions from this
study are that conditional clauses and topics belong to the same category, and
that conditional clauses are the topics, i.e. givens or presuppositions, of the
sentences in which they occur. As Givén (1990:846) notes, this comparison of
adverbial clauses and topics can only go so far. Prototypical nominal topics
tend to be highly recurrent and important, i.e. anaphoric and cataphoric,
whereas adverbial clauses are rarely recurrent. Still, Haiman’s observations are
relevant to Barbareho data in that many initial adverbial clauses precede the
topic marker 21. This is especially true of those adverbial clauses that express
a conditional relation. The foregoing is the extent of the insight that Haiman
1978 provides for the purposes of my study, however, since his data consist of
sentences constructed in isolation.
Ford and Thompson 1986 is a study of the discourse function of
conditionals in both spoken and written texts. One of the central aims of that
study is to test Haiman’s (1978) proposal that conditionals have the same
function as topics. The authors found that there are several functions that
conditional clauses may have in discourse contexts. Most of these are
associated with conditionals that occur in initial position. Like topics, initial
conditionals serve as a framework of shared information for the following
discourse. First, initial conditionals may be used to repeat claims voiced earlier
9in the discourse. A different, second function is that they may establish
contrasts with information given earlier in the discourse. Or, third, they can be
used to introduce particular cases exemplifying preceding generalizations.
Finally, initial conditionals may also function to offer other options or points
of view that are relevant to those of the preceding discourse. Final
conditionals, unlike initial conditionals, seem to be motivated by factors that
have little to do with the need for a shared frame of reference. For example,
the length of the conditional clause can affect whether it is initial or final;
lengthy ones tend to be final. If the conditional clause is embedded within
another clause then it tends to be postposed, and its scope is limited to the
embedded clause. Also, important or lengthy subjects in the consequent clause
tend to be initial rather than final, which means that the conditional clause hasto be final. Ford and Thompson also found that final conditionals tend to
follow main clauses that express an evaluation or question, though they cannot
explain why this should be so. Final conditional clauses do not play as
important a role in organizing the frame of a discourse as initial conditionals
do; they are not pivotal points in the development of a discourse. One notable
function of final conditionals, however, is that they often function to introduce
afterthoughts or serve as reminders. In conversational texts, conditionals are
used to make polite requests, or otherwise make a given point of view appear
less dogmatic or intrusive. The texts in my Barbareno database are not
conversational texts. Nonetheless, the Ford and Thompson study provides
many insights that have been incorporated into chapter 21 of this dissertation.
Thompson 1985 is a seminal study of the discourse properties of
purpose clauses in written English texts. The author focuses on the different
discourse functions of initial and final purpose clauses. Her main findings are
that initial and final purpose clauses have radically different roles with respect
to the organization of the discourse, even though both types of clauses have
a similar structure:
'...the initial purpose clause functions to state a ""problem"" within
the context of expectations raised by the preceding discourse, to which
the following material (often many clauses) provides a solution, while
the final purpose clause plays the much more local role of stating the
purpose for which the action named in the immediately precedingclause is performed' (p. 55).
Another major finding in Thompson’s study is that the number of initial
purpose clauses is much lower than the number of final purpose clauses.
10Thompson’s insights have been incorporated into my analysis of initial and
final purpose clauses in chapter 20.
Finally, two additional, important sources that inform my analysis are
Haiman and Thompson 1984 and Matthiessen and Thompson 1988. The
former study makes the point that the term ‘subordination' or ‘subordinate
clause' is too broad to be useful in characterizing an adverbial clause, a
complementclause, a relative clause, etc. The latter study, Matthiesen andThompson 1988, is done in a Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) framework.
My dissertation is not written in an RST framework. However, the
Matthiessen and Thompson study is valuable because one of its central aims
is to define and exemplify, explicitly, how adverbial clause combining is
different from other types of clause combining and subordination. For
example, the authors discuss the difference between 'embedding' and ‘clause
combining '. They argue that complement clauses and relative clauses, which
are types of clause embedding, are completely different in kind from adverbial
clauses, which illustrate clause combining. They further discuss the difference
between two types of clause combining: parataxis and hypotaxis. Roughly
speaking, parataxis involves the combining of clauses that are on the same
syntactic level, such as seen in prototypical coordination. Hypotaxis involves
the combining of clauses that are not on the same syntactic level, i.e., one
clause is syntactically dependent on one or more 'main' clauses. Hypotaxis
can be thought of as a more explicit kind of subordination. That is, though a
hypotactic clause is syntactically dependent on a main clause, it is not a clause
that is also a dependent constituent within that main clause, as a subject
complement, object complement, or a relative clause would be. More about
hypotaxis in relation to the definition of the term ‘adverbial clause' is given
in section 1.7.
1.7 TerminologyIn this section I define or characterize terms and concepts that are
especially relevant to my analysis of adverbial clauses in Barbareho Chumash.
I begin with the concept of ADVERBIAL CLAUsE. Following that I give definitions
for terms traditionally used to denote the semantic relation of an adverbial
clause to its main clause(s): TEMPORAL, CONDITIONAL, CONCESSIVE, REASON,
PURPOSIVE, and MANNER. Another kind of semantic relation distinguised in this
dissertation is the semantically NEUTRAL relation. These semantic relations are
defined in a general way in this section, but they will be further defined and
discussed in terms of criteria specific to the Barbareno language in section
1.9.2.
11My general characterization of a prototypical adverbial clause is as
follows. First, an adverbial clause exists in a hypotactically dependent
relationship with one or more clauses. A HyPOTACTIC CLAUSE is one that is
dependent on a main clause but which is not embedded in the main clause.
As noted in Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, hypotactic dependence is an
important feature that distinguishes adverbial clauses from other kinds of
subordinate clauses, such as object- or subject complements and restrictive
relative clauses, which are embedded in their main clause. Thus a complement
clause is either a subject or object argument of a main clause verb, but an
adverbial clause is never an argument. A restrictive relative clause is a
constituent that makes up part of a larger noun phrase, but an adverbial
clause never serves as a constituent of a noun phrase.
Second, unlike other kinds of hypotactically dependent clauses, such as
non-restrictive relative clauses and clauses of reported speech (the latter is not
to be confused with clauses of quoted speech), an adverbial clause can
normally appear before or after the main clause without a change in meaning.
Finally, as traditionally defined for two-clause constructions, an adverbial
clause is one that modifies another clause or sentence. As seen in the
literature review section, however, sentential modification does not begin todescribe the kinds of functions an adverbial clause may have.
A PREPOSED or initial adverbial clause is one that occurs before its main
clause. A postroseEp or final adverbial clause is one that follows its main clause.
Following now are general definitions and characterizations I use for
the traditional terms that denote the semantic relation between an adverbial
clause and its main clause. These definitions and characterizations are
extrapolated from discussions in Thompson and Longacre 1985, Matthiessen
and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990 and Ford 1993. A Tempora_ relation is one
in which the event named by the main clause is anchored to the time of the
event named by the adverbial clause. In a conpiTIonaL relation, the adverbial
clause provides the condition(s) under which the event named by the main
clause holds. Sometimes the semantic relation is conflated with respect to
conditionality and time. I refer to such relations and the adverbial clauses that
code them as NEUTRAL. In a concsssive relation, the adverbial clause expresses
a situation that, from the narrator’s or protagonist’s point of view, would
‘under normal circumstances detract from or mitigate the situation expressed
in the main clause. Or, as Thompson and Longacre (1985:198) state, it ""makes
a concession against which the proposition in the main clause is contrasted.""
In a purpose relation, the adverbial clause provides a purpose for which the
event in the main clause is undertaken. Importantly however, as noted in
12Thompson and Longacre 1985:185, the situation expressed in the adverbial
clause must be unrealized at the time of the event expressed in the main
clause. This restriction is a crucial difference between purpose and REASON
relations. In the latter, the situation in the adverbial clause is the reason forthe situation that obtains in the main clause, and it may already be realized
by the time the situation expressed by the main clause has occurred. Finally,
in a MANNER relation, the adverbial clause specifies the manner in which the
action or event of the main clause occurs.
The foregoing are non-language-specific definitions for the semantic
categories of adverbial clauses analyzed in this dissertation. In section 1.9.2 I
discuss the methodology I use to determine which Barbareho adverbial clauses
have which of the semantic relations discussed above.
1.8 DatabaseAlmost all of the data that I have used for this dissertation come from
microfilm reel #59 of the Harrington corpus, which is outlined in Mills and
Brickfield 1986. This reel consists mostly of 243 narrative texts from Mary
Yee. I have provided an interlinear, morpheme-by-morpheme gloss for all of
these texts, which vary in length from about half of a printed page to fifteen
printed pages including the free translation. Of the 243 texts in reel #59, 205
were found to contain adverbial clauses. Examples of narratives from reel #59
include procedural or ‘how to' texts, personal family experiences,
ethnographic accounts, and tales about legendary sorcerers and other
magically powerful people. It should be noted that there are several more
microfilm reels of data from Mary Yee, and that my data are taken from
roughly 25% of the total corpus of texts and notes that Harrington recorded
from Yee.
Of the data from Beeler’s corpus, I used one of the myth texts he
recorded from Mary Yee (Beeler and Whistler 1980). This published text is
four pages long, with detailed commentary given in footnotes. This text was
found to have adverbial clauses, bringing to a total of 206 the number of
narrative texts in my analyzed corpus in which I was able to find adverbial
clauses.
The total number of adverbial clauses in the corpus is 567. In the
summary to part two I summarize the distributions of these clauses with
regard to structural type, semantic relation, and position.","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]"

main clause. It continues tracking the referent Lucrecia, first introduced in line
b. The temporal clause has to be postposed because, if it were preposed, the
third person subject prefix s- (in the temporal clause) would be referring to
Florentino, the topicalized NP in line a., instead of Lucrecia, the object NP inline b. (It will be recalled that pronouns in Chumash languages do not
distinguish gender.) Thus if the order of the adverbial clause were changed,
the meaning would change to:

purpose clauses in Barbareho Chumash generally function to state a problem

form a procedure for achieving the goal named in the initial purpose clause.
Hence, initial purpose clauses tend to be found in procedural texts, or in
stretches of speech that describe a sequence of steps for accomplishing a given
goal.
The excerpt in (1) describes the procedure for making a kind of homemade candle, calleda candil, which the Chumash began to use soon afterthe Spanish came to their land. The context preceding the initial purpose
clause is given in line a. We learn that there was a type of tallow candle
available for purchase, but it was a kind of candle that was not economical to
use. The Chumash used a more economical, home-made alternative called thecandil. Thus in the preceding context there arises the expectation and
assumption that there was a need for the candil, and that there must have
been a way for the Chumash to make it. The initial purpose clause in line b.
expresses the problem, 'To make a candil...', and serves as a link between
the preceding context in line a. and the sequence of events in lines c. through

<like yow’re not at all afraid to steal.>As noted in chapter 16, these tokens are unlike the rest of the kaheé
‘like, as if' clauses in two respects. First, the main clause and the kaheéclause each code a manner that is exactly the same. In (13), the ocean 'goes'
or 'makes its way' exactly the same way in which it 'laps'; in (14),
marijuana affects you or 'makes' you such that you are not afraid to steal.
Second, the meaning of the main clause would be incomplete without the
attending kaneé clause. Hence, the dependent marker hi= indexes a tighter
cohesiveness between the main clause and the kanheé clause than is normally
found in this clause type.
18.3 Summary
The presence of the dependent marker hi= on final clauses is iconic
with the crosslinguistic generalization that a final adverbial clause has a tighter
semantic bond with its main clause than an initial adverbial clause has with its
main clause. The table on the following page gives an overall summary of the

Differences in the Prosodic/PunctuationBoundaryIn studies done mostly on English adverbial clauses, it has been found
that initial adverbial clauses are more likely than final clauses to be separated
from the corresponding main clause by a prosodic boundary or pause in
spoken speech, or by some form of punctuation (such as a comma) in written
language (Chafe 1984, Thompson 1985, Quirk et al. 1985, Ramsay 1987, Givén
1990:847). The extent to which there is a boundary or pause corresponds with
the extent to which the dependent clause is conceptually bound to its
associated modified material. Furthermore, the degree of conceptual
connectedness varies depending upon the kind of semantic relation coded by
the adverbial clause. For example, Ford (1992, 1993) found that final temporal
clauses are most likely not to be separated from the preceding, associated
clause by a prosodic boundary in spoken speech, or by punctuation in written
speech. Final reason clauses, however, are more likely to be separated from
the preceding, associated material by a prosodic boundary or by a punctuation
mark. This difference in the presence/absence of a prosodic/punctuation
boundary relates to the difference in the degree to which the adverbial clause
is conceptually dependent upon its preceding, associated material (Ford 1992,1993; see also Hengeveld 1998:347).!
In this chapter we will explore how Harrington used punctuation in his
transcriptions of adverbial clause constructions in Mary Yee’s Barbareno
Chumash narratives. Working from the assumption that punctuation marks
such as a comma and period indicate a pause, we will explore the extent to
which the punctuation marks in Harrington’s transcription show any patterns
and, if they do, we will see to what extent they reflect the patterns of
punctuation and prosodic boundaries reported in other studies of adverbial
clauses.
It is first of all an interesting question whether the punctuation in
Harrington’s transcription really does reflect prosodic boundaries in Mary
Yee’s speech as she was dictating the narratives to him. There is an inevitable
obscuring of prosodic boundaries when texts are dictated, and even more so
when the stories that are dictated are ones that have been handed down
through the generations. A philological study of Harrington’s transcription
revealed that he was meticulous in noting pauses or hiatuses between
374morphemes, by using a hyphen (Wash 1997). He did not appear to be as
meticulous in noting pauses at the more macro, discourse level. However, an
examination of Harrington’s punctuation in adverbial clause constructions
reveals some systematic usage. An overall tabulation of punctuation for the
preposed and postposed adverbial clauses from chapters 4 - 16 is given in
Table 42. Slightly over half (58%) of the initial clauses are followed by
punctuation, but a greater percentage of final clauses (62%) have no
intervening punctuation after their main clause.","[393, 394, 395, 396, 397]"

in my corpus, neutral clauses more often than not serve a global role in the
structuring of a discourse.
23.2 Final neutral clausesFinal neutral clauses do not perform any of the kinds of discoursestructuring tasks we saw with initial neutral clauses. Rather, like the other
537kinds of final adverbial clauses we have seen in part four of this dissertation,
their only task is to qualify the meaning of the main clause proposition. In
addition to the fact that these neutral clauses serve only to qualify the
meaning of ththe main clause, there are two factors in particular that influence
the likelihood that a neutral clause will be final: referent tracking and main
clauses that are embedded. These two factors are discussed and illustrated in
23.2.1 and 23.2.2 respectively. Other neutral clauses appear to be final for
other reasons: i) the main clause may already have preposed, associated
material; ii) the neutral clause is anafterthought or reminder; or, iii) theneutral clause occurs in a routinized construction. These are illustrated in
23.2.3. A brief summary is given in 23.2.4.
23.2.1 Referent trackingMost neutral clauses occur in final position for reasons that have to do
with the demands of referent tracking. There are two prominent patterns in
the data, these are explored in 23.2.1.1 and 23.2.1.2 respectively. In the first
pattern, the main clause predicates something about a referent expressed in
the immediately preceding material. The main clause provides a comment or
an evaluation, while the neutral clause provides further information about the
meaning of the proposition in the main clause. In most instances, the referent
in question is a statement about habitually-occurring events, past or present.
In the second pattern, the main clause introduces a full NP whose referent has
a role as a Given core argument in the neutral clause. Both scenarios allow
for easier cognitive processing, in that the main clause and the adverbial
clause immediately follow the material which is most relevant to the meanings
of their propositions, and about which they comment on further.
23.2.1.1 Referent tracking in the main clause
In this category of final neutral clauses, the main clause is often
preceded by some sort of generic statement about how things are done or
used to be done long ago. The idea embodied in that preceding statement is
then tracked in the main clause as an unmarked third person subject, with the
predicate beginning with the stative prefix 2?al- instead of the third
pronominal prefix s-. The proposition in the main clause is either a comment
or an evaluation about the preceding material, and the final neutral clause
follows with further information that qualifies the main clause.
The first illustration of this pattern is seen in (23). This text is about a
traditional remedy for relieving the effects of poison oak. The first three lines
refer to the main ingredient of the poison oak remedy and what process was
538applied to it before putting it to use on the afflicted person. The neutral
clause construction begins in line d., with the main clause expressing an
evaluation about the remedy: ' it is good for one to cure with it'. The neutral

<They smear with it on the place where you are afflicted with poison oak.>Though Mary Yee could have possibly uttered the neutral clause
construction in the reverse order, with the adverbial clause preposed instead
of postposed, such an order would not be as felicitous as what we see in the
actual text above. The reason has to do with relevance of meaning and ease
of cognitive processing. The main clause in line d. above expresses an
539evaluation about the idea referred to in the material that immediately
precedes it (lines a. - c.). In this way, the material in lines a. - c. is closely tied
to the proposition of the main clause in line d. Since the proposition of the
adverbial clause is rclevaiit Only to its Main Clause proposition, it is more
felicitous for the adverbial clause to follow its main clause instead of coming
between its main clause and the material to which its main clause refers.
The short text in (24) illustrates a similar scenario. Line a. expresses
the idea that people used to drink sea water. This idea is then commented on
in the main clause of the neutral construction (line b.), 'This was a remedy’.
Two conjoined neutral adverbial clauses follow this main clause, in lines c. and
d. They give information about what the remedy is for.

ConditionalClauses21.0 Introduction
Like initial and final purpose clauses, initial and final conditional
clauses have different functions within a discourse context. (See especially
Ford and Thompson 1986, Ford 1993 and Ramsey 1987 for conditional clauses
in English discourse, and Marchese 1987 for conditional clauses in Godié
procedural discourse.) My approach to understanding the discourse functions
of conditional clauses in Barbareho Chumash oral narratives owes much in
particular to the insights of the Ford & Thompson 1986 and Ford 1993
studies.
As is true with initial adverbial clauses in general, initial conditional
clauses in Barbareno Chumash have a more global role than final conditional
clauses, in discourse. Both initial and final conditional clauses serve to qualify
the meaning of the associated main clause, but initial conditional clauses in
Barbareho do several kinds of discourse-management work that final
conditional clauses do not do: i) they may develop a discourse by introducing
options or alternatives; ii) they may establish contrasts with information given
earlier in the discourse; iii) they may repeat claims that were mentioned
earlier in the discourse; iv) they may give a particular example of a
generalization given earlier in the discourse; and finally, v) they may establish
a background setting, often at or near the beginning of a narrative.
Final conditional clauses in Barbareho are restricted in function to
qualifying the proposition expressed in its main clause. They do not create
discourse-level links as their initial counterparts do.
Conditional clauses in Barbareho have an overwhelming tendency to
function in the more global, discourse-organizing capacity. This functional bias
is reflected in the distribution of conditional clauses, in that 86% of the tokensare preposed. The reason for this preference in function is that the inherent,
hypothetical meaning of a conditional clause lends itself well to the creation
of temporary discourse worlds or realities (Ford 1993), which then provide a
framework for contextualizing the information in the propositions that follow.
This chapter is organized as follows. Preposed conditional clauses are
discussed in 21.1, followed by postposed conditional clauses in 21.2. A
summary closes the chapter in 21.3.

of several functions: exploring options, establishing contrasts, repeating earlier
claims.

setting. These are ways in which initial conditional clauses manage the flow of

the discourse. Table 53 summarizes the number and percentage of initial
conditional clause tokens with respect to discourse function.","[444, 445, 446]"
"I have been privileged to know and count as friends many of the past
and present graduate students in the department of linguistics at UCSB. I
have learned much from them, and am grateful for the pillars of moral
Support that they have been during the years of my graduate study.
I wish to thank the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History for
kindly providing the microfilms of J. P. Harrington’s manuscript materials as
well as Madison Beeler’s original manuscripts, thereby making this study
possible.
.
My earlier research on Barbareho Chumash was funded by gran
BNS90-11018 from the National Science Foundation (Marianne Mithun,
principal investigator). My M.A. thesis was part of that earlier research. I want
to thank Graeme Langley, whose moral support helped me get through that
very difficult time and move on to the next phase of my graduate study.
I am grateful for the heip and kind words i have received over the
years from Leanne Hinton, Martha Macri, Catherine Callaghan, Robert
Oswalt, Sally McLendon, Victor Golla and Margaret Langdon. Their belief in
the worth of my work on Miwok and Chumash languages has helped me find
the strength and resolve to continue doing it.
Of all my teachers and mentors I am especially indebted to Mr.
Domingo Ramirez, who was my 9th grade social studies teacher at SequoiaJunior High School. He apparently felt that I needed a greater challenge, so
he arranged for me to be put into classes for gifted/talented students when I
entered high school. Thanks to his initiative, I was put into the company of
kids who had high expectations for their futures, kids who not only took it for
granted that they would go to a four-year university, but that they would also
go on to earn doctoral degrees. That environment greatly expanded my view
of what I could do and be in this world. It was a precious gift for which I am
forever grateful.
Finally, I would like to express my thanks to some truly special people
in my life, people whose love, friendship, and support continue to make all the
difference in the world:To my parents, for believing in me and in my dreams. I thank them
also for the financial help and other material support they have generously
given during my years of graduate study.
To my sister and brother-in-law, for always wishing me well. I am also
grateful for their kids, whose entrance into this world has added a precious
dimension to my life.
To my boyfriend, Lawrence Morgan, for being extraordinarily loving
and supportive in countless ways.
To Steven Fincke, Robert Englebretson, Elisa Kamimoto, and Mary &Vern LeFever, for their priceless friendship and moral support over the
years.
Lastly, I give deepest thanks to God for all that I have and for all that
I am able to accomplish, including finally finishing this dissertation. ©VITA

Adverbial Clauses in BarbarehoChumash Narrative DiscourseBy
Suzanne WashThis dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareno Chumash, an indigenous language of California. It explores the
semantic relations, morphosyntactic structure, and discourse functions of
adverbial clauses in this language, with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses crosslinguistically, and from a functionallyoriented approach to linguistics. Almost all of the data come from narratives
recorded in the 1950s by John Harrington from Mary Yee, the last speaker of
the Barbareho Chumash language.
The dissertation is divided into five parts. Part I is the preliminaries. It
includes a detailed grammatical sketch of the Barbareno Chumash language.
In Part II I analyze the semantic and morphosyntactic characteristics of
thirteen structurally-distinguishable adverbial clause types. The adverbial
clausescodetemporal,conditional,concessive,purposive,reason/causal,manner, and semantically neutral relations. Semantically neutral adverbial
clauses have both temporal and conditional meanings, and though most
researchers treat such clauses as conditional, in this study I treat them as a
category separate from the temporal and conditional categories. In Part TI I
compare the initial and final tokens of these clause types with respect to
similaritiesanddifferencesinstructure,extentofscope,andpunctuation/prosodic boundaries. In Part IV I focus on the similarities and
differences in discourse functions between initial and final clauses that code
purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral relations. In addition
to their qualifying role, the initial adverbial clauses function as pivotal points
of orientation that help create a cohesive and coherent text. However, the
final adverbial clauses only serve to qualify the main clause. They do not
function as pivotal points of orientation in a discourse. These differences
between initial and final adverbial clauses are found crosslinguistically, and
reflect the general cognitive processes involved in the production and
comprehension of discourse (Giv6n 1995). Finally, I conclude this study withthe closing remarks in Part V.,

Introduction1.1 Purpose of this studyThis dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareho Chumash, an indigenous language of California. The goals of the
dissertation are two-fold. First, it describes what adverbial clauses look like in
this language, sorting them into types that correspond to certain structural
criteria. Second, it explores discourse-functional explanations for the ways in
which the adverbial clauses pattern as they do in Barbareho Chumash
narratives. Both of these goals are met with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses cross-linguistically, in both their grammatical
and discourse-functional properties.
Much has been published on adverbial clauses. Almost all studies on
adverbial clauses, however, use constructed sentences for data. Relatively few
studies have examined adverbial clauses within the context of non-constructed,connected discourse, such as monologic narratives and conversation. This
dissertation not only examines adverbial clauses from a discourse context, but
it also provides a rare, in-depth look at adverbial clauses in an American
Indian language. For the reasons cited above, this study aims to be a worthy
contribution to the cross-linguistic literature on adverbial clauses and, more
generally, to discourse-functional perspectives on language.
1.2 Geographic and linguistic affiliation of the Barbareno Chumash language
Barbareno belongs to the Chumashan family of languages. The original
territory of the Chumash people extends along the California coast from a
little beyond San Luis Obispo in the north down to Malibu in the south. It
extends inland, bordering the San Joaquin valley. It also includes the Santa
Barbara Channel Islands, three of which were inhabited year around: Santa
Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel. The Barbareho language itself was spoken
in the present-day Santa Barbara county, roughly in an area from Refugio
Beach to Carpinteria. The last known speaker of Barbareho was Mary Yee,
who died in 1965.
The word Chumash originates from ehumas ‘islander', a term used
by mainlanders. However, if the word &uma is derived from the same root
as the Barbareno word 2anéum ‘money; shell bead money', as I believe
2it is,’ then the original meaning of the word éhumas has more to do with the
fact that the islanders were the producers of money. The ancestors of the
present-day Chumash had a market economy long before the Europeans
arrived, They used precisely-measured strings of shell-bead money as their
currency. The islanders produced this currency for export and trade to the
mainland. The islands of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel were mints
in the literal sense of the word. See King 1976, Hudson & Blackburn 1986 and
Arnold 1987 for detailed information on this subject.
Chumashan has two major branches with at least six languages. Earlier
classifications were later refined in Klar 1973, 1977, 1981, and Mithun 1999,Known dialectal divisions are given in parentheses.

Island Chumash [also referred to as Ysleno]: (Cruzeho, Roseho, Migueleho)
Most of the names for the Chumash languages are derived from the
names of the mission communities in which their speakers lived: Obispeno,
fromMissionSanLuisObispo;Purisimeno,fromMissionLaPurisimaConcepcién; Ineseho or Ynesefio, from Mission Santa Ynez; Barbareho, from
Mission Santa Barbara; and Ventureho, from Mission San Buenaventura. The
name of the sixth member of Chumashan, IslandChumash, comes from thefact that its three dialects were spoken by people who lived on the Santa
Barbara Channel Islands: Cruzenho, from Santa Cruz Island; Roseho, from
Santa Rosa Island; and Migueleno, from San Miguel Island.
Much remains to be understood about the dialectal divisions within
each Chumash language. Until all of Harrington’s notes are thoroughly
analyzed, definite conclusions about the dialectal differences within each of the
Chumash languages will have to wait.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"

clauses: a same-subject Gukanu clause in g. and a different-subject Cukanu
clause in h. The same-subject clause in g. did not retain the subject pronoun
s~, but the pronoun for the different-subject clause in h. is retained. The
reason again has to do with whether or not the main clause subject has
control. As has been pointed out, those who wear the bear claw talisman can
become strong, at will, by using the bear claw talisman. The same-subject
éukanu clause in g. reflects this control by the suppression of the subject
pronoun. The ones who wear the bear claw talisman do not, however, havecontrol over whether people have respect for them or hold them in high
esteem. The different-subject adverbial clause reflects this by retaining the
third person subject pronoun s-. Possibly a very strong person could threaten
others and thereby force them to act respectfully. If such were the case, one
would expect that the subject pronoun s~ would not be retained in the
adverbial clause. That is, one would expect to see *?amsa?2suku instead of
the attested samsa?suku in line h.
Another instance in which the main clause subject does not have full
control is given in (10). The example is from a narrative about a man who
wanted to give the appearance of having many lovers. Though the main clause
subject has control over how much he scratches himself up (=the main clause
event), he does not have control over the extent to which the scratches make
him look, in the eyes of others, to be the favorite of women (= adverbial
clause event). In fact, the point of the story is the humorous irony that, in
spite of his efforts, he did not fool anyone; everyone instead thought that he
was simply half crazy. The main clause in question is a relative clause with the
meaning 'who used to scratch himself up'. The Head NP, hi=1=2ihiy ‘a
man', has a grammatical role of subject in its relative clause. The referent is
indexed on the verb 'scratch up oneself' with the third person subject prefix
s-. The different-subject Gukanu adverbial clause 'so that it would appear
they (women) like him very much' has pronominal marking with the third
person s— on the verb uxwal 'to resemble, to appear'.

<so that it would appear they (women) like him very much.>The verb uxwal ‘appear, resemble ' retains the third person subject pronoun
(a ""dummy"" subject with the meaning ‘it'), because the main clause subject
cannot successfully manipulate the adverbial clause event. It is his purpose to
look like he has been with a lot of women, but in actuality he is not able to
achieve this aim. If the dummy subject pronoun were lacking in the above
adverbial clause, the [s] in the future tense prefix sa2- would not be
aspirated, and the result would be *Gukanu=sa?-uxwal.
The main clause subject in (11) likewise does not have full control, and
so the adverbial clause subject pronoun is not suppressed. The main clause
subject (line b.) is an indefinite human, coded with the impersonal subject sam- in the verb phrase 2al-&%o hi=s-am-hik ‘it was good that they
put...'. The adverbial clause subject (line c.) is a cut on a horse, and is coded
with the third person subject s-. (This pronoun is phonetically merged with
the initial [s] of the future tense prefix sa2~-, resulting in aspiration on the
[s].) The goal of the main clause subject is to help the horse’s cut heal as
quickly as possible. Of course, the main clause subject cannot fully control how
quickly the cut will heal. The grammar reflects this lack of control by the fact
that the adverbial clause subject pronoun is not suppressed.

<so that it would heal promptly.>The semantics of control and its effect on pronominal retention is
especially clear when the adverbial clause subject is an inanimate object. In
example (1), reintroduced as (12) below, the adverbial clause subject is lard
that is inside a can. The human subject of the main clause is able to prevent
the lard from catching on fire by making sure that the wick is long enough.
The main clause subject thus has full control, and this is reflected by the fact
that the adverbial clause third person subject pronoun s- is suppressed.

"<Long ago, the locks and keys were big.> At the Presidio and at the Old Missionthey had the big locks and keys.’One cannot literally lock a door by simply saying ""I am going to use a key"".
Thus the initial purpose clause in line b. above does not express a literal
purpose. Rather, it functions as a link between the implicit expectation set up
in line a. and the propositions expressed in lines c. and d. In line a., we learn
that the Barbareho people used words borrowed from Spanish when talking
about locks, keys, and any activity associated with locks and keys. The
propositions in lines c. and d. give the solution, in the form of an example of
how the Barbareno people actually used Spanish when talking about locking
up. (The word yawe 'key' in line d. is a borrowing from Spanish.) As
Thompson notes, non-literal purpose clauses in English are never found in
postposed position. The same is true for Barbareno Chumash. The reason
again is that the non-literal purpose clause is functioning as a link between
implicit expectations or needs set up in the preceding discourse and the
‘solution that follows. Purpose clauses in final position do not perform this
role.
Initial purpose clauses that help establish a chain of sequential events
always have a global, discourse-organizing role. Not all initial purpose clauses
have this function, however. One function not noted in Thompson’s study, but
one which is relevant to Barbareno, is that an initial purpose clause may name
an option that contrasts with another option given in the preceding context.
Such contrasts can be local. The initial purpose clause in that case may have
a scope of only one main clause. For example, the initial purpose clause in
(9), line d., has a much more local than global role within the discourse, and411does not appear to serve as a link between a given set of expectations or
needs and a solution.a.","[433, 434]"

is no case marking on nouns. Grammatical relations show a nominativeaccusative pattern. There are no canonical adpositions or adjectives. There is
significant prefixing on both verbs and nouns. Suffixation does occur, but not
to the same extent. The basic morphological structure of the verb and noun
is covered in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 respectively.
2.2.1The verb
.
The Barbareho Chumash verb is polymorphemic. The core of the verb
is the verb stem, which is usually a combination of morphemes fused together
over time. (See section 2.2.1.6.) The stem usually has several prefixes and
suffixes. Figure 1 shows the overall configuration of the Barbarenho Chumash
verb. The affixes toward the top of each column are inflectional and occur
furthest out from the stem, while those closer to the bottom are more
derivational and often form part of the stem itself.

41OF SUFFIXES2.2.1.1Person and number
Pronominal affixes show a nominative-accusative pattern. As Ono
(1996) has argued, these affixes are truly referential pronouns. They should
not be thought of as agreement markers, which serve only to copy certain
features of independent NPs. An utterance can be complete with just the verb
and its affixes, because the pronominal affixes already indicate who or what
is being talked about.
The prefixes index the subject of the verb, distinguishing three persons
(first, second, and third person) and four numbers (singular, dual, plural, and
indefinite or unspecified). Table 5 lists the subject pronominal prefixes.

Pronominal suffixes index the object of the verb if the object is first
person, second person, or non-singular third person. The object suffixes do not
distinguish dual and plural. Singular third person objects are not indexed onthe verb.! Table 6 lists the object suffixes.

Emphatic glottalization is often encliticized onto the final syllable, and an
epenthetic /?/ begins the word if it is otherwise vowel initial. The imperative
form of kutiy takes a slightly different form when its meaning includes a
third singular object. In such cases it ends with /l/ instead of /y/.

semantic agents or patients, or appear in transitive or intransitive clauses. This
fact is illustrated below with the third person subject pronoun, s-. In (119),
the subject is a semantic agent, 'a dog', that eats eggs.

is indicated with the prefix sa2-. The past tense is formally marked with the
suffix ~waS. In Barbareho Chumash these tenses are relative (Mithun 1996,
1999). Thus the reference pointto a future time or a past time can be either
the moment of speech or a time under discussion, as in a narrative time line.
Below are some examples of future tense and past tense marking.
