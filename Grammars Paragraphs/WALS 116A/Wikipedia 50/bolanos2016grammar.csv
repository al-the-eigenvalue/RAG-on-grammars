Question-word interrogative clauses elicit specific information (as opposed to
‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers sought in polar questions). Content questions are formed by
using the relevant question word (the question word can occassionally be omitted,
see below). A list of interrogative words (discussed in Chapter 7) is given in Table
12.3. These interrogative words are derived from the interrogative stem de- (see
Chapter 7 for an extensive description of interrogative pronouns and other question
words).

example, is inferred by speakers based on context.

Content questions are typically answered with a (declarative) clause, or with
a single word that provides the particular information solicited.
Polar (yes-no) questions can be responded to positively in two ways: with the
̃̂ ‘yes, aha’ (84)-(85) or by repeating in a declarative form the
affirmative particle hɨhɨ
verb phrase that appeared in the interrogative (86)-(87). Subjects are frequently
dropped, as in (84) and (86).

Kakua does not have a dedicated ‘no’ particle. The negative existentialwîʔikan serves as an expression of clausal negation. Alternatively, negation can also
be expressed by the verbal suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’ (for verbal negation).
Either of these two can be used when responding negatively to a question. A
negative response to a polar question can be done by repeating the predicate of the
interrogative clause and adding the negation suffix -kan/-kap (88), or with the clausalBasic clause structure and types of clauses335negative expression wîʔikan (89). A negative response to a content question can
include the expression of negation wîʔikan (89):

interrogative clauses. Content interrogative clauses demand a full declarative clause
as a response, or just an NP.
12.11 Imperative clauses
Imperative clauses in Kakua are formed by reduplication of the last vowel of
the verb root of the predicate of the imperative clause. The reduplicated vowel
receives an obligatory high tone. The imperative suffix is then by default represented
as -Ṽ́ , where the quality of the vowel is the same as that of the last vowel of the
verb root. This is illustrated in examples (90)-(105):
90) ɲi=tɨ ̀j-huj-ú
2PL=be.good-listen-IMP
‘listen carefully!’

eat-IMP
‘eat!’336A Grammar of Kakua92) wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-á=buhú
1SG=OBJ tell-IMP=DIR
‘tell me’5
Like all Kakua clauses, imperative clauses in Kakua are typically verb-final.
Kakua often omits the overt expression of subject NP arguments (although their overt
expression is considered acceptable by speakers, they judge them to be redundant),
for they are usually referred to by means of cross-referencing proclitics on the verb
predicate. Imperative clauses in Kakua tend to omit the subject argument of the
clause more often than other clauses (a cross-linguistic common characteristic of
imperative clauses; c.f., Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171; Aikhenvald 2010:92-97, and
Chapter 2 of the same book). The omission of the subject argument of the clause
occurs more frequently with 2SG forms than with 2PL forms; however, this omission
can be said to be facultative, since instances of the 2PL where the subject argument
is omitted can also occur when context is sufficient to allow for it. The verb root
plus the imperative marker -Ṽ́, without need of further affixes or clitics, can function
as an imperative clause by itself (also a cross-linguistically common feature of
imperative clauses Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171). If additional TAME distinctions
occur, they form a separate clause. Imperative clauses without an overt proclitic are
interpreted by default as having a second person singular subject (93)-(94). Examples
(95) and (96) illustrate imperatives with overt 2PL and 2SG proclitic pronouns
respectively:
93) fwɨb-ɨ ̃́

As seen in this section, Kakua interrogative pronouns and question words are
built on a basic de- form. Semantically, both interrogative pronouns and question
words can be considered to fall into one class of interrogative words. Functionally,
however, these words form two different sets: the set of interrogative words that
have pronominal function, and the set of interrogative words with adverbial
functions.","[238, 239, 240]"

construction seems to serve a function of making the command more ‘soft’, or more
polite:

As seen in (110) above, constituent order in negative imperatives clauses is
typically verb final; and whenever both the subject and object are overtly expressed
through a lexical noun or free pronoun, the order of subject and object is inverted
from the typical SOV basic order in Kakua, resulting in OSV (although speakers
accept other orders). The change of the preferred order into an OSV order is typical
for imperative clauses cross-linguistically (c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97).
12.13 Responding to imperatives
Responses to imperative clauses are constructed like responses to questions
(described in §12.10 above under interrogative polar and content questions).
̃̂ ‘yes’, or
Commands are usually responded to with the particle (interjection) hɨhɨ
another particle with affirmative meaning (see Chapter 3 for a list of particles and
interjections in Kakua), such as da! ‘thereǃ’, among others. Additionally (as with
questions), imperatives can be responded to by repeating the predicate of the
imperative clause in a declarative construction. Example in (111) below illustrates a
response to a command:Basic clause structure and types of clauses341waj-kan=héʔ

12.14 Summary
This chapter describes the basic clause structure in Kakua. A minimal clause
contains at least one predicate. Given that cross-referencing proclitics can stand for
the subject NP of the clause, the overt expression of the subject NP is not obligatory
in order to form a clause. In basic clauses involving predicates with semantically
transitive verb roots, the object argument NP generally precedes the predicate of the
clause. Most other clause types also prefer the basic SOV order of constituents. An
exception to this is the imperative clause, which prefers an OSV order.
The basic clause structures of copula constructions (affirmative and negative
copular clauses), predicative possessive clauses, comparatives, verbless clauses, and
basic locative clauses were described in sections §12.2 to §12.7 respectively. It was
also shown that nonverbal clauses represent a common strategy in Kakua to express
equative copular meanings.
This chapter ended with a description of the structure and coding of
declarative, interrogative and imperative (both affirmative and negative) clauses in
§12.10 and §12.11. Kakua declarative clauses represent the default type of clause.
Additionally, there is a morpheme which expresses an imperative mood for
when the request is to perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The origin
of this morpheme is obscure, and a diachronic explanation is still to be found in
order to have a more accurate approach to analyze the form. Future research,342A Grammar of Kakuaincluding perhaps a comparative analysis between Kakua, Nɨkak and other
neighboring languages, will undoubtedly presents us with fascinating hypotheses on
the origin of this form.","[360, 361, 362, 363]"
"10.4.2 Interrogative mood =nit
The interrogative marker in Kakua serves to express questions (polar
questions, see Chapter 12 section §12.10 for the description of polar and content
questions). An interrogative implies a “non-assertion” (see Palmer 2001:52-53), and
as a type of illocution, it represents an ‘unqualified question’ without necessarily
implying the speaker’s commitment, attitudes or even expectations towards the
answer. The interrogative marker is mutually exclusive with declarative and
imperative illocution markers.
The interrogative marker in Kakua is the clitic =nit ‘INTER’, and although its
most common host is the predicate (verb; as in Table 10.3 above), as in example
(53), the interrogative marker can also attach to other parts of speech such as
pronouns (54), nominalized or adjectivized verbs (55), or NPs (56):

‘you Parakeets were there, (were you all the same) group?’Taking into account that a quotation in Kakua can also be expressed as a reported situation, I
do not undertake here a discussion of the differences between quotative and reportative evidentiality,
given that there is no distinction between these two in Kakua.
9286A Grammar of KakuaThe interrogative illocution can be combined with other modality markers,
like the dubitative, as in the following example.10
57) ma=beh-hin-kan=nit
2SG=go-DUB-NEG=INTERR
‘aren’t you going?’
Unlike declaratives, the interrogative marker can occur in clauses marked with
inferred evidentiality:
58) měm
ma=ta-naʔa-beh=ta=nit
2SG
2SG=EVID-want-go=INF.EVID=INTERR
‘maybe you want to go?’
Interrogative clauses, and how responses to them are formed, are further
described in Chapter Section §12.10.
10.4.3 Imperative mood: –Ṽ́ ‘IMP’, -kabuhú ‘NEG.IMP’, and -ʔabuhú ‘IMP2’
The last category of illocution is the imperative mood. The imperative mood
expresses commands. Commands in Kakua can be expressed by three different
markers that encode specific types of commands. A positive command, which is
marked with the suffix -Ṽ́, a negative command, marked with the suffix -kabuhú,
and a command that solicits an action to be performed for the benefit of someone
else, marked with the suffix -ʔabuhú.
Like declarative and interrogative moods, the imperative moods can serve
to form types of clauses. The host of the imperative suffixes is the predicate (or verb
as in Table 10.3). Examples of these three imperative markers are given below:
59) kan=diʔ měm
3SG=OBJ 2SG
‘leave it!’ma=fwẽh-é2SG=leave-IMP60) ma=beh-kabuhú

61) kǎn=diʔ
ʔɨ ̃̂b-áʔbuhú
3SGM=OBJ
take.out-IMP2
‘take it out (for somebody else)’
Note that, unlike the interrogative, the dubitative modality does not express a question, given
that the category of modality, as adopted here from Hengeveld (2004), does not have the ability to form
clause types. A question is a type of clause, whereas the dubitative modality expresses doubt, and not
necessarily a question. See the description on dubitative modality in §10.5.1 below.
10Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality287Usually additional modality (and tense and aspect) distinctions are not
expressed in imperative clauses. Whenever the clause is further specified for these
distinctions, the TAME markers occur on another element of the clause, which can
take all of the needed TAME morphology:

"Basic clause structure and types of clauses329distribution with the declarative marker =na. The interrogative marker =nit occurs
with the same hosts as the declarative marker =na; that is, interrogative =nit can
occur with predicates, as well as with nouns (including pronouns, demonstratives),
and with adjectives. Examples (59)-(62) below illustrate polar interrogative clauses.
Examples (59)-(60) show affirmative polar interrogative clauses. Negative
interrogative clauses are illustrated in (61)-(62):̃̌

Common greetings in Kakua are similar to polar questions, but the
interrogative marker =nit is often omitted in these. These greetings do not elicit
information, as they refer to an action for which the speaker has clear direct evidence
and thus doesn’t require an answer. Note that, since the declarative marker can be
omitted in declarative clauses, the type of clauses presented below can alternatively
be analyzed as declarative clauses. The examples below illustrate a morning greeting
(65) and arrival greetings (66)-(67):330A Grammar of Kakua65) ma=hâ
2SG=get.up
‘are you up?’̃̌ ʔ
66) ma=hɨw
2SG=arrive.here
‘have you arrived?’
67) ma=tɨ ̃̂j
2SG=be.good
‘how are you?’ (lit. you good)
Departure greetings do require the interrogative clitic. Example (68)
illustrates the typical greeting directed towards those who are leaving. Again, it does
not elicit information, as it is used even when the process of leaving is taking place
in the presence of the speaker.
68) ma=beh=nit
2SG=go=INTERR
‘are you leaving?’
Another exception to obligatory marking with the interrogative clitic =nit in
polar questions occurs in traditional Kakua storytelling. This practice requires one
or more “responders” whose role in the event is to respond to the person telling the
story. The response often consists of repeating the last sentence of the main narrator.
This “response” can be understood as a question,4 but the interrogative marker =nit
is not required. Example (69) below comes from a story-telling event of a folktale.
Speaker A is telling the story, and speaker B is the designated “responder”. His or
her duty is to ask questions to the speaker while the story is being told. Speaker B
asks the questions without using the interrogative marker =nit. When inquired about
this, speakers reported that everybody assumes that the denominated “responder” is
asking questions, and therefore the use of the interrogative marker =nit was
considered redundant (although possible):4I assume this because it is the only accepted translation that speakers give, and also because themain narrator gives an affirmative answer. Also, when having conversations in Spanish with me, theKakua speakers will use the same formula, though in Spanish they will use the interrogative intonation to
indicate that the repetition of the sentence said by one of the speakers represents a ‘rhetorical question’,
or just a figure of speech.","[349, 350, 351]"
"Basic clause structure and types of clauses325The locative enclitic, as illustrated in the examples above, attaches to the head
noun of the locative NP. The locative-marked NP tends to occur in initial position
(preceding core arguments). However, it can also be seen in the examples above
(e.g., (41) and (44) that an alternative placement of the locative adjunct is possible).
A second set of constructions expressing locative meanings are those
involving a positional verb, in which the verb specifies the location/position of the
nominal. This verb often appears as part of a serial verb construction (see Chapter
9). Constructions of this type do not require the locative marker =bǔ. Examples are
given in (46)-(47) below:

independent clauses in Kakua. Declarative clauses are described in §12.9, followed
by a section describing interrogative polar and content questions (§12.10). Section
§12.11 provides a description of affirmative imperative clauses and §12.12 of
negative imperatives. These sections show that these types of clauses differ in their
possibility of encoding evidential categories.
All of these clause types have dedicated markers, as given in Table 11.2
below. Additional description and exemplification of these markers are also
presented in other chapters. Chapter 10 on TAME describes the meanings of these
markers in the context of other markers encoding mood, e.g., frustrative, dubitative,
and other moods. Chapter 8 gives a basic template of the verb and describes the
syntactic position of these markers within the verbal word.

12.9Declarative clausesDeclarative clauses in Kakua are those expressing statements (in the sense of
Palmer 2001:65). Declarative clauses are morphologically marked by the clitic =na.
Note, however, that in many cases the declarative marker does not occur. The criteria
predicting the omission, or facultative marking, of the declarative clitic, are left for
future research.
From a formal perspective declarative clauses do not have special
phonological features (like, for example, dedicated intonation, or other phonological
traits to be found exclusively in declarative clauses) nor do they have a special
constituent order. Declarative clauses can express affirmative or negative statements,
as seen in the examples in (48)-(49) below:

12.10 Interrogative clauses12.10.0 Interrogative clauses
Kakua has two main types of interrogative clauses: Content (or questionword) interrogative clauses, and polar (yes-no) interrogative clauses. Content
questions (§12.10.2 below) are formed by using interrogative pronouns or other
interrogative words like interrogative demonstratives and/or adverbials (see Chapter
7 on interrogative pronouns and question words). Polar interrogative clauses
(§12.10.1 below), on the other hand, are morphologically marked by the clitic =nit.
Interrogative clauses contrast with declarative clauses in that the declarative marker
=na does not occur in interrogative clauses. They do not differ from declarative
clauses in word order. Also no particular intonational pattern is required to
exclusively mark interrogative clauses (although in future work intonation patterns
in interrogative clauses should be looked at carefully).. Interrogative clauses can be
both affirmative and negative. When negative, the verbal predicate must be marked
by the negation suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’, or the negative existential wîɁikan ‘not.exist’
is used. Compare the following examples:
54) wã=ʔip
ma-=hiʔ̃́

‘what do you not know?’ʔã=t-ʔên3SG.M=EVID-seeměm2SGhêjʔ-kanknow-NEGInterrogative clauses differ further from declarative clauses (§12.9 above) in
that interrogative clauses have not been found to occur with the entire range of
evidentiality distinctions (I have found them occuring only with the inferred
evidential markers). Further research should focus on specifically testing for
acceptance of each of the evidential markers in interrogative clauses and explore the
reasons why some (at least the inferred category) are allowed to occur whereas other
categories are not. Examples (55) above and (58) below illustrate interrogative
clauses occurring with the inferred evidential. It is interesting to note that evidential
markers can occur in interrogative clauses, even though one might think that
evidential marking presupposes assertion.
Additionally, the interrogative marker can also co-occur with the dubitative
mood suffix -hi ‘DUB’ in the same clause, as illustrated in (60) below. See Chapter
10 for further descriptions of interaction of the interrogative mood with evidentiality
and other mood markers.
58) měm
ma=ta-naʔa-beh=ta=nit

2SG=EVID-want-go=INF.EVID=INTERR

Polar interrogative clauses and content interrogative clauses differ in that
polar questions must obligatorily be marked with the interrogative mood clitic =nit,
while in interrogative clauses formed with question words, the presence of = nit is
optional, and it is most often omitted.","[345, 346, 347, 348, 349]"
"Types of morphemes and word classes111Personal pronouns are specified by number (singular and plural), and person
(first, second or third person). Gender distinction in Kakua is specified only for third
person singular.
The Kakua pronouns are summarized in Table 3.5 and discussed in detail in
Chapter 7.

Chapter 5), or be combined with the possessor marker –íʔ, undergoing phonological
fusion with the possessor marker to create possessive pronouns which are also
proclitics. Free pronominal forms do not have possessive variant forms, i.e., there
are no free possessive pronouns such as English ‘his, their, my’. The free forms of
personal pronouns cannot be possessed, i.e. they cannot take the possessor suffix –
íʔ.
Table 3.6 illustrates the forms for the phonologically fused person proclitics:

"Closed classes3.3.0 Introduction
This section describes the closed classes of words. These classes in Kakua are
parts of speech whose membership is limited and that do not allow for the
introduction of new elements.
As opposed to the elements that form the open classes of words, the
morphology of the members of the closed classes is more restricted, i.e., closed
classes of words have a smaller range of bound morphemes with which they can
occur compared to the members of the open classes.
The members of the closed classes do not allow for an unlimited number of
elements. This justifies their recognition as closed word classes.
The closed classes of words in Kakua are: pronouns, interrogative pronouns
and question words, demonstratives, numerals, quantifiers, adjectives, adverbs and
other particles such as emphasis tags, discourse particles, exclamations, interjections,
and hesitation particles.
Each of these closed classes are introduced in the following subsections and
discussed in detail in further relevant chapters. An overview of Kakua’s pronominal
paradigm is given in §3.3.1; interrogative pronouns and question words are described
in §3.3.2. Demonstratives are presented in §3.3.3. A summarized description of
numerals and quantifiers is presented in §3.3.4. The closed set of adjectives and how
adjectives can be formed is described in §3.3.5. Adverbs are described in §3.3.6.
Finally, the main range of Kakua’s assorted particles is be described in §3.3.7.",[132]
"These types of questions remain unanswered and need further comparative
and diachronic research.",[319]
"Chapter 7
Elements of the noun phrase
7.0IntroductionThis chapter describes other words from closed classes that occur in the noun
phrase. In particular this chapter deals with the description of pronouns,
demonstratives, questions words, numerals and quantifiers in Kakua, and further
additional elements of the noun phrase.
The noun phrase in Kakua is built according to the template in (1) below.
Demonstratives (DEM), lexical possessors (POSS), pronouns (PN) including
possessive and interrogative pronouns, numerals (NUM) and quantifiers (Quant) all
precede the head noun. A head noun may be a bare noun root (see Chapter 4), a
compound of noun roots (see Chapter 5), or another derived noun (e.g., a
nominalized verb stem, or a noun stem taking some derivational morphology). Any
of the elements shown in (1) below with the exception of modifiers can also function
as a noun phrase on its own. Modifiers of the head noun (adjectives or nominalized
verbs) may precede or follow the head noun (see discussion on adjectives in Chapter
3, §3.2.1).
1)NP  (Dem) (POSS/PN) (Num/Quant) (modifiers) (POSS=)N (modifiers)Each of the elements of the noun phrase shown in (1) above occurs only once
within the noun phrase. This Chapter is organized as follows. Section §7.1 provides
a description of personal pronouns. Interrogative pronouns and question words are
dealt with in Section §7.2, and the demonstrative pronouns are described in §7.3.
The description of numerals (§7.4) and quantifiers (§7.5) follows. The last section
on this chapter, §7.6, presents the emphasis marker =bǔ as another element of the
noun phrase. For the description of the coordination of noun phrases see Chapter 13.","[232, 233]"
"Introduction: Kakua and its speakers15description of Puinave). This latter branch, he states, cannot be clearly demonstrated
although it is considered probable. Martins’ Eastern and Western branches together
conform what he proposes as a Macro-Makú family.
Epps (2005:10; 2008) critically questions the ‘Makú’ grouping, and presents
a skeptical view of affiliating Kakua, Nɨkak, and Puinave with what she suggested
should be called a Nadahup family –the members of which are Hup, Yuhup, Dâw
and Nadëb.
Finally, Girón (2008:428-435), also questioning the ‘Makú’ grouping
(Puinave included), presents evidence that can play both in favor or against, a ‘Makú’
linguistic classification, and states that the evidence is inconclusive to claim that
these languages form a linguistic family (here Girón includes Puinave, Kakua, Nɨkak,
Hup, Yuhup, Dâw and Nadëb).
In 2009, with newly available data from Kakua, Bolaños & Epps (2009) take
a critical position towards the classification of Kakua into the Nadahup language
group, arguing that regular sound correspondences were not found to support such a
linguistic relationship. Puinave was not included in Bolaños & Epps’ 2009
comparative study.
Only in 2015, with extensive data on Kakua, Hup and more novel data on
Dâw, Epps & Bolaños (submitted) conclude that the linguistic evidence does not
support a genetic affiliation between Nadahup and Kakua, Nɨkak and Puinave.
Furthermore, they suggest a Nadahupan language family –which includes Hup,
Yuhup, Dâw, Nadëb-, a Kakua-Nukakan family (including Kakua and Nɨkak, see
Epps & Bolaños submitted), and Puinave as a separate language from these families.
They strongly discourage the continued use of the term ‘Makú’ since it does not
represent a linguistic classification and because of its highly pejorative social
connotations for the speakers of these languages.","[36, 37]"
"10.4 Illocution
10.4.0 Introduction
Illocution refers to a semantic subgroup of mood markers that function to
express the communicative intention with which the speaker presents a proposition.
As such, the communicative status of the proposition in Kakua can be that of an
assertion, a question, or a command. This section deals with these three basic
illocution markers, namely declarative (§10.4.1), interrogative (§10.4.2), and
imperative (§10.4.3).
The markers of illocution are presented here only briefly in order to illustrate
their semantics. This is because these markers have a formal distinction as well as a
semantic one: they have the ability to form clause types (clause types are described5A formal description of illocution marking is presented in Chapter 12 (clause types).",[302]

Introduction: Kakua and its speakers
1.0IntroductionKakua is an Amazonian language spoken in the linguistic area of the Vaupés,
in Northwest Amazonia, eastern Colombia (the Ethnologue/ISO 639-3 code for
Kakua is cbv; the WALS code is cac).
The language is a member of the small Kakua-Nɨkak language family.1 Its
speakers live in inland forest settlements. Two main settlements are home to most of
Kakua’s approximately 250 speakers. The largest of these two settlements is
Wacará2, with 183 individuals.3 Wacará is located between the Vaupés and the
Querarí Rivers in Colombian territory approximately 100 kilometers to the east of
Mitú, near the Brazilian border (see Map 1 below).
The second bigger Kakua settlement is Nuevo Pueblo, which is an inland
forest village between the Vaupés and the Papurí rivers. The number of inhabitants
of this village is approximately 40 ~ 45 individuals.
About 10-15 other speakers of Kakua live scattered either in villages inhabited
by speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages (a neighboring language family), or on
their own in remote interfluvial settlements.
The present work undertakes a grammatical description of the Kakua
language. The description is based mainly on dialects spoken in the Kakua village
of Wacará. Kakua is divided into two main dialect areas (see §1.6 below), in each of
these areas, there are some clan-specific varieties.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"
"14A Grammar of KakuaGrünberg 1906: 881-882).10 When it comes to Kakua, however, he is very careful
with proposing a relationship between Kakua and Yuhup (Makú of Río Tiquié) and
Dâw (Makú of Río Curicuriarý), and rather includes in a footnote a list of 9 lexical
resemblances between Yuhup and Kakua (Koch-Grünberg 1906:882 footnote).
Although Koch-Grünberg says that the sound of these three languages is
similar, he is emphatic in saying that only with great reservations can Kakua (Makú
of Papurý) be counted as a member of the same group (1906:882).
A few years later, Paul Rivet and Constant Tastevin provide data on Nadëb,
and in 1920 they publish an article with the first proposal for a genetic relationship
between Kakua, Yuhup, Dâw, and Nadëb, and they include Puinave.
Rivet & Tastevin’s proposal considered Kakua, Dâw and Yuhup (and Nadëb),
as dialects of one and the same ‘Makú’ language, since, according to them, the
relationship among these languages had already been established by Koch-Grünberg.
Thus, the missing data in any of these ‘Makú’ dialects was not regarded since an
entry from another ‘dialect’ of the same language was just enough for them to make
their point on comparing the ‘Makú’ dialects with the Puinave language.
They also appeal to Koch-Grünberg’s careful notes when in 1913 (1913:471)
he states that the sound of Puinave reminds him of the Makú languages from the Río
Negro. Rivet & Tastevin, however, lack to include also Koch-Grünberg’s mention
that the Puinave language had lexically nothing in common with the Makú languages
of the Río Negro.
Rivet & Tastevin conclude that due to the similarities found (based strongly
on pronominal forms that derive in large part from transcription errors, and other
lexical entries that have themselves also many transcription flaws), and the “previous
observations” of Koch-Grünberg, the ‘Makú’ dialects should be considered as
genetically related to Puinave, and therefore they propose a Makú-Puinave family.
This affiliation proposed by Rivet & Tastevin remained widely accepted,
mainly due to lack of additional data on these languages. With the addition of Hup
and Nɨkak into the ‘Makú’ family classification, many scholars continued to refer to
these languages as members of the family until the end of the 20th century (e.g.
Nimuendajú 1950: 149, Greenberg 1960, Loukotka 1968 [1935]: 190-193, Mason
1950: 257, Kaufman 1990: 41, 1994: 60, Campbell 1997: 183).
The early 21st century saw a change in this, and many scholars began to
question the ‘Makú’ classification or raised doubts about one or some of its members.
Martins & Martins (1999) question the affiliation of Puinave to the ‘Makú’ family.
V. Martins (2005: 331-2, 341) suggests a relationship between two Makú
branches: an Eastern Makú branch (Makú Oriental) in which he includes Hup,
Yuhup, Dâw and Nadëb; and a Western Makú branch (Makú Ocidental) in which he
includes Kakua, Nɨkak (see Cabrera et al. 1999; Mahecha 2009; Mahecha et al. 2000
for linguistic information on Nɨkak) and Puinave (see Girón 2008 for a linguistic
10 Original in German “Viele Wörter sind in beiden Sprachen identisch oder weisen nur geringedialektische Unterschiede auf, die zum Teil wohl auch der Schwierigkeit bei der Aufnahme zuzuschreiben
sind.”","[35, 36]"
"282A Grammar of Kakuain Chapter 12, sections §12.9, §12.10, and §12.11 for declarative, interrogative, and
imperative clauses respectively. Negation is also described in Chapter 12).
In the characterization of the morphological markers of illocution, Hengeveld
notes that “by their very nature, basic illocutions [this is declarative, interrogative
and imperative, KB] are restricted to independent sentences and quotations. This
feature will be of help in distinguishing illocutionary from modal categories”
(Hengeveld 2004:1191). This is, however, not a characteristic of the morphological
markers of illocution in Kakua, for these markers are not restricted to independent
clauses and may occur in subordinate clauses (see example (47) below, and Chapter
13, for examples of declarative marker occurring in subordinated clauses).
The different markers of illocution mood in Kakua are summarized in Table
10.3 below.

"10.2.3 Telic progressive aspect: suffix -fɨɁɨ
The suffix -fɨɁɨ ‘TEL.PROG’ serves to express a situation that, like the one
described for the progressive aspect above, encodes the continuity of an
(imperfective) event, but additionally it also particularly encodes an event which
must have an end point. For lack of a better term, I am labeling this suffix as a telic
progressive. This suffix partially conforms to the general definition of telic aspect, 4
For the general definition of telic aspect I follow here Comrie’s (1975:44-45) definition of telic
as “a telic situation is one that involves a process that leads up to a well-defined terminal point beyond
4Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality279but doesn’t fully conform to this. Like a telic aspect, the suffix -fɨɁɨ in Kakua does
express “a process that leads up to a well-defined terminal point…’ (Comrie
1975:44-45); however, unlike telic (as defined in Comrie 1975:44-45), the telic
progressive suffix in Kakua doesn’t necessarily encode that the situation cannot
continue beyond the terminal point defined. In other words, the telic progressive
aspect in Kakua specifies that the situation is occurring up to a terminal point, but
this terminal point is not necessarily the end point of the situation, as this situation
may still continue (see example (38) below, where the endpoint of the activity, i.e.,
stop eating, does not necessarily entail that the object of the activity, i.e., the food,
will also be finished once the eating has stopped).
The telic progressive aspect suffix in Kakua is translated with the adverbial
form in English ‘still’ or ‘yet’, where the situation described is still occurring (and
in this sense is an imperfective situation) but is expected to have, at some point, an
intrinsic end.
Some examples of the telic progressive suffix are given below. It is important
to highlight, however, that the occurrence of this suffix in the corpus is not very
common, and only after being prompted with specific elicitations was I able to gather
sufficient data to support the semantics of this form. It is curious, though, that Kakua
bilingual speakers in Spanish will persistently use the Spanish adverb todavía (‘still’
or ‘yet’), but in their constructions in Kakua they will rather use the progressive form
ʧãhãp described above. When questioned regarding the possibility of translating the
same sentences with todavía into Kakua by using the telic progressive suffix -fɨɁɨ
‘TEL.PROG’, instead of the ‘default’ progressive ʧãhãp ‘PROG’ speakers concluded
that translations of todavía sentences with -fɨɁɨ ‘TEL.PROG’ might be more accurate,
though the use of the progressive ʧãhãp in the todavía sentences was not regarded
as incompatible either. The examples below do come from natural text.
38) hěmɁ-fɨɁɨ=na
eat-TEL.PROG=DECL
‘(she) still eats’
39) ʧɨ ̃̂d-fɨɁɨ=na
sit-TEL.PROG=DECL
‘still sitting’
40) jâwa-fɨɁɨ=na=hĩ
fill.up.liquid-TEL.PROG=DECL=REM.PST
‘(he) was still filling up’
Having an implied reference to an ending point, the telic progressive aspect
can be said to be in competition with the progressive in situations that can be
interpreted both as atelic or telic. This may explain why in some cases Kakua
which the process cannot continue […] In expressions referring to telic situations it is important that there
should be both a process leading up to the terminal point as well as the terminal point”280A Grammar of Kakuaspeakers accept both progressive ʧãhãp and telic progressive -fɨɁɨ. One such example
is given in (41) and (42) below. Example (41) occurred in natural speech. Sentence
(42) was elicited during the dry season. Given that the dry season was expected to
end soon, the speaker accepted the elicited form in (42) as valid because of previous
knowledge of an end point of the situation. Note that in any case, there is no overlap
of the progressive and the telic progressive forms:̌ ʔ=na=ka
41) bɨ húptʃi hɨw

‘now summer is coming’ʔã=tʃãhãp3SG=PROǦ ʔ-fɨɁɨ=na=ka
42) bɨ húptʃi hɨw
now
summer come-TEL.PROG=DECL=ASS
‘now summer is still coming’
Finally, it is possible to consider that the telic progressive suffix -fɨɁɨ is either
falling in disuse (for which a test comparing its use across generations would be
needed), or that it has just recently been introduced into Kakua (for which
comparative evidence would be required). Only future research will give more
answers to the fascinating semantics and uses of this telic progressive aspect -fɨɁɨ.","[299, 300, 301]"
"Complex Clauses355As in the case of the different subject clitic, the same subject clitic can attach
to elements other than verbs. This is illustrated below (see also (15) above, where
the same subject clitic occurs on a pronoun):7nɨwá
měm
23) [tɨ ̀jpeʔ=nit]=be
at.last=S.S=REC.PST grandfather.VOC 2SG

ma=ʔɨ ̂bʔ-hɨwkǎn=diʔ3SG.M=OBJma=ʔinwɨʔ=diʔ
̌2SG=take-come-IMP
2SG=relative=OBJ
‘Finally granddad! you bring him!, to your relative’
In summary, there are two clitics in Kakua that often seem to indicate a
change or maintenance of the subject across clauses, be these combinations of
independent clauses or combinations of independent and subordinate clauses. Note
that example (20) also involves the repetition of the verb and the object of the
preceding clause, as a strategy to temporally link independent clauses among
themselves. This strategy, described for many languages as tail-head linkage, is
presented in the following subsection.8
Some questions regarding switch reference markers that should be undertaken
in future research are: What conditions the syntactic position of switch reference
markers? What are the semantic, discourse, syntactic or pragmatic environments that
favors the occurrence of switch reference markers? Are the conditions regarding
their occurrence in main clauses different from the once governing their occurrence
in subordinate clauses?","[375, 376]"

Basic clause structure and types of clauses
12.0IntroductionThis chapter describes the basic clause structure and the different clause types
in Kakua. Section §12.1 provides an introductory overview of the minimal
requirements to form a clause. Section §12.2 gives a description of copular
constructions involving predicative and existential copulas. In addition to affirmative
existential copulas, Kakua also has a negative existential copula; this type of negative
existential is described in §12.3. Section §12.4 gives a description of predicative
possession. This is followed by a description of comparative constructions in §12.5,
and non-verbal predicates expressing equation in §12.6. Finally, §12.7 provides a
description of the basic locative constructions.
This chapter concludes with a description of Kakua clause types, presented in
4 subsections: declarative clauses in §12.9; interrogative clauses, both polar and
content interrogatives, in §12.10; imperative clauses in §12.11; and negative
imperative clauses in §12.12. Responses to imperative clauses are described in
§12.13, and a summary is found in §12.14.
12.1Minimal clauseA basic sentence in Kakua is composed of at least one independent clause.
An intransitive clause is minimally composed of a predicate (with optional
indexation of the subject by means of a cross-referencing proclitic), as in (1); or an
optional subject NP and a predicate, as in (2), where the subject NP typically
precedes the predicate (SV). Transitive clauses minimally contain a predicate;
additionally, transitive clauses typically contain an overt object NP (though not
obligatorily); the subject NP is optional, and it may be indexed on the predicate by
means of cross-referencing proclitics (3), which are themselves also optional (see
Chapter 11 for description of criteria governing the occurrence of proclitics). In
transitive clauses, the object NP typically precedes the predicate of the clause (SOV)

12.2The affirmative existential copular verb hɨmThe affirmative existential verb hɨm is used in predicative and existential
copular constructions to encode existence, and also permanent states and attribution,
as discussed in this section. Equative constructions in Kakua use a different strategy,
and are formed by the juxtaposition of the NPs without the use of the existential verb
hɨm (see §12.6 below). Note that the verb hɨm ‘exist’, which is referred to as a copula
here, can function as a predicate on its own, whereas the canonical definition of
copulas expects copulas to not be able to function as predicates on their own right;
see Hengeveld (1992). Examples below illustrate copula constructions in Kakua,
using the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ in its different functions to express permanent
states, existence/location, and attribution:

Kakua does not differ from that shown for other types of verbal constructions
(intransitive, monotransitive, ditransitive), in which the verb is (preferably) in final
position, being preceded by the object and the subject/agent arguments: SOV( cop).
Thus, a copular construction is also preferably of the type SOV. The copular verb in
Kakua takes all of the verbal morphology (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of verbal
morphology). This include interrogative mood (14) and tense and aspect (14)-(17)
(see also the examples above in this section), cross-referencing proclitics,
morphemes indicating evidentiality, as in (16), and nominalizers, as in (17):

inherently negative stative verb wîʔikan denoting the meanings of ‘not to have or not
to exist’. This form can be further analyzed into two morphemes, a verb root wîʔiand the verbal negation suffix –kan. However, the root wîʔi- is obligatorily bound
and cannot occur without the negation suffix –kan, and this verb is thus considered
to be a single negative existential expression. The negative existential verb, like other
Kakua verbs, takes all the verbal morphology available to verbs in general: crossreferencing proclitics (18); TAM affixes (18)-(20), evidentiality prefixes and/or
enclitics (as in (18)-(20)), and derivational suffixes to form adjectives (21):

is qualified by most speakers as odd and is corrected to wîʔikan.
12.4Predicative possession constructionsKakua has two main strategies to express possession. Firstly, the juxtaposition
of the possessor and the possessed NPs, with the possessive marker -ǐʔ suffixed to
the possessor NP for alienable possession, and without the possessive marker for
inalienable possession (see Chapter 5). Secondly, possession can be expressed by
means of a predicative construction (i.e. predicative possession). Predicative
possessive constructions involve the stative possessive verb bibùʔ ‘have/possess’.
The constituent order in predicative possessive constructions is consistent with
Kakua’s preferred SOV order. Thus, the possessor, most often animate, precedes the
possessed NP (usually inanimate), and the verb is at the end of the construction.
Constructions using this verb are illustrated in examples (23)-(26) below:

As seen in the examples above, the predicative possessive verb ‘have’ bibùʔ
takes the common verbal morphology (e.g., subject cross-reference proclitics, tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality). The possessed NP of a predicative possessive
construction is not case marked, even when DOM criteria apply (see Chapter 6).","[335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340]"

(animacy,In the present section I explore the semantic and pragmatic properties of the
object argument conditioning DOM in Kakua, showing that object marking is
obligatory on noun phrases with human referents (and a few others). Other features
given by Creissels in the list above, such as formal properties of the noun phrase, or
semantic transitivity of verbal lexemes and their relation with obligatory marking
(c.f., Hopper & Thompson 1980:259, 272; von Heusinger & Niyazmetowa 2008),
are not considered here, but will need further study. Another factor favouring the
overt marking of object case appears to be word order, where OSV order tends to
favour the overt marking of case on the object argument (see Chapter 11, §11.1).
The criteria conditioning DOM presented here for Kakua should be further
investigated in future research, and many questions remain unanswered for this
version of the description on the grammar of Kakua. Issues regarding topicality, for
example, and the interaction between definiteness and specificity, call for a detailed
study.
This section is subdivided as follows: animacy and DOM in Kakua are
presented in §6.3.1-§6.3.6 while section §6.3.7 describes DOM and definiteness.
Other discourse related criteria that favours the overt marking of object case in
Kakua (namely definiteness) is given in §6.3.7 below. Future research should be

"Comparative noteThe quality of nasality or orality as a suprasegmental property is found to be
a phonological feature widely spread among Eastern Tukanoan languages,
suggesting that prosodic nasalization in Kakua responds to a Vaupés areal feature.
A phonological sketch of Kakua’s sister language, Nɨkak, proposes
nasalization as a prosodic feature in Nɨkak (see Cabrera et al. 1999). Presumibly,
Nɨkak speakers previously inhabited the Vaupés area before heading west to their
current territory. The fact that Nɨkak also has prosodic nasalization presents two
interesting questions to be pursued: First, it would be interesting to look at the
possibility that suprasegmental level nasalization was already present in proto
Kakua-Nɨkak. A second possibility, is to consider whether or not the suprasegmental
nasalization feature found in both Kakua and Nɨkak could have been motivated by
areal diffusion, introduced through contact with the Eastern Tukanoan languages
before Nɨkak migrated outside the area onto the west. Eastern Tukanoan languages,
is worth noting, have been described as having nasalization as a suprasegmental
property. An inverse alternative is also possible. Where Kakua-Nɨkak passed on the70A Grammar of Kakuasuprasegmental nasalization phenomena to the languages that arrived into the area
after Kakua-Nɨkak have already been settled ther.
Unlike Eastern Tukanoan languages, Kakua does not present spreading of
nasalization into units beyond the morpheme to which it is specified. From a
comparative perspective, this represents a significant difference with the nasalization
pattern found in the Tukanoan languages spoken in the Vaupés.
It could also be the case that suprasegmental nasalization in Kakua and Nɨkak
was already in place in the proto language before their contact with Tukanoan
languages. However, the fact that nasalization in these languages is so similar to
what is found in many other of the Vaupés languages, makes it highly likely that this
phonological feature responds to an areal pattern. If so, it would also be very
interesting to determine whether prosodic nasalization affected Kakua and Nɨkak
before their splitting or independently after the splitting.
Finally, Epps (2005:76-77) discusses the possibility that prosodic nasalization
has developed in Hup through contact with Tukano, given the absence of nasalization
as a suprasegmental feature in Dâw and Nadëb (Hup’s sister languages spoken
outside of the Vaupés area and in little contact with Tukano).","[91, 92]"

‘because he fell asleep, the jaguar ate him’ (reported information)Prefixes in Kakua must be preceded by a proclitic (with the exception of the
reflexive/reciprocal prefix mik-, see Chapter 7). Thus, a second-hand evidential
prefix (and this applies also to the nonvisual evidential prefix described above) must
be preceded by a proclitic. If there is no person proclitic, the clause is only marked
with the relevant enclitic, as in (93) below:
93) hêjʔ-kan=ta=be
know-NEG=INF.EVID=REC.PST
‘(they) didn’t know’ (I infer)10.6.4 Inferred evidentiality
Encoding inferences in Kakua requires at least one morphological marker. As
described above, Kakua has a prefix form, t- or ta-, which expresses second-hand
evidentiality in general. Additionally, the encliticized forms of these evidentiality
markers further specify inference in a more narrow sense, and often co-occur with
the second-hand evidential prefix.
The forms of these enclitics are: =ta ~ =tagǎ, and =dê. These forms always
encode inferred evidentiality, but they are used in combination with different tenses.
Unlike the forms =ta and =tagǎ, the form =dê does not co-occur with the second
hand prefix t- ~ ta- (described in §10.6.3 above). The clitic =dê encodes an inference
made regarding a situation at a future moment. It is glossed here as a future inferred
evidential ‘FUT.INF.EVID’. The inference expressed with =dê is based on tangible
evidence or evidence that can be corroborated that a certain situation is likely to
occur. Note in example (97) below that the enclitic for future inference = dê does
not necessarily need to co-occur with the future suffix -bip ‘FUT’. Therefore, the
future inference enclitic =dê could also be analyzed as expressing both evidentiality
and future tense.15It is possible that the form of this future inferred evidential has some relation to the basic form
(de-) of interrogative pronouns and questions words (e.g., dedě ‘what’, dêdʔ ‘which’, dêʔe ‘who’, see
Chapter 7, §7.2), although the semantic connection between interrogatives and inference remains unclear.

Using any other of the inferred evidential clitics in future tenses is not
admissible. The same construction in (96), for example, will not be possible to
express using the inferred evidential =tagǎ as illustrated by the inacceptable
sentence below:
96) *wã=beh-min=tagǎ
1SG=go-IMM.FUT=INF.EVID
Intended meaning ‘I’ll leave (soon, most possibly)’

below:

kãk=na=ka
WHAT=FUT.INF.EVID=EMPH
person=DECL=ASS
‘will it probably be a person indeed?’
For tenses other than the future, the basic form of the inferred evidential is
the clitic =ta. If the inference refers to a situation occurring in the remote past, then
=ta immediately precedes the remote past marker =hĩ, as in (98). If the situation
occurred in the recent past, then =ta immediately precedes the recent past clitic
=be, as in (99):

‘after having gone, they ate’ (I infer from food leftovers)
Making inferences referring to a present situation, the form of the inferred
clitic is =tagǎ. It is possible that this form comes from a fusion of the inferred
evidential =ta (shown above), and the marker of assertion=ka, which by someTense, aspect, mood and evidentiality301phonetic processes became [ga], acquired tone, resulting in the form that is now
invariably =tagǎ (never =taka). Note that the marker of assertion=ka does not cooccur with the inferred evidential marker =ta. To the question of where his father
was at the moment of speech, the speaker replied as follows:
100) mâwa=tagǎ
kill=INF.EVID
‘(he) is killing’ (I infer, that is why he is not here)
The use of the form =tagǎ is not restricted to situations in present time. A
good number of examples in the corpus involves the co-occurrence of the form
=tagǎ and the general past suffix -Vp. In these cases, however, the form =tagǎ
never occurs together with either the recent past or remote past clitics (if these tense
clitics were to occur, the form preceding them would always be =ta and never
=tagǎ). This is illustrated in the following example:

It is important to recall also that the assertion marker =ka does not occur
with the inferred evidential marker =ta in either remote or recent past tenses.

different tenses are given below:̌ ʔ-hip=tagǎ

Kakua marks reported information with the enclitic =wɨt, glossed ‘REP.EVID’.
This reported enclitic has a clear etymological source in the Kakua verb wɨt
‘command’ (see comments on this at the end of Chapter 8). This clitic is also used
when quoting someone or in narratives such as mythological stories which are
regarded as events that did occur but were experienced by people who told them to
someone else. It is also used when the original source of the information is unknown,
or unavailable, but nevertheless the information is not regarded as imaginary.

"10.5.3 Assertion mood =ka ~ =kɨ
The clitic =ka expresses assertion by the speaker. By using this clitic, the
speaker expresses her attitude towards the situation, in a sense that it is the speaker
herself who takes responsibility for stating the situation.
This enclitic of assertion has two forms =ka and =kɨ. Kakua speakers of
Nuevo Pueblo use the form =kɨ exclusively. Kakua speakers of Wacará, on the other
hand, use both =ka and =kɨ. The form=ka is used as the general assertion marker.
The form =kɨ appears to have a deictic meaning as well, indicating a spatial distance
between the speaker and the hearer. Thus, the difference between the example from
a text in (74) and the elicited example in (75) is that in (74) the speaker is in close
spatial proximity to the hearer, while in (75) the speaker is presumably speaking
from a distant point. The deictic distinction is not commonly marked, and because
of this I describe the form =ka as the ‘default’ form of the assertion marker.

The marker of assertion, as seen in example (76) above, can occur in
situations anchored in a future tense. In these cases, the assertion marker is
acceptable if the future situation is likely to take place, given that the assertion
marker encodes a situation to which the speaker is committed.
The assertion marker can also co-occur in situations that are further specified
for evidentiality, specifically with the reported evidential marker (§10.6.6). InTense, aspect, mood and evidentiality293principle, the assertion marker does not occur with the past and present forms of the
inferred evidentiality marker (see §10.6.5 below), this might have to do with the fact
that inferring that a situation has occurred (inferred evidentiality), doesn’t represent
the confidence needed for the speaker to commit an assertion towards the situation.
An alternative analysis for the assertion marker possibly having fused with the
inferred evidential marker is presented §10.6.5 below (although an inference in the
future tense can be marked with the assertion marker).","[312, 313, 314]"

Interrogative pronouns, as is the case for the rest of the pronominal forms in
Kakua, do not have different forms when functioning as subject, object, comitative,
locative, etc. Thus, if functioning as an object argument, for example, the
interrogative pronoun does not change its basic form and instead it optionally takes
the object case marker, compare examples (15) and (16) with (17) and (18) below:
17) dêʔe=diʔ=ti=be

Interrogative pronouns can take the possessive suffix -íʔ to encode possessive
relations, as in (19), or be compounded to a noun stem as in (20) below. Note that
in cases such as that illustrated in example (20) below, the interrogative pronoun is
not considered a procliticized form (as with the proclitic personal pronouns) because,
unlike proclitic personal pronouns (possessive personal pronouns), the interrogative
pronoun can stand on its own, like other interrogative words (i.e., can occur
syntactically unbound, like example (23) below where the interrogative dě ‘where’
occurs on its own. Most commonly, however, the interrogative pronouns occur
together with intensifiers or emphasis markers):

It is noteworthy that there is a strong awareness among Kakua speakers about
using the ‘correct’ evidential marking for each situation. The following episode that
occurred during my fieldwork illustrates how important evidential marking is in
Kakua speech. The following example comes from a conversation after watching a
documentary movie about the Nɨkak. Here the speaker is telling what he saw the
night before in the movie. Since this was a movie, choosing the correct evidential
marker is non-trivial, especially because the speaker himself had seen the Nɨkak
people before when they were brought to the Kakua village in the late 1980s. Thus,
he appears to have regarded the images in the movie as projections of situations in
the real world. However, a movie, or a photographic image, is not regarded as a
direct visual experience, but as information experienced through some other sensorial
means. The speaker hesitated on what evidential marker he should use, and, as seen
in the example below, he repeats the same predicate ( ʔĩ-t=jǎk-bâbʔ-bâbʔ=hĩ
3PL=EVID-cook-drink-drink=REM.PST ‘they cooked and drank’) various times until
he finally decides that expressing the proposition as visually experienced, without
any formal marking, is the most accurate way to tell his version of the story. The
text continued with the speaker only using the visual (unmarked) form.","[323, 324]"

Additionally, in some examples, such as the one presented in (27) below,
there seem to be different tense values for the tail-head linking verbs. Note in the
following example that the ‘repeated’ verb is marked for remote past, while in the
preceding instance it is marked for recent past. Examples such as this also raise
questions regarding the exact way in which this strategy of repetition of predicates
relates to the canonical description of tail-head linking strategies.

De Vries (2005:376f), in a typological study of tail-head linkage in Papuan
languages, reports that in some of those languages, instead of repeating the last
predicate of the ‘tail’ clause, the tail-head linkage is formed by using a verb meaning
‘do’ or ‘be’ (translating into ‘having done that/so’ or ‘being so’). This type of linkage
strategy de Vries labels ‘generic verb linkage’.11 Similar to this, Kakua often uses
the verb pêa ‘finish’ as the linking ‘generic’ verb instead of repetition of the same
predicate in the ‘tail’ clause is used. This strategy in Kakua serves as a temporal
linkage of clauses, indicating the temporal sequence of the events. The translation
given in these constructions is ‘after finishing VERB’, referring to the completion of
the event expressed by the predicate of the ‘tail’ clause. See the following example:

"320A Grammar of Kakua12.5Comparative constructionsThe function of comparative constructions in Kakua is to assign the relative
position of two referents on a predicative scale. Comparative constructions,
according to the terminology used in Stassen (1985), involve the following elements:
the standard of comparison (the NP indicating the object that serves as the yardstick
of the comparison); the comparee (the object that is being compared); the parameter
(the property on which the comparison is based), and the index (referring to the type
of comparison). The last two, i.e. the parameter and the index, are referred to as the
scale.
Kakua comparative constructions include those in which the scale of
comparison expresses standards referred to as being less than, more than, and equal
to the compared entity. In these types of constructions, the scale is expressed by verb
roots, without additional TAME morphology, affixes or proclitics. In these cases, the
verb root by itself indicates the scale of comparison. Examples (27)-(29) illustrate
the use of the verb tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’ not functioning as a predicate, but as a scale for
comparison. The order of constituents in comparative constructions is as follows: the
comparee precedes the standard, and the position of the scale of comparison (e.g.,
tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’) is free.

comparison meaning ‘be less than’. Note that in these examples, as in (27)-(29) above
and (30) below, the verb expressing the scale for comparison does not take additional
TAM affixes and its function within the clause is not that of a predicate, but of a
scale of comparison:Basic clause structure and types of clauses

be.alike this.F
‘like this short, the younger brother was shorter (than the older ones), just like
Chavela’
Semblative comparison, in which the standard and the comparee are
conceived to be of equal degree on a given scale, are formed by using different
particles encoding meanings such as ‘be alike’, ‘like this’, ‘and so like this’, ‘be
equal’, ‘be similar to’. Choosing one particle or another depends primarily on
whether or not the speaker can physically signal the relative dimension of the
standard of comparison, and on the physical proximity of the speaker to the standard
of comparison. For example, if the speaker points to a tree in the distance as the
yardstick for comparison of height, then the particle paniʔna ‘and so like this’ (or its
shortened allomorph panʔ) would be used. This particle is also used whenever the
standard of comparison is not visually accessible. If instead the speaker physically
touches the yardstick of comparison, or uses gestures to indicate its dimensions, then
most often the particle mɨn ‘be equal’ is used.
Example (30) above, highlights the use of particles mɨn ‘be equal’, and paʔniʔ
‘be alike/be like this’. During the utterance of the first line in the example, the
speaker was indicating how short the younger brother is with a hand gesture, by
placing one hand below with the palm of the hand facing upwards, and the other
hand higher up with its palm facing downwards. In this case the speaker uses the
particle mɨn ‘be equal’. Then, the speaker pointed at Chavela (a young girl listening
to the conversation), expressing that ‘the younger brother’ in the tale was about her
size; for this comparison the speaker uses the particle paʔniʔ ‘be alike/be like this’.
Additional examples of semblative comparatison are given in (31)-(33) below.
A further description of Kakua’s particles, including the ones occurring within
comparative constructions, can be found in Chapter 3.

The superlative, describing a situation in which the comparee has the highest
degree among the standards of comparison, is expressed by using the noun niʔat
‘all/everything’, as in (34), or by using an emphasizing construction, as in (35),
where the nominalized verb jǔb ‘be true’ serves to express that the referent of the
noun keh ‘fish’ is the biggest among the referents of the standard of comparison
noun bita ‘others’. These examples additionally illustrate that the noun phrase
expressing the standard can be case-marked. Maybe this indicates that the standard
is regarded as a syntactic object. There is no explanation why it is that sometimes
comparees are object marked while other times they are not (the animacy hierarchy
governing DOM does not seem to predict object marking in these cases).

Note that an alternative analysis of these constructions may seem to be that
the copula has been omitted, i.e. as ‘zero copula’ construction. According to the
standard definition of copula constructions (Hengeveld 1992, Pustet 2003, and
especially Stassen 1994), a ‘zero copula’ type of construction presupposes that there
is a syntactic slot that is otherwise filled by another element, or in which a copula
occurs optionally under certain grammatical criteria. The examples shown in this
subsection, however, are not considered here as copula constructions with a zero
copula, because it is not the case that in these constructions a syntactic slot remains
empty in a restricted context, while alternating with an overt copula in some other
contexts. The examples presented in this section do not have alternatives with an
overt copula.
Additionally, the simple juxtaposition of related elements in Kakua is a very
common strategy to express many different types of relations (e.g., derivation of
nouns Chapter 5, possession Chapter 5, coordination of clauses Chapter 13). It should
not be surprising then that expressing these more ‘permanent’ states of being (as
opposed to the less permanent states of being illustrated in the examples in section
§12.2) also appeal to the juxtaposition of elements as a way to express these more
permanent states of being.
12.7Basic locative constructionsA basic locative construction (or BLC), as defined in Levinson and Wilkins
(2006:15), is a type of construction that predominantly “occurs in response to a
Where-question”. There are two different options for expressing locative relations in324A Grammar of KakuaKakua. One is by means of the locative clitic =bǔ,1 the other by means of positional
verbs (of which Kakua has an extensive set). This section describes these two types
of basic locative construction. Further information on the locative marker =bǔ and
its functions is found in Chapter 6 on grammatical relations and case marking.
Chapter 8 provides more information on the semantics of positional verbs in the
context of the description of Kakua verbs.
The locative marker =bǔ serves to express a variety of locative meanings,
among them allative ‘to/into’ and ablative ‘from’. Positional verbs cover inessive
‘in’, and adessive ‘on’ locative meanings. Examples (40)-(45) below illustrate the
stative locative, and the allative and ablative locative meanings expressed by the
locative clitic =bǔ :2

a clear distinction between analyzing this type of construction as N-classifier
constructions or as N-N compounding. The analysis can go either way. This is

The inventory of Kakua classifiers comprises a rather small set of forms, if
compared to that found in other languages of the Vaupés linguistic area (especially
that described for Arawak Tariana (Aikhenvald 2003), which displays a long list of
classifiers for shape, function, quantification, and other meanings that Aikhenvald
(2003:87ff) calls specific classifiers. Also, Gómez-Imbert (1996) describes a large
set of shape classifiers found in Tukanoan languages, most of which have semantics
relating to the form or shape of the noun referent to which they are suffixed.
As stated in the section above, the distinction between classifiers and regular
compounded nouns is fuzzy and the identification of classifiers is primarily based on
their common semantics and functions.
The set of classifiers in Kakua numbers 15 suffixes for shape specifications,
2 classifiers for texture, and 2 gender classifiers (Tables 5.1 - 5.3). The first two sets
are used with inanimate referents, while the latter is exclusively used with animate
referents (there are, however, some examples where animate referents are also taking
a classifier for shape). Tables 5.1 – 5.3 also indicate the possible etymology of this
subclass of classifiers in Kakua. This information is important also because
classifiers specifying texture are clearly related to Kakua native nouns, again blurring
the distinction between noun compounding and classifier constructions. Some
classifiers specifying for shape/form have a clear etymology from Kakua nouns or
verb roots, and some others are very likely borrowed from Arawak or Tukanoan
languages, as further discussed in sections §5.2.6 - §5.2.8.
Note that, unlike Eastern Tukanoan languages and Arawak Tariana spoken in
the Vaupés, Kakua does not have a dedicated classifier to signal animacy of entities.
Gómez-Imbert (1996:448-449), for example, in her discussion of Tukanoan, presents
an animate/inanimate distinction in the plural, whereas in the singular animates are
marked as masculine (or non-feminine) or feminine. Kakua does not make this
animate/inanimate distinction in neither plural nor singular forms, and, as illustrated
in §5.2.6, makes a gender distinction for feminine only in restricted contexts.
Additionally, Tariana (Aikhenvald 2003:87ff) is described as having a classifier to
signal animacy of entities.
The following Tables 5.1-5.3 show a comprehensive list of all classifiers in
Kakua. Note that the possible etymologies given in these tables do not exhaustively
explore all possible etymological sources, but they nevertheless serve to show
interesting connections between Kakua classifiers and some other Amazonian
languages.","[170, 171, 172]"
"202A Grammar of Kakua6.3.6 Inanimates
Marking of object case for inanimate noun phrases is optional. Whether they
are marked for object case can be predicted to some degree on the basis of their
definiteness or possibly other discourse related characteristics (i.e., marking of object
case for inanimate noun phrases occurs in some contexts but not others, and when it
does occurs, it might be required by contexts rather than based on the speaker’s
choice). However, in elicitation object case marking on inanimate noun phrases is
always judged acceptable by speakers. Thus, the overt marking of object case for
inanimate entities in object function is not ungrammatical in Kakua, but commonly
omitted. See examples (57)-(58) below where inanimate entities in object function
are marked:
57) tɨ ̃̂=diʔ

Compare these to examples (59)-(60) below, where the object argument is

To avoid ambiguity, constructions involving the interaction between
inanimate referents in two or more argument positions require obligatory object
marking. See example (62) below. If in this example the object argument is
unmarked, it is judged ambiguous by speakers:
62) mâ-naʔ
mɨ=diʔ
ʔã=t-dah-mâw=na=ka
tree-CL:tree.like
house=OBJ
3SG.M=EVID-breakhit/kill=DECL=ASS
‘the tree will probably break the house’ (if it falls onto it)
Examples like the ones in (58) and (61) above (also example (80) below) raise
an important question for future research. In these examples (and many others), the
object marker occurs with some sort of goal function (like in húptʃi=diʔ ‘year=OBJ’
in example (61), or wãptʃǐ=diʔ ‘manioc.field=OBJ’ in (58), or location function as
in Wacará=diʔ=mǔn ‘wacara=OBJ=ASSOC.PL’ in (80) below). This suggests a
possibility of describing the object case marker =diɁ ‘OBJ’ as a marker of nonsubject function, rather than strictly an object marker. See also further discussion in
§6.4.1 below regarding marking of object case in adjuncts.","[223, 224, 225]"
"6.3.7 DOM and definiteness
Another typologically common condition on DOM is the definiteness of the
object argument (c.f., Comrie 1989; Iemmolo 2011), and the related notion of
specificity. By definiteness, I mean that the speaker assumes that the hearer can
identify the referent, by indefinite reference that he/she does not. Indefinite reference
can be further divided into specific reference and nonspecific reference. In the case
of specific reference the referent that cannot be identified by the speaker is known
to the speaker, in the case of nonspecific reference the referent is not known to the
speaker. A hierarchy for increasing likelihood of overt object marking relative to
definiteness and specificity is proposed by Croft (2003: 132) (see also Givón 1984:
387):definite < specific < nonspecific204A Grammar of KakuaNote that obligatoriness of object marking in Kakua is determined by animacy
(and whether it is a pronoun). In Kakua, the definiteness of a noun phrase increases
the likelihood that object case markers are used, but case marking on definite noun
phrases is still optional, as examples (47)-(49), among others, show. The following
example illustrates object marking on a definite noun phrase, where it is optional
according to animacy.

‘he heard when the jaguars were eating the turtle’ (the one that the man had left
behind)Example (64) below, illustrates the case where the argument hiw ‘jaguar’ has
no case marker, showing that in terms of animacy, it is optionally marked. The fact
that it is not definite, adds to the likelihood that it is not marked in this example.

‘a jaguar like this, on this side a jaguar was standing across, I found a jaguar
standing across (the path)’
Inanimate nouns are also more likely to be marked when definite, as in the
following examples (definite: (65) vs. indefinite: (66)). Note also that Kakua does
not have dedicated definite articles, and that having a pronoun preceding the noun
serves as definiteness marking:̃̌

Demonstratives are a type of expression which is always definite. They are
thus often marked for object case when in object argument function. Examples are
given in (67)-(70):

Examples (35)-(37) above raise various interesting questions. One concerns
the marking of object case on both the relative clause and the head noun. Probably
this marking on both elements is a formal distinction that, in addition to the use of
the subordinator marker -ni ~ -nit, helps to identify relatives clauses from other types
of subordinate clauses. Or maybe the marking of object case on both the relative
clause and the head noun can be interpreted as an apposition of a headless relative
clause and the noun to which it refers (headless relative + head N. See examples of
headless relative clauses below).
Another interesting construction of relative clauses is that shown in example
(37). This is an internally headed relative clause, which illustrates yet another
strategy of relative clause formation. Kakua can thus be said to have externally
headed relative clauses, internally headed relative clauses, headless relative clauses,
and (maybe) the apposition of the relative clause and the head noun.
Future research on these different subordinating constructions will
undoubtedly provide us with very enriching typological information of subordination
strategies in the languages of the area.
Kakua frequently uses headless relative clauses. Thus, the subordinate clause
occurs on its own and, as other relative clauses, usually precedes the predicate of the
main clause. Examples of headless relative clauses are given below. Note that
perhaps because of the lack of a head NP, in this type of headless relative clauses,
the subordinate clause seems to also be able to function as an argument of the main
clause (to function as a complement clause). Headless relative clauses are, by
definition, arguments of the main clause; thus, finding a formal difference between
headless relative and complement clauses can help to set these constructions apart in
Kakua. Possibly, a formal difference is the presence of the subordinator particle -ni
~ -nit ‘SUBR’. This formal distinction will help to describe examples like the ones in
(39)-(41) below, but does not account for the headless relative in (38) which lacks
the subordinator suffix. A rigorous evaluation of the different types of subordinate
clauses and their strict formal distinctions awaits further research:362 A Grammar of Kakua

Finally, it must be stated that this work has not undertaken a careful test on
what arguments within the relative clause can be relativized, and for this reason I
have not provided a description of arguments that may or may not be relativized
(whether or not the relativized noun can be the subject, object, or oblique, or any
other within the relative clause).","[381, 382, 383]"
"13.5 Complement clauses
A complement clause is commonly defined as a clause that functions as a core
argument of the predicate of the main clause (c.f., Givón 2001:39, Dixon 2006:1540, Noonan 1985:46, 2007: 52). Predicates that can take a complement clause,
instead of an NP, as their argument, are commonly verbs that encode meanings of,
e.g., say, believe, wish, know, see, hear, tell (Noonan 2007). These type of predicatesComplex Clauses359are commonly called ‘complement-taking predicates’ or ‘CTPs’ (e.g. by Noonan
2007:53).
In Kakua, common CTPs are verbs like nih ‘say’, nǎwɁ ‘tell’, and hêjɁnahǔj
‘think/believe’ (from hêjɁ ‘know’ and hǔj ‘listen/understand’). Complement clauses
in Kakua do not take special subordinating morphology (i.e., a complementizer
particle). Syntactically, complement clauses are most typically embedded within the
main clause:
30) fǐt [Iginio tew-bǔpʧew-ni=na=ka]
1PL Iginio work-have.flu-ADJVZ=DECL=ASSfĩ=niɁ1PL=not.knowhêjɁnahǔj-kan=bethink-NEG=REC.PST
‘we didn’t think [that Iginio was sick]’ (with dengue)Although the complement clause tends to be embedded within the main
clause, alternative orders can also be found. Consider example (31), referring to a
child who is in her crawling stage, perhaps about to walk. In (31) the complement
clause occurs following the main clause. The alternative order in (32) is also accepted
by speakers.

"5 This is a distinct group from the Bará people, speakers of an Eastern Tukanoan language of theVaupés, spoken in the Pirá-Paraná region. The etymology of this ethnonym is not clear4A Grammar of KakuaThe Kakua people have been locally referred to as Makú de Cubeo, Makú de
Desano, or Makú de Wanano, or generally as ‘Makú’. In the literature, they have
also been referenced as Bará (Silverwood-Cope, 1972) and as Cacua.
The term ‘Makú’ has been used by the River people in the Vaupés region to
refer to any forest-dwelling group of people, or people from the forest in general,
regardless of their ethnicity or language (c.f., Jackson 1983:149, and other
discussions found in Ospina 2002 for Yuhup, and Epps 2008 for Hup. See also V.
Martins 2005 on reference to the ‘eastern Makú’ branch, and Mahecha et al. 199697 on additional discussion of the term Makú. Epps & Bolaños submitted, offer also
discussion of the term Makú used as a linguistic classification to group many
unrelated forest-dweller peoples). The term Makú in itself has a very strong
pejorative connotation, and is even used as an insult among peoples in the region.
The term probably has an Arawak origin with the meaning of ‘those who do not talk’
or ‘do not speak’ (e.g. Arawak Baniwa-Curripaco ma-aku ‘NEG-speak’; see KochGrünberg 1906:877; see also discussions in Martins & Martins 1999: 251, Ramirez
2001a:198, Epps & Bolaños submitted. See also Ospina 2002:16 for alternative
suggestions on the origin of the ‘Makú’ term).
As opposed to the ‘forest people’, the ‘river people’ live along the main rivers
or main streams and cultivate large agricultural fields (compared to that of the
Makú’s). Their protein sources are obtained primarily from fishing, and this has
made them experienced river navigators able to face the wild rapids of the Vaupés
River.
Forest people, in turn, are expert navigators of the land. They are perceived
as quick and silent in the forest and able to face long nights walking and sleeping in
the forest without being noticed by the river peoples. Their experience with water,
however, is less developed and constantly invites mockery from the river peoples.
Forest people are both feared and looked down upon by River peoples.
Because they are considered to be socially inferior, they are hardly considered worth
referring to. However, because of their astuteness when dealing with the inhospitable
forest, the same river people who look at them with pity, fear them as well.
Because the Kakua people have relied strongly on hunting and gathering for
their subsistence they are also called ‘Makú’ (as mentioned, the term ‘Makú’ is
applied to all the hunting-gathering forest peoples of the region). Different from most
of their neighbors, peoples from Eastern Tukanoan and Arawak speaking groups, the
Kakua peoples have a highly mobile lifestyle, engaging in long trekking, and hunting
trips that can last from one day to many months. Additionally, family groups often
organize trips to visit other family members either to the village of Nuevo Pueblo,
or to inland places where they spend time together, hunting and gathering forest
goods. These trips may last a few months, or even years.
The connotations of the term ‘Makú’ is thus negative now and as far as we
know has always been so. In the broader social context of Colombia, being
indigenous is synonymous to being an inferior person, poor and naïve. Calling
someone an Indian in the urban context has very negative overtones. When
indigenous peoples in the Colombian Vaupés become aware of the social
embarrassment entailed in being indigenous, they claim not to be so, replying oftenIntroduction: Kakua and its speakers5that the ‘Makú’ people are the real Indians, and not them (“indio yo? no, indios los
Makú, yo no!”).
I have also witnessed a fight among children in an Eastern Tukanoan village
of Desanos, where the ultimate insult culminating the fight was when one of the
children involved called the other one ‘Makú’, reinforcing his insult saying “you are
just like those Kakua savages!”
Likewise, in many of my trips to the area, whenever I have told people that I
frequently visit the Kakua people, I am questioned with high astonishment: why do
I want to visit forest people? and what is really so interesting about them? The
implication is as if they were almost animal-like creatures.
When I first visited the Kakua village of Nuevo Pueblo, I was greeted by the
Kakua in the Desano language.6 When I replied back speaking in Kakua people
looked at me with disbelief and insisted a few more times in Desano. Once it was
clear to them that I could not understand a word of Desano, the first person
addressing me stepped back and with a look of unpleasant surprise on her face she
asked again, this time in Kakua, “are you really understanding our language? Can
you really not understand the language of the patrons?”. This seems to have been a
big disappointment not only for the Kakua people, but for the Desano people as well.
Many times during my stays in Nuevo Pueblo I was addressed in Desano, and people
seemed not to be able to get over the fact that I could not speak Desano but was
trying to make my way into Kakua.
Finally, from my own observations in the Tukano village of Piracuara at the
basin of the Papurí River, the Hup people –also considered Makú, and with whom
the Kakua people of Nuevo Pueblo have social relationships and even some cases of
intermarriage– represent the more numerous population in the village. Nonetheless,
the Tukanoans maintain control and make primary decisions in this village. At the
local school, children are given meals twice daily during the school program. The
Hup children will only eat after the Tukanoan children have already eaten and been
served. This serves as a good illustration of the lower class position of the ‘Makú’
people vis à vis their regional neighbors.
These experiences are not very different from what has been documented in
the ethnographic literature of the peoples of the area. For example, Jackson
(1983:159) mentions specific cases when the ‘Makú’ are referred to as animal-like
creatures.
The ‘Makú’ people overall are considered to have a socially inferior status,
and their socio-economic relationship with the other indigenous groups of the area
(Eastern Tukanoans and Arawak groups) is clearly unbalanced.
6 The Kakua people of Nuevo Pueblo have had intense contact interactions with the Desanopeople in the nearby village of Wainambí. In fact, people from Wainambí may ‘make use’ of the Kakuas
as they wish. If the Desano people are in need of force of labor, for example, they don’t ask for a favor
from the Kakua; instead, they demand the number of Kakua people that they need and give them directions
on what to do. Kakua people from Nuevo Pueblo refer to the Desano people from Wainambí as their
patrons.","[25, 26, 27]"

A few examples above have illustrated the declarative occuring with the
marker of assertion =ka (e.g., (46), (48), and (50)), this serves to illustrate how
clauses with the illocution marker for declarative can be further specified for
modality.
Likewise, the declarative marker can also occur in sentences marked with the
reported evidential. This is the only evidential category with which the declarative
can co-occur (be it marked by the reportative enclitic =wɨt ‘REP.EVID’, or with the
second-hand evidential prefix t- ~ ti- ‘EVID’, as long as the sentence represents
reported information. Sentences of inferred evidentiality cannot contain the
declarative marker.8 See §10.6 below for a description of the different evidentiality
distinctions). The following examples illustrate the occurrence of the declarative in
reportative sentences:

‘She asked them, where are you all going?’
I believe that one possible explanation for this is that perhaps the inferred evidentiality category
reduces somehow the degree of assertion of a situation. The situation is more likely to be asserted if the
speaker has either full commitment towards the veracity of it, or if the commitment towards the veracity
of the situation falls completely onto someone else. Thus, if the sentence is marked for reported
evidentiality, the responsibility of what is being asserted is not entirely on the speaker’s behalf, but on
somebody else’s. An inferred statement, on the other hand, implies the speaker’s own inferences as regards
the situation and may compromise her reputation if the situation is asserted based on inferred grounds.
This may also serve as another argument suggesting that the declarative marker has some kind of
evidential function.

The ability of the declarative marker to occur in reportative sentences is

environments in which a declarative marker can occur. 9 More discussion of
declarative clauses is found in Chapter 12.","[304, 305, 306]"
"3.1.1 Identifying affixes and clitics
A property common to affixes and clitics is that there are no pauses in
between these formatives and their hosts. The main syntactic characteristic that
differentiates affixes from clitics in Kakua is that clitics, unlike affixes, can attach to
different hosts. The ‘freedom of host selection’ is a defining characteristic of
prototypical clitics cross-linguistically (cf. Bickel & Nichols 2007: 174, see also
Haspelmath & Sims 2010: 197ff.). Affixes, on the other hand, have a much more
restricted syntactic distribution and are, for the most part, exclusive to a particular98A Grammar of Kakuaparts of speech. An overview of some of the clitic morphemes and their hosts is

Some morphemes, described here as clitics (such as the case of the clitic=buh ‘action from far’, which encodes the meaning of an action that is performed
from a distance far from the actor) do not satisfy the criteria of freedom of hostTypes of morphemes and word classes99selection. However, they are still being described as clitics here, because they occur
after a string of clitic positions of their host. Thus, describing them as affixes would
fail to account for the identity of the morphemes (clitics) which precede these set of
clitics which do not have freedom of host selection.
The status of case markers as clitics vs. affixes will be discussed in some
detail here, as one example how clitics can be distinguished from affixes in Kakua.
Case markers have freedom of host selection in that they attach to nouns and
adjectives (which share some, but not all characteristics of nouns, see section 3.3.5).
On the other hand, case markers may only occur on verbs if these are in the
subordinate clause (see Chapter 12 for a description of subordinate clauses in
Kakua). Case markers also display a greater freedom of movement than affixes in
two further respects. Firstly, they can occur on only one element of the noun phrase,
rather than on each individual elements of the noun phrase (examples (4)-(8), which
can be the second (4)-(6) or the first element (7).

(long ago when the eclipse was passing) they asked the dead cadaver’ (Spanish
‘el cadaver finado’)Affixes, unlike any other type of morpheme in Kakua (this includes clitics
and all of the word classes), can have syllables without onsets (see Table 3.3 below),
or consist of just a consonant (Table 3.4). Also, only affixes can have unspecified
vowels in their underlying structure. Thus, they allow for the copying of the vowel
quality of the host to which they attach. As mentioned above, affixes do not have
freedom of host selection. A list illustrating some representative examples of suffixes
in Kakua and their hosts is given in Table 3.3 below:

violate the phonological restriction in Kakua that disallows consonant clusters. Note
that exceptions to phonological restrictions in Kakua occur for other affixes as well
(e.g. vowel copying and the onset-less syllables mentioned above). In what follows
of this section, I present a set of three enclitics that can attach to various word classes
to express emphasis or intensity of that constituent. These forms are: = jǔb, which
serves as an intensifier to nouns, with the semantic meaning of ‘truly’, or ‘really’.
Example (9) illustrates this verb root jǔb ‘be true’, from which this intensifier
derives, occurring within a verbal construction. Example (10) shows the function of
=jǔb as an intensifier of a pronoun:

are full of the intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ. Its meaning is that of an affirmation
such as ‘truly’ or ‘exactly’. This intensifier =ti can also occur with both, nouns and
verbs:̌ ʔ=hĩ=tiʔ

The intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ occurs commonly in interrogative clauses,
with interrogative pronouns and question words, and in adverbial particles such as

Nouns and verbs conform the two open classes of words in Kakua.
The elements of the open word classes in Kakua have, in principle, an
unlimited membership. That is to say, the open classes of words in Kakua may
include not only native words, but also readily accept borrowings, calques, and any
other type of new lexical items such as words newly formed by semantic extensions
or by the lexicalization of formerly more complex words (e.g., historical compounds
that have undergone morphological and/or phonological fusion to form one complex
lexical item).
The main element of the members of open classes is a noun or verb root that
heads the noun or verb phrase accordingly.
Roots can be further divided into those that can occur as free elements and
those that are obligatorily bound with inflectional or derivational morphology
(Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the different free and obligatorily bound noun roots. Verb
are described in Chapters 8 and 9).
In this study a free morpheme is understood as an element that is
phonologically independent, i.e. it is not obligatorily bound to another free
morpheme or to other bound morphology in order to form a full word.
A major distinction between Kakua noun and verb roots concerns the
morphology each of these requires. Kakua nouns are formed by a free root that can
occur without the need of additional morphology. Verbs, on the other hand, require
for the most part a more complex morphology.
The main semantic, phonological, syntactic and morphological characteristics
of Kakua nouns and verbs are described in the following subsections. Subsection
§3.2.1 describes these main characteristics that define Kakua nouns. §3.2.2 deals
with the main properties that characterize verbs.","[119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"7.5QuantifiersIn addition to numerals, Kakua has other morphemes that express quantity.
These are: tâwʔ ‘sometimes’, tak ‘be.middle/half’, niʔat ‘all/every’, lâ ‘times/era’,
dawǎ ‘many’, and henaʔ ‘this much/count/measure’. These terms can act like
modifiers of nouns (or adverbials) in noun phrases, or can also occur by themselves
as the head of a noun phrase functioning as quantifiers. Examples of these
morphemes expressing quantity are given below:

‘Today we are going to calculate (measure) the weather, they said’7.6The emphasis marker =bǔThe Kakua enclitic =bǔ is a polysemous morpheme. It serves as a locative
case marker (encoding physical and temporal location), as illustrated again in
examples (54) and (55) below (see section §6.4.1 in Chapter 6 for a description of
locative case marking):

particular participant in an event. A contrast between the locative use of this marker
and its emphatic use can be seen by comparing (54) and (55) above to the example
in (56) below.

The two meanings of this form are undoubtedly related and probably
historically derive from one morpheme; i.e. =bǔ underwent, or is undergoing, a
semantic extension, and also developed different distributions: one occurs with
subjects whereas the other (locative) cannot. The direction of this semantic extension
(or semantic shift) would probably have been from physical location which became
associated, over time, with the ‘location’ of a participant within the discourse,
following the cross-linguistically the common pathway from a concrete spatial
meaning to other more abstract meanings (e.g., of time or discourse relevance).
Whichever the direction might be, the semantic extension, or shift, of =bǔ
developed with a functional motivation, in which either a physical location became

The noun: morphology and structure
4.0IntroductionThis chapter describes the morphology of nouns and the syntactic position of
morphemes in the noun word.
Most of Kakua nouns are formed by monosyllabic (at most bisyllabic) roots
(c.f., §2.3, Chapter 2, on the syllabic structure of morphemes in Kakua); morphemes
with three or more syllables are exceptional and in most cases are lexical borrowings.
Kakua has a set of free and bound noun roots. A free noun root in Kakua can
be sufficient as a minimal nominal word; i.e., without need of additional morphology,
a bare noun root can function as head of a noun phrase, as an argument of a verb or
postposition, and also as a nominal modifier.
Kakua nouns can be specified for number, shape, possession, case, and
definiteness.
Nouns in Kakua do not take prefixes, and with the exception of proclitics, all
of the noun morphology in Kakua, as is the case for many Amazonian languages
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2012: 131), occurs exclusively after the stem. According to
Aikhenvald (2012:131), it seems to be a fairly common cross-linguistic tendency that
in predominantly suffixing languages, cross-referencing person-marking markers
will be the only morphology occurring in a pre-stem position. In the case of Kakua,
in which morphology is predominantly post-stem, the number of prefixes is very
limited (only two prefixing slots), and the cross-referencing person-marking markers
occur as proclitics.
Semantically, the elements belonging to the word class of nouns in Kakua
denote animate and inanimate entities, including abstract concepts, substances,
names (like proper and place names), natural and ecological phenomena, among
others.
This chapter is subdivided as follows: Section §4.1 introduces a description
of the two general types of nouns in Kakua: free and bound nouns. A template of the
noun in Kakua and its morphological categories, such as case, number, and
classification, is described in §4.2. This chapter ends with a description on the
different types of nominalization strategies in Kakua in section §4.3.","[147, 148, 149]"
"Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality26910.1.2 General past -Vp
The suffix -Vp is here described as a ‘general past’ marker because it encodes
the semantics of a situation that occurs at a time prior to the time of speech.
Additionally, Kakua makes deictic time distinctions in past tenses, i.e. the recent past
=be (§10.1.2) and the remote past =hĩ (§10.1.3). These enclitics usually occur in
addition to the general past suffix (though not obligatorily). The general past suffix
immediately follows the verb stem, and, unlike the other markers of past distinctions,
occurs with verb stems only. The suffix itself has an unspecified vowel, where the
identity of the vowel in the past marker is copied from the vowel of the verb stem
to which it attaches. Examples of this marker combining with the recent past =be
are presented in (1)-(3) below:

construction such as the elicited example shown in (4) below, involving present time
reference and the general past marker -Vp, accepted by speakers:

Note that it can also occur without any further specification of deictic time

this (see also example (5) above):

‘we went chasing wild pigs, indeed’10.1.3 Recent past =be
The enclitic =be indicates that the event or state encoded by the predicate
occurred at a past moment no more than one year ago. This time range, however, is
not very strict, e.g. when it’s being used in relation to some other longer time period.
In most cases, the recent past enclitic (like the remote past enclitic) co-occurs with
the general past suffix –Vp (as in examples (1)-(3) above). However, sometimes the
recent past enclitic also occurs without the general past suffix, and in elicitation both
options were accepted. The rules allowing for the omission of the general past suffix
are still unclear. An example of the recent past enclitic occurring without the general
past suffix is given below. Note that the verb ʔǔʔ ‘dream’ is followed by the
declarative enclitic, and the general past is not suffixed to the verb. Although
examples of this type are not as frequent as the co-occurrence of the general past +
recent past markers, they are not rare either.

freedom of host selection. Example (10) shows the attachment of the recent past
enclitic to a verb, while the examples below show its occurrence with pronouns:

‘I took (the wasai) and gave to my daughter, granddad!’10.1.4 Remote past =hĩ
The enclitic =hĩ indicates that the event or state encoded by the predicate
occurs at a past time moment that is considered remote. Usually, whenever the event
or state occurred more than one year before the time of speech, the remote past
enclitic is used. The remote past enclitic is commonly used in narratives of myths of
origin, or in bedtime stories for children. But it is also used when referring to a time
in the past of a person’s life. Some examples are presented below:

in the majority of cases together with the general past suffix. However I have also
found cases in which the remote past enclitic does not co-occur with the general past
marker (although even fewer cases than recent past enclitics without general past
suffixes). Examples of this are shown below (see also (15) above):272A Grammar of Kakua16) tɨ ̃̂=diʔ

As in the case with the recent past enclitic, the remote past enclitic can occur
with hosts other than the predicate. Example (19) shows the enclitic (together with
the reported evidential =wɨt) encliticized to a pronoun:

The suffix -bip indicates situations that are to occur in the future. As with the
distinctions of past tense, future tenses can refer to an immediate future (shown in
§10.1.5 below), or to a future that is not necessarily immediate. This last one is
encoded with the suffix -bip, and can refer to any future that is not immediate. A
few examples are presented below:

The suffix -min encodes the immediate future, and is used for events that are
about to happen. It is used quite frequently with verbs of saying and telling. However,
it is not restricted to such verbs. In elicitation, the suffix was accepted whenever
encoding an event or state that is to occur in the immediate future. When the time
reference is other than immediate future, the use of the immediate future suffix –min
‘IMM.FUT’, is not grammatical.

10.2.0 Introduction
Kakua has three forms that encode aspectual meanings. These forms, their
semantics, and their morphosyntactic positions are presented in Table 10.2. Note that
all three forms have different morphosyntactic positions. The habitual marker is
strictly a prefix. The telic marker is strictly a suffix, while the progressive marker
usually forms a predicate of its own, occurring either as a particle (detached) from
the predicate construction, or taking also a cross-referencing proclitic and other
verbal morphology, like any other verb. The possible etymology of the progressive
marker is discussed below.","[289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294]"
"Basic clause structure and types of clauses337Imperatives can also be used to give commands to other than a 2 nd person
(singular or plural) participants. This is done by adding the appropriate proclitic
pronoun in the imperative construction:
97) mi=Ɂên-é
3SG.F=see=IMP
‘may she see!’
98) mi=têw-é
3SG.F=work=IMP
‘may she work!’
Constituent order in imperative clauses is somewhat different from that in
declarative clauses. Imperative clauses do have a verb final order. But if the subject
argument is fully expressed by an NP, then the subject argument most often
immediately precedes the verb. It then follows the object rather than preceding it as
in other clauses, with an OSV order as the result. The fronting of the object argument
in an imperative clause is not an uncommon cross-linguistic feature of imperatives
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97). This ordering of imperative clauses in Kakua is
illustrated in examples (99)-(101) below:
99) kan=diʔ měm
3SG=OBJ 2SG
‘leave it!’ma= fwẽh-é2SG=leave-IMP100) bab-ni=diʔ

2SG
‘you come stand by me!’ma=ɲɨʔ-hɨwʔ-ɨ ̃́2SGma=dúk-ú2SG=sift-IMP2SG=stand-come-IMPThe only evidentiality marker that can occur in combination with imperative
clauses in Kakua is the reported evidential =wɨt, possibly together with the prefix
t- ‘EVID’ (prefix of second hand, nonsensorial evidentiality. See Chapter 10 on
evidentiality) to express that the order has been given by someone other than the
speaker. The use of the reported evidential marker usually serves also to attenuate
the force of the command, making it a more polite imperative. This is often used
when directing orders to elders (102)-(103). Note that the additional evidentiality
specification forms a separate clause, so cannot be directly combined with the
imperative verb:338A Grammar of Kakua102) ma=tʃɨd-ɨ ̃́,

‘take (the manioc) out for grating, it is said’nih=wɨt=hĩsay=REP.EVID=REM.PSTIn fact, imperative clauses in Kakua lack all TAME distinctions in the clause
itself, and all of these distinctions form a separate clause. Cross-linguistically
speaking, this is not an uncommon characteristic of imperative clauses (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985).
An additional construction expressing imperative solicits the addressee to
perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The form of this imperative is
-áʔbuhú and it is glossed here as ‘IMP2’. In constructions using this morpheme, the
subject is always a second person, and its overt expression may be omitted. See
examples (104)-(105) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’. This
form can only code a ‘beneficial’ imperative, and no other benefactive or dative like
meanings can be drawn from it.

105) kǎn=diʔ ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
3SGM=OBJ take.out-IMP2
‘take (it) out for him’
Synchronically, -áʔbuhú is considered here to be one single morpheme.
However, because of the phonological (syllabic structure, vowel harmony) structure
of Kakua words, it is likely that that -áʔbuhú is historically at least a complex form.
The etymology of this imperative is not transparent.6
It might be a lexicalized combination of a morpheme -áʔ and the directional clitic=buh ‘DIR’.
The first element could be a phonologically reduced form of the negative suffix -kan, or it might
correspond to a morpheme that is no longer used in synchronic Kakua. Note that the negative suffix
doesn’t support a semantic motivation for this ‘beneficial’ imperative. Perhaps, the source of the proposed
first element -áɁ, expressed similar semantics of performing an action on behalf of a third party.
Nonetheless, there is no evidence neither in Kakua nor in its sister language Nɨkak that allows me to
strongly claim this hypothesis. The second element of this form would be the directional clitic =buh
‘DIR’, displaying the addition of a reduplicated vowel and high tone, i.e. the regular way to form
imperatives -Ṽ́. I propose the directional clitic as the most likely source of this element in this imperative
marker because of the semantics of this clitic, which comes from a verb root meaning ‘to perform an
action from a distance’ (see note at the end of Chapter 8 regarding the fuzzy verbal-directional identity
6Basic clause structure and types of clauses33912.12 Negative imperative
Negative imperative clauses require the negative imperative suffix -kabuhú.
This is also clearly a complex morpheme, historically derived from at least two
morphemes. The first part of this morpheme can be identified as the negative suffix
marker -kan/-kap. The second part, however, is less clear, and can have at least two
interpretations. Firstly, it may relate to the directional clitic =buh ‘DIR’, or to the
emphasis function of the clitic =bǔ ‘EMPH’ (see Chapter 8), plus a reduplication of
its vowel. As for now, I have no strong evidence for either of these hypotheses, but
what is clear is that (as with the second imperative described in §12.11 above), given
Kakua’s phonological and morphological rules, this particular negative imperative
morpheme can be considered historically as a complex form.
The negative imperative morpheme must immediately follow the verb root
(to which no affirmative imperative can be attached): (PN)=Verb-kabuhú :
106) ma=ʔɨm-kabuhú
2SG=be.afraid-NEG.IMPER
‘don’t be afraid!’of this morpheme). Thus, performing on behalf, or for the benefit of somebody else can be equated to
performing an action from a distance. Whenever the clause refers to this specific semantics of performing
an action for the benefit of somebody else, the imperative is expressed with this obscure morpheme
-áʔbuhú, thus it is considered here as one single complex morpheme. In constructions using this
morpheme, the subject argument of the clause is always in the second person, and it may be omitted. See
examples (i)-(ii) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’:
(i)
ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ
nih-áʔbuhú

(ii)

3SGM=OBJ
take.out-IMP2
‘take (it) out for him’
Since it seems to have a beneficial encoding (perform for the benefit of someone else), the following
considerations might be relevant for a future study of this imperative: i) Kakua does not have a dedicatedmarker for benefactive roles (see discussion in Chapter 6), ii) many Vaupés languages also do not have
dedicated markers for benefactive roles; iii) Kakua does not have a dative case marker (another possiblesource for the development of a benefactive encoding of a form). If the source were a dative case marker,however, it would be necessary to explain why and how a case marker becomes a verbal morpheme; iv)
many Vaupés languages have been described to lack a dative marker; v) Nɨkak, Kakua’s sister language,has been described as making five case distinctions, among which a dative; vi) Kakua, as many of its
neighboring groups in the Vaupés, makes three morphological distinctions, for case: Object arguments,Locatives, and Comitative and Instrumental; vii) Nɨkak’s dative marker is -éʔ (see Mahecha 2009); viii)
there is a regular sound correspondence of Nɨkak /e/ to Kakua /a/. This may be relevant for the complexbenefactive imperative form in Kakua -áʔbuhú; ix) because of Kakua’s phonological (syllabic structure,
vowel harmony) and morphological rules, we know that -áʔbuhú imperative is a complex form.","[357, 358, 359, 360]"
"2.1.3 Phonotactics of vowels
This subsection summarizes the distribution and restrictions of Kakua’s
vowels.
The syllabic structure of Kakua roots is such that unexceptionally they must
have an onset (see §2.2 below for a description of syllable structure). Thus, since
roots of the type VC or V are not allowed, vowels do not occur in root initial position.
Only suffixes can have syllabic structures o the type VC. In these type of suffixes,
any vowel of Kakua’s vowel inventory may occur in initial position.
Vowel sequences do not appear to be a regular feature in the phonology of
Kakua. Only a very limited number of vowel sequences have been found in the
current lexical database, these are shown in (6) below. Note that many of these
sequences also have /o/:
6) a.
b.

[hoa] ‘down river’
[mbua] ‘heal’
[dʒôaʔ] ‘clean front yard’
[hò̃̀áʔ] ‘meet’
[tôaʔ] ‘approach’
[ʔuat] ‘untangle a knot’
[ʔũat] ‘prick with a finger into a small hole’
[koatá] ‘white fronted spider monkey’ (Ateles belzebuth sp)A diachronic evaluation of these words may help explain these unusual
sequences of vowels in Kakua. The word for ‘finish’ for example, pêa, illustrated in
(6) above has a similar meaning and at least part of the phonological form of the
verb pê ‘be last’. It might be that Kakua pêa ‘finish’ derived from a compound of
the element pê ‘be last’ and another postponed element (suffix, clitic, or root) that
got lexicalized resulting in what is today considered one lexical word with an unusual
sequence of vowels.
Additionally, for forms like koatá ‘spider monkey, sp’, in (5) and (1) above,
may best be explained as a borrowing (see comment above).
Vowel length is not a phonemic feature of Kakua’s vowel inventory. Vowel
length consistently occurs as a phonetic process in open syllables, especially in wordfinal positions /CV/ [CV:]:
7)/ʧɨ ̂/[ʧɨ ̂:]‘pineapple’28A Grammar of Kakua8)/jǔ
měm=tiɁ
hépaʔ=ni/
armadillo 2SG=INTS
answer=S.S
‘Armadillo (nick name), you answer’[ʤǔ: měm=tiɁ hépaʔ=ni:]More sporadically, phonetic vowel lengthening also occurs in closed syllables
with voiced obstruents and glides as codas /CVC +Glide/ [CV:C+Glide]~ [CV:C+Glide];
/CVC+voice/ [CV:C+voice] ~ [CV:C+voice]. This last instance of phonetic vowel
lengthening in /CVC/ syllables occurs with variation among speakers. Thus, words
such as /bûd/ ‘cut’ may be realized both as [bû:dn] or [bûdn]. Likewise, words
involving glides, such as /hǔj/, may be realized both as [hǔj] or [hǔ:j].
In the previous version of Kakua phonology of 2010, I included a set of three
lexical elements where glides combined to form a diphthong. These were shown in
(9) below:
9)a. /hja/
[hj ̀a]
b. /hjat/ [hj ̀at̚]
̀̃̂
c. /~dĵat/ [njãt]‘forest’
‘place where light is reflected’
‘everything/everybody’Since then, I reevaluate two of these three forms, and present a different
representation as shown in (10) below:
10) a. /hja/
b. /hǐ-at/
c. /~dîɁat/[hj ̀a]
‘forest’
[hjǎt] (light.up-NMLZ) ‘place where light is reflected’
[nîɁãt] ‘everything/everybody’Note that for the set above, only the word for ‘forest’ hja, remains as an
exception (alternatively, this could also have been diachronically hi-a, where -a
might have once been a suffix of some kind, now lost). The word for ‘a place where
light is reflected’ was reevaluated and it was concluded that it was in fact a compound
of the verb hǐ ‘to light up’ and the nominalizer suffix -at. Likewise, a more careful
phonetic analisis of the word for ‘everyting/everybody’, unvealed a glottal voiceless
occlusive that was previously not detected. The form is then reassessed and instead
of the form /~dĵat/, I now correct it to /~dîɁat/, where there is no diphthong for this
word.","[49, 50]"
"Phonology 71
Example in (105) below illustrates the three contrastive tones in Kakua in
monosyllabic words with identical segments:
105) /L/:
/HL/:
/LH/:̀̃
/ L~ba/ [mà:]
HL
/ ~ba/ [mẫ:]
̀̃
/ LH~ba/ [mǎ:]‘dig out dirt leaving dirt by the side of’
‘be old/wood’
‘leader’Bisyllabic morphemes with contour tones could be analyzed as sequences of
H-L, or L-H. However, accepting this as the phonemic tonal contrast for bisyllabic
morphemes would create a more complex and more restricted tonal system in which
monosyllabic morphemes would behave differently than bisyllabic ones. Note in this
context that the [L] portion of a /HL/ contour tone blocks further spreading of the
[H] portion of the contour, showing that the [L] tone in the contour is active, blocking
spreading.
The way I argue to account for the phonetic realization of contour tones in
bisyllabic morphemes is to assume the morpheme as the domain of tone. Hence, in
the presence of contour tones, the contour is accommodated on the syllable receiving
the highest peak of the contour, while the other syllable will hold the low pitch of
the contour. Thus, a HL [falling] tone is typically accommodated on the first portion
of the (bysillabic) morpheme and drifts down towards the end of the morpheme,
being audibly perceived as a HL-L melody.16
Likewise, in the presence of a LH [rising] tonal morpheme, the lowest peak
of the LH contour is accommodated on the first portion (i.e., syllable) of the –
bysillabic- morpheme gradually rising towards the end of the morpheme where the
highest peak occurs. Consider the following phonetic representations below for
bysillabic morphemes:
106) Morpheme level tonal distinction
/LH/
/LH hewe/
[hèwě] ‘a moving unspecified entity’
/HL/
/ HL hewe/
[hêwè] ‘be open’
/L/
/ L hewe /
[hèwè] ‘a clearing in the forest’
16 Describing the phonetic realization of contour tones in this way may be compatible with adescription of Kakua as a language with a word-accent system. Pitch, accent, and stress is not describedin this phonological description of Kakua, primarily because of the limitations on providing a robust
analysis of these phonological phenomena. It is important, however, to highlight that other languages ofthe region (like Hup, for example, see Epps 2008), have been described as having a kind of pitch-accentsystem, in which each word receives stress, and tone is realized on the stressed syllable. The unstressedsyllable in these type of systems is not assigned any tone, which means that it is phonetically pronouncedas a [L] tone. This is an attractive analysis for Kakua since, it would allow to propose that in the presence
of a contour tone, the stressed syllable attracts the [H] portion, while the unstressed syllable attracts the[L] tone, accounting in this way for the peculiar feature that HL occurs only on the first syllable while
LH occurs only on the second. This analysis would involve analyzing tone as a feature linked to a stress
property rather than as a property of the morpheme.","[92, 93]"
"Chapter 3
Types of morphemes and word classes
3.0IntroductionThis chapter presents an overview of the major word classes in Kakua. These
are divided into open classes and closed classes of words. The defining grammatical
features of these word classes are established by syntactic, semantic, and
morphological criteria. The word classes in Kakua include nouns, verbs, a small set
of adjectives, a small group of adverbs, a group of particles, and a large number of
grammatical, bound morphemes.
The intricateness of Kakua’s grammar is due, for the most part, to its
morphological complexity. Kakua morphology is highly affixing; most affixes are
post-stem (suffixes), as is characteristic of the languages spoken in the Vaupés
linguistic area (c.f., Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999, Payne 1990, Aikhenvald 2002b,
2012). Prefixing occurs in the verb phrase only and the number of prefixes in Kakua
is far less than that of suffixes (see Chapter 8). Compounding in Kakua occurs very
productively as a strategy of derivation, possession, or as a strategy to form new
(lexical) meanings.
The verb morphology in Kakua is by far more complex than the morphology
of nouns, regarding both inflection and derivation (cf., Chapter 8). A detailed
discussion of inflection and word class-changing derivational processes related to a
specific part of speech can be found in later chapters where for each part a thorough
description is given.
Kakua syntax, on the other hand, is more simple and straightforward. The
preferred order is SOV, although alternative orders are often allowed (see Chapter
12).
The word in Kakua consists of roots (at least one is obligatory) plus other
optional elements such as prefixes, a large number of derivational and inflectional
suffixes, and other formatives, such as clitics. Some discourse-related morphemes,
namely particles serving as intensifiers, or adverbial particles, also cliticize to
preceding hosts. For an overview of the definition of the Kakua word see Section
§3.1 below.
The first aim of the present chapter is to offer an overview of the main types
of morphemes of Kakua. Note that this chapter provides only a basic description of
the main concepts that help define Kakua’s parts of speech and different
morphological categories. Secondly, this chapter describes Kakua’s open and closed
word classes. Open and closed word classes in Kakua differ in that open word classes
admit new items, whereas the closed classes, on the other hand, strongly resist the
introduction of new items.","[115, 116, 117]"
"Phonology 892.3.2.4 Exceptional casesAs stated in the introduction of this section, every lexical morpheme
(excluding toneless affixes and clitics) must be specified for tone, and each
morpheme must have one, and only one, tone. The corpus of my data shows only
two exceptions where two tones co-occur within the same morpheme:
114) / LH+HL ʧaa/
/ LH+HL ~ʧeeʔ/[ʧǎâ]
̀̃
[ʧěễʔ]‘lung’
‘sardine sp’A plausible hypothesis is that these two tone-compounded forms are derived
from a compounding of morphemes with different tone distinctions that fused into a
single morpheme. However, the source from which these forms might have been
derived is not clear and at this point I will limit myself to simply mentioning these
two exceptional cases.
Figure 2.38. Tone compounding.
/ LH+HL ʧaa/
[ʧǎâ] ‘lung’2.3.3 Other possible analysis for the description of tone
Regarding the tonal inventory an alternative analysis can be proposed where
instead of the three tonal distinctions presented here as HL, LH and L, only the
contour tones were part of the tonal system (i.e., only HL and LH), and what is being
analyzed as L tone could be, instead, described as a zero tone or atonal. 22 This
alternative analysis would have to account for the contexts, or constrains, that
22 Note that in Daw there is also HL and LH and [L], with [L] understood as atonal, and theatonal analysis is supported historically in that contour tones appear to have arisen where there were long
vowels, while short vowels maintained the atonal value (S. Martins 2004).","[110, 111]"
"52A Grammar of Kakuaglottalized obstruents do not undergo post-nasalization as opposed to their nonglottalized counterparts.
The glottalized voiced stops also have nasal allophones, are nasalized in nasal
contexts [NɁ] ~ [NChormoganic]. The distribution of the nasal allophones of glottalized
voiced stops reflect their distribution in oral contexts.
Perceptually, is very difficult to perceive the voicing of morpheme-final
glottalized stops; however, when a vowel-initial suffix is added to glottalized stops
in final position, the contrast with voiceless stops becomes more salient, revealing
the underlying difference between final voiceless stops and final glottalized stops.
When a vowel initial suffix is added to a morpheme with a glottalized consonant
final root a laryngealization of the vowel in the suffix is always audible.
At this point of my research I have not encountered these voiced glottalized
obstruents in either morpheme-initial or morpheme-medial positions. Therefore, I
will illustrate the occurrence of these consonants based on the available data.
An alternative analysis to the series of glottalized consonants is considered at
the end of this section.
A. /bɁ/
The glottalized bilabial voiced obstruent occurs only in final position.
Examples and phonetic realizations of this phoneme are shown in (71) below:
71) /bɁ/ [bɁ] ~ [b̚]. Note /bɁ/ ≠ /b/, and /bɁ/ ≠ /p/.
/pìbɁ/
[pìbɁ] ~ [pìb̚] ‘edible seed sp’ /dìp/
/bâbɁ/
[mbâbɁ] ~[mbâb̚] ‘drink’
/pâb/
/hâp/[ndìp̚] ‘ant’ sp.
[pâbm] ‘cotton’
[hâ:p̚] ‘new/young’The three figures below illustrate the contrast between /bɁ/, /b/, and /p/ in
morpheme-final position. Note the trace of voicing pulses in Figure 2.11 (morphemefinal /bɁ/) and compare with Figure 2.10 (morpheme-final /p/).
Figures 2.11 and 2.12 illustrate minimal pairs of glottalized bilabial /bɁ/ (/bâbɁ/
m
[ bâbɁ] ‘drink’; Fig. 2.11) and plain voiced bilabial /b/ (/bǎb/ [mbǎbm] ‘be white/ripe’;
Fig. 2.12).","[73, 74]"
"2.2Syllable structure2.2.0 General description: syllable
The preferred syllable structure in Kakua is CVC. Most of Kakua’s
morphemes are monosyllabic (84% of the word list used for this work). Syllables
without an onset occur only in V-initial affixes.
Though at a lower rate, open syllables (CV) are also encountered. In wordfinal position, however, these open syllables undergo phonetic vowel lengthening,
forming heavy syllables [CV:].
The process of phonetic vowel lengthening, together with Kakua’s preferred
CVC syllabic structure, seeks to produce heavy syllables as the ideal prototype of
syllabic structure (as the hierarchy below shows).
The syllabic weight can be understood in terms of a continuum favoring CVC
syllables, and whenever an open syllable cannot be avoided, then phonetic vowel
lengthening provides extra weight to the surface structure. Virtually, this continuum
will gradually become flexible in order to include less preferred structures until
finally reaching the less heavy syllabic structure:
CVC > CV: > CV > VC > V
/CVC/
includes: content word roots, affixes, clitics
/CV/ (and [CV:]) includes: content word roots, affixes, clitics
/VC/
includes: V-initial affixes
/V/
includes affixes
In mono- and bisyllabic loans involving root-final open syllables, the CVC
structure is adopted whenever possible, demonstrating a preference for the CVC
syllabic pattern. In borrowings with open syllables, by default the glottal stop /ʔ/ isPhonology 65
epenthesized in the coda position of the final syllable of the word. Speakers of Kakua
speaking Spanish usually transfer the CVC pattern to Spanish:
Spanish
[si]
[pa.pel]
[me.sa]
[ma.ɾi.na]Kakua
[tiʔ]
[pa.pe.laʔ]
[me.saʔ-paʔa]
[ʔĩnãʔ]‘yes’
‘paper’
‘table-cl.flat’
‘Marina’ (proper name)As noted in the examples above, in loan words the glottal stop occurs as a
default epenthetic consonant as a strategy to increase syllable weight, forming an
ideal heavy CVC syllable, whether epenthesized in onset or in coda position.
Vowel-initial suffixes do not insert any epenthetic consonant at the
syllable/morpheme boundary even when the morpheme to which the suffix attaches
is an open-syllable morpheme: CV-VC. This shows evidence that these V-initial
suffixes do not have empty consonant slots. Some of these V-initial suffixes do have
unspecified vowel slots (e.g. past marker -Vp) in which cases the vowel in the suffix
copies the vowel quality of the root to which the suffix is bound.","[86, 87]"
"10.2.2 Progressive aspect: tʃahãp ~ =tʃãhãp
Progressive aspect in Kakua is encoded by the form tʃãhãp. This, as indicated
above, can be a free (or detached) form, but can also be encliticized or even take
verbal morphology on its own as a separate independent predicate. It describes a
situation that is in progress or that has not reached an end point, adopting Comrie’s
(1976:32f) definition of progressive aspect.
In the examples below, the progressive aspect is translated into similar
semantics as that of the progressive –ing ending of verbs in English. Nonetheless, I
think that a more accurate translation would be that of DOING + PREDICATE:
32) têw-at=diʔ
work-NMLZ=OBJhênaʔ-ʔêne=diʔcount-see=OBJ̌ ʔ=na=be
hɨwcome=DECL=REC.PSTwã=tʃãhãp=be1SG=PROG=REC.PST
‘I was coming to predict the weather’ ( lit. ‘I came to the job of counting and
seeing)
I propose this alternative translation on the basis of the (possible) etymology
of the progressive form: it is possible that the progressive form corresponds to a
grammaticalized construction of the verb tʃãh ‘do’ plus the general past marker -Vp,Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality277together forming the progressive tʃãhãp.2 Perhaps the (presumably) verbal identity
of one of the elements in the progressive form (i.e., the verb root tʃãh ‘do’), can help
to understand the versatile morphosyntactic behavior of the progressive tʃãhãp. Verb
stems (as seen in Chapter 8) can be compounded, and this might explain why the
progressive tʃãhãp (which may have a verb stem element in its composition) can be
encliticized to the (main) predicate. This is perhaps a trace of the compounding
ability of the verb tʃãh ‘do’. Verb roots can occur as free forms (when functioning
as a linking element between combined clauses, see Chapter 13); likewise, the
progressive form can stand on its own as a free element, though its function is not
that of combining clauses. Finally, in the same way that verb stems take crossreferencing proclitics and other verbal morphology, the progressive form can also
take both the cross-referencing proclitics and (some) verbal morphology (especially
remote or recent past distinctions). The following examples illustrate the progressive
form as an encliticized element (33), as a free form (34),3 and taking verbal
morphology (35) and (36):
33) wǎjkan=héʔ
kǎnʔ
paj̃̂ =na=ka=tʃãhãp
be.quick=INTS
3SG.F wait=DECL=ASS=PROG
‘quick now! she is waiting!’
34) hîb=na=ka
wěm=bɨt
to.promenade=DECL=ASS 1SG=ALSO
‘I too am taking a walk (promenading)’tʃãhapPROGThis hypothesis is somehow problematic because the progressive aspect is not limited to past
tense encoding. A satisfactory account of the presence of the dedicated past tense marker in this
construction would need more explanation.
3
It is important to note that it is not always clear whether in cases such as the one in (34) it would
be more accurately analyzed as an encliticized form (wěm=bɨt=tʃãhap), or, as it is presented sometimes
here, as a free form. The only criterion for presenting examples such as that of (34) here as a free form
of the progressive is that there was a pause in between the elements (i.e., in between wěm=bɨt and tʃãhap).
For me, however, not being a fluent Kakua speaker, the pause is not always easily identifiable. Likewise,
the cases in which, throughout the corpus, the progressive was transcribed as an encliticized form, respond
to those cases in which I perceived a single phonological word with no pauses. There is a need to revise
these transcriptions of the progressive form in future research (whether or not they should be transcribed
as encliticized forms or free elements), checking one by one with speakers and test for rejection or
acceptability of pauses in between the progressive form and surrounding elements. Additionally, in future
research, stress-accent features and other phonological features may serve as clues to understand the
syntactic behavior (whether attached or not) of this progressive marker.

rather than a perfective one. The following example shows the verb tʃãh ‘do’ as a
lexial verb:
37) dedpaʔni tʃãh=nit=dê=ka
what
do-INTERR=FUT.INF.EVID=ASS
‘what might you do, son?’wã=wɨʔ̌1SG=sonGiven that Kakua has many verbs referring to ‘doing’ particular actions
(DO.ACTION, such as hûb ‘do again’, ʧap ‘perform a prayer for someone’), the use
of the verb root tʃãh ‘do’ is not very frequent across the corpus since the meaning of
‘do’ is already encoded in the semantics of more specific verbs of ‘doing’, in this
sense speakers generally prefer more specific activity verbs to the more
vague/generic ‘do’. When the verb tʃãh ‘do’ is functioning as part of the progressive
form (as seen in the examples in this section, assuming that the etymology of the
progressive does derive from the grammaticalization of tʃãh ‘do’ + -Vp ‘PST’), the
verb tʃãh ‘do’ no longer expresses the core of the event expressed in the sentence,
and it is in those cases that the construction tʃãhãp is analyzed as a progressive verb,
rather than as a lexical verb (tʃãh-ãp do-PST).","[297, 298, 299]"

In nasal contexts, /wɁ/ undergoes nasalization [ẁ̃ ʔ]:

‘to sleep’2.1.5.9Summary of glottalized series81) /~hǎwɁ/As seen in this subsection on glottalized consonants, Kakua has a set of
glottalized voiced obstruents and glottalized glides distinct from the set of plain
voiced stops and glides. This series of glottalized consonants does not have
contrastive voiceless glottalized counterparts (there are no glottalized voiceless
stops).
An alternative, but less elegant, analysis for glottalized consonants would be
to suggest that these are not one single segments but rather they are underlyingly
consonant clusters made up of two segments /C/ +/ʔ/. In nasal contexts the glottal
stop would then assimilate as a homorganic voiceless consonant. This analysis,
however, is made less appealing by the fact that no consonant clusters seem to be
allowed in Kakua’s syllabic and word structure. Therefore, if glottalized consonants
were to be considered two separate segments /C/+/ʔ/, this set of clusters will not be
allowed in morpheme-internal position. Also, this analysis would not predict why
the cluster combination is limited to a small set of consonants and not applied to the
entire phoneme inventory. Additionally, it seems that many languages throughout
the Amazonian region have glottalized consonants of some sort (see Michael et al.
2015). This regional pararell gives grounds to argue for an areal feature of glottalized
(restricted in its distribution) series of consonants, and accepting the glottalized
consonant series as a phonologically plausible analysis.","[82, 83, 84]"
"2.1.5.6 Glottalized consonantsKakua shows a series of glottalized consonants, consisting of the glottalized
stops /bɁ/, /dɁ/, /gɁ/, and glottalized glides /jɁ/, and /wɁ/. This series of glottalized
consonants shows a wide range of allophonic variations depending on their position
in the morpheme.
In final position the glottalized consonants are unreleased:
70) /bâbɁ/[mbâbɁ] ‘to drink’/bǎb/[mbǎbm] ‘be ripe/be whitish’Example 70) above shows a contrastive minimal pair of glottalized and plain
voiced bilabial stops, /bɁ/ ≠ /b/.
Note that the glottalized consonant does not contrast in voicing (they are both
voiced) with its non-glottalized counterpart (where the glottalized /bɁ/ is unreleased
while the plain /b/ is released and undergo post-nasalization in word final position).
The example illustrates the distinctive phonetic realization of glottalized consonants
(CɁ), and plain consonants (C), in word-final position, where the glottalized voiced
stops do not undergo post-nasalization while the plain consonant invariably do
surface as post-nasalized.",[73]
"2.3.2.2 LH Tone
LH [rising] tone is characterized by a rising pitch, starting from a low pitch
and gradually rising to a high pitch, uninterruptedly passing through intermediate
levels.
The rising LH tone is not restricted to a particular syllable or morpheme
structure, and as the examples below show, LH occurs in morphemes with open
syllables, CV [CV:], and closed syllables CVC. Tables 2.16 and 2.17 illustrate
minimal pairs. Some of the examples are repeated.
Table 2.16. LH and HL minimal pairs in monosyllabic morphemes in open
syllables:
LH
HL
/ LH ~ba/
[mǎ:] ‘chief’
/ HL ~ba/ [mâ:] ‘tree/wood/be old’
/ LH hi/
[hǐ:] ‘to shine’
/ HL hi/
[hî:] ‘son in law/strain’
LH
n
/ je/
[ ʤě:] ‘avina’ (fruit sp)
/ HL je/
[nʤê:] ‘fish sp’
/ LH ʧɨ/

/ HL ʧɨ/
[ʧɨ ̂:] ‘pineapple’

Figures 2.27 and 2.28 below illustrate a minimal pair contrast for LH [rising]
and HL [falling] tones in morphemes with open syllables. Figure 2.29 shows these
minimal tone pairs co-occurring.",[102]
