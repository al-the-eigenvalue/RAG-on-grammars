orthography, but is also very attractive for the native speakers, since
preservation of their language is very important to many of them. Oral
literature was gathered: proverbs, riddles, folktales, which is an excellent means
for developing u consistent system of word boundaries in the language, Of

and following environment. The rules that predict their realisation are given
above. In this section, some remaining problems of the interpretation of the
rising and falling tones are discussed: first of all the problem of the
interpretation of LH in relation to the LM tone, then those that occur as the
result of the merger of two syllables at morpheme boundaries, MH, HM, and
partly also LM.
