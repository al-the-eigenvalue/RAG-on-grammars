"7.7.2.1 Polar questions
Polar questions do not involve a question word. They consist of a full sentence and
expect an answer in terms of yes and no. Polar questions in Makalero need not be
marked morphologically as such. In such cases, it is only the rising-falling
intonation contour that marks them as interrogatives. An example is given in (117),
with the corresponding pitch contour shown in Figure 7.4. Note that the overall pitch
contour gently rises, reaching a peak on the final syllable; following this pitch peak,
there is a distinctive drop on that same syllable.

Na’an, the negative existential, and oko-na ‘not yet’ are frequently used as one-word
answers to yes/no-questions. There is, however, no good positive one-word answer.
The Portuguese loan sim ‘yes’ is found in that function very occasionally. Also,
speakers accepted the verb tafi ‘true’ as a one-word answer upon questioning,
though such a structure was not produced in natural speech. In general, the most
common reply to a polar question is the repetition of a part of or the whole sentence.
Two examples are shown in (118) and (119).
(118)Ei tafi isit? – Ani tafi isit.

3sNSIT husband-seeperhaps NSIT husband-see‘Is she married already? – Maybe.’(elic1152-1152a)In the case of verbs with complement clause extensions, such as so’ot ‘want’ in
(117) above, it is these superordinate verbs that are repeated as one-word answers
two polar questions. That is, a positive answer to a question as (117) is so’ot ‘(I)
want’.
Polar questions can be overtly marked as such by the markers =ua and =uai (na’an),
both of which are cliticised to the right end of the question. Note that =ua is
homophonous with the relative marker (§ 3.3.5.1, p. 240). While a historical
relationship between the two is unproven, it is a fact that relative makers very
commonly derive from interrogative words cross-linguistically. (120) and (121) give440CHAPTER 7examples of the use of =ua as a question marker (see § 7.7.1, p. 435, above for the
use of the same particle with declaratives).

There are two kinds of interrogatives, namely polar questions (yes/no-questions) and
interrogative word questions (wh-questions). In the following, § 7.7.2.1 (p. 438)
gives a short discussion of polar questions, followed by § 7.7.2.2 (p. 443) on
interrogative word questions.","[462, 463]"
"3.2.3.3.2 Clausal adverbials
The adverbial expressions discussed in § 3.2.3.1.1 (p. 141) are fully clausal by
themselves. Since the predicate is the only obligatory element in a clause (see § 6,
p. 383), they must be predicative. Verbs are the unmarked choice for the predicate
function. There is no evidence, such as an argument use, suggesting such adverbials
are of any other category. By a process of elimination, then, clausal adverbials are
analysed as verbal. They differ from other verbs mainly with respect to valency, in
that they are not associated with any arguments at all. Furthermore, even though
they are fully clausal, they are not found forming utterances on their own, but are
used only in multi-clause sentences. For instance, the answer to the information
question in (186) repeats the whole question; an answer consisting of only the focal
part, kaminei ‘tomorrow’, is considered unacceptable. Similarly, in (187), the
avalent adverbial predicate tone’ ‘perhaps’ does not constitute an acceptable answer
to the question; it must be combined with another predicate, in this case fani’ ‘like
(this)’.

In other instances, interrogative clauses with =oo are indirect questions, and, more
specifically, questions to which the speaker does not know the answer. The
following clause generally contains the verb ma’en ‘know’ and is negated,
expressing the speaker’s ignorance on the subject. The indirect question can be
understood as a left-dislocated object to that clause’s verb of knowing. Examples are
given in (49) and (50).",[491]

Table 3.15: VP-internal adverbials with full verb uses102(180) and (181) exemplify such full-verb uses. In (180), tafi ‘true’ functions as a
one-word answer to a yes-no question, which shows that it is predicative on its own.
On the other hand, in (181), teni ‘again’ is the predicate in a full clause, with its own
subject ei (2s).

(179), these verbs can be used as separate adverbial clauses in multi-clause
sentences, too. In such cases, they are most often linked to the following clause by
means of a clause linker, as in (182) and (183), where the linker =ini is used. Note
that in this construction, the adverbial clause can either precede, as in (182), or
follow, as in (183), the main verb’s subject. 103 (180) above gives equivalent
evidence. Adverbial verbs with clause linkers cannot, however, appear in the VPinternal adverbial position.

(183)Kiloo tafi=ni
3S(elic1108)hai tia.true=LNK1 NSIT sleep‘He is really already asleep.’(chat066)Note that tafi ‘true’ stands in (182) and (183) with no argument at all. In terms of
valency, it is thus an avalent verb (§ 3.2.3.1.1, p. 141). It differs in this respect from
all other adverbial verbs which have been found in full verb use. For instance, teni
‘again’ is illustrated in (181), where it stands with a subject argument.","[185, 186]"

strict syntactic constraints on the expression of participants. Consequently,
somewhat more complex states of affairs, such as those involving a predicative
adverbial expression or those with more than two participants, must be expressed in
two clauses, while they constitute, both semantically as well as phonologically, a
single event or utterance. Such sentences are discussed in § 7.1 (p. 402). The
biclausal expression of a ditransitive state of affairs qualifies as one argument
structure construction in Goldberg’s (1995) terminology.
In natural speech, a minority of clauses fill all the positions provided by the clause
templates in (3) and (4). In fact, the nucleus of the clause, or its predicate, is the only
obligatory element. Both verbal arguments as well as any kinds of periphery
elements are readily omittable, given an appropriate context. As such, a single verb
can make up a complete clause. Examples are shown in (5) and (6), which show the
negative existential na’an and the modal verb so’ot ‘want, like’, respectively, used
as minimal answers to polar questions. Both are full verbs, which can take a subject
argument and aspect marking, as shown for na’an in (7), and a subject argument, an
aspect marker, and a complement argument, as shown for so’ot in (8).

"DISCOURSE STRUCTURE5019.2.3.1 The contrastive marker =ini
The NP-level clitic =ini (§ 3.5.2.5.1, p. 248) functions as a marker of
contrastiveness. Its principle function in such contexts is the marking of the referent
of its NP host as contrasting with another possible referent. Typical examples are
given in (28) and (29).
(28)… amuni ki=rial=eeso’ot=ini dame=na’a=po ini=niperson ATTR=many.HUM=DEF want=LNK1 peace=INT=ADVR 1pe=CTRnomo so’ot...

(81-12)
(29)Uere=ini ani masan.
2DEM=CTR 1sfear‘That’s what I was afraid of.’(elic671)In (28), ini=ni (the first person plural exclusive pronoun with the contrastive marker
cliticised to it) contrasts with an explicitly mentioned set of other people (amuni
ki=rial=ee ‘many people’), whereas in (29), the contrast is not expressed, but only
implied. Also, (28) and (29) show that the contrastive marker can both lose its initial
vowel if cliticised to a vowel-final element or retain it; it shares this characteristic
with the clause linker =ini (see § 3.5.2.5.2, p. 249).
A context where the contrastive =ini appears particularly frequently is in
interrogative word questions and their answers, as exemplified in (30). Note that
mu’ani ‘who’ and sa’ani ‘what’, the subject forms of the interrogatives mu’a- ‘who
(BD)’ and sa’a- ‘what (BD)’, respectively, are actually grammaticalised
combinations of the stem and the contrastive marker =ini, as shown by the fact that
both mu’ani ‘who’ and sa’ani ‘what’ can be marked as contrastive with another
=ini, yielding mu’ani=ini and sa’ani=ni, respectively (see § 3.3.1.4, p. 228).
(30)Ei-sa’aniisit? – Asi-puulata=ni isit.2s-what.SUBJ ill1s:POSS-head=CTR ill‘What hurts? – My head hurts.’
(lit. Your what is ill)(almeida016, almeida017)The marking of asi-puulata ‘my head’ with =ini in (30) can be perceived as
contrasting with all other body parts which constitute possible answers to the
question.
While (31) below (as (28) above) marks only one element of the overtly expressed
contrasting pair of referents, (32) shows that it is also an option to mark both
members of the pair.","[525, 526]"
"8.3.5 Complement clause extensions to verbs of saying
and modal verbs
A problematic case for the classification of clause linkage types into either
coordinating or subordinating ones is presented by verbs of saying and modal verbs
(§ 3.2.3.10, p. 186) and their, for lack of a better term, complement clause
extensions. A common characteristic of all these constructions is that they can be
expressed in the form of a coordinative clause linkage either without a marker, or
using =ini, as shown in (110) and (111), respectively.
(110)… ei-dada=niei asar=isi ei dadau [mei la’a ue’].2s-grandparent=CTR 2s send=LNK2 2s musttakemove V2DEM‘… your grandfather sent you, so you have to take (them) there.’

1sillmalariaani fatar=ini [la’a=niCLS=LNK1=too 1sata haka].force=LNK1 move=LNK1 fire search‘Even when I had malaria, they forced me to go and find firewood.’
(103-08)
Syntactically, constructions such as those in (110) and (111) show little signs of
being in a hierarchical relationship. § 3.2.3.10.1.2 (p. 189) shows that such verbs as
fana ‘teach’, fuin ‘dare’, pada ‘order’ and der ‘reply’ allow for the expression of a
preverbal undergoer object alongside a postverbal complement clause extension.
This shows that the complement clause extension does not function as an argument
to the verb in question; if it did, such constructions would violate the maximal clause
template, which allows for the expression of two arguments at most in a clause (§ 6,
p. 383). § 3.6.2 (p. 265) speculates that such postverbal complement clause
extensions originate as regular arguments to a separate verb, reflected in today’s
quotative marker ain (§ 3.2.3.12.3, p. 205). The clausal complement would then486CHAPTER 8have been the object argument to that verb of saying in the regular preverbal nonsubject argument position.
There is, however, one use of such constructions which does seem to indicate some
hierarchical relation between the two clauses involved. It involves polar questions
and the answers to them. As (112) shows, a reply to a polar question generally
repeats the VP of the question. The reply to a polar question involving a modal verb
and its complement clause extension in a coordinated construction, however, repeats
only the modal verb, as shown in (113).
(112)Kiloo hai nami-ena? – Tone’ hai nami-ena.
3sNSIT husband-seeperhaps NSIT husband-see‘Is she married already? – Maybe.’
(113)… ei so’ot=ini ueri(elic1152, elic1152a)leuk? – So’ot.2s want=LNK1 bottom drillwant‘… do you want (your) bottom to be drilled? – I do.’(118-38, 118-39)For some of the verbs with complement clause extensions discussed in § 3.2.3.10
(p. 186), this coordinating construction is the only way of expressing a clausal
complement.
Others, however, allow for a variety of alternative constructions which clearly
involve syntactic dependency between the two parts. On the one hand, the clausal
complements to some verbs can be expressed in the form of a preverbal argument,
as shown in (114) and (115).
(114)… ei hai nomo hul=afta [ni-nomo hul=ee]OBJ lolo.

the complement clause extension is constructed as an object argument.
Some modal verb constructions, on the other hand, involve a complement-verb
complex, where the modal verb is subordinated to the proposition it modifies.
Examples are shown in (116) and (117).

"THE SENTENCE4437.7.2.2 Interrogative word questions
As discussed in § 3.2.3.6 (p. 167) and § 3.3.1.4 (p. 228), question words in Makalero
fall into two separate lexical classes. Sa’a- ‘what (BD)’ and mu’a- ‘who (BD)’ have
been categorised as pronouns, while all other question words are verbal.
(126) shows a monoclausal question with the pronominal interrogative sa’a- ‘what
(BD)’, while (127) exemplifies a question with the interrogative taure- ‘which (BD)’
functioning as the complement to fani’ ‘be like’. The whole of this complement-verb
complex translates as ‘how’. Notwithstanding the different syntactic status of the
interrogatives used, the corresponding pitch contours show that the intonation is
largely the same, i.e. gently falling. Notice, however, the very slight peak on the
(pen)ultimate in both cases.

Questions with interrogative words and polar questions (§ 7.7.2.1, p. 438) are thus
clearly distinct structures in all respects, including such aspects as presence of

The intonation of a question with the =uai na’an question tag is similar to that of a

overall pitch rises slightly, culminating on =uai ‘or’, before falling on the negative
existential na’an.","[465, 466]"

are retrievable from the context are readily left unexpressed. (9) and (10) show
sentences with unexpressed subject arguments, the positions of which are marked by
Ø. In (9), which comes from a spoken text, the speaker assumes the hearer to be able
to infer the intended subject referent, since it has been the topic in previous
sentences. (10), on the other hand, comes from a context-less elicited clause. In this
example, apparently the speaker deemed a third person pronominal object to be at180As found with divalent verbs; the class of avalent verbs (§ 3.2.3.1.1, p. 141), on the other hand, is not

followed by a distinct fall. This corresponds to the peak on the ultimate in the
unmarked question in Figure 7.4. This pitch peak is followed by another, smaller
peak, on the question marker =ua. In other words, the intonation of a =ua-marked
question appears to be the same as that of an unmarked question, with the addition
of a smaller intonation peak for the question marker, following the main peak on the
verb.",[465]

(124-18, 124-19)
There are a few instances where =konai, either on its own or in combination with
another linker, occurs at the end of an utterance. An example is given in (75).
(75)Asi-ina=nihaisopen=isiuai=konai.1s:POSS-eye=CTR NSIT sleepy=LNK2 CLS=CSQ‘Because I was already sleepy.’(elic1147a)This sentence gives the reason that caused another action; this action, however, is
not expressed. In fact, (75) is the answer to the question in (76). As such, (75) could
be seen as an elliptical sentence, where a clause expressing the consequence as given
in the question is left unexpressed after uai=konai. A complete version of the
answer, with expression of the consequence clause, would presumably look like
(77).

Another – though very small – set of rather curious instances is where the normal
time-iconic order of reason and consequence, as found in all previous examples,
does not seem to be maintained. An example is given in (78).
(78)… amuni ki=rial=ee

(98-53)
Even though the translation into English using ‘because’ in (78) appears to be in line
with translations for =konai as given so far, this sentence does not tie in with the
meaning proposed here for =konai, which links a first clause, expressing a cause,474CHAPTER 8and a second clause, expressing a consequence of the first clause. In (78), however,
the fact that people might come and look for the Makalero language is not the cause
of them wanting to learn a new language. Rather, the reverse order would be logical,
namely that people’s desire to learn a new language causes them to come and look
for Makalero. To date, only three such ‘reversed’ examples have been found. As
such, this phenomenon can be considered marginal for the time being, though future
research might shed more light on it.","[497, 498, 499]"

the distinctive fall found on unmarked questions and those with the marker =ua.

associated with an undergoer. Lesa ‘not have’, lu’a ‘not get’ and tule ‘not want’, on
the other hand, are clearly transitive and include an undergoer participant in their
semantic participant frame. The cases of nopa’e ‘cannot’ and oko-na ‘not yet’ and
irau ‘not allowed’ are somewhat unclear with respect to transitivity. Used as full
verbs, they do not cooccur with non-subject arguments, indicating that they are
intransitive. On the other hand, constructions where they are used as complement
verbs suggest that they may take an argument expressing an undergoer; the evidence
in question is provided in § 3.2.3.10.2.1 (p. 193). Finally, isipo’ ‘not know’ is in all
cases used as a clause on its own, without any participants expressed. An example is
(211). It is therefore impossible to determine its transitivity.

Oko-na ‘not yet’, nopa’e ‘cannot’ irau ‘not allowed’ and tule ‘not want’ are further
distinguished from the other transitive negative verbs in that they can take
subordinated complement clause extensions (see § 3.2.3.10.2, p. 193, for details on
that construction type).","[195, 196]"

In fact, the different-subject connotation of =isi is so strong that, even where the
subjects of the two clauses in question are unexpressed, the use of =isi is clear
enough an indicator to ensure a correct understanding of the sentence. An example is
given in (20), where the answer to the question ‘why is this child crying?’ basically
consists of two verbs only, namely pase ‘beat’ and iar ‘cry’. The linker =isi between
these two predicates indicates that these actions are not carried out by the same
agents, while uai=konai (see § 8.1.6, p. 471) shows that the second is to be
understood as a consequence of the first. The overall interpretation is thus as shown
in (20).

(elic142)460CHAPTER 8Through its strong association with subject changes, =isi is an important device
aiding reference tracking in texts (see § 9.1, p. 491).
However, the marking of a subject change is an associated, rather than the main
function of =isi. This is shown by the occurrence of such sentences as (21), where
=isi is used as a linker between clauses with the same agent.

While the subjects of the constituent clauses of (21) are the same, they specify two
quite distinct and unrelated states of affairs. As such, I would like to argue that the
main function of =isi is the linking of clauses expressing actions which are
perceived to be loosely related to one another. (22) demonstrates the difference
between =ini and =isi: note that the first and the second verbs, ue’ (V2DEM) and
ena ‘see’, are linked by =ini, showing that they are perceived to be closely
connected. In fact, they pertain to one event, as ue’ can be seen to give locative
information for the action of seeing. Horu ‘bark’, however, is linked to ena ‘see’ by
=isi, showing that the two are distinct actions, one following the other.

The default focus is on the non-subject argument or the whole of the VP, with no
special construction or marking. There is, however, one specific construction to
mark foci. In this construction, a sentence with an empty position is directly
followed by the same (or a very similar) sentence where the previously omitted
constituent is inserted as the focus. The resulting structure somewhat resembles a
question word interrogative (§ 7.7.2.2, p. 443), which includes a variable to be filled
in the answer. Two examples are given in (26) and (27), with the empty position in
the first sentence marked by Ø.

focus as given by Lambrecht (1996: 213) as “[t]he semantic component of a
pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion differs from the
presupposition”: it gives an open proposition with an empty position, which is then
filled. Note that in both of the illustrated cases, these foci are subjects, which are
preferentially interpreted as topics. It is possible that this marked mapping of
pragmatic relations on grammatical relations causes the focus to be expressed in this
specific construction. However, it is overall quite rare.","[524, 525]"

Declaratives are not usually marked as such by an overt morpheme. However, some
speakers use the clitic =uai ‘or’ at the end of a declarative. This morpheme is more
commonly a question marker and its use in declaratives is an idiosyncracy of
individual speakers. (116) gives an example, including the sentence ending in =uai
as well as the following sentence. Note that the particle is not repeated in tail-head
linkage (§ 9.3.1, p. 507). The pitch contour of the bracketed part in (116), shown in

This leaves the question as to the direction of such a shift. The fact that place and clan names make use
of the voiced bilabial plosive (§ 3.1.3.1.2, p. 111) suggests an incomplete loss of a voiced plosive series.

Examples from recorded texts are referenced in the grammar part by the number of

Elicitation sessions were not recorded. Indonesian was used as the meta-language in
these cases. The reference ‘elic’, along with the number of a given sentence in my
notes, marks elicited sentences, sentences I constructed myself to elicit
grammaticality judgements from native speakers, as well as sentences I overheard in
discourse. A number of sentences were elicited with pictograms based on Skopeteas
et al. (2006). These are designed to locate markers of information structure and are
marked as ‘fisquest’.
In 2008, courtesy of the Fataluku Language Project (http://fataluku.com/) and Sr.
Vítor Rosado Marques of the Instituto de Investigação Científica Tropical (IICT), I
travelled to Lisbon to evaluate the records on Timorese languages kept in the IICT.
During this trip, I was thus able to view the earliest Makalero data collected some 40
to 60 years ago (see § 1.7, p. 27). These data are quite different in some respects
from those gathered by myself in Timor. It is not clear to what extent these
differencesare due to local variants of the language and to what extent language
change is involved. As a consequence, wherever such examples are used in the
following, they are marked as such with the reference ‘almeida’. I combined this trip
to Lisbon with a short stay in Porto, where I had made contact with Olávio Cabral,
who was at the time a student at Porto university and originates from Tirilolo in the32CHAPTER 1Iliomar subdistrict (see Map 4). Olávio helped me immensly in transcribing
recordings and answering numerous questions I had prepared. During the last two
years of the project, Olávio was very often available online, so that I could ask him
more questions to test hypotheses through email and chat. Sentences collected
during my visit to Porto are marked as ‘pelic’. Also, Olávio did another run of the
information structure pictograms (marked as ‘isquest’). Sentences gained through
email or from an occasional online chat are referenced to as ‘chat’.","[56, 57]"

"8.2.1 Summary
The large majority of clause linkage types discussed in the pervious sections show
no syntactic evidence of a hierarchical relation between the clauses involved. The
clause linkers used in these constructions basically combine two independent
clauses, without affecting them otherwise. § 8.3.6 (p. 488) argues that the same
sentences, including the linkers, may alternatively be used in subordinating
constructions. Hence the linkage between two clauses as expressed by this one
group of clause linkers is really indeterminate as to the syntactic relation between
them. In general, a time-iconic ordering of the clauses in question is preferred,
although some linkers, such as =isi (LNK2, § 8.1.1, p. 457) and =konai (CSQ,
§ 8.1.6, p. 471), exhibit a very moderate degree of positional freedom.
The linkers =taa (PURP, § 8.1.8, p. 474) and =kini (IND, § 8.1.9, p. 476) differ
from the majority of clause linkers in that they can not only be placed between the
two clauses they link, but, alternatively or additionally, also within the second clause
of the structure. As such, in these cases, the second clause is structurally affected by
the linkage and can be analysed as subordinated (see § 8.3, p. 481, for more
discussion). For this reason, the two linkers in question are treated in § 3.5.3.1
(p. 250) apart form all the others. That section also includes the purposive elements
=p- and =ua. There is, however, no syntactic evidence for the latter two as
subordinating and their grouping with the aforementioned subordinating linkers is
based on their similar semantics.
Several of the clause linkers can be combined. § 8.2.1.1 (p. 478) briefly discusses
the most common combinations.",[503]

"3.2.3.10 Verbs with complement clause extensions
A number of verbs in Makalero are commonly found with postverbal clausal
extensions. These extensions may consist of single clauses, but also multi-clause
units (i.e. sentences, see § 7, p. 401). All of these verbs are found in a construction
where the clausal extension follows the main verb in a coordinated construction.
These clausal extensions, called complement clause extensions in the following, are
not to be confused with the complements which are an instantiation of the nonsubject argument in the clause, as opposed to objects (§ 5.2, p. 319). Their syntactic
status is not straightforward. Some constructions suggest that they are not arguments
of the verb (§ 3.2.3.10.1.2, p. 189). On the other hand, some verbs allow for an
alternative construction which involves a nominalised clause equivalent to the
complement clause extension in the preverbal object position. In this case, it clearly
is an argument of the verb. § 8.3.5 (p. 485) gives some more discussion on the
syntactic status of complement clause extensions. On the basis of the variant
constructions that are possible with them, the verbs in question are classified into
distinct groups. The major division is between verbs of saying and modal verbs; the
former are discussed in § 3.2.3.10.1 (p. 187), the latter in § 3.2.3.10.2 (p. 193).",[211]
"1.6.4 The noun phrase
The noun phrase in Makalero is relatively straightforward. The head noun is
preceded by a possessive phrase, while all other dependents (i.e. modifiers and
determiners) follow it. Most variation is found in the domain of the modifier, which
may be nominal, verbal, or fully clausal. As well as unmarked modifiers, there are
modifiers introduced by the clitic attributive marker ki=. These are generally
contrasting the referent in question with other possible referents with respect to the
quality they express (§ 4.3.4, p. 284). There are, furthermore, genuine relative
sentences18 in Makalero. The marking of these is centred on the subject of the
relative clause, be it the head of the modifier or within the modifier. In the latter
case, the head noun may be marked additionally. This results in a combination of18They are called relative sentences rather than relative clauses because they may be multiclausal.",[47]

The most frequent use of the derived deictic verbs, however, is not that of a main
predicate in a clause. Rather, they are used in argument position, as in the examples
in (250) and (251). In most of those cases, they appear to recapitulate an object
mentioned in an earlier clause, often one which is very long. Note that not the whole

The fact that =oo cannot stand on its own, but needs this clause-level “docking
station”, shows clearly that it is a clitic.3.5.2.2 =uai ‘or’
=uai is cliticised to the first of two or more noun phrases or clauses in a sequence,
presenting them as alternatives. (432) shows it on NP level, while in (433), it is used
on clause level.

(50-02)
=uai differs from all the other clause linkers through the fact that it is never found
cliticised to the clausal pro-form uai (§ 3.2.3.12.2, p. 204); this may be due to the
fact that the two are basically homophonous, although there is no concrete evidence
to support this idea.
A very frequent use of =uai is in the tag question =uai na’an (=or NEG.EX). An
example is given in (434). See § 7.7.2 (p. 438) for more information on interrogative
sentences.
(434)… ei to-so’ot=uaina’an?2s accompany:RED-want=or NEG.EX‘… do you want to (do it) or not?’(120-044)=uai is used by some speakers at the end of an utterance, which may be either

other hand, inherently convey the notion of the subject participant being located at

adverb uari ‘still’, which marks progressivity with activities (see § 5.3.3.1, p. 368),
is read as ‘still’ with statives, i.e. expressing a longer-than-expected duration. As an
instance, in (147), with the stative verb ma’en ‘know’, uari can only be read as
‘still’; an alternative reading as progressive was rejected.

(* Abilio is knowing French.)(elic1273a)99Hau is also read as a superlative with predicatively used nouns. In terms of aktionsart, thus, these
predicates are stative. This is consistent with their semantics as denoting a property (§ 3.1.1, p. 100)
rather than an action. In the example in (ix), noko ‘younger sibling’ functions as a predicate within the
modifier position of the NP (§ 4, p. 273), headed in this case by the same lexeme in argument use.

verbs leto- ‘through’ and seti- ‘pass’ are read as comparatives. The construction in
question is a complement-verb complex with the stative verb as the main verb and
either leto- ‘through’ or seti- ‘pass’ as the complement verb (§ 5.2.2.2, p. 326). (148)

"38CHAPTER 22.1.1 Minimal pairs
The present section presents a list of (near) minimal pairs to determine phonemic
contrasts between the native consonants. Loan consonants are treated separately in
§ 2.1.2.2 (p. 53). Wherever possible, the native consonants are contrasted both
within a morpheme and at its boundaries (see § 2.4, p. 74 for a more detailed
discussion of phonotactics). Also, an attempt has been made to find word pairs
exhibiting the consonant phonemes in question in the vicinity of different vowels, so
as to show their contrastiveness in all possible contexts. As far as possible, I have
tried to limit myself to native Makalero vocabulary; however, the language is rich in
borrowings (see § 1.6.1, p. 16), some of which seem to be very old and have been
completely integrated in the phonological system. I accepted minimal pairs
involving such borrowings as valid for the demonstration of the distinctiveness of a
sound, if no other word could readily be found. Furthermore, the list is limited to
lexical morphemes, to the exclusion of function words, for which different rules
apply in some respects (see § 2.2.3.2, p. 64).
The sounds that are contrasted in the following list are principally those that differ
from each other by only one articulatory feature. In the case of place of articulation,
however, only pairings of sounds immediately adjacent to one another in Table 2.1
are tested. On the other hand, all manners of articulation are tested. Also, the list
includes a few other pairings which seem to be prone to non-distinctiveness.

The clitic =ua (§ 3.3.5.1, p. 243) is, similarly to ki= (§ 3.3.5.2, p. 240, § 4.3.4,

"3.2.3.3.1 Verb-phrase internal adverbials
A variety of adverbials stand within a verb phrase, in one of two adverbial positions
(§ 5.3.3, p. 367). In terms of Van Valin and LaPolla’s (1997) analysis of the clause,
which has been adopted in the present work, they are analysed as the clause
periphery (§ 6.5, p. 393). Table 3.14 lists the items found in this function. In the
typical examples in (177) and (178), the aspect marker hai, which is the leftmost
verbal modifier (see § 5.3.1.1, p. 361), precedes the adverbials na’u ‘just’ and tepa
‘constantly’, respectively. This demonstrates that the adverbials in question stand
within the VP.",[184]

Even though this distinction is not as rigidly grammaticalised in Makalero as in
other languages, there are some indications that suggest it is a relevant factor. For
instance, there are some homophonous pairs of lexemes which carry radically
different meanings depending on their category. Examples are given in (8) and (9).
55Possessive modifers with verbs in referring function are usually the agents of the verbal actions in
question; possessors referring to non-agentive participants are found in the corpus only with locative
verbs.",[123]
"376CHAPTER 55.3.3.3 Floating quantifiers
§ 3.2.3.14 (p. 215) identifies hau ‘all’ and ata’u ‘all’ as floating quantifiers, which
can be constructed as either predications of their own within multi-clause sentences
or as adverbials within a VP. When they stand in the adverb slot within a VP, they
are read as quantifying the VP-internal argument. As separate predications within a
sentence, however, the quantifiers in question are understood to predicate a property
of the subject of that sentence. The different constructions are thus clearly associated
with distinct readings. The two floating quantifiers are discussed in § 5.3.3.3.1
(p. 376) and § 5.3.3.3.2 (p. 380), respectively.","[400, 401]"
"5.2.2.6.2 Hai’ ‘be finished’
Bound verb forms with altered onsets as listed in § 3.2.2.2.2.2 (p. 135) occur only
when the complement position of the verbs in question is filled. In the case of hai’
‘be finished’, the bound form -sai’ is found not only in complement-verb complexes,
but also in environments that are not so easily reconcilable with this structure. (125)
shows the bound form -sai’ used in a verbal complex. This is as expected; the use of
hai’ ~ -sai’ ‘end’ in these contexts conforms to the use of the free and the bound
forms of the other verbs given in 
§ 3.2.2.2.2.2 (p. 135).
(125)… iraama [ta-mi]COMPL-sai’...paddy garden REC-along:RED-finished:BD‘… the paddies are demarcated (along one another)...’(55-29)In most cases, however, the use of the form -sai’ appears to be dependent on the
semantic nature of the verb’s subject. Concretely, whenever it denotes a span of
time, -sai’ appears. Examples are given in (126) and (127). With all other semantic
types of subjects, hai’ is used, as the comparison with (128) shows.

(elic1303)
Whereas hau can very easily be negated, as shown above, this is not the case for hai,
as pointed out in § 6.6.1 (p. 394).
Another instantiation of the disparity between hai and hau is that the former adds an
initial boundary to verbs that do not include one in their semantics. Conversely, if
hau is used with a stative verb, it is not the case that a final boundary is added to the
verb in question. (221) and (222) show how hau and hai contrast with the stative
verb ma’en ‘know’; in (221), as shown above, hau denotes a high degree of the
property expressed by the verb, whereas in (222), the new situation marker hai
provides ma’en ‘know’ with a left boundary, which is not originally part of the
verbal meaning.

more common in the speech of younger speakers.

"5.1 The head
The only obligatory element of the VP is the predicate, which is thus analysed as its
head. The VP differs in this respect from the NP, in which the head is not obligatory
(§ 4.1, p. 273). The prototypical predicate is a verb (see § 3.2, p. 125, for
information on that lexical category). However, basically any content word can
function as a predicate. § 3.1.1 (p. 100) points out the basic meaning correspondence
between lexemes classified as nouns if used in argument function as opposed to their
use in predicate function. There is one construction, found with verbs of movement
and their goals, which suggests even place names can take this function. The
construction in question is discussed in § 3.1.3.1.2 (p. 111). This functional
flexibility is one of the main reasons for the difficulty to determine lexical categories
in Makalero.
Prototypical verbal predicates are illustrated in (4) and (5) above. (6) exemplifies a
simple noun in predicate function. (7), for comparison, shows the same noun in
argument function. (8) shows a full NP, consisting of a head noun, a modifier and a
determiner, in predicate function. (9) shows an equivalent NP in argument function
for comparison.

"THE SENTENCE4157.2.1.1.1 Future
Future time reference can be expressed in a variety of ways. One of these involves
the adverbial predicate tone’ as listed in (35) above. This item is actually a marker of
deontic modality (discussed in more detail in § 7.3, p. 421). In a small number of
cases, however, it appears to express not the speaker’s commitment to the truth
content of the sentence, but rather marks future time reference. (38) and (39)
illustrate two such cases.
(38)Ani hai ma’en kiloo tone’

(39)Ani tone’
1s(elic1587)ei nomo isi-nilu.perhaps 2s NEGat:RED-forget‘I will not forget you.’(elic1068)Tone’ shares future time reference with the phrasal clitic =na’a (see § 3.5.3.2.1,
p. 262). This clitic’s main function is to mark an action as an intention, as in (40).
(40)… ani aire’ ma’u-ni

Portugal -at:RED-move=INT‘… I am now at the airport, and I intend to go to Portugal.’(74-017)However, frequently, the intention component is less dominant, in which case =na’a
simply refers to an action that has not yet happened at the time of reference.
Generally, the action in question is set in a relatively near future, as (41) illustrates.
In fact, ‘be about to’ is often an appropriate translation.
(41)… filafu’=ana=uai umu=na’a=uai fi1pi live=INT=ordie=INT=oroko nomo ma’en.1pi yetNEGknow‘... whether we are going to live or die we don’t know yet…’ (17-12a)
The grammaticalisation process of =na’a seems to be progressing in a direction in
which the requirement for the future to be relatively near is being lost; in (42),
=na’a refers to an unspecified, and possibly rather remote, point in time.
(42)Ini haka-hau umu=na’a.
1pe all-alldie=INT‘We will all die.’(pelic298)=na’a is not restricted to sentences with present or future reference, but can equally
well occur in sentences with past time reference, which results in a future-in-the-past
reading. In such a context, =na’a very frequently, though not always, has the416CHAPTER 7connotation that the action was intended, but did in the end not come to pass, as
exemplified in (43) and (44).

"8.1.3 Concessive clause linkage
The clitic =oo ‘too’, if used on clause level, links two clauses in a concessive
relation. (43) and (44) give typical examples.

1s=CTR ill=too1sla’a=niata haka.force=LNK1 move=LNK1 fire search‘Even if I was ill, they forced me to go and gather firewood.’ (103-09)

(101-476)
Apart from its most general concessive use, =oo can be found with clauses in a
variety of specific constructions. The clausal host to =oo is in these cases of a
clearly delimitable kind, and its semantics are rather distinct from that of the general
use of the clitic as laid out above and restricted to the construction in question.",[490]
