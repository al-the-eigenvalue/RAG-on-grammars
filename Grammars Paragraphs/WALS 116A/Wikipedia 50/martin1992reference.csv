302 penrrA Reference Grammar of Korean'fhough you mty makc stltemens about yourself in this way, you sel<.lom answer questions about
yourself with casual statements, tbr it would seem evasive not bc more det'inite with infbrmrrion about
your own activities and intentions when directly queried on them.
(5) A casual command. \Mth the period or the exclamation-point intonation, the casual style can bs
used as a soft command 'suppose you just * ':
TAyhapsil ey anc.ese kitalisici yo(!)'Suppose you girls sit down and wait in the lounge'.
(6) A casual question. With the question-mark intonation, the casual style indicates a yes-or-noquestion'l suppose that .. ?':Kongwen ey kaci (5ro)? 'l suppose we're going to the park?'
Eti kaci (yo)? 'l suppose you're going somewhere?' Cr Eti ka (yo). or Eti kana yo. 'Where are
you going?'
Questions which contain a content-interrogative (such as mucs meaning 'what' rather than 'something')
often seem too specit'icfor such a casual inquiry; but they sometimes occur, with the period intonation:
i
Phullathuphom un meych pen ici yo. 'What (number) plattbrm do you suppose it
To sum up the uses of the casual -ci (yo) with the various intonations:
-ci
(l) 'I suppose
'I guess .- ' * ; you
:,
(2) 'suppose we .'Let's (us) '
:
(3) 'suppose you .'Please
'Do ,
(4) 'l suppose - ?'; 'Wh- do you suppose :-is?'yo.","[297, 298]"
"Aftenhought sentences are made in the intimate and (+ yo) polite styles by an adverbialization
(91.1.10) with the gerund -ko, which is commonly pronounced -kwu, especially before yo.""-in thiscolloquill structur0. Accortling trr P:rk Sungwen (108-9) tho scntcncc-l'inll gcrund can be uscd cithur to
express an afterthought, as here described, or in answer to a question. Ordinarily the gerund does not
occur at the end of a sentence, but it can be used to tinalize a kind of afterthought in much the same
way that an English sentence sometimes begins with 'And also, ':
. Phyo nun cti se sa yo. Tlo kaps un rlma 'ko yo. 'where do we buy tickes? And how much are
they?'",[299]
"1.9. External puuctuation.
Koreans borrow English and Japanese punctuation treely. The standard practices accord, more or
less, with the current American usage. Parentheses, commas, and quotation marks are seen more
frequently than semicolons or colons. Sentences usually end with a period, but question marks and
exclamation points are also frequent, though their usage is not consistent. Korean questions are
typically marked by something specitrc in the sentence, such as the final postmodit'ier yl in -. (ha)nunpARTt 2lA Reference Grammar of Koreanyu, usually spelled as an unanalyzed ending -. (ha)nunya, and the interrogative ending -(su)p.nikka in
-. hap.nikka. For questions so marked there is no need for a question mark, though many writers put
one in, anyway. When the interrogation is otherwise unmarkecl in speech, a rising intonation indicates
a question, and such questions are appropriately wrinen with a question mark: Kim scrsayng? Pap
mek.e? If the question mark is reserved to mark only those questiorui that have a rising intonation, we
can write the distinction that is heard with indeterminates, i.e. words that have both interrogative and
indefinite meanings: Nwu ka woss.ey yo. 'Who is here?'
Nwu ka w:rss.ey yo? 'ls someone here?'
Koreans now ordinarily write both these sentences with a question mark, just as at one time they would
have written them with a period (or no punctuation); the spoken distinction is lost in the writing.
In this book the question mark is used only for sentences with rising intonation. The period is
used at the end of statements and questions with falling intonation, but it is usually omitted when the
sentence is cited as an example with the English translation immediately following. See $2.8 for other
intonations that might be marked.
In some cases, the grammatical analysis used in this book is more detailed than tbat rellected in
the Hankul spelling systems. As a result, there are some word divisions that produce spellings at
variance with tho prescriptions of Korean grammarians, such as -un ya for Hankul -unya, -um ulo for
Hankul -umulo, -um ey for Hankul -umoy. The grammatical lexicon of Pan ll carries most of the
usual Hankul forms with cross references to the spellings I prefer: -unya + -un ya.
In one or two other cases I have chosen to regularize forms that differ from those favored by the
Korean grammarians. I prefer the colloquial -â‚¬ as the shape for the infinitive aftet stems ending irt
...aC- (tat.e) rather than the literary/dialect version -a favored by the grammarians, lhough I realize
many younger speakers are tending to model their speech aller the spelling. I prefer the colloquial hsy
as the infinitive of hn- rather than the literary ha.ye favored by grammarians. But the literary forms
are discussed and cross-referenced. Another dilference of opinion, more controversial: I do not
recognize the validity of a distinction between -te' and -tr.r' in certain retrospective endings, and
accordingly I treat all cases of-te as literary or dialect variants of-tu-.","[28, 29]"

11.7.8. Negative sentences with positive force.
In negative questions usetl rhetorically the intended tbrce is positive: Kaci anh.el,! 'lsn't he ttlE
going?' or 'He's going, isn't he?' = 'Surely he is going'. Such sentences allow the suspective tbrm of ;-It*,dili
#,u'-ap,qRrA Reference Grammar of Korearrr 323ilrc past antl the futurelrntl even the copula: Kass.ci unh.e?!'Surely he went', Klkeyss.ci anh.e?!
'Surely he will go', tlaksayng ici (itss.ci) lnh.e?! 'Surely he is (w:rs) il srudent'. As statemens (or
nunrhetorical negarive questions), thgse sentences mus! be Kuci lnh.rss.e, Kaci anh.keyss.e, and
I{aksayng i an' ye(ss.e). (With the proper question intonation, those sentences can function
rhetorically, too.) The -ri anh- structure is commonly shonened to -c'anh-. The rhetorical use of
negative questions extends to expressions of doubt, t'ear, or anxiety: Kass.ci anh.ulq ka kekceng
sulepta 'l am afraid/worried that he may have gone'. For more on this. see Kim Tongsik 1981.
I 1.8. Nominalizations.
Nominalization is the process of taking a sentence and turning it into a nomind phrase that can be
used in some larger sentence ui a single noun nright be used:Poki (ka crih.tu) 'Lrxrking (is nicc = is nice-looking)'.
Ponta 'tle kxrks at it'
Plywuki (ka elyeptl)'To lelrn it (is hard)'.
l'aywunta'He lcarns
Oki (lul palantu) '(we hope) that he is coming'.
Orrla 'He is coming'
Chamka haki (lul kircel hanta) '(He refuses) to participate'.
Chamka hanta 'He panicipares'
As these examples show, one common nominalization uses the suMtttATtvE form (stem + -ki):
poki; cdh.ta
ponl:r
cip iki. Another common nominalization uses an
cdh,ki; cip ita
cwunun kes ul
ADNONflNALIZATION ($ I1.9) + kes 'thing, one, tact, act, ... ': cwunta 'He gives it'
(= cwuki lul) cwuce hanta'He hesitates to give it'. @arlier Korean used the substantive form -um
tbr that kintl of nominllizltion. See below.)
The nominalized senrence can be treated much Iike any noun. lt can be followed by a particle, by
another nominal which it moditres (na-kaki ccn'befbre going out', 6ps.ki ttaymun 'because there
were none'), by various parricles, antl occasionally by the copull: ileh,key haki 'ta 'Let's decide to do
it this way'. Nominalizations wirh ke; are especially flexible in use, and they occur freely predicated
by the copuh, sometimes with special meanings: Yeki se n' iSmpay lul an phinun kes ita 'It's a
matter of not smoking here = It's No Smoking here'. For further examples, see kes and -ki in Pan II.
The nominalized sentence may already contain adjuncts of its own (subjecs, objects, etc.), so that
when it is turned into a nominal that is used itselfas an adjunct ofthe matrix sentence into which it is
embedded you will sometimes find a sequence of phrases each marked with the same particle. In such
cases the prrtisle after the nominalization ot'ten drops: Chayk ul ilk.ki (lul) cdh,a hanun ya? 'Do you
enjoy reading books?'; Phyenci lul ssuki (lul) sicak hrnta'He stans to write the letter'.
A less common nominalization is marle with the sUBsTANTIVE form (stem -um/-m). Aside
tiom the sentence-t'inal use in the DocuruENTARY style ($tt.3), and certain somewhat literary idioms
(see -um ey and -um ulo in Part II), most cases of -um are single verbs or adjectives turned into
nouns. But sometimes a larger source sentence is involved:
IvtIl i ani 'ta 'lt is not languagc' Sayngkak i kot mtrl i ani 'm kwa kath.i ... 'Just as thought isit'*+**-***not language, ... '.","[318, 319]"

A Reference Grammar of Korean is a description of the language spoken in both nonh and south
Korea in the second half of the 20rh century. This material is given historical perspective by a
description of the structure of the language of the Hankul texts of the second half of the fifteenthcentury and somewhat later, here called Middle Korean (MK); occasional reference is made to still
earlier forms of the language, for which we have only very limited materials in the form of Chinese
characters used for their sound value (i.e. as phonograms) or inferences that ue made from systematic
irregularities in the grammar of the earliest Hankul texts. Anention is paid also to dialect variation
reported for the modern language and errlier speech. The core of the modern material reflects the
pronunciation and usage of speakers who were born in Seoul betbre 1950, but thrt has been updated by
observations of the speech habits of younger speakers, both in Seoul and elsewhere. ln addition to
direct elicitation, tape recordings, anrt written materials, VCR tapes of quite recent Seoul TV programshave provided authentic data of the contemporary usages referred to in various sections of the book.
The sentences are presented in a Romanized form which can be readily converted to a Hankul
representation, but they are intended to write spoken language, and do not dways coincide with theprescribed speltings. The reader should be aware that Romanized forms such as pat.e and iss.ey yo are
not misukes, but represent the relaxed pronunciation of the Seoul speakers who have provided or
checked them, rhough the speakers would indeed themselves write the words with the usually seen
spellings 'pat.a' and 'iss.e yo-, following the pronunciations heard in other areas and increasingly
among younger speakers in
r
Although a good deal is said about the history of sounds and forms, this work does not address
questions of prehistory or genetic relationships. When references are made to Japanese, Chinese, or
English data the intention is usually to show how the Korean counterparts are similar or different, or toseoul.add perspective on the meaning.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

We might expect that these verbs of 'becoming"" would lack rhe command anrl suggestion tbrms,
hut the only limitations seem to be semantic: Com lc ippe cye la 'Get a linle prenierl'; Te ippe cici
nrul'c la 'Don't ger any prettier' (by way ot'ippe cici nrrls hanla 'can't get anv pretticr'): (Corn te)

Notice that iss.ta (lill.7.l) in the meaning'stays'has only the lul preemphasis: iss.ci lul
anh.nunta 'doesn't sTAY' (*iss.ci ka anh.nunta). In the meanings 'is (rt)' and 'has (gor)' hrnh kinds
of preemphasis are possible, but with 'hlrs (got)' they are apparently limited to cenlin tilrms of the
auxilirry, such u; unh.e.
Though negative preemphasis might be expected wirh the double negative ($11.7.6), instead we
usually fintl the tbcus subdued (i.e. deemphasized) with the particle un/nun, as in ai tul i 6ps.ci nun
anh.e to'although he does.Not lack children = although he DoEs have chilclren'. (You will also find
focus highlighting with -ci to rnh- and -ci to mds ha-'not even/either', and restriction with -ci maft
anh- 'not just'. I lack an example of -ci man m6s ha- 'not just' but I see no reason nor to expect it,
too: Part II has -ci pakk ey mos ha-.) we also tind, however, Kulenq il iops.ci lul anh.e iss.tr

:i
but Cdh.ci anh.ci ka anh.tn sometimes occurs, in contexts rppropriate to Crih.ci anh.ci
The copula lacks a long negrtive (except in rhetorical questions), so there can be no preemphasis.
But notice the normal marking of the complement noun with i/ka betbre rni 'ta in contrast with ib
obligltory absence betbre itir. The t'act that the coputa negative will allow particle sequences otherwisd

â‚¬-I 1.3. Style conversions.
Koreans speak in diftirent sryLEs dcpending on the person with whom they are talking. The style
chosen shows something ahout the social rapport which the speaker t'eels to exist between himself and
the person he is addressing. The stylization of a sentence dittbrs, of course, ttom the insenion of the
honoritic marker -usi-/-si-, in thlt the verbs containing the honoritic show a special detbrence toward
the suBJEcT of the verb tbrm, and that subject may or may not be the same as thc person to whom one
is speaking. Honorit'ic t'urms occur in eLu styles of speech. lf you are talking to a chikl about his
teacher, you might use thc eLAIN style, but a! the same time insert the honorit'ic marker tirr each verbwhich has the teacher tbr a subject.
Euch style is mlrketl hy the choice olthe tjnal verh expression in the sentence. Each ofour threc
scntcncc typris can bc altcrcd tiorrr the hasic, pllin-stylc tirrms by doing something to the inflccted
word (Ponta; Coh.ta; -.itr). Thc possible sentence-t-rnal typcs are realized through the finite-moodA Reference Grammar of Kottan300 p,rnt Ishi6s of $l 1.5, where all of the shapes are presented. The full range possible tirr kinds of ending

"The name'infinitive"" is here applierl to the ending typicrlly shaped -e, and the forms made by
attaching the appropriate shape to verb stems. The ret'erence should not be confused with the use of
that term in talking about the grammar of other languages, though it has been applied to a very similar
form in Japanese. English speakers name verbs by the translation of the Latin infinitive 'to "" but
Koreans name a verb by the indicative assertive -.la even when that form is not otherwise in use, as is
true when mekta is replaced by mek.nunta 'eats', with obligatory marking as a processive verb.
The Korean infinitive is used in the tbllowing ways:
(l) by iaelfat the end ofa nontlnal clause to mean'and so'or'and then';
(2) as a connecting form used with an auxilirry verb ($7.5) or to link two ordinary verbs in a kind of
*regular
compound"", such as il.e na-'get up', na o- + nt-{F'come out', al.e tut-'understand', ... ;
(3) followed by the panicle se with about the same meaning as (l), but more colloquial;
(4) followed by the particle ya with the meaning 'only if
' in such expressions irs -â‚¬ ya ha- and -e
ya toy-'only if we - will itdo' ='wehave to (do it)';
(5) followed by the particle to with the meaning 'even though ' in such expressions as
to coh'be all right even if (one does)' = 'may (do), it is all right (to do)';
(6) followed by the particle la to make a command in the unquoted plain style;
(7) by itself at the end of a sentence to present a statement, question, command, or suggestion in rhe
rNrrNrArE sryle ($l 1.3);
(8) tbllowed by the particle yo at the end of a sentencc to present a statement, question, command, or
suggesrion in the poLtre style (|il 1.3).
The typical shape ofthe intinitive ending is -e, but the shape is -a when the last vowel ofthe stem
is o or a w which is reduced from a basic o, such as wi
o- + -a 'comes'. For stems ending in -.ahthe usual infinitive is -.ah.a pronounced /aal, as in tih.a'arrives'
but tih.e (pronounced /taae/) is
sometimes heard. For ambivalent stems the intinitive is -ay, coming from hay, the intjnitive of ha-, as
in Emulay
(p)p6.ye(hF 'be misty' is usually treated as (p)p0.Jey and
Amule(h)-, but (p)pii.yay
pronounced /(p)puey/ ($4.3). The int'initive of the inseparable postnominal adjective low- 'be
(characterized by)' is regularly lowa, but there is a conrmon colloquial variant lowe; lt is perhaps to be
explained by the older tbrm ot'low- which is said to have been lowup (or perhaps lowuw-?). ln the
literary language, in literary clichtis in the colloquial, in dialects, and in the standardizing prescriptions
of the Korean Language Society the entling is -a if the last vowel of the stem is /a/, as well as if it is
lol, aruJ occasiona.lly in texts we trnd -t usetl after other vowels (Cr the colloquial variant ia = ie'it
is'). We can treat pat.a as a variant tbr the Seoul pat.e, but tiom tlre point of view of the Korean
Language Society, pat.e is a colloquial variant of pat.a. The Seoul tbrm has been around a while:
l8E7 Scon 107 has patela'rcceive [itj!' despite the tirst tbrm in (id, 160) pas.lcwua (= /pakkwa/)
'wolna'la).
wonela = pakkwe one la
There are eleven special comments to be made regarding alternations of stem and infinitive
ending. The t'irst six of these apply correspondingly to the attachment of the past marker (typically
-ess-) as well as to the int'initive (typically -c). Statements 7 through I I do not apply to the past marker.",[251]

"pmrr 297A Reference Grammar of KoreanThe chrtice of particular classes of nouns to precetle the copull ita and of particular classes of
ldjectives and verbs will impose constrainB upon the choice of wortJs elsewhcre in the sentence. We
do not say *K!ly ka Kim sensayng_ul cwuk.nunla'The dog dies Mr Kim' nor, except by a special
dispensation called 'personification"", Kiing i ayki lul ponta 'The ball looks at the baby'. But in our
choice of a particular one of the three nuclear sentence types, we impose much broader constraints
upon the kinds of operations possible, and that is why we need all three types, even though the
predicates oithe second and third type may be regarded as restricted subclasses oithe tirst.
(2) We can EXPAND the sentence. by prethcing the predicate with one or more adverhial phra.ses
lnd/or. in the sase of the copular sentence. by prethcing the noun with an adnominal phrase:
(Cikum) (emeni ka) ayki lul poNTA 'Now the morher looks at the baby'.
(Yeki se) cip i KilUTA 'The houses are large (here)'.
(Ku kes i) wuli ctp rTA 'Thar (thing), it is our house'.
We do not look at the structure of the phrases themselves as converted; we do not set up 'kernel
phrases"" from which the others are derived by a series of operations, since the operation would consist
merely of adrlition. However, parts of phrases that are themselves derived from sentences, such as
moditjer phrases, will include conversions listed below. It would be possible, of course, to assign sontewhat arbitrarily**a kind of kernel sentence that would derive each phrase so that noun
subject
marker could be obtained from the kernel sentence Ayki ka ponta 'The baby looks at it', but that
procedure seems both unnatural and unnecessary
(3) We can coNvERT or transfbrm the sentence by applying somewhat interdependent processes:
L status elevation: normal honorific.
2. style shift: plain
formal,
semiformal (authoritative),
familiar,
intimate (including
intimate casual and circumstantial), + polite (including polite casual and circumstantial).
3. tense-aspect shift: present (or timeless)
past,
frtture.
tentative,
retrospective; and
combinations of these.
4. finite-mood shift: statement + question, + command,
proposition, + apperception.
5. voice shift: active + causative,
passive.
6. negation: aftirmative + negative. + strong negative.
7. condensation: sentence
nominalizatiolt, + 3.1no*'nalization,
atlverbialization.
8. quotation: sentence
quoted sentence.
A basic form is postulated tbr each category and labeled above as 'normal, plain. present, statement,
active, atfirmative sentence', to which all three of our nuclear sentences correspond. The other forms
mentioned are considered as produced by some process of derivation from the basic form.
(4) We can transform the ExPANstoNs ofexpanded sentences by means ofthe following processes:
9. switching emphasis (order of the expansions). We are assuming no ""normal' order, but that
may be untenable, since there is usually a least marked version, such as rnrE - pLAcE - suBJEcT -+**+****++** --OBLIQUE OBJECTS . DIRECT OEJECT . VERB.10. subdual offocus (wirh the particle un/nun).

"Qurttations rre tiequent in Korean. Quoted is not only wh:rt people have said. hut also what the""quotation""is merely a grammatical
speirker thinks or intentjs (-ulye ko lrantl), antl s()mctimes the
reporting the exact
device that is used ttr lengthen, soften, or emphasize a sentence. Direct quotaiion-is not common in conversation, and in books it is usually introduced by the tbrmula A ka
words
mdl haki lul -' 'A's saying [as tlirect ohjectl'and ended by the tbrmula hako (mnl) hayss.ta'said'or
just hrko'saying'as an afterth0ught scntcncâ‚¬ (ii11.3.5). Another way to state rd.irect quoErtion is to
.- (i)la ko (mal) hayss.ta 'sai,l ['that it is']' or just
appen.l to tfrj quoteA sentence the expression
... hil-yss.t! 'stid' (King 1988a). This rreats the quoted sentence (or tiagment) as if it were a noun, antl
scems ro be a tairly recent innovation. Since vinually all trnite verb tbrms end in a vowel, the pseudo
parricle ila ko is nearly always heard in the postvocllic shape'lu ko, anrl some speakers feel
uncomtirrtable identitying it wirh ila ko. When l juncture is insened between the quoted sentence and
the quoting verb phrase, the abbreviation 'la ko remains and is not restored to ila ko: ""Eps.""up.nita""
| 'la ko hayss.ta 'said, 'There are none""'. But that just shows that the juncture is inserted late in the
process of phonetic realization anil is somewhat artit'luial. When the quoled sentence ends in a
.onronunt, only rhe full tbrm ilir ko can be pronounced: ""Son nim i osyess.kwumen"". ila ko hayss.ll
or ""Son nim i osyess.kwun"" ila ko hayss.tl 'sairl, 'Why, a guest has arrived!-'; ""C5mqkan man
kitalilyem"" ila ko hayss.ta 'said, 'Why tlon't you just wait a little bit?""'.

reporting the gist
lndirect quotations
rerbrence, honoritjcs, etc. A person will not use honoritics about himselt', but in quoting what he has
said I may well want to use honoritics about his acts and intentions, and I will remove any honorific
or reducetl back to the plain style from
ret'erences to mc. The sentence is lclr in the pLatn style
whatever stylization i! may have untlcrgone. But in quotntions the plain style copula changes from ittt
to ila and the command changes from -c h to the subjunctive attentive -ula/-la, as in these examples:----Cip ita. 'It is a house.' Cip ilu ko hayss,ta 'He said it is/was a house'or'He called it a house'.
illek.ula ko hayss,ta 'He told me to eat'.
I\tek.e la! 'Ert!'
Notice thlr the English trrnslltion trf -ula ko hunta is otien 'tells one lo do it' and the translation ol
-ca ko hanla is often 'suggests doing it'.
Quoted questions are always in thc -1un ;'a vcrsion of the plain tirrms (-nun ya, -keyss.nun ya,
-eis.nun ya) and -un ya is used only tor the presdnt adjectives and copula, so that cOh.to + cdh.un yl
(ko) but c6h.keyss.ta
- cuh.keyss.nun ya (ko). The tbrm -ul ya is used only in literary questions,
usually rhetorical. A somewhat bookish variant tbr quoting adjective and copula questions uses -un ka
instead of -un ya: Illusun mnl in ka (ko) mul.ess.ta = Musun mil in ya (ko) mul.cs.ta 'He uked
which word it was (or: what the talk was all about)'.
What is quoted is tbllowerl by a verb of saying (telling, inquiring) or of thinking (opinion,
intention): miil hanta or just hrntr 'says', m[t.nunta (mul.e) 'asks, inquires', cwucang hanta
'claims', myâ‚¬ng.lyeng hanta 'orders, commantls', sayngkak hanta 'thinks', - . Optionally the
panicle ko can be attachetl to show the end of the quoted content. If the quoting verb is omined the
quotittion is lett as a fiagment, or ""afrerthought"", antl the particle ko is used to enrl the sentence.
ln atttlition to the sentencc-tlnal tbrnrs (stltcnrent, questitrn, command, suggestion - but not the
apperceptive), the intentive is also indirecrly quoted: -ulye (ko) hanta 'tbels lhat one would like to do;
has it in mind (hu the intention) io dtr; tries/stans to do; will do'. Common variants, often regarded
as nonstandard, are -ulya/-lya antl -ull:r/-llu + hrnta or an abbreviation ofthat structure which leads
to the contracted tbrms -ulla 'nta, -ulll 'y, .- . The tamiliar question fbrm -ulq ka is quoted with the
meuing 'is thinking of doing, is wontlering whether to do', as in Kllq kl hanla 'l am thinking of
going'. The intentive -ulye/-lye, ir should be noted, probably cttmes tiom the prospective moditier -ul
a a vlriant ol ya 'question'. Quotation also underlies -nulu ko rnd -ulla ko'
Sincc rhe quotation rnay, but ncetl n(rt, includc the plrticlc ko, we can speak of a stlvlPLE quotation
(-ta hunta ctc.) lnd ln EXpANDED (lu()tation (-ta ko hanla ctc.). ln atldition, there is an ABBREVIATEDA Reference Grammar of Kortan332 penr tquotation matle with contracted tttrms tlt h:r-: 'til 'ntl. -h 'nll. -ul 'nh. -nun ya 'ttta. ... , The fOrm
-ulye'nta is an abbreviated version of-ulye hrnta lntl the explnded version is -ulye ko hanla.
These remarks rctbr to inttirect quotltion. ln addititrn n) thc three kinds of intlirect quotationthere is also direct quotrrion with the particle hako or the pseudo'
simple, expandetl, and abbreviated
particle ila ko. A direct quotation can be reported as sAlD by anyone, including the spelker, but it can
te reported as THoUCHT only by the speaker. An indirect quotation. on the other. hand. can be reported
as thought or saitl by unyuni. ln illidrlle Korean both direct and indirect quotrtions were made in the
same sieral ways ind iould be differentiaterl only by the words within the quoted sentence, such 35
the pronouns, deictics, and verbal endings. Thl quotation was optionally marked hy ho'ya, lhe
int'initive of ""lro-'do; be; say', here functioning like modern huko, and followed by a verb of saying;
if the verb of saying was thi minimal ""fto- itself, the quotation stood unmarked; like modern hako,
'/roya could not be used when immediately tbllowed by a tbrm of the same stem,,and it was optional
'i'l4 'lc'
only before the other verbs of saying. tvlidile Korean also had a naming construction NAlvtE

sometimes hear -upsio for -usio after a consonant (ilk.upsio = ilkusio 'read it!'), and -sio sounds
the same as -usi yo, variant of -usey yo + -usye yo used for polite-style commands and propositions

ilk.usio); such forms are nonstandard. rYr Ungpayk 196l:565 draws an artificial distinction between

Some of the Chinese nouns which have the earmarks of tteedom, being of two or more syllables,
are nonetheless restricted to positions modi$ing a noun or noun phrase, and occasional examples in
other positions are to be dismissed as awkward at best. Among these 'quasi-adnouns"" are the det'ectiveverbal nouns ($5.6.2) that have only the modifier form: tiiymo han 'prominent', miimo hrn
'celebrated', ... . For'unique'we finrl both yuil htn and yuil uy (as in - mokcek'unique goal'); also
yuil mui han (less commonly yuil mui uy) 'unique and unmatched'.

(3) The bound postnoun cek '-ic' produces compounds which are somewhat like quasi-adnouns that
do not take uy, but they can also occur:
betbre ulo, as in kwshsktek ulo 'scientitically';before forms of the copula especially the modit'ier, as in kwahak-cek (in) thAyto 'a scientiflic
aftitude' and thiyto ka kwahak<ek ita 'has a scientific anitude';
before the nominative marker i/ka when tbllowed by a negativized copula expression: th6yto ka
kwuhak-cek i ani 'ta 'does not have a scienlitic attitudd'.
(,1) The bound postnoun sling '--wise, with respect to' (the basic vowel length of the morpheme is
usually suppressed when it functions this way) creates sompounds that are often used like adnouns, but
they may be separated ttorn dre morliticd noun by the copula moditier in or (more commonly) by the
particlc uy, as in I ke n' kycngccy-snng (uy) mincey 'la ko polq swu iss.ta 'This can be looked at as
a question relevant to economics'. (Contrast the behavior of cek '-.ic', which never occurs with uy.)
The compounds also occur before various particles, but usually the particles are present because they
are required by later elements ofthe sentence. The sing compounds, unlike the cek compounds, do not
occur as predicate complement with -. ita 'it is - ', nor with most conversions of the copula other than
the adnominal in (and substitution by uy is more common) and such adverbial conversions as ina and
the negative ani 'la. See the entry in Pan II tbr examples.","[150, 151]"

"==2.5. Syllable structure and consonant liaison.
The Korean syllable is a phonetic entity that is automatically predictable in terms of a string of
phonemes: it consists of an initial (the onset), a medial (the vowel or diphthong), and a final (thecoda).Theonsetcanbezeroorpppphtttthkkkkhcccchssshmn-ng(-)l;-mh,-nh,-ngh,-lh. The final can be zero or p t k m n ng l. The Korean writing system, and our'transcription, has
other finals in its 'onhographic"" syllahles, but those rre basic forms subject m reduction in tlre spoken
syllables. lvlodern Hankul uses the slme symbol tbr initial 'zero"" and linal ...ng, though tlistinctive
symbols were once used; the final zero is left unmarked, though it was marked in some of the earliest
Hankul texts.
Not all possible combinations of initial, medial, and final occur. Medials beginning with y (yey
yay ye ys yu yo) do not occur after s ss c ch cc t th tt except :rs contractions from i
vowel (ey lay
ie ia iwu io)
see $3.5.(9), or in a few recent loanwords such as syassu (also syaccu and syechu)
'shirt' for which the less Japanese-sounding sassu is also herrd. The vowel u does not occur after a
labial (p ph pp m) and that is why we can abbreviate the vowel wu to u after a labial, so that our*-""pu"" = p + wu,'phu' = ph t- rvu,'ppu"" = pp f rvu. tn a similarwayour'yu"" = y + rvusince there is no y + u. Medials that begin with w (rvi rvey wry rve wa) do not occur after a labial
except as abbreviations of wu or o + vowel (wui wuey wury rvue wua oa), as in mwe(s) < mue(s)'what'.
Whenever possible, a syllable shuns the ""zero"" initial. Korean syllables like to begin with a
consonant. When a syllable with the zero initial is appended to a syllable with a final consonant, that
consonant shiffs over to become the onset of the second syllable: pap + i is pronounced pa-pi, pang*+ ey is pronounced pa-ngey, pal ul is pronounced pa-lul and sounds just the same as pa lul.
When the second syllable begins with h, the result is what we would expect from our transcription: -.p*+++ h.- -.ph-. etc. ln rapid speech we even t'ind -.m (-.n -ng .-l) + h-. .-mh-. (etc.), though
the h frequently drops in this position. When the first syllable ends in p, t, or k anrl the second syllable
begins with the same consonant, the tirst syllable loses its tinal and the initial of the secontl syllable
doubles:
+ p... .-pp-., etc. (For the facr rhar
k-.
-.pkk..., .-t + k-.
-.kk-., -.t +
s-.
'.ss-., etc., see the following section.)
How many distinct syllables does Korean have? It is difficult to answer this question precisely.
Suppose we figure that the initials (including zero and l-) are 20 (+ 5 in spoken syllables like -ngi,
-mha, etc. = 25), that the medials are 20 (omitting uy because of its limited distribution and doubtful
status as a phoneme), and that tlre finlls (including zero) are 8. Then we have a minimum (20x20x8=)
3,200 and a matimum of (25x20x8=) 4,000. Fronr tlese tigures we would perhaps want to subtract
the syllables that do not occur in spoken words, but many such syllables will in t'act turn up in Hankul+-p--p i--30 parr tA Refereuce Grammar of Koreanspellings, tbr one reason or another, and in addirion Hankul has a number of onhognphic syllables
with additional basic tinals (such as ph th kk ps ls etc.) :rnd some unusual syllrbles like sya cye
chyess, etc. There are undoubtedly some accidental gaps that do not occur in normal words. Perhaps
we are safe in saying thar Korean has between three and tbur thousrnd dift'erent syllables, some of
which are fairly rare, and many of which are limited to certain sections of the vocabulary, such as
Chinese loanwords, intlecterl tbrms, and mimetic words (onomatopes).","[33, 34]"

The meanings of present, past. and luture conversions are sometimes at variance with what the
label seems to call for; see the entries -keys.s.ta and -es.s- in Part ll. Examples given by CM l:316-7
show the present used for (l) permanent or habitual; (2) t'uture, especirlly definite expectation with
verbs of departure and arrival; (3) historical present; (4) command-like instructions, such as recipes or
stage directions; (5) citing a series of actions. For more on the retrospective, see p. 325.
Korean resembles English rather than Japanese in expressions of the type acik an /mOs V-ess.ta
'has not yet V-ed'. ln Japanese the nonpast negative will appear in such sentences ($a'dai!!gD.
11.5. Nlood conversions.iIn speaking of mood conversions we use the term 'mood"" in a somewhat narrower sense than
before, to ret'er to the finite moods. Specitically, we treat the sTATEMENT as basic and regard each of
as a conversion from that.
question, command, proposition, and apperception
the other moods
Because of the complexities of form taken in the various styles ($11.3), I have prepared a table to
display the forms used for each category and it includes also the retrospective forms ($l 1.4) because of
their interrelated complexities. In the tahle an arrow pointing up means ""use the simple statement
form, perhaps with a different intonation"". An arrow pointing to the left means 'use a form from a less
polite style"", one pointing to the right means 'use a form from a more polite style"". An arrow pointing
both lett antl right means'use either a less or a more polite style"". The difference between the styles is
not entirely a gradation ofpoliteness as such. to be sure, but tbr the purposes ofthis table we will so
consider it. Some categories offer several possibilities, for which there is generally a slight difference
in usage; the options are cited here in the order of the relative frequency with which they are chosen.
The table on p. 306 summarizes the facts that are discussed in detail, style by style, in later sections. In
the table Okwun represents also G)kwumen and kulye represents also kwulye.
There are several colloquial and dialect forms that do not appear in the table, such as -(su)pci yo,
'(u)psey, -la kwu, -ca kut, ... . They will be found as individual entries in Part lI.",[301]

"2.9. Intonations.
The tbllowing statements about intonation tbllow the analysis in Martin 1954 1= KM). Every
phrase or utterance of more than one syllable has a gradual nondistinctive rise throughout until the
onset of a particular intonation, which occurs near the end of the phrase and in conjunction with a
pause. The meaning of statement, question, suggestion, and command are sometimes carried (in whole
or in pan) by tlre intonation, but often these meanings are wholly or partly expressed by morphs in the
ending of the verb tirrm.
Seven intonations are recognized for Seoul speech:
l. PERIoD intonation (.): a fall, beginning on the third, second, or last syllable from the end ofthe
sentence (if on the last syllable this intonrtion is homophonous with 4).
2. coMMA intonation (,); a rise on the last syllable of a phrase.
3. QUEsrtoN-MARK intonation (?): a rise on the third, second, or last syllable from the end of the
sentence (if on the last syllable the intonation is homophonous with 2).
4. ExcLANrATroN-potNT intonation (!): a quick tall on the last syllable of the sentence, often
accompanied by a voice qualitier of overlouclness.
5. DoUBLE euEsTtoN-trrARK intonation (??): a dip on the third, second, or last syllable ftom the
end of the sentence (homophonous with 7 when on the last syllable).",[45]
