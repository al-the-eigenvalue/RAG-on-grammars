"10.5.1 Polar interrogatives
Polar interrogatives are those that seek an expression of affirmation or negation of
the truth of the questioned proposition. The response sought to a polar interrogative
is either an affirmation or negation of the proposition. There are no words for 'yes'
and 'no' in the interrogative context. This is achieved by means of an echo system,
i.e. the partial repetition of the predicate. A sub-type is the alternative interrogative
(Sadock and Zwicky 1985), which provides a list of constituents, or a proposition
and its negation, to which the respondent must make a choice. There are three
interrogative morphemes associated with polar interrogatives: tah ' Q \ expressing
doubt, 'who knows', 'maybe' (§10.5.1.1); kah 'ALT' expressing possible alternatives
andbeh 'NO' the external negator meaning 'or not?' (§10.5.1.2).
10.5.1.1 Intonation interrogatives
Any declarative clause may become a question by using rising intonation over the
relevant constituent. In the first example it is over the verb ?ris 'to live':
(275)?ma?bapa? ?ris?

be.alive
Are your parents alive?",[353]

"Hi. The mirative in interrogative clauses The irrealis can occur in interrogative
clauses of the information type. This is in contrast to examples of the interrogative
examined in the literature which all involve polar interrogatives (Mithun 1995,
Givon 1994), and not information interrogatives as is the case here. Givon attributes
the presence of the irrealis in polar questions to the epistemic sub-mode of low
certainty (1994: 273). Cross-linguistically, there are two options behind the
motivation for the irrealis in interrogatives: a) the interrogative can show the same
sort of sensitivity to mood as the declarative, real or unreal; or b) it can consistently
mark all interrogatives as irrealis on the basis that they have not been realised. The
latter is not the case in Semelai as all interrogatives with the exception of those
discussed here are generally in the realis.
In Semelai the presence of the irrealis in an interrogative clause could express one
of two things: a) mirative, a speaker-based expression of an event counter to
normality, or b) inferred, where the speaker cannot infer the person's motive. Either

Although the discussion of interrogative pronouns precedes the indefinite
pronouns, their function in the interrogative clause is but one of these functions, and
while it is the most basic and accessible function, it should not necessarily be
considered primary. Note that cross-linguistically, indefinite pronouns tend to be the
more marked category relative to the forms used in the interrogative function

To 'tell riddles' is b-ttikyan.The term comes from the Malay teka teki 'riddles,

family, ranging from an elderly couple to their young grandchildren. The session
began spontaneously when we were sitting around one evening and someone
happened to ask me one of these riddles. Everyone then proceeded to join in, taking
great delight in my attempts to come up with the correct answers.
Each clue is presented here together with the answer (A:). The riddles are not only
entertaining, but provide interesting insights into the Semelai perception of their

The internal negator da? 'NEG' and

negation (§10.4.1).
The adverbials are lagi? 'still, yet', the otherwise unattested wo? 'longer' and the
modifying serial verb cerj 'completely'.

"1.1 Linguistic type
Semelai exhibits many of the typological characteristics of a mainland Southeast Asian
language, as well as incorporating aspects of Austronesian, notably from sustained
contact with Malay. Whilst there has been considerable impact from Malay,
particularly at the lexical level, Semelai remains a distinctly mainland Austroasiatic
language, but at the same time raises questions with respect to our understanding of
the typology of this region.
A. Phonology Semelai has a rich phonemic inventory. There are thirty-two
consonant phonemes, including a series of voiceless nasals which have not been
recorded previously in an Aslian language; a series of glottalised sonorants, and
twenty vowel phonemes: ten oral vowels and ten phonemically nasal counterparts
(§2.1).
The maximal canonical syllable is [CV(C)]CT. Phonemic contrasts of both
consonants and vowels are richest in the final syllable; for consonants these contrasts
are maximised in the onset of the final syllable.
Words have the structure: co —» (crR)n (a) 'a, where: n < 2. Reading from the right,
'a is the final syllable - word stress is always on the final syllable, and there is no
secondary stress, a is the penultimate syllable and aR is the prepenultimate syllable.
The r indicates significantly reduced phonotactic possibilities for both consonants and
vowels, including the characteristic underspecification of vowels associated with this
position. Any oral vowel phoneme has the potential to occur as the phonetic realisation
of an underspecified vowel in a given environment.
The minimal word is monosyllabic, e.g. /t h i/ 'hand', the maximal word is
tetrasyllabic: /k .r .wan.cerj/ [keruwancerj] 'coral snake sp.'
B. Morphology Semelai is an isolating language with agglutinating features.
Typically for the Aslian family, but at variance with many Mon-Khmer languages,
Semelai has a complex morphological system, containing a rich inventory of prefixes,

"1.2 The Aslian languages
Aslian languages are a sub-group of the Mon-Khmer language family. Along with
Munda, Mon-Khmer is one of the two divisions that forms the Austroasiatic phylum.
Austroasiatic languages are spread throughout mainland Southeast Asia, Northeast
India and the Nicobar Islands.
The Austroasiatic languages have a long presence in this area, predating the
Sino-Tibetan, Tai-Kadai, Miao-Yao, Austronesian, Dravidian and Indo-European
families with which they coexist today. With the exception of three Mon-Khmer
languages, Vietnamese, Khmer and Khasi (Assam, India), the languages are spoken
by ethnic minorities.
The Mon-Khmer language family extends from Vietnam in the east, to Northeast
India in the west, and from Southern China in the north, to the Aslian languages in the
south, Semelai and Mah Meri (Besisi) being the southernmost members of the family.
Mon-Khmer is divided into twelve branches (Diffloth and Zide 1992), although the
preciserelationshipbetween the twelve is yet to be ascertained. As stated above, the
Aslian branch lies firmly within the Mon-Khmer division, and is not a distinct division
within Austroasiatic (Ruhlen 1986: 89-91). Aslian belongs in a Southern Branch
along with the Monic languages, and possibly also those of the Nicobar islands
(Diffloth p.c).
The question of internal subgroupings of Aslian is discussed in the following
section.",[38]

A particular lexicalised type of associative phrase is what I will label 'nominal
compounds'. Though phonologically indistinguishable, I distinguish them from
regular phrases because of the syntactic cohesiveness of the constituents as
mentioned in the introduction to §7.5 above.
Nominal compounds are formed by the syntactic juxtaposition of two nouns, in a
relationship Head-NP. The majority of nominal compounds in Semelai are syntactic
compounds of the associative phrase type.
7.5.4.1 Criteria for distinguishing compounds
It is difficult to find criteria for distinguishing compounds from simple associative
phrase constructions. In a sense, compounds are 'institutionalised' examples of the
associative phrase which, by virtue of being institutionalised, become cohesive
syntactic units.
As mentioned above, it is difficult to establish any firm phonological criteria for
differentiating compounds from the associative phrase, although perceptually
compounds are less likely to have an intervening pause.
In the text, compounds are indicated by a point between the lexemes, and are
glossed lexeme by lexeme in the interlinear gloss, but translated as a compound.
The most important point is that compounds are inaccessible to the rules of
syntax. In an associative construction, individual constituents of the phrase can be
independently modified, see (61) above.
In the case of compounds which have the semantic relationship of
possessee-possessor, relationship-person, or part-whole (73), the possessor cannot
be marked by the preposition do 'OF'. In (74) the compound does not retain its
meaning, in this case the meaning is nonsensical, as indicated by the question mark.

"2388 Prepositions and the prepositional phrase8.5,4 Core function
As noted in §8.3.4, the interpretation of the locative in a core role function signals
the indirect object of a verb of giving or oral communication. A deictic locative,
used instead of neutral ?en 'LOC', allows the speaker to encode deictic information
about the location of the recipient in relation to the speaker.
The following examples with the verb jon *to give' illustrate the contrasting
usage. In (73)-(74) the recipient is in the immediate location of the donor; in (75)
the donor is upstream.

about an elder male 'sibling', actually a first cousin, who had assisted the
Communist insurgents.
The Communist insurgents, who were Chinese, sought help from the Semelai in
order to negotiate their way through and survive in the jungle. The British rulers had
put a price on the head of anyone who aided and abetted the enemy. The
