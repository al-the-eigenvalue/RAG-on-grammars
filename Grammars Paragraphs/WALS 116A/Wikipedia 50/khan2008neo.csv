(A48:2)
""áw l7ðe ‘ádr6t bábe díyila ""êlla.} ‘He does not know whether it is his
father’s tent or not.’ (A28:33)19.2.2. Questions Introduced by an Interrogative Particle
Various subordinate clauses that are introduced by interrogative particles
may be classified as indirect questions. These are embedded under verbs
such as ‘to know’, ‘to see’, ‘to show’, ‘to say’ and ‘to write’, e.g.
(1)
(2)y8ð6t ""7k6n dêry6lle?} ‘Do you know where I put him?’ (A22:44)
lá maxzátle ""•lli ""7ka pàl6†?} ‘Won’t you show me where it comes out?’
(A24:38)
(3) xáze mòdila q•ßß6t.} ‘He sees what the problem is.’ (A22:43)
(4) làn-ða""a mo-qaríwale.} ‘I do not know what they called him.’ (A12:20)
(5) ga-l7ð6x . . . ""7nila ""ùrxa.} ‘But we do not know . . . which is the road.’
(A26:18)
(6) ""ína ""ána léyð6n b-7ni dána t-à°e xúwwe.} ‘But I do not know at what
time the snake will come.’ (A24:39)
(7) síq5le l-b5°-qòra,} gu-qawrà°a,} xáze ""7nila qáwra xà°ta.} ‘He went down
to the cemetery and among the graves he saw which (of them)
was a new grave.’ (A25:89)
(8) múr ""ˆni-m6nn6n} biš-šapìrt5la.} ‘Say which of us is the most beautiful.’
(A25:17)
(9) xzi-k6mà t-áz6l ""áwwa táwra.} ‘See how much this ox will go for.’ (A22:1)
(10) b8y6n t-y8ð6n ""ána ""íman mˆ°ena.} ‘I want to know when I shall die.’ (A16:1)
(11) l7la k°ìwe} ""ím6 t-íle bênya.} ‘They have not written when it was built.’
(B6:31)
If an indirect question clause that is introduced by an interrogative particle
contains a subject nominal or independent subject pronoun, this is often
placed before the particle, e.g.
(12) ""úp ""aláha la-y8ðe ""áti ""ìman m5°éti.} ‘Even God does not know when
you will die.’ (A16:11)
(13) ""áw xzèle ""o-dídwa ""7ka wìrre.} ‘He saw where the fly entered.’ (A11:9)
(14) ""u-šákr6x š•mm6t márya ""álaha xáz6x ""úrxa ""ˆk5la.} ‘We shall pray to the
Lord God that we may find where the road is.’ (A26:17)syntactic subordination of clauses977(15) ""6n-lá galêtli} róxux gu-mòdila} ""u-dáx-it xyà""a} ""ána xà-yoma k•slux la-p7š6n.}
‘If you do not reveal to me in what your spirit lies and how you
live, I shall not stay with you a single day longer.’ (A12:40)
The subject may be raised and made the object of the main verb. This
process is reflected by the pronominal object in (16) and (17) and the
object agreement pronoun in (18):
(16) ""an-š5r°†} láz6m y>ð•tla mòdila.} ‘You should know what these conditions are.’ (A24:10)
(17) ""7ni ""ítl5xu t-náše t-máßi mšáw°i mênna} xaz7la mà†ola?} ‘What people
do you have who can speak with her and find out how she is?’
(A4:13)
(18) t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla} xo-d-áwwa jùlla.} ‘He will come
and will know what these are (Literally: what these are and are
not) under this cloth.’ (A25:49)
A constituent that does not have the role of subject is occasionally extraposed before the interrogative particle, e.g.
(19) yába t-áz6x xàz6x} ""5-brat7ni mà m•nna.} ‘Let’s go and see what has
become of that daughter of ours.’ (A21:25)
In (20) the embedded interrogative clause is introduced by the complementiser qa-t:
(20) xzéwali qa-t-""ó-f6lsa ""7ka npìlle.} ‘I saw where the coin fell.’ (B15:34)
Interrogative particles are also used to express embedded exclamations, e.g.
(21) xzi-k6m7le lxìma!} ‘Look how fit he is!’ (A15:13)
(22) xzi-""ánna yále k6mà š6†ránela!} ‘Look how beautiful the children are!’
(A8:16)
Some speakers have the practice of introducing new information that is
regarded as worthy of particular attention by an interrogative word, to
which the new information supplies the answer. This question and answer
structure may sometimes be blended together and put in the same intonation group, with the result that the whole construction is most easily
interpreted as an assertion, e.g.","[1014, 1015, 1016]"
"syntactic subordination of clauses
(4)
(5)971""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo,} yawíwala mêšxa.} ‘When (literally: at the time that)
the bride came, they would give her oil.’ (B8:32)
""o-m6nn7xu t-dàq6r} b-M9mo} ‘whoever of you touches M>mo . . .’
(A26:68)When the referent of a definite antecedent noun has the role of direct
object in the relative clause it is resumed by a pronominal object pronoun,
whether the clause is restrictive or non-restrictive, e.g.
(6)
(7)""7-brat6t malušíwala jùlle} t-oðíwala ""ax-kàlo.} ‘They made the girl whom
they dressed in clothes like a bride.’ (B7:2)
m•re †la-Zìne,} t-b>yéla M9mo} ‘He said to Zine, whom M>mo loved’
(A26:64)The resumptive pronoun may be in a clause embedded within the relative clause, e.g.
(8)""7-baxta t-à°ya} b8y6n gawrênna} láz6m mtanyáli ða-q6ßßêtta.} ‘The woman
who comes and I shall marry must tell me a story.’ (A36:1)In the relative clause of (9) the clause embedded under the verb b>y6t ‘you
want’ that would have contained the resumptive pronoun has been elided:
(9)šêdla,} gu-d-a-""8ra t-b8y6t mattêtle.} ‘The sapling—you put it in the
land that you want (to put it in).’ (B5:103)When the antecedent noun is indefinite with a non-specific referent and
the relative clause is restrictive, there is generally no resumptive pronominal direct object, e.g.
(10) hálli xá-m6ndi t-àxl6n.} ‘Give me something to eat (literally: that I
may eat).’ (A26:57)
(11) kú-mdit t-yáw6l †làlux} ""áp ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l trè.} ‘Everything that he
gives to you, he will give also to your neighbour, twofold.’ (A3:4)
(12) kú-m6ndit b9y6t,} módi m>r8d lêbbux} t-oðànne!} ‘Whatever you want,
whatever your heart’s desire is, I shall do it!’ (A33:11)
(13) ""áwwa kú-mdit mßaw•°wa ’ùxo,} ’ùxo,} ’ùxo.} ‘Everything that he
spoke (= on every occasion that he spoke) (people would say) ’uxo,
’uxo, ’uxo.’ (A7:1)972chapter nineteenWhen the interrogative pronoun mo ‘what’ functions as an indefinite pronoun at the head of a restrictive relative, there is likewise no resumptive
object pronoun, e.g.
(14) mo-t-ámr6t wúð hàd6x.} ‘Do whatever you say (= whatever you think
best).’ (A8:17)
When, on the other hand, an indefinite antecedent noun has a specific
referent and the following clause is non-restrictive, a pronominal object
suffix is used, e.g.
(15) q6m-xazéle xa-nàša} mì°a} naból6lle m†amòr6lle.} ‘He saw a dead person,
whom they were taking to bury.’ (A17:1)
(16) ""ína hóla xá-qay6m°a k°íwta tàma,} málka Šlémun k°ìw6lla.} ‘They found
there an inscribed monument, which king Solomon had written.’
(A14:55)
(17) ""ítl6n xá-m6ndi b8y6x t-oð•xxe †làl6x.} ‘We have something (in mind)
which we want to do for you.’ (A4:48)
This distribution of resumptive pronominal suffixes can be interpreted
as reflecting the different syntactic status of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses. In restrictive clauses the head nominal, or at least
the relative particle D, is treated as the direct object of the verb in the
clause. Since indefinite objects in principle do not take object agreement
suffixes (§15.13.2.2.), there is no resumptive agreement suffix on the verb.
The occurrence of the pronominal suffix in non-restrictive clauses reflects
the fact that they have the status of independent clauses. Since, on the
other hand, definite direct objects in principle regularly co-occur with
pronominal agreement suffixes, this distinction in structure is not reflected
in the suffixes and the pronominal suffix occurs in both restrictive and
non-restrictive clauses.
If the referent of the head nominal is the complement of a noun in the
relative clause, it is obligatorily represented by a resumptive pronoun, e.g.
(18) ""í°wa xa-""á©a gu-Bˆrw6r,} š•mme Raš‰d-bek.} ‘There was an agha in
Barwar whose name was Rašid Bek.’ (B19:1)
(19) ""áxtu kúll5xu ‘ìdetu} l-b7°6t màlka} t-íla Gozáli ""u-Nozáli gu-b6°-dìye.} ‘You
are all invited to the house of the king, in whose house Gozali and
Nozali are staying.’ (A8:89)syntactic subordination of clauses973When the antecedent noun has the syntactic relation of an adverbial in
the relative clause that could be expressed without a preposition, there is
generally no pronominal resumption when the clause is restrictive. This
is the case with temporal adverbials (20–22) and the destination of verbs
of movement (23) (§14.13.):
(20) hál ""o-yóm6t mˆ°6n} har-""úrx6t ""álaha dóq6n b-ìði.} ‘Until the day I die,
I shall always keep to God’s way.’ (A15:21)
(21) ""7-g6t ""an-yomá°a t-awéwa ràba séra} . . . j>míwa kúlla ""ùrze,} jwànqe.} ‘On
days when there was a lot of moonlight . . . all the men and youngsters gathered together.’ (B11:3)
(22) hót m-ó-yom6 t-íx ""axni-zíle ""áti d•ry6lle gu-z6ndàna.} ‘From the day that
we went away you have held him in prison.’ (A26:76)
(23) ku-b7°a t-àzeti} ""áni t-yawìlux} là †arðílux.} ‘Every home that you go
to will give you something.’ (B7:7)
If the role of the head in the relative clause would be normally expressed
by a locative preposition in an independent clause, the preposition is
sometimes still omitted when the clause is restrictive. This is found where
the locative role would be expected to be expressed by the preposition
gu-, b- or m6n-, e.g.
(24) hátxa xazêxwale} ku-dùk°a t-awéwa.} ‘We would see him wherever he
could be.’ (B9:29)
(25) xuláßa ""aláha mut•pq6lle gu-d-a-mðíta t-íla ""5-bráta d-o-màlka.} ‘In the
end God made him come across the town where the daughter of
that king was.’ (A4:11)
(26) d6-púš làxxa} gu-d-ay-šwí°a t-wewa-dmíxa xòn6x.} ‘Stay here, in the bed
in which your brother slept.’ (A8:68)
(27) hon-d•ry6lle gu-xa-‘ále ""amúqta lá-""am6ß ‘ù-ga ‘ú-ga pal6†.} ‘I put him in
a deep pit from which he could never come out.’ (A22:41)
In some cases, however, the preposition is used in a restrictive relative
clause with a pronominal suffix resuming the head, e.g.
(28) ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux gáwa díya kúlla genàwela.} ‘(As for) the enclosure in
which you threw it, they are all robbers.’ (A15:18)
(29) m†éle gu-t8r6t ""ó-b5°a t-íla-wirta gàwe.} ‘He reached the door of the
house in which she had entered.’ (A34:11)974chapter nineteen(30) ""ána ""ap-dìya} ""áyya ""úrxa t-ín ""ána zála bíya dìya} lè-y manš•nna hál
yom6t-màw°a.} ‘I shall not give up until the day I die the way I am
following now.’ (A21:35)
If the clause is non-restrictive, a preposition with resumptive pronoun is
regularly used, e.g.
(31) ""í°wa xa-g•ppa gáwe díye ""àrbi hambišáye.} ‘There was a cave in which
there were forty giants.’ (A24:54)
A preposition is regularly used in all types of clauses if this is other than
the locative prepositions gu- or b-, e.g.
(32) d•ry5le ""an-b>†aníye xo°a-díya t-wewa-dmíxa Gozáli rèša.} ‘He placed
under her the blankets that Gozali had slept on.’ (A8:69)
A resumptive pronoun may be in a clause embedded within the relative
clause, e.g.
(33) q6m-qa†líle b-xa†oryà°a,} ""an-xá xa†oryá°a t-ínwa màr6llux} mási jùlle bíya.}
‘They killed him with washing-boards, the washing-boards which
I was telling you they used to wash clothes with.’ (B19:9)
When the head nominal has the function of locative adverbial in the relative clause, it is occasionally resumed by the adverb tama, e.g.
(34) t-lá mar>wà°5le ""o-márga} t-it-súsux d•ry6lle tàma?} ‘Is the meadow in
which you have put your horse without owners?’ (A25:60)
(35) wíð5le ""a-dúk°a nišànqa,} ""a-dúk°a t-wéwa ""o-dídwa wíra tàma.} ‘He made
a sign in that place, the place where the fly had entered.’ (A11:10)
When the head nominal of a relative clause is a predicate in a clause with a
1st or 2nd person subject and the referent of the head nominal is the subject of the relative clause, the verb of the relative clause is inflected in
the 1st or 2nd person, in agreement with the subject of the main clause,
e.g.
(36) ""ána ""o-xà qáša} t-ín ""•°ya gu-ˇiyàre.} ‘I am that priest who came to
the ˇiyare.’ (B17:15)
(37) l5t-""áti wíya xoš-náša t-it-mú°y6lla ""ánna zùze.} ‘You have not become
a good man who has brought these coins.’ (A1:26)syntactic subordination of clauses97519.2. Indirect Questions
19.2.1. Polar Question
Indirect polar questions (i.e., yes⎯no questions) are asyndetic with no
explicit syntactic marker, e.g.
(1) xáz6x máß6t t-amr•tli módin x•zya b-xêlmi.} ‘Let’s see whether you can tell
me what I saw in my dream.’ (A1:7)
(2) xàz6n} màß6n} t-óð6n xa-‘àra.} ‘I shall see whether I can find a solution.’
(A33:6)
In (3) the indirect question is negated:
(3) xáz6x lá-mß6t mam†•tla ""i°á°ux hátxa ©ðàðe?} ‘Let’s see whether you can
(literally: cannot) bring your hands together like this.’ (A28:15)
If the indirect question consists of two alternatives, these may be presented
asyndetically (4–5) or the second alternative may be introduced by the
conditional particle ""6n (6), e.g.
(4) ""o-m•ndi la-ðíle sùsa-wewa} náša-wewa l-xàße.} ‘He did not know whether that thing was a horse or whether there was a man on its back.’
(A29:21)
(5) ""áwwa táwr6t wála lán-ða""a módi ""•°ya bìye,} npíl5le b-""isàra,} ""awwa
xà-m6ndile qí°a bíye.} ‘I don’t know what has happened to that wild
ox, whether it has fallen on a rock or whether a thing such as that
has happened to him.’ (A12:52)
(6) l7la ðá""a módi bràya,} hadíya p7ša kèpa} ""•n la-p7ša kèpa.} ‘She did not know
what was happening, whether she would now turn to stone or not
turn to stone.’ (A8:73)
In (7) the conditional particle introduces a second indirect question that
is an expansion of the first rather than an alternative:
(7) l7ð6n b-x9y6n} ""6n-b-d7‰6n t-xazênn6x.} ‘I do not know whether I shall
live, whether I shall return and see you.’ (A8:56)
The alternative question may be reduced to the negative particle la (la""a).
This is introduced by lo or ""6n, resulting in the forms lo-la and ""6lla (<
""6n-la), e.g.","[1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014]"

"680chapter fifteenThe leftward movement of the copula to express focus on one argument of a clause may be used in responses to questions concerning a
particular argument, e.g.
(13) A: ""7nile ""è°ya qedàmta?} B: xònile ""è°ya qedámta.} ‘A: “Who has come
this morning?” B: “My brother has come this morning.” ’
(14) A: módit xèzya gu-bˆ°a?} B: k°àwux-in xèzya gu-b7°a.} ‘A: “What have
you seen in the house?” B: “I have seen your book in the house.” ’
Example from the text corpus:
(15) ""ánna zmaryá°a m-ˆk6t lípt6lla?} biš-basímela m->nàha.} ""ána gu-Hàlmun-in
lípt6lla.} ‘ “Where did you learn these songs from? They are more
beautiful than the others.” “I learnt them in Halmun.” ’ (A35:9)
The presuppositional background of the questions in (13) and (14) is ‘x has
come this morning’ and ‘You have seen x in the house’ respectively. The
response to such questions concerning a particular argument, however,
may also be expressed without fronting of the item in focus and leftward
movement of the copula. An alternative type of response would put the
item in focus at the end of the clause with the nuclear stress, e.g.
(16) A: ""7nile ""è°ya qedàmta?} B: ""è°y5le qedámta xòni.} ‘A: “Who has come
this morning?” B: “My brother has come this morning.” ’
(17) A: módit xèzya gu-bˆ°a?} B: xèzy5w6n gu-b7°a k°àwux.} ‘A: “What have
you seen in the house?” B: “I have seen your book in the house.” ’
This shows that narrow focus of new information alone does not necessarily bring about a construction with leftward copula movement. Rather
it is used subjectively by the speaker to communicate information that is
not only new but that he wishes to present as worthy of particular attention. It is more regularly used in contrastive constructions such as (1)–(8),
where the speaker wishes to correct a misapprehension, than in responses
to constituent questions.
It should also be noted that the leftward copula movement only occurs
when the focus is exhaustive, i.e. when the item in focus is unique for the
role in question. It is not used when the focused item constitutes one of
a list of items that perform the role, e.g.","[718, 719]"

(15–16):
(14) maníx6n ""èdl5le làxxa.} xu-mbádla q7m6n ßàl6n.} ‘I shall rest tonight here.

(A52:17)CHAPTER EIGHTEENCLAUSE SEQUENCES
18.1. Connective Particles
18.1.1. w
When functioning as a clausal conjunction, the particle w may be attached
as a clitic either to the initial or final word of a clause. It is realized as ""u- (<
*""uw) when in contact with a consonant at the beginning of a word, e.g.
(1) ""áti tú-tiwa làxxa.} ""u-súsi páy6š làxxa} ""u-""ána bráta masq•nna be-bába dìya.}
‘You stay here and my horse will stay here and I shall take the girl up
to the house of her father.’ (A29:41)
(2) ""o-yál6t b>yàwale} hóle ""ê°ya-w} q6m-yaw•lla yalêx°a ""•lli.} ‘The young man
whom she loved has come and has given me her scarf.’ (A4:24)
Occasionally, the speaker attaches a particle as a suffix to the end of one
clause and then repeats it as a prefix to the following clause, e.g.
(3) mattíla gu-qußárta mbašlìla-w} ""u-yátwi ""àxli.} ‘They put them in a pan and
cook them, then sit down to eat them.’ (A1:3)
(4) mxúll6lla pá°e dìye-w} ""u-zíl5le šúle dìye.} ‘He washed his face and went to
his work.’ (A21:16)
The particle is used to express various types of semantic connection
between clauses. In most cases such semantic connections may also be
expressed by juxtaposing clauses asyndetically without the explicit linguistic
expression of the connection in the form of the connective particle.
In narrative the particle is used to join clauses that express sequential
events. The majority of sequential clauses in narrative are joined asyndetically. The usual strategy is to use the particle before the final clause
of a chain of events. In this respect, therefore, it is a device for marking
sections of discourse that are presented as expressing closely cohering
events, e.g.","[945, 946, 947, 948]"
"838chapter seventeenWhen an adverbial interrogative expression meaning ‘why’ is placed at
the front of a copula clause, the copula is, likewise, attached to this item
rather than to the predicate, e.g.
(14) ta-módila ""áyya mðíta hàtxa?} ‘Why is this town like this?’ (A4:31)
17.1.5. Existential Usage
In a few cases the enclitic copula is used simply to predicate the existence
of a referent rather than ascribe some property to it or identify it with
another item. This is most commonly found in meteorological expressions, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)xapù°5la.} ‘It is foggy (literally: There is fog).’
mê†r5la.} ‘It is rainy (literally: There is rain).’
xêmm5le ""èlli.} ‘I am hot (literally: There is heat is to me).’
qàr°5la ""èlli.} ‘I am cold (literally: There is cold is to me).’Other examples:
(5)
(6)
(7)gu-xa-gèppa hambišàye-wawa.} ‘There were giants in a cave.’ (A12:18)
há ríx6t náša naxrày5le!} ‘Ha, there is the smell of a foreign man!’
(A24:47)
""i°á°a qàmx5le,} p°ìxt6llela t8ra.} ‘While there was flour on her hands,
she opened the door.’ (A21:26)In principle the nuclear stress is placed on the existential subject in such
constructions, which reflects its status as a new information focus. In (8)
the copula is placed on a preceding quantifier. In such constructions the
whole clause is a new information focus, including the existential subjects,
which is reflected by the position of the nuclear stress on the subject at
the end of the intonation group. The placement of the copula on the
quantifier, therefore, does not express a narrow new information focus on
the quantifier, but rather expresses a prominence or intensification of the
quantifier within the broad information focus of the clause:
(8)""Ëšwu† rába krèt-iwa gu-""á°‰a.} ráb5wa tàlga} ráb5wa mè†ra ""u-m6ndiyàne.}
‘(The month of ) February was very bad in our country. There was
a lot of snow. There was a lot of rain and so on.’ (B5:152)the clause839Sporadically the enclitic copula is found with an existential function with
referentially definite subjects in other contexts, e.g.
(9)har-W7rda-w Nˆrgis-ila.} làtla,} lá bnòne,} lá ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘Only W5rda
and N5rgis were there. They had no children, nothing.’ (A24:51)The independent copula is attested with existential meaning in clauses
contaning indefinite subjects, e.g.
(10) gu-d-ó qotíya ""íla xa-ßêpra.} ‘In that box there is a sparrow.’ (A12:40)
The deictic copula is used existentially with definite or indefinite subject
constituents. It is placed either before or after the subject, e.g.
(11) hóla ""isèq°a dìya.} ‘Here is her ring.’ (A25:69)
(12) hó""la mìya.} ‘Here is some water.’ (A28:18)
(13) xa-b7°a hòle.} ‘There is a house over there.’ (A33:5)
17.2. Clauses Containing a Negative Copula
The negative copula is in principle placed before the predicate. The most
basic construction consists of a simple nexus of copula and predicate, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)l7le dàwa.} ‘It is not gold.’ (A14:26)
l7le póìla.} ‘It is not crooked.’ (A17:20)
l7le gnàyi.} ‘Its not my fault.’ (A23:23)
l7w6t d-áwwa ""à°‰a.} ‘You are not from this country.’ (A25:82)
l7wa rába gò‰a.} ‘It was not very big.’ (B5:140)When the clause contains a subject constituent, this is generally placed
before the predicate, e.g.
(6) ""áwwa lˆle qáša.} ‘He is not a priest.’ (B17:7)
(7) ""áw l7le ""ùpri.} ‘It is not my land.’ (A25:52)
(8) Yuwán6s lˆle táma.} ‘Yuwan6s is not there.’ (A52:6)
(9) dárdi l7la d-àyya.} ‘My suffering is not from this.’ (A26:66)
(10) yèmmi l7wa qrì°a.} ‘My mother was not educated.’ (B8:15)840chapter seventeenThe nuclear stress is placed either at the end of the predicate phrase or on
the copula. It is typically placed on the copula when the predicate consists
of an item that has been introduced in the preceding discourse, e.g.
(11) mère má-l6x bráta t-it-hátxa bxàya} qam-d-ánna ""êrwe?} mèra ""ánna lˆwa
""èrwe,} xon>wà°i w7wa.} ‘He said “What is the matter with you girl
that you are weeping so much in front of these sheep?” She said
“These used not to be sheep, they used to be my brothers.” ’
(A34:20–21)
(12) mère mùt kálba mubr7°a ""áti?} . . . mèra ""áwwa lˆle kálba,} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He
said “What dog have you given birth to?” . . . She said “He is not
a dog. You are a dog.” ’ (A11:20)
(13) ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.} ""áwwa mì°5le.} ""áwwa mádam ""ì°wale} bàxta,}
""í°wale bnòne,} ""í°wale nàše,} ""áwwa lˆle mí°a.} ‘They say that he has
no relatives. He is dead (in this case). So long as he had a wife,
he had sons, he had relatives, he is not dead.’ (A17:17)
The subject constituent is sporadically placed after the predicate. As with
positive copula clauses with postposed subjects, this construction is used
to express close cohesion to what precedes. It is found in contexts such
as (14), in which the clause is a comment that is presented as a tag to the
preceding remark and not the onset of a new discourse section. Note that
the subject is in a separate intonation group:
(14) hot-q†ìl6lle ""a≥vána!} mêre} lˆle ""a≥vána} ""àwwa.} (She said) “You have killed
the caretaker.” ’. He said “He is not the caretaker.” ’ (A22:46)
The negative copula is placed after the predicate in idiomatic interrogative
constructions such as (15) and (16). In these an interrogative clause with
a negative copula echoes a preceding interogative clause with a positive
copula, maintaining the same word order:
(15) dréla šláma l-f9qih} dàx-it?} dax-lˆw6t?} ‘She greeted the jurist “How
are you? How are you not?” (A22:16)
(16) ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla.} ‘If he is my
nephew, he will come and will know what these are and what they
are not.’ (A25:49)the clause841This echoing of the word order of a preceding constituent question with
a positive copula is also found in the answer to such questions, as in (17),
in which the negative copula in the answer is placed after the predicate:
(17) ""àm6r,} Fárxo †la-xále díye ""àm6r} xáli mòdila?} xáz6x ""askaràye.} kúlla ""Amedía
píšla ""askaràye.} mère xá-m6ndi lˆla.} ‘He said, Farxo said to his maternal
uncle “What is the matter uncle? We can see soldiers. The whole of
Amedia has become soldiers.” He said “It is nothing.” ’ (A25:79)
The 3fs. form of the negative copula l5la is tagged onto the end of clauses
in various contexts to refer to some general propositional content, e.g.
(18) b8z6xwa tannêkka.} tannèkka t-nù†a l7la?} ‘We would make a hole in
the can, an oil can, is that not so?’ (B10:86)
(19) kèma gàye} gu-xáßa díya mútte tópe ‘Æruk,} lˆla.} ‘Several times the guns
were pointed at her back, bang, but it does not happen (i.e. the
gun does not shoot).’ (B9:18)
The negative particle la is occasionally used in a clause containing a positive copula in order to express asseveration rather than negation. In such
cases the negative particle never bears the nuclear stress, e.g.
(20) la-hóle mì°a.} ‘He is indeed dead.’ (A17:2)
(21) la-""aw-d°s-wewa.} ‘He was indeed right.’ (A17:8)
(22) la-málka màmi} hóle yèmya b-rèši.} ‘Indeed the king my uncle has sworn
on my head (to execute me).’ (A25:36)
(23) la-""àxxa-wewa.} ‘He was indeed here.’
Such constructions have no doubt developed from the use of the negator
as an interjection to contradict some statement or request of the interlocutor, as is seen in contexts such as (24):
(24) mère ßli-qàm°a} mère la-""àti ßli-qám°a.} ‘He said “Go down and
meet her.” He (the other) said “No, you go down to meet her.” ’
(A26:40)842chapter seventeen
17.3. The Existential ParticlesThe existential particles (""i°, ""i°wa, li°, li°wa and their variants) are placed
either before or after the nominal with which they are combined.
17.3.1. Particle—Nominal
In most constructions with the positive existential particle that are attested
in the text corpus the nominal is placed after the particle. The function
of such constructions is to introduce into the discourse new referents,
which have not been mentioned previously. The nominal in most cases is
indefinite with a specific referent, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)""í°6n xa-†ùra.} ‘There is a mountain.’ (A24:11)
""í°wa xa-màlka.} ‘There was a king.’ (A1:2)
""í° xa-párša b-réše dìye.} ‘There is a flat stone on him.’ (A39:13)
""í°6n táma ðà""a.} ‘There is a woman there.’ (A25:53)In some cases the nominal denotes a generic class or is a proper name.
Both of these types of nominal are definite in status, since their referent is identifiable from their description independently of context. The
crucial feature, however, is not identifiability but rather the fact that they
have not been mentioned previously and are being introduced into the
discourse, e.g.
(5)
(6)
(7)""í°wa ""9raq.} ‘There was arak.’ (B5:11)
""7-ga qam-lámpa ""í°wa šrà""a.} ‘At that time instead of an (electric)
lamp there was an (oil) lamp.’ (A33:1)
""7-ga ""í°6n ’ixàlo} ""u-""Ašeba†àlo.} ‘At that time there were ’ixalo and
Ašeba†alo.’ (A25:23)When the particle is negative, the nominal is placed after the particle on
several occasions, e.g.
(8) lí° ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘There is nothing.’ (A21:5)
(9) lí° ""áp-xa gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Is there nobody in the house?’ (A22:32)
(10) lí°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} ‘There are no steps for them to go down
into the basement stable.’ (A22:10)
(11) lí°wa ""ánna q>n9fe-u m6ndiyáne.} ‘There were no armchairs and things
(like that).’ (B5:200)the clause843The nuclear stress is normally placed on the phrase that follows the particle.
It is placed on the particle to express a narrow focus in contexts where the
speaker asserts the existence of something when it may be presupposed
that it does not exist, e.g.
(12) mabyóne ""ì°-xa-m6ndi gu-qèßß6t.} ‘It seems there really is something in
the story.’ (A4:18)
17.3.2. Nominal—Particle
Constructions with the positive existential particle that have the nominal
before the particle are only sporadically attested. They are used when the
nominal is modified by an interrogative particle, e.g.
(1)k6mà 'Abda-Ra˙màn ""í°?} ‘How many 'Abda-Ra˙màns are there?’
(A23:27)The nominal is placed before the particle in contexts where the referent
of the nominal has already been introduced in the immediately preceding context, e.g.
(2)†alítuwa †awalyà°a?} †awalyá°a ""í°wa ràba} ""àx‘i} lá-raba ""i-taxrênna.}
‘ “Did you play games?” “There were many games, but I do not
remember them much.” ’ (B15:30)The preposed nominal may not have been explicitly mentioned, but is
nevertheless bound to previously mentioned items in a set relation. This
is the case in (3), in which the universal set term ‘everything’ includes the
items ‘fine grapes’ and ‘houris’:
(3)""i°-táma ""ènwa †èpi} ""u-˙uriy?t} ""u-kúlla-m6ndi ""ì°gena} ‘There are there
fine grapes and houris. There is everything.’ (A2:8)Constructions with the negative existential particle that have the nominal
before the particle are frequently attested in the text corpus. On some
occasions the referent of the nominal has been mentioned in the preceding
discourse. The construction in such cases does not deny the existence of
the referent but rather denies its presence on the scene, e.g.
(4)""áza xázya jùlla,} júlla lì°.} ‘She goes to find her clothes, but her
clothes are not there.’ (A14:99)844
(5)
(6)
(7)chapter seventeen
""o-xóna zóra lì°.} ‘The young brother is not there.’ (A12:24)
Parizáda ‰ìšla,} †7ra lì°.} ‘Parizada woke up, but the bird is not there.’
(A24:30)
‰íšela ""ánna maymùne,} ""ína ""áni lì°.} ‘The monkeys woke up, but they
(the men) were not there.’ (A14:57)In some cases the referent of the nominal is linked to what precedes by
associative anaphora, such as a set relationship, e.g.
(8)xílle xá‘ca m6n-d-o-dùša.} ßéle mìya,} xa-†6ppí°a míya lì°.} ‘He ate some
of the honey. He became thirsty for water, but there was not a
drop of water.’ (A14:24)In many cases, however, the preposed nominal has no clear anaphoric
relationship with what precedes. The placement of the nominal in such
cases is likely to be conditioned by its lack of referentiality. It would appear
that referential nominals that introduce a referent into the discourse
have a greater tendency to be placed after the nominal than negated,
non-referential ones. In the attested examples the nuclear stress is placed
either on the particle (9–11) or on the nominal (12–13). The placement
of the nuclear stress on the nominal takes place where the negation of
the nominal is reinforced by the negative particle ‘u- or, in the case of
the indefinite pronoun xa, the particle ""ap. The nucelar stress gives added
force to these particles. These negative reinforcement particles may also
be used where the nuclear stress is on the existential particle (10–11):
(9)qímela xìlela.} qímela šqílela xa-""amána xàn‘i zóra.} mútt6lla k6s-réša dìya.}
ßáw°a lì°6n.} ‘They ate. Then they took a small container and put
it at her head. There was no speech (with this).’ (A21:17–18)
(10) xzéle xa-qáßra ràba gó‰a.} zíl5le mèxya t9ra.} ‘ú-naša lì°.} ‘He saw a
very large palace. He went and knocked on the door. There was
nobody.’ (A14:28)
(11) q6m-šaqlàla kanóšta,} daryála gu-nùra.} ‘ú-m6ndi lì°.} ‘She took the broom
and put it in the fire, but there was nothing (= nothing happened).’
(A12:39)
(12) ‘ù-qala lí°.} ‘There is no sound.’ (A18:15)
(13) ""àp-xa lí°.} ‘There is nobody.’ (A33:3)
When two or more negated existential clauses are conjoined, the negative
particle la may be placed before each nominal. In such constructions thethe clause845nominals are presented as being linked in a set relationship. The existential
particle may have either its positive or negative form, e.g.
(14) la-bˆ°a ""í°6n,} ""u-la-nàša ""í°6n.} ‘There is not a house and there is
nobody there.’ (A39:2)
(15) lí° là-xmara mènne díye} la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘There is no ass with him, (there
is) nothing.’ (A22:25)
The negative particle la can be used before the positive existential particle
with an asseverative function, e.g.
(16) la-""í°wa manày.} ‘Indeed there was a meaning (to this).’ (B8:33)
17.3.3. Particle Alone
In certain contexts the negative particle is used by itself, without any other
clause constituents.
It may refer anaphorically to a referent in the previous discourse denoting the absence of this referent from the scene, e.g.
(1)Óásan ""Á©a spár5le ta-t-dˆ‰a} ""u-spár5le ta-t-dˆ‰a,} lì°.} ‘Óasan A©a waits
for her to return, waits for her to return, but she is not there.’
(A27:26)Speakers sometimes use the particle as an interrogative tag to receive confirmation from the interlocutor. This is generally used in contexts where
the speaker is sure about what he is saying, but seeks confirmation as a
device for drawing attention to a particular point. The sense can often
be rendered in English by ‘you see’:
(2) ""o-šúla ""áwwa y-amrèxwale qêr†a lí°6n?} ‘We called this job trimming,
you see.’ (B5:141)
(3) mágl6t gilándi xá-mdi gò‰5le lí°6n?} ‘The scythe is something big, you
see.’ (B5:144)
(4) ""ítwa náše šuléy ""àww5le lí°6n?} ‘There were people whose job was this,
you see.’ (B5:135)
(5) ""í°wale qèšta-w géra d-ˆ-ga,} lì°?} ‘He had a bow and arrow (typical)
of that time, you see.’ (A12:32)
In narrative it is occasionally used as a device to draw attention to an
unexpected event, e.g.","[876, 877, 878, 879, 880, 881, 882, 883, 884]"
"the syntax of verbs681(18) mère yèmmi ""7nile plìxa?} mèra bábi plíx5t ""àti,} ""u-xmára-w tàwra} ""u-""ána
mtugbárt6n bˆ°a.} ‘He said “Mother, who has worked?” She said
“My dear, you have worked, (also) the ass and the ox, and I have
attended to the house.” ’ (A21:13)
Observe that in the responses of (16) and (17) the copula that occurs with
the resultative participle is an enclitic rather than a deictic copula. This
reflects a tendency to use the enclitic copula in conversational discourse
when the verbal form is in the presupposition of the clause and is not
asserted. This is typically the case in responses to constituent questions
when the verb is repeated.
The construction is sometimes used elsewhere in a more subjective
fashion, in places where the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to
an item, due to its unexpectedness or its importance in the context, e.g.
(19) b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Have you sent for me for this reason?’ (A21:35)
(20) ""abàyele dèrya b-réša.} ‘He put his cloak over her.’ (A26:50)
(21) ""àm6r} ""áwwa t>r7xu póìl5le.} báb6t bráta màra} m-ˆk5le póíla?} har-gubb?n-ix
wíð6lle.} ‘He said “This door of yours is crooked.” The father of
the girl said “How can it be crooked? We made it exactly according
to a spirit-level.” ’ (A17:20)
(22) mèra màlka t-áw6t basíma.} ""áwwa náša hàtx5le wáða.} màra} mú t-àw6ð?}
xa-dúk°6t gèld6t tàwr6n híw6lle báne b7°a.} ‘They said “King, may you
be well. That man is doing such-and-such (i.e. building the fortress
of D6md6ma).” He said “What could he do? I have given him the
space of an ox skin to build a house.” ’ (A11:15)
(23) Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} yá'ni xá°6t Mir-Zàndin-ile šqíla Qára Tè≥din.}
‘Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law, that is Qara Te≥din has married
the sister of Mir-Zandin.’ (A26:55)
(24) ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a} sab-zargùlela lwíše.} ‘The Christians were not slipping since they were wearing sheepskin shoes.’ (B19:7)
(25) xòš-zuz6x wíðe.} ‘We have made good money.’ (A14:18)
Constructions such as those in (19)–(25) are not making contrastive assertions to correct a misapprehension nor are they responses to an explicit
constituent question. The section of the clause that is not in focus is not
strictly a presupposition, i.e. it is not necessarily assumed to be a proposition that is active in the mind of the hearer. It is part of the assertion of
the clause but with a lesser degree of prominence than the focused item.
Its lack of communicative pronominence relative to the focused item is a682chapter fifteenproperty that it shares with presuppositional material. The basic function
of the leftward focus movement can, therefore, be identified as a means of
marking an enhancement of prominence on the item in question without
necessarily implying that the remainder of the clause is presuppositional.
In (19)–(22) the motivation for the construction is that the argument in
the clause is deemed by the speaker to be unexpected in the general situation described. In (23) it draws particular attention to the identity of the
person whom Qara Te≥din married, since this is the crucial point that
defines the term x6tna ‘brother-in-law’. Likewise in (24) the speaker gives
enhanced prominence to the ‘sheepskin shoes’ since these were the crucial
reason why the Christians did not slip and so were the key to their success.
In (25) prominence is given to an evaluative expression ‘good money’ in
order to enhance the degree of evaluation.
Temporal adverbial expressions may be put into focus with the construction in order to convey immediacy, e.g.
(26) bálki qam-xa-šàb°5le ""è°ya.} ‘He has come perhaps just a week ago.’
(A8:56)
The focusing of a gradable quantifier or intensifier with the leftward
copula movement conveys an enhanced degree, e.g.
(27) ""ána ràb5w6n plíxa gu-k7rma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
orchard.’
(28) ""áw hàdele bèrya.} ‘He has just been born.’
In constructions such as (27) and (28) the elements that come after the
focus are not necessarily presuppositional, but may be part of the assertion of the clause with a lesser degree of prominence than the focused
item. In such constructions with quantifiers and intensifiers the nuclear
stress is sometimes placed at the end of the intonation group rather than
on the item bearing the copula, e.g.
(29) ""ána ráb5w6n plíxa gu-kˆrma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
orchard.’
(30) yóma hádele zrìqa.} ‘The sun has just now risen.’ (A26:37)
(31) xúwwe ""áx‘ile múdwa rìqa.} ‘The snake just managed to escape.’
(A1:15)
In constructions such as (29)–(31) the material after the item bearing the
copula is part of the assertion. These examples show that the copula andthe syntax of verbs683the nuclear stress placement may operate independently in the marking
of prominence. The nuclear stress is in the default position at the end of
the intonation group and signals that the predicate as a whole is asserted
new information. The copula is used to give particular prominence to one
item in this assertion. In such constructions the copula marks a weaker
level of prominence than when it is combined with the nuclear stress. The
item with the copula is, nevertheless, given more prominence than when
there is no leftward copula movement at all, as in (32).
(32) ""ána rába plíx5w6n gu-kˆrma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
orchard.’
Conversely the nuclear stress is occasionally moved forward to give particular prominence within the intonation group without the copula moving
from its default position, e.g.
(33) xzáy6t-6lle ""áwwa qàßra?} kúlle b-qarqupyà°a bèny5le.} ‘Do you see this
palace? It is all built of skulls.’ (A24:51)
(ii) Topically Prominent Constituent
A leftward moving copula may also be attached to a topically prominent
constituent. A constituent with topical prominence has a referent that has
been mentioned in the immediately prior discourse, with the result that
it is not only assumed to be familiar to the hearer but also activated in
his consciousness. It serves as the topic of the clause. Unlike an item in
focus, the topic is not part of the assertion of the clause, rather it is the
remainder of the clause that is asserted and that conveys new information
about this topic.
Topical items with a leftward moving copula do not bear the nuclear
stress. They are, therefore, given a weaker level of prominence than focused
items that have both the copula and the nuclear stress.
Not all items that serve as a clause topic have the leftward moving
copula attached to them. This construction is restricted to topics that
the speaker wishes to give particular prominence. One context in which
the construction is attested is where the item has been activated in the
immediately preceding discourse and is repeated in consecutive clauses.
This is the case in (1) and (2), in which the second occurrence of the item
in question has a copula attached to it:
(1)""áti rába wíð6t spayù°a} ""u-""átit pqiðêll6n.} ‘You did a lot of good and
you instructed us.’ (A8:87)684chapter fifteen(2) mátti táxta hàtxa} ta-t-""àzi,} lí°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} táxt5la mútte hàtxa}
ta-ßáli tàma.} ‘They placed a board like this, so that they could go
(there)—there are no steps—so that they can go down to the basement. They placed a board like this, so that they could go down
there.’ (A22:10)
These constituents are anaphorically bound to the immediately preceding discourse and function as the informational starting point, i.e. topic,
of the ensuing propositions. These can be regarded as two aspects of a
broader notion of topic as a current item of concern in the discourse. The
constituents would have this status even if they did not have the copula
enclitic. The copula gives added coding, which enhances the prominence
of this status. This ‘heavy’ coding of the clause initial topic is often used
as a strategy to signal a boundary in the discourse. The purpose of signalling the boundary may be to mark the clause off distinctly from what
precedes in order to give prominence to the content of the clause, which
appears to be the motivation in (1) and (2). In (3) the strategy of boundary marking is used to mark a clear opposition between the actions of
the subject referents in two adjacent clauses:
(3) mbàdla,} qyàm5la,} kúlla b8yi t-àzi,} ""áww5le dmìxa Barzèkko.} ‘In the
morning they got up and all wanted to go, but he, Barz6kko, was
asleep.’ (A12:8)
The construction may also be used to give topical prominence to the
anaphoric element hatxa ‘thus’, which refers back to a situation in the
preceding discourse. In (4) the purpose is to set the two clauses apart and
present them as expressing separate events:
(4) hátx6n wíða be-xàli,} hátx6n wíða be-""àmti} ‘I did such-and-such in the
house of my uncle, I did such-and-such in the house of my aunt.’
(A23:40)
(iii) Other cases of leftward movement
It is necessary to distinguish some other categories of construction which
exhibit leftward movement of the copula enclitic. These include interrogative constituents, adverbials and certain subordinating particles.
(a) Interrogative constituents
The copula element of the resultative is generally attached to interrogative constituents. In some cases the interrogative constituent bearsthe syntax of verbs685the nuclear stress and it can be classified as the expression of a type of
narrow focus. The remainder of the clause is presuppositional and the
focus is put on the interrogative item. Unlike assertive clauses, however,
the identity of the interrogative item is not being asserted but rather
questioned. Examples:
(1)
(2)
(3)

and how have you come?’ (A14:33)
dàx-it xíla kúlla?!} ‘How have you eaten all of it?!’ (A2:11)Such constructions are analogous to interrogative clauses such as (7) and
(8) in which the question concerns one constituent:
(7)
(8)""àtit q†íl6lle xúwwe?} ‘Was it you who killed the snake?’ (A24:45)
""àtit mú°y6lle †7ri?} ‘Was it you who brought back my bird?’ (A24:32)In many cases, however, the nuclear stress is placed on the final word of
the intonation group rather than on the interrogative constituent, e.g.
(9) ""7nile plìxa?} ‘Who has worked?’ (A21:13)
(10) ""7nile q†ìl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A15:16)

(15) †la-módit ""è°ya dmìxa} gu-šwì°i?} ‘Why have you come to sleep in my

(16) ""u-lé-y-y>ð6n m-7k6t ""ê°ya.} ‘And I do not know from where you have
come.’ (A14:76)
(17) y8ð6t ""7k6n dêry6lle?} ‘Do you know where I have put him?’ (A22:44)
Such constructions, in which the nuclear stress is not on the interrogative
constituent, have a different information structure, in that the question686chapter fifteenis not focused exclusively on the interrogative constituent but rather on
the proposition as a whole. The attachment of the copula enclitic to the
interrogative constituent, therefore, cannot be motivated by its being in
narrow focus. The interrogative constituent, nevertheless, is what the
question primarily requests information about and so is given prominence
by the copula, but this is a weaker level of relative prominence than
constructions in which the constituent is marked both by the copula and
by the nuclear stress.
(b) Adverbials
Narrow focus is sometimes given to an anaphoric adverbial by attaching the copula to it and giving it the nuclear stress. As in some of the
examples of narrow focus on nominals cited above, the remainder of the
clause is not always necessarily a presupposition. The purpose of giving
the adverbial a high degree of prominence is to enhance its anaphoric
function and bind it closely with what precedes, e.g.
(1) mutt7°6lle púmma gu-pùmm6t} Fàrxo,} šuréla myàßa} ""ˆ-dan5la kèlye.} ‘She
put her mouth on the mouth of Farxo and began sucking. At that
time they stopped (crying).’ (A25:5)
(2) †alána yá'ni †alàna,} sab-šèmša ""7-g6t maxyàwa} †uráne ""àtx5na wíye.} ‘(The
word) †alana means “shady”, since when the sun rose, the mountains
became like that (i.e. became shady).’ (B3:2)
(3) bábi muttúle táma bˆ°a.} zìll5ni,} t6xrú°a dìyi} ""u-t-xóni d-o-gò‰a.} ""áwwa
xóni tàm5le bèrya.} ‘My father set up home there. We went, as far as
I remember, together with my older brother. This brother of mine
was born there’. (B8:10)
In (4) this device of enhancing the force of the anaphoric binding of the
adverbial is used in a clause that has the status of a relative clause. The
effect is to bind the clause clearly to the preceding head noun:
(4) ""5-dúk°6t m>m6ðìwal6n,} ""ax-xa-bányo zòra,} ""átxa gu-""úpra nqìra,} kúll6n
tàm5w6x m5mèðe t-íw6x bèrye}—""áw6n pìš5wa.} ‘The place in which they
used to baptize us, like a small bath, dug into the earth, where all
of us who were born were baptized—that has survived.’ (B3:20)
An adverbial that does not bear the nuclear stress may have the copula
attached to it, as in (5), where the copula is moved leftwards onto the tem-the syntax of verbs687poral adverbial in the clause ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme}. This may be regarded as
a type of topical prominence, which is a weaker level of prominence than
the prominence expressed by both the copula and the nuclear stress. The
effect, as is generally the case with clauses with initial topically prominent
items, is to signal a boundary in the discourse. Although the initial item
is anaphorically bound to what precedes, its status as a communicative
starting point is enhanced. This is the case here, in which the clause in
question offers a piece of incidental information about the general historical situation, which is not directly connected to the event of the wedding
discussed in what precedes. This should be contrasted with the function
of the construction occurring earlier in the passage ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni
Šèmmo}, in which the adverbial is given a stronger degree of prominence by
both copula movement (in this case a past copula) and by nuclear stress.
The speaker intends this clause to be bound closely with what precedes,
since it relates directly to the wedding.
(5) taxránne †la-xlúl6t xóni Šêmmo} ""7-g6 t-w7wa ríqe nàše} ßèlye Bad5rêške,}
""áskar t-léwi síqta gu-""Ón-Nùne,} ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni Šèmmo.} ""6ngl6znàye}
""áskar-t léwi tàxr6n.} ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme,} gu-Tùrki músqe.} ‘I remember
the wedding of my brother Š6mmo, when people had fled and
come down to Bad5r6ške. The Levy army went up to ""“n-Nune. It
was then that Š6mmo married. I remember the English, the Levy
army. At that time the borders were moved, they were moved up
to Turkey.’ (B9:21)
A similar strategy is exhibited by (6)–(8). Here the adverbs with an enclitic
copula but without the nuclear stress are linked correlatively to the following clause rather than being bound to what precedes. In (6) the following clause specifies the content of the adverb. Examples (7) and (8)
are adversative constructions. The initial adverbials set up an expectation
that is reversed in the second clause:
(6) bróni hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye.} ‘My son, the situation is like this. The king has brought his daughter.’ (A21:8)
(7) zíl5le †8ya bràtux.} hád6x-ile wìða,} bás lˆle xèzy6lla.} ‘He went to look
for your daughter. He acted thus, but did not find her.’
(8) k6má-gay6x tíwe m-©ðàðe,} har-lán mêßya ""axwá°e dìye.} ‘However many
times we have sat together, I still cannot be like him.’ (A25:44)688chapter fifteen(c) Subordinating Conjunctions
In subordinate clauses opening with the general subordinating conjuction
D or the conditional particle ""6n the copula is attached to the conjunction
at the front of the clause.
The subordinating conjunction D may serve as the head of a relative
clause (1–3) or the subordinative operator of other types of clause, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)mqawòl5w6n,} ""ap-""an-zúze kúlla t-in šqìl6lla} p>lènna pàlge.} ‘I promise,
I’ll divide into halves also all the money that I took.’ (A1:17)
la-b8y6n ""áyya bráta t-in-mú°y6lla t-y8ða qá-t †líba díya hóle mì°a.} ‘I do
not want this girl whom I have brought to know that her betrothed
has died.’ (A4:33)
t-lá mar>wà°5le ""o-márga} t-it-súsux dèry6lle tàma?} ‘Is the meadow in
which you have put your horse without owners?’ (A25:60)
""áx-t-it-""áti šêtya,} ""áp-""aw hàd6x.} ‘As you have drunk, he also (has
been treated) in the same way.’ (A26:33)
dáx t-in-mu°7°6lla ""a-béna xèta,} ""ay-béna ""àna ma°yánna.} ‘Just as I
brought her before, so this time I shall bring her.’ (A27:30)
""ím6 t-íla mú°y6lla ""a-bráta ""èlle dìye,} mbùrx6lla.} ‘When they brought
that girl to him, they wedded her (to him).’ (A16:6)
xá-xeta qímela zìlela,} ha-t-íla zíle óêmy5le.} ‘They went (to help) once
again, but by the time they had gone, it was put out.’ (A48:4)
l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
(A17:2)On many occasions the copula bears the nuclear stress of the intonation
group, e.g.
""u-dí‰5le ßèly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na,} ""5-""7na t-ìle ""è°ya qamáye réša.} ‘He went
back down to the spring, the spring to which he had come previously.’ (A26:32)
(10) ""ó-yòm t-ìle plí†a} bróne díye mì°5le.} ‘The day that he went out, his
son died.’ (A4:32)
(11) ""ánna dax-t-ìla zíle,} M8mo dèry6lle gu-z6ndàna.} ‘When they had gone,
they put M>mo in jail.’ (A26:74)
(12) ""ax-t-ìle wíra,} ""í°wa dúk°a ta-t-kalèwa.} ‘When he entered, there was
space for him to stand.’ (A22:30)
(9)The placement of the copula on the subordinate particle in relative clauses
can be related to the use of leftward copula movement to mark topicallythe syntax of verbs689prominent items. The referent represented by the D particle, which is that
of the antecedent noun in the adjacent main clause, is clearly the main
topical concern of the relative clause. Although such copula movement
to mark topical prominence is an optional strategy in main clauses, it has
been formalized as a fixed rule in subordinate relative clauses. It would
appear that this was further generalized to other types of subordinate
clause opening with the particle D.
Examples of leftward movement of the copula in protasis clauses opening with ""6n:
(13) ""èn-in ""àna ""è°ya gu-šwí°6x,} qr7g6n xaddàm6x.} ‘If I have come to sleep
in you bed, call your servants.’ (A26:4)
(14) ""6n-it ""è°ya šúl6t qa˙bù°a,} k6s-báb6n B9ku.} ‘If you have come to fornicate, then (lodge) with our father B>ku.’ (A26:26)
The movement of the copula onto the conditional particle ""6n is likely to
have arisen from the fact that the particle was originally followed by D,
as is still the case in some NENA dialects.
15.4.1.4.2. Rightward Movement of the Enclitic
The default position for the nuclear stress of an intonation group is on
the last item in the group. When the nuclear stress occurs in this position,
therefore, it does not necessarily express ‘narrow focus’ on this one item
but frequently expresses a ‘broad focus’ which includes the whole predicate
of the clause.9 The copula element may be shifted rightwards onto this
word with nuclear stress at the end of the intonation group. This is done,
however, only when the nuclear stress is expressing broad focus. The purpose of the construction, therefore, is not to express narrow information
focus on the word, with the remainder of the clause presupposed. Rather,
the clitic gives the item in question an enhanced prominence within the
broad focus of the predicate, due to its importance or unexpectedness. In
example (1) a group of men are transformed into sheep, which is presented
as a surprising and pivotal development by the placement of the copula
on the nouns at the end of the intonation groups. In (2) the rightward
shift of the copula highlights the royal clothes, by which the king’s son
identifies himself, and this is an important turning point in the narrative.","[719, 720, 721, 722, 723, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728]"
"the syntax of verbs661and nothing of the event of his coming is to be seen. The form °ele would
be used if any phase of the event of coming can be seen directly by the
speaker, even if this is only the static endpoint of his standing at the door.
One says dìya °éle} ‘He has come just now’ referring explicitly to the fact
that the endpoint of the event coincides with the present moment, but the
expression *diya hole ""6°ya would not be felicitous. The resultative form is
disconnected from the event also referentially in that it does not make any
direct reference to the specific event that caused the result in question.
The result expressed by the resultative form may be an actual perceptible
situation or an experiential property of the subject referent, e.g.
(1) hón xíla gêrðo.} ‘I have eaten stew.’
(2) xílli gêrðo.} ‘I have eaten the stew.’
Example (1) may be interpreted as asserting that at the present moment
there is a perceptible result of my having eaten stew at some unspecified
time in the past, e.g. I had a large stew for lunch and cannot eat much
dinner. This construction could also be interpreted as asserting that I have
the permanent property of being in the state of having eaten stew, i.e.
it has been part of my life experience. In this interpretation it denotes
that on some occasion, possibly on more than one occasion, I have eaten
stew, though not necessarily recently. The purpose of the deictic copula
in both interpretations would be to draw attention to the relevance of the
past event to the present moment in time. In both cases there is a degree
of indeterminateness concerning the event. The verbal form implies the
existence of at least one unspecified member of the set of past events of
eating. In the first interpretation the implication from the discourse context
in which it is used (e.g. in response to the question ‘Why do you not want
to eat your dinner?’) is that there was only one unspecified event. In the
experiential interpretation the possibility remains open that there were
more than one. In example (2) the q†ille form, by contrast, refers to the
occurrence of one specific event that occurred at a specific point in time
in the recent past. In such a construction the noun g6rðo would, therefore,
normally be definite with a specific identifiable referent.
The context may force a definite interpretation of an object nominal
of a resultative construction, e.g.
(3) A: ""7k5le gêrðo?} B: hón xíl6lle gêrðo.} ‘A: “Where is the stew?” B: “I
have eaten the stew.” ’662
(4)chapter fifteen
A: ""7k5le gêrðo?} B: xílli gêrðo.} ‘A: “Where is the stew?” B: “I have
eaten the stew.” ’The difference between these is as follows. The resultative construction in
(3) asserts a present state that is disconnected temporally from the event that
caused it, so the event must have happened at some time in the past that
is not adjacent to the present moment, e.g. several hours ago or yesterday.
The q†ille form would be used as in (4) when the endpoint of the past event
is adjacent to the present, i.e. I have just now eaten it, where a translation
with the English perfect of recent past would be appropriate.
The indeterminateness of the event signified by the resultative form
means that the individual referents of plural nouns or nouns of mass in
the clause can be interpreted as being distributed over more than one
event during a particular duration of time, e.g.
(5)
(6)
(7)""èdyo hón xíla rába xabùše.} ‘Today I have eaten many apples.’
""èdyo hóla ""è°ye rába nàše.} ‘Today many people have come.’
""èdyo hón xíla lêxma.} ‘Today I have eaten bread.’Example (5), with a plural patient argument ‘apples’, can be interpreted as
meaning that during the course of today up to the present moment there
have been various occasions on which I have eaten apples. The consumption of ‘many apples’ may have been distributed over various events, with
a few apples being eaten on each occasion. It could also be interpreted
as denoting the result of a single event of apple eating. Likewise example
(6), which has a plural subject argument, can be interpreted as meaning
either that the ‘many people’ came separately in a series of discrete events
or that they arrived together. The construction reports only that ‘many
people’ are in the resultant state of ‘having come’, without denoting that
this was the result of one or of a series of events. The interpretation of
(7), which has a noun of mass ‘bread’ as an object argument, could be
that I have eaten some bread on various occasions today or on only one
occasion. Contrast this with the equivalent clauses with q†ille forms:
(8) ""èdyo xílli rába xabùše.} ‘Today I ate many apples.’
(9) ""èdyo °éla rába nàše.} ‘Today many people came.’
(10) ""èdyo xílli lêxma.} ‘Today I ate bread.’
The q†ille form denotes a specific event and (8)–(10) must be interpreted
as referring to single events. The adverbial ""6dyo ‘today’ would normallythe syntax of verbs663force the interpretation that the endpoint of these events occurred before
the present moment and so they must be translated with the English
preterite.
In some circumstances the context indicates the specific event that
caused the present result. If, for example, the clause contains a punctual
time adverbial binding the event to a particular point in time with no
duration, the event is fully specified. Clauses containing the resultative
form combined with such time adverbials, therefore, assert the existence
of a present state and the context signals that it has been caused by this
specific event. These would still differ from corresponding clauses with the
q†ille form, which assert the occurrence of the event but the existence of a
present state is only a possible implicature, which may be cancelled. Note
that in English the present perfect is not used when the clause contains
such time adverbials, e.g.
(11) xóni hóle ""è°ya ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""èóóa-w pàlge.} ‘My brother came today at
half past nine.’
(12) xóni °éle ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""èóóa-w pàlge.} ‘My brother came today at half
past nine.’
The construction (11) with the resultative form asserts that my brother is
currently in the state of ‘having come’ and so would be the natural construction to use if he is still here. Construction (12) could be interpreted
as implying that he is still here, but this implicature could be cancelled
and the form would still be felicitous (13). Any corresponding denial of
the existence of the present result with the resultative construction would
not be felicitous (14), e.g.
(13) xóni °éle ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""êóóa,} bás plí†le bá°6r pàlg6t-sa""6t.} ‘My brother
came today at nine o’clock, but left after half an hour.’
(14) ?? xóni hóle ""è°ya ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""êóóa,} bás hóle plí†a bá°6r pàlg6t-sa""6t.} ‘My
brother came today at nine o’clock, but left after half an hour.’
The functional features of the resultative that have been described above
are also discernible in its negated form l5le q†ila. The negative form l5le
""6°ya ‘He has not come’ can be analysed as meaning that he is currently
not in a state of ‘having come’. Thus no specific event is negated. The
implication is that no event of coming has occurred at any time. The
negative la q†ille form, on the other hand, negates the occurrence of a specific event in the recent past. The event has its specificity and definiteness664chapter fifteenby being bound to a particular point in time in the discourse context.
Consider (15):
(15) lat-nxàpa!?} xá ""axwá°i mìra} dráya šlámi ""êllux} ""u-""áti tíwa l-†ìzux!} lèmo
la-qìmlux?} ‘Are you not ashamed!? A prince like me greets you and
you sit on your bum. Why did you not get up?’ (A26:48)
Here the question with the negated q†ille form la-qìmlux is intended to
ask why the addressee did not get up specifically at the time that the
speaker greeted him. The translation of such negated q†ille forms by the
English perfect of recent past is appropriate in a context where an event
was expected to occur and the endpoint of its occurrence was expected
to be adjacent with the present. If somebody is expected to arrive at a
house at a particular time, somebody in the house may say °èle? ‘Has he
come?’ The response to this could be là °éle ‘He has not come’, which
would deny that he has come at this expected specific point in time in
the recent past, with no necessary implication that he will come in the
future. After uttering this, it would be appropriate to assert an action that
is sequential to this specific point in time, e.g. là °éle.} ""àz6x.} ‘He has not
come. Let’s go’. The negated q†ille form là-°ela in (16) from the text corpus
should be interpreted in this way:
(16) xéna ""ána q7m6n ""áz6n ""ùmra,} ""ánna xon>wá°a là-°ela.} ‘Well, I shall
go to church. These brothers have not come back (now when I
expected them to come).’ (A37:2)
Note also (17), in which the absence of expectation that the man will
come in the future is made explicit:
(17) xóni zílle ""u-lá °èle.} ""u-díya ""ána hon-xšáwa leš-""à°e.} ‘My brother has
gone and has not come back, and now I think he will no longer
come back.’ (A8:60)
The negated q†ille form can be combined with the temporal adverbial particles referring to the present moment, such as heš ‘still’ and hal-diya ‘until
now’. These underscore that the action that is negated was expected to
happen at a point in the immediate past adjacent to the present moment,
e.g. heš-là °éle,} ""àz6x!; hal-díya là °éle,} ""àz6x!} These could be paraphrased:
We have waited for him until the present moment, when he was expected
to come, but he has not come at the expected time, so now let’s go.","[699, 700, 701, 702, 703]"

1025PREFACE
The complete destruction of the villages of Barwar in northern Iraq in
1988 brought to an end the world of an Assyrian Christian community
that spoke a dialect of neo-Aramaic. The dispersal of the villagers to the
Iraqi towns and to a diaspora outside Iraq has considerably threatened
the survival of their dialect. Many of its distinctive morphological features
and numerous items of vocabulary relating to the traditional agricultural
life of the community are in danger of being lost. Also endangered is the
rich tradition of oral folklore that existed in the community in former
times but, for the most part, is now falling into oblivion.
Over the last five years I have worked with informants who grew up and
lived in the villages. In this book I attempt to capture the world of their
community as they knew it in former times. It has been my privilege to
have met some of the oldest surviving members of this community who
still remember well their neo-Aramaic dialect and the oral folkloric traditions. On the basis of the material gathered from numerous fieldtrips, I
present here a detailed linguistic description of their dialect, an extensive
corpus of transcribed recordings and a glossary of lexical items.
I should like to express thanks to all my informants without whose
kind collaboration this work could never have been undertaken. These
include Yuw6l Yu˙anna, Nan6s B6nyam6n, B6nyam6n B6nyam6n, Bibe

Barwari, who helped me with my initial questionnaire of the morphology
and subsequently answered many other questions. Thanks are due also
to Fabrizio Pennacchietti for arranging the meeting with the informant
J6bray6l Gw6rg6s Bakko. I have a particular debt of gratitude to Mišay6l
Bar‘6m and Rev. Dr. Xoš>ba Georges, both of whom offered me many
hours of their time and warm hospitality in their home. I should also like
to register my thanks to my students, interaction with whom at our neoAramaic seminars was a great stimulus to me in my research.","[35, 36]"
"the clause829(13) xa-kàrm5le} rába gò‰a.} ‘It is an orchard (which is) very large.’
(A12:9)
When the adjective occurs in the same intonation group as the head noun,
the copula is placed at the end of the phrase, e.g.
(14) ""ána xa-náša gò‰5w6n.} ‘I am an old man.’ (A8:43)
(15) ""áy q6ßßètta rìxt5la.} ‘It is a long story.’ (A25:52)
(16) xa-qèßß6t rába mapš6mànt5la.} ‘It is a very sad story.’ (A4:31)
On some sporadic occasions the copula is placed on a quantifier or intensifier particle that stands before the head of the predicate, e.g.
(17) ráb5wa náše xêðye.} ‘The people were very happy.’ (B15:12)
(18) ráb6xwa xèðye pßìxe.} ‘We were very happy and cheerful.’ (B16:6)
(19) t8r6t ""ùmra} ráb5wa kòpa.} ‘The door of the church was very low.’
(B15:2)
(20) kúlla qumašàt ""7-ga bíš-w5wa rešàye.} ‘All the material at that time was
of the very best quality.’ (B10:45)
This retraction of the copula can be regarded as a device for expressing the prominence of the intensifier particle. The predicate as a whole
expresses new information, so the particle is not being singled out as the
only information focus in the clause. This is reflected also in the prosody,
in that the nuclear stress is placed at the end of the predicate, which is
intended to mark the whole phrase as new information. Rather, within
the new information of the predicate, the intensifier is being given an
enhanced prominence. This can be compared to a construction with a
compound verbal form such as (21), in which the copula is moved back
onto the quantifier raba to give it an enhanced prominence within the
new information of the predicate:
(21) zríy6nwale b-i°à°i} ""u-ráb6nwa k‘íxa bíye dìye.} ‘I had cultivated it with
my hands and greatly toiled in it.’ (A17:32)
When the subject constituent is postposed, in some isolated cases it is placed
after the head noun of the predicate but before a dependent modifier.
This applies to (22), in which the independent subject pronoun intervenes
between a noun and its adjective. As with other cases of postposed subjects,
the clause has a status of a comment on what precedes it:830chapter seventeen(22) káze xoš-ßlìg6n} yalúnka ""áti zòr5w6t.} ‘He tried (to persuade him to go)
“Go down, you are a young child.” ’ (A29:28)
17.1.2. Independent Copula
17.1.2.1. Basic Predicate
An independent standing copula without a subject constituent is attested
in the text corpus in two contexts.

These tend to occur as answers to rhetorical questions such as (1) and (2):
(1)
(2)""5-màsta} ""i-d5ríla gu-gùða.} gúða mòdile?} ""íle gèld6t xa-hèw6n.} ‘They put
the yoghurt in a churn. What is a churn? It is an animal skin.’
(B6:38)
x7la díya mòdile} t-mazvêrra?} ""íla mìya.} ‘What is its power, which turns
it? It is water.’ (B6:53)This type of question and answer structure has a similar function to
clauses with an independent copula after the subject such as guða ""ile g6ld6t
heyw6n, x5la diya ""ila miya (§17.1.2.2.), which typically supply an explanatory
or elaboratory comment on what precedes.
(ii) Past Copula after the Predicate
These constructions do not appear to be significantly different in function
from corresponding ones with an enclitic copula. The ‘heavier’ coding
brought about by the prosodic separation may have been exploited by the
speaker to give the clause added prominence, e.g.
(1)
(2)gu-bˆ°a wéwa.} ‘He was in the house.’ (A6:1)
rába tàza ""iyéwa.} ‘It was very good.’ (B5:55)17.1.2.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
Clauses containing an independent standing copula generally have a
subject constituent in the form of an independent pronoun or a nominal.
The constructions discussed in §17.1.2.1. which lack a subject constituent
are far more rarely attested in the text corpus. The subject constituent is
regularly placed at the front of the clause before the predicate. The copula
is placed either before the predicate, immediately after the subject (1–6),the clause831or is placed after the predicate (7–10). This applies both to the present
and the past copula.
(1)
(2)
(3)""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl.’ (A29:63)
""áxni ""íw6x màlke.} ‘We are kings.’ (A18:8)
""áxxa ""í°ena dàwla.} dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.}
‘Here there is a drum. The drum is a box, with an open top, in
which they put wheat.’ (B6:54)
(4) b7°6t Qára Té≥din qìdle.} Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} ‘The house of
Qara Te≥din has burnt down. Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law.’
(A26:55)
(5) m6lxáwa ""íwa mtúrßa m-qˆsa.} ‘The winnowing fork was made from
wood.’ (B5:87)
(6) w-áw ""iwéwa malàxa.} ‘He was an angel.’ (A8:25)
(7) ""ána Qára Tè≥din ""íw6n.} ‘I am Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:68)
(8) ""ána brònux ""íw6n.} ‘I am your son.’ (A18:7)
(9) sab-qyámta b-lˆle ""iyáwa.} ‘because Easter was at night.’ (B5:53)
(10) tròßa} ""áni milàne ""iy7wa} ‘In fact, they were green.’ (B5:218)
The placement of the copula immediately after the subject in clauses such
as (1)–(6) expresses the topical prominence of the subject. This reinforced
coding of the topic in initial position functions as a discourse boundary
marker. The construction is used either in statements that supply explanatory information concerning what precedes or in statements that open
a section of discourse. When acting as explanatory comments on what
precedes, they differ from constructions with postposed subjects such as
(§17.1.1.2., examples 18–24) in their degree of independence and prominence. The postposed subject constructions are incidental comments that
are tagged onto what precedes. The constructions with the initial subject
and following copula are presented as important pieces of information,
which typically have relevance for what follows as well as being explanatory of what precedes.
As remarked, the position of the copula after the subject expresses the
topical prominence of the subject. The prosodic detachment of the copula
as an independent word can be interpreted as a ‘heavy’ grammatical coding
device intended to give the clause as a whole prominence and distinctness.
Construction such as (7)–(10) which have have a prosodically independent
copula after the predicate exhibit this latter device. They can, therefore, be
regarded as expressing some degree of prominence. Indeed, they can all
be interpreted as being intended as important statements in the contexts832chapter seventeenin which they occur. They lack the additional device of reinforcing the
topical prominence of the subject as a means of marking their distinctness. It should be noted, however, that in the attested examples of this
construction a pronominal subject is always expressed by an independent
pronoun (cf. 7, 8, 10) rather than zero anaphora. This in itself is a ‘heavy’
coding device designed to mark a boundary (see §17.7.4.).
The subject constituent in clauses with an independent copula is not
postposed after the predicate. This can be explained by the fact that, as
seen in §17.1.1.2, the postposition of a topic subject constituent, is typically used as a device to bind cohesively the clause with what precedes
as a form of incidental tag. This is incompatible with the function of the
independent copula as a marker of distinctness and independence from
what precedes. An apparent exception to this is (11):
(11) r6š-kúlla d-áni ""íla S6ttìye.} ‘Above all of these is S6ttiye.’ (A25:22)
Here the inflection of the copula agrees with the noun S6ttiye and in this
respect the latter would normally be construed as the grammatical subject.
In terms of information structure, however, the initial prepositional phrase
containing the anaphoric pronoun is clearly more topical than the noun
S6ttiye, which is the asserted focus of new information.
The initial subject constituent is sometimes separated from the rest of
the clause by an intonation group boundary. This is a further prosodic
device to reinforce the prominence of the initial topic in order to give the
clause as a whole distinctness in the discourse and disjoin it from what
precedes, e.g.
(12) ""u-zeðàya} ""íla biš-xlìmta.} ‘A flat-bread is thicker.’ (B6:49)
(13) Nìnwe} ""iwáwa pét6xt ""a°oràye.} ‘Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrians.’ (B6:17)
(14) M9mo} ""íwewa gu-""Al?n} ""u-Zìne} ""iwáwa gu-Jazíre Bòta.} ‘M>mo was in
""Alàn and Zine was in Jazire Bota.’ (A26:1)
17.1.3. Deictic Copula
17.1.3.1. Basic Predicate
When the deictic copula occurs in a clause without a subject constituent,
it is normally placed before the predicate (1–3).","[867, 868, 869, 870, 871]"
"836chapter seventeenIt is wheat, sesame, millet, barley, everything put in leather bags.’
(A23:17)
(2) ""í°wal6n mandòrta.} mandórta mòdila?} ""áwwa kèp5le,} m6n-gòte,} m-ay-góta
m-ay-gòta} xrí†a xa-bòya.} ‘We had a roller. What is a roller? It is a
stone, bored with a hole in its side, on one side and the other side.’
(B5:145)
(3) ""éða gò‰a} yóm6t trùšeba} y-áwe duxràna.} y-áwe duxràna.} ""o-duxrána mòdile?}
""an-nàše} kùlla báte} kut-b7°a mbáš6l xa-mêndi.} ‘During the “big festival,”
Monday was a (time of ) memorial, it was a (time of ) memorial.
What is this memorial? The people, all the families, each family
cooks something.’ (B5:64)
The referent of the subject has not always been mentioned in the preceding
discourse. In (4), for example, the subject ‘his job’ has not been mentioned.
The crucial factor is that the narrator presents the interrogative clause as
a boundary, introducing a section of discourse in which he describes the
activities of his daily work:
(4) ""í°wale xa-tàwra} ""u-xa-xmàra.} kút-yum šúle díye mòdi-wewa?} šaqêlwale
táwre díye} ""u-šaqêlwa xmáre díye} qèdamta} y-azèlwa z>rèwa} ""u-y-a°éwa
l-bˆ°a,} y-axèlwa mèndi ""i-damêxwa.} ‘He had an ox and an ass. Everyday what was his job? He would take his ox and take his ass early
in the morning and go to cultivate (his field). He would then come
back home, eat something and go to sleep.’ (A21:3–4)
The construction with the subject before the predicate is sometimes used
at the beginning of a speech turn, e.g.
(5) ""ám6r ""áw ""ˆnile?} ‘He says “Who is he?” ’ (A22:29)
(6) ""ám6r ""áti ""ˆniw6t?} ‘He says “Who are you?” ’ (A28:34)
When the subject is placed after the predicate, the nuclear stress is either
placed on the predicate or on the subject. As remarked above, the subject is postposed in various contexts where the clause is presented by the
speaker as cohesive with what precedes. In (7) and (8) the construction is
used in the second of a series of two questions, the purpose of which is
to elicit the same basic information and are presented as a unit:
(7) yába ""ˆk5le} Dáw6ð kòra?} ""7k5le ma˙álle dìye?} ‘Where is blind David?
Where is his place?’ (A16:3)the clause
(8)837mère †la-Zàlo:} Zàlo} ""ánna mòdila gu-réšux,} ""ánna šaqyà°a?} módila ""ánna
brinàne?} ‘He said to Zàl “Zàl, what these on your head, these scars?
What are these wounds?” ’ (A29:4)In (9) the question ‘What was her name?’ is presented as cohering closely
with the preceding clauses which introduce the referent of a woman into
the discourse:
(9)""í°wa xa-baxtà} rába xàm°5wawa.} módi-wewa šèmma dìya?} B6lbèl Hazàr.}
‘There was a woman. She was very beautiful. What was her name?
B6lb6l Hazar.’ (A8:21)In (10) the subject is postposed in a question at the beginning of a speech
turn. The effect of this is to present it as a tag to what precedes, eliciting
a supplementary detail, rather than setting it up as the onset of a new
section of discourse concerning ‘your house’:
(10) b-óma xéna ""á°eti †la-kawù°ra,} ‘íd6t k6slˆni.} mère ""ˆk5le b5°7xu?} mèra
fèll6n dùk°a.} ‘(She said) “The day after tomorrow come to lunch,
you are invited to our home.” He said “Where is your house?”
She said “In such-and-such a place.’’ ’ (A22:14)
If the interrogative constituent is the subject of the clause, this is normally
placed at the front of the clause with the copula cliticized to it, e.g.
(11) ""7nile gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Who is in the house?’
(12) ""7nile zaqàra?} ‘Who is a weaver?’
(13) módile r6š-mèz?} ‘What is on the table?’
The nuclear stress is in principle put on the predicate. The placement of
the copula on the subject can be explained as a reflection of the topical
prominence of this constituent. It is not topically prominent in the sense
that it is referentially bound to the preceding discourse, but rather due
to the fact that it is the central concern of the clause which is typically
expected to be talked about in the following discourse. This may be termed
‘forward pointing’ topical prominence (see §15.4.1.4.1. iiia).
The nuclear stress is generally placed on the interrogative subject
constituent when the predicate is a component of the presuppositional
background the clause. The prosodic pattern ""ˆnile gu-b7°a}, for example,
would typically be used when the speaker assumes that the hearer is
entertaining the presupposition that somebody is in the house.","[874, 875, 876]"

In the light of the foregoing, it is easiest to regard the q†il5le preterite as a
narrative verbal form, characteristic of fictitious discourse, which originally
developed in imitation of the use of the Turkish evidential verbal forms
with -mi{ in fictitious narrative. It did not, however, come to be used as a
fully functional evidential form that could be used outside of narrative.
15.4.1.4. Movement of the Enclitic Copula
As remarked, positive assertive resultative constructions can have the
enclitic or the deictic copula. If special prominence is given to a particular constituent of the clause, however, only the enclitic copula is used. In
such circumstances this is moved from the participle and attached to the
prominent constituent in question. In most cases the constituent that is
given prominence in this way is placed before the participle, whatever its
grammatical function in the clause, and so the movement of the enclitic
is leftwards. In some constructions in narrative the enclitic moves rightwards and is attached to a constituent that occurs after the participle in
the clause.
15.4.1.4.1. Leftward Movement of the Enclitic
In constructions where the enclitic copula is moved leftwards it is important
to distinguish cases where the constituent that is given prominence bears
the nuclear stress and cases where the nuclear stress is placed elsewhere
in the clause. As a general rule, prominent items bearing the nuclear
stress are clausal arguments expressing some kind of information focus,
by which the speaker wishes to draw the hearer’s attention to important
new information. This may be termed ‘narrow’ focus, in that attention is
drawn to one particular argument in the clause and not to the predicate
or overall proposition as a whole. The normal default position for the678chapter fifteennuclear stress is at the end of the intonation group. Since the focused item
is placed at the beginning of the clause the nuclear stress is in a marked
position. Items given prominence that do not bear the nuclear stress, on
the other hand, are generally not a focus of new information.
(i) Narrow New Information Focus
One type of narrow new information focus that is expressed by the attachment of the enclitic copula is contrastive focus. This is used when the
speaker wishes to correct a misunderstanding by strongly asserting that
one particular item should be selected for the role in question rather than
the one currently entertained by the hearer, e.g.
(1) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} brònux-ile xíla xabúša.} ‘A: “Your brother
has eaten an apple.” B: “No, your son has eaten an apple.” ’
(2) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} xàwx5le xíla xóni.} l7le xabùša xíla.} ‘A:
“Your brother has eaten an apple.” B: “No, my brother has eaten
a peach. He has not eaten an apple.’ ”
(3) A: xóni hóle xèzya brat7xu qedàmta} B: l7le qedàmta xèzya brát6n,} têmm6l-ile
xèzy6lla.} ‘A: “My brother saw your daughter this morning.” B: “He
did not see our daughter this morning, he saw her yesterday.” ’
Examples from the text corpus:
(4) l7w6n °í°a b-xabr6 dìye.} ""áyya xá°e dìyela.} b-xábr6t xá°6 dìy6n °í°a.} ‘I did
not come at his word. She is his sister. I came at the word of his
sister.’ (A8:85)
(5) ""àn6n mú°y6lle.} ‘I (and not my brother) have brought it back.’
(A24:31)
(6) yába ""àn6n mšúdr6lla!} ‘I (not God) have sent them!’ (A6:4)
(7) ""àn6n xèzy6lle,} dìyile.} ‘I (and nobody else) have found it. It is mine.’
(A14:15)
(8) ""ànna} Sêttiyela mutt7°6lla láxxa.} ‘S6ttiye (not anybody else) put these
here.’ (A25:36)
In principle when the speaker expresses a narrow focus on one particular
argument of the clause, the proposition of the clause is presupposed to
be known to the hearer and activated in his mind with the exception of
the identity of the argument in question. In (1), for example, the clause
brònux-ile xíla xabúša} is used by the speaker when he presupposes that the
hearer knows that somebody has eaten an apple, i.e. the presuppositionalthe syntax of verbs679background is ‘x has eaten an apple’. What the speaker is asserting, i.e. the
new information that he is conveying, is that x is to be identified as ‘your
son’.8 In many languages this type of argument focus can be expressed
by a cleft sentence, e.g. ‘It is your son who has eaten an apple’, in which
the assertion of the identity of the argument in focus is expressed by an
identificatory predicate and the presupposition is placed in a subordinate
relative clause. The constructions with copula movement such as brònuxile xíla xabúša} are not cleft sentences since the presupposition is not in a
relative clause and, moreover, the copula agrees with the subject, even if
this is the asserted argument, e.g. ""àn6n mú°y6lle} ‘I have brought it’ (= It
was me who has brought it). The attachment of the copula to the focused
argument and the placement of the nuclear stress on this argument are,
nevertheless, properties of the predicate of a copula clause. It may be
said, therefore, that the construction possesses some properties of a cleft
sentence but does not have all the components of its structure.
Clauses exhibiting leftward movement of the copula may have two foci
of contrast, in which case the subject is given preference for the attachment of the enclitic, e.g.

sleep in my bed.’ (A26:4)The presuppositional background of these constructions would have two
unknown variables, e.g. ‘x came to y’ and the speaker is asserting the
identity of both of these.
The intention of the new information focus may be to express exclusivity, e.g.
(11) har-""àtit plíxa} ‘Only you have worked.’ (A21:15)
(12) kúlla hóla q†ìle.} bas-àn6n šrí†a.} ‘They have all been killed. Only I

worked’ and ‘x has escaped’ respectively.","[715, 716, 717, 718]"
"546chapter fourteen14.9.10. xakma
This particle has been formed by the combination of xa with k6ma. It is
used in the sense of ‘a small quantity of ’ or ‘some (items/portion of a
set)’: xákma m6ndiyàne} ‘some things’ (B5:62), xákma xabráne ‘some words’
(A4:40), xákma šènne xène} ‘a few more years’ (B5:208), xàkma dukáne} ‘some
places’ (B6:2). In some cases it is used with a singular noun of mass: bá°6r
xákma dàna} ‘after some time’ (B165),
(1) hálli xákma mêndi} masqánne l-bˆ°a.} ‘Give me some stuff to take up
to the house.’ (A22:19)
It may be used pronominally, independently of a head noun. In such cases
it normally denotes groups of items that belong to a set, e.g.
(2) xákma doqíwale xúwwa qa†lìwale.} xákma z>dìwa.} ‘Some took hold of
the snake and killed it. Some used to be afraid.’ (B5:78)
(3) xákma la-ßˆmi.} xákma ß7mi †ŀá yomàne.} ‘Some do not fast. Some fast
for three days.’ (B6:21)
(4) xákma dwáqa xáße dìye} ""u-xákma darqúle dìye.} ‘Some (villagers) supported
him and others were against him.’ (A7:20)
(5) náše mšuréla xnàqa,} xàkma náše,} ""u-xákma mxulßàla gána.} ""u-xákma síqla

‘People began to drown—some people, some saved themselves.
Some went up onto the roofs of houses. Some went up onto high
places so that the water would not reach them.’ (B6:18)
Occasionally the particle has the form xamka by metathesis, e.g.
(6) yáp6xwale xámka yomàne.} ‘We would bake for a few days.’ (B10:91)
(7) xámka bênya} ""u-xámka là.} ‘Some built (such houses), some did not.’

14.9.11. xena ( f. xeta, pl. xene)
Sporadically this word is attested in the form xrena (f. xreta, pl. xrene), in
which the original /r/ has been preserved.
14.9.11.1. Modifier of a Noun
When functioning as a modifier of a noun, the word is always placed after
the noun. A singular indefinite noun in such phrases generally has thethe syntax of nominals547indefinite cardinal particle xa/ða ‘a, one’ and definite nouns singular and
plural have demonstratives. The word means ‘other’, both in the sense
of ‘different, alternative’ and also that of ‘additional’:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)mattúli xá-š6mma xèna.} ‘Give me another name.’ (A7:2)
m-ya-góta xèta} ‘from the other side’ (A25:30)
""áwwa plí†5le gu-ða-dúnye xèta.} ‘He came out in another world.’
(A14:26)
w-an-xon>wá°a xéne mèra ‘the other brothers said . . .’ (A12:17)
ða-kista-xéta max-d-áy yawênn6x.} ‘I shall give you another bag like
that one.’ (A4:16)
xa-béna xéta mjarbênna.} ‘I shall test them another time (= again).’
(A48:4)The particle ‘u- may replace xa/ða before negated indefinite nouns:
(7)‘ú-mdi xéna lì°6n.} ‘There is nothing else.’ (A4:43)An indefinite singular noun does not have any preceding particle if it is
a noun of mass: tálga xèna} ‘more snow’, mèndi xéna kúlla ‘all else’ (A21:14).
Elsewhere an indefinite singular noun rarely lacks the preceding particle.
The attested examples are listing constructions, expressing one of several
items in a list rather than one that is in binary opposition to another item
(8) or adverbial phrases (9), e.g.
(8)
(9)qímle ""áqla xéta . . . q6m-parêmla.} ‘He cut off another leg (one of the
four).’ (A22:5)
zílle ""u-xyèle gu-mðíta xéta.} ‘He went and lived in another town.’
(A18:11)The head of the phrase may be an interrogative pronoun: módi xèna?}
‘What else?’ (A23:35), ""7ni xèna?} ‘Who else?’
Indefinite plural nouns may have the indefinite determiner xakma ‘some,
a few’ or a numeral: xákma šènne xène} ‘a few more years’ (B5:208), trè-m6ndiyane xéne} ‘two other things’ (A39:8), ""6ßrà †iyáre xéne} ‘ten other people from
iyare’ (B17:16), ""6ští-š6nne xène} ‘sixty more years’ (A4:48). It is, however,
often left without any determiner:
(10) ""o-táj6r núbl5le náše xène.} ‘The merchant brought other people.’
(A14:72)548chapter fourteenAn adjective is placed after the particle if the adjective is presented as
specific to the item in question:
(11) xzéli xa-b7°a xéna zòra.} ‘I saw another house, (which was) small.’
(12) xàr°a} t-á°e xá-""eða xréna zòra.} ‘Then comes another festival, (which
is) small’ (B6:8)
If the adjective expresses a property that is common to the set of which
the noun in question is one member, the particle xena is placed after the
adjective:
(13) xzéli xa-b7°a zóra xèna.} ‘I saw another small house (another one of
the set of small houses).’
The noun may be omitted with the singular indefinite particle xa/ða or a
demonstrative alone functioning as the head of the phrase: xa-xéna ‘another
one’ (A23:27), ða-xéta ‘another one’ (A22:9), ""o-xéna ‘the other one’ (A4:45),
""áyya xéta ‘this other one’ (B12:2), ""an-xéne ‘the others’ (A8:86). The singular
indefinite particle is occasionally omitted in contexts where the item is
presented as one of a list of members of a set:
(14) qayèmwa xéna t-amêrwa} ‘Another man (from the group) would get
up and say . . .’ (B5:9)
(15) ""áy y-oya-prìqta,} mátta xéta šópa dìya.} ‘(When) that is finished, she
puts in another in its place.’ (B5:102).
It can act as the modifier of an interrogative pronoun in constructions
such as ""u-mòdi-xen6t xèzya?} ‘What else have you seen?’ (A17:8).
14.9.11.2. Adverbial
The particle xena may be used adverbially with the sense of ‘more,
again’:
(1)
(2)
(3)""ána xéna šúla la-pàlx6n.} ‘I shall not work any more.’ (A23:40)
xéna ‰ìš5le.} ‘He woke up again.’ (A14:95)
xéna téla tèl5le.} ‘The fox was a fox again.’ (A32:26)When it occurs at the front of a clause, it is often largely devoid of semantic
content, serving, it seems, as a discourse particle expressing some kind of
boundary and prominence, e.g.","[584, 585, 586, 587]"

3.1. Phonetic Realization and Transcription
The physical duration of a consonant that is marked as geminate in the
transcription varies considerably. As a general rule the duration of a geminate consonant that is preceded by a stress is longer than one that lacks a
preceding stress. This can be seen by comparing the range of durations
of /ll/ in the following examples, in which the approximate duration of
the geminate consonant is measured in milliseconds:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)máx6lla [}mæ[x6l](70)æ] ©ðàðe} ‘He knocks them together’ (A24:13)
z•dy6lla [}zıdy6l](80)æ] tàma} ‘They threw down it there’ (A24:25)
mùrr5-lli} [}mÛr[5[l[(115)i] ‘Tell them to me’ (A24:11)
zílle [}zil](75)e] ‘He went’ (A24:4)
kúlle [}kÛl[(130)e] ‘all of it’ (A24:11)
šqúlle [}∫qÛl[(155)e] ‘Take it!’ (A24:15)
g•lla} [}gıl[(190)æ[] ‘grass’ (A24:15)In words with the same stress position a geminate consonant is still realized with a wide range of durations, as can be seen in (8)–(12), which
illustrate various attested durations for the geminate consonant /xx/ in
the word laxxa ‘here’:
(8) láxxa [}læx(50)æ] (A24:51)
(9) láxxa [}læx](80)æ] (A24:4)
(10) làxxa} [}læx[(95)æ] (A24:6)
(11) làxxa} [}læx[(125)æ] (A24:6)
(12) làxxa} [}læx[(185)a] (A24:49)
As can be seen, there is a considerable difference in the duration with
which the sequence /xx/ is realized in this word. It tends to be longer at
the end of an intonation group, though even here there is a large variety
of realizations. The duration is reduced in forms that occur inside an
intonation group. Indeed this lower range of durations, as attested in (8)96chapter threeand (9), overlaps with the durations attested for instances of the same
consonant that are represented in the transcription as non-geminate, as
can be seen in (13)–(17) below. In some cases, in fact, a non-geminate /x/
in these examples has a longer phonetic duration than geminate /xx/ in
examples (8)–(12):
(13) xa-da‰mána [x(60)æ-d)6‰}mæ[næ] ‘a remedy’ (A24:2)
(14) ""an-tre-xéne [}x(70)e[ne]] ‘the other two’ (A24:5)
(15) xa-šùla} [x(75)æ-∫u[læ[] ‘a job’ (A24:4)
(16) xa-màlka} [x(80)æ-}mælkæ[] ‘a king’ (A24:1)
(17) ""ixàla} [""i[}x(90)æ[læ[] ‘food’ (A24:16)
The transcription of gemination that is adopted in this grammar does
not attempt to reflect the phonetic diversity of individual occurrences of
words that has just been described. The general principle that has been
followed is that a geminate consonant is consistently marked in a particular
lexical item or inflectional form, even where, on the phonetic level, the
duration of the consonant is reduced in some utterances of it. The choice
as to which words gemination should be marked in is based on relative
rather than absolute phonetic duration. In general, all other factors being
equal, certain lexical items or inflectional forms exhibit a more consistent
tendency for a consonant to be pronounced long than others and it is
in such cases that the consonants are marked as geminate. Consonants
that are marked as geminate would be expected to be pronounced long
consistently when the word occurs in pausal position at the end of an
intonation group, though the precise duration of this length may vary.
Of course, the term ‘gemination’ or ‘doubling’ strictly refers only to the
double marking of the letter in the orthography. As seen above in the
instrumental measurements, there is no question of exact doubling in
phonetic duration.
The marking of consonant gemination in certain words in the transcription is further justified by the existence of a number of minimal pairs in
which two words are distinguished only by the length of a consonant. The
absolute duration of the consonants in each member of the pair may be
increased or reduced according to the contextual position of the word,
but, all other factors being equal, there is clearly a relative difference in
length that has significance for meaning and for the morphological pattern to which the words are assigned:consonant gemination

pharyngal consonants.
3.3. The Origin of Consonant Gemination
3.3.1. Gemination Inherited from Earlier Aramaic
Gemination inherited from morphological patterns of earlier Aramaic is
preserved in various words. This is the case when the geminate consonant
is preceded by the short vowel /6/ in a stressed syllable, e.g.
l•bba
q•nna
""•zza‘heart’
‘nest’
‘nanny-goat’In some words it is preserved after /6/ also in unstressed syllables, e.g.
d6bbóra
s6mmála‘hornet’
‘bundle’cf. Syr. debbòrtà
cf. Syr. semmàlàIn other words, however, it is normally weakened in this context, e.g.
gezara
lišana‘carrot’
‘tongue’cf. Syr. gezzàrà
cf. Syr. leššànàThe distribution of gemination in these patterns, therefore, has become
largely lexicalized.
The original gemination has usually been weakened after an original
/a/ or /u/ in both stressed and unstressed syllables, e.g.
káka
xabúša
basíma
mšadóre
gúda
buqára
mšul•xle‘tooth’
‘apple’
‘pleasant’
‘to send’
‘wall’
‘question’
‘he stripped’< *kakkà
< *˙abbùšà
< *bassìmà
< *mšaddòrè
< *guddà
< *buqqàrà
< *mšulláx-lèhconsonant gemination99There are some exceptions to this principle. The consonant /r/, for
example, tends to preserve vestiges of gemination in contexts where it is
lost in other consonants. This is the case, for example, in some nominal
patterns with an originally geminated medial radical, such as *CaCCùCà,
*CaCCùCtà and *CaCCàCtà, in which /r/ is often heard geminate, though
in free variation with non-geminate forms. The gemination is regularly
lost, by contrast, in other consonants, e.g.
garruwa ~ garuwa
garruta ~ garuta
parrušta ~ parušta
qarraßta ~ qaraßta
†arraša ~ †araša‘pile of twigs’
‘small pile of twigs’
‘smooth pebble’
‘crowbar’
‘bush’Contrast:
xabuša
tanura
šabuqta
nasarta‘apple’
‘oven’
‘wooden rod’
‘saw’< *˙abbùšà
< *tannùrà
< *šabbùqtà
< *nassàrtàIt should also be noted that words with an original geminate *r in the
historical pattern *CaCCà have emphatic /‰/, which is pronounced with
a longer trill than non-emphatic /r/, e.g.
ma‰a
pa‰a‘spade’
‘lamb’< *marra
< *parràGemination of other consonants is occasionally heard after /a/ in words
deriving from the historical patterns *CaCCàCà and CaCCìCà, e.g.
gabbara
†annaxa
bannaya
qaddiša‘hero’
‘miller’
‘builder’
‘saint’In some cases these may have been influenced by literary Syriac or by
loans from Arabic with the same pattern that preserve the gemination,
e.g. ˙addada ‘blacksmith’, fassada ‘corrupt person’. In the words of Aramaic100chapter threestock, however, the forms with gemination are generally used in free variation with forms that lack it, e.g. bannaya ~ banaya ‘builder’.
Gemination occurs after /u/ in the word pumma ‘mouth’. Here the
explanation seems to be that the /u/ has developed from an original *6
under the influence of the following labial.
Gemination is preserved after /a/ in the word xašša ‘sadness’ < *˙aššà
and its derivative xaššana ‘sad’ and also in the word šmayya ‘heaven’. This
may be due to the association of these words with the language of the
liturgy and so could be explained as due to the influence of literary
Syriac.
Note also the preservation of the geminated /m/ in the numeral xamm6š
‘five’ (f.) < *˙amm6š.
3.3.2. Gemination after Stressed Short Vowels
Gemination has developed in a number of cases after a stressed syllable
containing a short vowel that has become open due to the elision of a
consonant at the beginning of the next syllable. In some words where the
vowel in question is /6/ or /u/ the gemination regularly occurs, e.g.
d•mme
Ñ•qqa
q•††a
xúwwe‘tears’
‘split’
‘piece’
‘snake’< *d•me < *d6m'è
< *p•qa < *p6q'à
< *q•†a < *q6†'à
< *x5we < *xuwyàIn words contaning the low vowel /a/, such secondary gemination does
not occur regularly and in most words is in free variation with forms
without it, e.g.
t8ra ~ tárra
m8ra ~ márra‘doors’
‘illness’< *tar'à
< *mar'àThe gemination is stable, however, after an /a/ vowel in the numeral
‘seven’:
šáwwa‘seven’< *š>wa < *ša∫'àWe may include here perhaps the demonstrative pronouns ""áwwa ‘this’ (m.)
and ""áyya ‘this’ (f.) and the adverbial támma ‘here’, in which gemination isconsonant gemination101a stable feature. It may have developed secondarily by a similar process
due to the elision of a laryngal:
‘this’ (m.)
‘this’ (f.)
‘here’""áwwa
""áyya
támma< *"">wa < *""awhà
< *"">ya < *""ayhà
< *t>ma < *támhàAnother exceptional form is the word ""axxa ‘here’ < *""àxà and its variant
láxxa ‘here’ < *l-àxà, in which the gemination appears to have developed
on account of the incidence of stress in the preceding syllable, despite
the fact that the vowel was originally long.
3.3.3. Gemination in the Environment of Epenthetic Vowels
A similar type of secondary gemination has developed after a stressed
short epenthetic /6/ in nouns and particles, where it is a fixed feature of
the word, e.g.
d•mma
š•mma
†•¬¬6°‘blood’
‘name’
‘three’ (f.)< *d•ma
< *š•ma
< *†•¬6°< *dmà
< *šmà
< *†¬à°Such gemination is also heard after stressed epenthetics in some verbal
forms, though it is not stable and occurs in free variation with forms
without the gemination, e.g.
m>l•pa ~ m>l•ppa
mz>w•gi ~ mz>w•ggi
mury•za ~ mury•zza‘she teaches’
‘they pair together’
‘standing in a row’A geminated consonant after an unstressed /6/ syllable in some nominal
patterns may have developed secondarily after the insertion of an epenthetic either before it or after it, e.g.
d6qq•n°a
š6dd•lta
x6mm•rta
l6xxáwa‘chin’
‘lullaby’
‘bead’
‘bridle’< *d6q6n°a < *d6qn°a < m. d6qna
< *š6d6lta < *š6dlta < pl. š6dle
< *x6m6rta < *x6mrta < pl. x6mre
< *l•8àwà < *l8àmà102chapter threeThe gemination in the word ""•mma ‘hundred’ may have developed due to
stress falling on a prosthetic vowel: ""•mma < *má (cf. Syr. mà). It is more
likely, however, that it developed originally in compound forms such as
xamšá-mma ‘five hundred’ due to the incidence of stress on the last syllable of the first numeral. After the development of gemination in such
compounds, the word for ‘hundred’ was reanalysed as ""6mma.
3.3.4. Gemination Resulting from Elision
Gemination has developed in some words due to the elision of a vowel
between two syllables with the same consonant at their onset, e.g.
qúppe
mássa‘brooding hen’
‘ox goad’cf. Syr. quppàªà
cf. Syr. massàsà, C. Qaraqosh masasa3.3.5. Gemination in Kurdish Loanwords
Kurdish loanwords that end in a consonant after a short vowel often
have their final consonant geminated after the addition of an Aramaic
inflectional vowel, e.g.
šákka
pálle
g6rs•kka
kaw•lla‘male sheep (2–3 years old)’
‘embers of wood’
‘wild pear’
‘ruin’< Kurd. {ek
< Kurd. pel
< Kurd. girsik
< Kurd. kavilIn Kurdish loanwords /r/ is regularly geminated by this process when it
is a reflex of the Kurdish trilled ‰, e.g.
karra
šarre
garra
parra
kav6rra‘deaf ’
‘war’
‘pool’
‘feather’
‘young male sheep’< Kurd. ke‰
< Kurd. še‰
< Kurd. ge‰
< Kurd. pe‰
< Kurd. kavi‰It does not always take place, however, when it is a reflex of the nontrilled Kurdish r, e.g.
g6ra‘hill’< Kurd. girconsonant gemination1033.3.6. Gemination Resulting from Assimilation
Gemination has sometimes resulted from the assimilation of consonants
in affixes. This occurs, for example, when the /l/ of pronominal suffixes
is assimilated in certain contexts. This gemination takes place irrespective
of the quality of the preceding vowel, e.g.
qa†l•nne
qa†lánne
twínne
mšad•rre
xírre‘I (m.) kill him’
‘I (f.) kill him’
‘He went numb’
‘He sends it’
‘He looked’< *qa†l6n + le
< *qa†lan + le
< *twin + le
< *mšad6r + le
< *xir +leGemination that resulted as a result of assimilations within the interior
of words at an earlier historical period has now mostly been weakened,
e.g.
mðita
šeta‘town’
‘year’< *mðìttà
< *šattà< *mðìntà
< *šantàCHAPTER FOURSYLLABLE STRUCTURE

with /""/ in its coda. These are intensive variants of forms with /a/ in an
open syllable: "">wáha (ms.), "">yáha (fs.) ‘that over there’, t>máha ‘over there’,
la! ‘no!’. As has been remarked in §2.5.2., the secondary development of a
laryngal must be reconstructed as occurring in other words of the language
at some earlier historical period, e.g. “eta < *“a""ta < *“attà ‘year’.
Similarly the occurrence of the laryngal /h/ is largely restricted to the
onset of the syllables CV and CVC. It does, however, occasionally occur
as the second consonant of the syllable onset cluster CC-, e.g.
/h/ha.diya
har.nuwa
mha.y6r‘now’
‘rabbit’
‘he helps’In a few forms metathesis has taken place that removes the /h/ from the
coda of a syllable and thus preserves it from elision, e.g.","[130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"

(38) ""u-""áti d6-ráqð6t š5šátla gàn6x.} ‘You should dance and shake yourself.’
(A27:11)
It may be used in deontic questions such as (39), in which the speaker
addresses the hearer expecting him to impose an obligation or give permission:
(39) de-maxêxle?} ‘Should we beat him?’ (A14:8)
It is placed before the negative particle la in negated deontic expressions,
e.g.
(40) ""áti d6-la-dàmxeti!} ‘Do not sleep!’ (A29:19)
(41) ""ám6r ham-ma-yxàl6f,} 'Abda-Ra˙màn d6-la-""àr6q.} ‘He said “That’s all
right, (only) don’t let 'Abda-Ra˙màn get away.” ’ (A23:30)
(42) ""álaha d6-là-""aw6ð!} ‘God forfend!’ (A27:37)
The particle may be combined with xoš, e.g.
(43) d6-xoš-gàwra.} ‘Let her marry.’ (A26:79)
(iii) šut
As with the other particles, this occurs in both positive and negative
deontic expressions, e.g.
(44) ""6n-maßya šut-""oðala. ‘If she can, let her do it.’ (C1:11)
(45) šút la-""à°e!} ‘Let him not come!’
15.1.1.6. Predictive Future (Irrealis)
The qa†6l is used to predict a future event. In class A verbs that are not
negated this is restricted to predictions that the speaker is not completely
certain about and that he is not guaranteeing will be fulfilled. This can
be designated as a modal future, e.g.
(1)
(2)bálki ""à°ya.} ‘Perhaps she will come.’ (A8:49)
bálki ""á°e xa-yóma ""5-bráta kˆrba mènni.} ‘Perhaps a day will come
when that girl will be angry with me.’ (A14:98)578
(3)
(4)chapter fifteen
""àp-t6mm6l ""áxl6x mènna.} ‘We may (perhaps) eat them also tomorrow.’
(A2:2)
qa-mò ""óð6t ""atxa-šùla?} ‘Why would you do this thing?’ (A8:17)The form is perfective, since it presents actions delimited with a start
and end point or at least with a start point. The form may also express
iterative aspect. In this context the form can still be interpreted as perfective, in that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express each
individual perfective occurrence of the iterated situation, e.g.
(5)bálki ""á°e kùt-yum} ‘Perhaps he will come everyday.’Non-modal future verbs, by which the speaker asserts that something will
take place and is committed to the truth of this assertion, are expressed
by the b6d-qa†6l form with the prefixed future particle (cf. §15.1.5.). When
negated, however, the qa†6l form in group A verbs is used to express both
the modal predictive future, where the action is uncertain (6–7), and also
the non-modal future, which predict events that the speaker is certain will
take place (8–10), e.g.
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)bálki lá-""awð6n xàbrux.} ‘Perhaps I shall not do as you say.’ (A21:43)
dàx la-y>ðènne?} ‘How could I not know?’ (A14:90)
""áti xúwwe là ""axèll6x.} ‘The snake will not eat you.’ (A24:39)
málla t-axèlla ""aw-lá-""ax6l ‘ú-mdi sab-rùt5la.} ‘The mullah will eat it
and he will eat nothing because it is Friday.’ (A2:4)
(10) qázi t-awèdla †làlux,} lá-""aw6dla †làli.} ‘The judge will make a decision
in your favour, he will not make it in my favour.’ (A6:8)
In class B verbs the qa†6l form is used to express the modal and non-modal
future in both positive and negated clauses, e.g.
(11) qa†lênnux.} ‘I shall kill you.’ (A15:4)
(12) ""àna ma°yánne.} ‘I shall bring her back.’ (A27:30)
(13) bálki qàrm6n.} ‘Perhaps I shall win.’ (A1:4)
(14) brát6t màlka} pál†a l-gàre.} ‘The daughter of the king will come out
onto the roof.’ (A27:11)
(15) ""aw-máy6° ""u-""ùpra páy6š bíyi.} ‘He will die and his land will remain
for me.’ (A26:25)
(16) ""o-Mar-Mùše} x5làn5le,} maxèl5xu.} ‘Saint Muše is strong. He will strike
you.’ (B18:7)the syntax of verbs579When expressing the future, the qa†6l form may have its deictic centre in
the past, as is the case with (17) where it occurs in the context of a past
narrative:
(17) hád6x m-bar-t-gwìrra,} ""aláha q6m-yawèlla xa-bròna.} ""ìma?} ""7-šet6t mˆ°i.}
""7-šet6t m7°i q6m-yawèlla xa-bróna zòra.} ‘So, after they married, God
gave them a son. When? The year they would die. The year they
would die, He gave them a small son.’ (A4:57)
15.1.1.7. Conditional Constructions (Irrealis)
The qa†6l form is used in the protasis of conditional sentences referring
to present or future time, e.g.
(1)(2)
(3)
(4)""6n-""ána ""amrènnux módile xèzya málka b-xêlme,} ""ánna ""álpa dáwe p>lêtla,}
pálga †làli} pálga †làlux?} ‘If I tell you what the king saw in his dream,
will you divide those thousand gold pieces, half for me and half
for you?’ (A1:6)
bas-""èn ""á°ya xá-baxta nabláli qa-kut-t-b9ya,} y6n-qa-xóna dìya,} ""ána btazàna.} ‘But, if a woman comes to take me to anyone she wants,
or to her brother, I shall go.’ (A8:78)
""6n-lá-""oð6t b-xábr6t ""alàha,} b-talqèti.} ‘If you do not do the word of
God, you will be obliterated.’ (A8:97)
""6n-lá-""az6n mšàyð6n.} ‘If I do not go, he will go mad.’ (A4:27)The qa†6l form occurs in the apodosis when there is a degree of uncertainty
concerning the occurrence of the situation. This is attested in contexts
where two possible alternative situations are referred to, e.g.
(5)
(6)""6n-íle mì°a,} g8r6g mˆ°6n.} ""u-""6n-""à°e} ""á°y6n mênne.} ‘If he is dead, I
must die. If he comes back, I shall come back with him.’ (A8:61)
""6n-""óð6t xàbri,} ""òð6t.} ""6n-lá ""òð6t,} kli°à-llux-ila.} ‘If you do as I say, you
will do so (so be it). If you do not do so, it is up to you.’ (A8:44)15.1.1.8. Irrealis Complement Clauses
The qa†6l form occurs in subordinate clauses that are complements of
various verbs and expressions when the action of the verb in the subordinate clause is as yet unrealized. It is used after verbs expressing desire
and permission (e.g. by ‘to want’, šwq, qbl ‘to permit’), and also in complements of various other verbs and predications where the action is as yet
unrealized relative to the main clause. The qa†6l form in the subordinate580chapter fifteenclause expresses perfective aspect, in that it presents the action as an event
with start and endpoint or at least one that is delimited by a start point
future to the present moment. It may also be used to denote an iterative
activity. In this function it is still perfective, since the speaker uses the
form that is appropriate to express each individual perfective occurrence
of the iterated situation.
The verb of such subordinate clauses is sometimes introduced by the
subordinating particle D. This particle is, however, often omitted. Its omission is particularly common after the verb by ‘to want’, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)""áp-""ana b8y6n ""àz6n.} ‘I also want to go.’ (A1:5)
b8y6n ""amrênn6x.} ‘I want to tell you.’ (A4:41)
b8ye ""á°e xazèlux.} ‘He wants to come and see you.’ (A4:24)
""ána b8y6n mênn6x} ""àwwa xóni} ""oðátle xá-ga xéta m>d6‰ètle nèšma dìye.} ‘I
want you to make my brother (alive) again and return his breath
to him.’ (A8:80)
b8y6x xá-m6ndi gu-t9ra qablítula.} ‘We want you to pledge her something on the doorstep.’ (B10:36)On some occasions, the particle occurs before the verb of the complement clause, e.g.
(6)
(7)b8y6n t-àz6n.} ‘I want to go.’ (A8:65)
b8y6n ""álaha t-yawèlli mèndi zàwda.} ‘I want God to give me something
more.’ (A3:1)Examples with other verbs:
(8)""áp-xa la-qábl6t t-áw6r gu-bˆ°a.} ‘You should not allow anybody to
come into the house.’ (A23:25)
(9) d6-šúql6n dàmx6x.} ‘Allow us to us sleep.’ (A15:8)
(10) ""u-hálle ßàle,} šám6† qðále dìye.} ‘Let him go down (the mountain) and
break his neck.’ (A15:13)
(11) l7le ßbára t-áw6r xà.} ‘Nobody dares enter.’ (A32:32)
(12) ""o-t-l7le plíxa là sáp6r t-áx6l.} ‘Whoever has not worked should not
expect to eat.’ (A21:15)
The negative particle la is sometimes used in clauses that are the complement of the verb zd"" ‘to fear’, reflecting a negative deontic dimension to
the situation, e.g.","[615, 616, 617, 618, 619]"
"For the use of ma in conjoining constructions see §14.11.
14.9.14. ""5ni
This may be used as an interrogative modifier of a noun in the sense of
‘which’, e.g.
(1)
(2)""7ni báxt5la mubrˆ°a?} ‘Which woman has given birth?’ (A25:6)
ga-l7ð6x ""5kˆla,} b-7ni dùk°5la.} ‘But we do not know where she is, in

(3)551ga-""7ni Zìne} ""áxni lˆð6x.} ‘Now, which Zine we do not know.’
(A26:61)It may be separated from its head by intervening material, in which case
it is linked to the noun by the annexation particle D, e.g.
(4)""7ni ""ítl5xu t-náše t-máßi mšáw°i mênna.} ‘What people do you have
who can talk with her?’ (A4:13)In (5) the particle is placed after the noun and is followed by a prepositional
phrase that restricts the scope of the question to a previously mentioned
known set of items:
(5)pènxa ""7ni m6nnˆle?} ‘Which of the (types of) grind wheel is it? (literally: a grind wheel which of them is it?)’ (B5:92)It is more frequently encountered in the text corpus as an independent
interrogative with the sense of ‘who’, e.g.
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)""ˆnile?} ‘Who is he?’ (A2:7)
""ˆni híwle-ll6x?} ‘Who gave it to you?’ (A4:19)
""7nile q†ìl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A15:16)
""7ni b-záw6n tàwra?} ‘Who will buy an ox?’ (A22:2)This usage no doubt developed from questions concerning members of
a set such as:
(10) ""7ni m6nn7xu t-àz6l?} ‘Which of you will go?’ (A30:1)
(11) múr ""ˆni-m6nn6n} biš-šapìrt5la.} ‘Say which of us is the most beautiful.’
(A25:17)
14.9.15. hatxa
This word may be used as an anaphoric determiner before a singular or
plural noun in the sense of ‘such a’, ‘such’, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)bróni lá-wuð hátxa mêndi.} ‘My son, do not do such a thing.’ (A14:6)
lì° hatxa-mèndi.} ‘There is not such a thing.’ (A25:69)

(6)
(7)
(8)hátxa la-hàwya.} ‘Such a thing should not be.’ (A21:32)
si-hátxa múrg6n †la-màlka.} ‘Go, say thus to the king.’ (A17:30)
qa-mòt hátxa wáða bíyi?} ‘Why are you doing this to me?’ (A25:42)It can take a nominal plural ending, e.g.
(9)""ána g8r6g ""ámr6n hatxàne.} ‘I must tell such things.’ (A39:7)It is used predicatively, e.g.
(10) hàtx5la qèßß6t.} ‘The story is this.’ (A13:5)
(11) ta-módila ""áyya mðíta hàtxa?} ‘Why is the town like this?’ (A4:31)
The particle may function as a modifier of adjectives, e.g.
(12) ""íman t-íle xêzy6lla,} hátxa š6†ránta-w šapìrta,} ""ay-ßrìxla.} ‘When he saw
her, so beautiful and good-looking, she screamed.’ (A4:4)
(13) ""u-parošyá°a hátxa glòle} ‘pebbles, round like this’ (A23:17)
(14) hátxa faqìra} ‘so poor’ (A40:4)
It is frequently used adverbially, e.g.
(15) mjun6gníla hàtxa.} ‘She shook them like this.’ (A4:15)
(16) dwíq6lla hátxa gu-""íðe dìye.} ‘He took her like this in his hand.’
(A13:25)
(17) šišále gáne hàtxa.} ‘He rocked himself like.’ (A31:7)
14.9.16. hod6x
This is occasionally used as a deictic modifier of a nominal with the sense
of ‘yonder’, e.g.
(1) m-támma hód6x †ùra ""á°‰6 d-ánna dèwele.} ‘From here to yonder mountain
is the land of the wolves.’ (A14:48)the syntax of nominals553It is combined with a demonstrative pronoun in expressions such as
l-ay-gōt-hòd6x t-šaqí°a} ‘on the farther side of the channel’ (A9:1). It is more
commonly used as an adverbial meaning ‘beyond, further’, e.g.
(2) m-táma hód6x t-áz6t má†6t xa-nèra.} ‘Go onwards from there and you
will reach a river.’ (A14:50)
It is often combined with biš, e.g. xá‘‘a xéna biš-hód6x ‘a little further on’
(A7:22). On some occasions it has temporal rather than spatial reference,
e.g.
(3) m-táma hòd6x} ""áxtu ""u-g yanˆxu.} ‘From then onwards you are by yourselves.’ (A8:27)
14.9.17. ‘u
This is used as a negative determiner in the sense of ‘not any.’ The predicate of the clause in which it occurs is itself always negative, e.g.
(1) ""u-†lálux lan-šwíqa ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘and for you I have not left anything.’
(A2:11)
(2) ""ána bsìmli} ‘ú-mdi li°-bìyi.} ‘I am cured, nothing is the matter with
me.’ (A4:20)
(3) ta-t-‘ú-mdi là-""a°e bíye dìye.} ‘so that nothing will happen to it.’
(A7:9)
(4) ‘ù p6lxána la-pálx6t ""áti.} ‘You shall do no work.’ (A23:32)
(5) hon-dèry6lle gu-xa-‘ále ""amúqta lá-""am6ß ‘ù-ga ‘ú-ga pal6†.} ‘I have put him
in a deep hole and he will never be able to come out.’ (A22:41)
The negation can be reinforced by prefixing the particles la and har, e.g.
(6) la-har-‘u-dúk°a lì°wa.} ‘She was nowhere at all (to be found).’
(A27:26)
14.9.18. hi‘
The particle hi‘ is used with the same function as ‘u by some speakers,
e.g. hi‘-nàša} ‘nobody’ (A8:2). It may be combined with the indefinite
article, e.g.","[589, 590, 591, 592]"
"724chapter fifteen(1) ""íman má†6n têmm6l,} ""áw t-áwe pláxa gu-bˆ°a.} ‘When I arrive tomorrow,
he will be working in the house.’
(2) qa-d-áwwa ""áw6ð xa-‘ˆra,} ""6n-t-áwe ràqa,} qa-t-""áw6ð xa-‘ˆra qa-gáne.} ‘so
that he could find a solution, so that, if he had to flee, he could
find for himself a solution.’ (A18:17)
It may denote a perfective future action that has a quantifiable duration.
This differs from the b6d-qa†6l form, which is unmarked with regard to the
durability of the action, e.g.
(3) tre-†¬á yománe xéne bt-áw6t ma†róye xàß-sùsa.} ‘You shall ride on horse
back two or three more days.’ (A8:46)
The t-awe q†ala form may also be used to express a temporally delimited
habitual activity in the future. In (4) the existence of an endpoint is implied
by the question ‘until when?’ In (5) the sense is that the horse will be
screeching during each interval of time in which the salt strikes his legs:
(4) hal-""ìman t-áw6t hátxa mdagóle?} ‘For how long will you be telling lies?’
(A26:56)
(5) mèlxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye,} t-áwe súsa mßarßòre.} ‘Salt will strike his legs
and the horse will screech.’ (A24:12)
In (6) it is used as a modal progressive, expressing deontic possibility in
a question, which is one of the functions of the b6d-qa†6l form (§15.1.5.2.
examples 16–18):
(6) ""ˆka t-áwe mašmóye?} ‘Where could he be listening?’ (A35:20)
In (7) the form is used to express an iterative activity in the past that is
temporally limited, which, as we have seen (§15.4.2.7.3.), is expressed
elsewhere with the y-awewa q†ala form. The purpose of using the t-awe
form of hwy is to express sequentiality to what precedes, which is one of
the functions of the b6d-qa†6l form (§15.1.5.4.):
(7) wírra š6kwánta qam7°a šqilála ða-˙ábba ""u-plì†la.} wírra t-tèrte šqilála

ants were going in one by one until the wheat finished.’ (A36:5)the syntax of verbs72515.4.2.8.5. wele q†ala
The perfective q†ille form of hwy is combined with the infinitive to express
a complete event in the past that has a finite duration with a starting-point
and end-point. The distinction between wele q†ala and other narrative
verbal forms such as q†ille and q†il5le is that this infinitive form explicitly
expresses duration in the past whereas the others do not specify this. Since
the event expressed by this form has an endpoint, it can be followed by
sequential actions, as is the case in (3) and (4):
(1) m6n-d-7-dan6t brèla} hál d-5-dán6t m†éla l-yàla,} wéla bxàya.} ‘From the
time she was born until the time that she came to the boy she wept.’

(2) ""ána k6mà dána t-in-mßalóye †la-márya ""àlaha} ta-t-yawèlli ""êmma dáwe.} ""u""áwwa huðáya wéle maßyó°e n†ára ""èlli l-gàre.} ‘I was praying to the Lord
God so many times to give me a hundred gold coins. This Jew was
listening and watching me on the roof (during this time period).’
(A6:10)
(3) har-wéla taq-táq mxàya} ""u-taq-tàq,} xá-bena-w trè,} w-áwwa sqìdle.} ‘They
made a taq-taq knocking noise, taq-taq, once, then twice, then he

fly come out of the nose of the king and was astonished. He waited
(for some time) and then he saw the fly come back out of the pile
of stones.’ (A11:5)
Rather than denoting a complete event bounded by a start and an end,
the form is sometimes used ingressively to denote the start of a situation
without any definite endpoint. Another event mentioned in the ensuing
discourse, therefore, may take place while this situation still holds rather
than being sequential to its completion, e.g.
(5) ""ána síqa l-ßˆda,} dúnye wéla ràya,} ""ána wírri gu-xa-gêppa.} ‘I went up
hunting, it started raining and so I went into a cave.’ (A28:6)
(6) xá-ga xéta †líbla m6n-márya ""àlaha,} kúlla wéla bráka †lìbla,} ßléla mê†ra.}
‘Then they made a request from the Lord God, they all started
kneeling and made a request, and (as a consequence) rain fell.’
(A11:18)
(7) ""a-políse wéla pyáša b-x6mmèy.} ‘The policemen began to become worried.’ (A8:10)726chapter fifteen15.4.2.8.6. wiy5le q†ala
This form is attested in (1), where it is used to express an enduring but
complete event in the past that has a finite duration with a starting-point
and end-point. As we have seen, the same function is performed by wele
q†ala. This arises from the fact that the q†ille and q†il5le forms are used
interchangeably in narrative.
(1) ""è°y5le xa-nàša} xa-súsa smòqa,} kúlle lwíša smòqa,} wíy6x pláša m-""aßèrta

all dressed in red. We fought from evening until morning. I could
not prevail against him.’ (A12:19)
15.4.2.9. Combined with Existential Particle
The infinitive form pyaša is sometimes combined with the existential particle when the verb has the sense of ‘to remain’. All the attested examples
have the negative particle:
(1) ‘ú m6ndí lítla pyàša.} ‘She no longer had anything.’ (A26:59)
(2) lítlux pyáša pêrß6t,} dìya qa†lèxlux.} ‘You no longer have any opportunity
(for escape), we shall kill you right now.’ (A26:76)
(3) li°-pyáša ""ánna t-amrèxxa bòla díye.} ‘No more of its heads, as we call
them, remain.’ (B5:97)
15.5. Other Constructions with the Infinitive
15.5.1. General Remarks
In some sections of the foregoing treatment of the compound infinitive construction with the verb ‘to be’ mention has been made of some
contexts in which the auxiliary verb is omitted. Most examples of this
omission cited above are infinitive constructions in narrative occurring
after a preceding infinitive bearing the copula, or occasionally before a
following infinitive bearing the copula. In such cases the infinitive without the copula expresses an event that is closely connected with that of
the preceding or following clause respectively, in that they are presented
as being components of the same overall event. In this section we shall
examine further contexts in which an infinitive lacking a copula or form
of the verb hwy is used.","[762, 763, 764, 765]"
"770chapter fifteen15.13. The Expression of the Direct Object of Verbal Forms
15.13.1. Pronominal Direct Object
The expression of the pronominal object on the various verb forms has
been described in §8.19. We may recap here as follows. The direct pronominal object on verb forms derived from the present and imperative
bases is expressed by L-series suffixes. These suffixes derive historically
from phrases consisting of the preposition l-, used in this context as an
object marker, and the pronominal suffix, e.g.
qa†lále
qa†láli
q†úlle
q†úlule‘She kills him’
‘She kills me’
‘Kill (sing.) him!’
‘Kill (pl.) him!’When the pronominal object is 3rd person, it may be expressed by the
inflection of the past base: q†il- (ms.), q†ila- (fs.), q†ili- (pl.), e.g.
q†ílle
q†ilále
q†ilíle‘He killed him’
‘He killed her’
‘He killed them’In practice, the form q†ílle with the incorporated 3ms. object, tends to be
avoided. Most examples in the text corpus of pronominal objects incorporated into the past base are 3fs. and 3pl. objects, e.g.
(1) muttále xàß-súsa bá°re dìye.} ‘He put her on the back of the horse
behind him.’ (A29:37)
(2) la-x6zyàli.} ‘I did not see her.’ (A26:11)
(3) qímle šqilìle.} muttìle} r6š-d-5-""ˆna.} ‘He took them and put them on top
of the spring.’ (A15:1)
(4) m5d6‰ìlux.} ‘You have brought them back.’ (A17:14)
When the pronominal object is 3ms, the functionally equivalent q6m-qa†6l
form with an object L-suffix tends to be used, e.g.
(5) q6m-dawqàle.} ‘She took hold of him.’ (A22:19)
(6) q6m-†arèdle °éle zìlle} be-""ámte dìye.} ‘He drove him away and he went
back to his aunt’s house.’ (A23:33)the syntax of verbs771The q†ille form with an incorporated 3ms. object tends to be used in
clauses that are closely connected to the preceding clause. In such contexts
pronominal objects sometimes have zero realization in other verbal forms
(see examples 8–17 below), so this may also be the case here. In (7), for
example, the clause in question is an elaboration of the previous clause
and does not advance the discourse:
(7) nìxl6n m-’úxo,} drél6n l-Zàwa.} ‘We have got rid of ’uxo. We’ve put
him in the Zab.’ (A7:19)
The q6m-qa†6l form with an L-suffix is also used as an optional alternative
to q†ille to express a 3fs. and 3pl. pronominal object and as an obligatory suppletive form of q†ille to express 1st or 2nd person pronominal
objects.
Compound verbal forms consisting of a resultative participle or an infinitive express a pronominal object either by L-suffixes or by a pronominal
suffix attached to the preposition ""6ll-. The latter is obligatory when the
participle or infinitive does not have a copula enclitic, e.g.
hóle q†íl6lle
y-áwe q†íl6lle
If the there is a copula enclitic, the most common means of expressing
the pronominal object is by L-suffixes. The use of the longer ""6ll- phrase
produces a heavier morphological form with a greater number of syllables.
When the copula enclitic is 3rd person, the ""6ll- phrase is generally placed
before the copula, e.g.
Default form with L-suffix
q†il6lle (q†il5le-le)
q†il6tle (q†il6t-le)
q†il6nne (q†il6n-le)Heavy form with ""6llq†il6llele (q†ila-6lle-ile)
q†il6t-6lle
q†il6n-6lleOn some occasions a pronominal direct object is not marked on a transitive verb, but it is appropriate to supply them in an English translation.
Such zero object anaphora tends to be used when the speaker presents
the clause as denoting an action that is closely related to what precedes,
belonging together with it as part of the same overall event, e.g.","[808, 809, 810]"

""7-brat6t malušíwala jùlle} t-oðíwala ""ax-kàlo.} ‘They made the girl whom
they dressed in clothes like a bride.’ (B7:2)
hat šmí†le ""5-sála t-wéwa zqìr6lla.} ‘Until the basket which he had
woven was shattered.’ (A20:4)In the context preceding (7), it has already been stated that the character
in question wove the basket. The assertion of the relative clause, therefore, must be expressing recapitulatory backgrounded information. An
assertion with such a low degree of informativeness appears, indeed, to
be closely related pragmatically to a presupposition. It is, no doubt, for
this reason that a relative construction is used to express both types of
clauses. Moreover the less informative the relative clause is, the more it
serves as a device to recapitulate and refresh the identification of the
noun, the closer it is in function to that of a restrictive relative clause.
The pragmatic relationship between a presupposition and an assertion
can be regarded as a continuum rather than a clear dichotomy, which
one can represent thus:
Presupposition > Recapitulatory backgrounded assertion > backgrounded
assertion > foregrounded assertion
It follows, therefore, that the relationship between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is a continuum rather than a distinct dichotomy.
A feature that is distinctive of many non-restrictive clauses is the absence
of a correlative demonstrative on the head noun that binds the head to the
relative clause. In examples (1)–(4) the head has no demonstrative. In some
cases the head noun has a demonstrative, but this cannot be interpreted
as having a correlative function. Consider the following cases:
(8)xzìg6n} ""áyya bráta šapìrt6 t-íla dmíxta kêsli.} ‘Look at this beautiful girl,
who has fallen asleep with me.’ (A26:6)
(9) ""u-d5r7le r6š-d-ó-sela t-íle núra xó°e xamìma.} ‘They put it on the griddle, under which there is fire (and which is) hot.’ (B6:47)
(10) hat šmí†le ""5-sála t-wéwa zqìr6lla.} ‘Until the basket which he had
woven was shattered.’ (A20:4)
In (8) the speaker deixis demonstrative is ostensive and points to the referent in the speech situation, the relative clause supplying an additional
description of the girl, which is not essential for identifying the referent
of the noun. In (9) and (10), already considered above, the head nounsyntactic subordination of clauses957has been mentioned previously and there are no competing referents in
the context. The default demonstratives, therefore, can be interpreted as
binding the noun anaphorically to the preceding context. Since, however,
in both cases the relative clauses are low in informativeness and recapitulate information that has already been given, it can be said that they play
a role of refreshing the identification of the head noun, especially since
the head nouns have no other attributes that assist in identification. The
demonstratives would, therefore, have some kind of anaphoric relationship also with the relative clause as well as with the mention of the noun
in the preceding context.
In (11) the head noun has the demonstrative + indefinite article construction (""an-xa), which links the noun anaphorically with an earlier conversation
in the memory of the interlocutor (§14.3.5.). The relative is non-restrictive,
since the noun refers to the entire class and does not extract a sub-set
of ‘washing-boards’ that is in contrast to another sub-set. As in (9) and
(10), the content of the relative clause is recapitulatory in nature and is
intended to assist refreshing the identification of the referent:
(11) q6m-qa†líle b-xa†oryà°a,} ""an-xá xa†oryá°a t-ínwa màr6llux} mási jùlle bíya.}
‘They killed him with washing-boards, the washing-boards which
I was telling you they used to wash clothes with.’ (B19:9)
The head of a non-restrictive relative may be an adverbial expression, as
in constructions such as (12) and (13):
(12) ""•dyo t-íla mì°ta,} hótu pšàma ""•lla díya.} ‘Today, when it has died, you
are sad about it.’ (A5:10)
(13) dìya} t-xzéle málka dúnye ráya pà‰e} zawn-šlàm5le.} ‘Now that the king
has seen it raining lambs, it is the time of peace.’ (A1:26)
A non-restrictive relative clause sometimes has the form of a nominal
relative clause, with a pronominal head, placed in apposition to the
antecedent noun, e.g.
(14) ""ína bráta d-o-Xáno Lapzèrin,} d-o-t-wéwa b•nya D6mdêma,} b>yáwa
ta-bròn-màlka.} ‘But the daughter of that Xano the Golden Hand,
who had built D6md6ma, loved the son of the king.’ (A11:17)
(15) ""•°y5le ""o-gàw‰a díya,} ""o-t-wéwa mù°y6lla.} ‘That husband of hers came
back, the one who had brought her.’ (A12:53)958chapter nineteen(16) m•re †la-xuláme dìye} ""o-t-wéwa ""•°ya m6n-ßˆda} ‘He said to his servant,
who had come from the hunt’ (A25:54)
(17) m-yêmmin šmít6lla ""áyya,} m-bnòn-mámi ""an-t-w7wa gò‰e.} ‘I heard this
from my mother, from my cousins, who were older.’ (B8:5)
These types of construction typically occur where the referent of the
head noun is unambiguously identifiable due to the noun being a proper
noun (15) or a noun that is delimited by a pronominal suffix (16–17). The
head noun is, therefore, not dependent on the relative clause either for
primary identification (restrictive) or for a refreshment of identification
as in (9) and (10) described above. The relative clause, therefore, can be
said to be pragmatically more independent from the head nominal than
is the case with restrictive constructions and constructions such as (9) and
(10). This greater degree of pragmatic independence is reflected by a
greater degree of syntactic independence, in that the nominal relative is
potentially a free-standing item, which is in apposition to the preceding
noun. An attributive relative clause without this opening demonstrative,
on the other hand, is a dependent modifier and is linked indissolubly to
the antecedent noun.
Note that in (14) and (15) the antecedent noun has a demonstrative,
which refers anaphorically to the preceding context. In (14) the genitive
particle that is attached to the head noun (d-o-Xáno Lapzèrin) is repeated
on the appositive relative phrase (d-o-t-wéwa b•nya D6mdêma). For this phenomenon in other appositional constructions see §14.7.
In (18) an appositive type of non-restrictive relative clause follows a head
noun whose referent is a generic class and so is assumed to be identifiable:
(18) béna ""í° linyà°a,} lìne,} linyá°a ""an-t-íla ""àxÄar.} ‘There were pots, pots,
pots, which are green.’ (B10:75)
In some cases clauses expressing supplementary background information
which could be translated idiomatically into English by a non-restrictive
relative clauses are presented as an independent clause juxtaposed asyndetically after a definite noun, e.g.
(19) ßléla yóm6t trè} ""al-f 9qih,} ""ítle d6kkàna.} ‘She went down the next day
to the jurist, who had a shop.’ (A22:16)
(20) módi b6d-manáy6 d-áyya †àsa} dàwa,} šqilál6n m-àxxa,} n6blál6n gu-d-yáha
dˆrta?} ‘What about the meaning of that golden bowl, which we took
from here and took away to that house enclosure?’ (A15:17)syntactic subordination of clauses95919.1.1.2. Indefinite Head Nominal
When the head nominal is indefinite, an attributive relative clause may
be syndetic or asyndetic.
(i) Restrictive Clauses
When the relative clause after an indefinite head noun is restrictive, the
construction is usually syndetic. Only an indefinite noun with a non-specific
referent can have a restrictive relative clause. The restrictive relative clause
does not assist in identification of the referent, since indefinite nominal
phrases in principle have an unidentified referent. Rather the clause narrows the extension of the set denoted by the noun. In many cases the
indefinite noun has a universal quantifier (kut, kull). The verb in the relative
clause is either in a realis form (1–3) or in an irrealis form (4–6):
(1) kú-duk6 t-íla m5°êtlali.} ‘Bring her to me wherever she is.’ (A4:8)
(2) xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa} ""u-t-yáxla ""•lle dìye.} ‘Let’s look and
find a man who is a hard worker and give her to him.’ (A21:3)
(3) kú-m6ndi t-ítley t-yáwi ""êllux.} ‘They will give you everything that they
have.’ (B7:7)
(4) ku-náš6t ""àw6r,} ku-xayú°6t ""áw6r gu-d-ay-wàdi} ""ánna š6kwáne t-axlìla.} ‘Any
person who enters, every living thing that enters in this valley, the
ants will eat it.’ (A14:55)
(5) hátxa xazêxwale} ku-dùk°a t-awéwa.} ‘We would see him wherever he
could be.’ (B9:29)
(6) kúl-naša t-awéle xa-bròna,} . . . ""i-nablíle l-""ùmra.} ‘Anybody who has a
son, . . . they take him to the church.’ (B6:35)
The difference between the constructions with the realis form and those
with the irrealis form relates to commitment of the speaker to the existence
of the class denoted by the nominal phrase. As remarked, in all cases the
nominal has a non-specific referent. When the realis is used, the speaker
is committed to the existence of at least one referent in the class denoted
by the phrase, although he is not referring to one particular member of
this class. In (1) the speaker is committed to the existence ‘a place where
she is’, i.e. that there is some place where she is to be found. In (2) the
implication is that there is some man who is a hard worker, though the
speaker is not referring to anyone particular in this class. In (3) the implication is that the people in question have some possessions that they can
give. When, on the other hand, the irrealis is used, the speaker is not
committed to the existence of any referent in the class. The existence960chapter nineteenof such a referent is only hypothetical and the class may be empty.1 In
(4) the speaker is not committed to the existence of a person who enters
the valley, but presents it as a hypothetical possibility. It is, therefore,
equivalent to the hypothetical conditional construction ‘If a person were
to enter . . .’. In (5) the speakers are not committed to the existence of any
place where the man in question is to be found, i.e. he has disappeared.
In (6) the speaker presents the birth of a son to a person as a possibility
(= If somebody has a son . . .) rather than a certainty (= When somebody
has a son . . .). It is presented as a hypothetical case with regard to one
representative individual of the set.
It should be noted that in some cases, particularly in subordinate clauses,
the qa†6l or qa†6lwa forms are used in a habitual indicative sense and so are
not formally distinguished from their irrealis usage (§15.1.1.3., §15.1.2.2.).
The realis or the irrealis meaning of the verb in the relative clause must,
therefore, be deduced from the context. In a construction such as (7), for
example, where there is an explicit statement of the existence of referents
of the class, the verb must be interpreted as realis:
(7) ""í°wa baxtá°a t-y8ði t-yàpi.} ‘There were women who knew how to
bake.’ (B5:16)
The use of the realis copula in the relative clause modifier of the predicative noun in (8) commits the speaker to the fact that the person was a
good man who brought the coins. What he is denying is that he became
such a man of his own accord:
(8) l5t-""áti wíya xoš-náša t-it-mú°y6lla ""ánna zùze.} záwna wíy5le t-šlàma} ""ápati píšlux náš6t šlàma.} ‘You have not become a good man who has
brought those coins. Time became one of peace and so also you
became a man of peace.’ (A2:26)
A t- prefix attached to an initial / ""/ verb that has a future sense could, in
principle, be interpreted as the future verbal prefix or the relative particle, e.g.
(9) ku-b7°a t-àzeti} ""áni t-yawìlux.} ‘Every home that you go to will give you
something.’ (B7:7)1
This may be compared to the use of the subjunctive in relative clauses in Romance
languages such as French (cf. Kleiber 1987: 69–75).","[994, 995, 996, 997, 998, 999]"

(11) ßli-mur-""êlle} ‘Go down and say to him . . .’ (A26:37)
When the verbs ßly ‘to go down’ or ""sq ‘to go up’ occur in a tight sequence
to a preceding verb, the sequences can often be rendered idiomatically
by English phrasal verbs containing the elements ‘down’ and ‘up’ respectively, e.g.
(12) zadéle ßàle} gu-xa-‘ále gò‰ta.} ‘He threw him down into a big pit.’
(A22:40)
(13) kút-yum xá-""6rw6n y-ar•qwa y-ás6q qám d-o-dèwa.} ‘Every day one of
our sheep would run up to that wolf.’ (A10:5)
18.3.3. mßy/ ""mß ‘to be able’
When used in a past perfective form (mßele, m6ßy5le), this verb is often combined asyndetically in a paratactic relation with the verb that is dependent
on it, in that the second verb is put in a past perfective form (q†ille, q6mqa†6l, q†il5le), e.g. mßele °ele ‘He was able to come’. The same applies to
negated clauses, e.g. la mßele °ele ‘He could not come’, la mßele q6m-""aw6dla
‘He could not do it’. The second verb in a negative construction is semantically irrealis, since the action did not take place. In principle, therefore,940chapter eighteenan irrealis form would be expected. The use of the realis perfective form
has apparently arisen by morphological attraction. This, no doubt, is the
background also of the positive construction. The majority of examples
from the text corpus are negated or occur in interrogative clauses:
(1) là-mßeli mu°yáli.} ‘I could not bring her.’ (A8:55)
(2) ""áyya bàxta} lá-mßela mxumˆla ""•rwe.} ‘The woman could not keep the
sheep.’ (A10:6)
(3) la-mßél6n s•ql6n ßˆda.} ‘We could not go up to hunt.’ (A26:46)
(4) lá-mßeli zrìli.} ‘I could not cultivate.’ (A30:13)
(5) l7la-m6ßye wíðe ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘They could not do anything.’ (A8:65)
(6) dáx mßéle ""áyya bráta q6m-""aw•dla b-p6lxán6t bˆ°a?} ‘How could he have
made this girl a hard-working housewife?’ (A21:32)
(7) ""ánna tre-yále m8nile m•ßya d6ry•lla gu-šaqì°a?} ‘Who could have put these
two children in the stream?’ (A8:15)
When the verb mßy/ ""mß is in the qa†6l form, expressing the present or
future, the complement verb is in the irrealis form, sometimes introduced
by the subordinating particle D, e.g.
(8) máß6x t-àmr6x} ‘We can say’ (B4:3)
In (9) a perfective past verb is followed by another perfective verb but the
latter is introduced by the subordinating particle D:
(9) bráta làn-m6ßya t-in-mú°y6lla.} ‘I could not bring back the girl.’ (A29:8)
18.3.4. ßbr ‘to dare’
A similar paratactic joining is found after perfective forms of ßbr ‘to dare’,
e.g. ßbirre °ele ‘He dared to come’, la ßbirre °ele ‘He did not dare to come’.
The examples attested in the text corpus are negated:
(1) ""áp-xa m•nna lá-ßbirre rhíwle gu-dìw6n.} ‘Nobody dared to speak in the
reception room.’ (A26:70)
(2) lá ßbírra mßuwêtla.} ‘She did not dare to speak.’ (A24:40)clause sequences941The irrealis form is also attested after the perfective past, e.g.
(3) ""áp-xa lá-ßbirre ""asêqle.} ‘Nobody dared to go up (and do) it.’ (A33:4)
18.3.5. qbl ‘to permit’
The verb qbl ‘to permit’ may be used in a similar syntactic structure. In
the following example from the text corpus it is negated:
(1) ""áw là-qbille °éli.} ‘He did not permit me to come.’ (A46:3)
18.3.6. šry II ‘to begin’
This verb is normally followed by an infinitive (§15.5.5.). When, however,
it is in a perfective past form, it is sometimes followed by a perfective form
of the verb linked to it paratactically in the same intonation group, e.g.
(1) šuréle zmírre b-súsa smòqa.} ‘He started singing to a brown horse.’
(A25:11)
(2) šuréla xrì†la.} ‘She started to gouge it out.’ (A19:6)
(3) šúryela xílela m-©ðàðe.} ‘They began to eat together.’ (A21:21)
18.3.7. prq ‘to finish’
Similarly, the verb prq ‘to finish’ is sometimes combined together with a
verb in the same intonation group, e.g.
(1) bar-príqla kúlla náše šqílla ""arz?q.} ‘After all the people had finished taking provisions . . .’ (B17:12)
18.3.8. pyš majbur ‘to become obliged’
This expression is used to express an obligation and is often prosodically
bonded with the following verb, which expresses the lexical content of
the action, e.g.
(1) páy6š májbur béna xaráya šàte.} ‘In the end it will be forced to drink.’
(A12:47)
(2) píš5le májbur ßêly5le.} ‘He had to dismount.’ (A28:33)942chapter eighteen18.3.9. Cirumstantial Clauses
When a clause is dependent on another clause by virtue of the fact that
it expresses the circumstances of the action of the other clause, this
dependence is often expressed prosodically by combining the two clauses
in the same intonation group, e.g.
(1) kúlla ""•°ye ""itléy š>rá†e t-amríla qa-màlka.} ‘They had all come while having cases to present to the king.’ (A17:31)
(2) hadíya b8ye t-áx6l m•ndi kpìn5le.} ‘Now he wanted to eat something,
since he was hungry.’ (A30:11)
(3) ""u-sulámm6š doqíle lóši xa-jùlla.} ‘They would hold the hive whilst wearing a cloth.’ (B5:178)
18.3.10. Temporal Adverbial Clauses
Similarly, prosodic bonding between main clauses is often used when one
clauses supplies the temporal adverbial setting of the action of the following clause. In such cases the first clauses is idiomatically translated by
supplying a temporal particle such as ‘after’ or ‘when’, e.g.
(1) barzíwa xá‘‘a mkal‘ìwala.} ‘(After) they (the logs) had dried a little, they
would remove their bark.’ (B5:187)
(2) hadíya mkop•šla ßlèla.} ‘Now (after) they had gathered it, they went
down (to the plain).’ (A7:15)
(3) b>láwala yabíšta x6rqá x6rqá gu-qðála díya mabyênwa.} ‘(When) she swallowed a raisin, it could be seen, ring by ring in her neck.’ (A8:63)
(4) m†éle mo°7°6lle xá‘‘a mìya.} ‘(When) he came, she brought some water.’
(A22:28)
(5) hátta Gozáli b-gáne mšudr•tle lˆn °í°a.} ‘Even (when) you sent Gozali
himself, I did not come.’ (A8:94)
18.3.11. Complement of a Clause Constituent
Another context in which clauses occur in a single intonation group due
to their semantic connection is where the second clause functions as a
complement of a constituent in the first clause. In (1), for example, the
second clause should be analysed as the complement of the noun ""urxa
‘way’ (‘the way she learnt’):clause sequences943(1) dáx ""úrxa muxzélux ""•lla lípla ""àwwa šúla?} ‘How did you show her the
way to learn this work?’ (A21:34)
This applies also to clauses that are formally marked as subordinate by
by the particle D. When these are direct complements of a verb, they are
typically in the same intonation group as the verb, e.g.
(2) ""ánna y8ði t-íle duglàna.} ‘They know that he is a liar.’ (A48:3)
(3) b8y6n t-àz6n.} ‘I want to go.’ (A8:65)
(4) máß6x t-àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B4:3)
If, however, the subordinate clause is not integrated into the main clause
as the complement of a constituent, but rather is a complement of the
clause as a whole and so is external to it, this looser relationship is sometimes expressed by putting the subordinate clause in a separate intonation
group, e.g.
(5) ""ána paqðênn5xu} t-azítu b-""úrxa ma†ítu ""êlla.} ‘I shall instruct you, so that
you go on the road and reach her.’ (A8:27)
18.4. Repetition of Clauses to Mark a Discourse Boundary
Some types of repetition across clauses have been described already in
relation to the connective particles (cf. §18.1.1., §18.1.2.). A further type
of repetitive overlap across clauses is described in this section.
In narrative the narrator sometimes repeats the mention of an event that
has already been narrated before recounting the event that is sequential
to it. The informational status of the clause, therefore, may be compared
to that of a topical referent. The purpose of ‘heavy’ coding of topical
information at the front of a sentence is generally to mark some kind of
boundary in the narrative. This is, indeed, the function of the construction under discussion since it is used to signal the onset of a section. It is
a device used by the narrator to present an activity as a new event with
a degree of independence from what precedes. This is usually a result
of the subjective choice of the speaker as to how the narrative should be
staged. The function of this construction is similar to that of subordinate
‘when’–clauses (§19.3.3.) and, indeed, they are often idiomatically rendered
by supplying ‘when’ in an English translation. Examples:944chapter eighteen(1) kúlla twìre qðaléy,} mì°ela.} mì°ela,} ""áwwa rìq5le,} ß•ly5le m†ùšy6lla gáne.}
‘They all broke their necks and died. (When) they died, he fled, went
down and hid himself.’ (B18:6)
(2) xà-yoma} sìqle} l-ßˆda,} tfìqle} xa-""àrya bíye díye.} tfíqle xa-""àrya bíye díye,}
zílle †ál6b ""àrya.} ‘One day he went out hunting and a lion chanced
to come his way. (When) a lion chanced to come his way, he went
to attack the lion.’ (A27:3)
(3) qímle q6m-†arêdle.} q6m-†ar•dle °éle zìlle} be-""ámte dìye.} ‘He drove him

(A23:32–33)

Xere and buried her in the horses’ manger below. (When) she buried
her in the horses’ manger, her son came back.’ (A38:3–4)
The repeated material is in some cases uttered with a different distribution
of stress either across the words of a stress group (5) or within a single
word (6):
(5) map6rxálux šawwà yamá°a,} má†6t l-d-o-qàßra.} má†6t l-d-ò-qaßra,} háw6t

and you will reach that palace. (When) you arrive at that palace, be

(6) ""u-m•†y5le qam-d-o-†ùra.} m6†y7le qam-d-o-†ùra,} xirˆle,} mùjb5le.} ‘He
arrived in front of the mountain. He arrived in front of the mountain, he looked and was amazed.’ (A8:53)
In cases where long morphological variants are available, the long form
is used either in the first clause or in the repeated clause. This can be
regarded as two alternative strategies whereby a heavy morphological
form is used as a boundary marker to signal either closure or onset. In
(7) the first clause has a long form of pronominal suffix on the resultative
participle to mark closure (§15.13.5.), whereas the repeated clause has the
shorter, default form. In (8), on the other hand, the long variant of the
imperative is used in the repeated clause:
(7) ""i°á°a qàmx5le,} p°ìxt6llela t8ra.} p°íxt6lle t9ra,} xzí°6lle bába dìya} ""u-""up-w8zīr
mênne.} ‘While there was flour on her hands, she opened the door.
She opened the door and saw her father and also the vizier who was
with him.’ (A21:26)clause sequences

house of such-and-such a man, and take away the two children.
Get rid of them.’ (A8:8)In (9)–(11) the repeated clause has more lexical material than the first
clause. This again can be viewed as a strategy of using linguistic ballast
to mark a boundary, which should be interpreted as the onset of what
follows. In (9) the repeated clause also exhibits the use of the long alternative form of the 3pl. suffix -l5y (cf. §15.12.):

18.5. Intonation Patterns
The relationship between clauses is also signalled by the pitch contours
associated with the nuclear stress in an intonation group. By means of
intonation contours the speaker conveys to the hearer a wide range of
signals, some of which belong to levels of expression that have no direct
correlations in linguistic structure, such as numerous personal attitudes.
For this reason it was decided not to mark the intonational pitch contours
in the transcription of the texts. Here we shall restrict ourselves to a
brief examination of some of the main intonational signals, with special
attention to those that mark semantic continuity and discontinuity across946chapter eighteenclauses. The semantic connection between clauses is an issue that has
been discussed in numerous places in the foregoing discussion of syntactic
structure.
We may distinguish two basic types of intonational contours that
are relevant for the present discussion, namely a contour expressing
disjunction and one expressing conjunction. Following the terminology that
is customary in the field of intonation, we may refer to these as ‘major
juncture’ and ‘minor juncture’ respectively.
18.5.1. Major Juncture
The intonation expressing major juncture is characterized by a low fall
in pitch at the end of the intonation group. There is sometimes a slight
rise in pitch on the nucleus. Any syllables occurring after the nucleus have
decreasingly lower levels of pitch. This contour is represented by the symbol . It expresses completeness and disjunction from what follows. As is
the case with many syntactic expressions of disjunction, the decision as to
where such a signal of disjunction should be placed is generally governed
by the choice of the speaker as to how he wishes to present the discourse
to the hearer. Examples:
(1) ""o-gó‰a píšle tàma. } ‘The eldest one remained there.’ (A24:5)
(2) xa-n>ßíy6t t-yánna †làlux. } ‘I’ll give you some advice.’ (A24:9)
(3) lá-""awð6t xá-mdi xéna t-la-b-dìyi. } ‘Do not do anything else without
me.’ (A24:9)
Speakers separate clauses with major juncture to express lack of sequentiality in a variety of contexts.
In (4) the major juncture is used to separate two clauses that are not
connected in temporal sequentiality, but rather are overlapping temporally.
The second clause does not complete the first so much as stand in parallel
with it, giving a supplementary description of the same event. Similarly
in (5) the second clause does not follow temporally or logically from the
first but rather elaborates on it:
(4) ""an-míya p7ši trè-q6sme. } kàli. } ‘The water will become (divided into)
two parts. It will stop.’ (A24:14)
(5) wúðuli xa-‘àra. } xzóli xa-darmána qa-""ˆni. } ‘Cure me. Find a remedy
for my eyes.’ (A24:2)clause sequences947In (6) the disjunctive prosody separates a prohibition from a following instruction, which is supplementary to the prohibition rather than
sequential to it:
(6) là-šoq6t t-kále. } máx6t ""•lle díye ta-t-""ás6q payêdle ""o-†úra. } ‘Do not let
him (the horse) stop. Strike him so that he will go up and cross over
that mountain.’ (A24:11)
When the clauses express temporally sequential events, the purpose of
the major disjuncture is to make a clear division between the two and to
signal that they are not seamlessly connected. This may coincide with a
spatio-temporal shift, as in (7) in which the arrival at the palace is separated
from the event of crossing the water in both place and time:
(7) ""u-p5ðêtla ""an-míya. } má†6t l-qáßr6t Parizàda. } ‘You should cross the
water. Then you will arrive at the palace of Parizada.’ (A24:14)
18.5.2. Minor Juncture
The intonational contour that are typically associated with minor juncture
consists of a rise in pitch on the nucleus. This is typically followed by a mid
fall on the syllables coming after the nucleus. Such a contour is represented
here by the symbol . Minor juncture contour signals incompleteness. It
is regularly used on a clausal constituent that is uttered in an intonation
group that is separate from that of the rest of the clause. This applies to
the clause initial subjects and extraposed items in (1)–(4):
(1) báxta yaqùrta, } ""i-màbra. } ‘A pregnant woman will give birth.’
(A24:13)
(2) ""o-gò‰a } m•re ""ána p7š6n láxxa gu-d-áyya mðìta. } ‘The eldest one said
“I shall remain here in this town.” ’ (A24:4)
(3) ""an-š5r°† } láz6m y>ð•tla mòdila. } ‘The conditions—you must know
what they are.’ (A24:10)
(4) sùsux } ""aqlá°e mdurbênnela. } ‘Your horse—his legs have become
wounded.’ (A24:12)
Likewise, if a constituent is placed at the end of the clause in a separate
intonation group, the clause is connected to the postposed constituent by
minor juncture. This applies to (5) and (6), which have a postposed subject
and adverbial respectively:948
(5)
(6)chapter eighteen
""ì°wale } †¬à bnóne. } ‘He had three sons.’ (A24:1)
t-yáxlux xamšì dináre } kut-yàrxa. } ‘We’ll give you fifty dinars every
month.’ (A24:7)When the speech reported by the verb ‘to say’ is placed following it in a
separate intonation group, the clause with this verb regularly has minor
juncture, e.g.
(7)qím5le m•re qa-bnóne dìye: } bnòni } wúðuli xa-‘àra. } ‘He said to
his sons “My sons, cure me!” ’ (A24:2)Minor juncture is typically used in clauses that occur in non-final position
in a sequence, the final clause in the sequence being marked by a major
juncture intonational contour. The clauses connected in this way may be
temporally sequential, as in (8). The effect is to present the two events as
closely linked together. Minor juncture is commonly used in clauses containing the verb qym (9) or a verb of movement (10–11). As we have seen
in §18.3.1. and §18.3.2., these types of verbs also exhibit a tendency to
be closely bound prosodically with what follows by being combined with
a following verb in the same intonation group.
m•lxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye, } t-áwe súsa mßarßòre. } ‘He will get salt
on his legs and will screech.’ (A24:12)
(9) qímela †¬á°na t-bnóne dìye } ""u-zìlela. } ‘The three sons of his set off
and went on their way.’ (A24:3)
(10) zílela m•†ye gu-ðá mðìta. } ""o-gò‰a } m•re ""ána p7š6n láxxa gu-d-áyya
mðìta. } ‘They travelled and arrived in a certain town. The eldest
one said “I shall remain here in this town.” ’ (A24:4)
(11) ""o-zóra zílle b-""ùrxa. } zílle, zílle, zìlle, } ""•šta šáwwa yomàne, } m†éle
xa-náša sàwa. } ‘The young one went on the road. He went along
for six or seven days and came upon an old man.’ (A24:7)(8)In constructions such as those described in §18.4., in which a boundary is
expressed in the discourse by repeating the content of a clause, the first
clause has major juncture and the repeated clause, which is presented as
the onset of a new section, has minor juncture, e.g.
(12) qímela ""an-tre-xéne zìle. } zílela ""an-trè. } ""ap-o-gawàya } m†éle ða-mðìta.
} ‘The other two went off. The two went off. Also the middle
one came to a town.’ (A24:5–6)clause sequences949(13) t-yánnux xámši dináre kut-yàrxa. } kut-yárxa t-yánnux xámši dinàre, }
""u-plúx m6n-d-ànna paloxáye. } ‘I shall give you fifty dinars each
month. Each month I shall give you fifty dinars, now work with
these labourers.’ (A24:5)
Clauses containing the existential particle that introduce a referent into
the discourse frequently have minor juncture. This is because such clauses
are closely connected with what follows in that they typically create the
expectation that the ensuing clauses will elaborate further on the newly
introduced referent, e.g.
(14) ""í°wa xa-màlka. } ""ì°wale } †¬à bnóne. } ‘There was once a king.
He had three sons.’ (A24:1)
18.5.3. Interrogative Clauses
Interrogative clauses are uttered with a rise from a higher level of pitch
than that of minor juncture (1–3). There is a short fall on syllables after
the nucleus. The contour is represented here by the symbol . Negative interrogative clauses that function as a device for drawing attention
to preliminary background material (§18.2.1.) typically have a lower
level of pitch than the normal interrogative contour (4). To distinguish
these two levels of pitch the symbol of the lower level is qualified by the
numeral 1 whereas the symbol for the regular interrogative contour has
the numeral 2:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)mò t-óð6t? 2} ‘What will you do?’ (A24:4)
k6mà t-yátli? 2} ‘How much will you give me?’ (A24:5)
mòdila? 2} ‘What are they?’ (A24:11)
""ánna l7la dmìxe, 1} ""o-rább6n mútt6lla ""áqle díye rš-8q6l bàxta. } ‘While
they were asleep, the monk put his leg onto the leg of the woman.’
(A16:11)When a question is rhetorical and does not expect an answer, it may have
a low fall intonation characteristic of major juncture, e.g.
(5)m•re qá-mo là? } ‘He said “Why not?” ’ (A24:7)950chapter eighteen18.5.4. Asseverative Clauses
Clauses that are intended to make a forceful asseveration are uttered
by speakers with a very high level of pitch, higher than the interrogative pitch contour. It includes a rise and fall. This will be represented as
pitch level 3 by the symbol 3. This type of pitch is typically used, for
example, in asseverations containing the negative particle la (cf. §17.2.
and §17.7.14.2. iii):
(1) la-hóle mì°a. 3} ‘He is indeed dead.’ (A17:2)
(2) A: štélux ‘àyux? 2} B: la-štèli! 3} ‘A: “Have you drunk your tea?”
B: “Indeed I have drunk it!” ’CHAPTER NINETEENSYNTACTIC SUBORDINATION OF CLAUSES
19.1. Relative Clauses
Relative clauses may be attributive and modify a head nominal or they
may stand independently of a head nominal and have themselves the
status of a nominal. We shall refer to these types as attributive relative
clauses and nominal relative clauses respectively.
19.1.1. Attributive Relative Clauses
Relative clauses that have attributive function are always placed after the
nominal that they modify. They may be explicitly connected to the head
nominal by the relative particle D, which is either prefixed to the first
word of the clause or is suffixed to the end of the head nominal, e.g. kutyala t-a°e laxxa ~ kut-yal6t ""a°e laxxa ‘Every child that comes here’. When
the particle is prefix to the first word of the clause, the final /a/ vowel
of the head noun is sometimes centralized to /6/ as is the case when the
particle is suffixed to it, e.g. ""áyya bráta šapìrt6 t-íla dmíxta kêsli ‘this beautiful
girl, who has fallen asleep with me’ (A26:6). The final /6/ is occasionally
elided, e.g. ""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo ‘at the time that the bride came’ (B8:32). A
D particle is sometimes elided, but the final vowel of the head nominal
remains /6/ rather than /a/ as if it were still present, e.g. ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux
gáwa díya ‘the enclosure in which you threw it’ (< ""5-d5rt6t A15:18).
Constructions with the particle D may be termed syndetic relative
clauses. Attributive relative clauses may also be placed after the head
nominal asyndetically, without the particle. The distribution of syndetic
and asyndetic attributive relative clauses is conditioned to a large extent by
the definiteness of the head nominal. A distinction should also be made
between restrictive relative clauses, which limit the reference of the head
noun, and non-restrictive ones, which present supplementary information
concerning a nominal without limiting its reference. This difference in
function sometimes gives rise to distinct syntactic structures.","[977, 978, 979, 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985, 986, 987, 988, 989, 990]"
"the clause
(5)893""o-déwa l7le lá plìxa} ""u-lá zêrya} ""u-lá xzìda.} ‘That wolf has neither
worked, nor cultivated, nor harvested.’ (A10:3)We see from (5) that the items are not necessarily placed at the front of
the clause but may remain in their normal position.
The verb may be gapped after the first clause of the coordinated series,
e.g.
(6)
(7)
(8)""ána lànwa wíða} là x6rbayú°a} là spayú°a †la-‘ú-naša.} ‘I have not done
evil or good to anybody.’ (A14:23)
""ána làn dmíxa,} là-b-l5le,} là-b-yoma.} ‘I have not slept, neither at night
nor during the day.’ (A24:24)
lá-b>y6x la-mìya} ""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘We do not want water or anything
else.’ (A39:12)A series of negated verbal predicates may be coordinated with this type
of construction, e.g.
(9)šuréle mtaxmòne.} gu-d-áy taxmànta} †¬á yomàne} l7le la-xíla-w la-šêtya} ""ula-dmìxa.} ‘He began to think. He was (immersed) in this musing
for three days without eating or drinking or sleeping.’ (A26:19)In (10) the Arabic particle walla ‘and not’ is used by the speaker in this
type of construction:
(10) le-šóq6n lá xolamwà°a} wálla ""àti} wálla yêmmi} wálla ‘u-nàša.} ‘I shall not
let servants, you, mother or anybody (look after them).’ (A8:18)
Similar constructions are attested with existential particles, in which the
negator is either repeated (11) or is placed only before the item in focus
(12):
(11) lí° là-xmara mènne díye} la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘There was not an ass with him,
nor anything (else).’ (A22:25)
(12) la-bàba ""ítle,} la-yêmma ""ítle.} ‘He does not have a father and he does
not have a mother.’ (A14:16)
The unusual construction in (13) with the sequence la ""itle rather than
litle may perhaps be understood in this light. The noun nx6p°a ‘shame’ is
established in a set relationship with what precedes in order to explain
the meaning of the latter:894chapter seventeen(13) xzí hátxa be-nxêp°5le.} lá ""ítle nxêp°a} ‘Look, he is so shameless. He
has no shame.’ (A6:11)
In certain circumstances a negative particle is placed before an infinitive
that is the complement of a main verb if only the infinitive is in the scope
of the negation, e.g.
(14) ""u-kút-xa mšuréle là-dwaqa míya.} ‘Everybody began (to agree) not to
gather water.’ (A24:43)
(iii) Asseveration
The negative particle may be used to express asseveration rather than
negation, especially to dispell possible doubt after questions. In such cases
the particle never bears the nuclear stress, e.g.
(1)A: štélux ‘àyux?} B: la-štèli!} ‘A: “Have you drunk your tea?” B:
“Indeed I have drunk it!” ’If the clause contains a compound verbal form with a copula, the copula
is not replaced by the negative copula, e.g.
(2)A: t-à°eti?} B: la-hóli °àya!} ‘A: “Will you come?” B: “But I am
coming!” ’The negative particle is used to express asseveration also before a negated
clause, as seen in (3):
(3)lá l5-z>dènwa ‘u-bèna.} ‘Indeed, I was never afraid.’ (B5:130)17.7.14.3. Negation of the Verb ‘to know’
The present form of the verb to know exhibits some irregularities.
When combined with the negator la, the first syllable of the verb is often
contracted, e.g. l5ð6n < la-y>ð6n ‘I do not know’, l5ð6x < la-y>ð6x ‘We do
not know’. An alternative negative form is formed by replacing the first
syllable of the verb by mi-, e.g. mið6n ‘I do not know’, miðe ‘He does not
know’. This derives historically from a phrase containing the interrogative
particle (< mo y>ð6n ‘What do I know?, mo y>ðe ‘What does he know?’). It
has now, however, lost its interrogative sense and functions as a negator, as
shown by phrases such as míð6n mòdi} (A1:23) ‘I don’t know what’. Further
examples from the text corpus:the clause895(1) míð6n ""o-b7°a ""ˆk5le.} ‘I don’t know where that house is.’ (A12:63)
(2) kút-yum ""á°ya xàj6tta daryáwa bíye díye} ""áti x7lux ""ˆk5le?} róxux ""ˆk5la-w?}
""u-dáx-it xyà""a?} mìð6n mó.} ‘Every day she came with a pretext (to ask
him) “Where is your strength? Where is your spirit? How do you
live?,” I don’t know what (else she asked).’ (A12:38)
(3) míð6t ""áyya módila mßò°e.} ‘You do not know what she is saying.’
(A38:10)
17.8. Extrapositional Constructions
In many cases a referential participant in a clause is extraposed in initial
position in syntactic isolation. This is normally resumed in the body of the
clause by a coreferential pronominal element that indicates its syntactic
function. In what follows we shall first examine the structural details of
this type of construction and then discuss its function. This section will
consider not only clauses with verbal predicates, but also those with a
copula or existential particle.
17.8.1. Structure
17.8.1.1. Extraposed Element
The extraposed element may be a nominal or an independent pronoun,
e.g.
(1) ""ó-""eða y-amrèxle šèra.} ‘That festival—we call it a šera.’ (B6:22)
(2) ""o-Dáwið mòdi šúle díye?} ‘That David—what is his profession?’
(A16:1)
(3) ""á m5xólta náš6t k yàlo y-oðíwala.} ‘The food—the family of the bride
would make it.’ (B5:7)
(4) ""ána šèmmi ’ùxole} ‘I—my name is ’uxo.’ (A7:18)
(5) ""áti x7lux ""ˆk5le?} ‘You—where is your strength?’ (A12:38)
(6) ""áw mútt6lle šèmme díye Mar-Sàwa.} ‘That—they made its name Saint
Sawa.’ (B6:30)
The extraposed nominal is sometimes uttered in a separate intonation
group, e.g.","[931, 932, 933, 934]"
"syntactic subordination of clauses1019(11) ""6n-lá gal•tli ""ánna šaqyá°a módi gu-rèšux,} ""ánna brinán6t mòdila} . . . ""6n-là
gal•tli,} ""ána lˆ-q5ß6nne káwsux.} . . . là q5ß•nne káwsux,} ""•lla t-amr•tli ""ánna
ma-brinànela gu-réšux.} ‘If you do not reveal what these scars on your
head are, what these wounds are from . . . if you do not reveal this
to me, I shall not cut your hair . . . I shall not cut your hair, unless
you tell me what these wounds are on your head.’ (A29:5–6)
Clauses expressing insistence that open with ""•lla are sometimes used
independently of a preceding main clause, e.g.
(12) kízla bíye dìye,} m•ra ""êlla gáwr6t.} ‘They tried (to persuade) him and
said “You must marry.” ’ (A16:6)
(13) m•re lá b-àlaha,} ""•lla maßl•nn6x ""àna.} ‘No, by God. I shall take you
down.’ (A29:27)
(14) là} ""ána har-bt-àz6n.} ""•lla xazyánne xòni.} ‘No. I shall still go. I must
see my brother.’ (A8:66)
In (15) it is combinded with the expression of obligation g>r6g:
(15) ""êlla g8r6g ""áyya bráta gor•nna.} ‘I must marry this girl.’ (A12:55)
The construction is sometimes used in the context of oaths, e.g.
(16) la-málka màmi} hóle y•mya b-rèši.} máttu jallàde} ""•lla b-qa†êlli.} ‘Indeed
the king my uncle has sworn on my head (to execute me). He will
appoint executioners and (has sworn) he will kill me.’ (A25:36)
The particle ""6lla may be used to insist on the veracity of a factual statement, e.g.
(17) ""u-""áwwa-≥i huðáya l-gàre} ""êlla,} ""ánna dáwe ""àn6n hiw•llux.} ‘But this Jew
on the roof (said) “I insist that it was me who gave you these gold
coins.” ’ (A6:11)
Insistence on a prohibition may be expressed by using a construction
opening with ""6n-lá independently of a main clause, paralleling the use
of ""•lla to express insistence on a command, e.g.
(18) ""á-ß6pra ""íla ròxi,} ""6n-lá qa†líle ""o-táwr6t wàla,} šaqlíle ""o-ßêpra.} ‘That
sparrow is my spirit. They must not kill that wild ox and take that
sparrow.’ (A12:41)1020chapter nineteenThe insistent function of ""•lla is sometimes used to express the sense of
‘only if ’, e.g.
(19) ""ána mí°6nwa l-márya ""alàha} ""•lla t-a°yáwa báxta bà°ri,} t-azànwa.} ‘I
had sworn to the Lord God that only if a woman came after me
would I go.’ (A8:94)
An alternative way of expressing ‘only if ’ is to use the particle ""ax‘i combined with ""6n, e.g.
(20) nablánnux l-""á°‰6t bàbux,} ""áx‘i ""6n-y>ð•tla ""à°‰a.} ‘I shall take you to the
land of your father, only if you know the land.’ (A14:89)
The particle ""•lla may be used to express exclusivity also in other contexts,
including before a nominal (22–23):
(21) lí° b>jàra} ""•lla bt-àz6x.} ‘There is no alternative but that we go.’ (A8:27)
(22) w-ána hon-m•rta †la-Nozàli} ""ána l5-gáwr6n ""•lla xóna díya Gozàli.} ‘I said
to Nozali that I would only marry her brother Gozali.’ (A8:95)
(23) díya ""•lla xá-mdi dàwa b8yi.} ‘Now they want only something made
of gold.’ (B10:40)
It is used also as a clausal connective in the sense of ‘but’, ‘but rather’, e.g.
(24) ""u-‘ú b6‰-náša la-má†e-lla ""•lla b-rzáy6t gána-diya t-à°ya.} ‘Nobody can
reach her, but rather she comes of her own will.’ (A8:65)
(25) ""u-""ùp-ati p7š6t m•nn6n,} ""árpa xon>wà°6x.} ""•lla b-šaqlênna} xá°6t Mir-Zándin barxênna-llux.} ‘You also should become (one) of us and (make)
four brothers. But I must (first) take the sister of Mir Zandin to
marry her to you.’ (A26:39)
19.5.6. Non-Conditional Uses of the Particle ""6n
The particle ""6n is sometimes used outside of conditional contexts. These
include the following.
19.5.6.1. Disjunctive Particle (‘either . . . or’)
Several speakers use ""6n as a disjunctive between items. It is used either
before each item ""6n . . . ""6n (‘either. . . . or’) or only before the final item. The
items may be clauses (1–2) or constituents of clauses (3–5)syntactic subordination of clauses1021(1) ""6n-qa†l•nnux ""áyya bráta šaqlênna} ""6n-la-pál†6n m-àxxa.} ‘Either I shall kill
you and take this girl or I shall not go out from here.’ (A29:28)
(2) là-barya} gànwi} ""6n-sàlbi.} ‘They cannot steal or plunder.’ (A29:39)
(3) ""ána hon-yêmya} ""áyya bráta hon-""•°ya nablênna} ""6n-b-našù°a,} ""6n-b-xˆla,}
nabl•nna la-bàbi.} ‘I have taken an oath. I have come to take this girl
either humanely or by force to my father.’ (A29:65)
(4) xàr°a} ""áxni gu-ma°wà°a} kúll5ni j>m•xwa m-©ðàðe,} ""6n-qàša m•nn6n}
""6n-múxt6r6t mà°a,} zavr•xwa ""eð>wà°a.} ‘Afterwards, all of us in the
villages gather together, either with a priest with us or a head of
the village, and we go around (offering) festival blessings.’ (B6:13)
(5) x•lya t-heywàne} t-""•rwe ""6n-tawrà°a,} x•lya mar6x°ìle.} ‘They boil the milk
of animals, of sheep or cows.’ (B6:37)
When the particle is used before a copula clause, the copula may be
attached to it, as is the case when it has a conditional function (6), or the
copula may remain in its normal position on the predicate (7–8):
(6) ""Øx ""áw gáw‰i m-jàlde hóle zíla} lá-""6°ya l-b7°a ≥àre,} ""6n-ile-q†ìla,} ""6n-ile xìla.}
‘Oh, that husband of mine has gone out early and has not returned
home, poor man. He has either been killed or he has been eaten (by
wild animals).’ (A39:17)
(7) y-azíwa be-k yàlo.} ""6n-d-à-ma°5le.} ""6n-d-a-má°a xèt5le} y-azíwa y-atwíwa
táma be-kyàlo.} ‘They went to the house of the bride. Whether it was
in the village or in another village, they would go and sit there in
the house of the bride.’ (B5:28)
(8) š>vána modìle?} kut-náš6t ""ítle ""êrwe,} ""6n-""•rw6t xwàrela,} ""•rw6t kòmela,} yá'ni
""êzzela,} ""6n-wànela.} ‘What is a shepherd? Anybody who has small
cattle, whether they are “white small cattle” or they are “black small
cattle”, that is whether they are goats or are sheep.’ (B5:109)
19.5.6.2. Interrogative Particle
The particle ""6n is sporadically used at the front of direct polar (yes–no?)
question, e.g.
(1) ""amr•xlux ""ítl6n xá zêqqa} ràba gó‰t5la.} y-ásq6x m7°6x míya m6n-d->wàha
†úra.} rába rê˙q5le ""o-†úra.} ràba r•˙q5le.} ""•n máß6t šaqlêtla?} ‘We say to
you that we have a water-skin that is very large. We shall go up and
fetch water from that mountain over there. That mountain is very
far away. It is very far away. Can you take it there?’ (A39:9)1022chapter nineteen19.5.7. Conditionals with madam
On some occasions constructions that can be rendered into English as
conditionals have the particle madam in the protasis rather than the usual
conditional particle ""6n. The use of madam is restricted to clauses describing a situation that the speaker knows is true. For this reason the particle
in the protasis clause can usually be approprately translated also by an
factive English subordinate clause such as ‘since (it is the case that) . . .’.
The particle madam is generally connected to the following clauses by the
D subordinator, though this is omitted in some cases, e.g.
(1) mádam hàtx5la} t-áz6n †8y6n bá°6r ˙aqqù°a} ""u-na-˙aqqù°a.} ‘If (the world)
is like that, I shall go and search for what is lawful and what is
unlawful.’ (A15:5)
(2) mádam t-íw6t hàtxa} háyyo láxxa t-awð•nnux w9zīr.} ‘If you are like this,
come here and I shall make you the vizier.’ (A21:41)
(3) mádam bráti wéla b-p6lxàna} ""u-lípla p6lxàna} b8y6n t-y9ð6n} ""áwwa b6‰-náša
mòdile,} dáx mßéle ""áyya bráta q6m-""aw•dla b-p6lxán6t bˆ°a.} ‘If my daughter
has become hard-working and has learnt to work, I want to know
what (kind of person) this man is, how could he have made this girl
a hard-working housewife.’ (A21:32)
(4) ""áwwa mádam ""ì°wale} bàxta,} ""í°wale bnòne,} ""í°wale nàše,} ""áwwa lˆle mí°a.}
‘If he had a wife, he had sons, he had relatives, he is not dead.’
(A17:17)
(5) madam-t-íw6t ""áyya wìð6lla kúlla,} si-m7°ili q6ßß•tt6t W7rda-w Nˆrgis.} ‘If
you have done all of this, go and bring me the story of W5rda and
N5rgis.’ (A24:35)
(6) hàyyo,} hàyyo!} madam-t-íw6t ""àti,} hàyyo!} là-""az6t.} ‘Come, come. If it is
you. Come, don’t go.’ (A24:36)
19.5.8. Conditionals with ""5-ga
Similarly a clause introduced by the adverbial ""5-ga referring to a situation
that the speaker knows is true may sometimes be rendered idiomatically
by an English conditional, e.g.
(1) ""7-g6t m6n-d-ánna hàwe,} šúla bt-áz6l l>-qàma!} ‘If there are these (gold
pieces), the job will go ahead!’ (A4:15)syntactic subordination of clauses102319.5.9. Asyndetic Conditional and Temporal Constructions
On a number of occasions the semantic relation between a series of clauses
is that of condition and consequent, but they are juxtaposed asyndetically
without a conditional particle. It is often appropriate to translate such
clauses by an English conditional sentence. They often contain verbal
forms that are characteristic of ""6n conditional constructions., e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)""ána t•mm6l ""à°ena,} ""áti mxazdêtli.} ‘If I come tomorrow, you will
blame me.’ (A21:43)
""àti} díya ""á°6t gu-b7°i la-pàlx6t,} lè-yannux ""ixála.} ‘If you come now, come
to my house and do not work, I shall not give you food.’ (A21:36)
xàz6n} màß6n} t-óð6n xa-‘àra.} là-amß6n,} maqê†lu bróni,} mó t-oðèna?} ‘I
shall see whether I can find a solution. If I cannot, have my son
killed, what can I do?’ (A33:6)
mqáwl6t goràtle,} t-yálla jùlla.} ‘If you promise to marry him, he will
give back the clothes.’ (A14:83)
gúrza maxèle} ""áy bá≥6r kúlla t-aw•dla mìya.} ‘If he struck with his club,
he would make all of that town turn to water.’ (A52:15)
l7le jyàra,} š>y•tle b-gùda.} ‘If he does not pass water, throw him
against the wall.’ (A30:40)
kút-dana ""a-ß•pra mìtle,} ""7-ga ""ana-mˆ°6n.} ‘If ever that sparrow dies,
then I shall die.’ (A12:41)
t•mm6l y•mmi mìtla,} p7š6x ""ána-w bàxti.} ‘If my mother dies tomorrow,
we shall remain, myself and my wife.’ (A21:42)
mu°yále B•lb6l Hazàr,} p7ša kàl°i.} ‘If he brings B6lb6l Hazar back,
she will become my daughter-in-law.’ (A8:34)Such asyndetic conditional constructions are commonly found with the
verb ‘to want’ in the protasis, e.g.
(10) b8y6t ""àxl6t,} xùl!} ‘If you want to eat, eat!’ (A14:59)
(11) ""•rwe hòla gu-†úra.} b9y6t,} s5-mkàp6šla!} ‘The sheep are in the mountains. If you want, go and gather them up!’ (A10:4)
(12) b8ya pˆša,} p7ša ""áy ""àxxa,} b-šóp6t bròn6n} t-óya mal•k°a b-šópi ""íman-t""ána mˆ°6n.} ""u-b8ya d7‰a l-b7°6t bába dìya,} matt•nna xá-ga xèta,} ""àna
m>d6‰•nna.} ‘If she wants to stay, let her stay here in the place of
our son and she will be queen in my place when I die. But, if she
wants to return to her father’s house, I shall put her again (on a
camel) and return her.’ (A4:39)1024chapter nineteen(13) b8y6t b9y6t.} là-b>y6t,} hóle Íaddàm si-škì.} ‘If you want it, you want
it (fine). If you do not want it, there is Saddam, go and complain
(to him).’ (B1:22)
Such asyndetic conditional constructions generally have a rising intonation contour in the intonation group of the first clause, which typically
expresses conjunction with what follows, e.g.
(14) súsux b8ye t-kàle, } là-šoq6t t-kále. } ‘If your horse wants to stop, do
not let him stop.’ (A24:11)
In (15) an asyndetic conditional is followed by a negative alternative condition that has the conditional particle, demonstrating the equivalence
between the asyndetic and syndetic constructions:
(15) m5°êtta-lli,} šoq•nnux t-àz6t.} ""ên-la,} là-šoq6n t-azítu.} ‘If you bring her
here, I shall let you go. If not, I shall not let you go.’ (A12:21)
In (16) the presentative particle ""ina is used to introduce a protasis that
lacks the conditional particle:
(16) ""ína ""ánna xon>wà°i,} ""arbì xon>wá°i,} kúšš6t magúr6t xà,} páy6š ""úmri tmàni
š•nne.} ‘If each year you marry off one of these forty brothers of
mine, I’ll be eighty years old (before I marry).’ (A12:1)
Conditional type constructions are sometimes expressed by imperative
clauses, e.g.
(17) la-xzì} ""u-la-x†ì.} ‘If you do not see, you will not sin.’ (D2:49)
(18) wí mbaqràna,} t-áw6t yaðùwa.} ‘If you are inquisitive, you shall be
knowledgeable.’ (D2:11)
Expressions of a wish that appear unlikely to be fulfilled (‘if only . . .!)
use the qa†6lwa verbal form, which is characteristic of protases denoting
an improbable situation in the future, e.g.
(19) xuš-mˆ°6n} bas-xá°i Nozáli xazênwala.} ‘Let me die, but, if only I could
see my sister Nozali.’ (A8:57)syntactic subordination of clauses1025An asyndetic conditional may lack verbal forms, especially in proverbial
contexts, e.g.
(20) dárta l-yòma,} ""•rwe gu-gòma.} dárta l-sèra,} ""•rwe l-†èra.} ‘If the sun has
a halo, the sheep will be in the basement stable. If the moon has
a halo, the sheep will be in the noon sun.’ (D2:15)
(21) t8ra dwìra} q8da wìra.} ‘If the door is closed, trouble passes by.’
(D2:47)
Asyndetic constructions are used also when a consequent follows a clause
expressing a situation that is presupposed to be true and so has the function of a temporal ‘when’–clause, e.g.
(22) bábi mày6°,} ""ána bt-áw6n málka šòpe.} ‘When my father dies, I shall
be king in his place.’ (A14:88)
(23) t-ámr6x háyyo ßlí K>r≈m ""áti gu-d-áwwa balù'a} . . . ""aw-ßále táma mrap•xle
xáwla b-réše dìye} ""u-""áyya q>páxta matt•xxa r6š-d-o-t8r6t gêppa.} ‘We shall
say “Come Karim, go down into this conduit.”. . . When he goes
down there, we shall throw the rope onto his head and shall put
this cover onto the opening of the cave.’ (A14:16)
(24) ""à-dana} ""áyya nablàlux,} map6rxálux šawwà yamá°a,} má†6t l-d-o-qàßra.}
má†6t l-d-ò qáßra,} háw6t h•šy6r ""ína ""áyya sústa là marp•tla.} ‘She will
take you, she will fly you over the seven seas and you will reach
that palace. When you arrive at that palace, be careful not to let
that horse go.’ (A12:29)
19.6. Concessive Constructions
The syntactic expression of concession is rarely found in the text corpus.
Where this occurs, it tends to take the form of a protasis clause introduced
by phrases denoting literally ‘even if ’ (""ap-""6n / ""up-""6n, ham-""6n), e.g.
(1)
(2)""úp-""6n-iwa xayú°a pšì††a,} ""ánna náše ráb5wa xêðye.} ‘Although the life
was simple, people were very happy.’ (B15:14)
hám-""6n wídle hátxa ""àp-aw,} ""áp ""axni-xìl6xwale táwre díye.} ‘Although he
did such a thing, (we should take into account that that) we had
eaten his ox.’ (A7:20)1026chapter nineteenNote also the use of the Arabic conditional concessive w>-law in (3):
(3) w8-law t-ín ""anna-xámša š•nne zíla b-dùnye,} n•mu lat-ðà""6lli?} ‘Although I
have been away in the world for these five years, don’t you know me
any more?’ (A12:65)
In these sentences, despite the conditional structure, the truth of the protasis is not in question. The concessive sense is that the situation described
in the subordinate clauses might lead one to expect that the proposition
of the main clause would be false but, in fact, this is not the case. A pure
conditional ‘even if ’ construction is related, in that it indicates that the
situation of the main clause is not expected to follow from the condition
but nevertheless will do so. The difference from a concessive construction
is that the truth of the protasis is not certain. There are various ways of
expressing pure conditional ‘even if ’–clauses, including clauses introduced
by a conditional and one of the inclusive particles ""ap/""up, ham and -≥i, e.g.
(4) bnáya gúda ""u-dráya r>ß?ß,} tá-t ""áp-""6n maxíle màdfa'} t-là-tal6xwa gúda.} ‘He
built the wall and put lead into it, so that, even if it was hit by artillery, it would not be destroyed.’ (A11:13)
(5) hám-""6n yaw•tli zùze,} lè-y-a°6n.} ‘Even if you give me money, I shall
not come.’
(6) ""6n-háwe dàwa-≥i} ""áxni t-yaw•xla xa-b-†¬à°a ""•lle díye.} ‘Even if it is gold,
we shall give him threefold (if it is lost).’ (A7:10)
In (7) it is expressed by a simple ""6n clause, but this is given prominence
on a prosodic level by being uttered with a high pitch level:
(7) là-b-alaha,} lá q5ß•nne rèšux,} ""6n-qa†lêtli.} ‘No, by God. I shall not cut
(the hair on) your head, even if you kill me.’ (A29:6)
A concessive relationship sometimes exists between clauses that are linked
paratactically. In such cases the grounds for the reversed expectation,
equivalent to the subordinate ‘although’ clause, is usually conjoined after
the other clause with the connective particle w, e.g.
(8) málka krìble} ""u-b-gáne málka mír5wa ""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.}
‘The king became angry, although the king himself had said “if I
have a daughter I shall give her to your son.” ’ (A25:8)syntactic subordination of clauses
(9)1027píšla d6≥mênne,} ""u-""áni là-x6zye ©ðáðe,} ""u-là-mßu°e hátxa m•ndi.} ‘So, they
became enemies, although they had not met each other and had
not said (to each other) any such a thing.’ (B19:2)Concession may be expressed by an asyndetic conditional type construction, e.g.
(10) tú póìla,} mßáw6° d°s.} ‘Sit crooked (= even though you sit crooked),
tell the truth.’ (D2:60)The Neo-Aramaic Dialect of BarwarHandbook of Oriental Studies

"748chapter fifteen(6) b-7-šeta píšla Dúre muqyàmta-w} ‘In that year Dure was evacuated.’
(B1:8)
(ii) The verb pyš with an ingressive function can be combined with an
infinitive and have the sense of beginning the action in question, e.g.
(1) ""u-táwra píšle mangóle ""áxxa l-tàmma.} ‘The ox began to limp back and
forth.’ (A22:3)
(2) píšt5la mtanóye ða-qêßß6t} †la-qà†u.} ‘She started telling a story to the
cat’. (A14:2)
(3) píšela mnáy6lla l-xà-xa.} ‘They began to count them, one by one.’
(A6:3)
(4) ""áyya m6škènta píšt5la mxàya} dráya qè†ma gu-réša dìya.} ‘The poor woman
began to beat (herself ) and put ash on her head.’ (A14:22)
(iii) Ingressive pyš is occasionally combined with a perfective verbal form
to convey the sense that the event in question is the final outcome of a
chain of events. This is the case in (1), where it is combined with a perfective future qa†6l form:
(1) bas-tàma} qèßß6t dìy6x} ""u-t-xòn6x} p7ša mà†ya} l-xarayú°a dìya.} ‘There your
story and that of your brother will (finally) reach its end.’ (A8:88)
A similar function is sometimes performed by a construction in which pyš is
combined with the resultative participle of a telic intransitive verb, e.g.
(2) tíwela tàma} ""u-xílela ""ixàla} ""u-píše dmìxe.} ‘They sat there, ate food, then
(in the end) went to sleep.’ (A15:8)
(iv) Ingressive pyš is sometimes used in narrative before expressions of
time to mark the beginning of a new episodic section. It may be used to
denote the onset of a point in time, e.g.
(1) píšle yòma} hár wewa-xðàra.} ‘Day came and he was still searching
about.’ (A14:24)
(2) píšt5la ""aßêrta.} gu-sá""6t ""èšta ""aßèrta šáwwa gu-gn7°6t yòma,} hóle °éle ’ùxo,}
xa-bèrra ""èrwe bà°re.} ‘The evening came. At six or seven o’clock in
the evening, at dusk, ’uxo came, with a flock of sheep following
him.’ (A7:21)
(3) píšta mbàdla.} mbádla qìm5le.} ‘Morning came. In the morning he got
up.’ (A14:66)the syntax of verbs749In (1)–(3) above the expression of time can be construed as the grammatical
subject of the verb. The expression of time may also be a prepositional
phrase, as in (4). Here the grammatical subject of the verb, which is 3fs.,
must be impersonal:
(4) píšla b-lˆle,} sìq5le} l-gàre.} ‘At night he went up onto the roof.’
(A25:52)
The verb pyš may also be used to denote the passage of an interval of time.
In such contexts it has 3ms or 3fs inflection. The time expression appears
not to be construed as the grammatical subject, judging by constructions
such as (7), in which a 3ms. verb is followed by a feminine nominal phrase,
and (8), where a 3fs. verb is followed by a masculine nominal phrase:
(5) píš5le xà-yarxa} málka xzéle xa-xèlma xèna.} ‘A month later the king had
another dream.’ (A1:9)
(6) píšle šènne rábe ""árbe xámm6š ""èšš6t šènne la-zìlle.} ‘For many years, four,
five six years, he did not go there.’ (A18:12)
(7) píš5le ða-šáb°a xˆta,} ""ám6r †la-báxta . . . ‘A week later, he said to his
wife . . .’ (A5:8)
(8) p5šáwa xa-yóma trè,} hál barêzwa.} ‘One or two days would go by until
it became dry.’ (B5:167)
15.9. The Expression of the Passive
Various constructions are used to express the passive of a transitive
verb.
15.9.1. q†il
The dialect exhibits a vestigial use of the past base stem q†il to express a
passive action. This is only used sporadically and is restricted to the 3rd
person. As is the case with the q†ille form, the q†il form expresses a specific
event occurring in the past at a particular point in time, e.g.
(1) mèra prúmu rèše!} ""áwwa prìm réše.} ‘She said “Cut off his head!” He—his
head was cut off.’ (A24:31)
(2) bá°6r t-gníw Mar-Qayòma,} q6m-dawríle t9ra.} ‘After (the church of ) St.
Qayoma was plundered, they closed the door.’ (D2:66)750chapter fifteen(3) mó°i júlla dìya.} ‘Her clothes were brought.’ (A4:20)
(4) brátux mù°ya.} ‘Your daughter has been brought back.’ (A29:42)
(5) ""áy wela-""á-bráta xar7°6t m†úmra gu-Dùre.} ‘That was the last girl who
was buried in Dure.’ (B1:12)
(6) ""ína ""an-tre-xéne píšela hál-dan6t t-íxwa ""áxni tàma,} hál-šèt ""álpa ""6óóá-mmaw šáwwi tmànya,} ""íman t-moqìma Dúre.} ‘But the other two remained
until the time that we were there, until the year 1978, when Dure
was evacuated.’ (B1:5)
There are other signs of the fossilization of this construction in addition
to the extreme infrequency of its use. The 3ms. form q†il can be used also
with 3fs. and 3pl. nominal subjects:
gaw‰a q†il
baxta q†ila ~ q†il
naše q†ili ~ q†il‘The man was killed’
‘The woman was killed’
‘The people were killed’Example from the text corpus:
(7) prim-""êrwe.} ‘Sheep were slaughtered.’ (B10:40)
If the agent of the action is expressed in the clause by a nominal phrase,
this is not necessarily introduced by any preposition, e.g.
(8) mú°y6lla qaráw6t dìya} mùtt6lla.} b7°a dwìq} qaráw6t dìya.} ‘They brought
her bed and laid it down. The house was filled by her bed.’
(A21:7)
Both these features reflect a certain degree of opacity regarding the status
of the patient argument as the grammatical subject of the verb. Lack of
agreement of a verb with its grammatical subject would not in principle
be possible elsewhere in the verbal system, but lack of agreement with
a grammatical object would be permissible, especially with indefinite
nominals as in (7). The lack of the preposition on the agent nominal in
examples such as (8) is a property of a grammatical subject, suggesting
that it is competing for this status with the patient nominal.","[786, 787, 788, 789]"
"the syntax of verbs631In principle the subject of a deictic copula has a specific referent and
does not denote a generic class. Examples are sometimes encountered that
appear to go against this principle, such as (6) above where the subject
xètna (‘the groom’) is referring generically to the groom in any wedding.
In such cases the speaker is no doubt presenting the subject as if it were
a specific case of the class concerned for the sake of vividness.
Constructions with the deictic copula are marked with regard to communicative salience, as is the case with the independent basic copula.
It is used in clauses expressing assertive, factive propositions, which are
high in communicative salience in that the speaker is committed to their
factuality, but it is not used to express non-factive propositions such as
interrogative clauses, in which the proposition is being questioned. If the
clause is interrogative, the enclitic copula on the predicate is used.
(13) baxtá°6n hóla yaqùre.} ‘Our wives are pregnant.’
(14) baxtá°6n yaqùrela?} ‘Are our wives pregnant?’
If a question does not relate to the factuality of a proposition, the deictic
copula may be used, e.g.
(15) qa-mó brónux hóle gu-bˆ°a? ‘Why is your son in the house?’
The deictic copula is also used in an assertion that is embedded in a
question, e.g.
(16) lá-m6r5xu ""áyya qußárta hóla b-""ùrxa?} ‘Did you not say that this cooking pot is on the way (to giving birth)?’ (A5:5)
In general the deictic copula is a device for drawing the particular attention
of the hearer to something in the immediate speech situation. This may
be a property of the subject expressed in the predicate that is observable
in the immediate situation, but not necessarily a permanent property, or
a permanent property that is unexpected. Alternatively it may be a referent that is newly introduced into the discourse and, therefore, worthy
of particular attention. In some cases, both of these conditioning factors
may be operative. The ultimate decision as to whether a basic copula or
a deictic copula is used, however, depends on the degree of prominence
that the speaker wishes to give to the subject referent or the predication
in a particular discourse context. Consider, for example, (17):632chapter fifteen(17) xa-šaqòl5le} mkùl‘5le} ""u-xa-xèna} ða-""à†ma} hóla sàxi.} mère ""áyya ""à†ma}
nablètla ""6lla-dìya.} ‘One is a shank, it is stripped (of its meat).
Another, a thigh, is in good condition. He said (to the servant)
“Take this thigh to her.” ’ (A30:30)
Here both the ‘shank’ and the ‘thigh’ are newly introduced referents and
the predications concerning them both denote contingent situations that
exist at the time of speaking. The narrator, however, wishes to give greater
prominence in the discourse to the ‘thigh’ since this is the concern of the
following speech.
The deictic copula may be used to draw attention to the situation as
a whole expressed by a clause when this marks the onset of a section of
discourse and provides the background for what follows. Consider the
wider context of (5) cited above:
(18) málka mère †la-d-o-xóne f>qìra,} mère xòni} baxtá°6n hóla yaqúre t6rwê°na.}
""6n-báxtux mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxti mu°éla bròna,} brátux qa-bròni.} ""6n-báxti
mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxtux mu°éla bròna,} ""a-bráti qa-brònux.} ‘The king
said to the poor brother, he said “My brother, our wives are both
pregnant. If your wife gives birth to a girl and my wife gives birth
to boy, your daughter (will be married) to my son. If my wife gives
birth to a daughter and your wife gives birth to a son, my daughter
(will be married) to your son.” ’ (A25:2–3)
The predicate of the independent basic copula, on the other hand,
expresses that a certain property is a permanent feature of the subject
but does not specify whether this property is observable in the immediate
speech situation. Similarly the independent basic copula does not draw
attention to the subject of the clause, since it is already activated in the
consciousness of the hearer due to its high degree of topicality.
It is likely that the basic copula originated as a presentative construction,
similar in function to the deictic copula that is in use today. This explains
the use of the L-suffixes in the 3rd person, which originally expressed the
object of the presentative. At some stage this old presentative would have
lost its presentative function and been cliticized to the predicate, in conformity with the syntactic position of verbal inflection. This would have
been accompanied by the emergence of a new presentative device in the
form of the deictic copula. The construction with the basic independent
copula placed before the predicate, e.g. brónux ""íle xàwri} ‘Your son is mythe syntax of verbs633friend’ is likely to reflect a transitional stage of this development which
has survived in the modern dialect. As remarked, this construction does
not have an attention-drawing function to the same degree as the deictic
copula, but it nevertheless has greater communicative salience than the
construction with the enclitic copula.
The deictic copula may be used with past tense reference in the context
of clauses with past verb forms, e.g.
(19) xa-pà‰a,} wiðále gáne max-qêšta.} Fárxo ""u-S6ttíye hóla k6s-©ðàðe.} ‘One
lamb made itself like a bow. Farxo and S6ttiye were together.’
(A25:28–29)
(20) qím5le ""ap-Fárxo šqíl6lle zòrna,} mxáya zòrna,} bejíye hóla xa-gòta} ""èrwa
xa-gòta.} ‘Farxo also took up the pipe and played pipe music, the
young lambs were one side and the sheep the other.’ (A25:31)
(21) hóla ""i°á°a gu-lˆša,} lyáša kùbbe,} ""u-""ê°y5le} bába dìya} ""u-w9zìr.} ‘Her
hands were in dough, while kneading the meat-balls, and her
father and the vizier came.’ (A21:26)
(22) múßly6lla dìw6n.} díw6n t-xále díye hóla dwìqta.} ‘He brought them down
to the meeting room. The meeting room of his uncle was full.’
(A23:14)
The deictic copula may be combined with the expressions heš ‘still’, haldíya ‘until now’, and har ‘already, still’, which imply that the situation has
an end-point or starting-point and is not permanent, e.g.
(23) ""áy heš-hóla gu-gòma.} ‘She is still in the basement stable.’ (A18:22)
(24) jullèk°a hóla hár qrúšta rèša.} ‘As for the bowl (of yoghurt)—here, its
crust is still on it.’ (A30:24)
(25) ""áp-""o-†¬a°a q6m-p5rmìle.} ""u-d6bbóre hár-hola qam-t8r6t bòya.} ‘They
slaughtered also the third one. The hornets were still before the
door of the hole.’ (A20:9)
(26) hal-díya hóla gu-móx6n ""áyya ""áxni.} ‘Until now this is in our memory.’
(B16:12)
Occasionally the deictic copula is placed after the predicate, e.g.
(27) ""árye dìye} k6s-báxte dìye hóla.} ‘His lions are with his wife.’ (A18:19)
(28) ""7ne p°ìxt5la,} bas-†lìya hóle.} ‘His eye is open, but he is asleep.’
(A31:6)634chapter fifteenThe deictic copula is sometimes used to present a nominal, denoting its
existence without ascribing any property to it in a predicate, e.g.
(29) hóla ""isèq°a dìya.} ‘Here is her ring.’ (A25:69)
(30) hóla zeðàye.} ‘Here are the breads.’ (A30:24)
(31) hó""la mìya.} ‘Here is some water.’ (A28:18)
15.3.3. The Copula in Subordinate Clauses
The distinction between the various copula constructions described above
are neutralized in subordinate clauses that are introduced by the conditional particle ""6n and the general subordinating particle D. The latter
has various functions, such as a relativizer and complementizer, and is
often combined with other particles. If a copula clause occurs in such
clauses, the enclitic copula is always used, rather than the independent
or deictic copula, and this is attached to the particle at the head of the
clause, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)""6n-íle mì°a,} g8r6g mˆ°6n.} ‘If he is dead, I must die.’ (A8:61)
""6n-ít xonˆni,} háyyo tu-""áxxa k6slˆni.} ‘If you are our brother, come
and sit here with us.’ (A39:7)
""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla} xo-d-áwwa
jùlla.} ‘If he is my nephew, he will come and know what these are
or are not under this cloth.’ (A25:49)
si-prúmle ""áwwa yála zòra} t-íle gu-dudìya.} ‘Go and slaughter this baby
boy who is in the cradle.’ (A15:8)
xìl6lle ""o-""ixála t-íle kêsle.} ‘He ate the food that was in front of him.’
(A23:5)
xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa.} ‘Let’s look for a man who is a
hard worker.’ (A21:3)
""ánna y8ði t-íle duglàna.} ‘They know that he is a liar.’ (A48:3)
l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
(A17:2)15.3.4. Copula on Focused Elements
The distinction between the various types of copula is neutralized also
when the speaker wishes to place a particular focus on one argument of
the clause. In such circumstances only the enclitic copula is used, even
where in equivalent clauses without such argument focus the deictic orthe syntax of verbs635independent copula occurs. The enclitic copula is attached to the focused
element, whether this be the subject or a component of the predicate of
the clause. The focused element bears the nuclear stress and is typically
moved to the front of the clause if is not already situated there. This
type of construction is used when the speaker wishes to put a contrastive
focus on one argument. In what follows the focus is represented in the
translation with italics:
(1) A: bróni hóle gu-bˆ°a.} B: là,} bàbux-ile gu-b7°a,} lá brònux.} ‘A: “My son
is in the house”. B: “No, your father is in the house, not your son.” ’
(2) A: bróni hóle dmíxa gu-bˆ°a.} B: là,} gu-kˆrm5le dmíxa,} lá gu-bˆ°a.} ‘A:
“My son is asleep in the house”. B: “No, he is asleep in the orchard,
not in the house.” ’
(3) A: ""áwwa ""íle xêtna.} B: là,} qrìw5le ""áwwa,} lá xêtna.} ‘A: “This is the
groom”. B: “No, this is the best-man, not the groom.” ’
(4) A: ""áwwa ""ile mtúrßa m6n-kèpa.} B: là,} m6n-qˆs5le mtúrßa,} lá m6n-kèpa.}
‘A: “This is made of stone”. B: “No, this is made of wood, not of
stone.” ’
Examples from the text corpus:
(5) ""áwwa lˆle kálba.} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He is not a dog. you are a dog’ (A11:2)
(6) ""áni xšíwela dêbb5la táma.} ‘They thought the bear (not the bees) was
there.’ (A10:7)
The contrastive focus may be an informationally given referent, as in the
following:
(7) A: ""èdyo xzéli xón6t Dawíð ""u-bròn-màme. bròn-máme ""íle zaqàra.} B: là,} xònele
zaqára,} lá bròn-màme.} ‘A: “Today I saw the brother of David and
his cousin. His cousin is a weaver”. B: “No, his brother is a weaver,
not his cousin.” ’
This neutralization applies only to strong focus, as is the case with contrastive focus. It is not necessarily used with a simple new information focus,
as is seen in constructions such as the following:
(8) A: ""7nile gu-bˆ°a?} B: brònux hóle gu-b7°a.} ‘A: “Who is in the house?”
B: “Your son is in the house” ’.
(9) A: ""ˆnile? B: ""áw ""íle xòni} ‘A: “Who is he?” B: “He is my brother” ’.","[669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674]"
"the syntax of verbs655If the actionality of the verb is telic, the resultative participle can have
both a verbal and an adjectival interpretation. In the verbal interpretation, the predicate expresses the telic event including both its dynamic and
final static endpoint, the subject of the clause being either the agent or
the experiencer of the event. In the adjectival interpretation, it expresses
only the resultant state of the endpoint. Verbs of this nature falling into
the category of achievements, according to the classification described
above, include, for example, ""tw ‘to sit down’, kly ‘to stand up’, †l"" ‘to go
to sleep’, dmx ‘to lie down, go to sleep’, rkw ‘to mount (an animal)’, m†y
‘to arrive’, npl ‘to fall down’, pq"" ‘to split’, sps ‘to rot’, ""ßy/ßy"" ‘to get stuck’,
gðl ‘to become frozen’:
(1) ""áw hóle tìwa}
(2) ""áw hóle †lìya}
(3) ""áw hóle npìla}‘He has sat down’ (verbal)
‘He is seated’ (adjectival)
‘He has gone to sleep’ (verbal)
‘He is asleep’ (adjectival)
‘He has fallen’ (verbal)
‘He is (lying) fallen’ (adjectival)The adjectival function of the resultative participle of such verbs is demonstrated by the fact that it can function as an attributive modifier of the
participant that is affected by the event, i.e. the subject noun, e.g.
(4) ""aw-náša hóle tìwa}
xzáy6nne ""aw-náša tìwa}
(5) ""aw-yála hóle †lìya}
xzáy6nne ""aw-yála †lìya}
(6) ""aw-yála hóle npìla.}
xzáy6nne ""aw-yála npìla.}‘The man is seated’
‘I see the seated man’
‘The child is asleep’
‘I see the sleeping child’
‘The child is (lying) fallen’
‘I see the fallen child’Furthermore the adjectival interpretation of the copula predicate is shown
by the fact that it can be combined with the adverbial heš ‘still’ in cases
where the resulting state is not permanent, e.g. héš hóle tìwa} ‘He is still
seated’, héš hóle †lìya} ‘He is still asleep’.
The category of telic achievements include various verbs that denote
ingressiveness into a state. The subject of these is typically an experiencer
rather than an agent, e.g. pßx ‘to become merry’, xðy ‘to become happy’,
krb ‘to become angry’, my° ‘to become dead, die’:656chapter fifteen(7)""áw hóle xêðya}(8)naša x6ðya
""áw hóle mì°a}
naša mi°a‘He has become happy’ (verbal)
‘He is happy’ (adjectival)
‘A happy man’ (adjectival attribute)
‘He has died’ (verbal)
‘He is dead’ (adjectival)
‘A dead man’ (adjectival attribute)Various telic intransitive verbs have a dynamic component with some
degree of quantifiable durativity and so should be classified as accomplishments, although in some cases the subject is inanimate. These include,
for example, m-qrn ‘to grow up’, m-nty ‘to succeed’, r°x ‘to boil’, ómó ‘to
wither’, qry ‘to study (i.e. to apply one’s mind purposefully to the acquisition of knowledge), be educated’:
(9)bróni hóle mq5rêna}brona mq5r6na
(10) míya hóla r°ìxe
miya r°ixe
(11) ""áw hóle qêrya}
naša q6rya‘My son has grown up’ (verbal)
‘My son is grown up’ (adjectival)
‘A grown-up son’ (adjectival attribute)
‘The water has boiled’ (verbal)
‘The water is boiling’ (adjectival)
‘Boiling water’ (adjectival attribute)
‘He has studied’ (verbal)
‘He is educated’ (adjectival)
‘An educated man’ (adjectival attribute)If the resultative participle in an intransitive clause is from an atelic verb,
which by its nature does not express an event with an inherent resultant
state, only a verbal interpretation is possible. The participle does not function as an adjective expressing a state, as shown by the fact that it cannot
serve as an attributive adjectival modifier of the affected participant of the
event nor can it be combined with the adverbial heš ‘still’. Attested atelic
intransitive verbs include those classified as activities and statives.
Activity verbs include, for example, zmr ‘to sing’, bxy ‘to weep’, spr ‘to
wait’, plx ‘to work’:
(12) ""aw-náša hóle zmìra}
*naša zmira
(13) ""aw-náša hóle plìxa}
*naša plixa‘The man has sung’ (verbal)
‘The man has worked’ (verbal)the syntax of verbs657Punctual activities include such verbs as tp° ‘to sneeze’, m-tnx ‘to sigh’
(14) ""aw-náša hóle tpì°a}
*naša tpi°a
(15) ""aw-náša hóle mtùnxa}
*naša mtunxa‘The man has sneezed’
‘The man has sighed’Stative verbs include, for example, zd"" ‘to fear, be afraid’:
(16) ""aw-náša hóle zdìya}
*naša zdiya‘The man has feared’The resultative participle is combined with the copula also in the predicate
of transitive clauses, which contain an argument in addition to that of the
subject. In such constructions the participle always has a verbal interpretation. The participle and the copula agree with the subject, e.g.
(17) ""aw-náša hóle dwíqa bàxta.} ‘The man has seized a woman.’ (verbal)
Perfective transitive events are typically telic, in that they result in a state
which constitutes an inherent endpoint. The affected participant in the
event is generally the goal of the action, in (17) ‘a woman’, rather than
the subject referent. A resultative participle can only be used adjectivally
when it is a predicative or attributive adjective of the affected participant
of a telic event. It follows that the participle can be used adjectivally in
a passive construction such as (18), in which the affectee of the event is
subject. This is shown by the fact that it can be combined with the adverb
heš ‘still’, which can only be used in relation to states, e.g.
(18) ""ay-báxta hóla dwìqta}
‘The woman is seized’ (adjectival)
""ay-báxta héš hóla dwìqta} ‘The woman is still seized’ (adjectival)
""ay-baxta dwiqta
‘The seized woman’ (attributive adjective)
Such passive constructions can also have a perfective verbal interpretation, e.g.
(19) ""ay-báxta hóla dwìqta}‘The woman has been seized’658chapter fifteenThe agent is optionally expressed in a phrase introduced by the preposition l- or m6n. This can be used both when the participle has a verbal
interpretation and also when it is adjectival, e.g.
(20) ""aw-qðíla hóle mtúrßa l-baznàye} ‘The key has been made by Baz
people’ (verbal)
""aw-qðíla hóle mtúrßa l-baznàye} ‘The key is made by Baz people’
(adjectival)
qðila mturßa l-baznaye ‘A key made by Baz people’ (adjectival attribute)
In transitive clauses such as (17) the resultative participle and the copula
agree grammatically with the subject of the clause, which refers to the
agent, rather than the object, which refers to the affectee, so only a verbal interpretation is possible. Furthermore, the grammatical agreement
with the subject, which is the agent of the event, forces the participle to
be interpreted with an active rather than passive voice. This active interpretation is further demonstrated by the fact that pronominal objects are
expressed by attaching L-suffixes, which are used elsewhere to express the
pronominal object of active verbs, e.g.
(21) ""aw-náša hóle dwìq6lla} ‘The man has seized her’
cf. ""aw-náša b-dawêqla} ‘The man will seize her’
The behaviour of the resultative participle in the various structural configurations discussed above may be summarized in the table below:Intransitive telic
Intransitive atelic
Transitive active
Transitive passiveFunctionGrammatical agreementVerbal/adjectival
Verbal
Verbal
Verbal/adjectivalGrammatical subject
Grammatical subject
Grammatical subject
Grammatical subjectThe following historical development of the construction may be hypothesized. The resultative participle was originally an adjectival form qualifying the affectee of an event, denoting the resultant state of the affectee
in a telic intransitive event or a transitive event. When used predicatively
an ambiguity developed between the interpretation of the function of the
construction as the expression of the resultant stative property (adjecti-the syntax of verbs659val) or the verbal event that brought about the state (verbal). The verbal
interpretation was extended by analogy to intransitive atelic predicates,
which do not result in any state and could not by themselves provide the
semantic basis required for the formation of the resultative participle. It
was also extended by analogy to transitive active predicates. The feature
of agreement with the grammatical subject was extended by analogy
from the original intransitive/passive construction to the transitive active
construction.
Regarding the copula component of constructions with the resultative
participle, this can be either the deictic copula or the basic copula. As
has been shown in §15.3.1.–§15.3.2., one of the conditioning factors for
selecting one particular type of copula is the nature of the predicate.
The enclitic basic copula and the deictic copula are used with predicates
expressing either contingent or permanent properties but the independent
basic copula is used only with predicates expressing permanent properties
that, typically, are intrinsic to the nature of the subject referent and have
not been acquired. It follows that it is in principle not appropriate to use
the independent copula with the resultative participle, which, whether
adjectival or verbal, expresses an acquired property of the subject. There
are sporadic exceptions to this principle, such as (22), where the speaker
appears to have used the independent copula in order to present the
property of being betrothed as a permanent property of the woman in
question:
(22) l7ðeti ""àyya} t-íla m6n-hèš t-la-bràya} ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi?} bàxtila.}
‘Don’t you know that she has been betrothed to me since before
she was born? She is my wife.’ (A25:39)
15.4.1.2. Function in Non-Narrative Discourse
We shall now examine in greater detail the function that these resultative
constructions have when used verbally.
It is important to make a distinction between its usage in narrative texts
and its usage in non-narrative discourse.
In non-narrative discourse the resultative form is used to denote the
result of a past verbal event that is in existence in the present. It is generally appropriate to translate it with the English present perfect. The deictic
copula is used with the participle to draw particular attention to a current situation. There is a certain amount of subjectivity in the use of
the deictic copula, but it is generally employed in assertive clauses to
draw attention to a resultant state that has some kind of relevance to the660chapter fifteenimmediate present moment in time, e.g. hole ""6°ya ‘He has come’. In interrogative clauses the enclitic copula is used, e.g. ""6°y5le? ‘Has he come?’ The
construction is negated in both assertions and questions by the negative
copula, e.g. l5le ""6°ya ‘He has not come’, l5le ""6°ya? ‘Has he not come’.
The expression hole ""6°ya ‘He has come’ denotes that the subject has the
property of ‘having come’, which is the result of a prior event of coming.
It asserts the existence in the present of the result of an event without
referring directly to any specific event that brought about this result.
Therefore, without further specification by a time adverbial in the clause
or by the discourse context, the statement hole ""6°ya denotes that he has the
property of ‘having come’ as a result of some unspecified event of coming
that occurred some time in the past. There is no restriction on when the
event occurred other than that it was some time before the present. The
q†ille form,6 by contrast, refers directly to a specific event in the past and
not to its result. The event has typically occurred in the recent past and
this may extend up to the present moment. The expression dìya °éle} ‘He
has come just now’ would be used to assert the occurrence of a specific
event that has just taken place. Likewise the q†ilwale form °ewale denotes
the occurrence of a specific event in the more remote past.
It may be the case that the result of the actions of q†ille and q†ilwale
have some kind of relevance in the present. This is especially the case
with regard to q†ille, which, in conversational discourse, is often translated
most appropriately with the English ‘perfect of recent past’.7 Such resultant present relevance is, however, an implicature of their use rather than
a component of their meaning. As remarked, the endpoint of an event
expressed by q†ille may be the present moment. The q†ille form °ele ‘He
has come’ would be used by a speaker when he sees a person walking
through the door of his home and the greeting said to the visitor on his
arrival would be b-šˆna °élux!} ‘You have come in peace!’ The resultative
form refers to a resultant state that holds at a period that is not adjacent
temporally with the endpoint of the event. The resultant state is disconnected from the event temporally in that the resultative form is typically
used after some time has elapsed after the event, crucially when none of
the event can be witnessed directly. The resultative form hole ""6°ya ‘He has
come’, for example, would be used when a guest is sitting in the house
6
For the sake of conciseness we shall dispense with noting in all cases the fact that the
q6m-qa†6l and q6m-qa†6lwa forms are suppletive variants of transitive perfective q†ille and
q†ilwale forms when pronominal suffixes are added.

"934chapter eighteen18.2.1. Negated Interrogative Clauses Expressing Preliminary Background Material
A negated clause that is pronounced with intonation patterns related to
those of questions (§18.5.3.) is sometimes used to signal that the situation
described in the clause should be taken as the grounds for what follows.
The construction is a device to draw attention to the clause, in order to
set it up as a boundary in the discourse, acting as the onset of a new
section. It is most commonly used to express temporal background. This
may express a situation that overlaps temporally with the following main
event (1–2) or a preceding event that marks its onset (3–6):
(1) ""ánna l7la dmìxe,} ""o-rább6n mútt6lla ""áqle díye rš-8q6l bàxta.} ‘While they

the nails, the nail ate the gold, took some of the gold.’ (A14:28)
(6) ""áyya másta la-q6m-daríla gu-d-aw-gùða,} . . . heš-t-là bráza,} xán‘i t-la-bráza
m5°íwa xa-g•lla y-amríle sêrmo.} ‘When they have put the yoghurt in the
churn . . . while it is not yet dry, shortly before it becomes dry, they
would fetch a herb called s6rmo.’ (B14:1)
Occasionally the construction is used to express the causal grounds for
the situation described in what follows, e.g.
(7) dúk°6 d-ó-g6ld6t tàwra,} l5le-wíða g•dda zòra,} xzi-k6má m>sà˙a dwíqle.}
‘Since he had made it into a fine thread, the place (enclosed by) the
ox skin covered a great area.’ (A11:13)
On sporadic occasions the negative construction expresses the background
of a preceding rather than following clause, e.g.","[972, 973]"
"the syntax of verbs731(8)""áyya y-amríla mandòrta,} yá'ni mandrále gàre} . . . qa-t-lá-ßala dalòpe.}
""u-b-sêtwa} ""í°ena ""íma t-y-á°e ""6ryàna} ""áy mandòre mánd6ri.} ‘They call
this a roller, that is it rolls the roof . . . so that leaking water does
seep down (into the house). In the winter, when it rains, they would
roll it.’ (B5:193–194)
(9) qayèmwa báb6t xêtna,} dawèqwala ""íð6 báb6 k yàlo.} ya'ni dwáqa dawèqwa
""íð6-dìye} qá-t ""ó-m6ndi wèle.} ‘The father of the groom would rise
and shake the hand of the father of the bride. He would shake
his hand (to confirm) that this has taken place.’ (B5:10)
(10) tre-šabbá°a qam-dána ‘ˆdi.} y-ázi ma°wà°a,} ‘yàda ‘5díwa.} ‘Two weeks
beforehand they would invite (people). They would go to the villages and make invitations.’ (B5:20)
(11) har-t-ór6n làxxa.} q†ála har-qa†lìli.} t-árq6n b-o-k6ndála hár qa†lìli.} ‘I shall
go in here. They will kill me. If I run down the slope, they will
kill me.’ (B9:4)
The construction is used as an intensifier to express the extensive or farreaching nature of the action, e.g.
(12) ""ána zála har-zíl6n bìya} ‘I have absolutely gone with it! (i.e. I am
finished!)’ (A14:25)
(13) ma†réwa ma†róye x5làna.} ‘He was riding hard.’ (A8:39)
In (14) it is used to express the slow drawing out of the action:
(14) šqílta réše mattóye mtút6lle l-9ra.} ‘She took his head and slowly put it
on the ground.’ (A13:12)
In (15) and (16) the cognate infinitive is used to give prominence to the
descriptive content of the action of the verb:
(15) kút-xa y-amrèxxe yá'ni ""6n-íle náša spày,} ""ó-yoma basímta t-óya šêmša.}
xàðexi.} ""ó-yoma hàtxa yá'ni} y-amrèxla màra.} ‘We would say to each
person, if he was a good man, that on that day the sun will shine.
We were having fun. It was like that on that day, we would just
say such things (but not really mean it).’ (B5:150–151)
(16) ""áy lˆwa zwána zwán6lla.} ‘They were not really buying it.’ (B15:68)732chapter fifteenIn (17) the construction is used to make a forceful assertion to dispel the
doubt of a question posed by the interlocutor:
(17) zaqrituwa? zqára ""i-zaqrèxwa ""àxni,} hè.} ‘Did you knit? We indeed used
to knit, yes.’ (B10:46)
In the foregoing examples the cognate infinitive is the same stem as the
finite verb. In (18), by contrast, a stem I infinitive is combined with a stem
II verb. The stem II verb (m-brz ‘to dry’) is transitive whereas the stem I
form (brz I ‘to become dry’) is intransitive. The infinitive, therefore, does
not simply intensify the verb but expresses a telic outcome ‘they dry the
rice so that it becomes dry’, i.e. ‘they dried the rice out’:
(18) bar-hád6x rèzza mbárzi bràza.} masqíwale gàre,} masqíwa gàr-t bˆ°a.}
mpa°ˆwale.} barèzwa tàza.} ‘After that they dry the rice out. They
would take it up to the roof, take it up to the roof of the house.
They spread it out. It became thoroughly dry.’ (B5:88)
15.5.4. Purpose
On some occasions an infinitive is used to extend the description of an
action in a preceding clause by denoting the purpose of the action rather
than an action that actually takes place during its time interval. This is
particularly common after verbs expressing movement, taking and fetching, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)(6)Zíne zílla dwáq6lla prìxla.} ‘Zine went to grab it, (but) it flew off.’
(A25:72)
y-azíwa baxtá°a yàda.} ‘The women would go to weed.’ (B5:78)
kùt-yum} ßaléwa gàw‰a} l-šùqa} msawòqe.} ‘Every day the man would
go down to the market to do shopping.’ (A22:1)
""áp-""aw qím5le šqíl6lle tàwra} ßêly5le} mzabòn6lle.} ‘So, he took the ox
and went down to sell it.’ (A22:2)
mèra lá-dri x7l6t gànux.} ""ána °í°6n mpal†ánnux m-gu-sêj6n.} mère lát-°i°a
""ána mpaló†6lli m-gu-sêj6n.} °í°6t šqála ""áyya róxi m6n-gu-gàni.} ‘She said
“Do not struggle. I have come to bring you out of the prison.”
He said “You have not come to bring me out of the prison. You
have come to take my spirit from me.” ’ (A26:82)
""áy kút-yom mpal†áwala m>‰òy6lla.} ‘She took them out every day to
pasture them.’ (A34:20)the syntax of verbs733(7) ""ána šqìl6nne} ""áwwa qa†íya mxáya ""èlle dìye.} ‘I took this stick to strike at
it.’ (A29:23)
15.5.5. Complement of Verbs
The infinitive is used in the complement of verbs of perception, in which
it expresses the action of the referent that is perceived. The perceived
referent may be placed directly after the verb or is introduced by the
presentative particle ""ina, e.g.
(1) xzélux xa-náša °àya.} ‘You saw a man coming.’ (A22:22)
(2) wírre k6slèy} xírre mtúle bàla} kút-xa m6nnèy} réše m†áya l-†ùra.} ‘When he
went in to meet them, he looked and noticed that the head of each
of them reached the (top of ) the mountain.’ (A39:5)
(3) qím5le plì†a} xèzya ""ína b7°6t Qára Té≥din qàða.} ‘He went out and saw
that the house of Qara Te≥din was burning.’ (A26:53)
Object agreement pronouns on the verb, as in (4), indicate that the
perceived item is raised into the matrix clause when there is no ""ina
particle:
(4) là hummènne.} ha-t-xazèla} bráta °àya.} ‘He did not believe it, until he
saw the girl coming.’ (A26:79)
The verb of perception may be omitted with only the presentative particle
being used, e.g.
(5) mátti bála gu-yàma,} ""ìna} ""a-súst6t yamà°a} nabòl6lla} ’6lk9ze.} ‘They looked
at the sea and saw the mare of the seas taking away ’6lk>ze.’
(A12:34)
The infinitive is also used as the complement of various other verbs
including those having the sense of ‘beginning’, ‘learning’, ‘being busy’
and the irregular verb kyaza ‘to try’, e.g.
(6) šúryela m†awóle b-š6tr6njàne.} ‘They started to play chess.’ (A26:63)
(7) šurèla} jnàna} ""u-bxàya} ""u-mßawóre †la-xóna-w Bakùrko.} ‘She began to
lament, weep and curse her brother and Bakurko.’ (A26:83)
(8) šuréle là-draya bála l-s6tr6njàne.} šuréle gašòqe} b-Zìne.} ‘He began not to
pay attention to the chess. He began to look at Zine.’ (A26:66)734chapter fifteen(9)""u-táwra píšle mangóle ""áxxa l-tàmma.} ‘The ox began to limp back and
forth.’ (A22:3)
(10) píšt5la mtanóye ða-qêßß6t} †la-qà†u.} ‘She started to tell a story to the
cat.’ (A14:2)
(11) qímla zrá""a xabùše.} ‘They began to cultivate apples.’ (B5:75)
(12) ""áy hár-lipla dmàxa} ""u-xàla.} ‘She learnt only how to sleep and to
eat.’ (A21:1)
(13) m-táma hòd6x} kúlla ""an-""árba yàrxe,} xámša yàrxe,} y-áw5 náše blíge mj>mòye,}
mj>móye qa-sêtwa.} ‘From this time onwards, throughout four or
five months, people are busy gathering, gathering for winter.’
(B5:107)
(14) kízle qràya.} ‘He tried calling.’ (A48:5)
(15) kízle mxàya} goyá°6t sùsa,} súsa la-jwìjle.} ‘He tried to strike the sides
of the horse, but the horse did not move.’ (A28:33)
(16) kazíwa prám6lla har-pal†ìwa.} ‘They tried to cut them down, but they
kept growing up.’ (A38:15)
Past forms of the verb šry II ‘to begin’ may also be followed by a finite
verb rather than an infinitive, e.g.
(17) šuréle zmírre b-súsa smòqa.} ‘He started singing to a brown horse.’
(A25:11)
(18) šuréla xrì†la.} ‘She started to gouge it out.’ (A19:6)
(19) šúryela xílela m-©ðàðe.} ‘They began to eat together.’ (A21:21)
(20) šuréle ta-t-""àx6l.} ‘He began to eat’ (A21:12)
15.5.6. Complement of a Noun
On some occasions the infinitive is the complement of a noun, e.g.
(1)""í°wa rába ""urxá°a m†awòle.} ‘There were many ways to play.’ (B15:5)15.5.7. Complement of an Adjective
(1)
(2)
(3)""áti mùdit har-blíga †lába m-alàha} ta-t-yawêllux.} ‘Why are always busy
asking God to give (things) to you.’ (A3:3)
l7la senáyi xzày6lle.} ‘It is not easy to see him.’
zám6tila wàð6lle.} ‘It is difficult to do it.’the syntax of verbs73515.5.8. Syntactic Position of a Nominal
The infinitive is attested in various syntactic positions that are normally
occupied by nominals. These include:
(i) The Subject of a Clause
(1) qráya zàm6t-ila.} ‘Reading is difficult.’
(2) mdaróye modìla?} ‘What is winnowing?’ (B5:97)
(3) ""á°ela myá°a ""up-""ày.} ‘Death comes upon also her.’ (A26:89)
(ii) The Complement of a Naming Expression, e.g.
(1) ""áwwa y-amrèxxe wáða h5rìke.} ‘We call this “making soft mud beds.” ’
(B5:76)
(2) y-amrèxxe mxáya bè""e.} yá'ni šmá†a bé""e xa-d-o-xˆna,} twàra.} ‘We call this
“striking eggs,” that is knocking eggs together and breaking them.’
(B5:58)
(iii) The Complement of a Preposition
(1) pláxa biš-spáyila m6n-dmàxa.} ‘Working is better than sleeping.’
(2) xa-béna xèzya ""è°y5le xa-xùwwe} ""ax-pràxa.} ‘Then he saw a snake come,
as if flying.’ (A14:31)
(3) máme díye t-wéwa max-q†àl6lle.} ‘His uncle who had almost killed him.’
(A25:70)
(4) ""ána mj>móye qˆse,} déwe blíge b-xmáre xàla.} ‘While I was collecting
wood, wolves were busy eating the asses.’ (A23:35)
(iv) The Complement of a Nominal in Annexation
(1) jawètt6t práma qˆse} ‘a chopper for cutting wood’ (A26:91)
(v) The Complement of the Existential Particle
(1) ""ína gu-d-5-dàna} har-""í° rqàða-w} zmàra-w} m5°óye štˆ°a,} ""àraq-u} xumlàna.}
‘At that time there is constantly dancing, singing, serving of drinks,
arak, and jollity.’ (B5:71)736chapter fifteenAlthough the infinitive in these constructions is in a syntactic slot appropriate for a nominal, the infinitive is still treated like a verb with regard
to its own internal complemetation. This is seen in (ii1), (ii2) and (iv1),
where the objects of the infinitives are juxtaposed (wáða h5rìke ‘making
soft mud beds’, mxáya bè""e ‘striking eggs’, šmá†a bé""e ‘knocking eggs’, práma
qˆse ‘cutting wood’) rather than the infinitive being connected to it by a
nominal annexation with the particle D. In (iii4), furthermore, the object
is fronted before the infinitive (b-xmáre xàla). Note also that when the infinitive functions as the subject of a clause, it is often construed as feminine
in gender (i1–2).
15.6. The Verbal Noun
The verbal noun, which is formed by adding the feminine ending to the
infinitive, in principle denotes a single occurrence of an activity (§10.5.2.2.)
and so is inherently perfective in aspect. It may also be used to refer to
an iterative activity by denoting a single representative occurrence of this
iterated situation.
15.6.1. The Nominal Nature of the Verbal Noun
The verbal noun is treated syntactically in most respects like other nouns.
It may be used in a clause in positions that are appropriate for nouns, such
as subject position (1–2) or the complement of a preposition (3–5):
(1) dán6t plí†la qyàmta.} šahárta qa-t-qyàmta pál†a.} ‘The time when the
resurrection has come. They keep vigil until the resurrection comes
out.’ (B5:54)
(2) bár parqáwa qyàmta.} ‘After the resurrection (ceremony) had finished . . .’
(B5:56)
(3) ""u-""áyya gu-dyà‰ta} mòdi wídla?} ‘What did she do on her return?’
(A19:4)
(4) ""6n-b>yèxwa tùma,} †la-mbašàlta,} kèf6nile.} ‘If we wanted (to use) garlic
for cooking, it was up to us.’ (B10:24)
(5) mhày6rri} b6d-taxmàntux.} ‘Help me with your thought (on this matter).’
(A21:2)
A nominal denoting the subject or object participant of the activity
expressed by the verbal noun must be combined with the verbal nounthe syntax of verbs737by nominal annexation. This differs from infinitives, which are treated as
verbs in this respect and have their participants juxtaposed. Examples:
(i) Subject
(1) qyámt6t màran} ‘the resurrection of our Lord’ (B5:55)
(2) gu-práqt6t ""aßêrta,} bar-prìqla,} m5°7wa juwàla.} ‘At the end of the evening,
after they finished, they would bring a sack.’ (B5:86)
(3) b-zòr-áa¬e} †la-mapláxt6t bˆ°a.} ‘It is scarcely enough for the household
to use.’ (B5:215)
(ii) Object
(1) xyápt6t xêtna} ‘the washing of the groom’ (B15:74)
(2) zrét6t rêzza} ‘the cultivating of rice’ (B5:76)
(3) palá††6t ""9raq} ‘the production of arak’ (B5:12)
(4) mtaráßt6t xèlya ‘the preparation of milk’ (B5:173)
(5) ""u-qaÄèxwa yóma qamáy6t ""èða,} baráxt6t ""éða xa-d-o-xèna.} ‘We would
spend the first day of the festival offering festival blessings to one
another.’ (B15:8)
15.6.2. Cognate Verbal Nouns
Verbal nouns are used with their cognate verbs in various contexts. It is
found in anaphoric expressions such as those in (1) and (2), which express
a perfective and iterative activity respectively:
(1) ""u-píš5le gu-d-5-pyàšta} há-t-ila °í°a ""ámte dìye.} ‘He remained in that
situation until his aunt came.’ (A23:7)
(2) ""u-""an-baxtà°a} kapšìwale,} napßíwale gu-d-a-npàßta} ""u-mattíwale l-qóma bá°6r
xàßey.} ‘The women would gather it and shake it with the shaking
( just mentioned) and put it into a pile behind their back.’ (B5:85)
Similar anaphoric constructions are used in which the finite verb occurs
in a preceding clause, e.g.
(3) mèra qú ßli-xzì!} . . . gu-d-7 ßl5°èy} qá†u wìrt5la.} ‘She said “Go down
and see!” While they were coming down (like this), a cat came in.’
(A4:52–53)738chapter fifteenA verbal noun is used with a cognate finite verb to express the intensity
of a single perfective action, e.g.
(4) °éle tálga xa-°ˆ°a.} ‘Snow came with a (great) coming’ (i.e. it snowed
heavily).’ (A25:41)
The use of a cognate verbal noun can be used to give additional morphological coding to a perfective event to mark a boundary in the discourse. This is the case with (5), in which the clause in question marks a
an episodic boundary:
(5) qlábta díya qlìbla} ""u-kúlle bêrya} y-amrèxxe xa-kerábso ‘She returned her
return (= When she returned) and it had all grown into (the plant)
we call kerabso.’ (A34:17)
15.6.3. The Verbal Noun Combined with the Verb ‘to be’
On some occasions the verbal noun is combined with the verb ‘to be’
following the model of compound verbal forms with the infinitive. This
construction expresses an iterative action, by presenting one representative
occurrence of the action. The compound infinitive construction can express
the same iterative sense (§15.4.2.4.). Examples from the text corpus:
(1) hár mkapášt6t kisyá°6t dàwela tóto.} ‘The old woman is all the time collecting bags of gold.’ (A4:22)
(2) rqàðt5la-w} xálta-w štˆ°5la.} ‘They are dancing, eating and drinking.’
(A14:46)
(3) warwàrt5la-w} ‘It (the bear) roars.’ (A27:29)
(4) maplàšt5w6lley} yèn mattèxwaley gu-ßàwle.} ‘They would knock them
together or we would put them in shoes.’ (B15:5)
(5) ""6n-t-áwe jwàjta,} b-šàx6n.} ‘If he moves (on one occasion), he warms
up.’ (B11:16)
Note that the verbal noun in (4) maplàšt5w6lley expresses the pronominal
object with an ""6ll- phrase.
In (6) a verbal noun construction is juxtaposed with an infinitive construction. The former can be interpreted as expressing the iterated single
events of the animal’s roaring and the latter as denoting a continuous
activity of singing:the syntax of verbs
(6)739""ay-wàðt5la} n>ra-n8ra dìya} ""u-""áw zmàr5le bíya.} ‘She is giving off her
roar and he is singing along with her.’ (A27:14)In (7), where the subject in the English translation is non-volitional, the
copula takes the verbal noun as its grammatical subject:
(7)qarqárte dìyela} ‘He made a squeaking noise (literally: there is his
squeaking).’ (A30:9)In (8) the form jnanya°a can be interpreted as the plural of the verbal noun
jnanta and, therefore, expresses a plurality of individual actions:
(8)qímela ""ê°ye.} ""7-bena ""áxxa kúlla jnanyà°5la.} ""7-ga zmár5la b-tábut dìye.}
‘They came and there they all lamented and sang (dirges) over his
coffin.’ (A26:83)
15.7. The Imperative FormIn most cases the imperative form is used perfectively to command the
performance of a single delimited action with a clear start and endpoint,
e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)prúmu rèše!} ‘Cut off his head!’ (A24:31)
hallúle ""álpa dàwe!} ‘Give him a thousand gold pieces!’ (A1:14)
šqúlla yalêx°a!} ‘Take the scarf !’ (A4:18)
diya-m7°u júlli malušùla!} ‘Now bring my clothes and put them on
(me)!’ (A4:20)
wúð ða-spayú°a mênni!} ‘Do me a favour!’ (A7:17)
háyyo ßlí K>r≈m ""áti gu-d-áwwa balù'a.} ‘Come Karim, go down into
this conduit!’ (A14:16)Prohibitions may be expressed by negating an imperative form by the
negative particle la. If this particle is combined with the verb in a stress
group it typically takes the stress, e.g.
(7) lá-wuð qàla!} ‘Do not make a noise!’ (A30:44)
(8) lá-mur hàtxa!} ‘Do not say that!’ (A26:52)
(9) bróni là q6†lúle!} ‘Do not kill my son!’ (A33:6)
(10) là maštóla míya} ‘Do not give them water to drink!’ (A25:9)740chapter fifteenOn some occasions the imperative is used to command or prohibit a less
clearly delimited action. In (11) and (12), for example, the imperatives
‘work!’ and ‘search!’ respectively clearly command the inception of the
action but do not necessarily imply an endpoint. In (13) the actions commanded by the imperatives are most easily interpreted as iterative. The
speaker is referring to the annual custom of Kurds to bring sheep into
the village during transhumance and intends his command to apply to
all future years.
(11) xuš-plùx6n!} ta-mú-t ba†íla tíwa gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Go and work! Why are you
sitting idly in the house?’ (A39:1)
(12) †ó-l5xu xa-šúla ta-t-x8yitu bìye!} ‘Search for a job for yourselves by
which you may make a living!’ (A30:1)
(13) lá-masqu l-gár6t ""ùmra!} m-gu-gár6t ""úmra hóla náblula t>máha rê˙qa!}
†la-mótu m5°óy6lla gár6t ""ùmra?} ‘Don’t take them onto the roof. Take
them far away from the roof of the church. Why do you bring
them on the roof of the church?’ (B18:7)
In (14) and (15) the imperatives are negated by the particle bassa ‘enough!’
and command the end of an activity that is already in progress without
any implied starting point:
(14) bássa bxˆg6n} bássa wuð-tàzi.} ‘Do not weep any more! Do not mourn
any more!’ (A26:88)
(15) bássa ští ""u-rwì!} ‘Don’t drink any more and get any more drunk!’
On numerous occasions the imperative is preceded by the particle of
immediacy d6-/de-. Most attested examples are positive commands, e.g.
(16) d6-šqúl ""anna-zùze!} ‘Take these coins!’ (A1:27)
(17) d6-šùqla!} ‘Leave it!’ (A5:7)
(18) de-mùrri!} ‘Tell me!’ (A4:26)
(19) de-wúr gu-d-áwwa gùrba!} ‘Go into this torso!’ (A14:67)
The particle may be placed before an adverb of immediate time reference, such as ‘today’ in (20):
(20) de-""êdyo,} qu-p7g6n kàde!} ‘Today, get up and bake kade cakes!’
(A30:41)the syntax of verbs741In (21) the particle is placed before a 2nd person pronoun:
(21) d6-""áti xùš!} ‘You go!’ (A39:1)
As has been discussed in §15.1.1.5., also the 2nd person of the qa†6l form
can be used deontically to express commands or prohibitions. This may
be used perfectively to express single delimited actions, e.g.
(22) súsux b8ye t-kàle.} là-šoq6t t-kále.} máx6t ""èlle díye ta-t-""ás6q pày6dle ""o-†úra.}
‘Your horse will want to stop. Do not let him stop. Strike him so
that he will go up and cross over that mountain.’ (A24:11)
(23) xazètla t6rtè bná°a} t-á°i m7°i qàhwa.} là-šaql6tle qáhwa mènna.} maxètle
s7pux ""6l-qðalèy} p5rmêtle rešéy.} ‘You will see two girls, who will
come and bring coffee. Do not accept the coffee from them. You
should strike your sword into their neck and cut off their head.’
(A24:13)
(24) ""áz6t táwrux p5rmêtle.} ‘You should go and slaughter your ox.’
(A7:2)
It may also be used imperfectively to express general commands or prohibitions that are not delimited to a single action, e.g.
(25) hàtxa ""oðéti b-náše!} ‘This is what you should do to people!’ (A22:47)
(26) là-qabl6t} là b6‰-náša t-áw6r gáwa} ""u-là h7w6n.} ‘Don’t allow any person
or animal to enter it.’ (A23:18)
(27) là maßí°6t} ""àni} sa†anyà°5la} ‘Don’t listen (to such things), they are
little demons.’ (A26:11)
The distinction between the imperative form and the deontic qa†6l form,
therefore, is not primarily one of aspect, although this may have some
bearing on the choice between the two. The main factor is rather the
communicative profile of the command. In principle a speaker uses the
imperative when he wishes to give the command a high degree of salience.
The deontic qa†6l form is used when it has a lesser degree of salience.
Various features contribute to this salience. One feature is immediacy. All
other things being equal, an imperative expresses the will of the speaker
for an action to be performed closer to the present moment than the qa†6l
form. Consider, for example, the pair of constructions (28) and (29), both
of which are perfective in aspect. In (28) the speaker invites the addressee742chapter fifteento come immediately and join him swimming. In (29) the request relates
to an action of coming at a point further in the future:
(28) ""ána hon-sxáya gàwa.} b8y6t t-á°y6t sàxy6t?} d6-háyyo sxà!} ‘I am swimming in it. Do you want to swim? Come and swim!’ (A25:61)
(29) yóm6t †¬à°a,} ""á°6t k6slˆni.} ‘In three days time come to us.’ (A22:17)
It is relevant to note that the particle of immediacy d6-/de-, which is
commonly used with imperatives but only sporadically with deontic qa†6l,
is likely to be related etymologically to the adverbial diya ‘now’. In some
NENA dialects it is used in progressive contructions that express actions
that are taking place at the present moment (e.g. C. Ankawa d6-k-šat6n ‘I
am drinking’).
As we have seen in (11) and (12), the action commanded by an imperative may extend indefinitely into the future. In (14) the action has no
definite starting point. The relevant feature in all these cases is that the
speaker commands the action to begin or end immediately.
The use of the imperative to express the command of iterative actions
cannot be motivated by temporal immediacy. The salience of the command
arises from its high degree of force, which is greater than in corresponding
iterative deontic expressions with qa†6l forms such as (30):
(30) kút-yom pál†6t ""u-xàðr6t,} ""áß6rta ""á°6t bˆ°a.} ‘Every day go out and wander about and then in the evening come back home.’ (A14:62)
Another feature that contributes to salience appears to be the positiveness
of the command. All other things being equal, there is a greater tendency
to use the deontic qa†6l form with a negative command than with a positive one, as reflected in (31) and (32), in which positive commands and
prohibitions with perfective aspect referring to immediate actions are
used side by side:
(31) mèra hàyyo,} hàyyo!} madam-t-íw6t ""àti,} hàyyo!} là-""az6t.} ‘Come, come.
Since it is you, come, don’t go!’ (A24:36)
(32) ""áti là pálx6t.} ""áti tù.} ""àna pálx6n.} ‘Don’t you work. You sit down. I
shall work.’ (A21:23)
Indeed, in some NENA dialects, such as C. Qaraqosh, negative commands can only be expressed by negating the qa†6l form (cf. Khan 2002:
351). In C. Barwar, as in many other NENA dialects, negation has beenthe syntax of verbs743extended to imperative forms, but the distribution of negated commands
is still less than that of positive commands on account of the inherently
lower degree of salience of a negated command. The fact that the particle
d6-/de-, which gives added salience to a command, is largely restricted
to positive commands may also be a reflection of this inherently lower
salience of negated commands.
All the uses of the imperative described above can be reconciled with
the claim that the form is perfective. As already remarked, cases such as
(11), (12) and (14) can be regarded as having an ingressive or terminative sense, which are features exhibited by other perfective forms. The
occurrence of the imperative in iterative expressions can be explained as
being the use of a perfective form appropriate to command an individual
occurrence of the iterated action to command, by implication, the iterated action as a whole. It is relevant to note that in (13) the speaker uses
in an adjacent clause the compound infinitive construction to refer to an
iterative action (†la-mótu m5°óy6lla gár6t ""ùmra?} ‘Why do you bring them
on the roof of the church?’). As we have seen (§15.4.2.4.), the use of the
infinitive construction to express an iterative action is an extension of its
use to express a perfective narrative present. It can be said that the basic
perfectivity of the form, which gives the commanded action delimited
boundaries, results in its salience and it is this perfectivity that gives the
sense of greater force in the command. The deontic qa†6l form, on the
other hand, may express either perfective or imperfective aspect. We may
summarize the features contributing to the salience in imperative forms in
the scales below, in which the symbol > should be read as ‘more salient
than’. All other things being equal, a command with the features on the
lefthand side of the scales would be more likely to be expressed by an
imperative than those with the features on the righthand side:
Perfective
Positive
Immediate>
>
>Imperfective
Negative
Non-immediateThe imperative may be extended by a variety of suffixes (§8.6.5.). Informants feel that these add additional force to the command like the prefixed
particle d6-/de-. In the text corpus they are attested only with positive commands, which is likely to be a reflection of the inherently lower salience of
the negative commands. Another factor that determines the distribution
of the imperative forms with added suffixes is their position within a section of discourse. When there are two or more imperatives in a sequence,744chapter fifteenforms with added suffixes tend to be placed at the end of the sequence.
The heavy morphological coding of the forms is used in such contexts to
mark a final boundary of a discourse unit. The sequence may consist of
two or more different imperatives in a closely knit unit as in (33–35) or
the repetition of the same imperative as in (36) and (37), e.g.
(33) dú‰u sógena k6s-babàxu.} ‘Return, go to your father.’ (A14:85)
(34) xuš-plùx6n!} ‘Go and work!’ (A39:1)
(35) qu-p7g6n kàde} ‘Get up and bake kade cakes.’ (A30:41)
(36) sí-mur ta-pèll6n waz‰r} múrgena málka °èle.} ‘Go and say to the minister
so-and-so, say the king has come back.’ (A4:33)
(37) xùl!} dàn5la.} qìrra.} xùlena!} ‘Eat! It is time. It has got cold. Eat!’
(B5:34)
In a few cases the imperative is used in narrative as a substitute for a
perfective narrative verbal form. These are addressed to the person
performing the action and are typically used when there is a transition
between spatial locations that involves a verb of movement. The clause
containing the imperative may open with a 3rd person subject pronoun
as in (38) and (39):
(38) qímt5la zìlta,} mu°7°6lla qußárta dìya.} ""a-zórta muttá°6lla gu-d-7 qußárt6t
šwàwe} ""u-nubàlt6lla.} hadìya,} ""áw qu-šqúlla qußàrta-w} sí be-šwàwux.}
šláma-ll5xu šwàwe.} ‘She went and brought her cooking pot. She put
the small one in the cooking pot of the neighbours and took it (to
her husband). Now, he—get up and take the cooking pot and go
to the house of your neighbour! “Greeings to you neighbours.” ’
(A5:4)
(39) qáy6m yawèlle ""álpa dáwe xène.} ""áw xá-reša m-táma qú-si l-bˆ°a.} ""áp
""an-tre-""álpe dáwe xéne mˆ°ila.} ""u-háyyo šláma-llux xóni xùwwe!} ‘He
gives him another thousand gold pieces. He—directly from there
get up and go home. Bring back also those two thousand pieces
of gold and come back “Greetings my brother snake! Peace and
blessings!” ’ (A1:19–20)
Example (40) illustrates the use of an imperative for another type of narrative strategy. The negated imperative of the verb to say lá-mur ‘Do not
say!’, which is presumably addressed to the hearer of the narrative, has
the function of drawing special attention to what follows.","[769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 778, 779, 780, 781, 782, 783]"
"the syntax of verbs625(21) ""ána spày-iw6n.} ‘I am good.’
(22) ""áti spày-iw6t.} ‘You are good.’
It can be seen, therefore, that the construction in which the enclitic copula
is attached to the predicate is used irrespective of the topicality of the
subject nominal.
The construction is also unmarked with regard to the communicative
salience of the proposition of the clause as a whole. This is reflected by
its usage irrespective of the factivity of the proposition. It is used both
in factive and non-factive propositions. Clauses expressing assertive, factive propositions are high in communicative salience in that the speaker
is committed to its factuality. Non-factive propositions do not involve
such commitment and are low in communicative salience. This applies,
for example, to interrogative clauses, in which the proposition is being
questioned, e.g.
(23) bróne díye spày-ile} ‘His son is good’
(24) bróne díye spày-ile?} ‘Is his son good?’
The present enclitic copula sometimes has a past tense reference in clauses
that are syntactically subordinated to or closely associated with a clause
with a past verb form, e.g.
(25) Fárxo mêre} ""áp-""ana m†ál6n m6nnˆxu.} zòr5le.} ‘Farxo said “I also shall
play with you.” He was young.’ (A25:87)
(26) ""u-""5-Lelí°a °èla.} ""áy kúlla dòn5la,} dòna,} mêšxa.} ""ína °éla l-t9ra.} ‘The
Leli°a came. She was all (made of) fat, fat, oil. She came to the
door.’ (A19:4)
(27) ßlèla,} tfíqla mu'àll6m.} mu'àll6m,} d6kkána gò‰t5la.} ‘She went down
and met the teacher. The teacher—the shop (he was in) was big.’
(A22:18)
(28) qìmt5la} wíðt6lle ""ixàla,} bè""e.} qèdamt5la.} ‘She made him food, some
eggs. It was early morning.’ (A23:4)
15.3.1.2. The Independent Basic Copula
The independent basic copula is marked with regard to the nature of the
predicate and subject and also with regard to the communicative salience
of the proposition expressed by the clause.
There are restrictions with regard to the type of predicate and subject
that occur in this construction. The predicate is identificatory or expresses626chapter fifteena permanent property of the subject, which is typically an intrinsic defining property rather than an acquired property. It is not used when the
predicate denotes a contingent situation. The subject of the construction
is always high in topicality. There is no restriction, however, regarding the
referential status of the subject, in that it may have a specific referent or
denote a generic class. This is illustrated in the following examples,
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl.’ (A29:63)
""ána ""íw6n Yúw6l Yu˙ànna.} ‘I am Yuw6l Yu˙anna.’ (A1:1)
""áxni ""íw6x màlke.} ‘We are kings.’ (A18:8)
""áwwa ""íle sulàqa.} ‘This is the (festival of) Ascension.’ (B6:7)
b7°6t Qára Té≥din qìdle.} Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} ‘The house of
Qara Te≥din has burnt down. Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law.’
(A26:55)
(6) ""í°wal6n ßàwma,} yá'ni ""éða y-a°éwa m6n-ßàwma.} ßáwma ""íle xamšì yomá°a.}
‘We had a fast, that is the festival came after a fast. The fast is fifty
days.’ (B5:52)
(7) ""áxxa ""í°ena dàwla.} dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.}
‘Here there is a drum. The drum is a box, with an open top, in
which they put wheat.’ (B6:54)
(8) °áy5le qàša} ""u-sá‰a gnùn5le.} ""ó gnúna ""íle nišànqa.} ‘The priest comes
and ties the band. The band is a symbol.’ (B5:44)
(9) ""u-kùt-xa} ""ítle góm6t g yàne,} ""ítle dúka mruzágta y-amrèxla dùna.} . . . góma
""íle gawàye,} dúna ""íle qam-t9ra.} ‘Everybody has his own basement
stable and a place prepared (for feeding), which we call a duna
(feeding pen). . . . The basement stable is inside and the feeding
pen is outside.’ (B5:110)
(10) xàr°a} y-a°él5ni ""èða} ""éð6t be-yàlda.} ""éð6t be-yálda ""íle w7°6t Mšìxa.} ‘Then
we have (another) festival, the festival of Christmas. The festival of
Christmas is (in commemoration of) the birth of Christ.’ (B6:12)
The high topicality of the subject item in (4)–(10) arises from the fact that
its referent has been referred to in the immediately preceding discourse,
where it is an item of central concern. In the case of full nominal subjects, moreover, the nominal itself has typically been mentioned in the
preceding clause, as can be seen in the examples. Constructions such as
(1)–(3) with 1st person pronominal subjects, however, often occur at the
beginning of speech. One factor contributing to the high topicality of the
subject referent could be that the referent of the pronoun is present and
observable by the hearer in the speech situation. Another factor is thatthe syntax of verbs627such clauses are typically used at the beginning of a speech in which the
first person referent plays a prominent role in the subsequent clauses. We
may call this forward pointing topicality. This is the case, for example,
with the discourse following the clause adduced in (1) above, which is
reproduced below:
(11) ""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo,} . . . hon-""è°ya †láb6lla bràtux,} nablènna
†la-bàbi.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl . . . I have come seeking the hand
of your daughter, in order to take her to my father.’ (A29:63)
A construction with an independent copula is marked with regard to
communicative salience. It is used in clauses expressing assertive, factive
propositions, which are high in communicative salience in that the speaker
is committed to their factuality, but it is not used to express non-factive
propositions such as interrogative clauses, in which the proposition is
being questioned. If the clause is interrogative, the enclitic copula on the
predicate is used. This is illustrated in (12), which contains assertive and
interrogative clauses:
(12) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle †¬a°ì-yome.} ""áxtu šab°7xu
""6štà-yomela?} yarx7xu ""6sri-w-""6óóà-yomele?} ‘A week for us is seven days
and a month is thirty days. Is your week six weeks? Is your month
twenty-nine days?’ (A17:13)
The communicative salience of the construction gives the clause a degree
of independence from the preceding discourse. This is often exploited to
express some kind of reorientation in the discourse. When the subject is
a 3rd person pronoun or a nominal that has been mentioned in the preceding discourse, the construction is generally used to express some kind
of elaborative background on what precedes. It can be seen as a device
to mark a boundary or discontinuity in the flow of the discourse. This is
a common discourse usage of contructions with communicative salience.
Alternatively communicative salience of the construction is sometimes
exploited to give prominence to a statement deemed to be of particular
importance. This applies especially to clauses with a 1st or 2nd person
pronominal subject (1–3). These often occur at the beginning of a section
of discourse.
When the subject of the independent copula is pronominal, in some
cases it is expressed only by the inflection of the copula and is not realized by an independent pronoun, e.g.","[663, 664, 665, 666]"
"CHAPTER FIFTEENTHE SYNTAX OF VERBS
15.1. The Function of the Verbal Forms Derived from the
Present Base
The verbal forms are categorized here according to their structure. The
stem I root q†l ‘to kill’ is used to illustrate these. The forms derived from
this root given below will be used as general labels to designate all variations and inflections of forms that fall within the category. The label ‘qa†6l
form’, for example, will be used to designate all verb forms that consist
of the present base without prefixed or suffixed particles, including not
only stem I verbs with strong consonants, such as gar6š ‘He pulls’, ßar6x
‘He shouts’, etc., but also stem II, stem III and quadriliteral verbs as well
as all weak and irregular verbs, e.g. mšad6r ‘He sends, mapl6x ‘He uses’,
mkank6š ‘He drags’, qay6m ‘He rises’, xaze ‘He sees’, mšare ‘He begins’, maßle
‘He brings down’, m‘aw‘e ‘He twitters’, etc.
When discussing the function of forms derived from the present base
qa†6l-, a distinction must be made between verbs with an initial laryngal
/ ""/ and verbs with an initial strong radical. The reason for this is that the
distribution of preverbal particles such as ""i- and b6d- on initial /""/ verbs
is different from their distribution on verbs with a strong initial radical.
Initial / ""/ verbs are in general consistent and conservative in their use of
the particles whereas in verbs with initial strong consonants the particles
are frequently elided. The divergent distribution of the prefixed particles
in the two groups of verbs has arisen from differences in phonetic structure rather than any semantic distinction. The crucial difference, it would
seem, is that in initial /""/ verbs the particle normally replaces the / ""/
and becomes the onset of the first syllable of the word, e.g. ""i + ""az6l >
y-az6l ‘He goes’, b6d + ""az6l > t-az6l ‘He will go’. Since the particle is the
onset of the syllable, it is protected from elision. Another factor is that
the number of syllables in the form has not been increased. When the
particles are attached to a verb with an initial strong consonant, on the
other hand, they constitute a separate syllable, adding to the morphological weight of the form. In this environment they have become more
vulnerable to elision. In the description of the function of forms derived570chapter fifteenfrom the present base, therefore, these two groups of verbs will be treated
separately. Initial /""/ verbs will be designated as group A and other verbs
as group B. Since group A is the more conservative one with regard to
the preverbal particles, the main classification of functions will be based
on the distribution of the particles in verbal forms from this group.
15.1.1. qa†6l
The form qa†6l has a wide range of functions. These include the expression
of both realis and irrealis. It can be regarded as the default, unmarked
form in relation to the forms with prefixed particles such ""i-qa†6l and b6dqa†6l, which have more specific functions.
15.1.1.1. Narrative Present (Realis)
One realis function of the qa†6l form is to denote foreground events in
a narrative. These express a perfective aspect and present the actions as
punctual events with their deictic temporal centre in the present. They
should not be interpreted as expressing imperfective progressive aspect,
which is a function that is in principle not expressed by the qa†6l form.
Examples from groups A and B:
(1) ßàlya,} ""ap-xa-xéta ""axlàla.} ‘She goes down and eats also another one.’
(A18:21)
(2) ""u-""áyya zènjir ""áwra ""ánna waríð6t qðàle,} kasxàla} ""u-nàp6l.} ‘The chain
goes into the veins of his neck and cuts them. He falls down.’
(A26:81)
(3) ""áwwa bíye b6-b-sùse} ""áw6r gu-xa-gêppa.} ‘He together with his horse
enters a cave.’ (A28:3)
(4) ""àz6l,} ""àz6l,} ""àz6l,} ""u-mà†e,} má†e l-‘ádr6t bábe dìye.} ‘He goes, goes and
goes and arrives, arrives at the tent of his father.’ (A28:33)
(5) yátu l-xáß6t daw7ra,} ""áp-""aw ""àz6l.} ""áz6l di-di-dì} †apéle xále dìye} gu-d-àyma°a.} ‘He sits on the back of a mule and he also sets off. He goes
along and catches up with his uncle in that village.’ (A28:11)
(6) m6n-lèbbe díye qìða,} d7re xˆla,} na‘êlle ""o-š6ryóxa.} ""u-""á°e šaqèlla xa-""áqr6t
bê†ma.} šaqêlla} ""u-šamê†la} taqàne.} ‘Out of his fervour, he applies force
and pulls the tether apart. He goes and takes the stock of a terebinth
tree. He takes it and breaks off the branches.’ (A28:20)
(7) ""àsqi,} ""ína xazˆla} qáwra p°ìxta.} ‘They go up and find the open grave.’
(A25:91)the syntax of verbs57115.1.1.2. Performative Present (realis)
Another perfective use of the qa†6l is to express the performative present,
i.e. the action denoted by the verb is performed by the act of uttering
it. The form is not, however, regularly used with all verbs that have performative function. Clear performative usage has been indentified in the
verbs qbl ‘to accept, permit’ and ymy ‘to swear’, e.g.
(1) qábl6n ""àz6t.} ‘I permit you to go.’
(2) là-qabl6n ""áz6t.} ‘I forbid you to go.’
(3) yamyannux b-""umr6t òamme. ‘I swear to you by the church of òamme.’
(C2:19)
The performative qa†6l verb may be preceded by the particle of immediacy d6-/de-, e.g.
(4) d6-yamyannux b-awwa k6xwa. ‘I swear to you by this star.’ (C2:25)
(5) d6-yamyannux b-aw Mar Sawa. ‘I swear to you by Saint Sawa.’
(C2:42)
With other verbs speakers express performative function by the compound infinitive + copula construction (§15.4.2.), which is the normal
means of denoting progressive action, e.g. mqawól6n t-à°6n} ‘I promise I
shall come’.
15.1.1.3. Habitual Action (Realis)
In class A verbs imperfective habitual action that includes the present is
normally expressed by the ""i-qa†6l form with the ""i- prefix in main clauses.
The qa†6l form, however, is sporadically found with this function in main
clauses in the text corpus, e.g.
(1) ""u-máxa xa-mèšxa gu-be-""éne dìye} ""oðíle rúšma ""ax-ßlìwa.} ‘They put some
oil on his forehead and make the sign of the cross.’ (B6:36)
The qa†6l form of class B verbs, on the other hand, is frequently used to
express the present habitual, e.g.
(2) kut-b7°a mbáš6l xa-mêndi.} ‘Every household cooks something.’
(B5:64)572chapter fifteen(3) náše j8mi qa-šèra.} ‘People gather for the saint’s festival.’ (B5:69)
(4) šáqli lˆša,} mattíle š-xá párša p†òxa.} ‘They take the dough and put it
on a wide stone.’ (B6:46)
(5) xèlya m5°êxxe,} mar6°xêxxe.} qày6r xán‘i.} d7r6x xa-màsta gáwe,} p7ša màsta.}
""u-""ey-màsta} p7ša xamùßta.} ‘Yoghurt—we fetch milk and boil it. It cools
slightly. We put a portion of yoghurt in it and it becomes yoghurt.
That yoghurt becomes sour.’ (B10:26)
The qa†6l form of class A verbs is more frequently used in verbs expressing habitual aspect that are in subordinate protasis clauses of temporal
sentences, e.g.
(6) ""ím6t ""à°ya,} mzàng6r zága.} ‘When it (the cat) comes, the bell will
sound.’ (A44:2)
(7) fa-l-gàre} ""íman t-aryáwa dùnye,} ""í°wal6n mandòrta.} ‘On the roof, when
it rained, we had a roller.’ (B5:145)
(8) ím6t ""àza másta,} q7°a b-ˆ-""aqla} ta-t-dˆra.} ‘When the yoghurt (churn)
moves, it strikes her leg and returns back.’ (B7:24)
15.1.1.4. Actual Present (Realis)
The qa†6l form is in some cases used imperfectively to refer to a situation
that holds in the present but is not necessarily a permanent, habitual property of the subject of the verb. This usage is restricted lexically to a few
verbs that have a non-dynamic actionality. They include verbs expressing
mental processes or states and verbs of perception, viz. by ‘to want’, txr
‘to remember’, yð"" ‘to know’, xšw ‘to think’, zd""/zdl ‘to fear’, ßbr ‘to dare’,
mßy/""mß ‘to be able’, xzy ‘to see’. The only class A verb in this set is the
variant form ""mß ‘to be able’, which is attested in the qa†6l form without a
y- prefix in the contracted negated forms la-m6ß (< la-""am6ß) ‘He cannot’,
la-mß6t (< la-""amß6t) ‘You cannot’, etc. Examples:
(1) mò b8y6t?} ‘What do you want?’ (A26:73)
(2) ""áp-""ana b8y6n mtanènnux ða-qêßß6t} dìyi.} ‘I also want to tell you a story
of mine.’ (A14:35)
(3) kut-b8ye pál6š mènni pál6š mênni.} ‘Whoever wants to fight with me, let
him fight with me.’ (A12:60)
(4) lá-b>y6n dˆ‰6n.} ‘I do not want to return.’ (A4:43)
(5) tàxrena} kúlla náše qìmela} síqe l-hàwar.} ‘I remember that all the people
got up and went up (the mountain) at the alarm.’ (B5:162)
(6) y8ð6t ""aw-""ˆnile?} ‘Do you know who he is?’ (A4:2)the syntax of verbs573(7)lˆle-x6zya ‘ù-náša} bas-y8ð6x hóla tlíxe ""ánna bàte.} ‘Nobody has
been seen, but we know that the houses have been destroyed.’
(A29:52)
(8) la-y8ð6t mo-qál6t bêxy5le?} ‘Do you not know what the sound of
weeping it is?’ (A4:45)
(9) l7ð6n (< la y>ð6n) k yˆle.} ‘I do not know where he is.’ (B9:9)
(10) míð6n (< mo y>ð6n) ""o-b7°a ""ˆk5le.} ‘I do not know where that house
is.’ (A12:63)
(11) ""u-""ána xášw6n ""áp-bròn-málka b-tàr6ß.} ‘I think, furthermore, that the
son of the king will be cured.’ (A8:88)
(12) mère la-z9d6t?} mère la-z9d6n.} ‘He said “Are you not afraid?” He said
“I am not afraid.” ’ (A11:2)
(13) la-ßábr6x t-òr6x.} ‘We do not dare enter.’ (A14:40)
(14) mère máß y6t mtány6t tuní°a t-la-xàßla?} mèra h5-màß y6n.} ‘He said
“Can you tell a story that does not end?” She said “Yes, I can.” ’
(A36:2)
(15) šùqli.} lá-maß6n díya tanênna.} ‘Leave me alone. I cannot tell (the story)
now.’ (A18:32)
(16) lá-m6ß (< la-""am6ß) xónux daréli gu-s6ndàna.} ‘Your brother cannot put
me in prison.’ (A26:44)
(17) lá-mß6n t-ásq6n xazyànnux.} ‘I cannot go up and find you.’ (A34:29)
(18) bábi tèmm6l ""áyya mðíta xu-kòmta-wawa?} xáz6x ""èdyo hóla xwˆrta.} ‘Father,
was this town not black yesterday? We see today that it is white.’
(A4:36)
The default time reference of such qa†6l forms is the present. They may
also be used in clauses that are dependent on clauses containing past verbs
either syntactically or at least in the discourse structure. In such circumstances they have a relative time deixis and refer to the past, e.g.
(19) ""an-w>zíre gríšela s7pa-w qèšta-w gèra} b8yi máxi †la-d-an-maymùne.} ‘The
ministers drew their sword as well as their bow and arrow, intending to strike the monkeys.’ (A14:44)
(20) Mir-Zándin qìm5le} b8ye qa†êlle.} ‘Mir-Zandin got up, wanting to kill
him.’ (A26:67)
(21) °éle b-l7le xðàra} b8ye t-áx6l xà-m6ndi.} ‘He came at night searching,
wishing to eat something.’ (A43:1)
(22) jírt5la gu-qàwwa} ""u-yìwt6lle ""èlle díye.} šêty6lle.} ""aw-mìðe.} ‘She urinated
in a pot and gave it to him. He drank it. He did not know.’
(A24:37)574chapter fifteen(23) q6m-šawúqla xa-bóya zòra hátxa,} bás mujárrad š6kwánta máßya t-áwra-w
pàl†a.} ‘He left a small hole like this, through which only an ant
could go in and come out.’ (A36:4)
When used to express a temporary state in the actual present or with past
time reference the qa†6l forms of these verbs never take the ""i- prefix. The
verbs are occasionally used in these contexts in the compound infinitive
+ copula form, which is the usual form for the expression of progressive
action in other verbs (§15.4.2.).
15.1.1.5. Deontic Future (Irrealis)
Among the various forms of irrealis expressed by the qa†6l form is deontic
modality. In such cases while occurring in a main clause without being
subordinated to another verb, it conveys an element of will and expresses
various degrees of intention, obligation, request, and permission regarding
a future action. In this function the verb in principle has perfective aspect.
In most cases it presents the action as a complete event with a start and
endpoint. Sometimes it does not have a clearly delimited endpoint, but it
must have a start point future to the present moment.
Main clause verbs in the first person used in a deontic function generally express the intention of the speaker, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)""áz6n ""óð6n qáz6d d-àwwa gèppa.} ‘I shall go and make towards this
cave.’ (A39:3)
""ána q7m6n ""áz6n ""ùmra.} ‘I shall go to church.’ (A37:2)
""ána har-ßál6n mðìta} m7°6n ""ixàla} ""u-""à°ena.} ‘I shall just go down to
the town to bring food and shall come back.’ (A26:30)In the verb ""mr ‘to say’ the modality can be interpreted as expressing either
intention or a request for permission from the hearer:
(4)
(5)""amrênn6x xá-m6ndi.} ‘I shall tell you something./Let me tell you
something.’ (A4:15)
""amrèxlux xà-mdi xéna.} ‘We shall tell you something else./Let us tell
you something else.’ (A39:8)Questions in the qa†6l forms such as (6–9) are deontic expressions whereby
the speaker addresses the hearer expecting him to impose an obligation
(deontic necessity) or give permission (deontic possibility):the syntax of verbs

mò ""awðéna ""ána hadíya?} ‘What should/can I do now?’ (A26:13)
mó ""àw6ð?} ‘What should/can he do?’ (A28:20)
lˆka ""azéxi?} ‘Where should we go?’ (A26:18)Such questions in the 1st person can be transposed into the 3rd person
in indirect questions, e.g.
(10) l7ðe gu-d-7ni kúrsi ""àtu.} ‘He does not know in which chair he should
sit.’ (A40:14)
(11) l7ði mò ""áwði.} ‘They do not know what they should do.’
Deontic qa†6l forms in the 2nd and 3rd person express a variety of types
of will on the part of the speaker, including request, recommendation
and permission, e.g.
(12) ""áxtu kúll5xu ""azítu bˆ°a.} ‘All of you should go home.’ (A8:85)
(13) yába hàyyo,} ""a°ìtu.} ‘ìdetu.} ‘Come, you (are requested to) come. You
are invited.’ (A7:3)
(14) ""ámr6t †la-màlka.} ‘You should say to the king . . .’ (A1:6)
(15) ""áz6t táwrux p5rmêtle.} ‘You should go and slaughter your ox.’ (A7:2)
(16) xúwwe ""áz6l dúke dìye.} ‘Let the snake go to its place.’ (A1:8)
(17) xà-bena ""ázi náše.} ‘People should go (only) once.’ (B15:91)
(18) kút-yom pál†6t ""u-xàðr6t,} ""áß6rta ""á°6t bˆ°a.} ‘Every day go out and wander about and then in the evening come back home.’ (A14:62)
(19) hàtxa ""oðéti b-náše!} ‘This is what you should do to people!’ (A22:47)
This type of deontic qa†6l may occur in indirect speech in a subordinate
clause, e.g.
(20) múr †la-xòn6x} qa-t ""êdyo} ""áwði tàgbir} ""ásqi l-ßˆda.} ‘Tell your brother
that today they should make a plan to go out hunting.’ (A26:43)
The use of the form to express iterative actions as in (18) and (19) above
can be accommodated in the interpretation of it as a perfective form, in
that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express each individual
perfective occurrence of the iterated situation.
The various deontic expressions described above can be negated, e.g.","[606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614]"
"the syntax of nominals
(8)457qímle ""áqla xéta . . . q6m-parêmla.} ‘He cut off another leg (one of a
series).’ (A22:5),(iii) Where the existence of a referent is negated or questioned
In negative or interrogative constructions that deny or question the existence of a referent, where the nominal clearly does not denote a referent
that saliently stands out from the class of items denoted by the description
of the noun, the particle is often omitted, e.g.
(9)la-bàba ""ítle,} la-yêmma ""ítle.} ‘He has neither a father nor a
mother.’ (A14:16)
(10) har-""àww5le} ""6n-""ítle nawàge,} ""6n-""ítle bàba,} ""6n-""ítle yêmma,} ""6n-""ítle

have a father, does he have a mother, does he have brothers?’

(A17:3)
(12) Mar-Yu˙ánna lá-mßele kút-xa dréle qáww6t míya b-rèše.} ‘Saint John
could not put a scoop of water over everybody.’ (B6:10)
When, however, the noun is presented as standing out distinctly as a single
individual member of a identifiable set, the particle may be used. In (13),
for example, the phrase xa-s6ryóqa has the sense of ‘not even one single
member of the set of twigs’:
(13) m5°íwa s6ryòqe,} †árpa q>†íwa y-azìwa.} m5°íwa ""an-q7se naqìðe.} kúlla
torêxwala.} ""áxni la-morêxwa xa-s6ryóqa gu-b7°a ""6n-la-torêxwale.}
torêxwala kúlla baràye.} ‘They would bring thin pieces of wood. We
would break them all. We would not bring a single twig into the
house without breaking it. We would break everything outside.’
(B10:70)
(iv) Focus on descriptive content
The particle tends to be omitted in a variety of contexts in which attention is being directed to the description or descriptive content of the
nominal rather than to a referent. This is clear in cases such as (14) and
(15) in which a specific referent of a nominal is first introduced into the
narrative by a phrase containing the particle and then the definition of458chapter fourteenthe descriptive content of the nominal is clarified in a subsequent clause,
in which the nominal is indefinite but without the particle:
(14) ""ì°wa} xa-ràbb6n,} tíw5wa gu-xa-g6ppì°a.} . . . ràbb6n} y>ð6t-mà-yle?}
ràbb6n} ""áwwa t-i-sàx6ð l-""álaha} ""u-t-i-mßàle-u} lé-y-""ax6l bêsra-w}
""áw y-amríle ràbb6n.} ‘There was once a monk who lived in a
cave. . . . Do you know what a monk is? A monk is somebody who
worships God, who prays and does not eat meat. He is called a
monk.’ (A15:1–4)
(15) múttela xa-sáll6t mìya.} múttela qam-""aqla°èy.} sáll6t míya y8ð6t
mˆla?} béna míya kèlye gu-sàlla?} ‘They had put out a basket of water,
they put it in front of their legs. Do you know what a basket of
water is? But, can water stay in a basket?’ (A16:9–10)
Similarly in (16) the first mention of ‘a mountain’ introduces a specific
referent and has the particle, whereas the following occurrence of the noun
without the particle occurs in an appositional phrase that is intended to
clarify the descriptive content of ‘a mountain’:
(16) síqela gu-xa-†ùra,} †úra ""isáre ramàne.} ‘They went up into a mountain, a mountain (with) high rocks.’ (A15:13)
In (17) the first noun ‘a board’ introduces a referent, but the second
noun ‘a ladder’ in the double object construction (‘to make something
into something’) denotes a change of description rather than a change
of referent:
(17) qím5le mtúrß6lla xa-tàxta,} wíð6lla semàlta.} ‘He constructed a
board and made it into a ladder.’ (A17:23)
Similarly the particle is omitted when attention is directed to the description of the class denoted by a noun rather than to a particular referent
representing the class, e.g.
(18) báxta xá‘‘a zàbbun-ila.} ‘A woman is rather weak.’ (A10:12)
Further examples where the description or descriptive content is the main
concern of the speaker:the syntax of nominals459(19) ""8raq—""í°wa masìna.} masína mturáßt5wa m-""ùpra.} ‘As for arak,
there was (a pot called a) masina. A masina was made from clay.’
(B5:14)
(20) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle ¬a°ì-yome.} ‘A week
for us is seven days and a month is thirty days.’ (A17:13)
(21) ""ína wír5le gáwe díye ""àrya} ""u-plí†5le tèla.} ‘A lion entered it and
a fox came out (i.e. he entered proudly like a lion but came out
stealthily like a fox).’ (A17:34)
A noun that is a predicate in a copula clause and ascribes a descriptive
property to the subject frequently lacks the particle, e.g.
(22) ""áwwa-ži zamàr5le.} ‘He is a singer.’ (A11:4)
(23) ""ána ""6dl7le ""árxa t-áw6n láxxa kêsl6x.} ‘Tonight I shall be a guest in
your home.’ (A17:24)
(24) ""u-xètna l-b7°a pˆšena.} ‘I shall become a son-in-law in the house.’
(A17:35)
If, however, a noun is qualified by an attributive description in the contexts
described above, there is a greater tendency for it to be given the indefinite
particle, since by such qualification its individuation is increased, e.g.
(25) b6llòrta ""ítla.} mattêxla qa-yála zòra,} mattèxxa wàßla,} xa-wáßla
rakìxa.} ‘It had a pipe. We set it up for a young child, we set up
a joining piece, a soft joining piece.’ (B10:77)
(26) ""áti xa-náša xaràm6t.} ‘You are a villainous man.’ (A16:11)
(27) dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.} ‘The dawla
is a box the top of which is open and in which they put wheat.’
(B6:54)
14.1.3. Stress Placement
There is no clear-cut phonological difference between the usage of the
particle xa as a cardinal numeral and its usage as a marker of indefiniteness. As a general rule, however, the particle is stressed when acting as a
cardinal numeral in opposition to another cardinal, e.g.,
(1)
(2)
(3)""í°wa xá-""ot6x yan-trè.} ‘There was one room or two.’ (B5:199)
xalmìwa} xà-si†a} yan-trè-si†e} ‘They become one span or two spans
thick.’ (B5:207)
p5šíwa xá-l5le trè.} ‘They stayed for one night or two.’ (B5:234)460chapter fourteenWhen functioning as a marker of indefiniteness the stress most commonly
falls on the nominal, as can be seen in the examples cited above. Retraction of the stress onto the particle occurs in some cases. This is found
mainly in the following contexts:
(i) Temporal or spatial adverbial expressions:
(4) xàr°a} xá-yoma síqa l-gàre.} ‘Then, one day, he went up onto the
roof.’ (A14:87)
(5) ""áyya xá-šeta hóla támma láxxa l7la mbaqorêllux.} ‘They have been here
for a year but have not asked for you.’ (A26:78)
(6) ""áw máßli xá-duk°a t-óya šaxínta y-amrèxwa gòma.} ‘They deposit it in
a warm place that we called a goma.’ (B5:211)
(7) málla Naßrádin xá-ga b>yéwa mbašèlwa pà‘a.} ‘Once mullah Naßradin
wanted to cook pa‘a.’ (A5:1)
(8) tíwela xá-bena hàd6x.} ‘They sat for a while like that.’ (A26:17)
(ii) Before nouns that are annexed to a following noun:
(9) xá-zawg6t xoriyà°a} ‘a pair of willow trees’ (A26:90)
(10) xá-palg6t sà""6t} ‘half an hour’ (A10:5)
(11) xá-boy6t xùwwe} ‘a snake’s hole’ (A9:6)
(12) xá-bor6t kèpe} ‘a pile of stones’ (A11:5)
The same applies to functionally similar constructions such as (13) and
(14), in which the indefinite noun is combined with a following noun in
apposition:
(13) xá-†ena q7sa ‘a load of wood’ (A14:9)
(14) xá-reša tùma} ‘a head of garlic’ (B10:19)
(iii) Nouns qualified by the modifier ‘other’:
(15) ""è°y5le xá-naša xèna.} ‘Another man came.’ (A12:9)
(16) xàr°a} t-á°e xá-""eða xréna zòra} ‘Afterwards comes another small festival.’ (B6:8)
(iv) Before the word m6ndi ‘thing’:
(17) hálli xá-m6ndi t-àxl6n.} ‘Give me something to eat.’ (A26:57)
(18) b>y6x xá-m6ndi gu-t9ra qablítula.} ‘We want you to pledge something
for her at the door.’ (B10:36)the syntax of nominals461(19) ""at-y8ð6t xá-m6ndi bas-dìye?} ‘Do you know something about it?’
(20) xá-mdi xwàra} ‘something white’ (A14:28)
14.1.4. Suffixed Cardinal Indefinite Particle
The suffixation of the cardinal particle xa to the noun is attested in the
phrase xabra-xa in (1) below. The particle here expresses the internal
uniformity of the referent (‘consensus, agreement’) rather than its individuation:
(1) ""áw-w bàxta,} Č6lk9ze} ""o-yàla,} wídla xàbra-xa.} ‘He and the woman, that
is Č6lk>ze and the young man, made an agreement.’ (A12:37)
14.1.5. Pronominal Use of Indefinite Particle
The cardinal particle xa/ða can be used as an indefinite pronoun independently of a noun, e.g.
(1) bèny6t-6lla ""ót6x tàma,} qá-t mabêsma kút-yom xà.} ‘You have built her
a room there in order for her to entertain somebody everyday.’
(A4:52)
(2) ""ê°y5le xà""a.} ‘A certain person came.’ (A7:24)
(3) ""u-""í°wa †awált6t b6rràne,} xa-ráqa bá°6r d-ò-xena.} ‘There was the game
of “groups”, one person running after the other.’ (B7:6)
(4) béna xá-m6nna mère de-yàlla!} ‘Then one of them said “Go for it!” ’
(A44:3)
(5) mú°y5le trè sus>wá°a.} xa-múxl6lle mêlxa.} ""u-xá har-múš6ty5le mìya.} ‘He
brought two horses. He fed one salt. One he only gave water to
drink.’ (A34:31)
Such indefinite pronouns can be qualified by an adjective, e.g.
(6) xa-gò‰5le.} ‘He is a great one (a great person).’ (A26:72)
(7) d6-mxíli xa-xèna.} ‘Strike me another one (another blow)!’ (A52:24)
If the referent is feminine, there is a greater tendency to use the feminine
form of the particle ða than there is when the particle is used before a
feminine noun, e.g.","[495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500]"
"896chapter seventeen(7) tàwra} primále ðá ""íðe dìye.} ‘The ox—he cut off one of its feet.’
(A22:3)
(8) Dáwið kòra} dbíšla bábe-w yèmme bìye.} ‘Blind David—his father and
mother urged him.’ (A16:5)
An extraposed nominal is in principle definite with an identifiable referent.
In some cases the nominal has not been explicity mentioned, but its referent is referentially anchored in some way to a nominal in the preceding
context, as in (9), where the nominal ‘one room’ is a member of the set
of ‘two rooms’ mentioned earlier. The referent of the nominal may be a
class that is identifiable by its descriptive content alone (10)—(11):
(9) ""ítla trè ""otáxe.} ða-""òt6x} ""áni dámxi gàwa.} ""5-xèta} heywànela.} ‘They had
two rooms. In one room they slept. The other one was (for) the
animals.’ (A22:10)
(10) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse.} ‘But a ladder—it is made of wood.’
(B10:60)
(11) kut-m5°éli xábra b6d-bròni,} ""6n-mí°a ""6n-ßàxi,} pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle
dìye.} ‘Whoever brings me word about my son, whether he is dead
or alive, I’ll give him half of my gold.’ (A14:92)
When the referent of the fronted nominal has the role of direct object
in the clause, marked by a direct object pronominal suffix on the verb, as
in (12)–(15), its syntactic status is ambiguous. This is because there is a
general tendency for there to be a pronominal suffix on the verb agreeing
with a definite direct object constituent irrespective of whether the object
is placed before or after the verb (§15.13.2.1.).
(12) ""a-št7°a šat7wala t-lá mìya.} ‘They drink that drink without water.’
(B5:14)
(13) ""áy ""ilána mßaqlìwala.} ‘They decorate that tree.’ (B5:39)
(14) ""a-štˆ°a} har-tàma mpal†èxwala.} ‘We produced that drink there.’
(B5:11)
(15) ""o-qàmxa} m5°7wale bˆ°a.} ‘They would bring the flour back to the
house.’ (B5:16)
Although there is ambiguity on the level of syntactic structure, certain
object initial clauses possess the functional properties of extrapositional
constructions. This applies to the type of construction that has beenthe clause897referred to in §17.7.5.2. as ‘topic-orientated’ object initial clauses, in which
the object sets the topical frame for the clause. As we shall see, this is a
basic functional property of extraposition. It should also be noted that
the prosodic isolation of the initial object in a separate intonation group,
as in (14) and (15), is a feature common to ‘topic-orientated’ object initial
clauses and extrapositional clauses, but is rarely found in ‘event-orientated’
object initial clauses. ‘Topic-orientated’ object initial constructions with a
resumptive pronoun will be included together with extrapositional constructions in what follows.
17.8.1.2. Resumptive Element
The extraposed constituent is generally resumed in the clause by a
pronominal suffix. The suffix may be on the verb (1), a noun (2) or a
preposition (3):
(1) ""áw y-amríle xêppo.} ‘That—they call it a x6ppo.’ (B5:35)
(2) ""ána x7li hóle gu-xa-q7sa xèna.} ‘I—my strength is in another piece of
wood.’ (A12:39)
(3) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome.} ‘In our commuity a week is seven
days.’ (A17:13)
In some cases the resumptive element is an independent pronoun. In most
of the attested cases this is the subject of the clause, e.g.
(4) jawètta ""áyya t-prêzl5la.} ‘The chopper—it is (made) of iron.’ (B5:140)
(5) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse} ‘But a ladder—it is (made) of wood.’ (B10:60)
(6) bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘Only my eye, which saw
it—let that go to Hell.’ (A16:2)
(7) ""o-t-íle plíxa ""àw bt-áx6l.} ‘Whoever has worked—he will eat.’ (A21:15)
Occasionally the independent resumptive pronoun is the object of the
verb, e.g.
(8) táma ""áti kut-b8y6t gór6t ""àw.} ‘There anybody you like—you can marry
him (= You can marry anybody you like).’ (A8:80)
(9) ""í° pál†a zùrta.} ""5-zúrta ""áy zadìwala.} ‘There was (some of the tobacco)
that came out (as) small (pieces). This small stuff—they threw that
away.’ (B7:17)898chapter seventeenThe resumptive element may even be a full nominal, e.g.
(10) málla píšla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘As for the mullah, the cooking pot
became the mullah’s.’ (A5:10)
In (11) where the extraposed element is a generic relative phrase, the
resumptive noun has an anaphoric demonstrative pronoun:
(11) kú nêšma} t-mà†ya} r6š-gèšr6t Dalàle} ""5-nèšma b6d-pˆša} prìmta,} q†ìlta.}
‘Any soul that comes onto the bridge of Dalale—that soul will be
slaughtered, killed.’ (C8:5)
In (12) an extraposed plural noun does not have any direct resumption,
but is linked to a singular noun in the clause in a set relationship:
(12) bàte} ""áxni qáßra díy6n mubnél6n šét6t xámši-w †¬à°a,} ""u-xámši-w ""àrpa.}
‘As for houses, we had our villa built in the year fifty-three and
fifty-four.’ (B1:20)
An extraposed item may be left without any explicit resumption in the
clause. In such cases the extraposed element sets the orientation of the
clause, similarly to a clause initial adverbial, without playing a syntactic
role in it.
(13) †alòbe,} béna y-oðíwa m5xòlta.} ‘As for the betrothal—they would make
food.’ (B5:7)
(14) m5xólta y-áwa mbúšle qawúrma-w rêzza,} ""u-k6ftàne.} ‘As for the food,
they would have cooked qawurma, rice, meat-balls.’ (B5:15)
(15) palá††6t ""9raq,} t-amrèxi,} y-a°7wa m5°7wa lìne ""í°wa,} d5r7wa lìne,}
""u-d5r7wa mìya gáwa.} ‘As for the production of arak, as we would
say, they used to bring pots, they would put down the pots and
put water into them.’ (B5:12)
(16) sab-xlúla rába náše ‘5dˆwa.} ‘Because the wedding—they invited many
people.’ (B5:23)
A speaker sometimes extraposes the 1pl. independent pronoun in this way
when referring to activities in his own home or community.
(17) ""áxni b-sètwa mš7ra dúnye ràya} m6n-yárx6t ""êßra-w} xadèss6r hòd6x.} ‘We
(= in our community)—in winter it starts raining from October
and November onwards.’ (B5:145)the clause899(18) ""àxni} ""Ón-Núne npílta bel-†úra l-†ùra.} We—""“n-Nune is situated between mountains.’ (B5:148)
(19) ""áxni b7°6t be-bábi ""atìqa-wewa.} ""ína ramán5wa biš-m6n-qáßr6t kùlnaše.} ‘We—the house of the family of my father was old, but
it was higher than the villas of everybody (in our community).’
(B10:51)
In (20) and (21) the resumptive independent pronoun itself stands extraposed from the clause:
(20) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-yèmma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.}
‘A man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or anybody—he—they say concerning him that he has no relatives.’
(A17:17)
(21) xzi-""ánna †¬a-nàše} t-íla prím6lle tàwra,} †¬á°na hon-yíwt6lla mò'6d.} ‘Take
note that the three people who slaughtered the ox—the three of
them—I have given them an appointment.’ (A22:21)
17.8.2. Function
17.8.2.1. Discourse Boundary Marking
The function of the extraposition of an item at the front of a clause is
in most cases to express some kind of boundary and reorientation in the
discourse. The initial nominal expresses the topic referent of the clause,
which often has topical status also in the following clauses. When the
initial topic is given added prominence by being prosodically separated
from the rest of the clause in a different intonation group, the degree of
disjunction from what precedes is in principle enhanced. As we have seen,
subject initial clauses and ‘topic-orientated’ object initial clauses also have
a disjoining function. In these constructions also the degree of disjoining
is enhanced by the prosodic separation of the initial topical constituent.
The subject constituent may be separated from the rest of the clause by
an intonation group boundary, e.g.
(1)
(2)šèra} xa-t6xrùny5le.} ‘The festival is a memorial.’ (B5:69)
náša diyˆni} ""i-ß7mi †¬á yomàne.} ‘Our people fast for three days.’
(B6:21)In copula clauses another type of prosodic separation of the initial subject topic constituent is its detachment from the copula, resulting in a900chapter seventeenconstruction such as (3). Example (4) has the same structure, with the
copula after the subject, without the prosodic separation:
(3) gèrðo ""íla m6n-màsta.} ‘G6rðo is (made) of yoghurt.’ (B5:64)
(4) xúwwele q†ìla!} ‘The snake is killed.’ (A24:42)
It is worth noting that in some other NENA dialects, constructions that
correspond to (3) are extrapositional with an independent resumptive
pronoun attached to the copula, e.g. C. Qaraqosh:
(5) ""ójar ""áhu-l6 xa-mèndi d-gár6šl6 xmàra.} ‘The plough is something that
an ass pulls.’ (Khan 2002: 412)
The types of boundary that are expressed by extrapositional clauses in
the text corpus can be classified as follows:
(i) Beginning of Speech
A speaker often opens a speech turn with a topic referent that is accessible to the hearer. If this is not the subject of the clause, it stands in
extraposition, e.g.
(1) mère yêmmi} ""êdyo} †¬à°na} xon>wá°6t Qára Tè≥din} mopíš6lle l6bbèy.} ‘He
said “Mother, today the three brothers of Qara Te≥din—their hearts
became (angry).” ’ (A26:71)
(2) mèra ""áwwa náša f>qìra} t-awéle xá bronà.} ‘They said “This poor
man—to him will be a son (= he will have a son).” ’ (A8:3)
(3) mère xàli} xmàre,} šáwwa°na hóla xíle l-dèwe.} ‘He said “Uncle, the
asses—the seven of them have been eaten by wolves.” ’ (A23:15)
(4) ßlélux xá-bena xèna?} gúrz6 šèrmux xo-""ána t-azènwa bìya?} ‘ “Have you
come down again?” “Your stupid club (literally: the club of your
behind)—would I have been finished off by it?” ’ (A52:17)
If the subject of the clause is a possession or attribute of the speaker or
hearer, the speech turn often begins with an extraposed 1st or 2nd person
independent pronoun respectively, e.g.
(5) ""ána šèmmi ’ùxole.} ‘I—my name is ’uxo.’ (A7:18)
(6) ""ána x7li hóle gu-xa-q7sa xèna.} ‘I—my strength is in another piece of
wood.’ (A12:39)the clause
(7)
(8)
(9)901""ána ""úrxi rába rìxt5la.} ‘I—my way is very long (= I have a long way
to go).’ (A8:42)
""áxni ""áti xà°6n-iw6t.} ‘We—you are our sister.’ (A34:16)
""áti x7lux ""ˆk5le?} ‘You—where is your strength?’ (A12:38)The choice of extraposed pronoun to open the speech turn depends on
the topicality of the referent in the ensuing discourse. This is seen in (10),
in which the first clause opens with the 2s. pronoun although the grammatical subject is 1fs., since the following clauses are ‘hearer-orientated’,
containing various deontic expressions addressed to the hearer:
(10) ""áti ràba b>yánnux.} bas-msà'6dli xá‘‘a.} hálli xákma mêndi} masqánne l-bˆ°a}
""u-""aßèrta b-l7le ""á°eti kêsli.} ‘I love you a lot. Only, help me a little.
Give me something to take up to the house and tonight come to
me.’ (A22:19)
(ii) New Section of Discourse
On some occasions a construction with an initial extraposed topic referent
occurs at the onset of a section of discourse that is disjoined in some way
from what precedes. Various types of disjunction can be identified.
In (1) the extrapositional clause coincides with a shift in topic referent:
(1)xíllux táma mubsêmlux.} ""ána q6m-†arðìli.} ""è°y6n m-k7rbi hon-xíl6lla ""ày.}
‘You ate there and enjoyed yourself. I—they drove me out and,
out of my anger, I have come and eaten it.’ (A2:11)The construction is used when there is continuity of a topic referent from
the preceding discourse but disjunction on some other level. In narrative it
is used to signal the onset of an event section that is presented as separate
from the previous one:
(2)""ím6t pìdle †úra,} ßàle} ""êlt6x.} réša xtáya kúlle mêlx5le.} sùsux} ""aqlá°e mdurbênnela.} mèlxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye,} t-áwe súsa mßarßòre.} ‘When he has
crossed over the mountain, he will go down. Down hill it is all
salt. Your horse—(when) its legs have become wounded, salt will
strike his legs and he will screech.’ (A24:12)In narrative the construction is used at the onset of a section that supplies some kind of elaboration on what precedes rather than carrying the
narrative forward. In (3) it presents an event that is circumstantial to the902chapter seventeenpreviously mentioned event. The extrapositional clause in (4) provides an
evaluative comment on what precedes rather than an event that is presented as sequential to what precedes. In (5) the narrator opens a section
that shifts to a point earlier in the time-line and recounts the events that
led to the protagonist becoming blind.
(3) qíme dwíqe xá b-aw-rùše} xá b-aw-rùše} nùbl6lle.} ""áw lá snidíle ""áqle dìye}
q6m-nablìle.} ‘They held him, one this shoulder and one the other,
and took him away. His legs did not support him. They took him
away.’ (B9:24)
(4) qímla zrá""a xabùše.} xabúše muntéwala bíya dìya.} ‘They began to cultivate
apples. They were successful with apples.’ (B5:75)
(5) qám d-áyya qêßß6t} t-miràli} Dáwið kòra} dbíšla bábe-w yèmme bìye} mèra
""èllahi magurêxlux.} ‘Before this story that I have told you (so far), the
blind David—his father and mother pressed him and said “By God,
we must marry you.” ’ (A16:5)
In (6)–(8), from descriptive discourse, the extrapositional construction
constitutes an explanatory supplement to what precedes:
(6) béna gu-d-á-dana m5°7wa štˆ°a.} ""a-štˆ°a} har-tàma mpal†èxwala.} ‘At
that time they brought drink. That drink—we produced it there.’
(B5:11)
(7) béna y-oðíwa m5xòlta.} ""á m5xólta náš6t k yàlo y-oðíwala.} ‘They would make
food. The food—the family of the bride would make it.’ (B5:7)
(8) ""í°wa jawêtta.} jawètta ""áyya t-prêzl5la.} ‘There was a chopper. The
chopper—it is (made) of iron.’ (B5:140)
In (9) the construction is used in a clause that repeats the content of the
preceding clause as a strategy to introduce elaborative material:
(9) y-áz6xwa ""áxni zóre m†alèxwa kolàne.} koláne m†alêxwa gáwa.} mattèxwala
bé""e gu-ßawêlta.} ‘We would paint eggs. We young people would go
and play in the streets. The streets—we would play in them and
would put eggs in a shoe.’ (B16:5)
In (10) the construction coincides with a shift from a general description
of a habitual situation to the description of a specific event, which is
offered as an illustration:the clause903(10) yawíwala xà-mdi.} ""ána xmá°i xá-dawa z8ra mutt7°6lli gu-""íð6t xóni ""Ìsh6q.}
‘They would give her (the bride) something. I—my mother-in-law
put a yellow gold coin for me in the hand of my brother Ish6q.’
(B8:35)
An extrapositional construction is used after a presentative clause with
existential particles in (11) and (12). This is likely to be a strategy to mark
off the presentative clause with enhanced distinctness in order to give the
item presented added prominence:
(11) ""í°6n xa-†ùra.} †úra t-ásq6t bíye dìye,} kúlle skinyà°5le.} ‘There is a mountain. The mountain—you should go up it, it is all (covered in)
knives.’ (A24:11)
(12) ""ítl6n ""7n6t ""ùmra.} ""ay-‘ú-ga lá-q7†a-w lá-s6twa bárzi míya dìya.} trè ""5ná°a
""ítl6n.} ‘We have the spring of the church. It—its water never dries
up, in summer or winter.’ (B10:61)
Generic or proverbial statements, which have an inherent independence
and distinctness from the preceding context, may open with an initial
topic standing in extraposition, e.g.
(13) ""ó-t šawèrra šáwwa sêkke,} ða-q7°a gu-be-têkke} ‘He who jumps seven
stakes—(one stake) will hit him in his waist.’ (D2:1)
(14) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-yèmma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.}
‘A man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or
anybody—he, they say concerning him that he has no relatives.’
(A17:17)
In clauses denoting an iterative action containing a constituent with a
universal quantifier, the quantified phrase is often made the topic of the
clause and placed in extraposition, e.g.
(15) kut-mêsta} xa-zága dáry6t bìya.} ‘Put a bell on every hair.’ (A27:8)
(16) kú-reš6t xúwwe °èle,} q6m-maxèle.} ‘He struck each head of the snake
that came (his way).’ (A24:40)
(iii) Opposition between Topics
In some cases the motivation for the extrapositional construction is to set
up an opposition or parallelism between two topic referents. Each topic904chapter seventeenreferent is placed at the front of the clause and stands in extraposition if
it is not the subject referent, e.g.
(1) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle †¬a°ì-yome.} ""áxtu šab°7xu
""6štà-yomela?} ‘We—a week for us is seven days and a month is thirty
days. You—is your week six weeks?’ (A17:13)
(2) ""ítla trè ""otáxe.} ða-""òt6x} ""áni dámxi gàwa.} ""5-xèta} heywànela.} ‘They had
two rooms. One room—they slept in it. The other one—it was (for)
the animals.’ (A22:10)
(3) zeðàye} ""áxl6t mènna t-là-qßaya.} ""u-màsta} ""áxl6t mènna qrúšta díya t-la-xàrwa.}
‘The pittas—you should eat them without breaking them. The
yoghurt—you should eat it without the crust being spoilt.’ (A30:5)
(4) ""ína júllux hálla †làli.} ""u-xmártux t-átw6n ""àna l-xáßa.} ‘Your clothes—give
them to me. Your donkey—I shall sit on its back.’ (A6:8)
In (5) and (6) the extraposition of the topical subject constituent by means
of an independent pronoun is used to mark it off distinctly from a topic
of an adjacent clause:
(5) d>ráje t-kèp5la,} ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse.} ‘Steps are made of stone, but
a ladder—it is made of wood.’ (B10:60)
(6) ""ánna qurðáye barzanàye} ""áni hóla jrà†a.} ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a.} ‘The Barzan
Kurds were slipping, but the Christians were not slipping.’ (B19:7)
(iv) Prominence of Clause
In some cases the main motivation for an extrapositional construction
with a clause initial topic is to mark it off distinctly from what precedes
in order to give it prominence, e.g.
(1) °éle xa-hambišàya.} hambišàya} ""ˆ-ga} xír5le bìye,} ""áwwa náša lèbbe pqìle!} ‘A
giant came. The giant looked at him. That man’s heart burst (with
fear).’ (A31:2)
(2) lá-b>y6x la-mìya} ""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ""áxni har-xòn6n-it!} ‘We do not want
water or anything else. You are indeed our brother.’ (A39:12)
In (3) the extrapositional clause marks the climactic point of the discourse
section, the origin of the name of the church being the main point of
the narrative:the clause905(3) gu-d-ò-""umra} †ùmr6lle} ""u-bènyela ""úmra b-réše dìye.} ""áw mútt6lle šèmme díye
Mar-Sàwa.} ‘They buried him in (the site of) that church and built the
church over him. They gave it the name of Saint Sawa.’ (B6:30)
17.8.2.2. Topic Referents Obligatorily Resumed by L-Suffixes
In certain clauses, an initial topic referent regularly stands in extraposition
and is resumed on the verb by an L-suffix. These include the following:
(i) ‘Naming’ Constructions with the Verb ""mr
(1) ""ó-""eða y-amrèxle šèra.} ‘That festival—we call it a šera.’ (B6:22)
(2) ""áyya y-amrèxla m>màðta.} ‘This—we call it baptism.’ (B6:8)
(3) ""áni xa†oryà°a y-amríla.} ‘They are called “washing-boards.” ’ (B19:9)
(ii) Possessive Constructions with the Existential Particle
(4) ßlí°5la bàxta} xzí°a qa-màlla.} málla ""ítle d6kkán6t ""aparù°a.} ‘The woman
went down (to the town) and saw the mullah. The mullah had a
shop of household goods.’ (A22:11)
(5) ""áw ""ítle ða-""ót6x ""ax-d-àyya.} ‘He has a room like this one.’ (A21:5)
(6) ""àxni} gu-""Ón-Nùne} ""ítl6n šèra.} ‘We in ""“n-Nune have a saint’s festival.’
(B5:72)
(iii) Clauses Containing Verbs with Impersonal Subjects
(7) "">wáha t-ile xóðe díye b>yéle bàxta.} ‘The man who is alone needs a
wife.’ (A27:7)
17.8.2.3. Narrow focus
In some cases the nuclear stress is placed on an independent pronoun
that resumes an extraposed nominal phrase. This puts narrow focus on
the referent. The construction is typically used when the nominal is a
long phrase, e.g.
(1) kùt la-pál6x} gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a} ""ixála lè y-áx6l.} ""o-t-pàl6x} ""àw t-áx6l.}
‘Whoever does not work in this house will not eat food. Whoever
works—he (and not anybody else) will eat.’ (A21:13)
(2) qa-mó g8r6g ""áz6l kúlla páxri gu-nùra,} gu-jahànnam?} bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày
xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘Why should all my body go to the fire, to
Hell? Only my eye that saw it—let it go to Hell.’ (A16:2)906chapter seventeen
17.9. Miscellaneous Clausal Particles17.9.1. n6mu/l6mu
This particle gives an expostulatory or hortatory sense to questions. When
used to introduce negative questions, which is its most frequent usage, the
question is equivalent in function to an asseveration, e.g.
(1) nèmu la-mèri-llux dày6‰,} mí°a dày6‰?} ‘Did I not tell you that he would
return (= indeed I told you . . .), that the dead would return?’
(A22:39)
(2) nèmu ""áxni xlúl6t Gwèrg6s la-xálti zwínna kéke dìye} mèra ða-dabàšta?} ‘At
the wedding of Gw6rg6s did not my aunt buy his cake and say
“(I buy it) for a beehive? (= indeed my aunt bought his cake . . .)” ’
(B8:29–30)
(3) nèmu la-""awðèxle ""áwwa †ùra} d>rajyà°a,} d>ràje,} t-ásq6x l-áwwa †ùra?}
‘Should we not make for this mountain steps (= indeed let us
make . . .), so that we can go up the mountain?’ (A17:4)
(4) lèmu lá-""asq6n ""àna?} ‘Should I not go? (= indeed I should go)’
(A39:10)
(5) lèmu lax-xnìq6llux?} ‘Have we not drowned you? (= surely we have
drowned you)’ (A7:22)
Occasionally the most appropriate translation of the particle is ‘why?’,
e.g.
(6) lat-nxàpa!?} xá ""axwá°i mìra} dráya šlámi ""êllux} ""u-""áti tíwa l-†ìzux!} lèmu
la-qìmlux?} ‘Are you not ashamed!? A prince like me greets you and
you sit on your bum. Why did you not get up?’ (A26:48)
The particle is occasionally used in positive questions, where it has a
remonstrating force, e.g.
(7) nèmu ""áyya bèrke d-ˆnila} t-it-""áti sxáya gàwa?} ‘Whose is this pool in which
you are swimming? (= surely it is mine not yours)’ (A25:61)
17.9.2. xo-/xuThis particle, which is related etymologically to Syriac k∫ar, is used most
frequently in negated clauses. When used in non-interrogative clauses, it
intensifies the negation, often with a remonstrating force, e.g.","[934, 935, 936, 937, 938, 939, 940, 941, 942, 943, 944, 945]"
"486chapter fourteenThe usual function of this construction is to indicate that the referent
of the noun is accessible in the memory of the hearer rather than in the
current discourse history. The indefinite particle by itself indicates to the
hearer that the referent is newly introduced and not accessible. Its combination with the anaphoric demonstrative is used as a device to signal that
it is newly presented in the current discourse but nevertheless recoverable
from some discourse or experience that took place on some other occasion
in the past. It is, therefore, less easily accessible than referents that have
a connection with the preceding discourse. Examples:
(1) °éle ""o-xa-náša t-in mír6llux tèmm6l t-a°e ""êdyo?} ‘Has that man come
who I said to you yesterday would come today?’
(2) °éle ""o-xa-náša t-ít x6zy6lle têmm6l?} ‘Has the man whom you saw yesterday come?’
(3) txár6t ""o-xa-náša t-wéwa láxxa qam-šàb°a?} ‘Do you remember the man
who was here a week ago?’
(4) txár6t ""a-ġða-báxta kóre t-wáwa gu-mà°a?} ‘Do you remember the blind
woman who was in the village?’
(5) txár6t ""án-xa xon>wá°a kóre t-w7wa gu-mà°a?} ‘Do you remember the
blind brothers who were in the village?’
Examples from the text corpus:
(6) txár6t ""an-xa-tré t-mut6pqíwal6n b-ġðàðe?} ‘Do you remember the couple
that we brought together?’ (A4:45)
(7) ""ána ""o-xà qáša} t-ín ""è°ya gu- iyàre,} q6m-doqètli xošètli gu-gòma.} ‘I am
the priest who (you remember) came to iyare, whom you seized
and confined in the basement stable.’ (B17:15)
(8) ""u-hád6x ""í°wa ""án-xa sobá°6t kêsl6n,} bux5rìyewa.} ‘The stoves (you
remember) in our community were thus, they were smoke ducts.’
(A4:60)
(9) ""o-xá-m6ndi ""íle xêzwa ""è°y6lli} l7le xêlma.} ‘The thing (that I remember
seeing) is a vision that came to me, it is not a dream.’ (A8:7)
In (10) the referent of the noun ‘washing-board’ is, in fact, mentioned
in the immediately preceding discourse. The demonstrative + indefinite
particle construction, however, makes an anaphoric connection with an
earlier conversation in the memory of the interlocutor rather than with
the mention in the current discourse. Similarly in (11) ‘the blind wolf ’ is
mentioned in the preceding question of the woman. The demonstrativethe syntax of nominals487+ indefinite particle construction in the response of the husband, however, makes an anaphoric connection with the story about the wolf that
the woman remembers rather than with the mention of the wolf in her
current question:
(10) q6m-qa†líle b-xa†oryà°a,} ""an-xá xa†oryá°a t-ínwa màr6llux} mási jùlle
bíya.} ‘They killed him with washing-boards, the washing-boards
which I was telling you they used to wash clothes with.’ (B19:9)
(11) xá-yoma mbuqèrra mèra mòdi m-áyya qèßß6t díye ""o-déwa kòra?} mêre} ""êrw6n}
""o-xá-dewa kóra dmìxa gu-†úra.} kút-yum xá-""6rw6n y-arèqwa y-ás6q
qám . . . d-o-dèwa,} ""aw y-axêlwale.} ‘One day she asked saying “What
is this story about the blind wolf ?” He said “Our sheep—the blind
wolf (you remember me talking about) is sleeping in the mountains.
Every day one of our sheep would run up to that wolf and he
would eat it.”’ (A10:5)
14.4. Annexation Constructions
As described in §10.16., when one noun is annexed to another by means
of the particle D (§4.4.), the first noun in the phrase is a head noun and
the second is a dependent modifier. The modifier noun is, in principle,
restrictive in function. Various types of semantic relationship exist between
the head and the modifier, including:
(i)Item—possessor, e.g. ßáwl6t màlka} ‘the shoe of the king’ (A17:28),
""árx6t be-Xàmmo} ‘the water-mill of the family of Xammo’
(A19:1).
(ii) Part—whole, e.g. yomán6t yàrxa} ‘the days of the week’ (A17:15),
kot8l6t ""êrxe} ‘the channel of the water-mill’ (A22:45).
(iii) Vessel—contents, e.g. xa-kawáz6t mìya} ‘a pot of water’ (A21:10),
ða-qènn6t d6bbòre} ‘a nest of hornets’ (A20:6).
(iv) Item—affiliation, e.g. ""áġ6t ô?l ‘the lord of ôāl’ (A19:2), málk6t
Màġr6b} ‘the king of Morocco’ (A28:37), ""ánna náš6t mà°a} ‘these
people of the village’ (A48:2), brón6t màlka ‘the son of the king’
(A32:21).
(v) Item—material, e.g. xa-†ás6t dàwa} ‘a goblet of gold’ (A15:11), šíš6t
prêzla ‘bars of iron’ (A19:4).
(vi) Time—event, e.g. dán6t kawù°ra ‘lunch-time’ (A22:22).
(vii) Item—attribute, e.g. xále díye t-˙aqqù°a} ‘his real uncle’ (A23:28).","[524, 525, 526]"
"the syntax of verbs705The basic function of the infinitive compound construction is to express
progressive aspect, i.e. it denotes an activity that is taking place at the
present moment but is not necessarily a permanent, habitual property of
the subject of the verb.
In positive clauses the deictic or enclitic copula may be used with the
infinitive. The copula may also be omitted altogether. In principle these
three different constructions are used by the speaker to endow the clause
with varying degrees of communicative salience. This salience scale may
be represented as follows, in which the construction with the deictic copula
is highest in salience and the form with no copula is lowest:
hole q†ala> q†al5le>q†alaIn negative clauses only two degrees of communicative salience are
expressed, one with the negative copula and one with the negative particle la alone:
l5le q†ala> la q†alaThe degree of salience depends on various factors. One consideration is
the factivity of the proposition. Clauses expressing assertive, factive propositions are high in communicative salience in that the speaker is committed
to its factuality. Non-factive propositions do not involve such commitment
and are low in communicative salience. This is reflected by the fact that
the deictic copula is normally used with the infinitive in conversation
when the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to an activity that
exists in the current speech situation, e.g. hole °aya ‘He is coming’. In interrogative clauses, on the other hand, the enclitic copula is used, e.g. °ay5le?
‘Is he coming?’ In negative main clauses there is no formal distinction
between assertive and interrogative propositions: l5le °aya ‘He is not coming’, l5le °aya? ‘Is he not coming?’ Examples from the text corpus:
(1) hóla ßláya r6š-""ˆna.} ‘She is going down to the spring.’ (A26:40)
(2) hon-wáða ""ixàla.} ‘I am making food.’ (A21:27)
(3) hóla dwáqa nàše.} ‘They are seizing people.’ (A25:80)
(4) ""áti hot-wáða xákma šulàne} báxta m6n-gáw‰a hot-šqàl6lla} ""u-hot-baróx6lla
l-gànux.} ‘You are doing (bad) things, you are taking a woman from
her husband and wedding her to yourself.’ (A25:81)
(5) dúnye hóla ràya.} ‘It is raining.’ (A26:46)
(6) †8y6t xòn6x?} ‘Are you searching for your brother?’ (A8:64)
(7) hár-dwaq6t rêqqi?} ‘Are you still insisting?’ (A40:4)706
(8)
(9)chapter fifteen
""u-""èdyo ""áti lat-wáða b-xàbri.} ‘Today you are not doing as I said (you
should).’ (A22:43)
lat-mtaxmóne m6n-nàše?} ‘Are you not thinking of the people?’
(A25:60)Another factor that contributes to communicative salience is the actionality of the verb. Verbs that have a non-dynamic actionality, which express
mental processes rather than perceptible activities, exhibit a greater tendency to have the enclitic copula when being used with progressive aspect
than do verbs with a dynamic actionality, with which the deictic copula
is used to a greater degree, e.g.
(10) b-xšáw6n gáw‰i °èle.} ‘I think my husband has returned.’ (A39:18)
(11) ""ana-txár6n y-a°7wa xo-tú°a óùwa.} ‘I remember they would come (and
sit) under the smooth mulberry tree.’ (B5:203)
(12) ""ána xzáy6n ""an-maymúne . . . hóla xál6lla q†àl6lla.} ‘I see that they are
eating and killing the monkeys.’ (A14:52)
(13) zdàl6x.} ‘We are afraid.’ (A14:40)
(14) pšàm6n rába.} ‘I am very sorry.’ (A1:11)
(15) ""ána mštawhór6n m-bnòni.} ‘I am proud of my children.’
The degree of communicative salience also depends on the nature of the
grammatical subject. In some expressions with impersonal subjects the
infinitive is used without a copula. This applies to the verb m-byn ‘to
appear’, e.g.
(16) mabyóne †úra gu-‘ól ramàn5le.} ‘It seems it is a high mountain in the
countryside.’ (A8:70)
(17) mabyóne ""ì°-xa-m6ndi gu-qèßß6t.} ‘It appears that there is something in
the story.’ (A4:18)
Note also the regular omission of the copula on the infinitive in meteorological expressions such as dunye raya ‘It is raining’ or raya talga ‘It is
snowing. The grammatical subject dunye (literally: ‘the world’) refers to
the general situation.
For some of the verbs expressing mental processes the qa†6l form is
often used to express the progressive aspect rather than the infinitive
construction. This applies to the verbs by ‘to want’, yð"" ‘to know’, zd""/zdl
‘to fear’, ßbr ‘to dare’, mßy / ""mß ‘to be able’ and xzy ‘to see’ (§15.1.1.4.).
The infinitive construction is used in some circumstances to express thethe syntax of verbs707progressive, but its distribution differs with each verb. It is rarely used at
all with by ‘to want, to like’. With zd"" ‘to fear’ and xzy ‘to see’ it is used
interchangeably with the qa†6l form. With the verbs yð"", and mßy there is
a tendency to use it with negated forms of the verb rather than positive
forms. Examples from the text corpus:
(18) hon-b9y6llux,} t-amrênnux.} ‘I like you so I shall tell you.’ (A14:78)
(19) lˆla b8y6lle?} ‘Doesn’t she want it?’ (A30:32)
(20) ""ána ""êllux-in zdá""a.} ‘I am afraid for you.’ (B9:27)
(21) l5n-zdá""a ""ap-d6ndêk°a.} ‘I am not afraid, even a little.’ (B9:17)
(22) xzáy6t "">náha naše-t-íla ráqa bà°ri?} ‘Do you see those people who are
running after me?’ (A7:17)
(23) l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
(A17:2)
(24) làn-ða""a l7k5la zílta.} ‘I do not know where she has gone.’ (A26:11)
(25) lát-ða""a ""o-""ˆnile?} ‘Do you not know who that is?’ (B15:81)
(26) lán-mßaya jwàja.} ‘I cannot move.’ (A24:2)
(27) lán-mßaya mattánna b-""ìði.} ‘I cannot put it on my hand.’ (A26:21)
A further factor that affects the communicative salience of the infinitive
construction is its information status. This is reflected in the tendency for
the enclitic copula rather than the deictic copula to be used when the
verbal form is low in information value and the main information focus
is on its complement. This is seen in (28) in which the verb xðár6n ‘I am
going around, I am searching’ in the answer to the question is presupposed to be known to the hearer, the main point of the utterance being
the complement ‘after my sustenance’, which indicates the purpose of
the bear’s action:
(28) ""o-tèla} mère há lˆk6t zála,} ya-gáni dêbba?} b-álaha xðár6n bá°6r rêsqi.} ‘The
fox said “Hey, where are you going, my dear bear?” ‘By God, I’m
going around (searching) after my sustenance.’ (A20:1)
The compound infinitive is used to express a continuing situation that has
been in existence for a specified period of time. Such constructions are
translated by the English present perfect, e.g.
(29) ""u-""ána ""anna-šawwá-š6nne hon-°àya.} ‘I have been travelling (literally:
coming) for these (last) seven years.’ (A37:17)708chapter fifteen15.4.2.3. Function in Narrative
The infinitive construction is used in narrative discourse. In such contexts
the infinitive has either the deictic, the enclitic copula or the copula is
omitted altogether.
When the deictic copula is used with the infinitive in narrative contexts,
the construction generally has its usual progressive sense. Its function is
to express an event that is in progress and overlaps temporally with an
adjacent punctual event. It is negated in the usual way by the negative
copula. The copula takes the past time reference of the adjacent narrative
as its deictic centre. The construction may be placed after the verb(s) with
which it overlaps temporally. It may have the same subject referent as the
preceding verb (1–2) or a different subject referent (3–5), e.g.
(1) plí†5le zíl5le hóle gašòqe.} ‘He went out, went off, watching.’ (A22:24)
(2) zílle kléle xóðe t>màha.} har-hóle xyára b-ó-Äab6t ""6ngl6znàya.} hóle zdà""a.}
‘He went to stand alone far away. He kept looking at that English
officer. He was afraid.’ (B17:13)
(3) sìqt5la,} ""o-pà‰a} hóle mbarbòre,} har-mbarbòre,} l7le klàya.} ‘She went up,
while the lamb bleated and bleated, incessantly.’ (A34:28)
(4) ""è°y5le xá-naša xèna,} lwíša lwíšta smòqta,} súsa smòqa,} rúmxa smòqta.} b-l7le
rúmxe díye hóla mxáya kizêkke,} ma-t-íle ""o-náša ràba x5làna.} ‘Another man
came, dressed in red clothing, with a red horse, a red spear. In the
night his spear was giving off sparks, so powerful was that man.’
(A12:9)
(5) ""u-murízela mbádla jàlde} síqela ""6st6qbàl t-màlka,} xéna ""ax-t-óði ""6st6qbàl
t-màlke,} b-iqàra-w} ""áyya hóla mparòje,} káza xyára hàtxa} ta-t-xazyále †líba
dìye,} lˆla xzay6lle.} ‘They lined up in the early morning and went up
to receive the king, as they (customarily) receive kings, with honour,
while she was watching, peering like this to see her betrothed, but
she does not see him.’ (A4:35)
The construction with the deictic copula is used to express an event that
is discovered to be in progress on the arrival on the scene of a character
in the narrative, e.g.
(6) ßêly5le} ""ína M8mo-w Zìne} hóla nšáqa ©ðàðe.} ‘He came down and (found)
M>mo and Zine kissing each other.’ (A26:46)
(7) ""ína xazèla} Zíne-w M9mo} hóla mê-©ðaðe mßawó°e.} ‘He sees Zine and
M>mo while they were speaking with one another.’ (A26:57)the syntax of verbs709The activities may be a sequential series of events that are not all existing simultaneously, but rather the overall event expressed by the series of
individual events is presented as temporally overlapping with the main
narrative, e.g.
(8)""ítwale xa-xurzàya,} b7°e díye šètt6t mà°a-wewa.} šèmme díye Bè≥6m-wewa.}
q6m-xazéle xále díye Rust8mo zàla.} mère xáli lˆk5t zála?} mère ""áw lˆle šúlux.}

hóle zdáy6lle bar-ðá-got6t dúnye.} Rust8mo mêre} xwàrza,} lá-wuð
hàtxa.} ‘He had a nephew, whose house was at the bottom of the
village. His name was Be≥6m. He saw his uncle Rustam going
off. He said “Uncle, where are you going?” He said “That is not
your business.” What was Be≥6m doing? He was holding the top
of a poplar tree and bending it down, young children were coming and going up the poplar, he was letting the top of the poplar
go, the poplar was springing up and he was flinging the young
children in all directions. Rustam said “Nephew, don’t do that.” ’
(A29:15–17)The infinitive construction with a deictic copula may denote an ongoing event that overlaps temporally with a resultant state expressed by a
resultative participle, e.g.
(9)""ánna ßàli} ""ína mò ßáli!} hóla sus>wà°a} jêmye b-réše díye} wáða hêlma} bréše dìye.} ‘They went down but what (a surprise when) they went
down. The horses were gathered over him, blowing onto him.’
(A25:13)
(10) hóle l-5-gòt-hòd6x,} dèrya ða-kùlla,} dmíxa tàma,} mu†6lya-g yáne dìye.} ""áni hóla
wáða tàgbir.} ‘He was on the other side. He had put up a mosquito
net and was lying there, pretending to be asleep, while they were
making a plan.’ (A30:42)
The construction with the deictic copula is used in a section of discourse
that presents a preliminary section that provides the background against
which a following series of punctual events in the foreground of the narrative take place. In (11), for example, the forms hóla nšàq6lle and hóla spára
occur in a section of discourse that sets the scene for the main foreground710chapter fifteenevent of the passage, namely that one of the angels sneezed because of
the soot. It is noteworthy that the resultative participles in this preliminary
background section also have the deictic copula (§15.4.1.3.):
(11) ""o-yála zóra hóla mútt6lle be-pàlga.} ""áy hóla nšàq6lle,} nšàq6lle,} nšàq6lle,}
xpáq6lle gu-ßádra dìya.} ""u-yáw6lle †la-bábe dìye.} ""áp-aw nšàq6lle,} nšàq6lle,}

sobá°6t kêsl6n,} bux5rìyewa.} síq5le xákma m6n-d-ò-š6mra,} wír5le gu-naxír6t
xa-m-malàxe.} ""u-wíð5le pê°yo!} tpì°5le.} ‘They put the small child in
the middle. She is kissing and kissing and kissing him and hugging him to her breast. Then she gives him to his father. He also
kisses and kisses and kisses him. The angels have come and have
sat by the window. They are waiting by the window for the time
to finish, for them to put down the child so that they could take
away their soul. There were stoves in our community that were
smoke ducts. Some of the soot went up and entered the nose of
one of the angels. He went “achoo!” He sneezed.’ (A4:58–60)
The infinitive construction is often used in narrative with a perfective
aspect to express an event that is sequential to what precedes. In such cases
the infinitive generally has the enclitic copula or the copula is omitted
altogether. Aspect, therefore, is a further factor that conditions the type
of copula marking on the construction.
The copula is typically omitted in a chain of clauses expressing closely
knit events after the subject of the verb chain has been identified by the
copula in the first clause. The copula is used when there is a change in
subject referent. This can be seen in examples (12)–(14) below. It should
be noted that the infinitive with a 3rd person enclitic copula followed by
a 3rd person pronominal suffix is identical in form to the equivalent construction without the copula (e.g. q†al6lle < q†al5le + -6lle or q†ala + -6lle). The
presence of the copula cannot, therefore, be discerned in these forms.

the youngest son . . . He went out and he (Barz6kko) killed also
him. Barz6kko went in attacking her, the mother of the giants. . . .
He killed also her. He went down. He had a servant. He handed
over his horse to the servant. He entered his tent and slept until
morning. In the morning they got up . . . They said “Wake Barz6kko!
For how long will he sleep?” They woke him . . . and went on their
way. They went a long way and arrived at an orchard. . . . Another
man arrived.’ (A12:6–9)
On some occasions a chain of clauses opens with an infinitive without the
copula when the subject is identifiable from the context and the opening
clause is closely connected semantically with what precedes. This is the
case, for example, in (15), in which the infinitive chain begins after direct
speech:
(15) hállule xa-sùsa.} tèmm6l mbádla ""àz6l.} šqála dárt-yoma xà-susa} táwa xáße
díye zàla.} ‘ “Give him a horse. Let him go tomorrow morning.” ’
The next day he took a horse, sat on its back and went off.’
(A12:59–60)
In some tightly knit verb sequences two infinitives are juxtaposed with
the copula on the second one, reflecting the fact that they are treated
as a single unit. This is attested where the first verb is qym (16) or a verb
of movement (17), or where two verbs of similar meaning are juxtaposed (18):
(16) qyáma sàq5la.} ‘They rise and go up.’ (A13:1)
(17) ráqa °ày5le.} ‘He runs and comes back.’ (A29:50)712chapter fifteen(18) ‘ar‘óre ""u-ßráx5la ë6nn6kˆra} ‘She screams and cries all around.’
(A51:15)
We should include here the use by narrators of the infinitive form mára
without a copula at various points in the text. The literal meaning of this is
‘It says’, the subject being the story itself. It is sequential to what precedes,
in that it marks an advance of the narrative. The narrator typically inserts
this formula at the beginning of new episodic sections, especially where
there is a change in spatio-temporal location. It is more idiomatically
translated into English by a discourse connective such as ‘now’, e.g.
(19) mára yóm6t trè} ""ay-là xílla.} ‘Now the next day she did not eat.’
(A21:14)
(20) mára qìm5le} qédamta híw5le xàbra.} ‘Now, the next day he gave word.’
(A26:45)
(21) mára ßèly5le r6š-""ˆna.} ""áw ""u-súse díye ßèlyela r6š-""ˆna,} xèzy6lla xákma
baxtá°a tàma.} ‘Now, he went down to the spring. He and his horse
went down to the spring. He saw some girls there.’ (A26:23)
(22) mára qím5le ""è°ya síqa l-gàre.} ‘Now, he came and he went up onto
the roof.’ (A26:40)
(23) mára Qára Té≥din zìl5le,} yíw6lla ""íðe gu-""íð6t M9mo.} ‘Now, Qara Te≥din
went and put his hand in the hand of M>mo.’ (A26:50)
On some occasions an infinitive construction that functions as a narrative
present with a perfective aspect has a deictic copula. In such cases the
intention of the speaker is to draw particular attention to the event in
question for some reason. The construction sometimes expresses an event
that was unexpected as a sequel to the preceding event. In (24) and (25),
for example, the speaker is astounded by what another character in the
narrative said after the event that is reported in the preceding clause. The
event of the horse bolting in (26) is also a sudden, unanticipated event. In
(27) the deictic copula signals the extraordinary action of the hero, which
ordinary men would not have been expected to carry out.
(24) ""è°y6x xa-néra benà°6n} hóle màra} bábi t-óð6xle gêšra.} mèri m-7ka

our journey). He says “My friend, let’s make a bridge for it.” I
asked from where I should bring him wood, from where I shouldthe syntax of verbs713bring him nails and a saw so that I could make a bridge for him
to cross over!’ (A17:9)
(25) nublìli} hóle mára †làli} lè y-axlènna.} ‘I took them, but he says to
me “I shall not eat them.” ’ (A17:14)
(26) mbádla tíwa xáße díye ""u-plì†5le.} ""7-ga súsa k6má-dana l7le-x6zya šêmša,}
hóle pràxa.} ‘In the morning he sat on its back and went out.
Since the horse had not seen the sun for so long, it bolted (literally:
flew off ).’ (A12:66)
(27) kú-t-ile ßláya tàma} lˆla mßáya bíye díye} hóle q†àl6lla.} Rust8mo ferêss5le.}
‘All those who went down there could not defeat him and he killed
them. Rustam was a mighty warrior.’ (A29:60)
The deictic copula is also found where the narrator wishes to express some
kind of boundary in the narrative. This may coincide with a shift in scene
and subject referent. In (28), for example, the narrator shifts attention to
the character Be≥6m at a different location in the village. The chain of
sequential clauses recounting his activities opens with an infinitive with a
deictic copula. Subsequent events in the scene that are expressed by the
infinitive construction have the enclitic copula or zero copula. In (29) the
attention shifts to the character Zine in a different location from that of
the preceding narrative. The adverbial ""axxa ‘over here’ is used by the
narrator to indicate a shift in scene. The clause expressing the opening
event of this scene has a deictic copula (hola †laba). The following clause,
which can be considered to be an elaboration of the first, also has the
deictic copula (hola mara). In (30) the clause with the deictic copula coincides with a change in subject. This clause may also be interpreted as the
resumption of the main narrative foreground, the two preceding clauses
being a preliminary background section. In (31) the speaker narrates the
events of a dream. The deictic copula is used to mark the crossing of
the bridge as a boundary in the discourse, presenting it as the onset of a
chain of clauses that constitute a distinct overall event from what precedes.
The clause is also presented as a new section of direct speech. Similarly
in (32) the speaker uses the deictic copula to present the series of clauses
narrating the second attempt to fire the bullets as a separate overall event
from what precedes.
(28) Bé≥6m hóle šètt6t má°a mòdile wáða?} hóle zàla} ða-gót6t mà°a} mxáy6lla

it away, then put in another one, but also that one comes out (as
a blank) with a bang. We point it at her back to kill her, but the
bullet comes out (as a blank) with a bang.’ (B9:21)
It is relevant to note here that the narrative formula ‘it (the story) says’
is sometimes used with the deictic copula at the beginning of the story,
whereas in the body of the narrative it is used without a copula (mara),
e.g.
(33) hóla màra:} ""í°wa xa-màlka.} ‘It says: There was a king . . .’ (A1:1–2)
Another context in which the deictic copula is used when the infinitive
construction has perfective aspect is where the construction expresses an
event that is off the main narrative line and provides background information. This event is not necessarily sequential to what precedes. In (34)the syntax of verbs715and (35), for example, the construction with the deictic copula clarifies
the identity of the speaker:
(34) zílle mêre}—""áwwa ’ixàlo hóle mára}—zílle mêre} málka ""áti har-t-yàtli
brátux?} ‘He went and said—it is ’ixalo who says this—he went
and said “King, will you still give me your daughter?” ’ (A25:24)
(35) mère ""ána mò,} xo-là p7š6n š>vána-llux.} Fàrxo hóle mára.} mère ""ána bt-àzena.}
‘He (Farxo) said “What am I? I shall not become a shepherd for
you”—Farxo says (this). He said “I shall go.” ’ (A25:32)
15.4.2.4. Habitual Function
On some occasions the infinitive construction expresses an activity that
is of habitual recurrence but may not necessarily be taking place at the
time of speech. It is used to express an iterative rather than a permanent
durative situation. This differs from the ( ""i-)qa†6l(wa) form, which may
express either an iterative or a permanent situation. The iterative function
can be considered to be an extension of the perfective narrative present
function described above, which would be appropriate to describe each
individual occurrence of the iterated situation.10 It is relevant to note
that when the construction has this function, the infinitive is occasionally
replaced by the verbal noun, which expresses a single occurrence of an
action (§15.6.3.).
The iterative events may be presented as sequential to one another.
In such cases the copula, if it is not attached to some other item in the
clause, is usually cliticized to the infinitive or omitted altogether, as is the
case with the perfective narrative present usage, e.g.
(40) bár hàd6x,} bár t-ila-báxta pyáša rásmi tàma} yá'ni wára gu-l-bˆ°a,} °áy5le
qàša} ""u-sá‰a gnùn5le.} ‘After the woman becomes official there,
that is she enters the house, the priest comes and ties the band.’
(B5:44)
(41) ""íman-t-ile náša mq>ròne} mjaròbele} qa-t-xáze xayú°a biš-spày.} ‘When
somebody grows up, he tries to find a better life.’
This iterative function of the infinitive construction expressing the perfective present is indeed found in narrative discourse itself, e.g.","[743, 744, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754]"
"826chapter seventeen(17) hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye} ""u-hóle míra ""áyya bráti
qa-brònux.} ‘This is the situation: the king has brought his daughter
and said “This daughter of mine is for your son, that is she will
become your wife.” ’ (A21:8)
The enclitic copula, therefore, expresses a general prominence, which is
unmarked with regard to its pragmatic nature. The nucleus of the intonation group, on the other hand, expresses a new information focus. The
two devices usually coincide, in that the enclitic copula is generally placed
on the element that is the new information focus of the clause. They may,
however, operate independently, as in (14)–(17).
On some occasions the subject constituent is placed after the predicate.
In such cases the enclitic copula and the nuclear stress are generally on
the predicate, e.g.
(18) ""àww5le geyása.} ‘The geyasa ceremony is this.’ (B6:4)
(19) ""ànn5la ""eð>wá°6 diy7ni.} ‘Our festivals are these.’ (B6:16)
(20) y-ásq6x m7°6x míya m6n-d->wàha †úra.} rába rê˙q5le ""o-†úra.} ‘We shall go
up and fetch water from that mountain over there. That mountain
is very far away.’ (A39:9)
(21) mšadóre ""èlla dìya} ""u-náše °èla} q6m-ban7le b7°e dìye,} gu-""èšta šáwwa
yomàne,} ""ašír6t ràb°a-wawa Jazíre Bóta.} ‘She sent them to her and
people came and rebuilt his house, in six or seven days. Jazire Bota
was a large community (consisting of many people).’ (A26:59)
(22) xzéle b-xèlme dìye} ""í° xa-náša gu-d-áy mðìta} biš-f>qíra m-kúlla nàša.}
rába f>qìra-wewa ""awwa-náša.} ‘He saw in his dream that there was
a man in the town who was poorer than anybody else. The man
was very poor.’ (A8:3)
Constructions with postposed subjects such as (18)–(22) are typically used to
express an elaborative comment on something that has been talked about
in the immediately preceding discourse. They are intended to be cohesive
with what precedes more than with what follows. The subject is a topical
referent and not part of the information focus of the clause.
This construction is used also in clauses that repeat information that
has been given in what immediately precedes without advancing the discourse. This is the case in (23), where the postposed subject is placed in
a separate intonation group:the clause827(23) mèra g8r6g m7°6t sisisàmb6r.} sáw6n Tóma smèle, píšle kòra.} sisisàmb6r}
""ˆk5la?} k6s-Lelì°a.} ""áp-xa lá-maße má†e ""èlla dìya.} k6s-Lelì°5la} sisisàmb6r.}
‘They said “You must bring the sisisamb6r plant. Grandfather
Toma has become blind.” “Where is the sisisamb6r?” “With Leli°a.
Nobody can reach it. The sisisamb6r is with Leli°a.” ’ (A50:1)
When the referent of the subject constituent has been mentioned in the
immediately preceding discourse, the copula is occasionally placed on the
postposed subject rather than on the predicate. The copula in such cases
signals the topical prominence of the subject constituent, e.g.
(24) mère k yˆle qáßre díye?} . . . mère "">wà""ha qáßre díyele.} ‘He said “Where is
his residence?” . . . He said “His residence is that (over there).” ’
(A37:10)
The motivation for a construction with a postposed subject such as (24)
is again to signal cohesiveness with what precedes, in this case supplying
the answer to a preceding question. When, conversely, a topical subject
constituent occurs at the front of a clause, this typically expresses a less
cohesive connection with what precedes. As we have seen, the discourse
boundary marking function may be enhanced by increasing the coding
of the subject topic by means of the enclitic copula (14–16).
17.1.1.3. Split Predicate
When the predicate is a composite phrase consisting of several constituents, the copula is sometimes placed on the head of the predicate before
the dependent elements.
This is frequently the case when the head of the predicate is modified
by a dependent prepositional phrase, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)""áyya q7†5la †la-˙aywàne.} ‘This is (the activity of ) the summer for
the animals.’ (B5:112)
""Ón-Núne npílt5la l-†úra l-†ùra.} ""“n-Nune lies between one mountain
and another.’ (B5:148)
har-blíg6t b-kàsux.} ‘You are always concerned about your stomach.’
(A23:10)
""an-markáne mtúrßela m-""ùpra.} ‘The jars are made from clay.’
(B5:168)
""aw-zeðáya mtúrß5wa m-xê††e.} ‘The flat-bread was made out of wheat.’
(B5:15)828
(6)chapter seventeen
""ína ramán5wa biš-m6n-qáßr6t kùl-naše.} ‘But it was higher than the
villa of anybody (else).’ (B10:51)If the speaker wishes to give particular focal prominence to the dependent
prepositional phrase, this may be fronted before the head of the predicate
with the nuclear stress and copula placed on it, e.g.
(7)ßáw°a gu-púmm6t màr5la š6klánta.} ‘A word is beautiful (only) in the
mouth of its master (= It is easier said than done).’ (A26:40)The split of the predicate is regularly found when the head of the predicate
is a noun with a subordinate clause as its dependent, e.g.
(8)dán5la qá-t d5r7la m5rˆ°a.} ‘It is time to add the rennet.’ (B5:164)It is occasionally found in nominal annexation constructions, whereby the
copula is placed on the head noun, e.g.
(9) ""ána málk6n d-ày-ba≥6r.} ‘I am the king of that town.’ (A32:9)
(10) ""áwwa xa-nišànq5le} t-""á°‰a d-ˆ-ga.} ‘This was a symbolic act of our
country at that time.’ (B5:153)
In (9) the annexation particle is attached to a dependent phrase that begins
with a demonstrative and in (10) the particle is attached to a dependent
noun that is separated from its head by an intonation group boundary.
In both cases, therefore, the connection between the head and dependent
elements of the annexation are looser than in a construction in which the
annexation particle is suffixed to the head noun (k°aw6t qaša ‘the book of
the priest’). The copula does not split the head and dependent elements
in the latter type of tight annexation, e.g.
(11) ""ap-""ána brón6t màlk5w6n.} ‘I also am the son of a king.’ (A24:45)
(12) ‘ál°6t qáša Hˆdot?} ‘Are you the daughter-in-law of the priest H5do?’
(B9:10)
A copula normally intervenes between a head noun and an adjective only
when the adjective is in a separate intonation group. In such constructions
the adjective can be regarded as a reduced form of a separate predication
(see §14.7., examples 47–50), e.g.","[864, 865, 866, 867]"
"clause sequences933(1) r8pili m-an-képe t-íla tàma,} ga-maxz•nnux ""úrxa ßàl6t.} ‘Throw me the
stones that are there, then I shall show you the way down.’ (A14:70)
(2) híw5le xábra †la-d-àn maymúne} ga-wírra xa-xaðù°a gáwa.} ‘He gave word
to the monkeys and then they became very happy.’ (A14:47)
(3) ga-m•re mo-sùs5le?} ‘Then he said “What horse is it?” ’ (A12:62)
18.1.6.2. Introducing Comment
It may introduce a clause that presents a comment on what precedes.
This may be adversative in sense (1):
(1) lá-m6re b8ye xà°ux.} m•re b8ye Zìne.} ga-""7ni Zìne} ""áxni lˆð6x.} ‘He did not
say “He loves your sister.” He said “He loves Zine.” Now, we do not
know (by this statement) which Zine (was meant).’ (A26:61)
(2) m•re t-áz6x qa-xàz6x} Zíne ""5kˆla.} ga-l7ð6x ""5kˆla,} b-7ni dùk°5la,} ""7nila
""ùrxa.} ‘He said “We shall go to find where Zine is. But we do
not know where she is, in what place she is, what the road is.” ’
(A26:18)
18.1.6.3. Introducing Direct Speech
It is used at the beginning of direct speech, predominantly questions, e.g.
(1) m•ra ga-mo-xêðye b-áwwa dúša?} ‘They said “Why are we so happy
about this honey?” ’ (A14:15)
(2) m•re ga-béna ""ánna kúlla t-íla zála l7la mßáya b-an-""árbi bnà°a?} ‘He said
“Well, cannot all these people who are going (to fight) prevail against
the forty girls?” ’ (A12:58)
(3) m•re ga-mù} qwála †la-""alàha,} ya-""àlaha} m•re ""ána bêry6n?} ‘He said “Oh
Lord God,” he said complaining to God “Oh God, why was I
born?” ’ (A14:23)
(4) ""ám6r ga-kòra} ""ána mò yánnux?} ‘He said “Now, blind man, what can
I give you?” (A26:57)
(5) ""6n-mboqêrra m•nnux,} ""ánna d-ˆnila,} múr ga-""ánna t-""Ájd6n tèl5la.} ‘If they
ask you “Whose are these?”, say “Well, these belong to Ajd6n the
fox.” ’ (A32:17)
18.2. Negated Clauses
Here we shall examine two features of clause sequences containing
negated clauses.","[971, 972]"
"58chapter oneIn a few words, an originally emphatic letter is regularly pronounced
without velarization, e.g. kawsa ‘hair’ (cf. Syr. qawßtà ‘curl’), ""6sra ‘storage
basket’ (cf. Syr. ""awßrà). The loss of emphasis in ""6sra may have been motivated by a desire to distinguish the word from ""6ßra ‘ten’, in which, as we
have seen, the emphasis is an innovation.
1.4.4. Emphatic /‰/
A phonetic explanation can be found for the development of emphatic
/‰/ in some words.
It has sometimes arisen due to the original presence of the pharyngal
*', e.g.
""am‰a
se‰a
‰ay6š‘wool’
‘goat’s hair’
‘he wakes’< *'amrà
< *sa'rà
< *ra'6š < *ra8ešIt can also arise adjacent to a labial, e.g.
b6‰-naša
da‰mana‘human being’
‘medicine’In some minimal pairs in which /‰/ contrasts with /r/, the emphatic /‰/ is
a reflex of an originally geminated consonant, whereas the non-emphatic
/r/ is a reflex of a ungeminated consonant, e.g.
pa‰a
para‘lamb’
‘dust’< *parrà
< *""pàràma‰a
mara‘spade’
‘to say’< *marrà
< *""màràIn several cases, however, the emphatic /‰/ is not motivated primarily by
a phonetic cause but rather has developed as means of distinguishing a
word from a homophone with a different meaning, e.g.
bera
be‰a‘well’
‘light’< *b6""rà
< *b6hrànera
ne‰a‘river’
‘vision’< *nahrà
< *nahràconsonants59dare
da‰e‘he puts’
‘generations’< *dàrè
< *dàrèparma
øa‰ma‘she cuts’
‘type of oak tree’< *pàrmàThe is no phonetic reason why one member of these pairs should develop
the /‰/ rather than the other. Indeed some such pairs have a common
etymological root, e.g.
gawra
gaw‰a‘she marries’
‘man’< *gà∫rà
< *ga∫ràprama
ø‰ama‘to slaughter’
‘to understand’< *pràmà
< *pràmàA trend is discernible with regard to the distribution of this type of
emphatic /‰/ across word categories. Where a verb and a noun are
being distinguished by this means, it is the noun rather than the verb that
acquires the emphatic /‰/:
Verb
dare
parma
gawra
dwara‘he puts’
‘she cuts’
‘she marries’
‘threshing’Noun
da‰e
øa‰ma
gaw‰a
dwa‰a‘generations’
‘oak tree’
‘man’
‘rest area for sheep’1.4.5. Emphatic /ø/ and /¬/
The development of the marginal emphatic phonemes /ø/ and /¬/ has in
some cases been motivated by an etymological pharyngal *' in the word
in question, e.g.
¬aya
ø6qqa
mø>¬oye‘upper’
‘crack’
‘to imitate’< *'làyà
< *p6q'à
< *m-pl' < *m-pl8The word p6qqa ‘frog’ appears also to be derived from a form with
an original pharyngal (cf. Syr. peq'à, NENA C. Qaraqosh p6q""a). The
verb mø>¬oye, furthermore, appears to be a doublet of mp>loye ‘to share’
(< m-pl8). The absence of emphasis in these words is likely to be moti-60chapter onevated by the desire to distinguish them from ø6qqa ‘crack’ and mø>¬oye ‘to
imitate’ respectively.
The emphatic /ø/ in øa‰ma ‘type of oak tree’ and ø‰ama ‘to understand’
has developed as a means distinguishing the word from homophones of
different meaning, as is the case with the /‰/ in these words (cf. §1.4.4.).
1.4.6. Affricates /‘/, /ó/ and /j/ in Aramaic Words
As has been remarked in §1.2.1., the non-emphatic /‘/ occasionally occurs
in words by an advanced form of palatalization of /k/, e.g. ‘alo ‘bride’ <
kalo, ‘5rma ‘vineyard’ < k5rma. This, however, takes place only sporadically
and is not the normal form of these words, which are usually pronounced
with an initial palatalized velar, viz. kyalo, ky5rma.
The non-emphatic /‘/ in the verb ‘raxa ‘to surround’ may be derived
by advanced palatalization, if this root is derived historically from *krk
(cf. Syr. kra§). Unlike ‘alo and ‘5rma, the /‘/ here is a stable, fixed feature.
The development of the affricate may have been stimulated by the presence of an affricate at the beginning of the preposition ë6nn6k5r- ‘around’,
although the latter is of Kurdish origin. Another possible case of a /‘/
deriving by affrication from *k is the verb ‘yd ‘to invite’. This is likely to
have developed from a form with the preverbal particle k-, viz. *k-'yd, the
root of this being ultimately related to Syr. wa''ed ‘to invite’. This would
be a fossilized vestige of the k- prefixed particle, the ""i- prefix being the
normal indicative habitual particle in the C. Barwar dialect. In several
ˇiyare dialects other verbs have similar fossilized vestiges, e.g. ‘e ‘He knows’
< *k-ya≈6', ‘az6l ‘He goes’ < k-""az6l.3
Some cases of the non-emphatic affricate /‘/ have developed from a
fusion of *t and *š. This applies to ‘eri ‘autumn’ < *tšeri < *tešri and ""6‘‘a
‘nine’ (f.) < *""6tša' < *tša'. The /‘/ in the verb n‘ala ‘to pick (fruit, flowers),
to tear off ’ may also fall into this category, if the historical root of this
is identified as ntš (cf. Syr. ntaš ‘to pluck, to tear’) with the addition of a
non-etymological /l/. The affricate also in the verb m>‘oxe ‘to find’ should
be explained in this way, although the *š clustered originally with a *k
rather than with a *t in the root (cf. Syr. ""eška˙). It must be assumed that
the cluster *šk shifted to *št by partial assimilation of the velar *k to the
palato-alveloar *š. This is, indeed, what is found in the J. Urmi form of3See Talay (2008).","[96, 97, 98, 99]"
"the syntax of nominals455A noun of mass is given the particle when its description is delimited
by an attributive modifier of some kind and is thereby presented as one
member of a set of types, e.g.
(32) ""í°wa xa-""ùpra} m6šxàna,} ""úpra smòqa.} ‘There was an oily clay, red
clay.’ (B10:68)
(iv) Focus on unity
The particle is regularly used when the speaker wishes to give prominent
focus to the unity or uniqueness of the referent. This focus is expressed
on the prosodic level by putting the nuclear stress on the particle, e.g.
(33) ""í°wal6n šawwá ""abòne} gu-má°a dìy6n.} píšela mútte gu-Mar-Qiyóma kúlla
gu-ðà qáwra.} ‘We had seven bishops in our village. They were all
laid in one grave in (the church of) Saint Qiyoma.’ (B2:6)
(34) ""ána xà-yoma kèslux la-p7š6n.} ‘I won’t stay with you a single day
(longer).’ (A12:40)
(35) ""ána ðà-brat5n.} ‘I am an only daughter.’ (A34:7)
14.1.2.2. Particle Omitted
The indefinite marker tends to be omitted in the following circumstances, in
which the referent of the nominal is low in individuation and salience.
(i) Nominals with a referent that play an incidental role in text
Nominals often lack the indefinite marker when their referent does not
play a prominent, durable role in the text, but is only incidental and is
part of supportive background material. In (1), for example, the ‘old
man’ marked with the particle has a degree of durability of reference,
but the ‘load of wood’ that he was carrying and the ‘stone’ on which he
was stitting are incidental. Likewise in (2) the ‘basket’ in which the eggs
and bread were placed plays no significant role in the text. In all cases
the nominals have specific referents:
(1)xa-náša sàwa} ""úmre díye . . ., yá'ni dèqne díye m†áya l-9ra,} hóle †ína
k7rt6t qˆse} l-xàße.} hóle tíwa l-kèpa,} hàtxa.} ""ánna pìð6lla mênne díye,}
""ap-šlàma l7la dèry6lle.} ‘An old man, whose age . . . that is his beard
reached the ground, was carrying a load of wood on his back.
He was sitting on a stone, like this. They passed by him, but did
not even greet him.’ (A15:13)456chapter fourteen(2) mšádr6n m5xòlta ""èlle díye,} ""ixàla.} qìmt5la,} šlìqta} bè""e,} šàwwa bé""e.}
""u-mutt7°5la †¬á°i lêxme} gu-‘ànta.} mêra bábi náb6lla gu-jàma} hàlle!} ‘ “I
shall send food to him, some food.” She boiled eggs, seven eggs,
and put thirty loaves of bread in a basket. She said “Father, take
them to the mosque and give them to him.” ’ (A17:11)
The omission of the particle with the word m6ndi ‘thing’ can be explained
in the same way in (3) and (4), where it refers to something that is incidental and not referred to in what follows. By contrast in (5) and (6), where
m6ndi has the particle, it refers to something that is talked about in the
ensuing discourse:
(3) ""á°6t ""ána mbàšl6n mèndi.} ‘Come and I shall cook something.’
(A22:14)
(4) tìwle,} xílle mêndi} ‘He sat down and ate something.’ (A15:1)
(5) ""ána ""áxxa nšéli xa-mêndi.} ‘I have forgotten something here.’ (The
speaker then goes on to talk about the thing he had forgotten to
mention earlier) (B5:35)
(6) ""ám6r ""èlla dìya} t-amrênn6x xa-mêndi.} mèra mùr.} ‘He said to her “I
shall tell you something.” She said “Tell (me).” ’ (A16:7)
In some cases the particle is omitted before a nominal with a referent that
has a certain durability in the ensuing clauses of a section of discourse,
but lacks textual salience due to the fact that the section of discourse in
question is not in the foreground of the disourse as a whole, but supplies
background information. This applies to (7), in which the ‘lion’ clearly
plays a dominant role in the chain of clauses that is cited, but these are
not in the main foreground of the narrative, but rather provide explanatory background information as to how the protagonist of the section
lost his hand:
(7) zílle xa-béna ""árya °éle †álbe dìye,} ""áwwa q†ìlle †la-""árya,} ""ína ""árya ""íðe
díye q6m-axêlla.} ‘A lion once attacked him. He killed the lion, but
the lion ate his hand.’ (A11:1)
(ii) Listing members of a set
In contexts where a member of a set is presented as one of a list of many
rather than being presented in distinct opposition to another member, the
particle is sometimes omitted, e.g.","[493, 494, 495]"
"the clause891(1) xo-là p7š6n š>vána-llux.} ‘I shall not become a shepherd for you.’
(A25:32)
(2) ""áxni b>yèxwa t-a°êxwa.} xu-là-mßaya t-a°èxwa t-amrèxwal6x.} ‘We wanted
to come back, but we could not come back to tell you.’ (A14:21)
(3) yába ""an-""èmma dàwe,} xu-là mbaqrêt6lli.} ‘Well, do not ask me about
those hundred gold coins.’ (A14:65)
17.7.14.2. Negative Particle before Other Constituents
The negative particle is sometimes placed before another component of
the clause that intervenes before the verb. This is found in the following
circumstances:
(i) Verb Not in Scope of Negation
One context where this is found is where the scope of the negator
includes this item but not the verb. In order for it to be within the scope
of the negation, it must be in the focus component of the clause. There
is, therefore, a narrow focus on the negated item, with the verb being in
the presupposition. The nuclear stress is sometimes, though not regularly,
placed on the negator before the item in narrow focus, as in (1)–(4):
(1) xzèla} ""ína núra †èpya b-b7°e dìye,} ""ína là-b5°a qíða,} xá‘‘a q7se rè˙qa m6nbˆ°e.} ‘They saw that fire had been kindled in his house, but his
house had not burnt down, only a few sticks far from his house
(had burnt).’ (A48:3)
(2) ""è°yela hìw6lla} ""áy mèra lˆk6t naból6lli?} mère ""ána làn †láli naból6ll6x.}
naból6ll6x †la-d-áwwa dewêrr6š.} ‘She said “Where are you taking me?”
He said “I am not taking you for myself. I am taking you for this
vagabond.” ’ (A12:35)
(3) là-kulley yapáwa.} ‘Not all of them used to bake.’ (B5:17)
(4) ""áx‘i là gu-""Ôn6 Núne q6m-""oðènne ""éða,} q6m-""oðènwale gu-Dòhok.} ‘But I did
not spend the festival in ""“n-Nune, I spent it in Dohok.’ (B15:9)
(5) lá kulla-náše y8ði t-oðìla.} ‘Not all people know how to make it.’
(B10:22)
(6) ""áxni lá raba-""i-map6lxêxwala.} ‘We do not use it much.’ (B10:18)
(7) ""ilan5ni t-xabušta. m-reša-w š6tta mnoqašta. l-Yaws6p zwinta b-dabašta. nèmu
""áxni xlúl6t Gwèrg6s la-xálti zwínna kéke dìye} mèra ða-dabàšta?} ‘ “Our
tree is an apple tree. It is decorated above and below. It has been
bought by Yaws6p for a beehive.” [wedding song] At the wedding
of Gw6rg6s was it not my aunt who bought his cake and say “(I
buy it) for a beehive?” ’ (B8:29–30)
(8) xo-lán har-""ána gàw‰a.} ‘I am not the only man.’ (A26:79)892chapter seventeenConstructions such as (9) and (10), in which the verb has been gapped,
can be included here:
(9)""áni maßlèxwa ""êrxe,} †axnêxwala.} là kúlla náše.} bas-""àxni.} ‘We brought
them down to the water-mill and ground them. Not everybody,
but we did (this).’ (B10:88)
(10) mattátla xa-kawáz6t míya k6s-réša-w bàs,} la-""ixàla,} la-lêxma.} ‘You should
put out for her a jar of water by her head and that’s all, not food,
nor bread.’ (A21:10)In (11) the item in the scope of negation is placed after the verb, with the
negative particle used both before this item and the verb:
(11) lá d5r7le là r6š-séla} ""i-maxíle gu-tanùra.} ‘They do not place it on a
griddle, they place it in the oven.’ (B6:49)
(ii) Constituents Coordinated in a Set Relation
The negative particle is placed before a subject constituent when the latter
is placed at the front of a clause in order to establish it in a set relationship
with an item in a coordinated adjacent clause and the scope of negation
includes the subject, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)la-k yàsa m>ráwa} ""u-la-xàßa m>réwa,} la-∂á©a† y-awèwale.} ‘(One’s) stomach did not ache, (one’s) back did not ache and one did not have
(high blood) pressure.’ (B5:31)
""ána lˆ-gor6n,} la-""àti gáwr6t.} ‘I shall not marry, so long as you do not
marry.’ (A25:83)
la-""áxnix xàla} ""u-lá sus>wà°6n xála.} ‘Neither are we eating nor are
our horses eating.’ (A26:16)If the items that are coordinated in a set relationship across a series of
two or more clauses are not subject constituents, a second negator is often
placed before the item in question, in addition to a negator in the normal
position in the clause, e.g.
(4)lá-karmi l5le-m>dò‰e} ""u-la-˙áqq6t kàrmi l5le-yáwa.} ‘He does not return
my orchard nor does he pay the price.’ (A17:30)Constituents that are coordinated in this way include the resultative participle and infinitive of compound verbal constructions, e.g.","[929, 930, 931]"
"12introductionThe C. Barwar dialect has two types of compound verbal forms. One
combines the resultative participle (q†ila) with the copula to express the
perfect (§15.4.1.). The other combines the infinitive with the copula to
express progressive aspect (§8.8.5.–8.8.7.). Both of these constructions are
innovative developments in NENA that appear to have been induced by
contact with other languages. C. Barwar shares these features with the local
dialects and also some other dialects in the peripheral group. The compound
verbal forms, however, exhibit different properties across the subgroups
of dialects that possess them. One difference is the way the pronominal object is expressed. In C. Barwar and the local group of dialects it
is expressed with suffixes that are used to mark the object on other verbal
forms (§8.19.4.1., §8.19.4.4.). Most other dialects use the form of suffix
that is attached to nouns. Table 3 shows the distribution of the compound
forms and the form of pronominal object across the dialects.

—The expression of the perfect by a compound construction consisting of
the resultative participle (q†ila) and the copula is widespread across the
NENA group, but is not found in the north-western periphery (Bohtan
and Hertevin) or in the south-eastern periphery (Sanandaj). This suggests that it is an innovation of the other dialects. The compound verbal
construction consisting of an infinitive and copula for the expression of
the progressive aspect is also an innovation that is not found in Bohtan,
Hertevin and Sanandaj. Its distribution, however, is less widespread thanintroduction13the resultative participle construction. It is not found in Qaraqosh, nor
in various other dialects in the southern half of the NENA area in the
Arbìl and Sulemaniyya provinces of Iraq (e.g. Ankawa, Shaqlawa, villages
in the region of Aqra, B6dj6l, Koy Sanjak, Sulemaniyya), all of which
express the progressive with constructions based on the present base of
the verb (qa†6l ).24
The close relationship of C. Barwar with the local group of dialects is
reflected also in shared lexical items that are not used across the entire
NENA group. A few representative examples are given in table 4:

It exhibits the greatest affiliation with dialects in the region of the northeastern periphery. These relationships are reflected most clearly in the

15.14. Indirect Objects
A nominal that has the function of the indirect object of an action, i.e.
one that refers to a participant who is a recipient or beneficiary in the
action, is expressed by attaching the preposition †la-/ta- or qa-. Unlike
direct object nominals, indirect object nominals normally do not have
any agreement element in the form of a pronominal copy on the verb,
even when the noun is definite, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l têrte tawriyá°a.} ‘He will give to your neighbour
two cows.’ (A3:4)
tèmm6l t-ámr6n ta-bàbi.} ‘Tomorrow I shall tell my father.’ (A18:7)
mèrt5la †la-d-áw-naša sáwa puš-b-šˆna!} ‘She said to that old man
“Remain in peace!” ’ (A8:69)On some rare occasions an agreement L-suffix is attested on the verb,
e.g.
(4)""ána t-àz6n} tanyánne ða-tuní°a †la-màlka.} ‘I shall go and tell a story
to the king.’ (A36:2)the syntax of verbs787As already described in §8.19.5., a pronominal indirect object of a verb
may be expressed by an L-suffix or by an independent prepositional phrase
consisting of the prepositions ""6ll-, †la- or qa- and a pronominal suffix. With
past base verbs the pronominal indirect object may also be expressed by
the inflection of the past base, e.g. mirále ‘He said to her’. Here we shall
examine in greater detail the distribution of these alternative devices in
the text corpus.
When there is no direct object, the pronominal indirect object may
usually be expressed either by an L-suffix or by an independent prepositional phrase. In such cases the ‘heavier’ prepositional phrase tends to be
used at the end of an intonation group (7–9) and avoided in the middle
of an intonation group following the verb (5–6). Included here are verbs
of saying followed by direct or indirect speech:
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)""álaha yállux b-àyya dúnye} ""u-b-5-xèta.} ‘May God grant you (bounty)
in this world and the next.’ (A21:44)
xáli lá ""amrètli qèßß6t d-áwwa qáßra mòdila?} ‘Uncle, will you not tell
me what the story of this palace is?’ (A25:67)
""ám6r ""èlle dìye.} ‘He says to him.’ (A21:2)
t-ámreti †làli.} ‘Tell me.’ (A21:43)
""ána mar6n-êllux.} ‘I say to you.’ (A17:34)A compound verbal form consisting of a resultative participle or an
infinitive without a clitic copula never takes L-suffixes. It usually takes a
cliticized ""6ll-phrase, e.g. hon híw6lle ‘I have given to him’, hon yaw6lle ‘I am
giving to him’. At the end of an intonation group this may be replaced
by an independent prepositional phrase with its own stress, e.g.
(10) hóle mára †làli.} ‘He says to me.’ (A17:10)
(11) ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi.} ‘She has been given to me.’ (A25:39)
When the verb has both a pronominal direct object and a pronominal
indirect object, the direct object is normally the primary object affix on
the verb and the indirect object is expressed by a prepositional adjunct
phrase, which in most cases follows the direct object affix, e.g.
(12) xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa} ""u-t-yáxla ""èlle dìye.} ‘Let’s look for a
man who is a hard worker and give her to him.’ (A21:3)
(13) ""ána t-yànna-llux.} ‘I shall give them to you.’ (A12:2)788chapter fifteen(14) á¬óla sámma-w hallùle-lle.} ‘Fill it with poison and give it to him.’
(A26:86)
(15) b-zabnètle ""èlli ""6n-háwe b-ðà-""aqla?} ‘Will you sell it to me if it has one
leg?’ (A22:5)
(16) xúwwe mà t-áw6ð b-an-álpa dáwe,} t-áz6n hawènna ""6lle-dìye?!} ‘What will
the snake do with the thousand gold coins that I should go and
give them to him?!’ (A1:8)
(17) xà°i,} Zìne,} hiwála ""êlli.} ‘My sister, Zine gave it to me.’ (A26:38)
(18) ""ána t-amrênna-llux.} ‘I shall tell it to you.’ (A21:35)
When the verb has a definite direct object nominal, this generally takes
an agreement in the form of a direct object pronominal affix and a pronominal indirect object must be expressed by an independent prepositional
phrase, which generally follows, e.g.
(19) bas-yátla Náze ""êlli.} ‘But you must give Naze to me.’ (A25:23)
(20) qá-mo le-yátla xá°ux ""êlle?} ‘Why won’t you give your sister to him?’
(A26:72)
(21) ""ána sámi t-yánne †lalˆxu.} ‘I shall give my portion to you.’ (A21:29)
(22) t8ra la-pa°xètle ""èlle dìye.} ‘Do not open the door to him.’ (A23:25)
(23) ""áwwa yála yíw6lle ""álaha ""èlla díya ""6štà yárxe.} ‘God gave them this
child six months ago.’ (A15:9)
In (24) there is a deviation from this usual rule, in that the indirect pronominal object is expressed by an L-suffix on the verb before the L-suffix
that agrees with the direct object nominal:
(24) hállila masr6q°ònti} ‘Give me my little comb’ (A34:3)
Occasionally a textually prominent indefinite direct object nominal takes
an agreement pronoun, e.g.
(25) ""áp-""awwa šaqèlla ðá-k6sta qa-d-ày,} yawèlla qa-d-ày.} ‘He also takes a
purse for her and gives it to her.’ (A4:22)
When a direct object nominal has no object agreement on the verb, the
pronominal indirect object is the primary affix on the verb, which is an
L-suffix in verb forms that take L-suffixes. The main circumstances in which
the direct object agreement element is omitted include the following:the syntax of verbs789(i) An indefinite direct object nominal
(26) ya-""alàha,} yawètl6n xa-bròna.} ‘Oh God, give us a son.’ (A15:17)
(27) hállule xa-sùsa.} ‘Give him a horse.’ (A12:59)
(28) mattúli xá-š6mma xèna.} ‘Give me another name.’ (A7:2)
(29) q7m6n šaqlènni xákma mèndi mènni b-""ìði.} ‘I shall get up and take for
myself a few things, with me in my hand.’ (A23:5)
(30) b>yánni ""èmma bnà°a.} ‘I want for myself a hundred girls.’ (A25:74)
(ii) A definite direct object that is an inalienable possession or closely
associated appurtenance of the referent of the indirect object
(31) híw6lla jùlla.} ‘He gave her clothes to her.’ (A14:84)
(32) hot-yàw6lle rèsqe díye} hóle xàla.} ""áp-""ana ßál6n dámx6n bˆ°a.} ""áti májbur
t-yàtli rèsqi.} ‘You are giving to it its sustenance and it is eating it. I
also shall go down and sleep at home. You will be obliged to give
me my sustenance.’ (A10:3)
(iii) A definite nominal that is a narrow focus
Agreement with a definite direct object is omitted on the verb if the object
constitutes a narrow focus which does not include the verb. The focus may
be a new information focus, in which case the verb is in the presupposition
of the clause, or the focus may be one of prominence, in which case the
verb may be new information but is of reduced prominence, e.g.
(33) har-t-yàtli ða-bráta,} là?} mère hè.} mère yátli S6ttìye.} mère ma-yxàl6f,} t-yánnux S6ttìye.} ‘ “You will still give me a daughter, is that not so?’ ” He
said “Yes.” He said “You should give me S6ttiye (rather than one of
the others).” He said “Fine. I’ll give you S6ttiye.” ’ (A25:25)
(34) ""aláha hóle yíw6lli ""áyya ""ùrxa.} ‘God has given me this way.’ (A21:42)
Even when there is no direct object agreement suffix on the verb, the
indirect object can be expressed by an independent prepositional phrase.
This is found at the close of an intonation group to act as end-weighting, e.g.
(35) hátta m5xólta b-kàwe dár6x ""6lle-díye.} ‘We even give food to it through
the window.’ (A12:62)790chapter fifteenIt is also found where the speaker fronts the phrase to give the indirect
object prominence in order to set it in contrastive opposition to an indirect
object in an adjacent clause, e.g.
(36) ""6n-†lálux yáw6l xà xmára} ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l trè xmáre.} ‘If he gives to
you one ass, he will give to your neighbour two asses.’ (A3:4)
(37) ""u-†lálux lan-šwíqa ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘I have left nothing for you (whereas I
have taken everything for myself ).’ (A2:11)
At the end of a discourse unit the long alternative type of suffix construction for the expression of an indirect object is occasionally used on
compound verbal forms, whereby the copula element is placed after the
pronominal suffix. For the use of this construction with direct object suffixes for end-weighting see §15.13.5.:
(38) ""6n-mjuwêbla,} xo-""àn6n ""è°ya kêsl6x.} ""6n-là mjuwèbla,} ""àtit °í°a kêsli.}
qrí°5la qála b-Šál6m ""u-Sùrma,} ‘u-jwába la-yìw6ll5la.} [< yiwa + 6lla
(3fs. indirect object) + ila (3pl. copula)] ‘ “If they answer you, then
indeed it is me who has come to you. If they do not answer you,
you have come to me.” She called Šalem and Surma, but they
did not give her any reply.’ (A26:4–5)
If a past base verb is used in the clause, an indirect pronominal object
tends to be expressed by an independent prepositional phrase in all circumstances, e.g.
(39) yíwla xa-q7sa xéna ""èlle dìye.} ‘She gave another stick to him.’
(A22:29)
(40) ""ím6t ""aláha yíwle ""6lléy bròna} ‘When God gave them a son . . .’
(A15:17)
(41) mêre ""èlle díye} ‘He said to him’ (A17:4)
(42) mère †làli} ‘He said to me’ (A22:8)
(43) hàtxa mjuwèble ""èlli málka.} ‘The king replied to me thus.’ (A17:34)
(44) wídla f†árta ""êlli.} ‘She made breakfast for me.’ (A21:35)CHAPTER SIXTEENTHE SYNTAX OF PREPOSITIONS
The morphology and basic uses of the prepositions have been described
in §13.3. In this chapter we shall take a closer look at the syntax and
semantic range of the main prepositions, particularly those that have
multiple functions.
16.1. BThe preposition b- has a variety of uses. When it takes pronominal suffixes, these are attached to a longer base with the form biy-.
16.1.1. Spatial and Temporal Location
It may express location in a perceptible space in contexts such as the
following:
(1) šqíl5le q7sa b-""íðe dìye.} ‘He took the stick in his hand.’ (A22:30)
(2) ""o-yála zóra hóla mútt6lle be-pàlga.} ‘They put the small child in the
middle.’ (A4:58)
(3) w-ána b-ánna dašdàše-w} b-ánna ‘akàlle-w} ‘while I am in these plain
clothes and slippers’ (A6:7)
(4) šwíq6lla xáye bìy6x.} ‘He has left his life (which remained to him) in
you.’ (A4:42)
The preposition gu- is far more commonly used to express location within
an enclosed physical space, e.g. gu-xa-g6ppì°a} ‘in a cave’ (A15:1), gu-jˆbe}
‘in his pocket’ (A15:2), gu-Kàrkuk} ‘in Kirkuk’ (A16:1), gu-ða-mà°a} ‘in a
village’ (A48:1), gu-dudìya ‘in the cradle’ (A15:8). When the preposition
b- is used to refer to location in a physical space, this is generally less
physically enclosed, as in (1)–(4). It is more frequently used for location
in an abstract space, e.g. b-š7na b-†awà°a} ‘(You have come) in peace and
blessings’ (A15:8), b-xèlmi} ‘in my dream’ (A1:2), b-šóp6t bròn6n} ‘in the place
of our son’ (A4:39). The preposition b- expresses location within a state792chapter sixteenor activity in progressive constructions with infinitives, e.g. hóle b-°áya ‘He
is coming’ (A13:14), and occasionally other nouns.
It is used when a lesser degree of enclosure than in (1)–(4) is involved,
such that there is only surface contact, e.g. b-""ùrxa} ‘on the road’ (A15:1),
b-rèšux} ‘on your head’ (A23:8), b-miya šaxine ‘by warm waters’ (C2:54),
b-qðàli} ‘on my neck’ (A21:27).
In some cases it is used in an ingressive (5–8) or occasionally egressive
(9) sense:
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)míya ßèlyela b-rešèy.} ‘The water came down onto their heads.’
(A16:11)
síqela b-xa-†ùra.} ‘They went up onto a mountain.’ (A17:4)
drí°a xêppo b-réša.} ‘She had put a veil on her head.’ (A19:2)
npílt5la b-xùbba.} ‘She has fallen in love.’ (A4:14)
mèšx6t qálya plí†le b-jebàne díye.} ‘The oil of the roast meat came out
of his pockets.’ (A23:9)The preposition gu- is likewise used in an ingressive or egressive sense,
e.g.
(10) wìrela gu-b7°a.} ‘They entered the house.’ (A15:7)
(11) zílela gu-ða-má°a xèta.} ‘They went into another village.’ (A15:10)
(12) síqela gu-xa-†ùra.} ‘They went up into a mountain.’ (A15:13)
(13) zèdy6lla gu-ða-dˆrta.} ‘They threw it into a house enclosure.’
(A15:12)
(14) šár†6n gu-""i°á°6 d-áwwa nàša.} ‘so that I escape from the hands of
this man.’ (A31:3)
(15) ""áti pál†6t gu-d-ànna.} ‘You should depart from these people.’
(A12:5)
Various nouns are used with b- in some contexts and with gu- in others,
as can be seen in the examples cited above. This should not necessarily
be interpreted as complete functional overlap, but rather is likely to reflect
different conceptualizations of the degree of enclosure involved, e.g.
b-xa-†ùra} ‘onto a mountain’ (A17:4)
gu-xa-†ùra} ‘into a mountain’ (A15:13)
gu-jˆbe} ‘in his pocket (hidden)’ (A15:2)
b-jebàne díye} ‘(from) in his pockets (revealed)’ (A23:9)the syntax of prepositions793b-""íðe dìye} ‘in his hand’ (A22:30)
gu-""i°á°6 ‘(from) in his hands (trapped)’ (A31:3).
The place through which one passes is also marked by b-, e.g.
(16) b-t8ra wìrt5la.} ‘It (the cat) entered by the door.’ (A23:19)
(17) táwre morètla b-kàwe.} ‘You should bring the oxen in through the
window.’ (A30:22)
The preposition b-, rather than gu-, is used to express location in a time
period, e.g. b-áyya dána ‘at this time’ (A15:7), b-lˆle ‘at night’ (A15:8), b-lˆle
b-yòma} ‘night and day’ (A21:2), b-""aßêrta} ‘in the evening’ (A22:31), b-q7†a
‘in the summer’ (B5:19), b-xarˆ°a} ‘at last’ (A22:5).
16.1.2. Instrument
It is often used in relation to the instrument or means by which an action
is performed. The complement is usually an inanimate object or a part
of the body, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)b-o n9ra} ""an-táwre dìye} mqudêqd5lel5y.} ‘He chopped the oxen up with
the axe.’ (A30:23)
xzáy6t6lla b-dùrbin.} ‘You see it with binoculars.’ (A25:52)
b6rzóma yá'ni ta-t-ßáli gu-gòma,} b-semàlta} ‘a hatch for them to go
down into the basement stable, by a ladder’ (A23:28)
zríy6nwale b-i°à°i.} ‘I had cultivated it with my hands.’ (A17:32)
""áyya kúlla q6m-max6rwàla} b-aqlá°a dìya.} ‘This (cat) has spoilt everything with its feet.’ (A23:19)Occasionally the complement is an animate referent, e.g.
(6)súq m7°i qˆsa biyéy.} ‘Go up and fetch wood with them (the asses).’
(A23:34)The expression waða b-xabra ‘to do by, according to the word (of so-andso)’ belongs here, e.g.
(7)""u-""èdyo ""áti lat-wáða b-xàbri.} ‘Today you are not doing as I say.’
(A21:43)794chapter sixteenUnder this head can be included phrases with the base b-gan- ‘by oneself ’,
e.g.
(8)ma-lat-ðáya b-gán6x qàr°5la?} ‘Don’t you know yourself that it is cold?’
(A20:1)
(9) wídla ""ixála ""áy b-gàna.} ‘She made the food by herself.’ (A21:40)
(10) y8ð6t b-gànux.} ‘You know by yourself.’ (A1:11)
Here also belong multiplicative expresses such as:
(11) ""áxni t-yawèxla xa-b-†¬à°a ""èlle díye.} ‘We shall give him threefold (if
it is lost).’ (A7:10)
16.1.3. ‘with’
On a number of occasions it is appropriate to translate the preposition
by English ‘with’. The relation may be comitative, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)""á°i b-dáwla-w zórna-w tópe-w ‘Let them come with the drum and
pipe and with guns.’ (A4:33)
xáz6x ßèly5le b-xà †ena ""èxre} ""u-°éle b-†¬á°a †ène.} ‘We see that he went
down with one saddle bag of excrement and he has come back
with three saddle bags.’ (A7:12)
""ánna ma-t-íla xmíle b-©ðàðe!} ‘How happy they were with each other
(= together)!’ (A4:50)
""áyya bráta la-p7ša bìyux.} ‘This girl will not remain with you.’
(A29:33)
""i-xo†íla b-mêšxa.} ‘They mix them with oil.’ (B6:51)
""an-tre-maláxe t-w7wa ""è°ye bìya} ‘those two angels who had come with
her (= had brought her)’ (A4:44)It is also used to express various other types of association or linkage,
e.g.
(7)
(8)lìtl6n šúla bíye.} ‘We have no business with it (= It is not our business).’ (A48:6)
""aláha hole-mìra} t-yawêllux} b-šàr†} kú-mdit yawêllux} ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l
trè.} ‘God has said that he will give to you with the condition that
everything he gives to you he will give to your neighbour twofold.’
(A3:4)the syntax of prepositions795(9)""ána xa-náša gò‰5w6n,} wíra b-šênne.} ‘I am an old man, advanced in
age.’ (A8:43)
(10) mol6xmáli . . . ""áyya zmárta bíye dìye.} ’I composed this song about him.’
(C4:2)
(11) naša go‰a b-š6nne ‘a man big with regard to years (= an elderly
man)’16.1.4. Attributive
The preposition sometimes has the function of linking a referent to a
nominal that is presented as an attribute, in that it constitutes a component or property of it. e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)m6n-d-ànna} pazesór b-""6lyà°a,} hátxa b-qanàne} ‘Some of those big sheep
with fat tails and horns (big) like this’ (A7:22)
""ána làn b-xá-reša} b-šàwwa reš>wá°6n.} ‘I do not have just one head,
I have seven heads.’ (A24:41)
""ána b-zawnènne ""6n-háwe b-tèrte ""aqlà°a.} ‘I shall buy it if it has two
legs.’ (A22:9)
w-aßèrta m5°êtli} xá-qapla qˆse} t-lá-hawa b-qàlpe.} ‘In the evening bring
me a bundle of pieces of wood that are without bark.’ (A30:6)
wél6x hawnànta,} b-""iqár6t ßáw°a basìmta,} ""u-màqul.} ‘You have been
clever, with the honour of sweet and fine words.’ (A40:16)
b-ràxme!} ‘(May you be) with mercy! (= Bless you!)’ (A4:60)
†¬á-mma xatáne b-xa xerìya.} ‘Three hundred ladies with one veil.’
(D1:9)
barða b-qanane ‘hail with horns (= heavy hail)’We should classify here attributive expressions such as the following:
b-xamme ‘sad’, b-xaye ‘alive’, b-†ali ‘ill’, b-palxana ‘busy’ (§11.7.).
16.1.5. Material
It is occasionally used to denote the material out of which something is
made, e.g.
(1)t-oðètli gèšra b-qˆsa.} ‘Make me a bridge of wood.’ (A17:18)796chapter sixteen16.1.6. Price
It denotes the price at which an item is fixed either in an amount of
money or a bartered object, e.g.
(1) xá-kilo ""èxre b-†¬á°a dàw5le.} ‘One kilo of dung sells for three gold
pieces.’ (A7:14)
(2) ""ána zonènna b-""êßra.} ‘I shall buy it for ten (dinars).’ (B5:42)
(3) xál6t xètna q6m-zawènna ""ilána b-xamšì dináre.} ‘The maternal uncle of
the groom has bought it (the tree) for a hundred dinars.’ (B15:68)
(4) l-Yaws6p zwinta b-neriya. ‘It has been bought by Yaws6p for a male
goat.’ (B8:28)
Conversely it is used before the item sold in expressions such as (5):
(5) y-a°éwa zonàna,} y-amêrwa} ""àyya} ""àtxa b-yawènnux bíya díya.} ‘A purchaser
would come and say “I shall give you such-and-such (an amount
of money) for them (the apples).” ’ (B15:52)
16.1.7. Manner
It may express the manner in which an action is performed. In such cases
it is generally combined with an abstract nominal, e.g.
(1) maßl7l6n b-iqàra.} ‘They bring us down with honour.’ (A4:30)
(2) b8y6n lá-""a°i b-xàšša.} ‘I do not want them to come in sadness.’
(A4:33)
(3) ""áni b-x7la b8yi mbarxíla ""êlli.} ‘They want to marry her to me by
force.’ (A7:18)
(4) bás ""amrêtli} b-duzù°a} dàx ""áyya bráta wiðálux brát6t b7°a.} ‘Just tell me,
in truth, how have you made this girl a housewife.’ (A21:34)
16.1.8. Causal Background
Occasionally it expresses the cause or purpose of an action, e.g.
(1) ""ám6r b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Was it for this (reason) you sent for me?’
(A21:32)
(2) zílle b-ríx6t k>bàbe,} xzéle mdaxóye xmàre.} ‘He went after the smell of
kebabs, but he found the branding of asses.’ (D2:30)the syntax of prepositions797(3) l7w6t ""àti} ""5-bráta t-in-""ána wíð6lla gáni kóra b-rèš6x,} mèxy6lla ""urêdxa}
gu-""ˆni?} ‘Are you not the girl on account of whom I made myself
blind, by puttinng the needle into my eye?’ (A16:7)
16.1.9. Oath
The preposition is used in oaths or adjurations before the item by which
the speaker is swearing, e.g.
(1) mèra b-rèšux.} ""áti mútt6t-6lle tàma.} ‘She said “(I swear) by your head.
You put him there.” ’ (A22:39)
The preposition is most frequently used with this function before the
noun ""alaha ‘God’ in the phrase b-álaha, which is usually stressed on the
first syllable and often pronounced [b-a[la]. This expression is used in a
variety of contexts. In general it strengthens an assertion, by committing
the speaker fully to the truth of the statement, e.g.
(2) b-álaha ""áwwa xoš-yàl5le.} ‘By God, he is a good lad.’ (A21:5)
(3) b-álaha d°s-it.} ‘By God, you are right.’ (A17:19)
It is often used to introduce the response to a question, e.g.
(4) ""o-tèla} mère há lˆk6t zála,} ya-gáni dêbba?} b-álaha xðár6n bá°6r rêsqi.} ‘The
fox said “Hey, where are you going, my dear bear?” “By God, I’m
looking for my sustenance.” ’ (A20:1)
(5) há bròni,} m-ˆk6t °áya?} b-álaha m-bˆ°6n °áya,} ""àmti.} ‘‘ ‘Hey, my son,
where are you coming from?” “By God, I’m coming from home,
aunt.” ’ (A23:2)
(6) mèra mòdila qèßß6t díya?} mère b-álaha qèßß6t díya hàtx5la.} ‘She said “What
is her story?” He said “By God, her story is like this.” ’ (A4:14)
It is used to strengthen a remonstration expressed by a negative question,
e.g.
(7) b-álaha látwa mìrta} la-h7w6n ""u-lá b6‰-náša ""áw6r gu-""òt6x?} ‘By God, did
you not say that no animal and no person should enter the room?’
(A23:22)798chapter sixteen16.1.10. Complements of Verbs and Expressions
The preposition b- is used as the complement of some verbs, e.g. dbaša
b- ‘to stick to’, dqara b- ‘to touch’, mbaxole b- ‘to envy’, mhaymone b- ‘to
believe in’, mparoje b- ‘to look at’, tfaqa b- ‘to meet’, †paya b- ‘to catch
onto (fire)’, parpore b- ‘to plead to’, qya°a b- ‘to hit’, tpara b- ‘to threaten’,
xðaya b- ‘to rejoice in’, xkaka/gxaka b- ‘to laugh at’, xqara b- ‘to honour’,
xyara b- ‘to look at’. It is also used as the obligatory complement of some
attributive expressions, e.g. bista b- ‘familiar with’, bliga b- ‘busy with’, x6ðya
b- ‘pleased with’.
Several verbs may take a direct object complement or a complement
introduced by the preposition b-. In general the construction with the
prepositional complement is used to express a situation in which the action
affects the referent to a lesser extent than when a direct complement is
used, or a situation in which the action is less directly associated with the
referent. Some pairs are given below by way of illustration:
ðaya + object ‘to know, understand (sth., so. by direct knowledge)’, ðaya
b-‘to know about (sth. so. indirectly)’, e.g.
(1) y6ðènne ""á°‰6t bàbi.} ‘I know the land of my father.’ (A14:90)
(2) hé b-àlaha,} qídle b7°6t duglàna-w} ""áxni là-ðiye bíye.} ‘Oh, by God, the
house of the liar has burnt down, without us knowing about it.’
(A48:7)
mxaya + object ‘to strike’, mxaya b- ‘to play (a musical instrument)’, e.g.
(3) lá maxênn6x.} ‘I shall not strike you.’ (A51:19)
(4) ""Ašeba†àlo} ""áwwa máxe b-zòrna.} ‘Ašeba†alo played the pipe’ (A25:26)
mšaxlope + object ‘to change’, mšaxlope b- ‘to exchange’, e.g.
(5) ta-mšaxèlpi šèmm6t ’ùxo} ‘in order for them to change the name ’uxo’
(A7:3)
(6) mšuxlèpla b-is6qyà°a.} ‘They exchanged rings.’ (A4:5)
zmara + object ‘to sing (a song)’, zmara b- ‘to sing to (so.)’, e.g.
(7) ""i-zamríwa ràwe.} ‘They used to sing rawe.’ (B15:75)
(8) zmírre b-Zìne.} ‘He sang to Zine.’ (A25:22)the syntax of prepositions799xala + object ‘to eat (completely)’, xala b- ‘to eat (parts of sth.)’, e.g.
(9) xílela xa-ràmša.} ‘They ate dinner.’ (A16:9)
(10) ""u-rípel6lle kùlla,} nyása-w xàla ""èbbe-diye.} ‘They (the animals) all
attacked him, biting and eating bits of him (= gnawing him).’
(A35:21)
Some verbs can take a direct object or another preposition but use b- before
a referent that is disadvantaged in some way by the action, e.g.
(11) †la-mò wídlux hátxa bíyi?} ‘Why have you done this to me?’
(A15:14)
(12) xzi-málka bt-áw6ð bìyi.} ‘See, the king will do (something) to me.’
(A21:33)
(13) ""áp-""ana šqiláli š6ndùxta} d6ryáli bìya.} ‘I picked up a small stone and
threw it at it.’ (A23:22)
(14) ""áp-xa l5le-mßáya bíya dìya.} ‘Nobody could (do anything) against her
(= nobody could defeat her).’ (A25:68)
(15) šuréla ßráxa bíye dìye.} ‘She started shouting at him.’ (A25:82)
(16) bálki t-íle xa-mèndi °í°a bìya.} ‘Perhaps something has happened to
her.’ (A21:25)
The preposition with the sense of ‘disadvantage’ is found after the existential particle in expressions such as:
(17) ""ána bsìmli} ‘ú-mdi li°-bìyi.} ‘I am cured. Nothing is the matter with
me.’ (A4:20)
With some verbs the preposition b- may be exchanged for other prepositions to express a different relationship to the complement. In (18), for
example, the verb xyara ‘to look’ takes a complement with b- (‘look at’),
but in the second clause the complement has gu- to express ‘looking into’
the enclosed interior of the cave:
(18) qamáye xírta b-áql6t súsa dìya,} la-xírra gu-gêppa.} ‘At first she looked at
the legs of her horse, she did not look into the cave.’ (A8:72)800chapter sixteen16.1.11. b6d-, budThe expression b6d- and its variant bud- is in origin a combination of the
preposition b- and the subordinating particle D. It is not, however, used
with exactly the same distribution as the basic preposition b-. It generally has the sense of ‘about, concerning’, which is not a meaning that is
generally expressed by b- alone, e.g.
(1)(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)""6n-xá-naša m7°elaxu xàbra} b6d-bròni,} kut-m5°éli xábra b6d-bròni,} ""6n-mí°a
""6n-ßàxi,} pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle dìye.} ‘If somebody brings you word
about my son—whoever brings me word about my son, whether
he is dead or alive, I’ll give him half of my gold.’ (A14:92)
""ánna šèmye-wawa b6d-M8mo m6n-Zìne.} ‘They had heard about M>mo
from Zine.’ (A26:25)
šmìla bud-díye.} ‘They heard about him.’ (A21:5)
lá taxmènn6n ""ána b6d-z6ndàna.} ‘I shall not think about prison (= I
don’t care about prison).’ (A26:44)
náše spáy t-y8ði bud-màrra} ‘fine people who know about the illness’
(A8:32)
qím6n molèxm6nna ""ánna šére bud-dìye.} ‘I composed these verses about
him.’ (C4:3)
b6d-""áwwa náša tàlx6x.} ‘Let’s destroy with regard to this man (= let’s
get rid of this man).’ (A30:41)Elsewhere the phrase is occasionally used to denote relations that are
expressed by the basic b- preposition, including causal (‘because of, on
account of ’), instrumental (‘through the means of ’) and comitative (‘with’),
e.g.
(8)bud-àyya mu°7lux ""ánna zúze.} ‘Because of this you have brought these
coins.’ (A1:27)
(9) rába ""ítley xayú°a basímta b6d-àyya,} yá'ni zrát6t xabùše.} ‘They had a
very good life on account of this, that is the cultivation of apples.’
(B5:106)
(10) y-axlíwa lèxma bêd-an q7se.} ‘They would eat bread through the means
of (the sale of ) this wood.’ (A14:10)
(11) ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ‘This head of mine
will one day be cut off by your hands.’ (A14:35)
(12) qímla k°úla xa-k°àwa,} mšudèrra b6d-qàz6d.} ‘She wrote a letter and
sent it by a messenger.’ (A11:17)the syntax of prepositions801(13) l5šále bàxta,} b6d-míya mênne.} ‘A woman kneads it, together with
water.’ (B5:100)
In addition it is found in a few fixed expressions, e.g.
(14) qím5le híw6lla bná°e dìye} †la-d-an-nàše,} b6d-xá†6r d-ó-xona zòra.} ‘He gave
his daughters to those people on account of that young brother.’
(A12:22)
(15) har-dmíxt5la b6d-lèbba gu-b7°6t bába dìy5la.} ‘She continued sleeping,
thinking that she was in her father’s house.’ (A21:18)
16.1.12. Combined with Other Prepositions
The preposition b- is often combined with the locative preposition reš‘upon’, e.g.
(1)
(2)hóle dèrya jùlla b-réša.} ‘He put a cloth over them.’ (A25:48)
qím5le zíla mútta ""án-julla díya gu-d-o-sandùqa,} mútt6lla gu-""asàs6t b7°a,}
""u-bèny5le gùda b-réše.} ‘He put her clothes in a box and placed it in
the foundations of the house, then built a wall over it.’ (A14:99)
16.2. L-This preposition has a wide variety of functions. One reason for this is
that it is derived from two different prepositions in earlier Aramaic, namely
*l-‘to, for’ and *'al ‘upon’. Generally the usage of l- in the dialect makes it
clear from which of these two earlier prepositions it is derived in any one
particular case. In some cases, however, the derivation is not completely
certain. For this reason all the usages of l- are here treated together. It is
important, furthermore, to make a distinction between the adnominal uses
of l- and the adpronominal forms. Various possibilities exist for pronominalizing a phrase consisting of l + nominal. These include the L-suffixes
and independent phrases consisting of ""6ll- + pronominal suffixes. Each
of these pronominal forms has a restricted usage and is not found in all
contexts that l + nominal phrases are used.","[824, 825, 826, 827, 828, 829, 830, 831, 832, 833, 834, 835, 836, 837, 838, 839, 840]"
"598chapter fifteenIn (12) the second mention of the act of throwing the coin is expressed
by a ""i-qa†6lwa form (""i-daríwa). The purpose is not to present this act as
more noteworthy than the acts that follow it. Rather it is used to mark a
boundary in discourse structure, namely the onset of a sequence of clauses
describing the game at the pool. Similarly in (13) the second mention of
the placing of the bride on the back of a mule, which is expressed by a
""i-qa†6lwa form, marks the onset of a sequence of clauses that describe
the event known as ‘appe buke.
The ""i-qa†6lwa form in (14) marks the beginning of a span of discourse
that elaborates and expands on the previous general statement that they
gave the fallen apples to the animals. It coincides with a shift from general
to specific perspective.
On some occasions the ""i-qa†6lwa form is used to signal the closure of
a discourse section. Again, the primary purpose is not to give particular
prominence to the semantic content of this final action in the section, but
rather to use it as a boundary marker in the discourse structure. This is
the case, for example, in (15), where the man’s going to sleep is the final
event of his working day, but is not intended to be interpreted as the
most important one:
(15) kút-yum šúle díye mòdi-wewa?} šaqêlwale táwre díye} ""u-šaqêlwa xmáre díye}
qèdamta} y-azèlwa z>rèwa} ""u-y-a°éwa l-bˆ°a,} y-axèlwa mèndi ""i-damêxwa.}
‘Everyday what was his job? He would take his ox and take his
ass early in the morning and go to cultivate (his field). He would
then come back home, eat something and go to sleep.’ (A21:4)
15.1.5. b6d-qa†6l
The prefixed particle b6d- in this form is generally phonetically reduced in
natural fast speech to bt-, t- or b- (cf. §8.6.2.), e.g. ""ána bt-àz6n} ‘I shall go’
(A8:51), t-azítu ‘You shall go’ (A8:27), b-tàr6ß ‘He will be cured’ (A8:33).
15.1.5.1. Predictive Future
One of the basic functions of the b6d-qa†6l form is to express the future
tense. In cases where the subject of the verb is 3rd person or where it is a
non-agentive 1st or 2nd person, this is generally a predictive future, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)b-nayêsli} t-axêlli.} ‘He will bite me. He will eat me.’ (A1:17)
""áp-""ana b-qa†êlli.} ‘He will kill me also.’ (A42:3)
""áy hóla dmìxta.} yóm6t ""àrbi b-q7ma.} ‘She is asleep. On the fortieth
day she will get up.’ (A24:17)the syntax of verbs
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)599táma b-xáz6t xa-†úra ramàna.} ‘There you will see a high mountain.’
(A8:47)
b-qlábtux b-xazènna Bèlb6l Hazàr mènnux.} ‘When you return I shall
see B6lb6l Hazar with you.’ (A8:52)
""áy šaqí°a bt-áza. ‘The channel will flow.’ (A8:11)
kút-yom t-á°i làxxa.} ‘They will come here every day.’The form is perfective, since it presents actions delimited with a start and
end point or at least with a start point. The form may also express iterative aspect (7). In this context the form can still be interpreted as perfective, in that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express each
individual perfective occurrence of the iterated situation.
The predicted events may be about to occur in the very near future, as
is shown by (8) and (9), where the verb is used with the adverb ‘now’:
(8)
(9)hadíya t-à°ya Zíne,} ""arbí b5rbiyá°a mênna.} ‘Now Zine is going to come
with forty bridesmaids.’ (A26:78)
díya t-á°i p5rmìl6n.} ‘Now they are going to come to slaughter us.’
(A4:54)The expression of imminence may be intensified by the phrase h6nt-ila ‘It
is a little’ (Kurd. hind), e.g.
(10) hènt-ila t-à°e} ‘He will come very soon’
The b6d-qa†6l form is used as a future tense in direct or indirect interrogative clauses, e.g.
(11) ""7ka b-kále Gozàli?} ‘Where will Gozali stay?’ (A8:51)
(12) xáz6x mò-t-aw6ð.} ‘Let’s see what he will do.’ (A4:21)
(13) xáz6n mó bt-amêrri.} ‘I’ll see what he’ll say to me.’ (A8:43)
15.1.5.2. Deontic Future
When the verb has an agentive 1st singular subject the b6d-qa†6l form
generally has a modal sense expressing deontic intention, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)b-ßàly6n} b-tápq6n bìye.} ‘I shall go down to meet him.’ (A4:21)
""àp-""ana bt-áz6n šúla} pàlx6n.} ‘I also shall go and work.’ (A23:1)
b-zonènne b-xamšì dináre.} ‘I shall buy it for fifty dinars.’ (A24:23)
t-yawènnux zùzux.} ‘I shall give you your money.’ (A1:10)600chapter fifteenThe intention may be to perform the action in the immediate future,
e.g.
(5)hadíya b-zadrànna gáni.} ‘Now I am going to shake myself.’ (A24:27)When expressing deontic intention the b6d-qa†6l form is occasionally combined with the particle of immediacy d6-/de-, e.g.
(6)
(7)""ána d6-t-amrènnox ""ó-mdi-t taxrênne.} ‘I shall tell you what I remember.’
(B15:1)
pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle dìye.} ‘I shall give him half of my gold.’
(A14:92)When the verb has an agentive 1st plural subject, the form often has a
cohortative modal sense (Let’s . . .), e.g.
(8)
(9)bt-àrqexi.} ‘Let’s flee.’ (A30:41)
bas-t-ázexi †albèxla m-bába dìya.} ‘But let us go and ask her father for
her hand.’ (A29:38)
(10) b-súr6° l7ð6n mú y-amrìle,} t-ámr6x mtag6bràna.} ‘I do not know what
they call it in sur6°, let’s say “governor.” ’ (B6:47)The form may express deontic obligation. In such cases the verb generally
has an agentive 2nd person subject, e.g.
(11) ""ati bt-àzet.} ‘You should go.’ (A8:46)
(12) t-azítu qam-d-o-gêppa,} ""aw-gèppa rába ramàn5le.} b-qarìtu:} ""ó Bèlb6l Hazàr!}
‘You should go to the cave, the cave is very high. You should cry
“Oh B6lb6l Hazar.” ’ (A8:28)
(13) b-zˆn6t} gót6t d-an-xoránux xène} ""u-b-qàr6t.} t-ámr6t ""ó Bèlb6l Hazàr!} ‘You
should stand next to the others, your friends, and call out. You
should say “Oh B6lb6l Hazar!” ’ (A8:48)
Occasionally the form expresses deontic obligation also in other persons,
e.g.
(14) t-áz6l †alèbla m-be-bába diya.} ‘He should go and ask her father’s
family for her hand.’ (A29:39)
(15) ""èlla b-šaqlênna} xá°6t Mir-Zándin barxênna-llux.} ‘But I must first take
the sister of Mir Zandin to marry her to you.’ (A26:39)the syntax of verbs601When used in questions the form can sometimes be interpreted as expressing deontic obligation (‘What should he do?’) or deontic possibility (‘What
can he do?’), whereby the speaker addresses the hearer expecting him to
impose an obligation or give permission, e.g.
(16) políse mù t-óði?} ‘What should/can the police do?’ (A8:9)
(17) mó t-oðèna?} ‘What should/can I do?’ (A1:17)
(18) mò t-ámr6n ""ána?} ‘What should/can I say?’ (A26:34)
It is occasionally used to express deontic possibility in other contexts, for
example in the expression t-amr6t ‘you could say’, which is used to introduce comparative descriptions as in (19) and (20):
(19) rqàð5la,} ""u-píšla t-ámr6t xlùl5le táma.} ‘They danced and you could
say that (= it seemed that) there was a wedding there.’ (A35:7)
(20) ""o-kêlša} rába qùwy5wa,} yá'ni m-bár xá ""6ßrá yomà°a,} yá'ni t-amrètte
dabêšwa,} kúlla t-amrètte dabèšwa xá kèpa yá'ni,} képa-w kêlša.} ‘After
about ten days, you could say concerning it (= it seems) that it
stuck together, you could say concerning it (= it seems) that the
gypsum all stuck together in a single stone.’ (B5:185)
15.1.5.3. Conditional Constructions
The b6d-qa†6l form is used in the apodosis of conditional sentences. In
the majority of cases it expresses an action that is temporally sequential
to a hypothetical situation in the future. As elsewhere the form should
be interpreted as perfective, expressing a complete action with start and
end point or an action that is at least delimited with a start point that is
sequential to the situation described in the protasis, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)""6n-háwe t-têrte ""aqlá°a,} ""ána b-zawnênne.} ‘If it were two legged, I
would buy it.’ (A22:5)
""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.} ‘If I were to have a daughter, I
would give her to your son.’ (A25:8)
""6n-kpìnni,} t-axlênne.} ‘If I am hungry, I shall eat it.’ (A23:5)
""6n-š8r6† díyi q6m-y>ðêtla,} xo-b-gawrànnux.} ‘If you know (the answer
to) my test, I shall indeed then marry you.’ (A25:62)
""6n-""amrènnux ""áp-""ati b-šàn6t.} ‘If I tell you, you will faint.’ (A11:2)
""6n-""ánna mt>m6mêtla,} ""ána t-yànna-llux.} ‘If you fulfil these (conditions),
I shall give them to you.’ (A12:2)
""6n-""axlíl6n š6kwáne t-axlìl6n.} ‘If the ants eat us, they shall eat us.’
(A14:52)602chapter fifteenIn some cases it expresses a future action that follows logically from a
given, real situation in the present denoted by the protasis clause, e.g.
(8) ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila.} ‘If he is my nephew, he
will come and he will know what these are.’ (A25:49)
(9) ""6n-réš6t bábe díye ""ax-†ùra,} ""u-hóle q†íla l-T>tár-i Slemán-i Sêndi,} lˆka btáz6l?} ‘If the head of his father is like a mountain and he has been
killed by T>tar-i Sleman-i S6ndi, where will he go?’ (A28:8)
15.1.5.4. Discourse Dependency
In conditional constructions such as those illustrated in §15.1.5.3. the
action in the apodosis is presented from the viewpoint of the situation
in the protasis and always has a future reference relative to this viewpoint. On some occasions the b6d-qa†6l form expresses dependency on a
preceding clause outside of conditional constructions. In such cases the
action in the b6d-qa†6l clause is not presented from the viewpoint of the
preceding clause and so does not necessarily have future time reference.
It may have present time reference. The form is perfective, delimited
either by a start and end point or at least by a start point that is sequential to what precedes. It may also express iterative aspect, but still should
be interpreted as perfective, in that it expresses one occurrence of an
event that is representative of the iterated situation. The b6d- prefix in
these constructions has lost the function of future temporal reference
but expresses only dependency. This dependency make take the form of
temporal sequentiality as in (1)–(5), e.g.
(1) ""èrbe máxe l-©ðàðe,} t-ázi xa-fàtra,} ""al-salíq6 zòrna.} máxe zórna xa-salíqa
xèna,} ""èrbe b-dˆri,} b-ganèy.} ‘He gathers the sheep together and they go
off for a while according to the tune of the pipe. He plays another
tune on the pipe and the sheep return, by themselves.’ (A25:27)
(2) ""u-zíl5le t-áz6l ""á°‰6t bàb6 d-5-bráta.} ‘He set off and went to the land
of the girl’s father.’ (A29:34)
(3) b-l7le qímla šárya b>núda dìya,} t-àza,} p°íxla t8ra qðìla.} ‘At night she
got up, untied her bands, then went and opened the door with a
key.’ (A18:3)
(4) ""u-šuréle 'ajòze} yá'ni k‘àxa.} ""u-t-lá xàl6†} t-ám6r ya-""álaha šqùlli.} ‘He had
started to get incapable and tired and, in order for him not to commit an error, he says “Oh God, take me!” ’ (A15:19)
(5) bá°6r ""éða gò‰a} y-á°e ""arbì-yome} bá°6r ""éða d-o-gò‰a} ""ì°ena} ""éð6t sulàqa.}
. . . xàr°a} t-á°e xá-""eða xréna zòra,} y-amríle ""éð6t musàrde.} ‘After the Greatthe syntax of verbs603Festival, forty days after the Great Festival, the festival of Ascension
takes place. . . . Afterwards comes a small festival, which is called
musarde.’ (B6:5–8)
In some cases the b6d-qa†6l form does not express temporal sequentiality but
only some kind of relevance to a preceding clause. Consider (6) and (7):
(6) báw°6 Ninwàye} ""áp-""ay ""ìtwa.} ß5mìla.} t-ámri díge-w k°àye} ""áp ""an-zóre
xtàye.} ‘The Rogation of the Ninevites was also observed (in our
community). They would fast during it. They would say “The cocks
and the chickens, and also the small lowly creatues (should observe
the fast).” ’ (B16:15)
(7) ""ána háw6n Qára Tè≥din,} ma°yán6t xárje-w bárj6t bo†anàye.} t-á°e xa-""árxa
""ax-d-àwwa} gu-bˆ°i} ""u-pál6† l7ð6n lˆk5le zála,} l7ka là!} ‘I am Qara
Te≥din, the collector of all taxes of the people of Botan, and a
guest comes like this into my house and leaves without me knowing
where on earth he was going!’ (A26:34)
In (6) the clause introduced by the verb t-ámri consitutes an elaboration
of the preceding statement that people would hold a fast, which could
be paraphrased ‘with regard to this fasting they say. . . .’ In (7) the b6d-qa†6l
form verb t-á°e denotes an action that is to be interpreted in the context
of the speaker having a high social position, which is expressed by the
statement ‘I am Qara Te≥din, the collector of all taxes of the people of
Botan’. In (6) and (7) the b6d-qa†6l verbs do not express sequentiality but
nevertheless they are in some way dependent on what precedes. In (6)
it may be said that the clause with the b6d-qa†6l form introduces background to the preceding foreground, whereas in (7) the form introduces
a foregrounded statement that is to be interpreted against the preceding
background.
The fact that the use of the b6d-qa†6l form may be motivated by the
broad property of relevance to what precedes implies that it could be
used anywhere within a section of discourse, since, in principle, all clauses
would be in some way relevant to what precedes. This is how we should
understand its use with the verb ""mr ‘to say’ within sections of expository
discourse such as (8) and (9), where they have habitual aspect:
(8) m-l5le mbàdla táma,} yá'ni mbarxìwa.} y-a°éwa qàša.} har-gu-bˆ°a} y-as‰íwale
gnùna-w} yá'ni t-ámr6x mbarxìwale.} ‘In the early morning they would
perform the blessing (of the wedding ceremony) there. A priest604(9)chapter fifteen
would come. In the house they would tie the band. We say “They
blessed it.” ’ (B5:30)
béna bálki ""o-nàša,} ""o-xêtna t-ámr6x,} ""o-""ùrza,} lè-y-awe táma.} ‘Perhaps
the person, we say the groom, the man, was not there.’ (B5:18)These b6d-qa†6l forms of ""mr are used interchangeably with the ""i-qa†6l
form, e.g.
(10) y-atwíwa b-dawˆre,} ""7-ga b-dawˆre,} . . . koðênta y-amrèxxa.} ‘They would
sit on mules, at that time (they sat) on mules, .. a koð6nta (‘female
mule’) we call it.’ (B5:28)
In (11) the b6d-qa†6l form is used in clauses that depend on what precedes
in that they have the status of non-restrictive relative clauses qualifying a
head noun in the first clauses. This is similar to the elaborative function
in (6) above:
(11) kút-naša gu-""Ón-Núne ""ítle xaqlà°a,} b-z>rèla} zrùta,} ""6n-t-awèdla bustàne,}
""6n-t-awèdle kù-mdi-t b8ye.} ‘Everybody in ""“n-Nune has fields, which
he cultivates, or he makes into an orchard or whatever he wants.’
(B4:2)
15.1.5.5. Negation of b6d-qa†6l Forms
The negative particle cannot be combined with the b6d-qa†6l form. To
express the negative, the negated form of the qa†6l or ""i-qa†6l form is used,
viz. la-qa†6l or la-y-qa†6l respectively. As described in §8.9., there are various
phonetic variants of the la-y-qa†6l form, which exhibit various degrees of
contaction, viz. le-y-qa†6l, l5-qa†6l, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)""ána là-""a°6n mènnux.} †la-mò la-""á°6t mènni?} sí là-""a°6n mènnux ""ána.} ‘ “I
shall not come with you.” “Why won’t you come with me?” “Go
away, I shall not come with you.” ’ (A6:6)
qázi t-awèdla †làlux,} lá-""aw6dla †làli.} ‘The judge will make a decision
in your favour, he will not make it in my favour.’ (A6:8)
lá masp6rèxl6x bi-zàwda.} ‘We shall not make you wait more.’
(A4:41)
lè-y-axlena.} ‘I shall not eat.’ (B5:35)
""ána m-axxa-húdxa lè-y-az6n.} ‘I shall not go beyond here.’ (A12:23)
""ána là-y-asq6n.} ‘I shall not go up.’ (A32:29)the syntax of verbs605(7) bas-lè-y-y6nna bná°i-ll5xu.} ‘But I shall not give my daughters to you.’
(A12:17)
The ""i-qa†6l form is used elsewhere to express imperfective habitual aspect.
As remarked above, however, the positive b6d-qa†6l form is intrinsically perfective. The explanation appears to be that the positive future perfective
form asserts that a specific action will take place at a particular point in
time whereas its negated form should properly be interpreted as expressing an enduring property of the subject referent rather than referring to
an event that is bound to a particular point in time. When a speaker says
t-axl6n ‘I shall eat’, he is asserting that there will be a particular point in
time when he will eat. When he says le-y-axl6n, on the other hand, the
sense is ‘I have the property of not eating’. The salience of the particular point in time of an action is diffused when it is negated to the extent
that an imperfective form is used. The use of the negated qa†6l form,
viz. la-qa†6l, should, likewise, be interpreted as expressing a non-punctual
habitual imperfective aspect.
A parallel to this diffusion of the salient temporal punctuality of a perfective form by negation is found in the imperative. Imperative forms express
a more salient, immediate command than deontic qa†6l forms. Although
imperatives can be negated, there is a greater tendency for negated commands to be expressed by qa†6l forms than is the case with positive commands (for further details see §15.7.). In some NENA dialects, furthermore,
a negated command can only be expressed by a qa†6l form.
15.1.6. b6d-qa†6lwa
15.1.6.1. Conditional Constructions
The b6d-qa†6lwa form, with the past converter suffix -wa, is used in the
apodosis of conditional sentences that refer to a hypothetical condition in
the past, which was not fulfilled (1–2), or to a hypothetical condition in
the present or future, which the speaker assesses to be impossible to fulfil
(3–4). The verb form expresses an action that is temporally or logically
sequential to the situation expressed in the protasis. Since it is delimited
by a starting point that is sequential to what precedes, it is inherently
perfective, e.g.
(1) ""6n-mbaqrêtwa,} t-yawènwalux zùze,} bás là mbuqèrrux.} ‘If you had asked,
I would have given you money, but you did not ask.’606chapter fifteen(2) ""6n-y>ðènwa manay-díye mòdiwa,} t-amrênwalux,} bas-là y>ð6…wa.} ‘If I had
known what its meaning was, I would have told you, but I did not
know.’
(3) ""6n-maßênwa,} t-a°ênwa,} bás lè-y-maß6n.} ‘If I could, I would come, but
I cannot.’
(4) ""6n-hawètwa gu-""á°‰a dìyi,} kú-m6ndi b>yètwa t-yànwalux.} ‘If you were in
my country, I would give you whatever you wanted.’ (A26:57)
The form may also express iterative aspect. In this context the form can
still be interpreted as perfective in that the speaker uses the form that is
appropriate to express each individual perfective occurrence of the iterated situation, e.g.
(5) ""6n-maßènwa t-yawènwalux zúze kùt-yum,} t-yawênwalux,} bás le-y-maßênwa.}
‘If I had been able to give you money every day, I would have given
it to you, but I could not.’
(6) ""6n-maßènwa t-yawènwalux zúze kùt-yum,} t-yawênwalux,} bas le-y-màß6n.}
‘If I could give you money every day, I would give it to you, but I
cannot.’
15.1.6.2. Deontic Constructions
The b6d-qa†6lwa form is used in questions relating to counterfactual situations in the past. They are of a deontic nature, in that the speaker addresses
the hearer expecting him to impose an obligation (deontic necessity: ‘What
should I have done?’) or give permission (deontic possibility: ‘What could
I have done?’), e.g.
(1) ""ína m-ˆka} t-óð6nwale gèšra?} ‘But from where could I have made him
a bridge?’ (A17:18)
(2) gúrz6 šèrmux xo-""ána t-azènwa bìya?} ‘(Why) should I have been finished off by your stupid club (literally: the club of your behind)?!’
(A52:17)
15.1.6.3. Discourse Dependency
The b6d-qa†6lwa form is used outside of conditional constructions in clauses
that are in some way dependent on the preceding discourse. In such cases
the verb always expresses an iterative action. Various types of discourse
dependency are attested in the text corpus. In (1) and (2) the b6d-qa†6lwa
verbs are temporally sequential to what precedes:the syntax of verbs607(1) ‘5rxìwala má°a} xáß6 dawˆre.} y-amríwa ‘áppe bùkela.} ""ay-t-a°yàwa,}
t-oràwa,} maxyáwa . . . mêšxa} ""u-t-oðáwa ßlìwa,} mêšxa,} gu-t8r6t qàßra.} ‘They
would take her (the bride) round the village on the back of mules.
They called it ‘appe buke. (Then) she would come back, enter (the
house) and make with oil . . . and make (the sign of ) the cross in oil
on the door of the house.’ (B10:34–35)
(2) la-°éle rèš-ßàwma?} b-šaqlèxwa kúlla ""amàn6n,} kùlla b-šaqlèxwala} d7r6xwa
qè†ma mxallêxwala.} ‘When the beginning of the (Lent) fast came, we
would take all our vessels, we would take them all and put ash on
them to clean them.’ (B16:7)
Other types of dependency are exhibited by the verb forms in the following examples:
(3) qam-ßàwma} ""í° xošéb6 bnà°a.} bná°a kúlla bt-azíwa bˆ°a,} b-šaqlíwa ""ixála
m6n-d-áwwa d-áwwa d-àwwa,} t-azíwa gu-xa-†ùra,} t-atwìwa,} t-axlìwa,}
b-šatìwa.} ‘Before the fast (of Lent) was Girls’ Sunday. All the girls
went home, took food from here and from there, then went to a
mountain, where they sat, ate and drank.’ (B16:18)
(4) ""a-""ilána mzabnìwala y-amrèxxa.} t-a°7wa xèzme dìye} t-amêrwa} hé gáll6k
nàše,} ""7ni záw6n ""ilàna?} xa-náša díye t-ám6rwa ""ána zonènna b-""êßra,} šaqlíwa
""èßra dinàre.} ""u-xéna t-ám6rwa zonènna b-xamšàss6r,} šaqlíwa xamšàss6r.}
‘They sold the tree, as we say. His relatives would come and (one)
said “Hey, everybody, who will buy the tree?” One relative of his
would say “I shall buy it for ten” and they would receive ten dinars.
Another would say “I shall buy it for fifteen” and they would receive
fifteen.’ (B5:42)
(5) ""í°wal6n ""ùmra} Mar-Gwìrgis} . . . ""u-réše dìye} ""iwàwa} wíðta †la-plàša.}
t-awríwa nàše} gáwa gáw6t ""ùmra,} rèše,} xazíwala kùlla dukáne,} palšìwa.}
‘We had the church of Saint George . . . The top of it was designed
for war. People would enter into the church, (go up) on top of it,
and they would see all places, when there was fighting.’ (B2:3)
(6) lá-mß6xwa t-óð6xwa ‘ú-mdi qam-tàlga.} ma-t-y-a°éwa tàlga,} y-a°èwa,}
lá-mßiwa ""àp-axxa pal†íwa.} t-attèxwa béna gu-bˆ°a.} ‘We could not do
anything on account of the winter. So much snow fell that people
could not go out even to here. We sat in the house.’ (B16:27)
In (3) the clause containing the first b6d-qa†6lwa verb, bt-azíwa, opens a section of discourse that elaborates on the preceding general statement that608chapter fifteenthe festival of Girls’ Sunday took place. The dependency expressed by
the verbal form binds it semantically to what precedes signalling that the
description of the specific event in the clause is intended to be understood
as a component of the festival. This example also contains a subsequent
chain of b6d-qa†6lwa forms (b-šaqlíwa . . . t-azíwa . . . t-atwìwa . . . t-axlìwa,
b-šatìwa). The clauses containing these verbs are also elaborative of the
initial general statement. Most of them can also be interpreted as temporally sequential to the clause immediately preceding it. The semantic
dependency in these clauses consists of both the relation of specific to
general and also temporal sequence.
Example (4) is similar to (3). The first b6d-qa†6lwa verb, t-a°7wa, occurs
in a clause at the onset of a section of discourse that describes the specific events of the general event of selling the tree. The discourse dependency, therefore, is the relationship of specific to general. The subsequent
b6d-qa†6lwa verbs (t-ám6rwa . . . t-ám6rwa) are, likewise, specifying this general
event, but also are temporally sequential to what immediately precedes
them.
The clause containing the b6d-qa†6lwa verb in (5) occurs at the onset
of a section that elaborates on the preceding statement concerning the
roof of the church.
The relationship of the verb t-attèxwa in (6) to what precedes is one of
effect to cause, i.e. people could not go out on account of the snow and
for this reason we sat in the house.
15.1.6.4. Negation of b6d-qa†6lwa Forms
There is a similar constraint against combining the negative particle with
the b6d-qa†6lwa as there is with the b6d-qa†6l form. To express negation, the
negated qa†6lwa and ""i-qa†6lwa forms are used suppletively, e.g.
(1) xà-m6nn5xu b-taréwa} ""u-xéna là taréwa.} ‘One of you would get wet
and the other would not get wet.’ (A17:18)
(2) ""6n-háw5 ""6ßrà †iyáre xéne} ""axwá°ux hawnàne,} la-ma†étuwa l-àwwa lèxma,}
""u-""attítuwa láxxa p5šítuwa hátxa snìqe.} ‘If ten other men from ˇiyare
were as intelligent as you, you would not have reached this miserable condition, you would not be sitting here and have become so
poor.’ (A17:16)
(3) ""áp-""6n mbaqrêtwa,} le-y-yawènwalux zùze.} ‘Even if you had asked, I
would not have given you money.’the syntax of verbs60915.1.7. q6m-qa†6l
15.1.7.1. Preliminary Remarks
This form is used before pronominal L-suffixes, i.e. q6m-qa†6lle, q6m-qa†6lla,
q6m-qa†6ll5, etc. The L-suffixes may express the direct object or the indirect object. It expresses a past perfective aspect. As has been remarked
(§15.1.1.1.), the qa†6l form without additional affixes may express a present
perfective. The q6m-qa†6l form has been formed by attaching the prefix
q6m- to this perfective qa†6l base. The q6m- prefix is likely to be a fossilized
form of the old suffix conjugation form *qadd6m ‘He did (something) beforehand’.2 In some isolated cases before initial /""/ verbs, the subordinating
D particle is inserted between the q6m and the verb, e.g. q6m-t-amèrra ‘He
said to her’ (A4:4).
There is no functional difference between the q6m-qa†6l form and the
q†ille form, which also expresses past perfective aspect. The q6m-qa†6l form
is used as a more versatile means of expressing the past perfective with
L-suffixes. Direct or indirect pronominal objects of the 3rd person may
be expressed by incorporation into the past base q†ille form, e.g. q†ille ‘He
killed him’, q†ilale ‘He killed her’, q†ilile ‘He killed them’. The q6m-qa†6l
form is the usual means of expressing pronominal objects of the 1st and
2nd person on a past perfective verb and it expresses 3rd person objects
interchangeably with the q†ille form with object incorporation.
15.1.7.2. Recent Past Events
In conversational discourse the normal function of the q6m-qa†6l form is to
express with perfective aspect the occurrence of a punctual event in the
recent past. The margin of the recent past may extend up to the present
moment. The form may be used, therefore, when the endpoint of the event
is witnessed in the present moment. It is appropriate to translate the form
in such contexts by the English perfect of recent past. Examples of this
are found in the text corpus, mainly in sections of direct speech, e.g.
(1) ""áti q6m-xalßàtli} m6n-d-áwwa mò°a.} ‘You have saved me from death.’
(A14:35)2
In many NENA dialects the prefix has an /a/ vowel (qam-). In Barwar the attenuation
of the /a/ to /6/ is regular and the form contrasts with the particle qam ‘before’, which
generally preserves the /a/ (§2.3.5.). In the C. Sulemaniyya and C. Sanandaj dialects the
auxiliary verb *qadd6m has developed into the form tam- with the elision of the first syllable
and devoicing of the medial *d.","[636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648]"
"462chapter fourteen(8)""ína brón6t málka °èle} ""u-ðà mènne díye.} ‘Behold the son of the king
has come and a girl is with him.’ (A14:93)
(9) dawqíwa bná°a b-""íð6t ġðáðe hàtxa,} yá'ni ràbe doqíwa,} ða-dwíqta ""íð6

(10) ""áyya Zíne ""í°6n trè""e.} ða-xà°ela} ""u-ða-bàxtela.} ‘There are two of
such (women called) Zine. One is his sister and one is his wife.’
(A26:61)
(11) šqíl6lla m6n-d-5-dˆrta,} núbl6lla zêdy6lla gu-ða-xèta.} ‘They took it

beads of a rosary. She put them on the stone slab of the spring,
one red, one white and one blue.’ (A25:34)
A few exceptions are attested, such as (13) and (14), in which the feminine
form of the adjective xeta is combined with xa rather than ða:
(13) ðà-b-ða šáqla-w} mattá xa-xèta.} ‘She takes them (gutta°a f. balls of
dough) one by one and puts another in.’ (B5:102)
(14) ""ap-xa-xéta ""axlàla.} ‘She eats another one (another leg ""aqla f.).’
(A18:21)
14.2. Gender
We shall restrict ourselves here to noting the use of the feminine singular
form of pronouns and verbal inflection in situations where they do not
refer to a distinct referent. These can be categorized as follows:
14.2.1. Discourse Anaphora
Feminine singular forms are used to refer anaphorically to the general,
propositional content of the surrounding discourse, e.g.
(1)
(2)""6n-""áw6ð hàtxa,} lˆla spáy.} ‘If he does this, it is not good.’ (A14:6)
""áyy6t miràli ""êllux} kùlla wiðále.} ‘What I have told you—all of this
he has done.’ (A24:20)the syntax of nominals463(3)mxéli s7pa ""êlle,} ‘ú-m6ndi la-wìdla.} ‘I struck a sword into him, but
that (action) did nothing.’ (A12:36)
(4) xamlèxwa bìya.} ‘We enjoyed the occasion.’ (B5:33)
(5) m-k6s-gàne q6m-mdabèrra} mxalóße xàye díye.} ‘He fabricated it (what he
had just said) to save his life.’ (A39:6)
(6) plì††5la} gu-mà°a,} kút-xa q†ála ġðàðe.} ‘It (what had happened) got
about in the village and everyone fought with one another.’
(A7:14)
(7) hátxa la-hàwya.} ‘This cannot be.’ (A21:32)
(8) šwiqáli táma-w °éli làxxa.} ‘I have left it (the situation of the narrative)
there and come here’ (formula marking the end of a narrative).
(A26:91)
(9) b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Did you send for me because of this?’ (A21:35)
(10) módi mqúma ""êllux?} ""o-qamáya miràle,} ""o-t-tré miràle.} ‘ “What has
befallen you?” The first one told it (= the event) to him, the second
one told it to him.’ (A17:31)
The normally masculine noun m6ndi is construed as feminine singular in
(11), where it is singular, and (12), where it is plural, since in such cases it
refers anaphorically to the general, propositional content of what precedes
in the discourse, rather than to a specific referent:
(11) ""áyya mèndi lˆ-""a°ya l-manšóye.} ‘This thing is unforgettable.’ (B15:8)
(12) rába gáye wít5la ""ánna m6ndiyàne.} ‘Many times such things happened.’
(B5:163)
In (13)–(15) the propositional content of what follows is referred to anaphorically by feminine singular inflection. In (13) the content in question
is that of a subordinate clause that is construed as the subject of the
preceding copula (l7la š6klánta). In (14) the feminine singular form píšt5la
refers to the proposition ‘the bees are going back and forth’. In (15) the
feminine singular copula in the disclaimer zàwd5la mènni ‘it is too much
for me’ refers to the content of the following speech of the speaker:
(13) ""6n-bábux ""u-yèmmux gu-bˆ°5la,} l7la š6klánta t-ásq6t l-gàre.} ‘If your
father and mother are in the house, it is not pleasant for you to
go up onto the roof.’ (D2:7)
(14) ""u-píšt5la ""an-d6bbòre} har-zála-w °àya.} ‘The hornets continued going
back and forth.’ (A20:8)464chapter fourteen(15) mìr-e-m6n} zàwd5la mènni,} ""ána t-amr6nnˆxu} mšáx6lpu dukàne.} ‘My lord,
may I humbly suggest you change places (Literally: It is too much
for me, let me say to you, change places).’ (A26:65)
Expressions referring to mathematical operations are also treated as
feminine singular, e.g.
(16) tré-gaye tré wíta ""àrba.} ‘Two times two equals four.’
(17) xámša gáye xámša wáy5la ""èsri-w xàmša.} ‘Five times five is twentyfive.’
Infinitives, which refer to a general activity unbound to a particular point
in time, are usually construed as feminine in gender when they function
as arguments in a clause, e.g.
(18) qráya zàm6t-ila.} ‘Reading is difficult.’
(19) mdaróye modìla?} ‘What is winnowing?’ (B5:97)
Occasionally the inanimate interrogative pronoun ‘what?’ is treated as
feminine when it relates to a situation with propositional content rather
than a distinct referent, e.g.
(20) mo-t-á°ya b-rešˆni?} ‘What will come upon us?’
14.2.2. General Speech Situation
In direct speech the feminine singular is used in various expressions to
refer to the general speech situation, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)""áxxa biš-salàm6t-ila.} ‘Here it is safer.’ (A30:51)
há xèr,} mòdila?} ‘Is everything all right? What is it? (= What is the
matter?)’ (A17:29)
ßrìx5le} hàw6rila!} hàw6rila! b7°i qìdle!} ‘He cried “Woe! Woe! (literally:
It is woe) My house has burnt down.” ’ (A48:2)
xwí†la ""êlli.} ‘I am confused (literally: It is mixed up for me).’14.2.3. Temporal Expressions
The feminine singular is used in some temporal adverbial expressions to
refer to the general temporal situation in a narrative, e.g.","[500, 501, 502, 503]"

"342chapter ten10.5.2. Function of the Feminine Marker Suffixes -ta and -°a
When a corresponding masculine form of a word exists, the addition of
the feminine endings -ta or -°a serves various functions.
10.5.2.1. Marking Female Gender
In the case of animate referents, it may designate the female counterpart
of the masculine form, e.g.
araqa ‘fugitive (m.)’
6ðma ‘brother of husband’
bar6xmaya ‘brother of wife’
čuka ‘chick (m.)’
gameša ‘buffalo (m.)’
ka°awa ‘writer (m.)’
mara ‘master’
nawaga ‘grandson’
tawra ‘ox’
xa aya ‘sinner (m.)’
zaqara ‘weaver (m.)’araqta ‘fugitive (f.)’
iðam°a ‘sister of husband’
bar6xm5°a ‘sister of wife’
čukta ‘chick (f.)’
gam6šta ‘buffalo (f.)’
ka°awta ‘writer (f.)’
mar°a ‘mistress’
nawagta ‘granddaughter’
taw6rta ‘cow’
xa 5°a ‘sinner (f.)’
zaqarta ‘weaver (f.)’This distinction based on biological gender has been extended by analogy
to the inanimate objects xašola ‘pestle’ and xašolta ‘mortar’.
10.5.2.2. Expressing Singularity and Specificity
In some cases, the feminine ending expresses singularity and specificity.
The addition of the feminine ending to the infinitive form of a verb, for
example, forms the verbal noun, which expresses a single event or specific performance of the activity referred to by the verb, or some entity
or quality that results from the performance of the action. The infinitive
without the feminine ending, on the other hand, expresses the abstraction of the activity. It should be noted that even when the infinitive does
not have the feminine morphological ending, it is still often construed as
feminine in gender, e.g.
dyapa ‘to fold’
f ara ‘to breakfast’
gnaya ‘to set (sun)’
jma a ‘to gather’
mara ‘to say’dyapta ‘a fold’
f arta ‘breakfast’
gn5°a (t-yoma) ‘sunset’
jmeta ‘a gathering (of people)’
marta ‘a saying’nouns
m aya ‘to be able’
praqa ‘to finish’
saqa ‘to ascend’
syama ‘to ordain’
šya a ‘to plaster’
tawa ‘to sit’
xala ‘to eat’
xlawa ‘to milk’
xšawa ‘to think’
zraqa ‘to rise (sun)’
zraya ‘to cultivate’343m 5°a ‘ability’
praqta ‘the end’
saqta ‘ascent’
syamta ‘ordination’
šy5°a ‘plastering’
tawta ‘a sitting, social gathering’
xalta ‘food’
xlawta ‘milking’
xšawta ‘a thought’
zraqta (t-yoma) ‘sunrise’
zrata ‘cultivating’When the feminine ending is added to infinitives from stem II, stem III
and quadriliteral verbs, the /o/ in the vocalic pattern is replaced by /a/,
e.g.
mkapoše ‘to gather’
majwoje ‘to move’
mčakčoke ‘to clatter’mkapašta ‘gathering’
majwajta ‘a movement’
mčakčakta ‘clattering’The shape of stem II and quadriliteral feminine infinitives is often changed
by the elision of the initial /m/, e.g.
paxalta ‘forgiveness’
Ña m5°a ‘wisdom’
hayarta ‘help’< mpaxalta
< mÑa m5°a
< mhayartaAnother function of the feminine ending that falls in this category is its
use to express a single item of an entity that is usually referred to as a
collectivity in the plural, e.g.
b6 me ‘terebinth nuts’
čaroxe ‘leather shoes’
č6kkalle ‘slippers’
č6lloxe ‘scraps of bread’

j6nne ‘dirges’ar6p°a ‘a leaf ’
tu°ta ‘a mulberry’
d6nd6k°a ‘a seed’
jn6nta ‘a dirge’ar6pya°a/ arpa°a ‘leaves’
tu°ya°a ‘mulberries’
d6nd6kya°a ‘seeds’
jn6nya°a ‘dirges’If a masculine singular exists of words of this type, this generally has
a slightly different meaning. In the case of fruits, for example, the mas-nouns345culine singular form sometimes denotes the tree that bears the fruit in
question:
b6 ma ‘terebinth tree’
tu°a ‘mulberry tree’b 6m°a ‘terebinth nut’
tu°ta ‘mulberry’Tree names, however, are sometimes feminine, e.g. harmonta ‘pomegranate
tree/fruit’, xabušta ‘apple tree’ (xabuša ‘apple’).
Sometimes the meaning of the masculine singular and feminine singular
form of the noun is the same, e.g.
banjane ‘tomatoes’
k6xwe ‘stars’
š6kwane ‘ants’
6ppe ‘drops’banjanta ‘a tomato’
kxu°a ‘a star’
š6kwanta ‘an ant’
6p°a ‘a drop’banjana ‘a tomato’
k6xwa ‘a star’
š6kwana ‘an ant’
6ppa ‘a drop’In the case of arpe ‘leaves’, the masculine singular expresses a collectivity,
like the plural:
arpa ‘leaves’arpe ‘leaves’ar6p°a ‘a leaf ’10.5.2.3. Expressing a Diminutive
The addition of the feminine ending sometimes denotes the diminutive
of the corresponding masculine form, e.g.

referent of the feminine form is a figurative or virtual form of the entity
denoted by the masculine noun. The feminine form is not necessarily
physically smaller than that of the corresponding masculine form, but is
nevertheless a derivative, secondary form. This applies to the following
pairs of forms:
năra ‘axe’
mas6rqa ‘comb’
ruša ‘shoulder’
5na ‘eye’năre°a ‘piece in shape of an axe at the end of the
rotating shaft that fits into the upper millstone’

There is a small set of items in which the feminine form expresses a whole
of which the corresponding masculine form is a part, e.g.

sula ‘dung’Perhaps in this category belongs the pair:
dabašta ‘beehive’dabaša ‘bee’10.6. Nouns with -O Inflection
A number of nouns of feminine gender have the ending -o. This is sometimes pronounced higher in the region of /u/. For the sake of orthographic
consistency, however, it is here regularly transcribed -o. Nouns with this
ending generally refer to inanimate entities or small animals. They are
attested in the following patterns:

catch’), šalqo ‘measles’ (‘boiler’ < šlq ‘to boil’), xapro ‘trowel’ (‘digger’ < xpr ‘to
dig’). It should be noted that the base pattern is not CaCaC- (< *CaCCāC-),
which is the productive pattern for forming nouns denoting human performers of habitual activities, e.g. zaqara ‘weaver’, ka°awa ‘writer’.

‘to swallow’. The pharygnal has been dropped but the first vowel remains
short, as if it were still in a closed syllable.
(5) CoCCo
This occurs only in the word solho f. ‘peace, reconciliation’, which is a
loan from Arabic.
The historical origin of the ending -o is likely to be the diminutive ending
*-ōn in the absolute state. The final *n has been elided, as is regularly the
case in absolute state endings that survive elsewhere in the dialect, e.g.
in the 3pl. present base of the verb (qa li < *qā līn) and in numerals ( 6sri
‘twenty’ < 6srīn).
The diminutive sense of the ending is still evident in most of the nouns
listed above. Historically, however, the ending *-ōn (absolute state of *-ōnā)
is a masculine rather than a feminine form. It has apparently acquirednouns349feminine gender by a semantic association between feminine gender
and diminutives, which is reflected elsewhere in the dialect (§10.5.2.3.).
It should be noted, however, that in some NENA dialects this ending is
developing into a general feminine inflection. This is the case, for example,
in C. Alqosh, where the feminine active participle regularly ends in -u
(< *ō), e.g. x5 u ‘dressmaker’ (f.), yapyu ‘baker-woman’, gaðlu ‘knitter-woman’
(Coghill 2003: §7.8.5.). These are feminine equivalents of the masculine
active participle CaCaCa but are derived historically from the participle
base *CāCC-, as is the case with nouns such as patlo, naqro, xapro etc. in
C. Barwar.
The diminutive sense of -o may relate to novelty, as in kyalo ‘bride’, who
is a ‘new daughter-in-law’ (kal°a).
It can also be used to express endearment rather than physical smallness. It is used productively in this way to create hypocoristic forms of
personal names. These are shortened forms that generally have the bisyllabic pattern CVCo or CVCCo. Hypocoristic names of this type are those
of both men and women (for a full list see §21.22.), e.g.
(i) Men’s names
B6nno
Čăbo, Šăbo
Kanno
Mixo< B6nyam6n

< Yuxanna
< Mixayil(ii) Women’s names
Bebo
Mayyo
X6zzo
%ššo< Xošebo
< Maryam
< X6nzada
< El6šwaThe kinship term tota is frequently used with the hypocoristic ending:
toto ‘granny’. Note also the form š6tro ‘beautiful woman’, a hypocoristic
form of š6tranta.
The ending -o is also used in names given to individual domesticated
animals (for a full list see §21.23.). In this usage, however, it is restricted
to male animals, e.g.
(i) Oxen

10.7. Nouns with -E Inflection
This ending is found in a number of nouns of Aramaic stock. These are
of both genders. In some cases it appears to be derived historically from
the absolute state of a noun with a final *y radical, e.g.
arxe, 6rxe f.
ore f.
xuwwe m.
l5le m.‘water-mill’ (Syr. ra yā)
‘manger’ (Syr. uryā)
‘snake’ (Syr. ewyā)
‘night’ (Syr. līlyā, pl. laylē)In other cases the historical origin is likely to be a plural form, e.g.
gare m.
kawe f.‘roof ’ (Syr. eggārā, pl. eggārē)
‘small window’ (Syr. kaw ā, pl. kawwē)The use of an original plural form to denote a singular is found elsewhere,
e.g. na°a ‘ear’ (< * eðnā°ā). The explanation may be that the referent in
question most commonly occurs as a collectivity. The roofs of houses
in the villages were generally contiguous and interconnecting. A building generally had several of the small windows in question. All of these
originally plural nouns have acquired a new plural form (garăwa°a ‘roofs’,
kăwa°a ‘windows’, na°ya°a ‘ears’).
The final -e in the form yamne ‘right (hand/side)’ probably developed by
analogy with the Kurdish loanword čappe ‘left’. The form yamne is presumably derived ultimately from a form such as *yammīnā as in Syriac. The
analogy with čappe, therefore, affected not only the inflectional ending but
also the morphological pattern.
The final -e in stem II and stem III infinitives (mqa ole, maq ole) is derived
historically from final *-ē.
The ending -e also occurs on numerous Kurdish loanwords that are
feminine in gender, e.g.
beriye f.
čale f.
čappe f.‘milkmaid’
‘pit’
‘left (hand/side)’< Kurd. bêrî f.

It is sometimes used with proper names when these have been mentioned

(15) ""aw-mtunéle ""aw-xèlma qa-d-ó Xáno Lapzèrin.} ‘He told the dream to

It may also be used to mark a nominal with a referent that has not been
explicitly mentioned earlier but is accessible from the preceding discourse
by virtue of its typical association with some element in the content of
this discourse (associative anaphora). Such uses of the demonstrative can
normally only be translated by the English definite article, e.g.
(16) ""ína m-bá°6r maqðàli} ""aw-qê†ma} šaqlìtule} mxamìtule.} ‘After she burns

On numerous occasions the speaker deixis pronoun is used with the same
anaphoric function, viz. when the nominal has been explicitly mentioned
in the previous discourse (21–24), with previously mentioned proper
names (25), or when the referent of the nominal is accessible by associative anaphora (26):

Since the referents in the examples cited above are all internal to the
discourse, the speaker does not use the speaker deixis demonstratives to
point to an item that is physically close to him. Rather they express a
virtual or psychological closeness to the speaker, the purpose of which is
often to give prominence to the referent in the staging and perspective
with which it is presented. The default demonstrative, on the other hand,the syntax of nominals473is neutral with regard to perspective and personal engagement. The choice
of the perspective with which the speaker wishes to present the referent
in a particular point in the discourse is a subjective one. Speaker deixis
demonstratives are often used to give prominence to the referents that play
a prominent role in the text, as is the case in examples (21)–(26).
In a similar way, anaphoric reference is expressed by independent
demonstrative pronouns, with the speaker in most cases chosing either the
default demonstrative or the speaker deixis form according to the perspective with which he wishes to present the referent. Default independent pronouns indicate that the referent is identifiable somewhere in the discourse
and are unspecified as to perspective or speaker engagement, e.g.
(27) ""aw- 6¬yále tópe díye spày.} ‘He loaded his gun well.’ (A31:7)
(28) ""ay-°éla dmíxla gu-""ót6x dìya.} ‘She came back and went to sleep in
her room.’ (A17:26)
(29) xár°a ""áni mè†yela tàma} l-márz6t yàma.} ‘Then they arrived there, by
the shore of the sea.’ (A14:37)
Speaker deixis independent pronouns are used to give prominence to a
referent in close perspective. They are often used to refer to protagonists
in a narrative and other textually prominent referents, e.g.
(30) ""áwwa plí†5le gu-ða-dúnye xèta,} š6mša milànta,} ""8ra milànta.} ‘He opened
it and he came out into another world, with a blue sun and a blue
land.’ (A14:26)
(31) ""áyya rìqt5la} ßlì°5la} hàw6rila!} ‘She ran and went down (crying)
“Beware!”’ (A24:42)
(32) ""ánna pìðela mènne díye,} ""ap-šlàma l7la dèry6lle.} ‘They passed by him,
but did not even greet him.’ (A15:13)
There may be a shift in the type of demonstrative that is used to refer to
one particular referent in different sections of the discourse, which reflects
changes in perspective. This is illustrated in (33), an extract from a narrative
that involves two protagonists, the Leli°a monster and the daughter-in-law
of the family. The narrative begins with the arrival of the Leli°a. In this
section she is the most salient and most active character and is presented
with close perspective by the speaker deixis demonstrative ""ayya [1]. In the
course of the narrative, however, the daughter-in-law becomes the most
salient character, who has the most control over the flow of events. This
is reflected by the use of the speaker deixis pronouns ""ayya [2] and [4],474chapter fourteenwhereas Leli°a is referred to by default demonstratives, viz. ""ay [3] and
[5], and the attributive demonstrative in ""5-Leli°a.

her return? She closed the door and in the middle of the house
she made a fire. . . . The Leli°a came. She was all (made of) fat,
fat, oil. . . . She (the daughter-in-law) was constantly taking the iron
bars and putting them into her, until she killed her. She killed her,
and she (Leli°a) remained there.’ (A19:1–6)
A further example is the extract in (34), in which the protagonist Xano
is referred to by a speaker deixis demonstrative [2] and subsequently by
a default demonstrative [3]. This can be correlated with a difference in
discourse prominence. The section beginning with the speaker deixis
demonstrative [2] is a foregrounded section that advances the narrative.
The following section with the default form [3] supplies elaborative background information, which recapitulates an earlier, previously mentioned
event. It is worth noting that the clause with the default pronoun [1],
which refers to the king, also conveys repetitive background material,
since it comes immediately after a speech of the king in which he reports
his dream:
(34) ""aw-[1]mtunéle ""aw-xèlma qa-d-ó Xáno Lapzèrin.} ""áwwa [2] mère
b-àlaha} har-xá-m6ndi ""ì° b-áyya dúk°a t-íle wìra.} ""áw [3] xzèle ""o-dídwa
""7ka wìrre.} ‘He (the king) told the dream to Xano the Golden Hand.
He (Xano) said (to himself ) ‘By God, there must be something
in this place where it entered’. He (Xano) had seen where the fly
had entered.’ (A11:9)the syntax of nominals475Similarly in (35) the speaker deixis demonstrative [1] is in a clauses
that initiates a section describing a foreground event. The default dexis
demonstrative [2], which refers to the same character, can be interpreted
as elaborative information, which supplements the previously described
event rather than advancing the narrative:
(35) ""áwwa [1] b-l7le qìm5le.} gáw‰a díya mqulèbz6lle dèry6lle gawàya.} ""áw
[2] píša b-áy-gota xèt5le.} ‘He got up in the night. He rolled over her
husband and put him in the middle. He came to be on the other
side.’ (A30:53)
In constructions expressing a contrastive opposition between two items, the
two different demonstratives are used to separate distinctly the two items,
since they present them with different virtual spatial locations in the staging of the situation. In (37) and (38) the demonstratives express associative
anaphora. The ‘boys’ in (37) are typically associated with a school and the
table and its sides in (38) are associated with the act of sitting:
(36) ""5-dán6 t-ìla ‰íše,} kút-xa gu-šwí°6t gàne,} ""áyya gu-qáßr6t bába dìya,} ""áw
gu-‘ádre dìye} ‘When they woke up, each in their own bed, she in
the palace of her father and he in his tent . . .’ (A4:5)
(37) bróna díya gu-m6drása kút-yum y-awéwa mxáya l-aw-yàla,} šqála ‘ánta
d-àwwa,} šrà†a m6ndiyáne.} ‘Her son everyday in school would beat
one child, take the bag of another, tear things.’ (A14:5)
(38) holá-""6°ye tìwe,} báxta tíwta l-àyya-got6t m¶s,} ""u-gáw‰a tíwa l-ày-gota.}
‘They came and sat down, the wife sitting on this side of the table
and the husband sitting on the other side.’ (A4:57)
The virtual spatial separation is sometimes enhanced by using spatial
adverbs, e.g.
(39) díw6n t-xále díye hóla dwìqta.} ""áyya díw6n làxx5la} ""aw-gàrele.} ‘The
meeting room of his uncle is full. The meeting room is here and
that is its roof.’ (A23:14)
The speaker deixis demonstratives are sometimes used primarily to express
close emotional engagement with the referent with an evaluative sense,
which may be negative or positive. This is the case in (40)–(42), which
are extracts from direct speech. This speech is uttered by the speakers to476chapter fourteenthemselves in the absence of the referent of the nominal. The demonstratives, therefore, are not anaphoric nor are they used to point the attention
of a hearer to an item in the extra-linguistic situation:
(40) ""áyya xmàrta!} ‘That she-ass!’ (A10:10)
(41) mo-‘ára t-óð6x †la-d-áyya qá†u t-la ""axlàl5ni?} ‘What solution can we
find for this cat so that it does not eat us?’ (A44:1)
(42) b-álaha hóle híw6lle rèsqa d-áwwa gáw‰a ‘By God, he has provided the
sustenance of this husband (of mine).’ (A10:7)
Speaker deixis demonstratives are occasionally used with a nominal that
introduces a new referent into the discourse, when the speaker has a
particular personal interest in the referent. In (43), for example, a speaker
deixis demonstrative is used with the word ‘bridge’, which does not yet
exist in the extra-linguistic situation, nor has it been mentioned in the
preceding discourse. The speaker, however, proposes building such a
bridge. In (44) the speaker has a strong personal interest in the pot of
gold, which she introduces here for the first time in her speech to her
neighbour, although the object itself is not visible in the speech situation.
In English such demonstratives are most naturally translated by the indefinite article, though in some contexts a translation with a demonstrative
is also possible:
(43) xàli} lá ""awðèxle ""áwwa gêšra} šáwr6x réša réša d-ánna mìya?} ‘Uncle,
should we not make a bridge for it so that we can cross over this
water?’ (A17:3)
(44) xá-duk°a hon-xzí°a hátxa dàwe,} ""áyya qadált6 dàwe.} ‘In a certain
place I have found gold coins like this, a/this pot of gold coins.’
(A10:9)
A demonstrative may have an anaphoric function when the referent in
question is visible in the speech situation. In (45), for example, the function of the default demonstrative ""an- is to indicate that the arrows which
the speaker shows to the hearer are those that have been mentioned
previously in the discourse history. It does not point the hearer’s attention
to the referent. This is done by the presentative particle ho. In (46) the
speaker deixis subject pronoun ""anna points to the ring and scarf in the
speech situation, but the default demonstrative ""ani in the predicate has an
anaphoric function binding the reference to the preceding discourse:the syntax of nominals477(45) °éli hó ""an-†¬á ger6-qêšta.} ‘I’ve come back and here are the three arrows
of a bow (to which reference was made earlier).’ (A12:46)
(46) ""ína ""áyya ""isèq°a ""u-yalèxta d-ˆnila?} hóla ""isêq°a,} hóla yalêxta.} má†o mdaglènna gàni} t-ámr6n ""ánna l7la ""àni.} ‘But whose is this ring and scarf ?
Here is a ring and here is a scarf. How can I make myself lie and
say that these are not those (belonging to the girl I mentioned)?’
(A26:12)
The far deixis demonstrative is occasionally used to refer to items that
are internal to the discourse. The usual context for this is where two or
more members of a set are presented in a contrastive opposition. One
member is typically presented with either a speaker deixis or default
deixis demonstrative and the other and any further members are given
a far deixis demonstrative. The function of the far deixis demonstrative
is to separate the members of the set clearly in the virtual space of the
discourse, e.g.
(47) mattíwala gu-d-7 m6ššára xá, tré, †¬à°a.} man7wa hal-""êßra.} ""èßra gu-d-àyya,}
""èßra gu-d-yàha,} ""èßra gu-d-yáha xèta,} hàtxa.} ‘They would plant
them in the paddy field, one, two, three and count up to ten. Ten
in this (row), ten in that one, ten in that other one, and so forth.’
(B7:13)
(48) gu-m>˙àll-ži} kút-yum gánu k°7°a d-àwwa,} ""7-ga y-azèlwa féka d->wàha.}
‘Every day in the neighbourhood he would steal the chicken of
one person, then go (and steal) the fruit of another.’ (A14:7)
(49) brōn-málka tíw5le l-d-a-tàxta.} ""u-xá-w>zīr díye r6š-d-áwwa-kursa}
xa-r6š-d->wàha.} ‘The son of the king sat on the throne, one

‘They went and kept a guard in that far corner, and one in that
other corner.’ (A18:3)
Sometimes only one member of the set is explicitly mentioned, the other(s)
being implied, e.g.
(51) kút-xa †la-gáne šuréle dwàqa.} ßúdr6t S6ttìye} ""áwwa xálqa n‘ìlle,} Fárxo

"628chapter fifteen(13) ""5-màsta} ""i-d5ríla gu-gùða.} gúða mòdile?} ""íle gèld6t xa-hèyw6n.} ‘They put

the Ninevites is not a religious festival. It is a national festival.’
(B6:17)
Occasionally the independent copula with its own stress is placed after
the predicate, e.g.
(16) ""ána Qára Tè≥din ""íw6n.} ‘I am Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:68)
(17) ""ána brònux ""íw6n.} ‘I am your son.’ (A18:7)
(18) ""áw har-xá-mdi ""ìle.} ‘It is something.’ (A14:25)
15.3.1.3. Enclitic Copula Attached to the Subject
When the subject of the clause is high in topicality, the copula in some
instances does not stand independently with its own stress but rather is
cliticized to the subject, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)""áyy5la óìta.} ‘This is butter.’ (B6:41)
""u-""áyy5la kùlla.} ‘This is all (the story).’ (A4:24)
""áw-ile sí‰a bìya.} ‘It is tied to it.’ (B6:55)
xúwwele q†ìla!} ‘The snake is killed!’ (A24:42)These constructions share with the independent copula construction the
feature of having subjects with topical prominence. In the examples cited
above, the referent of the subject has been referred to in the immediately
preceding discourse where it is of central concern. The clauses are, however, unmarked with regard to the nature of the predicate, in that they
may express either a contingent or a permanent property of the subject.
They are also unmarked with regard to the communicative salience and
assertiveness of the proposition of the clause as a whole. This is shown
by the fact that the construction is used in interrogative clauses containing
interrogative words that are in the subject position, e.g.
(5)
(6)""7nile gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Who is in the house?’
""7nile zaqàra?} ‘Who is a weaver?’the syntax of verbs629Such constructions, therefore, are close in function to clauses with the
copula cliticized to the predicate, which are likewise unmarked with regard
to the nature of the predicate and the communicative salience of the clause.
They differ only in the marked status of the subject referent, in that this
must be an item that is topically prominent. The placement of the copula
on the interrogative subject as in (5) and (6) can be interpreted as a reflection of the topical prominence of the interrogative word. It is not topically
prominent by virtue of being informationally given, but rather since it is
what the question primarily requests information about.5 Moreover it has
a feature analogous to what has been described above as forward pointing
topicality. This is because the referent of the interrogative constituent is
typically expected to be identified in the subsequent discourse.
The notion of forward pointing topicality also explains the attachment
of the copula in (7) to the adverbial hád6x, which is linked as a correlative
to the following prepositional phrase:
(7) ""ítli ðá brat6t-màma} hád6x-ila š†rànta} max-d-àwwa yóma.} ‘I have a cousin.
She is as beautiful as this sun (lit. She is thus beautiful, like this
sun).’ (A7:17)
15.3.2. The Deictic Copula
As is the case with the independent basic copula, the deictic copula exhibits
certain restrictions with regard to the nature of the predicate and subject
and also with regard to the communicative salience of the proposition
expressed by the clause. It is generally used when the predicate expresses
a contingent situation that is not necessarily a permanent property of the
subject. It may be used without any other clause constituents to draw attention to the location of a referent in the current speech situation, e.g.
(1) mère kˆla tóto?} mère hòla.} ‘He said “Where is grandma?” He said
“There she is (as we speak).” ’ (A7:24)
In many cases it is combined with a locative adverbial in the predicate.
Examples from the text corpus:
(2) yoná°a hóla reše-reše-dìye.} ‘Doves are over him.’ (A25:58)5For the topicality of interrogative words see Steedman (2000: 659).","[666, 667, 668]"

(8) t-lá-hoya qàr°-6ll6x} ‘so that you are not cold’ (A20:2)
Nominal complements of verbs of speech (1)–(2) and recipients or beneficiaries (3)–(4) are normally expressed by phrases containing the prepositions
ta-/†la- or qa- rather than l-. The adnominal equivalents of constructions
such as those in (5)–(8), however, generally have l-.
(iii) ‘Upon, over, against’
Location over a physical object is not normally expressed with a pronominal ""6ll- phrase, although l- as an adnominal preposition is often used with
this sense. The normal means of expressing this relation with pronominal
complements is by phrases consisting of the preposition reš- ‘upon’, e.g. réša
‘on it (f.)’ (A27:17), réše dìye ‘on him’ (A31:10), b-réša ‘over them’ (A25:48),
b-rèša ‘on it’ (A12:47).
In a few contexts a pronominal ""6ll- phrase is, nevertheless, the historical
reflex of a phrase with the preposition *'al-. These tend to be restricted
to relations of an abstract or non-physical nature, such as (1)–(7), or
constructions such as (8)–(12), which express location on the surface but
not necessarily above the item in question, often in relation to liquids
(11)–(12):
(1) šák6n ""êllux.} ‘I’ll make a complaint about you.’ (A22:46)
(2) hótu pšàma ""èlla díya.} ‘You are sad over it.’ (A5:10)
(3) kúlla ""êlli.} ‘It is all on me (= I shall pay for everything).’ (A8:38)
(4) l5le-""7ba ""6llì?} ‘Would not that be a shame on me?’ (A8:55)
(5) kúlla q6m-malušíla ""èlla dìya.} ‘They put all of them (her clothes) on
her.’ (A4:20)
(6) lá-q5m6t ""6llèy.} ‘You will not rise against them.’ (A8:95)

(12) qímle murèsle hátxa míya ""6llèy.} ‘He sprinkled water on them like this.’
(B6:11)We could include here a construction such as (13), which expresses an
external quality:
(13) šúpr6 dúnye hóle ""6lla-dìya.} ‘She had the beauty of the world.’ (A13:11)
(iv) Direct Object
Compound verbal forms consisting of a resultative particle or an infinitive
express a pronominal object either by L-suffixes or by a pronominal suffix
attached to the preposition ""6ll-. The use of the ""6ll- phrase is obligatory
when the participle or infinitive does not have a copula enclitic, e.g. hóle
q†íl6lle ‘He has killed him’, but is optional if the construction has a copula
enclitic. Details of the use of ""6ll- with the compound verbal forms are
given in §8.19.4. On rare occasions it is used to mark the pronominal
direct object of a q†ille form (§8.19.2.). It should be noted that this usage of
the prepositional phrase differs from others in that the phrase is generally
bound to the verbal form prosodically and does not stand independently
with its own stress, e.g. mútt6t6lle ‘You put him’ (A22:39), prìm6n6lla ‘I cut it
(f.)’ (A22:9), bì°6llela (bi°a-6lle-ila) ‘She loved him’ (A4:12). This is a property it shares with L-suffixes, which likewise cannot be used with prosodic
independence from the verb. Furthermore, the adnominal preposition
l- does not function as a direct object marker.
(v) Complement of verbs
Verbs that take l- as their complement before nouns have an ""6ll- phrase
when the noun is pronominalized. This phrase has prosodic independence. Given what has been said in the previous section, this prosodicthe syntax of prepositions809feature should be regarded a reflection of the fact that they are not direct
objects, e.g.
(1)
(2)náše là h>m6níwa ""èlle díye.} ‘People did not believe him.’ (A48:1)
ham-mßawòre ""èlle díye.} ‘He curses him again.’ (A17:3)
16.3. ˇLA, TA-16.3.1. Direction
The most frequent usage of this preposition is to express the direction,
objective or beneficiary of an action or situation without necessarily any
movement being involved, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)híw6lla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘They gave the pot to the mullah.’ (A5:8)
hálla júllux †làli.} ‘Give your clothes to me.’ (A7:18)
maláxa mère †la-ràbb6n.} ‘The angel said to the monk.’ (A15:7)
""u-°élux mdagóle †làli.} ‘and you came lying to me.’ (A1:23)
wídla ""ixàla} †la-yàla.} ‘She made food for the young man.’
(A21:22)
(6) ""u-†lálux lan-šwíqa ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘and for you I have left nothing.’
(A2:11)
(7) b8y6n msóq6n xákma m6ndiyàne} †la-bˆ°a.} ‘I want to buy a few things
for the house.’ (A22:12)
(8) ""ítl6n xá-m6ndi b8y6x t-oðèxxe †làl6x.} ‘There is something that we want
to do for you.’ (A4:48)
(9) ""áyya šwí°a †láli ""u-†làlux-ila.} ‘This bed is for me and you.’ (A22:32)
(10) lá p5š6x †la-x>dàya.} ‘We shall not stay for lunch.’ (A21:30)
(11) málla píšla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘The cooking pot became the mullah’s.’
(A5:10)
(12) †la-mò wídlux hátxa bíyi?} ‘Why (literally: for what) have you done
this to me?’ (A15:14)
16.3.2. Destination
It is occasionally used after verbs or movement or conveyance expressing
destination, e.g.","[845, 846, 847, 848]"
