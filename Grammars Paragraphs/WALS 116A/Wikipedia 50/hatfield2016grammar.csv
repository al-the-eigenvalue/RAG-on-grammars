In addition to the interrogative clitic =ka, there is a second interrogative clitic =a.
Like =ka, it attaches to the final word of the sentence, typically the verb. It has its own
stress in addition to the stress appropriate to the word it attaches to. When it occurs in305a polar question, it signals that there is an expected answer 'yes' to the question, as in
(260) and (261).

When used in a content question, the clitic =a indicates that the speaker is

Interrogative phrases in content questions appear in situ, in the same position as
corresponding noninterrogative phrases. Table 46 lists the question words and their
word class. Following that, each word is described and exemplified below in the order
that it appears in the table. Those words with hyphens can occur with clitics or suffixes.

2SG who=INT
Who are you?
The interrogative pronoun em sometimes occurs with a noun phrase clitic, as in (271). In

nurkuminga=DUELICThe use of a noun phrase clitic appears to be conditioned by the assumptions the
speaker makes about the answer to the question. In (271), the use of the masculine
clitic indicates that the speaker is assuming that the answer involves a male. In (272),
the use of the dual clitic indicates that the speaker expects a dual answer. If the speaker
has no such assumptions, em will be used without a noun phrase clitics, as in (272) to
(270) above.
The interrogative pronoun em has a slightly irregular possessive form emoko. The
form has the same properties as non-interrogative possessive pronouns. It can host
person/number/gender clitics as appropriate. In (273) to (276), it precedes the noun and
thus appears without a noun phrase clitic.

conventionalized noises that speakers make for fixed meanings. An attempt has been
made to render these sounds into writing by using some of the typical English spelling
conventions. This is not meant to be an official representation, but rather an attempt to
accurately convey the sound. The known sounds are listed in Table 51.

Furthermore, when people see each other at a distance, but will not get close
enough to speak in normal tones, there are some conventional ways of yelling. These
include lengthening the vowel(s) of each word to make it easier to shout. It is also quite
common to end each utterance with a long /o/ vowel sound with a falling intonation.
This indicates that a particular segment is over and the listener can then verify that he
heard everything and continue listening, ask for repetition, or make his own comment.","[412, 413]"

"302In other words, it only appears on predicates. It seems that the predicate is always or
almost always last in questions; i.e. no other constituents of the sentence will follow the
predicate.
When the subject is second person singular, there is generally no overt marking of
the sentence as a question; I represent this in the examples by '=ø', glossed '2SG.INT'.
This is illustrated in (245) to (250). Note that when this happens, the form of the verb is
still distinct from that in a corresponding declarative sentence in that there will be a
tense suffix but no subject suffix on the verb;. This contrasts with clauses with a subject
that it not second person singular, where we get both subject suffix and the clitic =ka.
For this reason, one might posit a zero interrogative clitic in these sentences with
second person singular subjects.

It is possible for a noun phrase to consist of just a possessive pronoun, as long as the
context supports the utterance. An example of this would be in an answer to a question
about who is the owner of a particular item.
Similarly, it is possible for noun phrases to contain two or more words or
constituents that normally serve as modifiers of nouns, without there being a noun in
the noun phrase. Some examples are givenin (365) to (369).

I refer to the forms with the suffix -tn as first person singular imperatives, even
though the semantics of these forms is rather different from the semantics of first
person singular imperative pronouns (and what have been labeled first person singular
imperatives in other languages). I do so partly because the suffix -tn is in paradigmatic
opposition to the suffix -ta, both suffixes occur on verbs without any other suffix, and
because both begin with a /t/. In addition, although different from the first person
singular imperative pronoun, the use of the suffix -tn does place the speaker under an
obligation to perform the action in question, just as some uses of second-person
imperatives place the hearer under an obligation to perform the action in question.
Examples illustrating the tn-imperative are given in (109) and (110).

want6069The use of the tn-imperative means that the speaker is declaring that they intend to
or will do something imminently.It does not, however, obligate a person to do
something immediately. That is, it is not infelicitous for a person to use this form and235then to fail to immediately do the thing they have mentioned. This is analogous to the
use of the future of today (see §6.2.3).
On the other hand, a person who uses this form and then fails to do what they have
said at all will incur some social displeasure. The use of this form is in some ways a
promise to do the thing spoken of. The implication is that the speaker will perform the
act in the near future, though it is possible that events will prevent the person from
doing so and they will then complete the action later on.","[250, 251, 252]"

"31At the time of death, there is a period of mourning in which the mourners do no
work (initially) and do a little bit more as time goes on. The body of the deceased was
traditionally wrapped in limbum bark (a type of palm tree) and hung from a tree deep in
the jungle in a place reserved for this. Now, bodies are buried in keeping with the
Western custom. This period ends after two to three months at which time there is a
feast. The extended family goes out hunting for pigs in addition to preparing sago and
yams. The feast is presented to the mourners as a symbol that it is time to resume their
normal daily duties. If a husband dies, the wife typically does very little, including
avoiding bathing. If a wife dies, a husband will wail and refuse to eat. He may leave the
village and stay somewhere in the jungle by himself. There is not a substantial amount
of mourning for very young children, as death in childhood historically was quite
common. If there is an unexpected death of a healthy adult, there is a ritual undertaken
to determine the (presumed malevolent) source. The body is placed in its limbum
basket and tapped with the stick of the same tree. The people ask questions pursuant to
the death, “was it poison?, was it from this or that village?” etc. The basket then starts
shaking in response to the questions and moving to point in the direction of the poison.
When the culprit is identified, the people confront him and work out a compensatory
payment for the death. See also §2.3.6 for the connection between life and death.","[47, 48]"

designed to allow for additional data collection. Below are lists of the main consultants
who provided data, time, generosity and hospitality to me while learning Mehek. The
primary consultants are the ones who provided ongoing and/or daily time for long
periods. The secondary consultants provided large amounts of data over a fixed time
period, either hours or multiple times over several days. In addition to those listed

Each glossed example used in this grammar is followed by a four digit number or
the letters “ELIC” or “OVH”. For numbers, the first digit represents which of the seven
notebooks the data are recorded in and the last three digits represent the page or story
number from that notebook. The letters “ELIC” are short for “elicitation” and represent
an example from direct elicitation. The letters “OVH” are short for “overheard” and
represent an example heard in natural speech.
Proper names (including those for people, plants and animals) are glossed in English
with the same word used in Mehek where an English or Tok Pisin equivalent does not
exist.xvAbstract
This is a grammar which provides a detailed linguistic description of the phonology,
morphology, syntax, discourse, lexicon and cultural environment of the Mehek language
and its speakers. Mehek is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea by approximately
6300 people. It belongs to the Sepik language family, Tama branch. The theoretical
background employed is Basic Linguistic Theory. Mehek shares general features with
many non-Austronesian Papuan languages, including: a relatively simple phonological
system; verb-final word order, typically SOV; agglutinative verbal morphology; and the
morphology of other word classes is relatively simple.xviChapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview
Mehek (ISO code nux) is a language of the Tama branch of the Sepik family spoken
in Sandaun Province of Papua New Guinea. There are approximately 6300 speakers
(Gordon 2005) spread out over an area of roughly 65 square miles. The data for this
study were gathered in three field trips during the summers of 2010, 2012 and 2014.
The total length of the trips was nine months and time was spent in each of the Mehekspeaking villages, though the primary location was the village of Wilwil (see §2.1 below).
There is no prior published grammatical information on Mehek, though some
neighboring languages have had partial Bible translations done or a grammatical sketch
done.
The goal of the present grammar is to provide a detailed linguistic description of the
phonology, morphology, syntax, discourse, lexicon and cultural environment of Mehek
and its speakers. In the present chapter, information on the language and speakers is
given and the following areas will be discussed: linguistic scene and language vitality
(§1.1), genetic classification of Mehek (§1.2), previous research (§1.3), dialects (§1.4),
fieldwork (§1.5) and theoretical background (§1.6). Chapter 2 will discuss topics relevant
to culture and environment. After that, chapter 3 will provide a brief grammatical sketch
of the language and its primary features. Chapters 4-11 will discuss linguistic topics of
the language, specifically: phonology (chapter 4), word classes (chapter 5), nouns and1noun phrases (chapter 6), verbs and verb phrases (chapter 7), clause types (chapter 8),
clausal relations (chapter 9), discourse and paralanguage (chapter 10), and lexical fields
(chapter 11). Following these chapters are several appendices of additional information
and reference. These include sample texts (Appendix A); multi-lingual dictionaries:

"9.1 Interjections
Several word forms are used as interjections. These words do not occur in any
syntactic position and are typically used at the beginning of the clause in which they
appear. They are invariant in form, though nango 'maybe' can be the host of a noun
phrase clitic. Table 49 lists some of these interjections.

an English name, Pidgin name (after the source language, Tok Pisin), or Christian name.
These names are all typical English names which have been incorporated due to
extensive contact with the West over the last 100 years (and perhaps the difficulty of
foreigners in pronouncing native names).
9.7.2 Bad Name sir kaha
The most commonly used form after the given name is the sir kaha which means
'bad name'. The name itself does not have negative connotations, nor is it considered
rude to use the name. The name is considered “bad” because it is used when the
speaker believes that the addressee has behaved badly. Its use reflects the fact that its
owner has violated some social convention. The choice to use the sir kaha is a reflection
of the speaker’s attitude toward the addressee. Typically, however, the speaker will not
be angry with the addressee, but will be using this variant to help enforce some social
norm which the addressee has violated. In some contexts, the sir kaha is similar to
nicknames in the English speaking world and can similarly be used affectionately (akin to
calling friends by names that highlight negative personal qualities). The sir kaha is still392used widely by most speakers and most speakers will know the kaha form of most given
names, whether or not they know someone who has that name (this is not the case with
the other name variants, see §9.7.3 - §9.7.5).
The most common usage of the sir kaha is by parents towards their children. As
children age, the likelihood that they will be addressed by their sir kaha is lessened. The
purpose of the sir kaha, the speakers say, is to “spoil the name” of someone when they
have done something wrong. When the ordinary given name consists of morphemes,
the typical method of forming the sir kaha is to replace one of the morphemes of the
given name with a different morpheme. This has the effect of changing or altogether
removing the meaning of that person’s name. For any given name, there is a unique sir
kaha. Therefore, all people with the same given name will always be addressed by the
same variant form in the sir kaha.
There are a couple of less formal ways to form the sir kaha of a name. One is to
simply shorten the name by replacing the second morpheme of the name with /ks/,
which has the sense of friendly ribbing. Example (46) gives two examples of this.
(46) nanda timba becomes nandeks
'older.brother not.have'solaku becomes solaks
(no meaning)A more affectionate shortening of the name involves dropping final syllable(s) and
stretching out the remaining final vowel. In the case of final /u/, this often transitions to
/i/ as in the second example in (47).","[407, 408, 409]"

"9.6 Gesture
There are several gestures which are commonly used among Mehek speakers and
which were observed to be consistent from speaker to speaker and from context to
context. A fuller study of gesture is needed to determine the full range and usage of
gestures, but Table 50 gives a fairly complete summary of the most common gestures
observed.

when laughingTable 50: Mehek Gestures9.7 Personal Names
The system of personal names in Mehek presents a unique system where each
person has, in addition to their given name, additional names uniquely tied to the given
name which serve as affective markers of the speaker’s attitude toward the addressee,
be it happy or upset. These are the so-called “good name” and “bad name”. Not only
does every person have these names, but the culture provides people with names in389two further modalities: song and whistle. Just as the spoken names indicate the attitude
of the speaker, so does the song. However, the purpose of the whistle is long-distance
or out-of-sight communication; it is possible to communicate with someone over great
distances simply by whistling their unique name. The addressee has a limited repertory
of possible responses, as the whistles are mainly a component of the naming system
and not a wider method of communication. A full listing of personal names is given in
Appendix G. Appendices H and I contain additional information about names.
9.7.1 Given Name sir
The given name, or sir, is assigned at birth and the choice ultimately rests with the
mother. There is a set of given names from which to choose when a child is born,
though it is possible to create a new name for one's child. None of the names is
associated with a particular gender. Some of them do have tendencies toward one
gender or the other, though this is not a strong tendency, but only a “feeling” on the
parts of some speakers. (This is similar to unisex names in English that have gender
biases, such as Tony or Kelly.) This means that a female child can be (and often is)
named after the mam (the maternal uncle).
An important concept in the kin system is that of the yowul. A yowul is both a kin
term for the children of a male’s younger siblings (see §10.1), as well as 'namesake'.
Because the mam will at least advise (if not direct) his younger sisters on how to name
her children, a mam will also often become a yowul 'namesake' of one of his nieces or390nephews. This type of naming is an honor, and the mam will often only be the namesake
of one person in the family. Additionally, the mam is responsible throughout his life to
look after and support his sisters’ children and their families, whether or not they are his
namesake. This includes helping out with construction, gardening, or financial assistance
for school fees. The mam’s role continues even after his nieces and nephews marry,
though in a reduced capacity.
Because of the tendency of most people to have a yowul within the family, a certain
subset of the total inventory of names tends to stay within families, but there is no
social requirement to do this. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on who can take a
particular name. Names are not secret or private, nor is there any reluctance for a
person to share his name with an outsider on first meeting them.
Names are always polysyllabic and typically bimorphemic. A majority of the names
are composed of two morphemes that have independent status and a (relatively)
transparent meaning. There are also some names where only part of the name contains
an independent morpheme or where the whole name has no identifiable morphemes or
meaning. There is no sense in which a name describes a child’s characteristics or
prescribes a destiny. Some names have negative connotations, but those connotations
do not reflect poorly on the child. The examples in (45) are a sample of personal names,
but for a full listing, see Appendix G.","[405, 406, 407]"

dependency status of the second clause to the first. (This is real-world, rather than
grammatical dependency.) The first type listed, conjunction, merely requires the
juxtaposition of the two clauses and no further ordering or dependency is implied
(though these may both be implied by context). Going down the list, the different clause
types impose restrictions, first on the temporal relationship, then on the dependency
status of the second clause. The final type listed, conditional, requires not only a
temporal sequence and a dependency relationship, but the further requirement that the
first clause itself may not actually occur.
The syntax for the clausal particles yombo 'simultaneous', yungu 'dependent', and
rokor 'causal' relationships is similar. Unlike the verbal aspectual particles (§7.2), these
particles are not affixes, but are instead separate words with their own stress and (in
some cases), capable of taking their own agreement markers. As for the syntax of the
clauses themselves, in the default, unmarked context, they each require the verb
immediately preceding to have no inflection and to end in the gerundial suffix –m (see
§8.3.3). It is also possible for the preceding verb to have no inflection when imperative,
as well as the conditional marker if the speaker wishes to emphasize that the action has
not yet happened. The syntax of the two clauses linked by a particle is the same in the
case of all three. These cases are summarized in Table 48 below. The abbreviations used
include V for verb and INFL for full verbal inflection.","[357, 358]"

the use of finite verbs lacking tense/mood or subject suffixes is somewhat exceptional. I
discuss the range of possible forms of verbs, including nonfinite forms, in more detail in
§6.7.
§6.1 describes the subject suffixes, §6.2 the tense suffixes, §6.3 the mood suffixes
and §6.4 the aspect suffixes. §6.5 and §6.6 describe the imperative and negative forms
of the verb, respectively, though the latter is discussed more fully in Chapter 7. §6.7

"36While magic is only infrequently called upon, spirits are a much more regular part of
people’s day-to-day lives. Every time a man or woman dies, their spirit (Tok Pisin tewel)
lives on and inhabits the area around which they died. There is no one spot particular to
each; they simply dwell in the jungle around their village. This is near their ancestral
land to which they belong. In the case of women who marry to another village, they can
split their time. There is an area in the jungle where they can congregate, though it is
unknown where and is nearly impossible to see them there even if found. They
occasionally can appear in human form, though they are most often invisible. When
they do appear as humans, they may be like smoke or may be solid. If they appear on
the road, they will not speak; that is how you know they are a spirit. In times of trouble,
you can call on your deceased parents or grandparents for help. You simply speak aloud
to them and they will appear to you when you are alone. They can materialize or come
through a wall, though physical appearance is rather uncommon. Typically, they will
speak to you in a dream or to a family member in their dream. If one ancestor does not
answer, you can try others. Whoever helps you will be the primary one you call on in the
future. Women who have allegiances to two different clans can call on either set of
ancestors. The spirits are good-natured and want to help for the most part. If you are ill
or injured, they may spontaneously speak to you to tell you if you were poisoned or if
you had some sort of bad behavior which brought it on. It is unclear if spirits live on
eternally or if only a few generations are able to be called upon. If the latter, it is unclear
if the others simply can't be called or if they are gone altogether. With the initial37appearance of white-skinned people fifty years ago, it was commonly thought that they
were either the ghosts of departed loved ones or ancestor spirits. This belief is less
widely held today, though there are still many people who subscribe to it. However, it is
still widely believed that it is important to avoid incurring the wrath of spirits or
sorcerers while travelling. To avoid the former, one must pay close attention to the path
being travelled and to not laugh and be too easy-going, lest one fall prey to being lured
to a spirit’s home or wander off the path and be taken advantage of. To avoid the latter,
it is important to not leave any scraps of food on the roadside. Since sorcerers need a
person’s personal effects to cast most spells, preventing them from acquiring them is
paramount. This is more likely while travelling since sorcerers from one’s own village
typically will not harm one.
In addition to spirits of the dead, there are also eternal spirits called maure (Tok
Pisin masalai). Each one is particular to a clan and has a particular abode in the jungle
near the clan's traditional ground. They are the legendary founders of their clan and
have magical powers, particularly the power to appear as different entities, both
animate and inanimate. They typically have a particular animal whose form they prefer.
They have volition and will interact with humanity. It is forbidden to cross into their land
or to make noise or otherwise disrupt their area. Whether intentional or not, these
interferences will anger the spirits. Once angered, they will have revenge, typically by
causing sickness, injury, or death. When any of these strikes, it is necessary to find out if
it was caused by a person who wished you ill (possibly due to some prior behavior of
38yours) or if you angered a masalai. Masalai-induced punishments will be fairly
immediate; minor transgressions will result in minor punishments. Apologies and
offerings to the masalai will appease them and end the punishment. Often a tewel can
be called upon to determine the source and resolution of the punishment. They are
usually invisible and remain in their own areas. They often inhabit artifacts in the jungle,
such as trees, lakes, and vines, in addition to appearing as animals. When a person has
left the village for an extended period (often for travel), that person will be seen in
around the village, but will not speak. This is the masalai of that person's clan appearing
as a reminder of his own existence and to not forget him.
The mythical origins of the Mehek-speaking people are two-fold. There is the
creation of the world, and then there is the genesis of the Mehek-speaking people
themselves. The world was created by maure sofo, an ancestor who assumed the shape
of a snake. The Mehek speakers themselves initially dwelt underground and were still
humans, but resembled pigs. One of their number found a hole to the surface and came
outside and explored. After several of these trips, he told his fellows to come with him.
As they lived on the surface, experienced the sun and ate the food, they gradually
assumed the completely human forms they have now. Those who were afraid to come
above ground gradually became what are now pigs and live as pigs to this day.","[52, 53, 54, 55]"

Negation is expressed in a number of different ways. The primary negative
morpheme is an invariant word iki.15 Most negative non-imperative clauses contain this
word, though it occasionally co-occurs with a suffix -nak on the verb or a clause-final
negative word mehek. There is a prohibitive word mana that is used in negative
imperative sentences (§7.8.3).
7.8.1 iki 'not' and the negative verbal suffix -nak
The default non-imperative negative clause involves just the negative word iki. It
always precedes the final (finite) verb, though not necessarily immediately before the
verb. It typically precedes material other than a subject that is not a pronoun. Example
(321) illustrates iki preceding the adverbial word anganambu 'fast'.

intending to do something later in the day who, for whatever reason, cannot or does
not follow through, would not be bound by the use of that tense or incur the wrath of
his/her fellows. The use of the remote future −ka is the default future: a speaker
wishing to remain agnostic about whether or not he/she will do something or about
whether something will happen, will use the remote future. This does not mean that the
speaker will not perform the act the same day. However, when a speaker does use the
remote future with a first person singular subject, it is often because he/she does not
wish to commit at that moment and is also likely not to do it soon. Examples (43) and

In the first person singular, there is a an irregular form for future today. Namely
instead of -kya plus -yun, we get a single morpheme -kun that codes both future today
and first person singular. Formally, this means that there is a contrast in the first person
between -kun and -kayun, which resembles the contrast in the present between -yun
and -yayun. However, this distinction in the present is a distinction that does not arise in
second and third person, while the distinction in the future between -kun and -kayun is221simply a formal difference between the two future tenses in the first person singular. In
other words, semantically, there is the same two-way distinction in the first person
singular for future that there is for second and third person. Examples (45) and (46)
illustrate this first person singular future today suffix −kun.

sit-PAST2-3PL6.1.1 First Person Marking without Present Tense
As noted above, there are two first person singular forms, −yun and −n. The former
is the only form which can be used in any tense and it has the same form as the 1SG
predicate clitic (§4.2.2). There are in fact three possible ways to express the first person
in the present tense: (1) using the suffix -n without a tense suffix preceding it; (2) using
the suffix -yun by itself, without a tense suffix preceding it; and (3) using the suffix -yun,
but in combination with the present tense suffix -ya. In other words, the suffix −yun can
occur with or without the present tense suffix −ya, while the suffix −n must occur
without the present tense suffix. It is not possible to have more than one method of
expressing any of the other tenses, as tense and person suffix are obligatory for all other
persons and tenses. In the two cases where the present tense suffix −ya is not present,
the first person suffixes code both tense and person, PRES.1SG.
The factors governing the choice between these three ways of expressing present
tense with a first person singular subject are not entirely clear, though I have identified213some factors that seem to correlate with particular methods. First, the use of -yun by
itself correlates with habitual meaning, as in (13) and (14).

"43Because all members of society are capable of providing for their own ongoing
support in all aspects of life (food, housing, transportation, etc.), selling goods for
money is purely a supplemental activity; no money is necessary to maintain the lifestyle
that most people pursue. However, there are small trade stores in the villages which sell
a variety of Western goods. These goods primarily consist of food items (canned meats,
rice, cooking oil and crackers); basic kitchen implements (pots, pans, plates and
utensils), household goods (sleeping mats, buckets, matches, towels), and other useful
tools (bleach and other similar products). These trade stores are stocked either through
purchases made from the larger stores in Nuku, or from the well-stocked coastal towns
(Wewak and Aitape being the most accessible). Families with financial means often will
set up these small trade stores as a way to provide a service to their community as well
as to make a small profit and to finance continued stocking of the store.
There are certain manufactured goods that most, if not all, families possess and in
many respects cannot live without. That is, they have completely incorporated these
products into their daily or regular lives and have forgotten the former ways of doing
things that the new goods have made possible. Some examples of this include metal
knives (these have been used for many decades now, replacing stone axes), clothes,
metal cooking implements (replacing clay pots garfu and au which are no longer
commonly made), cooking oil, salt, radios and flashlights. The latter has also replaced
the traditional method of night lighting, burning dried fronds from coconut palms (suwa
tikwasa), though many people do still practice this technique.
44There are several pieces of Western technological concepts that have permeated
life, many of them offering only minor improvements. Some of these include windows,
door locks, linear time, and scheduling. There is a traditional style of door which
involves putting slats crosswise in a frame, but this is only practiced now in temporary
jungle camps. Houses and kitchen houses now have doors with hinges and locks, both of
which must be purchased. Furthermore, people with more money are able to purchase
hammers and nails to build their houses, and this technology has altered the way
traditional homes are constructed. Most people still build in the traditional way,
however. This method involves constructing three rows of posts, the central row being
about 25% taller than the outer rows. Holes for the posts are dug with a knife and then
the posts are shoved into them until they remain strong. Crossbeams are attached for
the walls and the roof, and then a particular part of the coconut palm is cut to make
slats, which form the walls. The roof is made from sago palm leaves which are folded
and sewn together into panels, which are staggered like shingles. They are very effective
at keeping out the rain. No windows are typically built if a hammer and nails are not
available. Houses are long and dark; however, most people do not spend much time
during the day inside. Women do stay inside the kitchen house cooking, and the house
fills up with smoke and is heavily deposited with soot. This is a primary reason reported
for why many people have poor vision in old age.
As for time, people are now aware of dates and use them to varying levels of
precision. The day of the week is not greatly relevant to most people, though knowing
45when it is Sunday is important for church attendance (see §2.4.2) and most people
generally know which day of the week it is. Otherwise, the month and year, while
known by some, are not necessary for daily use. Some people do have calendar books
and mark off the days, but this is not an important task for most village work. Big
celebrations (again, typically related to church) will be scheduled on a particular date
which people will be able to recite. But it is only as the date gets close enough to refer
to as happening within a week or so, will the majority of people know that the
celebration is near.
2.4.2 Christianity
Most people are at least nominally religious, always a branch of Christianity. There
are five main Christian groups in operation in this region, the Catholic Church and four
different Protestant groups. The latter are: Christian Brothers Church (CBC), Nupela Laip
bilong Olgeta (New Life for All: an evangelical group developed by a native of the area),
Foursquare and Assembly of God (AOG). They are broadly similar, though people are
usually quite loyal to the branch they adhere to. This is often an accident of location, as
a missionary belonging to one group will settle in one part of a village and evangelize
the people nearby, while a different missionary will settle in a different, nearby location
at a different time. Nevertheless, though people will often make snide comments about
the other groups as not being “true” or “pure”, there is not much inter-group animosity46and most people are quite tolerant of divergent beliefs. This includes people who do not
attend a church of any kind.
Many people regularly attend Sunday church services, which are led by trained lay
people. Sunday is also a day often reserved for community meetings in which the men
gather and try to reach consensus on issues of importance. The people greatly desire
their language to be written so that a Bible translation can be made. It is a particularly
sore point to many Mehek people that there is a translation of the New Testament for
Mende, the people of Seim with whom there is some tension.
Pre-Christian beliefs still hold clear influences over most people (see §2.3.6 for a
description of these beliefs). The practice of cargo cults (Worsley 1957) is not known in
the Mehek-speaking area, though there is a belief that following Western ways is likely
to bring about more material benefit. Many people say that they are the “last place” in
Papua New Guinea (and by extension, the world) to receive development. They
regularly talk about how their houses, roads, etc. are nogut or bagarap (Tok Pisin for
'bad' and 'ruined', respectively). There is a hope that by worshipping (what is thought to
be the primary) Western god, development and material benefit will come in time. In
general, Christian beliefs are grafted on top of the old belief system and no
inconsistency is perceived; the belief in spirits is alive and well. The Christian god is
viewed as a more powerful entity than the native spirits, as being over and above them,47though still a separate entity from them. The native spirits still exist in the same way and
with the same powers as they always have.
2.4.3 Education
Education is widely available throughout the Mehek-speaking area. The educational
system in Papua New Guinea is divided into elementary (grades 1-3), primary (grades 48), and secondary schools (high school). There are also a small number of tertiary
institutions in the country; students must live away from home to attend these schools.
There are five elementary and two primary schools spread throughout the Mehekspeaking villages. The nearest high school is an hour’s walk north of Yiminum, the
northernmost village. Students from throughout the region board there during the week
and return home on the weekends. There are fees associated with attending school,
though these fees are nominal until the eighth grade. In fact, in the last few years, the
government has decreed that all grades eighth and below must be free. In practice,
however, there is not yet another model to support teachers and the school
infrastructure, so schools in more rural areas still must charge fees. Most children
attend school regularly for some years and then many attend only sporadically in the
upper grades. As children must often help their parents with garden work and other
household tasks, school is often less of a priority. People who do continue through the
eighth grade must pass a test to be admitted to high school, and again to continue on to
the 11th grade. High school graduates are eligible for admission to universities and48vocational schools, of which there are only a few in the country. It is the graduates of
these post-secondary schools who become teachers and nurses and often return to
their own communities.
The government’s intention with respect to education is that all elementary courses
(grades 1-3) are to be taught in the home language. This is done where possible;
however, there are not nearly enough qualified teachers in each of PNG’s 800+
languages to accomplish this goal. Community members who achieve teacher
certification typically return to their own communities to teach and so can help fulfill
this mandate. However, there are many villages and language communities for whom
this is impossible. Non-native speakers are often assigned to teach in these communities
so native language instruction is impossible. Furthermore, even when a native speaker
teacher is available, there are little to no teaching materials available. Some teachers do
sometimes take the initiative to create very basic materials, however. In the primary
grades (4-8), it is intended to transition student instruction to Tok Pisin and English. In
practice, English is not well-spoken, especially in more distant communities (including
the Mehek-speaking areas), and Tok Pisin is the sole language of instruction to the
exclusion even of Mehek. This fact, along with high parental use of Tok Pisin, are two
contributing factors to the break in transmission of Mehek from one generation to the
next. (Though there are also additional factors influencing the parents’ choice to use Tok
Pisin with their children in the first place.)492.4.4 Local Government and Representation
In the summer of 2012, there was a national election. These take place every five
years and I was privileged to observe the process firsthand as it is carried out in the
Mehek villages. There were two primary seats being voted on, a provincial and a district
representative. Due to widespread illiteracy, the system is set up to maximize
participation. Colors, photos, and numbers are used to identify races and candidates.
Each candidate was typically endorsed by a more well-known person, whose name and
photo also accompanied the candidate’s on campaign material. Campaigning often
involved a candidate’s supporters in each village encouraging them to come by building
a small grandstand. The candidate would come to make their speech and a feast would
usually be prepared. The candidate would often buy a pig to be slaughtered at the feast
or give gifts to people who promised to vote for them. This was not viewed with any
cynicism or as in any way “buying” votes; it is in keeping with the cultural practice of
reciprocal giving and mutual support.
A team of about ten election officials is assigned to each region, some of whom are
for security. Typically, the officials were natives of the region to which they were
assigned and were trained and paid for their services. There is a broad timeline for
elections, so that each village or group of villages gets a several day window in which
elections might take place. When the officials do show up, they set up a polling station
in a central area and wait for word of mouth to spread and for the populace to arrive. By
early afternoon, elections began. There is an official roll of registered voters, though
50there was some contention about the number of people registered. The village of Wilwil
had 679 registered voters, though the adult population is likely closer to 1000.
Nevertheless, there was no great tension about this.
An area of about 50 feet around (it was stated to be “100 meters”) was cordoned
off with yellow tape and four voting stalls were set up inside. They were constructed
using available materials, including a metal roofing panel, cardboard and branches cut
for the purpose on site. No campaigning or gift-giving was allowed in the area, and bush
knives were not allowed in the voting area. Voting was conducted according to the
written roll. One of the officials would call out four names and those people, if present,
would make their way into the polling stalls. As almost no one has identification, group
consensus was relied on by the officials to confirm identity, though no one tried to
impersonate another. Men were listed in alphabetical order by their father’s name;
women were listed under their husband’s name. As one or two exited, more names
would be called. Absent people would be called again at the end of the list. The entire
list took about five hours to read through one time; if needed (i.e. not enough people
voted), a second day of voting would take place, though in this instance it was not
necessary. The large majority of the village stayed in the area throughout the day; there
was a small market on site and informal discussions occurred continually.
There was an official sheet on which three choices for each office would be written
in ranked order. Candidates regularly urged people to mark their number “either one or51two.” A witness (of the voter’s choice) was allowed to accompany each voter into the
voting area to assist them if they were completely illiterate; this only happened
sporadically. After voting, the voter placed their ballot in a locked container (one of
which had an official seal, the other of which was missing its seal and had been locked
by one of the security people’s own locks), and their left pinkie nail was painted with
indelible ink. The tally of votes is done in the national capital and the results are
reported a few months later.
At the same time, local elections are also carried out, but at a much more informal
level, typically by community consensus. There are five positions decided in this way in
the villages throughout the country. They are: council member, magistrate, police
officers, and a recorder. The council member is responsible for accepting and
distributing government funds for various purposes, including health, education, and
infrastructure. The magistrate supervises the local police officers and is responsible for
reporting large crimes to higher-level government authorities and taking criminals to
jails, which are only available at the district capitals. Police officers are similar to
“neighborhood watch” members, and do not have the level of police authority typical of
Western countries. They are more akin to mediators and try to resolve disputes before
they become intractable. The magistrate and council member also serve as judges in
mid-level disputes when necessary. These disputes are those which the police cannot
resolve, but which are not criminal in nature. The recorder is responsible for keeping
written records on any matters of importance to the community.
52The people report stories of corruption at all levels of government, though it does
not seem to be endemic. The stories are typically of candidates who keep government
funds for themselves and their friends and family (though these accusations are not
always based on evidence of wrongdoing). From a Western point of view, this is
corruption. However, people with resources are expected to support their extended
families who have fewer resources and so some amount of this is tolerated as part of
the culture. Only when this happens on a large scale and community development is
substantially delayed is there outrage.","[59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69]"

With a minority of animal and plant names, the head comes second. For example,
the compound won gulma 'Won mantis', illustrated in (324) is an exception to the
general pattern whereby the head is first; in this case the second noun gulma 'mantis,
grasshopper' is the head.

plant names in which the head comes second are ones where the modifer is a
description of where the animal or plant can be found rather than simply a word for the
particular species. Example of this include aka samdo 'house spider' and wuwr gulma
'cane grass grasshopper'. In aka samdo 'house spider', the modifier is the noun for
'house' while in wuwr gulma 'cane grass grasshopper', the modifier is the name for a
type of cane grass.
In addition to these compounds, there are some species which do not have a
compound name and can only be referred to by a single noun. Due to language loss, the
less common species names are being lost by younger speakers, though older speakers
191still know them. The generic category terms are also widely used when specificity is not
called for or when the specific type was not known. For example, if a bird called out,
most speakers would know the specific name by the bird’s call and would refer to it by
its species-specific name. However, if someone was going hunting for birds, the
category name would be used, unless only one species of bird was sought.
5.11.4 Series Compounds
In addition to noun-noun compounds, groups of nouns consisting of more than two
nouns listed in series can also be a compound, as in (325) and (326).

These compounds are simply more general instances of the symmetric compounds
discussed above in that they have semantics that is more like conjunction. These series
compounds are still treated syntactically as a unit and can only host one noun phrase
clitic.
5.11.5 Hierarchical Compounds
In series compounds (mentioned in the preceding section), several nouns will be
juxtaposed and treated as a single syntactic entity. The series of nouns is a simple list (as192above)and will take dual or plural agreement as appropriate. There are also complex
compounds consisting of more than two nouns, which have a hierarchical structure in
that they can be broken down into parts, some of these parts being themselves
compounds, similar to English Boston baked beans, which consists of the noun Boston
plus the compound baked beans. With compounds consisting of three words, there are
in fact two possible constituent structures. One possibility is that the first two nouns
form a compound which together modify the final noun in the structure (NN)N. This is
illustrated in (327). In this case, mundu 'centipede' and bi 'tooth' combine in a
asymmetrical compound with bi 'tooth' as head (since mundu bi is a type of tooth), and
this compound in turn combines with siki 'hole' to form a second asymmetrical
compound with siki 'hole' as head (since the whole compound denotes a kind of hole).
(327) mundu
bi
siki=k
5062
centipede tooth hole=LOC
in the hole [made by] the centipede’s tooth.
It is also possible for the final two nouns to form a compound which together combine
with the first noun in the structure N(NN). This is illustrated by fer ama yirkwe 'pig
bamboo knife' in (328).
(328) fer kefu=r
ra-wa-m
fer ama
yirkwe mu
pig blood=M get-PAST1-3PL pig bamboo knife
3PL

general principle that the modifier occurs first and the head second. In (328), fer ama193yirkwe 'pig bamboo knife' denotes a type of bamboo knife and the compound ama
yirkwe 'bamboo knife' denotes a kind of knife.
It is also possible for the embedded compound to be a symmetrical compound. For
example, in (329), the compound afa nanda wur, literally 'father older-brother stoneaxe' but meaning 'ancestor stone-axes', the first two words afa nanda, literally 'father
older-brother' is a symmetrical compound meaning 'ancestor' that in turn modifies wur
'stone axe' in an asymmetrical compound.

nanda

[long.ago]fenda=r
from=M6097The opposite situation is also possible: one can have a complex compound where the
component parts combine together in a symmetric compound. Example (330) illustrates
this possibility, where the the component parts are suwa fringi 'leg long' and lesu fringi
'arm long' and they combine together symmetrically to denote someone with long legs
and long arms. Again, note the single noun phrase clitic at the end of the entire
sequence, showing how the entire sequence behaves like a noun.
(330) suwa fringi lesu
fringi=r

long=M
long-leg and long-arm person5084With all types of compounds, the whole compound behaves like a noun in that one
gets a single noun phrase clitic at the end of the entire sequence, as in (330). Note that
the number of the noun phrase clitic can be singular or dual or plural depending on the
194semantics of the compound. For example in (330) above, the compound is followed by a
singular clitic since although the set of long arms and long legs is plural, the compound
denotes (or can denote) a single person with long arms and long legs. Contrast this with
(331), where the compounds ari yoko 'bottom side' and kondu yoku 'top side' occur with
dual clitics because they each denote pairs of teeth.

'heart bad'9.7.3 Good Name sir nalingi
A lesser used, but still very prominent name variant is the sir nalingi. The word
nalingi by itself does not have a meaning, but it is related to the verb nali 'smile, laugh'.
This is appropriate as the sir nalingi is always used in situations of happiness and joy. An
appropriate translation of nalingi would be “good name”, as it shows it in
contradistinction to the sir kaha, in both meaning and usage. Just as is the case with the
sir kaha, the use of this form is an expression of the speaker’s attitude towards the
addressee. The form of the sir nalingi is also a unique form that is associated with a
particular given name. Any speakers with a particular given name will have the same
nalingi. There are fewer distinct forms of the nalingi than there are sir kaha forms; there
are several instances in which an entire set of given names share the same nalingi. The
nalingi is primarily used in greetings and when the addressee has said or done
something praiseworthy or pleasing to the speaker. The nalingi is not used for most dayto-day greetings, but rather when the addressee has been gone for some time.
9.7.4 Name Whistle isi
There is a whistle associated with every name, called the isi. Because the isi is still
so widely used, most forms are still well-known to most speakers. Other than very small
children, all speakers know the isi for their own name. Almost without exception, every
name has its own unique whistle, though there are a few names that do share a single394whistle call. The whistling is, in contrast to most other instances of whistle languages
reported, restricted almost entirely to the domain of names (Busnel and Classe 1996).
The speakers report that they are the only group they know of to use such whistles to
communicate, though other forms of spoken communication are common over long
distances in other areas. Many cases of whistle languages have been reported to be
restricted mainly or exclusively to the men in the community (Cowan 1948), but the isi
has no such restriction; women were observed to use it just as frequently as men and
with no reservations in doing so. A list of names and their accompanying whistles can be
found in Appendix H.
9.7.5 The Name Song hokwa
There is finally a hokwa, or name song, that is a short melody that, like the other
above-mentioned types of names, are associated with every given name. Each given
name has its own unique hokwa. This is a phenomenon which is not completely
unknown in Papua New Guinea (Niles 1992). As with the isi, however, there are a few
hokwa that are associated with more than one name. Each hokwa melody is short,
between four and 15 seconds. It will not be sung for common, day-to-day greetings, but
on special occasions and after long absences. The use of the hokwa is typically
associated with one of two taps, the mambunge fu or 'forehead tap' and the taku tongo
or 'chin slap', which are performed on the person to whom the hokwa is sung by the
singer. These are performed lightly, with about the same amount of pressure as when395applauding. The forehead tap is done with the side of the hand (with fingers extended)
in the middle of the forehead and the chin slap is performed with a grasping motion on
the underside of the chin. Each of these is usually done two to five times in quick
succession after which the other is performed. The hokwa is not used outside of the
conventionalized greeting scenario . The hokwa is the least used of the name variants
nowadays (as opposed to the isi and sir kaha) and consequently is being lost the most
quickly amongst most speakers. A list of names and their accompanying songs can be
found in Appendix H.","[409, 410, 411, 412]"

That is, these are the names that speakers will repeat in the tone of the call that the
animal makes. There are likely other names which have onomatopoeic components
which are no longer consciously known to speakers (particularly reduplicative names
that consist of words that are otherwise not found as independent morphemes). The
only non-name words that are known to have an onomatopoeic element are yo 'a sound
made while calling another' and kra 'cry'.
Sound symbolism is also not a productive system, though there a few words where
one of the vowels can vary in relationship to the size of the object being described. In
these cases, the smaller size is associated with a high vowel and the larger size is
77associated with a (relatively) lower vowel. The known examples are given in examples
(20-22).

of the grammatical system of Mehek. In §4.1, I summarize the morphology, primarily
the morphology of verbs, while in §4.2, I discuss one of the more unusual features of
Mehek, a set of noun phrase clitics that code the number and gender of noun phrases,
plus a similar set of predicate clitics which appear on nonverbal predicates.","[92, 93, 94, 95]"

"16Since the same forms occur as clitics on noun phrases, it would also be possible to analyze these

somewhat arbitrary.",[363]
"673.7 Phonotactics
This section lists all the possible consonant sequences in mono-morphemic forms.
Sequences of different vowels do not occur, i.e. two vowels will only occur together in a
mono-morphemic form if they are the same. As mentioned in §3.3.1, the two vowels
will often be separated by an epenthetic [h]. Therefore, this section deals only with the
possible combinations of consonants in syllable onsets and codas. Consonant clusters
are never separated by an epenthetic element.
3.7.1 Onset Combinations
The following Table 12 lists the possible onset consonant clusters. The horizontal
row lists the first member of the cluster, and the vertical column gives the second
member. An onset cluster can consist of two or three consonants, with the restrictions
given in the table. For onsets with only a single consonant, any phoneme can occur./b/

-Table 12: Onset Consonant Clusters
There is, in addition to these clusters, a single word which in some dialects of Kafle
is pronounced as /stii/. The word in most other dialects is simply tii 'remove'. This is the68only known example of a word that begins with a cluster including /s/. The first person
singular possessive form /n+go/ (see §5.4.4, note 3) also has an underlying initial cluster.
In this case, the cluster is created through a morphological process of prefixing the 1SG
form n to the possessive stem go. However, this is realized phonetically simply as the
normal prenasalized (see §3.4.1) velar consonant, /ŋgo/, rather than as a sequence of
two consonants.
3.7.2 Coda Combinations

Codas are limited to two consonants, and only certain consonants can occur in
either position. Only those that can be in a cluster are given in the table. The horizontal
row lists the first member of the cluster, and the vertical column gives the second
member. Coda clusters are almost exclusively the result of morphological processes, so69after each consonant in the first horizontal row, its morphological meaning is given in
parenthesis. The glosses listed are only the primary lexical meaning without taking the
suffix into account. Codas with only a single consonant can consist of any phoneme
except the voiced stops /b/, /d/, and /g/. In addition to the table below, there is a firstperson singular imperative verbal morpheme ('I will do X now') which itself is a
consonant cluster, /tn/ (see §6.5). This is shown in example (7).

When two vowels occur in sequence, they will either create a diphthong or will
coalesce. In the case of coalescence, one vowel in a sequence of two is either reduced
or not pronounced at all. Diphthongs occur when a pair of vowels occur within a word
(see §3.2.1); a sequence of two different vowels within a word always results in a
diphthong. When two vowels occur across a word boundary, there will often be
coalescence. The general rule is that the second vowel will be realized, while the first
vowel will not be pronounced. That is, when a word that ends in a vowel is followed by a
word that begins in a vowel, the word-final vowel is not pronounced in favor of the
word-initial vowel. There are three exceptions to this generalization. These are: 1) when
two identical vowels occur across word boundaries they are both pronounced fully, in
the same manner as when they occur within a word; 2) words ending in /i/ do not
participate in coalescence – both vowels are pronounced with an intervening glottal
70stop; 3) word-final /u/ is not eliminated, but rather reduced to /w/. (See §3.3.2 for more
information about exceptions 1 and 2.) Table 14 gives examples of each of the nonidentical two-vowel pairs in both phonemic and phonetic forms, along with a brief gloss.

'REAL sugar'*Table 14: Vowel Coalescence713.8 Stress
Most words consist of one or two syllables, the great majority of syllables being V,
VC or CV. Some words are tri-syllabic, though this is uncommon. Words longer than
three syllables only exist as compound nouns or verbs. Stress is indicated by a higher
impressionistic intensity on the stressed vowel. Unstressed vowels are not reduced in
any way; they are just not pronounced as prominently as the stressed syllable. Stress in
single words almost always falls on the penultimate syllable; there are a few exceptions
as detailed in §3.3.1 and §3.3.2. There is also a tendency for words where the final
syllable contains a complex coda (i.e. two consonants) to have the primary stress.
Examples (8) to (10) have penultimate stress, while (11), with a complex coda, has final
stress.

'he cut'Stress placement in two-word compounds varies based on the semantics of the
compound. In some two-word compounds with a total of four or more syllables
between the two words, the primary stress can be on the antepenultimate. Otherwise,
in these compounds, the stress will fall in its natural position on each member of the
compound, with the stress on the second member of the compound being a weaker,
secondary stress. In noun-adjective compounds (see §5.6), the second element (the72adjective) has primary stress and the preceding noun has weaker stress. In noun-noun
compounds (see §5.11), each element has its own full stress, as it would if it were alone.
Examples (12) and (13) demonstrate these different stress patterns.

'yam basket'Stress can sometimes shift from the penultimate to the ultimate syllable in lists or
when calling someone. This latter example is typically heard with kin terms, such as
nawa 'mother' ata 'grandmother', etc. Also, the presence of affixes does not affect
stress placement; the stressed syllable prior to affixation in verbs, for example (see
Chapter 6) retains the stress after tense and person/number/gender marking is added.","[83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89]"
