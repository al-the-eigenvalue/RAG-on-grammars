"NEGsigive.birth14.2.1.2. Bias in yes/no questions
Quite often, perhaps usually, a speaker expects one response rather than the
other to a yes/no question. Sometimes this bias does not seem to overtly affect the form of the question. Thus la and bi questions are apparently neutral
in form, although in context either an affirmative or a negative answer may
be anticipated. Ti and tähä questions, on the other hand, are always heavily
biased. It is not possible to say exactly what the bias is from the form of the
question. Both positive and negative questions may have both positive and
negative bias. All that the use of tiltähä seems to contribute is the information that bias is present. Positive bias (i.e. expectation of a 'yes' answer, indicating the hearer believes in the truth of the positive proposition, or the
truth of the positive proposition corresponding to the negative one) is more
common than negative bias. All four examples of tiltähä questions in the
previous section (23) and (25) have positive bias. However, both positive
and negative questions can also have negative bias, as the following examples show:

"14.2. Questions
14.2.1. Yes/no527questionsYes/no questions are those which solicit a comment on the truth of the questioned proposition (cf. Sadock and Zwicky 1985: 179). The question is not
always ""open"", however, since the speaker typically expects one answer
more than the other (Givön 1990, chapter 18). Nor is the question equally
about all the information in the proposition. Instead the scope of the interrogation typically falls on what would be the focus of assertion in the corresponding declarative. These issues are dealt with in separate subsections of
the present section, after an initial description of the form of yes/no questions. A fourth section describes the alternative question subtype.","[549, 550]"

14.2.1.4. Alternative questions
Alternative questions, which invite the addressee to choose one member of a
disjunction, are formed by means of the ""disjunction"" läa 'or', and have no
specifically interrogative morphology. Following are some examples. The
first presents a disjunction of declaratives, the second a disjunction of subjunctives (hortatives):
(34) a. Ciß-jytebft

we.NONDECL SUBJUNC her throw vultures.DEF to
should we throw her to the vultures?'
The conjunction läa is probably the etymological source of the yes/no interrogative particle la. Yes/no questions were evidently originally truncated
alternative questions with the second disjunct missing.
14.2.2. Constituent questions
Constituent (""information"", ""wh"") questions are different from yes/no questions in both form and function. Speakers typically use constituent questions
when they wish to know one bit of information which is missing in an oth-14.2. Questions533erwise known proposition (cf. Giv<Sn 1990, chapter 18). The bit of desired
information is coded with a question word, for which there is no equivalent
in a yes/no question.
The basic structure of constituent questions is described in the following
subsection. Subsequent sections give specific information about the various
types of question, classified according to the question word employed.","[554, 555, 556]"
"14.2. Questions
Questions in Supyire, like those in most languages (cf. Sadock and Zwicky
1985: 178), can be broadly classified into two major types: yes/no questions
and constituent questions (Sadock and Zwicky call them ""information"" questions). The two types are distinguished in Supyire by the different interrogative particles they require, and by the presence of question words in constituent questions versus their absence in yes/no questions. These two major
types of question are dealt with in the first two principal subsections of this
section.
In addition to the major question types, there are a couple of minor types.
Alternative questions (see section 14.2.1.4) are similar to yes/no questions,
and are historically related to them. The 'What about ...' question type (see
section 14.2.4) is more like a constituent question in function, but lacks a
question word. Two further subsections deal with subjects related to questions: complex questions (section 14.2.3), and non-interrogative uses of
questions (section 14.2.5).",[549]
"NEGIn contrast to negative tä! tähä questions, negative mä/ä questions are routinely biased to a positive response. The two examples in (24) in the previous section both expect consent to the truth of the corresponding affirmative
declarative. This is the most common pattern with negative yes/no questions
cross-linguistically (see Givön 1990, chapter 18).",[553]
"11.5. Verbs of speech and cognition453Yib6 allows and indeed seems to favor complements in the direct quotation
style. Following are examples of yes/no, alternative, and constituent questions directly quoted. Note that the dative-addressee is coded as the direct
object, and that it is obligatorily mentioned.

Just as with declarative /»-complements, most indirect question complements are in every respect (apart from intonation) like independent questions
except that they are reworked to reflect the deictic center of the main clause.
The following examples illustrate indirect alternative and constituent questions:454Chapter 11: Complement clauses(69) a. indirect alternative question

Indirect yes/no questions are interesting in that, at least for some speakers,
they preserve the older, alternative form of the question marker (läa ' o r ' ) instead of using the shortened form employed in direct yes/no questions (/a).
(70) Kä uru

m)) yäha mobilige
e läa.
me leave truck.DEF in or
take (lit. leave) me in the truck.'
There is one further type of complement which might be described as an
indirect question, though it takes a conditional rather than interrogative form.
In this connection note that in English indirect yes/no questions can be cast
in conditional form, as the gloss in the above example shows. In Supyire, the
use of a conditional complement indicates a subjective uncertainty or wondering, whereas the use of the question form indicates that a question was
actually posed. Thus conditional complements are used with yib6/yig6 only
when the main clause is reflexive. 'She asked herself...' is the Supyire way11.5. Verbs of speech and cognition455of saying ""she wondered...'. For most speakers the conditional complement
must be in a form with an initial conditional marker ämpyi or kämpyi (for
the formation of conditionals, and the etymology of this marker, see chapter
15, section 15.1.5.1). Following is an example:
(71)U a
ύ-γέ '
yib6 ämpyi Pyäerd si
m-pä.
she PERF she-REFL ask if
Pierre FUT FP-come
'She wondered if Pierre would come.'","[475, 476, 477, 478]"
"DisjunctionIn comparison with contrast, coordinate clauses with the relation of disjunction ('or') are only infrequently used in the corpus. There are two distinct
ways of coding disjunction, neither of which has a very general use. The
first was mentioned in chapter 14, in the section on alternative questions
(14.2.1.4). It was pointed out there that when it is used to conjoin clauses,
the ""disjunction"" läa 'or' normally creates a question (moreover läa is the
probable source of the yes/no question marker la), though in its use as a
noun phrase conjunction this is not true (see chapter 6, section 6.7.2). Following are examples of this type of alternative question:
(111)a. U a
kärd läa u
na
ßye bag6
e?
she PERF go
or she PROG be house.DEF in
'Has she gone or is she in the house?'
b. Mu gii

'Are you going to work
läa mu gii
rä a
bärä
yuü?
or you POT go PROG conversation take.IMPFV
or are you going to talk?'",[619]
"The etymology of mi is uncertain, but it is possibly related to the locative
adverb m i ' o v e r there'. It is identical in form with the clause final marker
for a type of comparative clause initiated with the conjunction bk and terminated by m i ( s e e chapter 15, section IS.1.4). This seems to point to an origin
as some sort of reinforcer.
Mi combines with the clause final politeness marker yö (see chapter 5,
section 5.10) to yield m6 (sometimes pronounced [mbö]):
(150)Yi fly ε ä
fly
aha
a
törö
they NEG PERF be.much SC pass
'They weren't very many.'md.
NEG.POLThe other major clause final negative marker, mä, is used principally in
questions. The initial [m] frequently elides if the metrical conditions are
right, but this is not obligatory. For yes/no questions, the ordinary question
marker la is simply replaced by mä, and the result is a negative yes/no question. Such negative questions are almost always rhetorical in force, and are
strongly biased towards a positive response, just as negative questions are in
English:
(151)a. Mu fly ε ä
ma
shyiri-foö
jiyi mä?
you NEG PERF your witness-owner see NEG.Q
'Didn't you see your buddy?'",[400]
"14.2.1.3. Focus in yes/no questions
Normally only the information that would be in the focus of assertion in the
corresponding declarative falls under the scope of interrogation in a yes/no
question. This is parallel to the way that negation is attracted to the scope of
assertion, and seems to be a general characteristic of yes/no questions in all
languages (cf. Giv6n 1990, chapter 18). Thus adverbs and adverbial phrases
attract the scope of interrogation, leaving the rest of the clause presupposed
as true. In the following example, there is no question that the addressee has
come. Only the means of arrival is in doubt:
(28)Mu äpanigisügina la?you PERF come bicycle.DEF on Q
'Did you come on bicycle?'
Similarly, quantifiers, even in the subject noun phrase, also attract the scope
of interrogation. In the following example, it is taken for granted that some
of them have arrived. The question therefore falls on the quantifier in particular.
(29)Piρυηάäpala?they all
PERF come Q
'Have they all come?'
It was pointed out in section 12.1 of chapter 12 that information in contrastive focus automatically attracts the focus of assertion. It also consequently
attracts the scope of interrogation. Cleft focus constructions are quite common in yes/no questions. The only part of the proposition which is in the
scope of interrogation is the focused phrase at the head of the sentence.
Following are examples of both positive and negative cleft constructions in
yes/no questions:14.2. Questions531(30) positive clefts:
a. Μ)) 11 si
ή-kwü la?
I
she FUT FP-die Q
'Is it I who will die?'
b. Tähä ρire

(31) negative clefts:

'Isn't it you who are the chief of the earth 9 here?'
b. Tähä mii cobmji
bä
Q
my younger.sibling.DEF it.is.not
'Wasn't it my younger brother
u a
ύ kän
he PERF it give
who gave it?'me?
NEGJust as in declarative clefts, the information in the clause following the focused item is presupposed.
Questions are not necessarily complete clauses. Quite often shared information is simply left unuttered by a speaker, and the yes/no question particle
is appended to the noun or adpositional phrase which is the focus of interrogation. For example, in the following questions, the clause 'Are you a ...',
must be recovered from the context of use:
(32) a. Nämpontjo bä?
guest
Q
'(Are you) a stranger?'
b. Lüüzü la?
hunter Q
'(Are you) a hunter?'
Similarly, occasionaly a speaker will request confirmation of one bit of information that he or she didn't hear properly, or simply can't believe:
(33) a. Kücwuun lä?
monkey
Q
'(Did I hear you say) a monkey?'","[553, 554]"
"528Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech actsThe clause final marker bi can be used in constituent questions, but when
it is appended to a clause without any question word, it forms a simple
yes/no question, just like la:
(22)Teenzanga mit ßye sig6
c bi?
Teenzanga also be bush.DEF in Q
'Is Teenzanga also in the bush (i.e. at work in the field)?'","[550, 551]"
"735positive counterpart ('Monkey is well') rather than the confirmation of
the negative. Note that the English translation 'Isn't Monkey well?' is
biased towards a positive response, whereas the translation used in the
example is not as obviously so biased. There is nothing in the form of
the Supyire corresponding to this difference in English.
In the Supyire culture, the 'chiefs of the earth' are different from chiefs
of villages. The former have a certain spiritual jurisdiction over the
land, but do not actually dispose of it, nor do they have any jurisdiction
over people.
Recall that bi without a question word forms a yes/no question (see
section 14.2.1.1 above).
The reference is to undoing a curse on the land due to a taboo being
broken.
L f r / ' h o u r , time' is borrowed from French l'heure 'the hour'.
Wyere literally means 'leaves'. See chapter 12, note 4.
There are of course sometimes ways of rephrasing the sentence to exclude the use of a serial construction. With the present example the adpositional marking of instrument case role can be used instead of the serial verb marking, and then the direct object of the main verb can be
questioned without difficulty:
flähä u
a
kwbn πά
gwooni
)
ye?
what s/hePERFcut
with knife.DEF withQ
'What did s/he cut with the knife?'",[758]
"Negative constituent questions are marked with the same negative interrogative clause final marker (/ni/i) as negative yes/no questions. However,
instead of replacing the positive marker, as in yes/no questions, the negative
marker is placed in front of the other interrogative particle. The set of nonparticipants in a specific event is of course infinite. This means that the
pragmatic situations in which a speaker would want information on the
identity of a specific non-participant are rather rare. It is often of practical
use to know why an event did not take place, however, and so negative reason questions like the following are not uncommon:
(41) a. ßähä ηά mu pye
ά

mä

'Why didn't you come yesterday?'ye?
Q536Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts
b. ßähä ηά mä
what on NEG.Q
'Why not?'ye?
Q14.2.2.2.jö 'who, whom, whose'
Jö (or jö) is borrowed from Bambara jon 'who'. It is sometimes combined
with the Supyire root foo 'owner, person in charge' (see chapter 3, section
3.2.2.9), which takes a low tone in this context: jöfbö. The use of jö or jöfbd
indicates that the speaker believes the referent he or she is asking the identity of is a human being. Jö is accordingly treated as being gender 1 singular
for the purposes of agreement. Thus when it is the subject which is questioned, a gender 1 singular place-holding pronoun must immediately follow
the question word:
(42) Jd

who he PAST PROG FUT FP-sit
'Who would have succeeded
ΒAm be me k66ge
na ye?
Babemba inheritance.DEF on Q
Babemba (lit. sat on Babemba's inheritance)?'
Jd, like all other pronouns in Supyire, is not marked for case in any way:
the same form is used for subject, direct object, indirect object, and genitive:
(43) a. subject, indirect object
Jö
u
a

c. genitive

'Whose wife is that?'","[558, 559]"
"14.2.1.1. Basic structure of yes/no questions
The basic structure of yes/no questions is that of a declarative sentence with
the addition of one of a number of interrogative markers. Most of these are
sentence final, but one is sentence initial.
The most common of the yes/no interrogative markers is la: 7
(19)a. Usirii-päla?she FUT FP-come Q
'Will she come?'
b. Cinkugolaagäάtoonnähänä la?",[550]
"14.2. Questions535Not all constituent questions are cast in cleft form. A small minority of examples in the corpus have their question word in the place it would take in a
declarative sentence. This may be partly a result of influence from Bambara,
which does not place focused items or question words at the beginning of the
clause. It may also be due to some as yet undetected pragmatic factor(s).
Following is an example of a questioned direct object left in its normal position:
(38) Ml) f
sä ßähi jw6 kwüu
kanha na bi?
I
SUBJUNC go what say dead(GlP) village at Q
'What must I go say in the village of the dead?'
Supyire also allows ""double"" questions, in which two constituents rather
than just one are questioned. In such questions, only one of the questioned
words is fronted, and the other is left in its ordinary place:
(39) Jö
υ
si
rä pähä pyi an/
ye?
who s/he FUT go what do there Q
'Who will go do what there?'
Just as with yes/no questions, speakers sometimes simply leave obvious,
presupposed information unuttered. Thus minimal questions can be formed
consisting solely of the question word plus the interrogative marker:
(40) a. Jd ye?
who Q
'Who?'
c. D) ye?
how Q
'How?'b. ßähä ye?
what Q
'What?'
d. JüM)
ye?
how.much Q
'How much?'","[557, 558]"
"14.2. Questions529The other way to form negative yes/no questions is simply by adding the
clause initial interrogative particle ti or tähä to a negative clause marked by
mi as in declaratives:
(25)a.","[551, 552]"
"Cenkungo distance.DEF PERF be.long here at Q
'Is Cenkungo far from here?'
Occasionally one hears the particle wä, borrowed from Bambara, where it
is the most common yes/no question marker:
(20) Pi na
ma
wä?
they PROG come.IMPFV Q
'Are they coming?'
Another particle, #έοτ kS, is probably also borrowed from Bambara ki, although there it apparently does not have an interrogative function, but means
rather 'of course' or 'for sure'. It can have this meaning in Supyire as well,
but at least for some speakers it has acquired the additional meaning of
marking a yes/no question. These speakers insist that it has the same function as la. Following is an example:
(21)Mu sim-pänümpangak£?you FUT FP-come tomorrow Q
'Are you coming tomorrow?'",[550]
"There are two clause initial yes/no question particles which are probably
etymologically related. The form tähä is the most common. The variant tone
tune tähä also occurs, and at least one instance of jähä has been recorded.
The other form, tä, is perhaps simply a shorter form of the same particle.
The variant kä has, however, been recorded in the speech of an old man
from Fanter61a. Following are examples of these two particles:
(23) a. Tähä mu

Negative yes/no questions can be formed in two ways. One is by means of
the clause final negative question marker mä, frequently reduced to a. Negative marking in the auxiliary position is added exactly as in a declarative:

"14.2.4. ' What about...?' questions
There is a type of question in Supyire which solicits more information than
merely a comment on the truth of the proposition as in a yes/no question, but
does not ask for the hearer to identify a particular referent as in constituent
questions. The speaker rather asks a generalized question 'What about...? 1 ,
and the specific information desired is usually obvious from the context. The
question is marked with the final interrogative particle
which in the examples below will be glossed 'what about* in order to distinguish it from the
interrogative particles discussed in previous sections.
There are two subtypes of 'what about1 questions. The first type consists
simply of a noun phrase with the interrogative particle appended. The addressee must infer from the speech context what information about the referent of the noun phrase the speaker is seeking. In the following example, a
master poses the question to his slave, who had previously been ordered to
fill the master's snuff box. The question therefore means something like
'What have you done with my snuffbox? 1 :(68) Mii batärjidt?my snuff.box.DEF what.about
'What about my snuffbox?'
Similarly, the following example was uttered in the context of a discussion
of who would be going to market that day. The question therefore means
something like 'Are you going too? 1 :
(69)Mu d6?
you what.about
'How about you?'",[568]
"The antecedent is not necessarily overtly expressed, but may be implied.
For example, in reply to the question ""What time is it?"" a possible answer might be:
Katreri-rjisän-ηϊßyefour.o'clock-DEFGIS OTHER-DEFG1S be
'It's ten till four.'minutf-iki.minute-GlP tenLiterally, 'the remainder of four o'clock is ten minutes'.",[734]
"It should be noted that the type of yes/no question formed with a clause initial marker tä(hä) /tähä does not take mä in the negative, but rather mir.

D) is used in one other frozen expression which is rather odd from a synchronic point of view. A question consisting solely of d) preceded by the
yes/no interrogative particle tähä and followed by the clause final interrogative marker ye means something like 'Isn't that so?' or 'Isn't that right?':
(51)Tähä d)ye?","[561, 562]"
"14.2.2.1. Basic structure of constituent questions
Constituent questions are doubly marked in Supyire. They contain question
words, which have no non-interrogative function (unlike the corresponding
words in languages like English or French, in which many of the question
words also function as relative pronouns), and they are marked with sentence
final interrogative particles. Three such markers are used. Most of the question words are accompanied by the particle ye. Some speakers also occasionally use bi for these question types.10 Locative questions take the final
marker k6 (usually voiced to g€).
There are five simple question words in Kampwo Supyire, in addition to
the interrogative determiners, for which there are both ordinary and emphatic forms for each of the genders. Table 41 lists these question words.
Only the gender 1 singular interrogative determiners are included; for the
forms of the determiners in other genders see Tables 18 and 19 in chapter S.
'When' and 'why' are missing from the table because they are not simple
question words (see section 14.2.2.3 for 'why' and 14.2.2.6 for 'when').",[556]

k<<The majority of constituent questions in Supyire are in the form of cleft focus constructions. The question word, or the noun phrase containing it, is
fronted to focus position at the head of the clause. The same case recoverability strategies are used as in clefts: a resumptive pronoun for subjects, a
gap for direct objects, and adpositional marking of the focused item for indi-534Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech actsrect objects (see chapter 12, section 12.1.1). The information which the
speaker and hearer share is placed in the presupposed clause following the
focused item. Following are examples illustrating a questioned subject (35a),
direct object (35b), and indirect objects (35c, d):

QThe focused noun phrase containing the question word is not always
moved to the absolute beginning of the sentence. It may be preceded by a
phrase in topic position, from which it is typically separated by a pause. The
topic usually delimits a domain within which the desired information is to be
sought. Thus in the following example, taken from a riddle-like story, the answer to the question is to be chosen from the list in topic position:
(36) Ρ ire
näfljiibii
shüünnirji
these(EMPH) young.men.DEF two.DEF
'(Of) these two young men
nä pi
tiirji
nä pi

and their father and their mother,
jö
u jiye pi
puni shin-fabagi
ye?
who s/he be their all
person-be.weak.DEF Q
who is the weakest (lit. who is their weakest person)?'
It is also possible to place time or locative phrases in topic position in a
cleft-style question:
(37)U ta-siige
e, flähä mu ä
pyi ye?
its LOC-begin.DEF in what you PERF do Q
'At its ( = the feast's) beginning, what did you do?'","[556, 557]"
"Although the etymology of mä is not known, internal evidence shows that
it has been shortened in clause final position. When it appears in negative
constituent questions, it is no longer final, but is placed before the interrogative marker ye. In this position its vowel is usually long:
(153) Jlähä πά mu si
zhyi
nigisüiji
na
what on you FUT FP.go bicycle.DEF on
'Why don't you go on bicycle?'mää
NEG.Qye?
QIf the [m] elides, however, the vowel is short:
(154) ßähä kaa
ύ
tä u sähä
wä
ta ä
what it PERF him get he NEG.YET IND get SC
'What has prevented (lit. gotten) him (so that) he has not yet
managed to
yaha u-yd
tännä a
ye?
leave he-REFL beside NEG.Q Q
save any (lit. leave some beside himself)?'
It should be pointed out that negative constituent questions appear to be
rather rarely used: the two just cited are the only unelicited ones occurring
in the corpus. By contrast, negative yes/no questions are relatively common:
nearly 150 unelicited examples appear in the corpus.
Although mä used alone seems to currently carry interrogative meaning, it
is evident that it originally did not do so: when it occurs with the exclamative marker de, there is no trace of interrogative function. Rather, the combination serves as an emphatic negator. In the great majority of cases, the [m]
of mä is elided:9.4. Negation

"Musa PERF know if
Jean PERF come
'Musa knows if Jean has come.'
This construction can only be used with second and third person subjects,
since speakers presumably know what they know.
Like yib6, ce can take indirect constituent question complements as well:
(76)U acdjdυsim-päye.he PERF know who s/he FUT FP-come Q
'He knows who will come.'
Some speakers (significantly they seem to be younger ones) use the conditional subordinator ämpyi/kämpyi even with constituent question complements, as if it were an all-purpose complementizer for indirect question
complements (note in the following example that the question marker ye is
dropped before the negative marker at the end of the sentence):
(77)Cedgipyeacdwoman.DEF NEG PERF know
'The woman doesn't know
ampyijdusiürütegime.if
who s/he FUT her(EMPH) help
who will help her.'",[479]
"11.5.3. QuestioncomplementsA few verbs of speech and cognition can take /^complements in the form of
questions. The most common of these is the verb yi1)6 'ask', which has a
variant pronunciation yig6. The full range of possibilities occurs with this
verb in the corpus, and so it will provide a useful means to illustrate the
various complement types. Other verbs will be briefly described at the end
of the section.",[475]
"186Chapter 5: Other word classes5.9. Question words
In section 5.1.2.9 above the forms of the interrogative pronoun/determiners
which are integrated into the noun gender system were given. Table 28 gives
the other common question words used in the formation of constituent questions. As can be seen, half of them are borrowed from Bambara.","[208, 209]"

"14.2.5. The non-interrogative use of questions
As in many languages, questions can sometimes be put to non-interrogative
use in Kampwo Supyire.15 There are many such uses, but only one will be
illustrated here: the cross-linguistically common practice of using rhetorical
questions to introduce a new thematic section. This device is apparently confined to procedural and expository discourse in Supyire. The following rhetorical questions are all taken from one discourse explaining Supyire burial
customs. Each question begins a new thematic paragraph dealing with the
topic raised by the question:
(73) a. Sänyi

ä jwo ye?
SC say Q
'How is this money distributed?'","[570, 571]"
"14.2.3. Complex questions
The restrictions on the questioning of items in subordinate or coordinate
clauses is a large topic which needs to be further explored. Only a few observations will be made here, first on questions with serial verb constructions, and then on questions with complement clauses. Many of the examples
in this section were elicited rather than culled from texts, and several of
them are manifestly unusual from a pragmatic point of view. The generalizations drawn therefore should only be considered as tentative.
Questioning of the subject in a sentence with serial verbs presents no difficulty, since all the verbs must share a common subject. The usual method,
with a resumptive pronoun, is used:
(59) Jlähä ku si
fi-jä
vwdro
j)g6 mobiligi i
ye?
what it FUT FP-be.ableFP-go.out this car.DEF from Q
'What will be able to get out ofthat car?'
There are restrictions on the questioning of direct objects, however. If only
one of the verbs in the serial construction is transitive, there is no problem,
and the object of either the initial (60a) or the final verb (60b) can be questioned without difficulty:
(60) a. Jlähä u a
lwb a kärd pyenga ye?
what s/he PERF take SC go
home Q
'What did s/he take (lit. take and go) home?'
b. Jla/iä mu a
teen na
wii
ύ ' tään ye?
what you PERF sit
PROG look.at her beside Q
'What are you sitting and looking at beside her?'
If both verbs are transitive, the direct object of the first (61a) can be questioned in the ordinary way (i.e. by means of placing the question word in focus position), but this is not possible with the direct object of the second
verb (61b):
(61) a. Jlähä u a
täha ä kyaäre
kwbn ye?
what s/he PERF use SC meat.DEF cut Q
'What did s/he use to cut the meat?'",[565]

Tähä kücwuunßyeacitügdQ

'Is monkey not well?' 8mi?","[552, 553]"
"12.1. Focus constructions
In Supyire, as in many languages, it is possible to distinguish two major
types of focus, which we will label ""weak"" and ""strong"" focus (cf. de Vries
1985). These labels are far from satisfactory, but in view of the terminological confusion in this area, it is best to avoid more specific terms which
might be misleading. If fact what we are here calling ""weak"" focus is often
termed the ""focus of assertion"". It is that part of a proposition which attracts the scope of negation (see chapter 9, section 9.4.2) and, in the corresponding yes/no question, it also attracts the scope of interrogation (see
chapter 14, section 14.2.1.3). Quantifiers and adjectives also typically fall
under the scope of weak focus (see chapter 6, sections 6.3.3 and 6.4). In a
declarative sentence, the information which falls under the scope of weak
focus is frequently, but not necessarily, new. It is typically asserted against
the background of the hearer's presumed ignorance.
In this section we will examine the most common devices used in Supyire
to encode strong focus. Strong focus is used in a number of pragmatic situations in which the speaker desires to draw particular attention to one noun
phrase (or to an adverb). It includes, for example, what is often called
""contrastive"" focus, when the speaker wishes to indicate one out of two or
more possibilities. It is also covers situations when a speaker has good reason to believe that the hearer might possibly be mistaken, or is in danger of
being mistaken, and wishes to set him or her right. Finally, it includes what468Chapter 12: Focus and topic constructionsmight be called ""strong focus of assertion"", such as focus in replies to constituent questions, and focus on new, major participants at the beginning of a
narrative (for this last, see section 12.2.1 below).","[490, 491]"
"QIt can also be left in the position it would occupy if not focused, however:540
(53)Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts
U ä
bayi
juuli
ftenra
he PERF houses how.many build
'How many houses has he built?*ye?
Q14.2.2.6. Interrogative determiners
There are two sets of interrogative determiners (for the forms see chapter 5,
section 5.1.2.9 and 5.1.2.10). One appears to be derived from the other by
the addition of the same -re suffix which derives emphatic pronouns from
ordinary anaphoric ones (e.g. u > uru). In the current usage of Kamp wo
Supyire there seems to be little difference in function between the two sets.
The emphatic forms are more common, but the frequency of occurrence in
the corpus of texts is so low (2 ordinary, 9 emphatic) that nothing sensible
can be said about how they might differ in discourse function.
Like all determiners, the interrogatives agree with the head noun in number and gender. Although the meaning is the same as that obtained with jiähä
as a determiner (see section 14.2.2.3 above), the interrogative determiners
require a head noun in definite form rather than indefinite (in this they resemble the indefinite determiners (see chapter 6, section 6.1.2.1). The questioned noun phrase is most often placed in initial focus position:
(54) a. Klni
hdi
) u pya ye?

'Which country is he in?'
b. Lerirji12
f)g)r6
u
hour.DEF(GlS) which(EMPH.GlS) it(GlS)
'Which hour is therewä
be.theremu ά ye?
you to Q
to you?' i.e. What time have you got?
As with other determiners, the head can be a pronoun:
(55) a. U
$gl
mil si
ή-kän
ye?
it(G 1S) which(G 1S) I
FUT FP-give Q
'Which one shall I give?'
b. Ku
j)klr6
nä mu jiye na
p-cää
ye?
it(G2S) which(EMPH.G2S) on you be PROG IP-want Q
'Which one do you want?'
In Kampwo Supyire the determiners are also used as pronouns, and the interrogatives are no exception to this generalization. The following example14.2. Questions541illustrates this, as well as the fact that, like the other question words, initial
position is not obligatory for the interrogative determiner-pronouns:
(56)Sänyimäha säjw6death.announcement.DEF HAB go say
'The announcements of the death are made (lit. said)
mpiräάye?which(EMPH.GlP) to Q
to which ones?'
The most common way of questioning the time of some occurrence
('when 1 ) is by means of the noun tdni 'the time* together with an interrogative determiner and the postposition ier.
(57)Tdnihdir6e mu kpaye?time.DEF which(EMPH) in you PERF come Q
'When did you come?'
One also occasionally hears the phrasepähä tdrd 'what time' for 'when 1 .14.2.2.7. taä 'where'
The locative question word taä is obviously related to the locative nominalizing prefix ta- (see chapter 3, section 3.2.2.3). Both are undoubtedly derived
from a noun meaning 'place', which although it has not survived in Kampwo
Supyire, does occur in other Senufo languages (cf. Cebaara te?i 'place'). At
least one speaker has been recorded using the pronunciation tahä ([ta?ä]).
Nouns derived by the prefix ta- are in gender 2, the singular suffix for which
is -gV (definite -ke or -ge). It is therefore rather interesting that questions
formed with taä do not take the common clause final question marker ye, but
rather have an exclusively locative clause final question marker k6 (often
g6). It is probably not accidental that this same clause final marker is the
relative clause marker (see chapter 13, section 13.1).
In all but one of the examples of locative questions occurring in the corpus, the question word is placed in focus position:
(58)a. Taämakeegtke?where you.NONDECL go.IMPFV LOC.Q
'Where are you going?'
b. TaäBüwärääyiriηάtirewhere Buwara PERFget.up with this(EMPH)

"QOnly a question in which the question word is not placed in focus position is
possible for the direct object of the second of two transitive verbs: 14
(62)Uärjwoonitähaaßähikw5ns/he PERF knife.DEF use SC what cut

"14.1. Manipulative speech acts517Chapter 14
Non-declarative speech acts
Most if not all languages distinguish three major sentence types: declarative,
imperative, and interrogative (Sadock and Zwicky 1985). Supyire, in common with all the Senufo languages, conforms to this generalization. The bulk
of this grammar is devoted to declaratives, in conformity with descriptive
tradition. This tradition is probably due to the twin factors of the greater
text-frequency of declaratives and to the greater degree of syntactic elaboration usually found in declaratives (Givön 1990, chapter 18). This chapter in
contrast is devoted entirely to the description of the other two sentence
types.
The three major sentence types can be conceived of as grammaticalized
means of performing three major functions of language: to convey information (declarative), to give orders, requests, invitations or the like
(imperative), and to elicit information (interrogative). In Supyire, as in many
languages, imperatives are principally distinguished by what they lack
(subject, auxiliary) in comparison to other clause types. There is also one
auxiliary used exclusively in a subtype of imperative. Also dealt with in this
chapter is the use of the subjunctive to accomplish a politer manipulation
than the ""bare"" imperative.
Questions in Kampwo Supyire are a more marked sentence type than either
imperatives or declaratives. All questions have some sort of interrogative
particle at the end or, in a few cases, at the beginning of the sentence. In addition, in constituent (""wh"") questions, the use of question words and, in the
majority of questions, the use of the cleft focus construction also mark the
clause as different.
A further characteristic distinguishing both imperatives and interrogatives
from declaratives is the use of the non-declarative set of first and second
person pronouns (for the form of these pronouns see chapter 5, section
5.1.1.2). These special pronouns are not obligatory in imperatives and questions, and in fact, ordinary first and second person pronouns are even more
common in these sentence types. Further, the first person singular non-declarative pronoun na cannot be used as subject. On the other hand, the nondeclarative pronouns cannot be used in declarative sentences, except in three
functions: as reflexive genitive possessors (see chapter 6, section 6.2.1), as
genitive possessors in vocatives (first person only), and in exclamations. Examples of the latter two functions are:518Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts(1) a. vocative, genitive possessor
Na
cevoo mpi, m)i
canmpyi-tanra-wüύηί
my.NONDECL friend hare my day-third-POSS.DEF
'My friend Hare, this is my third day
Ii nde m)i sähä

it this I
NEG.YET toad

that I haven't yet gotten a toad to eat.'
b. exclamation, genitive possessor
IJkää ma
bwula a
tään!
but your.NONDECL gourd PERF be.sweet
'But your fruit is delicious!1
c. exclamation, indirect object
Νύ fblä
ä
cü
nä
näf
cow owner PERF grab me.NONDECLon
'The owner of the cow has caught me!'
The vocative can perhaps be distinguished as a minor speech act (getting
the addressee's attention, or acknowledging or establishing a specific level
of politeness or familiarity/formality with the addressee) which is different
from the declarative speech act of conveying information. Exclamations,
when they are complete clauses, are usually syntactically like declaratives in
Kampwo Supyire (there are no 'interrogative' type exclamations like English
'How tall you are!' or 'What a mess you've gotten into!'). The use of the
non-declarative pronouns is an indication that they are not prototypical declaratives. Their major function is certainly not to convey propositional-semantic information. It should also be noted here that the non-declaratives are
sometimes used in poetry in what seem to be declarative clauses. This may
be an indication that their use was more widespread in the grammar formerly.
Aside from these relatively minor uses, the presence of a non-declarative
pronoun constitutes a rather clear indication of the non-declarative status of
the clause in which it occurs. There is some anecdotal evidence that the use
of non-declarative pronouns is at least in some cases more polite than the
corresponding use of ordinary pronouns in the same command or question
would be.","[538, 539, 540, 541]"

Introduction
1.1. The people
The Supyire language is spoken by the Supyire people. The noun süpyfrä, in
effect, has two meanings: 'the people' and 'the language spoken by the people'. The word is used as a name in both senses in this grammar. The
Supyire live in southeastern Mali in the region of Sikasso (see map 1). By
tradition they came from the south, and this is probably historically accurate
since the main body of the Senufo language group, to which Supyire
belongs, is located in northern Cöte d'lvoire (see map 2).
The Supyire are peasant farmers. They cultivate various kinds of cereals
and keep livestock. Traditional political organization did not go beyond the
village level. They have, however, been incorporated into various political
entities in the region. In the last 125 years they have successively been part
of the Jula kingdom of Sikasso, French West Africa, and finally the country
of Mali.
The dialect described in this grammar is spoken in the region of Kampwo,
to the west of Sikasso and bordering the Bambara-speaking region of Gana
(not to be confused with the country of Ghana). The data was collected in
the village of Farakala, located 40 kilometers west of Sikasso on the main
road to the capital Bamako, and from neighboring villages, none more than
15 kilometers from Farakala.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"This type of question is extremely common in greeting exchanges. After an
initial inquiry, a string of 'what about' questions can be used to ask after a
number of different people. Following is a typical exchange. The questioner
is from Farakala, the person replying from Fant6räa:546Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts(70) A:Mu acüügbla?you PERF be.well Q
'Are you well?
B:Mii acüügd.","[568, 569]"
"QTransitivity also affects acceptability of questioning items in complement
clauses. In the loosely bound complements of verbs of speech, the subject of
an intransitive verb can be questioned (note that the same strategy of a resumptive pronoun in subject position is used):
(63)JdMüsä äjwo nauakärdye?who Musa PERF say that s/he PERF go
'Who did Musa say left?",[566]
"QFor many speakers, other items are also sometimes not questionable in complement clauses of this sort. In the following example, some of the people I
consulted on the issue stated that the locative could only belong to the main
clause, not to the complement clause, in spite of the seeming pragmatic bizarreness of such an interpretation (other speakers found that meaning (65b)
was perfectly acceptable, however):
(65)TaiMüsä äjwo naAliέkäiig6?where Musa PERF say that Ali PERF goLOC.Qa. 'Where was Musa when he said Ali had gone?'
(location of Musa questioned)
b. ?'Where is it that Musa said Ali had gone?'
(destination of Ali questioned)544Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech actsWith the more tightly integrated complements of manipulative and perception verbs, the subject can always be questioned since it is also the direct object of the main clause:

a

sä Pyiiri yydre ye?
who they PERF send s/he.COMP PERF go Pierre call Q
'Whom did they send to call Pierre?'","[566, 567]"
"11.3. Manipulative verbs
One of the major parameters in the description of causative constructions has
to do with the strength of manipulation (cf. Givön 1990, chapter 13; Comrie
1976, 1985). From the point of view of the causer, the question is how much
control he or she has over the causee. From the point of view of the causee,
the question is how capable of independent action he or she or it is. Languages tend to reflect these factors iconically in the relative integration of
the coding of the causing and the caused events. In general the more control
the causer has and the less independent the causee, the greater will be the
syntactic integration.",[452]

A number of clause final markers are used in Supyire to indicate mood, polarity, insistence, or politeness. These are generally small, one syllable
words which often cliticize onto the preceding word. Table 29 gives some of
the common markers.",[209]
"11.7. The status of complement clauses
It is time now to address a question which has been held in abeyance during
the preceding discussion: what is the syntactic status of complement clauses
in Supyire? We have so far proceeded as if they were comparable to English
complement clauses (e.g. in the use of the term ""extraposed""), but is this assumption justified? Specifically, are Supyire complement clauses in fact embedded clauses functioning as direct object or subject of a main clause, or
are they simply independent clauses paratactically conjoined with the socalled main clause?
The following discussion will address this question. The conclusion
reached will be that Supyire complement clauses are at an interesting stage
between parataxis and full-scale embedding.",[483]
"5.1.1. First and second person pronouns
There are two sets of first and second person pronouns in Kampwo Supyire.
One set is used mainly in declarative sentences. The other set is used only in
non-declarative sentences such as commands, prohibitions, questions, blessings, vocatives, and exclamations.",[174]
"5.11. Inteijections
Like any language, Supyire has a large, heterogenous class of interjections.
Only a few will be mentioned here. Agreement is shown with odn or aän or
mm 'yes', disagreement with 6nho or mhm ' n o ' . The agreement interjections
are regularly used by a listening interlocutor to indicate that the discourse is
being monitored. This role is extremely important even when the discourse is
a monologue, such as a folk tale, and is known as οοηηίshwo 'to answer the
yes*.
Surprise or disbelief is indicated by a variety of interjections: 6, 6), haan,
0he, päpapä. More elaborate exclamations are greatly favored by some:
bismilahi 'in the name of God' (from Arabic), pätfsägkänä '(exclamation of
surprise or embarrassment)' (from Bambara).
An extremely common interjection is pyi, which can mean a variety of different things, including 'well', 'all right', 'and so'. It is exactly equivalent in
function to Bambara ayiwa.",[209]
"14.2. Questions537Jd is inherently singular. If a speaker wishes to clearly indicate that he or
she believes the unknown referent to be more than one person, the combination 'who and who' can be used:
(44) Jd
ni jd
u ä
pa
ye?
who and who s/he PERF come Q
'Who and who came?'14.2.2.3. ßähä 'what'
By the use of ßähä a speaker indicates that he or she believes the unknown
referent is non-human. It is thus appropriate that for the purposes of agreement, jiähä is gender 2 singular. Note the use of the gender 2 singular pronoun as a place holder for the focused subject question word in the following
example:
(45) βähä ku ßye na
mu k6r6
ye?
what it be PROG you chase.IMPFVQ
'What is chasing you?'
ßähä is used together with the postposition na 'on' or kurugo 'along, by
means of, because o f to question the reason for something, i.e. the equivalent of English 'why':
(46) a. ßähä ηά cydeb/Jä
ä

twice?'pyi
doye?
Qb. ßähä kürügö
pi mäha ßtyke
yaa
what because.of they HAB earth.DEF repair
'Why do they restore the earth?' 11ye?
QIn addition to its use as a pronoun, ßähä can be used as a determiner meaning 'which, what'. It differs from the more common interrogative determiners (see section 14.2.2.6 below) in three ways: it precedes rather than follows the head noun, it takes an indefinite head noun rather than a definite
one, and it does not agree in any way with the head noun. In the following
examples, the noun phrase containing ßähä is an indirect (locative) object:538Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts(47) a. Jlähä känhä

lw5 ye?

which country(G3S) in you PERF get.up Q
'From which country do you come?' Lit. 'In which country did
you get up?'14.2.2.4. dl 'how'
The manner question word dl is borrowed from Bambara dl 'how'. It is usually placed in focus position, as in (48a), but occasionally is put in the position where one would normally expect a manner phrase, viz. after the verb,
as in (48b):
(48) a. Dl
χνύύ si
J) py)
how we FUT it do
'How shall we do it?'ye?
Qb. Mi) ni
mu pyi dl
ye?
I
REC.PAST you tell how Q
'What did I tell you?'
The second example above shows that dl rather than jlähä is often used
when the requested item is something spoken. The standard way of asking
someone's name is accordingly:
(49) D)
mu wäge
jiye ye?
how your name.DEF be Q
'What is your name?' (cf. French: Comment t'appelles-tu?)
Questions with dl often include the verb jwo 'say' as the second verb in a
serial verb construction. Although it is clearly grammaticalized in this function (shown by the fact that it can follow itself—the verb jwo—see example
(50c)), just what the function is remains obscure. The speakers I consulted
on the issue insisted that the question means the same thing with or without
the jwo. One speaker said that often the question sounds more ""natural"" with
jwo, but was unable to say why. The following examples are offered for the
reader to ponder:
(50) a. Dl mil si
i}g6 baqi
jyiile fi-jwö ye?
howl
FUT this river.DEF cross FP-say Q
'How am I going to cross this river?'","[559, 560, 561]"
"11.5. Verbs of speech and cognition
Verbs of speech and cognition can be divided into two groups: 1) a large
group of verbs of saying, knowing, and thinking, and 2) a much smaller
group of verbs of asking, wondering, and doubting. The latter are distinguished by their ability to take indirect question complements. A few verbs
of the first group may belong to the second group (some of them only if they
are negative). The two groups of verbs are examined separately in the final
two subsections of this section (11.5.2 and 11.5.3). The first subsection is
devoted to topics common to the complements of both types of verb: the
contrast between direct and indirect speech, and coreference between the
subject of the main clause and a noun phrase in the complement in indirect
speech.",[466]

The second subtype of 'what about' question consists of a conditional
clause (the protasis of a conditional sentence) with the interrogative particle
d6 appended. The question means 'What if...' (and the solicited reply is the
apodosis of the conditional construction). The following example is extracted
from a discussion on how sorcerers can be detected. The speaker has just put
forward the hypothesis that the suspected person ('you' in the example) has14.2. Questions547been heard to utter a curse against a certain person (the 'him' of the example):

it is all right to spoil the nice things of other people. Speaker Β asserts you

"1.3. Previous research
The only published work on Supyire prior to my own work is an article by
Weimers (1950b) based on one week's investigation of the language. Weimers, who did not speak French, was obliged to communicate with his informant (who came from the village of Molasso, four kilometers to the south of
Farakala) through a missionary, Ralph Herber. Considering the difficulties
of this method and the shortness of the time spent, the amount of information
contained in the article is remarkable. The basic phonological and morphological characteristics of the language are outlined, and a few notes on
syntax included. Certain inaccuracies of detail were unavoidable, however.
Ralph Herber wrote an unpublished pedagogical grammar (n.d.) which he
used to teach other missionaries the language. He considerably refined the
work done by Weimers, particularly in the area of tone, and I am indebted to
him for making his notes available to me, and also for answering numerous
questions.
Turning to other Senufo languages, the picture is not much different. Most
work has been done on the central Senufo languages, spoken in northern
C5te d'Ivoire. Weimers (1950a) is a sketch of Senanri, the dialect spoken in
Korhogo, along the same lines as his article on Supyire. Mills (1984) is a
phonology, and Mills (1987) is a pedagogical grammar of the same dialect.",[25]
