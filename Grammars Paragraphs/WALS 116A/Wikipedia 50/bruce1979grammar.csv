"C onunents about diachronic processes are included atrelevant points, particularly regarding questions in phonology,
verb conjugations, and tense markers.",[21]
"The morphophonemic level isdispensed with which in directly allows the notion of complete
phon emic overlap (in alternatin g morphemes) into the description.
The question of how abstract the phonological analysis should be
is considered and a highly constrained solution allowing some
c ompletely abstract un derlying forms is proposed.",[22]
"On the other hand,an effort has been made. to facilitate the use of this granunar
in cross-lingui9t� c comparisons by other linguists, e.g., by
cross-referencing between sections of the grammar, by discussing
subsystems in one place in the grammar as well as discussing the
units in those subsystems in the different parts of the granunar
where they actually function, and by correlating certain Alamblak
facts with current investigations in universal grammar.
The granunar contains comments on certain theoretical
questions where the structure of Alamblak is particularly
re-levant.",[21]

re- interpreted in the f i r s t person dua l and p lura l , s econd
pe rson , and third person s ingular forms for the immediate past
and in the first person dual and p lural forms in the pre sent75tens e . The boxed- in forms in the paradigms are the re- inter­
preted forms .
I n Tab l e 9 / a y / has become phonetica l ly [ i ] in the f i rs t and
second person s ( as it i s in the lS form by a regul ar phonological
de rivation ) and [ c ] in the third person s ingu lar ( as i t is in
the 3 D and P L . forms ) . S ome pos s ib le inf luencing fac tors which
may he lp explain the re- interpretat ions are 1 ) paradigmatic
coherence ( Kipar s ky 1 9 7 2 : 2 0 6 - 1 3 ) , 2 ) the i n f l uence o f the phonetic
va lue on formulations of under lying forms ( c f . Hale ' s discuss ion
in Hale 1 9 7 3 ) , and 3 ) the rule change of the younger spe ake rs
whe reby a y fuse s into [ c ] be fore a lveopa lata l s a s we l l as non­
a lveopa lata l s .
The f i r s t and second person forms ( p + t h i ) of the immediate
pas t ten$e paradigm wi l l concern us f i rs t . The f i r s t person
s ingular form appears to be the mode l upon whi ch the other s tem
forms are based . S ince the f i r s t person s ingu l ar form derive s
from the under lying phonemic form through at l e a s t two s teps
(
a y-a
A y -a
i - a ) , it is pre s umab ly more s usceptible to
the pre s s ure of phoneti c-phonemi c con formi ty . I f the under lying
form of the f i r s t person s i ngul ar s tem- final vowe l is re- inter­
preted a s / i / , then the other f i r s t person and second person
s tems become / i i - final by analogy .
The fact that the / t y / s equence i s neve r mani fes ted as such
phone t i c a l ly , but a lways as [ i ] or [ + ] plus [ alveopalata l ] means
that / t y / i s a comp le te ly ab s tract underlying form . Although
s uch ab s tract forms may l e gi timate ly exi s t synchronica l ly for a
whi le , there i s certainly a s trong tendency for such underlying
forms to be re interpreted in te rms o f the i r phonetic va lue .
There are two phono logical reason s , there fore , for the first
person s ingular form o f / p t t h a y - a / 'I ta l k e d ' to be re- inter­
preted ( l ike the s ur face form) as / p t t h i - a / . The phonetic
der ivation from / a y / to [ i ] i s a comp l icated one and [ i ] is the
mani f e s tat ion of a highly abs tract s equence / t y / in many cases
which pre s umab ly exe rts an inf luence e l s ewhere for [ i ] to be
inte rpreted as a phoneme .
I n the third pe rson s ingular forms on Tab le 9 [ c ] has
vy
rep laced the regular [ a ] ( c f . Table 7 ) . The a lveopalatal [ R ]*+*+I\.Iand [ s ] have remained , howeve r . The resultant forms may be
de s cr ibed by removing f rom the phonology , P Rule 5 ( fu s i on o f
p lus a lveo l a r ) . With a n underlying
P Rule 6 produce s
Y
[ p + t + 1 § a y R ] and the [ a y ] sequence remains intact to fuse to [ e ]
according to P Rule 2 3 .
A re- interpretation l ike thi s in the third person forms
s impl i fi e s the phonology by removing one rule ( 5 ) and general­
i z ing ano the r
become s avai l able a long with other a lveo­
palata l s to act as a modi fying envi ronment for a s s imi lation
rule 6 ) . Thi s factor plus re- interpre tations in the f i r s t and
second person forms enhance s . paradigm coherency by he lping to
reduce s tem var i at ion s from three to two d i f f�rent phonetic
forms . Thi s s imp l i f i cation in the paradigm , howeve r , re sults
in a comp l i cation in the grammar in genera l , as Kiparsky ( 1 9 7 2 :
