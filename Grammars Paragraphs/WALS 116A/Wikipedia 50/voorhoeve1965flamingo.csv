When, however, the verb following after aj relates to the past, then

12 The habitual category13s
This category, like categories 13 to 15, inclusive, and 18 to 21, inclusive,
is a tense-aspect category with separate characteristics of form for
indicating time and aspect. In this category, as in the two previous
categories, a series of formal and a series of informal forms occur.
These two series are, in addition, opposed to a third series of forms
which express a particular mood of the speaker, such as, for example :
joy, excitement, vexation, disappointment. These forms I shall call
mood forms. The formal and the informal forms are, in this respect,
neutral. I n addition, a few interrogative forms were noted. These occur
only in the traditional stories. I get the impression that they have an
archaic character. Outside the traditional tales, I found in questions only
the non-interrogative forms, followed by the question marker en/an.17

I did find a number of informal forms: these, however, do' not form

informal interrogative forms characterized by the suffix -an. My informants, however, always used a construction with the question

they referred to the action or the happening as such ; for example, when
I asked them ""What's 'to goy"", they replied ""ma-jdr"". ""What's 'to

The question is, how do these forms stand as regards the core which
can also indicate an action or a happening as such? It is out of the
question that this is an idiosyncracy of my informants, for Drabbe 9
had the same experience with his informants from Ajam.10 It occurs
to me that these forms only differ from the affixless core in having
a semantic element of explanation, or clarification. This idea is supported by the fact that in categories 12, 14, 16 and 17, forms also
occur that are characterized by a prefix m-/mV- which seems to differ
loan-word from Malay.

238I shall now deal with a number of words that have no rnorpho'logical
valence and which cannot yet be classified into a definite word-class
because the material is insufficient for this purpose. That I have,
nevertheless, divided them into negations and postpositions is due to
the fact that the negations, at least, have a feature common to them,
one which is not found in the postpositions : only specific forms of the
verb can occur before negations. The feature characteristic of the
postpositions is that they always occur at or within the end of a
word-group.43
The syntactical valence of the negations and postpositions, like that
of the interrogatives, is still not fully known to me. In so far as I have
been able to determine it with certainty will it be mentioned, and
examples will be given.
In additioln, cases will also be given of the occurrence of negations and
postpositions in sentences of which the syntactical structure has not
yet been determined.
The negations and postpositions will be dealt with in the following
order :11. The postpositions: on the basis of their function, these can be
divided into :
1. emphasizing words : arhÂ¥wnat, man
2. conjunctions : am, win, enerim/edm,
44
3. question markers : en/an, open/pen, am1
4. the dubitative marker : ew
5. the irrealis marker : a j
The only exception to this is en$rIwl/e~/ti~
which is always placed between
proper names.
44 There are still three other conjunctions : rn~.vi~zcrimfwiasnerim/maserittz/
mi.sZrtnz/masnim then; w&
again; mariw,/mar&w/Â¥~nart/ntar
- at last,
finally. These link word-groups with word-groups. These words will not be
discussed here because this is not possible without a previous investigation
into the syntax.","[175, 176]"

"INTRODUCTION7where the investigation was later to be carried on. Mifekpic had even
spent part of his childhood there.
My relationship to the two boys developed from the outset on the
'anak piara' 12 pattern: they called me their 'father' and were regarded
as my 'children'. They were paid in cash for their assistance. They
were given a meal every day, and now and then some clothes and
tobacco. With their wages they could buy clothes, tobacco, and the
highly prized axes and chopping knives at the shop in Agats. The
relationship with these informants was a very good and personal one
throughout the whole undertaking. They worked with enthusiasm and
pleasure, apart from some unavoidable lapses.
Because the boys were still rather young, their knowledge of their
mother tongue, of tradition and of mythology was sometimes inadequate
for the translating of the folk tales I collected. The help of an older
man was then enlisted for the interpretation of mythological matters
and special usage. In addition, all the Asinat people with whom I conversed acted as informants. The information received from them was
always checked again with the regular informants.
The reason I chose two of the latter was primarily to enable me to
control the information given by the one by that provided by the other
and vice versa. Another reason was that the boys' capacity for work
was rather small, especially in the beginning - an hour at a stretch
was more than enough for them. Later, when they had been properly
trained, they could sustain a session of two hours or longer without
difficulty. No fixed scheme of questioning was followed at these
sessions. The discussion began on a particular subject and developed
as it went along, depending upon the mood of the informant. The boys
were never prevented from giving information spontaneously, even if
it were not relevant, but sometimes they had to be guided along a fresh
track back to the original subiect. If it became apparent that an answer
to a question about a particular matter was not forthcoming readily,
either because the boy did not understand me, or because he had had
enough, then it was put on one side. Later, a casual return to it often
produced good results. If one of them gave information on a subject
and it differed from that which the other had furnished, then these
variations were discussed in the presence of both of them. And sometimes it then became clear that they held differing opinions regarding
the pronunciation of particular wolrds, or their meaning.
12 The Indonesian word for foster-child,THE ASMAT LANGUAGE7 Tape recordingA portable tape recorder was used extensively for the collecting
of the language data and the music. Thus texts and music could always
be got without difficulty. Only once was I requested not to record
a sacred song. The Asmat people were delighted to hear their own
music reproduced. Western music meant nothing to them. They were
not much interested in the texts, though this did not alter the fact that
the audience always listened critically and expressed their disapproval
in a very positive fashion of any deviations from the version they knew.
The analysis of the texts collected appeared to be of great value for
an understanding of the language and it was through these that I came
upon the track of the special forms of the Asmat verb which express
varying moods.
The language of the folk tales would not appear to differ from
common usage. Asmat songs, however, have their own vocabulary
which is known only to the older people, particularly the singers.
These latter were, however, less inclined to be con~municativeabout
it to strangers.
8 Research in Ag-ats and JepemI began the investigation at Agats, but since Agats was completely
outside the sphere of Asmat society - it was a 15-minute walk from
Surh - I decided, once I had surmounted the first difficulties of the
language, to continue it in one of the Asmat villages in the vicinity
of Agate. By living amidst the Asmat people I would be able quietly
to observe the way in which Asmat society functioned and would
become acquainted with the people and their language. Surfi was less
suitable as a place in which to stay because the presence of the Government and the Missions had to a certain extent already influenced the
way of life there. The village of Jepkm, where both my informants
had relatives, appeared to be the most suitable, and from May, 1961,
the investigation was carried on from there, interrupted from time
to time by a short sojourn in Agats.
During the period of my stay in the Asmat region, the Dutch scholar,
Dr. A. A. Gerbrands, and the American student D. B. Eyde, were
also there: the former doing research into Asrnat art, similarly under
the auspices of W.O.N.G., and the latter doing ethnological field work.
Their presence was of great value in acquiring as good an insight asINTRODUCTION9possible into Asmat culture. Many were the pleasurable and stimulating
discussions we had when we were together, either in the house of
the W.O.N.G. in Agats or at the 'Wong Club', as Dr. Gerbrands'
house in the village of Amhamkaj was called. During the last year,
a lively correspondence on mythological and linguistic subjects was
kept up with Eyde. A knowledge of mythology seemed to be of the
greatest importance for acquiring an insight into Asmat culture, and
it was for this reason that I put as many tales as possible on the tape.
I collected approximately 80 texts, but these represent only a fraction
of the wealth of stories the Asmat people know.","[18, 19, 20, 21]"

V ADJECTIVES
Characteristics
199Words from which derivatives can be formed with the following suffixes
will here be termed adjectives :Since, as far as morphological valence is concerned, there is a distinct
similarity to the substantives, it is legitimate to. ask the question whether
there is here a separate class of adjectives. There are three arguments
which plead for the existence of a special class :1. the semantic value of -nakdp and -nakds differs clearly from the
semantic value which these suffixes have when they are added to
a substantive;138THE ASMAT LANGUAGE2. the po~~sibility
of suffixing -Mi,a productive process', that does
not occur with the substantives;3. the word jiwina-kdp occurs as a derivative substantive with the
meaning of 'small child' (see 5 191), and as an adjective, with
the meaning of 'small'. I t is po'ssible here to' conclude that this is
a case of transposition, a conclusion strengthened by the fact that
from jiwmakd-p 'small*,derivatives can be formed with -nakdp(iriw)
and -pidm (see $ 204).
Morphological valencegoo
The suffix -nakdp has here the semantic value of 'much, to a high
degree' :j i c slack
s k i quick
kiki close togetherjimtnak$ very slack, weak

"THE ASMAT LANGUAGECodtpacak is part of the history of the origin of the Majit
group in S u r k The locale of the story is the Sepkr, a sidestream
of the Sir& (see map 11). In the past, the people of Majit lived
for some time on the Seper.
($Â 280 - 302). Narrator: L4sd$ar, the mother of my informant,
Nafinb/z. This story is about the origin of sago - the only stolry
told by a woman. It differs in various details from the story of
the origin of sago told to me later by Warsdkowien, the chief ofthe ceremonial house A r in Sum. Because this is the origin
myth of the most important food of the Asmat people, I shall
give a short summary of both versions :
In A s w r ' s version, Miwirpic wants to marry the younger sister
of his wife, Tewerawtic. When the girl expresses her nmvillingness to' become his wife, he takes the two. women with him to
the upper course of the Sirec. There he finds a sago palm which
he looks after until the sago1 can be extracted. In the meantime,
he gets Tewkrawuc to1 make a huge bag. H e chops down the
sago palm and instructs the women in the extraction of the sago.
While he' is on his way home with the heavy bag full of sago on
his back he sinks into a morass, still bearing the bag. During- the
night he changes into a sago palm which makes the sago palms,
scattering them everywhere. I t has, however, 110 crown. On the
following day the women return to look for him. Tew6rawuc puts
her sister upside down on Miwirpic and she changes into the
crown of the sago palm, her legs and arms, sticking up towards
the sky, become its fronds. Tewerawuc then returns alone to her
village and introduces the sago to' the people.
In W d k o m e n ' s version, Miwirpic goes alone to look for sago.
He threads on a thorn which he then plants. From it grows the
first sago palm. Helped by his wife, he then extracts the sago.
On his way bade, he and the bag full of sago' sink into a morass.
At night he changes into a sago palm which scatters its fruit
everywhere and so spreads the sago palm.
Warsekornen told me that he did not know the version given
by Asepar and claimed that it was incorrect. The question arises
in this connection, whether Asepar's version may be tolld only
by women. Unfortunately I was not aware of this during' the
time I was staying with the Asmat people. It is noteworthy that
various procedure's in the kaware feast held on the Mimika Coast,
bear a strong resemblance to some of the events described inTEXTS183Askpar's version. 1
VII. VIII. & IX. Narrator: Wow&&, a young man from Jepkim,
approximately 16 years o'f age. These three stories all have as
their subject matter a contact with supernatural being's. These
were told to me as true happenings.
I n VII. ($$ 303 - 306), he tells about the woman, Pajbmpari,
and the consequences following intercourse with a spirit from a
river which passes itself off as the man she desires.
In VIII. (@ 307 - 315), Worninen tells how he himself was
taken off by a spirit girl who wanted to marry him, and was
finally brought back.
I n IX. ( 5 % 316- 320), he tells how his father once had an
encounter with his ancestors when he was searching for fish.
X.
($8 321 - 344). Narrator : Simni, chief of the ceremonial house
Aw6r in Surii; approximately 55 years of age. This story tells
about a famine in the coastal regions which made it necessary
for the people living in the area to join villages further inland.
It describes in detail the fate of the people of J e p h when they
went to the village of Serkw, and how the majority of them were
slain there. The story is a tari atakdm, a story regarded by the
Asmat people as historical. The happenings describ8ed in this
story must have taken place at least a cen-tury ago.2
The only description of the kaware feast known to me is in the unpublished
notes of the Dutch Roman Catholic missionary, Father G. Zegwaard, M.S.C.,
which date from 1952. Father Zegwaard associates this feast with two origin
myths of which the Asmat equivalents are the stories of Fimiriw, and
Tonjenap and Mujenap. The first story tells of the origin of mankind, the
second, of a number of plants. In my opinion, various parts of the kaulare
feast clearly relate to happenings in the myth, told by Asipar, i.e.,
the plaiting of a very large basket, followed by the young men carrying very
heavy objects ;
the ritual chopping down of the tree of which the trunk is to provide the
central pole of the house of the feast. When the tree is to be chopped down,
the crown foliage is first stripped off and then a man climbs to the top. Here
he is cliscovered by women who are out looking for him. He spits chewed
leaves onto those below ( = sago fruit ?);
the ritual banging end-to-end of the broad ends (called the 'heads') of two
poles. This could be a re-enactment of the young TewGrawuc being placed,
head-to-head, on Miwirpic.
In view of the preceding, the Kkmoro word k m a r e could be connected
with the Asmat word coworb, the extreme end of a frond of the sago palm.
This view is supported by the fact that Kkmoro words often have k where
the Asmat words, corresponding to them, have c,

"PHONOLOGY15The possibility of this [a] occurring only in a consonantal environment in which the other vowels do not occur, is excluded by the
occurrence of word pairs, like the following:[Eam'en] = penis[Eem]
= house
[Eam'an] = space under the house
[turnran] = a burn
[Eim'in] = the temple (of the head)
[combfit] = sponge made of young sago leavesThe following minimal pairs were also found :
[csmren] penis; [cm/en] stem of a canoe;
[and'ow] mother ; [oncTow] thatch ;3
[&porfes]they saw him (from por - to see) ;
[&parfes] they sat (from ap - to sit).
Since [a] occurs in the accented as well as the unaccented position
in those cases in which it alternates with the other vowels, it is not
possible to regard it here as an allophone common to /a, e, i, o, u/
which is restricted to unaccented positions. Because [a] also occurs
without alternating with the other vowels, in which cases I found
some minimal pairs, it must be regarded as a phoneme be/. Cases
of alternation must be regarded as cases of phoneme alternation.
The phoneme / E / is then distinguished from the other vowels by
its different behaviour, and because it is the only vowel phoneme
without allophones.
19
To sum up one can say that the vowel phonemes form a system of
three contrasting tongue heights. At the highest level, there is a
contrast front - back /i - u/; at the middle level, a contrast front central - back /e - C - o / ; while at the lowest level only /a/ occurs:According to my informants, the word [ond'Gw] was used only by the people
who originated from the village of Kajt?. I had the impression that now only
the older people within this group use it. The younger people, as well as the
non-Kaj2 people in Suru, use the form [~nd'Gw].","[26, 27]"

284'Tewir, make a carrying bag"" he said. Each night he disappeared into
the forest. There was only one goodly young' sago palm; it stood there
with broad-based fronds. There was only the ordinary forest by the
Sir&. There were no sago palms; there was no sago' forest. The man
got to work; he made an open space. He pulled off the old fronds
from the young palm. Time and again he looked at it: ''You're a
beauty !"" I t rose up like lime which is thrown about."" Finally it grew
into a wux6~;(then) it became a copon. * The man stood guard by it.
At last it had grown large and high. He told his wife to make a bag,
a bag plaited with the fibres from the roots of the pandan tree. The man
got the roots ; he stripped off a great quantity of roots and put them
down together for his wife, ""Tewer, I've just stripped off a great
amount of pandan roots t o make the bag with; d r y them, put them in
the sun to dry quickly!"" he said. ""All right,"" said his wife, and she
spread out the roots in the sun; she laid them down neatly in the sun.
""Now, plait the bag; are the roots dry yet?"" ""Yes, they were already
quite dry yesterday; they were already quite dry the day before yesterday."" ""Fine, start the plaiting, work loose the fibres,"" he said. Now,
the sago palm had grown into a fully grown palm. A large fully grown
palm. ""It's huge! Quickly, it mustn't f l ~ ~ w e""r he

grass, yes, that can be plaited in a day, but a fibre bag, even if the
plaiting is done without interruption, that can't be done! You don't
really mean that,"" she said.
285She worked loose many fibres for the bag and she started to1 plait it,
and she plaited an enormous bag. ""Miwirpic, 'the bag is perhaps too
large,"" she said. H e looked at it. ""No, work loose still more of those

tinder control - the area was notorious for head-hunting-. Only in 1954
did the Government finally s'et up its seat there, at Agats, though the
Roman Catholic Mission had opened its first Mission station there
in, 1953. It was also at Agats that the Protestant Mission (The
Evangelical Alliance Mission, TEAM for short) began its activities
in this region in 1955.6
I t is my opinion that, from the diachronical point of view, the word bsmat,
or h o t , is possibly a compound formed with the word for 'tree', now os,
and a generic element, now amof, m o t , which is found in compounds like
ser-amot - ser fish (species of), and probably also in the word setmot, set
bird (species of), the name of one of the ceremonial houses (Jew) of Surh.
The name Asmat would then be consistent with a tradition that the people
sprang from trees,
I have to thank D. E. Eyde for this information which he came upon by
chance. It is noteworthy, that a concept of the world common to all the
Asmat people, which is not sacred and is spoken of openly, has for so long
escaped the attention of European investigators.
There is a more detailed description of the first contacts of the Asrnat people
with the outside world, and olf the establishment of Government, the Roman
Catholic Mission and the Protestant Mission in these regions in: V. F. P. M.
van Amelsvoort, Early Introduction of Integrated Rural Health into aTHE ASMAT LANGUAGEInvestigation into the language spoken in the territory inhabited by
the Asrnat people, as in so many regions in New Guinea, was first
undertaken by the Roman Catholic and Protestant Missions. The
Dutch Missionary, P. Drabbe, who lived in Agats from 1957 to 1959,
made a study of the dialect of the village of Ajam, 20 miles further
upstream. I n addition, he collected material on various other dialects.
His grammar of the Ajkm dialect, with a vocabulary, as well as a
comparative study of three Asmat dialects, have been published.7
The TEAM linguist, C. Rolesler, is still working on the A j b dialect,
and Mrs. Dresser, the wife of the TEAM doctor at Pirimaphn, Cook
Bay is making an initial study of the Asmat of the Casuarinen Coast.
To date, their work has not been published.
4 Present research, choice of dialectThe following description of the language is the result of an investigation into the coastal dialect around Flamingo Bay which was
carried out from November, 1960, to September, 1962, under the
auspices of the Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Nieuw-Guinea
(W.O.N.G.).s
The aim of this research was the collecting of material for a description of one of the Asmat dialects. Outside Mission circles in New
Guinea, almost nothing was known about Asmat. Drabbe's grammar
of the Ajkm dialect had been published, though this fact was not
known to me until I arrived in the area, and found that the Mission
disposed over a few copies of it. The only thing on Asmat I had had
at my disposal was a short vocabulary at the end of Drabbe's KAmoro
grammar. Thus a preliminary orientation into the language was not
possible. The investigation had to be started from scratch,
For some time the Roman Catholic Mission had been opening
schools in the Asmat region, the language taught in them being Malay,

contains a complete bibliography of works containing information on Asmat,

an aspect suffix - o h , and another series with an aspect suffix -erm/-er.
Though the formal contrast between the two series shows great similarity with that between the formal and the informal series of the habitual
category, there does not appear to be a division into formal and informal
forms. The forms with - e m / - e r were only found with the verb e / j

occur here instead of the forms with - c h . The two series appear to be

it will become clear that there is a close connection between /i/ and /u/,

126Modal suffixes : -c ; -er/-Zr/zero.15
-c occurs with the formal forms.
The following occur with the informal forms :
-er before C
-Zr before V ; after the core-final r, zero always occurs.
Object suffixes ; peculiarities :
111. in forms 6/8 zero occurs instead of -aw.
Subject suffixes ; peculiarities :
3rd. pers. s. in forms 6 / 8 : -aw occurs instead of zero.
3rd. pers. pi.: a feature occurs here which is also found in the
following categories: when combined with the subject suffix -ex of the
3rd. pers. pi., the object suffix -en only relates to the speaker and the
person spoken to:
tetdm-chh if they give me, you (sing.).
If the object-suffix relates to1 the persons spoken to, then the subject
suffix of the 3rd. pers. pi. is zero and the form is like that of form Not, 7 :

b. if they give it to youPrefixes
A. zero, a-:
a- was only found before cores having one vowel and beginning with
a consonant. An exception is the core fewer to take, of which forms
were found with and without prefix a-.
15For reasons unknown to me the informants always used the informal forms
with cores ending in es, it and awir, and the formal forms with cores ending

"24THE ASMAT LANGUAGEwide departure from a smooth or undulating contour"".g By 'departure'
Bolinger means a deviation in a contour which then continues in the
- or
same pitch - ' or - -, as well as a sudden rise fall - , after which it continues on a higher or a lower level.
w i t h r e g a r d to Asrnat, it could be established that in most cases
the accent is accompanied by a clear and sudden rise or fall of the
pitch. Four cases can be distinguished :1. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the rest of the contour:2. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the contour preceding it :3. The accented vowel has a lower tone than the contour preceding it:---4. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the contour following it:It is clear that in 3, and 4 'pitch' alone does not determine the
accent. There must be other factors that cause the difference. Bolinger,
who describes a parallel case in English, attributes the determination
of accent in this case to different factors: context, phonetic reduction,
and contiguous 'unaccentables3.10 It is not possible, however, for me
to determine in how far similar factors are also active in Asmat This
would require special investigation.
There are also cases in which I noted accent without being able
to discern a deviation in the pitch by ear. In some of these cases it
could be established that the accented vowel was rather longer than
the contiguous non-accented vowels. It was often not possible, however,
to determine by ear what the accent-determining factors were.3-1

14 The progressive formsIn this category there occur a series of no'n-mood forms and one series
of mood forms'. i n addition, a number of interrogative forms was found
which appear to be used exclusively in traditional stories. A dual form
of the 3rd. pers. occurs in the non-mood series. In contrast to the dual
forms of the hortative category, this one appears to be unproductive.
Until now, I have only found it in texts which were narrated by a
couple of old men who were approximately 50 or 60 years old. In these
texts, the dual form was not used consistently by the narrators. The
informants knew these dual forms, but in practise they made no
distinctioln between the 3rd. pers. pi. and the 3rd. pers. dual.

and reached the village. Because of the sago, there was no room in the
houses to sit down. ""All right, tomorrow the floor covering for the
ceremonial house and also the rafters - the day after tomorrow the
thatch must be on,"" they said. For [the feast for] the ceremonial house
they didn't cut down sago palms to get the sago grubs. They wanted
an excuse to murder the men from the coast, so they began the feast.
They began the feast for the new ceremonial house in order to' kill
them in the ceremonial house. The next day, they took the canoes
to the water so that they could fetch the rafters and the floor covering,
They laid many large rafters 011 it. The following day, they danced
the whole night and sang the t e s h song. I n the morning, they laid
the thatch. They laid the thatch in the morning' and then, at noon, they
sat and sang the pir song - no, in the afternoon they sang- the pir song
- and they jigged up and down, up and down, up and downa. The
woman with whom Atiripic had coupled said : ""Our brother, his wives,
and his children must go upriver tonight."" Then her husband tried to
bend a very large strong bow that lay there. He tried it, and again
he tried it, - it was fine - and he put the bow down for him [with
a thud], as though he stamped his foot. He fetched a large spear
from above for him. From above, he fetched a big bundle of arrows
for him. ""I put them down for you,"" he said, ""should the men pursue
you, you must kill diem."" And when it was night they sent Ataripic
away to the upper course of the Aw.

I l l THE ACCENTIntroduction
39To the most recent investigations in the field of accent belong the
studies of the American linguist D. L. Bolinger. In 1958, the results
of a number of experiments he had made were published.8 These
showed that the most important cue in determining stress in English
is what he terms 'prominence of pitch', i.e. ""a rapid and relatively
I owe this term to: K L. Pike, Phonetics, University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, 1958, p. 93.

"Categorial meaningThe forms of this category indicate that the action or the happening
took place regularly over a certain period of time. They differ semantically from the forms of the habitual category in that they relate to
that part of the past that goes back from yesterday as far back as the
generations still alive can recall from their own experience. This period
I have called the mediate past (see also 5 105, note 6) in contrast to the
ultimate past which covers the remaining part of the past.
