"More intricate is the question of sand h. No minimal pairs are
found showing the opposition between these consonants. And not only
that, but some words having s occur side by side with words having
the same meaning and the same form except for h instead of s. These
cases are:semit3 and hemit3 - food
sne and hne - breathless, panting
setJgo and het3go - only
senat3 and henat3 - traditional, holy
so and ho - to, in regard to ; also the pronominal forms corresponding
to this,20 e.g. k6mso and komho - to you.

An exception is the interjection hui. But there are more instances of interjections deviating from normal rules of phonological structure (see Ch. II,
§ 3, and Ch. VI, § 14).

those words which are characterized by the absence of a certain formal
feature. It is clear that this is just another way of saying that a certain
element of form is absent and that this absence determines the place
of the word, or words, in question within the morphological framework
of the language.
In our discussion of Nimboran morphology we will time and again
come across cases which can be described with the term zero morpheme.
In some cases we will even have to speak of zero root-morpheme.
6. Productivity.","[63, 64]"
"PHONOLOGY2SAs the relation between sand h will be discussed in the next § and
the opposition between s and the other consonants was shown in the
§§ 1 to 10, only the following examples are given here, demonstrating
the opposition between s and zero:
iaflj - asksiaflj - young man
skie - deep
spou - undo
uso - tadpoleHe - hand
pou - blow
uo - nest12. h.h is a voiceless glottal fricative, occurring word-initially and - only
in some verbal and pronominal forms and in some names - wordmedially. If wo·rd-initial and immediately followed by fIj or n, it may
be actualized as a voiceless nasal of the same point of articulation as
the following nasal, so [IJ] or [N] respectively; e.g. hfljari - bird of
paradise, hnaflj - louse, hnum - know.
But many speakers (probably even a majority) never pronounce
word-initial h which is immediately followed by fIj, n, or r, and say ru
for hru - man, etc. Therefore one might say that these speakers have
zero as an allophone of h in this environment. But this reasoning would
do no justice to the fact that the speakers in question do not have any
opposition between words like:
hnaflj - louse,
hno - a place-name.
hrao - carry,and
and
andnaflj - straddle-legged,
no - he, she, they,
rao - sleep,so that for them these pairs of words are just homophonous forms,
whereas an opposition between them does exist for the other speakers.
In fact this a question of coexistence of an older 17 phase, in which
there is opposition between hflj- and fIj-, between hn- and n-, and
between hr- and r-, and a later phase, in which these oppositions do
not exist, so that more homophonous words are found. The line,
separating these two phases, lies in between individual speakers,18
It is not without reluctance and only for want of better terms, that we
introduce words like ""older"" and ""later"" here in our description. Still, we
are fully convinced that, historically, these terms are right, all the evidence,
produced by comparison with closely related languages, pointing in this
direction.
18 We got the impression that the older phase is found mostly with older
speakers, but the dividing line between the two phases certainly does not
coincide precisely with difference of age.
1726TIm NIMBORAN LANGUAGEalthough it is certainly not beyond possibility that the same speakers
use forms of both phases alternately.
As the opposition between h and the other consonants, except s, has
been discussed in the §§ 1 to 10, it remains to speak of the opposition
between hand s and that between h and zero.
As to the opposition between h and zero, just now we saw that in
certain environments this opposition is not found with all speakers.
The remaining cases of word-initial h are those in which h is immediately followed by a vowel. But words having initial h, immediately
followed by i, y, or u,19 do nOit occur, whereas words having initial
e, a, or 0 are very few in number, so that the possibility for minimal
pairs is extremely limited. The only instance found is that of hambot3 horn, and ambot3 - Ambon, Ambonese (a loanword). Another proof
for the existence of the opposition is given by the fact, that dropping
an initial h (which is immediately followed by a vowel) may affect
the recognizability of the word in question: the (non-existing) word
""ake"" would not be accepted by any speaker of Nimboran as being
identical with hake - torch, but is felt to be different.
Instances of opposition between h and zero in word-medial position
are found in verb-forms, e.g.tet3gat3hake - you knocked theretet3gat3ake - you knocked below.","[36, 37, 38]"
"Morphology is concerned with those words which show a partial
similarity in form and in meaning, in so far as their partial differences
in form and meaning show a systematic character. As there appears
to be a good deal of misunderstanding with regard to this matter, we
have to enter, at least, into the basic principles.
In many languages, including Nimboran, groups of words are found
which show a partial similarity in their forms and also have a common
element in their meanings, whereas each of these words can be opposed
to one or more other words from which they are differentiated by
precisely the same formal and semantic element. Such groups we call
m 0 r p hoi 0 g i c a I cat ego r i e S.l The formal feature(s), shared
by the members of a category, need not be absolutely uniform but may
show some variation, provided that this variation is defined by the
phonemical shape of the word and, therefore, is predictable. If differences are found which are unpredictable, the words in question do not
belong to one category.

These, however, must be regarded as different fonus, as other verbfonus, fully comparable with those in question, have g but never have k

9. '3.1'3 is a voiced dorso-velar nasal; it occurs word-initially, wordmedially, and word-finally, e.g. fJare - myself, fJgYfJ - fall, indiofJeirum Jew's harp.
I,t is fronted, if immediately followed by i or e or by a k or g which
is fronted because of an immediately following front vowel (see § 7
and § 8), and also if word-final and immediately preceded by i, e.g.
fJei - tear, rend, fJgfe - resin, fJgesi13 - wipe off, usf13 - say, tefjgeifJ - cut.
If 1'3 is word-final and the immediately preceding vowel is a, this a
is nasalized [3.]. The same may happen to 0 or tt, if immediately
preceding a word-final 1'3, but then only as a free variant. With some
speakers word-final 13, preceded by a nasalized vowel, is practically
inaudible so th3Jt the 1'3 is mainly represented by the nasalized quality
of the preceding vowel. E.g. ta13gafJ - string, urafJ - long, temufJ remainder, SOfJ - mosquito.
As the opposition between 1'3 and other consonants has been discussed
already in the preceding §§, we here give some instances of minimal
pairs for the opposition between 1'3 and r, s, h, and zero:
130 - I, we
13yei - stir
fJaio - father
bMj - broken
fJuaro13 - fibrous husk of
coconutro - wash
syei - kind of fibre
haio - kangaroo
ba - far
uarofJ - nail10. r.
r is a voiced apico-alveolar vibrant; it occurs word-initially and
word-medially, e.g. karofJ - thorn, fJgrafJ - bumble-fly, kekruab - white,
rer£13 - push, shove.
16La. comparison with related languages makes it very plausible that 9 originally
was only an allophone of k. But this is a historical question which can be
very well left out of discussion here, because now the relation between k and 9
is different.","[34, 35]"
"MORPHOLOGY121heni buen - meager body,
'30 buendatu - I become meager,
hru iaua - a grown-up man,
no iauadakum - she grew up.
In such cases the meaning is ""get into the state (which is denoted
by the lexical meaning)"".
In § 46 we saw that Infinitives may have the function of adjectives.
In other words, the Infinitive form is a means to make verbs into
adjectives. As those members of the category in question which have
corresponding forms in the verbal categories, enumerated above, always
have the form of the Infinitive as the form of their root-morpheme, it
may be said that the Infinitive is the connecting link between that
category and the other categories. The other members which correspond
with adjectives only make it clear that this has something to do with
the adjectival function of the Infinitive.
For this reasons we call this category a Secondary verbal category
and, as it is not the only one of this kind, we call it the First Secondary
Verb Category.
There is one series of forms, belonging to this category, viz.
remedaru - I will change, become transformed (here),
etc., etc.,
the root-morpheme of which (reme-) is not found otherwise.
Moreover, all forms of this category occur with zero root-morpheme:
daru or raru - I will become (here),
etc., etc.
The lexical meaning of this forms is ""become"".
49. The Second Secondary Verb Category.","[130, 131]"
"As Future forms of the Fourth Position category we find:MORPHOLOGY67'I3guasaru - I will bite there, etc.,
bekasaru - I will kick there, etc.,
t8f3gansaru - I will knock there, etc.,
'I3grunsaru - I will hang up there, etc.
In the Fifth Position category we find the Future forms:'I3guanaru - I will bite far away, etc.,
bekanaru - I will kick far away, etc.,
te'l3ganaru - I will knock far away, etc.,
'I3grunaru - I will hang up far away, etc.
All these forms follow the rules, so far established, except for the
tense-morpheme which is -r- in all these forms instead of -d-. As this
appears to be the case with all members of these Position categories,
we state the rule that the morpheme, characterizing the Future category,
is -d- in members of the First Position category and -r- in members
of the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Position categories.
Side by side with the forms of the Fourth Position category, e.g.
'I3guasaru etc. and 'I3guasaku etc., we find forms in which the s is
replaced by h as free variants: 'I3guaMru, 'I3guaMku etc. But these
h-alternants only occur if the consonant in question immediately follows
the root-morpheme and immediately precedes a vowel which has an
accent and is followed by at least one consonant which is not wordfinal. As we shall see later on, these conditions are usually fulfilled
only in the Singular forms of Future and Past.

"Members of this category show the same forms as those of the -ma'3category except for their Actor morphemes which are of the Apophonic

"In Nimboran, as in most languages, borrowing words from other
languages is an important means for enriching the vocabulary.
Especially in recent times, foreign cultural influence has been the
cause of many words being borrowed. The most important lending
language is the lingua franca, which is used - with some regional
variaDJts - in the coastal areas Oof western New Guinea. This language
we call New Guinea Malay (NGM), for want of a better tenn. This
NGM is not very much different frOom Bahasa Indonesia, the national
language of Indonesia, so that in many cases the question, if a word
was borrowed from NGM or from Indonesian, is utterly senseless.
For words, borrowed by Nimboran frOom other languages - among
which in the first place Dutch must be mentioned -, NGM often, but
not always, served as an intennediary. As Indonesian/Malay was
introduced in primary education already years ago, every Nimboran-44THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEspeaker has a certain knowledge of this language .and borrows words
from it freely, not only in high-flown speech-making and in technical
statements, but also in everyday conversation. Especially among the
younger generart:ion, garnishing the language with Malay jIndonesian
words is an established custom, even in those cases in which original
Nimboran words would be as good or even better.
2. Adapted and unadapted loan-words.","[55, 56]"
"In the preceding chapter we stated that every word has its specific
sound-form. These forms consist of sound-units which are called
phonemes. Phonemes differ from each other in distinctive features;
each phoneme may be considered as a bundle of such distinctive soundfeatures.
Phonemes are important means for ·!:'he identification of word-forms
through hearing. The determination of the role, played by any phoneme
in the recognizability of a word-form, is conditioned by several factors,
including the number of phonemes constituting the word,3 ,the existence
(or non-existence) of other words which show a certain degree of
sim~larity in sound-form to the word in question, and the contribution
to the recognizability offered by the context or the situation. In the
practical use of language redundancy of means of identification is of
quite commOon occurrence. The distinctive value of phonemes, their
identificational function, reaches a maximum, when words are isolated
from any context. 4
So the distinctive value of phonemes does not stand out clearly under
all circumstances. On the other hand not all phonemes are the same in
this respect, as they appear to show differences in their possibilities of
mutual combinability and in the places they can occupy in a word-form.
Consequen1'ly, some phonemes have much more chance of showing their
distinctive, identificational, value than other phonemes have. But the
mere fact that a sound-unit's possibilities of occurrence are limited,
need not be a reason for denying its phoneme-status. In the discussion
of1!he separate phonemes we will come across some instances of this sort.
Our description of the phonetic characteristics of the phonemes will
be limited to tJhe way in which the sounds are produced. 5 Of course their
identificational function is connected with their acoustical qualities but,
as we are not able to make a description along these lines, we are forced
to co~fine ourselves to the articulatory characte6stics, as is indeed
common practice.",[20]
"If an Infinitive has initial u, this u is doubled in the corresponding
Final Infinitive, except if the initial It of the Infinitive is immediately
followed by a second u in which case the Final Infinitive has the same
shape as the Infinitive, e.g.
uau - to rasp,
uo - to dibble,uou - to row,
UU13 - to weed,
uuo - to answer,uuau - in order to rasp,
uuo - in order to dibble,
uuou - in order to row,
uU13 - in order to weed,
uuo - in order to answer.",[127]
"The combination of the morphemes of the Iterative and of the Fifth100TIIE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEPosition category appear to result in -net3ga- as the forms in question
are:
t3guanet3gatu - I bite (bit) repeatedly far away,
1Jguanef3gaku - I bit repeatedly far away,
etc.
The Iterative forms of the Sixth Position category do not show any
peculiar features, e.g. :pribekdtu - I throw repeatedly from here to above,
pribekdpu - I threw (today, yesterday) repeatedly from here to
above,
pribekdku - I threw repeatedly from here to above.
They are the same as the corresponding forms of the Second Position
category except for the forms with tense morpheme -t- having for the
Sixth Position category only the meaning of the Present tense, as in
this Position category there is a separate Recent Past tense.
The Iterative forms of the Seventh Position category are the same
as those of the Fourth Position category, except for the existence of a
separate Recent Past tense, e.g.:pripskatu - I throw repeatedly from here to there,
pripskapu - I threw (today, yesterday) repeatedly from here to there,
pripskdku - I threw repeatedly from here to there.
In the Eighth Position category we find Iterative forms like:pripskety - I throw repeatedly from here to below,
pribmensketim - you and I throw repeatedly from here to below,
pripkeskety - we two throw repeatedly from here to below,
priiskety - we throw repeatedly from here to below,
pripskepy - I threw (today, yesterday) repeatedly from here to below,
pripskeky - I threw repeatedly from here to below,
etc.
We see that in all these forms the Iterative morpheme has the
vowel e. This appears to be the case in all forms with Actor morphemes
of the Apophonic series. In the Iterative forms as in the Momentary
forms, the formal opposition between the Seventh and Eighth Position
categories consists in difference of vowels only.","[109, 110]"
"++++The members of this category are:forms with the root-morpheme uu- - answer;
forms with zero root-morpheme and with the lexical meaning ""say

Singular and Plural forms with the root-morphemes ici13- - ask, and
teku- - meet; for these two root-morphemes the Dual is blockaded
by the -ri13- category (see under K.).",[161]
"Words, belonging to different morphological categories but corresponding with each other in form and meaning, constitute a m 0 rp hoi 0 g i c a I set. The formal feature they have in common is a

preceding foot-note, and also: H. Schultink, De morfologische valentie van

Schultink's book a lucid exposition is given of the consequences of the
principles, laid down in Uhlenbeck's article, for morphological research. As
our methods are along the same lines, it is enough for us to state briefly the
outlines and to refer the reader to these two authors. Needless to say that
for the presentation given here only the present author is responsible.

5 Here the same terminological difficulty arises as was found with the term
""morpheme"" (§ 2). An expression like ""basic morpheme"" might have been
used instead of ""root-morpheme"". Bloomfield's term ""kernel"" has to general
a meaning and his term ""stem"" we prefer to use in a different, more specializecl,

the total, non- formal, value of membership of a category and so will
also include the conception of syntactic valence, discussed in the
preceding §. To avoid any misunderstanding, it must be added that
the meaning of a polymorphematic word can not be said to be the sum
total of lexical meaning plus categoric meaning(s); but these meanings
are somehow represented in the total meaning of the word.

Of these languages Gresi and Kamtuk are most closely related. The

3. How the materials were collected.
The data for the present description were gathered in the years 1954
to 1957. In the following years from time to time incidenta:1 additions
were made. The way of collecting data was based on the assumption
that '<lin accur<lite idea of the structure of a language can only be formed
when the 'reseal'cher has acquired a sufficient degree of mastery - both
active and passive - of the language in question. This appeared to be
an exacting and timetaking affair, but was most remunerative. However,
even if the researcher learns to speak the language, he can ill dispense
with the help of informants, because otherwise he might stand in
jeopardy of describing not the language itself but only tht part of it
whioh he has learned to use. On the other hand mastering the language
is a powerful means to the efficient use of informants.
During ;these years so m<liuy people served as informants for the
r'esearch from which the present description has resulted, that it is
imposs~ble to mention all their names. But an exception must be made
£01' Dina N apo, an adolescent girl, who was a daily collaborator f'Or
years. She proved to possess an outstanding intelligence and a natural
gift for linguistic work whioh was not hampered by any preconceived
theory whilch might have made it less easy for her to look upon her
language with an open mind. Very soon she got a dear perception of
the how and why of linguistic research and helped to think out means
to discuss linguistic matters in her own language, showing great powers
of invention in coining grammatical terms -etc. Moreover, she had the
sense not only to check up - in a crafty, subtle way - doubtful points
wi,tIh other informants, but also to be constantly in search for exceptions

"Opposed to:
f3guadu - I will bite (here),
f3guakeMu - we two bite above,
f3guatemetJgetim - he is biting repeatedly below,112THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEand all other forms of this verb, discussed so far, we find:1Jgua - 1° (to) bite, 2° bite!, 3° bitten.
There appears to exist a whole series of such forms, e.g. :ki1J - to pack, pack! packed.
Together, they constitute a productive category. Their formal mark
is the absence of any categorial morpheme: they consist of a bare
root-morpheme. The common seman tical element is less easy to
describe. It appears that some heterogeneous semantical elements are
found side by side, distinguishable in the different cases in which the
forms in question are used:
1° just the absence of all the other categorial meanings, in cases like:no po 1Jgua - he wants to bite,
130 l3gua besam - I refuse to bite.
2° a curt order: 1Jgua - bite! For a more polite order, a friendly request
etc. the Second Person Future is used:l3guade - please, bite! have the goodness to bite!
3° a state, caused by being submitted to the action, attributed to a noun:ndie hru me l3gua - that man is already bitten,
hru l3gua be ndie - the bitten man is there.
This use is the same as that of adjectives, e.g.:ndie hru krap6 - that man is bad,
hru krap6 be ndie - the bad man is there.
This category we call the category of the Infinitive.
The indifference of Infinitive forms in regard to the other categories
is seemingly absent in cases like:tao - to put many objects,
dao - to give (take) many objects,
,.au - to roast many objects,
prei - to bring many objects,
as these could be thought to be connected with the Plural Object
category. However, we must assume that these are Infinitives of verbs,113MORPHOLOGYhaving the semantical element of ""many objects"" as part of their lexical
meaning. In the cases of tao, rau, and prei this becomes quite clear
from other forms which, without being Plural Object forms, still
possess the plural object-element in their meaning. The fact that tao,
dao, rau, and prei and words, morphologically related to them, are
used, by way of suppletion (see Ch. I, § 10), instead of the (nonexisting) forms of the Plural Object category of tey - put, tei - take,
give, dey (dy-) - roast, and a series of forms with zero root-morpheme
to which belongs rebedu - I will bring from here to above, respectively,
is not relevant, as the latter have no morphological connections with
the first.
In the examples, cited above, the form of the Infinitive is the same
as that of the root-morpheme in its combinations with the various
morphemes but not the same as the special Singular or Plural stem,
found with some root-morphemes. This appears to be the case with
the great majority of Infinitive forms, e.g.:nC13ga - to light (etc.),
tC13ga13 - to knock (etc.),
sam - to put inbetween (etc.),
skye - to smoke (etc.),
bie - to open (etc.),
13gri13 - to draw, trail (etc.),
tC13gei13 - to cut (etc.),

trao - to lift (etc.),
dou - to start (etc.),
hru13 - to break (etc.),
siab - to pour out (etc.),
peb - to peel (etc.),
pyb - to stick (etc.),
brub - to fold (etc.).","[121, 122, 123]"
"The members of this category are forms with the following rootmorphemes:

by the element -re- which has its place immediately following the
root-morpheme except in those forms which contain the Dual morpheme -ke- which then precedes the element -re- and takes the form -k-.
The common semantical element can be described as ""the action is
connected with an object, consisting of one or two male beings, not

"The mutual combinability of the consonant-phonemes is much more
limited than that of the vowel-phonemes. With some consonants only
a few combinations occur, whereas others, e.g. m and n appear to have
more possibilities. Concerning the occurrence or non-occurrence of
consonant-sequences there are only three general rules, applying to all
consonants. These rules are:
1° a consonant-sequence can never be word-final.
2° sequences of more than three consonants do not occur; the only
exception is hngr (see below, § 13).23
3° a sequence of two identical consonants does not occur. Consequently
in all polymorphematic words, in which such a sequence could be
expected on account of the constituent morphemes, only one consonant is found (for instances of this see Part Two).
As with these three negative rules not everything is said, we still
have to survey the various consonant-sequences found. They will be
arranged under the heading of the first consonant.
23But this exception is not found with all speakers (see Ch. IV, § 12).",[43]

show a common formal feature. This formal feature becomes apparent
from the comparison with morphologically related words (co-members

worker vs. worked, walker vs. walked, etc. In this example there is
an opposition between words having one categoric morpheme (-er) and
words with a different categoric morpheme.
However, in many cases the formal opposition is found in the
presence of a certain formal feature in the one case and its absence
in the other; e.g., English work and walk as opposed to working and

"Because - as will be shown clearly in our further description - the
form of the root-morpheme found in the Singular forms is much more
limited in its possibilities of occurrence than the form found in the
Dual forms, we take the latter as a norm for the root-morpheme.
The form of the root-morpheme occurring in Singular forms we
call the Singular Stem of the root-morpheme. V.,r ether a root-morpheme
has a special Singular Stem or not, only depends from its phonemical
structure. The rule appears to be: All root-morphemes have the same
form in both Dual and Singular forms, except:88THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEa. root-morphemes ending in -yo These have a Singular Stem ending

driedu - I will defecate (here).","[97, 98, 99, 100]"
"Corresponding with kryedu - I will walk around in search (here),
and kreykedu - we two will walk around in search (here), we find
kryidiu - we will walk around in search (here). In this case the formal
difference between the Plural form and the Singular and Dual forms
is more than that described in § 36, as in the Plural form the e of the
root-morpheme is lacking. Precisely the same is found not only in all
other Plural forms of this verb but also in the Plural forms of all other
verbs having in their Dual forms a root-morpheme ending in -ey, e.g.:'Yjgedeyketu - we two fasten (here),
'Yjgedyitiu - we fasten here,
peykefJ6,kam - they two bailed below,
pyi'Yjakam - they bailed below,
'Yjgeteykesam - they two (masc.) rub there,
'Yjgetyisiam - they rub there.
It is clear that this peculiarity has something to do with the phonemical
structure of the root-morpheme. As more peculiarities of this kind are
found, the rule about the formal characteristics of the Plural category
asks for an addition. It appears that the following rules must be added:a. root-morphemes ending in -ey have -yi in Plural forms.

"17PHONOLOGYIf word-final, b is always unreleased, or bett(;(: nasally released.
In this position it may be voiceless; the formal opposition between band p then lies in the difference of release, as word-final p normally
is orally released.
If a word has final b and syntactically is closely connected with an
immediately following word and if the latter has an initial consonant,
the b may be very lax so that it is hardly audible, e.g. be'l3gib d6u'13 - salt
(lit.: sea-kernel).
A small minOority of speakers has a habit of actualizing word-final b
as a. voiced labio-velar stOoP with nasal release.
Opposition between b and the other consonants (except p, for which
see the preceding §) and zero may be seen from the following instances:

It is in free variation with voiceless lamino-alveolar stop W], if
immediately followed by i, e.g. tie - grub. If this immediately following

may also be actualized as a voiced lamino-domal stop [(n, e.g. dio gathering, indiufj - kind of arrow.
As examples for the opposition between d and bilabial consonants

nande - whose?
ndao - feeli6 - we
nane - who?
nao - break6. n.n is a voiced apico-dental nasal; it occurs word-initially, wordmedially, and word-finally, e.g. nandu - yesterday, kenai - above,
ndien - leaf-vein.
The occurrence of n in word-final position is limited to:
the clan-names uaipon and uaisimon,
the word namuan - two,
a number of words in which the final n is immediately preceded by
the vowel-sequence ue or ie} e.g. buen - lean, teiyien - kind of bird.
It is a remarkable fact that no minimal pairs are found for the
opposition between n and 13 in word-final position. Moreover, final n
of foreign words which are borrowed by Nimboran is often replaced
by 13, e.g. sabulJ - soap, from Malay sabun.
Further, a form uaipolJ occurs as a free altemant side by side
with uaipon.
In view of all this there might be occasion to consider word-final n
as an allophone of 13 (or the reverse). This would mean that the
opposition between n and 13 is neutralized in word-final position. Against
this are the following facts:
1° Mutual substitution of nand 13 - also in word-final position - is
felt by Nimboran speakers as the making of new words.
2° Only in the case of immediately preceding ue or £e the occurrence
of word-final n would be environmentally conditioned.
3° Comparison of namuan with e.g. hambua'13 (- tobacco) shows the two
sound-units in equivalent environments.
4° The form uaipolJ (side by side with uaipon) is undoubtedly a product
of popular etymoJogy: an attempt to invest this name with the
meaning ""see the sun"" (uai pOlJ).
For these reasons word-final n may best be regarded as a normal
form of the phoneme n} although of limited occurence.
n is in free variation with a voiced lamino-alveolar nasal [nY] , if
immediately followed by i} e.g. meni - other, some. The lamino-alveolar
allophone always occurs, if the n is immediately followed by the lamino-PHONOLOGY21alveolar allophone of t, d, or s (see § 11), e.g. menti13 - algae, ndie - this,
that, ansi13 - come here!
If n is immediately followed by an i which has no accent and is
immediately followed by a vowel, besides the lamino-alveolar allophone,
already mentioned, also a voiced lamino-domal nasal [1)'] occurs in
free variation, e.g. minie - before, iniom - middle. The lamino-domal
allophone always occurs, if n is immediately followed by the laminodomal allophone of t, d, or s (see § 11), intiym - screen, cover, indio mother, insium - mouse.
As examples for the opposition between n and the bilabial consonants,
t, and d are given in the §§ 1 to 5, we here give some instances of
minimal pairs, showing the opposition between n and the other consonants and zero:nab - spirit
mana - mythological name
no - he, she, it, they
na1'3 - louse

heni - ill
nao - break
nu - sight

heri - you will go
sao - chase away
su - walk on!
haku - areca-nut
handa1'3 - try
di - wood
mesy - small bead
nae - sale7. k.k is a voiceless dorso-velar stop, occuring word-initially and wordmedially, e.g. krom - grindstone, karey - quagmire, bciky - dance,
keikcio - narrow.
k is slightly fronted, if it immediately precedes i or e, e.g. keki - raw,
He - hand, iakey - crumble.
Word-initial k may be rather lax, if the word in question is syntactically closely connected with the immediately preceding word and
the latter has a final vowel. e.g. di kekuye - bush, shrub.
As examples for the opposition between k and the bilabial and
apico-dental consonants are found in the §§ 1 to 6, we here give some22THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEminimal pairs, showing the opposition between k and the other consonants and zero:pripteme13kety - I am repeatedly throwing here
ko - you
ka13 - emaciated
keki - raw
takucib - portion
kib - beat
k013 - put

13a13 - open (mouth)
rek£ - ginger
taruab - morning star
sib - place
so13 - mosquito
heni - ill
hrym - friend
uab - crawfish
iciy - uncle, aunt8. g.g is a voiced dorso-velar stop which is very much limited in its
combinabilirty with other phonemes. It is a bit fronted, if it is immediately followed by e or i, e.g. 13gesim - roll up, be13gib - sea.
g only occurs
word-medially, preceded by 13 or - less frequently - by m, e.g.
13gm - fall, bC1'Jga1'j - wasp, damg6u - yawn.
word-initially in ge which never occurs sentence-initially and also
otherwise is limited in its possibilities of occurrence (see Ch. VIII,
§ 3).
The result of this limited occurrence of g is that minimal pairs,
showing the opposition between g and any other consonant, are of
extreme rarity. Instances of contrast in similar environment are more
easily found, e.g. ne13ki - his wife, be1'jgib - sea. An instance of opposition
with zero is 13ga13 - construct (a wall), vs. 13a13 - open (mouth).
Yet there is no reason for the assumption that g is not a separate
phoneme, for it does not occur in complementary distribution to any
other speech sound and is not interchangeable with any other speechsound. This last statement seems to be contradictory to the fact that
some verb-forms occur with k as well as with g without any difference
15For a difficulty with such cases of opposition between k and g in verb-forms,
see § 8.","[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"

"In respect to their relations with productive categories, the improductive ones fall into two groups: those which have the same categorial
meaning as a productive category, and those whose categorial meaning
is not found with any productive category. Members of improductive
categories of the first kind prevent a speaker from using the corresponding forms of the productive category with the same categorial
meaning or limit the use of such forms (in case of competition).
Therefore, we call them b I 0 c k a din g categories. The improductive
categories of the second group do not limit the extension of the
productive ones at all. They constitute, as it were, excrescences on
the edge of the morphological system. We call them add i t ion a I
categories.
In the Nimboran verb-system a number of improductive categories
of both kinds are found. The blockading categories will be discussed
first, arranged under the headings of the categories which they
blockade. After this the additional categories will pass under separate
revIew.
2. Blockading categories of the Unspecified Object.
A. The cate'gory of the Apophonic seriesof Actor morphemes.
The members of this category have the same form as those of the
productive series, except for having Actor morphemes of the Apophonic
series and that form of the other morphemes that goes with such Actor124THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEmorphemes. In this category - like in all categories having Actor
morphemes of the Apophonic series - there is no formal opposition
between the Seventh and Eighth or between the Fourteenth and
Sixteenth Position categories.
Members of this category are forms with the root-morphemes:ki13- - gaze (ki13- also in Singular forms);
kyt3- - stoop down (ky1'3- also in Singular forms);
tety- - fall off (tety- also in Singular forms); for this root-morpheme
the Fifteenth Position category is blockaded by another category
(see § 14);
13gy1'3- - fall (13g}'13- also in Singular forms);
hri- - descend;
kOhJ- - emaciate;
u13guo- and 13guo- - appear together;
yy- - rise together;
iapo13 - bathe; with this root-morpheme only forms for the Plural
and the First
Second and Second Person Dual, with plural
meaning only, are found; for all the other forms there is suppletion of forms with root-morphemes ia- or i-;
kri- - flee (kri- also in Singular forms); with this root-morpheme
only Singular and Dual forms are found; for the Plural there
is substitution of forms with root-morpheme kry-;
reb- - drink; the Plural forms are blocked by the -de- category (see
below under f.);
uu- - answer; with this root-morpheme only Momentary forms of
this category are found, the Iterative being blocked by the -mefjcategory (see under B.);

Person Neutral forms of the First Position category are found
with the meaning ""it is (was, will be) ... "" for statements of
time, like seasons;
rci- - sleep; this root-morpheme has only Plural forms and First
Second and Second Person Dual forms, used only for plural
actors; for the Singular and Dual forms there is suppletion of
forms of the -ta- category with zero root-morpheme (see below
under K.);

"Members of this category are formally identical with those of the
-re13- category of the Unspecified Object (see § 2 under F.). Here
we find separate categories of Dual and Plural. This is in striking
contrast with the situation found in the Plural Object categories
discussed sofar in this § and in the productive Plural Object category.
In the Momentary forms of the First Position category the element
-re1J- has an accent and the Plural forms of Future and Present may
have an i immediately preceding the Actor morpheme.
The members of this category are:
Momentary forms with the root-morphemes
ki13- - order,MORPHOLOGY149tratJ- - call,
ya- - seek;

forms with zero root-morpheme, having the lexical meaning ""dream
(of)""; the Plural forms have a prefixed i.

tratJkrembeki - you (plur., du.) called them above,
irentiy - we dream of them (here).

are forms with the Plural stem sii- (root-morpheme sie- - squeeze), e.g.",[167]
"PHONOLOGY15As the oppositions between 0 and i, e, a, and y were demonstrated
in the §§ 1 to 4, we here give only some instances of minimal pairs
showing ,the opposition between 0 and u and zero:

buo - hang out
iduo - kind of frog

yesterday.
u has a high open allophone, used - in all cases - by those speakers
who are in the habit of using the backed allophone of y (see § 4).
A word-final u which has no accent and is immediately preceded
by 0, is actualized as voiced back dorsa-velar stop [G] by a minority
of speakers,14 e.g. [speG] for sp6u - unloosen.
For examples for the opposition between u and other vowel-phonemes
the reader is referred to §§ 1 Ito S. The opposition between u and zero
is apparent from minimal pairs like the following:

"A morphological category may be productive or improductive. If a
category is improductive, new members can not normally be added,
and, consequently, its members can be enumerated.
Productive categories, however, have no fixed number of members;
they represent a procede that may be extended over ever more words.
Such productive procedes provide a speaker with the morphological
means for forming new words, no matter wether he has heard these
words being used by other speakers or not. Investigating the ways in
which this is performed is the main subject of descriptive morphology.s
