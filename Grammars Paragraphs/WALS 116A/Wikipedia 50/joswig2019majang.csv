"In this example of a yes-no question, the final word oltíːrL ‘fish (PL)’ has a H
on both syllables. This H again rises to 175 Hz, a frequency normally out of
range for regular high tones. This interrogative sentence tone is not onlySentence Tone101used for yes-no questions, but also for questions with interrogative pronouns,
which in Majang usually appear at the end of the clause and therefore are the
carrier of this sentence tone.","[106, 107]"
"V.7.3 Questions and focus
This section presents a short overview of questions and focus phenomena, as
far as they have been studied so far.
Majang contrastive focus is accomplished by the use of the contrastive pronouns (see section IV.3.1.1). Contrastive focus often entails a choice from
already known entities, which is why Dik (1989, p. 278) cautions against
equating focus with information new to the hearer. This is therefore a pragmatically different situation from new-information focus, as defined by
Thwing and Watters (1987, p. 101): “Focus: that information in an utterance
which the speaker believes, assumes or knows that the hearer does not share”.
Information questions are a widely accepted and applied test for new-infor mation focus (Van der Wal, 2016, p. 264ff), as the component in question is
assumed to be in focus. The expected answer provides confirmation or information, and as such is always new information (Dixon, 2012, p. 377). Studying questions can therefore be revealing about focus structure, because, as
Dik (1989, p. 280) points out, “if a language has special strategies for the
expression of focus constituents, these strategies will typically be also used
for question words.”
The Majang language, in spite of its VAP syntax, places information with
new-information focus at the end of the clause, and does so also with interrogative pronouns, which fill the slot of new information. The responses to
questions fill exactly the same slot as the question words that solicited them:
Example V.91: information packaging in questions and their responses
a) ɗàmíːL kɔ̀ tàːr woːɗ?
ɗàm-íːL
kɔ̀
tàːr
woːɗ
eat-AP.3S.DJ RECPST\CJ meat\SG.ABS who\SG.ERG
Who ate meat?108
108Here is an unexplained use of the detransitivized verb form in a question. This seems to be
in free variation with the plain verb form in example V.92. Possibly the use of the detransitivized form has to do with the use of an unspecified and therefore non-individuated object ,
which may then result in a less than fully transitive form of the verb.",[386]
"V.7.3.1 Polar questions
Polar questions seek confirmation or disavowal of a proposition (Dixon,
2012, p. 377). In Majang this does not have to be marked by any means
other than a rising sentence tone at the end of the question (see section
II.8.2). This interrogative sentence tone is in all examples only represented
by the question mark.",[388]
"This marker always comes at the end of a question, even, like here, following the SFT-clitic. It prevents the use of the interrogative sentence tone – no
sharp rise of the pitch is observed in any example involving this particle. It
often appears when the question is followed up immediately by another
question (which, in example V.97, uses the interrogative sentence tone):
Example V.97: question marker joː between questions

DEM-SG-SPV.7.3.2 Content questions
A content question contains an interrogative pronoun (Dixon, 2012, p. 400).
This simple definition is easily applied to Majang, where a number of interrogative pronouns have been identified. As seen in section III.2.2.4, these
interrogative pronouns do not comply with Greenberg’s (1966, p. 111)
prediction that VAP languages have their question words at the beginning of
the clause. In Majang they come invariably at the end, in the same slot where
material in information focus is placed, and they are affected by interrogative sentence tone (see section II.8.2).

"As can be seen in figure 11, this question marker does not prevent the marking of the polar question by sentence tone. The question marker is not obligatory for marking questions, but it seems to be used particularly when the
question is a complex sentence, and it marks the question as such already
near the beginning of the sentence.
A second question marker is joː, which seems to particularly stress the polarity of a question:Pragmatically Marked Structures385Example V.96: question marker joː

"This illustration is part of the following example V.95, where the polar
question ends in the low tone of kɛɗɔ̀m. Here, too, the sharp rise of the
interrogative sentence tone can be observed.
There is also the option to use a special question particle kíː in polar questions:

"III.2.2.4 Question particles and question words
Unseth (1986a, p. 97) pointed out that the Majang language violates Greenberg’s (1966, p. 111) 12th universal, which states that “if a language has dominant word order VSO in declarative sentences, it always puts interrogative words or phrases first in interrogative word questions […].”
This universal is indeed violated in Majang, as the interrogative pronouns
and question words are always found at the end. See section V.7.3.2 for the
use of these interrogative pronouns.

"Although this sentence has some morphological complications, such as the
use of a serial-verb construction to express an associated motion, and the usePragmatically Marked Structures375of the dative to express possession on a kinship noun, the sentence does not
deviate from the basic clause configuration. The verb is directly followed by
an absolutive noun phrase, and therefore none of the pragmatic markings
provided by the language are in evidence. The verb appears in the conjoint
form, indicating that the P is non-topical, and no sentence-final topicality
marker is placed. The constituent order is in compliance with the canonical
VAP of Majang.
Other pragmatically relevant features are also set to the default: the sentence
is affirmative, and therefore has no negative morphology. It is a declarative
sentence, therefore there is no question morphology or sentence tone involved, and also no imperative or jussive morphology is in evidence.
This section now presents the effects of any changes to this default pragmatic setting: markings for individual constituents as topical or focus, negation, questions, and imperatives with jussives.","[380, 381]"
"This example also features another pragmatic particle, the question marker
kíː, which is not necessary to create a question (the interrogative ɛk would
accomplish this on its own), but it reinforces the question to the hearer.
Both particles í *ː and ànɛ could alternatively be classified as interjections (see
next section), as they can serve as non-elliptic utterances on their own
(Ameka, 2006, p. 1).
The particle àná is used instead of the imperative/jussive particle ìn in order
to downplay the magnitude of the imposed task:

"Furthermore, example V.93c) shows a disjoint form preceding a constituent
which apparently is in a new-information focus position, as the response to a
content question47. If the conjoint form cannot be reliably encountered in
front of constituents with new-information focus, then focus is apparently
not what the conjoint form signals.48
My previous publication on the conjoint-disjoint distinction (Joswig, 2015)
asserted that the distinction was based purely on syntactic parameters (p.
175). But this was written before I fully understood the importance of topicality in Majang. Assuming topicality as the starting point of the conjointdisjoint distinction in Majang, as envisioned by Van der Wal (2011, p.
1735), would render the language much more similar to the state of affairs in
Tswana, as described by Creissels (2012, p. 18), which also has a super47For a discussion of wh-questions as diagnostics for new-information focus, and some
caveats, see Van der Wal (2016, p. 264ff).
48
Van der Wal (p.c.) points toward a possibility how conjoint and focus may still be indirect ly related in Majang; the assumption would be that verb phrases are marked as conjoint
when the adjoining NP is counted as being inside the VP constituent – this would only ever
happen to absolutive NPs, but only when they refer to unexpected or new, that is, focal entities. Question words in Majang are apparently outside their linear order in the clause (see
section III.2.2.4), and therefore also outside the VP constituency, which would explain the
disjoint marking preceding focal material. The same would have to be assumed for disjoint
marking preceding NPs denoting responses to questions, such as in example V.93c).",[141]
"In both cases, the two questions do not differ in their order of constituents or
in any other morphological way from their affirmative counterparts. The
only difference is a sharply rising sentence tone at the end of the clause, as in
the following (stereo) pitch curve of example a):Figure 10: pitch drawing of máL kɔ̀ːL èːt mó?",[389]
"Both clauses b) and c) are responses to question a). In b), the response lacks
the SFT-clitic, and follows the conjoint marking on the verb phrase. In
example c), the response has a disjoint verb phrase, and comes with an SFTclitic. So once more topical constituent and focus are combined in the same
noun phrase. If the conjoint marking were to indicate focus on a following
noun phrase, then example c) should also have a conjoint VP. Therefore it
can be deduced that the conjoint rather indicates the presence of a nontopical NP than the presence of a focal NP (see section III.3 and footnote 48
for an extended discussion of this question).",[388]
"The pitch on the final high-toned word mó starts out moderately higher than
the preceding low tone on èːt, which is what is expected because of automatic downstep. But then it rises sharply up to the level of the initial high
tone on máL at the beginning of the clause. This is the effect of the polarquestion sentence tone. This can also be observed on polar questions ending
in a low tone, as in the following example:384Chapter V.7Figure 11: Pitch drawing of nɛ kój cɛ*ːn mɛlɛ cɛːgà kɛɗɔ̀m?","[389, 390]"
"Example a) shows woːɗ in the dative case. It is reinforced and modified by
the contrastive pronoun, which forms an NP together with the interrogative
pronoun. As a whole, the NP still stands at the end of the clause. Example b)
shows the interrogative woːɗ in its central-case plural form. This example
also displays another mysterious use of the detransitivized form of the verb
which appears to be frequently used in content questions (see footnote 108
and example V.102). Semantically, these clauses are not intransitive at all;
the P of ‘have’ is left-dislocated to a position preceding the clause. In example V.102 the P is found in its rightful place following the verb.",[392]
"IV.3.8.1 Pragmatic particles
Pragmatic particles are used by the speaker to interact with other speech-act
participants. The following is a list of pragmatic particles identified in
Majang.
In Majang agreement is expressed with the affirmative particle ǐː.
Example IV.289: affirmative particle ǐː
ǐː líkí mɛlɛ cìnɛːŋ.
ǐː
líkí
mɛl-ɛ
cì-n-ɛ=ŋ
yes correct arrive-3S.DJ DEM-SG-HR=SFT
Yes, right, that is clear.",[328]
"Usually, interrogative pronouns in Majang are placed at the end of the question clause. This cleft construction is the only way to get the interrogative
out of its clause-final position, with the effect of adding additional focus to
the interrogative pronoun. As the clefted constituent is now an interrogative
pronoun and not a demonstrative, the copula ègè is not used here.",[383]
"Both examples, taken out of natural texts, take a nominative subject with the
same verb tònú. In example a) this subject is fronted, but in example b) it follows the verb. Apart from such speech verbs, no other transitive verbs not
fronting a nominative subject were found. This may be seen as an indication
that speech verbs are treated inherently as intransitive verbs in Majang.
Another exception to the rule that a nominative A cannot appear post-verbally is example V.125, where this happens in a causal adverbial clause. Possibly there is more flexibility in subordinate clauses.
The following examples give the impression that a P (therefore in the absolutive case) can also be found in the preposed position:
Example V.22: left-dislocation of P
a) mɛlɛ kɔ̀ːníjɔ̀nL cɛːŋ. kɔ̀ːníjɔ̀nL cɛ, làkíːL ètéŋL bàŋɛ.

ɟàrtí
náːk
ɗàm
kɔ̀
ɟìkónt
woman\SG.ABS POSS\1S.SG.ABS eat\3S.DJ RECPST what\ERG
My woman, what ate her?",[347]
"Example b) shows the subject noun tɔ̀nL ‘child’ to be in new-information focus, as it is in the last position of the clause, following the object, and as a
topical constituent, because it is marked by the nominative case and followed by a modifier with the SFT-marker. The language consultants agree
that both clauses V.91b) and V.92b) cannot invert the order of subject and
object to the canonical order. This is very instructive for the interpretation of
central cases in Majang. If one were to pursue the analysis that the difference
between ergative and nominative was not grounded in topicality, but in focality, then all ergative occurrences would have to be explained as focused
constituents of a clause. The situation here now suggests that any constituent
in new-information focus appears at the end of a clause. But this is not the
place where ergative constituents are usually found. This implies that there is
an inherent difference between focus and ergative, which is confirmed by the
fact that when focus and topical constituent go together, as in example
V.92b), the nominative case is chosen.
The same can be tested for the P of a transitive clause. The response to a
question for the P can follow both a disjoint and a conjoint verb, and it can382Chapter V.7come with and without a sentence-final topicality marker. Again, all responses need to be interpreted as having a P in information focus.
Example V.93: question and response with topical and non-topical P in focus
a) ɗàm kɔ̀ dɔ̀mɔ̀ːn ɟíkon?
ɗàm
kɔ̀
dɔ̀mɔ̀ːn

"381tɔ̀n
child\SG.ERGExample b) shows the A noun phrase, marked by the ergative case, as the
last element of the clause, even following the object. This pragmatically
marked structure is the only environment in which the order of subject and
object can be reversed in the language. This is also the case for an A marked
by the nominative case:
Example V.92: question and response with nominative A
a) ɗàm kɔ̀ tàːr woːɗ?

I want to thank the following people for their contribution to this study:
The main language consultant for this study was Joseph Kalakun. In many of
the research sessions Joseph was supported by his colleagues of the Majang
Bible Translation Project, Hawariyat Babure, Epheson Teramaj, and, until
2011, Abyot Girma. This was graciously permitted by the Illubabor Bethel
Synod of the EECMY. James Kim and Gallo Aylate helped setting up the research sessions. Furthermore, James and his wife Whashu shared their
knowledge and material on the Majang language.
Other Majang speakers contributing to this work were Yordanos Addisu,
Kadiree Nyamor, Nibeyat Dimesse, and Ashine Astin.
Tyler Schnoebelen generously shared his personally collected Majang Data
with me. Sandra Hufnagel transcribed most words of the Comparative African Word List, initially supported by Stefanie Hauser.
Pete Unseth shared more data and analysis with me. He once intended to
write this very language description, and I am glad that he entrusted me with
completing this work.
I am grateful to Drs. Moges Yigezu and Getachew Anteneh for the ideas and
inspiration we shared with each other while working on the same language.
I benefited from practical help by various friends and colleagues. David Ford
spent hours editing sound files, and even more on proofreading. Seyoum
Berhe translated materials from Amharic to English. Tefera Endalew provided logistical help in Mizan Teferi. Other workers of the Bench-Maji MLE
project, particularly Efrem Belay, helped me immensely in later stages.
My doctoral supervisor Maarten Mous and co-promoter Constance KutschLojenga gave good feedback on all parts of this study, and more came from
the committee members Gerrit Dimmendaal, Doris Payne, Jenneke van der
Wal and Maarten Kossmann. Further conversations I had with Mary Pearce,
Keith Snider, Helga Schröder, Colleen Ahland, Michael Ahland, Mike
Bryant, Joshua Smolders, Anne-Christie Hellenthal, Don Killian, Manuel
Otero, Mike Cahill, Roger Blench, and Tom Payne. More occasional advice
was given by numerous participants on the SIL Linguistics Discussion List.
Colin Davis created the language map on page 37. Anne-Christie Hellenthal
provided the Dutch Samenvatting at the end of this book.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"328Chapter IV.3329Part V: Other Syntactic and Pragmatic Topics
This part of the language description deals with the use of the various forms
explored in the previous sections, focusing on what they accomplish mostly
from a functional perspective. Section V.1 investigates the structure of the
noun phrase, and section V.2 does the same for verb phrases. In section V.3,
the structure of the various kinds of simple clauses is presented, and section
V.4 surveys the semantic functions of various noun phrases. Sections V.5 to
V.6 briefly deal with further syntactic topics (valence-changing constructions and tense, aspect and mode). Section V.7 lists a number of pragmatically marked structures, such as fronting, negation, questions, focus and imperatives. Section V.8 investigates the various ways to combine clauses to complex sentences, and section V.9 addresses topics relating to topical continuity
and discontinuity.","[333, 334, 335]"
"I.11 Typological Overview
This section contains an overview of the basic typological facts about Majang for easy reference. The details of all these features should be read in
their respective passages in this language description.
Compared with other Surmic languages, Majang has a very small consonant
inventory with only 18 consonants, including two implosives /ɓ, ɗ/ (see sec-48Chapter I.11tion II.2.1). The language provides no systematic opposition between stops,
fricatives and affricates – all these sounds can be subsumed under the single
label obstruents.
Majang has seven vowels (including two sets of mid vowels, see section
II.1.1), without ATR vowel harmony (section II.1.4). There is contrast between short and long vowels (section II.1.3). Important phonological rules of
Majang are labial harmony, which rounds the short vowel /i/ to /ù/ in verbal
suffixes following syllables containing round vowels or labial consonants,
and the morphologically restricted vowel-height harmony, which changes
the vowel /ɛ/ into /e/ following a high-vowel syllable (section II.5).
The tonal inventory consists of two tones plus downstep (section II.6). It can
be shown that some morphemes in Majang are inherently toneless, and that
another morpheme requires an analysis involving a polar tone. Many words
demonstrably end in a floating low tone (section II.6.3), which is often attached to apparently toneless morphemes. Tone plays an extensive role, not
only in distinguishing lexical items, but also in the grammar of Majang.
The Majang morphology is predominantly agglutinative, with segmental affixes containing individual bits of grammatical information (only suffixes
are productive, with two unproductive prefixes). Some grammatical features,
however, such as noun number and case, are indicated by stem changes or by
tonal means. Like most Eastern-Sudanic languages, Majang does not display
grammatical gender, but it provides a very diverse number- and case-marking system on nouns, with a large number of inflection classes (section
IV.1.3). Case marking is complicated by the provision of special forms for
modified nouns in some syntactic cases (section IV.1.3.2). Unlike other Surmic languages, Majang has no distinction between inclusive and exclusive
forms of the first person plural of pronouns or verbs.
The language has a variety of personal pronouns for various functions. One
set of pronouns serves for general anaphoric reference, another for reference
inside the verb phrase, and a third for contrastive purposes (section
IV.3.1.1). Demonstratives and relative pronouns code a three-level deictic
system, with reference to either the speaker, the hearer, or a place away from
them both (sections IV.3.1.2, IV.3.1.3). Possessive pronouns indicate the
person of the possessor together with number reference to the possessed
entity (section IV.3.1.4). Interrogative pronouns always appear at the end of
the question.","[53, 54]"
"This sentence is from a conversation about different orthography standards.
The relative clause refers to the previous orthography system without bringing it up as a head noun.
The use of the relative pronoun allows the Majang language great flexibility
regarding the question of what kind of NPs can be relativized (Keenan,
1985, p. 155). Example V.139a) relativizes a non-topical S. The relative
clause in example V.139b) refers to the P and c) to the topical S of a verbless
clause. Example V.141 has the headless relative clause referring to an adverbial constituent in the locative case. As one would expect, the A can also
be relativized:

"II.1.3 Vowel length
Vowel length plays an important role in Majang. This is typologically quite
different from the Southeast-Surmic languages, which seem to make use of
vowel length only sparingly; in both Mursi and Suri, the few long vowels are
attributed to the loss of intervocalic consonants (Bryant, 2013, p. 28f; Mütze,
2014, p. 39f). The distinction between long and short vowels cannot be analyzed in these terms in Majang. It is frequently used and lexically
contrastive, as can be easily confirmed by numerous minimal pairs:
Example II.2: short and long vowels

b) olàn

"In example a), Leer’s mother had been mentioned in the preceding context,
but is in this clause encountered after a change of place and time, and accordingly is not an expected participant. The thus non-topical P therefore
triggers the conjoint marking (see section III.3) on the immediately preceding verb (example III.14a). Topical PS also come in the absolutive case, but
don’t meet the condition for conjoint marking on the preceding verb; instead
they create the condition that allows the placement of the SFT-clitic (see section III.4) on the NP at the end of a sentence (example b). This clause follows clause a) after a short time in the same narrative.
It can therefore be observed that in Majang the discourse-pragmatic factor of
topicality accounts for a change of case for A and S, but it leaves the case of
P intact. The topicality of P is shown by other means.
Because it was shown for other languages that it is rather the discourse-pragmatic factor of focus or focality that prompts the assignment of the ergative
case to otherwise unmarked NPs, it needs to be shown here why this analysis
has been discarded for Majang in favor of the assignment of the nominative
case for topical constituents – the non-elicited NPs with ergative case in examples III.9b) and III.10) could indeed be seen as focal in their pragmatic
contexts. Two reasons speak against the idea of ergative marking for focal
constituents: first, the ergative-marked NP in example III.9a) plus practically
all elicited examples of ergative case provide no contextual evidence that
any focality attaches to the NP in question 38. Indeed, the fact that all elicited
transitive clauses have A marked by the ergative makes any analysis of the
ergative case as the focal case very unlikely – there is no reason to assume
that in every elicited transitive clause each A defaults to focus marking. It
would be more natural to expect focally unmarked As in elicited clauses.
38See section VI.1.2 for the context of example III.9a).",[127]
"As seen in these examples, transitive clauses can come in various configurations, depending on the factors explored in section V.3.1 and particularly in
Part III: Basic Syntax. Example a) has an ergative-absolutive configuration,
whereas the other examples either have no overt A (c and e), or the A is in
the nominative. The A is preposed in examples b) and d), and the P is leftdislocated in example e). Example c), with the verb phrase immediately followed by the absolutive P, has a conjoint form, whereas the other examples
use disjoint forms. What all these examples have in common is that there is
always an overt P in the absolutive case (or the clause would not be transitive), and that an A, if overtly present, always precedes the P (see section
V.7.3 for exceptions to this based on focality). Other clause constituents,
such as the dative-allative noun in example c), always follow both A and P.
The complex case system of Majang, influenced by the factor of topicality,
leads to the question of whether bivalent constructions are all equally transitive, or some are more transitive than others. They are certainly coded in different ways. When a nominally transitive action is seen as non-telic or nonpunctual, a plain verb is turned into a derived imperfective verb stem. These
in turn tend to have a non-individuated object, which is easily left out
through the antipassive derivation:

"In these examples, the A of the transitive clause is marked by the ergative
case, as evidenced by the HL sequence on the last syllable of the proper
name in example a), and by the special ergative form of the interrogative
pronoun (see p. 387 for the other case forms of this pronoun) in example b).
In example a), the ergative is chosen for a main participant following a reset
of time and place, and with a different subject than in the previous clause. In
example b) the ergative is used for a question word asking for an unknown
subject; the object of this clause is left-dislocated (see section V.7.1.2) to a
position outside the clause. A less clear example shows an NP in the ambiguous form that is identical for both the modified nominative and the
modified ergative:114Chapter III.2Example III.10: textual example with ergative case assumed by word order

position following the verb, where in clear textual examples nominative ANPs were never encountered (see section III.2.2.1).
These rare examples taken from natural discourse are balanced by countless
examples from elicitation, using questionnaires with context-free example
sentences, where practically every transitive clause yields an ergative-absolutive pattern, illustrated in the following clauses:

man\SG.ABSUndoubtedly these examples are unnatural in the sense that it is very difficult to find them in narrative discourse. The factor of preferred argument
structure, as proposed by Du Bois (1987, 2003), in combination with the tendency of Majang to avoid free pronouns for subjects, explains the very low
frequency of ergative-marked noun phrases in natural texts. Preferred argument structure discourages the use of a full NP as an A argument. An NP thatCase Marking on Central Constituents115is not there cannot be marked for ergative, which renders the ergative case
invisible in a language that only ever marks it on an NP.
Still, it would be unwise to discount the information gleaned from such examples on the basis that they do not come from narrative texts. It remains a
fact that when a Majang speaker is asked to produce a transitive sentence,
without fail s/he first comes up with an ergative-absolutive case pattern in a
VAP clause. This alignment system therefore represents a deeply ingrained
grammatical structure that probably sees prominent use in everyday natural
discourse, but not in the kind of structured texts that linguists tend to analyze
for writing their grammars. The observer is faced with the notion that “when
a departure from Preferred Argument Structure does occur in natural discourse, the resulting utterance bears not a hint of ungrammaticality” (Du
Bois, 2003, p. 78). After all, “Preferred Argument Structure cannot be reduced to a grammatical rule. It must remain within the domain of discourse,
as a patterning of grammar with consequences for grammar” (ibid).
Now it still needs to be asked where exactly in natural discourse the ergative-absolutive alignment system thrives to the point that it appears as the
grammatical system of choice in almost all elicited transitive clauses; if no
one ever uses it in any speech situation at all, this alignment system would
be quickly forgotten by the grammar. Looking outside the narrative genre, in
my case, did not provide the answer: one text of my corpus is a planning
conversation between three speakers with well over 150 clauses, and still the
ergative case does not feature in this at all. The same is true for a short hortatory text. It therefore remains a rewarding task for future research 32 to determine the segments or genres of Majang natural discourse that freely admit
the use of ergative-absolutive systems. My hypothesis is that they must exist,
and that I just have not found them.
As for the alternative to this ergative-absolutive alignment system: as stated
above, the main reason why it is almost impossible to see ergative-marked
NPs is preferred argument structure. But even an existing A-NP is usually
32Watters (2018, p. 394ff) conducted such research for the Tibeto-Burman language Dzongkha, comparing the impact of genre on competing case-marking patters. For that language,
Watters concluded that “grammatical relations in Dzongkha is found to range from a splitergative system to a pragmatic system, whereby the manifestation of one marking pattern
over another is probabalistically dependent on and functionally motivated by genre.” The
exact findings, however, are very different from the situation in Majang, showing a higher
probability for ergative-marked As in monologic texts.","[119, 120, 121]"
"V.5.1 Antipassive construction
The antipassive is the syntactic-pragmatic counterpart to the impersonal
form (see section IV.2.3.1), as both create semantically intransitive clauses
out of transitive verbs. While the impersonal form is used for backgrounding
a non-topical A, the antipassive is used for backgrounding a non-topical P
(Givón, 1990, p. 624). Ergative languages which also display syntactic ergativity, such as verb agreement with the P, would additionally have a need for
an antipassive construction to make an A available for equi-NP deletion
(Anderson, 1976, p. 17), but this is clearly not a need for Majang, which displays no syntactic ergativity.
The presence of antipassive structures was observed by Schröder (2006) as
characteristic for Nilotic and Surmic languages. That Majang has an antipassive construction was already addressed (with insufficient detail) by myself
(Joswig, 2016). More details about the form of antipassive markers in
Majang are found in section IV.2.2.2, where it is called detransitivization
derivation. By comparing the antipassive form with the impersonal form, it360Chapter V.5can be noted that the antipassive marking appears to be closer to the verb
root, and that it takes further person marking. For this reason it is treated in
section IV.2.2.2 as a derivation, whereas the impersonal marker fills the person slot of a verb with a dedicated impersonal formative, and is treated as inflection in section IV.2.3.1. This forces the conclusion that the antipassive is
structurally unrelated to the impersonal form.
The antipassive, as stated above, entirely removes a non-topical P from the
proposition. In Majang it is not possible to state an object in an antipassive

"Unmarked singular nouns
Most nouns in the sample (at least 630) leave the singular completely unmarked. About 125 of these have a floating low tone following the absolutive-singular noun stem. The only effect of this is a lowering of the register
of the next word. The following example shows unmarked singular nouns (ac) and singulars followed by a floating L (d-f); the possessive pronoun nàːk
‘my’ with its high tone is used as a diagnostic device to show the resulting
downstep.
Example IV.5: nouns with and without floating L in the singular
a) áːbɛ nàːk
b) màcàrɛ nàːk
c) ùɗéː nàːkmy fig tree
my fence
my pestled) tɛpɛnL nàːk
e) ɛtɛɗL nàːk
f) ùtúlL nàːkmy forehead
my honey
my holeOne could attempt to identify this floating low tone as a marker for the absolutive singular for those nouns that have it. But it can be seen in the following sections that in Majang the various stems of the same noun can be very
different from each other, including the presence and absence of floating Ls.
It is therefore not helpful to try to distinguish between nouns that just happenNouns151to end in a floating L and those which may use it as a marker for the absolutive singular. In what follows, it is assumed that a floating L is always a stem
feature. For some nouns it can be shown that this floating low tone may have
an effect observable in other stems. For example, regarding the noun dúːdùrL
‘dust’, it can be shown that the floating L in the singular stem has a noticeable effect on the number suffix of the plural form dúːdùrɛ (see example
IV.24 for details). For other nouns, such effects cannot be observed, so for
these cases it is assumed that the floating L is just a feature of the absolutive
singular stem.
The nouns with unmarked singular can have quite different case-marking
strategies, as the following case paradigms of unmarked singular nouns may
illustrate:

ɟàrtíonkNot many generalizations about the case marking of unmarked singular
nouns are possible. The ergative has low tones on short vowels and HL sequences on long vowels. But whether the vowel in question is long or short
cannot be reliably predicted from looking at the absolutive stem. The modified ergative/nominative form almost always has a high tone followed by a
floating L, but even to this generalization there are exceptions like cúwoj.
The plain nominative form often has a floating L, but that, too, can be unpredictably absent. The dative sometimes has a L, and sometimes a H, which is
sometimes followed by a floating L and sometimes not. The locative can be
formed by -è or -ɛ or some idiosyncratic stem change involving length and
tone. Those locatives without a suffix also provide a modified locative form
which is different from the plain locative. The possessive usually has a tonal
variant of the suffix -onk, but is sometimes also expressed by the alternative
suffix -k. Additionally, there are stem changes, as for ‘heart’, or even suppletion on nouns like ‘man’. But these are infrequent.","[156, 157]"
"134Chapter III.3The terminology of conjoint and disjoint is taken from Bantu linguistics45,
where similar distinctions46 are found in a number of Eastern Bantu languages. Creissels (2012, p. 1) describes this distinction as follows:
“[…] a conjoint verb form is a verb form that cannot be found
in sentence final position, and cannot be separated from the following phrase by a pause. A disjoint verb form is a form that
does not have this limitation, but is not excluded from non-final
contexts either, and a disjoint verb form in non-final position is
not necessarily separated from the following word by a perceptible pause.”
This description defines conjoint and disjoint in entirely structural terms,
and, as it stands, describes the behavior of the conjoint and disjoint forms in
Majang quite accurately, which is why this terminology is adopted here for a
Nilo-Saharan language. As far as I know, the terms conjoint and disjoint
were not applied previously for languages displaying ergative-absolutive
structures – this makes it necessary to use caution while applying the terms
in the Majang context with its very different syntactic and pragmatic environment compared to Bantu languages.
When it comes to the function of conjoint and disjoint forms, there are at
least some Bantu languages where the definition of conjoint and disjoint remains on the structural level (Van der Wal, 2011, p. 1735). But even for
those, van der Wal asserts that “there are pragmatic effects attached to the
choice for the one or the other verb form, where the element following the
conjoint form is non-topical and may be focal [...]” (ibid.).
Van der Wal’s (2017, p. 15) most recent definition of the conjoint-disjoint
distinction is even more explicit in the inclusion of information structure as a
defining criterion:
“The conjoint/disjoint alternation is an alternation between
verb forms that are formally distinguishable, that are associ45Besides the Surmic languages indicated by Dimmendaal, conjoint-disjoint distinctions outside the Bantu family were also reported for Adamawan Doyayo (Elders, 2006) and the Gur
language Yom (Fiedler, 2017).
46
The situation in Majang does not fit the defining characteristics of metatony, as summarized by Hyman (2017, p. 108). Metatony in Bantu happens whenever the verb in question is followed by an object. But this is not the case in Majang, where the presence of an
object in itself is not sufficient to trigger the tonal difference.","[139, 140]"

"Semantics of tense markers
Only five different tense markers were found to follow the verb as part of the
verb phrase: ɓàL ‘remote past (REMPST)’, kànL ‘medium past (MEDPST)’, kɔ̀ ‘recent past (RECPST)’, kɔ̀ːL ‘near future (NFUT)’ and koj ‘distant future (DFUT)’.
Bender (1983, p. 133) listed three more markers (kɔ̀ːt, ɓòŋ and ɗi), but he
could not provide good evidence for their use, nor were they encountered in
my data. Getachew (2014, p. 159ff) and Unseth (2007, p. 628) both restricted their inventory to the five markers listed here, so there is good agreement
that they belong to a closed class. Their glosses were taken from Bender’s,
Unseth’s and Getachew’s descriptions, and they served well for analyzing
the text corpus for this study. Tense in Majang therefore appears to be
metrical, in the sense that the time around the temporal reference point (the
time of the utterance) is divided up into somewhat unspecific domains of increasing distance to the reference point. When I asked my consultants about
what the individual markers are used for, they came up with specific time
frames, like “several years ago” for ɓàL, “a few days ago at most” for kɔ̀,Other Word Classes311etc. The fact that Majang provides more past markers than future tense markers is quite in line with descriptions of metrical tense in other languages
(Chung & Timberlake, 1985, p. 209).
Still, from looking at the examples in the texts, this neat metrical categorization of tense appears to be doubtful. For example in the story of Dog and
Donkey (see p. 415), the tense marker ɓàL is used throughout the story for referring to main-line actions. Then, following the climax, where Dog unexpectedly kills Hyena, the narrative switches to the tense marker kànL (which,
interestingly, was called narrative past by Bender, although it is not used
much elsewhere within my text collection). There is no reason to assume that
from this point in the narrative the reported events are significantly closer to
the time of the telling of the story; therefore it is very likely that the marker
L
kàn serves some other purpose than just being a medium-past marker.
In the same way, the two future-tense markers may be less characterized by
a difference in temporal distance than in probability. Of the 16 examples
found in my texts using the tense marker kój, almost every single one is used
either in a question or in a purpose clause:

"Other verbal conjugations for stative verbs
Majang stative verbs were almost always encountered in simple paradigms,
involving neither directional nor subordinate verb form markings. But this
tendency does not amount to an exclusion. One example was found in the
text corpus in which a stative verb is used both in the centripetal form and in
the relative-past subordinate form:Verbs283Example IV.206: complex stative-verb form

The following is an alphabetic list of all bound morphemes of the Majang
language, as encountered in this work. V in a prefix stands for the first stem
vowel in a total vowel harmony context. In a suffix it refers to the class vowel of the verb (à, ɛ, or i). The following tonal conventions are used to refer to
the underlying tone of the morpheme:
•-i (no tone indicated): a toneless morpheme – the morpheme copies
the previous tone.","[19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"
"IV.3.5 Auxiliaries
There are not many auxiliaries in the Majang language. Auxiliaries are
lexically empty verbs whose purpose is to provide the grammatical
information needed for another verb that comes in a reduced grammatical
shape, but that provides the semantic content to the proposition (T. Payne,
1997, p. 84).
The morpheme that fits this definition best is the negative auxiliary k- that is
needed to precede the negative verb forms introduced in section IV.2.2.1.
Whereas the negative verb form is unchanged for all persons, the subject
information is provided by the negative auxiliary.
The negative auxiliary, just like verbs, has different endings for the 1 st, 2nd
and 3rd person in the singular and plural:314Chapter IV.3Example IV.268: conjugation of the negative auxiliary
1S kà pàːkkà
2S kín pàːkkà
3S kí pàːkkà

2P kí *ːr pàːkkà
3P kír pàːkkàI am not hot
you are not hot
it is not hot
we are not hot
you are not hot

SGPLUnseth (1989a, p. 119) recorded the negative marker as kù-, which is probably a dialectal variation that I did not encounter during my data collection.
Getachew (2014, p. 177ff) seems to have recorded the negative marker without the vowel /ù/.
The negative auxiliary can undergo further inflection than just the bare person suffixes seen above. It can appear with the impersonal marker:
Example IV.269: impersonal negative auxiliary

"IV.1.3 Inflectional processes
As indicated in section IV.1.1, nouns can be inflected for number and case.
In line with other Surmic languages, the Majang language does not make any
grammatical gender distinctions.
The noun template (see example IV.1) states that maximally two inflection
suffixes can be used on the noun. These two slots are conveniently called
number and case. But there are various reasons why the two grammatical
features number and case cannot be treated separately from each other. As
stated above, some nouns have their number and case marked entirely without filling these slots. Other configurations fill only one slot, and the morpheme filling it provides information on both number and case. As an example, the noun bɔ̀ːlɔ̀ŋL ‘old man (ABS.SG)’ forms the absolutive plural as
L
L
bɔ̀ːlɔ̀ŋeːr and the modified ergative plural as bɔ̀ːlɔ̀ŋer . The locative plural is
L
formed as bɔ̀ːlɔ̀ŋeːrɛ . The locative and absolutive plural use the long-vowelled suffix -eːrL and the ergative the short-vowelled suffix -erL. The fact that
the locative form still needs to add the locative marker -ɛL in the case slot of
the noun makes it clear that the two markers -erL and -eːrL have to be seen as
filling the number slot, although they also contain implicit case information.
The difference in vowel length of the number marker is the difference responsible for the case differentiation between absolutive and ergative.
To account for this portmanteau behavior of the number and case markers,
and for the fact that many nouns use stem differences for their inflectional
categories, this section first introduces the various ways in which number
can be marked, and next the ways in which case can be marked. But already
in the section dealing with number marking, paradigms are provided that
show the case-marking variations of a particular number-marker allomorph.
IV.1.3.1 Number marking
Majang distinguishes between singular and plural. All elements of the noun
phrase show number agreement with the head noun, and subject marking onNouns149the verb also agrees with the number of the referenced entity. Number marking was treated by Bender (1983, pp. 124–127) and in more detail by Unseth
(1988b). These works are generally adequate, but because of their lack of
tone marking they missed some morphological distinctions. Getachew
(2014, p. 94ff) filled some of these gaps by providing information on the role
of tone in number marking. All three previous approaches are similar to each
other in separating the issue of number marking from case marking. It is
shown in section IV.1.3.2 that such a treatment cannot do justice to the
morphological processes operating on Majang nouns; therefore I provide paradigms of case marking together with number-marking allomorphs. A complete picture of number-case combinations is presented in section IV.1.3.3.
A number-marking system as complex as the one encountered in Majang
opens up the question whether it can really be seen as an inflectional device.
One could alternatively consider treating it as a lexical process, possibly involving derivation devices that create different singular and plural stems, as
suggested by Hayward (1981, p. 128f) for Dirayta. I treat it as an inflectional
category, mostly in order to present it together with other inflectional categories such as case and modification, which often combine to portmanteau
formatives with the number markers. Furthermore, in spite of the multitude
of number formatives, particularly for the plural, some generalizations can
be made about how they are applied. The number of nouns with a numbermarking behavior that is not copied by at least one other noun is very small.
Furthermore, singular and plural marking generally come to predictable
meanings entirely centered around the dimension of grammatical number.
Number marking is obligatory in Majang – single referents require a singular
form, and multiple referents require a plural form. Almost every noun is
clearly identifiable for its number value. Most nouns have a singular root and
a marked plural, but for some it is the other way around. For a number of
nouns both forms are morphologically marked. Some nouns only come in
either a singular or a plural form, and for a few nouns number marking happens through suppletion. Majang therefore clearly exhibits the – according to
Dimmendaal (2000, p. 216) – prototypical number-marking characteristics
of a Nilo-Saharan language.
Which form of number marking is chosen for each noun seems to be mostly
a lexical decision. But, as Unseth (1988b, p. 79) points out, “some generalizations concerning various plural noun classes are noticeable. Some of the
plural classes are grouped by phonological criteria and others by semantic150Chapter IV.1criteria.” Such generalizations, however, are not more than tendencies, and
if such tendencies are observable for a particular marker, they are indicated
in the section dealing with this marker.
As a basis for all numerical information given in the sections below, 719
nouns were analyzed for their number-marking behavior.","[154, 155, 156]"
"Regular personal pronouns
Regular personal pronouns are inflected for person, number and case. As
shown below, for pronouns the language does not use the ergative-absolutive-nominative distinction seen elsewhere in the language. There is only one
unmarked set for A, S and P pronouns. The cases that are marked on personal pronouns beyond this basic set are dative and locative.
It is very difficult to obtain examples of A pronouns, both in the text corpus
or through elicitation. The only two instances of bivalent verbs with preposed A pronouns are seen here:

show a P constituent. The verb is more profitably interpreted as intransitive.
Possibly the antipassive marking is not used with loan words, as in this case.
Example b) semantically looks much more like a transitive clause, but it can
be seen in section V.3.1.2 that there are doubts about the transitivity of
clauses involving speech verbs. A subject pronoun of an indubitably transitive clause was not found in any of my texts. The following example a) is an
unsuccessful attempt to elicit an A pronoun into a transitive clause from a
natural text which came without this pronoun. The language consultants
agreed that this is not grammatical. To redeem it, one would have to choose
a contrastive pronoun (example b).",[290]
"In these clauses, the A is invariably marked by the nominative case and is
just as invariably preposed. Having an alternative AVP structure is not unexpected according to Greenberg’s prediction that “all languages with dominant VSO order have SVO as an alternative or as the only alternative basic
order” (Greenberg, 1966, p. 110). But Unseth was not able to confirm this
prediction based on elicitation (1989b, p. 109):
“Deliberate attempts to elicit other word orders by topicalization did not produce any variants. Some SVO clauses were occasionally elicited at other times, such as in subordinate
clauses […]. My Majang helper consistently rejected the SOV
[sic!]43 examples in Bender’s article [...].”
This experience is a strong indication that the VAP order of constituents has
a firm psychological standing in the mental grammar of Majang speakers.
Although the AVP order has a high functional load in the syntax of the
language for re-establishing accessible participants, it is not something the
speakers have a conscious awareness of. Therefore mother-tongue translators
will have to be trained in the pragmatic significance of this structure, so that
43This is a typo in Unseth (1989). Bender (1983, p. 128f) presents rather unnatural AVP
examples.",[135]
"But even this is freely exchangeable with the regular 2P form:

againIV.2.3.5 Referential-object forms
The same forms used for relative-past subordinate clauses can also be used
in main clauses. When this happens, they always attach to transitive verbs if
the object is an activated participant of the discourse and is therefore not
overtly mentioned. In other words, this referential-object form indicates that272Chapter IV.2the object of the proposition has just been talked about and therefore is not
shown in an overt NP. This is a very different situation from the detransitivizing/antipassive marking seen in section IV.2.2.2, which is used only
when the object has no topicality at all and therefore is not worth mentioning. The referential-object marking, instead, has the object not overtly
mentioned because it is topical and activated, and therefore needs no overt
reference. The referential-object marker is not an object suffix, providing a
clear reference to the object, but a marker indicating that the object of the
clause is an activated participant mentioned immediately before. The following example is taken out of a narrative, where the main character speaks
about the other main character:
Example IV.190: referential-object verb form
nɛ dɔ̀ːc, nòmɛːɗáL kɔ̀ːL rómíːɗ.
nɛ dɔ̀ːc nòm-ɛːɗ-àL
kɔ̀ːL rómíːɗ

Okay, I will follow her in the morning.","[277, 278]"
"If this example consisted just of a negative verb phrase, then one would expect the SFT-marker to be placed at the end of the sentence. But this can never
be done. Unseth (1989b, p. 111) therefore correctly assumes that the negative verb needs to be seen as a complement of the negative auxiliary. This
also fits its nature as a nominalization, which is quite often formally identical
to the infinitive.
Verbless predicates are negated by the use of a negative copula:
Example V.88: use of negative copula
mókò ìɟáːgL cìnɔ̀ kómój òmóŋL ŋɔ̀nk dákɛːɗà.

Work is not just of one kind.ŋɔ̀nk
SUBdákɛːɗà
onlyThis negative copula works like affirmative copulas in that it stays the same
for all persons; it is further specified by a regular personal pronoun:
Example V.89: use of negative copula
moko eːt àgàltL!
moko eːt àgàltL
COP\NEG 1S
thief\SG.ABS
I am not a thief!",[385]
"In this example, the auxiliary verb óːl ‘can’ is used in the negative form
L
óːlɛː . This needs to be preceded by the negative auxiliary k-, which is in this
context used in its 1S form kà. Negative verb forms cannot be used without
such a preceding negative auxiliary.
It appears that the negative verb formation is based on the formation of infinitives. For almost half of all the verbs in the sample, the form of the infinitive is identical in all respects to the negative form. This is particularly true
for most of the verbs forming their infinitive with the suffixes -ɛːt and -iːt.
All the verbs forming their infinitives with -iːt do the same for the negative
verb form. Of all the verbs forming their infinitive with -ɛːt, only nine do not
use this marker for the negative. One of these, with the infinitive làptɛːt ‘to
die’, uses the suffix -ànL for the negative làptànL. The other eight use the
suffix -iːt, which is regularly used for all ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs ending with the
detransitivizing marker -ɗiːL.

burnThe last two of these examples show high-toned base stems, which form
their infinitives regularly with -ɛːL. They, too, end their negative forms on
L
-iːt , which copies the root tone and is followed by a floating L. It is difficult
to determine whether this is the same suffix as the -iːt of i-class verbs, or another suffix -tL just used for the negative form. A suffix -tL is also used for
the six verbs using the durative stem extension -àː, such as rɔ̀ːríjàː ‘teach’, infinitive rɔ̀ːríjɔ̀nL, negative rɔ̀ːríjàːtL. Other high-toned negative -iːtL markers
are found on five a-class verbs, such as ɗegeger ‘agree’, infinitive ɗegeger,
negative ɗegegeríːt.
The verbs that form their infinitives with -ɛːL or -íːL (and that don’t pick the
same marker for the negative) have an almost identical negative form -ɛːɗVerbs221(38 ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs) or -íːɗ (20 i-class verbs); the implosive is only dropped in
the absolutive form of the infinitive. If the implosive is not dropped, then the
final H is realized as a HL sequence. In any case, all other tones on the stem
are replaced by a H that spreads across the whole word.

trapIn the same way, the suffix set -ànL/-ɔ̀nL is not only used for the infinitive,
but also for negative verbs, although in smaller numbers than the previously
mentioned suffixes. Only seven i-class verbs use it for the negative, whereas
the other eleven i-class verbs which use -ànL for the infinitive instead use -ɛːL
for the negative. Another 16 ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs use -ànL for both the infinitive and
the negative, and 14 more use -ɛːL for the negative. In the a-class, six verbs
use -ànL and its tonal varieties for both the infinitive and the negative, and
seven more use -ɛːL for the negative instead of -ànL. Among these are some
low-toned manifestations of the marker -ɛːL.

The infinitive and the negative forms can be derived from practically all verb
stems, and they lead to verbal nouns which are used in certain grammatical
contexts. These are, according to Comrie and Thompson (1985, p. 350ff),
action/state nominalizations. But, beyond these two forms, there are other
ways to derive nouns from verbs with a more lexicalized meaning, called
argument nominalizations by Comrie and Thompson. They (1985, pp. 351–
357) sub-categorize this kind of nominalization into a number of more detailed types, such as agentive nominalization, objective nominalization, instrument nominalization, and locative nominalization. In Majang, there is no
one-to-one correlation between these nominalization types and any of the
various nominalization forms introduced in the following sections.","[226, 227, 228, 229]"
"IV.2.1.3 Infinite verbs
There are two different infinite verb forms in Majang: infinitive and negative. For the majority of verbs these forms can be accomplished by adding a
productive suffix to the stem. These suffixes are presented in section
IV.2.2.1 Infinite verb forms below. Both forms are syntactically verbal
nouns, but at least the infinitive can still serve as the semantic predicate of a
subject or object clause (see examples IV.100 and V.121). The negative
form is quite restricted in its use, but the infinitive form has all the morphological characteristics of a noun, which means that it can be inflected for
number and case. Many nouns of the lexicon are in fact lexicalized infinitive
forms. Other nouns are derived from verbs by the use of some less productive nominalization devices provided by the Majang morphology; these often
result in lexicalized meanings, not as predictable as the ones gleaned from
the infinitive or negative verb forms.",[217]
"Tone95would therefore expect that this low tone just becomes associated with the
syllable, in this way eliminating the offending presence of both the toneless
syllable and the unassociated floating low tone. The Majang language
instead opts for leaving the floating low tone unassociated, while dealing
with the toneless syllable through tone copying from the stem. Other morphemes, such as the 3P.CJ marker -ɛr on ɗɛjɛr ‘they want’, have a fixed low
tone, which is always realized on the syllable itself. There is no apparent
alternative to an analysis which assumes that there is an underlying difference between an associated low tone on some morphemes (such as on -ɛr
‘3P.CP’) and a non-associated, floating low tone on other morphemes, such as
the noun-plural marker -ɛL. The underlying representation of these two morphemes must be different, as they behave differently in word formation.
At least some phonologists claim that each floating tone must connect to an
available toneless TBU. The Tone Mapping Rule in Halle and Vergnaud
(1982, p. 67), which they adopted from Williams (1976), would clearly rule
out Majang’s behavior. One way to uphold the Tone Mapping Rule is an assumption that the floating L is created in the process of the tone-spreading.
Such a conclusion might be drawn as a result of the fact that almost all toneless morphemes behave like the 3P.DJ marker -irL or the plural marker -ɛL –
they have an inherent floating L. This could invite an analysis involving a
rule that somehow adds this floating low tone to a toneless morpheme whenever the resulting surface tone on the suffix is high. Unfortunately, this proposed rule is rendered untenable by the presence of a few toneless morphemes without a floating L when a H spreads on the toneless syllable. Some
non-modified plural nominative suffixes, for example, clearly copy the stem
tone without using a floating low tone, as in càkomà < càkom-à ‘friends
(NOM)’ or wàrtùn < wàr-tùn ‘dogs (NOM)’. There is therefore no rule in Majang
that places a floating L following high-tone copying. All other attempts to
maintain the constraint would require assumptions about tone replacement
on what is here called a toneless morpheme, and such an analysis would
make very complicated what can easily be described in terms of tone spreading. Other languages display similar violations, such as the Bantu languages
Kikuria and Chiyao (Odden, 1995, p. 459), although the floating tone involved in those languages is a high tone. In the following, all morphemes
with a similar behavior as the 3P.DJ markers -ɛrL and -irL, or the plural marker
L
-ɛ , are represented in the examples as being toneless with an unassociated
floating low tone. Other analyses of their behavior may be possible, but I
leave these to be worked out by those who have a higher interest in main-96Chapter II.6taining the validity of the above universal that such morphemes should not
exist in any language.
One particular morpheme of the Majang language, the 1P.DJ suffix on the
verb, also shows variation, but in a different manner than toneless suffixes.
Example II.35: polar tone on the 1P.DJ suffix
a) toníːL
{ton-í ,ːL}
tell-1P.DJ
we tellb)gùːgùɲíː
{gùːgùɲ-í ,ːL}
enter-1P.DJ
we enterThe 1P.DJ suffix consistently has a high tone following a low-toned stem (example a), and a low tone following a high-toned stem (example b). If it receives a high tone, it again causes downstep on a following high-toned word.
It is therefore assumed that the suffix in its underlying representation is
equipped with both a polar tone and a floating low tone, and is therefore represented in the lexicon as -í ,ːL, where the superscript cross symbol represents
the polar tone.
For the two Gur languages Moore and Lama the authors Kenstowicz, Nikiema and Ourso (1988) demonstrated that polar tone goes back to an underlying high tone that is dissimilated when following another high tone as an instance of Meeussen’s Rule (HH → HL), which applies to avoid violations of
the Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP). If this were the case in Majang,
then the underlying representation of the 1P.DJ suffix would be -íːL. It would
keep its shape when following a low-toned stem, and when following a high
tone, OCP would force it to be realized as -íː. Such an analysis would have
the advantage of providing the suffix with a more regular position in the paradigm, where most other person markers also have a high tone, such as
1S.DJ -à or 2S.DJ -ín. The conjoint forms of these, including the 1st person
plural, have a fixed low tone: -à, -ín and -íː.
In spite of these benefits, such an analysis is not tenable for Majang. There
are countless morphemes in Majang with a lexical high tone that do not undergo Meeussen’s Rule to avoid a violation of OCP. These include the other
members of the disjoint person paradigm listed above. When these follow a
high-toned stem, they are subject to morpheme downstep, which is the language’s device of choice to deal with OCP violations. It could be argued that
the long vowel of the 1P suffix may trigger a different strategy, but there are
other long-voweled morphemes such as the disjoint impersonal marker -ɛːLTone97(as in ɓɔ̀lɔ̀ːꜜrɛːL ‘one grows’) that refute this idea. It undergoes morpheme
downstep like all other high-toned suffixes. Consequently, the only way to
describe the 1P.DJ morpheme is to assume an underlying representation that
includes its polar-tone behavior24. Majang can therefore be listed among the
languages that support Newman’s (1995, p. 775) and Cahill’s (2004) idea
that at least for some languages one can assume genuine tonal polarity.","[100, 101, 102, 103]"
"The Sentence-Final Topicality Marker (sft)143These two main clauses were originally seen by the informants as being
parts of the same sentence. The use of the SFT-marker following the first
verb, however, does not allow such an interpretation – that text segment
needs to be analyzed as containing two syntactically independent sentences.50
Two additional problems remain with the interpretation of =ŋ as a sentencefinal topicality marker. First, there are a few instances like the following
example where the SFT-marker is used and where absolutely no topical participant appears to be involved in the clause. These examples contain impersonal weather or environmental verbs.

DEM-SG-SP-POSSThis sentence, at first glance, may fit better with the analysis of =ŋ as a
marker for argument indexation only, as proposed in Joswig (2015) – there I
assumed a completely syntactic rule governing its appearance on verb
phrases, whenever no other constituents were present in the sentence. This
analysis made no reference to pragmatic factors, but also had to wrongly
ignore all occurrences of =ŋ on noun phrases. An alternative interpretation,
in line with the idea of =ŋ as a topicality marker, is that weather and environmental verbs indeed refer to topical entities, that is the weather and the
general environment – the interaction of these with the narrative can be
taken for granted and is grounded in the world-view of the speech-act participants.51
Second – and this can be illustrated with the same example III.39 – this
sentence has material following the verb marked by the SFT-marker. Majang
narratives frequently use such expressions which seem to express the attitude
of the narrator (see examples IV.267 and V.138b), and which are usually
translated as ‘just like this’. It might be possible to analyze them as extraclausal and even extra-sentence material which is thrown in by the narrator
after the sentence as such is finished, but before the next sentence begins.
50See example V.126 for an apparent exception to the rule that the SFT-clitic closes every sentence.
