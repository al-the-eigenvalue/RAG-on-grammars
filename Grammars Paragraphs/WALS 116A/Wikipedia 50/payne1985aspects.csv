"(Some) modal formatives are affixal to the verb.
Embedded verbs generally follow the embedding verb.
Clausal objects follow the main verb.
There is no overt copula.
_
Placement of the yes/no question particle is specified with
reference to the beginning of clause (second position within C).
In information questions, the questioned NP is fronted
('movement' of questioned NPs from embedded clauses is also
a possibility at least for subjects).
Some adverbial and complement clause types follow their main
clause (though conditionals and other -tiy clauses precede
their main clause).
Complementizers precede their clause.",[407]
