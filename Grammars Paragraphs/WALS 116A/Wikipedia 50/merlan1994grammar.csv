"12.4. Interpersonal and emphatic elements
The small set of elements described under this heading do not fit neatly under any of the
other headings in this chapter. They are even rather diverse among themselves. The
inference should not be made from the heading given here that these are the only elements
that have an ""interpersonal"" dimension (see Halliday and Hasan 1976: 26 who use this
term for the ""social, expressive and conative functions of language""), but rather that these
elements have functions which are more centrally definable in those terms than others.
12.4.1. (Tag) question: Ale
There is a question element ale (see Cook 1987:93 for the form ngale in Wakiman) which
is usually final in relation to what is questioned, and thus usually a ""tag"" question marker.
In general, it follows a statement of some kind, and, in the same speaking ""turn"", directs
the addressee to confirm or deny the correctness of the speaker's statement. However, it
may be used not by the original speaker, but in a different turn, to question whether what
the speaker said is correct, and in this usage it is thus not a ""tag"", but a more independent
question element (see example (828) in 12.5.3.). It may follow a positive or negative
statement, but tends to occur after the former; positive statements followed by request
for confirmation are more common than negative ones. It may be glossed 'is that right?'
or'is that so'?
In the first example below, ale is used text-internally. That is, it is not a request for
confirmation directed by the speaker to another person sitting with us in the immediate320 Chapter 12speech situation at the time the material was recorded, but rather a question directed by
the speaker of the narrated speech situation, a European policeman, to an Aboriginal
woman, the speaker's sister. The story being told to me by the speaker and another
woman, in turns, was about how European policeman used to come check up whether
there were any part-Aboriginal children living in camps, and if there were, they used to
remove them to institutions. A policeman came to check up, and found a part-Aboriginal
child in the speaker's family.

He picked it up'.
The second example illustrates the use of ale within the immediate speech situation. A
woman narrating a story relating to a place we were visiting was perhaps somewhat
intimidated by the presence of a man she thought might know more than she, and so she
directed confirmatory ale to him throughout her narration.

12.4.2. Bago 'that's it'
A second interpersonal element appears to be similar to ale in that it frequently occurs in
interaction, and constitutes it as a joint effort. But in this case, bago is used to signal that
that which was sought within the speech situation (whether an element of language, word
or the like, or something else) has been found; hence the gloss 'that's it', or perhaps 'this
is it' (and the abbreviation CF ""confirmatory"").","[343, 344]"

"12.5. Interjections and related forms
All of the forms described in this section can be used as interjections, that is, as
independent utterances. A small number, however (see ngawun and ngala below) also
occur in other speech functions.
12.5.1. Gayawun 'wait, just a minute'
Etymologically, gayawun may be analyzed as composed of the root gaya 'today, now',
and an adjectival, noun-forming ending -wun (~ -gun, see 9.4.). Literally glossed
according to its etymology, the form means ""relating to today, now"".
This word (which often occurs as gayawun-bi, with article suffix) fills the function of
adverbial ""still, yet, for awhile"", or ""now"" in relation to the clausal time-frame, as in the
following two examples:
(828)nga-gaju-rri

HT-3SG-begayawun-bi
still-ART'She has no pubic [hair], no axillary [hair], let her be yet/for awhile'.
However, the implementation of the adverbial notion of ""still"" within the immediate
speech situation — that is, ""now"" in relation to the moment of speaking — is realized
with gayawun (or gayawun-bi), which here means 'wait!, hang on!', or the like, and may
be used as an interjection.

Yilgbayi 'all right, enough', may be used as nominal quantifier, as adverb, and as
interjection. As quantifier, it occurs in clausal ""absolutive"" case functions:
(831) yllgbayi
enough0-ngu-ndi
3SG-eat-PSTjornog

(832)yilgbayi

yilgbayi
OKyi-jomogba-rri
2SG-full up-PST'But what about you, are you full?'
'[I'm] OK'.
12.5.3. Yawe 'yes'
The affirmative yawe is used either to answer a question posed by someone else, or (as
also in English) to create a cohesive link within the text of a single speaker, by signalling
that the text is about to proceed. Examples of both kinds follow. In the first, yawe is used
within the text of a single speaker to represent a response in a narrated speech situation.
In this segment of text, narrated by Elsie Raymond, she represents her grandmother as
telling her a story of an early massacre; and herself, as listener many years ago, asking
""Is that right?"", to which her grandmother replies, ""Yes"".

Issues in constituency and word order10.1. The question of fn:e word order
As modern description of Ausfalian languages intensified from the early 1970s, it was
commonly said that they exhibited ""free"" word order, both at the level of the phrase and
the clause (Dixon 1972; Sharpe 1972; see also more recently Simpson 1991, Chapter 2,
where ""free word order"" is desc ibed as a defining dimension of ""non-configurationality""
for the Pama-Nyungan language, Warlpiri). The general claim is that constituent wordlevel units can be found in almost any order and the phrase or clause still be grammatically
acceptable. Taken in that baiic sense, Wardaman, too, exhibits greater freedom of
ordering than does English, for example.
Some researchers, however, have reported of their languages that not all orders are
equally common within the pirase or clause (Heath 1984; Merlan 1988; McGregor
1990). They have observed tha: ordering is freer than in English and many of the world's
better-known languages, but ha /e sought to open the question, Free with respect to what?
In other words, they have begun to explore the question whether the grammatical notion
of the ""clause"" is the appropriate basis in terms of which to describe ordering phenomena.
In my opinion, the answer wh ch is beginning to emerge from this work is that other
levels of analysis—for example, intersections between constituent structure possibilities
and their typical prosodically organized syntagmatic realizations — must be the units
against which different word-level orderings, and their differing frequency and
meaningfulness, need to be defined.
We can illustrate from Wardaman examples the difficulties which arise in attempting
to define any particular noun phrase on the basis of constituent structure only, in order
to show how these problems have informed the approach taken further on in this chapter.
Many of the issues involved have been previously noted for their general descriptive
interest. Consider the first few lines of the text (appended) Jalijbang, about a moon
dreaming place on Innesvale Siation.
A protagonist, of Yiwalyarri iubsection, is identified. Then:
(527) yanggi bogogo gangma.i yorri
'He went hunting and sheared a kangaroo'
mangali
'a female'
wurre-warang
'with young/a joey'.
Then the information given to that point is summarized:224 Chapter 10(528) yorri nana gangman wiirre-warang
'He speared the kangaroo with a joey'.
Obviously, in the text as given, line divisions have already been made which appear to
be of some significance. These, as will be described, are tone groups. At first,
information is being conveyed in a manner that may be called ""expansion"": only a small
""bit"" is given in each apparent unit. Then a structurally more elaborate summation is
given, that is, one in which the word-level units can evidently be assumed to comprise a
whole unit (in this case, clause) in a way the preceding shorter units cannot. That clause
contains a nominal constituent structure which is not uncommon in Wardaman,
consisting of a demonstrative determiner, plus nominal plus a nominal modifier of the
""having X"" kind described in 5.3. In fact, as we will see, phrases consisting of the first
two elements — demonstrative plus open-class nominal — are the commonest kind of
two-word noun phrase in Wardaman, and the position of the ""having"" modifier following
the entity is also typical (although such ""having"" constructions may of course occur by
themselves, as the sole word of a noun phrase). The more elaborate phrase shows us a
typical way in which the NP may be realized by a syntagm of words. The preceding
lines, however, cannot be identified as a single NP. One of the main reasons for that must
be taken to be the fact that preceding words do not all occur within a single unit as defined
by prosodic criteria. Semantically, we see that the descriptions ""female"", and ""having
joey"" further specify the reference of ""kangaroo"", for which here the generic term, rather
than any existing, specifically female term, was originally used. A phrase consisting of
an open-class nominal such as ""kangaroo"", and then followed within the same tone unit
by two additional nominal descriptors, would in fact be unusual. It is best to conclude
that in the preceding lines ""kangaroo"", ""female"", and ""having joey"" do not constitute a
phrase, continuous or discontinuous, but together constitute a typical association of
prosodically distinguished units of information.
To even begin to assemble the evidence concerning what may, and what may not,
constitute a ""phrase"", we have to have some criteria of identification. One must, as is
ordinarily done, take into account the possible function or role of given words within a
conceivable grammatical constituent structure; but identification as a phrase cannot be
made ONLY on such grammatical bases, concerning the possible assignment of words to
constituent structure. If that were the only criterion, we might be tempted for example
to regardgangnian mangali wurre-warang as a discontinuous noun phrase, and perhaps
also to attempt permutations of these words in relation to the verb ""speared"", in order to
establish possibilities of ordering within the clause as a whole. Any or all of such
attempted permutations, I feel quite confident, would be accepted by informants as
intelligible. In doing that, however, we would lose sight of the fact that a group such as
gangnian ntangali wurre-warang is at least not usual within a single prosodically defined
unit.
It is common for constituent structure to be defined with respect to attested examples
which show the apparent full range of possibilities of realization. What I am suggesting
here, however, may appear to some to go too far: that is, that what may count as an attested
example of a particular kind must be defined with respect to some apparently significantIssues in constituency and word order 225criteria that belong to other levels of linguistic organization beyond the simply
grammatical. We have noted the common report that, when what is taken as the central
issue is ""grammaticality"", many Australian languages appear to exhibit such freedom in
ordering that the result has often been stated as ""any order is possible"". But that does not
tell us what orderings are morj frequent than others, or distinguish the meaningfulness
of the different orders. And when frequency becomes an issue alongside grammaticality,
then it must also be asked, in what contexts do particular orders occur? Ways must be
found of discriminating different linguistic contexts, and I am simply suggesting that that
cannot be done with respect :o the same phenomenon one is attempting, in the first
instance, to describe — grammatical function within constituency. Rather it must be
done with respect to actual realizations of syntagms which differ meaningfully.
Obviously, like some other Australianists (Heath 1984; McGregor 1990; all of us
following Halliday and others of the Firthian school), I accept that prosodically defined
units appear to be a significant and much under-studied resource for identifying contexts
with respect to which different realizations of constituent structure may be defined.","[245, 246, 247, 248, 249]"

the phrasegudang-jila wu-jaba-wunba 'from which house?'
7.5.4. 'When?' nyangurlang
'When?' is expressed by the interrogative nyangurlang, which looks as if it might be
analyzed as containing an irregular form of the (directional) Allative suffix. However,
the proposed initial stem is not otherwise attested.

it is understood to mean ""what kind of X?"" A common question of this kind is:

word-ABS'What's the word?'
This is used in the sense ""What's the news?"", ""What's happened?"", ""What did they
say?"", and the like.
This interrogative may also be used in a more general sense, not to question a particular
nominal, but (often with indefinite suffix, see 7.5.7.) to ask ""what kind?"" of an entire
proposition. Used in this way, it can be meant to express, for example, ""how many?""

"Thus nganayu may be a negative response to a predication, often as above a proposal,
and may be taken to express 'let it be' concerning what is predicated. The person ""not
liking"" is assumed to be the speaker, unless otherwise indicated. There is an explicit
means for placing person in relation to this form, by means of the dative pronoun series:
nganayu nganu Ί don't like it', nganayu yinggi 'you don't like it', nganayu wurrugu
'they don't like it', and so forth. It is possible to form a complement in which the person
""not liking"" is also the agent of the action, with particle or nominalized verb form and
the case suffix -warr:

12.5.6. Gala-warda 'who knows? I don't know'
The particle gala 'try' (12.2.3.) expresses uncertainty concerning an as-yet unrealized
event, with different modulations of intentionality depending upon the ""basic""
paradigmatic form of the predicate. It was illustrated in examples (734) and (735) that
the particle suffixed with indefinite -warda (7.5.8.) is used as response meaning ""it's
uncertain"", or ""I don't know"". It may be clearly interjectional in that such a response
may stand on its own, in relation of course to a previous conversational turn.
12.5.7. Ngala, emphatic confirmation
The conjunction ngala (12.3.3.) signals a break in relation to previous text. It may be
either strongly adversative, equivalent to English ""but""; or less strongly so, and often
understood as a topic-changing ""but what about?"".
There is a further interjectional use of ngala, as emphatic confirmation in response to
a question. In the instances attested the polarity of such questions has been positive, as
in the following exchange in which a woman speaker was recounting the taking away of
her sister's child by a welfare officer to the writer and another woman, B:

7.5.6. Emphatic (question) suffix -gula
In this and the following two sub-sections three suffixes are discussed which occur with
interrogative expressions and contribute different sorts of modal flavourings. The first
of these, -gula, appears to be the most emphatic and demanding of response (and/or
agreement), perhaps equivalent in feeling-tone to a loudly-spoken ""that's right?"". Its
emphatic character is indicated by the fact that it is one of the few words in the language
which is often followed by phonetic glottal stop — another is the question tag ale
(12.4.1.). Its distribution, however, distinguishes it from the latter, in that -gula as
recorded generally has a single (nominal) element or phrase within its scope and not an
entire proposition, as ale may. -gula is also phrase-final, and not followed by any
grammatical suffix; in this it differs from another question suffix -gan, discussed in the
next section.
Examples of -gula are:

Dissociative- and Source-marked; suffixed with adverbial -barra ~ -warra in very

Vowels do not occur morpheme-initially in Wardaman, except in the tag-question particle
ale (this is one of the few Wardaman words often produced with an audible, final glottal
constriction, indicative of the intensity of the tag question syntagm 'is that so?'). It was
noted above that the noun class prefixes /wu/ and /yi/, i.e., with homorganic semivowel
and vowel, are commonly realized as [u] and [/]. In other such word-initial combinations,
the glide tends to remain unreduced, or somewhat less so; and the semivowel is not
reduced in initial combination with non-homorganic vowel:
[Vw/τεη]
['wUjbln]
[yu'gUrni]'child'
'greedy'
'more, again'However, there is some variation, and there are some words, like /wuja/ 'fire, wood',
which appear to be commonly realized in both ways. In that word, it is likely the /wu/
is etymologically the noun class prefix, synchronically however to be analyzed as part
of the root. Leaving aside the matter of the noun class prefixes, and other instances of
word-initial /wu/ and /yi/ which may vary somewhat in degree of realization of the
semivowel, there is, as noted in 2.1., no cause to recognize vowel-initial morphemes in
Wardaman. The difference between morpheme-initial glide plus homorganic vowel, and
vowel alone, is environmentally limited (i.e., most common in the nominal class
markers), and never minimally distinctive. The absence or infrequency of vowel-initial
morphemes is also characteristic of a number of neighbouring languages, including
Mangarrayi, Yangman, and Jawoyn. Slightly further east, we find a very limited range
of α-initial morphemes in Alawa (Sharpe 1972) and Ngalakan (Merlan 1983: 11). In
Wardaman, there are a few inflectional morphemes that have the shape C (e.g., present
tense suffix -n, but none consists only of V, or has initial V.
As noted in 1.3., the mid-vowels do not occur in any of the inflectional morphology,
which exhibits a three-vowel system, a, i, and u. There is, however, no lack of surface
mid-vowels in inflectional morphs, due to phonetic processes of assimilation (3.7.3.).
Among derivational morphemes and lexical suffixes, too, the mid-vowels are rare, but
there are instances, such as adverbial /beng/, expressing location or place where. The
mid-vowels are widely distributed over lexemes, and there is no particular evidence of
""defective"" distribution with respect to any word class. Though /a/, /i/ and /u/ are more
common finally than the mid-vowels, there are nonetheless quite a number of examples
of Id and /o/ finally, e.g.,: bone 'across'; ngajamberle, proper name; lowe, toponym;
bogo 'lend', jewele 'close, near', wume 'sky', modborrongo, proper name; and
inflectional forms of quite a number of verbs.
Examples of minimal and sub-minimal vowel contrasts are:
jin(ma)
jen(ma)
juny(ma)
jongmajangma-'blame'
'cut into pieces'
'set' (of sun, celestial body)
'to kiss'
'to defecate'16 Chapter 2There are no vowel clusters.
See 3.7.3. for further remarks on distribution of the mid-vowels.","[37, 38, 39, 40]"
"10.10. The ordering of object, agent and subject
In 10.1. I suggested that it is not possible to approach certain questions of word order
with only the issue of ""grammaticality"" in mind, in Wardaman and other Australian
languages. Informants, when asked, will approve different orders within the phrase and
the elicitation sentence as grammatically acceptable and meaningful. But another matter
is what they will actually say themselves, with all the attendant questions of relative
frequency of different orders, and the meaningful organization of textual matter. The
clause is the understood unit of analysis with respect to which summaries of major
constituent ordering are usually made (as in formulae such as SVO, SOV etc.). But this
assumes that issues of ordering are fundamentally issues of clause-level grammatical
structure. There are however many other issues besides grammaticality which have to
do with the occurrence and ordering of nominal constituents.
Some observations drawn from text material will be summarized here about the
positioning of the direct object, the ergative-marked transitive agent, and the intransitive
subject. These observations were made on text material that had been organized into
tone units. As I noted above this chapter, this organization was basic in that no thorough
analysis into primary and secondary intonation units was made, although such further
study seems promising. Rather, a simple division into tone units or contours was made
on the main criterion of pitch movement (generally but not always strongly linked with
pause phenomena). Once this is done, it becomes possible to talk about ordering of overt
noun phrases fulfilling major syntactic functions within the tone unit and with respect to
an occurring verb.
There is an important general issue of the lexical realization of participants. The other
side of the coin is ellipsis (and what may be somewhat different, failure for participants
to be lexically specified through local portions of text, a more general question of
narrative style that will not be further discussed). The fact that two nominal functions
may be marked on the inflecting Wardaman verb by pronominal prefixes is linked to theIssues in constituency and word order 247fact of extensive nominal ellipsis particularly of nominals in intransitive and transitive
subject functions.
For instance, in the text Jalijbang, the protagonist Moon is introduced lexically in unit
(1) by his subsection, Yiwalyarri, but is not designated again lexically until unit (83),
where he is referred to as gandawag 'moon'. By that time he has been the understood
agent of 31 transitive constructions and numerous intransitive ones. There is only one
occurrence of an ergative-marked noun in the entire text of 110 units, at 102 where
Moon's wives return, figure out what has happened, and say, Oh! here the old man-ERG
is keeping/has his mother-in-law. The relatively straightforward story-line as told, one
might say, makes it possible for Moon to be the understood and largely ellipsed agent
and subject of numerous transitive and intransitive verbs (and, interestingly, in this story
the object of none).
In the text Gawalyan, the first main character introduced is echidna herself. She is
identified by the single noungawalyan 'echidna' on the first tone unit of the text. This
is not ergative-marked, despite the fact that the next unit gives the information ""She had
a small child"". The naming of echidna simply identifies her, and carries no clear
indication of grammatical function. Such naming as the content of a tone unit, amounting
to apposition of participants rather than specification of grammatical function, is a
common feature of Wardaman text. In the Gawalyan text, echidna is not lexically
identified again until line 26, where some birds ask her husband to lend his wife
fyingawuyu) to them for sexual intercourse. This request, with lexical designation of
echidna as ""wife"", is repeated in line 28. Then there is no further lexical identification
of echidna until a final one in line 43, where she is described as having beenyibarnbarnin
'naked, hairless', until she was speared for refusing the birds, and so acquired quills.
There is no instance of ergative-marked agent in the entire text; for after the aggressor
birds have been lexically identified once (in lines 22 and 23, on tone units which name
them in absolutive case form), they are designated only by pronominal prefixes (subject
and object) on the verb throughout the remainder of the text.
The two cases above might be among the texts where there is least lexical designation
of protagonists, and reference maintenance to protagonists principally through
pronominal prefixation. A text which shows more considerable lexical specification of
protagonists is Gumurrinji and Bornorron ""Emu and Brolga"". Here, emu asks brolga to
mind her children along with brolga's own while emu goes out foraging, and as in some
Shakespearean plots, there is ample possibility for confusioa Perhaps for that reason,
emu is lexically designated 6 times in a relatively short text, as is brolga; three of the
latter occurrences are Ergative-marked, as brolga maliciously destroys emu's children
while she is away. Nevertheless there is no case in which both agent and object are
lexically specified on the same tone unit, and thus no specific evidence for the ordering
of ""brolga"" and ""emu"" with respect to each other as lexemes in particular major syntactic
functions. Overall, lexical specification of agent and object in the same tone unit is rare
textually, but there are instances (such as Dalyarra line 30, ""two-ERG women- ERG held
her legs-ABS on either side"", or the order AVO).
In attempting to calculate the occurrence of overt nominals as agents, subjects and
objects, it seemed important to distinguish cases in which they occurred within the same248 Chapter 10tone unit as the verbal word(s) bearing pronominal agreement, versus those in which they
occurred on another tone group (often, set off as simple nouns or nominal expressions
on a tone unit by themselves in absolutive form, or sometimes with case specification).
Table 18 shows tabulations derived from 24 texts of nominal (including pronominal)
elements in given functions — as direct objects, intransitive subjects, and (ergativemarked) agents, and their position pre- or post-verbally within the tone unit.

61There is a higher absolute number of lexically specified objects throughout the texts
compared to the other two categories. Ergative-marked agents are much less common
over all texts than are subjects and objects. There is a tendency for lexically specified
nouns or noun phrases in all functions to occur more frequently before the verbal word
rather than after it. In the long Elsie text, for example, 40 specified objects occur within
tone units before the verbal word, and 31 after it. Objects and ergative-marked agents
show much less difference as between position before and after the verbal word than do
subjects, which show a rather more marked tendency to occur before the verb.
In the Elsie text, of 17 instances of ergative-marked agent noun or noun phrase, 4
occurred on a tone group set off by themselves. In each of those instances the noun or
noun phrase follows the tone unit containing the verb which carries its pronominal
reference. In one case of an ergative agent so set off, it follows a tone unit with
ergative-marked noun, and gives a different description of the referent (i.e., in the first
unit the ergative marked noun is nntlwru-yi Old woman', the one set off by itself,
barnagbarnang-nyi 'auntie', an alternative description).
Of the 17 instances of ergative marking, in only two tone units are both agent and object
lexically specified In one case the order is VOA (bujnrri walanja nuilurru-yi Old
woman dug the goanna', where both goanna and the old woman have been previously
mentioned and are clearly recoverable). In the second, the order is OVA (a nawurla
wu-di-rri-ya-wuya nnilitrru-wuya-yi ' Oh! the two old women have brought nawurla').
In every instance, the ergative-marked noun or noun phrase is human. There are 7
occurrences oinuilurm ornnilurni-wnya' old woman' or' two old women'; 5 oimeniden
'white man'; 3 of kin terms; 1 of mar lug a ' old man'; and 1 of a personal name.
In the Galapin text, there are 9 ergative-marked instances. In only two of these are both
agent and object present. One of these is an unusual case of verbal ellipsis (see 10.13.);
but the order of noun phrases is A O. In the second, the order is AVO.","[270, 271, 272]"
"Issues in constituency and word order 24310.8. Summary of noun phrase constituency
We may now draw together a summary of basic noun phrase constituency discussed so
far, and briefly consider aspects of noun phrase coordination.
We may minimally identify structural noun phrase types as shown in Table 17.
17. Noun phrase structures
Type(l)Type(2)NPNP(N, PRO) (N)Type (3a)(3b)
NPSDem N(3c)
NPAdj (Adv) N Poss Ntype
NP4
NPNP NP NPIn Type 1, the noun phrase consists of a single lexical noun or personal pronoun, and
there is no phrase-internal syntax.
Type 2 has a clause-level constituent, and is a cover term for the general subordinate
clause type discussed in 8.15., and for the complex particle and nominalized verbal
complementizers which are discussed in Chapter 11. As is noted there, such
complements tend to be syntactically truncated, with minimal overt specification of
participants, with the exception of the allative-marked object of a complement (11.7.).
Several sub-types of head-attribute construction are shown in 3. 3(a) stands for the
common construction in which a demonstrative modifies the head; as noted above, and
further discussed in 10.9 below, there is variation is ordering of the elements, but ageneral
tendency for most demonstratives to precede the modified, most of the time. 3(b) stands
for a number of other sub-types, in which an interrogative, indefinite or other qualifier
modifies the head, and there may be some kind of adverbial modifying element. Type
3(c) stands for the possessive phrase, of several particular types as discussed: possessor
expressed by genitive pronoun (tending to precede the head), by dative pronoun
following it, or both together flanking it; or nominal possessor expressed by dativemarking on the possessor and agreement with an independent dative pronoun. Finally, 4
represents a coordinate noun phrase structure which may now be considered briefly.
It is common enough for semantically and syntactically related noun phrases to occur
on separate tone units, each one in some way adding information to the others. For
example, in a myth concerning porcupine, her husband goes out hunting and runs into
some birds, one kind of which, manamanagban (honeyeater?) is explicitly mentioned:
'He caught up to the honeyeaters, they were calling to him'. The tale continues:

There is no question that such are to be seen as separate phrases, and indeed the
identification and qualification of participants in separate tone units in this way is a
regular feature of Wardaman texts. Whether phrases in separate tone units refer to the
same entity in different ways, or designate different entities which in many instances may
be construed as having the same role within the text as above, it is out of the question to
regard these as sub-parts of the same phrase.
However, it is also common for nouns to occur together within the same tone unit,
identically case-marked and sharing a participant role, but without overt coordinator. In
fact, there is little evidence of explicit coordination in Wardaman. It would seem that
such elements as the ""focal member of pair"" suffix (5.6.1.) imply coordination, even
though the second member of the pair NEED NOT be explicitly designated, but may be
mentioned (as in the example ngabida-warrma nawurla, see (528) above). Coordination
is achieved simply by juxtaposition, and Type 4 allows for this.

3SG-DISS [now]'She went away from her now foraging for green and black plum'.
A few special issues which relate to coordination are worthy of mention here. There
are some textual examples in which one finds apparently coordinate nouns, identically
marked with case or adverbial ending, but where their having the same grammatical role
within the clause appears counterintuitive. Consider for example in the text Onion, line
30. Here two girls who are preparing food are being cajoled by a man to give him what
they are cooking. One of them hesitates, because of the flirtatious implications of a
woman giving a man cooked food; but the other girl urges her to give it. She does so,
and the man takes the meat, cuts raw onion on top of it, and eats it. The line of interest
is:
(601) anyin-barra
[onion]-ADVlayln-barra
meat-ADV0-ngu-ndi
3SG-eat-PSTgirdibun
finish'He ate the meat and onion up'.
One might expect onion to be marked with the adverbial, comitative ending, for the
idea being conveyed is that he ate the meat WITH onion. But instead, both ""onion"" and
""meat"" are marked with the adverbial ending. Nothing is expressed as direct object.
Consider another example which is different in some respects, but basically similar in
that an unexpected ""spreading"" of case-marking appears to be involved. In the text
Goyin, there is description of bees depositing eggs in the comb. It is said that the honey
body (yi-nyeyn) extends right up to/towards the ""nose"" of the honey-comb. ""Nose"" is
allative-marked (see 5.2.5.). The lines of interest are reproduced below:Issues in constituency and word order 245(602)yi-nyeyn

YI-nose-ALL-ADV'The honey body up to/towards the nose'
yi-jum-garr
YI-nose-ALLnan-garr
that-ALLgoyi-warr
honey-ALL'to the nose ofthat honey'.
We might expect the apparent possessor (or whole of which yijurn is a part), goyin
'honey', to be dative marked. Instead we find that it is allative marked like ""nose"".
Another instance of similar kind can be seen in the text Elsie (46) (see also discussion in
10.4. above, insofar as this last example poses questions about ""classifying""
constructions).
These have the appearance of 'coordinate' phrases like the one exemplified in (600),
but present an anomaly in that commonly marked nominals would seem to have different
semantic case roles in the clause. Evidently these are instances of the ""spread"" of caseand adverbial marking across a number of co-occurring nominal constituents.","[266, 267, 268, 269]"
"Segmental phonology 17The contrast between apical series is amply illustrated elsewhere, morpheme- and
word-medially and finally. In word-final position note the contrasts between members
of each series:
/gulid/
/menjen/'green plum'
'dangerous'vs.
vs.
vs./mardird/
/mejern/
/yingelembern/'whistling kite'
'belly'
'collarbone'/jurrul/'saltwater turtle'vs./nyurl/'be/get angry'There are additionally numerous examples of minimal and sub-minimal contrasts
medially between the two series: e.g., wu-walu 'ring finger' vs. wu- warli 'arm, creek,
tributary'; yirrgitlun 'river' vs.yigurliyn 'first rain'; ngone 'hooked spear' vs. wurne
'bone'; yi-welen 'jealousperson' vs.yi-werlen 'lazy person'; bidij 'twist' vs.birdij'find'
(particles); gelelen 'cold' vs. gerle- 'to taste'; gitda 'where' vs. bigurda, a kind of plat
potato; gadi 'lily' vs. gardirrg 'gnash teeth' (particle), and so on.
The above generalization does not apply to the rhotics, since /IT/ has not been found
initially in lexical stems, and only two instances of /r/ have been noted to date: the bird
term rewrew 'dollar bird', and a toponym (referring to a creek near Willeroo Station
homestead in the Wardaman heartland, and seemingly not a foreign form), Relwuyugun.
Besides the fact that the bird term is onomatopoetic, it should also be noted that very
similar terms for this bird occur in neighbouring languages. It is likely that there are
complex diffusional relations among them. However, in Jawoyn the form of the word is
dewdew, and beyond the surmise that the diffusional source is not from Jawoyn, it is not
clear why Wardaman should have a form with an initial segment that does not otherwise
occur in that position in the language.
/rr/ does occur initially in inflectional morphemes which can never be word-initial, e.g.,
in the past tense allomorph -rri. /r/ is (so far) not attested in stem-final position, indicating
at the least that it is c[uite uncommon there, if indeed it may occur at all. The apical /rr/
however is common finally, e.g., /bamarr/ Owenia vernicosa, 'marble tree', /geremerr/
'headband', and so on.
Medially, the contrast between the two rhotics distinguishes a considerable number of
forms, and there is no reason to regard the contrast as marginal (cf. Cook 1987: 29 on
Wakiman). Exemplifying by comparing the sequences -ara- and-arra-, we may list the
contrasting forms, among others: war ay 'ask', baraj 'far', garab 'spider', wuniara
'heavy stone', janiaram1 lid, doof,garnaniara 'walking stick' Jabara 'putrid, stinking',
barangan 'rift,gap',darab 'bog', and-garang ~ -warang 'having'; vs. barlarra 'hide',
barragarl 'spear', buwarraja 'dreaming', lawarra 'riflefish', warrala 'lie, be spreadlegged5, warrania ' sugar glider', -barra ~ -warra adverbial suffix, among others.
Some consideration needs to be given to the statement of the distributions of the two
palatal sonorants ly and ny. We will consider the lamino-palatal lateral first, since its
distribution, however analyzed, is especially restricted Then we will return to questions
of the statement of distribution that apply to both lateral and nasal palatal segments.
The lamino-palatal lateral (unlike the nasal) never occurs in stem- or word-initial
position, and its occurrence medially (excluding, for the moment, intervocalically) and18 Chapter 2finally is quite restricted, both lexically and positionally. The following includes all
instances of medial (save intervocalic) and final ly found in a list of approximately 2000
(mostly lexical) roots (excluding names of all sorts, personal, toponymic and other):
bedelybedeyl

'wring out, squeeze (juices) out of
'beat, thump, ""heart-crack"" [Kr.], be shocked'
'stretch'
'whistle' (different AUX from above)
'bother, annoy'This list demonstrates that about half the instances of the lamino-palatal lateral are final
in verb particles (which often have the additional morph -ma, see 11.1.2.)· Otherwise,
the lateral occurs only before peripheral segments (mainly stops b and g, but note one
instance before w). Overall, the lateral shows a nearly-complete lexical restriction to verb
particles (with the exception ofdilygun 'possum', and the derivate bilybanbilyban).
There are comparable distributional restrictions on the lamino-palatal lateral in
Yangman, as far as the more limited data indicate. Also, there is in Mangarrayi a small
handful of />'-final verb particles (four have been found). And though all of these appear
to also occur in Yangman, and evidently represent an historical diffusion from that
language, inquiry indicates they are now regarded by speakers as Mangarrayi words, and
not as recognizable borrowings. The restricted distribution of this lateral can, on the basis
of the evidence, be seen as an areal phenomenon in which Mangarrayi participates
marginally.
In Wardaman, there seems to be little plausibility to the suggestion that these instances
may be viewed (historically) as combinations of / plus a high vowel IM phonetically
realized as palatalization. There are enough cases of stem-final // (e.g., mangali 'girl,
female') to make it clear that such palatalization is not, in any event, a synchronic process.
And there are attestations of word-final lyi, as in /malyi/, toponym. In contrast with the
lateral, the palatal nasal is much more common stem-finally, and is distributed over
different parts of speech (e.g., juyn 'to set' (of sun, particle), jirrangaliyn 'mud
swallow'). It, too, contrasts directly with final nyi (as in mobonyi 'night time').
There is, however, some question about analysis of both palatal sonorants
intervocalically, simply because in that position there is no clear or convincing basis for
a contrast between ly versus a combination /+ y, or between ny versus n+ y, as thereSegmental phonology 19is finally. This is true, for example, of a word for a catfish species, which could
alternatively be /ginyang/ or /ginyang/, or the word for 'echidna' which might
alternatively be represented phonemically as /gawalyan or /gawalyan/.
The question of a two-segment versus single-segment analysis may simply be said to
be irrelevant in those medial environments. There is no phonetic difference that can be
established between the two possibilities. We can show this by observing intermorphemic combinations of n + y and / + y, where the y is the initial segment of an
inflectional suffix (e.g., YI-buruwun-yi 'killer', ERG). In the text transcriptions in
practical orthography, morphemic combination is always distinguished from intramorphemic ny and ly by a hyphen at morpheme boundary.
In summary concerning word- and morpheme-final position, we note that all stops and
nasals, all the laterals, the glides /y/ and /w/, and apical /IT/ are attested, while /r/ is not.
A few examples attest to final contrast between each glide, and the combination of glide
and homorganic vowel, for example:
dawu'that way'vs.waray'ask'vs.daw

gunduyi-ma'sound sleep',
'take off'
'give hiding, belt'The set of final nasal contrasts is illustrated by:
yi-mum
gunbilin
mejern
garnbayn

'(native) doctor'
'stomach'
'type of cabbage palm'
'run'The contrast among laterals finally is exemplified by:
jil-ma
jily-ma
mirlirl-ma'company, keep company' (particle)
'wring, squeeze' (particle)
'rise' (of sun)The final contrast among stops is illustrated by:
bardab
dulwad
mardird
garnbij
gandawag'look around'
'count, enumerate'
'kite'
'clapstick'
'moon'2.4. Phonotactics: Consonant clusters
There are no morpheme-initial consonant clusters except for the very rare combination
gl, so far attested in only two forms: -gle 'putrid, rotten', and medially in the (obligatorily
reduplicative) particle lowaglowa 'play', gle- has never been found to occur20 Chapter 2word-initially, but rather is always preceded by one of the noun class prefixes (yi-gle,
wu-gle). There is also a place name wugleni 'Johnstone Hole', which might be related
etymologically to the root -gle. There is at least one instance, in a bird name, of a
particularly minimal and indistinct, if indeed organic, vocalic segment between b snarl.
This occurs in the word \jnjiirijbllrlan]' friar bird'. However, there are no other instances
suggesting the possibility of a cluster bl.
Within morphemes, combinations of apical nasal plus apical stop contrast as between
the two apical series: nd vs. rnd. As in neighbouring languages, there are no such
combinations in which the nasal and stop differ in place. The same is true for the (rare)
combinations of lateral plus apical stop (e.g., Id, which only occur at reduplicative
boundaries). The transcriptional practice adopted for the retroflex combinations is to
write the indicator of retroflexion only once, thus: rnd, rid.","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"
"10.2. Information units, given/new and theme/rheme contrasts
Halliday (1985 and earlier) suggests that two major dimensions of textual organization
in English have to do with ""information"" and ""thematisation"" (see also McGregor 1990
for application of Hallidayan concepts to the Western Australian language Gooniyandi).
Information is concerned wit ι the given/new opposition, and thematisation with the
theme/rheme, or topic/comm:nt, opposition. He further suggests that information
structure is primarily expressed prosodically, while the thematic structure is realised
through constituent order. In the previous section I suggested the importance of
considering constituency and prosody in relation to each other, in order to achieve a
descriptive scheme which delimits phrase structure and ordering possibilities within the
phrase in a meaningful way. For present purposes, I consider the use of prosodically
defined units to be one of the most helpful methodological offerings of the Halliday
framework, mainly because it provides an opening into the study of the interaction
between grammaticality and other levels of the organization of text.
Halliday (1985: 274) observes that an information unit does not correspond exactly to
any unit in the clause grammar, but other things being equal, tends to be coextensive with
one clause, as the ""default"" ccndition in English. Each information unit is realized as a
pitch contour, or TONE, which extends over the whole tone group. Within the tone group,
one foot or syllable carries thi main pitch movement, and the element which has this
feature of tonic prominence is said to carry the information focus. The tonic foot marks
where the 'new' element of information ends. Halliday (1985:277) considers information
that is presented by the speaker as recoverable as ""given"", and that which is presented
as not recoverable to be ""new"".
The Wardaman texts appended to this grammar were realized as sequences of tone units.
Each such unit is identified by number. Many are short and occupy only one line. The
main criterion for identifying ;i tone unit is on the basis that it is bounded by significant
pitch movement, either a rise or a fall. Typically, such a unit is also bounded by short226 Chapter 10pause, but the presence of pause is not in itself defining of a tone group. In some cases
it is ambiguous whether a particular stretch of speech is best identified as two tone units
or as one. This is especially the case where it appears that there may be some pitch
movement at the possible tone unit boundary, but pitch remains relatively constant
(compared to other instances). In other words, questions of identification may arise
because intonational phenomena are perceived as a matter of degree. The temptation to
identify a separate tone unit may be strengthened where there is also pause at such a
possible boundary, but as noted above, pause in itself is not definitional of the tone unit.
As McGregor (1990: 362) notes for Gooniyandi, tone units in Wardaman do not
necessarily correspond to grammatical units, although they do so in particular cases. As
has often been noted for Australian languages (and as in the Moon Dreaming text, above),
a single nominal word may frequently be found on a tone unit of its own, set apart from
other constituents to which it is meaningfully linked. Because nominal and other words
are frequently set off in this way on their own tone unit, a number of such units together
may contain the information that might otherwise be contained within a clause. At the
same time, it may often happen, as Halliday has shown for English, that a tone group will
be equivalent to a clause, as for the Moon Dreaming group ""he speared the kangaroo
with joey"". In the case of smaller constituent units which may comprise part of a clause,
I make the assumption that while whatever set of nominal words occurs on a single tone
unit may comprise (one or more) noun phrases, it is not legitimate to assume that nominal
constituents occurring in different tone groups constitute part of the same particular
phrase (although the same actual forms may occur elsewhere as part of a phrase on a
single tone group). Thus, in the above Moon Dreaming example, mangali 'female' and
wurre-warang cannot be regarded as part of the same noun phrase, even though these
two words might occur together elsewhere within a tone unit and as part of a noun phrase.
That is, I am prepared to use occurrence on a single tone unit as a minimum condition,
necessary but not sufficient, for the identification as a noun phrase of any given set of
nominal words.
Following Grimes (1975) and others, it is possible to suggest that there is a distinction
to be made between more central or primary tone units, and secondary ones (see
McGregor 1990: 364). In such a scheme, the primary unit may be defined by greater
prominence of its salient syllable, and by greater pitch movement over the contour. A
secondary unit, whatever its precise character, may be defined as in association with a
primary one, and generally characterized negatively, by lesser syllable salience and lesser
pitch movement. McGregor (1991: 365) suggests for Gooniyandi that the primary unit
normally contains the propositional nexus: the verbal complex in clauses with verbs.
Further, secondary units normally consist of a single clausal constituent: NP, adverbial,
or other. McGregor goes on to hypothesize the existence of a tonic sentence, defined as
a primary unit in association with one or more optional secondary ones. In information
terms, the secondary unit(s) tend(s) to elaborate the primary one, or otherwise convey
information closely related to that of the primary unit. I have not put this plausible
distinction between primary and secondary units to work in this description, that is, units
in the texts are not identified as primary or secondary. I would only note that the
distinction might be profitably elaborated as a set of typical primary-secondary tone unitIssues in constituency and word order 227nexus types; for example, there is a prosodic relation of dependency between the
(typically short and unelaboraied) tone units containing a ""say"" verb, and the unit(s)
which realize the reported speech which the verb projects.
There follows consideration of the constituency of the noun phrase, and in 10.8. a
summary of noun phrase structire types. This is given together with discussion of normal
ordering within the phrase. While no doubt further meaningful distinctions made by
ordering remain to be discerned, it is suggested that regular meaningful differences in
the presentation of information appear to be associated in some instances with the
difference between the orders: demonstrative determiner followed by nominal, versus
nominal followed by demonstrative determiner (DEM + N versus N + DEM). I will
propose that this difference may be seen as part of the organization of difference between
unmarked and marked Theme types, that is, less or more remarkable organization of what
any particular tone unit or sequence of them is ""about"". A further introductory word may
be useful here about the notion of theme.
Again following Halliday (1935:278-279) in his elaboration of Firthian and Pragueian
notions, thematic structure may be defined as that dimension in which is organized what
a stretch of speech is about. Theme is commonly defined as (1) the point of departure
of what the speaker has to say, or more fully, (2) what the speaker is talking about, the
topic; while Rheme is commonly defined as the completion of this point of departure, or
the comment. Obviously, the £ iven/new contrast may interact closely with the theme/
rheme one, in that, for example, it is possible for something to be presented as either an
expected or unexpected, a givei or not given, point of departure.
Finally, we will need to consider how to approach the question of the presence and
ordering of nominal constituents of clause-level syntactic function, intransitive Subject,
transitive Object, and ergative-marked Agent. It is common enough for such functions
to be marked only on the verb within any given tone unit, that is, for there to be no overt
nominal expression of any given major clause function. Some discussion of lexical
realization of these functions is thus required, because case-marking of them is obviously
dependent upon their occurrence. But beyond that, is it possible to say that an occurring
nominal typically precedes or :bllows the verb of which it is the object? To the extent
that the agent of a transitive verb is realized by a nominal expression, where does this
occur with respect to the verb1; We will see that the ergative-marked agent is the least
frequently occurring of the three syntactic types, and that there is a tendency for all three
to occur preceding the verbal word or words; but that this tendency is apparently strongest
for nouns and noun phrases in intransitive subject function, noticeable but not extreme
for ergative-marked transitive igents, and least noticeable for transitive objects, which
occur both pre- and post-verba ly with more nearly equal frequency.","[249, 250, 251]"
"2.3. Distributional restrictions: Consonants
Word-initially there is no distinctive contrast bet wee n consonants of the two apical series.
Where no vowel immediately precedes, in ordinary speech the word-initial realization
of initial apicals tends to be alveolar rather than retroflex. However, when a vowel (of
another word, or of a vowel-final inflectional prefix) immediately precedes, the steminitial norm tends to be quite strongly retroflex (but in terms of auditory impression, not
quite so much so as in some languages of the region, for example, Ngalakan). For
example:
['na.rri]
'he saw it'
[yi'rna.rri ]
'you [SG] saw it'
['climana]'horse'[y/ 'rdirdiman ] proper name, YI- class marker
Though there is no reason to recognize a word-initial contrast between the two stopnasal series, the question remains how to represent the morpheme-initial norm, as plain
alveolar, or as retroflex, or perhaps some other way which shows that there is no clear
auditory contrast except post-vocalically, and following non-nasal sonorants.
This situation, or something similar, presents itself in a number of the local languages
that have two apical series (see e.g., Merlan 1983: 9-10); that is, there is no, or in some
languages scarcely any, direct contrast between morpheme-initial alveolar and retroflex
apicals. Though the situation might be descriptively treated in a number of ways, my
preference is to regard morphemes as retroflex initial. Phonetically, the retroflex series
is relatively marked, the plain alveolar unmarked. In light of this, it is theoretically more
satisfactory to explain the lack of phonetic contrast word-initially by a neutralization in
favour of realization by the less marked series, than to treat the situation as one in which
retroflexion adds a feature to some kind of archiphonemic segment in the post-vocalic
environment (following a vowel-final prefix).
However, a practical cost is associated with the decision to treat morphemes as retroflex
initial. Usage in most of this description, as is otherwise common, is to represent retroflex
segments in practical orthography by a digraph consisting of r plus a letter designating
the rest of the segment (e.g., rd for the apical stop, etc.). It is daunting to write the r
morpheme initially, a procedure which results in forms like rdagbarla 'keep it', and
rnarri 'he/she saw it'. Therefore in practical transcription, lexeme-initial apicals will
be represented without initial r. This practice is extended to phonetic environments in
which retroflexion is quite pronounced, as after vowel-final prefixes (e.g., nga-nam Ί
saw it'). This makes it necessary for anyone reading this transcription to keep in mind
that, following vowel-final prefixes and elsewhere post-vocalically, the pronunciation of
initial apical consonants of lexical stems is with a significant degree of retroflexion.",[40]

12.3.3. Ngala 'but'
The next two conjunctions to be discussed fall into the Halliday and Hasan category of
""adversative"". That is, the kind of linkage they express is that something following is
disjunct or different from something that has gone before. (In 12.2.1. we saw that the
particle bajawinyin usually seems to have an adversative nuance.) The first conjunction
of this kind to be discussed here is the stronger of the two, and is best glossed in most of
its uses as ""but"", but as examples will show, the disjunction need not be quite as radical
as that ordinarily signalled by English ""but"". It is usually clause-initial.

"10.9. Variant ordering in DEM + N phrases
In 10.3 it was said that the most common ordering of demonstrative and specified noun
is DEM + N. It was also noted that such phrases containing the forms of the Proximate
demonstrative nana are of particularly high frequency, since that category has the
function of signaling the textual recoverability of the entity, and is perhaps most
comparable to the English definite article (see 7.2. for illustration). But recoverability in
general does not completely coincide with the identification in context of which
particular recoverable entity is being referred to. Let us consider some instances of the
variant order with the Proximate category, N + DEM, since it would appear to be
associated with and one of the means of clarifying which recoverable or given noun
phrase within the information unit is meant, by signalling a break in the flow.
In certain instances where two protagonists have been spoken about, the variant order
seems to be associated with a shift from one to the other.
In the Onion text, line 65 we have an instance of marluga nana. Two men have been
discussing the illness of one of them who ate food prepared by two girls. The other man
suggests to him that he has been ensorcelled, and he agrees. ""I dreamt about them"" (63),
""about the two of them giving me onion, he says"" (64). At that point the other old man
calls out to the girls and tells them to rub the victim with fat. It is at that point in line
(65) that the phrase in question occurs, and appears to be associated with a transition
from the speaker quoting the victim, to the other old man asserting his authority over the
girls and telling them to cure him. Note that the ""other"" old man re-introduced at this
point is grammatically the subject of an intransitive verb (""call to"") which takes dative
complement.
In the text Mejern, between lines (93) and (98) there is a similar shift in transition
between two recoverable characters. An old Aboriginal man identified as the father of246 Chapter 10Micky Bennett was hiding along the river (92) and saw a white man shooting Aborigines
(93). For several dozen lines the speaker has been talking about shooting by whites, not
individually identifiable but only known as associated with local stations. A chief interest
of this part of the story is the identifiability of particular Aborigines and their exploits in
the face of European violence. Having seen the white (or whites) shooting (93), the old
Aboriginal man spears his horse out from under him (94-97), and he falls. Line (98)
begins with the variant order memden nana, perhaps associated with the transition from
the previous few lines in which the old Aboriginal man is the assumed agent (ellipsed in
97). A similar shift occurs between about lines (99) and (104). In (99), the old Aborigine
runs up to the white and stabs him, ""with a tommyhawk"" (100), ""stab"" (101), and runs
away up on top (of the hills) (102-103). Line 104 says: mernden nana gud gajurri 'the
white man stood up'. That is, both are recoverable as nana signals, but I hypothesize that
the variant order may be associated with the signalling of a shift among recoverable items,
specifically to one that has receded slightly into the narrative background.","[269, 270]"
"4.2. Nominals: Pronouns, nouns, demonstratives, and
interrogatives
""Nominal"" is the cover term used for a broad class of lexical items which can inflect for
case and certain other categories. Within the class of nominals, several sub-classes will
be identified. The syntactic patterning of all sub-classes tends to be Ergative-Absolutive
where there is an object marked on the verb (even if 3SG zero), but occasional instances
are found in text in which transitive agent nominals are not Ergative-marked.
Pronouns are those nominals which refer to speech-situation participants, and some
which can index (emphatically, anaphorically) other nominals. There are many formal
similarities between the independent pronominal stems, and the affixal pronominal forms
obligatorily prefixed to the verb to indicate participant identities.
Demonstrative pronouns are a nominal sub-class which make reference in terms of
graded distance or location categories calibrated primarily in relation to the speech
situation (there are three such degrees marked by Wardaman demonstrative morphology,
and a whole host of formally related terms, ""this side"", ""that side"", etc.). One term in the
three-term spatial system, called Proximate, also serves to indicate textual recoverability.
Its forms are thus far more frequent than are those of the other two demonstrative
categories.
Interrogative pronouns are nominals with which different kinds of questions are
formed: ""what"", ""where"", ""who"". Secondarily, they function in the construction of
negative and indefinite arguments (""nobody"", ""somebody"").
Number words belong to the class of nominals. There are three numbers, lege One',
guyamin 'two', and murrgun 'three'. Beyond that ngawurnen indicates 'many, a large
number'. Number words may function as modifiers, or as noun phrase heads in their own
right.
Finally, there is a large class that will simply be called ""nominals"" in general, but which
comprehends what would be called ""nouns"" and ""adjectives"" in conventional part-of-58 Chapter 4speech terms. In dictionary entries and glosses, for the most part a distinction has been
made between the former (""N"") and the latter (""NADJ"")· This is not because the
distinction can be satisfactorily sustained for all purposes (see below), but because it
partly captures some distributional and functional differences within the class.
Some nominals, the notionally more adjectival ones like ""empty"", ""tough"", ""raw""
""crooked"", ""long"", ""good"" and so on, are more likely to function predicatively than are
what might be called argument nominals such as ""goanna"" (lizard),""woman"", and ""duly
bag"" (string bag). The more adjectival are regularly causativized and inchoativized,
while the argument nominals are not regularly so treated. Here, however, the distinction
is not absolute, for some of them which might be considered towards the attributive end
of a nominal-feature spectrum, and also some which designate persons in terms of agestatuses, for example, are found to be so treated. For example, a noun which typically
occurs as argument, meaning such things as ""plain, flat place"" (as opposed to ""flat"" in
general), may be causativized. A noun such as ""man"" may, also. Finally, the more
adjectival are commonly found in modifying function, while the others are not.
While a degree of distinctiveness thus can be identified between notionally adjectival
and other nominals, in Wardaman as in many other Australian languages (and regional
ones, including Wardaman's putative congeners, see Cook 1987: 88), the formerare not
limited to predicative and modifying functions, but also regularly function as arguments.
In Wardaman, their functioning as arguments is implemented with the help of the overt
nominal class markers which are prefixed to nominals of the adjectival sort, and create
forms the general kind of reference of which is indicated by the class marker, and the
more specific denotation of which is understood in terms of the ""property-like""
designation of the adjectival stem. Such forms may function syntactically as modifiers,
but equally, they may function as arguments in their own right. The difference between
the two different notional types is fluid enough so that stems of the more adjectival kind,
class-prefixed, may come to be regular designators of (kinds of) referents which have
the particular property. For example, the adjectival stem barnbamin means 'naked,
hairless'; with animate class prefix, the formyi-barnbarnin is used to mean 'buffalo'. To
give a second example, the adjectival stem langman means 'clear, cleared'; with class
prefix, the form wu-langman is taken to mean 'clear space, clear area', and case-inflected
forms of it are commonly used without any (other) argument noun, e.g., wu-langma-warr
'to a clearing, clear place' (allative-marked).
Another general difference between notionally ""argument"" and adjectival nominals is
that most of the former tend to regularly occur with only one class prefix (if any, for there
are argument nouns like bangbun 'woman' which never take overt class prefix). For
example, most body parts take the class prefix yi-, and tend to occur only with that prefix,
not with any other. On the other hand, most of the notionally adjectival nominals may
be freely prefixed with the range of class markers, something which changes their
understood designation. There are some indeterminacies here too, however (see 5.1. for
more detail), so relatively fixed versus variable class-marking of nominals can only be
taken as a general guide. The point in distinguishing between N and NADJ at all is not
to saddle the language with untenable distinctions, but rather to try to capture some of
the privilege-of-occurrence tendencies which are evident in Wardaman.","[81, 82]"
"Process phonology 27Though there are no geminate clusters in lexical stems, common processes of
morpheme combination result in geminate clusters across boundaries. One of those
boundaries is that between verb particle, and the particle suffix of shape -ma or -ba
(11.1.2.). Following stops, hardening accounts for the stop-initial shape -ba. Where this
follows a particle ending in -b, the cluster b- b arises (lub-ba 'grab'). Where the
particle-suffix follows a particle ending in m, the cluster m-m arises (lom-ma 'peel').
This boundary may be considered morpho-phonologically more external than certain
others (see 3.5.1.), partly on the basis that degemination is facultative, though usual, here:
instances where degemination does not occur are found throughout my data. Failure to
occur was recognizable in one of two ways: as a distinction between two articulations,
or (more commonly) not completely distinct articulations but slightly greater length in
the holding of the articulatory position, e.g., \jub:a] 'shut', a particle which is
alternatively realized as \juba] (orjub, without suffix).
The combination g-g across morpheme boundaries arises from certain frequent
morpheme combinations: the suffixation to stem ending in -g (see 3.4.) of the post-stop
dative allomorph -gu, dissociative allomorph -gunya, of ""having"" suffixal allomorph
-garang, of allative allomorph -garr, and so on (e.g., allative-suffixed form of stem
goyog- 'bitter, salty' is goyog-garr, normally simplified to goyogarr. This boundary
must be considered different from that discussed above between particle and suffix, in
that geminate clusters are not found here.
Degemination may be stated informally: that wherever a cluster of two identical stops
or nasals occurs, it tends to be reduced, but is not necessarily reduced at the particle-suffix
boundary. As mentioned, in 3.5.1., it will be seen that the cluster dd invariably reduces,
at the boundary between pronominal prefix and verb root; and that clusters of jj which
may arise at nominal stem and suffix boundary also reduce. Clusters of both kinds arise
from other processes which remain to be discussed; relevant to the rise of jj clusters is
the process of final syllable reduction in nominal stems (3.4.), which may leavey stemfinal. So far, the evidence suggests that only two boundary types are needed to account
for invariable versus facultative degemination. These will be represented, wherever it is
useful to distinguish them, as ~ (where degemination is facultative) and / (invariant
degemination).
Now let us return to the question of underlying sequences of nn in the pronominal prefix
forms to the verb.
In a small number of prefixes, it appears plausible and formally justifiable, by analogy
with other forms, to posit an underlying prefix structure which contains instances ofn-n,
where the first is an accusative marker within the prefix paradigm, the second, the initial
sonorant of a small number of«- initial pronominal prefixes which may occur following
the accusative marker. In all these forms, only a single n is realized, and so we may
assume a process of reduction. Examples of such forms are: 2SG
> 1NSG (second
person singular acting on first person nonsingular, see 6.6.2) /yi-n-gu-n-ni-/, to be
analyzed as 1 Exclusive marker, accusative, plural marker, accusative, 2SG; surface form
yin.gini-; 2NSG
> 1NSG /yi-n-gu-n-nu-/ (1EX, accusative, plural marker,
accusative, 2 person), with actual form yunggunu-. This posited degemination is28 Chaptersrestricted to the pronominal prefixes; for as we shall see (3.4.1.), where prefix-final n
precedes verb stem initial n, a different set of phonological processes occurs.","[50, 51, 52]"
"7.5.8. Indefinite suffix -warda
Another suffix which contributes a slightly different tone than -gula and -gan is -\varda.
This cannot be properly described as just an interrogative suffix, although it is very
common with interrogative words and phrases. It is a more general flavouring element
of the ""interpersonal"" dimension, and expresses either broad and slightly querulous
interrogation of the ""what in the world?"" kind (i.e., which suggests that the event or thing
is unusual, there may be a wide, unforeseen range of possible answers, and the like), and
often (with non-interrogative elements) a tone of exasperation or end-of-tether. Where
it leaves open a wide range of possibilities, it is often best translated indefinitely,
""somewhere/something-or-other"", and the like. A sizeable set of examples is given to
help establish the range of this suffix. Note from some of these that -warda is final,
occurring after any non-zero nominal or other affixes.

"Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 271A similar meaning would be expressed by the subordinate verb form without suffix;
but its addition seems to focus on simultaneity of the two actions or conditions expressed
by the predicates of clauses so linked. The suffix may be added to finite verb forms:
(655)nga-njigbe-warra
ISG-go-FUT-ADVnana
that-ABSya-0-nyangi-we
3-3SG-come-FUTyiwarna-gari
other-other'When I will go the other fellow will come'.
The same suffix is added to verb particles, and these function as clause complements:
(1) designating the time at which something took place; or (2) as secondary predicates
with verbs of motion, the kind of action undertaken during or as a result ofthat motion.
In the first usage, the suffix is added to particles designating events, for example:
(656)lilg-ba-warra
dryup-ADVbarrunin
fish-ABSlag
dessicate0-ngegba-rri
3SG-AUX-PST'When it [water] dried, the fish died and dried up'.
The particle lilg-ba is usually combined with ya- to mean 'dry up', and is often used
in reference to seasonal drying up of water bodies. Such minimal temporal complements
as these differ little from nominals designating seasons and conditions, similarly suffixed,
e.g., wu-jerrij-barra 'when it is cold, in cold-weather time'.
As secondary predicates with verbs of motion, the complement clause may have a
Dative, semantically direct object, and further nominal complements are also Dative
marked. Common in this function is the particle gej-(ba) 'ask'; as clausal predicate with
finite verb gi~ it takes a direct (animate) object, the person asked.

"10.6. The negated noun phrase
One of the most commonly heard words in Wardaman is ngawun 'nothing, none'. One
man of my acquaintance was in fact called by the nickname ""Ngawun"", because
whenever anybody asked him for anything they could be sure of his answer. However,
ngawun is an interjection. The particle which most commonly negates the noun or noun
phrase is wonggo, or secondarily warna. These always precede that which they negate
(see 12.2.5.).

"10.7. Discontinuous constituency
There are numerous examples in which nominal constituents of groups which occur on
a single tone unit, and might be on semantic and syntactic grounds analyzed as members
of a single noun phrase, nevertheless occur separated from each other, sometimes by a
number of words.
(593)oni
majadmajad
[only] MA-big-rdp-ABSyirr-me-ndi-ya
lEXNSG-get-PST-NARmayin
food-ABS'We only got big tubers'.
From the preceding context, ""vegetable food"" seems to be presupposed, while ""big""
appears to be contrastive with ""little ones"" (vegetables) of the preceding tone group. In
the next example, wu-jad 'big' modifies yibumbu 'billycan':
(594) yibumbu
billy-ABSyanima-n joy nganburr-wo-ndi-ya-wuya
thus-ABS give 3NSG/lSG-give-PST-NAR-DUwu-jad
WU-big-ABS'They gave me a big billycan like this'.
Here, in context, the information focus appears to be on the deictic ""like this"", and
generally, on the size of the billycan, further expressed by the qualifier in final position.
In the following tone unit the billycan is further described, by an adjectival nominal set
off on its own tone, as ""clean"".
In the next example, yidinen-bi 'whole' modifies the earlier occurring lege walanja
One goanna':
(595) lege
one-ABSwalanja
goanna-ABSnga-ga-ndi
ISG-take-PSTgo
yidinen-bi
3SG-DAT whole-ARTΊ took one goanna for him whole'.
In this context, the referent ""goanna"" appears to be considered recoverable, and was
explicitly mentioned in the previous tone group. What seems to be presented as salient
is that, on one occasion, the speaker took back a whole goanna for her father.
(596) ma-garlarl
MA-clean-ABS0-we-ndi-ya
3SG-fall-PST-NARma-nyeyn
MA-body-ABS'The vegetable matter fell down clean'/ 'the clean vegetable matter fell down'.
In context, a contrast is being made between the ""body"" which falls away clean after
winnowing, and the skin (mentioned in first position in the following tone unit) which242 Chapter 10must be put to one side. The focus appears to be on ""flesh"" and ultimately the contrast
between ""flesh"" and ""skin"".
(597) ma-jad
MA-big-ABSwurr-nwrnbu-rri-ya
3NSG-make-PST-NARmayin
food-ABSyanima-n
thus-ABS'They made a big loaf of it like this'.
In context, the speaker has referred to vegetable paste from which she says a big loaf
(mayin)' like this' is made. The focus of information appears to be on the nature and size
of the loaf, and perhaps particularly on the deictic ""like this"".
(598) wwren
child-ABS0-dagbarla-rri
3SG-have-PSTwudu
little-ABS'She had a little child'.
This tone unit occurs early in a narration (Gawalyan 2) in which very little is
presupposed; only gawalyan 'porcupine' has been mentioned as protagonist in the
preceding tone unit.
Questions arise about the textual significance of such preferred constructions, and
possible constituent analysis of them. It would seem that the earlier-occurring lexemes
are part of what each tone group as a whole ""is about"", or constitute part of the theme,
in that sense, of each. However, those lexemes in first position generally seem, in context,
to be less a focus of the information unit as a whole than other later-occurring elements
with which they are cohesive. As the above examples suggest, the nominal prefix system
of Wardaman may play a particular role in making explicit the link between such
discontinous elements. In general terms, my hypothesis is that this is a kind of
discontinuity which breaks up a larger theme into parts, the earlier (at least in general, if
not in every case) through this presentation rendered as more fully presupposed, the later
as more in-focus for one reason or another e.g., because it is contrastive, or otherwise the
less presupposable element of the theme as a whole.
Are such constructions to be analyzed as one phrase or two? All of those illustrated
occur on a single tone unit, and we have hypothesized above that the discontinuity plays
a role in distributing information over that unit, representing an intersection of Theme
with Given/New contrasts. Partly because these constructions occur on a single tone
unit, I provisionally regard each one as a single noun phrase, and the discontinuity as as
a way in which more highly presupposable (but not completely given and ellipsable)
nominal reference is carried through the text. The common reference of both parts
reinforces the identification of participants, but distribution of information into two parts
allows one to be presented as more highly presupposed than the other, and (generally)
less highly contrastive with surrounding nominal expressions. Where information is
distributed discontinuously in this way, first position appears to be more strongly
associated with more highly presupposed thematic elements, final position with those
that are less so.","[265, 266]"

(301) occurred in the context of a night-time recording session in which the speaker
was recounting some events in relation to which she wanted to recall the name of a
particular old man. She knew the old man had been named (to the writer) the previous
night, and this is presumably the feeling-tone in terms of which -gula may be understood
here, that is: you all know who I'm trying to name, say it!
Although -gula is almost always found suffixed to interrogative words and phrases,
there are instances which appear to be emphatic but not necessarily interrogative, e.g.,
(302)banggin-gula
back-ABS-EMPHya-wurr-(y)uju
3-3NSG-AUXngojgoj-ba
ache/be stiff'Their backs ache!'.
In this sense -gula appears similar if not identical in its meaning contribution to another
emphatic suffix -ga (see 12.4.3.).
7.5.7. Question suffix -gan
A relatively milder and extremely common interrogative suffix is -gan. By ""milder"" is
meant that its feeling-tone is such that the speaker appears more to be inquiring of himself
or herself, rather than intrusively trying to elicit a response from an interlocutor. This
quality is no doubt linked to the fact that forms with -gan are often of the ""whatchamacallit"" sort, in which the speaker is seeking to remember something, but is searching for
the missing item himself or herself, and not really expecting anyone else to supply it.
Distributionally, too, -gan differs from -gula in that it may be followed by grammatical
affixes (case-suffixes, etc.), in which case inflections are added to the form -ga-. -gan
forms are most common with ngamanda 'what', yinggiya 'who', and also with the mode

"12 Chapter 2Word-finally, the palatal digraphs are inverted (ly is written as yl, and ny as yn),
because this seems to make it easier for those who already read English to approximate
the correct pronunciation.
In Wardaman, the bilabial series involves true bilabial occlusion.
In the apico-alveolar series, the active articulator is the tip of the tongue making contact
with the alveolar ridge. For the apico-domal or retroflex consonants, the active
articulator is the apex making contact in the pre-palatal region. It can be difficult to
distinguish phonetically between members of the two apical series, especially
intervocalically. Here, even what turn out, upon close investigation, to be plain apical
consonants, may occasionally have a hint of retroflex vocoid on-glide. Also, what turn
out to be retroflex segments are often realized with relatively little phonetic retroflexion,
and this appears to be true in any position. Thus the apical series, across their realizations,
tend to be more similar to each other than in some other languages of the region. Despite
the problems sometimes posed by identification of the difference between corresponding
members of the two series, and even despite a certain tendency towards harmonic
phonetic ""spread"" of retroflexion to other apical consonants in the word following a
retroflex one (perhaps similar to a phenomenon identified in Wakiman by Cook 1987:
26-29, see 3.7.3.), there can be no doubt of the phonological status of the distinction in
Wardaman.
For the production of lamino-palatals, the tongue is laterally spread, with the tip of the
tongue touching the back of the lower teeth, the blade the alveo-palatal region. Lateral
spread of the tongue is particularly noticeable in the (rather rare) realizations of the
lamino-palatal lateral ly before peripheral stops and glides. All three laterals are voiced
bilateral approximants.
The velar series is dorso-palatal.
Of the two rhotics, the apico-alveolar /rr/ is a tap, never a trill. The glide Irl is a postalveolar approxirnant. There is no question of the phonemic distinctness or positional
neutralization of the rhotic contrast in Wardaman, Yangman, and Dagoman. But here
again a signal difference with Wakiman must be noted: there, the rhotic contrast
minimally distinguishes few forms, and the tap rhotic in that language has a variant which
is phonetically indistinguishable from the post-alveolar glide (Cook 1987: 29).
/w/ is a voiced bilabial frictionless continuant, with rounding noticeable before /u/ and
Ιοί. However, before /u/ in the noun class prefix /wu/, there may be very little to no
noticeable lip-rounding or protrusion, such that the realization of this sequence is [u].
Likewise, the voiced vocoid /y/, normally produced with considerable lateral tongue
spread and approximation of blade and mid-tongue to palate, may exhibit a minimal
degree of these articulatory features word-initially before the high front III. This is
frequently the case in the realization of the higher animate noun class prefix /yi/, as [/'],
but much less so of pre-/i/ realizations elsewhere (e.g., in such words as yilgbayi 'all
right, enough'). The correct generalization seems to be that where the conditions are met
for higher and tenser realization of/i/, there may be minimal realization of the semivowel.
Where, however, (as in yilgbayi, with its closed first syllable), there is [/] realization of
the vowel, there tends to be fuller realization of the semivowel. And it is precisely in its
morpho-phonological occurrences as noun class prefix that the former conditions (forSegmental phonology 13higher and tenser realization of the vowel, see below on vowel allophony) are most often
met. Since there is no other compelling evidence for a contrast between /yi/ and /i/
morpheme-initially, nor, indeed, any independent evidence for vowel-initial morphemes
(save one α-initial one) in the language, this can apparently be treated as a specialization
in the noun class morphemes.
The vowel /i/ is realized as a high, front, maximally tense [/] in open syllables, and
particularly before the palatal segments /j/, /ny/, /ly/, both semivowels, and also the rhotic
/rr/, as in the following examples (in some, more than one condition is met):
[ 'warrija ]
[ 'lidi ]
[li'warrga ]
[ 'girrgilang ]
f 'ginyang ]
[ 'ginydan ]'alligator'
'long-horned grasshopper'
'ground sugar bag'
'galah'
catfish species
'stone spear point'In the last form above, the high and tense vowel quality is the main auditory cue
signalling the palatal articulation of the following nasal, which before the stop normally
evidences no palatal off-glide.
The /i/ vowel is realized as slightly lower and less tense in closed syllables:
[ 'munln ]
[ 'mardlrd ]
[yllg'bayi]'rock cod'
'whistling kite'
OK, enough'There are morphemes with phonetic long [/':], sometimes also realized as a diphthong
[if]. This appears to be best regarded as the sequence /iyi/, which can be shown to contrast
with /i/ in an otherwise very similar environment. The following two forms illustrate
this contrast between such a long vowel, and a fairly high, tense but short /i/:
\ji:la}
\jila ]'well'
originative suffix/jiyila/
/jila/There are other examples for which no minimally or sub-minimally distinct form can
be cited, e.g., [bi:marla], /biyimarla/ 'inflate'.
There is a parallel to the above in the length of the vowel, and syllable reduction, in the
verb particle [du:], also realized as [duU] 'to raise' (with auxiliary bu-), in the noun [lu:n]
'cave', in the noun [ngu:n] 'faeces', in the particle [buUdba] 'cook under ashes', the
noun stem [muUdban] 'wet soil'. In all cases we must recognize the combination of
/uwu/ in accounting for the phonetic length of the vowel: /duwu/, /luwun/, /nguwun/,
/buwud-ba/, /mu-wudban/ (the latter apparently with nominal class marker showing fixed
assimilation to the first stem vowel).
In contrast with the above V\ + homorganic glide + Vi sequences, combinations with
vowel and heterorganic glide, [iwi] and [uyu], tend to remain clearly syllabified, or may
be only slightly reduced ([yi-ngawuyu] 'wife', [miwinin] 'camp, sleep').","[35, 36, 37]"
"The second kind of function is not ""response"" either in the immediate speech situation
or in a narrated one, but is a way in which the speaker carries the narrative flow forward
and creates cohesion within the text.

"1.3. Linguistic type
Wardaman is both prefixing and suffixing. It has relatively complex nominal and verbal
morphology. There are three overt nominal class markers (yi-, ma- and WM-), at least the
first two of which are used to designate fairly unified sets of denotata. Most noun stems
occur only with prefix of one particular class (e.g., yi-biyan 'man, person, Aborigine');
but some may occur with more than one, producing lexical difference (yi-mum 'eye',
wu-mum 'nipple'). As well, there are many nouns which occur without prefix (i.e., with
0- prefix), but with which modifiers (adjectival nouns) may exhibit overt concord.
Number and case are marked by suffixes, and the syntactic case system tends to be
fairly strongly Ergative-Absolutive. However, there is wide use of a clause type with
actor subject (not generally Ergatively-marked if represented by an independent
nominal), and objective complement marked by Dative case. As well, there are various
one-place (fully intransitive) clause types. Overt suffix categories include
Ergative/Instrumental, Dative/ Genitive, local cases Allative, Locative and Ablative, and
the semantically most restricted local category, Originative. In addition, there are two
morphologically composite case categories, historically built on the Dative. The first,
an historical composite of Dative plus Locative, is termed Dissociative, and usually
expresses the meaning ""from"" or ""away from"" of an animate participant, or ""on account
of of a wider range of participant types. The second, historical composite of Dative and
Ablative, expresses a range of notions including source and cause, and is labelled Source.
Participants are obligatorily marked by pronominal prefixes in the verb, and
secondarily by independent pronouns. A maximum of two participants are indicated in
the verb by transitive prefix forms that tend to be portmanteaux, i.e., not neatly
segmentable into parts representing each person/number that enters into the combination.
In the expression of verbal meanings, there is a basic distinction between inflecting
verbs and what I have called free verb ""particles"". It is common in linguistic descriptions
for the word ""particle"" to be used to designate non-inflecting parts of speech. In
Wardaman what I call ""particles"" can take some inflections. The term ""particle"" in this
sense, however, has had currency in Australianist studies for some time (see Dixon ed.
1976), and I retain it, but place emphasis on describing the possibilities of inflection, and
the important syntactic functions of these elements. ""Verb particles"" are semantically
full, and occur in combination with a small number of high-frequency inflecting roots
(including a number of significant ones of shape CV). Where such particle and verb
combinations are highly regular in a specific verbal meaning, the construction is
generally labelled that of Particle plus Auxiliary in this description. However, it isIntroduction 5significant that here, seemingly more than in some other regional languages which have
this general construction type (e.g., Mangarrayi), the ""AUX"" often transparently has
some clear semantic commonality with the particle, and thus cannot be regarded simply
as a formal mechanism or bearer of inflections. For example, with the particle gayardung
'run', most common are the motion verbs ya- 'go' and nyanga- 'come'. These of course
partly function as grammatical ""auxiliaries"", in that they bear person and verbal
categorial inflections; but transparently, they are semantically integral with the particle.
The clear kind of semantic integration in this case contrasts with that, say, between the
particle wululu and its usual ""AUX"" we-, which may occur by itself in the meaning 'fall,
be born'. However, together, the combination wululu we- means 'enter, go inside' (not
""fall in"" or the like). That is, there is no clear semantic ""transparency"" of the AUX in
the latter case, and thus a greater idiomaticity to the combination than to those with
gayardung. Thus, the label Particle plus AUX is applied to combinations which may
differ considerably in their internal semantic relations. The diverse nature of
combinations within this construction type is clearly of comparative interest, and this
labelling should not by any means disguise the fact that, as noted above, ""AUX"" is a
semantically and functionally flexible, diverse and problematic category.
Particles have a wide syntactic range. They may be inflected for nominal categories
(case), and occur in non-predicative construction types as nominals, and as modifiers.
Paradigms of inflecting verbs tend to be highly regular: there is a very limited amount
of suffixal allomorphy for tense/aspect/mood categories. The one thoroughly irregular
paradigm is that of the verb ""to go"".
Suffixal categories of the verb include Present, Past, Future, and Potential, that is,
express tense and in some instances, tense/mood meanings. An Admonitive (""lest"")
construction is generally built on a zero-stem form, or is built on the Future stem in the
few verbs where this is a formally distinct (and obviously historically moribund)
category. Further tense/aspect meanings (e.g., iterative) are expressed by additional
suffixation to verb forms inflected for tense/aspect, and in some instances (Habitual) by
special prefix forms.
A basic mood distinction between Realis and Irrealis categories is expressed by verbal
prefixation, in combination (in some instances) with differences in the bound pronominal
forms which express person/number as between the two mood categories.
Weak subordination of one predication to another is a common means of constructing
discourse linkage in Wardaman. There are two sets of subordinators, one expressing
non-past, the other past, temporal reference. Another important mechanism of textual
cohesion is ""de-focusing"" of overtly occurring NPs, i.e., marking of them as recoverable
and thus cohesive with surrounding linguistic context.
Three deictic ""degrees"" are distinguished in the demonstrative system, with some
irregularity in the paradigms. The spatially intermediate category (not ""this""and not
""yonder"", but proximate ""that"") also serves to indicate textual recoverability, and is thus
most closely comparable to the English definite article.
There are five main points of articulation of parallel stop-nasal series: labial, apicoalveolar, apico-domal or retroflex, lamino-palatal, and velar. There are laterals at three
of these points of articulation, apico-alveolar, apico-domal, and lamino-palatal. The6 Chapter 1lamino-palatal lateral has a very limited distribution. There are retroflex glide and tap
alveolar rhotics. While there are five vowels /, e, u, o and a, the mid-vowels do not
occur in any of the inflectional morphology, except as the result of low-level assimilatory
processes. The mid-vowels do, however, occur in a small number of important
derivational morphemes, and they occur freely in the wider lexicon.
There are no vowel clusters in Wardaman, and no vowel-initial morphemes besides the
tag-question particle ale 'isn't that so?'.
There appears to be little intra-language variation, but minor differences in a few lexical
items were noted among speakers.
Like Warlmanpa to the south (see Nash 1990), Wardaman speak of different territorial
sub-groupings, to which recruitment is normatively in the male line, as having different
madin 'languages', or 'words'. Each such identifiable grouping is said to have
minimally one, sometimes more, special words that are ""their"" language. Typically, these
are said to be either the sound made by, or the language spoken by, principal mythological
figures saliently associated with given Wardaman sub-territories. For example, an
important mythological association with the sub-country just west of Willeroo Station
homestead running westerly to Garnawala (Mount Hogarth) is gulirrida 'peewees',
which are abundantly represented in some of the spectacular rock paintings in this area.
The ""language"" or ""word"" of the peewees, and therefore of the grouping of people
patrifiliated to this area, is said to be mamundajgani, a form for which no etymology can
be given. A few of the ""words"" for particular sub-groupings may have etymologies in
other languages of the Victoria River area. At least one is clearly onomatopoetic (e.g.,
standardization of a bird cry). Knowledge of this kind of relation among people, territory
and salient ""word"" or ""words"" is limited to older people. The madin 'words' about which
there appeared to be wide agreement were: mamundajgani, cited above; ngagandoroj,
the ""word'Of menngen 'white cockatoo', a major dreaming around the Innesvale Station
homestead area; yidabu and wamanga, words associated with warrija 'crocodile'
dreaming, localized at Mt. Gregory; and nenene, a ""word' (imitative of a bird cry) of
bulyan 'eagle', associated with Jalad, or Price's Creek, area. The words associated with
""crocodile"" are interesting, and either have etymologies in other Victoria River
languages, or apparently in any case connote the meanings ""beef, meat"" and ""hit, strike""
(Wardaman deb 'hit, belt' was used to gloss wamanga), both principal elements of the
myth associated with Mt. Gregory, the principal characters of which, Warrura and
Barnangga, fought over a catch of crocodile. In addition, a dilygun 'possum' dreaming
associated with the high country along Mathison Creek is characterized by a particular
style of speaking, with stopped nasal segments similar to the speech of a person trying
to talk with a blocked nose. Thus, possum says dadadi instead of danani 'this one'.
Asked about these ""languages"" or ""words"", people will emphasize that they are all ""one"",
the ""same Wardaman"", that is, are socio-territorial distinctions made by people who share
a common language in the linguist's usual sense.
Among other systems of social relationship, Wardaman people recognize several
(equatable) sets of subsection (or ""eight-class"") terms, but identify only one of these as
""proper"" Wardaman. That set is given in 5.13. They also recognize matrifiliatively
transmitted recruitment to groupings commonly called ngurlu across the Victoria RiverIntroduction 7region. These groupings are not localized. Among my Wardaman informants, most
belonged to one or other of the ngurlu: goyin 'sugarbag', ganben 'flying fox', warrag
'catfish', yiburu 'black rain', and yiwaganga 'rain'. While some of these are specifically
Wardaman words (e.g., goyin), certain of the names (e.g., yiburu) have wider currency
across the region, and cannot be considered only Wardaman.","[28, 29, 30, 31]"
"Categories of the finite verb 213For example, as noted in 5.7., semantically adjectival nominate may occur with article
suffix forming complements, the subject of which is understood from the pronominal
adjunct of a proximate finite verb:
(512)wudu-wi
little-ABS-ARTnganburr-ga-ndi...
3NSG/lSG-take-PST'When I was little they took me ...'
The verb yu- is less common tYianjingi-, both in predications of being and existence
(in a place), and in particle plus verb combinations. This is related to its being defective.
As noted in 8.16., it has only present tense form yu- and non-past subordinate form
yungga, forms ofjingi- occurring elsewhere. It also has a reduplicative present tense
form, yuju-. Besides serving (rarely) as copula, yu-, is also found as supporting verb in
a number of particle plus finite verb combinations. Any particle which may occur with
yu- may also occur withy wg/-, although certain particles (see below) preferentially occur
with yu- in the Present tense. In a few combinations with particle it seems that the verb
may sometimes express the meaning of ""lie"", or (with inanimate clausal subjects) ""be on
the ground"", but this semantic element is certainly not evident in many combinations.
Particles with which yu- has been recorded in combination include: geleng 'shine, be
shiny'; lirrngang-ma 'smile, laugh'; mengmeng-ma 'be an expanse, spread out, cover,
be in flower' (typically used of expanses of water or flat plains, and in the last sense of
plants); mirrng-ma 'have a headache'; ngarralang-ma 'stand poised, with paws up';

Other aspects of word formation9.1. Introduction: Historical layers
There remain a few significant aspects of word, and mainly nominal, morphology to be
discussed in this chapter. Some of these are isolated, or attested in only a few forms (like
the prefix nya-, see 9.6.), and may be assumed to be remnants of old processes of word
formation, now fairly marginal. Others, however, like nominal formation with the suffix
•ban ~ -man, are not only clearly old, but were thorough-going in the language, as the
large number of relatable forms attests.9.2. -ban ~ -war/, adjectival suffix
A nominal-forming suffix of reasonably frequent occurrence is -ban ~ -wan, which is
attested suffixed both to verb particles/adverbs and to nominals, creating derived forms
which are either semantically adjectival, and/or characterized by perfective passive
meaning. This ending is only moderately productive.
Some forms with this suffix include: burrgburrg-bari 'piebald, spotted'; nyabnyab(b)ari 'sticky' (from nyab); walig-bari 'around, all around' (from adverbial walig
'around'); gorlorlogba-wari 'straight' (related to gorlorlogba 'straight'); gun.garr-wari
'what type?' 'what kind?' (cf. gun.garr-ma, 7.5.5.); derrema-wari 'crawling, crawler'
from the particle derre-ma; and yarralma-wari 'untidy, unkempt' (related to particle
yarralma, 'stand up, be unkempt, untidy').
Sometimes the suffix derives a form of a different word class from the base form, e.g.,
nyabnyab-(b)ari 'sticky' is derived from particle nyab-(b)a 'to stick to'; and yarralmawari 'unkempt' from particle yarralma 'to be unkempt'. However, sometimes
suffixation does not clearly result in a change in word class, e.g., compare:
(517a)walig
around(517b)walig-bari
around-NOMyanja
3SG-go-PRESgunya
3SG-DISSyanja
3SG-go-PRESye-0-geng-ma
3-3SG-fear-PRESgunya
3SG-DISSye-0-geng-ma
3-3SG-fear-PRES'He's going around away from him, he fears him'.
In such instances there is little clear ground for describing the suffix as ""nominalizing""
(or indeed, as ""derivational""), since the resulting form has the same possibilities of
occurrence as the base form. Note also gorlorlogban 'straight' and gorlorlogba-wari
'straight' are equally descriptors. There is seemingly a difference in syntactic flexibility
of regular nominal constructions as compared to these: those with -ban ~ -wari are not216 Chapter 9commonly attested with case suffocation (although inquiry reveals that informants
consider case-suffixed forms of them acceptable).
The subtly more nominal character of gun.garr-wari as compared togun.garr-nia may
be appreciated from the fact that the latter may be used to question the manner of action,
""how?"". It may, however, also be used to ask about the nature of something, e.g.,
gun.garr-im tmdin 'what's the word?' 'what's the news?' etc. Gun.garr-wari, on the
other hand, is used only as adnominal interrogative:

"Chapter 8
Categories of the finite verb, and the verb in the clause8.1. Introduction: Verbal construction types
There are two common types of verbal construction in Wardaman. One has as its main
constituent a finite verb which by itself expresses the lexical verbal content of the clause.
It carries pronominal adjuncts in keeping with the transitivity structure of the clause
which the verb partly instantiates, and marking for a number of verbal categories
including tense-mood-aspect, and possibly others such as subordination. Finite verbs
may be divided into a number of different formal types, based on shape and analyzability
(see following).
The second kind of construction is one which consists of a verb particle and inflecting
verb. The verb particle, an interesting, multi-functional part of speech, is the basis of
formation of a number of types of adclausal complements (see 11.4.). But for the moment
we will consider it only as part of the verbal construction. In such particle+ finite verb
structures, often most of the lexical verbal content of the clause is associated with the
particle, while the lexical contribution of the finite verb may vary. We might think of the
possible internal relation of particle and finite verb as a spectrum, with variation along
it in terms of the semantic specificity versus generality of the verb. Where the verb is
highly general, it may seemingly contribute only to specification of the transitivity of the
clause, but very little to lexical meaning. Where the verb is semantically more specific
and transparent in combination with the particle, it contributes both to the specification
of transitivity in the clause, and to lexical meaning in a more readily analyzable way.
Most particles tend to be fairly specialized in their co-occurrence, that is, they occur
with only one or a small number of inflecting verbs. But combinations tend to differ in
the extent to which the meaning contributions of particle and verb can be assessed. An
example is birdij, which in material recorded has been found with only two inflecting
verbs. Its combination with the CV- root gi-, yields the meaning 'find, locate'. In
construction with the CV- root na-, it means 'to espy, to find' (as, in the terms of
Australian Aboriginal child-spirit concepts, a father or other relative is said to ""find"" a
child, see Merlan 1986). Such examples present themselves more or less as idioms with
respect to given meanings, in that the contribution to meaning cannot be neatly
apportioned as between particle and finite verb. But such combinations have some
degree of semantic transparency that can be assessed by looking at the meaning the finite
verb may have as sole constituent of a verb phrase, and by comparing the various pairings
of the particle with other finite verbs.
Most of the finite verbs that occur in such combinations as birdij gi- can occur by
themselves as the main constituent in verbal constructions of the first type discussed
above; and from their occurrence there, an independent lexical meaning can be
established. By itself, the verb gi- means 'to put'; and na- 'to see'. We can therefore172 Chaptersappreciate that with respect to the combination birdij gi-, the second combination birdij
na- may be analyzed as 'finding by seeing', or the like. But there seems to be no revealing
way to further analyze the relationship between birdij and gi- in semantic terms.
In other cases of limited co-occurrence of particle with finite verbs, we may speak more
confidently of the semantic contribution and relation to each other of the constituents.
For instance, the particle gayardung 'run' may occur with verbs of motion ya- 'go' and
nyanga- 'come', but we are able to say that the particle expresses a manner of movement,
while the finite verbs differ in directionality.
It is not usual for a particle to commonly occur with more than several different finite
verbs. An important grammatical feature that such alternative combinations may
contribute to, or directly instantiate, is transitivity at the clause level. For example, the
particle birriwirlib 'roll, tumble' with either main motion verb, 'go' or 'come' may only
occur as part of an intransitive clause structure. However, with either wudba- (which by
itself means 'to throw') or bu-, the combination can only occur within a transitive clause
structure (with appropriate pronominal adjuncts, etc.). There are many ways in
Wardaman that such intransitive/transitive pairs or sets with the same verb particle are
implemented, and sometimes here an (at least partial) semantic compatibility between
particle and co-occurring finite verb can be discerned by examining the set of possible
pairings into which each particle may enter (as above, the two pairings with birdij). For
instance, two common combinations into which the particle bard enters are: bard wudba'throw down', and bard we- 'fall down'. From this can be discerned some of the
semantic components associated with bard rather than with the finite verb, i.e., trajectory
downwards. In another example, we find the combinations barlarra gi- 'to hide', and
barlarrajingi- 'to hide, be in hiding', where the lexical semantics of the finite verbs ('to
put' and 'to be, sit' respectively) are expanded into the difference between transitive and
intransitive clause structures. Compare the different possibilities of pairing with bod-ba
'visit': with na- 'see', it means 'to visit'; with nyanga- (otherwise 'to come') the pair
means 'come to visit', and with lawu- (otherwise 'to reach, get to, catch up to, fetch'),
something like 'visit with'.
There are many instances where alternative pairing does not change transitivity value,
but rather subtly alters verbal semantics. The particle birrij-ba with bu- (by itself, 'hit,
strike') means 'to knead'; but with me- (otherwise, 'to get') means 'to stir'. Both finite
verbs determine transitive clause-level structures. Similarly, bag-ba with ya- (by itself
'to go') may be translated simply 'to break'; but with we- (ordinarily, 'to fall') may be
translated 'fall and break, break in falling'. Both of the finite verbs here instantiate
intransitive clause structures.
So far most of the examples have involved pairings in which the particle appears more
specialized than the finite verb in its lexical semantics. We may say this on the basis that
verbs like gi- and bu- occur in combination with many different particles, and in many
instances the semantic contribution of the verb amounts to little more than the
specification of general type of action, or minimally, determination of the transitivity of
the clause. There are, however, pairings with what might be described as semantically
more specific lexical verbs, which co-occurring particles seemingly further qualify. Here
the verbs contribute not only transitivity, but a more specialized lexical meaning. AnCategories of the finite verb 173example in point in the verb bewe- 'to step on, tread upon', which has been found paired
with particles bengmarla in the meaning 'to snap, break', and gilywaj in the meaning 'to
trample'. See 8.19. for more detailed examination of causativization and other transitive/
intransitive pairings.
Insofar as a finite verb appears to only specify transitivity and contribute little to
predicate semantics, it is convenient to consider it an ""Auxiliary"" verb. In interlinear
glosses, many finite verbs in particular constructions are so labelled. However, as we
have seen, there is a variable degree to which finite verbs in particle* verb constructions
may be defined as having only an auxiliary function. Partly by examining alternative
pairings with the same particle, additional degrees of predicate function and semantic
contribution can be discerned.
It can also be seen that particles function to specify verbal semantics. The more fully
they do so, the more limited they are in their possible pairings with finite verbs. The
more generalized they are semantically, the greater are their possibilities of co-occurrence
with a variety of lexical verbs. There is a point at which we want to call the more general
modifiers ""adverbs"", and as has already been indicated at several places in this
description, there is no absolute line that can be drawn in Wardaman between verb
particles and adverbs — both, for example, can form adclausal complements, but the
latter are more limited in this respect. It is, however, useful to recognize a general
difference between the two word-classes in the terms given.
Finite verbs fall into several different formal classes. There is a small but very
important set of 15 or 16 CV roots (see 8.16.), all of these are of high frequency both as
independent verbs, and most also as auxiliaries or supporting predicates in particle+ verb
constructions. These are ba- 'burn, thirst', bu- 'hit', ga- 'take', gi- 'put', la- 'bite', lu'cry', me- 'get', na 'see', ni- 'bring', nge- 'sing', ngu- 'eat, consume', we- 'fall', wo'give', να- 'go', yo- 'spear', and yu-, copula (see 8.20.). The verb ""go"" is so irregular
that it is not particularly useful to classify it as a CV- root, hence the alternative 15 or 16.
There are finite verbs of two syllables which are morphologically unanalyzable, or
monomorphemic. Examples are bewe- 'tread on', buju- 'to dig', gaju- 'to rise, grow',
gerle- 'to taste', gerne- 'to take away from'; gewu- 'to shoo, chase away', gila- 'to water,

at', menyje- 'to feel', mowo- 'to steal', ngenyje- 'to choke', nyanga- 'to come', waja'to leave', yana- 'to do, say', yeli- 'to call out', and yonga- 'to farewell'. Some of these
show a suggestively similar final syllable, e.g., the final -(ny)je- in linyje- 'cut', menyje 'feel', and ngenyje- 'choke', indicating that this may be historically analyzable.
Some verbs of two syllables, and all of three syllables or more, are morphologically
analyzable into two parts, a variable initial element and a small set of inseparable, final
auxiliary-like elements. These include the pairs -ma and -ba which are in complementary
distribution depending on the stem-final element; -wu and -bu, also in complementary
distribution; a small number of verbs with final element -ma, suggesting that this also
may be historically separable; a small number of verbs with final syllable -rla some of
which contrast with verbs which lack this element, and on the basis of which the final
syllable may be seen as a transitivizing element; and a few verbs which contain a final
syllable ->·/- (post-nasal -ji-), identical with what is elsewhere the reflexive-reciprocal174 Chaptersmarker, but which here must be defined as a formal marker of a small class of
mediopassive verbs.
Where the syllable -ma occurs, the initial element may be analyzed as ending in any
segment but a stop; the shape -ba follows stops. Examples are: giirrg-ba- 'sleep',
gayg-ba-' shout', barlirrg-ba-' sweep', bidbid-ba-' twirl firedrill', borlorrod-ba-' spread
o\A\jongorog-ba- 'yawn' Jornog-ba- 'fill up', lorrod-ba- 'sharpen', mowoj-ba- 'sneak
away', wud-ba- 'throw'; yerrb-(b)a- 'be ashamed', yid-ba- 'sharpen', andyurrg-ba'feel'. Examples with final -ma- axe:jong-ma-' kiss' Jorl-nia-' kick', nmrndi-nia-' mind,
look after', newerr-tna- 'be hungry', nginy-nta- 'help', ngorr-nia- 'grind', ngunyangma- 'knead', warrang-nia- 'swear', warrgany-ma- 'mess up', born-nia- 'bathe, wash',
and others. This final syllable, -ba or -nia, is probably to be seen as historically relatable
to the final particle suffix of the same allomorphy (11.1.2.). Such a relationship is
supported by the fact that there are some forms with this final syllable which are inflecting
verbs, or alternatively may function as verb particles, e.g., finite ngorlog-ba-, and particle
ngorlogba; or inflecting born-nia-, and particle bornborn 'bathe'.
The shape-ΗΊί occurs after non-nasal sonorants, while -bu occurs after stops and nasals.
Examples of each are: bel-wii- 'slice', jewu- 'show', lawn- 'get, fetch, reach'; versus
lid-bu- 'sew', /wr/z-im- 'make^yerrenggej-bii- 'rummage, make a mess of, jarram-bu'look iar'Jinjin-bu- 'give work to, lay tasks upon', dem-bu- 'peck at'. Historically, this
final element is probably to be related to the finite independent verb bu-, but cannot be
synchronically identified with it, as their past tense suffixes differ (e.g., bel-wu-rri 'he
sliced it' versus bu-ndi' he hit it').
The few verbs which end suggestively, for the purposes of historical analysis, in -rna
are: jomarna- 'to finish off, ledbarna- 'see', and wojbarna- 'listen'. This may be
relatable to na- 'see'.
The verbs which end in -rla, some of which also contrast with stems which lack the
final syllable, are the following:
gayg-babiyima-rladagba-rlawema-rla-'call out'(intransitive) vs.
'inflate' (transitive)
'have' (transitive)
'vomit' (something) vs.gayg-ba-rla-'call out to'wentiyi-'vomit'The small class of verbs called semantically ""Mediopassive"", and which are
constructionally intransitive, includes a number which do not contrast with a paired
transitive verb, but a small number that do, however, as follows.
jawe-yilo-yijerri-yila-yigarrany-jiyiworlgbi-yiburla-yiwali-yi-'be tired'

"Categories of the finite verb 203However, a bipartite transitive-intransitive division of both clauses and verbs is
unsatisfactory. Let us consider clause types first, and here it becomes apparent that it is
useful to recognize at least three major ones, and at least one minor one.
An intransitive clause may be defined as one with one pronominal verb prefix (Table
16, Type 1). Various kinds of complements may occur in the intransitive clause, none of
which is marked in the verb, e.g., a clause with predicate of motion may have a
Dissociative nominal complement, 0-yanggi gunya ' he went away from him', a location
complement of some kind, and so on.
The canonical transitive clause is one in which there are two pronominal adjuncts, one
of which may be linked to an independent Ergative-marked nominal (that is, if this is
present), while the other represents the direct object category (Type 3). There is a
ditransitive clause type, which only a few predicates may realize, in which the two
pronominal adjuncts represent the semantic agent and the semantic indirect object (Type
4).

Type 2 in Wardaman, i.e., that in which there is one pronominal adjunct to the verb, a
semantic agent, and a Dative (often, semantically benefactive) clausal argument function
which cannot be encoded on the verb, but may be expressed by independent nominal
phrase, commonly a pronominal. If one takes the presence of verbal pronominal prefixes
as definitional, this clause type is to be regarded as intransitive. But if one defines the
clause type in terms of predicate semantics and argument roles, such a clause-type would
better be regarded as two-place, rather than one-place (intransitive) with possible
additional complements. The agent nominal, if present in such clauses, is overwhelmingly Absolutive, although it may occasionally be Ergative-marked
One might also recognize as a distinct sub-type the clause with one pronominal adjunct
which is a semantic agent or experiencer, in which there may be an Instrumental phrase
expressing the semantic cause or source. The archetypal predicate which occurs in this
clause type in Wardaman is ba- 'bum, perish', often with Instrumental niarninggam-yi
'sun'. As with other intransitives, there is an optional purposive (formally Dative)
argument position ""for which"" that may occur with this predicate, e.g., nga-ba-n wiya-wu
'I'm thirsty for water'. But the really distinctive things about this clause type are, first,
the presence of the semantically agentive nominal phrase which cannot be marked on
the verb, but instead is realized as Instrument; and the encoding of the sole semantically
patientive nominal by subject form-class in the verb.
It seems out of keeping with the structural diversity of clause types, then, to simply
recognize a distinction between transitive and intransitive clauses. We may more204 Chapter 8usefully recognize (at least) the types shown in Table 16. Some further minor types may
also be identified on both semantic and formal grounds; e.g., that described in the
preceding paragraph; the mediopassive construction; and as will be seen below, a
construction type might be recognized for which a label ""medioactive"" might be coined,
to handle the case of a some predicate (particle plus verb) phrases which mainly designate
weather conditions.
If it is not useful to recognize a simple bipartite division of clauses, it is also not
completely satisfactory to recognize a bipartite division of verbs, for at least two reasons.
The first is that the transitivity value of finite verbs as sole predicate constituent, and as
member of a particle plus verb construction, may be and often is different. There is a
large number of particle plus verb combinations, in which the finite verbs are the same
ones that generally occur elsewhere as predicates of transitive clauses. With some
particles, however, they do not determine transitive clause structure. For example, the
finite verb gi-, by itself, is transitive, or the predicate basis of transitive clauses. With
the particle mllid 'show', however, it takes only one pronominal adjunct, and any indirect
object, ""person shown to"", is a Dative-marked nominal which cannot be encoded in the
verb; thus its argument structure is of the Absolutive-Dative kind. In combination with
other particles, such as denberr 'hang up, suspend', gi- is the basis of transitive clause
structure.
In the same way the verb root bu- may occur in transitive and other clause types
depending upon its occurrence as sole predicate, versus its particular lexical combination
with given particles. Although bu- as sole verbal constituent is transitive, in the particle
plus verb combinationyMrd^a) bu- 'to show to' it occurs in the Absolutive-Dative clause
type, and any ""person shown to"" must be Dative-marked outside the verb.
The root bu- is particularly common in particle plus verb combinations which designate
weather conditions, and clauses of this kind show no evidence of being structurally
transitive. For example, in clauses with the particle plus verb combinations jurrg(ba)
bu- 'sprinkle, rain lightly', and larrawardba bu- 'to break' (of day), there is no syntactic
indication of transitivity:
(482)galulul ya-0-wudba
toprdp 3-3SG-throwmarlnga
cloud-ABSjurrg-ba
sprinkleya-0-bu-n-ga
3-3SG-AUX-PRES-SUB'Way high up clouds form when it sprinkles'.
There has never been found to be an explicitly agentive nominal which may occur with
this combination, although the ""cognate"" nominal wiyan 'rain', in Absolutive form, may
co-occur.
(483)larraward-ba
break-PSya-0-bu-n
3-3SG-AUX-PRESmaminggani
sun-ABS'The day is breaking'.
The Absolutive form of ""sun"" in propositions with this combination may be taken as
an indication that it is formally intransitive (i.e., one-place). It might, as suggested above,
be useful to recognize this as a distinct predicate class, for bu- otherwise typically occursCategories of the finite verb 205in transitive or Absolutive-Dative clause types. Combinations of bu- with other particles,
such as bag 'break', yield transitive clause structures.
Likewise, the verb na- 'see' is ordinarily transitive (ngawun-da-n Ί see them'), but
occurs in a formally intransitive clause structure with the particle lag(ba), meaning as a
whole 'to dry up, become dessicated'; in this combination, it is partly synonymous with
the combination lag(ba) ngegba- 'to die and dry up', where ngegba- normally, as sole
predicative constituent, occurs in intransitive clause structure.
The second kind of evidence that militates against a strict transitive-intransitive
distinction at the level of the predicate is the fact that one important predicate, yana- 'say,
do' is found used both transitively and intransitively. Clauses with this predicate tend to
be structured transitively first, where there is a jussive complement of ""commanding
that"" (see 477 above), or second, of ""saying to that"" with complement clause not one of
directly reported speech, in which case the person told may be treated as direct object:
(484)ngan-yana-rri
3SG/lSG-say-PSTya-0-nyangi-we
3-3SG-come-FUTyiwarna
nextwiyan
rain'She told me she will come next year'.
Note that this amounts to the possibility of ""indirect"" report, i.e., the report is not framed
as direct speech, but rather as a summary of what was said, or as indirect speech.
Transitive usage of the verb also is common where what is said is a nominal ""cognate
object"" of speech of some kind, and not necessarily a complement clause:
(485) nganburr-yana-rri-ya
3NSG/lSG-say-PST-NARmadin
word-ABS'They gave me knowledge', in the sense 'they imparted information'.
Intransitive usage tends to correspond to the function ""tell to"", ""say to"" or ""relate to"",
where the complement is a clause of reported (direct) speech:
(486) dana-ni-wan
this-ART-DF0-yana-rri
3SG-say-PSTnganu
1SG-DAT""This is the one"", she said to me'.
The same possibility of variable transitivity exists with the particle plus verb
combination yang(ma) bu- 'tell, inform'. Ί informed them' may be either yang
nga-bu-ndi wurrugu or yang ngawun-bu-ndi, and either may have a full linked clause
(either independent or subordinate in form) specifying the content of the report. Textual
examples were recorded in which the particle jurd-(ba) 'show, indicate', which normally
occurs with finite verb bu- in Absolutive-Dative clause-type such that any ""person shown
to"" must be put into Dative case, alternatively occurs with constructionally transitive
yana-, as indicated by the fact that the one to whom something is shown is marked by
object pronominal form in the verb. (For a parallel difference in transitivity of the ""say""
verb in Wakiman, see Cook 1987: 221.)206 Chapter 8Given the evidence presented here of the inadequacy of a bipartite transitiveintransitive distinction at either clause- or predicate-level, we nevertheless capture
something significant about the language by noting that there tends to be congruence
between particular verbs as sole predicative constituent and particular clause types, i.e.,
bu- as sole predicate normally occurs in transitive clauses. Further, predicates which as
sole constituent function transitively also, in combination with particles, commonly
occur in Absolutive-Dative clause structures; but predicates which function intransitively
as sole verbal constituent also tend to function intransitively in combination with
particles.
There is no single process of transitive-intransitive derivation (but see 8.19. on
causatives). Rather the difference between transitive and intransitive predicate meanings
and associated clause structures is generally managed ""lexico-syntactically"", by the
alternation of different finite (auxiliary) verbs with the same particle. Hence, the
difference implemented by such alternation is often not simply a grammatical one relating
to transitivity, but may also involve additional elements of lexical semantics. Below are
listed a number of common alternations of the same particle with different finite verbs,
the difference instantiating the difference between transitive and intransitive clause
structures:

The sense of some of the pairs listed may be more or less transparent. In some cases
the pair corresponds to a difference in transitivity in clause type, but seemingly without
great semantic difference, e.g., mamaj ngen-me-n 'he beckons me', versus mamaj
ya-0-yana nganu 'he beckons to me', or the like.
The difference in pairings with wabirl is that between ""peel"" or ""take the skin off,
versus ""come, peel off, fade, fall off, as one might say of paint on the wall or colour in
clothing.
There are many alternative possible pairings where there is no change in transitivity of
the clause, but rather a semantic difference in the nature of the action predicated. In
Wardaman, this kind of alternation cannot be seen as of formally different kind to the
transitive-intransitive pairings shown above. Some of these alternative pairings give
some insight into verbal lexical semantics. Examples are:

12.2.5. Negative particles wonggo and warna
There are two negative particles wonggo and warna, which do not appear to differ in
possibilities of syntactic distribution, but do differ in relative frequency. Of the two,
wonggo is the most common in the speech of all from whom lengthy texts have been
collected, with the exception of one person whose texts tend either to have approximately
equal numbers of these particles, or a slight preponderance of warna. However, since
this person was a minor contributor to the text collection overall, it is difficult to know
what to make of his case. People from whom the greatest amounts of material were
collected, including notably Elsie Raymond, her father, and Lily Gin.gina, used both
particles, but showed a disproportion ranging as high as ten to one in any given text in
favour of wonggo, but in some texts (those with the lowest number of negated clauses)
occurring in equal proportions.
Both are clausal negators, and generally occur immediately preceding a finite verb, or
before particle plus finite verb combination, or sometimes in between particle and finite
verb (see below). Both may negate verbless predications, i.e. those in which the
predicative constituent is a nominal (including pronoun), and the 'missing verb' to be
understood as a copular one of being. Negations of existence of something in a place
are generally made with -wagbawun suffixed to a nominal (5.3.2.). Although warna is
overall less frequent and both negators may occur in all possible syntactic contexts, there
nevertheless appears to be a slight preference for warna to be more frequent in verbless
(zero copula) construction type rather than as negator of overt, finite predications,
compared to the frequencies of wonggo in these two different contexts. This suggests
there may formerly have been a clearer distributional difference between them, but if so,
it has been eroded.
Both particles may occur with the range of tense-aspect-mood forms, i.e., with present,
past, ordinary future, and potential. Because of the particular meaning of the
'admonitive' category, designating an as-yet unrealized situation as unwelcome (e.g.,
""lest he get sick""), the negative particles are not found, or at least have not been found
in material collected, in that construction type.
As discussed in 8.9.2., functional negative imperatives are not distinct from negated,
irrealis present forms of the verb, thus irrealis yi-ni-marn-bu-n 'you (SG) may make it'
and negative imperative wonggo yi-ni-marn-bu-n 'you ought not/cannot make it', also
functionally an imperative ""do not make it!"". A basic distinction exists between negative
predications which negate a predicate of indicative mood, versus those which negate a
predicate of irrealis mood. For the present tense, the difference may be illustrated by the
contrast between wonggo (or warna) nganja Ί am not going', the negative of the
indicative form nganja Ί am going' (this instant, or imminently), versus wonggoAvama
yi-nganja Ί may not/cannot/ought not go'. All of the glossed non-indicative modalities
are expressed formally with the irrealis markers (i.e., first position prefix/es and
appropriate pronominal adjuncts (see 6.7.3.).","[323, 324]"
"8.2. Overview of tense-aspect-mood categories
A main contrast within the system of verbal categories is that between Indicative and
Irrealis tense-mood-aspect forms. Indicative forms are those in which there is no explicit
qualification of the reality or eventuality of that which is designated by the predicate;
Irrealis forms are those which are overtly so qualified. The distinction must be seen as
one which is tailored to the linguistic categories, however, for not all Indicative forms
designate ""real"" events. They are used rather to make predicate meanings in a way that
involves no explicit qualification of the factuality or eventuality of what the predicate
designates.
The Indicative categories are Present, Past, Future and Potential, each of which is
described and illustrated in a separate section below. Each category is marked by one or
more allomorphs, and the tense-mood-aspect categories in the language overall are highly
regular and show little variation. The Present, Future and Potential forms have non-past
ya- in first position within the inflecting verb in 'third person' forms, i.e., in those where
the sole pronominal adjunct is third person, and in those in which both subject and object
are third persons (see 6.6.). This initial non-past, third person prefix in the non-past
categories contrasts with zero in the same position in the Past forms of the verb, e.g.,
yanggun-bu-n 'he is hitting them', versus wunggun-bu-ndi 'he hit them'.
As a whole, the Indicative mood contrasts with Irrealis mood. Irrealis is directly
signalled by first-position prefix(es) in the verb, in general yayi- for 'third person' forms
(as above), and yi- for non-third person forms. There are also some differences from
Indicative forms in person-marking pronominals (6.6.3. for further details). Irrealis
prefixation may co-occur both with Present and Past tense marking, and further, with a
zero-stem form, i.e., one with no explicit tense-aspect suffixation. Irrealis prefixation
with Present forms of the verb expresses modal meanings of the sort ""ought to"", and with
negative particles (either wonggo or warna, 12.2.5.), meanings 'should not', and 'cannot'
(either inability or physical and/or social constraint). Negative Imperatives in Wardaman
(8.9.2.) are not formally distinguished from such forms. Irrealis prefixation with Past
tense marking expresses past counterfactual meanings ""meant to"", ""ought to have"", and
the like. Irrealis prefixation with zero-stem expresses mere possibility ""may, might"" (and
contrasts with Potential, which expresses eventuality but without qualification of the
reality of the event designated by the predicate). A particular use of the Irrealis zero-stem
forms is in what may be called ""admonitive"" constructions, often best translated by use
of English ""lest"". There will be some illustration in this chapter of all of these forms and
uses, and forward reference to discussion of conditional and other constructions in
following chapters.",[199]
"34 Chapter 3The above situations involving rrbefore stem-initial //rl/andd /rd/ yield impermissible
cluster types (rrrl, rrrd), and in fact these are not realized as such. The loss of retroflexion
that occurs here is apparently environmentally different from anything accounted for by
P-l. We may describe this loss of retroflexion:
P-2 De-retroflexion at prefix-stem boundary
[+ retro]
> [-retro] /rr
In short, the presence of rr before any possible initial apical segment results in the
reduction of differences among three underlying clusters (rrrn, rrrl, rrrd) to two
occurring segments, d and /.
Where nasal-final prefixes occur before η-initial verb stems, there is hardening of the
stem-initial nasal to the homorganic stop, and the preceding nasal remains. Examples

accounts both for situations with rr and n before verb stem-initial n, and the isolated
instance of nyanga- 'come'; and then, that the other processes we have seen, of
degemination on the one hand and rr-deletion on the other, apply to the output of this
rule, which may be stated informally:
P-3 Fortition of verb-stem initial nasal segments
/n/
> d/{rr,N}
/ny/
» j / rr
Although the rule is apparently stated as a general, phonological one, its environmental
specificity has been indicated, particularly the limited application of the second part.
We may now state the environment for stopping of rr as follows:
P-4 rr-Stopping
/rr/
> oV+ [+ Stop, -labial, -velar]Conditions: where + is the boundary between pronominal prefixes and verb stem. Some
applications of P-4 arise from P-3.
Now we may account for those environments in which d arising from /rr/ is deleted as
follows. Where there are instances of verb stem-initial d which have been created by
P-3, as well as those where /d/ is basic (as in dagbarla- 'have' (see examples above),
combinations of d + dare simplified to d. We may additionally indicate that in terms of
degemination, this is a boundary of the / (obligatory application) sort.
Additionally, we must account for the deletion of rr before /- initial verb stems. First,
however, it is relevant to note a related paradigmatic irregularity: before /l/-initial stems,Process phonology 35the accusative marker -n does not appear, it is zeroed. The lateral is realized as alveolar
rather than retroflex, so that minimal differentiation among certain forms is not
maintained. Compare the morpho-phonological string to the actually occurring transitive

Condition: rr is the nonsingular formative, + the boundary before verb stem.
3.5.2. Fortition of/w/
Fortition applies to two important instances of basic /w/ which are stopped to b after
nasals, as well as to one morphologically minor one. Elsewhere these instances are
realized as w. The suffixes concerned are future tense /wa/, third person nonsingular
pronominal prefix /wu/, and a nominal derivational suffix /widi/.
Because of stem structure and the details of tense formation, future tense suffix /wa/
may only occur in two morpho-phonological environments: following a vowel, or
following the reflexive-reciprocal marker. Ordinarily, the shape of this marker is /yi/:
ya-wu-rr-bu-yi-n 'they are hitting each other, fighting with each other'. However, before
the future tense suffix, all forms which have the reflexive or reciprocal marker are
characterized by the presence of -ng- after it, i.e., the sequence -yl-ng-. Following this
nasal, and because of assimilation of the suffix vowel to the previous /i/, the shape of the
future tense marker is -be. Thus: ya-\vu-rr-bu-yi-ng-be 'they are going to hit each other,
fight'. This illustrates fortition in the post-nasal environment.
An alternative way of describing the facts would be to simply list two allomorphs of
the future suffix as post-vocalic -wa and as -ngbe in the environment of the reflexivereciprocal marker, that is, treating the latter as a morphological irregularity rather than
as a phonological process. There seems to be little to recommend one description over
the other, except that the second affix, to be described, may be seen as similarly
undergoing fortition following a nasal.
The second hardening of/w/to b involves the prefixal element nonsingular third person
/wu/. Because of its possible positioning within the prefix complex, /wu/ either occurs
in a post-vocalic environment, occurs initially, or follows the accusative-marking36 Chapter 3element -n-. In the former two environments it is realized as wit; in the latter, the initial
semivowel is hardened in the realization bu. An example of this process is in the morphophonological form 3NSG
» 1SG Inga-n-wu-rrl (1SG, accusative, 3NSG, plural),
which is realized as nganburr-. The third instance is that of a rather rare suffix /widi/
(9.8.), which is found, for example, to create a nominal yarrbaly-widi from a particle
yarrbaly 'make a nuisance'. Following a nasal-final particle such asjangang 'persist in
saying to, asking', we fmdjangang-bidi 'persistent'.
The question may be raised whether it is reasonable to take the semivowel-initial forms
of the morphemes under discussion as basic. Could the processes be alternatively viewed
as lenition? This seems counterintuitive first, in the case of nonsingular /wu/ because it
is realized in that shape word-initially, where there is no argument for treating this as a
leniting environment; and in the case of future /wa/, because that is the ""elsewhere""
realization apart from the environment following unpredictable -ng- after the reflexivereciprocal marker. Below (3.7.) are discussed two other processes which have
realizations as \v, but which must be described as differently conditioned from the
instances we have just seen. For this reason the basic segment in the suffixes described
here is treated as /w/, which undergoes stopping to b after nasals.
P-6 /w/-Fortition
/w/
> b / [+ Nasal]
Conditions: morphemes to which this applies are future suffix /wa/, 3NSG /wu/, and
/widi/. Conditioning nasals in the first two instances are -ng- following the reflexivereciprocal, and -n- accusative marker.
3.5.3. Fortition of /m/
An alternation of basic /m/ with b is found in four different suffixes. One is the particle
suffix (11.1.2.) which has the shape ma following all sonorants, ba following stops.
Examples after sonorants are: burrngburrng-ma 'boil', ngurluguy-ma 'mutter, hum';
geleng-ma 'dislike'; many-ma 'aim at'.
The second morpheme is the iterative, inchoative (and in fact functionally somewhat
diversified) suffix /marla/ (see 8.13.). Here good evidence that the nasal-initial form is
properly taken as basic comes from the existence of an independent adverb marla-yl
'again, repeatedly' (where -yi is an adverbial suffix, 5.2.1.).
The third morpheme is the plural noun suffix -mulu, where generally, the m-initial form
occurs after all sonorants, -bulu after stops (e.g., wurre-mulu 'children', yirrug-bulu
1EXNSG pronoun). (Some cases are attested of-mulu after stops, see 5.6.3.)
The fourth is the noun-forming suffix with allomorphs -man and -ban (see 9.3.).
It is important to note that in all these suffixes, post-nasal realization is with m. In
alternations where stops are regarded as basic and semivowel realizations as the result
of lenition (3.7.), the stop-initial allomorph occurs following nasals. This difference
indicates that we do indeed require two different sorts of processes, fortition and lenition,
to describe alternations in the language.","[57, 58, 59, 60]"

122.6. Gewernima 'gammon'
The particle gewemima appears to exhibit the usual particle suffix -ma, here as in yilama,
inseparable. Where the role of speaker coincides with grammatical subject, as for yilama,
the particle is understood most clearly to express speaker estimation that the action is
make-believe, an act of pretending, or otherwise dubitable; otherwise, the notion of
make-believe is understood to inhere in the predication, as in the following example:

Halliday and Hasan (1976: 227) give a general definition of the conjunctive function
which is useful to begin our discussion of particular Wardaman conjunctions, as
""specification of the way in which what is to follow is systematically connected to what
has gone before"". They suggest several different semantic kinds of conjunctive relations:
additive, adversative, causal, and temporal. These, too, will be useful for our discussion
of Wardaman, for there are conjunctions which correspond well to the first three
categories. The fourth, however, seems relatively undeveloped in Wardaman, certainly
in comparison to some other Aboriginal languages of the region.
They also propose a distinction between internal and external conjunctive relations, as
those within the thesis or content of what is being said, and the logical relations within
the speech situation, respectively. That is, ""internal"" and ""external"" are defined in
relation to the text (see Halliday and Hasan 1976: 241). This distinction is also useful
for our purposes here, because it suggests a way of characterizing the difference between
the first two conjunctions to be discussed. These are of ""additive"" type, i.e., are different
kinds of the conjunctive ""and"" relation.
12.3.1. Gabarn 'also, farther'
The most general function of gabarri is to signal that another point is being made in
conjunction with a previous one. Its domain of function is thus essentially external, that
is, has to do with the matter of signalling linkage between one point and another of the
text, rather than signalling that a specific element of textual meaning is additional to and
of the same kind as another (for which see 12.3.2.).
Externality and intemality, however, are a bit difficult to distinguish here, in that one
of the commonest contexts in which gabarri is used is to signal linkage of one point to
another in the text, where the typically clause-level structures used to express both points
have a great deal of common wording, and often differ only in such matters as pronominal
adjuncts in one clause and the other. That is, gabarri is often part of a rhetorical strategy
which uses the notion ""further"" or ""also"" not to express a radically different point from
another one, but to express a high degree of similarity between the two points. It is as
if, in English, we were to exhibit a tendency to restrict the usage of ""further"" and ""also""
to such contexts as the following: ""Alex is a nice boy, and further/also Niko is a nice
boy"". On the whole, gabarri is more similar to English ""also"", which may be associated
with a higher degree of similarity of content of such linked points than ""further"", which
by its very etymology suggests some additional and new development of textual content.
Although gabarri is often clause-initial, it need not be. It also may be used in the two
clauses between which linkage is being effected, the first instance thus signalling
anticipatorily that the linkage is being made. Examples of gabarri follow.","[326, 327, 328, 329]"

"In short, whatever the function of the alternation may have been historically, it seems
not to be associable with a difference between grammatical categories now. Any
supposed levelling of a previous grammatical difference may have to do with the wide
distribution of the -ba ~ -ma verb class in the contemporary lexicon, where the suffix is
re-interpreted as a mark of predicate function per se, and not of contrast within the system
of verbal categories.
11.1.3. Negative imperative particle constructions
Positive imperatives are not ordinarily formed using the particle alone (as is apparently
the case in Wakiman, see Cook 1987:255). Thus, one usually orders someone, notduba
'sit down!' with particle alone, but dubajingi 'sit down!', with particle plus finite verb.
While the particle may occur by itself as imperative, this apparently has the quality of a
truncated or elliptical utterance.
Negative imperatives of particle plus finite verb constructions may be formed as usual,
that is, such constructions are identical to the Present Irrealis tense-mood-aspect forms:

Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements11.1. Introduction: Special properties of particles
Many languages in this region, like Wardaman, have predicate structures of more than
one kind, some of which consist of more than one word. Verbal construction types were
described in 8.1., and the distinction was made between predicate structures consisting
only of finite verb, and those consisting of verbal ""particle"" (following some longstanding Australianist usage, see Dixon ed. 1976) and finite verb. We saw that among
the finite verbs which may occur as predicators by themselves, with full lexical meaning,
are high-frequency verbs (including most of the CV- roots) which also occur widely with
verb particles, to constitute most of the language's verbal lexicon. It was shown that
there is moderate flexibility in alternative pairings of the same particle with different
verbs, and that this kind of alternation, besides making differences in lexical meaning,
also instantiates differences in clause-level transitivity in what was accordingly termed
a ""lexico-syntactic"" manner. This kind of transitivity system is consistent with the fact
that there tends to be a strong coincidence between particular verb and either transitive
or intransitive clause type (e.g., bu-, gi- etc. transitive, jingi- intransitive). However, a
simple dichotomy between transitive and intransitive clauses and/or predicates was
argued to be inappropriate, mainly because of the considerable degree to which verbs
which, as clausal predicates by themselves determine transitive clause structure, with
particles may instantiate the Absolutive-Dative clause type.
Although particle plus verb constructions occur in many other languages of the area,
their range of functions is rather distinctive of the group of presumed congeners including
Wardaman (for Wakiman, see Cook 1987 Chapter 9; the same range of functions is
indicated by the more limited material available for Yangman). Particles in these
languages have at least two major functions: first, they productively occur with finite
verbs to express predicate meanings; and second, case-marked in a number of ways that
will be described in this chapter, they form clausal complements. It is in this second
range of functions that the particle system of Wardaman and congeners is particularly
distinctive, as compared with other regional languages. For example in the languages
immediately to the east (of the Wardaman-Yangman dialect continuum), Mangarrayi and
Alawa, particle plus verb constitutes the usual kind of predicate construction. But the
extent to which particles in those languages may be used in adclausal complement
constructions is very limited, and in particular, there is no parallel to the Allative-marked
complements described in 11.4.3. and 11.7. Though the particle plus verb construction
type of all of these languages is superficially similar, the differences in syntactic
distribution of the particles support the view that we are not dealing with similar syntactic
systems. There appear, also, to be some, much more minor differences between
Wardaman and Wakiman in the way that particles function: in Wardaman they do not262 Chapter 11occur alone, without finite verb, as imperative utterances (Cook 1987: 253). This
difference may be related to some others, e.g., the fact that the 'particle suffix' in
Wardaman (11.1.2.) cannot be clearly associated with aspectual categorial meaning in
the way it apparently can in Wakiman (Cook 1987: 235).
11.1.1. Particle shapes
The particle suffix of shape -ba ~ -ma may be freely suffixed to the majority of particles,
and also to many of what are considered in this description to be ""adverbs"", that is, verbal
modifiers of a more general sort which may occur with a large number of predicates. As
noted in Chapter 4, particles constitute an open word class that cannot be strictly
delimited from adverbs, though it is useful to retain a distinction between them. There
are some particles which appear to contain what is historically the particle suffix, but
which now do not occur without it. For example duba 'sit' was probably dub-ba, and
with degemination normally occurred as duba. The suffix-less form dub, however, is not
used, in contradistinction to most particles of this shape which still have suffixed and
suffix-less alternative forms (e.g.Juba 'be deaf, shut, blocked', and alsojub). There is
also a large number of particles (such as the high-frequency ngorlog-ba 'talk') which
characteristically occur with the particle suffix, and although informants consider them
acceptable as particles without the suffix, elicitation and text material fails to reveal any
spontaneously-produced examples in which they lack the suffix. We may conclude that
there is a long-term tendency for the particle suffix to become lexicalized, and that this
may be especially likely where the particle is paralleled by finite verb of the same shape
(ngorlog-ba-, see comments below in on the historical relationship between particles
and finite verbs).
Excluding those forms which are considered adverbs, i.e., general predicate modifiers
which may occur with a wide range of finite verbs, an examination was made of 460
particles to ascertain their shapes. Of these, 449 were finally tallied (the remaining few
were eliminated for various reasons, e.g., lowaglowa 'play' because of the exceptionality
of the gl cluster, jangjajang 'slurp' because of the apparently special nature of the
reduplicative process, etc.). Many fully reduplicative stems were classified as of the kind
of one of their identifiable segments, e.g., dingding(ma) 'be pretty, attractive, look nice'
was classified as if it were ding, i.e., as a CVS particle; wardagwardag 'shake head no',
as if it were wardag, i.e., as a CVC(C)VC particle. The final 449 fell into categories of
the following shapes in the numbers given (illustrative examples are also given):CVS where S = sonorant, e.g., jin 'blame'
CVCV,e.g., /wr/e'cry'
CVStop, e.g., bag 'break'
CVR/LS/N, e.g., bilyb 'switch', waring Open'
CVC(C)VC, e.g., birdij 'find'

.18Obviously the first six categories are the most significant, and all of the categories
comprise permissible consonant-vowel combinations. But it is of interest to know the
average and also maximum lengths and shape-types of the particles to see, among other
things, how they compare with the shapes of finite verbs to which, in a moderate number
of cases, the particles are synchronically related (e.g., particle and verb of the shape
ngorlog-ba).
In a lexical list of nearly two thousand entries, 150 were finite verbs, 15 (or 16 including
ya- 'go') were CV- roots, 20 CVCV- roots, 18 verbs with inseparable suffix -bu, and 63
with final syllable -ba or -ma. Of these, 26 had stem-initial element of the shape
CVC(C)VC before the -ba ~ -ma suffix, 20 initial element of the shape CVS(onorant),
5 of the shape CVCV, 3 of the shape CVCVCV(C), 2 of the shape CVS(top), 5 of the
shape CVSC where S = sonorant, and one of the shape CVCVR/LG. The proportions
of each type are in keeping with the supposition that these are the result of a long-term
process of verbalization of particles.
Recall that the verbal suffixal paradigms in Wardaman are highly regular, and that it
only in the CV- roots, and the two roots nyanga- 'come' and jingi- 'sit', that the -ndi Past
tense allomorph is found. It is also only among these verbs, and those with final syllables
-bu, -rla, -nyje, -rna, and some of the CVCV- roots, that the Present allomorph -n is found.
All other verbs, and in particular the class ending in -ba ~ -ma, have no overt Present
suffix, and all take the Past allomorph -rri. It was also noted in 8.2. that there is a small
number of verbs which have a distinctive Future stem-form, mainly those which have
stem-final a, including some monomorphemic roots such as nyanga- 'come', but also
including the class ending in ba ~ -ma. These facts, and especially that the minority and
perhaps relic Past tense allomorph (-ndi) is found only among those verbs which are
clearly of long-standing in that word class, suggest that the direction of historical change
in the language has been towards verbalization of particles, with an accompanying
process of levelling of verbal suffixal allomorphy. The fact that the verbs which end in
ba ~ -ma have distinctive Future stem vocalism, however, is suggestive of intrusion into
the developing majority verb class of a much older distinction between (let us posit and
label) Future and Non-Future stem forms realized in a particular way (the contrast
between / and a vocalism) for some verbs, and which seems to have played a part in the
realization of Irrealis versus Indicative mood categories.
11.1.2. Particle suffix -ba ~ -ma
The particle suffix may be freely added to members of this word class which otherwise
end in a consonant, e.g., ban.garrg or ban.garrg-ba 'fall, pitch down, headlong',
bulmarrab or bulmarrab-(b)a 'float', lorn 'peel, strip' and lorn-ma, etc. It may also be264 Chapter 11suffixed to some members of the class here called adverbs, e.g., bone and borle-ma
'across', malang and malang-ma 'cross, across', etc.
There is a no doubt etymologically related suffix -ma in Wakiman, which Cook
(1987: 235) describes as implementing aspectual differences in the particle class (or
""participles"", as he terms them). In fact, there he recognizes four aspectual participial
forms: aspectually ""unmarked"" (with suffix -ma for many members of the class);
Punctual, reduced in some way compared to the ""unmarked"" form, and involving zeroing
of-ma for some participles; Sequential with suffix -wi; and Purposive, which is generally
built on the ""unmarked"" stem form by addition of y-gu. Cook (1987: 232) notes that
participles in Wakiman can occur alone without nominal arguments as imperative
utterances, and it would seem (ibid: 255) that such imperative function generally (or
invariably?) involves use of the aspectually ""Punctual"" forms, and not the ""unmarked""
ones.
In contrast, in Wardaman although the alternation between zero-suffixed and -ba ~ -ma
suffixed particles is ubiquitous, no such clear aspectual difference can be discerned in
the alternation, and indeed no perspicuous grammatical distinction can be associated with
it. One piece of evidence of the difference between Wakiman and Wardaman comes from
the fact that the overtly suffixed particles are freely used in imperative constructions, as
the following examples show:

"3.7. Minor assimilations
Minor assimilatory processes affect the semivowels in certain environments. There are
also pervasive, minor assimilations which affect the realizations of vowels.
3.7.1. Semivowels
Articulation of the semivowels tends to be less distinct, up to and including zeroing, in
certain environments where each is followed by its homoganic vowel.
Both verb-stem initial /y/ and /w/ are often reduced or zeroed when each is preceded
by /rr/ of the prefixal nonsingular element, and followed by its homorganic vowel. Such
reduction may also affect /w/ of the third person nonsingular prefixal element /wu/. This
reduction may occur even where there is primary stress on the syllable of which the
semivowel is the margin.
For example, certain future forms of the verb ""go"" exhibit stems yi-ng-be (presumed
stem yi or ying plus future allomorph be; also a reduplicative variant yijing-be).
Examples of the reduction of the semivowel are:
Phonological formRealizationGlossnga-rr-ying-be
yi-rr-ying-be
nga-rr-yijing-benga'rringbe

ngarri'jingbe'we INPL will go'
'we EXNSG will go'

element, as in:
/nga-rr-wu-n-waja/ngarrunwaja'we INPL leave them'Verb stem-initial /w/may likewise show some reduction following rr, e.g. /yi-rr-wudba/
'we EXPL throw it' is generally realized as [yirrudba].
A morphological process of nominalizing verb particles involves the element -yifollowing the particle and particle-final suffix. These elements may be followed by a
complementizer, e.g., one of the case suffixes. (See 11.3. for discussion of the syntax of
such constructions). Examples of these combinations are: /jornog-ba-yi-warr/ 'to be full
up' (with Allative -warr as complementizer; /jabul-ma-yi-warr/ 'smoking'. Such endings
are usually realized as [biwarr] and [miwarr]. That is, the a of the particle-final suffix
and the semivowel are zeroed.
3.7.2. Lateral to nasal assimilation
The directional suffix /Ian/ (7.4.) is frequently preceded by stems which end in velar
nasal. Although request for careful pronunciation always elicits lateral-initial -Ian in this
environment (thus producing the cluster ngl found only at boundary, as indicated in
Table 2), nevertheless in ordinary speech this lateral is often assimilated to the nasal of
the same place of articulation, yielding [gorrong-nan] 'towards the south' rather than
*[gorrong-lan], [galung-nan] 'upwards' instead of careful [galung-lan], etc.
3.7.3. Vowel assimilation
The processes in question are low-level assimilations of certain prefixal and suffixal
vowels to the quality of adjacent vowels in noun and verb stems. Assimilations affecting
prefixes are regressive from the first stem-vowel ""backwards"" to the prefix, those
affecting verb suffixes are progressive from the final stem-vowel ""forwards"" to the
suffixal vowel.
Regressive assimilation from the verb stem applies to certain pronominal prefixes, all
and only those in which the sole vowel is a: 1SG nga-, 1INPL ngarr-, and third singular
nonpast conjugation marker (8.2.) ya-\ transitive combination 1SG
> 2SG ngang-,
and 3SG
> 1SG combination ngan-. Though it usually has the opportunity to apply
to only one vowel leftwards of the conditioning stem vowel, in the case of the habitual
mood prefix ma- followed by a person element in which the sole vowel is a (i.e., the 1SG
element nga-, it applies to both elements in sequence, ma-nga- (see 6.6.4.). It applies
(optionally, but usually) just where the adjacent stem vowel is a mid-vowel, ο or e. The
a of the prefix tends to assimilate to the quality of the mid- vowel. Thus, the relevant
forms of the verb wo 'give' usually (but in careful pronunciation do not necessarily)
become: from /nga-won/ Ί give it', ngowon; from /ngarr-won/ 'we INPL give it',
ngorrwon; from /ya-won/ 'he gives it', yowon; from/ngang-wo-n/ Ί give it to you SG.',
ngongwon; from /ngan-wo-n/ 'he gives it to me', ngonwon. Similarly, in a verb withProcess phonology 41front mid stem-vowel, we find such forms as: from /nga-we-n/ Ί fall' ngewen; from
/nga-rr-we-n/ 'we Incl fall' ngerrwen; from/ya-we-n/ 'he falls', yewen, and so on.
There is a third person irrealis prefix combination yayi- (see 6.6.3.) in which a, being
minimally one vowel removed from the first stem-vowel (i.e., other person-number
elements may follow before the stem), does not assimilate.
An example of a verb with more than one stem vowel is the following: /nga-gomarla-n/
Ί follow him', generally realized as ngo-gomarlan. Where the prefix is bi- or multisyllabic, thus separating the α vowel from the stem, the assimilation does not occur:
/nga-rr-wu-n-gomarla-n/ 'we INPL follow them', ngarrun.gomarlan.
The noun class prefix Imal also commonly shows the effects of regressive assimilation
before a stem with ""next-over"" mid-vowel. Because nouns show much less paradigmatic
variation than verbs — i.e., inflect with a lesser number of elements, and most noun stems
tend to occur with only one class prefix — some nouns quite invariably show this kind
of assimilation. The overall result has evidently been a tendency towards long-term
change, through vowel assimilation and fusion of the erstwhile prefix with the stem,
creating a lexical unit. Examples of this kind are: mogorlgorl Ampelocissus; mordon
'creeper', megerrman 'long yam'. In all these cases, initial mV must now be considered
part of the stem, but historically, is transparently the class prefix /ma/ which has vegetable
foods central among the nouns to which it is usually prefixed. The assimilatory process
is also synchronically active, as in me-dengdeng 'fig' (species), or me-dewoman
yi-mum-gu 'white of the eye, sclera', where /ma/ becomes me- before the mid-vowel.
The stem 'white' may be prefixed with the other noun class markers, in which instances
no assimilation occurs, e.g., wu-dewoman 'white', WU- class. Variation may be observed
in realization of ma- before stems with mid-vowel, e.g., both ma-jem and me-jern
'stomach', occur.
My transcription practice (in the texts and examples) is to write the basic vowel of the
pronominal prefixes, e.g., invariably 1SG nga- no matter what its realization. However,
with the noun class prefix /ma/ the assimilation is indicated in the transcription, since
this does not seem to impede intelligibility or easy identification, given that a single
morpheme is involved. Where (as in megerrman 'long yam') the prefix has become
fused to the stem and there is no alternation of prefix, no morpheme boundary is indicated.
Progressive assimilation affects the realization of the future tense suffix /wa/, the
directional suffix Man/ (sometimes, also, potential -ycm). These processes, however, are
not identical, and will be discussed in turn.
Assimilation of the future suffixal vowel α occurs only to e, after a final stem-vowel e
or /; no change occurs where the final stem-vowel is o. Thus the realization of
/nga-we-wa/ Ί will fall' is ngewewe, where the stem mid-vowel determines assimilation
to it of both 1SG prefix and future suffix; also /nga-jingi-wa/ Ί will sit', ngajingiwe', but
ngongwowa Ί will give it to you', not ngongwowo.
Often, the relevant stem-final vowel conditioning progressive assimilation is / of the
reflexive-reciprocal marker ->·/-. As already noted in 3.4.2. above, and further discussed
in 3.9. below, following this morpheme and before the future tense suffix is a nasal -ng-,
but this does not block the assimilation. Thus, /ya-wu-r-bu-yi-ng-wa/ 'they will fight' is
realized as yawurrbuyingbe.","[63, 64, 65]"
"8.15. Subordinate suffixation
There is a generalized subordinate clause type in Wardaman which fills both
""NP-relative"" and ""T(emporal)-relative"" functions (see Hale 1976 for discussion of this
generalized clause type in a number of Australian languages). Unlike a number of
languages of this region which have only this one generalized subordinate clause type
(see e.g., Merlan 1982 and 1983: 135; Heath 1981), Wardaman also has a range of other
kinds of adclausal constructions (Chapter 11).
In Wardaman, subordination of one clause to another is signalled by means of two
suffixes. One, -n-ga, has non-past temporal reference and expresses imperfectivity of
the predicate to which it is suffixed in relation to the predicate of the linked clause; while
the other, -ny-ga expresses past temporal reference and perfectivity with respect to the
predicate of the linked clause. The suffixes are obviously bimorphemic and may be
analyzed as having a tense-marking element, followed by a common subordinate marker.
Each is suffixed to predicates which are otherwise no different from their normal form.

This element has a clitic-like status: it appears to follow immediately the main

this kind seem to be formulated in such a way that it generally has a nominal constituent
within its scope; but see example (849).
12.3.6. Gija 'just as, as'
There is a conjunction gija which allows statement of the comparability of the content of
two clauses, and is best glossed 'as', 'just as', or 'in the same way that'. Wagayma (see
5.10.) may be used to express comparability at the clause level, as well as at the constituent
level, and so partly overlaps functionally with gija, examples of which follow.

The most pervasive, and in some ways most difficult to define, Wardaman conjunctive
element, is -wan, labelled throughout DF, or ""defocusser"". This is a suffix, rather than
an independent word, and we may begin discussion of the rather subtle cohesive
functioning of this element by considering some regularities of positioning that relate to
its formal dependence.
Most common positional occurrences of -wan are: suffixed to the first word in the tone
group; or suffixed to what may be defined as the first word in a non-initial clause-unit
within a tone group. That is, the occurrence of -wan is most simply described first, in
terms of prosodic rather than grammatical units; but secondly, in terms of its function in
linking clause-level grammatical units within a tone group. These, however, are only
tendencies, and -wan may be found in non-initial position both with respect to tone group
and/or grammatical group; and also, may be suffixed to seemingly the entire range of
different word-level parts of speech. Before we proceed to examine what contribution it
makes, these statements of occurrence require some further explanation.
It may be useful to expand briefly here on what has been said (10.14.) about the
relationship between tone group and clause-level unit.
The general tendency towards coincidence of tone group and clause-level unit may be
illustrated by text extract, divided into prosodic lines:

they put it in the coolamon
they put another under the coals
they put it in a heap, thus
from the food, from those seeds
they gave it out to them one-by-one [severally]'.
In this passage, the tendency for tone group and clause to coincide is realized almost
completely, with the exception of the second-to-last line, which consists only of a nominal
phrase (or series of closely linked and commonly case-marked phrases), making explicit
what is being referred to in the next line, as being given out, and cohering over a much
longer textual stretch with earlier occurrences of the word mayin 'vegetable food'.
Another common tendency is for the tone group to coincide with two clauses, i.e., for
close textual coherence between two clauses to be signalled and confirmed by their
inclusion within a single tone group, such as:
(804)nu-lawu
wirrb nu-me
2NSG-reach wipe
2NSG-AUX
warnarr-warra
yi-lawu-rri-wuya
fat-ADV
lEXNSG-reach-PST-DUwirrb
wipeyitr-me-ndi
1EXNSG-AUX-PST'You go to him and wipe him
we went to him and wiped him with fat'.
Types of constructions involving particles which make the coincidence of tone group
with clause less complete, and create more structurally variable text units, were described
in 10.14.
The single most clearly identifiable contribution that -wan makes is that it signals
linkage to, or general textual cohesion of, a sequence in relation to a preceding one. The
""scope"" of such retrospective cohesive relations cannot be neatly structurally defined,
but is influenced by the nature of the grammatical unit or constituent to which -wan may
be seen as suffixed. For example, it becomes relevant to observe here that while there is
relatively little use of an element of the ""then, next, after that"" type, there is some use in
that function of the Ablative form of the demonstrative nana 'that', i.e., nan-ba 'from
there, then' etc. Very commonly where this occurs, -wan is suffixed to it, and thus while
the conjunction itself expresses forward textual movement, -wan expresses what has been
called a retrospective cohesion, or an explicit indication of a textual link with what has
gone before. The entire sequence would thus best be glossed ""and then, and from there"",
i.e., where -wan has a rather purely structural, linking function, the semantics of which
however is highly coloured by the nature of that to which it is suffixed. An example is:

The reason for which -wan has been labelled ""Defocusser"" throughout remains to be
clarified, and is related to the seemingly very broad kind of cohesion-signalling device
that it is. Insofar as its central function is that of signalling linkage, its occurrence appears
to have the overall textual effect of a kind of de-emphasis ofthat to which is it suffixed
and/or which it appears to be relating to preceding text. In other words, this effect of
de-emphasis is best understood as a consequence of its function, that of signalling that
something is to be related to what has gone before. This downplays the textual novelty
and independence of that which -wan introduces, and treats it as topical in the sense of
presupposable, whether or not it has been previously introduced. ""Given"" and ""new""
cannot be treated as an axis independent of the construction of text, and -wan appears to
constitute information as presupposable.
Following with comment are instances of the occurrence of -wan, variably positioned
and always illustrated with sufficient surrounding text material to try to give some sense
of its textual placement.

"7.2. Demonstrative categories and some related forms
The demonstrative pronouns, may serve either as modifiers within a nominal phrase, or
like all sub-types of nominal in Wardaman, may by themselves constitute the sole,
reference-making member of a nominal phrase. As modifiers, they normally occur
within a phrase preceding the modified, but the reverse order may be found (10.3., 10.9.).
As modifiers and arguments, the demonstrative pronouns may be inflected for the range
of nominal case-suffixes.
The system of demonstratives shows a tripartite division in terms of spatial categories
which will be called ""Immediate"", ""Proximate"" and ""Remote"". These categories are
roughly translatable in English as ""this"", ""that"" and ""yonder"", and the spatial and textual
semantics of all of them will be illustrated below. In summary fashion, the spatial
reference of the Immediate category is in the vicinity of the speech situation, and may
designate within the vicinity of the speaker, hearer or both. Something that is designated
as ""that"" in the sense of distal from speaker but close to hearer is liable to be coded with
the Proximate category, but never with the remote category as it is still within range of
the location of the speech event. The Immediate and Remote categories are the most
closely linked in most of their uses to spatial semantics, although forms of the immediate
category may have textually immediate reference to that just said or about to be said.
The Remote category is most restricted to spatial reference in the extra-linguistic context138 Chapter?(as opposed to linguistic), and its use seems to be to refer to things, objects, locations etc.
which are generally visible from the location of the speech event, or portrayed as visible
from the perspective of a narrated or reported speech event, but in either case distal from
it.
This leaves relatively unspecified the proximate category, which is in fact widest of the
three in its range of uses, and the least restricted in its textual and other extended
distribution. As noted above, it may designate within the general vicinity of the speech
situation something that is distal from speaker and close to hearer, or something that is
distal from both but still relatively close. Further, it is the category generally used to
code the textual familiarity of some nominal, where its use often amounts to specification
of definiteness of the referent via its proximate text-spatial semantics. In this definitemarking usage it is often best translated by English definite article. It is also the category
most widely used to mark the relation of units of text to others, by means of inflected
forms which mean such things as ""and then, after that"", and so on.
Case forms in the three series are shown in Table 12. Stem morphology is not
complicated: each series has an Absolutive form, and a stem-form used with non-zero
suffixes. The two stems differ most unpredictably for the remote category.

"10.14. Particle function and position in clause and tone group
There is a tendency for particles to occur immediately preceding the finite verb with
which they are in construction, but as in Wakiman (Cook 1987: 241), this is not their
invariable position. The usual positioning, amply illustrated throughout this grammar,
is of the following sort:
(609) narru
wurr-waja-rri-ya
dodge
3NSG-AUX-PSTONAR
0-me-ndi-ya
ngawun
3SG-AUX-PST-NAR nowonggo
negbalyag
touch'They dodged and it did not touch them'.
However, within a tone group comprised of a single clause and as well, within complex
or multi-clause tone groups, the alternative positioning is commonly found:
(610) gam-gu
spear-DATwurr-waja-rri-ya
3NSG-AUX-PST-NARnarru
dodge'They dodged the spears'.
The following examples (drawn from texts) illustrate the alternative positioning:

Possibly, given its usual position before the finite verb, the post-verbal position, and
particularly the tone-group final position gives a special prominence to the predicate
meaning expressed by the particle.
In general, insofar as a determinate semantic relation can be posited between particles
and finite verbs, the former may be said to restrict the latter in that they contribute a
specificity of meaning that the latter does not have by itself. Particles do not regularly
combine with each other to constitute predicate meanings in the way, for example, two
or several verbal roots regularly serialize in some New Guinean languages; examples
with more than two particles within the same finite clause have not been found, and those
of two are not regular, idiomatic combinations. Where two particles occur together, there
seems to be a regular semantic relationship between them of the following two kinds.
First, one of the particles might be described as semantically more specific than the other.
It is one that enters into regular combination with the finite verb in a unique lexical
predicate meaning. The other particle is more general than the first, semantically
compatible with it, and refines or elaborates it semantically. This second particle tends
to be of such generality that, along a notional spectrum of predicate modification such
as was mentioned in Chapter 4, it might fall into the category of adverb.
In the second sort of case, there again exists a relation of semantic compatibility,
perhaps even partial synonymy, between the two particles, which need not be contiguous
within the clause, and together they reinforce a particular predicate meaning, or express
a conjunction of partly similar, paired meanings. The relation of specificity and
generality typical of the first sort of case is not found here; instead, the two particles
appear to be of approximately equal lexical specificity. Examples of these sorts of
combinations follow.(614) nan-guya

"3.4. Final syllable reduction in nominal stems
There is a pervasive process of final syllable reduction in nominal stems before non-zero
suffix. However, one finds that to some of the same stems that are often reduced, on
other occasions speakers will add case and other endings without reduction. That is, the
process of reduction appears at least partly facultative. Elicitation concerning this matter
reveals an extensive speaker willingness to accept either particular reduced forms as
described below, or unreduced stem forms (with a few exceptions where speakers will
only accept the unreduced form as inflecting stem, e.g., with banggin 'back'). In general,
then, we are not dealing with a matter of strict grammaticality. Despite the apparent
speaker flexibility, one finds from both elicitation and text materials that a certain stem
form, either reduced or unreduced, is the most common for a particular noun, when the
speaker is asked to use the noun in some context, rather than to concentrate on the
acceptability of one or another stem form. There are only a few nouns for which the
reduction process seems to be truly optional in a statistical sense. Therefore, I will
include some comments below about the most common forms for particular nouns.
Cook (1987: 80-83) describes a generally similar process in Wakiman, but the details
differ considerably for each language. Wardaman and Yangman are much more similar
to each other in respect of this process than either is to Wakiman.
In Wardaman, a significant number of nominals (nouns and adjectival nouns) end in
final syllable -CVn. However, it seems for purposes of describing the reduction process
we should distinguish between final -Cin syllables, for some of which (depending partly
on the identity of C) there is often reduction up to and including the entire syllable; and
final -CVn, by which here we understand V to be any vowel besides /. In the latter type,
reduction is simply of the final -n, which may therefore be identified synchronically as
an Absolutive suffix for large numbers of nominals, and historically as that, and/or as
some sort of nominal derivational suffix. (It is also the latter synchronically, see 11.1.4.).
Taking the simplest case first, that of -CVn in the sense identified above, we may
exemplify loss of final -n before non-zero ending with luwun 'cave', bomdoyorron
'pandanus', gangman 'kangaroo' and wurren 'child'. Usual case forms for such nouns
are, e.g., Locative luwu-ya 'in the cave', Allative luwu-warr 'into the cave', and Ablative
luwu-wa 'from the cave'; Locative borndoyorro-ya 'in the pandanus', borndoyorro-warr
'to the pandanus', and borndoyorro-wa 'from the pandanus'; Ergative gangma-yi
'kangaroo', Dative gangma-wu; Ergative wurre-yi 'child', Dative wurre-wu, Dual
Absolutive wurre- wuya, Plural Absolutive wurre-mulu, and so on.
Adjectival nouns like the word Wardaman itself commonly undergo reduction. For
example, from that stem may be created a form meaning explicitly ""Wardaman
language"", with class prefix wu-. Usually (but not invariably) reduced and inflected with
an adverbial suffix, this expression is commonly used to mean ""by means of the
Wardaman language, in Wardaman"": wu-wardama-warra (one also finds simplyProcess phonology 29wardama-warra, and also wardaman-barra is acceptable though appears to be less
common in actual usage when attention is not focused on the reduction process).
For all -CVn nominals with minimally bisyllabic root (i.e., excluding such nouns as
wu-bin 'thumb', to which the process does not apply) reduction is far more common
before non-zero affix than is retention of -n.
There is at least one high-frequency nominal to which -n is commonly added to create
an inflecting (Ergative) stem-form, where the -n does not appear in the Absolutive. This
is lege One', which has alternative (and approximately equally used) Ergative forms
lege-yi and lege-n-yi. Other cases are built on the zero stem.
There is greater variability in patterning among nominals with final syllable -Cin, and
it seems we ought to distinguish at least three sub-types here, though most of them exhibit
some internal variability. These are: nominals with final syllable -Nin, where N is a nasal;
of final syllable -L/R/Y where L is a lateral, R a rhotic, Υ the semivowel; and of type
-Sin, where S is a stop (and here, the most variable sub-set of this sort has final syllable
-gin; variation is linked to the segment which precedes this final syllable).
Nominals with final -Nin are the least variable. The inflecting stem is formed by
reduction of -in. Examples are: Absolutive linin 'snake', ERG lin-yi, DAT lin-gu;
Absolutive yumin 'tree, wood', INST yum-nyi (see 3.5.4. for the assimilatory process
here), LOG yum-nya, DAT yum-gu, Adverbial yum-barra; ABS langganin 'billabong',
LOG langgan-nya, etc. However, there is some variation in longer stems of this
description as to whether they reduce or not; e.g., Absolutive marranyin 'sand, sugar',
has alternative inflected forms Ablative marranyin-ba or marrany-ba, 'having' forms
marranyin-garang or marrany-garang, and so on. In my data the reduced forms are more
common than unreduced for trisyllabic -Nin stems.
However, it is important to mention that some nouns with final nasal segment, where
this was preceded by another consonant (i.e., there would have remained a cluster after
syllable reduction), were found not to conform to the -Nin pattern described above, but
rather reduced only -n, or not at all. An example of this kind is warlngin 'fly', which had
usual and acceptable case-inflected forms of the sort warlngi-yi or warlngin-yi (ERG).
Below it becomes clear that the presence of stem-final clusters is a factor relevant to
reduction where other segments types are involved.
The second sub-type is -L/R/Yin, where the syllable margin is a non-nasal sonorant.
Here the most common pattern seems to be for final syllable to lose -in, but loss of just
-n is attested in some nouns, and (perhaps relevant) particularly commonly with certain
kinds of suffixes. There are also in the class two high-frequency nouns layin 'game, meat',
and mayin 'vegetable food', and besides conforming to the minority pattern in that both
typically lose only -n, the former is idiosyncratic in its possible stem-forms.
The most general pattern for this sub-type, loss of-in, can be illustrated by the common
nouns, Absolutive forms of which arejerrin 'ground oven', warnarrin 'fat', and bulilin
'blood': Locative jerr-ya, Ablative jerr-wa, DAT jerr-wu; DAT warnarr-wu, 'having'
warnarr-warang; 'having' bulil-warang ('menstruating'). However, non-reduced
alternatives are accepted for most such nouns (e.g., LOG jerrin-nya), though they are
not in fact as commonly used.","[52, 53]"
"Chapter 12
Clausal particles, conjunctions, and interjections12.1. Introduction
In this chapter are drawn together several functionally diverse categories of elements,
most of them categorizable as ""particles"" in having independent word status, and not
inflecting. However, some of the forms discussed in this chapter are clitics, and others
(like marrig, 12.2.1.) are clitic-like in usually occupying a determinate position
(following the first full word) of the clause. Beyond that, the forms are divisible into at
least three functional sets, with a degree of overlap between any two, in that some forms
may be assigned to more than one set.
The first set, called ""clausal particles"", function to subcategorize the predicate in terms
of modal semantics, and occur in construction with the entire clause. To an extent, some
of these clausal particles tend to occur with certain tense-aspect-mood inflectional forms
of the verb (as gala 'try' often occurs with future), but most are not as clearly restricted
in this way. One, bujun 'if etc., occurs frequently in the construction of conditional
clauses, but this is not its sole function. Other members of this set, such as yilama 'might
be' freely occur with a range of different verb forms, and generally introduce a meaning
of speaker speculation or hypothesis ""I suppose"" etc.
The second set, ""conjunctions"", generally function to specify ""the way in which what
is to follow is systematically connected to what has gone before"" (Halliday and Hasan
1976: 227). Several different semantic sub-types of conjunctive relations are
distinguished.
The third set, ""interjections"", are forms which constitute a complete utterance by
themselves. However, while they may do so formally, interjections are of course also
cohesive, and express comment partly on elements of the communicative situation, rather
than simply upon its prepositional content. To the extent that they do the former, they
are conjunctive in the general sense given above. We find therefore that one of the major
conjunctions, ngala 'but, however', also occurs as interjection.
There is a small set of forms (two independent words, and one clitic) that combine
text-cohesive and interjectional properties in a way that does not lend itself to neat
labelling or classification; these are discussed as a sub-class of (most explicitly)
""interpersonal elements"", a label not intended to suggest that other formal classes and
elements do not have an interpersonal dimension.","[314, 315]"

As some of the examples show, -nvn often seems to have a liminal component of

it is suffixed Conceivably this suffix is relatable to the verbal suffix -nun in Wakiman,
which Cook (1987: 184) glosses 'progressive aspect'.
7.6.7. Secondary adverbs
A few common adverbs are worthy of mention as ""secondary"", that is derived from
basically adverbial forms by means of nominal case-suffixes. The processes involved
are not regular, but examples include: gurru-ya 'later', built from the adverbgiirru of
the same meaning by addition of the Locative case suffix; niarla-warr Over and over,
again', built from what is elsewhere (8.13.) an iterative verbal suffix by means of the
Allative case-suffix; andyijarlu-warr 'sometimes', built from the adjectival nominal
stemyijarlu 'some', again with the Allative suffix.","[192, 193]"
