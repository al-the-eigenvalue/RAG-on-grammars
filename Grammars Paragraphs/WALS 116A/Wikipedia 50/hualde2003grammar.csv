Nonetheless, despite the last two appearances (as complement to a yes-no
question, and as alternative to interrogative -en in either negative contexts
or yes-no questions), the most common syntactic environment for -enik is as
the head of a declarative complement to a negated governing verb.","[675, 676]"
"482 Syntax4.4.5.1.2. Indirect questions
All indirect questions may be marked by the coftiplementizer -n, attached to
the conjugated verbal form. If true questions (as opposed to semiquestions),
they may be preceded by the interrogative particle ea, which may in turn be
preceded by scrambled material. Some examples will be given in
4.4.5.1.2.2.
4.4.5.1.2.1. Indirect yes/no questions
As an alternative to -n, yes/no questions may also be marked by -n(e)z,
-nen(t)z in eastern dialects. Moreover, in substandard southern usages it is
common to find the conditional particle ba (usually with a suprasegmental
pattern which differentiates it from the emphatic marker ba) as the only
marker of indirect questions (cf. Spanish conditional and interrogative si):
(890) Ez dakit zure laguna etorriko
d-entba-da.
not know your friend come.FUT AUX-COMP/if-AUX
Ί don't know whether your friend will come.'

or Baiona.in cannot know AUX
'Whether he sang mass first in Pamplona or in Baiona, we can't tell.'
[Etch. Id. 1:236]
Abstracting away from the effects produced by scrambling, indirect yes/no
questions tend to be verb final, unless they contain any focalized material,
in which case the verbal element will immediately follow the focus in the
left periphery of the clause. Thus, in the last example above, Irunen has
been contrasted with Baionan, and as a consequence of their left-position
the object appears to the right of the verb. When no constituent has been focalized, there is no apparent leftward movement of the verb (unlike what
happens in many direct yes/no questions). Due to the lack of verb fronting,
ba is less common in indirect than in direct questions, although examples do
exist:Focalization(892) Bidriosek

Verb focalization with egin is also possible, just like in direct yes/no questions:

It is difficult to form tenseless indirect yes/no questions, perhaps because
the only overt marker (-n) can only be attached to tensed forms and nothing
would signal the presence of an indirect question in a tenseless clause.
However, they can be formed by adding question identifiers such as ala ez
to the participial form (or to the root in eastern dialects):
(895)*Ez dakit gelditu.
not know remain
Ί don't know whether to remain.'","[511, 512, 513]"
"504 SyntaxEastern dialects possess an alternative strategy, whereby only the auxiliary is preposed and the negative element appears joined with the participle:
(995) Norkduwho.ERGliburuaAUX bookezirakurri?notread'Who hasn't read the book?'
Such construction is totally impossible in western dialects. It is not clear
whether this pattern represents a different strategy or whether it corresponds
to constituent negation. See Lafitte (1944) and Oyha^abal (1985).
Negative yes/no questions are not marked in any special way other than
the presence of the negative particle ez. The yes/no interrogative particle al
and the northern yes/no complementizer -a may be found in these negative
questions:
(996) Ez

Indirect negative yes/no questions differ from direct ones in that auxiliary
preposing is not obligatory. This correlates with the tendency towards verbfinal orders in positive indirect yes/no questions:

'Did they buy MARY the book?'

Verb focalization is occasionally found in yes/no questions. This is possible
in the event emphasis type of focalization described in 4.4.3.2.1. Thus, the
following questions contain a verb emphasized with egin
(957) Ahaztu egin al zarete nirekin?

'Have you forgotten me?' [Atx. Ob.:54]
(958)ΉίΙeginal da?'galdetunuen.diedoQaskAUXAUX""Has he died?', I asked.' [Atx. Ob.: 125]
As for positive polar emphasis, it uses the same verb-fronting mechanism as
yes/no questions, and is therefore virtually indistinguishable from it.",[526]
"4.4.7. Focalization and interrogation in negative clauses
4.4.7.1. Negative questions
Negative wh-questions are formed in the same way as positive questions:
the wh-word will occur immediately to the left of the tensed verbal form.
However, when the latter is an auxiliary, it will appear displaced to the left
of the clause, away from the position to the right of the participle it occupies
in positive sentences (see 4.5). Indirect negative wh-questions are formed in
the same way, differing only in that their tensed verbal form is marked with
the complementizer -n:

AUX(SUBJ).COMP'Why not beg her to lend her some jewels?' [Atx. 06.:219]
In the first two examples the constituents to the right of the participle could
also have been placed in between the neg+auxiliary unit and the participle.
The third sentence provides an example of a tenseless negative question.
Some dialects occasionally admit negative questions where no split between
the auxiliary and the main verb takes place. Such uninverted negative questions have a rhetorical flavor. The 'unbroken' negative pattern was more
widespread in older stages of the language.",[533]

"4.4.6.1.1. Wh-questions and foci
Combinations of wh-words and foci are acceptable for some speakers; in
such cases, the wh-word must occupy the pre-verbal position; the focalized
constituent does not occupy any designated position and is mainly distinguished by bearing contrastive stress:

"2.3.1.2.1. Main prosodic and pragmatic prominence
Traditional grammarians such as Azkue (1931, 1932) and Al tube (1934) described the word preceding the verb as the most prominent element in a sentence, both prosodically and pragmatically. That is, the word preceding the
verb is perceived by speakers as the most prominent, or 'stronger' than the
rest of the words in the utterance. At the same time, Azkue and Altube identified this word, or the phrase it is contained in, as 'the most important piece
of information' in a sentence. This word or phrase could be the element constituting the answer to the interrogative pronoun in questions such as 'What
happened?' or 'Who gave you the book?', for example. This is illustrated in
the question-answer pairs in examples (4) through (6) below. The most
prominent or focalized constituent appears in boldface:Intonation77(4) Ser
galdu dosu?
what lose AUX
'What have you lost?'
Nire amen
dirud
galdu dot.
my mother.GEN money lose AUX
Ί have lost my mother's money.'
(5) Nor ikusi dosu?
who see AUX
'Who have you seen?'
Arrebien lagunen
ume txikind
ikusi dot.
sister.GEN friend.GEN child small.DET see AUX
Ί have seen the sister's friend's small child.'
(6) Ser
emon dotzu?
what give AUX
'What has (s)he given you?'
Amiimen
liburua emon nau.
grandmother.GEN book
give AUX
'(S)/he has given me my grandmother's book.'
The words or phrases responding to the question words sir 'what' and
nor 'who' are interpreted as the most important part of the sentence informationally, that is, as phrases that provide the necessary information that
fills the gap corresponding to the question word. In pragmatic terms, this
constituent is referred to as new information, rheme, or focus. Azkue and
Altube called this element the 'inquired element', referring to the correspondence between this phrase and a presupposed question, and the position
immediately preceding the verb as the position of the inquired element. The
verb itself may be the most prominent element prosodically and semantically, as we will see below.
But the focus or rheme of an utterance does not have to be triggered by a
question. It might appear in a sentence independently in a discourse, as the
speaker organizes and divides his/her utterances in parts carrying different
informational load: theme and rheme, old and new information, or topic and
focus. Like with answers to questions, the constituent that represents the
rheme, new information or focus of a sentence without being the answer to a
question appears immediately preceding the verb, at least in Northern Bizkaian varieties such as Lekeitio Basque (cf. also 4.4). In other varieties, focalized or new information constituents can appear postverbally within a78Phonologyspeaker's narrative discourse, but they must appear preverbally when they
constitute the answer to a wh-word in a preceding question (cf. section
4.4.8).
It is important to point out that the preverbal constituent is not always interpreted as the most prominent element informationally. A whole sentence
may constitute new information as well, if it is uttered out of the blue or as
an answer to a question such as 'What happened?', and reflects the canonical word order in Basque (S-IO-DO-V). In this case, it is still the word preceding the verb that receives the main prosodic prominence, without any
difference in pitch level or pitch excursion with respect to a sentence in
which the word or phrase preceding the verb constitutes new information.
Thus, if the sentence in (7) were the answer to a question such as 'What
happened?', or were uttered out of the blue, the pitch contour of the utterance would be the same as if the preverbal phrase (i.e., the direct object
madari bat 'a pear') were the focalized constituent. The FO contour is illustrated in Fig. 3.

"4.4.3. Yes/no questions and verb focalization
4.4.3.1. Direct yes/no questions
Yes/no questions need not be signalled by any mark other than interrogative
intonation:
(818) Jonek
liburu hori irakurri du?
Jon. ERG book that read
AUX
'Has Jon read that book?'
Some dialects possess overt morphological markers for yes/no questions,
such as G al or eastern (LN, Z, R and Sal), -a; the former is a verbal particle
(3.5.7), while the latter occupies the same position as complementizers
(3.5.7.3). -a is restricted to direct questions, while al may also be found in
embedded contexts:

'To do and undo everything; isn't that the law of this world?' [Etch.
Id. 1:336]There are also syntactic means to mark clauses as direct questions, in particular verb fronting:468 Syntax(821) Baretuko

their language?' [Etch. Id. 1:200]
The last two examples show that verb-fronting may cooccur with the interrogative particle al as well as the yes/no marker -a. As usual, a clause-initial
verb may be preceded in turn by any number of topicalized/scrambled elements and a focalized constituent. Since subjects tend to be topics and objects are often focalized (see Hualde et al.1994), this means that it is not
clear whether SOV sentences like the following exclusively involve interrogative intonation on a neutral word order or whether the object has been
focalized:
(824) Baina

(825) Musikak
music.ERG(...) gertakaribatadierazaldezake?eventaexpress(RAD)alAUX'Can music express an event?' [Mitx. EIG 1:50]Focalization 469
Verb-fronting is perhaps more clearly perceived in yes/no questions with
synthetic verbs. These are clitic-like elements which lean on the element to
their left and which cannot therefore occur in absolute initial position in a
main clause. Where verb-fronting to that position takes place, they are supplemented by the particle ba to their left:
(826)Ba al dugu musikan euskal
eskolarik?
ba al have music.in Basque school.PRTT
'Do we have any Basque school in music?' [Mitx. EIG 1:49](827) Baalduzueidazlanikaski?baalhavemanuscript.PRTTenough'Do you have enough manuscripts?' [Mitx. EIG 1:83]
Topics may occur to the left of the initial verb, which will then also appear
with ba- (828); however, this is not the case if a focalized constituent precedes it: that constituent 'counts' as first element to support the synthetic
verb, as in (829):
(828) Euskal doinuek
ba al dute
berezkotasunik?
Basque songs.ERG ba al have peculiarity.PRTT
'Do Basque songs have any peculiarities?' [Mitx. EIG 1:48]
(829)Kaltegarritzatal daukazuejoerahori?harmful.asaltendencythathave'Do you consider that tendency harmful?' [Mitx. EIG 1:86]4.4.3.2. Verb Focalization
Verb focalization stands out from the main focalization strategy described
in the preceding sections in that it seems to employ, at least in part, different
mechanisms. Since Altube (1929), a distinction has been drawn between
two types of 'verb focalization': a) cases where the event itself is emphasized, contrasting it with other type of events, and b) cases where 'the positive or negative quality of the verb is emphasized', i.e. where what is emphasized is that the action or state did take place or is true, as opposed to not
taking place or not being true. A priori, the contrastive overtones of the former seem more akin to the types of constituent focalization discussed in
section 4.4.2, while positive verbal emphasis falls fully in line with the
yes/no questions discussed in 4.4.3.1 However, both types of verb focaliza-470 Syntaxtion will be discussed in this section in order to prevent dispersion and to
facilitate a sharper distinction between the two. Contrastive event focalization will be dealt with in 4.4.3.2.1, and 4.4.3.2.2 will be devoted to polar
emphasis. Since negation presents additional problems which will be examined in section 4.4.7 below, we will concentrate here on positive polar emphasis.","[497, 498, 499, 500]"
"Nevertheless, this strategy has limited occurrence; it cannot be applied in
answers to questions, for instance. Thus, the previous example would be infelicitous as an answer to the question 'Who is that?'. This strategy is found
in narratives, with a pause after the verb, as if the element were dislocated
from the rest of the sentence. Leaving aside these cases, it can be stated that
in Lekeitio Basque there is a fixed position for the occurrence of a word or
phrase that constitutes new information in the sentence (see section 4.4.3.2
for more detailed information).

"AUXZU.PL.ERGThe preceding sentence is acceptable as a yes/no question on the matrix
verb galdetu 'ask', but not as a direct wh-question about nola 'how'. However, the same pied-piping structure is possible if the wh-word is emphasized. In that case the whole sentence is not a direct question: the embedded
clause is not behaving as a single interrogative constituent, but as a single
focalized element:

"4.4.6.1. Clausemate operators
This section examines sentences where more that one operator (focal or interrogative) occur in the same clause. Cooccurrence of foci with wh-words
and focalization in yes/no questions will be dealt with in turn.",[525]
"522 Syntax(1083) Horrelakoak
such.thingsnorkegin ezditu(ba)?who.ERGdoAUXsonot'Who didn't (ever) do such a thing?'
The same goes for exclamative clauses (see 4.6), which are constructed with
an overt complementizer even in matrix clauses. In exclamatives, negation
is always left adjacent to the finite auxiliary:
(1084) Zein ederra
den
etxe
hori!
how beautiful is.COMP house that
'How beautiful is that house!'
(1085) Zenbat
jende
ez den
etorri!
how.many people not AUX.COMP come
'How many people didn't come!'
In yes/no questions, negation and the auxiliary appear in the left-periphery,
as in declarative clauses. Optionally, the yes/no question particle al occurs
in between the two:
(1086) Ez (al) da
Xabier etorri?
not Q
AUX Xabier come
'Didn't Xabier come?'","[551, 552]"
"Focalization463It seems therefore that, at least for some of these strategies, emphasis need
not correspond to syntactic focalization.
Echo-questions usually respect left-adjacency with the verb, so that the
wh-word, rather than occupying the position it would in the basic declarative sentence, is typically moved to the pre-verbal position:
(802) -Zugandik atera dira kontu zikin guzti horiek.
you.from come AUX story dirty all
those
-Nigandik ZER atera dela?
me.from
what come AUX.that
'All those dirty stories have come from you. (That) what has come
from me?' [Atx. Ob.:64]

Jon. ERG story dirty all
those invent AUX
-Kontu horiek nork atera
ditu(ela)?
storythosewhoinventAUX(that)'Jon invented all those dirty stories. Who invented all those stories?'
The adjacency phenomena described above for foci and wh-words are fairly
conspicuous and recognized in traditional grammars of Basque. The behaviour or foci is sometimes claimed to be less strict than normative grammar
suggests, especially in narrative or discursive contexts (Michelena 1978,
Villasante's 1979 preface to the second edition of Altube 1929). It has also
been mentioned that the situation may be different depending on the dialects. With respect to the former remark, de Rijk (1996) has pointed out that
special effects obtained in narration by 'breaking' focalization rules presuppose the existence of such rules. As to the latter, dialectal differences will
certainly occur, but in the absence of detailed and reliable studies of focalization in most dialects, this is a fairly impressionistic criticism. In-depth
studies from this perspective only exist for western dialects, where the focalization strategies described below are generally held to be more robust:
Hualde et al. (1994) in fact describes a dialect with a more strict, rather than
looser, focalization system. In any event, the focalization (and certainly
question formation) strategies described in this chapter are generally respected in conversational style in western dialects, and, more or less consciously, in the standard written language. Section 4.4.8 below will present
some less standard patterns. Except where indicated otherwise, the grammatical system which will be described in this chapter corresponds to an464 Syntaxeducated standard central variety of the language close to Northern High
Navarrese (Iran).
In order to emphasize the essential similarities between focalization and
question formation, we will be discussing the two processes simultaneously.
Thus, we will consider wh-questions and non-verbal focalization under the
same heading (section 4.4.2), and include yes/no questions and whquestions, in a different joint section (section 4.4.3). Subconstituent question and focalization will be the topic of section 4.4.4, where different piedpiping possibilities are mentioned for operators inside different non-clausal
phrases. On the other hand, questions and focalization of elements inside
embedded clauses is discussed separately in section 4.4.5, whether the operator originating in an embedded clause is maintained there, as in indirect
questions, or moved to a different higher clause. Since both foci and interrogative elements seem to vie for the same pre-verbal 'position', an obvious
question which emerges is whether two or more wh-words, foci, or combination thereof are compatible, and this issue is addressed in section 4.4.6.
The special problems associated with focalization in negative clauses will
be examined in section 4.4.7. Finally, section 4.4.8 will deal with cases
where foci or wh-words occur in a position other than the immediately preverbal one.","[492, 493, 494]"

Uriagereka 1992); here is an example illustrative of this use:

The sentence nola izan ginen han Onatiko alkatearekin is perfectly translatable as 'that we were there with the mayor of Onati'; the speaker doesn't
mean that she remembers the way the event took place, but rather that the
event itself took place.
In yes-no questions, the suffix -en may form a more complex suffix incorporating what looks like the negation itself:

"To contribute a free-choice reading, we must add the prefix edo- (lit. 'or') or
the noun nahi 'desire' to the indefinite bases zer, nor and zein (3.1.6.1.4; for
the second option, cf. Sp cualquiera, etc):

nehor 'anybody'
inoiz

nehon 'anywhere'
inora
nihora 'anywhere' (direction)
The eastern forms behave differently in that they can directly convey a
negative meaning:
(1154) Nor etorri da? Nehor.

'Who came? No one.'
As indicated in 3.1.6.1.4, polarity items in Basque can be licensed by: (i)

(ix) 'affective' predicates (including exclamatory verbs and verbs of fearing) (1155i), (x) internal arguments of distributive universal quantifiers

"Like in Lekeitio and Tolosa, pronominal questions do not have a higher
pitch range than declaratives. The interrogative pronoun is the most prominent word in the utterance, after which there is a big drop in pitch level, and
the rest of the utterance has a reduced pitch range, close to the speaker's
baseline. Following pitch accents are almost imperceptible. This can be observed in Fig. 31, the F0 contour of the wh-question in (60):
(60)Norenadaliburuau?who.GEN.DET is book
'Whose is this book?'thisIntonation 111Figure 31.","[140, 141]"
"3.5.7. Modal particles
A small set of particles can be attached immediately to the left of the tensed
verbal form (whether auxiliary or synthetic verb) to modulate and validate
the information conveyed by the clause: omen 'hearsay information', ei
'hearsay information; Bizk.', bide 'apparently', al 'yes/no question; desiderative', ote 'rhetorical question'. These particles are mutually exclusive for
any single verb:
(455) Egia osoajakinomendu.truth whole know apparently AUX'He has apparently found out the whole truth.'
(456) Egia osoa omen daki.
knows'He apparently knows the whole truth.'
(457) ez otedadagoeneko istilunegAUXalreadyquarrelgarratzik sortuarlo honetan?bitterfield this.LOCappear'Have there not been bitter fights already in this area?'
[Mitx. EIG VII:156]
Nothing else may intervene between the tensed verbal form and the particle, and any process affecting the former will also affect the latter. Thus,
displacement of the tensed form to the left in negative clauses (4.5.2) or in
marked focalization structures in eastern dialects (4.4.2) carries modal particles with it:
(458) Asmatu, ez omen zuen hiruzpalau
inventnotAUX three.or.fourbaizik egin.
butmake'As for inventing, he has not apparently invented but three or four.'
[Mitx. EIG ΥΠ:32]Verbs 317(459) Aitak omen du
aurdiki.
father.ERG
AUX throw
'It was father who apparently threw it.' [Lafitte 1944, §117]
Modal particles are closely associated with inflection: they may not occur
in tenseless verbal forms, and pattern with inflection itself in that, unlike
other preverbal elements (such as negative ez or 'positive' ba) they do not
'count' as first elements shielding tensed forms from initial position (see
4.4.3). Contrast in this respect the following two examples:
(460) ez dator
not comes
's/he is not coming'
(461) *omen dator
comes
's/he is apparently coming'
As usual, presence of the morpheme ba can salvage the latter case (ote
used to be exceptional in this respect, as indicated in the following section).
There is further syntactic evidence that particles 'count' as inflection: they
are the only elements which may stand between the participle and its auxiliary in positive analytic verbal forms, and they are also the only elements
that may 'intervene' between the focalized element and a synthetic verb.
Phonetically, they also form an accentual group with the tensed verb
(Hualde et al. 1994).","[346, 347]"

To express exclusive disjunction or to coordinate focalized elements in

tends to choose the first one:

Absolute interrogative sentences present a higher overall pitch level than
declaratives, and display final lowering at the end. The verb or the word that
the yes/no question is being asked about presents a rise on the accented syllable (i.e., usually the penultimate), and there is no fall afterwards. Rather, a
high tone plateau follows until the stressed syllable of the last word in the
utterance, after which final lowering applies. This is illustrated in the F0
contour in Fig. 30, for sentence (59):

"4.10.3.1.7. Question-words within relative clauses
Since, as seen above, the Complex NP constraint applies in Basque in a
regular manner, a wh-word cannot be extracted from the relative in questions:
(1895)*Norijan dituzu [[aitak erosi dizkion]
sagarrak] ?
eat AUX
father buy AUX.COMP apples
'Whom did you eat the apples Dad bought for?'
who.DAT(1896) Nori
who.DATnahizenuke[[erosdiezazkiodan]wanthave.POTbuy(RAD)AUX(SUBJ).COMPsagarrak] ?
apples
'Who do you want me to buy apples for?'
In (1896) the wh-word is extracted from the subjunctive complement, and
the example is perfect. This is not the case in (1895), because the wh-word
is extracted from the relative included within the complex NP.
However, provided there is no extraction, NPs within relatives can be
question words. In this case pied-piping (4.4.5.3) is obligatory:786Syntax(1897) [{Νorkzuzendu duen]
lanaz]
mintzatu
who.ERG direct
AUX.COMP
work.INSTR speak
'The work that who directed did they speak about?'","[815, 816]"
"2.3.3.2. Intonational division of an utterance
One important word-order feature that distinguishes the variety of Baztan
from the varieties of Tolosa and Lekeitio is that main prosodic prominence
can appear postverbally more frequently in Baztan than in the other two varieties. When the whole utterance is new information, not only in narratives
but also as an answer to a question such as 'What happened?\ the constituent with the most prominent pitch accent appears postverbally. Thus, an answer to the question 'What happened?' could be the one in (57):Intonation109(57) Mirenek
gan du
liburüe.
Miren.ERG take AUX book
'Miren has taken the book.'
This sentence could also be uttered within a narrative discourse, where the
direct object liburüe 'the book' is focalized or constitutes new information.
The intonational pattern of Baztan Basque is very similar to the one described for the dialect of Tolosa (although the position of the accented syllable within the word is different). All constituents preceding the one carrying
main prosodic prominence end in a rising intonation (that is, they have a
peak on the final syllable, i.e., the post-tonic). The phrase or constituent
with main prosodic prominence is identified not by its position, but by being
the phrase containing the only word with a fall in pitch after the accented
syllable and by being in the portion of the utterance with a lower pitch level
or pitch range.
In instances of preverbal focalization, the portion of the utterance following the focalized constituent has a much more reduced pitch range than the
preceding portion of the utterance, and it is this feature that triggers the perception of main prominence. In fact, even the stress on the auxiliary observable in (57) is absent in preverbal focalization instances such as the one in
(58) (cf. Fig. 29):
(58) Liburüe gan du
Mirenek.
book
take AUX Miren.ERG
'Miren has taken the book.'

Introduction
J. I. Hualde1.1. The Basque language and its name
The word 'Basque' derives, through French, from the name of the Vascones, a nation or tribe that in Roman times occupied an area of the Iberian
Peninsula including most of present-day Navarre and neighboring parts of
Aragon. Whereas, on the one hand, possibly not all Vascones were Basquespeaking (both non-Indo-European Iberian and Indo-European Celtiberian
appear to have been used in parts of their territory) and, on the other hand,
Pre-Basque and related languages seem to have been also spoken by some
other neighboring nations (at least the Aquitanians in Gaul, see Gorrochategui 1995), in medieval times the name Vascones became identified
with the speakers of the direct ancestor of the language we know as Basque.
The traditional name for the Basque language in Spanish is vascuence, derived from Latin uasconice '(to speak) in the Vasconic way', which is parallel to and was opposed to romance < romanice 'in the Roman way'. In postRenaissance Spain, the name vizcaino, strictly speaking only the westernmost dialect of Basque, became for several centuries a frequent designation
for the Basque language and its speakers.
The Basques call their language euskara (and dialectal variants: euskera,
eskuara, iiskara, auskera, etc.). Euskara is opposed to erdara (or erdera)
'foreign language', used to refer to Spanish on the southern side of the political border and to French on the other side. Both words have an ending
which very likely derives from the word era 'manner', used as a suffix in
many words, such as ibilera 'way of walking' (from ibil-i 'to walk'), etc. In
erdara the first element appears to be erdi 'half. Etymologically erdara
would thus be 'a half way of speaking', 'something that is not fully a language'; a not unusual way to characterize a foreign language. On the other
hand, the original meaning of the root eusk- in euskara is less clear. Among
the proposed etymologies we find the name of the Ausci, a Pyrenean tribe in
Roman times, and the reconstructed verb *enau(t)s-i 'to speak' (Irigoyen
1977, 1990).","[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

'Nowhere was any trace of them. Not in the bars, not around the village, not in the forest.' [Atx. Ob.: 190]

'No, he was not in the street, but at home.' [Atx. Ob.·.292]
However, de Rijk (1996b) shows that positions other than the final one may
be contrasted:
(1033) Nikez daukat dirurik
orain zuretzat, bai,

instead love
Ί don't have any money for you now, but [I have] love, instead.'
I.ERGNotice that the main identificational criterion for this quasifocus position
comes from the availability of contrastive tags like the preceding ones, under the assumption that a constituent that admits them is a pragmatic focus
perhaps associated with some syntactic position. However, this assumption
may not be warranted, since contrastive tags seem to be available for a wide
range of positions. Thus, Osa (1990) gives as acceptable all of the following
alternatives, not just the first one (corresponding to the quasifocus position):
(1034) Ez da
aita
etorri, ama
baizik.
not AUX father come mother but
(pre-participial constituent)
'Father has not come, but mother.'
(1035) Aita

da
etorri,
ama
baizik.
(pre-negation constituent without contrastive stress)
Ez
da etorri
aita,

(post-participial constituent)
This contrastive quasifocus is thus very different from the regular structural
focus of negative questions and positive clauses. Let us examine now fur-512 Syntaxther similarities and differences between focus and quasifocus, other than
the semantic and positional differences discussed above.","[541, 542]"

"472SyntaxAs indicated above, the usage of this particle seems to be a reflection of the
clitic status of synthetic forms, which usually lean on a host to their left.
Such element is missing in clause-initial position, and the particle ba is then
used to support the conjugated verbal form. From this perspective, this particle typically appears as a consequence of verb-fronting, rather than as a
marker of focalization per se. At least since Altube (1929), it has often been
assumed that the particle ba itself is the marker of positive emphasis, an
analysis supported by the relation of this element to the positive particle bai
'yes'. However, this does not explain its restriction to synthetic verbal forms
and, more importantly, disregards the usage of ba in other contexts where
verb fronting takes place, such as yes/no questions (see section 4.4.3.1
above) and existential sentences like the following:
(835) Bada Sein Floreten Pillardit izeneko fraile
ba.is St.
Floret.in
name.of friar
doktrino
bat.
preaching one
'There is in St. Floret a preaching friar called Pillardit.'
[Lertx. O.P.:390]
Sometimes different factors may be combined: in the last example there
could be a contrastive emphasis on the existential verb. See Oyhar^abal
(1984), Rebuschi (1982) for more details on this particle.
The absence of ba makes positive emphatic analytical forms less conspicuous, and Altube (1929:57) claimed that these are exclusively marked
by focal stress. Euskaltzaindia (1985) points out verb initiality as an important syntactic property. However, given the availability of scrambling to the
left of the clause, this property is often anything but salient. Some examples
are given below:
(836) Etabukatuzuten gizonekberenlana.andfinishAUXtheirworkmen.ERG'And the men did finish their work.' [Atx. 06.:39]

godiraenarak,hasidanegua.","[501, 502]"
"Pronominal questions also have an overall high pitch level, but unlike absolute echo-questions there is a clear and sharp fall after the interrogative
pronoun carrying main prominence. Another characteristic of pronominal
echo questions is that they are pronounced with final raising intonation (cf.
Fig. 17):
A r ftΗΗΑA ΛIΛΗR- <uIWiliyiÄ m t

"4.4.4. Subconstituent questions and focalization
4.4.4.1. Questions and foci inside noun phrases
Foci and wh-words embedded within other constituents cause the latter to
occur pre-verbally. Thus, in the following examples the whole noun phrase474 Syntaxmust occur pre-verbally if any of its subconstituents is given focal emphasis:
(842)[JONEN/NOREN etxekoteilatuak]izandituitoginak.","[503, 504]"
"2.3.1.3.3. Echo-questions
The main characteristic of echo-questions is their overall high pitch level. In
absolute echo-questions, after the word with main prominence (i.e., the
word which in the original declarative utterance that is being repeated had
main prominence) the fall in pitch is not the same as in declaratives or absolute interrogatives, and the high pitch level is maintained throughout the utterance (cf. Fig. 16, illustrating the contour for sentence 43). Indeed, in
some speakers' utterances there is no fall after the word that would have
main prominence in the declarative, even if the word is accented, and the
pitch level is high throughout. The high pitch level is maintained until the
end, when final lowering applies, and by virtue of the combination of the
high pitch level and final lowering even unaccented words ending an echoquestion appear as if they were assigned a pitch accent (cf. Fig. 16). Lengthening of final syllables also applies in absolute echo-questions, like in their
non-echo counterparts:Intonation 97(43) Umiä erun dau mendira?

This strategy corresponds to the equivalent negative question structure mentioned in 4.4.7.1. See references quoted there.",[537]
"4.1.2. Intransitive monovalent structures
4.1.2.1. Simple existence

the verb izan 'be' as a lexical verb, in statements of existence:

'To be or not to be, that's the question.'",[394]
"4.4.6. Wh- and focus compatibility
Since wh-words and non-verbal foci may occupy the pre-verbal position, it
is important to consider whether, in general, focalization is compatible with
interrogation. We will address this issue first with respect to focalization+interrogation inside a single clause, turning later to examine the compatibility of the two in different clauses of the same sentence. Multiple
questions and multiple foci will be considered in section 4.4.6.3.",[525]
"2.3.2.3. Intonational contours of nondeclarative sentences.
As in Lekeitio, absolute interrogative sentences present intonational contours which look rather similar to those of declaratives: there is a word with106PhonologyFigure 26.main prosodic prominence, which can be a word immediately preceding the
verb or the verb itself, and there is no final raising. As in declaratives, main
prominence is cued by a high tone followed by a fall in pitch on the following syllable, and the region in the utterance after the main stress has a
smaller pitch range. Absolute interrogatives have a higher pitch level than
declaratives, but only until the most prominent word; after it, the range falls
to levels similar to those of declaratives. This means that the pitch fall after
the most prominent word is bigger in interrogatives than in declaratives.
Unlike in Lekeitio, however, no significant final lengthening was observed
at the end of interrogative utterances. Fig. 27 illustrates the F0 contour of
sentence (55):
(55)Jitn aldaamonamendi(r)a?go Q AUX grandma mountain.ALL
'Has grandma gone to the mountain?'
Pronominal questions present a similar pattern to the one found in
Lekeitio, that is, they have falling intonation at the end (like absolute interrogatives and declaratives), and do not have a higher pitch range than declaratives. The interrogative pronoun is the most prominent word in the utterance, and the peak for the interrogative pronoun reaches F0 values which
are higher than a word in a declarative sentence would reach in the same position, i.e., (usually) at the beginning of the utterance. This means that pronominal questions have a bigger pitch range at the beginning. After the interrogative pronoun there is a big drop in pitch level, and the rest of theIntonation107Figure 27.utterance has a reduced pitch range, such that following accents have very
small peaks.
As in Lekeitio, among younger speakers of Tolosa Basque it is possible
to find pronunciations of interrogative sentences with final raising intonation, probably influenced by Spanish.
Repeat or echo-questions in Tolosa present similar features to those described above for Lekeitio Basque in 2.3.1.3.3. They have an overall high
pitch level, which in absolute echo-questions is maintained throughout the
utterance. At the end there is a slight final lowering. As for exclamatives
and exhortatives, these types of utterances present the same basic characteristics described for Lekeitio above.
As pointed out in section 2.3.1.3.5, in most European languages continuatives or unfinished utterances are characterized by a final rising intonation.
Although in Lekeitio this does not hold, in Tolosa we observe final raising
at the end of adverbial clauses and topic phrases separated from the rest of
the utterance by a pause or strong juncture. This pattern is illustrated in Fig.
28, for sentence (56).
(56)Giireamonaeldiida-nen,amä(g)anajiinge(r)a.our grandma arrive AUX-when mother, ALL go AUX
'When our grandma arrived, we went to our mother.'","[135, 136, 137]"
"It is an open question, however, whether this is a case of true subordination
(cf. Villasante 1979:194) and not simple coordination.",[759]
"Here are some examples of tenseless indirect questions:

"4.4.6.3. Multiple questions and multiple foci
This section examines the possibility of finding more than one wh-word or
focus in the same clause (4.4.6.3.1) or in different clauses (4.4.6.3.2).
4.4.6.3.1. Multiple clausemate operators
This section addresses the question of the grammaticality of multiple operators in the same clause. We will differentiate three different possibilities,
depending on whether the multiple operators are foci (4.4.6.3.1.1), whwords (4.4.6.3.1.2), or whether the operator group originates as a consequence of raising operators from a lower clause into a clause already containing some (4.4.6.3.1.3).",[527]

These -t(z)eko non-finite constituents may optionally take the partitive determiner in the same contexts that a regular noun phrases does: if the governing verb is negated, if it is part of a yes-no question, or if it is embeded in
a conditional sentence (c-d, from Arejita 1984:108, in Bizkaian):672 Syntax(1554) a.","[701, 702]"

'... that I do not live here ALONE, that I live with Meharra and

arises, and, in fact, there does not seem to be any major semantic difference
between this focalization position and the one to the left of negation:

This type of post-auxiliary focalization (quasifocus in de Rijk's 1996b terminology) may also be found with synthetic verbal forms, but given the absence of any participle, the position occupied by the emphasized element is
harder to chart. Some examples with synthetic forms are given below. As
the first example shows, where several constituents follow, the contrast (or
the reinforcement if the emphasized constituent is a polarity element) is
usually established with the last one:Focalization 511(1031) Ez

"4.5.4. Negative constituents
4.5.4.1. Negative polarity items
Negative polarity items in Basque are built on words which are homonymous with the question words, by the addition of a prefix e- (>i- by dissimilation) (Michelena 1985[1961]: 67, 304), probably related to negation ez
'in-, not, no' (3.1.6.1.4):
(1149) a. i-nor
b. i-noiz
c. i-non
d. i-nora
e. e-zer
f. e-zein + Ν'anybody'
'ever'
'anywhere (location)'
'anywhere (direction)'
'anything'
'any n' (literary)Although these polarity items seem to incorporate morphologically a negative element, for most speakers, they don't have a negative value by themselves. They need the presence of an independent clausemate negation, as
shown by the contrast in (1150):Negation(1150) Zer

"2.3.1.3.2. Pronominal (or Wh-) interrogative sentences
Like absolute interrogatives and declaratives, pronominal questions present
a falling intonation at the end. Unlike absolute interrogatives, they do not
have a higher pitch range than declaratives, however, and do not have longer
final syllables. The interrogative pronoun is always accented, and is the
most prominent element in the utterance. After the interrogative pronoun
there is a big fall in pitch level, and the pitch range is reduced, such that following lexical pitch accents have almost imperceptible peaks. This is alsoIntonation95Figure 13.","[124, 125]"
"Subordination799Both examples in (1929) have the same meaning, though an indirect question is used in the first one (a), and an instrumental generic relative clause in
the second one (b) (oroit izan 'remember' subcategorizes for instrumental
NPs). Both constructs are well formed, and their meanings are similar.
However, with other verbs, like for instance ahantzi 'forget', the distinction
between both constructions can be made clearer, though the translation
would still be similar in English (differing in whether what is stressed or
not):
(1930) a. Ahantzi dut [zer ekarri behar nuen].
forget
AUX what bring
must AUX.COMP
b. Ahantzi dut
[ekarri behar nuena].
forget
AUX bring
must AUX.COMP.DET
Ί have forgotten what I should bring.'
The verb ahantzi 'forget' subcategorizes for both indirect questions and absolutive NPs. However, the meanings are not the same in both cases: in (a),
the speaker says that he doesn't remember which object he should have
brought. In (b), he indicates that he forgot the object he should bring.","[828, 829]"
"Wh-questions occasionally licence partitive phrases; however, more than
genuine questions these are rhetorical expressions which negate what they
formally inquire about:
(85) Nola eros

how buy.RAD car.PRTT money.PRTT without
'How can one buy a car without any money?'
(d) The previous example also shows that it can optionally be attached to an
object of the postposition gäbe 'without'; see also besterik gäbe 'without anything else', 'without further ado'.
(e) Some speakers allow partitives in existential sentences (as in [a]; note
the singular verb-form). This seems to be possible especially when an
adjective modifies the head noun. An emphatic existential interpretation
is also found with partitives used with non-existential predicates (b), (c):
(86) a. Bada hemen neska ederr-ik.

'There are (some) beautiful girls here.'

[Mitx. EIG 1:138]
As Laka (1990:213, citing Saltarelli 1988) has pointed out, within the
same dialect, a governing negative verb may accept a finite clause headed
by both -ela or by -enik, but there will be a difference in presupposition:
when headed by the former, the speaker presupposes that the proposition
expressed by the finite clause is a true fact, but no such presupposition is
made when headed by -enik (Laka 1990:214):
(1474)Gurealabaketdusinestenlurraourdaughter.ERGnotAUXbelieve.lMPFearthegutkiareninguruandabilelaldabilenik.sun. GENaroundwalk,ela/walk.enik'Our daughter doesn't believe that the earth revolves around the

and two four arc.ela say.ten
'We are not being told night and day that two and two are four.'
[Mitx. EIG 1:143]Subordination 645In example (1475) the author, Κ. Mitxelena, is taking for granted that two
and two are four; and in (1474), when -ela is used we presuppose that the
earth truly revolves around the sun regardless of our daughter's beliefs,
whereas no such presupposition is made with the form -enik. Laka
(1990:214) and Uribe-Etxebarria (1994:173) suggest that a sentence headed
by -enik is necessarily interpreted within the scope of negation, whereas the
opposite would be true of a sentence headed by -ela. See 4.5.4.4.
It is hard not to see that this -enik suffix looks like the combination of the
-en (be it relative or interrogative) plus the partitive determiner -rik. Two
pieces of data confirm this suspicion: just like in the case of the partitive determiner, a yes-no matrix question may reportedly trigger the use of -enik
(instead of the more general -ela) as the head of the embedded noninterrogative clause:
(1476) a.","[673, 674, 675]"
"Aitor.ERG Miren.DAT giveAUXmoney'Aitor has given the money to Miren.'
In a sentence in which two or more unaccented words are contained in a
syntactic phrase occurring immediately before the verb, only the rightmost
word may have main prosodic prominence. Thus, a sentence such as (22) is
ill-formed in Lekeitio Basque (cf. the well-formed [23], with the intended
meaning):
(22) *Neure
mysemienetxia ikusi dot.son.GENhouse see AUXΊ have seen my son's house.'
(23) Neure semien etxiä ikusi dot.
This restriction on accent assignment for unaccented words gives rise to
a mismatch between pragmatic or informational focalization and prosodic
focalization, as they may not coincide in these contexts. Indeed, one could
imagine a context in which the word semien were the most prominent element in the utterance from an informational point of view, as it corresponds
to the inquired element in a question such as (24), for example. Still, (22) is
ill-formed, and the response would have to be uttered as in (23):
(24) Norenetxiaikusi dosu?who.GEN friend seeAUX'Whose house have you seen?'
In the same manner, (23) could represent the prosodic pattern of a sentence
with wide focus or completely new information, or a sentence where only
etxia 'the house' were the focalized constituent. To express focus on the
genitive rephrasing would be required; e.g.: semienä ikusi dot Ί have seen
the one of the son'.
Interestingly, multiple foci type of questions would not constitute triggers
of multiple prosodic prominence in this case. Thus, the correct answer to86Phonology(25) is (26) (=[23]), not (27). This indicates that it is not possible to have
more than one word with prosodic prominence within a phrase:
(25) Es tot entendidu. Noren
not AUX understand whosesir ikusi dosu?
what see AUXΊ haven't understood. Whose what have you seen?'
(26) Neure semien etxid ikusi dot.
(27) *Neure semien etxid ikusi dot.
On the other hand, when there is one or more lexically accented words in
the preverbal phrase, the first accented word in the phrase is usually perceived by native speakers as the most prominent word prosodically. Thus, in
(28) it is the word lagunen 'of the friends' that is perceived as the most
prominent word in the utterance, even if the sentence were uttered as a response to a question such as 'What did you do today?', 'What did you
take?', or 'What that belongs to the friends did you take?', i.e., when the
context makes it clear that the whole utterance, the whole phrase lagunen
liburuak 'the friends' books' or liburuak 'books' is the inquired or new information:II ιg i
