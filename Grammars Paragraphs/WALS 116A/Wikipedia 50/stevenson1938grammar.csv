FORMATION OF MOODS lllill TEfI§;8S.
From the foregoing paradigms it will be seen that all moods
and tenses, except the Dependent Past, are built uJ?()n the Present
Singular.
Verbs which are formed from different stems are
.
exception~.
Irregularities in other verbs will be noted as they
occur.
In regular verbs, if the Present, singUlar is knovm, any Person
in any mood or tense may be ascertained.
DiffiCUlty is crea.ted,
kPmumpin some tenses b~r alternative terminations, the rules for
which he,ve not ;)ret been fUll~~ V!o::'ked out.
The HIP3l!\.TIVE ma~r (;:1.0. in -i or -e.

~ with the Present maJT often be translated by the English Po.st 1
as it is used in preference to the Past tense ( in -on, -un, etc.)
in conv~rsation:shiladu ~ feadiThe chief tharuced hima yo::f.a toileIaiji kw?ro nyala ka niWe killed one foula V'~ ~aro ka tilidiI called the womensaVI you yesterdayThe Past tenses of the above are:,shiladu ka feadun
a yo~a tolun,

To express the futur~, ka is separated from the present tense of
the verb by its obj ect or by o.n an adverb:

arjika budarau SOl""I shall eat meat to-norrow
