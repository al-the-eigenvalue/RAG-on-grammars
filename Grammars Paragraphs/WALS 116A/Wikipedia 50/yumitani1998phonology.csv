Verbs tend to be incorporated or compounded when they occur with [fi6hY@]'how'. In (151) and (152), the incorporative form of transitive verbs combines with
transitive P@/ 'do something' to form compound verbs, and in (153) and (154)' theperfective form of intransitive verbs is compounded to intransitive /p6/ 'act, behave'.

As the above examples show, the interrogative words are almost alwaysfollowed by the question particle [h@] in this position. This is also the case with (143)
and ( 144a) below. However, when the interrogative form occurs in an embedded
question, the question particle does not occur. The clause in (144b),which is a direct
question, has the interrogative particle /h&/.

33N tends to be palatalized after /e/. The question particle [hw is historically derived
from W@/.
In fact, one of my consultants occasionally says [fikkhY&],instead of
[fi6hY$]. It explains why L-effect takes place, changing [h] to [E], as in example (138),

"The class membership of the quantified noun does not predict which variant occurs.
However, though the examples are few, we can perhaps say that [khy4]is used in
questions of quantity, as in (128c) through (128e) above.",[158]
"As we listened to the tape later, she said that she had meant to say [Sbnq'e] 'always'

(24)This sentence contains three Spanish loanwords: pi-v&]'grapes' (uva),[s~dkya]'watermelon' (sandfa), and [bal8*nq]'muskrne1on' (rneldnes). This and
other Jemez speakers pronounce the inverse form for the word for 'watermelon' with a
final [e] (i.e. [sqdkye]).
(27)Another consonant alternation, [kb] to [h] (in the particle [ha]), is seenhere. (See also sentences (30) and (37) below.) The question particle [h$] may have
contained an initial FhY]
in the past. Another consultant occasionally says [fi6khy&]
'how', instead of [fikhy&]. This possibility is also supported by the existence of the
interrogative word [seE$] 'who'. The word consists of /SW 'who, someone' and the
question particle, and exhibits an apparent case of L-effect. (/khY/

underlying /I/.)

It should be noted that there is some variation among the speakers. The
alternations (85a), (85c), and (85e), are found in the speech of all my main consultants,
but (85b) and (85d) are observed in only one speaker. The consonants that undergo
this process are regrouped as (86) and (87) below.
46Note that some surface [h] are derived historically from /khyl,and are affected by the
:-effect rule: e.g. [h&] 'question particle' < /khy&l.Another example of the alternation
between WY/and [h] is the tense-aspect particle /khYa/.",[88]
"There are still questions regarding the internal relationship of the language
family. Some linguists-for
(1967)-suggestedinstance, Irvine Davis (1959) and George Tragerthat the family had first split into Kiowa and Tanoan. Others hintedthat this might not be the case. Watkins writes that ""the label Kiowa-Tanoan reflects an
obvious cultural division rather than a linguistic one"" (1984:2).1 (See also Paul
Kroskrity ( 1993:56-57).)
It is not certain if there was any other language in the Towa sub-group. It has
been generally assumed that Pecos spoke another dialect of Towa. Harrington wrote
that Jemez and Pecos were two dialects of the Towa language:
It was also suggested that the dialects of group B be known as constituting the
Towa language, since the term tdwa, meaning ""native,"" is applied by the Jemez
and Pecos to their own language. (Harrington 1910a: 13)
However, the Jemez historian, Joe Sando, rejects this assumption: ""What few words
are known of the Pecos language sound more Tewa than Towa"" (1982: 149).","[18, 19]"

the successive vowels; the second assigns both tones to the remaining vowel.","[99, 100, 101]"
"When P is a Class IV noun, normally only the basic-number prefixes (i.e./a-/,/Q-/,/e-/) are used. There is no basicfinverse distinction reflected in the transitiveprefixes for Class N nouns. However, a few mass nouns in Class TV occur with both
the basic-number and the plural prefixes which also cooccur with some nouns ofClasses I, 11 and m.considering that Class IV are mass nouns, the term 'plural
prefix' may not be totally appropriate, but it is used here to refer to these verbal
prefixes. (See the next section for a discussion of the plural prefixes.)

"Even when a syllable-final consonant occurs on the surface, there is a tendency
toward a CV template in the language, i.e. a tendency toward eliminating a closed
syllable in favor of an open syllable. For instance, the 'inverse' suffix /-Uis often
omitted from the noun stem, and when it does occur before a verb stem with a
pronominal prefix, speakers usually pause slightly between the noun stem and the
suffix, and pronounce [S] and the following vowel (i.e. the initial vowel of the
pronominal prefix on the verb) as one syllable: e.g. [v8*la:Sijq 'Men (du) fell off' <
/v&la-S P-Si/ (man-inv intr[3du]-fall.sg/pf). In the early 1920's Elsie Clews Parsons'
(Parsons 192570) transcription [ywa' kishi sernihy] 'your children send' suggests
that the pronominal verbal prefix [i] was already phonetically bound to the inverse
number suffix [-sh] in [kjshi].)
Word-internally, closed syllables are not possible in present-day Jemez, but it
appears that there used to be a consonant cluster of word-medial [t] plus a stop
consonant in the language: [pdpa'] '(term for) September-October' (Parsons 1925:75).
Although long consonants also occur, they are not contrastive. Voiceless stops,
particularly lpl, N and Ity/,are lengthened if the preceding vowel is short and stressed:
e.g. 14itYimv[@itYtYirnd
'weak';lsipaeyd [sippaeya] 'marry'. l l
There is a remaining question of whether Jemez has true vowel-initial syllables.
What appear to be syllable-initial vowels in some roots start at a low pitch level, the
pitch quickly rising as the vowel is pronounced. Often a voiced glottal fricative [fi] is
heard before the vowel: e.g. [fii.p7ae] 'yesterday'. l2 ' [fi] is present at least in rootinitial syllables. Hale (1967) points out that in all the Kiowa-Tanoa languages except
1lThe double consonant symbols here indicate long consonants; they do not mean
rearticulated geminate consonants.
l2Laurel Watkins (personal communication) observes a similar low-high tonal pattern
on syllable-initial vowels and on vowels which follow an initial voiced consonant, and
argues that there is a voiced laryngeal /W at the beginning of what appear to be vowelinitial syllables.","[38, 39]"

"CHAPTER 3. NOUN MORPHOLOGY3.0. IntroductionNouns are one of the two major word classes in Jemez. They participate in an
elaborate number-based classification system. Many of them are inflected for number
and take an inflectional suffix. The choice of demonstratives is determined by thenumber and class of nouns. These characteristics define them as the class of nouns. A
general introduction to the Jemez noun classification system is given in Section 3.4.1.
pronominal prefixes in Section 3.4.2, and dernonstratives in Section 3.5.
All the examples in this and the next chapters are surface forms except when the
underlying representation is relevant, in which case both the surface and underlying
forms are provided. (The underlying forms are enclosed between slashes / /.)3.1. Roots and stemsStems typically consist of a single root (l),a root and a suffix (2), or more than
one root (3). Most noun stems contain one to three syllables; disyllabic stems are the
most common.

"1313.7.4. Double marking for possessiveOccasionally Jemez speakers mark the possessor twice with different
mechanisms. In (106a), the possessor is marked by both a relativized verb of position
with incorporated kin term and a transitive benefactive prefix on the main verb. (106b)
shows an alternative construction with a simple transitive prefix on the main verb.","[148, 149]"

appear regardless of the class membership of the nouns: e.g. [p&--S?fla:i-bin] 'The

"2.3. Phonotactics2.3.1. Syllable structure and types
The most common syllable types in Jemez are CV and CVV.10 Closed
syllables ending with a consonant, either [S] or [I], do occur in surface forms, but only
word-finally before a pause. All the possible syllable types are shown along with
examples in (3).

CWC[figs] 'cottontail rabbits'[wi-l]'four'10In the discussion of the syllable structure, V is used to represent a short vowel, and
VV a long vowel. Thus CV refers to an open syllable with a short vowel, while CVV
represents an open syllable with a Iong vowel.",[38]

but the pronominal prefix, except for the final /l/,
does not appear when /die/ is used, as
in (184). (See Section 4.10.2.1 for a further discussion of Id=/.)Finally, the incorporative form occurs in verb compounding and incorporation
( 189) as well as in negative commands ( I go)-( 191). As is seen in examples ( 190) and(191), the incorporative form, when used as a negative imperative, does not occur with
any pronominal prefix. [mq] is a variant of /m@/'no, without, out o f , which is
suffixed to nouns.

There is considerable irregularity in the active verb inflection. However, most
of the transitive verbs in my data can be grouped into nine morphological classes
according to the shared inflectional patterns? Two of these, which I call G7 and G10
verbs are rather small classes, consisting of only a few verbs. One of the features24Throughout the discussion on the inflected forms, the verb classes are referred to
with the prefix 'G'(for 'group') followed by a number, e.g. 'G7','G5-3b'. The
classification and numbering of the verbs are first presented in Section 4.8.2.2, and a
subset of the data appears in Table 19.","[212, 213, 214]"

and L appears in non-initial position where the surface F is not possible. In fact, two

and the H tone was lowered to L in [me-Samq] 'loadpotn', the underlying contrast in
these examples is between underlying F and H rather than F and L. Although surface F

"Both H and L can occur after H in roots. It is not possible to predict what tone (H orL) will occur in the second syllable of disyllabic roots whose initial syllable carries H
tone, e.g. [w&pil 'nit', [@bpi]'brown'. Thus these two surface tones must be marked
underlyingly. H (0)
and M (9)on short vowels must also be marked in underlying
representation because they are found after H in disyllabic stems, e.g. [tb-sC] 'hit/potn9, '
[tb-s'e] 'hit/pf'. H and F contrast, e.g. [ail 'sore', [ail 'buckskin', [w&tpb]'be quiet',
[wS-t%] 'be cold'. It seems that the surface M and L tones must also be distinguishedsince they occur in minimal pairs, e.g. [khY&?n8

'loan/pf', [m@Sama;] 'loan/potn, go to borrowlpf.27
On the other hand, surface F and M tones on short vowels do not contrast: theyare in complementary distribution. F normally occurs in the initial syllable of lexical
stems, while M appears non-initially. When monosyllabic roots with F tone occur as
the right-most members in compounds, their tone changes to M in surface

"Final C = verb root-final consonantsThe passive stems (i.e. perfective, potentid, imperfective) have the same tonal
pattern, except for a small subset of G5-3a verbs.
The verbs in G7 and G10 contain a different consonant (i.e. /b/)in the final
'feed/pf'
syllable of the passive stems: e.g. [kw5*?yb]
'slaplpf'- [kw6-p7i]'feed/psv.pf , [pij.ni-]- [p@pTz]'slap/psv.pf'. ([ntjpiyt.] 'teachlpf has two passive perfectiveforms-[nQpi3yk] and [nQpip3k]--of which the former is more common.)
It is quite possible that there are more verb classes. Table 19 lists 19 groups,and many of them may turn out to be valid classes. However, only nine of them can be
identified as inflectional classes with some certainty. Groups other than these nine
contain too few examples or irregularity within them. For instance, there are at least
two types found in the imperative forms of Gl-l verbs (e.g. [mfwi] 'see', [SG-wi]
'break something') and the incorporative forms of G1-2 verbs (e.g.[m&se] 'give', [hq
'kill'). G2-1 consists of only one verb, [m/.]
'bring (pf/potn)', in my data.
Sprott (1992) claims that the full paradigm of most verbs can be obtained if we
know four stem forms, i.e. active perfective, active imperfective, passive perfective,passive imperfective. He writes that ""These four forms must simply be memorized;
there is no sure way of getting from one to any of the other three"" (1 992: 144), and he
seems to suggest that the other three stems in the active paradigm, i.e. imperative,
potential (his 'optative'), and incorporative ('negative imperative'), can all be derived
from the perfective (1992: 148-149). The difference between my conclusions and
Sprott's on verb inflection may be attributed to three factors. First, I have paid close
attention to tones and grouped verbs into 19 classes according to the tonal patterns of
the potential and perfective stems. Second, I have analyzed systematically the-alternation between consonants: e.g. [b] [m]- [p?], [d] - [n] - [t?], and determinedtheir phonological conditions while setting up a single underlying consonant fromwhich the other(s) can be derived. Third, I have proposed the analysis that most verbs
have an underlying root-final consonant.
My preliminary conclusion on transitive active verb inflection is as follows: to
obtain the full paradigm of a verb, we need to have five pieces of information on a
verb, (a) the morphological class of the verb, (b) the verb root, (c) the active perfective
stem, (d) the detransitive (passive) stem, and (e) the active imperative form. The active
potential stem is predictable from the active perfective stem in all but four classes, and
three of the the four are small classes. The (active) incorporative stem, at least the
segmental shape, of verbs except those in G8,can be predicted from the perfective.
The imperfective stem is also predictable if we know the verb root-final consonant andthe tonal pattern of the perfective stem, except for verbs in the small classes of G7, G92, G10.
Inflection in the detransitive paradigm is regular, and it is possible to derive the
perfective, imperfective and potential forrns from a single detransitive stem with an
underlying tonal pattern, namely, we would not have to list the passive perfective and
imperfective forms. The only difference between the passive and active stems is the
tonal pattern, and the vast majority of verbs have regular, predictable tones (m/or
/ID?/>in the passive stem, so if we only know which verbs of G5-3a have anomaloustones, we can obtain the passive paradigm of all transitive verbs. (See Section
4.8.3.1.)It might even be possible to derive all the inflected stems, including the
imperative, from one underlying verb root as long as the class membership of the verb
is known. However, we still need to work out the details of verb classes before we can
determine the validity of such a claim. A complete paradigm for each of the nine verb
classes is provided in Appendix 4 ""Transitive verb paradigms.""","[237, 238, 239]"

HaIe (1967: 1 13) describes as ""the rnorphophonemic ablauting of certain verb steminitial consonants under specific morphosyntactic conditions."" In Jemez, three such
conditions are identified: (a) verb compounding and incorporation; (b) nominalization;(c) detransitivization (i.e. formation of intransitive verbs from transitive verbs of similar
semantic content such as 'open/intransitive' and 'opedtransitive' ). The consonants
which alternate under these conditions are listed in (57). The first consonant in each

three.

for the plural. All the examples of this type are verbs of position, shown in (6) - (10).
The occurrence of different stems is independent of the inflectional categories

l .I . Jemez Pueblo ..........................................................................................",[9]
"In HaIe (1972), he advocates a more active involvement of American Indians in
linguistic research, and by way of illustrating the merit of such an effort, he provides
some morphosyntactic data on Jemez, such as passive voice and noun incorporation.
Constance Martin (1964) briefly discusses tones and syllables, and provides a
detailed description of Jemez sounds. However, its scope is limited to (classical)
phonemics: she derives the consonant and vowel phonemes by checking if particular
sounds 'contrast' in analogous environments. She overlooks the fact that some
consonants have a very limited but systematic distribution, and as a result, she comes
up with more consonant 'phonemes' than necessary.
Beatrice Myers and Hazel Shorey studied Jemez during the 19603, and Myers
wrote a master's thesis on the 'phrase structure' of the language (Myers 1970). She2He also summarized his data in his unpublished ""Notes on Jemez Grammar"" @.d.), in
which he provides concise information about Jemez phonology and morphology. The
notes also contain a vocabulary list.",[20]

[wli-?wh]'arroyo'In terms of classical phonemics, there appears to be a four-way contrast amongstops in Jemez. The presence of [th]especially among the alveolar stops makes the
contrast look as if it is four-way. In other places of articulation, however, there are at
most three stops: for example, among the palatalized and non-palatalized velar stops,there is no aspirated vs. (voiceless) unaspirated contrast. Thus the actual contrast
among stops is three-way: ejectives, voiceless stops, and voiced stops. [th]is often
pronounced as [q.The voiced stops, [b], [d] , [g] ,are often devoiced in the
pronunciation of some speakers.
[ty] is a voiceless unaspirated palatal stop. Some speakers pronounce it as a
slightly affricated [E] before [i] : e.g. [tYisala]([Eisalae]) 'lizard'. Note that [Eh]is
always forcefully articulated, while the variant [E] of [ty]is not. ([P] and [Eh]are
derived from underlying ka/and /khY/,
respectively, in most cases, and 01 comes from
underlying /gY/or /S/.)
The glottal stop r ] can phonetically occur word-initially, intervocalically, and
word-finally before a pause. There are some minimal pairs involving words which
begin with a glottal stop and words which have an initial [fi]: e.g. r g 'blood',[fia'cedar tree' .3
[+] is usually labialized, thus phonetically[v].[fJ only occurs in loan words.","[26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"
"Consonant alternations of this type are not predictable since only some
consonants which derived from certain consonants in Proto-Kiowa-Tanoan are
invoIved. Thus the words which contain these consonants must be so indicated in the
lexicon.412.5.6. Reduplication
Redupiication is used in the formation of the imperfective form of some verbs.
The entire CV syllable of a monosyllabic root or the final syllable (CV) of a
polysyllabic verb root in a compound is copied and attached to the end of the original
root. If the original syllable carries a high tone, the vowel of the reduplicated syllable is
lengthened and carries a F tone, but if it carries an underlying falling tone, the vowel of
the reduplicated syllable is short with a L tone.

consonant alternation between [m] and [p] appears only in detransitivization.","[77, 78]"
"words, and the meanings of some symbols, including an accent mark,are not clear.
Many consonants, especially stops, are incorrectly recorded.
Sarah Cook (1930) contains 54 native botanical terms, but there are many
inaccurate transcriptions.

Jernez personal and place names, written in English spelling, along with their English
glosses.","[22, 23]"
"4.8.2.3. ImperfectiveThe imperfective form is much more regular than the other inflected forms in the
active paradigm. The form is almost possible to predict if we know two things: (a)
which underlying final consonant the verb root contains, and (b) whether the root
occurs with a suffix in the perfective. The imperfective form can be grouped into five
types. Of these, the types (199a) and (199b)are the most common.
(l 99) a.",[221]
"4.3.1. Causative verbsJemez has a small number of lexicalized causative verbs. The language has no
productive syntactic process of causativization. The causative verbs end in [p=] and
were historically derived by compounding [pk*]'make' to other morphemes, such as
active verb roots (21), descriptive nouns (22), and nouns (23). (All the examplesbelow are perfective forms.)'fill' (gY<'be full')
'sharpen' (kai 'be sharp')
'make someone cry' ($11- 'cry')
'make someone laugh' (hf-l- 'laugh')
'anger someone' (khyQ--'angry')
'dry something' (t7kle 'dry one')
'make something wet' (p7Fyk. 'wet one')
'gather, rake' (bi 'whole thing')
'melt' (p3$ 'water')
'write' (tiY 'mark')
The causative verbs are all transitive. Contrast the transitive verbs (24a) - (27a)
with the non-causative (i.e. intransitive) counterparts in (24b)- (27b). The causative
verbs are simple transitives with two arguments, which are encoded as A and P in the
transitive prefixes. The patient (P) in the transitive sentences corresponds to the S of
the intransitive verbs.

before the inverse suffix /-S/: e.g. [p$*S] 'deer-inv' , [kwQ*S]
'teeth-inv'. I treat the /m/and In/ after the noun stems in the inverse as the final consonants of the noun roots in
underlying representation. Furthermore, [i] in the final syllable of the inverse forms is
phonologically derived from the underlying /e/. (See Section 2.5.1 1.) Thus the
underlying forms of the examples in (45) are illustrated in (46) below.

glottalized. (See Section 2.5.3 for the discussion of the Glottalization rule.)
The underlying suffix Le/, whose meaning is not clear, is also found in some
nouns which take [le] or [te] in the inverse form. In this case, the noun roots contain a
final AI or N which only surfaces when l-el is added.

"2.4. Suprasegmentals
2.4.1. Surface tones and their distributionJemez uses pitch differences for lexical and grammatical contrast. At the
surface level, there are four tones: High (H), Low (L), Falling (F), and Mid (M). H is
represented by [' ] above a vowel, F by [""I, M by I'1, and L is unmarked.
Phonetically, H and L are level. F has an onset lower in pitch than that for H, and it is
followed by a quick drop in pitch. F on a short vowel starts at an even lower pitch thanF on a long vowel. M is generally level, but sometimes it has a short downglide. Its
onset is perceptually close to that of F.
The distribution of tones relative to positions within words differs between
native Jemez words and Spanish loanwords. To summarize the differences: in
Spanish loanwords, (a) L tone can occur in an initial syllable in polysyllabic stems; (b)F tone is found in non-initial syllables; (c) a L-tone syllable may be followed by a H-18The word is sometimes pronounced [veymiJ.
19In a small set of verbs, [v] systematically alternates with [p] in inflection: e.g. [gyipe]
'bend/pf, potn, inc', [gyfve]'bendimpf"". In the verb for 'enter', [z] occurs steminitially in some inflectional forms (e.g. potential and imperfective), while [P] is found
in perfective and imperative stems.",[45]

"which distinguish them from the other verb classes is that they contain inflectional
(GlO), whereas verbs of the other classes have l-e/.
suffixes such as 1-01 (G7)and /-i/
The details of the morphological classes are provided in the discussion of each inflected
form, in Sections 4.8.2 and 4.8.3, and a summary appears in Section 4.8.4.
Transitive verbs have eight inflectional stem forms: five active and three
passive forms. Some stems consist of a root plus an inflectional suffix (e.g. perfective
suffix, potential suffix), while others are unsuffixed.u Each stem, whether suffixed or
not, is associated with some prosody (e.g. tonal melody) in the underlying
representation. For example, the potential stem form of G6 verbs has the underlying
e.g. /t?Q.de/
tonal pattern /IF/,e.g. /tP61i?1[tP6?1b]'eat', and that of G8 verbs has /FF/,
[t?@?nj]'beat'. Since the tonal pattern is a property of each inflectional stem, tones are
not specified in the roots in the following discussion of verb inflection.
Active verbs are inflected according to two separate paradigms: the active
paradigm and the detransitive (i.e. passive) paradigm. The active paradigm is for nonderived intransitive verbs and the active form of transitive verbs. The detransitive
paradigm is used for derived intransitive verbs and the passive f o m of transitive verbs.","[214, 215]"

rule. A H tone is normally lowered after the initial root, but in a smdl number of
lexical items, lowering can occur after the first syllable of the initial root. This is
especially common in noun incorporation.

/ta-@k16-H/(&[lsg:3bas]-bear-kill/pf)Considering that in (24b)and (24d) the H tone in the second syllable of the initial root
is lowered when followed by another root beginning with short F, one might set up atone rule to lower a H to L when it occurs between H and M (i.e. an underlying F).
However, HHM (cHH + F) is a common tone sequence in compounds.30cf. [Silkbela] 'corn tortilla' c lSflh/'round' + /bbl6/ 'bread'.",[59]
"In addition to the works cited above, I presented at linguistic conferences a

Spanish reasonably well.
The main differences in speech between the four elders and the younger peopleare phonological. For example, the younger speakers tend to replace Is1 in some
morphemes (e.g. the pronominal prefix ISQ-/)with /h/.4 As for tones, I did not notice
any significant difference between the older and younger generations.
Furthermore, the four elder speakers have a larger Jemez vocabulary than the
younger people, particularly the youngest male. This point was confirmed by my
casual contact with other young Jemez speakers-thosein their 20s and 30s. Forinstance, none of them could count beyond ten in Jernez.",[23]

4.8. l. l. Inflectional categories
All active verbs have at least one set of perfective, imperfective and potentialforms. Transitive verbs have two sets, one for the active voice and one for the passive
voice. In addition to perfective, imperfective, and potential, there are imperative and
incorporative forms. Thus intransitive active verbs have five inflected forms, while
transitive active verbs have eight. This is illustrated in examples (170) and (171).

When a verb in the perfective form occurs as the main verb of a matrix clause, it most
likely means that the action took place sometime in the past, leading to a 'past-tense'
interpretation.","[208, 209, 210, 211]"
