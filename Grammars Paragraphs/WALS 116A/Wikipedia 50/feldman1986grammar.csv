"Yes-no questions also have the same focusing strategies avai lable to them a s do
declarative sentences as described in section 9 . 4 .
I n answering an affirmative quest ion , owo means yes

-In answering affirmative yes-no questions , awtuw no denies the accuracy of the

"The answer to a WH-question will ordinarily consist of the word that wi l l most
suitably replace the interrogative in the question . When the interrogative
bears case marking , the answer too wi l l usually have it , even if the answer
consists of only a single word . It is common , though not quite as common as
in answers to alternative questions , for the particle po to focus the answer .

Particles fall into four semantic subclasses . The a lternative particle , yok r i
perhaps i s discussed further i n section 9 . 1 . 2 on question-forming strategies .
The Negative particle yene i s d i scussed i n section 9 . 2 on Negation strategies
and the Focus particle po i s discussed i n section 9 . 4 . 1 on focus ing strategie s .
Two of the remaining Particles , t a and t a ke , mean here . The rest a l l mean
roughly straightaway . The particles t uwp and ap tend to gravitate to c lause­
initial pos ition and yeka and awan a tend to gravitate to second posi tion .
We can display the distinctions on a feature matrix and i l lustrate the
structure of the classification as a tree .","[42, 43]"
"9 . 1 . 1 While each word stress in a declarative sentence is uttered at approxi­
mately the same pitch , in a yes-no que stion , the last word stre ss in the clause
is appreciably higher in pitch than the others and the pitch of any syllable s
fol lowing that stressed syllable falls markedly as a result . Constituents in a
yes-no que stion have the same freedom of order as in a declarative sentence .

Because of the nature of the equative relation , the subject and predicate of an
Equative clause are interchangeable . Posses sive and Comparative predicates may
precede the ir subj ects with a change in intonation , as in examples ( 20 f ) and

There i s one final predication type that bears some resemblance to some of the
Idiomatic Composite constructions described above ( c f . 5 . 9 ) , on the one hand ,
and to the verble ss body part constructions ( c f . 8 . 3 . 1 ) , on the othe r . All
such predicates denote Cognitive state s .
8 . 7 . 1 Two of the four predicates may be regarded as participating in more or
less straightforward Ascriptive predications that happen to take complements
( see 10 . 2 . 5 ) .

3FS 2SG-O know

nenffin thought occupies the same position in the nenffin l§� construction as do
nouns in other predicates of the same type . Its abi l ity to take - neney he re
provides further evidence for be l ieving ne nffin to be a noun . The adj ective­
deriving suffix on neknek in example ( 2 2 ) suggests that i t may be a noun
denoting ' knowledge ' . But as the next example i l lustrates , neknek can occur8. 7 . 2141
as the predicate without derivation or any verb with which t o partic ipate in a
composite construction , making the gloss ' knowledge ' appear most improbable and
casting doubt upon its part -o f - speech a f f i l iation .

defective verb . A rene takes none of the verb morphology de scribed in Section
4 , but neither does it accept any other affixation except the optional plural
marker - m . It cannot even take - neney , as neknek and ne n�n can , nor can it
modify a noun attributively . I will not speculate further upon its part -of­
speech membership , but simply exempli fy its use .

di stingui shed from declarative clau ses by a change in intonation contour .
Alternative questions are formed by postposing the particle yok r i perhaps to
each alternative . wH-questions are formed by substituting one of the set o f

thoseTo begin with the pronouns , we notice immediately that there are two
demonstrative roots , ( t ) a de and ( t ) opo , each of which codes a category of
proximity , within reach and out of reach respectively . The se are then marked
for plurality with the suffix -m . Non-plural forms further distingui sh female
from non-female referents . The optional t- in the pronouns and the manner
adverb does not appear to correlate with any grammatical category and forms
with and without the t- are in free variation . The eight manner adverb forms
also seem to be in free variation .
We may conveniently compress the demonstrative adverb forms into the fol lowing
constructs .

formal s imi larities that suggest that they ought to be treated together . There
are three basic interrogative adverbs and two pronouns , but the use of the
derivational suffix - kwo allows Awtuw to express a full range of WH- questions

"( 1 ) Fir s t , a s I mentioned above , the subj ect never bears case marking . But the
complementary nouns that co-occur obligatori ly with the idiomatic composite
verbs discussed in 5 . 4 never do so e i the r . Note that in clauses whose sub j ect
is a pronoun , a personal name , or an NP wi th any determiner or modifier , this
problem does not arise because the noun complement of idiomatic complement
constructions i s always a s ingle common noun .
A s imple subs titution test can distinguish the sub j ect in any clause where
there is a doubt as to its identif icat ion . The complementary noun in an
idiomatic composite construction is lexically specified . So if we substitute8788
an appropriate pronoun coreferential with the noun in question , and the clause
remains acceptable , we can be certain that that noun i s the subj ect of the
c laus e , I f such a substitution results in a n unacceptable c l ause , then w e can
identify the noun as a complementary noun .","[93, 94]"

speaker modifies a noun when it is neces sary to attribute more than one
property to that noun .
The answer to this question resides in an explanation of the multiple NPs that

specified as non-Negative , for both Debitive and non-Debitive categories . Thi s

language in its social and sociolinguistic context, Chapter 2 provides an
overview of Awtuw's rich phonological and morphophonological system, Chapter
examines the structure of a few lexical fields of general interest, and Chapter
12 describes some paralinguistic phenomena.
111 . 1 . 3 The aims and methodology of linguistic theory and of linguistic
description are fundamentally different. The aim of theory is to delimit and
explain the functions of language in human society and human cognition. Its
methodology must therefore be to establish a set of explanatory principles that
will generate hypotheses about linguistic functions and the ways that languages
can express them. These hypotheses can then be tested against empirical data
about languages.
The aim of linguistic description is to identify the formal classes, categories ,
and structures of a language on empirical , language-internal evidence. Its
methodology must therefore be to examine and analyse such evidence and to
correlate the formal properties so isolated with their semantic functions.
In other words, it must describe language from the addressee's perspective
decoding forms into meanings, rather than from the speaker's perspective
encoding meanings into forms.
This is not to insist that every identifiable form is necessarily in a one-to­
one correspondence with a single meaning; we often encounter examples of
polysemy or structural ambiguity. But, as a heuristic, we do not expect a
mUltiplicity of forms to correspond to a single semantic category.
1 . 1 . 4 The approach taken in this description is therefore essentially
structuralist. I assume the utility of binary features and relative markedness
in distinguishing categories at all levels of structure. I further assume that
features used in a description should correspond to empirically identifiable
categories. Whenever possible, I have attempted to establish a correspondence
between formal categories and plausible semantic categories .
A feature-based analysis has two advantages . Features often cross-classify
such that a small set of formal/functional properties can distinguish a large
number of categories . It is also possible to make certain kinds of generalis­
ations regarding the properties of marked and unmarked categories.
For example, in the analysis of tense marking in Chapter 4, the feature
NONPRESENT at the same time distinguishes Present forms from Past forms, Future
from Desiderative, and Conditional from Frustrative. It also identifies the
morphologically unmarked Present with the semantically unmarked category of
non-NONPRESENT.
Throughout this description, I have aimed to express significant generalisations
intelligibly. When it seemed to further this aim, have borrowed formalisms
from Generative theory. I do not mean this to imply any credence in the claims
of the theory. The formalisms merely represent a handy and familiar convention
for schematising certain types of generalisations.
When a language is described in accordance with these principles, the hypotheses
generated by theory can be tested against the description. I have attempted
therefore to present an analysis that is empirically-based and relatively
theoretically neutral , and that reflects the structure of the language
faithfully.
I31.2Geography, gene t i c a ffi l i at i on, h i s to ry, a n d ethnogra phy1.2.1Awtuw is the first language of about 400 people living in five villages
between 142°29 ' and 142°3 1 ' East longitude and 3°3 4 ' and 3°3 6 South latitude in
an area of about 30 square kilometres in the southern foothills of the
Torricelli Range in north-western Papua New Guinea (see Map 1 ) . All five
villages are administered as part of the South-west Wapei Census Division of
the Lumi District, Sandaun (West Sepik) Province of Papua New Guinea.
The five Awtuw-speaking villages are located at altitudes ranging from 3 2 0 to
400 metres above sea-level. Rainfall in Kamlakwlape, recorded from May to
December 1980 , ranged from a low of 7 1 . 5mm in June to a high of 2 3 7 . 7mm in
December. Temperatures range from 19 . 4° to 3 2 . 2° Celsius, with an average of
2 2 . 2° at 0600 and 29 . 4° at 1500 daily, with no appreciable seasonal variation.
Table 1.1 lists the five villages with their vernacular names, their names in
Tok Pisin, their populations in 1980 , and the names of the component hamlets.

Forms on this branch distingui sh Nonfactivity as marked in slot - 7 . A lthough
the Nonfactive prefix w- and the Factive prefix d- both make more than one
tense di stinction , it is preferable to identify Nonfactive as the marked form
for the purpose of this analy s i s .
S ince non-Debitive , non-Potential forms make precisely the same distinctions
regardless of their spec i f i cation for Negativity , further d i scussion w i l l be
neutral with respect to Negativity .
Nonfactive and non-Nonfactive forms distinguish tense through the feature
Nonpresent . Nonfactive forms spec i fied Nonpresent bear the Future suffix
and those specif ied non-Nonpresent bear the Desiderative suff ix . Non-Nonfactive
forms specif ied Nonpresent have past tense mark i ng , whi le those speci fied
non-Nonpresent are unmarked for tense .
This feature Conditional dist ingui shes forms with the Conditional suffix in
slot +4 from those that lack it. Condi tional forms are redundantly speci f ied
as Nonfactive . Thus non-Nonfactive forms wil l automatically be specif ied as
non-Conditional , while Nonfactive forms distingui sh Conditional and non­
Conditiona l .
Thi s analys i s conveniently specifies Conditional forms , which occur i n past
contrafactual condition s , as Nonfactive , Nonpresent , and Conditional , and
Frustratives , which depict frustrated de s i re s , as Nonfactive , non-Nonpresen t ,
and Conditional . Note that the only marker from s lot +5 that may co-occur with
the Conditional suf f ix i s the Desiderative suff ix .
I t is now appropriate to d i splay another diagram to c larify the feature
specif ications made thus far and the i r correspondence with verb suffixes .

Potential forms require Nonfactive marking and may bear either the Future
or the Conditional suffix. Redundancy rule 1 yields all possible forms under
this node.

+Nonpresent
Note that Potential forms must also be non-Debitive and non-Negative , but
because all three categories, potential, Debitive, and Negative are expressed
by affixes in the same slot, the redundancy rule need not specify it.
Potential forms may still be specified for Conditionality. Potential
Conditionals take the Conditional suffix and Potential non-Conditionals take
the Future suffix, as was the case with non-Potential forms specified as
Nonfactive and Nonpresent.
-+4.7.6Two additional redundancy rules will specify the mood and tense values
for Debitive forms. The first of these stipulates that Negative Debitives will
also be Nonfactive and Nonpresent, and so have Future marking, and
non-Negative Debitives will be neither.

This rule stipulates that any form specified as Perfect will also be
non-Imperfective regardless of the specifications for the other three features
and that non-Perfect forms that
also non-Debitive, non-Nonfactive, and
non-Nonpresent must be specified are
as
Imperfective. In other words , forms with
any Debitive or tense marking may bear
either Perfect or Imperfective marking,
or be unmarked for aspect, while non-Debitive
forms unmarked for tense must
bear either the Perfect or the Imperfective suffix.","[68, 69, 70]"

"CHAPTER 1I NTRODUCT I O N
1. 1PrefaceThe data upon which I base the description presented here was collected in the
course of a field trip of 15 months' duration' (November 1979 February 1 9 8 1 )
in the village of Kamnum, the largest of the five Awtuw-speaking villages .
Insofar as possible I have gleaned examples from a small corpus of narrative
text. But I have also used elicited examples to illustrate points where
necessary.
The content and structure of this description rest on a number of assumptions
which I will attempt to make explicit.
-1 . 1 . 1 Language is a singularly prominent facet of culture in that it serves as
the main repository and channel of communication of culture. But there are
areas of linguistic structure that may in most cultures be described
conveniently and without significant distortion as discrete from other aspects
of culture.
within the domain that is nuclear to language, there are a number of structural
components that mediate between meanings to be conveyed and the acoustic code
through which they are transmitted. These components are the proper subject of
linguistic description.
1 . 1 . 2 The physical properties of the acoustic code are marginal to linguistic
description. Similarly, the nature of the relations between expressible
meanings and cognitive processes on the one hand and external reality on the
other, are marginal to the description of linguistic structure.
within this periphery are three main structural components. The phonological
component mediates between meaningful forms and the acoustic code through which
they are transmitted. The lexical component mediates between lexical forms and
expressible meanings. And the grammatical component organises the composition
and combination of lexical forms , mediating, as it were , between the other two
components .
Viewed in this way, the grammatical component is central to linguistic structure.
I intend here to present a comprehensive, even if not exhaustive , description
of the morphology, syntax, and morphosyntax of Awtuw. Because Awtuw is a
previously undescribed language, I include information on aspects of the
language peripheral to my main concerns. Specifically, Chapter 1 places the1Feldman, H. A grammar of Awtuw.

Wurm ( 1 9 7 7 a ) has drawn attention to a remarkable consistency among the diverse
languages of New Guinea in the forms of certain personal pronouns . Examining
the s ingular forms in all three persons and the first and second person plural s ,
h e finds that most of the pronouns marking these categories throughout New
Guinea fall into one of three basic sets and that a given language wi l l often
select most of its pronouns from the same set or in a predictable way from two
or a l l three set s . Because the pronominal forms in a given set crop up over a
geographically large area and in no way restrict themselves to s ingle genetic
groupings , Wurm concludes that personal pronouns are , contrary to popular
opinion , commonly borrowed from language to language .
Awtuw ' s personal pronouns are quite consi stent in their set membership . The
second person plural form bears no resemblance to the pronouns in any of the
sets Wurm has establ i shed . But the other four categories a l l display Set I
feature s .
One of the postulated Set I forms for third person singular i s / te / , which
resembles the corresponding female form in Awtuw quite c losely . There i s a l so
a predictable consonant alternation , character istic of Set I pronouns signal l ing
the gender distinction in the third person s ingular . A property of second
person s i ngular forms in Set l aX appears to end in a coronal consonant and
begin with a /y/ , as does the Awtuw form /ye n / . S imilar l y , Set I first person
forms typica lly contain an / n / , while Set X forms add to this a /wV - / in the
s ingular , and an /-m/ in the plura l , yie lding the Awtuw forms /wa n / and / nom/ .
Personal pronouns have a somewhat different set of morphological properties
from nouns , demonstratives , and interrogatives . With regard to the suff ixes
they may accept , nouns marked for number resemble personal pronouns . In other
respects , however , personal pronouns are unique .
First of a l l , only personal pronouns may bear the Possessive suffix -ke ,
described in 6 . 3 . Second , the Obj ect suffix on personal pronouns has the
canonical form -e , subj ect to vowe l harmony ( cf . 2 . 2 . 1 0 ) , and does not exhibit
the sex gender agreement characteristic of the corresponding suffix on other
substantive lexemes . And third , personal pronouns may never bear the Locative/
Direction suffix -e/ke , described in 6 . 5 .

the data it is based upon belong to the Awtuw speaking people of Kamlakwlape,
Wutlakwlape , Wiyuplape , Tupumlape, and Kalaktuwlape .
I am most deeply indebted to the people of Meleylape , who allowed me to live in
their hamlet for fifteen months, who helped me in many ways, and who patiently
taught me their language . Among those who were most forthcoming were Yowmen,
Takiy, Poliw, Altiy, Awkay, Awtiy, Eykiy, Kampo, Keriy, Mimpel , Momoy, Naytow,
Osiy, Ruwmay, Wawpey, Yinow, Napeyre, Nimpiy. I am particularly grateful to
Kewmaey, Yawur, Yakop, and Napeyre, who allowed me to tape their narratives and
to Peyaw, Mimpel, and Ruwmay, who dictated stories to me . There is no way that
I can ever repay my debt to Yawur and Yakop, who helped me to transcribe texts
and provided virtually all of the elicited material I have used.
I am also grateful to the Institute of Papua New Guinea Studies, the Department
of Language at the University of Papua New Guinea, the Sandaun Provincial
Government, the Lumi District Office, and Kewmaey, Councillor for the Awtuw­
speaking area, for their permission to study Awtuw.
A large number of people deserve my thanks for the accommodation they so
graciously provided. Wietze Baron accommodated me at Ukarumpa. Paul of the
Lumi Police Detachment, Ian Bagley and other staff at Lumi High School , Father
Terry and others at St Mary' s Catholic Mission, and Kewmaey allowed me to stay
in their houses in Lumi . And Brian McClintock put me up in Port Moresby.
Leo Yimiten and Lumi District Office Staff helped me in a variety of ways and
made the 1980 census data available to me .
Val Lyon of the Department of Geography, Faculty of Arts at the Australian
National University was kind enough to draw the map.
Ger Reesink, Wietze Baron, Ken McElhanon, Les Bruce, and Dave Scorza of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics (PNG Branch) discussed my proposed fieldwork
with me and provided me with access to some unpublished material in their
library.
Don Laycock, Cecil Brown, Bill Mitchell , and Keith Thomas corresponded with me
and encouraged me while I was in the field.
I would also like to thank Avery Andrews , Cliff Goddard, Ian Green, Walter
Seiler, Tim Shopen and David Wilkins for discussing my work with me, and Cliff
and David in particular for their valuable comments on draft chapters .
The Australian National University provided me with a generous scholarship
which made it possible to undertake this project at all .
Finally, my gratitude to Tanya and Adam McConvell for their support and
encouragement is unbounded.

among the affixes that may appear in the Awtuw verb complex . A simple statement
of positional restrict ions can account for some o f these . A verb may not be
spec ified , for example , as both Negative and Potential because once the
Negative prefix has occupied s lot -8 , the Potential prefix cannot do so , and
vice versa .
A number of co-occurrence restrictions apply to affixes that f i l l different
s lot s . The purpose of this section is to submit the relevant morphemes to an
analysis that assign s a set of feature speci fications to each and stipulates
the i r co-occurrence poss ibi lities in terms of a set of redundancy rules .
We w i l l be primarily concerned with the categories of tense , aspect , and mood ,
represented in verbal affixes in s lots - 8 , -7 , -2 , +2 , +4 , and +5 . There w i l l
also b e reason t o touch o n the category o f person , which i s represented i n
Awtuw onl y as a portmanteau o f the Debitive modal ity prefixes , and number .
S ince no co-occurrence restrictions apply to the other categories marked by verb
morphology , it w i l l be unnecessary to analyse them in thi s way .
Three features dist ingu i sh the categor ies of modal ity marked in s lot - 8 . The
feature Debitive distinguishes forms marked with p a - , kan - , wa n - , a p - , and n i 1 from those marked with n a - , k a - , or ¢ . Potential distinguishe s those marked
with n a - from tho se marked with k a - or ¢ . Negative distinguishes those marked
with ka- from unmarked forms on the one hand , and those marked with pa - , kan - ,
and wa n - from those marked with a p - and n i l - on the other .
The feature Nonfactive distinguishes forms marked with w- in s lot -7 from
those that do not bear the Nonfactive pre fix . As I mentioned in the discussion
above , Factive and Nonfactive marking is conditioned by tense . This makes the
non-Factive feature useful in the spec i f ication of the tense suffixes as wel l
as the Factive and Nonfactive prefixes . Specifical ly , the feature
distinguishes Future and Desiderative forms from Past and unmarked forms .
The purpose of this analysis is to describe co-occurrence restrictions on overt
morphemes . The features therefore corre spond directly with morphological
categor ies . Ideal ly , a feature mediates between a morphologically marked
category and a corresponding semantic category . S ince the morphological
category of Nonfactivi ty i n Awtuw i s semantically redundant , specifications
of forms for thi s feature may at times seem arbitrary .
The feature Nonpresent distinguishes Past and Future forms , which are overtly
marked and have Nonpresent time reference from Desiderative forms and forms
unmarked for tense , which have present time reference .
Fina l l y , the features Conditional , Perfect , Imperfective , Second Person , Third
Person , P lural , and Dual are morphologically and semantically transparent .
Since the categories o f aspect , person , and number i n Awtuw a l l make three-way
d i st inction s , a pair of features is required for each .","[65, 66, 67]"

( 3 ) Prohibitives with the pre f ix a p-/�p- are the negative counterpart of
imperative s and , l ike imperatives , always have second-person subj ects . Clauses
with Prohibitive verbs share most of the prope rties of other debitive clauses ,
but are even more likely to be verb f inal .

( 5 ) Negative Debitives have the pref ix n i 1 - and generally expre ss
impossibility . They are not therefore a direct opposite of a debitive , that
i s , they do not mean ' unnece ssary ' . Rather , if we vi sualise a scale of
pos s ib i l ity with nece ssity at one pole and impossibil ity at the other , the
negative debitive form expresses the pol a r oppos ite of the debitive , as

2. 1 . 1Phonol ogy
The a n a l ys i s o f d i phtho n g sThe nucleus of a syllable i n Awtuw frequently consists phonetically of a vowe l
and an of fgl ide . The balance of the phonological analysis rests crucially
upon whether such sequences are analysed as unitary phonemes , as sequences of
two vowels , or as vowels fol lowed by consonantal g l ides . I will therefore open
by presenting two arguments that motivate the vc analysi s .
1 . Awtuw ' s Locative/Directional suffix h a s two allomorphs , - e and - ke , whose
allomorphy is straightforward and natural to describe for a vc analysis , but
complex and artificial under a unitary phonemic or a vv analysis. The -ke
allomorph occurs after vowels , and the -e al lomorph after consonants .
( 1)(a)aewre - ke
house-L(b)y i 1- e

ho le-L(d)e
tepy i wside of house-LThe a llomorphy of the Location/Direction suffix treats the offglides in ( lc-d )
l ike the consonant in ( lb) rather than the vowe l in ( la ) . A V or a VV analysis
would require the addition of a very unnatural morphophonemic rule to delete
the /k/ from the suf fix following a phonetic diphthong .
2 . Furthermore , although any vowel may be the first in a diphthong , a l l
d iphthongs end i n e i ther /w/ or /y/ . The more general descriptive statement
that a diphthong may begin with any vowel and end in any semivowe l is preferable1011
to the idiosyncratic statement that only high vowels function a s syl labic coda .
The VV and unitary vowel analyses would also require a rule to transform high
vowe ls into glides between two other vowels; a rule that the VC analysis
obviates entirely . No phenomena have come to my attention that a unitary
phoneme or VV analys is explains but cause dif ficulties for the VC analys is .","[16, 17]"

The rules are ordered and must apply sequentially . This i s particularly
important in the case of the vowel harmony ru les that affect the qual ity of the
Imperfective and Past suffixes ( 2 . 2 . 7 and 2 . 2 . 1 0) . Although nearly identical
in form, one must apply before , and the other after , the e l i sion rule ( 2 . 2 . 9 ) .
with the exception of the vowel gradation rule ( 2 . 2 . 2 0 ) , I have used the
traditional forma l i sms of Generative Phonology to capture the rules conc i sely .
But as I mentioned in Sect ion 1 . 1 . 4 , I do not mean to imply any credence in the
claims of the theory . The formalism mere ly represents a convention to
schematise morphophonological rule s .
Among the formal i sms I have adopted is the labe lled angle bracket notation
(Chomsky and Halle 1 968 : 394-395) . This convention , suggested to me by Avery
Andrews , permits parts of the environment for a rule to be keyed to the
presence or absence of a feature . The benefit of this forma l i sm is that a
single process with a complex environment can be represented as a single ru le ,
in conformity with the intuitive j udgement that the process is unitary in spite
of the complexity of its environment .
Features enclosed in label l ed angle brackets are interpreted as relevant parts
of the environment if the label is [+J, and are ignored when the label is [-J.
Greek letter values are multiplied by any operator on them . Thus , an angle
bracket labe l led [aJ has the same value as some f eature specified [aJ. But an
angle bracket label led [-aJ has the oppos i te value from the f eature spec ified
as [aJ. In example ( 2a ) , the feature F2 is a re levant part of the environment
when Fl is spec ified as [ + J , and irre levant when Fl is speci f ied as [-J. In
example ( 2b) , F2 is relevant when Fl is [-J, and irrelevant when Fl is [+J .
(2)(a)[aFIJ
[ +F2 J><ex(b)[aFIJ
[ +F2 J><-exThus , the environment in ( 2a) wi l l be read as either [ -FI J , or [ +F l , +F 2 J , and
( 2b) will be read as e ither [ +FI J , or [ -Fl , +F2 J .
I present each rule in a separate subsection , so references to , e . g . Rule 3 ,
refer to the rule presented i n subsection 2 . 2 . 3 . Note that this type of
analysis produces intermediate forms that are neither phonemic nor phonetic
( c f . Chomsky and Halle 1968 : 65 ) . I enclose all non-phonemic forms in square
brackets ([ . . . J) .","[22, 23]"

least 3 0 morphemes , li sted below , that can fill it . Second , as many as three
of the e l i gible morphemes can co-occur in the same verb complex . I have chosen
to place the entire class o f morphemes in the same s lot , rather than three
separate slot s , because any of the e ligible morphemes would be able to occupy
any of the s lot s , as long as no s ingle morpheme occurs more than once . And
final l y , seven of the morphemes are identical or nearly identical in form to a
verb root that occurs independently. I t is for thi s reason that I have
designated the slot a Compound slot. Another factor that has contributed to
this deci sion is the semantic diversity that the morpheme s in this class
d i splay. They range from the Benefactive suffix -kow which increases the
valence of the verb it i s attached to , through the aspectual-l ike I nchoative
suffix - tffiwa , to such apparently lexical and adverbial meanings as - a t a in
order to detain someone .
Every member of this class of morphemes is of a phonological shape plausible
for a verb root , i . e . they end in a consonant or /a/ , and it i s l ike ly that
this construction has ari sen diachronically from a very tightly-bound verb
serialisation . As the seriali sation crystall ised into suffixation , some o f the
verbs which could participate in the seriali sation have ceased to occur as
independent verb s , and a few have not yet done so .
The suffixes that can f i l l this slot may conveniently be divided into semantic
c lasses wh ich I label Grammatical , ' pretend ' Aux i l iary , Aspectual , Quantitative ,
Adverbia l , Consecutive , and Obstructive .",[81]

stem which enters into the verb complex as if it were a single root . While any
verb may be the first in such a compound , the second and subsequent roots are
se lected from a clo sed set of about 30 member s . About a third of the members
of this set may themselves function as independent verb roots in meanings
reasonably closely re lated to the meanings they express in a compound . The
balance bear no phono logical resemblance to any independent verb root , although
they al l have a phonologica l shape that would be plausible for one .
The morphemes that may occur as the second and subsequent components of such a
compound range in meaning from �2� give , which marks verbs with a benefactive
argument , through aspectual meanings l ike ! ��� begin and �2 � � � comp le te ly ,
auxi l iary- like meanings l ike (�� � ) e � try , and adverbial meanings l ike � �� !�

There is no apparent correlation between the independence of the morpheme and
the independence of its meaning from that of the matrix verb root . Thus , kow
the bene factive marker , which has the most clearly ' grammatical ' meaning of the49
morphemes in this set , is among the commonest verbs in the language used

verb . In fact , the form that I cite as the root , � ���y is probably a
crystalised imperfective stem formed from a root � and the imperfective
circumfix - k - -ey .
If this conj ecture is correct , then the initial vowe l would
have ari sen from an epenthetic vowel regu larly inserted between the factive
prefix d- and the prefix component of the imperfective circumf ix - k - and a
regular w-metathesis rule would have reversed the order of the - k - and the -w- .
The future form , w-owkey - re , which occurs only rare l y , demonstrates that the
form is indeed crystalised because the regular future imperfective of a root �
would have to be * ka -w-ey- re . There wou ld be no factive prefix , the non-factive
prefix w- would be deleted before the - k - , and there would be no epenthetic
vowel before the -k- to accept stress and condition w-metathesi s . The past
tense form , d - awkey- e , i s much more common . The root appears very often in the
Debitive wan-owkey . A l l three of these are formal ly regular for a root �� �� y .
But the root occurs most frequently in a defective imperfective form unmarked
for tense , d - awkey , sometimes with the Absentive prefix wa- , yielding
da-w- awkey .
Like � � ��y , l �lY stay , live , be a live resembles an imperfective stem .
But here if we were to assign the - k - and the - i y to the imperfective circumfix,
the verb would most likely have to be derived from a root with the canonical
form 0, and it i s difficult to see how a O- root could condition the - i y
allomorph of the imperfective suffix . I t seems more probable that l � l Y derives
from the imperfective of l� sit .","[89, 90, 91]"

he 's sitting down when I 've goneAs I mentioned in section 4 . 12 , Awtuw ' s abi lity to code a variety of a spectual
and adverbial categories in compounding roots and elsewhere in the verb comp lex
compensate s for its lack of conj unctions . The se categor ies , along with regular
a spe ct marking and the adverbial prefixes in slots -5 and -4 , make it pos s ible
to form a wide variety of temporal c lause s .
An embedded clause with imperfective marking is typically interpreted as a
whi le-c lause . The adverbial pre f i x t aw- sti l l can reinforce this
interpretation .

marked for future in both the protasis and the apodosis , as in ( 6 1 ) , and
contrafactual conditionals have verbs marked as conditional in both c lauses , a s
in ( 6 0 ) and ( 6 2 ) . In e i ther case , there i s a strict constraint that the two
inte rdependent clause s bear the same marking for tense and modality, although
each verb selects aspect , direction , and negative marking independently .
Moreove r , each verb carries an independent set of arguments and adj uncts .

in the preceding sections , Awtuw can concatenate fully independent c lauses .
One such clause is never embedded in the othe r , nor may either clause bear case
marking . Each clause is always entirely acceptable on its own .
Unl ike the previously described strategies , where the tense of the verb in one
c lause was dependent upon the tense of the other - either determined by the
construction , or re lative to the time of the matrix verb , the tense of each
c lause in co-ordinate constructions is independent of the other . The tense of
every verb has absolute time reference .
Furthermore , the clauses in these constructions are independent with respect to
i l l ocutionary force . One c lause may be in a debitive or potential modal i ty ,
or be a question , while the other i s not .
