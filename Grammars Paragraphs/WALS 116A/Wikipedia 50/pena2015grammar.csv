Two /oating clitics only occur in interrogative clauses when an interrogative
word is present: =ki ‘Rhetorical question’141 and =pa ‘Question marker’. Both =ki and
=pa can occur either in the interrogative word, as in (49) and (51); or in some other
constituent of the clause, as in (50), (52). The common element is that the interrogative141. This =ki also frequently occurs attached to ia ‘who’ in contexts where there is no rhetorical

function is not clearly present in Wampis.",[402]
"286Figure 6.13. Prosodic contour of ‘this story is called ""Auhu""’6.9.2. Non-declarative intonational contour
Interrogative utterances do not show a ""nal rising in pitch, but the question
word receives the highest level of pitch. Imperative utterances may have a ""nal rising
pitch if the tone of the imperative su#x -tá surfaces; i.e. if there is no other lexical tone
in the verbal root. Otherwise, a command utterance does not necesarily end with a high
287contour pitch. A similar pattern is shown in hortatory utterances with the su#x -mí.
An example of an interrogative intonation contour is given with a question [i ́i

the pronoun íi ‘1pl’ (which is pragmatically focused in this sentence) and then by the

The other use of =api in Wampis is in tag questions. In that function =api too
attaches to a verb or nominal element and turns a declarative proposition into a
question. Not surprisingly, most examples of =api in tag questions come from
conversations, as in the following example.

18.10. Mirative
The category of Mirativity is related to the expectation of knowledge: “the term
mirativity refers to the linguistic marking of an utterance which is new or unexpected to
the speaker” (DeLancey 2001b: 370), information that is thus new and not yet part of
the “speaker’s integrated picture of the world” (DeLancey 1997: 49). The mirative in
Wampis is done with the morpheme =hama. This morpheme can occur su#xed or
detached from the verb,261 forming its own prosodic word, thus I treated as a clitic-like261. In some cases, while transcribing, speakers would correct me if I did not write hama as a
separate word.","[826, 827]"

translated as <¿cómo podemos hacer?> ‘how can we do [it]?’. There even seems to be
some lexical content to the interrogative word. This and the previous examples suggest
that it is possible to consider some question words as interrogative verbs, as they are
able to receive some categories associated with verbs.
In fact, some examples suggest that at least uruka could be treated as a question
verb. In (68), the interrogative word uruka receives the future marker -ta and the 1PL
marker -hi (which is taken from the set that occurs only with ""nite declarative verbs),
just like “normal” lexical verbs in declarative mood can. Notice also that the translation
suggests some lexical meaning to the interrogative word, as there is no elided verb “do”
in the Wampis structure.

similar examples evidence that the morphosyntactic possibilities of interrogative words
in Wampis are unusually complex. Future research with additional data may shed more
light on the complex properties of Wampis interrogatives.","[411, 412, 413]"
"The interrogative itura occurs mostly with the subordinator -sa, as in (61).

On the other hand, uru-based interrogative words occur with any of the four
su#xes presented in Table 8.9. The meaning of uruka ‘how’ apparently changes
according to the marker it receives: with -tasa it means ‘what for’; with -sa and -ku, it
most frequently means ‘how’ but sometimes speakers interpret it as ‘why’; with -matai ̃,
it means ‘why’.
The simultaneous -ku in question words is used when a related action in the
discourse is seen as ongoing. In (62), uruka ‘how’ occurs with the simultaneous -ku
(notice in this case the 2PL person marking on the question word). The question in the
example is asked with a reason sense of ‘why is this happening to you?’ (a free
368translation equivalent would be: ‘What’s up with you?’). Notice that the imperfective
marker -a occurs with the simultaneous -ku (this happens regularly in subordinate verbs
(§19.6).

The reason I analyze the form uruka as ‘how+IPFV’ is that the vowel /a/ of uruka
does not undergo elision in spite of being in a place to be deleted (Wampis deletes the
third vowel from the left, as explained in Chapter VI). So, my analysis is that the
imperfective fuses with the last vowel /a/ of uruka, blocking vowel elision (this is a
regular pattern in Wampis, as explained in §5.3.5). Compare with the surface form of
uruka in (64), where the vowel /a/ is deleted. So, morphologically, it appears as if the
interrogative word is treated like a verbal stem. The facts that uruka can take subject
markers, subordinators and apparently imperfective aspect makes them “clausal” (or
verbal) in behavior.","[408, 409]"

urutima‘How many’, ‘Howuruti+*-ma (?)Amountmuch’As can be seen, some question words (especially the ones derived with the roots
uru) are historically complex. Words with the roots uru occur with the formatives -ka (in355‘how’), -ti (in ‘when’) and -ma (in ‘how many’); however, these su#xal formatives are
already fossilized and their meanings are not easily identi""able. The formative *-ka is
very likely a fossilized version of the interrogative clitic =ka that is otherwise
productive in the Wampis language (see §18.8). Based on semantics and phonetic
similarity, the formative *-ti that occurs with uru to form the time question word ‘when’
could be related to the derivational su#x -tin ‘time’ (which can be shortened to -ti ́ (see
example (90) later in this chapter), that is used to derive adverbials that express ideas
of date and season (see §8.6.2.1). I have found no evidence of a possible source for the
formative *-ma. In addition, uruka ‘how’ has a variant uruku that seems to be an old
nominalized form bearing Set II nominalizer -u ‘Subject nominalizer’ (§15.4.5). This
form uruku, in the data, only occurs when the interrogative word bears the locative
=numa (see example (42)), the inferential =t͡su or in combination with a cliticized
copula (see (71), down below); intriguingly, these three elements cliticize to nouns (or
noun phrases).139
The next examples illustrate the use of interrogative words in action:139. In only one example in the data uruku occurs with the past habitual =huk, which occurs
with verbs.","[395, 396]"
"• Syntactically, interrogative words remain “in situ” depending on the gramamtical role
they ful""ll and are rarely moved to the front of the clause. That question words occur

discussed in order to better understand the behavior of the copula a, copula clitics and
the existential. An analysis of their functions follows afterward.
17.5.2. Morphosyntactic distinctions
17.5.2.1. The expression of TAM categories
With regard to TAM categories, the following principles distinguish the copula a,
the copula clitics and the existential a in Wampis (they are explained in the subsequent
discussion, below):• The copula a is used in non-present declarative moods (including past and future
739tense references), tag questions and subordinated constructions.","[778, 779, 780]"

The clitic =ka also is used for contrastive focus. In the next example, the
speaker contrast how diabetes is said in Spanish (17.a) and in Wampis (17.b).

The focus =ka is also used to express assertion. In the next example, a person
778dreams that he is going to transform into a jaguar, but no one believes him. The
character exclaims:
(18) wi ́kʲa kanáruithʲɛɛ
ui=kakana-ra-u=ita-ha-i1SG=FOCdream.PFV-DISTR-NMLZ=COP-1SG.SBJ-DECL‘I did dream (about that)’.
In the next example, the narrator re-asserts a new information just provided.
First he introduces the name of the character (“Inchis”) and then he re-asserts this new
information:

Another use of =ka is in parenthetical clauses. Parenthetical clauses are clauses
that are not grammatically required; rather, they add information usually used to
comment, qualify, clarify, or provide an afterthought to an statement. The following are
the ""nal lines of a text in which one of my Wampis teacher was teaching me how some779plants are used to cure wounds. After he ""nishes (“those are [the plants that we use for
healing]”) he adds an afterthought comment which is marked with =ka:

doctor.’
Finally, I have found that =ka is used in cleft-like constructions, marking a
relative clause in focus function (in this case, the structure in brackets [ ] is relativized
by the non-visible demonstrative nu):
́ ɛiti
(21) wi ́kʲa nekáati túsan wakɨ ́rah núka jũw

NON.VIS=FOChũ=aiti
PROX=COP.3+DECL‘What I want you to know is this.” (Lit.: ‘[What I want, saying: ‘let him know’], is this.’
The focus marker =ka and the conditional -ka (§19.11) are homophonous and
likely related (cf. Overall (2007: 507) for an initial suggestion of this claim in Awajun,
and Haiman (1978) for a cross-linguistic study on the development of conditionals). I
have found some examples of what appears to be the focus =ka being used as a
conditional. This is based on the fact that the conditional is only used in subordinate
780verbs (cf. §19.11), but in the example below =ka occurs on pɨnkɨra ‘good’’, which is an
adjective.

18.5. Additive =ʃa
The additive =ʃa has a variety of functions. Its basic function is to serve to mark
additive focus, i.e. =ʃa expresses “that the predication holds for at least one alternative
of the expression in focus” ((Krifka 1998: 11)).
A simple additive focus function is illustrated in the following example.
(23) ɲawáã arútmaʃa áhaku ti ́maji
jaguar arutama=ʃaa=hak-utimajijaguar power.vision=ADDexist=PT.HAB-NMLZNARR‘There used to be also Arutam jaguar.’
The additive =ʃa is also used to mark the topic of a question:
(24) nihʲamãń t͡ʃiʃa áwak
nihamãt͡ʃi=ʃaa-ua-kamanioc.beer=ADDexist-3.SBJ-Q‘Is there manioc beer?’
The additive =ʃa has also other extended uses when it is used with the781restrictive =kɨ (cf. §18.3).
18.6. Speculative =ʃa
The speculative =ʃa indicates that the speaker judges that the proposition
expressed by his or her utterance is possibly true, but there is a possibility that it is not.
This meaning is usually translated as “may be” (tal vez) by Wampis speakers.

18.7. Inferential =t͡su
The clitic =t͡su marks inference or supposition. It attaches mostly to nominals
but can also be received by verbal elements.
The following example comes from a ‘Pear ""lm’ story (see Chafe (1980)). In this
part, some children take a basket full of pears that a man has been collected. When the
man climbs down the tree, he sees the children walking away and notices that one of
his baskets is missing. From the evidence at hand, he infers that it has been the children
who took the basket:
(26) atákʃa út͡ʃi wakɨ ́tki miníɲan íis nitʲát͡suk kasámturkaruiti túsa tú ɨnɨ ́ntɛimʲar iɲɛ́isouwɛiti

‘Again, seeing that the children were walking, saying “They [the children] must have
robbed me”.’
The clitic =t͡su can occur with a verbal su#x -tai that also marks inference
§14.4.5. The di$erence between =t͡su and -tai is not well understood but there is
apparently no semantic change in the inferential meaning added by these morphemes.
In terms of their distribution, when -tai occurs on the verb, =t͡su can occur but only
attached on a nominal constituent. The next example illustrates this. In the passage seen
in the example, a group of women is making tuim /tuimpi/, a type of food that was
served in some special occasions. In this case, the Wampis have just defeated a group of
Awajun, and the warriors, following a ritual of celebration, were to eat tuim for the
occasion. However, one of the women is half-Awajun and half-Wampis. The other
Wampis women and the pamuk (a type of ceremonial leader) notice that the halfAwajun woman’s tuim smells of blood.

fod to smell bad)”.
The inferential =t͡su might be related to the homophonous negative imperfective
verbal su#x -t͡su (cf. §13.4).
18.8. Interrogative =ka
The interrogative is marked with the question marker =ka, as in (28).
(28) ájatɨk awákɨamɨk
aiatɨkɨ auakɨ-a-mɨ=ka
onlyreturn-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q‘Do you only rewind it [i.e. the cassette]?’
Though =ka occurs mostly on nouns and verbs, it actually can be received by
784most parts of speech: pronouns, adjectives and adverbs. The following is an example in
which the interrogative =ka attaches to a noun.
(29) ámɨ wari ́ arútmak wɛi ́nkʲatam
amɨ wariarutama=kawaina-ka-ta-mɨ2SGpower.vision=Qsee-INTENS-IMM.FUT-2SG.SBJwhat‘So you, which Arutam are you going to see?’
An important morphological property of the question clitic marker is that it
occurs before the copula clitics:
(30) pɨ ́ŋkɨrkɛita
pɨnkɨra=ka=ita
good=Q=COP.3
‘Is it good?
The question marker is historically related to the focus marker =ka (cf. §18.4).
However, unlike the focus marker, which never undergoes apocope, the question
marker does undergo apocope, as in (29) above.
18.9. Sudden realization =api and Tag question =api
The clitic =api is primarily used when someone realizes that something has not
gone as expected, with an outcome usually regarded as negative. Unlike the mirative,
the event depicted by =api is typically directly associated to a volitive action done by
the speaker and thus the event is not as strongly counter-expected as with the mirative.
In the next example, a woman who is a big-eater eats up all the food without saving785some for her husband. So, while the realization that there is no more food is sudden,
this is not totally unexpected information (as she herself has been eating it all up):
(31) ɛi ́ʃrunka ampi ́rat͡ʃhapi
aiʃi-ru=na=kaampi-ra-t͡ʃa-ha=apihusband-1SG=acc=FOCsave.food-DISTR-NEG-1SG.SBJ=sud.realz‘Oops, I didn’t save food for my husband!’
And in the following example, the speaker recounts how the villagers agreed in a
community assembly to ask shamans from other communities for help, after they realize
that the children in their village were behaving strangely due to witchcraft.260 She uses
a construction with =api to talk about this situation:
(32)i ́ikʲa húniakur puhut͡ʃuapitji wari ́n áa hui ̃ʃa wari ́n hátak áa

wari ̃ahui ̃=ʃawari ̃hata=kaawhatexisthere=SPECwhatsickness=Qexist‘We do not live like that, what is there here, which sickness is there?’
In terms of the distribution of =api, it is interesting to notice that in the above
example =api is received by a nominalized form, and in turn =api is followed by a
copula clitic. So it seems that =api behaves distributionally in a similar fashion as the
question marker =ka, which can be received by other non-verbal elements but works at260. Notice, again, that this is—culturally—not totally unexpected information, as sickness and
psychological problems are usually attributed to witchcraft in the Wampis worldview.","[817, 818, 819, 820, 821, 822, 823, 824, 825, 826]"

basic morphosyntactic properties that serve to group interrogative words together are:• The presence of interrogative words mark the clause as a question. Interrogative
words specify the information that is being requested.","[398, 399]"
"• Interrogatives words mark the clause as a question
The presence of an interrogative word imparts content interrogative mood to the359clause where it occurs. This can be seen in the fact that no other mood su#xes occur on
the verb. Compare (43) with (44):

In (43), the declarative mood is marked with -i on the verb. On the other hand,
the morphological position for mood (which is the last position in the verb piece) in
(44) is not phonologically ""lled. In other words, interrogative mood is marked by the
presence of the interrogative word and the absence of other mood su#xes on the verb.","[399, 400]"

The restrictive =kɨ (cf. §18.3) and the su#x -ki(ni) ‘do action while moving’ (cf.
§13.3.2.6) undergo processes of vowel harmony. Vowel harmony involves the vowels
/i/ and /ɨ/. A particular pattern in Wampis (as will be seen from the discussion in
§5.5.1 and §5.5.2) is that, regardless of order, the high front vowel /i/ dominates over
the high central vowel /ɨ/ for purposes of vowel harmony. It is interesting that vowel
harmony between /i/ and /ɨ/ somehow “re/ects” the phonotactic restriction that
prohibits clusters /iɨ/ or /ɨi/ (§4.3.2).
5.5.1. Restrictive =kɨ
The vowel of the restrictive =kɨ always undergoes vowel harmony with a last
high front vowel /i/ of the stem. In the case of =kɨ, it is the vowel of the clitic which
changes: ɨ → i. Compare the realizations of =kɨ (39) as opposed to (40).

"369Example (64) illustrates the occurrence of uruka with the non-temporal
subordinator -sa (notice in this example there is no person marking on the interrogative
word because of the presence of the copula, which takes the person marking).

‘We go on observing, thinking “how is it?”’ (Lit.: ‘. . . saying: how is it?’)With the switch-reference -matai ̃, the interrogative word uruka acquires the
meaning of ‘why’. The su#x -matai ̃ is a 1SG/3 di$erent-subject switch-reference marker
that is used everywhere else in sequential subordinate clauses (§19.6.2). The DS
function can be seen in examples like (65), where the subjects of the two clauses are
di$erent:

see-INTENS-REC.PT-2SG.SBJ‘Why are there no eggs, [if] you have seen [that there were].’
However, it appears that for many speakers -matai ̃ is being reanalyzed as an
integral part of uruka, to the point where the word urukamatai ̃ has come to be370considered an unanalyzable word meaning ‘why’.145 Thus, it is not unusual to hear
expressions like the one in (66), where matai ̃ is not marking 1SG/3 person or di$erent
subject.146

Undoubtedly, the oddities of grammaticalization have led to di$erent kinds of
morphosyntantic behavior in interrogatives. As we have seen, in some cases, it appears
that some complex expressions are being grammaticalized and behave already as
synchronically unanalyzable question words.
As a ""nal point, notice that uruka and itura can replace not only NPs but also
predicates. When replacing predicates, these question words take all the morphological
markers of the replaced verb.","[409, 410, 411]"

"14.2.3. Future tense
There are two morphological future tenses in Wampis: -ta ‘immediate future’ and
-tata ‘de""nite future’. Verbs in any of the future tenses always occur with an aktionsart
stem.
14.2.3.1. Immediate future
The immediate future is marked with -ta. As the name suggests, -ta is used for
actions that are to be carried out in the near future. The following examples show the
use of this su#x.
The passage in (13) comes from a narrative in which the person decides to sell
her produce after seeing that others are doing well selling the fruits and plants that they
have gathered:
(13) wi ́ʃa surúktahɛi
ui=ʃasuru-ka-ta-ha-i1SG=ADDsell-INTENS-IMM.FUT-1SG.SBJ-DECL‘I am also going to sell (fruits).’654And the following question implies an immediate answer:
(14) wari ̃́ titʲámɨk?
wari ̃ ti-ta-mɨ-ka
what say+LOAF-IMM.FUT-2SG.SBJ-Q
‘What are you going to say?’The following sentence was said when the person who speaks was leaving
immediately toward her farm to bring sugar cane:

14.2.3.2. De!nite future
The de""nite future -tata conveys the idea that an action that will happen within
or at a more or less speci""c time frame. There is typically an overt indication of when
the event predicated will take place. For instance, many narratives start as in (16), with
an adverbial indication of time (‘now’) and then the use of the de""nite future on the
verb:
(16) áju húuʔ t͡sawántahui ̃ óohmatsattahɛi ɨtsán pat͡ʃi ́san

going to tell, mentioning Sun.)’
655In the next example, a war leader speaks to a man whose brother had been
killed. In the Jivaroan culture, a man had to avenge the killing of a relative. Thus the
use of the de""nite future is referring here to something that must happen:
(17) ámɨka uútipa uutɨ ́amɨka i ́ikmakt͡ʃattamɨ jat͡súmi mantútramawaranuka

Another example is given in (18). Again, notice the overt temporal indication of
when the action will happen (‘tomorrow’).

14.3. Person
The morphological position that I call ‘Person’ is where usually subjects are
marked, however, it will seen that Wampis exhibits a rather complex way of indexing
arguments on the verb structure. First, I list the su#xes used for 1, 2 and 3 persons S/A

Wampis interrogative words uruka and itura have some unusually complex
person marking. These interrogative words employ unique person su#xes that mark the
person of the subject of their clause (Table 8.8). These person markers di$er from the
set of person markers used with ""nite declarative verbs. Question words can also occur
with some subordinating su#xes (see Table 8.9 below): the person markers occur
optionally (but frequently) when the interrogative word bears the subordinating
su#xes, but they occur rarely when the interrogative word stands alone. For
comparison, person markers of declarative forms are also provided in Table 8.8 (for
analysis of person marking on verbs, see §14.3). To the best of my knowledge, these
unique interrogative-based person markers (as well as the subordinators) do not occur
with ia ‘who’, tu ‘where, which’ and uari ̃ ‘what’.","[404, 405]"

TypeSAPNon-SAPDeclarative=aita ~ =ita=aiti ~ =itiInterrogative=aita ~ =ita=aita ~ =itaExclamative=aita ~ =ita=aita ~ =itaPreterit=ia=iaThe copula clitics are used when the reference is present declarative,753interrogative and exclamative—in the latter, usually expressing surprise. The copula
clitic =aita ~ =ita is used for SAP subjects, whereas the clitic =aiti ~ =iti is used for
non-SAP, 3 person subjects. There is a copula for past reference, =ia which
rdoccasionally occurs in the data. This preterit copula clitic seems to be declining in use,
as for most referents in the past the copula verb, not the clitic, is used.
Examples (57), (58) and (59) illustrate the use of the copula clitics in attributive, proper
inclusion and equative clauses, respectively.

amɨ iat͡su-ru=ita-mɨ
2SGbrother-1SG=COP-2SG.SBJ+DECL‘You are my brother.’
An interesting note regarding the order of morphemes in interrogative clauses is
that the question marker =ka comes before the copula clitic, hinting at a more recent754grammaticalization of the clitics:
(60) warí tumɛ́int͡sukɛit?
uari ̃ tu-mai-inu-t͡su=ka=aita
what say-POT-NMLZ-INFER-Q=COP
‘How can it be said?
The next example illustrates the use of the copula clitics in exclamative setinclusion clauses. Notice that the question marker =ka can optionally occur in
exclamative sentences and may be being reanalyzed as a non-declarative marker. If the
question marker =ka occurs, the order of the morphemes is the same as in
interrogatives, i.e. the question marker precedes the copula clitic. Note that the negative
is used in this case to emphasize the idea of surprise of the expression, not in its literal
‘negation’ meaning.
(61) auʃa ɲawánt͡ʃukɛit!
au=ʃa
iauã-́ t͡ʃau=ka=aita
DIST=ADDdog-NEG.NMLZ=Q=COP.EXCL‘That is a jaguar!’
The sentence in (62) below contains an example of the use of the preterite
copula clitic. I only have a handful of occurrences of this morpheme in my data, and it
is apparently not very productive. For comparison, a question in present tense is also
presented in (63). In the data for Wampis, the copula can refer to the remote or recent
past. Notice that Overall (2007) reports a cognate remote past copula su#x -ya in755Awajun.
(62) jája óuʃa
ia=iaau=ʃawho=COP.PTDIST=ADD‘Who was that?’(63) jɛ́it óuʃa
ia=itaau=ʃawho=COPDIST=ADD‘Who is that?’
In addition, I was told by one of my teachers that a sentence like (64), which
was pronounced with the clitic, should be transcribed as presented in (65); i.e.
""corrected"" with a fully conjugated copula verb. It is possible thus that the copula clitic
=ia comes from the homophonous remote past tense marker -ia that is present in (65).
The latter might have been reanalyzed after the remote past stem a-ia (Copula-Remote
Past) was phonetically reduced.

The existential construction in Wampis, as is to be expected, is based on the
existential verb a. A location can (and usually) occur(s). The basic existential
construction is:
NP (LOC) Exist
The LOC is typically either an NP, a locational word or an adverb and it is
always marked with a locative marker. The NP subject is always nominative. The next
examples illustrate the use of existential clauses.

exist-3.SBJ-DECL‘There is a folded rope in the bowl.’757Recall that the existential verb a has no TAM restrictions attested in the data.
Morphologically, the existential verb is characterized by having a plural suppletive
allomorph aia, and by receiving the negative marker -t͡su, as explained previously in
§17.5.2.
17.5.3.3.1. Possession with existential a + applicative
The existential verb a may be su#xed with an applicative to create a possessive
stem; the possessive function might have originated in a benefactive use of the
applicative. Unlike the original existential verb a, the possessive stem with the
applicative is structurally transitive. In this possessive construction, the possessed thing
appears as the subject of the verb and the possessor as the object. The possessor is
indexed as an object on the verb if the possessor is a Speech Act Participant (SAP) as in
(69); third persons do not have an overt verbal object marker and thus are left
unmarked (70). Note that the possessed thing (the grammatical subject in the
construction) can occur without being marked as possessed, as in (71), but semantically
it is understood as possessed (hence the reason why this construction is considered as a
possession construction). The possessor can occur in an overt NP marked with the
accusative (71)—but two overt NP arguments of the verb are very rare in natural758speech, an overt NP possessor is rare.

The marking of Plural SAP’s possessor (the grammatical objects) on the verb
show a di$erent (and uncommon) pattern, as Wampis argument indexation is
morphologically and semantically complex (see §14.3.3 for details). For 1 and 2 plural
possessors, the markings on the verb vary: the possessed thing no longer formally occurs
as the subject of the verb. Instead both the object and subject markers, both referring
to the possessor, occur at the same time. Thus, no indication of the possessed thing
(a third person subject) overtly appears as the subject on the verb, as happens for the
other grammatical persons/numbers. Notice, however, that this is actually the way759Wampis marks the situation of a 3 person subject acting on a 1 or 2 plural object (i.e.
the 3 → PL.SAP scenario): the 1 or 2 plural argument is marked in both the object and
subject verb slots. Examples (72) and (73) illustrate this pattern for 1pl and 2pl
possessor:

17.5.3.3.2. Predicate locatives
Locative constructions typically involve a construal in which a Figure (an NP
that is being identi""ed) is located on a Ground (an NP that constitutes the referential
location of the Figure) (Langacker 1987; Levinson & Wilkins 2006; Talmy 2007). Many
languages employ copulas or existential verbs for the expression of spatial relations.
Other employ posture verbs or positional verbs. For Wampis, the results of a study
about the expression of spatial relations that I carried out were presented at the 2015
Society for the Study of Indigenous Languages of the Americas Annual Meeting (Peña7602015). Because of time and space constraints, only a summary is presented here.
Of the types of spatial relations as de""ned in Ameka & Levinson (2007), Wampis
actually employs most of them. Therefore, it is better to speak of di$erent strategies or
constructions for Wampis, rather than trying to ""t a strict typological parameters255
(Grinevald 2006).
The copulas and the existential can be used in predications that express spatial
notions, but a locative postposition must occur on the predicate NP, as can be observed
in (74)–(75).

nunanki mesa=nama aia-ua-ithatspear table=LOCexist.PL-3-DECL'There are spears on the table.'
Using the copula and the existential are by no means the only strategy that
Wampis uses for locational predicates. Wampis possesses a fairly sophisticated lexical
pool of verbs that are used in locatives constructions (especially for the subdomain of255. Grinevald (2006), working on a varied sample of Amerindian languages, has proposed
“intermediate” systems that allow for continuos, non-discrete, categories.","[793, 794, 795, 796, 797, 798, 799, 800, 801]"

DISCOURSE-ORIENTED AND MOOD PHRASE-LEVEL CLITICS
18.1. Introduction
This chapter describes clitics whose functions are related to indicating discourseoriented and mood information. These morphemes are best analyzed as clitics because
they exhibit very few restrictions with respect to what can be their phonological hosts,
and most of them lack a ""xed position in the sentence. The discussion begins in §18.2
with an overview of the clitics that will be analyzed throughout the chapter. Each of the
subsequent sections §18.3 through §18.10 is dedicated to describing each one of the
clitics mentioned in §18.2.
18.2. Overview
Table 18.1 lists the clitics that will studied in the next sections. With regard to
their distributions, the restrictive =kɨ, additive =ʃa and focus =ka occur most
frequently with NPs, but can also occur on verbs, adjectives and adverbs or marking
several constituents in the sentence. Speculative =ʃa, inferential =t͡su, sudden
realization and tag question =api and interrogative =ka can occur marking verbs and
nouns. The restrictive =kɨ can co-occur with other clitics, and it is very productive co769occurring with =ʃa. The additive =ʃa and the focus =ka cannot co-occur in the same
word.","[808, 809, 810]"

Time (s)jaíntáFigure 6.12. Spectrogram with pitch track for [jɛintá] ‘Help her/him!’6.7. Summary of stress and tone
It seems evident from all the previous discussion that the prosodic system of
Wampis does not really ""t well in the so-called category of “pitch accent”: stress in
Wampis is not only realized via high pitch (i.e. high tone)—this is a traditional
de""nition of “accent” (one high pitch per word); rather stress in Wampis is a mix of
articulatory cues related to vowel and consonant lengthening in addition to high pitch;
283stress is also manifested in the vowel elision patterns described in the preceding
sections. On the other hand, I have shown that in Wampis there can be more than one
phonetic realization of high tone in a word; what is more, some roots, a#xes and clitics
of di$erent nature (verbal, nominal, etc) have a lexically-speci""ed high tone. Lexicallyspeci""ed high tone disregards the stress pattern of the language. In addition to that,
high tone has functional load in the language, as it marks case. So, in light of the facts
just mentioned, how “pitch-accent” is Wampis? I argue that an answer to that question
is circular in principle, because we would have to start by giving a very ad-hoc
de""nition of “pitch-accent”, which would not ""t any well known cross-linguistic
prototype. The present attempt at analyzing Wampis prosody, on the other hand, shows
that Wampis can be analyzed in terms of two very well known prototypes of prosodic
system: stress and tone. Wampis is not a prototypical stress language nor is it a
prototypical tone language, it has features of both ends of the continuum.
6.8. The prosodic word
From the discussion above, the minimal prosodic word in Wampis is de""ned as a
word with at least two moras (i.e. two TBU), one high tone, one foot and one primary
stress. The requirement to have at least one high tone per prosodic word in Wampis is284achieved by metrical rules or by lexically specifying the high tone.
Wampis codas have an interesting behavior in the sense that they are apparently
weightless for the minimal word restriction (i.e. only vowels=TBUs are relevant). This
is important for the current analysis, as the stress pattern is centered around the tone
bearing unit (i.e. vowels).
There are some processes of cliticization where the copula and a demonstrative
occur together (in this way the demonstrative relativizes the copula), as in (55). The
copula itself can become cliticized to another word when relativized by a
demonstrative, as in (56). These constitute interesting cases where the grammatical
word and the prosodic word do not match.

6.9.1. Declarative intonation contour
Generally, declarative sentences show a decrease in pitch at the end of the
utterance. This decreasing in pitch usually is not dramatically deep—I have only rarely
found strong falling contours at the end of utterances, except of course when there is a
relatively long pause after the utterance. In this occasion, the last syllable may actually
show a deep falling contour and the vowels are pronounced very short and with low
intensity. Figure 6.13 shows an instance with a sentence that was uttered as an
introduction to a story, therefore there was a long pause before the story began. The
sentence is [húu óuhmattɛɛ̃ŋka aúhu tutɛiɲɛiti] ‘this is story is called Auhu’. Note in
particular the last sequence of the utterance ([ti]), which can be barely seen in the
spectrogram (it is indicated with an arrow). There is also a creaky voice in the
transition between the words [óuhmattɛɛ̃ŋka] and [aúhu]. Whether creaky voice is a
regular phenomenon in the prosody of words or not remains to be examined more
carefully.","[322, 323, 324, 325, 326]"

As the name indicates, reduplication is the process by which the root or stem
(or a part of it) is repeated. Reduplication of verbs and adjectives is relatively
productive in the Wampis language. In addition, numerals use partial reduplication to
convey a distributional meaning (see §8.8.1). Reduplication can be interpreted as
in/ection (to convey a grammatical function such as plurality) and as derivation (to
create new words). The basic principles of reduplication in Wampis are:• The reduplicated material usually forms its own prosodic word separate from the base
word.128• The reduplicated material always appears before the base word in partial
reduplication.","[359, 360, 361]"

314The su#xes presented in Table 7.4 have a derivational function: they create new
stems with (sometimes subtle) di$erent meanings from verbal roots. The following
examples illustrate the derivational use of some of the above su#xes:
(18)
wɨ ‘go’→wɨ-ka ‘walk, travel’ (with intensive -ka)t͡ʃit͡ʃa ‘speak’→t͡ʃit͡ʃa-ra ‘advise’ (with distributed action -ra)ihu ‘stab’→ihu-ra ‘grind, squeeze’ (with distributed action -ra)hapi ‘pull, drag’→hapi-ra ‘pull up’ → hapi-ra-ki ‘pull up to carry’ (with dis-tributed action -ra + do while moving -ki)
ahũ ‘throw in the water’→ahũ-á ‘knock down’ (with high a$ectedness)Most verbs very frequently occur with one of these su#xes to appear in certain
morphosyntactic contexts: with most past tense markers and in the future, the
aktionsart su#xes are usually required. And to mark perfective aspect, the verb plus
aktionsart stem is obligatory. For instance, the verb kankɨ frequently occurs with the
intensive su#x -ka and must occur with this su#x for ‘just-done actions’ marked with
the perfective (note that there is no apparent new meaning127 added in these cases: the127. But this is open to question. It is very di#cult to know for sure whether the aktionsart is
adding some meaning (other than grammatical) to the root in this case. Not all aktionsart
su#xes are available for every verbal root, but sometimes the verb can take a di$erent
aktionsart su#x. For instance, when adding the attenuative -sa to kankɨ, the meaning of the
action was explained to me as being a gentle or slow rolling.","[354, 355]"

11.3.1. The determined NP
The second simplest NP (the ""rst is just the noun occurring alone) is constituted
by any of the elements that typically occur preceding the noun head; i.e. a
demonstrative, tikit͡ʃi ‘other’, quanti""er, personal pronoun and aia, aiatɨk ‘only’. These
elements, in general, serve to specify the reference of the noun head, so it can be said
that they function as determiners.195 I call this the “Determined NP”.
Demonstratives have the distinctive property of triggering agreement with the
noun head and its modi""ers, as explained previously in §8.3.1.

11.3.2. The possessive construction
The simple possessive construction is done with a noun marked as possessed, the195. It is not yet clear whether there is a Determiner Phrase in Wampis. Morphosyntactically, I
have shown that all of the above mentioned elements that serve to determine an noun have very
di$erent properties and there is no evidence that they form a class (see Chapter VIII). But the
question of a Determiner Phrase merits further research—identifying tests such as coordination
is di#cult as coordination is not very relevant in Wampis. Thus, more evidence, specially in
terms of designing tests, are needed to consider a Determiner Phrase as a relevant structure in
Wampis.","[537, 538]"
"46was good/grammatical. However, I would always make an annotation that the form
was suggested by myself ""rst, and the validity of that form was always double check
with di$erent speakers for greater accuracy in the description of the speci""c form.
Elicitation was also used to ""ll gaps in my data, ""ll out paradigms and to probe aspects
of certain construction when necessary. By eliciting, I also found a few constructions
that were not present in the recorded texts.
In order to record good-quality data, particular recording equipment was used.
The basic equipment taken to the ""eld consisted of voice recorders (Marantz PMD660
for the 2008 and 2010 ""eld trips, Zoom H4N for 2013), a condenser lavalier
microphone (AudioTechnica AT831B), a head-mounted microphone (Shure SM10A-CN),
a hand/table microphone, and a semi-professional camera capable of recording high
de""nition videos (Panasonic DMC). Additional equipment used included studio monitor
headphones, a laptop computer, an external hard-drive, notebooks, and an assortment
of other devices (memories, dvd disks, cables, etc.). During the trips, the equipment was
put in waterproof cases; some equipment, like the external hard drive, were chosen
because they were rain and fresh water resistant. Physical back-ups were constantly
made using the external hard-drive and other memory devices. Once in Lima, I also47backed-up the data using an on-line internet service.
An additional observation concerns the language via which I communicated
with Wampis people and into which the data was translated. My ""rst interactions with
the Wampis people were in Spanish, until I gradually became more con""dent in using
Wampis at least in basic communicative situations. Although I am a native speaker of
Spanish, I am aware that my variety is not the same as the regional Amazonian Spanish
or the Spanish spoken by the Wampis. Many younger Wampis generations (ages 15-40
years) are also more or less /uent in Spanish. Most male Wampis between the ages of
40 to 60 speak Spanish with di$erent degrees of /uency. The number of Wampis female
speakers who can speak Spanish in this age range vary, as not all of them had access to
education in the past. Elder female speakers are usually monolingual in Wampis and
know only a few basic phrases in Spanish. Elder male speakers' knowledge of Spanish
varies depending on whether they had access to primary or in few cases secondary
school. Young children (ages 0 to 5) usually do not learn Spanish until they start school
(though they are exposed to some Spanish, especially from radio shows). Thus,
Amazonian Spanish and Wampis language interact: the Spanish acquired by the Wampis
is Amazonian but with a Wampis substrate. This Amazonian Spanish with a Wampis48substrate is the variety that was used for translations in most cases (one of my Wampis
teacher masters the Spanish spoken in the Coast of Peru, in Lima—where she attended
classes at a local university—, which is my own variety of Spanish).
Especially during my ""eldwork in 2013, my teachers and co-workers often
helped me ask questions or explain the tasks in Wampis to other Wampis speakers. They
also acted as interlocutors to make speakers feel more comfortable and generally to set
a more natural environment. When I was the only interlocutor, I tried to interact with
interviewee(s) in Wampis so that they did not feel they were in an “arti""cial” setting. In
general, I tried to establish a recording setting in which the speaker would speak to an
interlocutor and not to a microphone. Even in cases where I myself did not use Wampis
properly, I managed to create a more comfortable atmosphere to work and people felt
more compelled to expand their role to supplement information and teach me how to
say in Wampis what I wanted to communicate. This, in turn, opened additional
opportunities to ask more questions about the language. However, in cases when I was
not able to convey my thoughts using Wampis and felt communication was broken, I
resorted to Spanish to try to maximize understanding of the task at hand.
Transcription was done always with the help of my teachers, all of them native49speakers of Wampis. Literal and free translations of the texts were given in Spanish by
my Wampis teachers. As I grew con""dent in the Wampis language myself, I started to
propose translations of parts of the texts with the supervision (and not a few
corrections) of my teachers. This was done as a personal exercise to elicit data and to
gain a better understanding of the language rather than to actually translate texts—my
teachers’ translations were always considered to have authoritative status. I noticed that
most people were comfortable with the voice recorder and did not mind the lavalier
microphone, so these equipments were my ""rst choice for recording in most cases.
Recording of words and phrases for phonetic analysis was done mostly in the city of
Lima, where I could secure a quieter environment to work in.
The work/ow for processing the data was divided into several steps. After
recording in the ""eld, I backed up the data and asked the speaker(s) for a free
translation or explanation of the just-recorded text. Translations or explanations were
not always possible, as speakers would go around on their own errands, but when
speakers were available I would record or write down the translation or explanation
o$ered. Generally, I did not immediately transcribe the texts, but I invited the
interviewee to listen to the recording, provide a free translation if possible and talk with50me about the content. I always took notes during these occasions. In a few cases,
explanations were given in Spanish. At this time, I also wrote down notes about
grammar structures or interesting language use that I captured while re-listening to the
recording two or three times. Finally, I took note of phrases that speakers felt needed to
be corrected because they considered they were “ungrammatical”, “did not sound
good”, or because there was an error of performance.
Transcription and rechecking of translations into Spanish usually happened in
Jaen and Lima with other Wampis speakers. This also proved to be a useful exercise to
double-check for possible errors. I used ELAN (https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/),
a free transcribing and annotating software program, for transcriptions. In ELAN, I also
later translated the text into English. Then I exported the ELAN ""le into FLEx (http:/
/""eldworks.sil.org//ex/), a freely available software for language documentation and
analysis. The databases created in FLEx contain both a lexicon and an interlinearized
collection of texts. The interlinearized texts contain a practical orthography line, a
phonetic analysis, a morpheme-by-morpheme analysis, a literal translation in Spanish,
and free translations in Spanish and English, plus they include additional notes
explaining either grammatical or cultural points.","[86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91]"

CLOSED WORD CLASSES
8.1. Introduction
This chapter is dedicated to closed word classes, which are those that are
composed of “a ""xed and usually small number of members” (Schachter & Shopen
2007: 3). The closed classes of Wampis are: pronouns, demonstratives, interrogative
words, non-numeral quanti""ers, numerals, interjections and grammatical particles.
There are two words that do not ""t in any category and constitute their own classes:
tikit͡ʃi ‘other’ and uɨantu ‘group’. In addition, due to their morphosyntactic properties I
also discuss in this chapter two word classes that are not strictly closed: ideophones and
adverbs. Ideophones are an open class in the sense that the most simple way to create a
new ideophone is by imitating any sound, so the inventory of ideophones can always be
expanded in theory. The reason for considering adverbs in this chapter is that the only
adverbializer in Wampis (which only derives time-adverbs) is no longer productive in
the language; hence, in practice Adverbs constitute a semi-closed class. The word
classes are presented in this way: §8.2 describes pronouns, §8.3 provides an analysis of
determiners, which is followed by a description of the word tikit͡ʃi ‘other’ in §8.4.
329Question words are analyzed in §8.5. Adverbs are analyzed in §8.6. Sections §8.7 and
§8.8 describe non-numeral and numeral quanti""ers, respectively. Section §8.9 discuses
the word uɨantu ‘group’, and §8.10 discusses the (little) evidence for conjunctions.
Interjections and ideophones are described in §8.11 and §8.12, respectively. Finally,
§8.13 comments on two grammatical particles found in Wampis.
8.2. Pronouns
Pronouns constitute a class of words that are free forms and that can ""ll the
position of an NP in a clause. Pronouns are referential devices that need an anaphoric
or cataphoric referent in the discourse. In Wampis, pronouns generally have most of the
distributional and morphological properties of nouns. However, di$erently from nouns,
pronouns cannot be possessed and cannot be modi""ed. Pronouns do not receive
vocative case either.
8.2.1. Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns are related to the distinction of grammatical person. Wampis
distinguishes between singular and plural personal pronoun forms. Table 8.1 shows the
personal pronouns found in Wampis.","[368, 369, 370]"
"102§3.2.3.3), the glottal stop does occur in native Wampis words, though most of them are
interjections. Here are some examples where the glottal occurs:
(32) /haʔa/‘yes’(33) /ɨt͡sã tɨaʔai ̃/‘time between 1-3 p.m.’59(34) /kiaʔai ̃/‘at sunset’(35) /aiʔai/‘beetle sp.’All in all, the best arguments for considering the glottal as a phoneme despite its
marginal distribution in the Wampis system are: a) the glottal stops in these words
cannot be omitted; i.e. they are integral part of the word, or the words are otherwise
considered incorrect; b) there are indeed contrastive pairs with other consonants (cf.
/haʔa/ [haʔá] ‘yes’ vs /hat ̪á/ [hat ̪á] ‘die!’); and c) its occurrence would not be
explainable by other means such as allophony or contact.
3.2.3. Nasal consonants
Wampis has bilabial /m/ and an alveolar /n/ nasal segments. The velar nasal
[ŋ], which was considered as a phoneme by Beasley and Pike (1957), is not considered59. This expression is composed of ɨt͡sã ‘sun’ and the root tɨa ‘incline’. The analysis of tɨaʔai ̃ is a
bit complicated as the word is already lexicalized, but it is possible that etymologically it comes
from tɨa ‘incline’ and a=i ̃ ‘copula=Locative’; i.e. its literal meaning would be ‘when the sun is
inclining’. Many words and expressions referring to the parts of the day in Wampis include a
description of a position of the sun (“incline”, “vertical”, etc.). It is possible that the glottal was
inserted between words, an optional process that is still observed in current Wampis. The same
cluster /ʔai ̃/ occurs in example (34).","[142, 143]"
"The person markers on the left hand within the “Interrogative person markers”
column in Table 8.8 mostly occur with interrogative words:
(58) urúkakrumɨa aʃámarmɨ
uruka-ku-rumɨaaʃama-rumɨhow+IPFV-SIM-2PLbe.afraid+IPFV-2PL.SBJ‘Why are you (PL) afraid?’
There are rare examples of the person markers listed in Table 8.8 occurring on
the verb instead of on the interrogative word:
(59) urúkak nɨkápɨamɨa
uruka=kunɨkapɨ-a-mɨahow+IPFV=SIMfeel-IPFV-2SG‘How are you feeling?’
On the other hand, the person-marking forms on the right hand within the
“Interrogative person marker” column occur in subordinate verbs and optionally in366question words as a variants of the su#xes on the left hand144 (see Chapter XIX for a
complete analysis of subordination in Wampis).
From Table 8.8, it seems that interrogative-word person markers are historically
complex, containing an erstwhile person su#x and the formative *a. This vowel a is
probably related to the copula a (see §17.5) that has been reanalyzed as part of the
person marker. It is possible that the copula a was “recycled” after itself being dropped
at a previous historical stage, e.g. *uruka a-sa-mɨ ‘how COP-SUB-2SG > uruka ∅-sa-mɨ >
uruka-sa-mɨ a ‘how-SUB-2SG COP’ > uruka-sa-mɨa ‘how-SUB-2SG’. In fact, constructions with
a morphologically simple interrogative word and a separate subordinated copula can
still be found in the language:
(60) óo urúk asán nuwɨ ́m aánia
auurukaa-sa-ninuɨ-mɨaani-aDISThowCOP-SUB-3SGwife\POSS-2SG do.that-IPFV‘Why is your wife like that?’
As stated in the preceding discussion, the interrogative words derived from uru
and itura can also carry some subordinating morphology, as well as the switch-reference
-matai ̃. The subordinating and switch-reference morphemes found on interrogatives are
indicated in Table 8.9.","[406, 407]"

Ideophones are sound-symbolic words, i.e. words that provide a “vivid
representation in sound . . . in respect to manner, colour, sound, smell, action, state or
intensity” (Doke 1935: 118) and whose “meanings are in the domain of sensory
imagery” (Dingemanse 2014: 387). Ideophones are widespread in languages of the
Amazonia (Payne 1999a) and they are certainly very important in Wampis discourse. I
include onomatopoetic words (words that mimic phonetically the source of sound they
try to describe) in the class of ideophones.
Ideophones may present irregular phonological structure. However, an
interesting ""nding in Wampis is that many ideophones are formed based on the
template CVCV(C) (see Table 8.21 for examples).
Ideophones in Wampis can function adverbially (an important presence in that
414function), modifying predicates. The following examples illustrate this pattern. In (130),
the ideophone tapi ́t modi""es the verb ‘grab’. Tapi ́t is an ideophone that conveys the
meaning of grabbing something or someone suddenly or forcefully. It frequently occurs
with at͡ʃi ‘grab’.

driving an object into the soil.

IDEOIDEOembed+HIAF-3PL.SS‘[They] Having taken spears, around the ""rewood t͡sakɨt! [they] having embedded [the

descriptive or circumstantial modi""er but they can occur without a verb and still depict
415an event, action or situation, i.e. they are capable of recreating “aspects of sensory
imagery, much like quotations recreate aspects of the experience of the quoted speech”
(Dingemanse 2014: 388).165 For instance, in (132), the ideophone pɨh, which conveys
the idea of jumping, su#ces to recreate the action that it depicts; without any cooccurring verb:
(132) naŋki ́ at͡ʃi ́k huni ́ pɨ ́h huni ́ pɨ ́h

spear, over here, pɨ ́h!, over here, pɨ ́h!’)In the same vein, in (133) the ideophone parát, which depicts an object falling

IDEO‘The owl fell into the ""re!’ (Lit.: ‘The owl into the ""re parat!’)When used in discourse, ideophones that imitate or are associated to the sounds165. Nuckolls (1996) also calls attention to the performative nature of ideophones, which
involve speakers’ iconic and indexical gestures and particular intonational dynamics (raising or
lowering in pitch, lengthening of sounds, and so on). A study of ideophones involving all of these
aspects is beyond the scope of this dissertation and may constitute an exciting topic for future
endeavors.","[452, 453, 454, 455, 456]"
"762is plural and inanimate, either irunu ‘crowd together, reunite, pile up’ or mat͡sa ‘inhabit,
be/get plural’ is used.257 If X is a singular inanimate entity, the answer usually involves
a postural verb (see below). Di$erent examples of the use of these verbs are given in the
following examples. Notice that, when used with the applicative, mat͡sa typically refers
to human beings living/being together (thus notice the di$erence in the use of the
applicative between (77) and (78)).(76) hɨɰã ́ puháwɛɛ

"• The existential a has no major TAM restrictions.
The following sentences are examples of di$erent non-present declarative moods where
the copula a is used. They include instances of the copula carrying the distant past
marker (18), a future nominalizer (19), the jussive su#x (20), and the hortative (21).

annatto‘Truly, let us be the annatto tree.’ (i.e. ‘Let’s transform into the annatto tree.’)
In present tense declarative (22) and interrogatives (23), the copula clitics are
used. Notice that the copula clitics do not occur in other moods, except in exclamative
(24).
(22) ɛ́ɛʃmaŋkuitmɨ

‘Who are you?’(24) mijá pɨ ́ŋkɨrɛitʲa!

INTSgood=COP.EXCL‘How beautiful [it] is!’
The copula verb can occur in questions only if they are not present tense
declarative, or if there is no indication of temporal ground. In the following example,
the speaker wonders why the hummingbird has not appeared and uses the copula a741subordinated with the su#x -sa:251
(25) hɨmpɨ ́ʃa urúka ásan naŋkámat͡ʃmia?
hɨmpɨ=ʃauru-ka a-sãnankama-t͡ʃa-mia?hummingbird=ADDhow-Q COP-SUB/3SG.SS pass.through-NEG-DIST.PT‘Why the hummingbird did not appeared?’
An interesting overlap in the use of the copula verb and copula clitics occurs
with plural subjects. In non-attributive clauses, both the copula verb and the copula
clitics can be used:
(26) wabálnumiajɛithi
Huabal=numa=ia=aita-hi
Huabal=LOC=ABL=COP=1PL.SBJ+DECL
‘We are from Huabal.’(27) wabálnumia ɛ́ɛʲɲahi
Huabal=numa=iaa-ina-hiHuabal=LOC=ABLCOP-PL.IPFV-1PL.SBJ‘We are from Huabal.’
On a side (but interesting) note, the copula clitic can also be attached to Spanish
words in code switching. The following example comes from a dialogue, with one of the
speakers switching to Spanish occasionally. It can be observed that the copula clitic
attaches to the Spanish past participle form for ‘paid’ (28) and ‘coordination’ (30). If we251. Example (25) comes from a text relating the context in which many Wampis and Awajun
people were protesting some laws passed by the government that could potentially a$ect their
ecosystem. The non-appearance of hɨmpɨ ‘hummingbird’ is regarded as a bad sign.","[780, 781, 782]"

I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the Wampis people who taught me
so much more than their language, specially to Juan Luis Nuningo Puwai and his
family, Shapiom Noningo Sesén, Atilio Nuningo Noningo, Andrés Nuningo Graña, Dina
Ananco Ahuananchi, Lidia Wajarai, Clara Navarro, Josué Yacum, Eder Yacum, and
Óscar Jimpikit and his family. I am grateful to the Wampis leaders Juan Luis Nuningo,
Julio Hinojosa and Alfonso Graña for allowing me to carry out my research and for
helping me make contacts in di$erent communities of Kanus.
In Jaén, my appreciation to the people of Centro Waimaku and to the Carranza
family for welcoming me at their house at di$erent times while traveling for ""eld work.
I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Professor Doris L. Payne, for
supporting me all these years. I really do not know where I would be without Doris’
guidance; certainly not ""nishing a dissertation. She has very patiently read and re-read
through every piece of this work and has given my chaotic thoughts a legible form. Our
conversations have greatly enriched my understanding not only of language, but of how
to do research in general. Scott DeLancey and Spike Gildea are great professors and
scholars, and great people. As their student or assistant, I have learned a lot from them.
I am honored to have them in my committee and grateful for their comments and
criticism. I am grateful to Claudia Holguín for supporting my project since we met for
the ""rst time and for her comments on my work.
ixAll of my friends at the Department of Linguistics of the University of Oregon
have helped me keep my sanity at acceptable levels, especially Rosa Vallejos (and Óscar
and Álvaro), Michael Ahland, Yolanda Valdez. Shahar Shirtz, Manuel Otero, Danielle
Barth, Ellen Kress and Matt Stave provided insightful comments on the Wampis data or
helped with my questions about English. My thanks also to all of my professors and sta$
at the Department of Linguistics and to the people at Romance Languages, with whom I
worked when I started my graduate career in Oregon. My research was supported by
the Department of Linguistics, a 2008 Summer Research Grant by the Center for Latino/
Latina and Latin American Studies, and a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant
awarded by the National Science Foundation (Award 1226222).
I would be nowhere without the love and support of my parents, Isaac Jaime
and Zadith. My sister Ketty has been my best friend since before I was born, and I am
always happy to see her, her husband Yuri and my nephew Iván. My in-laws are always
supportive of our endeavors, I am especially grateful to Teresa Arellano for everything
she has done for us.
I am indebted to Adriana Da Silva, who has helped me greatly with the maps.
Adriana not only found time to help me, but also to be a great mother to our sons
Joaquín Alejandro, Nicolás Jaime and Octavio Carlo. All of you are the greatest thing to
ever happened upon me. Language fails me to express how much I love you all.xTo the Wampis People.
To the memory of the dear people who left this physical world while I was
writing this dissertation, especially my grandmother Migue and my Oregonian brother
James D. Wood.
To Adriana, to my parents, to Joaquín, Nicolás and Octavio.xiTABLE OF CONTENTS

INTRODUCTION
1.1. Introduction
This dissertation o$ers a comprehensive grammar of the Wampis (Huambisa)
language, as it is currently spoken in the Santiago river1 area of Peru. The language
name is written <Wampís> (the underlying form is /uampisa/, which is pronounced
[wampi ́s]) by the speakers); therefore, assuming there is no accent mark in the English
alphabet, throughout this dissertation I will use the term Wampis to refer to the
language. The present work is based mainly on the variety spoken in the Middle
Santiago, in the communities of Puerto Galilea, Huabal and Boca Chinganaza; and on
the Upper Santiago variety as spoken in the community of Candungos. Though some
di$erences between the Middle and Upper Santiago varieties occur and will be referred
to in some parts of this work, no major statements about Wampis internal variation will
be made (however, some basic notes on this topic are given in §1.6.1). The claims made
in this work are based on the analysis of primary data gathered via extensive ""eldwork
in Wampis communities. Wampis is spoken by around 10,000 people in the1. The Santiago river is known by the name of Kanus (/kanusa/) by the Wampis.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"
"The su#x -(n)i ̃ has two forms. The form -i ̃ occurs when the preceding vowel is
not /i/ and the form -ni ̃ occurs when there is a preceding /-i/. The marking of 1SG and 3
persons is neutralized in simultaneous DS clauses. Notice from Table 19.8 that the 2
person markers -mi change their usual last vowel /ɨ/ when they precede -(n)i ̃.268
However, before -(n)i they occur as -mi and -rumi respectively. An alternative analysis
would be that underlyingly the second person ends in /ɨ/ and this vowel undergoes268. In other paradigms, including the person markers of ""nite verbs, 2sg is -mɨ and 2pl is -rumɨ,
both ending in vowel /ɨ/.",[848]
"Table 12.2. Auxiliary verbs in Wampis

Other lexical types of verbs
12.5.1. Lexically negative verbs
Some verbs in Wampis are lexically inherently negative, i.e. they do not538necessitate any negative morpheme in order to change their polarity. Examples of this
are tuhina ‘be unable, have di#culty’, nakita ‘not want’203 and kaninma204 ‘not ""t (in a
space)’.
12.5.2. Verbs that lexicalize a speci!c type of patient or location
The lexical content of Wampis verb roots can have very rich/speci""c content
and provide inherent information about the object or location that need not be
mentioned—of course, many of these meanings are culturally-speci""c. Some verbs also
include manner information in their lexical representation. To give a sense of what can
be found in the Wampis lexicon (at the level of the root) here is a short list of verb roots
that are di#cult to gloss with one or two words:
(8)
aɨpa‘leave/put on /oor or bed’apa‘put a bite in mouth (also applies to putting bites of manioc during the process
of preparing manioc beer)’apuha ‘put on ""nger’
at͡sɨnu ‘put on a garment for the head’203. The source of this verb is probably the adjective naki ‘lazy’. The portion -ta may be a
variant of an old verbalizer -tu.
204. The underlying form of this verb likely is kaninVma, as the third vowel would be always
dropped due to the vowel elision process explained in Chapter VI. Thus the root would be kaninV
plus the re/exive -ma. Synchronically, I have not found an etymon for the (apparent) root
kaninV.","[578, 579]"
"808harmony with the vowel /-i ̃/. This morphonological change would in turn trigger the
occurrence of the consonant n in the form -ni ̃ (likely as a means of dissimilation, as the
form -ni ̃ also occurs following the 1PL marker -ri, which also has an /i/).
Based on homophony and morphophonological properties, the most obvious
source of the DS -(n)i ̃ is the locative =(n)i ̃ (described in §11.5.1.2). The -i ̃ of =(n)i ̃ is
probably also present in the other DS su#xes, -tai ̃ and -matai ̃, though in those cases the
development may have followed further steps (the portion /tai ̃/ seems to correspond to
the patient/location nominalizer -tai ̃).
19.5. Non-temporal subordination
19.5.1. Same subject -sa
Non-temporal subordination is done with the su#x -sa in SS clauses. This su#x
is used as a general SS manner subordinator. The su#x -sa attaches to an unmarked
root. As the name indicates, non-temporal subordination indicates that the event of the
subordinate clause is concomitant to that of the reference clause, without indication of
a temporal relation between the dependent and the reference clause per se—however, a
relative temporal meaning can be obtained depending on the context. For instance, in
(5), there are two clauses marked with -sa that adopt a cause meaning. The ""rst809subordinate clause marked with -sa was interpreted by my Wampis teacher as past tense
and prior to the event of the main clause. The second subordinate clause marked with
the su#x -sa was interpreted as present habitual269 whereas the main verb was
interpreted as past with the intensive aktionsart su#x -ka giving the stem a perfective
sense.

grow plants too, she stayed [to live] in the corner270.’269. I asked the speaker if a past tense interpretation was possible and the answer was
a#rmative. The point is that in a non-temporal construction, there is no intrinsically established
temporal reference; any temporal interpretation comes from the context, not from the
subordinator itself.
270. By ‘corner’ the speaker means on the outskirts of the village, where there is more free room
for farming.","[848, 849, 850]"

Lidia WajaraiF45Teacher, culture expert42CandungosAnother interesting issue that arose during my ""eldwork is the importance and
value of responding to suggestions and felt needs of community members in data
collections and language events. One thing that I do not usually ""nd in the published
literature is an exercise on detailing what could be the perspective of the speakers of a
language during ""eldwork. Usually the speakers’ perspectives are displaced to a
secondary role to give room to the researcher’s description of his/her own project
(which is necessary but not the only important thing). What do speakers of a language
want, speci""cally, in a language project? Answers, of course, will vary from speaker to
speaker and from project to project. Perhaps because it is obvious (and we always lose
track of the obvious), it somehow took me by surprise to ""nd that the Wampis wanted
to do things with their language, above all. Surely like any other community of people,
they are very conscious of their culture and language. Most of my Wampis interlocutors
agreed that to have a reference grammar for their language would be very important—
it is a serious endeavor for them. But the idea of a grammar is somewhat abstract and
di#cult to grasp, even for the grammarian! It was in the little struggles of everyday life,
though, that I realized that there were many language-related concerns the Wampis
people wanted to deal with: they want a dictionary; they have problems translating43laws and documents as the language has yet to develop jargon for speci""c ""elds; there
are people interested in recording voice or video to narrate stories for their children;
they need native-language texts for school; some wanted to tell the Wampis perspective
of recent events in Peruvian history so that it be on record for future generations;
people would ask me to create a CD with the story they had told me or the songs they
had sung so they can listen to them afterwards; some would ask me to record a message
in my computer or camera to deliver to a relative in Bagua, or Jaen; and so on. Most
Wampis speakers agreed to teach me and collaborate with me because they wanted to
give something back to their community and to their children: they feel my research
would not a$ect them because they were already adult or “old”, but it could bene""t the
new generations. There was a sense of cultural awareness that needed to be passed onto
the future. Thus, language is indeed a constant concern in the life of the Wampis. Their
concerns have been also incorporated in the current work and have actually expanded
my knowledge of Wampis. A speci""c morpheme, the allative, for example, which were
not yet present (the allative is not frequently used in general) in the natural speech data
I had yet recorded, appeared in one text that one of my teachers suggested we record.
He wanted to have a written history of the foundation of his community, Candungos—44in part because his father had been one of the founders. His story was transcribed,
printed and photocopied at a later time in the nearest town where there was access to
printers (Santa María de Nieva), and handed back to my teacher. What is more,
following up with the discussion of the story, my teacher also told me that his father
had made friends with a Spanish gold miner and rubber tradesman from the late
rubber boom times (1930’s-1950’s). Thus, new texts were collected and a discussion of
those troublesome times from the Wampis perspective ensued. This is an example of
how engaging in a community and giving a proper place to community speakers’ needs
expanded the practical and intellectual horizons of this project.
1.10.2. Data, data gathering and processing
The bulk of the data presented in the current work comes from the analysis of
about 10 hours of transcriptions of texts in the Wampis language, plus data written
down in seven notebooks. Data in notebooks usually contain vocabulary lists, notes on
diverse aspects of the language (from word pronunciations to speci""c syntactic
constructions), a few texts that could not be recorded with the voice-recorder, a few
text transcriptions of recorded material, cultural notes and elicited data.
The texts recorded belong to various genres, with the majority being45monologues comprising mythical and historical narrations, but there are also
biographies, procedural texts, descriptions, expositions (revolving around Wampis
cultural themes) and oratory. There are also conversations, jokes, songs31 and even three
short tongue-twisters that I was taught “to better my Wampis pronunciation”.
While this dissertation relies on the analysis of natural texts, I have also used
elicitation as a methodological tool to gather additional data and to understand the
data. For elicitation, I used two types of “sessions”: the ""rst type were sessions
dedicated to elicitation—I would sometimes reserve at least one hour of work to elicit
data with my teachers. The second type was more informal, but more consistently
carried out: elicitation done in the process of text transcription and translation.
Invariably, we would always ""nd that a certain phrase or word could be said in an
alternative way. I readily wrote down these observations in a notebook as well as
elicited phrases that helped us investigate where and how these alternative
constructions could be used. For elicitation tasks, I tried not to rely only on translations
of Spanish into Wampis, but rather would often propose a Wampis phrase and ask if it31. I would like to thank Dina Ananco Ahuananchi, one of my Wampis teachers, for allowing me
to digitalize four old cassettes with music in Wampis and Awajún that belonged to her family.
Part of those cassettes’ contents were added to my database to be analyzed.","[82, 83, 84, 85, 86]"
"703in the grammar of Wampis where one can see an old Jivaroan instrumental, probably
historically con/ated with the locative, in the nominalizer -tai ̃. This is an speculative
suggestion that remains to be more thoroughly analyzed.
15.4.5. Set II nominalizer -u, ‘subject nominalizer’
The subject nominalizer -u encodes di$erent semantic roles—agent, experiencer/
undergoer, force—all of which map onto the A/S participant of the verb. Unlike -inu,
which encodes prototypically animate agentive participants, -u can denote an animate
or inanimate participant. For descriptive convenience, I use the term “subject
nominalizer” to refer to the nominalizer -u. As mentioned in §15.3, an important feature
of Set II nominalizers is that, unlike Set I nominalizers, they can nominalize verb stems
which have aspectual information.
(21)
Examples with the imperfective -a
arakama ‘plant’→arakama-a-u [arákmou]‘planter’ha‘be sick’→ha-a-u [háoo]‘sick person’nɨka‘know’→nɨka-a-u [nɨkóo]‘wise’t͡ʃit͡ʃa‘speak’→t͡ʃit͡ʃa-a-u [t͡ʃit͡ʃóo]‘speaker’Examples with aktionsart (perfective stem), -ra ‘distributed action, -ka ‘intensive’
auama ‘cut hair’→auama-ra-u [awámaru]ha‘be sick’→ha-ka-u [hakóo]unuima ‘learn’→unuima-ra-u [unúimaru]→ɨɨma-ka-u [ɨɨ ́mkoo]‘one who cut his/her hair’‘dead, corpse’
‘educated’(‘onelearned’)
ɨɨma‘go forward’704‘one who went forward’whoɨsa‘burn’manka ‘get fat’→ɨsa-ka-u [ɨ ́saku]‘what/who burned’→manka-ra-u [maŋkáru]‘one who got fat’mina‘soften, melt’ →mina-ra-u [mi ́naru]‘what became softened or melted’kau‘rot’kau-ra-u [kouróo]‘rotten meat’→From the above examples, it can be seen that while there is some overlap
between Set II -u and Set I -inu (§15.4.1) (for instance, the grammatical realization of
the semantic role of the participants they denote is the subject of the nominalized verb),
there are also some di$erences. The most notable di$erence is the ability of Set II -u to
attach to aspectual stems, either imperfective or perfective. This allows Set II -u
nominalizations to be able to actualize interpretations of the action of the nominalized
verb in a scale of time (via the aspectual construal). Compare:
(22)
a. kana-u
sleep+IPFV-NMLZ
‘one who sleeps’ or ‘one who is sleeping’b. kana-ka-u
sleep.PFV-INTENS-NMLZ
‘one who slept’c. kanu-inu
sleep-NMLZ
‘sleeper’705In (a) and (b), we can obtain interpretations of the nominalized verb as being
currently occurring or already occurred, respectively. By contrast, in (c) no such
interpretation(s) is/are possible, because the action of the nominalized verb is now a
property of the referent of the derived noun. This di$erence has important
consequences in the grammar: in Chapter XX, we will see that Set II nominalizers are
used primarily in modifying function (i.e. relative clauses), whereas Set I nominalizers
are used primarily in predicative functions.
15.4.6. Set II nominalizer -mau, ‘non-subject nominalizer’
Three main derivational properties are related to the su#x -mau: a) it creates a
noun that is understood as the patient or location of a verb; b) it creates a noun that is
understood as an action nominalizer; c) -mau also creates a stem to create locative
nominalizations, most frequently with the locative =nVma. To contrast -mau with the
other member of Set II, -u ‘subject nominalizer’, I use the term ‘non-subject nominalizer’
to refer to -mau. Historically, -mau likely developed from an old su#x *-ma plus the
nominalizer -u described in the preceding section. A likely source is the same morpheme
that is the modern the non-canonical switch-reference marker -ma ‘subject to object’
(see §19.10.1). Similarly to -u, -mau can attach to an aspectualized stem. Examples of706derivation with -mau are presented in (23).
(23)
nakuma ‘draw’→nakumɨ-a-mau ‘drawing (‘something that is being drawn’)(draw.IPFV-IPFV-NMLZ)
t͡sua ‘heal’→t͡sua-a-mau [t͡suwámu] ‘one that is healed’ (heal-IPFV-IPFV-→amu-ka-mau ‘""nished, exterminated’ (""nish-INTENS-IPFV-→nakuma-ka-mau [nakúmkamu] ‘drawing (something thatNMLZ)amu ‘""nish’
NMLZ)nakuma ‘draw’is already drawn’ (draw-INTENS-IPFV-NMLZ)
The nominalizer -mau also appears to derive nouns whose interpretation seems
to be that of an action nominalizer.
(24)
ha‘be sick’→ha-á-mau [haámu]‘death’ (be.sick-HIAF-NMZL)uutu ‘cry’→uutu-mau [uútmoo] ‘cry (N)’ɨmɨma ‘be proud’→ɨmɨma-mau [ɨmɨmamu] ‘pride’In relation to its ability to create action nominalizations, -mau is sometimes also
used to give a citation form of verbs.
The nominalizer -mau is also used to derived nouns that denote a location of the
action of the verb, cf. akiina ‘be born’ → akiina-mau [aki ́iɲamu] ‘birth’ or ‘place where
one is born’; arakama ‘plant (V)’ → arakama-a-mau [arákmamu] (plant-IPFV-IPFV-NMLZ)
‘what is planted (i.e. seeds, etc.)’ or ‘farm (sown ""eld)’. In most cases, however, -mau
needs to carry a locative marker to derive location nominalizations, most frequently -707mau occurs with the locative =nVma, as in shown (25).
(25)
puha ‘live+IPFV’ → puha-mau=nama [puhámunam] ‘where we live’
amu ‘""nish’ → amu-a-mau=nama [amúamunam] ‘where something the ends’, ‘end’
(""nish-IPFV-NMLZ=LOC)
The use of -mau in locative relativizations is described more in detail in §20.2.2
and §20.4
15.4.7. Negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau
The nominalizer -t͡ʃau can occurred attached to a root or aspectual stem. It
negates the element to which it attaches.
(26)
t͡ʃit͡ʃa‘speak’→t͡ʃit͡ʃa-t͡ʃau [t͡ʃi ́t͡ʃat͡ʃu] ‘quiet person’, ‘mute’kaka‘be strong’→kakait͡ʃau [kakɛ́it͡ʃu] ‘weak one’, ‘lazy one’nɨka‘know’→nɨkat͡ʃau [nɨkat͡ʃau]→surima-t͡ʃau [suri ́mt͡ʃoo]surima ‘be stingy’‘ignorant’ (‘one who does not know’)
‘generous person’The nominalizaer -t͡ʃau have developed from the negative verbal su#x -t͡ʃa and
Set II -u ‘agent nominalizer’. The nominalizer -t͡ʃau can also combine with adjectives,
other nouns and some adverbs, which indicates that formative -t͡ʃa in the nominalizer t͡ʃau is no longer analyzed by speakers as a verbal-only morpheme, hence -t͡ʃau is
analyzed as a synchronically unanalyzable morpheme.
15.4.8. Nominalizer -na
The nominalizer -na does not have a productive derivational function, but for
708sake of completeness it is described here. The nominalizer -na occurs with the potential
stem (formed with -mai), as shown in (27), and relativizing verbs after the person
marker, as shown in (28).

SINGLE VERB CONSTRUCTIONS WITH LEXICAL VERBS, AND
NOTES ON WORD ORDER AND ALIGNMENT
16.1. Introduction
Chapter XVI explores the syntactic constructions which involve only one lexical
verb as a main ""nite verb. The discussion begins with some notes on word order in
§16.2, followed by a description of the Wampis alignment pattern in §16.3, which
constitutes a typologically uncommon syntactic pattern. Next, §16.4 describes the
intransitive construction in Wampis. After a short note on copular constructions §16.5,
§16.6 and §16.7 describe the transitive and ditransitive construction in Wampis,
respectively. Finally, §16.8 and §16.9 describe the Wampis quotative and possession
constructions, respectively.
16.2. Notes on constituent order
In Wampis, the most basic verbal construction is a simple intransitive clause;
that is, an intransitive verb marked for aspect, tense, person, and mood. The verb can
stand alone to achieve a predication, not other constituent is needed.","[743, 744, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749, 750]"
"• Forms derived with -tika typically occur when referring to a less agentive subject or544with prominent non-subjects (typically objects) of the next clause.
The following examples help illustrate the use of these type of verbs. In (16), an
agentive 1 plural subject prepares the manioc beer in line (a). Then the resumptive
derived verb imani ‘do much’ occurs at the beginning of line (b) re-referencing the
action of clause (a) and indicating continuity of the same 1 plural subject in clause (b)
(which also continues as subject in line c).

resumptive verb nutika ‘do that’ is an (non-agentive) experiencer subject of the stative
verb ‘be angry’:

In the next example, two overt topical object NPs follow a verb derive with -tika

12.7. Basic structure of the Wampis verb
In Wampis, an independent verb cannot consist of just a verb root. The root (or
simple stem) must be obligatorily marked for aspect, tense, person and mood. The
marking of Tense-Aspect-Mood (TAM) involves three kinds of devices: “derivational”
perfective su#xes, more “in/ectional” tense su#xes, and auxiliary+nominalization
constructions. The perfective aspect is obtained in the use of some derivational
morphemes that, following (Overall 2007), are termed “aktionsart”. Past and future
tenses are marked with su#xes, but actually the TAM system is greatly expanded with a
series of copular constructions involving nominalizations that have been
grammaticalized to express several TAM distinctions. Present tense is zero-marked.
Beyond the obligatory morphemes, there are several morphological positions in
the Wampis verb. A position class schema of the Wampis verb structure is presented in
Table 12.5.

Note: The morphological access to the Object and Person slots varies according to an uncommon
hierarchical agreement that is explained in Chapter XIV.","[584, 585, 586, 587, 588]"
"Morphologically, Set I and Set II di$er in one important property: with the
exception of the future nominalizer -tinu, Set I nominalizing su#xes can occur on bare
roots, but they do not attach to an aspectualized verb stem. In contrast, Set II
morphemes can be attached to an aspectualized stem, as de""ned in §15.2. In addition,
the Set II subject nominalizer -u, and Set I future nominalizer -tinu and patient/location
694nominalizer -tai ̃ can combine with the verbal negative su#x -tʃa. The distributional
properties of Set I and Set II nominalizers are listed in Table 15.4. I also add
information about the nominalizer -na, which combines with the potential stem marked
by -mai ‘potential’, as well as the negative nominalizer -tʃau.","[734, 735]"

‘killers [of my brother]’105
An alternative analysis is to propose that a glide [w] is inserted at the105. In the text where the example comes from, the expression refers to the killers of the brother
of the protagonist of the story. In particular, the applicative refers to the fact that the action is
being done to the detriment of the protagonist.","[243, 244]"
"674mother becomes upset at the child’s behavior:
(54) juákia
iu-á-kia
eat-HIAF-FAM.IMP
‘Eat!’ (Order given with anger)
However, -kia can also occur with the attenuative; thus the sentiment of ‘anger’
must be related to the familiar sense of this su#x, rather than being an intrinsic
property of the su#x. Notice that with the attenuative, the familiar imperative surfaces
with the reduced form [sia].
(55) ii ́sia huní wɨ ́arɨ ̃
ii-sa-kiahu=niwɨ-ara-ɨ ̃see-ATT-FAM.IMPPROX=ALLgo-PL-3.PFV‘Look! They went over here.’
The plural for the familiar imperative is done by adding a form that surfaces as
[rua]. This can be hypothesized as a phonological reduction of the plural -ara, the
subject nominalizaer –u, and the copula a; i.e. a nominalization construction (‘be ones
who [do] X’!). For the moment, I gloss -rua as a plural imperative form, as I have few
examples of this enabling a more general statement.

The jussive involves the expression of positive commands, desires or permission
directed toward a third person addressee. The jussive is marked with the su#x -ti. The
jussive has probably arisen from the historical con/ation of the immediate future -ta
and the third person marker -ĩ, although there is no trace of nasalization in the jussive
(but recall that -i ̃ surfaces very often as an oral vowel (cf. §14.3.2)).

anen (magical song) too, saying “Let Nunkui give me [good luck]”.’In concordance with the aktionsart stem to which the jussive attaches, the plural
is marked with the non-imperfective plural marker -ara, which, as was seen, is used for
3 persons (§5.4.2).
(58) juáwarti
iu-áu-ara-ti
eat-HIAF-PL-JUSS
‘Let them eat!’
The hortative also functions as a counterpart of the imperative in reported676speech. Thus, in the next example taken from a conversation, the command is
understood as addressing the interlocutor:
(59) káʃi miɲi ́ti túsa turámɨnawɛɛ wilsonhɛi ̃
kaʃiuini-titu-satu-rama-ina-ua-iwilson-hai ̃tomorrowcome.PFV-TIsay-SUB say-2.OBJ-PL.IPFV-3.SBJ-DECLWilson-COM‘They tell you to come with Wilson tomorrow.’ (Lit.: ‘Saying “Tomorrow that he comes”,
they tell you, “with Wilson”.’
14.4.3.4. Hortative
The hortative -mi signals the speaker appeal or encouragement toward the
addressee to bring about a future state of a$airs. The hortative is generally understood
as having a ‘you+me’ subject .
(60) umármi
uma-ra-mi
drink.PFV-DISTR-HORT
‘Let’s drink.’When there is more than one addressee, the plurality of addressees is marked
with the non-imperfective plural -ara, which goes before the hortative su#x.
(61) umárarmi
uma-ra-ara-mi
drink-DISTR-PL-HORT
‘Let’s drink.’
There is another su#x -tai that seems to also function as an hortative. In the
data gathered for Wampis, it is mostly found mostly in formulaic phrases, as in (62).
677(62) arúm wɛi ́ɲiatɛi
aruma uai-nai-a-tai
latersee-RECIP-IPFV-HORT‘See you later’ (Lit.: ‘Let us see each other later.)’
Unlike all other su#xes related to the domain of command and manipulation,
the su#x -tai can attach to an imperfective stem. This seems a little odd, as the
morpheme -tai seems to be based on the basic immediate future -ta (which is likely also
the source for the imperative). As stated before, the future always takes the aktionsart/
perfective stem, thus the use of an imperfective stem in this case, from a structural point
of view, seems unexpected.
14.4.3.5. Prohibitive -pa
The prohibitive -pa is used with negative commands. It addresses a 2 singular by
default. If a 2 plural person is addressed, then the plural form -rupa is used. The su#x rupa is historically composed of a plural formative *-ru and the prohibitive -pa.
Optionally, speakers can use the su#x -pa followed by the 2 plural subject su#x -rumɨ.
There is no di$erence between using -rupa or -pa-rumɨ. The next examples illustrate the
use of the prohibitive.

CAUS-bathe-LOAF-APPR-PL.PROH‘[With] Very hot [water] do not bathe [her].’
Since the prohibitive typically refers to actions or events that are not desired to
occur, it very frequently occurs following the apprehensive su#x, as can be appreciated
in the above examples.
14.4.4. Apprehensive -ai
The Wampis apprehensive modality is morphologically codi""ed via the use of
the su#x -ai. The apprehensive serves to express that a potential event is seen as highly
undesirable. Following Lichtenberk, it can be said that the Wampis apprehensive
involves a miscellany of epistemic and attitudinal semantics related to the coding of
“the speaker’s degree of certainty about the factual status of a proposition and with his
or her attitude concerning the desirability of the situation encoded in the clause” (1995:
293). The apprehensive in Wampis covers the domains equivalents to what is typically679codi""ed with lest-clauses (Dixon 2002) and évitatifs (François 2003) in other languages.
Unlike the morphemes seen in §14.4.3, the prohibitive occurs with all persons. With the
second person, it occurs with the prohibitive -pa as was seen in the previous section.
Third person does not distinguish between singular and plural. Table 14.10 shows a
paradigm of person marking with the apprehensive.","[714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720]"
