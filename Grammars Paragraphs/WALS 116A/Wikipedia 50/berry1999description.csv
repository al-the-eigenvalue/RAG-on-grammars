"O\MYNQ'v1One of the most striking characteristics of yes/no questions noted by researchers is a
rising-final intonation contour (Sadock & Zwicky 1985: 1 8 1 ). An analysis of the intonation
patterns in Abun yes/no questions reveals the opposite, that is a falling final intonation
contour. The intonation pattern for interrogati ve sentences is the same as that for indicative
sentences. Therefore intonation is not such a significant distinguishing feature of yes/no
questions in Abun as it is in many other languages. Ultan ( 1 978:230) points out that in his
79-language sample, those languages that had prepositions always had a rising terminal1 03MARKED MOODScontour intonation pattern. Abun is clearly an exception to this (see Figures 6. 1 and 6.2 below
which contrast yes/no and confirmative question intonation patterns).
There are three basic systems for short answers to yes/no questions: yes/no,
agree/disagree and echo systems. Abun speakers use a mixture of these systems: an echo
system for positive responses; and a negative particle, nde, for negative responses. They do
not have both positive and negative particles for answering like the English 'yes' and 'no ' ,
but rather they only have the negative particle. When a question such a s that in example 6 . 3 i s
asked, a positive answer would be the echo, 'There is cooked food ' . Frequently such answers
may be shortened even further, a possible response to 6.3 being rna 'there i s ' . A negative
response would require the use of nde 'no ' .","[114, 115]"
"Instead of having a number of varied alternatives, a further possibility is to have just two
alternatives, one being the negation of the other. In these cases the first alternative (which is
positive) is followed by bado, while the second alternative is the negative particle, nde,
followed by the yes/no question marker, e. Thus the structure of a positive-negative
alternative question is:
(te) CLAUSE bado nde e
Example 6 . 1 0 illustrates this type of question.",[117]
"This type of construction could be called a truncated positive-negative alternative question.
The addition of nde e makes the question more forceful and is used in cases where a
question, like that in example 6. 1 1 , is ignored or not answered quickly enough, so the
speaker would reiterate the question with nde e in addition to bado.
A further variation of the type of alternative question is one where the final alternative
seeks information. The final clause follows the same structure as i nformation-seeking
questions, discussed in §6. 1 .4. Example 6 . 1 2 illustrates this type, where the last alternative is
actually an information-seeking question, and uses the particle ne as FQM.",[117]

positive/negative alternative question. It has the same meaning as if nde e was present.",[117]

FQMRegarding intonation in alternative questions, Abun has a falling final intonation contour
on bado in much the same way as intonation falls in yes/no questions as well as indicative
sentences.
No matter what type of alternative question is asked, the syntax is the same, that is the
'Alternative Question Marker' (AQM), bado, fol lows each alternative. The final alternative is
followed by its relevant QM, usually the yes/no question marker, except for cases where it is
one seeking information. The 'Initial Question Marker' (IQM) is optionally present, as for
other question types. The structure of an alternative question (where n + 1 = the number of
alternatives) is:
[(te) CLAUSE bado ] n CLAUSE eCHAPTER 61 06In example 6. 1 3 there are four alternati ves. Each one, except the last, is fol lowed by bado.
This means that the clause which precedes it is in question as a possible alternative and every
clause in an alternative question must be followed by bado. The comma before bado and the
semicolon after it represent a pause and a longer pause respectively.","[117, 118]"
"Confirmative questions not only have a distinct FQM, but are also distinguished from
yes/no questions by a rising final intonation contour. Example 6.7 has the intonation pattern
as shown in Figure 6. 1 , which contrasts with the intonation pattern for the yes/no question of
6.8, shown in Fi gure 6.2 below.",[115]

There are many characteristics that distinguish yes/no questions from other structures in
the world's languages. Characteristics listed by Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985 : 1 8 1 ) in order of
frequency in their sample were: rising final intonation contour, a sentence-initial particle, a
sentence-final particle, special verb morphology and word order. Abun yes/no questions are
marked with an optional sentence-initial particle and an obigatory sentence-final particle.
The structure of a YES/NO question in Abun is:(te) CLAUSE e
The Yes/No Question Marker e is always used in yes/no questions. However, the 'Initial

questions studied, about 35% used te o Examples 6 . 1 and 6.2 illustrate typical yes/no

yes/no questions. Negati vely biased yes/no questions, such as in example 6.6, are
unacceptable to an Abun speaker.",[115]
"8. 1 .2 POSlTIVE-NEGATIVE ALlERNATIVE QUESTIONS
The primary negative particle is also used in asking positive-negative alternative questions.
The structure of this type is:
S PRED badu nde e?
These questions could be called negative tag questions with a positive-negative alternative,
'Do you want to go back to your wife, or not?' , as in example 8 . 5 where a person is being
asked to make a decision between positive and negative alternatives.

"MARKED MOODS113Example 6.44 i s looking for a more specific answer than 6.45. We may get an answer like
com, cassava and tomatoes; whereas the answer to the second question may be something
more general, like vegetables. Often the answer may not be different, but the question in
example 6.45 is more likely to result in a less specific answer.
Suma is limited in its use as an interrogative word to asking questions such as 'what' or
'why ' . However u is more widely used and is involved in periphrasis to form most types of
questions, such as 'who ' , 'whose ' , 'what' , 'which ' , 'where ' , 'why ' , 'how ' and 'when ' .
The third interrogative word, o t 'how many' , is used in forming questions relating to
quantity and time, that is, 'when ' and 'how many' .
6. 1 .4.3 ot QUESTIONS
The interrogative pronumeral ot is used to form questions about time and quantity. There
is some overlap of u and ot in asking time questions. Compare example 6.46 below with
6.39 above. The difference is that in 6.39 the answer would be expected to name a day,
month or other point in time, such as next year; whereas 6.46 would expect an answer such
as 'in five days' or 'three months', that is with some type of numerical response.

FQMThere are no tense markers on verbs in Abun, so whether a time question (such as in
example 6.47) is in the past or future is determined by reference to the context, or by the
special use of the word ete 'then' , (as in 6.46) or be 'later' (as in 6.48) to indicate future
time.

FQMOt is also used in questions of quantity. In this type, ot follows the noun for a specific
item such as 'pigs' or 'money' with its appropriate classifier, as in examples 6.50 and 6.5 1 .
See §3.4. 1 . for a list of classifiers and the types of nouns to which they apply.","[124, 125]"

responses to yes/no questions uses a yes/no system. Raising of the eyebrows means 'yes ' ,
and turning up of their nose means 'no ' .",[115]
"NEDe?
Yl'Q\1Example 8 .6 has the same structure, but differs in meaning. It comes from a text where
the speaker is lecturing another about his relationship with his wife. He is not asking whether
the one addressed thinks about his wife, or not, as in a positive-negative alternative type of
question. Rather, he is using it as a rhetorical question with the meaning, ' You don't think
about your wife' ! The context makes it clear when a negative tag question is being asked or is
being used rhetorically.",[145]
"Information-seeking questions have a final falling intonation contour similar to yes/no and
alternative questions. Such type of intonation is not what would be expected according to the
findings by U1tan ( 1 978:230), where he points out that information questions have a
considerably better-than-chance probability of having a rising terminal contour.
The question word fol lows the constituent that is the focus of interrogation. In example
6. 1 8, the subject, that is 'the person who came ' , is the focus of interrogation; whereas in 6. 1 9
the object, that is 'the types of plants' , i s the focus of interrogation. I n 6.20 the location is the
focus of interrogation, and in 6.21 the indirect object is the focus of interrogation.

Payne ( l 985a:40) also points out that in certain environments the distinction between
'and' and 'or' (when the latter is indifferent in the choice between the elements) may be a
minimal one. For example, in example 5 . 1 74 above, an alternative translation would be, 'Eat
animals such as wild pigs (or), kangaroos (or), tree kangaroos or the like ' . Likewise, there is
some merging of 'and' and 'or' in examples 5 . 1 65 and 5 . 175. On the other hand, examples
5. 1 73 and 5 . 1 85 may not be translated as 'or' , but must only be 'and' .
Juxtaposition is sometimes used as an alternative to bado. It is particularly evident when
quantifiers are used in noun phrases, such as in example 5. 1 9 1 .
5.191rnbre dik y o w e yo
cloth one a two a
one or two clothsOther alternatives to bado, that are frequently used as alternative conjunctions in spoken
Abun, are ke and ka. These come from Biak and Indonesian respectively, the latter being a
corruption of the yes/no question particle, kah. This has come about because bado is used in
asking alternative or tag questions, as in 'An rna, bado, (nde e) ?' 'He has corne or (not)?'
Frequently nde e is omitted, so the alternative conjunction may also act like a yes/no
interrogative particle. Thus Abun speakers have adopted the Indonesian, kah, and use that
just as they use their own, bado; that is, as an alternative conjunction and in alternative
questions, even though in Indonesian kah is only a yes/no question marker and not an
alternative conj unction. The alternative conjunction in Indonesian is atau, which also is
sometimes borrowed by Abun speakers. Examples are:1 00CHAPTER S5 . 1 92Nan kra

Abun has no special form for rhetorical questions. Instead interrogative sentences can be
used in a rhetorical sense; that is, the speaker not only is sure of the answer, but also requires
no answer. So on some occasions, although the structure is interrogative, the illocutionary
force i s not. This is plain in narrative texts where the speaker continues after asking a
'question' because the answer is obvious. Examples taken from text are:

"Interrogative mood, in addition to the question word itself, has two particles that bracket
the clause, te 'INITIAL QUESTION MARKER' , for all types of questions and a final question marker
which is one of:

In an alternative question, two or more possibilities are presented by the speaker.
Combinations include two possibilities such as, 'Do you want to go, or not?' , where the
alternative is a positive or negative reply; or 'Do you want a banana, or a coconut?' , where
the alternative is between two items. Another possibi lity is where one alternative is specified
and the second alternative seeks information such as, ""Is the palm wine sweet, or what?""
Also more extensive lists of alternative items are possible.

questions, and negative equational sentences.",[144]

FQMWith regard to the interrogative proforms used in information-seeking questions, Abun
has only three. According to Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985 : 1 84), theoretically it should be
possible that only one single morpheme, glossed as 'what ' , is needed. Therefore, allCHAPTER 6108information questions would involve periphrasis (that is, 'what person' for who, 'what place'
for where, and so on). However, in practice the smallest system known to them is the
Yokuts system with three interrogative words. Abun can therefore be added as one of the
smallest systems known. The three proforms are :sum awhatgeneral interrogativeuwhichspecific interrogativeothow manypronumeral i nterrogativeTable 6.2 shows each interrogative word and its periphrasis together with the equivalent
question words in English.
Abun is even more unusual than Yokuts, not having a distinct interrogative proform that
makes a distinction between personal and impersonal ( ' who' and 'what' in English). Ultan
( 1 97 8:229) points out that this contrast is almost always present. But instead Abun forms the
pronominal interrogative, 'who ' , by a combination of je 'person ' and u 'which' .
Each interrogative word with examples of various question types i s discussed below.","[119, 120]"

orCHAPTER6MARKED MOODSThere are three moods which are marked in Abun, namely interrogative, i mperative and
frustrated action. Mood is marked by a clause-final particle which fol lows other particles (that
is, those that mark negation, aspect and modality). Each marked mood will be discussed in
tum.6. 1 lNTERROGATIVE MOOD
Interrogative mood, like other moods in Abun, uses particles. Two particles are used to
bracket or delineate the constituent being interrogated. The pattern of bracketing a
grammatical constituent by particles is a feature of the Abun language. It is used in negation
(see §8 .2), and also in relative clauses, both restricted and unrestricted, as discussed in §9.
The basic structure of an interrogative sentence in Abun is:IQM clause FQM
The optional particle te (referred to as IQM 'Initial Question Marker' ) and another particle
called FQM 'Final Question Marker' bracket the clause in question. For all question types te is
the IQM, but the particle FQM varies according to the type of question being asked.
The initial particle te, although now apparently totally optional, may well have been an
obligatory part of interrogative structures in the past, before the influence of the national
language, Indonesian. This is borne out by the fact that those less influenced by the national
language, from interior villages, use te much more than those on the coast, where the effects
of the national language are more prevalent.
As a general rule, the pattern of intonation in interrogative sentences is a final falling
contour. The exception is confirmative questions which have a final rising intonation.
All interrogatives are seeking some type of information. On lexical grounds, namely the
variation in the FQM particle, it is apparent that Abun has four basic types of interrogatives.
The four types are the:
•YES/NO (or NEXUS) question, one that seeks a comment on the truth of a proposition;•CONFIRMATfYE question, that seeks agreement, or confirmation from the addressee;•ALTERNATIVE question, which provides a list of possibilities from which the
addressee selects an answer;•INFORMATION or QUESTION WORD question, which seeks particular information such
as 'who ' , ' what ' , ' how ' , 'why ' , ' when' and 'where ' .","[112, 113]"

�M6.1 .4.4 TOPICAUSATION OF INFORMATION-SEEKlNG QUESTIONS
Information-seeking questions, like indicative sentences, can be topicalised (see §4.7.2). In
these forms the question word is followed by the demonstrative-focus word (or topicaliser),
anato, as in example 6.54. The use of this form brings sukjan 'plants' into greater focus or
emphasis than the non-topicalised forms, as in 6.55 and 6.56.

2SG plant

"The primary particle, nde, is used in all types of negation. Not only is it used as the
primary negation particle, but standing alone it simply means ' no ' . When a question is asked
and the response is negative, a simple nde is sufficient in reply. In contrast, the other negative
particle, yo, is used only in conjunction with nde. So it can be said that nde is indeed the
primary or basic negative particle.
The particle nde is required to form prohibitive sentences, positive-negative alternative
questions and negative equational sentences (§8. 1 ).
The secondary particle yo is used in conjunction with the primary particle in the formation
of the following sentence types: negative indicative sentences, negative information-seeking
interrogati ves, negative descriptive sentences, negative location sentences. It is also used in
the negation of subordinate clauses (§8.2).
Placement of the negative particles when they occur is invariant: yo always precedes the
predicate, while nde always follows the predicate. The following example illustrates negation
of a simple indicative sentence, where both yo and nde are obligatory:

details regarding the distinction between these two see §5.2. 1 . The same form of this
pronoun is used for all persons.

equivalent to a negative sentence. Affirmative answers use an echo system rather than a
prosentence (see §6. 1 for more details).
There are three members of the interrogative proforms subclass, namely u 'which ' ,

fQv1Take note that the interrogative mood also has two bracketing particles, te the initial
question marker and ne the final question marker. The bracketing required to negate a clause
falls within the bracketing required to form an interrogative construction, as seen in example

Questions seeking information, such as those asking 'who ' , 'what ' , 'how ' , 'wh y ' , ' when '
and 'where ' , are all formed in Abun in a similar way. They follow the general bracketing
pattern that is evident in negation. A question of this type is formed by using two particles or
markers: te (always optional) at the start of the sentence and fQ\1 at the end. An interrogative
proform is also used in conjunction with these markers. This is a rare combination according
to Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985 : 1 83), who say that inversion and special morphology
frequently co-occur with interrogative words, whereas particles and contrastive intonation do
not.
The structure of information-seeking interrogative sentences in Abun is:(Ie) S v 0 ADJUNCT (Q) FQM
where FQM is a 'Final Question Marker' and (Q) represents a single interrogative word which
may fol low one of either the subject, the verb, the object or the adj uncts, depending upon
which constituent is being interrogated. Exceptions to this pattern occur when information
seeking-interrogative sentences are topicalised, as in example 6. 14. This pattern is discussed
in detail in §6. 1 .4.4.",[118]

This construction although possible is not common. It is most likely to be used in
response to a question. If a question was asked, 'Which Yan are you talking about?' a reply
such as Yan gato bi im mo Arlince ne ' Yan whose mother is Arlince' is common.
However, this structure within a full sentence is not preferred. Example 9.38 below would
not be acceptable.",[169]

For imperative , the following particles are clause-final: se (Abun Ji) and the dialectal
variant, tom (Abun Tat) STRONG HORTATIVE as in example 4.47; et MIlD HORTATIVE 4.48, and nde
'PROHlBITIVE' 4.49. The unmarked form, 'BASIC IMPERATIVE' 4.50, is distinguished from
indicative mood by context. For further discussion regarding imperative mood see §6.2.","[71, 72]"
"CHAPTER 346The three aspect particles are listed in Table 3 . 1 5 below. For more detail s see §7. 1 .
TABLE 3.15: ASPECI' PARl1CLES
ParticleAspect TypeMeaningreperfectalreadyitcompletivecompletedt6incompletiveyet, stil lThere i s a limited number of particles which some writers refer to as 'modality ' rather
than as aspect (Foley 1 986: 1 5 2ff.). In Abun, three modal particles are used. These are listed
in Table 3 . 1 6 below and are discussed in more detail in §7.2.
TABLE 3. 16: MODAL PARl1CLES
ParticleMeaningModal typebayokprobabi litymaybe, could, probablyyapossibilitymightgoassertiveshould, could really, certainlyIn Abun, the constituent termed mood is an element of the clause expressed through the
means of a clause-final particle. The indicative mood is unmarked. One interesting feature of
the mood particles is the use of two particles as a linked pair to indicate interrogation. In a
simi lar way, negation of indicative sentences uses a linked pair of particles. In Abun, the
strategy of using two particles (as opposed to one) is for the purpose of delineating
constituent boundaries. Thus the constituent 'interrogative' is marked by two particles, one
termed the initial question marker (IQM), occurring clause-initially and the other, the final
question marker (FQM), which ends or closes the interrogative. In modem usage the initial
question marker te appears to be optional, perhaps influenced by the national language,
Indonesian, which does not possess such a particle. The FQM differs according to the type of
interrogati ve.
A table of the eight mood particles is listed below. For further information about mood
particles listed here see §6.","[57, 58]"
"3.4.5 PARTICLES
There are several subclasses of particles including a topicaliser particle, a particle used for
negation, three aspect, three modal and eight mood particles. The term particle is used to
mean a free form word that does not take any type of inflection. It is an invariant form that
never occurs in an environment where i t could be described as 'bound' .
The topicaliser or focus particle is ana(to), which always occurs after the subject and
before the verb. See §4.7.2 for more details about the use of this particle.
There is one negative particle, nde, which occurs after the predicate and before aspect
mood or modal particles. Used on its own it may answer a question in the negative. To form
the indicative negative this particle along with the predicate marker yo form a linked pair of
particles. These particles jointly bracket the constituent 'predicate' . Used in a sentence without
yo, nde makes the mood of the sentence prohibitive. For further details see §8.
If a clause includes aspect, modal or mood particles, those particles will always be in
clause-final position in that order. The particles may occur after either the verb, the object, the
indirect object or an adjunct, depending on the constituents of the particular clause concerned.
Also, these particles are not clitics in that the particle takes equivalent phonological stress
along with every other word in the clause.",[57]

relativise the possessor. In an incomplete or partial sentence, such as an answer to a question
or as a modification of a noun in apposition to a full clause (such as example 9.37) a
relativisation of the possessor is possible. It is possible to relativise the possessor only in
limited circumstances. It is not preferred as part of a complex sentence. This could be said to
confirm that the possessor position is the lowest on the hierarchy.",[169]

Examples 1 1 .27 and 1 1 .28 above show hypothetical situations which could happen at any
future undisclosed time. These hypothetical situations could aptly be translated by
'whenever' . Thus yo, here translated as 'when ' in English, could also be translated as 'if' for
these irrealis sentences. Givon ( 1 990:830) notes that, ""In many languages, irrealis
conditionals are marked identically as irrealis when-clauses, so that the slight difference
between them is inferred from the context."" This is the case for Abun. Examples 1 1 .30 and
1 1 .3 1 below are irrealis conditional sentences and are marked by yo to express the
conditional relationship between the clauses.

FUr
B ut if the young men haven't seen anything, (then) they order. ..orderIt was stated earlier that Abun has no single lexical item to represent a conditional
relationship between clauses. The tensed conjunctions sa and yo can be used to express this
relationship but often no conjunction will be used at all. In the following example the first
clause expresses a current state so that the time setting is neither past nor future. Here neither
sa nor yo have been used to link the two clauses. There is no l inker at all . The two clauses are
juxtaposed and the conditional relationship that is expressed is inferred by the hearer from the
known context.

The conjunction yo is also used to link other clauses that could be described as
' hypothetical alternatives' . Abun has no single lexical item that represents alternation such as
the English 'or' . In questions often bado 'ALTERNATIVE QUESTION MARKER' is used. In a complex
sentence involving several alternatives yo may be used where the situation is not fully known
and therefore hypothetical in some way. In such instances yo is best translated as 'whether' .

"1 27ASPECTAND MODAliTYAn Abun speaker may also simply say, An ma 'He camelis comi ng ' , which does not
emphasise either the persistence of the result (that is, that he is still there) or the finality of his
coming. Normally, when a group of people are waiting for a particular person to arrive, and
then someone sees him coming, they would announce the arrival, as in example 7 .20b,
because the finality of the action is of importance to the hearers.
In a language like Abun which does not use specific tense markers, these two aspect
markers have a close relationship with past time, especially in the absence of any contextual
indications of time reference, such as a temporal adverbial. Likewise, when aspect is
unmarked there is a close relationship with present time. Comrie ( 1 976:83) makes similar
comments regarding the role of aspect in languages without tense markers.
In answer to a question like that in example 7 . l 3 above, one may answer including either
of the aspect markers, re or t6. The actual answer given by the speaker was:
7.2 1Anki""Nde reodoAnbinggon3sG say COM
NEG
PERF 3sG PERF wife
He said, ""No. His wife does not yet know"".jamnde to. ""
INCAMknow NEGHe wanted to emphasise two aspects here. Firstly, his wife did not know and this 'not
knowing' persisted (nde re) and secondly, she did not yet know and this 'not knowing' still
continued, or, in other words, the 'knowing' was not yet completed (nde t6).
According to Comrie ( 1 976:24), languages may combine several aspects where they are
compatible and there are formal means to do so. Abun speakers may follow t6 with re, as
seen in example 7.22, but no evidence has been found of re followed by t6 or combinations
of t6 and it, or re and it.

3SG NEGmande to

PERF7.2 MODALITY
Modality has been defined by Lyons ( 1 977:452) as the attitude or opinion of the speaker
towards the proposition that the sentence expresses, or the situation that the proposition
describes. Lyons considers modality to be a parenthetical sentence-adverb that expresses
speakers' attitudes such as certainty, necessity, possibility, and doubt. In Abun, a
syntactically distinct closed class of words expresses a speaker' s attitude in some of these
ways. The modals and their types are listed in Table 7.2 below:TABLE 7.2: MODAL PARllCLES
ParticleMeaningModal Typeyapossibilitymightbayokprobabilitymaybe, could, probablygoassertiveshould, could really, will certainlyCHAPTER 7128These particles are part of the cluster of clause-final particles. They are optional and occur
following any negative and aspect particles, and preceding any mood particles.
Simi lar to aspect, modality does not relate to the timing of the event or proposition about
which the speaker expresses an attitude. Each modality type, therefore, can be used in
sentences that are understood to be in the past or future.","[138, 139, 140]"
"MARKED MOODS1 07The final question marker (FQM) is either ne or o. The use of either one of these particles is
obligatory. The particles ne and 0 are used interchangeably, with no change in meaning. So
example 6. 16a has the same meaning as 6 . 1 6b. These two particles appear to have been
originally dialectal variants which have now been incorporated into all dialects. There is no
apparent difference in meaning; ne is more common than 0, occurring in 90% of all
questions analysed.
6 . 1 6 a. Nan jan
suma ne ?
2SG plant what fQM
What did you plant?
b. Nan jan
suma o ?
2SG plant what fQM
What did you plant?
Both particles (te . . . ne/o) bracket the whole sentence irrespective of its complexity. In a
complex sentence as in example 6. 1 7, two clauses are embedded: a relative clause and a
dependent purpose clause. Both are bracketed by the initial and final particles.

"5.7.2 DISJUNCTION
According to Payne ( 1 985a:40), the majority of languages appear to possess at least one
unequivocal strategy for disjunction, and this is invariably permitted at sentential and phrasal
levels. This is true in Abun. The basic structure for disjunction is for the speaker to fol low
each phrase or sentence with the word, bado. In Abun, disjunct phrases consist of: NP bado NP
bado and so on. The form bado is the alternative conjunction.
Examples of the use of bado from sentence to phrase level are:
(i) Sentence:
5 . 1 86Pa

(v) where, from where, which direction
For questions regarding location, source or direction the appropriate preposition is used
together with u. So for location, mo u means 'where' in example 6.35; source, kagit u 'from
where' as in 6.36 and direction, ket u 'which direction' as in 6.37.

28An alternative analysis is that these are treated as serial verbs.
It could be stated that the fact that subjectless constituents do not exist elsewhere in the language
does not in itself represent an argument that they do not exist in the constructions shown here. It
needs to be pointed out that in Abun there is not sufficient syntactic evidence to posit that a
subjectless subordinate clause exists as a real constituent in the language, either in these cases or
anywhere else. The only reason for positing that such a constituent may exist here is not due to
syntactic evidence but rather to accommodate a certain theoretical position. In order to master a
second language properly the language learner must not only master vocabulary but also master the
syntactic patterns that are found in the language. In order to speak Abun effectively it is not
necessary to include in one's inventory of syntactic patterns a reduced clause of this kind. It seems
strange to add to the list of Abun clause types a reduced clause which does not have any specific
syntactic marking to indicate its separate existence. This raises the question of whether certain
clause types should be added to the language' s inventory when the only basis for doing so is
theoretical rather than observed syntactic evidence.",[196]
"185COMPLEMENf ClAUSESThere is one other means o f syntactic evidence to indicate that only one constituent, a
complement clause which functions as object, follows these predicate types. It is possible to
restructure some of these sentences so they can be stated as cleft sentences. For example
10.63 repeated here as 1 0.7 1 can be restructured to approximate a cleft sentence.
1 0.7 1Ani-wajisian rnu rno nggwe.3sG be.happy-TRs l sG with 3sG go to

be.happY-TRS FOC
l SG with 3SGthing-sPEC 3sG
What she wanted was that I go with her to the garden.rnu rno nggwe.
go togardenLater in § 1 2.6 these types of constructions will be discussed further. However it is clear
from example 10.72 that, while Abun does not have a passive construction through which
the object can be identified, the means of focus that is possible by the noun modifier anato
serves the same function. If the question 'What was it that she wanted?' was asked the
answer would be as in 1 0.72. The object of the predicate i-wa is clearly located after the
focus particle anato and it is obviously the entire clause. Therefore it is preferable to analyse
these complement clauses as the object of the main clause rather than positing the alternative
structure discussed here.
Noonan ( 1 985: 1 33) makes the claim that ""All languages have an s-like indicative
complement type, and all languages have some sort of reduced complement type in
opposition to the indicative"". In comparing languages he posits a minimum of these two
complement types which constitute the smallest kind of complement system that is found in
the world's languages. According to his definition, Abun has only one complement type, not
two, since all Abun complement clauses are indicative clauses. However, we would like to
suggest that Abun does have two complement types-those with complementisers and those
without (in this work termed 'embedded' ). The basis for these distinctions is not found
within the complement clause itself. This has been the basis on which Noonan and others
have made their division of complement types. This basis has come from the alteration in
structure of the complex sentence of which the complement is a part. External rather than
internal considerations have been the basis for the division of Abun complement types. In
this way Abun is different in its complement structure to other languages that have been
described.","[196, 197]"

There are several interjections in Abun, such as mban! 'expression of surprise/alarm' (for
example, when a coconut falls nearby); mara! 'expression of disgust' (for example, when
someone doubts the integrity of another person, this interjection would begin a defence); and
bei! 'expression of surprise ' . According to Schachter ( 1 985: 58), ""The class of interjections
often includes words which are phonologically distinctive"". However, in contrast to this,
those interjections observed so far fit within the regular phonological patterns of the language.","[58, 59]"
