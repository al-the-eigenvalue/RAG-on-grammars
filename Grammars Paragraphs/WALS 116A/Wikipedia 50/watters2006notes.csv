"Adverbs of mannerTwo adverbs of manner that are generic are based on ‘this’ and ‘that’ and combine
with the ‘make’ verb root to form pro-forms – ‘in this manner,’ and ‘in that manner’:
(216)a. ai ˙di
b. gin ˙di‘doing like this’
‘doing like that’Other adverbs of manner have to do with the relative speed in which an event occurs,
as in the following:
(217)a. m˙st˙m˙
b. m˙la≥
c. siba‘slowly’
‘tardily’
‘fast, quickly’Others adverbs refer to the associative aspect of the referents performing the action:
(218)a. myaqa
b. qa tse‘alone’
‘together’Still others adverbs of manner answer questions about an event’s level of certainty
or necessity, and if the event did not occur, about the margin of possibility by which it
failed to occur, as in:
(219)5.6.2.a. REALIS:
k˙pæera‘again’b. IRREALIS:
hunko‘almost’Adverbs of timeAdverbs of time are broader in scope that manner adverbs, and characterize entire
events, as in: Yesterday, Prem Bahadur went to the forest. In the following examples,
we list them in broad semantic domains, though it must be pointed out that the different

in: Kamala sat across from me. Locative suffixes also specify location or direction, as
in ‘in the tree’ or ‘to the house’ and were treated in §5.2.2.3. Those listed here are
locative postpositions. Locative postpositions were treated more generally in §5.3 as a
class of nouns – “relator nouns” – and will not be repeated here.
We will add here two other adverbs – adverbs of relative distance – that are somewhat
different from physical location:

"HortativeOur understanding of the hortative in Kusunda is still tentative. Part of the problem
is due to a close similarity in form between hortatives and first person past forms. In
Class I verbs, i.e. those with prefixed person marking, there is generally a defective or
poorly developed past perfective marking (sometimes missing altogether). Recall from
examples like (163–165) that past marking is characterized by -d-i ‘first person,’ -n-i
‘second person,’ and -g-i ‘third person.’ In verbs without the past distinction (some of
the Class I verbs) there is only a realis–irrealis distinction. It is in precisely these cases
that -di marks hortative, not first person past.
Thus, with a Class I verb like ‘eat,’ realis and irrealis forms occur predictably as
follows, paralleling the forms for ‘beat’:
(207)Class I - EATClass II - BEATREALIS:a. t-˙m-˙n

‘They beat.’Forms -di and -d˙i (209a–b) mark the hortative in Class I, but past tense in Class II.
Furthermore, the forms expected in (209c–f) are generally missing from Class I, though
there appears to be some confusion on that count. Gyani Maiya and Kamala are in
disagreement on whether a form n-˙m-di is possible – Gyani Maiya says “yes” (as a
past tense); Kamala says “no”. The analogy between Class I hortative and Class II
past tense apparently confuses them. Though the forms n-˙m-di and g-˙m-di have a
familiar ring to them, they are unsure about their grammaticality and where to place
them.
A question arises as to how the hortative is marked in Class II verbs. Unfortunately,
our notes are sketchy and inconsistent on this matter and we cannot give a definitive
answer. For some verbs we have homophonous forms for the hortative and first person
past:
(210)a.
b.
c.
d.a-d-i
e-d-i
dzaÚ-d-i
tsim˙-d-i‘I made it.’ / ‘Let me make it!’
‘I gave it.’ / ‘Let me give it!’
‘I bought it.’ / ‘Let me buy it!’
‘I touched it.’ / ‘Let me touch it!’For other verbs we have the homophonous form plus a disambiguated form that
makes use of the Class I hortative form of the verb ‘get, go get, fetch’:
(211)a. pumba-di / -d-i
beat-HORT / -1-PAST‘Let me beat it!’ / ‘I beat it.’b. pumba ts-i-di
1-get-HORT
beat‘Let me (go/get) beat it!’The grammaticalization of a hortative from verbs like ‘come,’ ‘go,’ and ‘get’ is not
unusual and has been reported in numerous languages (see Aikhenvald forthcoming: on
80Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Origins of imperatives). What is unusual is a formal similarity between past tense and
hortative. In the languages surrounding Kusunda, and following universal expectations,
the hortative has formal ties to future tense.
5.5.7.2.","[79, 80, 81]"
"Interrogative pronounsThe interrogative pronouns of Kusunda correspond to the so-called WH-words of
English and include the following seven:
(100)a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.n˙ti
n˙n
n˙tßn
hampe
˙sa
˙si
˙saÚ i‘who, what’
‘what, why’
‘what, why’
‘where’
‘how’
‘how much’
‘when’The semantic domain of some of these interrogatives is not yet clear. ‘What,’ for
example, can be expressed by n˙ti, n˙n, or n˙tßn, all obviously related forms, but it is not
clear what their semantic differences are.1 9 Used with an animate demonstrative, n˙ti is
17The basic form for this word is mihaq ~ mehaq, and it is not clear to us what the function of
the prefix ge- might be.
B. K. Rana (2002) claims similarity between this word and the Kham word ge-pa≥ ‘our
language.’ Granted, p˙n and pa≥ bear some similarity, the initial element in Kham is a first person
plural prefix, while in Kusunda it is a third person singular.
1847Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
translated by ‘who,’ and with an inanimate demonstrative, by ‘what,’ as in the following
(see §5.1.3):
(101)a. n˙ti na
who this (animate)‘Who is this?’b. n˙ti ta
what this (inanimate)‘What is this?’Likewise, n˙tßn, which usually means ‘what’ can also mean ‘why,’ as in:
(102)gæ˙run n˙tßn n-˙m-˙o,
kæ˙≥gu qwon
drink:IMP
hot
why 2-eat-NEG:IRR, cold
‘Why won’t you drink it hot? (Then) drink it cold!’The possessive ‘whose’ is expressed with the interrogative pronoun n˙ti, plus the
genitive suffix, as in:
(103)gina k˙l˙m n˙ti-ye
that pen
who-GEN
‘That pen is whose?’The forms in (100e–g) are obviously related, all beginning with ˙s. The semantic
relation between ‘how much’ and ‘when’ seems plausible, but a semantic relation
between ‘how’ and ‘how much’ seems odd, although it occurs also in English.
• Negative indefinite pronouns. Negative indefinite pronouns are derived from the
more basic interrogative pronouns seen in the preceding section. The “nobody, nothing,
nowhere” series, for example, uses the interrogative pronoun plus an existential negative.
The pattern is pervasive in South Asia and often appears with an emphatic marker on the
question word as well, as in IA Nepali ke-hi chhaina [what-EMP is.not] ‘nothing,’ or TB
Kham su-z˙ male [who- EMP is.not] ‘no one.’ Though it occurs without an emphatic in
Kusunda, its basic form is the same, as the following examples show:
(104)a. n˙tßn kæaÚ u tsim˙n-gya
what not
touch-OPT
‘Nothing will happen, let him touch it!’
b. n˙tßn qæaiya kæaÚ u
what danger not
‘There is no danger.’
c. n˙ti kæaÚ i
who not
‘no one’
d. hampe kæaÚ u

‘nowhere’The finals -ti and -ßn may be old classifier morphemes and occur in other sequences like qas-ti
‘one’ and qas-ßn ‘one’.

"The labial seriesThe labial series in Kusunda is fairly simple and straightforward. There are five
sounds to which we have accorded phonological status – [p], [pæ], [b], [bæ], and [m]
(plus the semivowel [w]).
However, many of the allophonic problems that occur elsewhere in the phonology
also occur in the labial series, and we will do well to deal with them here. One problem
has to do with voicing, another with aspiration, and still another with fricativization.
Though there is a clear voicing contrast word initially, the contrast is sometimes neutralized
intervocalically (especially in rapid speech and if the syllable in question is unstressed),
as in the following examples:
(37)CONTRAST (p- vs. b-):a. [pitadi]
b. [bi itßn]
(38)‘I untied it.’
‘It dawned.’NEUTRALIZATION:a. [tap]
b. [tab-i gwa]‘chicken’
‘chicken egg’Neutralization does not occur if the preceding sound is a consonant, even if it is a
voiced consonant, as in:
(39)a. [amba]
b. [hampe]‘meat’
‘where’

4.4.1.1.","[32, 33]"
"Bilabial fricativesVoiced labial consonants often undergo fricativization when occurring between vowels.
The fricative variants do not have phonemic status. Following are examples:
(40)FRICATIVIZATION:a. [d˙∏˙ i]
b. [yi∏iu]‘later today’
‘scratch’A question arises with respect to polysyllabic morphemes in which a voiced bilabial
stop occurs intervocalically in some words and a voiced fricative in others, as in:
(41)a. [sabe]
b. [ i∏a]‘there’
‘quickly’Without the information in (40) or in (41b), conventional wisdom would recommend
that we write [sabe] as /sabe/. If, however, we can show that underlying /p/ surfaces as
[b] intervocalically and underlying /b/ surfaces as [∏], we would be supported in representing (41a) ‘there’ as /sape/ and (41b) ‘quickly’ as /siba/. We suspect, in fact, that
this is what is happening, but we do not yet have sufficient evidence to support our
hypothesis.
There is a possibility too that some intervocalic sequences that we have represented
as /w/, may, in fact, turn out to be [∏], (i.e. underlying /b/), as in: [d˙∏˙ i] ~ [d˙o i]
‘later.’
4.4.1.2.",[33]
"Word classesThe major word classes, noun, verb, and adjective are well represented in Kusunda.
We will deal with them one at a time in this section with a separate sub-section for
pronouns. We will also look at some minor word classes, like adverbs, numerals, and
question words. We were unable to determine the extent to which Kusunda makes use
of “ideophones” or “rhyming couplets” for modifying verbs. This is a category of
the type in which basic verbs like ‘go’ are modified by ideophonic adverbs to mean
things like ‘saunter,’ ‘stomp away,’ ‘go in long strides,’ etc. The phonomenon is well
represented in the region, both in Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman languages. The
category needs study in Kusunda; indeed, it has not yet been determined if it exists at
all.
5.1.",[44]
"Possessive prefixesIn first and second persons singular, the same pronominal roots (tsi- and ni-) can
occur as pronominal prefixes on nouns, without the genitive. Where they do, they are
possessive prefixes, and differ from the possessive pronouns shown in (90) in much the
same way that ‘mine’ differs from ‘my’ in English. The “alienable–inalienable”
distinction found in some languages appears to be irrelevant for Kusunda. Following
are examples:
(91)a. tsi-gimi
1SPOSS-money‘my money’b. ni-gimi
2SPOSS-money‘your money’
45Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
In first and second persons plural, the possessive root cannot occur as a possessive
prefix attached directly to nouns, but must be accompanied by the genitive. This is true
also for third person gina, as in:
(92)a. *tig-gimi
gimi
1PPOSS-GEN moneyb. tig-i
(93)‘our money’a. *gina-gimi
b. gina-yi gimi
he-GEN money‘his money’First or second person singular possession can be marked by either form – the
prefixal form or the genitive marked form – though there are likely pragmatic differences
between the two. The following examples show them in free variation:
(94)a. tsi-gimi ~ tsi-yi gimi
b. ni-gimi ~ ni-yi gimi‘my money’
‘your money’The genitive occurs also on question words, as in:
(95)
5.1.1.2.n˙ti-ye
who-GENgimi
money‘whose money?’Lexicalized third person possessionThere are several lexical items in the language in which an initial g- is very likely the
vestige of an old third person possessive prefix. Typically, such words come from the
domain of body parts (and may be restricted to a general “parts” domain). Thus, for
example, the default word for ‘stomach’ is gim˙t and the second person possessed
form, ‘your stomach,’ is ni-gim˙t. From this we might expect tsi-gim˙t for ‘my stomach,’
which, indeed is possible, but the preferred form is ts-im˙t.
(96)a. gim˙t
b. ni-gim˙t
c. ts-im˙t‘stomach’
‘your stomach’
‘my stomach’Interestingly, in Reinhard’s 1976 list, ‘stomach’ is listed as imat, without a prefix.
In contrast, ‘knee’ in Reinhard’s list is t-uputu with a prefix (likely meaning ‘my
knee’), while we have elicited upto.
The word for ‘wind’ is qai, while the word for ‘breath’ is either ata qai ‘mouth
wind,’ or ge-qai ‘its wind.’
(97)a. qai
b. ata qai
c. ge-qai, [gya-qai]‘wind’
‘breath’ (lit. ‘mouth wind’)
‘breath’ (lit. ‘its wind’)A word that commonly occurs in combination with other words to mean something
like ‘fluid’ or ‘juice,’ is very likely the etymon for ‘water’ with a lexicalized third
person prefix, as in the following:
(98)a. ta≥
b. gida≥
c. ata gida≥‘water’
‘sap’ (lit. ‘its water’)

(256)tsi t -a -an
I 1-go-IRR
‘I’ll go.’ (I’m volunteering)
‘I’ll go.’ (That’s what I’ll do)In general, however, more topical elements occur early and less topical ones later.
(The order in (256), then, is also a basic, unmarked order.) This is relevant to clauses
that have peripheral elements like time or location. Peripheral elements tend to attract the
focus of assertion. Thus, in (257a–c) the peripheral elements, time, place, and comitative,
occur closer to the verb than the pronominal referent. This is the least marked order:
(257)a. tsi pyana
ts-˙g-˙n

‘I went yesterday.’
b. tsi da≥

‘I will go to Dang.’
c. gina
tok-ma
u-g-i
he/she us-WITH come-3-PAST
‘He/she came with us.’Where both peripheral elements occur – time and location – the element with closer
semantic ties to the verb occurs next to the verb, and the other element occurs as an
adverbial specification to the whole predication. This order mirrors the basic order for
transitive predications too – the object occurs next to the verb, and temporal elements
which occur outside the case frame also occur syntactically outside:
(258)a. INTRANSITIVE:
goraq
tsi da≥
t -a -an

‘Tomorrow I will go to Dang.’
b. TRANSITIVE:

‘Yesterday I beat the dog.’• Case marking. Case marking in Kusunda follows a basic nominative–accusative
alignment – S and A arguments are unmarked (nominative) and the O argument is
marked by the accusative suffix -da (see example (258b)). For more details and
examples, see §5.2.2.2.
There are a few transitive verbs in Kusunda which appear to be “less-than-transitive”
– they have some of the morphosyntactic characteristics of intransitive verbs. ‘Climb,’
‘beg,’ and ‘fight,’ for example, all take intransitive imperative markers. All happen to be
non-accusative in case marking; that is, the notional object is marked by a locative ‘on’
for ‘climb’ and a comitative ‘with’ for ‘beg’ and ‘fight’. (See the discussion following
example (196).)967.","[95, 96, 97]"
"Optative• Optative in Class I verbs. The optative, especially in Class I verbs, has a paradigmatic
relationship to the imperative. The negative imperative (the prohibitive), for example,
employs the second person prefix n-, whereas the optative (either the negative, positive,
or both) employs the third person prefix g-. Apart from this simple generalization, the
paradigm is very irregular. Following are examples:

conjugational patterns. Class II verbs, mostly transitive, are the ones that diverge.
There are also negative optatives in our data set (as in ‘Let him not go’), but
generally they are so confused and incomplete that we will not attempt to present them
here, except to say that some of them appear to take the prohibitive suffix -in, and others
the irrealis negative suffix -wa:

Our data is insufficient to make any predictions, but it is interesting to note that
negative -wa occurs only in the absence of third person g-. Wherever g- occurs, the
negative suffix used is the prohibitive -in.
• Optative in Class II verbs. The most regular optative forms are those for Class II
transitive verbs, i.e. those patterned after the verb ‘to do, make.’ Recall that such verbs
were also very regular in the imperative, empoying the suffix ˙-go ‘Do it!’ / ‘Make it!’
(see examples in (198)). Here the suffix empoyed is -˙ge, fashioned after the optative
form of ‘do’: ˙-ge ‘May he do it!’ Following are examples:

‘to be, to become,’ as in: ˙-gya ‘Let it be!’ The form occurs erratically on other
intransitive verbs as well, which might suggest that this is an intransitive form. Among
them are lim-gya ‘Let him dance!’; b˙l-gya ‘Let him descend!’; sip-gya ‘Let him
enter!’; and dziu-gya ‘Let it leak!’ Significantly, however, the form occurs just as
frequently on transitive verbs, as in kis˙-gya ‘Let him cut it!’; and tsim˙n-gya ‘Let him
touch it!.’ Are we dealing here with a transcription error, with ˙gya being the same form
as ˙ge? Probably not.
Interestingly, the form, wherever it occurs, is almost always transcribed without the
intervening schwa: -gya, but not ˙-gya. Given further that the optative form of the verb
‘to go’ is g-ya, with g- being separable as a third person prefix (which, as we saw
earlier, occurs in the optative form of all Class I verbs; see (212)), it is probable that we
are looking at a grammaticalized verb ‘go’ tacked on as a suffix as in: hui-gya ‘Let it
go fly!’; m˙b˙-gya ‘Let him go hear!’3 0 (We also saw in (211b) that ‘go/get’ is used
as a basis for some hortative constructions.)
Assuming that our analysis is correct, and that -gya is a ‘go’ optative, we are left
with a residue of intransitive verbs that form the optative with the suffix -ta (allomorphs
-da and -na), or -ya. This is analogous to the intransitive imperative formed by the
suffix -to (allomorphs -do and -no in the same environments as optative -da and -na)
and fits our analysis well. Following are examples:

have in common that they modify events or states (i.e. verbs or adjectives). The more
traditional ones are relatable to question words like ‘how,’ ‘where,’ ‘when,’ and ‘how
many’ as adverbs of ‘manner,’ ‘place,’ ‘time,’ and ‘quantity’ respectively, and will be
organized as such here.
It is possible, even likely, that the source for the transitive Class II opatative -˙ge, too, is based
on the optative form of ‘go.’
In our current data set we do not have hui-da ‘Let it fly!’ or m˙b˙ ˙ge ‘Let him hear!’ If we could
confirm these kinds of forms our analysis would be on safer ground.

pronounced ora- and is an example of a verb developing what may someday become a
suppletive pair whose developmental pathway is opaque – -o) ‘die’ versus ora- ‘kill.’
For Class II intransitive verbs there is no shift from prefixing to suffixing under
causativization – they begin with suffixed person marking. Such verbs can be made
transitive either by the morphological causative -a or by the morphological causative -da.
The choice of one over the other does not seem to be based on phonological factors or
the syllable type of the root. The verbs ‘sleep’ and ‘die’ both end in consonants and
the causative is formed by -da. But so also do ‘fall’ and ‘wear’ end in consonants, but
the causative is formed by -a (though -da is also possible with no apparent difference in
meaning, though, of course, there may be a difference in “force” for “directness” of
causation). ‘Scorch’ and ‘swell’ end in vowels, but both form the causative by -da.
There is a great deal of variation between the two forms. Following are verbs which can
take either form:

in the root morpheme itself. The pair ‘to survive’ versus ‘to rescue’ is one such pair
(from ˙igi- to ˙gi-):
(264)a. ˙igi-d-ßn
live-1-REAL‘I survived.’b. ˙gi-da-d-ßn
live-CAUS-1-REAL‘I rescued (him).’Some intransitives when causativized yield unexpected meanings. Two examples are
the verbs ‘to laugh’ and ‘to say.’ Causativized by the morphological causative they do
not mean ‘make laugh’ or ‘make say,’ but rather ‘laugh at’ and ‘say to.’ (Similar
semantic shifts occur in Nepali, suggesting the possibility of contact induced meanings.)

‘No matter what I say to him, he cries.’It should also be noted that morphological causativization in Kusunda works even
on intransitive “process” verbs which would normally require a periphrastic causative
in English – verbs like ‘rot.’ The implication is that the subject is ultimately responsible
for the eventuality, even if only by neglect or inadvertence. Such causatives are typologically
common in the area, in both TB and IA languages:

intransitive and middle senses. In such verbs the “middle” or “anti-causative” <AC> is
marked by the suffix -q. The ‘break’ verbs are among them, as in the following sets of
contrastive pairs:99Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Transitivity alternations

isAnti-causative -q versus lexical -qSomewhat problematic are intransitive verb roots in which a final -q is part of the
underived lexical representation. On the surface, such verb roots look like derived
middles, but, in fact, there are no corresponding transitives without the -q. In such cases,
-q is not a derivational marker per se. Rather, the marker is semantically motivated,
occurring on verbs whose inherent status is middle. We will not separate the -q in these
cases, but treat it as part of the underlying root. (If we do find occasion to dissect such
forms, we will mark them as “middle marked” <MM>, recognizing that we are not
dealing with a derivation.) Under causativization, the middle marking remains (often
becoming -)), followed by the morphological causative -a, as in the following:
(270)a. wi

‘The house collapsed.’
b. tsi wi

It is important to notice the contrast between verbs whose underlying root ends in -q
and verbs whose underlying root is an open syllable. In the former case, -q (or -))
occurs in both transitive and intransitive forms, whereas in the latter case -q occurs only
in the intransitive. Thus, in (272) -q is lexical and the transitive form is derived, and in
(273) -q is derivational and the intransitive form is derived:

Another verb with lexical -q in the intransitive member is soq- ‘climb,’ as in:

‘I climbed.’
b. yi-g˙
soq-a-d-ßn
tree-IN climb-CAUS-1-REAL
‘I treed him.’7.2.2Anti-causative -tMore difficult to interpret are intransitive verb roots which end in -t. Recall that in
many transitive verb conjugations (like a-t-ßn ‘I made’), -t followed by syllabic -ßn signifies
first person followed by realis. There are numerous intransitive verbs, however, in which
a stem final -t followed by syllabic -ßn does not indicate first person:
(275)a. dimi
n~odze gwi-t-ßn
smoke above gather-<T>-REAL
‘Smoke (soot) gathered above.’
b. gag˙ri-ga ta≥
pæiru-t-ßn
water fill-<T>-REAL
jug-LOC
‘Water filled in the jug.’We have glossed -t in (275a–b) with a tentative <T>. The question is, “Is -t part of
the lexical root or is it a grammatical morpheme?” We know already that -t here is not
101Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Transitivity alternations
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
first person. Following the same line of reasoning we used above, we need to compare
these forms with their causativized counterparts:
(276)a. tsi d˙idzi
gwi-˙-d-i
I firewood gather-CAUS-1-PAST
‘I gathered firewood.’
b. gag˙ri-ga ta≥
pæir-a-t-ßn
water fill-CAUS-1-REAL
jug-LOC
‘I filled water in the jug.’The stem final -t does not occur in the causativized version (*gwi-t-a-t-ßn) and we are
left to conclude that -t is an anti-causative morpheme analogous to the -q we saw earlier.
It turns out, in fact, that we have no verbs in our corpus with root final -t. Where -t
occurs it is always anti-causative <AC>.
In §5.5.1.2 (subsection intransitive patterns) we saw that Class II intransitive verbs
have the option of including a person marker immediately after the root-final consonant:
(277)a. sip-ts-in
enter-1-REAL‘I entered.’b. b˙l-n-in
descend-2-REAL‘You descended.’c. pæep-ts-in
fall-1-REAL‘I fell.’d. hyoq-n-in
hide-2-REAL‘You hid.’Significantly, where the same optional person marking is employed in intransitive
verbs with anti-causative -t, the -t occurs after person marking, separating the -t from the
verb root. This strengthens our hypothesis that -t is not part of the intransitive root:
(278)a. nok
gwi-ni-t-n-a-n
you[pl] gather-2-AC-2-PL-REAL
‘You all gathered.’
b. hampe t -a -an kæai-tsi-t-ßn

‘Wherever I go I get scared.’
c. un-da
ts-˙g-˙n
miÚ-tsi-t-ßn
road-LOC 1-go-REAL lost-1-AC-REAL
‘Going along the road I got lost.’We have numerous other examples, too, of “floating” -t in our data base, but we
will not list them all here.
It would, of course, be satisfying to our claims if anti-causative -q also floated to the
right of person markers, thus demonstrating that it too is an element divisible from the
verb root. In fact we have no data in our corpus to prove this. (Nor do we have
anything to disprove it.) We have examples of person marking only on verbs in which
-q is part of the root, and as our claims would predict, -q remains attached to the root, as
in: borloq-tsi-n ‘I got boiled,’ and gyaq-tsi-n ‘I collapsed.’

7.2.3PassiveThere is no canonical passive in Kusunda (of the English sort) in which the former
object is promoted to subject status. The closest analogue is the detransitivizing, anticausative derivation discussed in §7.2 which produces a kind of “middle.” The derivation,
however, appears to be available only to select transitive verbs.
Another structure which is not well understood applies to transitive and intransitive
verbs alike. On Class II transitive verbs, the “auxiliary” ending ‘to do, make,’ is
replaced by a sequence -in-dzi. -Dzi occurs elsewhere as a “present tense” marker
(also not well understood; see example (265b)). The first affix, -in, resembles the
Nepali passive marker -in, but the resemblance may be accidental. It might be equally
plausible to think of -in as the intransitive (inchoative) version of ‘to do, make’ (see
(244b)). We will label it as <INCHO> for “inchoative.” Following are examples of its
usage (but with no attempted explanation on how the construction works)3 2:
(279)a. ACCOMPANIED BY AN ANTI-CAUSATIVE:
dza h~oÚ-˙-go
borlo-q-in-dzi
fire burn-CAUS-IMP boil-AC-INCHO-TAM (?)
‘Stoke the fire, it (the water) will boil.’
b. WITHOUT ANTI-CAUSATIVE:
qai
u-g-i
ip˙n sola-in-dzi
wind come-3-PAST corn break-INCHO-TAM (?)
‘Wind comes and the corn breaks.’
c. ON AN INTRANSITIVE:
n˙n gip˙n ts-o -da-d-ßn
dzæ˙m-in-dzi
what word 1-say-CAUS-1-REAL weep-INCHO-TAM (?)
‘Whatever I say to him, he cries.’Note that (279a) is made intranstive by virtue of the <AC> marker -q, and (279c) is
intransitive already. (279b) begins as a transitive verb, and appears to be detransitivized
by the inchoative -in.
We have several examples of intransitive verbs marked by this construction, but are
uncertain about how the meaning differs from ordinary intransitive conjugation without
-in: kæai-in-dzi ‘He is afraid’; meÚ-in-dzi ‘He gets lost’; dæ~u-in-dzi ‘He stands, rises’;
by~o-in-dzi ‘He sits, squats.’
7.2.3.1“Passive” in ambi-transitive verbsIt is difficult to say unequivocally whether some verbs are inherently transitive or
intransitive. They can be conjugated as transitive or intransitive without mediating
derivational morphology, and the intransitive version is passive-like. The verb ‘to burn,
roast’ is one such verb, as in the following contrastive pair:32My anonymous reviewer has suggested that because the -in- marker in all the examples listed
occurs on the second clause of a complex sentence, it might indicate that the second clause event is a
consequence of the first clause event. The suggestion warrants looking into.","[97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"
"Equative clausesThe equative clause is most commonly expressed without a copula (though, as we
shall see, an infrequently used equative copula does exist). The construction is formed
by the juxtaposition of two noun phrases (NPs) without grammatical case marking. The
first NP in the sequence is the copula subject and the final NP is the copula complement.
The order of the elements has grammatical implications – the subject is the presupposed,
topical element, and the complement functions as the predicator, as in the following:
(226)a. n˙ti na
what this
‘What is this?’
b. na gimi
tsi-yi
this money I-GEN
‘This money is mine.’
c. gina k˙l˙m n˙ti-ye
that pen
who-GEN
‘That pen is whose?’
d. na tsi kila-d-ßn
gimi
this I
steal-1-REAL money
‘This is money that I stole.’
e. nu m˙b˙-n-i
gip˙n n˙tßn
what
you hear-2-PAST talk
‘What is the matter/talk you heard?’A reordering of elements in any of these equative clauses makes for a slight difference
in meaning. A reording of (226d), for example, yields tsi kila-d-ßn gimi = na [I steal- 1-REAL
money = this] ‘The money I stole is this,’ in which ‘this’ is the predicator.
6.1.1.1Negative equativeThe negative equative copula is odoq, which can occur virtually anywhere the zero
copula occurs. The negative of (226b) and (226d), for example, is as follows:
(227)a. na gimi
tsi-yi odoq
this money I-GEN is.not
‘This money is not mine.’
85Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Basic clause types
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
odoq
b. na tsi kila-d-ßn
gimi
this I steal-1-REAL money is.not
‘This is not money that I stole.’
We have recorded a few cases in which the equative copula (Ø or odoq) occurs with
adjectives, an environment in which one might expect the “predicate adjective” copula.
Of course, the predicate adjective copula does occur in this environment (as in na
pæurlu≥ tsu ‘This is red’; see example (237a) below), but where the equative occurs, the
implication is that one particular item is chosen from among many as having the relevant
feature – ‘This one is long’ or ‘This is the long one.’ In effect, the adjective is rendered
as a nominal. This is similar to what occurs in Nepali and other languages of the region,
like Kham. In Kusunda, however, because the positive construction is verbless, it is
more difficult to determine the correct interpretation in that context:
(228)a. na li≥wa Ø
this heavy (copula)
‘This one is heavy’ / ‘This is the heavy one.’
b. na l˙≥ka odoq
this long is.not
‘This one is not long’ / ‘This is not the long one.’There is still a possibility that we have interpreted (228a) incorrectly. Perhaps
adjectives are “verbal” enough in their semantics that they can be used as simple
predicators, in which case (228a) should be interpreted to mean ‘This is heavy.’ Given,
however, that the negative equative is possible here, we are assuming that the adjective in
the verbless construction, too, is functioning as a nominal.
6.1.1.2An equative copulaThere is an equative copula b˙t, which is in some ways the positive counterpart of the
negative equative described above. However, the copula b˙t occurs only rarely, and there
may be pragmatic constraints on its use. Following are examples:
(229)a. tsi b˙t
I
equative
‘It’s me.’
b. tsi mo≥ b˙t
I king equative
‘I am the king.’
c. ta
hol-di
amba
this cook-ADJ meat
‘This is cooked meat.’b˙t
equativeNote that in (229b) the implication is similar to what we described for (228a) – the
referent is singled out from among many – ‘I am the one who is king,’ not just ‘I am a
king.’ Likewise, the equative copula b˙t can also occur with adjectives, in which case the
adjective functions as a nominal:
(230)b˙t
tsi h~ukui
I
small
equative
‘I am a small/unimportant (person).’ / Not *I am small.
86Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
We are unaware of any tense distinctions for this copula or for the Ø equative
copula.
6.1.2Existential copulaThe existential copula is tsu in the positive and kæaÚu in the negative. It does not
conjugate for person, number, or for tense (that we are aware of), although there are
some limited aspectual notions supported by it. The same copulas (positive and negative)
used for existential senses are also used in predicate adjective constructions.
6.1.2.1ExistenceIt is important to distinguish in Kusunda the difference between “existence in a
location” and “location.” The former expresses that something exists in a given
location, like ‘In the tree is a monkey,’ whereas the latter focuses on the actual location
of a given referent, as in ‘The monkey is in the tree.’ The existential copula is used
primarily to express the former – existence in a location. Pure existence, as in any
language, is rare in Kusunda:
(231)a. tsi-˙i
tsu
my-father exist
‘My father is’ / ‘My father is living’ / ‘I have a father.’
b. wu
tsi-˙i
tsu
home my-father exist
‘My father is (at) home.’
c. yi-g˙ ha o
tsu
tree-IN monkey exist
‘In the tree is a monkey’ / ‘There is a monkey in the tree.’
d. tu
dukæu tsu
snake two
exist
‘There are two snakes.’
(tsi would mean ‘Two snakes are there’ / ‘There are two snakes there’)6.1.2.2Negative existentialThe negative existential is kæaÚu. We noted earlier (see the discussion following
example (74) and §5.5.4.1) that the actual negative sequence is -aÚu, with pharyngealization
on the first vowel and falling-rising pitch on the full sequence. This suggests that the
original negative sequence is something like -a)u, with kh-a)u as the negative existential.
This leaves kh- as the negative existential verb root, a suppletive form with no apparent
relationship to tsu. Following are examples:
(232)a. ta≥
tsu
water exist
‘There is water.’
a. ta≥
kæ-aÚ u
water neg.exist-not
‘There is no water.’< kæ-a87uWatters: Kusunda Grammar; Basic clause types
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
6.1.2.3PossessionAs reflected in the glosses in (231a) pure existence is rare, and used in conjunction
with possessive clauses, the interpretation is one of possession – ‘I have a father’
(though the literal translation is ‘My father is’). Following are examples of typical
possessive clauses:
(233)a. tsi-h~ukui dahat tsu
my-small three exist
‘I have three children.’ (lit. ‘my little ones three exist’)
b. nu-ma
˙si
tsu?
you-WITH how.many exist
‘How many do you have?’ (lit. ‘with you how many exist?’)
c. tsi-ma
qasti tsu
I-WITH one exist
‘I have one.’ (lit. ‘with me one exists’)Negative possession uses the same negative existential verb that we saw earlier –
kæaÚu. Following is an example:
(234)6.1.2.4tsi-h~ukui qasti b˙
kæaÚ u
my-little
one even is.not
‘I don’t have even one child.’
Dative subject constructionsIn “dative subject constructions” feelings/emotions/pain are construed as existing
‘to’ a referent, as in ‘Hunger is to me.’ In terms of syntax, the construction is similar to
the possessive clause construction, the major difference being in the marking of the
topical argument – ‘with me’ in possessive clauses, and ‘to me’ in dative clauses.
(235)t˙n-da
ida≥
tsu
me-DAT hunger exist
‘I am hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is to me’)The negative uses the same existential negative kæaÚu that we saw earlier:
(236)6.1.2.5t˙n-da
ida≥
kæaÚ u
me-DAT hunger is.not
‘I am not hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is not to me’)
Predicate adjectiveThe “predicate adjective” construction – ‘He is tall,’ ‘I am big,’ etc. – predicates
adjectival notions through the help of the existential copula tsu, as in:
(237)a. na pæurlu≥ tsu
this red
is
‘This is red.’
b. tsi-h~ukui li≥wa tsu
my-small heavy is
‘My child is heavy.’
88Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
The negative uses the same existential negative kæaÚu we saw earlier:
c. tsi-h~ukui li≥wa kæaÚ u
my-small heavy is.not
‘My child is not heavy.’
d. ben amba ola≥ kæaÚ u
raw meat tasty is.not
‘Raw meat is not tasty.’
The predicate adjective construction is also used to predicate attributes designated by
“participles” (here partially-finite adnominals), as in the following:
(238)a. suta
bæ˙ra-q-ßn
tsu
string break-AC-REAL is
‘The string is broken.’
b. k˙re k˙la-q-ßn
lan tsu
pot break-AC-REAL like is
‘The pot is about to break.’ (lit. ‘is like it will break’)As shown in (228a), the adjective can occur also without the copula, in which case it
is interpreted as a nominal in an equative clause – ‘I am a small person.’ (See also
(230).)
6.1.3Locational copulaThe locational copula is used to predicate the location of a referent – it is in such and
such a place. It differs from the existential copula, in that the latter expresses that the
referent exists, whether explicitly in a place or not.
The locational copula is tsi in the positive and kæaÚi in the negative. Recall that the
negative existential was kæaÚu. Contrasting kæaÚu with kæaÚi we have further evidence
that the sequences were originally tri-morphemic – kæ-a)-u versus kæ-a)-i. Following
are examples:
(239)(240)POSITIVE:a. tsi tsi
I loc.copula‘I am (here).’b. tsi t˙isa
I here‘I am here.’tsi
loc.copulac. nu tsi?

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
b. gina
kæaÚ i
he/she loc.neg
‘He is not (there).’
Notice that sentences (239a) and (239b) are very nearly synonymous, as are (239c)
and (239d). What is implied in sentence (a) and (c) is made explicit by a locative adverb
in (b) and (d). Notice, too, how this copula contrasts with the existential copula.
Following are contrastive examples:
(241)a. EXISTENTIAL:
yi-g˙
ha o
tsu
tree-LOC monkey exist
‘In the tree is a monkey.’ / ‘There is a monkey in the tree.’
b. LOCATIONAL:
ha o
yi-g˙
tsi
monkey tree-LOC loc.copula
‘The monkey is in the tree.’In §5.2.2.4, example (124), we saw that in possessive clauses marked by the comitative
-ma ‘with,’ both existential and locational locatives can be used felicitously. Where the
existential is used the assertion is concerned with the existence of the item; where the
locational is used the assertion is concerned with the location of the item:
(242)a. EXISTENTIAL POSSESSIVE:
tsi-ma gimi
tsu
I-WITH money exist
‘I have some money on me.’ (lit. ‘money exists with me.’)
b. LOCATIONAL POSSESSIVE:
tsi-ma gimi
tsi
I-WITH money loc.copula
‘I have money.’ (lit. ‘money is located with me.’)6.1.4The inchoative and the causativeThe inchoative and the causative are treated here as subtypes of copular constructions
because 1) they serve frequently as verbs in “light verb” constructions (i.e. where the
real predication is done by a nominal and the verb is semantically empty), 2) they have
an intransitive–transitive paradigmatic relationship to one another, and 3) they form the
basis for verbal conjugation in “non-inflecting verbs” (see §5.5.1.2). Following are
some light verb constructions, all transitive, and all of which utilize the verb ‘to do,’ as in
the following:
(243)a. p˙idzi bun˙

‘She is weaving cloth.’ (lit. ‘does weaving’)

There is some question about whether there is a phonological distinction between the
inchoative ‘become’ and the causative ‘make.’ Under careful articulation we recorded
distinct paradigms, but on the following day our informants would often give either
interpretation for either paradigm. There may be a single ambi-transitive verb with the
interpretation based on pragmatics. It is difficult to say at this stage. Nevertheless, we
give here two separate paradigms:

3p a-g˙-kWe have a few sentences in our corpus in which there is a clear distinction between
“inchoative” and “causative” roots:
(245)tsi mo≥ ˙-d-u
s˙h˙r a-d-u
make-1-IRR:SG
I king become-1-IRR:SG city
‘I will become king and I will make a city.’The status of the inchoative realis is confusing, with what appears to be a lot of
variation, and we can say nothing substantive about it.
As we have shown earlier (see §5.5.1.2), Class II transitive conjugations are patterned
after the “causative” paradigm, i.e. based on the auxiliary verb ‘to do, make,’ as in the
following contrastive examples (‘do’ marks the Class II auxiliary verb root):91Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Basic clause types
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
(246)a. MAKE (CAUSATIVE)
tsi a-t-ßn
I make-1-REAL
‘I made it.’b. CLASS II TRANSITIVE
tsi dzo -a-t-ßn
I wet-do-1-REAL
‘I soaked it.’c. CLASS II TRANSITIVE
tsi abi-a-t-ßn
I carry-do-1-REAL
‘I carried it.’d. CLASS II TRANSITIVE
tsi hul˙-d-ßn < hul˙ a-t-ßn
I cook-1-REAL
‘I cooked it.’Where the verb root ends in a consonant, (246b), or in a vowel radically different
from the first vowel [a] of the causative root ‘make,’ (246c), the causative root surfaces
unscathed – a-t-ßn [make-1-REAL]. Where the verb root ends in [˙] or [a], the two vowels
tend to coalesce, as in (246d).
We have a few examples in which the inchoative version of the verb root [˙-] can be
used in a kind of “passive” sense, but this is almost expecting too much of the
distinction between [˙] and [a] where the distinction is almost non-existent elsewhere.
The construction is rare in our corpus and needs more research. Following are examples:
(247)a. tsya d˙baq ˙-g-u
tea later
be-3-IRR:SG
‘Tea will be made later.’
b. tsya d˙baq hul˙ ˙-g-u
tea later
cook be-3-IRR:SG
‘Tea will be cooked later.’ / ‘will cook later’
c. gina tsya d˙baq hul˙ a-g-u
he
tea later
cook make-3-IRR:SG
‘He/she will cook tea later.’The difference between the verb in (247b) hul˙ ˙-g-u and its active counterpart in
(247c) hul˙ a-g-u is so minimal that the contrast may depend more on contrastive syntax
than anything else – the “passive” version is without an agent.
• Benefactive light verb. The verb ‘give’ is the prototypical bitranstive verb and
forms the basis for some benefactive constructions in Class II verbs. In much the same
way that ‘do’ functions as a transitive marker in Class II verbs, so too ‘give’ functions
as a bitransitive marker for some of the same verbs. The paradigm is identical to the
“causative” paradigm given in (244), with the exception that the root is e-, not a-. Most
Class II verb, however, cannot participate in this construction, and we do not yet know
what the constraints are. Following are examples (see also §10.2.3.2. example (356):
(248)a. BASE FORM:
nu tsi-wi
ukæ˙ a-n-i
you 1S-house ruin do-2-PAST
‘You ruined my house.’
b. BENEFACTIVE FORM:
nu tsi-wi
ukæ˙ e-n-i
you 1S-house ruin give-2-PAST
‘You ruined my house for me.’ (malefactive)
92Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3

(249)a. BASE FORM:
ni-ip˙n abi
a-d-u
2S-corn carry do-1-IRR:SG
‘I’ll carry your corn.’
b. BENEFACTIVE FORM:
ni-ip˙n abi
e-d-u
2S-corn carry give-1-IRR:SG
‘I’ll carry your corn for you.’There are at least two verbs in the language whose transitive morphology is based on
the verb ‘to give’ (in much the same way that Class II transitive verb conjugations are
based on the verb ‘do’). This may be because both verbs imply a dative goal – ‘write to
someone’ and ‘laugh at someone,’ as in the following:
(250)a. tsi haq lekæ e-d-i
I letter write give-1-PAST
‘I wrote a letter.’
b. tok nikæ e-d-˙k
we laugh give-1-PL:IRR
‘We will laugh (at him).’6.2Intransitive–transitive clausesMorphologically, there are few differences between transitive and intransitive verb
types. Both are indexed for a single referent – the subject referent. There is no object
marking. The major morphological differences for verbs, then, lie in the distinction
between Class I and Class II – those with prefixed or suffixed person marking, respectively.
We have already seen some of those differences in §5.5.1.1 and §5.5.1.2. The differences
have implications for number marking as well (see §5.5.2). For Class I there are both
transitive and intransitive verbs, and for Class II there are both transitive and intransitive
verbs.
However, though there are no morphological differences between transitive and
intransitive Class I verbs, there are minor differences between transitive and intransitive
Class II verbs. Thus, in terms of morphological differences, the Class I–Class II
distinction is primary, and the transitive–intransitive distinction is secondary. The differences between Class II transitive and Class II intransitive verbs lie in person marking
patterns, as shown in Figure 2:93Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Basic clause types

6.2.1Intransitive suffixing pattern 1In the most basic pattern, Class II intransitive verbs are bereft of person marking –
the suffix -ßn shown in Figure 1 is a realis marker; there is no person marker. The
distinction between persons lies only in the free pronoun:
(251)a. FIRST PERSON:
tsi sip-ßn
I
enter-REAL
‘I entered.’b. SECOND PERSON:
nu sip-ßn
you enter-REAL
‘You entered.’(252)a. FIRST PERSON:
tsi b˙l-ßn
I
descend-REAL
‘I descended.’b. SECOND PERSON:
nu b˙l-ßn
you descend-REAL
‘You descended.’6.2.2Intransitive suffixing pattern 2In what was probably a later, secondary development, person marking distinctions
developed in these ambiguous cases, analagous to the distinctions found elsewhere in
the grammar. As we have already seen in example (146), a pronominal marker, very
nearly a copy of the free pronoun, is suffixed to the root, immediately before the realis
marker, as in:
(253)a. FIRST PERSON:
tsi sip-tsi-n
I enter-1-REAL
‘I entered.’
b. SECOND PERSON:
nu sip-ni-n
you enter-2-REAL
‘You entered.’94Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
6.2.3Suffixing pattern 3In yet another development, a full copy of the free pronoun is tacked on to the end of
the verb complex, following the realis marker, as in:
(254)a. FIRST PERSON:
tsi sip-ßn-tsi
I enter-REAL-1
‘I entered.’
b. SECOND PERSON:
nu sip-ßn-nu
you enter-REAL-2
‘You entered.’• Pattern 3 in transitive verbs. The suffixing pattern described in §6.2.3 is also
available to Class II transitive verbs, as in the following:
(255)a. TRANSITIVE FIRST PERSON:
tsi hul˙-d-ßn-tsi
I cook-1-REAL-1
‘I cooked it.’
b. TRANSITIVE SECOND PERSON:
nu hul˙-n-ßn-nu
you cook-2-REAL-2
‘You cooked it.’The triple -n-ßn-n in (255b), though morphologically accurate, is a bit of phonological
fiction. Except in very carefully articulated speech, hul˙-d-ßn and hul˙-n-ßn (the basic
forms) are pronounced identically – as hul˙-d-ßn – giving rise to the need for disambiguation.
This is true of all second person forms in Class II transitive verbs: pumba-n-ßn ‘You hit
him’; d~aba-n-ßn ‘You found it’; m˙b˙-n-ßn ‘You heard it’; unda-n-ßn ‘You showed it,’ etc.
Except in careful speech, all are pronounced with a -d.3 1
6.2.4Bitransitive verbsThe only convincing bitransitive verb in Kusunda is the verb ‘to give,’ with all other
bitransitive notions being benefactive constructions that utilize the verb ‘to give.’
Morphologically, the verb ‘give’ is identical to Class II transitive verbs (see Figure 1),
the only exception being the verb root itself.
6.3Clausal syntaxSyntax in Kusunda follows a basic SV, AOV constituent order, the verb coming last.
This order is typologically pervasive throughout South Asia. In Kusunda, because the
person and number of the subject (S or A) referent is marked in the verb, the subject NP,
even as a pronominal form, is usually elided. This is in keeping with universal expectations
that in unmarked clauses, the subject is usually excluded from the scope of assertion
(Givón 1984, 1991). Where the subject NP does occur, especially in connected speech,
31We have not recorded “suffixing pattern 3” (§6.2.3) for all these verbs, though they may exist.
This needs further verification.","[85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95]"

No one could have guessed, early in 2004, that before the year was out we would get
lucky with Kusunda. At the time, all we had were a couple of word lists, one from the
1850s and another from the 1970s; plus a short text that was largely uninterpretable.
We knew almost nothing about the grammar – doubly lamentable in light of the fact that
Kusunda was recognized as a language isolate, related to no other language on earth. In
some quarters, the last speaker was reported to have died in 1985, and though some
Nepalese linguists and anthropologists were aware of one or two Kusundas with a vague
memory of their ancestral tongue, the situation was not hopeful, and most of us had
resigned ourselves to the notion that we would never know more about Kusunda than
what we already knew.
In the midst of this unpromising circumstance, our friends at the National Foundation
for the Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN), especially Vice-Chairman
Prof. Sant Bahadur Gurung and Member Secretary Mr. Tamla Ukyab, never gave up. It
is impossible to overemphasize our indebtedness to them. In April 2004, with help from
the National Indigenous Nationalities Women’s Forum, they brought three Kusundas to
Kathmandu from Dang Valley to help them with citizenship papers – a practical, first
step in helping them and making a simple thing like land ownership a possibility for
them. They also arranged a press conference in which they introduced the Kusundas to
the public and to the academic community – sociologists, anthropologists, and linguists.
It was there that we discovered that one of them, Ms. Gyani Maiya Sen, had more than a
passive knowledge of Kusunda; she could actually speak it!
We, at the Central Department of Linguistics (CDL), Tribhuvan University, immediately
made a proposal to Prof. Gurung and Mr. Ukyab to help us in bringing Gyani Maiya
and possibly other Kusunda speakers into Kathmandu for a three month period of
intensive linguistic research. Their response was magnanimous. Not only did NFDIN
agree to fund the research and documentation project, they also sent one of their own
people, Mr. Dinesh Gurung, to Dang to bring the speakers to Kathmandu.
Once in Kathmandu, Mr. Jagat Gurung, also of NFDIN, dealt with many practical
arrangements, like finding lodging for the Kusundas and taking them on weekend tours
to the zoo and to numerous religious sites. We are grateful for his willing contribution.
We are also grateful to Mr. Stephen Watters, of SIL and CDL, for making digital
recordings of many Kusunda sounds, and to Dinesh Khadga of Kantipur Photo Studio
for making video recordings of several elicitation sessions. All electronic media are now
housed at the CDL library, and make a valuable addition to their language archives.
Without question, our greatest debt of gratitude goes to the Kusunda speakers who
accepted the invitation to come to Kathmandu – Ms. Gyani Maiya Sen, Ms. Kamala
Singh Khatri, and Mr. Prem Bahadur Shahi Thakuri. Back in Dang, Gyani Maiya
contacted Prem Bahadur, her uncle, and Prem Bahadur contacted Kamala, his niece, who
lived in Rolpa. Only Gyani Maiya had been to Kathmandu before, at the recent invitation
of NFDIN. But for all of them, a three month stay in Kathmandu was a leap of faith.
They were at the mercy of strangers, not knowing fully what to expect. When they
arrived, they quickly settled into their new situation, cheerfully sharing their language
and their lives.
Four of us at CDL, Linguistics Chair Prof. Yogendra Prasad Yadava, Prof. Madhav
Prasad Pokharel, Mr. Balaram Prasain, and myself, had separate, daily sessions with our
new-found friends, keeping them busy the whole day long. Once a week, we debriefed

one another in public, “chalk-board discussions,” well attended by faculty and students
of the linguistics department. I should make clear that the three participants do not
necessarily agree with all my interpretations presented in this grammar. Any and all
errors are my own.
At the end of the research period, NFDIN hosted another press conference, at which
the Kusundas were fêted, and the principal investigators were given opportunity to
present their findings. An invited speaker, State Minister for Local Development Mr.
Krishna Gopal Shrestha, promised his support for projects aimed at uplifting indigenous
nationalities. Several other dignitaries, including Prof. Sant Bahadur Gurung, Prof.
Yogendra Prasad Yadava, Prof. Madhav Prasad Pokharel, Prof. Novel Kishore Rai, and
visiting Prof. Sueyoshi Toba, gave unanimous voice to the overriding value of language
documentation and preservation efforts. The conference was reported in all the major
Nepalese dailies for Asoj 24, 2061, BS (October 10, 2004).
A special note of thanks goes to Professors R. M. W. Dixon and Alexandra Aikhenvald
for inviting me as an Honorary Visiting Fellow to their Research Centre for Linguistic
Typology (RCLT) at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia. I was able to spend
three months, uninterrupted, analyzing my notes and writing the present grammar. I was
also given opportunity to present my findings and analysis at an RCLT seminar, receiving
valuable suggestions and comments from Robert Dixon, Alexandra Aikhenvald, Randy
LaPolla, John Saeed, Gerrold Sadock, Ghil‘ad Zuckermann, and John Hajek.
I would also like to thank Alexandra Aikhenvald, Scott DeLancey, David Bradley,
Sueyoshi Toba, and Stephen Watters for reading an earlier draft of this grammar and
making valuable comments. I have not incorporated all of them, and any shortcomings
are my own.
Last, but not least, I wish to thank the Himalayan Linguistics anonymous reviewer
who took a close, critical view of the first edition of this grammar (the NFDIN version)
and made a number of very helpful suggestions. Many of those recommendations I
have followed and incorporated into this current edition.

We also have a contrastive pair – gyaqai ‘breath’ vs. gya)ai ‘strength’ – which
may turn out to be the same word. If so, this would hint at a certain amount of variation
between [q] and [ ] and weaken our test for distinguishing one from the other.
• Nasal consonant harmony with uvular consonants. In a process of anticipatory
assimilation, the alveolar nasal consonant in the sequence [na] is realized as a palatal
consonant [¯a] wherever the following consonant is uvular, as in the following:
(72)a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.[gi¯aq]
[¯aqtsin]
[¯a an]
[¯aˆ an]
[¯~aˆ di]1 3
[¯~aˆ gitse]
[¯~aˆ dzi]‘trousers’
‘I wait.’
‘You will go.’
‘You sat.’
‘wife’
‘daughter’
‘You look.’• Establishing underlying [)] in contexts where it is “compressed”. There are
several constructions in Kusunda in which an underlying [ ] can be posited based on
the two principles discussed immediately above – pharyngealization (plus lowered pitch)
and consonantal harmony. The negative construction is one such context. Uvular [ ] is
compressed to such an extent in these kinds of high frequency environments that only
its secondary (concomitant) phonetic features are perceptible.
In the first pair below we give the affirmative forms for ‘I went,’ and ‘You went.’ In
the second pair are the negative forms:
(73)a. [ts˙g˙n]
b. [n˙g˙n](74)a. [t aÚ u]
b. [¯aÚ u]‘I went.’
‘You went.’
<
<[t a u]
[¯a u]‘I did not go.’
‘You did not go.’In (74a) and (74b), the sequence [aÚ u] comes from an underlying [a u], as evidenced
by pharyngealization on the vowel preceding [ ]. Evidence for underlying [ ] is further
supported by the change from [ts] and [n] affirmative to [t ] and [¯] negative in (74a–b).
• The voicing contrast between [q] and [)]. There are a number of intransitive
verb roots which end in [q], which when causativized end up as [ ] sandwiched between
vowels. It is likely that the consonant in the causativized version is also an underlying
[q], now voiced in the new environment. However, we are not yet sure if voicing plays a
role in causativization, or in any other grammatical marking. Unusual contrasts, like the
contrast between velar [g] and uvular [ ] plays a role in TAM marking (see §5.5.3.1),
and until we are sure about voicing in causativization, we will err on the side of caution
and continue to write the intervocalic uvular as / / in causative contexts. Following are
examples:B. K. Rana (2002) transcribes this as ngyangdi [≥ya≥di], and claims that initial ≥- is evidence
of TB origins for Kusunda. We have found no occurrences of initial ≥- in our investigation.

lowered to [ø], as in (see also (69b)):
(78)a. ha o
b. to on[ha wø]
[to wøn]‘rhesus monkey’
‘day before yesterday’• Uvular [q]. The voiceless uvular consonant [q] occurs in a variety of contexts –
syllable initially, syllable finally, and in a few cases, intervocalically. As already mentioned,
it is difficult to distinguish between [q] and post-velar [ßk] which occurs before [o] or [a].

Where [q] occurs word finally with a preceding [h] it surfaces as [≈], as in mehaq
[meha≈] ‘Ban Raja’ or haq [ha≈]‘leaf.’
• Uvular [ˆ]. The uvular nasal consonant [ˆ] has many of the characteristics and
concomitant features found in [ ] – pharyngealization of preceding vowels, lowering of
fundamental frequencies, and harmony with palatal nasals. Most of these features have
already been illustrated, as in (72d–g). In addition, the nasal consonant [ˆ] imposes
nasalization on the preceding vowel. In some words, it is this feature alone that distinguishes
[ˆ] words from [ ] words, as in:
(82)a. [¯a an]
b. [¯~aˆ an]‘You will go.’
‘You sat.’Even with a good digital recording it is extremely difficult for us to hear the difference
between (82a) and (82b). Our informants, however, insist that they are able to distinguish
the two. No word begins with nasal [ˆ]. In this sense it is parallel to [≥].

which the consonants remain constant, but one word utilizes a vowel from the upper set

pairs for vowels. In many words, especially within polysyllabic morphemes, there is a
certain amount of free variation between the two sets (as borne out in tape recordings

It turns out that much of the free variation we encountered occurs in polysyllabic
words where [h] or one of the velar sounds [k], [g], or [≥] occurs. It is significant, in
this respect, that uvular sounds, especially the voiced ones [ ], and [ˆ], occur only with
vowels [o] and [a], displaying a kind of harmony within a syllable.7 It is not altogether
surprising, then, to find their neighbors, the velar sounds, somewhat ambivalent in their
preference of upper or lower vowels.

"12410. Clause chaining
“Clause chaining” is a clause combining strategy very common in the languages of
South Asia and syntactically distinct from English-type “co-ranking” structures like He
went to the forest and set traps. A basic feature common to classical clause chaining
languages is the distinction between chain-medial and chain-final verbs. Typically, the
verb belonging to the chain-final clause is the most finite, being marked for things like
person/number agreement and tense/aspect distinctions. Verbs belonging to chain-medial
clauses, on the other hand, are less finite, sometimes pared down to a simple verb root
plus some kind of non-final marker. Thus, it is termed “co-subordinate.” It is
subordinate in that it depends on the final verb for certain finite specifications, but
coordinate in that it lacks many features of true subordinates (Haspelmath 1995).
With respect to clause chaining, Kusunda is typologically distinct from the languages
immediately surrounding it. First of all it distinguishes on a temporal scale between
“sequential” events and “overlapping” events, and secondly, it marks sequential events
as “co-ranking” and overlapping events as “co-subordinate.” In the surrounding
languages, like Nepali and Kham, there is no formal distinction between sequential and
overlapping events, and the only strategy employed is the co-subordinate one.
10.1Sequential eventsSequential events occur in temporal chronology – Having eaten he left is an example;
eating occurs first and leaving second. Kusunda has such sequences, but all verbs in the
chain – medial and final – are fully finite. Furthermore, medial verbs have no special
marker to distinguish them from final verbs. As such, these are “co-ranking” structures
(Longacre 1985) and differ from the “co-subordinate” structures we will look at in
§10.2. Following are examples:
(342)a. hyoq-ts-in

‘I hid and I slept.’ (I hid and slept.)

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
All of the sequences above retain the same subject for both verbs and would occur in
other languages of the region as classic clause chains – the first verb would occur as a
non-finite medial verb (plus linking morphology), and only the final verb would occur as
fully finite with person inflection. English, too, would treat all the sentences in (342) as
“same-subject” chains by deleting the second pronoun — ‘You hid and you slept.’
The kinds of sequences illustrated in (342) are not formally different from the
coordinated structures we will look at in §11.1. The only difference, if any, might be
based on semantic inferences. The structures here were elicited as sequential chains
(using Nepali -er˙), while the structures in §11.1 were elicited as non-chains like After I
eat I will go.
10.1.1Negation in sequential chainsOne consequence of having finite marking on both verbs is their logical independence
of one another. Under negation, it appears (tentatively, at least) that the scope of the
negative applies only to the negated verb, something not necessarily true for classical
clause chaining languages. In classical clause chaining languages, negation on the final
verb can extend backwards to the medial verb as well, as in the following example from
Kham (Watters 2002:327):
(343)m˙d˙ cæokoraÚ o-d˙
ta-s˙-m~ï:h-si-c-yo
wine beer
drink-NF PROH-CAUS-drunk-DETRANS-2P-IMP
‘Don’t get yourselves drunk drinking beer and wine!’The inference is that you should not drink and get drunk – drinking is also prohibited.
However, cause and effect must be semantically well integrated before the scope of
negation on the final verb extends back to include the medial verb. Unfortunately, our
corpus of data does not include examples of negative clause chains where the two events
can be thought of as semantically well integrated, and under such circumstances it is
impossible to know if the scope of the negative in semantically integrated events is more
inclusive than it is in semantically discontinuous events.
10.1.1.1 Negation of the medial verb
Where the medial verb in a clause chain is negated, the scope of negation is local – it
applies to that verb alone. Following are examples:
(344)a. tsi t-˙m-daÚ u
t-ug-un
1-come-REAL
I 1-eat-REAL:NEG
‘I came without eating.’ (lit. ‘I didn’t eat, I came.’)
b. po≈la-g-aÚ i

‘He ate without bathing.’ (lit. ‘He didn’t bathe, he ate.’)
c. teina tumba-d-aÚ u,
goraq
tumb˙-d-u
today finish-1-REAL:NEG, tomorrow finish-1-IRR
‘Not finishing it today, I’ll finish it tomorrow.’10.1.1.2 Negation of the final verb
We have very few examples of this structure, but the ones that we do have often
imply “condition,” which will be treated more fully in §11.2. Following are two
126Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3

b. nu t˙n-da

I fear-1-NEG:IRR

‘(Even if) you beat me I won’t be afraid.’
(lit. ‘You will beat me, I won’t be afraid.’)A third example implies opposition:

g-˙m-daÚ u
he
bathe-3-PAST 3-eat-REAL:NEG
‘He bathed (but) he didn’t eat.’
A second negativeBoth medial and final verbs sometimes employ a second negative. Though we can
surmise on the origin of its structure, we do not know how this negative differs semantically
from the one illustrated in §10.1.1 above. We give two examples of a medial verb
negated by this second negative (a–b), and one example of a final verb (c):
(347)a. gina po≈la kæaÚ i
g-˙m-˙n
he

‘He didn’t bathe and he ate.’ (He ate without bathing.)
b. wa

‘He didn’t come home and he slept on the trail.’ OR
‘Not coming home, he slept on the trail.’
c. gimi
meÚ-d-i
d~aba-n˙ kæaÚ i
be:REAL:NEG
money lose-1-PAST, find-2
‘I lost the money and you didn’t find it.’Beginning with (347a), the expected negative form for a finite, realis Class II verb
would be po≈la-g-aÚi (bathe-3-REAL:NEG), the -g being a third person agreement marker.
The negative kæaÚi, on the other hand, is the negative existential copula, now used as
negation marker on non-copular verbs. (See Negative existential under §6.1.2.1.) The
use of copular verbs in modality systems, of course, is widespread in the languages of
the world, South Asia included. This is the first instance, however, that we have seen it
in Kusunda.
In §8.1.4 we saw examples of bare verb roots used in concatenative structures like
hol t-˙m-du (cook 1-eat-IRR:SG) ‘I’ll cook and eat.’ The first root, hol, is followed by a
second finite root, t-˙m-du, without intervening morphology of any kind. The negative
construction that we are dealing with here is a parallel structure – the negative copula
follows the bare root. It is reasonable that such “bare root” verbs should be negated by
the existential, without all the finite machinery of conjugated verbs.
The form of the final verb in (347c) is also unexpected. We would expect d~aba-n-aÚi
(find-2-REAL:NEG). Final verbs are always finite, being marked for TAM and person/num127Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Clause chaining
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
ber information, and (347c) manages to tack a second person marker -n˙ onto the end of
the first root. It is very likely, in fact, that the grammaticalization pathway for d~aba-n-aÚi
is < *d~aba-n˙ kæaÚi.
It may turn out, then, after further study, that the “concatenative” structure is the
“real” clause chaining device and the structures illustrated in (342) are coordinated
“co-ranking” structures on the English model.
10.2Overlapping eventsKusunda has a second kind of clause chaining device whose structure (but not
function) is more in keeping with areal expectations. In this second device, medial verbs
are non-finite and marked by a clause-chaining suffix -de3 5, while final verbs are fully
finite for person marking and TAM. The surprising thing about Kusunda, however, is
that this structure does not mark sequential events. (This was far from obvious in our
early work because of the perceived similarity with Nepali sequential events.) The
non-sequential nature of the structure was especially difficult to detect in contexts like
the following where it is difficult to imagine anything but a sequential reading:
(348)a. am-de
u-g-i
eat-CNV come-3-PAST
‘He came while eating.’ (i.e. before finishing his meal)3 6
b. ip-de
t-ug-un
sleep-CNV 1-come-REAL
‘I came while sleeping.’ (i.e. before the night was over)
c. hyoq-de
ts-ip-ßn
hide-CNV 1-sleep-REAL
‘I slept (while) hiding.’In the linguistic literature, the opposite of a sequential event has often been referred
to as a “simultaneous” event, as in While she was cooking she tended the baby. As we
will show, however, the term “overlapping” event represents the data in Kusunda better
than the term “simultaneous,” and is the one we will use throughout. Thus (346a) does
not necessarily mean (though it can mean) that he was eating while coming down the
road, which is what a simultaneous reading would give.
10.2.1Cause and effectFor expressions of “cause and effect” it might seem that a sequential event structure
would be more appropriate than an overlapping event structure. But presumably because
of close topic continuity between the events in a cause–effect vector, they are frequently
coded as overlapping, as in:35The suffix -de is also the converbal marker for some dialects of Kham (with variants -di and -d˙
in other dialects). Classical Tibetan has (s)-te.
36When asked for the meaning of sentences like these, our informants’ response in Nepali would
typically be khaer˙ ayo 'Having eaten he came.’ But when asked for the Kusunda equivalent of khaer˙
ayo they were prone to respond with the sequential construction g-˙m-˙n u-g-i (3-eat-REAL come-3-PAST)
‘He ate and he came.’128Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3

‘I slept sitting up.’

eat-CNV talk
‘I talked while eating.’
e. gilas-ga sib-a-de
g-o -on
glass-IN enter-CAUS-CNV 3-put-REAL
‘He put it in the glass by stuffing it.’The last sentence, (350e), is a good example of the “adverbial” reading of some
converbs. Such a reading comes as a result of overlap or simultaneity. The ‘putting’
and the ‘stuffing’ occur at the same time, but ‘stuffing’ describes the manner in which it
was put.
The benefactive construction and the ‘teach’ converbal (which we will treat in §10.2.3
and §10.2.4 respectively) give further evidence of the “overlap” reading of the Kusunda
converb.
10.2.3The benefactive constructionThe benefactive construction is marginal in Kusunda, and compared with the surrounding languages, is typologically exceptional. Except in a restricted case (which we
will see in a subsection below), the benefactive requires no derivational machinery.
129Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Clause chaining
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Usually, all that is required is the addition of a dative argument3 7 to a transitive clause, as
in the following:
(351)a. BASIC TRANSITIVE:
tsi wi
a-t-ßn
I
house make-1-REAL
‘I built a house.’
b. BENEFACTIVE:
tsi gin-da
wi
a-t-ßn
I
him-DAT house make-1-REAL
‘I built a house for him.’Such a construction is also available to some TB languages, but only on verbs that
are marginally bitransitive – verbs like ‘send’ or ‘show.’ Such verbs have transitive and
bitransitive uses, as in the following example from Tamang:
(352)TAMANG (from Taylor 1973:106-107)
a. TRANSITIVE USE:apa-ce
the-ta
buh-ri pit-ci
father-ERG he-DAT field-to send-TAM
‘Father sent him to the field.’
b. BITRANSITIVE USE:
the-ce apa-ta
chiTi pit-ci
he-ERG father-DAT letter send-TAM
‘He sent a letter to Father.’
In other TB languages, like Kham, the transitivity of verbs is fixed, and even verbs
like ‘send’ and ‘show’ are inherently transitive. For such verbs to be used in a
bitransitive (benefactive) sense requires an applicative derivation in the verb. The derivation
employs the verb ‘to give’ (with a non-literal reading) in a clause chaining construction:
(353)KHAM (from Watters 2002:239)
a. TRANSITIVE USE:no-e

‘He sent me a letter.’
Nepali, like Tamang, has transitive and bitransitive senses for verbs like ‘send’ and
‘show.’ For verbs with a fixed transitive reading, however, Nepali, like Kham (and
Tamang), requires a benefactive derivation which employs a non-literal usage of the verb
‘to give.’37It is also possible to use a modification of the Nepali -ko lagi, as in: tsi-lage limu-dzi
(me-FOR fight-TAM) ‘He fought for me’ (on my behalf). See the ‘benefactive’ under §5.2.2.4.","[124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"

"Linguistic typeKusunda is related to no other language or language family of South Asia; indeed,
as far as we can tell, to no other language on earth – it is a true linguistic “isolate”.
There are, to be sure, a few lexical borrowings from surrounding languages, both from
Indo-Aryan and from Tibeto-Burman. But all such borrowings are relatively recent and
have nothing to do with its genetic lineage.
The status of some linguistic isolates can be extremely difficult to determine; such
languages may have been sufficiently influenced through long-term contact with
surrounding languages that they begin to resemble them both grammatically and lexically.
The original language provides only a substrate. Kusunda has not escaped at least some
such influence, but, by and large, it remains a typological isolate – i.e. it is phonologically,
lexically, and grammatically distinct. Thus, we can be reasonably safe in assuming that
throughout most of its history Kusunda developed in isolation, and only in recent times
has it had contact with other linguistic types.
Phonologically, Kusunda possesses sounds that do not exist in other languages of
the region – namely, uvular and pharyngealized consonants. Conversely, there are
sounds found throughout the region, like retroflex consonants, that do not occur in
Kusunda. Furthermore, the point of articulation in Kusunda is more-or-less immaterial,
it is the active articulator that counts as contrastive.
The uvular consonants are accompanied by the concomitant features of pharyngeal
stricture and lower fundamental frequencies on preceding vowels. Such features, in fact,
are often the primary auditory cues to their presence.
The voicing contrast in Kusunda is neutralized in many consonants, having a lesser
functional load than in surrounding languages.
Vowels in Kusunda occur partially in harmonic sets, an upper set comprising three
vowels and a lower set comprising three vowels. There is considerable free variation
between the two sets, and only in a few words can opposing vowels in upper and lower
sets be shown to be contrastive. This suggests that Kusunda may have at one time had a
simple, three vowel system – i, a, o.
Consonant sounds in Kusunda occur at many points of articulation – bilabial, dental,
alveolar, palatal, retroflex, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal. Most of the points,
however, are non-contrastive, and there can sometimes be considerable variation even in
single words. What is more material for Kusunda, then, is to describe consonant
sounds in terms of their active articulator – labial, apical, laminal, velar, and uvular/pharyngeal. An apical consonant, for example, can be dental, alveolar, or retroflex.
One of the most striking and unusual aspects of Kusunda grammar is the means by
which “marked” structures are distinguished from “unmarked” ones. The “mark” is
not an affix, as typical of the region or indeed of the languages of the world, but rather, a
harmonic autosegmental process (which we will refer to as “mutation”) that spreads
“retraction” across the entire word. Apical consonants become laminal, velar consonants
become uvular, and vowels from the upper set shift to the lower set. The process
appears to be very old, and occurs today only in a very small subset of high frequency
verbs.
Vestiges of this striking morphophonological process are still apparent in several
categories and may represent the morphologization of a single process in different
contexts – all ‘marked’ categories. Thus, the marked modality is irrealis (while the
unmarked category is realis); the marked polarity is negative; the marked transitivity is
20Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
causative; and the marked dependency is dependent. All of these systems utilize mutation
as a mark (at least to a partial extent).
There are very few case marking affixes in Kusunda, but an affix -da occurs as a
distinguishing morpheme in numerous systems. In some cases a single etymological
source can be plausibly inferred – -da is a local case marker, the marker of an animate
object in transitive clauses, and occurs in some complement clauses. In other cases,
different morphemes that just happen to be homophonous must be assumed – -da is a
plural number agreement in verbs, a marker of incompletive aspect, and a morphological
causative.
Syntax in Kusunda follows a basic SV, AOV constituent order, with alternative
orders used to mark specialized pragmatic notions. This is common in the linguistic
area. Subject NPs are often deleted in running discourse, the person and number of the
subject actant being recoverable from obligatory person–number agreement markers in
the verb. In terms of grammatical case marking, Kusunda follows a nominative–accusative
case marking alignment – something unusual for the languages of the region.
Verbs in Kusunda divide broadly into Class I and Class II. In Class I verbs, person
agreement is marked by prefixes and number by suffixes, whereas in Class II verbs both
person agreement and number is marked by suffixes. Class I verbs are old with a lot of
irregularity in the paradigms and an abundance of suppletive forms. The majority of
verbs belong to Class II. Such verbs can be thought of as “non-inflecting,” i.e. all
inflection falls on an auxiliary based on the verb ‘to make, to do.’ Class II intransitive
verbs are basically bereft of person marking, with a new, innovative person marking
distinction developing in some contexts.
The basic TAM system in Kusunda makes a binary distinction between realis and
irrealis. Class II verbs have also developed a past tense distinction, a distinction that is
generally missing from Class I verbs.
There are derivational operations in Kusunda whereby inherently intransitive verbs
can be made transitive, and inherently transitive verbs made intransitive – the latter a kind
of “middle” derivation. Both operations are morphological, and causativization always
yields a Class II verb. Periphrastic causatives are also possible, in which case the caused
event is embedded to the causativizing matrix verb ‘to make, to do.’
Verb subordination (or embedding) occurs in numerous Kusunda structures – relative
clauses, verbal complements, periphrastic causatives, and applicatives. A striking feature
in Kusunda, unusual for the typology of the region, is that such embedded structures
appear not to be nominalized (although our so-called ‘neutral’ verbs are possible candidates
for nominalization; see §8.1 and §9.1.2). Most subordinate structures are fully finite
and their embedded status is signalled entirely by their syntax. (In mutating verbs,
subordination is also marked by mutation.)
Some, but not all, clause chains in Kusunda are marked by converbs. Unusual,
however, is that converbs in Kusunda do not mark sequential events, but “overlapping”
ones. Sequential chains are marked by a series of fully finite verbs. Certain periphrastic
causatives, as well as some complements (like ‘teaching how to do something’) are
marked by overlapping converbs. A structure which on the surface looks deceptively
like the benefactive in surrounding languages, is, in fact, only an overlapping converbal
structure. The benefactive, at least for some non-inflecting (Class II) verbs, is marked
by the auxiliary ‘give’ in place of the auxiliary ‘make, do.’ In most cases, however, it
requires no derivational machinery and is formed simply by the addition of a dative
argument.
214.","[20, 21, 22]"
"HarmonyVowels in Kusunda, at least to a certain extent, occur in two harmonic sets — an
upper set (i, ˙, u) and a lower set (e, a, o). In some environments, like the environment of
uvular ‘q’ or ‘ ,’ the lower set predominates, but in other environments there is considerable
free variation between the two sets – [i] varies with [e], [˙] varies with [a], and [u] varies
with [o]. Upon closer investigation, however, it becomes apparent that the two sets are,
in fact, contrastive and that the variation is related to an intrinsic tendency of
consonant–vowel “harmony” in certain parts the language.
Our attempts at nailing down vowels were constantly frustrated. One day the form
for ‘I cooked’ would be [hul˙dßn] and the next day it would be [holadßn], with no
apparent difference in meaning. Fairly predictably, though, [u] would occur in conjunction
with [˙], as in [hul˙dßn], and [o] would occur with [a], as in [holadßn]. In some cases the
harmonics mark a grammatical category, as in [n˙g˙n] ‘You went’ versus [¯a an] ‘You
will go.’ (We will treat this in more detail in §4.4.2.4 on Apcial nasals and §5.5.3.1 on
Mutation.)
Consonants are diverse with bilabial, dental, alveolar, palatal, retroflex, velar, uvular,
pharyngeal, and glottal points of articulation, but not all are contrastive. An apical sound
represented by /t/, for example, has numerous allophones – [@t], [t], [Ê] [c] – and at times
the choice of one over the other seems unprincipled. The laminal/palatal series appears
to have only weak contrastive lexical status, but it does play a contrastive role in some
grammatical systems.5 Laminals and uvulars tend to co-occur in harmonic sets.
Our analysis shows a contrast between the cardinal values for velar and uvular
consonants, but because of a certain amount of variation at the extremes we often had
difficulty in distinguishing certain varieties of velar consonants from certain varieties of
uvular consonants. The phoneme [k], for example, appears to have two major variants –
a pre-velar [k] occurring before front vowels, and a post-velar [ßk] occurring before back
vowels, and it is particularly in these ‘back’ environments that [ßk] is hardly distinguishable
from [q]. But the fact remains that some grammatical contrasts depend upon the
velar/uvular contrast. The already cited contrast between [n˙g˙n] ‘You went’ and [¯a an]
5Alexandra Aikhenvald has pointed out to me that a distinction between the phonology of roots
and the phonology of inflectional morphology can also be found in languages like Hebrew, with
""servile"" consonants being a subset of ""radical"" consonants. See, for example, Roediger 1874.",[22]

the forms, however, is far from transparent. From (141) we saw that the plural forms for
‘go’ involve a vowel change in the verb root from ˙ to i. We also saw from (150–152)
that plurality is regularly marked by -da. In (187b) and (187d) both processes occur –
thus -id- is glossed as ‘go:PL’.
Note, too, that the negative in third person uses an -i suffix in place of the -u suffix.
The negative -i occurs also in other persons, but it seems to be more prevalent in third
person contexts. We do not know if there is an implied semantic distinction between -i
and -u. This problem will require more study. One possibility that suggests itself is
that -i and -u are somehow related to the existential and locative copulas (see §6.1).
There may be evidential distinctions here.

Recall from §6.1.4 that many transitive verbs are modelled after the verb ‘to do,
make,’ as in: abi a-t-ßn (carry do-1-REAL) ‘I carry it.’ Some of the same verbs (but
apparently not all of them) can substitute the verb ‘to give’ in place of ‘to do.’ Where
this occurs, we get a benefactive reading, as in:

a finite form of the verb ‘to show.’ The following examples show that the verb ‘show’
is not in a sequential relationship with the preceding verb, but an overlapping relationship.
It implies teaching by example, ‘showing how’:

position to discuss it more fully. The ‘send’ causative contrasts with the ‘make’
132Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
causative in at least two ways. First of all, the ‘make’ causative is an implicative
causative, i.e. it implies that the embedded event also occurred. With the ‘send’ causative,
such an implication seems to be weaker (though we are not yet sure). Secondly, the
‘send’ causative employs the “overlapping converb” as part of its structure. (The
‘make’ causative did not.)
The overlapping converb carries with it the implication that the two verbs in the
clause chain are at least partially continuous, both temporally and thematically. This
contrasts with a sequential interpretation, in which the initial verb-event occurs first and
the final verb-event later. These clauses are bitransitive with a hierarchical structure.
The accusative marked object is an object of the higher verb and the embedded object is
unmarked. Following are examples:

(from Shakespeare) She sent him packing, which means something like, ‘She made him
leave.’13311. Combinations of finite clauses
In §10 we looked at clause chains of two types – 1) those that code events which occur
in temporal sequence, and 2) those that code events in which there is some kind of
temporal or semantic overlap. There is a formal structural difference – the former are
“co-ranking” in structure, all verbs being finite (and hence equal in rank, Longacre
1985), and the latter are “co-subordinate,” making a distinction between medial verbs
(non-finite) and final verbs (finite).
In this chapter we will look further at co-ranking structures – those clause combinations
in which both verbs are finite. These are clauses of coordination, of condition, of
adversity and concession. But because there are no explicit clause connectors, like
‘and’ or ‘but,’ in Kusunda, the semantic relationship between any two co-ranking
clauses is a matter of inference. This is not to say that the inferences are not dependent
on certain grammatical and pragmatic factors; they are. Two very broad factors that are
relevant to our study are 1) the level of continuity between clauses, and 2) the particular
TAM marking employed. Continuity between clauses implies conjunction, and discontinuity implies disjunction. It also turns out that irrealis marking on the final clause of a
two-clause construction almost always implies a conditional construction.
11.1CoordinationWhere the person reference in both verbs of a co-ranking structure is identical we
get something equivalent to coordination, especially where there is also continuity of
time reference between the two verbs. We looked briefly at coordination in §10.1, but
there we were contrasting it with co-subordinate strucures; here we contrast coordination
with other co-ranking structures. Following are examples of coordination, translated by
English ‘and’:
(359)a. wa
u-g-i
ip-dzi
home come-3-PAST sleep-3:PAST
‘He came home and slept.’
b. hyoq-ts-in
ts-ip-ßn
hide-1-REAL 1-sleep-REAL
‘I hid and slept.’Thus, though in Kusunda, the person and number of the subject is marked on both
verbs, their English translations elide the second pronominal reference, as in: He came
home and slept. The same Kusunda sentences could also be translated as, for example,
‘He came home, he slept’ or ‘He came home and he slept.’ Subject continuity allows,
but does not require, the elided translations given in (359). (The sentences were originally
elicited as sequential chains using Nepali -er˙, hence, the same subject in both verbs and
their English translations.)
• The adversative. The adversative is based entirely on semantic inference. It has a
basic coordinate structure, but one in which the second event of the bi-clausal structure
can be thought of as an unexpected outcome of the first event:
(360)tsi yu≥-tsi-n
ts-ip-daÚ u
I lie.down-1-REAL 1-sleep-REAL:NEG
‘I laid down, (but) I didn’t sleep.’
134Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
11.1.1Discontinuity of person referenceWhere two verbs in a sequence are marked for different subjects, a disjunction of
events is implied by the two verbs in the co-ranking structure, as reflected in the following
translations (here the second pronoun cannot be elided):
(361)a. t˙n-da
un
unda-g-i
t-ug-un
me-ACC road show-3-PAST 1-come-REAL
‘He showed me the road and I came.’
b. nu n-ug-un
tsi hyoq-ts-in
hide-1-REAL
you 2-come-REAL I
‘You came and I hid.’In examples (359–361) all verbs were cast in past time – either as realis or past
tense. In the following example both clauses are in future time, but with the same
discontinuity of person reference. Here, the second clause implies “reason”:
(362)11.1.2t˙n-da
t˙mba-yin,
tsi un
meÚ-d-u
me-ACC send-PROH, I road lose-1-IRR:SG
‘Don’t send me, I’ll lose the road.’
Discontinuity of timeWhere one or both clauses are marked by adverbs of time, a disjunction of events is
implied, even where the pronominal reference for both events is identical. Again, there
are no explicit coordinators marking such predications; the relationship between the two
events must be inferred:

11.1.3Discontinuity of TAM markingWhere there is discontinuity of time (as in §11.1.2), there can also be an accompanying
discontinuity in TAM marking between the two verbs of the construction. The semantic
inference to be drawn in such cases is not different from the inferences we saw in (363)
and (364). In the following examples, the first verb is marked for realis or past, and the
second verb for irrealis:

s˙mba ts-ip-du

‘I haven’t slept (yet), I’ll sleep later.’
There are also cases of discontinuity in TAM marking which are not accompanied
by time adverbials – such often imply “condition” and will be dealt with next.
11.2Conditionals and concessivesIn a language like English, conditional and concessive clauses are subordinate, the
protasis and apodosis elements depending upon one another. In Kusunda, there is no
formal dependency marking – both verbs are fully finite – but there is an implied
semantic dependency.
Where the final (i.e. main) clause of a bi-clausal structure is marked for irrealis, it is
often implied that the first clause is a kind of conditional with the main clause its
apodosis. An exception to this is in a bi-clausal structure having the same properties but
with an explicit temporal specification on one clause. We saw such an example in (361),
where the semantic relationship is ‘after this… then that.’ Without the explicit adverbial
specification, however, the default relationship is a conditional one.
11.2.1Continuity of person in irrealis modeIrrealis marking on the final verb of a bi-clausal construction can occur with or
without person continuity between the two clauses. The result in both cases is the same
– it implies condition. The following example, then, a conditional, contrasts with the
examples shown in (365):
(366)11.2.2na t-˙m-da-n
t-o -da-k
this 1-eat-PL-REAL 1-die-PL-IRR
‘If we eat this we will die.’
Discontinuity of person in irrealis modeDisjunction of person in irrealis contexts for bi-clausal constructions can occur with
or without continuity in the TAM marking of the two verbs. In the following sections
we present both types.
11.2.2.1 With continuity of TAM
We have numerous examples in our corpus in which both sides of a conditional
clause, the protasis and the apodosis, are marked for irrealis. We have already seen in
§11.2 that the final clause of a conditional construction must be marked irrealis, and it is
not at all surprising that in a language for which irrealis marking is available, the protasis
side of the conditional should also be marked irrealis. (The surprising thing is that
irrealis marking is not always required on the protasis, a matter that we will discuss in
136Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3

‘If it rains tomorrow I won’t go.’11.2.2.2 With discontinuity of TAM
In conditional constructions it is also possible that the protasis side of the construction
be marked for realis, replacing the expected irrealis. Here we get a disjunction of TAM
marking, as in the following:
(368)a. goraq
ta≥
g-iw-˙n

kæ˙≥-g-u
2-eat-NEG:REAL cold-3-IRR:SG
‘If you don’t drink it, it will get cold.’
It is not known how the semantic interpretation of the sentences in (368) should
differ from those in (367). Some kind of evidential might be implied here. For
example, it might be that with realis marking in the protasis the speaker is stating
something about general knowledge – “If you don’t drink the tea, it will get cold” – or
even about his level of commitment to the outcome – “If it rains tomorrow (and I expect
it to do so), I will not go.” In any event, it is likely that the speaker is more strongly
committed to the possibility that the event in the first clause, though conditional, will
actually occur – something similar to the differences reflected in the English saying
“Not if, but when!” With irrealis in the conditional, nothing is certain, and the speaker
makes no commitment about the outcome.
11.2.3A concessiveThe concessive in Kusunda is no more than a conditional with implied contraexpectation between the protasis and the apodosis, as in the following:
(369)nu t˙n-da
pumba-n-u

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
11.3Bi-clausal residueThere are other bi-clausal constructions in Kusunda in which one or both clauses are
bounded by a suffix -da. -Da appears to be a subordinator and may, in fact, make
explicit some of the dependency relationships we have already discussed. On the other
hand, it may be that the -da here is no more than the same “incompletive” aspectual
marker -da we saw in §5.5.3.6. We have one example in which only the medial verb is
marked by -da, and the translation given to us was a time adverbial, as in:
(370)tsi ts-ip-ßn-da
n˙ti aoda d˙i-˙n
1-sleep-REAL-ADV who door knock-REAL
I
‘While I was sleeping someone knocked at the door.’In other cases, both verbs are marked by -da. Here, -da may be an irrealis subordination
marker. We saw earlier, under section §11.2.2.2 Discontinuity of TAM that a bi-clausal
construction with a subjunctive for the first clause can mark that clause as realis – a
seeming contradiction of terms (see 367). The difficulty is resolved if the subjunctive is
marked as an add-on category, a notion superimposed upon the “lower level” TAM
marking which is relevant to individual clauses. Thus:
(371)a. gina hul-˙n-da
tok t-˙m-da-k-da
he
cook-NEUT-SUB we 1-eat-PL-IRR-SUB
‘If he cooks we will eat.’
OR ‘If he had cooked we would have eaten.’ (??)
b. ta≥
g-iw-˙n-da
tsi sowa-t-ßn-da
I bathe-1-REAL-SUB
water 3-go-REAL-SUB
‘If it had rained I would have bathed.’It appears that the difference between the (a) and (b) sentences in (371) is the TAM
of the main verb – in (a) it is irrealis and in (b) it is realis. This has direct bearing on the
overall interpretation, a future subjunctive in (a) versus a past subjunctive in (b).
There must certainly be many more co-subordinate and co-ranking constructions in
Kusunda, but for the time being, those reported in §10 and §11 are all that our current
data base will support. This is a topic that clearly needs more study.","[131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138]"
"Tense-aspect-modality (TAM)For most verbs in Kusunda there is, what appears to be, a three-way tense distinction
– past, present, and future. By contrast, and central to our understanding of the three-way
distinction, however, Class I verbs have only a two-way distinction. Past and present
time are generally grouped together into a “realis” mode, and its opposite, “irrealis,”
marks future time and possibility. Realis, in some cases, however, can also occur with
future events, especially where certainty is high; such events are “perceptually located in
the real world” (Elliott 2000). Elliott claims that this is the case for a number of
Australian languages; “tense does not necessarily reflect reality status” (Elliott 2000:68).
Evidence suggests that the realis–irrealis distinction is older and more primary than
the so-called a “past–present–future” distinction. In fact, past tense (see Table 3)
appears to be only an added category; it occupies some of the same semantic space as
realis (see §5.5.4 on Negation) and, more significantly, its absence does not constitute a
“present” tense (indicated by the “strike through” in Table 3). Rather, the absence of
“past” is only realis. The major difference between past and realis is that past has an
unequivocal past–completive reading, while realis is used more frequently in utterances
with a kind of “neutral” or “timeless” sense, as in the verb ‘build’ in the following
sentences:
(168)a. pyana

Past–present–future in Kusunda, then, is only the fiction of a three-way division.
The real distinction is past–realis–irrealis. Thus, in Table 3, Class I verbs are those with
a two-way distinction, and Class II verbs add a further distinction for a total of three.

Class IITable 3. TWO-WAY CLASS I DISTINCTION, AND THREE-WAY CLASS II DISTINCTION
From Table 3 we see that both verb classes mark future and unrealized (irrealis)
events with -u / -k, and realis events with -n. Class II verbs, in addition, mark past
completive events with -i (singular) or -ei (plural).
The realis form is partially compatible with future time adverbials, although not in
independent utterances as in (169a). It can be used, however, with future time adverbials
in what appears to be a kind of neutral, timeless sense, as in (169b):
(169)a. *goraq

b. t˙~în

‘Today I build a house, tomorrow I sleep.’Irrealis, on the other hand, is fully compatible with future time. Thus, it can occur
with future time adverbials, or with present time adverbials extendable to a future reading,
as in the following:
(170)a. goraq
tsi t -a -an

‘Tomorrow I will go.’
b. d˙baq tsi t -a -an

‘I will go now.’ (‘I haven’t started yet, but I’m ready to go.’)Irrealis is not compatible with past time, (unless it occurs with incompletive -da, in
which case it carries a sense of ‘would have’ or ‘was about to’ – see §5.5.3.6). Its
incompatibility with past time adverbials is illustrated in the following example:
(171)*pyana

*yesterday I 1-go-IRR
*‘Yesterday I will go.’

"Transitive imperativesTransitive imperatives are much more regular than their intransitive counterparts.
Most transitive imperatives are fashioned after the imperative of the verb ‘to make, to
do,’ whose root form is ˙- or a-. The morpheme ˙-go transfers across to (almost) all
transitive imperatives, as in the following sample:
(198)a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.

‘Beat him!’
‘Find it!’
‘Cut it!’
‘Show it!’
‘Roast it!’
‘Send it!’
‘Boil it!’
‘Buy it!’
‘Carry it!’
‘Sew it!’Because most transitive verbs take the syntactic form of a “light verb” (i.e. some
nominal notion plus the semantically empty verb ‘to do’), many such verbs are intransitive
in force, as in the following:
(199)a.
b.
c.

nikæe ˙-go
lol˙ ˙-go
ya≥ ˙-go
an ˙-go‘Think!’
‘Laugh!’
‘Cry out!’
‘Defecate!’
‘Urinate!’An exception to the generalization that transitive imperatives are fashioned after the
verb ‘to do’ is in the case of Class I verbs – those with prefixed person marking. In
such cases the imperative verb is conjugated for second person. This phenomenon is
77Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
much more common in intransitive verbs, as can be seen in §5.5.6.1. We have a single
example in transitive verbs:
(200)
5.5.6.n-ukan2 9‘Know it!’ / ‘Figure it out!’ProhibitivesProhibitives, both transitive and intransitive, are marked by the suffix -in (allomorphs
-en, -˙n, -yin) following the verb root. As with imperatives, most (but not all) transitive
prohibitives are built on the prohibitive form of the verb ‘to do, make’ – ˙-yin ‘Don’t do
it!’ Following are examples:

‘Don’t allow it!’
‘Don’t cut it!’
‘Don’t show it!’
‘Don’t roast it!’Intransitive and transitive Class I prohibitivesIntransitive prohibitives and Class I prohibitives are simpler than those illustrated in
(201) in that they occur without the “helping” verb ‘to do, make.’ In addition, with
Class I verbs (see (202–203)), the root is preceded by the second person pronominal
prefix n-. (Note that the pronominal prefix also occurs potentially on transitive imperatives,
though only a single example has been found – ‘Know it!’ (see (200).)

29This form is identical with second person realis n-uk-an (2-know-REAL). First person realis is
t-ukan, and third person ukan-dzi.","[77, 78]"
"Negative irrealisNegative irrealis-assertion is marked by a suffix -wa, as in (188) and (189) below.
This -wa is very likely related to the negative -u discussed immediately above. Negative
irrealis-assertions can arise either from low probability or, in the case of first person,
from refusal, as in the following examples:
(188)CLASS I:a. tsi ts-ip-wa
I 1-sleep-NEG:IRR
‘I won’t sleep.’
b. tsi t-˙m-wa
I 1-eat-NEG:IRR
‘I won’t eat it.’
(189)CLASS II:a. tsi a-d-u-wa
I make-1-IRR-NEG
‘I won’t make it.’

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
b. nu a-n-u-wa
you make-2-IRR-NEG
‘You won’t make it.’
It should be mentioned that the irrealis negative morpheme -wa is often contracted to
-u, sometimes giving rise to potential ambiguities, as in:
(190)a. tsi t-ug-u
I 1-come-IRR
‘I will go.’b. tsi t-ug-u
< t-ug-wa
I 1-come-NEG:IRR
‘I won’t go.’There is also a possibility that -wa is a bimorphemic sequence (< *-u-a), with -u the
negative, and -a some, as yet, undiscovered morpheme. Recall that historically *-u has
been posited as the negative morpheme in (187) (see the discussion surrounding those
examples).
• Refusal. Negatives with a strong component of “refusal” sometimes mark the
pronoun twice on the verb – the old prefixed form and a newer suffixed form, as in:
(191)5.5.4.5.tsi t-˙m-wa-tsi
I 1-eat-NEG:IRR-1
‘I won’t eat it.’
Negative perfectAnother aspectual category is the negative perfect, translated as ‘not yet.’ It is
formed by suffixing a pronominal copy at the end of the realis negative verb, as in:
(192)a. tsi t-˙m-daÚ u-tsi
I 1-eat-REAL:NEG-1S
‘I haven’t eaten yet.’
b. tok t-˙m-daÚ u-tok
we 1-eat-REAL:NEG-1P
‘We haven’t eaten yet.’
c. nu n-˙m-daÚ u-nu
you 2-eat-REAL:NEG-2S
‘You haven’t eaten yet.’The same construction can also convey a sense of negative habitual:
(193)5.5.5.numba amba t-˙m-daÚ u-tok
cow
meat 1-eat-REAL:NEG-1P
‘We don’t eat cow meat.’
ImperativesThere are a large number of irregular, suppletive forms for marking the imperative,
especially in old, high frequency verbs (e.g. see (197)), and each has to be learned
separately. Still, most verbs follow regular patterns and we will deal with those first.

8.1.2In Class II transitive verbsClass II transitive verbs, too, for the most part, can occur in a neutral form. This is
especially true if the verb root ends in a consonant, as in:
(289)a. tok kæaidzi dza -˙n ts-i-da-n
we food
buy-NEUT 1-go-PL-REAL
‘We went to buy food.’
t-ug-un
b. tsi amba hab-˙n
I meat roast-NEUT 1-come-REAL
‘I came to roast meat.’
ts-i-d˙-i
c. amba pad-˙n
meat hunt-NEUT 1-go-PL-HORT
‘Let’s go hunting (for animals).’In these Class II transitive verbs, it is difficult to know if the so-called neutral forms
are only contracted third person realis forms – ˙-g-˙n (do-3-REAL) > -˙n. Many third
person realis forms, pronounced simply as -˙n by Kamala, are pronounced -˙g˙n by
Gyani Maiya. The third person -g tends to surface more readily in open syllable roots:
(290)t-ug-un
kæaidzi ai-g-˙n
food
beg-3-REAL 1-come-REAL
‘I came to beg for food.’Forms like the one in (290) are problematic in that they use a third person form in
the complement (‘to beg’), a form technically incompatible with first person in the
matrix verb (‘I came’). Thus, although forms like ai-g-˙n, too, are neutral or generic in
function, we will reserve the label “neutral” to those forms that are without third person
marking (as in (289)); especially where the form is incompatible with third person. (For
less finite forms for some of these verbs see §8.2.2.)
8.1.3In Class I verbsClass I verbs are the least amenable to non-finite conjugation for the simple reason
that such verbs normally include a prefixed person marker. In such cases, a third person
form is used (somewhat analogous to the form in (290) in which third person seems to
be understood as generic, as in:
(291)8.1.4g-˙m-˙n
kæaidzi
3-eat-REAL food
‘eaten food’ / ‘food eaten by (someone)’
Bare roots (concatenative structures)There are a few verbs for which only the bare root occurs in neutral constructions,
without the final -n, in a concatenative structure. This possibility is apparently lexically
determined and is not available for all verbs:
(292)kola t-ug-un
a. ta≥
water draw 1-come-REAL
‘I came to draw water.’107Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Morphology of subordinate structures
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
t-˙m-du
b. hol
cook 1-eat-IRR:SG
‘I’ll cook and eat.’
In a sense, all Class II transitives modelled after the verb ‘to do’ are a special case of
bare-root neutral verbs (i.e. “non-inflecting verbs”) – here followed by a conjugated
form of the verb ‘to make, to do.’ Following is an example of a typical Class II verb:
(293)8.2qaÚi
u-g-i
ip˙n suml˙
wind come-3-PAST corn break
‘Wind comes and breaks the corn.’˙-g˙-n-dzi
do-3-REAL-TAM (?)Embedded structures marked by -daThere are several subordinate clause types – like the purposive, the desiderative, and
non-implicative causatives – that are marked by the suffix -da on the embedded verb.
We will refer to this morpheme as the “purposive” <PURP> morpheme. This -da may
be related to the verb ‘go,’ in which case it would be analogous to purposive constructions
in some TB languages, as in the following Kham example:
(294)≥aÚ zya-na ≥a-hu-ke
I
eat-GO 1-come-PFV
‘I came to eat.’An alternative is to identify -da with the object marker -da. (Ultimately, of course,
the two may be etymologically related, the object marker itself having derived from ‘go,’
not unusual in the world’s languages.) Interestingly, -da does not occur on relatives, but
is exclusive to complements, and it is in these kinds of contexts that -da ‘go’ begins to
specialize as -da ‘object.’
8.2.1Non-finite forms marked by -daSome types of subordinate clauses are marked by the purposive morpheme -da
suffixed to the non-finite, bare root of the embedded verb. The -da suffix, however,
occurs in this “pure” form (we will see modified forms later) on Class I verbs (i.e.
those with potential prefixed person marking), and only after the person marking prefix
has been stripped away (an exception is given in §8.2.2). Thus, the verb ‘to sleep,’ for
example, occurs in its inflected forms with prefixed person marking – ts-ip-ßn ‘I sleep’;
n-ip-ßn ‘You sleep’; g-ip-ßn ‘He sleeps.’ In the non-finite -da structure, however, only
the bare root ip- occurs with -da suffixed:
(295)t-ug-un
a. tsi ip-da

‘I came to sleep.’

b. nu ip-da

d. no-k
kæaidzi hul-ak

cook-IRR we-PL eat-PURP 1-come-PL-IRR
you-PL food
‘If you cook the food, we’ll come to eat it.’The important thing to notice in examples (295) and (296) is that the embedded verb
occurs without person agreement prefixes, and that -da occurs invariant, as -da throughout.
Both of these points will contrast with “inflected -da structures” in §8.2.3.
The bare root forms for these Class I verbs are the same suppletive forms we saw
earlier in §5.5.5.1 (Irregular and suppletive forms). ‘To drink’ is another such verb:
(297)8.2.2tsya qon-da
t -a -an
tea drink-PURP 1-go-IRR:SG
‘I will go to drink tea.’
Non-finite Class II verbs marked by -daRecall from §8.1.2 that the -˙n “neutral” forms for Class II transitive verbs may, in
fact, be generic third person forms whose full form is -˙g˙n. For at least some verbs of
that class there is also a suppletive form of the verb which combines with -da to form a
non-finite structure. The transitive verb par excellence ‘to do, make’ is one such verb.
Where the inflected forms of the verb are a-d-i ‘I made’; a-n-i ‘You made’; ˙-g-˙n ‘He
made’; the non-finite form is ˙n- as follows:
(298)˙n-da
o~ ˆ la-t-ßn
a. tsi wi
I house make-PURP want-1-REAL
‘I want to build a house.’
t˙mb˙-d-i
b. kam ˙n-da
work do-PURP send-1-PAST
‘I sent him to do work.’Likewise, there is also a less finite structure for the verb ‘to beg’ than the one
illustrated in example (290) of §8.1.2. It is as follows:
(299)8.2.3ai-da
t-ug-un
beg-PURP 1-come-REAL
‘I came to beg.’
Inflected forms marked by -daThe forms in this section will contrast with those described in §8.2.1. Furthermore,
the structures described in this section are available to both Class I and Class II verbs.
109Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Morphology of subordinate structures

• On Class I verbs. The embedded verbs that we saw in §8.2.1 can also appear in
their person-inflected forms. There is no apparent difference in meaning (though there
certainly may be subtle differences). In such cases, the purposive morpheme -da
participates in a person agreement paradigm, such that -d-a marks first person environments
and -n-a marks second person environments. Third person reverts back to -da (there is
no -g-a). Thus, this form contrasts with the uninflected -da forms in the following way:
(300)UNINFLECTED -DA:a. tsi am-da
t-ug-un
I eat-PURP 1-come-REAL
‘I came to eat.’
INFLECTED -DA:b. tsi t-˙m-d-a

‘I came to eat.’

‘You came to eat.’
u-g-i
d. gina g-˙m-da
he 3-eat-PURP come-3-PAST
‘He came to eat.’
In (300b) and (300c) the purposive marker is no longer simply -da, as we had in
§8.2.1 and also in (300a). Rather, the forms are inflected for first and second persons –
-d-a and -n-a, respectively. Also, the form of the embedded verb includes prefixed
person markers – t-, n-, and g-.
The paradigms for these verbs are irregular, as is generally true for all Class I verbs.
Thus, the third person form of ‘eat’ includes a third person prefix g-. With the verb ‘to
sleep,’ however, such a form is disallowed. We get ip-da but not *g-ip-da. With the
verb ‘to fetch, get’ there is no first, second, third person inflection for the purposive
morpheme -da. Rather, all forms take the second person -na form of the purposive and
a third person g- prefix on the verb stem irregardless of person:
(301)a. g-i-na
t-ug-un
3-fetch-PURP
1-come-REAL
‘I came to get (it).’
b. g-i-na
n-ug-un
3-fetch-PURP
2-come-REAL
‘You came to get (it).’
c. g-i-na
u-g-i
3-fetch-PURP
2-come-REAL
‘He came to get (it).’That g- is a person prefix can be seen in the following inflections: ts-i-di ‘I fetched
it’; n-i-di ‘You fetched it’; g-i-di ‘He fetched it.’
Some Class I verbs have suppletive roots that are used with the -da construction.
The verb ‘to go’ is one of them. (302a) shows the base form as a benchmark, and
(302b) shows the suppletive form:
110Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3

there 1-go-REAL
‘I went there.’
b. sape ts-i-da
odoq
there 1-go-PURP neg.equative
‘I wouldn’t go there.’• On Class II verbs. To our knowledge, the -da structure in Class II verbs is
always an “inflected -da,” i.e. the morpheme has different representations for first,
second, and third persons. (An exception can be found in §8.2.2.) Here, a third person
-g-a is also possible:
(303)t-ug-un
a. tsi amba hul˙-d-a
I

‘I came to cook meat.’

‘You came to cook meat.’
u-g-i
c. gina
amba hul˙-g-a
he/she meat cook-3-PURP come-3-PAST
‘He/she came to cook meat.’Recall that in Class II verbs the suffix -d is almost always a marker of first person,
contrasting with second person -n and third person -g. In Class I verbs, the -d that
occurs in an identical phonological sequence is not the same -d, but part of the following
morpheme. So far, we have seen the following distinctions:
(304)8.3CLASS I:CLASS II:-di‘past’-da‘plural’-du‘irrealis’-da‘purposive’-d-i

‘first person–plural’
‘second person ‘plural’
‘first person–irrealis’
‘second person–irrealis’
‘first person–purposive’
‘second person–purposive’Finite embedded structuresMany constructions whose embedded verb can be marked by a neutral, non-finite
form, or marked by -da, can also be marked as finite. Thus, the following (a) and (b)
sentences contrast in form, but we are unaware of any semantic differences:
(305)a. tsi wi

For some verbs, especially Class II transitives, there are three contrasing forms, as in
the following:
(306)a. kæaidzi hab˙-˙n

‘I came to cook food.’
b. kæaidzi hab˙-d-a

‘I came to cook food.’
c. kæaidzi hab˙-d-ßn
t-ug-un
food
cook-1-REAL 1-come-REAL
‘I came to cook food.’ / ‘I cooked food and came.’There are limits on the finiteness of the subordinated verb. In general, the more
finite the embedded verb, the greater the likelihood that two different events are being
coded. The sentence in (306c), for example, could also be interpreted to mean ‘I cooked
food and came.’ Based on the same principle, the embedded verb in some constructions
must be marked with the same TAM as the matrix verb. Both verbs convey the same
event:
(307)a. wi
a-t-ßn
tumb˙-d-ßn
house make-1-REAL finish-1-REAL
‘I finished building the house.’
b. wi

‘I finished building the house.’
c. *wi
a-t-ßn
tumb˙-d-i
*house make-1-REAL finish-1-PASTWe will deal more with the specifics of TAM interplay when we deal with specific
constructions in §9, and in §10 on co-subordinate structures.
8.4Embedded structures marked by mutationWe have noted already that mutation is a grammatical “mark” in Kusunda. (See
§5.5.3.1, §5.5.4.3, and fn. 25.) Here we see that the mark applies not only to the marked
member of the realis–irrealis dichotomy, but also the marked member of the independent–subordinate dichotomy. In the following examples, the mutated variants of n˙g˙n
and ts˙g˙n do not indicate irrealis, but subordination:

"Negative realis in mutating verbsAll mutating verbs belong to Class I, i.e. person marking indices are prefixed to the
verb root. (But not all Class I verbs are mutating.) Significantly, negative realis in
mutating verbs employs mutation as part of its marking strategy, and the negative suffix
-u is added to the mutated root. Thus, both irrealis and negative are marked/mutated
patterns.

‘You are going.’c. NEGATIVE
¯-a -u > [¯-aÚ -u]
2-go:IRR-NEG
‘You did not go.’Here we encounter a few clues about the composition of the more elaborate negative
suffixes. The most basic (and probably original) negative marker is a simple -u suffix
added to the marked form of a mutating verb – yielding -a)-u (as in 187a, c) and
phonetically yielding [-aÚ -u]. (See also Negative indefinite pronouns under §5.1.3.)
Next, in Class II verbs, the slightly elongated form -aÚu follows person markers
yielding sequences like -d-aÚu for first person, -n-aÚu for second person, and -g-aÚu
for third person. Finally, in non-mutating Class I verbs, the modern realis negative
marker includes -d as part of the negative sequence – -daÚu for all persons (as in
185a–f). Mutation is part of the history of negation and occurs in both the simple and
in the more elaborated forms of the morpheme.2 7
Following is a negative–realis paradigm for mutating verbs (illustrating the simplest
of the negative suffixes):27See footnote 26.",[73]
"NegationThere are two negation patterns – one for realis and another for irrealis. In Class II
verbs the distinction between past and realis is neutralized in the negative, i.e. past does
not have a negation pattern distinct from realis. This lends support to our earlier
hypothesis that realis and irrealis are the original and basic distinctions in Kusunda,
while past is a later development.
71Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
It also becomes more clear under negation that the distinction between realis and
irrealis is, in fact, not related to “real” and “not real,” but is more closely related to
“actual” and “possible.” Thus realis affirmative statements assert something to be
factual, and irrealis affirmative statements assert something to be possibly true. In the
negative, “realis” asserts as true that something did not happen (or is not happening),
while irrealis asserts that even possible truth is not likely to become fact.
5.5.4.1.","[71, 72]"
"Negative realis in Class II verbsNegative realis-assertion is marked by a suffix -aÚu, with pharyngealization on the
first vowel and falling–rising pitch on the full sequence.2 6 (See also §6.1.2.2 Negative
existential.)
As in the affirmative, the affixation type of person markers (i.e. prefixing or suffixing)
affects other affixation patterns as well. Thus, recall from (153–155) that with fully
contrastive prefixed person markers in the affirmative (Class I verbs) the only distinction
marked by suffixes is the number distinction. The suffix -du, then, marks singular
actant for first, second, and third persons, while -dak marks plural actants. In Class II
verbs -d is separated off as a first person marker.
In Class II negative verbs, too, -d (along with -n and -g) belongs to the person
marking system and not to the negative suffix. Note, too, that in the negative there is no
marking in the verb to distinguish between singular and plural actants. Such information
is signalled by the free pronoun. Following is a Class II negative–realis paradigm:

"The velar and uvular seriesThere are difficulties inherent in distinguishing the velar and uvular series of consonants,
and for that reason they will be discussed together. As with consonants in the apical
series, absolute points of articulation may vary slightly from one word to the next
according to the vowels which follow. Thus, for example, the phoneme /k/ can have
pre-velar and post-velar variants depending on whether the associated vowel is high-front
or low-back.
Though there is good evidence for a contrast between velar and uvular consonants,
we have often found it difficult to distinguish between a post-velar [ßk] and a uvular [q],
especially because they commonly occur in identical contexts. Fortunately, the task of
distinguishing velar and uvular points of articulation is simplified in voiced consonants –
primarily because of the concomitant features of pharyngealization and lowering of
fundamental frequencies in the uvular series (see §4.3.2).
There may be an aspirate series for uvular consonants, but we have so far been
unable to distinguish it clearly from a fricative series:37Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Phonology

final. By contrast, the velar nasal consonant [≥] occurs only syllable finally. In this
respect, Kusunda differs noticeably from Tibeto-Burman languages in which nasal [≥] is
very common syllable initially. No word in Kusunda that we have found begins with
nasal [≥]. Following are examples of [k], [g], and [≥] in various contexts:

in many contexts, to be a fricative [x] also occurs with equal frequency as an aspirate

"AdjectivesLike Indo-Aryan, but unlike Tibeto-Burman, Kusunda has a distinct “adjective”
class. That is, the property notions of “size,” “shape,” “color,” etc., form an inherent
class of words not derived from other word classes (as with the class of stative verbs in
TB). This does not mean, of course, that the class of adjectives in Kusunda matches the
class of adjectives in any other language. There are several words that occur as adjectives
in English, for example, that occur as verbs in Kusunda. ‘Fat,’ for example, is a verb in
Kusunda, but an adjective in English. (See also §9.1.4 for derived Adjectivals.)
Adjectives in Kusunda, when occurring in a modifying function, precede the noun
they modify, and in a predicative function they occur with the existential copula tsu (or
kæaÚu, its negative counterpart). Following are examples:
(137)MODIFICATION:a. huigin ta≥

‘It’s not good for you to do this work.’
We spent very little time studying adjectives, and may encounter surprises in a later
study. One thing that did catch our attention was the paucity of basic color terms –
black, white, and red. Even the simplest TB systems have a four-term system – black,
white, red, and green. Still, black, white, and red are the colors predicted by Berlin and
Kay’s (1969) study for a three-term system.
Yellow and green are also possible in Kusunda, but only as secondary innovations.
Yellow, as in some of the TB languages of the region,2 3 is based on the color of tumeric
powder. The Kusunda word for tumeric is k˙p˙≥, and ‘yellow’ is k˙p˙≥ b˙yo. The
58Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
word b˙yo is similar to the Nepali bæ˙yo ‘became,’ but we have found it in no other
contexts.
Our informants, for several weeks, claimed that Kusunda had no word for ‘green.’
Eventually, they produced the word h˙rgun, which appears to be related to Nepali
h˙riyo. The likelihood of this being true is more convincing in the light of a second
word for ‘red’ – kæ˙rgun – based on a Kham corruption of the Nepali word for ‘rust.’
In Kham the word for ‘reddish-brown’ is kæ˙iryaso ‘rust-like.’ The words h˙r-gun and
kæ˙r-gun, then, may mean something like ‘har-like’ (from Nepali ‘green’) and ‘kæ˙r-like’
(from Kham ‘reddish-brown’). The words for ‘black’ and ‘white’ respectively are
soksodi ~ soksog˙r˙m and kasige.
The Kusunda word for ‘bad’ stands out as unique in the languages of the region.
In both IA and TB, ‘bad’ is commonly expressed only as NEG-good. In Kusunda,
‘bad’ qolom is a separate lexical item from ‘good’ wey˙n.
Most verbs, too, can be used in a modifying function. For a treatment of these, see
§9.1 on Adnominals and relative clauses.

"Prefixing patterns (Class I)Verbs are marked for the person (first, second, or third) and number (singular or
plural) of the subject argument. There is no object agreement. Person and number are
separate indices. Class I verbs are defined as those in which person is marked by
prefixes and number is marked by suffixes.
The underlying syllable shape of the verb root appears to have at least some bearing

on affixation type. The prefixing pattern occurs primarily, but not exclusively, on verb
roots that begin in a vowel, and the suffixing pattern occurs primarily on verb roots that
begin in a consonant. Thus, the (a) forms in (139) and (140) illustrate the rule, and the
(b) forms illustrate the exception:

is indicated by a suffix -da immediately following the root. Following are examples of
all persons and all numbers for ‘eat,’ ‘sleep,’ ‘come,’ and ‘go’ in realis mode:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The verbs ‘eat’ and ‘sleep’ are the most regular of the four verbs shown in (141)
and will serve as our starting point. The first element, a prefix, is t-/ts-, n-, or gaccording to whether the actant is first, second, or third person, respectively. The forms
are clearly based on the shape of the free pronouns tsi ‘I,’ nu ‘you,’ and gina ‘he, she,
it.’ The determination of first person ts- vs. t- is purely lexical and cannot be determined
by rule – phonological, grammatical, or otherwise.
Other Class I verbs with first person ts- are the following: ts-oˆ-˙n ‘I drank,’
ts-o)-on ‘I put,’ etc. Other Class I verbs with first person t- are the following:
t-o)-˙n ‘I died,’ t-uk-an ‘I knew,’ etc.
With the third verb, ‘come,’ the pronominal agreement forms are t-, n-, or Ø, and
with the final verb, ‘go,’ the forms are ts-, n-, and (seemingly) d-. In the latter case,
however, though d- possibly fills a person slot in the synchronic grammar, historically it
is the first element of the root and still surfaces in certain forms like the imperative – da
‘Go!’ D- as a third person marker, then, can be discounted on historical grounds.
Again, as in first person ts- vs. t-, the determination of third person g- vs. Ø is lexical
and cannot be determined by rule. Other Class I verbs with third person Ø- are the
following: o)-˙n ‘he died,’ uk-an-dzi ‘he knows,’ etc. Many others take g-.
Class I verbs are generally messy, with many irregular and suppletive forms. This is
very likely a consequence of their considerable age and maintained by high frequency

usage. A case in point are the plural forms for ‘go’ – ts-i÷-da-n ‘I went’ and n-i÷-da-n
‘You went.’ The vocalism [i] in the plural root [i÷] cannot be explained in the synchronic
grammar and nothing of the original root da remains. We end up with a suppletive
form.2 4
Another irregular verb is the verb ‘sit,’ with first person s-, second person ¯-, and
third person h-, as in the following:

also in the imperative, as in: h~aˆ-no ‘Sit!’

"Nouns and noun morphologyAll nouns in Kusunda, as far as we currently know, have the same morphosyntactic
properties. The class is composed of prototypical nouns, concrete kinds of things that
can be manipulated and counted. Though they can be counted, none of them can be
pluralized. There is no nominal plural marker. This sets them apart from pronouns,
which we saw in §5.1.
Another class of words that might be called “nominal” (though not so in this
grammar) are “action nouns.” This is a highly restricted class and occurs only in
constructions as a complement of the verb ‘to do’ – notions like ‘to do thinking’ or ‘to
do hitting.’ More than half of the verbs in Kusunda are formed from such elements.
Rather than referring to them as “nouns” in light verb constructions, however, we will
refer to them as “non-inflecting verbs.” They require the presence of an auxiliary verb
‘to do, make’ to carry the appropriate inflection. More investigation needs to be done
on their properties. (See §6.1.4.)
In §5.2.2.3 we give some evidence, still weak, for a possible “locational” subclass
of nouns.

9.1.2Non-finite adnominals formed from verbsIn non-finite (or “neutral”) adnominals, the embedded verb has no person inflection,
but does have what appears to be a realis marker -˙n. As in §8.1.1, however, we will
gloss the marker as <NEUT> for “neutral” (recognizing too that it may be a nominalization
or a true morphological participle). The following two forms we have seen before in
non-embedded structures:
(311)a. tul-ßn
p˙idzi
wear-NEUT cloth
‘worn clothes’
b. dza -˙n tsya
buy-NEUT tea
‘purchased tea’The verb form in (311a) occurs on a Class II intransitive, a verb type that is inherently
bereft of person marking (see §8.1.1). Person marking is not deleted to create a neutral
form. The form in (311b), however, occurs on a Class II transitive verb, a verb type that
inherently includes person marking. Its lack is a kind of deletion. Notice, too, that the
lack (or deletion) of subject person marking in transitive verbs, as in (311b), yields a
result semantically equivalent to a passive participle.
9.1.2.1‘Passive participles’Earlier (§7.2.1 and §7.2.2), we saw an anti-causative derivation for some transitive
verbs, marked by a suffix -q or -t. For such verbs, then, a construction semantically
equivalent to a “passive participle” is available (in which detransitivization is also
marked), as in:
(312)a. k˙la-q-ßn
k˙re
break-AC-NEUT jug
‘broken jug’
b. gwi-t-ßn
dimi
gather-AC-NEUT smoke
‘accumulated soot’This derivation, however, appears to be unavailable for many transitive verbs, and it is
precisely in these verbs that the deletion of third person affixes from “neutral” forms is
significant (see §8.1.1 and §9.1.2). In the section on phonology, especially §4.4.4.1, we
noted the tendency in Kamala of using third person verb forms -˙n (REAL) or -˙i (PAST)
where Gyani Maiya uses -˙g-˙n ( 3-REAL) or -˙g-i ( 3-PAST), respectively. Third person
-g is missing.
The possibility exists that Kamala is reacting to the lack of a semantic equivalent for
a passive participle in some transitive forms, and is in the process of creating a new one
by the deletion of third person – what we refer to in this grammar as “neutral.” A past
neutral form also occurs, as in:
(313)a. REALIS:

b. PAST:

‘roasted meat’< hab˙-g-i
roast-3-PASTIn §8.1.3 we noted that Class I verbs are not as vulnerable to the erosion of third
person markers as Class II verbs for the simple reason that they occur as prefixes.
There, third person forms are commonly used in a generic sense. The difference
between a generic and specific sense seems to lie with the presence of a free pronoun:
(314)a. SPECIFIC:
gina
g-˙m-˙n
kæaidzi n-˙m-du?
2-eat-IRR:SG
he/she 3-eat-REAL food
‘Will you eat food eaten (defiled) by him?’
b. GENERIC:
g-˙m-˙n
kæaidzi n-˙m-du?
3-eat-REAL food
2-eat-IRR:SG
‘Will you eat eaten (defiled) food?’In Gyani Maiya’s speech, the same principle seems to hold for Class II verbs. In
Kamala’s speech, there may be a detransitivization of generic transitive forms, or there
may be an erosion of her phonology.
9.1.2.2Levels of transitivity in adnominal modifiersThere can be various levels of transitivity in adnominals derived from verbs. The
most transitive are those with fully finite transitive verbs (315e), and the least transitive
are those with Class II intransitive verbs where S equals O (315a). (Not all transitive
verbs have a Class II intransitive counterpart as the following verb does.) It will be
easier to describe transitivity levels (a), (b), and (c) by using Nepali equivalents in
addition to English. We begin with the least transitive:
(315)a. yo-˙n
amba
cook-REAL meat
‘cooked meat’ / Nep. ‘pakeko masu’ (intransitive)
b. hol-di

Nep. ‘p˙kaeko masu’ (transitive)

‘cooked meat’ / ‘meat cooked by someone’ / ‘meat cooked by
him’115Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Syntax of subordinate structures
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
e. hul˙-d-ßn
amba
cook-1-REAL meat
‘meat that I cooked’
The verb in (315a) is a suppletive intransitive form of the verb ‘to cook’ and always
implies intransitivity with S equalling O. The -di form in (315b) is an adjectival form
that is available to only a few transitive verbs. The form in (315c) is a neutral form, used
primarily by Kamala and derived from an earlier third person generic form. It is
transitive, but with no agent in view. The third person generic form is given in (315d).
It can also be a specific third person form. The form in (315e) is a first person form
which is never used in a generic sense, and implies full transitivity.
It is instructive to contrast the ‘cook’ verb above with another verb whose intransitive
semantics implies that S equals A. The Kusunda verb for ‘hide’ is such a verb.
Furthermore, the inherent form of the verb is intransitive. (For ‘cook’ there are two
inherent forms – an intransitive yo- and a transitive hol-.) With ‘hide,’ because S equals
A, the intransitive adnominal must modify an animate noun, as in:
(316)a. hyoq-ßn
amba
hide-REAL animal
‘hidden / hiding animal’
b. *hyoq-ßn
gimi
*hide-REAL moneyOur informants’ explanation for the ungrammaticality of (b) is “because money
cannot hide itself.” Thus, where there is no inherent O intransitive verb, the passive
adnominal must be formed off the causativized version of the verb, and the only “passive”
form available to such verbs is Kamala’s “neutral” form or Gyani Maiya’s “generic
third person” form:
(317)a. Kamala:
hyo -a-˙n
hide-CAUS-REAL
‘hidden money’gimi
moneyb. Gyani Maiya:
hyo -a-g-˙n
gimi
money
hide-CAUS-3-REAL
‘hidden money’ (by someone)
This contrasts sharply with those forms that are inherently transitive and are detransitivized by anti-causative derivation, like the forms in (312).
9.1.3Case recoverablility strategies for relative clausesAll relative clauses, whether they are “subject relative clauses” or “object relative
clauses,” are coded in the same ways – as neutral or as fully finite. There is no
morphological marker in the embedded verb to distinguish different types. Rather, the
distinction is based entirely on the identity of the role of the argument that occurs as the
head of the NP. Based on this criterion, we have at least three relative clause types in
our data set – a “subject relative clause,” an “object relative clause,” and a “locative
relative clause.”

AdjectivalsWe include adjectivals under Adnominals and relative clauses because of their close
formal similarity. Some intransitive and detransitivized verbs can form adjectives by the
suffix -di. The derivation, however, seems not to be available to all intransitive verbs, and
it is not yet known what the parameters are. We give the following examples:
(321)a. hab-di
roast-ADJ‘roasted’117Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Syntax of subordinate structures

open-AC-ADJ‘open’f. borlo-q-di
boil-AC-ADJ‘boiled’We have two examples of -di acting as a formative for nominalization:
(322)a. kila-di
steal-NML‘thief’b. sokso-di
black-NML‘black’Some intransitive verbs make use of a suffix -dzi for adjectivals. This is one of the
most puzzling suffixes we have encountered because of its occurrence in numerous and
varied contexts. Following are examples of its occurence in adjectival contexts:
(323)9.2a. o -dzi
die-ADJ‘dead’b. hyo-dzi
swell-ADJ‘swollen’c. qai-dzi
dry-ADJ‘dry’d. qau-dzi
spoil-ADJ‘spoiled, rotten’Periphrastic causativesIn addition to the morphological causative discussed in §7.1.1 and §7.1.2, Kusunda
also has at least two periphrastic causatives. As with universal expectations, the periphrastic
causative implies less direct causation than the morphological causative. One of the
Kusunda periphrastic causatives implies that the event coded in the embedded clause
already occurred; whereas we are unsure of the level of implicature in the second
causative type.
9.2.1Implicative causative – “make”The implicative causative is a complement verb structure whose matrix verb is the
verb ‘to make.’ The embedded verb is coded in much the same way as the clauses we
saw in §8.1 and §8.2 – either as “neutral” or finite (or as a mutating structure as we
saw in §8.4). There is, however, none of the -da encoding we saw on “purposive”
clauses. Following are neutral forms:

‘He made me build a house.’
b. gin-da limi-dzi
a-d-i
he-ACC dance-3:REAL make-1-PAST
‘I made him dance.’In an unexpected twist, the embedded form of “mutating” verbs (see §5.5.3.1) is
the irrealis form, something that needs to be accounted for (we broached this topic first
in §8.4). In Class II verbs, like the verb in (325a), the form of the embedded verb is
realis (which is what one would expect for an implicative verb). Irrealis would seem to
imply a non-implicative status for the embedded verb.
Earlier (see fn. 25, 26), we noted that the mutating pattern very likely originated in an
old “marked–unmarked” distinction and was later morphologized in various systems.
The marked modality is irrealis, the marked polarity is negative, and here, the marked
dependency is dependent. In the “permissive” construction (see §9.3.4) we will see the
pattern again.

in its literal sense. The embedding structure, however, is something we have not yet
encountered, and will not properly discuss until §10.1, and specifically in §10.2.5. We
introduce it here simply as an “overlapping converb.” Following are two examples:
(327)a. gina t˙n-da

b. nu gin-da

a-de
t˙mb˙-n-i
you him-ACC house make-CNV send-2-PAST
‘You got him to build a house.’
The causative use of ‘send’ contrasts with the literal sense of ‘send’ through the
complementation type used. With literal ‘send,’ the complement is cast as a “purposive”
clause, as in:
(328)tsi gin-da
am-da
I
him-ACC eat-PURP
‘I sent him to eat.’t˙mb˙-d-i
send-1-PASTThis latter sense of ‘send’ is non-implicative; it does not imply that the event named
by the embedded verb occurred.
9.3ComplementsThere are numerous verbs which are capable of supporting sentential complements
as an object (or destination) argument – ‘go/come for the purpose of,’ ‘want,’ ‘be able
to,’ ‘allow,’ ‘finish,’ ‘see/hear that,’ ‘think that,’ and ‘know how to.’
9.3.1PurposiveThe “purposive” clause is a complement to matrix verbs ‘go/come,’ or ‘send/bring.’
We have already seen numerous examples of this clause type when we illustrated the
morphology of -da in §8.2. The purposive can also be marked by “neutral” morphology
(see §8.1). Here we reiterate some of the examples used elsewhere:
(329)a. WITH GO:
tsya qon-da
t -a -an
tea drink-PURP 1-go-IRR:SG
‘I will go to drink tea.’
b. WITH COME:

2-come-REALc. WITH SEND:
gin-da kam ˙n-da
t˙mb˙-d-i
he-ACC work do-PURP send-1-PAST
‘I sent him to do work.’
9.3.2DesiderativeThe desiderative embeds complements to the matrix verb ‘to want.’ Literally, when
used with non-sentential arguments, the Kusunda verb means ‘to search for.’ As with
the purposive, complements of the desiderative can be marked “neutral” or with the
suffix -da:
(330)a. gina wi
˙g-˙n
~oˆ la-g-˙n
he
house make-REAL want-3-REAL
‘He wants to build a house.’

‘I want to build a house.’
c. tsi gin-da
p˙rm˙-da
~oˆ la-d-i
I
him-ACC meet-PURP want-1-PAST
‘I want/wanted to meet him.’
As in many other languages of the region, with ‘want’ the subject of matrix and
embedded clauses must be the same. Thus, it is not possible with this structure to say ‘I
want him to go’ – only ‘I want to go’ or ‘He wants to go.’
9.3.3AbilitiveThe verb ‘to be able’ is homophonous with the intransitive verb ‘to hide’; indeed, by
strange circumstances, it may be the same verb. The abilitive conjugates as an intransitive
verb. Syntactically, though, the verb allows a sentential complement marked either with
-da or as neutral, as in the following:
(331)a. tsi wi
˙n-da
I house make-PURP
‘I can build houses.’hyoq-tsi-n
able-1-REALb. t-˙m-˙n
hyoq-wa
1-eat-REAL
able-IRR:NEG
‘I can’t eat.’
c. tsi amba pad˙-n
I meat hunt-REAL
‘I can hunt animals.’hyoq-tsi-n
able-1-REAL• Opportunitive. A second “abilitive” construction contrasts with the one above in
§9.3.3. The former implies physical ability, whereas this one implies “finding
opportunity.” It uses the matrix verb ‘to find’:
(332)a. t -a -an
d~aba-d-aÚ i
1-go-SUBORD
find-1-NEG:REAL
‘I wasn’t able to go.’
b. t-˙m-˙n
d~aba-d-aÚ i
1-eat-REAL find-1-NEG:REAL
‘I wasn’t able to eat.’Notice that in (332a) that the mutating verb ‘go’ is marked by the mutated form of
‘go,’ indicating that it is subordinate. (See §8.4.)
9.3.4PermissiveThe permissive construction employs the matrix verb ‘to give.’ As in the other
complements we have seen, the embedded verb is marked by -da or as neutral:
(333)a. gina t˙n-da
wi
˙n-da
eg-i
he me-ACC house make-PURP give-3-PAST
‘He allowed me to build a house.’

‘He didn’t used to let me eat, now he lets me eat.’
As we saw earlier in §8.4, and also with the implicative causative in §9.2.1, this
construction casts embedded mutating verbs in the “marked” form (elsewhere, the
“irrealis”).
(334)a. t˙n-da
t -a -an
e-g-i
me-ACC 1-go-SUBORD give-3-PAST
‘He allowed me to go.’
b. t˙n-da
t -a -an
e-g-aÚ u
me-ACC 1-go-SUBORD give-3-PAST:NEG
‘He didn’t allow me to go.’9.3.5PreventativeThe preventative construction employs the causative of the verb ‘to stand,’ and
means ‘to stop someone doing something.’ Two separate events are coded, and both
are fully finite. Following are examples:
(335)a. g-˙m-˙n
dæoˆ -a-d-i
3-eat-REAL stand-CAUS-1-PAST
‘I stopped him eating.’
b. g-u-ya,
dæo ˆ-a-yin
3-come-OPT,
stand-CAUS-PROH
‘Let him come, don’t stop him.’9.3.6CompletiveThe completive matrix verb is the transitive verb ‘to finish.’ As far as we know, only
this complement structure requires both verbs (the matrix verb and the embedded verb)
to be coded in the same TAM. We repeat here example (177):
(336)a. wi
a-t-ßn
tumb˙-d-ßn
house make-1-REAL finish-1-REAL
‘I finished building the house.’
b. wi
a-d-i
tumb˙-d-i
house make-1-PAST finish-1-PAST
‘I finished building the house.’
c. *wi
a-t-ßn
tumb˙-d-i
*house make-1-REAL finish-1-PAST9.3.7See and hearThe verbs ‘see’ and ‘hear’ regularly support complements in which the embedded
clause is a separate, autonomous event from the matrix verb event. Not surprisingly,
both verbs are marked as fully finite, each of them expressing person–number and TAM
specifications for the immediate clause only. Following are examples:122Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
(337)a. tsi-gimtsi wi

wi
a-t-ßn
g-~aÚ-dzi
1S-friend
me-ACC house make-1-REAL 3-see-TAM (?)
‘My friend saw me building a house.’
In (337a) the main clause event is ‘I saw,’ while the embedded event is ‘He builds a
house.’ Likewise, in (337b) the main clause event is ‘He saw,’ while the embedded
event is ‘I build a house.’ The events are entirely autonomous. The same holds for the
verb ‘hear,’ as in the following:
(338)a. tsi wa
t-ug-un
m˙b˙-g-i
I home 1-come-REAL hear-3-PAST
‘He heard me coming home.’
b. loÚl˙-g-i
m˙b˙-d-i

‘I heard him cry out.’9.3.8ThinkThe verb ‘think’ in Kusunda also means ‘to remember,’ as in tsi n˙n-da imba-d-i (I
you-ACC think-1-PAST) ‘I remembered you.’ We have only one example of the verb
with a sentential complement:
(339)tsi da≥
t -a -an
imba-d-i
I
Dang 1-go-SUBORD think-1-PAST
I think I will go to Dang.’Notice that here, too, like we saw in (329) and (334), the embedded “mutating” verb
‘go’ takes the marked case.
9.3.9Know howThe verb ‘to know’ in Kusunda expresses the notion of ‘how to do something’ and
can include abstractions like gina gip˙n uk-an-dzi (he language know-REAL-<??>) ‘He
knows Kusunda (= He knows how to speak Kusunda)’. Knowing a person employs a
different verb tsirma- ‘recognize,’ which is used as a matrix verb for ‘believe.’ (See
§9.3.10.)
In our corpus of data we have only cases in which both the matrix verb ‘know’ and
the embedded complement verb are coded as realis:
(340)a. tsi wi
a-t-ßn
t-uk-an
I house make-1-REAL 1-know-REAL
‘I know how to build a house.’
b. nu wi

and [≥]. We have already commented that velar and uvular points of articulation are
more easily distinguished in the voiced series for the simple reason that voiced uvular
consonants are accompanied by other phonetic indicators – pharyngealization and a
lowering of fundamental frequencies on preceding vowels.
As far as we can tell, no word begins with [ ], though numerous words begin with
[q]. [G] occurs as an interovcalic phenomenon. This fact by itself would lead us to
believe that [q] and [ ] are in complementary distribution. There are, however, cases of
[q] also occurring intervocalically, as in the following contrastive pair:
(69)a. [yaqa]
b. [ya o]‘porcupine’
‘cold (weather)’The problem we run into here is similar to the problem we have seen with other
consonants – voiceless consonants, intervocalically, frequently surface as voiced sounds
(see §4.4.1). With labial consonants we were able to say that intervocalic [b] is an
underlying [p], and intervocalic [∏] is an underlying [b]. The solution is not so simple
here. [G], in our data, never surfaces as an actual stop. Rather, it is sometimes
articulated with a certain amount of fricativization, as in [Ù], but more often as a pharyngealized approximant [ ].
In our early transcriptions, we wrote [ ] as [h] or [÷];1 2 later we began to realize that
the sound had an anticipatory “glottal” or “pharyngeal” quality, and we experimented
with [h] preceded by pharyngealization on the vowel. As we collected more data we
began to detect distinct pharyngeal stricture during the production of the consonant, and
though the sound is phonetically closer to [ ] than anything else, we are interpreting the
sound, within the larger system, as [ ]. The caveat is that cardinal [ ] does not occur,
and we will write the sound in our text examples as / /, (indicating pharyngealization,
realized especially on the preceding vowel).
• A test for distinguishing [q] from [)] in some contexts. If we are correct in
asserting that anticipatory pharyngealization on vowels is a feature that accompanies
voiced uvulars ([ ], [ˆ]), and not voiceless ones ([q]), pharyngealization will be a useful
diagnostic for distinguishing [q] from [ ] in certain contexts. In the following examples,
pharyngealization makes the difference between two otherwise similar sequences:
(70)a. [okti]
b. [o tsi]‘medicine’
‘chest’(71)a. [aqa]
b. [a k˙]‘below’
‘above’12In Reinhard and Toba’s transcription (1970), many of our [ ]s are transcribed as [÷].","[39, 40]"

also marks “dative recipient” in bitransitive clauses and the subject in “dative subject”
clauses. The grammatical category, then, marks the “terminus” of a causal chain, and
might be better termed an “endpoint.” Following are examples of both:
(114)DATIVE RECIPIENT:a. gina-Ø

‘To me drinking tea is tasty.’
Note that the verb form in (114a) is identical to the form in (113d) even though one
functions in a transitive clause and the other in a bitransitive clause. (114a) adds a
“secondary object” letter, and -da marks the animate “primary object,” a notional
indirect object (Dryer 1986).
In (114b–c), -da marks the “dative subject,” a well established pattern both in
Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman languages of the region (with the exception of Kham,
one of Kusunda’s immediate neighbors). Reinhard and Toba show this structure
without a dative subject.
It is not known what semantic or pragmatic parameters delimit the use of -da in
transitive clauses, but it is clear that animacy plays a big role. We have numerous cases
of inanimate objects being unmarked, as in:
(115)a. tsi wi
a-t-ßn
I house make-1-REAL
‘I built a house’ / ‘I make houses.’
b. gina ta≥

same morpheme -da also marks embedded clauses of purpose (glossed in the examples
52Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
as PURP). Here too, the “endpoint” of the eventuality named by the matrix verb is the
semantic notion being marked. The embedded verb retains many of its finite features,
and will be treated more fully in §8.2.3. In the meantime, we present the following
examples:
(116)a. t-˙m-da
t-ug-un

‘I came to eat.’
b. tsi wi
˙n-da
ol~aˆ -t-ßn
I house make-PURP want-1-REAL
‘I want to build a house.’From the example in (116a) it is clear that the matrix verb need not be transitive to
warrant the felicitous use of -da. It is likely that the marker is more attuned to the
pragmatic notion of “endpoint” or “goal” than it is to the syntactic notion of transitive
“object.” Throughout this grammar we will continue to gloss -da as ACC, DAT, or
PURP, depending on its usage.
5.2.2.3.","[51, 52, 53]"
"Intransitive imperativeThe regular marker for the imperative in intransitive verbs is the suffix -to, varying
75Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
with -do. In fact, the suffix occurs also with verbs that one would expect to be transitive.
Following are examples of -to (-do) on intransitive verbs:
(194)a. ip-to
b. o -do
c. bem-to
d. hyoq-to
e. b˙l-to
f. limi-to
g. dzoq-to

‘Dress (yourself)!’
‘Enter!’
‘Jump!’
‘Lie down!’
‘Play!’
‘Get up!’
‘Stand!’
‘Squat!’
‘Weep!’
‘Drop!’
‘Fly!’• Nasal allomorph -no. Where the verb root ends in a uvular nasal consonant, the
form of the imperative is -no, as in the following:
(195)a. h~aˆ -no
b. g~aˆ -no‘Sit!’
‘Look!’Some verbs which seem to be transitive in force also take the intransitive imperative
marker (as in (195b) ‘look’). Another such verb is ‘to climb, mount,’ as in soq-to
‘Climb!’ In the case frame of this verb, however, the thing climbed is marked for
locative case, not as an object, as in:
(196)tsi-h~ukui-da
yi-g˙
soq-indzi
1S-child-ACC
tree-ON climb-let
‘Let my child climb in the tree.’Another two verbs that are transitive in force but intransitive in morphology are the
verbs ‘to beg,’ the imperative of which is – ai-to ‘Beg!’ – and ‘to fight.’ In both cases,
the notional object is marked with the comitative morpheme: ‘to beg with someone’ and
‘to fight with someone.’ Apparently, verbs without a fully affected object are both
semantically and morphologically “less than transitive” (Hopper & Thompson 1980).
Other verbs which might be expected to take transitive morphology are the verbs ‘to
eat’ and ‘to wait.’ Their imperatives, however, are formed by -to: am-to2 8 ‘Eat!’ and
¯aq-to ‘Wait!’ It may be that these two verbs are ambitransitive, though we lack the data
to make that claim. More difficult verbs to “explain” are kham-to ‘Bite!’ and o)-to
‘Set it aside!’28The imperative of ‘eat’ is also am, a bare root without affixation.","[75, 76]"
"The laminal seriesLaminal consonants are formed by the blade of the tongue against the palate, in
contrast to the tip of the tongue in apical consonants. Apart from the palatal glide or
semi-vowel /y/ (see §4.4.5), the only laminal consonants are /¯/ and /t /, both somewhat
difficult to justify. As we have just seen in example (53), [¯] can occur as a variant of
/n/, but there are some minimal environments that dispose us to treat it as a separate
phoneme. One such environment is where it “harmonizes” with a following uvular
cosonant, as in:
(55)a. [¯~aˆdi]
b. [¯aqtsin]‘wife’
‘I wait.’Though it might be possible to write the laminal as a simple /n/ and rely on the
following uvular consonant to trigger the appropriate variant [¯], the fact is that in certain
grammatical environments the palatalization of both ‘n’ and ‘ts’ is part of a larger
autosegmental “mark” that spreads vocalic and consonantal harmony across the entire
word. Thus, in the following example, [n˙g˙n] and [¯a an] are realis and irrealis forms,
respectively, of the same verb, as are also [ts˙g˙n] and [t a an], as in:
(56)a. [n˙g˙n]
b. [¯a an]‘You went.’
‘You will go.’c. [ts˙g˙n]
d. [t a an]‘I went.’
‘I will go.’The phoneme [¯] also occurs in at least one environment where it is unpredictable
and contrasts with [n], as in:
(57)a. [na]
b. [¯~aÚ ˙di]‘this’
‘I removed it’This particular contrast is somewhat suspect and may, in fact, turn out to be [¯~aˆ
˙di].

7.2.3.2A “functional” passiveIn §8.1 we will discuss verbs that occur without person marking – our so-called

– person marking occurs as a prefix. In such cases, the most neutral inflection is a
generic third person prefix (see §8.1.3), as in the following verb used in a modifying
function:
(282)g-˙m-˙n
kæaidzi
3-eat-REAL food
‘eaten food’ / ‘food eaten by (someone)’In like manner, independent verbs in coordinate structures (see §11.1) can be interpreted
as having passive force where the medial “passive” verb is inflected as a generic third
person and the final verb is specific for person, as in:
(283)pyana
hul˙-g-˙n,
t˙~îna t-˙m-˙n
yesterday cook-3-REAL, today 1-eat-REAL
‘Yesterday it was cooked, today I’ll eat it.’Many third person realis forms, pronounced as -˙g˙n by Gyani Maiya, are pronounced
simply as -˙n by Kamala, as in (284). (On this topic see also sections §4.4.4.1,
examples (63–64), and §9.1.2,1.)
(284)7.3pyana
hul˙-n,
t˙~îna t-˙m-˙n
yesterday cook-REAL, today 1-eat-REAL
‘Yesterday it was cooked, today I’ll eat it.’ReflexiveThe reflexive construction in Kusunda does not require detransitivizing morphology
in the verb, but relies on the reflexive pronoun gimdzi ‘self.’ The reciprocal uses the
same mechanism, but with two occurrences of the reflexive pronoun, as in:

‘They killed each other.’This is not to say that detransitivized constructions are not compatible with the
reflexive pronoun; they are. If, however, the speaker wishes to express that the agent
acted on him/herself, the construction requires a fully transitive verb, as in the examples
of (285). Used with intransitive constructions, inherent or derived, the reflexive pronoun
only signifies that the eventuality named by the verb happened without outside agency
(not that it acted upon itself):
(286)ANTICAUSATIVE WITHOUT REFLEXIVE PRONOUN:a. gagri pæiru-t-ßn

"IncompletiveAnother aspect, marked by -da, collocates with both realis and irrealis modalities.
(See also §11.3.) We have not yet determined all the variables, but tentatively we have
glossed it as a kind of incompletive (or imperfective). In realis mode, -da yields a kind
of “past imperfective,” or “past continuous” sense with habitual overtones, as in the
following:70Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3

‘While I was sleeping, someone knocked on the door.’The same -da, used with irrealis, yields a reading of ‘would have,’ or ‘was about to,’
both senses compatible with non-fact modality. Following are examples:

‘We would have slept.’
b. nu e-n-u-da

‘That person was about to fall.’Other verbs that behave the same way are ip-dzi-da ‘was about to sleep,’ and

“imminent” aspect illustrated in §5.5.3.5.

"‘I went.’‘You went.’‘You are going.’Non-mutating Class I verbsIn contrast to the mutating Class I verbs, the realis–irrealis distinction in the majority
of Class I verbs is marked by affixation patterns. Following are examples of irrealis
forms marked by the affixes -du (for singular) and -dak (for plural):
(174)REALISIRREALISa. t-˙m-˙n
1-eat-SG:REAL
‘I ate.’t-˙m-du
1-eat-SG:IRR
‘I will eat.’25Whatever the original function of ‘mutation’ may have been, it shows evidence of having later
been morphologized to operate in several grammatical systems, not restricted to the realis–irrealis
distinction alone. In some transitivity diathesis alternations, for example, the marked parameter is
marked by mutation, as in: dzu≥-dzi ‘It hangs’ vs. mutated dzoˆ-a-dzi ‘He hung it.’ See also sections
§8.4, §9.2.1, §9.3.4, and §9.3.8 for the ‘mutating’ pattern in subordination.
Though such marking systems are rare in the languages of the world, similar phenomena have
been reported in isolated cases. Jim Watters (1987) reports that in Tlachichilco Tepehua, a Totonacan
language of Mexico, second person subject agreement in verbs is marked by glottalizing all glottalizable
consonants – p, t, ts, ch, k, and q become p’, t’, ts’, ch’, k’, and , respectively.",[68]
"Local case markersIn our data set, only three locative case markers have emerged. Reinhard and Toba
list more, though some of them are suspect. The so-called “preposition” inside, for
example, given as gem˙t, is very likely the word for ‘stomach.’2 1
None of the locative case markers appear to be obligatory, especially if the semantic
connection is sufficiently understood by the collocation of the verb and the locational
noun. This may constitute some evidence for a separate “locational” subclass of nouns
(see §5.2).
(117)a. goraq
tsi da≥
t -a -an
tomorrow I
Dang 1-go-IRR
‘Tomorrow I will go to Dang.’
b. dzæola g-o -on
bag
3-put-REAL
‘He put it in the bag.’• The locative -da. The marker -da, discussed in §5.2.2.2 as an accusative, marks
at least one other kind of relationship, a locative one. The marker occurs rarely, but
seems to occur almost obligatorily on the word for ‘road’2 2 and also commonly on the
word for ‘forest.’
(118)a. un-da
myaq
p˙rm˙-d-i
qæai-tsi-n
road-LOC leopard meet-1-PAST afraid-1-REAL
‘I met a leopard on the road and was frightened.’21The word for stomach can, of course, serve as a ‘relator noun’ for inside in the same way that
the word for buttocks in our data serves as a relator noun for behind. Very likely it is a kind of noun.
See §5.3.
22It appears possible that the frequent combination un ‘road’ and -da ‘locative’ may be the source
for the verb ‘to show’ unda a-d-i [show do-1-PAST] ‘I showed it.’53Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes

Notice that in (118b), -da occurs twice. In its second occurrence it marks what
appears to be an inanimate object – ‘road.’ In fact, we are interpreting it as a locative
marker. Recall that -da is obligatory on most occurrences of ‘road.’
Comparing locative -da with locative -ga (following), the distinction may be that -da
marks distal, diffuse locations, while -ga marks nearby, specific locations.
• The locative -ga/-g˙. The locative marker -ga appears to mark a nearby, specific
location, and will be glossed IN, as in the following:

‘Come out of the house!’

responds with our data.
House, as a destination or location, has its own special suppletive form which
incorporates location – wa. This contrasts with the nominative form wi. Reinhard and
Toba (1970) list ‘to the house’ as w˙haa.

‘I put it in the house.’• The allative. The form given in (121) for house, wa, may include the vestige of
an old allative marker -a. The allative appears to be no longer productive, but occurs
also in the following:
(122)5.2.2.4.a~o-a
sip-tsi-n
inside-ALLT enter-1-REAL
‘I entered (to) inside.’
Other case markersHere we will treat a few nominal suffixes that do not neatly fall into the grammatical
or locative class of markers. They are: the “comitative,” the “benefactive,” the “comparative,” and the “instrumental.”
• The comitative. The comitative marks a notion of association, or doing an action
with another actant, as in the following:
(123)gina-ma
tsi ts-˙g-˙n
1-go-REAL
he-WITH I
‘I went with him.’As in most other languages of the region, the comitative also marks possession, as in
‘With me is one rupee’ meaning ‘I have one rupee.’
(124)tsi-ma
qasti tsi/tsu
I-WITH one is
‘I have one.’ (lit. ‘with me is one’)The language is ambivalent in how it interprets -ma. As a location, it collocates with
the locational copula tsi. As a possessive, it collocates with the existential copula tsu.
In “reciprocal” kinds of verbs, -ma marks the reciprocal actant. Such verbs, morphologically, behave like intransitives, as in:
(125)tsi gina-ma
limu-tsi-n
fight-1-REAL
I
he-WITH
‘I fought with him.’There is at least one bitransitive verb in Kusunda in which -ma marks the “source.”
55Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes

The verb is ‘beg,’ as in:
(126)tsi-ma
gimi
ai-dzi
d-˙g-˙i
I-WITH money beg-3:PAST 3-go-PAST
‘He begged money from me and left.’ (lit. ‘with me’)• The “benefactive”. What we refer to here as the “benefactive” is a case marker
that occurs on NPs without concomitant valence adjusting modifications on the verb.
For details on the latter kind of benefactive construction, see §10.2.3. Here, the benefactive
case marker is based on the Nepali ko lagi, as in the following:
(127)tsi-lage limu-dzi
I-FOR fight-3:PAST
‘He fought for me.’• Comparative. The comparative in Kusunda is based on the Nepali bæ˙nda, as in
the following:
(128)na bæ˙nda ~oˆ ˙n o -da-n
this than
big
come-PL-REAL
‘Bigger than this come.’ (in reference to mosquitos)• Instrumental. It seems strange that we have been unable to elicit an instrumental
marker. All attempts have yielded nothing. Reinhard and Toba list a morpheme -ya as
the instrumental. Following is an example of the lack of an instrumental:
(129)na kæurpa-Ø kis˙-g-˙n
this knife
cut-3-REAL
‘This is cut by a knife.’ / ‘(He) cut this with a knife.’(See §8.1 for the “neutral” conjugation of this verb – something that yields an
intransitive reading.)
5.3.","[53, 54, 55, 56]"
"The genitiveThe genitive suffix -yi/-ye (allomorph -i/-e following consonants) occurs primarily
on possessive pronouns (see §5.1.1) or on third person possessors in a possessor–possessee relationship. First or second person possession is marked primarily by possessive
prefixes. Following are examples of third person possession:
(108)a. ram-e
Ram-GENag˙i
dog‘Ram’s dog’b. twi-ye
bee-GENgida≥
water‘bee’s honey’There are numerous other cases in which the possessive relationship is not marked
at all, especially in “part–whole” constructions. Thus, though ‘honey’ is marked for
possession in (108b), the semantically similar “body part relationships” are not generally
marked, as in:
(109)a. ata
mouth
b. i≥
eyegida≥
watergida≥
water‘saliva’
‘tears’What might be termed as “type relationships” are sometimes marked by the genitive,
sometimes not. We do not know if the choice is lexically determined or determined by
pragmatic notions like “degree or level of semantic union.” In the following examples,
the first is marked by the genitive, the second two are not.

c. qotu

semantic relationships between nouns, like “composed of” or “location of,” as shown
in the following examples:
(111)a. ye≥gu wi
stone house‘stone house’b. duga ab˙q
ground vegetable‘mushroom’The genitive is also used in first or second person possession where a modifier
occurs between the possessor and the possessed item, as in (112b):
(112)a. tsi-wi
1S-house
b. tsi-yiye≥gu
1S-GEN stone5.2.2.2.‘my house’
wi
house‘my stone house’The nominative and the accusativeSituated in a sea of ergative marking languages, Kusunda, with its nominative-accusative
case marking system, stands out as a typological island. In Kusunda, there is no
distinction between transitive and intransitive subjects – both are zero marked. Nor is
there a marking distinction between third and non-third persons in transitive clauses (as
in “person-based” split ergatives), or between “more transitive” and “less transitive”
clauses (as in “volitionality” systems, or “stative-active” systems, or “aspectually-split”
systems). All of these ergative or ergative-variant systems occur in the languages of the
region, but, as far as we can tell, Kusunda has no ergative of any kind.
The nominative argument in Kusunda is zero marked (unmarked), and the accusative
is marked by the nominal suffix -da. Following are examples of nominative and
accusative marking in intransitive and transitive clauses:
(113)a. tsi-Ø
limi-t-ßn
I-NOM dance-1-REAL
‘I danced.’
b. gina-Ø u-g-˙n
he-NOM come-3-REAL
‘He came.’
c. pyana
tsi-Ø n˙n-da
imba-d-i
yesterday I-NOM you-ACC think-1-PAST
‘Yesterday I thought about you.’20The Kusunda genitive -yi/-y e looks a lot like the Kham genitive -yi/-y e, which has been related
by some to Tibetan -ki (DeLancey 1984). The -gi here seems to point to the same etymon. Without
further study we do not know under what conditions the genitive surfaces and -yi, and under what
conditions as -gi.","[50, 51]"
"Person marking in verbsPerson agreement patterns in the Kusunda verb are of two basic types, a prefixing
pattern and a suffixing pattern. The prefixing pattern occurs with a limited set of “high
frequency” verbs – verbs like ‘come,’ ‘go,’ ‘eat,’ and ‘sleep’ – and appears to be the
older of the two patterns. The suffixing pattern is modeled closely on the conjugational
pattern of the verb ‘to do,’ and has every appearance of being, or having developed on
an analogy with, “light verb” constructions – constructions like ‘to do hunting,’ ‘to do
breaking,’ or ‘to do thinking.’ More than half the verbs in Kusunda take this form and
we will present them as “non-inflecting verbs,” all inflection being carried by the
auxiliary ‘to do, make.’ It is impossible to speculate on the source of such verb roots
and whether they were inflecting at an earlier stage or not.

alveolar, palatal, retroflex, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal. Many of the points,
however, are non-contrastive, and there can be considerable variation even in single
words. What is more material for Kusunda, it seems, is to describe consonant sounds in
terms of their active articulator – labial, apical, laminal, velar, and uvular. An apical
consonant, for example, can be dental, alveolar, or retroflex. The actual point of articulation
can be extremely variable; it is the articulator that counts as contrastive.
It appears that the original sound system of Kusunda may have been quite simple,
and that in relatively recent times, due to the influence of TB and IA, it has been gaining
in non-native features. The voicing opposition on consonants, for example, is still
marginal in many contexts; voicing originally being the unmarked norm. Aspiration
appears to be new, and many of the modern lexemes that utilize it can be traced to TB or
IA. Fricativization, apart from phonemic /s/ and allophonic variants of most stop consonants
([∏], [©], [Ô], and [≈]) is non-existent.","[30, 31]"
"Syntax of subordinate strucuturesIn this section we will look at individual grammatical categories – periphrastic causatives,
relative clauses, various complements, etc. – and explore the different ways in which they
can be encoded. Most have a one-to-many relationship, i.e. a single category can be
encoded in more than one way. In some cases, different encodings imply different
nuances of meaning, and in other cases we are unaware of any semantic differences.
9.1Adnominals and relative clausesKusunda has no relative pronouns. So-called “relative clauses” are composed of a
finite verb in adnominal function which modifies the following head noun, as in: ‘the
I-kicked-it ball’ in place of ‘the ball that I kicked.’ In other languages of the region,
both IA and TB, adnominals formed from verbs are typically nominalized structures.
Kusunda is exceptional in this respect and does not fit the areal typology. (Santali also,
apparently, has fully finite verbs used in modification (see Masica 1976:121).)
9.1.1Finite adnominals formed from verbsThe adnominal modifier in Kusunda utilizes at least two of the structures we saw in
§8 – they can be cast as “neutral,” or they can be fully finite. Neither appears to be a
nominalization (although the “neutral” form may, in fact, turn out to be a nominalization).
Though such adnominals are formed from verbs and are modifying in function, they
have no morphological form that can be said to be different from an ordinary finite verb
(and hence not strictly speaking ‘participles’) – they are fully inflected for person, and
can be TAM-marked either as realis or past tense. Following are examples of finite
verbs in past tense functioning as modifiers within relative clauses:
(309)a. hab˙-g-i
amba
roast-3-PAST meat
‘meat that he roasted’
b. na tsi d~aba-d-i
gimi,
n˙n-da
e-d-u-wa
this I find-1-PAST money, you-ACC give-1-IRR-NEG
‘This is money that I found, I will not give it to you.’Realis marked adnominals are similar in structure:
(310)a. tsi t-˙m-˙n
kæaidzi
I 1-eat-REAL food
‘food that I ate’
b. tsi e-d-ßn
gimi
hampe hur˙-n-i
I give-1-REAL money where throw-2-PAST
‘Where did you throw the money I gave you?’We have no examples of irrealis marked adnominals (though they may exist –
further research needs to be done here). Relative clauses, of course, are the locus of
presupposed propositions, and it would not be surprising to find a preponderance of
“factitive” verb forms coding them, i.e. those denoting established fact.",[113]
"Morphology of subordinate structuresClauses which are subordinated or embedded in other structures – adnominals in
relative clauses, sentential complements, periphrastic causatives, purposive clauses and
the like – are cast in one of three basic construction types. In one, the verb is cast in a
“neutral” non-finite form without person marking; in another, the subordinated verb
root is marked by a suffix -da; and in a third type the subordinate verb is fully finite.
None of the structures appear to have any kind of nominalizing morphology, although it
might be argued that the presence of -da is sufficient evidence to assume some kind of
nominalization – -da is also an NP object marker (see §5.2.2.2).3 3
Lack of nominalized structures makes Kusunda typologically exceptional. Languages
of the region, both Nepali and TB languages like Kham, nominalize all sorts of embedded
clauses, and in some TB languages there are multiple types of nominalization.
Here we will explore the basic morphological structure of subordinate structures and
talk later (in §9) about how they function within hosting structures. Though presented
from different points of view, there will necessarily be some overlap.
8.1Neutral formsWe will define a neutral form in Kusunda as having no person inflection. Such
forms are not “citation” forms, nor do they include any kind of nominalizing morphology
(unless, of course, the neutral form itself is a nominalized form). Neutral forms occur in
subordinated clause environments (or as modifiers) where person–number and tense–aspect specifications are not relevant – such specifications are marked in the matrix verb.
In Class I verbs neutral marking is not always possible, in which case -da marking is
still an available option (see §8.2.1).
8.1.1In Class II intransitive verbsOne verb type in which “no marking” is possible is in Class II intransitive verbs, as
described in §6.2.1. Recall that such verbs are bereft of person marking, a state of
affairs that is modified in finite contexts (see §6.2.2 for the modification), but which is
well suited for non-finite contexts. Such verbs are marked only with a suffix -n (variant
-˙n), which may or may not be the realis marker -n. Here we will gloss it <NEUT> for
“neutral,” as in the following:
(288)sip-ßn

nati (N)Origin mythsReinhard recorded a short Kusunda text, The Origin of the Kusunda, from a Kusunda
man named Tek Bahadur in central Nepal, and Reinhard and Toba provided a transcription
and translation of the text in their 1970 article. Our informants were unfamiliar with the
story, and could produce nothing analogous on their own. Yogendra Yadava did, however,
get them to orally translate the story back into Kusunda based on Reinhard and Toba’s
Nepali translation. As a translation, it lacks spontaneity.
According to the story, a king, the father of three sons, left his inheritance to the
17Watters: Kusunda Grammar; A socio-linguistic and anthropological profile
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
eldest son, who became king in his place. The son was unsuccessful in all that he did –
his crops failed and weeds grew in their place, and when milking his buffalo, it produced
blood in place of milk. He rubbed oil on its legs and a black man sprang out. The
second son confronted his older brother, telling him that because of his lack of success
he could no longer be king, and had to live in the forest, begging and hunting. The Ban
Raja are his descendants. The second son became king in his brother’s stead and was
successful in all that he did. The Thakuris are his descendants. One day the second son
wanted to do a special sacrifice that required the blood of a pig, but he could find no one
to kill it. The youngest son volunteered, and the Magars (who keep pigs) are his
descendants.
There are other origin myths as well, one of them involving Balmiki, a famous sage,
and the goddess Sita. This one, too, is reported by Reinhard (1976). According to the
story Sita asked Balmiki to watch her baby while she went to the river to wash. He
agreed, but when Sita returned Balmiki was deep in meditation. So as not to disturb
him, Sita quietly picked up the child and left. When Balmiki awoke, the baby was
missing, and he fashioned an identical baby for her out of kus grass. Later, she raised
both children as her own. The one made from kus grass, named Kusha, ruled over the
forests and became the father of the Kusundas. The first son ruled the cultivated lands
and became the father of the Thakuri.
Both myths make a deliberate connection between the Kusunda and the high caste
Thakuri. The linguistic evidence, of course, does not support such a claim, and to claim
a relationship with Thakuri (and hence to the king and the ruling class) is fairly common,
being made by several other aspiring tribes in Nepal as well. Interestingly, both myths
concede a lower status for Kusunda, the Kusundas being descended from the
“unsuccessful” son and the “imitation” son. The title “Ban Raja” concedes the same
– “the king is King of the Durbar, we are Kings of the Forest.”
