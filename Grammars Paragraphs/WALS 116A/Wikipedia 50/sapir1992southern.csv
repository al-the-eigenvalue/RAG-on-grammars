"§ 50. Postpositions.
Paiute possesses a large number of postpositions or, as one might
prefer to call them, non-syntactical case suffixes. They are chiefly,
but not entirely, of local reference. They are true suffixes (or compounded stems that have practically become suffixes), as shown by the
fact that they precede all enclitics and that, under appropriate
consonantal conditions, they are subject to the phonetic processes
of spirantization, gemination, and nasalization (e. g. -ruywa-, -tcuywa-,
-wtcuywa-, -tuywa-, -ntuywa- το). The position of the postposition
thus corresponds to that of the objective (§ 49). Postpositions are
suffixed to nouns, pronouns (except, of course, enclitic pronouns and
postnominal pronouns), and demonstrative stems (treated as the
equivalent of inanimate third personal pronouns).
( 1 ) T Y P E S OF POSTPOSITIONS.
Etymologically, three types may
be recognized. A considerable number consist of simple elements
that cannot be brought into connection with other Paiute elements,
e. g. -να -, -να- AT; -upa- THROUGH, IN — DIRECTION; -ma- WITH. Some
of these seem to go back to Uto-Aztekan prototypes; with -DO- cf.,
e. g., Nahuatl -pa. A number of simple postpositions seem to occur
only or chiefly as compounded with others, e. g. -yi-, -tjwi-, - aya-.
A second type of postposition is that compounded of two (or more)
postpositional elements. These may either be independently occurring elements (e. g. -vaywituywa- INTO < -var/wi-"" IN plus -tuywa- το)
or an independently occurring postposition preceded or followed by
one not so occurring (e. g. -φοϊ-tuywa- INTO; -aya-^oa-tcuywa- RIGHT
INTO; -ruqwa-yi- MOVING UNDER).
Several postpositions that now
appear primitive are quite probably really compounded of simpler
elements, e. g. -var/wi- IN < -va- AT + -ywi-.
A third type consists of originally independent stems, chiefly
adverbial and nominal, that are compounded in a postpositional
sense with preceding stems (cf. English AROUND, ASIDE FROM, APART
FROM, ALONG). Such compounds are often followed by a primitive
postposition, e. g. ni-ya""mya -va - I-SIDE-AT, AT MY SIDE < qa'ni'ya·SIDE. That -ya'mya -va - is a true compound postposition is shownX Southern Paiute and Ute
218SAPIRby its employment with a pronominal stem like rii-'\ a noun compound
ηϊ-ya'myais impossible. This type of postposition raises the
question whether all postpositions as a class are not in origin stereotyped compounded nouns (e. g. HOUSE- UNDER < HOUSE-UNDERNESS;
UNDER MY HOUSE =MY HOUSE-UNDERNESS).","[235, 236]"
"The Indians were living there on the mountain and the two Horsetail Hair brothers were living among them. Some of those who were
out hunting were killed by some people. The two brothers said,
""Claiming what for themselves 97 might be the persons who act in
t h a t way to my people? Let me, then, go off yonder to engage with
them."" The two Horse-tail Hair brothers started off and travelled
along in that direction. At yonder place where they were camping
over night they asked each other, "" W h a t have you ever dreamt?"" 9 8
said Horse-tail Hair, questioning his younger brother. "" I , indeed,

§ 34. Order of verbal elements.
At this point we may conveniently take up the question of the
order in which occur the various elements that build up a verb form.
Four main positions are to be recognized: prefix, verbal theme,
suffix (prevailingly formal in character), and enclitic. Each of these
positions may consist of more than one element. On the otherX Southern Paiute and Ute
170SAPIEhand, only the second position is necessarily filled, though ordinarily
one or more elements of the third position follow. The order of
elements within each of the four fundamental positions is, for the
most part, rigorously determined. Fifteen positions may be recognized within the third, though, needless to say, only a limited number
of combinations among these are intrinsically possible. The following
scheme will be useful for reference (the letters and numbers indicate
order of position):
A. Prefix
1. Adverbial prefix (§ 20)
2. Reflexive prefix (§ 22)
3. Instrumental prefix (§ 21)
B. Verbal theme
1. (a) Verb stem (or other stem if followed by Β 2); or (b) combination of stems, last of which is necessarily verbal (unless Β 2
follows) (§ 18, 2)>
2. Verbalizing suffix (§ 26)
C. Suffix
1. Suffixes of voice and aspect: -ya- (§ 30, 1); -yi- (§ 30, 2);
-qi- (§ 30,3); -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c); -wo- (§ 31, 2, b); -tea- (§ 31, 2, d)
2. -tcai- (§ 31, 2, a)
3. Causative -f-ui- (§ 29, 12)
4. Indirective (or transitivizing) -rjqi- (§ 29, 11)
5. Pluralizing suffixes: -qa- (§ 31, 1, c); -'ψνα- (§ 31, 1, a); -t-'i(§31, 1, b)
6. Suffixes of movement (§ 28); continuative -n'ni- (§ 30, 12)
7. Momentaneous suffixes: -iju- (§ 30, 5); -qu- (§ 30, 7)
8. Resultative -qai- (§ 30, 9); passive -t'i- (§ 29, 13)
9. Perfective -q ai- (§ 32, 3); usitative -mia-, -mi-n (§ 30, 10);
-ml- (§ 30, 13). -m i-"" precedes -q ai-.
10. Future -pa - (§ 32, 4), -pan-ia (§ 32, 5; -n-ia- probably best
considered as belonging to position 14)
1
A 2 (or A 3) + Β 1 (a) + Β 2 may, however, be taken as unit and compounded with preceding (non-verbal) or following (verbal) stem.
Indeed,
this extended verbal "" t h e m e "" m a y also include elements (chiefly 1 - 4 ) belonging to position C. It is difficult to give rules, as composition takes place
whenever two or more elements or groups of elements are felt as logically
combinable or psychologically equivalent. Composition thus s o m e w h a t
breaks in on our order scheme.","[186, 187, 188]"
"Bear Danceu4
In 1901 they had a bear-dance in the afternoon (5 to 6) about that time,
not as an important dance, but as a pleasure dance, just as they had foot
and horse races, wrestling, target-shooting. There is no particular leader
to a bear dance. About eight men sit down on the ground in a circle around
a dishpan (formerly a round basket) and play rasps which lie on the pan
nearly flat (only tilted to a slight angle), singing at the same time. The
singing starts in first as a sort of signal for the beginning of the dance.
Whoever wishes joins in; others may look on. The women gather on the
side away from the singers; the men are near the singers. The girls and
women advance towards the singers on the flat stomped-out dancing
ground in no regular line, and without keeping time to the music; then
each singles out a partner from the men by touching with a branch or
throwing a pebble. The woman then advances backwards followed at a
distance by the man she had picked out in time to the music; they may
thus advance and come back several times before joining in together. The
dancing parties do not keep in line, but each advances and steps back
regardless of the others. After a while (or immediately), they join, each
holding the right hand on the other's left shoulder and left hand behind
the waist. There seems to be no attempt to have the step (a sort of light
springy walk or semi-hop) keep in time to the singing and rasping; some
go fast, others slow. A song generally lasts from five to ten minutes. AfterKaibab Paiute EthnographicField Notes849a very short interval, the next is started; other parties now dance or the
same may dance again. The girls are supposed to represent the bears, the
men are the persons who dance with the bear women, according to the
myth. If one does not wish to follow the girl he is poked with a pole or
branch carried by one of the two or three officers (who may have appointed
themselves so or been agreed upon as such by the men, not the women)
and forced to follow. If one is not alert in following, it is believed that
when chased by a bear in the mountains, he will not get away easily;
otherwise he would. Many songs are sung. The last song is the longest,
lasting from about twenty to thirty minutes, and is called ""moving the
longest distance"" (miyotox mi4i')· If one of the members of a party gives
out, his or her place is taken immediately by a friend, a large number of
whom are ready. Both boy (man) and girl (woman) must not stop dancing
at the same time; the party as such must continue throughout. It generally
ends about sundown.
When Tony was about eight or nine, the Kaibabs returned from hunting
on the Kaibab Plateau to Kanab in the fall and were instructed in it by
Tom (then a young man of Cedar City Indians, who had been much with
the Utes; he now lives with the Kaibabs and is considered the best singer
of bear-dance songs, being generally the song-leader) and medicine-man
Mamputs of the Arizona Paiutes, who had traveled much among the
Southern Utes. Tom ordered six holes to be dug in a distance of about 20
feet and had cedar posts (about 10 feet high) erected; no explanation was
given of this fence and it has never been used since. Mamputs sang first
as leader, chiefly songs with words; then Tom followed, mostly with songs
without words, which are considered more difficult. One of his songs long
after, maybe composed by himself, is: ""Let us go back home, my friend,
we are traveling about just for fun."" Nowadays the bear dance is generally
sung in March, but sometimes also during the summer, whenever there is
a general gathering or ""good time.""
The Bear Dance takes place every spring, generally early in March. Two
lines are formed, one of men and one of women; the dance consists in the
moving of the two lines towards each other, stopping, then moving back,
and so on repeatedly. Six or eight men are used as singers of the Bear
Dance songs. These songs have Paiute words and seem to follow in a
certain order, each song consisting of a statement or of a question and
answer referring to some incident in the myth recounting the origin of the
Bear Dance. There must be several hundred of these songs; according to
Tony Tillohash, old men acquainted with all the songs would be able to
sing from nightfall to morning without duplicating songs. The singers in850X SouthernPaiute andUtethe dance accompany themselves with rasps, rubbing cylindrical pieces of
wood over long, somewhat oblong sticks serrated on one side with angular
notches. Different sized rasps could be used. To secure a sounding board,
a small pit is dug in the ground and a basket placed over it. The rasps rest
on this by an edge obliquely cut away at one end of the side opposite the
notches. The ceremony lasts four days.
In the Bear Dance, three officers are appointed with long pointed
sticks. If a man touched by a willow branch held by a girl refuses to
dance, he will not escape when chased by a grizzly bear. The dance is
supposed to give a person the power to escape from bears. The dance
consists in running back and forth, man with woman partner.
In the Bear Dance a man and woman faced each other with one hand
on the other's shoulder and the other hands clasped.145 The pair ran up
and down keeping together in this position.
The Bear Dance is important enough in itself to make different bands
come around to witness; generally it is held at the place where a
particular band camps. The Kaibabs have it every March when bears
come out of their dens; also the Arizona Paiutes have it; the Muddies
and St. Georges have seen it but do not perform it, not having good
bear-dance singers.146Rasps Used in the Bear Dance
Mampüts generally rasps one direction, towards himself, two beats
to each bar. Tom generally rasps four times to a bar, alternately towards
and away from himself, the main beat coming on the rasp beat towards
himself, with which he begins.
Before beginning to sing, it is customary to have one bar of rasping
(two ""towards"" beats with M., four beats with Tom); sometimes only
a bar is rasped. At the end of a song the rasp is played with four (or
five) rapid (twice as quick as before) strokes, the last being outward
and most accented. Raspers may follow either of two styles; they do
not all have to rasp in the same way.
uvwu tivun'
qamusaywÄyätsiYv Ant""
Alas (pity)! my friend having a jack-rabbit stomach!
These words are said when any one of the dancers falls down or
stumbles. One of the raspers, seeing him or her do so, jumps up andKaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes851quickly runs there, while rapidly rasping, and puts the rasp on his or
her back, keeping on rasping quickly.
The sound of the rasp can be heard as much as two or three miles
away on a quiet evening, the rasping carrying farther than the singing.
Each tries to sing as loud as he can; this is not true of cry songs. At
the end of a song, the rasps are held in the hand with the sticks; at the
end of the dance, the pan is put away where it belongs and the rasps
and sticks are put in the hole. The rasps are thrown away after the
ceremony.","[852, 853, 854, 855]"
"Several of these are used in idiomatic connections that do not readily
yield insight into their primary significance. I t is believed, however,
that the chief elements and uses are given below.
(a) -yainta-, -ayainta- TOO, ALSO. These elements always follow
pronominal enclitics, when present. The form -ayain ia- is probably
compounded of -a- (see 3, a below) and -yain ta-; it is not at all clear
how it differs in use or meaning from -yain• ια-.^γαϊη • ia- itself is perhaps
compounded of -πια- (see d below). Examples of -yainta- ALSO, TOO

Sometimes -{a)yaintarii'axainis elided to -(a)yain·, e. g.:y/tu'va n i I-too will-doA frequent modal use of -yainta- is to indicate a somewhat unexpected inference or an emphasis on an idea that might be questioned.

(c) -ywa- SHOULD, OUGHT. This enclitic is doubtless identical
with preterital -ywa- (1, b above). When used as modal enclitic of
obligation or in mild imperatives, it is followed by enclitic -noa- (see
e below). Examples are:

(d) -n ia- LIKE. This is one of the most constantly recurring
enclitics. Though its primary significance is that of resemblance,
it is employed in several fairly distinct nuances of meaning and
enters into many idiomatic turns of expression. Its primary meaning
is clearly illustrated in:
-ψΐί'ο ηπί naya'p a rjupiya' thus-again-like appeared, (it) looked just

Myths
The telling of myths should be stopped as early as spring, before the
Bear Dance in March takes place. 133844X SouthernPaiute andUteMyths were never told in summer, for then snakes would bite the
narrator. In winter myths were told, for there were no snakes about at
that time. Once a myth was started, it should be finished; otherwise the
winter would be lengthened, part of the summer becoming winter. A
favorite time of telling myths was in the evening when all had laid
themselves away to go to sleep. Some man, generally an elderly person,
would half-lie, half-sit with his head propped up by a log or mass of
blankets and tell myths far into the night. As he told it, the auditors
were expected to show their attention by comments (such as mym or
öwai' 'yes')> or by laughing at the humorous passages; if the full point
of any passage was not seen, it might be repeated, such repetitions often
stringing out a story beyond its proper length.
Gradually the auditors dozed off to sleep; it rarely happened that
most of them, particularly the children, were ""lucky"" enough to hear
the end of the stories. If the narrator found that no one responded to
his good points, he would suddenly stop and call out, ""Are you listening?"" and, if no one answered, he might wake up the people and
continue, except, of course, such as had asked to be allowed to go to
sleep on the plea of being tired.
The older Indians still believe these myths to be true. An anecdote is
related of a St. George Indian, who listened to the words of a white
preacher at the mission church as he told of the origins of things as
related in the Bible. After he had concluded, the Indian arose and told
his Indian friends, ""Now this man has finished telling you stories. Now
I am going to tell you Indian stories and true ones."" This anecdote was
related from place to place and considered a good joke on the white
man.
Myths, no matter how obscene, were told in the presence of women
and children. Nothing was thought of this.
Tony remembers having heard the following story narrated as true.
Somewhere northwest of the Kaibab Paiutes there lived two pretty
unmarried girls who were great friends. Once they went out far off from
the camp and sat down. One of them said, ""Let us do something."" The
other replied, ""What shall we do?"" The first said, ""Let us play with
each other. You lie down on your belly and I shall lie on top of you
like a man."" The other girl consented. The first girl then began to
copulate with her friend who found, to her astonishment and shame,
that she had a penis as well as female private parts. She was a hermaphrodite. She was so mortified that after that she had nothing more
to do with her former friend.","[847, 848]"
"TRANSLATION.24At that place people had a camp for the hunting of jack-rabbits;
Coyote was their chief. They hunted for jack-rabbits; and then a
thing fell down upon them as from the sky.
There, then, they all
gathered together. ""What is it?"" they said. And then Coyote said,
""This looks like fire, it is from far away from something burning.
That which we have been burning as fire is not real fire, and what
we eat we always eat raw. I t would be very good if we find out
whence this fire has come; it would be very good if what we eat were
cooked, it would be extremely good if we ate it,"" said Coyote. As
they were still gathered together there, Coyote said, ""Go ahead!
go over there in order to see whence came this which has fallen downTexts of the Kaibab Paiutes and Uintah Utes
TEXTS OF THE KAIBAB PAIUTES AND UINTAH UTES391from the sky."" To that one, Chicken Hawk, ""You are accustomed
to be flying about,"" said Coyote. ""Yes,"" said Chicken Hawk.
And then he flew up into the air. Then, having done so, off over
the earth he flew; then from a distance back hither to them he returned.
And then Coyote said, ""Go aheadl you Crow, fly up into the air.""
""Yes,"" said Crow; then off he flew. He went, and it happened to
him in like manner, over the earth he went and flew; from there he
also turned round hither, hither towards them, and he also arrived
where they were. All those provided with feathers were used up,
then only that Fish was left. Coyote said, ""Have you feathers, then,
so as to fly? Go ahead! try to fly,"" said Coyote to him. ""Yes,"" said
the Fish. Then up into the air he flew. Coyote said, ""Do you all
follow him with your eye!"" Those watched his flight closely, as
upward toward the sky he flew, then they lost sight of him. There,
then, they were waiting for him; then, after a while, he arrived.
""Hurry up and tell what you saw,"" said Coyote. ""Way off at the
edge of the land it looks as though fires were burning,"" said the Fish.
""What did I say?"" said Coyote. ""Let us go to fetch that fire from
those who are having it as fire. This of ours that we cause to burn is
no real fire,"" said Coyote. ""Yes,"" said they all. ""Let us, then, go to
fetch that fire.""
And then all started out towards the setting sun. Coyote led
them along; they stopped to camp over night while on their way.
At that place Coyote said, ""Go ahead! you Humming-bird, fly up
into the air, and then go and see that which is burning."" After he
had said it, that Humming-bird flew up into the air. Though having
done so, he did not see the (fire), and returned without result. Then
that Coyote said, ""Go ahead! you Fish, fly up again into the air.""
And then that Fish flew up into the air; then, after a while he came
back. Then that Fish said, ""Now it is near."" Then they started
off again; again they camped over night while on their way. Now that
camp was very near towards which they were going. And then
that Coyote said, ""All of you will arrive (and be) distributed in each
house. I for my part shall arrive and go into the chief's house.
And then you shall not eat all of what has been given to you,"" said
that Coyote, ""(but) shall put some of it in your knees. Then one
night we shall have a hand-game with them. I shall seize fire with
my hair with which this cedar-bark tinder of mine is tied; when
morning comes, I shall be signalling by leaning back and forth over
that fire, then you shall all be ready to start off."" ""All right,"" said
they.","[412, 413]"

Ghosts
If at night in the woods you keep whistling, the ghosts will come.
Various Indians claim to have seen ghosts. Once an Indian was riding
a horse on a trail through the woods and led another horse that followed
after. It was getting dark. Suddenly he heard a long melancholy howl
starting high and gradually falling. He listened, thinking it might be
someone in distress. The horses had been acting queer, moving their
ears uneasily. He heard the howl again, this time nearer. The horses
tried to shy away from the trail, the led horse having now sidled up to
the other. He knew something was up and suspected a ghost. He got
scared but kept up his courage. He continued to hear the howls, always
nearer and nearer. At last he saw a man appearing, walking through
the woods away from the trail. He looked like an old white man with
white hair, but was not recognized by the Indian. The Indian screwed
up his courage and hailed him, ""Where are you going, old man,""
thinking he might possibly be lost. He received no answer. He asked
several times, but got no answer. The old man just passed on and
disappeared. The Indian was thoroughly frightened and knew it was a
ghost.
Another Indian was once working alone at quite some distance away
from town for a white man. He was supposed to be quite alone, yet
about noon he looked into the log cabin and to his surprise saw an old
white man with white hair sitting on a chair and leaning his head
pensively on one hand, staring blankly. The Indian ducked, then looked
in again, and there sat the old man, quite immovable. He was convinced
he saw a ghost. In dismay he ran off many miles away to town and
told his white employer he would not work there because of the ghost.
The white man poked fun at him and said he would go back with him
and see it. They returned, looked in, but the old man had disappeared.
It was a ghost.
It is not a good thing to camp at a place where others who are not
definitely known to be living have camped. It is believed that the ghosts
of dead people who had camped there would be likely to linger about
the spot and bother the new campers.","[831, 832]"

to be near the shore,"" said that one then. And then he came out
on to land. ""Now, then, get out!"" "" N o ! "" said then the (Porcupine),
""further off yonder."" So he got some distance further. "" G o ahead,
now!"" said (the buffalo). And then that one hit his heart with his
tail, whereupon he scurried off, startled. Then he fell down over
there. And then the buffaloes came up to him at that place and
gored him there with their horns, and they ripped him open all over.
He, then, came out, the Porcupine. He had been sitting inside of
his hip bone, so they did not kill him.
And so he came out, and there he was standing and singing. "" With
what, pray, shall I be butchering?"" said he as he sang. The water was
flowing a little distance along from there, and Coyote was walking
about there. He heard then, "" W i t h what, pray, shall I be butchering?"" as (Porcupine) spoke; Coyote heard it. And then he went
right up to there. There was Porcupine walking about. And then
he asked him, "" W h a t did you say?"" said he. And then (Porcupine
said), "" I did not say anything. 'With what, pray, shall I be scraping
off willow-bark?' that, indeed, is what I said."" And then, "" N o ! ""
said (Coyote). "" 'With what, pray, shall I be butchering?' that,
indeed, is what you said. Indeed I heard it plainly."" There they were
saying the same thing over and over again, they kept answering each
other. ""You did not indeed say so."" And then Porcupine said,
""Yes."" But then that Porcupine said, "" I did kill a buffalo right
there."" ""Yes, my friend!"" (said Coyote).
Then they went up to the (buffalo). And then (Coyote) said,
"" T h e one that jumps over him shall butcher him."" So he ran and
jumped over him, to the other side of him. Then Porcupine ran but
jumped only as far as here, right on his rib he jumped. So then
Coyote butchered the (buffalo). Deinde Canis secundum Humen
defaecavit, and then he butchered the (buffalo) again. And then,
so doing, he took out all of his paunch. And then he (said to Porcupine), "" G o and wash out all of his paunch. Do not eat anything of
it."" So he carried it off to the water and washed it there. Out of
it, then, a bit of fat broke off. Then he took it and began to eat it,
when somebody a slight distance away was heard talking. 5 "" H e

And then (Porcupine) was scared, while that (Coyote) went right up
to him. "" T h a t is not what I said. You are not to eat any of that.""

There are absolute verb forms in -ψοα'αρα-, a suffix apparently
combining -ijwa'a(i)- and -apa- (see a). It is not evident how they
differ, if at all, from ordinary negative absolutes in - ap a-. Examples
are:

used as negative verb; cf. qatcu'rarjWA paa'iyarjwa' aicv we (inclus.)

Forms in -qwa'ap a-vi- seem to be agentives of negative absolutes
in -ywa'apa- (but cf. negatived agentives in -vi'ap a-, 1 above), e. g.:
rii' qatc ampa'xAhtirjwa'ap αφι I not talk-cause-negative-agentive, I
(am) one who causes not to talk, I do not allow to talk
(c) Negative forms of verbalizing -kai-. The verbalizing suffixes
-kai- το B E and -kai- το HAVE (see § 26, 1, a and b) become -ai- in the
negative. This - ai- takes the place of any specifically negative suffix.

""Indeed, she did not take them,"" (said his messenger). "" Go again and
take some."" So he again took some of them and went off again.
Going up to her he threw them down again, but once more she just
sat and looked at them. So again he picked them up and went back
again. ""Yes,"" (said Coyote), ""she is still feeling lonesome."" When
the two of them, (she and her boy), had arrived (at Chicken Hawk's
house, she said), ""We, indeed, are on our way to that one, as the one
that was father of this one said."" And then the old woman said,
"" Yes, it is not here that he is accustomed to sleep, it is over there at
the entrance into a big rock that he is accustomed to lie.""
And then the young woman started off in yonder direction over
there to the big rock. She made round holes in the rock to serve as
steps. She pecked at the place where he was accustomed to lie.
Proceeding there, she arrived at that place. In there the rabbit
blanket was lying on his bedding. And then she went down back again,
and when she got there, she felt proud. Now the hunters of jackrabbits came back, each to his own home. A boy came along shooting
the jack-rabbits after the two of them had arrived there. The boy
came last of all, shooting along. He was accustomed to kill just one,
and right there at his mother he threw it. She picked it up. And
when he had gone home, he commenced to suck (his mother's breast).
He looked cross at that (other) boy. The young woman was sitting
and looking at him. (The old woman) took out the intestines from
the jack-rabbit and roasted it in the ashes. I t was roasted, it was
roasted after a little while. And then she took it out of the ashes,
she took out the (jack-rabbits) which had become numerous in there.
And then she looked at them and they were steaming very much there.
Now Chicken Hawk cried out and grabbed one of them in his talons,
and he flew off to his house, holding in his talons the jack-rabbit that
he had taken. There Chicken Hawk arrived at his house. He
entered and went asleep. And then the young woman, when it had
become a little dark, went to that place. Having gone off yonder,
she arrived there and caught hold of him. Then Chicken Hawk
cried out:
ki· ki· ki· ki· ki·' k.'
Coyote and his people were gathered together during the night and
smoking, Coyote being their chief. And then he heard (Chicken
Hawk's cries). "" Something has happened to my friend who has been
caught hold of,"" said he. He seized his quiver and took his arrows.","[525, 526, 527]"

"Shamans
Anyone, a man or woman, 113 may be a medicine-man ('medicinewoman', manma E umpuwaxant""). The power of doctoring is not acquired
by a period of fasting or training in the mountains, but may be acquired
in the ordinary course of life (after puberty and before 30 — 40 years of
age) by dreaming. Every medicine-man has his guardian spirit who helps
him and who is appealed to by one or more songs. Every spirit has his
special songs; these seem to have no intelligible words. Knowledge of
the songs was gained by dreaming of them. One of the most powerfulKaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes831of the medicine spirits was the eagle. As soon as the medicine-man
begins his song, the guardian spirit, no matter how far away at the time,
approaches, and from a distance communicates with the medicine-man,
telling him of the whereabouts of the sickness. All this is quite invisible
to the ordinary people about. It is told that in a tepee during the night,
when a medicine-man was doctoring, a sound as of the whirring of an
eagle's wings was heard descending clear down to where the poles meet
on top on the outside. Someone went out to see, but could see no eagle.
It was the medicine-man's eagle guardian that had come to answer the
medicine-man's call. In doctoring the medicine-man would sometimes
sit by the patient (generally at night) and sing his medicine-song; at
times he would get up and sing (no regular dance). Sometimes he sang
alone, sometimes others present sang with him, following his song. In
a very severe case, several medicine-men might be used, each singing
his own song. A medicine-man might give some of his power away to
others, as by giving them his songs. If he ""divides"" his power too much,
he loses in efficacy; thus it happens that some medicine-men, in growing
older, are less able to cure disease. Part of the doctoring consisted of
sucking the point where the pain was most acute. 114
The disease could be extracted in some visible form. Once Tony saw
a medicine-man show everyone present at the doctoring a colorless
round object like a glass marble as the pain he had extracted. Tony
made fun of him and said that he had merely taken a glass marble to
show the people. Some time after, the medicine-man came over to him
as he was lying in camp and stroked him, saying some more or less
unintelligible words. His folks were there at the time and were greatly
frightened, thinking the medicine-man was taking his revenge and that
Tony would die. But Tony did not die, and within a year the medicineman himself died. He was not considered much of a medicine-man.
After this Tony was pointed out by his uncle as a wonderful boy.
One time Tony, when a young boy, felt so sleepy that he slept during
the last night of the ""cry,"" which was strictly forbidden. Everyone was
talking about it the next morning, when they found out. Some time
after, Tony fell sick. A noted medicine-man then in Arizona (Trumbull
Mountain) was called; he was sleeping then, but got up immediately
and went. The first two nights his doctoring was not very successful;
only the third night did he say that his spirit was coming and that he
was beginning to see. Tony then recovered. He was given a horse in
payment.","[834, 835]"

to present time or, particularly in secondary substantival uses, is
tenseless. Participles of explicitly temporal reference may be
formed from the present participle by prefixing appropriate temporal
suffixes to -ti-n. Animate plurals are formed by suffixing -m i- (§
48, 1, a), e. g. -rim 'i-.

Animate plurals of active
participles have been already referred to. They end in -fi-m 'i-. A
curious idiom allows of their use also as singulars. This takes place
when the participle refers to a person (or animal) that is singled out
from a number or is compared with others. The plural ending of the
participle, in other words, refers to the implied collectivity rather
than to the person explicitly indicated. Examples are:

two lying,"" said he. They ran off towards the house, and that father
of theirs asked them. "" W a y over there there seems to be something lying,"" said they. "" W h a t did I say?"" said Badger. And
then he started to travel under the surface of the earth. Then he came
up to them and doctored them there. He first caused the boy to get
well, and then after him he made his mother well. And then Badger
said, "" Pay me with feathers."" "" We two did not pluck out any of the
feathers,"" said the woman. That one kept on saying, "" P a y me with
feathers."" "" W h a t do you mean when you say feathers?"" said she,
as she pulled out some of her pubic hair. ""Yes, yes, yesl"" said he.
""These are the feathers that I speak of."" Then he did so while
moving. 75 And then he said, "" G o ahead I let him, my dear, travel
in yonder direction away up from here. Even though there is a noise
going on, you shall not let him look at it. Even though people are
singing in the canyon, even though people are laughing, you two shall
not peep at it,"" said Badger. And then he went back from there.
Then they started off in that direction. Sure enough, there was a
noise going on in the canyon. "" O my mother! let us take a peep
at it, only a little bit,"" said the boy. "" N o ! That, indeed, is what
your great-grandfather said,"" said his mother. Although they said
that, they did peep at the canyon. ""Oh! over there someone has
taken a peep,"" said (those evil spirits). ""Blood! blood!"" As soon
as they said this, blood flowed out of the mouths of mother and son.
The Badger said just as before, "" I have not been dreaming well,""
and those sons of his did the same. The very tiniest one of all said
the same thing, and over yonder they two are lying. Badger again
went off and came to where they were. And again he doctored them.
He said the same thing, "" P a y me with feathers."" The young woman
understood what he meant, and again he did thus while moving.
When he had done so, he said, ""Coyote will be hunting, but you
shall not pay any attention to him as you go along. On the other
side of (Coyote's) camp an old woman will be dwelling, and that is
where you are to arrive,"" said Badger. They started off on their way
through there. Sure enough, Coyote was helping at that place to
burn brush (in order to scare up rabbits). "" O h ! "" said Coyote.
""Where my house is will be easily recognized by the noise, by the
sound of women laughing as though they were happy,"" said Coyote.
So the two of them started off again in that direction, but they passed
by Coyote's house. They arrived at the house of the old woman,
(who was Hawk's mother).","[476, 477]"

woman,"" said he then, "" b u t this here where you have been sitting
smells old."" Skunk asked her. And then, when he had asked her,
(she said), "" W h a t is it that you were asking? They say that your
elder brother has died, the Owl, that indeed is what his widow was
saying, and then the two of them were on their way."" ""Yes, why is
it that you did not let me know? Why is it that she has taken away
from me my brother's son?""
And then the Skunk started off in yonder direction and followed
them in their tracks. Now the two of them were going yonder. And
then the young woman looked back. He was coming very close to
them. And then he caught up with them. When he had caught up
with them, he embraced her, he kept hugging her. And then she
took her lice and threw them away on a rock. "" Stop this that you
have been doing! Over there are mountain sheep,"" (said she). And
right there were mountain sheep, and they were not far away. So
he put his skunk robe about the young woman, and then, when he
had done so and after he had gone, she put that blanket of his around
a wild-rose bush, and having so done, the two of them went off again.
""Stay right here,"" said he, and so saying he started off in yonder
direction. He crouched up to the (mountain sheep). He shot at
them, he killed them all, and when he had finished killing them off,
he came back to the same place. And she was still (apparently) sitting
when he went and looked. And then, when somewhat further on his
way back, he closed his eyes. Again he proceeded to hug the (bush),
there he hugged it for quite a while. And then he opened his eyes to
see a rose bush that had a robe thrown about it. ""Oh, oh! what is
the matter! Don't, you fighter with your finger nails!"" While he
kept hugging it, he tore to pieces the blanket that was thrown thereon.
The young woman was not there, nor her boy. And then he went
to his mountain sheep that he had killed, his arrows were lying scattered
about in every direction. He went over there and picked them up.
Lice were stuck on to his arrows, to the arrow-points. And then
Skunk was angry. ""Where then would they be remaining?"" said
Skunk then. When he had said this, pepedit. Then, as they were
looking, podex Viverrae kept coming on as in a cloud of darkness.
""Move along fast, my dear boy,"" said she then, as it was coming near.
And then podex Viverrae caught up with them. And then it killed
both of them.

"There are two groups of suffixed elements that indicate voice, i. e.
direction of action with reference to subject, object, or indirect object.
The first group (1-9) is a primary series that is not freely used; that is
closely welded with the verb stem (often with internal stem changes);
that occurs in contrasting pairs of mediopassive (or intransitive)
and active (or transitive); and that, for the most part, involve at the
same time other ideas than that of voice, namely verbal aspect (see
3 below) and number. This group will be only listed here for convenience of reference and taken up later under other headings. The
second group (10-14) is used with great freedom and indicates voice
relations of a somewhat more external sort. Suffixes of the latter
sort are often appended to the former.
(1) -q-i- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of momentaneous aspect
and singular number (see § 30, 3).
(2) -71-, (-ijqi-) mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of iterative-durative aspect (see § 30, 2).
(3) -ya- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of durative aspect (see
§ 30, 1).
(4) -tcai- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of primarily durative
aspect and of plural number (see § 31, 2, a).
(5) -na- transitive suffix of durative aspect and singular number
of object (see § 31, 2, b).
(6) -n'na- transitive suffix of momentaneous aspect and singular
number of object (see § 31, 2, c).
(7) -tea- transitive suffix of plural number of object (see § 31, 2, d).
(8) -a - final stem vowel indicating active voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -i- (9).
(9) -i- final stem vowel indicating inactive voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -a - (8).
(10) -rjqi-"" transitivizing or activating suffix appended to verbs
of primarily mediopassive aspect. It is particularly common with
preceding -q i-, -yi- (1 and 2 above) and generally occurs with an
instrumental prefix in the verb (§ 21). Before it mediopassive -i- (see
9 above) sometimes becomes active -a - (8); an -a- of the active stemX Southern Paiute and Ute

form of an older variable -r'ui-, -t ui-, -ntui-, which has become
generalized for all cases. There seems also to have been an alternation between momentaneous -t'ui- andd urative -r'ui- (see § 53, 2, b).
An example of causative -ntui- is 'a'cmtui- τ ο LIKE. Causative
-r'ui- (durative) is exemplified in iyä'r'ui- το CAUSE TO BE AFRAID, TO
FRIGHTEN; with this contrast momentaneous iya'tuiτο FRIGHTEN
(at one moment of time).
(12a) -n-i- causative. This element occurs so uncommonly t h a t
it has not been found possible to determine its precise application.
Examples are:

naywi'qa'minip'iya'
self-cover-causative-past, covered (him)self

Ν A' SO'XO' ma'mp'iya'
covered (him)self with moist ground, dirt (cf.
also NA^sa'xu'map 'iya' covered self with dirt)
In the last two examples, which are provided with reflexive prefixes, it is to be noted t h a t the reflexive is better considered the logical
object of the causative suffix than of the verb; e. g. HE CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE COVERED, not HF. CAUSED TO COVER HIMSELF.

HE COVERED TO HIMSELF.(13) -ti -s passive; sometimes heard as -H-, but always twomoraed. This suffix is freely used to make true passives out of
transitive verbs. Examples are:

The last two examples illustrate passive participles in -t'i-ri-n (cf.
§ 25, 6, a). These differ from passive participles in -pi- and -p'i(§ 25, 5) in referring to passing or non-characteristic states. Contrasting with SA'pi'x-AtiRi, for instance, is SA'pi'xam ip i ONE WHO
IS ALWAYS OVERCOME (-m i- is usitative, § 30, 10).
Passives may be readily formed from causatives, e. g. ivi'( uii}uti tca r)A D R I N K - C A U S E - M O M E N T A N E O U S - P A S S I V E - P R E T E R I T -H E , HEWASHere the causative suffix precedes the passive,
as is to be expected. Curiously enough, the same order is followed
in causatives of passives, an indirective -rjqi- coming in between the
causative suffix and the passive - t i - , e. g.:
CAUSED TO DRINK.uiyki'fi v""'a yarayWA
catch-cause-to-passive-shall-he-us, he will
get us caught (lit., he will cause to us to be caught)
pA'qa'niuiyqiti tca rjA kill-cause-to-passive-preterit-him, (he) caused
him to be killed (for -nlui- cf. 12 above)
maa'i(In other words, the passive suffix can not precede the causative.
In the preceding examples the indirective is required to point to the
logical object as the indirect object, the passive of the verb itself
being apparently conceived of as the direct object, e. g. H E WILLCAUSE-BEING-CAUGHT TO-US.
That these forms are causatives of
passives, not, as would be inferred from their appearance, passives of
causatives, is proved by the absence of a plural subjective -q a- (see
§ 31, 1, c) in the first form above; this would be required if the fomr
were to be understood as WE SHALL B E CAUSED TO B E CAUGHT BY HIM.
(14) -tu'a-' (-t' ua- ) impersonal. Verbs with impersonal subject
or, less often, object refer either to an indefinitely defined person or
to a collectivity, people in general. In the latter case, if used sub
jectively, it may be preceded by the pluralizing -qa- (§ 31, 1, c). The
impersonal suffix is often employed as the equivalent of the passive,
never simultaneously with it. It follows perfective -qai- and narrative preterit -ρϊ(α)·γαί-, but precedes present -yi- and future
-va (nia)(see § 34). Curiously enough, present -yi- regularlyX Southern Paiute and Ute
148SAPIRfollows -tu'a- even in preterit tense forms (cf. also -p• la-yai-tua-y'i-; §
32, 8). As already noted (§ 19, 2, e), it is frequently accompanied
by enclitic -w oa-. Examples of subjective -t-u'a- are:
pAKqa'rju(ua{i)ylayA kill-momentaneous-impersonal-present-him, they
(indef.) kill him, he is being killed
pApa' cp Aqwa' iyupi'iyai' (iia(i)yiaml kill (distributive)- go-momentaneous-past-impersonal-present-them, people went to kill them

As impersonal object -t u'a-' seems to be used only indirectly after
-rjqi-, e. g.:
qa'ijqitu'a(i)yini
sing-to-impersonal-present-I, I sing with them

play-hand-game-to-impersonal-plural-past,

These examples show that -yqi-i ua- generally denotes cooperation
with a group. Moreover, the two suffixes form a close unit, as they
occur before elements that would normally precede -t-u'a- alone (e. g.
-yw'ai- ΤΟ GO TO, narrative preterit -p 'iyai-, plural subject -q-a-);
see above examples.
§ 30. Suffixes of verbal aspect.
By ""aspect,"" a term borrowed from Slavic grammar, is here meant
the temporal range of the action, i. e. its definition with respect to
such concepts as momentaneousness, durativeness, inception, iteration. These and like concepts have no primary connection with
the concept of relative time, which is the province of the temporal
suffixes (§ 32).","[161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166]"

"Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE67(3) NASALIZATION. Nasalized consonants occur intervocalically
as a result of the nasalizing power of a stem or element; as the result
of reduplicating stems with interior nasal (e. g. qaijqa'ni- HOUSES
< qan i- HOUSE; see § 58, 2, d); and internally in stems and elements
from obscure causes (in part these internal nasalizations may be
due to the assimilatory influence of a preceding nasal: e. g. nayqavaEAR from Shoshonean *naka-, cf. Hopi nakuve, though elision of -ain parallel Shoshonean *nanaka-, cf. Gabrielino -nanax, may be a
preferable explanation; yet internal nasalization sometimes appears
where comparative evidence gives no apparent reason for it, e. g.
tuyu'mpa- sky, cf. Möhineyam duguba-t, Gabrielino takupa-r, yet also
Tübatulabal dogumha-l).
Nasalized consonants that result from the nasalizing power of a
preceding element may be grouped into three classes: 1. -ntc- (-nts-)
that results from a -tc- (-ts-), original or itself developed from -t(see § 13, 3), that is either inherently ""spirantal"" or rather ungeminated (e. g. -tea- preterital) or ""spirantized"" by a preceding stem
or element, provided there is a nasal consonant in the syllable preceding the -tc- (-ts-) (this type is not properly ""nasalized"" at all,
but is merely a secondarily nasalized development of the spirantized
group; see 1 above); 2. nasalized stops (andaffricatives) that alternate
with spirantized, but not geminated, consonants and that seem to
occur primarily, but not altogether, when the preceding .syllable
contains a -y- or -yw- (e. g. agentive -vi-, -mpi, alternating in no -viCARRIER, taya-mpi- K I C K E R ) ; 3. nasalized stops (and affricatives)
that alternate with spirantized and geminated consonants. The
primary cause for the nasalization in the last group is generally
obscure. The presence of an interior nasal in the stem may be the
cause in some cases (e. g. taywa-"" TOOTH). Elision of a syllable
containing a nasal is demonstrable in a small number of cases (e. g.
pa'a-n το BE HIGH, participle pa'anti-·, cf. parallel pa'an i-). In cases
like usitative -mia-, -mi-""·, -kai- το HAVE, participle -kanfi-; perfective
-qai-, participle -q anfi- one suspects Shoshonean *-rnina-, *-kani-,
*-q ani- with ungeminated -η-, which would disappear between
vowels but assert itself as nasalization of the following consonant
when the final vowel of the element is elided. Examples of nasalizing
power are:

certain amount of sporadic variation between spirantized and nasalized consonants, in part depending on nasal assimilation, but not
altogether. Examples are:

tive form)(alterna-In the last three examples an original nasalized consonant has
become geminated, partly for assimilative, partly for dissimilative
reasons. In the first example the geminated consonant probably
represents the original form.
Finally, there is some vacillation also between spirantized and
geminated consonants. A number of elements that are primarily
spirantizing are geminating in certain isolated forms, e. g.:
τηα-' hand, ma-"":MA'pa'iyavu<j>i palm; MA'tca'i'ayqi-mu-' nose (e. g. mu-rona- to strike
with one's nose), mu-""·.t o reach f o r ;MA'pi'ki-to touch with the hand
Mu'pwi'k i<j>i mucusQuite distinct from this group, which evidently constitutes an
archaic stratum (thus, there is no verb -pih i- without prefix), are examples of stems which are inherently spirantizing but are treated as
geminating when compounded with stems that occur independently.
It is particularly verb (including adjective) stems, followed by noun
or verb stems, that are so treated. Thus, arjqa-' RED (cf. aijqa-ya- το

"" I am his dung for some time."" 3 Thereupon he went on, Porcupine
went on again. And there another's dung was lying. Then he asked
it again, and again went off yonder. When over there, he asked
again. "" J u s t now, indeed, have they moved on through here,""

he went on again; there, now, they were quite fresh. Right there

more freely used than the -kai- verbs from which they are derived
Compounded with indirective -iiqi- (§ 29, 2) this element seems to
appear as -ai- (cf. negative -ai- NOT TO BE, § 57, 2, c). -ai-rjqiseems

*4 This incident argues a knowledge on the part of the Paiute Indians of
the custom of burning the dead. The custom, however, was not practiced
by the Paiutes themselves. This point may eventually help to determine
from what tribe or area the widespread story of the ""hoodwinked dancers""
came to the Paiute.

Then, after a while, when his companions had been used up too,
Coyote said to that Road-runner, ""Go ahead! you take and carry
along this fire."" And then Road-runner took and carried it along;
he tore apart his feet (so that they left tracks) in different directions;
those who were in pursuit of them lost track of Road-runner. Then
they tracked him back and forth in different directions.25 ""(He is)
under this,"" said they, as they ran hither and thither in different
directions. Those companions of Coyote built a fire up on the
mountain. ""Would that they would look up this way!"" said Coyote's
companions. And then one of those looked towards the mountain.
""Oh, what is that there on the mountain? Oh, it is something burning,"" said they. ""Let us cause rain to fall on it,"" said they. Sure
enough, then, black clouds gathered right over that place. ""Oh,""
said Coyote's companions, ""it is going to rain upon us."" And that
Coyote then said, ""Let us keep some of the fire hidden."" As soon
as Coyote had spoken, he covered some of the fire. All of that fire
(which was uncovered) went out; all of them, his companions, got
wet. And then that fire (which was covered) nearly went out.
And then Coyote said, ""You Jack-rabbit, who always sit out in
the open, go ahead! hide this fire."" That Jack-rabbit sat on his
haunches over that (fire) out there in the rain. ""Did I say (it should
be done) in that way?"" said Coyote; having taken up his bow and
arrows, he acted as though about to shoot him. Then that rain
stopped; and then the Jack-rabbit hopped off away from the (fire).
Now that (fire) was very red.
Then Coyote asked all bushes and said, ""Are you accustomed to
burn even when wet?"" "" I never burn when wet,"" said all those
bushes. Then only that sagebrush was left. To it Coyote said,
""Are you accustomed to burn when wet?"" ""Yes, I am accustomed
to burn even when wet."" said the sagebrush. And then Coyote
built a fire out of the sagebrush. ""There shall be fire in all of you
bushes,"" said Coyote. So then all bushes got to contain fire.
Did any of you hear something make a noise on the other side?","[414, 415]"
"(2) V E R B A L USE OF POSTPOSITIONS. All postpositions indicating
movement, also some indicating presence, may be and frequently are
verbified without further change in form. Formal verbal suffixes (e. g.
momentaneous -yu- and tense elements) are directly suffixed to the
postposition. Examples of such verbified uses are:
au'mituywa'a
it-back-from-thou! go out (of it)!

All postpositions may be participialized by means of -ft-"" (§ 25, 6,
a); e. g. -va nti-, obj. -va-nfia-, BEING AT ( - v a • - "" AT). Such participialized postpositions are often employed where simple local phrases or
adverbs would appear in English, e. g. H E GATHERED STICKS THATw
w
AT-BEING-OBJ. (uv a'ntiA) instead of simply THAT-AT, THERE (vv a"").
Sometimes the participial form takes on a specialized significance;
e. g. U'VIA IT-ON, THEREON, THEREAT, but umu'a!nt'i (obj. umwa'ntiA)
BEING THEREAT, i. e. SOME OF IT. Participialized postpositions may
be followed by other postpositions, e. g. -va nfi-m a-nayqwa- ATBEING-ON-FROM, AWAY FROM.",[236]
"T W O encliticelementsare used to refer to past time.
(a) -tea-, -ntca-. This element refers to the recent past and is
often best translated by the English perfect. For the forms -tea',
•ntca' see § 7. Examples are:
tona't-ϊ team I have been hit
tavL tsdea rjani pAxqa'yuni having-hit-past-he-me kill-me; having hit

If a pronominal enclitic is used possessively with the preceding
noun, the enclitic -(n)tca- follows (aside from -φϊ ONE'S OWN), e. g. :

off
but:

With interrogative ai- (§ 44, 2, c) -tea- apparently refers to present
time, e. g. a'iicarjWA WHERE IS HE? but there is probably an implied
reference to the past, e. g. WHERE HAS HE (GONE TO) ? It is sometimes
used with exhortative ivw'i- (§ 60,2,d), e. g. Wi'tcan ixa'"" LET-PAST-METHEN, LET ME THEN!(b) -ywa-, a general preterital element referring to more remote
time than -(n)tca-. For the form -ywa' see § 7. Examples are:
pA'qa'rpiywarjani I killed him (narrative form; contrast pA'qa'rjuntca rjani I have killed him [just now])

aija'x uru""a who-past he? who was he? (-a: < -xw; § 13, 7, c)
rii'ywa' to'nA I-past punch, I punched (long ago)
That -ywa- is no true tense suffix is shown by the fact that it may
be used with the verbal -y'i- suffix of present time (see § 32, 1), e. g.:
imi'xwar'uaqA
man'yqaiyiaq-A thou-past-interrogative-it createpresent-it? didst thou create it?
ivi'yixwa j-ayA drink-present-past-it-he, he drank it (long ago)
A broken form -ywa'a- (perhaps -ywa- + -a-, 3) also occurs.
Its morphology is not clear. Examples are:

Volumes I-VI of The Collected Works of Edward Sapir consist, for
the most part, of shorter papers; by contrast, Volumes VII-XV are
devoted to longer works of monographic nature — grammars, dictionaries, text collections, and extended ethnographic accounts. Many of
these were published by Sapir during his lifetime; others were edited by
his students and published after his death; still others are now being
edited and published for the first time. The organization of each individual volume in this latter group brings together, in most instances,
works on a single language and culture; in a few volumes, however, the
unifying element is one of linguistic family or of culture area.
Preparation of these monographic volumes has been aided by grants
from the National Science Foundation (grant no. BNS-8609411), the
Phillips Fund of the American Philosophical Society, and the WennerGren Foundation for Anthropological Research.
Sapir received his doctorate at Columbia University in 1908, and
took up a position at the University of Pennsylvania. His first field
work thereafter, in 1909, was in Utah, with the Uncompahgre and
Uintah Utes. Back in Philadelphia in 1910, be obtained a much
greater amount of data on a closely related dialect, the Kaibab variety
of Southern Paiute, as spoken by Tony Tillohash, then a student at
Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. The major publication which
resulted from this work, Sapir's Southern Paiute Language — grammar, texts, and dictionary — was written in 1917, but not published
until 1930 — 31; it is reprinted in the present volume. Permission for
this reprinting has kindly been granted by the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences. In addition, we publish here for the first time an
English index to Sapir's Southern Paiute dictionary, prepared by Wick
Miller, as well as ethnographic notes gathered by Sapir from his Ute
and Paiute consultants, here edited and annotated by Catherine S.
Fowler and Robert C. Euler. A topic index for the present volume
has been prepared by Jane McGary.
The Editorial Board is grateful to Robert C. Euler, Catherine S.
Fowler, Jane McGary, and Wick Miller for their participation in the
preparation of this volume.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"Before subordinating -qu- (§55, 1, e), -q ai- appears as -q a - (cf. §26,
1, a and b; § 30, 9); e. g. yaa'iyqw' aikaqoajjA AFTER HE HAD GONE OUT
HUNTING. For perfective participial -qanti-, see § 25, 6, d. Though
perfectly analogous in treatment to resultative -q ai- (§ 30, 9) and
perhaps etymologically related to it, it is in practice felt as a distinct
element, as shown by the occurrence of -q aijc ai- resultative-perfective, e. g.:
tayo'isidiuito cause to cover
over on toptjyj'tsidiuk-aik
a had (evidently) been caused to cover over
on topThe perfective idea frequently takes on an inferential implication.
An explicit inferential present-perfect (HAS EVIDENTLY -ED) is formed
by combining perfective -q ai- with present -yi-: -q aiy'i-. In general
it seems that perfective -q ai- regularly implies lack of direct knowledge on the part of the speaker, differing in this respect from enclitic
-(n)tca- (§ 19, 1, a). Examples of inferential -q-ai{yi)- are:

this element generally adds an intentive or hortatory force to its

(§ 25, 6, b), it seems to indicate mere futurity. I t is used also in simple
future statements that are conditional on other acts. Examples of

206SAPIRu- are formed the verbs of being: aro'a- το be (vis.) and uru'a- το

(5) ai-, mai-. These are extended forms of demonstrative a- and
ma-. They are used as independent inanimate demonstrative pronouns, particularly with verbs of saying, (talking, hearing). However,
they are not ordinarily found except followed by pronominal enclitics.
Their objective forms are aia·, maia- (probably < a-ya-, ma-ya-).
As to usage, ai- is best translated as t h a t (indefinite), mai- as t h a t
(quoted, referred to).
Examples of subjective ai- are:
a'inl nayqa'q aip ini that-my heard (partic.)-my, that (is) what I
heard
a'i(y)aq-A qu'qo'qwikanayum aRi that-it (vis.) shoot (distributively)plural-verbal noun-your (plur.) it (vis.), that (is) it which you
(plur.) shoot at
Examples of objective aia- are:
a'ian 'a'imi
that (obj.)-I say- usitative, that's what I always say
a'ia y (fir 'a'imi' that (obj.)-he (vis.) indeed say-usitative, that's
what he indeed always says
'a'i 'iy'ir 'aik^A that (obj.)-thou indeed said, that indeed you said
(for 'ai < 'aia', see § 40, 2)
Curiously enough, objective aia- becomes ai- before the interrogative, the two elements combining as aitcu'a-, aintcu'a-, e. g.:
a'itcnan (or a'infcuan) a'ik ?A that (obj.)-interrogative-I said, did
I say that?
a'intcua r) 'a'imi' that (obj.)-interrogative-he (vis.) say-usitative, is
he wont to say that? does he really mean that?
Subjective mai- is illustrated in:
ma'in n\ni nar/qa'qaip'ini that (quoted)-my me heard (partic.)-my,
that's what I heard
mai'm imi nayqa'q ainA that-thy thee hearing, that's what you hear
Examples of objective maia- are:
ma'ian 'aik *A that I say
ma'i(y) 'iy'ir 'a'ik -Λ that indeed thou sayest (mai < maia' as above)
Parallel to maia- is m""a'ia-, e. g.:Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean Language

u w
m a'iAcampan niruyw ampa'xA that -(obj.)-only-me I-to talk, that
only talk to me! stop talking to me!
As we have already seen, aia- is also used as inanimate visible
objective article-pronoun: 'α'ΪΑ (§ 42, 7). Its parallel invisible 'oa'iA
(probably < u-a-ya-) is not used as independent demonstrative,
though it must be such in origin. For adverbial-connective use of
ai-, see § 60, 2, a; for 'οα'ΪΑ as modal adverb, see § 60, 3.
(6) VERBS OF SAYING. Parallel to the demonstratives ai- and radiäre the verbs of saying: ai- το SAY (indefinitely) and mai- (mwa'ia-)
u w
TO SAY THAT (which has been quoted); e. g. qatc m a' iar/wai' yucampA
NOT SAY-THAT-NEGATIVE-SUBORDINATING-ONLY,ALTHOUGH NOT SAY-ING THAT. Either these verbs result from composition with demonstrative α-, ma- (m w a'-); or they are merely verbified forms of demonstrative ai- and mat-.
Note on § § 39-43.
The three classes of pronouns already discussed observe the distinction in the third person between visible (or present) and invisible
(or absent) forms. Nevertheless sentences occur, as may have been
noticed, in which the same person or object is designated now as
visible, now as invisible. To a large extent this seems to be due to a
desire to prevent the same phonetic group (""word"") from containing
both a visible and an invisible element (see, for combinations of
two enclitics, § 41, 1, e), but not entirely. Apparently the difference
between the two sets of forms tends to become a formal rather than
a strictly functional matter. Examples of such contradictory
sentences are:
imi'ntcu'a-ijA pini'Rai'iijWA
tiyi'vw'ia'm u'IJWA thou-interrogativehim (vis.) see-him (inv.) friend-obj.-thy he (inv.; = him), did you

§ 44. Interrogative pronouns.
Interrogative stems may he divided into two groups, those employed
denominatively (interrogative pronouns proper) and those employedX Southern Paiute and Ute
208SAPiRadverbially or serving as base for adverbial forms. They are not
accompanied by the interrogative enclitic -ru'a- (§ 19, 2, f).
( 1 ) D E N O M I N A T I V E FORMS.
Four or five denominative stems are
found: aya-, ini-, impi-, and αηια-; further ay a-, which is always
verbalized or adverbialized by suffixed elements.
(a) arja- WHO? This interrogative refers to persons only. Its
objective form is ayaia-; its subjective plural is ayami- (see § 48, 1),
objective ayam'ia-. I t must not be confused with αηα- H E , THAT
ONE (§ 39). I t is perhaps to avoid this confusion that interrogative
aya- is apparently never used with postpositions; e. g. aya'ruxwA
denotes το HIM, not το WHOM?. The latter idea would have to be
expressed periphrastically (see § 50, 8). Examples of αηα- are:ay aru""a who is? who is it?
ay aro""avi iyA who would-be this-one? I wonder who this is!
'ay an i'lc -A who does-so? who is it that does so?
at) aije- αηιρα'χαχα who says talking? who is that talking? (referring
to one who is heard but not seen)
aya'i aro"""" whom ( = whose) is? whose is it? (contrast aya'iacaro""a it is his)
ayai uywa'rux wA whom he (inv.)-to? to whom?
ayam,· aro""a who (plur.) are? who are they?
aya'm'iantca' pAxqa'yu whom (plur.)- preterit-thou kill? whom (2)
did you kill?
(b) in i-' WHO? WHAT? OF WHAT SORT? This is a generalized
animate interrogative pronoun, referring to an animal, an animate
being not known to be definitely human or animal, or a person of
undefined characteristics. Subjective in-i- sometimes appears as
unelided ini before aro'a- το BE. Its objective singular is inia-·,
subjective plural in iyw'i- (see § 48, 1), objective iniyw'ia-.
Examples
are:
in- aro' i'y.i what is this (anim.)?
in i aro""a what is it (anim.)?
ini'ntcan niywu'runl
who-preterit-me person-make-me? who ever
made me a peron? who ever respected me?
iniyw aro""a what (plur.) are? what are they (animals)?
ini'ywi aro"""" what (plur. obj.) are? to what (animals) does it belong?
(c) impi-' WHAT (inanimate); objective imp'ia-. In all probability
impi- is connected with in i-·, for -pi- see nominalizing suffix -ρ-'i-, § 25,Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE2095, b? imp'i- may be used with at least certain postpositions (e. g. -m aWITH) ; it may also be used as a nominal base for verbal derivatives,
e. g. impi'yai- τ ο HAVE WHAT? impuru- τ ο MAKE WHAT? Examples
of imp'i- are:
imp ατο""α what is it (vis.)?
imp uru""a what is it (inv.)?
imp'i'a rjA fi'qa'va' what (obj.)-he (vis.) eat-shall? what will he eat
imp'i'ma' fiya'nivani
what-with-thou butcher-will? what will you
butcher with?
imp'i'xai' what hast thou?
impu'ruyiarjA
what is he making?
(d) ania- WHAT? This interrogative is used only as the object
of verbs of saying or mental activity, e. g.:
'ani'an 'aik -Λ what-I say? what did I say?
im αη ιΑ nan o'c ivätcf thou what being-wont-to-dream? what have
you ever dreamt?
ani'a' cy.via 'i' what-thou think-present? what are you thinking of?
Aside from its use as an interrogative pronoun, an ia- frequently
appears as a verb, ΤΟ SAY WHAT? AS such it is treated analogously to
ai- TO SAY. Examples are:
im 'ani'avatci thou wont-to-say-what? what are you accustomed to
say?
an i Axqa r)A what did he (vis.) say? (for -qa- see § 32, 2)
'ani'axai' a'ik-?A say-what-subordinating-thou say-so? for what
reason do you say so?
ani'ayuntca' riiru'x-WA say-what-momentaneous-preterit-thoii I-to?
what did you say to me?
With enclitic -nia- LIKE (§ 19, 2, d) this verb means το CARE FOR
With enclitic -c u- AGAIN
(§ 19, 2, k) and followed by ai- τ ο SAY, pronominal 'an ia- denotesWHAT? e. g. rii' and Λ'qanC WHAT DO I CARE?
TOTEASE,e.g.","[223, 224, 225, 226, 227]"
"(2) A B S O L U T E V E R B FORMS. A S has been abundantly illustrated,
verb forms, even aside from nominal derivatives (§ 25, 1-6), often
appear without either enclitic or suffixed tense elements. Such
forms may be conveniently termed absolutes. They are used under
various circumstances:
(a) When tense (and pronominal) elements arc appended to another preceding word in the sentence, the verb appears as an absolute,
e. g.:Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE235a'itcayani qu'qwi then-preterit-him (vis.)-I shoot, then I shot him;
contrast qu'qwi'tea-yaw
I shot him
(b) In imperative forms (see § 52).
(c) Frequently in interrogative forms, where reference is had to
present time.
(d) Generally substantive verbs (aro'a-, uru'a-, § 56) have no
present suffix, present (or general) time being implied when there is
no tense suffix.
(e) Verbs of BEING and HAVING in -Icai- (§ 26, 1, a and b) take no -xjitoexpress present time, but are tenseless, e. g. qant!%aini I HAVE A
HOUSE.
It is probable that in such cases -Icai- represents an old
contraction of -kai-y'i-, as the -y'i- reappears after an intervening
impersonal 4-ua- (see § 29, 14; § 32, 8).
§ 52. The imperative.
The imperative is only negatively determined as regards form, i. e.
by the absence of tense elements, further by the frequent absence of
the second person singular in forms that have a pronominal or nominal
object. Syntactically, imperatives are remarkable in that they
take an object in the subjective form. The pronominal subject or
object, as usual, may be appended either to the verb or to a preceding
element, e. g. hortatory iVi'- (§ 60, 2, d). Examples illustrative of
these remarks are:
ivi""i drink-thou! drink!
avi'mituywa'""
it-out of-thou! go out!
iVi'"" ivi'yu hortatory-thou drink-momentaneous! go ahead, take a
drink!
qatcu"" wa'a'i]i{y)a'p-.\ not-thou shout-negative! don't shout!
OVL m-αχιιηι stiek-give-me! give me a stick!
man-3'q-3n\mwi io'n.-t all (obj.)-us (exclus.) punch! punch all of us!
p.i'qa'yuayA sari'Hv aijA kill-hiin (vis.) dog (subjective) he (vis.)!
kill the dog!
tona""ami punch-them (inv.)!
qwiri'k-ltsiaq• i'tci tVqa 'q-A arise-gerund (§ 55, 1, a)-it (vis.) this
(inan. subjective) eat-it (vis.)! after getting up, eat this!
vvwa'nfini
ya'yqihi
it (inv.)-at-being (subjective)-me carry-forhither! bring me (it) over there!
Imperatives with a dual or plural subject do not seem to occur with
enclitic pronominal subject, but arc characterized instead by anX Southern Paiute and Ute
236SAPIRenclitic -ya-, appended either to the verb form or a preceding word.
In plural imperative forms the verb is plural in form; dual imperatives,
particularly if intransitive, frequently add dual pronominal enclitic
. . .ml- to -ya-: -y'am'i-. Examples of plural and dual imperatives,
with and without pronominal objects, are:
ti''qa'q a(i)rA,tVqa'qai*e a t ye!qatcu'i' minta'n'ia'p-A not-plur. imper. run (plur. verb-stem)- negative! do not run away (plur.)!
tdyo'q wt.ya'ami run (sing. verb-stem)-imper.-dual! ye 2 run!
m\mwi'yani
to'nA ye-plur. imper.-me punch (sing, verb-stem)! ye
2 punch me!
tona'y'ar/WA ye 2 punch him (inv.)!
i(y)e'nuq(w)a(i)ya q-A this-at (§ 50, 4, l)-plur. subject-plur. imper.it (vis.)! here it is! (speaking to more than two; note idiomatic
use of imperative)
wTqa'm\yaAxqa'ami

qatcu'ya-m'i yaywi""(y)ap-A
not-plur. imper.-them (vis.) carry (sing.
verb-stem)-negative! do ye 2 not carry them 2!
What is probably an emphatic imperative is sometimes formed by
appending enclitic -aqa- to the verb or a preceding word. In all
probability this -aq a- is merely an idiomatic use of enclitic pronominal
-aq a- IT (VIS.); it has the position of a pronominal enclitic. T h a t it
is not to be merely construed as a pronominal object, properly speaking,
is shown by its use with inherently intransitive as well as transitive
verbs. On the other hand, it does not seem to occur where the verb
has a true pronominal object. Examples of imperative -aqa- are:
qa-'aq-Asing!t.iy;)'q wi{y)aq·A
toyo'q wiya q-Ago ahead and r u n !
ye 2 r u n !mvwa'yaq-A cv'paro'*
I-at-plur. imper.-it (vis.) assemble! do ye
come together at my place!
§ 53. Internal stem changes.
Verbal stem changes in Paiute that are of morphological significance may be classified under the heads of reduplication (see § 58,3-6),
vocalic modification, and consonantal affection. Only the two latter
are discussed at this point.
(1) VOCALIC ALTERNATIONS. Vocalic alternations are either quantitative or qualitative, the former, insofar as they are of morphologicalSouthern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageS O U T H E R N P A I U T E , A S H O S H O N E A N LANGUAGE237significance, being relatively infrequent. In all, six types of vocalic
alternation may be recognized.
(a) Vocalic lengthening. A short vowel may be lengthened, a long
one over-lengthened (e. g. a· to a-a), to indicate the idea of I N V A I N ,
TO NO EFFECT, e .g.:qa'aplya'
sang to no effect ( < qa - to sing)
'a'aip'iya'
said without effect ( < ai- to say)
α'τηραχαΐ
talks to no purpose ( < ατηρα'χαϊ talks)
'o 'n'niy'uq WA did it (inv.) in vain ( < un Crfitq-WA did it)
These examples indicate that it is regularly the first vowel of the
word which is lengthened.
Another group of cases of vocalic lengthening seems to be associated
with the idea of continuation. Examples are not very numerous:
pini rjw'in-q n uq WLXw'aim'arjWA look-stand about (-yw'ino- < -Tjwln-'Lto stand, assimilated by following -n vq tt>t-)-run-go-future-him
(inv.), shall go to stand around looking for him
Uni ' ^ u ' u m i do ( < t{m-)-subordinating-them (inv.), while they 2

tsi 'tsnjwayaip iyain C it seemed that (arrows) were stuck in in
several places (lengthened from normal reduplicated tsit si- >

Perhaps ma'ni-campaBARELY is similarly lengthened from

ya'aqwipiya'
entered, barely escaped by going over itit(inv.)-overbarely(b) Vocalic alternation to indicate number (and voice). In certain
verbs, the final vowel is a, a·, o, or u in the intransitive singular, i in
the intransitive plural and in the transitive. Examples are:
topa-qi(tree, feather, tooth)

qopi-n'nato break one;
qovi-tca- to break several
wiyum'mi- (Ute), also winom'mito jerk up one's buttocks (continuously)(c) Vocalic alternation to indicate aspect. In a few cases a final
-a- vowel of the stem when used iteratively (or continuatively) contrasts with an -i- of the stem when used semelfactively, e. g.:
up-vq-(w)i-to bounce (once)-q i- semelfactive intransitive (§
30,3)ovwoq(w)a-y(s)ito bounce up
and down
-ya- continuative intransitive (§
30,1)(d) Vocalic alternation to indicate active {-a·-) and mcdio-passive or
static (-<-). A very considerable number of verb stems alternate in
their final vowel between α• and i, a smaller number between yaand i. The former form of the stem is used for the active intransitive
(or transitional) voice, the latter for the medio-passive, static, or
resultative voice. The i- forms seem to be durative, the a - forms
tend to be momentaneous. Examples are:
i -p otsin'i-l- ai- to be ready to
start off
muntun'ni- to lie covered up
qji'ni- to hang together in two
parts
-m'unuqwito be round

appreciable difference in meaning between the i- and a- forms,
though this may be due to inadequate translation, e. g.:
tcuywito approach (tr.)
rin'ito be frightened, surprisedtcuywunri'ya•-dit.
dit.(e) Alternation of transitional -i- and static -a -. This type, apparently the exact opposite of the preceding, is sparsely represented,
e. g.:
to be fullpono'a•-jano'i-to become full( f ) Alternation of intransitive -i-, -a - and transitive -a-.
In these
verbs it Ls difficult to discover the difference in meaning between
the -i- and -a - forms (cf. d above). In some cases only -i- alternates
with -a-. T h e alternation of -i- and -a- is evidently an old Uto-Aztekan
feature; cf. such Xahuatl doublets as cotoni τ ο BREAK (intr.): cotona
τ ο WOUND, CUT; tomi τ ο OPEN UP (intr.): toma τ ο OPEN (tr.), DELIVER;
and numerous others. Paiute examples are:

lengthened vowel before
(2) CONSONANTAL AFFECTION. Two groups of cases are to be
recognized, glottalization and gemination of stem consonants. These
seem to be equivalent processes. Not infrequently they occur together in the same form, e. g. tska'pin'NA το CUT (momentaneously):
ts-kaniNA το CUT (duratively).
(a) Glottalization of verb stems. This process operates:1. To indicate distribution, e. g.:
fVA'tcü'ywiyuni
waijwi-fourseveral standyun a- to put several down (in
one place)wa'a'yWAtcÜTjwiyun C eight (lit.,
four here and there)
wa'a'rjwituip'iya' caused (them)
each to stand
yuna'(a)ito put down in several places2. To indicate iteration, e. g.:
iyon a- to carry in one's arms
ya-vayaito feariyan'na- to carry several times
yi'i-p-aq ai- to be afraid several
times (note irregular change of
-a - to -Ϊ -)3. To indicate momentaneous activity, e. g. -n'na- momentaneous
transitive with singular object: -n a- durative transitive with singular
object (§ 30, 4).
Glottalization alone as a grammatical process is relatively rare.
Generally it accompanies distributive or iterative reduplication (see
§ 58, 3 and 4), less often gemination alone (see b).
(b) Gemination in verb stems. Gemination primarily denotes
momentaneous activity; the contrast between momentaneous and
durative, as might be expected, tends to become one of singularity
and plurality. Gemination is very commonly employed with the
momentaneous suffixes -q i- (§ 30, 3) and -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c). Other
examples of momentaneous gemination are:Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanSOUTHERN PAIUTE,(iyai-A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGEto happennay am- to seem

tup un'ni- to wake up (at once)

-qi- momentaneous suffix (§ 30,3)Far less frequently gemination indicates iterative activity, e. g.:
qaqafi-to run awayya-vayai-to fearqaqat'ito run away several
times
yV'i-paqaito be afraid several
timesEven these examples are really but special forms of gemmation
accompanying reduplication. Combined gemination and reduplication, to indicate distribution or iteration, is common (see § 58, 3, h;
§ 58, 4, a, d, f).
§ 54. Singular and. plural stems.
All verbs are determined as regards singularity or plurality of the
subject, less often of the object also; the singular form includes
reference to the dual. The most common method of indicating
plurality of the subject is by the use of the suffix -q a- (§ 31, 1, c); for
other suffixes indicating or implying plurality of subject or object, see
§ 31, 1, a and b; § 3 1 , 2 , a-d. Vocalic alternation of the final vowel of
the stem is also sometimes associated with change of number (see § 53,
1, b). The idea of distribution expressed by reduplication often passes
over into that of plurality of the subject or object (see § 58, 3).
Besides these formal methods of expressing number, there are
certain verb stems that are inherently limited in their reference to
number, the singular-dual of the intransitive subject or transitive
object being expressed by a stem which is etymologically distinctX Southern Paiute and Ute
242SAPIRfrom that for the plural of the intransitive subject or transitive object.
Certain of these stem contrasts are:
qari- one sits, dwells
avi- one lies
w'in i- one stands
pa(i)yione returns
pit<A- one arrives
pay(a)ione goes, walks

in compound verbs. T h e whole verb may be characterized as singular
or plural in this w a y ; a pluralizing -q a- may thus become unnecessary,
e. g. ivi- O N E D R I N K S : im-k a- S E V E R A L D R I N K , but ivi-ywin-'i- O N E
DRINKS S T A N D I N G : iviywaywi- S E V E R A L DRINK S T A N D I N G .
Singularity
or plurality of the object is not disturbed by composition, e. g.
paq a-rjw'in 'i- O N E STANDS AND K I L L S O N E ; paq a-rjwaywi- S E V E R A L

pat.caqwi- one is (or gets) wet
tuywi- fire goes outqatcvn avitci- several get tired out
patcaq winavitci- several get wet
tuywinavitci- fires go out§ 55. Verb syntax.
Under this head may be conveniently grouped a number of phenomena that affect the verb in relation to other words in the sentence.
( 1 ) SUBORDINATING ELEMENTS.
Subordinate clauses, denoting
cause, time, condition, concession, or attendant circumstance, are
extremely frequent in Paiute. Those of these clauses that are used
with logical subjects put them in the objective form. Thus, a
sentence like WHEN I CAME, YOU WERE AWAY is rendered WHEN ME
CAME, YOU WERE AWAY.
In all probability the objective is in these
cases to be interpreted genitivelv, the subordinating element as a
specialized postposition; e. g. AT MY COMING, YOU WERE AWAY.
This receives some support from the fact that a few of the ordinary
postpositions may be suffixed to verb forms (see 2 below). However,
of the verb-subordinating elements only -yu- (see c below), possibly
also -qu- (see e), is employed also with nouns (see § 50, 4, 49). The262X Southern Paiute and Ute
244SAPIRtense elements -pa·- (§ 32, 4) and -q-ai- (§ 32, 3) may precede the
subordinating suffix, but not the other tense elements. Five subordinating suffixes are found, the first three of which introduce
clauses referring to the subject of the main clause, the other two
clauses with a different subject.
(a) -tsi- gerund. Subordinates in -tsi- are here termed gerunds
because they have no expressed subject, though they may have an
object. Their logical subject is always the same as that of the main
clause. They indicate antecedent circumstance or activity and
are most appropriately translated in English by participial phrases:
HAVING — E D .
I t is at least possible that the gerund -i st.- is etymologically related to the animate noun suffix -tsi- (§ 24, 1, f); such a sentence
as HAVING so DONE, H E RETURNED would then originally have meant

say-as-just
coyote fire-at-being (obj.) covered; as soon as Coyote said so, (he)

Concessive clauses of the same subject as the main clause are
formed by appending -c-ampa- (§ 19, 2, j) to -kai-, e. g.:
iya'xaxayqaic ampa yA though fearing him (vis.), (he went to meet
him)
(c) -yu- WHEN, WHILE, AS. This subordinating suffix seems to
be identical in meaning with -kai- (see b above). I t is suffixed only
to stems or verb suffixes ending in -ai-. I t always replaces -kai- after
verb suffixes ending in -ai- (e. g. resultative subordinate -q-ai-yuWHEN SAYING, not *-q-ai-yai-).
After verb stems in -ai, -kai- is
used (e. g. ai-yai- WHILE SAYING), unless followed by enclitic -c-ampa-,
but not, e. g., -cu- (hence ai-yai-c u-, but ai-yu-c ampa-).
Examples
of -yu- clauses are:

naijqa'q ai'yvq IVA when (he) heard it (inv.)
Clauses in -yu-cu-, analogous to those in -kai-c-u- and -ku-c-u-,
are found after verbal suffixes in -ai-, e. g.:

Translation. 1Wolf and his brother dwelt there. When it was early in the morning, Wolf sang, "" Go ahead, now! Go to our aunt and ask for grass
seeds.2 What are you doing, lying down and looking? "" "" All right,""
said Coyote, ""you are waking up now, but I have been awake long
ago, ever since it was early morning."" Coyote started off towards his
aunt's house, on his way to ask for grass seeds. To her there he went
and arrived at his aunt's house. His aunt was not there in her house,
only her two sons were sitting there in her house. ""Where is your
mother?"" said Coyote. ""She has gone to gather seeds,"" said the
two sons of Grizzly Bear; ""she will come back soon,"" thus they said.
Coyote waited, lying down there in her house, and soon his aunt
arrived. His aunt said, ""Soon you will eat mush,"" thus said his
aunt. ""Affer instrumentum meum masturbationis 1 quod ibi jacet,""
said his aunt, and the children gave their mother instrumentum
ejus masturbationis.
Their mother took it and lay on her back.
Coyote saw her and said, "" My aunt, let me do it for you by means
of this,4 my auntie,"" said Coyote, et cum amita sua copulavit.
""Enough 1"" said his aunt. "" N o , "" said Coyote, and Grizzly Bear put
her claws into his back flesh. ""Enough!"" said Coyote. "" N o , "" said
Grizzly Bear. Coyote got up quickly and ran off. Grizzly Bear arose
and said, ""Look at Coyote's back.""
Coyote returned home and lay down on his back, did not allow
(Wolf) to see it. His elder brother killed a young deer and brought
home his back flesh. Coyote was ashamed and did not allow his
back to be seen, but Wolf knew. Then he caused him to sleep, and
Coyote rolled over towards him. ""Did I not say so?"" said Wolf.
When (Coyote) rolled over, there was no back flesh of his there; in
its place (Wolf) fastened on the back flesh (that he had obtained).
Thereupon Coyote's back flesh again became as it had been.
Then Wolf again sang, ""Go on! proceed again to her and carry
this liver for her to eat. Then, having killed her, all things of her
house whereon she has been accustomed to look, all her things shall
you carry off on your back, having killed her,"" said Wolf. ""Yes,""
said Coyote. And then Coyote walked along towards his aunt's
house. Now he arrived there where were her sons—there the two
of them were staying in their mother's house. ""Here,"" said Coyote,""
is your uncle's liver which he says you are to eat."" The two boys
ate it and fell asleep. Coyote killed both of them, and then caused
them to appear to be sleeping.","[359, 360]"

partly by the fact that -p 'iyai- is treated analogously to -yai- (e. g.
participial -p 'iyanfi-, § 25, 6, e; negative -p 'i'ai-, § 57, 2, c), partly by
the fact that -p 'i- and -yai- may become disconnected (e. g. -ρ ϊ-a-yai-,

there is between the -p 'iyai- and the -p 'iayai- forms with possessive
-a- (§ 24, 2, a) is not clear. As for the use of the present -y'i-, it is
very likely that the -yai- of -p 'iyai-, when final, is to be understood asX Southern Paiute and Ute

§ 33. Modal suffixes.
There are only two specifically modal verb suffixes. Most modal
ideas, as we have seen, are expressed by the aid of enclitics (§ 19, 2).
The indicative has no special modal suffix; for the imperative, see §
52. For perfective -qai- as inferential, see § 32, 3.
(1) -yv-, (-qv-,) -T)qv- irrealis. This element indicates that the
activity expressed by the verb is unreal, i. e. either merely potential
or contrary to fact (potential in past time). In the latter case it is
preceded by perfective -q ai- (§ 32, 3) or narrative past -p 'iyai- (§
32, 6). I t is not used with present -yi- nor, it would seem, with future
-va·-71, -mpa-n.
Optative examples (WOULD THAT . . . . ! ) involving

"Introduction
The Great Basin of the western United States was, aboriginally,
occupied mainly by tribes who spoke languages of the Uto-Aztecan
family, specifically of the Numic branch. In older literature, this branch
is also referred to as ""Plateau Shoshonean,"" and the term ""Shoshonean""
has been used for a putative larger grouping within Uto-Aztecan.
Within Numic, three divisions are generally recognized. The Western
group includes language varieties labeled as Mono (or Monache) and
Owens Valley Paiute, in eastern California — plus Northern Paiute in
Nevada and Oregon, and Bannock in Idaho. Central Numic includes
Panamint (or Koso) in California; Shoshone in Nevada, Utah, and
Wyoming; and Comanche in the southern Plains. Finally, Southern
Numic consists of Kawaiisu in California; Chemehuevi and Southern
Paiute in southern California, Nevada, Utah, and northwestern Arizona;
and Ute in Utah and Colorado.
The term ""Paiute"" itself, unfortunately, has no clear ethnic or linguistic reference; nevertheless, the term ""Southern Paiute"" is well established as referring to some sixteen Numic ""bands"" or subgroups which
share a geographical center in southern Utah. (For a survey of Numic
linguistics, see Miller 1986.) Among linguists, at least, it seems likely
that the currency of the term ""Southern Paiute"" has been reinforced by
its use in the title of one of Edward Sapir's most important works.
Sapir's research on Numic began with a field trip undertaken early
in his career. After fieldwork on Wishram Chinook in 1905, on Takelma
in 1906, and on Yana in 1907, Sapir completed his doctorate at Columbia University in 1908 and accepted a position at the University of
Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1909, with his student J. Alden Mason,
Sapir arrived in Utah to study Southern Numic speech, beginning with
the Uncompahgre Utes at Ouray Reservation. Finding that few Indians
there spoke adequate English, he soon moved to the Uintah Utes at
White Rocks (see Sapir's letter to A. L. Kroeber dated 7 September
1909, in Golla 1984: 43). A brief report, ""Some Fundamental Characteristics of the Ute Language,"" was published in 1910 (Sapir 1910c,

Back at the University of Pennsylvania in 1910, Sapir hoped to find
a Ute speaker at Carlisle Indian School near Harrisburg; instead, he14X SouthernPaiute andUtefound Tony Tillohash, who spoke the Kaibab dialect of Southern Paiute.
Tillohash moved to Philadelphia for four months, providing Sapir with
much more comprehensive data than had been obtained on Ute (see
Fowler and Fowler 1986). Four short papers resulted shortly thereafter:
""Song Recitative in Paiute Mythology"" (Sapir 191 Od), ""Two Paiute
Myths"" (1910f), ""The Mourning Ceremony of the Southern Paiutes""
(1912c), and ""A Note on Reciprocal Terms of Relationship"" (1913c);
these are reprinted in Volume IV of The Collected Works. However, the
major descriptive result was Sapir's Southern Paiute Language — a
grammar, a text collection, and a dictionary — written in 1917, but not
published until 1930 — 31. This work is reprinted in the present volume,
along with a previously unpublished English index to the dictionary,
prepared by Wick R. Miller.
Sapir's work on Numic linguistics is noteworthy from three viewpoints
in particular. First, his 1910 report on Ute described the typical Numic
phonological alternation of voiceless stops (p t k kw), voiced stops (b
d g gw), voiced fricatives (ß r γ yw), and voiceless fricatives (φ R χ
Xw); in his work on Southern Paiute, Sapir not only found the same
alternation, but also confirmed Tony Tillohash's intuitive awareness of
the relationship. Reported in Sapir's famous article, ""La realite psychologique des phonemes"" (1933c, in Volume I), this finding remains one
of the paradigmatic examples of modern phonological theory. Second,
Sapir's Numic data made possible a historical study, ""Southern Paiute
and Nahuatl"" (1913f and 1915i) — his first important work in the
comparative/historical study of American Indian languages, and a pioneering application in the New World of the Neogrammarian methodology established in the Indo-European field. All subsequent activity
in comparative Uto-Aztecan linguistics is founded on this work of
Sapir's. Third and finally, the Southern Paiute grammar itself has come
to be recognized as a monument of American descriptive linguistics: a
model of accuracy, clarity, thoroughness, and insight which later scholars have striven to emulate.
In addition to data on language, Sapir collected ethnographic information from his Numic consultants, and organized these materials with
eventual publication in mind. The resulting manuscripts had an ""underground"" existence after Sapir's death, being consulted by several
ethnographers. They have at last been edited for publication in this
volume, by Catherine S. Fowler and Robert C. Euler, whose introductory essay explains the detailed circumstances.","[12, 13, 14]"
"§ 47. Noun and verb stem.
All Paiute stems end in a vowel or diphthong. A peculiarity of the
great majority of noun and verb stems is that they are primarily
disyllabic, e. g. qan iHOUSE;
fivwi-a EARTH; αΙ α-° SAND; ραγ(«){-"" τ ο
GO; qari-"" ΤΟ SIT; paq a-° ΤΟ KILL. The typical monosyllabic stem (or
radical) of so many languages is conspicuous by its comparative
infrequency; moreover, practically all monosyllabic stems have two
moras, e. g. qa -' ΤΟ SING, pai-"" ΤΟ CALL to -"" BLACK, O - S ARROW, pen-""
BLOOD. If expressed in terms of moras, the typical Paiute stem
would probably be found to have two moras, i. e. to consist of a
monosyllable with a long vowel or diphthong, or, far more frequently,
of two short-voweled syllables. However, disyllabic stems of three
moras (e. g. tu-γυ•- ΤΟ CACHE, Una - BOTTOM) are not at all rare.
Trisyllabic stems, of three or more moras (e. g. as ia - SURFACE,
tayoq wi- ΤΟ RUN), are also fairly common; stems of four or moreSouthern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE213syllables are rare (e. g. ttvwitsiya- ΤΟ OBEY). Were extended comparative Uto-Aztekan material available, it would no doubt be
possible to show that many of these trisyllabic and tetrasyllable
stems are capable of analysis. The two-moraed stem ending in a
vowel, of both monosyllabic and disyllabic structure, is clearly the
characteristic type of stem for all Uto-Aztekan languages.
Noun and verb stems are kept clearly distinct, the use of the same
stem now as noun, now as verb, being exceedingly uncommon. An
example is quq wa- WOOD, also ΤΟ GATHER WOOD (cf. English BERRY
and ΤΟ BERRY); note also ni(y)a- (two-moraed) ΤΟ CALL BY NAME,
but ni{y)a•- (three-moraed) NAME (it is quite possible, however, that
niya- really consists of niya- + possessive -α-, § 24, 2, a so t h a t niyawould be another example of a stem capable of being used either as
noun or verb).
From a strictly formal standpoint, noun and verb are, as we have
seen, carefully distinguished, there being very few grammatical
elements which are appended to both types of stem (e. g. diminutive
-tsi-, § 35; plural -q a-, § 31, 1, c and § 48, 2). However, there is a
slight tendency for verbs to be nominalized, without nominalizing
suffix, by means of nominal postpositions, but forms of this sort are
far from common (e. g. p'ivwa wim'jf aip a ntux wA WHICH-IN STANDPERFECTIVE-TO, TO WHERE ( H E ) HAD STOOD) ; see § 55,2. The clearest
syntactic indication of a feeling for nominal form is the presence of
article-pronouns (§42).
§ 48. Plurality of nouns.
There are two types of noun plurals: the reduplicated form, which
is more properly distributive in function, for both animate and
inanimate nouns (see § 58, 2 for these forms); and properly plural
suffixes, which can, for the most part, be appended only to noun
stems referring to animate beings (cf. the presence of singular and
plural animate forms and the lack of distinctively plural inanimate
forms in the third personal pronouns).
(1) ANIMATE PLURAL SUFFIXES. Two animate plural suffixes
exist, -ijw'i-' and -mi-', with exactly parallel functions and differentiated merely according to the preceding stem. These elements
apply to duals also, -r/w'i- is evidently spirantized from an older
-mi- (§16, 1); -mi- is the corresponding geminated (and nasalized)
form. Their Uto-Aztekan prototype *-me actually occurs as an
animate plural in Nahuatl {-mi).
In actual practice it seems hardlyX Southern Paiute and Ute
214SAPIRfeasible to assign -yw'i- to spirantizing stems alone, -m-'i- definitely
to all geminating (and nasalizing) stems, as their range of usage
seems to intercross with that of types of stem; thus, nominal -tsi-n
(§ 24, 1, f) forms plural -tsiyw'C-, while participial -ti-n (§ 25, 6) forms
-tim 'i-. No simple rules can therefore be given for the use of -yw'ior -ιιι ϊ-.
(a) -mi- (subjective); -m-ϊα- (objective). Examples are:
naya'mi
mountain sheep (sing. na'x A)
qA'qa'rami
quails (sing. qAzqa'w)
tciya'mi
ducks (sing. ici'x-A)
a(i)ya'm'i
turtles (sing. α'ΪΑ)
wTtca'mi
roadrunners (sing. wi't cA)
a'ivam iratjWA our (inclus.) young men (sing. a'i<t>Apits· young man)
yu'tami
Utes (sing, yu-'t-a-ts··, plur. also yu 't a tsajw'i)
In the last two examples a nominalizing suffix of the singular
(-ρ-'ttsi-, -isi-) has been dropped before the plural suffix. This is not
common; but cf., further, sari't'i'qami
ARAPAHO I N D I A N S (lit.
DOG-EAT-PLURAL, noun-verb compound noun; sing. sari 't Tqats ).
Animate plural -m 'i- is also appended to cardinal -yu- of numerals
for TWO and above, when used attributively with enclitic -n ta-,
before animate nouns, e. g.:
waa!(i)yumuni
wi'tsi'tsiywiarjA
two-cardinal-animate plur.-like
great-grandchildren-plural-her (vis.), her two great-grandchildren.
(b) -ijw'i- (subjective); -Tjwia-, rjwa(·)- (objective). The objective
in -rjwa{·)- is very common; it is merely a phonetic variant of -tjwia(see §4, 1, a). Examples of subjective -r/w'i- are:
nava'virjwi
reciprocal-elder brother-plural, two brothers

paa'yw'i aunts; paa'rjwini my aunts (sing, paa'ni my aunt)

are formed by suffixing to t h e verb, in a m a n n e r analogous to subordinate forms a l r e a d y discussed (see 1 above), certain nominal
postpositions. Examples h a v e been found of verbal local subordinates
in -p a - (participialized -panti-,

-p a ntuywa-, § 50, 4, 38; -p a yu-, § 50, 4, 38); -va- (§ 50, 4, 37); and
a p p a r e n t l y -yu-nia- (§ 50, 4, 49). Doubtless several other postpositions m a y be used to m a k e s u b o r d i n a t e clauses of local reference.
(3) P R E S E N T F O R M S AS L O O S E S U B O R D I N A T E S . N O W and then a
verb form in present -yi- (§ 32, 1) occurs as a sort of loosely employed

( 4 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF PARTICIPLES.
Participles are extremely in
evidence in Paiute. They are employed in a variety of syntactic
ways:
(a) Attributively, when they may often be translated as relative
clauses or as adjectives.
(b) Denominatively, e. g. to'ywant'i FIGHTING > FIGHTER, secondarily HAVASUPAI INDIAN; uvwa-'nt aRi THERE-BEING IT, THE THING
THAT IS THERE.(c) Adverbially, particularly with verbalized postpositional forms,
e. g. tümpwi'a-ij 'am-nÜA p\rn'ka ROCK-OBJ.- HE (VIS), IT-AT-BEINGOBJ. LOOK, i. e. HE LOOKS THERE AT THE ROCK rather than H E SEES THE
ROCK THAT IS THERE.(d) Predicatively after verbs, particularly substantive verbs, e. g.
t'itc aro""ami ayan an-i'ntci THIS (INAN.) IS-USITATIVE HOW DOING?
HOW DOES IT WORK? qatcu an ik- %ijwaTjw'ait 'i NOT DOES RAINING
(NEG.), IT DOES NOT RAIN.(e) In lieu of finite verbs, particularly after independent personal
pronouns. Such participles may be considered as special cases of
predicative usages (d), the substantive verb being omitted. They
refer to general time as a rule. Examples are:
a'imintim'i say-usitative-participle-plural, (those) wont to say, (they)
always say
rii' to'ywanii I fighting, I am a fighter
i'mi cii'xaxwai't-uim-inünl
thou squaw-bush-get-go-causative-usitative-participle-me, you always cause ine to go to get squaw-bush
twigs
( 5 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF ADJECTIVES.
Practically all adjectives are
properly verbal in form. As such, they may be predicatively employed, like any verb; or, in participial form, attributively or denominatively (e.g. ""'a't 'i tiyo'qwdci
GOOD-BEING RUNNING, GOOD
RUNNER). They may also be employed, in their bare stem-form,
as the first, rarely second, elements of noun compounds (see § 18, 1, d
and e).
A few adjectives are properly nominal in form, e. g. imaf'p'its·Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE249i-'tump'i
OLD. An independent adjective may be used
attributively to refer to an incorporated noun, e. g.:
SMALL;mia""p 'itsiA wana' Rup'iya' little-obj. net-make-past, made a little net
§ 56. Substantive verbs.
Substantive verbs are
formed from the demonstrative stems a- and u- by means of a verbalizing -ro'a-: am'α- το BE (vis.), uru'a- το BE (inv.). These forms may
be used with all nouns, animate or inanimate, and independent
pronouns. These simple forms are also used as the nucleus of a
set of substantive verbs of specific pronominal reference, composed
of the pronouns urjwa- HE, um-'C- THEY, and uru- IT, to which are
respectively appended (not phonetically suffixed) aro'a- for the visible,
uru'a- for the invisible, forms. I t is remarkable that the u- pronouns,
which are properly invisible, should be used in visible substantive
verbs as well, visibility and invisibility being expressed by the a- or uof the verb proper. The pronominal substantive verbs thus are:
( 1 ) FORMATIONurjw aro'a-OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.h e is (vis.)umw aro'a- they are (vis.)
ur aro'a- it is (vis.)uy uru'a-h e is (inv.)urn uru'a- they are (inv.)
ur uru'a- it is (inv.)These may be conveniently written as single words, e. g. uraro'aIT is (VIS.). The present tense of substantive verbs is designated
either by the normal -y'i- (§ 32, 1) or, more frequently, by the
absence of a tense suffix. The substantive verb may also take on
other tense suffixes, the modal -νϊ - (§ 33, 2), the usitative suffixes
(§ 30, 10 and 11), the participial -η-, and the nominal abstract
-na(§ 25, 3).
( 2 ) U S E OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.(a) In perhaps the majority of cases the substantive verb follows
and is phonetically disconnected from its predicate noun or subject;
an adverb, however, may precede and the predicate noun follow the
verb. In these cases the final vowel of the word preceding the
substantive verb is elided. Examples are:
cina'rjwav aru""a coyote it-is
''itc aro""ami' qa'tcu quna""ap-A this (inan.) be-usitative not firenegative, this (that we have been burning) is not fire

'a'(i)yuxvp·
vruru""ai'
good-irrealis-past passive partic. it-is (inv.)present, it would be good
(b) A second method of employing substantive verbs is to attach
them to the preceding predicate noun or subject (noun or independent
pronoun), a glottal stop separating the a- or u- of the substantive
verb from the preceding final vowel, which is preserved; e. g. iici'
'aru'a- this (inan.) i s beside ''itc aru'a-. Perhaps such forms as iter'
'am'a- may be considered as verbs with incorporated nominal (or
pronominal) subject (§ 18, 2, f, t); e. g. Hci""aru'a~, cinaywavi'urywaro'a-.
Forms of this type are obligatory for independent pronouns of the
first and second persons. Examples are:
sari 'tcL dro'"" dog it-is
na'a'ints tsi' aru'"" little-girl it-is (absolute: na'a'intsits )

(c) The idea of B E I N G OF, B E L O N G I N G TO is normally expressed, as
illustrated above in several examples, by preceding the substantive
verb with an objective form of genitive significance, e. g.:
ni'niaru' aro' aro""anA me-interrogative is being, is it being of me?
is it my property?
n\'ni \waru"""" me he-is, he is mine
imi' 'uraru"" (aru""anA) thee it-is (being), it is yours
By a curious idiom, however, the logical owner is sometimes put
in the subjective, the thing owned in the objective, as though the
substantive verb were to be translated directly as ΤΟ OWN, e. g.:
itci'an aro""ai' this (inan.)-obj.-I be- present, this is mine, I own this

The following sketch of Southern Paiute, which was completed in
December, 1917, is offered as a contribution to the scientific study of
the Shoshonean languages. Whether or not it proves to be fairly
typical of the whole group in phonologic and morphologic respects
must be left to future research.
My first field acquaintance with Shoshonean linguistics was gained
in a short trip during August and September of 1909 among the
Northern Utes of Uintah Reserve, Utah. This trip was undertaken,
with the collaboration of Dr. J. A. Mason, under the auspices of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. A number of Ute texts
were secured, supplemented by considerable grammatical information.
To extend and deepen the insight into Plateau Shoshonean linguistics
then obtained it seemed advisable, indeed necessary, to undertake
further researches. Hence arrangements were made by the late
Dr. G. B. Gordon, Director of the Museum of the University of
Pennsylvania, with the authorities of the Indian school at Carlisle
to have one of their Paiute students, Tony Tillohash, put a t my
disposal for the ethnologic and linguistic study of his tribe. I worked
with Tony, who proved to be an excellent informant, in Philadelphia
from February to May of 1910. A series of texts, much supplementary grammatical material, a large number of songs, and considerable ethnological information were obtained. The Paiute
linguistic data proved so much superior to the Ute which I had
previously secured that I have decided in this sketch to limit myself
to the former. Moreover, there is enough phonetic, lexical, and
morphologic difference between Ute and Southern Paiute to render
the attempt to describe both at the same time confusing. I hope to
publish a briefer sketch of the Ute language at some future date.
The present volume is to be followed by a series of Southern Paiute
and Ute texts and by a Southern Paiute vocabulary. I t is a great
pleasure to recall the unflagging patience and helpfulness of Tony
Tillohash and the kindness with which Dr. Gordon did all that lay
in his power to make these studies possible. My thanks are due Miss
Jane McHugh, the Secretary and at that time Acting Director of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, and the authorities of the
Museum for permission to have these Paiute studies published by theX Southern Paiute and Ute
4PREFACEAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences. To Professor Franz Boas I
owe a special debt of gratitude for arranging with the Bureau of American Ethnology that I prepare the present paper, later transferred to
the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, and for his more
recent efforts in enlisting the interest of the Academy in the publication of my Southern Paiute manuscripts.

used as objects (direct or indirect) of transitive verbs; as subjects of
subordinate verbs (§ 55,1); and as genitives. Examples of independent

An independent subjective pronoun may be combined with an independent
objective one, the former apparently preceding, e. g.:imi ηϊ'ηίΑ pAxqq.'umpa n iA thou me wilt-kill
rii' pAxqo!Tjurjum""ι mwimwiA
I kill-you (plur.) you (plur. obj.)
As a rule, however, only one of the pronouns is independent, the
other being attached as an enclitic (see § 40, 6).

Most of the enclitic
pronouns may be used either subjectively or objectively. The
objective forms of the second person are formed from the corresponding subjective forms by the addition of -m i-, perhaps identical with
the -m i - of independent m i - T H O U ; - y n m i - < -Tjw'imi(§ 3, 3, d).
The dual animate enclitic -' . . . m i - is a subjective element; it is
outwardly identical with
. . .m i.'-, the third person plural animate
invisible element, but, though in certain cases very difficult to keep
apart from the latter (which, when the verb is singular in form,
necessarily has a dual reference), is clearly distinct from it, as it may
refer to all animate persons, including the third person animate
visible. -®i- is only used in a possessive sense and is evidently somewhat in a class by itself. The position of the pronominal enclitics
with reference to other enclitic elements has been already spoken of
(see § 19, 4).
The enclitic pronouns are closely related, for the greater part, to
the corresponding independent pronouns. The first person singular
-ni- is connected with, though not identical with, the independent
rii', ni-; this vocalic alternation is probably an old Uto-Aztekan
feature, cf. Nahuatl independent ni I with proclitic ni- I, ME. The
other enclitics of the first person are identical with the corresponding
independent pronouns, t- becoming spirantized to -r- (-tc- after -i-).
The -' of the second person singular is entirely peculiar to the enclitic series; - ψ ν ϊ - and - r j u m i - of the plural are doubtless spirantized
from *m'i{m i ) - , cf. independent m 'im i-.
The visible forms of the
third person are compounded of demonstrative -a- and the pronominal
elements -rja-, -m 'i-, and -q a- already discussed in § 39, 1. The
invisible forms are compounded of an accessory -'- and the same pronominal elements, a -w- being inserted in the animate singular and
wwX Southern Paiute and Ute184SAPIRthe inanimate. This
. . . -w- may be a specialized form of
demonstrative "" ' « ' - THAT (invisible). T h e reflexive possessive -v'iseems to have no independent analogue, unless, indeed, it be connected
with relative pi- (§ 45); cf. probably also Shoshonean *pi- HE, HIS
(Cahuilla pe HE, pehe- HIS; San Juan Capistrano po- HIS).
(2) USE OF SUBJECTIVE FORMS. The subjective enclitics may be
used as the subject of a non-subordinate verb or as the object of an
imperative (§ 52).
The animate dual -' . . .πιϊ-, however, of
which examples will be given separately, functions only as a subject,
sometimes also as a possessive. Subjective examples of enclitic
pronouns, attached both to verbs and to other parts of speech, are:

they (inv.) are good
7nwava'ami qari'p 'iya' there-they (inv.) dwelt(vis.) do-usita-In connection with the use of second person singular -' certain
peculiar contraction phenomena are to be noted. Ordinarily the
pronominal -' does not amalgamate with a ' in the last syllable of the
word to which it is attached (e. g. from -ywa'ai- ΤΟ GO IN ORDER TO
is formed ηα'υ,'ψναίχινα'αί''
GO THOU AND HANG THYSELF!), but inSouthern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE185other cases such amalgamation takes place, so that no specific pronominal element is apparent at all. This is notably the case with
interrogative -ru'a-, e. g.:
im'yiro'"" art thou drinking? ( < -ro'a- + -'; not -ro'a')
cu(w)a'ru' nyn o'c C maybe you'll dream
Probably this difference of treatment has something to do with the
difference between inherent and accessory ' (§ 15, 1). Furthermore,
the pronominal
is lost in certain cases, notably after qatcu- NOT,
after demonstrative ai- (§ 43, 5), and before ai- τ ο SAY and ani- τ ο
DO; a final -a is then elided before following a-. Examples are:
qatcu' n a 'n ia'ap-A not-thou say-negative, do not say anything
a'i(y) igiT a'iimA that-obj.-thou indeed say-usitative, you are indeed
wont to say ( = ai-a- iy'ir, cf. a'ian iy'ir that-I indeed)

αχα'ηίχαί 'anik -.i what-do-subordinating-thou do? why do you do
so? ( = -jfoi' *ani-)
The third person inanimate enclitic pronouns (-aqa- and -' . . .q wa-)
are very often used, as in English, in an impersonal sense, particularly
in references to the weather. Examples are:
u7)wa'(i)y'iaq A it is raining (said by one who sees it raining)

it is raining (said by one who does not see it rain)
nia'va n-i'aq-WA it will blow

Subjective examples of animate dual -' . . .m l- are:
mami qa 'y'tmi they 2 (vis.) sing (not equivalent to qa 'y'imi they 2
inv. sing, as ma'mi implies visibility, but to qa 'yiam'i they 2 sing;

in qa 'yiami merely implied because of singular form of verb)

of transitive verbs, as subjects of subordinate verbs, and as possessives.
For their use in subordinate verb forms, see § 55, 1. Possessives,
exemplified only in noun forms, are treated below (4). Examples
of enclitic pronouns in a properly objective sense are:

with nouns. Inasmuch, however, as such an enclitic, even when
appended to a noun, can have objective (or, in most cases, also subjective) significance, a theoretical ambiguity sometimes results. Thus,
a form like qam'anl HOUSE-OBJ.-I (or ME, MY) may be interpreted
as signifying either MY HOUSE (obj.) or I (DO so AND so το) A HOUSE.
The form of the whole sentence or the context generally removes
the ambiguity. In practice a noun with possessive enclitic is generally
followed by a postnominal article-pronoun, e. g. qani'an am MYHOUSE (OBJ.) IT, in which case no ambiguity is possible. Examples
of possessive enclitics are:
purjqu'm my horse; qu'tcu'mpuyquTjwini my cattle (lit., buffalo-pets)
dci'nipA'tca'n-cc'RI to*to'q wa'ar/q'ithis-me mocasin-myitpatch(distributively)- for, patch these moccasins of mine for me
fiyi'virarm

A'SI'a-(i)ya'Q WA its surface, bark (obj.)
nia 'viy'wa m,· aijA chief-possessed-their (vis.) he, their chief
pi{y)a""am'i their (inv.) mother
Instead of -am'i- THEIR (vis.) and -' . . .m i- THEIR (inv.) are
sometimes found the corresponding singular forms -αηα-, -' . . .rjwa-.
This takes place, though not always, when the person referred to by
the enclitic pronoun precedes with the plural animate suffix -ψνϊ(-TO I-; § 48,1), evidently in order to avoid a double plural. Analogous
phenomena will meet us again (§ 41, 1, e; § 42, 2 and 5). Examples of
this ""number dissimilation"" in possessive forms are:
qum a'rjwia m,· αηΑ ma 'ai>LTjWAhusband-plural-objective-theirhe( = them; § 42, 2, end) chief-his (inv.; = their inv.); their-husbands206X Southern Paiute and Ute

below)
""'a't iywayw'ia'aywA good-possessed-plural-obj.-his (inv.), their (inv.)
good ones (anim. obj.), good ones (anim. obj.)
The reflexive possessive -vi- occurs only in objective forms, i. e.
after objective -a-, -ya- (§ 49, 1); after nominalizing -n a- (§ 25, 3); and
after postpositions, which are syntactically equivalent to the objective (§ 50, 3). The reflexive possessive indicates t h a t the possessor is
the same person as the subject of the sentence. Ordinarily it refers
to the third person, but it may also be employed in first and second
personal references. Examples <)f its use are:

Explicitly plural (or dual) forms of the third person reflexive possessive are also found; they are compounded of -am 'i- THEIR (vis.)
or -' . . .m 'i- THEIR (inv.) and -®ϊ-, theoretical
. . .m 'ivi- appearing,
however, as
. . .movi-, - . . .m-auv'i-. Examples are:
qaTu'va ntuxwa ami^i
to their own house
puyqu'tsia mi^i their (2) own dear horse (obj.)
ροτο'ιη'αηιαιιφϊ, -ιηοφϊ with their (2) own canes (cf. pars'>ηα(υ)φϊ
with his own cane); pan'q (w)ama("")mau£i
with their own canes
(for -q a- see § 48, 2)
Explicitly dual forms of the reflexive possessive are made bySouthern Paiute, a Shoshonean207LanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE189compounding -vi- with animate dual -' . . . M V : -νϊ'ϊτηϊ- THEIR 2
OWN. This form, as contrasted with -' . . .ηι ουϊ- discussed above,
shows clearly t h a t third person animate plural invisible
. . .m 'iis not identical with animate dual
. . .m-ϊ-, though it seems sometimes to intercross it in usage. Examples of -νϊ'ϊιη ϊ- are:
naw'<t>itsii)wamiyu' a'plyai.i'qa'mitu'cu'naijApi(y)a'(i)yavi'imitwo-brothers they carried-it (vis.)-dual grinding-her mother-obj.own-dual; the two brothers carried w h a t she, their (2) mother,

(5) PLEONASTIC FORMS.
Double (or even more frequent)
expression of pronominal elements is very common in Paiute. Examples of the repetition of the subjective or objective pronoun, both
pronouns enclitic or one enclitic and the other independent, have
occurred in preceding lists. There is a marked tendency for the
objective enclitic pronoun to attach itself to the verb even if it is
elsewhere expressed in the sentence; in transitive sentences the
enclitic subject seems to be normally attached to the verb only in
combination with the enclitic object (§ 41, 2, a). Particularly characteristic is the employment of enclitic possessives together with
genitives (i. e. objectives) of the corresponding independent pronoun, e. g.:
n'i'mA pavi'lsinime my-elder brothermaya'iA ραα'ατ/Λ h i m h i s - a u n tpi 'xäSiTj'w'im imi'A pigs-thy thee, thy pigs
imi'A paa'i'ami thee aunt-obj.-thy, thy aunt (obj.)
Pleonasm is abundantly illustrated also in nouns, which are often
anticipated or redundantly referred to by pronouns, independent or
enclitic. Of such usages also examples have already been given.
Particularly frequent is the occurrence of an objective enclitic pronoun
of the third person with an objective noun, e. g. ι SEE-IT HOUSE (OBJ.)
as equivalent of ι SEE HOUSE (OBJ.). In genitive constructions this
is almost the rule, e. g. ραα'ία η.ι qaniar/A AUNT-OBJ.-HIS HOUSE-HER,
HIS AUNT'S HOUSE; also paa'iarjA
qanl.
