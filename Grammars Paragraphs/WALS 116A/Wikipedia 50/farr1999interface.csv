"4.7.2.3 POLAR QUESTIONS
Polar interrogative sentences often terminate with one or two tag words: ai? 'yes?' or ai
tefa? 'yes or no? ' . In declarative sentences, the copula in topic-comrnent clauses and the
final syllable of the verb in verbal clauses are pronounced with a falling pitch and may even
be devoiced. However, in polar questions, this syllable is often lengthened and distinctively
terminates the intonation contour to which it belongs. In many of the cases, it is assigned its
own intonation contour. The contour begins with a falling pitch, then manifests a slight--.- --Chapter 4148rising pitch and an optional falling pitch. The tag question words may also manifest
rising-falling(-rising) or falling-rising(-falling) contours. The frequency range for the
following examples l ies between 80 and 220 hertz, slightly higher than the range for
declarative sentences and content questions. Polar questions terminate at a much higher
pitch than do declarative sentences, except when the tag question word tefa occurs.
Sentence accent in polar questions slightly modifies the stress patterns for individual words,
especially that of future tense verbs. This is illustrated in the examples below. Example
4. 1 06 has no tag words.

"If the final verb in 6. 1 9 were indicating that the sentence has the illocutionary force of a

Although the final clause o f an SRC may not contain the focal element questioned, it still
contains the only verb in the SRC marked with the speech-act value for content questions. In
example 6.20, the interrogative pro-word rejo 'what specifically' occurs as the object of the

'What did you throw that while the dog is eating (it), he is growling?,The nominal+verb combination gangara resi ' is he growling?, is the only verb that is

indicates the illocutionary force of the entire sentence. If it were marked as a statement, it
would be gangara resira 'he is growling' .
6.2.3 OPERATION OF NEGATION IN SRCs
Of the co-ranking and chaining sentence constructions in Korafe, SRCs are the only type
that allows several negative bracketing options. Negative bracketing structures may be
manifested: ( 1 ) within one clause in the chain, (2) by a few clauses together, or (3) by the
entire lexical series in the chain, other than the auxiliary verb terminating the sentence.
The two markers of negation, namely the negative focus marker jo ' not' and the negative
deverbal : stem I of verbs and ae 'not doing' usually bracket the segment within which
negation holds. 1 2 Each medial verb in the chain defined by the negation markers i s
interpreted as sharing the irrealis status and negative polarity of the negative deverbal
which terminates the chain.
12In SVcs verbal predicates must lie within the scope ofjo and the negative deverbal; negation of one
verbal constituent does not occur withjo. Bases in co-ranking structures must be individually negated.",[211]

' That white man (that) gave us the money, John hit him, and he died.'
In example 2 .48a, ojeni marked with the speech-act value marker { -i} terminates the
sentence. The ojena marked by { -a} is the predicate of the dependent base in 2.48b, an
adversative sentence.
2.48a. Na=mo oka gay-ari=daese-doI S=TIF fish spear-DVB=PUR say-Ss.sEQ

' As for me, I came to spear fish, but why in the world did I act this way

Although the use of the speech-act value markers { -a} and {-i} is primarily fixed in
Korafe, there are some contexts where the choice of { -a} or { -i} depends upon the speaker
and the perspective he or she wishes to communicate. Hence in example 2.49a, the speaker
uses {-i} instead of the expected {-a} marker to indicate his strong desire to meet up with
the other person. His use of {-a} in 2.49b indicates that he is not really committed to a long
search.

find.I-F . I S.FN' I will go, but I doubt I ' ll find him. (The chances of finding him are very slim.
There are just too many obstacles.)'
In example 2.50a, the {-i} signals a proposition that the speaker believes the addressee
does not share with him, so he asserts it. In 2.50b, the {-a} signals a proposition that the
speaker assumes he and the addressee both presuppose.
2.50a. Na uju + erena,Jamie fur-aettI S want+IPF .do. PRES. I S.D Jamie come.DUR.IPF-CFAC.3S.AQ' I would like Jamie to come. (But I 'll understand if the answer is no.)'

Jamie come.DUR.IPF-CFAC.3S.FN'I would like Jamie to come. (And you and I both know it's expected that
Jamie be there. I won't take no for an answer.)'
From the above examples and others arises the hypothesis expressed above, that the
speech-act value marker { -i} registers the speaker' s commitment to the factuality or
desirability of the ideas being expressed; the use of the speech-act value marker { -a} does
not. The { - a} marks presuppositions and uncompleted events that do not require the
speaker' s wholehearted commitment to their validity or desirability, because the addressee
shares them with the speaker or at least is assumed to share them, or they are not firmly
established as facts. Past events can be validated, so they are encoded in sentences that
assert them as facts, sentences terminated by a final verb marked by { -i} or by the copula
rio This hypothesis is less satisfactory as an explanation for the fixed uses of { -a} with all
third person indicative forms and { - i } with all content questions ?4 An alternative24One might posit that content questions are marked with { -i} , because the very utterance of the content
question signals the speaker's commitment to the actual existence of the item in question or the actual or
projected occurrence of the event for which information is sought.","[60, 61]"
"16The question then arises: are all svcs lexemes? Or is there more to being a lexeme than being a unit in
the memory? As §5.4 points out, not all SVcs have the full set of characteristics of lexemes, in spite of
the fact that they may be memorised units. We' ll return to this question in Chapter 9.",[196]
"40Chapter 2In addition to occurring with past tense final verb forms, the { - i } is the terminal
recurrent partial on final verbs that are predicates of content questions. Even though both
examples 2 .45 and 2.46 utilise the today' s past tense paradigm, the second person singular
verb forms having indicative mood 2.45a and predicating a content question 2.45b do not
differ in form, but the corresponding third person singular forms illustrated in 2.46a and b
do differ.

"1 90Chapter 6sentences do. The same interactive features that indicate the illocutionary force of a simple
sentence illustrate the illocutionary force of an SRC. These features (discussed in §4.7) are
reviewed here and illustrated.
( 1 ) The SRC can contain one and only one dependent or independent final verb, marked by
a speech-act-value marker, {-i}, -a, or -e in accordance with the specifications given in
§2.3.3.
(2) The frequency and amplitude contours in the rhythm group(s) assigned to the SRC
follow the patterns illustrated in §4.7 and its subsections for statements, content
questions, commands, and polar questions or they terminate with a fal ling rising
intonation contour which characterises presuppositional material. Pauses can occur SRC
internally.
(3) Only one modal particle (or two tag words, e.g. ai te/o 'yes no?') can occur at SRC
terminus; they cannot occur SRC internally. Only one evaluative word, such as avose
' perhaps' , may occur sentence-initially or after the subject NP in the initial clause.
Pause words, such as avori 'all right' can occur several times in an SRC .
The following SRC has the illocutionary force of a statement. The epistemic modal asi
'thus said' occurs at its terminus. It contains two clauses, which fall under the scope of one
rhythm group with five intonation contours: ( 1 ) na (2) ya-ma (3) a- (4) -fa (5) ga-re-na-si.

Korafe has one other complement structure encoding customary verbal action. This noun
phrase has three constituents : ( 1 ) a genitive PP modifying (2) the nominal head (comprised
of the periphrastic verb sequence encoding sporadic iteration), followed by (3) a
demonstrative ava. This complement construction has object function (cf. discussion of the
object (0) function on page 1 1 6) in the matrix clause in which it is embedded. The referent
of the possessor is coreferential with the referent of the subject of the dependent final verb
in this construction. The English gloss of example 3 .47 could be translated by a gerund
'their doings', but the Korafe has a fully inflected dependent final verb.",[99]

"1 44Chapter 4Korafe statements manifest a variety of intonation contours. The only predictable
intonation contour is the final one, which is a (3- 1 ) or (2- 1 ) downglide that frequently
terminates with devoicing of the final vowel or syllable(s). For all but example 4. 1 02, the
fundamental frequency range in declarative examples is 80- 1 801 1 90 Hz. All of the
examples terminate at 1 00 Hz or below. Example 4.99 is a declarative sentence filled by a
topic comment clause.

'I am a sea-dwelling woman, belonging there. 'The amplitude and frequency curves below reflect Bensted Keghana's interpretation of
example 4.99. The utterance is 2.946 seconds long. The topic na 'I' is the longest syllable
(39 1 milliseconds). The loudest syllable at 63.9 (-39dB) is e in eva 'sea' . The syllable ka in
joka has the highest pitch ( 1 73 . 1 Hz). The most accented syllable is e in e va, with the
greatest amplitude and the second highest pitch ( l 7 1 .8Hz). This correlates with the purpose
of this sentence: to emphasise that the addressee's brother was responsible for removing the
speaker from her home environment, the ocean (eva). The final syllable ri is very low in
pitch (87.7 Hz) and amplitude (2.6 (-3 1 .7dB)).

analysis, a was perceived as the accented syllable in the auditory analysis, perhaps because
of the fall in pitch before it and the 2 1 5 millisecond pause before it. The re of the verb
ambarena ' I will die' is the longest or stressed syllable ( 1 53 milliseconds) in the verb,
indicating that the focal constituent is not the verb. If the verb were the focal constituent of
the utterance, the ba ( 1 2 1 milliseconds) would be stressed. Again, the lowest pitch (84.8
Hz) and the lowest amplitude ( 1 .7(- 1 3.4dB» occur at the utterance terminus.
In example 4. 1 02, the verb again has a future tense form. The stressed ya signals that the
verb yarira ' he will go' is the focal constituent of the utterance.
4. 1 02 Nu=mo y-arira.
3S=TIF
go.DUR-F.3S.FN
'He must go.'
There is only one focal constituent in this sentence, yarira. The ya in yarira is the longest
(342 milliseconds out of .999 seconds for the total utterance) and the loudest ( 1 8.61 46Chapter 4(- 1 4.5dB)) syllable. The topic constituent nu 'he' is given the highest pitch, 1 7 1 .7 Hz, in
contrast to ya at 1 50.2 Hz. Korafe speakers use the topic marker rno in this context to signal
that this event must occur. This sentence also terminates at the lowest pitch ( 1 00.7 Hz) and
amplitude (.9( - 1 4.6dB)).

Content or information-seeking questions always manifest two components: ( 1 ) a
content question pro-word (e.g. rnave 'who?', rejo 'what?' , nange 'what event?, how?') and
(2) a predicate with the modal orientation suffix for assertions and content questions, {-i} .
The question pro-word is the constituent given focus function. It either occurs near the verb
or in the position of the word it is replacing. In the following examples, the inherently
stressed syllables of both topic and focus constituents are accented. In both of these
examples, the topic word contains the longest syllable with the highest pitch. The focus
pro-word contains the syllable with the greatest amplitude. Content questions resemble
declarative sentences in having a variety of intonation contour patterns and terminating
with a downglide.
The content question in example 4. 1 04 is realised by a topic-comment question.
4. l 03 Ni rnave-jo=ri?
2S whO-SPEC=COP.AQ
' Who are you?'
The topic ni 'you' is 269 milliseconds long and has the highest pitch ( 1 96.7 Hz). The
syllable ve of the focal constituent rnavejo has the greatest amplitude (2 1 .5(- 1 3 .4dB)). The
lowest pitch (94.0 Hz) and the lowest amplitude (2.8(-3 1 . 1 dB)) occur at utterance terminus.

(29.7 (-1 0.6dB)). Although ri is perceived as receiving word stress as expected with future
forms of verbs, the instrumental reading does not indicate it. The syllable ya is longer ( 1 4 1
milliseconds to 4 7 milliseconds), higher i n pitch ( 1 22.3 H z to 98.9 Hz) and greater in
amplitude (2 1 .0(- 1 3 .6dB) to 9.3 (-20.6dB)). The last syllable ri terminates abruptly with a

(-23.6dB)�9.3(-20.6dB)�7.4(-22.6dB), but those differences do not seem to be significant
enough to mark it as the stressed syllable.
Rhetorical questions occur with the same features as content or information questions,
but the pro-word is usually marked by aimi 'by means of that' or the intensifier kata, as in
nangetiraimi? ' how in the world?' and rekata? 'what in the world?'.

No rhetorical questions have been processed using the C E C I L program. But auditory
analysis suggests a higher frequency range for rhetorical questions than content questions
have and a greater fluctuation in amplitude occurring with the focal constituent than its
counterpart in content questions manifests.","[163, 164, 165, 166, 167]"
"SVCs1 55modifiers present in the construction. Non-contiguous SVcs allow nominals and modifiers
to intervene between any two verbs in an SVC.
The term ' serial verb sequence ' (SVs) is also used to refer to the sequence of verbs,
whether contiguous or not, as opposed to the entire SVC.
The main questions that attach to the analysis of SVCS in Korafe (and other languages)
are : ( 1 ) are some or all SVCS analysed as a single clause, as a reduced clause sequence, or
something different from the notions, clause or clause sequence? (2) Are SVSs not only
single predicates (if the single clause analysis is chosen), but single lexemes? (3) If entered
in the dictionary, how do we describe the role assignment of SVcs? These questions will be
taken up in detail in a later section.","[174, 175]"
"CHAPTER 4CLAUSES, PREDICATES, PREDICATIONS AND SENTENCES4. 1 INTRODUCTORY REMARKSThis chapter surveys Korafe clauses/predications and briefly outlines the structure and
intonation patterns of simple sentences.
Clauses roughly correspond to the semantic notion of full predications, i.e. predications
with both participatory and circumstantial semantic arguments. The predication types
detailed in the following sections are based on the correspondence between the number of
core arguments that can occur and the semantic roles these arguments play. Predication
types in Korafe are either stative or active. Non-verbal clauses and clauses with iri ' remain'
express states of affairs. Other verbal predicates express events, the verb stem being an
""event classifier: a verb stem denoting a kind of action [or process] , conceptually simple or
complex"" (Pawley 1 987:33 5-3 36).
Simple sentences have two basic components: a base with accompanying prosodies.
Because the base of a simple sentence corresponds syntactically to a clause and
semantically to a predication, predication types are presented first in the fol lowing
discussion. The simple sentences surveyed in the final section of this chapter are:
statements, content questions, polar questions, and commands.","[128, 129]"
"The demonstrative ailaimi combination has an additional use as a marker of rhetorical
questions. It marks the interrogative verb nangetira 'how did it happen?' in example 3 . 1 36.",[126]
"5.4 BONDING AND THE CLAUSAL STATUS OF svcs
The relationship of the clause to the svc has long been a matter of debate8 among
linguists. There is no simple answer to the question. Are they lexemes, predicates, clauses,
or something more than a clause? The degree of integration or bonding between verb stems
in SVCS can be measured by several variables: ( 1 ) the distance between verbal predicates,
8West African language scholars Williamson ( 1 965), Boadi ( 1 968) and Stahlke ( 1 970) posited that
some SVcs are derived from multisentence underlying structures, but Schachter ( 1 974:262) proposed
that ""a verb phrase concatenation"" rather than a multisentence underlying structure is all that is
necessary. Li and Thompson ( 1 973) saw the possibility of both multiclausal and multic1ausal SVcs in
Mandarin. Baker's ( 1 989) object-sharing analysis, Schiller's ( 1 989) auto lexical semanticosyntactic
analysis, and Durie's ( 1 992) fused conceptual structure (that follows lackendoffs linking theory to
assign more than one semantic role to an N P ) are all attempts to explain a multic1ausal analysis,
especially of those cases where ""each transitive verb in the series has its own object (Schiller
1989:405).""",[185]
"5.6 WHY DOES KORAFE HAVE TWO CHAINING CONSTRUCTIONS?
The Korafe utilise chaining constructions (svcs and SRCS) to streamline their accounts
of events. Members of the Korafe community share in many common cultural routines,
which they represent in event schemata with standard sequences of lexical verbs. These
sequences may be compressed into SVCS under certain conditions. Under other conditions,
each verb in the sequence may predicate a clause in an SRC. The use of these familiar
sequences provides an automatically retrievable unit which frees both speaker and
addressee to focus on the novel aspects of the particular discourse. NPs and inflections can
be stripped from these structures because of syntactic co occurrence restrictions.
Demonstrative-based conj unctions are by and large not needed, because chaining sequences
ipso Jacto are temporally conj oined, fol lowing the iconic ordering of the events
represented. 1 2
But why have two chaining systems, SVCS and S RCS? 1 3 Bruce ( 1 986:26) answers that
question by noting that Alamblak restricts SVCS to ""those [event sequences] which express
culturally determined commonly associated events"". He adds, ""any sequence of events may
be talked about in juxtaposed clauses [which he i llustrates with an S RC], but not every
sequence of events may be described by a serial construction."" Reesink ( 1 987: 1 44- 1 47)
concludes from his study of Usan verb sequences that ""stripped-down"" SVCS merely ""tie
two verbs mentally closer together than would be the case when these events were
expressed by full medial verbs"".
The answer for Korafe lies somewhere in between Bruce's and Reesink's perspectives.
Korafe SVCS and SRCs certainly can be constructed using the same verbal lexemes. The
recurrent verb sequence buje base 'get, gash and puncture' with medial verb and verb stem
variations was discussed above in examples 5 .3 8 and 5 .40. The verbal sequence in 5 .47a
and b also contains close to the same sequence of verbs: ( 1 ) processing the raw material (be
it flooring or wall boards) [keve ' shave off orje 'chop'], (2) getting it [bu] , (3) coming [fu]
1213Even so-called 'simultaneous' medial verbs are positioned within the sequence according t o the iconic
ordering of the events they represent. Overlap is rarely total in Korafe, so these events too have their
niche on the time-line before they overlap with another event. For further discussion, see § 1 1 .2.3.
Part of the answer is, of course, built into the grammar. One must use an SRC to encode a change of
subject (excepting the apparently anomalous cases, detailed in Chapter 7). However, the use of ss
SRCs vs. SVcs does involve the kind of choices we are treating in this section.",[193]
"16

1819The '( ' occurs only suffix-initially with e-verbs. Other verbs (u-verbs and i-verbs) occur with -eni, -esi,
etc. in the today's past tense. Fuller details are given in §2.3 .2.4.
Both {-a} and {-i} may occur as the fmal speech-act value index on verb forms using the counterfactual
paradigm. Section 2.3. 1 .3 details the use of these speech act value indices.
The enduring past paradigm is rare and seems to be disappearing. There is a suppletive set of endings
beginning with -i, e.g. -ia-n-a, -ia-s-a, instead of -ua-n-a, -ua-s-a. Both refuira and refeira 'he was
coming along' are attested, and there seems no way of ascertaining which is ' right' at this point in time.
The { -i} speech-act value that marks predicates in content questions occurs in the current data corpus
only with first person forms in the hortative mood.",[57]
"2.3 FINITE VERB FORMS-THE SUFFIX SETS
Korafe finite verbs are either final verbs or different-subject medial verbs. They are
inflected by three-part suffix sets that indicate the following categories: ( 1 ) tense-aspect­
mood/status distinctions, (2) person and number of subject and (3) speech act value. The
final verb suffix sets are given in Table 2.3. Although the recurrent partials constituting the
suffix sets are for the most part isolable, the third person singular forms are not. Another
difficulty in segment interpretation arises in the hortative forms; the hortative mood suffix
sets are encoded by the concurrence of specific initial and terminal partials. Therefore,
these partials are outlined in their respective ' slots' in this section and then treated as
composite or portmanteau suffixes in interlinear segmentation for the rest of this book.
In Table 2.3, where there are two sets of forms in the column, the initial set ending in{ -a} is the dependent final set, and the second set ending in {-i} is used with content
questions and some assertions. The set used in a particular tense for indicative is indicated
by an asterisk ( * ) , following the suffix form.",[56]
"I S day=COM.D go.DUR-F. I S.FN
'I will go tomorrow. (You thought I'd already gone. No, I ' ll be going tomorrow.)'Pauses separate the external or pragmatic functions of theme and tail from the main
sentence base(s). Pauses are signalled by punctuation marks such as commas and full stops
in written texts. For examples with themes and tails, see §3.2.3 . 1 . Pauses also mark rhythm
groups, which contain one or more intonation contours and are equivalent to coherent
informational units or thematic clause chain units (TCC us) in sentences. A fuller
explanation of TCCUs is given in §9.3. The intonation contours and amplitude graphs that
characterise statements, questions, and commands are illustrated in §4.7 and its subsections.",[114]
"14Chapter 1Vowel iength 20 is phonemic and is written as VV. Heterogeneous vowel sequences occur
as bimoric complex nuclei in syllable rhymes. The oral set includes all possible
combinations but 'uo'. The nasal set is limited, with only the second vowel being nasalised
in several cases: 'iii', ' ill , 'ei' , ""eu' 'ai' '01' , and 'ui' . A few words exhibit lengthened
vowels occurring in heterogeneous vowel sequences as complex V1V2V 2 nuclei in a syllable
(e.g. aii 'yes', kiuun 'sneeze').
Korafe has the following syllable patterns: v, CV, VV, CVV, VVV, CVVV.
Korafe words are stress-timed, with longer words pronounced in approximately the same
time as shorter words. Primary stress within a word is associated with a 'heavy' syllable, a
syllable which is uttered for a longer duration than the other syllables in the word. For
instance, a spectograph of an utterance of beka ['beg.kh a] 'mouth' indicates that [beg] was
uttered for 2.29 seconds and [kh a] for 1.69 seconds. In a similar word biM [big.'kh a]
'sister-in-law' receiving stress on its second syllable, [big] was uttered for 1.36 seconds and
[kh a] for 2.29 seconds. A heavy syllable may also manifest increased amplitude and a
higher pitch.
Stress is predictable for most of the words in Korafe. Non-verbs and verb stems manifest
word stress on: (1) the initial syllable of words with two syllables (2) the second syllable of
words with more than two syllables, or (3) the first (c)vv(v) syllable (when this pattern
occurs). In inflected verb forms, 2 1 stress falls on the initial vowel of vowel-initial suffixes
following either the verb stem or an imperfective morpheme when one occurs in post-stem
position. When an imperfective morpheme is not present and the suffix begins with a
consonant, stress falls on the stem vowel or the classificatory vowel. Where stress is not
predictable, an acute C) accent is written over the most sonorous vowel in the stressed
syllable.
Some basic Korafe intonation contours are illustrated in Chapter 4. More detailed
information on allophonic variation, phonotactics, and other aspects of Korafe phonology is
given in FaIT and FaIT ( 1974: 5-38).
1.6 TYPOLOGY
Korafe is morphologically agglutinating, primarily hosting suffixes and enclitics. It
exhibits both head-marking and dependent-marking strategies:20
21head-markingdependent-markingclausespredicates
auxiliary verbsoblique argumentsnoun phrasesnounsqualifiers
possessorsIn Farr and FaIT ( 1 974:26), this vowel length was interpreted as word tone. And a slight down-glide
often does accompany the lengthened vowel.
There are two other subsidiary rules for the today's past and future tense paradigms that constitute
exceptions to this general rule. These are: ( I ) stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable when a today's
past tense verb form has more than two syllables (e.g. seteni 'I said', tendeni ' I lashed', but beni ' I got'),
and (2) stress perturbs from the initial syllable of the future tense suffix to the second syllable when the
focused element in the clause is not the verb (e.g. Na yarena ' I will go', Na Tufi yarena ' I will go to
Tufi. ).
'Introduction15The unmarked order of core constituents i n the clause is subject-object-verb (sov), but
word order of clausal constituents is fairly free with the one stipulation that the verb be last.
In fact, the verb is the only constituent of the clause that obligatorily occurs. Any argument
that is recoverable from the discourse context or the external deictic situation can be elided.
Korafe distinguishes two major open word classes: nominals and verbs. Nominals
include words that correspond to the categories: noun, qualifier, quantifier, numerator, and
adverb in English. Processes that apply to nominals include inflecting for plurality,
intensity, and/or specific focus, but nominals usually occur without inflections. As is typical
for Papuan languages, verbs are morphologically complex, undergoing agglutinating and
fusional processes which link stems with their corresponding inflections. Verb forms differ
from nominals in the inflectional categories they host, intensification strategies, and the
stress rules that apply to them.
Closed word classes having referential function in discourse are personal pronouns,
interrogatives/indefinites, and demonstratives-deictics. Other closed word classes include:
postpositions, conjunctions, and sentential focus markers. Interjections, response words and
greetings are numerically limited, but the Korafe repertoire is expanding to include English
interjections and responses.
Postpositions often cliticise to the preceding noun phrase or sentence base that they
relate to a larger construction or to the discourse deictic context. They function as: ( 1 )
semantic case role markers, (2) markers of pragmatic functions, and (3) modal indicators.
Markers of semantic case roles and pragmatic functions are enumerated, and their
function(s) with noun phrases are specified in Chapter 3. Some combinations of these
postpositions with nominals, personal pronouns, demonstratives, and interrogatives/
indefinites are lexically frozen (e.g. sovenida ' across from' , eloda ' on top of' , ikxida,
dengesida 'beside', all nominals occurring with the general locative postposition da to
specify a position).
Epistemic and deontic modals terminate sentence bases and left-dislocated themes. The
speaker uses these indicators to declare his or her orientation or attitude towards the deictic
situation detailed. They include: vae 'I'm exasperated', ta ' I ' m annoyed' , lano 'probably
so', tanojo 'perhaps', asi 'certainly (a-si, that-saY.II.evidential indicating reported speech)',
re 'relevant to the immediate deictic situation' and the related demonstrative sets ere, are,
ore which spatially link the event to the speaker, the addressee, or some place away from
both.
Four personal pronoun stems occur in Korafe: na ' 1 ' , ni 'you' , nu 'he, she,it', and ne
'you (pL)/they' . Frozen combinations of these stems with enclitics are used to make dual
and plural as well as first person inclusive and exclusive distinctions. Only pronominal
stems occur with the actor focus suffix -ne and the limiter -suka 'only ' . The nominal
10/0/1010/0 ' self/selves' is used as a reflexive form or to emphasise the subject in a clause
(which is usually a pronoun). Reciprocal relationships are signalled by t% t% .
Interrogative and indefinite words arise from four basic stems. Two are basically
pronominal : ave/mave 'who' and re ' what' . The referential specifier -jo (avejo ' who
specifically?') and semantic case role and pragmatic function markers occur with these two16Chapter 1pronominal forms. The stem ningi 'which' always combines with forms that are based on
,
the demonstrative a 'that' (ningia 'which one?'). The verb stem nange 'how (lit. do what)
is the only Korafe verb that may be followed by the comparative postposition go/gao In
content questions, the question word retains the same position in the clause as its
antecedent except in the case of subject where OSV order often occurs.
All members of the Binandere family manifest the same three-way set of demonstrative
stems: e 'this near the speaker', a 'that near the addressee' , and 0 'that away from both ' .
Markers o f pragmatic functions directly follow demonstratives (amo 'regarding that one',
ava 'that as opposed to any others'). Modal enclitics also occur with the demonstrative set
(amasi 'regarding that certain one'). Semantic case role markers or the pro-verb ge 'do
(FOCUS)' follow one of the pragmatic effector of change markers i or mi (aindae ' on
,
account of that', aminda 'there', aminge 'do thus'). The term 'deictics 22 encompasses the
entire range of demonstrative-based forms.
Korafe contrasts with some Papuan23 languages in having upwards of 20 conjunctions
and conjunction complexes, which are related to demonstrative forms and/or same-subject
medial verb forms. An inventory of these forms and their functions in co-ranking sentences
is catalogued in Chapter 8. Their function in SRCs is outlined in §6.2.4.
Sentential focus particles include the negative focus marker jo ' not' , the proposition
specifier nu 'this proposition selected from the available ones', taka 'just, frustratingly' .
Sentential focus words such as avose 'perhaps (lit. that. CT. say)' and avori 'all right (lit.
,
that.cT.coP) may also occur in isolation as response words. Other than jo which precedes
the negated constituent in focus, these sentential focus markers either occur sentence­
initially or following the subject and are often set off by pauses from the rest of the
sentence. Tag markers for polar questions (e.g. ai 'yes?', ai tefo 'yes or no?' ) also belong to
this class. However, they are set off at the terminus of the sentence by pauses.
Interjections (termed yove in Korafe) are a small set of uninflected words and fixed
expressions that the Korafe employ to express emotional reactions (e.g. mara 'what a
shame' , arie ' wow! '). Among the response words and expressions the Korafe use are:
aavori 'that' s sufficient', aii 'yes' , and aiyakoe or tanik yu 'thank you' . Like the sentential
focus particles, interjections and response words may be set off from an accompanying
sentence by pauses; but more normally they are uttered in isolation associated with an
intonation contour that can display considerable pitch variation. Greetings and farewells
(termed ategi in Korafe) occur in isolation or with a vocative expression. The current daily
greeting Sifo eveva! ' Good day ! (lit. day good)' has largely replaced the traditional
greetings using present tense forms of verbs (e.g. /resa! 'You are staying! ' , Refesa! ' You
are coming! ', Ravasi! 'You have slept! '). Command forms of verbs (e.g. Anumbeyo! 'Sit ! ' ,
/yo! ' Go ! ' , A viyo! ' S leep ! ') continue to b e used a s farewells. Interj ections and other
utterances that are shouted at a distance terminate with an -0.","[33, 34, 35, 36]"
"The scope of negation may cover either a single predication or a sequence of
predications within SRCs. Examples illustrating the scope of negation in SRCs can be found
in §6.2.3. The scope of negation cannot extend beyond a final verb, however. Therefore all
bases in co-ranking sentences must be individually negated. In example 4.92, the verb aira
'he went' terminates the predication in the positive sentence base, and the predication in the
subsequent antithetical base is negated.

' It is true that he went to the house, but he didn't get the knife.'
As illustrated in the previous examples, predications that are statements (4.90) and
questions (4.9 1 ) are negated by jo 'not' at the onset and ae ' not do' at the terminus.
Commands are negated by using the negative hortative form of the final verb. The scope of
negation in a command can be optionally marked by placing {era} 'don't' before the initial
constituent to be negated. Examples 4.93a and b illustrate negative prohibitions without and
with {era } .

"4.7.2.4 COMMANDS
All imperative sentences have the illocutionary force of commands. They are expressed
in order to get the addressee to modify his or her behaviour in some way. Commands are
manifested by independent clauses that terminate with an imperative (having the -u speech­
act-value marker when plural or imperfective) or a hortative form of the verb. Korafe
hortative and imperative final-verb paradigms are detailed in §§2.4. 1 0, 2.4. l 1 and 2.4. 1 2.
The Korafe commands are uttered at a higher frequency range than any other sentence type,
between 1 05 and 260 Hz.
Commands generally differ from other sentences in that they do not have topical
constituents, unless an addressee is mentioned. The peak of the intonation contour with the
highest frequency is consistently above 200 Hz, higher than peaks of intonation contours
found in most other sentence (except in some instances of polar questons). They also tend

The SRC functions as a sentential unit, either as a presupposition 1 1 or as a proposition
with illocutionary force. In the latter case, only one illocutionary act is performed when the
SRC is uttered. This illocutionary act can be either ( 1 ) a statement, (2) a question, or (3) a
command. An SRC cannot contain both a statement and a command, as some co-ranking11The term 'presupposition' is used here to refer to something the speaker assumes as given for the
context in which he or she makes his utterance. This pretheoretical defmition is basically pragmatic,
opposing presuppositions with assertion. It is not a ' semantic' notion, defmed in terms of truth­
conditions, opposing presuppositions with entailments (Lyons 1 977:600).",[209]
"Occasionally, however, the negative deverbal, occurring without jo, intervenes in a
string of verb stems. The role played by the deverbal in these cases is unclear. Does it form
a nominal+verb combination with the verb stem e ' do ' , which is not phonologically
distinguishable, and function as a constituent of the svc? If it does not, is it marking the
terminus of an svc that functions as an oblique manner argument of the following verb or
as a participial modifier of the subject? A good example is 5.32, taken from the translation
of Luke 1 3 : 7.

' We looked for (it), and not seeing it, we were fl ummoxed . . . 'The Korafe men questioned disagreed on how this construction should be viewed, although
all of them insisted that a phonological j uncture (marked by a comma) occurs at the
interface of gae 'not seeing' and bune 'not know'. The two younger men said that gae 'not
seeing' should be written gae e ' do the act of not seeing'. If the younger men's option is
correct, the combination gae+ e 'not seeing+do' should be a constituent of a contiguous
svc. Why, then, do they assert that a comma is necessary, as if it were a non-contiguous
svc?
The older man adamantly insisted that only gae 'not seeing' should be written. With this
option, it is necessary to posit two svcs, the first one being tava e gae 'having looked for
and not seeing ' . Since it is phonologically distinct from bune jaredo 'not know and give up
hope' , tava e gae 'having looked for and not seeing' cannot be a manner argument of bune
'not know' . However, it can be an svc acting as a participial expression that modifies the
subject. This option provides a more satisfactory explanation of the construction.",[185]

1 .4 HISTORY OF CONTACT
The Korafe-Mokorua speech community stands at the juncture between Austronesian
and Papuan language groups on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. Korafe kiki
'traditional stories' allege that their ancestors orginally emerged from a hole in the ground
between Nembadi and Ferorode in the Bareji River area. Some time in their prehistory they
moved on to Ghooro near the mouth of the Musa River. About 1 50 years ago (according to
oral traditions), they made a series of forced moves, related to clashes with the Baruga,
Miniafia, and Ubir groups, and ended up at the head of Maclaren Harbour. They settled to
the north and south, killing and marrying the Kerebi people,9 an Austronesian group living
in the area.
The Mokorua (or Yegha) peoplelo were located with the Yega group near Gona
(Killerton), north of Oro Bay. They also migrated to the Cape Nelson headlands, settling
mostly toward the north end of the cape. Their specific movements are not currently
reconstructable. The Mokorua now speak Korafe but regard themselves as a distinct group
from the Korafe. I I
Located among the Korafe-Mokorua community are the Arifama people,12 who speak a
dialect of Miniafia, a language group living south of the Korafe, mostly on the north side of
Collingwood Bay. The Miniafia-Arifama speech community belongs to the Austronesian
family (see Map 3). The Korafe have borrowed from neighbouring Austronesian groups a
number of lexical items, particularly those pertaining to canoes, fish, and root crop varieties
(e.g. ghaka 'canoe', samano 'outrigger' and sia 'fish').","[28, 29]"
"APPENDIX 5
SIKURU DA GEKA ' SPEECH ON PRIMARY SCHOOL MAINTENANCE'
by Kenneth Mota, age 50
July 1 98 1This hortatory discourse (vironu ' speech') is on the general topic of school maintenance,
in particular keeping the grass cut. As is customary for public speeches, the audience is
formally addressed. In this case, the speech is addressed to the general populace, the P . and
C. members, the school board members and the teachers.
Kenneth resorts to commending, cajoling, pleading to their sense of fairness, and
threatening them with school closure.
As is common in hortatory discourse, the final verbs occur in several different tense
forms. In spite of the fact that this is a hortatory discourse, not one imperative form is used.
The speaker relies on the second person plural contrafactual and future forms to frame his
commands politely. To drive his point home more forcefully, he uses a rhetorical question
in the fourth paragraph and evaluations in the third, fourth, and fifth paragraphs.
The formulaic closing is typical of Korafe speeches.","[463, 464]"
"These structures make use of four pragmatic functions : THEME, TOPIC, FOCUS and TA IL.
THEME and TAIL are external to the predication proper and occupy the special positions, P2
and P3 respectively. TOPIC and FOCUS are internal functions of the predication. In the
schema that Dik ( 1 979:2 1 ) proposes, the P I position is ""taken by elements from special
categories of constituents (e.g. questions words) or is used for constituents with Topic or
Focus function"" . In Korafe, when a TOPIC NP is overtly present in predications terminating
with verbs, it is always in the PI initial position in the predication. But a constituent bearing
FOC U S function may not necessarily be in the initial P I position. In the second Korafe
pragmatic structure, FOCUS is normally associated with the COMMENT constituent.",[115]

' While 1 was getting my spear, the pig went (away). (today)'10This distinction may shed some light on the development of the Korafe medial verb forms. Haiman
( 1 983 : 1 26) suggests that DS forms in some languages arose from a combination of the VERB + PERSON,
yielding a subordinate verb form that is indifferent to switch-reference, to which was added either a
nominaliser or a conjunction. (Korafe still has a few sets of medial verbs that are homophonous with
the dependent final verb forms: the same-subject sequencing realis durative [span] verb forms.) Korafe
speakers index switch of subject reference by adding a final -0 post-verbally to the 'tense' forms that
are used to convey real is or irrealis correspondences. Possible sources of this -0 are the distal
demonstrative 'that, away from speaker and hearer' or the disjunctive conjunction 0 'or', used in polar
questions and other bi-polar alternations. The Korafe demonstrative 0 is a nominaliser, and the
disjunctive 0 is a conjunction. Clauses embedded by demonstrative topic markers function as
arguments in the subsequent clause, but medial verb clauses do not function as arguments of
subsequent reference clauses. Therefore, one can hypothesise that it was probably the disjunctive
conjunction 0 'or' that became the signal of switch-reference, because it was used so regularly with
the dependent final verb that fusion has eventuated. It seems appropriate to indicate discontinuity of
subject with a disjunctive conjunction.",[206]
"4.7.2 SENTENCE TYPES
4.7.2 . 1 STATEMENTS
Statements or declarative sentences are manifested by clauses that are unmarked by
distinguishing grammatical particles or constructions. Clauses terminating with either the
copula or final independent verb forms in the past tenses (other than third person singular
forms) are marked as definitely asserted by the speech act value marker { - i } . Clauses
terminating with present, future, and third person singular verb forms occur with the neutral
speech-act value marker {-a} . Declarative sentences occur with all the modal particles. The
speech-act value marker is apocopated when sentences terminate with the current relevancy
marker (ere/are/ore) and/or the reported speech evidential (asi).
2021Four relative pitch levels, used to explain intonation contours in English, are helpful in the auditory
analysis of intonation contours in other languages (Pike 1 945 :25-26). These can be labelled extra-high,
high, mid, and low respectively and can be numbered /' 1 for low pitch, 121 for mid-pitch, III for high
pitch, and 141 for extra-high pitch, following Trager ( 1 972: 84).
Pike ( 1 945 :24) discovered that ""there are many more contours than one for question and one for
statement"". Because of his findings, he abandoned a grammatical or lexical definition of intonation
contours in English, preferring to defme them ""in terms of attitudes of the speakers"".",[163]

yaresa 'you will go' with ya at 29.4 (- 1 0.6dB) and tela 'no' with te at 27.2 (- 1 1 .3dB)). He
assigns the highest pitch to ya in yaresa (2 1 2.2 Hz as compared with ni which registers
1 7 1 .8 Hz at its highest pitch level). The longest syllable is ya in yaresa at 25 1 milliseconds;
the focal element, ai 'yes', is second longest at 242 milliseconds. Thus, the focal
constituent yaresa is the most accented element in the utterance, ranking first in pitch and
in length and a close second in loudness.
Seko assigns the highest pitch to the topical component, ni 'you' (2 1 3 .0 Hz as compared
to ya in yaresa 'you will go' which registers 204.6 Hz). The ya in yaresa has the greatest
amplitude in the utterance (32.9 (-9.7dB) as compared to the te in tela ' no' at 24.8
(- 1 2 . 1 dB)). The longest syllable is ai 'yes', at 284 milliseconds, ni is second at 274
milliseconds, and the ya in yaresa is third at 26 1 milliseconds. In the initial auditory
evaluation of this utterance, the focal constituent yaresa appeared to be the most accented
element to all of us listening to the tape. However, the instrument measurements indicate
that yaresa and ni are pretty much on a par. The focal yaresa ranks first in loudness and is
second in pitch and third in length, while the topical ni has the highest pitch and is second
in length and third in loudness.
Because the focused constituent is the centre of the message the speaker intends to
communicate, it tends to be the most accented element. But, as demonstrated above, the
topic also may be strongly accented. Focal constituents that frequently draw the strongest
accent to them are: ( 1 ) the final lexical verb in a verbal predicate or the stressed word
before the copula in copular predicates, (2) the negative deverbal ae ' not do' in negated
clauses, (3) focus words, such as the focal actor pronouns, the negative specifier ja and theClauses, predicates, predications and sentences1 43proposition specifier nu, and (4) the interrogative pro-word in content questions. The
Korafe can indicate two significant focal constituents by signalling one with increased
amplitude and the other with higher pitch. In the sample taken, the greatest amplitude is
consistently associated with a syllable of a focal constituent. In over 80% of the cases, the
syllable with the highest pitch also belongs to a focal constituent, but only 1 8.3% of the
examples assign both high pitch and loudness to the same syllable. A syllable belonging to
the topical constituent registers the highest pitch in 25% of the examples and the greatest
length in 50% of the examples.
The examples illustrating sentence types in the following sections were recorded by
Kingsley Seko (KS: age 65) and Bensted Keghana ( BK: age 5 1 ) in February 1 995 at Baga
village in the Tufi district of the Oro Province. At that point, an auditory analysis using four
relative pitches20 was made both by the men and this writer. Although accent was originally
perceived as high pitch in the auditory analysis, the instrumental analysis by computer
revealed it was only in a little more than half the sentences that high or very high pitch was
the predominant feature associated with syllables perceived to have the greatest accent. For
the others, increased loudness and, occasionally, length played a more significant role. The
computer-produced graphs of amplitude curves and intonation contours convey a more
accurate and complete picture than the 4-pitch auditory analysis, so they are presented with
the examples in the following sections.
The examples illustrate some trends in the use of intonation contours, loudness, and
length in Korafe sentences. However, the speaker's attitudes at utterance time and motives
in making the utterance also influence the shape of intonation contours, the assignment of
loudness and length, and the positioning of pauses, overlaying and modifying any general
patterns there are. 21 A complete study of the prosodic combinations that are associated with
attitudes such as doubt, relief, joy, grief and anger is beyond the scope of this book.","[161, 162, 163]"
"CHAPTER 9STANDARDI SED SEQUENCES OF VERBS AND THEMATIC
CLAUSE CHAIN UNITS (TCCUs)This chapter examines standardised ways of expressing particular types of events and
situations. It takes up the question: How are things said in Korafe?
In a much-cited passage, Chomsky ( 1 965 :4) stated that a grammar of a language should
be a systematic description of the linguistic competence of native speakers, competence
being ""the speaker-hearer' s knowledge of the language"". Echoing this view, Radford
( 1 988:3, 27) indicates that ""a model of a native speaker's competence"" is ""a grammar that
tells us what we need to know in order to be fluent in a language"", a grammar being ""a
finite system of rules which generate . . . the infinite set of well-formed sentence-structures in
the language"". In the structuralist grammarian's view, the lexicon is part of the grammar,
lexical items being the form-meaning pairs in a language, morphemes and idioms, that are
unpredictable by the rules of grammar. I
Pawley ( 1 985 :87-90, 1 994 : 7- 1 8, 27) argues that this ' grammar-lexicon model' presents
2
an ""impoverished account of linguistic competence"". He argues that a proper speaker
should show nativelike standards in: producing grammatical utterances, pronouncing words
and adhering to conventional intonation, stress and rhythm patterns, being able to decode
fluent speech, knowing the idiomatic way of saying things as opposed to ways that are
merely grammatical, distinguishing between standardi sed expressions and ad hoc
descriptions, and saying the right thing at the right time.
Drawing on the work of Grace ( 1 987), Pawley proposes an alternative view of languages
as ' subject matter codes (or languages)' . A description of a subject-matter language would2In recent years, the scope of the lexicon generativists propound has been extended from a minimalist list
to include: ( I ) more grammatical information about individual lexemes and (2) forms that were initially
derived by rules of morphonology and syntax, e.g. nominalisations. However, it still differs considerably
from dictionaries that lexicographers make. Pawley ( 1 986: 1 0 1 ) lists a number of morpheme sequences
that dictionaries like Webster 's have but grammarians would count as literal expressions, formed by
productive processes, hence not included in their lexicons.
The term 'grammar-lexicon model' is from Grace ( 1 98 1 ).
In the 1 960s, Pawley sought to do a grammar and lexicon of Kalam, a Papuan language. Feeling
dissatisfied both with his grammatical description and early drafts of the lexicon, he ( 1 993 : 1 03) makes
this comment: ""My thesis . . . failed to record some of the most distinctive and quintessential
characteristics of the language. The analysis did not give the reader much idea of how the Kalam
actually say the kinds of things that they say. The most productive patterns for reporting events and
situations, for instance, were not distinguished from those patterns that were grammatical but
unidiomatic"" .","[308, 309]"
"CHAPTER 1 1COHESION, PROMINENCE AND DOMINANCE IN KORAFE
NARRATIVE DISCOURSESIn discussing relationships that underlie discourse, Grimes ( 1 975) distinguishes three
sets: ( 1 ) the cognitive and referential relationships that comprise content organisation, I (2)
cohesion relationships, ""which relate what is being said at the moment to what has been
said"" (p. l 1 2), and (3) staging relationships, ""which indicate the speaker' s perspective on
what is being said"" (p. l l 3).
In Chapter 1 0, the focus was on the content organisation, in particular the organisational
strategies (chaining and thematic), the discourse rules and the information packaging used
in five types of Korafe discourses. In this chapter, we will examine cohesion and staging
relationships in Korafe narratives.
Cohesion has to do with the establishment of links between units expressing significant
information in the discourse, such as themes, referents, and events. Cohesion is
progressively established by devices that maintain continuity . Section 1 1 . 1 outlines some
significant signals of continuity and discontinuity in Korafe narrative discourses.
In constructing discourse, speakers commonly have in mind one or more of the
following questions: Who ' s important? Who' s in charge? What happened? When did it
happen? Where did it happen? Who did it? Why did it happen? Who will correct it? In
formulating discourse, they do more than keep track of participants, the actions they
perform, and the states they find themselves in. They impose their perspective on the
account, assigning relative prominence to participants and topics and making other thematic
or staging decisions. Section 1 1 .2 examines several of the devices used to register the
relative level of centrality and control attributed to each participant.
The discussion in this chapter is drawn from a corpus of over 50 narrative texts.","[399, 400]"

"17The term 'sentence' is not easily defined. Three types differentiated by Lyons ( 1 977:622-635) are:
system-sentences, text-sentences, and utterance-units. System-sentences can be generated from the
formal grammatical rules without reference to any deictic or endophoric context. Text-sentences are
""context-dependent utterance-signals (or parts of utterance-signals)"" (Lyons 1 977:622). Utterance-units
are a subset of utterances which Harris ( 1 95 1 : 1 4) defines as ""any stretch of talk by one person, before
and after which there is silence on the part of that person"". Simple utterance units ""contain one and only
one simple proposition"" and ""are the basic units of language behaviour"" (Lyons 1 977:633).
The term ' simple sentences' used here approximates the abstract grammatical construct termed
' system-sentences', allowing, as Lyons ( I 977:626) suggests, that at least some part of their prosodic
structure, including their intonation contour, be accounted for. Declarative, interrogative and imperative
sentences are system-sentences with a particular grammatical structure. When system-sentences are
contextualised by language speakers, they can be regarded as ""utterance-un its-to which such terms as
' statement', 'question', and 'command' are applicable ( 1 977:633).""",[159]

"2.3.2 PERSON AND NUMBER OF SUBJECT
Five persons are distinguished in Korafe finite verb forms: first, second and third person
singular, first and third person plural conflated, and second person plural. Table 2.4 shows
the five person indexes and their occurrence in some suffix sets.

appears to be a unit, apocopating in third person singular forms predicating content
questions and occurring terminally in third person dependent final forms for near past and
yesterday'S past tenses ?O2.3.3 SPEECH-ACT VALUE
The final partial in the suffix set expresses the speech-act value the speaker assigns to
the sentence. Korafe speakers use four speech-act value markers : -a, -i, -e and -0.
The -e and -0 appear to be deictic spatio-temporal and psychological orienters, related to
the demonstratives e 'this' and 0 'that, far off. As Table 2.3 illustrates, the -e is the speech20The -ra occurs in complementary distribution with -a as allomorphs of the speech-act value partial { -a} .
The -ra occurs with third person singular independent indicative and dependent final forms; the -a with
non-third person independent indicative non-past final forms and dependent final forms.
The -ra could also be related to the copula ri, -ra indicating neutrality with regard to assertion and ri the
speaker's commitment to the factuality of the marked clause.",[58]

"The medial verb form edo 'do' is used as a coordinating conjunction by Korafe speakers
to link paragraphs and sentences and occasionally clauses and NPs. The speaker uses it to
signal the importance of either the temporal order: 'and then' or the logical order: ' and in
addition to that, on top of that' . In the following example, the speaker uses edo to express
how negative the situation really was.

[li]In Farr and Farr ( 1 974:8-9), nasal consonants (both nasals and prenasalised p losives) were said to
condition nasalised vowels, which were viewed as allophones of oral vowels. Neutralisation of contrast
between voiced plosives and voiced pre-nasalised plosives was said to occur following a syllable with a
nasal onset and a processually nasalised vowel.
However, non-processually nasalised vowels also occur in quite a number of Korafe words. Therefore,
the question now is: are all pre-nasalised plosives the result of contact assimilation of voiced plosives
with preceding nasalised vowels? The following synchronic evidence does not support a phonemic series
of pre-nasalised plosives in Korafe.
( I ) When some words are partially reduplicated, the reduplicated syllable i s not prenasalised. Thus, for
embo 'person' , the resultant form is embobo 'people', not *embomb o. Likewise, partial
reduplication of imboti ' mother-in-law' results in imboboti ' mothers-in-law'.
(2) Evidence from word-play games for the most part supports a nasalised vowel rather than pre­
nasalised p losives. The word jingabu 'snake' is scrambled as b ugajin; sumbira ' he ran' is
scrambled as birasum.
(3 ) Unlike other languages in the Binandere family Korafe does not have word-initial pre-nasalised
plosives:
Mado Baruga [ m bu) ' get' (Korafe [bu)),
Mado Baruga [ndi) 'bird' (Korafe [ci:l.k ha)), and
Ewage [Ilga) ' canoe' (Korafe [ya.k haD.
Thus, nasalised vowels occur unambiguously in the corpus, and pre-nasalised plosives do not. This alters
the analysis, but does not affect the orthography.
Nasalised vowels are written as vowel + n before 'd', 'g ', 'j ', 'gh ' and at word breaks and as vowel + m
before 'b '.
The Korafe word for 'and' is written as ii, a compromise that accommodates both those speakers who do
pronounce it as nasalised and those who do not.","[32, 33]"

The use of the imperfective { ere-} is obligatory with the following verb stems: ( 1 ) all
verbs that have the same root before the class vowel or characteristic vowel is added and
(2) all u-verbs that manifest the stem I 'mb ' � stem II 'j' shift. Thus, the near past form for
se/si ' say' must be resani; sani is ungrammatical. U-verbs such as gembulgefu ' write' must
have eregefani as their near past form, gefani is ungrammatical. With verbs that have
reduplicated, suppletive, or otherwise modified stem I I forms, the occurrence of the
imperfective { ere- } with the near past tense depends on the speaker' s interpretation of the
duration of the event. Therefore, both forms of the following occur: eregosani/gosani ' I
saw', tenduderani/tendudani ' I lashed' , ererurani/rurani 'I got' and eredorani/dorani ' I
hit' . The following paradigms are independent forms, also used as predicates o f content

before today and yesterday' s past for events before that time.)

"12According to Longacre (1 972:68-69, 90-9 1), ""natural languages contain in their lexical structure certain
Expectancy Chains. An Expectancy Chain may involve (i) a succession of actions which customarily
follow each other in chronological order; (ii) an intent to act plus the action itself; (iii) an obligation to
act plus the action; or (iv) the ability to act plus the action ... around the world, we find Expectancy
Chains which involve successive actions such as: 'leave (someplace). .. go. . . arrive '; 'search. . .find';
'waste away. . . die '; fall down. . . smash. ...
Expectancy Chains which involve Succession with different actors are such as the following:
'shoot... die '; 'hit.. . die '; 'call... answer... '; 'give (to someone) ... appreciate '; give (to someone) ... cook (it) '.
Although most of his examples are paired collocations, Longacre does not clearly differentiate paired
clause sequences from scripts. (See discussion of scripts in Chapter 1 0.) And two of his multimembered
expectancy chains definitely correspond more closely to scripts: 'go with hooks... tie hooks. . . catch
fish. . . bringfish. .. eat ' and 'cook in leaves.. .put into container... bring to the canoe... come down '.
The standardised clause sequences described in this chapter, for the most part, contain two verbs.
They are lexically, grammatically, and phonologically constrained. Korafe scripts often involve more
than two verbs. Although the verbs in Korafe scripts are lexically constrained, the definition of scripts
does not involve grammatical or phonological constraints.
