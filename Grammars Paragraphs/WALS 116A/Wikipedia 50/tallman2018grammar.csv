664TXT 105:087The verb ak ‘do’ in combination with the negative morpheme yáma ‘not’ is used as
a negative response to a polar question, as illustrated in (8.96). In the affirmative, the
expletive haa ‘yes’ is used, however (Section 4.2.2 on interrogatives).","[707, 708]"
"2334.2.2.3. Other functions of the interrogativeIn Chácobo, interrogative clause-types have a number of related functions apart from
asking for information. As noted in Erikson (2010), questions are used as a form of greeting
and for other social conventions in Chácobo (and Matis). Such expressions diverge from
the prototypical use of an interrogative as inquiring about information because the answer
to the question is always obvious from context. For instance, (4.101) is typically uttered
when someone is done eating and it is obvious. The sentence in (4.102) is always uttered
as a greeting at the beginning of the day. The sentence in (4.103) is uttered when the
speaker can clearly see that her interlocutor has arrived.","[276, 277]"

095:101-103Another frequent case where experiential readings are found are in responses to
some of the the interviews that were conducted with Chácobo speakers to try to elicit
personal narratives (see Section 1.8.4 on dynamic interviews). One of the questions is
“Have you ever seen an anaconda?”; an example of this question and its corresponding
answer are provided in (9.26) below. Paë Yaquë is conducting an interview with Bosi
Peralta in Cachuelita. I ask Paë to ask Bosi whether she has ever seen an anaconda. Paë
747relays the experiential perfect question to Bosi producing a {A,S}-C construction. Bosi
correspondingly responds with an {A,S}-C construction. Both of these sentences illustrate
that {A,S}-constructions are used for experiential perfects.","[790, 791]"
"4.2.2 Interrogatives
4.2.2.1. Interrogatives - IntroductionAn interrogative refers to a grammatical structure which encodes typically that a speaker
is requesting information from a hearer (Sadock & Zwicky 1985: 178). In Chácobo, the
interrogative clause-type has a number of other functions apart from requesting
information, such as exhortation, greetings and expressions of regret. Typologically, two
types of interrogative constructions are typically recognized; polar and constituent
interrogatives. Polar interrogatives elicit a yes or no answer and constituent interrogatives
question some particular part of a sentence (König & Siemund 2007: 291). There is a
structural distinction between polar and constituent interrogatives in Chácobo. Crossclassifying the distinction between polar and constituent interrogatives is the distinction
223between interrogative verbal predicate and interrogative non-verbal predicate
constructions.
First, I illustrate the distinction between interrogative marking in verbal and nonverbal predicate constructions with the examples in (4.81) and (4.82). As stated above, in
non-verbal predicate constructions, interrogative clauses are marked with the morpheme ní
which occurs between the predicate phrase and the subject as in (4.81). In verbal-predicate
constructions, interrogativity is coded in the clause-type/rank morpheme. This is illustrated
in (4.82). Interrogative clauses are never marked through intonation to my knowledge.","[266, 267]"

TXT 058:202
1045The most typical function of the epistemic kará in the context of noun phrases is to
indicate that the referent has some property associated with it unknown to the speaker
(“some type of X…”). It is difficult to render such sentences with a “literal” translation in
Spanish or English. The Chácobo typically translate them as questions in Spanish (que
clase de, que será …), although they are not structurally interrogatives and they do not have
the illocutionary function of a question. Examples of this function is provided in (13.68),
(13.69), (13.70), and (13.71).","[1088, 1089]"

example of a grammatical sentence where all of these morphemes occur appears in (3.5).","[157, 158]"
"1.8.4 Dynamic interviews
Dynamic interviews involve two or more participants where one participant asks questions
related to common Chácobo cultural activities (when was the last time you went fishing?
what did you catch?), questions that are meant to elicit narratives at different temporal
distances from the speech time (what were you doing about a month ago? What were you
25doing two weeks ago? What do you plan to do tomorrow/in a week?), and questions that
are meant to elicit speaker perspectives (recount a story that you heard that you don't
believe is true and explain why? Have you ever seen a ghost? How did you know it was a
ghost?). Some of the questions were about stories that had already been relayed to my
interviewing consultants earlier. The interviewing consultants were instructed to attempt
to maintain a dialogue with the other speakers in order to record more conversational
speech. Ostensibly the purpose of recording discourse at distinct temporal distances was to
better understand how tense, aspect, temporal adverbials, and temporal distance
morphemes (or “graded tense” morphemes) were encoded, and their relationship to
perspectival meanings such as reported evidentials and assertive modals. This was
important because the corpus developed from the first year of fieldwork was biased towards
traditional folk stories, which are always in the remote past. The aforementioned interviews
were designed to gather more data about the use of temporal distance morphemes in the
distant and recent past times, and the crasternal (“tomorrow”) and remote future times.
While such interviews were meant to capture more interactional speech, it should be noted
that it is difficult to separate interactional speech registers and monologues at all in my
corpus. The reason is that even in oral histories and folk stories, where one might expect
longer uninterrupted monologues, the Chácobo consistently engage in conversation
throughout, asking clarifying questions to the main speaker, and sometimes stopping to
discuss interpretation of a story in the case of folk stories.","[68, 69]"

occuring beside this morpheme to provide evidence that =ní wa sa nominalizer itself, I do
not apply this analysis to the remote future =ʂɨ́ because clauses marked with =ʂɨ́ cannot
function as arguments of verbs and cannot be referential without another nominalizer.
However, the topic requires more research.
Recall that the remote past =ní also disallows clause-type rank morphemes
(position 14 in the sentence) in interrogatives. This is not true of =ʂɨ́, which occurs with
interrogative clause-type/rank enclitics in interrogative constructions. An example of =ʂɨ́
occuring in a question comes from one of Miguel Chavez's explanations of his interview
question to a speaker of Siete Almendros (Benicito River). The remote future =ʂɨ́ is used
in a rhetorical question that Miguel asks to himself while trying to induce the other speakers
to discuss their future plans, dreams and desires in (10.38).","[860, 861]"
"(10.7)hisaadanmipaʔɨ=nílookAdam2SGget_drunk=INTER:REMP‘Hey Adam, did you get drunk (a while back)?’OBSVIt is possible that in questions, however, lack of knowledge is more important than
temporal remoteness is per se and thus the speakers question could be reflective of the fact
that he did not want to communicate that the knew specifically about the time of the specific
event of me getting drunk that he was asking about (see Cable [2013] on the relationship
between remoteness and lack of knowledge).
Some evidence for this comes from a personal narrative of a speaker who reflects
on her thought process as she was taking care of one of her babies. She reflects that she
doesn't know whether the baby had been fed or not. Interestingly, in this case the remote
past is used in (10.8). Given that the speaker presumably knows that it would be impossible
for her baby to be alive if she hadn't eaten for a year or more, =ní cannot possible have the
774interpretation that some Chácobo speakers normally insist on in elicitation. In this case =ní
seems to encode that the speaker simply lacks knowledge concerning when the event might
have taken place.","[817, 818]"

“I saw it”1101As stated in the introductory paragraphs, the semantic tests were only conducted
with two Chácobo speakers and thus should be regarded as tentative. Future research on
Chácobo might reveal that some of the results of the tests should be reconsidered. Future
research on the semantics of reportatives might reveal that some of the tests are less reliable
than others or should be tossed out completely.
These considerations aside, if we take the results at face value, they challenge a
common assumption in the literature that reportatives are either modal or illocutionary
operators. The results of the tests applied to Chácobo might suggest that the reportative in
Chácobo is intermediary. In a sense the results lend support to Bruil’s (2014), since they
suggest a correlation between morphosyntactic position and semantics.
Another interesting question is whether the reportatives should in fact be regarded
as one morpheme across all of the reportative constructions described above. It is possible
that the meaning differences can be associated with different positions in constructions and
that there is no need to posit distinct reportative morphemes (one a clause-type morpheme
and the other a modal operator). This question requires future research.","[1144, 1145]"

might make one think that because AntiM can delete the high tone exponent of genitive
case such that there is no phonological difference between the genitive construction and
the noun-noun combination. However, this is not true. The phonological realizations of the
genitive and the dependent non-case marked form of kiríko ‘foreigner’ are disjoint. For
the genitive construction, when AntiM does not apply the noun root is realized with an
LLH shape [ˈkì.ɾì.kó] and when AM does not apply the form is realized with an LLL shape
[ˈkì.ɾì.kò]. In contrast, the non-case marked dependent form is realized with an LHL shape
[kì.ɾí.kò].
In both cases discussed above, there are reflexes on the surface of the functional
tones even when AntiM applies, and these perfectly disambiguate between marked and

functional tones.

relevant junctures. One issue that has not been addressed thus far is whether the optional

phonological environments. This question requires future research based on naturalistic

824The example in (10.44) also demonstrates that the remote future =ʂɨ́ does not
display discourse perseverance; it is not repeated redundantly throughout discourse. Yoca
uses the morpheme once in (10.44b), and does not use it in (10.44d). There are no examples
in my corpus where the same speaker repeats =ʂɨ́ redundantly throughout a narrative. There
are a few cases (to be discussed below), where =ʂɨ́ is repeated redundantly in question
answer pairs, but I argue that this does not count as a counter example to the lack of
discourse perseverance.
Related to the idea of known time in the future, =ʂɨ́ can also be used to express
prediction. An example of a prediction reading is from the folk story of the woman of the
southern wind (yotáno yoʂa). While a number of Chácobo shiver to death in an prolonged
southern freeze brought about by the presence of the southern wind woman, one man
decides to go to his farm plot as indicated in (10.45a); his wife uses =ʂɨ́ predicting his death

The prediction function of the remote future TDM bridges the general distinction between
the temporal distance and modal semantics. A straightforward extension of the prediction
function can be observed by the fact that =ʂɨ́ is always used for the apodosis clause in a
conditional statement that refers to a possible future event (=kɨa ‘counterfactual’ is used
for the apodosis of conditional statements in the past; Chapter 12). The apodosis function
of =ʂɨ́ is illustrated in (10.46).(10.46) a.náaɨ-kiɨ-aDEM11SG=DAT1SG-ACC 2SGhonipi=nomanCOND=CONCURmitsi

TXT 061:597Extending the modal uses found above, the remote future can also be used to
express a probable event (epistemic modality). An examples is provided in (10.47) below.(10.47) a.tsɨk-ahoomainamanípull_out-TRyesMainaCONJECT‘They pulled it out “tsëca!”, “yes, this must be the Maina!”’

of the context of an imperative sentence. An example of this is provided in (10.48), where
the goddess Ashiná uses the remote future =ʂɨ́ in her directives to the mosquitos she just
created to suck the blood of various animals of the forest.","[867, 868, 869, 870, 871]"

"40 A reasonable question arises as to why the experiential reading (as it is described above) is considered aperfect reading at all. The reason for this is primarily typological in that constructions that encode other
perfect readings cross-linguistically can sometimes also encode an experiential reading (Matthewson 2016).
For Matthewson et al. (2016), therefore, it is an “expected” reading of the perfect. In the context of this
dissertation, one might just as well consider it a reading associated with the “discontinuous past”. Future
research might reveal that this association is more salient cross-linguistically and that, therefore, perhaps it
is innapropriate to consider the experiential reading as a type of perfect reading. The important point for this
description is not whether the experiential reading is a “perfect reading” or not, but rather that this reading
does not arise with C-{A,S} constructions.",[789]
"99Tallman and Elias-Ulloa (2017) compared the third (high tone bearing) syllable to
the first and second toneless syllables and showed that vowel duration (ms) and pitch (Hz)
are strong predictors of high tone versus toneless or low/mid pitch syllables. Statistical
comparison of the first and second syllables of the trisyllabic 00H/LLH forms were
performed. In forms such as panabí ‘asaí’ neither the first nor second syllable are
distinguished according to tone (both syllables are toneless) and, thus, a comparison
between the first and second syllable should reveal the phonetic correlates of stress without
the influence of tone. Statistical tests showed that stress that pitch and intensity are
correlates of stress. In neither case was vowel quality (measured in F1 and F2) found to
make a difference. The results are summarized qualitatively in Table 2.15 below.
Table 2.15. Acoustic correlates of prominence types in Chácobo (results of information
theoretic multilevel comparison)
PitchVowelIntensityDuration
Prominence 1 “tone”✓✓Prominence 2 “stress”✓✓More details on the statistical analysis including comparison with alternative
hypotheses and a discussion of the methodology are found in Tallman & Elias-Ulloa
(2017). There are a few limitations of the production study. The most obvious is that it only
100compared syllables in nouns with the same prosodic shape (00H/LLH). It is possible that
the correlates of the tonal and stress contrast differ according to position in the stem. The
other problem is that unstressed and stressed syllables which both contain high tones were
not yet compared.
Currently in linguistic science there is no agreed upon phonetic criterion or test
for distinguishing stress and tone. Intuitively tone should be distinguished based on pitch
and stress based on some combination of acoustic correlates. To my knowledge, however,
there has been little or practically no attention paid to the statistical relationship between
tone categories and other potential correlates besides pitch. For instance, is it incorrect to
refer to prominence 1 as “tone” (as is done in this thesis) because vowel duration also
plausibly plays a role in marking high tone bearing versus toneless syllables? Since the
multivariate structure of phonological categories has not been investigated in the literature
and plays no part in current “word prosodic typologies” (e.g. Hyman 2006, 2009), there is
currently no way to answer this question. Based on the phonetics it is not clear whether
Chácobo should be regarded as a system that distinguishes two types of stress, two types
of tone, or a mixed tone stress system. In this dissertation I assume that Chácobo can be
described as a mixed tone-stress system, but I emphasize that it is not motivated by the
phonetics of this language.
I refer to the two types of prominence as “tone” and “stress” in this grammar
because of their distributional (phonological) properties. As stated above, stress is
culminative and obligatory in its domain and high tone is neither culminative nor
101obligatory. This choice in terminology is influenced by Hyman (2006, 2009), even though
I depart from him in one important respect. I do not see much point in referring to
prosodic/phonological words in the description of Chácobo. In contrast to how prosodic
systems are described in Hyman’s (2006, 2009) typological work, stress is not a word
prosodic property, because there are no other properties in the prosodic domain of stress
apart from stress itself. I assume that for a category of prosodic word to be motivated in an
individual language morphophonological processes need to cluster around this domain
(Schiering, Bickel and Hildebrandt 2010). The morphophonological domains of Chácobo
are described in more detail in 5.3.4.4.","[142, 143, 144, 145]"

Ergative case can also be assigned in subordinate clauses that contain an
imperfective nominalizer. This is illustrated in (7.44), (7.45) and (7.46). Previous linguists
have associated neutral alignments in Chácobo with an “incompletive aspect” (Valenzuela
& Iggesen [2007: 190-191]; Córdoba, Villar, Valenzuela [2012:46]). To the extent that
incompletive is a type of imperfective aspect, the examples below are important for

tense, aspect, clause-typeBefore describing the part-of-speech classes in Chácobo, a terminological
clarification is in order. There are some roots that can function in more than one class at a
time. For instance, the root íbo ‘owner (n.), to own (v.)’ in Chácobo can function as a noun
or a verb, where it refers to an ‘owner (n.)’ or a transitive predicate ‘to own something (v.)’
respectively. There are two ways of describing such a situation. One way is by referring to
a process called zero-derivation, that derives one of the part-of-speech categories from the
132others. For instance, one could consider the noun function of ibo ‘owner’ to constitute its
underlying meaning. The verb function ‘to own something’ could be derived from the noun
through zero-derivation. Another way of describing such cases is by positing that such a
root is lexically flexible between verb and noun classes. In this grammar, I use the
terminology of lexical flexibility to describe such cases. The reason is that I see this concept
as capturing distinct degrees of autonomy that different part-of-speech classes exhibit visà-vis other part of speech classes. For instance, adverbs are a much less robust grammatical
class because, overall, they display a high degree of lexical flexibility with a number of
different part-of-speech classes. This terminological choice should not be seen as a
theoretical decision, however. I am not claiming that an analysis that posits zero-derivation
or perhaps differentiates it in some way from lexical flexibility is incompatible with the
data in Chácobo (see the papers in Rijkhoff and van Lier [2013] on this question).","[174, 175, 176]"

"As is typical of demonstrative noun-combinations cross-linguistically (Matthews
2007; Croft 2001), the criteria of headedness do not clearly point to one or the other element
being the head in the tóa hóni ‘that man’ construct. First, according to the criterion of
endocentricity, neither tóa ‘that’ nor hóni ‘man’ is the head or dependent. Either tóa ‘that’
can be dropped leaving hóni ‘man‘ by itself as a referential expression or hóni can be
110dropped leaving tóa as the sole referential expression. Subcategorization does not discern
between these cases, either; all demonstratives can combine with all noun roots. I will refer
to the relationship between tóa and hóni in examples such as (3.2) as one of co-dependence.
Because constructs vary in terms of how well the criteria of headedness converge, I will
assume that the syntactic relations between elements across constructs in Chácobo vary on
a scale from symmetrical (co-dependent) to asymmetrical (head-dependent) based on the
criteria.
Complexes will be named after the syntactic category (noun, verb, adjective) of
their head (see §3.3 for a definition and justification of syntactic categories). For instance,
I will refer to the combination of the noun honi ‘man’ with the adjective siri ‘old’ as a noun
complex. I will refer to the combination of the verb tsaya ‘see’ with its dependents as a
verb complex. This means that the entire sentence in (3.2) is a verb complex in this
grammar. While all verb complexes are sentences, not all sentences are verb complexes.
For instance non-verbal predicate constructions (see Chapter 4 for the distinction between
verbal and non-verbal predicate constructions) can be sentences without being verb
complexes.
In cases where the relation between the elements of a construct is not asymmetric,
I will refer to the the complex by the name of the open class lexical category in the complex
(a description of lexical classes is provided in Section 3.3 below). For instance, the
combination of tsaya ‘see’ and =kɨ ‘declarative, past’ in (3.1) will be referred to as part of
the verb complex, because tsaya ‘see’ is a member of an open class of lexical verb roots
111and =kɨ ‘declarative, past tense’ is not. In (3.2), the combination of toa ‘that’ and honi
‘man’ will be referred to as a noun complex. The reason for this is that honi ‘man’ is a
member of an open class of lexical noun roots while toa is not part of an open lexical class
of morphemes. The principle that a complex is named after the open class lexical root is a
rhetorical convention. The reader should not attach any theoretical or descriptive
significance to this terminological move. For instance, I could call toa honi ‘that man’ a
demonstrative (or determiner) complex and it would not affect the structural analysis of
noun/determiner/demonstrative complexes provided in this grammar3.2. MORPHOTACTIC VARIABLESThis section is concerned with how the syntagmatic organization of morphemes, constructs
and complexes are described in this grammar. By syntagmatic organization, I refer to the
order of elements in a sequence and to their relative contiguity. Contiguity refers to the
degree to which two or more elements must occur together or conversely the degree to
which to or more elements can be separated by other elements (Croft 2001).
The study of the syntagmatic organization of elements in a grammar can be divided
into morphotactics and syntax. The distinction between morphotactics and syntax is usually
described as follows. Morphotactics refers to the distribution and organization of
morphemes in a word. Syntax refers to the distribution and organization of words in a
sentence (e.g. Hockett 1956; Anderson 2015a). The distinction is motivated as long as one
112can discover general organizational principles that distinguish morphotactics from
syntax.10 Otherwise the distinction amounts to an orthographic convention and should have
no place in a descriptive grammar.
At the same time, it is commonly implied or more simply stated, that there is a
continuum between morphotactics and syntax (e.g. Meira 1999: 122; Fleck 2003: 227;
Valle 2017: 241). A similar claim that seems to express the same basic idea is that the
precise division between morphological combination (suffixes) and syntactic combination
(clitics, particles, words) is arbitrary (e.g. Epps 2008: 125), even if there are general
architectural differences between the structure of words and phrases.
In this grammar I assume that the question of whether a language has two systems
of syntagmatic organization (even if they overlap or display fuzziness at their boundaries)
is an empirical question that should be assessed for each language (Haspelmath 2011;
Tallman & Epps forthcoming). I, therefore, take it as the null hypothesis that any
architectural division between morphotactics and syntax in a language is arbitrary, unless
the distinction can be motivated empirically.
It is against this background that I define the terms morphotactics and syntax as
opposing ends of a continuum of bondedness rather than terms that identify different10 An example of such an organizational principle comes from Quechua. In Quechua, in syntax the language
has an subject-object-verb order. Inside the verbal word, the order it verb-object-subject, where the object
and subject are expressed by suffixes. Thus, the order of the expression of grammatical relations is reversed
(Weber 1980).","[153, 154, 155, 156]"
"‘Yes, the jaguar was crying (trailing behind) where my daughter came.’
TXT 105:008Note that even when an apocopable morpheme occurs after the clause-type/rank
position, apocope is not blocked without caveats. In order for apocope to be blocked the
noun or adjective needs to be on the right edge of the noun phrase in position 16. This is
illustrated with in (6.140) and (6.141) below. In both cases the noun root kamáno~kamá
490‘jaguar’ follows a clause-type/rank morpheme and in both cases the apocoped form
surfaces. These examples illustrate that the apocope is only blocked in position 16 when
the relevant noun or adjective is the right-most element in the noun phrase.","[533, 534]"

future research. In certain contexts speakers judge that the addition of =bɨki adds no
semantics to a verb stem that already contains the interactional -na. For instance, my
consultants judged the following sentences the same for a description of two people that
mutually exchange each other‘s glasses.(8.158) a.bɨroatʃ-a=ma=tírari-na=ká(n)=kiglassesgrab-TR=CAUS=PURPchange-ITRCT2=PL=DEC:NONP‘They exchanged their glasses.’706b.bɨroatʃ-a=ma=tírari-na=bɨki=ká(n)=kiglassesgrab-TR=CAUS=PURPchange-ITRCT2=ITRCT1=PL=DEC:NONP‘They exchanged their glasses.’ELICThe same is true of another situation where participants are all laughing
simultaneously with one another. Expression with -bɨki or -nabɨki is considered equivalent.
My consultants found certain cases with only -na to be semantically odd however. In this
case, I suspect it is because it is difficult to conceptualize laughter being a competitive type
of interaction. However, this would not explain why speakers regard (8.158a) and (8.158b)
as equivalent descriptions.(8.159) a.tʃani-na=ʔitsitsiri=bɨki=ká(n)=kispeak-ITRCT=CONCUR:SP5laugh=ITRCT1=3PL=DEC:NONP‘As they spoke they were laughing between each other.’

strategies for expressing reciprocal situations. They are not the only strategies, however.
Other expressions in Chácobo can also express reciprocal situations; for instance, hato
