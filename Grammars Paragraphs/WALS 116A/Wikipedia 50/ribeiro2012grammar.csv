‘If anyone was left, do call out to us!’8.11 Negation
62There is one basic negative morpheme in Karajá, -ko); suffixed to the verb, it negates
the entire sentence (73). It can also occur with the pro-form ♀ ado) ‘thing’ (♂ao)), forming a
negative particle which negates individual constituents of the sentence (74) and also occurs
in answers to yes/no questions (75b). The negative morpheme, followed by the imperfective
clitic, can also be used in such circumstances (75c). An emphatic morpheme, hÈkÈ (♂hÈkÈ),
occurs with ado)ko) or a verb to convey a strong negation (75d).","[73, 74]"

There are two basic interrogative morphemes in Karajá, èbo and èwE; both seem to
be used interchangeably, though èbo tends to be more common. They combine with the proforms ♂ado) (♂ao)) ‘thing’, bo) ‘human’, and ÎI ‘circumstance (time, place, manner)’ to form
interrogative words (76-78). Notice that entire phrases (76d, 78d), referring to the focus of
the question, can be situated between the pro-form and the interrogative clitic.

"5.1 ‘Semantic types’As the examples above illustrate, concepts expressed as adjectives in other languages
can be lexicalized either as nouns or as change-of-state verbs in Karajá. The assignment of a
given concept to one or another part of speech seems to be semantically fairly consistent.
Opposite pairs (‘antonyms’) generally fall into the same part of speech, what is probably
related to the fact pointed out by Dixon (1977, 27) that “each semantic type has basic or
‘norm’ connection with a single part of speech.” Thus, while ÎOÎ´kE ‘to become hot’ anduÎǨÎǨ ‘to become cold’ are both verbs, -UrU ‘darkness’ and -uSa ‘clearness’ are both nouns.
Similarly, all basic-color concepts are basically lexicalized as verbs (TO ‘to be made red’,218kura ‘to be made white’, l´bÈ ‘to be made black’). The distribution of the different semantic
types between nouns and verbs constitutes an interesting question to be investigated in the
future.","[229, 230]"
"6.2 PalatalizationConsidering the reanalysis of the vocalic inventory proposed here, it is possible to
question the phonemic character of the complete series of palatals, /tS, dZ, and S/. A careful
examination of the distribution of palatal consonants in Karajá reveals that they occur in very
restricted environments—generally in contiguity to high [+ATR] vowels. Thus, as the
examples below show, the interdental fricative and the palatal fricative are in complementary
distribution: [S] occurs after the high [+ATR] vowels /u/ and /i/, whereas [T] occurs
elsewhere.
34The Karajá terminology is reminiscent of the distinction between big and thin in Kujamutay (Greenberg &
Sapir 1978).
116(83)bITa
iSa‘macaw’
‘bowl’-kÈTE ‘scratch’
kuSe ‘fish flour’-UTaruSa‘forget’
‘raw’Therefore, the distinction between [+ATR] and [-ATR] high vowels proves to be
crucial also for the analysis of the consonantal system. The allophonic nature of the
variations shown above is missed if the oppositions between /i, È, u/ and /I, È, U/ are not
recognized. It can be reasonably concluded that the interdental fricative and the palatal
fricative are allophones of the same phoneme.
The study of some morphophonemic alternations also corroborates the analysis
suggested above. Thus, the nominalizer suffix -TV (where V stands for a vowel identical to
the last vowel in the verb root) is palatalized when attached to a verb root ending in the high
front [+ATR] vowel /i/, but not after its [-ATR] counterpart /I/:(84)VerbNoun-aha

‘nominal suffix’One of the sources of tS in Southern and Northern Karajá is the palatalization of the
velar stop /k/ after the [high, +ATR] vowel /i/, a process that does not occur in Javaé and
Xambioá (86). Again, the high front [-ATR] vowel /I/ does not trigger palatalization: bIkOwa

Karajá, transitive verbs are always marked by the prefix I-. As I mentioned above, both
transitive and intransitive valence prefixes may fuse with the preceding personal prefix under
certain circumstances, such as in the 2nd person in the centrifugal direction of the realis mood
(55a). Notice that there is no fusion in the centripetal direction (55b).","[62, 63]"
"1698. Concluding remarksThe main purpose of this chapter was to describe the female versus male speech
distinctions in Karajá and to outline some of the questions such a phenomenon may pose to
historical linguistics and sociolinguistics, as well as the implications of such a phenomenon
for the analysis of Karajá phonology and morphology. Although male versus female speech
distinctions are commonly found in the languages of the world, very little is known on how
such distinctions are brought about historically, how they correlate with other social
institutions, and how and why they cease to exist. In this sense, the example of the Karajá
dialects is particularly interesting, for it provides both a situation in which the distinctions are
vigorously preserved and a case in which they seem to have faded away diachronically.
The phenomenon of gender dialects in Karajá illustrates a sui generis case of
language change, whose social and historical motivations constitute a rich theme to be further
explored in future studies. Rather than providing the final word on such a complex and
fascinating topic, I hope the main merit of this chapter is in revealing additional lines of
inquiry. The data suggest that the genesis of such distinctions may be related to an overall
tendency towards voiceless stop lenition, a hypothesis which needs to be further tested as our
comparative knowledge of Macro-Jê improves. There seems to be a strong correlation
between age and the extent to which genderlectal distinctions are carried out by individual
speakers, which begs for additional investigations into how and when such distinctions are
acquired. The possibility of imperfect learning of the peculiarities of each speech within
mixed families—a factor which, as I suggest, may have been at the heart of the weakening of170genderlectal distinctions in Javaé—also deserves further investigation, beyond the anecdotal
(albeit compelling) reports by native speakers. An in-depth investigation into these issues
must be preceded by an accurate description of the data, and it is my hope that this chapter
may represent a substantial contribution towards that goal.","[180, 181, 182]"

6Actually, Fortune & Fortune (1963) described the phonemic contrast between /u/ and /U/ and even represented
both separately in an early version of the Karajá orthography (with the letters <u> and <ù>, respectively; cf.
Fortune & Fortune 1972). However, in their latest version of the Karajá orthography (as in Alford, Fortune &
Fortune 1983), such distinction is no longer represented. As we will see, Fortune & Fortune (1963) briefly
mentioned vowel harmony as a matter of height assimilation, without noticing the opposite behaviors of /u/
(which triggers vowel harmony) and /U/ (which undergoes it), despite both being high vowels. The use of a
grave accent with <ù> parallels its use with the back mid vowels, where <ò> represents the open-mid vowel /O/
and <o> represents the close-mid vowel /o/. The decision to graphically mark the [-ATR] vowels, instead of the
[+ATR] ones, is in itself problematic, since [-ATR] vowels (as the unmarked members of the opposition) are
much more common. That is, the system of diacritics devised to differentiate [-ATR] and [+ATR] vowels is
functionally backwards.

describe four (as in Table 2 above) and Cavalcante (1992) describes three nasal vowels
(treating the nasal low vowel as an allophone of its oral counterpart), while Rodrigues
(1999), in a recent survey of the Macro-Jê languages, states that Karajá “has only two nasal
vowels, /´)/ and /o)/.” The apparently questionable phonemic status of both /¸)/ and /a)/ is due to
their low frequency. But, as it will be further discussed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, their
distribution is not predictable and there is fairly clear evidence of contrast between them and
their oral counterparts. The schwa, whose phonemic status is also problematic, will be
thoroughly discussed in Section 4.2.3.","[97, 98]"
"3.6 Use of female speech by men, and vice-versaExamples in which the k-dropping rule may or may not apply cannot be confused
with cases in which a male speaker deliberately uses female speech forms. In fact, as in
Koasati (Haas 1964) and Yana (Sapir 1949), female and male speakers can use each other’s
speech forms when ‘impersonating’ a character of the opposite sex, such as when narrating a
story or baby-sitting. Thus, if a male speaker is, for example, quoting a female character or
baby-talking to his daughter, he will use plain female speech in doing so.16 Inversely,
women will use male speech forms when quoting a male character or baby-talking to a baby
boy. The use of female speech by a male speaker is further illustrated by the sentence below,16A very interesting question to be investigated is when and how are the distinctions between female and male
speech learned by the child. According to Fortune & Fortune (1975:115), “at about age three, mothers start
insisting in the Karajá tribe that boys use only men’s speech. This is the beginning of the socialization process
which continues until the adult male is admitted to the men’s house where no young initiate would ever use
women’s speech.” However, the observance of the female-male speech differences in baby-talk suggests that
these distinctions start being acquired much earlier.

"Oblique promotion38This example illustrates a very common process for deriving nouns from verb roots, namely consonantal
replacement, which consists in replacing a velar stop or a glottal fricative occurring in the last syllable of the
verb root with an alveolar flap: rika I ‘to walk’ > rira ‘the action of walking’, rira-da) ‘walking place’, rira-dU
‘the one who walks’; TUhO I ‘to wash’ > TUrO ‘the action of washing’, TUrO-da) ‘washing material’, TUrO-dU ‘the
one who washes’ (see Section 4.1). Thus, the transitive stem in (12b) above is constructed with the nominal
form of the verb Uka ‘to be cooked’, Ura ‘the action of cooking’, followed by the verbalizer suffix -d´).
192With a few extended intransitive verbs which take an allative or dative argument,
such as ´)k´)raSi ‘to ask’, transitivization results in the promotion of the former oblique
argument to direct object (examples from the Xambioá dialect):(28)a.hawÈkÈÎarikOrEkO

in (7) above. As mentioned above (Section 2.2), transitive and intransitive valence prefixes

person in the centrifugal direction of the realis mood (29a). Notice that there is no fusion in

"2. The ‘Macro-Jê hypothesis’The Macro-Jê stock comprises the Jê family and a number of possibly related
language families, most of which are located in Brazil (the exception being Chiquitano,
which is also spoken in Bolivia). Macro-Jê is arguably one of the lesser-known language262groups of South America, its very existence as a genetic unit being still ‘‘a working
hypothesis’’ (Rodrigues 1999: 165). According to Rodrigues (1986, 1999), whose
classification has been the most widely accepted among researchers working on Brazilian
languages, the ‘Macro-Jê hypothesis’ comprises 12 different language families: Jê, Kamakã,
Maxakalí, Krenák, Purí, Karirí, Yatê, Karajá, Ofayé, Boróro, Guató, and Rikbaktsa. The
existence of Jê as a language family has been recognized since early classifications of South
American languages (Martius, 1867). ‘Jê’ is a Portuguese spelling for a Northern Jê
collective morpheme ([je] in Apinajé, for instance) that occurs in the names of several Jêspeaking peoples. The term ‘Macro-Jê’ was coined by Mason (1950), replacing earlier labels,
such as ‘Tapuya’ and ‘Tapuya-Je.’
Recent classifications (Rodrigues, 1986; Greenberg, 1987; Kaufman, 1994) differ as
to the precise scope of Macro-Jê, although there is agreement on the inclusion of most of the
families (Table 1). Except for Karirí (included only by Rodrigues), Greenberg
and Kaufman included all the families listed above. In addition, Greenberg included
Chiquitano (also included by Kaufman), Jabutí, and Otí. Given the lack of comprehensive
comparative studies, the Macro-Jê status of some of these families is still an open question.
Although Guató is included in the stock by all of the aforementioned classifications, there is
no convincing evidence for its inclusion. While the evidence presented by Greenberg (1987)
and Rodrigues (1986, 1999) was rather superficial and inconclusive, a recent study by one of
Rodrigues’ students (Martins 2011), purporting to present additional evidence based on a
perusal of the entire corpus available of Guató, fails to provide any convincing new
arguments. On the other hand, recent studies have revealed compelling additional evidence
for the inclusion of Chiquitano and the Jabutí family into the Macro-Jê stock. Thus, based on263such recent developments, my own classification includes all the families included by
Greenberg, except for Guató and Otí, a poorly documented language once spoken in southern
Brazil, whose meager available data do not support its inclusion in the Macro-Jê stock (or
any family, for that matter). Like Rodrigues, I also include the Karirí family, based
especially on particularly-suggestive grammatical evidence (Rodrigues 1992, Ribeiro 2002).","[273, 274, 275]"

bÈBesides the existence of minimal pairs, the phonemic character of the opposition is also
shown by the fact that lax and tense vowels have quite different behaviors in the processes of
vowel harmony and palatalization. As the examples below demonstrate, the high tense
vowels /i/, /È5/, and /u/ and the close-mid vowels /e/, /Ǩ/, and /o/ are dominant28, triggering
vowel harmony, whereas the high lax vowels /I/, /È/, and /U/ do not trigger vowel harmony.
This fact would be difficult to explain through an analysis in terms of the feature [high]. The
fact that some hig
26I am using the terms [+ATR]/[-ATR] and tense/lax more or less interchangeably here. Noske (1995) finds
“the [+ATR] and [-ATR] vowels of Turkana auditorily quite close to the tense and lax vowels of English and
German.” I would say the same at least with respect to the front vowels /i/ and /I/ of Karajá, which sound to me
similar to the vowels in beat and bit, respectively, but, as Noske noted for Turkana, without the length
distinction occurring in the English examples. The mid vowels resemble the ones of Portuguese. An acoustic
analysis of the Karajá vowels is still to be done, though.
27
In fact, Fortune & Fortune (1963) include /U/ as a phoneme in their initial description of Karajá phonology.
However, more recent works, such as Fortune (1973), do not mention it. Although this phoneme was initially
represented in Fortune’s Karajá orthography, it was not used in more recent published works, such as the latest
version of the New Testament (1983) and literacy materials. After I started discussing the distinction between
[-ATR] and [+ATR] vowels with the Karajá speakers, they decided to use of the letter <ù> to represent /U/ (the
same letter initially adopted by the Fortunes).

(1969).

with transitive verbs as simply a marker of 3rd person object. However, this prefix also occurs with antipassive
constructions (54), which do not allow explicit direct objects.

nouns, of different degrees of grammatical possession: there are obligatorily-possessed nouns
(e.g. body-part terms, for instance), optionally-possessed nouns (e.g cultural items), and
nouns which cannot be directly possessed (e.g. items of nature, such as rocks, water, animals,
etc.). That is a well-documented phenomenon in several Macro-Jê languages, including
those of the Boróro, Jê, and Karirí families (Rodrigues 1999:190-192). In the latter case (that
is, items which cannot be directly possessed), generic nouns such as the ones described above
are used as possessive classifiers in indirect possessive constructions, such as 43 below, from
Boróro (Crowell 1977:178). In Karajá, however, that is not the case, as any noun can in
principle be directly possessed (wa-idZOrOTa ‘my dog’, etc.).","[54, 55, 56]"

‘four Xavánte spirits’spirit9. Table of contentsAs I intended to show in this introduction, many aspects of Karajá phonology,
morphology, and syntax (as well as its peculiar system of gender deixis) remain to be
thoroughly understood. However, even a succinct overview of the language reveals a
number of phenomena rich in theoretical and descriptive implications. It is my hope that this
dissertation will provide us with a better understanding not only of the Karajá language, but
also of the general analytical questions its study raises. The following chapters provide an in
depth description of phenomena which are central to the understanding of Karajá.
Chapter 1 provides a thorough account of the language’s phonological inventory,
syllable and stress patterns, and morphophonology. A major difference between the account
given here and those offered in previous sources lies in the vocalic inventory: here it is
shown that the feature [ATR] ‘advanced tongue root’ plays a central role in Karajá
phonology, as evidenced by a pervasive process of vowel harmony--the first of this kind ever
described for a South American language. [ATR]-ness is also relevant in describing the
second-most common morphophonemic process in the language, palatalization.
Reduplication, maybe the most phonologically-oriented of all word-formation processes, will
also be treated in this chapter.
Chapter 2 deals with an oft-mentioned—yet poorly understood—peculiarity of
Karajá: the existence of systematic differences between male and female speech. As
suggested early on by Ehrenreich (1894), female speech is more conservative, male speech69being generally characterized by the deletion of the velar stop /k/. However, although such
‘genderlectal’ differences are often described as being the result of regular phonological
processes, they can have morphological consequences as well—a fact that went unnoticed in
previous descriptions. The chapter also includes an account of male vs. female speech
distinctions in Javaé, where genderlectal variation is much less prominent (Javaé women
speaking what seems to be a relaxed version of the male speech in the other dialects). A
possible explanation for such a situation, based on a well-documented case of language
contact involving the Javaé, is proposed. Hypotheses on the possible diachronic origins of the
male vs. female speech distinctions are also discussed. Contrary to previous suggestions,
according to which they would be contact-induced (Rodrigues 1999, 2004), the facts seem to
favor an explanation in terms of the language’s own internal historical tendencies.
Chapter 3 describes the language’s word-formation strategies, including, in addition
to morphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles and
clitics. Verb morphology is where most of Karajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verb
inflects for person (with portmanteau morphemes which also indicate mood), direction
(which also play evidential functions), and voice (transitive, passive, and antipassive),
besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns (sometimes with classificatory purposes).
Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics and particles, respectively. As in many other
lowland South American languages, nouns, postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs share
person-marking paradigms. Comparative evidence plays an important role in explaining
less-than-transparent morphological devices, such as linking prefixes (which, as it turns out,
are cognates with similar prefixes in other Macro-Jê languages), synchronically invariable
roots with fossilized prefixes, and a non-concatenative mechanism to derive nouns from70verbs. The latter constitute an unusual case of replacive infixation, which, thanks to
comparative evidence, can be traced back to the affixation of a nominalizing suffix.
Chapter 4 deals with complex sentences. Subordinate clauses in Karajá are always the
result of sentential nominalizations, not only in the cases of relative and complement clauses,
but of adverbial clauses as well. It is here claimed that adverbs in Karajá do not exist as an
independent part-of-speech (or, at least, constitute a marginal part-of-speech with very few
members), adverbial functions being played by postpositional phrases. Consequently,
adverbial clauses are postpositional clauses, marked by the same postpositions which mark
nouns. Their use as subordination markers mirrors their use with nouns, even in the case of
converbs—by far, the most common type of subordinate clauses--, which are marked by a
locative postposition. Considering the role they play with adverbial clauses, postpositions are
described in this chapter. A case of discourse (rather than grammatical) subordination, the
=dokuri clause, will also be described in this chapter.
The last chapter, Chapter 5, provides an appraisal of the evidence for the inclusion of
Karajá in the Macro-Jê stock, taking into consideration additional evidence uncovered by the
present study, informed by recent improvements in the reconstruction of Proto-Jê (Ribeiro
2005). Although a relationship between Karajá and the Jê family had been suggested early
by von den Steinen (1884), Karajá was one of the last languages to be included in the MacroJê stock (Davis 1968). As its late inclusion in the stock suggests, the similarities between
Karajá and other Macro-Jê languages are far from obvious. The evidence presented by Davis,
however, is being further corroborated by additional data, as this chapter hopefully
demonstrates. Especially compelling for the hypothesis of genetic relationship are those
instances in which comparative evidence helps explain synchronic irregularities of Karajá, as71in the case of the replacive infix. The chapter demonstrates the interplay between descriptive
and historical linguistics: on the one hand, it shows how a better descriptive knowledge of a
language may contribute to uncover additional pieces of comparative evidence; on the other,
it shows how a better comparative knowledge may contribute to improve our understanding
of synchronic phenomena.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"
"165historical drift towards voiceless stop lenition in Karajá which could be at the root of the kdropping rule which characterizes male speech.
At any rate, although the regularity of phonological processes remains a major tenet
of historical linguistics, there are well-documented cases in which semantic or functional
factors may interfere with such regularity. A rather illustrative example is provided by
Goddard (1991:60), in discussing Cheyenne vis-à-vis Proto-Algonquian:“Cheyenne […] shows one intriguing development that is not yet explained:
*p and *k are both dropped, but only, it would seem, optionally; where
doublets can be compared, the form with retention has a diminutive meaning
beside the form with loss […]. Such doublets appear to point to the negative
semantic conditioning of a sound law, surely not a very common type of
sound change.”
Likewise, the preservation of /k/ in Karajá female speech could be seen as the result
of a negative sociolinguistic conditioning of a sound law—again, “not a very common type
of sound change”. The synchronic variations in the degree to which k-deletion takes place,
coupled with its productive application even to recent loanwords, are in themselves very
enlightening, demonstrating how a phonological rule gains a life of its own once it is invested
with a sociolinguistic function.","[176, 177]"

dialectal differences such as the ones illustrated above, their decision concerning Karajá orthography suggests
that they consider Javaé and Xambioá to be more conservative. The schwa is not represented in the common
orthography adopted for the four dialects. Thus, morphemes such as Î´ka ‘to tie’ and Îaka ‘to take off’ (a
minimal pair in Karajá, but a homophonous pair in Xambioá) are not distinguished orthographically in any of

However, the fact that the schwa occurs only in unstressed positions makes its
phonemic status problematic. Furthermore, there is plenty of independent evidence
demonstrating that Karajá proper presents, indeed, a tendency towards dissimilation. I will
argue that such tendency is actually inherited from Proto-Karajá (and, therefore, that the
Xambioá and Javaé dialects have innovated). The following sections discuss arguments
against and in favor of considering the schwa as a conservative feature. Based on
morphophonemic data, as well as on comparative evidence and the behavior of loanwords,
Section 5.2.3.1 describes a strong tendency towards dissimilation in Karajá proper, a
phenomenon which is at the root of the origin of the schwa. Section 4.2.3.2 shows that, on
the other hand, deviations in the general correspondence rules set above (e.g. b´dI :: bIdI
‘honey’), as well as the existence of multiple reflexes, in Javaé and Xambioá, of a single
morpheme in Karajá, strongly suggest that there was indeed a schwa in Proto-Karajá.
Considerations of predictability are especially important in considering the schwa as a
conservative feature: while it is possible to predict the shape of a morpheme in Xambioá and
Javaé from their shape in Karajá, the opposite is not true.","[104, 105]"

Since, as will be shown, processes of syllabic rearrangement played a crucial role in
the development of consonantal replacement in Karajá, a brief description of the syllabic
patterns of both Proto-Jê and Karajá is also necessary. In Macro-Jê, syllabic patterns are
rather simple. As summarized by Rodrigues (1999), clusters “are limited to the combination
of grave (labial and velar) stops followed by a central or a lateral approximant.” This state of
affairs can be reconstructed for Proto-Jê, and is maintained in most Jê languages. Karajá also
presents the same type of clusters (cf. krO ‘toad’, brO ‘back’). However, as shown by a
35As we have seen in Chapter 2, the series of palatal consonants in Karajá is an innovation (resulting from
palatalization of velar, alveolar, and dental consonants around [high, +ATR] vowels). Their status as phonemes
is still questionable.
279comparison with Proto-Jê (and other better-known Macro-Jê languages such as Maxakalí),
old clusters with an initial voiceless stop were systematically simplified in Karajá (Table 8),
losing the initial stop. The process of cluster simplification seems to have affected only
voiceless stops (voiced stops were preserved, as illustrated by likely cognate pairs such as
Proto-Jê *mrOk ‘ash’, Karajá brÈbÈ). Clusters with an initial voiceless stop were later
reintroduced in Karajá through a process of syncope (*k´rO > krO ‘frog’).36Table 6.8. Cluster simplification in Pre-Proto-Karajá

although a few gaps remain. 37 However, for the purposes of the present study, the facts are
clear. Concerning the inventory, the crucial facts are those related to the aforementioned
generalizations about consonant clusters: (a) Karajá /k/, the only voiceless stop in this
language, corresponds to Proto-Jê *k (Proto-Jê *ko ‘wood, horn’ :: Karajá kO; Proto-Jê *ku
‘to eat’:: Karajá kÈ; also ex. 12 and 13); (b) the voiced stop /b/ in Karajá corresponds to
Proto-Jê *m (Proto-Jê *ma ‘liver’ :: Karajá ba; Proto-Jê *ma) ‘dative’, Karajá b´); also ex. 1436Such syllables can still be considered as underlyingly dissyllabic (/k´.rO/), as demonstrated by their behavior
in processes such as reduplication (which, in Karajá, is sensitive to the number of moras).
37
For instance, correspondences involving Proto-Jê *N are still unclear. The two likely cognates involving
Proto-Jê *N we have so far happen to be a homophonous pair: Proto-Jê *NrE ‘egg’ :: Karajá TI; Proto-Jê *NrE ‘to
dance, sing’ :: Karajá U-TI ‘to dance’. Here, Karajá /T/ corresponds to Proto-Jê *Nr, and not only *r, contrary to
what Davis suggests (again, Proto-Jê *r corresponds to /r/ in Karajá: Proto-Jê *rE ‘to leave behind’ :: Karajá rI).
So, both *kr and *Nr are reflected in Karajá as /T/. This suggests that both *k and *N merged as /k/ in Karajá,
although the data do not allow a definite answer at this time, since no clear examples illustrating
correspondences with *N in other positions have been identified so far.
280and 15); (c) Proto-Jê *r corresponds to Karajá /r/ (Proto-Jê *rE ‘to leave behind’ :: Karajá rI;
also ex. 10-13 and 19).
Unlike Karajá, Jê languages allow consonant-final syllables (cf. Proto-Jê *pek ‘fart’,
*t´t ‘hard’, *par ‘foot’, *pra)m ‘hunger’, etc.). Corresponding to a CVC sequence in Jê,
Karajá has two syllables, the cognate vowel showing up at the last one (C´CV). This
apparent change in the position of the vowel is here termed “pseudo metathesis”—“pseudo”
because, as will be shown, the vowel did not change its position at all. The key to this
process is a rather common phenomenon in Macro-Jê--the insertion of so-called “echo
vowels,” which has been documented in at least three families (Jê, Ofayé, and now Karajá;
see the discussion of the schwa as a likely case of dissimilation, in Chapter 2). Although
languages vary as to the inventory of consonants involved (in Ofayé, it only takes place after
/r/: Far ‘foot’ [""FWara/]; in Kaingáng, only after approximants; in Suyá, after all final
consonants), they have one thing in common: a vowel identical with the one in the last
syllable is inserted after the final consonant. In Karajá, the original vowel was then
weakened to a schwa, a process that finds parallels in other Macro-Jê languages. 38 Notice,
however, that if the final consonant is *r, the original vowel is deleted, the result being a
CCV cluster (ex. 18):38A very similar sucession of processes happened in Xerénte (Central Jê), as shown by a comparison with
Proto-Jê and Xavante (the other surviving Central Jê language):

the consonant replacement pattern shown in Table 1. As the correspondences illustrated
above show, it is rather plausible to consider (on phonological and semantic grounds) the
“replacive infix” –r- in Karajá as a cognate of the Jê nominalizer *-r. Its peculiar distribution
can be accounted for by a succession of independently-demonstrable diachronic processes.
This is illustrated below (Table 10) by the Karajá root kÈ ‘to eat’ (nominal form rÈ), a likely
cognate of Proto-Jê *ku (nominal form *ku-r)Table 6.10. From suffix to “replacive infix”

*kÈrÈ
*k´rÈ
*krÈrÈIf the description provided here is correct, we should be able to find elsewhere
(besides those examples involving suffixation of the nominalizer) additional cases in which
final *r came to be in prevocalic position. That is indeed the case: the Karajá cognate of the
Jê verb root *kÈr ‘to call, to bellow’39 is rÈ, displaying exactly the same correspondences
39In this case, the final /r/ is indeed part of the stem, as suggested by Southern Jê (Xokléng kÈl ‘to shout out, to
cry’; Urban 1985:177), where the nominalizer *-r does not occur (cf. also Maxakalí cat ‘to call’; Pereira
282described above (see also Table 9, ex. 18). Examples such as these show that the infixal
location of the nominalizer is a byproduct of regular phonological processes which affected
*r-final stems in general.
Also, if consonant clusters involving voiced stops were indeed preserved in Karajá,
one should be able to find cases in which the nominalizer has been preserved after /b/. That,
in fact, also happens: the nominal form corresponding to the Karajá verb -bU ‘to cry’ is -brU
(cf. Meb. muw ‘to cry’, nominal form muw-r; also compare example 18 in Table 9). Cases
such as *par ‘foot’ :: Karajá wa, where lenition seems to have prevented the creation of an
environment for cluster formation, provide clues on the relative chronology of the
phonological processes postulated herein (*p-lenition must have preceded cluster
formation).403.4.1 Residual examples: h-replacementThere are a few verb stems for which, instead of /k/, it is /h/ that is replaced by /r/ in
the nominal form (Table 11). Except for hO ‘to wash’, 41 all of these stems present, after the
glottal fricative, a front vowel. Thus, it is possible that such cases represent original
instances in which *k preceded a front vowel. The velar stop would have undergone a1992:95). The final consonant was apparently reinterpreted as a suffix in the other branches of the Jê family,
Central and Northern Jê, where the nominalizer –r is still productive.
40
One should not assume, however, that lenition took place simultaneously for *p and *t. As the survival of *k
demonstrates, different consonants (although belonging to the same “natural class”) may behave differently in
processes such as this (and the same applies to cluster simplification). Lenition of *p and *t and cluster
simplification can both be seen as instances of the same tendency (a Sapirian “drift,” if we will) to weaken
voiceless stops (fully consolidated in pre-consonantal position, but only half-way so in pre-vocalic position).
As for the “preservation” of *k in Karajá, that is only half the story, as we have seen in Chapter 3.
41
Clear correspondences in Jê for Karajá /h/ have not yet been found. /h/ could have derived historically from a
stop (for instance, */); that would provide an explanation for its behavior, in terms of consonantal replacement,
with the stem hO ‘to wash’.
283process of spirantization after the alternation between *k and *r was already in place (e.g.
*kE ‘to scratch’ ~ nominal form *rE > hE ~ rE). In fact, there are no cases of r-infixation
involving the velar stop before a front vowel; thus, it is reasonable to suggest that, in the
small corpus of consonant-replacing verbs, /k/ and /h/ are in complementary distribution
(again, with the exception of hO ‘to wash’). Likely cognates in Jê suggest that this
interpretation is on the right path (cf. Meb -ke ~ -ke≠ ‘to scratch’ :: Karajá hE; Meb. kOkje ~kOkjer ‘to cut with a cutting instrument’ :: Karajá kOhE).

"In principle, an alternative, more abstract explanation for the evolution of the suffix
*-r into an infix in Karajá could also be proposed, similar to the one suggested by Milizia for
the Proto-Indo-European nasal infixation rule (Milizia 2004). Simply put, the suffix *-r
would have undergone metathesis as a strategy to resolve a constraint against syllable-final
consonants (*kÈr > *krÈ). This would provide a more straightforward explanation, eliminating
the need to postulate steps (b), (c), and (d) (Table 10), which could be replaced by one single
rule of metathesis.",[295]
"2. Back to phonology: some dialectal differencesAs we have seen in the previous chapters, the four dialects share essentially the same
phonological inventory, although there are slight differences with respect to the occurrence
of certain phonological processes. In this section, I summarize some of those differences
which will be relevant for the topic of the present chapter.
The main phonological difference consists in the occurrence in Southern and
Northern Karajá of a schwa [´] in unstressed positions, corresponding to environments in
which Xambioá and Javaé present a vowel identical to the one occurring in the following
syllable:(1)KarajáJavaé, Xambioák´dO

r´kUkOdO
bIdI
-d´)k´)
rUkU‘termite’
‘honey’
‘causative suffix’
‘gourd’Another difference is the occurrence, in the Karajá dialects, of surface CCV syllables,
resulting from a process of syncope of a schwa occurring between a stop and the alveolar
approximant /r/. As expected, Xambioá and Javaé present a vowel identical to the vowel in
the following syllable and no epenthesis takes place:129(2)Karajá

bOrO‘frog’
‘martim-pescador (bird sp.)’
‘back’As I have suggested in the previous chapter, there are reasons to believe that Southern
and Northern Karajá are, with respect to the existence of the schwa, the most conservative
dialects. The alternative would be to consider the scenario occurring in Javaé and Xambioá
as the most conservative, postulating for Southern and Northern Karajá a rule of lenition of
an unstressed vowel when followed by a syllable containing an identical vowel. However,
this hypothesis is ruled out by the existence, in Southern and Northern Karajá, of minimal
pairs such as Îaka [Îa""ka] ‘to take off’ versus Î´ka [Î´""ka] ‘to tie’ (corresponding to a
homophonous pair in Xambioá), as well as bOrO [bO""rO] ‘stingray’ versus b´rO [brO] ‘back’
(corresponding to a homophonous pair in both Javaé and Xambioá). As will be seen, the
facts of the male-female speech distinction also argue in favor of the hypothesis that the
schwa can be reconstructed for Proto-Karajá.
Another phonological process that differentiates Javaé and Xambioá from Southern
and Northern Karajá is the palatalization, in the latter, of the velar stop /k/ when following
the [high, front, +ATR] vowel /i/.2 As will be shown, the resulting affricate, [tS], will still
behave as /k/ in relation to the process of k-dropping.

130Xambioá dialects as the prototype. As will be shown later, it is rather reasonable to claim
that Javaé, where most of the distinctions are now obliterated, evolved from a situation
similar to the one still present in the other dialects.3.1 k-droppingEhrenreich’s brief description summarizes the most common differences between
female and male speech in Karajá. The main difference, as he points out, is the absence, in
the male speech, of a velar stop occurring in the corresponding female speech form (kOwOrU
‘tree, wood’, ♂ OwOrU). The deletion of the velar stop can make possible the fusion between
vowels, the result being that the male forms may have a smaller number of syllables (♀ha)lOkOE ‘jaguar’, ♂ ha)lOE), a fact also noticed by Ehrenreich.
The postulation of the female speech as the more conservative one seems to be easily
arguable. The main consideration is predictability: that is, whereas it is generally possible to
predict the male form vis-à-vis the female form, the inverse does not occur. There are
several examples in which sequences of vowels occur both in the female and the male
speech, such as ♀♂ riu ‘hunt’ and ♀♂ UahI ‘medicine’, which makes an alternative rule of kinsertion unlikely. Considerations of predictability are even more evident in cases where
there is vowel fusion: in comparing ♀ bEraku ‘river’ with ♂ bero, it is rather clear that the
latter can be derived from the former, but not vice-versa. Loanwords also provide arguments
for considering the female speech as the less innovative, since borrowings containing a velar131stop will have this consonant systematically suppressed in the male speech: kawarU ‘horse’,
♂ awarU (from Portuguese cavalo); kUbEÎa ‘blanket’, ♂ UbEÎa (Portuguese coberta); b´)ka
‘mango’, ♂ b´)a (Portuguese manga). On the other hand, there is no insertion of a consonant
in loanwords containing sequences of vowels: d¸)eru [nie""ru] ‘money’ (from Portuguese
dinheiro). Morphological considerations also support the postulation of female speech as
more conservative (section 3.2). Finally, in the few cases for which comparative evidence is
available, the velar stop can be shown to be a retention from the proto-language: Proto-Jê *ko
‘wood’ :: kO; Proto-Jê *ku ‘to eat’ :: kÈ.
The fact that female speech is historically more conservative obviously does not
imply that male speech is derived from it. Instead, both gender dialects are probably derived
from a common source, which the female speech happens to represent more faithfully, since
it did not undergo the phonological processes which affected the male speech. Thus,
although female speech forms will coincide with the ones postulated as the historical input
for the male speech forms, this simply reflects the fact that female speech did not undergo
processes such as k-deletion and vowel fusion:Table 3.1. Historical development of the form ‘jaguar’

Output3.1.1. Vowel fusionExamples such as ♀ biku ‘rain’ (♂ biu) and ♀ ba)ki ‘corn’ (♂ ba)i), where the velar
stop is dropped without any further phonological consequences, illustrate the simplest
instance of the processes that differentiate female from male speech. However, there are
several circumstances in which the deletion of the velar stop creates the conditions under
which different vocalic change processes can take place. If the k-dropping rule results in two
identical contiguous vowels, they undergo a process of crasis:4(4)♀ Îaka♂ Îa‘to take off’♀ ha)lOkOE♂ ha)lOE‘jaguar’♀ kOhOkOrE♂ OhOrE‘to cross’♀ ruku♂ ru‘night’♀ aka♂a‘to run’♀ rukuÎǨ♂ ruÎǨ‘to thrust’3In this example, vowel fusion feeds vowel harmony. As we have seen (Chapter 2), the low vowel /a/ blocks
vowel harmony, and that is why the first vowel in ♀ bEraku ‘river’ is not affected by the [+ATR] vowel /u/ in
the last syllable. In the male speech, the deletion of the velar stop makes possible the fusion between /a/ and
/u/, resulting in the [+ATR] mid-back vowel /o/, which then triggers vowel harmony in the first vowel (see
Chapter 2, ‘Phonology’, for a thorough description of vowel harmony).
4
Since there is a constraint against surface monosyllabic words (see Chapter 1, ‘Phonology’), the word for
‘night’ is lengthened in the citation form in male speech: ♂ ru > ruu ‘night’, but ♂ ruèb´) [ru""m´)] ‘at night’, ♂
rukuèb´) [ru""kum´)].
133The remaining coalescence processes take place when the low vowel /a/ is followed by a
back vowel. When the deletion of /k/ results in a sequence of /a/ plus the high back vowel
/u/, both vowels are fused, resulting in the mid back vowel /o/. If the k-dropping rule results
in a sequence of /a/ plus the mid back vowel /O/, the vowel /a/ is dropped:(5)(6)♀ bEraku♂ bero‘river’♀ rakuSi♂ roSi‘to eat’♀ wakOrE♂ wOrE‘a type of bird’♀ rahakOrE♂ rahOrE‘to turn over’If /k/ is deleted between the mid back vowel /o/ and the high back vowel /u/, the latter
is dropped:(7)♀ heÎoku♂ heÎo‘house’♀ kowoku♂ owo‘mortar’♀ ohokuÎIra♂ ohoÎIra‘to shoot at’♀ woku♂ wo‘inside’5A few examples may suggest that, with some lexical items, a syllable ku might have
indeed been inserted in the female speech forms. For example, corresponding to Southern
Karajá ♀ wiku ‘song’, ♂ wiu, the remaining dialects have ♀wiku, ♂wi.65Notice that, with ♀ woku ‘war; Tapirapé’, a homophone of ♀ woku ‘inside’, vowel fusion does not occur inmale speech: ♂ wou. The difference in behavior may have to do with differences in their morphological status.
While ‘inside’ always never occurs by itself, ‘Tapirapé, war’ may occur freely.
1343.1.2. Schwa assimilationIn cases in which the deletion of the velar stop results in a sequence of a schwa
followed by another vowel, the schwa assimilates the features of the following vowel. The
examples below are restricted to Southern and Northern Karajá (7), the ‘schwa-dialects’ (cf.
Chapter 1). This process also applies to loanwords, such as Îak´Si ‘taxi’ (♂ ÎaaSi).","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"
"284The explanation offered above (Table 10), however, has at least two major
advantages. First, it provides a unified treatment of final consonants (including cases that led
to schwa-formation, described in Chapter 2). Second, it is further confirmed by independent
internal evidence. Cluster formation resulting from syncope is attested, for instance, in
examples such as (12) below, where the prefix combination ka-r-a- is reduced to [kra]:(12)ka-r-a-rikaèkre

‘I will walk.’3.4.3 Karajá and the typology of infixationIn a recent study on infixation, Yu (2007) describes four different paths which may
lead to the creation of infixes: (1) metathesis, (2) entrapment (a “scenario in which a
morpheme is stranded between a fossilized composite of an affix and a root”), (3)
reduplication mutation, and (4) morphological excrescence and prosodic stem association.
The rather unusual development of the Karajá infix –r- does not seem to fit into any of such
likely scenarios (although, as I mention above, metathesis may be seen as a possible
alternative explanation). The development of –r-, however, seems to be closer to what Yu
describes as entrapment—except that, in our case, the morpheme was trapped by fossilized
phonological, rather than morphological, material. If the scenario here described is correct,
the notion of entrapment could be extended to deal with cases of phonological entrapment as
well, in addition to cases of morphological entrapment.","[295, 296]"

dialects consists in the occurrence in Southern and Northern Karajá of a schwa [´] in
unstressed positions, corresponding to environments in which Xambioá and Javaé generally
present a vowel identical to the one occurring in the following syllable:(13)KarajáJavaé, Xambioák´dO

-d´k´)
r´kUkOdO
bIdI
-d´)k´)
rUkU‘termite’
‘honey’
‘causative suffix’
‘gourd’As I mentioned above, another difference is the occurrence, in the Northern and
Southern Karajá dialects, of surface CCV syllables, resulting from a process of syncope of a
schwa occurring between a stop and the alveolar approximant /r/ (in male speech, this schwa
may surface due to the rule of k-dropping: ♂ ´rO ‘frog’, ´rE ‘kingfisher’). As expected,
Xambioá and Javaé present a vowel identical to the vowel in the following syllable and no
syncope takes place:(14)Karajá
k´rO [krO]
k´rE [krE]
b´rO [brO]Javaé, Xambioá
kOrO [kO""rO]
kErE [kE""rE]
bOrO [bO""rO]‘frog’
‘kingfisher’
‘back’31There are reasons to believe that Southern and Northern Karajá are, with respect to
the existence of the schwa, the most conservative dialects.10 The alternative would be to
consider the scenario occurring in Javaé and Xambioá as the most conservative, postulating
for Southern and Northern Karajá a rule of lenition of an unstressed vowel when followed by
a syllable containing an identical vowel. However, this hypothesis seems to be ruled out by
the existence, in Southern and Northern Karajá, of minimal pairs such as ♀ Îaka ‘to take off’
versus Î´ka ‘to tie’ (corresponding to a homophonous pair in Xambioá), as well as bOrO
[bO""rO] ‘stingray’ versus b´rO [brO] ‘back’ (corresponding to a homophonous pair in both
Javaé and Xambioá). However, the fact that the schwa occurs only in unstressed positions
makes its phonemic status problematic. This topic will be thoroughly investigated in Chapter
1.","[41, 42, 43]"
"2.1Subject agreement173Person agreement displays a strictly nominative pattern, with the verb always
agreeing with the subject, be it intransitive (2a) or transitive (2b). Person agreement markers

English or Portuguese, on the other, is that in Karajá there are no lexical opposites for
direction, such as English come versus go and bring versus take. In Karajá, such a
distinction is completely dependent on the morphological mechanisms that are made
available by the language. Thus, in the examples below, the prefix r- indicates that the event
is seen as occurring away from the current location of the speaker (centrifugal direction),

labeling the Karajá pospositions, I took into consideration what seems to be their more general, productive, and
non-idiomatic uses (as far as possible).

Kariri, a Macro-Jê language remotely related to Karajá, also has an evitative postposition (Mamiani 1877:77).
According to Blake (1994: 156), evitative (also called ‘aversive’) case markers are also common in Australian
languages.

Talmy (1985:129), who defines figure as “the salient moving or stationary object in a motion event” and path as
a category which “refers to the variety of paths followed, or sites occupied, by the Figure object.”

Although the range of meanings displayed by some of the Karajá pospositions may at first seem unusual, it is
very easy to find parallels in other, well-known languages such as English or Portuguese. The use of locative
postpositions with temporal purposes (as a metaphorical extension from location in space to location in time),
226name, think and tell (that is, the complements denoting that which is said, heard, thought,
asked, or told) are also marked by the postposition èb´) (15). As we will see, this semantic
diversity accounts for the use of this postposition to mark both purpose clauses and converbs,
as well as sentential complements of verbs such as say, tell, etc.6(11)♂a-r-∅-aèkre

for example, is a rather common phenomenon. Even more idiosyncratic uses of postpositions (as non-canonical
markers of what would be translated as direct objects in English) may also reflect cross-linguistic tendencies.
As Jespersen (1965:159) points out, verbs for ‘to throw’ take objects marked as instrumentals in many
languages, including Old Norse. The use of a locative posposition to mark the object of a verb such as ♀ rakuSi
‘to eat’ (♂ roSi) is paralleled in English by the use of on in constructions such as deer feed on grass or the
castaway lived on coconuts for weeks.
6
This apparent diversity of meanings could be due not to polysemy, but to homophony (that is, instead of these
being instances of different meanings associated with a single postposition, it could be the case that there would
be different postpositions with the same phonological shape). However, the fact that a postposition such as èb´)
presents the same irregular allomorphy in all the uses mentioned above seems to rule out the hypothesis of
accidental similarity.
227In addition to the paradigmatic peculiarities and wide range of semantic uses, the
‘diffuse locative’ postposition, èb´), presents some distributional peculiarities. As illustrated
by (16) below, in which èb´) occurs as a purpose marker, it can follow other postpositions (in
this case, the ‘static locative’ èkI). [The example also illustrates the use of the dative

"1-CTFG-INTR-move=FUT
‘I will go.’kanakre
ka-d-∅-aèk´re
1-CTPT-INTR-move=FUT
‘I will come.’The system of directional markers in Karajá presents characteristics that traditionally
define an inflectional category, such as obligatoriness, semantic and formal regularity, and
productivity (Anderson 1985:163; Bauer 1988:73-87; Bybee 1985:11). The existence of
direction as an inflectional category seems to be a fairly rare phenomenon. Talmy
(1985:135), for example, in a survey of grammatical categories, states categorically that
direction “is not marked inflectionally.” According to Bybee, this would be due to its lack of
lexical generality:By definition, an inflectional category must be applicable to all stems of the appropriate semantic
and syntactic category and must obligatorily occur in the appropriate syntactic context. In order
for a morphological process to be so general, it must have only minimal semantic content. If a
semantic element has high content, i.e. is very specific, it simply will not be applicable to a large
number of stems. [Bybee 1985:16-17]That is, since the category of direction would in principle be relevant only for motion
verbs, it would not apply to a sufficient number of verbs to constitute an inflectional
category. Thus, besides being commonly expressed lexically such as in Portuguese levar ‘to
take away’ versus trazer ‘to bring’ and English come versus go, and by clitics, direction is
also found expressed derivationally, such as in Latin eo¤ ‘I go’, ex-eo¤ ‘I go out’, trans-eo¤ ‘I go
across.’ However, as Bybee (op. cit., 17) observes, “each of these prefixes has a limited175lexical applicability, for they are only appropriately added to verbs indicating motion of some
sort. Their semantic content prevents them from meeting one of the criteria for inflectional
status.”
Bybee’s predictions apply well to languages such as Georgian, for example, where
the opposition between the particles mo ‘hither’ and mi ‘thither’ seems to be productive only
with lexemes denoting some sort of “notional direction towards a goal” (Manning
1996:250).33 However, in Karajá all verbs inflect for direction, including those that
apparently do not indicate a motion at all, such as UrU ‘to die’ (2) and EkÈw´TE ‘to get tired’
(3), as shown by the examples below:(4)a.b.rurure

also used for other purposes. Analyzing the use of the directional markers in narrative texts,
this section explores the hypothesis that directional inflection can be used to show empathy
relationships between the participants of the speech act and between narrator and characters33The grammatical category expressed by the opposition between the particles mo and mi is called ‘orientation’
in Georgian linguistics, whereas the term ‘direction’ is used to refer to another grammatical category, which
“consists of a multi-term system of preverbs, arranged in opposed doublets such as ‘in’ versus ‘out,’ ‘up’ versus
‘down,’ etc.” (Manning, op. cit., 250) The use of the term ‘direction’ in this paper coincides with Talmy’s (op.
cit., 135) definition: “[Direction] refers to whether the Figure in a Motion event is moving toward or away from
the speaker.”
176in a narrative text, playing a role similar to what in other languages may be performed by
obviation systems, evidentials, or attitude markers.
Centrifugal direction (‘thither’) is clearly the unmarked member of the
centrifugal/centripetal opposition. Not only it can, under certain circumstances, be marked
by a zero prefix, but it is also overwhelmingly more common in narrative and descriptive
texts and everyday verbal interactions. Descriptive predicates, marked with auxiliary clitics
which present directional markers, are always marked for centrifugal direction. Furthermore,
verbs in the imperfective (marked by the clitic èr-a) cannot inflect for centripetal direction
(an exception which remains to be explained) and there seem to be pragmatic restrictions as
to the occurrence of centripetal marking with verbs in the progressive (marked with the
auxiliary clitic èr-ErI). As we will see (Section 2.2.2), such restrictions demonstrate that
direction can clearly be used with evidential purposes.","[186, 187, 188]"

"5.2.2 The nasal high front vowel /¸¸)/Another vowel ignored by Rodrigues (1999), but whose phonemic status was
recognized by Fortune and Fortune (1963) and Cavalcante (1992), is the nasal front vowel /¸)/,
which occurs in very few examples, such as h¸) ‘(a woman’s) older brother’ (which forms a
‘minimal trio’ with hi ‘cry’ and hI ‘to drive away’), a)h¸) ‘mosquito’11, kud¸) [ku""ni] ‘spirit,
ghost’, and the extremely productive derivational suffix -d¸) [ni]‘similar to’. The contrast
between /¸)/ and its oral counterpart is demonstrated by the minimal pair in (34) below.
Another minimal pair, ra¸)èra ‘I stood up’ (35b) vs. raièra ‘I laid down’ (36b), can be
explained morphologically as the result of the deletion of the nasal vowel in the root -´)i ‘to
stand up’ and the transference of the nasality to the stressed vowel:1210With some loans, different forms may coexist, varying as to the degree of adaptation. That is the case of the
Portuguese loan for ‘bread’ (Portuguese pão). The form [ma""o)] is said to be used only by those with little or no
knowledge of Portuguese; the less adapted forms [ba""o)] or even [pa""o)] are more commonly used.
11
The word for ‘mosquito’, a)h¸), is probably of onomatopoeic origin. Another onomatopoeic word containing
/¸)/ is [s¸)""ka], the name of a bad-omen bird.
12
Another example of nasal stability under vowel deletion, also involving the nasal mid-central vowel /´)/,
occurs with the root h´) ‘to be’, when it is prefixed with the 1st person prefix wa- (cf. (a) below; for additional
details on this root, which becomes grammaticalized as a habitual marker, see Chapter 5). Thus, there is yet
another (superficial) minimal pair for the contrast between /a/ and /a)/: wahaèr-e ‘(he) is my father’ [wa""hare]

"265Besides the scarcity of data on some of its now-extinct members, such as the
languages belonging to the Purí and Kamakã families, Macro-Jê comparative studies run into
problems that typically plague long-range comparativists: roots are generally isolating and
monosyllabic, and syllabic patterns are rather simple. Since most likely cognates tend to be
of the CV type, there is a greater risk of accidental similarities. That risk is particularly
increased by an apparent neglect to abide by the comparative method when proposing
cognates. A case in point is the work of Aryon Rodrigues, a major Brazilian scholar, on
comparative Macro-Jê linguistics. Besides adding little to the cognate sets already identified
by previous authors (Guérios, Loukotka), Rodrigues’ cognate inventories (Rodrigues 1999,
Rodrigues & Cabral 2007) illustrate primary methodological mistakes, including an obvious
case of borrowing (the word for ‘maize’, which is likely of Arawák origin; cf. Ribeiro 2010)
and assigning cognate words to wrong cognate sets--for instance, Kaingáng krE) ‘egg’ is
considered a cognate of the word for ‘egg’ in other Jê languages, which trace back to ProtoJê *NrE, even though (as Davis had already demonstrated) Kaingáng preserved Proto-Jê *N as
/N/; Kaingáng krE) traces back to Proto-Jê kra ‘offspring’ instead. As examples such as this
illustrate, little attention is given to phonological regularity, even in the case of a fairly wellestablished family as Jê. Rodrigues’ main contribution to comparative Macro-Jê studies was
the detection of shared morphological similarities which are likely due to common
inheritance (Rodrigues 1992, 2000b; Ribeiro 2011). Particularly relevant for Karajá are the
so-called “relational prefixes”, linking morphemes discussed in Section 3.2 below (cf.
Chapter 4 as well).
While Macro-Jê comparative linguistics has been marked by an overall lack of
methodological soundness, resulting in questionable proposals of genetic relationship (as266illustrated by the inclusion of Guató), it has attracted, on the other hand, unfounded
pessimism. A case in point is Dixon & Aikhenvald’s (1999:18) claim that the similarities
among the several families within Macro-Jê would be due to areal, rather than genetic,
factors:“Rather than all the Macro-Je families being related in a higher-level tree, it seems to
us that they could constitute a long-term linguistic area; this would account for their
considerable typological similarities. (There may, of course, be genetic links between
some of the established families, within the linguistic area.)”
Such suggestion reveals a lack of familiarity with the evidence put forth by authors such as
Guérios, Loukotka, Davis, Gudschinsky, Boswood, and Rodrigues—mostly items of basic
vocabulary, such as body-part terms, and grammatical morphemes. Although not as robust
as one would wish (due in part to the temporal depth involved), such evidence points to
genetic, rather than areal, relationship.29 Furthermore, the typological similarities alluded to
by Dixon & Aikhenvald are common in lowland South America, and thus do not set MacroJê languages apart as a group.
Macro-Jê is, to a certain extent, reminiscent of North America’s Algic, in the sense
that, in both cases, there is a close-knit, well-established family (Algoquian; Jê, in our case)
and a number of distantly-related families or isolates (Wiyot and Yurok; Karajá, Ofayé, and
several others, in our case). A major difference is that there is even more internal diversity in
Macro-Jê, suggesting that it is even older than Algic. If, as Goddard (1991:64) states,
“Algonquian, Wiyot, and Yurok form a genetic grouping that is at, or very close to, the
maximum depth at which it is possible to reconstruct features of the protolanguage that retain
any appreciable degree of resolution,” Macro-Jê may provide an even fuzzier picture. For
29Similar objections against Dixon & Aikhenvald’s claims are raised by Voort (2004:213).
267most of the stock, however, regular phonological and grammatical correspondences are still
being uncovered, but one has to keep in mind the limitations mentioned by Goddard (op. cit.)
for Algic:
“[…] it is methodologically instructive to note that this is a case in which the
comparative method produces a proof of genetic relationship without there being a
reconstructed phonology or phonological history beyond what is implied by a handful
of equations of identity, or near identity.”","[276, 277, 278, 279]"

is indicated by prefixes, which coincide in part with those occurring as direct objects
(incorporated into the verb) or objects of postpositions. Most noun and verb stems can be
divided into two lexical classes, which I will label i-class and Î-class, after the third-person
prefixes taken by nouns in each class. As illustrated below by the paradigms for kOrU
‘forehead’ (34) and EbO ‘hand’ (35), the differences are not limited to the third person.
While i-class paradigms are more straightforward in terms of segmentation, Î-class
paradigms present a ‘linking prefix’ when the possessor is a noun or a first person
pronominal prefix, and a zero-prefix for the second person:(34)a.ha)bu kOrU‘man’s forehead’

Whereas the i-class prefix series distinguishes a reflexive third person (Îa-) from a
non-reflexive one (i-), the Î-class series has only one third person prefix (Î-), which covers
the range of meanings of both reflexive and non-reflexive third persons. Furthermore, Î-class
stems present a linking prefix in the first person (wa-d-EbO ‘my hand’), when preceded by a
nominal possessor (ha)bu d-EbO ‘the man’s hand’), or in their citation forms (d-EbO ‘hand’).
The linking prefix has two allomorphs whose choice does not seem to be conditioned
synchronically: d- (d-EbO ‘hand’, d-o)ho) ‘pet’, etc.) and l- (l-OÎI ‘throat’, l-UahI ‘medicine’,
etc.). The function of this prefix is synchronically fairly opaque, but its distribution
resembles that of the so-called relational prefixes, linking morphemes described for other
Macro-Jê languages (Rodrigues 2000), as well as languages from the Tupí stock and the
Karíb family (Rodrigues 2009). As discussed in Chapter 5, the occurrence of such linking
prefixes in Karajá may provide further evidence for its inclusion in the Macro-Jê stock.
Throughout this dissertation, Î-class noun stems will be cited preceded by the linking prefix.","[52, 53]"
"2.2 Temporal constructions7As in English or Portuguese, the verb aha ‘to find’ is also used with an ‘evaluative’ meaning (as in I found the
play annoying). In this case, the evaluative phrase is marked by the postposition èb´):

229The semantics of some postpositions can be further illustrated by their use in
temporal constructions. In addition to the temporal postposition proper, èku, locative èb´)
and instrumental èdI were also attested in temporal uses: rukuèb´) ‘at night’, rukuèdI ‘at
dawn’; bikuraTOèku ‘in the morning’, bikuraTOèb´) ‘tomorrow’; etc. The use of èdI
‘instrumental’ in rukuèdI ‘at dawn’ (literally, ‘after night’) mirrors its use with subordinate
clauses such as (22) below:(22)k´-d-∅-EhEb´)d´)èkreèdI
a-r-∅-aèkre
3-CTPT-INTR-arrive=FUTèINSTR 1-CTFG-go=FUT
‘After he arrives, I will go.’3. Relative clausesFor the sake of terminological clarity, I will adopt here the basic terminology
employed by Keenan (1985). Like Keenan, I regard relative clauses to be full NPs (a fact that
is rather clear in Karajá, where relative clauses can take articles, as we have seen, and
postpositions, as it will be shown below). As Keenan points out, a relative clause typically
consists of a common noun (or a pronoun), the domain noun, optionally accompanied by
determiners, and a restrictive clause: “Semantically the common noun determines a class of
objects, which we shall call the domain of relativization, and the restrictive clause identifies a
subset of the domain, those elements which satisfy the conditions given by the restrictive
clause” (Keenan 1985: 142). Thus, in Îori dOrOède! ‘a White man who arrived’, Îori ‘White
man’ is the domain noun, and dOrOède! ‘who arrived’ is the restrictive clause.
As we have seen, the only surface difference between the independent clause in (1)
and its subordinate counterpart in (2) is in the location of the stress: [Îo""ri do""rode] ‘the White230man came ashore’ versus [Îo""ri doro""de] ‘the White man who came ashore’. In fact, stress
shift is the basic mechanism to mark the subordinate status of relative clauses that modify
core NPs (that is, subjects and direct objects). That the subordinate clause occupies the
position of an NP is further demonstrated by the fact that it can be followed by the enclitic
indefinite article ♀ èdo), ♂ èo) (24), which attaches to the rightmost element of an NP (23). In
addition, an NP modified by a subordinate clause can still act as a possessor, and, in these
cases, the possessed noun will occur after the subordinate clause (25).9 Notice that the
relative clause is postnominal, occurring after the modified noun. This fact, as we will see
(Section 6), reflects the general distribution of modifiers in attributive constructions.","[240, 241, 242]"

In narrative texts, especially those narrated mostly in 3rd person, directional inflection
is frequently used to signal which character the speaker chooses to be more relevant for the
story, by assigning to him or her the role of deictic center. This function of the directional
markers in Karajá is similar to the role played by obviation systems, such as the one
occurring in Algonquian languages. In these languages, according to Dahlstrom (1999:36),
“if more than one third person is mentioned within a certain syntactic domain, then the third
person most central to the discourse is referred to by proximate forms (of nouns, pronouns, or
verb agreement) and the more peripheral third persons are referred to by obviative forms.”
The factors involved on assigning proximate or obviative status are mostly semantic or
discursive. Thus, “if one of the two third persons is a human and the other is (notionally)
inanimate, the human will always be proximate and the inanimate third person will always be
obviative.” When both third persons are humans, “the third person chosen as proximate is
often the one the speaker feels closest to, such as a relative of the speaker as opposed to a
nonrelative, a Mesquakie as opposed to an Indian of another tribe, or an Indian as opposed to182a non-Indian.” However, Dahlstrom remarks that these are tendencies, “not hard and fast
rules” (Dahlstrom op. cit., 44-45).
In Karajá, quite interesting is the fact that, in choosing the character to whom to
assign higher discourse prominence, objective factors such as physical closeness to the
speaker can be overcome by factors such as the place where crucial actions are taking place.
Thus, in the short text presented here, ‘The Hawk and the Snake’ (16), the hawk is initially
chosen as the deictic center, as shown by the opposition between the verb forms robière
‘he/she saw (thither),’ in Line D, and dobiède ‘he/she saw (hither),’ in Line E. Notice that at
this point the hawk is flying in the sky. The choice of ‘sky’ as opposed to ‘ground’ is not
exactly what one would expect if a purely anthropocentric perspective were adopted.","[193, 194]"

Although one would expect the relational prefix with i-initial Î-class stems to be dZ-, that is not the case. The
only two stems I am aware of, -iru and -ira, occur with no linking prefix: cf. kOwOrU iru ‘tree branches’. The
relational prefix is reconstructed as *j- for Proto-Jê, a form which may be close to the one present in ProtoMacro-Jê. If the form of the relational prefix was something similar to *j- in Pre-Proto-Karajá, the prefix could
have coalesced with the initial vowel of i-initial Î-stems.

Besides palatalization of the suffix consonant (lahi-di > lahidZi), the deverbal noun lahadZi ‘the action of
cursing’ exemplifies two other phonological processes, dissimilation (> lahidZi > lah´dZi) and total harmony
across /h/ (> lah´dZi > lahadZi).

vowels /i/, /È/ and /u/ and their [-ATR] counterparts /I/, /È/, and /U/ is recognized.
Palatalization is clearly a lexical, word-internal process. Therefore, although it can be
triggered between affixes and roots and between elements in a compound, it does not occur
across word boundaries (between nouns and adpositions, for example, or between different
words in an NP). As the examples below show, palatalization can be a useful criterion in
distinguishing compounds and phrases. In (91a), a compound, the last vowel of ba)ki ‘corn’
triggers palatalization on the initial consonant of T´bo) ‘small’; on the other hand,
palatalization does not occur in (91b), a phrase:39(91)♀a.ba)ki-T´bo)[maÆkiS´""mo)] b.corn-small
‘rice’ba)kiT´bo)[maÆkiT´""mo)]corn small
‘small (type of) corn’In addition, inflectional prefixes d- ‘centripetal direction’ and Î- ‘2nd person’ do not
undergo palatalization when attached to stems beginning with a high [+ATR] vowel, thus
contrasting sharply with Î- ‘3rd person’ and d- ~ ‘relational’ which, as we have seen,
undergo palatalization under the same circumstances.","[130, 131]"

recent loans such as kara ‘yam’ (< Portuguese cará, ultimately from Tupinambá kará) andkabE ‘coffee’ (< Portuguese café), whose low vowels do not get nasalized upon the dropping

[ATR] quality of the first vowel is not a systematic correspondence among the dialects; other
sporadic cases of similar mismatches are discussed below (see Section 5.2, ‘Palatalization’)).
There seems to be a correlation between [+ATR]-ness and nasalization, as suggested by the
contrast between dIar´) and dZia)r´) (see also lUahI ‘medicine’ vs. Îohokua) ‘newborn’). A

investigations.

examples in (32).10 At any rate, the phonemic contrast between /a/ and /a)/ does not need to
rely on minimal pairs such as the ones in (33), since their distribution is unpredictable even
within the native lexicon.","[99, 100, 101]"
"205Whereas the i-class prefix series distinguishes a reflexive third person (Îa-) from a
non-reflexive one (i-), the Î-class series has only one third person prefix (Î-), which covers
the range of meanings of both reflexive and non-reflexive third persons. Furthermore, the Îclass stem -EbO ‘hand’ presents a prefix d- in the first person and when preceded by a
nominal possessor. The function of this prefix is synchronically fairly opaque, but its
distribution resembles that of relational prefixes, linking prefixes which have been described
for several other Macro-Jê families. Relational prefixes were first described as a
grammatical peculiarity of Tupí-Guaraní languages, and their occurrence in languages of
Karíb and Macro-Jê stocks, as well as in languages of other branches within the Tupí stock,
has been pointed out as evidence for a genetic relationship among these three groups
(Rodrigues 1994). Such linking prefixes are very likely cognates with similar morphemes in
Jê and other families within Macro-Jê (Ribeiro 2004, 2005b, 2011) and provide further
corroboration for the inclusion of Karajá in the Macro-Jê stock (see Chapter 6).","[216, 217]"
"5. Adverbial clausesKarajá apparently has few, if any, true adverbial clauses, a fact that mirrors the
overall lack of adverbs in the language.19 Corresponding to locative adverbs (‘here’, ‘there’,
‘hither’, ‘thither’) and temporal adverbs (‘yesterday’, ‘tomorrow’), Karajá has demonstrative
pronouns (ka ‘proximal’, k´da) ‘distal’) followed by postpositions (kaèkI ‘here’; ♀ kaèku, ♂kaèu ‘yesterday’; ♀ k´da)èku, ♂ k´da)èu ‘the day before yesterday; the day after tomorrow’).
Corresponding to manner adverbs (‘quickly’, ‘swiftly,’ etc.), Karajá has nouns followed by
the postposition èb´) (wÈèb´) ‘quickly,’ etc.). Thus, just as most adverbial functions are
played by postpositional phrases, functions traditionally associated with adverbial clauses are
played by ‘postpositional clauses’ in Karajá. Below are examples of allative, locative, and
temporal clauses:(51)♀i-r´bI a-hEèb´)

19One candidate for adverbhood would be widZi ‘today, now’. The locative morphemes ÎU, Îab´), and Îai
(which, as we have seen, are suppletive third-person forms of postpositions) could also be alternatively
analyzed as adverbs. Even if these morphemes are considered as adverbs, this would be a closed class in
Karajá.

Notice that the adverbial-like subordinate clauses above are structurally identical to
relative clauses which modify oblique domain nouns (as seen in Section 3 above), except for
the lack of a domain noun. That is, the locative clauses above can be analyzed as headless
relative clauses. This structural identity between relative clauses and adverbial clauses is not
unusual. As Thompson & Longacre (1985:179) point out, adverbial clauses expressing time,
location, and manner can commonly be paraphrased, in many languages, “with a relative
clause with a generic and relatively semantically empty head noun: time, place, and
way/manner, respectivelly;” such clauses have also in common the fact that they can be
replaced by a single word, an adverb, such as today (time), here (location), and quickly
(manner) in English and other languages with a clear class of adverbs.","[253, 254]"

previously studied, interesting phenomena have been traditionally overlooked. For example,
the processes of vowel fusion illustrated above (♀ bEraku :: ♂ bero) can apply across
morpheme boundaries, a fact that can render the morphological segmentation less obvious in
the male speech. This occurs, for example, with intransitive verbs, which are generally
marked by the prefix a-. In the male speech, this prefix can be fused with the first vowel of
the verb stem under the same conditions shown above:(4)(5)♀♀rakub´Î´)rErI♂rob´Î´)rErI∅-r-a-kub´Î´)èr-ErI

‘S/he is going up.’Furthermore, one of the main shortcomings of Fortune & Fortune’s (1975) and
Borges’s (1994, 1997) works is their lack of a comparative, pan-dialectal perspective.
Although differences between male and female speech are present throughout all the dialects
(and, therefore, probably predate their diversification), all the previous studies limit
themselves to one single dialect. Thus, while Ehrenreich’s pioneering remarks are likely
based mainly on data of the Xambioá dialect, Fortune and Fortune’s account is based on
Northern Karajá, and Borges’s on Southern Karajá.
Thus, data of Javaé, the most divergent of the four dialects, were never seriously
considered. According to Fortune & Fortune (1963), the differences between male and25female speech would not occur in Javaé. Both males and females would speak what
corresponds to the male speech in [Northern] Karajá. However, this information, based
likely on the opinion of speakers of Northern Karajá, is not completely accurate. In fact,
differences between male and female speech do occur in Javaé, although to a lesser extent.
Interestingly, in Javaé the distinctions between female and male speech are much less
remarkable than in the other three dialects, in the sense that many forms used exclusively by
males in Xambioá, Northern Karajá, and Southern Karajá, are also used by females in Javaé.
Another important aspect of male vs. female speech distinctions in Karajá is the fact
that there are different degrees of obligatoriness as to the deletion of /k/ in male speech. The
three personal pronouns provide a useful illustration: while k-deletion is obligatory with the
first-person pronoun (♀ dIkar´), ♂ dIar´)), it does not happen with the second-person pronoun
(kai), and it is optional with the third-person pronoun (Î´kI, ♂ ÎII).
Gender-related speech differences such as the ones found in Karajá (and Koasati
(1964), Chiquitano (Falkinger 2002), etc.) can be seen as a matter of gender deixis, in the
sense that, as Folley (1997) points out, “some actual linguistic elements are indexicals of
some fact about gender […]. The choice of a set of forms over the other can be said to point
directly to the speaker’s sex.” Throughout this dissertation, the symbols ♀ ‘female’ and ♂
‘male’ will be used to indicate such deitic value of a morpheme. Since forms such as kai andÎ´kI can be used by both male and female speakers, they are left unmarked.
Chapter 3 undertakes a thorough description of the differences between female and
male speech in Karajá, taking into consideration for the first time data from the four different26dialects and approaching facts that were not mentioned in previous studies. Possible
scenarios for the diachronic origin of such distinctions will also be discussed.","[35, 36, 37, 38]"
"8.2.2 StressThe position of the stress is predictable: in general, it falls on the last syllable of the
(isolated) word (10). However, ‘minimal pairs’ for stress can appear in a phrasal level, a fact
which is due to the contrast between intrinsically stressed and unstressed words (11).
Furthermore, there is at least one circumstance in which stress shift is grammatically
meaningful: subordination (12; see Chapter 5).",[41]

‘Irabure ceremonial mask’’Some Tapirapé groups roamed even further east, settling in the interior of the Bananal
Island (their presence being mentioned by early reports on the Karajá, such as Fonseca’s).
There, according to the oral histories of both tribes, they would have mixed with the
ancestors of present-day Javaé, contributing to set this Karajá-speaking group apart—
culturally and linguistically—from the remaining of the tribe (see Chapter 3). In addition to
Tapirapé loans such as the ones listed in Table 2, which are common to all Karajá dialects, a
few are restricted to the Javaé dialect. That is the case, for instance, of the word for
‘garbage’, Javaé hÈÎÈ (< Tapirapé /ÈtÈ), and proper nouns such as Kujamõkõ (cf. Ribeiro
2001), all of which suggest a more intimate contact than a merely commercial one. There are11also several cultural features shared by the Tapirapé and the Javaé, but not the other Karajá
groups.
There is an epilogue in the history of contacts between the Karajá and the Tapirapé.
In the 1940s, following a drastic population drop resulting from attacks by the Kaiapó
(Northern Jê), the surviving Tapirapé came to live near a Northern Karajá village at the
mouth of the Tapirapé River. From relatively sporadic, contact between both tribes came to
become permanent, resulting in many interethnic marriages characterized by a situation of
domestic bilingualism with relative equilibrium between both languages. Recently, after
having recovered their traditional lands in the west, most Tapirapé left the Araguaia, taking
along the many additional Karajá influences acquired in the past half a century. Most mixed
families, however, remained behind. Among these, the effects of language contact can be
felt not only in the lexicon, but also in the phonology and syntax; such situation is a
fascinating topic for future studies.
Another tribe with whom the Karajá were in close contact were the Kaiapó
(karalahU), speakers of a Northern Jê language. At the beginning of the 19th century, the
Kaiapó lived in the area between the lower Araguaia and the Tocantins, according to early
historians (Cunha Mattos (1874-1875[1824]), Silva e Souza (1842[1812])). Due to the
invasion of their territory by cattle ranchers, they begin a gradual migration towards west,
across the Araguaia and into Pará. When Coudreau and Krause visited the area, between
1890 and 1910, all Kaiapó-speaking tribes were already settled west of the Araguaia River.
The first wave of Kaiapó migrants were the ancestors of the present-day Xikrin, who would
have migrated in the first decades of the 19th century (Vidal 1977). Marching west, they
would establish peaceful contacts with the northernmost Karajá-speaking group, the12Xambioá. As a result of such contacts, the Kaiapó borrowed a number of cultural elements
(with their terminology) from Xambioá. The linguistic loans include not only terms referring
to items of material and ceremonial culture, but possibly even a relationship term, bikwa
‘relative’ (< Karajá bIkOwa ‘friend, companion’, ♂ bIOwa). Additional waves of Kaiapó
would progressively migrate west, this time mostly through Northern Karajá territory, and far
from peacefully (I have recorded, among the Northern Karajá of Santana do Araguaia,
narratives of such conflicts). While some of these late migrants would end up being
catechized by the missionaries and absorbed into the regional population, disappearing as an
ethnic group, most continued their migration towards west, ending up as far away as the
Xingu River. Currently, no Kaiapó-speaking groups live near the Araguaia.","[22, 23, 24]"

‘he hit me’Finally, examples involving the nasalization of /b/ and /d/ also seem to corroborate
the need for postulating the existence of a schwa in the proto-language. As we have seen, a
form such as -d´k´) [d´k´)] ‘causative’ (Xambioá and Javaé -d´k´) [n´)""k´)]) may occur without
the velar stop in male speech. As a consequence of k-deletion, the schwa assimilates all the
features of the following vowel (-d´´) > -d´)´)), but the consonant remains oral: [d´)""´)].
Examples such as this demonstrate the need to differentiate cases such as ba)na) [m´""na]
‘stone’, where the schwa results from the dissimilation of a nasal vowel, from -d´k´) ~ d´)´)
[d´""k´) ~ d´)""´)] ‘causative’, where the schwa is originally an oral vowel.
23It is interesting to notice the contrast between forms such as (46b) and those containing the intransitive
marker a-; although the phonological environment would be presumably the same, the intransitive form is
hEÎE. This suggests that object markers have a more ‘intimate’ relationship with the verb stem than inflectional
prefixes such as the intransitive marker (even if, on the surface, they seem to be occurring in the ‘same’
position). A similar state of affairs—the fact that palatalization is restricted to certain prefixes (equivalent to
Lexical Phonology’s level 1 affixes)—is discussed below.
995.2.3.3 Schwa vs. /ǨǨ /Considering that its occurrence is limited to unstressed positions, could the schwa be
treated as an allophone of a full vowel phoneme? The vowel phoneme whose articulatory
characteristics are closer to the schwa is the mid-central [+ATR] vowel /Ǩ/. Considering that
this vowel occurs mostly in stressed position, it seems to be in complementary distribution
with the schwa.24 There are, however, a few examples in which /Ǩ/ occurs in unstressed
position; these examples, however, would not pose a problem to an analysis in terms of
complementary distribution, since the schwa does not seem to occur in such positions (47ce). At any rate, treating the schwa as an allophone of /Ǩ/ or any other phoneme would be a
rather arbitrary solution, given its origin as the result of dissimilation of any vowel in the
inventory.","[110, 111]"
"6.3 Interactions between vowel harmony and palatalizationAs we have seen, palatalization is clearly a lexical process in Karajá, whereas vowel
harmony is likely a post-lexical one, occuring across word-boundaries; vowel harmony and
palatalization would be, in traditional terms, in counter-feeding order. There are, however, at
least two cases in which vowel harmony clearly feeds palatalization. These can be seen as
old compounds, which are not synchronically perceived as such. One is the kinship terma)dZikura ‘mother’s older sister’, which results probably from the combination of the
morphemes a)dI ‘mother’ and kura ‘white’41 (compare it with waha ‘my father’ versuswahakura ‘my father’s older brother’). In this case, the high [+ATR] vowel /u/ triggers
vowel harmony in the [-ATR] vowel of the preceding root, which then triggers palatalization
on the voiced stop /d/, as shown by the derivation given below:(96)41input

123Another example in which vowel harmony seems to have fed palatalization is the
particle tSibo ‘approximately’, which is probably the combination of the pro-form ÎI and the
interrogative particle èbo (ÎIbo [""Îibo] ‘how?’ > tSibo):42(97)input

repetition. The entire verb root is reduplicated (98). Again, a bimoraic minimality constraint
is at play: when the root is monosyllabic, reduplication includes all the verb prefixes:(98)(99)a.b-∅-I-krOèkre

analyses of the language, the analysis presented here proposes a larger vowel inventory; a
major contribution of the present analysis lies in demonstrating the relevance of the feature
[ATR] ‘advanced tongue root’, as evidenced by a pervasive process of vowel harmony. The
reanalysis of the vocalic inventory has substantial consequences for the analysis of the
consonantal inventory as well: palatal consonants, considered as independent phonemes in
previous analysis, are the result of a process of palatalization around [high, +ATR] vowels.
Although the distribution of palatal consonants is fairly predictable from a morphologicallyinformed point of view, a process of phonogenesis seems to be taking place: in addition to
the adoption of loanwords which violate native phonotactic constraints, there are even
minimal pairs (cf. idZ´d´) ‘feces’ vs i-r´d´) ‘his feces’), albeit morphologically conditioned.
Such factors result in a fluid situation in which palatal consonants may end up acquiring
phonological status.","[134, 135, 136]"
"5. Previous sourcesThe Karajá language has been mentioned since the mid-19th century, mainly in works
by naturalists, ethnographers, and voyagers, who collected vocabularies (Castelnau 1851,
Coudreau 1897, Ehrenreich 1891, Sócrates 1892, Krause 1911, Brito Machado 1947, Sekelj
1948). There is also a grammatical essay published by a Dominican missionary, Luiz Palha
(1942). Most of the descriptive work on Karajá, however, was done by David and Gretchen15Fortune, from the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), who have been working on the
Northern Karajá dialect since 1958, with the main goal of translating the Bible (the New
Testament has already been published (1983)). Their descriptive works are restricted to a
few articles (most of which are unpublished), including a phonological description (Fortune
and Fortune 1963), two grammatical essays (Fortune and Fortune 1964; Fortune 1975), and a
study of the differences between men and women’s speech (Fortune and Fortune 1975).
More recent works include Maia’s (1986[1998]) description of typological aspects of Javaé
(based on Fortune’s description of the Northern Karajá dialect), Cavalcante’s description of
the phonology of Southern Karajá (1992), Viana’s MA thesis on the expression of the
attribute (1995), my own MA thesis on verb morphology (Ribeiro 1996), and Borges’ (1997)
study on the differences between male and female speech. While preparing this dissertation,
I presented preliminary findings in several conferences; some of such talks resulted in
publications (Ribeiro 2001b, 2002, 2003, 2004)
Thus, the history of Karajá language documentation can be divided between two
clearly-distinct phases. The early phase, spanning roughly a century (between Castelnau and
Sekelj), consists of data collected by a naturalist (Castelnau), a geographer (Coudreau),
ethnographers (Ehrenreich, Krause), a missionary (Palha), a journalist (Sekelj), and
government employees (Sócrates, Britto Machado), in impressionistic, pre-IPA
transcriptions. The second phase, starting in the late 1950s with the Fortunes, is being
conducted by professional, academically-trained linguists, either on a descriptive fashion or
following theoretical trends of the day.
Of the early accounts, Ehrenreich (1894) is the first one who tries—with a relative
degree of success--to provide an analysis of the data, comparing previous vocabularies with16his own (collected from Xambioá speakers), segmenting and identifying grammatical
morphemes, hinting at the conservative nature of female speech, mentioning possible lexical
exchanges with Xingu tribes, and discussing von den Steinen’s inclusion of Karajá in his
Tapuya-Stämme. Krause, the first researcher to visit the Javaé, provides a vocabulary of the
latter, in addition to a more extensive Southern Karajá vocabulary. He also collected a text,
which he attempts to segment and translate—largely unsuccessfully. By the time of Krause’s
visit, Dominican missionaries were already firmly established in the town of Conceição do
Araguaia (which grew out of a mission founded in 1888), near the Northern Karajá and the
Xambioá, where they managed to pacify local Kaiapó groups. A few decades later, one of
such missionaries, Friar Luiz Palha, would produce a short essay on the Karajá language
(Palha 1942), which, given all the time he spent visiting Northern Karajá and Xambioá
villages, is disappointingly superficial.4
As one would expect, such works, based on data transcribed using the orthographies
with which the authors were familiar (Portuguese, French, and German), fail to capture the
phonological minutiae of the language. Furthermore, mistranslations were not uncommon,
considering that the data were collected at a time when few—if any—Karajá were fully
bilingual. Although their value as language documentation may be negligible, such works
have important historical and diagnostic value. A few lexical items recorded in these
wordlists have since fallen into disuse. For instance, the word ¸)ÎadZuwa ‘money’, a likely
4One of the Xambioá speakers I interviewed, Madalena Areraki (which was in her 80s at the time of my last
visit to the Xambioá (1998)), still remembered Friar Luiz and the missionary school in Conceição do Araguaia,
to where she was taken as a child. Many Xambioá and Northern Karajá children would be taken to the
missionary school, an institution that further contributed to the cultural downfall of the region’s Indians. There
they would be offered a Christian education to wean them out of their original culture and turn them into
“useful citizens”; many would end up as servants in Brazilian homes. Madalena’s father, noticing how
miserable she was at the school (she especially missed tobacco, obviously forbidden by the missionaries), took
her back to her people (apparently, without the knowledge of the missionaries). Madalena would become the
matriarch of a significant portion of the Xambioá population; her daughter, now in her 60s, is a fluent speaker
of Xambioá and a strong advocate for cultural revitalization among her tribesmen.
17loan from Língua Geral (cf. Tupinambá itajúba), is only documented in Socrates’ (1892)
vocabulary (printed as intadiná, for intadiuá); it would later be replaced by d¸)eru [nie""ru], a
Portuguese loan (< dinheiro). A Portuguese loan for ‘suit, jacket’, [mari""ÎO] (< Portuguese
paletó), documented by both Machado and Sekelj, illustrates the full adaptation—not only in
terms of phonological inventory, but of phonotactics as well—of a loan containing a bilabial
stop before /a/; as the Karajá become more familiar with Portuguese, such adaptations tend to
be less thorough (Ribeiro 2001a).5 Furthermore, as it will be suggested in Chapter 2
(‘Female versus male speech’), Castelnau’s wordlist may help put to rest a theory, set forth
by Rodrigues (1999, 2004), according to which the differences between male and female
speech were due to Xavánte influence. Old wordlists are also useful in discussing the use of
k-preserving forms by male speakers (see Chapter 3) and in evaluating whether the use of
non-possessed body-part terms as citation forms would have been a result of Portuguese
influence (see Chapter 4).
Among the authors from the second phase, few bring additional contributions to the
descriptive knowledge of the language, beyond what has been produced by the Fortunes.
Maia’s MA thesis, Aspectos Tipológicos da Língua Javaé (1986), later published as a book
(1998), is a case in point. Although apparently devoted to the Javaé dialect, its title is
misleading, since none of the morphological characteristics particular to Javaé are
mentioned. His analysis is essentially dependent on the description of the Northern Karajá
dialect provided by the Fortunes, failing to notice important grammatical phenomena such as
noun incorporation and voice inflection. His transcription of the data, relying on the5As we will see (Chapter 1), Karajá does not have a voiceless bilabial stop /p/, for which /b/ is substituted in
loans; however, the oral allophone of /b/ does not occur before /a/ in the native lexicon of the language.
Another loan illustrating the same constraint is Xambioá [mabE""ra] ‘paper’ (< Língua Geral papéra), mentioned
above (Table 1).
18orthography designed by the Fortunes, also leads to analytical problems: since the current
orthography does not represent stress, the use of stress shift to signal subordination went
unnoticed (see Chapter 5).
As mentioned in some of the following chapters, Maia’s works often illustrate the
risks of doing theoretical linguistics without a solid descriptive grasp of a language. In
contrast, the present dissertation has an essentially descriptive goal. However, although not
subordinated to any theoretical framework in particular, it intends to contribute to theoretical
linguistics by describing phenomena—previously undocumented for Karajá and other South
American languages—which may help shed light into broader theoretical issues.
While there is no comprehensive grammar or dictionary of the Karajá language, there
are a number of fairly-detailed accounts of Karajá culture (Ehrenreich 1891, Krause 1911,
Donahue 1982, Petesch 2001, Toral 1992, Lima Filho 1994, Rodrigues 2006). Most of such
anthropological monographs are very useful sources for understanding the social context in
which Karajá is spoken. The differences between male and female speech, for instance, are
part of a wider set of well-differentiated gender roles, whose details can be found in the
anthropological literature. They also describe cultural contacts between the Karajá and
neighboring tribes, largely corroborated by the loanwords described here, and offer more or
less detailed accounts of the history of the Karajá-speaking peoples. Works on neighboring
tribes, such as the Kaiapó (Vidal 1977, Verswijger 1992) and, especially, the Tapirapé
(Baldus 1970, Wagley 1977), are also very useful.
An indirect source on the Karajá and their language are the many semi-fictitious
jungle-adventure novels which became very popular in the mid-1900s (some of which even
include Karajá vocabularies) by popular authors such as Willy Aureli (1940, 1963, 1964,191966), José Mauro de Vasconcelos (1979), Hermano Ribeiro da Silva (1935), and Tibor
Sekelj--who, in addition to a children’s book about the adventures of a Karajá boy, published
originally in Esperanto (1979), also produced a journalistic article on the Karajá (1948),
mentioned above. As one may suppose, such books are more useful as windows into
national perception of the Indians than as reliable information sources on Karajá language
and culture. Unlike the Xavánte (which by then were still largely ‘unpacified’), generally
portrayed as treacherous savages, the Karajá are portrayed in a benign—albeit
condescending—light. In part because of such popular literature, the Karajá occupy, more
than other tribes of the region, a place in the national imaginary. They were even the theme
of a samba enredo of a major Rio de Janeiro samba school, Estácio de Sá (1979), narrating
the exploits of the trickster Kynyxiwe.66. Dialectal differencesIn phonological terms, the Karajá dialects can be divided into two groups, the schwadialects (Southern and Northern Karajá) and the non-schwa dialects (Xambioá and Javaé).
As shown in Table 5 below, corresponding to the schwa in Southern and Northern Karajá,
Xambioá and Javaé generally present a vowel identical with the vowel in the following
syllable. The schwa-dialects also present CrV syllables where Xambioá and Javaé have
CVrV syllables (Table 6). Both facts—the occurrence of the schwa and of CCV syllables—
are probably interconnected, as CCV syllables can be analyzed as the result of schwa
syncope (see Chapter 2).","[26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"
"Lastly, I would like to thank my professors at the University of Chicago, to whom I owe any
merits this dissertation may have. Many of the ideas in this dissertation grew out of classes I
took with Jerry Sadock, Amy Dahlstrom, Michael Silverstein, Salikoko Mufwene, John
Goldsmith, Kostas Kazazis, Anthony Buccini, and Gunnar Hansson, among others. Chicago
provided me with a deeper understanding of the value of theoretical diversity and with a set
of analytic tools which I will forever cherish in my career as a linguist. I was particularly
fortunate to have in my dissertation committee linguists who, while having solid reputations
as theoretical linguists, equally value data-oriented linguistic analysis: Amy Dahlstrom, Jerry
Sadock, and Michael Silverstein. I am particularly indebted to Amy Dahlstrom, not only for
her contributions to my education as a linguist, but also for her kind support and
encouragement, without which this dissertation would not have come to light.viiABBREVIATIONS

INTRODUCTION1. The Iny and their languageThe main purpose of this dissertation is to provide an introductory grammar of Karajá, a
Macro-Jê language spoken along the Araguaia River, in Central Brazil. Karajá has three
mutually-intelligible dialects—Karajá proper, Javaé, and Xambioá. Karajá proper can be
further divided into Northern and Southern Karajá. Combined, the four dialects have a total
of approximately three thousand speakers (Silva 2009), in the Brazilian states of Goiás, Mato
Grosso, Tocantins, and Pará. The dissertation takes into account data of all four dialects,
collected by the author in several field trips. Except for the Xambioá dialect, Karajá is quite
vigorous in sociolinguistic terms, being the first language to be learned by the children and
the language used in everyday life in nearly all of the villages.
Speakers of the four different dialects refer to their people as Iny [i""n´)] ‘people, human’,
and to their language as Iny Rybe [i""n´) rÈ""bE]. Ethnographic naming practices follow in part
the point of view of the Karajá proper, who call their northernmost kin iS´)bIkOwa
‘companion people’ (iS´) ‘people’ + bIkOwa ‘friend, companion’), whence the Portuguese
word Xambioá. Despite their obvious linguistic and cultural communion, the Karajá refer to
the Javaé as iS´)dZu, a term generally reserved for non-Karajá Indians such as the Xavánte.
As we will see (Chapter 2), such attitude has less to do with linguistic differences than with
cultural and historical ones. The Javaé, on the other hand, call the remaining Karajáberohok´) maha)dU ‘the people of the big river [i.e. the Araguaia]’. Non-Indians are called1Îori or, less-commonly, weku or w´l´ (words whose etymologies are unknown).
Bilingualism is very common among the men, who frequently visit the neighboring towns in
order to trade fish and other commodities; some (including entire families) travel even
farther, seeking education or medical treatment.
In this introduction, I provide background information on the language and its
speakers: Section 2 describes the geographic location of the Karajá-speaking tribes; Section 3
discusses the language’s genetic affiliation; Section 4 describes contacts with speakers of
different languages; Section 5 offers a brief appraisal of previous scholarship on Karajá
language and culture; Section 6 describes basic dialectal differences; Section 7 briefly
discusses the circumstances surrounding the collection and elicitation of the data on which
the present dissertation is based. The introduction concludes with a brief grammatical sketch
of the language (Section 8) and a narrative table of contents (Section 9).","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"

crucial also for the analysis of the consonantal system. The allophonic nature of the
variations shown above is missed if the oppositions between /i, È5, u/ and /I, È, U/ are not
recognized.
The study of some morphophonemic alternations also corroborates the analysis
suggested above. Thus, the nominalizer suffix -TV (where V stands for a vowel identical to
the last vowel in the verb root) is palatalized when attached to a verb root ending in the high
front [+ATR] vowel /i/, but not after its [-ATR] counterpart /I/:(21)VerbNoun-aha

36One of the sources of tS in Southern and Northern Karajá is the palatalization of the
velar stop /k/ after the [high, +ATR] vowel /i/, a process that does not occur in Javaé and
Xambioá (23). Again, the high front [-ATR] vowel /I/ does not trigger palatalization: bIkOwa

‘He stopped it.’Palatalization is, thus, clearly a word-internal, lexical rule. It is a fairly useful
indicator of morphological constituency, distinguishing compounds from syntactic phrases
(91), and distinguishing “old” morphology from presumably more recent constructions.
Notice that the prefixes Î- and l- ~ d-, which undergo palatalization, have clear cognates in
Proto-Jê and in other families of the Macro-Jê stock (see Chapter 6), a fact which attests to
their antiquity.406.2.1 Exceptions40In Lexical Phonology terms, prefixes such as Î- ‘3rd person’ and l- ~ d- ‘relational’, as well
as fossilized i-, are reminiscent of “Level 1” affixes in English, such as –ity (in electric-ity),
while prefixes such as d- ‘centripetal direction’ and productive i- ‘3rd person’ would belong
to shallower morphological levels. The fossilized prefix i- probably has the same origin as
the 3rd person marker. Both clearly contrast synchronically, though, as illustrated by the fact
that they can cooccur (cf. idZ´kÈ ‘story’ vs. i-idZ´kÈ ‘his story’). The contrast between both
prefixes is further illustrated below by the root r´d´) ‘feces’ (idZ´d´) ‘feces’ vs. i-r´d´) ‘his

high [+ATR] vowels. There are a few apparent exceptions to this claim, but all of them seem
to find a straightforward explanation. One of the exceptions is the word tSakohi, the name of
a ritual mask, which is clearly a Tupi-Guarani loanword (likely from Tapirapé tSaku/i; cf.
Ribeiro 2002). Another apparent exception is the emphatic particle èSE, which presents a
palatal consonant despite lacking a high [+ATR] vowel. Another phonological peculiarity
involving èSE is the fact that it triggers vowel harmony, although it does not contain a
[+ATR] vowel superficially. Combined, both apparent anomalies shed light on this
morpheme’s apparent exceptionality: èSE would contain a high [+ATR] vowel underlyingly,
*/TiE/, which would account for both facts.","[131, 132, 133]"
"188Such evidential use restrains the range of pragmatic situations in which centripetal
progressive verbs can occur, helping to explain the rarity of such verbs in narrative texts, for example.
Why then are 1st and 2nd person centripetal progressive verbs even harder to come by? Oppositions
between sentences such as ‘I am coming’ vs. ‘I am going’, and ‘I am bringing it’ versus ‘I am taking
it away’ seem to be neutralized, as suggested by examples such as (21a, b) and (22a) below, in which
a progressive verb marked with the centrifugal prefix r- may be interpreted as denoting either a
centrifugal or a centripetal motion:(21)a.ÎaÎErI

"♀[budoewo""ku]‘deer’s stomach’/bUdOE woku/
deer stomachThis distinction has turned out to be crucial for the study of vowel harmony in Karajá
in particular, and of Karajá phonology in general. By recognizing the distinction between lax
and tense (or [-ATR] and [+ATR]) vowels, one can account for a number of otherwise
unexplainable ‘exceptions’ in which a high front or back vowel would ‘fail’ to trigger vowel
harmony. In addition, one is able to provide a consistent account of palatalization, as we will
see.
Vowel harmony languages are characterized by constraints on which vowels may cooccur within a given phonological domain (typically, the phonological word). In Karajá, the
parameter governing these constraints is, as claimed in this work, the feature [ATR]. The
examples below show the patterns of vowel combinations in the phonological word in
Karajá, according to the feature [ATR].",[115]

‘I will go.’
‘Let’s go.’The text fragment in (54), from a traditional tale (of which another, shorter version
was published as Ribeiro 2005a), brilliantly illustrates how the ambiguity of idZoi can be
exploited for comical effects. In the story, the monkey (krObI) kindly offers to take the turtle
(kOÎud¸)) up a jatobá tree so that the latter could eat some fruit. The monkey then
nonchalantly decides to leave the turtle behind, up on the tree. The monkey’s departing
words are (54a), to which the turtle replies with (54b); while the monkey clearly has a firstperson singular meaning in mind, the turtle demands a first-person plural inclusive

The grammaticalization of id´) and idZoi parallels that of Brazilian Portuguese a gente
‘the people’, which is mostly used with 1st person plural conotations (even though, as in
Karajá, the verb displays third-person agreement). Another parallel to the
grammaticalization of idZoi is the evolution of English guys as a 2nd person pronoun44Notice that, in (10b), the verb illustrates a case of assimilation in absentia (cf. Chapter 2): the future markerèkre, although not present, triggers vowel harmony in the preceding [-ATR] vowels.

in English (since you guys can be used to refer to both males and females), was not bleached
in Karajá. As far as my data are concerned, the non-literal, 1st person uses of idZoi are
restricted to male speech.","[219, 220]"

a)Any morpheme containing a [+ATR] vowel can trigger vowel harmony, regardless of
its morphological or stress status. Vowel harmony can be triggered by noun or verb roots,
clitics (such as the locative postposition tSi and the imperfective auxiliary (r)e), and suffixes.
Vowel harmony occurs either morpheme-internally or across word-boundaries, with the
phonological word (characterized by a single primary stress) being its apparent domain. I
will exemplify the behavior of each vowel in relation to vowel harmony by taking verb forms
involving the clitic auxiliary (r)e ‘imperfective.’
The mid open vowels /E/ and /O/ undergo [+ATR] assimilation in an iterative manner.
As shown by examples (11) and (12), vowel harmony is not restricted to the verb root, but
also affects the vowel of the prefix.","[117, 118]"
