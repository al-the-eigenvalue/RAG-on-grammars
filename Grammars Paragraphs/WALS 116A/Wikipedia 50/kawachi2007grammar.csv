the other speaker has said and to answer a question affirmatively (in each of the two sets
of conversations in (3.503) and (3.504), the person B can answer the person A’s question
by saying ee.).
The word for ‘no’ is used to negate what the other speaker has said, as in (3.503).","[329, 330]"

construction constitute a single clause cannot be answered here, though whether or not
Sidaama shows the V-language pattern depends partly on what types of constructions it
uses for events. The descriptions in 6.2.3-6.2.7 mainly focused on where more schematic
and less schematic event components are morphosyntactically expressed. Nevertheless,
the following two types of uses of the temporal sequence construction are excluded from
the discussion, because the event components do not seem to be packaged densely
enough to be treated as macro-events. One type is a case where the two verbs can be
modified by different temporal adverbials, as in (6.47) and (6.48).12(6.47) bero

there are those verb suffixes whose final vowel segments are always accented (or which
constitute the final vowel segments of words by themselves and are always accented).
Such suffixes include: simple perfect (3SG.M: -i, 3SG.F/3PL: -u, 2PL: -i), present perfect
(3: -ino, 2PL: -oonni), imperfect (3: -anno, 2PL: -anni), and connective (-e: all
persons/numbers/genders) suffixes (Hudson 1976: 248). Thus, a verb with the third
person singular simple perfect suffix contrasts with a verb with the second-person
singular imperative suffix, as in (2.52) and (2.53), and a verb with the third-person
singular present-perfect suffix contrasts with a verb with the first-person plural
imperative suffix, as in (2.54) and (2.55).(2.52) ha’r-ø-i.

[sit-IMP.1PL]‘He sat down.’
‘Let us sit down.’2.3.3 Intonation
Intonation toward the end of a sentence differentiates sentence types in Sidaama.
A Sidaama sentence normally ends in a suffixed verb or the predicating noun-phrase
clitic (=ho/=te or =ti). Non-WH-questions are usually only indicated by an intonation
pattern in the final or semi-final word of a sentence different from that in its declarative
counterpart (Greenberg 1963: universal 8).
In a declarative sentence ending in a suffixed verb, high pitch occurs on the
second to the last vowel segment of the word-final, main verb, and the pitch falls down at
its final vowel segment, which has low pitch, as long as the suffix has penultimate high
pitch accent.(2.56) ani

‘I (M) did not sleep.’However, as mentioned in section 2.3.2, the final vowel segment, rather than the
penultimate vowel segment, of the main verb of a declarative sentence has high pitch
when the main verb root is followed by one of the following suffixes: simple perfect
(3SG.M, 3SG.F/3PL, 2PL), present perfect (3SG.M, 3SG.F/3PL, 2PL), imperfect
(3SG.M, 3SG.F/3PL, 2PL), and connective (all persons/numbers/genders) suffixes. In

their declarative counterparts. The very high pitch on the penultimate vowel segment of
the sentence-final word is followed by its fall at its final vowel segment in the case of
penultimate-accented suffixes, whereas the very high pitch remains high at the end of the
sentence-final word in the case of final-vowel-accented suffixes.(2.61) ani

- 74 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 2: Phonology 752.3.4 Pause
Sidaama often uses pauses to indicate constituent boundaries. When the sentence
has SOV word order, a pause usually occurs between the constituent boundaries (Teferra
2000: 16-17), as in (2.73). (In the examples in this section, pauses are indicated with //.)(2.73) bule

Bule(NOM.F)sunk’-i-t-u.
kiss-EP-3SG.F-S.PRF.3SG.FThe constituent structure of a transcribed sentence can differ depending on the location of
a pause, especially because some case forms are morphologically identical (specifically,
the nominative and the accusative of a feminine noun, the genitive and dative/locative of
an unmodified feminine common noun, and the genitive and nominative of a masculine
noun) and the person/number/gender of the subject can be indicated by the verb suffix
alone, rather than the subject being expressed as independent nouns or pronouns. For
example, each pair of sentences in (2.75) and (2.76), which look morphologically
identical, differ in the locations where pauses as well as high pitch accents are placed.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]"
"4For example, it is not clear whether external possessor constructions, which seem to be characteristic of
Sidaama (Chapter 5 section 5.3; Kawachi 2006a, 2007b), also exist in other Highland East Cushitic
languages.
5Omotic languages are usually treated as constituting an independent branch of the Afro-Asiatic phylum
(Fleming 1969, 1976, Fleming and Bender 1976), but there are researchers who question their status. For
example, Lamberti (1991) claims that Omotic languages belong to the Cushitic family, based on their
morphological similarities.",[25]

5.4 Relative Clauses
The present section discusses relative clauses (RCs) in Sidaama. It first describes
their structures briefly in section 5.4, and then addresses the question of what types of
elements can be relativized in this language in sections 5.4.2-5.4.4.","[637, 638]"

publications include Tekleselassie (2002, 2005, 2006), Tekleselassie and Johnstone
(2004), and Alemu and Tekleselassie (2006).
I have had consultation sessions with Abebayehu regularly (usually 2-6 hours a
week, sometimes longer or shorter) to collect Sidaama data. The consultations have been
conducted in English. We usually met in my office at the University at Buffalo, but,
since the late summer of 2005, when he left Buffalo, consultations have been done by
phone.
Admittedly, the use of a single consultant for a grammatical description cannot
take into account idiolectal or dialectal differences. Nevertheless, even when multiple
consultants on a language are employed, it would be difficult to ask all of them exactly
the same set of questions to write a grammar of the language; a bias toward the judgment
of even a small number of linguistic forms by a certain speaker or speakers out of a group
of consultants would be inevitable. The consultation with a single speaker makes it easy
to obtain consistent data. In order to benefit from this strength, I checked almost all the
examples in this dissertation with Abebayehu at least twice.","[46, 47]"

There are several forms of suffixes that turn verbs into nouns (Chapter 3 section
3.1.2.3), namely, -a, -o, -e, -ans o , -atto, -ano, -ille, -imma, and -aanco. Because the
- 314 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 315citation form of any word in Sidaama ends in -a, -o, or -e, it is sometimes difficult to
decide whether nouns ending in one of these vowels derive from verbs by adding a
nominalizing suffix to the verb stem, or the verbs derive from the nouns. Examples are
shown in (4.5).3(4.5)verbnoun-aurd- ‘to knot’

sibling=NPC.PRED.MODIt should be noted that the use of adjectives like nouns is different from the use of
adjectives as nouns. In Sidaama, the noun modified by an adjective can sometimes be
omitted.33 In this case, the adjective modifying the omitted noun looks as if it were
serving as an argument. This happens when the referent of the omitted noun is
understood by the conversation participants to be a particular entity. It also happens
when the referent is compared to another entity that belongs to the category of the
omitted noun that has a property different from the one expressed by the adjective. For33Dryer (2004) points out that there are two types of cases where noun phrases without nouns (or
pronouns) (i.e., those consisting of elements that would otherwise be optional modifiers of “head” nouns)
are likely to be used: (i) “when the speaker does not know what kind of thing the thing that they are
referring to is” and (ii) “when the kind will be so obvious to the hearer that it can be left out” (p.70). Dryer
argues that in the case of (i), nouns do not have a privileged status in noun phrases, and proposes that all
noun phrases are headless; he questions the ‘head’ of an NP as a universal notion. On the other hand,
according to him, in the case of (ii), ellipsis of the noun is likely to be involved.
The use of noun phrases in Sidaama that do not contain nouns, as in (3.145) and (3.146), is an
example of the latter case. Such noun phrases in Sidaama can occur only when the hearer knows what the
ellipsed noun is.","[175, 176]"
"In the first pattern exemplified by (6.136b), the realization of the framing event (the
hubcap’s state-change of becoming flat) is beyond the scope of the intention of the agent
expressed by the verb kicked, as in (6.136a). This is a type of state-change event where
the co-event is in a support relation of Cause to the framing event. In the second type
illustrated in (6.137), the agent’s goal of realizing the event in (6.137b) (capturing the
fugitive) is included in the event expressed only by the verb, as in (6.137a), but the use of
the verb hunted alone in (6.137a) is neutral as to whether the goal has been attained. In
the third pattern, which is shown in (6.138), the verb washed implies the fulfillment of
the agent’s goal of cleansing the shirt, as in (6.138a), but the fulfillment can be- 774 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 775confirmed, as in (6.138b). Finally, as in (6.139), the verb drowned asserts that the
agent’s goal of killing him has been attained, and no other element further confirms it.
The question here is how a language expresses the fulfillment of the goal that the
agent intends to attain, or the confirmation of the fulfillment of the agent’s goal that is
only implicated, as in (6.137) and (6.138). In S-languages, it is characteristically done by
the use of a satellite, whereas in V-languages, the main verb of a multi-verb construction
is used. Sidaama basically follows the latter pattern. The ways that Sidaama expresses
this event type are discussed below.
In (6.140), the predicate only implicates the agent’s intention of killing him, but
does not entail its fulfillment.3434The realization of a state-change also follows the same pattern as the fulfillment of the agent’s goal. In
(i), the predicate does not entail the confirmation of the result of his state-change of drowning.

"3.2.2.1 Noun-Phrase Clitic: =ta/=ha/=re
Sidaama has two types of clitics that form NPs with constituents that modify them
(in other words, that might be analyzed as the heads of NPs). One type is discussed in
this section, and the other type is discussed in the next section.57
The type of noun-phrase clitic (NPC) dealt with here has the following accusative
forms: =ta (F)/=ha (M)/=re (PL) (its other case forms are discussed shortly). It has three
uses (i)-(iii) in Table 3.17, each of which are illustrated with the examples in (3.336)-57An alternative analysis of the first type of NPC may be that it is a nominalizer that turns an open
sentence into an NP and a sentence into a CP. However, when it attaches to an adjective or a non-genitive
NP, it cannot form an argument NP, though it can form a predicate.",[260]

‘Spacious houses are expensive.’ (lit., ‘Wide houses are expensive.’)A limited number of adjectives have pairs of forms that are contrastive in gender,
namely masculine forms and feminine forms. As a rule, the choice of the form depends
on the gender of the subject noun in the case of a predicative adjective and on the gender
of the modified noun in the case of an attributive adjective. Some adjectives that have
the gender distinction are listed in (3.127). The two pairs of contrastive suffix forms,
-(aal)eette (F)/-(aal)eessa (M) and -(aall)itte (F)/-(aall)icca (M), also occur in some
pairs of feminine and masculine nouns (e.g., lakk-itte (F)/lakk-icca (M) ‘twin’; see
Chapter 4 section 4.2.1.1; as seen shortly, many words with these suffixes cannot be
classified into adjectives or nouns), but the contrast in terms of -(aam)e (F)/-(aam)o (M)
is restricted to adjectives.",[167]

Examples of idiomatic expressions with y- and ass- are shown in (3.191a) and
(3.191b) below, respectively. As in the above examples, expressions with y- and ass- are
often paired with each other and show contrast in causativity (y-versions: non-causative
vs. ass-versions: causative), though there are a small number of y- expressions that have
no ass- counterparts (e.g., araji y- ‘to become bored’, leessi y- ‘to become dusk’). The
preceding form usually ends in i, as in (3.191), and there are some expressions that
contain reduplicated forms, as in (3.192). There are various meanings that such idiomatic
expressions with y- and ass- tend to convey: posture change, self-contained motion,
emotion, etc., though such meanings do not necessarily require expressions with y- and
ass- to be used.","[195, 196, 197]"

"There are almost noambitransitive verbs like the English verb break that can be both.19 As shown in (3.68),
Sidaama has a limited number of intransitive-transitive pairs of morphologically
unrelated lexical verbs that seem to show a semantic contrast, but it is not clear whether
they are contrastive only with respect to causativity.(3.68) intransitive

(3.69). First, there are a large number of intransitive verb roots whose causative forms
are transitive verbs (Chapter 4 section 4.2.1.3.2). Second, the passive form of a transitive
verb root acts as an intransitive verb that expresses a state-change (Chapter 4 section
4.2.1.3.3). Third, there are many pairs of idiomatic expressions with ass- ‘to do’ and y‘to say’ that show a transitivity contrast (see section 3.1.5 for more details).",[137]
"1.2 Literature Review
In general, only a small number of studies on Sidaama have been written in
English, and not much information on this language is available in English.15 This
section lists previous studies on Sidaama and other HEC languages.
There is a grammar of Sidaama written by Teferra (2000). As far as I know, this
is the only grammar written in English. However, it lacks sufficient examples, and fails
to discuss important aspects of Sidaama grammar.
Hudson (1976), who provides a short description of Highland East Cushitic
languages, sketches some aspects of Sidaama.
There are a few dictionaries of Sidaama and the HEC languages. Gasparini
(1983) is a Sidaama-English dictionary, which contains some example sentences and
socio-cultural notes. Hudson’s (1989) HEC dictionary contains a Sidaama-English
dictionary chapter and an English-HEC dictionary chapter, though it does not have any
sentence examples.
There are also some descriptions of the phonology (Leslau 1952, 1959, Wedekind
1980, Teferra 1994, 2002) and morphophonemics (Abebe Gebre-Tsadik 1985) of

ful-/fuss-, dirr-/dirr-i-s-, e’-/ee-s-, sa’-/sa-i-s-.20
Sidaama Path verbs can also be classified differently, according to the Vector
component of the path that they can express, as in (6.64).21(6.64) (i) Path verbs that are compatible with TO/FROM
ful- ‘to exit, move out; ascend’
hi- ‘to return’
sikk’i y- ‘to approach’
da- ‘to come’
ha- ‘to leave, go’
mar- ‘to go (to a (usually, known)
destination)’
dirr- ‘to descend’
sorr- ‘to chase away’
fuss- ‘to take out’
abb- ‘to bring’
dirr-i-s- ‘to move down’
mass- ‘to take (away)’
a- ‘to take’
haa- ‘to take, carry away’
k’ol- ‘to turn, return’
(ii) Path verbs that are compatible with TO (but use AT expressions for the goal
of a motion)
e’- ‘to enter’
ee-ss- ‘to put in’
wor- ‘to put’
surk- ‘to slide in’
iill- ‘to arrive’20Note that the glottal stop, which is included in non-agentive/self-agentive verbs, e’- and sa’-, does not
occur in their agentive counterparts.
Note also that there are a few other pairs of verbs contrasting in agentivity.
(i)non-agentive/self-agentive
(a) do- ‘to move around; rotate’
(b) ta’- ‘(of something made of soft material) to become torn apart’
(c) ka’- ‘to rise, get up’agentive
do-i-s- to surround’
ta-i-s- ‘to cross’
ka-i-s- ‘to lift up’However, unlike the non-agentive/self-agentive form of (ia), its agentive form is not a translational motion
verb but a self-contained motion verb. On the other hand, unlike the agentive forms of (ib) and (ic), their
non-agentive/self-agentive forms are self-contained motion verbs rather than translational motion verbs.
21A fuller characterization of motion verbs in a particular language needs to test them for their patterns of
occurrence with temporal expressions, for example, by means of Talmy’s Motion-aspect Formulas (Talmy
2000a: 215-216, 2000bL 53-56), but this is beyond the scope of the present study.","[754, 755]"

Professor Jürgen BohnemeyeriiiDedicated to my family,
especially my wife and childrenivAck nowled gmentsFirst of all, I would like to express my deepest thanks to Dr. Abebayehu Aemero
Tekleselassie (PhD in educational administration), my Sidaama native speaker consultant
and teacher (from the Baansa district of the Sidaama zone in Southern Ethiopia), who has
provided me with data constantly over the years. He and I have had approximately one
thousand hours of consultation sessions so far. I owe most parts of my dissertation to his
friendship, his encouragement, and his patience as well as his Sidaama data and his
insightful comments on them. If I had not met him at the party for the Field Methods
class in Buffalo in 2001, I would not be able to be working on Sidaama, nor would I have
been able to write this dissertation.
Before I started to study Sidaama, I had worked on several different languages
(excluding English and Japanese) with their native speakers, hoping that I might be
inspired enough by one of those languages to write a dissertation. However, for various
reasons unique to each language, I could not continue to work on any one of them long
enough to generate a dissertation topic. After repeating the mistake of studying a
language halfway and saying good-bye to its speaker(s) several times, I was at a loss for
what to do for dissertation research. At that time, Dr. Abebayehu rescued me from
abandoning the idea of working on a language other than English and Japanese, by giving
me the chance to study Sidaama.
I am lucky enough to have been able to work closely with a person like Dr.
Abebayehu for a long time. He and I were only two floors away in the same building for
several years. He has always been cooperative, letting me ask him about Sidaama notvonly in my office and in our houses, but anywhere, including for example, at Tops
Supermarket at University Plaza, in my car, at the Buffalo Airport, and in one of the
surgery waiting rooms at Kenmore Mercy Hospital, he is always willing to make time for
my questions. He is very tough, and we have usually had a couple of two-hour sessions a
week, sometimes even a several hours’ session in a day. I don’t know how I can thank
him.
I would also like to express my profound thanks to my advisors for their
mentorship. I am very much honored to have been able to be one of their students. My
primary advisor, Professor Matthew S. Dryer, constantly gave me professional comments
and advice on my dissertation. Without him, I would never have been able to complete
my dissertation so fast. Professor Leonard Talmy gave me much advice and insightful
comments on my work over the long years. His every word has always executed a great
influence on me. I would also like to convey my sincere thanks to Professor Jürgen
Bohnemeyer for his constructively critical, detailed written comments and very
encouraging verbal comments on this study.
My gratitude goes to other professors in the Department of Linguistics at the
University at Buffalo for training me as a linguist, especially, Professor Karin Michelson
(who helped me decide on writing on Sidaama), Professor Jean-Pierre Koenig (who
always gave me encouraging advice), Professor Jeri Jaeger (who taught me basic
linguistic analyses and academic writing), Professor Wolfgang Wölck (who gave me
words of cheer and various delicious drinks), Professor David Zubin, Professor Robert
Van Valin, Professor Mitsuaki Shimojo, Professor Roger Woodard, and Professor
Colleen Fitzgerald. I would also like to mention that I gained tremendous benefit fromvithe Field Methods classes, which I took for three years straight here in Buffalo, and
learned very useful fundamental techniques of the elicitation of linguistic data from
Professor Karin Michelson, Professor Matthew S. Dryer, and Professor Colleen
Fitzgerald.
My special thanks go to Professor Norimitsu Tosu, my former advisor at Keio
University, for his continuous encouragement. If I had not studied linguistics under his
instruction, I would not be pursuing this discipline now. I am also indebted to Mr.
Makoto Ebihara, my ex-teacher at Keio Boys’ Senior High School, for directing my
interest to linguistic investigation in my younger days.
There are also many colleagues of mine who I would like to thank. First, Justin
Boffemmyer has read my entire dissertation and given me numerous helpful comments. I
would also like to express my thanks to my officemates, Valeria Belloro, Christopher
Phipps, and Rodrigo Romero-Mendez, for various discussions, and to my other
colleagues who gave linguistic and/or editorial comments on or who had discussion with
me about portions of my dissertation, especially, Justin Boffemmyer, Jerry Bove, Jennifer
Cornish, Ed Escott, Lilian Guerrero, Paul Heider, Sang-gu Kang, Heike Lehnert
LeHouillier, Atsuko Nishiyama, Luis Paris, Yukiko Sugiyama, Khaled Albahri, Yongeun
Lee (Northwestern), and Ichiro Yuhara (Chicago) (their titles are omitted).
My gratitude also goes to Carole Orsolits (Linguistics Department) and Heike
Jones (Center for Cognitive Science) for providing office space to work out of. I have
been able to collect data very efficiently thanks to this space.viiThanks also go to the Mark Diamond Research Fund, the College of Arts and
Sciences dissertation fellowship, and the Department of Linguistics summer research
grants at the University at Buffalo for partial support of the present study.
Saving the most important for last, I would like to convey many thanks to my
family, especially, my wife, children, and parents, for their support and patience. I
apologize for all the great inconvenience that I have caused (and am still causing) to them
because of the studies that I have been conducting over such a long period of time
without sparing much or any time for them and without earning any income. I will do my
best to compensate for this after I go back home.
Finally, please let me make an excuse. I would like the reader to be generous
enough to take my dissertation as a rough draft of my improved future work. Even
though my consultant is superb, I might have made some errors. Also, even though my
brilliant advisors have given me helpful advice, there are many portions that I have not
been able to revise. I have to submit this as my dissertation to the Graduate School now,
because of the deadline (coming in a few minutes!) set by a newly created rule. I hope
that I will be able to revise it as soon as possible. Maganu oohe! in advance again, Dr.
Abebayehu!viiiTab le of Conten ts

East Cushitic language spoken in the south-central part of Ethiopia. Sidaama is spoken
by over 1,800,000 people, but there has been relatively little research on the language.
Chapter 1 (introduction) gives background information on the Sidaama language
and the Sidaama people, briefly reviews previous studies, and discusses the methodology
used in the present study.
Chapters 2-5 use basic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, Dryer 2006) to describe
the phonology and morphosyntax of Sidaama, and Chapter 6 examines the event
integration patterns (Talmy 1991, 2000b) as one property of semantic structuring in this
language.
Chapter 2 (phonology) lists the phonemes, the consonant clusters, and the
geminates, describes suprasegmentals (syllables and moras, pitch accent, intonation, and
pause), and presents morphophonemic rules.
Chapter 3 (parts of speech) describes characteristics of parts of speech. The
topics discussed in this chapter include types of nouns and verbs, similarities between
adjectives and nouns and between adjectives and verbs, various pronominal forms, and
clitics.
Chapter 4 (morphology) discusses reduplication of verb roots, suprafixes on
nouns and adjectives, and suffixes on nouns, adjectives, and verbs. It also examines the
ordering relationship of the suffixes.xviiChapter 5 (syntax) discusses four topics on the syntax of Sidaama. The first
section looks into grammatical relations in terms of how they are coded and in what
constructions they occur. The second topic of Chapter 5 is word order. The third section
of Chapter 5 discusses two types of external possessor construction, the oblique
possessum external possessor construction and the dative possessor external possessor
construction. The fourth section examines the structures of relative clauses and the types
of elements that can be relativized.
Chapter 6 (semantics) examines the semantic structure of Sidaama, which shows
characteristics of a verb-framed language, in terms of how it expresses different types of
events, using Talmy’s (1985, 1991, 2000b) typological framework of event integration.
It investigates how the schematic and the non-schematic components of the five types of
events (motion, state change, realization, temporal contouring, and action correlating)
appear morphosyntactically in this language.xviiiAbb reviat ions

grammatical structure of Sidaama, a Cushitic language of Ethiopia. Chapters 2-5 use
basic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, Dryer 2006) to describe the phonology and
morphosyntax of Sidaama, and Chapter 6 examines the event integration patterns (Talmy
1991, 2000b) as one property of semantic structuring in this language.
This chapter is organized as follows.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

In expressing the events of temporal contouring (aspect), which has a wide variety
of subtypes, Sidaama shows the V-language pattern to some extent, but often deviates
from the V-language pattern.
According to Talmy (2000b), the framing event of temporal contouring has one of
the following two types of structures. First, in aspectual types such as “starting”,
- 780 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 781“stopping”, “continuing”, “remaining manifested”, “iterating”, “intensifying”, and
“tapering off”, the figure is the degree of manifestation of an event, namely whether or
not an event is manifested, and if manifested, how it is manifested, and the ground is a
particular point in time or a period of time. For example, in the English example (6.17)
They talked on, the figure is the full manifestation of the event, the ground is an
unspecified period of time, the core schema is continuation, and the co-event is their
talking.
On the other hand, in the aspectual type of “finishing”, the figure is an affected
object and the ground is temporal contour. The core schema consists of the ground and
the association function, the latter of which is the direction of the relation between the
figure and the ground. For example, in the English sentence I wrote the letter to
completion, where the figure, the letter, is affected in a way that it is agentively “moved”
to completion with the co-event of me writing, and the core schema is made up of a
positive direction of association (the Vector TO) and a terminative temporal contour.
Whichever of the structures the framing event may have, the support relation that
the co-event has in relation to the framing event is “a constitutive relation, in effect
“filling in” the conceptual region outlined by the temporal contour” (Talmy 2000b: 232).
Like other event types, temporal contouring is expressed differently in Vlanguages and S-languages. For the framing event of temporal contouring, V-languages
characteristically use the main verb of a construction and S-languages a satellite (or an
adpositional phrase), though S-languages may also have lexical verbs for temporal
contouring (e.g., English: begin, end, continue, repeat, finish) (Talmy 2000b: 232).","[801, 802]"

Like the AT forms of the two sets of demonstrative pronouns discussed earlier,
the adnominal demonstratives for masculine nouns can be used in a relative clause with
the existential verb, regardless of the gender and the number of the noun that they
modify, as in (3.243)-(3.246).","[228, 229]"

or NP predicates (with noun-phrase clitics), as in (3.436c)-(3.436i). The clitic di=
attaches to clause-final constituents, as in (3.436a), (3.436c), and (3.436e)-(3.436i), or to
preverbal constituents, as in (3.436b) and (3.436d). Each type is discussed with examples
below. In this language, focus is placed on a preverbal constituent. As indicated in the
glosses for some of the examples of (3.436b) and (3.436d), when di= attaches to a
preverbal constituent, the constituent is contrasted to other constituents that (potentially)
stand in a paradigmatic relation with it.• di=verb: (3.436a)
When used as a predicate, any verb in the present perfect, imperfect, progressive,
or continuous aspect, can be negated by di=, which immediately precedes it, as in
(3.437)-(3.442).78
78When this clitic is attached to a verb, the verb has to be in the present perfect, imperfect, progressive, or
continuous aspect, and cannot be in the simple perfect. When the progressive form of a verb, “V-PERSINF-INST exist” (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3.1), is negated with the clitic di=, it occurs immediately before
the content verb, as in (ia), rather than immediately before the existential verb, as in (ib).",[308]

The negation test reveals the ambiguity of a sentence like (6.29) (repeated below
as (6.36)), which could be taken as an instance of the manner/concomitance construction
or the temporal inclusion construction. The main verb of (6.29) (e’- ‘to enter’) is negated
in (6.37). When (6.37) is interpreted as an instance of the manner/concomitance
construction, as in (6.37-1), the occurrences of the event components expressed by the
two verbs are both negated. On the other hand, when (6.37) is interpreted as an instance
of the temporal inclusion construction, as in (6.37-2), only the occurrence of the event
component expressed by V2 is negated.(6.36) kaase

(The ball neither rolled nor entered the house.)
‘While the ball was rolling, it did not enter the house.’The negation test does not seem to be a reliable test for the clause-hood of the
verbs in the temporal sequence V1-V2 construction with the connective suffix -e. In
most cases, the negation of V2 has scope over both of the event components, as in (6.381)-(6.44-1). Nevertheless, a difference usually emerges in an alternative interpretation
depending on whether or not the V1 of this construction is a Manner verb. When V1
expresses a Manner of the translational motion of the V2 in this construction, the
negation of V2 can often also be interpreted as resulting in the negation of only the
Manner, as shown in (6.38-2) and (6.39-2).10 On the other hand, when the V1 of the9However, another possible interpretation of (6.37) is the negation of the first event component: ‘The ball
entered the house not in the manner of rolling (but in some other manner)’.
10(6.38) and (6.39) as used for (6.38-2) and (6.39-2) are approximately the same as (i) and (ii) below,
respectively, which use the simple perfect form of V1 and the negative suffix before the suffix -nni

there are cases where the above generalization does not work. For example, there are
cases like (6.45) where the negation of V2 in a temporal sequence construction using a

In fast speech, when the negative proclitic di= (Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.4)
immediately precedes a clause-final predicative or preverbal constituent beginning in a
vowel, the /i/ of the clitic is optionally dropped, and when this clitic precedes a verb
beginning in /h/, the /h/ as well as the /i/ of the clitic is dropped (Teferra 2000: 26-27). In
these cases, the vowel right after the reduced clitic d= bears a high pitch. (2.30) shows
examples where this clitic and verbs are fused.","[75, 76, 77]"

• Interrogative words in the predicate or pre-predicate position
Sidaama interrogative words (Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.7), which can be pronouns,
adnominals, or adverbs, are sensitive to information structure, and occur most commonly
either in the predicate position or in the immediately pre-predicate position, though they
could also be analyzed as remaning in situ.
Generally, a constituent in the predicate position followed by the predicate form
of the noun-phrase clitic (Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.1) provides new information. For
example, in (5.86) and (5.87), danura and hakko manco (or only hakko, depending on
the context) convey new information, respectively.","[544, 545]"

"4.2.2.1.2 Gender Suffixes on Nouns

(feminine). The former pair is often used also to derive nouns or adjectives from verbs
(sections 4.2.1.1.1 and 4.2.1.2), and the latter is used to derive nouns from various parts
of speech. The latter are a pair of allomorphs of the singular suffix – some pairs have
both number-neutral forms and plural forms (e.g., UM: k’osorro, PL: k’osorr-oota
‘[name of a bird]’). Examples are shown in (4.72).","[371, 372]"

"(Talmy 2000b: 30)(Talmy 2000b: 217)- 688 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 689In (6.1a), the ball’s going down the hill and the ball’s rolling are expressed in two
different clauses; the relation between the two is determined by the so-called “present
participle” construction. In (6.1b), almost the same content as (6.1a) is expressed as a
unitary event in a single clause, where the verb rolled expresses the Manner of motion
and the prepositional phrase the path of motion as well as the ground object. In (6.2a),
the candle’s going out is expressed in a separate clause from something blowing on the
candle, and the relation between the two is indicated by the construction with the
conjunction because, which connects the two clauses. (6.2b), on the other hand, treats
approximately the same content as unitary, and expresses it with a single clause, where
the verb expresses the Cause of the state-change event and the satellite the final state
resulting from the state-change.
Like other researchers, Talmy notes structural similarities between motion events
and state-change events, but from a rather different perspective. Talmy (1991, 2000b)
uses the term “macro-event” to refer to an event like (6.1) and (6.2), namely “a complex
event that can be conceptually integrated into a unitary event expressable in some
languages by a single clause” (Talmy 2000b: 220). Although languages can differ as to
what can be conceptualized as single events and expressed in a single clause, there is a
class of events that tend to be recurrently conceptualized as macro-events and expressed
in single clauses across languages.
In both types of events, motion and state-change, the macro-event is made up of a
framing event (a main event), a co-event (a subordinate event), and the supporting
relation. In (6.1), the framing event is the ball’s motion of going down the hill, the coevent is the ball’s rolling, and the supporting relation is a Manner of motion in which the
- 689 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 690ball changes its location. In (6.2), the framing event is the candle’s state-change of going
out, the co-event is something blowing on the candle, and the supporting relation is a
causal relation in which something blowing on the candle causes it to go out.
The framing event, which is the main event of a macro-event, constitutes the
schematic core of the macro-event, and has a framing function relative to the macroevent. It “provides for the whole macro-event the overarching conceptual framework or
reference frame within which the other included activities are conceived of as taking
place”, and represents “the upshot – relative to the whole macro-event” in the sense that
“it is the framing event that is asserted in a positive declarative sentence, that is denied
under negation, that is demanded in an imperative, and that is asked about in an
interrogative”; moreover, it determines the overall temporal and spatial frameworks, the
argument structure, and the syntactic complement structure (Talmy 2000b: 219).
The framing event consists of the following four components: (i) a figural entity,
(ii) a ground entity, (iii) an activation process, and (iv) an association function. The
figural entity is an entity that has an unknown particular value to be determined and to
which attention is directed. The ground entity is a reference-point entity with respect to
which the figural entity is characterized. The activation process, which has two values,
transition and fixity, determines the dynamism of the event. In the case of a motion
event, the two values are motion and locatedness (stationariness), and in the case of a
state-change event, they are a change in a property of an entity and a stasis in the
property. The association function, which relates a figural entity to a ground entity,
constitutes the core schema of the framing event (sometimes together with the ground).
For example, in (6.1b) (repeated below as (6.3) with the hill in parentheses), the figural
- 690 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 691entity is the ball, the ground entity is the hill, the activation process is transition,
specifically motion, and the association function is the path along which the ball moves.
In (6.2b) (repeated below as (6.4)), the figural entity is the candle, the ground entity is the
candle’s property of being extinguished, the activation process is transition, specifically
change, and the association function is entry into a new state.","[709, 710, 711, 712]"

bittenAn EPC is used not to express possession directly (for example, with a predicate of
possession or of location, or by means of morphological marking on the possessor or
possessum noun), but two of the participating entities in the EPC are understood to be in
a possessive relation. On the other hand, in internal possessor constructions (IPCs), the
possessor is expressed internally to the NP whose head is the possessum (i.e., the
possessor NP is a dependent of the possessum) and possession is commonly specified, for
example, by the genitive case of the possessor or by a possessive affix on the possessum
noun.
In some languages, possessive relations within NPs (IPCs) are marked differently
depending on whether the possession is alienable (“roughly, ownership, socially and
economically conferred”) or inalienable (“inborn, inherent, not conferred by purchase”)
(Nichols 1988: 568) (inalienability distinction, henceforth). Haiman (1985) proposes a
universal hierarchy of inalienability (kinsmen or body parts > artifacts), on which
different languages set their own cutoff points. Nichols (1986, 1988) also claims that
lexically marked, inalienably possessed nouns form a closed set, in accordance with an
implicational hierarchy similar to the one that Haiman proposes (kin terms and/or body
parts > part-whole and/or spatial relations > culturally basic possessed items). It has
often been assumed that EPCs have a preference for inalienable over alienable possession
and that EPCs can show contrast to their IPC counterparts with regard to inalienability,
which fits into a universal hierarchy (similar to the ones that Haiman and Nichols propose- 534 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 5: Syntax 535for the inalienability distinction within NPs) (e.g., Chappell and McGregor 1996, Payne
and Barshi 1999). For example, Payne and Barshi (1999) propose the following
hierarchy for the types of possessum nouns used in EPCs on which EPCs in different
languages have different cutoff points: body part > part-whole > other inalienable >
alienable+proximate > distal+non-possessable. However, there is no reason to be able to
take it for granted that inalienability as a criterion for lexical classification of nouns
applies to the difference between EPCs and their IPC counterparts (Mithun 1996, 2001,
Kawachi 2006). In Sidaama, the EPCs and the IPC are not necessarily in contrast with
each other (though they may be presented below as if they were). Possession is
specicifed within the IPC by means of possessive marking, but in the case of the EPCs,
possession is inferred from the construction. They use very different mechanisms.
The rest of the present section on EPCs is organized as follows. Section 5.3.1 is
an overview of the two types of Sidaama EPCs. It first provides evidence for the
treatment of these constructions as EPCs (section 5.3.1.1), and gives examples of their
different construction patterns (section 5.3.1.2). It then discusses differences between the
two types of EPCs (section 5.3.1.3), and describes their characteristics (5.3.1.4). Sections
5.3.2 and 5.3.3 focus on the Oblique EPC and the Dative EPC, respectively, and describe
their characteristics by comparing them with other types of constructions.","[554, 555, 556]"

———Singular and plural forms of common nouns are clearly marked with the singular
and plural suffixes. A problem arises with the treatment of unmarked forms, specifically
whether or not the ending vowel of an unmarked form should be regarded as a suffix. All
unmarked forms normally end in -a, -e, or -o, and could be treated as a suffix, like three
of the allomorphs of the nominalizing suffix that attaches to a verb root (section
4.2.1.1.1). However, the citation form of any noun ends in one of these vowels in
Sidaama. Because there is no clear evidence for or against the treatment of the ending of
an unmarked form as a suffix, the present study arbitrarily excludes it from the discussion- 345 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 346of morphological markings of number on common nouns, and focuses on the markings of
nouns with a morpheme that is clearly the singular or plural suffix.
The singular suffix has several allomorphs. As discussed in Chapter 3 (section
3.1.3.1), many of those words referring to a person’s property or ability or a person with
that property or ability can have uses both as adjectives and as nouns. Most of them end
in one of the following suffix forms that derive adjectives or nouns from verbs and that
express singularity (and one of the genders): -aanco, -(aal)eessa (M)/-(aal)eette (F), or
-(aall)icca (M)/-(aall)itte (F). Thus, these are not exclusive to nouns, but are shared with
adjectives.
For two of the allomorphs of the singular suffix, there are phonological conditions
on where they can occur.15(4.68) -co:stem ending in a single occurrence of a sonorant (/n/, /l/, or /r/, in
particular) (which is immediately preceded by a vowel)
siwiil-co ‘a piece of iron’
da’mul-co ‘worm’
daraar-co ‘flower’
man-co ‘person’ (PL: manna)
daun-co ‘leopard’ (PL: daunna)atar-co ‘pea’
danan-co ‘hair’
maal-co ‘a piece/slice of meat’
kin-co ‘stone’ (PL: kinna)
k’oon-co ‘pumpkin’ (PL: k’oonna)Teferra (2000: 35) proposes that in some nouns that contain /-cc/, ‘the first /-c/ is not part of the
singulative but is rather a result of regressive assimilation (spreading) of the singulative /-c/ to the stem
final consonant’ (e.g., stem: /iwiib-/ SG: iwiicco, PL: iwiiw-e ‘lice’, stem: /daub-/ SG: daucco, PL:
dauw-a ‘cedar’, stem: /awaad-/ SG: awacco, PL: awaad-o ‘tanner’). However, as seen shortly, some
nouns with such plural endings may not have singular forms (e.g., UM: t’ilte, PL: t’ilt-uwa ‘waasa
container’). Teferra (2000: 36) also applies this analysis to two more allomorphs of the singular suffix,
-asso and -akko, which contrast with -ado/-adda/-udda and -ahe, respectively (also Moreno 1940: 80)
(e.g., stem: /hamas-/ SG: hamasso, PL: hamas-o ‘snake’, stem: /farad-/ SG: farasso, PL: farado ‘horse’,
stem: /futak-/ SG: futakko, PL: futah-e ‘mole’, stem: /yemak-/ SG: yemakko, PL: yemah-e ‘rat’). It seems
to work well with words with these allomorphs.

an obstruent or sonorant)

c’ulunk’-icco ‘fingernail’
harr-icco ‘donkey’Some allomorphs of the singular suffix occur as singular counterparts of particular
allomorphs of the plural suffix. Singular forms with one of the allomorphs of the singular
suffix -icco, which is shown in (4.68), often contrast with plural forms with one of the
allomorphs of the plural suffix -iw o (e.g., daan-icc  o ‘elephant’ (PL: daan-iwo),
doobb-icco ‘lion’ (PL: doobb-iwo), haad-icco ‘potter’ (PL: haad-iwo)). Analogously,
-ec c  o seems to contrast with -ewo: er-ecco ‘sheep’ (PL: er-ewo). Also, another
allomorph of the singular suffix -asso (or -usso ) occurs contrastively with one of the
allomorphs of the plural suffix -ado/-adda (or -udda) (e.g., far-asso ‘horse’ (PL: far-ado
or far-adda), al-as s  o ‘monkey’ (PL: al-ado or al-adda), rum-usso ‘root’ (PL:
rum-udda)), though it seems to occur irregularly as well (e.g., ham-asso ‘snake’ (PL:
ham-aso)). There are a small number of words whose singular forms end in -akko and
plural forms end in -ahe (e.g., SG: beedd-akko PL: beedd-ahe ‘star’, SG: fut-akko PL:
fut-ahe ‘mole’, SG: yem-akko, PL: yem-ahe ‘rat’, SG: od-akko, PL: od-ahe ‘[kind of
tree]’, SG: heiy-akko, PL: heiy-ahe ‘[kind of bird]’).
- 347 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 348There is also an allomorph of the singular suffix that can be used for singular
nouns derived from verbs: -aanco. It is attached to a verb root to express ‘sth that one
uses when doing ...’ (e.g., kubb-aanco ‘sth used for jumping over sth’ (kubb- ‘to jump’),
sut-aanco ‘hook’ (sut- ‘to hang’)) (see (4.7) in section 4.2.1.1.1 for more examples; this
suffix form is also used to derive adjectives from verbs, as mentioned earlier and
discussed in section 4.2.1.2). There is also a pair of allomorphs of the singular suffix that
shows contrast in gender: -(aall)icca (masculine)/-(aall)itte (feminine). They are
discussed later in section 4.2.2.2.3.
There are various allomorphs of the plural suffix in Sidaama. The most frequent
way of creating plural noun forms is to repeat the stem-final consonant and add -a to it.(4.69) bis-sa (UM: bise ‘sword’)
man-na (SG: man-co ‘person’)
c’ufan-na (UM: c’ufana ‘door’)
kin-na (SG: kin-co ‘stone’)
doo-a (UM: dooo ‘road’)

siwiil-la (SG: siwiil-co, UM: siwiila ‘iron’)
midaan-na (SG: midaan-co, UM: midaano ‘[clay container]’)
The next common allomorph of the plural suffix is -uwa/-ubba.(4.70) t’ilt-uwa (UM: t’ilte ‘waasa container’)
su’m-uwa (UM: su’ma ‘name’)
urd-uwa (UM: urde ‘spear’)

k’ubb-uwa (SG: k’ubb-icco, UM: k’ubbe ‘finger’)
There are other allomorphs of the plural suffix like the ones in (4.71), which are less
common.","[366, 367, 368, 369, 370]"
"3.1.1 Nouns3.1.1.1 Properties of Nouns
When a noun is modified by another element or elements in an NP, the noun
comes at the end of the NP. NPs can serve as arguments, and it is only NPs that can be
arguments.
Schachter (1985: 7) lists case, number, class or gender, and definiteness as typical
categories associated with nouns. In Sidaama, case is marked with affixes on nouns, and
number and gender may be so marked, which is discussed below and in the next chapter
(Chapter 4 section 4.2.1). However, Sidaama nouns usually do not make a definiteness
distinction morphologically (except that as seen later in Chapter 4 (section 4.2.2.1.5), the
- 77 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 78suffix -nni can express the definiteness of the referent of a common noun used for the
goal of motion and for possession). For example, the referent of any of the NPs in (3.1)
and (3.2), can be interpreted as either definite or indefinite.1(3.1)seeda

(whether the noun form denotes a specific member of the category to which it refers or
refers to the category as a whole), which is a distinction similar to the definiteness
distinction, can be made (the choice of one of the number forms of a noun may lead to
only the generic interpretation when a verb predicate in the imperfect aspect or an
adjective predicate is used, though what form bears such a generic interpretation hinges
on the particular noun).","[98, 99]"
