"4.5.5 ‘Pro-sentences’
Pro-sentences are a closed class of forms each of which can form a sentence on its own. The
pro-clause ay@y ‘yes’ is used as conﬁrmation of a previous statement; or to provide a positive
answer to a question. For instance, if I ask 4.82:
8 While in the village in 2001–2, I spontaneously used two Russian interjections—br1s"", to shoo a cat, and k1S to
shoo birds. The members of Yuamali’s household liked them so much that when I came back in 2004, I was told that
the best way to get rid of a cat is to shout [m br@s""] at the top of your voice.",[136]
"1104 Word Classes4.82 gu
b@ta:y yaku-na-ñ@n?
water already wash-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
‘Have you washed yet?’
the answer ay@y would mean ‘yes, I have’. If I ask 4.83:
4.83 ñ@n
s@
ma: ku?
you.fem.sg sleep neg sleep:neg
‘You didn’t sleep?’
an answer ay@y would mean ‘no, I didn’t’. 9 This form can be replaced with an interjection
ah accompanied with a characteristic facial gesture consisting of a slight raise of eyebrows,
half-closed eyes, and an optional backward head tilt.
The pro-sentence ya:k, or ya:kya (which probably consists of ya:k and the emphatic particle
ya) means ‘OK, ﬁne’ and is a marker of the end of a discourse paragraph, and a pause ﬁller.
A combination of ya:kya as direct speech report slot of the verb wa- ‘say’ and the verb ‘say’
means ‘agree; ﬁnish doing something’ (see §19.5). Speakers who frequently code-switch with
Tok Pisin or English replace ya:kya with orait.
The two declarative negators ma: ‘non-habitual’ and ak@s ‘negative habitual’ can be used as
pro-sentences, that is, as negative answers to questions. A negative can be replaced with a facial
gesture, consisting in a side-to-side head movement. In terms of the verbal form they occur
with, each may be considered a class on its own (see §§14.1–2). The desiderative-purposive
negator ata (see §14.3) is not used as a pro-sentence.
The greeting k@ p@ya:y is a class on its own (see §21.5.3). Syntactically, this is used only as
a greeting, that is a vocative form. It may be related to the address form k@ p, plural k@pugw,
discussed in §4.1.2 above.","[136, 137]"
"14.5.2 Negating questions
Negation of questions, content and polar, follows essentially the same pattern as that of
dependent clauses: the verb is marked with the dependent negation -ma:r-. As expected, a nonverbal predicate has to be used as a copula complement of t@- which is then negated with -ma:rin order to be able to occur in negative questions. Just as with any instances of the dependent
negator -ma:r-, the marker usually goes onto a non-future negative stem (see §11.3.2), as shown
in 14.130. However, this is only a tendency (cf. 14.133).
The diﬀerence between negated questions and negated dependent clauses lies in the presence
of interrogative morphemes in content questions (see §10.4) and also in the intonation contour.
Questions have a rising intonation, while dependent clauses have intonation contours of their
own (we return to these in Chapter 20).
In 14.127, a negative content question is followed by a positive one. Other examples of a
negated content question are at 14.128, and 10.107 (‘How come you didn’t see her?’).

negated in the same way.

‘As that woman far away was staying without looking, you did not look after the dogs

speakers, in particular young and innovative ones, use negative declarative forms, as in 14.131.
A similar example is at 14.151 below.
14.131 l@ du-a:k
ma: r@?
she man-lk+dat neg sit.neg
‘She didn’t get married, did she?’
And secondly, a desubordinated dependent clause can be used as a polar question. Such
questions frequently have overtones of counterexpectation. At the name debating ceremony
(held on 8 October 2004) I was allowed to sit with the men, record, and take pictures.
Dameliway was keeping an eye on me from the women’s quarters; she was worried that I could
have lost my stringbag, and, at ﬁrst opportunity, rushed to me with a worried question:
14.132 ñ@n
kwasabi ku-su-ma:r-@n?
you.fem stringbag put-up-neg.sub-seq
‘How is it that you are not wearing a stringbag (as I expected you would because you
always do)?’
The speaker who said 14.133 was surprised that there was water left in the bucket:
14.133 aw gu
ata
kus@-ma:r-ku?
then water thus/then ﬁnish-neg.sub-compl.ss
‘Then the water is not ﬁnished (or you haven’t ﬁnished the water)?’
Only some same-subject and non-switch-reference-sensitive sequencing clauses undergo
desubordination. We return to this in §19.9. Positive desubordinated clauses are often used
in commands, and in statements, rather than in questions.
That there is a formal connection between questions and dependent clauses comes as no
surprise to a typologist. It is well known that in many languages questions, both negative and
positive, involve clefts with the surface structure of dependent clauses. That this connection in
Manambu reveals itself only under negation is unusual.","[356, 357]"

A development of an emphatic form in a negative construction into a negation marker is
typologically well attested. In Manambu, there is no doubt that this is an innovation. Whether
the root sam- is etymologically linked to the quantiﬁer samasa:m ‘many’ (§10.5) is an open
question.
A number of inherently negative forms are used as pro-clauses, that is, as negative responses.
An inherently negative adverb kapi sapi ‘no way’ is used as a negative response and a negative
pro-clause. This could well be an alliterative compound based on the root kapi cognate to the
negator kupu(k) found in numerous Ndu languages. Its variants are sapi kapi or just kapi. I
was told that sapi can also be used this way, but never found an example.
A proximate demonstrative k@ in highlighting focus (ka, kal (dem.prox+3fem.sgnom) or kad
(dem.prox+3masc.sgnom) ) can be used as an emphatic negator, as in 10.24, 18.26, 14.41, and
14.148:
ka!
14.148 vyau
wa-l@-k
hit+1sgimpv say-3fem.sg-compl.ss dem.prox+3fem.sgnom
‘ “Can I hit (it)?”, said (the younger sister), “No!” (said the elder sister)’
This looks like a demonstrative—however, we cannot rule out that this form is in fact a
remnant of a Proto-Ndu negator with the velar ﬁrst syllable, ultimately cognate with kapi.
The negator most frequently used as a negative pro-clause is ma: ‘no’. It is used as a negative
reaction to a command, as in 14.42, or just to contradict a statement, as in 14.86. It is also used
as a negative response to positive questions, as in 14.149, where it is often accompanied by a
negated verb:
14.149 s@r
ya-k-na-d?
ma:, yæy
ma:
tomorrow come-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt No, come.neg neg
‘ “Will he come tomorrow?” “No, he won’t come” ’
To provide a conﬁrmation to a negative question, ayey ‘yes’ is used, as in 14.150 (also see
§4.5.5 and 4.83). This can optionally be accompanied by a negated verb:33414 Negation14.150 ñ@n

ayey
you.fem night sleep stay-neg.sub-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt Yes
‘ “You didn’t sleep (last) night, did you?” “No, I didn’t (lit. yes)” ’
To refute a negative suggestion, ma: ‘general negator’ or ak@s ‘habitual negator’ is used, as
in 14.151 and 14.51.

‘ “You were not scared (of a plane crash)?” “No, I was scared a lot” ’
The desiderative negator ata is not used this way. The negator ma: is often used to negate
a clause as a whole. It is then postposed to the clause and preceded by a short pause, as in
14.66–8 and 14.152–4.

The negator ma: is often used elliptically in any clause type, as in 14.155–6. The habitual
negator ak@s but not the desiderative negator ata can also be used this way—see 14.50 and
14.157.

clause with the negator ma:; see 14.41. The general negator ma: can occur as a complement of
the verb wa- ‘say’, in the meaning of ‘refuse, say no’, as shown in 9.5, 13.78, and 14.42.
Like most languages of the world, Manambu has numerous other expressions with negative
meanings, such as wa-t@p- (say-be.closed) ‘forbid’ and wuk@-t@p- (hear/think-close) ‘forget’.
However, such terms are not inherently negative because they can be negated just like any
other verb (see §15.3, on their structure).
A recently introduced inherently negative term tabu ‘taboo, forbidden’, from Tok Pisin, is
often used by those speakers who tend to code-switch. It tends to be accompanied by a negative
command in Manambu, as in 14.158 (partly repeated from 14.74).
14.158 [tabu] [war-tukwa]
taboo go.up-proh.gen
‘It is forbidden, don’t go up’
The dependent clause negator -ma:r appears to participate in the formation of two verbs,
wuk@-mar- ‘forget’ (lit. remember/think-neg.sub) and ya:p s@-mar- (breath plant-neg.sub) ‘be
dead’. Both verbs can be negated, and thus are not inherently negative. There is evidence,
however, that -mar- in ‘forget’ and the negator -ma:r- may be lookalikes and not cognates.
First, the component -mar- in the verb ‘forget’ does not have a long vowel. Secondly, as we
saw in 12.71 (§12.8.2), this component undergoes partial reduplication quite diﬀerent from the
reduplication of the negator -ma:r-. Another example of such partial reduplication meaning
‘fully’ is at 14.159:
14.159 k@k@t@p kui-ku,

‘Having given (him) the K@k@t@p feast (mortuary feast), this way we have forgotten all
about him’
We saw in §14.5.1 that the negator -ma:r- can undergo reduplication of a diﬀerent sort: an
example of the reduplicated negator used to negate ‘in case’ conditional clauses is at 14.126. A
similar example is at 14.160, where the verb wuk@- ‘hear, listen, think’ is negated this way. The
form wuk@-marmar-@k can mean ‘unless/lest I forget’, or ‘for me not to forget’.
14.160 suku
(k@pa:b) wuk@-marmar-@k
write+1sg.impv in.case think-neg.sub.red-dat
‘Let me write it down lest I might not think (of it)’
That the negator -ma:r- and the component -mar- in what look like verbs with negative
meanings are reduplicated diﬀerently shows that, at least synchronically, they are diﬀerent
forms.
Despite the wealth of negative constructions in Manambu, additional negative strategies
may be employed. As shown in 14.73, questions are often used in negative meanings. In 14.161,
a question implies a negative command: the girl was not supposed to drink too much water
because there was no place for her to go to the toilet:
14.161 toilet yi-k-ñ@na

(Bowden 1997: 12–13).
There is no evidence for any other loans, except for a few curious similarities with Oceanic.
One such similarity is the Manambu irregular imperatives of the verb ya- ‘come’, mæy, and
of the verb yi- ‘go’, ma:y (see Table 13.2). The form mæy ‘come’ looks very much like ProtoOceanic ∗ mai ‘come’ (see, for instance, Lynch, Ross, and Crowley 2002: 47). Could this be
a borrowing, or is it a simple coincidence? A potential cognate to either mæy or ma:y is the
Abelam imperative marker mé (Wilson 1980: 165), which does not preclude the possibility of
the form being borrowed from coastal Oceanic languages in northern New Guinea. And we
can recall, from §1.5.3, that at least one clan group of the Manambu claims to have come from
the coast.
The term for ‘dog’, a:s(a), is especially intriguing in light of this. It bears a similarity
to Proto-Austronesian ∗ asu ‘dog’, reconstructed on the basis of reﬂexes in the languages of
Taiwan, the Philippines, western Indonesia, and others, but hitherto unattested in any Oceanic
language with which a Papuan language could have come in contact. A number of Oceanic
languages of Bougainville have a form for ‘dog’ reconstructible as ∗∗ kasu; however, positing a
reconstruction higher than Proto-North-Bougainville appears to be dubious (Andrew Pawley,
p.c.). The dog was introduced to New Guinea through coastal areas, and perhaps through
maritime coastal trade into the Sepik-Ramu area, and the date given is circa 5500 bc. The
archaeological data indicate that the introduction of the dog in New Guinea may have been
consistent with the Lapita/Austronesian culture (Jack Golson, p.c.). If the dog was indeed
introduced by Austronesians in the coastal areas, and then spread further inland, it would not
be surprising that the name for dog could have been of Austronesian descent. The word wa:sa
‘dog’ in Abelam may indicate that if the term for ‘dog’ was indeed borrowed, the borrowing
could have occurred at the Proto-Ndu stage. This, however, is pure speculation.
Manambu (and other Ndu languages) have a number of further lookalikes with Oceanic
and Austronesian. Proto-Oceanic ∗ manuk ‘bird’ (with its variants manu, ma:n, or ma:n in
coastal New Guinea languages: Andrew Pawley, p.c.) is similar to Manambu ma:n, Iatmul
ma:n, and Kwoma manu ‘bird of paradise’. And Proto-Oceanic ∗ taw ‘man’ could be compared
to the Proto-Ndu ∗ du(e) ‘man, male’ (cf. Boiken tuo ‘man’ which earned Boiken the name
Tuo-language by Kirschbaum 1922). However, these are likely to be mere coincidences.
Curious ‘foreign language’ insertions occur in the stories which comprise my Manambu
corpus. Gemaj, a highly qualiﬁed story teller, quoted an evil character who, according to
her, was speaking ‘dry-land man’s language’ (n@b@-du kudi wa:d dry.land-man language

two diﬀerent occasions. Insertions in the unidentiﬁed language are in italics.

So far, I haven’t been able to identify these inserts. It is obvious that they come from the same
language. Judging by the person marking, it appears to be a Ndu language (but not Gala).
The obvious source is Kaunga (the closest ‘dry-land people’ who speak a Ndu language: see
Harrison 1993: 33–4 on the Manambu–Kaunga relations). This needs to be veriﬁed when more
Kaunga data become available.
It is possible that some examples of ‘animal talk’ are in fact insertions from other languages,
e.g. sakatelo ‘sound made by man transformed into a victoria pigeon’.
Very few grammatical descriptions, and dictionaries, are as yet available for most languages
of the Sepik area. At the present time, we have many more questions than answers as to
why some of the Sepik languages share rather unusual, ‘exotic’ features. Can it be a simple
coincidence that shape-based gender assignment is attested in Ndu languages, and in Alamblak
and Sare, or Kapriman (both Sepik Hill) (Bruce 1984; Sumbuk 1999)? And that the unusual
patterns of cross-referencing in Manambu (§3.1) are so strikingly similar to those in Alamblak?
What is the nature of the areal diﬀusion of patterns within the Sepik area? These questions are
undecidable—until well-founded facts can be provided.
Nowadays, the major agents of foreign inﬂuence on Manambu are Tok Pisin and English,
the two lingua francas of Papua New Guinea as a whole.22.4 i n f lu e n c e o f t o k pi s i n a n d o f e n g l i s h: b o r row i n g
and code- s w i tc h i n g
At present, all the Manambu people are proﬁcient in Tok Pisin: there are no Manambu
monolinguals. As mentioned in Chapter 1, just a few old ladies are more comfortable speaking
Manambu than Tok Pisin. I was told that two children in Avatip (one 4, one 6 years of age,
in 2004) speak nothing but Manambu; but no one seemed to know exactly where they lived,
or how to ﬁnd them. Schooling is conducted in Papua New Guinea English (see §1.4.2 on
the incipient Manambu ‘tok ples’ programmes in primary schools in Yawabak and Avatip).
The result is not really a balanced triglossia: Tok Pisin and English tend to dominate many
domains, such as village council, churches, and parent–teacher meetings. The latter is not so
surprising given that of a dozen or so teachers at the Avatip school, two or three are usually
not Manambu, and even those teachers who are Manambu prefer communicating in English
or Tok Pisin to make sure they do not exclude the outsiders or those children whose Manambu
is halting.","[629, 630, 631, 632]"

We have already seen (20.49b) that a verbless clause may have an overtone of spontaneity. It
appears to be also the case in instances like 20.52a.
iii. Summarizing a preceding stretch of discourse can be achieved through using an adverbial
demonstrative on its own, in a verbless clause (and without a predicative marker), as in 20.53a.
An alternative is to use the word ‘manner’ in a similar structure—another verbless clause:
20.53a akatawa
thus
‘This is how it is’
20.53b akatawa sa:d
thus
way
‘This way (it is)’
An alternative for each of these would be either a predicative form of adverbial demonstrative (akatawa-n-a for 20.53a), or a non-verbal clause (akatawa sa:d-a for 20.53b). The verbless
versions sound more spontaneous and informal.
iv. Verbless clauses are used in a presentational function, as in T1.2.
v. Verbless clauses are used in questions (see C below) which involve manner and are marked
with the question words ata ata ‘how how’, as in 10.100, and agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’,
as in 10.98. Verbless clauses are also employed in questions involving naming, as in 10.102 and
20.54:
20.54 ata maway s@?
how ﬂower name
‘What’s the name of the ﬂower?’
Verbless clauses are also used in short questions used to enquire after someone: 20.55 is the
way of asking a child about his or her mother and father—that is, where they are, are they OK,
and so on:
20.55 amæy? asa:y?
mother father
‘(What about) mother? Father?’
A similar example is at 20.58—this is a question addressed to unknown beings in order to
ﬁnd out what food they would be capable of eating.
The interrogative pronoun ak@- ‘where’ (as in Table 10.7, example 10.90) is used in nonverbal clauses, since it requires non-verbal cross-referencing.
If negated, verbless clauses are indistinguishable from non-verbal ones: 20.56 is a negative
version of both a non-verbal clause l@ T@k@ta:y-a (she Teketay-3fem.sgnom) ‘she is Teketay’
and a verbless clause l@ T@k@ta:y ‘she is Teketay’:52820 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices20.56 l@ T@k@ta:y ma:
she Teketay neg
‘She is not Teketay’
Table 20.1 summarizes the properties which diﬀerentiate between copula clauses, verbless
clauses, and two types of clauses with non-verbal predicates—those involving demonstratives
with the predicative marker -n- and the rest.
The arguments in favour of considering non-verbal clauses as a separate type of clauses
headed by non-verbs are: (a) kind of cross-referencing markers used, or lack thereof; (b)
negation; (c) tense distinctions expressed with cross-referencing; (d) occurrence in subordinate
clauses and in non-indicative moods; (e) semantics; (f) use in highlighting focus constructions;
and (g) constituent order.
Unlike copula clauses—which are similar to normal verbal clauses in all but their (lack of)
capacity to form commands—they are negated in the same, non-verbal, way, and have a strictly
subject-predicate order (see §20.2). Clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic demonstratives
in the predicate slot share more properties with verbless clauses than they do with non-verbal
clauses.
But how do we identify grammatical relations, especially in verbless clauses? This is to be
taken up in §20.1.4.
B. Imperative clauses are always independent, and contain partially inﬂected imperativepermissive forms discussed in §13.2. Copula clauses, clauses with non-verbal predicates, and
verbless clauses cannot occur in imperative clauses. Some verbs—such as perception verbs—
have a telic meaning when used in commands; that is, 20.57 can only mean ‘you listen’ rather
than ‘you hear’ or ‘you understand’. (A loan verb understand was used in a command urging a
child to understand what the mother was saying and to act accordingly, in 17.26b.) We return
to the ways in which ‘see’ and ‘hear’ are used in commands in §21.1.2.
The ways in which imperatives can be negated were addressed in §14.4. An imperative
strategy can be used in lieu of an imperative-permissive form—see Table 19.5, to express
additional overtones to do with strength of the command.
The constituent order in imperative clauses follows the same principles as that in declarative
clauses (see §20.2): it is predominantly verb ﬁnal, but a constituent can be postposed to the
verb for disambiguation or if the participant is unexpected (see T1.16).
Imperative clauses have a rising intonation on the verb, if they imply a command, and even
if used as a turn-taking device, as in 20.57.
20.57 b@r
awuk
you.du impv+listen
‘You (two) listen!’
Permissive forms (see §13.2.2), which are often used in turn taking, tend to be pronounced with
an interrogative rising intonation—see C below.
C. Interrogative clauses correspond to either polar or content questions. We mentioned in
§10.4 that content questions are marked with a question word and slightly rising intonation,
while polar questions are marked by intonation only. There is no structural diﬀerence between
a positive polar question and a corresponding statement. Only the intonation and the context
decides. Some examples are at 10.79 and further examples in §10.4, 20.14–15, the last clauses of
T1.4 and T1.18, and the ﬁrst clause of T1.14. The last clause of T2.26 contains an ‘identiﬁcation
construction’ cast as a question.","[553, 554, 555]"

as in 20.55 and 20.58 (which contains a relative clause).
20.58 [ [b@r n@b@ k@-k@-bra]
[k@k@pa:t] ]
you.du able eat-fut-2dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt food
‘(What about) food you two will be able to eat?’
These clauses would not make sense as declarative verbless clauses, since—as we saw in A
above—verbless declarative clauses contain at least two independent NPs.
Polar questions display the same patterns of constituent order as do declarative clauses: 13.56
is an example of an oblique, ‘with them’, placed after the verb (see §20.2). Content questions
also display the same patterns.
A question word does not have a ﬁxed position in a clause. It tends to gravitate towards the
beginning of the clause or to appear immediately before the verb, as in 10.87–8, T1.5, T1.30,
and T3.8. The only exceptions are verbless clauses involving the question word ata ata ‘how
how’ as in 10.100–2, and agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’ (10.98): here the constituent order is
ﬁxed.
The pronoun s@ ‘who?’ is unlike other interrogative words in that it takes the linker -k@- in
order to combine with case markers. It is obligatorily marked for highlighting focus if in the
subject position. And if it is used as predicate head, as in 10.82, or is marked for focus, as in
10.83, and 20.59, its form is reminiscent of a headless associative NP (as illustrated in 8.14):
it takes gender-number markers -l- ‘feminine’, -d- ‘masculine’, -bra- ‘dual’, and -di- ‘plural’,
followed by a nominal predicate cross-referencing enclitic.

Examples like 20.59–60 can be interpreted as instances of obligatory grammaticalized focus,
not infrequent in content interrogatives worldwide. We will see, at §20.3 below, that a focused
constituent can only rarely be in the A function.
The interrogative ‘who’ can be marked for double focus; then the nominal cross-referencing
is repeated. The meaning is highly contrastive: ‘who is it really?’ (see §20.3). In 20.60, the
speaker is wondering whether the mysterious person who had entered his house is a man or a
woman.

who are staying?’
A clause may consist just of a question word, as in the last clause of T1.23. And any verbal
form, including the permissive (13.10), can occur in a question.
When negated, both content and polar questions take the negative dependent clause marker
-ma:r- if they contain a verb—see 14.127–30. However, as we saw in §14.5.2, this is not the only
option. Many speakers (and especially young and innovative ones) use negative declarative
forms in negative questions, as in 14.131 and 14.151. If a negative question contains a nonverbal or a verbless clause, it has the same structure as its positive counterpart:20.1 Major constituents53120.61 k@

good neg
‘Is this food not good?’
Further issues, including the patterns of response to negative questions, were discussed in
§14.5.2.","[555, 556, 557, 558]"
"20.1 Major constituents517Another type of complex predicate with temporal meaning is restricted to dependent clauses
only and consists of a verb marked with the sequential -n and the generic completive verb
napa- accompanied by the appropriate clause-chaining marker(s) (see §18.9). The order of
components is ﬁxed. Modal complex predicates consist of one of the two modal verbs (see
§4.5.1, and examples 4.64–6 and 15.53) both meaning ‘be able to, can’ followed by an inﬂected
verb. These complex predicates cannot be negated, questioned, or occur in a command. The
order of components is also ﬁxed.
All the complex predicates consist of two independent grammatical and phonological words.
The components of complex predicates containing polyfunctional verbs (§§17.1–4) tend to be
contiguous. Unlike noun phrases, however, they are not strictly contiguous. Constituents such
as ata ‘then’, reactivated topic demonstratives, and adverbs can intervene between them, as in
12.81, 17.44, and 20.23.
20.23 day vak@r-@k
ata kur-di
they fall-purp.ss then do/get-3plbas.vt/p
‘They then were about to fall down’
In contrast, in 17.23, ata precedes the whole complex predicate. The diﬀerence is in the degree
of its topicality: the closer the constituent is to the beginning of the clause the more likely it is
to be a newly introduced topic.
And we can recall, from §14.1.3, that aspectual and positional complex predicates allow the
negator to precede the whole predicate, as in 14.29 and 20.24a, as a means of focusing on the
lexical verb. We were talking about various places in Australia, and the speaker was telling us
that he had never seen Melbourne with his own eyes.
20.24a wun Melburnam
ma: væn
t@
I
Melbourne+lk+acc/loc neg see+seq ‘stand’+neg
‘I haven’t seen Melbourne’
Alternatively, the negator can precede the auxiliary, and there is no focusing eﬀect, as in
20.24b—an answer to a question as to whether anyone had seen the little boy.
20.24b wun d@-k@-m
væn
ma: t@
I
he-obl-acc/loc see+seq neg ‘stand’+neg
‘I haven’t seen him’
Aspectual complex predicates contain the sequencing verb form in -n (see §18.2) also used
to link clauses. However, the negator can have such an eﬀect only in complex predicates, and
never in linked clauses. This demonstrates the diﬀerences in the synchronic status of the -n
forms within monoclausal complex predicates and within multiclausal structures.
In contrast, complex predicates with napa- ‘generic completive verb’ and with the two modal
verbs are always contiguous. They are also restricted in their use: neither can be negated, or
appear in any other clause types.
We can recall that the lexical verb which appears with napa- is always marked with the
sequential -n (see §18.9), while modal verbs allow for two options. The inﬂected verb can take
third person feminine past tense cross-referencing (as in 4.64–6 and 20.25a), and the resulting
construction has impersonal overtones and never occurs with ﬁrst person subject.
20.25a m@n
[n@b@ wakw@-l]
ma:
you.masc able go.out-3fem.sgbas.p again
‘You can go out again’51820 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesOr the inﬂected verb can be marked for person, number, and gender of the subject (as in 4.64,
15.53, and 20.25b). Then, there are no restrictions as to the person of the subject. The inﬂected
verb itself can appear in the future form, as in 4.64, 15.53, 20.25b, and 20.58, in the versatile
tense form, as in 19.58b, or in the past tense form, as in 20.25a. The choice is determined by
the presence of a future projection: 15.53, 19.58b, and 20.25b contain a threat, while 20.58 is a
question.
20.25b n@b@ kiya-k-na-ñ@n-@k
ya
can die-fut-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf emph
‘You can die (if you come near the broken ladder)’

meal:
20.25c s@r
n@b@ k@-da-l
tomorrow can eat-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
‘They can eat (this food) tomorrow’
No other forms of inﬂected verbs have been attested in the corpus. This suggests that clauses
containing the two modal verbs have a realis–irrealis type distinction not attested anywhere
else in the language. That is, they constitute a special clause type, albeit rare and restricted.
This takes us to the next issue—the clause types and their properties.","[543, 544, 545]"
"6.2 Number agreement1436.40 k@-b@r
laulap mugul
k@-di
dem.prox-du banana three/few eat-3plbas.p
‘After they have eaten a few (two or three) bananas . . . ’
If a noun phrase with mugul refers to exactly three entities, the agreement is plural: 6.41 is
about having exactly three classiﬁcatory mothers.
6.41 k@-di
amæy mugul t@-da-l-a
fem.prox-pl mother three have-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
‘This is how they had these three mothers’
Dual agreement with mugul in the meaning of ‘a few’ suggests that, at an earlier stage, the
dual number in Manambu could have had the meaning of ‘paucal’, referring not necessarily
exactly to two entities, but rather to a small number of entities. The forms and semantics of
dual agreement in Ndu languages are considered in Aikhenvald (forthcoming b).
Plural agreement is used in a variety of further contexts. Plural agreement is the unmarked
choice in content questions if the speaker has no idea about the sex or the quantity of people
they are asking about, as in 6.42.
6.42 s@
kulapu-na-di
who clean-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Who cleaned (the path)?’
Along similar lines, the question in 6.43 contains a plural form of ‘child’, and yet the answer
could be in the singular—that is, the plural is used as a kind of cover term for all numbers. This
choice may also have to do with the semantics of the interrogative quantiﬁer kas which implies
a non-singular quantity.
6.43 d@-k@-m
ñan-ugw kas?
he-obl-loc child-pl how.many/much
‘How many children does he have?’
A ﬁnal piece of evidence in favour of plural being less marked functionally than dual comes
from mistakes and slips of the tongue. It is not infrequent for any speaker to mistake dual
participants for plural. In 6.44, the speaker is talking about two people. She ﬁrst uses dual, and
then refers to them with plural; later on she corrects herself again.

Mistakes like this are always ‘in favour’ of plural. It is as yet too early to say that the dual is
on its way out. However, these examples may indicate that within non-singular numbers, plural
is less functionally marked than the dual.","[169, 170]"
"17.4 Body part constructions as complex predicates439The class of lexicalized compounds may be extended to include a variety of ﬁxed expressions
involving polyfunctional verbs and nouns or adjectives, e.g. yawi kur- (work do-) ‘work’;
sua:l kur- (lie do) and sua:l taka- (lie put) ‘lie’, m@wulam r@- (inside+loc sit) ‘stay in one’s
memory, be remembered’, yara r@- ‘live OK, be in place’, k@p kwa- (just stay) ‘be messing
about, doing nothing’, yara kwa- ‘be OK (or not)’. Some such ﬁxed expressions containing
positional verbs can be considered copula clauses with a somewhat unpredictable idiomatic
meaning (see §20.1.3). They diﬀer from lexicalized complex predicates, discussed at some length
in this section, in that their nominal component can be questioned. One can ask at@ta kwa-na?
(how stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘How is she?’ and receive an answer yara kwa-na ‘she is
ﬁne’, or k@p kwa-na ‘she is messing about, doing nothing’.
Not so with m@wulam r@- (inside+loc sit) ‘stay in one’s memory, be remembered’. One can
say a ma:j m@wulam r@-na (dem.dist.fem.sg story inside+loc sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) and
this means ‘I remember that story’, literally ‘that story sits in my inside’ (see §21.4 about mawul
‘inside’ as a location for human emotions and memory). But one cannot ask a question a ma:j
agwam r@-na? (dem.dist.fem.sg story what+lk+loc stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘where does
the story sit?’ and receive an answer ∗ m@wulam r@-na. An appropriate answer to such a question
would involve a concrete location, for instance, bukam r@-na ‘it is in the book/notebook’.
Similarly with dua:k r@- (man+lk+dat sit) ‘get married (of a woman)’: a question s@-k@-k
ra:l? (who-obl-dat sit+3fem.sgbas.p) always has the meaning of ‘Who did she marry?’ One
can question yawi in yawi kur- ‘work’, but not sua:l in sua:l kur- or its synonym sua:l taka- ‘lie,
tell a lie’.
In such idiomatic constructions the verb itself may be so easily recoverable from the context
that it can be omitted in elliptical discourse, as shown in 17.54. A woman says 17.54 to the
spirit, and the spirit answers 17.55.

There appears to be a continuum between semantically compositional constructions containing polyfunctional verbs, and fully lexicalized idiomatic entities. These idiomatic collocations have to be listed in a dictionary.
We will now turn to the discussion of another set of constructions which show semantic and
formal aﬃnity with lexicalized complex predicates.17.4 b o dy pa rt c o n s t ru c t i o n s a s c o m p l e x p r e d i c at e s
Body part constructions consist of a formally unmarked noun followed by a semantically
appropriate verb. The noun is a body part, or a physical or other state with respect to which the
process is happening. Such constructions describe states, and thus cannot occur in aspectual
and modal complex predicates (§17.1).
Many body part constructions in Manambu are composed of a physical state or a body part
nominal followed by one of the polyfunctional verbs listed in Table 4.1, e.g. ka:m ‘hunger’ as in
ka:m yasa-/yas@- ‘feel hunger’ and s@ ‘sleep’ in s@ yasa-/yas@- ‘feel sleepy’ (see other examples
in 4.26a–d and 17.56a). The order of components is ﬁxed.","[465, 466]"
"21.5.1 Manambu ‘small’ talk

The verb ‘stay’ can be omitted. To continue the same kind of conversation, the interlocutor
may add ñ@na:k (you.fem+lk+dat) lit. ‘for you’, meaning ‘how about you, it is you I am
asking/worrying about’. We can recall, from 20.55, that verbless clauses are also used in short
questions to enquire after someone’s location or well-being in general. As an alternative way
of enquiring after someone’s health and well-being, a verbless clause or a copula clause can be
used:

he-obl+fem.sg skin ﬁne good stand/be-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt

When the speaker decides that they have no more questions to ask, or nothing else to add,
they come up with the conversation stopper ma:j ma: (talk neg) ‘no more talk’—an exact
equivalent, and maybe a calque, of Tok Pisin nogat tok (cf. 21.31c).","[611, 612]"
"19.5 Speech reports489A. wa- ‘say’ as a ditransitive verb can appear in two frames.
First, the verb wa- can take two NP objects meaning ‘telling someone something’, or ‘telling
someone about something’. Its second argument is an addressee. The object (as in 19.1) or the
addressee (as in 19.59) can be cross-referenced in the second position if appropriate.

A similar example is in T2.67. We will see, in §19.8, that wa- in this usage can occur with
a headless relative clause in the O slot used as a complementation strategy. The object is
questioned with agwa ja:p ‘what?’ (see §10.4) used to question direct objects of any kind
(cf. example 10.84). The verb wa- can also mean ‘promise’, and is then used ditransitively.
The thing ‘promised’ is the object, which can also be questioned with agwa ja:p ‘what?’

‘Here are the things I promised her’
Secondly, the verb wa- as ditransitive verb can occur with a name in what looks like an object
slot, and the object or person named as a second argument, as in T2.3 (‘those whom we call
Gala’) and in T2.18 (this (man) by that name of Kamkudi), 19.12, and 19.76. In 19.61, it is
used with a reciprocal awarwa in the meaning of ‘address each other as (name)’.

ma:m
awarwa wa-na-b@r
younger.sibling elder.sibling rec
say-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘They two address each other as siblings’ (lit. say younger sibling elder sibling to each
other)
The object or person named can be cross-referenced on the verb, and questioned either with
agwa ja:p ‘what?’, or s@ ‘who?’ (see §10.4). In contrast, the name is never cross-referenced on
the verb. It is questioned with ata ‘how?’, just like NP objects in the examples discussed at B
below, and direct speech reports.
B. wa- ‘say’ as a transitive verb can take an NP object if the NP is something being said, e.g.
‘verse’ in 10.113, or a wrong word in 19.62a. A young girl instructed an older speaker not to
use a Tok Pisin word:
19.62a lukautim wa-tukwa
lukautim say-proh.gen
‘Do not say lukautim!’
It can also be used in describing ways of pronouncing a word, as in 19.62b:
19.62b [n@k@-di ta:kw sajagalavi wa-kwa-na-di]

by a non-human, e.g. kudi aka wa-na (language dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg speakact.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she (the pot with water boiling) is making a sound’, or t@b kudi wa-na
(sky language speak-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘thunder is sounding’ (lit. sky speaks language).
Alternatively, the sound itself can be reproduced, as in 19.63:
19.63 tapwuk [p@kaka:u]
ada
wa:d
rooster cockadoodledoo dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg say+3masc.sgbas.p
‘The rooster said: “cock-a-doodle-doo” ’, or ‘The rooster sang’
In this use, the verb wa- allows for cross-referencing the addressee, or the time, or the manner
as appropriate, and also the object NP referring to what’s being said. What is being said can be
questioned with ata ‘how’. This is similar to direct speech reports—see C below.
The verb wa- forms a number of idiomatic collocations with interjections and adverbs, e.g.
ay wa- (ay say-) ‘let know’, ya:k wa- or ya:kya wa- (OK say) ‘agree, accept; say OK’. The
combination vyak@ta wa- (good say) means ‘approve’, and ma: wa- means ‘refuse; reject’. These
are lexicalized: the meaning of the whole is not easily deducible from the meanings of the parts.
And the component in the speech report slot cannot be questioned.
A reported command cast as purposive indirect speech report is a purposive clause, of
the type discussed in §19.4 above (see 19.54). It occupies the object slot of the verb wa- as
a transitive verb. If the content of a reported command has to be questioned, ata is used.
Alternatively, a constituent within a purposive clause can be questioned as appropriate (see
§10.4). The ﬁrst person imperative-permissive wa:u ‘may I talk?’ is used intransitively, as a
turn-taking device.
C. wa- ‘say’ with a direct speech report: transitive or ditransitive?
A direct speech report cannot be considered a direct object of the verb wa- since it can never
be cross-referenced on this verb, and has to be questioned with the adverbial interrogative ata
‘how’ or its reduplicated version ata ata. The question at 19.64 can be answered with 19.61,
19.62a–b, or 19.53:
19.64 ata (ata) wa-na?
how
say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘What did she say?’
The same question word can be used to question the sound made by a rooster in 19.63.
An adverbial demonstrative ‘thus’ is used to anaphorically refer to a speech report:
19.65 [mæy, mæy] k@tawa wa-na
come, come like.this say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘ “Come, come”, this is what she said’ (lit. like this she said)
Addressee, time, manner can be cross-referenced on the verb of speech accompanied by a direct
speech report, as in T1.23, T2.7, and T1.26 (see §3.1, for the discussion of cross-referencing).
The speech report can never be cross-referenced.
We can thus conclude that direct speech report is not a prototypical object. However, it
is obligatory, and therefore is to be considered a core argument of the verb ‘say’. It is best
considered a special grammatical relation.
The transitivity patterns described in this section only apply to the underived verb wa-. When
accompanied by directionals, or when used as ﬁrst component in verb compounds, wa- can be
used either transitively or ditransitively, like any other verb which displays this transitivity
alternation (see §4.2.2 and Chapters 15 and 16).","[515, 516, 517]"

[kur@-n

you.fem take.care-seq stay.impv
‘You (feminine) stay looking after (the baby)’
Constituent order in imperative clauses is similar to that in declarative clauses. The O can
follow the verb if it is an established topic, as in 13.4:
13.4 m@n
ak@r
k@
ta:kw Kamkudi
you.masc impv+marry dem.prox.fem.sg woman Kamkudi
‘You marry this woman, Kamkudi!
A topically established subject can occasionally follow the verb, as in 13.5:
13.5 adakw
b@r
stay.impv you.du
‘You two stay!’
Two second person imperatives can follow each other in one sentence, expressing two concomitant actions, as in 13.6:
13.6 ma:y
gur
awakw
go.impv you.pl impv+go.out
‘Go, you (plural) go out’
Any imperative form can be accompanied by the hortative jau ‘don’t worry; you may do it’
(see §4.5), as in 4.78 and 13.7, with the meaning of letting something happen:
13.7 jau
a-war
don’t.worry impv-go.up
‘Go up (into the house) without any restraint’
Similar examples, with other persons, are at 13.17 and 13.23. Just like any other command,
second person imperative often occurs followed by the emphatic particle ya, to make a command sound more urgent (see §4.5, and also 13.14).
B. First person imperatives have slightly diﬀerent meaning overtones depending on the
number value. First person singular imperative has permissive meaning, and is often used for
mild requests.

In yes-no questions, the implication is that of the speaker’s intention to be conﬁrmed by the
addressee. After we came back from a tiring trip to Yawabak, Dora took a limbum leaf and
asked me:28013 Mood and Modality13.11 yabru
fan+1sgimpv
‘Shall I fan (you) (to cool you oﬀ)?’
This same form occurs in general statements of intention without any implication of permission, as in 13.12. Note the person marker -m@n rather than the expected -d@m@n: this may
indicate an emergent new non-declarative form.

A command to a second person can be echoed by a command to a ﬁrst person, as in 13.13.
Here, the tree kangaroo is telling his mate and himself who is going to occupy what seat on a
canoe. The tree kangaroo is not asking for permission—he is stating what he is going to do.

The two positional verbs used here (‘sit’ and ‘stand’) share one second person imperative;
but have diﬀerent forms in other persons.
First person non-singular (dual and plural) forms of imperative are usually employed as
hortatives (‘let’s do something’) as in 13.14. The emphatic particle ya makes the command
sound truly urgent.

As illustrated in 13.13, ﬁrst person singular imperative can occur with ﬁrst person singular
pronoun if it is contrastive: the tree kangaroo contrasts himself to his companion on the canoe.
Non-singular ﬁrst person pronouns can be used in a similar way. We can recall that with
second person imperatives, second person pronouns have a somewhat diﬀerent function of
disambiguating number and gender of the addressee.
C. Third person imperative is used for commands and instructions with reference to a third
person, as shown in 13.15. There are no semantic diﬀerences between singular and non-singular
numbers; and an overt subject NP can be supplied, if necessary.

as in 13.16—an instruction on how to take sore throat lozenges.","[305, 306, 307]"
"14.3 Negation of non-indicative modalities311That is, whether the condition is counterfactual or not can only be decided in the context of a
whole sentence. The form of the verb in a main clause may provide additional clues.
For example, 14.56 is ambiguous as to whether the condition is counterfactual or not: the
main clause form is ambiguous between irrealis and future. Inserting a time word—such as s@r
‘tomorrow’ or nal ‘yesterday’—would have disambiguated this sentence.
14.56 [væki-ma:r-k-la]

go.down-fut/irr-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
‘If she does not go across, I will go down (to meet her)’ or
‘If she had not gone across, I would have gone down (to meet her)’
In contrast, 14.57 can only have a counterfactual reading because of the negative irrealis
form in the main clause.

‘If she had not gone across, I would not have gone down (to meet her)’
And 14.58 is not counterfactual since the main clause contains a non-irrealis form:
14.58 [gan@b s@

[sik t@-kwa-na-wun]
sick be-hab-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
‘If I do not sleep (the next) morning, I usually am sick’
An adverb, a copula complement, or the object of ‘have’ can intervene between the irrealis
negator and the inﬂected verb, as shown in 14.54 and 14.59. In contrast to the habitual negator
ak@s (see, for example, 14.48) inserting more than one-word constituents between the irrealis
negator and the verb results in unnatural expressions.

‘Simon Harrison’s book would not have got bad (if we had proper storage space)’
Just as with discontinuous constructions involving the habitual negator ak@s, the eﬀect is that
of focusing on the constituent which is placed after the negator.
Just like the habitual negator ak@s in 14.50, the irrealis negator can be used elliptically if
the irrealis value is immediately recoverable from the context—this was illustrated in 14.55.
However, it cannot be used as a negative response (unlike the habitual negator in 14.51).
The irrealis negator ak@s is also used to negate the optative modality formed on irrealis, as
in 13.40. Another example is at 14.60: this is a very strong wish for the unwanted guest not to
turn up:
ya-k@-na-d-@u
14.60 ak@s
neg.irr come-irr-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-opt
‘May he not come!!!’31214 NegationNegative optative constructions are rare in discourse. They cannot be discontinuous, and do
not occur in non-main clauses (we recall, from §13.2.3 and §13.3, that the positive optative does
not occur in non-main clauses either). The optative modality formed on ﬁrst and third person
imperatives cannot be negated (see §14.4 for negative imperatives).
Are the two morphemes with the same shape—ak@s ‘habitual negative’ and ak@s ‘irrealis
negator’—the same morpheme or diﬀerent morphemes? Synchronically speaking, they are
better considered as distinct, given that the conditions of their use, their meanings, and
syntactic properties are diﬀerent. Diachronically speaking, the question remains open. It is not
uncommon for irrealis and habitual to be expressed with the same morpheme—as, for instance,
English would. However, since analogy is not a proof, the question concerning any etymological
link between the two forms with the shape ak@s remains open until more comparative data
become available.","[337, 338, 339]"

a car’
Typologically speaking, focus constructions are often expressed via cleft clauses which, in
their turn, involve marking part of a clause as dependent. That a dependent clause negator is
used in focused clauses conﬁrms that such clauses may be considered underlyingly dependent.
However, there are no other overt indicators that the clause is desubordinated.
Desubordinated clauses containing fully inﬂected verbs are also negated with the dependent
clause negator -ma:r-. In 14.136, the elliptical answer to the question contains a desubordinated
relative clause:
14.136 ak@

‘When (lit. what time) did the earthquake strike? (Time when) you had not come’
In 14.137, what could have been phrased as a causal clause, just like 14.116 and the ﬁrst
clause of 14.55, was phrased as an independent clause negated with -ma:r- followed by the
conjunction al@k ‘this is why’ as an afterthought. This was Gemaj’s answer to an unstated
question why my sandals were getting loose.

‘You do not eat real food, this is why’
We will see, in §19.9, that same-subject completive forms of the verb t@- ‘be, have’ are
developing into conjunctions which introduce what are treated as dependent clauses containing
fully inﬂected verbs. That this is really the case is corroborated by the fact that such newly
developed dependent clauses are negated with the dependent negator -ma:r-, as shown in
14.138. This is a comment on why a neighbouring group does not have any traditional masks
left:

‘They gave away the things from men’s house for money, this is why they do not have

Independent clauses can be negated with -ma:r- if they express wishes and regrets. Dameliway and myself developed a mutual liking for each other from the very ﬁrst meeting, at the end
of which she exclaimed:
14.139 oh, walba:b kwa-ma:r-na-dian

14.140 wan@b yi-ma:r-na

‘May she not make noise! (meaning I wish she did not make noise)’
Along similar lines, 14.141 expresses a regret concerning the ﬁshing grounds spoilt forever.

An independent clause negated with -ma:r- may also have an irrealis meaning if it occurs
with future marking; this is always mixed with a wish for the thing not to happen:

‘Wash these plates, or else you may not get the food’
The ways in which independent negative clauses marked with -ma:r- are used to express
meanings covering wishes, regrets, negative irrealis, and undesirable consequences can be
ultimately traced back to the negative focused clauses (as illustrated in 14.134–5): all of these
involve focusing on the non-activity.
The marker -ma:r- appears to be cognate to the negative imperative -mar-ék in Wosera
(Wilson 1980: 164–5). The use of the morpheme -ma:r- to express wishes is a link between
otherwise hardly comparable meanings of Manambu -ma:r- and Wosera -marék.14.6 i n h e r e n t ly ne gat i v e l e x e m e s a n d n e gat i v e p ro-c laus e s
Manambu has a number of inherently negative forms. These cannot be negated, and occur in
a negative context only.
The adverb s@m@rab, s@ma:b, sama:b or s@ms@ma:b ‘never ever’ is typically used in negated
clauses as an emphatic negator. It occurs both in declarative clauses which already have the
negator ma: as in 14.144 and T3.43, or ak@s, as in 14.50, and in commands, as in 14.95 and
14.145. The four forms appear fully synonymous.","[357, 358, 359]"

These negative strategies conﬁrm the connection between questions and negation in Manambu, corroborating an etymological link between the negative and the interrogative ata
(§14.3).14.7 s ummary
Manambu has a complex system of expressing negation. Only predicates can be negated; and if
a non-predicate constituent has to be negated, this is achieved by making it into an independent
predicate head. A limited variability of the scope of negation is found with the general negator
ma: in non-future declarative clauses only. A summary is in Tables 14.2–3.
Numerous categories are neutralized under negation. These include the following.
(i) Dependent clause types: in positive polarity Manambu has seven types of medial dependent clauses (see §18.1), juxtaposed dependent clauses, and relative clauses; of these, one
(‘unlikely condition’) cannot be negated, and all the rest except for one (the ‘in case’ conditional
clause) are negated in the same way, with the dependent negator -ma:r-.

polarity operates in the language.
(ii) Person, number, and gender are neutralized in declarative non-habitual negative clauses.
Negation is instrumental in providing a distinction between relative clauses, juxtaposed
clauses, and main clauses. In positive polarity, these types are distinguished by intonation only.
Negation distinguishes future from irrealis forms. The existing link between questions
(conceived as underlyingly dependent structures) and dependent clauses surfaces only under
negation.
Three prohibitives diﬀer in their strength, and in a number of morphosyntactic properties
(see Table 14.1). These correspond to just one positive imperative, and a variety of imperative
strategies.
The negation of desiderative involves a marker which is possibly of an interrogative origin.
This may have its basis in a tendency to use questions in lieu of negative structures throughout
the language.","[362, 363, 364]"

‘Those men’s houses, those men’s houses which stay in that (topical) inland village, I will
enumerate them (topical) again’
In 10.54, a cross-referenced constituent referred to with a reactivated topic demonstrative is
someone with respect to whom the action is performed. Examples of this sort indicate that the
reactivated topic demonstratives operate predominantly, but not exclusively, on an S/O basis.
Alternatively, they can be described as operating on a non-A basis. As illustrated in 10.68, a
clause can contain two occurrences of reactivated topic demonstratives, but never more than
that.
The reactivated topic demonstratives do not appear to form one NP with the noun they refer
to. They agree with this noun in gender and number, but can never take any cases or suﬃxes
or be arguments of postpositions. There can be an intonation break between a demonstrative
and an NP it refers to (as in 10.68)—something atypical for an NP. Within a clause, they tend
to occur immediately preceding the verb (or the complex adverb+verb, as in 10.68). If the
constituent they refer to has a contrastive overtone, they follow it, as in 10.62. We will see,
in §20.1.1, that Manambu is not averse to split NPs; however, they are never split between
clauses.
In terms of spatial reference, the demonstrative stems employed in reactivated topic demonstratives have similar overtones to the nominal spatio-temporal demonstratives (§10.2.1, under
A). In 10.69, the ‘close to addressee’ demonstrative is used to refer to the names of men’s houses
which were enumerated for my (addressee’s) beneﬁt (just as in 10.25 above).

The last occurrence of aka (dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg) in aka kus@-na combines reference
to the O (‘story’) and to the action of telling itself: it supplies an aspectual overtone of ‘here
and now; ongoing action’ to a verb marked with action focus. Similar examples are under 10.56
and 10.78. We return to this in §12.1 and in §12.8.3 (C).
When reactivated topic demonstratives appear as predicate heads, they take the predicative marker -n followed by -a- and by gender-number agreement marker -@ka, e.g. k@ka-naka (dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg) ‘this feminine singular (reactivated
topic) is’, often used as a summary statement, ‘this is how it is, this is how things are’. Its
distal demonstrative counterpart is often used in a similar way, meaning ‘so, this is how
it is’:22210 Closed Classes10.70 aw [k@-l-@m

In 10.71 (the end of Sepaywus’s recital of the names of men’s houses in Avatip), a plural
reactivated topic demonstrative heads the predicate. The gender and number agreement with
the subject is thus marked twice.

‘The men’s houses belonging to that village inland are those ones (topical)’
To conclude: reactivated topic demonstratives agree with a cross-linguistic tendency for
preferred argument structure whereby a topical element is never introduced in the A function. They are typologically quite unusual in that they combine reference to the constituent’s
topicality, its grammatical relation, and its position in space. The latter makes them somewhat
redundant, given that they often occur in the same clause as nominal demonstratives with the
same spatial reference.10.3 i ndefinites
Manambu has two indeﬁnites, with the meaning ‘other, another’. The agreeing modiﬁer fem.sg.
n@k@, masc.sg. n@k@-d@, dual n@k@-b@r , plural n@k@-di ‘another, other’ (see §5.1.1) refers to
another, additional and diﬀerent, participant, e.g. n@k@ ñ@ (another+fem.sg day) ‘next day,
another day’ and in 10.53 (’another story’). It can refer to ‘one’ and ‘another’ (members of a
pair), as in 10.55, or to several choices, as in 10.52. This example contains six occurrences of
n@k@ corresponding to the number of smoking grids in the spirit’s house. This pronoun can
also refer to an indeterminate location or time, or referent: n@k@ ñ@ (another+fem.sg day) can
mean ‘next day, another day’ (then its synonym is kwap@k ‘next day’). Or it can mean ‘some
other day, whenever’. This same pronoun may refer to additional objects, e.g. ‘two more plates’
as in 10.72.
10.72 n@k@-b@r plet viti akray!
other-du plate two impv+bring
‘Bring two more plates!’ (lit. two other plates)
The pronoun ‘other, another’ carries with it a distinct overtone of something undesirable
and potentially dangerous. In 10.3 above, ‘another man’, or a ‘stranger’ is a trespasser. A
similar example is 8.12 (the gist of it is that other people’s cats are strangers and do nothing
but damage).
The feminine locative form of the indefinite n@k@- ‘other, another’, n@k@m, means ‘halfheartedly; not fully’:10.3 Indeﬁnites22310.73 gura:m

This form can be repeated as n@k@m n@k@m (another.fem.sg+loc another.fem.sg+loc) ‘bit of

manner modiﬁer to the verb. In 21.44, repetition of n@k@m means ‘wherever’.

The pronoun n@k@- is usually employed as a prehead modiﬁer; only occasionally can its
head be omitted. In contrast, the indeﬁnite n@w@k ‘(an)other one’ is used only as a head. It can
be modiﬁed with nominal demonstratives, but, unlike any other nominal, does not take case
marking. It can have a singular referent, as in 10.76. It is in O function, but is not marked for
case.

n@k@- and n@w@k. The meaning of ‘someone; one . . . another’ can be achieved by using the
numeral ‘one’ (see §10.6). Repetition of a noun has a distributive indeﬁnite meaning, e.g. ag@k
‘one of the two sides’, ag@k ag@k ‘one side to the other’, tab@k ‘end of, side’, tab@k t@b@k ‘one
side and another’.10.4 i n t e r ro gat i v e s
Content questions are marked with a question word and slightly rising intonation, while
polar questions are marked by intonation only. Interrogative clauses are discussed in §20.1.3.
A question word does not have a ﬁxed position in a clause; like any constituent, if it is in
contrastive focus it tends to occupy the clause-initial position and acquire focus marking.
Interrogatives form a heterogeneous class in terms of their meanings, syntactic function,
focus marking, and grammatical categories. Interrogatives include nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
and quantiﬁers. There are no interrogative verbs. Manambu employs the following interrogative stems:
(i) s@- ‘who; whose’;
(ii) agwa- ‘what, which’;
(iii) ak@- ‘where; belonging to where; when’;
(iv) akr@l ‘where to’;
(v) agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’;
(vi) ata, ata ata, at@ta, atawa, at@tawa, at@taka, k@t@taka ‘how’; and
(vii) kas ‘how many/much; which (by number)’.
(i) The pronoun s@ ‘who’ has human reference, and can be used as an argument, as head of
predicate, and as a possessive modiﬁer (‘whose’). It takes all cases, except for transportatives
and substitutive. Unlike nouns, it cannot take any modiﬁer. As shown in §7.1, this form behaves
similarly to third person non-plural personal pronouns in that it takes a linker -k@-, as shown
in 10.79 (see §7.9 on the form of the comitative with ‘who’).

‘Who are you staying with, in this village?’
Unlike a personal pronoun, it cannot be reduplicated. A constituent in a medial completive
clause can be questioned, as in 10.80 and 9.33. This is one of the properties of these clauses
which diﬀerentiates them from other types, especially relative and conditional clauses (see
Chapter 19). The interrogative ‘who’ in 10.80 is in dative case, required by the verb ‘ask’ (lit.
‘ﬁrst plant’):

‘Who did you ask when you brought her here?’ (lit. having asked who did you bring it
(here)?)
When used as a possessive modiﬁer, s@ takes the oblique marker -k@- and agrees in gender
and number with the possessee, as in 10.81.","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251]"
"13.6 Frustrative29313.6 f rus t rat i v e
Frustrative indicates that the action was done to no avail—that is, the desired result was not
achieved. Frustrative is an uninﬂected verb, but, unlike other uninﬂected verbs, frustrative
makes a distinction between durative and non-durative action. Durative frustrative is marked
with the suﬃx -p on the verb stem and repetition of the frustrative form. This indicates that the
action which failed to achieve the result took place over a lengthy period of time—as in 13.66.
The form can be repeated from two to ﬁve times, but hardly ever more than that. The more
times the form is repeated, the lengthier the failed attempt is supposed to be. The repeated
frustrative-marked verbs form one intonation unit, and no other constituent can intervene
between them.
A clause containing a frustrative form is typically accompanied by another clause indicating
either why the action failed, as in 13.66, or what was done after it failed, as in 13.67 and T3.31.

‘(He) pulled and pulled and pulled (the canoe out of mud) in vain, it was hard’
Like any uninﬂected verb, the durative frustrative can only occur in a dependent clause as a
copula complement of t@-, as in 13.67 and T3.29. Then there is only one copula no matter how
many times the durative frustrative form is repeated—this is an argument in favour of treating
the durative frustrative as one predicate, and not as repetition of several predicates:

‘The father went up into the house, having sat and sat and sat and sat waiting in vain,
having said, “oh”, he went down’
The non-durative frustrative is marked with -yak@p. This form contains no indication as to
how long the frustrated attempt had lasted. The form is usually not repeated. We can recall,
from §2.4.2, that -yak@p is syllable-weight sensitive. If a verb root has a CV(C)V, a CVC, or a
CCV/CVC structure, the form of the marker is -yak@p, as in kwak@-yak@p (look.for-fr) ‘look
for in vain’, kayket@-yak@p ‘hold onto something in vain’, gra-yak@p ‘cry in vain’. If a verb
consists of a CV, the frustrative suﬃx undergoes initial CVCV reduplication, as in ya-yak@yak@p (come-red-fr) ‘come in vain’, v@-yak@-yak@p ‘look in vain; be unable to see’. The verb
v@- ‘see’ is unusual in that it has an alternative non-durative frustrative form v@-k@tak@p—this
is illustrated below. This alternative form ﬁts in with the iambic stress pattern characteristic of
weight-sensitive suﬃxes—see §2.4.2.

action of calling and getting no answer is repeated in diﬀerent clauses, to show that this was
done twice.

If a verb contains -ya ‘come’ as the last syllable, the frustrative -yak@p is ‘shortened’ to -k@p,
as in 13.71. Such haplology is unusual.

Like any uninﬂected verb, a frustrative -yak@p can only be used in a dependent clause as a
copula complement:

‘Having looked for me in vain, having packed my things, by entering (inside the bush)
they hid them together with their things’
The two frustrative markers may well be etymologically related: they share the formative -p.
We can hypothesize that -yak@- in -yak@p could be related to -yak@- ‘do fully’ (see §15.3.1), and
that -k@ta- in v@-k@tak@p could be linked to -k@ta- ‘try’, as in k@-k@ta ‘try eating’. However,
these hypotheses require further substantiation.
Unlike the other modal forms discussed so far, neither of the frustratives can be negated.13.7 no m i na l i zat i o n s m a r k e d w i t h dat i v e -av e r s i v e c a s e
We saw in §9.1.1 (under II) that deverbal nominalizations marked with the dative-aversive case
-Vk express a variety of modal meanings to do with future projection, unrealized wishes, weak
probability, or events to be prevented from happening. When used in the predicate slot, these
nominalizations behave like any uninﬂected verb; examples are at 13.73–5.

In 13.74, the ﬁrst occurrence of dative-aversive-marked nominalization expresses a wish. This
is a typical meaning of the dative-aversive case (see §7.4). The second occurrence of dativeaversive-marked nominalization is ambiguous: we recall, from §13.4.1, that these forms are13.7 Nominalizations with dative-aversive case295used in lieu of same-subject purposives with monosyllabic verbs. This is why the form kwakwak
(as in T3.40, third line, and 13.74) can be interpreted either as a dative-aversive nominalization,
meaning ‘might stay’, or as same-subject purposive, meaning ‘going to stay’. The ambiguity
can be resolved by the context, and under negation (see §14.3).

Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used as clausal complements in contexts which
would require the dative-aversive case on a noun phrase. These include verbs with a negative
meaning, e.g. ‘feel shame’, as in 9.6, ‘say no’, or ‘forbid, refuse’, as in 9.5 and 13.78 (cf. also
10.35), ‘forget’, as in 13.79, ‘be diﬃcult’, as in 9.9 and 13.80, and ‘be unwilling’ (lit. go for

something ominous and unpleasant—as in 13.84–5, and 9.8:

A dative-aversive nominalization on its own may have an apprehensive meaning, just like
dative-aversive case forms (see §7.4):
13.86 kiya-kiya-k
die-red-dat
‘(Do not go there) lest you die!’
The aversive use of dative-aversive-marked nominalizations in main clauses is another
instance of desubordination of verb forms which are predominantly used in dependent clauses.
In all the cases discussed above, dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations occupy the
second argument slot of a verb. They can also occupy the S slot of a non-verbal predicate
with a negative meaning, as shown in 13.87. This sentence states a convention concerning
men’s road and women’s road in Avatip. (A corresponding positive statement would require a
ø-marked nominalization: see §9.1.1.) A noun phrase marked with dative-aversive case cannot
be used this way. Examples like 13.87 oﬀer an argument in favour of considering fully reduplicated verbs marked with the suﬃx -k as separate modal forms which are homonymous, rather
than polysemous, with a dative-aversive (-Vk) case form of a deverbal action nominalization.","[319, 320, 321, 322, 323]"

is duami abun (twenty six); seventy is duami ab@ti (twenty seven), eighty is duami abumugul
(twenty eight), and ninety is duami aba:li (twenty nine). Each of these forms has a parallel in
Iatmul of Korogo where doublet forms were also attested, e.g. du-mi ainak (man-? four) and
du-mi viti (man-? two) ‘forty’, du-mi sila kita (man-? ? six) and du-mi kuvuk (man-? three) ‘sixty’,
and so on.
The alternative term for ‘hundred’ in Manambu is duamir duamir tab@ti (twenty+instr
twenty+instr ten), which is somewhat similar but not fully parallel to Iatmul du-mi taba vli
(man-? hand two=ten) (Jendraschek, p.c.).
Another alternative form for forty was duamir duamir a:li (twenty+instr twenty+instr
four). This was discarded as an error by most speakers who said that this means ‘row of
twenties’. Another alternative is duamir viti (twenty+instr two) ‘forty’. In 10.149 below, duami
viti and duamir viti were used interchangeably. Occasionally, a forty-based system was attested,
as in duamir n@ sa:p tab@ti mæn nak (twenty+instr one and ten leg one) ‘ﬁfty-one’ (lit. one
forty and eleven). This was used by just one speaker (who had used duami viti and then duamir
viti for ‘forty’ in the previous sentence, in 10.149). Since the term in Tok Pisin almost always
accompanies such lengthy numbers, there are hardly ever any misunderstandings.
The following forms have been cited for numbers over 100:
duami tab@ti (twenty ten) ‘200’,
duami tab@ti mana:b (twenty ten leg+too) ‘300’,
duamir duamir duami nak (twenty+instr twenty+instr twenty one) ‘400’,
duamir duamir duami nak mana:b (twenty+instr twenty+instr twenty one leg+too) ‘500’,
duamir duamir duami nak mana:b n@mn@m nak ‘600’;

duamir duamir duami nak mana:b n@mn@m a:li ‘900’, and
duamir duamir duami nak mana:b n@mn@m taba:b ‘1000’.
Numbers over 100 are hardly ever used.
The Manambu people are ‘number-proud’. Knowledge of high numbers is considered a
valuable token of expertise in the language. At present, Tok Pisin numbers (which are easier
to handle and to remember) are used in everyday life, especially those from eleven onwards.
Higher numbers occur in traditional stories, or when a speaker wishes to display their expertise,
especially if the context involves traditional counting contexts. These include counting one’s
ancestors, counting the number of enemies killed in battle, and counting shell valuables. In
10.148, from the story about how the Vali:k clan was founded (similar to Text 2), high numbers
are used to compare the prowess of the two men.

High numbers, whenever they are used, are likely to be accompanied by translations into
Tok Pisin, since the speakers are never conﬁdent that their audience really understands these.
In 10.149, the speaker made sure he translated the numbers; however, he himself used two
diﬀerent forms for ‘forty’:

Numbers higher than ten are postposed to the head noun, or occur in split noun phrases (as
in 10.148), or without a head noun, as in 10.149. Manambu has a word for number, paki; the
verb for counting nas- can also mean ‘enumerate’, or ‘list’ (as in 10.68). A full account and an

Closed classes in Manambu diﬀer in terms of several major parameters: (i) whether they
can occur as heads of noun phrases; (ii) whether they can occur as prehead or as posthead10.7 Closed Classes: An Overview243Table 10.11 Properties of closed classes: a comparison

nomodiﬁers, (iii) whether they can take case marking; and (iv) whether they allow overt marking
of number and gender. These are partly summarized in Table 10.11.
Further grammatical subclasses can be established within each particular class. We saw
above that reactivated topic demonstratives behave diﬀerently from any other demonstratives
(or any other classes in the language) in that they take a predicative marker -n followed by
a-gender-number-ka when focused or when used as predicate heads. Current relevance demonstratives have no gender and number marking, in contrast to spatio-temporal demonstratives
which do.","[267, 268, 269, 270]"
"20.4.3 Ellipsis
Being elaborate and precise is a skill highly appreciated for story tellers and orators in the
Manambu speech communities. In contrast, day-to-day speech is highly elliptical. If a noun
phrase is recoverable from the context, it won’t be overtly mentioned. In 20.36a and 20.36b
the referents of the full pronouns were obvious (‘me’ and ‘you feminine’), so they did not
have to be stated. And we saw that in 20.41 the subject was omitted—also because it is clear
from the context. In 8.4 only the gender agreement shows that the possessed noun ‘house’ has
been omitted. This was Yipawal’s answer to my question ‘Where is your house?’ The reply
was, literally, ‘I this one (masculine)’. Further possibilities of ellipsis are illustrated with the
following snippets of dialogue.
Consider 20.92–3. The sentence under a is a question, and b is an answer to it. The question
in 20.92a is itself elliptical: we were talking about some women going to Maprik to sell ﬁsh, so
this part is not stated:
20.92a s@-k@-dadi
yi-k-na-di?
who-obl-3pl+3plnom go-fut-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Who is going (to Maprik to sell ﬁsh)?’ (lit. Who are going?)
The idea of the answer in 20.92b is that the speaker was going to ﬁnd out who was going and
then give them money to buy her some hair cream:
20.92b kwak@-ku
kui-k@-tua-di
ﬁnd-compl.ss give.to.third.p-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
‘Having found (them), I will give (it: money) to them’20.4 Further issues in discourse organization547In 20.93a, the speaker asks the guest whether he’d come from Yawabak on foot. Note the
absence of the overt pronoun: it is omitted, since the cross-referencing on the inﬂected verb
conveys who the subject is:
20.93a n@b@-say
ya-na-d@m@n?
dry.ground+lk-transp come-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
‘Have you come on foot?’ (lit. via dry ground)
The addressee replies, omitting the main verb. The dependent clause is postposed to the
elliptical main clause (which consists just of the instrument, ‘with a canoe’), as a clariﬁcation:
the speaker wants the audience to know that he came all the way just paddling (and therefore
is tired and wouldn’t mind refreshments).
20.93b [vala-r@b]
[gus
kan]
canoe+lk-fully paddle paddle+seq
‘Straight with a canoe, paddling a paddle’
The main verb can only be omitted if it has been introduced in the preceding discourse.
For instance, if A says wali-kamna:gw ak@s k@-kwa-na (white.people-food neg.hab eat-habact.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she never eats white people’s food’, B is likely to add wun-aba:b ak@s
(I-too neg.hab) ‘I too never’. The latter clause would not make sense on its own, taken out
of context. In 20.94—an example of a desubordinated clause, similar to 19.113b—both object
and verb have been omitted from the second clause:
buk al@-da:m
taka-ku
wun api:m
20.94 d@-k@
he-poss+fem.sg book dem.dist+fem.sg-down+loc put-compl.ss I
top+loc
‘I have put his notebook underneath, and mine on top’ (lit. having put)
Elliptical clauses are very frequent in informal interaction. We saw in §19.9 how desubordinated clauses—which can be considered the result of conventionalized ellipsis—are employed
as command strategies. An elliptic clause can be used as a command, with a particularly strong
illocutionary force (similar to desubordinated medial clauses in Table 19.5), e.g. ap k@ka (bone
dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg) ‘This bone!’ meaning ‘Put this bone here (or put it down) (or
else)!’
Instead of producing a full clause, as in 7.29, people would just shout: ak@m t@-ku?
(where+loc stay-compl.ss) ‘where (are you/(s)he/they) coming from?’ And we can recall that
just one word, marked with dative, is enough to verbalize an impending threat: Tanina would
shout diya:k (shit+lk+dat) ‘(beware) of (dog’s) shit’, and I would know to watch my step.
Along similar lines, a reciprocal marker was omitted in 14.114, since the sentence can only
have a reciprocal reading.
If a support verb, or an auxiliary, is easy to supply, it can also be omitted, as in 20.95–6, and
in 17.49–50—this latter was uttered by an angry speaker immediately on entering our house
one Saturday. The context was clear; and the form luku only occurs with the verb kur- —so no
ambiguity could possibly arise. A similar example is at 20.95a: the support verb which occurs
with sua:l is either kur- or taka-; so it appears to be easily omissible in a quick dialogue (from
a story):
20.95a [ñ@n
sua:l kur-ñ@n-@k]
[wa-l@-k]
[ka
you.fem lie
do-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf say-3fem.sg-compl.ds dem.prox.fem.sg
wun sua:l ma:]
I
lie
neg
‘ “You are lying (lit. doing a lie)”, she having said, (the other said), “no! (lit. this!), I am
not lying (lit. I a lie not)” ’54820 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesThe last clause without ellipsis would be rendered as in 20.95b (the ellided word is underlined,
here and in the further examples in this section):
20.95b wun sua:l ma: kwa:r
I
lie
neg do+neg
‘I am not lying’ (lit. I am not doing a lie)
Along similar lines, mak@n ‘be in mourning’ can be omitted from a complex predicate with
kwa-ya- (stay-come), as in 20.96a. This verb is typically used in combination with ‘mourning’.
The aﬀected participant is overtly expressed and the context states that he or she had indeed
died. This makes ‘mourning’ recoverable from the context, and thus dispensable.
20.96a [kiya-d@-k]
[ya:kya] [d@-k@-k
kwa-ya-di]
die-3masc.sg-compl:ds OK
he-obl-dat stay-come-3plbas.p
‘After he’d died, OK, (his relatives) stayed (in mourning) for him’
The full clause, without ellipsis, would be:
mak@n

20.96b [kiya-d@-k]
[ya:kya] [d@-k@-k
die-3masc.sg-compl:ds OK
he-obl-dat in.mourning stay-come-3plbas.p
‘After he’d died, OK, (his relatives) stayed in mourning for him’
If a support verb is omitted from the main clause, and the clause takes part in the bridging
repetition (or ‘head-tail’) linkage, only the support verb gets repeated in the following medial
clause. This is a frequent feature of any narrative, not just of a conversation. An example is at
20.97a. A pause indicates that there is a clause boundary.
20.97a [yi:n

dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘As it went on and on, the night ﬁnished completely. It having ﬁnished, OK, he
remained’
The same sentence without ellipsis is at 20.97b.

kwa-na-d]
stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘As it went on and on, the night ﬁnished completely. It having ﬁnished, OK, he
remained’
The support verb here is uniquely identiﬁable because this is the only one that can occur
with uninﬂected completive aspect (see §17.2)—so there is no need to state it in the main clause.
Neither is there any need to repeat the complement of the support verb since it has just been
mentioned.
Any support verb can be omitted in the same way. We recall, from 17.39–40, that a nominal
m@k@m@k ‘silent’ takes a support verb r@- ‘sit’ or t@- ‘stand, be’. In narratives of any kind it
often occurs on its own, without a support verb, as in 20.98a:20.4 Further issues in discourse organization54920.98a [ada

A version without ellipsis is at 20.98b:

This is the only type of ellipsis pervasive in any type of discourse.
A lexical verb can be omitted from clauses with the generic completive napa- (see §18.9)
if understood within the given context. The fact that the child had ﬁnished staying there is
understood—there is nothing else the child was supposed to do after he’d been put there. The
elliptical clause is underlined. Its unelided form would have been kwa-n napa-d@-k (stay-seq
compl.vb-3masc.sg-compl.ds).

‘We then used to carry that child together, having carried (him), we put him down (lit.
having put her by carrying down), OK, after he’d completed (staying there), we take him
and put him (there) carrying (him)’
Switch-reference (diﬀerent subject marking in the clause with napa-) helps track the referents.
Note that this is an example of a mismatch in gender agreement (see §5.2.2). The masculine
child is small, and so is referred to with the feminine form of the demonstrative; but it is male,
and so is cross-referenced with the masculine singular on the verb.
Even a part of a ﬁxed expression can be omitted, if the speaker chooses to do so. As can be
seen from the endings of the three texts at the end of this grammar (T1.35, T2.69, and T3.53),
when a story ﬁnishes, it ‘goes inside the base’. One very long story that the speaker chose to
tell several times ended with:
20.100a gabu-maj
wula-d
aka
traditional-story come.inside-3masc.sgbas.p dem.prox.react.top+fem.sg
‘The (long) traditional story is over’ (lit. goes inside)
What he could have said, had he not chosen to be elliptical, is:
20.100b gabu-ma:j
maw@r
wula-d
traditional-story base+lk+all come.inside-3masc.sgbas.p
aka
dem.prox.react.top+fem.sg
‘The (long) traditional story is over’ (lit. goes inside the base)55020 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesSuch omissions are indicative of speakers who are less careful in how they lay out their
narratives. And it is perhaps not a coincidence that speakers who tend to be elliptical are not
among the most eloquent orators. That is, Manambu discourse presents a curious combination
of both explicitness and ellipsis. This is comparable to the structure and use of the lexicon—
which also combines a high degree of precision with the ever-present option of using a generic
term. This is the topic of our next chapter.","[573, 574, 575, 576, 577]"
"1587 Case MarkingA suﬃx of the same form appears in manner adverbs (§4.4), where it is often accompanied by
reduplication, e.g. m@y-a-m@y-a:b (real-lk-real-lk+term) ‘for real, fully well and truly’.7.7 t ra n s p o rtat i v e c a s e s
Two transportative cases occur with a limited group of nouns, and are similar in their meanings.
The markers are -Vsap and -Vsay; both are used with nouns referring to means of locomotion
or of reaching a destination. Their meaning overlaps with the instrumental -Vr (see §7.5). The
form -say appears to be more frequent than -sap. See 7.60–1.
ya-na-wun

ya:l
car-lk+transp come/go+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘That dead mother of them two then came by car’
The sentence in 7.61 is followed by 7.62, where the meaning ‘by car’ is marked with the
allative-instrumental. This shows similarity in meanings of the allative and the transportative:
waku-n]
ata p@una-l
mat@mat-@-m
7.62 [kar-a:l
car-lk+all go.out-seq then appear-3fem.sgbas.vt cemetery-lk-loc
‘Going out by car, she appeared at the cemetery’
The marker -say can also be used with locations such as waterways used as means of getting
from one place to another, as in 7.63:
7.63 alawur
Kabla-say
da:d
dem.dist.fem.sg+up Screw.River+lk-transp go.down+3masc.sgbas.vt
‘He went down from up there via Screw River’
Both markers can be used with other means of getting from one place to another: one
can say yab-@-say or yab-@-sap ‘by road’, n@b-@-say or n@b-@-sap ‘by dry land’. With some
words, only -say was considered acceptable and produced spontaneously: p@takau-say (laddertransp) was judged to be synonymous with p@takaur (ladder+instr) ‘by ladder’; but ∗p@takausap was rejected. The marker -say was also used on an interrogative, in 7.64; -sap was judged
strange in this context. The answer was: with a ladder. An alternative would have been agw-a:r
(what/which-lk+instr) ‘with what, how?’
da-u
7.64 wun ak@-say
what/where-transp go.down-1sgimpv
I
‘How (lit. with which means) shall I go down?’
Neither case can occur on personal pronouns or demonstratives. There is a lookalike -sap
used with one word, yanu ‘magic’; yanu-sap means ‘by way of or through magic’. Whether the
two are related or not is an open question. According to the intuition of some speakers, they
are homonyms.","[184, 185]"
"4.5.1 Modal words
Modal words are a small closed class, which consists of two members, b@nak and n@b@ ‘be
able to, can’. Both form a complex predicate with an inﬂected verb in the indicative mood (see
§20.1.2). They are not inﬂected, cannot be negated, or questioned, or appear in a command;
neither do they appear in any of the modalities discussed in Chapter 13. Both have an epistemic
meaning of a potential. The form b@nak appears to be rarer than n@b@ and is always followed
by a verb inﬂected for person, number, and gender of the subject, as in 4.64. It occurs clauseinitially.
4.64 b@nak val
suku-k@-tua
capable canoe carve-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I can carve a canoe’
The form n@b@ does not have to occur clause-initially. It always precedes the inﬂected verb.
It can be accompanied by a verb inﬂected for third person singular feminine (basic set). Such1044 Word Classesa form can have a generic subject, as in pap@r n@b@ val (a.little.later.on able see+3fem.sgbas.vt)
‘one can see later’. The use of feminine cross-referencing here goes together with the functionally unmarked character of feminine in Manambu—see §5.2.3. Depending on the context, such
an expression can be understood as ‘we’, or ‘you’.
When Tanina said to me s@r n@b@ kwatiya-l (tomorrow able give.to.nonthird.p3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘one can give (this to me) tomorrow’, it was clear from the context that I was
the giver. Similarly, 5.27 refers to two people (‘us’) writing together. The referent of the subject
can be speciﬁed, by adding an NP, as in 4.65, or a personal pronoun, as in 4.66.
4.65 pap@r
Jag@r n@b@ val
little.later Jager able see+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘A little later Jager can see (what’s wrong with the machine)’
4.66 b@r
n@b@ wula-l
you.two able come.in-3fem.sgbas.vt
‘The two of you can come in’
This construction does not appear to be used with ﬁrst person singular subject. The second
alternative is to employ a verb form fully inﬂected for person, number, and gender. Then, there
are no restrictions as to the person of the subject—the ﬁrst person subject is shown in the ﬁrst
clause of 15.53.
In summary: the modal words form one complex predicate with an inﬂected verb (allowing
for two options of inﬂection). They cannot take any inﬂection themselves, or be used in any
other syntactic function, and can only occur in positive declarative clauses. (The negative
counterpart would be a copula clause with suan yi- (as in 4.7).) This makes them diﬀerent
from any other word class in the language.","[130, 131]"
"20.2 Constituent order535This S/O, or, better, non-A, basis for reactivated topic markers has a pragmatic basis. It
agrees with a cross-linguistic tendency for a correlation between the non-A function (typically,
an S/O function) and introducing a new participant (Du Bois 1987). To put it simply: new
participants tend to be introduced in S/O function, but hardly ever in the A function.
This principle in Manambu has interesting repercussions for the variations in constituent
order, and for the highlighting focus construction. There is a strong preference for non-As to
occur in a postverbal position reserved for unexpected and relatively new information and clariﬁcation (see §20.2). An A constituent hardly ever occurs in highlighting focus constructions
reserved for new information (see §20.3).20.2 c o n s t i t u e n t o r d e r: i t s s y n tac t i c a n d p rag m at i c m o t i vat i o n s
Constituent order in Manambu is predominantly verb ﬁnal in main clauses, and almost exclusively so in dependent clauses (see Tables 19.1 and 20.1). This is consistent with a verb-ﬁnal
tendency advocated as typical of languages with clause chaining and switch-reference.
However, this is not a steadfast rule. One Sunday in early 2002 Ken Nayau, the major
consultant working with SIL missionaries Robin and Marva Farnsworth, was visiting his native
Avatip. He burst into Yuamali’s house where we were having a mid-afternoon snack to ask me
an urgent question: ‘What is a verb-ﬁnal order?’ I explained, using a mixture of Manambu,
Tok Pisin, and English, what this is supposed to mean (it is not an easy task to say ‘verb’ in
Manambu, or to talk about linguistics in general). ‘You put your verb at the end of what you
say.’ ‘Yes’, replied Ken, ‘this is what Robin told me it means. But we do not speak like that.’
And indeed, not all clauses in Manambu end with a verb. (In the corpus, about 15–20
per cent do not.) There are a number of principles which allow for non-verb-ﬁnal orders in
the language.
The general principle of ordering words and constituents in Manambu involves placing new
and less topically established participants ﬁrst. Participants tend to be introduced as O (as can
be seen in T1.1 and T2.1), or in a verbless clause (as in T1.3 which may be translated as ‘(There
was) a young man and a woman’), or as an S of a non-verbal clause (as in T2.3). In a transitive
clause, the order is typically AOV, as in 20.68a. An overt A does not have to be expressed at
all; but it is likelier to be expressed if the predicate is a non-inﬂecting verb as in 20.68a–b (also
see 7.5).
20.68a wun m@n-a:m
vi
ma:
I
you.masc-lk+acc/loc hit+neg neg
‘I will not hit you’
An OAV order implies that the O is contrastive, new, and unexpected, as in 20.68b:
ma:
20.68b m@n-a:m
wun vi
you.masc-lk+acc/loc I
hit+neg neg
‘I will not hit you’ (implying that I may hit someone else)
Placing an O before an A is so unusual that if the clause is to be repeated in a ‘head-tail’
bridging structure (see §20.4), the A is also repeated. Note that the O is not case marked,
despite being a personal name: this O is a new participant never mentioned in the story again,
and case marking is associated with topicality—see §7.3.","[561, 562]"
"14.5.1 Negating dependent clauses
A verbal predicate of a dependent clause of any of the types described in Chapters 18–19 is
negated with the suﬃx -ma:r-. There are two exceptions: a repetitive clause marked with the
suﬃx -k@k@b is never negated; the corresponding meaning is partly conveyed by using habitual
negative in a juxtaposed clause, as in 14.124. An irrealis conditional clause marked with -ga:y
is never negated, and has no simple negative counterpart (see §18.8).
A manner sequential clause whose predicate is marked with the suﬃx -@n is illustrated at
14.109. We will see, in §18.1, that -(@)n-marked clauses have a wide range of meanings, covering
time (‘while’), as in 14.109, and reason (‘as, because’), as in 14.110. The resulting form is
uninﬂected. An -n clause can either precede or follow the main clause.

14.110 [s@
sleep stay-neg.sub-seq ear put.down-hab-1plbas.vt
‘Not sleeping (as we are not sleeping) we keep eavesdropping’
A complex predicate consisting of a verb marked with -@n and an auxiliary t@- (see §17.1.1)
can be negated in two ways, with diﬀerent meanings. If the auxiliary is negated, as in 14.32–3,
this implies anterior reading—implying that something has or has not happened in the past
and this is relevant for the moment of speech. Alternatively, the -@n form of the verb can be
negated, e.g. s@kul@k yarakara yi-y@ laku-mar-@n ta:l (cooking well go-red know-neg:sub-seq
stay+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘She did not know how to cook properly’. The implication is that of a
complete lack of experience whose general relevance goes beyond the moment of speech.
A desubordinated manner sequential clause occurs in questions (in 14.132)—we return to
this in §14.5.3.
A negated same-subject completive clause is illustrated in 14.111. A desubordinated samesubject completive clause can be used in a question (at 14.133)—see §14.5.3.",[352]

Given that akr@l ‘where to’, discussed below, cannot occupy a focus position, the focused
interrogative ak@m-aka-n@r (where-foc.m-lk+all) ‘exactly where to?’ can be considered its
suppletive focus form. The etymology of akr@l is not fully clear. This form appears to contain
the root ak@- ‘locative interrogative’ followed by -Vr which could be the allative marker; the
ﬁnal -l could well be another instance of the allative marker which has undergone rhotic
dissimilation (A1 under §2.6). A similar allative form has been occasionally heard for the
proximate demonstrative kr@l (dem.prox+fem.sg+all) ‘to here’ (see 12.18).
(v) The interrogative agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’ is used to enquire about someone in
general, and often has negative overtones. When a mentally deranged woman came into our
house and sat down, no one was pleased to see her. The mistress of the house asked her, in an
annoyed tone of voice:
10.98 ñ@n
agula?
you.fem what’s.up/why
‘What are you about? Why are you here?’
Similarly, a man was behaving in a peculiar way trying to hide from what he thought was an
evil spirit; his wife came in and said: m@n agula? (you.masc what’s.up/why) ‘what’s happening?
what’s wrong with you?’ This same form is used to question the reason of something unpleasant, or unusual. Another example is under 10.99. This was said to a child who was crying out
of spite, and not because anyone did anything to her:10.4 Interrogatives229gra-na-ñ@n?
10.99 agula
what’s.up/why cry-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
‘Why on earth are you crying?’
The etymology and the structure of agula is obscure. It probably contains the root agwa‘what, which’ and an additional formative.
(vi) The ways of questioning the manner in which something has been performed are ata,
ata ata, at@ta ‘how’. The form ata is polysemous with the manner demonstrative discussed in
10.2.2. Both ata and its repeated version ata ata are used to question someone’s physical state,
as in 10.100, speech reports, as in 10.101 (see §19.5), and names, as in 10.102:
10.100 m@n
ata ata
you.masc how how
‘How are you? What’s happening to you?’
10.101 ata ata wa-na?
how how say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘What did she say?’
10.102 ata marasin s@?
how medicine name
‘What’s the name of the medicine?’
The diﬀerence in meaning between ata ‘how’ and ata ata is that of emphasis: ata ata can be
translated as ‘exactly what?’ It is often used as an elliptical question, e.g. ata ata ‘what (did you
say)?’ The form ata is not used in such elliptical sentences. When ata occurs as predicate head
or as part of predicate focus, it takes the predicative -n, as in 10.103. The repeated form ata ata
cannot head a predicate or be focused.
10.103 a-d@
wa:y s@
ata-n-ad,
ma:?
dem.dist-masc.sg magic name how-pred-3masc.sgnom again
‘What’s the name of the magic again?’
The interrogative at@ta ‘how’ is used similarly to ata and ata ata, in the meaning of ‘how’,
as in T1.22 (ﬁrst line), from a story about a man who got upset about the moon making his
wife menstruate and decided to kill the moon. Both ata and ata ata were used in other versions
of T1.22. Unlike ata, at@ta is not used in non-interrogative clauses. Unlike both ata and ata
ata, it is not really used to question speech reports—it is used to question the manner of saying
things, including a word or an expression to be used, as in 13.10.
This form often occurs with the same-subject purposive, as in 10.104, and also with the
desiderative, as an emphatic way of stating how impossible it is to do something:
10.104 ma:j at@ta wuk@-k
talk how hear-purp.ss
‘How (am I to) hear the story (if children are screaming)?’
Similarly to ata in 10.102, at@ta can be used as a modiﬁer, ‘which kind of; how’:
10.105 ñ@n
at@ta gwalugw?
you.fem how clan
‘What clan do you belong to?’
Just like ata, at@ta can head a predicate or be in focus; then it takes the predicate marker -n,
as in 10.106:23010 Closed Classes10.106 ñ@n
at@ta-n-añ@n-@k
you.fem how-pred-2fem.sgnom-conf
‘How are you? What’s the matter with you?’
The form at@ta is etymologically connected with ata; possibly, it is the result of fusion of the
repeated ata ata. However, synchronically, these are diﬀerent forms.
Three other forms are occasionally used in the meaning of ‘how’, as full synonyms of at@ta:
at@tawa, at@taka, and k@t@taka (the two latter ones were used by a speaker of the Malu
variety). 4
Two adverbial manner demonstratives can occasionally acquire interrogative meanings,
atawa ‘thus, like that’ (10.107) and ak@tawa ‘like this’ (10.108), with very similar meanings.
Note the form of the negator in this clause: we return to the use of non-main clause negator in
questions in §14.5.
v@-ma:r-ñ@na-l
10.107 atawa
how/like.that see-neg.sub-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
‘How come you didn’t see her?’ (lit. ‘how did it happen that you did not see her?’)
10.108 ak@tawa
k@-k-na-wun-@k
how/like.this eat-fut-act.foc-1sgbas.vt-conf
‘How will I eat (uncooked food)?’
The form ak@tawa in its interrogative use can occur with the locative case, in the same
meaning, ak@tawa-n-@m (how/like.this-pred-lk+loc) ‘how, in what way?’
This polysemy between interrogatives and demonstratives is unique to adverbial manner
demonstratives, and not attested for nominal demonstratives. None of the forms discussed
here is used to enquire about degree—see 10.112 below.
(vii) The interrogative quantiﬁer kas ‘how many/much; which (by number)’ is always postposed
to the noun it quantiﬁes, as shown in 10.109 and 6.43 (countable referent) and in 10.110
(uncountable referent):
10.109 ñ@n
ñan-ugw kas?
you.fem child-pl how.many/much
‘How many children do you have?’
t@-na?
10.110 ñ@ kas
sun how.many/much stay/have-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘What time is it?’ (lit. How much sun is there?)
This quantiﬁer is often used without an accompanying noun where it is obvious from the
context, as in 10.111:
10.111 d@-k@-k
kas
yapi-k@-tua-d?
he-obl-dat how.many/much sell/pay-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘How much shall I pay for him?’
It never occurs in a focus construction. It can be used to enquire about size, with a size noun,
as in 10.112, and about the relative order, as in 10.113.
10.112 s@mi kas?
length how.many/much
‘How long (is the stretch of cloth)?’
4 Farnsworth and Farnsworth (1966) report the use of akata in the meaning of ‘how’; none of my consultants used
this form.","[254, 255, 256, 257]"
"54220 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesWe saw, at §20.1.3 above, that the interrogative pronoun s@ ‘who’ is obligatorily marked for
focus if it occurs in subject function. This is the only instance of grammaticalized focus whose
occurrence is limited to S and A.
Highlighting focus constructions involving arguments and obliques cannot be negated separately. This is hardly surprising: we can recall that a constituent cannot be negated separately,
without the whole clause being negated.
We now turn to a rather unusual construction whose function is to contrast an action, or
a state, to other actions or states. Such ‘predicate focus’ constructions involve marking a fully
inﬂected verb as if it were a non-verbal predicate. Note that they cannot involve a predicate
already marked for action focus (§12.2). (If the predicate in ‘predicate focus’ contains an
uninﬂected verb, it requires a support verb—see §17.2.) In 20.87, the speaker is saying that
what they were going to do was to cut the pig, and not anything else. This is framed as predicate
focus—that is, the whole clause is within the scope of the focus. A similar example is at 11.8.
20.87 [au {k@-d@
bal ra-k@-bana-l}-a]
then dem.prox-masc.sg pig cut-fut-1plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {we are going to cut the pig}’ (rather than doing something else)
‘Predicate focus’ structures produced spontaneously often provide an explanation for an
unusual event or state. When we returned to Avatip from an exhausting trip to Swakap, people
would look askance at my bandaged arms. The answer—provided by Yuaneng—was:
20.88 [{Swakapa:r
yi-ba-l}-a]
Swakap+lk+all go-1plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {we went to Swakap}’ (and got sunburnt and tired)
A distal demonstrative as head of non-verbal predicate can be put in a focus construction,
as a form of a strong statement: a-l-al (dem.dist.fem.sg-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom) ‘this is it’.
It is also used as a conversation sustainer, and as a summarizing statement indicating that the
speaker has ﬁnished one point, and may well start on something else.
Such predicate focus constructions cannot contain reactivated topic demonstratives. Neither
do they occur with a non-predicate-ﬁnal constituent order. This is to do with their pragmatic
organization: the event or the resulting state is viewed as a whole, and is thus contrasted to
another event, the participants being of secondary importance.
The diﬀerence between the English translational equivalents in 20.87–8 and 11.8 and the
Manambu structures is that there is no overt subordination marker in Manambu.
If the predicate in a highlighting focus construction is negated, it takes the subordinate
negator -ma:r-. We can recall, from §14.5.3, that this is indeed the most frequent context under
which a predicate of what looks like an independent clause may occur with -ma:r-. This involves
focusing a negated clause. Examples are at 14.134–5, and 20.89a. What makes life in Swakap
unbearable for the people from Avatip and Malu is that:
20.89a [{kwasa
wi
t@-ma:r-dana-l}-a]
small+fem.sg house have-neg.sub-3plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {they do not have toilet (small house)}’
This brings us back to the issue of whether highlighting focus involves a cleft or not. In
many languages, focus constructions are expressed via cleft clauses which, in their turn, involve
marking part of a clause as a dependent clause. That a dependent clause negator is used
in focused clauses shows that such clauses may be considered underlyingly dependent. That
is, at least predicate focus constructions may be considered clefted, but the evidence only20.4 Further issues in discourse organization543becomes apparent if they are negated. And this should not come as a surpise—it is also the
case in relative and juxtaposed dependent clauses whose status as dependent clauses is fully
revealed under negation. Highlighting focus constructions do not involve relative clauses (see
§19.2): the rearrangement of participants typical for possessor relative clauses does not occur
in highlighting focus constructions.
If a constituent in highlighting focus is contrastive, an option is to employ double focus. This
involves adding another nominal cross-referencing marker, as in 20.89b. Here, the fact that they
do not have a toilet is contrasted to the fact that other, more ‘cultured’ people do:
20.89b [{kwasa
wi
small+fem.sg house
t@-ma:r-dana-l}-a]-al
have-neg.sub-3plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {they do not really have toilet (small house)}’
The existence of double focus structures demonstrates that focus constructions are diﬀerent
from verbless clauses with non-verbal predicate heads: no non-verbal predicate would take
double cross-referencing, outside the focus construction. Unlike 20.60, where a double focus
structure is obligatory, in 20.89b it is pragmatically determined.
Are highlighting focus constructions monoclausal or biclausal? The evidence goes both
ways. A noun phrase in highlighting focus has the appearance of a full verbless clause, since
it includes non-verbal cross-referencing markers. On the other hand, it is not a full clause
because it cannot be negated separately. It occupies the argument slot of the predicate. And
if it is to be questioned, the question word also has to be cast as a focused constituent.
We conclude that highlighting focus constructions combine features of biclausal and monoclausal constructions, and, just like transitivity-neutralizing constructions involving clause
chaining (§17.5), are an additional instance of grammar-in-the-making. A similar construction
in Iatmul was described by Jendraschek (2006b): their status as bi- or monoclausal is equally
ambiguous.20.4 f u rt h e r i s s u e s i n d i s c o u r s e o rga n i zat i o n
Manambu clauses form sentences which contain one main clause, and sentences combine to
form a paragraph. A paragraph—or a coherent stretch of discourse—is deﬁned as having a
topic of its own, and is normally separated from the next paragraph by a signiﬁcant pause.
As we saw above, a topic usually appears preposed to the predicate. A reactivated topic—
that is, a topic mentioned in a previous stretch of discourse and known to the speaker
and to the addressee, but not mentioned for some time—is marked with reactivated topic
demonstratives (see §10.2.3 and §3.3). This is a powerful device which allows speakers to
handle more than one topic at a time. The ways sentences can be linked together within a
paragraph, or across paragraphs, are addressed in §20.4.1. In §20.4.2 we discuss the function
of ‘boundary-marking’ clauses consisting of ya:kya ‘all right’ and its Tok Pisin equivalent orait
(§20.4.2).
We saw in §20.2 above that constituent order plays its role in identiﬁcation of topical participants. Narratives tend to be elaborate in stating participants, while conversational discourse
is highly elliptical, and heavily relies on context. Some of the recurrent principles of ellipsis in
the Manambu discourse are discussed in §20.4.3.","[568, 569, 570]"
"A. ‘Seeing’
The verb v@- means ‘see’, ‘look’, and also ‘try (often by taste or touch)’ and ‘experience’. This
verb has a somewhat unusual argument structure. We can recall, from §7.3, that in its meaning
‘see, look’, it is transitive, and its O is unmarked for case if indeﬁnite or not ‘seen’ completely. If
the object is fully seen and the action is volitional and/or telic (meaning ‘look (at)’, or ‘see well’),
the object is marked with accusative-locative, as in 7.21. But in the meanings ‘look around for’
and ‘see, notice’, the object is marked with dative, as in 7.22 and 7.28.
The O in the meaning of non-volitional and uncontrolled experience is unmarked, as in 7.16
and 21.7. This was an answer to 7.23, a question about the age of Duamakwa:y, the oldest man
in the Manambu communities, at the time when he had met Dangwan (one of the Manambu
interpreters for Behrmann’s 1912–13 expedition to the Ambunti area).

The same meaning of v@- occurs in T2.56 (‘experience body/skin’ means ‘have sex’).
The expression yig@n v@- refers to dreaming—it can be understood either as ‘seeing a dream’
or ‘experiencing a dream’. The polysemy of v@- as ‘see, look’ and ‘experience’ is what makes
Text 1 hilarious for Manambu speakers: it is centred around the expression bap v@- (moon
see/look/experience) which is a conventional way of referring to women’s menstruation as
‘experiencing the moon sickness’. A stupid young man—the main character of Text 1—does
not know this, and understands this expression literally, as ‘looking at the moon’, or ‘seeing
the moon’.
3 According to Laycock (1965: 165), only Yelogu has k2 for ‘eat’ and r@ for ‘drink’ (there are no forms for these in
the SIL survey lists, so I was not able to check this).",[582]
"50419 Other Dependent Clauses19.9 de s u b o r d i nat i o n o f d e p e n d e n t c laus e s
What is an essentially dependent clause can come to be used as a main clause through regular
ellipsis of the erstwhile main clause. This phenomenon known as ‘desubordination’ has been
described for numerous languages, including English (see Stirling 1998). Desubordination and
the change of status of clauses can result in the creation of new tense-aspect-mood paradigms
(as in Australian languages: Dixon 2002a: 148–9), or evidentiality (as in Estonian: Aikhenvald
2004a: 281–3).
Just three of the medial dependent clause types in Manambu are used on their own (see
§18.2–4). In each case, this can be considered ellipsis; however, each use has its own semantic
overtones and can be analysed as a new clause type ‘in the making’.
Sequencing medial clauses with the verb marked with -n (§18.2) appear as strong commands,
as shown in 16.96, and 19.109—an annoyed order to a naughty child to be seated:
19.109 jupwi
taka-n
backside put.down-seq
‘Put your backside down!’ (lit. putting your backside down!)
A medial completive same-subject form on its own can also be used as a command, an
even stronger one. The illocutionary force is comparable to German participle commands, e.g.
hingesessen! ‘sitting here!’ An example is at 19.110—the mother was even more annoyed than
when she shouted 19.109:
19.110 t@k@r-@-m
da-ku
chair-lk-loc sit-compl:ss
‘Sit down on the chair immediately!’ (lit. Having sat on the chair!)
These command strategies ﬁll what can be conceived of as a ‘gap’ in the system. We saw
in §14.4.1 that Manambu has three prohibitive forms: a general prohibitive and two strong
prohibitives. But there is only one positive imperative (§13.2). The diﬀerent degrees of strength
of command corresponding to the degree of strength of prohibition are expressed through
command strategies employing desubordinated clauses. Rough correspondences, with numbers
of example sentences, are in Table 19.5.
A medial sequencing clause can be used as a complete sentence if it states the result of an
activity, as in 19.111. A pause of less than a second’s duration signals a sentence boundary.
There is no pause between the two sequential verb forms in the second sentence.

‘After he too had drunk water, then they two went. As a result they went and arrived in
the village’ (lit. going going out in the village)
Manambu does not have a morphological resultative derivation—desubordinated medial
sequencing clauses play the part of ‘resultative’ strategies.
Medial completive clauses, typically same-subject ones, can be used on their own, with a
completive meaning. A speaker came into the house and showed us a ﬁsh, commenting on
how she had obtained it:
19.112 [sa:n yapi-ku]
money buy/pay-compl.ss
‘I have paid money (for it)’ (lit. having paid money (for it)
This completive use is semantically close to the meaning of the anterior complex predicate
with the auxiliary t@- discussed at §17.1.1. Yet, it is diﬀerent inasmuch as the focus is on the
completion of the action and the result achieved.
Desubordination has its roots in ellipsis. Yet the two are diﬀerent. Consider 19.113b, an
answer to the question in 19.113a:
19.113a ak@
s@k@r væra-k-ñ@na
what.fem.sg time come.back-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgsubj.vt
‘What time will you come back?’
19.113b [na:gw yapi-ku]
sago buy-compl.ss
‘After I had bought sago’ (lit. having bought sago)
This has a clear overtone of sequencing and of relative tense: ‘I will come back after I’ve
bought sago’. Not so with 19.112 which simply focuses on the completion of an action. (An
additional way of focusing on the completion of one action before the start of another is
through using ya:kya ‘OK’ or its Tok Pisin equivalent orait in lieu of a main clause. We return
to this in §20.4.2.)
Along similar lines, a cotemporaneous clause can be used on its own, to express prolonged
action that started before the moment of speech and goes on and on. An example is at
19.114—a mother was exhausted by her baby daughter’s drinking and peeing non-stop. Similar
examples are at 4.33 and 18.35.
19.114 [gu
k@-ta:y]
[wus yi-ta:y]
water consume-cotemp pee go-cotemp
‘All she does is drink and pee’ (lit. having drunk water having peed)
Desubordinated cotemporaneous clauses typically occur in pairs, as in 19.114, 4.33, and
18.35, referring to continuous alternate or simultaneous actions. Since Manambu does not
have a dedicated verbal form to cover this meaning, once again a desubordinated verb can be
said to ﬁll in a gap.
Desubordination of the three dependent clause types discussed here goes hand in hand with
grammaticalizing the most frequent desubordinated forms into connectives. We saw in §18.3
that the form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a conjunction ‘thus, and so’ (18.28).","[530, 531, 532]"

III. Reason, cause, and purpose are expressed as direct speech reports. Example 19.71 did not
involve any speech acts. This was an answer to a child’s question about why her mother had
gone out:

‘She has gone out because of (desire to) pee’ (lit. ‘saying “because of pee” she went out’)
And 16.81 explains the intentions of 9-month-old baby who could not yet talk.
We saw, at §16.2.2, that speech reports are one of the biclausal causative strategies; examples
are at 16.84, 13.24–5, and T2.34.
IV. Apprehensives can be expressed as direct speech reports. In 19.72 a speech report with an
apprehensive meaning contains an irrealis form meaning ‘might’ (see §13.3):
19.72 [aw yaga-di]

du-aba:b aw [a-di

hit-irr-3plsubj.vt-1plbas.vt say-compl:ss
‘So they were afraid, men too, lest the dogs might hit them (lit. having said “Those dogs
might hit us” )’
V. The end result of counting is usually expressed as direct speech report, as in 19.73 and
T2.21. Neither of these contains an actual speech report: the child we were talking about in
19.73 did not speak Manambu and was too shy to speak in the presence of a white woman
anyway.
19.73 nabi a:li wa:d
year four say+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
‘He is 4’ (lit. ‘he says four’)
We have seen that speech reports do not have to imply a speech act. However, there are two
major diﬀerences between speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act and those
reports that do.
First, a direct speech report can precede or follow the reporting verb (as we saw in §19.5.1
above) only if the actual speaking took place. If a speech report is used to express any of
the meanings detailed in I–V in this section, it always has to precede the verb ‘say’. Reported
commands as indirect speech reports also have to precede the verb of speech.
Secondly, speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act tend not to be introduced
by a speech introducer ata ‘then’ (see Aikhenvald 2008).
An additional way of making clear that a speech act has actually taken place is by using a
‘framing’ construction illustrated in 19.51. Then, if a speech report follows the framing clause,
another framing clause is often added at the end of the speech report of the kind ‘they said
[Speech Report] having said’. A typical example is at 19.74:19.6 Clause linking involving connectives49319.74 [wa:l ja-k-na-d]

then say+3masc.sgbas.p no
rain neg say-compl:ss
‘ “It will rain”, I said saying, then he said, “No, it won’t rain”, having said’
A speech report which does not imply a speech act cannot be used in such a ‘framing’
construction. Neither can the verb wa- in any of its ditransitive or transitive usages without
a direct speech report; nor if it is used in one of the lexicalized collocations, such as ma: wa‘refuse, reject’ or ya:kya wa- ‘agree’.
Framing constructions are very frequent. They also appear in speech reports in the local
Tok Pisin: one frequently hears a dialogue being reported using a quote frame na em i tok
olsem na em i tok (and he said thus and he said). This apparent redundancy serves a purpose:
it distinguishes speech acts as speech acts from their metaphorical extensions.19.6 c lause linking involving connectives
Connectives involved in linking clauses occupy clause-initial position. Connectives do not
occur in any of the medial clauses discussed in Chapter 18, or dependent clauses in this chapter.
The connective a-l@-k ‘because; this is why’ is an exception: it can occur in a causal clause (as in
19.75). This connective derives from that-fem.sg-DAT ‘for that’ and is employed only if explicit
statement of reason is appropriate:
19.75 [l@ wuk@mar-la]
[al@k
ma:
she forget-3fem.sgsubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p this.is.why again
wa-tua,

ma:j]
say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt dem.dist+fem.sg story
‘She forgot (it), this is why I am telling it again, the story’
A similar example is at 4.16. Alternatively, the connective al@k can be used within a causal
clause, as in 19.76. This is an explanation as to why there is no men’s road and women’s road
in Malu village.
19.76 [al@k m@ya numa-di k@p

‘So since they do not occupy really big territory, since what is called men’s and women’s
road is small, it is diﬃcult (to have them)’
In T1.16 al@k occurs after the subject wun ‘I’, since the subject is fronted as part of a topicalization strategy (see §20.2). This connective can link sentences as well as clauses as in 18.25,
and T1.22. It often occurs in a main clause preceded by a medial causal clause, as in 18.49 and
19.77, or by another medial clause, as in 18.52.

‘Since it (plane) went down, [this is why] we left our houses’49419 Other Dependent ClausesWe recall, from §18.7, that the connective al@k and the causal medial clause marker -l@k share
their etymology: both come from a dative-marked feminine form of the functionally unmarked
distal demonstrative a-.
We saw in §18.3 that the medial clause form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a
conjunction ‘thus, and so’ when it follows another medial clause (see 18.28). This form is indeed
in the process of grammaticalization as part of a conjunction: al@k t@-ku (dem.dist.fem.sg+dat
stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so, as a result’. It is pronounced as one
phonological word. This connective does not occur with causal clauses. An example is in 19.78:
19.78 [sana:k

[al@k
this.is.why be-compl.ss neg have.neg
‘They (the neighbouring group) gave away the things from men’s house for money, this
is why they do not have (them anymore)’
The connective aw ‘and then; so; but’ links clauses and sentences. Its meaning may involve
contrast, as in 19.79:
wun ñan ma: t@],
[a-d@-r@b
19.79 [vyak@ta-d],

look.after-1duimpv
‘He (the foundling) is nice, and (surprise, surprise: unlike any normal woman) I don’t
have a child, (so) let’s look right after this one’
It occurs as a sentence linker in T2.5–6, and T2.8–9. Also see 19.72 for its sequential
meaning. When repeated, it refers to alternating actions, as in aw yi-n aw ya-n (and.then
go-seq and.then come-seq) ‘on the one hand coming, on the other hand going’ (T3.18). A
similar example, aw war-@n aw da-n (then go.up-seq then go.down-seq) ‘alternately going up
and coming down’ is in T2.8. This same form can link noun phrases, e.g. aw kami: aw lau-lap
(then ﬁsh then ripe-banana) ‘(we eat) sometimes ﬁsh sometimes banana’ (or both).
The connective a ‘then, as a result’ has a sequential meaning, as in T2.3 and 19.4. It can link
dependent clauses, as in T3.18 where it is similar to aw. It may have an adversative meaning,
roughly translatable as ‘but’, as in 10.22b. The form a probably comes from the feminine distal
demonstrative ‘that’.
Connectives which link sentences within a paragraph are ata ‘then’, and atawata:y (from ata
wa-ta:y ‘then say-cotemp’) ‘and so then, in summary, this is why’. The latter is a result of a
recent grammaticalization of ata and a medial clause form of ‘say’. The semantic development
is congruent with the use of wa- ‘say’ to express reason (see §19.5.6). The connective atawata:y is
often used without reference to an actual speech act, as in 18.33 where the speaker talks about
how the Avatip people lived during the Second World War when they had to hide from the
Japanese invaders. Or it may refer cataphorically or anaphorically to an actual speech report,
as in 19.80:

‘Thus/this way they lied to him about women (lit. put woman-lie to him), “You will
marry a woman, we will give you a young woman”, thus they said to him’
The connective ata often introduces speech reports which imply actual speech, as can be
seen throughout the texts at the end of this grammar. It typically precedes the verb and never
occurs on the ﬁrst sentence in a text (see examples 4.12 and T1.1, T1.8, T1.10, and T1.12). In
the third clause of T1.12 the connective ata is placed after the imperative verb ‘go’; this adds
to the urgency of the command.
Ata can intervene between parts of numerous multiword constituents involving verbs (for
instance, complex predicates: see §17.1–5, and negative constructions: see Chapter 14).
The question of whether the form ata meaning ‘how; thus’ and ata as a negator of desiderative and same-subject purposive (see §14.3.2) are related to each other and to the connective
ata remains open. Several instances of ata in its diﬀerent meanings do not occur; we can recall,
from §10.4, that a repeated form ata ata has just the interrogative meaning ‘how?’
When used in the predicate slot or as part of predicate focus, ata ‘connective’ and ata ‘thus,
how’ take the predicate marker -n (see §10.2.3 on its occurrence with reactivated topic-marking
demonstratives), as in 4.79 and 10.103. No other connective can be focused or head a predicate.
The connective k@pa:b ‘in case’ introduces dependent conditional clauses discussed at §13.7
and §18.8 (examples 13.88, and 18.52). This connective is most probably a terminative case form
of k@ p ‘just’ (§21.2.2). Just like any other connective, k@pa:b occupies a clause-initial position.19.7 j u xta p o s i t i o n o f m a i n c laus e s
Several main clauses can be juxtaposed to one another. Such juxtaposed main clauses do
not have a special rising intonation contour characteristic of dependent juxtaposed clauses
discussed at §19.1. There is usually a short pause between the clauses. Juxtaposition of clauses
has the following semantic eﬀects.
I. A subsequent clause oﬀers a comment or a clariﬁcation to the preceding clause, elaborating
on it. Examples include 19.79, and also 19.9, 19.29, 14.11, 14.12, 14.53, 14.95, 14.97, 14.104, and
T1.9, T1.19–20, T1.22, and T1.28. A similar example is at 19.81: Kuk@lyabau was explaining
that she was a little girl when the Second World War broke out. The fourth clause provides
additional information to the third clause.

rhetorical device, to make sure the hearer understands the point made. Similar examples come
from beginnings and endings of stories—this can be seen in T1.35, T2.68, and T3.1.
II. A subsequent clause oﬀers an alternative, or a correction, to the preceding clause, as in
14.102 and 14.105. If the subsequent clause is cast in irrealis (see §13.3), it acquires an apprehensive meaning—that is, is understood as a warning against something negative. Examples
are at 13.43 and 19.82.

sit-irr-irr+3fem.sgsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Turn that plate upside down, or else a ﬂy would sit (on it)’
A juxtaposed irrealis clause can be negated with the dependent negator -ma:r-, as shown
in 19.83 (the meaning is that of possible negative consequence). This is unlike irrealis in main
clauses which is negated with the particle ak@s (see §14.3.1); also see 13.35. This suggests that
juxtaposed irrealis clauses could well be treated as a subtype of dependent clauses.

‘Wash these plates, (or else) you will not eat the food’
III. If one of the clauses is negated, the relationship between juxtaposed clauses is that of
contrast, as in 14.41, 14.135, and 14.156. Juxtaposition of a positive and a negative clause can
be used as a means of clausal disjunction, as in 7.23.
IV. The subsequent clause marks consequence or reason if it contains an imperative or a
desiderative, as in 13.12, 13.20, 13.23–4, 13.58, 14.31, 14.90, 14.108, and 19.48. Both clauses
can contain either an imperative or a desiderative, as in 19.84.
19.84 [væk akrawul]
[s@kul@k yi-k@r]
pot impv+bring+inside cooking do-des
‘Bring the pot inside (the house), (because) I want to cook’
V. A clause juxtaposed to another clause has a simultaneous temporal meaning if the verb
cross-references time in the second position. This is the case in 19.81 (second clause: ‘(time
when) the war came’) and 9.33. This illustrates the anaphoric or cataphoric function of crossreferencing time in the second position on the verb, which acts as an additional clause-linking
device.
VI. Juxtaposition of clauses may also reﬂect a sequence of actions, as in T1.27. Juxtaposition
of two clauses with positional verbs has a similar eﬀect, e.g. 19.85:
19.85 [wun-a-d@

sit+3masc.sgbas.p
‘My ancestor kept going up the sago (ﬁelds) (and) settled down (lit. sat) (there)’19.8 Complementation strategies497We will see in §20.1.4 that there are no pivot restrictions on coreferential deletion of arguments
in clause juxtaposition, with just one exception: if juxtaposition of clauses reﬂects a sequence
of actions the subjects are always shared.19.8 c o m p l e m e n tat i o n s t rat e g i e s
Manambu has no complement clauses as a separate clause type. Existing clause types are
used in lieu of complement clauses depending on verb type, the semantics of complement
clause (whether fact or activity, or potential), and the relative tense of the complement clause
(see Dixon 2006, for the basic principles for a typological approach to complementation). A
clausal complement can be in S or O function (but never in A function). These correlations are
summarized in Table 19.4.
We discuss the existing complementation strategies one by one.
I. Completive medial clauses (discussed at §18.3) are used as clausal complements exclusively
in O function, with the verbs of perception such as ‘see/look’ and ‘hear/listen/obey’ (and
compounds and directional forms involving these: see Chapters 15 and 16). They indicate that
the action of the clausal complement precedes that of the main clause. The semantics of clausal
complement is activity or fact. If the subject of the main clause and of the clausal complement
are diﬀerent, diﬀerent subject forms are employed. Examples are at 19.86–7; also see T2.4,
T3.20, and T3.48.
19.86 [amæy wa-l@-k]

‘After he’d seen that she’d done this because of the eel (her husband killed this eel)’
II. Juxtaposition of main clauses (also see §19.7) is used for a clausal complement in O function with the same verbs of perception. Juxtaposition is used if the action of the complement
is either simultaneous or subsequent to the main clause—in contrast to the completive medial
clauses in I above. Examples of simultaneous action are at 19.48, 19.88–9, 19.93a–b, 19.94, and
also T1.11 and T3.16.

If the action of the clausal complement is subsequent to that of the main clause, it can be
cast in future tense, as in 19.90. Such constructions are polysemous, in that they can denoteTable 19.4 Complementation strategies in Manambu

this is morphological—we can recall, from §13.3, that future morphology is homophonous
with irrealis.

appear-fut/irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt see-fut/irr-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
(a) ‘I will see her appear’ (lit, she will appear I will see)
(b) ‘I will see if she appears’
The sentence in 19.90 could also be understood as consisting of a juxtaposed dependent
clause and a main clause (see §19.1), if it had a characteristic intonation contour with sharp
rise on the last word of the juxtaposed clause. Then the reading would have been ‘If she had
appeared I would have seen her/it’. This highlights the importance of intonation.
A juxtaposed main clause can be used in lieu of a clausal complement of verbs ma: wa(no say) ‘refuse’ and ya:kya wa- (OK say) ‘agree’, when they refer to a fact or activity and
involve diﬀerent subjects. We will see, at IV below, that if their subjects are the same, the
same-subject purposive or dative-aversive-marked nominalization will be preferred. Potential meaning entails the use of either diﬀerent-subject purposive or a dative-aversive-marked
nominalization. In 19.91, a fact complement expressed with a juxtaposed clause (clause 1) is
contrasted to a potential complement expressed with a dative-aversive-marked nominalization.

Juxtaposition is also used if the clausal complement is in S function of the verb kus@- ‘ﬁnish’.
The clause which corresponds to the complement often cross-references time or manner in
second position. The main clause takes feminine singular cross-referencing as a default option
(see §5.2.3).

Juxtaposition of a main clause can also be used in lieu of a clausal argument in the O slot of
mental processes: knowing, as in 19.93a–b, and forgetting, as in 19.94. The juxtaposed clause
as a complementation strategy can be preposed or postposed to the clause containing the verb
of mental process:

‘Then I forgot that I put (the hair cream on top of the mosquito net)’ (lit. I forgot it-wasthe case that I put (it there) )
Finally, one main clause juxtaposed to another may be used in lieu of a clausal argument
marking an activity in the S function in a verbless clause, as in 19.95.
19.95 [vyak@t-a]
[væra-m@na]
good-3fem.sgnom come.toward-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘It is good you came/are coming’ (lit. it is good—you came/are coming)
In each case, the clause boundary is signalled by an intonation break (less than a second
duration).
III. A relative clause with or without an overtly stated head noun can be used to express
clausal complement referring to a fact, as in 19.96a–b. The way of saying ‘tell me why you
came’ is ‘tell me the reason for which you came’.
19.96a [ya-m@na

[wa-m@na]
[wuk@u]
say-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt listen+1sgimpv
‘You tell why you came, so that I listen’
Another way of saying essentially the same thing is 19.96b. The diﬀerence is that in 19.96a
the speaker is requesting the full story concerning the reason of the other person’s coming,
while 19.96b presupposes a simpler statement—a ‘thing’ fought about:
19.96b [warya-bra
ja:p] [ma: la:kw]
ﬁght+come-3dusubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p thing neg know:neg
‘I do not know why (lit. thing) they fought about’
Headless relative clauses, like the one at 19.25 (and 19.23a), can also be interpreted as
complementation strategies. They can express fact or activity. The syntactic context in 19.25
makes it clear that we are dealing with a headless relative clause: the common argument has
been omitted, but the adjective referring to it remains in its position in the noun phrase.
However, we saw above that a headless relative clause can be almost indistinguishable from
a main clause (cf. 19.26). And clause juxtaposition as a complementation strategy may also
be homonymous with a headless relative clause. So, 19.97a is inherently ambiguous between
reading (a), with a juxtaposed clause as a complementation strategy, and reading (b) as a
headless relative clause.

dependent clause negator -ma:r-, and the juxtaposed clause would be negated like any main
clause (§14.5). The negated relative clause is at 19.97b, and a juxtaposed main clause at 19.97c:

A similar example, with a verb of knowledge and understanding, is at 19.98, an angry shout at
a naughty and disobedient child:
19.98 [laku-ñ@na]
[wa-tua]
know/understand-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt say-1fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
(a) ‘Did you understand that I was telling you (what to do)?’
(b) ‘Did you understand what I was telling you?’
IV. Same-subject purposive marks a purpose complement of any verb if semantically appropriate, as shown in 7.76 and 19.43 (see §19.4.1). Same-subject purposive can also be used as a
complementation strategy with the verb ‘say’ if the subject of the verb expressing purpose or
intention is coreferential with the subject of ‘say’—see 13.45, 19.57 (§19.5.4), and 19.99:
19.99 [kwasa

wa-m@n@-l]
say-2masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
‘When I was a small girl you spoke of marrying me’
V. Different-subject purposive clauses can mark a purpose complement of any verb (see
§19.4.1 and §13.4.2, and 13.54–5). This is also used in indirect commands, as in 19.54 and
13.49. A purposive clause as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ is the only way of forming a
diﬀerent-subject complement clause for the concept of ‘wanting’: 19.100 is ambiguous between
‘we told them to go to the house’ and ‘we wanted them to go to the house’. This ambiguity can
only be resolved by context.
19.100 [wiya:r

(b) ‘We wanted them two to go to the house’
In 13.51, only the ‘wanting’ reading is appropriate, since there was no speech act involved.
In diﬀerent subject ‘wanting’ constructions, the verb ‘say’ can be omitted, as in 19.101. Then,
there is no ambiguity between ‘telling someone to do something’ and ‘wanting someone to do
something’. Similar examples are at 13.55, and 14.70.

This use of the diﬀerentsubject purposive may be interpreted as an instance of desubordination—whereby the erstwhile
dependent clause becomes a main clause. Diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses are also used as
complementation strategies with verbs of asking, as in 13.52. An alternative is a direct speech
report, or a reported question, in VI below.
VI. Desiderative clause can mark a purposive complement of any verb—see §19.4.2 and §13.5
and 19.47. Desideratives in dependent clauses in O function can be used as complementation
strategies with potential meaning involving verbs of negative desire, such as ‘be unwilling’ in
19.102:

I
chicken egg eat-des unwilling go-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
‘I am unwilling to eat chicken egg’
A desiderative clause in the direct speech report slot of the verb wa- is the only way of
reporting non-ﬁrst person’s desire—see 19.58 and 13.57. A desiderative clause can be in the
S slot of a verbless clause—see 13.65.
VII. Direct speech reports framed by the verb wa- ‘say’ can be used as complementation
strategies. We saw in §19.5 above that a direct speech report is a special grammatical relation.
The meanings of direct speech reports range from fact/activity to potential, and can involve
statements, questions, and commands.
VIII. Reported questions can be used as complementation strategies in the O slot of the verb
of knowledge/understanding:
19.103 [wun-aba:b ma: la:kw]
[agwa-mi d@-k@-di t@k@-mi-a-di]
I-too

‘I, too, do not know what tree they are seeds of’

[kas
du-ta:kw
t@-na-di]
I
neg know:neg how.many man-woman be/have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘I do not know how many people they have (in Malu)’
In 19.104, the interrogative quantiﬁer kas is postposed to the noun ‘people’ which is its normal
position (see 10.109–10 in §10.4). Reported questions typically refer to fact or activity. They
are rather rare in discourse of any sort, and may have been calqued from Tok Pisin or even
English.
IX. Nominalizations are widely used as complementation strategies. We can recall, from
§9.1.1, that deverbal nominalizations with Ø-case marking in O function are employed as
complementation strategies, with the verb ‘know’, as in 9.2, and ‘ﬁnish’, as in 4.8. A deverbal
nominalization in S function can also serve as a complementation strategy, as in 9.3. A
nominalization can be a complement of a verb ‘be diﬃcult’, as in 4.7, 9.9, 19.43, and T3.20,
T3.33, and T3.35. An action nominalization can occur in the predicate slot, as in T3.34 (where
it is negated). These nominalizations always refer to activity or fact.
Deverbal nominalizations marked with dative-aversive case -Vk are used in the O slot of
verbs to do with not wanting, refusing, forbidding, feeling shame, as in 9.5–6, 13.78, and 13.81,
waiting as in 9.4, forgetting as in 13.79, being afraid of doing something, as in 13.82, and in the
sense of ‘for fear of’, as in 9.7 and 13.83, or ordering not to do something, as in 15.111.","[518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529]"

Unlike any other command, negative or positive, a third person negative imperative can
occur marked as highlighting focus. A girl strongly prohibits her paternal uncle and his children
from coming into the house, since they had mistreated herself and her brother when they were
little. Her statement contrasts with what her brother has to say.

‘He is not going to go up to this house of mine, it is the case that not even one man is
to come up (into the house). It is the case that he must not go to this side of the house
close to you’ (said the girl to her brother)
An alternative form of the -ba- third person negative imperative contains an additional syllable -k@- between the person-gender-number marker and the suﬃx -ba-. An example is in 14.105:
the bush baby (referred to in 14.94) is not to take oﬀ his grass skirt, under any circumstances.
The negative imperative is in highlighting focus: what he is not to do is contrasted to what
other boys do—that is, wash naked.

‘It is the case that he is not to wash having untied the grass skirt, he should wash with
grass skirt (on)’
The two alternatives, with and without -k@-, appear to be identical in meaning and use. The
absence of -k@- in forms quoted in 14.102–4 can be explained as a result of intervocalic -klenition (see A3 in §2.6). The only problem with this explanation is that in all clear cases of
intervocalic -k- lenition, k is invariably supplied in careful speech register. In contrast, the two
alternative forms of the third person negative imperative occur in all speech registers. The third
person negative imperative is rare in discourse. Young and innovative speakers know the forms,
but hardly ever use them.
What they use instead is an innovative third person imperative construction consisting of the
verb stem followed by the dependent clause negator -ma:r- and then by third person imperative
markers (listed in Table 13.1). Such commands do not have a strong overtone of negative
obligation—their meaning is that of a negative command to third person. A mother told her
eldest daughter not to let a younger daughter wear dirty trousers to church:32414 Negation14.106 kusu-ma:r-kwa
wear-neg.sub-impv.3p+fem.sg
‘May she not wear (this)’
A wish that an unwanted guest should not come was spontaneously phrased as:
14.107 ya-ma:r-kwa-d
come-neg.sub-impv.3p-masc.sg
‘May he not come!’
Such forms can also be used to express indirect causation, as in 14.108. This was said as an
explanation of why I had to use a hairclip:
14.108 l@-k@
nab kay-gwaj-@n
t@-na-d
she-obl+fem.sg hair manip-wrap-seq stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
væker-ma:r-kwa-d
fall-neg.sub-impv.3p-masc.sg
‘It (hairclip) wraps her hair, so that (the hair) should not fall down’
These forms are used in everyday speech by speakers of all ages—but they are condemned
by some speakers, especially those puristically oriented, as ‘non-existent’ and ‘wrong’. Given
that older and traditional speakers consider them wrong, I hypothesize that they constitute a
recent innovation. We will see, in §14.5.3 below, that the subordinate negator -ma:r- can be used
in main declarative clauses if they refer to a wish, or if the clause is in focus. The meaning of
‘wish’ is consistent with the third person command; and it is likely that third person imperative
markers were added to the -ma:r- form by analogy.
One cannot exclude, however, that this seemingly innovative negative imperative is in fact an
archaic form. We will also see, at the end of §14.5, that the negator -mar-ék marks negative
commands in Wosera (Wilson 1980: 164–5). If the markers in Manambu and Wosera are
related, the negative imperative use of Manambu -ma:r- may be a retention rather than an
innovation.14.5 ne gat i o n o f d e p e n d e n t c laus e s, q u e s t i o n s,
a n d f o c u s s t ru c t u r e s
Dependent clauses are negated with the negator -ma:r- which follows the verb stem. If the
verb stem undergoes vowel changes in a non-future negative form (as outlined in §11.3.2), the
non-future negative form is preferred, e.g. kur- ‘do/get’, negative ma: kwa:r ‘do(es) not/did not
do/get’, dependent negative kwa:r-ma:r-, k@l- ‘dry (of water)’, ma: ka:l ‘do(es) not/did not dry’,
negative dependent ka:l-ma:r- (also see the ﬁrst line of 14.55, with the form kwa:y- ‘negative
non-future give.to.third.person’). There is a tendency to reduce either the root vowel, or the
aﬃx vowel, so as to avoid having two long vowels in one phonological word (in agreement
with §2.5.1). That is, variants kwar-ma:r- (rather than kwa:r-ma:r-) and ka:l-mar- (rather than
ka:l-ma:r) are not uncommon.
However, many speakers use a non-negative form, as is the case in a headless relative clause
in 14.122. Those who prefer the negative form are typically innovative ‘big men’; while women,
who are more traditional speakers, tend to use the non-negative form.
The negative dependent marker -ma:r- is used in three basic contexts: to negate the predicate
of a variety of types of dependent clause (§14.5.1), to negate the predicate of questions (§14.5.2),14.5 Negation of dependent clauses325and in independent clauses, among them the ones expressing wishes and laments (§14.5.3). That
the three clause types are negated in the same way indicates similarities in their underlying
structure.
The marker -ma:r- is compatible with the future and the non-past habitual -kwa- (see 14.58,
14.118, and 14.124) in juxtaposed clauses, causal clauses, and relative clauses. (The actionfocus -na-, the future, or the optative modality are not used in any of these.) In all other
clauses, -ma:r- occurs with whatever clause-chaining aﬃxes are appropriate. The negative
clauses preserve the same speciﬁcations as the corresponding non-negative clauses. That is,
diﬀerent-subject clauses keep their subject cross-referencing in positive and in negative forms
(see 14.19, 14.112, and 14.113), and same-subject clauses have none in either (as in 14.111).
A non-negative uninﬂected predicate remains uninﬂected if negated, as does the manner
sequential form (14.109), the cotemporaneous form (14.114), and the immediate sequencing
form (14.115).","[349, 350, 351, 352]"
"19.5.2 Direct speech reports
An overwhelming majority of speech reports in Manambu are direct speech reports. These
tend to reproduce what has been said without any shift in personal, temporal, or spatial deixis.
Direct speech reports are often quotations. And more often than not they convey not just the
words, but the intonation, the look, the gestures, the particular tone of voice, and so on. As
Clark and Gerrig (1990: 772) put it, ‘the internal structure of quotation is really the structure
of what is being depicted, and that can range from the raging of a person to the racket of a
machine’. Examples of direct speech reports with interjections and vocatives are at T1.3, and
T3.40–2 and T3.50.
Reported questions are cast as direct speech reports: see 19.52 and T2.26:
19.52 [ [ñ@ kas]
wa-ku]
[bas sa:d]
sun how.much say-compl:ss ﬁrst plant+3masc.sgbas.p
‘He asked (saying) what time it is’
What looks like a reported question can be used as a complementation strategy, as in
19.103–4. A constituent within a speech report can be questioned, as in 10.113.
Narratives frequently consist of dialogues. The change of speaker is signalled by an intonation break, and a change in a tone of voice; then the actual verb of speech may be mentioned
once at the beginning of a dialogue and subsequently omitted. This is the case in T1.6–7,
T.1.11–12 and T1.23–4.
The verb wa- is the only speech verb which consistently introduces speech reports. A few
other verbs denoting speech acts (most of which are intransitive: see §19.5.5), such as gra‘cry’, ga:m s@- ‘call; serenade’, wa-taka- (say-put) ‘order’, wa-jali- (say-?) ‘call’, can occur in a
dependent medial clause preceding a clause with wa- ‘say’ and then following a direct speech
report, as in 19.49. If the verb of speech is recoverable from the context, it can be omitted.",[512]
"17.2 Complex predicates containing support verbs43517.2.4 How to choose a support verb for a nominal
The semantic principles behind the assignment of a support verb to particular nominals are not
always straightforward. While ideophones, expressives, and descriptions of natural phenomena
almost exclusively warrant na-, for many nominals referring to physical states the choice
appears to be arbitrary, and the support verb has to be remembered. The nominal wiyaw
‘light and dry’ requires the support verb na-; and the nominal væt ‘heavy’ goes with yi-. The
nominal k@rk@m ‘silent’ requires na-, and its near synonym m@k@m@k requires t@-, as shown
in 17.40.
Alternatively, m@k@m@k (but not k@rk@m) can occur in an aspectual complex verb containing either r@- or kwa- —see 17.39 and 14.117. Both 17.39 and 17.40 have distinct positional
overtones.

Two support verbs can sometimes be interchangeable: karkwas yi- and karkwas kur- ‘squabble’ are a case in point. Not so for the nominal kaig@n ‘quiet’ which requires the support verb
t@-, r@-, or kwa- depending on the subject’s position and the aspectual value of the clause, as in
17.41a–c.

kwa-na
17.41c kaig@n aka

‘She is staying quiet’ (long time)
If used in the same clause as yi-, kaig@n can only be interpreted as a modiﬁer to yi- in its
meaning ‘go’ as a main verb—see 17.42.

The nominal component of a complex predicate can be questioned, with at@ta ‘how?’ (see
§10.4), as illustrated in 17.43a–b.
kag@l yi-na
17.43a ab-a
head-3fem.sgnom pain ‘go’:sup.vb-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt

at@ta yi-na?
head-3fem.sgnom how ‘go’:sup.vb-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Head is what?’ (lit. Head is how?), i.e. ‘What’s the matter with your head?’
This is unlike complex predicates of other kinds, where the non-auxiliary component cannot
be questioned. We can recall, from §4.2.2, that copula clauses are structurally similar to
support verb constructions; moreover, the copula complement shares features with the nominal
component of support verb constructions. The ability of being questioned is one such feature.
An additional complication comes into play. Polyfunctional verbs which form aspectual
and modal complex verbs and occur as support verbs also appear in what can be considered
lexicalized complex predicates. This is the topic of our next section.17.3 l e x i c a l i z e d c o m p l e x p r e d i c at e s
As we saw in the previous section, the choice of a support verb can be fairly unpredictable.
Many support verb constructions are lexicalized. Nominal components of lexicalized complex
predicates vary in their status: some are full nouns, and others have few nominal properties.
For instance, s@kul@k as in s@kul@k yi- (cook go/do) ‘do cooking, cook’ cannot head an NP in
any function other than purpose. Then it is marked with dative case, as in 17.44:
s@kul@k-a:k
17.44 ñ@n
adakw
al@dab
you.fem stay:impv dem.dist+fem.sg+down+term cooking-lk+dat
‘You (feminine) stay right down there, for (the purpose of doing) the cooking’
Whether a nominal component in complex verbs is part of the verb’s argument structure
or not is a diﬃcult question. The meaning of complex verbs is idiomatic to a varying extent.
For instance, the verbs ji- and sakwi- are used only in complex verbs with s@p ‘skin’, meaning
‘be fed up’. The nominal component m@yakw is not used anywhere except with the verb kwa‘stay’; the resulting complex verb meyakw kwa- means ‘like’.
Other complex verbs are semantically transparent. The noun gu ‘water’ in gu yaku- (water
wash) ‘bathe’ can be interpreted as the unmarked typical location for ‘washing oneself’; sua:l
‘lie, story’ can be interpreted as the object of taka- ‘put’, and kur- ‘do’, in expressions sua:l takaand sua:l kur- ‘to lie’. The verbs yaku- ‘wash’, taka- ‘put’, and kur- ‘do’ are transitive if used on
their own. Complex verbs ‘bathe’ and ‘lie’ are intransitive. That is, a nominal component of a
complex verb may aﬀect the transitivity of the whole.
Numerous complex predicates consist of a nominal which usually cannot head a predicate
on its own, followed by a verb from a closed class. They share the following features:
(i) they form two independent phonological and grammatical words;
(ii) their components tend to be contiguous, and only constituents such as ata ‘then’,
reactivated topic demonstratives, and adverbs can intervene between them;
(iii) the order of components can be reversed as a means of marking afterthought;
(iv) the nominal component cannot be questioned;
(v) the nominal component or the verb can be ellipsed if clear from the context;
(vi) it is often the case that the nominal component is not used elsewhere in the language;
and
(vii) they are translated into Tok Pisin or English as one verb, and when code-switching
takes place they are replaced with a one-word verb.","[461, 462, 463]"

Table 17.1 contrasts the major types of complex predicates (CP) in terms of the following
criteria:
1. Types of inflected verb: polyfunctional verbs are used in complex predicates containing
auxiliaries and support verbs, while lexicalized complex predicates and body part constructions can contain other verbs. This agrees with the major property of polyfunctional
verbs: their ability to be used as grammatical markers.

cannot be formed on stative verbs, or involve non-verbal predicate heads. This sets them
apart from other complex predicates.
3. Role of the inflected verb as a grammatical marker for complex verbs with auxiliaries
and complex verbs with support verbs sets these apart from lexicalized CP and body part
constructions which are largely idiomatic collocations.
4. Combination with other CPs reﬂects the restriction on co-occurrence of CPs with same
polyfunctional verbs, and other restrictions.
5. Omission of inflected verb is a property of most CPs with support verbs and lexicalized
CPs.
6. Strict order of components, or lack thereof, is a property of lexicalized CPs.
7. Variation in cross-referencing depending on focus is a unique property of body part
constructions.
8. Questioning a component separately is a unique property of some CPs containing
support verbs.
Table 17.1 shows that we can distinguish at least four types of complex predicates, in terms of
these properties. In addition, complex predicates with support verbs may divide into additional
subclasses, with CPs containing loan verbs set apart from the rest by the restriction on the
omission of the support verb in main clauses. Unlike any other complex predicates, aspectual
complex predicates can contain two lexical verbs.
A certain amount of unpredictability in the choice of support verbs brings them close to
lexicalized idiomatic complex predicates.","[470, 471, 472]"
"21.2.2 How grammar helps disambiguate polysemy
We saw above that Manambu shows an interplay of speciﬁc detail and overwhelming generality
throughout its lexicon. One example is the kinship system (of Omaha type) which is rather
complex. However, some distinctions are not made—at least not overtly. One word, ta:kw,
covers ‘wife’ and ‘woman’. In contrast, there are two distinct words for ‘man’ and ‘husband’.
The terms for husband (la:n) and man (du) are only partly interchangeable: referring to a
husband as du is considered highly informal. When sisters-in-law (one’s brother’s wives or cowives) who are in a joking relationship tease each other (as illustrated in 4.56), one is expected
to say to the other wun ñ@n-a la:n-ad@wun ‘I (masculine) am your husband (feminine)’ (see
5.16). Replacing la:n with du would be inappropriate.But there is no word for ‘wife’ other than
ta:kw ‘woman’.
A distinction between ‘wife’ and ‘woman’ can be made if desired. We can recall, from
Chapter 6, that only kinship terms form plurals, as does the word for husband, lanugw. The
word ta:kw forms a plural only if it has the meaning ‘wife’: takwa:gw can usually only mean
‘wives’, as in 6.1 (just occasionally can it be used jokingly to refer to a group of women, with
an ironic overtone of an ‘old girls’ club’). There is no ∗ duagw because du is not a kinship term.
This is how diﬀerent grammatical possibilities can diﬀerentiate polysemous nouns.
We saw above (§16.1.1) that the expression ta:kw kra- (woman get-) is used to refer to man’s
marriage. Here, ta:kw means ‘wife’. When a woman gets married, this is called du-a:k r@- (manlk+dat sit-), or, occasionally, lan@k r@- (husband+lk+dat sit-), or la:n r@-. And again, here
du means ‘husband’. Using a noun as a verb’s argument restricts its reference and limits its
polysemy—we return to this further below.
The highly polysemous noun kudi is another case in point. It may refer to ‘speech, language,
noise’ and ‘(the outside of) the mouth’. We saw in §6.1 that this second meaning is very
restricted: it appears in compounds, e.g. s@p-a-kudi (skin-lk-mouth) ‘lip’, kudiy-@-gu (mouthlk-water) ‘saliva’, and in ﬁxed expressions, e.g. kudi nak (mouth one) ‘one mouthful, a little
bit’. (A general term for mouth is day.) The plural kudi-ugw only occurs in the ﬁrst sense, with
a collective meaning (‘lips and mouth’) and has an archaic feel to it (see 6.2).
In combination with the verb of speech wa-, kudi may refer to a sound made by a non-human
(or a baby): t@b kudi wa-na-d (sky language/noise say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt) means ‘there is
a noise of thunder’, literally, ‘sky says language/noise’. If modiﬁed by an adjective, kudi often
refers to ‘voice’: 21.30 is an alternative to 5.13:
21.30 numa-d@
kudi
aw
big-masc.sg language/noise impv+speak
‘Speak loudly!’ (lit. speak big-masculine language/noise)21.2 Polysemy, speciﬁcity, and disambiguation567In compounds, kudi refers to diﬀerent languages, or diﬀerent speech genres. So, Manab@
kudi means ‘Manambu language’, Ñaula kudi means ‘Iatmul language’, Kum kudi ‘Kwoma
language’, and wali-kudi (white.man-language) ‘Tok Pisin’ (and, just occasionally, English). A
general term for indigenous language is t@p-a kudi, ‘village language’, as in 21.28 above. The
term gra-kudi (cry-language) is the term used for mourning songs.
In all these instances, the possibility of forming a plural helps disambiguate a polysemous
noun. For the high-frequency adverb k@p this works only partly. The form k@p has the following
meanings:
1. ‘Just, for nothing’, as in 21.31a–b:
21.31a k@p kwa-na-d

3. ‘For no reason’, as in 21.31d.

‘Just move away, to this side (of the canoe)’
5. ‘One’s own’, as in 21.31f (also see 21.16 above and discussion there). An alternative to k@p
m@l would be k@p-a m@l (just-lk eye):
k@p m@l
21.31f ma: v@
neg see+neg just eye
‘She cannot see with her own eyes’ (meaning: she is not paying attention)
6. The general ‘goodwill’ address term of the same form k@p, plural k@pugw ‘my dear’, was
mentioned in §4.1.2. This is used in commands and farewells, often clause-ﬁnally, as in 21.32a
(also see §21.5 below, on greetings and farewells). K@p optionally cliticizes to the verb.
21.32a maya

‘Go, my dear’
The expression yara k@p (ﬁne dear) ‘let everything be ﬁne, my dear’ is used similarly to ‘thank
you’, or just to say ‘everything is OK’. The form k@p implies either a singular, or a generic
referent. If the speaker wants to address explicitly plural referents, k@p as an address term can
be pluralized with the suﬃx -(V)gw (see §6.1), as shown in 21.32b–c. This form tends to be56821 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexiconused to refer to plural addressees as a mark of respect. In 21.32b, Duamakwa:y was addressing

7. The form k@p appears in the conjunction k@pa:b ‘in case’ (see §14.5.1 and §19.5).
The question arises: should these uses of k@p be considered simple homonyms or instances of
one, polysemous form? The address form k@p, plural k@pugw could be considered as separate
from the others on formal grounds. As far as the rest are concerned, the question remains open.
Only in some cases can etymology help distinguish what looks like the same morpheme—we
return to this in §22.1.
A polysemous root may acquire an additional meaning when reduplicated. The non-agreeing
adjective kula means ‘new’, as in kula-ma:j ‘new word, new story’, ‘fresh’, as in kula-kija:p
‘fresh protein food’, and ‘raw’, as in kula-kami: ‘raw, uncooked ﬁsh’. It also appears in combination with gu ‘water’ as kul-gu ‘fresh or cool water, ﬂowing water (in contrast to stagnant
water)’ (the lack of the linker is puzzling; Pauline Laki suggested that this combination could
have been inﬂuenced by Tok Pisin kol wara ‘cold water’). When reduplicated, kula-kul means
‘lacking previous knowledge, ignorant, newcomer’. We will see, in §21.2.3 below, how the root
‘bad, poor’ has just the meaning ‘bad’ when used in an echo compound.","[593, 594, 595]"
"60822 Genetic and Areal Relationships22.4.2 Morphological and syntactic integration of Tok Pisin and English
code-switches and calques
Foreign nouns and other non-verbs often occur in their root form. They can be fully inﬂected.
Nouns ending in a consonant can take the linker a, as does beg ‘bag’ in 22.32c, ailand in T1.10,
kar ‘car’; or @, as does ailan ‘island’ in T1.11; or i , as does bus ‘bush’ in T1.21.
The behaviour of verbs in code-switching deserves special mention. A code-switch consisting
of a verb plus its object cannot be inﬂected, and has to occur with a support verb, as in 21.22.
Loan verbs can be treated as parts of complex predicates with support verbs (see examples
in §17.2.2), e.g. stati t@ - ‘start’, pinisi t@ - ‘ﬁnish’, andestand t@ - ‘understand’. Or they can be
inﬂected, as in 22.3, from a speech by an orator at the name debate (8 October 2004). In the
examples, English forms are underlined and Tok Pisin forms are in italics.

22.3 witness em nau kamapu-n
witness it now come.up-seq correct/settle-fut-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘As the witness/evidence is appearing, we will correct (the information)’
Or this may be uninﬂected, as in 22.4:
22.4 wun askim aka
k@p olsem wun askim
I
ask
dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg only just I
ask
‘I am asking, I am just asking’
The same ‘code-switched’ verb can occur without either inﬂection or support verb, and then
occur inﬂected, within one sentence. Example 22.5, also from the name debate, illustrates this:
22.5 wun aka
stretim streti-ku

‘I am now correcting (the statements by previous orators), after I have corrected (this), it
will be OK’
This is not restricted to a spontaneous oral discourse. Kulanawi, Simon Harrison’s classiﬁcatory father, dictated me a letter which I was to send to Simon Harrison (whose Manambu
name is Yuas@s@g). Simon Harrison lives in Belfast, and Kulanawi was worried that he might
have been aﬀected by what Kulanawi saw as the ongoing warfare in Ireland:

‘Yuas@s@g, you did not reply to the letter I sent, this is why I am worried, as I did not

inﬂected. Wori ‘be worried’ appears with a support verb.
This variability in the treatment of code-switches and borrowings is indicative of their uncertain status as marginal—albeit dangerously frequent—insertions into ‘proper’ Manambu.
We will now turn to the issue of the linear position of borrowings and code-switches
in Manambu, and to the question of morphological and syntactic calques from Tok
Pisin.
The position of borrowings and code-switches in a sentence, clause, and noun phrase in
Manambu presents a researcher with a number of puzzles. Moravcsik (1978) suggested that
a grammatical word can only be borrowed if the linear order with respect to its head is
also borrowed—that is, if a preposition is borrowed from language X into language Y, it
has to be borrowed as preposition, even if the language Y has nothing but postpositions.
(Also see Curnow 2001: 430–1 on a potential counterexample from Basque.) Manambu
partly follows Moravcsik’s prediction, and partly goes against it (also see Aikhenvald
forthcoming c).
In agreement with her prediction, borrowed or code-switched conjunctions keep the same
place in Manambu as they have in the source language—Tok Pisin. This is the case with o ‘or’
in T2.50, tasol ‘but’ in T2.3 and 22.7, and sapos ‘if’ in 22.8.

22.8 [sapos vitiyay-ad]
[ma:]

second-3masc.sgnom neg
‘If it is the second one (second child), this is no good (ﬁrst child is more important)’
The language-internal motivation behind this is that the few connectives Manambu has
occupy exactly the same position. The same applies to nau ‘then’ which occurs in the same
place in Manambu clauses as it does in the Tok Pisin spoken by the Manambu. This clausechaining insert accompanies the sequencing marker, and nau forms one phonological word
with the verb:
22.9 [Ya-tataka-nau]
ata wa-di
come-imm.seq-then then say-3plbas.p
‘On having come, they then said’
Within a noun phrase, non-agreeing adjectives of Tok Pisin extraction occupy the same place
as they would in Tok Pisin, and in Manambu, as shown in 22.17, and 22.10.
22.10 a
liklik ma:j wa-k@-tua
then little story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Then I will tell a little story’
A Tok Pisin indeﬁnite pronoun sampela ‘some’ or narapela ‘(an)other’ precedes a Tok
Pisin adjective, as would its Manambu equivalent n@k@- ‘(an)other, some’; it also precedes a
Manambu adjective, as in 22.11:61022 Genetic and Areal Relationships22.11 narapela ma:j wa-k@-tua
sampela kwasa
ma:j
(an)other story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt some
little+fem.sg story
‘I will tell another story, some little story (or other)’
A quantiﬁer planti ‘many’ precedes the noun, just like its Manambu equivalent samasa:m
(see 22.36); and a quantiﬁer olgeta ‘all’ follows the noun, just like Manambu aba:b ‘all’; 22.12b
was the speaker’s correction of his spontaneous code-switch in 22.12a.
22.12a ñan olgeta atawa kwa-na-dian
we all
thus stay-act.foc-1plbas.vt
‘We all stay like this’
22.12b ñan aba:b atawa kwa-na-dian
we all
thus stay-act.foc-1plbas.vt
‘We all stay like this’
In all the instances so far, the linear position of a Tok Pisin item was the same as that of its
Manambu counterpart. Not so for the numerals. We can recall, from §10.6.1, that numerals in
Manambu follow the head noun. In Tok Pisin, they precede it. When Tok Pisin wanpela ‘one, a’
appears in Manambu speech, it precedes the noun, following Moravcsik’s predictions that if a
term is borrowed, so is its linear order. Wanpela is quite frequent (and uniformly condemned as
‘bad language’). It appears with Tok Pisin nouns, as in 22.13–14, and with Manambu nouns, as
in 22.15–16 and 21.42 (where wanpela ta:kw (one:tp woman) is repeated as ta:kw nak (woman
one) ).

The Tok Pisin form wanpela precedes any adjective in a noun phrase; it is more often found
with Tok Pisin adjectives than with those from Manambu:
22.17 wanpela liklik ma:j aka
wa-k@-tua
one/a
little story dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I will tell one little story’
Occasionally, wanpela and nak ‘one’ occur in one noun phrase, reinforcing each other (as
in 21.42). We return to this in § 22.5.4. In all these instances, wanpela has nothing to do with
counting; it is an indeﬁnite introducer for a new referent. A story in Tok Pisin would start with22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English611wanpela plus a participant—so this use of wanpela in Tok Pisin is an obvious consequence of a
tendency to ‘match genres’ in languages in contact (see Aikhenvald 2006b: 27), that is, sharing
pragmatic patterns and the ways of organizing discourse structures.
Other borrowed numerals do not behave this way. They always precede foreign nouns, as in
T2.21 and T2.40 tu wik ‘two weeks’ (from English). Code-switching in numbers is considered a
mistake—in T2.40 the speaker corrected himself by saying wik (tp, e) viti ‘two weeks’; in T2.41
he used sande viti ‘two weeks’, lit. ‘two Sundays’.
If used with a Manambu noun, Tok Pisin numerals typically follow them, just as a Manambu
numeral would, thus going against Moravcsik’s prediction. These numbers are used for counting, and often occur accompanied by Manambu terms, in ‘parallel’ structures:
22.18 n@k@-di t@n@b
foa faiv a:li taba:b kwa-na-di
other-PL household four ﬁve four ﬁve
stay-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Other (clan) households are four (or) ﬁve, four (or) ﬁve’
English and Tok Pisin terms are often used for numbers bigger than ten (as in T2.65)—see
§22.4.3 below, on the motivation for this.
The Tok Pisin preposition and adverb wantaim occurs in Manambu as a postposition, replacing the postposition wuk@n ‘together, with’ (see §4.5, and 4.68–9). The postposition wantaim is
used by younger speakers, and is considered highly substandard. An example spontaneously
produced is in 22.19:
22.19 m@n-a
wantaim yi-k-na-bran
you.masc-lk with
go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
‘We will go together with you; you and I will go together’
Other numerous code-switches involve pro-clauses, e.g. orait ‘OK’ often used similarly to
Manambu ya:kya ‘OK’ (see §20.4.2) (also see T2.50, T2.60, T2.65), em nau ‘this is it’, and em
tasol ‘this is it, just this’. They are not morphologically or syntactically integrated. The question
about whether they can be assigned to a Manambu word class remains open.
As we saw at the end of §4.5, the word class assignment for a number of Tok Pisin inserts is
problematic (this may justify considering them as code-switches rather than borrowings). One
such problematic word is the modal mas ‘must’ (from Tok Pisin mas) which—unlike any other
modal—can occur with an imperative-marked verb as in 13.22. Another one is tabu, from Tok
Pisin tambu, ‘be prohibited’. This form never occurs inﬂected. It can head a predicate, as in
22.20:
g@ñ@r warya-wari tabu
22.20 Apat@pa-wa
Avatip+lk-com later ﬁght-red forbidden
‘Later on it was forbidden to ﬁght with Avatip’
Or it may form one constituent with an inﬂected verb in non-future or in future, in what
superﬁcially looks like a complement clause construction, as in 22.21–2:
22.21 abra-wur
b@yib ñan tabu
r@-bana
dem.dist+du-up stream we forbidden sit-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
aka-n-aka
dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg

‘There is no hitting them, it is forbidden for me to hit (them)’ (lit. I am forbidden I will
hit)
In terms of its synchronic status, tabu forms a subclass of its own.
The Tok Pisin completive marker pinis also behaves in an unusual way when it occurs in
Manambu speech. It can head a predicate (and be modiﬁed by olgeta ‘altogether’, also from
Tok Pisin), as in 22.23, or form a whole clause, as in 22.24 (where it is preceded by a pause):
22.23 ata S@ruali pinis olgeta
ata kus@-taka-d

22.24 ka-n

compl
‘After they had eaten they got up, and it was all over’
If accompanied by an inﬂected verb, as in 22.25, it may be interpreted as an aspect marker: its
position is the same as that of the Tok Pisin pinis.
22.25 vya-da-k
olgeta
pinis
hit-3pl-compl.ds altogether compl
‘Having completely killed all . . . ’
Mas, tabu, and pinis may be interpreted as tokens of incipient ‘loan’ morphology in Manambu
(see §4.5.6).
Syntactic and morphological calques from Tok Pisin are diﬃcult to identify because of the
nature of Tok Pisin as a Creole language. Any structural similarity between Tok Pisin and
Manambu may well be due to the indigenous substratum in Tok Pisin itself rather than its
inﬂuence on Manambu. Such similarities include some compounds, e.g. Manambu mæn-ta:b
(leg-hand), Tok Pisin lekhan ‘hands and feet’, the polysemy of Manambu vya- ‘hit, kill’ and
Tok Pisin kilim, and numerous others.
If the Manambu patterns used by frequent code-switchers into Tok Pisin (most, but not
all, of whom are younger than 40–50) diﬀer from those employed by traditional speakers and
display striking structural similarity to Tok Pisin, we can suspect that calquing is at work. For
instance, code-switchers tend to use the postposition wuk@n in many contexts where a comitative would be expected (see §7.9), and even replace it with wantaim (see above). This reﬂects a
tendency towards analytic constructions possibly developed under Tok Pisin inﬂuence. Codeswitchers display more frequent verb-medial order than traditional speakers, which may again
be due to the Tok Pisin inﬂuence (traditional speakers have a pronounced verb-ﬁnal tendency
in their constituent order).
The more Tok Pisin the person uses, the more impoverished their Manambu sounds—such
speakers would prefer series of juxtaposed clauses to clause chains (see Chapters 18–19), and
would rarely use certain clause-chaining markers, such as -taka ‘immediate sequence’. This
takes us to the issue of incipient language obsolescence—taken up in §22.6.1.","[634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639]"
"4.5.6 Word class assignment of loans and code-switches
Most loanwords and code-switches ﬁt squarely into the system of word classes in Manambu:
nouns are borrowed as nouns, and verbs are borrowed either as inﬂected verbs, or as nominals
used exclusively in the copula complement function (see §4.1.2).
Adjectives, such as grin ‘green’, blu ‘blue’, rait ‘right’, and lapun ‘old’, are borrowed as
non-agreeing adjectives. Some borrowings and code-switches behave in the same way as the
Manambu words they ‘translate’. Orait and okey are functional equivalents of ya:kya ‘OK’,
and belong to the same class. The same applies for the English yes which occasionally replaces
ay@y.
The word class assignment for other loans is problematic. The borrowed numeral ‘one’,
wanpela (from Tok Pisin wanpela), and the borrowed quantiﬁer planti (Tok Pisin planti
‘many’) diﬀer from their indigenous counterparts in that they precede the head noun,
while the Manambu word follows it, as is the case with nak ‘one’, e.g. wanpela ta:kw
(one:TP woman), ta:kw nak (woman one) ‘one woman’ (see Aikhenvald forthcoming c).
Or the Manambu word may either precede or follow the head noun (see §10.5), e.g.
planti ta:kw (many woman), ta:kw samasa:m, samasam-a ta:kw (woman many, many-lk
woman) ‘many women’. These borrowed quantiﬁers can be considered special subclasses of
quantiﬁers.
9Some speakers accept ma: ‘no’ rather than ayey as an aﬃrmative answer to 4.83.",[137]

This is a grammar of Manambu, a language of the Ndu family, which is, in terms of numbers of
speakers, the largest language family of the Sepik area of New Guinea. Manambu is spoken by
about 2,500 people in ﬁve villages—three of which, Avatip, Malu, and Yambon, are suﬃciently
big to appear on most maps of Papua New Guinea. I started studying the language in 1995,
as part of my work on classiﬁers, genders, and noun classes. I was interested in learning a
language with shape-based genders. Alan Rumsey was teaching a ﬁeld methods course at
the ANU, with Pauline Agnes Luma Laki as a consultant. I came along to the course, and
then carried on working with Pauline for more than ten years afterwards—this is how my
voyage of discovery started. I have since worked with several dozen speakers of Manambu,
mostly in Avatip. Pauline Agnes Luma Laki and myself are currently engaged in preparing a
comprehensive dictionary of the language.
This grammar contains an analysis of the Manambu language, starting from a brief characterization of the language and its speakers, then going on to phonology, morphology, syntax,
discourse organization, and semantics. The analysis is cast in terms of a cumulative typological
framework of linguistic analysis—which employs ‘the fundamental theoretical concepts that
underlie all work in language description and change’ (Dixon 1997: 128) and in terms of which
signiﬁcant typological generalizations are postulated; this has come to be called ‘basic linguistic
theory’. I have avoided employing any transient formalisms. This grammar is part of genuine
documentation of the Manambu language in its varied facets.
Every chapter of the grammar includes a presentation of the facts of the language interwoven
with arguments for their analysis within a typological framework. No attempt has been made
to separate pure ‘description’ from theoretical interpretation—which would not be a productive
task. A typological perspective for each phenomenon is crucial for the analysis given here.
Detailed exempliﬁcation is provided for every grammatical point. Most examples come
from texts, and a few from spontaneous—or carefully directed—conversation. An additional
objective was to convey as much of the Manambu culture as possible through using naturally
occurring examples. I avoid using elicited sentences; elicitation was limited to lexicon and to
paradigms.
English glosses are kept as close as possible to the glosses and explanations oﬀered by
my consultants. Readers should be warned against trying to draw conclusions concerning
Manambu grammar and semantics from study of the translations.
Examples, tables, diagrams, ﬁgures, charts, and footnotes are numbered separately within
each chapter. Footnotes are also numbered separately for each chapter. The orthography used
in the examples from languages other than Manambu, and language names, follows that of the
sources (unless indicated otherwise).
This grammar can be used as a sourcebook for further typological studies, and as a model
for further grammars of languages of the Ndu and of other families of the New Guinea area.
It is far from being the last word on Manambu—the grammar is intended to provide a sound
systematic foundation for further studies, reanalyses, and reinterpretations.
It is my hope that this book will encourage linguists to go out into the ﬁeld and document
languages threatened by extinction (before it is too late to do so). Nothing can compare with
the intellectual excitement of working out the grammatical system of a previously undescribed
language.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"4.5 Closed classes105The postposition wuk@n ‘together’ (homonymous with the sequential form wuk@-n (hearseq.manner) ‘hearing, understanding, feeling’) does not require a linker on the noun it governs.
It marks the second subject participant in the argument elaboration (‘inclusory’) construction
(§6.2.3), as in 4.68 and 6.38.
4.68 an
[Aulapan wuk@n] Sarak-abran
we.du Aulapan with
Sarak-1dunom
‘The two of us, Aulapan and I, are of the Sarak clan’
It can also mark an oblique participant which is not cross-referenced, e.g. ‘with his mother’
in 4.69:
4.69 ata wuk@-ku
gra-dian
[d@-k@
amæy wuk@n]
then hear/feel-compl.ss cry-1plbas.p he-obl+fem.sg mother with
ata gra-dian
d@-k@
ma:k v@-ma:r-ku
3masc.sg-obl+3fem.sg person see-neg.sub-compl.ss then cry-1plbas.p
‘Then feeling sorry (for the missing boy) we (all) cried, together with his mother, not
having seen him in person (and suspecting the worst), we then cried’
It can occur on its own if the noun is recoverable from the context, as in 4.70:
4.70 wuk@n a-kray
with impv-bring
‘Bring (glasses) with you!’
The postposition wuk@n is similar in meaning to the comitative case (see §7.9). The diﬀerence
is the degree of participation: if all the participants are equally involved, comitative is used. If
not, wuk@n is preferred. A speaker said 4.71, rather than 4.72, because an 11-year-old, however
smart, could not be an equal participant in an adult women’s job of going to a market to sell
and buy things.
4.71 maketar
l@-k@
wuk@n yi-k-na-bran
market+all she-obl with go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
‘We two will go to the market, (me) with her (11-year-old girl)’
4.72 l@-k@-wa
yi-k-na-bran
she-obl-com go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
‘We two will (go to the market), (me) with her’
Younger speakers who frequently code-switch with Tok Pisin replace wuk@n with its synonym, the Tok Pisin code-switch wantaim, e.g. m@n-a wantaim, m@n wuk@n ‘with you (masculine)’. Some use wuk@n in the context where a comitative is expected; 4.73 is an example
of wuk@n—spontaneously produced by Janet and addressed to her daughter, Joana—where
a double comitative construction (§7.9 and §6.2.3) would have been more appropriate for a
traditional speaker.

4.74 [ [Kay-a-wa Harold-ad]focus
wuk@n] kwa-tu@-l
Kay-lk-com Harold-3masc.sgnom with
stay-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
gabu-ma:j-a
traditional-story-3fem.sgnom
‘This is the story of me staying together with (focused) Harold and Kay’
Just like k@t@k, an NP containing this postposition can occur in the predicate slot. It cannot
occupy the copula complement slot, or be used as a modiﬁer or an argument of the verb unless
it occurs as part of the argument elaboration construction, as in 4.71–2.
The postposition kuk@- ‘at the back of; behind; after’ is only superﬁcially similar to the other
two postpositions. The root kuk@- takes three local cases: locative, with the meaning ‘behind’, as
in d@-k@ kuk-@-m r @-d-@ du (he-obl behind-lk-loc sit-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk man) ‘a man sitting
behind him’; allative, with the meaning of ‘towards the direction of behind something’, as in
4.75; and terminative, meaning ‘exactly behind something’, as in 4.61 above. It always requires
a linker. In these respect it is noun-like (however, it is not used as a noun, ‘back’).
4.75 [ñan-a kuk-@-r]
ya-n
væki-n
t@-na-di
we.pl-lk back-lk-all come-seq go.across-seq stand-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘(Soldiers) were coming across towards behind us’
An NP containing kuk@- can modify a noun. [Yuajan kuk-@-b-a] du (Yuajan:female.name
behind-lk-term-lk man) means ‘male (son) (born) after Yuajan’; this was used to describe the
sequence of children, by Gemaj. This example also shows that the spatial meaning ‘behind’ is
extended to temporal, ‘after’ (also see 13.43).
Any of the case forms of kuk@- can be used without an argument, that is, similarly to a
locative adverb. Sometimes the argument of kuk@- can be recovered from the context, as in the
mother’s answer to my question why the baby was crying, under 13.43 (‘she wants to go out
after (her)’). No such argument is ‘recoverable’ in 4.76—this is an example of an adverbial-like
use of kuk@-:
4.76 wun k@ka-n-aka
bla-tu@-l
kuk-@-m
I
dem.prox.react.top-pred-react.top talk-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p back-lk-loc
‘Here (I am), this is what I said afterwards’
Just like any other adverb (Table 4.4), a case-marked form of kuk@- can be used as
a modiﬁer of a noun, e.g. kuk@r ñan (behind+all child) ‘last child’, kuk@-s@buk (backhigh.degree.of.initiated.man) ‘the most senior of simbuks’ (also used for ‘high priest’, in Bible
translation).
Unlike any other postpositions, but similarly to body part terms, kuk@- can appear in part–
whole possessive constructions, as in kuk@-tag (back-tank) ‘back of the (water)tank’, kuk@-ab
‘back of the head’, kuk@-t@k@r (back-chair) ‘back of the chair’, kuk@-wi ‘back of the house’
combining the reference to the back part of something and to the spatial orientation. This
construction type is typical for body part and spatial orientation terms: compare mutam ‘face’,
mut@m-a-wi (face-lk-house) ‘in front of the house’, mut@m-a-t@k@r ‘in front of the chair’, ma:l
‘side’, mal-a-wi (side-lk-house) ‘side of the house’, and so on. (The question of what is the
head in these constructions is addressed in §8.1.2.)
The only diﬀerence between body part terms and kuk@- is that kuk@- does not occur on its
own, and can only take the three locational cases. In addition, a part–whole construction with4.5 Closed classes107kuk@- cannot be paraphrased with any other possessive construction (§8.1.2). That is, mut@ma-wi (face-lk-house) ‘in front of the house’ can be rephrased (with a change in meaning) as
wi l@-k@ mutam (house 3fem.sg-obl+fem.sg face) ‘the front, or the face, of the house’; while
kuk@-wi cannot be paraphrased in the same way.
Occasionally, kuk@- can occur in the headless possessive construction marked with the
possessive suﬃx -k@-, as in 4.77:
4.77 a-d@
[ta:y kaw] væ-ku,
[kuk@-k@-d@
kaw] ata
dem.dist-masc.sg before hole dig-compl.ss back-poss-masc.sg hole then
væ-br@-d
dig-3dusubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
‘Having dug the ﬁrst hole, having put up the fence, having come there, then they dug the
next hole (lit. the hole belonging to the back), having stood up the fence’
Similarly to a noun, the form kuk@- appears in a few modiﬁer-noun compounds (see §9.3),
e.g. kuk@-ya:b (back-road) ‘sideroad’. Some of these are somewhat unpredictable in meaning:
kuk@-m@l v@- (back-eye see) means ‘look back’ (as in 21.15).
Two analytic options arise. We can consider kuk@- a special kind of ‘bound’ body part and
orientational noun, since it shares a number of syntactic properties with them, but never occurs
on its own. Or we can consider it a special word class: a bound noun which forms the base for
the spatial postpositions ‘behind’, and shares similarities with the two other postpositions,
k@t@k ‘like’ and wuk@n ‘with’ which have no corresponding bound noun forms. Both analyses
are adequate. I opt for the second one simply because of the syntactic similarities between the
postpositional structures.
In summary: postpositions form a heterogeneous class. They appear to be a Manambu
innovation, given that other Ndu languages appear not to have any postpositions.","[131, 132, 133, 134]"
"10.5 Quantiﬁers231Motuway, who was sitting next to me chatting at a prayer meeting, missed the number of
the verse the preacher told everyone to read; she then asked (see 19.104 for kas in a reported
question):
10.113 vers kas
wa-na-d
verse how.much/many say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘Which verse (by number) did he say?’
Unlike any other interrogative (but similar to a noun), kas can be reduplicated yielding a
distributive meaning, as in 10.114:
10.114 kas-@-kas
yapi-kwa-na-di?
how.much/many-lk-how.much/many sell/pay-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘For how much do they sell each of these?’ (referring to cucumbers, sold individually at
a local market)
A questioned constituent can be part of the main (ﬁnal) clause, or of medial completive
clause (§18.3; also see example 9.33). Within a main clause, two constituents can be questioned,
as in 10.115.
10.115 akr@l
s@-k@-m
vyak?
where.to who-obl-acc/loc hit+purp.ss
‘Where are you going to hit whom?’
Two constituents in a medial clause cannot be questioned simultaneously; neither can one
constituent in the main clause, and one in the medial clause. That questions are a separate
clause type, diﬀerent from declarative clauses, is corroborated by the way in which they are
negated (as shown in 10.107); see §14.5.2 and also §20.1.3.10.5 q ua n t i f i e r s
Quantiﬁers are a closed class of a couple of dozen members, covering the semantics of quantity
and arrangement. Quantiﬁers refer to large quantity; these include samasa:m ‘many’, æywan
‘quite a few (less than samasa:m)’, and its synonym mæy@k ‘many’ in the Malu variety. Two
frequently used quantiﬁers with the meaning of ‘all’ are miyawa ‘all’ and aba:b ‘all, all together’.
Speakers who frequently code-switch with Tok Pisin also use the quantiﬁer sampela ‘some’, as
in 10.17.
These quantiﬁers can be used as modiﬁers to nouns, to verbs, and as heads of predicate.
When used as modiﬁers to nouns, a quantiﬁer can either precede or follow the noun, depending on its discourse status. A newly introduced or a non-topical referent is followed by the
quantiﬁer, as in 10.116. Once the referent has been established, the quantiﬁer precedes it. We
will see in §10.6 that numerals operate on a similar principle. In the very beginning of a story
(10.116) the speaker states that her foster father used to do a lot of work.
10.116 d@ yawi samasa:m kur-kwa-na-d
do-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
he work much
‘He used to do a lot of work’
She then goes on to describe exactly what he did, and ﬁnally says 10.117.
10.117 samasam-a yawi kur-kwa-na-d
much-lk
work do-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘(He) used to do a lot of the work (mentioned already)’23210 Closed ClassesUnlike numerals (but similarly to non-agreeing adjectives), the quantiﬁers take a linker when
used as preposed modiﬁers within NPs. Similarly to numerals (e.g. 7.50), they do not take case
markers, even when used as posthead modiﬁers (the case marker then goes onto the noun
head). The only quantiﬁer which can only be used postposed to the head is the interrogative
kas ‘how many/much’ (§10.4).
All quantiﬁers can be used with countable and uncountable referents, except for aba:b ‘all’
which is preferred with countable referents. Its counterpart with uncountable and collective
referents is the quantiﬁer miya-wa (tree+lk-com) ‘all, whole’ (this contains the comitative in
a derivational function (§7.9, under E) and does not take any additional linker), e.g. aba:b-a
du-ta:kw (all-lk man-woman) ‘all the people (one by one)’, miyawa du-ta:kw ‘all the people as
a group’ (10.123); miyawa t@ p ‘the whole village (as a group)’. An NP of the form ?aba:b-a t@ p
is barely acceptable.
The quantiﬁer aba:b ‘all’ can be used headlessly, as in 10.78. A preacher addressed his
congregation by saying vyak@t-a gan@b aba:b (good-lk morning all) ‘good morning all (of
you)’. A frequent headless use of this quantiﬁer may be due to calquing from Tok Pisin olgeta
‘all’.
We saw in §7.9 (under E) that the comitative case can derive nouns with quantiﬁcational
meanings, such as t@pawa (village+lk+com) ‘the whole village; all villagers together’.
The number agreement of a verb or an agreeing modiﬁer with an NP containing a quantiﬁer
depends on the countability of the referent, and the degree of individualization: if samasama du-ta:kw (many-lk man-woman) ‘many people’ is treated as one non-diﬀerentiated group,
agreement is singular; if they are to be discussed as a set of groups, or individuals, agreement is
plural. Quantiﬁers modify nouns and verbs. Quantiﬁers as modiﬁer to verbs are illustrated in
10.118–19, and T3.43 (miyawa ‘all’).

‘Then she worried a lot again’
In 10.120, a quantiﬁer modiﬁes a copula complement (and acquires an intensifying meaning). This is the only way of intensifying a copula complement, e.g. n@k@r samasa:m tay-na
(cold much be.nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘it is very cold’.

In 10.121, a quantiﬁer heads a predicate: it then takes nominal cross-referencing, as do most
non-verbs in this slot (see §3.1).
10.121 b@

The form samasa:m has an inherently reduplicated form; the component sam- appears in a

In 12.23, -tu- indicates that all the O were involved:
12.23 na:gw vya-wuta-tu-l@-di
sago hit-break.in.two-many-3fem.sgsubj.p-3plbas.p
‘She broke all the (branches) of sago palm’
The suﬃx -tu- refers to S of an ambitransitive verb, thus showing that it is used intransitively,
as in 12.24. We can recall, from §7.2, that gu in examples like 12.24 is part of a complex
ambitransitive verb and not its object. Not surprisingly, -tu- in 12.24 refers to people who
washed themselves fully, and not to the water:
12.24 gu
ata yaku-tu-di
water then wash-many-3plbas.vt/p
‘Then they washed (fully)’
The suﬃx -tu- is often used with verbs of aﬀect. It is likely to be cognate to the Wosera suﬃx
-to- ‘all’ (Wilson 1980: 63).12.5 c o n f i r m at i o n m a r k e r
The conﬁrmation marker -@k stresses that the action or state has taken place or is happening.
This marker occupies the very last place within an inﬂected verb (see Scheme 11.2) and occurs
on verbs, and on non-verbal predicates (see Scheme 11.3), provided these have a ﬁrst or second
person subject (as in 12.25–7), or ﬁrst or second person object (as in T3.8). That is, this suﬃx
can only be used with speech act participants. In 12.25, the conﬁrmation marker goes onto a
nominal head of predicate and onto the verb in a following clause.

answered:

‘Already indeed! (that is, I have already!)’
In 12.5 (‘I have come’), the conﬁrmation marker co-occurs with the action focus, and in
10.60 it occurs on a verb marked with habitual aspect.
The conﬁrmation marker can occur with future, provided the point in time is deﬁned, as in
T3.7 and T3.40 (‘today you will die’). The conﬁrmation marker occurs in rhetorical questions,
as in 12.27, but not in information questions:26212 Verbal Categories12.27 ñ@n

‘What (on earth) have you done!’
The conﬁrmation marker is not compatible with negation.12.6 c o m p l e t i v e a s p e c t
Completive aspect is marked with the suﬃx -Vm, the same as the locative case (see the
discussion at §7.11). Its meaning conveys completion of an action or total achievement of a
state. As was shown in §7.11, this marker can attach to a verbal root, as in 7.85, 12.7 (second
line), and 12.28.

This same marker occurs on adjectives in the predicate slot, as in 12.29:
12.29 kuprap-@-m
bad-lk-compl
‘It is irredeemably bad’
To be used in dependent clauses or to take further person or modality expressions, the
completive form requires the support verb na- ‘copula for abstract states’. This is in contrast to
other uninﬂected verbs, which are used with the functionally unmarked support verb t@- ‘be,
stand’. The support verb occurs in main clauses if the tense and person, number and gender
speciﬁcations are required:

‘You won’t be short (of anything), you are ﬁne as far as small things are concerned’
The support verb is obligatory in subordinate clauses—see the second clause in 12.31. In the
ﬁrst clause of 12.31 the copula is omitted, since this is a main clause, and no extra speciﬁcations
are required: they are clear from the context.

kind of earth away?” ’
Some nominal-like forms containing formative -Vm which cannot be omitted occur as
complements of the copula na- ‘be: natural phenomena or abstract state’. These could be
instances of fossilized completive, e.g. katelam na- ‘be light (of daylight)’, karyam na- ‘be almost
light’ (of daylight), tugwam na- ‘be clear, have clear vision’.
The completive aspect cannot be used in commands; nor is there any form which can be
used instead. One reason for this gap is semantic: it focuses on the full completion of the
action, and commands in Manambu do not convey such meanings. The other reason is formal:
the completive aspect is an uninﬂected verb used as copula complement of the ‘abstract state’
copula na-. This copula does not have an imperative, and hardly ever occurs in commands of
any sort.12.7 c u s t o m a ry a s p e c t
The customary aspect is marked with the suﬃx -j@b@r , and means ‘usually, always or continuously do’. It can head the predicate of an independent clause without a copula, if person,
number, gender, or additional aspect meanings do not have to be speciﬁed, as in 12.32 and
6.39.

In 12.17, ‘he always used to eat’, the customary form appears in the copula complement slot.
As expected, the copula, t@-, carries all the grammatical markers. A similar example is at 12.33.

Unlike the habitual and the completive aspects, the customary aspect can occur in negative
and prohibitive constructions. In all such cases it has to occur with the copula t@-.
12.34 yaki k@-j@b@r t@-tukwa

dem.dist-masc.sg drum get-cust go.up-3masc.sgbas.vt/p
‘He went up always clinging (lit. getting) to the drum’
If a verb carrying the marker of the customary aspect heads the predicate of a dependent clause,
the copula t@- is used—this is a typical property of an uninﬂected verb:26412 Verbal Categories12.36 [d@ ata k@tay

‘Then he, keeping looking around, sounded the drum’
However, unlike any other uninﬂected verb, verbs marked with customary aspect oﬀer an
option of taking a medial clause marker directly. Examples 12.37–8 illustrate a number of
medial clause markers used this way:
laku-k@-tua-di
12.37 v@-j@b@r-ta:y

‘After her having always ﬁnished the job (building the house), they eat food later’
Examples like 12.37–8 are characteristic of speakers of all generations. It is unlikely that they
are a recent innovation. In male songs about foiled marriages, verbal forms marked with -j@b@r
function as fully inﬂected verbs, taking person, number, and gender marking. Example 12.39
comes from Harrison (1983: 62).

‘The ladder Magad@mi is there’
Such examples are not found in everyday speech. We can hypothesize that, in the past, verbs
with the marker -j@b@r could have been fully inﬂected, similarly to the compound verbs with
aspectual meanings discussed in §15.3.12.8 e x p r e s s i n g i n t e n s i v e , continuous, a n d r e p e at e d ac t i o n s
Intensive and continuous actions can be marked in a variety of ways, including
(i) one of the derivational suﬃxes discussed in §9.2—see §12.8.1;
(ii) reduplication of the verb root—see §12.8.2, and
(iii) repetition of the verb—see §12.8.3.","[287, 288, 289, 290, 291]"
"2.1 Segmental phonology43C. Allophonic Variation
The low front [æ] is in free variation with [ε] and [e], as in bæy, bεy, bey ‘mat; feast’. If followed
by a palatal glide y, it may alternate with back low vowel [a:], e.g. variants amæy and ama:y
‘mother’; and bæy, ba:y ‘mat; feast’. However, not every long a: followed by y alternates
with æ: awá:y ‘mother’s brother’ is never pronounced as ∗ [aw""æy]. The vowel a is sometimes
pronounced as [æ] following the palatal glide y in an unstressed syllable, e.g. vyabad´@l ‘hit
him is what we did’ is sometimes heard as [vyæm ban d""@l]. This is restricted to rapid speech by
younger people.
The phoneme @ has the following additional allophones depending on whether it is preceded
or followed by a glide. 11
/@/ > [u] if preceded or followed by a labial consonant, e.g. nakamúy, nakam´@ y ‘one’,
Manáb@ kudí, Manábu kudí [ma""nam b@ ku""n di, ma""nam bu ku""n di] ‘Manambu language’,
w@ká, wuká ‘this here’, m´@ya, máya ‘really’, n@má, numá ‘big’, ñám@s, ñámus ‘younger
sibling’, t@kwaná, tukwaná ‘she stays’;
or
if the adjacent syllable contains the vowel u, e.g. t@kú, tukú ‘having been’, r @ku, ruku ‘having
sat’; an alternative pronunciation in this context is r @uku, t@uku.
/@/ > i if preceded by y in an unstressed syllable: y@ná, yiná ‘she goes/is’.
These processes apply within a phonological word (see §2.3.4, under II). Speakers vary as to
how distinctively they pronounce @ as u or as i under these conditions: for instance, the same
speaker pronounced a name once as Tabam@y and then as Tabamuy. If the vowel @ is stressed,
the vocalic realization u is more frequent, e.g. [ab""un] (rather than [ab""@n]) ‘six’, [wun] ‘I’ (rather
that w´@n), but [ab@tí] ‘seven’ (see §10.6).
The underlying allophones of @ can be distinguished from u and i by the lack of variation:
if u or i is an allophone of @ it will have variants with @ as shown below, while forms with
phonemically distinctive u and i do not have such variants, e.g. du ‘man’, di ‘shit’.
If the ﬁrst syllable of a disyllabic word contains u, the vowel @ in the second syllable is also
pronounced as u, especially in rapid register and if stressed, as in mugúl, m@gw´@l [mu""n gul,
m@""n gw @l] ‘three, few’. In a number of minimal pairs u and @w, and i and @y, do contrast, e.g.
mu ‘crocodile; the day after tomorrow’, m@w ‘base of’; mi ‘tree’, mír ‘upwards’, m´@yir ‘really’;
yi ‘ﬁre’, ay´@i ‘yes’. The contrast between i and æy is corroborated by the pair mi ‘tree’ versus
mæy ‘come’; and between i and @ by yi ‘ﬁre’ versus (ma:) y@ ‘(not) go’, (ma:) ki ‘(not) die’
versus (ma:) k@ ‘(not) eat’. Phonemes i , @, and æi contrast in yi ‘ﬁre’ versus (ma:) y@ ‘(not)
go’ versus (ma:) yæi ‘(not) come’. (The latter two tend to be neutralized in the Malu variety.)
Phonemes i and u contrast with other vowels, e.g. k@dí ‘these’, kadí ‘they paddle’, and kudí
‘language, mouth’. Optional rounding applies to unstressed a in normal register in the context
of a labial nasal, e.g. [samas""a:m, sa» ma» s""a:m] ‘many’.
Vowels æ, æ:, i:, and u: never occur in suﬃxes. The vowel @ never occupies a root-initial
position. We will also see, in §2.3.2, that @ often occurs as a product of vowel reduction
in an unstressed syllable. In addition, the vowel @ can be inserted automatically to break
unauthorized consonant clusters (see §2.2.1).
11 This allophonic variation of the central vowel @ is reminiscent of that in other Ndu languages, especially Iatmul
and Hanga Kundi, and agrees with the analysis by Allen and Hurd (1972).","[69, 70]"

Neither the possessor nor the possessed can consist of a noun plus a modiﬁer. The possessed
noun is the head of the construction, since it determines gender and number agreement. A
noun phrase n@ma-d@ tama-val (big-masc.sg nose+lk-canoe) ‘big nose (front part) of a canoe’
means ‘big nose of a canoe’, not ∗ ‘nose of a big canoe’. The ‘possessor’ can be omitted: instead
of saying gala-taba:m atak (the.fork.like.part+lk-hand+lk+loc impv+put) ‘put (the medicine)
in the fork-like part of the hand (between ﬁngers)’, one can say: gal:am a-tak! ‘put (it) in the
fork-like part’.
B. Possessive noun phrases with juxtaposed components have no restrictions on the animacy
of the possessor or of the possessed. The meaning of the construction covers a broad semantic
range, from possession proper to association with the possessor. A possessor—which precedes
the possessed—can be a noun or a pronoun with a speciﬁc referent, e.g. ta:kw ya:b ‘(a) woman’s
road’, Yuaya:b amæy ‘Yuaya:b’s mother’, jag@r sa:p (garﬁsh character) ‘character or image of
a garﬁsh’, bal ya:m (pig smell) ‘smell of a (dead) pig’, wun amæy ‘my mother’.
These constructions can never be treated as compounds. Either the possessor or the possessed can consist of noun phrases with a modiﬁer, e.g. [k@-d@ t@p] wa:ñ (dem.prox-masc.sg
village line) ‘the line of this village’, wun [kwasa ñan] (I small+fem.sg child) ‘my small child’.
The possessor can be a coordinate NP, e.g. [m@r@-wa wa:l] p@pli (wind+lk-com rain noise) ‘loud
noise of [rain and wind]’.
The possessed noun is the head, since it determines the gender and number agreement. In
8.1, the feminine cross-referencing on the possessive NP (in brackets) indicates agreement with
the feminine noun wa:ñ ‘genealogical line’ (the feminine gender is used here because the line is
small).

‘This is why this is the line of this village’
A possessive NP of this type can be discontinuous, as in 8.2 where the adverb kwasa ‘a
little’ intervenes between possessor and possessed. (That kwasa is indeed an adverb and not
a feminine singular agreement form of the adjective kwasa ‘small’ is corroborated by the fact
that ‘I’ has a male referent in this example, and ‘head’ triggers masculine agreement on the
predicate because of the headache which makes it feel big and heavy, similarly to 5.9 in §5.2.1.)
8.2 [wun kwasa ab] la:n-ad

Multiple and embedded possessors (not more than two) are allowed, e.g. amæy asa:y t@p
(mother father village) ‘village of [mother and father]’, Yuakalu wi væs ([ [Yuakalu [house] ]
[grass] ]) ‘grass of the house belonging to Yuakalu’. There are no examples of multiple possessees (e.g. ‘our mother and father’) in the corpus; I suspect that this does not occur. Speakers
who often code-switch with Tok Pisin use Tok Pisin-like juxtaposed possessive constructions
more frequently than others. The surface parallel between juxtaposed structures in Tok Pisin
and in Manambu is illustrated in 8.3. The Tok Pisin forms are underlined.

Yipawal ‘where is your house?’ Since Yipawal is a woman, it would have made no sense for
her to refer to herself with masculine gender, so the gender agreement on the demonstrative
must be with the unstated head—here, the house.

C. Possessive noun phrases with a linker have no restrictions on the animacy of possessor
or possessed. Just as in type B, the meaning of the construction covers a broad range, from
possession proper to an association with the possessor. Unlike the type A, the possessor
precedes the possessed and typically has non-speciﬁc reference, e.g. takwa ya:b (woman+lk
road) ‘female road’, du-a ya:b (man-lk road) ‘male road’; t@p-a kudi (village-lk talk) ‘the
village language’ (Tok Pisin tok ples). The possessor cannot have an inherently deﬁnite referent;
as a consequence, pronouns and proper names do not occur in these constructions.
Possessive constructions with a linker often lexicalize, e.g. ab-a-wapwi (head-lk-dress) ‘headdress, hat’; ap-a-s@ (bone-lk-name) ‘ﬁrst name’, taba-ñ@ (hand+lk-sun) ‘wrist watch’. They
are similar to the part–whole constructions in that if they contain no more than three syllables,
they form one phonological word (in agreement with §2.5.1). That is, they can be realized as
compounds, depending on the number of syllables they contain (also see §9.3).
Possessive constructions of type A can form part of a type B construction (PossessorPossessed), as in 8.5. This describes a post belonging to a location (back) within the house:
kwa:t]b.poss
8.5 [ [baga-wi-a]a.poss
back+lk-house-lk post
‘post of the back of the house’
The possessed noun is the head of the construction since it determines number and gender
agreement, as shown in 8.6. The head cannot be omitted, and multiple possessors are not
acceptable. A possessive NP with a linker cannot be discontinuous; neither the possessor nor
the possessed can consist of a noun plus a modiﬁer.
8.6 a-b@r
ab-a-wapwi
viti-ab@r
dem.dist-du head-lk-dress two-3dunom
‘Those hats (lit. headdresses) are two’
D. NPs with pronominal possessive marker are of two kinds: either possessor is a personal
pronoun or possessor is a noun and there is an additional pronominal marker of possession.
D1. If the possessor is a personal pronoun, the pronoun itself serves as a possession marker.
Agreement in gender and number is always marked on the pronoun (see §5.1.1). Third person
singular and dual (non-plural) pronouns, and the interrogative s@ ‘who?’ take the oblique
marker -k@- (same as the one in case formation: §7.1).
8.7 aw wun-a-di away-b@r-adi
then I-lk-3pl mother’s.brother-pl-3plnom
‘Then they are my mother’s brothers’
These constructions are preferred to possessive constructions with juxtaposition (type B above)
if the possession or the possessor are in contrastive focus (which one is in focus is usually
clear from the context). A modiﬁer can intervene between the possessor and the possessed, as
in 8.8.","[196, 197, 198]"
"22.2 The Kwoma–Manambu relationship597of the other, they come to borrow linguistic features and forms of all kinds. The extent of this
varies; but no feature is absolutely borrowing proof (see Aikhenvald 2006b).
Languages which are not in contact with each other may have borrowed the same form—
or the same pattern—from some common source, or from diﬀerent sources (see Tosco 2000
on the notion of shared substrata). The fact that numerous languages of the Sepik area share
the term yaki for tobacco (Yimas yaki, Arafundi Pidgin yaki, Alamblak Pidgin yagi (Foley
2005b), Karawari, Awiyakay yaki) does not imply that they were in actual contact with Iatmul,
the ultimate source for this form. The form yaki could have been borrowed into Yimas and
Karawari independently from Iatmul-based pidgin(s) (given the importance of Iatmul as a
trade language). Awiyakay may have borrowed this form from Karawari (Darja Hoenigman,
p.c.), from a Iatmul-based pidgin, or from another, unidentiﬁable, source. Manambu has the
same form, shared with Iatmul—and this could be either a common inheritance or, again, a
loan from some shared source. (Also see Riesenfeld 1951, for another hypothesis. 3 )
A commonality can be due to the interaction of all these features. An additional process
may involve reinforcement, or lexico-grammatical accommodation, whereby a form existing in
a language is adjusted to one found in a neighbouring language (Aikhenvald 2006b provides
examples of such processes). One such instance could be the term for ‘dog’ in Manambu and
in Kwoma. We return to this in §22.2.3.
Teasing apart similarities due to genetic inheritance and those due to borrowings of varied
kinds is one of the hardest problems in comparative linguistics. As Dench (2001: 113–14) put
it, ‘it may not be possible to show conclusively for any particular innovation that it results from
genetic inheritance rather than that it is motivated by contact with another language. If enough
such cases occur, then the suspicion we might attach to any putative inherited innovation will
mount and we should become increasingly sceptical of any suggested genetic classiﬁcations.’
In Dench’s words, ‘we should leave open the possibility that all questions may turn out to be
undecidable’. We will now turn to the putative connections between Manambu and Kwoma.","[623, 624]"
"22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English61322.4.3 Functions of code-switches and borrowings
When children and teenagers speak among themselves, they use hardly any Manambu. Some
use Manambu to talk to their parents, and some to talk to their grandparents. In actual fact,
however, a lot of parent–child communication involves Tok Pisin, or even English. Typical
examples include 21.22 and 17.26b. Similar examples are 22.26–8. In these cases, the most
topical NP is in Tok Pisin—this goes together with Tok Pisin used as a way of getting the child
to do things. Tok Pisin inserts are in italics both in Manambu and in the English translations:
22.26 nem bilong yu aw

‘You might ﬁnish oﬀ granny’s water!’ (a warning not to drink too much)
All these examples involve commands. This takes us to a major function of Tok Pisin, as a
language of authority. This is also known as ‘directive’ function.
Consider the following interaction. The mother was getting more and more annoyed with
the little girl trying to pull bits oﬀ the stringbag the mother was knitting. She starts telling her
oﬀ in Manambu (22.29a), and then switches to a mixture of English and Tok Pisin (22.29b):
this makes the threat real and immediate.

And the threat was fulﬁlled, too: the mother hit the girl, the girl cried, and the mother
soothed her saying—in Tok Pisin—sori, mi sori. The incident was over. An alternative would
have been for the child to run away; and this was indeed her reaction to her mother’s shouting
the following:

‘It is this one, I will kill you, beware I might break your legs and hands’
The ﬁrst clause is an interesting example of the verb kiya- ‘die’ used transitively meaning
‘make die, kill’. I was told that this usage is not quite grammatical.
This kind of language socialization is strongly reminiscent of the situation in Gapun village
analysed by Kulick (1987). In both cases, code-switching and language mixing varies depending
on speech genre, and has a special illocutionary force. We will see in §22.6.1 that the sheer61422 Genetic and Areal Relationshipsnumber of Tok Pisin inserts may be indicative of the fact that language shift from Manambu
to Tok Pisin and English is imminent.
English is also in the process of becoming an even stronger ‘power-talk’, especially for
those for whom Tok Pisin is the major language anyway. A group of young boys gathered
around Yuakalu’s house were obviously up to no good. Yuamali went up to them to enquire
about their intentions, and addressed them as ‘Hello boys, what are you doing here?’ The
boys muttered something unintelligible and disappeared. Using English was Yuamali’s way
of asserting her authority over the wayward youngsters. This is very similar to the ways in
which the majority languages—be it Spanish, or Portuguese, or English—are used throughout
the world by minority speakers to claim power over others (see discussion, and references, in
Aikhenvald 2002a: 187–211 and Hill and Hill 1986: 364–86). The motivation for this is fairly
straightforward: speakers of the majority language are the ones in the position of authority,
and so those who speak minority languages employ these same languages to acquire the air of
authority; this may happen consciously, or not.
Children also code-switch when they talk to adults. A girl was trying to tell a story, and
forgot the name of the main character. In the question addressed to her mother, the possessor
(and the topic) was referred to in Tok Pisin. This agrees with the pattern illustrated in 22.26–8
above—the central, topical constituent, appears in Tok Pisin:
22.31 ta:kw-al
l@-k@

‘There is a woman, her village name is Maimwi, there is a man . . . Mummy, what’s the
village name of this man?’
But, more often than not, a child would spontaneously address an adult in Tok Pisin. One
girl (11 years of age), herself a highly sophisticated speaker of Manambu, was told to get her
mother’s towel (22.32a), using the Tok Pisin word taul. Her spontaneous reaction was 22.32b;
the mother answered 22.32c (note the English loan beg rather than the Tok Pisin bek):
Mother:

‘This here (next to you) is in the bag’
The trigger for the code-switch in this case could be the fact that the mother herself used
a Tok Pisin word (see Clyne 1987, on potential triggers for code-switching). This type of
interaction is highly frequent—and there is always enough Tok Pisin around to provide a
trigger.","[639, 640, 641]"

One often hears these demonstratives in conversations where diﬀerent directions are useful
for disambiguating classiﬁcatory relatives in the same relationship to the speaker. For instance,
if I am sitting in a house in a company of classiﬁcatory sisters, I may well refer to one as k@-l-aki
ñamus (dem.prox-fem.sg-across.away younger.sibling) ‘this younger sister sitting across from
me’, and to the other as k@-l-a-wula ñamus (dem.prox-fem.sg-lk-inland younger.sibling) ‘this
younger sister sitting closer to the part of the house further away from the Sepik River than me’.
The ‘close to speaker’ and the distal demonstratives are often used anaphorically, exactly as
in (ii) under A1 above. In 10.37, Katalu announced that the story he was about to tell was to
deal with the previously mentioned place up the river:

‘Today this is it, the story about that (area) up the river’
We have seen that speciﬁcations of additional distance and of direction are not compatible
within one demonstrative. As a result, two demonstratives often occur together in one NP—
one specifying the direction, and the other additional distance. The surface order is always
that illustrated in 10.38: direction ﬁrst, distance second. No other constituents can intervene
between the two demonstratives.

‘I will tell a story (focused) about how those far away ancestors from upriver, fathers,

This is the only technique available for combining information about additional distance
and direction in one NP.
B. The ‘current relevance’ demonstratives distinguish either (i) two degrees of distance
(B1), or (ii) ﬁve directions (B1). A ‘current relevance’ demonstrative refers to an object which
is being talked about, or is known or important to the speakers. It tends to be mentioned just
prior to referring to it with a demonstrative; but more often than not it is part of information
shared by the speech act participants.
B1. The ‘current relevance’ demonstratives distinguishing additional distance are in
Table 10.3.
The ‘far from both speaker and addressee’ ‘current relevance’ demonstrative distinguishes
a further degree of distance—‘very distal’. In contrast to the spatio-temporal demonstratives
discussed in A, the proximate k@- does not have this distance speciﬁcation.
The morpheme -ay has diﬀerent meanings with spatio-temporal and with ‘current relevance’
demonstratives. With the former it has a meaning of ‘further from speaker; or hearer; or both’
(depending on the choice of the stem). With ‘current relevance’ demonstratives it is like a10.2 Demonstratives211Table 10.3 ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives distinguishing additional distance

-na-awi ‘very far indeed’a- ‘distal’-ay ‘far from speaker and hearer’
-na-awi ‘very far indeed’‘placeholder’ which obligatorily accompanies the marker -na- ‘current relevance’. It is in a
paradigmatic opposition with -awi ‘very far indeed (from both speaker and hearer)’, but only
for the stems k@- and a-. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives often have a locational meaning;
but can also be used as prehead modiﬁers, e.g. k@-na-y k@-l-ay ñan (dem.prox-curr.rel-dist
dem.prox-fem.sg-dist child) ‘this mentioned further away female child’, and also 10.40. A
‘current relevance’ demonstrative can occur with time words: a-na-y nabi (dem.dist-curr.reldist year) means ‘that (past) year we are/were talking about’, and k@-na-y nabi (dem.proxcurr.rel-dist year) refers to ‘this (present) year we are/were talking about’.
‘Current relevance’ demonstratives are semantically complex. The ‘current relevance’ marker
-na- shows that it has been previously mentioned, or talked about, or that it is something the
speaker has in mind. And a demonstrative stem indicates the position of the object with respect
to the speaker or the hearer or both. The ‘relevant’ referent may occur in the previous stretch
of discourse, as in line ﬁve of T3.43: a-na-y (dem.dist-curr.rel-dist) ‘that mentioned’ refers
to the place visited by the character where he claims to have killed all the snakes. The place was
overtly mentioned two clauses earlier.
Or the demonstrative may refer to an object or a place interlocutors can both see at the same
time, and/or have just been talking about, as in 10.39. The ﬁreplace is closer to the speaker than
to the addressee.

Spatio-temporal demonstratives and ‘current relevance’ demonstratives can occur together
in one NP, as in 10.40, and always in this order: a current relevance demonstrative with
no gender or number speciﬁcation occurs ﬁrst and a spatio-temporal one comes next. The
two complement each other, since the ‘current relevance’ demonstrative here does not convey
information about the gender of the noun or the additional distance.

same location—in 10.41 it is the sky. The fact that the moon’s location appears to be close
to us and has just been talked about is reﬂected in the use of k@-na-y ‘this/here-previously
mentioned’. The fact that it is up there in the large (and hence ‘masculine’) sky far away is
reﬂected in the use of a-d-a-wur ‘that masculine up there’.

Or a ‘current relevance’ demonstrative can be added to a spatial demonstrative, to make sure
the addressee realizes that the object pointed at is the one under discussion. Example 10.28 was
rephrased as 10.42:
10.42 l@-k@

you we have been talking about’
B2. The ‘current relevance’ demonstratives distinguishing direction are in Table 10.4
These are used similarly to spatial demonstratives distinguishing direction. Example 10.43
is Gemaj’s answer to the question whether there is moonlight outside (so as to help me
decide whether to take a torch with me or not). The question was: bap-a-ta:kw t@ba:m t@na? (moon-lk-woman sky+lk+loc have/be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘is the lady moon in the

A location or an object referred to with the ‘current relevance’ demonstrative may not be
overtly mentioned at all—it is enough for it to be in the focus of people’s attention. A mother
used to say 10.44 to her baby daughter to stop her from going into a corner of the house where
the food was stored (located downriver with respect to the Sepik River’s course), believing that
the girl should be scared of imaginary mice:

‘Current relevance’ demonstratives are subtly diﬀerent from anaphoric demonstratives.
Anaphoric demonstratives provide a relationship between a pronoun and ‘another element, in
the same or in an earlier sentence, that supplies its referent’ (Matthews 1997: 18), and ‘are used
for reference to something earlier . . . in discourse’. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives state that
the referent is within the discourse (being mentioned, or talked about), or within the frame of
attention of the participants in a situation. Their scope is thus broader than simple anaphora,
though the analogy between the two is striking.
C. Directional distinctions in nominal demonstratives and in verbs (see Tables 10.5 and
16.1) share a number of similarities, but are rather diﬀerent. (In the majority of cases, verbal
directional markers do not attach directly to the verbal root: they appear on a dummy root
s@-.)
Directional markers on verbs and on demonstratives distinguish directions upward (marked
somewhat diﬀerently), downward, across, outwards, and inwards (all marked similarly). In
addition, directionals with verbs also distinguish motion towards the speaker (absent from
demonstratives), and two types of motion sideways. These diﬀerences can be accounted for by
the fact that directionals on verbs are inherently associated with motion, while with demonstratives they refer to location in space.
While directionals on demonstratives always have spatial reference, those on verbs can
be extended metaphorically and acquire idiosyncratic meaning, e.g. ‘talk-across away from
speaker’ means ‘to tell a traditional story’, and ‘die-across away from speaker’ means ‘half-die,
almost die’. This is discussed in §16.1. In that same section we look at how directional markers
can be used, or avoided, on verbs, and on demonstratives, within one clause.","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240]"
"22610 Closed ClassesThe combination agwa ja:p is very frequent. In informal discourse, the noun ja:p ‘thing’ can
be used in the meaning of ‘what’, e.g. ja:p-al? (thing-3fem.sgnom) ‘what is it?’ as a synonym of
agwa ja:p-al? (what thing-3fem.sgnom) ‘what is it?’ The form agwa- can modify other nouns,
e.g. agwa kudi ‘what language?’, agwa ma:j ‘what talk/stories are there, what’s the gossip?’ It
can co-occur with adjectival modiﬁers, e.g. agwa kwasa-kwasa-di ma:j bla-dana-di? (what smallsmall-pl story talk-3plsubj.vt-3plbas.vt) ‘what little stories are they telling?’ In 10.86, agwa
modiﬁes a non-agreeing adjective ‘good’ used as head of predicate. Of all interrogatives, only
agwa can occur in exclamations, as exempliﬁed in 10.86.
10.86 agwa vyak@t-al
what good/beautiful-3fem.sgnom
‘What a beautiful (woman) it is!’
The form agwa- can be used as head only in non-core functions—that is, marked with
dative (agwa:k) meaning ‘why, what for’, as in 10.87, with locative (agwa:m) meaning ‘in what
location?’, with instrumental (agwar) meaning ‘with what; how’, and with comitative (agwawa)
meaning ‘with what’, as in 10.88.
Agwa:k is very similar in meaning to agwa jap@k (in 10.85); the diﬀerence is that the latter
presupposes a longer statement of reason or purpose, and may imply a material object as a
reason, while the former is more abstract and is often used in rhetorical questions:
atawa wa-ñ@na-d@wun-@k
10.87 a

‘Then why did you say thus to me?!’
10.88 agwawa
k@-k@r
what+com eat-des
‘What am I to eat (sago) with?’
Similarly to nominal demonstratives, agwa takes the accusative-locative case only in the
locative meaning. Unlike any other word class, the allative-instrumental case with agwa has
only instrumental meaning. Note that there is a special interrogative word with an allative
meaning, akr@l ‘where to’ (see (iv) ).
(iii) The pronoun ak@- ‘where, belonging to where’ is used as a modiﬁer to a noun whose
location is being questioned, and as predicate head. If it is used as a modiﬁer, the noun is
either the subject of a verbless clause, a temporal or a locative oblique, or the possessor.
The pronoun always takes gender and number agreement. Its feminine singular agreement
forms vary depending on whether it is used as head or as a modiﬁer. The masculine singular
agreement is, as expected, -d@, the dual is -b@r , and the plural is -di. This pronoun is only used
with third person reference.

ak@ (in 10.89, 10.91)10.4 Interrogatives227This pronoun refers to the location of a participant in space, as in T1.20: a man has come to
ﬁght the moon but cannot ﬁnd her. Ak@- can be extended to have a temporal sense: ak@ s@k@r
(where.fem.sg time) is the only way of saying ‘when’, as in 10.89.
s@k@r ap
yi-b@r?
10.89 ak@
where.fem.sg time bone go/get-3dubas.vt
‘When did they two grow up’ (lit. ‘get bone’)
In 10.90, the masculine singular interrogative ak@-d@ is used to refer to a bamboo, in an
elliptical sentence. The bamboo is masculine because it is long:

‘My father told me about that bamboo up (i.e. told me to fetch it). Bamboo which is
where?’
In 10.91, this interrogative refers to a possessor (here, a locality). This is the preferred way
of asking where a person is from:
tami-k@-l
ta:kw-a?
10.91 ak@
where.fem.sg area-poss-fem.sg woman-3fem.sgnom
‘What (lit. where) area’s woman (is she)?’
The form ak@- can take one transportative case, -say, as in 7.64. If the question focuses on
the location, and not on the participant in a location, the locative or the terminative case form
is used, as in 10.92:
kur-ñ@na-di
10.92 a-di
kway ak@m
dem.dist-pl shrimp where+loc get-2fem.sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
‘Where did you get those shrimp?’
Either terminative or locative case can be used in asking about the source, as in 7.29, 7.55,
and 10.93:
t@-l@-k]
10.93 oh, vyak@t-a ta:kw, [ak@m
oh good-lk woman where+loc be/stand-3fem.sg-compl.ds

bring-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Oh, (what) a beautiful woman, where did you bring her from?’ (lit. ‘while she was staying
where, did you bring her from?’)
When focused, ak@- behaves similarly to reactivated topic demonstratives used as predicate
heads: the ak@- form takes a linking marker followed by -aka (glossed here as focus marker).
Unlike reactivated topic demonstratives, the marker is -m- (not n) for all forms, except ak@m
(where+loc) which does not take any marker (cf. -n- in aka-n-aka in 10.70). Focused forms
of interrogatives—unlike those for reactivated topic demonstratives—are not used as predicate
heads. Forms marked with the transportative -say and with the terminative -Vb do not occur
in the focus position at all.
As is always the case with focused constituents, focused locative interrogatives appear clauseinitially. In 10.94, a masculine singular form of ak@- is a modiﬁer in contrastive focus. As is
typical for a focused element, it is in the clause-initial position. The implication of the rhetorical
question in 10.94 is that there is no territory belonging to the cassowary’s son.","[252, 253, 254]"
"19
Other Dependent Clauses and Further
Features of Clause Linking
We will now discuss clause-linking devices other than clause chaining via medial dependent
clauses (see Aikhenvald forthcoming g, on their semantics). These include: juxtaposition of a
dependent clause and a main clause (§19.1); relative clauses (§19.2); clause linking via a case
marker ‘instead’ and a suﬃx ‘like’ (§19.3); purposive and desiderative clauses (§19.4); speech
reports (§19.5); clause linking involving connectives (§19.6); and juxtaposition of main clauses
(§19.7).
Manambu does not have complement clauses as a type on their own. Some types of medial
dependent clauses, juxtaposed clauses, purposives, desideratives, speech reports, and nominalizations can be used as complementation strategies—see §19.8. Dependent clauses can be used
as main clauses. This phenomenon, known as desubordination, is addressed in §19.9, together
with grammaticalization and reinterpretation of ‘medial’ verbal forms.
Table 19.1 features a comparison of dependent medial clauses, juxtaposed dependent clauses,
relative clauses, and main clauses in terms of their constituent order, predicate head possibilities, and tense, aspect, and moods expressed. Relative clauses are more similar to juxtaposed
clauses than to clauses of the other two types.
A constituent in a medial completive clause can be questioned, as in 10.80 and 9.33. This is
a special property of these clauses which sets them apart from all other dependent clause types,
especially relative and conditional clauses (see §10.4).19.1 j u xta p o s i t i o n o f a de p e n d e n t c laus e a n d a m a i n c laus e
Juxtaposed clauses are a type of dependent clause with no segmental marking. Juxtaposed
clauses are preposed to a main clause. They mark absolute tense (unlike medial dependent
clauses whose tense is relative to that of the main clause). All aspect and tense distinctions
of main clauses can be expressed. Similarly to dependent clauses in general, and unlike main
clauses, juxtaposed clauses are negated with the subordinate negator -ma:r-. Uninﬂected aspectual and modal forms require a support verb to be able to be used in juxtaposed clauses.
A striking feature of juxtaposed clauses is their rising intonation contour with the pitch
going up on the last syllable of the predicate. This intonation contour may be the only
feature that distinguishes positive juxtaposed dependent clauses from juxtaposed main clauses
discussed at §19.7. Juxtaposed clauses are strictly verb ﬁnal.
Juxtaposed clauses often express condition. Examples with a positive clause expressing
counterfactual condition via irrealis marking are at 13.35–6 and 14.55–7 (also see §13.3 and
§14.3.1 on irrealis in positive and in negative clauses). Examples expressing real condition are
14.58, 14.123–4, and 18.12. As shown in 14.56, whether the condition is counterfactual or not
may depend on the context, given the inherent ambiguity between irrealis and future. Example
19.1 may have either of three meanings: ‘if I had gone, I would have told you (the secret)’,Table 19.1 Main clauses versus dependent clauses: some distinguishing features

context, the second reading was the most appropriate: the speaker had not yet gone, was not
sure if she was going, and telling the secret depended on her going to another village and
learning the details:

That is, a real-condition reading is appropriate in 19.1. This is in contrast to -ga:y ‘unlikely
condition’ (§18.8) which always has a conditional reading. Similar examples are at T3.23 and
T3.25.
Alternatively, a juxtaposed clause may have a purely temporal meaning. An example is at
19.2: we know that it is not conditional because of the context of the story: the man is bound
to hit the road to go back home. This example shows that a juxtaposed clause can be postposed
to the main clause, just like most other dependent clauses.

A similar example is in the ﬁrst clause of T3.43. Here, the juxtaposed clause cannot possibly
have a conditional reading.
A juxtaposed clause does not have to be contiguous with the main clause: in 19.3 a cotemporaneous clause intervenes between a juxtaposed clause and a main clause. This same example
shows that a juxtaposed dependent clause can itself contain a medial clause. The ‘relative tense’
of the medial clause is determined by the absolute tense of the juxtaposed clause.

Juxtaposed clauses are similar to main clauses in most ways, except negation. No such
clauses have been documented in related languages. This clause type may constitute a recent
innovation.19.2 r e lat i v e c lau s e s
Relative clauses (see Table 19.1) involve an inﬂected verb—see §19.2.1. An alternative relativization strategy is verb-noun compounding—see §19.2.2. The two are compared in §19.2.3.","[492, 493, 494, 495]"
"The complementary distribution of v and p was described in §2.1.1. The root vowel æ is
unstressed. The vowel æ changes to ø in the directional suﬃx and in the bound form if the vowel
does not bear the primary stress. An example is yak`@ -saprà-daná (throw-across.to.speaker3plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘they throw (it) across towards the speaker’. If the vowel of the
directional bears the primary stress its realization is a, as in a-yak@-sapár (impv-throwacross.to.speaker) ‘throw across to speaker!’
The directional -aki ‘across away from speaker’ is clearly related to the inherently directional
verb væki- ‘go across away from speaker’. The component v- could have arisen by analogy with
the initial consonant of væra- ‘go across towards speaker’. There are no known cognates within
the Ndu family, so this remains speculation.
The directional -aku ‘outward’ is related to the inherently directional verb waku- ‘go out’. As
with -aki and væki-, the component w- in waku could have arisen by analogy with wula- ‘enter’.
The latter has cognates throughout the Ndu family (e.g. Wosera/Ambulas wula ‘enter’), while
waku- does not.
An intriguing pattern emerges from the comparison of the four directionals involving movement towards and away from speaker: this is shown in Table 16.3.
A brief comparison of the forms in Table 16.3 shows that the directionals with the meaning
‘away (from speaker)’ do not share the initial consonant with the corresponding verb, while the
ones with the meaning ‘towards speaker’ and ‘inside, away and inland from the Sepik River,
inside’ do. The initial consonant is the same for the two pairs—v/p for ‘across’ and w- for ‘away
from the Sepik River’ versus ‘outwards, away from land’. The two pairs look similar to echo
compounds (see §9.3).
The directional -u which occurs as a directional suﬃx with k@tu ‘(look) upwards’ and in bound
directional forms does not have a corresponding verb. (A hypothesis that -u may be related to
war- ‘go up’ is somewhat tentative.)
The complex directional bound form -saki-sala- ‘to and fro; across away-across towards’
does not have an equivalent verb, or a directional suﬃx. The component -sala- (see §16.1.4) is

(throw-across.away-across.towards-seq) ‘throw to and fro’, a-yak@-saki-saw´@l (impv-throwacross.away-across.towards) ‘throw to and fro!’, yak@-saw@lá-n (throw-inside-seq) ‘throw
inside’, a-yak@-saw@l (impv-throw-inside) ‘throw inside!’ The two are etymologically related;
but exactly how remains an open question. The directional bound form -solo ‘inside’ in West
Wosera (Wendel 1993: 62) could be related to either form in Manambu.
The intrinsically directional verbs are fairly generic in their meanings. Each of these
roots has cognates throughout the Ndu family. It is thus likely that the four verbs in Table 16.2
display an archaic pattern whereby the directional markers attach directly to the root as suﬃxes.
The directionals in other Ndu languages tend to have the s- formative (see note 3). Two of the
four intrinsically directional verbs have additional directional distinctions not found anywhere
else. The verb k@ta- in its fully reduplicated form k@táy k@tí means ‘around; round and round’.
This reduplication pattern is reminiscent of the irregular reduplication pattern found with the
word say ‘boy house’: say-si ‘each boy house’. In both k@táy k@tí and say-si, reduplication
involves repeating all the syllables of the form after its main occurrence, with the vowel of the
last syllable lost and y changed to i (also see §9.2).
k@táy → k@táy k@t-y → k@táy k@tí
say → say-s-y → say-si
An alternative explanation could go along the lines of a partial reduplication involving y
insertion, as in pay-p@s@n (red-go.round+seq) ‘go round and round’—this was discussed in
§12.8.2.
Another possible analysis of k@táy k@tí involves deriving it from a sequence of k@ta-, the
suppletive combining form of ‘look’, and -tay ‘sideways away from speaker’ (with subsequent
haplology of two identical syllables -ta-, following A6 in §2.6). All these possibilities are equally
plausible: whichever way we look at it, the partial reduplication in k@táy k@tí is somewhat
irregular.
The verb ‘bring, carry’ distinguishes two extra forms: kray- ‘bring from or take to a nearby
place’ and karya- ‘bring from or take to a faraway place’. It is possible that these forms consist
of the root kar-/kra- and a generic motion verb, either yi- ‘go’ or ya- ‘come’. The question is,
which one of the two? At the moment, we cannot decide.
Another unsolved problem is the vowel a in the imperative and negative form of karya-:
a-karay ‘bring (from distance)!’ and ma: karay ‘did not/do(es) not bring (from distance)’
(compare a-kray ‘bring (from nearby place)’ and ma: kray ‘did not/doe(es) not bring (from
nearby place)’). In addition, the two verbs kray- and karya- form a compound kray-karya‘carry to and fro’ (illustrated in 15.61). 1
This compound is quite unusual from the Manambu perspective: we can recall that in
compounding involving ‘go’ and ‘come’, ‘go’ precedes and ‘come’ follows, as in the ‘go-come’
construction discussed in §15.3. And we will see, in §16.1.3, that the directional away from
the speaker precedes the one towards the speaker in sequences of directionals, as in -sakisalan (across.away-across.inwards) ‘to and fro’. The origin of the pair kray- and karya- remains
unknown. 2
1 The intrinsically directional verbs can occur with some bound directionals—the forms kra-su- (carry/bringup) ‘bring upwards’, kra-sada- (carry/bring-down) ‘carry or push downwards’, and kra-saki- (carry/bringacross.away.from.speaker) ‘carry/bring across away from speaker’ are judged as acceptable by some innovative
speakers but are hardly ever used. Traditional speakers frown at these. The same holds for v@-su- ‘look up’ and v@sada- ‘look down’. I suspect these are analogical innovations.
2 Ambulas (Kundama and Wilson 1987: 53, 58) employs yé ‘go’ and yaa ‘come’ in the formation of verbs ‘bring’,
kure yaa, and ‘take’, kure yé. Additional complex verbs are kérae kure yaa ‘bring’ and kérae kure yee ‘take’ (p. 53);38416 Directionals and Valency-Changing DevicesBound directional forms used with optionally directional verbs consist of a formative
s- followed by directional suﬃxes. This formative is most likely the generic verb s@- ‘do, make,
plant, put, move’ followed by a directional suﬃx. Phonologically, such compounds are only
slightly irregular: we have no explanation why the directional s@w@la- ‘inside’ has a @, and the
directional sada- ‘down’ has an a in the ﬁrst syllable.
This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that the verb s@- is one of the intrinsically
directional verbs—see Table 16.2. It takes either one or two directional suﬃxes—the most
uncontroversial instance is sada- ‘put down’, alternatively pronounced as s@da-; the other two
are s@w@la- or saula- ‘push inside’, and saku- ‘push outside’ (see further discussion in §16.1.2).
Considering bound directional forms as instances of verb compounding involving s@- has
an additional advantage. The verb s@- is transitive, and the bound directional forms have a
transitivizing eﬀect on the verb—see §16.1.3.
In addition, the verb s@- in the meaning ‘move’ can also take bound directional forms: s@sada- means ‘move down’, s@-su- ‘move up’, s@-saki- ‘move across away from speaker’, s@sapra- ‘move across towards speaker’, and s@-s@w@la- ‘move inside’. (And see 16.61–2, for
the adverbial use of s@-su (put/plant?-up) ‘a little bit upwards’.) This does not invalidate the
hypothesis that bound directionals derive from the verb s@-. However, this hypothesis cannot
be fully proved at this stage. 3
The directionals -tay ‘sideways away from speaker’ and -tæy ‘sideways towards speaker’ diﬀer
from the bound directionals in a variety of ways, including the following:
(i) they do not have corresponding verb(s);
(ii) they do not occur with intrinsically directional verbs;
(iii) they can be reduplicated (see 12.67 and 12.70); and
(iv) they do not contain the formative s- which appears in the directionals used with optional
directional verbs.
They are functionally diﬀerent from other directionals in that they never aﬀect the verb’s
valency. See Table 16.4 in §16.1.3 and the discussion there. Just like other directionals, they may
have idiomatic meanings with non-motion verbs, e.g. wuk@-tay- (think/hear-sideways.away)
‘miss, be longing for (someone)’.
Verb compounds with inherently directional verbs as V2 also have directional overtones:
they indicate that something was happening while moving in one of the six directions encoded
in inherently directional verbs, e.g. yak@-su- ‘throw upwards’, yak@-war- ‘throw and go up’;
yaku-saki- ‘wash (e.g. sago) with criss-cross movements’, yaku-væki- ‘wash and go across’. See
Table 16.5 in §16.1.3 below.
A comparison of directionals on verbs and on demonstratives shows a number of similarities
due to the same origins. Yet, the existing diﬀerences show that the two systems have most
likely arisen independently of each other as a result of polygrammaticalization of inherently
directional verbs, whereby the same set of morphemes grammaticalized in two independent
ways. See the discussion in §16.1.5.
the verb kéraa meaning ‘get, take; buy’ displays a vowel alternation with kérae which is reminiscent of kray-/karya-.
However, any further comparison is tenuous.
3 Directional markers documented for Wosera/Ambulas (Wilson 1980; Wendel 1993) bear some similarity to the
bound directionals in Manambu, and contain the formative s-, e.g. -sada ‘down’, -sage ‘towards’, sala ‘out’, sawula
‘inside’, -sawuré ‘up’ (Wilson 1980: 63). At least some of these are transparently related to verbs such as wula ‘enter’,
wuré ‘go up’, daa ‘go down’. Since Wosera/Ambulas also has a generic verb sé with a basic meaning ‘make’, this may
also be an instance of grammaticalized verb compounding shared with Manambu. Iatmul also has bound directionals
with the formative s (Jendraschek forthcoming).","[409, 410, 411]"

It is possible that the negator ata used to be able to occur with diﬀerent-subject purposive.
Such examples appear in Harrison’s (1983) collection of archaic songs about foiled marriages,
e.g. ata can also be used, apparently, without an implication of another participant (song 8,
p. 48): 1

The negator ata is homophonous with the interrogative ata ‘how’ (§10.4) and the manner
demonstrative ata ‘thus, then’ (§10.2.2). We saw in §10.4 that the manner demonstrative and
the manner interrogatives are likely to be related. But is the negator ata related to these, and if
we assume that it is, how can a negative and a manner/interrogative meaning be connected to
each other?
On the surface, the negative meaning and usage of ata appear to be pretty independent from
the interrogative and manner use of the same form, and its derivatives, such as atawa ‘thus’,
ata ata, at@ta ‘how’. However, a certain amount of evidence in favour of a link between these
lies in the ways in which interrogative clauses are used with a negative meaning. Examples are
10.104 (ma:j at@ta wuk@-k (talk how hear-purp.ss) ‘How (am I to) hear the story (if children
are screaming)’ meaning ‘I am not going to hear the story’), and 14.73:

We will see in §14.6 below that questions are often used in lieu of negative statements and
commands. We can hypothesize that ata developed a meaning of negative intention out of its
interrogative use. No Ndu language appears to have an interrogative or a negator of this shape,
or function.","[340, 341]"

The general noun ma:gw has a number of functions. It occurs at the beginning, or in the middle,
of a clause if a speaker is searching for a right way to start, or to continue, their discourse. An
example is at 21.41: the speaker announces that she is going to tell a story, and then hesitates as
to exactly how to start it. The form ma:gw is used as a mark of such hesitation. It is underlined
throughout this section.

In this function, ma:gw is separated by a pause from the rest of the clause, and is never
case marked. Alternatively, ma:gw can be used as an argument within a clause, or as the head
of a verbless clause in the function of a placeholder for any noun (except for a noun with a
human referent) if the speaker cannot remember the exact term. During our trip to Swakap, I
asked Dameliway for a name of a fungus on a tree trunk. She immediately answered ma:gw-ad
