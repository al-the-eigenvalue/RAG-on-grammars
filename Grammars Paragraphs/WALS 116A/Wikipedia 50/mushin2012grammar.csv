(22.3.00.1.DMcD)10.2.3 Yu/miku ‘affirmation and negation’
Affirmation and negation/contradiction are done using the particles yu ‘yes’ and
miku ‘neg’, respectively. As (10.22) illustrates, the affirmative marker yu is mostly
uttered with repetition (i.e., yu yu). It rarely occurs as an affirmative response to
most polar questions, but this could be a result of the lack of clear polar questions
overall in the corpus.¹¹⁰ Yu yu does frequently occur as a response to confirmation checks, which may be considered a type of polar question. For example, in
(10.22), which is from an extended narrative, KS reports that the story characters
were left “over there”. DG proffers a candidate place name for where the characters were left (Kabularrku), and this is affirmed by KS with yu yu.

"Discourse particles marking stance317In (10.22), the place name introduces new (i.e., previously unmentioned) information, and, therefore, functions like a polar question. But yu yu can be used
to confirm information that is not new. For example, in (10.23), which is from a
conversation, KS asserts that some children they are watching are off to fly kites.
DG responds with the newsmaker-type response token ngarrikuna (§10.2.1 above),
which functions here to seek confirmation of this assertion from KS. KS confirms
this with yu yu.

‘Really?’The negative marker miku is also used to negate whole propositions and to negate
or contradict as a single word (§9.5.1 for general negation). Overall, the responseparticle uses of miku constitute a small fraction of its overall use as a marker of
negation. In (10.24), it is a negative response to a polar question (marked with
rising intonation but no questioning morphosyntax). In (10.25), it is used as a
disconfirming response to a confirmation check.

The particle yuku ‘all right’ is used in a range of contexts concerned with positive

‘It’s stuck down there (in my chest) like that food comes up in

that things are well. In (10.27), which is from a narrative, yuku is a marker of positive assessment to characterize the distribution of clean clothes as a good thing.
This was originally translated by the speaker as ‘We were happy (to have clean
clothes)’.","[334, 335, 336]"
"Information packaging and the marking of prominence303In (10.4), the speaker constructs a dialogue (a question/answer sequence), followed by the continuation of her exposition. The question asks for the direction
to which the group will travel the next day. As expected, the information that
corresponds to the question’s direct answer is in core-initial position (i.e., kula
‘south’ as an answer to yangka ‘which way’). While kula bears some features of
prosodic prominence (it is relatively high and intense by virtue of being the first
item in the intonation unit), it is the final word nganbi-nyi ‘lilyroot-dat’ that bears
the primary pitch accent for this utterance because it is longer and slightly higher
and louder. While this information was not directly part of the question, it is providing further new information that is of principle concern to the group – the
purpose of the expedition is not just to go south, but also to collect food such as
nganbi. Indeed, nganbi is repeated as the first word in the next utterance after a
gap of over five seconds, and followed by the clausal core. Here, nganbi is also the
most prosodically marked word, and, although it is no longer new information,
it links the return to exposition back to the information in the constructed quote.
This one example is given to illustrate how prosody and word order may work
together to facilitate the flow of information in discourse.","[320, 321]"
"9.5.1 Negation
Garrwa has many negative constructions formed using the negative particle
miku in initial position.⁹⁴ This particle is also used as the negative exclamative
‘no’ (e.g., in negative answers to polar questions). In clausal negation, the negative particle is followed by second-position clitic elements. This is typically a
pronoun, but some modal clitics are also possible, as discussed below. The verb
usually directly follows the second-position clitic complex. Where there are no
second-position clitics (e.g., when the referent is third person singular and therefore unmarked), the verb may directly follow the negative particle. Otherwise the
verb typically directly follows the second-position clitics.
In negative non-past contexts, verbs occur in the irrealis form (with -kanyi

retained in the negative reading because the meaning relates to social obligations. For example, in (9.110) below, the speaker claims that the protagonists were
not obliged to bury the dead person (because of social convention). Instead, they
hung him up in a tree.

When miku does not precede a pronoun, its scope narrows to negate the constituent immediately following it.

A negative existential predicate construction is formed using miku plus the
clitic =yaji as a nominal predicate. Speakers translate miku=yaji as ‘nothing’. Its
complement is a dative marked nominal or pronoun in such constructions. The
subject is typically unexpressed and interpreted as impersonal, which (9.114) and
(9.115) illustrate. Dative pronouns may indicate the person/number category of
the referent affected by the absence. This is illustrated in (9.115) and (9.116), where284Syntaxa negative possession interpretation is also possible. Most examples in the corpus
have a past time interpretation because they tend to occur in reminiscences of the
past. There is no overt tense marking in these examples.

‘There was no meat for us two down at the camp / We two had no meat

Yaji can also refer to general ‘things’ and places, which (9.119) and (9.120) illustrate. It seems plausible that the negation of such a general concept as a place/
thing could grammaticalize into a negative existential term as it appears to have
done here (i.e., no place = does not exist in space).

‘And you all keep watching my things.’ (3.9.04.4.DG)In some emphatic contexts, miku=yaji may occur with a the third person singular
nominal nyulu. This is common in clauses that start with the contrastive particle
ngala, which (9.121) illustrates. In these examples, miku=yaji is not in initial position because the sentence begins with the contrastive conjunction ngala, which
attracts a second-position pronoun. This ordering pattern relegates miku=yaji to
post-pronominal (post-core) position, which is the usual place for verbal predicates when they are not in canonical-initial position.
Note that the construction retains an impersonal reading even when there
is a third person singular pronoun, which examples (9.121) and (9.122) illustrate.

Almost all questions in the corpus are information questions. As noted above,
these kinds of utterances must begin with either wanya ‘what/who’, wanjawa

other clitics, and the verb in that order.

By far the most common use of question words in Garrwa is to ask questions.
It is common among Australian languages for interrogative forms to also have
indefinite, non-question related meanings (e.g., a form meaning who that can
also mean someone, I don’t know who) (Mushin 1995). It seems that, for Garrwa,
this indefinite reading is rare, certainly in main clauses. There are, however, some
examples from the corpus in which a question word appears embedded. It is
unclear whether the so-called embedded use of question words is associated with
an indefinite reading, or whether these are directly represented embedded questions and the question is simply shifted to the relative time of the main clause.⁹⁵
Example (9.128) illustrates this because the question follows a matrix clause of
direct speech (yanyba ngaki ‘she said to me’), and the deixis in the embedded
clause clearly shifts to the reported speaker (wanjawa nganyi mani ‘where is your
hand?’ rather than ‘where is my hand?’).","[298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304]"

tagNgarri also occurs as a response token: a single-word response with rising intonation (the same intonation contour as when ngarri occurs utterance finally). While
there are too few tokens in the corpus to formulate a detailed analysis, the translation of ngarri as ‘indeed’ or ‘really’, together with its positioning after new information (e.g., new episodes of a story), suggests that it can mark the recipiency
of new information (i.e., a newsmarker). The examples of ngarri in (10.12) came
while DG listened to a story being told by KS. DG responds to some new events
(but not all) in the story with ngarri. Following the second ngarri in this (edited)
extract, KS elaborates on the progression of the aboriginal prisoners’ journey and
validates this with an eyewitness – KS’s father. While, in general, it does not seem
that ngarri connotes a lack of belief (i.e., it does not mean something like ‘really,
I don’t believe it’), the fact that an evidential strategy is used immediately following the use of ngarri reinforces the analysis that ngarri is a newsmarker that
signals new information that must be integrated.

the questioning nature of the utterance, as least insofar as it projects a yes/no
response. In this example, DG’s use of ngarri kuna does result in a ‘yes’ response
from KS, which is not the case in the ngarri examples given above.

‘Bring her to Robinson River!’ (modal marking only in second
position)The positioning of basic grammatical information in second position, such as
person, number, and grammatical relations of core arguments, as well as tense,
aspect, and modal information, is an areal feature of north-central Australia
that includes Garrwa and some languages to its south and west (Mushin 2005c;
Mushin 2006). For example, similar structures are found in some NgumpinYapa (e.g., Warlpiri and Gurindji), Tangkic (e.g., Ganggaliida), and Mirndi (e.g.,
Wambaya) languages. Waanyi pronouns appear to behave similarly to Garrwa,
but Waanyi does not have tense or aspect marking in this position as Garrwa does.
The Garrwa second-position system differs from others in the region because it a)
lacks an auxiliary or catalyst element (cf. Warlpiri and Gurindji), b) lacks a clear
distinction between free and bound pronoun paradigms (cf. all other Australian
languages with second-position clitics), and c) shows variation in the placement
of pronouns and tense, aspect, and modal markers (cf. Warlpiri and Wambaya
where the order is fixed). Further properties of the Garrwa second-position clitics
are discussed in §5.7 (second person pronouns), §8.1 (tense, aspect, and modal
clitics), and §9.3 (syntax).
As shown in the examples above, the verb is the default word class that occurs
in the initial position that precedes the second-position clitic complex. However,
as discussed in detail in Chapter 9, if there is a motivation for marking a word as
prominent (or focused), then that word is found in immediate initial position and
the verb occurs immediately after the second-position complex. This is illustrated
in (3.7) with a question-and-answer pair from a narrative text. The question word
occurs initially in the question, while the information that answers the question
is also found in initial position.

The clitic =wali, here glossed as ‘evid’, is the only clearly epistemic modal morpheme in Garrwa. It is used in contexts where the speaker infers some future
event on the basis of (usually visual) sensory evidence in the present. As a consequence, =wali expresses that it is possible that something might happen on
the available evidence, but leaves open the possibility that it might not happen.
As there are only a few examples of =wali in the corpus, it is unclear how its
use relates to degrees of certainty. Speakers typically translate =wali-marked
clauses with ‘might’. In most cases, the actual evidence used is not made explicit,

It occurs in second position, a position more associated with clitics than with
particles. It may be that this form is loosely cliticized to the initial constituent. It
always occurs before second-position pronouns when there are pronouns in the
clause. Kuna is used in some yes/no interrogatives to indicate that the utterance
is a question.

Unlike clitics, particles may occur as independent words and in a wider range

this section have a range of modifying functions. Particles associated with clause
combining are described in §8.3 below. Some particles associated with discourse
organisation are described in §10.2.","[248, 249, 250, 251, 252]"

This chapter is mostly concerned with the linear ordering of elements in Garrwa
utterances, with some discussion of the basis on which larger constituents may
be defined.⁸¹9.1 Nominal groups
The term group indicates a set of nominal forms that refer to the same referent
and that share the same grammatical and semantic role. I use the term nominal
groups rather than noun phrases, although the groups in question do exhibit
some phrase-like behaviour. Members of a nominal group may occur in a prosodic unit, but they may also occur across intonation boundaries. While members
of a nominal group frequently occur contiguously (as one might expect of noun
phrases), they may also be discontinuous. The main discourse function of
nominal groups is to identify referents.","[271, 272, 273]"

‘But they came, like this, all the old men, possibly.’ (3.9.03.1.KS)9.4.2 Pragmatically determined non-canonical orders
There are several identifiable contexts in which words other than those canonically found in initial position (i.e., verbs and other words that are grammatically
found in core-initial position) occur in initial position. Nouns are by far the most
frequent type of word in this position, followed by temporal adverbs. Some conjunctions (e.g., baki) may precede them, just as some conjunctions may precede
verbs. In such contexts, the initial word precedes a pronoun, and the verb follows
the pronoun so that the pronoun retains its second-position status. In third
person singular contexts, there is no pronoun and the verb immediately follows
the initial word.
The contexts in which this latter word order occurs include situations where
the word in question is pragmatically prominent. This prominence usually occurs
because the speaker has some motivation for making such a word stand out
from the rest of the words in the utterance. These include contexts that are often
called “focus” (e.g., Lambrecht 1994; Vallduví and Vilkuna 1998; É Kiss 1998) in
the linguistics literature – information that is at variance with assumed hearer
expectations. Such contexts might include where a word answers a question or
fills a knowledge gap (what Lambrecht (1994) calls “narrow focus”). In storytelling, this initial position is used for newly introduced referents who are significant
for the plot (e.g., because they will become ongoing characters in the story, or
because they refer to plot-changing information – see Mushin (2005a) for more on
the narrative functions of initial position). In both of these contexts, the relevant
information may be new to the discourse (and possibly new to the hearer), but
newness alone is not the determining factor. As Mushin (2005a) demonstrates for
narrative, new information that has no plot significance does not occur initially.","[291, 292]"

eZIn summary, across a range of contexts and pronoun types, =yi clearly prefers
to attach to second-position pronouns when there is one present. There are,
however, a considerable number of clauses where =yi is attached to the verb even
when there is a pronoun present (as the examples above show). There are also
examples of =yi attached to verbs even when the verb is not in its canonical-initial
position. Mushin (2008) suggests that this is evidence of a shift towards =yi as a
verbal inflection, rather than =yi as part of a second-position clitic complex. In
the question/answer pair in example (8.11), the question word is initial (as it must
be) and followed by the second-position pronoun, which is then followed by the
verb with the =yi clitic attached. In theory, however, the =yi could attach to the
second-position pronoun, similar to many other examples.

west-loc
‘I got bait over in the west place.’ (27.3.00.1)8.1.1.2 =(Y)ili ‘habitual’
The habitual clitic =(y)ili is almost always used for a habitual meaning in the past
– ‘used to do X’ – or a durative or iterative meaning in the past – ‘kept doing X’.
Its focus is on the aspectual features of durativity and repetition of the activity or
events in question when they were being undertaken. In my data, the allomorph
=yili attaches to anything other than a pronoun, while =ili attaches to pronouns.
The attachment patterns of =yili are considerably more varied than both =yi ‘past’
and =ngka ‘present’.
The difference between =(y)ili’s habitual and iterative meanings seems to
depend on the time scale of the event or activity being expressed. A habitual
meaning concerns activities that take place over an indefinite period of timeClitics209(although no longer in the present), and is the default TA clitic for talking about
the way Garrwa people lived in the old days. Examples (8.12) and (8.13) illustrate
this meaning.

‘They (working men) would go and put up fences. While I would be at
the camp, staying and cooking food. I used to cook food. I used to make
clothes.’ (28.3.00.3.TD)The clitic =yili takes on a past durative or iterative meaning when the timeframe
of the event or activity is more restricted. For example, in narratives, a =yilimarked clause indicates that the action in question occurs repeatedly for some
duration during narrative time, but that it is bound by subsequent events in the
narrative. For example, in both (8.14) and (8.15), the protagonists are staring at
other character in the story. In (8.14), the protagonist stares at an apparition of
the storyteller’s father. In (8.15), the protagonist is staring at a woman with sexual
intent. In both cases, =yili is used to mark the durativity of the staring – that
these characters are watching beyond a stretch of time normally associated with
this activity. However, following this particular episode, the story moves to other
events that occur after this staring event.","[225, 226, 227]"

Winjawa is used exclusively for questioning location and direction. There is no
associated morphology, not even locative and directional case marking (cf. directionals in §6.2.1 and §6.2.2 above). It is not clear what differentiates winjawa from48 Note that, in this example, the plural and locative question word is followed by a third person plural locative pronoun. This may be because the question is asking for a subset of people
from a larger (known) set (i.e., ‘which ones of them?’).","[162, 163]"
"40Grammatical overview3.2.3.1 Pronouns
Pronouns (Chapter 5) form a distinct category in Garrwa based on their restricted
syntax and class-specific case morphology. Like nouns, pronouns inflect for core
grammatical relations (nominative and accusative), oblique (dative), and locational and directional cases. Pronominal categories are like those found in many
other Australian languages: there are forms for first, second, and third person
singular, dual, and plural; first person non-singular pronouns distinguish inclusive and exclusive categories. Additionally, there is no third person singular accusative form and third person singular nominative forms are rarely used. Morphology is regular, except for first and second person singular forms, which exhibit
some suppletion.
A distinctive property of Garrwa pronouns is the formation of compounds,
which include accusative + nominative pronouns (§5.4). These are used for transitive constructions that only involve human referents. Example (3.10) compares
some pronoun forms.

‘second person singular accusative/ first person singular

‘first person singular accusative/ second person singular

‘third person plural accusative/ third person plural nominative’Pronouns almost always occur in second position in the clausal core, where
they are often cliticized to the core-initial word. This is illustrated in (3.6). As §3.1
notes, Garrwa is like many languages of north-central Australia (e.g., Warlpiri,
Gurindji, and Wambaya) because it has second-position pronouns. Most of these
languages have an additional set of free pronouns that pattern with nominals
in their distribution. What distinguishes Garrwa in this respect is the lack of a
formal distinction between second-position pronouns and free pronouns. That is,
the same pronominal forms found in second-position clitic complexes may also
occur utterance initially; for example, in cases of prominence (see 3.11, which
is from a conversation), where a third person plural nominative pronoun occurs
initially as the answer to a question.","[57, 58]"

(extracts)
Conversation recorded on video and audio between Doreen George, Kathleen
Shadforth and Hazel Godfrey on 20th June 2008 at the Robinson River school
office. Ilana Mushin was not present for most of the recording time.
The camera and audio equipment was set up and left running for about
25 minutes, during which time I absented myself. The camera was set up to focus
on the three Garrwa women who were seated around a table. Sections of the
recording where other people enter the office have been edited from this transcription. Thus, the conversation gives a sense of how people talk about ordinary things. This conversation has been selected from the larger corpus of Garrwa
conversations because of the high proportion of Garrwa spoken, relative to Kriol
or English. Even here, however, speakers use code-switching between these languages.
The entire conversation was transcribed by myself in collaboration with the
speakers who were recorded and Rod Gardner between 2008 and 2010. The first
line of transcription of this conversation follows the conventions of Conversation
Analysis (Atkinson and Heritage 1984) as follows:

are no clear deictic cues in the embedded clause. The future marker in (9.130)
might suggest a future relative to the past time in the main clause (future in the
past). This would apply whether the embedded question is a more direct representation of the pilot questioning what he might see (‘…where will he see that
body?’), or whether it is truly an indirect report of what the pilot said (‘…where he
will/might see that body.’).

‘It (the airplane) was flying around this way, looking for it, where it

telling another character (who has been arrested) to give an account of a fight for
which he has been arrested. The use of past tense in the embedded clause supports an analysis here of a truly embedded clause whose deictic configuration is
relative to that in the main clause. The embedded clause has the structure of a
question, but it is difficult to see how this could be interpreted as a direct question (? ‘You should tell that white man how did you fight each other?’).","[304, 305]"
"Non-canonical word orders275Other common interactive contexts where non-canonical initial elements are
found include when a speaker contrasts with or contradicts something someone
else has said – cases of what I call here managing misalignments. It is also used
for rhetorical emphasis, often with a repetition of the word at the end of the utterance. This of course does not exhaust the possible contexts in which a Garrwa
speaker might use such non-canonical word order. The aim here is to give a sense
of the kinds of contexts where such orders tend to be used.

In conversational repair sequences (i.e., dealing with problems of hearing and
understanding, or disagreements about information, information being presented as the crux of the problem occurs in initial position.
In (9.83), the participants are discussing the location of a Salvation Army representative who has been visiting the community. KS claims to have seen him
arriving because she was at the school before him early that morning. The first
person pronoun ngayu is initial here as KS emphasizes her witnessing of him
coming to the school. DG counters with an assertion that he arrived yesterday
(i.e., not today) and has the word for ‘yesterday’, wulani, in initial position to
contrast KS’s assertion that he was seen today.","[292, 293, 294]"
"102 There are many aspects of Garrwa discourse that I do not include in this grammar, but
which would ideally be relevant to a chapter on discourse-related phenomena. These include a
detailed analysis of the discourse functions of prosody, and the ways in which Garrwa speakers
organize utterances into larger structures, such as conversational sequences. Some work on
Garrwa conversation has been published elsewhere (e.g., Gardner and Mushin 2007; Mushin
and Gardner 2009, 2011; Gardner 2010).
103 The linguistics literature is rife with terms that refer to different kinds of information
status, and it is beyond the scope of a descriptive grammar provide a full review. These clearlyInformation packaging and the marking of prominence30110.1.1 Prosody and word order
Like most languages, prominence in Garrwa is perhaps most saliently and iconicallymarked through prosody. Prominent information tends to be more stressed,
louder, and at the boundaries of intonation units, including in its own intonation unit.¹⁰⁴ Prominence is also signalled by word order. The information packaging properties of word order are described in detail in §9.4. To summarize that
section, information that is an answer to an information question and construed
as contrastive or highly emphatic is found in the initial position of the core of
Garrwa clauses, which (10.1) and (10.2) illustrate.

her grandfather if they are staying in their current location overnight. Her grandfather answers to the contrary, and the direct speech introduction clause (which
is not speech itself) is marked with ngala. Note that the ngala-marked clause here
takes tense marking (yanyba=yi), perhaps to reinforce the deictic shift from one
speech event in the narrative to another.

(15.5.01.1.DG)8.3.4 Jala ‘relative’
Like ngala, jala relates events and situations in terms of their temporal organization. Clauses marked by an initial jala indicate that the event or situation occurred
or is occurring within the same time period as the event or situation denoted in
the first clause (‘X occurred while/when Y occurred’). Unlike ngala, however,
there is no implication of contrast between the events in question. Rather, the250Clitics and particlessecond clause is interpreted as relative in time (and sometimes space) to the first
clause.⁷⁹
Jala shares syntactic properties with both baki and mada in some respects
and ngala in others. Jala is like baki and ngala because they almost exclusively
occur utterance and clause initially. Like baki and mada, but unlike ngala, jalamarked clauses have their own tense/aspect marking, which is usually directly
marked on the particle (cf. Ngala clauses, which do not have tense/aspect
marking). Like baki, jala can directly take the =yili habitual clitic (which (8.200)
illustrates). Unlike baki, however, there is the distinct past-tense form jali (which
may be jala=yi) that (8.198) and (8.199) illustrate. Like ngala, but unlike baki and
mada, a pronoun usually directly follows jala if there is a pronoun in the clause.
This makes jala look like an initial element in the clausal core (like ngala), but
one that can take its own tense/aspect marking. There are no examples in the
corpus of modal clitics attaching to jala.

(20.6.08.DG)Some clauses with jala are used to modify a proposition or referent in the previous clause to say something about the kind of place or time it is. This is similar to
how some relative clauses are used in English. In (8.200), which is from a conversation, the speaker says she will go “south” (i.e., to Alice Springs), a place where
she will be fed bush tucker. The jala-marked clause thus says something more
about the south place.","[266, 267, 268]"
"Interrogative words1436.3 Interrogative words
There are three root forms for asking information questions: wanya ‘what/who’,
winjawa ‘where’, and yangka ‘which way’. These always occur clause initially and
attract second-position clitics, including pronouns. While they share functional
and syntactic properties, only wanya takes case marking, which is consistent
with its function as a marker of unknown nominals. The other two forms take no
extra morphology.","[160, 161]"
"6.3.1 Wanya ‘what/who’
This form is used to question both things and people (i.e., potential referents).
Whether the questioned referent is a person or a thing is inferred from the context.
There is some variation between the citation form wanya and the form wanyi in
conversational contexts. Wanya is the most common nominative (unmarked
form). Wanyi- is the stem form used when wanya is case inflected, but it sometimes occurs in nominative contexts (which (6.117) illustrates).

that the grammar does not treat it as a pronoun. Additionally, wanya inflects like a
nominal and takes ergative rather than accusative marking (as (6.123) illustrates),
as well as other oblique case marking. The allomorphs of the case markers are the
same forms as those attached to demonstratives. Like most Australian languages,
dative marking results in the English translation ‘why?’ (‘what for?’)

‘You should go.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)Very occasionally, speakers use the different clitic =i for marking directives. This

used more frequently in Eastern Garrwa. It only occurs attached to verbs and
replaces its final vowel.

‘Throw the hat like this, old woman.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)8.1.2.2 =Kiya ‘obligation’
The obligation clitic =kiya is used in a range of contexts associated with speakers’ stance towards the content of an utterance. This includes content either a)
desired by the speaker but not accomplished by the addressee, or b) intended by
the speaker or referent but understood to be socially proscribed or undesirable.
Unlike the directive clitic =kiyi (described above), =kiya occurs with all person/
number categories and in past and non-past contexts. Unlike =kiyi, it implies
no illocutionary force through directing an addressee to carry out an action, but
rather focuses on the action in question as one that is bound by social relations.
I use the term obligation for this clitic because this term evokes social relationships and restrictions, explicit or implied. This is consistent with the clitic’s
deontic modal functions. Because there are a relatively small number of tokens
of this form in the corpus, it is difficult to develop a more detailed account of the
notion of obligation. As such, the nature of the obligation may not be explicit in
the data. It emerges most strongly in second person past-tense contexts where
the implication is that the addressee should have done something but did not.
Examples (8.115) and (8.116) illustrate this.

with =kiya by expressing a self-motivated action (i.e., the thing desired) that is
not able to be carried out. In (8.117), which is from a traditional narrative, the
speaking character expresses a desire to eat, a euphemism for having sex. The
person he desires is one who is not an appropriate sexual partner, however.⁷⁶

(8.118) actually happen in their respective stories.","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248]"

"8.2.1 Ngawamba ‘only, just’
This particle restricts what is under its scope to that and only that. Ngawamba
precedes that which it has scope over. It frequently occurs clause or utterance
initially where it may attract TA clitics (which (8.140) illustrates) and secondposition pronouns. It can have scope over a nominal (which (8.141) ilustrates) or
an entire clause (which (8.142) illustrates). It is not clear how such scope relations
are established formally. In (8.141), it is clear from the contexts that the scope of
ngawamba is over the nominal (i.e., only the auntie was taken, not other people)
and not over the whole clause (i.e., *only took the auntie, not did other things),235Modifying particleseven though the verb is what immediately follows the particle and the nominal is

"6 Demonstratives, directionals,
and interrogatives
This chapter mostly describes forms whose primary function is to pick out entities
and locations in space: demonstrative, direction, and location words, words used
to ask information questions, and constructions associated with temporal reference. Many of the forms described in this chapter share some features with nouns
but differ enough in their inflectional possibilities and in their distribution in sentences for them to be classified as a different word class from nouns. Like nouns,
however, demonstratives form part of the system of reference, and can combine
with nouns in nominal groups (see §9.1). Therefore, they share inflectional features with nouns. Location and direction words generally function as adjuncts in
clauses to signal aspects of spatial orientation. Their inflectional properties are
restricted to grammatical meanings associated with spatial orientation, and they
pattern quite differently from nouns. Demonstratives, directionals, and interrogatives each form a small closed class based on their distinct morphosyntactic
behaviour. There are also a number of location words and temporal words that
pattern more like particles.","[131, 132]"

‘We didn’t used to eat beef.’ (2.5.01.1.KS)The default second position slot for pronouns can be characterized as the place
where pronouns are found when they are being used to signal the person,
number, or role features of the referent in question when there is no particular
focus on these features. This could be because the referent is well established in
the discourse or in the situational contexts, or because other information in the
clause is being highlighted in some way.
When the discourse or situational context does motivate the pronoun’s highlighting, it occurs in initial position. Initial pronouns only occur in contexts of
emphasis or contrast. In such cases, they are intonationally set off from the rest
of the clause. For example, in (5.113), the initial pronoun yalu occurs prior to the
normally initial conjunction jali. In this part of the conversation, KS contrasts
what she and others were doing (i.e., putting paperbark on a wagon) with what
her cousins (and perhaps others) were doing (i.e., getting bark off the tree).

This particle/clitic is used in a range of ways, all of which indicate an intensification of that which is under its scope. Speakers frequently translate it as ‘more’,
although it does not seem to have the same range of meanings as the English
“more”. For events, it can mean that the event is done repeatedly. Mili is mostly
found in second position and so may be loosely cliticized to the preceding word
as other second-position phenomena are. In the second position, mili appears to
occur after all other possible clitics (TA and pronouns). In (10.30), it occurs after
the TAM clitic =(y)ili; in (10.31), it occurs after both the TA clitic and the following
accusative pronoun; in (10.32) and (10.33), it directly follows the pronoun.

This chapter focuses on word order, particles and their contribution to discourse
organization in Garrwa. Some features of turn management in conversation,
such as overlapping talk and the use of silence, are examined in other work (e.g.,
Gardner and Mushin 2007; Mushin and Gardner 2009; Mushin and Gardner 2010).
The range of particles examined here show much that is common across Australian languages and languages in general, but also much that may be unique to
Garrwa. For example, while the prior information particle barri shares features
with a related particle in Yanyuwa, they are clearly not synonymous. As noted in
the introduction to this chapter, any analysis of discourse phenomena is incomplete without a proper understanding of the use of prosody. Such as study must
be left for future work, however.","[336, 337, 338, 339, 340]"
"7.5.1 -Ji ‘purpose’
Complex clauses marked with –ji ‘purp’ mean ‘do X in order to do Y’. In intransitive clauses, the subject of the subordinate clause must be co-referent with the
subject of the main clause, and is only mentioned in the main clause. In transitive
clauses, the object may also be co-referential.

Like the purposive construction, subordinate clauses marked with -jiwa ‘subsequent’ must share a co-referential subject with the main clause, and they must
denote an event that takes place subsequent to the event in the main clause (‘X
until Y happens’). That is, the event denoted in the subordinate clause marks a
subsequent or concluding action that was brought about by the event denoted in
the main clause. For example, in (7.134), the eating of food is a subsequent action
predicated on the subject first getting up. Similarly, in (7.135), the cooking of the
goanna is framed as the subsequent action which is dependent on the killing
of the goanna in the first instance. In (7.136), the projected recording session is
framed as a subsequent event to the linguist’s return (she was absent at the time
this was uttered).

(8.5.01.1.KS)In all of these examples, -jiwa is used in a context where event X is clearly presented as a precursor or prerequisite to event Y (‘X until Y’). Analysing -jiwa as aVerb inflectional morphology193signal of the endpoint of a sequence of events is, however, also compatible with
a purposive reading. As an endpoint, the second event can be read as the intentional consequence of performing the first event (‘do X in order to Y’). This is the
meaning attributed to -jiwa in Furby and Furby (1977). The suffix -jiwa differs from
-ji in that it does not require the agent of the events to have a conscious intention
(‘Y as a consequence of X’, ‘X leading up to Y’). The following examples appear to
incorporate a (weak) purposive meaning, which indicates the close relationship
between -ji and -jiwa.

‘They used to bring the milk from up (there) and/to boil it.’ (28.3.00.1.KS)Forms that focus on events as endpoints may additionally be analysed as resultative constructions (‘Y as a result of X’). Results are usually expressed as end
states, however. It is not clear from my current data whether the –jiwa marked
clause is viewed as a result.
Another difference between the purposive -ji and the subsequent -jiwa is the
ability for subordinate clauses with -jiwa to occur following the co-ordinating
conjunction baki ‘and’ (described in §9.6.1). The use of baki, which is the regular
conjoiner of temporally ordered clauses, raises the possibility that speakers do
not always treat -jiwa clauses as subordinate. It is not possible for clauses marked
with the other verb inflections to occur with conjunctions. -Jiwa may be special
because it has temporal ordering as part of its core meaning, and this is what may
be motivating its co-occurrence with baki.

The subordinate clauses formed with the irrealis suffix -kanyi must have the same
subject as the main clause. It is commonly used to form complements to verbs of
communication and cognition. It is also used in the formation of negative verbs.
When the main verb is a verb of speaking or cognition, the subordinate clause
represents the action being thought or spoken (e.g., ‘I told her to X’, ‘I thought
about X’) rather than the content of speech/thought as in indirect speech representation. The suffix -kanyi is glossed with irrealis because it always occurs in
contexts where the proposition of the subordinate clause is not realised, which is
usually because the proposition in question is a thought, desire, or words of the
subject of the main clause, and not a representation of the actualisation of the
proposition.

-kanyi occurring in contexts where the purposive clause denotes something done
habitually, or when attention is being drawn to the general utility of the object in
the main clause. It does not denote any particular instance of the event in question. In this sense, the subordinate clause appears to function as a modifier of the
object of the main clause. Examples (7.151) to (7.155) come from Furby and Furby
(1977), but I have re-translated the examples to better reflect the use of the irrealis
suffix to signal certain kinds of habitual behaviours.

The contexts in which these morphemes may be used is restricted to simultaneous actions, ones where the activity described in the switch-reference marked
clause must coincide in time with the event / activity in the main clause. Examples (7.156) to (7.159) illustrate this. In this sense, switch-reference marked clauses
are aspectually activities.
The suffix -jina marks co-reference between the subject of the main clause
and the subject of the subordinate clause (i.e., subject control), while -kurri marks
co-reference between the object of the main clause and the subject of the subordinate clause (i.e., object control).

KS)While there are clear temporal framing restrictions for the acceptability of switch
reference coding, there do not seem to be any general valency restrictions with
respect to switch reference marking. These clauses can be transitive or intransitive. Note that the subject of the transitive subordinate clause takes its case
marking from its role in the main clause. That is, it does not have the expected
ergative marking but rather absolutive marking as the object of the main clause.

(7.165) illustrate, switch reference contexts does not seem to be compatible with
reported speech contexts. That is, the content of speech does not count as a
simultaneous action. This is interesting because the content of perception does
count as a simultaneous action for the purposes of switch reference marking. One
explanation is that speech representation (whether direct or indirect) involves a
shift in perspective from the framing clause of speech to the content of speech.
Perception sentences do not involve a shift in perspective.
Note also that switch reference is not used when the content of speech
expresses some embedded illocutionary force, such as a command (-kanyi is used
in these contexts).

speech. In (7.166), the irrealis -kanyi is used, while in (7.167), the content of speech
is represented as direct speech with a deictic shift to future tense in the second
clause.

7.6.1 -Wa “still”
This aspect-like morpheme is used to indicate that the action denoted by the
verb is still going or continuing. Because this morpheme seems exclusive to verbs
(there is another homophonous morpheme -wa that attaches to directionals and
demonstratives to reinforce directionality – see §6.1.3.2) and not associated with
a position, I do not analyse this as a tense/aspect clitic. Semantically, it has more
in common with other aspectual clitics.","[209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217]"

‘But that boy would just sit there, looking at her.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)The different contexts in which ngala can be used are summarized below.
a) Temporal contexts
Ngala can indicate that one event involving one set of participants occurs at the
same time as another event involving a different set of participants. In these contexts it is usually translated as ‘while’. It is often used in narratives to contrast
what two different (sets of) characters are doing at the same narrative time. In
such clauses there is never any tense marking in the ngala-marked clause as it
inherits its temporal reading from the previous clause. Pronouns always occur
directly following ngala in these contexts.

(9.10.03.1.TD)Ngala can also establish the time that an event or situation occurred relative to
another situation while maintaining the same participant. It is often translated as
‘when’ in these circumstances, although ‘while’ may also be appropriate.

contr 3sgnom white.man-loc

waki-nyi

‘He saw them while he was working for the white man.’ (3.0.03.3.KS)b) Contrastive contexts
Ngala can also indicate that the event in question is in contrast with what has
already been said with no implications of relative temporal organisation. In such
cases, ngala is usually translated as ‘but’. In these cases, it is common for the
ngala-marked clause to maintain the word order of an independent clause. This
is the main formal difference between ngala clauses with a temporal implication
and ngala clauses without a temporal implication. It is perhaps iconic of the independence of the connected clauses.
In (8.192), which is from a narrative, the contrasted clause has verb+pronoun
order. In this example, there is a clear contrast between what the people in the
story did not do with a character’s corpse (i.e., bury it in the ground) and what
they did do with it (i.e., they hung it up in a tree).","[263, 264, 265]"

Inanimate A-arguments may also be coded with ergative case. These are frequently weather or climate related terms, which raises questions about the extent
to which such nouns are conceptualized as inanimate in such contexts. Examples
(4.50) to (4.52), in which the inanimate nouns are floodwater moving over other
objects and an airplane in motion (respectively), illustrate this.

Collectively told by Doreen George, Thelma Dixon and Kathleen Shadforth on 1st
May 2001 at Macarthur River Caravan Park. Also present: Ilana Mushin.
This text was elicited at the start of my 2001. I had arrived in Borroloola following a particularly wet March/April where part of the town was flooded. This
prompted memories of a previous large flood brought on by Cyclone Kathy in
1985. This is the flood mention as occurring when some of the speakers were in
Burketown (a town well to the east of Borroloola in Queensland).

‘He walked turning west along the river.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)The locative stem can also occur with the suffix -bana ‘side2’. Since -bana begins
with a stop consonant, the stem augment -n- also occurs, which results in the form
-nbana. While both -ya and -nbana are glossed as ‘side’, they differ in whether the
side in question is on a human scale (i.e., in relation to people or objects around
people) or whether it is on a geographic scale. For relation on a human scale, -ya
is used, while -nbana is used for a geographic scale. Conventionally, -nbana is
used to point to a bank of a river (e.g., the east/west bank of a river running north/
south, or a north/south bank of a river running east/west).

"7.2.3 Productivity of verb derivation
There are clearly some differences in the productivity of verb derivation according
to class. It seems easiest to derive new verbs in class 1, and it is unclear whether
it is possible to derive new class 2B verbs at all. There are many examples of
nominal roots in the corpus that form the basis for class 1 and 2 verbs. In all of
these examples, the class 1 form has a causative meaning, while the class 2 form
has a stative/inchoative meaning.

juji-j-ba ‘lie’
juja-mba ‘deceive’
kali-j-ba ‘flopped down
kala-mba ‘bend’
lirrki-j-ba ‘grow up’
lirrkamba ‘raise (child)’Some class 1 and class 2 verbs clearly share the same root and have the expected
meaning associated with their root. Despite this, there is often no independent
word, nominal, or otherwise that corresponds to these roots.
(7.68)*jarrijarri-j-ba ‘be absent’jarri-mba ‘take away’These examples further reinforce the analysis that -j is an inchoative stem and
that -mba is a causative stem, at least in derived verbs. There is little evidence that
these productive meanings apply to true verbs, however, which leaves open the
question of when the stem forms acquired these meanings. If they were originally
causative and inchoative stem forms, then we might expect some reflexes of these
meanings in the true verbs as well as the derived verbs. The fact that we do not
find clear reflexes suggests that the assignment of meanings to these conjugation
classes is a later, albeit well-entrenched, phenomenon.","[194, 195]"

Overall, the co-occurrence of pronouns and co-referential nouns is quite infrequent in discourse. This is largely due to the predominance of first and second
person pronouns, which have no noun equivalents. In third person contexts, nonsingular nominal referents usually co-occur with pronouns, while third person
singular referents rarely have both pronoun and noun in the same clause (reflexive/reciprocal pronouns are an exception). Where it is possible for a pronoun and
co-referential noun to co-occur, only one argument may do so. That is, it is only
possible for either the subject or the object to have such a double reference.
Where subjects are doubly marked, the nominal occurs on the periphery of
the utterance, and sometimes in a different prosodic unit. In the same prosodic
unit, doubly marked objects occur adjacently in the clause’s core (§9.3.1). This
raises questions about the syntactic status of such nominals, especially whether
they or the pronoun has argument status in the clause. Given that pronominal
subjects are far more common than any other kind of referring expression, it
seems likely that it is they, rather than the nominal, that represents the subject
argument of the clause. The argument status of object nouns and pronouns is less
clear when they co-occur. Obliques are clearly represented by either pronouns or
nouns, but not both.","[125, 126]"
"3.2.4 Particles and clitics
Garrwa particles are identified as forms that do not take any additional suffixes,
inflectional or otherwise. Forms of this type exhibit a range of grammatical functions that includes adverbial-like clausal modification (§8.2), location (§6.2.3),
clause combining (§8.3), negation (§9.5.1), and a range of functions associated
with discourse organization and talk-in-interaction (Chapter 10). Some particles
typically occur utterance initially (e.g., baki ‘and’ (§8.3.1)), some typically utterance finally (e.g., junu ‘perhaps’ (§8.2.5)), while others occur in second position
(e.g., kuna ‘question’ (§8.1.2.5)). Particles that occur in utterance-medial positions are usually weakly cliticized to the preceding word. I consistently represent
particles as independent words in this grammar in the interests of consistency.
Garrwa speakers treat them as independent words.
Garrwa clitics are always prosodically dependent on the preceding word, and
speakers do not typically treat them as independent words. Most clitics occur in
second position as part of the second-position clitic cluster within the core of the
Garrwa clause (§9.3.1). These include: tense and aspect markers (e.g., =yi ‘past’,
=yili ‘habitual’, =ngka ‘present’, and =ja= ‘future’ (§8.1.1)) and modal markers
(e.g., =kiyi ‘imperative (§8.1.2.1) and =wali ‘evidential’ (§8.1.2.4). Examples (3.16)
to (3.21) below illustrate these.

second-position clitic complex. As with particles, I consistently write them as
separate words, although it is clear that pronouns in the second position are
phonetically dependent on the preceding word in discourse. Modal clitics always
directly attach to the word in core-initial position. The examples above have tense
or aspect clitics attached to the second-position pronoun. However, as Mushin
(2008) and §8.1.1 of this book discuss, tense and aspect clitics can also directly
attach to the core-initial word and can precede the pronoun, which (3.22) illustrates with the past tense clitic =yi (=i when attached to pronouns).

Garrwa nouns are formally identified by morphological processes specifically
associated with this word class. Case marking is the most frequent and salient
morphology associated with nouns. Nouns form a large open class with many
subclasses (not all of which are themselves open-class categories). Noun subclasses are identified on the basis of their distribution, meaning, and case allomorphy. In this chapter, I describe the morphological and distributional properties of common and proper nouns, kin terms, and quantifying nouns. I describe
interrogative words, which mostly pattern with nouns, in Chapter 6.
Common nouns cover a large range of semantic types that includes words
referring to people, animate and inanimate natural objects, man-made objects,
and qualities of objects. Unlike many languages in this region, Garrwa has no
grammatical system of noun classification. There is also no verbal agreement or
obligatory pronominal cross-referencing. These are all common morphological
strategies among Australian languages for identifying referents and maintaining reference in discourse. In this context, Garrwa looks morphologically poor,
but Garrwa speakers have various strategies to establish and maintain reference,
such as choosing the referring expression (e.g., noun vs. pronoun vs. zero) and/
or the word order.","[60, 61, 62]"

"224Clitics and particlesd) Unlike the other three TA clitics, =ja= can occur utterance initially, but it must
be attached to a pronoun in this position. These are cases where the pronoun
occurs initially because it is in a context of prominence. It appears that the future
marker may remain preceding the pronoun in these contexts, even though it
would be grammatical to position the clitic following the pronoun (which examples (8.81) to (8.84) illustrate). In (8.91), the future marker is the first element of
the speaker’s turn in a conversation. In (8.92) to (8.94), the future marker is the
first element of a new intonation unit.

A common practice in discourse and especially in narration is to utter a lengthened vowel (usually /e/) over a constant pitch to represent the passing of time.
This vowel may be held for seconds and this, together with the sustained pitch,
gives the word a singing-like quality. Furby and Furby (1977) analyse this practice,
which is widespread in Australian Aboriginal discourse, as a durative morpheme.
I retain the gloss ‘durative’ for this practice, although it is unclear whether it
should be analysed as a morpheme. At the least, it is a regular means for speakers
to express the passing of time in speech.
I transcribe this practice as eee when it occurs utterance initially and as ==
(two equals signs) when it directly follows another word. Examples (8.97) and
(8.98) illustrate the use of this.

The set of clitics classified here as modal express something about a speaker’s
evaluation of an utterance. Three of these have a deontic modal meaning associated with obligation and which are either addressee oriented, speaker oriented,
or group oriented: the directive clitic =kiyi (speaker evaluates utterance as something the addressee is obliged to do); the obligation clitic =kiya (speaker evaluates utterance as something done or not done with approval or disapproval); and
the hortative clitic =nyi (speaker evaluates utterance as something a third party
should do). The fourth modal clitic =wali is epistemic, and the fifth clitic =kuna
frames an utterance as a polar question.
Modal clitics attach directly to initial constituents regardless of word class.
If there is a second-position pronoun, the clitic attaches to the initial constituent
prior to the pronoun.","[241, 242, 243, 244]"
"Number marking for human referents794.6.1 -Wuya ‘dual’
In (4.150), both the kinship noun kangku ‘FF’ and the qualifying noun minkin
‘skillful (one)’ take dual marking.

ngaki
kangku-wuya
skillful-du
1sgdat FF-du
‘Two great dancers, my two grandfathers (were).’ (28.8.03.1.ER)The word for ‘child’ is bayayawa. In dual and plural forms, baya functions as
the root morpheme. It is not clear what -yawa means. It does not occur in other
words. Note that, in (4.154), dual marking occurs in the presence of the 3dunom
pronoun bula.

‘There are two children up here standing at the ghost gum.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)The dual marker appears to be optional in the presence of the numeral kujarra
‘two’. In (4.155), the big referents, which happen to be animals, are marked with
the dual suffix in the presence of the numeral kujarra ‘two’, but, in (4.156), -wuya
is missing despite the presence of the numeral.

In (4.157), both the demonstrative and the qualifier nominal minkin ‘skilful’
are marked with the plural morpheme; however, the plurality of badibadi ‘old
woman’ is signalled by partial reduplication. In (4.158), however, the plurality of
badibadi is signalled with -muku (here, there are no other coreferential nominals80Nounsin the noun group). In this example, madamada ‘possum hair skirt’ is not overtly
marked as plural even though the plurality of ‘old women’ implies the plurality
of possum hair skirts. This reinforces the analysis that -muku only marks human
nominals.

Note the inclusion of the 3plnom pronoun yalu (cf. (4.154) above with the 3dunom
pronoun bula) in the following examples.

‘We also brought young boys from the south, child(ren), this big mob.’
(21.3.00.1.DmcD)When -muku attaches to a possessive pronoun, the meaning is ‘X’s mob’ (i.e., all
the people associated/related to X). Again, this reinforces the analysis of -muku
as a marker of numbers of humans only. Note again that, in (4.161), julaki ‘bird’ is
not signalled as plural even though it is clear the referent is plural from context.

This section summarizes the ways in which both alienable and inalienable possession is marked in Garrwa.
a) Possessors in alienable possessive constructions usually take dative case
marking. This is particularly the case when the possessed is a (more) permanent
fixture, such as one’s own stories, which (4.163) illustrates, or a house, which
(4.164) illustrates. As discussed in §4.2.3, kin relationships are also marked with
dative case.

‘I’m going to hang up my dress.’ (Mushin 2003 field notes)b) A temporarily possessed item (e.g., money) is marked two ways: with the associative -yudi ‘with’, or with the possessor taking locative rather than dative case.
When -yudi is used, the possessor is subject and the possessed is predicate, which
(4.167) and (4.168) illustrate. However, when the locative -na is used, the possessed is subject while the possessor is predicate, which (4.169) illustrates. It is
not clear what motivates the choice between these two constructions in discourse.

part shares the same case marking as the possessor. In (4.170), the possessor is
a nominative pronoun (intransitive subject of the sentence); in (4.171), the possessor is marked as an ergative nominal as the transitive subject of the sentence.
Self-propelled movement of a body part requires a reflexive subject, which (4.172)
and (4.173) illustrate.

Garrwa pronouns fall somewhere between the category of independent words
and bound clitics. There is one set of pronouns, represented in Table 9 below,
with reflexive and reciprocal pronouns derived from this set (§5.5). A subset of
pronouns are able to combine to form compound pronouns (§5.4). Pronouns
share many properties with nouns, which includes grammatical functions such
as core and oblique arguments, the capacity to refer, and anaphoric functions.
Like nouns, pronouns inflect for case to signal the role they play in clauses. Pronouns, however, have distinct case allomorphs from nouns (§5.2) and distinctive
syntactic properties (§5.6 and §5.7).
In isolation, these forms are phonological words and can occur independently (e.g., as one-word answers to questions). However, they are more often
found cliticized to a preceding word (i.e., prosodically dependent). The host
of the pronominal clitic is almost always the initial constituent in the clause.
These restrictions on pronoun placement, together with their loose phonological dependency, make Garrwa pronouns resemble both free pronouns and bound
pronouns. Pronoun placement is described in more detail in §5.7. Bound pronouns, in contrast with free pronouns, lack a distinctive paradigm, which makes
Garrwa typologically unusual among Australian languages.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102]"

is possessed. In (5.14) below, TD lists women who are known to be good dancers.
In the first possessive phrase, the possessive pronoun precedes the possessed
noun; in the second, the possessed noun precedes the possessive pronoun.

Pronouns in locative case are typically translated as ‘with X’ rather than ‘at X’,

people) implies that this person (or people) is engaged in social activities, not just
that they are located at some fixed point or area.

5.3.1 Trisyllabic and disyllabic forms of pronouns
Four of the non-singular pronouns alternate between a trisyllabic form (nimbala,
nungkala, ngambala, and ngaliya) and a disyllabic form that omits the final syllable.³⁰ These are the only pronouns to alternate in this way. For these four pronouns, their trisyllabic form is the form given in elicitation. It is the form always
used in contexts of prominence (e.g., contrast or emphasis), and follows the contrastive particle ngala (see §8.3.3) in utterance-initial position.

describing cultural practices. Example (8.66), which is from a text describing preparations for a ceremony, illustrates this. The speaker is describing how
women make skirts in general, rather than describing an actual skirt being made
at the time of speaking.

the clitic attaches to a verb or to a pronoun. The main variation in the use of =ja=
is whether it encliticizes to a prior word as other TA clitics do, or whether it pre-222Clitics and particlescedes the word to which it is attached as a proclitic. =Ja= is always an enclitic
when it attaches to a verb, but it may be either an enclitic or a proclitic when
attached to a pronoun, which examples (8.78) to (8.80) illustrate.⁷³
a) =Ja always occurs as an enclitic when it is attached to verbs with no pronoun
present.

noun(s). In cases where a datively marked pronoun is further marked with dative
as part of a possessed nominal group (e.g., phrases like ‘my mother’s axe’ and ‘my
father’s country’), the pronominal allomorph is -(n)kanyi, as it is for demonstratives and interrogatives. Dative pronouns that end in the suffix -ngi (the regular
pronoun form) are followed by -kanyi rather than –nkanyi. It is possible that this
allomorph is selected to avoid the doubling of nasal consonants (e.g., niya-ngkanyi ‘1duIncl-dat-dat’ in (4.77) compared with ngaki-nkanyi ‘1sgdat-dat’ in
(4.78)).

the associative suffix -yudi (§4.5.1), it raises the question of where the semantic
boundaries lie. Note that locative case is used in some contexts of association,
too. Example (4.81) demonstrates the close relationship between dative case and
the associative suffix -yudi because the speaker uses both morphemes to indicate
that the two story characters returned with a sugarbag (in their possession).
