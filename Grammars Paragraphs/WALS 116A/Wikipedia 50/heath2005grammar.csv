"3.3.1.1Suffixes and clitics inducing penultimateaccentAs noted above, some suffixes and clitics ending in a C are treated for
accentual purposes as though they had an additional syllable (a nonsyllabic
suffix counts as having one syllable, a monosyllabic suffix counts as having
two, etc.). At any rate, they require word accent on the (surface) penult instead3.3 Accent85of the antepenult. It is probably best to treat this as a morphophonological fact,
simply stipulating that the suffixes and clitics in question have this effect on
word accent. I use the double grave accent ν to indicate surface accent due to
the effect of these morphemes
Alternatively, one could argue for underlying representations of the
suffixes and clitics that have one more syllable than appears on the surface.
This could take the form of a final (or initial) unspecified vowel (V) that is
present when accentuation applies but is then dropped by a late, ad hoc
morphological rule.
Another alternative would be to recognize floating accents on the left of
the morphemes in question (the accent would attach to a syllable to the left). A
floating-accent analysis would be most appropriate when the suffix or clitic is
monosyllabic (contains one vowel), and the accent ends up on the immediately
preceding syllable. This analysis is less attractive for cases (FeSg -t, 3MaSg
-\t) where the suffix or clitic is nonsyllablic (consists of just consonants), so
the accent ends up on a nonadjacent syllable farther to the left.
The morphemes in question are those in (63).

"12.3InterrogativesYes-no (i.e. polar) interrogatives are simple sentences with an optional
question particle, or just with interrogative intonation.
WH-interrogatives are closely related to the focalization construction, but
usually omit the demonstrative following the focalized constituent.",[668]
"The rule does not apply to nominal morphology, where Fe prefix t- is
never deleted. In the rare cases (involving loanwords) where Fe t- directly
precedes a C-initial stem that lacks a vocalic prefix, Schwa-Epenthesis applies
and we get ta- (§3.2.5). In several dialects, though not in T-ka, the FePI prefix
combination t-i- reduces (by Prefix Reduction) to t - 0 - before a stem beginning
in CV..., e.g. PI t-l-kabr-en 'sparrows', but reduced form (in a PP) d a e r
^t-O-kabr-en 'in the sparrows'. In this combination, the t- is not deletable.
(T-ka reduces -i- to schwa here: daer ""t-a-kabr-en.)
Whether Prefixal t-Deletion also applies to the -t- prefix marking the long
imperfective stems in many verb classes is a tricky question. In those cases
where it appears audibly, this -t- is always followed by a V, so there is no
question of deletion. However, all cases (except one) where -t- is absent from a
long imperfective stem involve C-initial stems like LoImpfP -bdddasd- 'get
up' and causative -s-arad- 'wash'. Although I do not favor this analysis, one
might argue that -t- is underlyingly present here but is always deleted by
Prefixal t-Deletion.
The one case where -t- is (or rather may be) absent from a long
imperfective stem is in the class of verbs of basic shape -vPvC-. Here the
LoImpfP varies between -aPPaC- and -t-aPPaC-, e.g. -awwat- and -t-awwat'hit'. We therefore have only equivocal evidence as to whether -t- is part of all
long imperfective stems. The alternative analysis is that - t - is in
complementary distribution with F-c2 (i.e. gemination of C2); see §3.4.2.1.
In the type -aPPaC- varying with -t-aPPdC-, if a t- subject prefix is present
we always get e.g. phonetic ftaw:a't], which can be parsed morphologically as
either t-awwdt (with 3FeSg t-) or as 0-t-awwat from /t-t-awwat/.",[67]
"5.1.1.2ComparativesThe most common symmetrical comparative construction, glossable as 'X be
as [adjective] as Y \ involves the transitive verb -ujdvh- (PerfP -ojdaeh-). In
the absence of a specification, this verb can mean 'be equal to' or 'be as big
as'. It can be adapted to other adjectival qualities by adding an appropriate
specification ('X equals Y [with respect to\ strength'). The specifying noun
follows the verb, with no preposition. The Resit stem -ojdaeh- is usual in
positive comparatives. Some dialects have g for T-ka j.

"3.4.9.1Presuffixal α-Shortening(Non-AugmentVerbs)To begin with, non-augment V-Final verbs shorten a stem-final α to ae before
C-initial suffixes (but not clitics). This analysis is based on the assumption that
the stem-final V ' s in question (see §7.3.1.3, §7.3.1.5) would otherwise appear
as the full vowel a . The full set of C-initial suffixes that can follow an
inflectable verb stem are listed in (107).

"7.1.2Alternative segmentations of Augment -t-As with some other suffixes, there is some ambiguity as to the precise form of
the -t- augment. I segment it as -t- and assign the preceding as or a to the verb
stem. Certainly there is evidence that the stems in question end in a full V (it
appears overtly in the VblN, for example), so we need a V-Shortening rule that
applies to the V when it is followed by the augment. The closest parallel to this
is the shortening of a stem-final V (in unaugmented verbs) before C-initial
subject and Participial suffixes, e.g. PI Partpl -nen (§8.5.1). This analysis
allows us to take the final full V (i or u) that appears overtly in the VblN and
in the LoImpfP as lexical (except where a final u is attributable to spreading
from another medial u in the stem).
However, other segmentations of the augment are also possible.
Alternative #1 is to segment the augment as -vt- (v = short vowel), realized as
-aet- or -at-. This strategy would require application of VV-Contraction,
effectively deleting the stem-final full V before the short V of the suffix. This
would entail hyphenating 'burst.PerfP' as -abbuqq-ast (instead of my
-abbuqqae-t), and its Sg Imprt as büqq-at (instead of buqqa-t). To account for
the alternation of -set- and -at- in this analysis, one could simply include the
augment in the scope of the respective stem melodies. Alternatively, we could7.2 Stem categories299allow the melodies to apply to the pre-VV-Contraction stem, then have the
stem-final V's high or low feature transferred to the augment-initial V as part
of the VV-Contraction process. A similar transfer occurs in VV-Contraction
examples involving unaugmented V-final stems in the Shlmpf, which end in
the underspecified high vowel hi (§3.1.2.4, §7.3.1.3).
Alternative #2, which might be considered by readers who wish to
motivate the distinction between augmented and unaugmented V-final verbs
other than by lexical verb-class assignment, would be to take the augment as -t
as before, but to claim that verbs of the augment class end in underlying short
(not full) v. The difference between augment verbs and other V-final verbs
would then be predictable: augment verbs are simply those verbs ending in a
final short v. This would account directly for the surface ν in the augmented
forms ( a f f u r r a e - t , f u r r a - t , etc.). It would also permit a phonological
interpretation of the way VV-Contraction applies when the stem-final V is
directly followed by a V-initial subject suffix (-aer, -aed, -aem, -asn), see
(305.a), above. Specifically, we could posit /ae-as/ —> e in all of these
combinations. For unaugmented verbs, we would posit stem-final l a l in the
PerfP, so the VV-Contraction cases would have underlying l a - x l , which
surfaces as either ae or e depending on which suffixal category is involved
(§7.3.1.1).
Alternatives #1 and #2 each have some attractive features. I reject
alternative #1 since the VblN and other nominals show a clear stem-final full
V (with no Augment). I reject alternative #2 since there is no other evidence
for positing stem-final short V's (contrasting in phonological behavior both
with full V's and with deletable stem-final V's).","[317, 318]"

capture the full range of long imperfective shapes, and the long imperfectives
of heavy verbs are transparently constructed by applying ablaut components to
the basic form of the stem, preserving the stem's C and V positions. However,

7.2.4323Alternative 1PI hortative construction using Imprt stemIn the regular hortative construction with suffix P)-et just described, the full
set of entities exhorted or permitted to undertake the activity is indexed in the
grammatical subject. For example, if there is one speaker and one addressee,
'let's go!' has 1P1 subject.
In the alternative construction to which we now turn, a 1P1 dative clitic is
added to an imperative. The overt subject of the imperative is Sg or PI
depending on the number of persons in question, excluding the speaker. This
imperative verb is followed by a 1 PI dative clitic, even if only two persons
(speaker and addressee) are present. The 1P1 dative can therefore be taken as
subsuming the 2nd person subject of the imperative. In this construction, 'let's
go!' for two persons (1st dual inclusive) is expressed as 'go!-Sg for us'. On the
other hand, 'let's go!' for three or more persons is expressed as 'go!-Pl for us',
the imperative being 2MaPl or 2FePl according to the sex of the addressees
(and any other included non-speaker referent). Data in (327) are valid for at

verb #-vstvn-. 'Be respected' is the passive of - s - v m r v r - 'respect, honor', a
lexicalized causative of the adjectival verb 'be big' in the contextual sense 'be
important' (PerfP maeqqor-). 'Be reduced' is the passive of -s-vdrvs- 'reduce',
causative of the adjectival verb 'be few, not much' (PerfP darus). To the extent
that the double derivation is logically transparent, the passive-of-causative
appears to have the underlying patient as subject ('X be caused to be big/few'),
with both the agent of the intervening causative and the outer agent omitted.
'Be eaten' in (481.b) does not seem to differ much in meaning from
-amm-aksa-, the simple mediopassive on which it is based.
The usual variant forms occur for A-grm, in particular LoImpfP
-tiw-as-sstin- and -tiw-as-amrir- with no Lolmpf -t- prefix.","[488, 489, 490]"
"3.1.2.6Phonological status of medial [u] and [i] before CMost cases of medial [u] and [i] are unproblematically assigned to u and i
phonemes. However, there are some cases where I transcribe them as
diphthongs, ay or a w . The stems in question have ablaut alternations of the
type asw versus [u], or asy versus [i]. For example, the verb 'dust o f f has a
Shlmpf stem kaeykaey [kae'jkaej], and a PerfP stem [a'k:ikasj] that I transcribe
-akkaykasy-. Likewise Shlmpf laewlaew 'tower (above)' and PerfP [a'hulu],
the latter transcribed -allawlaw-.
For the irregular verb 'sit' (Vrym or Vrm), the most common forms are of
the perfective stem family, e.g. PerfP [-aeq:ima-] (for T-ka, the [ae] is a backed3.1 Segments41realization of /a/, harmonic to i, before a BLC, but for other dialects it is a true
initial ze). The Shlmpf is dialectally variable, e.g. Sg Imprt r a m (qam) versus
Yayam. This variation suggests competing analyses of the perfectives, as
either -aqqima- or -sqqayma- (plus variants with initial ae). The LoImpfP is
usually - t - a r a s y m a - but - t - a r a m a - is attested dialectally. See §7.3.2.9 for
more on 'sit', and on the other stem of the same type (Vjyh or Vjh 'witness').","[59, 60]"

'run'There is an asymmetry between the cases with e and those with ο in the

Mediopassive derivatives with -m-. Especially in the causatives, we often get
perfective ο even when the VblN and other forms point to lexical i. Leaving
the choice between e and ο aside, the question here is how to account for the
mid-height V's in the context of ablaut mechanics.
Synchronically, the most straightforward interpretation is that the midheight V's reflect a mix of Η and L features. The fact that the mid-height V is
flanked by two ae's in the trisyllabic perfectives suggests that a stem-wide <L>
melody is at hand. This would make sense if we assume a lexical high V.
In other contexts the melodic L or Η trumps lexical vocalic features. For
example, - b v l u l w - 'gape' with medial u has PerfP -aeblalaer-, which
preserves no trace of the rounding feature. By contrast, the perfectives in (97)
combine /u/ with L to give o, and HI with L to give e. In other words, the
surface mid-height V is a compromise, and rounding and backness values are
preserved.
For historical speculations see the end of the preceding section.
(98)V-Height Compromise
After reconfiguration (see below), middleweight verbs of the
shape -CuCvC-, and V-initial light verbs (e.g. -uCu-), whose first
V is a full high vowel {i u}, combine with an overlaid <L>
melody as j e o ) , respectively. In other words, they compromise
on vowel-height, while preserving the lexical rounding and
backness value.","[142, 143]"

although t-e-taete is the logical subject of 'occupy', the latter has default

In R dialect, ar is also a particle meaning 'until' or 'all the way to', but in
T-ka and other dialects the 'until' particle is har (§13.1.1.5).11.3.2 'other than'(ssel)
The particle sael occurs in a construction of the type '(an) X other than Y'
where X is a noun (normally indefinite in sense) and Y is an NP with more
specific reference. If X is not expressed by a regular noun, the minimal
demonstrative ά can be used, sael is not a preposition, and a following noun
does not undergo Prefix Reduction.

"3.1.2.4Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (in verbs)A number of verbs have stem-alternations involving full V's, short V's, and
zero. These are the only unaugmented V-final verbs. For example, 'vomit' has
a PerfP -absa-, with 3FePl subject absas-naet 'they-Fe vomited'; I take its basic
lexical form to be -vbsu-. The Shlmpf is -zebs (e.g. Sg Imprt aebs 'vomit!')
without the final V. The Shlmpf combines with 3FePl subject suffix -naet as
absa-naet, with a stem-final a that also induces an assimilatory (i.e. harmonic)
change of stem-initial /ae/ to a. It also combines with 3MaPl subject suffix -aen
to give sbsa-n. I take the basic (lexical) form of the Shlmpf to be /-aebsi-/,
ending in an underspecified high V ""i"" that is deleted without trace wordfinally (i.e. where no subject suffix appears). The hi contracts with the /ae/ of a383 Phonologyfollowing V-initial subject suffix to form 3, in effect transferring its [+high]
feature to the surviving short V. The hi surfaces as a before C-initial subject
suffixes like 3FeSg -naet.
A good case can be made for a parallel underspecified and deletable low V
that I write IAI. This occurs only in long imperfectives of a subset (namely,
bisyllablic -vCCu-) of the same V-final verbs that have h i in the short
imperfective (preceding paragraph). The LoImpfP in question appears as
- P d Q Q word-finally (i.e., with no subject suffix), as in -bass 'vomit'.
However, when a C-initial subject suffix is added, we get forms like 3FePl
bassas-nast with a stem-final low V, and this is the main evidence for a
representation of the type /-bdssA-/. When a subject suffix beginning in as is
added, we get forms like 3MaPl bdssae-n, which could be generated with or
without a stem-final /A/, but which I take (by parallelism to the short
imperfectives) as due to contraction, i.e. /bassA-asn/ with the IAI transferring
its [-high] feature to the surviving contracted V. In sum, the evidence for IAI is
weaker than that for hi, and IAI occurs in the paradigms of a subset of the
stems that have hi.
For more on these unaugmented V-final verbs see §7.3.1.3.
Both final hi and IAI in these verbs correspond to ""u"" in the corresponding
forms of Niger Tamajak (LTF2 424, class I.A.7-ll,e.g. Imprt ""zeknu"" and
LoImpfP ""ikannu"" for 'do well'). However, Foucauld's data do not have a
final V in such forms as ""iläss"" for 'he dresses' (DTF 4.2020) and ""ed iken""
for 'he will do well' (DTF 2.821).
Synchronically in Tamashek, one might equate stem-final hi with a, and
IAI with ae, noting that {a ae} do not otherwise occur as stem-final segments.
However, these equations are not transparent, and the fact that the verbs in
question have stem-final full V's in the perfective and long imperfective stems
makes it difficult to justify short-vowel representations for hi and IAI. No
other stems or words in the language end with short V's.
If we were to identify hi and IAJ with full V's (the only V's that otherwise
occur in stem-final position), hi should probably be identified with i rather
than with u. This is because there are some verb classes with a non-deleting
final u, either in the imperfective forms only or in both perfective and
imperfective stems. For example, the verb 'cough' appears as -asu- in both
PerfP and Shlmpf stems (§7.3.1.4). This u does not delete word-finally, and
contracts with /ae/ at the beginning of a subject suffix to form u rather than a,
as in asu-n 'they-Ma coughed' from /asu-aen/. This true stem-final u therefore
has no phonological similarity to III. However, there is only one verb with true
i in the Shlmprt stem, namely -Iwi- 'be born'. Since this verb has a /-iCi-/
shape not found with any of the verbs that I analyse as having final hi in the
Shlmpf (and IAI in the LoImpfP), one could imagine identifying III with i and
trying to connect the phonological differences in some way with stem shape.
However, again this is a somewhat convoluted argument, and I prefer to think
of hi and IAJ as abstract segments with vowel-like properties.
The deletion rule may be formulated as (29).","[56, 57]"
"12.2.5Focalization of verb or VPVerb (or VP) focalization occurs, for example, in response to questions of the
'what are you doing?' type. This corresponds to ""verb clefting"" in the syntax
literature. The verb (or VP) is converted into a VblN, is treated as the object of
-vji> 'do, make', and is then fronted like an ordinary focalized direct object. In
effect, -vju- takes the place of the verb in the original location. Focus
morpheme ά is usually present, but it is omitted in (752). Note that here the
complement ('suffering') remains in its original position, rather than following
the lexical verb into clause-initial focalized position. The complement cannot
be fronted along with the VblN unless it is expressed as a possessor NP, and
while this is grammatical, the construction in (752) with the complement
following -vju- is far more idiomatic and is common in texts. However, the
entire core VP, here 'see suffering', is logically focalized.",[666]
"The alternation between -vPPvC- and derived -üPvC- gives credence to
Prasse's view (MGT 6.69-70) that the verbs in question reconstruct as
*-vwPvC-, the semivowel sometimes fusing with Ρ to form geminated PP, and
sometimes fusing with the first ν to form u. In further support of this is the fact
that no #-vwPvC- verbs with surface w occur.
Prasse (MGT 6.72-3) also argues, less convincingly, that the -vPvC- type
(exemplified above by -vwvt- 'hit') reconstructs as *-vPhvC-. While this
would result in a certain analytical unification, whereby all three types
reconstruct as *-vPQvC-, I see no evidence (direct or indirect) for the putative
*h. Synchronically this analysis is challenged by verbs like -vdhvl- 'help'.
The three verb types are quite common. A few further examples (cited in
the Imprt) follow. For the -vPQvC- type: abdad 'stand', ablaj 'cross', absay
[a'bsi] 'melt', adhal 'help', adlal 'dance', adlam [adlam] 'harm, a r d a r
[ae'rdasr] 'betray', ajrah [a'jraeh] 'understand', and ajraw [a'jru] 'get'. Note
that the second and third C's may be identical (this has no morphological
consequence).
For -vPPvC-: addah [a'd:aeh] 'pound (in mortar)', affar [a'fiasr] 'hide',
affay [a'f:i] 'pour', and a m m a r 'look for'. I know of no -vPPvC- verb with
geminate ww (original *ww would presumably be reflected as gg). Verbs with
perfective -sewwaeC- are variants of the -uCvC- stem class, see §7.3.1.6.",[363]

3MaSgS-kill.PerfP-\3MaP10-\Dat-lSg
'He killed them-Ma for me.' (T-md)Here the 3MaPl object has a reduced, arguably V-initial allomorph (/-aen-/)
after the V-final verb (-sgra-), and we get VV-Contraction with /a-ae/
surfacing as e. It appears that this ""fusion"" of object clitic with stem-final V
permits an exception to the first person first rule. However, even here, some
speakers including my primary T-ka informant strongly prefer to allow the first
person first rule to apply, so instead of (686) they have i-qYCi-\0-hi-\taen, with
3MaP10 -\taen at the end.
In the combinations not involving a 1st person clitic, the common
sequence is dative-object. In other words, the object-2 slot is favored for
object clitics. One can account for the data by recognizing (684.b) as the basic
order, while allowing for subsequent ""fronting"" of a lSg or 1P1 form to initial
position within the clitic cluster. However, there are also some attestations of
object-dative order even when a 1st person clitic is not involved, so the
ordering is not rigid.
In the uncommon case where two objects and one dative co-occur, the two
object clitics flank the dative clitic, so we get object-dative-object order.
Some further examples each involving one dative clitic and one object
clitic are in (687). The verb glossed 'kill' can also mean 'hit hard, whack'.
(687.a-b) include a 1st person, while the others do not.

"9.6.3Future (ad, ar, mar, mad, e)The Future particle has a form dd in clause-initial position. It is followed
(after any clitics that may be present) by a Shlmpf or (rarely) LoImpfP verb
stem. I was told by informants that there is a dialectal variant ar, but I cannot
identify the dialect(s) in question, and ad is usual in all the dialects I worked
on.
The d of ad is dropped before any clitic, as in αΑΚί i-wat 'he will hit me'
(lSgO clitic Ahi). Perhaps a trace of the *d lingers in the geminated tt of the
3MaSgO clitic Att (postvocalic allomorph), as in aAtt awat-aer Ί will hit
him', but the geminated tt is now part of the clitic and is also heard after
V-final verb stems (§10.3.1).
The alternation of ad and ά in the Future particle results in partial
convergence between this particle and the combination aAd consisting of a5909 Verb phrases and other predicationsminimal demonstrative ά and a following cliticized Comitative preposition d
(= ad). This a-\d functions as the normal jussive complementizer (§13.3). The
surface convergence of complementizer a - \ d with Fut d d is especially
thoroughgoing in that the -\d in a-\d is omitted if another clitic is present, as in
certain high-frequency adverbial clause types. Therefore both Fut ad and
complementizer a-\d appear as phonetic [ad] without a clitic and as phonetic
[a] before a clitic. Moreover, both occur clause-initially.
However, there is a syntactic distinction between Future ad and the
combination a-\d in the way they combine with negation. The combination
Neg + Fut is expressed as Neg wzer (or a reduced allomorph) plus a distinctive
non-clause-initial Future allomorph such as m a d or e replacing ad (§9.6.4,
below). By contrast, complementizer a-\d is followed by Neg waer. In
addition, Future ad can only be followed by a Shlmpf or (much less often)
LoImpfP stem, whereas complementizer a-\d can be followed by a fuller range
of stems (including perfectives).
In ordinary contexts, the verb stem used after Future ad is the Shlmpf, as
in (641.a). The LoImpfP is much less common, but can be used to specify an
extended time span (641.b).

"3.5.1Prefix Reduction of nouns (dependent state)An important morphological process affecting nouns is that associated with
dependent state (in French usually « etat d'annexion »). This ""state"" is a
cover term for the following syntactic positions: a) complement of a
preposition (dative, possessive, locative), b) compound final (in a few tight
compound constructions like that with erk 'bad', §5.2.4.4); and c) subject
immediately following an inflected verb. In all three cases, the noun in
question can be said to ""depend on"" an immediately preceding word or stem.
If a noun that has a vocalic prefix consisting of a full V (i.e. a noun
beginning with Sg α-, e-, t-α-, t-e-, or PI i- or t-i-) occurs in dependent state,
directly following the preposition, compound initial, or verb on which it
""depends,"" the prefix undergoes Prefix Reduction. There is no other
morphological indication of dependent state (for example, there is no casemarking of subject or prepositional complement), so Prefix-Reduction itself is
as close as we come in this language to structural case-marking. Note that
nouns that do not have a full-V prefix undergo no (audible) reduction of the
prefix.
I use the diacritic 1 before a noun to indicate that it has undergone audible
Prefix Reduction. I do not use the diacritic for other nouns (e.g. those lacking a
full-V vocalic prefix), even when they occur in syntactic positions associated
with dependent state.
The relevant shifts are given in (125).

-ashlaeylasy-. The Resit is -ahilaeylaey- (T-ka) or -ashllaeylasy- (most other
dialects). The derivation of these forms is tricky. Although the initial a in T-ka
could be attributed to Short-V Harmony, there is no evidence in T-ka itself that
the initial vowel is underlying /as/ The representation -ahilaeylaey- makes
perfect sense in T-ka if we have a two-part <H L> melody with the Η attaching
to the first two V's, while the L attaches to the last two V's. In the other
dialects, Resit -aehllaeylasy- requires either a three-part <L Η L> melody, or
the same <H L> melody as in T-ka with a morphologically restricted Melodic
Dissimilation converting initial /a/ to as when the following syllable has a full
high V, as noted in §7.2.2.1, above.

In the Resit stems in (310.a), both lengthening (χ-pcl) and accent (χ-pcl)
are audible. In (310.b), we hear a marked accent (x-pcl), but lengthening
(χ-pcl) conspicuously fails to apply, even though the relevant V is short. This
pattern is characteristic of verbs that are basically adjectival in nature. This
confirms the need for a grammatical distinction between nonadjectival (310.a)
and adjectival (310.b). In (310.c), the marked accent is audible but lengthening
(if present) is not, since the V in question is already a full V. The surface forms
in (310.c) therefore give us no clue as to which stems belong with the
nonadjectival verbs in (310.a), and which belong with the adjectival verbs in
(310.b). Presumably those with adjectival sense, like 'be brown', belong with
(310.b), but there is no way to prove this empirically.
In (310.d-f), we have an i in the Resit. As I analyse these forms, the i is the
result of applying χ-pcl to /a/ (after Melodic Association), where the relevant
schwa is the overt or underlying ν following the first C position of the stem.
For example, 'raise (child)' in (310.d) is -rvbbu- and 'be joyful' in (310.f) is
-hvlvylvy- in their basic lexical representation, and the first short ν is targeted
by χ-pcl, resulting in -arribba- and -ahllasylaey- after all rules have applied. In3087 Verbal morphology(310.g), there is already a full V in the relevant position, so χ-pcl applies
vacuously.
In (310.e-g), because the V targeted by χ-pcl happens to be the antepenult
or earlier, this grammatical accent is overridden by Default Accentuation. In
(310.e-f) at least χ-pcl is audible in the form of the i vowel, but in (3lO.g)
there is no audible difference between the PerfP and the Resit.
In (310.b-c), the only audible distinguishing feature of the Resit is the
accent, either because χ-pcl is suspended (adjectival verbs) or because the
targeted V in question is already full so χ-pcl has no audible effect. If suffixes
and/or clitics are added to Resit verbs of types (310.b-c), so that the
grammatical accent χ-pcl is overridden by Default Accentuation (or by an
accented directional clitic), there is again no audible difference between PerfP
and Resit.
As detailed in §3.5.3.1, §8.5.2, and §12.1, χ-pcl is erased in Resit verbs
and Resit participles in definite relative clauses. This eliminates the
distinguishing i in (310.d-f), and the distinctive lengthening of the finalsyllable stem-vowel in (310.a). However, the erasure does not affect χ-pcl (i.e.
accent), so certain types of verbs maintain the PerfP/Reslt opposition even in
definite relative clauses, viz., the verbs in (310.a-d), provided that the accented
V is in the penult or final of the word and is not followed by an accented
directional clitic or by a suffix that forces penultimate accent.
In light V-final stems, i.e. -VC(C)u- (V = short or full vowel, υ = full
vowel), e.g. 'go to' in (309.c) with PerfP -skka- and Resit -akkd-, the only
difference is accent when no subject suffix is added: 3MaSg PerfP 1-kka, Resit
i-kkd. However, when subject suffixes are added to light V-final verbs, the
suffix creates an environment that permits χ-pcl (in addition to χ-pcl) to
apply. Thus 3MaPl PerfP Skkae-n (with Presuffixal α-Shortening (112) and
VV-Contraction (37.d)) and Resit a k k d - n , 3FePl akkae-naet and Resit
skkd-naet, where the Resit forms have a lengthened as well as accented stemfinal ά. For all other verb types, including heavy V-final verbs and all C-final
verbs, suffixes are not a factor in ablaut. This shows that the scope of ablaut,
in the case of light V-final verbs, consists of the stem plus up to the first
suffixal C, hence all of 3MaPl /akka-aen/, and all of 3FePl /akka-nast/ except
the final ast. In §7.2.2.3, below, we will see that the same definition of domain
works for PerfN ablaut.
In causatives, a Resit stem beginning in -s-ί... might be mistaken (by a
non-native speaker) for a LoImpfP. This is because many causative LoImpfP
forms begin in -s-ί... . However, the Resit stem will always have a low V at
least in its final syllable, while a LoImpfP stem beginning with i (i.e. with <H>
melody) will have high vowels through to the end of the stem.
Examples of the resultative are in (311).

"3.2.1.2Nasal assimilation and dissimilationIn most dialects, /n/ appears as [m] before a labial stop { b p } , and as velar or
uvular [q] before stops {g k Y}. In the cluster η γ , the γ is pronounced as
uvular stop or affricate (§3.1.1.3). Observable alternations occur primarily in
verbs whose first C is a nasal. Two examples: 1) PerfP -smbasr- '(herd) be
taken to pasture at night' and variant VblN t - a - m b s r - t versus LoImpfP
-ndbbaer- and VblN a-naebar ; 2) PerfP -3ητα- 'kill' versus LoImpfP -naqqand VblN t-e-naeYe. The most obvious analysis for these cases is that the /n/ is
basic but undergoes point-of-articulation assimilation to an immediately
following C.
One could alternatively argue that an initial /m/ or /q/ shifts to n steminitially. This is dubious for /q/ since the velar nasal is a marginal phoneme in
prevocalic position (§3.1.1.2). However, this analysis is fairly credible for /m/,
since /m/ in verb prefixes (there is no /m/ in nominal prefixes) shifts to n when
the stem contains a labial. The prefixes in question are Mediopassive (§8.3)
and Agentive (§8.8). By extending this dissimilation to e.g. -nabbaer(preceding paragraph), one could actually argue for a basic lexical
representation with /m/ instead of /n/.
On the whole, I prefer the nasal-assimilation analysis, since it makes more
sense for the alternations of n with q.",[64]
"5.2 Possession and compounding261A handful of kin terms take a special set of pronominal possessive suffixes
given in (251), below. Since these nouns are a subset of the (semantically)
inalienable nouns in the language, for lack of a better term I call these suffixes
inalienable. The stems in question are V-final, so there is only one suffixal
series. All of the suffixes are distinct from their counterparts in the regular
possessive series (§5.2.2, just above). The Ο before some suffixes indicates
that the suffix forces penultimate word accent.
The postconsonantal allomorphs for singular possessors are difficult to
elicit. The inalienable noun stems that end in a C are plural: taey- 'fathers
(of...)' and maessaw- 'owners/masters (of...)', and they normally require
plural possessors, as in täey-naer 'our fathers' and maessaw-kmaet 'your-FePl
masters'. In Tuareg society, one does not easily speak of the 'fathers' or
'masters' of a single person or object. In the case of 'father', the synonym
abba (250) can be used in its plural form (with alienable possessor suffix).
When pressed to combine Sg possessor suffixes with taey- or maessaw-,
informants grudgingly add -(e)v, -k, -m, and -s with no phonological difficulty
but find the combinations awkward. With maessaw- 'owners', I recorded lSg
maessaw-r (T-ka), maessaw-ex (R), and maessaw-i (A-grm).

"I know of no stem that has two distinct sibilants in T-ka. It may very well
be that sibilant harmony is a stem-wide constraint rather than something
specific to the Causative suffix. Examples are in (452).

respect Sibilant Harmony. All causatives that are in common use respect
harmony (in T-ka). Harmony seems to be less reliable in R and A-grm, though
this comment is based on elicited examples. I recorded P e r f P
-aes-raerzaezzaew- and later -aez-vaerzaszzaew- from the R speaker for 'fell
(tree)'. Another R form is PerfP -aes-kaerzaszzaew- 'cluck (tongue)'. A-grm
PerfP -s-aeffaenasssae-t 'break (melon) open with hand' is another nonharmonic example.
For -vnsu- 'be sold (or bought)', the causative is -s-vnso- for R and T-ka
but -z-vnsu- for other dialects (A-grm I K-d). Here we get positional but not
voicing harmony. The causative is much more common than the intransitive;
with different directional clitics it is the basic verb for 'buy', 'sell', and
'barter'.
A-grm causative -s-vzvd- and K-d unsegmentable - s v z z v d - 'prostrate
oneself (in prayer' are borrowed from Classical Arabic root Vsjd (j is
pronounced ζ in Hassaniya Arabic). T-ka causative -s-vjvd- (same gloss) does
not violate Sibilant Harmony.
The simple verb 'laugh' has C's d...z when separated by a V, but ts
varying with ts when clustered, e.g. PerfP -stsa- (-atsa-) and LoImpfP -ddzz-.
In the causative, the C's in question are always clustered. There is a (faint)
possibility of deriving ts from underlying /dz/, and if native speakers agreed
we could, in theory, have -z- as Causative prefix. In fact, we get -s- (e.g. PerfP
-sss-atsa-), showing that native speakers take the stem-internal sibilant to be s
(or possibly s) instead of z.","[461, 462]"
"10.3.2 Dative clitics
Pronominal dative clitics are shown in (673). The clitics show no sign of the
prenominal Dative preposition e or 1 (y-) (§6.3). Instead, the basic Dative
morpheme in clitics is Aha-, reduced in some contexts to Aa-, and for T-ka
reduced in some other contexts to Aha-. The lSg and 1P1 dative clitics are
identical to the corresponding object clitics, but the 2nd and 3rd persons
distinguish dative from object clitics.

The ""full"" forms are used in the following cases: a) when the dative
immediately follows an object clitic (in preverbal or postverbal position); b)
when the dative is postverbal and follows a high V {i u}. The ""preverbal""
column shows the form taken by the clitic when they immediately follow
preverbal particles Negative waer or Future ad (which is always reduced to ά
before clitics), or a focalized constituent (e.g. mi 'who?' in questions). The
-\ha- of the full form is deleted in the lSg form, and reduced to - \ h a elsewhere. The remaining columns show the forms in postverbal position after
a C (the h of the full form is dropped), and after α (the h is dropped and the
two α vowels contract into one).
Instead of taking underlying /-ha-/ as the lexical form of the Dative
morpheme and having the /h/ deleted in some positions, one could
alternatively take the morpheme as /-a-/ and posit an h-Insertion rule (like
that given for directional clitics in §10.2.1.1). However, the phonological
distribution of the /h/ in the datives is extensive, including some postconsonantal positions where an h-Insertion rule would have little motivation.
This is unlike the case with Centripetal Aadd, where a minor h-Insertion rule
seems warranted.
Data from dialects other than T-ka (e.g. K-d R T-md) differ in the respects
indicated in (674).
(674)Dialectal Variants (non-T-ka)

us' with T-ka i-t-iwl-\ha-naer. In practice, given the paucity of verb forms
ending in a high V, these combinations are infrequent.
The preverbal forms are used when the clitic is hosted by a preverbal
particle, usually Negative wzer or a Future marker like ad (which reduces to a
before a clitic) Interrogatives like mi 'who?' and other fronted focalized
constituents can also be followed by a clitic. In my T-ka data, the usual -\haformative is reduced to -\ha- in this position. No reduction occurs in examples
from other dialects. The lSg is -\hi in this position in all dialects.

"2.3 Prefix Reduction
It was mentioned above that nouns express (local) dependency on a preceding
element by undergoing Prefix Reduction. This applies to a subject (but not
object) noun after a verb, to a noun functioning as complement of a
preposition, and to a noun stem functioning as a compound final.
Most nouns have a vocalic prefix -i- in the plural. This PI prefix is audibly
reduced to -9- or zero in the relevant syntactic positions. These same nouns
have a vocalic prefix -α-, -e-, -as-, or -a- in the singular. Of these Sg prefixes,
-ae- and -a- are already short vowels and cannot be audibly reduced. However,
-a- and -e- are reduced to a short vowel, either -a- or -ae- depending on dialect
and on the height of the vowel of the following syllable. Nouns that do not
have a segmentable vocalic prefix are unaffected by Prefix Reduction.
The position of the accent is unaffected by Prefix Reduction. In particular,
if the vocalic prefix happens to be accented, its reduced variant (other than
zero) continues to bear accent. In cases where PI vocalic prefix -i- is reduced
to zero, the accent shifts to the preceding syllable (i.e. to the final syllable of
the preceding word). Thus t-Vhatt-en 'sheep-Pi' occurs in the locative PP dasr
""t-3-hatt-en 'in the sheep', with a dialectal variant (e.g. K-d) dser ""t-^-hatt-en.
Where Prefix Reduction has applied audibly, the symbol Ί is given at the
beginning of the word in question. Thus e-haen 'house' has a reduced form
""ae-hasn.",[33]
"Except as noted below ('drink'), resyllabification does not apply when the
verb stem in question is followed by a V-initial suffix or clitic. This cannot be
explained as Syncope applying to a previously resyllabified sequence, since
there is no evidence for Stem-Final Gemination in the relevant suffixal
combinations, and since Short-V Harmony (§3.2.6) does not affect the first
syllable in Imprt or other verbs. Thus for - v r r u - 'read', T-ka Imprt /asm/—»
/aerr/ —> a r a r 'read!' without further suffix or clitic, but serr-\e 'read it!' with
V-initial 3MaSg object clitic.
However, in the specific case of -vswu- 'drink', the resyllabified variant
-3S3W occurs (in several dialects) before the 3MaSg object clitic, which
therefore takes its postvocalic allomorph -\tt. Probably -asaw [ssu:1] has been
reanalysed as -ssu, resulting in this (dialectal) generalization. For Sg Imprt
'drink it-Ma!' we therefore get, depending on the dialect, two results. The first
type is seen in A-grm aeswAi and T-ka aeswAe, parallel to aevrAe 'read it!' and
2eks-\e 'eat it!'. Here -\e (including A-grm variant -\i) is the postconsonantal
allomorph of the 3MaSgO object clitic. The second type is seen in asüAtt (K-d
K-f R Ts) and asiiAtti (Im), where the clitic has a postvocalic allomorph.",[85]

TextThe following text was recorded from a T-ka speaker in 2002. It was
transcribed from dictation, allowing the speaker to repeat the sentences. My
other textual material is transcribed from recorded dialogues, and the reason
for choosing monologue dictation in this case was to allow the speaker to
smooth out the accentual phrasing (which can be ragged in spontaneous
dialogue due to the fact that phrasal accents work from right to left. Where
they are clear, I use brackets here to indicate the accentual phrases of more
than one word, not (as in the grammar proper) to indicate syntactic bracketing.

[same as for u]Resyllabification (Final-CC Schwa-Insertion)Resyllabification occurs when an unstable word-final CC cluster results from
the deletion of a final V. The relevant rule is Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29)
(§3.1.2.4). The deletion rule applies to short imperfectives and VblN's of
V-final verbs. These verbs have a clear word-final α in the perfective stem
system, but some of them have short imperfective (including Imprt) ending in
III, an abstract, underspecified V. Many of the verbs are of the basic shape
-vCCu- or -u>CCi>, and when the final υ is deleted we get a CC cluster. Some
CC clusters are stable in word-final position. However, if the cluster is not a
geminate, and if the final C is a sonorant, it cannot be pronounced as such, so
resyllabification is required.
An example is /askni/, Sg Imprt of 'make', which appears as akan in T-ka,
but as akan in most other dialects. Compare PerfP -akna-, which shows the
stem-final V more clearly (-vkno-). Another verb, in form perhaps the
causative of this -vknu-, is -s-vkni> 'show', with Imprt s-akan (A-grm T-ka)
or s-akan (Im K-d R T-md). Because -s-vknu-, unlike -vknu-, is long enough
to quality for the VblN type with a - Sg prefix and <H> vocalic melody, we get
VblN / a - s - a k n i / in T-ka and several other dialects, and this too must be
resyllabified when the III is deleted. The Sg VblN appears variably as
α-s-akann (T-ka), α - s - a k a n (Im R), α-s-akan (T-md), or α-s-kan (K-d),623Phonologydepending on what other rules apply (gemination, syncope, accent shift).
A-grm, on the other hand, has a-s-akni, retaining the original final V, so no
resyllabification is needed there.
As these examples show, resyllabification takes the form of insertion of a
(Final-CC Schwa-Insertion, see below) to break up a nongeminate final CC
cluster whose second element is a sonorant, and is accompanied in T-ka by
accent shift onto the epenthetic schwa and by gemination of the final C. The
accent shift (Epenthetic-Vowel Accentuation) and the doubling of the final
sonorant in the VblN and other nominalizations (Stem-Final Gemination) are
covered in §3.3.2. Both processes are characteristic of T-ka but do not apply in
most other dialects. Even in T-ka, neither is a general phonological rule,
though both are parasitic on Final-CC Schwa-Insertion.
Final-CC Schwa-Insertion also feeds Short-V Harmony, though this
interaction is somewhat difficult to analyse. The relevant fact here is the shift
of the initial /as/ in e.g. /askni/ 'make!-Sg' to a in akan, apparently under the
influence of the medial schwa. See §3.2.6, below, for discussion.
Consider the data in (43), which show the morphological contexts where
Resyllabification can occur. In all cases the stem in question is an
unaugmented verb whose final V is deletable.

The only verbs of shape -uPQu- with two full V's, where Q is a sonorant,
are (PerfP) -olwa- 'be spacious' and -odwa- 'leave in afternoon'. The only
respect in which they differ from the -vPQu- verbs is insofar as their long
imperfectives are also subject to resyllabification.
I know of one underived (and unaugmented) -CvPQu- verb of the same
type, namely -lvjwu- 'bend, veer' (PerfP -allajwa-, LoImpfP -t-alaejwa-, but
Imprt laejaew from /laejwi/ and VbIN a-bjsww from /-lsjwi/.
This leaves -vPQu- verbs as the overwhelmingly most common stems
subject to resyllabification. The following stems are affected (they are shown
in the resyllabified Sg Imprt, for underlying /asPQi/): s r a r [asras'r] 'read!' or
'call!', sjal 'go!', akan 'do (well)!', skal 'spend mid-day!', asal 'hear!', and643 Phonology3S3W 'drink!'. A larger set of -vPQu- stems end in stable CC clusters in the Sg
Imprt and so do not undergo resyllabification: (Imprt) aebs 'vomit!', aetf 'be
poured!' (Vdf), sets 'laugh' (Vdz), aert 'be implanted!', aeks 'sprout!', aels 'get
dressed!', aelz 'shave!', aend 'collapse!', aeijY 'kill!', aens 'lie down!', sens 'be
sold!' or 'excuse!', zent 'begin!', aerv 'be on fire!', aerh 'want!', and aerz
'break!'. Note that these all involve an obstruent or h as final C. I know of no
-vPQu- stems where Ρ and Q are both sonorants and do not form a geminate.
There is no resyllabification when the cluster is geminate, even when it is a
sonorant: aekk 'go (to)', aezz 'weave!', aenn 'say!'. In the one case involving h
preceding a sonorant, the necessity for resyllabification is avoided, since the
two C's are metathesized (§3.2.2.1) when not separated by a V: 'weep'
(LoImpfP -hall- with Vhl, but PerfP -alha- and Imprt aelh with Vlh).
Resyllabification is blocked in most cases when the verb form in question
is followed by a V-initial suffix or clitic. This is regularly the case with
inflected verbs (including imperatives). Thus 2Sg Imprt assl 'hear!' but 2MaPl
Imprt aesl-aet, the latter having the same shape as the 2MaPl forms of nonresyllabifying verbs, e.g. äebs-set 'vomit!-MaPl'. For the agentives and VblN's,
resyllabification is likewise blocked when a PI suffix (MaPl -aen, here realized
as -an) is added; see the plurals given in parentheses in (43). However, in the
T-ka VblN (and certain minor nominals) that show Stem-Final Gemination, the
geminate is retained when possessive suffixes are added, hence a-s-akann
'showing', a-s-akann-in 'my showing' (not #a-s-3kn-in as wel might expect
on the basis of unpossessed PI i-s-akn-an).
In the case of Vsw 'drink' and its derivatives, the only set where the final
C is w, the resyllabified form -ssaw is pronounced [-asu1] and can be treated
as V-final at least for purposes of assigning allomorphs (postvocalic versus
postconsonantal) to a following clitic. Thus Imprt 3saw-\tt occurs dialectally
as an alternative to aesw-\e 'drink it-MaSg!'. The latter variant shows the
pattern that is obligatory in other resyllabifying verbs, e.g. aevr-\e 'read it!'.
However, in the more easterly dialects, the number of forms subject to
Stem-Final i/A-Deletion is diminished, which of course limits the scope of
resyllabification. For example, the high-frequency motion verb -vjlu- (eastern
-vglu-) 'go' has short imperfectives that undergo Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29)
in a few dialects (A-grm T-ka T-md), but not elsewhere (Gao K-d K-f Ts), e.g.
T-ka Sg Imprt ejal 'go!' versus K-d aglu. Likewise, the long imperfectives of
verbs like -ulwu- 'be spacious' show Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29) in some
dialects (K-d R T-ka) but keep the stem-final V in others (A-grm Gao R), e.g
T-ka 3MaSg LoImpfP i-t-ilsw versus Gao i-t-llwa.
The most systematic dialectal difference is in the VblN's of prefixally
derived stems. For example, T-ka α-s-ilaww 'making spacious' (PI
l-s-alw-αη) corresponds to A-grm a-s-alwi, and T-ka a-s-akann 'showing' (PI
l-s-skn-an) corresponds to A-grm a-s-akni (PI i-s-akni-taen).
On occasion I have recorded Imprt and Shlmpf verb forms ending in
Augment -t, although the verb in question is not otherwise of the augment
class. This tends to happen in elicitation of paradigms of less common heavy3.2 Local assimilations and syllabification rules65verbs. Example: for the T-md informant, 'become long (or tall)' was recorded
as PerfP sajra-, Imprt sljra-t, and LoImpfP -t-lsajru-. The Imprt form here also
shows the i...a vocalism typical of the imperfective of adjectival verbs. This
verb shows up in other dialects either as an augmented verb (PerfP -assagrae-t
in A-grm, for example), or as an unaugmented verb with final stem consonant t
(PerfP sajrat- in several dialects); see §7.3.2.2. The T-md speaker appears to
have made selective, opportunistic use of the augment option to avoid having
to resyllabify the Imprt stem.
The formulation of the Final-CC Schwa-Insertion rule is tricky, since the
epenthetic V appears as a in most cases, e.g. alaw 'be spacious!', but appears
as ae in m-aesaew 'be drunk!' and e-m-aesaeww 'drinker; water source'. In three
morphological patterns we get a. One is the VblN type for derived or long
underived verbs, where the entire stem is subject to a <H> vocalic melody, so
schwa is the expected short V: α-m-asaww 'being drunk', α-s-ilaww 'making
spacious'. A second is the set of imperfectives like (Caus) Imprt s-ilaw 'make
spacious!' and Lolmpf -t-ilaw 'is spacious', where we again assume a stemwide <H> melody (underlying /s-ilwi/, /-t-ilwi/). The third is the underived
short imperfective of type Imprt ajal 'go!' and alaw 'be spacious!', where the
epenthetic schwa breaks up a CC cluster that separates underlying <L> and
<H> melodic components (/acjli/, /alwi/). Here it is not clear whether the
schwa is determined by the <H> melodic component, or is simply the default
epenthetic vowel.
This leaves mediopassive Imprt m-aesasw 'be drunk!' and e-m-aesaeww
'drinker; water source', from -vswu- 'drink'. For m-aesaew, the basic form is
arguably / m - a e s w A / instead of / m - a e s w i / , since mediopassive short
imperfectives favor <L> melody. In the case of e-m-aesaeww 'drinker; water
source', in the agentive interpretation 'drinker' we would probably expect a
composite <H L> melody; compare e-m-aeks 'eater', feminine counterpart
t-e-m-aeksi-t-t with stem-final i. I know of one other agentive of this type,
e-m-aeraerr 'reader, pupil' from - v r r u - 'read', e-m-aesaeww in the sense
'water source' is a nonagentive nominal and might have a stem-wide <L>
melody, but agentives e-m-asvaerr and e-m-assaeww presumably have <L H>
melody like other agentives of -vCCi> stems. Given that Imprt /aeswi/ and
/aerri/ appear as asaw (or a s u ) and a r a r , while agentives /e-m-aeswi/ and
/e-m-aerri/ appear as e-m-aesaeww and e-m-aeraerr, it is necessary to explain
why the L part of the <L H> melody extends to the epenthetic V in the
agentives but not in the Imprt. Pending further dialectological study, it is far
from clear that Stem-Final Gemination (which is limited to T-ka nominals,
including VblN's and agentives) is correlated with this difference in melodic
domain. For now I will simply stipulate the difference as a morphophonological fact (45).","[80, 81, 82, 83, 84]"
"2324 Nominal and pronominalmorphologyThe gemination formative Γ-f is reliably attached in the PI to a previously
simple stem-final C following a short V (including one due to V-Shortening),
see (206.a,c). Of course Γ-f has no effect if the C in question is already
geminated or otherwise clustered (206.b,d,e). When the final C is preceded by
a full V, Final Gemination does not occur in my T-ka data, but was observed
more often than not in A-grm, see (206.f,g).
The minor types grouped in (206.h), in several cases limited to A-grm
dialect, generally involve final semivowels. The A-grm form 'storage area' is
unusual only insofar as the Sg already has stem accent. 'Front leg' has a Sg
stem-shape -hi- before FeSg suffix complex -t-t, a position where i is
sometimes analysable as /ay/. The PI -hiww has ""grown"" a w. This PI has no
regular phonological derivation, but there is a pattern of vowel-semivowel
dissimilation (§3.4.10, §4.1.2.17). For 'origin, homeland', Sg stem -ihi-t-t is
compatible with a representation /-ihay-/, and the A-grm PI t-ihi could be
interpreted as having a stem /-ihayy/ compatible with the -CaPP- pattern in
(206.a-b). 'Beaded necklace' has Sg -sasfa, but its plural -sfaww is based on a
theoretical Sg variant /-saefaw/, compare the cases with Syncope and
V-Shortening in (206.c). For 'fire, hell', the A-grm PI - m a s s for Sg -mse
shows Stem-Final V-Deletion, followed by Schwa-Insertion to give the stem a
minimal syllabic shape. A parallel derivation applies to 'folding'.
Disregarding some irregularities in (206.f-h), and assuming for the
moment a componential rather than templatic PI ablaut, the ingredients needed
to convert Sg to PI in (206) are summarized in (207).
(207)Processes Applying to Final-Accent Ablaut Plurals
accent formative χ-f on final syllable
gemination formative Γ-f (at least after short V) targeting final C
V-Shortening (applies to second syllable of -CvCuC- stems)
Syncope (applies to /a/ in stem-initial -CaCV... stems after prefix)
<H> melody on stem
Stem-Final V-Deletion (for stems of at least two syllables)Let us consider a sample derivation of one of the plurals, assuming a
componential ablaut for these plurals. Obviously we should try to make as
much use as possible of the machinery already needed for other (unsuffixed)
ablaut plurals, i.e. the <H L> melody and the χ-f (V-length) formative.
Consider the Sg to PI transitions in (208).","[250, 251]"
"3.1.1.3Uvulars (r q)q is common as a phonetic entity but has marginal phonemic status. Most cases
of phonetic [q] are in the geminated form qq, word-medially or -finally, and
these can be interpreted as the phonetic realization of geminated / r r / , The
conversion of /YY/ to q q is productive, and applies not only word-internally
but also over word boundaries (§3.2.1.1).
Within words, we have cases of morphological gemination such as
/i-avmbb-aet/ >l-qqubb-aet 'he gulped', cf. verbal noun a - r a b b u 'gulping'.
At a nonprefixal morpheme boundary (with a suffix or clitic), q q often
represents Μ or IrkJ, as when a morpheme otherwise ending in γ is followed
by a morpheme otherwise consisting of or beginning in t or k (e.g. FeSg -t,
3MaPl object clitic -t, or any of the pronominal clitics beginning in k). An
example is the name of the language, / t - a 2 - m d : s a e v - t / > t-£e-ma:saeq-q
'Tamashek'; see §3.2.1.1 for more detail. In these cases, the effect is a
bidirectional feature assimilation whereby the t or k adopts the uvular position
of the Y while the latter adopts a voiceless stop articulation.
At word boundaries, we have such examples as preposition dser 'in' plus
any noun beginning in Y, e.g. DA2Y Yussast 'in August', often pronounced
[dajqiu'J'iaet]. Another recurring combination is a verb ending in lSgS -3ΪΥ
followed by particle Yds 'only'.
While /YY/ is regularly realized as qq, there are hints that ungeminated q
may be on the way to becoming a phoneme distinct from Y. This is because q
as well as γ can occur in ungeminated position. While γ is much more
common, there are some cases of q in Arabic borrowings, as in PerfP -aqbael'consent' (imperative aqbal, LoImpfP -qdbbael-, cf. noun aelqabdla, all from
Arabic qbl 'accept'). Contrast this with a native stem like -SYbaer- 'kick with
heel' (Imprt 3Ybsr, LoImpfP -Yabbaer-). There are also dialectally sporadic
cases of ungeminated q in non-borrowed vocabulary, especially where back-263Phonologyformation from geminated qq may be involved. An example of internal backformation is the verb 'sit' (§7.3.2.9), which often appears in the perfective or
resultative stem, which involve gemination to q q (PerfP - a j q q i m a - , etc.). For
some speakers we also (by back-formation) get ungeminated q rather than γ in
forms like Imprt q a y a m (variant q a m ) alongside r a y m , where I interpret the
variants with q as influenced by the qq of the perfectives.
In the combination η γ , often representing alveolar η plus Y, the γ
approaches the stop articulation [q], or an affricated articulation that sounds
like phonetic [q Y ]. The most common case is the verb 'kill', P e r f P -aqYa[-sqq^a-], but e.g. VblN t-e-naeYe with intervening vowel. I do not use "" q ""
here in phonemic transcriptions, since I am not convinced that the segment in
question is completely voiceless in this position; an instrumental phonetic
study would be useful. N o similar affrication occurs in m r , e.g. i - n w a d
'vassals' (PI of a-m3Yid).
While there is incipient phonemic splitting of q and Y, the alternation of
ungeminated γ and geminated q q remains quite fundamental. For purposes of
alphabetizing dictionary entries, I treat q as though γ (i.e. immediately
following g).","[44, 45]"
"3.4 Ablaut
3.4.6121From <H L> to pure <L> melody (PerfP verbs)In §3.4.3.2, above, we saw that while a great many verbs have <H L> melody
in perfectives, another large set of verbs has a stem-wide <L> perfective
melody. The issue to be discussed here is whether the <L> melody can be
reduced to <H L>. Since the stems in question have at least two syllables, and
usually three or more, there is no obvious reason why the Η component of
<H L> should be unable to associate audibly with at least the stem-initial
syllable. However, the <H> melody is in a one-to-one relationship (in T-ka and
other dialects, except A-grm). Given this correlation, the possibility of a
phonological motivation for the <H> perfective melody should be considered.
I will exclude from this discussion the unusual perfectives of adjectival
verbs. These adjectival perfectives are typically C-initial (§7.3.1.11), but
nonetheless fail to accept subject prefixes, including 3MaSg i-. Many of these
adjectival perfectives have stem-wide (usually bisyllabic) <H> vocalism, but
others have <L> vocalism. The perfective stems of these adjectival verbs often
diverge sharply in shape from imperfectives, and generally behave as
lexicalized, idiosyncratic perfective stems. I choose not to decompose them
into ablaut components.
With the adjectival stems excluded, we turn to examples like those in (94).

reconcile the loss, by Stem-Initial Syncope, of the short V following χ in PerfP
-aexbabas-t with the observation that the syncope rule elsewhere specifically
targets a and does not affect ae. This ceases to be a problem if the syncopated
V is schwa at the point when Stem-Initial Syncope applies, as in the derivation
(95).","[139, 140]"
"In the initial (=penultimate) syllable, the underived stems have a full V in
the imperfective (i or u) and a short V in the perfective (normally a for T-ka
and A-grm, normally ae for other dialects). In (458.b-c), the causative sides
with the underived imperfective in this respect and shows a full V immediately
following the prefixal sibilant. In the other cases, the causative agrees with the
underived perfective, so following the prefixal sibilant we get a short V. In the
causative perfective, this short V is then syncopated (Stem-Initial Syncope)
where syllabically possible, i.e. in an open syllable (458.a, e-g), and it is
preserved otherwise (458.d).
There is some ambiguity here as to the (morpho-)phonological processes
involved. Most (but not all) cases of preservation of initial full V in the
causatives involve u rather than i, but this division does not work cleanly. In
addition, most cases of preservation involve non-adjectival senses (458.b-c),
while most that undergo shortening in the causative are adjectival in sense, but
again this correlation is not clean. I formulate (460) half-heartedly to account
for (some of) the data above, repeated from (124). If the causative is based, in
the relevant cases, on the underived perfective rather than imperfective, the
rule is not needed.
(460)Causative Initial V-Shortening (repeated from (124))
A full V in the first syllable of an underived bisyllabic
imperfective -i/uC(C)aC- verb is reduced to a short V in the basic
form of the causative, [with exceptions; rule assumes that input is
underived imperfective]Both Causative Final-Syllable V-Shortening and Causative Initial
V-Shortening (if the latter is valid at all) could be described as pre-ablaut
reconfigurations, since they apply across the full set of causative stems. These
two rules are complemented by Causative Medial V-Shortening (122), see
(468), below.
While (458.b-c) suggest an alignment of the causative with the underived
imperfective, insofar as they both show a full u or i in the onset of the stem
proper, it is not completely out of the question to take the underived perfective
shape -v(C)Ci/uC- as basic to both. Comparison with such cases as (PerfP =4548 Verbal derivationShlmpf) - a n d u - 'be churned' and its causative -s-undu- 'churn' (PerfP
-ass-unda-, etc., see (467), below) shows that a second-syllable high V in the
input can be transposed to the preceding syllable in the causative. But if 'be
churned' is analysed as having basic form -undu- to begin with, becoming
-vndu- by u-Spreading and Medial V-Shortening (before a CC cluster), cf.
§7.3.1.4, no leftward movement of the features of u would be involved, so the
comparison with causatives in (458), above, would not be instructive.
For the record, the full set of stem forms for 'suck', the causative of 'be

PerfP shape -aPQa-. As indicated in §7.3.1.3, underived verbs of this type
have a complex phonology. The Shlmpf is /-aePQi-/ with a deletable high V
that affects accentuation and contracts with suffix-initial /ae/ to produce a.
When III is deleted word-finally (29), a resulting final PQ cluster requires
resyllabification (§3.2.4, §3.3.2) if Q is more sonorous than P. These
phonological alternations are carried over into prefixal derivatives, including
causatives. In (462) I show both resyllabifying and stable types and give
underlying schemas for the stems that have lost (word-finally and in most
suffixal combinations) the stem-final V. The paradigms are valid for T-ka;

pronouns). The 3Sg form ends in t in T-ka, in s in most other dialects (A-grm,
R, T-md).
Parenthesized Ο before an allomorph indicates that the preceding syllable
(the word penult) is accented, even with nouns that would otherwise be
accented on an earlier syllable. In other words, the possessor suffixes in
question force penultimate word accent; cf. §3.3.1.1. In full word
transcriptions, such a suffixally induced accent is written as v, where ν is any
vowel. Note that the invariant forms in the leftmost column also have marked
penultimate accent. However, the 2Sg and 3Sg postconsonantal variants
(-annaek, etc.), take default accents.
Examples showing the allomorphy are ISg mataji-nin 'my peanuts'
(mataji), e-hsen-nin 'my house' (e-haen), and alsibb-in 'my pocket' (slsibb);
and 3Sg matajl-nnet, e-hsen-net, and alsibb-annet. The postconsonantal forms
like 2MaSg -annask are used after any C other than n, including other
sonorants like {1 m r}, as in a-laemom-annaek 'your-MaSg young dama2605 Noun phrase structuregazelle', a-saerol-annet 'his/her young ram', and a-kasbor-annasm 'your-FeSg
sparrow' (from a-lsemom, a-saerol, a-kaebor).
Possessor suffixes are added to the last element in the core NP, which
includes demonstratives. Any ""adjectives"" or other relative clauses follow

"3.4.2.2Plain/geminate alternations in nominal Sg/PlPhonetically, h and to a lesser extent (tap) r tend to resist audible gemination
(i.e. increased duration), though at least in careful speech a morphologically
expected gemination can be audible.
Variation between geminated and ungeminated C's occurs in certain
nominal singular/plural alternations. In some cases it is not clear that stemwide ablaut is at hand. The following patterns can be distinguished.
First, in the type Sg t-a-duf-t 'wool', PI t-l-duff-en, it would seem that the
FeSg suffix -t forces Degemination of the geminate, which would therefore
be present underlyingly even in the Sg (so no ablaut-induced gemination
process need be recognized). In the full set of known examples (given in (152)
in §4.1.2.8), the degeminated C is from the set [ y w r m f}, i.e. sonorants and
fricatives. The phonology here is somewhat opaque, and there is some dialectal
variation in detail.
Second, there are some masculines with Sg -CVP (V a full high vowel)
and PI I-CaPP-asn, e.g. ά-ril 'right hand', PI l-rall-asn. This is a rather
specialized Sg/Pl pattern with a semi-templatic look. For examples and
discussion see (153) in §4.1.2.8.
Third, there are a small number of cases like e-raess 'bone', PI i-raes-an,
where the Sg ends in a geminate, but where the PI shows an ungeminated C
before the MaPl suffix. The MaPl allomorph -an instead of -asn, combined
with the accent shift in the PI and the absence of a PI ablaut melody, show that
the PI is of the underlying type /-raesV-aen/ with some stem-final V. Therefore
we have a phonologically obscure alternation between a geminate PP and PV.
For more examples and discussion see (155) in §4.1.2.8.
Fourth, there are some cases where a medial or final geminate in the Sg is
degeminated in order to fit the stem into the templatic shape -CsCC-, as
mentioned in §3.4.1.5, above. Example: a-hajjar 'acacia pod', PI l-hsjr-an.
See (180) in §4.1.2.14 for more details.
Finally, there are two unsuffixed ablaut PI patterns that also involve
gemination in the PI only. These are probably the best candidates for a true
ablaut formative T-c2 outside of verbal morphology.
One type ((205.a) in §4.1.2.23), applying to Sg type t-a-CCsC-t (a fairly
common deverbal nominalization, but including some underived nouns), is
exemplified by t - a - f t s q - q 'laying out', PI t-i-föttar. The vocalism and
V-length patterns of the PI are consistent with PI ablaut. There are a few
similar plurals for nouns of the Sg type t-a/e-CvCuC-t with a full vowel υ in
the final syllable (205.b). Note in particular the short ""v"" in the position
corresponding to the a in the PI. An example: t-a-jSzel-t 'kidney', PI
t-i-jszzal. With cases like 'kidney' in mind, one could argue that t-a-ftsq-q3.4 Ablaut109has been syncopated from underlying /t-a-fatar-t/ (leaving aside the question
of whether the first schwa is lexically accented). If so, the only unusual feature
of PI t-i-fattar and t-i-jazzal is the gemination. One might venture the guess
that the gemination is ""designed"" to protect the short V from the threat of
Syncope, but the forms are highly morphologized, and there are plenty of
similar cases among ablaut plurals where Syncope does apply, e.g. a-daris
'track', ablaut PI i-dras (but A-grm i-daras).
In any event, cases like t-i-fattar require a gemination formative Γ-ο2 as
an add-on to the usual nominal PI ablaut, to account for gemination of the
second stem C.
The same seems at first sight to be true of a specifically feminine type,
where the Sg is of the type t-a/e-CaePe and the PI is t-i-CaPP (§4.1.2.24).
Many but not all of these are VblN's of light V-final stems. Example: t-a-haela
'weeping' with PI t-i-hall. The PI vocalism is quite different from that of most
ablaut plurals, whose hallmark is a final-syllable a. One can partially
reintegrate t-i-hall into the mainstream by assuming that the L part of the PI
<H L> melody targets a deletable stem-final V, and is therefore inaudible on
the surface. The PI would therefore be something like /t-i-hallA/ with deletable
low vowel /A/. In this derivation, which I will question in a moment, the type
/t-i-hallA/ is roughly parallel in structure to the type t-i-fattar (preceding
paragraph). Since gemination affects the second stem C, in this case the 1 of Sg
t-a-haela, one could argue that T-c2 is at work in PI t-i-hall just as in t-i-fattar.
However, this won't work, and it will be necessary to dissociate the PI
types t-i-hall and t-i-fattar. To begin with, note that t-i-hall has a marked
accent on the surface final syllable (underlying penult), and this accent is not
carried over from the Sg (unaccented t-ahaela). In regular PI ablaut, an
accent in the Sg is carried over to the PI, with some exceptions (irrelevant
here) where a Sg accent is deleted in the PI. It may seem as though PI
t-i-fattar also shows an unusual accent shift vis-a-vis Sg t-o-ftaq-q, but if we
represent the stem here as /-fatar-/ we can account for the accent in both Sg
and PI forms. In Sg t-a-ftaq-q from /t-a-fatar-t/, the accented schwa is deleted
by Syncope, and the unattached accent then reattaches on the first syllable to
the left. No such phonological analysis will account for the accents in Sg
t-a-haela, PI t-i-hall.
Secondly, while PI t-i-fattar clearly shows T-c2, gemination of C2, in PI
t-i-hall it is best to recognize a gemination formative Γ-f, i.e. gemination of
the stem-final C. In t-i-hall itself, ""C2"" and ""stem-final C"" converge on the 1,
but there are at least three stems of the Sg shape t-a/e-CaePuQ-t that have a PI
t-i-CPaQQ, where C2 (i.e. P) is unaffected and gemination applies specifically
to the third and final stem C (Q). An example is Sg t-e-faetel-t 'lamp', PI
t-i-ftall. Other plurals of this type are t - i - d b a y y 'towns' and t-i-mdall
'sandstorms'(206.c) (§4.1.2.24.","[127, 128]"
"Some singular nouns already begin in a short vowel ae or a, whether it is
segmentable as a prefix or part of the stem. MaSg examples: addinaet 'people'
(dialectally seddinaet), ae-lawi 'cockiness'. Such nouns undergo no further
reduction after prepositions or in postverbal subject function. The same is true
of FeSg nouns with t- plus a short vowel, e.g. t-a-rlali-t-t 'women's cry of
joy'. Likewise, the few C-initial nouns that do not take nominal prefixes (e.g.
ksemmo 'illness') undergo no change in the syntactic positions indicated. For
all of these invariant nouns, there is no audible difference between e.g. subject
and object directly following a verb stem.
However, the majority of nouns do begin with a full-V prefix (with or
without FeSg t-). These undergo Prefix Reduction in the relevant positions:
MaSg α-kaebor 'sparrow', dependent ""ae-kaebor, MaPl ί-kbar, dependent
""a-kbar ; FeSg t-a-käebar-t, dependent ""t-se-kaebar-t, FePl t - l - k a b r - e n ,
dependent ""t-s-kabr-en varying dialectally with 't-0-kabr-en (with phrasal
accent on the preceding morpheme x).
The choice between ""a- and nas- here is consistent with an initial reduction
to ""ae-, which is then subject (most systematically in T-ka) to Short-V
Harmony (46) (§3.2.6), which converts /ae/ to a when the following syllable
has a high V. In dialects like A-grm that do not apply Short-V Harmony, we
get ""ae- as the reduced form of Ί α- or 'e- regardless of the vocalism of the
following syllable.
The choice between ""a- and zero (-0-) in the plural is somewhat tricky. In
all dialects, we get a phonetic schwa when the following stem begins with a
CC cluster, as in i-hrühuv-asn 'migrations', reduced form ""a-hrühur-aen. In
T-ka and some Gao-area dialects, if the stem proper begins with CV..., we get
""0- in the MaPl (for i-), but ""t-a- with a clear schwa in the FePl (for t-i-). In3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes149T-md, R, K, and some Gao-area dialects, we get ""0- in the MaPl (for i-) as in
T-ka, but also get 't-0- in the FePl. The dialectal difference can be seen in the
PP formed by Locative daer 'in' and the PI noun t-l-rubba 'gulps', which
appears as T-ka daer ""t-a-vubba but e.g. T-md d s r ""t-0-Yubba. Note the
accents; the T-ka schwa is capable of taking accent (here, default accent on the
antepenult), but the T-md zero is disregarded in accentuation, so phrasal accent
falls on the preceding preposition. A further example is t-l-hatt-en 'sheep-PI',
daer t-3-hatt-en 'in the sheep' (T-ka, some Gao-area dialects) or dser
t-0-hatt-en (K, other Gao-area dialects).
There is a real question whether the basic Prefix Reduction rule converts
PI i- to V (which can then be syncopated in some environments), or to 0 (with a schwa inserted by a later rule if too many C's have piled up). Within
T-ka, MaPl i- seems to have a basic reduced form '0-, but FePl t-i- has a basic
reduced form """"t-a-. so the MaPl and FePl diverge in vocalism. In T-md and
other dialects that allow FePl t-0-, it is reasonable to take ^0- as the basic
reduced form of PI Ί- in both MaPl and FePl
I will agonize about this no further, and will formulate the PrefixReduction rule as (127), allowing some latitude in the plural.
(127)Prefix-Reduction (Nominal Prefixes in Dependent State)
In a ""dependent"" syntactic position (after preposition, some types of
compound final, postverbal subject), reduce full to short V in
nominal vocalic prefix, i.e.:
a.{-a--e-} —>-ae-b.-i- —> -3- or - 0 - [see above for details]1503 PhonologyFor those nouns that undergo no audible change in Prefix Reduction
contexts (i.e. those with no vocalic prefix and those with a short-voweled
prefix), there are occasional parsing difficulties at the sentential level. The two
sentences in (128.a-b) are identical in form but have different senses.

various early rules and <H L> melody
Stem-Initial Syncope
Leftward L-Spreading
surface formBecause Melodic Association for perfective verbs produces sequences of
the maximal type «HHLLL», there are never more than two Η-vowel syllables
at the beginning of the stem. In all relevant cases, the perfective stem begins
with a nonlexical initial short V, the first schwa of /axababae-t/, which is
therefore followed by no more than one other schwa-syllable before the
melody switches from Η to L. Stem-Initial Syncope deletes this second schwa,
giving /axbabas-t/. It remains merely to change the initial /a/ to as. If we
allowed Short-V Harmony to work in a symmetrical fashion, we could
attribute the initial ae of -aexbabae-t to this harmony rule. However, sequences
like aCCa are stable in other contexts, including perfectives of -vCCu- verbs
like -aksa- 'eat', so I have elsewhere expressed doubts about a symmetrical
formulation of Short-V Harmony (§3.2.6). As a result, I recognize Leftward
L-Spreading as a morphologically sprecialized rule converting the initial /a/ to
ae in (95).
There are some alternative options, especially for dialects other than T-ka.
In T-ka, the maximal melody for perfectives is «HHLLL», and there is no
reason to consider an alternative «LHLLL» which would unproblematically
become «LLLL» after Stem-Initial Syncope (deleting the Η vowel). However,
in the dialects other than T-ka and A-grm, it is much more reasonable to allow
«LHLLL» as a maximal melody for perfectives. In particular, in these dialects
(K-d, R, T-md), we get surface «LHLLL» when the Η syllable is full, i.e. i or
u. This applies even to verbs like -xvbubu- (+ -t), namely in the Resit stem,
which appears as -axlbabas-t in T-Ka but as -aexlbabae-t in the other dialects
mentioned. In these non-T-ka dialects, it may be best to formulate Stem-Initial
V-Insertion (see below) so that the added stem-initial V is specified as as. This
would actually work for T-ka as well, since Short-V Harmony would convert
/ae/ to a under the influence of the Η vowel of the following syllable. However,
in T-ka there is no direct evidence for initial /as/ in these perfectives, and since
«HHLLL» is a reasonable mapping of <H L> onto perfective verb stems I am
inclined to have Stem-Initial V-Insertion just insert an unspecified short V in
T-ka.
There is an intriguing similarity between Leftward L-Spreading in (95) on
the one hand, and a dialectal alternation of the type -aPaQ- versus -aePQ- in
the short imperfective (including Imprt). Examples: Future ad t-awat 'she will
hit' versus, depending on dialect, ad awat-aer (e.g. T-ka) or ad aewt-aer (e.g.
K-d) Ί will hit'. The variants of type -aewt- occur chiefly in the Kidal area
((49), §3.2.6.2). These variants show the same pattern suggested in the3.4 Ablaut123derivation (95), namely syncope of a second-syllable schwa accompanied by
switch of a stem-initial schwa to ae. However, to my knowledge, T-ka does not
show this output type in short imperfectives: ad awst-aer Ί will hit'.
In A-grm, Stem-Initial Syncope does not apply to the perfectives in (94),
but we get stem-wide <L> vocalism anyway. Thus -xaebabae-t, -taerara-,
-s-aemm-askae-t, -s-aennaem-aehael-, and so forth. In A-grm, therefore, there is
no connection between Leftward L-Spreading and Syncope, since the
spreading rule applies in the absence of Syncope. I will not venture here into
the question whether A-grm preserves an archaic, Proto-Tuareg system, or has
recently reshaped the perfectives (ultimately on the model of the Imprt, e.g.
xsbubs-t, tsrur).
Aside from the cases where (outside of A-grm) Stem-Initial Syncope and
Leftward L-Spreading are correlated, there are a few nonsyncopating verb
types that have stem-wide <L> melody in the perfective. These are light stems
beginning with a full V (-uCu-, -uCvC-, -uCCi>, etc.), and middleweight
stems of shape -CuCvC- with a full V after the first C. An example is in (96).
(96)Perfective Verb (Surface <L> Melody, no Syncope)
lexical formPerfPgloss-dubvn--aedobaen-'marry'This perfective has a medial mid-height V, here o. See §3.4.7, just below,
for more data, and an analysis involving V-Height Compromise. The initial ae
(instead of a) in the PerfP forms of 'marry', 'be open', and 'be held in
common' suggest that the <L> melody is stem-wide.
I see no reasonable way to integrate the perfective melody seen in (96)
with the surface <L> melody described above for verbs subject to Stem-Initial
Syncope. Historically, it is possible that the tripartite perfective <L Η L>
melody seen in non-T-ka dialects in perfectives whose second V is a full high
V, as in Resit -aexibabae-t '(hole) gape' with vocalic sequence «LHLL», is
archaic. Using ""M"" for mid-height V, the surface bisyllabic trisyllabic «LML»
vocalic sequences seen in -aedobaen- (96) might be an additional vestige of a
tripartite <L Η L> melody.","[140, 141, 142]"

ablaut changeIn (8.a), a morphophonological rule Prefix Reduction (e.g. -a- reduced to
-as-, or -i- reduced to -a-) applies to nouns in combinations with specific
preceding forms. Of special interest is the fact that reduction applies to the122 Overviewverb-subject sequence, but not to a verb-object sequence. For more on the
role this plays in ""case marking,"" see §2.3, below.
For verbs, the only true local dependency is that of an inflected verb on a
preceding Negative (8.b). This applies in all combinations where no elements
(other than floating clitics) intervene between the two, hence to perfective,
(long) imperfective, and imperative (i.e. prohibitive) stems. Basically the
modification converting Y to Y' adds phonetic content (where it is not
vacuous) in the perfective, reduces phonetic content (erasing a V-length ablaut
formative χ-pcl and an accent ablaut formative χ-pcl) in the imperfective and
prohibitive, and modifies the stem vocalism in all of these stems.
The cases in (8.c) are limited to definite relative clauses, which begin
with a definite demonstrative (in apposition to the head NP, which if overtly
expressed is external to the clause). The modification in ablaut form of the
verb involves erasure of a V-length ablaut formative (χ-pcl), and (with
specific exceptions) a shift in the location of the ablaut accent formative (in
one combination, this formative is entirely erased). The formulation of the
relevant rules requires an extraordinary interpenetration of ""syntax"" and
""phonology,"" and constitutes an important empirical argument against highly
modularized theories of grammar.
It is possible to combine two [X Y'...] configurations, as in the
combination [Negative verb noun(subject) ...]. In this combination, the
relevant pairs involving local dependencies are [Negative verb] and [verb
noun(subject)]. As a result, internal bracketing as in [Negative [verb
noun(subject)] ...] or [[Negative verb] noun(subject) ...] is counterproductive
(any such bracketing would appear to separate two forms that enter into a local
dependency). The only points that matter are adjacency (disregarding clitics)
and the grammatical relationship (e.g. Negative + verb, or verb +
noun(subject).

morphological connection to the prohibitive). The positive imperative is
clause-initial (hence is preceded by no ""X"" element), and it lacks the usual

-onaen-, Shlmpf -anan-, Lolmpf -t-lnan-. The unusual feature in the causative
is the disconnect in vocalism between the perfectives, which can be easily
derived from -s-unvn- with u, and the imperfectives and VblN, which are
based on -s-invn- with i. Since the VblN is the best diagnostic for basic lexical
form, the perfectives are the odd man out, and suggest a morphological bias in
causatives toward u rather than i as input, hence output ο rather than e.
Compare underived -CuCvC-, where -CiCvC- is somewhat less common than
-CuCvC- but is nonetheless clearly attested (§7.3.1.7). The alternation of o, i,
and α in the first syllable of the forms for 'break in' is typical of stems with a
basic shape /(a)Ci.../ in the Shlmpf and VblN. Other examples are -s-ilvl'cause to be lodged' with Imprt s-ilal, and -z-ihvz- 'make approach' with
Imprt z-lhaz.
For 'make detest' the underlying verb is (PerfP) -okaed- 'detest'. The
double-prefix type may be typical of causatives of transitive input verbs,
though data are sparse. In addition to 'make detest' I can cite -s-vs-ikvy- 'pass
by', Imprt s-ass-ikay.
In the single-prefix type, perfective variants with e instead of ο are rare
in T-ka, but are more common in other dialects. The verbs in (457.a) have e
even in T-ka, probably by dissimilation to w (compare §4.1.2.17). In
(457.b-e) we see the dialect split between perfective ο (generally T-ka) and e,8.1 Causative451not involving w. The verb 'break in' in (457.e), cf. (456), also has a variant
with α recorded from a T-md speaker, perhaps erroneous (this vocalism is
typical of double causatives).

-v(C)CuC- . These stems have a variably short or full V in the first syllable, a
full V in the second syllable, and a final C. Since these verbs have rather
distinct perfective and imperfective systems, the question arises whether the
causative is based on the perfective or the imperfective. This is not a
meaningful issue for other verb classes, whose perfective and (short)
imperfective stems differ only in vocalic melody.
The underived -i/uC(C)aC- verbs normally have an initial schwa in the
perfective forms versus a full V in the imperfectives, e.g. 'pray' with PerfP
-amud- (dialectally -aemud-) versus Shlmpf -ümad- (Imprt u m a d , LoImpfP
- t - ü m a d - ) . Moreover, there are some verbs whose perfective shows
consonantal gemination not seen in imperfectives, though there is dialectal
variation in this respect; an example is 'be hot': PerfP -akkus-, Shlmpf -Ikas(dialectally -ükas-). Given these stem differences, it should be possible (for
this verb class) to decide whether the perfective or the imperfective of the
underived stem is the basis for the causative.

3.2.7.1Syncope and Leftward L-Spreading
SyncopeIn some positions, a Syncope rule affecting /a/, and arguably /ae/, appears to
apply. Whether or not the rule affects only /a/ (asymmetrical version) or
applies equally to both /a/ and /ae/ (symmetrical version) depends on decisions
about how to represent the stems in question. The data just below on Syncope
are for T-ka, while some dialectological color is given at the end of this
section.
The most important cases of Stem-Initial Syncope involve alternations of
stem-initial surface -CvCV... and -vCCV... in verbs, where ""v"" is a short
vowel and ""V"" is any vowel. Consider the examples in (51).

-sexbabae-t
ά-xbubucategory
Shlmpf
PerfP
VblNWithin the set of pronominally inflectable verb forms, the unsyncopated
onset is confined to the Imprt forms, which are always unprefixed. On the
other hand, we find Syncope at work in all of the fully-inflectable (i.e. prefixtolerant) stems such as Shlmpf and PerfP, which begin with a short V absent
from the Imprt, due to Stem-Initial V-Insertion (99). This initial short V is also
found in other verbs that geminate the initial C and therefore are not subject to
syncope, converting e.g. PvQR... to vPPvQR... (§3.4.8). (51) also shows that
Syncope operates in the VblN, targeting a short V in the first stem syllable,
which follows the vocalic prefix, here a-.
There is no Stem-Initial Syncope when the basic form of the stem is of the
middleweight shape -CvCvC- (with only short V's). This is the shortest of the
heavy verb-stem shapes (§3.4.1.4) that begins with a short open syllable of the
sort that could, in principle, be syncopated. The absence of Stem-Initial
Syncope is seen in VblN's of the form α-CaCaC (or its variant a-CaCaC), e.g.
a-baraj (or more common variant a-baraj, subject to possible reinterpretation
as a-baeraj) 'boasting, boastfulness'. Likewise, causative Shlmpf stems like
-s-araf- 'pester' with subject prefix, e.g. 3MaSg Future ad V s - a r a f 'he will
not pester', fail to syncopate. There are also some nouns like t - a - b a k u n - t
'heap' with unsyncopated a. The stem (minus the vocalic prefix) is again743 Phonologybisyllabic. However, I did record a syncopated suffixal PI t-i-bkun-en
(alongside ablaut PI t-i-bakkan).
In cases like VblN ά-xbubu, note that the accent is on the surface
antepenult. However, this does not necessarily mean that Default Accentuation
applies only to the output of Stem-Initial Syncope. We can get the correct
output either by having Default Accentuation apply last, or by having it apply
first but adding a rule that accent is reassigned to the next syllable on the left
when the accented V is deleted (by Stem-Initial Syncope). This latter
interpretation would have a stage /a-xabubu/ in the derivation that ends up as
ά-xbubu (compare A-grm a-xabubi).
Assuming a Stem-Initial Syncope rule in the forms on the right in (51), the
deleted short V is clearly hi in Shlmpf -sxbuba-t (from /-axabuba-t/) and in
VblN ά-xbubu (from /a-xabubu/). This is based on the prevailing <H> vocalic
melodies for Shlmpf stems and VblN's for stems of this general shape. Let us
see if the other cases of Syncope can be analysed in such a way that the
syncopated V is hi rather than /ae/, so that an asymmetrical Syncope rule can
be posited.
The obvious problem with this is that Stem-Initial Syncope also applies to
PerfP -aexbabae-t, which appears to have a uniform <L> melody. The most
straightforward derivation would be from /-aexaebabae-t/ with stem-wide <L>
melody. This would force us to adopt a symmetrical version of Stem-Initial
Syncope, applying to /ae/ as well as hi. However, there is an alternative
analysis where -aexbabae-t is instead derived from /-axababae-t/, first
syncopating to /-axbabas-t/ before surfacing (after Leftward L-Spreading, see
below) as -sxbabas-t by Short-V Harmony. In this case, we could argue that
Syncope applies specifically to hi.
The first part of the argument for this analysis is as follows. In the
perfective family of stems (and disregarding the unprefixed perfectives,
probably of nominal origin, of adjectival verbs), the surface melodies are either
of the type <L>, as in -aexbabae-t, or <H L>, the latter expressed as surface
vocalic sequence «HL», «HHL», «HHLL», etc., depending on the number of
stem syllables. The stem-wide perfective <L> melody occurs precisely in those
verbs that also show Syncope, while non-syncopating verbs have the
composite perfective melody <H L>. We should therefore consider the
possibility that the stem-wide <L> perfective melody is reducible to an
underlying <H L>, which would permit us to position a schwa in the
syncopation site.
Second, in deverbal nominals of verbs, and in some nominal Sg/Pl
alternations, there is evidence that a syncopates while ae does not. For
example, the same verb xvbubu- (+ -t) seen in (51) above is related to a noun
t-ae-xaebabu-t-t 'gaping hole'. The first two syllables of the stem have L
vocalism, so we get ae rather than a after x. Whereas s in VblN /a-xabubu/
syncopates, giving ά-xbubu, the ae between χ and b in t-ae-xasbabu-t-t fails to
syncopate. Many verbs have pairs of formally similar VblN's with stem-wide
<H> stem melody and a related noun (often agentive in sense, beginning with3.2 Local assimilations and syllabification rules75<L ...> melody), showing the same association of Syncope with a while ae fails
to syncopate (§8.11.1).
In addition, the plural of t-s-xaebabu-t-t 'gaping hole' is t-l-xbuba. The PI
is syncopated from /t-i-xabuba/, assuming the standard <H L> melody of
unsuffixed ablaut plurals. There are many similar Sg/Pl plurals with
unsyncopated ae in the Sg and Syncope (presumably of /a/) in the PI, e.g. Sg
α-baetol 'ground depression' and PI ί-btal (from /i-batal/), and ae-raerdrad
'thick-knee (bird)' and PI i-rrurad. Note also a-nasbaj 'hole', irregular variant
PI l - m b u j j a (with extra gemination and final V). Note that Syncope is not
blocked by accent in /i-bstal/; when the schwa syncopates, the accent simply
reattaches to the syllable to its left. There are also some suggestive alternations
among minor nominal ablaut patterns, where a appears to syncopate while as
does not, e.g. t-a-blülaeq-q and virtually synonymous t-ae-baelalaq-q 'ball,
lump' (cf. Imprt verb balular 'be ball-shaped').
We therefore have considerable evidence for an asymmetrical version of
Syncope that applies to a but not to as. This evidence comes from nominal
plurals, and from contrasts between VblN and L-initial nominalizations of
verbs. In this light, it is not unreasonable to take another look at syncopated
perfective verb stems like -aexbabas-t. In particular, we could argue that StemInitial Syncope applies at a stage where the first two V ' s are schwas
(/-axababae-t/). This has the advantage of reconciling the apparent stem-wide
<L> melody of this perfective type with the prevailing <H L> perfective
melody. The latter results in surface «HHLL» with quadrisyllable stems like
-fuffvru- (PerfP -affuffaerae-t) 'scrub', and «HHLL» is precisely the vocalism
of the assumed underlying /-axababas-t/, since schwa is Η while {a ae} are L.
The idea, then, is to allow e.g. /-axababae-t/ to syncopate to /-axbabas-t/. To
account for surface -aexbabae-t, a further rule is needed to spread the L part of
the <H L> melody to the left edge of the stem, resulting in an apparent stemwide <L> melody. On this spreading, see §3.2.7.2, below.
Stem-Initial Syncope applies most productively to CvC syllables when
preceded and followed by V's, but even here the rule is somewhat specialized.
As a productive rule, Stem-Initial Syncope is confined to superheavy stems
(§3.4.1.4) whose basic form is at least trisyllabic, e.g. to -CvCvC(C)vC-. It
applies to the ""middleweight"" (though still ""heavy"" for some purposes) stem
type -CvCvC- only in certain morphological contexts. The set of these
contexts, showing Syncope even with middleweight -CvCvC- stems, is given
in (52), followed by the set of contexts limited to superheavy stems in (53).
The syncopated V ' s are taken here to be /a/ in all cases, adopting the
suggestion made above. As usual, ""V"" = any vowel (full or short), ""v"" = short
vowel. All of the contexts involve a prefix or (for certain verbs) an extra initial
short V due to Stem-Initial V-Insertion. Accents are shown in the general
formulae only when applicable to all examples, otherwise omitted.","[92, 93, 94]"

are absent. For K(K-f and optionally K-d), I recorded 3MaPl affuffari-n. This
is phonologically straightforward, assuming basic form -fiiffvru-, Shlmpf <H>
melody, and /i-se/ contracting to i (parallel to /u-ae/ contracting to u in T-ka).
However, for I and R dialects (and optionally for K-d), I recorded forms with e
instead of i, hence 3MaPl Shlmpf abbuffe-n and affuffare-n. These Shlmpf
forms have an odd resemblance to the corresponding perfectives, where stemfinal /a/ contracts with suffixal /as/ to give e, as in 3MaPl PerfP aebbuffe-n
'they were abundant' in these same dialects. It would seem that the e in the
Shlmpf forms in these dialects is due to an unusual analogy from perfective to
Shlmpf, and I will not attempt to derive these forms phonologically.
I now turn to stems where the full V occurs in a noninitial open syllable
in the basic representation. The stems in question have the shapes -CvCuCu-,
-CvCCuCu- just (one attested unaugmented verb, see (406) later in this
section, and -CVCVCCUCD-. These stems have <L> melodies in the perfective,
and except for the rare -CvCCuCu- stem shape they have a lexically
determined high V (u or i) in the imperfectives and in the VblN. I consider the
high V to be part of the basic representation.
Verbs of the shapes -CvCuCu- and -CVCVCCUCD- with lexical u are
