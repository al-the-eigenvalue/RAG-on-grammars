3.4.1 Yes/No questions
As stated in 3.2.3.2, the order of words in a question requiring an eye ‗yes‘ or chuli ‗no‘ answer is the same as
the order of the words in a statement. In conversation, a question is distinguished from a statement by
intonation. In writing, a question is distinguished from a statement by punctuation (question marks).
Example¿Pe mas tune?",[41]
"4.2 Pronunciation
4.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2)
In section 3.2.3 the intonation pattern of questions requiring yes/no answers is discussed. Other types of
questions are discussed in this lesson (see 4.4.3 for grammatical explanations). Become familiar with the correct
intonation of questions by doing the following exercises.15Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 4.1 by humming the intonation. Pay special attention to acknowledgement of the
answer to a question.",[46]
"Exercise 4. Answer intonation drill
The teacher says Dialogue 3.1 and the student reads the dialogue, humming the intonation quietly as the teacher
reads aloud. Pay special attention to the intonation and pitch of the answers.
3.2.3.2 Intonation pattern of questions
A question has a different intonation pattern from a statement. The actual order of words in a question which requires
a yes/no answer is the same order as for a statement. Because the word order does not vary, it is important that you
learn the intonation patterns for questions versus statements in order to distinguish a question from an answer.
In Kuna, the pitch at which the question is said is higher than the pitch of a statement. The last word of a
question is even higher pitch than the rest of the question and then the pitch of that word falls off quickly.",[38]
"‗Peter, I would like it if you would give me the medicine.‘3) Questioning request
When the speaker is not sure whether or not the listener can meet a request, he uses a questioning request.
This construction is formed by using the word wis ‗a little‘ with the suffix -ji following the future suffix.
A question intonation pattern is used (see 3.2.3). The use of -ji expects a positive (yes) answer.
Example¿An wis pentakoji?",[213]

The teacher gives the stimulus in the form of a yes/no question. The student replies using the correct form of the
completive aspect suffix. This exercise should be repeated several times.
ExampleTeacher: ¿Ome sabured pakne?
Student: Chuli. Pato mol pakcha.
Frame Chuli. Pato mol ____.
‗No, (she) already ____ a blouse.‘
1. ¿Ome sabured pakne?
‗Is the woman going to buy the skirt?‘

7. ¿Ome sabured ukne?
‗Is the woman going to sell the skirt?‘
8. ¿Ome sabured amine?
‗Is the woman going to look for the skirt?‘4.4.3 Content Questions (Ex. 11–18)
Content questions are questions which require something other than yes/no answers (see 3.2.3.2). The
information required is signalled in English by a question word such as ―Who?,‖ ―What?,‖ ―When?,‖ etc. In
Kuna, there are three types of content questions: amplificatory questions, topic-establishing questions, and
confirmation questions.
4.4.3.1 Amplificatory questions
Amplificatory questions are asked about a topic that may be already under discussion, or so obvious that it
requires no introduction. Most of the time, more information is being sought about the action referred to in the
discussion at hand. For example, the questioner may want to know who did the action, or when the action
happened. In dealing with amplificatory questions, two things must be remembered: the intonation pattern of
the question and the formation of the question.","[51, 52]"
"1) Forms of the basic negative word chuli „no‟
When used alone, the basic negative word chuli ‗no‘ may occur in one of three forms:
a) Chul ‗no‘
Chul ‗no‘ is the most common form of the basic negative word. It is used in response to a question which
requires a negative answer. In other words, it is used to deny that the action in the question is going to take
place.",[217]
"11.4.8 Obligatory answers to questions and proposals
Kuna tends to be more explicit than English/Spanish. A real question must be answered or a proposal responded
to by the listener before he can pose a counter question or counter proposal. The listener, however, is allowed to
ask for further information or clarification before answering the main question or proposal.
Example
1. Speaker A:
2. Speaker B:
3. Speaker A:
4. Speaker B:¿Inkwa pe nao?
¿Piaje?
Negzhe.
Pane.",[152]
"Exercise 5. Yes/no question intonation drill
Mimic the intonation of the teacher by humming the the intonation of the following questions.
1. ¿Pe mas chikne?
2. ¿Pe mol pakne?
3. ¿Pe ogob tigne?
4. ¿Pe ua tune?
5. ¿Machi ob kunne?
6. ¿Machi chowal chikne?",[38]
"‗(Explaining) I‘m going to tell you a story.‘4) jáj
Although jáj ‗challenge‘ is often used to make a real question (one that expects an answer) into a
rhetorical question (one that doesn‘t expect an answer), in a wider sense, it is used to challenge the listener
to dispute or contradict what he has said.
Example¿Inkwa pe takcha, jáj?",[299]
"1) Answer to a question
In Kuna, when an answer to a question includes a group of participants, the construction is handled by
giving the name of one participant, the name of the other participant, the number of participants, and the
verb: participant + participant + number of participants + verb.
Example
Juan, María; walbo nad.",[133]
"‗The chief will arrive tomorrow. If not, then the day
after tomorrow.‘20.4.11.3 Alternative choice
When a speaker is deciding on a choice of two actions or people, the choice is indicated by two questions; the
first poses the choice involved with or without -dewa/-tewa, the second states the two alternatives each
accompanied by -dewa/-tewa ‗perhaps‘.
Examples
1a. ¿Igi an chao?
b. ¿An naodewa (o) chuldewa?
2a. ¿Toa an palmine(dewa)?
b. ¿Pedrodewa (o) Pablodewa?
3a. ¿Mol igid an pako?
b. Antin mol kinnid paknedewa (o) mol
kollogwaddewa.",[297]
"‗Whose (is it)?‘
‗To what (does it belong?‘13.4.2.5 Extended use of -gad/-kad
-gad/-kad is used in the sense of ‗made of some type of material‘.
Examples
1. chowalgad
2. ezhagad‗wooden‘
‗made of iron‘Exercise 4. -gadi/-kadi drill
The teacher asks the question and the student answers the question, selecting an answer from the list below.
ExampleTeacher: ¿Achude, toagadi?
Student: Angadi.
Answers
1. an
‗I‘
2. mu
‗older respected lady‘64The variation in word order in which the possessive -gad/-kad form precedes the noun indicates that the focus is on the
possessive word. For example, Ankad ul cheles. ‗(It was) my canoe that was washed away.‘ but Ul ankad cheles. ‗My
canoe was washed away.‘162Communicating Community Togetherness3. pab

"12.4 Grammar147Answers to questions
Time expressions used to answer time-related questions such as: ¿Inkwa? ‗When?‘ occur at the beginning
of the sentence.
Examples
1. ¿Inkwa pe ne?
2. Pan an ne.","[159, 160]"
"2) Eg
Eg ‗and/in addition to‘ is used in hesitating as you count money (see 7.4.1.3). It can also be used to
hold-the-floor, for example, when you say, ―In addition (eg) ...‖
11.4.5 Yielding-the-floor
There are times in the conversation when a change of speaker is permitted. By using a yielding-the-floor
expression, the speaker indicates it is now polite for someone else to speak. At other times, an interjection by
another speaker is an interruption. As in any other language, Kuna has ways of signalling the accepted times to
change speakers.
11.4.5.1 Yielding-the-floor questions
One of the most common signals and one which clearly signals that the floor is now free for another speaker, is
the use of a question.
One situation, however, in which a question does not indicate a yielding of the floor is the case of rhetorical
questions used for rebuke. The speaker does not want the listener to answer a rhetorical question. This type of
question is clearly marked by jaj which is added to the end of the question.
Example
Angry father to his son:
¿Pe es chapurbal ebes? ¿Jaj?",[147]

‗____ cut (it)?‘4.4.3.2 Topic-establishing questions
The topic of a question is the person or thing to whom/which the question refers. It is very important in Kuna
that the topic of a question be clear. If the person or thing to whom/which the question refers is not presently
being talked about, or if the topic is not obvious, it must be stated before the question itself. If the topic of a
question is obscure and it is not stated, the listener may not understand the question.
For example, if you suddenly ask, ―Where is he going?,‖ your listener will invariably reply, ―Where is who
going?‖ By asking this question, the listener has tried to establish the topic of your question. In other words, the
topic of the question was unclear. Once the listener has understood the topic, he will answer the question. Three
things must be kept in mind in using topic-establishing questions: the intonation pattern of the question, the
order of the sentence, and the form of the topic.","[53, 54]"
"1) Subject omitted from simple sentence and stated in postpredicate position in answer to question
One situation in which the subject is omitted in the main part of the sentence and stated in the
postpredicate position is in answer to a question. If the replier wishes to emphasize the subject as he
replies to a question, he may do so by omitting it in the main part of the sentence and stating it,
accompanied by the suffix -din/-tin, in the postpredicate position.
Examples
1a. ¿Pia pe ne?
b. Chapurbal ne; antin.
2a. ¿Piade?
b. Nad; Luisdin.",[262]
"4.3 Culture
In Kuna, if someone answers a question you have asked, it is polite to acknowledge the answer before you ask
another question. Such expressions as ajáj, aaaa, eye ‗yes‘, are used to acknowledge the answer to a question
(see 11.4.3.1).
Most Kunas have a Spanish name and a Kuna name; they prefer to use their Spanish names with outsiders and
for doing business. If you are referring to a Kuna while you are in conversation with someone, or if you need to
attract the attention of a Kuna, it is more polite to refer to him by his role in society (e.g., sagla ‗chief‘) or by his
kinship to someone (e.g., Luis pab ‗Louis‘ father‘, Alvaro machi ‗Alvaro‘s son‘), than directly by name. It is
not polite to ask someone his Kuna name. Even if you know an individual‘s Kuna name, you should use his
Spanish name to refer to him. Only if/when in conversation with you, the Kuna people refer to someone by his
Kuna name, are you at liberty to use his Kuna name.",[50]
"‗Where did father go?‘
‗I am going.‘3) Emphatic answers
Emphatic, single word answers to questions occur in the long form.

In addition to content questions discussed in Section 4.4.3, there is a color question. A color question is used to
inquire about the color of an object and is formed by the use of the word ¿Igid? ‗What color (is it)?‘
Examples
1. ¿Molde, igid?
2. ¿Ulde, igid?
3. ¿Mol igid?","[122, 123]"

The teacher says one of the sentences above. The student has to identify whether the teacher has uttered a
question or a statement and writes ―question‖ or ―statement‖ on his answer sheet.
ExamplesTeacher (says):

"‗A machete of mine is in the house.‘

‗What?‘
‗Where could it (possibly) be?‘
‗When could it (possibly) happen?‘
‗What‘s wrong? (Lit.: What possibly?)‘20.4.11 Alternatives
The stating of alternatives in Kuna is complex: both of the alternatives are stated. Several ways are used to
express alternatives.
20.4.11.1 Alternatives in postpredicate position
A main sentence, either a statement or question, which gives rise to the alternatives is stated with the
probability/possibility suffix -dewa/-tewa attached to the verb. The two alternatives with the suffix
-dewa/-tewa ‗perhaps‘ attached to each one, are stated in the postpredicate position. When the alternative is
more remote the suffix -dowa/-towa is used.
Examples
1. Antin wichul inkwa tanidewa; pandewa
(o)128 achuldewa.
127‗I do not know when (he) is coming perhaps; perhaps
tomorrow (or) perhaps the day after tomorrow.‘The suffix -dibe/-tibe ‗perhaps‘ is used rarely in the Paya Kuna dialect although it is common in the San Blas dialect. It
is limited to already hypothetical situations. For example, ¿Ibi an immal kaotibeye? ‗How could I perhaps catch
something?‘ (see #13 of Section 20.1).
128
The Spanish o ‗or‘ has been borrowed into the language and is used often between alternatives.",[296]

Note: The lenis consonant r does not occur at the beginning of words.
3.2.5 Pronunciation of monosyllabic words (Ex. 11)
Monosyllabic words are words which have only one syllable. Kuna words which are made up of only one vowel
and one consonant, or of only one vowel are pronounced by lengthening the vowel. When such monosyllabic
words are said in isolation or at the end of a sentence, the tone slides down (down glides).
Examples
1. ti
2. an
3. u‗water‘
‗branch‘
‗nest‘Exercise 11. Pronunciation of monosyllabic words
The teacher says a word from the list below, and the student repeats the word after the teacher, mimicking as
closely as possible the down glide in these monosyllabic words.

When people first meet, there is usually an exchange of questions which helps the people become acquainted.
Cultures differ as to the questions which may be politely asked in such a situation.
Questions about where you have come from and where you are going are quite acceptable in Kuna. The
question, ―When are you leaving?‖ is also often asked. That question does not have the same negative
connotation it does in English, but rather implies the idea of, ―How long are you staying?‖ Questions
concerning your parents, brothers and sisters, and wife/husband and children are bound to follow.","[39, 40]"

Structurally, confirmation questions are the same as the amplificatory questions. However, their purpose is
different. A confirmation question acknowledges that the narrator has already given the information asked for
by the listener. The listener has missed the information for some reason or another, so he asks for a repeat. The
confirmation question is signalled by a distinctive intonation pattern. The question basically says: ―I know you
already said this, but would you please say it again?‖ Do the following exercise to familiarize yourself with the
intonation pattern.","[55, 56]"
"Exercise 9. Question and statement contrast
The student should listen while the teacher repeats Sentences 1–5 in Exercise 6 above. The teacher then inserts

"Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in the above dialogue, formulating the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1)
slowing down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.
3.2.2 Pronunciation of consonant cluster with lenis consonant g or fortis consonant k before
nasals m and n (Ex. 3)
The nasals m and n following a lenis consonant g do not change the quality of the g, The g is still said in a
relaxed, soft manner and the preceding vowel is lengthened.
Examples10chig + -ne = chigne
tig + -mal = tigmal‗going to sit‘
‗(they) plant‘oi is pronounced like oy in ‗boy‘ in English or like ‗hoy‘ ‗today‘ in Spanish. Igi ‗how‘ is contracted to ig in this greeting.
243.2 Pronunciation25The nasals m and n following a fortis consonant k, however, change the quality of the k. The k remains a fortis
sound but is pronounced as a hard g sound. The hard g sound is used in the English word ‗bigness‘ and in the
Spanish word gorra ‗cap‘. In the case of a consonant cluster of k before nasals m and n, the vowel preceding
the cluster is short. In this way the identity of the fortis k is clarified.
Exampleschik + -ne = chikne
pak + -mal = pakmal‗going to cut‘
‗(they) buy‘Exercise 3. Pronunciation of consonant cluster lenis g or fortis k and nasals m or n
The teacher reads through the list of words aloud while the student reads the words silently. The teacher reads
each word and the student mimics the teacher, being careful to pronounce as closely as possible the lenis g and
fortis k before the nasals m and n.
ExampleTeacher: chikne
Student: chikne
1. chikne
‗going to cut‘
2. chigne
‗going to sit down‘
3. makne

4. magne

‗(they) sit (down)‘
7. makmal
‗(they) sew‘
8. magmal
‗(they) paint‘3.2.3 Intonation patterns of questions and answers (Ex. 4–10)
In Kuna, questions and answers have different intonation patterns.
3.4.2.2 Intonation pattern of answers
As you get into the Kuna language and people try to get to know you, you will find that your early
conversations are primarily question and answer interactions. Both the questions and the answers in Kuna have
specific intonation patterns. For the purpose of these lessons, consider the normal pitch to be that of a statement.","[37, 38]"
"‗I am going to go.‘
‗I am going to go, too.‘10.4.2.2 Participants viewed as a group
At times, it is necessary to group the different participants together and treat them as if they had acted as a unit.
For example, ―John and Mary went.‖
There are at least two constructions for viewing participants as a group. Reference to participants as a group
usually occurs in answer to a question or in making a statement.",[133]
"206Commands1) Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) „no‟ negating a word
As discussed in Section 9.4.2, the negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) may be used to negate specific
words such as adjectives or adverbs. The basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) is added to an
adjective to give a negative answer to a question, to intensify antithesis or to provide an antonym for an
adjective which does not have an antonym.
Examples
1. totojuli
2. kakpijuli
3. tikalbal
becomes
tikajul‗not small (emphatic: large)‘
‗not at all bitter (sweet)‘
‗nearby‘
‗not near (far)‘2) Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) „no‟ negating a sentence
A Kuna sentence is negated by adding the basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) ‗no‘ to the verb.96
The long form has a more emphatic connotation than the short. The suffix is attached to the verb stem or
immediately following the aspect suffix, for example, the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi (see 2.4.2.1).
Examples
1. An immal pakchul.
2. An mol peichuli.97
3. An mol peichul.
4. An nan takchajul.
5. Anmal yannu gwen takchajulmal.
6. An nebijul.","[218, 219]"
"Exercise 18. Confirmation question drill
The teacher says Sentence 1a and then leads the class in asking the confirmation question 1b. The class repeats
the question after the teacher, being careful to mimic the intonation pattern. The teacher then replies to the

Then you learn to control what you have learned in other limited contexts. For example, you move from
controlling toa ‗who‘ only in amplificatory questions, to controlling toa ‗who‘ in topic questions and
confirmation questions though all in the limited context of questions.
Examples
1. ¿Toa koe makcha?
2. ¿Koede, toa tar makcha?
3. ¿Toa makcha?",[322]

being.

1. ¿Ibi nika?
2. ¿Igi ito?",[126]
"‗You who are here, how are you?‘
‗We are here, and we are fine.‘
‗You‘ve come?‘
‗Yes.‘
‗You‘ve arrived?‘
‗Yes.‘11.4.2 Establishment of topic (Ex. 4)
The topic of a conversation must be established. It is usually established by a question as discussed in Section
4.4.3.2. If the topic of the conversation is not implicit in the situation, the person who begins the conversation
must clearly set the topic or other people involved in the conversation will not know what is being discussed. A
topic-establishing question uses a specific intonation pattern, order of sentence, and also the long form of the
topic. Such suffixes as -din/-tin, -de/-te may be used to establish a topic, as discussed in Lesson III.D.5.",[145]

4.1 Dialogue
Question words are extremely useful in finding your way among strangers in a new place. When you have only
partial control of the language, you can question someone until you fully understand what they have been
saying. By fully using the question words—several of which are included in Dialogue 4.1—you can continue a
conversation for a reasonable time, even though you have very little control of the language. They also help the
language learner to become better acquainted with the language and culture.

"8.3CultureYou already know how important it is to exchange greetings when you encounter a Kuna in or around the
village. Failure to greet people you pass in a Kuna village in the Darién indicates lack of acceptance or
displeasure.
You will certainly experience times, however, when you will want to do more than just greet the person.
Perhaps you will wish to establish an acquaintance or start a conversation. In such situations the use of
questions is very helpful. Questions concerning the person‘s family (Are you married? Do you have
brothers/sisters? Do you have children?) are acceptable. Questions concerning birthplace, what he is doing,
where he is going or where he lives are also acceptable and are very good conversation openers.
You must be careful to avoid certain areas of conversation which a person would find threatening to his people
or himself. For instance, detailed questioning about tribal ceremonies and customs should be withheld until you
are sure you have established mutual respect with the person.",[100]

say sentences and trying to mimic them. Do the following exercises, listening carefully to the intonation
patterns of the questions and answers, and mimicking the intonation as closely as possible.",[37]
