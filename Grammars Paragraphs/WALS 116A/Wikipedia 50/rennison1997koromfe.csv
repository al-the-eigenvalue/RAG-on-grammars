"With the positive leading questions, 'yes' means agreement with the
positive proposition and 'no' means disagreement.
In general, I have not noticed any unexpected use of 'yes' or 'no' in
Koromfe vis-a-vis English usage.
1.1.1.2.4.2.2 Question-word questions
When considering the reduction of answers to wh-questions it is practical
to treat questioned noun-phrases and prepositional phrases separately from
questioned verbs.
1.1.1.2.4.2.2.1 Questioned noun phrases and prepositional phrases
As mentioned above, the answer to a wh-questioned noun-phrase normally
involves emphasis with the emphatic particle la (or dJ, if negative). If the
answer is a full sentence, the answer element is emphasized (Le. moved to
the front of the main clause and followed by la). An example question is
given in (75) and its full answer in (76).

1.1.1.2.1.2.1 Expecting the answer yesThe yes-no questions suggesting a positive response are formed syntactically in an identical way to the neutral yes-no questions (i.e. positive declarative sentence plus sentence-final question particle), but use different
question particles. There are two particles, kal and d:J which are used in
this type of yes-no question. Both particles are also words in their own
right: kal is a comparative particle meaning 'rather' or 'more (than)', and
d:J is the negative copula or emphatic particle (corresponding to the positive particle La). The examples given in (17}--(22) correspond to those in
the (positive) declarative sentences (5)-(10) and the neutral questions
(11)-( 16). Note that the position of the question particle (always sentencefinal) is the same in all types of yes-no questions. Here, only examples
with kal have been given; the examples with d:J are identical when the
question particle is switched.

"1.1.1.2.1.2.2 Expecting the answer noYes-no questions which expect the answer no have the structure of a
negative declarative sentence, plus a sentence-final question particle. The
question particles, kaf and d:J, are identical with those of the corresponding yes-no questions that expect the answer yes. Since the correspondence
is so regular, only a single example is given here, in (23).

1.1.1.2.4.2.1 Yes-no questions
1.1.1.2.4.2.1.1 Wordsfor yes', 'no', 'maybe'
The words for 'yes' and 'no' in Koromfe vary slightly (stylistically?) in
their phonetic realization - I have therefore transcribed them in greater
phonetic detail than usual. Also, these words are accompanied by a distinctive intonation pattern, which I have marked with high and low tone
marks, where appropriate, in the examples given here. It seems that the
most important thing about these words is that when disyllabic, 'yes' always has a rising tone pattern (LH) and 'no' a falling pattern (HL).

"1.1.1.2.4.1 Answers as a distinct speech act
Answers cannot be considered to be a distinct type of speech act from a
structural point of view, i.e. there is no special structural distinction between indicative sentences and answers, except that answers can be elliptical (see § 1.1.1.2.4.2. below). Typically, a reply to a question-word question will involve the topicalizing/emphatic particle la, and a reply to a yesno question some kind of yes/no/maybe word (see § 1.1.1.2.4.2.1.1. below).",[68]
"1.1.1.2.3 Echo-questionsEcho-questions usually take the same form as the corresponding direct
yes-no and wh-questions. But also, the question particle (bl etc.) can be29Syntax
omitted or the wh-word questioned in situ. An example of each type of
these specific echo-questions is given in the following sub-sections.
The restrictions on the structure of echo-questions are the same as
those on normal yes-no and wh-questions. There seem to be no additional
restrictions on in situ echo-questions, so long as the corresponding normal
wh-question (with movement) is also well-formed.
A strategy which my informants preferred was to avoid echo-questions
by using a paraphrase involving the verb say, on the lines of 'Did you say:
X?' or 'Where do you say you are going?'.

1.3.1.1.3 Or-coordination
In indicative sentences the coordinator is maa, and the structure S) - maa

In alternative yes-no questions it is possible to juxtapose sentences;
there is also a coordinator jaa that is specific to such yes-no questions.

1.11.2.2.3.4 No markingThe absence of any marking is the general case, barring the optional pronoun mentioned in § 1.11.2.2.3.2 above.
1.11.3 Focus of a yes-no questionI have never found nor been able to elicit a focused yes-no question, even
though my suspicion is it ought to be possible to stick a yes-no question
particle on the end of any sentence whatsoever. However, it is possible to
use a yes-no question immediately following a topic NP, as in (365).

"'Then Hippo also said: ""He cheated me too, telling me to bring my child, and
saying that he would raise him outdoors (=on land), (and) he would give (him
back to me).'""In sentence (3) the conjunction ke is used immediately before an exclamation which is a part of the directly quoted speech; in (4), on the other
hand, there is no ke even though the immediately following sentence is a
part of Hippo's speech (being directly quoted by the narrator). The ke of
11Syntaxthe following clause is analysable as introducing either embedded indirectly quoted speech (what Rabbit had said to Hippo), or an indirect imperative ( 'I ought to bring my child ').
The quoted speech itself is not marked morphologically or syntactically except by the usual 'deictic shifts' of pronouns, adverbials, etc. that
are made in indirect speech. No significant changes of the verb form take
place in directly or indirectly quoted speech.
1.1.1.2 Interrogative sentencesThe typical intonation pattern for all types of question in Koromfe is not
normally distinct from that of statements (cf. §3.3.4.1.1-2 below), i.e. a
high pitch at the beginning of the sentence, followed by a gradual fall of
pitch up to the end of the question. This means that in general all question
words at the beginning of a sentence are on a high pitch, and all yes-no
question particles at the end of a sentence have a low pitch. In addition,
the high pitch on the sentence-initial wh-e1ement remains at a constant
high pitch on the whole syntactic constituent.
Optionally, the sentence-final question particle can be on a high pitch
or lengthened, in which case the question is especially emphasized.
1.1.1.2.1 Yes-no questions
1.1.1.2.1.1 NeutralNeutral yes-no questions in Koromfe are formed by adding a sentencefinal question particle (glossed as QUEST. below) to a (positive) declarative
sentence. There is no inversion or other change in the linear order of the
sentence constituents. A set of typical declarative sentences with varying
numbers and types of noun phrases are given in (5}--(10), and the corresponding neutral yes-no questions in (11}--( 16).

"In these alternative yes-no questions, the question particle hI is always
on a high pitch. (NB: Unlike other Gur languages, Koromfe has no tones.)
Also, there is a slight pause, or pause effect, after hI. Note the variations
(all optional) in the tense of the repeated verb and even in the choice of16Syntaxlexical verb (hal) for Z:Jmmaa), which indicate that this construction is not
as grammaticalized as, say, tag questions in English.
There also exists an optional coordinating element jaa which, if used,
is positioned at the beginning of the second clause (i.e. after the short
pause after hI). An example is given in (30).

"1.1.1.2.3.5 The elements of the sentence which can be subject to echoquestioning
There are no restrictions on the elements of the sentence which can be
echo-questioned; this is hardly surprising, considering that the structure of
echo-questions repeats the original question verbatim.
1.1.1.2.3.6 Echo-questioning of more than one element at a time
It is possible to echo-question a double question only insofar as double or
multiple questions are tolerated at all (cf. § 1.1.1.2.2.1.6 above).
1.1.1.2.3. 7 Questioning of the different elements (word-types)The questioning of the various elements of the sentence, be they words,
phrases or other structures, always involves repetition of the normal, nonecho question preceded by some introductory expression indicating 'Did
you say X' or 'Do you mean X' (such as handa in the above examples).
1.1.1.2.4 Answers
Answers in Koromfe can take the form of full or incomplete sentences.
The full sentence answers have the structure of the declarative sentence

incomplete answers are described in more detail.","[67, 68]"
"1.1.1.2.3.3 Yes-no question echo-questions

introductory expression indicating 'Did you say X' or 'Do you mean X'.

"The minimal reply to such a question has the form 'NP verb la', as shown
in (85), where NP is the subject noun phrase of the sentence (or, optionally, a pronoun substitute) and verb is finite. It is impossible to omit this
subject NP in answer to a question such as (84) (e.g. *gondu la). Note that
in (85) the emphatic particle la qualifies a finite verb.
If an embedded verb phrase is questioned, however, it is possible
(marginally) to have a gerund (i.e. non-finite) verb form, as exemplified in
the question-answer pair (86)-(87).

There are two normal ways of forming an imperative sentence in Koromfe:
either with a true imperative (which is restricted to the 2nd person, singular or plural) or with a full sentence (in all persons) introduced by the
conjunction ke. In §1.1.1.3.1.1 a third possibility, with the omission of ke,
is described; my informants never gave such imperative forms spontaneously. In effect, they are just declarative sentences used as imperatives.",[71]

"1.1.1.2.2 Question-word questionsThere are two basic types ofwh-questions: those in which the (constituent
containing the) wh-element is moved to the beginning of the clause (main
or embedded), and those in which the wh-element remains at its original
position in the sentence (in situ wh-questions).
1.1.1.2.2.1 Elements of the sentence that can be questionedInterrogative main clauses in Koromfe normally have the wh-word or
phrase in initial position, and no overt marking of the position which it
would occupy in the corresponding indicative sentence. The wh-word or
phrase is optionally followed by the emphatic particle lao I have found no
case where the presence or absence of la is obligatory. The negative emphatic particle d:J cannot be used in this way.
Interrogative main clauses with the wh-element in situ are rare except
in echo-questions (see §1.1.1.2.3. below).
1.1.1.2.2.1.1 Constituents of the main clauseAny NP or PP of a main clause can be questioned. The verb or VP can
only be questioned indirectly (see (39) below). Adverbial questions are
restricted to 'where', 'when' and 'how', plus the questioning of the postposition in a PP. Other adverbial questions such as 'why' involve questioned NPs.
The following examples show the questioning of a whole noun-phrase
as subject (31), direct object (32)-(33) and indirect object (34).",[52]
"Interestingly, a postposition can itself also be questioned, as shown in
(55). A typical answer would then be 'in front of it' or 'behind it'.

Stress is not affected by morphological processes and compounding, and
Koromfe has no tones. There are no changes in the segmental pattern due
to the intonation pattern, with the exception of the lengthened yes-no
question particle described in § 1.1.1.2.1.1 above. Therefore the rest of
§3.S of the questionnaire is inapplicable.","[494, 495]"

3.3.4.1.2 Yes-no question intonation
The intonation of yes-no questions is identical to that of statements exemplified above, with the exception that the sentence-final question particle
(such as [bID can optionally have a high pitch, and is often lengthened.
Both modifications imply a more insistent kind of questioning.
3.3.4.2 The intonation peak in normal (non-contrastive, non-emphatic)
intonation
Normally the first stress-phrase of the word receives the intonational peak.
In nori-contrastive, non-emphatic sentences this is either an adverbial or
the subject NP.
3.3.4.3 Emphatic intonation
All emphatic intonations involve giving phrasal stress to some phrase in
the sentence. The greater the emphasis, the more prominent the pitch differential.
3.3.4.4 Contrastive (phrasal) stress
Normally, only one element in a sentence can have contrastive phrasal
stress. As with all other stress types, contrastive stress is effected by giving phrasal stress to some phrase in the sentence, as exemplified above.
Since intonation and phrasal stress involve the same mechanisms,
§3.3.4.S-6 are inapplicable.","[468, 469]"
"'Where will he go and when?' (More precisely: 'Where does he want to go and
when is his departure?')1.1.1.2.2.2 Changes to the questioned elementThe questioned element is moved to sentence-initial position in nonnal
wh-questions (see examples (32)-{34) above), but can be left in situ in
embedded clauses (see the 'a' fonns of (40}-(43) above) and echoquestions (see §1.1.1.2.3. below). This sentence-initial position is then no
longer available for a topicalized element because the questioned element
occupies its structural position.
1.1.1.2.2.2.1 No changeThe questioned element is left unchanged only in echo-questions (where it
is the only possible structure - cf. § 1.1.1.2.3 below) and in parts of double questions (cf. § 1.1.1.2.2.1.6 above).
1.1.1.2.2.2.2 Movement to initial positionMovement to initial position is the nonnal case in non-embedded whquestions (see the examples in § 1.1.1.2.2.1 above).
1.1.1.2.2.2.3 Movement to preverbal positionMovement to preverbal position as such does not occur. When a subject
NP is questioned, it remains in pre-verbal position, but is not moved there.
1.1.1.2.2.2.4 CleftingThe question structures involving the emphatic particle la might perhaps
be regarded as a kind of clefted structure if the la is interpreted as being
the copula. However, I do not consider them to be clefted. There is nothing
which corresponds to a relative pronoun or particle in this structure. Thus
parallel to (33), repeated here, we also have (65) with la intervening between the question-word and the rest of the sentence.",[63]
"'He became one-eyed. '66Syntax
1.2.1.2 Verbal sentences
1.2.1.2.1 Verbs without subjects or with dummy subjectsNormally, every verb must have an overt subject. But in the short utterances of the type NP-la (185), PP-d.J (186) or ADVERBIAL-la (the last 2
words of (187» the emphatic particle la might be considered to be the
copula. In this case, we would have to say that these sentences have no
subject NP (at least for the second case). However, despite their fullsentence glosses, I do not consider these phrases to be full sentences of
Koromfe, but either elliptical sentences or non-sentential exclamatory
utterances akin to short answers to question-word questions. 25

"1.1.1.2.2.2.5 Intonation nucleusIn all wh-question structures discussed here the questioned element is
usually the intonation nucleus, i.e. it is the highest pitch in the sentence either by default, when sentence-initial, or by contrastive intonation when
in situ.
1.1.1.2.2.2.6 Other possibilitiesThere are no other changes to the questioned element.
1.1.1.2.2.2. 7 Movement of other elements of the clause together with the
questioned elementWhen the questioned element is moved, no other parts of the sentence can
be moved with it, except that a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase must
be moved as a whole when any part of it is questioned. Thus pre/postpositions cannot be stranded. A particularly striking example of this
is (66), where the postposition of a PP is questioned:

"1.1.1.2.2.1.2 Constituents o/subordinate clausesIn subordinate clauses, it is possible, and usual, to question in situ those
words and phrases which in single-clause questions must occur sentenceinitially (see the 'a' examples in (40)-{43) below). However, it is also
possible to move the wh-word or phrase from an embedded non-subject
position to the embedded-clause-initial position (see the 'b' forms of (40)-(43», or to the matrix-clause-initial position the (the 'c' forms of (40)-(43» - except for the embedded subject, which can only be questioned in
subordinate-clause-initial position (which is also in situ). In other words,
an embedded subject NP cannot be moved at all. If an ambiguous sequence of constituents results from wh-movement, the wh-word is interpreted with the matrix, not the embedded sentence, e.g. in (42b).
Recall that the emphatic particle la, which is found in many of these
examples, is optional in all question-word clauses. However, since it only
occurs in 'clause-second' position, it can never follow an in situ wh-word
that is located to the right of the verb (e.g. an unmoved direct or indirect
object).",[54]
"1.1.1.2.2.1.6 Questioning more than one thing in a sentence
According to my informants, double questions within one clause are hypothetically possible, but never used. In examples which they gave under
protest, of which two are given in (61}-{62), the question words remain in
situ.

Otherwise indirect questions are syntactically identical to direct questions, although my impression is that the optional emphatic particle fa is

therefore §2.1.2.6.1.6.1 is omitted.
2.1.2.6.2 Other question wordsThere is never any differences between the forms of question words used
in direct and indirect questions. The other question words are listed in

The 1 of Ibl seems to be the same morpheme (possibly the 'basic nonhuman' plural suffix -I used as a prefix) which can be found at the beginning of all cardinal numerals from 2 to 9.
The word na1)kaa looks like a compound of naN (found in the deictics
nandl and na1)sa - cf. §2.1.1.10.1 above) and a reduced version of the
word kana; in other words, the two words for 'how' are basically the same
word.
2.1.2. 7 Relative pronouns and other relative words
2.1.2. 7.1 Special relative pronouns
Only one of the relative pronouns, the human plural form bEnama has no
other usage in the language.
2.1.2.7.1.1 Types ofrelative pronouns
2.1.2.7.1.1.1 RestrictiveThe relative pronouns ala and bEnama are specific as to their humanness
and number. The 'non-specific' relative pronoun k5N is morphologically
invariant in all its many usages; it can also be used in place of either of the
specific relative pronouns ala or bmama.","[298, 299]"
"VLaka1Jabuild EMPH. be hard'What did he say is difficult to build?' (Wh-word in situ.)The element which normally appears in the position next to a subordinating conjunction is the subject of the subordinate clause, since most
subordinating conjunctions are located at the beginning of the subordinate
clause. There is no restriction on the in situ questioning of this element (cf.
(43a)), but when it is questioned in main-clause-initial position, a pronoun
copy must occupy its 'original' position in the subordinate clause (cf.
(43b )). There are also pragmatically/semantically non-preferred constellations of pronouns, probably due to ambiguity of reference.
With the subordinating conjunction k5N,4 on the other hand, only in
situ questioning is allowed. This conjunction is located between the subject NP and the finite verb of the subordinate clause (when the subject NP
is not a pronoun), and so the in situ question structure happens to have the
questioned element in main-clause-initial position when the order of
clauses is 'subordinate - main'. In other words, (45c) derives from (45a)
but not from (45b). A sentence such as *ala 0 kure (a) dIU k5m bene Ie
derived from (45b) is quite impossible, as is any other question involving
movement of the questioned element out of the k5N-clause to main-clauseinitial position.",[57]
"2.1.8.2 Positions occupied by the clitics
2.1.8.2.1 PreverbalThe preverbal position is occupied by personal pronoun subject clitics. See
§2.1.8.1.1 for details. If a negative particle is present, it intervenes between the subject and the verb, as do the adverbs handa 'really' and da 'in
the past' (cf. §1.2.1.3.2.1).
2.1.8.2.2 PostverbalThe suffixal personal pronoun clitics occupy the postverbal position when
they are the object (direct or indirect) or the complement of the verb (see
§2.1.8.1.1 for details).
2.1.8.2.3 Sentence-finalThe interrogative particles of the various types of yes-no questions
(described in § 1.1.1.2.1) occupy the sentence-final position.
2.1.8.2.4 Sentence-initialThe only clitic, if such it is, which occupies the sentence-initial position is
the sentential relative or sentence connective b described in § 1.1.2.3.2
above.
2.1.8.2.5 Sentence-second positionThere are no clitics (or anything else) in Koromfe which occupy the sentence-second position.",[350]
"'Why didn't he give the knife to his younger brother?' (Lit.: 'What resulted in
(the fact that) he didn't give the knife to his younger brother/sister?')A verb phrase cannot be questioned directly in Koromfe. The workaround
construction that is used is similar to that of English: the verb 'do' is used
with a questioned NP object, as shown in (39).

"1.1.1.2.2.1.5 Elements ofcoordinate structuresThe coordinating conjunction of Koromfe, la, is homophonous with the

preference whether one considers sentences such as (56) to involve a coordinate structure (la dab 'and hirnlher') or a prepositional phrase (la
dab 'with hirnlher'). The fact that la dab occurs in the position following
the finite verb indicates to me that it is in fact a prepositional phrase. Sentences such as *ala la dab la bE or *ala la la dab bE are impossible. According to my informants, this case is not questioning within a coordinate
structure, and other elements of coordinate structures cannot be questioned.

2.1.2.6.1 Interrogative pronouns
2.1.2.6.1.1 Types of interrogative pronoun

in (612). No non-human plural or diminutive form exists. The word ase is
phonologically disharmonic, indicating that it the initial a may be the article. Since § 1.1.1.2.2.1.1 contains many examples, no further ones will be
given here.",[296]
"313Morphology
2.1.8.1.3 Reflexive pronounsThe reflexive pronouns, where used (often a bare verb has a reflexive
meaning) are non-clitic, consisting of the word gIllt: 'self' with a prefixal
possessive clitic pronoun, e.g. dd gille 'himself'.
2.1.8.1.4 Reciprocal pronounsThe reciprocal pronoun dombi\, which is in fact the plural of the noun
dono 'comrade', is not a clitic, but behaves syntactically and morphologically like any other common noun.
2.1.8.1.5 A uxiliary verbsThere are no clitic auxiliary verbs; there is no morphological class of auxiliary verbs as distinct from full verbs - in other words, every verb which
is used as an auxiliary also has its own meaning as a full verb.
2.1.8.1.6 Sentence particlesThere are two types of particle which might be considered sentence particles: the sentence-final interrogative particles and the preverbal negative
particles (ba and arguably also aa). The interrogative particles are described in § 1.1.1.2.1 and the negative particles in § 1.4.1. I do not consider
the (apparently) sentence-initial particle handa of the yes-no question
echo-questions in § 1.1.1.2.3.3 to be truly sentence-initial, but rather to be
an ellipsis of something like n handa bole ke ... 'Did you really say that...',
where handa is a pre-verbal adverb (cf. § 1.2.1.3 .2.1 above).
2.1.8.1.7 Sentence connectivesThe element b which is described in § 1.1.2.3.2 above as a sentential relative pronoun might instead be considered to be a sentence connective. It is
the only such element in Koromfe.
2.1.8.1.8 Anaphoric particlesThere are no anaphoric particles.
2.1.8.1.9 Others
2.1.8.1.9.1 Possessive adjectivesThe possessive adjective clitics are formally identical with the subject
clitics found on verbs. The non-clitic (disjunctive or free) pronouns can
314Morphologyalso be used. Sentences (716)-{717) were the first two uttered to me in

possessive adjective mab, the second the clitic possessive adjective mao

1.1.2.3.4 Treatment of the element in the relative clause corresponding to
the head noun
The element in the relative clause corresponding to the head noun is replaced with a relative pronoun. There are two types of relative pronoun,
which I will term specific and non-specific. The SPECIFIC relative pronouns
are quite marginal: the two existing pronouns (ala SQ., bEnama PL.) are
restricted to human NPs. The singular is formally identical to the corresponding question word, but the plural question word, alama, bears no
resemblance to the corresponding relative pronoun bEnama. The NONSPECIFIC relative pronoun k5N is used in these and all other cases. Examples of specific relative pronouns are given in (111)-( 112) and their
equivalents with the non-specific relative pronoun in (114)-(115).","[80, 81]"
