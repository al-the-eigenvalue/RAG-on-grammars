3.12 Question words
3. 12. 1 Polar question markersPolar questions can be formed without any overt morphological marking, as long as the
intonation is rising. But generally, either of two question markers, e or i, is used. Both
question markers are utterance-final clitics. The marker i (which is homophonous, if not
identical, to the element 'yes' = i or iyo, presumably 'yes' + 0 'inclusive disjunction') seems to
be the more general, since it also occurs on content questions.
The difference between -e and - i lies in expectations on the part of the speaker.
Informants characterised the contrast in terms of e requiring a quick answer and i marking
questions in general. When a positive -i.e. agreeing-answer is expected, -e is used, as in
examples (3. 1 47) and (3 . 1 4 8).
(3 . 1 47)A -ngkek
dut e?
2SG-skin hot Q
You are hot, aren't you?",[84]
"An imperative (= declarative with second person subject), as in example (3. 1 50), which
does not use the question marker, is less polite.
(3 . 1 50)A -yai
bi-dani mem di-ngat.
2SG-get to-me
I SG-see
for
Let me see it. (lit Give to me so I (can) see (it).)The contrast between e and i is found in the sequence of the questions in (3 . 1 5 1 ), directed
by the two Mandacan brothers to the Dutch sergeant Kokkelink. The first one expects that
Kokkelink will indeed answer positively, the second one is an open request.
(3. 1 5 1 )A-ngon

Do you love us the Arfak people? If you do, would you allow us to hide you?
3. 12.2 Content questionsContent questions use a question word as well as the marker i. The question marker is
always present. If it follows a word with final high front vowel, the phonetic result is a long
[i:]. This same form seems to be part of the Q-word 'what' mindei, which I take to be made
up of mun 'something' + de 'POSS' + i 'Q-marker'. Thus, if mindei is utterance-final the
realisation is [m�ndeyi]:
(3 . 1 52)A -pim
mindei-i?
tut
2SG-cry

Why are you crying?",[85]
"The expected answer is: [yo, di-ngkek dut 'yes, I'm hot'.
(3 . 1 48)li-ttei

QMorphology69Similarly, the expected answer to (3 . 1 48) is: Iyo, ni-ttei ha hi big 'Yes, we (excl.) didn't bring
a bird'. In contrast, a request, as in (3 . 1 49), does not presume a positive answer.
(3 . 1 49)A -yai

"1Introduction1.1 BackgroundWhen the multidisciplinary program ISIR was conceived at the end of 1 992, the focus
was on the south-west of the Bird's Head peninsula of Irian Jaya. At the same time, we
realised that a detailed study of languages spoken in the eastern part of the Bird's Head was
necessary if we wanted to obtain a more complete picture of the so-called West-Papuan
phylum and other language groups in this area. One intriguing target was what was known as
a phylum-level isolate in the eastern part of the Bird's Head: Hatam.
Not much was known. We knew that missionaries of TEAM (The Evangelical Alliance
Mission) were working on a bible translation in that language, but no linguistic description
was available. The oldest information on the language was a (very) short article by Loukotka,
which contains a few words of the language. ' Cowan ( 1 953) does not contain any Hatam
material. He presents some data on what he calls Mansibaber, which can be identified as
Meyah or related Moskona, and Manikion (equated with Mantion), which can be identified
as Sougb.
In Voorhoeve (1 975) and Wurm and Hattori ( 1 98 1 ) Hatam and Borai are treated as
related languages, clearly separate from neighbouring language groups. In later publications,
Borai has disappeared and Hatam is listed as an isolate (Voorhoeve ( 1 987a, 1 987b), Silzer
and Heikkinen ( 1 99 1 )). In fact, Voorhoeve ( 1 9 8 7b:9 1 ) substitutes the name Tinam for
Hatam and Silzer and Heikkinen ( 1 9 9 1 : 50) include Borai together with a number of other
names as alternatives for Hatam.
Similarly, not much was known about Manikion or Mantion, Meyah or Moskona. As the
ISIR program started in 1 99 3 we learned that members of the Summer Institute of
Linguistics were active in Meyah (and Moskona), and that Manikion was in fact a derogatory
term for people who call themselves Sougb. In Sougb also, TEAM missionaries were
involved in bible translation, but no linguistic description was available.
Our plan, then, was to try to increase our knowledge of these languages, either through our
own fieldwork or through material from SIL linguists. The main question was: What kind of
language is Hatam? Related questions were: What is the status of Borai? Does it exist as a
separate language? Is it possible to get some more information on Sougb?
The answer to the first question is found in this monograph, with some preliminary
information on the related questions provided in this introduction (see § 1 .2).","[16, 17]"

in (3 . 1 63) is reflected in form and clausal position. The former expresses 'reason' or
'purpose' -'for what (are you crying)?', while the latter expresses cause-'what was it that
(you are late)?' I have not seen the form nggon in other combinations, thus cannot give a
separate gloss for it.
Notice that WHO questions, questions involving nominal predicates and this cause/reason
question all use the given marker ri, which seems to close the first constituent, as also in:

TIME and QUANTITY both use the Q-word pig. The temporal question word,

restricted to initial position, as in example (3 . 1 6 1 ). When quantity is questioned, the final
position is required (3 . 1 62), with the question marker immediately following, phonetically
linked by a palatal fricative [<I>icyi].

already3.11 Textual deixisThere are two monosyllabic words that are best described as having some function in
textual deixis. That is, they function in the domain of givenness and topichood or even
emphasis, contrast and focus. But these terms are not easily defined, and none of them seem
to be an adequate label for either ri or ne. Yet, for want of better terms, I have chosen GIVen
as gloss for ri, and TOPic for ne. Both of these words may carry stress.
3. 1 1. 1 Given marker riThe 'given marker' ri is used in a variety of contexts, but it always determines the
preceding constituent. In example (3 . 1 37), which are possible answers to the question where
something is located, it links the preceding pronoun to the following demonstrative.

"It should be clear from this short description that a number of questions remain. For
example, what exactly are the factors that determine differences such as between (2.73) and
(2.74)? Other topics which need further research are the geminates. At least for the bilabialPhonology39and alveolar nasals and for voiceless stops of three points of articulation enough evidence for
geminates has been given. Possibly there are also geminates for the palatal stop and the
liquid. Whether geminates contrast in voice, as the orthography suggests, remains a question.
Regarding the voiced-voiceless opposition, my tentative conclusion is that this holds only
for the onset of stressed syllables.
Possibly a basic template for the prosodic form of lexical items in Hatam could account
for syllabic nasals, vowel or consonant status of VV(V) sequences, and occurrence
restrictions of geminates and certain vowels. But that would require a more theoretical
treatment than I considered desirable for this descriptive study.
I hope to have at least indicated that Hatam is characterised by a clear iambic metre which
has full clauses or utterances as its domain, and not some kind of limited word stress.","[54, 55]"
"98Ger P. ReesinkSuch sequences are all necessarily same-subject, in contrast with similar sequences
interrupted by ba 'and' or lene 'then' (see §4.7. 1 ), which may have either same or different
subjects. When explicit conjunctions are employed it is clear that the sequence involves
coordination of clauses. The same observation holds for sequences interrupted by a pause, as
in example (4.97). But the question is, what is the status of sequences without connectives?
Are they asyndetically coordinated clauses? Does Hatam require an analysis positing a
special class of serial verb constructions? What happens to verbal prefixation in close verbal
sequences? What syntactic restrictions are placed on various sequences? In this preliminary
descriptive work I refrain from theoretical commitments with regard to the issue of serial
verb constructions. I have tried to gather data that seems to be relevant to the matter, and will
present that without too much interpretation.
In order to at least partly answer these questions I will discuss morphological and syntactic
features of the following categories: (i) Directional verb sequences, (ii) Instrumental verb
sequences, (iii) Purposive verb sequences, (iv) Perception verbs + complements, and (v)
General juxtaposition. These sections are then followed by a discussion of the scope of
negation.
4.5. 1 Directional verb sequencesDirectional verb sequences may be divided into:
(i)V l = Directional (± Adverbial) + V2(ii)V l = Action (± Object) + V2= Directional(i)When V I is a directional verb, such as ug 'go (away from deictic centre)' or kwei
'come (to deictic centre)"" and it is immediately followed by V 2 , then subject
prefixation is obligatorily absent on the second verb, as in:
(4.98)Api ni-kwei
kwen tut
sop-nya -o
munggwom-nya-o.
then l EXC-come cook with woman-PL-or child-PL-or
Then we'd come and cook (the meat) with the women and children.
*Api ni-kwei ni-kwen tut sop-nya-o.","[113, 114]"
"If those instances of non-syllabic high vowels are indeed consonants, then two more
tautosyllabic clusters should be recognised, as [velar] + Iwl in example (2.4 1 ) and /hw/ or /hyl
in (2 .42).

to look after2.9 Syllable structureA number of observations made in earlier sections are relevant to an account of the
syllable and word structure of Hatam. I want to begin by giving the ev patterns found in
monosyllabic words. Whereas there is only one full lexical item with just V (2.43), the other
phonemic vowels (2.44) occur as clitics. That is, they always form the nucleus of a syllable
whose onset is taken from the last segment of the previous word.

voicing is neutralised, and n o palatal stops or /hi are allowed.",[45]

Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) priority programme 'The Irian Jaya Studies: a
Programme for Interdisciplinary Research' (ISIR), financed by the Netherlands Foundation
for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO). The programme is carried out in
cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, The Indonesian Institute of
Sciences).
I would like to thank Dr Hasan Alwi, head of the Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan
Bahasa (National Centre for Language Development), for his willingness to be the sponsor of
the linguistic studies carried out under the auspices of ISIR.
In order to study the Hatam language in the Bird's Head area of Irian Jaya I also needed
and readily obtained permission from the authorities in Jayapura, Irian Jaya, and more
specifically in the regency (Kabupaten) Manokwari. I thank the heads of Sospol (Direktorat
Jenderal Sosial Politik) and Bappeda (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah) for
their permission.
But with just the permission and support of the governmental authorities it is hard to study
a regional language such as Hatam. During my first visit to Manokwari, Rogier Gruys gave
me many useful suggestions about whom I should contact. So, before I even travelled to
Hatam territory, I visited the office of World Wide Fund for Nature, where various Hatam
speakers were employed. The director, Daud Womsiwor, arranged for me to meet with
Yohanes Wonggor and Marinus Mandacan, both from Mokwam. They taught me a few
useful expressions in Hatam, and supplied me with a letter in Hatam about regulations for the
nature reserve. Yohanes read it on tape and gave me the meaning in Indonesian.
In Minyambou I was welcomed by the missionaries of The Evangelical Alliance Mission,
Dick and Char Griffiths and Walter and Dianne Kennedy. My thanks are due to them for
their hospitality and their help. The TEAM director in Manokwari, Elmer Lorenz, graciously
allowed me to use the organization's address and infrastructure to keep in contact with people
in my home country.
There is no way to learn a language without native speakers willing to teach. Many Hatam
people have been very friendly and helpful. They were willing to tell stories, which I recorded
and transcribed, or just provided words or sentences which I needed in order to make progress
with my analysis. Thanks are due to: andigpoi Tuantiei Dowansiba, and Yoas Wonggor,
Yoas Iwou, Yairus Dowansiba, Erens Morum, Isak Mandacan, Esap Iwou. In particular, the
texts from Tuantiei were not always easy to understand. Hans Iwou, principal of the primary
school in Minyambou, was a patient and astute teacher. He not only helped me understandxiiAcknowledgementsthese difficult texts, but also was able to answer my many questions regarding morphological
and syntactic complexities. When he was not at Minyambou during my second visit in 1 995,
I found his cousins Yakonias Iwou and Yoas Iwou willing to help me with my questions. But
Hans Iwou, living then at Maruni, could again answer some remaining questions, when I
returned from Minyambou to Manokwari in December 1 995.
Finally, I want to express my thanks to two anonymous referees and Bert Voorhoeve for
commenting on a first draft. In particular, Bert had gone through the manuscript with a fine­
tooth comb, and made many valuable suggestions. I want to thank Jelle Miedema, Dianne
van Oosterhout and Leontine Visser for comments on an earlier version of the
anthropological notes in the Introduction. I have benefited from comments by Harry van der
Hulst and Ian Maddieson on the phonology chapter. Cecilia Ode has helped me with the
measurements and printing the spectograms. None of these people are, of course, responsible
for the flaws that remain.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"

"Whether ghai 'scattered around' is indeed a preposition, as indicated in §3. 1 0, or perhaps
better analysed as a verb, is still a question. At any rate, it is found in reduplicated form and
nominalised as a modifier within a noun phrase:

Hans Iwou remarks that sop cin clarifies the pronominal object of this sentence yok. In other words, it
functions as an afterthought.
The term kieba is explained as 'sudah umur tujuh atau delapan bulan 'they already have the age of seven

"3.2 CliticsHatam has a number of clitics. These are monosyllabic morphemes, which are
phonologically attached to a number of different word classes. They are mainly unstressed,
but as the discussion of metrical stress indicated, Hatam may shift stress quite easily away
from content words. Although some clitics can indeed never receive stress, some others can
form a iambic peak.
There are five enclitics. Two occur on clause level: they are interrogative markers -i and
-e, which will be discussed in the section on question words. Two occur mainly on nominal
constituents. The citation marker -a and the inclusive disjunction marker -0 are directly
attached to nouns or the nominal modifiers that may follow in an NP. A third enclitic is the
nominalising device tilsi, which can be attached to nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions.
The alternation of its initial consonant is determined by the coda of the preceding syllable. Of
these enclitics, only -0 may receive stress.
Then there are three proclitics in Hatam: gi- and di- occur with verbs, adjectives and
demonstratives. Neither of these is ever stressed. A third proclitic is a weakened form of the
preposition bak 'for', namely bi- [b�], which has both prepositional and conjunctive functions.
There are instances of stress even on the clitic variant. The three enclitics on nominal
constituents will be discussed first, followed by the three proclitics.
3.2. 1 Citation marker -aWhen nouns are given in isolation they are always given with an unstressed enclitic -a,
which is therefore glossed 'citation marker' (CIT):
(3. 1 5)nab-a
pig-CIT['na.ba]minyei-a
water-CIT[rnI . 'fiey.ya]In running text, many nouns are pronounced with a final [a] or [�], which may be a
weakened variant of [a], even though they do not figure in a list. Nouns with this clitic occur
either at the end of a clause as in example (3 . 1 6), or as preposed object (3 . 1 7), or as subject
of a non-verbal predicate (3 . 1 8). Clause-final -a often is found on imperatives, as in (3 . 1 6).

4.1.2 AdjectivesAdjectives always follow the noun in an NP, when they function as attributives. As shown
in §3 .5, they contrast with verbs in this respect. In attributive position adjectives may occur in
three different shapes: (i) as a bare adjective (example 4. 1 5); (ii) with the relativiser di- (see
§3.2.5) as in (4. 1 6); and (iii) with the 3 SG.POS prefix ni-, as in (4. 1 7). The difference
between the morphological shapes of the attributive adjective is reflected in the free
translations.

wou di-cun
snake REL-short REL-that
that snake which is short(4. 1 7)di-ma

that short one of a snakeIn other words, the relative marker /dV-/ is employed to single out one individual from a
set of possible referents by a particular feature, expressed by the adjective. When the
adjective is marked with the third person singular prefix , it seems to indicate a more
permanent quality. The expression in (4. 1 7) would then refer to a snake that is inherently
short. Whether this is the correct interpretation is not clear. Thus, with respect to (4. 1 8a) and
(4. 1 8b) informants would say that (a) refers to a knife that is curved, while the (b) variant
would refer to a sickle which is bent even more. This could mean a temporary state, or a
permanent one of such a bent sickle. In other words, more data would be needed to ascertain
whether the semantic effect of 3SG.POS prefix is indeed a permanent quality. I have no
evidence to answer the question whether plural prefixes are possible in this construction.

(known) big pigs is referred to first and then further specified for its quantity: 'there are big
pigs known, those two' or 'the big pigs, two of them'.
When no specific nominal reference is present, a classifier is required as head noun:

"32Ger P. Reesinkof fkI versus JgJ. Secondly, I have alternative realisations of words like JdVgoJ 'to cut up', as
in [t;:)go] and [d;:)go]. Thirdly, no geminates are found as onset of a weak syllable.
I suspect that weak syllables may be realised with either voiced consonants, as in example
(2.5 6), or voiceless ones. I am rather cautious in making firm statements, because my
fieldwork was limited to Minyambou, where the two dialects Miriei and Tinam meet. It
seems that Miriei has less voicing than Tinam. Perhaps the contrast in voicing is in the
process of disappearing in Miriei faster than in Tinam. While I have no instances of [b;:)ley]
for pilei 'to shoot', my recordings do have a realisation of [p;:)IJgas] for IbVnggasJ 'goanna' by
a recognised Tinam speaker; see. example (2.60).
2.10 Metrical stressAll lexical items, whether monosyllabic or polysyllabic, allow stress marking, including
CV verbs, such as jo 'be somewhere', ku 'to hide'; nouns, such as b u 'nettle leaf', mo
'shrimp' ; adverbs, such as bu 'again' , and function words, such as ei 'at; to' and ba 'and'.
As mentioned with regard to bisyllabic words, the first syllable is never stressed, except in
two instances. Firstly, the suffix -ni on personal pronouns can never receive stress. Thus dani
'1', nyeni 'we' are never [da. 'ni] or [fie . 'ni]. Secondly, the clitic -a on citation forms of nouns
may never receive stress:

guri-aJig-aJ
Jsar-aJhouse-IND
lattice-IND[nu. 'IJu.gwa]
[gu. 'ri.ya]=
=['iy.ya]
['sa.ra]mountain
chickenNotice that I formulated the stress rule for words in isolation in negative terms. Whereas
suffixed pronouns and monosyllabic nouns show a trochaic pattern, bisyllabic words with or
without a final clitic suggest a iambic pattern. But when these words occur in running speech,
no rule can positively specify which syllable should be assigned stress. Only negatively, first
syllables of polysyllabic words (whether mono- or poly morphemic) can never be stressed,
suggesting a phrasal iambic metrical stress. Accent in Hatam cannot be stated in terms of
word pattern. It is related to a whole utterance or phrasal part thereof. Following a pause, or a
single long syllable, such as the connective ba 'and', a trough comes (almost) always first, as
in:

always have the first syllable stressed: da-ni 'I-this' etc.
The sequence of iambs in Hatam seems to be quite regular and gives a distinctive
rhythmic impression. A sequence of bisyllabic words in an NP maintains stress on words of
different classes in the following:Phonology33(2.60)

Content words, like monosyllabic verbs or nouns, do not necessarily attract stress. It
apparently depends on the overall pattern in the clause. For example, in (2.6 1 ), which
answers the question where a certain item can be found, [no.jo] forms the first iamb, with /jo/
being the peak.
(2.6 1 )

otherIn example (2.62) we find a pattern in which /jo/ forms the trough with the (normally

In the early days in this area, we didn't have kain timur. [Kain tirnur:006]Similarly, the verb coi 'enter' receives primary stress in a .coi kwei 'you-enter come' for
'come in !', whereas in example (2.6 1 ) it forms the trough before the peak on the preposition
ei:

goanna 3SG-flee and 3SG-enter LOC water-CIT NOM
The goanna fled and slid into the water. [Hans:004]
Note that in example (2.63) there is a long pause following the connective ba 'and', which
itself appears to be outside the regular iambic pattern. Between the subject noun binggas and
the verb nang a schwa is produced. The new syllable takes the coda from the preceding one
as its onset. It is not clear whether this is a weak realisation of the citation marker a, or just
an epenthetic vowel to solve the stress clash. I suspect the former, since the strong syllable of
a mono- or bisyllabic lexical item can easily be weakened to form the trough of a iamb, as
illustrated in the next examples. The opposite, strengthening a weak syllable to an iambic
peak, seems to be much less preferred. But there is no ban on it, as jo bi-nyeni in (2.62)
shows. As already pointed out with respect to polysyllabic words, it is quite possible to have
an upbeat consisting of two or three short syllables. Consider the phonetic realisation of
(2.64), which illustrates a series of weak syllables in ni-pilei ' l EXC-shoot' and a weakening
of a monosyllabic lexical item hab 'bird'. The figures under each syllable give the duration in
milliseconds, taking the onset of the pertinent consonants as boundaries.","[47, 48, 49]"

the hiding is done in a quick manner, whereas in (4.8 3b) and (4.8 3c) the adverb is more
sentential: the action followed quickly on some earlier event.
Similarly, the adverbs bu 'again' and cem 'also' may take various positions according to
the required scope. Consider some examples of cem. In (4.86) cem only has the subject dani
'I' in its scope, in (4.87) the predicate with object is focused on, and in (4. 8 8) it is just the
object dihyei 'ground' which is included as a further possible goal of what one can pay for

"3 Morphology3.0 IntroductionThis chapter gives the word classes that appear necessary for a description of Hatam. This
language, like the languages that are claimed to constitute the West-Papuan Phylum, has a
rather limited morphology. Inalienable nouns and verbs are prefixed to index person-number
of possessor and subject. To facilitate the treatment of nouns and verbs, I will first discuss
the personal pronouns. There are a number of clitics which apply either to lexical items or to
clausal constituents. These will be presented before the other word classes are discussed. The
way some of the clitics operate on different word classes can then be described in the
appropriate sections. This chapter then, will provide all the 'building blocks' which are
needed to account for the syntactic structures to be discussed in Chapter 4. In general I will
use the established orthography. At times, when necessary, phonetic realisations will be
specified.
3.1 PronounsAlthough the pronominal prefixes have already been given in §2.6, they are here repeated,
in Table 3 . 1 , to show their relationship with the free forms and other pronominal forms. Here
I employ the established orthography. Recall that the vowel in the prefixes when following a
consonant is the unspecified vowel, most frequently realised as [;:>]. Most prefixes are clearly
related to the free pronouns.
Table 3.1 : Personal pronounsFreePrefixPossessiveEmphaticExclusiveI SGdadi-dit-de*da-ntida-ngkom2SGnaa-a-dena-ntina-ngkom3SGno(k)0; ni-ni-deno-ntino-ngkoml INCnyei(g)-i-denye-ntinye-ngkomnye-ntinye-ngkomje-ntije-ngkoml EXCnyeni-nyen-de/ni-de *2PLjeji-ji-deMorphologyFreePrefixPossessiveEmphaticExclusive3PLyork)i(g)-i-deyo-ntiyo-ngkom1 DUsasi-si-desa-ntisa-ngkom41* The morphophonology of possessive pronouns leaves some questions: most forms clearlyhave a voiced alveolar stop and stress on the second syllable. Native speakers insist that first
singular is dit-de, realised phonetically as [dgtE], which contrasts with an aspirated alveolar
voiceless stop in dete = [dgthE] 'my side'. Likewise nye-nde is realised as [nyente], without
aspiration. Possibly, some remnant of possessive linker is still present in some forms (see also
kinship terms as inalienable nouns in §3.3 . 1 ).
In most instances the free pronouns are suffixed with -ni: dani, nani, noni, nyeni, jeni,
yoni, and sani. The suffix is identical to the near deictic ni 'this', possibly derived from it and
bleached of its deictic meaning. It is not quite clear which factors determine the distribution
of short and long free pronouns. Subject position seems to prefer the suffixed form, as in
example (3. 1 ), and (oblique) object position seems to favour the short forms, as in (3.2). But
this is certainly not a strict rule, as (3.3) shows.

"This phenomenon will be further discussed in §4.4.6. To conclude this section, here is a
minimally contrasting pair to show that -ti and -si are alternative realisations of the
nominaliser:23I suspect that nimbumbati, which Griffiths glosses as 'equipment, parts, furnishings' may be formed in a
similar fashion: ni-mbut-bat-ti '3SG-travel-COLLECTlVE-ti. But this would imply that bat is not restricted
to human relationship terms, as suggested in §3.3.3.
In Griffiths ( \ 994) the gloss is 'planted but not yet producing'.",[61]
"Morphology473.2.5 RelativisersThe relativiser di IdVI is procliticised to demonstratives and adjectives, as well as to
inflected verbs to link these items as modifiers to a head noun, when its referent needs to be
contrasted to a set of possible alternatives. Again, this form is never stressed. Often it is in
combination with no '3SG', as in example (3.39). A form with similar function, but more
anaphoric than ostentive, is po, with a weak variant [p;:)], as on the demonstrative in (3.39).
Their functions will be discussed in §4.6. Some examples are:

"Whether -tut in example (3.96) is a classifying noun for vines, or rather denoting 'runner'
as a part of the plant, is not clear. Both situt 'sweet potato vine' and batut 'vine runner in
general ' (presumably from sieb 'sweet potato' and bab 'vine' respectively) are possible as
nouns with or without a quantifier. Thus, (3.96b) is also acceptable.

[yuhwen]Note that the palatal approximant of the stem /hyeT/ metathesises with !hi to be incorporated
in the unstressed syllable. This process seems optional for the bilabial approximant: [nuhen] is
attested as alternative to [nuhwen].

[yuwak]2.7 Vocoid sequencesThe phonemic status of bilabial and palatal approximants as consonants can best be
argued if we consider which vocoid sequences Hatam allows. Only vocoid sequences
involving high vowels and non-high vowels in either order are attested, as presented in Table
2.3, with first elements in the rows and the second elements in the columns.

phonetic realisations: see examples (2.24)-(2 .28). The actual phonetic realisations differ
considerably, to a large extent depending on the place a word has in an utterance. In isolation,
sequences with [+ HIGH] in second position always form one syllable, as illustrated in (2.24).
Since no further consonant is allowed in the coda, the high vowels could be interpreted as
consonantal approximants. 1 1 This also holds for y [HIGH ] as only onset, as in (2.25).

4. 7.2 Contrastive conjunctionsHatam has two conjunctions, which are morphologically related, to express a contrastive
relation between two clauses. The basic form is lo, which, combined with the third person
pronoun no, gives noro 'but'. Recall that Hatam does not have a phonemic contrast between
[r] and [1]. Nevertheless, I have encountered neither [nolo] nor [co].
4. 7.2. 1 Counterexpectation 10The qualification of 'counterexpectation' is given to the conjunction lo, because in
sentences like (4.2 1 5) and (4.2 1 6) it conveys something of a surprise.

cliticises to the preceding verb, just as ri forms a phonological unit with its preceding nominal
constituent. Its position and function are reminiscent of deictic elements in Papuan languages

"Introduction71 .4 Data collection and presentationThis grammar is based on data collected during two short periods of fieldwork, 1 5
October-30 November 1 994 and 8 November- I I December 1 99 5 , in M inyambou, in the
kecamatan Warmare, Kabupaten Manokwari, Bird's Head, Irian Jaya. These periods were
too short to afford extensive trekking through the area in order to obtain data on dialectal
differences. Instead, I stayed in Minyambou and collected word lists there and in adjacent
Mbenti. From a few speakers I obtained texts from the oral tradition. But I also recorded a
long personal narrative (Yoas Wonggor from Mbenti) and a sermon, given by Habel Iwou in
the church at Minyambou. These narratives in natural speech could be checked and
elaborated on with the excellent help from the principal of the primary school at M inyambou,
Hans Iwou. The dictionaries compiled by Dick Griffiths allowed me fast access to the
vocabulary of Hatam. A first result of this research was published as 'Explorations in Bert's
Head: Hatam' in Baak et al. ( 1 995).
Having done some preliminary analysis on this material I returned to the Hatam area in
the fall of 1 995 to verify and increase my data. A few other texts were recorded, some
myths, a short historical account of events during the Second World War, and two short texts
about 'slave'-trade in the Eastern Bird's Head.
In order to test phonological problems, a number of short sentences with contrasting items
were pronounced by three different speakers, who were prompted in Indonesian. In order to
investigate the status of verb sequences I took sentences from the recorded texts, changed
them into a negative, or a relative construction, manipulated presence or absence of certain
affixation, and asked native speakers what these sentences meant in I ndonesian, or whether
they could be used in a particular situation. The result of this method is that most examples in
this grammar are taken from natural speech, but that the discussion on relative clause and
scope of negation relies more heavily on elicited material. As much as possible, especially
where deemed significant to stress natural language use, I have indicated in brackets from
which recorded text an example is taken. The text references include texts which have not
been included in this volume.
Throughout this volume I attempt to follow, as much as possible, the established
orthography as employed in the published Hatam material, such as the New Testament. The
most obvious discrepancy concerns the spelling of the negative. I n the established
orthography this is bi 'not', but since I believe the word resembles items spelled with final -ig
(for example, often a noticeable friction following the high vowel-see §2.3 for further
details), I have chosen for the spelling big.
In spite of the additional information obtained during my second visit to Minyambou,
many questions remain. In particular, the extent of the phonemic status of geminate
consonants cannot be unequivocally stated. Likewise, the status of various elements described
in the morphology and syntax is rather dubious. This is no surprise, of course, considering
that my analysis is based on fieldwork of only eleven weeks. In a sense, it could be
considered to be rather presumptuous to attempt to write a grammar on the basis of such a
short exposure to a language. While I was in the process of revising an earlier version of this
grammar, an even more presumptuous account of the language was published.
Based on a short trip, Donohue ( 1 997) published a Hatam phonology and grammatical
notes. He does not recognise high vowels in the language, nor any contrast between single and
geminate consonants. He also posits a series of labio-velar consonants, for which there is no
evidence. His ykpe 'house' refers to a compound ig-bei 'house-under'. There are quite a few
data in his paper which show the typical misunderstandings a first survey invariably contains.
For example, he identifies the nasal in nggwen 'sick' and kney 'bad' as the same element,8Ger P. Reesinksignalling a strong denial. In fact, there are no other items that relate in the same way as kei
'good' and kanei 'bad' , which suggests that the formal similarity is just accidental. The word
for 'sick', nggwen, is one of many that begin with a homorganic nasal, but gwen does not
exist, as far as I know. So far, a semantic constant between lexical items that differ only in
the presence or absence of an initial homorganic nasal could not be established. To be fair, it
may be that his data are from a different dialect, spoken near the Anggi lakes, which may
have a Beneficiary marker yp, or a coreferential subject marking prefix ho. In the Tinam
dialect, I have not found anything that suggests a particular morphology to indicate
something like a switch-reference mechanism. This is not the place to make an evaluation of
every item in Donohue's paper. The value of a description depends to a degree on the time
one has been exposed to a language. In other words, the present work too may contain a
number of misunderstandings and wrong analyses, which may show up after a more thorough
acquaintance with the language.
This monograph does not pretend to give more than a preliminary description of Hatam
and I have refrained from extensive discussions of a theoretical nature. This applies in
particular to the phonology, which at first glance appeared to be quite simple, but does
contain a number of problematic issues related to the stress pattern. In the area of syntax , a
theoretical discussion regarding serial verb constructions is avoided. I have simply tried to
arrange my data in such a way that some arguments bearing on that topic can find some
corroboration. Following the chapters on phonology and grammar, I present a few texts, with
annotations.","[22, 23, 24]"

75. 1 70 1 00 200 msecThe first speaker, Yakonias, has more 'pauses', i.e. periods of no voicing, between the
morphemes. The second speaker, Yulius, inserts a schwa between the subject noun biged and
the predicate but, which resyllabifies [b<}.g£.d<}.but]. Yakonias' but.big forms a iamb even
though both syllables are of equal length. Likewise, Yulius' big ba forms a iamb. Significant
is that both instances of iambs last about 300 msec. Interestingly, the verb but 'fall (of rain)'
fonns the trough in the first example and the peak in the second one. Similarly, the negative
adverb is peak in the first, trough in the second one. The duration of these syllables is roughly
the same. But as the wave fonns in Figure 2.2 show, the lack of difference in length appears
to be compensated either by intensity, as the iamb [bi.ba] in the second example, or by pitch,
as [but.bi] in the first example. A preliminary conclusion would be, then, that Hatam fonns a
iambic metrum based on length: short-long. In case of syllables of roughly equal length, the
peak is phonetically realised by intensity or pitch.",[51]

Disambiguation of examples (4. 1 4 1 ) and (4 . 1 42) is possible only on pragmatic grounds.
Not only negative sentences involving perception complements are semantically opaque. The
various verb sequences described in §4.S. 1 -§4.S.S allow similar multiple interpretations,
albeit that some interpretations are more easily available than others. Consider the following
examples: (i) adverbial, (ii) directional verb plus main, (iii) main verb plus directional, (iv)
instrumental, (v) resultative, (vi) speech and (vii) perception verbs with their complements
under negation.

The scope of the negative can be shown by possible continuations of this sentence. Both

but
3PL-cry 3PL-thirsty
but they are crying (because) they are thirsty.
(c) noro
i-pa .
but
3PL-Iaugh
but they are laughing.
Interpretation (b) is the most available one, which is not very surprising, considering the
pragmatics of negation. Universally, it is the adverbial (whether adverb or prepositional
phrase or subordinate clause) which is the first candidate for the scope of negation. She
doesn 't run fast has as its first interpretation 'she runs but not fast'. The logically possible
interpretation 'she doesn't run' is available, but less likely. Why would a speaker supply
more, modifying information about an event that s/he is going to negate anyway? Similar
hierarchies of interpretations are valid for the other negative sequences.
4.5. 62 Negation and directional sequences 0)This category comprises structures in which V I is a directional verb followed by an
unprefixed main verb:
(4. 1 44) (a) Yoni y-ug
bong ei

but they go to sleep in the forest.
(c) Zeu-o
yoni i-bong
ei
igbei
tu.
from-ALT they 3PL-sleep LOC house already
because they are already sleeping in the house.ls
Again, interpretation (b) is the first given when informants are asked what the negative
sentence means. But (c), which restricts the scope of negation to the directional verb, is
available.
4.5. 6.3 Negation and directional sequences (ii)This category is formed by structures in which a prefixed main verb is followed by an
unprefixed directional verb as V2:
(4. 1 4S) (a) Yoni i-krau
munggwom kwei
big.
they 3PL-hold child
come
not
They don't bring the child(ren). (lit. They don't hold the child(ren) hither.)
Sentence (4. 1 4Sa) has as its first reading simply: 'They don't holdlkeep the children, so the
children stay where they are', but it can be felicitously followed by either (b) or (c):
(b) Noro i-krau
munggwom
ug.
but
3PL-hold child
go
Take the children away. (lit. But they hold the children thither.)
(c) Munggwom pima
yo-nti
i-kwei.
child
that
they-self 3PL-come
The children come of their own accord.
In other words, the preferred interpretation of the scope of negation is the whole clause or
the expansion: they may hold the children or not, but at least they are not coming towards the
deictic centre. The second interpretation, namely that negation applies only to the first
predicate and does not involve the direction, is definitely available, as (4. 1 4Sb) shows.
4.5. 6. 4 Negation and instrumental sequencesNegation of a sequence involving an Instrument, as in example (4. 1 46a), has as its first
reading that the scope is restricted to the Instrument. Thus, (b) is the most likely continuation:
(4. 1 46) (a) Di-ba
hamboi di-bi-wim

general morpho-phonological rule for tu/su. Perhaps some similar distinction as was described for silti in
§4.4.6 is at play here.","[123, 124, 125]"
"In the realisations of (2.65) by Yakonias and Yulius (see Figure 2.2), a iamb is formed by a
short and a long syllable, the trough has a duration of roughly 1 00 msec. (range 70> < 1 30),
whereas the peak is twice as long, with a range of 1 50> <250 msec.

"However, the alternative Papuan order is equally possible, either with or without the plurality
morpheme. Thus, next to (4. 1 3a) and (4. 1 4a) it is possible to have the order of (4. 1 3b) and
(4. 1 4b):

andcom .
throwInformants either claim there is no difference, or try to restrict the postnominal
construction to situations where there is some temporal distance. For example, a-de
munggwom-nya '2SG-POS child-PL' is explained as direct address to the hearer, while
munggwom a-de-nya would be used when the children are no longer present. Such an
explanation is hardly relevant to the difference between (4. 1 4a) and (4. 1 4b). My conclusion
is that the postnominal possessives stand in an appositional relation to the possessed noun.
The prenominal position is by far the more frequent one in my data.",[97]
"These restrictions suggest that the palatals may not have phonemic status as other stops or
nasals, that they may be the phonetic merging of an alveolar consonant plus a front high
vowel. But such an interpretation is not quite possible in the light of items such as [cin] 'a
pair' , [tilJ] 'far', and [cErn] 'also' versus [tiyey] 'white'; as well as [jit] 'true' and [jiya]
'chin.CIT' versus [diya] 'slippery'.
Although my own data do not contain instances of palatal stops followed by a vocoid
series with [HIGH] in first position, Griffiths ( 1 994) lists: ciem 'rocks heated for pit cooking'
and diem 'leak through which liquids flow'. These items imply a contrast between [ciyEm]
'heated rocks' and [CErn] 'also' and [diYEm] 'leak' versus [jEm] 'to call ' and [yEm] 'to eat '.
When polymorphemic words are considered, there are more. Consider the verbs yem 'to eat'
and jem 'to call'. Without a prefix the forms [yem] and [jem] mean '3SG.eat' and '3 SG.call'
respectively. With first person singular the forms are IdV-yernl [diyem] and IdV-jernl [dijem],
and with second person plural [jiyem] and [jijem], clearly constituting a contrast between [j]
and [di]. If indeed there is also a geminate member of the series, as Griffiths' jjei 'to crawl'
suggests, the palatal series is parallel to the stops of other points of articulation.
Similarly, the clear contrast between [ni.yay] '3SG-eye' or ' l EXC-take' (morphologically
InV-yayl in both cases) on the one hand and [iiay] 'other side of river' (morphologically liiay/)
on the other suggests that lfiJ may be taken as a fourth phonemic nasal. My conclusion is that
Hatam has a palatal series of stops and nasal, which cannot be equated with a realisation of
the sequence alveolar stoplnasal and front high vowel.
2.5 Syllabic nasalsIn monomorphemic words, Hatam allows nasals preceding homorganic stops and
fricatives. These sequences are not considered to constitute a prenasalised series. Firstly, the
nasals are syllabic, although their duration may be quite short in places. Secondly, the
following stops do contrast in voicing as they do word-initially. Thirdly, not just the stops, but
also the two fricatives lsi and /hi are allowed following nasals. Consider the contrasts in
example (2. 1 7).",[36]

'to call'. The latter uses (bi-)pia 'QUOTE' when it refers to naming persons or objects, as in:

'manipulative' verbs, such as nduk 'to gather' (compare example (4. 1 1 0). Consider:

4.5.5 GeneraljuxtapositionAs the examples in the introduction to this section show, juxtaposition of verbal predicates
is not restricted to the Directional, Instrumental, Purposive and Perception/Speech
complements. As far as I can tell, juxtaposition of verbal predicates -with or without explicit
object NPs in the case of transitive verbs -always involves a same subject sequence. This
'rule' excludes perception and speech verbs as V I , as we have seen. Secondly, juxtaposed
verbs are always both marked with a subject prefix, when applicable. This 'rule' excludes
i) verbs immediately following Directional verbs, ii) Directional verbs specifying direction for
main verbs and iii) optionally, V2's of Instrumental sequences. But even juxtaposedSyntax1 07directional verbs can be prefixed, as can be seen in i-nang y-ug 'they fled and went' in
[Yairus 2:067] (see footnote 1 1 above), and in another instance of intransitive verbs in series:

already{2}-hon
srin
ei
Mbingwam.
3SG-stop block LOC Mbingwam
After the two women had walked and come, he blocked them off at
Mbingwam. [Anggos 033]Some sequences of intransitive verbs could be interpreted as V2 being an adverbial
modifier of V I . Such sequences do not allow an intervening conjunction ba 'and', as shown
by example (4.96), repeated here as (4. 1 3 8); (4. 1 3 8b) is unacceptable.

ni-nggum . . .
l EXC-ask l EXC-hungry

ni-harabani-nggumSequences of transitive verbs are simply tight temporal sequences, which in contrast with
'adverbial sequences' can easily be conjoined by ba 'and':

3PL-take food

They take food (and) host (= put on a big meal) them. [Dowansiba 06 1 ]4.5. 6 Scope of negationAs mentioned in §4.4.9, the negative adverb big (as well as negative imperative au) is
always in clause-final position. I should say rather that it occurs sentence-finally, because, as
seen in example (4. 1 3 1 ) above, negation of a perception verb is effected by big following the
complement clause. It is ungrammatical to have the negative in between the main predicate
and its complement:
(4. 1 40)*Dani di-ngat big
nab yem dit-de
siep.
I
I SG-see not
pig eat
I SG-POS sw.potato
I didn't see that the pig ate my sweet potatoes.","[121, 122, 123]"
"As conveyed by the free translations of examples (4. 1 05) and (4. 1 06), the sequence with
directional verb as y2 seems to function more as a unit than when y2 is some other verb, as
in (4. 1 09). Although [V I = transitive + y2= directional] appears to form a tight sequence,
Hatam does not allow a tighter sequence of action + motion verb with the object of y l after
,
the motion verb: *di-ttei kwei srat 'I-carry come letter .l2 The unweakened form ba 'and' is
allowed in such sequences, as long as the verb following the connective is marked for person­
number of the subject, indicating it has the same referent as the verb preceding it. Thus, a
natural, i.e. unelicited, sentence as in example (4. 1 1 Oa) has various alternative realisations:
(4. 1 1 0) (a) Lene

us
and 1 EXC-carry and 1 EXC-come roast
Then he shot (Pig) again and called us together and we carried (it). And we
came and roasted (it). [Wonggor 1 :056]The first sentence in (4. 1 1 Oa) ends with ni-ttei carrying a final falling intonation, followed
by a (long) pause. It is also possible to merge the two sentences into one, resulting in a
sequence of three verbs, of which only the first one is prefixed. The reason why these three
verbs are asyndetically linked, it seems, is that the second verb is directional kwei. It is
uninflected because it is y2 specifying direction for the transitive verb ttei 'carry', and it is
y l with respect to bam 'roast':
(4. 1 1 0) (b) lene {lj-nduk

GlVThis sentence leaves many questions. Sigau was explained as bencana alam 'natural disaster', while
Griffiths ( 1 994: 68) gives 'storm'. Minyei ud was explained as telaga 'pond, lake', but it may also refer to
'canoe' in that ud is 'stem, trunk' and is also used for 'canoe'. Sibau was explained as the name of a lake.
Thus, the general meaning seems to be that the daughter of one of these sons was drowned, through a storm,
while travelling by canoe on a lake. The syntactic relations between the lexical elements of this line are not
clear to me.
Phonetically this is [ni-deu]; see also footnote 43.","[170, 171]"
"Thus, the first interpretation of (4. 1 47) is 'I hit the pig but it didn't die'. However, 'I didn't hit
the pig, but it died of another cause' is also possible. On the other hand, for the negative

not[noni buy d�I)wage bi]The final IK/ of IngwaK/ 'empty' in example (2.6) is unreleased, preceding a morpheme­
initial stop, and the final /KI of l-ngwaK/ 'forehead' in (2.7) is a voiced velar stop, followed
by a schwa. This schwa could be a transitional element, helping to define a contrast between
final voiced versus voiceless stops, or to shape the preferred rhythmic pattern, but I ratherPhonology17suspect i t t o be a weakened variant o f the citation clitic - a 'CIT' (see §3.2 . 1 ). In other words,
the different realisations are due to the phonetic environment, rather than the inherent
phonological shape.
As far as I know, there are no possible minimal pairs within the word class nouns. Similar
phonetic realisation of nouns such as bed-a 'moon-CIT' or ngwag-a 'forehead-CIT' and
words of other categories, such as the verb bet 'to wait' or adjective ngwak 'empty' never
cause misunderstanding. Only within the class of verbs have I found minimal pairs suggesting
a contrast between voiced and voiceless velar stops in final position, but these are restricted
to verbs with the vowel lui, as in huk 'to chase, hunt' versus hug 'to pour', cuk 'to order'
,
versus cug 'to threaten .6
There does seem to be a phonological contrast in voicing between velar stops in word-final
position, revealing itself in phonetic realisations. This is limited, however, to environments
following high vowels. Consider the following items as given in isolation:
(2.8)!hukl
!hug!
!hu![hukh]; [huk>]
[huW]; [huk>]
[hu]to chase, hunt

[i]; [i9 ]
[til; [ti<;:]torn
house
stoneWords with final lkl or Ig! can both be realised with unreleased voiceless stops. The items
with final Ig! are also (and mainly) realised without a stop in isolation. They end in just a
vowel or an unreleased approximant following lui or a light palatal friction following Iii. The
(palato-)velar consonant does betray itself in the environment of a following consonant. For
example, preceding /hi, there is a contrast between !hukl 'hunt' and Itug! 'pound', as in (2.9).
The voiceless IkI is phonetically realised, the voiced Ig! is not.

l EXC-hunt bird
We hunted birds.[n;)hukha�]These can be made explicit, as Hans Iwou did, when he saw me writing <puk> for 'to pick' (memetik):""oh, ke, phuk>, �ukh itu khetu0. Kalau pakai kata kha itu khetuphintu, kalau ge, itu memeti0, jadi[phug>]""'Oh, ge, [puk>], [pukh] means ketuk ( knock on door), If you use fkI it means ketuk pintu 'knock on a
door', if /g! it means memetik 'pick fruit/flower', so it is [pug]. '
=Thus, in careful speech h e made a difference between an unreleased versus a released velar stop: the former
was used for what he considered to be a final /g!, the latter for fkI. But as we have seen, final stops before a
pause may be realised either way, neutralising voice.","[32, 33]"
"Texts1 33In order to make opaque syntactic structures more transparent I have indicated significant
pauses by a slash. This correlates for almost 1 00% with a rising intonation, signalling that
there is more to come. A falling contour on the final syllable indicates that a sentence has
come to its end. This is indicated with #. In the free translations I have tried to correlate
slashes with commas and # with full stops. Thus natural speech, which is hardly ever
delivered in the neat syntactic structures native speakers offer out of context, is maintained.
This allows the reader to understand apparent diversions from claims made in the grammar
regarding word order or presence/absence of certain morphological markers. At the same
time, at a number of places the recorded material is not clear enough to chose between
certain possible alternatives. This has been indicated in footnotes throughout the texts.
Indonesian loans, which occur sparingly in the four myths but are rather frequent in the text
about Kain Timur, are indicated in bold print.","[148, 149]"

Finally, a construction which expresses that a certain item exists or is available should be
mentioned here. It makes use of the element nonaha, which is best translated as 'there are' or
'it is'. It seems to be a fossilised form of verbal origin: no nV-ha '3SG 3SG-be', which is not
observed with any other verbal prefix. Consider examples (4.40) and (4.4 1 ).

What I call epenthetic vowels here may well involve weakened realisations of the citation
